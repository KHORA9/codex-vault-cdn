All the material was placed unreservedly at my disposal, and I\r\ndesire to make full acknowledgment of this mark of confidence. I desire\r\nalso to express my gratitude to the numerous persons who have readily\r\ngiven their consent to the publication of important letters in which\r\nthey possess a proprietary interest: notably to Emily Lady Ampthill,\r\nLord Clarendon, Lord Derby, Lady Granville, Lady Ermyntrude Malet, Lord\r\nRosebery, the Hon. Rollo Russell, Lord Salisbury, and Lord Sanderson.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr. J. F. Marshall and Mr. Alan Parsons for their\r\nassistance in sifting the enormous mass of documents found at Norfolk\r\nHouse, and to the Hon. Arnold Keppel for a service rendered at a\r\nsubsequent period. Finally, I have to thank Mrs. Wilfrid Ward for an\r\ninteresting contribution entitled \"Lord Lyons in private life,\"\r\ncontaining personal details only available to a near relative.\r\n\r\n  NEWTON.\r\n\r\n_October, 1913._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF VOL.

A sailor's life, however,\r\nmust have been singularly uncongenial to a person of pronounced\r\nsedentary tastes whom nature had obviously designed for a bureaucrat; in\r\nafter years he never alluded to his naval experiences, and it was\r\nprobably with no slight satisfaction that the navy was exchanged for\r\nWinchester. From Winchester he proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, where\r\nhe took his degree in 1838, being apparently at that period a quiet,\r\nwell-behaved, hard-working youth, living carefully upon a modest\r\nallowance, and greatly attached to his parents and family.\r\n\r\nIn the following year he entered the diplomatic service as unpaid\r\nattaché at Athens, where his father occupied the position of Minister.\r\nIn 1844 he became a paid attaché at Athens, and passed thirteen\r\nuneventful years at that post.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of his career, prospects looked far from promising; he\r\nhad started later than usual, being twenty-two at the period of his\r\nentry into the service; younger men were senior to him; he had had no\r\nopportunity of distinguishing himself at Athens, and as he laments in a\r\nletter to the Foreign Secretary, Lord Malmesbury, written in April,\r\n1852, he felt 'mortified and humiliated that a man six years younger\r\nthan himself had been passed over him as Secretary to the Legation in\r\nwhich he had served for thirteen years.' Promotion indeed seemed so\r\nremote that, having reached the age of thirty-five, he seriously\r\ncontemplated abandoning diplomacy altogether.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, there was no cause for uneasiness. In 1852 he was\r\ntransferred as paid attaché to Dresden, and early in the following year\r\nreceived the gratifying intimation that Lord John Russell, who had been\r\nstruck with his capacity, had appointed him paid attaché at Rome. 'What\r\nI mean for him,' wrote Lord John Russell, 'is to succeed Mr. Petre, and\r\nto conduct the Roman Mission, with £500 a year. If there were any post\r\nof Secretary of Legation vacant I should gladly offer it to him, as I\r\nhave a very good opinion of him.' The importance of the post at Rome\r\nconsisted in the fact that, whereas technically dependent on the Tuscan\r\nMission at Florence, it was virtually semi-independent, and might\r\neasily form an excellent stepping-stone to higher and more important\r\nappointments if activity and discretion were displayed.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1853, Lyons started for his new post carrying despatches, and\r\nas an illustration of the conditions of travel upon the continent at\r\nthat period, it is worth noticing that the expenses of his journey to\r\nRome amounted to no less a sum than £102 3_s_. 3_d_., inclusive of the\r\npurchase and sale of a carriage, although no man was ever less prodigal\r\nof public money. Nor is there any record of any official objection to\r\nthis somewhat alarming outlay.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 the Pontifical Government, exercising its sway over some\r\n3,000,000 inhabitants of the Roman States, was in possession of no\r\ninconsiderable portion of the Italian peninsula, and presented the\r\nremarkable spectacle of a country jointly occupied by two foreign armies\r\nwhose task it was to protect the Pope against his own subjects. With\r\nthis object, 10,000 Austrians were stationed in the Ancona district, and\r\n10,000 French troops in Rome, the latter paying their own expenses, but\r\nthe former constituting a heavy charge upon the Holy Father with his\r\nembarrassed revenue and increasing deficit. The foreign policy of the\r\nGovernment was in the hands of Cardinal Antonelli, and not long after\r\nhis arrival Lyons was able to write that in spite of 'his peculiar\r\nposition' (unaccredited to the Government in Rome), and that in some\r\nquarters England is regarded as the natural enemy of the Papacy, I have\r\nfound that notwithstanding a very strong opinion to the contrary, at\r\nRome, as at most other places, one succeeds best by transacting one's\r\nbusiness in the most plain and straightforward manner, and through the\r\nmost direct channels. By acting on this principle and by being very\r\nquiet and unobtrusive, I think I have in part allayed the suspicions\r\nwhich are felt towards us always more or less at Rome, and I am\r\ncertainly on a better footing with Cardinal Antonelli than I had\r\nat all expected to be.\r\n\r\nThe business between His Majesty's Government and that of Rome was not\r\nof an overpowering nature, and was chiefly concerned with the proposed\r\nestablishment of regular diplomatic relations; with the alleged\r\nintention of the Papal Government to create a Hierarchy in Scotland, and\r\nwith the inconvenient zeal of ardent Protestants in the Papal dominions.\r\nAs regards the establishment of diplomatic relations it seems highly\r\ndoubtful whether the Papal Government really desired to see a new\r\nProtestant Mission at Rome: Cardinal Antonelli disclaimed any intention\r\nof creating Roman Catholic Bishops in Scotland, but the religious\r\nactivity of British subjects in the Pope's dominions was a constant\r\nsource of petty troubles. It must be admitted, however, that it was\r\nsingularly easy to fall out with the Papal Government. The importation\r\nof Bibles was forbidden, the distribution of tracts was punished with\r\nimprisonment; one man of English extraction was incarcerated for a\r\nlengthy period because, according to his own statements, he had not\r\ncommunicated with sufficient regularity; and there were over 600\r\npolitical prisoners in gaol at Rome at the same time.\r\n\r\nAs for the official relations between England and the Papal Government\r\nthey were friendly enough, and when the Crimean war broke out, feeling\r\nat the Vatican was strongly anti-Russian, for it was believed that\r\nwhereas the Roman Catholic Church had nothing to fear from Protestants\r\nand Mussulmans, the Greek schism was a real and threatening danger.\r\n\r\nThe following letter addressed to his brother, Captain Lyons, gives a\r\nnot uninteresting description of the life led in Rome by an unmarried\r\ndiplomatist without much private means, and incidentally shows the deep\r\naffection which he entertained for his family.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Rome, January 3rd, 1855.\r\n\r\n    You may imagine what a relief to me it was, after reading your\r\n    letter of the 18th, to see Admiral Dundas' arrival at Constantinople\r\n    announced in the Malta paper. Your letter of the 3rd is almost,\r\n    indeed I think quite, the most interesting I ever read. The only\r\n    drawback to the delight all these letters are to me, is that you\r\n    were still lying up. That I hope is over, and that you will be very\r\n    prudent about it. We have now a weekly post from Constantinople and\r\n    Malta, which is a great comfort. Mention all the details you can in\r\n    your letters about the siege and operations by sea and land. The\r\n    Malta papers bring nothing that can be depended upon. Besides the\r\n    intense interest, it is a great advantage to me diplomatically to\r\n    have good intelligence to communicate here, and is a great help to\r\n    getting information, which is useful to me, on Roman matters.\r\n    Details about Sir E. and yourself are always the most precious\r\n    things you can write, and they cannot be too numerous or too minute.\r\n\r\n    My _ménage_ consists of two men. I am obliged to have two, in order\r\n    not to have to open the door myself, if I send one out. I have a\r\n    good-sized sitting room, much better furnished than most Roman\r\n    Lodgings, a second sitting room, which serves as Anteroom, and\r\n    Breakfast Room, good Bedroom and a Dressing Room. I have very little\r\n    sun, which I think an advantage, though in general it is thought the\r\n    greatest of disadvantages--I breakfast at home, and dine with some\r\n    of the other Diplomatists at a little quiet Table d'Hôte, where\r\n    there is a very good dinner. In winter I dine out three or four\r\n    times a week, and always spend the evening in society. I never do\r\n    anything at all in the way of hospitality. With the immense number\r\n    of English here, it would be impossible for me to get on, unless I\r\n    made this rule. In summer I had some men occasionally to play at\r\n    Whist, all of course Foreigners. I have taken my present lodging to\r\n    the end of June. My hope is to go to England for two or three months\r\n    about that time. I pay between 14 and £15 sterling a month for my\r\n    apartment. It is in a capital situation--and a second floor. It is\r\n    an admirable country for long rides, but very bad for short ones.\r\n    The pavement of the Town is so slippery that it is dangerous to ride\r\n    over it--most of the gates are at a very great distance, and after\r\n    you pass them, you have a mile or two of stone wall, before you get\r\n    out into the open country--which is beautiful and excellent for\r\n    riding. The result is that I never do ride. Being almost the only\r\n    Englishman here who has anything to do, beyond sight seeing and\r\n    amusement, my hours do not suit my Countrymen. My great friend is a\r\n    Count Gozze, Austrian Secretary of Legation. He is an old Dresden\r\n    friend of mine. Rome is a very rainy place, which obliges me often\r\n    to hire a carriage to go out in the evening. The hired carriages are\r\n    good, but dear, about nine shillings for an evening. Lord Walpole is\r\n    here--no one else I think that you know. I have scribbled all this\r\n    because you ask me, and because little details about the writer (if\r\n    one really cares for him) are generally the most interesting parts\r\n    of letters, written where there are no great events going on. You\r\n    would think me oldwomanish if I mentioned half my anxieties about\r\n    you and my Father.\r\n\r\nA few months later, the brother, Captain Lyons, an exceptionally\r\npromising and gallant naval officer, died of wounds received before\r\nSebastopol.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 promotion came in the shape of the secretaryship of Legation at\r\nFlorence, but he continued to be employed in Rome, and stood\r\ntwenty-second on a list of twenty-four secretaries of Legation. His\r\nprospects of further advance did not appear reassuring, and in March\r\n1857, he writes to his father (now a peer), 'My chance at present seems\r\nto rest almost entirely on Lord Clarendon's disposition to give\r\npractical effect to the good opinion he expresses of me. I should trust\r\nwith more confidence to that, if he had not promoted six secretaries of\r\nLegation before me during my residence here, and afterwards offered me\r\nas promotion the post of Secretary of Legation at Florence. Had it not\r\nbeen for your visit to England at the critical moment, I should now have\r\nbeen no more than simple Secretary of Legation, doing nothing at\r\nFlorence.'\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1857, Lord Normanby, Minister at Florence, having gone\r\non leave, Lyons was sent to take his place, and, instead of having\r\nnothing to do, found himself at once involved in one of those trivial\r\nquestions which so deeply exercised the diplomacy of a former\r\ngeneration, but which are now of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the year the Pope had paid a visit to Tuscany, and during his\r\nstay at Florence a banquet was held in his honour, to which the members\r\nof the diplomatic corps were invited. Much to their indignation they\r\nwere not accommodated at the Tavola di Stato or Sovereign Table, where\r\nHis Holiness was seated, and Lord Normanby, the British Minister, a\r\nK.G., Ex-Viceroy, and social magnate, considered that an apology was\r\ndue from the Tuscan Government. Unfortunately for Lord Normanby, his\r\ncolleagues, having previously agreed to support him, backed out of their\r\nundertaking, and the task of extracting an apology fell upon Lyons, for\r\nLord Normanby had departed uttering dark threats that he would not\r\nreturn unless the apology was forthcoming. The Foreign Office took up\r\nthe matter seriously, and for no less than three months an animated\r\ncontroversy was carried on, in the course of which 'The Tuscan\r\nauthorities showed themselves so thoroughly wrongheaded that every time\r\nthe subject was mentioned they said or did something which made it more\r\ndifficult for them to go back,' and Lord Clarendon administered to them\r\n'a severe rebuke.' Finally, whether owing to the severe rebuke or not,\r\nsome sort of expression of regret was obtained; the injured Lord Normanby\r\nreturned to his post, and Lyons resumed his duties at Rome. Whence he\r\nwrites on March 6, 1858:--\r\n\r\n    The question of Reforms in the Papal Administration, which was so\r\n    much agitated during the Pope's journey and immediately afterwards,\r\n    appears to be entirely forgotten. The repressive measures which have\r\n    been adopted in France since the attempt on the Emperor[1] would\r\n    seem to render it difficult for H.M. to urge other sovereigns to\r\n    Liberal reforms. The mode in which the intelligence of the attempt\r\n    was received at Rome was shocking. One can hardly say that any class\r\n    expressed horror: the lower people openly declared their regret that\r\n    the crime had not been successful, and the middle classes took\r\n    little pains to conceal that they shared this feeling. In fact the\r\n    policy which is supposed to be adopted by France of coquetting with\r\n    the Liberal Party, without doing anything serious in their favour,\r\n    has alienated the sympathies of this part of Italy.\r\n\r\nReforms of a simple character were evidently urgently needed in the\r\nPapal Administration, for just about this time a Canadian bishop and\r\nother British tourists were openly plundered on the main road between\r\nRome and Civita Vecchia.\r\n\r\nThe turning point in Lyons's fortunes may be said to have arrived when\r\nearly in March he received orders from Lord Malmesbury to proceed to\r\nNaples to inquire into the case of the _Cagliari_.\r\n\r\nThe _Cagliari_ was a mail steamer plying between Genoa, Sardinia and\r\nTunis, and on June 25, a number of Mazzinians who had taken passage in\r\nher seized the master and the crew, altered the course of the vessel,\r\nlanded at the Island of Ponza in Neapolitan territory, where they\r\nliberated three hundred political prisoners, and subsequently proceeded\r\nto Sapri, in the neighbourhood of Salerno. Here they again disembarked,\r\nexpecting the inhabitants to rise in their favour, but encountered a\r\nsuperior force of Neapolitan troops who killed or captured the whole\r\nparty, whilst the _Cagliari_ was seized by Neapolitan warships as\r\nshe was making her way ostensibly to Naples. Some weeks later it was\r\nascertained that amongst the prisoners in Naples were two English\r\nengineers, Watt and Park by name, and it was stated that these two men\r\nwere entirely ignorant of the conspiracy, and had been forced by the\r\nconspirators to work the engines under threats of being summarily\r\nshot if they refused. Under the circumstances, as was only natural,\r\napplication was made by the British Government that they should at least\r\nhave a fair trial, and that the acting Vice-Consul at Naples should be\r\npermitted to visit them in gaol.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic relations between England and the Neapolitan Government\r\nhaving been suspended for some years, Lord Clarendon wrote himself\r\ndirect to Signor Carafa, the Neapolitan Foreign Minister, in November,\r\nurging the necessity of dealing with the case in an equitable spirit,\r\nbut with incredible perverseness and stupidity the Neapolitan Government\r\ncontinued to refuse upon one pretext or another either to release the\r\nmen or to bring them to trial, or even to permit the Vice-Consul to\r\nvisit them. In March, 1858, Watt and Park were still in gaol, and had\r\nbeen subjected to such abominable treatment that the health of both\r\nwas completely broken down, and Watt had become partially insane. Under\r\nthese circumstances, a change of government having in the meanwhile\r\noccurred in England, Lord Malmesbury directed Lyons to proceed at once\r\nto Naples and inquire into the case. Although the whole question had\r\nbeen considerably complicated, partly owing to a note of Sir James\r\nHudson to the Sardinian Government having been unaccountably altered by\r\na member of his staff, and partly owing to a rooted belief on the part\r\nof high Neapolitan legal authorities that engineers were responsible for\r\na ship's course, the Lyons Mission soon bore fruit, and the two\r\nunfortunate Englishmen were both set free, nominally on bail, before the\r\nend of the month, it having become evident to every one that they were\r\nabsolutely innocent. But the Neapolitan Government was by no means out\r\nof its difficulties. It was pointed out that as two innocent men had\r\nbeen imprisoned for nine months, and treated with great barbarity during\r\nthe greater part of the time, they were entitled to an indemnity which\r\nwas fixed at £3000. Worse was to follow, for, egged on by the Sardinian\r\nGovernment, the British Government put forward a demand that the\r\n_Cagliari_ should be surrendered on the ground that its capture had\r\nbeen illegally effected. Both these demands were refused, and finally,\r\nin May, 1858, a special messenger was sent to Naples instructing Lyons\r\nto leave unless within ten days the Neapolitan Government consented to\r\naccept mediation, and stating that England would make common cause with\r\nSardinia under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe message could not have been an agreeable one to deliver, and what\r\nthe Neapolitan Government disliked more than anything else was the\r\nappearance of yielding to Sardinia. 'Ah! s'il n'y avait que l'Angleterre!'\r\nhad always been the expression used by Signor Carafa; but his Government\r\nhad placed itself hopelessly in the wrong, and Lyons was able to report\r\nthat the indemnity would be paid, and that the _Cagliari_ had been\r\nplaced 'at his disposal.' It was an additional satisfaction to him to\r\nadd that: 'Far from threatening, I did not even go so far as my\r\ninstructions warranted, for I did not say that His Majesty's Government\r\nproposed that the mediator should retire at the end of three months, nor\r\ndid I tell Signor Carafa that I was myself ordered to go back to Rome if\r\nthe mediation should be refused at the expiration of ten days.'\r\n\r\nIn spite of the unpleasant nature of this affair, Lyons contrived to\r\nremain on the very best of terms with the Neapolitan Ministers with whom\r\nhe had to deal, and Lord Malmesbury was so favourably impressed with his\r\ntact and skill that he at once appointed him Minister at Florence. His\r\nprofessional future was now assured; but far greater honours were in\r\nstore for him, for in November, 1858, came the offer of the Washington\r\nLegation, an offer which, with characteristic modesty, he accepted with\r\nconsiderable misgivings as to his competence. Nor could it be said that\r\nsuccess had arrived with unusual rapidity, for he was already forty-one.\r\n\r\nIn the same month he succeeded to the peerage on the death of his\r\nfather. His mother had died some years previously; his brother had\r\nperished in the Crimea, and the only remaining near relatives were his\r\ntwo sisters, one of whom was married to the Duke of Norfolk, and the\r\nother to a Bavarian gentleman, Baron von Würtzburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Napoleon III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON\r\n\r\n(1859-1860)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February, 1859, Lord Lyons, accompanied by some members of his staff\r\n(a novelty to one who hitherto had been obliged to work unaided) was\r\ndespatched to Washington in H.M.S. _Curaçoa_, and owing to the limited\r\ncoal capacity of that vessel, the voyage occupied no less than forty-two\r\ndays, a period which must have been singularly disagreeable to a man who\r\nin spite of some years' naval service always suffered from sea sickness.\r\nThe new Minister was received with marked courtesy by the U.S.\r\nauthorities, and presented his letter of credence on April 12, Mr.\r\nBuchanan being President at the time, and General Cass occupying the\r\nposition of Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Presidential message of the previous December had\r\ncontained some rather ominous passages with regard to the relations\r\nbetween England and the United States, the sentiments now expressed\r\nwere friendly in character and showed a disposition to settle pending\r\ndifficulties in an amicable spirit.\r\n\r\nThe first letter of importance addressed by Lord Lyons to Lord\r\nMalmesbury deals with the effect produced in the United States\r\nby the outbreak of war between France and Austria.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Washington, May 24, 1859.\r\n\r\n    I had intended to write a despatch respecting the effect produced\r\n    in the U.S. by the War in Europe, but we are so short of hands in\r\n    the Chancery, that it is as much as we have been able to do to get\r\n    through the regular matters of business which must be treated\r\n    officially. I can however give you in a very few words an account of\r\n    the state of feeling here, which is probably just what you would\r\n    have expected it to be.\r\n\r\n    The sympathies are all with France and against Austria, but they do\r\n    not seem very strong; one sentiment however does appear to be both\r\n    strong and universal--the desire to take advantage of the state of\r\n    things in Europe to carry out American Views on this side of the\r\n    Atlantic; in short to get hold of Mexico and Cuba. The present wish\r\n    of the President is, I think, both to be and to appear to be on the\r\n    best terms with us. He is careful to vindicate us, in the newspaper\r\n    which is his organ, against all imputation of insincerity in Central\r\n    American Affairs. The Departments are particularly attentive to all\r\n    the smaller matters I have to bring before them, and apparently\r\n    anxious to do what I ask. But here I am afraid the practical effect\r\n    of their goodwill is likely to end. The Government is so weak that I\r\n    do not think it would venture, even in a small matter, to do\r\n    anything for us which would expose it to the least unpopularity. I\r\n    feel my way cautiously, endeavouring to be very plain and firm upon\r\n    clear British Questions, and to avoid doubtful topics as much as\r\n    possible.\r\n\r\n    The immediate object of the President with regard to Mexico appears\r\n    to be to avoid the ridicule which would be heaped upon him if the\r\n    Government of Juarez were to fall immediately after the American\r\n    Cabinet had at last made up their mind to recognize it. Instructions\r\n    are, I am told, on the point of being sent to Mr. McLane to\r\n    negotiate a treaty with Mexico, partly, it is said, with the object\r\n    of giving Juarez a little moral support, partly perhaps to get so\r\n    advantageous a Treaty from him, as to engage public opinion here to\r\n    declare itself more strongly in favour of his being upheld by the\r\n    U.S. Whether Mr. McLane will be instructed (as Mr. Forsyth was) to\r\n    propose to purchase part of the Mexican territory, I am unable to\r\n    say.\r\n\r\n    I am very much obliged by your sending out Mr. Warre, and am\r\n    impatiently expecting him. It is absolutely necessary to have a good\r\n    man here to direct the Chancery; I think too this mission would be a\r\n    very good school for a young man who really wished to learn his\r\n    business, and I should welcome any one who was industrious, and\r\n    wrote a thoroughly good legible hand.\r\n\r\n    It is particularly desirable that the Staff should be complete,\r\n    because if the Minister is to have any knowledge of the Country and\r\n    people, it is indispensable that he should visit, from time to time,\r\n    the principal cities. This is not like a European State, in which\r\n    politics and business are centred in the Capital, and can be studied\r\n    more advantageously there than elsewhere. No political men make\r\n    Washington their principal residence, in fact they cannot do so, as\r\n    it sends no members to Congress, either to the Senate or the House\r\n    of Representatives. Commerce it has none. It is in fact little more\r\n    than a large village--and when Congress is not sitting it is a\r\n    deserted village.\r\n\r\nAnother letter dated May 30, shows that he was under no illusion as to\r\nthe feelings entertained by a large section of the American public,\r\nwhile fully conscious of the difficulties with which the United States\r\nGovernment, however well intentioned, was forced to contend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Malmesbury._\r\n\r\n    Washington, May 30, 1859.\r\n\r\n    You will anticipate from my private letter of the 24th my answer to\r\n    your inquiry as to what would be the animus of this Government if\r\n    England became involved in the present war.\r\n\r\n    The first notion both of Government and People would be to take\r\n    advantage of the circumstance to take their full swing upon this\r\n    side of the Atlantic, and especially so far as the people are\r\n    concerned to get hold of Cuba and Mexico. The wiser heads see\r\n    very distinctly the imprudence of fresh acquisitions of territory,\r\n    and the great danger to the Union of introducing large Bodies of\r\n    Citizens of Spanish and mixed Races. I believe this to be the\r\n    feeling of the present Administration, but no administration\r\n    disregards the popular cry.\r\n\r\n    So far as I can learn, the American acquisitiveness is directed\r\n    rather South than North, and is disposed to be content for the\r\n    present, with what is most easy to lay hold of. Except on the part\r\n    of the most rancorous of the Irish here there does not appear to\r\n    be much desire of exciting disturbances in Canada or any of our\r\n    Colonies.\r\n\r\n    I think that if we were engaged in war the Americans would be\r\n    (particularly with reference to neutral rights at sea) punctilious,\r\n    exacting and quarrelsome to a degree. There is hardly any amount of\r\n    violence to which a captain of an American man of war, if he were\r\n    clearly in superior force, might not be expected to resort, in order\r\n    to prevent American merchantmen being interfered with. And however\r\n    outrageous in itself and opposed to International Law the conduct of\r\n    the American officers might be, it would meet with enthusiastic\r\n    applause from the multitude, and consequently the Government would\r\n    not dare to disavow it. This admiration of bullying and violent\r\n    proceedings on their own side, which appears to be universal among\r\n    the populace here, and the want of firmness on the part of the\r\n    Government in withstanding it, seem to me to constitute some of the\r\n    greatest difficulties we should have to contend with in keeping at\r\n    peace with America when we were at war with other Powers.\r\n\r\n    I do not think the general sympathies of the Americans need be taken\r\n    much into the account. The violent feelings aroused at particular\r\n    conjunctures by the events of the war, or by special matters of\r\n    dispute, are what will sway the mob, and therefore control the\r\n    Government. The upper classes here have certainly in general a\r\n    strong sympathy with England; they are proud of her position in the\r\n    world, they are anxious for her good opinion, they admire her\r\n    political institutions, and are extremely discontented with those of\r\n    their own country. But the upper classes keep aloof from political\r\n    life, and have little influence in public affairs. The mass of the\r\n    Irish Emigrants appear to regard England with bitter hatred, their\r\n    numbers give them weight in elections, but their moral power is\r\n    small. I should hardly say that the Bulk of the American people are\r\n    hostile to the old country but I think they would rather enjoy\r\n    seeing us in difficulties. Those even who are most friendly like to\r\n    gratify their pride by the idea of our being reduced to straits and\r\n    of their coming to our rescue.\r\n\r\n    I conceive that the wish both of Government and people would certainly\r\n    at first be to remain neutral, and reap all the advantages to their\r\n    commerce which could not fail to result from that situation, and\r\n    their interest in remaining at peace with us is so apparent and so\r\n    immense, that it could not fail to tell for some time. But the\r\n    People are irritable, excitable, and have a great longing to play\r\n    the part of a first-rate power.\r\n\r\n    The Government would no doubt endeavour to maintain neutrality, but\r\n    it would follow public feeling, and probably become exacting,\r\n    captious, and (to use a term more expressive than classical)\r\n    'bumptious' to a very irritating extent. A great deal would depend\r\n    upon firmness on our side. If they thought they could attain their\r\n    ends by threats and bluster, there would be no limit to their\r\n    pretensions. Perhaps the best way to deal with them would be to\r\n    gratify their vanity by treating them in matters of form as great\r\n    people, being careful to communicate with them respecting our views\r\n    and intentions in something the same manner as if they were really a\r\n    considerable military power: to avoid interfering in matters in\r\n    which we are not sufficiently interested to make it worth while to\r\n    raise serious questions, and above all in matters directly affecting\r\n    British interests and British Rights to be clear and distinct in our\r\n    language, and firm and decided in our conduct, to convince them that\r\n    when we are in the right and in earnest, we are more unyielding, not\r\n    less so than formerly--in short to avoid as much as possible raising\r\n    questions with them, but not to give way upon those we raise.\r\n\r\n    I need not remind you that these are the crude ideas of a man who\r\n    has been only seven weeks in the country, and who has necessarily\r\n    passed them in a small, and at this season, almost deserted town,\r\n    which is merely the nominal Capital.\r\n\r\n    I am anxiously looking out for Mr. Warre, whose arrival you announce\r\n    that I may soon expect. It would add much to the efficiency of the\r\n    Mission, and be a great comfort to me to have an additional unpaid\r\n    attaché, provided he were industrious, desirous to improve, and\r\n    capable of writing a good hand.\r\n\r\nThe change of Government which took place in England during the summer\r\nsubstituted Lord John Russell for Lord Malmesbury at the Foreign Office,\r\nand following the example of his predecessor, Lord John desired to be\r\nsupplied with confidential information by private letters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, July 11, 1859.\r\n\r\n    At present the President and his Cabinet appear to desire both to\r\n    be, and to be thought by the Public to be on the best terms with us.\r\n    They are however so weak in Congress, that I doubt whether they\r\n    would venture to do anything for us which would be the least\r\n    unpopular. It is not therefore to be hoped that they will make any\r\n    effort to open to us the Coasting Trade, to extend the provisions of\r\n    the Reciprocity Treaty with Canada, to make a Copyright Convention,\r\n    or, in short, take any liberal course in commercial matters. Nor\r\n    indeed is it likely to be in their power to carry any measures\r\n    tending to put us on equal terms with themselves in these respects.\r\n    The Democratic spirit in this country appears to be all in favour\r\n    of Protection and Exclusive Privileges. Happily the interest of\r\n    the South is against a high Customs Tariff; and this checks the\r\n    Protectionist Tendencies of the Manufacturing North.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dallas will have communicated to you the Statement which has\r\n    been for months preparing here, of the views of this Government\r\n    respecting neutral rights. The Cabinet, I understand, hope that they\r\n    shall obtain great credit with the people for their efforts to\r\n    establish American views on this point. They are very anxious to\r\n    obtain our co-operation, and imagine, I think, that they may induce\r\n    us to claim now concessions to Neutrals which would result in being\r\n    a considerable restraint to our assertion for ourselves of\r\n    Belligerent rights if we should become involved in war.\r\n\r\n    I think that our Relations with the U.S. require more than ever--at\r\n    this moment--caution and firmness. Caution--to avoid raising\r\n    questions with them, without a positive necessity; firmness--to make\r\n    them feel that they cannot take advantage of the State of affairs in\r\n    Europe to obtain undue advantages in matters directly affecting\r\n    British Interests or British Rights. For my own part I endeavour to\r\n    speak firmly and distinctly upon all matters which fall within the\r\n    proper province of the British Minister in this country and to avoid\r\n    all doubtful topics.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Americans, both Government and People, are I think very much\r\n    pleased by attentions and civilities, and very prone to fancy\r\n    themselves slighted. This quality may be sometimes turned to good\r\n    account, and should certainly be borne in mind when it is necessary\r\n    to keep them in good humour.\r\n\r\nOne of the many questions which had for some time engaged the attention\r\nof the two Governments was the disputed ownership of the island of San\r\nJuan on the Pacific coast, and this case afforded an instance in which\r\nthe Government of the United States was hampered by an agent whom it was\r\nnot inclined to disavow. The culprit was a certain General Harney who\r\nin a high-handed manner occupied the island without authorization,\r\nand conducted himself in a generally offensive manner, but although\r\nPresident Buchanan was considerably embarrassed by his action, he was\r\ntoo much afraid of the press and the mob to order the withdrawal of\r\nthe troops. For some time there appeared to be a chance of an actual\r\ncollision, and Lord John Russell showed considerable irritation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Abergeldie, Sept. 21, 1859.\r\n\r\n    The affair of San Juan is very annoying. It is of the nature of the\r\n    U.S. citizens to push themselves where they have no right to go, and\r\n    it is of the nature of the U.S. Government not to venture to disavow\r\n    acts they cannot have the face to approve.\r\n\r\n    The best way perhaps would be that we should seize some other island\r\n    to which we have as little right as the Americans to San Juan. But\r\n    until we know the answer of the American Government to your note and\r\n    the proceedings of Governor Douglas, we can hardly give you\r\n    instructions.\r\n\r\n    If you could contrive a convention with the U.S. by which each Power\r\n    should occupy San Juan for three or six months, each to protect\r\n    person and property till the boundary question is settled, it will\r\n    be the best arrangement that can be made for the present.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the U.S. Government showed itself more reasonable\r\nthan had been expected: a superior officer, General Scott, was sent to\r\nsettle matters, Harney, to use Lord John Russell's expression, was 'left\r\nin the mud,' and after a joint occupation and protracted negotiations\r\nthe question of the ownership of San Juan was referred to the arbitration\r\nof the King of Prussia, who gave his award in favour of the United\r\nStates some years later.\r\n\r\nSan Juan, however, was but one amongst a multitude of questions\r\nrequiring solution, and the great difficulty which Lord Lyons had to\r\ncontend with was--to use his own words, 'The idea that, happen what may,\r\nEngland will never really declare war with this country has become so\r\ndeeply rooted that I am afraid nothing short of actual hostilities would\r\neradicate it.' One of these questions concerned the Slave Trade.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n    Dec 6, 1859.\r\n\r\n    You will see by my despatches of this date, that there is very\r\n    little prospect of any satisfactory result from our remonstrance\r\n    concerning the Slave Trade. Lamentable as it is, I am afraid the\r\n    President goes beyond public opinion already in the measures he\r\n    takes against it. In the South the rendering it legal has many\r\n    avowed advocates, and it is to be feared that some of the professed\r\n    Abolitionists of the North derive too much profit from dabbling\r\n    themselves in the trade to desire any efficient measures for its\r\n    suppression. The greater part of the vessels engaged in it seem to\r\n    be fitted out at New York. The state of feeling at this moment in\r\n    the South upon the whole question of slavery is shocking. The\r\n    Harper's Ferry affair seems to have excited Southern passions to an\r\n    indescribable degree. The dissolution of the Confederation is but\r\n    one of the measures which are loudly advocated. There are plans for\r\n    the re-enslavement of all the emancipated negroes and for the\r\n    purging the South of all whites suspected of Abolitionist\r\n    tendencies. The difficulty which we shall have in obtaining decent\r\n    treatment for coloured British subjects will be almost insuperable.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Another source of trouble between us and the Southern States may\r\n    arise from the measures which they are taking to drive out all\r\n    persons suspected of unorthodox notions on slavery, and the orthodox\r\n    notion seems to be that slavery is a divine institution. In many\r\n    parts of the South, Vigilance Committees are formed who turn people\r\n    out at a moment's notice, without any pretext even of law. If any\r\n    attempt is made to treat British subjects in this manner, I trust\r\n    you will approve of my encouraging the Consuls to insist upon the\r\n    law being observed in their case, and to resist any endeavour to\r\n    inflict banishment or any other penalty upon an Englishman, except\r\n    in due form of law. But it will require a great deal of prudence\r\n    and discretion to act in each case, for a fair trial is a thing\r\n    impossible in this country of election judges and partisan juries\r\n    when party feeling is excited, and any redress we may exact for the\r\n    wrong to England, will be too late for the individual in the hands\r\n    of Lynch Law Assassins.\r\n\r\n    The great hope is that the excitement is too violent to last, but\r\n    before it subsides, it may do incalculable harm to these states and\r\n    raise very painful and awkward questions for us.\r\n\r\nIf the hope expressed in the last paragraph was fallacious, the\r\nforebodings as to the possible tribulations of British subjects proved\r\nbefore long to be only too well founded.\r\n\r\nAsked by Lord John Russell for his opinion on the position of affairs in\r\nMexico, he points out _inter alia_, that--\r\n\r\n    The actual annexation of Mexico to this Confederation raises\r\n    immediately one of those questions between the Northern and Southern\r\n    States which have already gone a great way to dissolve the Union\r\n    altogether. The Southern States desire the addition of territory\r\n    _south_, with a view to extending slavery and adding to the\r\n    Pro-Slavery votes in the U.S. Senate. To this the North is\r\n    conscientiously opposed on religious grounds, to say nothing of the\r\n    indignation it feels at the notion of its own vast superiority in\r\n    wealth and population being swamped in the Senate. Even now, since\r\n    every State sends equally two senators, whatever may be its\r\n    population, the North has not the influence it ought to have in the\r\n    Senate which is the more important branch of the Legislature. As\r\n    the religious sentiment in the North approaches very nearly to\r\n    fanaticism, and as the Southern feeling on the point has become\r\n    furious passion, there is little chance of their coming to an\r\n    agreement upon a matter which calls these feelings into play. In\r\n    this particular question the South have on their side the national\r\n    vanity which seems always childishly gratified by any addition to\r\n    the already enormous extent of the territory. In the meantime the\r\n    course of events seems to be bringing about the gradual annexation\r\n    of Mexico. The Mexicans in the northern part of their country have\r\n    fallen to that point, that they can neither maintain order on the\r\n    frontier nor hold their own against the savage Indians within it.\r\n    They will (to use an American expression) be 'squatted out' of their\r\n    country whenever and wherever any considerable number of the more\r\n    energetic race choose to settle. But this is a very different thing\r\n    from the sudden incorporation of a vast territory and of a large\r\n    population totally different in race, language, religion and\r\n    feeling, and (so far as the experiment has been tried) utterly\r\n    incapable of maintaining order among themselves under the U.S.\r\n    system of government. All the wiser and more conservative\r\n    politicians in this country deprecate as an unmitigated evil the\r\n    sudden annexation of Mexico; nor are such men willing to undertake\r\n    a protectorate of Mexico. This they say would be an enormous\r\n    innovation upon their whole political system which has never\r\n    admitted of any other connexion than that of perfectly equal\r\n    sovereign states, bound by a Federal tie on terms the same for all.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential Message of December, 1859, was noticeable for an\r\nearnest appeal to the North and South to cultivate feelings of mutual\r\nforbearance.\r\n\r\nThe message also made clear the policy of the President towards Mexico;\r\nin accordance with the principles of the Monroe doctrine, European\r\nintervention in that country was repudiated, and American intervention\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nA passage referring to San Juan while obviously intended to exculpate\r\nGeneral Harney, paid a handsome tribute to the moderation and discretion\r\nshown by the British Admiral (Baynes) commanding on the Pacific\r\nstation; and the President in conversation expressed the hope that the\r\napproaching close of his administration would leave 'a clear score' with\r\nEngland. No doubt President Buchanan was sincere in his expressions,\r\nbut unfortunately, early in 1860, signs were not wanting, that in the\r\ndistracted state of the country owing to the rising passions between\r\nNorth and South, many people believed that a foreign war would be the\r\nbest means of promoting unity, nor was there much doubt as to which\r\nforeign country would be selected for the experiment.\r\n\r\nWashington has already been disrespectfully alluded to as little better\r\nthan a large village, and as bearing little resemblance to an ordinary\r\ncapital, but it is evident that Lord Lyons found plenty of enjoyment\r\nthere. He was on excellent terms personally with the State officials and\r\nhis diplomatic colleagues; liked the members of his staff, and above all\r\nrejoiced in the fact that there was plenty of work to be done--a good\r\ndeal more, indeed, than the ordinary person would have approved of. One\r\nof his few complaints is that he is much beset by the inventors of\r\nimplements of war. 'I have not the slightest knowledge practical or\r\ntheoretical respecting implements of war, and should consequently never\r\nbe justified in recommending one more than another to the authorities at\r\nhome. I absolutely decline to see, touch, or have brought into my house\r\nany explosive material, I should not feel easy at having even in a\r\ngarret such a box as you (the Consul at New York) have received for Her\r\nMajesty. I should be inclined to ask for authority from England to sink\r\nit in the Atlantic Ocean.'\r\n\r\n'I am getting on tolerably well here, I hope, on the whole, and have no\r\ncomplaints to make of the Americans,' he admits in letters to other\r\ncorrespondents, and adds: 'I am afraid marriage is better never than\r\nlate. The American women are undoubtedly very pretty, but my heart is\r\ntoo old and too callous to be wounded by their charms. I am not going to\r\nbe married either to the fascinating accomplished niece of the\r\nPresident, or to the widow of a late Foreign Minister, or to any other\r\nmaiden or relict to whom I am given by the newspapers.'\r\n\r\nThese sentiments sound rather rash even at the age of forty-two, but\r\nthey remained unchanged. It would be incorrect to describe him as a\r\nmisogynist, but he successfully withstood all attempts to marry him.\r\nIn after years, an exalted personage (neither Queen Victoria nor the\r\nEmpress Eugenie) was so insistent upon the advisability of his espousing\r\none of her ladies-in-waiting, that she eventually couched her proposal\r\nin the form of an ultimatum. Lord Lyons asked for and obtained a delay\r\nof twenty-four hours, and decided upon consideration to refuse. In view\r\nof an event which occurred not long afterwards the decision proved to be\r\na prudent one, and probably confirmed him in the suspicions which he\r\nappeared to entertain of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nIt had been decided that the Prince of Wales should make a tour in\r\nCanada in the summer of 1860, and the Duke of Newcastle, at that time\r\nColonial Secretary, consulted Lord Lyons as to the advisability of\r\nH.R.H. paying a visit to America. The latter, upon consideration,\r\npronounced in favour of it. He did not arrive at this decision without\r\nsome hesitation. It was feared by persons of experience that the\r\ndisaffected Irish in New York and elsewhere might make themselves\r\ndisagreeable; the Prince's time was limited, and he would obviously\r\nbe unable to make an extended tour, and so might involuntarily cause\r\noffence, whilst it was highly probable that the necessity for preserving\r\na strictly non-official character might also give rise to difficulties.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, President Buchanan extended an invitation in such\r\ncordial terms that it would have been ungracious to decline.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons joined the Prince of Wales in Canada in August, and the tour\r\nmust have been an agreeable change even to a person of his sedentary\r\ninclinations. Since his arrival at Washington, fifteen months before, he\r\nhad never slept or been six miles outside the town. 'Whenever,' he\r\nexplains to a friend, 'I have planned a journey, I have been stopped by\r\ninvasions of islands in the Pacific or some other \"difficulty\" as a\r\ndispute is called here.' It may be surmised, however, that such\r\nobstacles were much less objectionable to him than they would have been\r\nto any one else; he hated travel, openly avowed that he loathed\r\nsight-seeing, and welcomed the opportunity of 'getting Niagara and the\r\nLakes done this way; it will be a good thing over.'\r\n\r\nIt was eventually decided that the Prince's visit to the States should\r\ntake place in September, and the announcement was not only received\r\nwith unbounded satisfaction, but caused prodigious excitement. 'The\r\nPresident was moved from the usual staid solemnity of his demeanour by\r\nhis gratification at receiving an answer from Her Majesty written with\r\nher own hand. At the close of our interview he hurried off with it in\r\ngreat delight (no doubt to show it to his niece) saying: \"It is indeed\r\nsomething to have an autograph letter from Queen Victoria!\"[2] Nor was\r\nthe President's gratification confined to the family circle, for he\r\nasked and obtained permission to publish the royal letter which had\r\nafforded so much satisfaction. As soon as the news became known\r\ninvitations of every kind at once began to pour in from all quarters,\r\nand offerings of the most varied description made their appearance at\r\nthe Legation, which included such objects as equestrian sugar statues of\r\nH.R.H., pots of ointment for the Queen, books of sermons for \"Baron\r\nRenfrew,\" and a set of plates for the \"Prince of Whales.\" Innumerable\r\nrequests arrived too for interviews, autographs, and mementos, amongst\r\nwhich may be cited an application for a photograph from a citizen of\r\nLowell \"for his virgin wife.\"'\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, unfortunately necessary to decline the invitations,\r\nfor the itinerary had been settled beforehand, and it had been wisely\r\ndecided that the Prince should never stay with any private individual,\r\nbut always be lodged at an hotel at his own expense, that he should\r\nrefuse to receive addresses and deputations, and should neither hear nor\r\nmake public speeches. It was also considered desirable that receptions\r\nof British subjects should not be encouraged, and that he should not\r\nattend any demonstration of his fellow-countrymen so as not to excite\r\nany feeling of jealousy.\r\n\r\nAs for the gifts which were proffered in great profusion, they were\r\nregretfully declined in accordance with the usual practice of the Royal\r\nFamily.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the nominally private character of the Prince of Wales's\r\ntour in the United States, most careful arrangements were found to be\r\nnecessary wherever he made a stay. At New York, in particular, which\r\ncity appears to be, beyond all others, interested in Royal personages,\r\nthe programme could hardly have been of a more elaborate nature had an\r\nEmperor been visiting an Imperial Sire and Brother; even the ladies with\r\nwhom H.R.H. was expected to dance, having been selected long in advance.\r\nThe chief difficulty in New York and elsewhere seems to have been the\r\nprohibition of speeches at banquets. The Americans, overflowing with\r\nhospitable enthusiasm, were only too anxious to display their friendship\r\nin public utterances, but the British Government had wisely decided that\r\nnineteen was too early an age at which to begin making speeches in a\r\nforeign country, and the rule of silence was rigidly adhered to.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales's tour, although necessarily brief, included,\r\nbesides Washington, some of the principal cities in the States, and\r\njudging from the contemporary correspondence, was attended by singularly\r\nfew untoward incidents, proving, in fact, successful beyond expectation.\r\n\r\nThe happy effect produced by this visit was described in an official\r\ndespatch, and private letters corroborate the favourable impression\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\n'I have more completely realized, as the Americans say, the wonderful\r\nsuccess of the Prince of Wales's tour than I did when it was in\r\nprogress. I have now had time to talk quietly about it with men\r\nwhose opinion is worth having, and also to compare newspapers of various\r\nshades of politics. I am glad to see that the incognito and other\r\nrestrictions maintained are represented as a peculiar compliment to\r\nthe Americans as showing a desire to associate with them on more equal\r\nterms than would be possible with subjects.'[3]\r\n\r\n'The Prince of Wales's tour in the U.S. went off completely to the\r\nsatisfaction of all parties from the beginning to the end. It was rather\r\nhard work for me, as he never went out without me, nor I without him,\r\nand I had quantities of letters to write and people to see and keep in\r\ngood humour. Nevertheless H.R.H. himself and all the people with him\r\nwere so agreeable, that on the whole I enjoyed the tour very much while\r\nit was going on. I look back to it with unmixed satisfaction.'[4]\r\n\r\nMuch of the success, although he was too modest to allude to it, was\r\nprobably due to his own carefulness and forethought.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [2] Lord Lyons to Lord J.

The change is very great even since I wrote\r\n    to you on the 29th October. Our friends are apparently going ahead\r\n    on the road to ruin with their characteristic speed and energy.\r\n\r\n    The President (Buchanan) is harassed beyond measure. It is a very\r\n    unfortunate moment for our negotiations, but the present state of\r\n    things makes me more than ever anxious to get the San Juan question\r\n    safely landed beyond the reach of the incoming administration.\r\n\r\nThe approaching rule of Lincoln entailed the disquieting probability of\r\nthe appointment of Mr. Seward as Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Jan. 7, 1861.\r\n\r\n    It is considered almost certain that Mr. Seward is to be Mr.\r\n    Lincoln's Secretary of State. This will be regarded as a defiance\r\n    of the South, unless (as is expected) Mr. Seward comes out with a\r\n    conciliatory speech in the Senate. With regard to Great Britain, I\r\n    cannot help fearing that he will be a dangerous Foreign Minister.\r\n    His view of the relations between the United States and Great\r\n    Britain has always been that they are a good material to make\r\n    political capital of. He thinks at all events that they may be\r\n    safely played with without any risk of bringing on a war. He has\r\n    even to me avowed his belief that England will never go to war with\r\n    the United States. He has generally taken up any cry against us, but\r\n    this he says he has done from friendship, to prevent the other\r\n    Party's appropriating it and doing more harm with it than he has\r\n    done. The temptation will be great for Lincoln's party, if they be\r\n    not actually engaged in a civil war, to endeavour to divert the\r\n    public excitement to a foreign quarrel. I do not think Mr. Seward\r\n    would contemplate actually going to war with us, but he would be\r\n    well disposed to play the old game of seeking popularity here by\r\n    displaying violence towards us. I don't think it will be so good a\r\n    game for him as it used to be, even supposing we give him an\r\n    apparent triumph, but I think he is likely to play it.\r\n\r\n    This makes me more than ever anxious to settle the San Juan\r\n    question.\r\n\r\nThe forebodings came true. Mr. Seward, a lawyer, who had aimed at the\r\nPresidency himself, became Secretary of State, and caused the British\r\nGovernment and the diplomatists at Washington many uncomfortable\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, March 26, 1861.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Seward came to me on the evening of the 20th ultimo, and asked\r\n    me to let him speak to me very confidentially....\r\n\r\n    Mr. Seward observed that he considered it all important to ward off\r\n    a crisis during the next three months; that he had good hopes that\r\n    if this could be effected a counter revolution would take place in\r\n    the South; that he hoped and believed it would begin in the most\r\n    distant State, Texas, where indeed he saw symptoms of it already. It\r\n    might be necessary towards producing this effect to make the\r\n    Southern States feel uncomfortable in their present condition by\r\n    interrupting their commerce. It was however most important that the\r\n    new Confederacy should not in the mean time be recognized by any\r\n    Foreign Power.\r\n\r\n    I said that certainly the feelings as well as the interests of Great\r\n    Britain would render H.M.'s Government most desirous to avoid any\r\n    step which could prolong the quarrel between North and South, or be\r\n    an obstacle to a cordial and speedy reunion between them if that\r\n    were possible. Still I said, if the U.S. determined to stop by force\r\n    so important a commerce as that of Great Britain with the\r\n    cotton-growing States, I could not answer for what might happen.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Seward asked whether England would not be content to get cotton\r\n    through the Northern Ports, to which it could be sent by land.\r\n\r\n    I answered that cotton although by far the most important article of\r\n    the Trade was not the only point to be considered. It was however a\r\n    matter of the greatest consequence to England to procure cheap\r\n    cotton. If a considerable rise were to take place in the price of\r\n    cotton, and British ships were to be at the same time excluded from\r\n    the Southern Ports, an immense pressure would be put upon H.M.'s\r\n    Government to use all the means in their power to open those Ports.\r\n    If H.M.'s Government felt it to be their duty to do so, they would\r\n    naturally endeavour to effect their object in a manner as consistent\r\n    as possible first with, their friendly feelings towards both\r\n    Sections of this Country, and secondly with the recognized\r\n    principles of International Law. As regards the latter point in\r\n    particular, it certainly appeared that the most simple, if not the\r\n    only way, would be to recognize the Southern Confederacy. I said a\r\n    good deal about my hopes that Mr. Seward would never let things come\r\n    to this, with which it is unnecessary to trouble you.\r\n\r\n    I thought that Mr. Seward, although he did not give up the point,\r\n    listened with complacency to my arguments against interference with\r\n    Foreign Commerce. He said more than once that he should like to take\r\n    me to the President to discuss the subject with him. The conclusion\r\n    I came to was that the questions of a forcible collection of the\r\n    duties in the Southern Ports, and of a blockade of those Ports were\r\n    under discussion in the Cabinet, but that Mr. Seward was himself\r\n    opposed to those measures, and had good hopes that his opinion would\r\n    prevail.\r\n\r\n    It would appear however that a change took place in the interval\r\n    between this conversation and yesterday. Mr. Seward, the principal\r\n    Members of the Cabinet, the Russian Minister, M. de Stoeckl, and the\r\n    French Minister, Mons. Mercier, with some other people dined with\r\n    me. After dinner, Mr. Seward entered into an animated conversation\r\n    with my French and Russian Colleagues, and signed to me to join\r\n    them. When I came up I found him asking M. Mercier to give him a\r\n    copy of his Instructions to the French Consuls in the Southern\r\n    States. M. Mercier made some excuse for refusing, but said that what\r\n    the instructions amounted to was that the Consuls were to do their\r\n    best to protect French Commerce 'sans sortir de la plus stricte\r\n    neutralité.' Mr. Seward then asked me to give him a copy of my\r\n    instructions to H.M.'s Consuls. I, of course, declined to do so, but\r\n    I told him that the purport of them was that the Consuls were to\r\n    regard questions from a commercial not a political point of view,\r\n    that they were to do all they could to favour the continuance of\r\n    peaceful commerce short of performing an act of recognition without\r\n    the orders of Her Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Henry Seward.\r\n\r\nLondon: Edward Arnold]\r\n\r\n    Mr. Seward then alluded to the Peruvian Papers, and speaking as he\r\n    had done all along very loud, said to my French and Russian\r\n    Colleagues and me, 'I have formed my opinion on that matter, and I\r\n    may as well tell it to you now as at any other time. I differ with\r\n    my Predecessor as to _de facto_ Authorities. If one of your Ships\r\n    comes out of a Southern Port without the Papers required by the laws\r\n    of the U.S., and is seized by one of our Cruisers and carried into\r\n    New York and confiscated, we shall not make any compensation.' My\r\n    Russian Colleague, M. de Stoeckl, argued the question with Mr.\r\n    Seward very good humouredly and very ably. Upon his saying that a\r\n    Blockade to be respected must be effective, Mr. Seward replied that\r\n    it was not a blockade that would be established; that the U.S.\r\n    Cruisers would be stationed off the Southern Coast to collect\r\n    duties, and enforce penalties for the infraction of the U.S. Customs\r\n    Laws. Mr. Seward then appealed to me. I said that it was really a\r\n    matter so very serious that I was unwilling to discuss it; that his\r\n    plan seemed to me to amount in fact to a paper blockade of the\r\n    enormous extent of coast comprised in the Seceding States; that the\r\n    calling it an enforcement of the Revenue Laws appeared to me to\r\n    increase the gravity of the measure, for it placed Foreign Powers in\r\n    the Dilemma of recognizing the Southern Confederation, or of\r\n    submitting to the interruption of their Commerce.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Seward then went off into a defiance of Foreign Nations, in a\r\n    style of braggadocio which was formerly not uncommon with him, but\r\n    which I had not heard before from him since he had been in office.\r\n    Finding he was getting more and more violent and noisy, and saying\r\n    things which it would be more convenient for me not to have heard, I\r\n    took a natural opportunity of turning, as host, to speak to some of\r\n    the ladies in the room.\r\n\r\n    M. de Stoeckl and M. Mercier inferred, as I do, that within the last\r\n    two days the opinion of the more violent party in the Cabinet had\r\n    prevailed, at all events for the moment, and that there is a danger\r\n    that an interference with Foreign Trade may take place at any\r\n    moment. I hope that it may still be prevented by the fear of its\r\n    producing a recognition of the Southern Confederacy. But I am afraid\r\n    we must be prepared for it.\r\n\r\n    It may perhaps be well, with a view to the effect on this\r\n    Government, that the Commissioners who are on their way to Europe\r\n    from the Southern States should not meet with too strong a rebuff in\r\n    England or in France. Such a rebuff would be a great encouragement\r\n    to violent measures. In fact, notwithstanding my contradictions, the\r\n    Senate, and indeed, I fear, the President is not uninfluenced by the\r\n    bold assertions made by some Members of the violent Party that they\r\n    have positive assurances from Y.L. and other Members of H.M.'s\r\n    Government that _under no circumstances whatever_ will Great\r\n    Britain recognize the independence of the South.\r\n\r\n    M. Mercier thinks it advisable that he and I should have a\r\n    discretionary Power to recognize the South. This seems to me to be\r\n    going too fast. I should feel a good deal embarrassed by having such\r\n    a power in my pocket, unless the contingency in which it was to be\r\n    used should be most clearly stated. What does appear to be of\r\n    extreme importance is that England and France should act in concert.\r\n\r\nLincoln had been inaugurated as President in March, and in the following\r\nmonth the long-awaited collision occurred at Charleston, when the\r\nConfederates opened fire upon and captured Fort Sumter. The forts in\r\nCharleston harbour had by common consent become the test case, and the\r\ncapture of Fort Sumter signalized the fact that a population of little\r\nover 5 millions of white men had had the audacity to challenge over 22\r\nmillions of their fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nCharleston, by the way, besides its importance in American history,\r\nseems to have been a place where slavery was a very thorough-going\r\ninstitution, judging from the following advertisement in the _Mercury_,\r\nof March 25th, 1861.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    NOTICE. TEN DOLLARS REWARD.\r\n\r\n    Runaway on Friday night, March 23rd, my woman 'Silvey,' about forty\r\n    years of age, of a light brown complexion, and has spots on her\r\n    face as if done with powder, and limps a little, and speaks very low\r\n    when spoken to. She formerly belonged to the Rev. Mr. Keith, and of\r\n    late to Johnson the tailor, in King Street, near George Street. When\r\n    she left she had a chain around her ankles to keep her from going\r\n    off, but she went anyhow. Apply to P. Buckheit, north-west corner of\r\n    Line and Meeting Streets.\r\n\r\nMr. W. H. Russell, the well-known correspondent, was in Charleston a few\r\ndays after the fall of Fort Sumter, and wrote as follows:----\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Charleston, April 19, 1861.\r\n\r\n    I arrived here the night before last _viâ_ Baltimore, Norfolk and\r\n    Wilmington. North Carolina was in revolt--that is, there was no\r\n    particular form of authority to rebel against, but the shadowy\r\n    abstractions in lieu of it were treated with deserved contempt by\r\n    the 'citizens,' who with flint muskets and quaint uniforms were\r\n    ready at the various stations to seize on anything, particularly\r\n    whisky, which it occurred to them to fancy. At Wilmington I sent a\r\n    message to the electric telegraph office for transmission to New\r\n    York, but the 'citizens' of the Vigilance Committee refused to\r\n    permit the message to be transmitted and were preparing to wait upon\r\n    me with a view of asking me what were my general views on the state\r\n    of the world, when I informed them peremptorily that I must decline\r\n    to hold any intercourse with them which I the more objected to do in\r\n    that they were highly elated and excited by the news from Sumter. I\r\n    went over the works with General Beauregard: the military injury\r\n    done to Sumter is very trifling, but Anderson's defence, negative as\r\n    it was, must be regarded as exceedingly creditable to him.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    In a week's time the place will be a hard nut to crack. One thing\r\n    is certain: nothing on earth will induce the people to return to the\r\n    Union. I believe firmly their present intention is to march upon\r\n    Washington, if it were merely as a diversion to carry the war away\r\n    from their interior.\r\n\r\nWar having now actually broken out, the question of the blockade of the\r\nSouthern ports became all important for England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, April 15, 1861.\r\n\r\n    I am getting very uneasy about the intention of the Government with\r\n    regard to stopping intercourse with Southern Ports. Now that war has\r\n    begun it seems difficult to suppose that they will abstain from\r\n    taking advantage of their one great superiority, which is their\r\n    navy. I suppose that a regular blockade would be less objectionable\r\n    than any such measures as closing the Southern Ports as Ports of\r\n    entry, or attempting to collect duties for the U.S. by ships\r\n    stationed off them. The rules of a blockade are to a great extent\r\n    determined and known, and our ships could at all events resort to\r\n    any Ports before which the U.S. did not establish a regular\r\n    effective blockade. But if the U.S. are to be permitted to seize any\r\n    ship of ours wherever they can find her within their jurisdiction on\r\n    the plea that by going to a Southern port she has violated the U.S.\r\n    custom laws, our commerce will be exposed to vexations beyond\r\n    bearing, and all kinds of new and doubtful questions will be raised.\r\n    In fact, this, it seems to me, would be a paper blockade of the\r\n    worst kind. It would certainly justify Great Britain and France in\r\n    recognizing the Southern Confederacy and sending their fleets to\r\n    force the U.S. to treat British and French vessels as neutrals in\r\n    conformity with the law of nations.\r\n\r\n    Just as Mr. Seward was confident that he had prevailed in the\r\n    Cabinet, the President and the violent party suddenly threw over his\r\n    policy. Having determined not to resign, he pretends to be pleased,\r\n    and one of his colleagues says of him that in order to make up for\r\n    previous lukewarmness he is now the fiercest of the lot. It is a\r\n    great inconvenience to have him as the organ of communication from\r\n    the U.S. Government. Repeated failures have not convinced him that\r\n    he is not sure to carry his point with the President and the\r\n    Cabinet. He is therefore apt to announce as the fixed intentions\r\n    of his Government what is in reality no more than a measure which he\r\n    himself supports.\r\n\r\n    I am in constant apprehension of some foolish and violent proceeding\r\n    of the Government with regard to Foreign Powers. Neither the\r\n    President nor any man in the Cabinet has a knowledge of Foreign\r\n    Affairs; they have consequently all the overweening confidence in\r\n    their own strength which popular oratory has made common in this\r\n    country. I believe the best chance of keeping them within bounds\r\n    will be to be very firm with them, particularly at first, and to act\r\n    in concert with France, if that be possible.\r\n\r\n    As I have mentioned in my despatches, information coming from the\r\n    Southern Commissioners sent to negotiate with the Government here,\r\n    it may be as well to mention that they did not seek any intercourse\r\n    with me, and that I never had any communication with them, direct or\r\n    otherwise. I do not know that I should have thought it necessary to\r\n    refuse to communicate with them, if it had been proposed to me, but\r\n    the fact is as I have just said.\r\n\r\nThe policy of acting in conjunction with France was adopted with\r\nconsiderable success, as will appear later, but hitherto the British\r\nGovernment had not given any very clear lead, Lord John Russell\r\ncontenting himself with the view that he relied upon 'the wisdom,\r\npatience, and prudence of the British Minister to steer safely through\r\nthe danger of the crisis.' It was absolutely necessary, however, to deal\r\nwith the Blockade Question, and the Cabinet consulted the Law Officers\r\nof the Crown, with the result that the Southern States were recognized\r\nas belligerents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord John Russell to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, May 6, 1861.\r\n\r\n    I cannot give you any official instructions by this mail, but the\r\n    Law Officers are of opinion that we must consider the Civil War\r\n    in America as regular war--_justum bellum_--and apply to it all\r\n    the rules respecting blockade, letters of Marque which belong to\r\n    neutrals during a war. They think moreover it would be very\r\n    desirable if both parties would agree to accept the Declaration of\r\n    Paris regarding the flag covering the goods and the prohibition of\r\n    privateers.\r\n\r\n    You will of course inform our naval officers that they must conform\r\n    to the rules respecting Blockade, of which they are I believe in\r\n    possession. The matter is very serious and very unfortunate.\r\n\r\nAn important conversation took place on May 17, between Lord J. Russell\r\nand Mr. Adams, the new American Minister in London, in which the latter\r\nwent so far as to state that Lord John Russell's language to his\r\npredecessor, Mr. Dallas, had been construed in an unfavourable light in\r\nthe United States, and that he was afraid that his own mission might\r\ncome to an end unless the unfavourable impression was corrected. He\r\nfurther complained of the recognition of the South as a belligerent.\r\nLord John Russell in reply declined to give an undertaking that, apart\r\nfrom belligerent rights, England would never recognize the Southern\r\nStates, but he endeavoured to make it clear that, if anything, popular\r\nsympathy in England was with the North, and that H.M. Government were\r\nonly desirous of maintaining a strict neutrality. Any one reading the\r\ncorrespondence of the period cannot fail to realize that Lord John\r\nRussell was perfectly sincere in his expressed wish to preserve perfect\r\nimpartiality, in spite of the querulous and acrimonious tone which\r\noccasionally characterized his communications.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons, on his side, was only too anxious to avoid the slightest\r\nsemblance of anything which might cause offence to the United States\r\nGovernment. He was constantly impressing upon the various Consuls that,\r\nstrict neutrality being the policy of H.M. Government, they must not be\r\nled away by their sympathies, but confine themselves to obeying orders.\r\nHe vetoed the requests for warships, which they occasionally clamoured\r\nfor, in the traditional consular spirit, and urged caution upon the\r\nBritish naval Commanders and the Canadian authorities. Fortunately, both\r\nAdmiral Milne and Sir Edmund Head, the Governor-General of Canada, were\r\nprudent and tactful men, who ably co-operated with him. With both of\r\nthese he corresponded confidentially, and made no secret of the\r\napprehensions which he entertained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Sir E. Head._\r\n\r\n    Washington, May 22, 1861.\r\n\r\n    You will perhaps consider the notion that the U.S. should at this\r\n    moment provoke a war with a great Power as preposterous, and _à\r\n    priori_ it must seem incredible to any one. Nevertheless I am\r\n    so seriously alarmed by what I see passing around me here and\r\n    especially by the conduct of the Cabinet that I have thought it my\r\n    duty to call the attention of our Government to the danger which I\r\n    conceive to exist. To avert it is the main object of all I do here.\r\n    I am afraid however that things are coming to a point at which my\r\n    diplomacy will be completely at fault.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I could write a great deal to explain my reasons for fearing that if\r\n    a war be not imminent the risk is at any rate so great that it ought\r\n    at once to be guarded against. My mind is almost unremittingly\r\n    employed in devising means to maintain the peace. In this, even more\r\n    than in ordinary cases, I think the best safeguard will be found in\r\n    being evidently prepared for war. Nothing is so likely to prevent an\r\n    attack as manifest readiness to prevent one. I have thought it right\r\n    to state to H.M. Government my opinion that it is not even now too\r\n    soon to put Canada into a complete state of defence and to provide\r\n    both in the West Indies and on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts the\r\n    means of resisting attack in case of war or of making our neutrality\r\n    respected if peace can be maintained.\r\n\r\n    Canada is, as you know, looked upon here as our weak point. There\r\n    are in the Cabinet men who are no doubt as ignorant of the state of\r\n    feeling in Canada as they were of that in the Southern States and\r\n    who believe that there is a strong American feeling in Canada. You\r\n    will not have forgotten that Mr. Seward, during the Presidential\r\n    canvass, publicly advocated the annexation of Canada as a\r\n    compensation for any loss which might be occasioned by the\r\n    disaffection of the South. The people calculate here (I am afraid\r\n    not without reason) upon being effectively aided in an inroad upon\r\n    Canada by the Irish Secret Societies which have been formed\r\n    especially in the State of New York nominally for the purpose of\r\n    invading Ireland.\r\n\r\n    I can hardly hope that you will not think the antecedent\r\n    improbability of this country's rushing to its ruin by adding\r\n    Foreign to Civil war so great as to prove that I must be led away by\r\n    visionary apprehensions. However this may be, it may be convenient\r\n    to you to know what my knowledge of men and things here has brought\r\n    me to believe and what I have in consequence written home.\r\n\r\n    Our Government has taken the only position sanctioned by\r\n    International law and by precedent. It observes absolute neutrality\r\n    and impartiality between the contending parties, recognizing, as it\r\n    is bound to do, both as invested with belligerent rights. No other\r\n    course was open to it, except that of an offensive alliance with one\r\n    side against the other. The North have certainly not asked for such\r\n    an alliance and would doubtless reject an offer of it with disdain.\r\n    And yet they choose to be in a fury because we do not try to occupy\r\n    some untenable position as their partisans.\r\n\r\n    No one defines our position more clearly than their own great\r\n    authority Wheaton.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, May 21, 1861.\r\n\r\n    One of the great difficulties I have to contend with in my endeavour\r\n    to keep this Government within such bounds as may render the\r\n    maintenance of peace possible is the persuasion which prevails even\r\n    with sensible men that _no_ outrage will compel England to make\r\n    war with the North. Such men, although seeing the inexpediency and\r\n    impropriety of Mr. Seward's treatment of the European Powers, still\r\n    do not think it worth while to risk their own mob popularity by\r\n    declaring against it. If they thought there was really any danger\r\n    they would no doubt do a great deal to avert it.\r\n\r\n    Of these men the most distinguished is Mr. Sumner. He has\r\n    considerable influence in Foreign Questions and holds the important\r\n    office of Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. He\r\n    is in correspondence with many people in England, and I believe with\r\n    the Duke and Duchess of Argyll. I think no greater service could be\r\n    rendered to the cause of peace than to make Mr. Sumner aware of the\r\n    real perils to which Mr. Seward and the Cabinet are exposing the\r\n    country. If some means cannot be devised of checking them, they will\r\n    carry not only arrogance but practical vexations to a pitch which\r\n    will render the maintenance of peace impossible. If Mr. Sumner's\r\n    correspondence from England convinced him that there was real danger\r\n    in Mr. Seward's proceedings, he might do a good deal to put a stop\r\n    to them. I think I have done something to shake his confidence, but\r\n    I believe he still relies to a great degree upon assurances he\r\n    received from England under circumstances wholly different from\r\n    those which now so unhappily exist.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years earlier, a British Minister, Sir John Crampton (like\r\nLord Sackville, in 1888), had been offered as a sacrifice to the Irish\r\nvote, and received his passport, and it began to look as if this\r\nspirited action might be repeated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, June 4, 1861.\r\n\r\n    The present game of the violent party appears to be to discover or\r\n    invent some shade of difference in the conduct of England and France\r\n    in order to use violent language, or even to take violent measures\r\n    against England without necessarily involving themselves in a\r\n    quarrel with France also. The plan most in vogue at this moment\r\n    seems to be to send me my passport. After their experience in the\r\n    case of Sir J. Crampton they look upon this as a measure which would\r\n    gain them most applause by its appearance of vigour without exposing\r\n    them to any real danger. They have not yet hit upon any fault to\r\n    find with me personally, except that I _must_ have written\r\n    unfriendly despatches to my government, because my government has\r\n    taken a course which they do not like. The whole is no doubt an\r\n    attempt to carry a point by bluster which will perhaps fail if it be\r\n    encountered with mild language and very firm conduct. For my own\r\n    part I conceive my best line will be to avoid giving any possible\r\n    reason for complaint against myself personally and to keep things as\r\n    smooth as I can. If H.M. Government concede nothing to violent\r\n    language it will _probably_ subside, but there is such a dementia\r\n    in some of the people here that we must not be surprised at any act of\r\n    violence they may commit.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Seward will be furious when he finds that his adherence to the\r\n    Declaration of Paris will not stop the Southern privateering. This\r\n    is one of the difficulties of making the proposals respecting\r\n    maritime law. But the great trouble will be the fuss which the\r\n    Southern government will make about receiving a communication from\r\n    England and France. It will be a great advantage to have a discreet\r\n    and able man like Mr. Bunch to employ in the South. I trust it may\r\n    be possible to grant him some compensation for the risk and loss to\r\n    which he is exposed by remaining there.\r\n\r\nAnother long letter of June 10 illustrates the tension of the situation,\r\nand again urges the necessity of attending to the defence of Canada.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord John Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, June 10, 1861.\r\n\r\n    I owe you more than common thanks for your private letter of the\r\n    25th.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Adams' Report of his first conversation with you appears to have\r\n    produced a good impression on the Cabinet. This I learn from Mr.\r\n    Chase, the Secretary of the Treasury, who dined with me the day\r\n    before yesterday. I have not seen Mr. Seward since they arrived. It\r\n    is too dangerous to talk to him on such subjects for me to bring\r\n    them up unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n    I hope we may see some moderation in the tone of the Newspapers.\r\n    The people in the North are beginning to be aware of the immense\r\n    encouragement which their predictions of a war with England have\r\n    given to their Southern Foe. I understand that the effect at\r\n    Richmond of the repeated assertions in the Northern Papers of the\r\n    hostility of England to the North has been prodigious.\r\n\r\n    I have written so much officially on the risk of a sudden\r\n    Declaration of War against England by the U.S. that I have nothing\r\n    to add on that subject. That such an act of madness is so far from\r\n    impossible, that we ought to be prepared for it at any moment, I\r\n    am thoroughly convinced. I am doing all I can to avoid awkward\r\n    questions--for to give way upon any such question would be still\r\n    more dangerous to peace than to make a firm stand. The safe course\r\n    therefore is to prevent questions arising, if possible. But the\r\n    first thing to be done towards obtaining anything like permanent\r\n    security is to remove the temptation to attack Canada.\r\n\r\n    I am a little nervous about our Company of Marines on San Juan. I\r\n    don't know that I can suggest any precautions to Governor Douglas\r\n    which would not be more likely to do harm than good. I have besides\r\n    no means of sending him a letter, which would not be liable to\r\n    be read on the way. I can communicate with the Admiral in the\r\n    Pacific in cypher, but I do not know where he may be. Under any\r\n    circumstances the Government here would of course be able to send\r\n    intelligence of war having broken out to the Pacific sooner than I\r\n    could.\r\n\r\n    M. Mercier, the French Minister here, appears to be very frank and\r\n    cordial with me. The instructions which he read to me insist very\r\n    strongly upon his acting in entire concert with me. I think he may\r\n    perhaps have received a confidential Despatch desiring him to\r\n    proceed cautiously, for he is going at a much slower pace than his\r\n    language a short time ago would have led one to expect. His giving\r\n    Mr. Seward a copy of the Exposition of the French Jurists on the\r\n    question of Belligerent Rights, as he did before of M. Thouvenel's\r\n    account of his conversation with Mr. Sanford, seems to show a\r\n    straightforward desire to make this Government acquainted with\r\n    the real sentiments and intentions of the Emperor. The language\r\n    M. Mercier uses to me and to his other Colleagues, as well as\r\n    that which he uses to Americans in my presence, is in direct\r\n    contradiction to the reports that France will assist the North,\r\n    which are so assiduously repeated and commented upon in the American\r\n    Newspapers. I am very willing to let him take the lead in our\r\n    communications about the Declaration of Paris. It would be playing\r\n    the game of the enemies to peace with England for me to go faster in\r\n    these matters than the French Minister.\r\n\r\n    Among other difficulties in the way of making your communication to\r\n    the Southern Consuls, is that of getting it safely to them. All\r\n    regular communication with the South is cut off. I suppose the\r\n    Government here would give either M. Mercier or me a Pass for a\r\n    special Messenger if we asked for one--but it may be desirable to\r\n    afford as little evidence as possible of our being connected with\r\n    the communication. The Southern Government will no doubt do all in\r\n    their power to give importance and publicity to the communication.\r\n    This Government will very probably withdraw the Exequaturs of the\r\n    Consuls who make it. The withdrawal would not be altogether free\r\n    from inconvenience to us, as it would interfere with the Consuls'\r\n    holding intercourse with the Blockading Squadrons, which it is\r\n    sometimes of importance that they should be able to do.\r\n\r\n    I think the English and French Governments will find it necessary to\r\n    make the Cabinet of Washington clearly understand that they _must_\r\n    and _will_ hold unofficial communication with the Southern\r\n    Government on matters concerning the interests of their subjects.\r\n    The announcement should if possible be made _collectively_, and in\r\n    such a form as to preclude the Cabinet's pretending to find a\r\n    difference between the conduct of France and England. The Government\r\n    of the U.S. can perform none of the duties of a Government towards\r\n    Foreigners in the Seceded States; and it is a preposterous\r\n    pretension to insist upon excluding Foreign Governments from\r\n    intercourse with the authorities however illegitimate, to whom their\r\n    Subjects must in fact look for protection.\r\n\r\n    The inactivity of the Troops on both sides would be satisfactory, if\r\n    one could hope that there was still any chance of the question's\r\n    being solved without any serious fighting. As it is, one would be\r\n    glad that something should be done as soon as possible to enable an\r\n    opinion to be formed on the relative strength and spirit of the\r\n    Armies. I believe that the real secret is that from want of training\r\n    in the men, and total lack of waggons, horses and other means of\r\n    transport, neither Government can move troops in any considerable\r\n    numbers except by railroad. I can see as yet no signs of the spirit\r\n    of conquest in the North flagging, or of the South losing courage.\r\n    The Financial Difficulty will be the great one on both sides. The\r\n    Southern men are said to serve without pay--but this Government has\r\n    fixed the pay of the volunteers and militiamen at the same rate as\r\n    that of the regular army, eleven dollars (about 45 shillings) a\r\n    month, for a private, in addition to clothes and rations.\r\n\r\n    I must do the little I can to influence the Senators and\r\n    Representatives when they come up next month; but there is only too\r\n    much reason to fear that fierceness against England will be popular,\r\n    and that the Legislators will vie with each other in manifesting it.\r\n    What I think they are most likely to do is to give the President\r\n    authority to declare war with us, without waiting for the sanction\r\n    of Congress.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Since I wrote what precedes I have been informed privately that in\r\n    Mr. Dayton's Report of his audience of the Emperor, there is a\r\n    rather ambiguous phrase put into the Emperor's mouth, respecting His\r\n    Majesty's desire to contribute to put an end to the dispute between\r\n    North and South. My informant says that the President and Mr. Seward\r\n    _really_ interpret the phrase as signifying that the Emperor would\r\n    be willing to assist the North to subdue the South--and that it is\r\n    from this supposition that Mr. Seward does not send M. Mercier back\r\n    the 'Exposition' and enter into the discussion about neutral Rights.\r\n    Mr. Seward is naturally puzzled by the apparent discrepancy between\r\n    the Emperor's language and that of His Majesty's Minister here. The\r\n    men in the State Department who are accustomed to business look, it\r\n    seems, upon the Emperor's words, even as reported by Mr. Dayton, as\r\n    no more than a vague assurance of goodwill, pointing to mediation\r\n    rather than to anything else. I will endeavour to get M. Mercier to\r\n    set the President and Mr. Seward right as soon as possible, for the\r\n    delusion is a very dangerous one for England, and a much more\r\n    dangerous one for the U.S.\r\n\r\nThe ill-feeling towards England continued to grow worse as time went on,\r\nand apparently was due largely to sentiment. The success of the South in\r\nfounding a practically independent government was so galling to the\r\nNorth that anything which implied the admission of a self-evident fact,\r\nsuch as the recognition of the Southern States as belligerents, was\r\ninexpressibly galling. Fortunately, England and France were acting in\r\nunison, and even Mr. Seward's ingenuity was unable to show that there\r\nwas any difference between the attitude of the two countries. Writing on\r\nJune 24, Lord Lyons reported that he had discovered that Mr. Seward had\r\nprepared a despatch which was all but a direct announcement of war, and\r\nthat it was only the intervention of the President and of the more\r\nreasonable members of the Cabinet which prevented its being sent to the\r\nAmerican Minister in London. The great qualities of President Lincoln,\r\nby the way, do not appear to have been recognized at this early period,\r\nfor competent judges pronounced that although well-meaning and\r\nconscientious, he gave no proof of possessing any natural talents to\r\ncompensate for his ignorance of everything but Illinois village\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July the military inactivity, due to causes mentioned\r\nearlier, came to an end, and the historic fight of Bull's Run took place\r\non the 21st.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, July 22, 1861.\r\n\r\n    It is too soon to form any speculations on the result of the defeat\r\n    of yesterday. Neither General Scott nor the Government had\r\n    calculated on the possibility of anything like it, and as for the\r\n    people of the North, they talked at all events as if the victory was\r\n    already theirs. If the North have anything like the spirit to which\r\n    they lay claim, they will rise with more resolution than ever to\r\n    avenge the defeat. The test will be the conduct of the Militia\r\n    Regiments. The three months' term of service of most of them has\r\n    just expired: some had gone home and the rest were on the point of\r\n    following--leaving the war to be carried on by the Volunteers and\r\n    the Regular Army. If the Militia regiments remain and others come\r\n    up, we may conclude that the warlike spirit of the North is\r\n    unbroken. If they do not, there may be a chance of peace. For this\r\n    battle will not facilitate recruiting for the army and the\r\n    Volunteers--and unless the Capitalists are urged by patriotism or\r\n    squeezed by mob pressure, the loans will fail and the money to pay\r\n    the Volunteers will not be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n    I am myself inclined to hope that Congress may show some dignity\r\n    and good sense. The general opinion is that it will be violent and\r\n    childish--vote men and money on paper by millions--slay its Southern\r\n    enemies by treason bills--and ruin them by confiscation acts--decree\r\n    the immediate and unconditional abolition of slavery in the Southern\r\n    States--the closing of the Ports, and what not.\r\n\r\nAmongst other results of Bull's Run was the production of the following\r\nminute by Lord Palmerston. If his judgment on the temper of the North\r\nwas completely wrong, his other observations might be profitably studied\r\nby the numerous persons in this country who hold the view that efficient\r\nmilitary forces can be improvised whenever an emergency arises.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    MINUTE OF LORD PALMERSTON.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 15, 1861.\r\n\r\n    The defeat at Bull's Run or rather at Yankee's Run proves two\r\n    things. First, that to bring together many thousand men and put\r\n    uniforms upon their backs and muskets in their hands is not to make\r\n    an army: discipline, experienced officers and confidence in the\r\n    steadiness of their comrades are necessary to make an army fight and\r\n    stand: secondly, that the Unionist cause is not in the hearts of the\r\n    mass of the population of the North. The Americans are not cowards:\r\n    individually they are as reckless of their own lives as of the lives\r\n    of others: ..., and it is not easy to believe that if they had felt\r\n    they were fighting for a great national interest they would have run\r\n    away as they did from the battle, or that whole regiments would have\r\n    quietly marched away home just before the fight was to begin. The\r\n    Truth is, the North are fighting for an Idea chiefly entertained by\r\n    professional politicians, while the South are fighting for what they\r\n    consider rightly or wrongly vital interests.\r\n\r\nThe defects and weaknesses disclosed by this defeat produced much\r\ncontemptuous criticism upon the military inefficiency of the United\r\nStates. In reality there was no cause for surprise. In April, 1861, the\r\nentire regular army of the United States only amounted to 16,000\r\nofficers and men. Many of the officers had taken sides with the South.\r\nNot one of them had ever had the opportunity of commanding any\r\nconsiderable number of troops, and public opinion was so entirely\r\nuninstructed concerning military questions that every local politician\r\nconsidered himself competent to become a colonel, or even a general. But\r\nwhat Bull's Run showed more conclusively than anything else, was that\r\nthe task of subjugating the South was infinitely greater than had\r\nbeen anticipated, and that the confident boastings of enthusiastic\r\nNortherners were as foolish as they were unjustified. We, however, as\r\na nation, had not then, and have now, little cause to jeer at the\r\nAmericans for their failure: we had embarked, only a few years earlier,\r\nupon the Crimean Campaign almost equally unprepared for a serious\r\nstruggle, and less than forty years later, in 1899, one of our most\r\neminent military authorities undertook to finish off the Boers before\r\nthe date of the Lord Mayor's Banquet.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Anglo-American relations showed a slight improvement,\r\nalthough Mr. Seward, in a characteristic outburst, took occasion to\r\npoint out that 'the policy of Foreign Governments was founded upon\r\nconsiderations of interest and of commerce, while that of the United\r\nStates was based on high and eternal considerations of principle and the\r\ngood of the human race; that the policy of foreign nations was regulated\r\nby the government which ruled them, while that of the United States was\r\ndirected by the unanimous and unchangeable will of the people.' Yet he\r\nhad clearly become more peaceable, and this welcome tendency was perhaps\r\ndue to the British Government having increased the Canadian garrisons in\r\nresponse to the urgent pressure of Lord Lyons and the Canadian\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Sir E. Head._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Aug. 2, 1861.\r\n\r\n    The intentions of the Government are at this moment more peaceful\r\n    than they have been. But I do not yet see any reason to modify the\r\n    views I expressed in my previous confidential letters. The present\r\n    change has been mainly produced by our preparations for defence and\r\n    by the quiet firmness with which we have maintained the position we\r\n    took up with regard to Belligerent Rights. I think it as necessary\r\n    as ever to complete our preparations for defence, and I find that\r\n    the knowledge that we are making such preparations calms instead of\r\n    irritating this people.\r\n\r\n    There is nothing very surprising in raw levies being seized with\r\n    such a panic as that which led to the flight from Bull's Run. The\r\n    want of spirit before and since shown by the Militia regiments is a\r\n    worse sign. Two went away, on their term expiring, one may say from\r\n    the battlefield itself. The defeat, and even the danger of\r\n    Washington being taken, have been unable to induce any whose time is\r\n    up to remain. The Government considers that we are now safe again\r\n    from an attack here, but for some days our reliance was only upon\r\n    its not entering into the enemy's plan to come here.\r\n\r\n    As day after day passes without an onward movement of the Southern\r\n    troops, the war spirit seems to revive in the North. But it will\r\n    require a decided Northern victory to bring back the enthusiasm and\r\n    the unanimity which appeared on the fall of Fort Sumter. A peace\r\n    party is beginning to show itself timidly and weakly, but much more\r\n    openly than it would have dared to do two months ago.\r\n\r\n    We have nearly got through another Tariff Bill without a serious\r\n    attack upon the Reciprocity Treaty, thanks more to the haste, I am\r\n    afraid, than the good will of the Legislators. It will be a\r\n    wonderful tariff, whichever of the plans now before Congress is\r\n    adopted.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Seward some weeks ago took credit to himself for having recalled\r\n    Mr. Ashman on finding that his mission was ill looked on. This gave\r\n    me a good opportunity of telling him that H.M. Government\r\n    considered that they had a good right to complain of his having been\r\n    sent at all without proper communication being previously made to\r\n    them and to me.\r\n\r\n    I have applied for the discharge of the two minors about whom you\r\n    wrote to me officially. I am not sure of getting it. My applications\r\n    for discharge from the Army and Navy have become necessarily so\r\n    numerous that they are not viewed with favour.\r\n\r\nSuch elaborate pains had been taken to prevent anything in the least\r\nlikely to irritate the Government of the United States, that it was all\r\nthe more annoying when an incident occurred which gave excuse for\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nThe Consuls in the Southern States were permitted to send their\r\ndespatches in Foreign Office bags through the lines on the reasonable\r\ncondition that no advantage was to be taken of the privilege in order to\r\nprovide information which might be of use to the enemies of the United\r\nStates Government. The rule was rigidly observed at the Legation, and\r\nthe Consuls had been repeatedly warned not to infringe it in any way;\r\nbut in an evil hour, Mr. Bunch, the British Consul at Charleston, a\r\ncapable and industrious official, committed his bag to a friend, who,\r\nunknown to the Consul, also took charge of about two hundred private\r\nletters. The messenger was arrested by the United States authorities,\r\nand imprisoned. The letters, of course, were seized, but so also was the\r\nForeign Office bag, addressed to Lord Russell, and a Foreign Office bag\r\nhas always been considered as one of the most sacred objects upon earth.\r\nThe United States Government, professing that a most serious offence had\r\nbeen committed, and taking advantage of an error in the passport of the\r\nmessenger, sent the bag over to London by special messenger, and\r\ndemanded the recall of the unfortunate Consul Bunch. The opportunity, in\r\nshort, was too good to be lost. When the bag was eventually opened, in\r\nDowning Street, it was found to contain nothing but despatches and a few\r\nletters from British governesses and servants who had been permitted to\r\nmake use of it in consequence of the discontinuance of the post. In\r\nfact, it was an essentially trivial matter, but the tension between the\r\ntwo countries was so great that Lord Russell thought that it might\r\npossibly lead to a rupture of official relations, and sent the following\r\ninstructions:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Abergeldie Castle, Sept. 13, 1861.\r\n\r\n    It is not very probable, but it is possible that the complaint\r\n    against Bunch may be a preliminary to the breaking off of official\r\n    intercourse between the two countries.\r\n\r\n    Your name has been kept out of the correspondence on both sides,\r\n    but if the Envoys are to be withdrawn, you will be sent away from\r\n    Washington.\r\n\r\n    In that case I wish you to express in the most dignified and guarded\r\n    terms that the course taken by the Washington Government must be the\r\n    result of a misconception on their part, and that you shall retire\r\n    to Canada in the persuasion that the misunderstanding will soon\r\n    cease, and the former friendly relations be restored.\r\n\r\n    It is very desirable to obtain an explanation from Consul Bunch, and\r\n    you may authorize Admiral Milne, after due notice, to Mr. Seward, to\r\n    send a gunboat to Charleston for the purpose.\r\n\r\nConsul Bunch, in spite of his troubles, remained for over a year in\r\nCharleston after this incident. Eventually the American Government\r\nrevoked his exequatur, and he made a semi-state return to England in a\r\nman-of-war.\r\n\r\nIn the late autumn, Mr. Seward began to show signs of returning to his\r\nearlier manner, and it was plain enough that he had only been seeking to\r\ngain time by his moderation. He now maintained that any communication\r\nbetween a Foreign Government and the Confederate Government was an\r\noffence against the United States, and it became more and more necessary\r\nfor England and France to come to some distinct agreement as to what the\r\nnature and extent of those communications should be. Mr. Seward's\r\ncontention was obviously absurd. South Carolina had seceded nearly a\r\nyear previously. State after State had followed its example; the United\r\nStates Government had not made the slightest progress in restoring its\r\nauthority, and exercised no power or influence in any portion of the new\r\nConfederation. On the other hand, there was a _de facto_ government in\r\nthat Confederation which was obeyed without question and exercised the\r\nfunctions of government with perfect regularity. It was clear that a\r\ngovernment which was without the means of protecting British subjects\r\nhad no right to prevent us from holding necessary and informal\r\ncommunications with the only power to which British subjects could look\r\nfor protection and redress of grievances. Cases of British subjects\r\nbeing compulsorily enlisted, of British goods being seized on board\r\nvessels captured by Southern privateers, and instances of a similar\r\nnature were of constant occurrence. It was preposterous that under these\r\nconditions British Consuls should be expected to refrain from\r\ncommunication with the Confederate authorities. Fortunately, although\r\nthe British interests involved were infinitely the more important,\r\nFrench interests were affected too, and upon this, as upon most other\r\ndifficult questions, Lord Lyons received the hearty and loyal support of\r\nhis French colleague, M. Mercier.\r\n\r\nOn November 8, an incident of the gravest nature occurred, which seemed\r\nlikely to render futile all the laborious efforts which had been made to\r\nkeep the peace between England and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe English mail steamer _Trent_, one day out from Havannah, was met by\r\nthe American warship _San Jacinto_ and stopped by a shell fired across\r\nher bows. She was then boarded by a party of marines, and the officer in\r\ncommand of the party demanded a list of the passengers. The production\r\nof the list having been refused, the officer stated that he knew the\r\nConfederate delegates to Europe, Messrs. Mason and Slidell, to be on\r\nboard, and insisted upon their surrender. Whilst the discussion was in\r\nprogress, Mr. Slidell made his appearance and disclosed his identity.\r\nThereupon, in defiance of the protests of the captain of the _Trent_ and\r\nof the Government mail agent, Mr. Slidell and Mr. Mason, together with\r\ntheir secretaries, were seized and carried off by force to the _San\r\nJacinto_, and taken as prisoners to New York.\r\n\r\nThe news arrived in England on November 27, and, naturally, caused the\r\ngreatest excitement and indignation. It was felt that the limits of\r\nconcession had been reached, that a stand must now be made if we ever\r\nintended to maintain our national rights, and, as a proof that they were\r\nin earnest, the Government decided upon the immediate despatch of 8000\r\nmen to Canada.\r\n\r\nThe first private letter from Lord Lyons was written on November 19.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Nov. 19, 1861.\r\n\r\n    I have written so much officially on this unfortunate affair of\r\n    Mason and Slidell that I have hardly left myself time to thank you\r\n    for your kind private letter of the 2nd.\r\n\r\n    I am told confidently that orders were given at Washington which led\r\n    to the capture on board the _Trent_, and that they were signed by\r\n    Mr. Seward without the knowledge of the President. I do not vouch\r\n    for the truth of this. I am afraid he is not sorry to have a\r\n    question with us like this, in which it is difficult for France to\r\n    take a part.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons had made up his mind from the first that, as it was\r\nimpossible for him to form a correct opinion as to what had actually\r\noccurred, the only thing to do was to maintain an attitude of complete\r\nreserve. In the absence of authentic information, he felt that on the\r\none hand it would be unsafe to ask for a reparation which might be\r\ninadequate; on the other hand he was reluctant to make a demand which\r\nmight be unnecessarily great. Consequently, he resolved to take no steps\r\nuntil he received instructions from home, refused to say a word on the\r\nsubject either officially or unofficially, and instructed the Consuls to\r\nmaintain silence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Nov. 22, 1861.\r\n\r\n    I have all along been expecting some such blow as the capture on\r\n    board the _Trent_. Turn out how it may, it must I fear produce an\r\n    effect on public opinion in both countries which will go far to\r\n    disconcert all my peaceful plans and hopes. I am so worn out with\r\n    the never-ending labour of keeping things smooth, under the\r\n    discouragement of the doubt whether by so doing I am not after all\r\n    only leading these people to believe that they may go all lengths\r\n    with us with impunity that I am sometimes half tempted to wish that\r\n    the worst may have come already. However I do not allow this feeling\r\n    to influence my conduct, and I have done nothing which can in the\r\n    least interfere with any course which you may take concerning the\r\n    affair of the _Trent_.\r\n\r\n    If the effect on the people and Government of this country were the\r\n    only thing to be considered, it would be a case for an extreme\r\n    measure one way or the other. If the capture be unjustifiable we\r\n    should ask for the immediate release of the prisoners, promptly,\r\n    imperatively, with a determination to act at once, if the demand\r\n    were refused. If, on the other hand, the capture be justifiable,\r\n    we should at once say so and declare that we have no complaint to\r\n    make on the subject. Even so, we should not escape the evil of\r\n    encouraging the Americans in the belief that we shall bear anything\r\n    from them. For they have made up their minds that they have insulted\r\n    us, although the fear of the consequences prevents their giving vent\r\n    to their exultation. They would not however consider it so manifest\r\n    a proof of yielding on our part if we at once declared that we had\r\n    nothing to complain of, as if we did complain without obtaining full\r\n    reparation. Of course, however, I am well aware that public opinion\r\n    in this country is not the only thing to be thought of in this\r\n    question. While maintaining entire reserve on the question itself, I\r\n    have avoided any demonstration of ill-humour. My object has been, on\r\n    the one hand, not to prevent the Government being led by its present\r\n    apprehensions to take some conciliatory step, and on the other hand\r\n    not to put H.M. Government or myself in an awkward position, if it\r\n    should after all appear that we should not be right to make the\r\n    affair a serious ground of complaint.\r\n\r\n    Congress will meet on December 2nd, which will not diminish the\r\n    difficulty of managing matters here. It is supposed that General\r\n    McClellan will be obliged to attempt some forward movement, in\r\n    order that he and the Government may be able to meet the fiery\r\n    legislators. They hoped the Beaufort affair would have been\r\n    sufficient, but like all they do, the effect is so much weakened,\r\n    first by the preposterous boastings beforehand, and secondly by the\r\n    fabulous accounts of the success first given, that something new\r\n    must if possible be provided.\r\n\r\n    The Finances are kept in an apparently prosperous condition, by\r\n    postponing all but the most pressing payments. In this manner the\r\n    New York Banks are not pressed to pay up the sums they have taken of\r\n    the Loan. The people are so enamoured of their last brilliant\r\n    discovery in political economy that it was seriously intended to\r\n    raise the Morrill Tariff, in order that no money might go out of the\r\n    country and nothing be imported but 'gold and silver to carry on the\r\n    war with.' The Cabinet has now however, I understand, determined to\r\n    recommend that the Morrill Tariff be not touched. One cannot help\r\n    hoping that some one may be reasonable enough to suggest the idea of\r\n    a Revenue Tariff.\r\n\r\n    General McClellan's own plan is said to be to gain a great victory,\r\n    and then, with or without the sanction of Congress and the\r\n    President, to propose the most favourable terms to the South if it\r\n    will only come back. It is a curious sign of the confusion into\r\n    which things are falling, that such a plan is coolly discussed. I\r\n    mean that part of it which consists in the General's acting without\r\n    the consent of the President and Congress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Nov. 25, 1861.\r\n\r\n    The people here are extremely frightened about the capture on board\r\n    the _Trent_. The New York money market gives signs of this. Another\r\n    indication is the moderation of the newspapers, which is for them\r\n    wonderful. They have put in more correct accounts of my language (or\r\n    rather silence). I rather suspect that this must have been done on a\r\n    hint from Mr. Seward. As a general rule I abstain from noticing\r\n    anything the newspapers say about me. On this occasion in particular\r\n    contradiction from me would have been almost as dangerous as\r\n    affirmation, so I left the assertions to take their chance.\r\n\r\n    The Consuls in the South do not behave well about forwarding private\r\n    letters. There is a fresh case which I report to-day. Mr. Seward\r\n    has, I think, behaved properly about it. I am afraid I shall be\r\n    obliged to ask you to support me by some severe act, if my last\r\n    instruction is not obeyed.\r\n\r\n    I write, as indeed I act, as if our relations with this Government\r\n    were to be unchanged. Let the affair of the capture on board the\r\n    _Trent_ turn out how it may, I am not confident that I shall long\r\n    be able to do so.\r\n\r\nWriting on the same date to Admiral Milne, he repeats that nothing\r\nwhatever has passed between him and the U.S. Government on the subject\r\nof the _Trent_, and adds: 'I suppose I am the only man in America who\r\nhas expressed no opinion whatever either on the International Law\r\nquestion, or on the course which our Government will take.' Such\r\nreticence appears almost superhuman.\r\n\r\nThe attitude, however, of an important section of the American public\r\nwas anything but reticent. Captain Wilkes sprang at once into the\r\nposition of a national hero. Congress passed a vote of thanks to him; he\r\nwas banqueted, toasted, serenaded, and shortly became an admiral. A\r\nmember of the Government, Mr. Welles, Secretary of the Navy, noted for\r\nhis hostility to England, distinguished himself by officially\r\ncongratulating Captain Wilkes upon his heroic action; intimating at the\r\nsame time that the 'generous forbearance' he had shown in not capturing\r\nthe _Trent_ could not be treated as a precedent in subsequent cases of\r\nthe infraction of neutral obligations. The Governor of Boston also\r\ndistinguished himself by the following statement at a public banquet:\r\n'That there may be nothing left to crown this exaltation, Commodore\r\nWilkes fired his shot across the bows of the ship that bore the British\r\nlion at its head,' while many other prominent citizens followed his\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Nov. 29, 1861.\r\n\r\n    The Consuls in the South are crying out for ships again. This is the\r\n    solution for every difficulty in the Consular mind, as my experience\r\n    in the Mediterranean taught me long ago; though what the ships were\r\n    to do, except fire a salute in honour of the Consul, I could never\r\n    discover. I had some trouble, as you may perhaps recollect, in\r\n    checking the Consular ardour to send ships up the Potomac to my own\r\n    relief last spring. Sir A. Milne objects strongly to sending ships\r\n    to the Southern Ports, unless with a specific object and definite\r\n    instructions, and I think he is quite right. It is quite true that a\r\n    town _may_ be bombarded some day by the United States forces: that\r\n    British subjects may have their throats cut by the negroes in a\r\n    servile insurrection, or be tarred and feathered by a Vigilance\r\n    Committee. But we cannot keep a squadron at every point to protect\r\n    them, and I do not know what points are particularly threatened.\r\n\r\n    I shall do all in my power to keep things smooth until I receive\r\n    your orders about the _Trent_ affair. This can in any event do no\r\n    harm. There is a story here that, in a recent hypothetical case, the\r\n    Law Officers of the Crown decided in favour of the right of the\r\n    United States to take Mason and Slidell out of a British ship or\r\n    postal packet. I do not know whether Mr. Adams has written this to\r\n    Mr. Seward, but I am inclined to think that the Government believe\r\n    it to be true.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty as to the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown\r\nrendered it all the more necessary to keep quiet and wait for orders,\r\nand the situation was rendered a little easier on account of there being\r\nno mention of the _Trent_ in the Presidential Message. Mr. Galt,\r\nthe Canadian Finance Minister, happened to be in Washington at the\r\nbeginning of December, and had an interesting conversation with\r\nPresident Lincoln, who disclaimed for himself and the Cabinet all\r\nthought of aggression against Canada. The President also stated that he\r\nhimself had been opposed to Mr. Seward's circular putting the coasts\r\ninto a state of defence, but had been overruled. On being asked what the\r\nrecommendation to make fortifications and depôts of arms on the Great\r\nLakes meant, he only said, 'We must say something to satisfy the\r\npeople.' About the Mason and Slidell case, he remarked, 'Oh, that'll be\r\ngot along with!' He further volunteered the observation that if he could\r\nnot within a reasonable period get hold of Virginia, Kentucky, and\r\nMissouri, and keep Maryland, he should tell the American people to give\r\nup the contest, for it would be 'too big' for them.\r\n\r\nThe impression produced upon Mr. Galt was that President Lincoln himself\r\nwas honest and sincere in what he said, but that he was very far from\r\nbeing master of his Cabinet. Mr. Galt returned to Canada, bearing a\r\nletter to Lord Monck, the new Governor-General, urging the necessity of\r\npreparing for defence, and also an ingenious arrangement for warning the\r\nCanadian Government in case of emergency, without having recourse to\r\ncypher telegrams, which might arouse the suspicions of the Americans.\r\n\r\nOn December 13, intelligence was received in America of the arrival in\r\nEngland of the first news of the capture of Mason and Slidell, the\r\nsubmarine cable, of course, not being at that time in operation. A great\r\nfall in all securities immediately took place.\r\n\r\nAt midnight on the 18th, the Queen's messenger bearing the fateful\r\ndespatches from Lord Russell arrived at the British Legation at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe principal despatch, dated November 30, 1861, had been drawn up after\r\nconsideration by the Cabinet, and the purport of it was that the United\r\nStates Government were informed that International Law and the rights of\r\nGreat Britain had been violated, that H.M. Government trusted that the\r\nact would be disavowed, the prisoners set free and restored to British\r\nprotection. Should this demand be refused, Lord Lyons was instructed to\r\nleave Washington.\r\n\r\nThe draft of this despatch was submitted to the Queen, and, in the\r\nopinion of the Prince Consort, the wording was of somewhat too\r\nperemptory a character. The suggestions of the Prince Consort were\r\nembodied in a memorandum quoted by Sir Theodore Martin in his book, and\r\nthe object of them was to remove any expressions in the despatch which\r\nmight unduly affront a sensitive nation, and at the same time enable it\r\nto retreat from a false position without loss of credit or dignity. The\r\nPrince was suffering from a mortal illness at the time, and was dead\r\nwithin a fortnight; it was the last occasion upon which he took any part\r\nin public affairs, but never, probably, did he render a greater service\r\nto the country of his adoption than when he persuaded the Cabinet to\r\nmodify the wording of this momentous despatch. As amended in accordance\r\nwith the Prince Consort's suggestions, the crucial passages ran as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty's Government, bearing in mind the friendly relations\r\n    which have long subsisted between Great Britain and the United\r\n    States, are willing to believe that the United States's naval\r\n    officer who committed this aggression was not acting in compliance\r\n    with any authority from his Government, or that if he conceived\r\n    himself to be so authorized, he greatly misunderstood the\r\n    instructions which he had received.\r\n\r\n    For the Government of the United States must be fully aware that\r\n    the British Government could not allow such an affront to the\r\n    national honour to pass without full reparation, and Her Majesty's\r\n    Government are unwilling to believe that it could be the deliberate\r\n    intention of the Government of the United States unnecessarily to\r\n    force into discussion between the two Governments a question of so\r\n    grave a character, and with regard to which the whole British nation\r\n    would be sure to entertain such unanimity of feeling.\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty's Government, therefore, trust that when this matter\r\n    shall have been brought under the consideration of the Government of\r\n    the United States, that Government will, of its own accord, offer to\r\n    the British Government such redress as alone would satisfy the\r\n    British nation, namely, the liberation of the four gentlemen, and\r\n    their delivery to your Lordship, in order that they may again be\r\n    placed under British protection, and a suitable apology for the\r\n    aggression which has been committed.\r\n\r\n    Should these terms not be offered by Mr. Seward, you will propose\r\n    them to him.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in the above there is nothing of an aggressive\r\nor minatory nature, but in a further despatch of the same date, Lord\r\nLyons was instructed to allow Mr. Seward a delay of seven days, if the\r\nlatter asked for it. If at the end of seven days no answer was returned,\r\nor any answer which was not a compliance with the demands of Her\r\nMajesty's Government, then the British Minister was directed to leave\r\nWashington with all the members of his staff and the archives, and to\r\nrepair forthwith to London.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the despatches was a private letter from Lord Russell to\r\nLord Lyons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Pembroke Lodge, Dec. 1, 1861.\r\n\r\n    The despatches which were agreed to at the Cabinet yesterday and\r\n    which I have signed this morning impose upon you a disagreeable\r\n    task.\r\n\r\n    My wish would be that at your first interview with Mr. Seward you\r\n    should not take my despatch with you, but should prepare him for it,\r\n    and ask him to settle with the President and his Cabinet what course\r\n    they would propose.\r\n\r\n    The next time you should bring my despatch and read it to him fully.\r\n\r\n    If he asks you what will be the consequence of his refusing compliance\r\n    I think you should say that you wish to leave him and the President\r\n    quite free to take their own course, and that you desire to abstain\r\n    from anything like menace. I think the disposition of the Cabinet is\r\n    to accept the liberation of the captive commissioners and to be\r\n    rather easy about the apology: that is to say if the Commissioners\r\n    are delivered to you and allowed to embark in a packet for England,\r\n    and an apology or explanation is sent through Mr. Adams that might\r\n    be taken as a substantial compliance. But if the Commissioners are\r\n    not liberated, no apology will suffice.\r\n\r\n    M. Thouvenel promises to send off a despatch on Thursday next giving\r\n    our cause moral support, so that you may as well keep the despatch\r\n    itself a day or two before you produce it, provided you ask at once\r\n    for an interview with Seward.\r\n\r\n    The feeling here is very quiet but very decided. There is no party\r\n    about it: all are unanimous.\r\n\r\n    The best thing would be if Seward could be turned out, and a\r\n    rational man put in his place. I hear it said that the Americans\r\n    will not fight, but we must not count upon that.\r\n\r\n    I have every reliance that you will discharge your task in the\r\n    temper of firmness and calmness which befits a British\r\n    representative.\r\n\r\nMr. Hammond, the permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, whose\r\njudgment was in after years shown to be far from infallible, expressed\r\nthe opinion that Messrs. Mason and Slidell would be immediately\r\nexecuted, so that there might be an answer ready whenever their release\r\nwas demanded. A warship was ordered to proceed from Halifax to New York\r\nto receive the members of the Legation in case an unfavourable reply\r\nshould be received from the American Government.\r\n\r\nOn December 7, Lord Russell wrote again privately to Lord Lyons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, Dec. 7, 1861.\r\n\r\n    I have been going over in my mind the possible evasive answers of\r\n    Mr. Seward, falling short of substantial compliance with our\r\n    demands, in order to give you some contingent instructions.\r\n\r\n    But the result is that I fear I should embarrass you more by such a\r\n    course, than by leaving you to the exercise of your own excellent\r\n    judgment.\r\n\r\n    What we want is a plain Yes, or a plain No to our very simple\r\n    demands, and we want that plain Yes or No within seven days of the\r\n    communication of the despatch.\r\n\r\n    The devices for avoiding the plain course are endless, and the\r\n    ingenuity of American lawyers will seek perhaps to entangle you in\r\n    endless arguments on Vattel, Wheaton and Scott.\r\n\r\n    Here are two plain answers. If the _Trent_ had been brought into\r\n    Boston harbour, the Prize Court must have condemned the captors to\r\n    pay costs for illegal detention. This, at least, is our opinion.\r\n\r\n    But Captain Wilkes superseded the authority of the Courts instituted\r\n    and recognized by the Law of Nations. Seeing that there was no\r\n    chance that any Court of Justice, or any law could justify the\r\n    capture of the four Americans, Captain Wilkes has set aside all\r\n    Courts of Justice and all law, and has taken into his own hands, by\r\n    virtue of his cannons and cutlasses, the solution of a question\r\n    which demanded if raised at all, a regular, a solemn and a legal\r\n    decision.\r\n\r\n    These are the grounds therefore upon which our demands are based and\r\n    upon which they should be urged.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--I have just received your letter of the 22nd. If you receive\r\n    the Confederate prisoners under the protection of the British flag,\r\n    we shall be satisfied. But if that is not to be obtained, you will\r\n    only have to obey your instructions and withdraw.\r\n\r\nMr. Hammond, a very unfortunate prophet, predicted that 'the Americans\r\nwill never give way. The humiliation will be too great, and after all\r\ntheir boastings against Europe, they will scarcely be satisfied to yield\r\nto the common reprobation with which the act has been received. We hear,\r\ntoo, that the President himself is most determined against concession,\r\nhaving rejected peremptorily General McClellan's conciliatory advice.'\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that if Mr. Hammond was wrong, plenty of\r\nother people shared his views on both sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nLord Russell's despatch having arrived at Washington late at night on\r\nDecember 18, Lord Lyons called upon Mr. Seward on the 19th, and\r\nacquainted him with its general tenour. Mr. Seward received the\r\ncommunication seriously and with dignity, nor did he manifest any\r\ndissatisfaction. At the conclusion of the interview, he asked to be\r\ngiven the following day for consideration, and also for communication\r\nwith the President. He thought that on the 21st he would be able to\r\nexpress an opinion upon the communication, and in the meanwhile\r\nexpressed his gratification at the friendly and conciliatory manner in\r\nwhich it had been made by the British Representative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Dec. 19, 1861.\r\n\r\n    Before I left Mr. Seward he said that there was one question which\r\n    he would put to me 'informally,' but which it was most important\r\n    that I should answer. Was any time fixed by my instructions within\r\n    which the U.S. Government must reply? I told him that I did not like\r\n    to answer the question; that what of all things I wished to avoid\r\n    was the slightest appearance of a menace. He said I need not fear\r\n    that; he only wished me to tell him privately and confidentially. I\r\n    said that on that understanding, I would tell him that the term was\r\n    seven days. He then said that much time would be lost if I did not\r\n    let him have a copy of your despatch 'unofficially and informally';\r\n    that so much depended upon the wording of it, that it was impossible\r\n    to come to a decision without reading it. I told him that the only\r\n    difficulty I had about giving it to him at once officially was that\r\n    the seven days would at once begin to run. He said that was very\r\n    true, but I might let him have it on the understanding that no one\r\n    but himself and the President should know that I had done so. I was\r\n    very glad to let him have it on these terms. It will give time for\r\n    the Packet (which is indeed already due) to arrive with M.\r\n    Thouvenel's Despatch to M. Mercier, and in the meantime give Mr.\r\n    Seward who is now on the peace side of the Cabinet time to work with\r\n    the President before the affair comes before the Cabinet itself. I\r\n    sent the Despatch to him in an envelope marked 'Private and\r\n    Confidential.' Almost immediately afterwards he came here. He told\r\n    me he was pleased to find that the Despatch was courteous and\r\n    friendly, and not dictatorial or menacing. There was however one\r\n    question more which he must ask me, without an answer to which he\r\n    could not act, but at the same time he must have the answer only in\r\n    strict confidence between himself and me. I had told him in\r\n    confidence that I was to wait seven days for an answer on the\r\n    subject of the redress we required. Supposing he was within the\r\n    seven days to send me a refusal, or a proposal to discuss the\r\n    question? I told him that my instructions were positive and left me\r\n    no discretion. If the answer was not satisfactory, and particularly\r\n    if it did not include the immediate surrender of the Prisoners, I\r\n    could not accept it.\r\n\r\n    I was not sorry to tell him this in the way I did. I avoided all\r\n    menace which could be an obstacle to the U.S. yielding, while I did\r\n    the only thing which will make them yield if they ever do, let them\r\n    know that we were really in earnest.\r\n\r\n    I don't think it likely they will give in, but I do not think it\r\n    impossible they may do so, particularly if the next news from\r\n    England brings note of warlike preparations, and determination on\r\n    the part of the Government and people.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Seward has taken up all my time, which is my excuse for this\r\n    scrawl. I shall be able to write to you to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe second interview took place on the 21st, and the following letter\r\nexplains the reasons for allowing Mr. Seward an additional two days--a\r\nhappy expedient, which probably contributed in great measure to the\r\nultimate solution of the difficulty--and also graphically depicts the\r\ngeneral uncertainty and alarm which prevailed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Dec. 23, 1861.\r\n\r\n    I have followed, I think to the letter, in my communications with\r\n    Mr. Seward on the _Trent_ affair, the plan laid down in your private\r\n    letter of the 1st. The packet is unfortunately so late that M.\r\n    Mercier will not receive the promised instruction from M. Thouvenel\r\n    until to-morrow, but I could not have again put off communicating\r\n    your despatch to Mr. Seward without an appearance of vacillation\r\n    which would have been fatal. No time was practically lost by my\r\n    consenting to the delay from Saturday to Monday, for whether the\r\n    seven days expired on Saturday next or Monday next, I should have\r\n    been equally unable to announce the result to you sooner than by the\r\n    packet which will sail from New York on Wednesday, the 1st January.\r\n\r\n    I feel little or no doubt that I shall have an answer of some kind\r\n    before the seven days are over. What it will be depends very much\r\n    upon the news which will be brought by the packet to-morrow. If it\r\n    convinces the people here that it is surrender or war, without any\r\n    hope of a diversion in their favour by France, our terms will\r\n    perhaps be complied with. If there is any hope left that there will\r\n    be only a rupture of Diplomatic Relations, or that we shall accept\r\n    the mediation of France, no concession will be made. There is no\r\n    doubt that both government and people are very much frightened, but\r\n    still I do not think anything but the first shot will convince the\r\n    bulk of the population that England will really go to war.\r\n\r\n    M. Mercier went of his own accord to Mr. Seward the day before\r\n    yesterday and expressed strongly his own conviction that the choice\r\n    lay only between a compliance with the demands of England and war.\r\n    He begged Mr. Seward to dismiss all idea of assistance from France,\r\n    and not to be led away by the vulgar notion that the Emperor would\r\n    gladly see England embroiled with the United States in order to\r\n    pursue his own plans in Europe without opposition. He said that if\r\n    he could be of use, by making these sentiments known to Senators and\r\n    other influential people, he was quite ready to do so. Mr. Seward\r\n    asked him whether he had received special instructions from his\r\n    Government on the subject. M. Mercier said no, but that he expected\r\n    some immediately, and that he had no doubt whatever what they would\r\n    be. Mr. Seward did not accept his offer to prepare influential men\r\n    here for giving way, but merely said, 'Let us wait and see what your\r\n    instructions really turn out to be.'\r\n\r\n    It is announced that General Scott is more than halfway across the\r\n    Atlantic on his way here, I suppose in the hope of appearing again\r\n    on the stage as the Grand Pacificator. If he gives the sanction of\r\n    his name to a compliance with our terms he will certainly render the\r\n    compliance easier to the Government and less unpalatable to the\r\n    people. But I cannot foresee any circumstances, under which I should\r\n    be justified in departing from your instructions. Unless I receive\r\n    an announcement that the prisoners will be surrendered to _us_, and\r\n    at least not a refusal to make an apology before noon on this day\r\n    week, no other course will be open to me than to demand my passports\r\n    and those of all the members of the Legation and go away at once. In\r\n    case of a non-compliance, or of the time elapsing without any\r\n    answer, it will probably be desirable for me to take myself, the\r\n    Secretary of Legation, and the greater part of the Attachés off at\r\n    once, leaving, if necessary, one or two of the junior attachés to\r\n    pack up the archives and follow as quickly as possible. It is a case\r\n    in which, above all others, delay will be dangerous. I am so\r\n    convinced that unless we give our friends here a good lesson this\r\n    time, we shall have the same trouble with them again very soon,\r\n    under less advantageous circumstances, that even my regard for them\r\n    leads me to think it all important that they should receive the\r\n    lesson. Surrender or war will have a very good effect upon them, but\r\n    anything less will make them more self-confident than ever, and lead\r\n    them on to their ruin.\r\n\r\n    I do not think there is any danger of the Government's deliberately\r\n    taking any step to precipitate hostilities upon my departure. On the\r\n    contrary, if they let me go, it will be in the hope that the\r\n    interruption of diplomatic relations will be all they have to fear\r\n    from us. But they have so little control over their officers, that I\r\n    think we must be prepared for acts of violence from subordinates, if\r\n    they have the chance of performing them, in cases where no immediate\r\n    danger is incurred. I shall suggest to the Governors and Naval\r\n    Officers to take reasonable precautions against such acts. A\r\n    filibustering expedition of the Irish on the frontiers of Canada, to\r\n    damage the canals, or something of that sort, may also be on the\r\n    cards.\r\n\r\n    It is generally believed that the Government will insist on an\r\n    immediate advance of the Grand Army of the Potomac, in the hope of\r\n    covering a surrender to England with (to use President Lincoln's\r\n    phraseology) a 'sugar coating' of glory, in another quarter if\r\n    possible.\r\n\r\n    You will perhaps be surprised to find Mr. Seward on the side of\r\n    peace. He does not like the look of the spirit he has called up. Ten\r\n    months of office have dispelled many of his illusions. I presume\r\n    that he no longer believes in the existence of a Union Party in the\r\n    South, in the return of the South to the arms of the North in case\r\n    of a foreign war; in his power to frighten the nations of Europe by\r\n    great words; in the ease with which the U.S. could crush rebellion\r\n    with one hand and chastise Europe with the other; in the notion that\r\n    the relations with England in particular are safe playthings to be\r\n    used for the amusement of the American people. He sees himself in a\r\n    very painful dilemma. But he knows his countrymen well enough to\r\n    believe that if he can convince them that there is a real danger\r\n    of war, they may forgive him for the humiliation of yielding to\r\n    England, while it would be fatal to him to be the author of a\r\n    disastrous foreign war. How he will act eventually, I cannot say.\r\n    It will be hard for him to face present unpopularity, and if the\r\n    President and Cabinet throw the whole burden on his shoulders, he\r\n    may refuse to bear it. I hope that without embarrassing him with\r\n    official threats, I have made him aware himself of the extreme\r\n    danger of refusing our terms.\r\n\r\n    Since I have been writing this letter, M. Mercier has come in and\r\n    related to me more in detail the conversation he had with Mr. Seward\r\n    the day before yesterday. In addition to what I have already\r\n    mentioned, he says that he told Mr. Seward that it would be\r\n    impossible for France to blame England for precisely the same course\r\n    that she would herself have pursued in similar circumstances: that\r\n    of course he could not pretend to give advice on a question\r\n    concerning national honour without being asked to do so, but that it\r\n    might be of advantage to the U.S. Government for him to dispel\r\n    illusions which might exercise a baneful influence on its\r\n    determination.\r\n\r\n    M. Mercier reports the conversation to-day to his Government. I\r\n    think it as well, at all events for the present, not to put it into\r\n    an official despatch, but it might perhaps be well that Lord Cowley\r\n    should know that I am disposed to speak in very high terms of the\r\n    moral support given to my demands by M. Mercier.\r\n\r\n    I am told that the Senate is still more angry about the combined\r\n    expedition against Mexico than about the _Trent_ affair. They will\r\n    hardly be so absurd as to manifest their displeasure in such a way\r\n    as to add France and Spain to their adversaries.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--I have kept M. Mercier _au courant_ of all my communications,\r\n    confidential as well as official, with Mr. Seward, but I have given\r\n    no information as to either to any one else.\r\n\r\nThere was now nothing to be done but to sit and wait for the American\r\nreply. It arrived on December 27, in the shape of a note from Mr. Seward\r\nof the most portentous length abounding in exuberant dialectics, but the\r\ngist of which was contained in the two following short paragraphs:--\r\n\r\n'The four persons in question are now held in military custody at Fort\r\nWarren in the State of Massachusetts. They will be cheerfully liberated.\r\n\r\n'Your lordship will please indicate a time and place for receiving\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\nThe question of peace or war had hung in the balance for weeks, but the\r\nvictory was complete, and British diplomacy achieved a success which was\r\nnot equalled until Fashoda supplied a somewhat similar case in 1897.\r\n\r\nSo far from being intoxicated with his remarkable triumph, as would have\r\nbeen the case with some diplomatists, Lord Lyons communicated the news\r\nto Lord Russell in matter-of-fact terms which were typical of his calm\r\nand practical nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Washington, Dec. 27, 1861.\r\n\r\n    It is of course impossible for me to give an opinion upon the\r\n    argumentation in Mr. Seward's voluminous note. Time barely admits of\r\n    its being read and copied before the messenger goes. But as the four\r\n    prisoners are given up, immediately and unconditionally, it is quite\r\n    clear to my mind that you will not wish me to decide the question\r\n    of peace or war without reference to you. A rupture of diplomatic\r\n    relations, not followed by war, would be worse than war itself, for\r\n    after that, nothing but actual hostilities would ever convince the\r\n    Americans that there was any limit to our forbearance.\r\n\r\n    I hope, however, that the Note will, on further examination, be\r\n    deemed sufficient. In that case it might not be unadvisable to give\r\n    credit to Mr. Seward, in speaking to Mr. Adams, and the more so\r\n    perhaps because Mr. Adams is, or at all events was, devoted to Mr.\r\n    Seward and his policy. I cannot say that my general opinion of Mr.\r\n    Seward has undergone any change; but without inquiring into his\r\n    motives, I must allow him the merit of having worked very hard and\r\n    exposed his popularity to very great danger.\r\n\r\n    I shall not be able to give you any information to-day as to the\r\n    effect produced upon the public. Mr. Seward has begged me to keep\r\n    the answer a secret until to-morrow. He intends to publish it in the\r\n    newspapers here to-morrow, and has sent a copy to New York to be\r\n    published simultaneously there. In the latter case it will be\r\n    conveyed to the public in Europe, as well as to you, by the same\r\n    packet which takes this letter. Mr. Seward told me he 'had been\r\n    through the fires of Tophet' in order to get the prisoners\r\n    surrendered.\r\n\r\n    I have seen with very great satisfaction that you have informed Mr.\r\n    Adams, in answer to the remonstrances about Mr. Bunch, that H.M.\r\n    Government must and will hold communication with the Confederate\r\n    Government. I am also extremely glad that the instructions to the\r\n    Consuls on the subject have been sent to the Admiral to forward, not\r\n    to me. In fact, if we are able to maintain peace with the U.S. it\r\n    will be very desirable to separate the Consuls in the South as much\r\n    as possible from this Legation. It will hardly be possible for me to\r\n    keep well with the Government here, if I am supposed to have the\r\n    direction of communication with the enemy's Government.\r\n\r\n    I think it very important, with a view to the preservation of peace,\r\n    that advantage should be taken of the opportunity to put Canada into\r\n    a state of defence; and indeed (as I said in a despatch which I\r\n    wrote in May last) to provide for the security of all our\r\n    possessions on both sides of this Continent. While Canada, in\r\n    particular, is apparently defenceless, the Americans will never\r\n    believe that we contemplate the possibility of war. And it must\r\n    never be forgotten that when they make peace with the South, they\r\n    may have a large army to provide with employment, and an immense\r\n    amount of popular dissatisfaction and humiliation to find a safety\r\n    valve for.\r\n\r\n    My intention is to propose to Mr. Seward that I shall send a\r\n    man-of-war or a British mail packet to Boston to receive the\r\n    prisoners. I should propose that they should go in the first\r\n    instance to Halifax. But I should suggest to the Captain to consult\r\n    their wishes as far as possible, but certainly _not_ to take them to\r\n    a Confederate port. Neither of the ships of war at New York would, I\r\n    suppose, be large enough to take them across the Atlantic, but I do\r\n    not think I ought to refuse to provide them with a passage to\r\n    Europe, if they ask for one. This seems due to them, inasmuch as it\r\n    was the failure of the British flag to afford them protection which\r\n    lost them their passage on board the _Trent_. Of course if they go\r\n    in a mail packet, I shall take precautions against any risk of an\r\n    'heroic' Captain applying the doctrines maintained here and bringing\r\n    the packet before an American Prize Court for adjudication. In any\r\n    case I shall give a caution to the Commander of the ship which takes\r\n    them, that they are not to be received with honours or treated\r\n    otherwise than as distinguished _private_ gentlemen.\r\n\r\n    Those who have not seen the Americans near, will probably be much\r\n    more surprised than I am at the surrender of the prisoners. I was\r\n    sure from the first that they would give in, if it were possible to\r\n    convince them that war was really the only alternative. My\r\n    difficulty has been to make them aware that it was surrender or war,\r\n    without making such threats as would render the humiliation too\r\n    great to be borne. This was the object of my confidential\r\n    communications with Mr. Seward before I gave him your despatch.\r\n\r\nThe main point having been gained, it remained to settle how the\r\nsurrender of the prisoners could best be carried out without causing\r\nunnecessary ill-feeling and arousing a popular agitation which might\r\ndrive the United States Government into committing some high-handed\r\naction in order to maintain itself. It was finally decided that, in\r\norder to avoid the trouble which Mr. Seward feared from the inhabitants\r\nof Boston, they should embark at Provincetown. They were accordingly\r\nconveyed in an American ship from Fort Warren to Provincetown, and there\r\nembarked on a British warship for Halifax, it having been expressly\r\nstipulated that the transfer should not take place at night. From\r\nHalifax they proceeded subsequently to Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Dec. 31, 1861.\r\n\r\n    The Americans are putting the best face they can upon the surrender\r\n    of Slidell and Mason, and as far as has depended upon me I have done\r\n    everything to make the pill as easy to swallow as possible. But I\r\n    cannot disguise from myself that the real cause of the yielding was\r\n    nothing more nor less than the military preparations made in\r\n    England. They are horribly out of humour and looking out for some\r\n    mode of annoying us without danger to themselves. There is a talk of\r\n    discriminative duties on British goods, of a non-intercourse Act,\r\n    and other absurdities. What is more serious is a proposal, which it\r\n    is said will be introduced into Congress next week, to repeal the\r\n    Act for carrying into effect the Reciprocity Treaty. This would be a\r\n    direct breach of the treaty, and would of course be an indisputable\r\n    _casus belli_. It has often been suggested before, in the old belief\r\n    that we should bear anything rather than go to war with the U.S. I\r\n    hope they have had a lesson which will make them wiser.\r\n\r\n    I cannot help fearing that it is as necessary as ever, nay more than\r\n    ever necessary, to be prepared to give a warm reception whether to\r\n    regular invaders or to filibusters from the U.S. who may make an\r\n    attempt upon Canada. In fact I am not reassured respecting the\r\n    maintenance of peace. For the present we have some security in Mr.\r\n    Seward. For he must do his best to maintain peace or he will have\r\n    made the sacrifice in the case of Mason and Slidell in vain. As in\r\n    that case, so in others, he sees now that besides the utter ruin of\r\n    the country, a war with us would give the ascendancy to the ultra\r\n    party who are opposed to him in the Cabinet and in Congress. He\r\n    fears too, and with great reason, that it would throw the country\r\n    into a state of anarchy, in which chiefs of a totally different\r\n    frame of mind from him would have the upper hand. But he may be\r\n    swept away, or, if he find it impossible to hold his position or his\r\n    own principles, turn round and play a desperate game with the\r\n    ultras. I have given him the opportunity of offering amends\r\n    spontaneously in three rather awkward matters, and, as you will see\r\n    by my despatches, he has been prompt in seizing it.\r\n\r\n    On reading his enormous note at leisure, I find that it is much more\r\n    of an apology than I thought from the hurried perusal which was all\r\n    I had time to give to it before I sent it off to you. But with your\r\n    letters before me, I should have taken much less _ad referendum_;\r\n    for the surrender of the prisoners is after all the main question.\r\n    On the other hand, I should not have gone out of my way to declare,\r\n    on my own responsibility, that the note was perfectly satisfactory,\r\n    unless it had contained a formal apology in plain words.\r\n\r\n    I have a better opinion of the Boston mob than Mr. Seward has, and\r\n    should have had very little fear of the prisoners being insulted, if\r\n    I had taken them from Fort Warren directly on board a British\r\n    man-of-war. I am not sorry however to spare the Bostonians (who are\r\n    among the most friendly to us of the Americans) what they might\r\n    consider a mortifying and humiliating spectacle. I have at Mr.\r\n    Seward's request not made the name of the place at which the\r\n    prisoners are to be transferred generally known. Indeed, I found\r\n    that many people were going to Boston to be present on the occasion,\r\n    and there is no advantage in having a crowd or a sensation about it.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to record that some of the American clergy showed a most\r\nunchristianlike spirit in connection with the termination of the _Trent_\r\ncase; the following remarkable prayer uttered in the Senate affording an\r\ninstructive example:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Thirty-Seventh Congress--Second Session.\r\n    In Senate--Monday, December 30, 1861.\r\n\r\n    [Prayer by Revd. Dr. Sunderland.]\r\n\r\n    O Thou, just Ruler of the world, in this hour of our trial, when\r\n    domestic treason stabs at the nation's heart, and foreign arrogance\r\n    is emboldened to defeat the public justice of the world, we ask help\r\n    of Thee for our rulers and our people, that we may patiently,\r\n    resolutely, and with one heart abide our time; for it is indeed a\r\n    day of darkness and reproach--a day when the high principle of human\r\n    equity, constrained by the remorseless sweep of physical and armed\r\n    force, must for the moment succumb under the plastic forms of soft\r\n    diplomacy. Yet, in the face of this, will we not be shaken in our\r\n    conviction that Thou art ever with him who, in the interest of human\r\n    liberty and the Christian faith, by all the means in his power works\r\n    righteousness and defends the truth.\r\n\r\n    O God, give to this our nation honesty, unity and courage; bring\r\n    this unnatural rebellion to a speedy end; and then prepare us to\r\n    assert upon a broader scale, and with a vaster force, the\r\n    inalienable rights and responsibilities of man: through Jesus\r\n    Christ. Amen.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, except for occasional manifestations of ill-humour, such\r\nas, for instance, a resolution in the House of Representatives in favour\r\nof creating a great navy to 'defend the seas from the sway of an\r\narbitrary trident,' the surrender was taken quietly, and Mr. Seward\r\nhandsomely acknowledged the great consideration which had been shown by\r\nLord Lyons in his conduct of the negotiations.\r\n\r\nCongratulations now began to pour in upon him, and Lord Russell wrote\r\nthat nothing could have been better than his conduct, and that his\r\npatience, forbearance, and friendly discretion had gone far to secure\r\nthe favourable result obtained. Another communication from Lord Russell\r\nintimated that the Queen, 'taking into consideration the judgment and\r\nconciliatory temper which you have shown in your negotiations at\r\nWashington, especially in regard to the _Trent_, has directed that you\r\nshould be raised to the rank of G.C.B.\r\n\r\nIn acknowledging these congratulations, Lord Lyons disclaimed having\r\nperformed any brilliant or striking service. The only merit which he\r\nattributed to himself was that of having laboured quietly and sedulously\r\nto smooth over difficulties and to carry out the instructions he\r\nreceived from the Foreign Office. Writing to Mr. Hammond, he explained\r\nthat he had resisted the temptation 'to do something' 'which always\r\nbesets one when one is anxious about a matter'; and that from the first\r\nhe had been convinced that the more quiet he kept the better would be\r\nthe chance of the instructions from home producing their effect. To\r\nother correspondents he expressed the view that it was the British\r\nmilitary preparations which had turned the scale in favour of peace.\r\n\r\nIt would, of course, be an exaggeration to attribute solely to Lord\r\nLyons the credit of having successfully prevented the calamity of a war\r\nbetween England and the United States. That credit is in reality due to\r\nothers as well as to himself: to the Home Government for their prompt\r\nand decisive precautions, to the Prince Consort for his timely\r\ninterposition, to the French Government for their loyal support at a\r\ncritical moment, and to the good sense eventually displayed by the\r\nAmericans themselves. But no one reading the _Trent_ correspondence can\r\nfail to realize that the issue of peace or war depended to a great\r\nextent upon the method in which the British representative at Washington\r\ncarried out his task, and that the slightest error in judgment on his\r\npart would have rendered the conflict inevitable.\r\n\r\nIn after years Lord Lyons frequently expressed the opinion that if there\r\nhad then been telegraphic communication across the Atlantic it would\r\nhave been impossible to avert war, and it is more than likely that he\r\nwas correct, although it is improbable that many people realized it at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nIt is also evident that a judicious silence may occasionally be of\r\ninestimable value. It not unfrequently happens that taciturnity is\r\nmistaken for profundity--\r\n\r\n    'O, my Antonio, I do know of those,\r\n    That therefore only are reported wise\r\n    For saying nothing.'\r\n\r\nand many a diplomatist and many a politician has gained a reputation for\r\nexcessive sagacity by possessing sufficient good sense to conceal his\r\nignorance by maintaining silence, but the restraint which enabled Lord\r\nLyons to refrain from saying a single word upon a question over which\r\nthe whole population of the United States was buzzing for six or seven\r\nweeks was little else than an inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCOURSE OF THE CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\n(1862-1865)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the immediate danger of war between England and America had at\r\nall events temporarily vanished, and the United States Government had\r\nput a good face upon the matter, it was only natural that a soreness\r\nshould remain; nor did the slowness of military operations tend to\r\nrestore that government to a more equable frame of mind. Much of the\r\nenthusiasm which marked the outbreak of hostilities had already\r\nevaporated, but the hatred of the South had continued to grow in\r\nintensity, and although the latter was undoubtedly suffering great\r\nhardships and privations, there was no sign of failing courage, and\r\nevery prospect of a long and bitter contest. The difficulty of finding\r\nmen for the Northern army continued to increase; the prospect of having\r\nto raise twenty or thirty millions sterling in taxes from a people\r\nunaccustomed to pay any apparent taxes at all for Federal purposes was\r\nparticularly unpleasant, more especially as there appeared to be no\r\nimmediate probability of a striking military success; and it was not\r\nsurprising that the country showed signs of great depression. Under\r\nthese circumstances, a marked division of parties in the North began to\r\nshow itself. One, which may be termed the Revolutionary Party, was in\r\nfavour of prosecuting the war at all hazards and by all means; of\r\nproclaiming the immediate abolition of slavery in the South; promoting a\r\nservile insurrection there; turning out the Cabinet, and even deposing\r\nthe President if he proved to be an obstacle; keeping Congress\r\npermanently in session to spur on the Government, and the Generals,\r\nmaintaining a paper currency by inflicting heavy penalties for\r\ndepreciating it, and so on. The Foreign Policy of this party consisted\r\nin a return to reckless conduct and language towards Europe in general,\r\nand an attempt to obtain the support of France against England.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, however, were now ranged the President, Mr. Seward,\r\nand the more moderate men. Mr. Seward had now, strange to say, become a\r\nkind of guarantee for peace, for after the concessions he had made, a\r\nforeign war would have been fatal to his reputation, and it was only\r\nfair to assume that his conversion to a more moderate course was\r\ngenuine. Still there was danger to England from both sides. If the party\r\nof violence should show itself reckless enough to risk anything, the\r\nmoderate party might conceivably provoke a foreign war either as an\r\nexcuse for giving up the contest with the South, or to divert popular\r\nirritation after having abandoned the contest as hopeless.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Seward's demeanour towards England had changed so much\r\nthat, early in 1862, his friendliness had become actually embarrassing.\r\nQuite a considerable force, according to British standards, amounting to\r\nsomething like 12,000 men, had been already despatched, or were under\r\norders to proceed to Canada, and Mr. Seward now made the surprising\r\noffer that these troops and stores should be landed at Portland, a port\r\nin the United States, and sent overland to Canada. However well meant\r\nthe invitation, it would manifestly have been most imprudent to accept\r\nit. It must have been plain to the densest understanding that these\r\ntroops and stores were only being sent to Canada in order that we might\r\nbe prepared, if unhappily a rupture should take place between England\r\nand the United States. Therefore, if troops and stores so conveyed were\r\neventually used against the United States, there would have been a\r\nviolent outcry of treachery against us throughout the country. The\r\ndanger, too, of some unpleasant incident occurring during the landing or\r\nduring the passage of the trains with which it would be impossible to\r\ndeal, was so obvious, that the invitation was declined with thanks. Too\r\nmuch love is sometimes almost more inconvenient in diplomacy than\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward's anxiety, at this time, however, to show himself a friend to\r\nEngland continued, and he took particular care to point out, in proof of\r\nhis new attitude, that up till the last moment (December 26) he had been\r\nthe only person in the Government who was in favour of the surrender of\r\nSlidell and Mason, and that President Lincoln had been opposed to\r\nsurrender and was in favour of arbitration only. In fact, Mr. Seward\r\nappeared to be seized with the desire of overwhelming not only England,\r\nbut France as well, with demonstrations of friendship and confidence,\r\nand it is perhaps not uncharitable to assume that two reasons were\r\ncontributory causes to this agreeable change of tactics. One of these\r\nwas that the appearance of a good understanding with these two Powers\r\nwould exercise a beneficial influence upon the money market; the other\r\nwas the fear of one or both of them recognizing the South and breaking\r\nup the blockade. Probably Mr. Seward's fears of French interference were\r\nincreased by a visit paid by M. Mercier, in the spring, to Richmond, the\r\nConfederate Headquarters. M. Mercier, whether instructed from home or\r\nnot, was bent upon this visit, which the United States Government could\r\nnot prevent, but which they could hardly be expected to view with\r\nfavour, and after the manner of French diplomatists of the period, he\r\nwas probably unable to resist the temptation of trying to effect a\r\nstriking _coup_, although there was not the slightest reason to suspect\r\nhim of any disloyalty to his English colleague. Lord Lyons wisely\r\ndeclined to accompany him, and prophesied that he would end by getting\r\ninto trouble, which proved to be the case, for the journey naturally\r\ngave rise to all sorts of comments. As will be seen from the following\r\nletter, both M. Mercier and Mr. Seward drew incorrect conclusions from\r\nthe information derived during this visit; the former being convinced\r\nthat the subjugation of the South was an impossibility, and the latter\r\nconfidently believing that the end of the war was close at hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n     Washington, April 23, 1862.\r\n\r\n    M. Mercier came back from Richmond yesterday. He went soon after his\r\n    arrival to see Mr. Seward and came afterwards to me. He is persuaded\r\n    that the confidence and the resolution of the Confederates are\r\n    increased rather than diminished by recent events. If they are\r\n    worsted anywhere they will still not surrender. They will destroy\r\n    their stores of cotton and tobacco, and all other property which\r\n    they cannot remove. They will retire into the interior of their\r\n    country and defy the North to follow them. They will endure any\r\n    privations and sufferings rather than be again united to the North.\r\n    Their unanimity and devotion to the cause are wonderful. They are\r\n    not carrying on a war in the usual manner for dominion as the North\r\n    is: they consider themselves to be fighting for their homes and\r\n    their liberty, and are making and are ready to make any sacrifices.\r\n\r\n    Such is the impression which M. Mercier says was made upon him by\r\n    what he saw and heard.\r\n\r\n    I asked him whether he had obtained any specific information as to\r\n    the extent of the naval and military resources of the Confederates.\r\n    He said that they admitted that they were in want of arms and\r\n    ammunition, and said that but for this they could keep a very much\r\n    larger army in the field. They had no difficulty about men. On the\r\n    contrary, they had more than they could arm. They had another\r\n    'Merrimac' nearly ready at Norfolk: they had an iron-plated vessel\r\n    on the James River: they had iron-plated vessels nearly ready at New\r\n    Orleans. If they lost New Orleans and all the seaboard, they would\r\n    be as far from being subdued as ever.\r\n\r\n    I inquired of M. Mercier whether he had entered upon any particular\r\n    matter of business with the members of the Confederate Government.\r\n    He said he had avoided the appearance of having come to transact\r\n    business: that the French tobacco would be spared if the rest was\r\n    burnt, provided it could be distinguished and separated from that\r\n    belonging to private persons.\r\n\r\n    I asked M. Mercier if anything had passed on the subject of the\r\n    position of the Consuls. He said that if the idea of calling upon\r\n    them to take out exequaturs from the Confederate Government had ever\r\n    been entertained, it was now abandoned; there appeared to be a very\r\n    good disposition towards foreigners in general; less good perhaps\r\n    towards the English as a nation than others, perhaps because more\r\n    had been expected from that country than from any other, and the\r\n    disappointment had consequently been greater. On the other hand, the\r\n    Confederate leaders professed to have abandoned all expectation of\r\n    succour from Europe: indeed, they declared that all they desired was\r\n    such an interruption of the blockade as would enable them to get\r\n    arms.\r\n\r\n    M. Mercier said that he was more than ever convinced that the\r\n    restoration of the old Union was impossible; that he believed the\r\n    war would, if the Powers of Europe exercised no influence upon it,\r\n    last for years; that he thought that in the end the independence of\r\n    the South must be recognized, and that the governments of Europe\r\n    should be on the watch for a favourable opportunity of doing this in\r\n    such a manner as to end the war. The present opportunity would,\r\n    however, he thought, be peculiarly unfavourable.\r\n\r\n    I did not express any opinion as to the policy to be eventually\r\n    pursued by France or England, but I entirely agreed with M. Mercier\r\n    that there was nothing to do at the present moment but watch events.\r\n\r\n    This morning Mr. Seward spoke to me about M. Mercier's journey. He\r\n    said that M. Mercier had, probably without being altogether aware of\r\n    it himself, obtained very valuable information for the U.S.\r\n    Government. He himself was quite convinced from M. Mercier's account\r\n    of what had passed, that the Confederates were about to make a last\r\n    effort: that they had their last armies in the field; and that their\r\n    last resources were brought into action. Their talking of retiring\r\n    into the interior was idle. If the U.S. were undisputed masters of\r\n    the border states, including Tennessee, and of the sea coast, there\r\n    would be no occasion for any further fighting. Anybody who liked to\r\n    retire into the interior was welcome to do so and stay there till he\r\n    was tired. Mr. Seward went on to say that he had had some difficulty\r\n    in preventing M. Mercier's journey making an unfavourable impression\r\n    upon the public. With this view he had caused it to be mentioned in\r\n    the papers that M. Mercier had had a long interview with him on his\r\n    return from Richmond; he had in the evening taken M. Mercier to the\r\n    President, which also he should put in the newspapers: to-night he\r\n    was to dine with M. Mercier to meet the captain of the French ship\r\n    of war which had brought M. Mercier back: to-morrow the President\r\n    would pay a visit to that ship.\r\n\r\n    I suppose the truth lies somewhere between M. Mercier's views of the\r\n    prospects of the South and Mr. Seward's. Mr. Seward was of course\r\n    anxious to weaken any impression M. Mercier's language may have made\r\n    upon me.\r\n\r\n    The Slave Trade Treaty has met with much more general approval than\r\n    I expected. It has excited quite an enthusiasm among the\r\n    Anti-Slavery party. I have never seen Mr. Seward apparently so much\r\n    pleased. Mr. Sumner, who has had the management of it in the Senate,\r\n    was moved to tears when he came to tell me that it had passed\r\n    unanimously.\r\n\r\nAs had been foreseen and pointed out to M. Mercier, the most\r\nunsatisfactory result of his visit was the impression it produced that\r\nFrance was disposed to act independently of England, but there is no\r\nevidence to show that such were the intentions of the French Government\r\nat the time, and M. Mercier himself always showed himself to be a most\r\nfrank and honest colleague.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, May 16, 1862.\r\n\r\n    The Government here is very much disquieted by the rumoured\r\n    intentions of England and France with regard to intervention. This\r\n    is not altogether without advantage, as they are more disposed to be\r\n    considerate, or, at all events, civil, when they have doubts about\r\n    us, than when they feel sure of us. They are more civil to France\r\n    than to England partly because they are more doubtful about her, and\r\n    partly because they never will have, do what she will, the same\r\n    bitterness against her as they have against England. Mr. Seward is\r\n    encouraged by some of his English correspondents to believe that the\r\n    Mexican affair will produce a serious disagreement between England\r\n    and France.\r\n\r\n    M. Mercier thinks it quite within the range of possibility that the\r\n    South may be victorious both in the battles in Virginia and in\r\n    Tennessee. He is at all events quite confident that whether\r\n    victorious or defeated they will not give in, and he is certainly\r\n    disposed to advise his Government to endeavour to put an end to the\r\n    war by intervening on the first opportunity. He is however very much\r\n    puzzled to devise any mode of intervention which would have the\r\n    effect of reviving French trade and obtaining cotton. I shall\r\n    suppose he would think it desirable to go to great lengths to stop\r\n    the war, because he believes that the South will not give in until\r\n    the whole country is made desolate, and that the North will very\r\n    soon be led to proclaim immediate emancipation, which would stop the\r\n    cultivation of cotton for an indefinite time.\r\n\r\n    I listen and say little when he talks of intervention. It appears to\r\n    me to be a dangerous subject of conversation. There is a good deal\r\n    of truth in M. Mercier's anticipations of evil, but I do not see my\r\n    way to doing any good.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The credit of the Government has been wonderfully kept up, but it\r\n    would not stand a considerable reverse in the field. It is possible\r\n    under such circumstances that a peace party might arise, and perhaps\r\n    just _possible_ that England and France might give weight to such a\r\n    party. However, all this is a mere speculation. We are (as usual) on\r\n    the eve of a crisis which is to clear up everything.\r\n\r\nA threatened breakdown in health, due chiefly to overwork, forced Lord\r\nLyons reluctantly to apply for leave to return to England before the\r\nsevere heat of a Washington summer had set in, and in making the\r\napplication he pointed out that during the three years which had elapsed\r\nsince his arrival in the United States he had only been absent for four\r\nnights from Washington, with the exception of the two months during\r\nwhich he was officially in attendance on the Prince of Wales. The work\r\nin fact was incessant, the staff of the Legation scanty, and things were\r\nnot made easier by the autocratic Hammond, who suddenly recalled one of\r\nthe attachés to London, that enlightened bureaucrat being apparently\r\nquite incapable of realizing that a young man's time might be more\r\nprofitably employed at Washington during the Civil War than in preparing\r\nfor some perfunctory and trumpery examination which could perfectly well\r\nhave been undertaken at any subsequent period. The appeals to the\r\nautocrat of the Foreign Office for assistance are as pathetic as they\r\nare moderate. 'I conjure you to send me out two or at least one good\r\nworking attaché as soon as possible. Brodie is completely out of health;\r\nWarre is always prostrated by the abominable heat of this place; Monson\r\ncan do a great deal, but his constitution is not of iron; and as for\r\nmyself I cannot do much Chancery work in addition to my proper duties.\r\nIndeed, I shall soon break down. What you see of our work gives a very\r\nsmall idea of the amount of it. It seems to me that everybody North and\r\nSouth who gets into trouble discovers that he or she is a\r\nnon-naturalized British subject.'\r\n\r\nNor were any high qualifications demanded. Geniuses were not in request.\r\n'What we want is a good steady industrious copier, _well conducted in\r\nprivate life_. I have no objection to quite a young one; such a man as\r\nJenner would suit me perfectly. Anderson, Monson, and I are all\r\nsufficiently well up in ordinary Chancery management to make it\r\nunnecessary to have more genius or more experience than is required for\r\ncopying.'\r\n\r\nWriting to his old chief Lord Normanby, the confession is made that\r\nWashington 'is a terrible place for young men; nothing whatever in the\r\nshape of amusement for them, little or no society of any kind now; no\r\ntheatre, no club. I have no time to think whether I am amused or not.'\r\n\r\nBeing constitutionally incapable of exaggeration, this last statement\r\nmay be accepted as literally accurate.\r\n\r\nLeave for three months having been granted, the sanguine Mr. Seward did\r\nnot fail to draw hopeful conclusions from the circumstance, and there\r\nappeared to be no sign of immediate trouble in the near future.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, June 9, 1862.\r\n\r\n    I was so unwell yesterday that I was unable to do anything, which\r\n    has prevented my sending you by this mail some general information\r\n    on the prospects of the war and some other matters.\r\n\r\n    I did not think that Mr. Seward would object to my going. He has, in\r\n    fact, taken up the idea with so much enthusiasm that I have been\r\n    obliged to endeavour to check his anticipation of the wonders I am\r\n    to effect, or rather to make him understand that my own views, not\r\n    his, are those which I must express to you.\r\n\r\n    I take his willingness that I should go as a sign that he does not\r\n    expect serious trouble, for I think that he would rather be in my\r\n    hands than those of a man new to him if he did.\r\n\r\n    I am afraid that there are three things to which we must not blind\r\n    ourselves:\r\n\r\n    1. That we have a very small chance of getting cotton from this\r\n    country for a long time to come.\r\n\r\n    2. That there is no Union feeling in the South.\r\n\r\n    3. That the war has become one of separation or subjugation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, June 13, 1862.\r\n\r\n    I had quite an affectionate parting with the President this morning.\r\n    He told, as is his wont, a number of stories more or less decorous,\r\n    but all he said having any bearing on political matters was: 'I\r\n    suppose my position makes people in England think a great deal more\r\n    of me than I deserve, pray tell 'em that I mean 'em no harm.' He\r\n    does not pay much attention to foreign affairs, and I suppose did\r\n    not like to talk about them without Mr. Seward. I am to hear Mr.\r\n    Seward's last words at New York on Tuesday evening. I embark the\r\n    following morning, and hope to pay my respects to you in person a\r\n    few days after this letter reaches you.\r\n\r\n    It is quite time for me to get away from this place. The heat to-day\r\n    is overpowering.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons arrived in London about the end of June, and a letter to Mr.\r\nStuart who had been left in charge of the Legation at Washington shows\r\nthat he was considerably alarmed at the hostile feeling prevailing\r\nthroughout the country against the North, largely due to the inability\r\nto obtain cotton, but also embittered by the tone of the American press.\r\nAs an instance of this feeling, alluding to the rumour that McClellan\r\nhad suffered a serious defeat, he adds: 'I am afraid no one but me is\r\nsorry for it.' McClellan's misfortunes certainly provoked demonstrations\r\nof pleasure in the House of Commons during an ill-timed debate which\r\ntook place in July, and a celebrated speech by Gladstone in which he\r\nasserted that 'Jefferson Davies and the leaders of the South have made\r\nan army; they are making, it appears, a navy; and they have made, what\r\nis more than either--they have made a nation,' certainly tended to show\r\nthat however impartial the Cabinet intended to be, the sympathies of\r\nEngland were to a great extent with the South.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in England he was in constant communication with the\r\nCabinet, and the general belief of ministers was that whilst extremely\r\nreluctant to interfere in any way in the American contest, interference\r\nmight be forced upon them. Mediation was again in the air, and M.\r\nMercier and the French Government thought that an opportunity had\r\narrived for proposing it.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons, after having been detained by Lord Russell for the purpose\r\nof additional consultations, set out again for Washington in October\r\naccompanied by the late Sir Edward Malet, who remained for a\r\nconsiderable period on his staff, and became one of his closest friends.\r\nIn fact, with the exception of the late Mr. George Sheffield, who was\r\nalready acting as his private secretary, and of the late Sir Michael\r\nHubert, who subsequently acted in the same capacity, it is doubtful\r\nwhether any other person of his acquaintance ever reached the same\r\ndegree of intimacy or shared his confidence to an equal extent.\r\n\r\nThe visit to England had in no sense changed the policy of the British\r\nGovernment towards the United States, and there were no fresh\r\ninstructions with regard to mediation, intervention, recognition of the\r\nSouth, and the numerous other matters which occupied attention. Nor had\r\nany essential change taken place in the situation in America, and Lord\r\nLyons, immediately after his return expressed the opinion that foreign\r\nintervention, short of the use of force, would only make matters worse.\r\nThe indefatigable M. Mercier, however, in whose thoughts intervention\r\nwas always uppermost, was full of a new plan, although, with the violent\r\nparty predominant in the Cabinet, the moment did not appear propitious.\r\nM. Mercier's idea was that France, with the consent and support of\r\nEngland, should offer mediation alone. He thought that the difficulty\r\nwhich the irritation against England threw in the way of mediation might\r\nthus be avoided, while the fact of England supporting France would give\r\nto France the weight of both Powers. According to his information,\r\nRussia, probably from a desire to separate France and England, was\r\ndisposed to join France in offering good offices, but, independently of\r\nother considerations, the presence of Russia might be an obstacle to the\r\nsuccess of his plan. It would take away from the offer of mediation the\r\nelement of intimidation, which, though kept in the background, must be\r\nfelt by the United States to exist. The mediation of all the European\r\nPowers (France, England, Russia, and perhaps Prussia) would be a\r\ndifferent matter. It might have the effect of reconciling the pride of\r\nthe United States to negotiation with the South, and might, in certain\r\nconjunctions, be usefully employed. But it would be more easy for the\r\nGovernment of the United States to reject an offer from the four Powers\r\nthan from England and France, or from France only. England and France\r\nhad an obvious and pressing interest in putting an end to hostilities\r\nand the means of supporting their counsels by their navies.\r\n\r\nSuch was M. Mercier's plan, but he received little encouragement from\r\nhis British colleague, who had anticipated something of the kind, and\r\nwith habitual caution declined to pronounce any opinion until he had\r\nreceived instructions from home. As a matter of fact, he had foreseen\r\nthis proposal when in England, and had obtained an assurance from Lord\r\nRussell that it should be discussed by the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe two following letters from Lord Russell to Lord Lyons show that\r\nM. Mercier was really in accordance with his own Government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Woburn Abbey, Nov. 1, 1862.\r\n\r\n    The Emperor of the French wishes to offer peace to both parties, and\r\n    he says both parties will agree to peace, the one on the ground of\r\n    Union and the other on the ground of Separation! I fear we are no\r\n    nearer to peace, if so near, as we were a year ago.\r\n\r\n    Seward's avowal to Mr. Stuart that he looks to mutual extermination\r\n    and the superior numbers of the North, in order to restore the\r\n    Union!!! is the most horrible thing I ever heard.\r\n\r\n    Cobden, I fear, is right when he says that to preach peace to them\r\n    is like speaking to mad dogs. I am much less sanguine than I was,\r\n    but I shall be glad to hear your views on your return. Russia must\r\n    be a party to any thing done by us and France--if we do anything.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Woburn Abbey, Nov. 8, 1862.\r\n\r\n    Flahault has been instructed to propose to us in conjunction with\r\n    Russia to ask North and South to suspend their war for six months. I\r\n    have not seen the despatch.\r\n\r\n    We shall consider our answer on Tuesday next.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's proposal was declined by the British Government, and at\r\nfirst peremptorily declined also by the Russian Government, but as soon\r\nas the latter perceived, by a speech made by Lord Palmerston at the\r\nGuildhall, that there was no chance of an acceptance of the proposal by\r\nEngland a circular was issued, stating that if France persisted in her\r\nintention, the Russian Minister at Washington would be instructed to\r\ngive it moral if not official support. Thus, as on many other occasions,\r\ndid Louis Napoleon's elaborate scheme vanish into space.\r\n\r\nOne fresh difficulty which had arisen in the meantime was the diminished\r\ninfluence of Mr. Seward with the President and his ministers. He\r\nhad become much more conciliatory in his dealings with foreign\r\nrepresentatives, but was apparently unable to carry his points with\r\nother departments, and had fallen in public estimation by signing the\r\nAbolition Proclamation which had been imposed upon him, in opposition to\r\nall his views by the Radical party in the Cabinet. Towards the end of\r\nthe year it seemed quite probable that he would have to resign, and the\r\ncontingency was viewed with consternation, for although Mr. Seward had\r\nvery pronounced faults, he now represented the Moderate party, and his\r\ndeparture would signify the surrender of President Lincoln to the Ultra\r\nRadical party, prepared to risk everything, even to a foreign war, in\r\norder to maintain itself in power.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, there was every excuse for dissatisfaction with their\r\nGovernment on the part of the Northern public. After about two years'\r\nfighting the two main armies of the North and South remained in much the\r\nsame position, but, if anything, the balance of gain appeared to rest\r\nwith the South. New Orleans, it is true, had been captured, but the\r\ninvasion of Virginia had failed, and Richmond was as unapproachable as\r\never. The North were the attacking party, and if they failed to advance\r\nit was equivalent to a defeat. Disappointment and discouragement had\r\nsucceeded to confidence and enthusiasm, and if the contest imposed much\r\nseverer hardships upon the Confederates than upon their opponents, there\r\nwas no sign of faltering, and their spirit remained as high as ever.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of 1862 the prices of ordinary articles in the\r\nConfederate States had already greatly increased. As early as October,\r\naccording to the consular reports, the price of tea at Savannah was\r\nsixteen dollars a pound; brown sugar sixty cents; loaf sugar\r\nunobtainable, and the commonest brown soap seventy-five cents. At\r\nCharleston, coal was unprocurable; black cloth fetched fifty-three\r\ndollars a yard; shoes cost thirty-four dollars a pair; beer thirty\r\ndollars a dozen; sugar a dollar a pound; butter a dollar and a half, and\r\nthe pound sterling was worth fourteen dollars. In view of these figures\r\nit would be interesting to learn the cost of a banquet given by General\r\nRipley in December 1862, to some French officers at Charleston, at which\r\nConsul Bunch, of revoked exequatur fame, was present, and which must\r\nsurely have been the most sumptuous meal ever partaken of in a besieged\r\ntown since the days of Belshazzar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    BILL OF FARE.\r\n\r\n    Oysters on Shell.\r\n\r\n    FISH.\r\n    Salmon, Anchovy sauce.\r\n\r\n    SOUP.\r\n    Green Turtle.

In September, 1862, Lincoln had issued the\r\npreliminary proclamation of Emancipation, but the hope that it would\r\nconsolidate the North had not been realized. The second proclamation\r\nappeared on January 1, 1863, and had no greater success, serving only to\r\nexasperate the South still further and increasing the divisions in the\r\nNorth. The Democratic party was afraid to declare openly for peace, but\r\ndisguised efforts in favour of it were now made, and it was sought to\r\ninduce some of the State Legislatures to pass resolutions in favour of\r\nan armistice and a convention. Men of all shades of politics had lost\r\nheart, but the most probable cause of peace seemed to be the\r\nimpossibility of raising or keeping together a great army unless the\r\nnational spirit could be raised by some striking military successes,\r\nmeanwhile the division of feeling in the North had reached such a\r\npitch that the patriots who had formerly clamoured for a foreign war to\r\nreunite North and South were now calling for a foreign war to reunite\r\nthe North itself.\r\n\r\nThe general demoralization induced M. Mercier to make yet another\r\nattempt at mediation. Upon this occasion he was approached by the\r\nwell-known journalist, Mr. Horace Greeley, whose object it was to\r\nascertain whether the Emperor Napoleon could be relied upon as a real\r\nfriend to the United States in case of his being accepted as a mediator,\r\na 'real friend,' meaning, of course, one who would insist upon the\r\nrestoration of the Union. M. Mercier's fresh attempt met with no greater\r\nsuccess than before, nor was it surprising, for his action was based\r\nupon an entire misconception.\r\n\r\nBeing firmly convinced that the restoration of the Union was impossible,\r\nhe failed to realize that this must be the basis of all negotiations,\r\nand although most people were heartily sick of the war and were not\r\nprepared to refuse to the South all terms short of unconditional\r\nsurrender, they had not been brought to the point of acquiescing in a\r\ncession of territory.\r\n\r\nThe French proposal, with which we had been careful not to associate\r\nourselves, was, of course, declined by the American Government. Mr.\r\nSeward re-established some of his popularity by the character of his\r\nanswer; distrust of the Emperor Napoleon increased, and the only party\r\nwhich benefited in any way was England, for the increase in ill-feeling\r\ntowards France had the result of diminishing to some extent the\r\nanimosity against us, and M. Mercier himself was now almost as much\r\nattacked in the press as the British Minister had been in the past.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year, an incident occurred which might have had unpleasant\r\nconsequences had it not been promptly dealt with. In spite of the\r\nendless embarrassments created by the blockade, the British Government\r\nwas sincerely anxious not to give the United States Government any\r\nground for complaint, and the Consuls had been continually enjoined by\r\nLord Lyons to adhere closely to the recognized rules of International\r\nLaw where a state of blockade existed. To his consternation he now\r\nlearnt that the Consul at Mobile proposed to send away from that port a\r\nquantity of specie in a British man-of-war. 'I should be very much\r\nalarmed,' he wrote, 'if I thought it likely that he would find a captain\r\nof man-of-war as foolish as himself. I really could not answer for peace\r\nif, in addition to the irritation about the _Alabama_, should come the\r\nfury which would be excited, if it were shown that our men-of-war had\r\ncarried Confederate gold through the blockade. No proof that the money\r\nwas intended for, or even that it had been actually paid to, British\r\nbondholders would ever convince people here that it had not been used to\r\npurchase munitions of war.' Unfortunately a simple-minded captain had\r\nbeen discovered by the Consul, and before it was possible to communicate\r\nwith him the specie had been shipped. This action, which was due solely\r\nto stupidity, was impossible to defend, and would have provided the\r\nAmerican Government with a first-class grievance; clearly the best thing\r\nto do was to anticipate any complaints, and consequently the Consul was\r\nwisely dismissed before the matter became really public. The promptitude\r\nwith which this regrettable incident was dealt with contrasts favourably\r\nwith the difficulty which was experienced in persuading the American\r\nGovernment to deal adequately with grievances arising out of the\r\nproceedings of their own officials.\r\n\r\nAt this period of the war innumerable complaints were received from\r\nBritish Governors, Naval officers and Consuls with regard to the\r\narbitrary proceedings of United States cruisers, and it was plain that\r\nthese proceedings were largely due to the exasperation caused by the\r\nexploits of the _Alabama_, and by the rumours that similar vessels were\r\nbeing built in England for the Confederates. This exasperation was\r\nperfectly natural, but not altogether reasonable, for it never seems to\r\nhave occurred to the Americans that the fault lay partly with their own\r\nNavy. Great pressure was put upon President Lincoln to issue letters of\r\nmarque, and had privateers made their appearance and exercised\r\nbelligerent rights against neutral merchantmen, the difficulty of\r\npreserving peace would have been increased tenfold. Mr. Seward was known\r\nto be strongly in favour of the policy of issuing letters of marque, and\r\nthe matter was brought to the attention of Mr. Adams by Lord Russell,\r\nwho always appeared somewhat unnecessarily disposed to suspect Mr.\r\nSeward of hostile intentions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Chesham Place, March 14, 1863.\r\n\r\n    I don't think Mr. Seward means to quarrel with us, but perhaps he\r\n    will bluster rather more when he has lost the support of Congress.\r\n\r\n    Adams told me that the privateers, if sanctioned at all, were not\r\n    intended to interfere with nice questions of International Law, but\r\n    only to encounter the _Alabama_ and other vessels of that sort.\r\n    If this be so I doubt if they will be fitted out at all, but if\r\n    they are fitted out I think they will not keep their hands off\r\n    English merchant ships.\r\n\r\n    We have no thoughts of recognizing at present. If you are asked our\r\n    intentions by Seward, say that our opinion is that the Republican\r\n    Party ought not to leave the glorious work of peace to the\r\n    Democrats, but as a Neutral Power, our intention and wish is to let\r\n    the war work itself out, as it is sure to do by the moral exhaustion\r\n    of the war spirit.\r\n\r\n    Our procession and wedding went off splendidly. The Princess of\r\n    Wales is charming and would make New York stand on tiptoe to behold\r\n    her.\r\n\r\nIn a further conversation with Mr. Adams he made the significant remarks\r\nthat if the contemplated privateers sought for Confederate merchant\r\nships they would not find any, and that if they interfered with neutral\r\nvessels and the law of blockade they would probably involve their own\r\nand the British Government in 'very awkward questions.'\r\n\r\nLord Russell, in spite of his sincere and often proclaimed desire to\r\nremain absolutely impartial, hardly seems at this time to have realized\r\nthe disastrous consequences of not having prevented the departure of the\r\n_Alabama_ and similar vessels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, March 28, 1863.\r\n\r\n    The outcry in America about the _Oreto_ and the _Alabama_ is much\r\n    exaggerated, but I must feel that her roaming the ocean with English\r\n    guns and English sailors to burn, sink and destroy the ships of a\r\n    friendly nation, is a scandal and a reproach. I don't know very well\r\n    what we can do, but I should like myself to refer the question of\r\n    indemnity to an impartial arbiter.\r\n\r\n    When things are more advanced towards a termination, I think this\r\n    might be done. It would be dangerous to do it at present, or even\r\n    to hold out hopes of it. I will think further of it, and if I remain\r\n    in the same mind, will submit the question to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\n    The _Peterhoff_ and the _Magicienne_ are now before the Law\r\n    Officers. I will send you instructions about them next week. The\r\n    seizures by Admiral Wilkes seem like a plan to embroil our two\r\n    countries. He always protests that such is not his object, but his\r\n    acts do not agree with his words.\r\n\r\n    I should like anything better than being obliged to take the part of\r\n    the Confederates. But then President Lincoln must not be getting up\r\n    war cries to help his declining popularity.\r\n\r\nThe two vessels alluded to had been captured on their way to Matamoros,\r\nin Mexican territory, and the British Government contended that the\r\ntraffic to that place was legitimate, while the United States Government\r\nmaintained, probably with justice, that the goods were intended for\r\nTexas. Matamoros, which was situated on the Rio Grande, separating\r\nMexico from the United States, sprang into prominence in 1862 in\r\nconsequence of the war, became the seat of a brisk trade, and provided\r\none of the numerous difficulties arising out of the blockade, which had\r\nnow been greatly extended owing to the rapid development of the Federal\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\nAs for Admiral Wilkes, the hero of the _Trent_, his arbitrary conduct\r\nwas the subject of continual complaints; he showed marked discourtesy in\r\nconnection with H.M.S. _Barracouta_, and upon one occasion a cruiser\r\nunder his command went so far as to fire a shot across the bows of\r\nH.M.S. _Cygnet_, and as the long-suffering British Admiral Sir A. Milne\r\nobserved, to fire a shot across the bows of a neutral ship of war when\r\nhove to, was going a step further in the already uncourteous proceedings\r\nof the American cruisers. Admiral Wilkes always disclaimed any\r\nintention of unfriendliness, but his proceedings were a fruitful source\r\nof irritation, and Lord Russell certainly conceived the impression that\r\nhe and his official chief, Mr. Welles, were bent upon picking a quarrel\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nFeeling between the two countries was not improved by the inopportune\r\npublication of a Blue Book. The Democrats, who had been faring badly, by\r\nsome mysterious process of reasoning, came to the conclusion that the\r\nobject was to destroy them and denounced Lord Russell for having lost\r\nthem an election in Connecticut by his Machiavellian proceedings. They\r\nvented their indignation upon the Legation at Washington, and the\r\nposition of the minister became more and more unpleasant, added to which\r\nhis health again showed signs of giving way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, April 13, 1863.\r\n\r\n    I have written as much as I have time and strength for officially. I\r\n    have been unwell all the last week, but not seriously so. I think\r\n    the state of things here, as far as peace with us is concerned, more\r\n    alarming than it has been since the Trent affair. They are not a\r\n    people who can be soothed by concessions, and they are a people who\r\n    after any amount of bluster will give in if they think that their\r\n    opponents are in earnest and are stronger than they. I would rather\r\n    the quarrel came, if come it must, upon some better ground for us\r\n    than the question of the ships fitted out for the Confederates. The\r\n    great point to be gained, in my opinion, would be to prevent the\r\n    ships sailing, without leading the people here to think that they\r\n    had gained their point by threats. I am in trouble altogether, for\r\n    the good will to me personally, which had miraculously survived so\r\n    long, seems at last to have sunk altogether under the stroke of the\r\n    last Blue Book.\r\n\r\nIt must have been peculiarly irritating, after all the efforts he had\r\nmade, to find them neutralized by the clumsy action of the Home\r\nGovernment, but in his private correspondence there occur no expressions\r\nof resentment against those who had thus weakened his position, probably\r\nbecause his sense of discipline and loyalty to his official chiefs was\r\nso strong as to preclude anything in the nature of criticism. It is\r\ncustomary, before publishing Blue Books on Foreign Affairs, to consult\r\nboth the Foreign Government concerned and the British representative\r\naccredited to it, but presumably in this case the usual practice was not\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn one direction, however, there was an improvement. The British\r\nGovernment tardily realizing the danger arising from the building of\r\nConfederate cruisers in England took steps to prevent it, and the\r\nsituation was eased for the time being.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, April 24, 1863.\r\n\r\n    So far as I can judge in this short time the Americans have eagerly\r\n    grasped at the intelligence of the endeavours to stop the\r\n    Confederate vessels building in England, as a relief from their\r\n    dread that they were really drifting into a war with us. I cannot\r\n    yet say whether the exasperation is subsiding. I have not much fear\r\n    that they will ever put a _casus belli_ to us, but I do fear that\r\n    they may force us to make demands upon them to which, however\r\n    plainly just, party considerations may render it difficult for the\r\n    administration to yield. I seem to be getting on pretty well again\r\n    with Mr. Seward, but not with others since the Blue Book, and Mr.\r\n    Seward cannot control the feelings or the actions of the other\r\n    members of the administration either as regards England or her\r\n    Representative here personally. However, for the moment, things\r\n    certainly look more peaceful than they did a week ago. I mean\r\n    peaceful towards us, for there are no symptoms of an approaching end\r\n    of the civil war.\r\n\r\nOne danger at any rate was removed, at all events temporarily, for the\r\nAmerican Government determined not to proceed with the issuing of the\r\nletters of marque. The chief danger, however, lay not so much in the\r\nexasperation caused by the Confederate ships as in the proceedings of\r\nthe United States cruisers, and it was feared that a repetition of such\r\nseizures as those of the _Peterhoff_ and _Magicienne_ might rouse such a\r\nfeeling of indignation in England that it might become necessary to put\r\nforward demands for redress which the Americans would be too angry to\r\ncomply with. For some reason, too, the relations between the British\r\nLegation and the Navy Department (perhaps owing to Mr. Welles's\r\nanti-English proclivities), were much less satisfactory than was the\r\ncase with the other Government offices, and whenever an American naval\r\nofficer had been admittedly in the wrong, explanation, regret, or\r\nredress were generally postponed so long (as in the case of the _Trent_)\r\nthat the United States Government found itself in the position of having\r\neither to make a marked concession to England, or to run the risk of\r\nrefusing just demands. Lord Lyons's usual practice was to leave the door\r\nopen for spontaneous action on their part up to the last moment, and to\r\nabstain from making anything like a demand or even an embarrassing\r\nobservation for as long as possible; but his difficulties in dealing\r\nwith such questions were increased by a quarrel between Mr. Seward and\r\nMr. Welles. Mr. Seward, to do him justice, generally seems to have\r\nexercised a pacific influence, but party spirit ran so high, and the\r\nDemocrats detested him so cordially, that even those who were known\r\nto be friendly towards England could not resist the temptation of\r\ndenouncing his 'humiliating concessions to British arrogance' when\r\nthey got the opportunity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Admiral Sir A. Milne._\r\n\r\n    Washington, May 11, 1863.\r\n\r\n    I have given Mr. Seward verbally a warning from H.M. Government that\r\n    the impression which prevails in England that the United States are\r\n    systematically endeavouring by fair means and by foul to stop our\r\n    trade with Matamoros is producing very dangerous effects. Mr. Seward\r\n    said that he should be able to give very satisfactory assurances on\r\n    this head. I observed to him that I thought some decided practical\r\n    steps were necessary to do away with this impression. I reminded him\r\n    of his previous assurances and of his instructions to the Navy\r\n    Department, and pointed out those instructions were apparently set\r\n    at nought by the U.S. officers. I said that the great point was to\r\n    make the subordinate officers feel the effects of the displeasure of\r\n    the Government, when they violated neutral rights; that it was not\r\n    likely the naval officers would pay much attention to the assurances\r\n    given by the Government to Foreign Powers, and that it was not to be\r\n    expected that they would pay much attention to formal instructions\r\n    to themselves, if they found that they could practically violate\r\n    them with impunity. The Government ought, I said, to remove its\r\n    subordinates from situations in which they were peculiarly exposed\r\n    to temptations to make an unlawful use of belligerent powers. I told\r\n    Mr. Seward that I should regard another questionable seizure of a\r\n    British merchant vessel in the neighbourhood of St. Thomas, or\r\n    another questionable seizure anywhere of a British vessel bound to\r\n    Matamoros, as little less than a calamity.\r\n\r\n    I trust that I made so much impression as to render it probable that\r\n    these matters will be arranged for the present, as far as _words_\r\n    go, and that something will be done to check the vexatious\r\n    proceedings of the cruisers. What this Government ought to do is to\r\n    remove their ships from St. Thomas altogether and recall Admiral\r\n    Wilkes. I have not however much confidence in their doing anything\r\n    really effectual. Many of the naval officers would like a war with\r\n    England. They know well enough that it would not be a naval war, but\r\n    they are envious of Captain Semmes and the _Alabama_, and would\r\n    rather roam about picking up prizes, than go on with the dull and\r\n    harassing work of blockading. Then the universal exasperation in the\r\n    country against England makes the Government unwilling and afraid to\r\n    do anything which looks like a concession to us. Thus things are in\r\n    a dangerous state, and it will be a great comfort to me to be within\r\n    reach of you by telegraph.\r\n\r\n    If any more privateers get out of our ports, the Government here may\r\n    be forced by public clamour to issue letters of marque somewhat\r\n    suddenly. Mr. Seward has verbally promised to give us notice, but\r\n    this is a very vague assurance: of course it will not do for me to\r\n    discuss beforehand any particular arrangements about them, because\r\n    this would imply acquiescence in their being issued, which we are\r\n    far from wishing to signify beforehand.\r\n\r\n    I have been unwell for more than a month, and am beset by a quantity\r\n    of small vexatious business concerning the wrongs of British\r\n    subjects who have suddenly proclaimed their unswerving loyalty to\r\n    the British Crown and demanded my protection.\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for your private letter. You will think that I am trying\r\n    to make up for the quality of my information by quantity of writing.\r\n    The fact is I am too much knocked up to be able to write shortly.\r\n\r\nThe representations made with regard to Admiral Wilkes, partly owing to\r\nthe good offices of Mr. Seward, at length produced a satisfactory\r\nresult, and that enterprising officer was promoted to a command in the\r\nPacific, much doubtless to the relief of all concerned. Lord Lyons was\r\nextremely careful to conceal the fact that he had been in any way\r\ninstrumental in obtaining this transfer, and congratulated himself upon\r\nthe advent of a temporary lull in the storm against England: a lull,\r\nhowever, which the escape of another _Alabama_ from Liverpool, of a\r\nconsiderable Federal success or even a mere accident, might convert into\r\nan even more furious tempest.\r\n\r\nTwo years previously Mr. Seward had announced that the policy of the\r\nUnited States, unlike that of other countries, was 'based on high and\r\neternal consideration of principle and the good of the human race,' but\r\naliens resident in America, and more especially Englishmen, might have\r\nbeen excused for complaining that this lofty and inspiring ideal was\r\naccompanied by a vast amount of inconvenience and hardship.\r\n\r\nForeigners who have taken up their abode in a country where a state of\r\nwar prevails are naturally subjected to much that is objectionable to\r\nthem, in the natural course of things, and as a general rule find it\r\nextremely difficult to obtain redress, for whilst they remain in a\r\ncountry which is not their own they must submit to any exceptional\r\nlegislation which the force of circumstances may require. Foreign\r\nGovernments are not in a position to decide whether this exceptional\r\nlegislation is justifiable or not, and the utmost that the alien can\r\nexpect is, either that he should be allowed time to depart, or that his\r\nGovernment should protect him by remonstrance or otherwise when he is\r\ndealt with illegally; and the general principle which is usually adopted\r\nis that foreign interference should be as sparing as possible and that\r\nthe foreigner should take his chance with the native citizen.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before foreigners in the United States were made to\r\nrealize the disadvantages of living in a country where civil war\r\nprevailed. When hostilities began, the Government, reasonably enough,\r\ntook steps to suspend when necessary the ordinary law, that being a\r\npractice almost invariably adopted by civilized countries under similar\r\ncircumstances. Persons suspected of disaffection or treason were\r\narbitrarily arrested, kept in prison under the authority of the\r\nmilitary, and detained there without trial; and amongst these were\r\noccasionally _bonâ fide_ British subjects and others who claimed to\r\nbe such. Where martial law exists, it is only natural that occasional\r\ncases of injustice or harshness should arise, and it is clear that a\r\ncertain number of British subjects suffered without due cause, but upon\r\nthe whole it does not appear the United States Government exercised its\r\npowers with undue severity, or that it acted in a more arbitrary manner\r\nthan would have been the case with a European Power in a similar\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1862, nearly all political prisoners, other than spies,\r\nwere ordered to be released on parole, and in April Lord Lyons was able\r\nto report that although the Executive Government retained the power to\r\nmake political arrests it was rarely exercised. He stated that he was\r\nnot aware of any British subject being detained arbitrarily as a\r\npolitical prisoner, and that although arrests without form of law were\r\nstill being made by the military authorities in places occupied by the\r\nforces of the United States, they appeared to be confined in general to\r\npersons accused of offences affecting, more or less, the discipline or\r\nsafety of the army.\r\n\r\nAs was only to be expected, there were an enormous number of\r\napplications made to the Legation by persons who were aggrieved by the\r\noperation of martial law, but what gave far more trouble was the attempt\r\nof the United States Government to exact military service from resident\r\nBritish subjects.\r\n\r\nThe established principle is that resident aliens, in return for the\r\nenjoyment of ordinary civil rights, should be liable to discharge\r\ncertain duties in connection with the administration of justice and the\r\nmaintenance of order, and that in certain cases they may reasonably be\r\ncalled upon to take part in the defence of the country against invasion.\r\nOn the other hand, the incorporation of aliens in the regular army or\r\nnavy is manifestly unjust, for it prevents departure from the country\r\nand might conceivably incur the obligation of having to fight against\r\ntheir own countrymen. This, it is true, is not applicable to a civil\r\nwar, but an alien might well argue that a civil war, waged between\r\ncitizens for an object in which he, as an alien, had no concern, was a\r\ntotally insufficient reason for dragging him into the contest. It is\r\ndifficult to believe, for instance, that the United States Government\r\nwould tolerate the compulsory service of American citizens in the army\r\nof a South American Republic in the event of an attempt being made to\r\nimpress them during a civil war. Consequently, when hostilities began,\r\nthe Washington Legation was besieged by persons who desired to be\r\nexempted from service by getting registered as British subjects, many of\r\nwhom had announced their intention of becoming American citizens at the\r\nearliest opportunity. _Prima facie_ it seems only reasonable that\r\npersons who deliberately exchange one nationality for another, more\r\nespecially if like many of the Irish emigrants they have professed\r\nundying hostility to England, and everything English, should accept any\r\nliability imposed upon them, but the question was complicated by the\r\nfact that they had not acquired full rights of citizenship, the\r\nnaturalization of a foreigner in America, necessitating a residence of\r\nfive years in the United States, and a declaration of intention three\r\nyears in advance.\r\n\r\nInstructions upon this question were requested from Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment before the war broke out, and in reply it was stated that\r\nthere was nothing in International Law which prohibited a Government\r\nfrom requiring resident aliens to serve in the police or militia; if,\r\nhowever, the militia were to be embodied for active service, and\r\nsubstitutes were prohibited, then 'the position of British subjects\r\nwould appear to deserve very favourable consideration, and to call for\r\nevery exertion being made in their favour.' A similar opinion was\r\nexpressed in July, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty really arose out of the defective military organization\r\nof the United States, which was based upon the voluntary system. The\r\nso-called voluntary system, which is in reality only a high-sounding\r\ndevice to impose upon an impecunious minority what ought to be a general\r\nobligation, may be an admirable institution in time of peace, but it\r\ninvariably breaks down in a really serious emergency, and it was the\r\ntotally inadequate nature of that system which forced both combatants in\r\nthe American Civil War to have recourse to all sorts of discreditable\r\nexpedients.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that at the beginning of the war the American\r\nregular army consisted of only 16,000 officers and men all told.\r\nImmediately after the seizure of Fort Sumter, in April, 1861, President\r\nLincoln called out 75,000 militia, and in May he called for 42,000\r\nvolunteers for three years, half of whom were to serve in the regular\r\narmy, and half in the navy. At first these appeals were responded to\r\nwith the greatest enthusiasm, but it was not long-lived, for, as has\r\nbeen related, even as early as the battle of Bull's Run in July, militia\r\nregiments insisted upon leaving at the completion of their period of\r\nservice, and from that date the difficulty in finding recruits continued\r\nto increase.\r\n\r\nThe pay of the privates was in May, 1861, raised to thirteen dollars a\r\nmonth, which, however, may be considered low when compared with the five\r\nshillings a day we paid to untrained men during the Boer War, and it\r\nbecame clear that not only was it difficult to attract volunteers, but\r\nalso to keep them when obtained. In view of the methods employed in\r\nrecruiting them it was not surprising that the results were frequently\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe usual method employed was to inform the Governor of a State of the\r\nnumber of men required. The Governor having made the necessary\r\nannouncement, private persons came forward offering to raise regiments.\r\nEach set forth his claims, his influence in the State or among a certain\r\nportion of the population, and his devotion to the party in power.\r\n\r\nFrom the persons thus presenting themselves the Governor made his\r\nchoice. Generally the person upon whom the choice fell laid it down as\r\na condition that he should have the command of the regiment. The next\r\nthing was to find soldiers. Friends seized with the same martial ardour\r\npromised to bring so many recruits if they were made--the one a\r\nCaptain--another a Lieutenant--another a Sergeant, and so forth. The\r\nframework was thus formed and partially filled up, and the regiment\r\nbeing thus organized, the lists were carried to the Governor for his\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nThe inconveniences of such a system were obvious, and experience showed\r\nthat it was much less adapted, than had been supposed, for the purpose\r\nof raising an efficient army. It was considered, however, to possess\r\ncertain political advantages, one of which was that there was little\r\nfear of the officers ultimately forming anything like a separate\r\nmilitary or aristocratic caste.\r\n\r\nThe real inconvenience of the system, however, was that sufficient men\r\nwere not forthcoming in spite of the inducements offered by means of\r\nhigh pay, and the Government was forced to have recourse to all sorts of\r\niniquitous devices in order to get hold of so-called volunteers, many of\r\nwhom were foreigners. The most objectionable practice was that of giving\r\nbounties to agents for bringing in recruits. The effect of this at the\r\nbeginning of the war was that great numbers of men deserted from the\r\nBritish navy, and the Admiral at Halifax reported that at one time there\r\nwere a hundred deserters from one ship alone, the _St. Vincent_, but as\r\nthe contest progressed the bounty system was responsible for innumerable\r\ncases of kidnapping in which British subjects were the sufferers.\r\nKidnapping especially flourished in New York where the emigrants were an\r\neasy prey, and to such a point had corruption been carried that the\r\nGovernor admitted to the British Consul that out of every million of\r\ndollars expended in bounties, fully four-fifths of the amount were\r\nsecured by bounty and substitute brokers and crimps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    'The fraud and violence combined,' wrote Consul Archibald from New\r\n    York, 'which are now used in procuring recruits for both army and\r\n    navy are disgraceful, and it is idle for the authorities to think of\r\n    putting down the malpractices of the villains who carry on the\r\n    business of kidnapping recruits, or of making the world believe they\r\n    are sincere, while they hold out such inducements to these vagabonds\r\n    for carrying on their White Slave Trade and Black Slave Trade too. I\r\n    have numerous complaints, but, as in a great majority of cases the\r\n    victims, at last, succumb and take a portion of the bounty, for they\r\n    rarely get more than a portion, it would be unavailing to ask for\r\n    their release.'\r\n\r\n    In the autumn of 1862, Fire Island was filled with unfortunates\r\n    cheated and deluded, or forced thither by the police who received\r\n    ten dollars a head for each man. Now in addition to the enormous\r\n    bounties offered, there is placarded in conspicuous places on the\r\n    walls of the New Park barracks at the City Hall the following very\r\n    suggestive notice: 'Fifteen dollars Hand Money given to any man\r\n    bringing a volunteer.'\r\n\r\nThe following report from a Federal General shows that the strictures of\r\nConsul Archibald were thoroughly justified.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Important Letter from General Wistar._\r\n\r\n    VICTIMS OF THE BOUNTY SWINDLERS DESERTING IN LARGE NUMBERS,--EVILS\r\n    OF THE PLUNDERING SYSTEM ON OUR ARMIES IN THE FIELD, ETC.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Headquarters United States Forces,\r\n    Yorktown, Va., April 15, 1854.\r\n\r\n    General--An extended spirit of desertion prevailing among the\r\n    recruits recently received from the North, in some of the regiments\r\n    of my command, has led me to make some inquiries resulting in\r\n    apparently well-authenticated information, which I beg respectfully\r\n    to communicate to you in this unofficial manner, deeming it required\r\n    by humanity, no less than by our common desire to benefit the\r\n    service.\r\n\r\n    There seems to be little doubt that many, in fact I think I am\r\n    justified in saying the most, of these unfortunate men were either\r\n    deceived or kidnapped, or both, in the most scandalous and inhuman\r\n    manner, in New York city, where they were drugged and carried off to\r\n    New Hampshire and Connecticut, mustered in and uniformed before\r\n    their consciousness was fully restored.\r\n\r\n    Even their bounty was obtained by the parties who were instrumental\r\n    in these nefarious transactions, and the poor wretches find\r\n    themselves on returning to their senses, mustered soldiers, without\r\n    any pecuniary benefit. Nearly all are foreigners, mostly sailors,\r\n    both ignorant of and indifferent to the objects of the war in which\r\n    they thus suddenly find themselves involved.\r\n\r\n    Two men were shot here this morning for desertion, and over thirty\r\n    more are now awaiting trial or execution.\r\n\r\n    These examples are essential, as we all understand; but it occurred\r\n    to me, General, that you would pardon me for thus calling your\r\n    attention to the greater crime committed in New York, in kidnapping\r\n    these men into positions where, to their ignorance, desertion must\r\n    seem like a vindication of their own rights and liberty.\r\n\r\n    Believe me to be, General, with the highest esteem, your obedient\r\n    servant,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    J. J. WISTAR.\r\n\r\n    To Major-General John A. Dix, New York City.\r\n\r\nThese outrages committed in the name of the Voluntary System, and many\r\nof the victims of which were Englishmen, constantly took place even\r\nafter the Act of July, 1862, which provided for the enrolment in the\r\nmilitia of all able-bodied citizens between the ages of eighteen and\r\nforty-five, and it may be presumed therefore either that the United\r\nStates Government was afraid to enforce its laws or that the so-called\r\n'volunteers' were chiefly foreign subjects. In any case, amongst\r\nthese unhappy victims were numerous British youths under twenty-one\r\nyears of age, and the efforts made to obtain their discharge on the\r\nground of their being minors were rarely successful and eventually\r\nabandoned altogether.\r\n\r\nIn the South, apparently, the state of things was equally bad, if not\r\nworse; British subjects were imprisoned on all sorts of pretexts in\r\nspite of Consular protection papers, and enlistment was frequently the\r\nprice of liberty. The Southern press was particularly scathing on the\r\nsubject of aliens, especially Irishmen who endeavoured to evade military\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    We can conceive nothing more disgraceful than the conduct of\r\n    Irishmen, for example--but we trust they are few--who have been\r\n    cursing the British Government ever since they could talk, who have\r\n    emigrated to this country to escape the British Yoke, but who now\r\n    run to an English Consul and profess themselves subjects of Queen\r\n    Victoria in order to evade their duties in the land of their\r\n    adoption. We say that we fervently trust there are but few Irishmen\r\n    of whom this can be said, for such are a disgrace to their old\r\n    island, and bring the blush of shame to the cheek of their\r\n    compatriots who fight in our foremost ranks upon every field. Nobody\r\n    will be more pleased than our good Irish citizens if these fellows\r\n    are sent under guard to the camp.\r\n\r\n    The attention of conscript officers is therefore called to the\r\n    foreign Consul's offices, to the railroad cars and the roads.\r\n\r\nThe question of the liability to conscription of British subjects\r\nnaturally produced a voluminous correspondence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n     Washington, July 24, 1863.\r\n\r\n    Military events, or at all events military news, have been scarce\r\n    during the last few days. The really important question seems to be\r\n    the enforcement of the Conscription Act. On the one hand we hear of\r\n    wide-spread plans of resistance to it, organized among the Germans,\r\n    as well as the Irish population in all parts of the Country; on the\r\n    other hand it is represented that the Government is determined to\r\n    enforce it at the point of the bayonet, and to begin at New York, as\r\n    soon as it can get things ready. We have as yet had no proof that\r\n    any serious resistance to the Government will be provoked by any\r\n    measures it may take. The Democrats at New York are, as might be\r\n    expected, frightened by the mob--they dare not encourage resistance\r\n    to the Conscription, lest they should let loose an uncontrollable\r\n    gang of plunderers. On the other hand, if the Government succeeds in\r\n    getting military command of New York there is very little chance of\r\n    any but the Government candidate's coming in as President when Mr.\r\n    Lincoln's term expires.\r\n\r\n    British subjects are not the least violent in language about the\r\n    Draft, and are far from being pleased either with H.M. Government or\r\n    with H.M. Minister here. I have given myself a world of trouble to\r\n    make the burthen of proving their claim to exemption as light as\r\n    possible. If I have not succeeded as well as I ought, I have done\r\n    more than most people, who knew anything about the difficulties,\r\n    expected. I have written you a very long despatch about it--much\r\n    longer than I intended, but I thought it well to put something on\r\n    record to show that the matter had been properly attended to. I have\r\n    taken more pains myself about it, and given Mr. Seward more trouble\r\n    about it, than about any matter which I have had to treat with him.\r\n\r\n    M. Mercier's absence has made it difficult to concert measures\r\n    speedily about the Cotton question, but his Secretary of Legation\r\n    and I intend to speak to Mr. Seward about it to-morrow. We do not\r\n    mean to go to Mr. Seward together. I have so little hope of\r\n    effecting anything practical, that I should hardly feel in earnest\r\n    about it, if it were a matter of less importance. As it is, I shall\r\n    of course do my best. As soon as this affair is in train, I hope to\r\n    set out for Canada. My present notion is to wait here for the\r\n    despatches from London of the 18th--which ought to arrive the middle\r\n    of next week--and to wait at New York for the despatches from London\r\n    of the 25th, and then, if they bring nothing to hinder it, to go on\r\n    to Quebec. I shall present Mr. Stuart as _Chargé d'affaires_ before\r\n    I leave Washington. It would be impossible to carry on the immense\r\n    amount of protection to British subjects' business here, without\r\n    some one on the spot who could write officially to the Government.\r\n    Mr. Stuart is both perfectly capable of managing difficult questions\r\n    himself, and perfectly willing to refer them to men higher in office\r\n    when it is proper to do so--a rare combination of merits.\r\n\r\nThe question was finally decided to the satisfaction of His Majesty's\r\nGovernment by a Proclamation of the President which allowed aliens a\r\nperiod of sixty-five days, during which their departure was permitted,\r\nand interference on behalf of persons who had failed to take advantage\r\nof the opportunity was subsequently refused. As for the difficulties\r\nexperienced by the United States Government, they seem to have been met\r\nby enforcing conscription where it was possible, and delaying it where\r\nserious opposition was feared.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1863, a somewhat surprising proposal came from Mr. Seward. In\r\na confidential conversation with Lord Lyons he expatiated upon the\r\nnecessity of reviving a better feeling between Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States, and of making some demonstration calculated to produce\r\nthe desired effect. England, he said, had made such a demonstration\r\nbefore the war by the visit of the Prince of Wales, which had been\r\nproductive of the happiest results. Now it was the turn of the United\r\nStates to make a corresponding display of goodwill, but it was difficult\r\nto devise the means of doing so, as the President could not travel, and\r\nAmerica possessed no Princes. Would Lord Lyons think the matter over?\r\n\r\nThe latter, having duly reflected, expressed the opinion that there was\r\nno real hostility to the United States in England, although there was\r\nundoubtedly a certain amount of sympathy with the South, and that\r\nconsequently there was no necessity to take any extraordinary step. Mr.\r\nSeward, however, having returned to his suggestion of making some\r\ncounter demonstration in the nature of the visit of the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    'The only conjecture I can make,' wrote Lord Lyons, 'is that he\r\n    thinks of going to England himself. He may possibly want to be\r\n    absent for some reasons connected with the Presidential contest. If\r\n    he thinks that he has himself any chance of being taken as a\r\n    candidate by either party he is the only man who thinks so at this\r\n    moment. It is however generally considered to be an advantage to a\r\n    candidate to be out of the country during the canvass. I cannot see\r\n    any good which his going to England could effect with regard to\r\n    public opinion. If he considered himself as returning the Prince of\r\n    Wales's visit, the absurdity of the notion would alone prevent its\r\n    being offensive. The majority of the Americans would probably be by\r\n    no means pleased if he met with a brilliant reception. He has,\r\n    besides, so much more vanity, personal and national, than tact, that\r\n    he seldom makes a favourable impression at first. When one comes\r\n    really to know him, one is surprised to find much to esteem and even\r\n    to like in him. It is however hardly worth while to say more on the\r\n    subject, for it is a mere conjecture of mine that he was thinking\r\n    of going to England when he spoke to me. It might however be of\r\n    advantage for me to know whether you would wish to encourage the\r\n    idea of some public demonstration or other, if he should return to\r\n    the subject when I get back to Washington. I told him that so far as\r\n    public opinion in England was concerned, the one thing to do was\r\n    to let us really have a supply of cotton; that without this\r\n    demonstrations and professions would be unsuccessful: that with it\r\n    they would not be required.'\r\n\r\nWhether Lord Lyons's conjecture was well founded or not, the prospect of\r\na visit from Mr. Seward possessed no charms for Lord Russell, whose\r\nantipathy to the American Secretary of State has been already noted. The\r\nfollowing letter appears to be full of good sense and instructive as\r\nregards the real value of those visits of exalted personages which\r\nproduce such illimitable enthusiasm in the press.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Oct. 2, 1863.\r\n\r\n    Upon considering Mr. Seward's hints to you of doing something here\r\n    as an equivalent or a return for the Prince of Wales's visit to the\r\n    United States, I do not see my way to anything satisfactory. These\r\n    visits of Great Personages seldom have more than a transient effect;\r\n    they form no real and solid relation of friendship between nations,\r\n    though if undertaken at a fortunate moment, they serve to bring out\r\n    and demonstrate a friendship already existing.\r\n\r\n    The visit of the Prince of Wales was thus fortunately well timed;\r\n    but if Mr. Seward or any conspicuous statesman of the United States\r\n    were to visit this country now he would find us all divided. The\r\n    Government would show him every attention and civility: the\r\n    Anti-Slavery party would probably make great show of sympathy by\r\n    addresses and public receptions. But the party who press for\r\n    recognition of the South would hold aloof, and in some unmistakable\r\n    manner, prove that there is a great deal of sympathy with the South\r\n    in this country.\r\n\r\n    In these circumstances I do not think that any such mark of\r\n    friendship as Mr. Seward suggests would be likely to produce the\r\n    good effect of which he is desirous. Mr. Sumner's conduct is very\r\n    bad; he has taken infinite pains to misrepresent me in every\r\n    particular. I have done my best to counteract his efforts by my\r\n    speech at Blairgowrie. I don't know how far I may be successful, but\r\n    I rely on your constant watchfulness to prevent any rupture between\r\n    the two countries, which of all things I should most lament.\r\n\r\n    The question of the ironclads is still under investigation. The\r\n    Cabinet must consider it very soon, and I have no doubt we shall do\r\n    all that is right to preserve our neutrality free from just\r\n    reproach--unjust reproach we shall not yield to.\r\n\r\n    I hope you are now quite well, and as the heats must be over I trust\r\n    you will not suffer for the next six months from the climate of\r\n    Washington.\r\n\r\nOwing to continual ill-health, Lord Lyons was compelled to pay a visit\r\nto Canada in the autumn, and upon his return to Washington in October,\r\naccompanied by Admiral Milne, he found Mr. Seward in a more conciliatory\r\nframe of mind than ever, chiefly owing to the detention of Confederate\r\nironclads in England. Mr. Welles and the lawyers at the Navy Department,\r\nhowever, still 'appeared to be thoroughly wrongheaded and unable to see\r\nthat municipal law is one thing and International Law and the relations\r\nbetween Governments another.' The Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Chase,\r\nengaged on an electioneering tour, distinguished himself by spirited\r\nspeeches, talking of 'taking Old Mother England by the hair and giving\r\nher a good shaking,' and was himself outdone in rancour against England\r\nby another distinguished politician, Mr. Sumner. There was in fact no\r\nsign of change in the feeling of the people at large towards us, and the\r\nvisit of a Russian squadron to New York was made the occasion of an\r\nanti-British and anti-French demonstration.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the war had now lasted for several years, it seems\r\nrather remarkable that the British Government had not thought it worth\r\nwhile to send military or naval officers to watch the operations, but\r\njudging from the following letter, the idea never seems to have occurred\r\nthat there was anything to learn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Nov. 3, 1863.\r\n\r\n    I have no news of importance--political or military to write to-day.\r\n    The crisis at Chattanooga has not yet taken place, so far as we\r\n    know.\r\n\r\n    I doubt whether people in Europe are aware of the extent of the\r\n    progress of this Country in military strength or of the preparations\r\n    which have been made for the contingency of a War with an European\r\n    Power. It is impossible for me to undertake to give anything like\r\n    detailed information on the subject; but it may be worth while for\r\n    Her Majesty's Government to consider whether it is important for\r\n    them to know what is really being done, and if so, what measures\r\n    will be best with a view to their obtaining regularly information\r\n    practically useful. I have no fancy for having a military or Naval\r\n    Attaché--and I am not certain how the appointment of one might be\r\n    taken here. It _might_ create suspicion--on the other hand it\r\n    _might_ be taken as a compliment. I am inclined to think that\r\n    Officers unconnected with the Legation sent quietly, but by no means\r\n    secretly, would learn most. But if the Legation is to be depended\r\n    upon for the information, it is absolutely necessary that there\r\n    should be in it some one having a professional knowledge both of\r\n    naval and military matters. I myself know as little of such matters\r\n    as any man--and were it otherwise, I have as much proper Diplomatic\r\n    business to do as I can manage. The correspondence with Mr. Seward,\r\n    which requires minute care in many cases, grows more and more\r\n    burdensome. New cases arise daily, and the old ones never seem to\r\n    come to an end. I have had considerably more than nine hundred notes\r\n    from Mr. Seward already this year.\r\n\r\n    I don't think the Government here at all desires to pick a quarrel\r\n    with us or with any European power, but the better prepared it is,\r\n    the less manageable it will be.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was eventually acted upon as appears later.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the mission to Europe of Messrs. Mason and Slidell\r\nhaving failed in its object, the Confederate Government resolved upon\r\nthe expulsion of the British Consuls resident in the South, who were\r\ninformed that they could no longer be permitted to exercise their\r\nfunctions, or even to reside within the limits of the Confederacy.\r\nDoubtless the active part the Consuls had taken in endeavouring to\r\nprevent the compulsory enlistment of British subjects contributed\r\ntowards this action, but the ostensible reasons were, firstly, that they\r\nreceived their instructions from the British Minister residing in\r\nWashington, and secondly, that Mr. McGee, the Consul at Mobile, had been\r\ndismissed from his post because he had allowed specie intended for the\r\npayment of interest on a State debt to be shipped from that blockaded\r\nport to London on board of a British warship. In Lord Lyons's opinion\r\nthe action of Mr. Jefferson Davis's Government appeared reasonable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Nov. 17, 1863.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Walker has sent me a copy of his despatch to you enclosing Mr.\r\n    Benjamin's letter to Mr. Slidell explaining the reasons to be given\r\n    for the expulsion. The objection to the Consuls being under the\r\n    orders of the Minister at Washington appears reasonable enough. As\r\n    you know, I have all along been of opinion that the connexion\r\n    between the Southern Consulates and the Legation was full of\r\n    inconvenience. The objection to Mr. Cridland's appointment, that it\r\n    was made by me, has, in fact, no other foundation than that your\r\n    orders to Mr. Moore on the subject were sent through me; in\r\n    transmitting them I took the precaution expressly to desire Mr.\r\n    Moore to word the appointment as one coming from H.M. Government\r\n    and not to mention me.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Benjamin's lecture on the duty of Belligerents to pay their\r\n    debts is totally beside the purpose. Of course no one could have\r\n    wished more than I did that the British creditors should receive\r\n    their money. I wished that all British subjects should be able to\r\n    remove their property from the Confederate States, and most of all I\r\n    wished that an unlimited amount of cotton should be exported. What I\r\n    objected to was that a British Consul should engage himself in\r\n    committing a breach of blockade, and that a British man of war,\r\n    which had been admitted on the faith that she should carry away\r\n    nothing but despatches, should carry through the Blockade the very\r\n    article to the exportation of which the United States most objected.\r\n    It is rather cool of Mr. Benjamin to say that the United States\r\n    could not but have been glad that specie should be exported, when he\r\n    knew that at the time the great anxiety of the Confederates was to\r\n    get specie through the blockade to pay for their purchasers of\r\n    warlike stores in Europe, and that the great anxiety of the United\r\n    States was to prevent this.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1863 it became evident that the cause of the South was\r\nfailing, but the reverses of the Confederates seemed only to stimulate\r\nthem to fresh exertions, while President Davis's eloquent message in\r\nDecember proclaimed that the patriotism of the people was equal to every\r\nsacrifice demanded by their country's needs.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding autumn, Mr. Seward, in pursuance of his laudable policy\r\nof conciliation, had suggested that the Reciprocity Treaty with Canada,\r\nwhich would expire shortly, might afford an opportunity of making a\r\nfriendly demonstration. His suggestion was that the British Government\r\nshould make inquiries from him on the subject of its renewal, but Lord\r\nRussell, who was prone to regard him with suspicion, had not responded\r\nto this advance with any favour. In the early part of 1864 it became\r\nevident that the treaty was in considerable danger, and the Canadian\r\nGovernment began to show signs of natural anxiety, especially in view of\r\nthe fact that a hostile motion was pending in Congress. The following\r\nletters disclose the objections of the professional diplomatist to being\r\nsaddled with amateur assistants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Viscount Monck._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Jan. 28, 1864.\r\n\r\n    The Canadians appear to me to be acting unwisely about the\r\n    Reciprocity Treaty at this moment. Their true policy is to keep as\r\n    quiet about it as possible. The more they agitate, the more they\r\n    convince people here that the Treaty is a good bargain for Canada\r\n    and a bad bargain for the United States. The utmost we can ever\r\n    dream of doing now is to stave off a successful motion in Congress\r\n    calling upon the President to give the notice for abrogating the\r\n    Treaty. I doubt whether we shall be able to do this, but our only\r\n    chance lies in keeping quiet and endeavouring to induce the Executive\r\n    Government to exert its influence unostentatiously against the\r\n    motion. If the Executive Government can be induced to do so, it will\r\n    be by considerations connected with its relations with the Imperial\r\n    Government. The moment the question is treated as one between the\r\n    United States and the Provinces, all hope of maintaining the Treaty\r\n    vanishes.\r\n\r\n    I cannot have a Canadian here supposed to be peculiarly in\r\n    my confidence on the subject. This would impose upon me a\r\n    responsibility which I cannot undertake. Directly there was the\r\n    least appearance of a Canadian being here in any such position, I\r\n    should feel bound to take decisive steps to show that the appearance\r\n    was false. My own opinion is that the Canadians will only do\r\n    themselves harm by coming lobbying here; but if they choose to do\r\n    so, they must do it entirely independently of me, and I would\r\n    suggest that any who came for this purpose should not be furnished\r\n    with letters of introduction to me, and should be advised not to\r\n    call upon me.\r\n\r\n    At the same time, I think it right to say that I do not believe that\r\n    we shall find it possible to maintain the Treaty long after the U.S.\r\n    can abrogate it. The impression is very strong that it is a bad\r\n    bargain for them, and they will probably give the notice very soon\r\n    after the terms of the Treaty allow of their doing so, with a view\r\n    perhaps to negotiating another. If matters reach this point, it will\r\n    no doubt be very desirable that whoever negotiates the new Treaty\r\n    should be thoroughly informed on all the details of Canadian\r\n    commerce, and then will be the time for a Canadian Cobden to be sent\r\n    here. At present there are no questions of detail to be considered:\r\n    the only practical thing is to stave off the notice of the\r\n    abrogation as long as possible, and the only chance of doing this,\r\n    is, in my opinion, the exertion of the _Imperial_ influence.\r\n\r\n    I very well understand the difficulty of keeping quiet when one is\r\n    very anxious on a subject, and the immense relief it is to be doing\r\n    something. I can also well understand that if there were a\r\n    discussion on the details of the Treaty, the Canadians would wish to\r\n    have an advocate better informed on the details than the British\r\n    Minister at Washington is ever likely to be, but the object now is\r\n    to _avoid_ discussion.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary, however, to modify these views, for Mr. Seward\r\nchanged his mind, and whereas he had at first discountenanced the\r\npresence of official and semi-official Canadian representatives he now\r\nexpressed himself in favour of their coming over privately and lobbying\r\nMembers of Congress, that being, in his opinion, an effective method of\r\npromoting good relations between the two countries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Feb. 9, 1864.\r\n\r\n    I am very sorry to say that the agitation against the Reciprocity\r\n    Treaty has gone on increasing, and that it now appears probable that\r\n    a Resolution calling upon the President to give as soon as possible\r\n    notice for abrogating it, will be passed by Congress. The Canadian\r\n    Ministers are very anxious to be doing something in the matter, in\r\n    order to cover their responsibility as regards their constituents\r\n    hereafter. They had a desire to send an agent here to advise with me\r\n    and to speak to the American Cabinet and to members of Congress.\r\n    This I have told Lord Monck privately, I will not hear of. I could\r\n    not undertake to keep the peace for a month if I had a man here by\r\n    my side, over whom I could have no practical control, and who would\r\n    be really guided only by Canadian party politics, but who would yet\r\n    be supposed to be more or less in my confidence, and therefore to be\r\n    entitled to speak for me and H.M. Government. My troubles are great\r\n    enough without adding Canadian electioneering views to the\r\n    difficulties I have to contend with.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Seward's opinion was that the quieter the Canadians kept the\r\n    better, and so was mine, and so it would be still, if Mr. Seward had\r\n    not changed his. He now thinks that discussion on the subject cannot\r\n    be avoided, and a good effect would be produced by visits to\r\n    Washington of influential Canadians coming 'on their own hook' and\r\n    talking in a friendly manner to Senators and Deputies. He does not\r\n    recommend that they should appear to have any special connexion with\r\n    me, nor any semblance of an official or quasi-official character of\r\n    any kind, nor does he consider it to be desirable that any one\r\n    individual should stay long.\r\n\r\n    I am corresponding privately with Lord Monck about this action of\r\n    Mr. Seward's, and I defer writing about the Treaty officially until\r\n    I come to some understanding with him about it. Mr. Seward's opinion\r\n    is so much more likely to be correct than mine, that I do not like\r\n    to discourage Canadians coming in the way he suggests. Beside which\r\n    I have very little hope of staving off the Resolution for the\r\n    abrogation of the Treaty in any way, and therefore do not feel\r\n    justified in preventing efforts being made by the Canadians\r\n    themselves, provided I am clear of all connexion with them, and\r\n    that they do not compromise me or the Imperial Government.\r\n\r\n    The attack on the Treaty is now caused much more by ill will to\r\n    England and her Colonies than by any commercial or financial\r\n    considerations. The same spirit has caused the introduction of a\r\n    Bill into Congress to repeal the Act allowing goods to pass through\r\n    the United States without paying duty in transit to and from Canada.\r\n    In fact the absence of any serious opposition in Congress renders\r\n    both Houses very unmanageable.\r\n\r\nThe views expressed in these two letters may appear unsympathetic as\r\nregards Canada, but apart from his rooted and well-founded distrust of\r\namateur diplomatists, Lord Lyons's main task was to keep the peace if\r\npossible between England and the United States, and he was therefore\r\njustified in refusing to be associated with any persons who might\r\nconceivably add to the difficulty of a very critical situation. In\r\naddition to this he was always inclined to resent the tendency of\r\nCanadian Ministers to do a little diplomacy of their own, and held\r\nstrongly that it would be time enough for them to think of diplomacy\r\nwhen they had provided themselves with an army and a navy.\r\n\r\nThe extreme caution which he constantly displayed in avoiding anything\r\nwhich might disturb American susceptibility in the smallest degree is\r\nwell illustrated by a letter to Mr. Hammond respecting the appointment\r\nof a new secretary to the Washington Legation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Mr. Hammond._\r\n\r\n    Washington, April 5, 1864.\r\n\r\n    I have been terribly frightened by hearing that there has been a\r\n    notion of sending Mr. Horace Johnstone to this Legation. To have the\r\n    brother of a man married to the sister of Slidell's Secretary of\r\n    Legation in Paris would expose the whole of this mission to all\r\n    kinds of suspicion and ill will. It is impossible for any one not\r\n    here to conceive the captiousness of the Federals, in and out of\r\n    office, on these points. It is almost beyond my power to keep\r\n    matters straight with them, do what I can, and if I had a man in the\r\n    Legation who was personally suspicious to them I should have no hope\r\n    of keeping out of scrapes. If Mr. Johnstone were here, I think the\r\n    only way I could employ him for the advantage of H.M.'s service\r\n    would be in carrying the next despatches home.\r\n\r\nSo much alarmed was he at the prospect of Mr. Johnstone's appearance\r\nthat he also communicated his objections to the Private Secretary at the\r\nForeign Office, and even wrote to Lord Russell saying that if Mr.\r\nJohnstone arrived he should feel it his duty to order him to remain at\r\nthe port of disembarkation until further instructions were received.\r\nMost men would probably have considered that the family connexions of a\r\njunior member of the Legation were of no importance, but Lord Lyons\r\nwas one of those who never took any risks.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the suggestion made in the previous autumn, some\r\nofficers were at last despatched from England in order to follow the\r\noperations of the Federal Army.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, April 19, 1864.\r\n\r\n    The two military officers, Colonel Gallway and Captain Alderson,\r\n    sent by the War Office to report on military matters here, are about\r\n    to set out for the Army of the Potomac. Some great attempt will\r\n    probably be made by that army within a very short time. Everything\r\n    is supposed to depend on the success of the operations. The\r\n    Presidential Election and the Finances in particular hang in the\r\n    balance. Captain Goodenough, the officer sent here by the Admiralty,\r\n    confirms my impression that the Americans are very seriously\r\n    preparing for a Foreign War. I think we should never be for long\r\n    without naval and military officers here to watch and to report on\r\n    these matters. The men employed should be made to understand that\r\n    their principal duty is to keep H.M. Government so well informed of\r\n    the state of preparation and of the position of the naval and\r\n    military forces of the United States that if a war were to break out\r\n    at a moment's notice, our Admiralty and War Office would know\r\n    exactly what to do. It is quite impossible that a Diplomatic Mission\r\n    can do this without the assistance of professional men; and the more\r\n    completely the responsibility is thrown on the professional men, the\r\n    more effectually will the work be performed. With the present\r\n    feeling of the United States Government I think the officers had\r\n    better come with a decidedly official character, either as naval or\r\n    military attachés to the Legation, or under any other name: but I do\r\n    not think that the most effective mode of obtaining the requisite\r\n    information would be to let them subside into permanent attachés\r\n    residing here, and making mere routine reports by each mail.\r\n    It would, of course, be well before publishing any appointment of a\r\n    definite official character, to let me ascertain that it would be\r\n    acceptable to this Government to have officers here in that\r\n    particular character.\r\n\r\n    There can unhappily be no doubt that three-fourths of the American\r\n    people are eagerly longing for a safe opportunity of making war with\r\n    England, and to what extent this feeling may be played upon, and\r\n    with what results, during the Presidential Elections, no one can\r\n    say.\r\n\r\n    The ill will shows itself in many ways--principally in vexatious\r\n    proceedings in regard to the neighbouring Colonies. The last attempt\r\n    in Congress is to repeal an Act of 1831 in virtue of which there are\r\n    no higher duties levied on British rafts, boats, and Colonial\r\n    vessels in the American ports on the Lakes, than are levied on\r\n    similar American craft in the British ports. I have spoken to Mr.\r\n    Seward about it, and I hope, if it is a matter of importance to\r\n    Canada, that we shall be able to stop it.\r\n\r\nThe ill will alluded to above showed itself in an unpleasant and\r\nundignified manner in connection with the visit of the British officers.\r\nApplication had been made on behalf of Major-General Lindsay, M.P.,\r\ncommanding the Brigade of Guards in Canada to be allowed to visit the\r\nArmy of the Potomac, and, much to the surprise of the Legation, a pass\r\nwas refused by the Secretary of War, although the point was pressed as\r\nfar as was prudent; but worse was to follow, for the Secretary of War\r\nactually refused passes also to Colonel Gallway and Captain Alderson,\r\nthe two officers specially sent out by the British Government. 'I do not\r\ntrust myself,' wrote Lord Lyons, 'to say all I think about this\r\ndiscourtesy, but I have let the people here know that this is not the\r\nway to maintain friendly feelings, and have reminded them of the very\r\ndifferent manner in which we treated the officers sent by the United\r\nStates to the Crimea.'\r\n\r\nOf more importance than this act of discourtesy was the apparent\r\npreparation for a foreign war on the part of the United States\r\nGovernment. There could, unfortunately, be little doubt as to the\r\ncountry against which these preparations were being made, and the danger\r\nwas that, in the existing temper of the American people, advantage might\r\nbe eagerly taken of any conjunction of circumstances which would enable\r\na declaration of war against England to be made with tolerable safety.\r\nThe letters of Lord Russell do not display a realization of the enormous\r\nincrease of the military and naval power of the United States, and it\r\ndoes not appear that he appreciated the vast change which had taken\r\nplace in the relative power of England and the United States. In the\r\npast, the latter had been restrained from provoking hostilities by fear\r\nof the advantages which the greatly superior military and naval forces,\r\nthen habitually maintained by England, would confer on their enemy at\r\nthe outset. Now, however, they considered the reverse to be the case.\r\nThey believed, and probably they were right, that they could throw an\r\noverwhelming force into Canada, and that sudden attacks on some of the\r\nBritish colonies, such as Bermuda and the Bahamas, would in all\r\nprobability be successful. They believed that they could inflict\r\nenormous injury to British commerce, and it was plain that an immense\r\nbooty could be obtained by sending out their swift cruisers with as\r\nlittle notice as possible.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to discover an adequate explanation of the bitter\r\nfeeling which, at that time, actuated the majority of the American\r\npeople against England; and it was still more difficult to combat it,\r\nbecause it was largely unreasonable and quite regardless of facts\r\nand arguments. In reality it resulted from the exasperation caused by\r\nthe civil commotion which constituted the first check to a previously\r\nuninterrupted course of progress and prosperity, and the Americans,\r\nmortified and angry, found it a relief to vent their ill-humour upon\r\nEngland, against whom they had an old grudge. Under these adverse\r\ncircumstances, it is easy to realize how difficult must have been the\r\nposition of the British Minister at Washington, and it is not surprising\r\nthat his letters and despatches of the period were couched in a more\r\npessimistic tone than had been the case for some time. 'I am out of\r\nheart altogether,' he wrote to Lord Russell, in consequence of the\r\nmanner in which his representations to the American Government, with\r\nregard to the grievances of British subjects, were treated. These\r\ngrievances related chiefly, at this period, to the hardships inflicted\r\nupon the crews of blockade runners and to the iniquities of the United\r\nStates recruiting agencies, iniquities which were fully admitted in an\r\nofficial report of General Dix, the Military Commandant at New York, and\r\nin neither case was it found possible to obtain adequate redress. The\r\nfollowing note will serve as a sample of the communications which\r\npassed:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Mr. Seward._\r\n\r\n    Washington, July 3, 1864.\r\n\r\n    This day week you came to my door with the President to tell me that\r\n    I might write to England to say that Mr. James McHugh would be\r\n    released immediately. He was still in Fort Lafayette yesterday. What\r\n    to say in writing to England to-morrow I know not. Could not orders\r\n    be sent by telegraph to the military authorities at New York to\r\n    release McHugh at once and to report by telegraph that they have\r\n    actually done so?\r\n\r\n    I am very much pained by what has happened about Eneas and Rahming,\r\n    as well as about McHugh, and am utterly unable to devise any\r\n    satisfactory explanation to send home.\r\n\r\nTo add to his troubles the health of Lord Lyons again began to give way\r\nunder the strain, and as the following letter shows, his staff was\r\ninsufficient for the work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Mr. Hammond._\r\n\r\n    Washington, June 14, 1864.\r\n\r\n    We cannot get on without more hands in the Chancery here. I could\r\n    not refuse to let Heneage go, on the death of his father, but he was\r\n    ill to be spared.\r\n\r\n    One really first-rate second secretary and two ordinary working\r\n    second or third secretaries should come out at once if the work is\r\n    to be done. It has doubled since last year. We ordered an immense\r\n    register which we calculated would last through the year, having\r\n    made ample allowance as we thought for the usual progressive\r\n    increase of correspondence. We are already obliged to order another\r\n    of the same size.\r\n\r\n    For my own part I am worn out altogether.\r\n\r\nAlthough never prone to spare himself or to exaggerate, such phrases as:\r\n'I am worked to death here,' and 'I am worn out by the heat and the\r\nwork,' occur in letters to other correspondents, and in order to prevent\r\na complete breakdown he was directed by Lord Russell to proceed to\r\nCanada to confer with Lord Monck as to the defence of the Dominion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    July 23, 1864.\r\n\r\n    I think it will be useful that you should go to Canada soon. If, as\r\n    you think, the Americans may take a sudden resolution to attack us,\r\n    it will be important to consider how and when we can best defend\r\n    ourselves. I should be very glad that with this view you should\r\n    consult Lord Monck, and also that you should, if possible, see Sir\r\n    James Hope, who might come up the St. Lawrence to meet you at\r\n    Quebec. The defence of Quebec both by land and sea is one of the\r\n    most important points for the consideration of the Cabinet. It is\r\n    also of great importance to ascertain what the Canadian Government\r\n    are prepared to do for themselves.\r\n\r\n    If, as is probable, Grant will not succeed in reaching Richmond and\r\n    is obliged to retire, the American Government may not be willing to\r\n    add to the number of their enemies, especially as the Emperor of\r\n    Mexico may have the assistance of French troops, and may hold an\r\n    unfriendly position to the Northern, and a friendly attitude to the\r\n    Southern States. I shall be glad to send a civil or military agent\r\n    or commissioner to the Confederate States, and think of sending him\r\n    by Mexico and Texas. It would be by no means a recognition, but\r\n    would be useful as regards our interests in the Southern States.\r\n\r\nLord Russell never seems to have thoroughly believed in the ultimate\r\nsuccess of the North, and frequently expressed the opinion that, as the\r\nre-establishment of the Union was impossible, it would be well to come\r\nto terms with the South, but he could scarcely have been expected to\r\nforesee that the day would come when the United States Government would\r\norder the Emperor Napoleon out of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAs regards the mission to Canada, Lord Lyons pointed out that whereas it\r\nwas very desirable that he should confer with the Governor-General on\r\nmany questions, amongst others, the 'wholesale system of seducing,\r\nentrapping and kidnapping recruits for the United States Army from\r\nCanada,' yet that his own opinion on the naval and military questions\r\nconcerning the defence of that country was worth nothing at all. His\r\ngeneral impression, however, was that the Dominion was altogether\r\nindefensible, unless the Canadians were prepared to make such a stand\r\nand such sacrifices as the Southerners had done. Whether he ever made\r\nany recommendations, as the result of his visit, or whether, if they\r\nwere ever made, any attention was paid to them does not appear, but\r\nthere is reason to believe that the British Government eventually nerved\r\nitself to spend the stupendous sum of £50,000 on Canadian defence.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian visit was undertaken very reluctantly, in spite of\r\nweariness and ill health, partly on account of the press of work, and\r\npartly because it would be necessary to leave as Chargé d'Affaires a\r\nSecretary of Legation (Mr. Burnley), who had only just arrived in the\r\ncountry, and of whose abilities and judgment he was completely ignorant.\r\nConsequently he took the precaution of asking the Foreign Office to\r\nintimate clearly that, whether outside American territory or not, he\r\nshould still be considered the superior authority in the Legation, and\r\nthat if he deemed it necessary to give an instruction, it must be\r\nobeyed. This stipulation was not intended as a reflection upon Mr.\r\nBurnley, who indeed showed himself perfectly competent, but was merely\r\nan instance of that extreme caution which never left anything to chance.\r\n\r\nAt the end of August he was suffering so much from the excessive heat of\r\nWashington and from nervous prostration that he no longer felt able to\r\ndischarge his duties satisfactorily, and set out for Canada much against\r\nhis will, remaining there until October. The change of air, however,\r\neffected little improvement, and letters to friends announcing his\r\nreturn complain of ill health and low spirits. While on the journey\r\nback, he met at dinner, at New York, by a singular coincidence, General\r\nDix, on the night when the news of the St. Albans raid arrived. During\r\nthe dinner the latter received a telegram stating that a band of\r\nConfederate desperadoes had made a raid from Canada upon a place called\r\nSt. Albans, raided some banks and committed some murders. General\r\nDix said that he had sent orders to the military officers in the\r\nneighbourhood to take measures for apprehending the raiders, and that he\r\nhad directed these officers to use their best endeavours to seize them\r\non American territory, but that rather than allow them to escape, they\r\nwere to be pursued beyond the frontier, such action being, in his\r\nopinion, justifiable under International Law. Upon being asked whether\r\nhe had given this order on his own authority or under instructions\r\nfrom Washington, the General admitted that he had acted on his own\r\nresponsibility. This was clearly one of the most alarming incidents that\r\nhad yet occurred, and had General Dix's orders been carried out, there\r\nmust inevitably have been war between England and the United States.\r\nFortunately, however, the American Government disavowed General Dix's\r\nill-advised orders, and the prompt action of the Canadian authorities\r\ncontributed towards a peaceful solution. The raiders were seized and\r\nmade to give up their booty; police were stationed along the frontier,\r\nthe volunteers were called out, and effective steps taken to prevent\r\nsimilar occurrences in the future.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of this affair must have been one of Lord Lyons's last\r\ntransactions with the American Government, for upon his return to\r\nWashington his health rapidly grew worse, and as scarcely any letters\r\nfrom him are to be found between the end of October and the middle of\r\nDecember it is to be presumed that he was so incapacitated that the work\r\ndevolved upon Mr. Burnley. Early in November he was forced to apply for\r\nleave, which was granted in December.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Washington, Dec. 5, 1864.\r\n\r\n    I am truly obliged to you for so promptly sending me leave to come\r\n    home. When I wrote to you on the 1st of last month to ask for it, I\r\n    hardly expected to have such urgent need of it as I have now, but a\r\n    few days afterwards I became so ill as to be utterly unable to do\r\n    any work. I have not made any satisfactory progress towards a\r\n    recovery, and am scarcely in a state to travel. There seems however\r\n    to be no prospect of my getting any better while I stay here, and I\r\n    shall therefore, if possible, set out for New York to-morrow, in the\r\n    hope of being able to embark there for England on the 14th.\r\n\r\n    I am told that the American papers have stated that I have been\r\n    dangerously ill with typhoid fever. I have had no fever at all. My\r\n    principal malady is a nervous headache.\r\n\r\nIn letters to other correspondents he explained that being quite unable\r\nto work he considered himself simply an impediment to the transaction of\r\npublic business, and was going away simply on leave of absence. During\r\nthe last few days of his stay in America he was too unwell to write, or\r\neven, as he explained to Mr. Seward, equal to a conversation, and it was\r\ndoubtful whether he would be well enough to travel. Accompanied,\r\nhowever, by Mr. Sheffield, he embarked at New York and arrived in London\r\nduring the closing days of December.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that he had completely broken down under the continuous\r\nstrain of the last four years, and in view of the circumstances it was\r\nnot surprising. Some idea of the work at Washington may be gathered from\r\nthe following official figures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Despatches and Letters sent to and from Her Majesty's Legation at\r\n                   Washington during the year 1864._\r\n\r\n   Foreign Office            to Lord Lyons    966  From Lord Lyons    653\r\n   United States Government     \"      \"     1816       \"      \"     2782\r\n   Consuls                      \"      \"     1155       \"      \"     1390\r\n   Naval and Colonial\r\n   Departments                  \"      \"      311       \"      \"      360\r\n   Miscellaneous                \"      \"     2242       \"      \"     3141\r\n                                             ----                    ----\r\n                                             6490                    8326\r\n\r\nTo these figures must be added a number of lithographs and other answers\r\nfor which forms had been devised and which therefore were not\r\nregistered, nor does it seem probable that Lord Lyons's numerous private\r\nletters to the Secretary of State and other correspondents are included;\r\nwhilst there is no mention of telegrams.\r\n\r\nIt would really not be much of an exaggeration to assert that, unless\r\nabsent or incapacitated by illness, nearly every one of these thousands\r\nof documents was either originated by or submitted to the British\r\nMinister. The late Sir Edward Malet in his book 'Shifting Scenes,' has\r\nborne witness to the indefatigable industry of his chief. 'At Washington\r\nany quantity of letters arrived daily asking every imaginable question,\r\nand often making untenable complaints. They were all opened by Lord\r\nLyons, who made a pencil note upon them indicating the tenor of the\r\nanswer to be sent, and returned them to the Chancery. Draft answers were\r\nthen written, which were again sent up to Lord Lyons with the letters.\r\nHe would nearly always alter the wording. Then he put an \"L\" at the\r\nbottom, and returned them to be written out for signature. In this way\r\nnot a letter issued from the Legation which had not been approved by the\r\nchief. It was a most valuable safeguard, for you can never be sure what\r\na young man may say when he gets a pen into his hand. It is the moment\r\nwhen the evil spirit of the Jack-in-office, unless he be entirely exempt\r\nfrom it, which is very rare, gets the better of him, and prompts him to\r\nmake some epigrammatic or cutting reply. I learned no more valuable\r\nlesson while working under Lord Lyons than that every letter received\r\nmust be answered, and that the answer must be staid in form and well\r\nconsidered in substance, whatever might be the ignorance, the petulance,\r\nor the extravagance of the writer to whose letter you were replying.' It\r\nmay be added that he rigidly adhered to this practice throughout his\r\nofficial career, and that there must be many members of the Diplomatic\r\nService now living who would corroborate the opinion expressed by Sir\r\nEdward Malet.\r\n\r\nFrom the same source we learn the usual routine of the Chancery during\r\nthe Civil War. The secretaries and attachés had to be at their desks at\r\n9 a.m. They worked continuously without a luncheon interval until past 7\r\np.m., then adjourned to Willard's Hotel to indulge in the pernicious\r\nlocal habit of swallowing cocktails, dined at 8, and were frequently\r\nobliged to return to the Chancery afterwards and work till midnight or\r\neven later. There is no reason whatever to suppose that Sir Edward Malet\r\nindulged in any exaggeration, and it is therefore not surprising either\r\nthat the junior members of the Legation occasionally broke down or that\r\nmany of them were desirous of being appointed to some less exacting post\r\nthan Washington. In spite, however, of the disadvantageous circumstances\r\nunder which Sir Edward Malet passed his time at Washington, it is worthy\r\nof note that he considered that every one in the British Diplomatic\r\nService should rejoice if he had the chance of going there, and he bore\r\nemphatic testimony that, according to his experience, English people\r\nwere treated with extraordinary courtesy and hospitality however high\r\npolitical feeling may have run.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons, upon arriving in England, found a home provided for him at\r\nArundel by his sister, the widowed Duchess of Norfolk, to whom he was\r\ndeeply attached, and it was hoped that the rest and retired life would\r\nrestore him sufficiently to enable him to resume his post at Washington.\r\nHe made, however, little progress towards recovery, and for some time\r\nwas almost incapable of either physical or mental exertion; in fact, so\r\nunsatisfactory was his condition, and so remote appeared the probability\r\nof his being able to resume his duties, that, in the spring of 1865, it\r\nbecame necessary for him to resign his post and to retire temporarily if\r\nnot permanently from the service. A letter to Mr. Stuart, a former\r\nmember of his staff, explains the circumstances of his retirement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Mr. Stuart._\r\n\r\n    Norfolk House, March 16, 1865.\r\n\r\n    I am very much obliged by your kind letter inquiring for me. You\r\n    will have seen that I have gone out of the service altogether and\r\n    have become a gentleman at large without pay or pension. My health\r\n    did not admit of my fixing a time for going back, and the Cabinet\r\n    became nervous about leaving Washington without a Minister in these\r\n    critical times. I confess I do not feel so much relief or even\r\n    pleasure as might have been expected, and I seriously thought of\r\n    offering to go back immediately when I heard of the decision of the\r\n    Cabinet. But my own feelings as to health and still more the\r\n    opinions of the doctors deterred me. I have certainly got a great\r\n    deal better, but I seem to stick at a certain point. I can go about\r\n    without inconvenience, but still a small thing brings on a headache.\r\n    The old Legation at Washington is completely broken up. Malet goes\r\n    to Lisbon, Sheffield to Frankfort and Kennedy and Seymour to Vienna.\r\n    I to a certain extent enjoy being in England, but I am not well\r\n    enough nor quite sufficiently satisfied with the wind up of my\r\n    Washington Mission, to enjoy myself thoroughly. Lord Russell has\r\n    been extremely kind to me, and so indeed has every one here, but\r\n    neither I nor they can do much for my benefit while my health is in\r\n    its present state.\r\n\r\n    You seem to be doing well as usual in your present post, and you\r\n    are, I trust, flourishing in all respects.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Mr. Seward expressing his regret at being prevented from\r\nthanking President Lincoln in person for the unvarying kindness and\r\nconsideration shown to him during the last four eventful years the\r\nfollowing passage occurs:--\r\n\r\n    You will find Sir Frederick Bruce (his successor at Washington) as\r\n    anxious as I was to act in concert with you for the maintenance of\r\n    peace and good will, and you will, I am sure, be glad to form with\r\n    him the confidential and intimate relations which did so much, in my\r\n    case, to make my task easy and agreeable. The friendly and\r\n    unconstrained terms on which we were produced so much good, that I\r\n    am most anxious that my successor's intercourse with you should be\r\n    placed at once on the same footing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Seward to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Washington, March 20, 1865.\r\n\r\n    I accept your farewell with sincere sorrow. But I reconcile myself\r\n    to it because it is a condition of restoration of your health. All\r\n    of my family commend me to tender you assurances of sympathy.\r\n\r\n    I have never desponded of my country, of emancipation of her slaves\r\n    and of her resumption of her position as an agent of peace, progress\r\n    and civilization--interests which I never fail to believe are common\r\n    with all branches of the British family. So I have had no doubt that\r\n    when this dreadful war shall be ended, the United States and Great\r\n    Britain would be reconciled and become better friends than ever.\r\n\r\n    I have thought that you are entitled to share in these great\r\n    successes, as you have taken so great a part of the trials of the\r\n    war. But God disposes. I feel sure that if I never find time to go\r\n    abroad again, you with recovered health will come here to see the\r\n    reign of peace and order. So I shall not dwell upon our parting as a\r\n    final one.\r\n\r\nIt is satisfactory to realize that these two men, between whom so many\r\nencounters had taken place, parted on terms of friendship and mutual\r\nesteem. Each, in fact, had been able to appreciate the good qualities of\r\nthe other, and in subsequent communications with his own Government,\r\nLord Lyons frequently expressed the hope that Mr. Seward would continue\r\nto be responsible for the foreign policy of the American Government.\r\n\r\nThe official acknowledgment of Lord Lyons's services at Washington was\r\ncouched in warmer terms than is usually the case.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Russell to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, March 25, 1865.\r\n\r\n    As your successor, Sir Frederick Bruce, is to take his departure\r\n    this day from the shores of England, I take this opportunity to\r\n    testify to your Lordship the sense which Her Majesty's Government\r\n    entertain of your invaluable services as Her Majesty's\r\n    Representative at Washington.\r\n\r\n    The return which I enclose of the number of despatches and letters\r\n    received by Her Majesty's Mission to the United States during the\r\n    years 1864 gives some notion of the amount of labour which has been\r\n    undergone by Your Lordship, the Secretary of Legation and other\r\n    members of the Mission.\r\n\r\n    But the prudence, the moderation, the good temper, the\r\n    discrimination and the just regard to a friendly Government shown by\r\n    Your Lordship during the trying period which has elapsed while Your\r\n    Lordship was charged with the most honourable, but at the same time,\r\n    the most difficult duties with which any diplomatic agent can be\r\n    entrusted, these are incapable of any remuneration and cannot be\r\n    estimated by any measurement.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the previous pages have, to some extent,\r\ndemonstrated that Lord Russell's language was not that of hyperbole,\r\nand that the value of Lord Lyons's unobtrusive services was not\r\nover-estimated. It was the good fortune of this country to be\r\nrepresented during a protracted and dangerous crisis by a man who,\r\ndistinguished by exceptional prudence, tact, judgment, and sincerity,\r\nadded to these qualities a most minute knowledge of his own duties\r\naccompanied with indefatigable industry. It is not too much to say that\r\nany one wanting in these qualities would have found it impossible to\r\nprevent the calamity of war between England and the United States, and\r\nthe diplomatist who successfully avoids a catastrophe of this nature and\r\nat the same time protects the interests of his country is as deserving\r\nof gratitude as the successful commander who appears upon the scene when\r\ndiplomacy had failed.\r\n\r\nOne little detail characteristic of the man is worth noting. He used to\r\nstate, in after life, with much apparent satisfaction, that during his\r\nfive years' residence in the United States, he had never 'taken a drink,\r\nor made a speech.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\n(1865-1867)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough temporarily retired, it was scarcely probable that the\r\nGovernment would fail to utilize a man who had proved himself to be so\r\nvaluable a public servant, and as early as February Lord Russell had\r\nalready intimated that he proposed to offer to Lord Lyons the Lisbon\r\nLegation, although to transfer a minister from Washington to Lisbon\r\nseems a somewhat dubious compliment.\r\n\r\nIn June he was sufficiently recovered to receive the degree of D.C.L.,\r\nand in the following month there arrived from Lord Russell the offer of\r\nthe Embassy at Constantinople, Lord Russell being careful to state in\r\nhis letter that the Queen highly approved of the appointment and that\r\nLord Palmerston heartily concurred. The offer was of course gratefully\r\naccepted, and an urgent request that Malet and Sheffield should be\r\npermitted to accompany him was granted, although both had been already\r\nnamed to other posts. The appointment, when it became known, was\r\nreceived with general approval, and congratulations came from all\r\nquarters, but the signal compliment which had been paid him, far from\r\nturning his head, only elicited the expression that he knew rather less\r\nof the East than most people and that he entered upon his duties with\r\nmany misgivings.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Malet and Sheffield, Lord Lyons arrived at Constantinople\r\nin October, 1865, under somewhat peculiar circumstances. It is unusual\r\nfor two ambassadors to be present at the same post at the same time, but\r\nSir Henry Bulwer, in spite of many protestations that he wished to be\r\nrelieved of his duties, was still residing at the Embassy, having\r\npossibly imbibed the spirit of procrastination from the locality, and it\r\nis conceivable that the Foreign Office considered that the best means of\r\naccelerating his departure was to send out his successor with orders to\r\npresent his credentials as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe two ambassadors were lodged under the same roof. At first Lord Lyons\r\nwas the guest of Sir Henry Bulwer, then the conditions were reversed,\r\nSir Henry becoming the guest of his successor, and the comedy concluded\r\nwith the simultaneous presentation at the palace of the letters of\r\nrecall and letters of credence of the outgoing and incoming ambassadors.\r\nAfter rather more than a fortnight, Sir Henry Bulwer was induced to take\r\nhis departure to some unknown destination, but, much to the\r\nembarrassment of his successor, announced his intention of returning\r\nbefore long. Those who are acquainted with the history of British\r\ndiplomacy must remember a very similar episode which also occurred at\r\nConstantinople about twenty-six years ago, when a special envoy was\r\nresiding there in addition to the ambassador.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Russell._\r\n\r\n    Constantinople, Oct. 25, 1865.\r\n\r\n    Sir Henry Bulwer received me very kindly and cordially, and has told\r\n    me very fully what his views are, both as to Turkish politics in\r\n    general, and as to the particular questions now uppermost. He had a\r\n    private audience of the Sultan the day before yesterday, and after\r\n    it, went on board the _Caradoc_, intending to sail the same evening.\r\n    This, however, he did not do, and I went on board to see him\r\n    yesterday afternoon. He meant then to sail at daylight this morning.\r\n    I hear that he has now put off his departure till to-morrow. As to\r\n    his destination, he seems to waver between Malta, Naples and\r\n    Palermo. Lady Bulwer stays a little longer. Sir Henry talks vaguely\r\n    of coming back here as a traveller in the spring, and the Sultan has\r\n    offered to place a house at his disposal if he does so. I could not\r\n    tell him that I thought it advisable either for the public service\r\n    or for himself that he should come back so soon, especially as he\r\n    thinks the place particularly disagrees with him. He has been so\r\n    friendly and agreeable that I half blame myself for not being more\r\n    willing to see him again here.\r\n\r\n    I can write little that can be depended upon about public matters\r\n    here. Everybody represents everybody else as being engaged in a\r\n    series of intrigues so complicated as to be utterly beyond my\r\n    comprehension. Fuad and Ali appear very easy to get on with, and I\r\n    think that I shall have little difficulty in transacting all\r\n    important business directly with them, as long as they remain in\r\n    office. My idea is not to give an opportunity for starting\r\n    difficulties by announcing a great change which I should not be able\r\n    to carry out, but actually to do the business myself, as much as\r\n    possible without dragomans. My colleagues seeing this will no doubt\r\n    follow my example. The dragoman system will then languish, and the\r\n    opportunity may then be taken of giving it the _coup de grace_ if\r\n    that should seem advisable.\r\n\r\n    The impression made upon my mind by Fuad Pasha's conversation on the\r\n    finances was that he will make every effort to pay the interest on\r\n    the Foreign Loans regularly, but that the Government will frequently\r\n    be very hard up for money and will then raise it by any expedient\r\n    and on any terms for the moment. In this way a new irregular\r\n    internal or quasi-internal debt will arise, which, when it reaches a\r\n    certain point, will have to be converted, or funded, or provided for\r\n    in some way; and then the country becomes more and more involved.\r\n    Whether the undeveloped resources of the country, which must be very\r\n    great, can be brought into play soon enough to balance the growing\r\n    debt, I cannot of course pretend to say. The great measure in\r\n    contemplation is to secularize the Vacoufs. The tenures on which\r\n    this property is held and transmitted are so peculiar and\r\n    complicated that it will require some study to enable me to\r\n    understand the subject. I confess one cannot help feeling that most\r\n    of the property will be interrupted by dishonest agents on its way\r\n    to the Treasury.\r\n\r\n    My colleagues seem very well disposed to be cordial and easy to deal\r\n    with, but M. de Monstier, whom they all seem to regard as the great\r\n    difficulty, is not yet here.\r\n\r\nThe Constantinople Embassy, justly regarded as one of the big prizes in\r\nthe British Diplomatic Service, is, under ordinary circumstances, the\r\nmost onerous post of all; and, as past occupants know to their cost, the\r\ndistinguished position occupied by the British ambassador, the almost\r\nprincely state in which he lives, the magnificence of his residences,\r\nthe charm of the Bosphorus and the pleasure derived from living in what\r\nis at once one of the most beautiful and one of the most interesting\r\ncities in the universe, are somewhat dearly bought by the constant,\r\nthankless, and fruitless labour in which they are habitually engaged.\r\nTheir time is ceaselessly occupied in combating the intrigues of other\r\nPowers, in ineffectual attempts to redress the real or fictitious\r\ngrievances of British subjects, in the urging of nebulous schemes\r\nvaguely described as reforms, and in hopeless efforts to avert the\r\ninevitable doom awaiting a people, who, in spite of some admirable\r\nqualities, are constitutionally incapacitated from realizing what are\r\ntheir true interests. After the stress and turmoil of the last five\r\nyears at Washington, however, Constantinople must have appeared to the\r\nnew ambassador almost in the agreeable light of a rest cure.\r\n\r\nFor once in a way, things were fairly quiet: there were no signs of any\r\nimmediate crisis, and although the Turkish Government was involved in\r\nits habitual financial difficulties, in the autumn of 1865 the only\r\nquestions which appeared likely to give rise to trouble were those\r\nrelating to the Moldo-Wallachian Principalities, to Crete, and to a\r\nFirman for the Bey of Tunis. But whatever may be the internal condition\r\nof the Turkish Empire at any given period, or whatever may be its\r\nexternal relations, there is invariably one representative of the Great\r\nPowers at Constantinople whose _rôle_ it is to threaten, browbeat, and\r\ncoerce. At the period in question this duty was discharged with zest by\r\nthe French Ambassador, the Marquis de Moustier, whose mission it was to\r\n'_porter haut le drapeau de la France_'--in other words, to bully and\r\nbluster whenever opportunity permitted, and of whom the Turks and his\r\nforeign colleagues stood in deadly fear. The Russian Minister at that\r\ntime was the celebrated General Ignatieff, of whom Lord Lyons\r\nsubsequently expressed the opinion that 'General Ignatieff would be an\r\nadmirable diplomatist if he were only a little more veracious.' And it\r\nseems odd nowadays to read that on nearly every matter the French and\r\nthe Russians were in opposition to each other. In fact, General\r\nIgnatieff used to declare that his French colleague was so insupportably\r\narrogant that it was impossible to do business with him. Each\r\nendeavoured to enlist the new British Ambassador upon his side;\r\nnaturally, without success, as intrigue was essentially foreign to his\r\nnature, and he had no intention of allowing himself to become embroiled\r\nin their quarrels. Writing in November to Mr. Erskine, the British\r\nMinister at Athens, he was able to say that 'Here we are as quiet as\r\npossible; the disease with which the Turk is threatened appears to be\r\natrophy; want of money and want of men. There are no questions of\r\ninterest at this moment, nor even any particular matter for the\r\ndiplomatists to quarrel about.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Earl of Clarendon._[5]\r\n\r\n    Constantinople, Dec. 6, 1865.\r\n\r\n    I don't know what to say of the Turkish finances. Notwithstanding\r\n    the drought, the cholera, etc., etc., it is alarming that in a year\r\n    of profound tranquillity at home and abroad, the Government should\r\n    find itself absolutely without money. As this was the case, I\r\n    suppose a new foreign loan was better than scraping together, at\r\n    enormous sacrifices, enough money here to provide for the interest\r\n    of the old loans next month. They promise that they will pay over to\r\n    the Bank, as it comes in, the revenue from the sources which are\r\n    most certain, so as to provide in ample time for the interest on the\r\n    foreign loans. But what will they have left to live upon? I am\r\n    trying to get something like an accurate notion of what their\r\n    prospects are for next year.\r\n\r\n    The only probability of trouble for the present seems to be in the\r\n    Principalities. If Mr. Green[6] is right, the overthrow of Couza by\r\n    an internal revolution is imminent. As he is unable to suggest\r\n    any means of saving Couza or of making any improvement in the\r\n    administration of the Principalities, I don't know that he is wrong\r\n    in thinking it best to leave things for the present to the chapter\r\n    of accidents. At any rate I think I shall do well to try and keep\r\n    the question as quiet as possible here until I have instructions\r\n    from you about it.\r\n\r\n    As you will see by my despatches I do all the important business\r\n    myself with Aali Pasha. Of course, I do not take a Dragoman with me\r\n    when I go to him. I shall do away with the Dragoman system, as far\r\n    as it is possible and compatible with the public service to do so.\r\n    By degrees it may be done away with altogether--but it will be some\r\n    time before it will be possible to get ordinary matters done at the\r\n    Turkish office without having some one perpetually nagging at them\r\n    who can speak to them in their own language.\r\n\r\nA letter from the veteran Lord Stratford de Redcliffe to Lord Lyons is\r\nnot without interest as showing the views he held towards the close of\r\nhis life with regard to the Turkish Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDec. 13, 1865.\r\n\r\n    It gave me much pleasure to hear from you. I hope, and indeed I\r\n    doubt not, that as time moves on you will be more and more pleased\r\n    with the situation. You are lucky I think, to have no great\r\n    questions to begin with. Sooner or later some will arise, and\r\n    meanwhile you have time to sound the depths and shallows around you\r\n    and to lay a good foundation for future action. Be assured that my\r\n    good wishes will go with you, and if you surpass me in my own line,\r\n    so much the better. I am now too old to be jealous.\r\n\r\n    It does not surprise me that the Principalities continue to give\r\n    trouble. They stand in a false position towards Turkey. The allies\r\n    have not been happy in their manner of dealing with them. Prince\r\n    Couza's government is an anomaly. Austria would be a safer neighbour\r\n    to the Porte, even the whole length of the Danube, than either\r\n    Russia or an independent Union.\r\n\r\n    The finances of Turkey are, no doubt, a great and growing difficulty.\r\n    They _need not_ be so with Russia in abeyance, the Empire\r\n    guaranteed, an increasing trade, a Sultan who professes economy and\r\n    no interruption of peace. But they _are naturally_ so in right of\r\n    ministerial ignorance, of an inveterate habit of abuses, of too much\r\n    facility for borrowing, and of the little personal prudence at the\r\n    Porte. I tremble at hearing of another large loan from France. It\r\n    might be better if, acting in concert with our neighbour, we made\r\n    the Turkish Ministers feel more deeply the responsibility of their\r\n    extravagance and unwillingness to reform. I was glad to learn some\r\n    little time ago that our Government presses the Porte for statements\r\n    of its financial condition which may be relied on, and that the\r\n    Ottoman Bank maintains its independence, as opposed to the rash\r\n    requirements launched from Constantinople.\r\n\r\n    I sincerely hope that you will be able by and by to see your way to\r\n    some progress in other matters of essential reform.\r\n\r\nThe financial outlook became so alarming that at the beginning of 1866\r\nthe Turks contemplated engaging a British Controller; but--and this\r\nthrows an instructive light upon the intrigues which prevail at\r\nConstantinople--they were afraid to apply for one because they knew that\r\nif they did so, the French would insist upon a Frenchman being engaged\r\nas well. Aali and Fuad Pasha used to appear and make long speeches which\r\n'would have done credit to a Chancellor of the Exchequer,' but their\r\neloquence produced no practical result, and Sultan Abdul Aziz, who,\r\naccording to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, was pledged to economy,\r\npossessed singularly extravagant tastes, foremost amongst his\r\nextravagances being a mania for buying ironclads and endeavouring to\r\ncreate an imposing Turkish fleet. As there was no necessity to build up\r\na big navy and little probability of the Turks ever being able to make\r\nany effective use of it if ever created, the only thing to be said in\r\nfavour of Abdul Aziz's hobby was that the ironclads were always ordered\r\nin England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Constantinople, February 14, 1866.\r\n\r\n    There is rather a delicate matter for us which bears materially upon\r\n    the Ottoman finances. The Sultan has a passion for ironclad frigates\r\n    and insists upon ordering them. His Ministers (except, I believe,\r\n    the Capitan Pasha) make some feeble opposition. We have, I believe,\r\n    rather encouraged the thing than otherwise. The orders are executed\r\n    in England to the advantage of our shipbuilders, and I think Sir\r\n    Henry Bulwer had an idea that though they would not be much use in\r\n    the hands of the Turks, they might be manned and used to advantage\r\n    by allies of the Turks in case of war.\r\n\r\n    I think it would be undesirable, on many accounts, that we should\r\n    now take the initiative in remonstrating against this particular\r\n    expense. If however the question of Turkish finance comes up in\r\n    Europe we shall hear a great deal of these ironclads and we may be\r\n    asked to join France in a representation against them. We may\r\n    possibly have to propose to France to join us. If we do anything it\r\n    would be well to consult Musurus confidentially, as he has a great\r\n    deal to do with ordering them in England.\r\n\r\n    There are, I think, three mailed frigates here, one nearly ready in\r\n    England and one laid down there. It is also said that the Sultan\r\n    insists upon one still larger and more powerful being ordered, but I\r\n    do not know whether the order is actually given. The expense is of\r\n    course immense in proportion to the revenue of the country and\r\n    considering the rate at which the Porte borrows money.\r\n\r\nWhat the result of consulting Musurus Pasha was, does not appear; but,\r\nin view of the determined obstinacy of Sultan Abdul Aziz, it is not\r\nlikely that remonstrances from any quarter would have had much effect.\r\n\r\nIn February, the difficulties with regard to the Principalities came to\r\na head. Prince Couza, who had been elected Hospodar in 1859 (and who\r\nincidentally had given a great deal of trouble) was deposed by\r\nsuccessful conspirators and expelled from the country, Mr. Green, the\r\nBritish Minister at Bucharest, having thus proved himself a true\r\nprophet. The inhabitants of the Principalities appeared to be unanimous\r\nin desiring the continuation of the Union, and, at the same time, a\r\nforeign prince as their ruler, to the consternation of the Porte, which\r\nhad a well-grounded foreboding that a similar phenomenon would shortly\r\nmanifest itself in other outlying provinces of the Empire, and that\r\ndisintegration would follow. As for the other Powers concerned, the\r\nRussians were strongly in favour of a separation of Moldavia and\r\nWallachia. The Austrians were credited with the same views, while it was\r\nfeared by the Turks that the French would put forward a candidate of\r\ntheir own in the shape of a foreign prince. Eventually it was agreed to\r\nrefer the whole question to a conference at Paris, into which the\r\nBritish Government entered unshackled by any pledges or previous\r\nannouncement of its views.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Earl of Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Constantinople, March 14, 1866.\r\n\r\n    The Grand Vizier and Aali Pasha seem to be in very low spirits about\r\n    the Paris Conference. M. de Moustier seems to be constantly\r\n    frightening them. I am willing to comfort them, but I am determined\r\n    not to say anything which may be interpreted by them as a pledge,\r\n    either from my Government or myself. They are horribly afraid of\r\n    France and they would like to lean upon us, but they think that we\r\n    care more for France than for them, and believe that we are apt to\r\n    blame them for weakness without being willing to protect them\r\n    against the consequences of their resistance. I think they are wrong\r\n    in thinking that it would have been better for them to have had the\r\n    Conference here. The French Government itself seems to me to be\r\n    always more reasonable than its agents abroad.\r\n\r\n    I have not been able to get any fresh information about the\r\n    Finances. The Syndicate to receive the revenues set apart for the\r\n    payment of the Foreign Loans is not yet established, though it is a\r\n    month since Fuad Pasha assured me that the decree was 'all but\r\n    printed.' The Commission which is examining the actual state of the\r\n    Finances seems to have great difficulty in getting at the truth.\r\n    None of its proceedings have yet been made public. I preach economy\r\n    and retrenchment, but I have not mentioned the ironclads\r\n    particularly to the Ottoman authorities as General Ignatieff appears\r\n    to suppose. I have certainly not attempted to defend the expenditure\r\n    incurred for these vessels when I have heard it attacked by my\r\n    colleagues and other people.\r\n\r\n    I have certainly got on very well with my colleagues hitherto, but\r\n    then we have had no serious questions to discuss.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Turks, bullied by Moustier, at their wit's ends to find\r\nmoney, and distracted at the threat of internal troubles, seem about\r\nthis period to have once more recurred to the old proposal of a Russian\r\nProtectorate, and to have hit upon the brilliant idea of making money,\r\nat the same time, out of the Principalities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Earl Cowley._\r\n\r\n    April 18, 1866.\r\n\r\n    The Turks are very low, and I hear that a good deal of discussion\r\n    goes on about the hopelessness of obtaining any efficient protection\r\n    from the Western Powers, and the consequent necessity of making the\r\n    best terms they can with Russia. France they look upon as an enemy;\r\n    England as a lukewarm and indifferent friend. They hope that they\r\n    might get a good sum out of Russia for the Principalities; that they\r\n    might satisfy her appetite for territory by giving them to her, and\r\n    that then by letting her exercise great influence for the protection\r\n    of the Eastern Church in the rest of the Empire, they might satisfy\r\n    her, and persuade her to abstain from coming to Constantinople\r\n    herself, and to keep other Powers off. Of course nothing so absurd\r\n    as this, or at all like it, has been said to me by Aali or Fuad, but\r\n    I hear that this sort of language is held by a great many Turks\r\n    amongst themselves, and it may be a symptom worth noting.\r\n\r\n    We are all anxiety to hear something from Paris about the Plébiscite\r\n    and Prince Charles of Hohenzollern. Till I know what our Government\r\n    think, I can give no advice to the Turks.\r\n\r\nThe result of the Paris Conference was that Prince Charles of\r\nHohenzollern-Sigmaringen was chosen as Hereditary Prince of Roumania,\r\nmuch to the consternation of the Turks, who saw in this practical\r\nabandonment of their suzerainty, the approaching disintegration of their\r\nEmpire, and therefore began to threaten an occupation of the\r\nPrincipalities. This they were dissuaded from attempting, and the\r\nefforts of British diplomacy were directed towards obtaining a\r\nrecognition of Prince Charles on reasonable terms, a task which was not\r\nfacilitated by the Sultan's sudden dismissal of the capable Grand\r\nVizier, Fuad Pasha, or by the refusal of the Roumanians to behave with\r\neven decent courtesy towards the Porte. A prodigious amount of\r\nnegotiation and correspondence passed with reference to the Investiture\r\nof the Prince by the Sultan, and that the fault lay with the Roumanians\r\nis shown by the following extract from a letter[7] written in August:\r\n'The Turks have been wonderfully yielding and moderate about the\r\nPrincipalities, and if there had been anything of the same spirit at\r\nBucharest, Prince Charles would have been invested long ago. There is a\r\nhitch now, and there will be at least more delay.' In this troublesome\r\nmatter the English and the French Governments worked together in order\r\nto arrive at a satisfactory solution, and the much-denounced M. de\r\nMoustier seems to have done something to help his colleague.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._[8]\r\n\r\n    Constantinople, Sept. 12, 1866.\r\n\r\n    M. de Moustier sets out for Paris this day week. He and I have been\r\n    very good colleagues. Since Lord Clarendon decided to advise the\r\n    Porte to recognize Prince Charles, M. de Moustier and I have worked\r\n    cordially together to settle the Principalities question in that\r\n    sense, and I hope the thing may be done before he goes. A stable\r\n    honest government in the Principalities is the best thing for all\r\n    parties, and the recognition of Prince Charles is the obvious means\r\n    of arriving at this. Whether he will prove a success or a failure\r\n    will depend upon his character and his ability to govern through the\r\n    constitutional forms, for the Hospodar must in fact for some time be\r\n    a Cæsar or he will soon be nothing.\r\n\r\n    M. de Moustier is not at all liked by his other colleagues here, and\r\n    he has inspired the Turks with more fear than love. As he and I have\r\n    not differed on any serious matter (except just at first about the\r\n    Suez Canal), I cannot very well say how I should have liked him as\r\n    an opponent.\r\n\r\n    The Turks seem horribly afraid of Benedetti as his successor. I wish\r\n    the mantle had fallen upon Mercier, with whom I got on so well at\r\n    Washington.\r\n\r\nIt is strange to learn that Prince Charles, who has since developed into\r\na model constitutional monarch, produced at first the impression of\r\nbeing a perfect firebrand, full of ambitious schemes, and actually\r\ncredited with the design of eventually establishing himself as 'The\r\nCharlemagne of the East.' Mr. Green, the British Minister at Bucharest,\r\nthought it desirable to give him some paternal advice, upon his own\r\nresponsibility, telling him that the Roumanians had no intention of\r\nputting up with a mere show Prince; that he would have to work hard;\r\nthat great mistakes had been made since his arrival in the country, that\r\nthese would eventually be visited upon his head, and that he should take\r\nwarning from the fate of Couza. 'He was very polite,' added Mr. Green,\r\ninnocently, 'but I don't think he half liked what I said, or that he\r\nquite understood it. It was probably the first time he had heard the\r\ntruth since he has been in the country.'\r\n\r\nForeign princes who undertake to govern Balkan States, however, often\r\nhave to put up with worse things than unpalatable truths, and the\r\nconduct of Prince Charles and his advisers with reference to the\r\nquestion of investiture was of a nature which not only justified strong\r\nlanguage, but necessitated strong pressure from France and England.\r\nAfter bargaining and haggling for several months, and obtaining all\r\nsorts of concessions from the Porte, the Roumanians actually proposed\r\nthat 'in order to meet existing difficulties' the Prince should be\r\ninvested at Constantinople without any conditions at all. The chief\r\nstumbling block appears to have the phrase '_partie intégrante_,' in the\r\nDeclaration, and it was not until it had been made clear that neither\r\nFrance nor England would recognize the Prince unless this condition\r\nwas complied with that the sacramental words were agreed to. Eventually\r\nmore reasonable views prevailed at Bucharest, and Prince Charles at last\r\nproceeded to Constantinople for the ceremony of Investiture. The Turks,\r\nas is their wont, received him with great courtesy, and the impression\r\nhe created was of the most favourable kind, the only person who\r\nexhibited dissatisfaction being the Russian Minister.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Mr. Green._\r\n\r\n    Therapia, Nov. 1, 1866.\r\n\r\n    The Prince will, I suppose, arrive at Bucharest two or three days\r\n    before this reaches you. I hope he is satisfied with his visit to\r\n    Constantinople. There was some hitch about the interchange of\r\n    civilities with the Russian Minister and one or two other chiefs of\r\n    missions, I believe. I suppose however all was set right before His\r\n    Highness went away. The Prince himself showed, I thought, great good\r\n    sense in these matters of etiquette as well as in more important\r\n    matters. I should be glad if you would take an opportunity of\r\n    letting him understand discreetly that I personally was thoroughly\r\n    satisfied, not that he can doubt it.\r\n\r\nThe Principalities Question having been satisfactorily settled, M. de\r\nMoustier, who, in the meanwhile, had become Minister for Foreign\r\naffairs, lost no time in claiming all the credit for himself. With his\r\nusual good sense, Lord Lyons showed complete indifference to the egotism\r\nof his former colleague.\r\n\r\n    'It is the way of French diplomatists everywhere, and of almost all\r\n    diplomatists at Pera, to take to themselves the credit of every good\r\n    thing that has been done,' he wrote to Lord Cowley, 'so far as the\r\n    Turks are concerned. I have borne in mind what you told me in Paris\r\n    of your own system of dealing with them, and have endeavoured to let\r\n    them have the credit of their good deeds, whatever part I may have\r\n    had in bringing them about. M. de Moustier has certainly not\r\n    followed the same plan. His article in the _Moniteur_ gives no\r\n    credit either to the Turks or to me. Whatever may be our relative\r\n    shares in settling the questions, it cannot be doubted that if I had\r\n    chosen from jealousy, or any other motive, to thwart him, I could\r\n    easily have done so. However, if good is done, I am willing to\r\n    forego my share of the boasting.'\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to state that the semi-comic question of the\r\nPrincipalities was but one of many difficulties threatening in every\r\npart of the Turkish Empire, from the Fortress of Belgrade to the\r\nLebanon. The long letter to Lord Stanley of December 19 is one which,\r\nwith slight variations, might have been written by every British\r\nAmbassador at Constantinople at any time during the last fifty years,\r\nbut is quoted in full because it seems to constitute a comprehensive\r\nreview of the condition of Turkey at the close of 1866; and it is\r\nperhaps worthy of note, as showing how completely the politics of Europe\r\nhave changed, that the gigantic struggle between Prussia and Austria\r\npassed unnoticed and without producing the slightest apparent effect in\r\nthe Near East.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n    Constantinople, Dec. 19, 1866.\r\n\r\n    I am afraid that it is only too true that a storm is brewing in the\r\n    East. There is a very apparent change in the policy of Russia, or at\r\n    least, in that of her agents in Turkey. When I arrived a year ago\r\n    there was every appearance of a desire on the part of Russia to keep\r\n    things quiet in Turkey. Now her agents make no secret of their\r\n    sympathy with the Cretan insurrection and with Christian malcontents\r\n    throughout the Empire and appear to be determined to recover their\r\n    old position as the special friends and protectors of all the\r\n    Orthodox Christians, and to be willing enough to see troubles and\r\n    disturbances break out in all directions. Greece is bent upon\r\n    mischief, and the question whether we are or are not to have an\r\n    Eastern Question forced upon us in the spring depends upon whether\r\n    or no Greece can be kept in order. All this suits the Russian game.\r\n    If we interfere to bring the Hellenes to their senses, she hopes to\r\n    recover her lost popularity at our expense. If we do not, she will\r\n    claim the merit of having hindered us.\r\n\r\n    I cannot make up my mind to recommend the Turks to take a bold\r\n    course. Discouraging as is the spectacle afforded by the Turkish\r\n    army and navy in Crete, I think it probable that the Turks would in\r\n    the end get the better of the Hellenes if they were allowed to deal\r\n    with them without any interference from Europe. But Europe\r\n    undoubtedly would interfere. I very much dread the effects of\r\n    allowing the Greeks to get up disturbances in this country in the\r\n    spring. If the disturbances are very serious they will probably lead\r\n    to the destruction of Ottoman rule in Europe. What will take its\r\n    place it is impossible to foresee, but I think it is pretty clear\r\n    that the Turks will not go without a desperate struggle, and that in\r\n    mixed districts we shall have massacres and every kind of horror.\r\n    Great calamities may possibly be avoided if we can keep the Turks\r\n    going and make them go on tolerably well for some years longer. If\r\n    they are really capable of radical improvement, if they can live\r\n    upon equal terms with the Christians, and establish a good\r\n    government, so much the better. If things go on as they have done\r\n    lately, the Turks will be gradually squeezed out, as the Americans\r\n    say, by the increase in numbers, wealth and intelligence of the\r\n    Christians. I am not one of those who look upon the Turkish Empire\r\n    as good _per se_--to be upheld at all hazards--but in the interest\r\n    of all parties, I should like to let it down gently; but in order to\r\n    make this possible, the Turks must be prudent and behave well to all\r\n    their subjects.\r\n\r\n    The arguments against giving up the Fortress of Belgrade are\r\n    strongly put in Mr. Longworth's despatch to me of which he has sent\r\n    you a copy. For my own part I doubt whether the _Levée en masse_ of\r\n    the Mussulman population of Turkey to defend it, would not shake the\r\n    Empire to pieces. In the face of the extreme unpopularity of the\r\n    Sultan personally and of the Government with the Mussulmans, I doubt\r\n    whether the Ministers would be willing to risk an appeal to them.\r\n    The same state of things however makes the Ministers very fearful of\r\n    the effect of giving up the Fortress. It seems that Europe will\r\n    advise the Porte to abandon it, and this, I am inclined to think, is\r\n    the proper advice for Europe to give. I do not think that it is\r\n    advice which it would be fair to press very strongly unless (as is\r\n    by no means impossible) the Porte may wish to be able to say to the\r\n    Sultan and the people that they were obliged to yield to all Europe\r\n    united against them on the point. I don't think that England, or any\r\n    other power, should encourage the Porte to hold out, unless of\r\n    course it were deemed to be a matter of such importance that\r\n    material aid would be given to help the Porte out of any scrape into\r\n    which its holding out might bring it. On the other hand, unless we\r\n    were prepared to do this and to do it effectually, we should make\r\n    ourselves unnecessarily odious to the Christian races, and neither\r\n    obtain nor deserve any gratitude from the Turks, if we alone advised\r\n    them to keep the Fortress. Aali Pasha does not talk as if he had any\r\n    idea of yielding. His plan will probably be to say neither yes nor\r\n    no, unless circumstances compel him to give a categorical answer to\r\n    the Servians.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley, who at this period ruled at the Foreign Office, was not an\r\noptimist by nature, had no illusions about the future of Turkey, and his\r\nletters contain references to many other questions which appeared likely\r\nto create trouble in Europe; besides Crete and the Fortress of Belgrade.\r\nWith regard to the latter he observed that the 'Turks have the same right\r\nto stay there that every one has to do foolish things where only his own\r\ninterest is concerned.' 'The Austrians,' he wrote in October, 'have made\r\ntheir greatest mistake of this year (which is saying a good deal) in the\r\nchoice of Beust as Minister.\r\n\r\n'The general impression is that Bismark[9] (_sic_) will not be able to\r\nhold power, from the state of his health. I do not envy the King of\r\nPrussia left alone to carry out plans which he probably has never\r\nunderstood and to face a German Parliament which he only consented to\r\ncall in reliance on his adviser's capacity to manage it.'\r\n\r\nAnother letter refers to a contemplated visit of the Prince of Wales to\r\nSt. Petersburg, and, in view of 'his strong anti-Turkish opinions of\r\nwhich he makes no secret,' points out that care should be taken to\r\nexplain to the Russian Government that H.R.H. did not represent the\r\nopinions of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nOther communications from the same Minister mention that the Americans\r\nhad revived the _Alabama_ claims 'in a friendly and temperate manner,'\r\nand there are many allusions to the disquieting symptoms in France. 'I\r\nhear,' he wrote in November, 'that the one idea of everybody, high and\r\nlow, in France is that the country is defenceless (with 600,000\r\nsoldiers), and that the lowest estimate of the necessary force laid\r\nbefore the commission now sitting involves an addition of 400,000 more.\r\nThey have so long been used in that country to be surrounded by weak\r\nstates that the mere neighbourhood of an equal is regarded by them as a\r\nthreat.'\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1867 one difficulty was cleared out of the way, for\r\nLord Stanley having formally tendered his advice, the Turkish Government\r\nconsented to evacuate the Fortress of Belgrade. This unusual display of\r\ngood sense was all the more creditable on account of the terror which\r\nSultan Abdul Aziz inspired in his ministers; but the protracted\r\ninsurrection in Crete constituted not only a danger, but also a fertile\r\nsource of intrigues amongst Foreign Powers.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley took the matter-of-fact view that Greece had estranged\r\nBritish sympathy through financial immorality; and he was probably\r\ncorrect, for in the case of Turkey, it was not until the repudiation of\r\nher debts, that there was much fulmination against the iniquities of\r\nOttoman rule.\r\n\r\n'Opinion here is undecided about the Cretan quarrel,' wrote this prosaic\r\nnobleman, who is credited with having himself refused the throne of\r\nGreece. 'Nobody much believes in the Turks, but the old Phil-Hellenism\r\nis dead, and cannot be revived. Greece is too much associated in the\r\nEnglish mind with unpaid debts and commercial sharp practice to command\r\nthe sympathy that was felt thirty years ago. And now that questions of\r\nmore interest and nearer home are being discussed, Crete will drop out\r\nof men's minds.'\r\n\r\nA little later, the French Government suddenly and quite unexpectedly\r\nproposed the cession of Crete to Greece; and this violent change in the\r\npolicy hitherto pursued, rendered difficult joint action on the part of\r\nEngland and France with regard to Turkey. The original idea underlying\r\nFrench policy had been that the two Governments should force certain\r\nreforms upon the Porte, more particularly with regard to encouraging\r\npublic works to be undertaken by foreign capitalists, and that the Turks\r\nshould be made prosperous in spite of themselves. The difficulty in\r\ncarrying out this beneficent programme consisted in the fact that there\r\nwere no means of influencing the daily details of administration upon\r\nwhich its execution and success depended, and it seemed highly probable\r\nthat the joint guardianship of England and France might degenerate into\r\na struggle between the two Embassies for personal influences in making\r\nand unmaking governors and ministers, to say nothing of the danger of\r\nthe perpetration of gigantic jobs under the guise of giving public works\r\nto foreign capitalists. Nor, of course, was the Turkish Government in\r\npossession of funds to carry out any programme whatever.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley refused to entertain the French proposal with regard to\r\nCrete, and advanced much the same reasons as those probably brought\r\nforward more than forty years later.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Stanley to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, March 21, 1867.\r\n\r\n    The Eastern Question remains where it was. France has certainly not\r\n    dropped her idea of urging the cession of Crete. I have distinctly\r\n    refused to join in this advice, as you will see by my despatch. The\r\n    Russians seem jealous of French interference, though they cannot\r\n    object, as it is in the sense of their often expressed opinions. The\r\n    Italian Government shows an inclination to take part in the\r\n    discussion, but rather, as I conceive, for the purpose of asserting\r\n    its position as a first-rate power than with any definite idea of\r\n    what it wants. Indeed, I think I trace in Italy a feeling of\r\n    jealousy of the increase of the Greek power, lest Greece should\r\n    become a troublesome neighbour and rival.\r\n\r\n    The chief event which is interesting the diplomatic world at the\r\n    present moment is a report--not wholly unfounded as I believe--of\r\n    the cession of Luxemburg by Holland to France. Prussia will resent\r\n    it (if it comes to pass) and Belgium will not be the happier for\r\n    being thus partly surrounded by French territory.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor (who had probably abandoned the control of his Eastern\r\npolicy to M. de Moustier) received a warning from Lord Cowley.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Cowley to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 22, 1867.\r\n\r\n    I found Moustier on my return a very different man from what I had\r\n    left him, in respect to Turkey, but I had, a few days after my\r\n    arrival, a conversation with the Emperor in which I warned him of\r\n    the dangerous game he was playing in hastening the dissolution of\r\n    the Turkish Empire, which could only turn to the profit of Russia,\r\n    and I think that H.M. sees the matter in this light now and that he\r\n    has desired Moustier to hold his hand and not forestall events. I\r\n    fear however that things cannot go on much longer in Turkey as they\r\n    are. The great matter now should be to educate the Christians for\r\n    the emancipation which awaits them, by giving the outlying provinces\r\n    as much autonomy as possible, but it 'will be a bitter pill for the\r\n    Turks to swallow.'\r\n\r\n    There is no particular news here--fresh irritation against Prussia,\r\n    which will become dangerous if it does not die out before next year.\r\n\r\nThe vagary on the part of the French Government produced much confusion\r\namongst the diplomatists at Constantinople, who all came to the British\r\nAmbassador with such different stories of what one had done, of what\r\nanother was going to do, and of what a third would not do, that he\r\neventually became as much puzzled as any one else, and adopted an\r\nattitude of strict neutrality.\r\n\r\nThe following letter to Lord Stanley is of interest for various reasons.\r\nIt expresses the deliberate opinion of an exceptionally impartial man\r\nupon Russian policy towards Turkey, and there are references in it for\r\nthe first time to two new factors in the Eastern Question, viz. the\r\nBulgarians and the Young Turks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n    Constantinople, April 10, 1867.\r\n\r\n    The Turks stand at bay for the moment. They have sent Omar Pasha to\r\n    Crete and are confident that he will reduce the island to\r\n    submission. If he fails to do so in a reasonable time, they must\r\n    confess that the task is too hard for them and leave the settlement\r\n    of the question to the European Powers. France has played the game\r\n    of Russia and apparently has not succeeded after all in satisfying\r\n    her. She has brought Turkey nearer to ruin than it has yet been. It\r\n    all forwards the policy of Russia, which is to keep Turkey unquiet,\r\n    to prevent any approach to conciliation between Turks and\r\n    Christians, to keep up a constant drain on the finances--in short,\r\n    to have the country entirely at its mercy whenever circumstances\r\n    render it convenient to seize it. Aali Pasha and Fuad Pasha both\r\n    assure me that the dividends due in July on the foreign loans will\r\n    be punctually paid; but, with the best intentions, the Porte will\r\n    not be able to pay its foreign dividends much longer, if it is\r\n    obliged to keep a large force on a war footing on the frontier of\r\n    Greece; and to provide against insurrections excited from abroad in\r\n    other quarters. The Bulgarians appear to oppose a strong _vis\r\n    inertiæ_ to the Russian and Hellenic attempts to induce them to use\r\n    and demand autonomy. Their principal quarrel is with the Greek\r\n    clergy foisted upon them by the Patriarchate here. I have not been\r\n    able to form a positive opinion on their demands for a separate\r\n    Patriarch of their own, but I incline to think that the Porte would\r\n    do well to grant it. Russia now urges that the Bulgarians should\r\n    have a civil representative instead, but this would come very near\r\n    to autonomy.\r\n\r\n    The discontent among the Mussulmans is very great. It is\r\n    particularly so at Constantinople, where the employees of the\r\n    Government form an important class, and where in consequence of the\r\n    non-payment of salaries, they, and all who live by them, are reduced\r\n    to the greatest distress. The 'Jeune Turquie' party is produced\r\n    partly by this and partly by the desire of Mustapha Fazyl Pasha and\r\n    others to oust Fuad and Aali and to take their places.\r\n\r\n    Reports from the Consuls on the treatment of the Christians will\r\n    have been pouring in upon you. The greater part of the grievances of\r\n    the Christians are the results of bad government and bad\r\n    administration of justice, and affect Mussulmans and Christians\r\n    alike. Their peculiar grievances are their practical exclusion from\r\n    the high offices of the State, the rejection in many cases of their\r\n    evidence in the Law Courts, and what is most intolerable, the\r\n    position in which they stand socially and politically with regard to\r\n    the Turks. The Turks will not look upon them as equals and cannot\r\n    trust them. In fact the Christians cannot feel loyalty to the\r\n    Government because they are not trusted and employed; and they\r\n    cannot be trusted and employed because they are not loyal to the\r\n    Government. It is a perfect example of a vicious circle. It is\r\n    useless to deny that the position of a Christian subject of the\r\n    Porte is a humiliating position, and it is vain to expect that\r\n    within any reasonable time the Christians will look upon the\r\n    existing Government as anything but an evil to be endured or\r\n    possibly even upheld as a less evil than revolution, but nothing\r\n    more.\r\n\r\nIt will be realized from this instructive letter that however bad the\r\nTurkish Government, it had to contend with obstacles which are not\r\nencountered by other countries, and that in reality it never had a fair\r\nchance, although it is only just to add that when a real chance did\r\noccur, upon the overthrow of Abdul Hamid, in 1908, the opportunity was\r\ndeliberately thrown away.\r\n\r\nThe Turks, however, had sufficient sense to concede the Bulgarian demand\r\nfor a separate church, and by thus affecting a schism between the latter\r\nand the Greeks, succeeded in prolonging their hold over Macedonia for a\r\nlonger period than would otherwise have been the case.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lord Stanley had been thinking of other matters, and the\r\nallusions to Alaska and to Canada in the letter of April 4, afford a\r\ndelightful instance of the light in which British statesmen viewed\r\nColonial questions at that period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Stanley to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, April 4, 1867.\r\n\r\n    The Eastern Question has left us quiet during the last ten days. I\r\n    hear nothing more of the proposed cession of Crete, and I suspect\r\n    the French have found out that they had been going a little too fast\r\n    and too far.\r\n\r\n    The Luxemburg business has monopolized attention. Holland was\r\n    willing to sell the Grand Duchy if the consent of Prussia could be\r\n    secured, and France wished and wishes to buy, but Prussia steadily\r\n    refuses. Holland dares not act without Bismarck's permission, and\r\n    for the moment the plan seems to have fallen through. But the\r\n    Emperor cannot afford a fresh defeat, and I fear we have not seen\r\n    the end of the transaction. There is an almost universal expectation\r\n    of war.\r\n\r\n    The Americans, as you will see, have bought a large amount of\r\n    worthless[10] territory from Russia at a nominal price. Their motive\r\n    is probably twofold: to establish a sort of claim in the future to\r\n    British North America, lying as it does between their old and their\r\n    new possessions; and to gain a victory over us by doing without our\r\n    knowledge an act which they probably think will annoy England. In\r\n    that expectation they will be disappointed, for I cannot find any\r\n    one who cares about the matter, and the press in general treats it\r\n    with indifference. It is true that in Canada the feeling may be\r\n    different.\r\n\r\nThe Luxemburg difficulty (which had the effect of producing a temporary\r\nrapprochement between France and Russia with regard to the Eastern\r\nQuestion) was settled by a conference in London, and letters from Lord\r\nStanley and others show that war was narrowly averted, and that the\r\nFrench were not ungrateful for the action of the British Government.\r\n\r\n    'We have been too busy at home to have much leisure for Eastern\r\n    affairs,' wrote Lord Stanley. 'The success of the Conference in\r\n    keeping the peace was not, I think, expected by the general public\r\n    and has given proportionate satisfaction, more perhaps here than\r\n    elsewhere, and more in France than in Russia. The Emperor dreaded\r\n    the idea of war and would have accepted almost any terms. The\r\n    Prussians, being prepared and knowing that the French were not so,\r\n    professed great indifference as to the result of the negotiations.\r\n    Many still say that the inevitable quarrel is only postponed. It may\r\n    be so, but I am inclined to think that in such matters to gain time\r\n    is to gain everything. Irritation subsides, new questions arise to\r\n    divert attention, and the opinion of the country has time to declare\r\n    itself. I am told that at Paris the feeling of gratitude to England\r\n    is general and strong.'\r\n\r\nIn May, in spite of Crete, it was arranged that Sultan Abdul Aziz should\r\npay a visit to France, and both the French and Turks, unlike Lord\r\nRussell, whose opinion on the value of such visits has been already\r\nquoted, thought that it would be productive of great results. The Turks\r\nwere especially delighted, because they thought the invitation a proof\r\nthat France would not persist in the alliance with Russia which had been\r\nso perilous to the Ottoman Empire. It was hoped that if France could be\r\nbrought back to her old attitude of co-operation with England in\r\ndeprecating foreign aggression, things might be kept quiet, and that the\r\ninternal situation might improve. The recent pro-Russian proclivities of\r\nNapoleon III. had drawn upon him some very sharp remonstrances from Her\r\nMajesty's Government, and a despatch from Lord Cowley shows that the\r\nEmperor had to put up with some remarkably plain speaking. He was told\r\nby the British Ambassador that if he would devote a little more\r\nattention to Eastern affairs he would probably refrain from constant\r\nintervention in the internal affairs of Turkey, unless indeed he wished\r\nto see that Empire collapse; and when he attempted feebly to explain\r\nthat Russia deserved some satisfaction for her pride wounded by the\r\nresult of the Crimean War, and that the best method of restraining her\r\naggressive proceedings was to act in conjunction with her, he was\r\ninformed that the best way of meeting insidious Russian policy was by\r\nhonest and open opposition. It must doubtless have been extremely\r\nirritating to the British Government to see this disposition to fritter\r\naway the effects of the policy which led to the Crimean War, and the\r\nprobability is that the Emperor had no definite idea as to what he\r\nwanted and was merely drifting along, in his usual manner, without\r\nrealizing the possible results.\r\n\r\n    'I fancy,' said Lord Lyons, 'that great efforts will be made to\r\n    please and astonish the Sultan in France and to impress him with the\r\n    power of the country. He is not stupid or bigoted, but he has had\r\n    very little education. He is more amiable than he looks. He speaks\r\n    only Turkish. His hobby is the Navy and the way for us to impress\r\n    him would be to show him as many ships, and particularly ironclads,\r\n    as we can--that is to say if we can show as many or more than the\r\n    French. He is Oriental enough to expect hospitality, as he practises\r\n    it here, and I suppose he would be much hurt by any etiquette which\r\n    he thought a slight. Politically, I think a visit from him to\r\n    England would be a good thing if we received him personally as well\r\n    as the French did. As he has taken up the idea of going to England,\r\n    he would of course be very much mortified at not being cordially\r\n    received, and advantage would be taken of anything of the kind by\r\n    the enemies of Turkey here to weaken his and our position. I\r\n    suggested to Fuad Pasha to let the question of his visit to England\r\n    be still, until I could communicate with you about it, but I\r\n    understand he has telegraphed to Musurus to speak to you. I suppose\r\n    the Sultan, of whom they all seem as much afraid as if he still cut\r\n    off heads, ordered him to do so and he dared not object. I believe\r\n    the Sultan will not leave Constantinople till he has made quite sure\r\n    of not finding the Emperor of Russia at Paris. Fuad says he will\r\n    take a very small suite, but I suppose it will be a larger suite\r\n    than a European Sovereign would have. I believe he will take a sort\r\n    of noble guard he has, who wear very picturesque costumes of\r\n    different parts of the Empire: there used to be fifty of them, but I\r\n    hardly suppose all will go.'\r\n\r\nIt very soon became evident that the Sultan was quite determined to go\r\nto England, and it was clearly desirable that he should be received with\r\nno less distinction and ceremony than in France. In a courtly manner he\r\nconveyed to the Ambassador that he would be deeply mortified if he were\r\nnot given the opportunity of paying his respects personally to Queen\r\nVictoria, and his ministers laid great stress upon the desirability of\r\nHis Majesty being received by the Lord Mayor, the importance of that\r\nmagnate standing apparently as high in the estimation of the Oriental as\r\nof the Frenchman. The mingled pleasure, alarm, and agitation evoked by\r\nthe Sultan's intended visit are well illustrated by the following letter\r\nto Lord Lyons from a man who seemed marked out to add to the gaiety of\r\nnations, Mr. Hammond.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, May 30, 1867.\r\n\r\n    We should like to know as soon as possible at what time we may\r\n    calculate on seeing the Sultan and what members of his family or of\r\n    his Government he brings with him, and the rank and description of\r\n    his suite and their numbers. It is to be hoped they will not be too\r\n    numerous, and that as he is to be lodged in the Palace, the usual\r\n    habits of Orientalism will for the time be laid aside and the\r\n    services of his Harem be dispensed with during his visit. It would\r\n    shock the people in this country to hear of the Sultan being\r\n    attended by persons not proper to be mentioned in civilized society,\r\n    and no small inconvenience might result if he was known to have\r\n    slaves in his suite, for it would be impossible to answer for the\r\n    enthusiasts of Exeter Hall with so fair an opportunity before them\r\n    for displaying their zeal and doing mischief.\r\n\r\n    Aali Pasha has, I think, been in England, and you might have means\r\n    of bringing these little matters before him in such a delicate way\r\n    as not to shock the Sultan's ideas of propriety or mastery. The\r\n    French probably would not be so particular in these respects, but\r\n    they have not Writs of Habeas Corpus dangling before their eyes, nor\r\n    unrestricted liberty of speech and print to provide against.\r\n\r\n    Whatever information you can give us of the Sultan's habits of\r\n    living and of the sort of accommodation he will require will be very\r\n    acceptable to the Lord Chamberlain's office, and any hints as to\r\n    what it would most interest him to see would be valuable.\r\n\r\n    In London, you know, we have no manufactories, but there are the\r\n    Arsenal at Woolwich; the large private shipbuilding yards in the\r\n    Thames, if he did not care to go to Portsmouth for a day; the\r\n    Museum, Bank, Post Office and some few things of that sort which are\r\n    probably peculiar in their extent to this country. It might also\r\n    interest him, if he is a reformer, to see our prisons, from which he\r\n    might take useful hints. Does he keep reasonable hours, and would he\r\n    be shocked at balls, or restrain himself from throwing a\r\n    handkerchief at any beauty that might cross his path?\r\n\r\nSultan Abdul Aziz's visit to England passed off without administering\r\nany of those shocks to public feeling which Mr. Hammond contemplated\r\nwith so much alarm. There are no means of ascertaining what precise\r\neffects were produced upon the Sultan's mind, but it is to be presumed\r\nthat the object lesson afforded by an English prison was wasted upon\r\nhim, for anything more unlike an English prison than a Turkish gaol it\r\nwould be difficult to imagine. The ill-fated Abdul Aziz was accompanied\r\non this journey by his young nephew, destined to become famous\r\nsubsequently as Abdul Hamid II., but he, too, has kept his impressions\r\nto himself, and the only topic upon which he has been known to\r\nexpatiate, is the excellence of English servants, who 'always treated\r\nhim in a fatherly manner.'\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Lord Lyons's stay at Constantinople was drawing to a\r\nclose, for at the end of April, Lord Stanley had offered him the Embassy\r\nat Paris. The offer was made in highly flattering terms, the Foreign\r\nSecretary expressing his regret at withdrawing the Ambassador from an\r\nimportant post, the duties of which he so thoroughly understood, but\r\nadding that Paris was the first place in the diplomatic service, and\r\nthat the Eastern Question seemed likely to be superseded by even more\r\nserious difficulties nearer home. It is probable that the honour was all\r\nthe more appreciated because it was unsolicited and unexpected, as shown\r\nby the following letter from him to Lord Cowley.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Constantinople, May 8, 1867.\r\n\r\n    When I first heard that you were likely to give up Paris, I felt, as\r\n    I think I said in my letter to you, alarmed at the prospect of the\r\n    Embassy's falling into other hands. I should have been indeed\r\n    alarmed had I then known into what hands it was likely to fall. I\r\n    received on the 3rd a letter from Lord Stanley offering it to me. I\r\n    have accepted in deference to my father's often repeated injunction\r\n    never to refuse promotion, but I confess I am full of misgivings and\r\n    anxieties. I had heard nothing whatever from the Foreign Office till\r\n    I received Lord Stanley's letter last week.\r\n\r\nThe appointment, when it became known publicly, was generally approved,\r\nand no one wrote in warmer terms of congratulation than Lord Clarendon,\r\nwho had been Lord Stanley's predecessor at the Foreign Office, and who\r\nstated that he had himself suggested Lord Lyons to his successor as the\r\nmost suitable man for the post.\r\n\r\nThus, at the comparatively early age of fifty he had attained the\r\nhighest place in the British diplomatic service.\r\n\r\nAs regards Lord Lyons's two years occupation of the Constantinople\r\nEmbassy, it has already been pointed out that the period was one of\r\ncomparative calm, and that there were no sensational questions to be\r\ndealt with. Unlike some of his predecessors and successors, he had not\r\nbeen instructed to make any change in the policy pursued by the British\r\nGovernment towards Turkey, and it had not fallen to his lot to be forced\r\nto adopt a threatening and aggressive attitude. Consequently, his\r\nexperiences of Constantinople were agreeable and unexciting; his\r\nrelations with the Turkish Ministers and with his colleagues had been\r\nsingularly amicable, and he left the place with regret. It would be\r\naffectation to claim that his stay there left any permanent mark upon\r\nour policy in the East, but there were two minor matters in which his\r\ninfluence made itself felt. Entertaining a profound dislike to intrigue\r\nand tortuous methods, he made it his business to diminish as much as\r\npossible the so-called Dragoman system and to substitute for it a\r\ndifferent and more open method of transacting the business of the\r\nEmbassy. The other matter related to the practice of extorting favours\r\nand concessions from the Porte. It has always been the tradition of\r\nBritish diplomacy in the East, and it may perhaps be said to be unique\r\nin this respect, that the influence of the Ambassador should not be used\r\nto procure concessions, honours, or favours on behalf of British\r\nsubjects. Upon this point he carried the principle of abstention to\r\nalmost extravagant lengths, as the following incident shows. The\r\ndaughter of a gentleman connected with the Embassy was about to be\r\nmarried, and the newspaper _La Turquie_ announced that the Sultan had\r\nsent a magnificent present. The announcement caught the eye of the\r\nvigilant ambassador, who immediately wrote to the father:\r\n\r\n    I think you will do well to take steps to remove the unfavourable\r\n    impression which this paragraph cannot but make. There can be little\r\n    if any difference between such a present and one made directly to\r\n    yourself; and the most friendly course I can take is to advise you\r\n    to prevent the acceptance of it, and to have a paragraph inserted in\r\n    the _Turquie_ explaining that it has not been retained.\r\n\r\nThis must have been singularly unpleasant for all parties, and it is\r\nquite likely that the Ambassador found himself morally bound to\r\ncompensate the lady by making an equally magnificent present as a\r\nsubstitute for the Sultan's rejected gift.\r\n\r\nAn application to support a concession to Mr. Brassey for the\r\nconstruction of a railway from Constantinople to Adrianople met with no\r\nfavour at all. He explained that he was constantly applied to in order\r\nto support all sorts of concessions for railways and similar\r\nundertakings, and that his practice was to reply that it was not his\r\nbusiness to meddle in such matters unless instructed to do so by the\r\nForeign Office, and that concessionaires should therefore in the first\r\nplace address themselves to the Home Government. 'The fact is that there\r\nis often much dirty work connected with the management of such matters\r\nat the Porte, and I wish to be clear of them.' Over and over again there\r\nappears in his letters the emphatic statement that he 'refuses to take\r\npart in the dirty work by which European speculators are apt to get\r\nconcessions out of the Turks.'\r\n\r\nIt would not be difficult to find arguments against this attitude, which\r\nin these days of increased international competition it would be\r\nimpossible rigidly to maintain, but the views which prevailed fifty\r\nyears ago with regard to the abstention of British diplomacy from every\r\nspecies of concession mongering probably did more than anything else to\r\ninspire Orientals with a belief in our integrity as a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [5] Lord Clarendon, upon the death of Lord Palmerston, became Foreign\r\n  Secretary in place of Lord Russell.\r\n\r\n  [6] British minister at Bucharest.\r\n\r\n  [7] Lord Lyons to Mr. Stuart.\r\n\r\n  [8] In consequence of the change of Government, Lord Stanley\r\n  (subsequently Earl of Derby) had now become Foreign Secretary.\r\n\r\n  [9] It used to be said that it took a Franco-German war to secure the\r\n  correct spelling of this name.

He arrived at a time when, although the\r\noutward splendour of the Empire still dazzled the popular imagination,\r\nthe prestige, influence, and popularity of the Imperial Government, and\r\nmore especially of the Emperor himself, had suffered a series of\r\ndisastrous shocks. If Napoleon III.'s career had ended in 1862 he would\r\npresumably have left a great name in history and a record of brilliant\r\nsuccesses; after that period, however, everything seemed to go wrong for\r\nhim. Poland, the Danish War, and the Austro-Prussian War had shown that\r\nhis pretension to control the policy of Europe had practically vanished;\r\nthe incomprehensible Mexican enterprise had ended in disaster and\r\ndisgrace, and to add to these glaring failures in foreign policy there\r\nwas deep-seated discontent at home. In the autumn of 1867 a fresh\r\nembarrassment to France was created by the action of Garibaldi, who\r\nsucceeded in embroiling two Governments which had latterly been on most\r\nfriendly terms. The alliance between Italy and Prussia in 1866 had been\r\na temporary expedient only; the sympathies of Victor Emmanuel had always\r\nbeen on the side of France, and when at the close of that year, the\r\nEmperor decided upon the withdrawal of his troops from Rome, it seemed\r\nnot improbable that a permanent alliance between Italy and France might\r\nbe effected. This combination was defeated by the action of Garibaldi in\r\ninvading the Papal States, and the Emperor, dominated by the clerical\r\nparty, found himself compelled not only to use threatening language\r\ntowards the Italian Government, but to send a French expedition to\r\nre-occupy Rome and defend the Pope against his enemies. Mentana was the\r\nresult, and it soon became plain that the policy of the French\r\nGovernment was to prevent Italy from obtaining possession of Rome, M.\r\nRouher, the French Prime Minister, at a subsequent period going so far\r\nas to declare that France would never tolerate such an outrage on its\r\nhonour. In spite of all this, signs were not wanting that there was no\r\ndesire on the part of either France or Italy to go to war. Mentana had\r\ncleared the air, and the chief danger seemed to consist in the renewed\r\nFrench occupation of Rome. As Lord Stanley pointed out, it was\r\ncomparatively easy for the Emperor to go to Rome, but the difficulty lay\r\nin getting out again, for who was to keep order after the evacuation?\r\nNapoleon III. had, in fact, released himself from momentary\r\nembarrassments at the cost of heavy trouble in the future. In accordance\r\nwith his favourite practice, he now made the proposal that the so-called\r\nRoman Question should be submitted to a Conference of the Powers at\r\nParis--a proposal which did not commend itself to England, and was\r\nopposed by Prussia at the instigation of Bismarck, whose object it was\r\nto accentuate the differences between France and Italy. To what extent\r\nthe Empress Eugénie participated in the direction of French foreign\r\npolicy has often been the subject of discussion, but there can be no\r\ndoubt that she held decided views with regard to the Roman Question and\r\nthe proposed Conference.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 11, 1867.\r\n\r\n    After I had presented the Queen's letter this morning, the Empress\r\n    kept me in conversation for an hour. She began by expressing in warm\r\n    terms respect and affection for the Queen and in particular\r\n    gratitude for Her Majesty's kind reception of her at the last visit.\r\n\r\n    The Empress proceeded to speak of the Roman question and insisted\r\n    strongly on the necessity for a Conference and on the importance and\r\n    propriety of non-Catholic as well as Catholic powers taking part in\r\n    it. She expressed a very strong desire that England should not stand\r\n    aloof.\r\n\r\n    Without taking upon myself to anticipate your decision on the\r\n    matter, I endeavoured to make the Empress aware of the very great\r\n    difficulty and delicacy of a Conference to us. It appeared to result\r\n    from that. Her Majesty said that, in her own opinion, the proper\r\n    basis for the deliberations would be the maintenance of the _status\r\n    quo_. This, she seemed to think, would be a fair compromise between\r\n    the demand of the Pope that all the provinces he had lost should be\r\n    restored to him and the pretensions of Italy to Rome itself.\r\n\r\n    The conversation having been brought round to the measures to be\r\n    taken immediately, I endeavoured to impress upon the Empress the\r\n    advantage of withdrawing the troops without a day's unnecessary\r\n    delay, if not from the Roman territory altogether, at least from\r\n    Rome itself. Her Majesty said that there was nothing in principle\r\n    against withdrawing to Civita Vecchia at once, and that certainly\r\n    the Emperor and she herself were anxious to bring all the troops\r\n    back to France as soon as it was safe to do so.\r\n\r\n    The Empress spoke discouragingly of the state of Italy--of the\r\n    little progress that had been made towards uniting and assimilating\r\n    the various sections of the population--of the financial\r\n    difficulties and other unfavourable points. She said however that\r\n    the unity of Italy had been the work of the Emperor, and that it\r\n    would be absurd and disadvantageous to allow it to be destroyed. She\r\n    believed that the French expedition had in reality been of as much\r\n    or more service to King Victor Emmanuel than to the Pope. His\r\n    Majesty's throne was threatened, she thought, by the revolutionary\r\n    party quite as much as was the Temporal power of the Pope.\r\n\r\n    Among a great variety of topics which came up, the Empress spoke, by\r\n    way of an illustration, of the Kingdom of Greece. She said it had\r\n    been a mistake, if that Kingdom was to be created at all, not to\r\n    give it territory enough to enable it to exist. She did not however\r\n    seem to think it would be advisable at this moment to make over\r\n    Crete or any other Ottoman province to Greece. She appeared to be\r\n    aware of the extreme peril to the whole Ottoman Empire of detaching\r\n    any portion of it in this way.\r\n\r\n    The Empress spoke with much grace both of manner and of expression,\r\n    and I think with very great ability.\r\n\r\n    For my own part I endeavoured principally to make an impression on\r\n    her mind respecting the immediate withdrawal of the troops to Civita\r\n    Vecchia at least, and I am inclined to think that I succeeded so far\r\n    as to ensure the repeating to the Emperor what I said on this point.\r\n\r\n    I hear from all quarters that the Emperor's own position in France\r\n    becomes more and more critical. Every one seems to admit that he\r\n    could not do otherwise than send the expedition to Rome, but the\r\n    success which attended it does not seem to have made much\r\n    impression. All parties except the ultra-clerical appear to desire\r\n    to get out of the intervention as soon as possible. So far as I can\r\n    make out, the weakness of the Emperor's position lies simply in\r\n    loss of prestige arising partly from his want of success on many\r\n    recent occasions, and mainly, I imagine, from the inconstancy of men\r\n    and Frenchmen in particular. In fact he has reigned eighteen years,\r\n    and they are getting tired of so much of the same thing and want\r\n    novelty.\r\n\r\nLord Stanley's comment upon this letter was that the Empress's 'frank\r\nand sensible conversation' furnished the best reason he had received yet\r\nfor keeping out of the affair altogether, and he observed with some\r\njustice that what Her Majesty's proposed compromise amounted to, was\r\nthat the Pope should keep all that he had already, and merely renounce\r\nhis claim to what, under no circumstances, he could ever hope to\r\nrecover. The more he considered the proposed Conference the more\r\nhopeless it appeared to him. There was no plan, nothing settled, no\r\nassurance that there was even a wish for agreement amongst the Powers\r\ninterested. They were being asked to discuss a question on which they\r\nwere certain to differ, and the sole reason given for summoning a\r\nConference was that the Emperor disliked bearing the responsibility\r\nwhich he had assumed. Why should we be asked to bear it for him? It must\r\nhave been a congenial task for a man of Lord Stanley's temperament to\r\nthrow cold water upon the vague and slipshod proposals of the unlucky\r\nEmperor, and he was probably fortified in his conclusions by the\r\nattitude of Prussia and by the reluctance of Russia, in spite of a\r\nConference being 'always a temptation to Gortschakoff.'[11]\r\n\r\nAnother personage of some importance, Prince Napoleon, also held decided\r\nviews upon the Roman question, which he imparted to the Ambassador in\r\nthe hope that they would thus be brought before the Emperor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Nov. 15, 1867.\r\n\r\n    I have had a long interview with Prince Napoleon this afternoon. He\r\n    does not desire that England should agree to the Conference. He\r\n    thinks that the best service England could render to the Emperor\r\n    would be to advise him to give up the idea of a Conference and\r\n    settle the matter with Italy, by satisfying, at least in a certain\r\n    measure, Italian aspirations. He declares that Italy will never be\r\n    quiet, and that the unity of Italy will never be assured until she\r\n    gets Rome for her capital. He believes that the Emperor's support of\r\n    the Pope is very unpopular with the great majority of the French\r\n    people, and that it will, if persevered in, be a serious danger to\r\n    the dynasty. He takes a gloomy view altogether of the state of\r\n    feeling in France, and thinks that the Emperor will not be able to\r\n    hold his own, unless he abandons the system of personal government\r\n    and gives a large increase of liberty. He wishes England to give\r\n    this advice to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n    He volunteered to say all this to me and entered into a great many\r\n    details. He spoke with great animation and remarkably well.\r\n\r\n    My share of the conversation was but small. I think the advice which\r\n    the Prince wishes us to give to the Emperor would be sound in\r\n    itself, but that it would produce no good effect, unless His Majesty\r\n    felt that he was in a strait, and asked our opinion. I am myself\r\n    very little inclined to thrust advice upon him out of season.\r\n\r\nPrince Napoleon on this and, as will be seen, on subsequent occasions,\r\nshowed that his judgment was remarkably correct, but it is not probable\r\nthat his Imperial cousin benefited by his sage advice, for Lord Stanley\r\nagreed that it was undesirable that the British Government should become\r\nthe channel of his opinions. Both he and the Ambassador, however,\r\nthoroughly realized that the Emperor had no fixed plan, and was merely\r\nfollowing his usual hand-to-mouth policy of staving off present at the\r\ncost of future embarrassments.\r\n\r\nNapoleon's vague and unpractical views were exposed in a conversation\r\nwith Lord Lyons, which apparently took place in a crowded ball-room.\r\nAsked what was to be the basis of the Conference, he made the cryptic\r\nreply: '_Mon Dieu! la base est d'assimiler le pouvoir du Pape à\r\nl'Italie_,' which sounds like unadulterated nonsense; and when pressed\r\nto explain how an unpalatable decision was to be enforced upon a\r\nrecalcitrant Pope, His Majesty was only able feebly to suggest 'moral\r\ninfluence.' Nevertheless, he showed no ill-feeling, and, with habitual\r\ngood nature, addressed no reproaches to the Ambassador with regard to\r\nthe unsympathetic attitude of Her Majesty's Government. In spite of many\r\nrebuffs and discouragements, the Emperor and his ministers continued to\r\nlabour on behalf of their ill-starred project with an energy worthy of a\r\nbetter cause; but circumstances were eventually too strong for them. The\r\nreal opponent all along had been Prussia, and the aim of the Prussian\r\nGovernment was to throw the blame on to England. The French were well\r\naware of the fact, and did not consequently display ill-will towards us,\r\nand it seems to have been the speech of M. Rouher, already referred to,\r\nwhich made it clear that a Conference would be little better than a\r\nwaste of time; for when the Italians asked for an explanation they were\r\ninformed that M. Rouher's speech only asserted more emphatically what\r\nhad been said before. Meanwhile the French troops continued to remain at\r\nRome, although King Victor Emmanuel complained bitterly to Lord Clarendon\r\nof their presence and declared that, should they be withdrawn, he would\r\nundertake that there should be no aggressive action against the Pope.\r\nThe erroneous impression which influenced French policy with regard to\r\nthe Papacy was explained in a letter to Lord Lyons from that acute\r\nobserver, Mr. Odo Russell,[12] who was the British representative at Rome\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Rome, Dec. 10, 1867.\r\n\r\n    Cardinal Antonelli constantly talks of you with affection and\r\n    respect and often expresses his desire to see you again.\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for your letter of the 4th about a preliminary\r\n    conference. Rouher's speech, I take it, has put an end to all\r\n    that--at least so Cardinal Antonelli tells me--and the joy caused at\r\n    the Vatican that France will never allow Italy to hold Rome is\r\n    immense.\r\n\r\n    You are perfectly right in not thinking that the Court of Rome has\r\n    changed since you were here.\r\n\r\n    French diplomatists and statesmen are but too apt to interpret the\r\n    clear and precise language of the Court of Rome according to their\r\n    own wishes and to think and proclaim that the Pope will adopt and\r\n    follow the wise counsels of France, etc. etc.\r\n\r\n    Now I say, give the Pope his due, and at least give him credit for\r\n    being consistent, whether you agree with him or not.\r\n\r\n    In the long run, an Italian priest will always outwit a French\r\n    statesman, and no Frenchman can resist the influence of Rome. A\r\n    year's residence suffices to make him more Papal than the Pope, whom\r\n    he fondly believes to be a French institution under the immediate\r\n    control of the French clergy.\r\n\r\n    I have often marvelled at French notions of the Papacy, and now it\r\n    has grown the fashion to mistake the cause of the Pope for that of\r\n    France, even among men who might know better.\r\n\r\n    A permanent French occupation is the only possible machinery by\r\n    which the Temporal Power can be imposed on Italy. The national\r\n    feeling against the Temporal Power is certainly much stronger than I\r\n    myself thought in Italy, and the bitter hostility of the Romans has\r\n    been proved by the hideous means employed by them to destroy life\r\n    and property in the October conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of these views was sufficiently demonstrated in 1870.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year Prince Napoleon made another of his frequent\r\nappearances at the Embassy, and announced that he looked upon a war with\r\nGermany in the spring as certain. He considered that there were only two\r\ncourses which could have been taken with prudence--the one to resist the\r\naggrandizement of Prussia immediately after Sadowa--the other to accept\r\nit with favour; what had been done had merely caused so much irritation\r\nthat France would eventually be forced into war. He denounced Thiers,\r\nwho, while pretending to advocate peace, was always crying out that\r\nFrance was being wronged and humiliated, and thought that even a\r\nsuccessful war would be full of danger to the Empire. Apparently his own\r\npolicy was to unite with Italy against the Pope and establish liberal\r\ninstitutions in France, a course which the Emperor had now rendered it\r\nimpossible to adopt, as he had committed himself to the Pope, and was\r\nnot likely to play the part of a Constitutional monarch after eighteen\r\nyears of absolute power. 'He speaks very well, and with a good deal of\r\nanimation,' wrote Lord Lyons, 'and his opinions sound much better as he\r\ndelivers them than they read as I write them.' But, making every\r\nallowance for exuberant verbosity, this Prince seems to have held much\r\nsounder and more definite opinions than his Imperial relative.\r\n\r\nNot long after Prince Napoleon came the Foreign Minister, M. de\r\nMoustier, with his story.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 16, 1868.\r\n\r\n    M. de Moustier says that the reports he receives from Berlin and\r\n    other quarters confirm his impression that Prussia is averse to a\r\n    war with France; that the relations between Austria and Prussia are\r\n    improving, and that such being the case Prussia is awakening to a\r\n    sense of the danger of Russian designs in Eastern Europe. On the\r\n    other hand he says that Baron Brunnow gives the most positive\r\n    assurances that Russia will do nothing against Turkey. He trusts\r\n    that these assurances may be depended upon, but he thinks that the\r\n    Russian Government uses its ambassadors as screens, behind which to\r\n    carry on its own manoeuvres.\r\n\r\n    Nigra, the Italian Minister here, tells me that his last news from\r\n    Florence gives him strong hopes that the Menabrea Ministry will\r\n    maintain itself. I presume that the object of Italy should be to\r\n    convince the Emperor that Rome will be safe without the French\r\n    troops--I mean to make the Emperor himself really confident of it.\r\n    This done, I suppose diplomacy is capable of devising some formal\r\n    guarantees to satisfy the French public. I do not believe that\r\n    France has as yet done more than hinted at some security that Italy\r\n    will take her side, if she quarrels with Prussia. I do not know that\r\n    she has even hinted at anything of the kind. A demand for an\r\n    engagement of this sort would be unreasonable and probably futile.\r\n    If France is ever hard pressed by Prussia, the Italians will go to\r\n    Rome unless some other Powers step forward to bar the way. At all\r\n    events, it will not be by promises extracted beforehand that they\r\n    will be stopped.\r\n\r\n    The real danger to Europe appears however to be in the difficulties\r\n    of the Emperor Napoleon at home. The discontent is great and the\r\n    distress amongst the working classes severe. The great measure of\r\n    the session, the new Conscription Act, is very unpopular. There is\r\n    no glitter at home or abroad to divert public attention, and the\r\n    French have been a good many years without the excitement of a\r\n    change. I think that Europe, and England in particular, are more\r\n    interested in maintaining the Emperor, than in almost anything else.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of this forecast, like that of Mr. Odo Russell, was also\r\ndemonstrated in 1870, when, upon the retirement of the French garrison,\r\nthe Italian troops marched into Rome, and the temporal power of the Pope\r\ncame to an end. It is not, however, altogether fair to place the whole\r\nresponsibility for the collapse of French policy in Italy upon Napoleon\r\nIII., for whereas he was no doubt personally in favour of an united\r\nItaly; there was a strong party in France which was strongly\r\nopposed to it, and convinced that French interests lay in a divided\r\ncountry. The mention of Russia in the above letter makes the following\r\nremarkable communication not inappropriate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 22, 1868.\r\n\r\n    The Emperor told me last night that his Ambassador at St. Petersburg\r\n    had had a curious conversation with the Emperor Alexander.\r\n\r\n    The Emperor Alexander had, he said, asked the Ambassador whether the\r\n    French Government were fully aware of the extent of the plot which\r\n    was actively carried on for the destruction of all the monarchical\r\n    governments in Europe, and the assassination of sovereigns and Royal\r\n    families. After giving some details His Majesty had suggested to\r\n    the Ambassador that the several Governments should communicate\r\n    information to each other and unite their efforts to defend\r\n    themselves.\r\n\r\n    The Emperor Napoleon proceeded to tell me that it was asserted that\r\n    the first and principal attempt was to be made in England; that the\r\n    palaces and public buildings were to be blown up, and the Queen and\r\n    Royal Family seized and put on board a steamer in the Thames and\r\n    'disposed of.' The Emperor Napoleon went on to say that the supposed\r\n    details of the scheme to overthrow the Government of England were of\r\n    course absurd, but he seemed to intend to suggest that we should be\r\n    vigilant, and that he himself would be glad to co-operate with us.\r\n    He said that Mazzini, who had let him alone for some time, had now\r\n    again taken up the idea of assassinating him, and was busily\r\n    employed in making plans for effecting their purpose. He told me\r\n    that Mazzini was very ill and he did not express any wish for his\r\n    recovery.\r\n\r\n    The Emperor talked to me a long time and related to me interesting\r\n    anecdotes, some very amusing, of the conduct of various persons\r\n    towards him in past times.\r\n\r\nCheap sensational magazines were not in existence in 1868, or one would\r\nbe disposed to infer that the Emperor Alexander had been indulging in\r\nthis species of literature, since it seems difficult otherwise to\r\naccount for such credulity in high places. As for the Emperor Napoleon's\r\nanecdotes of his youth, they are unfortunately denied to the world, for\r\nthe most distressing feature in Lord Lyons's correspondence is the\r\nalmost complete absence of anything in the nature of indiscretions. The\r\nconversation, however, serves to show on what intimate terms he already\r\nstood with Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, letters received from Lord Stanley show that the British\r\nGovernment was feeling some uneasiness with regard to America, more\r\nespecially in connection with the _Alabama_ question, and, as now was\r\nfrequently the case, Lord Lyons's advice was requested on various\r\npoints. As to the general policy which should be pursued, he reiterated\r\nhis former opinion that the chief danger consisted in the belief of the\r\nordinary American politician that England would submit to anything\r\nrather than fight. Neither party would wish to have the responsibility\r\nof actually making war with England, but each party would very much like\r\nto be able to boast of having made her yield without fighting, and would\r\nvie with each other in calling for unreasonable concessions if they\r\nthought there was any chance of obtaining them. The best chance,\r\ntherefore, of keeping the peace was to be very firm and uncompromising\r\nin questions of arrests and other measures necessary for putting down\r\nFenianism, as these were manifestly well grounded, and the rights of the\r\nsame kind so frequently claimed and exercised by the Americans during\r\nthe war had never been contested. In anything doubtful, we should be\r\nmild and conciliatory--not that mildness and conciliation would make\r\nmuch impression in America--but in order to satisfy a section of the\r\nBritish public. The present danger, he considered, lay in the\r\nover-conciliatory, over-yielding tone of a great number of English\r\nwriters and public men, which might lead the Americans to fancy they\r\nwould be quite safe in pushing us into a corner, and so bring about a\r\nstate of things which would render a fight unavoidable. As for the\r\n_Alabama_ question, he urged that the more quietly the claims were\r\ndiscussed, the more satisfactory the result was likely to be, and he\r\nstrongly advised that the discussion should take place in Europe\r\nrather than in the United States: it would be a mistake to send a\r\n_mission d'éclat_ to Washington, as such a mission would be taken as a\r\nsurrender at discretion. Whether the mission of Lord Ripon and his\r\ncolleagues to Washington three years later could be correctly described\r\nas a _mission d'éclat_ or not is of little importance, but it certainty\r\nended in surrender.\r\n\r\nThe letters from Paris about this period abound in misgivings as to the\r\npolitical situation in France. The conviction was becoming general that\r\nthe Bonaparte dynasty was too weak to stand any shock. The Emperor, it\r\nwas true, began to show indications of proceeding gradually towards\r\nParliamentary government, in the hope of founding a state of things\r\nwhich might render the position tenable on his death for his son, but it\r\nseemed more probable that the progress might be too slow for the object.\r\nTowards the end of February some apprehension was created by a\r\ncircumstantial rumour that the Emperor had announced positively to\r\nRussia that France would not allow the annexation of the Grand Duchy of\r\nBaden to the North German Confederation, and a month later a vague fear\r\nwas felt of the imminence of a _coup de théâtre_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 27, 1868.\r\n\r\n    I ought to say that there are, among not unreasonable or\r\n    inexperienced people, vague apprehensions that the Emperor may,\r\n    _more suo_, resort to a _coup de théâtre_ and declare war when it is\r\n    least expected. The only act which can be cited in support of these\r\n    apprehensions is the formation of two more camps of instruction this\r\n    year than usual. It is said that the effect of this will be to have\r\n    two additional army corps ready to take the field at short notice.\r\n    But the real ground of the apprehension appears to be a resemblance\r\n    real or fancied between the declaration and proceedings of the\r\n    Emperor now, and those which preceded the war with Italy. I believe\r\n    it to be true that Prince Napoleon has told the Emperor that war\r\n    with Germany must be made this year or never, but I do not think the\r\n    Prince advises the war being made at all. The general impression\r\n    indeed here appears to be that there is at this moment an amount of\r\n    discontent in the annexed provinces which might be turned to account\r\n    now by France, but which will subside in a year's time, if the\r\n    Prussian Government is left to carry into effect its plans. Southern\r\n    Germany, it is thought, would go with France _after_ a French\r\n    victory, but not without one. For my own part I am more inclined to\r\n    believe that the Emperor is sincerely anxious to preserve peace. In\r\n    case of war he must take the field in person, and it is much doubted\r\n    whether he is willing or able to endure the mental and bodily\r\n    fatigue of a campaign. Defeat would be fatal and anything short of\r\n    great success and additions of territory far from advantageous. It\r\n    is of course impossible to say what a man so reserved and really so\r\n    little in the habit of making up his mind long beforehand, may or\r\n    may not do, and therefore the possibility of a _coup de théâtre_\r\n    must I suppose always be kept in one's mind. Still I must say that\r\n    all I can make out leads me to believe that his present wishes and\r\n    intentions are peaceful.\r\n\r\nA good deal of interest had been aroused by a visit of Prince Napoleon\r\nto Germany in the spring, which gave rise to much speculation in the\r\npolitical world. His friends gave out that it was merely an ordinary\r\ntour. Others, who were supposed to be well informed, declared (probably\r\nmuch to the satisfaction of the Prince) that he had been sent on a\r\nprivate mission from the Emperor, of which none of His Majesty's\r\nMinisters had any cognizance. Two different objects were assigned to the\r\nmission; one that he was commissioned to assure Bismarck of the\r\nEmperor's determination to remain at peace if possible, but to represent\r\nthat Bismarck should act so as to make it easy, and should not use the\r\npresumed hostility of France so frequently as a lever to move public\r\nopinion in Germany. The other and less probable object with which he was\r\ncredited, was that he was to summon Prussia to join France against Russia\r\nin Turkey, a fantastic absurdity which was directly contrary to\r\nMoustier's policy in the East. The probability is that Prince Napoleon\r\nhad no mission at all, but the long letter which follows is interesting\r\nas showing what correct conclusions an intelligent person can\r\noccasionally draw from a well-timed visit to a foreign country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 31, 1868.\r\n\r\n    Although I have not seen Prince Napoleon myself since his return\r\n    from Germany, I think I can give you a tolerably accurate notion of\r\n    the language he holds.\r\n\r\n    He speaks with satisfaction of the manner in which he was himself\r\n    received at Berlin. He thinks that Count Bismarck will not provoke\r\n    France to war by increasing at present the area of the North German\r\n    Confederation, or any other overt act. He believes him to be\r\n    sincerely desirous of avoiding a war, but not to be willing to allow\r\n    any interference on the part of France in the affairs of Northern\r\n    Germany, or to make any patent concession whatever to France. He\r\n    conceived it to be vain to talk to Prussia of disarmament, as she\r\n    would answer that she was already disarmed, having only 200,000 men\r\n    under arms. Her system, which would enable her to put from 4 to\r\n    600,000 men in a condition to take the field in eight or ten days,\r\n    she could not be persuaded to change.\r\n\r\n    The Prince has seen nothing, except in the United States, like\r\n    the contempt in which foreign nations are held in Prussia. Austria\r\n    is not considered to be worth taking into account at all. Great\r\n    indifference is professed as to Italy and Turkey. The Prince does\r\n    not believe that there is any formal treaty between Russia and\r\n    Prussia, but is convinced that there is an understanding that, in\r\n    return for a friendly neutrality in the West, Prussia is, in case of\r\n    being at war with France, to give Russia free scope in the East.\r\n\r\n    The Prince gives no weight to the assertions that the recently\r\n    annexed provinces would see with pleasure an attack by France upon\r\n    Prussia and use it to recover their independence. He is not blind to\r\n    the discontent which prevails among a great part of the populations\r\n    in those provinces, but he is convinced that an attack from abroad\r\n    would rouse an almost universal spirit of resistance in Germany\r\n    which would extend even to the German possession of Austria. The\r\n    allegations to the contrary come from adherents of the dispossessed\r\n    dynasties, who fancy that their own peculiar feelings are the\r\n    feelings of the mass of their countrymen. The Saxon army might\r\n    possibly be a danger to the Prussians, if the Prussians should be\r\n    defeated, and in that event, Bavaria and Wurtemberg might also\r\n    support France. But they would none of them do anything for France\r\n    until she had gained so decided a victory as to have no need of\r\n    them. In Saxony the Prince found the army to be ill-disposed to\r\n    Prussia, but not the commercial classes.\r\n\r\n    The Prince has not come back with the idea that France could easily\r\n    attempt to annex Rhenish Prussia. He believes that the inhabitants\r\n    are now prosperous and contented and better off than they would be\r\n    under France with her present institutions. Cologne might turn out\r\n    to be another Saragossa to France. The case might in his opinion be\r\n    different in the Palatinate, and France would, he supposes, have\r\n    little difficulty in 'assimilating' Belgium if she obtained\r\n    possession of that country.\r\n\r\n    So far the impressions brought back by the Prince are calculated to\r\n    show that the policy of France should be to remain at peace, and his\r\n    language to the Emperor may have had a good effect. But he has also\r\n    said to the Emperor and others that a war with Prussia should be\r\n    made this year or never; that the consolidation of Germany is\r\n    proceeding surely and rapidly; that the adhesion of Southern Germany\r\n    will soon follow, and that hereafter war would have to be waged with\r\n    a Germany thoroughly united and perfectly organized.\r\n\r\n    Prince Napoleon is himself opposed to war. He considers that an\r\n    unsuccessful war would overthrow the Emperor and his dynasty and\r\n    send the whole Bonaparte family to the right about. A war only\r\n    partially successful would, he thinks, rather weaken than strengthen\r\n    the Emperor at home, while a thoroughly successful war would simply\r\n    give His Majesty a fresh lease of 'Cæsarism' and adjourn\r\n    indefinitely the liberal institutions which he considers essential\r\n    to the durability of the dynasty. At the same time the Prince is not\r\n    without apprehension as to war being made this season. He fears weak\r\n    men, and he looks upon the Emperor as a weak man. He fears the\r\n    people who surround His Majesty, the Generals, the Chamberlains, the\r\n    ladies of the Palace. It has been particularly observed that while\r\n    the Prince has been very communicative as to the opinions expressed\r\n    by him to the Emperor, he has been, contrary to his wont, wholly\r\n    silent as to what the Emperor said to him.\r\n\r\nThis account of Prince Napoleon's views was derived from Colonel\r\nClaremont, the British Military Attaché, who was on intimate terms with\r\nhim. Prince Napoleon, one of the best abused and most unpopular of\r\nFrenchmen, had, with all his talents, little fixity of purpose, no real\r\nperseverance, and was too much wanting in courage to become the head of\r\na party; but the insight which he displayed with regard to the real\r\nsituation between France and Prussia is really remarkable. There is\r\nhardly a single opinion, in the letter quoted above, which was not shown\r\nsubsequently to be absolutely accurate and well founded, and one cannot\r\nhelp suspecting that he afterwards must have derived some melancholy\r\nconsolation from the realization of his prophecies of evil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Prince Napoleon._\r\n\r\nLONDON EDWARD ARNOLD]\r\n\r\nThe general uneasiness which was felt in France, and to which constant\r\nallusion is made in private letters and in despatches, was in no way\r\nallayed by the pacific declarations of the Emperor, which seem, indeed,\r\nto have made an effect exactly contrary to what was intended. It was in\r\nvain that ministers made reassuring statements; bankers and capitalists\r\nhad lost confidence in the maintenance of peace, and, although the\r\ndiplomatic world was quiet, the public was convinced that war was\r\nimminent. The one thing that was certain was that France was preparing\r\nfor a war of some kind, and the suspicions of Lord Stanley were aroused\r\nby a request from Moustier that Her Majesty's Government should 'give\r\nadvice' to the Prussian Government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Stanley to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, April 14, 1868.\r\n\r\n    You will receive from me to-day a despatch which seems to confirm in\r\n    some degree the apprehensions so generally felt at Paris. It may\r\n    mean less than it appears to imply, but a warning given at Berlin\r\n    that any attempt or any measure tending towards the annexation of\r\n    the South German states will be regarded unfavourably at Paris,\r\n    is so like a threat that one cannot help feeling anxious as to the\r\n    result, and how it can be conveyed in language which will not be\r\n    considered offensive, passes my comprehension. If nothing else had\r\n    occurred, one might think that it was only a piece of unnecessary\r\n    fuss on the part of Moustier, whose alternations of activity and\r\n    indolence are not always easy to follow; but looked at together with\r\n    the military preparations which have so much alarmed Colonel\r\n    Claremont and which you do not seem to contemplate without some\r\n    uneasiness, the state of things indicated is certainly not pleasant.\r\n    Perhaps I make too much of this: up to the present time I have\r\n    always contended against the alarmist view of the situation, and\r\n    Bernstorff,[13] whose information is generally good, shows no\r\n    anxiety. It is the business of war departments in all countries to\r\n    look at foreign policy from their special point of view, and I class\r\n    the utterances of General Moltke with those of Marshal Niel, as\r\n    professorial rather than political.\r\n\r\n    In any case I am not disposed to volunteer advice which would\r\n    certainly be uncalled for, probably useless, and perhaps altogether\r\n    out of place. Nor can I fail to detect in Moustier's language a\r\n    wish, hardly concealed, to enlist England on the side of the French\r\n    claim that Prussia shall not be enlarged--though it is disguised\r\n    under the form of asking us to give advice in the interests of\r\n    peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Lord Stanley was right, and that Moustier's\r\nintention was to commit England to the French side under the guise of a\r\nfriendly communication to the Prussian Government. The refusal to be\r\ndrawn into Franco-Prussian entanglement was sound, but, as will be seen,\r\nthe British Government did attempt to intervene shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn spite of highly coloured orations by Marshal Niel, and of an\r\nimportant speech by General Moltke on the position which Germany should\r\nhold as a predominant power in Europe, and of the use to be made of the\r\narmy and navy in consolidating German unity, which caused much\r\nirritation in France, the fear of the outbreak of war passed temporarily\r\naway, and calm again reigned in the diplomatic world. In August, Lord\r\nCowley, former ambassador at Paris, paid a visit to the Emperor Napoleon\r\nat Fontainebleau, and found him in a very depressed mood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Aug. 11, 1868.\r\n\r\n    Lord Cowley wrote me a short note after his return from\r\n    Fontainebleau and sent me an account of what had been said there.\r\n\r\n    He appears to have thought the Emperor aged, and to have found him\r\n    much depressed. His Majesty said little of Foreign Politics, but\r\n    spoke gloomily of his own position in France. He said that the\r\n    country districts were still for him, but that all the towns were\r\n    against him: a vast number of persons had congregated at Troyes to\r\n    see him, but he had been assured by the Prefect that most of them\r\n    were in reality red Republicans. The Emperor does not seem to have\r\n    said anything about the Queen. The Empress held the same language\r\n    that she and her entourage did to us, but from an expression she let\r\n    fall, it would seem that she is sore at heart about the visit. The\r\n    public appear to be rather accepting the version that it was in\r\n    compliance with a request from the Empress, that Her Majesty, being\r\n    ill and fatigued, abstained from returning the visit.\r\n\r\n    It is not certain whether the Emperor and Empress will be at\r\n    Biarritz or at St. Cloud at the time of Her Majesty's return. If\r\n    they are at Biarritz there can be no question of any visit, and this\r\n    might give an opportunity for a letter, which might smooth the\r\n    difficulties of the point of etiquette. If the Emperor and Empress\r\n    are at St. Cloud, it must be considered the same thing as if they\r\n    were at Paris.\r\n\r\n    I hear from other persons besides Lord Cowley that the Emperor is\r\n    very much out of spirits. It is even asserted that he is weary of\r\n    the whole thing, disappointed at the contrast between the brilliancy\r\n    at the beginning of his reign and the present gloom--and inclined,\r\n    if it were possible, to retire into private life. This is no doubt a\r\n    great exaggeration, but if he is really feeling unequal to governing\r\n    with energy, the dynasty and the country are in great danger.\r\n    Probably the wisest thing he could do, would be to allow real\r\n    parliamentary government to be established, so as to give the\r\n    opposition a hope of coming into office by less violent means than\r\n    a revolution.\r\n\r\nThe 'soreness of heart' referred to a visit of Queen Victoria, who had\r\npassed through Paris in July on her way to Switzerland. It had been\r\narranged, after prodigious correspondence, that the Empress should come\r\nup to the Elysée Palace and call upon the Queen at the Embassy (the\r\nElysée having been selected on account of its proximity), but apparently\r\nnothing was settled about a return visit on the part of the Queen. At\r\nall events, no return visit was paid to the Elysée, and the consequence\r\nwas that a section of the French press seized upon the occasion\r\nmaliciously to represent that the Emperor and Empress were no longer\r\ntreated with consideration by the ancient Royal Houses, and that England\r\nwas all in favour of the pretensions of the House of Orleans.\r\n\r\nThese attacks naturally caused much annoyance to the Emperor, who was\r\nalways very sensitive where the Orleans family was concerned, and he was\r\nplaced in a somewhat embarrassing position with regard to the return\r\njourney of Queen Victoria through Paris, since, owing to the visit of\r\nthe Empress not having been returned, he was unable to pay his respects\r\nas he had been anxious to do. The difficulty was eventually solved by\r\nthe Emperor and Empress arranging to go to Biarritz at the time when the\r\nQueen was expected to pass through Paris on the return journey, and an\r\nexplanatory letter from the latter was considered to have closed the\r\nmatter satisfactorily. If any trace of soreness remained it was\r\ndoubtless removed by the highly successful visit of the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Wales later in the year.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial spirits, which were much in need of a tonic, were\r\ntemporarily revived by the demonstrations of loyalty shown by the\r\nNational Guards at a review held in August, and this evidence of\r\npersonal popularity appears to have surprised most people. It may be\r\npresumed, however, that the unfortunate Emperor was frequently misled on\r\nthese occasions. Astonishment and admiration had frequently been evoked\r\nat the spectacle of the autocrat shaking hands freely with blouse-clad\r\nworking men and exchanging fraternal greetings with them on the occasion\r\nof public festivities, but, according to the Prefect of Police, these\r\nfavoured individuals were in every case his own detectives masquerading\r\nas horny-handed sons of toil.\r\n\r\nTwo questions of secondary importance about this period were brought to\r\nthe attention of the British Government, the one concerning Tunis, and\r\nthe other the Throne of Spain. In Tunis the French showed an\r\nunmistakable intention to establish themselves as the paramount power,\r\nand it was not clear whether England would remain indifferent or not.\r\nLord Stanley, upon being asked for instructions, gave it as his personal\r\nopinion that there was no occasion to show any jealousy of French\r\ninfluence there, and that the position of the French as near neighbours\r\ngave them a strong interest. He declined to believe in annexation, as\r\nAlgeria had not been such a success that any government would be likely\r\nto desire to extend the French dominions in North Africa. The French\r\nGovernment therefore obtained, as far as we were concerned, a free hand,\r\nand although Bismarck intimated that the claims of Prussia in Tunis\r\nwould have to be considered, it is probable that had it not been for the\r\nFranco-German War, that country would have become a French possession in\r\n1870 instead of in 1880.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Spain, it is worthy of note that the Spanish Government\r\nwas in 1868 desirous of offering the throne to the Duke of Edinburgh.\r\nBoth Queen Victoria and her ministers, however, were strongly opposed to\r\nthe project, and their opposition was founded on good sense. The throne,\r\nthey considered, was insecure. New dynasties took root with difficulty,\r\nmore especially in Spain, where respect for foreigners was not a\r\nnational characteristic, and it would be disagreeable for England to\r\nhave an English prince, however detached from England, involved in a\r\ncivil war, and possibly ejected. Again, even if the experiment were\r\nsuccessful, it would confer no real advantage on England, while it would\r\nprobably excite extreme jealousy in France. Further, we should probably\r\nbe asked to give up Gibraltar in return, and if this were refused, which\r\nof course would be the case, there would be a complaint, if not of\r\nabsolute unfairness, yet at least of ingratitude on our part. If any\r\nform of monarchy was to be retained, the opinion was expressed that the\r\ncause of religious freedom would be better served by a moderate Catholic\r\non the throne than by a Protestant.\r\n\r\nSuch were the matter-of-fact views of Her Majesty's Government as\r\nexpressed by Lord Stanley, and nothing more was heard of the proposed\r\ncandidature of the Duke of Edinburgh. The straightforward action of the\r\nBritish Government on this occasion contrasts favourably with that of\r\nother Powers when the question of the choice of a King of Spain recurred\r\ntwo years later.\r\n\r\nIn October, Lord Clarendon, who had been Lord Stanley's predecessor at\r\nthe Foreign Office, arrived in Paris. Lord Clarendon, in addition to a\r\nthorough acquaintance with foreign political questions, enjoyed\r\napparently the great advantage of being a _persona grata_ to all the\r\nprincipal personages in Europe, and was honoured with the confidence of\r\nNapoleon III., the King of Prussia, King Victor Emmanuel, the Pope, and\r\na host of other persons occupying high and responsible positions. As the\r\nLiberal party was at that time in opposition, he bore no responsibility,\r\nand it was therefore possible for him to use language and arguments\r\nwhich might not have been appropriate to any one speaking officially on\r\nbehalf of a government. The valuable and interesting information which\r\nLord Clarendon thus obtained was, in accordance with the high principles\r\nupon which he acted, placed unreservedly at the disposition of his\r\npolitical opponents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Oct. 13, 1868.\r\n\r\n    Lord Clarendon arrived here on Saturday. He has given me accounts of\r\n    interesting conversations he has had with the King and Queen of\r\n    Prussia and with General Moltke. The details he will no doubt repeat\r\n    to you when you see him. The sum of what was said by all three is\r\n    that Prussia earnestly desires to keep at peace with France; that\r\n    she will be very careful not to give offence and very slow to take\r\n    offence: that if a war is brought on she will act so as to make it\r\n    manifest to Germany and to Europe that France is the unprovoked\r\n    aggressor: that a war brought on evidently by France would infallibly\r\n    unite all Germany. Moltke seemed to believe that the Emperor\r\n    Napoleon must know too well how thoroughly prepared Prussia is to\r\n    provoke a war lightly. He was, on his side, well aware of the\r\n    complete state of preparation in which the French were: he thought\r\n    Prussia had lost an opportunity after Sadowa, and that if she had\r\n    then known that France could not bring more than 150,000 men into\r\n    the field, she might have settled the whole affair of German unity\r\n    out of hand. This opportunity had been lost, according to him, by\r\n    the incorrectness of the information from the Embassy at Paris, and\r\n    now Prussia must have peace if possible in order to organize her\r\n    system of government civil and military.\r\n\r\n    In short, Lord Clarendon is sure that the Emperor Napoleon may be\r\n    confident that he has nothing to fear from Prussia, if he does not\r\n    give her just provocation: but, on the other hand, that Prussia does\r\n    not fear a war, if she can show Germany and the world that she is\r\n    really forced into it.\r\n\r\n    I think I might very well mention to Moustier the impression Lord\r\n    Clarendon has brought back, and indeed to the Emperor, if I have an\r\n    opportunity.\r\n\r\n    Lord Clarendon gathered from Moltke and others that there is a very\r\n    strong feeling in the Prussian army against Russia and a very great\r\n    repugnance to accepting Russian assistance. In case however of a war\r\n    with France, Prussia must of course (Moltke observed) get help\r\n    wherever she could find it, and must at all events use Russia to\r\n    paralyze Austria. Austria he thought hostile, and very naturally so,\r\n    to Prussia, and ready to do all the harm she can. She is not\r\n    however, in his opinion, in a condition to be otherwise than neutral\r\n    at the beginning of a war.\r\n\r\n    Lord Clarendon tells me he most forcibly pointed out to the King of\r\n    Prussia and Moltke the extreme danger of giving France any\r\n    provocation; anything like a challenge could not be passed over by\r\n    the Emperor: if the glove were thrown down, public feeling would\r\n    oblige His Majesty to take it up. Lord Clarendon urged them to\r\n    settle the Danish question, and even suggested that some way should\r\n    be sought of giving a satisfaction to French _amour propre_.\r\n\r\n    It will be seen that the information obtained by Lord Clarendon\r\n    coincided more or less with the impressions derived by Prince\r\n    Napoleon. Upon Lord Stanley it produced a reassuring effect, and\r\n    confirmed him in his opinion that the Prussians were in a state of\r\n    alarm which they were endeavouring unsuccessfully to conceal, under\r\n    an ostentation of being ready for whatever might happen. In any\r\n    case, he thought, they would have a respite until the spring.\r\n\r\n    Lord Clarendon was fortunate enough to be able to give the Emperor\r\n    Napoleon the benefit of his Prussian experiences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Stanley._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Oct. 20, 1868.\r\n\r\n    Lord Clarendon dined at St. Cloud yesterday, and had a long\r\n    conversation with the Emperor after dinner. He repeated to His\r\n    Majesty the pacific language which he had heard from the King of\r\n    Prussia, the Queen of Prussia, and General Moltke. The Emperor heard\r\n    the pacific assurances with evident satisfaction, and spoke very\r\n    strongly himself in the same sense. Lord Clarendon was thoroughly\r\n    convinced that the Emperor was exceedingly anxious to avoid war and\r\n    thoroughly convinced that peace was desirable for the interests of\r\n    the dynasty. At the same time, His Majesty declared that if anything\r\n    like a challenge came from Prussia it would be impossible for him to\r\n    oppose the feeling of the army and the nation, and that he must, in\r\n    such a case, for the sake of his own safety, make war. He was most\r\n    anxious that England should step in to enable France and Prussia to\r\n    withdraw with honour from their present antagonistic attitude. This\r\n    is an idea which, as you know, has been vaguely suggested to me more\r\n    than once by men more or less in the Emperor's confidence. It has\r\n    never been hinted by Moustier in speaking to me. The Emperor\r\n    appears, however, to have dwelt a good deal upon it with Lord\r\n    Clarendon yesterday, and even to have entered a little upon details.\r\n    He seems to have relished the idea of other great powers being\r\n    united with England in a sort of mediation, but I did not gather\r\n    that he had any matured plan, or any distinct notion of the way in\r\n    which practical effect could be given to his wishes. His object was\r\n    to calm public opinion in France, and the means of doing this were\r\n    to be a sort of collective confirmation by Europe of the Treaty of\r\n    Prague, and a sort of pressure to be exercised by Europe on France\r\n    and Prussia which would compel them, or rather enable them, to\r\n    diminish their military preparations and take effectual steps to\r\n    restore public confidence. Whatever may be the feasibility of the\r\n    Emperor's project, it is important to know what is in his mind, and\r\n    convenient to learn it with so much certainty, and at the same time\r\n    in a way which prevents its being presented to H.M. Government as a\r\n    proposal or a suggestion to them. There is nothing as the matter\r\n    stands which necessitates even an expression of opinion from us.\r\n\r\n    The Emperor told Clarendon in strict confidence of a proposal which\r\n    he had not, he said, mentioned even to his Ministers. Men of weight\r\n    (_des hommes sérieux_) had proposed a Confederation between the\r\n    South German States and Switzerland. Lord Clarendon pointed out\r\n    objections to the notion, such as the want of any real bond of\r\n    sympathy or interest between Switzerland and the proposed\r\n    confederates, and the offence which would be taken by Prussia, and\r\n    the Emperor appeared (for the moment, at least) to have given up the\r\n    idea.\r\n\r\n    The King of Prussia told Lord Clarendon, and Lord Clarendon repeated\r\n    it to the Emperor, that the speech at Kiel was intended to be\r\n    thoroughly pacific, and that its object was to make the Prussian\r\n    army and the public take quietly the anti-Prussian cries stated to\r\n    have been uttered by the French troops at the camp at Chalons. The\r\n    Emperor positively declared that no anti-Prussian cries and no\r\n    political cries of any kind beyond the usual loyal cheers had been\r\n    uttered at the camp.\r\n\r\n    Of Spanish affairs little seems to have been said in the\r\n    conversation with the Emperor. At dinner the Empress talked of\r\n    little else. She did not appear to favour any particular solution of\r\n    the question or any particular candidate for the Crown. She appeared\r\n    to expect both political troubles and extreme misery from the famine\r\n    which she says is undoubtedly impending. As to her own estates and\r\n    those of her relations in Spain she says they return absolutely\r\n    nothing, and that the peasants have not even put by grain enough to\r\n    sow the land. No one dares to store up grain or to bring it from\r\n    abroad lest he should be torn to pieces by the ignorant people as an\r\n    _accapareur_.\r\n\r\nFrom this interesting communication it will be noted that Napoleon III.\r\napparently reposed more confidence in Lord Clarendon than in his own\r\nministers; the '_hommes sérieux_' were, however, probably mythical, as\r\nthe proposed Confederation of Switzerland and the Southern German States\r\nwas not a project which would commend itself to practical people, and is\r\nmore likely to have been conceived in his own nebulous imagination. The\r\nimportant conclusion to be drawn from his language is that the Emperor\r\nwas, at all events, at that period, sincerely anxious to avoid war,\r\nconscious of the military power of Prussia, and extremely anxious to\r\ninduce the British Government to take some step in the nature of\r\nmediation which should avert the threatened conflict and enable France\r\nto withdraw with honour. This suggestion had already been ineffectually\r\nmade to Lord Stanley in the spring; but, as will be seen, a similar\r\nsuggestion was again put forward in the following year and acted upon.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of 1868 changes took place both in the British and in\r\nthe French Foreign Offices. The return of the Liberal party to power\r\nrestored Lord Clarendon to his old post, and M. de Moustier gave\r\nplace to M. de La Valette. The departure of Moustier was no loss. At\r\nConstantinople he had shown himself to be restless and overbearing; in\r\nFrance he was not considered to be entirely satisfactory where\r\nsemi-financial matters were concerned, and he finished his career by\r\nnearly getting into a serious scrape with the Prussian Government over\r\nthe question of the latter being represented on a proposed Commission at\r\nTunis. The Emperor Napoleon, although he entertained no grievance\r\nagainst Lord Stanley, naturally welcomed the return to office of Lord\r\nClarendon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 15, 1868.\r\n\r\n    I came back from Compiègne yesterday. During the week I was there\r\n    the Emperor seemed to be in remarkably good health and spirits, and\r\n    was to all appearance very free from care. If he has any special\r\n    plan regarding foreign politics, he is keeping it _in petto_ to\r\n    electrify the Corps Diplomatique on New Year's Day, or the Chambers\r\n    in his opening speech. He talked a great deal to me of his desire to\r\n    maintain his cordial understanding with England and of his\r\n    confidence in your helping him to do so, but he did not speak as if\r\n    he had any intention of putting our friendship to any special test\r\n    at present.\r\n\r\n    He said that the conduct of the Greeks was very annoying, but that\r\n    in dealing with them, we must make some allowance for their feeling\r\n    of nationality and not _froisser_ it too much. I observed to him\r\n    that the Greeks, by their conduct with regard to Crete, were\r\n    producing a state of things which would be absolutely intolerable,\r\n    and that they were in my opinion doing themselves much more harm\r\n    than they did the Turks. In this he seemed to concur. My Russian\r\n    colleague, Stackelberg, was in a dreadful fuss about the Turco-Greek\r\n    question. The main anxiety he expressed was, not unnaturally, for\r\n    the King and the dynasty. We might perhaps work upon Russia by\r\n    showing that the dynasty would be continually popular if Greek\r\n    aggressions, and consequently excitement and disorder in Greece, are\r\n    allowed to become chronic.\r\n\r\n    The Emperor talked a little and the Empress a great deal about\r\n    Spain; both took a gloomy view of the prospects, but neither gave\r\n    any hint of the solution to be desired.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince of Prussia, whose peaceful proclivities became\r\nsubsequently known to the world, happened to be in England at this\r\ntime, and Lord Clarendon took the opportunity of discussing the\r\nFranco-Prussian situation with him. The Crown Prince had already\r\nimpressed Lord Stanley with his amiability, modesty, and good sense, but\r\nit is evident that, like many others, he had not fully realized the\r\ngreat sacrifices which the Germans were ready to make in the cause of\r\nnational unity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyon._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, Dec. 18, 1868.\r\n\r\n    My inchoate letter on the 16th was cut short by the Crown Prince of\r\n    Prussia, with whom I had an interesting conversation. He is even\r\n    more pacific than his Father, and unlike his Father would be glad to\r\n    put the army on something more like a peace footing. The King\r\n    however is unapproachable on this subject, but the Prince says that\r\n    in a year or two he will have to yield to the outcry of the people\r\n    against the increased taxation that such monster armaments entail.\r\n    He means to consult some experienced officers as to the manner in\r\n    which reduction can be made without offence to the dignity of his\r\n    martial Sire, and he said that something had been done in that\r\n    direction by postponing till January the assembling of the levies\r\n    that ought to have taken place in October. I urged strongly upon him\r\n    the necessity of maintaining the _status quo_, and particularly\r\n    warned him against the incorporation of the Grand Duchy of Baden\r\n    into the Northern Confederation. He quite entered into the reasons\r\n    for this and said it would probably be a long time before the\r\n    interests of the South would necessitate a junction with the North,\r\n    although it would ultimately be inevitable.\r\n\r\n    When I last saw you on my way home from St. Cloud I told you that\r\n    the Emperor wished me to report my conversation with him to the\r\n    Queen of Prussia--I did so. She forwarded my letter to the King and\r\n    sent me his answer, which was not only pacific but extremely\r\n    courteous to the Emperor. He said there was no fear of the _status\r\n    quo_ being changed now, but that some time or other the South and\r\n    North must be united, and that it would be far better to _calmer les\r\n    esprits_ by teaching people to expect it and not to look upon it as\r\n    a danger or a menace to France, which it would not be any more than\r\n    the existing state of things. I wrote all this to the Emperor who\r\n    assured me that the King of Prussia's opinions had interested him\r\n    much and that he agreed in his views about the inexpediency of a\r\n    Congress.--Disraeli made a bad use at the Lord Mayor's dinner of\r\n    your letter giving an account of my interview with the Emperor, for\r\n    he gave it to be understood that Stanley was successfully mediating\r\n    between France and Prussia, etc; La Tour d'Auvergne, to whom the\r\n    Emperor had told our conversation, was much annoyed and feared that\r\n    he might be thought guilty of an indiscretion.\r\n\r\n    I was glad to learn by your letter of the 15th that you thought well\r\n    of the Emperor's health, as reports have of late been rife that he\r\n    was failing both in body and mind--their object was probably, and as\r\n    usual, some Bourse speculation.\r\n\r\nThe chronic anxiety with regard to the relations between France and\r\nPrussia which prevailed at this time was partially forgotten early in\r\n1869 in consequence of a slight crisis in the East. The Cretan\r\nInsurrection had lasted for several years, and the Turks had shown\r\nthemselves incapable of suppressing it in consequence of the attitude\r\nof the Greek Government, which, supported by Russia, openly encouraged\r\nthe revolutionary movement. Greek armed cruisers ran the blockade,\r\nvolunteers openly showed themselves in uniform in the Greek towns, and\r\nthe Greeks showed a disposition to go to war, rightly assuming that\r\nEurope would never allow their country to be reconquered. At length the\r\nsituation, from the Turkish point of view, became intolerable, and in\r\nDecember, 1868, the Turkish Government delivered an ultimatum, which was\r\nrejected by the Greeks and diplomatic relations were broken off. The\r\nopportunity was at once seized by the Emperor Napoleon in order to\r\npropose a Conference. Conferences had, as is well known, a special\r\nattraction for Napoleon III., who delighted to figure as a magnificent\r\nand beneficent arbiter graciously condescending to settle the squabbles\r\nof inferior beings, but a Conference has also often captivated the\r\nimagination of many diplomatists besides the late Prince Gortchakoff,\r\nwhose chief delight it was to make orations to his colleagues. Nothing\r\nproduces so agreeable a flutter in diplomacy as the prospect of a\r\nConference. Where shall it be held? What is to be its basis? Who are to\r\nbe the representatives? What Governments shall be entitled to appear? If\r\nsuch a one is invited, will it be possible to exclude another? And\r\nsupposing these knotty points to be satisfactorily settled, shall some\r\nPower possessing doubtful credentials be allowed a _voix consultative_,\r\nor a _voix délibérative_? In this particular case, there was no\r\ndifficulty in fixing upon the place, but there was considerable\r\ndifficulty with regard to the participation of Greece, as Turkey flatly\r\nrefused to meet her. The prospect of a Conference was not viewed with\r\nmuch satisfaction by Lord Clarendon, who asked awkward but necessary\r\nquestions about 'basis' and so forth, and warned Lord Lyons that he\r\nwould have to be very firm with La Valette on this point, 'as I know by\r\nexperience in 1856 how fickle the Emperor is, and how invariably his\r\nminister changes with him, and throws over the engagements upon which we\r\nhad the best reason to rely.'\r\n\r\nNeither did Lord Lyons look forward to it with any pleasure: 'The\r\nConference seems likely to bring into strong light some things which\r\nwould perhaps be better in the shade,' he wrote. 'For instance, an\r\nunderstanding between Russia and Prussia on the Eastern Question;\r\nbitterness between Austria and Russia, etc., etc. I understand that\r\nthere is great rejoicing over the prospect of the Conference at the\r\nTuileries.' Probably Lord Lyons's distaste arose partly from the fact\r\nthat foreign diplomatists have a habit of coming and rehearsing to their\r\ncolleagues the speeches with which they propose subsequently to\r\nelectrify the assembled Conference. It is only fair to admit, however,\r\nthat the Conference was brought to a fairly satisfactory conclusion. The\r\nGreeks, who had given a great deal of trouble with their consequential\r\npretensions, were admitted under a _voix consultative_ condition, and a\r\nsettlement was arrived at which enabled diplomatic relations to be\r\nresumed with Turkey. To put it shortly, the Greeks were informed that\r\nthey were bound to respect the rules common to all Governments in their\r\nfuture dealing with the Ottoman Empire (surely not a very onerous\r\nprovision), and the hope was expressed that all the causes for complaint\r\nembodied in the ultimatum of the Porte would be removed. Crete, in\r\nconsequence, remained comparatively quiet for about ten years.\r\nWhen, however, a few days after the satisfactory conclusion of this\r\nbusiness, the Prussian Government came forward with a proposal that\r\nthere should be yet another Conference at Paris on International\r\nPostage, M. de La Valette was obliged summarily to reject it, as\r\n'the French public was sick to death of the very word.'\r\n\r\nEarly in 1869, considerable apprehension was created by the Luxemburg\r\nrailway affair. A French and a Belgian railway company whose lines\r\nadjoined, had endeavoured to bring about an amalgamation, and the\r\nBelgian Chamber, naturally afraid of the consequences which might result\r\nfrom French influences within Belgian territory, passed an Act\r\nprohibiting concessions of railways without the authorization of the\r\nGovernment. This action caused considerable ill-feeling in France, and a\r\nuniversal belief existed that the Belgian Government had been instigated\r\nby Bismarck. It was obvious that England could not remain indifferent to\r\nthe danger of what would now be called the 'peaceful penetration' of\r\nFrance into Belgium,--in other words, the ultimate annexation of that\r\ncountry--and one of the first notes of alarm seems to have been sounded\r\nby no less a person than Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _General Grey to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Osborne, Jan. 14, 1869.\r\n\r\n    The Queen desired me to write to you yesterday in returning the\r\n    private letters you sent her with reference to what you said in one\r\n    of your letters of the probable designs of France in Belgium. Her\r\n    Majesty wished me to inform you that she had more than once called\r\n    the attention of the late Government to this subject. The King of\r\n    the Belgians in writing to her had repeatedly expressed his\r\n    apprehensions that either by means of a Customs convention or by the\r\n    purchase by a French company of the Luxemburg Railway to which\r\n    unusual privileges and advantages would be conceded by the French\r\n    Government, France might seek to obtain a footing in Belgium highly\r\n    dangerous to her future independence and neutrality. Her Majesty,\r\n    though hoping the King might exaggerate the danger, has invariably\r\n    expressed the strongest opinion that England was bound, not only by\r\n    the obligations of treaties, but by interests of vital importance to\r\n    herself, to maintain the integrity and independence as well as the\r\n    neutrality of Belgium; and that the best security for these\r\n    essential objects would be found in the knowledge that any\r\n    proceedings which seemed to threaten their violation would bring\r\n    England at once into the field.\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty did not mean that any official communication should be\r\n    made on the subject, but that the habitual language of our ministers\r\n    at Berlin and Paris should be such as to leave no doubt as to the\r\n    determination of England.\r\n\r\nThis communication from the Queen was followed not long afterwards by a\r\nmemorandum from Mr. Gladstone, laying stress upon the fact that the\r\n'independence of Belgium was an object of the first interest to the mind\r\nof the British People,' and hoping that it would be made clear to the\r\nFrench Government 'that the suspicion even of an intention on the part\r\nof France to pay less respect to the independence of Belgium than to the\r\nindependence of England would at once produce a temper in the country\r\nwhich would put an end to the good understanding and useful and\r\nharmonious co-operation of the two Governments.' This was very clear\r\nlanguage--especially for Mr. Gladstone--and the Ambassador was directed\r\nto hint to the French Government that Belgium was under our special\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 16, 1869.\r\n\r\n    Baron Beyens, the Belgian Minister, comes to me frequently about the\r\n    Grand Luxemburg Railway affair, and is very naturally in great\r\n    tribulation both for himself and his country.\r\n\r\n    M. de La Valette also loses no opportunity of speaking to me about\r\n    it, and appears also to be very much disturbed. For my own part, I\r\n    can only preach in general terms conciliation to both.\r\n\r\n    I have found M. de La Valette calm and moderate, but I am afraid\r\n    there can be no doubt that the affair is extremely annoying to the\r\n    Emperor, and that His Majesty is very angry. M. de La Valette asked\r\n    me to call upon him to-day, and told me in the strictest confidence,\r\n    though he did not pretend to have absolute proof of it, that the\r\n    whole thing was instigated by Count Bismarck. He considered that\r\n    there were three possible solutions of the question.\r\n\r\n    The first, that France should at her own risk and peril annex\r\n    Belgium to herself. To this solution M. de La Valette was himself\r\n    utterly opposed.\r\n\r\n    The second was the adoption of retaliatory financial and commercial\r\n    measures. To this he was also opposed, considering it to be\r\n    undignified, to be injurious to the interests of Frenchmen, and to\r\n    constitute a punishment for all Belgians innocent as well as guilty.\r\n\r\n    The third course was to pursue the line already taken. To admit\r\n    fully the right of the Belgian Government to act as it had done, but\r\n    to declare in very distinct terms that it had been guilty of a very\r\n    _mauvais procédé_ towards France, and that the Government of the\r\n    Emperor was deeply wounded and very seriously displeased. He said\r\n    that he was about to prepare a despatch in the above sense.\r\n\r\n    I need not say that I did all in my power to strengthen his aversion\r\n    to the two first courses, and to induce him to soften the tone of\r\n    his communication to Belgium.\r\n\r\n    He seemed however to be afraid that the Emperor would be hardly\r\n    satisfied with so little, and he declared it to be quite impossible\r\n    that any friendship could hereafter exist between the French\r\n    Government and the present Belgian Ministry. In fact, he was far\r\n    from sure that his policy would be adopted.\r\n\r\n    He talks of Bismarck and his ways in a tone which is not\r\n    comfortable, and the irritation in France against Prussia seems to\r\n    increase rather than diminish. Certainly confidence in peace has not\r\n    increased lately.\r\n\r\nM. de La Valette may have been calm and moderate, but his Imperial\r\nMaster was very much the reverse, and his conduct of the affair was a\r\nstriking instance of his ineptitude. He had thoroughly frightened the\r\nBelgians, alienated public opinion in England, and aroused well-founded\r\nsuspicions throughout Europe that he intended to fasten a quarrel upon\r\nBelgium in order to facilitate its eventual annexation. According to\r\nLord Clarendon, the idea that Bismarck had prompted Belgian action was a\r\ncomplete mare's nest, but even if that were not so, it ought to have\r\nbeen plain to the Emperor that if there was one thing more than another\r\nwhich would gladden Prussia, it was a misunderstanding between France\r\nand England. The feeling in England at the time may be judged by\r\nGladstone's language, who wrote to Lord Clarendon in March 12--\r\n\r\n    'That the day when this nation seriously suspects France of meaning\r\n    ill to Belgian independence will be the last day of friendship with\r\n    that country, and that then a future will open for which no man can\r\n    answer.'\r\n\r\nThis apparently was what the Emperor was unable to see.\r\n\r\n    'Bismarck is biding his time quietly,' wrote Lord Clarendon. 'If\r\n    France annexes Belgium and we take no part he will be delighted, as\r\n    France could no longer complain of Prussian aggrandisement. If we do\r\n    take part, he would be equally delighted at the rupture between\r\n    England and France, and would come to our assistance. Either way he\r\n    thinks Prussia would gain. Why should Napoleon and La Valette assist\r\n    him? A quarrel between France and England or even a coolness is the\r\n    great German desideratum.' 'I believe,' he adds in another letter,\r\n    'nothing would be more agreeable to Prussia than that the intimacy\r\n    between the two countries should be disturbed by a territorial\r\n    encroachment which would run on all fours with Prussian\r\n    aggrandisement.'\r\n\r\nFor some reason, which was not clear, the Emperor persisted in making\r\nthe question a personal one, announcing that he 'could not and would not\r\ntake a _soufflet_ from Belgium,' and the British Government became so\r\napprehensive of his attitude that the somewhat unheroic course was\r\nadopted of sending a warning to the French Government, but leaving the\r\nresponsibility of presenting, or of withholding it, to the Ambassador.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, March 16, 1869.\r\n\r\n    We are very anxious about the Belgian business because more or less\r\n    convinced that the Emperor is meaning mischief and intending to\r\n    establish unfriendly relations with Belgium preparatory to ulterior\r\n    designs. It is very imprudent on his part, and he will only reap\r\n    disappointment, for even if he meditates war with Prussia he could\r\n    not undertake it upon a worse pretext or one less likely to win\r\n    public opinion to his side, as it would wantonly entail an\r\n    interruption, to use a mild term, of friendly relations with\r\n    England. It is unnecessary to say that we attach extreme importance\r\n    to the maintenance unimpaired of those relations, and it is\r\n    therefore our paramount duty to omit no effort for that object.\r\n\r\n    I have accordingly, by the unanimous desire of the Cabinet, written\r\n    you a despatch calling the serious attention of the French Government\r\n    to the dangerous eventualities that we see looming in the distance,\r\n    but the mode of dealing with that despatch may be delicate and\r\n    difficult, and we therefore leave the decision on that point to your\r\n    discretion. You can either read it, or tell the substance of it at\r\n    once to La Valette, or you may keep it for a short time until some\r\n    crisis arrives when it could best be turned to account. I feel that\r\n    this is rather hard upon you, and I would much rather have been more\r\n    precise, but, on the spot, you will be such a much better judge of\r\n    opportunity than I can pretend to be here, and if the warning is to\r\n    have any success it will depend on its being given at the right\r\n    moment and in the right manner.'\r\n\r\nOne cannot help wondering whether a similar confidence in an\r\nAmbassador's judgment is still shown at the present day, the views of\r\nthe so-called 'man on the spot' being now generally at a considerable\r\ndiscount. In this case, Lord Lyons gave reasons showing that the warning\r\nwas not needed, and would not be of any advantage to Belgium, while\r\ncomplaining that he disliked going about with a live shell in his\r\npocket. A few days later, however, Lord Clarendon wrote again saying\r\nthat he thought that the warning would have to be addressed shortly, as\r\npublic opinion in England was beginning to become excited, and attacks\r\nwere being made upon the Government for not using stronger language or\r\nshowing its determination to stand by Belgium, while the King of the\r\nBelgians was anxious to make his woes known through the English press.\r\n'If,' said Lord Clarendon, 'the Emperor attaches value to the English\r\nAlliance he ought not to sacrifice it by a sneaking attempt to\r\nincorporate Belgium by means of a railway company and its employés. If\r\nhe wants war it is a bad pretext for doing that which all mankind will\r\nblame him for.'\r\n\r\nIt was not unnatural that Lord Clarendon should have felt uneasy at the\r\nthreatening development of this apparently insignificant railway\r\ndifficulty, because it was plain that the one object which the Belgians\r\nwere bent upon was to entangle us in their concerns, and to make us\r\nresponsible for their conduct towards France; nor, again, was this an\r\nunreasonable proceeding upon their part, for Belgium was an artificial\r\nstate, and as dependent upon foreign guarantees for her existence as\r\nHolland was dependent upon her dykes. Perhaps in order to reassure the\r\nBritish Government, Marshal Niel's aide-de-camp and General Fleury were\r\nsent over to London in April. They brought a message from the Marshal to\r\nthe effect that France was ready for anything, and that the Emperor had\r\nonly to give the word; but that to begin by a rupture with England about\r\na miserable Belgian difference would be a _sottise_. These visitors did\r\nmore to convince the French Ambassador in London that there was no\r\ndanger of war than all his correspondence with the French Foreign\r\nOffice, but Lord Clarendon continued to be apprehensive of the influence\r\nexcited upon the Emperor by shady financiers and by an untrustworthy\r\nrepresentative at Brussels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, April 19, 1869.\r\n\r\n    I have never, as you know, felt any confidence in the soft sayings\r\n    and assurances of the French Government, but I did not think they\r\n    would have exposed the cloven foot so soon and completely as they\r\n    have done. No affair has given me so much pain since my return\r\n    to this place, and I foresee that out of it will grow serious\r\n    complications and an end to those friendly relations between England\r\n    and France that are so advantageous to both countries and which have\r\n    had an important influence on the politics of Europe.\r\n\r\n    What provokes me is that _sales tripotages_ should be at the bottom\r\n    of it all, and upon that I have reliable information. I know of all\r\n    the jobbery and _pots de vin_ that are passing, and yet it is to\r\n    fill the pockets of half a dozen rascals, just as in the case of\r\n    Mexico, that the Emperor allows himself to be dragged through the\r\n    mud and to imperil the most manifest interests of France.\r\n\r\n    The policy of the French Government is perfectly understood at\r\n    Berlin, where the leading object of Bismarck is to detach us from\r\n    France. We might to-morrow, if we pleased, enter into a coalition\r\n    with Prussia against France for the protection of Belgian\r\n    independence, which is a European and not an exclusively French\r\n    question; but we will do nothing of the kind so long as there is a\r\n    hope that France will act with common honesty. I wish you would\r\n    speak seriously to La Valette about the _tripoteurs_, and represent\r\n    the disgrace to his Government of playing the game of such people,\r\n    which will all come out and be known in the same way as the Jecker\r\n    bonds are now unanimously acknowledged to have been the cause of\r\n    that fatal Mexican expedition.\r\n\r\n    I send you rather a curious despatch from Loftus. Bismarck's ways\r\n    are inscrutable, and he is never to be relied upon, but he has had a\r\n    union with us against France in his head ever since the Belgian\r\n    business began, for Bernstorff, who never speaks without\r\n    instructions, has said on more than one occasion to Gladstone and to\r\n    me that though Prussia would not undertake to defend Belgium\r\n    single-handed, as that country concerned England more nearly than\r\n    Prussia, yet that we had but to say the word, and we should soon\r\n    come to terms. I treated this, as did Gladstone, rather as a _façon\r\n    de parler_ and a ruse to detach us from France, which is Bismarck's\r\n    main object, as I did not choose that Bernstorff should have to\r\n    report the slightest encouragement to the suggestion, but it _may_\r\n    come to that after all.\r\n\r\nColonel Walker, the British military attaché at Berlin, whom Lord\r\nClarendon considered to be one of the most enlightened and intelligent\r\nmen of his profession, was in London at the time, and he reported that\r\nthere was not the slightest sign of any active military preparation in\r\nany part of Prussia, and that the idea of war was so much discouraged by\r\nthe military authorities that it was no longer talked of in military\r\ncircles, whereas formerly it had been the only topic of discussion. The\r\nmanoeuvres were to be held in the Prussian provinces most remote from\r\nFrance, and there was a fixed determination to give the latter no cause\r\nfor offence, not from fear of that country, for there was a conviction\r\nthat Prussia would have the best of a war, but owing to internal\r\ndifficulties. Colonel Walker added that the mutual indisposition of the\r\nNorth and South to each other was becoming so manifest that the\r\nunification of Germany was far distant.\r\n\r\nThis comforting piece of intelligence Lord Lyons was instructed to\r\ncommunicate to the French Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\nThe Luxemburg Railway difficulty was finally disposed of by a Commission\r\nat London, but before this took place, the Belgian Liberal Minister, M.\r\nFrère-Orban, found it necessary to pay a visit to Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, April 28, 1869.\r\n\r\n    Frère-Orban had a farewell audience of the Emperor this morning. He\r\n    tells me that his Majesty was very gracious. Frère appears to have\r\n    insinuated that the business was finished. The Emperor expressed a\r\n    hope that something good would be done in the Commission. The\r\n    Emperor dwelt upon the necessity of France and Belgium being upon\r\n    the best terms in order to put a stop to all the ideas of annexation\r\n    which certain journals were continually putting forward. His Majesty\r\n    said that the annexation of Belgium to France would be disagreeable\r\n    to England, which would of itself be a reason sufficient to make him\r\n    averse from it. His Majesty had on his table the Arcolay pamphlet\r\n    which asserts that Prussia would be unable to defend South Germany\r\n    against France. He said that in an answer to this pamphlet published\r\n    at Berlin, the Belgian army was counted among the forces to act\r\n    against France, and observed that France and Belgium ought to be on\r\n    too good terms to render such an employment of the Belgian army\r\n    possible. Frère said that His Majesty had only to make Belgium feel\r\n    convinced that her independence was safe, in order to ensure her\r\n    sympathy with France. Frère appears to have been much pleased with\r\n    the audience on the whole, though he would rather the Emperor had\r\n    said distinctly that he did not expect any result from the\r\n    Commission, and looked upon the whole question as at an end. He is\r\n    very well satisfied with the result of his mission to Paris, as he\r\n    has placed the relations on a friendly footing, and conceded\r\n    absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\n    The great points now are for the Belgians not to sing songs of\r\n    triumph, and for us and everybody to avoid all appearance of having\r\n    exercised any pressure. The Emperor cannot safely take a snub from\r\n    any foreign nation, and he feels this very strongly.\r\n\r\nIt is to the Emperor's credit that, in spite of disastrous failures, he\r\nalways seems to have preserved a courteous and amiable demeanour. In\r\nthis particular case, it is probable that he did not know clearly what\r\nhe wanted himself, and that, misled by unscrupulous advisers, he\r\nentertained vague notions as to the possibility of annexing Belgium, and\r\nthen withdrawing, as best he could, when the difficulties were realized.\r\nAt all events, the sole result was a rebuff and an increased want of\r\nconfidence in his integrity. In short, the mismanagement of this railway\r\naffair, which should never have been allowed to attain so much\r\nimportance, and the collapse of his previous attempt upon Belgium,\r\njustified the sneer levelled at him by Bismarck, who, as recorded by\r\nBusch, remarked in 1870, 'He (Napoleon III.) should have occupied----and\r\nheld it as a pledge. But he is, and remains a muddle-headed fellow.' A\r\nstill more scathing definition was applied to him by his distinguished\r\ncountryman, M. Thiers--_une immense incapacité méconnue_.\r\n\r\nThe private correspondence in 1869 with Lord Clarendon, who was by far\r\nthe most voluminous letter-writer amongst English Foreign Secretaries,\r\ncontains references to many topics besides the relations between France\r\nand Prussia, such as Tunis, the Eastern Question, Spain, the internal\r\nsituation in France, the inauguration of a new Prussian seaport, the\r\nSuez Canal, and a host of other subjects. Amongst these may be mentioned\r\ntwo projected visits of exalted personages. The Khedive Ismail was\r\nexpected in England, and there was some uncertainty as to how he should\r\nbe treated. In the previous year he had ingratiated himself with the\r\nSultan of Turkey by agreeing to pay an increased tribute, and as a\r\nconsideration had obtained the title of Khedive and the privilege of\r\nsecuring the Viceroyalty of Egypt for his own family. Being of a vain\r\nand ostentatious disposition, however, he had now fallen into disfavour\r\nwith his Suzerain by reason of the royal airs which he assumed and of\r\nactions which seemed to imply that he considered himself to be an\r\nindependent ruler. 'Pray let me know,' wrote Lord Clarendon, 'how the\r\nViceroy is received at Paris. The Turkish Ambassador has been boring me\r\nwith protestations against the royal receptions already given to him and\r\nwhich he fears may be repeated here. He yesterday showed me a telegram\r\nfrom Constantinople, saying that _l'effet serait fort regrettable_ if\r\nthe Viceroy was lodged in the same apartment at Buckingham Palace that\r\nthe Sultan occupied. He declares that this voyage through Europe is to\r\ndispose Governments favourably to recognize his independence, and that\r\nhe will be backed by France against his suzerain.'\r\n\r\nUpon making inquiries at Paris it was found that the same question had\r\nbeen raised there, the Turkish Ambassador having made a remonstrance\r\nagainst the Khedive being lodged in the Elysée, and a special request\r\nthat at least the room in which the Sultan slept should not be\r\ndesecrated by his obnoxious vassal. The French Foreign Minister had\r\nthereupon advised the Ambassador to consider the remonstrance about the\r\nElysée and the bedroom as _non avenue_, as it could only serve to make\r\nthe Ambassador and his Government look ridiculous. Nevertheless, M. de\r\nLa Valette admitted that the Viceroy was taking too independent a line,\r\nand that the proposal to neutralize the Suez Canal was an Imperial\r\nquestion which should originate from the Porte, and not from the\r\nEgyptian ruler.\r\n\r\nThe other and more illustrious traveller was the Empress Eugénie, who\r\nwas desirous of attending the inauguration of the Suez Canal, and who\r\nunexpectedly intimated that she wished to make a tour in India. Upon\r\nthis becoming known, Queen Victoria caused her to be informed that her\r\npresence in any part of the British dominions would always be most\r\nwelcome, and that every arrangement would be made for her comfort and\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\n    'The Empress talked to me last night,' wrote Lord Lyons, 'for a very\r\n    long time and with great animation, not to say enthusiasm, of her\r\n    project of going to India. She gives herself two months away from\r\n    France, during which she proposes to go to Ceylon and most of the\r\n    principal places in India except Calcutta. She repeated her thanks\r\n    to the Queen and to you, and said that as the Queen had never been\r\n    herself to India, she herself, as a Foreign Sovereign, could not\r\n    think of receiving Royal Honours, and besides, that she particularly\r\n    wished for her own sake to observe the incognito and to be allowed\r\n    to go about and see things in the quickest and most unostentatious\r\n    manner. I told her that she had only to let us know exactly what her\r\n    wishes were and every effort should be made to carry them out. She\r\n    particularly begged that her idea of going to India might not be\r\n    talked about, lest it should be discussed and criticized in the\r\n    papers. I cannot suppose she will ever really go to India, but she\r\n    is full of it now. La Valette will stop it if he can, for his own\r\n    sake; for he depends a good deal upon her support at the Palace.'\r\n\r\nThis journey, of course, never took place. La Valette prevented it by\r\nrepresenting to the Empress that if she went to Suez she must also go to\r\nConstantinople, and thus sufficient time for a tour in India was not\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nA trivial incident in French high society which occurred about this time\r\nserves to show with what extraordinary facility the most exaggerated\r\nstatements can be circulated and credited. Writing to Lord Lyons, Lord\r\nClarendon stated that he had been informed that the former had been\r\nplaced in a most disagreeable position at a party given by Princess\r\nMathilde, at which a recitation had been delivered marked by the most\r\nfurious abuse of the English, and that the Emperor had gone up to the\r\nreciting lady and ostentatiously complimented her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 9, 1869.\r\n\r\n    The only foundation for the story you mention is the fact that I was\r\n    at a party at the Princesse Mathilde's at which a play was acted and\r\n    some verses recited. The room however was so small that only the\r\n    Emperor and Empress and some of the principal ladies had seats in\r\n    it. The rest of the company were dispersed in other rooms. For my\r\n    own part I was two rooms off, entirely out of sight and out of\r\n    hearing of the performance and recitation. Among the verses was, I\r\n    believe, an old ode of Victor Hugo's in praise of the First Emperor.\r\n    I have never read it, but I dare say it is not over-complimentary to\r\n    England. I hear the Emperor was affected to tears by it, but it\r\n    certainly neither placed me in an awkward situation, nor gave me any\r\n    emotion, for it was out of sight and hearing, and I did not know it\r\n    had been recited.\r\n\r\nIn June Lord Lyons received his first request to take part in a division\r\nin the House of Lords. As far as is known, he had never made any\r\ndeclaration as to his political views, but apparently he figured on the\r\nWhip's list as a Liberal or Whig, and Lord Clarendon wrote saying that\r\nthe Conservative Lords had determined upon the suicidal course of\r\nthrowing out the Irish Church Bill, and that as the House of Commons was\r\n'capable of anything' it was imperative to prevent such a disaster; that\r\nevery vote in the Lords was of value, and that if he had no serious\r\nobjection it was desirable that he should come over and vote on the\r\nsecond Reading. The answer to this appeal strikes one as a model of\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 6, 1869.\r\n\r\n    I am very much obliged by your kind consideration in not _pressing_\r\n    me on the subject of coming over to vote on the Irish Church Bill.\r\n    I will frankly say that I have a very strong disinclination to do\r\n    so. The professional objections are too obvious to mention, and I\r\n    have another feeling which would make me hesitate. I have as yet\r\n    never taken any part whatever in home politics. If I ever come to\r\n    live in England, I shall of course endeavour to take a political\r\n    line and to be of any use I can. In the meantime I should have great\r\n    difficulty in reconciling myself to the idea of now and then giving\r\n    a sort of blind vote, either for the sake of party, or from\r\n    deference to friends however much I might value and esteem them.\r\n\r\nIn other words, he knew scarcely anything about the merits or demerits\r\nof the Bill which he was expected to support, and was, of all men, the\r\nleast inclined to give a vote on a question with which he was\r\nunacquainted. Lord Clarendon, however, doubtless much against his\r\ninclination, was compelled to return to the charge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    June 12, 1869.\r\n\r\n    I am writing in the Cabinet room, and by the unanimous desire of my\r\n    colleagues, to request that, unless you object to the Irish Church\r\n    Bill, you will come over and give us the benefit of your vote on\r\n    Friday.\r\n\r\n    It is not often that the vote of the Ambassador at Paris is wanted,\r\n    and if I remember rightly, Cowley only once or twice sent me his\r\n    proxy; but proxies are now abolished, and the real presence is\r\n    necessary. Every vote is of importance, as the question is one of\r\n    great gravity not only as respects the Irish Church but the conflict\r\n    between the two Houses that is impending, and that must if possible\r\n    be averted.\r\n\r\n    Gladstone has just expressed a strong opinion as to the duty of a\r\n    peer not to abstain from voting when he is not disabled from doing\r\n    so, and does not admit that diplomatic convenience is a sufficient\r\n    reason against his doing so.\r\n\r\n    I hope therefore you will come over if you are not opposed to the\r\n    Bill.\r\n\r\nIt being practically impossible to resist an intimation of this kind\r\nfrom an official chief, Lord Lyons reluctantly went over to London to\r\nvote, and as he had not yet even taken his seat, took the precaution of\r\nasking a trusty friend in the Foreign Office to find out what the\r\nnecessary formalities were. The following somewhat naïve communication\r\npossesses a modern interest as it discloses the fact that backwoodsmen\r\nwere as much in existence then as they are now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Staveley to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, June 16, 1869.\r\n\r\n    Not being able to get any reliable information in the Foreign Office\r\n    as to your _modus operandi_ in regard to taking your seat to-morrow,\r\n    I have been down to the House of Lords this afternoon and saw one of\r\n    the clerks in the Crown Office, who says that all you have to do is\r\n    to present yourself at the Peers' entrance to-morrow not later than\r\n    4.45 p.m., when you will receive from the clerk in attendance for\r\n    that purpose the necessary writ to enable you to take your seat.\r\n\r\n    Nothing further is necessary, and many peers presented themselves\r\n    and took their seats for the first time this session, for the debate\r\n    of Monday last, with no further formalities.\r\n\r\nThe obvious comment on this incident is that Mr. Gladstone and his\r\ncolleagues were totally wanting in a sense of proportion, and their\r\naction justifies the belief that the eminent persons who govern this\r\ncountry are sometimes literally incapable of looking beyond the next\r\ndivision list in Parliament.\r\n\r\nIf a British Ambassador is to inspire confidence in his countrymen\r\nit is all important that he should not be a partisan or dependent in any\r\ndegree upon party favours. The majority for the second reading of the\r\nBill was 33, and no fewer than 108 peers were absent from the division\r\nunpaired. Yet because the whip (probably a person of very mediocre\r\nintelligence) said that he wanted every vote that could be obtained, the\r\nAmbassador was sent for, made to figure as a party hack, and forced to\r\ngive a vote on a question of which he had admittedly no knowledge, and\r\nupon which his opinion was valueless. It will be seen later that similar\r\nattempts to force him to vote were subsequently made by people who ought\r\nto have known better, but fortunately without much success.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of April, 1869, the French Legislative Session came to\r\nan end, and with it expired the Chamber elected in 1863. The General\r\nElection took place in May, and, as an insignificant number of\r\nopposition deputies were returned, owing to the unscrupulous\r\nintervention of the Executive, the results were received with much\r\nsatisfaction in Government circles. It was generally felt, however, that\r\neven the huge Government majority would be more independent than in the\r\nlate Chamber, and that a very real control would be exercised over the\r\nMinisters. It was even expected by some that the Emperor would formally\r\nannounce the acceptance of the principle of the responsibility of\r\nMinisters to Parliament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 25, 1869.\r\n\r\n    I understand that the result of the elections gives pleasure at the\r\n    Tuileries. The Imperialists generally seem very well satisfied.\r\n    They consider the result to be a complete defeat of the Orleanists,\r\n    a defeat of the Legitimists and a defeat of the moderate\r\n    Republicans; the Chamber being thus divided into supporters of the\r\n    dynasty and Ultra-Republicans. They think the prominence of the\r\n    _Spectre Rouge_ will frighten and unite the people at large, and\r\n    cause them to rally round the dynasty. I cannot help being afraid\r\n    that there are more _rouges_ elected than is very safe, and the\r\n    election of such a sanguinary socialist as Baucel both at Paris and\r\n    Lyons is an uncomfortable symptom. The opposition will not be\r\n    inconveniently numerous, and its violence will be in all probability\r\n    simply a source of weakness.\r\n\r\n    I could not get Rouher to listen to any hint to propose to Prussia\r\n    that a French vessel should be sent to Jahde,[14] though he seemed\r\n    willing enough to send one if invited. You have, however, I think,\r\n    entirely prevented them having any suspicion of our having been\r\n    coquetting with Prussia, or having been willing to curry favour with\r\n    her at the expense of France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 29, 1869.\r\n\r\n    It is very generally believed that Rouher will be made the scapegoat\r\n    and placed in the honourable retreat of the Presidency of the\r\n    Senate. Since the great rally of the Moderates to the dynasty it has\r\n    become the fashion to throw upon Rouher personally the blame of all\r\n    the measures which he has had to defend. I don't know who can be\r\n    found to take his place as Government orator.\r\n\r\n    Speculation is occupied in divining how the Emperor will take the\r\n    elections. Some think that, finding himself in front of an\r\n    opposition of _Rouges_, he will again take the part of the Saviour\r\n    of Society and begin a new epoch of Cæsarism. Others, looking to the\r\n    comparatively large number of independent members, whose elections\r\n    the Government did not oppose, and to the liberal professions made\r\n    even by the official candidates, expect a formal announcement of the\r\n    responsibility of Ministers to the Chamber, and Parliamentary\r\n    Government in form and in fact. An opinion not the least probable is\r\n    that His Majesty will make no change, but appoint Ministers and\r\n    direct his policy more or less in deference to the Chamber,\r\n    according to circumstances.\r\n\r\n    I hope Beust's meddling in the Belgian question has been merely an\r\n    awkward attempt to curry favour with the Emperor, but it may have\r\n    had the mischievous effect of encouraging fresh pretensions on the\r\n    part of France. Jealousy of Prussia will for a long time to come\r\n    ensure sympathy between France and Austria.\r\n\r\nThe complacent feelings with which the election results were at first\r\nreceived at the Tuileries soon gave place to very different emotions. M.\r\nde La Valette was under no illusion as to the unimportance of a victory\r\nover the Orleanists, and had frequently assured the Emperor that they\r\nhad no real backing in the country, and that His Majesty's extreme\r\nsusceptibility with regard to the attention shown to the Princes of that\r\nHouse by the Court and by society in England was totally unnecessary.\r\nThe more the elections were considered the less they were liked. It\r\nbegan to dawn upon the Emperor that it had been a mistake to help the\r\nReds with a view to crushing the Orleanists or Moderate Liberals. A\r\nmajority in the Chamber was indeed secured to the official candidates,\r\nbut the moral weight of the votes given for them was small, for the\r\ninfluence of the Government had been unsparingly and unscrupulously used\r\nto secure their return, and even the official candidates had, with few\r\nexceptions, been forced to issue very Liberal addresses. Fear of the\r\nextreme men might bring the officials and the independent members\r\ntogether in the Chamber, but it was generally realized that the\r\nGovernment would have to go at least halfway to meet the Liberals. In\r\nshort, it was difficult to conceal the fact that the elections had not\r\nresulted in a manifestation of confidence in the Imperial Government,\r\nand that they had shown that the party bent upon revolution at any price\r\nwas dangerously large. Under these circumstances it was not surprising\r\nthat the French Government showed itself alarmed and irritable, and\r\nalthough the country appeared to have declared against war there were\r\nnot wanting Imperialists who would have been ready to look upon a\r\nprovocation from abroad as a godsend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, June 8, 1869.\r\n\r\n    The elections of yesterday in Paris seem to me satisfactory, for I\r\n    certainly prefer Orleanists and Moderate Republicans to Reds, and it\r\n    is a great thing to be rid of all the questions Rochefort's return\r\n    would have produced. In the Provinces the official candidates seem\r\n    to have had the worst of it.\r\n\r\n    The lessons to be drawn from the general election are not pleasant,\r\n    for it is impossible to find anywhere a symptom of approval of\r\n    personal government. It is not that the French desire a\r\n    Parliamentary government _à l'Anglaise_, but they are tired of the\r\n    uncertainty and disquiet in which they are kept by the fact that\r\n    peace and war, and indeed everything, depend upon the inscrutable\r\n    will of one man whom they do believe capable of giving them\r\n    surprises, and whom they no longer believe to be infallible. I don't\r\n    like the look of things. I dare say we shall be quiet for some time,\r\n    but like the French public, I live in dread of a surprise.\r\n\r\n    It is true that Fleury is likely to go as Minister to Florence,\r\n    though it is a secret. He would keep his office of Grand Ecuyer, but\r\n    he would go because he felt that he had lost his influence with\r\n    the Emperor and would not choose to stay here only to look after\r\n    horses and carriages. I don't think his departure a good sign. He\r\n    has lately been rather liberal in politics, and he is one of the few\r\n    men who would be certainly true to the Emperor and brave and\r\n    resolute if it came to actual fighting in the streets. The object of\r\n    his mission to Florence would be to manage the withdrawal of the\r\n    French troops from Rome. I have no doubt the Emperor wants to\r\n    withdraw them, but he wants also to be sure that the Pope will be\r\n    safe without them. I dare say, too, that His Majesty is angry about\r\n    the conduct of the clergy in the elections. They voted according to\r\n    their own predilections, and certainly did not make the support of\r\n    the Government a primary object.\r\n\r\nGeneral Fleury, a man of charming personality, and a prominent figure in\r\nFrench society, was the author of the celebrated rejoinder, _Pourtant,\r\nnous nous sommes diablement bien amusés_, upon an occasion when the\r\nSecond Empire was severely criticized some years later. Lord Clarendon\r\nwas another of those who felt misgivings over the elections. 'I feel\r\nprecisely as you do,' he wrote to Lord Lyons, 'about the elections and\r\nthe danger of a surprise that they create. Cæsar thinks only of his\r\ndynasty, and I expect he foresees greater danger to it from responsible\r\nGovernment than from war. It is not surprising that the French should be\r\nexasperated at always living on a volcano and never knowing when it may\r\nburst out and what mischief it may do them. The Bourgeoisie and the\r\n_actionnaires_ must fear revolution, but they must be beginning to weigh\r\nits evils against those which they are now suffering from. Fleury was a\r\nfriend of peace and of England, and I am very sorry that he should so\r\nmuch have lost his influence as to make him accept a foreign mission.'\r\n\r\nThe elections were followed by a certain amount of rioting in Paris, and\r\nsome hundreds of persons were arrested, but the only effect of these\r\ndisorders was to strengthen the hands of those who advised the Emperor\r\nto hold fast to absolute and personal government. The latter was quite\r\nwilling to sacrifice individuals to the Chamber, and was aware of the\r\nnecessity of making some concessions in a Liberal sense, but he\r\ncontinued to resist any extension of the power of the Legislative Body.\r\nThe latter might have obtained what was desired by calm and patience,\r\nfor no minister would have been strong enough to successfully withstand\r\nthe demand, but it is not in the nature of Frenchmen to achieve\r\npractical successes without noise and ostentation, and it was plain that\r\ntroublous times were ahead. Had Napoleon III. been wise he would have\r\ntaken the bull by the horns and announced something that would have\r\nsatisfied the Chamber and the country. Unfortunately, the one thing he\r\nrefused to give up was the one thing which his opponents were determined\r\nto wrest from him--personal government.\r\n\r\nIn July the Constitutional agitation was advanced a stage by an\r\nimportant interpellation of the Government demanding that the country\r\nshould be given a greater share in the direction of affairs and asking\r\nfor a ministry responsible to the Chamber. This demand was very\r\nnumerously signed, and much to the general surprise amongst the\r\nsignatures were many names belonging to the Government majority. It was\r\nevident that the country and the Chamber were determined to put some\r\ncheck on personal government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 7, 1869.\r\n\r\n    We are going on here _à toute vitesse_, whither, it is not very\r\n    pleasant to think. A new form has been agreed upon for the famous\r\n    interpellation.\r\n\r\n    More than a hundred Deputies have signed the demand, and among the\r\n    signatories are to be found even some of the regular courtiers, such\r\n    as Prince Joachim Murat and the Duc de Mouchy. It is entirely\r\n    illegal for the Corps Legislatif to discuss the Constitution, but\r\n    things seem to have gone much too far for such scruples to have any\r\n    weight. It would be amusing, if it were not rather alarming, to see\r\n    the eagerness among men of all parties to be forward in the race\r\n    towards Liberalism. Rouher preaches patience and moderation, but the\r\n    Oracle from St. Cloud gives no certain response to the many votaries\r\n    who try to extract a declaration of its views. This it is, which has\r\n    been one of the main causes of the falling away of the Imperial\r\n    Deputies. To keep the majority together, it would have been\r\n    necessary that a distinct _mot d'ordre_ should have been given them,\r\n    the moment the Chamber met. No one is willing to take the unpopular\r\n    side without some assurance that he will not be thrown over by the\r\n    Prince he wishes to serve; and what is worse, the want of decision\r\n    shown has very much diminished confidence in the resolution and\r\n    ability of the Sovereign, and consequently the willingness of\r\n    politicians to throw their lot in with his. When one looks at the\r\n    position in which things stood, I will not say before the election,\r\n    but between the election and the meeting of the Chamber, one is\r\n    astonished at the rapid descent of the personal power and the\r\n    reputation. Whether concessions will come in time to enable him to\r\n    stop before he is dragged to the bottom of the hill, is even\r\n    beginning to be questioned.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de La Tour d'Auvergne, the French Ambassador in London, who\r\nwas much astonished at the number of persons who had signed the\r\nInterpellation Demand, told Lord Clarendon that the French Government\r\nhad brought it entirely on themselves by the scandals perpetrated at the\r\nelections. Both he and Lord Clarendon were convinced that Rouher was\r\ndestined to be the Imperial scapegoat. In this they were correct.\r\nRouher resigned; and La Tour d'Auvergne himself changed places with La\r\nValette.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, July 14, 1869.\r\n\r\n    When France enters upon a new road it is difficult to guess where it\r\n    will lead her to, and revolution may be looming in the distance, but\r\n    I think and hope it may be staved off for a time. The Senate will\r\n    probably put on as many checks as it dares, and the Emperor will\r\n    have a good many dodges for defeating his own programme, but he has\r\n    proceeded so unskilfully that he must have shaken the confidence of\r\n    those whose support he ought to reckon upon.\r\n\r\n    He should at once, after the unmistakeable verdict of the country\r\n    against personal government, have made up his mind how far he would\r\n    go with, or resist public opinion, and not have left his supporters\r\n    without that _mot d'ordre_ that Frenchmen cannot dispense with; but\r\n    his silence compelled them to speak, and no one will now persuade\r\n    the people that he has not yielded to the threatened interpellation.\r\n\r\n    If they are once thoroughly impressed with the notion that he is\r\n    squeezable they will continue to squeeze him, and the language held\r\n    even by his immediate entourage is ominous. The middle-class fear of\r\n    violent charges, and, above all, of the Reds, may come to his aid,\r\n    but he must be sadly in want of sound advice. Rouher's retirement,\r\n    even though it be temporary, is, I conclude, indispensable, but I\r\n    hope the Imperial confidence will not be given to Drouyn, who\r\n    besides being the most untrustworthy of men, is the most dangerous\r\n    of councillors. The point which concerns us most is the successor to\r\n    La Valette, whose resignation Prince La Tour bears with perfect\r\n    equanimity.\r\n\r\nThe ministerial changes seemed to produce no beneficial effects as far\r\nas the Emperor's position was concerned, and the letters from the\r\nAmbassador became increasingly pessimistic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 27, 1869.\r\n\r\n    I grieve to say that the Emperor seems to lose ground. His own\r\n    partisans seem more and more to doubt his having energy and decision\r\n    enough to hold himself and them. What is serious is that this doubt\r\n    is strong among the generals. They would stick to him if they felt\r\n    sure of him, because a reduction of the army is one of the leading\r\n    doctrines of his opponents. Prince Napoleon has found an occasion\r\n    for having a letter published repudiating all responsibility for the\r\n    conduct of the Government of late years. I have been told very\r\n    confidentially that the Empress complained bitterly to the Grand\r\n    Duchess Mary of Russia of the inconstancy and ingratitude of the\r\n    French people, and said that if the people were tired of her and the\r\n    Emperor, they were quite ready to leave the country and save their\r\n    son from the dangerous and thankless task of trying to content\r\n    France. No one seems to apprehend any immediate danger. The general\r\n    impression is that if the Senatus Consultum is a fair execution of\r\n    the promises in the message, things will go on quietly enough until\r\n    the meeting of the Chamber, which may be safely put off till\r\n    December. The most hopeful sign to my mind is the reasonable and\r\n    Constitutional way in which the French seem to be getting accustomed\r\n    to work for Reforms. If the Emperor sees pretty clearly what to\r\n    yield and what to keep, and will express his intentions in time and\r\n    stick to them, all may go well yet. But can decision and firmness be\r\n    inspired, if they are not in the natural character, or the\r\n    reputation for them, if once lost, be recovered?\r\n\r\nIn spite of the evident deterioration in Napoleon's position and of the\r\ngrowing distrust in him which was now universally felt, unfavourable\r\nrumours as to the state of his health caused something resembling a\r\npanic. The French funds, which were higher than they had ever been\r\nbefore, fell suddenly in August. They had risen because the\r\nConstitutional concessions were believed to make it certain that the\r\nEmperor would not make war: they fell because alarming reports were\r\nspread about his ill-health. As a matter of fact, he was suffering from\r\nrheumatism, and there was no real danger, but there is always a\r\ndifficulty in ascertaining the truth about illustrious invalids. Much\r\ninconvenience and delay, however, were caused by his indisposition, for\r\nit seems to have been his habit to retire to bed at any hour of the day,\r\nif he felt unwell, and there was no certainty of seeing him, even when\r\nhe made an appointment. As his plans depended upon his health, and as\r\nthere was further a certain amount of complication caused by the\r\nprojected visit of the Empress to the East, nobody quite knew what would\r\nhappen, and the _joueurs à la baisse_ profited by the situation to bring\r\noff a big _coup_ on the Bourse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Weisbaden, Aug. 31, 1869.\r\n\r\n    I hope the report given to you of the Emperor's health is correct.\r\n    The banker has told me to-day that he had not remembered for years\r\n    such a panic at Frankfort as was produced by the news that he was\r\n    dangerously ill. If his illness is not serious and he soon gets well\r\n    again, the fright will rather do good as making people awake to the\r\n    enormous importance of his life. Even, however, if he lives, your\r\n    able despatch describing the state and the prospect of affairs in\r\n    France gives cause sufficient for anxiety, and I have an instinct\r\n    that they will drift into a republic before another year is over.\r\n\r\nHad Lord Clarendon lived a few months longer he would have been able to\r\ncongratulate himself upon one of the most accurate political prophecies\r\non record, for the Republic was actually proclaimed in Paris on\r\nSeptember 4, 1870. It should be added that his voluminous letters show\r\na thorough knowledge of and profound insight into French politics.\r\n\r\nThe political situation in France at the end of August, 1869, was, on\r\nthe whole, apparently somewhat more reassuring than had been the case\r\nearlier in the year. The Emperor's message announcing a great\r\nConstitutional reform had been read in the Corps Législatif in July,\r\nand was followed by a general amnesty for all political and press\r\noffences. The change of Ministry was well received, because it involved\r\nthe retirement of M. Rouher, the ablest supporter of the old system of\r\ngovernment, although it was known that many eminent deputies were\r\nunwilling to take office until the Constitutional change had come into\r\neffect. The general impression produced upon the public was favourable,\r\nand although many Liberals were careful to declare that they accepted\r\nthe proffered changes simply as an instalment, only the\r\nultra-Republicans and irreconcilables affected to repudiate them and\r\ntreat them with contempt. Even the latter, however, were obliged to\r\nexpress approval of the amnesty. Meanwhile the country had remained\r\ncalm, and so far, the stream of reform appeared to be flowing swiftly\r\nand with unruffled surface. Close observers, however, were under no\r\nillusion as to the critical situation which was concealed behind these\r\nfavourable appearances.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the Monarchy and of order in France depended as much\r\nupon the Emperor as it had done during the early years of his reign, and\r\nhe was far from being as strong as then. He had been at the head of the\r\nGovernment for more than eighteen years, and the temperament of the\r\nFrench seemed to preclude the idea that they could tolerate any rule for\r\na lengthy period. A young generation had sprung up free from the dread\r\nof the bloodshed and disorder which accompanied the revolution of 1848,\r\nand eager for change and excitement. The Emperor's foreign policy had\r\nnot of late years succeeded in gratifying the national pride, nor had\r\nhis recent concessions done as much as might have been expected to\r\nrecover his reputation. The ultra-Imperialists believed that if he had\r\nshown resolution and decision immediately after the General Election, no\r\nreforms would have been necessary; they thought that the reforms became\r\ninevitable simply because he vacillated and gave his majority no\r\nassurance of support. The Liberals had not much belief in his good\r\nfaith, and the friends of the Empire entertained a well-grounded fear\r\nthat the new powers granted to the people would be used for the purpose\r\nof overthrowing the dynasty and establishing a republic. On the one\r\nhand, there was an impression that the Emperor had no longer sufficient\r\nfirmness to resist these subversive attempts; on the other, the Liberals\r\nfound it difficult to believe that a sovereign who had for many years\r\nexercised so directly, in his own person, absolute power, could ever be\r\nbrought voluntarily to abandon it. Thus there was apprehension on both\r\nsides, and while some feared that the Emperor would be led from\r\nconcession to concession until he had no power left, others feared that,\r\nfinding it impossible to reconcile himself to his new position, he would\r\nhave recourse to some violent expedient, such as war or a _coup d'état_,\r\nin order to extricate himself from his difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt was generally taken for granted that the choice lay between the\r\nBonaparte dynasty and a republic of an extreme character. The Emperor\r\nstill retained some personal popularity, but he no longer inspired the\r\nfear and the admiration which had hitherto prevented revolutionary\r\nattempts. His best chance seemed to lie in foreign Governments treating\r\ninternational questions in such a way as to enhance as far as possible\r\nhis reputation, and it was certainly not to the interest of England that\r\nhe should be displaced, for his own commercial policy was decidedly\r\nliberal, and it was highly doubtful whether the Corps Législatif would\r\nbe equally so, when it came to dealing with Tariffs and Commercial\r\nTreaties.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Lyons returned from his leave in November, he found the\r\nEmperor in good spirits, full of amiable sentiments with regard to\r\nEngland, and very cheerful about the political prospects in France. He\r\ndid not appear to know much about the Porte and Khedive question,\r\nwhich had for some time been giving rise to considerable trouble, but\r\nresponded at once to the Ambassador's appeal to his own _amour propre_\r\nin favour of the Commercial Treaty, which seemed to be in jeopardy. The\r\nEmpress had gone to the East, and he was consoling himself for her\r\nabsence by giving small dances at the Tuileries for some American young\r\nladies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 3, 1869.\r\n\r\n    I am more than ever impatient to settle this Khedive affair because\r\n    I am afraid that I see symptoms of the French Press taking up his\r\n    cause against his lawful master. La Tour d'Auvergne's tenure of\r\n    office is very precarious, and if he goes before it is settled, his\r\n    successor is as likely as not to take the popular side, which in\r\n    France is undoubtedly that of the contumacious vassal. La Tour\r\n    d'Auvergne is himself uneasy, and it is apparent that it is only the\r\n    desire to act with us which keeps the Emperor from taking the\r\n    Khedive's side decidedly. If the Porte plays many more of these\r\n    pranks, it will bring about the independence of Egypt, or a quarrel\r\n    between England and France on the subject.\r\n\r\n    It is in vain to draw any conclusions from the proceedings of the\r\n    Deputies, or the innumerable commentaries made upon them. The\r\n    Ministers profess to be delighted with the elections of President\r\n    and Vice-Presidents, but then I cannot forget that they were\r\n    enchanted for the first few days with the results of the General\r\n    Election which produced the present Chamber. My own hope is that out\r\n    of the chaos a working Liberal-Conservative majority will be\r\n    developed; but who is to be the Minister? Emile Ollivier seems to be\r\n    losing, not gaining ground in the Chamber. If the Emperor goes\r\n    straight and throws himself a little more on the classes, who,\r\n    having something to lose, are naturally conservative, he may do well\r\n    yet. There is certainly a return of goodwill towards him. The fear\r\n    is that he may hope to strengthen himself by coquetting with his pet\r\n    ouvriers, who have so little gratitude for the really important\r\n    services he has rendered them. If reproached, they answer, he has\r\n    done something for us, but what have we not done for him? What I\r\n    mean by coquetting with them, is trying to gain by their support,\r\n    power, and popularity at the expense of the Chamber.\r\n\r\n    I can't pretend to say whether the new majority will hold together\r\n    when the question of distributing the places arises; whether they\r\n    will find it possible to get on with the Emperor, or (which most\r\n    concerns us) whether they can and will maintain the Commercial\r\n    Treaty. I am afraid we shall never again, either in political or\r\n    commercial affairs, have as good times as we had under the personal\r\n    power of the Emperor--by _we_ of course I mean the _English_.\r\n\r\nWith this sentiment Lord Clarendon fully concurred: the Emperor, he\r\nsaid, was parting with power so reluctantly that he would create\r\ndistrust, but 'I quite agree with you that we shall never have such good\r\ntimes again under a Parliamentary instead of a personal _régime_.'\r\n\r\nA few days after this letter was written, La Tour d'Auvergne and his\r\ncolleagues were already anxious to resign, although the Emperor wished\r\nto retain them. It was supposed that Drouyn de Lhuys would be one of\r\ntheir successors: 'Angels and Ministers of grace, defend us!' was the\r\ncomment of Lord Lyons upon this rumour, which Lord Clarendon received\r\nwith equal apprehension. Another political event at this juncture was an\r\nannouncement by the Empress that she intended to keep aloof from\r\npolitics in the future, and to devote herself to works of charity--an\r\nannouncement which did not carry universal conviction at the time.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet, which was in so shaky a condition, contained some nominal\r\nfree traders, and it was feared, not without cause, that the new\r\nGovernment might denounce the existing Commercial Treaty, although La\r\nTour d'Auvergne expressed confidence that such would not be the case. 'I\r\nhave my misgivings,' wrote the Ambassador, sadly, 'for I am afraid the\r\ncountry is Protectionist, and I think the Free Trade zeal in the south\r\nwill cool, as they become aware that we shall not retaliate.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Dec. 21, 1869.\r\n\r\n    Nothing but absolute force will turn French Ministers and their\r\n    wives from their sumptuous official palaces. La Tour d'Auvergne,\r\n    whom I should indeed like to keep, is really anxious to go. I don't\r\n    feel sure that any of the others are. I suppose the Emperor must\r\n    change the Ministry as soon as the verification of powers is over,\r\n    but he has not made up his mind yet, and his hesitation is doing him\r\n    harm in all ways. There is, I believe, a Conservative reaction, or\r\n    rather a revival of the fear of the red spectre in the country. The\r\n    Emperor may turn this to good account, if he will govern\r\n    constitutionally through a Parliamentary Ministry, but it will not\r\n    sustain him in a return to personal government.\r\n\r\n    I don't think things look well for the Commercial Treaty, and the\r\n    notion of some Free Traders that it should be denounced on account\r\n    of its origin, and with a view to making a greater advance towards\r\n    real free trade, will probably give the _coup de grâce_ to it.\r\n    The difficulty of passing new free trade measures through the Chamber\r\n    would, I should think, be infinitely greater than that of\r\n    maintaining the present Treaty.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the new Government was not actually completed before\r\nthe end of the year, although the Emperor in true Constitutional fashion\r\nwrote a letter to M. Emile Ollivier in his own hand, asking him to form\r\na Cabinet. There was a feeling that his Ministry would not be long\r\nlived, and moderate men shrank from joining it, thus playing into the\r\nhands of the revolutionary parties. Amongst those who thought that the\r\nnew Government would be short-lived was Lord Clarendon--\r\n\r\n    'Ollivier's task,' he wrote, 'requires tact, experience, firmness,\r\n    knowledge of men, and a few other qualities in which he seems\r\n    singularly deficient, and I cannot think his Ministry will last. La\r\n    Valette thinks that the object of the implacables is to discredit\r\n    the Chamber collectively and individually, so as to make its\r\n    dissolution appear a necessity; then to pass a new electoral law;\r\n    then to have a General Election with which the Government would be\r\n    prohibited from interfering; then to have a Chamber of Rocheforts\r\n    and Raspails, which would be more than the _commencement de la fin_.\r\n\r\n    'This is rather a gloomy view, expressed confidentially, of course,\r\n    and we must hope that the Emperor will be able to defeat intrigues\r\n    of the existence and gravity of which he must be well aware.'\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the general uncertainty prevailing, it may be\r\nmentioned that M. de La Valette, until the contents of the Emperor's\r\nletter to Emile Ollivier became known, was convinced that Imperial\r\nindecision would take the form of resumption of absolute power.\r\n\r\nThe new ministry was finally completed in the early days of January,\r\n1870, and proved to be considerably stronger than had been believed\r\npossible. Some of the new Ministers had curious antecedents with regard\r\nto the Emperor. Ollivier himself had previously been an opponent of the\r\nEmpire, and his father had been sentenced to be deported to Cayenne,\r\nwhile Count Daru, the new Foreign Minister, had actually voted for the\r\nEmperor's impeachment. It was creditable, therefore, that personal\r\nmatters did not exclude men from office. What chiefly concerned England\r\nwas the line which the new Government was likely to take with regard to\r\nthe Commercial Treaty which was about to expire. According to the\r\nEmperor, there was nothing to fear, and he assured the Ambassador that\r\nhe had come to an understanding with Ollivier on the subject, but it was\r\nominous that several members of the Cabinet were ardent Protectionists,\r\namongst them being the Minister of Public Works. In conversation the\r\nEmperor spoke cheerfully about the political situation, quite in the\r\ntone of a Constitutional Monarch. The Empress, on her side, declared\r\nthat she had no _caractère politique_ in the State, and enlarged on the\r\nenormity of the attacks in the press upon a person so entirely without\r\npolitical position, attacks which were certainly odious, and generally\r\ndirected to matters unconnected with politics. As for the Ministers,\r\nthey all praised the Emperor, and declared that their relations with him\r\nwere perfectly Constitutional and satisfactory; everything seemed going\r\nsmoothly until the death of the journalist Victor Noir at the hands of\r\nPrince Pierre Bonaparte once more threw politics into confusion. After a\r\ncertain amount of rioting, however, and much trouble caused by\r\nRochefort, things resumed their usual condition for the time being.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 18, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I am one of the hopeful, and I see or fancy I see signs of the\r\n    success of the present Ministry in their attempt to found\r\n    Parliamentary Government. But people are very uneasy, and the\r\n    tactics of the Revolutionists are to keep up an agitation enough to\r\n    paralyze trade, and make the peaceably-disposed think that the\r\n    present Government is not strong enough to be worth having. These\r\n    manoeuvres might lead to a resumption of personal power, which\r\n    would be almost as dangerous as a republican revolution.\r\n\r\n    People seem to find it difficult to believe that the Emperor will\r\n    abstain from intriguing against his Ministers. They say it is in his\r\n    nature to do so, and remind one that he set up a newspaper against\r\n    Rouher. The Ministers themselves, on the other hand, seem to be\r\n    thoroughly satisfied with His Majesty. Daru says that he and his\r\n    colleagues are confident of success; that they would have two or\r\n    three difficult months to pass, but that they expect to have\r\n    convinced the Republicans by that time that a revolution is hopeless.\r\n    He spoke with great satisfaction of the complete adhesion of the\r\n    middle class at Paris to the Ministry, and of the offers they make\r\n    of their services in case of need.\r\n\r\n    Claremont saw the Emperor this afternoon. He thought His Majesty\r\n    looking fat and heavy. He found an opportunity of making a remark to\r\n    him on the necessity of the Ministry being supported by the Chamber,\r\n    which seems to have been taken in good part.\r\n\r\n    I hear on good authority that the Empress professes to find much\r\n    greater good than she expected in the Parliamentary Government, and\r\n    that she says the Pierre Bonaparte affair would have been much more\r\n    disastrous under the old system. Several of the new Ministers and\r\n    their wives appeared last night at a ball at the Tuileries for the\r\n    first time since 1848. The Empress, as well as the Emperor, was\r\n    particularly gracious to them.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned in connection with the Tuileries balls, that the\r\nAmbassador used to receive very numerous applications from persons in\r\nEnglish society who were desirous of being invited to these\r\nentertainments, and it was usually not possible to satisfy their wishes.\r\nAfter the fall of the Empire, this particular species of application\r\npractically disappeared, there being apparently no overwhelming anxiety\r\nto attend the Republican social functions.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of January an important debate took place in the Chamber\r\non the Commercial Treaty, M. Thiers appearing as the chief Protectionist\r\nchampion. Free Traders professed to derive some encouragement from it,\r\nas a vote against the denunciation of the Treaty was carried by 211 to\r\n32; but it was obvious that these figures could not be taken as a test\r\nvote of the strength of the Free Trade and Protectionist parties, since\r\nthe votes of the majority were influenced by a variety of\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [11] The vanity which was responsible for Prince Gortschakoff's love\r\n  of conferences is frequently referred to in Busch's 'Bismarck.'\r\n\r\n  [12] Subsequently Lord Ampthill.\r\n\r\n  [13] Prussian Ambassador in London.\r\n\r\n  [14] Now Wilhelmshafen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSECRET PROPOSALS FOR DISARMAMENT\r\n\r\n(1870)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in October, 1868, the French Government had\r\npractically suggested that Her Majesty's Government should 'give advice'\r\nto Prussia on the subject of disarmament, and that Lord Stanley, who was\r\nForeign Secretary at the time had resolutely declined to do anything of\r\nthe kind. A fresh effort was now made in the same direction, no details\r\nof which, so far as is known, have ever been made public.\r\n\r\n_Mutatus mutandis_, there was a curious similarity between the language\r\nheld at Paris and at Berlin respectively. The French proclaimed that\r\nthey would not go to war with the Prussians, provided the latter did\r\nnothing objectionable. The Prussians replied that they did not want to\r\ngo to war with France, provided they were allowed to do as they pleased,\r\nand both asserted that the maintenance of peace depended upon England,\r\nwhich they explained by affirming that England had only to declare that\r\nshe would join against whichever Power broke the peace; the real meaning\r\nof this being that at Paris it was expected that England should announce\r\nbeforehand that she would side with France in case of war, while at\r\nBerlin it meant that she should announce beforehand that she would side\r\nwith Prussia.\r\n\r\nEarly in January it had become known to the British Government, and\r\npresumably also to the French Government, that Bismarck intended to\r\ncreate a North German Empire, and that the King of Prussia was by no\r\nmeans disinclined to become an Emperor, and it may have been this\r\nknowledge which prompted the French Government to make another attempt\r\nto induce England to suggest disarmament. It was felt that the only\r\nchance of success was to set about the work as quietly as possible, and\r\nif there was one individual who was better fitted than any other to\r\nundertake this delicate task it was undoubtedly Lord Clarendon, who, as\r\nhas already been pointed out, was on intimate terms with the principal\r\npersonages concerned. Lord Clarendon was approached in January by La\r\nValette, the French Ambassador, and consented to make the attempt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, Jan. 26, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I had a long talk with La Valette to-day about disarmament. It is no\r\n    new subject to me, but one which I have long had at heart, although\r\n    it presents serious difficulties on account of the King of Prussia's\r\n    obstinacy. He does not meditate, or desire war--far from it. But his\r\n    army is his idol, and he won't make himself an iconoclast. Not so\r\n    the Crown Prince, with whom I discussed the subject at great length\r\n    a year ago. Our relations with Prussia are very friendly, and\r\n    perhaps we are in as good a position as any other Power to make an\r\n    attempt to bell the cat, and Count Daru may be sure that I will do\r\n    all I can to meet his views, but I am sure that he will admit that\r\n    some tact and _ménagements_ are necessary. I spoke to Gortchakoff\r\n    in the summer about Prussian disarmament, and he entirely concurred,\r\n    though he said Russia would take no initiative.\r\n\r\nFurther letters from Lord Clarendon emphasized the necessity of keeping\r\nthe matter secret, and authorized Lord Lyons to assure the French\r\nGovernment that it would not be compromised in any way, and that he\r\nundertook the business with hearty good will, but with small hope of\r\nsuccess, as the King of Prussia was almost unapproachable on the subject\r\nof the army.\r\n\r\nOn January 30th, M. Emile Ollivier called upon Lord Lyons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Jan. 30, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I have just had a visit from M. Emile Ollivier and we have spoken\r\n    confidentially on several subjects.\r\n\r\n    The thing uppermost in his mind was Disarmament. He said he was very\r\n    anxious that England should exert her influence with Prussia. He\r\n    explained the position of the present French Ministers with regard\r\n    to the subject. They depended, he said, principally on the great\r\n    agricultural population of France for support against Socialism and\r\n    Revolution. It was essential therefore that they should do something\r\n    for that population. To conciliate them, either taxes might be\r\n    remitted or the call upon them for recruits be diminished. There\r\n    were great difficulties in the way of remitting taxes, and when a\r\n    reduction of the army was proposed, the Ministers were met by the\r\n    Emperor and the military party with a declaration that it would be\r\n    unsafe to diminish the forces of France, while those of Prussia were\r\n    on their present footing--that the effect would be that Prussia\r\n    would make some attempt on Southern Germany, and war be the\r\n    consequence. If, however, Prussia would make a simultaneous\r\n    disarmament, all would, he thought, be well and a great security for\r\n    peace would be given. It was true that the Prussians urged that\r\n    their army was on a peace footing already, and that they could not\r\n    be expected to change their whole military system, but M. Ollivier\r\n    conceived that while no doubt the Prussian system enabled the\r\n    Government to call nearly the whole male population to arms, it\r\n    depended upon the Government to decide how many it would actually\r\n    call upon each year.\r\n\r\n    I explained to M. Ollivier the difficulty and delicacy of the\r\n    question, the peculiar views of the present King of Prussia, and the\r\n    small hope there could be of prevailing upon His Majesty to consent\r\n    to a reduction of the army. I said that it would be your special\r\n    care that the French Government should not be compromised by any\r\n    step you might take. I added that it was plain that the only chance\r\n    of success was to approach Prussia in a strictly confidential\r\n    manner; that any formal diplomatic move on our part would be\r\n    resented or misrepresented as a pretension to interfere in the\r\n    internal affairs of the country, and would expose France as well as\r\n    ourselves to a rebuff.\r\n\r\n    M. Ollivier said that he was extremely grateful to you, and that he\r\n    entirely concurred in the opinion that the move must be made in a\r\n    cautious and confidential manner. He was particularly alive to the\r\n    importance of not exposing France to the appearance of being\r\n    slighted; in fact, he would not conceal from me that, under present\r\n    circumstances, a public rebuff from Prussia would be fatal. '_Un\r\n    échec_,' he said, '_c'est la guerre_!' Those who had to render an\r\n    account to Parliament and the country were less able than the former\r\n    Government to put up with any wound to the national pride. Their\r\n    main object was peace, but they must show firmness, or they would\r\n    not be able to cope with Revolution and Socialism at home.\r\n\r\n    M. Ollivier went on to say that, whether we succeeded or not at the\r\n    present moment, it was very necessary that the way should be paved\r\n    for disarmament in Prussia, and that it should be felt that England\r\n    was in favour of it. The time must come when France would be obliged\r\n    to make a public proposal to Prussia to disarm: it was impossible\r\n    that the French Government could assume, in the eyes of France and\r\n    the world, any share of the responsibility for the present\r\n    exaggerated armaments and expenses. They would be obliged to show\r\n    the French people and the German people too where the responsibility\r\n    really lay. The best course would be to avoid, by a confidential\r\n    arrangement for simultaneous action, the necessity of claiming\r\n    special praise for either party, or throwing special blame on\r\n    either. If this could not be, the next best thing would be that\r\n    Prussia should be prepared to receive, in a proper spirit, a\r\n    proposal from France, and the confidential steps you thought of\r\n    would, in his opinion, certainly be likely to effect so much at\r\n    least.\r\n\r\n    He spoke with great affection of the Emperor, and assured me that\r\n    H.M. acted in the most perfect harmony and confidence with his new\r\n    Ministers, and that no difficulty had arisen on any subject, though\r\n    the Ministers had maintained and were determined to maintain their\r\n    independence and their authority as the responsible Government of\r\n    the country.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity for Lord Clarendon's good offices presented itself very\r\nsoon; Count Bismarck had written a despatch to the Prussian Minister in\r\nLondon in which he alluded in complimentary terms to the friendly\r\ninterest which Lord Clarendon had always shown in the welfare of\r\nPrussia, and the latter made this an excuse for communicating his views\r\non disarmament, the method selected being a memorandum which Lord\r\nAugustus Loftus[15] was directed to bring to Bismarck's notice in strict\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nIn communicating to Lord Lyons a copy of this memorandum it is\r\ninstructive to learn that the British Cabinet Ministers, with one\r\nexception, were kept in ignorance of Lord Clarendon's action. 'I have,'\r\nhe wrote on February 3, 1870, 'only mentioned the matter to the Queen\r\nand Gladstone, both of whom highly approve. The Queen will be ready\r\nto write to the King of Prussia whenever I think her doing so may be\r\nuseful. You will be able to assure Daru that I have in no way\r\ncompromised the French Government.'\r\n\r\nThe memorandum which, it was faintly hoped, might impress the\r\nflinty-hearted Bismarck ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord A. Loftus._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, Feb. 2, 1870.\r\n\r\n    A few days ago, Count Bernstorff read to me a despatch from Count\r\n    Bismarck concerning the German Confederation which contained some\r\n    allusions to myself that gave me particular satisfaction, as a proof\r\n    that Count Bismarck recognized the sincerity of my interest in the\r\n    welfare and greatness of Germany.\r\n\r\n    If I am not mistaken in this I hope he will not think that I abuse\r\n    the confidence he seems disposed to place in me by asking him\r\n    privately through you to consider a subject that I have long had at\r\n    heart, and in making this request, it is, I am sure, unnecessary for\r\n    me to disclaim any intention to interfere in the internal affairs of\r\n    Prussia--such an intention would be alike presumptuous and useless.\r\n\r\n    But it is in the general interest of Europe, of peace, and of\r\n    humanity that I desire to invite the attention of Count Bismarck to\r\n    the enormous standing armies that now afflict Europe by constituting\r\n    a state of things that is neither peace nor war, but which is so\r\n    destructive of confidence that men almost desire war with all its\r\n    horrors in order to arrive at some certainty of peace--a state of\r\n    things that withdraws millions of hands from productive industry and\r\n    heavily taxes the people for their own injury and renders them\r\n    discontented with their rulers. It is a state of things in short\r\n    that no thoughtful man can contemplate without sorrow and alarm, for\r\n    this system is cruel, it is out of harmony with the civilization of\r\n    our age, and it is pregnant with danger.\r\n\r\n    To modify this system would be a glorious work, and it is one that\r\n    Prussia, better than any other Power, might undertake. She would not\r\n    only earn for herself the gratitude of Europe, but give a great\r\n    proof of her morality and her power; it would be a fitting\r\n    complement of the military successes she has achieved.\r\n\r\n    I know full well the difficulties that would beset such a course of\r\n    policy. I know how great and deserved is the King's parental feeling\r\n    and affection for his army--that he would view its reduction with\r\n    pain, and that he might not think it safe to diminish its numerical\r\n    force; but His Majesty is wise and foreseeing, and his moral courage\r\n    is always equal to the measures he believes to be right, and should\r\n    Count Bismarck think it not inconsistent with his duty to recommend\r\n    a partial disarmament to the King, I cannot but consider that the\r\n    moment is a singularly propitious one for the purpose.\r\n\r\n    The great standing army of France would of course come first under\r\n    the consideration of the King, but France has been never more\r\n    peacefully disposed than at the present time, under a responsible\r\n    Government which cannot make war 'for an idea,' because it\r\n    represents a nation that is determined to maintain peace so long as\r\n    there is no just cause for war, and because the Emperor entirely\r\n    shares the feelings of his people. I know that the present\r\n    Government of France will seek for popularity and power in a\r\n    peaceful policy and in economy, notwithstanding the vast and\r\n    increasing wealth of the country and the almost proverbial\r\n    indifference of the people to taxation.\r\n\r\n    There would consequently, I am convinced, be no opposition on the\r\n    part of the French Government to a reduction of the army _pari\r\n    passu_ with Prussia. For reasons, however, quite intelligible,\r\n    neither Government may choose to take the initiative in such a\r\n    proposal; but if I had authority to do so, I do not doubt that the\r\n    Queen would allow me to sound the ground at Paris, in a manner\r\n    entirely confidential, that should in no way compromise either\r\n    Government, whatever might be the result of the suggestion.\r\n\r\n    Pray read this letter to Count Bismarck with the sincere expression\r\n    of my esteem.\r\n\r\nWith all due respect to Lord Clarendon, this lecture (for that is what\r\nit amounted to) betrayed some want of appreciation of the real\r\nsituation, for he seems to have regarded the Prussian army as largely\r\nthe plaything of the King, and not to have fully realized the great\r\nobject for which it was intended. Were he alive at the present day his\r\nmoralizings on the iniquity of armaments would presumably be still more\r\ncondemnatory. Lord Lyons's comment on the communication was, that if the\r\nPrussians would not listen to Lord Clarendon, they would certainty not\r\nlisten to any one else, but he so little expected success that he\r\nregretted that the French Government had raised the question at all. If,\r\nhe pointed out, the Prussian Government would not agree to disarm, the\r\nnew French Ministers would be very angry and might turn round and say,\r\n'If you will not disarm, you must mean ill towards us, and we would\r\nrather fight it out at once, than ruin ourselves by keeping up, for an\r\nindefinite time, war establishments.' No doubt it would be an excellent\r\nthing if Prussia would take the opportunity of disarming while the\r\nFrench Government and the French nation were in the mood, for the happy\r\nmoment might pass away, and war might again be looked upon as a remedy,\r\nthough a desperate one, against socialism and revolution. Evidently he\r\nhad small belief in the efficacy of the step.\r\n\r\nThe forebodings entertained both by Lord Lyons and by Lord Clarendon\r\nhimself were very shortly realized. In a few days there arrived from\r\nLord Augustus Loftus a long letter reporting his conversation with\r\nBismarck, from which the following extracts are quoted:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord A. Loftus to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Berlin, Feb. 5, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I read your private and confidential letter to Count Bismarck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He first observed that he should wish to know what guarantee you\r\n    could give, or propose should be given, for the maintenance of\r\n    peace, or the security against danger. 'You,' he said, 'live in a\r\n    happy island and have not to fear an invasion. For 250 years Germany\r\n    has been exposed to and suffered French invasion; no one can accuse\r\n    us of being aggressive; Germany, as now constituted, has all that\r\n    she wants, and there is no object of conquest for her. But our\r\n    position,' he added, 'is an exceptional one. We are surrounded by\r\n    three great Empires with armies as large as our own, any two of whom\r\n    might coalesce against us.' He then reverted to March of last year.\r\n    He said that he was aware that at that moment, had it not been for\r\n    the influence of M. Rouher, an occupation of Belgium would have\r\n    taken place. Although there had been no direct understanding with\r\n    England, it was felt and known at Paris that Prussia would have\r\n    supported England, if action had been taken. It was this knowledge\r\n    that warded off action, and Belgium was saved. He had not at the\r\n    time mentioned the imminence of the danger to the King, for he was\r\n    afraid that His Majesty would have taken military measures which\r\n    would have rendered the situation more critical. He then observed\r\n    that in 1867 he had had a conversation of several hours with the\r\n    Emperor Napoleon. He had discussed with him the causes which had led\r\n    to the overthrow of Louis XVI., Charles X., and Louis Philippe--that\r\n    their fall was owing to want of energy and decision. He had told the\r\n    Emperor that, when he was travelling in dangerous company, the only\r\n    thing to do was to have a revolver in his pocket. The Emperor\r\n    had adopted this principle; he had the army with him, especially the\r\n    Guards; but Bismarck observed that lately one or two cases had\r\n    occurred which proved that the army was beginning to be tainted with\r\n    socialism. Bismarck said that the Emperor had had but two courses to\r\n    pursue; either to grant more internal liberty, or war; and the\r\n    Emperor had told him very clearly that if the one failed, there\r\n    could be no other alternative. 'Now,' said Bismarck, 'this danger\r\n    occurred only 10 months ago, and who can say that it may not occur\r\n    again?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He then went into an account of the hostility of the Muscovite party\r\n    towards Germany: of the dislike of the Czarewitch to everything\r\n    German, adding that whenever the Emperor Alexander dies, the\r\n    relations will undergo a great change.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He expressed a hope that you would say nothing at Paris on this\r\n    subject, as any refusal of Prussia to a proposal of disarmament\r\n    would make the position more dangerous.\r\n\r\n    He said that he did not dare even to name the subject of your letter\r\n    to the King, much less show it to His Majesty. He would get into a\r\n    fury and immediately think that England was trying to weaken Prussia\r\n    at the expense of France; nor was the present a judicious moment to\r\n    do so, for the King had only lately known what had taken place about\r\n    Belgium, and had in consequence expressed his cordial feelings\r\n    towards England. If the proposition came from France, the King would\r\n    view it as a ruse, but would not listen to it. Coming from England,\r\n    said Bismarck, it would make the worst impression on him.\r\n\r\n    I used all the arguments I could in support of your suggestion, and\r\n    read to him certain extracts from your other letter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    In conversation Bismarck remarked that Prussia might have acquired\r\n    South Germany without cost and risk, had she pleased to do so,\r\n    by which I understood him to refer to the cession of Belgium to\r\n    France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I left your letter marked 'confidential' in Bismarck's hands, as\r\n    I thought it essential that he should reflect over the powerful\r\n    arguments it contains, but he expressly declined to lay it before\r\n    the King. He will answer it through Count Bernstorff. It is evident\r\n    to me that there is not the smallest chance of inducing the King\r\n    to listen to a reduction of his army, and I must fear that any\r\n    proposals to him of this nature would only make him suspicious and\r\n    distrustful of England.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the view expressed in the last paragraph, it may fairly\r\nbe presumed that Bismarck's alleged fear of the King of Prussia was\r\na shameless fabrication. There is nothing whatever in subsequent\r\nrevelations to show that he stood in any awe of 'Most Gracious,' and the\r\nlatter appears to have always been a more or less passive instrument in\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nIn forwarding this correspondence to Lord Lyons, Lord Clarendon observed\r\nthat his suggestion appeared to have been a complete failure, and that\r\nBismarck was evidently just as hostile to the idea of disarmament as his\r\nroyal master. Lord Lyons was directed to communicate the substance of\r\nthe correspondence to Count Daru, but only in general terms, as when\r\nBismarck's answer arrived in London, fresh light might possibly be\r\nthrown upon the subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Feb. 11, 1870.\r\n\r\n    When I went to see Daru yesterday he opened the conversation by\r\n    telling me that he had received a letter from La Valette, from\r\n    which he learned that Count Bismarck had refused to consent to your\r\n    suggestion that Prussia should disarm. Three reasons were, Count\r\n    Daru said, given by Count Bismarck, none of which appeared to have\r\n    any weight.\r\n\r\n    The first was that he could not even mention the subject to the\r\n    King. This device had, Daru said, been resorted to by Count Bismarck\r\n    in the affair of Luxemburg; in fact, it seemed to be the usual mode\r\n    which the Count took of avoiding any discussion which he did not\r\n    like; it was however the duty of Ministers to bring wholesome\r\n    proposals before their Sovereign, whether the proposals were\r\n    palatable or not. In fact, Daru seemed to think that if Count\r\n    Bismarck himself desired to disarm, he would be able to obtain the\r\n    consent of the King.\r\n\r\n    The second argument was that the neighbours of Prussia need not be\r\n    uneasy at her military strength, because she was not a conquering\r\n    Power. This, Count Daru thought, might have been said with reason,\r\n    if Prussia had made no acquisition since 1815; but to say so now, he\r\n    declared, to be simply preposterous. Prussia had shown herself to be\r\n    a particularly ambitious Power, and her ambition had been already\r\n    extremely successful. For his own part, he rather admired than\r\n    blamed her desire to aggrandise herself, but he could not be\r\n    expected to listen seriously to an assertion that her power was no\r\n    cause of alarm because she was not a conquering nation.\r\n\r\n    Count Bismarck's third argument was that Prussia was not nearly so\r\n    ready for war as France--that, in fact, she had only 300,000 men\r\n    under arms, while France had upwards of 400,000. This, also, Count\r\n    Daru thought, simply ridiculous. Prussia could, he said, at any\r\n    moment, without an act of the Legislature, without a law, without\r\n    even a Royal Decree, by a simple order of the Minister of War, call\r\n    an immense force into the field, a force, too, of trained men, at a\r\n    moment's notice. There was nothing in France like this.\r\n\r\n    Daru went on to say that Count Bismarck's arguments did not at all\r\n    mend the matter. France must act as if Prussia had simply refused\r\n    to disarm. How was this state of things to be dealt with?\r\n\r\n    'I have determined,' said Daru, 'to disarm, whether Prussia does so\r\n    or not. In fact, I have resolved to ask the Emperor at once to\r\n    sanction a considerable reduction of the French army. I cannot make\r\n    this reduction as large as I should have done, if I had more\r\n    satisfactory accounts of the intentions of Prussia. All I can\r\n    propose, is to reduce the annual French contingent from 100,000 men\r\n    to 90,000. As our men serve nine years, this will eventually effect\r\n    a reduction of 90,000 men--a real absolute reduction. I shall thus\r\n    give a pledge to Europe of pacific intentions, and set a good\r\n    example to Prussia. I shall probably add great weight to the party\r\n    in Germany which demands to be relieved from military burdens, and,\r\n    I trust, enlist public opinion everywhere on my side. I shall also\r\n    furnish Lord Clarendon with a powerful argument, if, as I sincerely\r\n    hope, he will persevere in his endeavours to work upon Prussia. I\r\n    beg you to give my warmest thanks to him for what he has already\r\n    done, and to express to him my anxious hope that he will not\r\n    acquiesce in a first refusal from Prussia.'\r\n\r\n    Daru went on to say that it appeared that Count Bismarck had been so\r\n    little aware that your suggestion had been made in concert with\r\n    France that he had particularly requested that the French Government\r\n    might not be made acquainted with it. He begged me to express\r\n    particularly to you his gratitude for the care you had taken not to\r\n    compromise the French Government.\r\n\r\n    He concluded by saying that he could not at the moment say for\r\n    certain that the reduction would be made in the French army, because\r\n    the Emperor's sanction had not yet been given. He was afraid His\r\n    Majesty would not relish the proposal, but he felt confident that\r\n    His Majesty would accept the advice of his Ministers.\r\n\r\n    I told him that my personal opinion was that the best chance of\r\n    obtaining a disarmament in Prussia was to set a good example and\r\n    leave public opinion in Germany to work without foreign aid. Demands\r\n    from abroad for disarmament seemed to me likely to irritate the King\r\n    in Prussia, and to give him and the military party grounds for an\r\n    appeal to national patriotism against foreign dictation. I thought\r\n    that the effect of the disarmament of France in strengthening the\r\n    feeling in Germany against military burdens would be very great if\r\n    it were not counteracted by appeals which might wound German\r\n    susceptibilities.\r\n\r\n    Daru seemed to agree generally with me, but not to be willing to say\r\n    anything which would pledge him to abstain from calling officially\r\n    upon Prussia to disarm, if it suited the home policy of the Ministry\r\n    to do so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Feb. 12, 1870.\r\n\r\n    Daru seems to have taken Bismarck's refusal better than I expected.\r\n    We have not, however, got the definitive answer which is to come\r\n    through Bernstorff, and as Bismarck kept a copy of my letter I have\r\n    little doubt that he will show it to the King, though he pretended\r\n    to be afraid of doing so.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Count Daru may be sure that I shall not let the subject drop, though\r\n    I shall wish to proceed in it as I think most prudent. I have only\r\n    mentioned it to Gladstone among my colleagues, and of course, to the\r\n    Queen, who takes the warmest interest in the matter. I had a letter\r\n    from her yesterday, expressing a hope that the French Government\r\n    would not at present make any official _démarches re_ disarmament,\r\n    as she is sure, from her knowledge of the King's character, that it\r\n    would do more harm than good. I am quite of the same opinion and\r\n    think it would arouse German susceptibility, which is quite as great\r\n    as the French, whereas we want to make German opinion act in our\r\n    behalf.\r\n\r\n    Nothing is more likely to bring over Germany than France partially\r\n    disarming without reference to Prussia, and I sincerely hope that\r\n    this project of Daru's will be carried out. The Germans will be\r\n    flattered by it as a proof of confidence, and it will furnish them\r\n    with a fresh weapon against their war Budget.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon's statement that he meant to persevere in his efforts\r\nafforded much gratification to Count Daru. With regard to Lord\r\nClarendon's desire that the matter should be kept as secret as possible,\r\nhe explained that he had confined the knowledge of it as much as\r\npossible to himself, Lord Lyons and La Valette, but that of course he\r\nhad been obliged to mention it to the Emperor and to Ollivier, and he\r\n'seemed to be rather afraid that neither of these important persons\r\nwould be perfectly secret.'[16]\r\n\r\nBismarck's reply to Lord Clarendon did not afford much ground for hope.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, Feb. 19, 1870.\r\n\r\n    The day before yesterday, Bernstorff brought me Bismarck's answer to\r\n    my letter, and I enclose a translation.\r\n\r\n    It is courteous, but the intention not to disarm is manifest. I have\r\n    been detained so late at the Cabinet that I cannot write a letter\r\n    for you to read to Daru, so I have marked Bismarck's letter, and you\r\n    can extract the passages in the shape of a memorandum which you can\r\n    leave with Daru in the strictest confidence. I should much like to\r\n    hear what he will think of it, in order to shape my reply.\r\n\r\n    Bernstorff, who evidently spoke from a private letter of Bismarck's\r\n    that he did not show me, laid much stress upon the active ill-will\r\n    of Russia whenever the present Czar is gathered to his fathers--the\r\n    present Cesarewitch and the Slav races are very hostile to\r\n    Germany--(I believe this is true), and this hostility would be\r\n    encouraged, according to Bismarck, if German means of resistance\r\n    were weakened, it would invite coalition, under circumstances easily\r\n    imaginable, between Austria, Russia, and France against\r\n    Prussia--hypothetical cases of this kind are easily invented to\r\n    support foregone conclusions, but there is a _sort_ of opening as to\r\n    a conference between Powers as to proportionate reductions and\r\n    exchange of guarantees. I don't mean to lay much stress on this, nor\r\n    should I think that it would be productive of a practical result,\r\n    but you might allude to it as a sign that the negation is not\r\n    absolute.\r\n\r\n    Pray, however, lose no time in correcting the error into which Daru\r\n    has been led by La Valette as to an official despatch or a speech in\r\n    Parliament from me. I cannot conceive how he made such a mistake,\r\n    for I said nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\nBismarck's answer was of considerable length, and is quoted in full\r\nbecause it is a document of historical interest. It will be observed\r\nthat it was in the main an amplification of the views expressed verbally\r\nto Lord Augustus Loftus a fortnight earlier, and that it contained\r\nspecious arguments designed to impress upon Lord Clarendon the entirely\r\nunaggressive nature of Prussian policy. The belief, however, of Lord\r\nClarendon and of the French Ministers, that Bismarck entertained no\r\nsuspicion as to how the proposal originated, implies a simplicity on\r\ntheir part which he must have thoroughly enjoyed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Count Bismarck to Count Bernstorff._\r\n\r\n    [_Translation._]                   Berlin, Feb. 9, 1870.\r\n\r\n    Lord Augustus Loftus has read to me a private letter addressed to\r\n    him by Lord Clarendon on the 2nd Inst. Its object is to discuss with\r\n    me in a manner strictly private and confidential a plan for the\r\n    partial disarmament of the Continental Powers. After a few friendly\r\n    expressions concerning myself, which I cordially reciprocate, the\r\n    English Statesman proceeds to enlarge upon the hardships and burdens\r\n    imposed on the Nations of Europe by their excessive armaments;--He\r\n    conceives that it would be much to Prussia's credit and well worthy\r\n    of her great military renown if she were to co-operate in\r\n    endeavouring to alleviate those burdens; he thinks that the King our\r\n    August Master, sincerely attached as he is to his army, would not\r\n    shrink from the adoption of such a measure, provided he were\r\n    convinced of its justice;--he deems the present moment peculiarly\r\n    fitted for making this overture, on account of the peaceful\r\n    disposition of all the Powers and more especially of the Emperor\r\n    Napoleon and of his present Government; and he states his readiness,\r\n    provided he can count on our friendly assistance, to sound the\r\n    Emperor and his Government with a view to eventually opening\r\n    negotiations on the subject.\r\n\r\n    The English Ambassador has doubtless sent home a report of the\r\n    Verbal answers which I gave to the above communication.--In order,\r\n    however, to meet the confidence reposed in me by Lord Clarendon in\r\n    a similar spirit, I feel called upon to address you in a manner\r\n    equally confidential, and one which for that very reason admits of\r\n    my speaking with the utmost frankness.\r\n\r\n    Lord Clarendon cannot doubt, as indeed the opening observations in\r\n    his letter plainly shew, that I render full justice to the friendly\r\n    feelings and intentions which he entertains towards Prussia and the\r\n    North German Confederation.\r\n\r\n    I am convinced that no European State or Statesman exists who does\r\n    not wish to see the feeling of confidence strengthened and Peace\r\n    maintained; and further that no German Government would wish to\r\n    impose upon its people the maintenance of an army in excess of that\r\n    proportion for which the requirements of its safety imperatively\r\n    call.\r\n\r\n    Were the question officially put to us whether the diminution of our\r\n    military strength is compatible with the secure maintenance of our\r\n    independence, we should not decline to share in any deliberations\r\n    which might take place on the subject; and we should carefully sift\r\n    the question whether the great neighbouring Military Powers are\r\n    willing or able to give us guarantees such as would compensate\r\n    Germany for the decrease in the amount of Security which She has\r\n    hitherto owed to her armies.\r\n\r\n    Lord Clarendon does His Majesty the King full justice when he infers\r\n    that no considerations or feelings of a purely personal nature would\r\n    deter him from adopting a measure which he had once recognized as\r\n    right and proper, but Lord Clarendon will as readily understand that\r\n    however willing we may be to enter into a strictly confidential\r\n    interchange of ideas on this important question, we must reserve to\r\n    ourselves the Right of making a careful estimate of the relative\r\n    position of the Parties most deeply interested in the matter, and of\r\n    judging whether the concessions which we ourselves might probably be\r\n    expected to make stand in a fair and just proportion to those which\r\n    it would be in the power of other Nations to make. Our very\r\n    geographical position is itself wholly different from that of any\r\n    other Continental Power, and does not of course admit of comparison\r\n    with the insular position of Great Britain. We are environed on all\r\n    sides by neighbours whose military strength is of such a nature as\r\n    to form an important element in all political combinations. Each of\r\n    the other three great Continental Powers is on the contrary so\r\n    placed that at least on one of its frontiers it is not open to a\r\n    serious attack, and France is so situated as to be practically\r\n    secure from danger on three sides. These three Powers have of late\r\n    years considerably increased their military strength and have done\r\n    so in a proportion in excess of our own:--Austria and France have\r\n    remodelled wholly their military systems, so as to be able to assail\r\n    us at any moment with increased forces. The armies of Austria,\r\n    France and Russia, have each an army which, when on a Peace footing,\r\n    is superior in numbers to our own. Our system is moreover so to\r\n    speak so thoroughly transparent, that any increase in our effective\r\n    force can at once be appreciated; the amount of any addition or\r\n    decrease which we may make in our military force can therefore be\r\n    most accurately calculated.\r\n\r\n    The military systems of other Nations are of a different nature.\r\n    Even in the case of nominal Reductions they admit of the maintenance\r\n    or renewal of their full effective strength; they even admit of a\r\n    material increase of force being made without attracting notice or\r\n    at all events without entailing the possibility of proof.--With us\r\n    on the other hand, the whole military system, which from its very\r\n    nature is a matter of publicity, becomes more so owing to the nature\r\n    of our Institutions.\r\n\r\n    Under these circumstances, and in the event of a discussion on\r\n    measures of such great importance being actually opened, we must ask\r\n    ourselves what guarantees can be given to us that our Position as\r\n    regards other Powers will not be practically impaired by our\r\n    signifying our adherence to a system, which however just and\r\n    even-handed it might appear in its action, would in reality not deal\r\n    with equal fairness with all the Parties concerned.\r\n\r\n    Any weakening of Prussia's Power, any disturbance of the balance of\r\n    Power in Europe, can hardly be for the interest of England. It must\r\n    be acknowledged that whilst, on the one hand, the state of\r\n    preparation for War of the Great Powers gives rise to apprehension,\r\n    as set forth in Lord Clarendon's letter, still that very state of\r\n    preparation may on the other prove a practical guarantee that any\r\n    attempt to assail or to disturb existing Rights will be firmly and\r\n    effectively met.\r\n\r\n    Of this I conceive that the past year has afforded fresh proofs, and\r\n    Lord Clarendon, intimately acquainted as he is with the Events of\r\n    that Period, will be best able to judge of the truth of my Remark.\r\n\r\n    The maintenance of Peace has not been due merely and solely to\r\n    pacific views entertained by Rulers personally, for the Power and\r\n    readiness of neighbouring states has had great weight in affecting\r\n    opinion and in determining Resolutions. The Inclinations of a Nation\r\n    may be essentially peaceful, they may rest on a keen appreciation of\r\n    its own interests, but they are nevertheless liable to be suddenly\r\n    changed either by some unforeseen accident, or by fictitious\r\n    agitation. Under such circumstances, neither the most powerful\r\n    Monarch, nor the most influential Minister is able to estimate or to\r\n    guarantee the duration of peaceful Inclinations.\r\n\r\n    I am persuaded that when you submit these Remarks for Lord Clarendon's\r\n    consideration, he will not see in them a Refusal to enter into the\r\n    Views which he has so happily and eloquently set forth, but rather\r\n    as the expression of the very serious responsibility which rests\r\n    with a Minister who is called upon to advise his Sovereign in a\r\n    matter pregnant with such important consequences.\r\n\r\n    I can of course have no objection to your reading this letter to\r\n    Lord Clarendon, I must however ask you to make the communication in\r\n    the strictest confidence, in accordance with the character of\r\n    thorough privacy with which Lord Clarendon, with Great Tact and to\r\n    my entire Satisfaction, has invested the matter.\r\n\r\nBismarck's views, as set forth above, were communicated by Lord Lyons to\r\nCount Daru on February 22, and the latter remarked that, upon the whole,\r\nmatters were rather better than he expected, as there was no categorical\r\nrefusal to consider the question of disarmament. In his opinion, that\r\nquestion was a very simple one. The military forces of the great\r\nContinental Powers bore a certain proportion to each other; in order to\r\nmaintain that proportion, very heavy burdens were imposed upon each\r\ncountry, but if, by common agreement, each reduced its army by a certain\r\nnumber of men, the same proportion would be preserved, while the burdens\r\nwere alleviated. If, however, a minute discussion of guarantees and\r\nsecurities were began, very awkward topics might be brought forward. For\r\ninstance, the right of Prussia to garrison Mayence, was, to say the\r\nleast, doubtful, and the fortifications she was erecting on the North\r\nSea might give rise to comment. At this stage of the conversation, Lord\r\nLyons hastily intervened in order to point out the extreme disadvantage\r\nof mixing up Mayence and the North Sea with the question of disarmament,\r\nand Count Daru concluded by saying that he was quite content to leave\r\nthe matter entirely in the hands of Lord Clarendon, as nobody else could\r\nmanage it so well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, March 12, 1870.\r\n\r\n    Outsiders are not always good judges, but it seems to me that\r\n    Ollivier makes enemies unnecessarily and gives certain pretexts to\r\n    the Imperialists, who of course work on the Emperor's mind against\r\n    his Government. I fear there will be a split one of these days.\r\n\r\n    I agree with you that Prussia will never declare that she will not\r\n    complete the unity of Germany, because she looks upon it as\r\n    inevitable. Nothing, as the King himself said to me, can prevent the\r\n    gravitation of the weak towards the strong, but that it would not\r\n    take place in his life, possibly not in that of his son.\r\n\r\n    France, if not grown wiser by that time, will probably consider it a\r\n    _casus belli_, but I don't see that it would make much difference\r\n    to her, as the whole military force of the South is now actually at\r\n    the disposal of the Confederation, and she would weld all Germany\r\n    together as one man if she attempted by force to prevent Bavaria,\r\n    Würtemberg, and Baden from joining the North, when they had\r\n    determined that it was for their own interest to do so.\r\n\r\n    I have fired another shot at Bismarck about disarmament, but I don't\r\n    expect better success from it than from the first. The King of\r\n    Prussia, a little time ago, told the Duke of Oldenburg, who pressed\r\n    him on the subject, that he would disarm if other Powers did the\r\n    same, so he is not so completely unapproachable as Bismarck would\r\n    lead us to suppose.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon's second attempt upon Bismarck was made on March 9, and\r\ntook the form of a lengthy letter to Lord Augustus Loftus, in which the\r\narguments in favour of disarmament were reiterated and endeavours made\r\nto convince Bismarck that Prussia had really no cause for uneasiness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord A. Loftus._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, March 9, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I have delayed writing to request that you would convey to Count\r\n    Bismarck my cordial thanks for the courtesy and frankness with which\r\n    in a private letter dated Feb. 9th, he answered my letter to you on\r\n    the subject of partial disarmament.\r\n\r\n    The delay has been occasioned by my endeavours to ascertain\r\n    correctly the relative forces of the great military Powers, and I\r\n    hope that Count Bismarck will not consider that I trespass unduly on\r\n    his time and his confidence if I again revert to a subject which\r\n    more than any other I have at heart, and which an English Minister\r\n    may have some claim to discuss without suspicion of his motives,\r\n    because England is not a military Power, but is deeply interested in\r\n    the maintenance of peace, and the progress and prosperity of the\r\n    Continent.\r\n\r\n    I am as convinced as Count Bismarck himself can be that no German\r\n    Government would wish to impose upon its people the maintenance of\r\n    an army in excess of that proportion for which the requirements of\r\n    its safety imperatively call, and I would not desire the reduction\r\n    of a single regiment if I thought it would impair the independence\r\n    and the honour of Prussia, which in their plenitude I regard as\r\n    essentially beneficial to Europe.\r\n\r\n    But can it be honestly affirmed that the power and independence of\r\n    Prussia are menaced from any quarter? and, if not, surely the\r\n    military force of Prussia is excessive and entails upon other\r\n    countries the unquestionable evil of maintaining armies beyond the\r\n    requirements of their safety.\r\n\r\n    The only countries from which, owing to geographical position,\r\n    Prussia could anticipate danger are Russia, Austria, and France, and\r\n    can it be said that from either there is any real cause for\r\n    apprehension? In the conversation I had with Count Bernstorff,\r\n    when he communicated to me the letter of Count Bismarck, he dwelt at\r\n    some length upon the ill-will of Russia towards Germany, which might\r\n    take an active form on the death of the present Emperor, and for\r\n    which Prussia ought to be prepared, but Count Bismarck must know\r\n    better than myself that Russia has long since, and wisely, ceased to\r\n    aim at influence in Germany or intervention in German affairs, and\r\n    that all her energies are now directed eastwards with a view of\r\n    extending her territory and her commerce in Asia. Whatever\r\n    sentiments may be suggested in other quarters by a rapid development\r\n    of the present policy of Russia which has the entire support of\r\n    public opinion in that country, it appears certain that Germany can\r\n    have no danger to guard against from Russia, whatever may be the\r\n    personal feelings or opinions of the reigning sovereign.\r\n\r\n    On paper, and only on paper, Austria has an army of 800,000, but she\r\n    could not, even on the most pressing emergency, bring 200,000 men\r\n    into the field. Her finances are dilapidated and her internal\r\n    disorganization affords just cause of alarm. Danger to Prussia from\r\n    Austria must, for many years to come, be a chimera.\r\n\r\n    The military peace establishment of France is nominally greater than\r\n    that of Prussia; the former being 400,000 and the latter being\r\n    300,000; but the number of troops stationed in the costly and\r\n    unproductive colony of Algiers is not, and cannot ever be less than\r\n    60,000 men; other colonial possessions require military protection,\r\n    and as the garrisons in Lyons and other great towns necessary for\r\n    the maintenance of order are not less than 40,000 men, the\r\n    establishments of the two countries are as nearly as possible upon\r\n    an equality. Can this state of things be regarded as a menace or a\r\n    danger to Prussia? I am greatly mistaken if any Prussian statesman\r\n    or General would reply to this inquiry in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n    The question then to my mind appears quite simple. The military\r\n    forces of the great Continental Powers have a certain proportion to\r\n    each other; in order to maintain that proportion, very heavy burdens\r\n    are imposed upon each country, but if by common agreement, each\r\n    reduces its army by a certain number of men, the same proportions\r\n    will be maintained, while the burdens, which are fast becoming\r\n    intolerable will be alleviated.\r\n\r\n    Count Bismarck however thinks that if the question of diminishing\r\n    the military strength of Prussia is entertained, it will be\r\n    necessary carefully to inquire what guarantees can be given by\r\n    neighbouring Military Powers in compensation to Germany for a\r\n    decrease in the amount of security which she has hitherto owed to\r\n    her armies.\r\n\r\n    Upon this I would respectfully beg to observe that a minute\r\n    discussion of guarantees would be endless and dangerous. The\r\n    legitimate rights and precautionary measures of independent\r\n    Governments would be analysed in a spirit possibly of unfriendly\r\n    criticism, and if agreements were arrived at, constant vigilance\r\n    over their faithful fulfilment would be necessary, and this might\r\n    possibly give rise to the quarrels that the agreements were intended\r\n    to avert, and which would at once put an end to the compacts.\r\n\r\n    It is upon a dispassionate consideration of the probable course of\r\n    events that the question of partial disarmament should in my opinion\r\n    be decided, and in France (the only country with which we need\r\n    concern ourselves) what do we find? A nation resolutely pacific: a\r\n    Government depending on popular support and therefore equally\r\n    pacific: a responsible Minister declaring that France will not\r\n    interfere with the affairs of her neighbours, and the Sovereign\r\n    willingly assenting to a diminution of one-tenth of the annual\r\n    conscription without asking for reciprocity on the part of Germany,\r\n    and thereby showing his confidence in the King's declaration.\r\n\r\n    I venture to think that the present state of opinion in France,\r\n    founded as it is upon a true estimate of French interests, is a more\r\n    solid guarantee than any that the respective governments of France\r\n    and Germany could effect for their own security.\r\n\r\n    Count Bismarck will admit, and I am sure that a statesman so liberal\r\n    and far-sighted will admit without regret, that the people\r\n    everywhere are claiming and must obtain a larger share in the\r\n    administration of their own affairs, and that, in proportion\r\n    as they do so, the chances of causeless wars will diminish. The\r\n    people well understand the horrors of war, and that they, and not\r\n    their rulers, are the real sufferers: they equally understand and\r\n    will daily become more impatient of the taxation for those costly\r\n    preparations for war which in themselves endanger peace, and I\r\n    believe that there is at this moment no surer road to solid\r\n    popularity for Government than attending to the wants and wishes of\r\n    the people on the subject of armaments.\r\n\r\n    I have reason to know that the reduction in the French army would\r\n    have been carried further if the Government could have hoped that\r\n    the example would be followed by Prussia. Sooner or later, however,\r\n    this reason will be publicly assigned, and then upon Prussia will\r\n    rest the responsibility not only of maintaining so large a force\r\n    herself, but of compelling other countries reluctantly to do the\r\n    same.\r\n\r\n    It would be to me a matter of most sincere pleasure to think that no\r\n    such responsibility will rest on Prussia, but I should hardly have\r\n    presumed to recur to the subject if I had not gathered from the\r\n    patriotic letter of Count Bismarck that further discussion was not\r\n    absolutely precluded, and I had not therefore been encouraged to\r\n    hope that he might think it proper to make my suggestions known to\r\n    his Sovereign.\r\n\r\nBismarck's reply to this exhortation was equally long, and contained\r\nsome arguments of such a puerile nature that it can hardly be believed\r\nthat he expected them to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord A. Loftus to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Berlin, March 12, 1870.\r\n\r\n    On the receipt of your private letter yesterday morning, I asked for\r\n    an interview with Count Bismarck, and he received me last evening.\r\n\r\n    I first observed that you would have hardly ventured to recur to the\r\n    subject of disarmament, had you not thought that his letter to Count\r\n    Bernstorff abstained from putting a veto on discussion, and from a\r\n    feeling that the King of Prussia would reap general esteem and\r\n    admiration in Europe by giving a patent proof of his Peace Policy,\r\n    whilst on the contrary, His Majesty might incur unpopularity if the\r\n    French should be enabled to say that they were compelled by Prussia\r\n    to keep up an armament against which the Nation is disposed to\r\n    protest.--I then read your letter to Count Bismarck. He listened\r\n    with great attention, merely making two observations during my\r\n    reading--\r\n\r\n    1st. That France had only 40,000 men in Algeria, and 2nd that the\r\n    Constitutional Government in France was only of three months'\r\n    existence, and therefore its stability could not be yet said to be\r\n    ensured. When I had finished, Count Bismarck stated that, as far as\r\n    France alone was concerned, Prussia and the North German\r\n    Confederation might not feel themselves endangered by a diminution\r\n    of the Army, but he said Austria and France might join together and\r\n    even the 250,000 men which you give to Austria might in conjunction\r\n    with France prove to be a serious embarrassment to Prussia. The\r\n    20,000 men which might perhaps be dispensed with, would then be just\r\n    the balance which might turn the Scale against Prussia.\r\n\r\n    He then reverted to France. He said although the Nation was now\r\n    pacific, you know as well as I do that a war cry may be raised in\r\n    France, on any emergency, and at the shortest notice.\r\n\r\n    If, said Count Bismarck, the present Constitutional Government had\r\n    been three years instead of three months in existence, then there\r\n    would be some chance for its duration and for the maintenance of\r\n    Peace. At the present moment, he observed, there was a party anxious\r\n    to restore the former state of things, a personal Government.\r\n    Amongst that Party, there was the Empress Eugénie, and they would\r\n    not be sorry to divert the public attention from home affairs by\r\n    raising some question of Foreign Policy.\r\n\r\n    He said that the Provincial Press of France (and he reviewed\r\n    articles from all the Small Provincial Papers) teemed with abuse\r\n    against Prussia.\r\n\r\n    There were other indications in Europe which did not leave him without\r\n    some disquietude for the maintenance of Peace.\r\n\r\n    He first alluded to the local provincial Press in France as\r\n    continually preaching antagonism to Prussia, then to certain reports\r\n    which had reached him of the purchase of horses in France, but to\r\n    these he did not attach much importance. He then referred to reports\r\n    he had received from the Prussian Minister at Copenhagen, who\r\n    observed, that if any State of larger dimensions were to do what\r\n    Denmark was now doing, some sinister design would evidently be\r\n    attributed to it.\r\n\r\n    He considered the appointment of Monsignor Klazko by Count Beust to\r\n    a post in the Foreign Office at Vienna as significative of the\r\n    intentions of Austria, and he observed that Count Beust was\r\n    intriguing with the Polish Party for some object which was not clear\r\n    to him. He then referred to Southern Germany and to the intrigues of\r\n    the Ultra-Montaine party, and cited a saying of the late Prince\r\n    Schwarzenberg 'that the three Empires (France, Austria, and Prussia)\r\n    should unite against the Heretics in Europe.'\r\n\r\n    To these observations I replied that the Safety of Prussia was\r\n    secured by her Military system which supplied necessary reserves and\r\n    Landwehr, without the incubus of such an enormous standing army, and\r\n    that Prussia was therefore in a position to be able to give an\r\n    example to Europe.\r\n\r\n    On the whole, although Count Bismarck appeared to be somewhat\r\n    incredulous as to the pacific appearance of Europe, he was less\r\n    decidedly opposed to any disarmament than on the last occasions I\r\n    spoke to him. He asked whether it was desired that he should mention\r\n    the subject to the King. I replied in the affirmative, and suggested\r\n    that he should have your Lordship's two letters translated and\r\n    submitted to His Majesty.\r\n\r\n    On my mentioning that any attempt at mutual guarantees would be very\r\n    unadvisable, he said that without some guarantee the question of\r\n    entertaining disarmament would be difficult; but he said it more as\r\n    a passing observation than as a fixed decision.\r\n\r\n    I am afraid that if the question of disarmament is entertained at\r\n    all (and probably neither the King nor Count Bismarck will like to\r\n    discard it entirely) it will be hedged round with so many\r\n    conditions, that it will be rendered impossible; great care will be\r\n    required that the question of disarmament shall not become a\r\n    question of Contention, and thus give a pretext for discussion, to\r\n    be followed perhaps by war.\r\n\r\n    I asked Count Bismarck casually what foundation there was for the\r\n    repeatedly recurring reports of General Fleury's attempts to bring\r\n    about a Russo-French Alliance.\r\n\r\n    Count Bismarck said that General Fleury on his arrival had acted\r\n    without instructions, and he attributed no importance to these\r\n    reports.\r\n\r\n    He said that at first the Emperor of Russia had rather been taken\r\n    in, and that he had written a letter to the King of Prussia (he did\r\n    not say on what subject), but that the King of Prussia had replied\r\n    in a manner most satisfactory and agreeable to the Emperor, and that\r\n    it was then that the Emperor of Russia sent the St. George to the\r\n    King of Prussia.\r\n\r\n    I could see that Count Bismarck has no fear of the Russian policy\r\n    towards Prussia, so long as the Emperor lives and that Prince\r\n    Gortchakow remains Minister.\r\n\r\n    I shall see Bismarck later, and will then inform you what view the\r\n    King takes of the proposal for disarmament.\r\n\r\nThis unpromising communication was transmitted to Paris, and Lord\r\nClarendon comforted himself with the thought that there was still a ray\r\nof hope, as Bismarck had promised to bring the matter before the King,\r\nand there might therefore be an opportunity of recurring to it later on.\r\nDaru, too, did not look upon the position as hopeless.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 17, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I read to Count Daru this afternoon a memorandum giving a short\r\n    summary of the principal points in Lord A. Loftus's letter to you of\r\n    the 12th about disarmament.\r\n\r\n    He said that on the whole the impression made on his mind was good.\r\n    There was more disposition to consider the subject, and Count\r\n    Bismarck seemed rather to have sought to find something to say\r\n    against disarmament, than to have alleged reason which could be\r\n    supposed to have any real weight with him.\r\n\r\n    At all events, Count Bismarck mistook the state of France. The\r\n    people were honestly and sincerely pacific, and the Constitutional\r\n    system might be considered as firmly established. He would not deny\r\n    that the French were a proud and susceptible people, and that they\r\n    could be roused to war by their Government, if their honour or their\r\n    patriotism were appealed to. But the present Government were as\r\n    pacific as the people, and they had the full confidence of the\r\n    Emperor and the nation--of the nation, he said, not of the Corps\r\n    Législatif, whose support was not cordial--nor of the Senate, which\r\n    did not like them--nor of the countries, who hated them. Count\r\n    Bismarck would see in a few days, a series of measures which would\r\n    convince him that Constitutional Government was irrevocably\r\n    established in France. The Ministers had obtained, or were on the\r\n    point of obtaining, His Majesty's sanction to reforms which would\r\n    convince all the world that the Emperor had not only landed on the\r\n    shore of Parliamentary Government, but had burnt his ships behind him.\r\n\r\n    As to Count Bismarck's argument that Prussia must be prepared to\r\n    face the united armies of France and Austria, Count Daru remarked\r\n    that it was preposterous to maintain that any one Power of Europe\r\n    must endeavour to be a match for all the rest united. If Austria\r\n    united with France, Prussia might find allies also. It was not to be\r\n    supposed that all Europe would stand by and look on at a fight with\r\n    France and Austria on one side and Prussia on the other.\r\n\r\n    Finally, he repeated that on the whole, Count Bismarck's language\r\n    was more satisfactory than it had yet been.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion to be drawn from this conversation is that Count Daru\r\nmust have been more easy to please than most people; but all hopes\r\nwere shortly dashed to the ground when a letter arrived from Lord\r\nAugustus Loftus reporting the result of his further communications with\r\nBismarck.\r\n\r\nBismarck stated that Lord Clarendon's letters had been translated and\r\nlaid before the King, and that the proposal had not been favourably\r\nentertained by His Majesty. There were only two methods of reducing the\r\nGerman Army, one to change the present legislative enactments, and\r\nthereby the whole military system; the other, to reduce the term of\r\nmilitary service to two and a half years. The first was considered to be\r\nimpossible, and, as for the second, the King had resisted Parliament on\r\nthe subject for five years, and now declared that he would rather give\r\nup his throne than yield. Further, the King viewed the proposal as being\r\nput forward in favour of France and French policy, and without regard to\r\nthe safety of Prussia. To use Bismarck's own expression: 'It was the act\r\nof a _cool friend_.' 'It is all very well for you,' said Bismarck,\r\n'living in an island, where no one can attack you, to preach\r\ndisarmaments, but put yourselves into our skin. You would then think and\r\nact differently. What would you say if we were to observe to you that\r\nyour navy was too large, that you did not require so many ironclads,\r\nthat you lavished too large a portion of the taxation of the country in\r\nbuilding ships, which in the peaceful disposition of Europe were not\r\nrequired? If we recommended you to diminish your naval armament?'\r\n\r\nTo this home-thrust the Ambassador made the somewhat unconvincing reply\r\nthat as evidence of our pacific disposition we had just sold an ironclad\r\nto the Prussian Government, and were ready to sell others--a reply\r\nwhich was received with irreverent merriment; neither do the imposing\r\nsentiments expressed respecting the general happiness and prosperity of\r\nEurope seem to have made much impression upon the man of blood and iron.\r\nThe utmost that could be obtained from him was a vague statement that\r\nthe whole question would be discussed by the Parliament 'in a year or\r\nso,' and that a decision must then be taken as to what was required for\r\nthe safety of the country. 'I saw,' wrote the Minister sadly, 'that it\r\nwas useless to pursue the question further.' Lord Clarendon realized\r\nthat the game was up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, March 23, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I send you a copy of Loftus's letter, and you will, I am sure, agree\r\n    with me that more harm than good would be done by further pressing\r\n    the question of disarmament, after the very decided expression of\r\n    the King's opinion. You can tell Daru in mild terms the two\r\n    objections raised by His Majesty and that, on the whole, I consider\r\n    it better to wait and not to show much anxiety until the War Budget\r\n    comes to be discussed next year, when the example of France, as\r\n    regards military reductions, the pacific temper of her people, and\r\n    the consolidation of her institutions, cannot fail to have a\r\n    beneficial effect on the Federal Parliament. At present, it seems\r\n    that the Liberal party, upon which Bismarck must lean more and more,\r\n    would only support reduction on the condition that he would change\r\n    his policy and invite, or coerce the South into the Confederation.\r\n    Bismarck on this subject has behaved with prudence, at the expense\r\n    of popularity, as regards Baden (the sorest point with the French),\r\n    and he should not be pressed into a course he dislikes or thinks\r\n    dangerous to the continuance of good relations with France. He is\r\n    foolish about the press and always irritated by articles, however\r\n    worthless, against Prussia, which he usually thinks are written by\r\n    authority, or are the true manifestation of public opinion in the\r\n    particular country.\r\n\r\n    You will observe that the King thinks I have been acting in the\r\n    interest of France, and it is therefore not only on public grounds,\r\n    but as regards myself personally, that I am very desirous that the\r\n    most complete secrecy should be observed respecting the whole of\r\n    these unsuccessful negotiations, if they can be so called. I know\r\n    well the suspicious character of the King, and if he thought that we\r\n    had cast in our lot completely with France, he would straightway set\r\n    about a more intimate alliance with Russia which would not be for\r\n    the interest either of England or France.\r\n\r\n    Pray therefore impress upon Daru the necessity of complete\r\n    discretion.\r\n\r\nThus ended an attempt in the success of which no one probably felt much\r\nconfidence. Various conclusions may be drawn from the correspondence\r\nquoted above. There seems to have been no doubt that the French\r\nGovernment (whatever may have been the sentiments of the Emperor) was\r\nsincerely anxious for a partial disarmament and the promised reduction\r\nof the annual contingent by 10,000 men was evidence of good intentions.\r\nThere was, however, an essential difference between the French and\r\nPrussian view as to what constituted conquest and aggression which in\r\nreality precluded any real settlement.\r\n\r\nPrussia held that it was not conquest or aggression to annex any German\r\nStates, while France considered that the annexation of any States south\r\nof the Maine would be as much conquest or aggression on the part of\r\nPrussia, as it would be, on the part of France, to annex them herself.\r\nPrussia refused to declare that she would not complete the unity of\r\nGermany. France, on her side, refused to declare that she would not\r\ninterfere to prevent it.\r\n\r\nAs for Bismarck's arguments against disarmament, some of them were\r\npositively grotesque, and it must have required more than ordinary\r\nassurance to contend, for instance, that Denmark and Monsignor Klazko\r\nconstituted a menace to Prussia, whilst the artifice of representing the\r\nKing as a sort of uncontrollable despot was too thin to deceive any one\r\nof ordinary intelligence. On the other hand, Bismarck seems to have\r\ndisplayed commendable patience and restraint when lectured on the\r\niniquity of the Prussian military system. Lord Clarendon's language\r\nrather conveyed the impression that England stood upon a moral pinnacle\r\nwhich entitled her to admonish other nations as to the errors of their\r\nways, but the claim was vitiated by the fact that she maintained, and\r\nintended to maintain, a navy of overwhelming strength, while if her\r\nmilitary power was even more insignificant than it is at the present\r\nday, the cost of the British Army amounted to much more than that of the\r\nPrussian Army, and therefore the less said about unproductive\r\nexpenditure the better. If, in fact, the respective expenditure of the\r\ntwo countries upon armaments is borne in mind it seems almost incredible\r\nthat Lord Clarendon should have ventured to preach economy to the\r\nPrussian Government. During the previous year, the total British\r\nexpenditure upon armaments amounted to no less than twenty-four millions\r\nand a quarter. Of this sum, rather more than fourteen millions were\r\nallotted to the Army, and nearly ten millions to the Navy. Now the total\r\nmilitary and naval expenditure of the North German Federation at the\r\nsame period only amounted to ten millions eight hundred thousand pounds,\r\nand the Prussian contribution towards the total represented a little\r\nover seven millions. It might also be added that England was quite ready\r\nat all times to supply to an unlimited amount, ironclads, rifles and\r\nmunition of war to any foreign customer, however depraved. And yet we\r\nare pained and surprised when any one suggests that we are occasionally\r\nhypocritical!\r\n\r\nBut the most striking conclusion to be drawn from the correspondence is\r\nthat Lord Clarendon, with all his knowledge of continental politics,\r\ndoes not seem to have fully grasped the really essential fact; he seems\r\nto have thought that by professions of friendship, by small concessions\r\non the part of France, and by the establishment of more liberal\r\ninstitutions in that country, the threatened danger might be averted,\r\nwhereas it was the fixed and inexorable determination of Bismarck to\r\nforce a conflict upon France whenever the favourable opportunity should\r\narise. A high tribute to Lord Clarendon's statesmanship was, however,\r\npaid by Bismarck at a later period. On making the acquaintance of one of\r\nhis daughters a few years later, he opened the conversation with the\r\nsingular remark that, never in the whole course of his life, had he been\r\nso relieved as when her father died; and then proceeded to explain that\r\nhad Lord Clarendon lived, there never would have been a Franco-German\r\nwar. As he did not enter into details, it may be presumed that he\r\nconsidered Lord Clarendon's influence to be so great that he might have\r\nsuccessfully persuaded the French to acquiesce in some insignificant\r\nenlargement of Prussia.\r\n\r\nAll the participators in the disarmament negotiation appear to have kept\r\ntheir counsel on the subject, and there is, at all events, no mention of\r\nit in the two standard works which deal with Bismarck's career.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [15] British Ambassador at Berlin.\r\n\r\n  [16] Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon, Feb. 18, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR\r\n\r\n(1870)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the barren disarmament negotiations were proceeding, the internal\r\npolitical situation in France had not improved. Though calm on the\r\nsurface, a section of the people was becoming more socialistic, and\r\nsocialism produced stagnation in business, a desire on the part of the\r\nlower classes for revolution and a corresponding desire on the part of\r\nthe middle classes for a strong government again. Ministers were uneasy,\r\nfor although the new Constitution had been well received by the country\r\nat large, its weak point lay in the right reserved by the Emperor of\r\nappealing to the people, a right which nothing could induce him to\r\nabandon, and which he was about to exercise by submitting the recent\r\nConstitutional changes to a plébiscite. Theoretically, this should have\r\nafforded gratification to the Republicans, as being in conformity with\r\ntheir view that the public should decide everything directly itself, but\r\nthey were in reality well aware that the French people were not yet\r\nRepublican in sentiment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, April 5, 1870.\r\n\r\n    There is a good deal of uneasiness in the French political world.\r\n    The great thing for the moment is that the Ministers should get a\r\n    good majority in the Chamber at the end of the debate on the new\r\n    Constitution which is now going on. They are afraid that some of\r\n    their usual supporters will abstain from voting. The 'Appeal to the\r\n    People' is so thoroughly Napoleonic an idea, and so completely in\r\n    accordance with the peculiar character and modes of thinking of\r\n    Napoleon III., that it would be very hard to make him give it up.\r\n    One cannot wonder at people's being distrustful of the use he may\r\n    make of it. The submitting the present changes in the Constitution\r\n    to a plébiscite is certainly legally necessary and admitted to be so\r\n    by all parties. What people are afraid of is that the Emperor will\r\n    insist upon calling for it in a Proclamation so worded as to make\r\n    the acceptance by the people a vote in favour of his person, as\r\n    against the Chambers and Ministers.\r\n\r\n    You will see from Claremont's report that the Government has agreed\r\n    to reduce the military contingent by another 10,000 men, making it\r\n    80,000 instead of 90,000 as the present Government proposed, and\r\n    instead of 100,000, as it was fixed by the late Government.\r\n\r\nIt was not surprising that the French Ministers, as well as many other\r\npeople, should feel suspicious about the plébiscite, and that frequent\r\ncouncils should have taken place at the Tuileries with the object of\r\ninducing the Emperor to consent that in future no plébiscite should be\r\nsubmitted to the people unless it had first been voted by the two\r\nChambers. For one thing, it was feared that few people would care enough\r\nabout it to take much trouble to vote, and it really did not seem very\r\nprobable that a peasant would take a long walk to express his opinion on\r\nthe question of whether the Senate should have the power of originating\r\ncertain laws. Therefore the Ministerial crisis which arose, and the\r\nEmperor's determination not to yield about the Appeal to the People,\r\nwere attributed to a Machiavellian plot on his part, and it was believed\r\nthat the return to personal government was to be brought about by\r\ngetting rid of the independent Ministers, Ollivier included. The belief\r\nwas possibly unfounded, but the Emperor's previous history had not\r\ninspired his people with implicit confidence in him, and they were\r\nalways convinced that he had an incurable taste for conspiracy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, April 13, 1870.\r\n\r\n    It is impossible not to feel very uneasy about the present state of\r\n    things in France and the sort of _locus standi_ that the enemies of\r\n    the Empire have obtained for suspecting the Emperor, who will be a\r\n    long time in recovering, if he ever does, the public confidence he\r\n    now seems to have lost. Revolutions are not made with half measures,\r\n    any more than with the proverbial rose water, and among the ships\r\n    that the Emperor was supposed to have burnt behind him when he\r\n    landed on the Constitutional shore, the plébiscite ought surely to\r\n    have been included. No doubt he would have divested himself of a\r\n    favourite weapon, but he should have foreseen the very serious\r\n    objections to it that would arise in the mind of the most moderate\r\n    friend of Constitutional Government, and he would have done far\r\n    better for himself to have given it up and taken his chance, for\r\n    with or without plébiscite, that is what he is now reduced to, and\r\n    his chances will be improved by endeavouring with sincerity to guide\r\n    the stream rather than oppose himself to it.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the crisis, both Daru and Buffet left the Ministry,\r\nthus weakening the Cabinet and diminishing materially the chance of a\r\nquiet and satisfactory establishment of Parliamentary Government. Thiers\r\nwas generally supposed to have been the principal mischief-maker.\r\nLord Russell was at this time in Paris, and in conversation with\r\nOllivier the latter expressed himself most confidently about the\r\nplébiscite, and thought that if six million people voted it might be\r\nlooked upon as a decided success. Another opinion on the plébiscite was\r\nvolunteered by Mr. Gladstone. 'If the Emperor is really stickling for\r\nthe right to refer when he pleases to the people for an Aye or No upon\r\na proposition which he is to frame, that, in my opinion, reduces\r\nConstitutional Government to an absolute mockery, just as it would\r\nreduce to a shadow the power of a Legislative Assembly.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, April 21, 1870.\r\n\r\n    The prospects of the quiet establishment of Constitutional\r\n    Government are in some respects better and in some worse. They are\r\n    better inasmuch as men of property, bankers, and others, are giving\r\n    money and exerting themselves to obtain a decided success for the\r\n    Plébiscite. They are worse, inasmuch as the suspicion of the\r\n    Emperor's intentions appears to increase, and people become more and\r\n    more afraid that if he gets a really large majority on the\r\n    Plébiscite, he will revert to personal government. The imprudent\r\n    language of the Right and their undisguised avowal of their hopes\r\n    produce this feeling. The Emperor himself has neither said nor done\r\n    anything to warrant it.\r\n\r\n    Ollivier asked me what progress had been made in the disarmament\r\n    question. I made him understand, without going into details, that it\r\n    must be let sleep for the present, and he agreed immediately.\r\n\r\n    There is a hitch about the English evidence before the Parliamentary\r\n    Committee on the Régime Parlementaire. The Committee have proposed\r\n    that only one English witness shall be heard. Emile Ollivier will do\r\n    his best to put things straight. I told him that if a proper and\r\n    courteous answer was made to our tender of evidence, I would\r\n    undertake that we would not abuse their civility by asking for too\r\n    much of their time.\r\n\r\n    Emile Ollivier dines with me to-day, and will, I hope, learn and\r\n    profit by Lord Russell's instruction in Constitutional Government.\r\n\r\nEnglish manufacturers were naturally desirous of putting their case\r\nbefore the Parliamentary Committee on the Commercial Treaty, but the\r\nmembers of the Committee did not appear equally desirous of hearing\r\nthem. According to Lord Lyons, who, like all his official contemporaries,\r\nwas in principle a Free Trader, and felt compassion for the misguided\r\neconomics of continental nations, the majority of the Committee were\r\ninfected by a politico-economical heresy which took the form of\r\ndemanding that any advantages which foreign manufacturers might enjoy,\r\nshould be balanced by import duties, which they persisted in calling\r\n'compensation.' His advice was that any English witnesses who might be\r\ncalled, should confine themselves very closely to facts and not allow\r\nthemselves to be led into discussions on trade principles, 'as it is not\r\neasy to reply in French to a Committee, of which the anti-Free Trade\r\nmembers are much hotter than the Free Traders.'\r\n\r\nAs the date of the plébiscite drew near, Ollivier's confidence and\r\nsatisfaction continued to increase, but some discomposure was caused by\r\nthe hostile action of Thiers and his friends. No one had ever expected\r\nthat Thiers would long endure that any Government of which he was not a\r\nmember should go on smoothly, and in the present instance, he was able\r\nto establish a plausible case by protesting that the Emperor, in\r\nreserving the right to appeal to the people, was nullifying liberal\r\ninstitutions. At an opportune moment, however, a plot against the\r\nEmperor's life was discovered, in which a man named Beaury was\r\nconcerned, and although of small importance, it was considered likely\r\nto produce a considerable effect upon public opinion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 6, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I thought Emile Ollivier rather out of spirits yesterday, or at all\r\n    events not so confident as he is usually. He seemed to hope the\r\n    publication of the details of the plot would produce a great effect\r\n    and increase the 'Ayes' for the Plébiscite. That there really was a\r\n    plot is certain, but it may be doubted whether the conspirators were\r\n    numerous enough, or were men of sufficient note, to make the danger\r\n    so great as to frighten the voters. I am not surprised at La\r\n    Valette's being out of spirits, for the situation is really very\r\n    critical, and it is difficult to conceive any ending which will\r\n    place him and Rouher where they were again.\r\n\r\n    With reference to Loftus's despatch, I sincerely hope that his most\r\n    confidential correspondent is not so well informed as he represents\r\n    himself to be, and that no change is really contemplated in the\r\n    _status quo_ of Hesse and Baden. It would be quite a mistake to\r\n    suppose that this is a moment at which it would be safe to defy\r\n    France. On the contrary, a war unmistakably provoked by Prussia,\r\n    would be hailed by many as a welcome diversion from internal\r\n    difficulties. So far as I can judge, _Ollivier is not the man to\r\n    shrink from one_. There is more security against a sudden surprise\r\n    than there was under the personal government, but there is also less\r\n    probability that the Emperor's health and personal views will\r\n    prevent war.\r\n\r\nThe plébiscite took place on May 8, and an ecstatic note from Ollivier\r\nannounced success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _M. E. Ollivier to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Paris le 9 mai, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n    La Victoire est complète!\r\n\r\n    A Paris nous avons gagné cent mille voix, et jusqu'à présent voici\r\n    les resultats.\r\n\r\n    Oui 6.189.506\r\n    Non 1.305.881\r\n\r\n    manquent 37 arrondissements, l'armée, la marine, l'Algérie.\r\n\r\nThe complete returns showed that about 7,250,000 voted 'Yes,' and\r\n1,500,000 'No.' The Minister was thus justified in his satisfaction.\r\nNearly all the big towns, including Paris, had voted against the\r\nGovernment, as had been expected, but on the other hand the agricultural\r\npopulation had showed itself to be practically unanimous in favour of\r\nthe Empire. One of the disquieting surprises was provided by the Army,\r\nno less than 50,000 votes being recorded against the Emperor. Riots, as\r\nusual, broke out in Paris after the voting was over, but were suppressed\r\nwithout difficulty. In connection with these riots an ingenious but\r\ndiscreditable device, was resorted to for the purpose of seducing the\r\nsoldiers in the Prince Eugène Barracks, these having been supplied by\r\nthe Republicans with _bons_ (orders for free admission) on the\r\nneighbouring houses of ill-fame, on the presumption that the holders of\r\nthese orders would feel peculiarly aggrieved at being confined to\r\nbarracks.\r\n\r\nThe general impression created was that a large majority was safer than\r\na moderate one would have been, and much safer than a very small one.\r\nThis was the view entertained by Lord Clarendon, who had always\r\nconsidered the plébiscite to be a great mistake, but was now anxious to\r\nmake the best of it, and instructed the Ambassador to congratulate\r\nOllivier and to express the hope that he would be able to surround\r\nhimself with Liberal Ministers determined to keep order. An Empire based\r\nupon soldiers and peasants could not be said to be placed on a solid\r\nfoundation, and no effort should be spared to enlarge the basis.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial success at the plébiscite produced a sycophantic outburst\r\namongst the diplomatists at Paris, and a movement was promoted by the\r\nNuncio and Prince Metternich, the Austrian Ambassador, with the object\r\nof asking for an audience, and offering the collective congratulations\r\nof the Diplomatic Corps to the Emperor. The ineptitude of the proposal\r\nwas evident.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, May 12, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I wish the flunkeyism of the Nuncio and Metternich was displayed in\r\n    some other way than congratulating the Emperor on the success of his\r\n    foolish Plébiscite. It is an improper interference in the internal\r\n    affairs of France, which, if allowed, would justify a remonstrance\r\n    of the Diplomatic Corps against some measure they disapproved; but,\r\n    of course, we can neither oppose nor abstain, and it will be well\r\n    for you to join cordially. But I hope there will be no expression of\r\n    opinion in favour of the Plébiscite, or recognition of it as a\r\n    component part of Constitutional Government. We should be justly\r\n    condemned if we joined however indirectly in any such opinion. I\r\n    asked La Valette this morning whether such congratulations would be\r\n    agreeable to the Emperor, and he answered, with a shrug of the\r\n    shoulders: 'Il a le gout des compliments.'\r\n\r\nUpon further consideration Lord Clarendon decided that it would be\r\nunwise if the British representative took any part in the proposed joint\r\ncongratulation, as it was foreseen that it might provoke awkward\r\ndiscussions in the House of Commons. Lord Lyons was therefore directed\r\nto inform Ollivier at once, that, much as the British Government\r\nsympathized with the Emperor and his dynasty, no worse service could be\r\ndone to him than by offering compliments upon his success. He would at\r\nonce be attacked for having invited or rather tolerated intervention in\r\nthe internal affairs of France, and the Queen of England, in an\r\nanalogous case, could not possibly accept such an address from\r\nforeigners as that would imply a sort of right to interfere which might\r\nprove extremely inconvenient. The Emperor would gain much more with the\r\nnation by courteously declining to receive foreign opinions upon his own\r\nacts and the domestic affairs of France, than by any assurance that\r\nForeign Governments were united in approving a measure about which there\r\nexisted a considerable difference of opinion in France. These views were\r\nto be communicated to Ollivier in a friendly manner with the assurance\r\nthat they should be brought to the Emperor's notice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    Paris, May 19, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I think we are well out of the scrape of the collective\r\n    congratulations. The notion was Metternich's and the Nuncio only\r\n    came into it to a certain degree, lest his refusing to do so should\r\n    give offence. So far as I know, the Nuncio has behaved very well,\r\n    and has not brought _us_ forward, but has simply told Metternich\r\n    that he found the Diplomatic Corps generally cold on the subject,\r\n    and therefore thought it better not to go on with it. Metternich\r\n    appears to have acquiesced. I have not seen him; he was out when I\r\n    called, which was, I think, lucky; and we have not met.\r\n\r\n    There is a Ball at the Tuileries on Monday, at which I shall\r\n    probably have a chance of saying something pleasant to Cæsar. I\r\n    shall be careful to keep within the terms sanctioned by Mr.\r\n    Gladstone. We may at any rate rejoice at the establishment of\r\n    Parliamentary Government in France, and hope, till we have evidence\r\n    to the contrary, that the means provided for upsetting it will not\r\n    be resorted to. The present Plébiscite was undoubtedly technically\r\n    necessary to the legality of the new Constitution, and as such was\r\n    insisted upon by Daru and other Liberals. Let us hope it will be the\r\n    last.\r\n\r\n    I have received the usual invitation in the name of the Emperor to\r\n    the function on Saturday evening. I must not leave the Embassy in\r\n    darkness if everybody else illuminates, but I think the idea a\r\n    foolish one, as being likely to give rise to street riots.\r\n\r\n    Two of the new Ministers are unknown to fame, but their appointment\r\n    is a relief to those who apprehended appointments from the Right.\r\n    There is no remarkable speaker in the Ministry except Ollivier\r\n    himself.\r\n\r\n    Gramont called upon me yesterday and was profuse in expressions of\r\n    friendship to England, to you, and to me.\r\n\r\nThe appointment, however, of the Duc de Gramont[17] could hardly have\r\nbeen in the nature of a relief, for, as far back as the beginning of\r\n1868, when Ambassador at Vienna, he had announced that he considered a\r\nFranco-Prussian war unavoidable.\r\n\r\nThe formal announcement of the result of the plébiscite was made to the\r\nEmperor on May 21, in the Salle des États of the Louvre, and must have\r\nbeen one of the last, if not the very last, of the brilliant ceremonies\r\nwhich marked the reign of Napoleon III. It was attended by all the\r\ndignitaries of the realm, the Senators, the deputies, the civic\r\nfunctionaries, the Diplomatic Corps; an imposing array of troops filled\r\nthe Place du Carrousel; and Cæsar himself, elevated upon a dais, replied\r\nto the congratulations offered to him by the Chambers in a speech full\r\nof those resounding and occasionally meaningless phrases which\r\ninvariably meet with a responsive echo in an assembly of Frenchmen. It\r\nwas, in fact, the final coruscation of the Imperial fireworks, and, in\r\nthe prosaic words of Lord Lyons, 'the ceremony went off extremely well.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Clarendon._\r\n\r\n    May 24, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I made a little speech to the Emperor about the Plébiscite at the\r\n    ball last night. I did not in fact go as far as Mr. Gladstone\r\n    allowed, but what I did say appeared to be to His Majesty's taste.\r\n    At all events he was extremely gracious and cordial. I don't know\r\n    that any one except the Prussian Ambassador has asked for a special\r\n    audience to deliver congratulations, but I have not made inquiries,\r\n    because I neither wished to put it into my colleagues' heads to do\r\n    so, nor to appear as if it seemed to me the natural thing to do. All\r\n    seems to be quite right with the Emperor and Empress, so far as H.M.\r\n    Government, and you in particular, and I am concerned. He has been a\r\n    good deal annoyed and disappointed by the tone of the English press.\r\n    After all, he has established a Constitutional form of Government,\r\n    more democratic than that which exists in England, and the worst way\r\n    to encourage him to persevere is to assume at once that he does not\r\n    mean to do so. Selfishly, we ought to remember that his influence in\r\n    the Government is the principal security we can have for _Free Trade\r\n    and cordiality between the two countries_.\r\n\r\n    What the Emperor will really do depends on the course of events. I\r\n    believe nothing of the stories of his having deep-laid schemes. It\r\n    is a pity that he has not stronger men in the Cabinet--men strong\r\n    enough to resist him in case of need--and to direct the Chamber. A\r\n    dissolution is hardly to be thought of at present. The people at\r\n    large would not stand being disturbed to vote again soon, and\r\n    consequently the votes would be few, and principally Republican.\r\n    There is danger in the influence of the Emperor's old political\r\n    friends, who want to regain their old position, and in some of the\r\n    influential military men who want a war for promotion and glory. And\r\n    there is danger in the position in which the Plébiscite has placed\r\n    him--owing mainly to the Republicans, who, much more than he is, are\r\n    to blame for making it a question between him personally and them.\r\n    The function of the 21st went off very well; indeed, wonderfully\r\n    well, considering how great a part of the audience was composed of\r\n    Senators and Councillors of State who have lost in importance by the\r\n    Constitutional change.\r\n\r\nThe excitement attending the plébiscite gave way before long to a\r\nfeeling of political lassitude, and to those surmises concerning the\r\nprobabilities of weathering the session which habitually preoccupy\r\nConstitutional Governments. It is of more interest to turn for a moment\r\nto a matter which is now fortunately viewed in a very different light.\r\n\r\nHaving been asked his advice on some question concerning Canada, Lord\r\nLyons wrote to Lord Clarendon the following as his deliberate opinion,\r\nand it must be borne in mind that he had had exceptional opportunities\r\nof studying the Canadian situation:--\r\n\r\n    I never feel comfortable about Canada and our North American\r\n    possessions. I do not believe we have the means of defending them\r\n    against the United States in case of war, and I am by no means\r\n    confident that the colonists would be unanimous and enthusiastic in\r\n    helping us to do so. I am afraid too that the colonists are\r\n    beginning to see that in matters short of war, we feel that we must\r\n    let the United States do very much as they please: in short that we\r\n    doubt our having the strength to resist them, and, unless under a\r\n    very strong provocation, have not the spirit to try. I was struck\r\n    by an observation made some time ago by the Governor of Newfoundland\r\n    respecting the French claims and the coast fisheries, viz. that the\r\n    Colonists felt that if the United States were their masters, the\r\n    questions would soon be settled in their favour. In fact it seems to\r\n    be in the nature of things that the United States' prestige should\r\n    grow and ours should wane in North America, and I wish we were well\r\n    and creditably out of the scrape.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the previous year he had already expressed the opinion\r\nthat the great problem for us in American politics was to find some fair\r\nand honourable way of dissolving all connection between England and our\r\nNorth American colonies.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon on his side was equally emphatic. 'I agree,' he wrote on\r\nJune 1, 'in every word you say about our possessions in North America,\r\nand wish that they would propose to be independent, and to annex\r\nthemselves. We can't throw them off, and it is very desirable that we\r\nshould part as friends.'\r\n\r\nThe views of Lord Stanley on this subject have already been quoted,\r\nand, if search were made, no doubt it would be discovered that similar\r\nsentiments were entertained by nearly all the mid-Victorian statesmen.\r\nI have a clear recollection of hearing, less than thirty years ago, a\r\nCabinet Minister, who had been Colonial Secretary, express the opinion\r\nthat 'colonies were expensive luxuries which only a rich country like\r\nEngland could afford to indulge in.'\r\n\r\nOne of the last letters written by Lord Clarendon refers to suspicions\r\ncreated by the visit to Ems of the Emperor of Russia, the King of\r\nPrussia, and Bismarck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Clarendon to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, June 8, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I have nothing of importance to write about.\r\n\r\n    Loftus says that the Berlin public is much _intrigué_ by the sudden\r\n    departure of the King and Bismarck for Ems, as the Czar was at\r\n    Berlin ten days before, when Bismarck pretended to be too ill to\r\n    come and meet him.\r\n\r\n    Bernstorff professes entire ignorance on the subject, and supposes\r\n    that, as Ems is now Prussian, the King thinks it necessary to give a\r\n    personal welcome to his Imperial relative.\r\n\r\n    This is possible, but not probable, and I suspect, though I can give\r\n    no good reason for so doing, that the more complete unification of\r\n    Germany occupies the Prussian mind, beginning of course by the\r\n    incorporation of Baden, and that it is thought desirable to get a\r\n    Russian sanction of the project, in the event of its leading to war\r\n    with France. One fails, however, to discover any reason why Russia\r\n    should make an enemy of France and endanger the peace of Europe in\r\n    order to justify the ambition of Prussia and enable the King to\r\n    unduly tax his subjects for an unnecessary army.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon's suspicions in this case were as correct as his prophecy\r\nwith regard to the establishment of a Republic in France, although the\r\nwords 'unnecessary army' might be taken exception to in the light of\r\nsubsequent events. Benedetti[18] happened to be in Paris at the time when\r\nLord Clarendon's letter arrived, and he informed Lord Lyons that he\r\nhad 'entire confidence in the assurances of the King of Prussia and\r\nBismarck, and that he did not apprehend any danger to peace, unless\r\ncircumstances were too strong for His Majesty and his Minister, and this\r\nhe thought improbable.' The idea of circumstances being too strong for\r\nBismarck might fairly be classed with the danger to Prussia\r\nthreatened by the appointment of Monsignor Klazko.\r\n\r\nLord Clarendon died on June 27, and was succeeded at the Foreign Office\r\non July 6 by Lord Granville. The celebrated announcement that there\r\nhad never been so great a lull in foreign affairs was made upon the\r\nauthority of Mr. Hammond,[19] whose singularly faulty judgment and\r\nunhappy prophecies have been already commented upon. At the same time,\r\nit must in justice be admitted that appearances in the early summer of\r\n1870 were unusually deceptive owing to the general calm which prevailed\r\nin the diplomatic world.\r\n\r\nWhen the Hohenzollern candidature thunderbolt fell in the early days\r\nof July, the Duc de Gramont lost no time in intimating to the British\r\nAmbassador that France would go to war with both Spain and Prussia\r\nrather than allow a Hohenzollern to reign at Madrid. But although\r\nGramont seemed bent upon committing the French Government to this\r\ncourse, he allowed it to be seen that he would be very grateful for any\r\nexertion England might make to induce the King of Prussia to forbid his\r\nkinsman to go on with his candidature. The election of Montpensier, he\r\nsaid, might be looked upon as a _mauvais procédé_ towards the Emperor\r\nand the dynasty, but the putting forward a Prussian was an insult and an\r\ninjury to all France. Similar language was held by the French Ambassador\r\nin London.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, July 6, 1870.\r\n\r\n    Your telegram of yesterday arrived while we were debating the Land\r\n    Bill. It took Mr. Gladstone and me by surprise. I received your\r\n    despatch and private letter this morning, and on my return from\r\n    Windsor, M. de La Valette called on me. He held the same language to\r\n    me as that reported by you to have been held by Gramont. France\r\n    disclaimed all interference with Spain, but stated the arguments\r\n    which made the possession of the Crown of Spain by a Prussian Prince\r\n    dangerous to France. I am writing to catch the post, and I cannot\r\n    repeat to you all the reasons which he gave, concluding by assuring\r\n    me that the circumstances were of the gravest character, and that in\r\n    his opinion, the Government of the Emperor could not, under the\r\n    pressure of public opinion, admit a project of such a nature. He\r\n    added however that there was no reason why any preliminary means\r\n    should not be tried to avert so great an evil, and he addressed\r\n    himself to the Government of the Queen, on the strength of our\r\n    friendly relations, and our desire to maintain the peace of Europe,\r\n    to exercise all our influence upon Prussia and upon Spain to stop\r\n    the project.\r\n\r\n    I told M. de La Valette of the surprise which the matter had been to\r\n    H.M. Government, that I perfectly understood the unfavourable effect\r\n    which such an announcement was contemplated to produce in France,\r\n    although I did not agree with all the arguments which he had used\r\n    with respect to the importance to so great a nation as France of a\r\n    German prince on the throne of Spain.\r\n\r\n    I said it was a matter of some regret to me that such strong\r\n    language as that reported by you to have been addressed to the\r\n    Prussian Ambassador should have been used. But I added that it was\r\n    not so much a moment for the general discussion, as to see what\r\n    could be done.\r\n\r\n    I readily assented to his request to use what influence we might\r\n    possess both with Prussia and Spain, but without any pretension\r\n    to dictate to either Power, to induce them to take into the most\r\n    serious consideration all the bearings of this question, such as its\r\n    gravity required, and I promised to communicate with you, Lord A.\r\n    Loftus, and Mr. Layard at once.\r\n\r\n    It is very sad that I should be writing to you in the place of one\r\n    who would have had so much personal power in such a matter as this.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, however, the explosion of Chauvinism in France and the\r\nattitude of the French Ministers rendered the situation more alarming\r\nfrom day to day. Undoubtedly the French Government desired and hoped to\r\ncarry their point without actual war, but Ministers had burnt their\r\nships and left themselves no means of escape if they failed in their\r\nattempt to win a moral victory over Prussia. As Gramont remarked,\r\n'_l'Avènement du Prince de Hohenzollern, c'est la guerre_!' It was\r\nalmost impossible to see what injury to French interests could be caused\r\nby the presence of a Hohenzollern at Madrid, but the question had been\r\ntaken up as a point of honour, and was therefore more dangerous than if\r\ntreated from a material point of view. The Emperor, according to Lord\r\nLyons, remained at this stage of the crisis, very calm and extremely\r\nconfident that he would get his way without war. There was no doubt that\r\nhe was strongly averse from war, partly on account of his own views, and\r\npartly on the ground of his ill-health, which would be a serious\r\ndrawback if he were forced to take the command of the army; but he also\r\nfelt that it would not be safe for him to submit to another rebuff from\r\nPrussia, and his Constitutional Ministers were inconveniently anxious to\r\nshow their spirit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 10, 1870.\r\n\r\n    The state of things to-day may be told in half a dozen words. If the\r\n    Prince of Hohenzollern's renunciation is announced in 24 or 48\r\n    hours, there will be peace _for the moment_. If not, there will be\r\n    an immediate declaration of war against Prussia. I cannot however\r\n    answer for even this situation lasting for the 48 hours. The French\r\n    are getting more and more excited. They think they have got the\r\n    start of Prussia this time in forwardness of preparation; that they\r\n    have a better cause of war, as being one less likely to rouse the\r\n    Germans, than they are likely to get again; and in fact that they\r\n    must have it out with Prussia sooner or later; and that they had\r\n    better not throw away this chance. When I say that I cannot answer\r\n    for things remaining in as favourable a situation as they are now,\r\n    for 48 hours, I mean that if the excitement goes on, the French may\r\n    choose to pick a quarrel on the form of the renunciation, or some\r\n    other pretext, even if the Prince retires.\r\n\r\n    End how it will, the whole affair is a terrible misfortune, for the\r\n    French and the Prussians will hate each other more than ever, and I\r\n    hardly expect to see their animosity come back to the quiescent\r\n    state in which it was a month ago.\r\n\r\n    Gramont says that, so far from the energetic language and\r\n    preparations of France thwarting your endeavours to preserve peace,\r\n    they afford the only chance of your succeeding.\r\n\r\n    I told him I did not at all agree with him.\r\n\r\nThis letter reveals two colossal errors on the part of the French. They\r\nhonestly thought that they were better prepared for war than the\r\nPrussians, and they believed that the latter could be successfully\r\nintimidated.\r\n\r\nAs late as July 12 Lord Granville still believed that Prussia did not\r\nreally want war, and hoped that the pressure applied to the Hohenzollern\r\nPrince by Queen Victoria and other important personages would avert the\r\ncalamity. Writing on the same day, Lord Lyons said that he did not\r\ndespair of peace, but that the war feeling was very strong, both in and\r\nout of the Ministry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, July 13, 1870.\r\n\r\n    Nothing can be better than your work at Paris, and I only wish it\r\n    may prove successful. My colleagues and the House of Commons are\r\n    getting very angry, and Gladstone wishes me to use stronger language\r\n    to the French Government than would, in my opinion, be useful for\r\n    the object, although it is true that no nation is powerful enough in\r\n    these times to stand up against the public opinion of Europe.\r\n\r\n    Your telegram of this evening leaves some hope, but I very much\r\n    doubt whether, even if we are asked by France, we can exert any more\r\n    pressure on Prussia, who in substance has done all that we were told\r\n    to ask and all that Gramont said was necessary to put an end to the\r\n    dispute.\r\n\r\n    La Valette is very angry. He gets a communication from his Foreign\r\n    Office once in three days, and then there is hardly anything in it.\r\n    His argument to-day is probably not the one his Government uses. 'I\r\n    do not, like everybody else, suspect the French of having had a\r\n    project of going to war. But having got into the wrangle, having\r\n    found their warlike preparations so popular, and having roused\r\n    effectually the feelings of France and Prussia, they do not like to\r\n    abstain from a fight, which they think will come, and in which\r\n    during the next six weeks their enemies would be unprepared.\r\n\r\n    I have some thoughts of asking the Cabinet, if war is declared,\r\n    whether it would be wise to ask both Governments whether they are\r\n    prepared to respect the neutrality of Belgium. It is always safer,\r\n    or at least, generally so, to do nothing; but both, in doubt, would\r\n    be more likely to give a favourable answer, than either flushed with\r\n    victory. Let me know what you think, and please make any other\r\n    suggestions which may occur to you if the emergency arises.\r\n\r\n    As far as I can judge, all the Neutral Powers are sincerely anxious\r\n    for peace. Italy, certainly so. The only thing which we have done,\r\n    of which I doubt, is having asked Italy a leading question about an\r\n    Italian Prince. They seem to wish to entangle us further in the\r\n    matter. It was of great importance before Spain and France were\r\n    reconciled, but now I presume it will be discreet to let this matter\r\n    remain in the hands of the parties concerned.\r\n\r\nThe phrase 'in which during the next six weeks their enemies would be\r\nunprepared,' seems to imply that H.M. Government were singularly\r\nill-informed as to the true state of Prussian military efficiency.\r\n\r\nUpon July 14, Lord Lyons reported that an article in the _North German\r\nGazette_ seemed to make war absolutely inevitable, and that Benedetti,\r\nwho was expected in Paris the following day, confirmed the accuracy of\r\nthe newspaper. Werther, too, the Prussian Ambassador, had announced to\r\nGramont that 'he had been granted leave of absence and was about to take\r\nadvantage of it immediately.' Even the guileless Hammond was alarmed.\r\n'Why Bismarck went to Berlin instead of Ems, and finally retired to\r\nVarzin without personal communications with his master, is not easy to\r\nexplain, and with a person of his character the proceeding is somewhat\r\nsuspicious.' The last hope of peace practically vanished when Bismarck\r\nintimated that he could not recommend to the King for acceptance the\r\nproposal made by H.M. Government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 16, 1870.\r\n\r\n    It will be a miracle if we are as good friends with France six\r\n    months after the beginning of this wretched war, as we are now, and\r\n    it will require the utmost tact, prudence and consideration for\r\n    French susceptibilities to prevent all the improvement in feeling\r\n    between the two nations, which has grown up in the last twenty\r\n    years, being entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\n    We have already a question with Gramont about his assertion that we\r\n    recognized the justice of his complaint. I hope it may be possible\r\n    to let this drop, but if not it is to be noted that, my memorandum\r\n    correcting the assertion on your authority was in his hands the\r\n    night before he repeated the assertion in his declaration of\r\n    yesterday.\r\n\r\n    In referring to his declaration that if the Hohenzollern\r\n    renunciation were obtained, France would be satisfied, it may be\r\n    well to bear in mind that the exact words he used to me were: '_If\r\n    the Prince of Hohenzollern should now, on the advice of the King of\r\n    Prussia_, withdraw his acceptance of the Crown the whole affair\r\n    would be at an end.'\r\n\r\n    This point becomes of less importance as France now seems to set the\r\n    Hohenzollern affair aside altogether, and to rest her _casus belli_\r\n    wholly on the boast of the affront to Benedetti.\r\n\r\n    Above all things we must try and keep as much as possible out of\r\n    Blue Books. If it is absolutely necessary to have one now, pray let\r\n    me have the opportunity of looking over anything of mine which it is\r\n    proposed to publish, and suggesting omissions. It would also be a\r\n    great relief to me to be allowed to consult Gramont himself, as I\r\n    did La Valette on the Cretan Blue Book. The cases are not the same,\r\n    and I might not use the power, but I should like to have it. I am\r\n    the more alarmed with regard to Gramont, as his reputation for\r\n    inaccuracy is so universal, that there must be some foundation for it.\r\n\r\n    Newspaper correspondents, amateur travellers, and so forth, are\r\n    already tormenting me to get them leave to accompany the French\r\n    Army. I believe none are to be allowed; but if it be otherwise, I\r\n    think the danger of being held responsible for their indiscretions\r\n    would be so great and so damaging to our relations with France, that\r\n    I do not think I should be justified in applying for leave on any\r\n    private recommendation, however strong: in fact, I should not be\r\n    willing to apply on anything short of a distinct official order, in\r\n    each case from you; and such an order I should be sorry to receive.\r\n\r\n    I tremble at the thought of the Blockades. Those during the American\r\n    Civil War kept us in perpetual hot water and within an inch of war\r\n    with the United States, and the labours of working out the cases\r\n    without coming to a rupture was very nearly the death of me. Heaven\r\n    defend us from anything like an _Alabama_ case with the French!\r\n\r\n    It is important that I should know as soon as possible whether our\r\n    Embassy at Berlin might take charge of French subjects in Prussia.\r\n    I am pretty sure to be sounded very soon, and might perhaps be able\r\n    to soften the very bad impression a refusal would make, by\r\n    preventing the request being made. I should wish us to accept, and I\r\n    don't see why, as impartial neutrals, we might not take charge also\r\n    of the Prussians in Paris, if we were asked, though I would rather\r\n    avoid this if possible.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment the _Liberté_ caused some embarrassment by\r\npublishing more or less correct details respecting the secret\r\nnegotiations which had taken place earlier in the year between Lord\r\nClarendon and Bismarck on the question of disarmament. Lord Granville\r\nhad not been in the confidence of Lord Clarendon, and it now was\r\nnecessary to explain to him what had passed. How the _Liberté_ obtained\r\nits information does not appear. Daru always stoutly maintained that he\r\nhad not mentioned the matter to any one except the Emperor and Ollivier,\r\nand the disclosures involved not only a gross breach of confidence on\r\nthe part of some one--presumably a French Foreign Office official--but\r\nalso a danger that Bismarck might demand explanations. The tremendous\r\nevents, however, of the next few weeks, diverted attention from the\r\n_Liberté's_ revelations. War was formally declared on July 19.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 19, 1870.\r\n\r\n    The war has been forced upon the Emperor principally by his\r\n    own party in the Chamber, the Right, and by his Ministers.\r\n    Constitutional Government has so far established itself that a\r\n    Ministry in a minority in the Corps Législatif is as much bound to\r\n    go out as a Ministry in the House of Commons. The Emperor was in a\r\n    bad position to resist, because after the line taken at the time of\r\n    Sadowa, it would have been too dangerous for him to be put forward\r\n    as the cause of France's truckling to Prussia. The whole affair is a\r\n    series of blunders which has culminated in an awful catastrophe.\r\n\r\n    Gramont told me this afternoon that La Valette wrote him a very\r\n    _bizarre_ story. La Valette said that it had been considered by the\r\n    British Cabinet whether they should not send an English force to\r\n    occupy Belgium during the war, which would be a strange way of\r\n    showing respect for Belgian neutrality.\r\n\r\n    I should myself be very sorry to see a British soldier landed on the\r\n    Continent, and seriously alarmed if any force that was landed was\r\n    under a hundred thousand strong.\r\n\r\n    Gramont told me also that Bray[20] had hit upon a combination to\r\n    which France would have no objection if it were possible. Bray\r\n    declared that Bavaria would be neutral if the neutrality of Baden\r\n    were secured. Gramont said however that of course to carry out such\r\n    an arrangement, the Prussian troops must retire from Rastadt.\r\n\r\n    He said he had just been informed that Italy had called out two\r\n    classes of her military contingent. He did not know what this might\r\n    mean. Italy has not yet made to France any declaration of policy.\r\n\r\n    Gramont concluded by saying that he supposed all the Minor States\r\n    would wait for a battle and then declare for the victor.\r\n\r\nThe neutrality of Belgium was, of course, one of the main preoccupations\r\nof H.M. Government, but there is no reason to suppose that a British\r\noccupation was ever seriously contemplated, and La Valette's report on\r\nthe subject was probably caused by the vanity of appearing to possess\r\nspecial pieces of information which often leads diplomatists astray.\r\nBelgium was not, however, the only country which had reason to feel\r\nalarmed. The position of Denmark before hostilities actually began\r\nbetween France and Prussia was both painful and critical. The Danish\r\nMinister at Paris appeared at the British Embassy in great distress,\r\nsaying that he knew nothing of what his Government intended, and asking\r\nfor information; as it seemed quite likely that the Danish capital would\r\nbe occupied by whichever of the two opposing armies could get there\r\nfirst. It was common knowledge that a great expedition was fitting out\r\nfor Copenhagen at Cherbourg, and that General Trochu, who passed for\r\nabout the best French general, was to command it. And if French forces\r\nappeared off Copenhagen it would be impossible to restrain the people\r\nfrom marching against the Prussians, although there was, as yet\r\napparently, no understanding between the French and Danish Governments.\r\n\r\nOn July 25 the _Times_ surprised the world by publishing the text of a\r\ndraft treaty concerning the annexation of Belgium which it was alleged\r\nhad been submitted by the French Government to Bismarck in 1866.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 26, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I have had some conversation with Gramont about the nefarious Projet\r\n    de Traité which the _Times_ has given to the world, but as he has\r\n    written to La Valette about it, I had better leave you to receive\r\n    from him the French version. The only curious, and to me quite new\r\n    statement which he made, was that Bismarck had at one time offered,\r\n    if France was afraid of the odium of occupying Belgium, to occupy it\r\n    first himself, and then to retire in apparent deference to\r\n    remonstrances from France, and so give France a pretext for\r\n    entering.\r\n\r\n    It has long been a common belief among diplomatists that France and\r\n    Prussia have at different times discussed the propriety of seizing,\r\n    the one upon Belgium, the other upon Holland. No such scandalous\r\n    iniquity has been contemplated since the partition of Poland, and it\r\n    is much worse than the partition of Poland, for there might be some\r\n    colourable assertions that Poland was turbulent, ill-governed, that\r\n    most of the population were serfs, and that she was an inconvenient\r\n    neighbour. But Belgium and Holland are free, extremely well\r\n    governed, and, to say the least, perfectly inoffensive neighbours.\r\n    One must leave it to the parties concerned to defend themselves from\r\n    the reproach of such odious projects, and I hope they will.\r\n\r\n    The insinuation in the leading article in the _Times_ that the\r\n    subject has been revived by France since the Hohenzollern crisis\r\n    seems to me to be extremely improbable.\r\n\r\n    Bernstorff's attempts to make you vouch for the authenticity of the\r\n    _Projet_, without committing himself, is as poor a little trick as I\r\n    ever heard of.\r\n\r\n    I send you in a despatch the official account of the cause of the\r\n    tardiness in producing Benedetti's despatch, that is to say,\r\n    delicacy on the part of Gramont. The version accepted by the public\r\n    is that the whole affair had been forgotten at the Ministère until\r\n    at last Benedetti himself remembered it and had it looked up.\r\n\r\nWith the object of prejudicing European opinion against Prussia, the\r\nEmperor wrote the well-known letter to Gramont from Metz, on July 28,\r\naccusing Bismarck of having proposed to France the annexation of\r\nBelgium, but the sole result was that both parties were shown to have\r\nplayed an equally sordid part in the transaction, and they were\r\nconsequently both induced to agree to the English proposal that they\r\nshould give a new and formal pledge not to violate Belgian integrity.\r\n\r\nIn a letter dated July 31, is a dispassionate analysis of the inadequate\r\ncauses which had brought about a rupture at that particular moment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, July 31, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I see the public, with their usual tendency to attribute everything\r\n    to deep-laid plots and schemes, generally suppose that war was a\r\n    foregone conclusion on the part of France and of Prussia. I don't\r\n    believe it in the case of Prussia, and I know it not to be the fact\r\n    as regards France. Prussia threw the first stone, by bringing on the\r\n    Hohenzollern question. France made a peaceful settlement difficult\r\n    by Gramont's irritating declaration on the 6th. The cause of the\r\n    change from a mild to an irritating declaration was the arrival of\r\n    the report from the Chargé d'Affaires at Berlin, that Thile[21]\r\n    pooh-poohed the French remonstrance, and said that the question\r\n    _n'existait pas pour le Gouvernement Prussien_. Then came the\r\n    great fault of France in not accepting the renunciation of the\r\n    Hohenzollern as a final settlement; but, even at the last moment the\r\n    declaration of the 16th would have concluded with a phrase leaving\r\n    the door open to the mediation of a Congress, if the article in the\r\n    _North German Gazette_ had not arrived, and convinced the French\r\n    that Bismarck had decided upon war. However, it is no use crying\r\n    over spilt milk.\r\n\r\n    I understand that the Emperor writes to the Empress that no great\r\n    action is to be expected for three or four days. At the French Head\r\n    Quarters there was an apprehension that the Prussians might attempt\r\n    to turn the right flank of the French Army.\r\n\r\nSubsequent revelations have shown how profoundly the course of events\r\nwas influenced by the action of Bismarck in connection with the tone of\r\nthe German press, and by his distortion of the celebrated Ems interview\r\nbetween the King of Prussia and Benedetti, but this was of course\r\nunknown at the time.\r\n\r\nOne humorous incident in connection with the outbreak of hostilities is\r\nworth recording. Animated by what Lord Clarendon would have called the\r\nspirit of flunkeyism, the Paris diplomatists grew greatly excited over\r\nthe question of illuminations in the event of French victories. As was\r\nonly to be expected, the accommodating Austrian Ambassador was foremost\r\nin advocating rejoicings, and he and his Italian colleague were bent\r\nupon illuminating their Embassies, while the representatives of the\r\nsmaller Powers, such as Switzerland, who lived in less conspicuous\r\nabodes, opposed the proposal, and were supported by the British\r\nAmbassador. The question was referred home, and the Foreign Office took\r\nthe common-sense view that the Ambassador should not illuminate without\r\nnecessity, but should do so rather than cause trouble or give offence.\r\n\r\nThe early reverses of the campaign were concealed from the public with\r\nsome success, MacMahon's defeat being known at the Embassy twelve hours\r\nbefore the official announcement; but as soon as the truth came out, the\r\npopulation of the capital seems to have believed that the Germans would\r\nat once appear before Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Aug. 8, 1870.\r\n\r\n    If the panic in the army is as great as it is in the capital, it is\r\n    all over with France. One would think that the Prussians were\r\n    already in Montmartre. There must, it is supposed, be a great battle\r\n    fought before they can get there, and the French may win it.\r\n\r\n    I have been beset with Representatives of small Powers, all except\r\n    the Belgian, in consternation, and with Rothschilds and other\r\n    bankers in despair. They hope England will interfere to stop the\r\n    Prussian army on its road to Paris: not an easy task if the road is\r\n    open.\r\n\r\n    All Gramont could or would tell me was that the Emperor was\r\n    concentrating forces between Metz and Chalons, and that a great\r\n    battle was expected.\r\n\r\n    I was really ashamed to speak to him about our Treaty, but I thrust\r\n    your despatch on him, knowing you were anxious to avoid delay. He\r\n    said: _n'ayez pas peur, nous n'avons pas grande envie d'entrer en\r\n    Belgique dans ce moment_.\r\n\r\nIn the Chamber, no one, even on the Right, had the generosity to say a\r\nsingle word in defence of the unfortunate Emperor when a declaration was\r\nmade from the Tribune that all the disasters were due to the\r\ninefficiency of the Commander-in-Chief. Ollivier and his colleagues\r\nresigned, and General Trochu, who had been given an unimportant command\r\nin the South, was hailed as the possible saviour of the country, and\r\noffered, in vain, the War Office in the new administration of Count\r\nPalikao. It is instructive to note that Gramont (upon whom Bismarck\r\nsubsequently heaped the most savage contempt) denied to Lord Lyons that\r\nhe had ever been in favour of war. According to him, the strongest\r\nphrase in the declaration of July 6 was inserted at the Council on that\r\nmorning, and was not in his draft, and he threw the blame of the\r\nimprudent haste in going to war on Leboeuf's confident declaration that\r\nneither France nor any other country had ever been so well prepared for\r\nwar before. Leboeuf's celebrated declaration about gaiter buttons has\r\nalways been cited as almost unequalled for fatuity, but it is an\r\nundoubted fact that Gramont himself was convinced that a Franco-Prussian\r\nwar was inevitable, and he is not known to have discouraged the idea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Aug. 16, 1870.\r\n\r\n    So far as we can conjecture, the military situation is very bad, and\r\n    the political is certainly as bad as can be. There are ups and downs\r\n    in the spirits of the French about the war, but the Emperor and the\r\n    dynasty seem simply to sink lower and lower. La Tour d'Auvergne[22]\r\n    speaks still as a loyal subject, but I know of no one else who does.\r\n    The Empress shows pluck, but not hope. She has sent her nieces away,\r\n    and she summoned the Bonapartes in Paris to the Tuileries yesterday,\r\n    and told them plainly that the time was come for them to look after\r\n    themselves.\r\n\r\n    No party wishes to come into office, with the risk of having to sign\r\n    a disadvantageous peace. It is this which has hitherto kept the Left\r\n    within bounds. They wish the peace to be made by the Emperor before\r\n    they upset him. No one can tell what the effect of a victory might\r\n    be; few people expect one, and fewer still believe that the effect\r\n    would be to set the Emperor on his legs again. The Paris population\r\n    so far seems to have behaved well.\r\n\r\nThe one thing, in fact, upon which there seemed to be general agreement\r\nwas that the Empire was doomed.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of August the feeling in Paris against England, produced\r\nlargely by articles in the London press, had reached a very disagreeable\r\npoint, and the Ambassador was obliged to ask that he might be spared\r\nfrom having to make too many obnoxious communications to the French\r\nGovernment; these communications consisting of complaints put forward by\r\nthe Prussian Government through the channel of the British Embassy at\r\nParis, which it was really the duty of the United States Legation to\r\ndeal with.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Mr. Hammond._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Aug. 23, 1870.\r\n\r\n    The last paragraph of your letter of this morning frightens me not a\r\n    little. You say the Prussians complain of a flag of truce being\r\n    fired upon and of field hospitals being shot at; and you add: 'You\r\n    will probably hear from us about these matters, if Bernstorff makes\r\n    a formal representation.' I hope this does not imply that you mean\r\n    to adopt all Prussian complaints as British, and make me the channel\r\n    of communicating them to the French Government. Please do not forget\r\n    that the United States Legation, not this Embassy, represents\r\n    Prussian interests in France, and that if you impose upon me such\r\n    works of supererogation as making unpleasant communications from\r\n    Prussia, you will expose me to well-merited snubs, and damage my\r\n    position so much that I shall be able to effect very little in a\r\n    real emergency. The particular things which you mention ought not to\r\n    be made the subject of diplomatic representation at all: they ought\r\n    to be discussed by Flag of Truce between the two Generals.\r\n\r\nWhy H.M. Government should have taken the inexplicable course of\r\ngratuitously offending the French Government is not explained, but at\r\nall events the practice was abandoned.\r\n\r\nWhen, towards the end of August, it was announced that the Crown Prince\r\nwas advancing upon Paris, the Empress, the members of the Government,\r\nand the Chambers, proclaimed their determination to stay in the town.\r\nThe Empress probably feared that if she once left, she might never\r\nreturn; but the decision to attempt to govern a country from a besieged\r\ntown was so obviously unpractical that it can hardly have been taken\r\nseriously, for it was plain that each party in turn would discover that\r\nit was essential to be in communication with the outside world. The\r\nEmpress herself seems to have preserved her fortitude during this\r\nunhappy period. 'I saw the Empress yesterday,' wrote Lord Lyons, on\r\nSeptember 1, 'for the first time since the war. She was calm and\r\nnatural, well aware, I think, of the real state of things, but\r\ncourageous without boasting or affectation. She let me know by La Tour\r\nd'Auvergne that she would like to see me. She did not invite, nor did I\r\noffer any advice or any assurances or conjectures as to what England or\r\nany other Power was likely to do.'\r\n\r\nWithin three or four days of this interview the Empress herself was a\r\nfugitive, the Empire had collapsed without a hand being raised to defend\r\nit, and the mob, breaking into the Chamber, had called the Third\r\nRepublic into existence. The delight of changing one form of government\r\nwas so great that the French almost forgot for the moment that the enemy\r\nwas practically at the gates of Paris, but M. Jules Favre, the Minister\r\nfor Foreign Affairs in the new Provisional Government, lost no time in\r\ncommunicating with Lord Lyons and sounding him with regard to mediation.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jules Favre, the new Government had two courses of action\r\nin view. The first was to proclaim loudly that France would fight to the\r\ndeath rather than make any undue concessions to Prussia. This was the\r\ncourse intended for public consumption. The second and practical course\r\nwas to accept cordially the intervention of Foreign Powers with the\r\nobject of restricting French sacrifices within endurable limits. In\r\nother words, he thought that France ought to submit to paying the\r\nexpenses of the war, provided her territorial integrity remained intact.\r\nAs for agreeing to a cession of territory, no man in France would\r\nventure even to speak of such a thing, and the Government and the people\r\nwere equally determined to perish rather than give way upon it. The\r\npublic, and in particular, the inhabitants of Paris were greatly averse\r\nfrom any pecuniary sacrifice, but he (obviously considering himself\r\nto be an exceptionally far-seeing statesman) felt so strongly that a\r\npecuniary sacrifice was necessary, that unless the principle was acceded\r\nto, he should feel bound to leave the Government. If, therefore, foreign\r\nGovernments would offer mediation upon the basis of keeping French\r\nterritory intact, their intervention would be extremely useful and ought\r\nto be admitted gratefully by France. If, however, Foreign Powers could\r\nonly mediate on the basis of a cession of territory, their interference\r\nwould be ineffectual and offensive, rather than agreeable to France.\r\n\r\nIt is rather surprising, in view of this artless opinion, to learn that\r\nJules Favre seemed to be pretty well acquainted with the feeling in\r\nGermany; and, at all events, he realized that the one neutral Power who\r\nwas likely to influence Prussia was Russia. It is also rather surprising\r\nto learn that he considered the immediate proclamation of a Republic to\r\nbe a mistake, due to the impetuosity of the Paris population, and\r\ncalculated to alienate the French provinces as well as foreign\r\nGovernments, and he was forced to admit that the new Government was\r\ncompletely under the control of the mob.\r\n\r\nOn September 6, a surreptitious interview took place between Lord Lyons\r\nand M. Thiers, who was not a member of the Government of National\r\nDefence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Sept, 6, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I have had conversations to-day, both with Thiers and with Jules\r\n    Favre. They think they can bring public opinion to accept a peace\r\n    with a large pecuniary indemnity to Prussia, but they are afraid of\r\n    being thought by the populace to be begging the aid of England at\r\n    this moment: so much so, that Thiers was afraid either of coming\r\n    here or of my going to his house, and asked me to meet him at\r\n    Alphonse de Rothschild's.\r\n\r\n    I put to him the extreme difficulty of inducing Prussia to accept\r\n    mediation without securing some cession of territory, and asked him\r\n    whether he would still be in favour of its being offered, even if\r\n    Prussia were almost certain to reject it. He considered the Pros and\r\n    Cons. On the one hand, he saw danger to France and to Europe, if the\r\n    neutral Powers should look quietly on, while France was being\r\n    destroyed, without any sort of mark of feeling, or of protest\r\n    against her dismemberment. On the other hand, he did not conceal\r\n    from himself that it might lower the authority of the other Powers,\r\n    and in some sort put a seal upon the predominance of Prussia, if\r\n    they spoke in vain and took no steps to give effect to their\r\n    language. After some consideration, however, he said he inclined\r\n    to the opinion that the offer should at all events be made.\r\n\r\n    I told Jules Favre that Thiers had hesitated about this. He answered\r\n    at once: 'I do not hesitate for a moment. I decidedly wish the\r\n    mediation, on the basis of the integrity of our territory, to be\r\n    made, whether Prussia accepts it or not.'\r\n\r\n    Jules Favre was very decided about the armistice. He thought France\r\n    could not herself ask for one, in her present position, but it was\r\n    plain enough (which is certainly not at all surprising) that he\r\n    would be very grateful to any neutral Power who would try to bring\r\n    one about.\r\n\r\n    Time presses, for the Prussians may be said to be almost literally\r\n    at the gates.\r\n\r\n    Thiers pointed out with all his clearness and eloquence the danger\r\n    to the different nations of Europe, of the predominance of Prussia,\r\n    and dwelt also a good deal upon the risk of a Red Republic, with a\r\n    foreign propaganda, etc., etc., if the present Government were\r\n    overthrown in consequence of further military reverses, or of a\r\n    disgraceful peace. He pointed out that, with the exception of\r\n    Rochefort, all the Provisional Government were Moderate Republicans\r\n    and honest men. Rochefort was, he said, very manageable and less\r\n    dangerous in the Government than out of it. He was in hopes order\r\n    would be maintained, but he did not shut his eyes to the fact that\r\n    the Government was without the means of resisting the mob of Paris,\r\n    if the mob should become excited or enraged by defeats.\r\n\r\n    There seems to me to be a great deal of depression in Paris. People\r\n    seem to feel that an obstinate defence of the town might only lead\r\n    to its destruction and leave France more at the mercy of Prussia\r\n    than ever. They have also a great dread, that while the respectable\r\n    citizens are on the ramparts, the Reds may pillage the town.\r\n\r\n    How all this may turn out, I do not pretend to guess. The first\r\n    days of a Revolution are generally those on which the mob behaves\r\n    the best. Hitherto everybody has behaved extremely well, and only a\r\n    few people have suffered from the unfortunate epidemic which\r\n    prevails and makes every one who cannot speak French well be taken\r\n    for a Prussian spy.\r\n\r\n    Jules Favre has not yet announced his appointment as Minister for\r\n    Foreign Affairs, nor, I think, seen any of the Foreign Diplomatists\r\n    except me. The circular which he has prepared for Foreign Powers\r\n    is very fierce in its language, but it mentions peace, and even\r\n    pronounces the word '_traiter_' and he seems to consider it rather a\r\n    bold step towards accustoming the people of Paris to the idea of\r\n    treating while the Prussians are still on French soil.\r\n\r\nLord Granville, as his letters show, was at first by no means anxious to\r\nmediate, but altered his mind, because he was under the impression that\r\nthe change of government in Paris had made the Prussians more anxious to\r\ntreat. The French were not to be informed of this altered attitude on\r\nthe part of their adversary but were to be encouraged to put forward\r\n'elastic' proposals, Bismarck having graciously intimated that he had\r\nno objection to England becoming the channel of communication. The\r\nobjections to mediation were sufficiently obvious. If the basis of a\r\ncession of territory were to be adopted, then it would be clearly\r\nundesirable for any neutral country to attempt to exercise any pressure\r\nupon France, and there would not be anything to be gained by such\r\naction, for France could always obtain peace on these terms from Prussia\r\nwithout foreign aid. If, on the other hand, mediation was adopted on the\r\nbasis of the integrity of French territory, there appeared to be little\r\nor no chance of success.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the unpromising prospects various attempts were made to\r\nsound the views of the Prussian Government with regard to an eventual\r\npeace on the basis of integrity of territory. The Russians were\r\nrequested by the French to make known the terms on which the latter were\r\nprepared to treat. Communications at Berlin were made by the Italian\r\nGovernment, and the meddling Beust caused it to be announced to the\r\nPrussian Government that France would accept an armistice on the\r\ncondition of territorial integrity. As he was a _persona ingratissima_\r\nto Bismarck, his efforts were not likely to meet with much success, and\r\nit was intimated to him and to the others that Bismarck reserved to\r\nhimself all discussions concerning the conditions of peace, and that the\r\nPrussian officials at Berlin had no authority to enter upon such\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nBefore anything definite was decided upon as to how the Prussian\r\nGovernment was to be approached, Thiers started upon his historic\r\nmission to the Courts of the various Great Powers with the object of\r\nenlisting their practical sympathy on behalf of France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, Sept. 12, 1870.\r\n\r\n    The provisional Government, though the most moderate and regular I\r\n    ever heard of, is sometimes a little sudden in its movements; and\r\n    accordingly Thiers's mission was announced in the _Journal Official_\r\n    before Jules Favre mentioned it to me, though I must do him the\r\n    justice to say that he came at an early hour for the purpose. It is\r\n    patriotic of Thiers to undertake it at his age, and with a prospect\r\n    at best of assisting to make a bitter peace just supportable. I am\r\n    glad you should hear from him the real state of things as to the\r\n    internal condition and prospects of society and Government in\r\n    France. He will also, I suppose, bring you the last word of the\r\n    Provisional Government on peace. My impression is that they will\r\n    give up almost anything to save territory; but they are, or at all\r\n    events believe themselves, capable of a great _coup de désespoir_\r\n    rather than yield that. The Reds within are more likely to give\r\n    permanent trouble than the Prussians without.\r\n\r\n    Some of my colleagues are I am afraid rather cross at my not setting\r\n    them the example of going off to Tours. The notion under present\r\n    circumstances seems to me most injudicious. Either the French will\r\n    make terms as soon as the enemy approach Paris, or being unable to\r\n    do so, they will stand a siege and announce a desperate resistance.\r\n    Upon this last contingency coming to pass we had better get out of\r\n    Paris as fast as we can; but if there is negotiation we may possibly\r\n    be of use here, while we could certainly be of none at Tours, to\r\n    say nothing of the absurdity of our going off under present\r\n    circumstances to Tours, without the Minister for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe various interviews which took place between Thiers and Lord\r\nGranville have been described at length by Lord Fitzmaurice. In the\r\nmain, the causes of the war, as expounded by Thiers, were in accordance\r\nwith those described by Lord Lyons in the letters previously quoted,\r\nalthough he seems to have unjustly laid much of the responsibility upon\r\nthe Empress, and to have unduly exalted his own prescience, having\r\nalways been obsessed with the idea that he was a military genius. As for\r\nthe form of government in France, although an Orleanist himself, he\r\nconsidered that Bonapartists, Bourbons, and Orleanists were all out of\r\nthe question for the time being, and that a Republic was the only\r\npossible solution under existing circumstances. To put it shortly,\r\nhe had started on his mission through Europe in order to obtain\r\nintervention, and had began with England in order to persuade her if\r\npossible to use her moral influence in securing peace. This application\r\nwas supported by much high-sounding rhetoric on the subject of the\r\nancient friendship between England and France, and of the necessity of\r\nthe former retaining her due ascendency in the Councils of Europe, etc.,\r\netc., etc. Exhausted at the conclusion of his eloquent arguments, he\r\nwent to sleep, as recorded by Lord Granville, without waiting to listen\r\nto the latter's reply, and the really practical part of the conversation\r\nseems to have been the suggestion that the way should be paved by the\r\nBritish Government for an interview between Jules Favre and Bismarck.\r\n\r\nOn the next day Thiers proposed that H.M. Government should at once\r\nrecognize the Republic; but to this Lord Granville demurred, on the\r\nground that it would be contrary to precedent, and that the Republic\r\nhad at present no legal sanction, because no Constituent Assembly had\r\nyet decided on the future government of the country.\r\n\r\nUpon the occasion of a third interview, Thiers's arguments seem to have\r\nbeen still more forcible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, Sept. 16, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I called again on M. Thiers at his request to-day. He thanked me for\r\n    the letter which I had written to Bernstorff, although he thought it\r\n    might have been in warmer terms.\r\n\r\n    He informed me of his plan to go to Petersburg, by France, Turin and\r\n    Vienna. He said that by that way he should be within reach of\r\n    telegraphic and other news, and could be recalled, if wanted. He\r\n    should go back if his concurrence was absolutely necessary to the\r\n    conclusion of peace. He admitted that it would be most painful to\r\n    sign any peace at this time; that M. Jules Favre, on the contrary,\r\n    did not dislike the notion of it.\r\n\r\n    He spoke sanguinely of the defence of Paris: he counted the number\r\n    of armed men and the completeness of the ordnance. He gave some\r\n    credence to the report of General Bazaine's bold march. He then came\r\n    back to the subject of England's apathy: he dwelt upon the loss to\r\n    her dignity; the danger to her and to all Europe of the immense\r\n    preponderance of Germany. Austria must lose her German provinces.\r\n    What would not 60,000,000 Germans do, led by such a man as Bismarck?\r\n    I told him that I would not further discuss that matter with him,\r\n    and that his arguments went further than his demands. They were in\r\n    favour of an armed intervention. I had no doubt of what public\r\n    opinion here was on that point. He spoke of the sad task he had\r\n    undertaken, at his age, to go from Court to Court, almost as a\r\n    mendicant, for support to his country. I told him that it was most\r\n    honourable to him at his age, and after his long public life, to\r\n    undertake a task in which it was thought that he might be of use,\r\n    and that he ought not to be discontented with his mission here. He\r\n    could hardly have hoped, even with his ability, to change the\r\n    deliberate course of policy which H.M. Government had adopted, and\r\n    which they had announced to Parliament. But his second object, that\r\n    of explaining the necessity at this moment of the present Government\r\n    in France, and of the merits of M. Favre and General Trochu, and its\r\n    leading members, had had much effect upon me, and upon others with\r\n    whom he had conversed. We had also during his presence here arranged\r\n    the possibility of a meeting between M. Favre and Count Bismarck,\r\n    which if it took place (about which I was not sanguine) must, in any\r\n    case, be of some use.\r\n\r\n    We parted in a most friendly manner.\r\n\r\nThe offer to sound Bismarck on the question of receiving Jules Favre\r\nwas enthusiastically received by the latter, who had a strong personal\r\nfeeling on the subject. As, however, he had just concocted the\r\ncelebrated proclamation that France would never consent to yield 'a\r\nstone of her fortresses or an inch of her territory,' he could hardly be\r\nsaid to approach the question of peace in a practical spirit, nor did he\r\nreceive much assistance from his countrymen in general, for at that\r\nperiod no Frenchman could be found who was willing to admit openly the\r\npossibility of a cession of territory, whatever opinions may have been\r\nentertained in secret. Shrewder judges than Jules Favre, who, although\r\nable and honest, was too emotional for diplomatic work, suspected, with\r\nreason, that Bismarck was determined not to negotiate through neutrals,\r\nand not to negotiate at all except under the walls of Paris or in Paris\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe emissary appointed to approach Bismarck was Malet, who was selected\r\nbecause he was discreet, knew German well, and was already acquainted\r\nwith Bismarck, but no sooner had he been despatched than the Austrian\r\nAmbassador, Metternich, announced that he had received authority from\r\nVienna to go in company with his colleagues to the Prussian\r\nHeadquarters. Efforts were made to stop Malet, but fortunately without\r\nsuccess, and the private letter from the latter (extracts of which have\r\nalready been published) recounting his interview, is a singularly\r\ngraphic and interesting presentment of Bismarck's real disposition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Malet to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Paris, September 17, 1870.\r\n\r\n    During my two interviews with Count Bismarck on the 15th he said\r\n    some things which it may not be uninteresting to Your Lordship to\r\n    know although from the confidential familiar manner in which they\r\n    were uttered, I did not feel justified in including them in an\r\n    official report.\r\n\r\n    He stated it was the intention to hang all persons not in uniform\r\n    who were found with arms. A man in a blouse had been brought before\r\n    him who had represented that he was one of the Garde Mobile: Count\r\n    Bismarck decided that as there was nothing in his dress to support\r\n    his assertion he must be hung, and the sentence was forthwith\r\n    carried into effect. His Excellency added, 'I attach little value to\r\n    human life because I believe in another world--if we lived for three\r\n    or four hundred years it would be a different matter.' I said that\r\n    although some of the Mobile wore blouses, each regiment was dressed\r\n    in a uniform manner and that they all bore red collars and stripes\r\n    on their wristbands. His Excellency replied that that was not\r\n    enough, at a distance they looked like peasants and until they had\r\n    a dress like other soldiers those who were taken would be hung.\r\n\r\n    He said. 'When you were a little boy you wanted your mother to ask a\r\n    lady, who was not of the best position in society, to one of her\r\n    parties, your mother refused on which you threw yourself on the\r\n    ground and said you would not rise till you had got what you wanted.\r\n    In like manner we have thrown ourselves on the soil of France and\r\n    will not rise till our terms are agreed to.' In speaking of the\r\n    surrender of the Emperor he observed, 'When I approached the\r\n    carriage in which the Emperor was His Majesty took off his cap to\r\n    salute me. It is not the custom for us when in uniform to do more\r\n    than touch the cap--however I took mine off and the Emperor's eyes\r\n    followed it till it came on a level with my belt in which was a\r\n    revolver when he turned quite pale--I cannot account for it. He\r\n    could not suppose I was going to use it but the fact of his changing\r\n    colour was quite unmistakable. I was surprised that he should have\r\n    sent for me, I should have thought I was the last person that he\r\n    would wish to receive him because he has betrayed me. All that has\r\n    passed between us made me feel confident that he would not go to war\r\n    with Germany. He was bound not to do so and his doing it was an act\r\n    of personal treachery to me. The Emperor frequently asked whether\r\n    his carriages were safe out of Sedan, and a change indicating a\r\n    sense of great relief came over him when he received news of their\r\n    arrival in our lines.' M. de Bismarck talked in the most\r\n    contemptuous terms of M. de Gramont, allowing him only one merit\r\n    that of being a good shot. He touched on the publication of the\r\n    secret treaty, but his arguments in defence of it were rather too\r\n    subtle for me to seize them clearly. He said the secret should have\r\n    died with him had France had a tolerable pretext for going to war,\r\n    but that he considered her outrageous conduct in this matter\r\n    released him from all obligation.\r\n\r\n    'If,' he remarked, 'a man asks the hand of my daughter in marriage\r\n    and I refuse it I should consider it a matter of honour to keep the\r\n    proposal a secret as long as he behaved well to me, but if he\r\n    attacked me I should be no longer bound. This is quite a different\r\n    question from that of publishing a secret proposition at the same\r\n    time that you refuse it; you must be a Beust or an Austrian to do\r\n    that.'\r\n\r\n    In talking of the scheme to replace the Emperor on the throne by the\r\n    aid of Bazaine and the French Prisoners in Germany, I asked whether\r\n    His Majesty was now in a state of health to be willing to undertake\r\n    such a work. He answered that he never in his life had seen the\r\n    Emperor in the enjoyment of better health and he attributed it to\r\n    the bodily exercise and the diet which late events had forced upon\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    Count Bismarck spoke of Italy and appeared to think that it was in\r\n    immediate danger of Republican revolution. He said 'If,' as appeared\r\n    likely at the beginning, 'Italy had sided with France such a\r\n    movement would have broken out at once; we had everything prepared,\r\n    and could have forced on a revolution within three days after a\r\n    declaration of war.'\r\n\r\n    On leaving him he asked me if I had a horse, saying, 'I would offer\r\n    you mine but the French are in the habit of firing on our\r\n    Parlementaires and as I have only one I cannot afford to lose it.'\r\n\r\nFrom the French point of view there was very little encouragement to\r\nbe derived from these frank and even brutal opinions, but one result\r\nof some importance was obtained, for at the close of the interview,\r\nBismarck intimated to Malet 'as a friend' that if a member of the\r\nGovernment of National Defence chose to come he would be happy to\r\nreceive him, and added that he need feel no anxiety as to the nature of\r\nhis reception. Upon returning to Paris, Malet gave this message to Jules\r\nFavre at the British Embassy, and although the latter said nothing at\r\nthe moment, he proceeded shortly afterwards to Ferrières, where the\r\ncelebrated interview took place, and the opportunity of making peace on\r\neasy terms was thrown away, for 'as an old friend' Bismarck had also\r\nassured Malet that the Prussians were not going to ask for Alsace or\r\nLorraine, but only for Strasburg and Metz, as a precaution against\r\nfuture attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [17] As Minister for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n  [18] French Ambassador at Berlin.\r\n\r\n  [19] 'The Life of Lord Granville.'\r\n\r\n  [20] Bavarian Minister.\r\n\r\n  [21] Prussian Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n  [22] Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE\r\n\r\n(1870-1871)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investment of Paris being now imminent, the Diplomatists had to make\r\nup their minds as to whether they should remain or leave, and the latter\r\ncourse was adopted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Tours, Sept. 19, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I was a good deal put out at having to leave Paris. The interest is\r\n    still there: there was no danger in staying, and of course the\r\n    Diplomatists could have got the Prussians to let them through the\r\n    lines. But as soon as Jules Favre himself advised that I should go,\r\n    I had nothing to say to my colleagues of the Great Powers, whom I\r\n    had withstood, not without difficulty, for some time. At all events\r\n    I could not have stayed if they went, without exposing myself to all\r\n    kinds of misrepresentation, and presenting myself to the public and\r\n    Foreign Powers as the special partisan and adviser of the present\r\n    French Government. The Representatives of the small Powers, or most\r\n    of them, want to be able to go home when they leave Paris, and are\r\n    very much afraid of the expense and difficulty of finding lodgings\r\n    here. Well they may be: I myself spent eight hours yesterday walking\r\n    about or sitting on a trunk in the porte cochère of the hotel, and\r\n    have at last, in order not to pass the night _à la belle étoile_,\r\n    had to come to a house out of the town.\r\n\r\n    I don't expect much from Jules Favre's interview with Bismarck, but\r\n    I am very impatient to know whether he was received, and if so, what\r\n    passed. I should be glad that Bismarck should distinctly announce\r\n    his terms, though I can hardly hope they will be such as France will\r\n    accept now. But it would be well, whatever they are, that the French\r\n    should know them, and thus get their minds accustomed to them, and\r\n    so know also what amount of resistance is better than yielding to\r\n    them. I myself think that the loss of territory and the humiliation\r\n    of France and the great diminution of her power and influence would\r\n    be great evils and great sources of danger: but, if we can have no\r\n    means of preventing them, I am certainly anxious that we should not\r\n    aggravate them by holding out hopes that our mediation could effect\r\n    a change, or rather by allowing the hopes to be formed, which the\r\n    mere fact of our mediating could not but give rise to. I have read\r\n    with great interest the accounts of your conversations with Thiers,\r\n    and have been still more interested by your correspondence with\r\n    Bernstorff on 'benevolent neutrality.' On his part it is just the\r\n    old story I used to hear in America from the Northerners: 'The\r\n    ordinary rules of neutrality are very well in ordinary wars, such\r\n    as those in which we were neutrals, but our present cause is so\r\n    pre-eminently just, noble and advantageous to humanity and the rest\r\n    of the world, that the very least other nations can do is to strain\r\n    the laws of neutrality, so as to make them operate in our favour and\r\n    against our opponents.'\r\n\r\n    Thiers himself was expected here yesterday. Jules Favre did not\r\n    say positively that he was coming here himself, but he gave me to\r\n    understand that it was not improbable he should do so. He must make\r\n    haste, for we hear that the railway we came by is already broken up,\r\n    and all the others were impassable before.\r\n\r\nAs Lord Lyons's departure from Paris to Tours was practically the only\r\naction in the course of his career which was subjected to anything like\r\nunfavourable criticism, it is desirable to point out that as far back as\r\nAugust 31, Lord Granville had written to him in these words: 'I\r\npresume that your post will be with the Government as long as it is\r\nacknowledged; and that if the Empress and her Foreign Minister go to\r\nLyons or elsewhere, you would go too.' It is almost inconceivable that\r\nany one should have advocated the retention of the Ambassador in Paris\r\nafter that city had been cut off from the outside world; some of the\r\nmembers of the Government, it is true, including Jules Favre remained\r\nthere, but the _de facto_ Government of the country was temporarily\r\nestablished at Tours, and when Tours seemed likely to share the fate of\r\nParis, the Government was transferred to Bordeaux. It was so obviously\r\nthe duty of diplomatists to remain in touch with the French Government\r\nthat the wonder is that any objection should ever have been raised, and,\r\nas has already been narrated, Lord Lyons had been urged to move long\r\nbefore he would consent to do so. The action of the Ambassador was the\r\nsubject of an attack upon him subsequently in Parliament by the late Sir\r\nRobert Peel, which proved singularly ineffective.\r\n\r\nFew people had anticipated much result from Jules Favre's visit to\r\nBismarck, and when the latter insisted upon a surrender of territory\r\nbeing accepted in principle, the French envoy burst into tears.\r\nAccording to Bismarck this display of emotion was entirely artificial,\r\nand he even accused Jules Favre of having painted his face grey and\r\ngreen in order to excite sympathy, but in any case it became perfectly\r\nplain that no agreement was in sight and that the war would have to\r\ncontinue. In justice to the French it must be said that Bismarck seemed\r\nto have made his terms as harsh in form as they were stringent in\r\nsubstance, and it was difficult to conceive any Government subscribing\r\nto his conditions; as for poor Jules Favre he had to console himself by\r\nissuing a stirring address to his fellow-countrymen.\r\n\r\nAlthough the French public naturally began to display some impatience\r\nand irritation at the slowness with which 'Victory' was being organized,\r\nand to talk of Carnot, the old Republic, and the necessity of a Red\r\nRepublic if heroes were to be produced, the Tours Government continued\r\nto hold its own fairly well; there was little trouble about the\r\nfinances; disorders were suppressed, and the arrival of Gambetta infused\r\na good deal of energy into the administration. After the manner of\r\nFrench statesmen, Gambetta, upon his arrival at Tours, issued a spirited\r\nproclamation, announcing _inter alia_ that Paris was impregnable, and\r\nexplaining that as the form of Government had changed from a shameful\r\nand corrupt autocracy to a pure and unsullied Republic, success was a\r\nmoral certainty. Gambetta, who had assumed the office of Minister of\r\nWar, summoned to his assistance the veteran Garibaldi, and the arrival\r\nof the former obviously embarrassed the peace-loving diplomatists, who\r\nexpressed regret that his balloon had not capsized on the way from\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of October, however, the French Government began to show\r\nsigns of wiser dispositions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Tours. Oct. 16, 1870.\r\n\r\n    As you will see by my long despatch of to-day, I went yesterday with\r\n    the Comte de Chaudordy[23] into the questions of the '_pouce de notre\r\n    territoire_' and the '_pierres de nos forteresses_.' The fortresses\r\n    have in point of fact been tacitly abandoned for a long time,\r\n    provided the dismantling them only, not the cession of them to\r\n    Prussia is demanded.\r\n\r\n    M. de Chaudordy said that he would tell me what was in the bottom of\r\n    his heart about the cession of territory, if I would promise to\r\n    report it to your Lordship only in such a form as would ensure it\r\n    never being published now or hereafter, or even being quoted or\r\n    referred to.\r\n\r\n    Having received my promise and taken all these precautions, he said\r\n    that he did not regard some cession of territory as altogether out\r\n    of the question. The men at present in office certainly could not\r\n    retreat from their positive declaration that they would never yield\r\n    an inch of territory; but if the interests of France appeared to\r\n    require positively that the sacrifice should be made, they would\r\n    retire from office, and give place to men who were unshackled, and\r\n    not only would they abstain from opposing such men, but would give\r\n    them full support in signing a peace, which, however painful,\r\n    appeared to be necessary. M. de Chaudordy was convinced and indeed\r\n    had reason to know that the men now in office had patriotism enough\r\n    to act in this way in case of need, but he could not authorize me to\r\n    tell you this as a communication from the individuals themselves,\r\n    much less as a communication from the French Government. It would be\r\n    ruin to the men themselves and to the cause, if it should transpire\r\n    that such an idea had ever been contemplated at a moment like this.\r\n    For it to be carried into effect with any success, it must appear to\r\n    rise at the critical time out of the necessities of the hour.\r\n\r\n    He concluded by reminding me of my promise that what he had said\r\n    should never be published or even referred to.\r\n\r\n    I thanked him for the confidence he had placed in me, and assured\r\n    him that he need not have the least fear that it would be abused. I\r\n    said however at the same time that he must feel, as I did, that\r\n    however useful it might be to be aware of the disposition he had\r\n    mentioned, as entertained by the men in power, it would be very\r\n    difficult for a Government to make information, given with so much\r\n    reserve, the foundation of any positive measures.\r\n\r\nThis criticism was sufficiently obvious. If the information was never to\r\ngo beyond Lord Lyons and Lord Granville, of what practical use could it\r\nbe? It can only be supposed that those who sent Chaudordy, intended that\r\nhis confidential communication should somehow or other reach the\r\nPrussian Government.\r\n\r\nHard upon Chaudordy, followed a man destined before long to achieve a\r\nmelancholy celebrity, General Bourbaki. General Bourbaki had been the\r\nvictim of a strange mystification, which resulted in his being permitted\r\nto leave Metz upon a secret mission to the Empress at Chislehurst, and\r\nwhen it was discovered that the whole thing was an ingenious fraud\r\nperpetrated by one Regnier (probably with the connivance of Bismarck),\r\nand that the Empress had never sent for him at all, he returned to\r\nFrance, but was not permitted to re-enter Metz. Consequently, he\r\nrepaired to Tours and gave the Ambassador the benefit of his views.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bourbaki, as a professional soldier, took a most gloomy view of\r\nthe military situation. He did not think that an army capable of coping\r\nwith the Prussians in the field in anything like equal numbers could be\r\nformed in less than five or six months, even with first-rate military\r\norganizers at the head of affairs, instead of the present inexperienced\r\ncivilians. According to him, the Army of Metz was in admirable condition\r\nand might perhaps break out, but even so, where was it to go? Its\r\nprovisions and ammunition would be exhausted long before it could get to\r\nany place where they could be replenished. As the surrender of Paris was\r\nreally only a question of time, the most prudent thing to do would be to\r\nmake peace whilst those two fortresses were still holding out, and it\r\nwould be to the interest of Prussia to do so, because if Metz fell,\r\nBazaine's army would disappear, and there would be no Government left in\r\nFrance with whom it would be possible to treat, and the Prussians would,\r\ntherefore, be forced to administer the country as well as occupy it. The\r\nProvisional Government, who must have had a high opinion of Bourbaki,\r\noffered him the title of Commander-in-Chief and the command of the Army\r\nof the Loire, but he declined the honour on the ground that he would not\r\nbe given unlimited military powers, and that nothing could be effected\r\nunder the orders of civilians absolutely devoid of military capacity.\r\n\r\nAnother visitor was M. Daniel Wilson, who achieved a sinister notoriety\r\nduring the Presidency of M. Grévy in connection with the alleged sale of\r\nhonours, etc. Wilson's object was to urge the desirability of summoning\r\na Constituent Assembly without delay, as he and his moderate friends\r\nwere convinced that such a body would be in favour of peace. He himself\r\nconsidered the prosecution of the war under existing circumstances to be\r\na crime, and he was not disposed to allow the six or seven men who had\r\nseized upon the Government, to achieve the ruin of France. Their only\r\nexcuse for postponing the elections was the difficulty of holding them\r\nin the districts occupied by the Prussians, but if an armistice could be\r\nobtained, that difficulty would disappear, and an armistice of only\r\nfifteen days would make the resumption of hostilities impossible. The\r\ninterest attaching to this visit lay in the fact that a peace party was\r\nnow actually in existence, whereas the Provisional Government at Tours,\r\nthe Ministers left in Paris, and the advanced Republicans seemed to\r\nbe still fully bent upon war _à outrance_, and as little willing as\r\never to hear of a cession of territory.\r\n\r\nBazaine capitulated on October 27, and shortly afterwards Thiers who had\r\nreturned to Paris from his circular tour round the Courts of Europe\r\nproceeded to the Prussian Headquarters to discuss with Bismarck the\r\nquestion of an armistice, a course of action which the Provisional\r\nGovernment had agreed to, provided it were initiated by a third party.\r\nThe attitude, however, of Gambetta and his friends did not encourage\r\nmuch hope of success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Tours, Oct. 31, 1870.\r\n\r\n    Gambetta's Proclamation and the language Chaudordy has again been\r\n    directed to hold about cession of territory, will show you how vain\r\n    it is to try to induce these people to give a negotiation a fair\r\n    chance by abstaining during the course of it from violent and\r\n    imprudent language.\r\n\r\n    Nothing can look worse for France than things do at this moment. A\r\n    reign of terror, perseverance in hostilities until the country is\r\n    utterly ruined, a dissolution of all order and discipline in the\r\n    army, and a total disorganization of society might seem to be\r\n    threatened. I take comfort from the thought that much allowance must\r\n    be made for the first ebullition of grief and rage at the surrender\r\n    of Bazaine, and that some of Gambetta's fire and fury may be\r\n    intended to divert blame from himself for a catastrophe which he did\r\n    nothing to prevent. Anyhow things are gloomy enough, and I am\r\n    nervous and uneasy about Thiers and his mission, and should be glad\r\n    to hear that he was at least safe out of Paris again.\r\n\r\nThe news of the capitulation of Metz was at once followed by an\r\nunsuccessful outbreak against the Government in Paris, headed by the\r\nwell-known revolutionary, Gustave Flourens, who seized the Ministers and\r\nproclaimed the Commune at the Hotel de Ville. The Ministers, however,\r\nwere shortly liberated by the Garde Mobile and National Guards and order\r\nwas restored without much difficulty in the course of a few hours.\r\nFlourens, who was subsequently shot by the Versailles troops during the\r\nsuppression of the Commune in 1871, was generally regarded as the most\r\nformidable 'man of action,' and had lately been residing in London. It\r\nis interesting to record the impression which the wasted potentialities\r\nof England made upon this impartial visitor. _Me voici, avec mes amis\r\nFélix Pyat et Louis Blanc à Londres, dans ce pays d'Angleterre qui\r\npourrait être si grand à condition de n'avoir point ni les Lords ni la\r\nBible!_ One almost wishes that he had been spared to witness the\r\noperation of the Parliament Act.\r\n\r\nThe Paris Government, adroitly profiting by the overthrow of Flourens\r\nand his friends, at once organized a plébiscite in the city, and emerged\r\ntriumphantly with over 500,000 votes recorded in their favour as against\r\n60,000 dissentients. This was all to the good, as it showed that\r\nmoderate opinions were still in the ascendency, and whereas the fall of\r\nMetz was at first received with frantic cries of rage and war to the\r\nknife, people began to look a little more calmly on its effect on the\r\nmilitary situation, and hopes were entertained that the mission of\r\nThiers to Bismarck, which had been promoted by Her Majesty's Government,\r\nwould result in the conclusion of an armistice. These hopes were doomed\r\nto disappointment, for after several interviews at Versailles, during\r\nthe course of which an agreement for some time appeared probable,\r\nnegotiations were finally broken off on the question of revictualling\r\nthe various fortresses, more especially Paris.\r\n\r\nThiers, who had repaired to Tours after the failure of his efforts, gave\r\nLord Lyons in strict confidence a full and interesting account of his\r\nnegotiations with Bismarck.\r\n\r\nAt the first important interview, which took place at Versailles on\r\nNovember 1, no serious objection was raised to the proposals of the\r\nFrench Government, and after a conversation which lasted two or three\r\nhours, Thiers took his leave with good hopes for the success of the\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\nThe second conference, on the following day, passed equally\r\nsatisfactorily. On Thursday, the 3rd, Bismarck kept Thiers waiting a\r\nshort time, and said that he had been detained at a military meeting\r\nheld by the King. He seemed annoyed and irritable, and indeed on one\r\noccasion, quite lost his temper. Nevertheless, Thiers resenting this, he\r\napologized and assumed a civil and indeed caressing demeanour. He\r\nasserted that _les militaires_, as he always called them, made\r\nobjections to the proposed revictualling of Paris and that they also had\r\nsome reservations to make with respect to the suggested elections. _Les\r\nmilitaires_ also urged that if, as proposed, Paris were to be\r\nprovisioned during twenty-five days' armistice, those days would be\r\nabsolutely lost to the German arms, and the surrender of the town\r\ndeferred for at least that time. On being sounded as to what might be\r\nconsidered an equivalent, it appeared that two or more of the detached\r\nforts, or some other concession equally inadmissible, would be demanded.\r\nOn finding, therefore, that Bismarck was unshaken in declaring that\r\npositively _les militaires_ would not allow Paris to be revictualled,\r\nThiers had no alternative but to withdraw from the negotiation and to\r\nrequest facilities for communicating the result to the Government in\r\nParis. _Les militaires_, it will be observed, played much the same\r\nconvenient part in this affair as the King of Prussia in the arguments\r\nused against Lord Clarendon's secret disarmament proposals.\r\n\r\nUpon the Paris Government becoming acquainted with these terms, Jules\r\nFavre directed Thiers to break off the negotiations and leave Versailles\r\nimmediately; a decision which Bismarck stated caused him great regret\r\nand induced him to suggest that elections should be held even while\r\nhostilities were going on. He made no offer, however, of any concession\r\nwith regard to the revictualling of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion which Thiers arrived at was that there was both a\r\npolitical and a military party at the Prussian Headquarters. The\r\npolitical party, with which Bismarck himself to a great extent agreed,\r\nwas desirous of bringing the war to an end by concluding peace on\r\ncomparatively moderate terms. The military party held that the glory of\r\nthe Prussian arms and the future security of Germany demanded that the\r\nrights of war should be pushed to the utmost, and that France should be\r\nlaid waste, ruined, and humiliated to such a degree as to render it\r\nimpossible for her to wage war again with Germany for very many years.\r\nHe could not, however, discover even among the most moderate of the\r\nso-called political party any one who seemed to ask less than the\r\ncession of Alsace and of that part of Lorraine in which German is\r\nspoken. It seems clear that Bismarck impressed Thiers with his sincerity\r\nat the commencement of the negotiations, and with the belief that he was\r\nsubsequently overruled by _les militaires_, but whenever it was\r\nsuggested that the armistice had been proposed to both parties by the\r\nneutral Powers, Bismarck showed much 'impatience and annoyance.' He\r\nshowed Thiers the letters which the Emperor Alexander had written to the\r\nKing of Prussia. They were 'warm, earnest letters,' but written as from\r\na friend to a friend, without in the least assuming the tone of a\r\nsovereign addressing a brother sovereign on a matter concerning the\r\nrelations of their respective Governments. Of Great Britain, it is sad\r\nto learn, he spoke with 'special ill-humour.' One subject upon which he\r\ntouched is not without interest at the present day. He complained\r\nbitterly of the treatment to which the crews of captured German merchant\r\nvessels were subjected, and said that he should give orders to have an\r\nequal number of French non-combatants arrested and treated in the same\r\nway. When it was mildly suggested that this would hardly be in\r\naccordance with international maritime law, he exclaimed with some\r\nviolence: 'Who made the code of maritime law? You and the English,\r\nbecause you are powerful at sea, it is no code at all, it is simply the\r\nlaw of the strongest!' To this Thiers appears to have retorted that he,\r\nBismarck, did not on all occasions seem disposed to repudiate the law of\r\nthe strongest.\r\n\r\nSo far as the convocation of a National Assembly was concerned Bismarck\r\nalleged complete indifference, explaining that he had now two\r\nGovernments with which to treat, one at Paris, and the other at\r\nWilhelmshöhe, and although he expressed unmitigated contempt for the\r\nEmperor Napoleon, he was nevertheless quite ready to make use of him\r\nto attain his ends.\r\n\r\nDuring the fruitless negotiations which had taken place, first when\r\nconducted by Jules Favre, and secondly when conducted by Thiers, the\r\nBritish Government found itself in a somewhat embarrassing position. It\r\nwas perfectly sincere in desiring to bring about peace between France\r\nand Prussia, but it was unwilling to identify itself with the one\r\nproposal which would have had that effect, viz. the cession of\r\nterritory, and the perplexity in which the English Ministers found\r\nthemselves is illustrated by a letter from Mr. Gladstone to Lord Lyons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    11, Carlton House Terrace, Nov. 7, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I have seen your letter to Lord Granville in which you notice that\r\n    in a note to him I had expressed a hope you would not allow the\r\n    French to suppose we adopted their view as to integrity of\r\n    territory.\r\n\r\n    I do not recollect the exact words to which you may refer, but I\r\n    write a line lest I should by chance have conveyed a false\r\n    impression.\r\n\r\n    At an earlier stage of this tremendous controversy, the French took\r\n    their stand upon inviolability of soil. That ground always seemed to\r\n    me quite untenable in the case of a country which had made recent\r\n    annexations.\r\n\r\n    The French also declared that they would surrender neither an inch\r\n    of their territory nor a stone of their fortresses. This appeared to\r\n    me an extravagant proposition, and, what is more important, I\r\n    venture to say it was thought unreasonable by my colleagues and by\r\n    the country generally. It is possible that my note may have referred\r\n    to either of these views on the part of France.\r\n\r\n    But I am very sorry if I have conveyed to you on my own part, or by\r\n    implication on the part of any one else, the belief that we approved\r\n    of, or were in our own minds indifferent to the transfer of\r\n    Alsatians and Lorrainers from France to Germany against their will.\r\n\r\n    On this subject, I for one, entirely concur with the opinions you\r\n    have so admirably expressed in your letter, and I should be to the\r\n    last degree reluctant to be a party not only to stimulating a German\r\n    demand of this kind, but even to advising or promoting a compliance\r\n    with it on the part of France.\r\n\r\n    All this you will see is quite distinct from and consistent with the\r\n    desire which you and which we all entertain that the Defence\r\n    Government of France should not needlessly deal in abstract\r\n    declarations, and with a full approval of your reticence as to the\r\n    conditions of peace.\r\n\r\n    On the failure of the armistice I think the Cabinet will disperse,\r\n    as having nothing more to consider in the present circumstances. I\r\n    cannot help feeling doubtful whether the Prussians do not lose more\r\n    than the French by the unhappy failure of the negotiations.\r\n\r\n    We are all more grieved at the failure than surprised.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to read much meaning into the above involved epistle.\r\nHow, for instance, could any fortresses be surrendered without Alsatians\r\nand Lorrainers being handed over to Prussia? Put into plain language,\r\nthe letter presumably meant that H.M. Government was anxious to remain\r\nfriends with both sides, but was afraid to make the one recommendation\r\nto the French which would have been of any use, and hoped that the\r\nproposal of a cession of territory would eventually be made on the\r\nlatter's initiative.\r\n\r\nThiers, who in the course of his tour round the capitals of Europe had\r\nvigorously denounced (especially to the Italians) the apathy and\r\nselfishness of England, now intimated to the Ambassador that he was\r\nwilling to go back to London if he could contribute, by so doing, to\r\nbring about an armistice and a peace, but received no encouragement;\r\npartly because it was thought that the less the British Government\r\ndid, which appeared to be prompted by France, the more Bismarck might be\r\ninclined to yield, and partly because it would cause irritation in\r\nFrance, if Thiers made another formal expedition to England without\r\nproducing any marked result.\r\n\r\nA momentary elation was just about this time produced at Tours by the\r\nvictory of General d'Aurelle des Paladines and the recapture of Orleans,\r\nbut Gambetta does not appear to have lost his head in consequence of\r\nthis temporary success or to have attached undue importance to it.\r\nGambetta's opinion was that France could hold out for four months, and\r\nthat the Germans would not be able to stay so long in the country. He\r\ntold Lord Lyons that he approved of the armistice on the terms proposed\r\nby the Government of Paris, and implied that he did, rather than not,\r\napprove of the readiness of that Government to conclude one still, if\r\nthrough the representations of the neutrals Prussia should yet be\r\nbrought to consent to reasonable terms for one. He manifested great\r\nindignation at Bismarck's contention that there was no Government in\r\nFrance, maintained that the Government of National Defence was a\r\nproperly constituted Government entitled to exercise all the powers of\r\nthe nation, and said that there was no need whatever of a Constitutional\r\nAssembly. As for General d'Aurelle des Paladines, his hour of triumph\r\nwas soon terminated; the Prussians drove him out of Orleans, and his\r\nfailure was ascribed by the Republicans to his action in proceeding to\r\nvenerate some relics in the Orleans cathedral.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Mr. Gladstone's Government found themselves confronted\r\nwith a difficulty which had to some extent been foreseen, but which was\r\nentirely unexpected at that particular moment. In the beginning of\r\nNovember, Prince Gortschakoff issued a circular denouncing the clauses\r\nof the Treaty of Paris which related to the Black Sea. Lord Granville\r\ncommunicated the intelligence in a letter to Lord Lyons dated November\r\n11.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, Nov. 11, 1870.\r\n\r\n    The shell has fallen suddenly. I expected it, but not in so abrupt a\r\n    form. If it was to come, I am not sure that I regret the way it has\r\n    done. Do not communicate officially my answer till the Russian\r\n    Government has received theirs: the messenger leaves London\r\n    to-night.\r\n\r\n    I am curious to hear what the Provisional Government will say. I\r\n    presume they will try to make a bargain on the subject. You will of\r\n    course explain to them that it is, at the very least, a more serious\r\n    subject for them than for us.\r\n\r\n    The handling of the matter is delicate and difficult. We are\r\n    unanimous about the first step, more in doubt about the next.\r\n\r\n    If Bernstorff gets permission to give a safe conduct to Odo Russell,\r\n    we mean to send him to-morrow to Versailles with our answer and a\r\n    private letter from me to Bismarck. I presume there is a private\r\n    understanding between Russia and Prussia, but it is not certain;\r\n    Bernstorff as usual was dumb, but intimated his surprise at the\r\n    form.\r\n\r\n    He tells me that my question will be met with a negative as to\r\n    provisioning Paris: the Generals will not hear of it. If so, I shall\r\n    ask whether he will still give facilities for an election without an\r\n    armistice, and then I shall request you to press the expediency of\r\n    summoning a Chamber on the Provisional Government--always declaring\r\n    that you do not wish to interfere with the self-government of\r\n    France.\r\n\r\nWhy it should have been assumed that the action of the Russian Government\r\nwas more serious as regards the French than ourselves, is not\r\nparticularly clear. Whatever the French Government may have said in\r\npublic on the subject, there can be little doubt that in secret they\r\nhailed it as a welcome diversion which might be turned to advantage. If\r\nit brought about a congress or conference, it might cause a stir amongst\r\nneutrals resulting in a check to Prussia as well as to Russia. The\r\ningenious Thiers at once grasped at the possibility of forming an\r\nEuropean Alliance against these two Powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Tours, Nov. 14, 1870.\r\n\r\n    Thiers has just paid me so long a visit that he has left me very\r\n    little time to write. His notion is that England, Austria, Italy,\r\n    Turkey and Spain should now unite with France to check the\r\n    aggression of Prussia and Russia, and he thinks that without war\r\n    this would lead to a Congress in which all Europe would settle the\r\n    terms of peace. If England lets the occasion go by, it will, in his\r\n    opinion, be she, not France, who will have sunk to the rank of a\r\n    second-rate Power. I thought my prudent course was to listen and say\r\n    nothing, which, as you know, is easy with him; for he talks too well\r\n    for one to be bored with him, and is quite content to talk without\r\n    interruption.\r\n\r\n    He had a violent argument with Chaudordy in the presence of\r\n    Metternich and me on the subject of the elections. Chaudordy\r\n    maintains the Government view that they are impossible without an\r\n    armistice. Thiers took the other side, and at last cried out: 'They\r\n    will at least be much more free under the Prussians than under\r\n    Gambetta's Prefects!'\r\n\r\nIn 'Bismarck, his Reflections and Reminiscences,' there occurs the\r\nsuggestive passage:--\r\n\r\n    'It was consequently a fortunate thing that the situation offered a\r\n    possibility of doing Russia a service in respect to the Black Sea.\r\n    Just as the sensibilities of the Russian Court, which owing to\r\n    the Russian relationship of Queen Mary were enlisted by the loss of\r\n    the Hanoverian Crown, found their counterpoise in the concessions\r\n    which were made to the Oldenburg connexions of the Russian dynasty\r\n    in territorial and financial directions in 1866; so did the\r\n    possibility occur in 1870 of doing a service not only to the\r\n    dynasty, but also to the Russian Empire.... We had in this an\r\n    opportunity of improving our relations with Russia.'\r\n\r\nThere can hardly be a shadow of a doubt that the denunciation of the\r\nBlack Sea clauses was what is vulgarly called a 'put up job' between\r\nBismarck and the Russian Government, probably arranged at Ems in the\r\nspring; but when Mr. Odo Russell made his appearance at Versailles in\r\norder to discuss the question, Bismarck assured him that the Russian\r\naction had not met with his sanction and added that the circular was\r\nill-timed and ill-advised. (In private, he subsequently expressed the\r\nopinion that the Russians had been much too modest in their demands and\r\nought to have asked for more.) As, however, the face of the British\r\nGovernment had to be saved somehow, a Conference in London was\r\nsuggested, and the efforts of Lord Granville were concentrated upon an\r\nattempt to persuade the Provisional Government of France to take part in\r\nit. This proved difficult, for the French made it clear that they were\r\nnot anxious to do so unless they could get some advantage out of it, and\r\nintimated that they meant to accept aid from any quarter where it might\r\nbe obtained--even from the 'Satanic Alliance,' as Thiers called it, of\r\nRussia. One of the difficulties encountered in dealing with the French\r\nGovernment arose from the discrepancy between language used in London by\r\nthe French Ambassador and that used by Chaudordy at Tours. The latter\r\nwas not a Minister and the Government consequently did not feel bound to\r\nsupport him. Chaudordy himself took advantage of his anomalous position\r\nto talk freely and to treat what he had said, according to\r\ncircumstances, as pledging or not pledging the Government, and, besides\r\nthis, the Government at Tours was liable to be disavowed by the\r\nGovernment at Paris.\r\n\r\nHow serious the situation was considered to be in London may be judged\r\nby the following two letters from Lord Granville to Lord Lyons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, Nov. 28, 1870.\r\n\r\n    Pray exert all your influence to obtain the assent of France to the\r\n    Conference. It will of course be an annoyance to her that peace\r\n    instead of war prevails, and there is no doubt that a general\r\n    conflagration might be of advantage to her. But you may point out\r\n    that the very nature of the question almost precludes instant and\r\n    offensive war, and that hostilities distant in point of time would\r\n    be nothing but an embarrassment to her.\r\n\r\n    With regard to the Diplomatic position, it is a great step for the\r\n    Provisional Government that Prussia has asked us to obtain her\r\n    consent to a Conference. On the other hand, it would be a severe\r\n    blow to the Provisional Government if they were left out in the\r\n    cold, while the other Powers were settling a question of so much\r\n    interest to France.\r\n\r\n    If such an unfortunate state of things were to occur, we should do\r\n    our best to protect the dignity of France, but it would be\r\n    difficult. Do not encourage France to suggest delay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, Nov. 30, 1870.\r\n\r\n    The French are unwisely playing the same game as they did under\r\n    Gramont about the Belgian Treaty. In each case, Bismarck had the\r\n    sense to do at once what was to be done.\r\n\r\n    It is an enormous step for the Provisional Government to be\r\n    recognized by Prussia, Austria, Turkey, Italy, and England as\r\n    capable of attending a Conference, and it will be very foolish of\r\n    them to lose the opportunity and remain out in the cold.\r\n\r\n    As London is the place, it would be my duty to issue the formal\r\n    invitations; at least I suppose so. Do your best to persuade them.\r\n\r\n    The Government here wish to hold their own, but are most desirous of\r\n    a prompt and peaceable solution of this 'Circular' question.\r\n\r\n    We shall adhere to anything we say, but you will observe that we are\r\n    not rash.\r\n\r\n    Turkey, Austria and Italy are not pleasant reeds to rest on.\r\n\r\n    If we go to war, we shall be very like the man with a pistol before\r\n    a crowd, _after_ he has fired it off. Do not let a pacific word,\r\n    however, escape your lips.\r\n\r\nThese two letters are a sufficiently clear indication of the highly\r\nuncomfortable position in which H.M. Government found itself involved,\r\nand of the urgent necessity of discovering some face-saving formula.\r\nFrance being incapacitated, it could hardly be supposed that Austria and\r\nItaly would go to war with Russia on account of a question whether\r\nRussia should or should not maintain a fleet in the Black Sea, and\r\nEngland with her ludicrous military establishments would therefore have\r\nbeen left to undertake the contest single-handed, or, at most, with the\r\nassistance of Turkey.\r\n\r\nUltimately, of course, a Black Sea Conference met in London, and a\r\nFrench representative, the Duc de Broglie, put in an appearance just as\r\nit was terminating, after ineffectual efforts had been made to secure\r\nthe presence of M. Jules Favre. Lord Fitzmaurice, in his 'Life of Lord\r\nGranville,' has elaborately endeavoured to show that the Conference\r\nresulted in a triumph for British diplomacy. If the acceptance of a\r\nparticular form of words (of which, by the way, no notice was taken by\r\nCount Aehrenthal when he annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in defiance of\r\nthe Treaty of Berlin), constitutes a success, then Mr. Gladstone's\r\nGovernment were entitled to congratulate themselves; but as the Russians\r\ngot their way and established their right to maintain a fleet in the\r\nBlack Sea, they could legitimately claim that for all practical purposes\r\nthe triumph was theirs.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his interviews with Thiers, Bismarck had denounced\r\nEngland, and before the end of 1870 the feeling between England and\r\nPrussia was anything but friendly. At the outbreak of hostilities\r\nBritish sympathy had been almost universally on the side of Prussia, but\r\nas the war progressed, public opinion began to veer round. The change in\r\nopinion was due partly to sympathy with a losing cause, partly to an\r\nimpression that the Prussians were inclined to put forward unjust and\r\nexaggerated demands, partly to the violent abuse which appeared in the\r\npress of both countries, as well as to a variety of other causes. A\r\nletter from Mr. Henry Wodehouse, one of the secretaries at the Paris\r\nEmbassy, shows that the Crown Prince of Prussia, whose Anglophil\r\nsympathies were well known, deplored the tone of the German papers, and\r\nalludes at the same time to a domestic squabble in high German circles,\r\nthus showing that the Prussian Government as well as the French was not\r\nentirely exempt from internal dissensions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Wodehouse to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Rouen, Nov. 16, 1870.\r\n\r\n    On Monday morning, before leaving Versailles, I had an interview\r\n    with the Crown Prince of Prussia at H.R.H.'s desire.\r\n\r\n    H.R.H. informed me that, at the last moment, when it was thought\r\n    that all was arranged for the Union of South Germany with the North\r\n    German Confederation, the Würtemberg Minister, instigated, it was\r\n    believed, by the Bavarian Government, had asked for a delay in order\r\n    to consult the other members of the Würtemberg Government, and had\r\n    started for Stuttgardt with this object. This sudden decision had\r\n    caused the King of Prussia and his Government very great annoyance.\r\n\r\n    H.R.H. spoke of the hostile tone lately adopted towards England by\r\n    the German press, which he assured me, was quite contrary to the\r\n    wishes of the Prussian Government, and that he himself much\r\n    regretted it, as he feared it would give rise to a spirit of\r\n    animosity between Prussia and England.\r\n\r\n    H.R.H. desired me to report this conversation to Lord Granville on\r\n    my arrival in England.\r\n\r\nAs was shown in the case of the American Civil War, it is extremely\r\ndifficult for a neutral to keep on good terms with both parties, however\r\nmuch it may be desired to preserve an absolutely impartial attitude. The\r\nFrench blamed us because they considered that we had not rendered them\r\nthe kind of assistance which they thought was due to them. The\r\nPrussians, on the other hand, were always discovering grievances which\r\nbetrayed our partiality. Upon the whole it is not surprising that our\r\nattitude provoked excessive irritation on their part, for we were\r\ncontinually harping on and deploring the iniquities of war, while\r\nperfectly ready to make a handsome profit out of it by selling anything\r\nto the belligerents. The late Sir Robert Morier admirably described the\r\nBritish attitude as it appeared to German eyes. \"We sit by like a\r\nbloated Quaker, too holy to fight, but rubbing our hands at the roaring\r\ntrade we are driving in cartridges and ammunition. We are heaping up to\r\nourselves the undying hatred of this German race, that will henceforth\r\nrule the world, because we cannot muster up courage to prevent a few\r\nBrummagem manufacturers from driving their unholy trade.\"[24] It is only\r\nfair to add, however, that German censure was confined to England; the\r\nAmericans, who exported arms in just the same way, were never denounced,\r\nbut possibly this was due to the fact that they assumed a less\r\nself-righteous attitude.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been Bismarck's private sentiments with regard to\r\nEngland, he was not unconciliatory in public, and the various\r\ndifficulties which arose were settled satisfactorily. One of the last\r\nunpleasant episodes was the sinking of several British merchant vessels\r\nin the Seine by the Prussian artillery towards the close of the year,\r\nfor which compensation was demanded, and a passage in Busch's 'Bismarck'\r\nshows his method of dealing with such matters. 'When the Germans, a\r\nshort time before the conclusion of the Preliminary Peace at Versailles,\r\nsank some English coal ships on the Lower Seine and the English made a\r\nrow on the subject, the chief asked me (Lothar Bucher), What can we say\r\nin reply? Well, I had brought with me some old fogies on the Law of\r\nNations and such matters. I hunted up what the old writers called the\r\nJus Angariæ, that is to say, the right to destroy the property of\r\nneutrals on payment of full compensation, and showed it to the chief. He\r\nsent me with it to Russell, who showed himself to be convinced by this\r\n\"good authority.\" Shortly afterwards the whole affair with the Jus\r\nAngariæ appeared in the _Times_. We wrote in the same sense to London,\r\nand the matter was settled.'\r\n\r\nMr. Odo Russell, whose presence at Versailles had been utilized to\r\nascertain what terms of peace were likely to be granted, wrote before\r\nthe middle of December that he was convinced that Bismarck would refuse\r\nto treat except upon the basis of unconditional surrender, and the\r\nfailure of the sorties from Paris and of the operations near Orleans\r\ncaused Thiers to lose heart, although Gambetta was as determined as ever\r\nto continue the struggle and to postpone the convocation of a National\r\nAssembly for as long as possible. Thiers indeed went so far as to\r\ndeclare in private to the Ambassador that further resistance was\r\nuseless, and that it was a crime as well as a folly to continue it. The\r\nlast disasters of the French, which were partly due to two shocking\r\npieces of bad luck--the balloon which should have brought Trochu's plan\r\nfor combined action with the Army of the Loire having been blown off to\r\nChristiania, and a sudden rise of the Marne having rendered co-operation\r\nwith General Vinoy impossible--forced the Tours Government and the\r\nDiplomatists to migrate to Bordeaux. An offer on the part of the Foreign\r\nOffice to send a warship to that port for the benefit of the Ambassador\r\nand his staff was declined with thanks: 'Under ordinary circumstances, I\r\nthink I am better without one, and indeed personally I should be much\r\nless afraid of the Prussians than of the Bay of Biscay.'\r\n\r\nIt used to be a tradition in after years that the sole perceptible\r\neffect of the Franco-German War upon the British Embassy was that Lord\r\nLyons's footmen ceased temporarily to powder their hair, but to judge by\r\na letter to Hammond, Ambassadors suffered inconveniences as well as\r\nhumbler people.\r\n\r\nIt is probable too that the social disorganization produced by the war\r\nprovided distinguished diplomatists, who are necessarily amongst the\r\nmost ceremonious of mankind, with some novel sensations. Upon one\r\noccasion, when Lord Lyons had occasion to call upon Gambetta, the\r\nDictator was too busy to see him for some minutes, and deputed a\r\nsubordinate to make his excuses. The latter began his conversation with\r\nthe remark: 'Allons boire un bock!' a hospitable invitation hardly in\r\naccordance with the traditions of conventional diplomacy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Mr. Hammond._\r\n\r\n    Bordeaux, Dec. 12, 1870.\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for the _Bradshaw_ and the _Times_, and very many more\r\n    for your letter of the 7th, which has just arrived by messenger.\r\n\r\n    Not having the archives here, I cannot look up the regulations about\r\n    the expenses of an Embassy on its travels, as this is now. What I am\r\n    anxious about is that some compensation should be made to the junior\r\n    members who are with me, for the additional expense they are put to\r\n    by their migration. I am willing to do anything I can for them, but\r\n    there are of course limits to what I can afford, and it would be\r\n    utterly repugnant to all my feelings and principles, for me to have\r\n    an allowance for entertaining them. In old times, when manners and\r\n    feelings were different, this might do; but in the present day the\r\n    position of an hotel keeper for his subordinates is destructive of\r\n    discipline and comfortable relations between a chief and the members\r\n    of his Embassy.\r\n\r\n    The difficulty of finding lodgings and the prices are much greater\r\n    than they were at Paris. I have nothing but one room for study,\r\n    drawing-room, bedroom and all; and have just been asked six hundred\r\n    pounds a month for one floor of a moderate sized house.\r\n\r\nThe junior members alluded to included Malet and Sheffield. It had, of\r\ncourse, been necessary to leave some of the staff at Paris.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Thiers's failure to obtain an armistice, the French\r\nGovernment still made strenuous efforts in the same direction and even\r\nsucceeded in pressing the Pope into their service. The latter broached\r\nthe subject to Count Arnim, the Prussian Minister at Rome, proposing\r\nthat the revictualling of Paris should be accepted as a basis, and\r\nreceived a severe snub for his pains. He was informed, 'in very harsh\r\nterms,' that the proposal could not be considered, and further, that it\r\nwas impossible to negotiate with a nation whose bad faith was\r\nscandalously exhibited by the daily appearance in arms of French\r\nofficers who had given their word of honour not to serve again during\r\nthe war. After much haggling, the French proposals resolved themselves\r\ninto three alternatives, each of which was categorically rejected by\r\nBismarck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Mr. Layard._[25]\r\n\r\n    Bordeaux, Dec. 20, 1870.\r\n\r\n    The difficulty of communication is between this place and England,\r\n    and arises from the utter irregularity of all trains, caused by the\r\n    movements of the troops. St. Malo has become the usual port of\r\n    embarkation and disembarkation for our messengers.\r\n\r\n    Things are at present at a deadlock. The French want: either a peace\r\n    without cession of territory; or an armistice with the revictualling\r\n    of Paris for the number of days it lasts; or a European Congress to\r\n    settle the terms of peace between France and Germany. Bismarck\r\n    peremptorily rejects all three proposals, and does not say precisely\r\n    what his conditions of peace are. I suppose the King of Prussia\r\n    holds to taking Paris as a satisfaction to military vanity, and that\r\n    if the military situation continues favourable to Germany, he will\r\n    accept nothing much short of unconditional surrender, while Paris\r\n    resists. Of course, unless, by a miracle, Paris is relieved, its\r\n    surrender is a question of time--but of how much time? They declare\r\n    here that it can hold out without any very material suffering until\r\n    the middle of January, and for many weeks longer, if the population\r\n    will be content to live on bread and wine. But, supposing Paris to\r\n    fall, will peace be made? Here it is declared that the South will\r\n    still continue the war, and at any rate there seems to be every\r\n    probability that the violent party will not surrender its power\r\n    without a struggle. Then the financial question must soon become a\r\n    difficulty. I am told that since the investment of Paris began three\r\n    months ago, not less than thirty-two millions sterling have been\r\n    spent. It is however idle to speculate when events march so fast. I\r\n    can tell you little of the present state of the armies. Bourbaki is,\r\n    I believe, at Bourges, and Chanzy at Le Mans. I have a military\r\n    attaché,[26] Fielding, who has been with Chanzy's army during all the\r\n    affairs near Orleans and since, and who has the highest opinion of\r\n    his military talents.\r\n\r\n    The acceptance, pure and simple, of the Conference on the Russian\r\n    question arrived from Paris the day before yesterday.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of December the remarkable elasticity of the French\r\ncharacter was manifested in a recovery from the depression which had\r\nbeen produced by the failure of the sorties from Paris and the recapture\r\nof Orleans by the Germans. The overpowering energy of Gambetta was\r\nchiefly responsible for the creation of new armies, and the moment again\r\nappeared unfavourable for peaceful counsels. Thiers and his party\r\nconsidered that the Government was only pushing the country on to more\r\ncomplete ruin, and were urgent in their call for a National Assembly.\r\nThe majority of the great towns of the South, Bordeaux included, were\r\nagainst an Assembly or any interference with the existing Government,\r\nand Gambetta and his adherents were determined to go on with the war and\r\nkeep themselves in power by all means available. Gambetta was the only\r\nmember of the Government outside Paris who counted for anything, and the\r\nmoderates were placed at a considerable disadvantage owing to Jules\r\nFavre being detained there.\r\n\r\nThiers, who had never joined the Government, prognosticated that it\r\nwould immediately come to an end upon the fall of Paris, and that a\r\nmoderate (_honnête_) republic would be established in the greater part\r\nof the country, while Lyons, Marseilles, Toulon and other places in the\r\nsouth would set up a socialistic form of government, and do an enormous\r\namount of harm before suppression. In the opinion of competent judges,\r\nif the country could have been fairly polled at this particular period,\r\nthe majority (consisting of course mainly of the peasants) would have\r\nbeen found to be Bonapartist, in spite of all that had taken place. The\r\nbourgeoisie and inhabitants of the smaller towns would have shown\r\nthemselves to be in favour of quiet and security of property, and would\r\ntherefore have probably voted for the Orleanists, as the best\r\nrepresentatives of those principles; and the masses in the large towns\r\nwould have turned out to be republican and socialist. A genuinely free\r\nexpression of opinion would, however, have been difficult to secure, for\r\nGambetta's prefects were, if anything, more unscrupulous than the\r\nEmperor's and, under existing circumstances, had greater means of\r\ndownright intimidation.\r\n\r\nIn the closing days of 1870 fresh efforts were made by H.M. Government\r\nto start the Black Sea Conference as soon as possible, and to persuade\r\nthe French to send a representative without delay. Under the\r\ncircumstances, it might have been supposed that they would have named\r\ntheir Ambassador in London, but for some obscure reason, it was decided\r\nthat Jules Favre was the only possible man, and as he was shut up in\r\nParis it was necessary to obtain a safe conduct for him from the\r\nGermans. The following letter is of interest as an impartial\r\nappreciation of Jules Favre, and as containing some sage opinions upon\r\nthe question of the Black Sea and the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Bordeaux, Dec. 26, 1870.\r\n\r\n    I did all I could in favour of Tissot. He would have been a much\r\n    more convenient plenipotentiary than Jules Favre and have\r\n    facilitated the business of the Conference and the speedy\r\n    termination of it. Jules Favre is, I believe an honest and really\r\n    patriotic man--by which I mean a man who will sacrifice his own\r\n    position and interests to what he believes to be the real good of\r\n    his country. But he has not hitherto shown himself to be a good\r\n    diplomatist or a skilful negotiator, and is too much led away by his\r\n    feelings to be a good practical man of business. He will at all\r\n    events go to London with a real knowledge of the state of things in\r\n    Paris, and if he thinks the convocation of a National Assembly\r\n    feasible and advisable, will have more means than any one else of\r\n    bringing it about in spite of Gambetta. It will be good too that he\r\n    should see for himself what the real feelings and intentions of the\r\n    English Government are. He is a man, who would, I should think, be\r\n    touched by real kindness and consideration for his country and\r\n    himself in these times, and sensitive in case anything like a slight\r\n    was put upon him or them--and particularly if the situation of\r\n    France were not taken very seriously by all who approach him. He was\r\n    a fierce and even truculent orator in the Chamber, but in private\r\n    life is mild and agreeable. His power of speaking may be an\r\n    inconvenience in the Diplomatic Conference, and I fancy he is led\r\n    away by his 'verve' when he does get into a speech, and says\r\n    sometimes things more forcible than judicious. I should think he\r\n    would never himself sign a peace by which territory was yielded, but\r\n    I conceive him to be a man who would make room for others to do so,\r\n    and help them, if he was really convinced that it was necessary for\r\n    France.\r\n\r\n    I suppose the Germans will make no difficulty about the safe\r\n    conduct: it is for their interest to have some influential member of\r\n    the Government who might enable peace to be made in an emergency, in\r\n    which Gambetta might, if unchecked, have recourse to desperate\r\n    measures.\r\n\r\n    At this moment I think the French have recovered their hope of\r\n    making a successful resistance to the Dismemberment of the country.\r\n    I am not very sanguine after all that has occurred, but I do think\r\n    the military prospects less gloomy than they have been since Sèdan,\r\n    or at all events, since Metz. You will, I conclude, soon have a\r\n    really trustworthy account of things in Paris from Claremont.\r\n\r\n    The Conference, I suppose, must end in Russia carrying her main\r\n    point practically, and therefore it only remains to make it as much\r\n    as possible an antidote to the scheme of raising her prestige in\r\n    Turkey, by the form she adopted, of setting the other parties to the\r\n    Treaty at defiance. I am afraid not much can be done towards this. I\r\n    should suggest a very careful consideration of the meaning of the\r\n    restoration to the Sultan of the right to open the Dardanelles and\r\n    the Bosphorus at pleasure, and a very cautious wording of the\r\n    article establishing it. Otherwise, considering the weakness of the\r\n    Porte, I am afraid the new right might become a snare and a danger\r\n    rather than a safeguard. It was so much easier for the Porte to say:\r\n    'I cannot' in answer to inconvenient importunity, than it will in\r\n    future be to say: 'I will not.' Even under the Treaty prohibition\r\n    the Turks had not the firmness they might have had in resisting\r\n    demands for vessels to pass. I can conceive circumstances under\r\n    which it might suit them to let a Russian fleet through into the\r\n    Mediterranean, if only to be rid of it for the time in the Black Sea.\r\n\r\nIn Busch's 'Bismarck' there are many references to Jules Favre's\r\nemotional disposition. At the first interview which took place, a French\r\npeasant was told to keep watch outside the house where the Chancellor\r\nand Favre were negotiating, and the latter was unable to resist the\r\ntemptation of making a speech to his fellow-countryman. 'Favre, who had\r\ngone into the house with the Chancellor, came out and addressed his\r\ncountryman in a speech full of pathos and noble sentiments. Disorderly\r\nattacks had been made, which, he said, must be stopped. He, Favre, was\r\nnot a spy, but, on the contrary, a member of the new Government, which\r\nhad undertaken to defend the interests of the country, and which\r\nrepresented its dignity. In the name of International Law and of the\r\nhonour of France, he called upon him to keep watch, and to see that the\r\nplace was held sacred. That was imperatively demanded by his, the\r\nstatesman's, honour, as well as by that of the peasant, and so forth.\r\nThe honest rustic looked particularly silly as he listened open-mouthed\r\nto all this high falutin, which he evidently understood as little\r\nas if it were so much Greek.' Bismarck entertained a well-founded\r\ncontempt for rhetoric, and Jules Favre's eloquent verbosity was to him\r\nonly an instance of the way in which Frenchmen could be successfully\r\nduped. 'You can give a Frenchman twenty-five lashes, and if you only\r\nmake a fine speech to him about the freedom and dignity of man of which\r\nthose lashes are the expression, and at the same time strike a fitting\r\nattitude, he will persuade himself that he is not being thrashed.' It is\r\nprobable too that Jules Favre's inability to appreciate Bismarck's\r\nundisguised cynicism contributed to the disfavour with which he was\r\nregarded as compared with the other negotiator, Thiers. When during one\r\nstage of the negotiations, Jules Favre complained that his position in\r\nParis was very critical, Bismarck proposed to him that he should\r\norganize a rising so as to be able to suppress it whilst he still had an\r\narmy at his disposal: 'he looked at me quite terror-stricken, as if he\r\nwished to say, \"How bloodthirsty you are!\" I explained to him, however,\r\nthat that was the only right way to manage the mob.'\r\n\r\nWhatever the merits or demerits of Jules Favre, a disagreeable surprise\r\nwas inflicted upon both the British Government and the Government of\r\nNational Defence by a refusal on the part of Bismarck to give him a safe\r\nconduct through the German lines. At first, difficulties were raised in\r\nconnection with alleged violations of flags of truce; but upon the issue\r\nof a proclamation by Jules Favre, Bismarck took advantage of the\r\nopportunity in order to prevent his departure for London on the ground\r\nthat it would imply an official recognition of the Government of\r\nNational Defence.\r\n\r\nAt all events, he made such stipulations about the way in which the safe\r\nconduct should be applied for, that Jules Favre with his strong\r\nsentimental character found it impossible to comply with them, and he\r\nwas also honourably reluctant to leave Paris just before the bombardment\r\nwas about to begin. Bismarck, it is clear, was determined that he should\r\nnot go to London if he could prevent it. The meeting of the Conference\r\nwas postponed and by the time the final arrangements in connection with\r\nit had been made, negotiations for peace had begun and it became\r\nnecessary for Favre to remain in Paris.\r\n\r\nAt the close of 1870, the bombardment of Paris had not yet begun: the\r\nFrench hopes of military success were based upon Generals Chanzy and\r\nBourbaki; the German terms of peace were still unknown, and there was\r\nevery sign that the extreme Republicans were disposed to break with\r\nFavre and Trochu and to perpetuate their power by war _à outrance_ and a\r\n_loi des suspects_, or reign of terror. The most surprising feature in\r\nthe situation was that Russia, who had been in fact an active ally of\r\nPrussia, by undertaking to watch Austria, and had obtained nothing\r\nwhatever for France, was in much higher favour than the other blameless\r\nneutrals, it being fondly imagined that the Emperor Alexander's\r\ninfluence would be successful in obtaining favourable peace terms; and\r\nso adroitly did the Russians play their cards, that they persuaded\r\nMoltke that the 'malevolent neutrality' of England was the sole cause of\r\nthe continuance of the war. Such at least was the purport of a\r\ncommunication which the latter made to Mr. Odo Russell at Versailles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Bordeaux, Jan. 7, 1871.\r\n\r\n    The French claim a success at Bapaume, but prudent people are\r\n    already speculating on what the consequences of the fall of Paris\r\n    will be. It is very generally thought that Gambetta will place\r\n    himself at the head of the ultra-Republicans, throw himself into\r\n    Lyons, or some other southern town, and proclaim war and democracy\r\n    _à outrance_. But what will Bismarck do at Paris? Will he try to\r\n    obtain a government with whom he may make a reasonable peace, or\r\n    will he promote war and anarchy with a view to ruin France utterly,\r\n    and induce her to accept a monarch from his hand? In the former case\r\n    he will perhaps either summon the old Legislative Body, or get\r\n    together some meeting of Notables, who might appoint a provisional\r\n    government to sanction a National Constituent Assembly as soon as\r\n    possible, and in the meantime to treat upon the preliminaries of\r\n    peace. The Moderates and chiefs of the old parties (except the\r\n    ultra-Republican) might be not unwilling either to attend a summons\r\n    of the old Corps Législatif, or to some other temporary body; for\r\n    they are excessively dissatisfied with their present position, and\r\n    think they see symptoms of the approach of the reign of terror and\r\n    of a violent socialistic government.\r\n\r\n    As for Bismarck's notion of bringing back the Emperor at the head of\r\n    the captive army, it is, I suppose, very doubtful whether the\r\n    Emperor would give in to it, still more doubtful whether the\r\n    released army would, and quite certain that the country would loathe\r\n    a sovereign thus imposed upon it. If however Bismarck is bent upon\r\n    it, it must be supposed that he intends to make some concessions to\r\n    the Emperor to make his return to France palatable to the nation. If\r\n    so, Belgium will be in danger, and Holland also, and Bismarck may\r\n    return to one of his former projects of coming to an understanding\r\n    with France, through the Emperor, and dealing with the small states\r\n    just as he pleases. I suppose Russia will look after Denmark as well\r\n    as she can. These dangers may seem visionary but I don't think they\r\n    are so visionary as to make it superfluous to consider how\r\n    they may be guarded against. Hateful as it would be to the towns and\r\n    the educated classes, to have a sovereign imposed upon them by\r\n    Prussia, it must not be forgotten that the peasants are still\r\n    Bonapartists, and that a plébiscite in favour of the Empire might be\r\n    managed.\r\n\r\n    I think I have made them feel here that you have been very friendly\r\n    and considerate about Jules Favre.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the year 1871, the hope of relieving Paris depended\r\nupon the three armies which the energy of Gambetta and the Government of\r\nNational Defence had created in the North, Centre, and West, and on\r\npaper the prospects of the French were far from hopeless, for their\r\nforces in numbers far exceeded those of the Germans. In Paris alone\r\nthere were supposed to be something like half a million fighting men,\r\nand the three armies above mentioned amounted to between four and five\r\nhundred thousand men. The Germans had 220,000 men in position round\r\nParis, their forces in the provinces were numerically inferior to the\r\nFrench armies opposed to them, and the strain upon them must undoubtedly\r\nhave been severe. The quality of Gambetta's levies, however, was unequal\r\nto the task, and as each of the French armies succumbed in turn, the\r\nfall of Paris became inevitable. The bombardment, which had been\r\npostponed as long as possible, in the hope that internal disorders would\r\nprecipitate the capitulation, began in January.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Bordeaux, January 12, 1871.\r\n\r\n    If the telegraphic intelligence which is published as having come by\r\n    this balloon is to be depended upon, the Prussians have begun the\r\n    actual bombardment of the town of Paris itself, without giving\r\n    Diplomatists, Neutrals, or any other non-combatants a chance of\r\n    withdrawing. To say nothing of other feelings, this makes me very\r\n    uneasy about the English left in the place. Most of them have\r\n    perhaps only themselves to blame for staying in despite of warning\r\n    but there must be many who had valid reasons, or were without the\r\n    means to come away.\r\n\r\n    People are very much alarmed as to what may happen inside the town\r\n    for the last two or three days, if a surrender become inevitable.\r\n    There are two or three hundred thousand people (workmen and their\r\n    families) who have a positive interest in the continuance of the\r\n    siege, during which they are supported by the Government without\r\n    being called upon to expose themselves, or at all events without in\r\n    fact exposing themselves to much danger.\r\n\r\n    The intention of not listening to terms of peace, including any\r\n    cession of territory, whether Paris be taken or not, is as loudly\r\n    and as positively proclaimed here as ever. I am afraid Bismarck, who\r\n    certainly does not at all understand the French character, and who\r\n    does not appear to have a very delicate consideration for anybody's\r\n    feelings, may add to the difficulties of peace by the manner in\r\n    which his conditions are propounded, as well as by the substance of\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    The Diplomatists here are beginning to talk hypothetically of what\r\n    they should do if one or more Governments should be set up in France\r\n    on the fall of Paris. I do not think much good comes of giving\r\n    opinions beforehand on supposed cases. It is of course clear that\r\n    the Diplomatic Body cannot go wandering about France in the suite of\r\n    any set of men, who are not beyond dispute the _de facto_ Government\r\n    of the country. And I suppose, _caeteris paribus_, if there be a\r\n    Government in the Capital that must be taken to be the Government\r\n    for the time being. It is so impossible to foresee what will happen,\r\n    that I do not ask you for instructions.\r\n\r\n    Chaudordy on the other hand, continues to press for the immediate\r\n    recognition of the Government of National Defence by England--saying\r\n    that they do not want any fresh letters of credence to be presented,\r\n    but would be quite satisfied with a simple note declaring that Her\r\n    Majesty's Government entered into official relations with the\r\n    existing Government in France. I conclude that Gambetta urges him to\r\n    do this, with a view to strengthen the position of the National\r\n    Defence Government or of what remains of it, if Paris falls; and on\r\n    the other hand Chaudordy himself would be very glad to have obtained\r\n    some decided result during his Administration of the _extra muros_\r\n    foreign Department. He has certainly on the whole acted with skill\r\n    in a very difficult position, and France and the Government ought to\r\n    congratulate themselves on having him to act for them. I don't think\r\n    that Jules Favre or any member of the Government would have done\r\n    anything like as well. But in France more even than in other\r\n    countries a little éclat is more appreciated than years of useful\r\n    unobtrusive labour.\r\n\r\n    Thiers has told me in the strictest confidence that when he was at\r\n    Versailles Bismarck offered to make peace on the basis of a\r\n    pecuniary indemnity, the retention of Strasburg and Alsace, and the\r\n    restoration to France of Metz and Lorraine. They seem to have\r\n    brought the matter sufficiently into shape to be submitted to the\r\n    Government at Paris. Thiers wanted Trochu, Picard and Jules Favre to\r\n    come to him to the outposts, but, as you may recollect, only Favre\r\n    came. Thiers offered to take upon himself the responsibility and\r\n    odium of signing a treaty on this basis, if the Government would\r\n    make him its plenipotentiary, but Favre declared that it would be\r\n    impossible even to mention any cession of territory even to the\r\n    people of Paris.\r\n\r\n    The most astonishing thing to me perhaps is the buoyancy of the\r\n    French finances. I understand that the Government have by strong\r\n    persuasion obtained from the Banque de France a new loan (it is said\r\n    of upwards of twenty millions sterling) and this will keep them\r\n    going for the present. There is already however, some difficulty in\r\n    circulating the 'bons du Trésor' even at a discount.\r\n\r\n    I had observed the advertisements in the second columns of the\r\n    _Times_ and thought of trying to get the paper occasionally into\r\n    Paris. In fact however the advertisers have exactly the same means\r\n    of sending letters and telegrams to Paris that I have. I will\r\n    nevertheless try. No special help can be expected from the\r\n    Government. It is only by using the thinnest paper and reducing the\r\n    despatches by means of photography that they can bring them within\r\n    the weight which pigeons or secret messengers are able to carry.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason for doubting the correctness of this important\r\nstatement made by Thiers, and it only shows how much more competent he\r\nwas to conduct the negotiations than Jules Favre, and what a much better\r\njudge he was of the real situation than Gambetta. It would indeed be one\r\nof the ironies of history if the failure of Picard and Trochu to meet\r\nhim at the outposts on that eventful day in November was the cause of\r\nthe loss of a province to France, and of a vast addition to the war\r\nindemnity.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before a succession of hideous disasters demonstrated\r\nthe hopelessness of the French situation. General Chanzy, in command of\r\nthe army of the West, although in superior force, was completely\r\ndefeated at Le Mans on January 12th. On the 19th, the Northern army\r\nunder Faidherbe was defeated at St. Quentin and ceased practically to\r\ntake any further part in the war. On the same date a sortie from Paris\r\non a large scale was repulsed with heavy loss, and produced amongst\r\nother results the resignation of Trochu, a sanguinary riot in the town,\r\nand the liberation from prison of Flourens and other revolutionaries.\r\nThe crowning misfortune was the memorable _débâcle_ of Bourbaki, one of\r\nthe most tragic episodes in modern warfare. It was evident that further\r\nresistance was useless, and the fictions which had so long sustained the\r\nspirits of the defenders of Paris were finally destroyed. On January 23,\r\nthe unfortunate Jules Favre presented himself at Versailles and as there\r\nwas no further question of 'pas une pierre de nos forteresses etc.,' an\r\narmistice was finally agreed to on the 28th. Under the provisions of the\r\narmistice it was arranged that elections should be held as soon as\r\npossible for a National Assembly in order that the question of the\r\ncontinuance of the war, and upon what conditions peace should be made,\r\nmight be decided. Jules Favre, unlucky to the last, stipulated that the\r\nNational Guards should be permitted to retain their arms, a concession\r\nwhich he had cause bitterly to regret before long.\r\n\r\nThe news of the armistice was received at Bordeaux with rather less\r\nindignation than had been expected, but Jules Favre was loudly denounced\r\nfor not having included in it Bourbaki's army, the fact being that\r\nBismarck, who was well aware of the ruin which threatened the force, had\r\nexpressly refused to do so. Gambetta, while not actually repudiating the\r\narmistice, issued violent proclamations, loudly denouncing its authors,\r\ndeclaring that his policy as Minister of War remained unchanged, and\r\nurging that the period of the armistice should be employed in organizing\r\nthe forces which were destined to free France from the invaders. These\r\nproclamations were followed by a decree in which the liberty-loving\r\ndemocrat enacted that no person should be eligible for the new Assembly\r\nwho was connected with the royal families which had hitherto reigned in\r\nFrance, or any one who had served in any capacity as an official under\r\nthe Empire. This outrageous proceeding produced a protest from Bismarck\r\non the ground that it was a violation of the freedom of election\r\nstipulated in the armistice, and as Gambetta continued recalcitrant, the\r\nParis section of the Government of National Defence, which included,\r\namongst others, Favre, Trochu, and Jules Ferry, issued another decree on\r\nFebruary 4, annulling that of Gambetta. Representatives of the National\r\nDefence Government from Paris arrived at Bordeaux on February 6, and\r\nupon that day Gambetta resigned the office of Minister of War, and\r\nEmmanuel Arago was appointed in his place. As Paris was now again in\r\ncommunication with the outside world, the opportunity was taken, not\r\nonly of cancelling Gambetta's decrees, but of getting rid of the\r\nDelegation Government, of which he had been the virtual dictator.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Bordeaux, Feb. 7, 1871.\r\n\r\n    So far as we can judge here (and we have not very good means of\r\n    judging) the moderate Conservative 'Ticket' is likely to be carried\r\n    in most of the Elections. The result would be an assembly composed\r\n    of men who in their own hearts will wish for peace, and whose\r\n    Constituents will heartily wish for it. But there is always fear of\r\n    each individually thinking it necessary to express for himself in\r\n    public heroic sentiments, and of no one being willing to bell the\r\n    cat and sign or even vote for ratifying the Treaty. Much of course\r\n    will depend upon the terms. The cession of Alsace might possibly be\r\n    submitted to, if it were distinctly apparent that it was the only\r\n    means of saving Lorraine. The terms of the Armistice would make one\r\n    hope that Bismarck is at least willing to avoid propounding\r\n    conditions unnecessarily irritating.\r\n\r\n    Probably the most prudent thing for France to do would be to accept\r\n    anything like reasonable terms of peace at once--for every day's\r\n    delay in the departure of the German troops from the country,\r\n    retards most seriously the beginning of the recovery from the\r\n    misfortunes military, political, and financial, which are exhausting\r\n    the springs of life. It is nevertheless very probable that the\r\n    Assembly, or the Government it appoints, will make a solemn official\r\n    appeal to Europe for its mediation. They may also ground a special\r\n    appeal to Europe on the plea that the people of the Provinces to be\r\n    ceded, ought to have a voice in the matter. In fact they have much\r\n    to say to Europe, to which it will be difficult to make an answer.\r\n    Bismarck, however, seems to be ready to snap his fingers at Europe.\r\n\r\n    Chaudordy naturally declines as far as possible the responsibility\r\n    of talking or taking any measures, as he is now the servant of a\r\n    Government, whose existence will probably end in a few days.\r\n    Privately he urges strongly, with a view to public opinion in\r\n    France, that England should be very prompt in recognizing officially\r\n    the Government appointed by the Assembly. In this I think he is\r\n    right.\r\n\r\n    Prudent men (Thiers included) appear to think that at all events as\r\n    a temporary measure, a moderate republic, as the form of Government\r\n    least likely to produce dissension should be adopted. Indeed, of the\r\n    various pretenders, no one I suppose would wish to be in any way\r\n    responsible for such a peace as must be concluded. Some people\r\n    indeed apprehend that the Assembly may be too conservative, or as it\r\n    is called, reactionary, but I don't think this need give any one but\r\n    the Rouges the least uneasiness.\r\n\r\n    The appearance now is that Gambetta will not go beyond legal\r\n    opposition, and that he will content himself with putting himself at\r\n    the head of the ultra-democratic and '_guerre-à-outrance_' party in\r\n    the Assembly. In fact there is no symptom that an attempt to set\r\n    himself up, by the aid of the mob in the great towns, in opposition\r\n    to the Assembly would have any success. He is not himself by\r\n    character inclined to such courses, but he has people about him who\r\n    are.\r\n\r\n    Jules Favre is fiercely attacked first for having concluded an\r\n    armistice which did not comprehend the Army of the East, and\r\n    secondly for not having mentioned this exception when he announced\r\n    the armistice to the Delegation here. This last proceeding (which I\r\n    attribute to his want of business-like habits), is of course utterly\r\n    indefensible. It may however have been rather convenient than\r\n    otherwise to Gambetta, as it enables him to attribute to this cause\r\n    the flight into Switzerland, which I suppose, the Army of the East\r\n    must at all events have been driven to. The attack against him for\r\n    not surrendering Paris at discretion, and stipulating nothing for\r\n    the Provinces, seems to me to be more unfair--for what would the\r\n    Provinces have said if he had let loose upon them the forces, which\r\n    after the occupation of the forts might have been spared from the\r\n    German Army round Paris.\r\n\r\n    Barring accidents, there seems reason to hope that we shall tide\r\n    over the time to the meeting of the Assembly next week, pretty\r\n    quietly.\r\n\r\n    At all events the suspension of the bloodshed and other horrors is a\r\n    relief which I feel every moment. Four Prussian shells fell into the\r\n    small convent near the Val de Grace at Paris in which I have a\r\n    niece--but providentially neither she nor any of her fellow nuns\r\n    were hurt.\r\n\r\nThe elections to the new National Assembly took place on February 8, all\r\npolitical groups participating, and resulted more or less in accordance\r\nwith general expectation. In Paris, where there were many abstentions,\r\nextreme men like Louis Blanc, Victor Hugo, Gambetta and Rochefort were\r\nreturned, and the example of Paris was to some extent followed by the\r\nbig towns, but the general tone of the Assembly proved to be\r\nconservative, and almost reactionary, the sole question submitted to the\r\ncandidates having been that of Peace or War. In effect, the feeling\r\napparently predominant in the minds of the majority of the electors was\r\naversion from the Government of National Defence, a feeling naturally\r\naccentuated by the recent crushing disasters, and the result was to throw\r\ndiscredit upon the Republican system of Government with which the\r\nMinisters were identified. But although the Assembly was in reality\r\nanti-Republican it was not the opinion of experienced politicians that\r\nit would be advisable to proclaim a monarchy; still less, that any one\r\nof the rival dynasties should be called immediately to the throne. On\r\nthe contrary, they considered that a republic, moderate in its\r\nprinciples, and perhaps tacitly understood to be only temporary, would\r\nbest promote union for the present, and that under such a form of\r\nGovernment it might be easier to obtain a ratification of such a peace\r\nas appeared to be possible, and to carry the painful measures necessary\r\nto give effect to it. It was also thought that if a monarchy were to be\r\nestablished it would have a better chance of enduring if the dynasty\r\npostponed its accession until the wounds from which the country was\r\nsuffering should begin to heal, and that the all-important choice of a\r\nsovereign should be postponed to a calmer period. So far as could be\r\njudged, if a dynasty were decided upon at all, the chances appeared to\r\nbe in favour of the House of Orleans, but there were nevertheless,\r\namongst the members returned, between one hundred and fifty to two\r\nhundred Legitimist supporters of the Comte de Chambord, and not a few\r\nBonapartists.\r\n\r\nAs for the all-important question of peace or war which the Assembly was\r\nto be called upon to decide, it was evident that the majority of the\r\nelectors, in voting against the existing Government, intended to vote at\r\nthe same time for peace, and therefore the majority of the members\r\nentered it with pacific intentions; but they were not prepared to vote\r\nfor peace at any price, and although conditions which would have been\r\nscouted two months earlier were now considered to be worthy of\r\ndiscussion, the exaction of immoderate and humiliating demands might\r\nagain arouse the spirit of desperate resistance, especially when argued\r\nunder the excitement produced by heated parliamentary debates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Bordeaux, Feb. 10, 1871.\r\n\r\n    Thiers, Dufaure, and Grévy are likely, so far as one can judge,\r\n    without knowing the result of the Paris elections, to take the lead\r\n    in the National Assembly. Grévy is avowedly a moderate Republican,\r\n    and the two others are for a moderate Republic, as a transitional\r\n    government to prepare the way for a Constitutional Monarchy. Such,\r\n    at least, are certainly Thiers's views, but I am speaking rather\r\n    without book about Dufaure.\r\n\r\n    What I am most afraid of is that Bismarck's conditions may be so\r\n    hard as to turn the really pacific Assembly into a war _à outrance_\r\n    one. The war could not in all probability go on long, but it might\r\n    give us three months more of bloodshed, destruction and misery, and\r\n    add to the difficulty of establishing eventually a good government\r\n    here. An Assembly elected two months ago would have been very\r\n    different from the present one, supposing one could have been\r\n    elected at all; but, two months ago, Gambetta would have been strong\r\n    enough to reject the armistice and refuse to convoke the Assembly.\r\n    His entourage had even now prepared warrants for arrest of his\r\n    colleagues, with a view to his assuming the Dictatorship and going\r\n    on with the war without an Assembly, but he is wiser and less wicked\r\n    than they. He will probably make a vigorous leader of the violent\r\n    Republican opposition in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n    Of course under present circumstances I have nothing to do but to\r\n    stay here, as it will be for the present the seat of government. It\r\n    will be a comfort to have a whole real government, and not half a\r\n    one, to deal with.\r\n\r\n    Chaudordy has at last come round to the opinion that a\r\n    plenipotentiary should be named to the Conference, simply to speak\r\n    for France on the Black Sea question, without any _arrière pensée_\r\n    about bringing in other matters. He said he would telegraph as well\r\n    as he could _en clair_ to let Jules Favre know this. Bismarck will\r\n    not let telegrams in cypher through, and there are no more pigeons.\r\n\r\n    What the French are craving for is some open, patent sympathy and\r\n    support from us. They would give us comparatively little thanks for\r\n    taking unostentatious steps in their favour with the Germans, though\r\n    such steps were much better calculated to obtain something for them.\r\n\r\nThe extreme desirability of showing some evident sign of sympathy with\r\nFrance was impressed upon Her Majesty's Government who were urged to\r\nlose no time in doing so, with a view to the future relations between\r\nthe two countries. The French, who certainty are not less prone than\r\nother nations in seeking to attribute a large share of their misfortunes\r\nto the shortcomings of other people, were inclined to put the blame of\r\ntheir calamities and disasters as much as possible, upon the Neutral\r\nPowers, who had not interfered actively in their defence; and England,\r\nwho had certainly exerted herself more than any other Power in seeking\r\npractical means for making peace attainable, was very unjustly singled\r\nout for peculiar obloquy. This feeling had arisen partly because the\r\nlong alliance between the two countries had made the French expect more\r\nfrom England than from others; partly because other Powers had\r\ningeniously represented that their own inertness had been caused by the\r\nunwillingness of England to come forward, and had also, on various\r\noccasions, put England forward as the leading Power among the Neutrals,\r\nin order to give her the greatest share of the unpopularity which\r\naccompanies neutrality. French feeling was, therefore, at the time\r\nhighly irritable on the subject of England, and it was suggested that a\r\ngood impression would be created if Her Majesty's Government would be\r\nvery prompt in recognizing whatever Government were adopted by the new\r\nAssembly, even if it did not assume a permanent character. Another\r\nsuggestion was, that if the terms offered by the Germans appeared\r\nunendurably hard, the French might make an appeal to the rest of Europe;\r\nthat appeal would probably take the form of a request for the mediation\r\nof the Great Neutral Powers, or for the assembling of an European\r\nCongress, and an immediate compliance on the part of England with either\r\nof these requests would go far towards re-establishing good feeling.\r\nEven if Germany rejected all intervention, this would not affect the\r\nimpression made by the action of England in responding to the appeal of\r\nFrance, and although more could probably be obtained by the exercise of\r\nquiet and unostentatious influence upon Germany, yet nothing that might\r\nbe obtained in that way would have anything like the same value in the\r\neyes of France as an open declaration of sympathy with her and an avowed\r\nadvocacy of her cause, even if no practical result followed. In short,\r\nwhat was required, at that particular moment, was a policy of\r\nsympathetic gush.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Bordeaux, Feb. 16, 1870.\r\n\r\n    Your telegrams announcing that you have adjourned the Conference,\r\n    and that I may recognize the new Government immediately have been a\r\n    great satisfaction to me. I hope we shall bring French feeling round\r\n    to its old cordial state, if we can give them a little patent\r\n    sympathy in their misfortunes. The Commercial Treaty will be a\r\n    trouble hereafter, but it was in great danger even before the fall\r\n    of the Empire, and I hope will be let remain quiet until the time\r\n    approaches for giving the notice next February.\r\n\r\n    I had a confidential conversation with Thiers last night. He seems\r\n    to have taken already _de facto_ the direction of affairs, and will\r\n    probably be given it _de jure_ by the Assembly to-morrow. He is very\r\n    anxious to keep the three fractions of the Chamber who are for order\r\n    at home and for a reasonable policy about peace together, in order\r\n    to resist the Reds. He means therefore to take moderate Republicans,\r\n    Legitimists and Orleanists into his Ministry. Jules Favre is to be\r\n    his Minister for Foreign Affairs, and there will of course be\r\n    moderate Orleanists and Legitimists. If Thiers can succeed in\r\n    getting the united support of Orleanists, Legitimists, and moderate\r\n    Republicans, he expects to have a working majority of nearly\r\n    three-quarters of the Assembly. I suppose his difficulty will arise\r\n    from the impatience of the Orleanists, who are believed to have\r\n    nearly half the seats in the Assembly, and who are impatient and\r\n    hungry after their long deprivation of the sweets of power.\r\n\r\n    Thiers told me that he should take great pains to select men of\r\n    station and ability for his diplomatic appointments. In furtherance\r\n    of his policy of conciliating all parties, he supports M. Grévy, a\r\n    moderate Republican, for the Presidency of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n    I like Jules Favre and have a good opinion of his character, but I\r\n    don't think that he has hitherto shown himself to be skilful as a\r\n    diplomatist or a negotiator. Thiers says however that he now gets on\r\n    extremely well with Bismarck. There is however a very general\r\n    opinion that Thiers means to go himself to Versailles to negotiate\r\n    the Peace. He did not give me to understand that he intended to do\r\n    so, and there are serious inconveniences in the head of the\r\n    Government's being away from the Assembly and the centre of affairs,\r\n    to say nothing of the ordinary objections to the chief of a\r\n    Government conducting negotiations in his own person.\r\n\r\n    The feeling in the Assembly yesterday when Alsace and Lorraine were\r\n    mentioned was strong and universal, and gives reason to doubt\r\n    whether they will even now be brought to vote a cession of\r\n    territory. In that case I suppose the only remedy would be a\r\n    plébiscite, if a cession of territory is absolutely insisted upon.\r\n    The Assembly might refer the question to the people, and I suppose\r\n    that, in their present mood, the great majority of the population\r\n    voting secretly, would vote Peace and not War, and that the vote\r\n    might be taken in a very short time. I don't know however what the\r\n    Germans would say to the notion, and I don't think such a plan of\r\n    throwing off the responsibility worthy of the Assembly, or a happy\r\n    precedent for Parliamentary Government.\r\n\r\n    Of what Thiers means to do respecting the definitive government of\r\n    the country, he gave me no hint. His present policy is to try and\r\n    get France out of her present straits by the united help of all the\r\n    reasonable parties, and not to give any indication as to the future\r\n    which might have the effect of alienating any of them.\r\n\r\nAs had been expected, Thiers proceeded himself to Versailles to\r\nnegotiate the Peace preliminaries. He was obviously the person best\r\nfitted to do so, for he was at once the most moderate and capable\r\namongst Frenchmen, the least unwilling to make terms in conformity with\r\nthe exigencies of the situation, and the only man in a position to carry\r\nhis way in the Assembly.\r\n\r\nOn February 26, the preliminaries of Peace were signed and contained\r\neven harsher conditions than had been anticipated, but the military\r\nposition of France was so absolutely hopeless that resistance to them\r\nwas impracticable. The war indemnity was reduced from six milliards to\r\nfive, but this constituted the sole success of the French negotiators,\r\nunless the formal entry of the German troops into Paris might be taken\r\nas a somewhat barren substitute for the restoration of Belfort; certain\r\nmatters of detail, chiefly connected with finance, were postponed for\r\nfuture consideration at Frankfort.\r\n\r\nIn view of what has already been written respecting the secret\r\nnegotiations which took place during the campaign, it is impossible not\r\nto be struck with the heroic folly displayed by the French in the latter\r\nstages of the war. If it is true that their gallant struggle under the\r\nstimulus of Gambetta and the Government of National Defence inspired the\r\nadmiration of the world, it is equally obvious that human life and\r\ntreasure were ruthlessly wasted in a hopeless cause. Bismarck, it is\r\nwell known, was strongly opposed to any accession of territory, beyond\r\nwhat was absolutely necessary, and would have much preferred a pecuniary\r\ncompensation. If, instead of following the lead of Gambetta, the\r\ncounsels of Thiers had been adopted, peace would have been made long\r\nbefore the fall of Paris became imminent; millions of money would have\r\nbeen saved, thousands of lives would not have been uselessly sacrificed,\r\nand Lorraine would have remained French instead of becoming the chief\r\ncontributory cause towards undying hatred of the German people.\r\n\r\nThiers returned to Bordeaux upon the accomplishment of his melancholy\r\nmission, and a debate took place in the Assembly on the question of the\r\nratification of the Peace preliminaries. The discussion gave opportunity\r\nfor much recrimination and for much display of emotion, especially on\r\nthe part of Victor Hugo, but Thiers's success was a foregone conclusion\r\nand the Peace preliminaries were accepted by 546 votes to 107.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Bordeaux, March 2, 1871.\r\n\r\n    I suppose we may say peace at last. I hear that the discoveries made\r\n    by the Committees on the Military Forces and on the Finances were so\r\n    overwhelming, as to convince every member that defence was\r\n    absolutely impossible. This reduced the debate yesterday to mere\r\n    idle vapouring on the part of the Opposition. One speech was simply\r\n    absurd--that of Victor Hugo. The rest were perhaps fair speeches,\r\n    but there was no eloquence worthy of the occasion, and there was an\r\n    evident unreality about the Opposition. The majority had determined\r\n    not to speak. Thiers's few words were very telling; no one but\r\n    Thiers could have got so many to vote; the fear was that a great\r\n    number would abstain from voting, and so the Ratification would\r\n    either not be carried at all, or be carried by too small a majority\r\n    to pledge the country.\r\n\r\n    Chaudordy did not vote, he hankered to the last after an appeal to\r\n    the Neutral Powers. Even supposing the Germans would have given time\r\n    by prolonging the Armistice, which they certainly would not, I don't\r\n    think France would have gained anything by the appeal. Either\r\n    Bismarck would have peremptorily refused to let the Neutrals have\r\n    anything to say; or, if, _par impossible_, he had made some\r\n    concessions, he would in return of course have required them to\r\n    acquiesce explicitly in his other terms; and this, I think, would\r\n    have been as bad for France, and worse for the dignity of the\r\n    Neutrals themselves, than the present state of things. At least we\r\n    are free from any sort of sign of approval of the monstrous\r\n    conditions Prussia has imposed by sheer force.\r\n\r\n    How France is to be governed, and how the milliards are to be paid,\r\n    are hard questions. The majority of the Assembly, which is decidedly\r\n    anti-republican, hardly expects to establish a Government to its\r\n    taste, without some actual fighting with the Reds in Paris and other\r\n    large towns. It therefore does not at all like the idea of moving\r\n    the Assembly to Paris. Thiers, I think, wishes to go to Paris, or at\r\n    least to move the Assembly to some place near enough to enable the\r\n    Executive Government to be carried on in Paris. The inconveniences\r\n    of the present roving system are manifold; and I cannot help\r\n    thinking that the sooner the Government settles in the Capital, and\r\n    has its fight (if fight there really must be) with the Mob over, the\r\n    better.\r\n\r\n    As to what the New Government is to be, there would, with the\r\n    present Assembly in its present mood, be, one would think, little\r\n    difficulty in getting a large majority for a Monarchy, if the fusion\r\n    between the Legitimists and the Orleanists were once decidedly and\r\n    irrevocably made, and I suppose the Moderate Republicans would not\r\n    hold aloof from such a Government, provided it was _bonâ fide_\r\n    parliamentary. Thiers, I believe, still thinks that for the present\r\n    a Moderate Republic is the best compromise between all opinions, and\r\n    the form of Government which least disunites Frenchmen. He has now\r\n    immense influence, but the claimants of the throne and their\r\n    supporters in the Assembly seem to be already impatient; and Thiers\r\n    will have nothing but painful measures to bring forward, and will be\r\n    accused of desiring to perpetuate his own power.\r\n\r\n    I am afraid our Commercial Treaty is in the greatest danger. With\r\n    Thiers as head of the Government and as Minister of Finance, and the\r\n    popular feeling hostile to free trade and not in good humour with\r\n    England, it will be strange if we hold our own about the Treaty, or\r\n    a liberal tariff in France. It was indeed very doubtful whether the\r\n    Treaty could be maintained even under the Constitutional Empire.\r\n\r\n    Grant's Message has for the moment turned the wrath of the French\r\n    from the Neutrals to the Americans. It is strange that the\r\n    Americans, who are so abominably thin skinned themselves, never show\r\n    the least consideration for the national feelings of other Peoples.\r\n    The French are, of course, peculiarly sensitive at this moment, and\r\n    prone to resent anything like a demonstration of disregard for them.\r\n    I am truly thankful that you stopped Walker's entering Paris with\r\n    the Germans.\r\n\r\n    I have not been able to speak to Thiers since he came back, but I am\r\n    going to present my letters of Credence to him this evening.\r\n\r\nThe harshness of the peace conditions shocked Lord Granville, who\r\nthought them not only intolerable to France, but a dangerous menace to\r\nthe sacred idol of free trade.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Granville to Lord Lyons._\r\n\r\n    Foreign Office, March 1, 1871.\r\n\r\n    _Vae Victis_ indeed! How hard the conquerors have been, and what a\r\n    mistake in a great country like Germany to give up all direction of\r\n    its affairs to one bold unscrupulous man!\r\n\r\n    We do not believe in France being able to bear the burden which has\r\n    been put upon her.\r\n\r\n    I presume one of the results will be to put protectionist duties on\r\n    all imported articles. I do not think we should complain much. We\r\n    shall lose to a certain degree, but infinitesimally as compared with\r\n    France. You had better, in conversation with Thiers, and others, say\r\n    that you shall regret it on French account. They want money, which\r\n    is to be chiefly got in England. Here, rightly or wrongly, we\r\n    believe that protective duties are most injurious to the revenue to\r\n    which money-lenders look for their interest. If it is known that\r\n    Thiers means to go in for large armaments and for protection,\r\n    self-interest will shut up the hoards here.\r\n\r\nPeace having now at length been assured, there arose the question of\r\nwhere the new Assembly was to establish itself, and as there was an only\r\ntoo well-founded suspicion that Paris was no place for a conservative\r\nchamber with a hankering after a monarchy, Versailles was eventually\r\nselected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Bordeaux, March 6, 1871.\r\n\r\n    Thiers asked me yesterday whether I thought it would be advisable\r\n    for him to bring the state of affairs between France and Germany\r\n    before the Conference in London.\r\n\r\n    I did not very well see what there was to submit to the Conference,\r\n    as the preliminaries of peace were signed and could not be altered.\r\n    I thought it however better to avoid any discussion on this point,\r\n    and to say decidedly that in my opinion it would be very unadvisable\r\n    to do anything of the kind. I told him that I thought it would be a\r\n    particularly bad opportunity to take, if he wished to consult the\r\n    European Powers; that the German Plenipotentiary would say, and say\r\n    with reason, that his Government had entered into a Conference for a\r\n    specific purpose and was not to be entrapped into an extraneous\r\n    discussion, that in this view he would no doubt be strongly\r\n    supported by the Russian, and that probably none of the\r\n    Plenipotentiaries would approve of a proceeding, which would\r\n    certainly retard the business for which the Conference had met, and\r\n    might very likely break it off altogether.\r\n\r\n    I think Thiers rather asked my opinion pour 'l'acquit de sa\r\n    conscience,' than from having himself any strong desire to attempt\r\n    to bring his affairs before the Conference. At any rate he gave a\r\n    very conclusive argument against doing so himself, for he said that\r\n    it might have the effect of delaying the Prussian evacuation of the\r\n    neighbourhood of Paris.\r\n\r\n    He hopes to get the half milliard necessary to get the Prussians out\r\n    of the forts on the North side of the Seine, before the end of the\r\n    month. He speaks altogether more hopefully of the financial\r\n    prospects than any one else whom I have heard. He says Bismarck was\r\n    extremely hard about the money, and that the negociation was nearly\r\n    broken off altogether on the question of Belfort. On this question\r\n    he believes Bismarck was with him, and had a tremendous fight to\r\n    obtain leave from the Emperor and Moltke to make the concession.\r\n    Strange as it may appear Thiers seems really to have a sort of\r\n    liking for Bismarck personally, and to believe that if he had been\r\n    let have his own way by the _militaires_, he would have been much\r\n    kinder to France.\r\n\r\n    It has been generally supposed that the Assembly will adjourn to\r\n    Versailles, and St. Germain has also been mentioned; but Thiers told\r\n    me yesterday that he should himself propose Fontainebleau. He would\r\n    like himself to take it to Paris, as soon as the Prussians are out\r\n    of the forts, but the majority will not hear of putting themselves\r\n    so near the Belleville mob. I think it will be a great mistake not\r\n    to go to Paris, and I hope Thiers will pluck up a spirit, and carry\r\n    his point. He said something about being glad to have me near him at\r\n    Fontainebleau, but I do not know that it was more than a compliment.\r\n    At any rate I am myself strongly of opinion that the best thing for\r\n    me to do is to go to Paris as soon as possible, and re-establish the\r\n    Embassy there on the normal footing. If there should be (which I\r\n    doubt) any necessity for my going to Thiers or Fontainebleau or\r\n    elsewhere for more than a few hours at a time I should still propose\r\n    to have the headquarters of the Embassy in the Faubourg St. Honoré\r\n    and to treat my own occasional absence as accidental. In fact to act\r\n    as I did when invited to Compiègne in the Emperor's time. I hope to\r\n    be in Paris by the end of this week, or at latest, the beginning of\r\n    next.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador and his staff returned to Paris on March 14, finding the\r\nEmbassy quite uninjured, no traces of the siege in the neighbourhood,\r\nand the town merely looking a little duller than usual. They were\r\nenchanted to be back, and little suspected that in three or four days\r\nthey would again be driven out.\r\n\r\nPrevious attempts on the part of the Red Republicans to overthrow the\r\nGovernment of National Defence during the siege had met with failure,\r\nbut Favre's stipulation that the National Guards should be permitted to\r\nretain their arms gave the Revolutionary Party its opportunity. The new\r\nGovernment was obviously afraid to act, and matters came to a crisis\r\nwhen an ineffectual and half-hearted attempt was made to remove some\r\nguns which had been seized by National Guards. Regular troops brought up\r\nagainst the latter refused to fight and fraternized with their\r\nopponents; two generals were shot under circumstances of great\r\nbrutality, a Revolutionary Central Committee took possession of the\r\nHotel de Ville and proclaimed the Commune, and the Government withdrew\r\nsuch regular troops as remained faithful to Versailles. On March 18, the\r\ninsurgents were completely masters of the right bank of the Seine, and\r\non the following day an emissary from the French Foreign Office appeared\r\nat the Embassy with the information that the Government had been forced\r\nto retire to Versailles, and that as it was no longer able to protect\r\nthe Diplomatic Body at Paris, it was hoped that the Representatives of\r\nForeign Powers would also repair to Versailles with the least possible\r\ndelay. Nearly all of these did so at once, but Lord Lyons with his\r\npronounced sedentary tastes had had quite enough of moving about and\r\ndecided to wait for instructions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Paris, March 20, 1871.\r\n\r\n    We are in a strange state indeed. How it will end, who shall say.\r\n    The Prussians may be glad of a chance to wipe away the absurdity of\r\n    their three days' occupation by a more serious entrance, and it may\r\n    suit their rulers to put down Belleville, with a view to checking\r\n    the progress of Republicanism. I should think however it would be\r\n    wiser of them with their hatred of France, to leave the Parisians to\r\n    accomplish their own ruin.\r\n\r\n    A good many National Guards have gone out towards Versailles,\r\n    whether with the view of making a serious attack on the Government\r\n    and the Assembly remains to be seen. It seems to be doubtful whether\r\n    there are _any_ troops, except perhaps the Papal Zouaves on\r\n    whom the Government can depend.\r\n\r\n    The proclamations of the Central Committee in the _Journal\r\n    Officiel_, which I send you officially, are worth reading. They seem\r\n    to me to be in form much more calm, dignified and sensible than the\r\n    proclamations of the Government of National Defence used to be. In\r\n    substance they are not specimens of political knowledge and wisdom.\r\n\r\n    It is to be hoped that the Assembly will not make matters worse by\r\n    violent and ill-considered resolutions. I suppose it will be furious\r\n    with Thiers for having brought it to Versailles, and it is on the\r\n    cards that it may be really attacked there to-day by the Parisians.\r\n    Any way, I should not be at all surprised if the Assembly\r\n    transferred itself to some dismal French provincial town.\r\n\r\nInstructions, however, were shortly received to proceed to Versailles,\r\nand he betook himself there on the 21st, taking with him Wodehouse and\r\nSheffield, and leaving Malet, Colonel Claremont, Lascelles,[27] and\r\nSaumarez[28] at the Embassy.\r\n\r\nAt Versailles complete ignorance appeared to prevail as to the actual\r\nsituation; Jules Favre knew nothing, and either the Government had no\r\nplan or was not prepared to disclose it; but, as, at all events, during\r\nthe early stage of the conflict, railway communication with Versailles\r\nwas not interrupted, it was possible to come up to Paris occasionally at\r\nthe risk of being seized by the Communists as a spy, and see how matters\r\nwere progressing.\r\n\r\nThiers, in the early days of the Civil War affected to believe that the\r\nrevolt would speedily be brought to a satisfactory termination, and the\r\nknowledge that he personally was largely responsible for the existing\r\nsituation doubtless prompted him to minimise the danger as much as\r\npossible. By withdrawing the regular troops to Versailles, he had left\r\nthe well-disposed inhabitants of Paris at the mercy of an armed\r\nrevolutionary mob, and if a renewed bombardment or fresh Prussian\r\noccupation of the town was the result, the fault would have been largely\r\nhis. The Assembly too found itself in a ridiculous position; it had been\r\nbrought to Versailles because it had been represented that the\r\nAdministration could not be carried on away from the capital, and no\r\nsooner did it arrive at Versailles than the whole Government was driven\r\nout of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe optimism with which Thiers viewed the progress of events in Paris\r\nwas not shared by onlookers at Versailles. They could not help seeing\r\nthat the members of the Central Committee were continually gaining\r\nground, and had now obtained control of the whole or very nearly the\r\nwhole of the city: that the slaughter of the 'Men of Order' in the Rue\r\nde la Paix on March 22, had left the Red Republicans the masters of the\r\nday, and that the communal elections on March 26, had given a semblance\r\nof regular authority to the revolutionaries. Thiers, who had taken the\r\nwhole management of the affair into his own hands, and was still\r\nunwilling to use force, now endeavoured to conciliate the Communists by\r\na proclamation conceding complete recognition of the municipal\r\nfranchise, the right to elect all officers of the National Guard,\r\nincluding the Commander-in-Chief; a modification of the law on the\r\nmaturity of bills of exchange, and a prohibition to house owners and\r\nlodging-house keepers to give their lodgers notice to quit. These\r\nconcessions to blackmail were, however, considered insufficient by the\r\nimplacable revolutionary leaders, and negotiations broke down when it\r\nwas demanded that the Communal Council should supersede the Assembly\r\nwhenever the two bodies might come into collision, and that the control\r\nof finance should be vested in the former. It was evident that civil war\r\ncould no longer be avoided, and in view of the doubts which existed\r\nrespecting the reliability of the army at Versailles, the gravest\r\napprehensions were felt as to the result of the struggle. Lord Granville\r\nwas convinced that the Prussians would re-enter Paris and restore the\r\nEmpire, although the Emperor, while praising the Prussians in the course\r\nof a conversation with the Duke of Cambridge, had recently stated that\r\nno one could remain in France who was brought there by the enemy.\r\n\r\nOn March 28, the Commune was proclaimed with much pomp and emblematic\r\nceremony in which Phrygian caps were conspicuous, and a series of\r\ndecrees appeared shortly in the _Journal Officiel_, which announced the\r\nabolition of conscription, but the compulsory enrolment of all\r\nable-bodied men in the National Guard; a remission of lodger's rents;\r\nthe suspension of the sale of all articles deposited in pawn; and the\r\nsupersession of the Government at Versailles. A vast number of persons\r\nquitted the city before the end of the month, and of those who remained,\r\nthere were probably many, who, apart from their political sentiments,\r\nheartily welcomed so convenient a release from embarrassing liabilities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Versailles, March 30, 1871.\r\n\r\n    The Commune are going ahead in Paris. The great comfort the\r\n    Government and the Assembly here have, is that the similar movements\r\n    in other great towns have failed, and that thus it is plainly Paris\r\n    against all France. Their great hope appears to be that the members\r\n    of the Commune will quarrel among themselves, and that their social\r\n    measures may be so thoroughly socialist, as to rouse resistance\r\n    among the Parisians. In the meantime however the delay seems\r\n    dangerous; the working classes are said to be going over more and\r\n    more completely to the Commune, and the effect of a completely\r\n    successful revolution in Paris on the other towns may yet be\r\n    serious. Bismarck is said to have given Thiers a limited time (a\r\n    fortnight or three weeks) to set things straight, and to have\r\n    declared that, when that time is up, the Germans must step in.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the conduct of the Germans does not seem to have\r\nleft anything to be desired. They allowed the numbers of the French\r\ntroops, which had been fixed under the armistice at 40,000, to be\r\nindefinitely increased: they gave facilities for the return of the\r\nprisoners in Germany, and even gave the French Government to understand\r\nthat the assistance of German troops might be counted upon if necessary.\r\nTact is not generally supposed to be a marked German characteristic, but\r\nThiers admitted to Lord Lyons that the 'offer had been made with so much\r\ntact and delicacy, that, while of course it could not be accepted, the\r\nGovernment had been able to pass it by, without appearing to understand\r\nit.'\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, in spite of much dissatisfaction, Thiers was determined\r\nnot to be hurried, and both he and Jules Favre declined to believe\r\neither that there was any danger of excesses being committed at Paris,\r\nor that the Commune was gaining strength in consequence of the delay.\r\nThese opinions were not in the least shared by the public at large; the\r\ngeneral impression being that each day's delay added to the strength of\r\nthe Commune, discouraged the party of order and increased the\r\nexasperation of that party against the Government and the National\r\nAssembly; it was believed too that if excesses were committed they would\r\ninspire the well-disposed citizens with terror rather than with a spirit\r\nof resistance.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the cause of order, the Communists soon afforded an\r\nopportunity for testing the temper of the Versailles troops. On April 2,\r\nthe National Guards came into collision with the regulars at Courbevoic,\r\nwere heavily worsted, and such prisoners as were taken were summarily\r\nshot. The engagement showed that the army could be depended upon, and\r\nthat there need be no further fears with regard to a policy of resolute\r\nrepression; nevertheless there was little sign on the part of Thiers of\r\nfollowing up the success that had been gained, and he made the\r\nremarkable excuse that the military ignorance of the insurgents and the\r\neccentricity of their movements rendered military operations against\r\nthem correspondingly difficult. Little progress had been made towards\r\nthe end of April, although righteous retribution had overtaken Thiers in\r\nthe invasion of his house in the Place St. Georges, and in the violation\r\nby National Guards of the sanctity of the apartment of his\r\nmother-in-law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Versailles, April 21, 1871.\r\n\r\n    I suppose we shall get back to Paris, or to the ruins of it, some\r\n    day; and certainly the affairs of the Commune are looking more\r\n    gloomy than they did, but I must leave to Thiers the responsibility\r\n    of the perpetually renewed declaration that we shall be there in a\r\n    few days. The sooner it comes the better, for the delay is very\r\n    dangerous for Thiers himself and for the country. The great towns in\r\n    the south will hardly be kept under if Paris remains in rebellion\r\n    much longer, and Thiers will find it very difficult to hold back the\r\n    monarchical majority in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Versailles, April 25, 1871.\r\n\r\n    I don't hear any guns, but I suppose after what Thiers said to me\r\n    last night, that the grand attack upon Fort Issy is going on. I\r\n    shall go or send to some safe point of view, as soon as I get the\r\n    Messenger off.\r\n\r\n    It was high time to begin, for the apparent weakness of the\r\n    Government is producing lamentable effects. Colonel Playfair's\r\n    reports of the spread of a very serious insurrection in Algeria are\r\n    confirmed by recent telegrams, and there is said to be rather an\r\n    alarming movement in Savoy, not with a view to reunion with Italy,\r\n    but rather to a junction with Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    I do not trouble you with any of the programmes for the attack on\r\n    Paris which are in everybody's mouth here. The favourite notion is\r\n    that, with or without getting their half milliard, the Germans are\r\n    to give up the forts, or all of them except St. Denis, to the\r\n    French; who are then either to attack Paris on the north, or to\r\n    complete the investment of it. Military big-wigs say that Thiers has\r\n    not men enough to carry out such a plan. Financial authorities say\r\n    that he has no chance of obtaining the money till he is already\r\n    master of Paris; and Jules Favre says positively that Paris will not\r\n    be bombarded or blockaded. The value to be given to this affirmation\r\n    of Jules Favre cannot go beyond there being no _present_ intentions\r\n    to make a regular general bombardment or to reduce the place by\r\n    famine. I urge him and Thiers to give warning in time to enable\r\n    foreigners to withdraw, but I doubt the foreigners getting any\r\n    warning beyond that which Malet has given already, and I doubt the\r\n    English being persuaded to go; but I shall do all I can about it.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment, in spite of Jules Favre's assurance, took place\r\nshortly, and did infinitely more harm than that of the Germans. Amongst\r\nother buildings which suffered was the Embassy, but until the closing\r\ndays of the struggle in May, those members of the staff who had been\r\nleft there, appear to have suffered no inconvenience; and the relations\r\nof Malet with the self-constituted officials of the Commune were\r\nperfectly amicable, as far as can be judged. Malet, whose management of\r\na trying situation was marked by much good sense and tact, found no\r\ndifficulty in getting on with Paschal Grousset, the Délègué aux Affaires\r\nEtrangères (also described by his adversaries as _Etranger aux\r\nAffaires_), and his relations with this important personage were no\r\ndoubt greatly facilitated by a brother who acted as private secretary:\r\n'a very pleasant little fellow, willing to put his brother's signature\r\nto anything.' Paschal Grousset had good reason to congratulate himself\r\nsubsequently upon the pains which he had taken to ensure the safety of\r\nforeigners in Paris and for the friendly disposition which he had shown.\r\nWhen the Versailles troops obtained possession of the city, he was\r\ncaptured and would in all probability have been shot in company with\r\nother Communist leaders if unofficial representations in his favour had\r\nnot been made by Lord Lyons. He was transported, but subsequently\r\nreturned to Paris under an amnesty, and, years after, was the cause of a\r\ncomic incident at the house of a lady formerly connected with the\r\nBritish Embassy. This lady, hearing a terrific uproar in her anteroom,\r\ncame out to see what was the matter and found Paschal Grousset engaged\r\nin a violent altercation with her _maître d'hôtel_. It turned out that\r\nthe latter, who was an ex-gendarme, had been in charge of Paschal\r\nGrousset when the latter was seized by the Versailles Government, and\r\nthat he now strongly resented his former prisoner appearing in the\r\ncharacter of an ordinary visitor.\r\n\r\nOne of the most abominable acts of the Commune had been the seizure of\r\nthe Archbishop of Paris, together with a number of priests, and the\r\nholding of them as hostages for the good treatment of Communist\r\nprisoners. No secret was made of the fact that under certain\r\ncircumstances they would be shot, and efforts were set on foot by\r\nvarious parties--the American Minister, the British Government, and the\r\nGerman authorities--to prevent so horrible a catastrophe. The\r\nintervention of the American Minister, Mr. Washburne, only caused\r\nirritation. 'They are very angry here with Mr. Washburne,' wrote Lord\r\nLyons on April 28, 'for interfering about the Archbishop, and they are\r\nstill more displeased with him for being so much in Paris. In fact,\r\nalthough he has a room here he is much more in Paris than at Versailles.\r\nThiers observed to me last night that my American colleague had a\r\n_conduite très singulière_. They would not stand this in a European\r\nrepresentative, but they allow a great latitude to the American, partly\r\nbecause he and his Government have nothing to say to European politics,\r\nand partly because they cannot well help it.' An attempt made by\r\ndirection of Lord Granville met with no better success, for the\r\nVersailles Government firmly refused to make the exchange of the\r\nrevolutionary leader Blanqui, asked for by the Commune, and would only\r\ngo so far as to promise in private, that the latter's life should be\r\nspared under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Versailles, May 16, 1871.\r\n\r\n    The poor Archbishop has been constantly in my thoughts, both before\r\n    I received your letter of the 13th and since. The state of the case\r\n    is simply this. The Commune will not release him on any other terms\r\n    than the release of Blanqui; and the Government positively refuses\r\n    to give up Blanqui. Every one agrees that intervention with the\r\n    Commune is worse than useless; in fact does harm. You will see from\r\n    my Confidential Despatch of to-day, that I have gone as far as\r\n    possible with Thiers on the subject, but without success. I cannot\r\n    hope that I have done any good, but I have certainly done no harm.\r\n    Thiers spoke to me freely and confidentially, but absolutely refused\r\n    (or rather said positively that it was impossible) to give up\r\n    Blanqui. I perhaps went rather far in speaking to M. Thiers even in\r\n    the way I did, but I think it will be a comfort to remember that we\r\n    did all that could be done.\r\n\r\n    I understand that the Archbishop does not suffer any positive\r\n    hardship or privation beyond being kept a close prisoner, but I fear\r\n    his health is giving way in some degree under the pressure of\r\n    anxiety and confinement.\r\n\r\n    Perhaps the most painful feature in the whole matter has been the\r\n    conduct of the Vicar General, the Abbé Lagarde, who was sent to\r\n    Versailles on parole to negociate the release of the Archbishop.\r\n    Notwithstanding the entreaties of the Archbishop himself, and the\r\n    exhortations of everyone here, he declined to redeem his promise and\r\n    has thereby materially injured the Archbishop's position, and given\r\n    force to the Communist pretext that no trust can be put in priests.\r\n    I am afraid he is still out of Paris.\r\n\r\nJules Favre was also approached on the subject, but nothing could be got\r\nout of him, and the only chance of success seemed to depend upon a\r\nperemptory demand of the Germans for his release, the Commune being\r\ncompletely at their mercy. This action the German authorities found\r\nthemselves unable to take, and in spite of the frequently expressed\r\nopinions of Thiers and others that the lives of the hostages were in no\r\nreal danger, they were all massacred in cold blood during the final days\r\nof the street fighting.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of May, most people were of opinion that there was nothing\r\nto prevent the troops entering Paris whenever they pleased, and that the\r\nsooner they did so, the less resistance they would encounter. Thiers,\r\nhowever, still refused to run any risks, and it was not until nearly the\r\nclose of the month that the insurrection was completely suppressed,\r\namidst scenes almost unprecedented in modern times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Lord Lyons to Lord Granville._\r\n\r\n    Versailles, May 26, 1871.\r\n\r\n    The state of Paris is heart-breaking. The night I spent there (24th)\r\n    was calculated to give one an idea of the infernal regions. Fires in\r\n    all directions, the air oppressive with smoke and unpleasant odours,\r\n    the incessant roar of cannon and musketry and all kinds of strange\r\n    sounds. For the 48 hours before my arrival, the members of the\r\n    Embassy and all in the house were in imminent danger; a fire raging\r\n    in the next street but one, shells falling on the roof which might\r\n    set fire to the house at any moment, and shot flying so fast on both\r\n    sides that escape in case of fire would have been hardly possible.\r\n    It is a great satisfaction to me that every one in the house behaved\r\n    well. Of the members of the Embassy I was quite sure, and all the\r\n    men servants appeared to have shown pluck and alacrity in rushing to\r\n    the places where the shells fell, in order to extinguish the fire in\r\n    case of need. Malet has a first-rate head, and directed everything\r\n    with his usual coolness and self-possession.\r\n\r\n    One bit of a shell is said to have fallen in the garden yesterday\r\n    morning, but it certainly did no mischief, and there was no\r\n    appearance of danger while I was there. I cannot, however, feel\r\n    quite comfortable so long as the insurgents hold the Buttes de\r\n    Chaumont. They must, I should hope, be on the point of being driven\r\n    out at the moment I write. Little or no intelligence of what was\r\n    going on in the town could be obtained. The least inconvenience on\r\n    leaving one's own house was to be seized upon to form a chain to\r\n    hand buckets. Sentries stopped our progress in almost every\r\n    direction: arrests were frequent and summary executions the order of\r\n    the day. I hope it will really all be over by to-night. Sad as it\r\n    all is, I felt a satisfaction in finding myself in the old house\r\n    again, and am impatient to return to it for good. I hope to do so\r\n    directly I can without cutting myself off from uninterrupted\r\n    communication with you.\r\n\r\n    The fate of the hostages is what makes me the most anxious now. All\r\n    the accounts we do receive are hopeful, but we have no positive\r\n    assurance of their being safe. The Nuncio came back from his\r\n    expedition to the Crown Prince of Saxony much pleased with himself\r\n    for having undertaken it, and very grateful to me for having\r\n    suggested it. He was referred by the Crown Prince to General\r\n    Fabrice, who told him, that by order of Prince Bismarck, he was\r\n    doing all that could be done to save the Archbishop. He even hinted\r\n    that he had tried offers of money.\r\n\r\n    Thiers is trying the patience of the Assembly by keeping in office\r\n    Jules Favre, Picard and Jules Simon, who were members of the\r\n    Government of National Defence and of the violent Republican\r\n    opposition under the Empire. The contempt and disgust of the\r\n    Parisians of every shade of opinion for the Government of National\r\n    Defence appears unbounded. They consider it to have been a\r\n    Government which had neither courage nor capacity, and was equally\r\n    inefficient in defending the city against the enemy, and maintaining\r\n    order and authority inside. By the country at large, and still more,\r\n    by the monarchical representatives in the Assembly, the members of\r\n    that Government, by their conduct before and after the 4th September\r\n    are held to have been the cause of all the present horrors.\r\n\r\n    Notwithstanding all this, Thiers seems to rule the Assembly\r\n    completely, however much the members may grumble in private. His\r\n    troubles with them will begin when Paris is at last subdued.\r\n\r\n    I went to Favre with the offer of the firemen directly the telegram\r\n    was decyphered. He took it up to Thiers who immediately accepted it.\r\n\r\nThe Commune, which terminated in an orgy of blood, flame, and insensate\r\nfury, had lasted for rather more than two months. Amongst those who\r\noriginated the movement were some who honestly believed that they were\r\nmerely advocating municipal freedom, and others who thought that the\r\nexistence of the Republic was threatened by a reactionary Assembly; but\r\nthe control eventually fell into the hands of revolutionaries whose aim\r\nit was to destroy the foundations of society. It showed human nature at\r\nits worst, and the ferocity of the reprisals on the part of the\r\nGovernment created almost as much repulsion as the outrages which had\r\nprovoked them. Now, however, with the restoration of order, a new era\r\nwas about to dawn; the ceaseless disasters which had overwhelmed the\r\ncountry since the end of July, 1870, had come to an end, and within an\r\nalmost incredibly short period, France recovered that place amongst the\r\ngreat nations of the world, which seemed at one time to have been\r\nirretrievably lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [23] Representative at Tours of the French Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n  [24] 'Memoirs of Sir Robert Morier.'\r\n\r\n  [25] Minister at Madrid; subsequently Ambassador at Constantinople.\r\n\r\n  [26] Col. the Honble.

The interest of this work lies, however, less in the\r\npersonality of the Ambassador than in the highly important events in\r\nwhich he played so prominent a part.\r\n\r\nLord Lyons was the British representative at Washington during the\r\nperiod of the Civil War; subsequently he was Ambassador at\r\nConstantinople for two years; and finally he spent twenty years--from\r\n1867 to 1887--as Ambassador at Paris. During the whole of this eventful\r\nperiod his advice was constantly sought by the Home Government upon\r\nevery foreign question of importance, and his correspondence throws\r\nfresh light upon obscure passages in diplomatic history.\r\n\r\nIn this book will be found hitherto unpublished information relating to\r\nsuch matters as the critical relations between England and the United\r\nStates during the course of the Civil War; the political situation in\r\nFrance during the closing years of the Second Empire; the secret attempt\r\nmade by the British Foreign Secretary to avert the Franco-German War,\r\nand the explanation of its failure; the internal and external policy of\r\nFrance during the early years of the Third Republic; the War Scare of\r\n1875; the Congress of Berlin; the Egyptian Expedition; Anglo-French\r\npolitical relations, and many other matters of interest.\r\n\r\nThe method selected by the writer has been to reproduce all important\r\ncorrespondence verbatim, and it may be confidently asserted that the\r\nstudent of foreign politics will find in this work a valuable record of\r\nmodern diplomatic history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLONDON: EDWARD ARNOLD. 41 & 43 MADDOX STREET W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE AND LETTERS OF GEORGE WILLIAM FREDERICK, FOURTH EARL OF\r\nCLARENDON.\r\n\r\nBy the Right Hon. Sir HERBERT MAXWELL, Bart.\r\n\r\n_In Two Volumes, With Portraits. Demy 8vo._ =30s. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn in the year 1800 and dying in 1870, Lord Clarendon lived through a\r\nperiod of social, political, and economic change more rapid probably\r\nthan had been witnessed in any similar space of time in the previous\r\nhistory of mankind. It was his lot, moreover, to wield considerable\r\ninfluence over the course of affairs, inasmuch as his public service,\r\nextending over fifty years, caused him to be employed in a succession of\r\nhighly responsible, and even critical, situations. British Minister at\r\nMadrid at the outbreak and during the course of the Carlist Civil War\r\nfrom 1833 to 1839, he was admitted into Lord Melbourne's Cabinet\r\nimmediately upon returning to England in the latter year. He was Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland throughout the memorable famine years, 1847-1852.\r\nRelieved of that arduous post, Lord Clarendon entered Lord Aberdeen's\r\ngovernment in 1852 as Foreign Secretary, which office he retained\r\nthrough the Crimean War, and became responsible for the terms of the\r\nTreaty of Paris in 1856. On Lord Palmerston's death in 1865, he returned\r\nto the Foreign Office, and had to deal with the settlement of the\r\n\"Alabama\" claims.\r\n\r\nThe annals of the first half of Queen Victoria's reign having been\r\npretty thoroughly explored and dealt with by many competent writers, the\r\nchief interest in these pages will be found in Lord Clarendon's private\r\ncorrespondence, which has been well preserved, and has been entrusted to\r\nSir Herbert Maxwell for the purpose of this memoir. Lord Clarendon was\r\na fluent and diligent correspondent; Charles Greville and others among\r\nhis contemporaries frequently expressed a hope that his letters should\r\nsome day find their way into literature. Sir Arthur Helps, for instance,\r\nwrote as follows in _Macmillan's Magazine_: \"Lord Clarendon was a man\r\nwho indulged, notwithstanding his public labours, in an immense private\r\ncorrespondence. There were some persons to whom, I believe, he wrote\r\ndaily, and perhaps in after years we shall be favoured--those of us who\r\nlive to see it--with a correspondence which will enlighten us as to many\r\nof the principal topics of our own period.\" It is upon this\r\ncorrespondence that Sir Herbert Maxwell has chiefly relied in tracing\r\nthe motives, principles, and conduct of one of the last Whig statesmen.\r\nAmong the letters dealt with, and now published for the first time, are\r\nthose from Lord Melbourne, Lord Palmerston, Lord Aberdeen, Lord Derby,\r\nM. Thiers, M. Guizot, the Emperor Louis Napoleon, etc., and many ladies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM AUGUSTUS, DUKE OF CUMBERLAND, HIS EARLY LIFE AND TIMES, 1721-1748.\r\n\r\nBy the Hon. EVAN CHARTERIS,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"AFFAIRS OF SCOTLAND, 1744-1746.\"\r\n\r\n_With Plans and Illustrations._ =12s. 6d. net.= [_In preparation._\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Charteris has a good subject in \"Butcher\" Cumberland, not only on\r\naccount of the historical and romantic interest of his background, but\r\nalso by reason of the Duke's baneful reputation.\r\n\r\nIn the present volume the author has carried the career of the Duke of\r\nCumberland down to the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. The period includes the\r\nDuke's campaigns in Flanders against Marshal Saxe, the Battle of\r\nCulloden, and the measures taken for the suppression of the Jacobites in\r\nScotland. Mr. Charteris has had the exceptional advantage of studying\r\nthe Cumberland Papers at Windsor Castle, and it is largely by the aid of\r\nhitherto unpublished documents that he is now able to throw fresh light\r\non a character which has been the subject of so much malevolent\r\ncriticism. At the same time the volume deals with the social and\r\npolitical conditions among which Cumberland was called on to play so\r\nimportant a part in the life of the nation. These have been treated by\r\nthe author with some fulness of detail. Cumberland, in spite of his\r\nforeign origin, was remarkably typical of the characteristics of the\r\nearlier Georgian period, and an endeavour has been made in the present\r\nvolume to establish the link between the Duke and the politics, the\r\nmorals, the aims, and the pursuits of the age in which he lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY ART AND MY FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nTHE REMINISCENCES OF SIR F. H. COWEN.\r\n\r\n_With Portrait. Demy 8vo._ =10s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of a long and distinguished musical career, Sir Frederic\r\nCowen has had opportunities of visiting many parts of the world, of\r\nmeeting all the most eminent artists of the last half-century, and of\r\namassing material for an extremely diverting volume of personal\r\nrecollections. As a child he enjoyed the privilege of being embraced by\r\nthe great Piccolomini; as a young man he toured with Trebelli, and\r\nbecame acquainted with the famous Rubinstein, with Bülow, and with\r\nJoachim. In later life he numbered such well-known musicians as\r\nPachmann, Paderewski, Sir Arthur Sullivan, and the de Reszkes, among his\r\nfriends. Nor was the circle of his intimates entirely confined to the\r\nworld of music; he was on terms of the closest friendship with Corney\r\nGrain, with George Grossmith and Arthur Cecil; he capped the puns of\r\nHenry J. Byron and Sir Francis Burnand; he laughed at the practical\r\njokes of Toole, at the caricatures which Phil May drew for him of his\r\nfriends. To the public Sir Frederick Cowen is well known as the\r\nconductor of Covent Garden Promenade and Philharmonic Concerts, as the\r\ncomposer of such celebrated songs as \"The Better Land\" and \"The Promise\r\nof Life,\" of \"The Corsair\" and \"The Butterfly's Ball.\" In these pages he\r\nshows himself to be a keen but kindly student of human nature, who can\r\ndescribe the various experiences of his past life with a genial but\r\nhumorous pen. The inexhaustible fund of anecdote from which he draws\r\ntends still further to enliven an amusing and lively volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CIVIL SERVANT IN BURMA.\r\n\r\nBy Sir HERBERT THIRKELL WHITE, K.C.I.E.\r\n\r\n_With 16 Pages of Illustrations. Demy 8vo._ =12s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Herbert Thirkell White, who has but recently retired from the post\r\nof Lieutenant-Governor of Burma, which he filled with ability and\r\ndistinction, has now written what he modestly calls a \"plain story\" of\r\nmore than thirty years of official life in India. In this volume are\r\nnarrated the experiences of an Indian Civilian who has devoted the best\r\npart of his existence to the service of the Empire, and is in a position\r\nto speak with assurance of the many complicated problems with which the\r\nwhite man in India is continually faced. Sir Herbert's acquaintance with\r\nBurma began in 1878; since then he has had every opportunity of judging\r\nthe peculiar habits, customs, and characteristics of the native Burmese,\r\nand has been able to compile a valuable record of the impressions they\r\nhave made upon his mind. It was his fate to hold official positions of\r\nincreasing importance during the Viceroyalties of Lord Ripon, Lord\r\nDufferin, and Lord Curzon; he was privileged to serve such distinguished\r\nchiefs as Sir Charles Bernard and Sir Charles Crosthwaite, and witnessed\r\nthat pacification of Burma which the last-named Chief Commissioner has\r\ndescribed so eloquently in his well-known book on the subject. Sir\r\nHerbert writes clearly and with knowledge of every aspect of Burmese\r\nlife and character, and this volume of his recollections should prove\r\nextremely popular among English readers who are interested in the\r\ngovernment of our Indian Empire and the daily routine of the Indian\r\nCivil Servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRTY YEARS IN KASHMIR.\r\n\r\nBy ARTHUR NEVE, F.R.C.S.E.\r\n\r\n_With Illustrations and a Map. Demy 8vo._ =12s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stupendous natural surroundings amidst which they dwell have\r\ninspired sojourners in Kashmir and other Himalayan countries to produce\r\nsome of the finest books of travel to be found. Among them will have to\r\nbe included in future this book of Dr. Arthur Neve's, so effectively\r\ndoes the author reveal the wonders of the land of towering peaks and\r\nhuge glaciers where he has made his home for the last thirty years.\r\n\r\nGoing out to Kashmir in 1882 under the auspices of the Church Missionary\r\nSociety, Dr. Neve took over the charge of the Kashmir Mission Hospital\r\nat Srinagur from Dr. Edmund Downes, who was retiring, and has stayed\r\nthere ever since. In his earlier chapters he gives some account of the\r\nPunjab and Kashmir in the eighties, and also of the work of the mission.\r\nHe then gets to the principal motif of the book--the exploring tours and\r\nmountaineering expeditions to which he has devoted his spare time.

L. HAUGHTON.\r\n\r\n(36TH SIKHS.)\r\n\r\n_With Illustrations from the Author's Photographs. One Volume._\r\n\r\n_Demy 8vo._ =12s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Haughton has written a book which should prove a welcome\r\naddition to the library of every sportsman, as well as being of supreme\r\ninterest to the naturalist and the student of folk-lore. On the subject\r\nof sport the author writes with that thorough insight and sympathy which\r\nare the fruits of many years' practical experience with rod and rifle,\r\nin the jungle, on river-bank or mountain-side. In his agreeable society\r\nthe reader may stalk the markhor or the ibex, lightly throw his \"Sir\r\nRichard\" across some Kashmiri trout-stream, or lie in wait for the\r\nHimalayan black bear on its way to feed; and if the author's description\r\nof his many amusing and exciting adventures and experiences is eminently\r\nreadable, the value of his work is still further enhanced by his\r\nintimate knowledge of natural history, and by the introduction of many\r\nof those old Indian legendary tales that he has culled from the lips of\r\nnative Shikaris round the camp-fire at night. The book is illustrated\r\nthroughout with a series of remarkably interesting photographs taken by\r\nthe author in the course of his many sporting expeditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOLLECTIONS OF A PENINSULAR VETERAN.\r\n\r\nBy the late Lieut.-Colonel JOSEPH ANDERSON, C.B., K.H.\r\n\r\n_With Photogravure Portrait. Demy 8vo._ =10s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Lieut.-Colonel Joseph Anderson was born in 1790, and from the\r\nage of fifteen, when he received a commission as Ensign in the 78th\r\nRegiment, to within a few years of his death in 1877, his career was\r\nalmost continuously as adventurous as it was distinguished. In 1806 he\r\nsaw active service for the first time, when he took part in the\r\nexpedition to Calabria; in the following year he served in the Egyptian\r\nCampaign of that date; and during the Peninsular War he fought at the\r\nbattles of Maida, Busaco, Fuentes d'Onoro, was wounded at Talavera, and\r\naccompanied Wellington on the retreat to the lines of Torres Vedras. A\r\nfew years later Captain Anderson, now a Captain in the York Chasseurs,\r\nwas sent with his regiment to Barbadoes, and was present at the capture\r\nof Guadeloupe in 1815. He was appointed Colonel Commandant of the Penal\r\nSettlement at Norfolk Island in 1834, where his humane endeavours to\r\nreform the prevailing penal system, and his efforts to quell mutinous\r\nconvicts, met with marked success. Nine years later Colonel Anderson\r\nwent to India to take part in the Mahratta Campaign, and at the Battle\r\nof Punniar (where he commanded a Brigade) was severely wounded when\r\ncharging the enemy's guns. After retiring from the Service, Colonel\r\nAnderson settled down in Australia, and it was at his home near\r\nMelbourne that these memories were compiled, during the later years of a\r\nstrenuous and active life, for the edification of his family. They are\r\nwritten in a simple, unaffected style, which renders them peculiarly\r\nreadable, and form a most instructive record of the manners and customs,\r\nof the mode of warfare, and the military and social life of a past age,\r\nand a bygone generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORIES OF A SOLDIER'S LIFE.\r\n\r\nBy Major-General Sir H. M. BENGOUGH, K.C.B.\r\n\r\n_With Portrait. Demy 8vo._ =8s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor-General Sir H. M. Bengough joined the army in 1855, and retired in\r\n1898, after more than forty years of distinguished service in all\r\nquarters of the Empire. His first experience of active warfare dates\r\nfrom the Crimea; later on he took the field in the Zulu War and the\r\nBurma Expedition of 1885. In days of peace he held various high commands\r\nin India, South Africa, and Jamaica, and finally commanded a brigade of\r\ninfantry at Aldershot. In this volume of personal recollections the\r\nauthor narrates the many varied incidents and experiences of a long\r\nmilitary career and vividly describes the campaigns in which he took\r\npart. He also gives an interesting account of his adventures in the\r\nrealm of sport--pig-sticking, tiger-shooting, and pursuing other forms\r\nof game in India and elsewhere; subjects upon which a long experience\r\nenables him to write with expert knowledge. It will be strange indeed if\r\nso interesting an autobiographical volume from the pen of a deservedly\r\npopular soldier and sportsman fails to appeal to a wide public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZACHARY STOYANOFF.\r\n\r\nPages from the Autobiography of a Bulgarian Insurgent.\r\n\r\nTranslated by M. POTTER.\r\n\r\n_One Volume. Demy 8vo._ =10s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this volume Zachary Stoyanoff gives us the narrative of his personal\r\nexperiences during the Bulgarian outbreaks of 1875 and 1876. Almost by\r\naccident he became an \"apostle\" of rebellion, and was sent out forthwith\r\nto range the country, stirring up the villagers and forming local\r\ncommittees. It is an amazing story. With unsurpassable candour he\r\nportrays for us the leaders, their enthusiasm, their incredible\r\nshortsightedness, and the pitiful inadequacy of their preparations. The\r\nbubble burst, and after a miserable attempt at flight, Stoyanoff was\r\ntaken prisoner and sent to Philippopolis for trial. There is no attempt\r\nat heroics. With the same Boswellian simplicity he reveals his fears,\r\nhis cringing, his mendacity, and incidentally gives us a graphic\r\npicture, not wholly black, of the conquering Turk. The narrative ends\r\nabruptly while he is still in peril of his life. One is glad to know\r\nthat, somehow, he escaped. A very human document, and a remarkable\r\ncontrast to the startling exhibition of efficiency given to the world by\r\nthe Bulgarians in their latest struggle with the Turks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLENDID FAILURES.\r\n\r\nBy HARRY GRAHAM,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"A GROUP OF SCOTTISH WOMEN,\" \"THE MOTHER OF PARLIAMENTS,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n_With Portraits. Demy 8vo._ =10s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps unlikely that any two individuals will agree as to the\r\nproper definition of the term \"A Splendid Failure\"--a phrase of which\r\nthe origin would appear to be obscure. It may, however, be roughly\r\nstated that the \"Splendid Failures\" of the past divide themselves\r\nnaturally into three classes: those whom their contemporaries invested\r\nwith a fictitious or exaggerated splendour which posterity is quite\r\nunable to comprehend or appreciate; those whom the modern world regards\r\nwith admiration--but who signally failed in impressing the men of their\r\nown generation; and those who, gifted with genius and inspired with\r\nlofty ideals, never justified the world's high opinion of their talents\r\nor fulfilled the promise of their early days. In this volume of\r\nbiographical essays, the author of \"A Group of Scottish Women\" and other\r\npopular works has dealt with a selection of \"splendid failures\" of whose\r\npersonal history the public knows but little, though well acquainted\r\nwith their names. Wolfe Tone, \"the first of the Fenians\"; Benjamin\r\nHaydon, the \"Cockney Raphael\"; Toussaint L'Ouverture, the \"Napoleon of\r\nSan Domingo\"; William Betty, the \"Infant Roscius\"; and \"Champagne\"\r\nTownshend, the politician of Pitt's day, may be included under this\r\ncategory. The reader cannot fail to be interested in that account which\r\nthe author gives of the ill-fated Archduke Maximilian's attempt to found\r\na Mexican monarchy; in his careful review of the work and character of\r\nHartley Coleridge; and in his biographical study of George Smythe, that\r\nfriend of Disraeli whom the statesman-novelist took as his model for the\r\nhero of \"Coningsby.\" This book, which should appeal strongly to all\r\nreaders of literary essays, is illustrated with eight excellent\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORINTHIAN YACHTSMAN'S HANDBOOK.\r\n\r\nBy FRANCIS B. COOKE.\r\n\r\n_With 20 Folding Plates of Designs for Yachts, and numerous black and\r\nwhite Illustrations. Demy 8vo._ =10s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new handbook covers the sport of yachting in all its branches. The\r\nwriter, who has had many years' experience of cruising and racing in\r\nyachts and boats of all types, has treated the subject in a thoroughly\r\npractical manner. The book is divided into six parts.\r\n\r\nIn Part I., which deals with the selection of a yacht, the various types\r\nand rigs suitable for Corinthian yachting are discussed. The designing\r\nand building of new craft are also dealt with at some length, and\r\ndesigns and descriptions of a number of up-to-date small cruisers are\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nIn Part II. some hints are given as to where to station the yacht. All\r\navailable headquarters within easy reach of London are described, and\r\nthe advantages and disadvantages of each pointed out.\r\n\r\nPart III. is devoted to the equipment of yachts, and contains a wealth\r\nof information as to the internal arrangement, rigging, and fittings of\r\nsmall cruisers.\r\n\r\nPart IV. treats of the maintenance of small cruising vessels, with notes\r\non the cost of upkeep, fitting out and laying up. Other matters dealt\r\nwith in this section are the preservation of sails and gear, and\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\nPart V., on seamanship, covers the handling of fore-and-aft vessels\r\nunder all conditions of weather, and upon every point of sailing.\r\n\r\nPart VI. covers the racing side of the sport in a comprehensive manner.\r\nAn exhaustive exposition of the International Sailing Rules is followed\r\nby hints on racing tactics. The appendix contains, _inter alia_, an\r\nillustrated description of the British Buoyage System.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooke's well-known handbooks have come to be regarded by yachtsmen\r\nas standard works, and a new and more ambitious work from his pen can\r\nhardly fail to interest them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF PROTECTION.\r\n\r\nBy BERNARD HOLLAND, C.B.,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"IMPERIUM ET LIBERTAS.\"\r\n\r\n_One Volume. Demy 8vo._ =12s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume is a political-historical study of the great change which\r\ntook place in British commercial and financial policy mainly between the\r\nyears 1840 and 1850. The writer examines the state of things in these\r\nrespects which existed before this revolution, and describes the\r\nprevious protective system, navigation system, and colonial system. He\r\nthen narrates the process by which those systems were overthrown,\r\ndevoting special attention to the character, career, and changes in\r\nopinion of Sir Robert Peel, and to the attitude and action of the Tory,\r\nWhig, and Radical parties, and of their leading men, especially Mr.\r\nDisraeli, Lord John Russell, and Mr. Cobden. He analyses with care the\r\narguments used on all sides in these controversies, especially with\r\nregard to the Repeal of the Corn Laws, and he shows the extent to which\r\nquestions of imperial preference and the relations between the United\r\nKingdom and the Colonies entered into the issues. One chapter is devoted\r\nto the Bank Act of 1844, and to the consideration of its causes and\r\nresults. The author concludes by tracing very briefly the chain of\r\nevents which connect the period in question with our own day, in respect\r\nof commercial and fiscal policy, and expresses his own views as to\r\nexisting tendencies and future developments.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernard Holland is known as the author of the Life of the Duke of\r\nDevonshire, and of \"Imperium et Libertas.\" In a sense the present volume\r\nis a continuation of the latter book, or rather is an attempt to deal\r\nmore expansively and in detail with certain history and questions\r\nconnected with the same theme, for the full treatment of which there was\r\ninsufficient space in that book. Mr. Holland having acted for a number\r\nof years as Private Secretary to two successive Secretaries of State for\r\nthe Colonies, has been brought into close touch in a practical way with\r\ncolonial questions. This book, it is hoped, will be of some service both\r\nto students of economic history and to politicians in active life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING IN THE FAR EAST.\r\n\r\nBy LAURENCE BINYON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A New Edition, thoroughly Revised, with many new and additional\r\nIllustrations. Crown 4to._ =21s. net.=\r\n\r\nSince the first edition of this book was published in 1907, much has\r\nhappened, and a quantity of new material has been brought to light.\r\n\r\nInterest in the subject has been immensely widened and strengthened. The\r\nmuseums of Europe and America are vying with each other to procure fine\r\nspecimens of Chinese and Japanese art. The opening this autumn of a new\r\nmuseum at Cologne, exclusively devoted to the arts of Eastern Asia, is a\r\nsymptom of the times. Collections, public and private, both European and\r\nAmerican, have been greatly enriched; and the exhibition in 1910 at\r\nShepherd's Bush, of treasured masterpieces lent from Japanese\r\ncollections, has provided a standard for the student.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, again, scarcely any of the voluminous literature of art\r\nexisting in Chinese and Japanese had been translated. On this side, too,\r\nan added store of information has been made accessible, though still in\r\ngreat part scattered in the pages of learned periodicals. Above all, the\r\nmarvellous discoveries made of recent years in China and Chinese\r\nTurkestan have substituted a mass of authentic material for groping\r\nconjectures in the study of the art of the early periods.\r\n\r\nIn preparing a new edition of this book and bringing it up to date, Mr.\r\nBinyon has therefore been able to utilize a variety of new sources of\r\ninformation. The estimates given of the art of some of the most famous\r\nof the older masters have been reconsidered. The sections dealing with\r\nthe early art have been in great measure rewritten; and the book has\r\nbeen revised throughout. In the matter of illustrations it has been\r\npossible to draw on a wider range and make a fuller and more\r\nrepresentative selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING IN EAST AND WEST.\r\n\r\nBy ROBERT DOUGLAS NORTON,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"THE CHOICE.\"\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo._ =5s. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of painting, which in the days of Gothic church-building\r\ncontributed so much both to the education and the pleasure of the\r\ncommunity at large, has admittedly come to appeal to ever-narrowing\r\ncircles, until to-day it cannot be said to play any part in popular life\r\nat all. This book seeks to discover the causes of its decline in\r\ninfluence. A brief review of the chief contemporary movements in painting\r\ngives point to a suggestion made by more than one thoughtful critic that\r\nthe chief need of Western painting is spirituality. Since this is a\r\nquality which those competent to judge are at one in attributing to\r\nEastern art, the author, in a chapter on Far Eastern Painting, sets\r\nforth the ideals underlying the great painting of China and Japan, and\r\ncontrasts these ideals with those which have inspired painters and\r\npublic in the West. This leads to an inquiry into the uses of\r\nimagination and suggestion in art, and to an attempt to find a broad\r\nenough definition for \"spirituality\" not to exclude many widely\r\ndivergent achievements of Western painting. Finally, the possibility of\r\ntraining the sense of beauty is discussed in the light of successful\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nIncidentally the book touches on many questions which, though of\r\ninterest to picture-lovers, often remain unasked; such, for instance, as\r\nwhat we look for in a picture; how far subject is important; why it may\r\nhappen that the interest of one picture, which pleases at first, soon\r\nwanes, while that of another grows steadily stronger; the value of\r\ntechnique, of different media of expression, of mere resemblance, etc.\r\n\r\nWithout going into the technicalities of æsthetics, the author aims at\r\ninvestigating certain first principles which are overlooked at times by\r\npossessors of even the widest knowledge of individual schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE'S STORIES.\r\n\r\nBy CONSTANCE MAUD and MARY MAUD.\r\n\r\nAS YOU LIKE IT--THE TEMPEST--KING LEAR--TWELFTH NIGHT--THE MERCHANT\r\nOF VENICE--A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM--MACBETH--HAMLET--ROMEO AND JULIET.\r\n\r\n_With Illustrations from the famous Boydell prints.

In the present volume she\r\ntells the charming stories of nine of the most famous of Shakespeare's\r\nTragedies and Comedies in prose of delightful and unstudied simplicity.\r\nOn occasion the actual text has been used for familiar passages and\r\nphrases. These great world-tales, regarded merely as tales, with the\r\nelemental motives and passions displayed in them, appeal strongly to the\r\nimagination, and when narrated by a competent pen there cannot be finer\r\nor more absorbing reading. In addition to this, he must be a dull reader\r\nin whom they do not awaken a desire to make a closer acquaintance with\r\nthe plays themselves.\r\n\r\nThe book forms a companion volume to Sir A. T. Quiller-Couch's\r\nwell-known \"Historical Tales from Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUSE IN MOTLEY.\r\n\r\nBy HARRY GRAHAM.\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"RUTHLESS RHYMES FOR HEARTLESS HOMES,\" ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\n_With 24 Illustrations by_\r\n\r\nLEWIS BAUMER.\r\n\r\n_Fcap. 4vo._ =3s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nAll lovers of humorous verse will welcome a fresh volume of lyrics by\r\nthe author of \"Deportmental Ditties,\" \"Canned Classics,\" and other\r\ndeservedly popular products of the Minor Muse. Readers of Captain\r\nGraham's new collection of light verse will agree with the _Daily\r\nChronicle_ in describing its author as \"a godsend, a treasure trove, a\r\nmessenger from Olympus; a man who really does see the ludicrous side of\r\nlife, a man who is a genuine humorist.\" Once again the author of these\r\namusing poems attempts to \"shoot Folly as she flies,\" and genially\r\nsatirizes the foibles of the age in a fashion that will certainly add to\r\nhis reputation as a humorist; and his work is rendered still more\r\ndelightful by the drawings of Mr. Lewis Baumer, the well-known _Punch_\r\nartist, with which it is lavishly illustrated. \"It is a great and good\r\nthing,\" as the _Pall Mall Gazette_ remarked with reference to another of\r\nCaptain Graham's books, \"to have a man among us who is witty all the\r\ntime and lets himself go.

Mr. Freshfield has a solution of his own, which,\r\nhowever, he puts forward in no dogmatic spirit, but in such a fashion\r\nthat his book is practically a lucid review of the whole matter in each\r\nof its many aspects. To an extensive acquaintance with ancient and\r\nmodern geographical literature he unites a wide and varied experience as\r\nan alpine climber and a traveller, and a minute topographical knowledge\r\nof the regions under discussion; and these qualifications--in which many\r\nof his predecessors in the same field of inquiry have been conspicuously\r\nlacking--enable him to throw much new light on a perennially fascinating\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PASTORAL TEACHING OF ST. PAUL.\r\n\r\nBy the Rev. Canon H. L. GOUDGE,\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL OF THE THEOLOGICAL COLLEGE, ELY; AUTHOR OF \"THE MIND OF ST.\r\nPAUL,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo. Cloth._ =2s. 6d. net.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThese lectures were delivered at the end of May, 1913, at the Palace,\r\nGloucester, to the clergy of the diocese, and are now published in\r\nresponse to the request of those who heard them. They do not constitute\r\na detailed commentary on the Pastoral Epistles, though a good deal of\r\ndetailed exegesis necessarily finds a place in them. The writer's aim\r\nhas been to collect and arrange St. Paul's teaching as to the work of\r\nthe Christian pastor, and to point out its applicability to modern\r\nconditions and modern difficulties. The writer has often found, through\r\nhis experience in conducting Retreats, that the Pastoral Teaching of St.\r\nPaul is of the greatest value to the clergy to-day, but that this\r\nteaching is often obscured by the unsystematic character of St. Paul's\r\nwriting and by the passing controversies with which he has to deal. In\r\nthese lectures the First Epistle to Timothy is used as the basis, but\r\ncontinually illustrated by passages from the other Pastoral Epistles,\r\nand from St. Paul's earlier writings. The first lecture deals with the\r\npastor's aim, the second with the pastor's character, the third with the\r\npastor's work, and the fourth with the adaptation of his message to men\r\nand to women, to old and to young, to rich and to poor. The ground\r\nalready covered by the writer's earlier book, \"The Mind of St. Paul,\"\r\nhas been carefully avoided, but it is hoped that the one book may throw\r\nlight upon the other. An index of texts has been added for those who may\r\nwish to use this second book, as far as that is possible, as a\r\ncommentary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NEW NOVELS_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETHING AFAR.\r\n\r\nBy MAXWELL GRAY,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"THE SILENCE OF DEAN MAITLAND,\" \"THE GREAT REFUSAL,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo. Cloth._ =6s.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scene of Maxwell Gray's new story is laid in London and in Italy,\r\nwhere the gradual unfolding of an elaborate but absorbing plot holds the\r\nreader's attention until the very last page of the book. This is a tale\r\nof heroism, of self-sacrifice, of romance, full of incident and\r\nadventure, illumined by those tender and imaginative touches, that vivid\r\nportrayal of character, which the public has learnt to expect from the\r\nauthor of \"The Silence of Dean Maitland.\" From these pages we may learn\r\nthat there is \"something afar from the sphere of our sorrow,\" the\r\nhighest aspiration of the lover, the artist, the poet and the saint,\r\nwhich, beautiful beyond all that man's heart can divine, is yet within\r\nthe reach of every one of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENTLE LOVER.\r\n\r\nA COMEDY OF MIDDLE AGE.\r\n\r\nBy FORREST REID,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF \"THE BRACKNELLS,\" \"FOLLOWING DARKNESS,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo._ =6s.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThis extremely interesting story, of which the title gives a most apt\r\ndescription, is written in a lighter vein than the author's previous\r\nwork. It is a love story, and while the tale itself is enthralling, it\r\ndepends in great measure for its charm on the attractiveness of the\r\ncharacters who figure in the drama and who are all very pleasant\r\ncompany. The book is essentially human, the note is never forced, yet\r\nthe interest goes on increasing right up to the end. It is actual life\r\nwith its comedy and tragedy so closely intermingled that it is not\r\nalways easy to distinguish one from the other. The scene is laid abroad,\r\npartly in Bruges, and partly in Italy, but the characters are, with one\r\nor two exceptions, natives of that part of Ireland with which the author\r\nis most familiar, and they lose none of their individuality by being\r\ntransplanted to those beautiful old-world cities where we follow their\r\nvaried fortunes. Mr. Reid's previous novels have already secured for his\r\nwork the warm appreciation of some of the best judges of literary\r\nvalues, and the present novel may be confidently stated to exhibit his\r\nundoubted power as a writer of fiction in an advanced and progressive\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NEW SCIENTIFIC WORKS_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL POISONING\r\n\r\nFrom Fumes, Gases, and Poisons of Manufacturing Processes.\r\n\r\nBy Dr. J.

The diseases to\r\nwhich the aged are especially liable are fully described, their causes\r\nare clearly indicated, and the author shows in a practical way by what\r\nmeans they may be avoided and how they may be appropriately treated.\r\nSpecial attention is given to such important subjects as diet, exercise,\r\netc. Suggestive dietary tables are given, both for use in health and in\r\nparticular diseases, while the chapters devoted to methods of exercise\r\nmost suitable in advanced age will also prove of value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLONDON: EDWARD ARNOLD, 41 & 43 MADDOX STREET, W.\r\n\r\n\r\n       +----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n       |                                                          |\r\n       |            Transcriber's notes:                          |\r\n       |                                                          |\r\n       | P.ix.
