RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nA REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE STATE OF TENNESSEE\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1897\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefatory Note\r\n\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the authorization of the Joint Committee on Printing,\r\nI have undertaken this compilation.\r\n\r\nThe messages of the several Presidents of the United States--annual,\r\nveto, and special--are among the most interesting, instructive, and\r\nvaluable contributions to the public literature of our Republic. They\r\ndiscuss from the loftiest standpoint nearly all the great questions of\r\nnational policy and many subjects of minor interest which have engaged\r\nthe attention of the people from the beginning of our history, and\r\nso constitute important and often vital links in their progressive\r\ndevelopment. The proclamations, also, contain matter and sentiment no\r\nless elevating, interesting, and important. They inspire to the highest\r\nand most exalted degree the patriotic fervor and love of country in the\r\nhearts of the people.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that legislators and other public men, students of our\r\nnational history, and many others will hail with satisfaction the\r\ncompilation and publication of these messages and proclamations in\r\nsuch compact form as will render them easily accessible and of ready\r\nreference. The work can not fail to be exceedingly convenient and useful\r\nto all who have occasion to consult these documents. The Government has\r\nnever heretofore authorized a like publication.\r\n\r\nIn executing the commission with which I have been charged I have sought\r\nto bring together in the several volumes of the series all Presidential\r\nproclamations, addresses, messages, and communications to Congress\r\nexcepting those nominating persons to office and those which simply\r\ntransmit treaties, and reports of heads of Departments which contain\r\nno recommendation from the Executive. The utmost effort has been made\r\nto render the compilation accurate and exhaustive.\r\n\r\nAlthough not required by the terms of the resolution authorizing the\r\ncompilation, it has been deemed wise and wholly consistent with its\r\npurpose to incorporate in the first volume authentic copies of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the\r\nConstitution of the United States, together with steel engravings of\r\nthe Capitol, the Executive Mansion, and of the historical painting the\r\n\"Signing of the Declaration of Independence.\" Steel portraits of the\r\nPresidents will be inserted each in its appropriate place.\r\n\r\nThe compilation has not been brought even to its present stage without\r\nmuch labor and close application, and the end is far from view; but if\r\nit shall prove satisfactory to Congress and the country, I will feel\r\ncompensated for my time and effort.\r\n\r\nJAMES D. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C.,\r\n\r\n_February 22, 1896_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Independence\r\n\r\nJuly 4, 1776\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Independence\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The words \"Declaration of Independence\" do not appear on\r\nthe original.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776.\r\n\r\nThe unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,\r\n\r\nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people\r\nto dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another,\r\nand to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal\r\nstation to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them,\r\na decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should\r\ndeclare the causes which impel them to the separation.--We hold these\r\ntruths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are\r\nendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among\r\nthese are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure\r\nthese rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just\r\npowers from the consent of the governed,--That whenever any Form of\r\nGovernment becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the\r\nPeople to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government,\r\nlaying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in\r\nsuch form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety\r\nand Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long\r\nestablished should not be changed for light and transient causes; and\r\naccordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed\r\nto suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by\r\nabolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train\r\nof abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a\r\ndesign to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is\r\ntheir duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for\r\ntheir future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these\r\nColonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter\r\ntheir former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of\r\nGreat Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all\r\nhaving in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over\r\nthese States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid\r\nworld.--He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and\r\nnecessary for the public good.--He has forbidden his Governors to pass\r\nLaws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their\r\noperation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he\r\nhas utterly neglected to attend to them.--He has refused to pass other\r\nLaws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those\r\npeople would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature,\r\na right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.--He has\r\ncalled together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable,\r\nand distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole\r\npurpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.--He has\r\ndissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly\r\nfirmness his invasions on the rights of the people.--He has refused for\r\na long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected;\r\nwhereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned\r\nto the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the\r\nmean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and\r\nconvulsions within.--He has endeavoured to prevent the population of\r\nthese States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization\r\nof Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations\r\nhither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.--He\r\nhas obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to\r\nLaws for establishing Judiciary powers.--He has made Judges dependent\r\non his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and\r\npayment of their salaries.--He has erected a multitude of New Offices,\r\nand sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out\r\ntheir substance.--He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing\r\nArmies without the Consent of our legislatures.--He has affected to\r\nrender the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.--He\r\nhas combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our\r\nconstitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their\r\nActs of pretended Legislation:--For quartering large bodies of armed\r\ntroops among us:--For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment\r\nfor any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these\r\nStates:--For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:--For\r\nimposing Taxes on us without our Consent:--For depriving us in many\r\ncases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:--For transporting us beyond\r\nSeas to be tried for pretended offences:--For abolishing the free System\r\nof English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an\r\nArbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render\r\nit at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same\r\nabsolute rule into these Colonies:--For taking away our Charters,\r\nabolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms\r\nof our Governments:--For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring\r\nthemselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases\r\nwhatsoever.--He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of\r\nhis Protection and waging War against us.--He has plundered our seas,\r\nravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the Lives of our\r\npeople.--He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign\r\nMercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny,\r\nalready begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely\r\nparalleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head\r\nof a civilized nation.--He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken\r\nCaptive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become\r\nthe executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by\r\ntheir Hands.--He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has\r\nendeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless\r\nIndian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished\r\ndestruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these\r\nOppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our\r\nrepeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince,\r\nwhose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant,\r\nis unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting\r\nin attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time\r\nto time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable\r\njurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our\r\nemigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice\r\nand magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common\r\nkindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt\r\nour connections and correspondence They too have been deaf to the voice\r\nof justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the\r\nnecessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold\r\nthe rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.--\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of\r\nAmerica, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme\r\nJudge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name,\r\nand by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish\r\nand declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be\r\nFree and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all\r\nAllegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection\r\nbetween them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally\r\ndissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power\r\nto levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and\r\nto do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right\r\ndo.--And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on\r\nthe protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other\r\nour Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\r\n\r\nJOHN HANCOCK\r\n\r\n  JOSIAH BARTLETT\r\n  W'M WHIPPLE\r\n  SAM'L.

The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and\r\nintercourse among the people of the different states in this union,\r\nthe free inhabitants of each of these states, paupers, vagabonds and\r\nfugitives from Justice excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges\r\nand immunities of free citizens in the several states; and the people\r\nof each state shall have free ingress and regress to and from any other\r\nstate, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce,\r\nsubject to the same duties, impositions and restrictions as the\r\ninhabitants thereof respectively, provided that such restriction shall\r\nnot extend so far as to prevent the removal of property imported into\r\nany state, to any other state of which the Owner is an inhabitant;\r\nprovided also that no imposition, duties or restriction shall be laid\r\nby any state, on the property of the united states, or either of them.\r\n\r\nIf any Person guilty of, or charged with treason, felony, or other high\r\nmisdemeanor in any state, shall flee from Justice, and be found in any\r\nof the united states, he shall upon demand of the Governor or executive\r\npower, of the state from which he fled, be delivered up and removed to\r\nthe state having jurisdiction of his offence.\r\n\r\nFull faith and credit shall be given in each of these states to the\r\nrecords, acts and judicial proceedings of the courts and magistrates\r\nof every other state.\r\n\r\nArticle V.

Whenever the legislative or executive authority\r\nor lawful agent of any state in controversy with another shall present\r\na petition to congress, stating the matter in question and praying for\r\na hearing, notice thereof shall be given by order of congress to the\r\nlegislative or executive authority of the other state in controversy,\r\nand a day assigned for the appearance of the parties by their lawful\r\nagents, who shall then be directed to appoint by joint consent,\r\ncommissioners or judges to constitute a court for hearing and\r\ndetermining the matter in question: but if they cannot agree, congress\r\nshall name three persons out of each of the united states, and from the\r\nlist of such persons each party shall alternately strike out one, the\r\npetitioners beginning, until the number shall be reduced to thirteen;\r\nand from that number not less than seven, nor more than nine names as\r\ncongress shall direct, shall in the presence of congress be drawn out by\r\nlot, and the persons whose names shall be so drawn or any five of them,\r\nshall be commissioners or judges, to hear and finally determine the\r\ncontroversy, so always as a major part of the judges who shall hear\r\nthe cause shall agree in the determination: and if either party shall\r\nneglect to attend at the day appointed, without shewing reasons, which\r\ncongress shall judge sufficient, or being present shall refuse to\r\nstrike, the congress shall proceed to nominate three persons out of\r\neach state, and the secretary of congress shall strike in behalf of\r\nsuch party absent or refusing; and the judgment and sentence of the\r\ncourt to be appointed, in the manner before prescribed, shall be final\r\nand conclusive; and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit to the\r\nauthority of such court, or to appear or defend their claim or cause,\r\nthe court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence, or judgment,\r\nwhich shall in like manner be final and decisive, the judgment or\r\nsentence and other proceedings being in either case transmitted to\r\ncongress, and lodged among the acts of congress for the security of the\r\nparties concerned: provided that every commissioner, before he sits in\r\njudgment, shall take an oath to be administred by one of the judges of\r\nthe supreme or superior court of the state, where the cause shall be\r\ntried, \"well and truly to hear and determine the matter in question,\r\naccording to the best of his judgment, without favour, affection or hope\r\nof reward:\" provided also that no state shall be deprived of territory\r\nfor the benefit of the united states.\r\n\r\nAll controversies concerning the private right of soil claimed under\r\ndifferent grants of two or more states, whose jurisdictions as they\r\nmay respect such lands, and the states which passed such grants are\r\nadjusted, the said grants or either of them being at the same time\r\nclaimed to have originated antecedent to such settlement of\r\njurisdiction, shall on the petition of either party to the congress\r\nof the united states, be finally determined as near as may be in the\r\nsame manner as is before prescribed for deciding disputes respecting\r\nterritorial jurisdiction between different states.\r\n\r\nThe united states in congress assembled shall also have the sole\r\nand exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of\r\ncoin struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective\r\nstates--fixing the standard of weights and measures throughout the\r\nunited states.--regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the\r\nIndians, not members of any of the states, provided that the legislative\r\nright of any state within its own limits be not infringed or\r\nviolated--establishing and regulating post-offices from one state to\r\nanother, throughout all the united states, and exacting such postage\r\non the papers passing thro' the same as may be requisite to defray\r\nthe expences of the said office--appointing all officers of the land\r\nforces, in the service of the united states, excepting regimental\r\nofficers.--appointing all the officers of the naval forces, and\r\ncommissioning all officers whatever in the service of the united\r\nstates--making rules for the government and regulation of the said\r\nland and naval forces, and directing their operations.\r\n\r\nThe united states in congress assembled shall have authority to appoint\r\na committee, to sit in the recess of congress, to be denominated\r\n\"A Committee of the States,\" and to consist of one delegate from each\r\nstate; and to appoint such other committees and civil officers as may be\r\nnecessary for managing the general affairs of the united states under\r\ntheir direction--to appoint one of their number to preside, provided\r\nthat no person be allowed to serve in the office of president more than\r\none year in any term of three years;

Augustine Washington, his father, was a son of Lawrence\r\nWashington, whose father, John Washington, came to Virginia from England\r\nin 1657, and settled at Bridges Creek. Augustine Washington died in\r\n1743, leaving several children, George being the eldest by his second\r\nwife, Mary Ball. At the early age of 19 years he was appointed\r\nadjutant-general of one of the districts of Virginia, with the rank of\r\nmajor. In November, 1753, he was sent by Lieutenant-Governor Dinwiddie,\r\nof Virginia, to visit the French army in the Ohio Valley on important\r\nbusiness. War followed, and in 1754 he was promoted to the rank of\r\nlieutenant-colonel, and engaged in the war. In 1755 he acted as\r\naid-de-camp to General Braddock. Soon after this he was appointed by the\r\nlegislature commander in chief of all the forces of the Colony, and for\r\nthree years devoted himself to recruiting and organizing troops for her\r\ndefense. In 1758 he commanded a successful expedition to Fort Du Quesne.\r\nHe then left the Army, and was married to Mrs. Martha Custis, a widow\r\nlady of Virginia. For sixteen years he resided at Mount Vernon,\r\noccasionally acting as a magistrate or as a member of the legislature.\r\nHe was a delegate to the Williamsburg convention, August, 1773, which\r\nresolved that taxation and representation were inseparable. In 1774\r\nhe was sent to the Continental Congress as a delegate from Virginia.\r\nThe following year he was unanimously chosen commander in chief, and\r\nassumed the command of the Continental Army July 2, 1775. He commanded\r\nthe armies throughout the War for Independence. At the close he resigned\r\nhis commission, December 23, 1783, and retired to private life. He was\r\na delegate to, and president of, the National Convention which met\r\nin Philadelphia, Pa., in May, 1787, and adopted a new Constitution,\r\nthat greatly increased the power of the Federal Government. He was\r\nunanimously elected the first President of the United States, and was\r\ninaugurated on the 30th of April, 1789, in New York City, and at the\r\nend of his first term was unanimously reelected. He retired March 4,\r\n1797, having declined a third term. In September, 1796, he issued his\r\nFarewell Address to the people. July 3, 1798, he was again appointed\r\nto the command of the armies of the United States, with the rank of\r\nlieutenant-general. He was a Freemason, and served as master of his\r\nlodge. He died at Mount Vernon, Va., after a short illness, December\r\n14, 1799, and was buried there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS INITIATORY TO THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Washington Papers (Executive Proceedings, vol. 17), Department\r\nof State.]\r\n\r\nCharles Thomson, esq., Secretary of the late Congress, being appointed\r\nby the Senate of the United States to carry to General Washington the\r\nofficial information of his unanimous election to the office of\r\nPresident of the United States of America, arrived at Mount Vernon on\r\nthe 14th day of April, A.D. 1789, when he communicated to General\r\nWashington the purport of his mission in the following words:\r\n\r\nSir: The President of the Senate chosen for the special purpose, having\r\nopened and counted the votes of the electors in presence of the Senate\r\nand House of Representatives, I was honored with the commands of the\r\nSenate to wait upon Your Excellency with the information of your being\r\nelected to the office of President of the United States of America. This\r\ncommission was intrusted to me on account of my having been long in the\r\nconfidence of the late Congress, and charged with the duties of one of\r\nthe principal civil departments of Government.\r\n\r\nI have now, sir, to inform you that the proofs you have given of your\r\npatriotism, and of your readiness to sacrifice domestic ease and private\r\nenjoyments to preserve the happiness of your country, did not permit the\r\ntwo Houses to harbor a doubt of your undertaking this great and\r\nimportant office, to which you are called, not only by the unanimous\r\nvote of the electors, but by the voice of America.\r\n\r\nI have it, therefore, in command to accompany you to New York, where the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives are convened for the dispatch of\r\npublic business.\r\n\r\nTo which General Washington replied:\r\n\r\nSIR: I have been accustomed to pay so much respect to the opinion of my\r\nfellow-citizens that the knowledge of their having given their unanimous\r\nsuffrages in my favor scarcely leaves me the alternative for an option.\r\nI can not, I believe, give a greater evidence of my sensibility of the\r\nhonor which they have done me than by accepting the appointment.\r\n\r\nI am so much affected by this fresh proof of my country's esteem and\r\nconfidence that silence can best explain my gratitude. While I realize\r\nthe arduous nature of the task which is imposed upon me, and feel my own\r\ninability to perform it, I wish, however, that there may not be reason\r\nfor regretting the choice, for, indeed, all I can promise is only to\r\naccomplish that which can be done by an honest zeal.\r\n\r\nUpon considering how long time some of the gentlemen of both Houses\r\nof Congress have been at New York, how anxiously desirous they must be\r\nto proceed to business, and how deeply the public mind appears to be\r\nimpressed with the necessity of doing it speedily, I can not find myself\r\nat liberty to delay my journey. I shall therefore be in readiness to set\r\nout the day after to-morrow, and shall be happy in the pleasure of your\r\ncompany, for you will permit me to say that it is a peculiar\r\ngratification to have received the communication from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL INFORMATION OF THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES, APRIL 6, 1789.\r\n\r\nBe it known that the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America, being convened in the city and State of New York,\r\nthis 6th day of April, A.D. 1789, the underwritten, appointed President\r\nof the Senate for the sole purpose of receiving, opening, and counting\r\nthe votes of the electors, did, in the presence of the said Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives, open all the certificates and count all the\r\nvotes of the electors for a President and Vice-President, by which it\r\nappears that His Excellency George Washington, esq., was unanimously\r\nelected, agreeably to the Constitution, to the office of President of\r\nthe said United States of America.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal.\r\n\r\nJOHN LANGDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNT VERNON, _April 14, 1789_.\r\n\r\nTo the Honorable JOHN LANGDON,\r\n\r\n_President pro tempore of the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I had the honor to receive your official communication, by the hand\r\nof Mr. Secretary Thomson, about 1 o'clock this day.

On the one hand, I was summoned by my country, whose voice I can\r\nnever hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had\r\nchosen with the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with\r\nan immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years--a retreat\r\nwhich was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me\r\nby the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions\r\nin my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time. On the other\r\nhand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of\r\nmy country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and\r\nmost experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his\r\nqualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who\r\n(inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the\r\nduties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of\r\nhis own deficiencies. In this conflict of emotions all I dare aver\r\nis that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just\r\nappreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected. All\r\nI dare hope is that if, in executing this task, I have been too much\r\nswayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an\r\naffectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of\r\nmy fellow-citizens, and have thence too little consulted my incapacity\r\nas well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me,\r\nmy error will be palliated by the motives which mislead me, and its\r\nconsequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality\r\nin which they originated.\r\n\r\nSuch being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the\r\npublic summons, repaired to the present station, it would be peculiarly\r\nimproper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to\r\nthat Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the\r\ncouncils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human\r\ndefect, that His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and\r\nhappiness of the people of the United States a Government instituted by\r\nthemselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument\r\nemployed in its administration to execute with success the functions\r\nallotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of\r\nevery public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your\r\nsentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow-citizens at\r\nlarge less than either. No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore\r\nthe Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those\r\nof the United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the\r\ncharacter of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by\r\nsome token of providential agency; and in the important revolution just\r\naccomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil\r\ndeliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from\r\nwhich the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which\r\nmost governments have been established without some return of pious\r\ngratitude, along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings\r\nwhich the past seem to presage. These reflections, arising out of the\r\npresent crisis, have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be\r\nsuppressed. You will join with me, I trust, in thinking that there are\r\nnone under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free\r\ngovernment can more auspiciously commence.\r\n\r\nBy the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty\r\nof the President \"to recommend to your consideration such measures as\r\nhe shall judge necessary and expedient.\" The circumstances under which\r\nI now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject further\r\nthan to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are\r\nassembled, and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects\r\nto which your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent with\r\nthose circumstances, and far more congenial with the feelings which\r\nactuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation of particular\r\nmeasures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the\r\npatriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them.\r\nIn these honorable qualifications I behold the surest pledges that as on\r\none side no local prejudices or attachments, no separate views nor party\r\nanimosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought\r\nto watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests, so, on\r\nanother, that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the\r\npure and immutable principles of private morality, and the preeminence\r\nof free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win\r\nthe affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world.\r\nI dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love\r\nfor my country can inspire, since there is no truth more thoroughly\r\nestablished than that there exists in the economy and course of nature\r\nan indissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty and\r\nadvantage; between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous\r\npolicy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity; since we\r\nought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven can\r\nnever be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order\r\nand right which Heaven itself has ordained; and since the preservation\r\nof the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model\r\nof government are justly considered, perhaps, as _deeply_, as\r\n_finally_, staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with\r\nyour judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power\r\ndelegated by the fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient\r\nat the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been\r\nurged against the system, or by the degree of inquietude which has given\r\nbirth to them. Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this\r\nsubject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official\r\nopportunities, I shall again give way to my entire confidence in your\r\ndiscernment and pursuit of the public good; for I assure myself that\r\nwhilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the\r\nbenefits of an united and effective government, or which ought to await\r\nthe future lessons of experience, a reverence for the characteristic\r\nrights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently\r\ninfluence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be\r\nimpregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously\r\npromoted.\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing observations I have one to add, which will be most\r\nproperly addressed to the House of Representatives. It concerns myself,\r\nand will therefore be as brief as possible. When I was first honored\r\nwith a call into the service of my country, then on the eve of an\r\narduous struggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my\r\nduty required that I should renounce every pecuniary compensation. From\r\nthis resolution I have in no instance departed; and being still under\r\nthe impressions which produced it, I must decline as inapplicable to\r\nmyself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably\r\nincluded in a permanent provision for the executive department, and must\r\naccordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which\r\nI am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual\r\nexpenditures as the public good may be thought to require.\r\n\r\nHaving thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by\r\nthe occasion which brings us together, I shall take my present leave;\r\nbut not without resorting once more to the benign Parent of the Human\r\nRace in humble supplication that, since He has been pleased to favor\r\nthe American people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect\r\ntranquillity, and dispositions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity\r\non a form of government for the security of their union and the\r\nadvancement of their happiness, so His divine blessing may be equally\r\n_conspicuous_ in the enlarged views, the temperate consultations, and\r\nthe wise measures on which the success of this Government must depend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: We, the Senate of the United States, return you our sincere\r\nthanks for your excellent speech delivered to both Houses of Congress,\r\ncongratulate you on the complete organization of the Federal Government,\r\nand felicitate ourselves and our fellow-citizens on your elevation\r\nto the office of President, an office highly important by the powers\r\nconstitutionally annexed to it and extremely honorable from the manner\r\nin which the appointment is made. The unanimous suffrage of the\r\nelective body in your favor is peculiarly expressive of the gratitude,\r\nconfidence, and affection of the citizens of America, and is the highest\r\ntestimonial at once of your merit and their esteem. We are sensible,\r\nsir, that nothing but the voice of your fellow-citizens could have\r\ncalled you from a retreat chosen with the fondest predilection, endeared\r\nby habit, and consecrated to the repose of declining years. We rejoice,\r\nand with us all America, that in obedience to the call of our common\r\ncountry you have returned once more to public life. In you all parties\r\nconfide; in you all interests unite; and we have no doubt that your\r\npast services, great as they have been, will be equaled by your future\r\nexertions, and that your prudence and sagacity as a statesman will tend\r\nto avert the dangers to which we were exposed, to give stability to the\r\npresent Government and dignity and splendor to that country which your\r\nskill and valor as a soldier so eminently contributed to raise to\r\nindependence and empire.\r\n\r\nWhen we contemplate the coincidence of circumstances and wonderful\r\ncombination of causes which gradually prepared the people of this\r\ncountry for independence; when we contemplate the rise, progress, and\r\ntermination of the late war, which gave them a name among the nations of\r\nthe earth, we are with you unavoidably led to acknowledge and adore the\r\nGreat Arbiter of the Universe, by whom empires rise and fall. A review\r\nof the many signal instances of divine interposition in favor of this\r\ncountry claims our most pious gratitude; and permit us, sir, to observe\r\nthat among the great events which have led to the formation and\r\nestablishment of a Federal Government we esteem your acceptance of\r\nthe office of President as one of the most propitious and important.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of the trust reposed in us we shall endeavor to pursue\r\nthat enlarged and liberal policy to which your speech so happily\r\ndirects. We are conscious that the prosperity of each State is\r\ninseparably connected with the welfare of all, and that in promoting\r\nthe latter we shall effectually advance the former. In full persuasion\r\nof this truth, it shall be our invariable aim to divest ourselves of\r\nlocal prejudices and attachments, and to view the great assemblage of\r\ncommunities and interests committed to our charge with an equal eye.\r\nWe feel, sir, the force and acknowledge the justness of the observation\r\nthat the foundation of our national policy should be laid in private\r\nmorality. If individuals be not influenced by moral principles, it is in\r\nvain to look for public virtue. It is therefore the duty of legislators\r\nto enforce, both by precept and example, the utility as well as the\r\nnecessity of a strict adherence to the rules of distributive justice.\r\nWe beg you to be assured that the Senate will at all times cheerfully\r\ncooperate in every measure which may strengthen the Union, conduce\r\nto the happiness or secure and perpetuate the liberties of this great\r\nconfederated Republic.\r\n\r\nWe commend you, sir, to the protection of Almighty God, earnestly\r\nbeseeching Him long to preserve a life so valuable and dear to the\r\npeople of the United States, and that your Administration may be\r\nprosperous to the nation and glorious to yourself.\r\n\r\nMAY 7, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I thank you for your address, in which the most affectionate\r\nsentiments are expressed in the most obliging terms. The coincidence\r\nof circumstances which led to this auspicious crisis, the confidence\r\nreposed in me by my fellow-citizens, and the assistance I may expect\r\nfrom counsels which will be dictated by an enlarged and liberal policy\r\nseem to presage a more prosperous issue to my Administration than a\r\ndiffidence of my abilities had taught me to anticipate. I now feel\r\nmyself inexpressibly happy in a belief that Heaven, which has done so\r\nmuch for our infant nation, will not withdraw its providential influence\r\nbefore our political felicity shall have been completed, and in a\r\nconviction that the Senate will at all times cooperate in every measure\r\nwhich may tend to promote the welfare of this confederated Republic.\r\nThus supported by a firm trust in the Great Arbiter of the Universe,\r\naided by the collected wisdom of the Union, and imploring the divine\r\nbenediction on our joint exertions in the service of our country, I\r\nreadily engage with you in the arduous but pleasing task of attempting\r\nto make a nation happy.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nMAY 18, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The Representatives of the people of the United States present\r\ntheir congratulations on the event by which your fellow-citizens have\r\nattested the preeminence of your merit. You have long held the first\r\nplace in their esteem. You have often received tokens of their\r\naffection. You now possess the only proof that remained of their\r\ngratitude for your services, of their reverence for your wisdom, and\r\nof their confidence in your virtues. You enjoy the highest, because\r\nthe truest, honor of being the first Magistrate by the unanimous choice\r\nof the freest people on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nWe well know the anxieties with which you must have obeyed a summons\r\nfrom the repose reserved for your declining years into public scenes, of\r\nwhich you had taken your leave forever. But the obedience was due to the\r\noccasion. It is already applauded by the universal joy which welcomes\r\nyou to your station. And we can not doubt that it will be rewarded with\r\nall the satisfaction with which an ardent love for your fellow-citizens\r\nmust review successful efforts to promote their happiness.\r\n\r\nThis anticipation is not justified merely by the past experience\r\nof your signal services. It is particularly suggested by the pious\r\nimpressions under which you commence your Administration and the\r\nenlightened maxims by which you mean to conduct it. We feel with you\r\nthe strongest obligations to adore the Invisible Hand which has led the\r\nAmerican people through so many difficulties, to cherish a conscious\r\nresponsibility for the destiny of republican liberty, and to seek the\r\nonly sure means of preserving and recommending the precious deposit in a\r\nsystem of legislation founded on the principles of an honest policy and\r\ndirected by the spirit of a diffusive patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe question arising out of the fifth article of the Constitution will\r\nreceive all the attention demanded by its importance, and will, we\r\ntrust, be decided under the influence of all the considerations to which\r\nyou allude.\r\n\r\nIn forming the pecuniary provisions for the executive department we\r\nshall not lose sight of a wish resulting from motives which give it a\r\npeculiar claim to our regard. Your resolution, in a moment critical to\r\nthe liberties of your country, to renounce all personal emolument, was\r\namong the many presages of your patriotic services which have been amply\r\nfulfilled; and your scrupulous adherence now to the law then imposed on\r\nyourself can not fail to demonstrate the purity, whilst it increases the\r\nluster, of a character which has so many titles to admiration.\r\n\r\nSuch are the sentiments which we have thought fit to address to you.\r\nThey flow from our own hearts, and we verily believe that among the\r\nmillions we represent there is not a virtuous citizen whose heart will\r\ndisown them.\r\n\r\nAll that remains is that we join in our fervent supplications for the\r\nblessings of Heaven on our country, and that we add our own for the\r\nchoicest of these blessings on the most beloved of her citizens.\r\n\r\nMAY 5, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: Your very affectionate address produces emotions which I know\r\nnot how to express. I feel that my past endeavors in the service of my\r\ncountry are far overpaid by its goodness, and I fear much that my future\r\nones may not fulfill your kind anticipation. All that I can promise is\r\nthat they will be invariably directed by an honest and an ardent zeal.\r\nOf this resource my heart assures me. For all beyond I rely on the\r\nwisdom and patriotism of those with whom I am to cooperate and a\r\ncontinuance of the blessings of Heaven on our beloved country.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nMAY 8, 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _May 25, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the order of the late Congress, treaties between the\r\nUnited States and several nations of Indians have been negotiated and\r\nsigned. These treaties, with sundry papers respecting them, I now lay\r\nbefore you, for your consideration and advice, by the hands of General\r\nKnox, under whose official superintendence the business was transacted,\r\nand who will be ready to communicate to you any information on such\r\npoints as may appear to require it,\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _June 11, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nA convention between His Most Christian Majesty and the United\r\nStates, for the purposes of determining and fixing the functions and\r\nprerogatives of their respective consuls, vice-consuls, agents, and\r\ncommissaries, was signed by their respective plenipotentiaries on the\r\n29th of July, 1784.\r\n\r\nIt appearing to the late Congress that certain alterations in that\r\nconvention ought to be made, they instructed their minister at the Court\r\nof France to endeavor to obtain them.\r\n\r\nIt has accordingly been altered in several respects, and as amended was\r\nsigned by the plenipotentiaries of the contracting powers on the 14th of\r\nNovember, 1788.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth article provides that it shall be in force during the term\r\nof twelve years, to be counted from the day of the exchange _of\r\nratifications, which shall be given in proper form_, and exchanged on\r\nboth sides within the space of one year, or sooner if possible.\r\n\r\nI now lay before you the original by the hands of Mr. Jay for your\r\nconsideration and advice. The papers relative to this negotiation are\r\nin his custody, and he has my orders to communicate to you whatever\r\nofficial papers and information on the subject he may possess and you\r\nmay require.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _June 15, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson, the present minister of the United States at the Court of\r\nFrance, having applied for permission to return home for a few months,\r\nand it appearing to me proper to comply with his request, it becomes\r\nnecessary that some person be appointed _to take charge_ of our affairs\r\nat that Court during his absence.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose I nominate William Short, esq., and request your advice\r\non the propriety of appointing him.\r\n\r\nThere are in the Office for Foreign Affairs papers which will acquaint\r\nyou with his character, and which Mr. Jay has my directions to lay\r\nbefore you at such time as you may think proper to assign.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _August 6, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nMy nomination of Benjamin Fishbourn for the place of naval officer\r\nof the port of Savannah not having met with your concurrence, I now\r\nnominate Lachlan McIntosh for that office.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the reasons which induced your dissent, I am\r\npersuaded they were such as you deemed sufficient. Permit me to submit\r\nto your consideration whether on occasions where the propriety of\r\nnominations appear questionable to you it would not be expedient to\r\ncommunicate that circumstance to me, and thereby avail yourselves of the\r\ninformation which led me to make them, and which I would with pleasure\r\nlay before you. Probably my reasons for nominating Mr. Fishbourn may\r\ntend to show that such a mode of proceeding in such cases might be\r\nuseful. I will therefore detail them.\r\n\r\nFirst. While Colonel Fishbourn was an officer in actual service and\r\nchiefly under my own eye, his conduct appeared to me irreproachable; nor\r\ndid I ever hear anything injurious to his reputation as an officer or a\r\ngentleman. At the storm of Stony Point his behavior was represented to\r\nhave been active and brave, and he was charged by his general to bring\r\nthe account of that success to the headquarters of the Army.\r\n\r\nSecondly. Since his residence in Georgia he has been repeatedly elected\r\nto the assembly as a representative of the county of Chatham, in which\r\nthe port of Savannah is situated, and sometimes of the counties of Glynn\r\nand Camden; he has been chosen a member of the executive council of the\r\nState and has lately been president of the same; he has been elected by\r\nthe officers of the militia in the county of Chatham lieutenant-colonel\r\nof the militia in that district, and on a very recent occasion, to wit,\r\nin the month of May last, he has been appointed by the council (on the\r\nsuspension of the late collector) to an office in the port of Savannah\r\nnearly similar to that for which I nominated him, which office he\r\nactually holds at this time. To these reasons for nominating Mr.\r\nFishbourn I might add that I received private letters of recommendation\r\nand oral testimonials in his favor from some of the most respectable\r\ncharacters in that State; but as they were secondary considerations\r\nwith me, I do not think it necessary to communicate them to you.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, therefore, to me that Mr. Fishbourn must have enjoyed the\r\n_confidence_ of the militia officers in order to have been elected to a\r\nmilitary rank; the _confidence_ of the freemen to have been elected to\r\nthe assembly; the _confidence_ of the assembly to have been selected for\r\nthe council, and the _confidence_ of the council to have been appointed\r\ncollector of the port of Savannah.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _August 7, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe business which has hitherto been under the consideration of Congress\r\nhas been of so much importance that I was unwilling to draw their\r\nattention from it to any other subject; but the disputes which exist\r\nbetween some of the United States and several powerful tribes of Indians\r\nwithin the limits of the Union, and the hostilities which have in\r\nseveral instances been committed on the frontiers, seem to require the\r\nimmediate interposition of the General Government.\r\n\r\nI have therefore directed the several statements and papers which have\r\nbeen submitted to me on this subject by General Knox to be laid before\r\nyou for your information.\r\n\r\nWhile the measures of Government ought to be calculated to protect its\r\ncitizens from all injury and violence, a due regard should be extended\r\nto those Indian tribes whose happiness in the course of events so\r\nmaterially depends on the national justice and humanity of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIf it should be the judgment of Congress that it would be most\r\nexpedient to terminate all differences in the Southern district, and\r\nto lay the foundation for future confidence by an amicable treaty\r\nwith the Indian tribes in that quarter, I think proper to suggest the\r\nconsideration of the expediency of instituting a temporary commission\r\nfor that purpose, to consist of three persons, whose authority should\r\nexpire with the occasion. How far such a measure, unassisted by posts,\r\nwould be competent to the establishment and preservation of peace and\r\ntranquillity on the frontiers is also a matter which merits your serious\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nAlong with this object I am induced to suggest another, with the\r\nnational importance and necessity of which I am deeply impressed;\r\nI mean some uniform and effective system for the militia of the United\r\nStates. It is unnecessary to offer arguments in recommendation of a\r\nmeasure on which the honor, safety, and well-being of our country so\r\nevidently and so essentially depend; but it may not be amiss to observe\r\nthat I am particularly anxious it should receive as early attention\r\nas circumstances will admit, because it is now in our power to avail\r\nourselves of the military knowledge disseminated throughout the several\r\nStates by means of the many well-instructed officers and soldiers of\r\nthe late Army, a resource which is daily diminishing by death and other\r\ncauses. To suffer this peculiar advantage to pass away unimproved would\r\nbe to neglect an opportunity which will never again occur, unless,\r\nunfortunately, we should again be involved in a long and arduous war.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _August 10, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI have directed a statement of the troops in the service of the United\r\nStates to be laid before you for your information.\r\n\r\nThese troops were raised by virtue of the resolves of Congress of the\r\n20th October, 1786, and the 3d of October, 1787, in order to protect the\r\nfrontiers from the depredations of the hostile Indians, to prevent all\r\nintrusions on the public lands, and to facilitate the surveying and\r\nselling of the same for the purpose of reducing the public debt.\r\n\r\nAs these important objects continue to require the aid of the troops, it\r\nis necessary that the establishment thereof should in all respects be\r\nconformed by law to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _August 20, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_\r\n\r\nIn consequence of an act providing for the expenses which may attend\r\nnegotiations or treaties with the Indian tribes and the appointment of\r\ncommissioners for managing the same, I nominate Benjamin Lincoln as one\r\nof three commissioners whom I shall propose to be employed to negotiate\r\na treaty with the Southern Indians. My reason for nominating him at this\r\nearly moment is that it will not be possible for the public to avail\r\nitself of his services on this occasion unless his appointment can be\r\nforwarded to him by the mail which will leave this place to-morrow\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _August 21, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States will meet the Senate in the Senate\r\nChamber at half past 11 o'clock to-morrow, to advise with them on the\r\nterms of the treaty to be negotiated with the Southern Indians.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 16, 1789.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe governor of the Western territory has made a statement to me of the\r\nreciprocal hostilities of the Wabash Indians and the people inhabiting\r\nthe frontiers bordering on the river Ohio, which I herewith lay before\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe United States in Congress assembled, by their acts of the 21st\r\nday of July, 1787, and of the 12th August, 1788, made a provisional\r\narrangement for calling forth the militia of Virginia and Pennsylvania\r\nin the proportions therein specified.\r\n\r\nAs the circumstances which occasioned the said arrangement continue\r\nnearly the same, I think proper to suggest to your consideration the\r\nexpediency of making some temporary provision for calling forth\r\nthe militia of the United States for the purposes stated in the\r\nConstitution, which would embrace the cases apprehended by the\r\ngovernor of the Western territory.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 17, 1789.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIt doubtless is important that all treaties and compacts formed by the\r\nUnited States with other nations, whether civilized or not, should be\r\nmade with caution and executed with fidelity.\r\n\r\nIt is said to be the general understanding and practice of nations, as a\r\ncheck on the mistakes and indiscretions of ministers or commissioners,\r\nnot to consider any treaty negotiated and signed by such officers as\r\nfinal and conclusive until ratified by the sovereign or government from\r\nwhom they derive their powers. This practice has been adopted by the\r\nUnited States respecting their treaties with European nations, and I am\r\ninclined to think it would be advisable to observe it in the conduct of\r\nour treaties with the Indians; for though such treaties, being on their\r\npart made by their chiefs or rulers, need not be ratified by them, yet,\r\nbeing formed on our part by the agency of subordinate officers, it seems\r\nto be both prudent and reasonable that their acts should not be binding\r\non the nation until approved and ratified by the Government. It strikes\r\nme that this point should be well considered and settled, so that our\r\nnational proceedings in this respect may become uniform and be directed\r\nby fixed and stable principles.\r\n\r\nThe treaties with certain Indian nations, which were laid before you\r\nwith my message of the 25th May last, suggested two questions to my\r\nmind, viz: First, whether those treaties were to be considered as\r\nperfected and consequently as obligatory without being ratified. If not,\r\nthen secondly, whether both or either, and which, of them ought to be\r\nratified. On these questions I request your opinion and advice.\r\n\r\nYou have, indeed, advised me \"_to execute and enjoin an observance of_\"\r\nthe treaty with the Wyandottes, etc. You, gentlemen, doubtless intended\r\nto be clear and explicit, and yet, without further explanation, I fear\r\nI may misunderstand your meaning, for if by my _executing_ that treaty\r\nyou mean that I should make it (in a more particular and immediate manner\r\nthan it now is) the act of Government, then it follows that I am to\r\nratify it. If you mean by my _executing it_ that I am to see that it be\r\ncarried into effect and operation, then I am led to conclude either that\r\nyou consider it as being perfect and obligatory in its present state,\r\nand therefore to be executed and observed, or that you consider it as\r\nto derive its completion and obligation from the silent approbation and\r\nratification which my proclamation may be construed to imply. Although I\r\nam inclined to think that the latter is your intention, yet it certainly\r\nis best that all doubts respecting it be removed.\r\n\r\nPermit me to observe that it will be proper for me to be informed of\r\nyour sentiments relative to the treaty with the Six Nations previous to\r\nthe departure of the governor of the Western territory, and therefore\r\nI recommend it to your early consideration.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _September 29, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate:_\r\n\r\nHis Most Christian Majesty, by a letter dated the 7th of June last,\r\naddressed to the President and members of the General Congress of the\r\nUnited States of North America, announces the much lamented death of his\r\nson, the Dauphin. The generous conduct of the French monarch and nation\r\ntoward this country renders every event that may affect his or their\r\nprosperity interesting to us, and I shall take care to assure him of the\r\nsensibility with which the United States participate in the affliction\r\nwhich a loss so much to be regretted must have occasioned both to him\r\nand to them.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _September 29, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate:_\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the act of Congress for adapting the establishment of the\r\ntroops in public service to the Constitution of the United States,\r\nI nominate the persons specified in the inclosed list to be the\r\ncommissioned officers thereof.\r\n\r\nThis nomination differs from the existing arrangement only in the\r\nfollowing cases, to wit: Lieutenant Erkuries Beatty, promoted to a\r\nvacant captaincy in the infantry; Ensign Edward Spear, promoted to a\r\nvacant lieutenancy of artillery; Jacob Melcher, who has been serving as\r\na volunteer, to be an ensign, vice Benjamin Lawrence, who was appointed\r\nnearly three years past and has never been mustered or joined the\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the order in which the captains and subalterns\r\nare named is not to affect their relative rank, which has been hitherto\r\nbut imperfectly settled owing to the perplexity of promotions in the\r\nState quotas conformably to the late Confederation.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _September 29, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nHaving been yesterday informed by a joint committee of both Houses of\r\nCongress that they had agreed to a recess to commence this day and to\r\ncontinue until the first Monday of January next, I take the earliest\r\nopportunity of acquainting you that, considering how long and laborious\r\nthis session has been and the reasons which I presume have produced this\r\nresolution, it does not appear to me expedient to recommend any measures\r\nto their consideration at present, or now to call your attention,\r\ngentlemen, to any of those matters in my department which require your\r\nadvice and consent and yet remain to be dispatched.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _September 29, 1789_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nHaving been yesterday informed by a joint committee of both Houses of\r\nCongress that they had agreed to a recess to commence this day and to\r\ncontinue until the first Monday of January next, I take the earliest\r\nopportunity of acquainting you that, considering how long and laborious\r\nthis session has been and the reasons which I presume have produced this\r\nresolution, it does not appear to me expedient to recommend any measures\r\nto their consideration at present.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NATIONAL THANKSGIVING.\r\n\r\n[From Sparks's Washington, Vol. XII, p. 119.]\r\n\r\nWhereas it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of\r\nAlmighty God, to obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and\r\nhumbly to implore His protection and favor; and\r\n\r\nWhereas both Houses of Congress have, by their joint committee,\r\nrequested me \"to recommend to the people of the United States a day of\r\npublic thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging with\r\ngrateful hearts the many and signal favors of Almighty God, especially\r\nby affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of\r\ngovernment for their safety and happiness:\"\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I do recommend and assign Thursday, the 26th day of\r\nNovember next, to be devoted by the people of these States to the\r\nservice of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of\r\nall the good that was, that is, or that will be; that we may then all\r\nunite in rendering unto Him our sincere and humble thanks for His kind\r\ncare and protection of the people of this country previous to their\r\nbecoming a nation; for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable\r\ninterpositions of His providence in the course and conclusion of the\r\nlate war; for the great degree of tranquillity, union, and plenty which\r\nwe have since enjoyed; for the peaceable and rational manner in which\r\nwe have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our\r\nsafety and happiness, and particularly the national one now lately\r\ninstituted; for the civil and religious liberty with which we are\r\nblessed, and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful\r\nknowledge; and, in general, for all the great and various favors\r\nwhich He has been pleased to confer upon us.\r\n\r\nAnd also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and\r\nsupplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations, and beseech Him to\r\npardon our national and other trangressions; to enable us all, whether\r\nin public or private stations, to perform our several and relative\r\nduties properly and punctually; to render our National Government a\r\nblessing to all the people by constantly being a Government of wise,\r\njust, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and\r\nobeyed; to protect and guide all sovereigns and nations (especially such\r\nas have shown kindness to us), and to bless them with good governments,\r\npeace, and concord; to promote the knowledge and practice of true\r\nreligion and virtue, and the increase of science among them and us;\r\nand, generally, to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal\r\nprosperity as He alone knows to be best.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of New York, the 3d day of October,\r\nA.D. 1789.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 8, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI embrace with great satisfaction the opportunity which now presents\r\nitself of congratulating you on the present favorable prospects of our\r\npublic affairs. The recent accession of the important State of North\r\nCarolina to the Constitution of the United States (of which official\r\ninformation has been received), the rising credit and respectability of\r\nour country, the general and increasing good will toward the Government\r\nof the Union, and the concord, peace, and plenty with which we are\r\nblessed are circumstances auspicious in an eminent degree to our\r\nnational prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn resuming your consultations for the general good you can not but\r\nderive encouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last\r\nsession have been as satisfactory to your constituents as the novelty\r\nand difficulty of the work allowed you to hope. Still further to realize\r\ntheir expectations and to secure the blessings which a gracious\r\nProvidence has placed within our reach will in the course of the present\r\nimportant session call for the cool and, deliberate exertion of your\r\npatriotism, firmness, and wisdom.\r\n\r\nAmong the many interesting objects which will engage your attention that\r\nof providing for the common defense will merit particular regard. To be\r\nprepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.\r\n\r\nA free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end\r\na uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and\r\ninterest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to\r\nrender them independent of others for essential, particularly military,\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThe proper establishment of the troops which may be deemed indispensable\r\nwill be entitled to mature consideration. In the arrangements which may\r\nbe made respecting it it will be of importance to conciliate the\r\ncomfortable support of the officers and soldiers with a due regard to\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThere was reason to hope that the pacific measures adopted with regard\r\nto certain hostile tribes of Indians would have relieved the inhabitants\r\nof our Southern and Western frontiers from their depredations, but you\r\nwill perceive from the information contained in the papers which I shall\r\ndirect to be laid before you (comprehending a communication from the\r\nCommonwealth of Virginia) that we ought to be prepared to afford\r\nprotection to those parts of the Union, and, if necessary, to punish\r\naggressors.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the United States require that our intercourse with\r\nother nations should be facilitated by such provisions as will enable\r\nme to fulfill my duty in that respect in the manner which circumstances\r\nmay render most conducive to the public good, and to this end that the\r\ncompensations to be made to the persons who may be employed should,\r\naccording to the nature of their appointments, be defined by law, and\r\na competent fund designated for defraying the expenses incident to the\r\nconduct of our foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nVarious considerations also render it expedient that the terms on which\r\nforeigners may be admitted to the rights of citizens should be speedily\r\nascertained by a uniform rule of naturalization.\r\n\r\nUniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States\r\nis an object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly\r\nattended to.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures by all proper\r\nmeans will not, I trust, need recommendation; but I can not forbear\r\nintimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as\r\nwell to the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad as\r\nto the exertions of skill and genius in producing them at home, and of\r\nfacilitating the intercourse between the distant parts of our country\r\nby a due attention to the post-office and post-roads.\r\n\r\nNor am I less persuaded that you will agree with me in opinion that\r\nthere is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the\r\npromotion of science and literature. Knowledge is in every country\r\nthe surest basis of public happiness. In one in which the measures of\r\ngovernment receive their impressions so immediately from the sense of\r\nthe community as in ours it is proportionably essential. To the security\r\nof a free constitution it contributes in various ways--by convincing\r\nthose who are intrusted with the public administration that every\r\nvaluable end of government is best answered by the enlightened\r\nconfidence of the people, and by teaching the people themselves\r\nto know and to value their own rights; to discern and provide against\r\ninvasions of them; to distinguish between oppression and the necessary\r\nexercise of lawful authority; between burthens proceeding from a\r\ndisregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable\r\nexigencies of society; to discriminate the spirit of liberty from that\r\nof licentiousness--cherishing the first, avoiding the last--and uniting\r\na speedy but temperate vigilance against encroachments, with an\r\ninviolable respect to the laws.\r\n\r\nWhether this desirable object will be best promoted by affording aids\r\nto seminaries of learning already established, by the institution of a\r\nnational university, or by any other expedients will be well worthy of\r\na place in the deliberations of the Legislature.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI saw with peculiar pleasure at the close of the last session the\r\nresolution entered into by you expressive of your opinion that an\r\nadequate provision for the support of the public credit is a matter of\r\nhigh importance to the national honor and prosperity. In this sentiment\r\nI entirely concur; and to a perfect confidence in your best endeavors to\r\ndevise such a provision as will be truly consistent with the end I add\r\nan equal reliance on the cheerful cooperation of the other branch of the\r\nLegislature. It would be superfluous to specify inducements to a measure\r\nin which the character and permanent interests of the United States are\r\nso obviously and so deeply concerned, and which has received so explicit\r\na sanction from your declaration.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed the proper officers to lay before you, respectively,\r\nsuch papers and estimates as regard the affairs particularly recommended\r\nto your consideration, and necessary to convey to you that information\r\nof the state of the Union which it is my duty to afford.\r\n\r\nThe welfare of our country is the great object to which our cares and\r\nefforts ought to be directed, and I shall derive great satisfaction from\r\na cooperation with you in the pleasing though arduous task of insuring\r\nto our fellow-citizens the blessings which they have a right to expect\r\nfrom a free, efficient, and equal government.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: We, the Senate of the United States, return you our thanks for your\r\nspeech delivered to both Houses of Congress. The accession of the State\r\nof North Carolina to the Constitution of the United States gives us much\r\npleasure, and we offer you our congratulations on that event, which at\r\nthe same time adds strength to our Union and affords a proof that the\r\nmore the Constitution has been considered the more the goodness of it\r\nhas appeared. The information which we have received, that the measures\r\nof the last session have been as satisfactory to our constituents as we\r\nhad reason to expect from the difficulty of the work in which we were\r\nengaged, will afford us much consolation and encouragement in resuming\r\nour deliberations in the present session for the public good, and every\r\nexertion on our part shall be made to realize and secure to our country\r\nthose blessings which a gracious Providence has placed within her reach.\r\nWe are persuaded that one of the most effectual means of preserving\r\npeace is to be prepared for war, and our attention shall be directed to\r\nthe objects of common defense and to the adoption of such plans as shall\r\nappear the most likely to prevent our dependence on other countries\r\nfor essential supplies. In the arrangements to be made respecting the\r\nestablishment of such troops as may be deemed indispensable we shall\r\nwith pleasure provide for the comfortable support of the officers and\r\nsoldiers, with a due regard to economy. We regret that the pacific\r\nmeasures adopted by Government with regard to certain hostile tribes of\r\nIndians have not been attended with the beneficial effects toward the\r\ninhabitants of our Southern and Western frontiers which we had reason to\r\nhope; and we shall cheerfully cooperate in providing the most effectual\r\nmeans for their protection, and, if necessary, for the punishment\r\nof aggressors. The uniformity of the currency and of weights and\r\nmeasures, the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad\r\nand the exertions of skill and genius in producing them at home,\r\nthe facilitating the communication between the distant parts of our\r\ncountry by means of the post-office and post-roads, a provision for\r\nthe support of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and a uniform rule\r\nof naturalization, by which foreigners may be admitted to the rights of\r\ncitizens, are objects which shall receive such early attention as their\r\nrespective importance requires. Literature and science are essential\r\nto the preservation of a free constitution; the measures of Government\r\nshould therefore be calculated to strengthen the confidence that is\r\ndue to that important truth. Agriculture, commerce, and manufactures,\r\nforming the basis of the wealth and strength of our confederated\r\nRepublic, must be the frequent subject of our deliberation, and shall be\r\nadvanced by all proper means in our power. Public credit being an object\r\nof great importance, we shall cheerfully cooperate in all proper\r\nmeasures for its support. Proper attention shall be given to such papers\r\nand estimates as you may be pleased to lay before us. Our cares and\r\nefforts shall be directed to the welfare of our country, and we have the\r\nmost perfect dependence upon your cooperating with us on all occasions\r\nin such measures as will insure to our fellow-citizens the blessings\r\nwhich they have a right to expect from a free, efficient, and equal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 11, 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I thank you for your address, and for the assurances which it\r\ncontains of attention to the several matters suggested by me to your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nRelying on the continuance of your exertions for the public good, I\r\nanticipate for our country the salutary effects of upright and prudent\r\ncounsels.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 14, 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The Representatives of the people of the United States have taken\r\ninto consideration your speech to both Houses of Congress at the opening\r\nof the present session.\r\n\r\nWe reciprocate your congratulations on the accession of the State\r\nof North Carolina, an event which, while it is a testimony of the\r\nincreasing good will toward the Government of the Union, can not fail to\r\ngive additional dignity and strength to the American Republic, already\r\nrising in the estimation of the world in national character and\r\nrespectability.\r\n\r\nThe information that our measures of the last session have not proved\r\ndissatisfactory to our constituents affords us much encouragement at\r\nthis juncture, when we are resuming the arduous task of legislating for\r\nso extensive an empire.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more gratifying to the Representatives of a free people\r\nthan the reflection that their labors are rewarded by the approbation\r\nof their fellow-citizens. Under this impression we shall make every\r\nexertion to realize their expectations, and to secure to them those\r\nblessings which Providence has placed within their reach. Still prompted\r\nby the same desire to promote their interests which then actuated us,\r\nwe shall in the present session diligently and anxiously pursue those\r\nmeasures which shall appear to us conducive to that end.\r\n\r\nWe concur with you in the sentiment that agriculture, commerce, and\r\nmanufactures are entitled to legislative protection, and that the\r\npromotion of science and literature will contribute to the security of a\r\nfree Government; in the progress of our deliberations we shall not lose\r\nsight of objects so worthy of our regard.\r\n\r\nThe various and weighty matters which you have judged necessary to\r\nrecommend to our attention appear to us essential to the tranquillity\r\nand welfare of the Union, and claim our early and most serious\r\nconsideration. We shall proceed without delay to bestow on them that\r\ncalm discussion which their importance requires.\r\n\r\nWe regret that the pacific arrangements pursued with regard to certain\r\nhostile tribes of Indians have not been attended with that success which\r\nwe had reason to expect from them. We shall not hesitate to concur in\r\nsuch further measures as may best obviate any ill effects which might\r\nbe apprehended from the failure of those negotiations.\r\n\r\nYour approbation of the vote of this House at the last session\r\nrespecting the provision for the public creditors is very acceptable to\r\nus. The proper mode of carrying that resolution into effect, being a\r\nsubject in which the future character and happiness of these States are\r\ndeeply involved, will be among the first to deserve our attention.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of the United States is the primary object of all our\r\ndeliberations, and we cherish the reflection that every measure which\r\nwe may adopt for its advancement will not only receive your cheerful\r\nconcurrence, but will at the same time derive from your cooperation\r\nadditional efficacy, in insuring to our fellow-citizens the blessings\r\nof a free, efficient, and equal government.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 12, 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I receive with pleasure the assurances you give me that you\r\nwill diligently and anxiously pursue such measures as shall appear to\r\nyou conducive to the interest of your constituents, and that an early\r\nand serious consideration will be given to the various and weighty\r\nmatters recommended by me to your attention.\r\n\r\nI have full confidence that your deliberations will continue to be\r\ndirected by an enlightened and virtuous zeal for the happiness of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 14, 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 11, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nHaving advised with you upon the terms of a treaty to be offered to the\r\nCreek Nation of Indians, I think it proper you should be informed of\r\nthe result of that business previous to its coming before you in your\r\nlegislative capacity. I have therefore directed the Secretary for the\r\nDepartment of War to lay before you my instructions to the commissioners\r\nand their report in consequence thereof.\r\n\r\nThe apparently critical state of the Southern frontier will render it\r\nexpedient for me to communicate to both Houses of Congress, with other\r\npapers, the whole of the transactions relative to the Creeks, in order\r\nthat they may be enabled to form a judgment of the measures which the\r\ncase may require,\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 11, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed Mr. Lear, my private secretary, to lay before you a\r\ncopy of the adoption and ratification of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates by the State of North Carolina, together with a copy of a letter\r\nfrom His Excellency Samuel Johnston, president of the convention of said\r\nState, to the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe originals of the papers which are herewith transmitted to you will\r\nbe lodged in the office of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 12, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a statement of the Southwestern frontiers and of the\r\nIndian Department, which have been submitted to me by the Secretary for\r\nthe Department of War.\r\n\r\nI conceive that an unreserved but confidential communication of all the\r\npapers relative to the recent negotiations with some of the Southern\r\ntribes of Indians is indispensably requisite for the information of\r\nCongress. I am persuaded that they will effectually prevent either\r\ntranscripts or publications of all such circumstances as might be\r\ninjurious to the public interests,\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 21, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary for the Department of War has submitted to me certain\r\nprinciples to serve as a plan for the general arrangement of the militia\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nConceiving the subject to be of the highest importance to the welfare of\r\nour country and liable to be placed in various points of view, I have\r\ndirected him to lay the plan before Congress for their information, in\r\norder that they may make such use thereof as they may judge proper.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 25, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received from His Excellency John E. Howard, governor of the\r\nState of Maryland, an act of the legislature of Maryland to ratify\r\ncertain articles in addition to and amendment of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States of America, proposed by Congress to the legislatures of\r\nthe several States, and have directed my secretary to lay a copy of the\r\nsame before you, together with the copy of a letter, accompanying the\r\nabove act, from his excellency the governor of Maryland to the President\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe originals will be deposited in the office of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 28, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed my secretary to lay before you the copy of an act of the\r\nlegislature of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations entitled \"An act\r\nfor calling a convention to take into consideration the Constitution\r\nproposed for the United States, passed on the 17th day of September,\r\nA.D. 1787, by the General Convention held at Philadelphia,\" together\r\nwith the copy of a letter, accompanying said act, from His Excellency\r\nJohn Collins, governor of the State of Rhode Island and Providence\r\nPlantations, to the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe originals of the foregoing act and letter will be deposited in the\r\noffice of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 1, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received from His Excellency Alexander Martin, governor of the\r\nState of North Carolina, an act of the general assembly of that State\r\nentitled \"An act for the purpose of ceding to the United States of\r\nAmerica certain western lands therein described,\" and have directed my\r\nsecretary to lay a copy of the same before you, together with a copy of\r\na letter, accompanying said act, from His Excellency Governor Martin to\r\nthe President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe originals of the foregoing act and letter will be deposited in the\r\noffice of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 9, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_\r\n\r\nYou will perceive from the papers herewith delivered, and which are\r\nenumerated in the annexed list, that a difference subsists between Great\r\nBritain and the United States relative to the boundary line between our\r\neastern and their territories. A plan for deciding this difference was\r\nlaid before the late Congress, and whether that or some other plan of a\r\nlike kind would not now be eligible is submitted to your consideration.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it is desirable that all questions between this and other\r\nnations be speedily and amicably settled, and in this instance I think\r\nit advisable to postpone any negotiations on the subject until I shall\r\nbe informed of the result of your deliberations and receive your advice\r\nas to the propositions most proper to be offered on the part of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nAs I am taking measures for learning the intentions of Great Britain\r\nrespecting the further detention of our posts, etc., I am the more\r\nsolicitous that the business now submitted to you may be prepared for\r\nnegotiation as soon as the other important affairs which engage your\r\nattention will permit.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 15, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed my secretary to lay before you the copy of a vote of\r\nthe legislature of the State of New Hampshire, to accept the articles\r\nproposed in addition to and amendment of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates of America, except the second article. At the same time will be\r\ndelivered to you the copy of a letter from his excellency the president\r\nof the State of New Hampshire to the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe originals of the above-mentioned vote and letter will be lodged in\r\nthe office of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 18, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nBy the mail of last evening I received a letter from His Excellency John\r\nHancock, governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, inclosing a\r\nresolve of the senate and house of representatives of that Commonwealth\r\nand sundry documents relative to the eastern boundary of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI have directed a copy of the letter and resolve to be laid before you.\r\nThe documents which accompanied them being but copies of some of the\r\npapers which were delivered to you with my communication of the 9th of\r\nthis month, I have thought it unnecessary to lay them before you at this\r\ntime. They will be deposited in the office of the Secretary of State,\r\ntogether with the originals of the above-mentioned letters and resolve.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 8, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received from His Excellency Joshua Clayton, president of the\r\nState of Delaware, the articles proposed by Congress to the legislatures\r\nof the several States as amendments to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, which articles were transmitted to him for the consideration of\r\nthe legislature of Delaware, and are now returned with the following\r\nresolutions annexed to them, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The general assembly of Delaware having taken into their\r\n  consideration the above amendments, proposed by Congress to the\r\n  respective legislatures of the several States,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the first article be postponed;\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the general assembly do agree to the second, third,\r\n  fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and\r\n  twelfth articles, and we do hereby assent to, ratify, and confirm\r\n  the same as part of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n  In testimony whereof we have caused the great seal of the State to\r\n  be hereunto affixed this 28th day of January, A.D. 1790, and in the\r\n  fourteenth year of the independence of the Delaware State.\r\n\r\n\r\nSigned by order of council.\r\n\r\nGEORGE MITCHELL, _Speaker_.\r\n\r\nSigned by order of the house of assembly.\r\n\r\nJEHU DAVIS, _Speaker_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have directed a copy of the letter which accompanied the said\r\narticles, from His Excellency Joshua Clayton to the President of the\r\nUnited States, to be laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe before-mentioned articles and the original of the letter will be\r\nlodged in the office of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 16, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed my secretary to lay before you the copy of an act\r\nand the form of ratification of certain articles of amendment to the\r\nConstitution of the United States by the legislature of the State of\r\nPennsylvania, together with the copy of a letter which accompanied the\r\nsaid act, from the speaker of the house of assembly of Pennsylvania to\r\nthe President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe originals of the above will be lodged in the office of the Secretary\r\nof State.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 1, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed my private secretary to lay before you a copy of the\r\nadoption by the legislature of South Carolina of the articles proposed\r\nby Congress to the legislatures of the several States as amendments\r\nto the Constitution of the United States, together with the copy of\r\na letter from the governor of the State of South Carolina to the\r\nPresident of the United States, which have lately come to my hands.\r\n\r\nThe originals of the foregoing will be lodged in the office of the\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 5, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed my private secretary to lay before you copies of three\r\nacts of the legislature of the State of New York, which have been\r\ntransmitted to me by the governor thereof, viz:\r\n\r\n\"An act declaring it to be the duty of the sheriffs of the several\r\ncounties within this State to receive and safe keep such prisoners\r\nas shall be committed under the authority of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n\"An act for vesting in the United States of America the light-house\r\nand the lands thereunto belonging at Sandy Hook.\"\r\n\r\n\"An act ratifying certain articles in addition to and amendment of the\r\nConstitution of the United States of America, proposed by Congress.\"\r\n\r\nA copy of a letter accompanying said acts, from the governor of the\r\nState of New York to the President of the United States, will at the\r\nsame time be laid before you, and the originals be deposited in the\r\noffice of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 31, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nMr. de Poiery served in the American Army for several of the last years\r\nof the late war as secretary to Major-General the Marquis de Lafayette,\r\nand might probably at that time have obtained the commission of captain\r\nfrom Congress upon application to that body. At present he is an officer\r\nin the French national guards, and solicits a brevet commission from\r\nthe United States of America. I am authorized to add, that while the\r\ncompliance will involve no expense on our part, it will be particularly\r\ngrateful to that friend of America, the Marquis de Lafayette.\r\nI therefore nominate M. de Poiery to be a captain by brevet.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 1, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHaving received official information of the accession of the State of\r\nRhode Island and Providence Plantations to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, I take the earliest opportunity of communicating the\r\nsame to you, with my congratulations on this happy event, which unites\r\nunder the General Government all the States which were originally\r\nconfederated, and have directed my secretary to lay before you a copy\r\nof the letter from the president of the convention of the State of\r\nRhode Island to the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 11, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed my secretary to lay before you a copy of the\r\nratification of the amendments to the Constitution of the United States\r\nby the State of North Carolina, together with an extract from a letter,\r\naccompanying said ratification, from the governor of the State of North\r\nCarolina to the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 16, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe ratification of the Constitution of the United States of America by\r\nthe State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations was received by me\r\nlast night, together with a letter to the President of the United States\r\nfrom the president of the convention. I have directed my secretary to\r\nlay before you a copy of each.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 30, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAn act of the legislature of the State of Rhode Island and Providence\r\nPlantations, for ratifying certain articles as amendments to the\r\nConstitution of the United States, was yesterday put into my hands,\r\nand I have directed my secretary to lay a copy of the same before you.\r\n\r\nGO. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _August 4, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_;\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the general principles agreed to by the Senate in\r\nAugust, 1789, the adjustment of the terms of a treaty is far advanced\r\nbetween the United States and the chiefs of the Creek Indians, now in\r\nthis city, in behalf of themselves and the whole Creek Nation.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the articles of this treaty the present arrangements of\r\nthe trade with the Creeks have caused much embarrassment. It seems to\r\nbe well ascertained that the said trade is almost exclusively in the\r\nhands of a company of British merchants, who by agreement make their\r\nimportations of goods from England into the Spanish ports.\r\n\r\nAs the trade of the Indians is a main mean of their political\r\nmanagement, it is therefore obvious that the United States can not\r\npossess any security for the performance of treaties with the Creeks\r\nwhile their trade is liable to be interrupted or withheld at the caprice\r\nof two foreign powers.\r\n\r\nHence it becomes an object of real importance to form new channels for\r\nthe commerce of the Creeks through the United States. But this operation\r\nwill require time, as the present arrangements can not be suddenly\r\nbroken without the greatest violation of faith and morals.\r\n\r\nIt therefore appears to be important to form a secret article of a\r\ntreaty similar to the one which accompanies this message.\r\n\r\nIf the Senate should require any further explanation, the Secretary of\r\nWar will attend them for that purpose.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States states the following question for the\r\nconsideration and advice of the Senate: If it should be found essential\r\nto a treaty for the firm establishment of peace with the Creek Nation of\r\nIndians that an article to the following effect should be inserted\r\ntherein, will such an article be proper? viz:\r\n\r\nSECRET ARTICLE.\r\n\r\nThe commerce necessary for the Creek Nation shall be carried on through\r\nthe ports and by the citizens of the United States if substantial and\r\neffectual arrangements shall be made for that purpose by the United\r\nStates on or before the 1st day of August, 1792. In the meantime the\r\nsaid commerce may be carried on through its present channels and\r\naccording to its present regulations.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the trade of the said Creek Nation is now carried\r\non wholly or principally through the territories of Spain, and\r\nobstructions thereto may happen by war or prohibitions of the Spanish\r\nGovernment, it is therefore agreed between the said parties that in\r\nthe event of any such obstructions happening it shall be lawful for\r\nsuch persons as ---- ---- ---- ---- shall designate to introduce into\r\nand transport through the territories of the United States to the\r\ncountry of the said Creek Nation any quantity of goods, wares, and\r\nmerchandise not exceeding in value in any one year $60,000, and that\r\nfree from any duties or impositions whatsoever, but subject to such\r\nregulations for guarding against abuse as the United States shall judge\r\nnecessary, which privilege shall continue as long as such obstruction\r\nshall continue.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _August 6, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nConsidering the circumstances which prevented the late commissioners\r\nfrom concluding a peace with the Creek Nation of Indians, it appeared\r\nto me most prudent that all subsequent measures for disposing them to\r\na treaty should in the first instance be informal.\r\n\r\nI informed you on the 4th instant that the adjustment of the terms of\r\na treaty with their chiefs, now here, was far advanced. Such further\r\nprogress has since been made that I think measures may at present be\r\ntaken for conducting and concluding that business in form. It therefore\r\nbecomes necessary that a proper person be appointed and authorized to\r\ntreat with these chiefs and to conclude a treaty with them. For this\r\npurpose I nominate to you Henry Knox.\r\n\r\nGO. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _August 6, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed my secretary to lay before you a copy of an exemplified\r\ncopy of a law to ratify on the part of the State of New Jersey certain\r\namendments to the Constitution of the United States, together with a\r\ncopy of a letter, which accompanied said ratification, from Hon. Elisha\r\nLawrence, esq., vice-president of the State of New Jersey, to the\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\nGO. WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _August 7, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate:_\r\n\r\nI lay before you a treaty between the United States and the chiefs of\r\nthe Creek Nation, now in this city, in behalf of themselves and the\r\nwhole Creek Nation, subject to the ratification of the President of the\r\nUnited States with the advice and consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nWhile I flatter myself that this treaty will be productive of present\r\npeace and prosperity to our Southern frontier, it is to be expected that\r\nit will also in its consequences be the means of firmly attaching the\r\nCreeks and the neighboring tribes to the interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is to be hoped that it will afford solid grounds of\r\nsatisfaction to the State of Georgia, as it contains a regular, full,\r\nand definitive relinquishment on the part of the Creek Nation of the\r\nOconee land in the utmost extent in which it has been claimed by that\r\nState, and thus extinguishes the principal cause of those hostilities\r\nfrom which it has more than once experienced such severe calamities.\r\n\r\nBut although the most valuable of the disputed land is included, yet\r\nthere is a certain claim of Georgia, arising out of the treaty made by\r\nthat State at Galphinston in November, 1785, of land to the eastward of\r\na new temporary line from the forks of the Oconee and Oakmulgee in a\r\nsouthwest direction to the St. Marys River, which tract of land the\r\nCreeks in this city absolutely refuse to yield.\r\n\r\nThis land is reported to be generally barren, sunken, and unfit for\r\ncultivation, except in some instances on the margin of the rivers, on\r\nwhich by improvement rice might be cultivated, its chief value depending\r\non the timber fit for the building of ships, with which it is\r\nrepresented as abounding.\r\n\r\nWhile it is thus circumstanced on the one hand, it is stated by the\r\nCreeks on the other to be of the highest importance to them as\r\nconstituting some of their most valuable winter hunting ground.\r\n\r\nI have directed the commissioner to whom the charge of adjusting this\r\ntreaty has been committed to lay before you such papers and documents\r\nand to communicate to you such information relatively to it as you may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _August 11, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nAlthough the treaty with the Creeks may be regarded as the main\r\nfoundation of the future peace and prosperity of the Southwestern\r\nfrontier of the United States, yet in order fully to effect so desirable\r\nan object the treaties which have been entered into with the other\r\ntribes in that quarter must be faithfully performed on our parts.\r\n\r\nDuring the last year I laid before the Senate a particular statement of\r\nthe case of the Cherokees. By a reference to that paper it will appear\r\nthat the United States formed a treaty with the Cherokees in November,\r\n1785; that the said Cherokees thereby placed themselves under the\r\nprotection of the United States and had a boundary assigned them; that\r\nthe white people settled on the frontiers had openly violated the said\r\nboundary by intruding on the Indian lands; that the United States in\r\nCongress assembled did, on the 1st day of September, 1788, issue their\r\nproclamation forbidding all such unwarrantable intrusions, and enjoined\r\nall those who had settled upon the hunting grounds of the Cherokees to\r\ndepart with their families and effects without loss of time, as they\r\nwould answer their disobedience to the injunctions and prohibitions\r\nexpressed at their peril.\r\n\r\nBut information has been received that notwithstanding the said treaty\r\nand proclamation upward of 500 families have settled on the Cherokee\r\nlands exclusively of those settled between the fork of French Broad and\r\nHolstein rivers, mentioned in the said treaty.\r\n\r\nAs the obstructions to a proper conduct on this matter have been removed\r\nsince it was mentioned to the Senate on the 22d of August, 1789, by the\r\naccession of North Carolina to the present Union and the cessions of\r\nthe land in question, I shall conceive myself bound to exert the powers\r\nintrusted to me by the Constitution in order to carry into faithful\r\nexecution the treaty of Hopewell, unless it shall be thought proper to\r\nattempt to arrange a new boundary with the Cherokees, embracing the\r\nsettlements, and compensating the Cherokees for the cessions they shall\r\nmake on the occasion. On this point, therefore, I state the following\r\nquestions and request the advice of the Senate thereon:\r\n\r\nFirst. Is it the judgment of the Senate that overtures shall be made to\r\nthe Cherokees to arrange a new boundary so as to embrace the settlements\r\nmade by the white people since the treaty of Hopewell, in November, 1785?\r\n\r\nSecond. If so, shall compensation to the amount of ---- dollars\r\nannually, or of ---- dollars in gross, be made to the Cherokees for\r\nthe land they shall relinquish, holding the occupiers of the land\r\naccountable to the United States for its value?\r\n\r\nThird. Shall the United States stipulate solemnly to guarantee the new\r\nboundary which may be arranged?\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Gazette of the United States (New York), September 15, 1790,\r\nin the Library of Congress.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE: UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas a treaty of peace and friendship between the United States and\r\nthe Creek Nation was made and concluded on the 7th day of the present\r\nmonth of August; and\r\n\r\nWhereas I have, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, in due\r\nform ratified the said treaty:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, to the end that the same may be observed and performed\r\nwith good faith on the part of the United States, I have ordered the\r\nsaid treaty to be herewith published; and I do hereby enjoin and require\r\nall officers of the United States, civil and military, and all other\r\ncitizens and inhabitants thereof, faithfully to observe and fulfill the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, in the city of\r\nNew York, the 14th day of August, A.D. 1790, and in the fifteenth year\r\nof the Sovereignty and Independence of the United States.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Miscellaneous letters, Department of State, vol. 3.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas it hath at this time become peculiarly necessary to warn the\r\ncitizens of the United States against a violation of the treaties made\r\nat Hopewell, on the Keowee, on the 28th day of November, 1785, and on\r\nthe 3d and 10th days of January, 1786, between the United States and the\r\nCherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw nations of Indians, and to enforce an\r\nact entitled \"An act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian\r\ntribes,\" copies of which treaties and act are hereunto annexed, I have\r\ntherefore thought fit to require, and I do by these presents require,\r\nall officers of the United States, as well civil as military, and all\r\nother citizens and inhabitants thereof, to govern themselves according\r\nto the treaties and act aforesaid, as they will answer the contrary at\r\ntheir peril.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, in the city of\r\nNew York, the 26th day of August, A.D. 1790, and in the fifteenth year\r\nof the Sovereignty and Independence of the United States.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 8, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn meeting you again I feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my\r\ncongratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish\r\nour public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed\r\nour country with plenty and with the means of a flourishing commerce.\r\nThe progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of\r\nAmerican stock abroad as well as at home, and the revenues allotted\r\nfor this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the\r\ncalculations by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is\r\nthe more pleasing, as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our\r\nresources, but as it assures us of a further increase of the national\r\nrespectability and credit, and, let me add, as it bears an honorable\r\ntestimony to the patriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine\r\npart of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their\r\nengagements has been exemplary.\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the powers vested in me by acts of the last session,\r\na loan of 3,000,000 florins, toward which some provisional measures\r\nhad previously taken place, has been completed in Holland. As well\r\nthe celerity with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms\r\n(considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the\r\nsituation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution\r\nof those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury has my directions to communicate such further particulars\r\nas may be requisite for more precise information.\r\n\r\nSince your last sessions I have received communications by which it\r\nappears that the district of Kentucky, at present a part of Virginia,\r\nhas concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that State,\r\nin consequence of which the district is to become a distinct member of\r\nthe Union, in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this\r\nsanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very\r\nimportant transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony\r\nwith which it has been conducted will be found to do great honor to both\r\nthe parties, and the sentiments of warm attachment to the Union and its\r\npresent Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucky can not\r\nfail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the\r\ngreat national impressions under which you will decide on the case\r\nsubmitted to you.\r\n\r\nIt has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have\r\nbeen made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians\r\nfrom the northwest side of the Ohio. These, with some of the tribes\r\ndwelling on and near the Wabash, have of late been particularly active\r\nin their depredations, and being emboldened by the impunity of their\r\ncrimes and aided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be\r\nseduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their\r\nprisoners and plunder, they have, instead of listening to the humane\r\ninvitations and overtures made on the part of the United States, renewed\r\ntheir violences with fresh alacrity and greater effect. The lives of a\r\nnumber of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed, and some of them\r\nunder circumstances peculiarly shocking, whilst others have been carried\r\ninto a deplorable captivity.\r\n\r\nThese aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the\r\nWestern settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that\r\nthe Government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their\r\ncrimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and reward their\r\nattachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures,\r\nit became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President\r\nto call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers, and I have\r\naccordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular troops in\r\nthat quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were deemed\r\nsufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me. The Secretary\r\nof War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on\r\nwhich it is founded, as well as an estimate of the expense with which\r\nit will be attended.\r\n\r\nThe disturbed situation of Europe, and particularly the critical\r\nposture of the great maritime powers, whilst it ought to make us the\r\nmore thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United\r\nStates, reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it\r\nbecomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should\r\nnot overlook the tendency of a war, and even of preparations for a war,\r\namong the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country\r\nto abridge the means, and thereby at least enhance the price, of\r\ntransporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I\r\nrecommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may\r\nbe expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by\r\nsuch encouragements to our own navigation as will render our commerce\r\nand agriculture less dependent on foreign bottoms, which may fail us in\r\nthe very moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our\r\nfisheries and the transportation of our own produce offer us abundant\r\nmeans for guarding ourselves against this evil.\r\n\r\nYour attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our\r\ntrade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in\r\nrendering the present state of it distressful to us that you will not\r\nthink any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary\r\nsystem have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons.\r\nYou will consider in your wisdom whether improvements in that system may\r\nyet be made, and particularly whether an uniform process of execution on\r\nsentences issuing from the Federal courts be not desirable through all\r\nthe States.\r\n\r\nThe patronage of our commerce, of our merchants and seamen, has called\r\nfor the appointment of consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient\r\nto regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions\r\nwhich are permitted them, either by express convention or by a friendly\r\nindulgence, in the places of their residence. The consular convention,\r\ntoo, with His Most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the\r\naid of the national authority to his consuls established here. Some\r\nlegislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the militia, of a mint, of standards of weights and\r\nmeasures, of the post-office and post-roads are subjects which I presume\r\nyou will resume of course, and which are abundantly urged by their own\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects\r\nto which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary\r\nprovisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the\r\npublic faith stands now pledged. Allow me, moreover, to hope that it\r\nwill be a favorite policy with you, not merely to secure a payment of\r\nthe interest of the debt funded, but as far and as fast as the growing\r\nresources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal\r\nitself. The appropriation you have made of the Western land explains\r\nyour dispositions on this subject, and I am persuaded that the sooner\r\nthat valuable fund can be made to contribute, along with other means,\r\nto the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the\r\nmeasure be to every public interest, as well as the more satisfactory\r\nto our constituents.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the various and weighty business of the present session\r\nI indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally\r\nmarked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever\r\nbelongs to my duty you shall have all the cooperation which an\r\nundiminished zeal for its welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us\r\nboth, and our best reward, if, by a successful administration of our\r\nrespective trusts, we can make the established Government more and more\r\ninstrumental in promoting the good of our fellow-citizens, and more and\r\nmore the object of their attachment and confidence.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:\r\n\r\nWe receive, sir, with particular satisfaction the communications\r\ncontained in your speech, which confirm to us the progressive state\r\nof the public credit and afford at the same time a new proof of the\r\nsolidity of the foundation on which it rests; and we cheerfully join in\r\nthe acknowledgment which is due to the probity and patriotism of the\r\nmercantile and marine part of our fellow-citizens, whose enlightened\r\nattachment to the principles of good government is not less conspicuous\r\nin this than it has been in other important respects.\r\n\r\nIn confidence that every constitutional preliminary has been observed,\r\nwe assure you of our disposition to concur in giving the requisite\r\nsanction to the admission of Kentucky as a distinct member of the Union;\r\nin doing which we shall anticipate the happy effects to be expected from\r\nthe sentiments of attachment toward the Union and its present Government\r\nwhich have been expressed by the patriotic inhabitants of that district.\r\n\r\nWhile we regret that the continuance and increase of the hostilities and\r\ndepredations which have distressed our Northwestern frontiers should\r\nhave rendered offensive measures necessary, we feel an entire confidence\r\nin the sufficiency of the motives which have produced them and in the\r\nwisdom of the dispositions which have been concerted in pursuance of\r\nthe powers vested in you, and whatever may have been the event, we\r\nshall cheerfully concur in the provisions which the expedition that has\r\nbeen undertaken may require on the part of the Legislature, and in any\r\nother which the future peace and safety of our frontier settlements may\r\ncall for.\r\n\r\nThe critical posture of the European powers will engage a due portion\r\nof our attention, and we shall be ready to adopt any measures which a\r\nprudent circumspection may suggest for the preservation of the blessings\r\nof peace. The navigation and the fisheries of the United States are\r\nobjects too interesting not to inspire a disposition to promote them\r\nby all the means which shall appear to us consistent with their natural\r\nprogress and permanent prosperity.\r\n\r\nImpressed with the importance of a free intercourse with the\r\nMediterranean, we shall not think any deliberations misemployed which\r\nmay conduce to the adoption of proper measures for removing the\r\nimpediments that obstruct it.\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the judiciary system and the other important objects\r\nto which you have pointed our attention will not fail to engage the\r\nconsideration they respectively merit.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our deliberations upon every subject we shall rely\r\nupon that cooperation which an undiminished zeal and incessant anxiety\r\nfor the public welfare on your part so thoroughly insure; and as it is\r\nour anxious desire so it shall be our constant endeavor to render the\r\nestablished Government more and more instrumental in promoting the good\r\nof our fellow-citizens, and more and more the object of their attachment\r\nand confidence.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 10, 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: These assurances of favorable attention to the subjects\r\nI have recommended and of entire confidence in my views make the\r\nimpression on me which I ought to feel. I thank you for them both, and\r\nshall continue to rely much for the success of all our measures for the\r\npublic good on the aid they will receive from the wisdom and integrity\r\nof your councils.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 13, 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The Representatives of the people of the United States have taken\r\ninto consideration your address to the two Houses at the opening of the\r\npresent session of Congress.\r\n\r\nWe share in the satisfaction inspired by the prospects which continue to\r\nbe so auspicious to our public affairs. The blessings resulting from the\r\nsmiles of Heaven on our agriculture, the rise of public credit, with the\r\nfurther advantages promised by it, and the fertility of resources which\r\nare found so little burdensome to the community, fully authorize our\r\nmutual congratulations on the present occasion. Nor can we learn without\r\nan additional gratification that the energy of the laws for providing\r\nadequate revenues have been so honorably seconded by those classes of\r\ncitizens whose patriotism and probity were more immediately concerned.\r\n\r\nThe success of the loan opened in Holland, under the disadvantages of\r\nthe present moment, is the more important, as it not only denotes the\r\nconfidence already placed in the United States, but as the effect of a\r\njudicious application of that aid will still further illustrate the\r\nsolidity of the foundation on which the public credit rests.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory steps taken by the State of Virginia, in concert with\r\nthe district of Kentucky, toward the erection of the latter into a\r\ndistinct member of the Union exhibit a liberality mutually honorable to\r\nthe parties. We shall bestow on this important subject the favorable\r\nconsideration which it merits, and, with the national policy which ought\r\nto govern our decision, shall not fail to mingle the affectionate\r\nsentiments which are awakened by those expressed on behalf of our\r\nfellow-citizens of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nWhilst we regret the necessity which has produced offensive hostilities\r\nagainst some of the Indian tribes northwest of the Ohio, we sympathize\r\ntoo much with our Western brethren not to behold with approbation the\r\nwatchfulness and vigor which have been exerted by the executive\r\nauthority for their protection, and which we trust will make the\r\naggressors sensible that it is their interest to merit by a peaceable\r\nbehavior the friendship and humanity which the United States are always\r\nready to extend to them.\r\n\r\nThe encouragement of our own navigation has at all times appeared to us\r\nhighly important. The point of view under which you have recommended\r\nit to us is strongly enforced by the actual state of things in Europe.\r\nIt will be incumbent on us to consider in what mode our commerce and\r\nagriculture can be best relieved from an injurious dependence on the\r\nnavigation of other nations, which the frequency of their wars renders\r\na too precarious resource for conveying the productions of our country\r\nto market.\r\n\r\nThe present state of our trade to the Mediterranean seems not less to\r\ndemand, and will accordingly receive, the attention which you have\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nHaving already concurred in establishing a judiciary system which opens\r\nthe doors of justice to all, without distinction of persons, it will be\r\nour disposition to incorporate every improvement which experience may\r\nsuggest. And we shall consider in particular how far the uniformity\r\nwhich in other cases is found convenient in the administration of the\r\nGeneral Government through all the States may be introduced into the\r\nforms and rules of executing sentences issuing from the Federal courts.\r\n\r\nThe proper regulation of the jurisdiction and functions which may be\r\nexercised by consuls of the United States in foreign countries, with the\r\nprovisions stipulated to those of His Most Christian Majesty established\r\nhere, are subjects of too much consequence to the public interest and\r\nhonor not to partake of our deliberations.\r\n\r\nWe shall renew our attention to the establishment of the militia and the\r\nother subjects unfinished at the last session, and shall proceed in them\r\nwith all the dispatch which the magnitude of all and the difficulty of\r\nsome of them will allow.\r\n\r\nNothing has given us more satisfaction than to find that the revenues\r\nheretofore established have proved adequate to the purposes to which\r\nthey were allotted. In extending the provision to the residuary objects\r\nit will be equally our care to secure sufficiency and punctuality in the\r\npayments due from the Treasury of the United States. We shall also never\r\nlose sight of the policy of diminishing the public debt as fast as the\r\nincrease of the public resources will permit, and are particularly\r\nsensible of the many considerations which press a resort to the\r\nauxiliary resource furnished by the public lands.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing every branch of the weighty business of the present session\r\nit will be our constant study to direct our deliberations to the public\r\nwelfare. Whatever our success may be, we can at least answer for the\r\nfervent love of our country, which ought to animate our endeavors.\r\nIn your cooperation we are sure of a resource which fortifies our\r\nhopes that the fruits of the established Government will justify the\r\nconfidence which has been placed in it, and recommend it more and more\r\nto the affection and attachment of our fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 11, 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: The sentiments expressed in your address are entitled to my\r\nparticular acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nHaving no object but the good of our country, this testimony of\r\napprobation and confidence from its immediate Representatives must be\r\namong my best rewards, as the support of your enlightened patriotism has\r\nbeen among my greatest encouragements. Being persuaded that you will\r\ncontinue to be actuated by the same auspicious principle, I look forward\r\nto the happiest consequences from your deliberations during the present\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 13, 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 23, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt appearing by the report of the secretary of the government northwest\r\nof the Ohio that there are certain cases respecting grants of land\r\nwithin that territory which require the interference of the Legislature\r\nof the United States, I have directed a copy of said report and the\r\npapers therein referred to to be laid before you, together with a copy\r\nof the report of the Secretary of State upon the same subject.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 30, 1790_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a report of the Secretary of State on the subject of\r\nthe citizens of the United States in captivity at Algiers, that you may\r\nprovide on their behalf what to you shall seem most expedient.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 3, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a copy of an exemplified copy of an act passed by the\r\nlegislature of the State of New Jersey for vesting in the United States\r\nof America the jurisdiction of a lot of land at Sandy Hook, in the\r\ncounty of Monmouth, and a copy of a letter which accompanied said act,\r\nfrom the governor of the State of New Jersey to the President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 17, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you an official statement of the appropriation of $10,000,\r\ngranted to defray the contingent expenses of Government by an act of the\r\n26th March, 1790.\r\n\r\nA copy of two resolutions of the legislature of Virginia, and a petition\r\nof sundry officers and assignees of officers and soldiers of the\r\nVirginia line on continental establishment, on the subject of bounty\r\nlands allotted to them on the northwest side of the Ohio; and\r\n\r\nA copy of an act of the legislature of Maryland to empower the wardens\r\nof the port of Baltimore to levy and collect the duty therein mentioned.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 17, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a letter from His Most Christian Majesty, addressed to\r\nthe President and Members of Congress of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To our very dear friends and allies, the President and Members of\r\nthe General Congress of the United States of North America_.\r\n\r\nVERY DEAR GREAT FRIENDS AND ALLIES: We have received the letter by which\r\nyou inform us of the new mark of confidence that you have shown to\r\nMr. Jefferson, and which puts a period to his appointment of minister\r\nplenipotentiary at our Court.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which he conducted during his residence with us has\r\nmerited our esteem and entire approbation, and it is with pleasure that\r\nwe now give him this testimony of it.\r\n\r\nIt is with the most sincere pleasure that we embrace this opportunity of\r\nrenewing these assurances of regard and friendship which we feel for the\r\nUnited States in general and for each of them in particular. Under their\r\ninfluence we pray God that He will keep you, very dear friends and\r\nallies, under His holy and beneficent protection.\r\n\r\nDone at Paris this 11th September, 1790.\r\n\r\nYour good friend and ally,\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\n\r\nMONTMORIN. [SEAL.]\r\n\r\nThe UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 10, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a representation of the chargé d'affaires of France,\r\nmade by order of his Court, on the acts of Congress of the 20th of\r\nJuly, 1789 and 1790, imposing an extra tonnage on foreign vessels,\r\nnot excepting those of that country, together with the report of\r\nthe Secretary of State thereon, and I recommend the same to your\r\nconsideration, that I may be enabled to give to it such answer as may\r\nbest comport with the justice and the interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 18, 1791.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State having received from the chargé d'affaires of\r\nFrance a note on the tonnage payable by French vessels in the ports of\r\nthe United States, has had the same under his consideration, and\r\nthereupon makes the following report to the President of the United\r\nStates:\r\n\r\nThe chargé d'affaires of France, by a note of the 13th of December,\r\nrepresents, by order of his Court, that they consider so much of the\r\nacts of Congress of July 20, 1789 and 1790, as imposes an extraordinary\r\ntonnage on foreign vessels without excepting those of France, to be in\r\ncontravention of the fifth article of the treaty of amity and commerce\r\nbetween the two nations; that this would have authorized on their\r\npart a proportional modification in the favors granted to the American\r\nnavigation, but that his Sovereign had thought it more conformable to\r\nhis principles of friendship and attachment to the United States to\r\norder him to make representations thereon, and to ask in favor of French\r\nvessels a modification of the acts which impose an extraordinary tonnage\r\non foreign vessels.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State, in giving in this paper to the President of the\r\nUnited States, thinks it his duty to accompany it with the following\r\nobservations:\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth articles of the treaty of amity and commerce\r\nbetween France and the United States subject the vessels of each nation\r\nto pay in the ports of the other only such duties as are paid by the\r\nmost favored nation, and give them reciprocally all the privileges and\r\nexemptions in navigation and commerce which are given by either to the\r\nmost favored nations. Had the contracting parties stopped here, they\r\nwould have been free to raise or lower their tonnage as they should find\r\nit expedient, only taking care to keep the other on the footing of the\r\nmost favored nation. The question, then, is whether the fifth article\r\ncited in the note is anything more than an application of the principle\r\ncomprised in the third and fourth to a particular object, or whether it\r\nis an additional stipulation of something not so comprised.\r\n\r\nI. That it is merely an application of a principle comprised in the\r\npreceding articles is declared by the express words of the article, to\r\nwit: \"_Dans l'exemption ci-dessus est nommément compris_,\" etc., \"_in\r\nthe above exemption is particularly comprised_, the imposition of 100\r\nsols per ton established in France on foreign vessels.\" Here, then, is\r\nat once an express declaration that the exemption from the duty of 100\r\nsols is _comprised_ in the third and fourth articles; that is to say,\r\nit was one of the exemptions enjoyed by the most favored nations, and\r\nas such extended to us by those articles. If the exemption spoken of in\r\nthis first member of the fifth article was _comprised_ in the third and\r\nfourth articles, as is expressly declared, then the reservation by\r\nFrance out of that exemption (which makes the second member of the same\r\narticle) _was also comprised_; that is to say, if _the whole_ was\r\ncomprised, _the part_ was comprised. And if this reservation of France\r\nin the second member was comprised in the third and fourth articles,\r\nthen the counter reservation by the United States (which constitutes the\r\nthird and last member of the same article) was also comprised, because\r\nit is but a corresponding portion of a similar whole on our part, which\r\nhad been comprised by the same terms with theirs.\r\n\r\nIn short, the whole article relates to a particular duty of 100 sols,\r\nlaid by some antecedent law of France on the vessels of foreign nations,\r\nrelinquished as to the most favored, and consequently to us. It is not a\r\nnew and additional stipulation, then, but a declared application of the\r\nstipulations comprised in the preceding articles to a particular case by\r\nway of greater caution.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine laid down generally in the third and fourth articles,\r\nand exemplified specially in the fifth, amounts to this: \"The vessels\r\nof the most favored nations coming from foreign ports are exempted from\r\nthe duty of 100 sols; therefore you are exempted from it by the third\r\nand fourth articles. The vessels of the most favored nations coming\r\ncoastwise pay that duty; therefore you are to pay it by the third and\r\nfourth articles. We shall not think it unfriendly in you to lay a\r\nlike duty on coasters, because it will be no more than we have done\r\nourselves. You are free also to lay that or any other duty on vessels\r\ncoming from foreign ports, provided they apply to all other nations,\r\neven the most favored. We are free to do the same under the same\r\nrestriction. Our exempting you from a duty which the most favored\r\nnations do not pay does not exempt you from one which they do pay.\"\r\n\r\nIn this view, it is evident that the fifth article neither enlarges\r\nnor abridges the stipulations of the third and fourth. The effect of\r\nthe treaty would have been precisely the same had it been omitted\r\naltogether; consequently it may be truly said that the reservation by\r\nthe United States in this article is completely useless. And it may be\r\nadded with equal truth that the equivalent reservation by France is\r\ncompletely useless, as well as her previous abandonment of the same\r\nduty, and, in short, the whole article. Each party, then, remains free\r\nto raise or lower its tonnage, provided the change operates on all\r\nnations, even the most favored.\r\n\r\nWithout undertaking to affirm, we may obviously conjecture that this\r\narticle has been inserted on the part of the United States from an\r\novercaution to guard, _nommément, by name_, against a particular\r\naggrievance, which they thought they could never be too well secured\r\nagainst; and that has happened which generally happens--doubts have been\r\nproduced by the too great number of words used to prevent doubt.\r\n\r\nII. The Court of France, however, understands this article as intended\r\nto introduce something to which the preceding articles had not reached,\r\nand not merely as an application of them to a particular case. Their\r\nopinion seems to be founded on the general rule in the construction of\r\ninstruments, to leave no words merely useless for which any rational\r\nmeaning can be found. They say that the reservation by the United States\r\nof a right to lay a duty equivalent to that of the 100 sols, reserved\r\nby France, would have been completely useless if they were left free\r\nby the preceding articles to lay a tonnage to any extent whatever;\r\nconsequently, that the reservation of a part proves a relinquishment\r\nof the residue.\r\n\r\nIf some meaning, and such a one, is to be given to the last member\r\nof the article, some meaning, and a similar one, must be given to the\r\ncorresponding member. If the reservation by the United States of a right\r\nto lay an equivalent duty implies a relinquishment of their right to\r\nlay any other, the reservation by France of a right to continue the\r\nspecified duty to which it is an equivalent must imply a relinquishment\r\nof the right on her part to lay or continue any other. Equivalent\r\nreservations by both must imply equivalent restrictions on both.\r\nThe exact reciprocity stipulated in the preceding articles, and which\r\npervades every part of the treaty, insures a counter right to each\r\nparty for every right ceded to the other.\r\n\r\nLet it be further considered that the duty called _tonnage_ in the\r\nUnited States is in lieu of the duties for anchorage, for the support of\r\nbuoys, beacons, and light-houses, to guide the mariner into harbor and\r\nalong the coast, which are provided and supported at the expense of the\r\nUnited States, and for fees to measurers, weighers, gangers, etc., who\r\nare paid by the United States, for which articles, among many others\r\n(light-house money excepted), duties are paid by us in the ports of\r\nFrance under their specific names. That Government has hitherto thought\r\nthese duties consistent with the treaty, and consequently the same\r\nduties under a general instead of specific names, with us, must be\r\nequally consistent with it. It is not the name, but the thing, which is\r\nessential. If we have renounced the right to lay any port duties, they\r\nmust be understood to have equally renounced that of either laying new\r\nor continuing the old. If we ought to refund the port duties received\r\nfrom their vessels since the date of the act of Congress, they should\r\nrefund the port duties they have received from our vessels since the\r\ndate of the treaty, for nothing short of this is the reciprocity of\r\nthe treaty.\r\n\r\nIf this construction be adopted, then each party has forever renounced\r\nthe right of laying any duties on the vessels of the other coming from\r\nany foreign port, or more than 100 sols on those coming coastwise. Could\r\nthis relinquishment be confined to the two contracting parties alone,\r\nthe United States would be the gainers, for it is well known that a much\r\ngreater number of American than of French vessels are employed in the\r\ncommerce between the two countries; but the exemption once conceded by\r\nthe one nation to the other becomes immediately the property of all\r\nothers who are on the footing of the most favored nations. It is true\r\nthat those others would be obliged to yield the same compensation, that\r\nis to say, to receive our vessels duty free. Whether we should gain or\r\nlose in the exchange of the measure with them is not easy to say.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of this construction will be that the vessels of the\r\nmost favored nations paying no duties will be on a better footing than\r\nthose of natives which pay a moderate duty; consequently either the duty\r\non these also must be given up or they will be supplanted by foreign\r\nvessels in our own ports.\r\n\r\nThe resource, then, of duty on vessels for the purposes either of\r\nrevenue or regulation will be forever lost to both. It is hardly\r\nconceivable that either party looking forward to all these consequences\r\nwould see their interest in them.\r\n\r\nIII. But if France persists in claiming this exemption, what is to\r\nbe done? The claim, indeed, is couched in mild and friendly terms;\r\nbut the idea leaks out that a refusal would authorize them to modify\r\nproportionally the favors granted by the same article to our navigation.\r\nPerhaps they may do what we should feel much more severely, they may\r\nturn their eyes to the favors granted us by their arrets of December 29,\r\n1787, and December 7, 1788, which hang on their will alone, unconnected\r\nwith the treaty. Those arrets, among other advantages, admit our whale\r\noils to the exclusion of that of all other foreigners. And this monopoly\r\nprocures a vent for seven-twelfths of the produce of that fishery, which\r\nexperience has taught us could find no other market. Near two-thirds of\r\nthe produce of our cod fisheries, too, have lately found a free vent in\r\nthe colonies of France. This, indeed, has been an irregularity growing\r\nout of the anarchy reigning in those colonies. Yet the demands of the\r\ncolonists, even of the Government party among them (if an auxiliary\r\ndisposition can be excited by some marks of friendship and distinction\r\non our part), may perhaps produce a constitutional concession to them\r\nto procure their provisions at the cheapest market; that is to say,\r\nat ours.\r\n\r\nConsidering the value of the interests we have at stake and\r\nconsidering the smallness of difference between foreign and native\r\ntonnage on French vessels alone, it might perhaps be thought advisable\r\nto make the sacrifice asked, and especially if it can be so done as\r\nto give no title to other the most favored nations to claim it. If the\r\nact should put French vessels on the footing of those of natives, and\r\ndeclare it to be in consideration of the favors granted us by the arrets\r\nof December 29, 1787, and December 7, 1788 (and perhaps this would\r\nsatisfy them), no nation could then demand the same favor without\r\noffering an equivalent compensation. It might strengthen, too, the\r\ntenure by which those arrets are held, which must be precarious so\r\nlong as they are gratuitous.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable in many instances to exchange mutual advantages by\r\nlegislative acts rather than by treaty, because the former, though\r\nunderstood to be in consideration of each other, and therefore greatly\r\nrespected, yet when they become too inconvenient can be dropped at\r\nthe will of either party; whereas stipulations by treaty are forever\r\nirrevocable but by joint consent, let a change of circumstances render\r\nthem ever so burdensome.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, if it be the opinion that the first construction is to be\r\ninsisted on as ours, in opposition to the second urged by the Court of\r\nFrance, and that no relaxation is to be admitted, an answer shall be\r\ngiven to that Court defending that construction, and explaining in as\r\nfriendly terms as possible the difficulties opposed to the exemption\r\nthey claim.\r\n\r\n2. If it be the opinion that it is advantageous for us to close with\r\nFrance in her interpretation of a reciprocal and perpetual exemption\r\nfrom tonnage, a repeal of so much of the tonnage law will be the answer.\r\n\r\n3. If it be thought better to waive rigorous and nice discussions of\r\nright and to make the modification an act of friendship and of\r\ncompensation for favors received, the passage of such a bill will then\r\nbe the answer.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\n_L.G. Otto to the Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, _December 13, 1790_.\r\n\r\nSIR: During the long stay you made in France you had opportunities of\r\nbeing satisfied of the favorable dispositions of His Majesty to render\r\npermanent the ties that united the two nations and to give stability to\r\nthe treaties of alliance and of commerce which form the basis of this\r\nunion. These treaties were so well maintained by the Congress formed\r\nunder the ancient Confederation that they thought it their duty to\r\ninterpose their authority whenever any laws made by individual States\r\nappeared to infringe their stipulations, and particularly in 1785,\r\nwhen the States of New Hampshire and of Massachusetts had imposed an\r\nextraordinary tonnage on foreign vessels without exempting those of the\r\nFrench nation. The reflections that I have the honor to address to you\r\nin the subjoined note being founded on the same principles, I flatter\r\nmyself that they will merit on the part of the Government of the United\r\nStates the most serious attention.\r\n\r\nI am, with respect, etc.,\r\n\r\nL.G. OTTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\n_L.G. Otto to the Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, _December 13, 1790_.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The underwritten, chargé d'affaires of France, has received the\r\nexpress order of his Court to represent to the United States that the\r\nact passed by Congress the 20th July, 1789, and renewed the 20th July\r\nof the present year, which imposes an extraordinary tonnage on foreign\r\nvessels without excepting French vessels, is directly contrary to the\r\nspirit and to the object of the treaty of commerce which unites the two\r\nnations, and of which His Majesty has not only scrupulously observed the\r\ntenor, but of which he has extended the advantages by many regulations\r\nvery favorable to the commerce and navigation of the United States.\r\n\r\nBy the fifth article of this treaty the citizens of these States are\r\ndeclared exempt from the tonnage duty imposed in France on foreign\r\nvessels, and they are not subject to that duty but in the coasting\r\nbusiness. Congress has reserved the privilege of establishing _a duty\r\nequivalent to this last_, a stipulation founded on the state in which\r\nmatters were in America at the time of the signature of the treaty.\r\nThere did not exist at that epoch any duty on tonnage in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that it was the nonexistence of this duty and the motive\r\nof a perfect reciprocity stipulated in the preamble of the treaty that\r\nhad determined the King to grant the exemption contained in the article\r\nfifth; and a proof that Congress had no intention to contravene this\r\nreciprocity is that _it only reserves a privilege of establishing on the\r\ncoasting business a duty equivalent to that which is levied in France_.\r\nThis reservation would have been completely useless if by the words of\r\nthe treaty Congress thought themselves at liberty to lay _any_ tonnage\r\nthey should think proper on French vessels.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has the honor to observe that this contravention of\r\nthe fifth article of the treaty of commerce might have authorized\r\nHis Majesty to modify proportionately the favors granted by the same\r\narticle to the American navigation; but the King, always faithful to\r\nthe principles of friendship and attachment to the United States, and\r\ndesirous of strengthening more and more the ties which subsist so\r\nhappily between the French nation and these States, thinks it\r\nmore conformable to these views to order the undersigned to make\r\nrepresentations on this subject, and to ask in favor of French vessels\r\na modification of the act which imposes an extraordinary tonnage on\r\nforeign vessels. His Majesty does not doubt but that the United States\r\nwill acknowledge the justice of this claim, and will be disposed to\r\nrestore things to the footing on which they were at the signature of\r\nthe treaty of the 6th February, 1778.\r\n\r\nL.G. OTTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\n_L.G. Otto to the Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _January 8, 1791_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency M. JEFFERSON,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have the honor herewith to send you a letter from the King to\r\nCongress, and one which M. de Montmorin has written to yourself. You\r\nwill find therein the sincere sentiments with which you have inspired\r\nour Government, and the regret of the minister in not having a more near\r\nrelation of correspondence with you. In these every person who has had\r\nthe advantage of knowing you in France participates.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it gives me pain, sir, to be obliged to announce to\r\nyou that the complaints of our merchants on the subject of the tonnage\r\nduty increase, and that they have excited not only the attention of the\r\nKing but that of several departments of the Kingdom. I have received new\r\norders to request of the United States a decision on this matter and\r\nto solicit in favor of the aggrieved merchants the restitution of the\r\nduties which have already been paid. I earnestly beg of you, sir, not to\r\nlose sight of an object which, as I have already had the honor to tell\r\nyou verbally, is of the greatest importance for cementing the future\r\ncommercial connections between the two nations.\r\n\r\nIn more particularly examining this question you will perhaps find that\r\nmotives of convenience are as powerful as those of justice to engage the\r\nUnited States to give to His Majesty the satisfaction which he requires.\r\nAt least twice as many American vessels enter the ports of France as do\r\nthose of France the ports of America. The exemption of the tonnage of\r\nduty, then, is evidently less advantageous for the French than for the\r\nnavigators of the United States. Be this as it may, I can assure you,\r\nsir, that the delay of a decision in this respect by augmenting the just\r\ncomplaints of the French merchants will only augment the difficulties.\r\n\r\nI therefore beg of you to enable me before the sailing of the packet,\r\nwhich will take place toward the last of this month, to give to my Court\r\na satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\nL.G. OTTO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 24, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a statement relative to the frontiers of the United\r\nStates, which has been submitted to me by the Secretary for the\r\nDepartment of War.\r\n\r\nI rely upon your wisdom to make such arrangements as may be essential\r\nfor the preservation of good order and the effectual protection of the\r\nfrontiers.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 24, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn execution of the powers with which Congress were pleased to invest\r\nme by their act entitled \"An act for establishing the temporary and\r\npermanent seat of Government of the United States,\" and on mature\r\nconsideration of the advantages and disadvantages of the several\r\npositions within the limits prescribed by the said act, I have by\r\na proclamation bearing date this day (a copy of which is herewith\r\ntransmitted) directed commissioners, appointed in pursuance of the act,\r\nto survey and limit a part of the territory of 10 miles square on both\r\nsides of the river Potomac, so as to comprehend Georgetown, in Maryland,\r\nand extend to the Eastern Branch.\r\n\r\nI have not by this first act given to the said territory the whole\r\nextent of which it is susceptible in the direction of the river, because\r\nI thought it important that Congress should have an opportunity of\r\nconsidering whether by an amendatory law they would authorize the\r\nlocation of the residue at the lower end of the present, so as to\r\ncomprehend the Eastern Branch itself and some of the country on its\r\nlower side, in the State of Maryland, and the town of Alexandria, in\r\nVirginia. If, however, they are of opinion that the Federal territory\r\nshould be bounded by the water edge of the Eastern Branch, the location\r\nof the residue will be to be made at the upper end of what is now\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nI have thought best to await a survey of the territory before it is\r\ndecided on what particular spot on the northeastern side of the river\r\nthe public buildings shall be erected.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 26, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you the copy of a letter from the President of the\r\nNational Assembly of France to the President of the United States,\r\nand of a decree of that Assembly, which was transmitted with the\r\nabove-mentioned letter.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 27, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn order that you may be fully informed of the situation of the\r\nfrontiers and the prospect of hostility in that quarter, I lay before\r\nyou the intelligence of some recent depredations, received since my\r\nmessage to you upon this subject of the 24th instant.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 9, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received from the governor of Vermont authentic documents,\r\nexpressing the consent of the legislatures of New York and of the\r\nTerritory of Vermont that the said Territory shall be admitted to be a\r\ndistinct member of our Union; and a memorial of Nathaniel Chipman and\r\nLewis R. Morris, commissioners from the said Territory, praying the\r\nconsent of Congress to that admission, by the name and style of the\r\nState of Vermont, copies of which I now lay before Congress, with\r\nwhom the Constitution has vested the object of these proceedings.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 14, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nSoon after I was called to the administration of the Government I found\r\nit important to come to an understanding with the Court of London on\r\nseveral points interesting to the United States, and particularly to\r\nknow whether they were disposed to enter into arrangements by mutual\r\nconsent which might fix the commerce between the two nations on\r\nprinciples of reciprocal advantage. For this purpose I authorized\r\ninformal conferences with their ministers, and from these I do not infer\r\nany disposition on their part to enter into any arrangements merely\r\ncommercial. I have thought it proper to give you this information, as it\r\nmight at some time have influence on matters under your consideration.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 14, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nConceiving that in the possible event of a refusal of justice on the\r\npart of Great Britain we should stand less committed should it be made\r\nto a private rather than to a public person, I employed Mr. Gouverneur\r\nMorris, who was on the spot, and without giving him any definite\r\ncharacter, to enter informally into the conferences before mentioned.\r\nFor your more particular information I lay before you the instructions\r\nI gave him and those parts of his communications wherein the British\r\nministers appear either in conversation or by letter. These are two\r\nletters from the Duke of Leeds to Mr. Morris, and three letters of Mr.\r\nMorris giving an account of two conferences with the Duke of Leeds and\r\none with him and Mr. Pitt. The sum of these is that they declare without\r\nscruple they do not mean to fulfill what remains of the treaty of peace\r\nto be fulfilled on their part (by which we are to understand the\r\ndelivery of the posts and payment for property carried off) till\r\nperformance on our part, and compensation where the delay has rendered\r\nthe performance now impracticable; that on the subject of a treaty of\r\ncommerce they avoided direct answers, so as to satisfy Mr. Morris they\r\ndid not mean to enter into one unless it could be extended to a treaty\r\nof alliance offensive and defensive, or unless in the event of a rupture\r\nwith Spain.\r\n\r\nAs to the sending a minister here, they made excuses at the first\r\nconference, seemed disposed to it in the second, and in the last express\r\nan intention of so doing.\r\n\r\nTheir views being thus sufficiently ascertained, I have directed\r\nMr. Morris to discontinue his communications with them.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 18, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe aspect of affairs in Europe during the last summer, and especially\r\nbetween Spain and England, gave reason to expect a favorable occasion\r\nfor pressing to accommodation the unsettled matters between them and us.\r\nMr. Carmichael, our charge d'affaires at Madrid, having been long absent\r\nfrom his country, great changes having taken place in our circumstances\r\nand sentiments during that interval, it was thought expedient to send\r\nsome person, in a private character, fully acquainted with the present\r\nstate of things here, to be the bearer of written and confidential\r\ninstructions to him, and at the same time to possess him in full and\r\nfrequent conversations of all those details of facts and topics of\r\nargument which could not be conveyed in writing, but which would be\r\nnecessary to enable him to meet the reasonings of that Court with\r\nadvantage. Colonel David Humphreys was therefore sent for these\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAn additional motive for this confidential mission arose in the same\r\nquarter. The Court of Lisbon had on several occasions made the most\r\namicable advances for cultivating friendship and intercourse with\r\nthe United States. The exchange of a diplomatic character had been\r\ninformally, but repeatedly, suggested on their part. It was our interest\r\nto meet this nation in its friendly dispositions and to concur in the\r\nexchange proposed. But my wish was at the same time that the character\r\nto be exchanged should be of the lowest and most economical grade. To\r\nthis it was known that certain rules of long standing at that Court\r\nwould produce obstacles. Colonel Humphreys was charged with dispatches\r\nto the prime minister of Portugal and with instructions to endeavor to\r\narrange this to our views. It happened, however, that previous to his\r\narrival at Lisbon the Queen had appointed a minister _resident_ to the\r\nUnited States. This embarrassment seems to have rendered the difficulty\r\ncompletely insurmountable. The minister of that Court in his conferences\r\nwith Colonel Humphreys, professing every wish to accommodate, yet\r\nexpresses his regrets that circumstances do not permit them to concur\r\nin the grade of chargé d'affaires, a grade of little privilege or\r\nrespectability by the rules of their Court and held in so low estimation\r\nwith them that no proper character would accept it to go abroad. In a\r\nletter to the Secretary of State he expresses the same sentiments, and\r\nannounces the appointment on their part of a minister _resident_ to\r\nthe United States, and the pleasure with which the Queen will receive\r\none from us at her Court. A copy of his letter, and also of Colonel\r\nHumphreys's giving the details of this transaction, will be delivered\r\nto you.\r\n\r\nOn consideration of all circumstances I have determined to accede to\r\nthe desire of the Court of Lisbon in the article of grade. I am aware\r\nthat the consequences will not end here, and that this is not the\r\nonly instance in which a like change may be pressed. But should it be\r\nnecessary to yield elsewhere also, I shall think it a less evil than\r\nto disgust a government so friendly and so interesting to us as that\r\nof Portugal.\r\n\r\nI do not mean that the change of grade shall render the mission more\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nI have therefore nominated David Humphreys minister resident from the\r\nUnited States to Her Most Faithful Majesty the Queen of Portugal.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 22, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI will proceed to take measures for the ransom of our citizens in\r\ncaptivity at Algiers, in conformity with your resolution of advice of\r\nthe 1st instant, so soon as the moneys necessary shall be appropriated\r\nby the Legislature and shall be in readiness.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of our treaty with the new Emperor of Morocco requires\r\nalso previous appropriation and provision. The importance of this last\r\nto the liberty and property of our citizens induces me to urge it on\r\nyour earliest attention.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 23, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nInformation having been received from Thomas Auldjo, who was appointed\r\nvice-consul of the United States at Cowes, in Great Britain, that his\r\ncommission has not been recognized by that Government because it is a\r\nport at which no foreign consul has yet been received, and that it has\r\nbeen intimated to him that his appointment to the port of Poole and\r\nparts nearer to that than to the residence of any other consul of the\r\nUnited States would be recognized and his residence at Cowes not\r\nnoticed, I have therefore thought it expedient to nominate Thomas Auldjo\r\nto be vice-consul for the United States at the port of Poole, in Great\r\nBritain, and such parts within the allegiance of His Britannic Majesty\r\nas shall be nearer thereto than to the residence of any other consul or\r\nvice-consul of the United States within the same allegiance.\r\n\r\nI also nominate James Yard, of Pennsylvania, to be consul for the United\r\nStates in the island of Santa Cruz and such other parts within the\r\nallegiance of His Danish Majesty as shall be nearer thereto than to the\r\nresidence of any other consul or vice-consul of the United States within\r\nthe same allegiance.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 4, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe act for the admission of the State of Vermont into this Union having\r\nfixed on this as the day of its admission, it was thought that this\r\nwould also be the first day on which any officer of the Union might\r\nlegally perform any act of authority relating to that State. I therefore\r\nrequired your attendance to receive nominations of the several officers\r\nnecessary to put the Federal Government into motion in that State.[1]\r\n\r\nFor this purpose I nominate Nathaniel Chipman to be judge of the\r\ndistrict of Vermont; Stephen Jacobs to be attorney for the United\r\nStates in the district of Vermont; Lewis R. Morris to be marshal of\r\nthe district of Vermont, and Stephen Keyes to be collector of the port\r\nof Allburgh, in the State of Vermont.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 4, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nPursuant to the powers vested in me by the act entitled \"An act\r\nrepealing after the last day of June next the duties heretofore laid\r\nupon distilled spirits imported from abroad and laying others in their\r\nstead, and also upon spirits distilled within the United States, and for\r\nappropriating the same,\" I have thought fit to divide the United States\r\ninto the following districts, namely:\r\n\r\nThe district of New Hampshire, to consist of the State of New Hampshire;\r\nthe district of Massachusetts, to consist of the State of Massachusetts;\r\nthe district of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, to consist of\r\nthe State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations; the district of\r\nConnecticut, to consist of the State of Connecticut; the district of\r\nVermont, to consist of the State of Vermont; the district of New York,\r\nto consist of the State of New York; the district of New Jersey, to\r\nconsist of the State of New Jersey; the district of Pennsylvania, to\r\nconsist of the State of Pennsylvania; the district of Delaware, to\r\nconsist of the State of Delaware; the district of Maryland, to consist\r\nof the State of Maryland; the district of Virginia, to consist of the\r\nState of Virginia; the district of North Carolina, to consist of the\r\nState of North Carolina; the district of South Carolina, to consist of\r\nthe State of South Carolina; and the district of Georgia, to consist\r\nof the State of Georgia.\r\n\r\nAnd I hereby nominate as supervisors of the said districts,\r\nrespectively, the following persons, viz:\r\n\r\nFor the district of New Hampshire, Joshua Wentworth; for the district of\r\nMassachusetts, Nathaniel Gorham; for the district of Rhode Island and\r\nProvidence Plantations, John S.

In tracing their causes you will have remarked with\r\nparticular pleasure the happy effects of that revival of confidence,\r\npublic as well as private, to which the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States have so eminently contributed; and you will have observed\r\nwith no less interest new and decisive proofs of the increasing\r\nreputation and credit of the nation. But you nevertheless can not fail\r\nto derive satisfaction from the confirmation of these circumstances\r\nwhich will be disclosed in the several official communications that\r\nwill be made to you in the course of your deliberations.\r\n\r\nThe rapid subscriptions to the Bank of the United States, which\r\ncompleted the sum allowed to be subscribed in a single day, is among\r\nthe striking and pleasing evidences which present themselves, not only\r\nof confidence in the Government, but of resource in the community.\r\n\r\nIn the interval of your recess due attention has been paid to the\r\nexecution of the different objects which were specially provided for\r\nby the laws and resolutions of the last session.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important of these is the defense and security of the\r\nWestern frontiers. To accomplish it on the most humane principles was\r\na primary wish.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, at the same time that treaties have been provisionally\r\nconcluded and other proper means used to attach the wavering and to\r\nconfirm in their friendship the well-disposed tribes of Indians,\r\neffectual measures have been adopted to make those of a hostile\r\ndescription sensible that a pacification was desired upon terms of\r\nmoderation and justice.\r\n\r\nThose measures having proved unsuccessful, it became necessary to\r\nconvince the refractory of the power of the United States to punish\r\ntheir depredations. Offensive operations have therefore been directed,\r\nto be conducted, however, as consistently as possible with the dictates\r\nof humanity. Some of these have been crowned with full success and\r\nothers are yet depending. The expeditions which have been completed were\r\ncarried on under the authority and at the expense of the United States\r\nby the militia of Kentucky, whose enterprise, intrepidity, and good\r\nconduct are entitled to peculiar commendation.\r\n\r\nOvertures of peace are still continued to the deluded tribes, and\r\nconsiderable numbers of individuals belonging to them have lately\r\nrenounced all further opposition, removed from their former situations,\r\nand placed themselves under the immediate protection of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt is sincerely to be desired that all need of coercion in future may\r\ncease and that an intimate intercourse may succeed, calculated to\r\nadvance the happiness of the Indians and to attach them firmly to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIn order to this it seems necessary--\r\n\r\nThat they should experience the benefits of an impartial dispensation\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\nThat the mode of alienating their lands, the main source of discontent\r\nand war, should be so defined and regulated as to obviate imposition and\r\nas far as may be practicable controversy concerning the reality and\r\nextent of the alienations which are made.\r\n\r\nThat commerce with them should be promoted under regulations tending\r\nto secure an equitable deportment toward them, and that such rational\r\nexperiments should be made for imparting to them the blessings of\r\ncivilization as may from time to time suit their condition.\r\n\r\nThat the Executive of the United States should be enabled to employ the\r\nmeans to which the Indians have been long accustomed for uniting their\r\nimmediate interests with the preservation of peace.\r\n\r\nAnd that efficacious provision should be made for inflicting adequate\r\npenalties upon all those who, by violating their rights, shall infringe\r\nthe treaties and endanger the peace of the Union.\r\n\r\nA system corresponding with the mild principles of religion and\r\nphilanthropy toward an unenlightened race of men, whose happiness\r\nmaterially depends on the conduct of the United States, would be as\r\nhonorable to the national character as conformable to the dictates of\r\nsound policy.\r\n\r\nThe powers specially vested in me by the act laying certain duties on\r\ndistilled spirits; which respect the subdivisions of the districts\r\ninto surveys, the appointment of officers, and the assignment of\r\ncompensations, have likewise been carried into effect. In a matter\r\nin which both materials and experience were wanting to guide the\r\ncalculation it will be readily conceived that there must have been\r\ndifficulty in such an adjustment of the rates of compensation as would\r\nconciliate a reasonable competency with a proper regard to the limits\r\nprescribed by the law. It is hoped that the circumspection which has\r\nbeen used will be found in the result to have secured the last of the\r\ntwo objects; but it is probable that with a view to the first in some\r\ninstances a revision of the provision will be found advisable.\r\n\r\nThe impressions with which this law has been received by the community\r\nhave been upon the whole such as were to be expected among enlightened\r\nand well-disposed citizens from the propriety and necessity of the\r\nmeasure. The novelty, however, of the tax in a considerable part of the\r\nUnited States and a misconception of some of its provisions have given\r\noccasion in particular places to some degree of discontent; but it is\r\nsatisfactory to know that this disposition yields to proper explanations\r\nand more just apprehensions of the true nature of the law, and I\r\nentertain a full confidence that it will in all give way to motives\r\nwhich arise out of a just sense of duty and a virtuous regard to the\r\npublic welfare.\r\n\r\nIf there are any circumstances in the law which consistently with\r\nits main design may be so varied as to remove any well-intentioned\r\nobjections that may happen to exist, it will consist with a wise\r\nmoderation to make the proper variations. It is desirable on all\r\noccasions to unite with a steady and firm adherence to constitutional\r\nand necessary acts of Government the fullest evidence of a disposition\r\nas far as may be practicable to consult the wishes of every part of the\r\ncommunity and to lay the foundations of the public administration in\r\nthe affections of the people.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the authority contained in the several acts on that subject,\r\na district of 10 miles square for the permanent seat of the Government\r\nof the United States has been fixed and announced by proclamation, which\r\ndistrict will comprehend lands on both sides of the river Potomac and\r\nthe towns of Alexandria and Georgetown. A city has also been laid out\r\nagreeably to a plan which will be placed before Congress, and as there\r\nis a prospect, favored by the rate of sales which have already taken\r\nplace, of ample funds for carrying on the necessary public buildings,\r\nthere is every expectation of their due progress.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the census of the inhabitants, for which provision was\r\nmade by law, has been duly notified (excepting one instance in which the\r\nreturn has been informal, and another in which it has been omitted or\r\nmiscarried), and the returns of the officers who were charged with\r\nthis duty, which will be laid before you, will give you the pleasing\r\nassurance that the present population of the United States borders on\r\n4,000,000 persons.\r\n\r\nIt is proper also to inform you that a further loan of 2,500,000 florins\r\nhas been completed in Holland, the terms of which are similar to those\r\nof the one last announced, except as to a small reduction of charges.\r\nAnother, on like terms, for 6,000,000 florins, had been set on foot\r\nunder circumstances that assured an immediate completion.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nTwo treaties which have been provisionally concluded with the Cherokees\r\nand Six Nations of Indians will be laid before you for your\r\nconsideration and ratification.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the discharge of your legislative trust you must\r\nanticipate with pleasure that many of the difficulties necessarily\r\nincident to the first arrangements of a new government for an extensive\r\ncountry have been happily surmounted by the zealous and judicious\r\nexertions of your predecessors in cooperation with the other branch of\r\nthe Legislature. The important objects which remain to be accomplished\r\nwill, I am persuaded, be conducted upon principles equally comprehensive\r\nand equally well calculated for the advancement of the general weal.\r\n\r\nThe time limited for receiving subscriptions to the loans proposed by\r\nthe act making provision for the debt of the United States having\r\nexpired, statements from the proper department will as soon as possible\r\napprise you of the exact result. Enough, however, is known already to\r\nafford an assurance that the views of that act have been substantially\r\nfulfilled. The subscription in the domestic debt of the United States\r\nhas embraced by far the greatest proportion of that debt, affording at\r\nthe same time proof of the general satisfaction of the public creditors\r\nwith the system which has been proposed to their acceptance and of the\r\nspirit of accommodation to the convenience of the Government with which\r\nthey are actuated. The subscriptions in the debts of the respective\r\nStates as far as the provisions of the law have permitted may be said to\r\nbe yet more general. The part of the debt of the United States which\r\nremains unsubscribed will naturally engage your further deliberations.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly pleasing to me to be able to announce to you that the\r\nrevenues which have been established promise to be adequate to their\r\nobjects, and may be permitted, if no unforeseen exigency occurs, to\r\nsupersede for the present the necessity of any new burthens upon our\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nAn object which will claim your early attention is a provision for the\r\ncurrent service of the ensuing year, together with such ascertained\r\ndemands upon the Treasury as require to be immediately discharged,\r\nand such casualties as may have arisen in the execution of the public\r\nbusiness, for which no specific appropriation may have yet been made;\r\nof all which a proper estimate will be laid before you.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI shall content myself with a general reference to former communications\r\nfor several objects upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto\r\npostponed any definitive resolution. Their importance will recall them\r\nto your attention, and I trust that the progress already made in the\r\nmost arduous arrangements of the Government will afford you leisure to\r\nresume them with advantage.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some of them of which I can not forbear a more\r\nparticular mention. These are the militia, the post-office and\r\npost-roads, the mint, weights and measures, a provision for the sale\r\nof the vacant lands of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first is certainly an object of primary importance whether viewed in\r\nreference to the national security to the satisfaction of the community\r\nor to the preservation of order. In connection with this the\r\nestablishment of competent magazines and arsenals and the fortification\r\nof such places as are peculiarly important and vulnerable naturally\r\npresent themselves to consideration. The safety of the United States\r\nunder divine protection ought to rest on the basis of systematic and\r\nsolid arrangements, exposed as little as possible to the hazards of\r\nfortuitous circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the post-office and post-roads on a plan sufficiently\r\nliberal and comprehensive, as they respect the expedition, safety, and\r\nfacility of communication, is increased by their instrumentality in\r\ndiffusing a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the Government,\r\nwhich, while it contributes to the security of the people, serves\r\nalso to guard them against the effects of misrepresentation and\r\nmisconception. The establishment of additional cross posts, especially\r\nto some of the important points in the Western and Northern parts of\r\nthe Union, can not fail to be of material utility.\r\n\r\nThe disorders in the existing currency, and especially the scarcity\r\nof small change, a scarcity so peculiarly distressing to the poorer\r\nclasses, strongly recommend the carrying into immediate effect the\r\nresolution already entered into concerning the establishment of a mint.\r\nMeasures have been taken pursuant to that resolution for procuring some\r\nof the most necessary artists, together with the requisite apparatus.\r\n\r\nAn uniformity in the weights and measures of the country is among the\r\nimportant objects submitted to you by the Constitution, and if it can be\r\nderived from a standard at once invariable and universal, must be no\r\nless honorable to the public councils than conducive to the public\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nA provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States is\r\nparticularly urged, among other reasons, by the important considerations\r\nthat they are pledged as a fund for reimbursing the public debt;\r\nthat if timely and judiciously applied they may save the necessity of\r\nburthening our citizens with new taxes for the extinguishment of the\r\nprincipal; and that being free to discharge the principal but in a\r\nlimited proportion, no opportunity ought to be lost for availing the\r\npublic of its right.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The Senate of the United States have received with the highest\r\nsatisfaction the assurances of public prosperity contained in your\r\nspeech to both Houses. The multiplied blessings of Providence have not\r\nescaped our notice or failed to excite our gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe benefits which flow from the restoration of public and private\r\nconfidence are conspicuous and important, and the pleasure with which\r\nwe contemplate them is heightened by your assurance of those further\r\ncommunications which shall confirm their existence and indicate their\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nWhile we rejoice in the success of those military operations which have\r\nbeen directed against the hostile Indians, we lament with you the\r\nnecessity that has produced them, and we participate the hope that the\r\npresent prospect of a general peace on terms of moderation and justice\r\nmay be wrought into complete and permanent effect, and that the measures\r\nof Government may equally embrace the security of our frontiers and\r\nthe general interests of humanity, our solicitude to obtain which will\r\ninsure our zealous attention to an object so warmly espoused by the\r\nprinciples of benevolence and so highly interesting to the honor and\r\nwelfare of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe several subjects which you have particularly recommended and those\r\nwhich remain of former sessions will engage our early consideration.\r\nWe are encouraged to prosecute them with alacrity and steadiness by\r\nthe belief that they will interest no passion but that for the general\r\nwelfare, by the assurance of concert, and by a view of those arduous\r\nand important arrangements which have been already accomplished.\r\n\r\nWe observe, sir, the constancy and activity of your zeal for the public\r\ngood. The example will animate our efforts to promote the happiness of\r\nour country.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 28, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: This manifestation of your zeal for the honor and the\r\nhappiness of our country derives its full value from the share which\r\nyour deliberations have already had in promoting both.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the favorable sentiments with which you view the part I\r\nhave borne in the arduous trust committed to the Government of the\r\nUnited States, and desire you to be assured that all my zeal will\r\ncontinue to second those further efforts for the public good which are\r\ninsured by the spirit in which you are entering on the present session.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 31, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: In receiving your address at the opening of the present session\r\nthe House of Representatives have taken an ample share in the feelings\r\ninspired by the actual prosperity and flattering prospects of our\r\ncountry, and whilst with becoming gratitude to Heaven we ascribe this\r\nhappiness to the true source from which it flows, we behold with an\r\nanimating pleasure the degree in which the Constitution and laws of\r\nthe United States have been instrumental in dispensing it.\r\n\r\nIt yields us particular satisfaction to learn the success with which the\r\ndifferent important measures of the Government have proceeded, as well\r\nthose specially provided for at the last session as those of preceding\r\ndate. The safety of our Western frontier, in which the lives and repose\r\nof so many of our fellow-citizens are involved, being peculiarly\r\ninteresting, your communications on that subject are proportionally\r\ngrateful to us. The gallantry and good conduct of the militia, whose\r\nservices were called for, is an honorable confirmation of the efficacy\r\nof that precious resource of a free state, and we anxiously wish that\r\nthe consequences of their successful enterprises and of the other\r\nproceedings to which you have referred may leave the United States free\r\nto pursue the most benevolent policy toward the unhappy and deluded race\r\nof people in our neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the population of the United States, determined\r\nby the returns of the census, is a source of the most pleasing\r\nreflections whether it be viewed in relation to our national safety\r\nand respectability or as a proof of that felicity in the situation of\r\nour country which favors so unexampled a rapidity in its growth. Nor\r\nought any to be insensible to the additional motive suggested by this\r\nimportant fact to perpetuate the free Government established, with a\r\nwise administration of it, to a portion of the earth which promises such\r\nan increase of the number which is to enjoy those blessings within the\r\nlimits of the United States.\r\n\r\nWe shall proceed with all the respect due to your patriotic\r\nrecommendations and with a deep sense of the trust committed to us by\r\nour fellow-citizens to take into consideration the various and important\r\nmatters falling within the present session; and in discussing and\r\ndeciding each we shall feel every disposition whilst we are pursuing\r\nthe public welfare, which must be the supreme object with all our\r\nconstituents, to accommodate as far as possible the means of attaining\r\nit to the sentiments and wishes of every part of them.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 27, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: The pleasure I derive from an assurance of your attention to\r\nthe objects I have recommended to you is doubled by your concurrence in\r\nthe testimony I have borne to the prosperous condition of our public\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nRelying on the sanctions of your enlightened judgment and on your\r\npatriotic aid, I shall be the more encouraged in all my endeavors for\r\nthe public weal, and particularly in those which may be required on my\r\npart for executing the salutary measures I anticipate from your present\r\ndeliberations.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 28, 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _October 26, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you copies of the following acts, which have been\r\ntransmitted to me during the recess of Congress, viz:\r\n\r\nAn act passed by the legislature of New Hampshire for ceding to the\r\nUnited States the fort and light-house belonging to the said State.\r\n\r\nAn act of the legislature of Pennsylvania ratifying on behalf of said\r\nState the first article of amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates as proposed by Congress; and\r\n\r\nAn act of the legislature of North Carolina granting the use of the\r\njails within that State to the United States.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _October 26, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI have directed the Secretary of War to lay before you for your\r\nconsideration all the papers relative to the late negotiations with\r\nthe Cherokee Indians, and the treaty concluded with that tribe on the\r\n2d day of July last by the superintendent of the southern district,\r\nand I request your advice whether I shall ratify the same.\r\n\r\nI also lay before you the instructions to Colonel Pickering and his\r\nconferences with the Six Nations of Indians. These conferences were for\r\nthe purpose of conciliation, and at a critical period, to withdraw those\r\nIndians to a greater distance from the theater of war, in order to\r\nprevent their being involved therein.\r\n\r\nIt might not have been necessary to have requested your opinion on\r\nthis business had not the commissioner, with good intentions, but\r\nincautiously, made certain ratifications of lands unauthorized by\r\nhis instructions and unsupported by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt therefore became necessary to disavow the transaction explicitly in a\r\nletter written by my orders to the governor of New York on the 17th of\r\nAugust last.\r\n\r\nThe speeches to the Complanter and other Seneca chiefs, the instructions\r\nto Colonel Proctor, and his report, and other messages and directions\r\nare laid before you for your information and as evidences that all\r\nproper lenient measures preceded the exercise of coercion.\r\n\r\nThe letters to the chief of the Creeks are also laid before you, to\r\nevince that the requisite steps have been taken to produce a full\r\ncompliance with the treaty made with that nation on the 7th of\r\nAugust, 1790.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _October 27, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a copy of a letter and of sundry documents which I have\r\nreceived from the governor of Pennsylvania, respecting certain persons\r\nwho are said to have fled from justice out of the State of Pennsylvania\r\ninto that of Virginia, together with a report of the Attorney-General of\r\nthe United States upon the same subject.\r\n\r\nI have received from the governor of North Carolina a copy of an act of\r\nthe general assembly of that State, authorizing him to convey to the\r\nUnited States the right and jurisdiction of the said State over 1 acre\r\nof land in Occacock Island and 10 acres on the Cape Island, within the\r\nsaid State, for the purpose of erecting light-houses thereon, together\r\nwith the deed of the governor in pursuance thereof and the original\r\nconveyances made to the State by the individual proprietors, which\r\noriginal conveyances contain conditions that the light-house on Occacock\r\nshall be built before the 1st day of January, 1801, and that on the Cape\r\nIsland before the 8th day of October, 1800. And I have caused these\r\nseveral papers to be deposited in the office of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nA statement of the returns of the enumeration of the inhabitants of\r\nthe United States which have been received will at this time be laid\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _October 27, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed the Secretary of War to lay before you, for your\r\ninformation, the reports of Brigadier-General Scott and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Commandant Wilkinson, the officers who commanded the\r\ntwo expeditions against the Wabash Indians in the months of June and\r\nAugust last, together with the instructions by virtue of which the said\r\nexpeditions were undertaken. When the operations now depending shall be\r\nterminated, the reports relative thereto shall also be laid before you.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _October 31, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI send you herewith the arrangement which has been made by me, pursuant\r\nto the act entitled \"An act repealing after the last day of June next\r\nthe duties heretofore laid upon distilled spirits imported from abroad\r\nand laying others in their stead, and also upon spirits distilled within\r\nthe United States, and for appropriating the same,\" in respect to the\r\nsubdivision of the several districts created by the said act into\r\nsurveys of inspection, the appointment of officers for the same, and\r\nthe assignment of compensations.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 1, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI received yesterday from the judge of the district of South Carolina a\r\nletter, inclosing the presentments of the grand jury to him, and stating\r\nthe causes which have prevented the return of the census from that\r\ndistrict, copies of which are now laid before you.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 10, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe resolution passed at the last session of Congress, requesting the\r\nPresident of the United States to cause an estimate to be laid before\r\nCongress at their next session of the quantity and situation of the\r\nlands not claimed by the Indians nor granted to nor claimed by any of\r\nthe citizens of the United States within the territory ceded to the\r\nUnited States by the State of North Carolina and within the territory of\r\nthe United States northwest of the river Ohio, has been referred to the\r\nSecretary of State, a copy of whose report on that subject I now lay\r\nbefore you, together with the copy of a letter accompanying it.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 11, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received from the governor of Virginia a resolution of the\r\ngeneral assembly of that Commonwealth, ratifying the first article of\r\nthe amendments proposed by Congress to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, a copy of which and of the letter accompanying it I now lay\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nSundry papers relating to the purchase by Judge Symmes of the lands on\r\nthe Great Miami having been communicated to me, I have thought it proper\r\nto lay the same before you for your information on that subject.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 12, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt is with great concern that I communicate to you the information\r\nreceived from Major-General St. Clair of the misfortune which has\r\nbefallen the troops under his command.\r\n\r\nAlthough the national loss is considerable according to the scale of the\r\nevent, yet it may be repaired without great difficulty, excepting as to\r\nthe brave men who have fallen on the occasion, and who are a subject of\r\npublic as well as private regret.\r\n\r\nA further communication will shortly be made of all such matters as\r\nshall be necessary to enable the Legislature to judge of the future\r\nmeasures which it may be proper to pursue.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 13, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI place before you the plan of a city that has been laid out within the\r\ndistrict of 10 miles square, which was fixed upon for the permanent seat\r\nof the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 20, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you the copy of a letter which I have received from the\r\ngovernor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and of sundry documents\r\nwhich accompanied it, relative to a contract for the purchase of a\r\ncertain tract of land bounding on Lake Erie, together with a copy of\r\na report of the Secretary of State on the same subject.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 30, 1791_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a copy of the ratification by the Commonwealth of\r\nVirginia of the articles of amendment proposed by Congress to the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and a copy of a letter which\r\naccompanied said ratification from the governor of Virginia.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 11, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you the following report, which has been made to me by the\r\nSecretary of State:\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 22, 1791.\r\n\r\n  The Secretary of State reports to the President of the United States\r\n  that one of the commissioners of Spain, in the name of both, has lately\r\n  communicated to him verbally, by order of his Court, that His Catholic\r\n  Majesty, apprised of our solicitude to have some arrangements made\r\n  respecting our free navigation of the river Mississippi and the use\r\n  of a port thereon, is ready to enter into treaty thereon at Madrid.\r\n\r\n  The Secretary of State is of opinion that this overture should be\r\n  attended to without delay, and that the proposal of treating at Madrid,\r\n  though not what might have been desired, should yet be accepted, and a\r\n  commission plenipotentiary made out for the purpose.\r\n\r\n  That Mr. Carmichael, the present chargé d'affaires of the United States\r\n  at Madrid, from the local acquaintance which he must have acquired with\r\n  persons and circumstances, would be an useful and proper member of the\r\n  commission, but that it would be useful also to join with him some\r\n  person more particularly acquainted with the circumstances of the\r\n  navigation to be treated of.\r\n\r\n  That the fund appropriated by the act providing the means of\r\n  intercourse between the United States and foreign nations will\r\n  insufficiently furnish the ordinary and regular demands on it, and is\r\n  consequently inadequate to the mission of an additional commissioner\r\n  express from hence.\r\n\r\n  That therefore it will be advisable on this account, as well as for\r\n  the sake of dispatch, to constitute some one of the ministers of the\r\n  United States in Europe, jointly with Mr. Carmichael, commissioners\r\n  plenipotentiary for the special purpose of negotiating and concluding\r\n  with any person or persons duly authorized by His Catholic Majesty a\r\n  convention or treaty for the free navigation of the river Mississippi\r\n  by the citizens of the United States under such accommodations with\r\n  respect to a port and other circumstances as may render the said\r\n  navigation practicable, useful, and free from dispute, saving to the\r\n  President and Senate their respective rights as to the ratification\r\n  of the same, and that the said negotiation be at Madrid, or such\r\n  other place in Spain as shall be desired by His Catholic Majesty.\r\n\r\nTH. JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the communication from the Court of Spain, as stated\r\nin the preceding report, I nominate William Carmichael, present chargé\r\nd'affaires of the United States at Madrid, and William Short, present\r\nchargé d'affaires of the United States at Paris, to be commissioners\r\nplenipotentiary for negotiating and concluding with any person or\r\npersons who shall be duly authorized by His Catholic Majesty a\r\nconvention or treaty concerning the navigation of the river Mississippi\r\nby the citizens of the United States, saving to the President and\r\nSenate their respective rights as to the ratification of the same.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 11, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you, in confidence, two reports, made to me by the\r\nSecretary for the Department of War, relatively to the present state\r\nof affairs on the Western frontiers of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn these reports the causes of the present war with the Indians, the\r\nmeasures taken by the Executive to terminate it amicably, and the\r\nmilitary preparations for the late campaign are stated and explained,\r\nand also a plan suggested of such further measures on the occasion as\r\nappear just and expedient.\r\n\r\nI am persuaded, gentlemen, that you will take this important subject\r\ninto your immediate and serious consideration, and that the result of\r\nyour deliberations will be the adoption of such wise and efficient\r\nmeasures as will reflect honor on our national councils and promote\r\nthe welfare of our country.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 18, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a copy of an exemplified copy of an act of the\r\nlegislature of Vermont, ratifying on behalf of that State the articles\r\nof amendment proposed by Congress to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates together with a copy of a letter which accompanied said\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 18, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you the communications of a deputation from the Cherokee\r\nNation of Indians now in this city, and I request your advice whether an\r\nadditional article shall be made to the Cherokee treaty to the following\r\neffect, to wit:\r\n\r\nThat the sum to be paid annually by the United States to the Cherokee\r\nNation of Indians in consideration of the relinquishment of lands as\r\nstated in the treaty made with them on the 2d day of July, 1791, shall\r\nbe $1,500 instead of $1,000 mentioned in the said treaty.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 23, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHaving received from the governor of Virginia a letter, inclosing a\r\nresolution of the general assembly of that State and a report of a\r\ncommittee of the House of Delegates respecting certain lands located by\r\nthe officers and soldiers of the Virginia line under the laws of that\r\nState, and since ceded to the Chickasaw Indians, I lay copies of the\r\nsame before you, together with a report of the Secretary of State on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 8, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAn article of expense having occurred in the Department of Foreign\r\nAffairs for which no provision has been made by law, I lay before you a\r\nletter from the Secretary of State explaining the same, in order that\r\nyou may do thereon what you shall find to be right.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 3, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a copy of a return of the number of inhabitants in the\r\ndistrict of South Carolina as made to me by the marshal thereof, and a\r\ncopy of a letter which accompanied said return.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 5, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nKnowing the friendly interest you take in whatever may promote the\r\nhappiness and prosperity of the French nation, it is with pleasure that\r\nI lay before you the translation of a letter which I have received from\r\nHis Most Christian Majesty, announcing to the United States of America\r\nhis acceptance of the constitution presented to him by his nation.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Very Dear Great Friends and Allies_:\r\n\r\nWe make it our duty to inform you that we have accepted the constitution\r\nwhich has been presented to us in the name of the nation, and according\r\nto which France will be henceforth governed.\r\n\r\nWe do not doubt that you take an interest in an event so important\r\nto our Kingdom and to us, and it is with real pleasure we take this\r\noccasion to renew to you assurances of the sincere friendship we bear\r\nyou. Whereupon we pray God to have you, very dear great friends and\r\nallies, in His just and holy keeping.\r\n\r\nWritten at Paris the 19th of September, 1791.\r\n\r\nYour good friend and ally,\r\n\r\nLOUIS.\r\n\r\nMONTMORIN.\r\n\r\nThe UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 6, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you the following report, which has been submitted to me by\r\nthe Secretary of State:\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 10, 1792.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State having received information that the merchants\r\nand merchandise of the United States are subject in Copenhagen and other\r\nports of Denmark to considerable extra duties, from which they might\r\nprobably be relieved by the presence of a consul there--\r\n\r\nReports to the President of the United States that it would be expedient\r\nto name a consul to be resident in the port of Copenhagen; that he has\r\nnot been able to find that there is any citizen of the United States\r\nresiding there; that there is a certain Hans Rudolph Saaby, a Danish\r\nsubject and merchant of that place, of good character, of wealth and\r\ndistinction, and well qualified and disposed to act there for the United\r\nStates, who would probably accept the commission of consul; but that\r\nthat of vice-consul, hitherto given by the President to foreigners in\r\nports where there was no proper American citizen, would probably not be\r\naccepted because in this, as in some other ports of Europe, usage has\r\nestablished it as a subordinate grade.\r\n\r\nAnd that he is therefore of the opinion that the said Hans Rudolph Saaby\r\nshould be nominated consul of the United States of America for the port\r\nof Copenhagen and such other places within the allegiance of His Danish\r\nMajesty as shall be nearer to the said port than to the residence of\r\nany other consul or vice-consul of the United States within the same\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a view to relieve the merchants and merchandise of the United\r\nStates from the extra duties to which they are or may be subjected in\r\nthe ports of Denmark, I have thought it for the interest of the United\r\nStates that a consul be appointed to reside at Copenhagen. I therefore\r\nnominate Hans Rudolph Saaby, a Danish subject and merchant of\r\nCopenhagen, to be consul for the United States of America at the port\r\nof Copenhagen and for such other places within the allegiance of His\r\nDanish Majesty as shall be nearer to the said port than to the residence\r\nof any other consul or vice-consul of the United States within the same\r\nallegiance.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 7, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI submit to your consideration the report of the Secretary of State,\r\nwhich accompanies this, stating the reasons for extending the\r\nnegotiation proposed at Madrid to the subject of commerce, and\r\nexplaining, under the form of instructions to the commissioners lately\r\nappointed to that Court, the principles on which commercial arrangements\r\nwith Spain might, if desired on her part, be acceded to on ours; and\r\nI have to request your decision whether you will advise and consent to\r\nthe extension of the powers of the commissioners as proposed, and to\r\nthe ratification of a treaty which shall conform to those instructions\r\nshould they enter into such a one with that Court.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 7, 1792.\r\n\r\n  The Secretary of State having understood from communications with the\r\n  commissioners of His Catholic Majesty, subsequent to that which he\r\n  reported to the President on the 22d of December last, that though they\r\n  considered the navigation of the Mississippi as the principal object\r\n  of negotiation between the two countries, yet it was expected by their\r\n  Court that the conferences would extend to all the matters which were\r\n  under negotiation on the former occasion with Mr. Gardoqui, and\r\n  particularly to some arrangements of commerce, is of opinion that to\r\n  renew the conferences on this subject also, since they desire it, will\r\n  be but friendly and respectful, and can lead to nothing without our\r\n  own consent, and that to refuse it might obstruct the settlement of\r\n  the questions of navigation and boundary; and therefore reports to\r\n  the President of the United States the following observations and\r\n  instructions to the commissioners of the United States appointed to\r\n  negotiate with the Court of Spain a treaty or convention relative to\r\n  the navigation of the Mississippi, which observations and instructions\r\n  he is of opinion should be laid before the Senate of the United States,\r\n  and their decision be desired whether they will advise and consent that\r\n  a treaty be entered into by the commissioners of the United States with\r\n  Spain conformably thereto.\r\n\r\n  After stating to our commissioners the foundation of our rights to\r\n  navigate the Mississippi and to hold our southern boundary at the\r\n  thirty-first degree of latitude, and that each of these is to be a\r\n  sine qua non, it is proposed to add as follows:\r\n\r\n  On the former conferences on the navigation of the Mississippi, Spain\r\n  chose to blend with it the subject of commerce, and accordingly\r\n  specific propositions thereon passed between the negotiators. Her\r\n  object then was to obtain our renunciation of the navigation and to\r\n  hold out commercial arrangements perhaps as a lure to us. Perhaps,\r\n  however, she might then, and may now, really set a value on commercial\r\n  arrangements with us, and may receive them as a consideration for\r\n  accommodating us in the navigation, or may wish for them to have the\r\n  appearance of receiving a consideration. Commercial arrangements, if\r\n  acceptable in themselves, will not be the less so if coupled with\r\n  those relating to navigation and boundary. We have only to take care\r\n  that they be acceptable in themselves.\r\n\r\n  There are two principles which may be proposed as the basis of a\r\n  commercial treaty: First, that of exchanging the privileges of native\r\n  citizens, or, second, those of the most favored nation.\r\n\r\n  First. With the nations holding important possessions in America we\r\n  are ready to exchange the rights of native citizens, provided they\r\n  be extended through the whole possessions of both parties; but the\r\n  propositions of Spain made on the former occasion (a copy of which\r\n  accompanies this) were that we should give their merchants, vessels,\r\n  and productions the privileges of native merchants, vessels, and\r\n  productions through the whole of our possessions, and they give the\r\n  same to ours only in Spain and the Canaries. This is inadmissible,\r\n  because unequal; and as we believe that Spain is not ripe for an\r\n  equal exchange on this basis, we avoid proposing it.\r\n\r\n  Second. Though treaties which merely exchange the rights of the most\r\n  favored nations are not without all inconvenience, yet they have their\r\n  conveniences also. It is an important one that they leave each party\r\n  free to make what internal regulations they please, and to give what\r\n  preferences they find expedient to native merchants, vessels, and\r\n  productions; and as we already have treaties on this basis with\r\n  France, Holland, Sweden, and Prussia, the two former of which are\r\n  perpetual, it will be but small additional embarrassment to extend it\r\n  to Spain. On the contrary, we are sensible it is right to place that\r\n  nation on the most favored footing, whether we have a treaty with them\r\n  or not, and it can do us no harm to secure by treaty a reciprocation\r\n  of the right.\r\n\r\n  Of the four treaties before mentioned, either the French or the\r\n  Prussian might be taken as a model; but it would be useless to\r\n  propose the Prussian, because we have already supposed that Spain\r\n  would never consent to those articles which give to each party\r\n  access to all the dominions of the other; and without this equivalent\r\n  we would not agree to tie our own hands so materially in war as would\r\n  be done by the twenty-third article, which renounces the right of\r\n  fitting out privateers or of capturing merchant vessels. The French\r\n  treaty, therefore, is proposed as the model. In this, however, the\r\n  following changes are to be made:\r\n\r\n  We should be admitted to all the dominions of Spain to which any\r\n  other foreign nation is or may be admitted.\r\n\r\n  Article 5, being an exemption from a particular duty in France,\r\n  will of course be omitted as inapplicable to Spain.\r\n\r\n  Article 8 to be omitted as unnecessary with Morocco, and\r\n  inefficacious and little honorable with any of the Barbary powers;\r\n  but it may furnish occasion to sound Spain on the project of a\r\n  convention of the powers at war with the Barbary States to keep\r\n  up by rotation a constant cruise of a given force on their coasts\r\n  till they shall be compelled to renounce forever and against all\r\n  nations their predatory practices. Perhaps the infidelities of the\r\n  Algerines to their treaty of peace with Spain, though the latter\r\n  does not choose to break openly, may induce her to subsidize _us_\r\n  to cruise against them with a given force.\r\n\r\n  Articles 9 and 10, concerning fisheries, to be omitted as\r\n  inapplicable.\r\n\r\n  Article 11. The first paragraph of this article respecting the\r\n  droit d'aubaine to be omitted, that law being supposed peculiar\r\n  to France.\r\n\r\n  Article 17, giving asylum in the ports of either to the armed vessels\r\n  of the other with the prizes taken from the enemies of that other,\r\n  must be qualified as it is in the nineteenth article of the Prussian\r\n  treaty, as the stipulation in the latter part of the article that\r\n  \"no shelter or refuge shall be given in the ports of the one to such\r\n  as shall have made prize on the subjects of the other of the parties\"\r\n  would forbid us, in case of a war between France and Spain, to give\r\n  shelter in our ports to prizes made by the latter on the former,\r\n  while the first part of the article would oblige us to shelter those\r\n  made by the former on the latter--a very dangerous covenant, and which\r\n  ought never to be repeated in any other instance.\r\n\r\n  Article 29. Consuls should be received at all the ports at which the\r\n  vessels of either party may be received.\r\n\r\n  Article 30, concerning free ports in Europe and America, free ports in\r\n  the Spanish possessions in America, and particularly at The Havannah,\r\n  are more to be desired than expected. It can therefore only be\r\n  recommended to the best endeavors of the commissioners to obtain them.\r\n  It will be something to obtain for our vessels, flour, etc., admission\r\n  to those ports during their pleasure. In like manner, if they could be\r\n  prevailed on to reestablish our right of cutting logwood in the Bay of\r\n  Campeachy on the footing on which it stood before the treaty of 1763,\r\n  it would be desirable and not endanger to us any contest with the\r\n  English, who by the revolution treaty are restrained to the\r\n  southeastern parts of Yucatan.\r\n\r\n  Article 31. The _act_ of ratification on our part may require a\r\n  twelvemonth from the date of the treaty, as the Senate meets regularly\r\n  but once a year; and to return it to Madrid for _exchange_ may require\r\n  four months more.\r\n\r\n  The treaty must not exceed ---- years' duration, except the clauses\r\n  relating to boundary and the navigation of the Mississippi, which must\r\n  be perpetual and final. Indeed, these two subjects had better be in a\r\n  separate instrument.\r\n\r\n  There might have been mentioned a third species of arrangement--that\r\n  of making special agreements on every special subject of commerce,\r\n  and of settling a tariff of duty to be paid on each side on every\r\n  particular article; but this would require in our commissioners a\r\n  very minute knowledge of our commerce, as it is impossible to foresee\r\n  every proposition of this kind which might be brought into discussion\r\n  and to prepare them for it by information and instruction from hence.\r\n  Our commerce, too, is as yet rather in a course of experiment, and\r\n  the channels in which it will ultimately flow are not sufficiently\r\n  known to enable us to provide for it by special agreement; nor\r\n  have the exigencies of our new Government as yet so far developed\r\n  themselves as that we can know to what degree we may or must have\r\n  recourse to commerce for the purposes of revenue. No common\r\n  consideration, therefore, ought to induce us as yet to arrangements\r\n  of this kind. Perhaps nothing should do it with any nation short\r\n  of the privileges of natives in all their possessions, foreign and\r\n  domestic.\r\n\r\n  It were to be wished, indeed, that some positively favorable\r\n  stipulations respecting our grain, flour, and fish could be obtained,\r\n  even on our giving reciprocal advantages to some of the commodities\r\n  of Spain, say her wines and brandies; but,\r\n\r\n  First. If we quit the ground of the _most favored nation_ as to\r\n  certain articles for our convenience, Spain may insist on doing\r\n  the same for other articles for her convenience, and thus our\r\n  commissioners will get themselves on the ground of _a treaty of\r\n  detail_, for which they will not be prepared.\r\n\r\n  Second. If we grant favor to the wines and brandies of Spain, then\r\n  Portugal and France will demand the same; and in order to create an\r\n  equivalent Portugal may lay a duty on our fish and grain, and France\r\n  a prohibition on our whale oils, the removal of which will be proposed\r\n  as an equivalent.\r\n\r\n  Thus much, however, as to grain and flour may be attempted. There has\r\n  not long since been a considerable duty laid on them in Spain. This\r\n  was while a treaty on the subject of commerce was pending between us\r\n  and Spain, as that Court considers the matter. It is not generally\r\n  thought right to change the state of things pending a treaty\r\n  concerning them. On this consideration and on the motive of\r\n  cultivating our friendship, perhaps the commissioners may induce them\r\n  to restore this commodity to the footing on which it was on opening\r\n  the conferences with Mr. Gardoqui, on the 26th day of July, 1785. If\r\n  Spain says, \"Do the same by your tonnage on our vessels,\" the answer\r\n  may be that \"Our foreign tonnage affects Spain very little and other\r\n  nations very much; whereas the duty on flour in Spain affects us very\r\n  much and other nations very little; consequently there would be no\r\n  equality in reciprocal relinquishment, as there had been none in the\r\n  reciprocal innovation; and Spain, by insisting on this, would in fact\r\n  only be aiding the interests of her rival nations, to whom we should\r\n  be forced to extend the same indulgence.\" At the time of opening the\r\n  conferences, too, we had as yet not erected any system, our Government\r\n  itself being not yet erected. Innovation then was unavoidable on our\r\n  part, if it be innovation to establish a system. We did it on fair and\r\n  general ground, on ground favorable to Spain; but they had a system,\r\n  and therefore innovation was avoidable on their part.\r\n\r\n  THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLES PROPOSED BY DON DIEGO GARDOQUI TO BE INSERTED IN THE TREATY\r\nWITH THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nFirst. That all commercial regulations affecting each other shall be\r\nfounded in perfect reciprocity. Spanish merchants shall enjoy all the\r\ncommercial privileges of native merchants in the United States, and\r\nAmerican merchants shall enjoy all the commercial privileges of native\r\nmerchants in the Kingdom of Spain and in the Canaries and other islands\r\nbelonging to and adjacent thereto. The same privileges shall extend to\r\ntheir respective vessels and merchandise consisting of the manufactures\r\nand products of their respective countries.\r\n\r\nSecond. Each party may establish consuls in the countries of the other\r\n(excepting such provinces in Spain into which none have heretofore been\r\nadmitted, viz, Bilboa and Guipusca), with such powers and privileges as\r\nshall be ascertained by a particular convention.\r\n\r\nThird. That the bona fide manufactures and productions of the United\r\nStates (tobacco only excepted, which shall continue under its present\r\nregulation) may be imported in American or Spanish vessels into any\r\nparts of His Majesty's European dominions and islands aforesaid in like\r\nmanner as if they were the productions of Spain, and, on the other hand,\r\nthat the bona fide manufactures and productions of His Majesty's\r\ndominions may be imported into the United States in Spanish or American\r\nvessels in like manner as if they were the manufactures and productions\r\nof the said States. And further, that all such duties and imposts as may\r\nmutually be thought necessary to lay on them by either party shall be\r\nascertained and regulated on principles of exact reciprocity by a\r\ntariff, to be formed by a convention for that purpose, to be negotiated\r\nand made within _one_ year after the exchange of the ratification of\r\nthis treaty; and in the meantime that no other duties or imposts shall\r\nbe exacted from each other's merchants and ships than such as may be\r\npayable by natives in like cases.\r\n\r\nFourth. That inasmuch as the United States, from not having mines of\r\ngold and silver, may often want supplies of specie for a circulating\r\nmedium, His Catholic Majesty, as a proof of his good will, agrees to\r\norder the masts and timber which may from time to time be wanted for his\r\nroyal navy to be purchased and paid for in specie in the United States,\r\nprovided the said masts and timber shall be of equal quality and when\r\nbrought to Spain shall not cost more than the like may there be had for\r\nfrom other countries.\r\n\r\nFifth. It is agreed that the articles commonly inserted in other\r\ntreaties of commerce for mutual and reciprocal convenience shall be\r\ninserted in this, and that this treaty and every article and stipulation\r\ntherein shall continue in full force for ----- years, to be computed\r\nfrom the day of the date hereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 9, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before you a general account rendered by the bankers of the\r\nUnited States at Amsterdam of the payments they had made between the\r\n1st of July, 1790 and 1791, from the fund deposited in their hands for\r\nthe purposes of the act providing the means of intercourse between the\r\nUnited States and foreign nations, and of the balance remaining in their\r\nhands, together with a letter from the Secretary of State on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 20, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe several acts which have been passed relatively to the military\r\nestablishment of the United States and the protection of the\r\nfrontiers do not appear to have made provision for more than one\r\nbrigadier-general. It is incumbent upon me to observe that, with a view\r\nmerely to the organization of the troops designated by those acts,\r\na greater number of officers of that grade would, in my opinion, be\r\nconducive to the good of the public service. But an increase of the\r\nnumber becomes still more desirable in reference to a different\r\norganization which is contemplated, pursuant to the authority vested\r\nin me for that purpose, and which, besides other advantages expected\r\nfrom it, is recommended by considerations of economy. I therefore\r\nrequest that you will be pleased to take this subject into your early\r\nconsideration and to adopt such measures thereon as you shall judge\r\nproper.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 23, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nAt the conferences which Colonel Pickering had with the Five Nations at\r\nthe Painted Post the last year ideas were then held out of introducing\r\namong them some of the primary principles of civilization, in\r\nconsequence of which, as well as more firmly to attach them to the\r\ninterests of the United States, they have been invited to the seat of\r\nthe General Government.\r\n\r\nAs the representation now here is respectable for its character and\r\ninfluence, it is of some importance that the chiefs should be well\r\nsatisfied of the entire good faith and liberality of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn managing the affairs of the Indian tribes generally it appears proper\r\nto teach them to expect annual presents, conditioned on the evidence of\r\ntheir attachment to the interests of the United States. The situation of\r\nthe Five Nations and the present crisis of affairs would seem to render\r\nthe extension of this measure to them highly judicious. I therefore\r\nrequest the advice of the Senate whether an article shall be stipulated\r\nwith the Five Nations to the following purport, to wit:\r\n\r\nThe United States, in order to promote the happiness of the Five Nations\r\nof Indians, will cause to be expended annually the amount of $1,500 in\r\npurchasing for them clothing, domestic animals, and implements of\r\nhusbandry, and for encouraging useful artificers to reside in their\r\nvillages,\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 13, 1792.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have thought it proper to lay before you a communication of the 11th\r\ninstant from the minister plenipotentiary of Great Britain to the\r\nSecretary of State, relative to the commerce of the two countries,\r\ntogether with their explanatory correspondence and the Secretary of\r\nState's letter to me on the subject,\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 16, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a copy of a letter from the judges of the circuit court\r\nof the United States held for the New York district, and of their\r\nopinion and agreement respecting the \"Act to provide for the settlement\r\nof the claims of widows and orphans barred by the limitations heretofore\r\nestablished, and to regulate the claims to invalid pensions.\"\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 21, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you the copy of a letter which I have received from\r\nthe judges of the circuit court of the United States held for the\r\nPennsylvania district relatively to the \"Act to provide for the\r\nsettlement of the claims of widows and orphans barred by the limitations\r\nheretofore established, and to regulate the claims to invalid pensions.\"\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 8, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIf the President of the United States should conclude a convention or\r\ntreaty with the Government of Algiers for the ransom of the thirteen\r\nAmericans in captivity there for a sum not exceeding $40,000, all\r\nexpenses included, will the Senate approve the same? Or is there any,\r\nand what, greater or lesser sum which they would fix on as the limit\r\nbeyond which they would not approve the ransom?\r\n\r\nIf the President of the United States should conclude a treaty with the\r\nGovernment of Algiers for the establishment of peace with them, at an\r\nexpense not exceeding $25,000, paid at the signature, and a like sum to\r\nbe paid annually afterwards during the continuance of the treaty, would\r\nthe Senate approve the same? Or are there any greater or lesser sums\r\nwhich they would fix on as the limits beyond which they would not\r\napprove of such treaty?\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 5, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have maturely considered the act passed by the two Houses entitled\r\n\"An act for an apportionment of Representatives among the several States\r\naccording to the first enumeration,\" and I return it to your House,\r\nwherein it originated, with the following objections:\r\n\r\nFirst. The Constitution has prescribed that Representatives shall be\r\napportioned among the several States according to their respective\r\nnumbers, and there is no one proportion or divisor which, applied to the\r\nrespective numbers of the States, will yield the number and allotment of\r\nRepresentatives proposed by the bill.\r\n\r\nSecond. The Constitution has also provided that the number of\r\nRepresentatives shall not exceed 1 for every 30,000, which restriction\r\nis by the context and by fair and obvious construction to be applied to\r\nthe separate and respective numbers of the States; and the bill has\r\nallotted to eight of the States more than 1 for every 30,000.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n[From Sparks's Washington, Vol. X, p. 532.]\r\n\r\nWhereas certain violent and unwarrantable proceedings have lately taken\r\nplace tending to obstruct the operation of the laws of the United States\r\nfor raising a revenue upon spirits distilled within the same, enacted\r\npursuant to express authority delegated in the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, which proceedings are subversive of good order, contrary\r\nto the duty that every citizen owes to his country and to the laws, and\r\nof a nature dangerous to the very being of a government; and\r\n\r\nWhereas such proceedings are the more unwarrantable by reason of the\r\nmoderation which has been heretofore shown on the part of the Government\r\nand of the disposition which has been manifested by the Legislature (who\r\nalone have authority to suspend the operation of laws) to obviate causes\r\nof objection and to render the laws as acceptable as possible; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is the particular duty of the Executive \"to take care that\r\nthe laws be faithfully executed,\" and not only that duty but the\r\npermanent interests and happiness of the people require that every legal\r\nand necessary step should be pursued as well to prevent such violent and\r\nunwarrantable proceedings as to bring to justice the infractors of the\r\nlaws and secure obedience thereto:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, George Washington, President of the United States, do\r\nby these presents most earnestly admonish and exhort all persons whom it\r\nmay concern to refrain and desist from all unlawful combinations and\r\nproceedings whatsoever having for object or tending to obstruct the\r\noperation of the laws aforesaid, inasmuch as all lawful ways and means\r\nwill be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors\r\nthereof and securing obedience thereto.\r\n\r\nAnd I do moreover charge and require all courts, magistrates, and\r\nofficers whom it may concern, according to the duties of their several\r\noffices, to exert the powers in them respectively vested by law for the\r\npurposes aforesaid, hereby also enjoining and requiring all persons\r\nwhomsoever, as they tender the welfare of their country, the just and\r\ndue authority of Government, and the preservation of the public peace,\r\nto be aiding and assisting therein according to law.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\naffixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone this 15th of September, A.D. 1792, and of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States the seventeenth.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 6, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the\r\npresent occasion that, in felicitating you on a continuance of the\r\nnational prosperity generally, I am not able to add to it information\r\nthat the Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our\r\nNorthwestern frontier have terminated.\r\n\r\nYou will, I am persuaded, learn with no less concern than I\r\ncommunicate it that reiterated endeavors toward effecting a pacification\r\nhave hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering\r\nhostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest.\r\nAn earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier, to stop the\r\nfurther effusion of blood, to arrest the progress of expense, to forward\r\nthe prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts\r\nthrough various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes; in\r\nmaking which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event,\r\nor the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire,\r\nthan the wish to find the object attainable, or if not attainable,\r\nto ascertain unequivocally that such is the case.\r\n\r\nA detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their\r\nconsequences, which will be laid before you, while it will confirm to\r\nyou the want of success thus far, will, I trust, evince that means as\r\nproper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed.\r\nThe issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending, but a favorable\r\none, though not to be despaired of, is not promised by anything that has\r\nyet happened.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable\r\ncitizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A\r\nsanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this\r\ninstance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace.\r\nIt will, I presume, be duly considered whether the occasion does not\r\ncall for an exercise of liberality toward the families of the deceased.\r\n\r\nIt must add to your concern to be informed that, besides the\r\ncontinuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio,\r\nsome threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those\r\nsouth of it.\r\n\r\nA part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chickamaugas, inhabiting\r\nfive villages on the Tennessee River, have long been in the practice of\r\ncommitting depredations on the neighboring settlements.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that the treaty of Holston, made with the Cherokee Nation\r\nin July, 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations;\r\nbut the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamaugas, aided\r\nby some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity, have recently\r\nperpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the\r\nUnited States in that quarter. The information which has been received\r\non this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions\r\nonly have been strictly enjoined and observed.\r\n\r\nIt is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever\r\non the part of the United States or their citizens is even alleged as a\r\npretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made\r\n(pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for\r\nthe alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of\r\npacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be\r\nraised have been recruited, though the number is still incomplete, and\r\npains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the\r\nparticular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations\r\n(besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing toward a\r\npacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to\r\nimmature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard\r\nto the number of troops raised, and some other points which have been\r\nsuggested, will afford more precise information as a guide to the\r\nlegislative consultations, and among other things will enable Congress\r\nto judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may\r\nnot be advisable.\r\n\r\nIn looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be\r\nfound inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive\r\nthat the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to\r\nsupersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the\r\nservice of the ensuing year. This, however, will be better ascertained\r\nin the course of the session, and it is proper to add that the\r\ninformation alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material\r\nextension of the spirit of hostility.\r\n\r\nI can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again\r\nrecommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate\r\nprovision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier\r\nand for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians, without\r\nwhich all pacific plans must prove nugatory. To enable, by competent\r\nrewards, the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among\r\nthem as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and\r\ngood neighborhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan\r\ncould be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes\r\nand for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants\r\nand under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and\r\nextortion, its influence in cementing their interest with ours could\r\nnot but be considerable.\r\n\r\nThe prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated. This would be\r\nstill more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places\r\ncontinue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled\r\nwithin the United States. These impediments have lessened and are\r\nlessening in local extent, and, as applied to the community at large,\r\nthe contentment with the law appears to be progressive.\r\n\r\nBut symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves\r\nin certain quarters, I judged a special interposition on my part proper\r\nand advisable, and under this impression have issued a proclamation\r\nwarning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for\r\ntheir object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in\r\nquestion, and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be\r\nstrictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors\r\nthereof and securing obedience thereto.\r\n\r\nMeasures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders, and\r\nCongress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal\r\nlimits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain\r\nthe just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust I shall count\r\nentirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the\r\nGovernment and upon the zealous support of all good citizens.\r\n\r\nI can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the\r\nsubject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the\r\njudges of the Supreme Court, which will be laid before you, points out\r\nsome of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the\r\nexecution of the laws considerations arise out of the structure of that\r\nsystem which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy. As connected\r\nwith this subject, provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon\r\nprocesses out of the courts of the United States and a supplementary\r\ndefinition of offenses against the Constitution and laws of the Union\r\nand of the punishment for such offenses will, it is presumed, be found\r\nworthy of particular attention.\r\n\r\nObservations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary.\r\nIt would be wise, however, by timely provisions to guard against those\r\nacts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it, and to put\r\nourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations\r\nwhich we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I\r\nparticularly recommend to your consideration the means of preventing\r\nthose aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations, and\r\nother infractions of the law of nations, which, furnishing just subject\r\nof complaint, might endanger our peace with them; and, in general, the\r\nmaintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be\r\npresented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that\r\npurpose, which takes place, if not renewed, at the close of the present\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nIn execution of the authority given by the Legislature measures have\r\nbeen taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the\r\nestablishment of our mint. Others have been employed at home. Provision\r\nhas been made of the requisite buildings, and these are now putting into\r\nproper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also\r\nbeen a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes, the want of small\r\ncoins in circulation calling the first attention to them.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles\r\nof our national coinage, as being essential to their due operation\r\nand to order in our money concerns, will, I doubt not, be resumed and\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nIt is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes\r\nthe post-office operate, in experiment, against the transmission of\r\nnewspapers to distant parts of the country. Should this, upon due\r\ninquiry, be found to be the fact, a full conviction of the importance of\r\nfacilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information\r\nwill, I doubt not, lead to the application of a remedy.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of a constitution for the State of Kentucky has been\r\nnotified to me. The Legislature will share with me in the satisfaction\r\nwhich arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of\r\nthe nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order.\r\n\r\nIt is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication\r\non the subject, and in further execution of the acts severally making\r\nprovision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof, three new\r\nloans have been effected, each for 3,000,000 florins--one at Antwerp, at\r\nthe annual interest of 4-1/2 per cent, with an allowance of 4 per cent\r\nin lieu of all charges, and the other two at Amsterdam, at the annual\r\ninterest of 4 per cent, with an allowance of 5-1/2 per cent in one case\r\nand of 5 per cent in the other in lieu of all charges. The rates of\r\nthese loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are\r\nconfirmations of the high state of our credit abroad.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied,\r\nthe payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers, according to\r\nthe provision made during the last session, has been embraced.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is\r\nnow sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and\r\neffectual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the\r\npublic debt, according to the right which has been reserved to the\r\nGovernment. No measure can be more desirable, whet her viewed with an\r\neye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\nProvision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which\r\nhas been made of the Bank of the United States, pursuant to the eleventh\r\nsection of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public\r\nstipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nAppropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such\r\nextraordinaries as may require provision will demand, and I doubt not\r\nwill engage, your early attention.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI content myself with recalling your attention generally to such\r\nobjects, not particularized in my present, as have been suggested\r\nin my former communications to you.\r\n\r\nVarious temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among\r\nthese, that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes\r\nwill merit particular notice.\r\n\r\nThe results of your common deliberations hitherto will, I trust, be\r\nproductive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents, such\r\nas, by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage, will tend\r\nto strengthen and confirm their attachment to that Constitution of\r\nGovernment upon which, under Divine Providence, materially depend their\r\nunion, their safety, and their happiness.\r\n\r\nStill further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is\r\nnothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful\r\ncultivation of harmony, combined with a due regard to stability,\r\nin the public councils.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nAccept, sir, our grateful acknowledgments for your address at the\r\nopening of the present session. We participate with you in the\r\nsatisfaction arising from the continuance of the general prosperity of\r\nthe nation, but it is not without the most sincere concern that we are\r\ninformed that the reiterated efforts which have been made to establish\r\npeace with the hostile Indians have hitherto failed to accomplish that\r\ndesired object. Hoping that the measures still depending may prove more\r\nsuccessful than those which have preceded them, we shall nevertheless\r\nconcur in every necessary preparation for the alternative, and should\r\nthe Indians on either side of the Ohio persist in their hostilities,\r\nfidelity to the Union, as well as affection for our fellow-citizens on\r\nthe frontiers, will insure our decided cooperation in every measure\r\nwhich shall be deemed requisite for their protection and safety.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that we avow the obligation of the Government to afford\r\nits protection to every part of the Union, we can not refrain from\r\nexpressing our regret that even a small portion of our fellow-citizens\r\nin any quarter of it should have combined to oppose the operation of the\r\nlaw for the collection of duties on spirits distilled within the United\r\nStates, a law repeatedly sanctioned by the authority of the nation, and\r\nat this juncture materially connected with the safety and protection of\r\nthose who oppose it. Should the means already adopted fail in securing\r\nobedience to this law, such further measures as may be thought necessary\r\nto carry the same into complete operation can not fail to receive the\r\napprobation of the Legislature and the support of every patriotic\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nIt yields us particular pleasure to learn that the productiveness of the\r\nrevenue of the present year will probably supersede the necessity of any\r\nadditional tax for the service of the next.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the government of the State of Kentucky being an\r\nevent peculiarly interesting to a part of our fellow-citizens and\r\nconducive to the general order, affords us particular satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWe are happy to learn that the high state of our credit abroad has been\r\nevinced by the terms on which the new loans have been negotiated.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the session we shall proceed to take into consideration\r\nthe several objects which you have been pleased to recommend to our\r\nattention, and keeping in view the importance of union and stability in\r\nthe public councils, we shall labor to render our decisions conducive to\r\nthe safety and happiness of our country.\r\n\r\nWe repeat with pleasure our assurances of confidence in your\r\nAdministration and our ardent wish that your unabated zeal for the\r\npublic good may be rewarded by the durable prosperity of the nation,\r\nand every ingredient of personal happiness.\r\n\r\nJOHN LANGDON,\r\n\r\n_President pro tempore_.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 9, 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nI derive much pleasure, gentlemen, from your very satisfactory address.\r\nThe renewed assurances of your confidence in my Administration and the\r\nexpression of your wish for my personal happiness claim and receive\r\nmy particular acknowledgments. In my future endeavor for the public\r\nwelfare, to which my duty may call me, I shall not cease to count\r\nupon the firm, enlightened, and patriotic support of the Senate.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 9, 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The House of Representatives, who always feel a satisfaction\r\nin meeting you, are much concerned that the occasion for mutual\r\nfelicitation afforded by the circumstances favorable to the national\r\nprosperity should be abated by a continuance of the hostile spirit of\r\nmany of the Indian tribes, and particularly that the reiterated efforts\r\nfor effecting a general pacification with them should have issued in\r\nnew proofs of their persevering enmity and the barbarous sacrifice of\r\ncitizens who, as the messengers of peace, were distinguishing themselves\r\nby their zeal for the public service. In our deliberations on this\r\nimportant department of our affairs we shall be disposed to pursue every\r\nmeasure that may be dictated by the sincerest desire, on one hand, of\r\ncultivating peace and manifesting by every practicable regulation our\r\nbenevolent regard for the welfare of those misguided people, and by the\r\nduty we feel, on the other, to provide effectually for the safety and\r\nprotection of our fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nWhile with regret we learn that symptoms of opposition to the law\r\nimposing duties on spirits distilled within the United States have\r\nmanifested themselves, we reflect with consolation that they are\r\nconfined to a small portion of our fellow-citizens. It is not more\r\nessential to the preservation of true liberty that a government should\r\nbe always ready to listen to the representations of its constituents and\r\nto accommodate its measures to the sentiments and wishes of every part\r\nof them, as far as will consist with the good of the whole, than it is\r\nthat the just authority of the laws should be steadfastly maintained.\r\nUnder this impression every department of the Government and all good\r\ncitizens must approve the measures you have taken and the purpose you\r\nhave formed to execute this part of your trust with firmness and energy;\r\nand be assured, sir, of every constitutional aid and cooperation which\r\nmay become requisite on our part. And we hope that, while the progress\r\nof contentment under the law in question is as obvious as it is\r\nrational, no particular part of the community may be permitted to\r\nwithdraw from the general burthens of the country by a conduct as\r\nirreconcilable to national justice as it is inconsistent with public\r\ndecency.\r\n\r\nThe productive state of the public revenue and the confirmation of the\r\ncredit of the United States abroad, evinced by the loans at Antwerp\r\nand Amsterdam, are communications the more gratifying as they enforce\r\nthe obligation to enter on systematic and effectual arrangements for\r\ndischarging the public debt as fast as the conditions of it will permit,\r\nand we take pleasure in the opportunity to assure you of our entire\r\nconcurrence in the opinion that no measure can be more desirable,\r\nwhether viewed with an eye to the urgent wish of the community or the\r\nintrinsic importance of promoting so happy a change in our situation.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of a constitution for the State of Kentucky is an event\r\non which we join in all the satisfaction you have expressed. It may be\r\nconsidered as particularly interesting since, besides the immediate\r\nbenefits resulting from it, it is another auspicious demonstration of\r\nthe facility and success with which an enlightened people is capable of\r\nproviding, by free and deliberate plans of government, for their own\r\nsafety and happiness.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the law establishing the post-office, as it relates\r\nto the transmission of newspapers, will merit our particular inquiry\r\nand attention, the circulation of political intelligence through these\r\nvehicles being justly reckoned among the surest means of preventing\r\nthe degeneracy of a free government, as well as of recommending every\r\nsalutary public measure to the confidence and cooperation of all\r\nvirtuous citizens.\r\n\r\nThe several other matters which you have communicated and\r\nrecommended will in their order receive the attention due to them,\r\nand our discussions will in all cases, we trust, be guided by a proper\r\nrespect for harmony and stability in the public councils and a desire\r\nto conciliate more and more the attachment of our constituents to the\r\nConstitution, by measures accommodated to the true ends for which it\r\nwas established.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 10, 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: It gives me pleasure to express to you the satisfaction\r\nwhich your address affords me. I feel, as I ought, the approbation you\r\nmanifest of the measures I have taken and the purpose I have formed to\r\nmaintain, pursuant to the trust reposed in me by the Constitution, the\r\nrespect which is due to the laws, and the assurance which you at the\r\nsame time give me of every constitutional aid and cooperation that may\r\nbecome requisite on your part.\r\n\r\nThis is a new proof of that enlightened solicitude for the establishment\r\nand confirmation of public order which, embracing a zealous regard for\r\nthe principles of true liberty, has guided the deliberations of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, a perseverance in which can alone secure,\r\nunder the divine blessing, the real and permanent felicity of our\r\ncommon country.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 12, 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 7, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the law, I now lay before you a statement of the\r\nadministration of the funds appropriated to certain foreign purposes,\r\ntogether with a letter from the Secretary of State explaining the same.\r\n\r\nI also lay before you a copy of a letter and representation from the\r\nChief Justice and associate judges of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, stating the difficulties and inconveniences which attend the\r\ndischarge of their duties according to the present judiciary system.\r\n\r\nA copy of a letter from the judges attending the circuit court of the\r\nUnited States for the North Carolina district in June last, containing\r\ntheir observations on an act, passed during the last session of\r\nCongress, entitled \"An act to provide for the settlement of the claims\r\nof widows and orphans barred by the limitations heretofore established,\r\nand to regulate the claims to invalid pensions;\" and\r\n\r\nA copy of the constitution formed for the State of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 9, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before you a letter from the Secretary of State, covering\r\nthe copy of one from the governor of Virginia, with the several papers\r\ntherein referred to, on the subject of the boundary between that State\r\nand the territory of the United States south of the Ohio. It will remain\r\nwith the Legislature to take such measures as it shall think best for\r\nsettling the said boundary with that State, and at the same time, if it\r\nthinks proper, for extending the settlement to the State of Kentucky,\r\nbetween which and the same territory the boundary is as yet\r\nundetermined.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 22, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI send you herewith the abstract of a supplementary arrangement which\r\nhas been made by me, pursuant to the acts of the 3d day of March, 1791,\r\nand the 8th day of May, 1792, for raising a revenue upon foreign and\r\ndomestic distilled spirits, in respect to the subdivisions and officers\r\nwhich have appeared to me necessary and to the allowances for their\r\nrespective services to the supervisors, inspectors, and other officers\r\nof inspection, together with the estimates of the amount of\r\ncompensations and charges.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 6, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe several measures which have been pursued to induce the hostile\r\nIndian tribes north of the Ohio to enter into a conference or treaty\r\nwith the United States at which all causes of difference might be fully\r\nunderstood and justly and amicably arranged have already been submitted\r\nto both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe papers herewith sent will inform you of the result.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 7, 1792_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you two letters, with their inclosures, from the governor\r\nof the Southwestern territory, and an extract of a letter to him from\r\nthe Department of War.\r\n\r\nThese and a letter of the 9th of October last, which has been already\r\ncommunicated to you, from the same Department to the governor, will shew\r\nin what manner the first section of the act of the last session which\r\nprovides for calling out the militia for the repelling of Indian\r\ninvasions has been executed. It remains to be considered by Congress\r\nwhether in the present situation of the United States it be advisable or\r\nnot to pursue any further or other measures than those which have been\r\nalready adopted. The nature of the subject does of itself call for your\r\nimmediate attention to it, and I must add that upon the result of your\r\ndeliberations the future conduct of the Executive will on this occasion\r\nmaterially depend.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 23, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nSince my last communication to you on the subject of the revenue on\r\ndistilled spirits it has been found necessary, on experience, to revise\r\nand amend the arrangements relative thereto in regard to certain surveys\r\nand the officers thereof in the district of North Carolina, which I have\r\ndone accordingly in the manner following:\r\n\r\nFirst. The several counties of the said district originally and\r\nheretofore contained within the first, second, and third surveys have\r\nbeen allotted into and are now contained in two surveys, one of which\r\n(to be hereafter denominated the first) comprehends the town of\r\nWilmington and the counties of Onslow, New Hanover, Brunswick,\r\nRobertson, Sampson, Craven, Jones, Lenox, Glascow, Johnston, and Wayne,\r\nand the other of which (to be hereafter denominated the second)\r\ncomprehends the counties of Kurrituck, Camden, Pasquotank, Perquimans,\r\nChowan, Gates, Hartford, Tyrrel, Bertie, Carteret, Hyde, Beaufort,\r\nand Pitt.\r\n\r\nSecondly. The several counties of the said district originally and\r\nheretofore contained within the fifth survey of the district aforesaid\r\nhas been allotted into and is contained in two surveys, one of which\r\n(to be hereafter denominated the third) comprehends the counties of\r\nMecklenburg, Rowan, Iredell, Montgomery, Guilford, Rockingham, Stokes,\r\nand Surrey, and the other of which (to be hereafter denominated the\r\nfifth) comprehends the counties of Lincoln, Rutherford, Burke, Buncombe,\r\nand Wilkes.\r\n\r\nThirdly. The duties of the inspector of the revenue in and for the\r\nthird survey as constituted above is to be performed for the present\r\nby the supervisor.\r\n\r\nFourthly. The compensations of the inspector of the revenue for the\r\nfirst survey as above constituted are to be a salary of $250 per annum\r\nand commissions and other emoluments similar to those heretofore allowed\r\nto the inspector of the late first survey as it was originally\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\nFifthly. The compensations of the inspector of the revenue for the\r\nsecond survey as above constituted are to be a salary of $100 per annum\r\nand the commissions and other emoluments heretofore allowed to the\r\ninspector of the late third survey as it was originally constituted.\r\n\r\nSixthly. The compensations of the inspector of the revenue for the fifth\r\nsurvey as above constituted are to be a salary of $120 per annum and the\r\ncommissions and other emoluments similar to those heretofore allowed to\r\nthe inspector of the late fifth survey as it was originally constituted.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 25, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you an official statement of the expenditure to the year\r\n1792 from the sum of $10,000, granted to defray the contingent expenses\r\nof Government by an act passed on the 26th of March, 1790.\r\n\r\nAlso an abstract of a supplementary arrangement made in the district of\r\nNorth Carolina in regard to certain surveys to facilitate the execution\r\nof the law laying a duty on distilled spirits.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 13, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you for your consideration and advice a treaty of peace\r\nand friendship made and concluded on the 27th day of September, 1792,\r\nby Brigadier-General Rufus Putnam, in behalf of the United States, with\r\nthe Wabash and Illinois tribes of Indians, and also the proceedings\r\nattending the said treaty, the explanation of the fourth article\r\nthereof, and a map explanatory of the reservation to the French\r\ninhabitants and the general claim of the said Indians.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I also lay before the Senate the copy of\r\na paper which has been delivered by a man by the name of John Baptiste\r\nMayeé, who has accompanied the Wabash Indians at present in this city.\r\n\r\nIt will appear by the certificate of Brigadier-General Putnam that the\r\nWabash Indians disclaimed the validity of the said paper, excepting a\r\ncertain tract upon the Wabash, as mentioned in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe instructions to Brigadier-General Putnam of the 22d of May, together\r\nwith a letter to him of the 7th of August, 1792, were laid before the\r\nSenate on the 7th of November, 1792.\r\n\r\nAfter the Senate shall have considered this treaty, I request that they\r\nwould give me their advice whether the same shall be ratified and\r\nconfirmed; and if to be ratified and confirmed, whether it would not be\r\nproper, in order to prevent any misconception hereafter of the fourth\r\narticle, to guard in the ratification the exclusive preemption of the\r\nUnited States to the lands of the said Indians.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 18, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before you a report and plat of the territory of the United\r\nStates on the Potomac as given in by the commissioners of that\r\nterritory, together with a letter from the Secretary of State which\r\naccompanied them. These papers, being original, are to be again\r\ndeposited with the records of the Department of State after having\r\nanswered the purpose of your information.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 19, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt has been agreed on the part of the United States that a treaty or\r\nconference shall be held at the ensuing season with the hostile Indians\r\nnorthwest of the Ohio, in order to remove, if possible, all causes of\r\ndifference and to establish a solid peace with them.\r\n\r\nAs the estimates heretofore presented to the House for the current year\r\ndid not contemplate this object, it will be proper that an express\r\nprovision be made by law as well for the general expenses of the treaty\r\nas to establish the compensation to be allowed the commissioners who\r\nshall be appointed for the purpose.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore direct the Secretary of War to lay before you an\r\nestimate of the expenses which may probably attend this measure.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 27, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a copy of an exemplification of an act of the\r\nlegislature of New York ceding to the United States the jurisdiction of\r\ncertain lands on Montauk Point for the purpose mentioned in said act,\r\nand the copy of a letter from the governor of New York to the Secretary\r\nof State, which accompanied said exemplification.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 28, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI was led by a consideration of the qualifications of William Patterson,\r\nof New Jersey, to nominate him an associate justice of the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States. It has since occurred that he was a member of the\r\nSenate when the law creating that office was passed, and that the time\r\nfor which he was elected is not yet expired. I think it my duty,\r\ntherefore, to declare that I deem the nomination to have been null\r\nby the Constitution.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Freneau's National Gazette of December 15, 1792.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nWhereas I have received authentic information that certain lawless and\r\nwicked persons of the western frontier in the State of Georgia did\r\nlately invade, burn, and destroy a town belonging to the Cherokee\r\nNation, although in amity with the United States, and put to death\r\nseveral Indians of that nation; and\r\n\r\nWhereas such outrageous conduct not only violates the rights of\r\nhumanity, but also endangers the public peace, and it highly becomes the\r\nhonor and good faith of the United States to pursue all legal means for\r\nthe punishment of those atrocious offenders:\r\n\r\nI have therefore thought fit to issue this my proclamation, hereby\r\nexhorting all the citizens of the United States and requiring all the\r\nofficers thereof, according to their respective stations, to use their\r\nutmost endeavors to apprehend and bring those offenders to justice.\r\nAnd I do moreover offer a reward of $500 for each and every of the\r\nabove-named persons who shall be so apprehended and brought to justice\r\nand shall be proved to have assumed or exercised any command or\r\nauthority among the perpetrators of the crimes aforesaid at the time\r\nof committing the same.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\naffixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Philadelphia, the 12th day of December, A.D. 1792,\r\nand of the Independence of the United States the seventeenth.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annuals of Congress, Second Congress, 666.]\r\n\r\nMARCH 1, 1793.\r\n\r\n_The President of the United States to the President of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nCertain matters touching the public good requiring that the Senate\r\nshall be convened on Monday, the 4th instant, I have desired their\r\nattendance, as I do yours, by these presents, at the Senate Chamber, in\r\nPhiladelphia, on that day, then and there to receive and deliberate\r\non such communications as shall be made to you on my part.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nIN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA, PA.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens: I am again called upon by the voice of my country to\r\nexecute the functions of its Chief Magistrate. When the occasion proper\r\nfor it shall arrive, I shall endeavor to express the high sense I\r\nentertain of this distinguished honor, and of the confidence which has\r\nbeen reposed in me by the people of united America.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the execution of any official act of the President the\r\nConstitution requires an oath of office. This oath I am now about\r\nto take, and in your presence: That if it shall be found during my\r\nadministration of the Government I have in any instance violated\r\nwillingly or knowingly the injunctions thereof, I may (besides incurring\r\nconstitutional punishment) be subject to the upbraidings of all who are\r\nnow witnesses of the present solemn ceremony.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH ANNUAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, _December 3, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nSince the commencement of the term for which I have been again\r\ncalled into office no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to my\r\nfellow-citizens at large the deep and respectful sense which I feel of\r\nthe renewed testimony of public approbation. While on the one hand it\r\nawakened my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate partiality\r\nwith which I have been honored by my country, on the other it could\r\nnot prevent an earnest wish for that retirement from which no private\r\nconsideration should ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief\r\nthat my conduct would be estimated according to its real motives, and\r\nthat the people, and the authorities derived from them, would support\r\nexertions having nothing personal for their object, I have obeyed the\r\nsuffrage which commanded me to resume the Executive power; and I humbly\r\nimplore that Being on whose will the fate of nations depends to crown\r\nwith success our mutual endeavors for the general happiness.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the\r\nUnited States have the most extensive relations there was reason to\r\napprehend that our intercourse with them might be interrupted and our\r\ndisposition for peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often\r\nentertained by belligerent nations. It seemed, therefore, to be my duty\r\nto admonish our citizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and\r\nof hostile acts to any of the parties, and to obtain by a declaration of\r\nthe existing legal state of things an easier admission of our right to\r\nthe immunities belonging to our situation. Under these impressions the\r\nproclamation which will be laid before you was issued.\r\n\r\nIn this posture of affairs, both new and delicate, I resolved to adopt\r\ngeneral rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the\r\nprivileges of the United States. These were reduced into a system, which\r\nwill be communicated to you. Although I have not thought myself at\r\nliberty to forbid the sale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of\r\ncommerce with France to be brought into our ports, I have not refused to\r\ncause them to be restored when they were taken within the protection of\r\nour territory, or by vessels commissioned or equipped in a warlike form\r\nwithin the limits of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, improve, or enforce\r\nthis plan of procedure; and it will probably be found expedient to\r\nextend the legal code and the jurisdiction of the courts of the United\r\nStates to many cases which, though dependent on principles already\r\nrecognized, demand some further provisions.\r\n\r\nWhere individuals shall, within the United States, array themselves\r\nin hostility against any of the powers at war, or enter upon military\r\nexpeditions or enterprises within the jurisdiction of the United States,\r\nor usurp and exercise judicial authority within the United States, or\r\nwhere the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been\r\nindistinctly marked, or are inadequate--these offenses can not receive\r\ntoo early and close an attention, and require prompt and decisive\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nWhatsoever those remedies may be, they will be well administered by\r\nthe judiciary, who possess a long-established course of investigation,\r\neffectual process, and officers in the habit of executing it.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, as several of the courts have doubted, under particular\r\ncircumstances, their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace,\r\nand even of a citizen of the United States, although seized under a\r\nfalse color of being hostile property, and have denied their power to\r\nliberate certain captures within the protection of our territory, it\r\nwould seem proper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points. But if\r\nthe Executive is to be the resort in either of the two last-mentioned\r\ncases, it is hoped that he will be authorized by law to have facts\r\nascertained by the courts when for his own information he shall\r\nrequest it.\r\n\r\nI can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our\r\nduties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the\r\nnecessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of\r\nexacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United\r\nStates ought not to indulge a persuasion that, contrary to the order of\r\nhuman events, they will forever keep at a distance those painful appeals\r\nto arms with which the history of every other nation abounds. There is\r\na rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld,\r\nif not absolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to\r\navoid insult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace,\r\none of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must\r\nbe known that we are at all times ready for war. The documents which\r\nwill be presented to you will shew the amount and kinds of arms and\r\nmilitary stores now in our magazines and arsenals; and yet an addition\r\neven to these supplies can not with prudence be neglected, as it would\r\nleave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring of warlike apparatus in\r\nthe moment of public danger.\r\n\r\nNor can such arrangements, with such objects, be exposed to the censure\r\nor jealousy of the warmest friends of republican government. They are\r\nincapable of abuse in the hands of the militia, who ought to possess\r\na pride in being the depository of the force of the Republic, and may\r\nbe trained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency of\r\nthe United States. But it is an inquiry which can not be too solemnly\r\npursued, whether the act \"more effectually to provide for the national\r\ndefense by establishing an uniform militia throughout the United States\"\r\nhas organized them so as to produce their full effect; whether your own\r\nexperience in the several States has not detected some imperfections in\r\nthe scheme, and whether a material feature in an improvement of it ought\r\nnot to be to afford an opportunity for the study of those branches of\r\nthe military art which can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone.\r\n\r\nThe connection of the United States with Europe has become extremely\r\ninteresting. The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under\r\nthe knowledge of the Executive will be exhibited to Congress in a\r\nsubsequent communication.\r\n\r\nWhen we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmed\r\nthat every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of\r\ndissension with the Indians north of the Ohio. The instructions given\r\nto the commissioners evince a moderation and equity proceeding from a\r\nsincere love of peace, and a liberality having no restriction but the\r\nessential interests and dignity of the United States. The attempt,\r\nhowever, of an amicable negotiation having been frustrated, the troops\r\nhave marched to act offensively. Although the proposed treaty did not\r\narrest the progress of military preparation, it is doubtful how far the\r\nadvance of the season, before good faith justified active movements,\r\nmay retard them during the remainder of the year. From the papers and\r\nintelligence which relate to this important subject you will determine\r\nwhether the deficiency in the number of troops granted by law shall be\r\ncompensated by succors of militia, or additional encouragements shall\r\nbe proposed to recruits.\r\n\r\nAn anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace with\r\nthe Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn\r\nand with clothing, and offensive measures against them prohibited\r\nduring the recess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the latter,\r\nprosecutions have been instituted for the violences committed upon them.\r\nBut the papers which will be delivered to you disclose the critical\r\nfooting on which we stand in regard to both those tribes, and it is\r\nwith Congress to pronounce what shall be done.\r\n\r\nAfter they shall have provided for the present emergency, it will merit\r\ntheir most serious labors to render tranquillity with the savages\r\npermanent by creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of\r\njustice on the violators of peace, the establishment of commerce with\r\nthe Indian nations in behalf of the United States is most likely to\r\nconciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud,\r\nwithout extortion, with constant and plentiful supplies, with a ready\r\nmarket for the commodities of the Indians and a stated price for what\r\nthey give in payment and receive in exchange. Individuals will not\r\npursue such a traffic unless they be allured by the hope of profit; but\r\nit will be enough for the United States to be reimbursed only. Should\r\nthis recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress, they will\r\nrecollect that it can not be accomplished by any means yet in the hands\r\nof the Executive.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe commissioners charged with the settlement of accounts between the\r\nUnited States and individual States concluded their important functions\r\nwithin the time limited by law, and the balances struck in their report,\r\nwhich will be laid before Congress, have been placed on the books of\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of June last an installment of 1,000,000 florins became\r\npayable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjusted\r\nby a prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loan\r\nat an interest of 5 per cent for the term of ten years, and the expenses\r\nof this operation were a commission of 3 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe first installment of the loan of $2,000,000 from the Bank of the\r\nUnited States has been paid, as was directed by law. For the second it\r\nis necessary that provision should be made.\r\n\r\nNo pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the regular redemption\r\nand discharge of the public debt. On none can delay be more injurious\r\nor an economy of time more valuable.\r\n\r\nThe productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued to\r\nequal the anticipations which were formed of it, but it is not expected\r\nto prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested.\r\nSome auxiliary provisions will therefore, it is presumed, be requisite,\r\nand it is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to\r\nthe convenience of our citizens, who can not but be sensible of the true\r\nwisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions\r\nto obviate a future accumulation of burthens.\r\n\r\nBut here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the\r\ntransportation of public prints. There is no resource so firm for the\r\nGovernment of the United States as the affections of the people, guided\r\nby an enlightened policy; and to this primary good nothing can conduce\r\nmore than a faithful representation of public proceedings, diffused\r\nwithout restraint throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current service of\r\nthe ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and military\r\nstores made during the recess will be presented to Congress.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe several subjects to which I have now referred open a wide range to\r\nyour deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of our\r\ncommon country. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude\r\nof your task. Without an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the\r\nGovernment may be hazarded; without harmony as far as consists with\r\nfreedom of sentiment its dignity may be lost. But as the legislative\r\nproceedings of the United States will never, I trust, be reproached\r\nfor the want of temper or of candor, so shall not the public happiness\r\nlanguish from the want of my strenuous and warmest cooperation.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:\r\n\r\nAccept, sir, the thanks of the Senate for your speech delivered to both\r\nHouses of Congress at the opening of the session. Your reelection to\r\nthe Chief Magistracy of the United States gives us sincere pleasure.\r\nWe consider it as an event every way propitious to the happiness of\r\nour country, and your compliance with the call as a fresh instance of\r\nthe patriotism which has so repeatedly led you to sacrifice private\r\ninclination to the public good. In the unanimity which a second time\r\nmarks this important national act we trace with particular satisfaction,\r\nbesides the distinguished tribute paid to the virtues and abilities\r\nwhich it recognizes, another proof of that just discernment and\r\nconstancy of sentiments and views which have hitherto characterized\r\nthe citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs the European powers with whom the United States have the most\r\nextensive relations were involved in war, in which we had taken no part,\r\nit seemed necessary that the disposition of the nation for peace should\r\nbe promulgated to the world, as well for the purpose of admonishing our\r\ncitizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of acts hostile\r\nto any of the belligerent parties as to obtain by a declaration of the\r\nexisting legal state of things an easier admission of our right to the\r\nimmunities of our situation. We therefore contemplate with pleasure the\r\nproclamation by you issued, and give it our hearty approbation. We deem\r\nit a measure well timed and wise, manifesting a watchful solicitude for\r\nthe welfare of the nation and calculated to promote it.\r\n\r\nThe several important matters presented to our consideration will, in\r\nthe course of the session, engage all the attention to which they are\r\nrespectively entitled, and as the public happiness will be the sole\r\nguide of our deliberations, we are perfectly assured of receiving your\r\nstrenuous and most zealous cooperation.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS,\r\n\r\n_Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate_.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 9, 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: The pleasure expressed by the Senate on my reelection to the\r\nstation which I fill commands my sincere and warmest acknowledgments. If\r\nthis be an event which promises the smallest addition to the happiness\r\nof our country, as it is my duty so shall it be my study to realize the\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nThe decided approbation which the proclamation now receives from your\r\nHouse, by completing the proofs that this measure is considered as\r\nmanifesting a vigilant attention to the welfare of the United States,\r\nbrings with it a peculiar gratification to my mind.\r\n\r\nThe other important subjects which have been communicated to you will,\r\nI am confident, receive a due discussion, and the result will, I trust,\r\nprove fortunate to the United States.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 10, 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The Representatives of the people of the United States, in meeting\r\nyou for the first time since you have been again called by an unanimous\r\nsuffrage to your present station, find an occasion which they embrace\r\nwith no less sincerity than promptitude for expressing to you their\r\ncongratulations on so distinguished a testimony of public approbation,\r\nand their entire confidence in the purity and patriotism of the motives\r\nwhich have produced this obedience to the voice of your country. It\r\nis to virtues which have commanded long and universal reverence and\r\nservices from which have flowed great and lasting benefits that the\r\ntribute of praise may be paid without the reproach of flattery, and it\r\nis from the same sources that the fairest anticipations may be derived\r\nin favor of the public happiness.\r\n\r\nThe United States having taken no part in the war which had embraced\r\nin Europe the powers with whom they have the most extensive relations,\r\nthe maintenance of peace was justly to be regarded as one of the most\r\nimportant duties of the Magistrate charged with the faithful execution\r\nof the laws. We accordingly witness with approbation and pleasure\r\nthe vigilance with which you have guarded against an interruption of\r\nthat blessing by your proclamation admonishing our citizens of the\r\nconsequences of illicit or hostile acts toward the belligerent parties,\r\nand promoting by a declaration of the existing legal state of things\r\nan easier admission of our right to the immunities belonging to our\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe connection of the United States with Europe has evidently become\r\nextremely interesting. The communications which remain to be exhibited\r\nto us will no doubt assist in giving us a fuller view of the subject and\r\nin guiding our deliberations to such results as may comport with the\r\nrights and true interests of our country.\r\n\r\nWe learn with deep regret that the measures, dictated by love of peace,\r\nfor obtaining an amicable termination of the afflicting war on our\r\nfrontiers have been frustrated, and that a resort to offensive measures\r\nshould have again become necessary. As the latter, however, must be\r\nrendered more satisfactory in proportion to the solicitude for peace\r\nmanifested by the former, it is to be hoped they will be pursued under\r\nthe better auspices on that account, and be finally crowned with more\r\nhappy success.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the particular tribes of Indians against whom offensive\r\nmeasures have been prohibited, as well as on all the other important\r\nsubjects which you have presented to our view, we shall bestow the\r\nattention which they claim. We can not, however, refrain at this time\r\nfrom particularly expressing our concurrence in your anxiety for the\r\nregular discharge of the public debts as fast as circumstances and\r\nevents will permit and in the policy of removing any impediments\r\nthat may be found in the way of a faithful representation of public\r\nproceedings throughout the United States, being persuaded with you\r\nthat on no subject more than the former can delay be more injurious or\r\nan economy of time more valuable, and that with respect to the latter\r\nno resource is so firm for the Government of the United States as the\r\naffections of the people, guided by an enlightened policy.\r\n\r\nThroughout our deliberations we shall endeavor to cherish every\r\nsentiment which may contribute to render them conducive to the dignity\r\nas well as to the welfare of the United States; and we join with you in\r\nimploring that Being on whose will the fate of nations depends to crown\r\nwith success our mutual endeavors.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 6, 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I shall not affect to conceal the cordial satisfaction which\r\nI derive from the address of the House of Representatives. Whatsoever\r\nthose services may be which you have sanctioned by your favor, it is\r\na sufficient reward that they have been accepted as they were meant.\r\nFor the fulfillment of your anticipations of the future I can give\r\nno other assurance than that the motives which you approve shall\r\ncontinue unchanged.\r\n\r\nIt is truly gratifying to me to learn that the proclamation has been\r\nconsidered as a seasonable guard against the interruption of the public\r\npeace. Nor can I doubt that the subjects which I have recommended to\r\nyour attention as depending on legislative provisions will receive a\r\ndiscussion suited to their importance. With every reason, then, it may\r\nbe expected that your deliberations, under the divine blessing, will\r\nbe matured to the honor and happiness of the United States.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 7, 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 5, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAs the present situation of the several nations of Europe, and\r\nespecially of those with which the United States have important\r\nrelations, can not but render the state of things between them and us\r\nmatter of interesting inquiry to the Legislature, and may indeed give\r\nrise to deliberations to which they alone are competent, I have thought\r\nit my duty to communicate to them certain correspondences which have\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nThe representative and executive bodies of France have manifested\r\ngenerally a friendly attachment to this country; have given advantages\r\nto our commerce and navigation, and have made overtures for placing\r\nthese advantages on permanent ground. A decree, however, of the National\r\nAssembly subjecting vessels laden with provisions to be carried into\r\ntheir ports and making enemy goods lawful prize in the vessel of a\r\nfriend, contrary to our treaty, though revoked at one time as to the\r\nUnited States, has been since extended to their vessels also, as has\r\nbeen recently stated to us. Representations on this subject will be\r\nimmediately given in charge to our minister there, and the result\r\nshall be communicated to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIt is with extreme concern I have to inform you that the proceedings\r\nof the person whom they have unfortunately appointed their minister\r\nplenipotentiary here have breathed nothing of the friendly spirit of\r\nthe nation which sent him. Their tendency, on the contrary, has been to\r\ninvolve us in war abroad and discord and anarchy at home. So far as his\r\nacts or those of his agents have threatened our immediate commitment in\r\nthe war, or flagrant insult to the authority of the laws, their effect\r\nhas been counteracted by the ordinary cognizance of the laws and by an\r\nexertion of the powers confided to me. Where their danger was not\r\nimminent they have been borne with from sentiments of regard to his\r\nnation, from a sense of their friendship toward us, from a conviction\r\nthat they would not suffer us to remain long exposed to the action of a\r\nperson who has so little respected our mutual dispositions, and, I will\r\nadd, from a reliance on the firmness of my fellow-citizens in their\r\nprinciples of peace and order. In the meantime I have respected and\r\npursued the stipulations of our treaties according to what I judged\r\ntheir true sense, and have withheld no act of friendship which their\r\naffairs have called for from us, and which justice to others left us\r\nfree to perform. I have gone farther. Rather than employ force for the\r\nrestitution of certain vessels which I deemed the United States bound to\r\nrestore, I thought it more advisable to satisfy the parties by avowing\r\nit to be my opinion that if restitution were not made it would be\r\nincumbent on the United States to make compensation. The papers now\r\ncommunicated will more particularly apprise you of these transactions.\r\n\r\nThe vexations and spoliation understood to have been committed on\r\nour vessels and commerce by the cruisers and officers of some of the\r\nbelligerent powers appear to require attention. The proofs of these,\r\nhowever, not having been brought forward, the descriptions of citizens\r\nsupposed to have suffered were notified that, on furnishing them to the\r\nExecutive, due measures would be taken to obtain redress of the past and\r\nmore effectual provisions against the future. Should such documents be\r\nfurnished, proper representations will be made thereon, with a just\r\nreliance on a redress proportioned to the exigency of the case.\r\n\r\nThe British Government having undertaken, by orders to the commanders\r\nof their armed vessels, to restrain generally our commerce in corn and\r\nother provisions to their own ports and those of their friends, the\r\ninstructions now communicated were immediately forwarded to our minister\r\nat that Court. In the meantime some discussions on the subject took\r\nplace between him and them. These are also laid before you, and I may\r\nexpect to learn the result of his special instructions in time to make\r\nit known to the Legislature during their present session.\r\n\r\nVery early after the arrival of a British minister here mutual\r\nexplanations on the inexecution of the treaty of peace were entered into\r\nwith that minister. These are now laid before you for your information.\r\n\r\nOn the subjects of mutual interest between this country and Spain\r\nnegotiations and conferences are now depending. The public good\r\nrequiring that the present state of these should be made known to the\r\nLegislature _in confidence only_, they shall be the subject of a\r\nseparate and subsequent communication.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 16, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe situation of affairs in Europe in the course of the year 1790\r\nhaving rendered it possible that a moment might arrive favorable for\r\nthe arrangement of our unsettled matters with Spain, it was thought\r\nproper to prepare our representative at that Court to avail us of it.\r\nA confidential person was therefore dispatched to be the bearer of\r\ninstructions to him, and to supply, by verbal communications, any\r\nadditional information of which he might find himself in need. The\r\nGovernment of France was at the same time applied to for its aid and\r\ninfluence in this negotiation. Events, however, took a turn which did\r\nnot present the occasion hoped for.\r\n\r\nAbout the close of the ensuing year I was informed through the\r\nrepresentatives of Spain here that their Government would be willing\r\nto renew at Madrid the former conferences on these subjects. Though the\r\ntransfer of scene was not what would have been desired, yet I did not\r\nthink it important enough to reject the proposition, and therefore,\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, I appointed commissioners\r\nplenipotentiary for negotiating and concluding a treaty with that\r\ncountry on the several subjects of boundary, navigation, and commerce,\r\nand gave them the instructions now communicated. Before these\r\nnegotiations, however, could be got into train the new troubles which\r\nhad arisen in Europe had produced new combinations among the powers\r\nthere, the effects of which are but too visible in the proceedings\r\nnow laid before you.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime some other points of discussion had arisen with that\r\ncountry, to wit, the restitution of property escaping into the\r\nterritories of each other, the mutual exchange of fugitives from\r\njustice, and, above all the mutual interferences with the Indians lying\r\nbetween us. I had the best reason to believe that the hostilities\r\nthreatened and exercised by the Southern Indians on our border were\r\nexcited by the agents of that Government. Representations were thereon\r\ndirected to be made by our commissioners to the Spanish Government, and\r\na proposal to cultivate with good faith the peace of each other with\r\nthose people. In the meantime corresponding suspicions were entertained,\r\nor pretended to be entertained, on their part of like hostile\r\nexcitements by our agents to disturb their peace with the same nations.\r\nThese were brought forward by the representatives of Spain here in a\r\nstyle which could not fail to produce attention. A claim of patronage\r\nand protection of those Indians was asserted; a mediation between them\r\nand us by that sovereign assumed; their boundaries with us made a\r\nsubject of his interference, and at length, at the very moment when\r\nthese savages were committing daily inroads upon our frontier, we were\r\ninformed by them that \"the continuation of the peace, good harmony, and\r\nperfect friendship of the two nations was very problematical for the\r\nfuture, unless the United States should take more convenient measures\r\nand of greater energy than those adopted for a long time past.\"\r\n\r\nIf their previous correspondence had worn the appearance of a desire to\r\nurge on a disagreement, this last declaration left no room to evade it,\r\nsince it could not be conceived we would submit to the scalping knife\r\nand tomahawk of the savage without any resistance. I thought it time,\r\ntherefore, to know if these were the views of their sovereign, and\r\ndispatched a special messenger with instructions to our commissioners,\r\nwhich are among the papers now communicated. Their last letter gives us\r\nreason to expect very shortly to know the result. I must add that the\r\nSpanish representatives here, perceiving that their last communication\r\nhad made considerable impression, endeavored to abate this by some\r\nsubsequent professions, which, being also among the communications\r\nto the Legislature, they will be able to form their own conclusions.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 16, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a report of the Secretary of State on the measures\r\nwhich have been taken on behalf of the United States for the purpose of\r\nobtaining a recognition of our treaty with Morocco and for the ransom of\r\nour citizens and establishment of peace with Algiers.\r\n\r\nWhile it is proper our citizens should know that subjects which so\r\nmuch concern their interest and their feelings have duly engaged the\r\nattention of their Legislature and Executive, it would still be improper\r\nthat some particulars of this communication should be made known.\r\nThe confidential conversation stated in one of the last letters sent\r\nherewith is one of these. Both justice and policy require that the\r\nsource of that information should remain secret. So a knowledge of\r\nthe sums meant to have been given for peace and ransom might have a\r\ndisadvantageous influence on future proceedings for the same objects.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 23, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nSince the communications which were made to you on the affairs of the\r\nUnited States with Spain and on the truce between Portugal and Algiers\r\nsome other papers have been received, which, making a part of the same\r\nsubjects, are now communicated for your information.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 30, 1793_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you, for your consideration, a letter from the Secretary\r\nof State, informing me of certain impediments which have arisen to the\r\ncoinage of the precious metals at the Mint, as also a letter from the\r\nsame officer relative to certain advances of money which have been made\r\non public account. Should you think proper to sanction what has been\r\ndone, or be of opinion that anything more shall be done in the same way,\r\nyou will judge whether there are not circumstances which would render\r\nsecrecy expedient.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 7, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nExperience has shewn that it would be useful to have an officer\r\nparticularly charged, under the direction of the Department of War,\r\nwith the duties of receiving, safe-keeping, and distributing the public\r\nsupplies in all cases in which the laws and the course of service do not\r\ndevolve them upon other officers, and also with that of superintending\r\nin all cases the issues in detail of supplies, with power for that\r\npurpose to bring to account all persons intrusted to make such issues\r\nin relation thereto.\r\n\r\nAn establishment of this nature, by securing a regular and punctual\r\naccountability for the issues of public supplies, would be a great guard\r\nagainst abuse, would tend to insure their due application and to give\r\npublic satisfaction on that point.\r\n\r\nI therefore recommend to the consideration of Congress the expediency of\r\nan establishment of this nature, under such regulations as shall appear\r\nto them advisable,\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 20, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHaving already laid before you a letter of the 16th of August, 1793,\r\nfrom the Secretary of State to our minister at Paris, stating the\r\nconduct and urging the recall of the minister plenipotentiary of the\r\nRepublic of France, I now communicate to you that his conduct has been\r\nunequivocally disapproved, and that the strongest assurances have been\r\ngiven that his recall should be expedited without delay.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 21, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction I announce to you that the alterations which\r\nhave been made by law in the original plan for raising a duty on spirits\r\ndistilled within the United States, and on stills, cooperating with\r\nbetter information, have had a considerable influence in obviating the\r\ndifficulties which have embarrassed that branch of the public revenue.\r\nBut the obstacles which have been experienced, though lessened, are not\r\nyet entirely surmounted, and it would seem that some further legislative\r\nprovisions may usefully be superadded, which leads me to recall the\r\nattention of Congress to the subject. Among the matters which may demand\r\nregulation is the effect, in point of organization, produced by the\r\nseparation of Kentucky from the State of Virginia, and the situation\r\nwith regard to the law of the territories northwest and southwest of\r\nthe Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe laws respecting light-house establishments require, as a condition\r\nof their permanent maintenance at the expense of the United States, a\r\ncomplete cession of soil and jurisdiction. The cessions of different\r\nStates having been qualified with a reservation of the right of serving\r\nlegal process within the ceded jurisdiction are understood to be\r\ninconclusive as annexing a qualification not consonant with the terms of\r\nthe law. I present this circumstance to the view of Congress, that they\r\nmay judge whether any alteration ought to be made.\r\n\r\nAs it appears to be conformable with the intention of the \"ordinance for\r\nthe government of the territory of the United States northwest of the\r\nriver Ohio,\" although it is not expressly directed that the laws of that\r\nterritory should be laid before Congress, I now transmit to you a copy\r\nof such as have been passed from July to December, 1792, inclusive.\r\nbeing the last which have been received by the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 30, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nCommunications have been made to Congress during the present session\r\nwith the intention of affording a full view of the posture of affairs\r\non the Southwestern frontiers. By the information which has lately been\r\nlaid before Congress it appeared that the difficulties with the Creeks\r\nhad been amicably and happily terminated; but it will be perceived with\r\nregret by the papers herewith transmitted that the tranquillity has,\r\nunfortunately, been of short duration, owing to the murder of several\r\nfriendly Indians by some lawless white men.\r\n\r\nThe condition of things in that quarter requires the serious and\r\nimmediate consideration of Congress, and the adoption of such wise and\r\nvigorous laws as will be competent to the preservation of the national\r\ncharacter and of the peace made under the authority of the United States\r\nwith the several Indian tribes. Experience demonstrates that the\r\nexisting legal provisions are entirely inadequate to those great\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 7, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to you an act and three ordinances passed by the government\r\nof the territory of the United States south of the river Ohio on the\r\n13th and 21st of March and the 7th of May, 1793, and also certain\r\nletters from the minister plenipotentiary of the French Republic to\r\nthe Secretary of State, inclosing dispatches from the general and\r\nextraordinary commission of Guadaloupe.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 19, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you the copy of a letter which I have received from the\r\nChief Justice and associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, and, at their desire, the representation mentioned in the said\r\nletter, pointing out certain defects in the judiciary system.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 24, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe extracts which I now lay before you, from a letter of our minister\r\nat London, are supplementary to some of my past communications, and will\r\nappear to be of a confidential nature.\r\n\r\nI also transmit to you copies of a letter from the Secretary of State\r\nto the minister plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty, and of the\r\nanswer thereto, upon the subject of the treaty between the United States\r\nand Great Britain, together with the copy of a letter from Messrs.\r\nCarmichael and Short, relative to our affairs with Spain, which letter\r\nis connected with a former confidential message,\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 26, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI have caused the correspondence which is the subject of your\r\nresolution of the 24th day of January last to be laid before me. After\r\nan examination of it I directed copies and translations to be made,\r\nexcept in those particulars which, in my judgment, for public\r\nconsiderations, ought not to be communicated.\r\n\r\nThese copies and translations are now transmitted to the Senate; but\r\nthe nature of them manifests the propriety of their being received as\r\nconfidential.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 3, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to you an extract from a letter of Mr. Short, relative to\r\nour affairs with Spain, and copies of two letters from our minister at\r\nLisbon, with their inclosures, containing intelligence from Algiers. The\r\nwhole of these communications are made in confidence, except the passage\r\nin Mr. Short's letter which respects the Spanish convoy.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 5, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State having reported to me upon the several complaints\r\nwhich have been lodged in his office against the vexations and\r\nspoliations on our commerce since the commencement of the European war,\r\nI transmit to you a copy of his statement, together with the documents\r\nupon which it is founded.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 18, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe minister plenipotentiary of the French Republic having requested an\r\nadvance of money, I transmit to Congress certain documents relative to\r\nthat subject.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 28, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_;\r\n\r\nIn the execution of the resolution of Congress bearing date the 26th of\r\nMarch, 1794, and imposing an embargo, I have requested the governors of\r\nthe several States to call forth the force of their militia, if it\r\nshould be necessary, for the detention of vessels. This power is\r\nconceived to be incidental to an embargo.\r\n\r\nIt also deserves the attention of Congress how far the clearances from\r\none district to another, under the law as it now stands, may give rise\r\nto evasions of the embargo. As one security the collectors have been\r\ninstructed to refuse to receive the surrender of coasting licenses for\r\nthe purpose of taking out registers, and to require bond from registered\r\nvessels bound from one district to another, for the delivery of the\r\ncargo within the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is not understood that the resolution applies to fishing vessels,\r\nalthough their occupations lie generally in parts beyond the United\r\nStates. But without further restrictions there is an opportunity of\r\ntheir privileges being used as means of eluding the embargo.\r\n\r\nAll armed vessels possessing public commissions from any foreign power\r\n(letters of marque excepted) are considered as not liable to the embargo.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances are transmitted to Congress for their consideration.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 4, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you three letters from our minister in London, advices\r\nconcerning the Algerine mission from our minister at Lisbon and others,\r\nand a letter from the minister plenipotentiary of the French Republic\r\nto the Secretary of State, with his answer.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 15, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a letter from the minister plenipotentiary of His\r\nBritannic Majesty to the Secretary of State; a letter from the secretary\r\nof the territory south of the river Ohio, inclosing an ordinance and\r\nproclamation of the governor thereof; the translation of so much of\r\na petition of the inhabitants of Post Vincennes, addressed to the\r\nPresident, as relates to Congress, and certain dispatches lately\r\nreceived from our commissioners at Madrid. These dispatches from\r\nMadrid being a part of the business which has been hitherto deemed\r\nconfidential, they are forwarded under that view.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 16, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe communications which I have made to you during your present session\r\nfrom the dispatches of our minister in London contain a serious aspect\r\nof our affairs with Great Britain. But as peace ought to be pursued with\r\nunremitted zeal before the last resource, which has so often been the\r\nscourge of nations, and can not fail to check the advanced prosperity of\r\nthe United States, is contemplated, I have thought proper to nominate,\r\nand do hereby nominate, John Jay as envoy extraordinary of the United\r\nStates to His Britannic Majesty.\r\n\r\nMy confidence in our minister plenipotentiary in London continues\r\nundiminished. But a mission like this, while it corresponds with the\r\nsolemnity of the occasion, will announce to the world a solicitude for\r\na friendly adjustment of our complaints and a reluctance to hostility.\r\nGoing immediately from the United States, such an envoy will carry with\r\nhim a full knowledge of the existing temper and sensibility of our\r\ncountry, and will thus be taught to vindicate our rights with firmness\r\nand to cultivate peace with sincerity.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 12, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAs the letter which I forwarded to Congress on the 15th day of April\r\nlast, from the minister plenipotentiary of His Britannic Majesty to the\r\nSecretary of State, in answer to a memorial of our minister in London,\r\nrelated to a very interesting subject, I thought it proper not to delay\r\nits communication. But since that time the memorial itself has been\r\nreceived in a letter from our minister, and a reply has been made to\r\nthat answer by the Secretary of State. Copies of them are therefore now\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nI also send the copy of a letter from the governor of Rhode Island,\r\ninclosing an act of the legislature of that State empowering the United\r\nStates to hold lands within the same for the purpose of erecting\r\nfortifications, and certain papers concerning patents for the donation\r\nlands to the ancient settlers of Vincennes upon the Wabash.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 20, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn the communications which I have made to Congress during the present\r\nsession relative to foreign nations I have omitted no opportunity of\r\ntestifying my anxiety to preserve the United States in peace. It is\r\npeculiarly, therefore, my duty at this time to lay before you the\r\npresent state of certain hostile threats against the territories of\r\nSpain in our neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe documents which accompany this message develop the measures which I\r\nhave taken to suppress them, and the intelligence which has been lately\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from thence that the subject has not been neglected;\r\nthat every power vested in the Executive on such occasions has been\r\nexerted, and that there was reason to believe that the enterprise\r\nprojected against the Spanish dominions was relinquished.\r\n\r\nBut it appears to have been revived upon principles which set public\r\norder at defiance and place the peace of the United States in the\r\ndiscretion of unauthorized individuals. The means already deposited in\r\nthe different departments of Government are shewn by experience not to\r\nbe adequate to these high exigencies, although such of them as are\r\nlodged in the hands of the Executive shall continue to be used with\r\npromptness, energy, and decision proportioned to the case. But I am\r\nimpelled by the position of our public affairs to recommend that\r\nprovision be made for a stronger and more vigorous opposition than can\r\nbe given to such hostile movements under the laws as they now stand.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 21, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you in confidence sundry papers, by which you will\r\nperceive the state of affairs between us and the Six Nations, and\r\nthe probable cause to which it is owing, and also certain information\r\nwhereby it would appear that some encroachment was about to be made on\r\nour territory by an officer and party of British troops. Proceeding\r\nupon a supposition of the authenticity of this information, although\r\nof a private nature, I have caused the representation to be made to\r\nthe British minister a copy of which accompanies this message.\r\n\r\nIt can not be necessary to comment upon the very serious nature of such\r\nan encroachment, nor to urge that this new state of things suggests\r\nthe propriety of placing the United States in a posture of effectual\r\npreparation for an event which, notwithstanding the endeavors making to\r\navert it, may by circumstances beyond our control be forced upon us.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 26, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe commissioners of His Catholic Majesty having communicated to the\r\nSecretary of State the form of a certificate without which the vessels\r\nof the United States can not be admitted into the ports of Spain,\r\nI think it proper to lay it before Congress.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 27, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe Executive Provisory Council of the French Republic having requested\r\nme to recall Gouverneur Morris, our minister plenipotentiary in France,\r\nI have thought proper, in pursuance of that request, to recall him.\r\nI therefore nominate James Monroe, of Virginia, as minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States to the said Republic.\r\n\r\nI also nominate William Short, now minister resident for the United\r\nStates with Their High Mightinesses the States-General of the United\r\nNetherlands, to be minister resident for the United States to His\r\nCatholic Majesty, in the room of William Carmichael, who is recalled.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 2, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI send you certain communications, recently received from Georgia, which\r\nmaterially change the prospect of affairs in that quarter, and seem to\r\nrender a war with the Creek Nations more probable than it has been at\r\nany antecedent period. While the attention of Congress will be directed\r\nto the consideration of measures suited to the exigency, it can not\r\nescape their observation that this intelligence brings a fresh proof\r\nof the insufficiency of the existing provisions of the laws toward\r\nthe effectual cultivation and preservation of peace with our Indian\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From a broadside in the archives of the Department of State.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas it appears that a state of war exists between Austria, Prussia,\r\nSardinia, Great Britain, and the United Netherlands of the one part and\r\nFrance on the other, and the duty and interest of the United States\r\nrequire that they should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue\r\na conduct friendly and impartial toward the belligerent powers:\r\n\r\nI have therefore thought fit by these presents to declare the\r\ndisposition of the United States to observe the conduct aforesaid toward\r\nthose powers respectively, and to exhort and warn the citizens of the\r\nUnited States carefully to avoid all acts and proceedings whatsoever\r\nwhich may in any manner tend to contravene such disposition.\r\n\r\nAnd I do hereby also make known that whosoever of the citizens of the\r\nUnited States shall render himself liable to punishment or forfeiture\r\nunder the law of nations by committing, aiding, or abetting hostilities\r\nagainst any of the said powers, or by carrying to any of them those\r\narticles which are deemed contraband by the modern usage of nations,\r\nwill not receive the protection of the United States against such\r\npunishment or forfeiture;

and\r\n\r\nWhereas such unwarrantable measures, being contrary to the laws of\r\nnations and to the duties incumbent on every citizen of the United\r\nStates, tend to disturb the tranquillity of the same, and to involve\r\nthem in the calamities of war; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is the duty of the Executive to take care that such criminal\r\nproceedings should be suppressed, the offenders brought to justice,\r\nand all good citizens cautioned against measures likely to prove so\r\npernicious to their country and themselves, should they be seduced into\r\nsimilar infractions of the laws:\r\n\r\nI have therefore thought proper to issue this proclamation, hereby\r\nsolemnly warning every person, not authorized by the laws, against\r\nenlisting any citizen or citizens of the United States, or levying\r\ntroops, or assembling any persons within the United States for the\r\npurposes aforesaid, or proceeding in any manner to the execution\r\nthereof, as they will answer for the same at their peril;

RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Fourth Congress, second session, 2796.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas combinations to defeat the execution of the laws laying duties\r\nupon spirits distilled within the United States and upon stills have\r\nfrom the time of the commencement of those laws existed in some of the\r\nwestern parts of Pennsylvania; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the said combinations, proceeding in a manner subversive\r\nequally of the just authority of government and of the rights of\r\nindividuals, have hitherto effected their dangerous and criminal\r\npurpose by the influence of certain irregular meetings whose proceedings\r\nhave tended to encourage and uphold the spirit of opposition by\r\nmisrepresentations of the laws calculated to render them odious; by\r\nendeavors to deter those who might be so disposed from accepting offices\r\nunder them through fear of public resentment and of injury to person and\r\nproperty, and to compel those who had accepted such offices by actual\r\nviolence to surrender or forbear the execution of them; by circulating\r\nvindictive menaces against all those who should otherwise, directly or\r\nindirectly, aid in the execution of the said laws, or who, yielding\r\nto the dictates of conscience and to a sense of obligation, should\r\nthemselves comply therewith; by actually injuring and destroying\r\nthe property of persons who were understood to have so complied; by\r\ninflicting cruel and humiliating punishments upon private citizens for\r\nno other cause than that of appearing to be the friends of the laws; by\r\nintercepting the public officers on the highways, abusing, assaulting,\r\nand otherwise ill treating them; by going to their houses in the night,\r\ngaining admittance by force, taking away their papers, and committing\r\nother outrages, employing for these unwarrantable purposes the agency of\r\narmed banditti disguised in such manner as for the most part to escape\r\ndiscovery; and\r\n\r\nWhereas the endeavors of the Legislature to obviate objections to the\r\nsaid laws by lowering the duties and by other alterations conducive\r\nto the convenience of those whom they immediately affect (though they\r\nhave given satisfaction in other quarters), and the endeavors of\r\nthe executive officers to conciliate a compliance with the laws by\r\nexplanations, by forbearance, and even by particular accommodations\r\nfounded on the suggestion of local considerations, have been\r\ndisappointed of their effect by the machinations of persons whose\r\nindustry to excite resistance has increased with every appearance of\r\na disposition among the people to relax in their opposition and to\r\nacquiesce in the laws, insomuch that many persons in the said western\r\nparts of Pennsylvania have at length been hardy enough to perpetrate\r\nacts which I am advised amount to treason, being overt acts of levying\r\nwar against the United States, the said persons having on the 16th and\r\n17th July last past proceeded in arms (on the second day amounting to\r\nseveral hundreds) to the house of John Neville, inspector of the revenue\r\nfor the fourth survey of the district of Pennsylvania; having repeatedly\r\nattacked the said house with the persons therein, wounding some of them;\r\nhaving seized David Lenox, marshal of the district of Pennsylvania, who\r\nprevious thereto had been fired upon while in the execution of his duty\r\nby a party of armed men, detaining him for some time prisoner, till for\r\nthe preservation of his life and the obtaining of his liberty he found\r\nit necessary to enter into stipulations to forbear the execution of\r\ncertain official duties touching processes issuing out of a court of the\r\nUnited States; and having finally obliged the said inspector of the said\r\nrevenue and the said marshal from considerations of personal safety to\r\nfly from that part of the country, in order, by a circuitous route, to\r\nproceed to the seat of Government, avowing as the motives of these\r\noutrageous proceedings an intention to prevent by force of arms the\r\nexecution of the said laws, to oblige the said inspector of the revenue\r\nto renounce his said office, to withstand by open violence the lawful\r\nauthority of the Government of the United States, and to compel thereby\r\nan alteration in the measures of the Legislature and a repeal of the\r\nlaws aforesaid; and\r\n\r\nWhereas by a law of the United States entitled \"An act to provide for\r\ncalling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress\r\ninsurrections, and repel invasions,\" it is enacted \"that whenever the\r\nlaws of the United States shall be opposed or the execution thereof\r\nobstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be suppressed\r\nby the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested\r\nin the marshals by that act, the same being notified by an associate\r\njustice or the district judge, it shall be lawful for the President of\r\nthe United States to call forth the militia of such State to suppress\r\nsuch combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed. And if the\r\nmilitia of a State where such combinations may happen shall refuse or be\r\ninsufficient to suppress the same, it shall be lawful for the President,\r\nif the Legislature of the United States shall not be in session, to\r\ncall forth and employ such numbers of the militia of any other State or\r\nStates most convenient thereto as may be necessary; and the use of the\r\nmilitia so to be called forth may be continued, if necessary, until the\r\nexpiration of thirty days after the commencement of the ensuing session:\r\n_Provided always_, That whenever it may be necessary in the judgment\r\nof the President to use the military force hereby directed to be\r\ncalled forth, the President shall forthwith, and previous thereto, by\r\nproclamation, command such insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably\r\nto their respective abodes within a limited time;\" and\r\n\r\nWhereas James Wilson, an associate justice, on the 4th instant, by\r\nwriting under his hand, did from evidence which had been laid before\r\nhim notify to me that \"in the counties of Washington and Allegany, in\r\nPennsylvania, laws of the United States are opposed and the execution\r\nthereof obstructed by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the\r\nordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the\r\nmarshal of that district;\" and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is in my judgment necessary under the circumstances of the\r\ncase to take measures for calling forth the militia in order to suppress\r\nthe combinations aforesaid, and to cause the laws to be duly executed;\r\nand I have accordingly determined so to do, feeling the deepest regret\r\nfor the occasion, but withal the most solemn conviction that the\r\nessential interests of the Union demand it, that the very existence of\r\nGovernment and the fundamental principles of social order are materially\r\ninvolved in the issue, and that the patriotism and firmness of all good\r\ncitizens are seriously called upon, as occasions may require, to aid in\r\nthe effectual suppression of so fatal a spirit:\r\n\r\nWherefore, and in pursuance of the proviso above recited, I, George\r\nWashington, President of the United States, do hereby command all\r\npersons being insurgents as aforesaid, and all others whom it may\r\nconcern, on or before the 1st day of September next to disperse and\r\nretire peaceably to their respective abodes.

RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Annals of Congress, Third Congress, 1413.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas from a hope that the combinations against the Constitution\r\nand laws of the United States in certain of the western counties of\r\nPennsylvania would yield to time and reflection I thought it sufficient\r\nin the first instance rather to take measures for calling forth the\r\nmilitia than immediately to embody them, but the moment is now come when\r\nthe overtures of forgiveness, with no other condition than a submission\r\nto law, have been only partially accepted; when every form of\r\nconciliation not inconsistent with the being of Government has been\r\nadopted without effect; when the well-disposed in those counties are\r\nunable by their influence and example to reclaim the wicked from their\r\nfury, and are compelled to associate in their own defense; when the\r\nproffered lenity has been perversely misinterpreted into an apprehension\r\nthat the citizens will march with reluctance; when the opportunity of\r\nexamining the serious consequences of a treasonable opposition has been\r\nemployed in propagating principles of anarchy, endeavoring through\r\nemissaries to alienate the friends of order from its support, and\r\ninviting its enemies to perpetrate similar acts of insurrection; when\r\nit is manifest that violence would continue to be exercised upon every\r\nattempt to enforce the laws; when, therefore, Government is set at\r\ndefiance, the contest being whether a small portion of the United States\r\nshall dictate to the whole Union, and, at the expense of those who\r\ndesire peace, indulge a desperate ambition:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, George Washington, President of the United States,\r\nin obedience to that high and irresistible duty consigned to me by\r\nthe Constitution \"to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\"\r\ndeploring that the American name should be sullied by the outrages of\r\ncitizens on their own Government, commiserating such as remain obstinate\r\nfrom delusion, but resolved, in perfect reliance on that gracious\r\nProvidence which so signally displays its goodness towards this country,\r\nto reduce the refractory to a due subordination to the law, do hereby\r\ndeclare and make known that, with a satisfaction which can be equaled\r\nonly by the merits of the militia summoned into service from the States\r\nof New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, I have received\r\nintelligence of their patriotic alacrity in obeying the call of the\r\npresent, though painful, yet commanding necessity; that a force which,\r\naccording to every reasonable expectation, is adequate to the exigency\r\nis already in motion to the scene of disaffection; that those who have\r\nconfided or shall confide in the protection of Government shall meet\r\nfull succor under the standard and from the arms of the United States;\r\nthat those who, having offended against the laws, have since entitled\r\nthemselves to indemnity will be treated with the most liberal good faith\r\nif they shall not have forfeited their claim by any subsequent conduct,\r\nand that instructions are given accordingly.\r\n\r\nAnd I do moreover exhort all individuals, officers, and bodies of men to\r\ncontemplate with abhorrence the measures leading directly or indirectly\r\nto those crimes which produce this resort to military coercion; to check\r\nin their respective spheres the efforts of misguided or designing men\r\nto substitute their misrepresentation in the place of truth and their\r\ndiscontents in the place of stable government, and to call to mind\r\nthat, as the people of the United States have been permitted, under the\r\nDivine favor, in perfect freedom, after solemn deliberation, and in an\r\nenlightened age, to elect their own government, so will their gratitude\r\nfor this inestimable blessing be best distinguished by firm exertions\r\nto maintain the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, I again warn all persons whomsoever and wheresoever not to\r\nabet, aid, or comfort the insurgents aforesaid, as they will answer the\r\ncontrary at their peril; and I do also require all officers and other\r\ncitizens, according to their several duties, as far as may be in their\r\npower, to bring under the cognizance of the laws all offenders in the\r\npremises. In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United\r\nStates of America to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same\r\nwith my hand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Philadelphia, the 25th day of September, 1794, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  EDM. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH ANNUAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 19, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_;\r\n\r\nWhen we call to mind the gracious indulgence of Heaven by which the\r\nAmerican people became a nation; when we survey the general prosperity\r\nof our country, and look forward to the riches, power, and happiness to\r\nwhich it seems destined, with the deepest regret do I announce to you\r\nthat during your recess some of the citizens of the United States have\r\nbeen found capable of an insurrection. It is due, however, to the\r\ncharacter of our Government and to its stability, which can not be\r\nshaken by the enemies of order, freely to unfold the course of this\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of the year 1790 it was expedient to exercise the\r\nlegislative power granted by the Constitution of the United States\r\n\"to lay and collect excises.\" In a majority of the States scarcely an\r\nobjection was heard to this mode of taxation. In some, indeed, alarms\r\nwere at first conceived, until they were banished by reason and\r\npatriotism. In the four western counties of Pennsylvania a prejudice,\r\nfostered and imbittered by the artifice of men who labored for an\r\nascendency over the will of others by the guidance of their passions,\r\nproduced symptoms of riot and violence. It is well known that Congress\r\ndid not hesitate to examine the complaints which were presented, and\r\nto relieve them as far as justice dictated or general convenience\r\nwould permit. But the impression which this moderation made on the\r\ndiscontented did not correspond with what it deserved. The arts\r\nof delusion were no longer confined to the efforts of designing\r\nindividuals. The very forbearance to press prosecutions was\r\nmisinterpreted into a fear of urging the execution of the laws, and\r\nassociations of men began to denounce threats against the officers\r\nemployed. From a belief that by a more formal concert their operation\r\nmight be defeated, certain self-created societies assumed the tone of\r\ncondemnation. Hence, while the greater part of Pennsylvania itself\r\nwere conforming themselves to the acts of excise, a few counties were\r\nresolved to frustrate them. It was now perceived that every expectation\r\nfrom the tenderness which had been hitherto pursued was unavailing,\r\nand that further delay could only create an opinion of impotency or\r\nirresolution in the Government. Legal process was therefore delivered\r\nto the marshal against the rioters and delinquent distillers.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was he understood to be engaged in this duty than the\r\nvengeance of armed men was aimed at _his_ person and the person and\r\nproperty of the inspector of the revenue. They fired upon the marshal,\r\narrested him, and detained him for some time as a prisoner. He was\r\nobliged, by the jeopardy of his life, to renounce the service of other\r\nprocess on the west side of the Allegheny Mountain, and a deputation was\r\nafterwards sent to him to demand a surrender of that which he _had_\r\nserved. A numerous body repeatedly attacked the house of the inspector,\r\nseized his papers of office, and finally destroyed by fire his buildings\r\nand whatsoever they contained. Both of these officers, from a just\r\nregard to their safety, fled to the seat of Government, it being avowed\r\nthat the motives to such outrages were to compel the resignation of the\r\ninspector, to withstand by force of arms the authority of the United\r\nStates, and thereby to extort a repeal of the laws of excise and an\r\nalteration in the conduct of Government.\r\n\r\nUpon the testimony of these facts an associate justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States notified to me that \"in the counties of\r\nWashington and Allegheny, in Pennsylvania, laws of the United States\r\nwere opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, by combinations too\r\npowerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings\r\nor by the powers vested in the marshal of that district.\" On this call,\r\nmomentous in the extreme, I sought and weighed what might best subdue\r\nthe crisis. On the one hand the judiciary was pronounced to be stripped\r\nof its capacity to enforce the laws; crimes which reached the very\r\nexistence of social order were perpetrated without control; the friends\r\nof Government were insulted, abused, and overawed into silence or an\r\napparent acquiescence; and to yield to the treasonable fury of so small\r\na portion of the United States would be to violate the fundamental\r\nprinciple of our Constitution, which enjoins that the will of the\r\nmajority shall prevail. On the other, to array citizen against citizen,\r\nto publish the dishonor of such excesses, to encounter the expense and\r\nother embarrassments of so distant an expedition, were steps too\r\ndelicate, too closely interwoven with many affecting considerations, to\r\nbe lightly adopted. I postponed, therefore, the summoning the militia\r\nimmediately into the field, but I required them to be held in readiness,\r\nthat if my anxious endeavors to reclaim the deluded and to convince the\r\nmalignant of their danger should be fruitless, military force might be\r\nprepared to act before the season should be too far advanced.\r\n\r\nMy proclamation of the 7th of August last was accordingly issued, and\r\naccompanied by the appointment of commissioners, who were charged to\r\nrepair to the scene of insurrection. They were authorized to confer with\r\nany bodies of men or individuals. They were instructed to be candid\r\nand explicit in stating the sensations which had been excited in the\r\nExecutive, and his earnest wish to avoid a resort to coercion; to\r\nrepresent, however, that, without submission, coercion _must_ be the\r\nresort; but to invite them, at the same time, to return to the demeanor\r\nof faithful citizens, by such accommodations as lay within the sphere of\r\nExecutive power. Pardon, too, was tendered to them by the Government of\r\nthe United States and that of Pennsylvania, upon no other condition\r\nthan a satisfactory assurance of obedience to the laws.\r\n\r\nAlthough the report of the commissioners marks their firmness and\r\nabilities, and must unite all virtuous men, by shewing that the means\r\nof conciliation have been exhausted, all of those who had committed or\r\nabetted the tumults did not subscribe the mild form which was proposed\r\nas the atonement, and the indications of a peaceable temper were neither\r\nsufficiently general nor conclusive to recommend or warrant the further\r\nsuspension of the march of the militia.\r\n\r\nThus the painful alternative could not be discarded. I ordered the\r\nmilitia to march, after once more admonishing the insurgents in my\r\nproclamation of the 25th of September last.\r\n\r\nIt was a task too difficult to ascertain with precision the lowest\r\ndegree of force competent to the quelling of the insurrection. From\r\na respect, indeed, to economy and the ease of my fellow-citizens\r\nbelonging to the militia, it would have gratified me to accomplish\r\nsuch an estimate. My very reluctance to ascribe too much importance\r\nto the opposition, had its extent been accurately seen, would have\r\nbeen a decided inducement to the smallest efficient numbers, In this\r\nuncertainty, therefore, I put into motion 15,000 men, as being an army\r\nwhich, according to all human calculation, would be prompt and adequate\r\nin every view, and might, perhaps, by rendering resistance desperate,\r\nprevent the effusion of blood. Quotas had been assigned to the States\r\nof New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, the governor of\r\nPennsylvania having declared on this occasion an opinion which justified\r\na requisition to the other States.\r\n\r\nAs commander in chief of the militia when called into the actual service\r\nof the United States, I have visited the places of general rendezvous\r\nto obtain more exact information and to direct a plan for ulterior\r\nmovements. Had there been room for a persuasion that the laws were\r\nsecure from obstruction; that the civil magistrate was able to bring to\r\njustice such of the most culpable as have not embraced the proffered\r\nterms of amnesty, and may be deemed fit objects of example; that the\r\nfriends to peace and good government were not in need of that aid and\r\ncountenance which they ought always to receive, and, I trust, ever will\r\nreceive, against the vicious and turbulent, I should have caught with\r\navidity the opportunity of restoring the militia to their families and\r\nhomes. But succeeding intelligence has tended to manifest the necessity\r\nof what has been done, it being now confessed by those who were not\r\ninclined to exaggerate the ill conduct of the insurgents that their\r\nmalevolence was not pointed merely to a particular law, but that a\r\nspirit inimical to all order has actuated many of the offenders. If the\r\nstate of things had afforded reason for the continuance of my presence\r\nwith the army, it would not have been withholden. But every appearance\r\nassuring such an issue as will redound to the reputation and strength\r\nof the United States, I have judged it most proper to resume my duties\r\nat the seat of Government, leaving the chief command with the governor\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\nStill, however, as it is probable that in a commotion like the present,\r\nwhatsoever may be the pretense, the purposes of mischief and revenge may\r\nnot be laid aside, the stationing of a small force for a certain period\r\nin the four western counties of Pennsylvania will be indispensable,\r\nwhether we contemplate the situation of those who are connected with the\r\nexecution of the laws or of others who may have exposed themselves by an\r\nhonorable attachment to them. Thirty days from the commencement of this\r\nsession being the legal limitation of the employment of the militia,\r\nCongress can not be too early occupied with this subject.\r\n\r\nAmong the discussions which may arise from this aspect of our affairs,\r\nand from the documents which will be submitted to Congress, it will not\r\nescape their observation that not only the inspector of the revenue,\r\nbut other officers of the United States in Pennsylvania have, from\r\ntheir fidelity in the discharge of their functions, sustained material\r\ninjuries to their property. The obligation and policy of indemnifying\r\nthem are strong and obvious. It may also merit attention whether policy\r\nwill not enlarge this provision to the retribution of other citizens\r\nwho, though not under the ties of office, may have suffered damage by\r\ntheir generous exertions for upholding the Constitution and the laws.\r\nThe amount, even if all the injured were included, would not be great,\r\nand on future emergencies the Government would be amply repaid by the\r\ninfluence of an example that he who incurs a loss in its defense shall\r\nfind a recompense in its liberality.\r\n\r\nWhile there is cause to lament that occurrences of this nature should\r\nhave disgraced the name or interrupted the tranquillity of any part of\r\nour community, or should have diverted to a new application any portion\r\nof the public resources, there are not wanting real and substantial\r\nconsolations for the misfortune. It has demonstrated that our prosperity\r\nrests on solid foundations, by furnishing an additional proof that my\r\nfellow-citizens understand the true principles of government and\r\nliberty; that they feel their inseparable union; that notwithstanding\r\nall the devices which have been used to sway them from their interest\r\nand duty, they are now as ready to maintain the authority of the laws\r\nagainst licentious invasions as they were to defend their rights\r\nagainst usurpation. It has been a spectacle displaying to the highest\r\nadvantage the value of republican government to behold the most and\r\nthe least wealthy of our citizens standing in the same ranks as\r\nprivate soldiers, preeminently distinguished by being the army of the\r\nConstitution--undeterred by a march of 300 miles over rugged mountains,\r\nby the approach of an inclement season, or by any other discouragement.\r\nNor ought I to omit to acknowledge the efficacious and patriotic\r\ncooperation which I have experienced from the chief magistrates\r\nof the States to which my requisitions have been addressed.\r\n\r\nTo every description of citizens, indeed, let praise be given. But\r\nlet them persevere in their affectionate vigilance over that precious\r\ndepository of American happiness, the Constitution of the United States.\r\nLet them cherish it, too, for the sake of those who, from every clime,\r\nare daily seeking a dwelling in our land. And when in the calm moments\r\nof reflection they shall have retraced the origin and progress of the\r\ninsurrection, let them determine whether it has not been fomented by\r\ncombinations of men who, careless of consequences and disregarding the\r\nunerring truth that those who rouse can not always appease a civil\r\nconvulsion, have disseminated, from an ignorance or perversion of facts,\r\nsuspicions, jealousies, and accusations of the whole Government.\r\n\r\nHaving thus fulfilled the engagement which I took when I entered into\r\noffice, \"to the best of my ability to preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution of the United States,\" on you, gentlemen, and the people\r\nby whom you are deputed, I rely for support.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangements to which the possibility of a similar contingency\r\nwill naturally draw your attention it ought not to be forgotten that the\r\nmilitia laws have exhibited such striking defects as could not have been\r\nsupplied but by the zeal of our citizens, Besides the extraordinary\r\nexpense and waste, which are not the least of the defects, every appeal\r\nto those laws is attended with a doubt on its success.\r\n\r\nThe devising and establishing of a well-regulated militia would be\r\na genuine source of legislative honor and a perfect title to public\r\ngratitude. I therefore entertain a hope that the present session will\r\nnot pass without carrying to its full energy the power of organizing,\r\narming, and disciplining the militia, and thus providing, in the\r\nlanguage of the Constitution, for calling them forth to execute the\r\nlaws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.\r\n\r\nAs auxiliary to the state of our defense, to which Congress can never\r\ntoo frequently recur, they will not omit to inquire whether the\r\nfortifications which have been already licensed by law be commensurate\r\nwith our exigencies.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence from the army under the command of General Wayne is a\r\nhappy presage to our military operations against the hostile Indians\r\nnorth of the Ohio. From the advices which have been forwarded, the\r\nadvance which he has made must have damped the ardor of the savages and\r\nweakened their obstinacy in waging war against the United States, And\r\nyet, even at this late hour, when our power to punish them can not be\r\nquestioned, we shall not be unwilling to cement a lasting peace upon\r\nterms of candor, equity, and good neighborhood.\r\n\r\nToward none of the Indian tribes have overtures of friendship been\r\nspared. The Creeks in particular are covered from encroachment by the\r\ninterposition of the General Government and that of Georgia. From a\r\ndesire also to remove the discontents of the Six Nations, a settlement\r\nmeditated at Presque Isle, on Lake Erie, has been suspended, and an\r\nagent is now endeavoring to rectify any misconception into which they\r\nmay have fallen. But I can not refrain from again pressing upon your\r\ndeliberations the plan which I recommended at the last session for the\r\nimprovement of harmony with all the Indians within our limits by the\r\nfixing and conducting of trading houses upon the principles then\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe time which has elapsed since the commencement of our fiscal measures\r\nhas developed our pecuniary resources so as to open the way for a\r\ndefinite plan for the redemption of the public debt. It is believed that\r\nthe result is such as to encourage Congress to consummate this work\r\nwithout delay. Nothing can more promote the permanent welfare of the\r\nnation and nothing would be more grateful to our constituents. Indeed,\r\nwhatsoever is unfinished of our system of public credit can not be\r\nbenefited by procrastination; and as far as may be practicable we ought\r\nto place that credit on grounds which can not be disturbed, and to\r\nprevent that progressive accumulation of debt which must ultimately\r\nendanger all governments.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the necessary appropriations, including the expenditures\r\ninto which we have been driven by the insurrection, will be submitted to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nThe Mint of the United States has entered upon the coinage of the\r\nprecious metals, and considerable sums of defective coins and bullion\r\nhave been lodged with the Director by individuals. There is a pleasing\r\nprospect that the institution will at no remote day realize the\r\nexpectation which was originally formed of its utility.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent communications certain circumstances of our\r\nintercourse with foreign nations will be transmitted to Congress.\r\nHowever, it may not be unseasonable to announce that my policy in our\r\nforeign transactions has been to cultivate peace with all the world;\r\nto observe treaties with pure and absolute faith; to check every\r\ndeviation from the line of impartiality; to explain what may have been\r\nmisapprehended and correct what may have been injurious to any nation,\r\nand having thus acquired the right, to lose no time in acquiring the\r\nability to insist upon justice being done to ourselves.\r\n\r\nLet us unite, therefore, in imploring the Supreme Ruler of Nations\r\nto spread his holy protection over these United States; to turn the\r\nmachinations of the wicked to the confirming of our Constitution; to\r\nenable us at all times to root out internal sedition and put invasion to\r\nflight; to perpetuate to our country that prosperity which His goodness\r\nhas already conferred, and to verify the anticipations of this\r\nGovernment being a safeguard to human rights.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: We receive with pleasure your speech to the two Houses of Congress.\r\nIn it we perceive renewed proofs of that vigilant and paternal concern\r\nfor the prosperity, honor, and happiness of our country which has\r\nuniformly distinguished your past Administration.\r\n\r\nOur anxiety arising from the licentious and open resistance to the\r\nlaws in the western counties of Pennsylvania has been increased by the\r\nproceedings of certain self-created societies relative to the laws and\r\nadministration of the Government; proceedings, in our apprehension,\r\nfounded in political error, calculated, if not intended, to disorganize\r\nour Government, and which, by inspiring delusive hopes of support, have\r\nbeen influential in misleading our fellow-citizens in the scene of\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nIn a situation so delicate and important the lenient and persuasive\r\nmeasures which you adopted merit and receive our affectionate\r\napprobation. These failing to procure their proper effect, and coercion\r\nhaving become inevitable, we have derived the highest satisfaction from\r\nthe enlightened patriotism and animating zeal with which the citizens of\r\nNew Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia have rallied around the\r\nstandard of Government in opposition to anarchy and insurrection.\r\n\r\nOur warm and cordial acknowledgments are due to you, sir, for the wisdom\r\nand decision with which you arrayed the militia to execute the public\r\nwill, and to them for the disinterestedness and alacrity with which they\r\nobeyed your summons.\r\n\r\nThe example is precious to the theory of our Government, and confers the\r\nbrightest honor upon the patriots who have given it.\r\n\r\nWe shall readily concur in such further provisions for the security\r\nof internal peace and a due obedience to the laws as the occasion\r\nmanifestly requires.\r\n\r\nThe effectual organization of the militia and a prudent attention to the\r\nfortifications of our ports and harbors are subjects of great national\r\nimportance, and, together with the other measures you have been pleased\r\nto recommend, will receive our deliberate consideration.\r\n\r\nThe success of the troops under the command of General Wayne can not\r\nfail to produce essential advantages. The pleasure with which we\r\nacknowledge the merits of that gallant general and army is enhanced by\r\nthe hope that their victories will lay the foundation of a just and\r\ndurable peace with the Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nAt a period so momentous in the affairs of nations the temperate, just,\r\nand firm policy that you have pursued in respect to foreign powers has\r\nbeen eminently calculated to promote the great and essential interest of\r\nour country, and has created the fairest title to the public gratitude\r\nand thanks.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS,\r\n\r\n_Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate_.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 21, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: Among the occasions which have been afforded for expressing\r\nmy sense of the zealous and steadfast cooperation of the Senate in the\r\nmaintenance of Government, none has yet occurred more forcibly demanding\r\nmy unqualified acknowledgments than the present.\r\n\r\nNext to the consciousness of upright intentions, it is the highest\r\npleasure to be approved by the enlightened representatives of a free\r\nnation. With the satisfaction, therefore, which arises from an\r\nunalterable attachment to public order do I learn that the Senate\r\ndiscountenance those proceedings which would arrogate the direction of\r\nour affairs without any degree of authority derived from the people.\r\n\r\nIt has been more than once the lot of our Government to be thrown into\r\nnew and delicate situations, and of these the insurrection has not been\r\nthe least important. Having been compelled at length to lay aside my\r\nrepugnance to resort to arms, I derive much happiness from being\r\nconfirmed by your judgment in the necessity of decisive measures, and\r\nfrom the support of my fellow-citizens of the militia, who were the\r\npatriotic instruments of that necessity.\r\n\r\nWith such demonstrations of affection for our Constitution; with an\r\nadequate organization of the militia; with the establishment of\r\nnecessary fortifications; with a continuance of those judicious and\r\nspirited exertions which have brought victory to our Western army; with\r\na due attention to public credit, and an unsullied honor toward all\r\nnations, we may meet, under every assurance of success, our enemies\r\nfrom within and from without.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 22, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The House of Representatives, calling to mind the blessings enjoyed\r\nby the people of the United States, and especially the happiness of\r\nliving under constitutions and laws which rest on their authority alone,\r\ncould not learn with other emotions than those you have expressed that\r\nany part of our fellow-citizens should have shewn themselves capable\r\nof an insurrection. And we learn with the greatest concern that any\r\nmisrepresentations whatever of the Government and its proceedings,\r\neither by individuals or combinations of men, should have been made\r\nand so far credited as to foment the flagrant outrage which has been\r\ncommitted on the laws. We feel with you the deepest regret at so painful\r\nan occurrence in the annals of our country. As men regardful of the\r\ntender interests of humanity, we look with grief at scenes which might\r\nhave stained our land with civil blood; as lovers of public order, we\r\nlament that it has suffered so flagrant a violation; as zealous friends\r\nof republican government, we deplore every occasion which in the hands\r\nof its enemies may be turned into a calumny against it.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the crisis, however, is happily not the only one which\r\nit presents. There is another, which yields all the consolations which\r\nyou have drawn from it. It has demonstrated to the candid world, as\r\nwell as to the American people themselves, that the great body of them\r\neverywhere are equally attached to the luminous and vital principle of\r\nour Constitution, which enjoins that the will of the majority shall\r\nprevail; that they understand the indissoluble union between true\r\nliberty and regular government; that they feel their duties no less than\r\nthey are watchful over their rights; that they will be as ready at all\r\ntimes to crush licentiousness as they have been to defeat usurpation.\r\nIn a word, that they are capable of carrying into execution that noble\r\nplan of self-government which they have chosen as the guaranty of their\r\nown happiness and the asylum for that of all, from every clime, who may\r\nwish to unite their destiny with ours.\r\n\r\nThese are the just inferences flowing from the promptitude with which\r\nthe summons to the standard of the laws has been obeyed, and from the\r\nsentiments which have been witnessed in every description of citizens in\r\nevery quarter of the Union. The spectacle, therefore, when viewed in its\r\ntrue light, may well be affirmed to display in equal luster the virtues\r\nof the American character and the value of republican government.\r\nAll must particularly acknowledge and applaud the patriotism of that\r\nportion of citizens who have freely sacrificed everything less dear\r\nthan the love of their country to the meritorious task of defending\r\nits happiness.\r\n\r\nIn the part which you have yourself borne through this delicate and\r\ndistressing period we trace the additional proofs it has afforded of\r\nyour solicitude for the public good. Your laudable and successful\r\nendeavors to render lenity in executing the laws conducive to their\r\nreal energy, and to convert tumult into order without the effusion of\r\nblood, form a particular title to the confidence and praise of your\r\nconstituents. In all that may be found necessary on our part to complete\r\nthis benevolent purpose, and to secure the ministers and friends of\r\nthe laws against the remains of danger, our due cooperation will\r\nbe afforded.\r\n\r\nThe other subjects which you have recommended or communicated, and of\r\nwhich several are peculiarly interesting, will all receive the attention\r\nwhich they demand. We are deeply impressed with the importance of an\r\neffectual organization of the militia. We rejoice at the intelligence\r\nof the advance and success of the army under the command of General\r\nWayne, whether we regard it as a proof of the perseverance, prowess,\r\nand superiority of our troops, or as a happy presage to our military\r\noperations against the hostile Indians, and as a probable prelude to the\r\nestablishment of a lasting peace upon terms of candor, equity, and good\r\nneighborhood. We receive it with the greater pleasure as it increases\r\nthe probability of sooner restoring a part of the public resources to\r\nthe desirable object of reducing the public debt.\r\n\r\nWe shall on this, as on all occasions, be disposed to adopt any measures\r\nwhich may advance the safety and prosperity of our country. In nothing\r\ncan we more cordially unite with you than in imploring the Supreme Ruler\r\nof Nations to multiply his blessings on these United States; to guard\r\nour free and happy Constitution against every machination and danger,\r\nand to make it the best source of public happiness, by verifying its\r\ncharacter of being the best safeguard of human rights,\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 28, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I anticipated with confidence the concurrence of the House of\r\nRepresentatives in the regret produced by the insurrection. Every effort\r\nought to be used to discountenance what has contributed to foment it,\r\nand thus discourage a repetition of like attempts; for notwithstanding\r\nthe consolations which may be drawn from the issue of this event, it\r\nis far better that the artful approaches to such a situation of things\r\nshould be checked by the vigilant and duly admonished patriotism of our\r\nfellow-citizens than that the evil should increase until it becomes\r\nnecessary to crush it by the strength of their arm.\r\n\r\nI am happy that the part which I have myself borne on this occasion\r\nreceives the approbation of your House. For the discharge of a\r\nconstitutional duty it is a sufficient reward to me to be assured\r\nthat you will unite in consummating what remains to be done.\r\n\r\nI feel also great satisfaction in learning that the other subjects\r\nwhich I have communicated or recommended will meet with due attention;\r\nthat you are deeply impressed with the importance of an effectual\r\norganization of the militia, and that the advance and success of the\r\narmy under the command of General Wayne is regarded by you, no less\r\nthan myself, as a proof of the perseverance, prowess, and superiority\r\nof our troops.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 29, 1794.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 21, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of a letter from the governor of the State\r\nof New York and of the exemplification of an act of the legislature\r\nthereof ratifying the amendment of the Constitution of the United States\r\nproposed by the Senate and House of Representatives at their last\r\nsession, respecting the judicial power.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 21, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn the negotiation between the United States and His Catholic Majesty\r\nI have received satisfactory proofs of attention and ability exerted\r\nin behalf of the United States to bring it to a happy and speedy issue.\r\nBut it is probable that by complying with an intimation made to the\r\nSecretary of State by the commissioners of His Catholic Majesty much\r\nfurther delay in concluding it may be prevented. Notwithstanding,\r\ntherefore, I retain full confidence in our minister resident at Madrid,\r\nwho is charged with powers as commissioner plenipotentiary, I nominate\r\nThomas Pinckney to be envoy extraordinary of the United States to His\r\nCatholic Majesty, for the purpose of negotiating of and concerning the\r\nnavigation of the river Mississippi, and such other matters relative\r\nto the confines of their territories, and the intercourse to be had\r\nthereon, as the mutual interests and general harmony of neighboring and\r\nfriendly nations require should be precisely adjusted and regulated,\r\nand of and concerning the general commerce between the United States\r\nand the kingdoms and dominions of his said Catholic Majesty.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that by his temporary absence from London in the\r\ndischarge of these new functions no injury will arise to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI also nominate:\r\n\r\nJohn Miller Russell, of Massachusetts, to be consul of the United States\r\nof America for the port of St. Petersburg, in Russia, and for such other\r\nplaces as shall be nearer to the said port than to the residence of\r\nany other consul or vice-consul of the United States within the same\r\nallegiance;\r\n\r\nJoseph Pitcairn, of New York, to be vice-consul of the United States\r\nof America at Paris, vice Alexander Duvernet, superseded; and\r\n\r\nNathaniel Brush, of Vermont, to be supervisor for the United States\r\nin the district of Vermont, vice Noah Smith, who has resigned.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _November 25, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a statement of the troops in the service of the United\r\nStates, which has been submitted to me by the Secretary of War. It will\r\nrest with Congress to consider and determine whether further inducements\r\nshall be held out for entering into the military service of the United\r\nStates in order to complete the establishment authorized by law.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 17, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of the journal of the proceedings of the\r\nexecutive department of the government of the United States south of\r\nthe river Ohio to the 1st of September, 1794.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 30, 1794_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you a report, made to me by the Secretary of War,\r\nrespecting the frontiers of the United States. The disorders and\r\nthe great expenses which incessantly arise upon the frontiers are\r\nof a nature and magnitude to excite the most serious considerations.\r\n\r\nI feel a confidence that Congress will devise such constitutional and\r\nefficient measures as shall be equal to the great objects of preserving\r\nour treaties with the Indian tribes and of affording an adequate\r\nprotection to our frontiers.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 2, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nA spirit of discontent, from several causes, arose in the early part of\r\nthe present year among the Six Nations of Indians, and particularly on\r\nthe ground of a projected settlement by Pennsylvania, at Presque Isle,\r\nupon Lake Erie. The papers upon this point have already been laid before\r\nCongress. It was deemed proper on my part to endeavor to tranquillize\r\nthe Indians by pacific measures. Accordingly a time and place was\r\nappointed at which a free conference should be had upon all the causes\r\nof discontent, and an agent was appointed with the instructions of\r\nwhich No. 1, herewith transmitted, is a copy.\r\n\r\nA numerous assembly of Indians was held in Canandaigua, in the State of\r\nNew York the proceedings whereof accompany this message, marked No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe two treaties, the one with the Six Nations and the other with the\r\nOneida, Tuscorora, and Stockbridge Indians dwelling in the country of\r\nthe Oneidas, which have resulted from the mission of the agent, are\r\nherewith laid before the Senate for their consideration and advice.\r\n\r\nThe original engagement of the United States to the Oneidas is also sent\r\nherewith.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 8, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress copies of acts passed by the legislatures of the\r\nStates of Vermont, Massachusetts, and New York, ratifying the amendment\r\nproposed by the Senate and House of Representatives at their last\r\nsession to the Constitution of the United States respecting the\r\njudicial power thereof.\r\n\r\nThe minister of the French Republic having communicated to the Secretary\r\nof State certain proceedings of the committee of public safety\r\nrespecting weights and measures, I lay these also before Congress.\r\n\r\nThe letter from the governor of the Western territory, copies of which\r\nare now transmitted, refers to a defect in the judicial system of that\r\nterritory deserving the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe necessary absence of the judge of the district of Pennsylvania upon\r\nbusiness connected with the late insurrection is stated by him in a\r\nletter of which I forward copies to have produced certain interruptions\r\nin the judicial proceedings of that district which can not be removed\r\nwithout the interposition of Congress.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 4, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress, for their consideration, a letter from the\r\nSecretary of State upon the subject of a loan which is extremely\r\ninteresting and urgent.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 17, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress copies of a letter from the governor of the State\r\nof New Hampshire and of an act of the legislature thereof \"ratifying the\r\narticle proposed in amendment to the Constitution of the United States\r\nrespecting the judicial power.\"\r\n\r\nI also lay before Congress copies of a letter from the governor of\r\nthe State of North Carolina and of an act of the legislature thereof\r\nceding to the United States certain lands upon the conditions therein\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 17, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received copies of two acts of the legislature of Georgia,\r\none passed on the 28th day of December and the other on the 7th day\r\nof January last, for appropriating and selling the Indian lands within\r\nthe territorial limits claimed by that State. These copies, though not\r\nofficially certified, have been transmitted to me in such a manner as to\r\nleave no room to doubt their authenticity. These acts embrace an object\r\nof such magnitude, and in their consequences may so deeply affect the\r\npeace and welfare of the United States, that I have thought it necessary\r\nnow to lay them before Congress.\r\n\r\nIn _confidence_, I also forward copies of several documents and papers\r\nreceived from the governor of the Southwestern territory. By these it\r\nseems that hostilities with the Cherokees have ceased, and that there is\r\na pleasing prospect of a permanent peace with that nation; but from all\r\nthe communications of the governor it appears that the Creeks, in small\r\nparties, continue their depredations, and it is uncertain to what they\r\nmay finally lead.\r\n\r\nThe several papers now communicated deserve the immediate attention of\r\nCongress, who will consider how far the subjects of them may require\r\ntheir cooperation.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 25, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress copies of a letter from the governor of the\r\nState of Georgia and of an act of the legislature thereof \"to ratify the\r\nresolution of Congress explanatory of the judicial power of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 28, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn my first communication to Congress during their present session\r\nI gave them reason to expect that \"certain circumstances of our\r\nintercourse with foreign nations\" would be transmitted to them. There\r\nwas at that time every assurance for believing that some of the most\r\nimportant of our foreign affairs would have been concluded and others\r\nconsiderably matured before they should rise. But notwithstanding I have\r\nwaited until this moment, it has so happened that, either from causes\r\nunknown to me or from events which could not be controlled, I am yet\r\nunable to execute my original intention. That I may, however, fulfill\r\nthe expectation given as far as the actual situation of things will in\r\nmy judgment permit, I now, _in confidence_', lay before Congress the\r\nfollowing general statement:\r\n\r\nOur minister near the French Republic has urged compensation for\r\nthe injuries which our commerce has sustained from captures by French\r\ncruisers, from the nonfulfillment of the contracts of the agents of that\r\nRepublic with our citizens, and from the embargo at Bordeaux. He has\r\nalso pressed an allowance for the money voted by Congress for relieving\r\nthe inhabitants of St. Domingo. It affords me the highest pleasure to\r\ninform Congress that perfect harmony reigns between the two Republics,\r\nand that those claims are in a train of being discussed with candor\r\nand of being amicably adjusted.\r\n\r\nSo much of our relation to Great Britain may depend upon the result\r\nof our late negotiations in London that until that result shall arrive\r\nI can not undertake to make any communication upon this subject.\r\n\r\nAfter the negotiation with Spain had been long depending unusual and\r\nunexpected embarrassments were raised to interrupt its progress. But\r\nthe commissioner of His Catholic Majesty near the United States having\r\ndeclared to the Secretary of State that if a particular accommodation\r\nshould be made in the _conducting_ of the business no further delay\r\nwould ensue, I thought proper, under all circumstances, to send to\r\nHis Catholic Majesty an envoy extraordinary specially charged to bring\r\nto a conclusion the discussions which have been formerly announced\r\nto Congress.\r\n\r\nThe friendship of Her Most Faithful Majesty has been often manifested in\r\nchecking the passage of the Algerine corsairs into the Atlantic Ocean.\r\nShe has also furnished occasional convoys to the vessels of the United\r\nStates, even when bound to other ports than her own. We may therefore\r\npromise ourselves that, as in the ordinary course of things few causes\r\ncan exist for dissatisfaction between the United States and Portugal,\r\nso the temper with which accidental difficulties will be met on each\r\nside will speedily remove them.\r\n\r\nBetween the Executive of the United States and the Government of the\r\nUnited Netherlands but little intercourse has taken place during the\r\nlast year. It may be acceptable to Congress to learn that our credit in\r\nHolland is represented as standing upon the most respectable footing.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of the late Emperor of Morocco an agent was dispatched\r\nto renew with his successor the treaty which the United States had made\r\nwith _him_. The agent, unfortunately, died after he had reached Europe\r\nin the prosecution of his mission. But until lately it was impossible\r\nto determine with any degree of probability who of the competitors for\r\nthat Empire would be ultimately fixed in the supreme power. Although\r\nthe measures which have been since adopted for the renewal of the treaty\r\nhave been obstructed by the disturbed situation of Amsterdam, there are\r\ngood grounds for presuming as yet upon the pacific disposition of the\r\nEmperor, in fact, toward the United States, and that the past\r\nmiscarriage will be shortly remedied.\r\n\r\nCongress are already acquainted with the failure of the loan attempted\r\nin Holland for the relief of our unhappy fellow-citizens in Algiers.\r\nThis subject, than which none deserves a more affectionate zeal, has\r\nconstantly commanded my best exertions. I am happy, therefore, in being\r\nable to say that from the last authentic accounts the Dey was disposed\r\nto treat for a peace and ransom, and that both would in all probability\r\nhave been accomplished had we not been disappointed in the means.\r\nNothing which depends upon the Executive shall be left undone for\r\ncarrying into immediate effect the supplementary act of Congress.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 2, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt appears from the information which I have lately received that it may\r\nbe probably necessary to the more successful conduct of our affairs on\r\nthe coast of Barbary that one consul should reside in Morocco, another\r\nin Algiers, and a third in Tunis or Tripoli. As no appointment for these\r\noffices will be accepted without some emolument annexed, I submit to the\r\nconsideration of Congress whether it may not be advisable to authorize\r\na stipend to be allowed to two consuls for that coast in addition to the\r\none already existing.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 2, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to you copies of a letter from the governor of the State\r\nof Delaware and of an act inclosed \"declaring the assent of that State\r\nto an amendment therein mentioned to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 8, 1795_.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For proclamation convening Senate in extraordinary session\r\nsee p. 587.]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of my nomination of John Jay as envoy extraordinary to His\r\nBritannic Majesty on the 16th day of April, 1794, and of the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate thereto on the 19th, a negotiation was opened in\r\nLondon. On the 7th of March, 1795, the treaty resulting therefrom was\r\ndelivered to the Secretary of State. I now transmit to the Senate that\r\ntreaty and other documents connected with it. They will, therefore, in\r\ntheir wisdom decide whether they will advise and consent that the said\r\ntreaty be made between the United States and His Britannic Majesty.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 25, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIt has been represented by our minister plenipotentiary near the French\r\nRepublic that such of our commercial relations with France as may\r\nrequire the support of the United States in _detail_ can not be well\r\nexecuted without a consul-general. Of this I am satisfied when I\r\nconsider the extent of the mercantile claims now depending before the\r\nFrench Government, the necessity of bringing into the hands of one agent\r\nthe various applications to the several committees of administration\r\nresiding at Paris, the attention which must be paid to the conduct of\r\nconsuls, and vice-consuls, and the nature of the services which are the\r\npeculiar objects of a minister's care, and leave no leisure for his\r\nintervention in business to which consular functions are competent.\r\nI therefore nominate Fulwar Skipwith to be consul-general of the\r\nUnited States in France.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _June 25, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nJust at the close of the last session of Congress I received from one\r\nof the Senators and one of the Representatives of the State of Georgia\r\nan application for a treaty to be held with the tribes or nations of\r\nIndians claiming the right of soil to certain lands lying beyond the\r\npresent temporary boundary line of that State, and which were described\r\nin an act of the legislature of Georgia passed on the 28th of December\r\nlast, which has already been laid before the Senate. This application\r\nand the subsequent correspondence with the governor of Georgia are\r\nherewith transmitted. The subject being very important, I thought proper\r\nto postpone a decision upon that application. The views I have since\r\ntaken of the matter, with the information received of a more pacific\r\ndisposition on the part of the Creeks, have induced me now to accede to\r\nthe request, but with this explicit declaration, that neither my assent\r\nnor the treaty which may be made shall be considered as affecting any\r\nquestion which may arise upon the supplementary act passed by the\r\nlegislature of the State of Georgia on the 7th of January last, upon\r\nwhich inquiries have been instituted in pursuance of a resolution\r\nof the Senate and House of Representatives, and that any cession or\r\nrelinquishment of the Indian claims shall be made in the general terms\r\nof the treaty of New York, which are contemplated as the form proper to\r\nbe generally used on such occasions, and on the condition that one-half\r\nof the expense of the supplies of provisions for the Indians assembled\r\nat the treaty be borne by the State of Georgia.\r\n\r\nHaving concluded to hold the treaty requested by that State, I was\r\nwilling to embrace the opportunity it would present of inquiring\r\ninto the causes of the dissatisfaction of the Creeks which has\r\nbeen manifested since the treaty of New York by their numerous\r\nand distressing depredations on our Southwestern frontiers. Their\r\ndepredations on the Cumberland have been so frequent and so peculiarly\r\ndestructive as to lead me to think they must originate in some claim to\r\nthe lands upon that river. But whatever may have been the cause, it is\r\nimportant to trace it to its source; for, independent of the destruction\r\nof lives and property, it occasions a very serious annual expense to the\r\nUnited States. The commissioners for holding the proposed treaty will,\r\ntherefore, be instructed to inquire into the causes of the hostilities\r\nto which I have referred, and to enter into such reasonable stipulations\r\nas will remove them and give permanent peace to those parts of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI now nominate Benjamin Hawkins, of North Carolina: George Clymer, of\r\nPennsylvania, and Andrew Pickens, of South Carolina, to be commissioners\r\nto hold a treaty with the Creek Nation of Indians, for the purposes\r\nhereinbefore expressed.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhen we review the calamities which afflict so many other nations,\r\nthe present condition of the United States affords much matter of\r\nconsolation and satisfaction. Our exemption hitherto from foreign war,\r\nan increasing prospect of the continuance of that exemption, the great\r\ndegree of internal tranquillity we have enjoyed, the recent confirmation\r\nof that tranquillity by the suppression of an insurrection which so\r\nwantonly threatened it, the happy course of our public affairs in\r\ngeneral, the unexampled prosperity of all classes of our citizens,\r\nare circumstances which peculiarly mark our situation with indications\r\nof the Divine beneficence toward us. In such a state of things it is\r\nin an especial manner our duty as a people, with devout reverence and\r\naffectionate gratitude, to acknowledge our many and great obligations\r\nto Almighty God and to implore Him to continue and confirm the blessings\r\nwe experience.\r\n\r\nDeeply penetrated with this sentiment, I, George Washington, President\r\nof the United States, do recommend to all religious societies and\r\ndenominations, and to all persons whomsoever, within the United States\r\nto set apart and observe Thursday, the 19th day of February next, as a\r\nday of public thanksgiving and prayer, and on that day to meet together\r\nand render their sincere and hearty thanks to the Great Ruler of Nations\r\nfor the manifold and signal mercies which distinguish our lot as a\r\nnation, particularly for the possession of constitutions of government\r\nwhich unite and by their union establish liberty with order; for the\r\npreservation of our peace, foreign and domestic; for the seasonable\r\ncontrol which has been given to a spirit of disorder in the suppression\r\nof the late insurrection, and generally, for the prosperous course\r\nof our affairs, public and private; and at the same time humbly and\r\nfervently to beseech the kind Author of these blessings graciously to\r\nprolong them to us; to imprint on our hearts a deep and solemn sense of\r\nour obligations to Him for them; to teach us rightly to estimate their\r\nimmense value; to preserve us from the arrogance of prosperity, and\r\nfrom hazarding the advantages we enjoy by delusive pursuits; to dispose\r\nus to merit the continuance of His favors by not abusing them; by our\r\ngratitude for them, and by a correspondent conduct as citizens and men;\r\nto render this country more and more a safe and propitious asylum for\r\nthe unfortunate of other countries; to extend among us true and useful\r\nknowledge; to diffuse and establish habits of sobriety, order, morality,\r\nand piety, and finally, to impart all the blessings we possess, or ask\r\nfor ourselves, to the whole family of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States of\r\nAmerica to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with\r\nmy hand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Philadelphia, the 1st day of January, 1795, and\r\nof the Independence of the United States of America the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  EDM. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Sparks's Washington, Vol. XII, p. 134.]\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas the commissioners appointed by the President of the United\r\nStates to confer with the citizens in the western counties of\r\nPennsylvania during the late insurrection which prevailed therein, by\r\ntheir act and agreement bearing date the 2d day of September last, in\r\npursuance of the powers in them vested, did promise and engage that,\r\nif assurances of submission to the laws of the United States should\r\nbe bona fide given by the citizens resident in the fourth survey of\r\nPennsylvania, in the manner and within the time in the said act and\r\nagreement specified, a general pardon should be granted on the 10th day\r\nof July then next ensuing of all treasons and other indictable offenses\r\nagainst the United States committed within the said survey before the\r\n22d day of August last, excluding therefrom, nevertheless, every person\r\nwho should refuse or neglect to subscribe such assurance and engagement\r\nin manner aforesaid, or who should after such subscription violate the\r\nsame, or willfully obstruct or attempt to obstruct the execution of the\r\nacts for raising a revenue on distilled spirits and stills, or be aiding\r\nor abetting therein; and\r\n\r\nWhereas I have since thought proper to extend the said pardon to\r\nall persons guilty of the said treasons, misprisions of treasons, or\r\notherwise concerned in the late insurrection within the survey aforesaid\r\nwho have not since been indicted or convicted thereof, or of any other\r\noffense against the United States:\r\n\r\nTherefore be it known that I, George Washington, President of the said\r\nUnited States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full,\r\nfree, and entire pardon to all persons (excepting as is hereinafter\r\nexcepted) of all treasons, misprisions of treason, and other indictable\r\noffenses against the United States committed within the fourth survey of\r\nPennsylvania before the said 22d day of August last past, excepting and\r\nexcluding therefrom, nevertheless, every person who refused or neglected\r\nto give and subscribe the said assurances in the manner aforesaid\r\n(or having subscribed hath violated the same) and now standeth indicted\r\nor convicted of any treason, misprision of treason, or other offense\r\nagainst the said United States, hereby remitting and releasing unto all\r\npersons, except as before excepted, all penalties incurred, or supposed\r\nto be incurred, for or on account of the premises.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed, this 10th day of July, A.D. 1795, and\r\nthe twentieth year of the Independence of the said United States.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH ANNUAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 8, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI trust I do not deceive myself when I indulge the persuasion that\r\nI have never met you at any period when more than at the present the\r\nsituation of our public affairs has afforded just cause for mutual\r\ncongratulation, and for inviting you to join with me in profound\r\ngratitude to the Author of all Good for the numerous and extraordinary\r\nblessings we enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe termination of the long, expensive, and distressing war in which we\r\nhave been engaged with certain Indians northwest of the Ohio is placed\r\nin the option of the United States by a treaty which the commander of\r\nour army has concluded provisionally with the hostile tribes in that\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nIn the adjustment of the terms the satisfaction of the Indians was\r\ndeemed an object worthy no less of the policy than of the liberality of\r\nthe United States as the necessary basis of durable tranquillity. The\r\nobject, it is believed, has been fully attained. The articles agreed\r\nupon will immediately be laid before the Senate for their consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Creek and Cherokee Indians, who alone of the Southern tribes had\r\nannoyed our frontiers, have lately confirmed their preexisting treaties\r\nwith us, and were giving evidence of a sincere disposition to carry them\r\ninto effect by the surrender of the prisoners and property they had\r\ntaken. But we have to lament that the fair prospect in this quarter has\r\nbeen once more clouded by wanton murders, which some citizens of Georgia\r\nare represented to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the\r\nCreeks, which have again subjected that frontier to disquietude and\r\ndanger, which will be productive of further expense, and may occasion\r\nmore effusion of blood. Measures are pursuing to prevent or mitigate\r\nthe usual consequences of such outrages, and with the hope of their\r\nsucceeding at least to avert general hostility.\r\n\r\nA letter from the Emperor of Morocco announces to me his recognition of\r\nour treaty made with his father, the late Emperor, and consequently the\r\ncontinuance of peace with that power. With peculiar satisfaction I add\r\nthat information has been received from an agent deputed on our part to\r\nAlgiers importing that the terms of the treaty with the Dey and Regency\r\nof that country had been adjusted in such a manner as to authorize the\r\nexpectation of a speedy peace and the restoration of our unfortunate\r\nfellow-citizens from a grievous captivity.\r\n\r\nThe latest advices from our envoy at the Court of Madrid give, moreover,\r\nthe pleasing information that he had received assurances of a speedy and\r\nsatisfactory conclusion of his negotiation. While the event depending\r\nupon unadjusted particulars can not be regarded as ascertained, it\r\nis agreeable to cherish the expectation of an issue which, securing\r\namicably very essential interests of the United States, will at the same\r\ntime lay the foundation of lasting harmony with a power whose friendship\r\nwe have uniformly and sincerely desired to cultivate.\r\n\r\nThough not before officially disclosed to the House of Representatives,\r\nyou, gentlemen, are all apprised that a treaty of amity, commerce, and\r\nnavigation has been negotiated with Great Britain, and that the Senate\r\nhave advised and consented to its ratification upon a condition which\r\nexcepts part of one article. Agreeably thereto, and to the best judgment\r\nI was able to form of the public interest after full and mature\r\ndeliberation, I have added my sanction. The result on the part of His\r\nBritannic Majesty is unknown. When received, the subject will without\r\ndelay be placed before Congress.\r\n\r\nThis interesting summary of our affairs with regard to the foreign\r\npowers between whom and the United States controversies have subsisted,\r\nand with regard also to those of our Indian neighbors with whom we have\r\nbeen in a state of enmity or misunderstanding, opens a wide field for\r\nconsoling and gratifying reflections. If by prudence and moderation\r\non every side the extinguishment of all the causes of external discord\r\nwhich have heretofore menaced our tranquillity, on terms compatible\r\nwith our national rights and honor, shall be the happy result, how firm\r\nand how precious a foundation will have been laid for accelerating,\r\nmaturing, and establishing the prosperity of our country.\r\n\r\nContemplating the internal situation as well as the external\r\nrelations of the United States, we discover equal cause for contentment\r\nand satisfaction. While many of the nations of Europe, with their\r\nAmerican dependencies, have been involved in a contest unusually bloody,\r\nexhausting, and calamitous, in which the evils of foreign war have been\r\naggravated by domestic convulsion and insurrection; in which many of\r\nthe arts most useful to society have been exposed to discouragement and\r\ndecay; in which scarcity of subsistence has imbittered other sufferings;\r\nwhile even the anticipations of a return of the blessings of peace and\r\nrepose are alloyed by the sense of heavy and accumulating burthens,\r\nwhich press upon all the departments of industry and threaten to clog\r\nthe future springs of government, our favored country, happy in a\r\nstriking contrast, has enjoyed general tranquillity--a tranquillity\r\nthe more satisfactory because maintained at the expense of no duty.\r\nFaithful to ourselves, we have violated no obligation to others. Our\r\nagriculture, commerce, and manufactures prosper beyond former example,\r\nthe molestations of our trade (to prevent a continuance of which,\r\nhowever, very pointed remonstrances have been made) being overbalanced\r\nby the aggregate benefits which it derives from a neutral position. Our\r\npopulation advances with a celerity which, exceeding the most sanguine\r\ncalculations, proportionally augments our strength and resources,\r\nand guarantees our future security. Every part of the Union displays\r\nindications of rapid and various improvement; and with burthens so\r\nlight as scarcely to be perceived, with resources fully adequate to our\r\npresent exigencies, with governments founded on the genuine principles\r\nof rational liberty, and with mild and wholesome laws, is it too much\r\nto say that our country exhibits a spectacle of national happiness\r\nnever surpassed, if ever before equaled?\r\n\r\nPlaced in a situation every way so auspicious, motives of commanding\r\nforce impel us, with sincere acknowledgment to Heaven and pure love to\r\nour country, to unite our efforts to preserve, prolong, and improve our\r\nimmense advantages. To cooperate with you in this desirable work is a\r\nfervent and favorite wish of my heart.\r\n\r\nIt is a valuable ingredient in the general estimate of our welfare that\r\nthe part of our country which was lately the scene of disorder and\r\ninsurrection now enjoys the blessings of quiet and order. The misled\r\nhave abandoned their errors, and pay the respect to our Constitution and\r\nlaws which is due from good citizens to the public authorities of the\r\nsociety. These circumstances have induced me to pardon generally the\r\noffenders here referred to, and to extend forgiveness to those who had\r\nbeen adjudged to capital punishment. For though I shall always think it\r\na sacred duty to exercise with firmness and energy the constitutional\r\npowers with which I am vested, yet it appears to me no less consistent\r\nwith the public good than it is with my personal feelings to mingle in\r\nthe operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness\r\nwhich the national justice, dignity, and safety may permit.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: Among the objects which will claim your attention in the\r\ncourse of the session, a review of our military establishment is not the\r\nleast important. It is called for by the events which have changed, and\r\nmaybe expected still further to change, the relative situation of our\r\nfrontiers. In this review you will doubtless allow due weight to the\r\nconsiderations that the questions between us and certain foreign powers\r\nare not yet finally adjusted, that the war in Europe is not yet\r\nterminated, and that our Western posts, when recovered, will demand\r\nprovision for garrisoning and securing them. A statement of our present\r\nmilitary force will be laid before you by the Department of War.\r\n\r\nWith the review of our Army establishment is naturally connected that of\r\nthe militia. It will merit inquiry what imperfections in the existing\r\nplan further experience may have unfolded. The subject is of so much\r\nmoment in my estimation as to excite a constant solicitude that the\r\nconsideration of it may be renewed until the greatest attainable\r\nperfection shall be accomplished. Time is wearing away some advantages\r\nfor forwarding the object, while none better deserves the persevering\r\nattention of the public councils.\r\n\r\nWhile we indulge the satisfaction which the actual condition of our\r\nWestern borders so well authorizes, it is necessary that we should\r\nnot lose sight of an important truth which continually receives new\r\nconfirmations, namely, that the provisions heretofore made with a view\r\nto the protection of the Indians from the violences of the lawless part\r\nof our frontier inhabitants are insufficient. It is demonstrated that\r\nthese violences can now be perpetrated with impunity, and it can need no\r\nargument to prove that unless the murdering of Indians can be restrained\r\nby bringing the murderers to condign punishment, all the exertions of\r\nthe Government to prevent destructive retaliations by the Indians will\r\nprove fruitless and all our present agreeable prospects illusory. The\r\nfrequent destruction of innocent women and children, who are chiefly the\r\nvictims of retaliation, must continue to shock humanity, and an enormous\r\nexpense to drain the Treasury of the Union.\r\n\r\nTo enforce upon the Indians the observance of justice it is\r\nindispensable that there shall be competent means of rendering justice\r\nto them. If these means can be devised by the wisdom of Congress, and\r\nespecially if there can be added an adequate provision for supplying the\r\nnecessities of the Indians on reasonable terms (a measure the mention\r\nof which I the more readily repeat, as in all the conferences with them\r\nthey urge it with solicitude), I should not hesitate to entertain a\r\nstrong hope of rendering our tranquillity permanent. I add with pleasure\r\nthat the probability even of their civilization is not diminished by\r\nthe experiments which have been thus far made under the auspices of\r\nGovernment. The accomplishment of this work, if practicable, will\r\nreflect undecaying luster on our national character and administer\r\nthe most grateful consolations that virtuous minds can know.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe state of our revenue, with the sums which have been borrowed and\r\nreimbursed pursuant to different acts of Congress, will be submitted\r\nfrom the proper Department, together with an estimate of the\r\nappropriations necessary to be made for the service of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nWhether measures may not be advisable to reenforce the provision for the\r\nredemption of the public debt will naturally engage your examination.\r\nCongress have demonstrated their sense to be, and it were superfluous\r\nto repeat mine, that whatsoever will tend to accelerate the honorable\r\nextinction of our public debt accords as much with the true interest\r\nof our country as with the general sense of our constituents.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe statements which will be laid before you relative to the Mint will\r\nshew the situation of that institution and the necessity of some further\r\nlegislative provisions for carrying the business of it more completely\r\ninto effect, and for checking abuses which appear to be arising in\r\nparticular quarters.\r\n\r\nThe progress in providing materials for the frigates and in building\r\nthem, the state of the fortifications of our harbors, the measures which\r\nhave been pursued for obtaining proper sites for arsenals and for\r\nreplenishing our magazines with military stores, and the steps which\r\nhave been taken toward the execution of the law for opening a trade with\r\nthe Indians will likewise be presented for the information of Congress.\r\n\r\nTemperate discussion of the important subjects which may arise in the\r\ncourse of the session and mutual forbearance where there is a difference\r\nof opinion are too obvious and necessary for the peace, happiness, and\r\nwelfare of our country to need any recommendation of mine.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: It is with peculiar satisfaction that we are informed by your\r\nspeech to the two Houses of Congress that the long and expensive war in\r\nwhich we have been engaged with the Indians northwest of the Ohio is in\r\na situation to be finally terminated; and though we view with concern\r\nthe danger of an interruption of the peace so recently confirmed with\r\nthe Creeks, we indulge the hope that the measures that you have adopted\r\nto prevent the same, if followed by those legislative provisions\r\nthat justice and humanity equally demand, will succeed in laying the\r\nfoundation of a lasting peace with the Indian tribes on the Southern\r\nas well as on the Western frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe confirmation of our treaty with Morocco, and the adjustment of\r\na treaty of peace with Algiers, in consequence of which our captive\r\nfellow-citizens shall be delivered from slavery, are events that will\r\nprove no less interesting to the public humanity than they will be\r\nimportant in extending and securing the navigation and commerce of\r\nour country.\r\n\r\nAs a just and equitable conclusion of our depending negotiations with\r\nSpain will essentially advance the interest of both nations, and thereby\r\ncherish and confirm the good understanding and friendship which we have\r\nat all times desired to maintain, it will afford us real pleasure to\r\nreceive an early confirmation of our expectations on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe interesting prospect of our affairs with regard to the foreign\r\npowers between whom and the United States controversies have subsisted\r\nis not more satisfactory than the review of our internal situation.\r\nIf from the former we derive an expectation of the extinguishment of\r\nall the causes of external discord that have heretofore endangered\r\nour tranquillity, and on terms consistent with our national honor\r\nand safety, in the latter we discover those numerous and widespread\r\ntokens of prosperity which in so peculiar a manner distinguish our\r\nhappy country.\r\n\r\nCircumstances thus every way auspicious demand our gratitude and sincere\r\nacknowledgments to Almighty God, and require that we should unite our\r\nefforts in imitation of your enlightened, firm, and persevering example\r\nto establish and preserve the peace, freedom, and prosperity of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe objects which you have recommended to the notice of the Legislature\r\nwill in the course of the session receive our careful attention, and\r\nwith a true zeal for the public welfare we shall cheerfully cooperate\r\nin every measure that shall appear to us best calculated to promote\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS,\r\n\r\n_Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate_.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 11, 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: With real pleasure I receive your address, recognizing\r\nthe prosperous situation of our public affairs, and giving assurances\r\nof your careful attention to the objects demanding legislative\r\nconsideration, and that with a true zeal for the public welfare you\r\nwill cheerfully cooperate in every measure which shall appear to you\r\nbest calculated to promote the same.\r\n\r\nBut I derive peculiar satisfaction from your concurrence with me in\r\nthe expressions of gratitude to Almighty God, which a review of the\r\nauspicious circumstances that distinguish our happy country have\r\nexcited, and I trust the sincerity of our acknowledgments will be\r\nevinced by a union of efforts to establish and preserve its peace,\r\nfreedom, and prosperity.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 12, 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: As the Representatives of the people of the United States, we can\r\nnot but participate in the strongest sensibility to every blessing which\r\nthey enjoy, and cheerfully join with you in profound gratitude to the\r\nAuthor of all Good for the numerous and extraordinary blessings which\r\nHe has conferred on our favored country.\r\n\r\nA final and formal termination of the distressing war which has\r\nravaged our Northwestern frontier will be an event which must afford a\r\nsatisfaction proportionate to the anxiety with which it has long been\r\nsought, and in the adjustment of the terms we perceive the true policy\r\nof making them satisfactory to the Indians as well as to the United\r\nStates as the best basis of a durable tranquillity. The disposition of\r\nsuch of the Southern tribes as had also heretofore annoyed our frontier\r\nis another prospect in our situation so important to the interest and\r\nhappiness of the United States that it is much to be lamented that any\r\nclouds should be thrown over it, more especially by excesses on the\r\npart of our own citizens.\r\n\r\nWhile our population is advancing with a celerity which exceeds the most\r\nsanguine calculations; while every part of the United States displays\r\nindications of rapid and various improvement; while we are in the\r\nenjoyment of protection and security by mild and wholesome laws,\r\nadministered by governments founded on the genuine principles of\r\nrational liberty, a secure foundation will be laid for accelerating,\r\nmaturing, and establishing the prosperity of our country if, by treaty\r\nand amicable negotiation, all those causes of external discord which\r\nheretofore menaced our tranquillity shall be extinguished on terms\r\ncompatible with our national rights and honor and with our Constitution\r\nand great commercial interests.\r\n\r\nAmong the various circumstances in our internal situation none can be\r\nviewed with more satisfaction and exultation than that the late scene of\r\ndisorder and insurrection has been completely restored to the enjoyment\r\nof order and repose. Such a triumph of reason and of law is worthy of\r\nthe free Government under which it happened, and was justly to be hoped\r\nfrom the enlightened and patriotic spirit which pervades and actuates\r\nthe people of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating that spectacle of national happiness which our\r\ncountry exhibits, and of which you, sir, have been pleased to make an\r\ninteresting summary, permit us to acknowledge and declare the very great\r\nshare which your zealous and faithful services have contributed to it,\r\nand to express the affectionate attachment which we feel for your\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe several interesting subjects which you recommend to our\r\nconsideration will receive every degree of attention which is due\r\nto them; and whilst we feel the obligation of temperance and mutual\r\nindulgence in all our discussions, we trust and pray that the result\r\nto the happiness and welfare of our country may correspond with the\r\npure affection we bear to it.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 16, 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: Coming as you do from all parts of the United States,\r\nI receive great satisfaction from the concurrence of your testimony\r\nin the justness of the interesting summary of our national happiness\r\nwhich, as the result of my inquiries, I presented to your view. The\r\nsentiments we have mutually expressed of profound gratitude to the\r\nsource of those numerous blessings, the Author of all Good, are pledges\r\nof our obligations to unite our sincere and zealous endeavors, as the\r\ninstruments of Divine Providence, to preserve and perpetuate them.\r\n\r\nAccept, gentlemen, my thanks for your declaration that to my agency you\r\nascribe the enjoyment of a great share of these benefits. So far as my\r\nservices contribute to the happiness of my country, the acknowledgment\r\nthereof by my fellow-citizens and their affectionate attachment will\r\never prove an abundant reward.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 17, 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 9, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you, for your consideration, a treaty of peace which has\r\nbeen negotiated by General Wayne, on behalf of the United States, with\r\nall the late hostile tribes of Indians northwest of the river Ohio,\r\ntogether with the instructions which were given to General Wayne and\r\nthe proceedings at the place of treaty.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 21, 1795_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nHerewith I transmit, for your information and consideration, the\r\noriginal letter from the Emperor of Morocco, recognizing the treaty of\r\npeace and friendship between the United States and his father, the late\r\nEmperor, accompanied with a translation thereof, and various documents\r\nrelating to the negotiation by which the recognition was effected.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 4, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nA letter from the minister plenipotentiary of the French Republic,\r\nreceived on the 22d of the last month, covered an address, dated the\r\n21st of October, 1794, from the committee of public safety to the\r\nRepresentatives of the United States in Congress, and also informed me\r\nthat he was instructed by the committee to present to the United States\r\nthe colors of France. I thereupon proposed to receive them last Friday,\r\nthe first day of the new year, a day of general joy and congratulation.\r\nOn that day the minister of the French Republic delivered the colors,\r\nwith an address, to which I returned an answer. By the latter Congress\r\nwill see that I have informed the minister that the colors will be\r\ndeposited with the archives of the United States. But it seemed to\r\nme proper previously to exhibit to the two Houses of Congress these\r\nevidences of the continued friendship of the French Republic, together\r\nwith the sentiments expressed by me on the occasion in behalf of the\r\nUnited States. They are herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 8, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to you a memorial of the commissioners appointed by virtue\r\nof an act entitled \"An act for establishing the temporary and permanent\r\nseat of the Government of the United States,\" on the subject of the\r\npublic buildings under their direction.\r\n\r\nSince locating a district for the permanent seat of the Government of\r\nthe United States, as heretofore announced to both Houses of Congress,\r\nI have accepted the grants of money and of land stated in the memorial\r\nof the commissioners. I have directed the buildings therein mentioned\r\nto be commenced on plans which I deemed consistent with the liberality\r\nof the grants and proper for the purposes intended.\r\n\r\nI have not been inattentive to this important business intrusted by the\r\nLegislature to my care. I have viewed the resources placed in my hands,\r\nand observed the manner in which they have been applied. The progress is\r\npretty fully detailed in the memorial from the commissioners, and one\r\nof them attends to give further information if required. In a case new\r\nand arduous, like the present, difficulties might naturally be expected.\r\nSome have occurred, but they are in a great degree surmounted, and I\r\nhave no doubt, if the remaining resources are properly cherished, so\r\nas to prevent the loss of property by hasty and numerous sales, that all\r\nthe buildings required for the accommodation of the Government of the\r\nUnited States may be completed in season without aid from the Federal\r\nTreasury. The subject is therefore recommended to the consideration of\r\nCongress, and the result will determine the measures which I shall cause\r\nto be pursued with respect to the property remaining unsold.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 29, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI send herewith for the information of Congress:\r\n\r\nFirst. An act of the legislature of the State of Rhode Island, ratifying\r\nan amendment to the Constitution of the United States to prevent suits\r\nin certain cases against a State.\r\n\r\nSecond. An act of the State of North Carolina making the like\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nThird. An act of the State of North Carolina, assenting to the purchase\r\nby the United States of a sufficient quantity of land on Shell Castle\r\nIsland for the purpose of erecting a beacon thereon, and ceding the\r\njurisdiction thereof to the United States.\r\n\r\nFourth. A copy from the journal of proceedings of the governor in his\r\nexecutive department of the territory of the United States northwest\r\nof the river Ohio from July 1 to December 31, 1794.\r\n\r\nFifth. A copy from the records of the executive proceedings of the same\r\ngovernor from January 1 to June 30, 1795; and\r\n\r\nSixth and seventh. A copy of the journal of the proceedings of the\r\ngovernor in his executive department of the territory of the United\r\nStates south of the river Ohio from September 1, 1794, to September\r\n1, 1795.\r\n\r\nEighth. The acts of the first and second sessions of the general\r\nassembly of the same territory.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 29, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the authority vested in the President of the United\r\nStates by an act of Congress passed the 3d of March last, to reduce the\r\nweights of the copper coin of the United States whenever he should think\r\nit for the benefit of the United States, provided that the reduction\r\nshould not exceed 2 pennyweights in each cent, and in the like\r\nproportion in a half cent, I have caused the same to be reduced since\r\nthe 27th of last December, to wit, 1 pennyweight and 16 grains in each\r\ncent, and in the like proportion in a half cent; and I have given notice\r\nthereof by proclamation.\r\n\r\nBy the letter of the judges of the circuit court of the United States,\r\nheld at Boston in June last, and the inclosed application of the\r\nunderkeeper of the jail at that place, of which copies are herewith\r\ntransmitted, Congress will perceive the necessity of making a suitable\r\nprovision for the maintenance of prisoners committed to the jails of\r\nthe several States under the authority of the United States.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 2, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the copy of a letter, dated the 19th of December\r\nlast, from Governor Blount to the Secretary of War, stating the avowed\r\nand daring designs of certain persons to take possession of the lands\r\nbelonging to the Cherokees, and which the United States have by treaty\r\nsolemnly guaranteed to that nation. The injustice of such intrusions and\r\nthe mischievous consequences which must necessarily result therefrom\r\ndemand that effectual provision be made to prevent them.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 15, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nHerewith I transmit, for your consideration and advice, a treaty of\r\npeace and amity, concluded on the 5th day of last September by Joseph\r\nDonaldson, Jr., on the part of the United States, with the Dey of\r\nAlgiers, for himself, his Divan, and his subjects.\r\n\r\nThe instructions and other necessary papers relative to this negotiation\r\nare also sent herewith, for the information of the Senate.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 26, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI send herewith the treaty concluded on the 27th of October last between\r\nthe United States and Spain by their respective plenipotentiaries.\r\n\r\nThe communications to the Senate referred to in my message of the 16th\r\nof December, 1793, contain the instructions to the commissioners of\r\nthe United States, Messrs. Carmichael and Short, and various details\r\nrelative to the negotiations with Spain. Herewith I transmit copies of\r\nthe documents authorizing Mr. Pinckney, the envoy extraordinary from\r\nthe United States to the Court of Spain, to conclude the negotiation\r\nagreeably to the original instructions above mentioned, and to adjust\r\nthe claims of the United States for the spoliations committed by the\r\narmed vessels of His Catholic Majesty on the commerce of our citizens.\r\n\r\nThe numerous papers exhibiting the progress of the negotiation under the\r\nconduct of Mr. Pinckney, being in the French and Spanish languages, will\r\nbe communicated to the Senate as soon as the translations which appear\r\nnecessary shall be completed.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 1, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation concluded between the\r\nUnited States of America and His Britannic Majesty having been duly\r\nratified, and the ratifications having been exchanged at London on the\r\n28th day of October, 1795, I have directed the same to be promulgated,\r\nand herewith transmit a copy thereof for the information of Congress.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 8, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI send herewith, for the information of Congress, the treaty concluded\r\nbetween the United States and the Dey and Regency of Algiers.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 15, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nBy the ninth section of the act entitled \"An act to provide a naval\r\narmament\" it is enacted \"that if a peace shall take place between the\r\nUnited States and the Regency of Algiers, that no further proceedings\r\nbe had under this act.\"\r\n\r\nThe peace which is here contemplated having taken place, it is incumbent\r\nupon the Executive to suspend all orders respecting the building of the\r\nfrigates, procuring materials for them, or preparing materials already\r\nobtained, which may be done without intrenching upon contracts or\r\nagreements made and entered into before this event.\r\n\r\nBut inasmuch as the loss which the public would incur might be\r\nconsiderable from dissipation of workmen, from certain works or\r\noperations being suddenly dropped or left unfinished, and from the\r\nderangement in the whole system consequent upon an immediate suspension\r\nof all proceedings under it, I have therefore thought advisable, before\r\ntaking such a step, to submit the subject to the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, that such measures may be adopted in the premises\r\nas may best comport with the public interest.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 25, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI send herewith, for your information, the translation of a letter from\r\nthe minister plenipotentiary of the French Republic to the Secretary of\r\nState, announcing the peace made by the Republic with the Kings of\r\nPrussia and Spain, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and the Landgrave of Hesse\r\nCassel, and that the republican constitution decreed by the National\r\nConvention had been accepted by the people of France and was in\r\noperation. I also send you a copy of the answer given by my direction to\r\nthis communication from the French minister. My sentiments therein\r\nexpressed I am persuaded will harmonize with yours and with those of all\r\nmy fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 29, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI send herewith a copy of the treaty of friendship, limits, and\r\nnavigation, concluded on the 27th of October last, between the United\r\nStates and His Catholic Majesty. This treaty has been ratified by me\r\nagreeably to the Constitution, and the ratification has been dispatched\r\nfor Spain, where it will doubtless be immediately ratified by His\r\nCatholic Majesty.\r\n\r\nThis early communication of the treaty with Spain has become necessary\r\nbecause it is stipulated in the third article that commissioners for\r\nrunning the boundary line between the territory of the United States and\r\nthe Spanish colonies of East and West Florida shall meet at the Natchez\r\nbefore the expiration of six months from the ratification; and as that\r\nperiod will undoubtedly arrive before the next meeting of Congress,\r\nthe House will see the necessity of making provision in their present\r\nsession for the object here mentioned. It will also be necessary to\r\nprovide for the expense to be incurred in executing the twenty-first\r\narticle of the treaty, to enable our fellow-citizens to obtain with as\r\nlittle delay as possible compensation for the losses they have sustained\r\nby the capture of their vessels and cargoes by the subjects of His\r\nCatholic Majesty during the late war between France and Spain.\r\n\r\nEstimates of the moneys necessary to be provided for the purposes of\r\nthis and several other treaties with foreign nations and the Indian\r\ntribes will be laid before you by the proper Department.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 30, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nWith the utmost attention I have considered your resolution of the\r\n24th instant, requesting me to lay before your House a copy of the\r\ninstructions to the minister of the United States who negotiated the\r\ntreaty with the King of Great Britain, together with the correspondence\r\nand other documents relative to that treaty, excepting such of the said\r\npapers as any existing negotiation may render improper to be disclosed.\r\n\r\nIn deliberating upon this subject it was impossible for me to lose sight\r\nof the principle which some have avowed in its discussion, or to avoid\r\nextending my views to the consequences which must flow from the\r\nadmission of that principle.\r\n\r\nI trust that no part of my conduct has ever indicated a disposition to\r\nwithhold any information which the Constitution has enjoined upon the\r\nPresident as a duty to give, or which could be required of him by either\r\nHouse of Congress as a right; and with truth I affirm that it has been,\r\nas it will continue to be while I have the honor to preside in the\r\nGovernment, my constant endeavor to harmonize with the other branches\r\nthereof so far as the trust delegated to me by the people of the United\r\nStates and my sense of the obligation it imposes to \"preserve, protect,\r\nand defend the Constitution\" will permit.\r\n\r\nThe nature of foreign negotiations requires caution, and their success\r\nmust often depend on secrecy; and even when brought to a conclusion a\r\nfull disclosure of all the measures, demands, or eventual concessions\r\nwhich may have been proposed or contemplated would be extremely\r\nimpolitic; for this might have a pernicious influence on future\r\nnegotiations, or produce immediate inconveniences, perhaps danger and\r\nmischief, in relation to other powers. The necessity of such caution and\r\nsecrecy was one cogent reason for vesting the power of making treaties\r\nin the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, the\r\nprinciple on which that body was formed confining it to a small number\r\nof members. To admit, then, a right in the House of Representatives\r\nto demand and to have as a matter of course all the papers respecting\r\na negotiation with a foreign power would be to establish a dangerous\r\nprecedent.\r\n\r\nIt does not occur that the inspection of the papers asked for can\r\nbe relative to any purpose under the cognizance of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, except that of an impeachment, which the resolution\r\nhas not expressed. I repeat that I have no disposition to withhold any\r\ninformation which the duty of my station will permit or the public good\r\nshall require to be disclosed; and, in fact, all the papers affecting\r\nthe negotiation with Great Britain were, laid before the Senate when\r\nthe treaty itself was communicated for their consideration and advice.\r\n\r\nThe course which the debate has taken on the resolution of the House\r\nleads to some observations on the mode of making treaties under the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nHaving been a member of the General Convention, and knowing the\r\nprinciples on which the Constitution was formed, I have ever entertained\r\nbut one opinion on this subject; and from the first establishment of the\r\nGovernment to this moment my conduct has exemplified that opinion--that\r\nthe power of making treaties is exclusively vested in the President,\r\nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate, provided two-thirds\r\nof the Senators present concur; and that every treaty so made and\r\npromulgated thenceforward became the law of the land. It is thus that\r\nthe treaty-making power has been understood by foreign nations, and\r\nin all the treaties made with them _we_ have declared and _they_ have\r\nbelieved that, when ratified by the President, with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, they became obligatory. In this construction\r\nof the Constitution every House of Representatives has heretofore\r\nacquiesced, and until the present time not a doubt or suspicion has\r\nappeared, to my knowledge, that this construction was not the true one.\r\nNay, they have more than acquiesced; for till now, without controverting\r\nthe obligation of such treaties, they have made all the requisite\r\nprovisions for carrying them into effect.\r\n\r\nThere is also reason to believe that this construction agrees with\r\nthe opinions entertained by the State conventions when they were\r\ndeliberating on the Constitution, especially by those who objected to it\r\nbecause there was not required in _commercial treaties_ the consent of\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole number of the members of the Senate instead of\r\ntwo-thirds of the Senators present, and because in treaties respecting\r\nterritorial and certain other rights and claims the concurrence of\r\nthree-fourths of the whole number of the members of both Houses,\r\nrespectively, was not made necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact declared by the General Convention and universally\r\nunderstood that the Constitution of the United States was the result\r\nof a spirit of amity and mutual concession; and it is well known\r\nthat under this influence the smaller States were admitted to an equal\r\nrepresentation in the Senate with the larger States, and that this\r\nbranch of the Government was invested with great powers, for on the\r\nequal participation of those powers the sovereignty and political\r\nsafety of the smaller States were deemed essentially to depend.\r\n\r\nIf other proofs than these and the plain letter of the Constitution\r\nitself be necessary to ascertain the point under consideration, they\r\nmay be found in the journals of the General Convention, which I have\r\ndeposited in the office of the Department of State. In those journals\r\nit will appear that a proposition was made \"that no treaty should be\r\nbinding on the United States which was not ratified by a law,\" and\r\nthat the proposition was explicitly rejected.\r\n\r\nAs, therefore, it is perfectly clear to my understanding that the assent\r\nof the House of Representatives is not necessary to the validity of a\r\ntreaty; as the treaty with Great Britain exhibits in itself all the\r\nobjects requiring legislative provision, and on these the papers called\r\nfor can throw no light, and as it is essential to the due administration\r\nof the Government that the boundaries fixed by the Constitution between\r\nthe different departments should be preserved, a just regard to the\r\nConstitution and to the duty of my office, under all the circumstances\r\nof this case, forbids a compliance with your request.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 31, 1776_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nThe treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation between the United States\r\nand Great Britain requiring that commissioners should be appointed\r\nto fix certain boundaries between the territories of the contracting\r\nparties, and to ascertain the losses and damages represented to have\r\nbeen sustained by their respective citizens and subjects, as set forth\r\nin the fifth, sixth, and seventh articles of the treaty, in order to\r\ncarry those articles into execution I nominate as commissioners on\r\nthe part of the United States:\r\n\r\nFor the purpose mentioned in the fifth article, Henry Knox, of\r\nMassachusetts;\r\n\r\nFor the purpose mentioned in the sixth article, Thomas Fitzsimons,\r\nof Pennsylvania, and James Innes, of Virginia; and\r\n\r\nFor the purposes mentioned in the seventh article, Christopher Gore,\r\nof Massachusetts, and William Pinckney, of Maryland.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 8, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nBy an act of Congress passed on the 26th of May, 1790, it was declared\r\nthat the inhabitants of the territory of the United States south of the\r\nriver Ohio should enjoy all the privileges, benefits, and advantages set\r\nforth in the ordinance of Congress for the government of the territory\r\nof the United States northwest of the river Ohio, and that the\r\ngovernment of the said territory south of the Ohio should be similar to\r\nthat which was then exercised in the territory northwest of the Ohio,\r\nexcept so far as was otherwise provided in the conditions expressed in\r\nan act of Congress passed the 2d of April, 1790, entitled \"An act to\r\naccept a cession of the claims of the State of North Carolina to a\r\ncertain district of western territory.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the privileges, benefits, and advantages thus secured to the\r\ninhabitants of the territory south of the river Ohio appear to be the\r\nright of forming a permanent constitution and State government, and of\r\nadmission as a State, by its Delegates, into the Congress of the United\r\nStates, on an equal footing with the original States in all respects\r\nwhatever, when it should have therein 60,000 free inhabitants; provided\r\nthe constitution and government so to be formed should be republican,\r\nand in conformity to the principles contained in the articles of the\r\nsaid ordinance.\r\n\r\nAs proofs of the several requisites to entitle the territory south of\r\nthe river Ohio to be admitted as a State into the Union, Governor Blount\r\nhas transmitted a return of the enumeration of its inhabitants and a\r\nprinted copy of the constitution and form of government on which they\r\nhave agreed, which, with his letters accompanying the same, are herewith\r\nlaid before Congress.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _April 28, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHerewith I lay before you a letter from the Attorney-General of the\r\nUnited States, relative to compensation to the attorneys of the United\r\nStates in the several districts, which is recommended to your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 2, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nSome time last year Jeremiah Wadsworth was authorized to hold a treaty\r\nwith the Cohnawaga Indians, styling themselves the Seven Nations of\r\nCanada, to enable the State of New York to extinguish, by purchase, a\r\nclaim which the said Indians had set up to a parcel of land lying within\r\nthat State. The negotiation having issued without effecting its object,\r\nand the State of New York having requested a renewal of the negotiation,\r\nand the Indians having come forward with an application on the same\r\nsubject, I now nominate Jeremiah Wadsworth to be a commissioner to\r\nhold a treaty with the Cohnawaga Indians, styling themselves the Seven\r\nNations of Canada, for the purpose of enabling the State of New York\r\nto extinguish the aforesaid claim.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 5, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you, for your consideration and advice, an explanatory\r\narticle proposed to be added to the treaty of amity, commerce, and\r\nnavigation between the United States and Great Britain, together with a\r\ncopy of the full power to the Secretary of State to negotiate the same.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 25, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe measures now in operation for taking possession of the posts of\r\nDetroit and Michilimackinac render it proper that provision should be\r\nmade for extending to these places and any others alike circumstanced\r\nthe civil authority of the Northwestern Territory. To do this will\r\nrequire an expense to defray which the ordinary salaries of the governor\r\nand secretary of that Territory appear to be incompetent.\r\n\r\nThe forming of a new county, or new counties, and the appointment of the\r\nvarious officers, which the just exercise of government must require,\r\nwill oblige the governor and secretary to visit those places, and to\r\nspend considerable time in making the arrangements necessary for\r\nintroducing and establishing the Government of the United States.\r\nCongress will consider what provision will in this case be proper.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _May 28, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary expenses to be incurred in the present year in\r\nsupporting our foreign intercourse I find will require a provision\r\nbeyond the ordinary appropriation and the additional $20,000 already\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nI have directed an estimate to be made, which is sent herewith, and\r\nwill exhibit the deficiency for which an appropriation appears to be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH ANNUAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _December 7, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn recurring to the internal situation of our country since I had\r\nlast the pleasure to address you, I find ample reason for a renewed\r\nexpression of that gratitude to the Ruler of the Universe which a\r\ncontinued series of prosperity has so often and so justly called forth.\r\n\r\nThe acts of the last session which required special arrangements have\r\nbeen as far as circumstances would admit carried into operation.\r\n\r\nMeasures calculated to insure a continuance of the friendship of the\r\nIndians and to preserve peace along the extent of our interior frontier\r\nhave been digested and adopted. In the framing of these care has been\r\ntaken to guard on the one hand our advanced settlements from the\r\npredatory incursions of those unruly individuals who can not be\r\nrestrained by their tribes, and on the other hand to protect the rights\r\nsecured to the Indians by treaty--to draw them nearer to the civilized\r\nstate and inspire them with correct conceptions of the power as well\r\nas justice of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the deputies from the Creek Nation at Colerain, in the\r\nState of Georgia, which had for a principal object the purchase of\r\na parcel of their land by that State, broke up without its being\r\naccomplished, the nation having previous to their departure instructed\r\nthem against making any sale. The occasion, however, has been improved\r\nto confirm by a new treaty with the Creeks their preexisting engagements\r\nwith the United States, and to obtain their consent to the establishment\r\nof trading houses and military posts within their boundary, by means of\r\nwhich their friendship and the general peace may be more effectually\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nThe period during the late session at which the appropriation was passed\r\nfor carrying into effect the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation\r\nbetween the United States and His Britannic Majesty necessarily\r\nprocrastinated the reception of the posts stipulated to be delivered\r\nbeyond the date assigned for that event. As soon, however, as the\r\nGovernor-General of Canada could be addressed with propriety on the\r\nsubject, arrangements were cordially and promptly concluded for their\r\nevacuation, and the United States took possession of the principal of\r\nthem, comprehending Oswego, Niagara, Detroit, Michilimackinac, and Fort\r\nMiami, where such repairs and additions have been ordered to be made as\r\nappeared indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and of\r\nGreat Britain to determine which is the river St. Croix mentioned in the\r\ntreaty of peace of 1783, agreed in the choice of Egbert Benson, esq., of\r\nNew York, for the third commissioner. The whole met at St. Andrews, in\r\nPassamaquoddy Bay, in the beginning of October, and directed surveys to\r\nbe made of the rivers in dispute; but deeming it impracticable to have\r\nthese surveys completed before the next year, they adjourned to meet\r\nat Boston in August, 1797, for the final decision of the question.\r\n\r\nOther commissioners appointed on the part of the United States,\r\nagreeably to the seventh article of the treaty with Great Britain,\r\nrelative to captures and condemnation of vessels and other property,\r\nmet the commissioners of His Britannic Majesty in London in August last,\r\nwhen John Trumbull, esq., was chosen by lot for the fifth commissioner.\r\nIn October following the board were to proceed to business. As yet there\r\nhas been no communication of commissioners on the part of Great Britain\r\nto unite with those who have been appointed on the part of the United\r\nStates for carrying into effect the sixth article of the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with Spain required that the commissioners for running\r\nthe boundary line between the territory of the United States and His\r\nCatholic Majesty's provinces of East and West Florida should meet at the\r\nNatchez before the expiration of six months after the exchange of the\r\nratifications, which was effected at Aranjuez on the 25th day of April;\r\nand the troops of His Catholic Majesty occupying any posts within the\r\nlimits of the United States were within the same period to be withdrawn.\r\nThe commissioner of the United States therefore commenced his journey\r\nfor the Natchez in September, and troops were ordered to occupy the\r\nposts from which the Spanish garrisons should be withdrawn. Information\r\nhas been recently received of the appointment of a commissioner on the\r\npart of His Catholic Majesty for running the boundary line, but none of\r\nany appointment for the adjustment of the claims of our citizens whose\r\nvessels were captured by the armed vessels of Spain.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act of Congress passed in the last session for the\r\nprotection and relief of American seamen, agents were appointed, one to\r\nreside in Great Britain and the other in the West Indies. The effects of\r\nthe agency in the West Indies are not yet fully ascertained, but those\r\nwhich have been communicated afford grounds to believe the measure will\r\nbe beneficial. The agent destined to reside in Great Britain declining\r\nto accept the appointment, the business has consequently devolved on the\r\nminister of the United States in London, and will command his attention\r\nuntil a new agent shall be appointed.\r\n\r\nAfter many delays and disappointments arising out of the European war,\r\nthe final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to the Dey\r\nand Regency of Algiers will in all present appearance be crowned with\r\nsuccess, but under great, though inevitable, disadvantages in the\r\npecuniary transactions occasioned by that war, which will render further\r\nprovision necessary. The actual liberation of all our citizens who were\r\nprisoners in Algiers, while it gratifies every feeling heart, is itself\r\nan earnest of a satisfactory termination of the whole negotiation.\r\nMeasures are in operation for effecting treaties with the Regencies\r\nof Tunis and Tripoli.\r\n\r\nTo an active external commerce the protection of a naval force is\r\nindispensable. This is manifest with regard to wars in which a State\r\nis itself a party. But besides this, it is in our own experience that\r\nthe most sincere neutrality is not a sufficient guard against the\r\ndepredations of nations at war. To secure respect to a neutral flag\r\nrequires a naval force organized and ready to vindicate it from insult\r\nor aggression. This may even prevent the necessity of going to war by\r\ndiscouraging belligerent powers from committing such violations of\r\nthe rights of the neutral party as may, first or last, leave no other\r\noption. From the best information I have been able to obtain it would\r\nseem as if our trade to the Mediterranean without a protecting force\r\nwill always be insecure and our citizens exposed to the calamities\r\nfrom which numbers of them have but just been relieved.\r\n\r\nThese considerations invite the United States to look to the means, and\r\nto set about the gradual creation of a navy. The increasing progress of\r\ntheir navigation promises them at no distant period the requisite supply\r\nof seamen, and their means in other respects favor the undertaking. It\r\nis an encouragement, likewise, that their particular situation will give\r\nweight and influence to a moderate naval force in their hands. Will it\r\nnot, then, be advisable to begin without delay to provide and lay up the\r\nmaterials for the building and equipping of ships of war, and to proceed\r\nin the work by degrees, in proportion as our resources shall render it\r\npracticable without inconvenience, so that a future war of Europe may\r\nnot find our commerce in the same unprotected state in which it was\r\nfound by the present?\r\n\r\nCongress have repeatedly, and not without success, directed their\r\nattention to the encouragement of manufactures. The object is of too\r\nmuch consequence not to insure a continuance of their efforts in every\r\nway which shall appear eligible. As a general rule, manufactures on\r\npublic account are inexpedient; but where the state of things in a\r\ncountry leaves little hope that certain branches of manufacture will for\r\na great length of time obtain, when these are of a nature essential to\r\nthe furnishing and equipping of the public force in time of war, are\r\nnot establishments for procuring them on public account to the extent\r\nof the ordinary demand for the public service recommended by strong\r\nconsiderations of national policy as an exception to the general\r\nrule? Ought our country to remain in such cases dependent on foreign\r\nsupply, precarious because liable to be interrupted? If the necessary\r\narticle should in this mode cost more in time of peace, will not the\r\nsecurity and independence thence arising form an ample compensation?\r\nEstablishments of this sort, commensurate only with the calls of the\r\npublic service in time of peace, will in time of war easily be extended\r\nin proportion to the exigencies of the Government, and may even perhaps\r\nbe made to yield a surplus for the supply of our citizens at large, so\r\nas to mitigate the privations from the interruption of their trade. If\r\nadopted, the plan ought to exclude all those branches which are already,\r\nor likely soon to be, established in the country, in order that there\r\nmay be no danger of interference with pursuits of individual industry.\r\n\r\nIt will not be doubted that with reference either to individual or\r\nnational welfare agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as\r\nnations advance in population and other circumstances of maturity this\r\ntruth becomes more apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil\r\nmore and more an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting\r\nit grow up, supported by the public purse; and to what object can it\r\nbe dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have been\r\nemployed to this end none have been attended with greater success than\r\nthe establishment of boards (composed of proper characters) charged\r\nwith collecting and diffusing information, and enabled by premiums and\r\nsmall pecuniary aids to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and\r\nimprovement. This species of establishment contributes doubly to the\r\nincrease of improvement by stimulating to enterprise and experiment,\r\nand by drawing to a common center the results everywhere of individual\r\nskill and observation, and spreading them thence over the whole nation.\r\nExperience accordingly has shewn that they are very cheap instruments\r\nof immense national benefits.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore proposed to the consideration of Congress the\r\nexpediency of establishing a national university and also a military\r\nacademy. The desirableness of both these institutions has so constantly\r\nincreased with every new view I have taken of the subject that I can not\r\nomit the opportunity of once for all recalling your attention to them.\r\n\r\nThe assembly to which I address myself is too enlightened not to be\r\nfully sensible how much a flourishing state of the arts and sciences\r\ncontributes to national prosperity and reputation.\r\n\r\nTrue it is that our country, much to its honor, contains many seminaries\r\nof learning highly respectable and useful; but the funds upon which they\r\nrest are too narrow to command the ablest professors in the different\r\ndepartments of liberal knowledge for the institution contemplated,\r\nthough they would be excellent auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nAmongst the motives to such an institution, the assimilation of the\r\nprinciples, opinions, and manners of our countrymen by the common\r\neducation of a portion of our youth from every quarter well deserves\r\nattention. The more homogeneous our citizens can be made in these\r\nparticulars the greater will be our prospect of permanent union; and a\r\nprimary object of such a national institution should be the education of\r\nour youth in the science of _government_. In a republic what species of\r\nknowledge can be equally important and what duty more pressing on its\r\nlegislature than to patronize a plan for communicating it to those who\r\nare to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?\r\n\r\nThe institution of a military academy is also recommended by cogent\r\nreasons. However pacific the general policy of a nation may be, it\r\nought never to be without an adequate stock of military knowledge for\r\nemergencies. The first would impair the energy of its character, and\r\nboth would hazard its safety or expose it to greater evils when war\r\ncould not be avoided; besides that, war might often not depend upon\r\nits own choice. In proportion as the observance of pacific maxims might\r\nexempt a nation from the necessity of practicing the rules of the\r\nmilitary art ought to be its care in preserving and transmitting, by\r\nproper establishments, the knowledge of that art. Whatever argument\r\nmay be drawn from particular examples superficially viewed, a thorough\r\nexamination of the subject will evince that the art of war is at once\r\ncomprehensive and complicated, that it demands much previous study, and\r\nthat the possession of it in its most improved and perfect state is\r\nalways of great moment to the security of a nation. This, therefore,\r\nought to be a serious care of every government, and for this purpose\r\nan academy where a regular course of instruction is given is an obvious\r\nexpedient which different nations have successfully employed.\r\n\r\nThe compensations to the officers of the United States in various\r\ninstances, and in none more than in respect to the most important\r\nstations, appear to call for legislative revision. The consequences of a\r\ndefective provision are of serious import to the Government. If private\r\nwealth is to supply the defect of public retribution, it will greatly\r\ncontract the sphere within which the selection of character for office\r\nis to be made, and will proportionally diminish the probability of\r\na choice of men able as well as upright. Besides that, it would be\r\nrepugnant to the vital principles of our Government virtually to exclude\r\nfrom public trusts talents and virtue unless accompanied by wealth.\r\n\r\nWhile in our external relations some serious inconveniences and\r\nembarrassments have been overcome and others lessened, it is with much\r\npain and deep regret I mention that circumstances of a very unwelcome\r\nnature have lately occurred. Our trade has suffered and is suffering\r\nextensive injuries in the West Indies from the cruisers and agents of\r\nthe French Republic, and communications have been received from its\r\nminister here which indicate the danger of a further disturbance of our\r\ncommerce by its authority, and which are in other respects far from\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nIt has been my constant, sincere, and earnest wish, in conformity with\r\nthat of our nation, to maintain cordial harmony and a perfectly friendly\r\nunderstanding with that Republic. This wish remains unabated, and I\r\nshall persevere in the endeavor to fulfill it to the utmost extent of\r\nwhat shall be consistent with a just and indispensable regard to the\r\nrights and honor of our country; nor will I easily cease to cherish the\r\nexpectation that a spirit of justice, candor, and friendship on the part\r\nof the Republic will eventually insure success.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing this course, however, I can not forget what is due to\r\nthe character of our Government and nation, or to a full and entire\r\nconfidence in the good sense, patriotism, self-respect, and fortitude\r\nof my countrymen.\r\n\r\nI reserve for a special message a more particular communication on this\r\ninteresting subject.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have directed an estimate of the appropriations necessary for the\r\nservice of the ensuing year to be submitted from the proper Department,\r\nwith a view of the public receipts and expenditures to the latest period\r\nto which an account can be prepared.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction I am able to inform you that the revenues of the\r\nUnited States continue in a state of progressive improvement.\r\n\r\nA reenforcement of the existing provisions for discharging our public\r\ndebt was mentioned in my address at the opening of the last session.\r\nSome preliminary steps were taken toward it, the maturing of which will\r\nno doubt engage your zealous attention during the present. I will only\r\nadd that it will afford me a heartfelt satisfaction to concur in such\r\nfurther measures as will ascertain to our country the prospect of a\r\nspeedy extinguishment of the debt. Posterity may have cause to regret\r\nif from any motive intervals of tranquillity are left unimproved for\r\naccelerating this valuable end.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nMy solicitude to see the militia of the United States placed on an\r\nefficient establishment has been so often and so ardently expressed\r\nthat I shall but barely recall the subject to your view on the present\r\noccasion, at the same time that I shall submit to your inquiry whether\r\nour harbors are yet sufficiently secured.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I now stand for the last time, in the midst\r\nof the representatives of the people of the United States, naturally\r\nrecalls the period when the administration of the present form of\r\ngovernment commenced, and I can not omit the occasion to congratulate\r\nyou and my country on the success of the experiment, nor to repeat my\r\nfervent supplications to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe and Sovereign\r\nArbiter of Nations that His providential care may still be extended to\r\nthe United States, that the virtue and happiness of the people may be\r\npreserved, and that the Government which they have instituted for the\r\nprotection of their liberties may be perpetual,\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE SENATE TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nWe thank you, sir, for your faithful and detailed exposure of the\r\nexisting situation of our country, and we sincerely join in sentiments\r\nof gratitude to an overruling Providence for the distinguished share of\r\npublic prosperity and private happiness which the people of the United\r\nStates so peculiarly enjoy.\r\n\r\nWe are fully sensible of the advantages that have resulted from the\r\nadoption of measures (which you have successfully carried into effect)\r\nto preserve peace, cultivate friendship, and promote civilization\r\namongst the Indian tribes on the Western frontiers. Feelings of humanity\r\nand the most solid political interests equally encourage the continuance\r\nof this system.\r\n\r\nWe observe with pleasure that the delivery of the military posts lately\r\noccupied by the British forces within the territory of the United States\r\nwas made with cordiality and promptitude as soon as circumstances would\r\nadmit, and that the other provisions of our treaties with Great Britain\r\nand Spain that were objects of eventual arrangement are about being\r\ncarried into effect with entire harmony and good faith.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate but unavoidable difficulties that opposed a timely\r\ncompliance with the terms of the Algerine treaty are much to be\r\nlamented, as they may occasion a temporary suspension of the advantages\r\nto be derived from a solid peace with that power and a perfect security\r\nfrom its predatory warfare. At the same time, the lively impressions\r\nthat affected the public mind on the redemption of our captive\r\nfellow-citizens afford the most laudable incentive to our exertions\r\nto remove the remaining obstacles.\r\n\r\nWe perfectly coincide with you in opinion that the importance of our\r\ncommerce demands a naval force for its protection against foreign insult\r\nand depredation, and our solicitude to attain that object will be always\r\nproportionate to its magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of accelerating the establishment of certain useful\r\nmanufactures by the intervention of legislative aid and protection and\r\nthe encouragement due to agriculture by the creation of boards (composed\r\nof intelligent individuals) to patronize this primary pursuit of society\r\nare subjects which will readily engage our most serious attention.\r\n\r\nA national university may be converted to the most useful purposes. The\r\nscience of legislation being so essentially dependent on the endowments\r\nof the mind, the public interests must receive effectual aid from the\r\ngeneral diffusion of knowledge, and the United States will assume a\r\nmore dignified station among the nations of the earth by the successful\r\ncultivation of the higher branches of literature.\r\n\r\nA military academy may be likewise rendered equally important. To aid\r\nand direct the physical force of the nation by cherishing a military\r\nspirit, enforcing a proper sense of discipline, and inculcating a\r\nscientific system of tactics is consonant to the soundest maxims of\r\npublic policy. Connected with and supported by such an establishment\r\na well-regulated militia, constituting the natural defense of the\r\ncountry, would prove the most effectual as well as economical\r\npreservative of peace.\r\n\r\nWe can not but consider with serious apprehensions the inadequate\r\ncompensations of the public officers, especially of those in the more\r\nimportant stations. It is not only a violation of the spirit of a\r\npublic contract, but is an evil so extensive in its operation and so\r\ndestructive in its consequences that we trust it will receive the most\r\npointed legislative attention.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely lament that, whilst the conduct of the United States has\r\nbeen uniformly impressed with the character of equity, moderation, and\r\nlove of peace in the maintenance of all their foreign relationships, our\r\ntrade should be so harassed by the cruisers and agents of the Republic\r\nof France throughout the extensive departments of the West Indies.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are confident that no cause of complaint exists that could\r\nauthorize an interruption of our tranquillity or disengage that Republic\r\nfrom the bonds of amity, cemented by the faith of treaties, we can not\r\nbut express our deepest regrets that official communications have been\r\nmade to you indicating a more serious disturbance of our commerce.\r\nAlthough we cherish the expectation that a sense of justice and a\r\nconsideration of our mutual interests will moderate their councils, we\r\nare not unmindful of the situation in which events may place us, nor\r\nunprepared to adopt that system of conduct which, compatible with the\r\ndignity of a respectable nation, necessity may compel us to pursue.\r\n\r\nWe cordially acquiesce in the reflection that the United States, under\r\nthe operation of the Federal Government, have experienced a most rapid\r\naggrandizement and prosperity as well political as commercial.\r\n\r\nWhilst contemplating the causes that produce this auspicious result, we\r\nmust acknowledge the excellence of the constitutional system and the\r\nwisdom of the legislative provisions; but we should be deficient in\r\ngratitude and justice did we not attribute a great portion of these\r\nadvantages to the virtue, firmness, and talents of your Administration,\r\nwhich have been conspicuously displayed in the most trying time and on\r\nthe most critical occasions. It is therefore with the sincerest regret\r\nthat we now receive an official notification of your intentions to\r\nretire from the public employments of your country.\r\n\r\nWhen we review the various scenes of your public life, so long and so\r\nsuccessfully devoted to the most arduous services, civil and military,\r\nas well during the struggles of the American Revolution as the\r\nconvulsive periods of a recent date, we can not look forward to your\r\nretirement without our warmest affections and most anxious regards\r\naccompanying you, and without mingling with our fellow-citizens at large\r\nin the sincerest wishes for your personal happiness that sensibility and\r\nattachment can express.\r\n\r\nThe most effectual consolation that can offer for the loss we are about\r\nto sustain arises from the animating reflection that the influence of\r\nyour example will extend to your successors, and the United States thus\r\ncontinue to enjoy an able, upright, and energetic administration.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS,\r\n\r\n_Vice-President of the United States and President of the Senate_.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 10, 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: It affords me great satisfaction to find in your address a\r\nconcurrence in sentiment with me on the various topics which I presented\r\nfor your information and deliberation, and that the latter will receive\r\nfrom you an attention proportioned to their respective importance.\r\n\r\nFor the notice you take of my public services, civil and military, and\r\nyour kind wishes for my personal happiness, I beg you to accept my\r\ncordial thanks. Those services, and greater had I possessed ability to\r\nrender them, were due to the unanimous calls of my country, and its\r\napprobation is my abundant reward.\r\n\r\nWhen contemplating the period of my retirement, I saw virtuous and\r\nenlightened men among whom I relied on the discernment and patriotism\r\nof my fellow-citizens to make the proper choice of, a successor--men\r\nwho would require no influential example to insure to the United States\r\n\"an able, upright, and energetic administration.\" To such men I shall\r\ncheerfully yield the palm of genius and talents to serve our common\r\ncountry; but at the same time I hope I may be indulged in expressing the\r\nconsoling reflection (which consciousness suggests), and to bear it with\r\nme to my grave, that none can serve it with purer intentions than I have\r\ndone or with a more disinterested zeal.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 12, 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, PRESIDENT\r\nOF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: The House of Representatives have attended to your communication\r\nrespecting the state of our country with all the sensibility that the\r\ncontemplation of the subject and a sense of duty can inspire.\r\n\r\nWe are gratified by the information that measures calculated to insure\r\na continuance of the friendship of the Indians and to maintain the\r\ntranquillity of the Western frontier have been adopted, and we indulge\r\nthe hope that these, by impressing the Indian tribes with more correct\r\nconceptions of the justice as well as power of the United States, will\r\nbe attended with success.\r\n\r\nWhile we notice with satisfaction the steps that you have taken in\r\npursuance of the late treaties with several foreign nations, the\r\nliberation of our citizens who were prisoners at Algiers is a subject\r\nof peculiar felicitation. We shall cheerfully cooperate in any further\r\nmeasures that shall appear on consideration to be requisite.\r\n\r\nWe have ever concurred with you in the most sincere and uniform\r\ndisposition to preserve our neutral relations inviolate, and it is of\r\ncourse with anxiety and deep regret we hear that any interruption of\r\nour harmony with the French Republic has occurred, for we feel with you\r\nand with our constituents the cordial and unabated wish to maintain a\r\nperfectly friendly understanding with that nation. Your endeavors to\r\nfulfill that wish, and by all honorable means to preserve peace, and\r\nto restore that harmony and affection which have heretofore so happily\r\nsubsisted between the French Republic and the United States, can not\r\nfail, therefore, to interest our attention. And while we participate in\r\nthe full reliance you have expressed on the patriotism, self-respect,\r\nand fortitude of our countrymen, we cherish the pleasing hope that a\r\nmutual spirit of justice and moderation will insure the success of your\r\nperseverance.\r\n\r\nThe various subjects of your communication will respectively meet with\r\nthe attention that is due to their importance.\r\n\r\nWhen we advert to the internal situation of the United States, we deem\r\nit equally natural and becoming to compare the present period with\r\nthat immediately antecedent to the operation of the Government, and to\r\ncontrast it with the calamities in which the state of war still involves\r\nseveral of the European nations, as the reflections deduced from both\r\ntend to justify as well as to excite a warmer admiration of our free\r\nConstitution, and to exalt our minds to a more fervent and grateful\r\nsense of piety toward Almighty God for the beneficence of His\r\nprovidence, by which its administration has been hitherto so remarkably\r\ndistinguished. And while we entertain a grateful conviction that your\r\nwise, firm, and patriotic Administration has been signally conducive to\r\nthe success of the present form of government, we can not forbear to\r\nexpress the deep sensations of regret with which we contemplate your\r\nintended retirement from office.\r\n\r\nAs no other suitable occasion may occur, we can not suffer the present\r\nto pass without attempting to disclose some of the emotions which it can\r\nnot fail to awaken.\r\n\r\nThe gratitude and admiration of your countrymen are still drawn to the\r\nrecollection of those resplendent virtues and talents which were so\r\neminently instrumental to the achievement of the Revolution, and of\r\nwhich that glorious event will ever be the memorial. Your obedience to\r\nthe voice of duty and your country when you quitted reluctantly a second\r\ntime the retreat you had chosen and first accepted the Presidency\r\nafforded a new proof of the devotedness of your zeal in its service and\r\nan earnest of the patriotism and success which have characterized your\r\nAdministration. As the grateful confidence of the citizens in the\r\nvirtues of their Chief Magistrate has essentially contributed to that\r\nsuccess, we persuade ourselves that the millions whom we represent\r\nparticipate with us in the anxious solicitude of the present occasion.\r\n\r\nYet we can not be unmindful that your moderation and magnanimity, twice\r\ndisplayed by retiring from your exalted stations, afford examples no\r\nless rare and instructive to mankind than valuable to a republic.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are sensible that this event of itself completes the luster\r\nof a character already conspicuously unrivaled by the coincidence of\r\nvirtue, talents, success, and public estimation, yet we conceive we owe\r\nit to you, sir, and still more emphatically to ourselves and to our\r\nnation (of the language of whose hearts we presume to think ourselves\r\nat this moment the faithful interpreters), to express the sentiments\r\nwith which it is contemplated.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of a free and enlightened nation offering, by its\r\nRepresentatives, the tribute of unfeigned approbation to its first\r\ncitizen, however novel and interesting it may be, derives all its luster\r\n(a luster which accident or enthusiasm could not bestow, and which\r\nadulation would tarnish) from the transcendent merit of which it is\r\nthe voluntary testimony.\r\n\r\nMay you long enjoy that liberty which is so dear to you, and to which\r\nyour name will ever be so dear. May your own virtues and a nation's\r\nprayers obtain the happiest sunshine for the decline of your days and\r\nthe choicest of future blessings. For our country's sake, for the sake\r\nof republican liberty, it is our earnest wish that your example may be\r\nthe guide of your successors, and thus, after being the ornament and\r\nsafeguard of the present age, become the patrimony of our descendants.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 15, 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: To a citizen whose views were unambitious, who preferred the\r\nshade and tranquillity of private life to the splendor and solicitude\r\nof elevated stations, and whom the voice of duty and his country could\r\nalone have drawn from his chosen retreat, no reward for his public\r\nservices can be so grateful as public approbation, accompanied by a\r\nconsciousness that to render those services useful to that country has\r\nbeen his single aim; and when this approbation is expressed by the\r\nRepresentatives of a free and enlightened nation, the reward will admit\r\nof no addition. Receive, gentlemen, my sincere and affectionate thanks\r\nfor this signal testimony that my services have been acceptable and\r\nuseful to my country. The strong confidence of my fellow-citizens, while\r\nit animated all my actions, insured their zealous cooperation, which\r\nrendered those services successful. The virtue and wisdom of my\r\nsuccessors, joined with the patriotism and intelligence of the citizens\r\nwho compose the other branches of Government, I firmly trust will\r\nlead them to the adoption of measures which, by the beneficence of\r\nProvidence, will give stability to our system of government, add to its\r\nsuccess, and secure to ourselves and to posterity that liberty which is\r\nto all of us so dear.\r\n\r\nWhile I acknowledge with pleasure the sincere and uniform disposition\r\nof the House of Representatives to preserve our neutral relations\r\ninviolate, and with them deeply regret any degree of interruption of\r\nour good understanding with the French Republic, I beg you, gentlemen,\r\nto rest assured that my endeavors will be earnest and unceasing by all\r\nhonorable means to preserve peace and to restore that harmony and\r\naffection which have heretofore so happily subsisted between our two\r\nnations; and with you I cherish the pleasing hope that a mutual spirit\r\nof justice and moderation will crown those endeavors with success.\r\n\r\nI shall cheerfully concur in the beneficial measures which your\r\ndeliberations shall mature on the various subjects demanding your\r\nattention; and while directing your labors to advance the real interests\r\nof our country, you receive its blessings. With perfect sincerity my\r\nindividual wishes will be offered for your present and future felicity.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 16, 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 4, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI lay before you for your consideration a treaty which has been\r\nnegotiated and concluded on the 29th day of June last by Benjamin\r\nHawkins, Andrew Pickens, and George Clymer, commissioners on behalf\r\nof the United States, with the Creek Indians, together with the\r\ninstructions which were given to the said commissioners and the\r\nproceedings at the place of treaty.\r\n\r\nI submit also the proceedings and result of a treaty, held at the city\r\nof New York, on behalf of the State of New York, with certain nations or\r\ntribes of Indians denominating themselves the Seven Nations of Canada.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 9, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHerewith I lay before you in confidence reports from the Departments of\r\nState and the Treasury, by which you will see the present situation of\r\nour affairs with the Dey and Regency of Algiers.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _January 19, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the present session of Congress I mentioned that some\r\ncircumstances of an unwelcome nature had lately occurred in relation\r\nto France; that our trade had suffered, and was suffering, extensive\r\ninjuries in the West Indies from the cruisers and agents of the French\r\nRepublic, and that communications had been received from its minister\r\nhere which indicated danger of a further disturbance of our commerce by\r\nits authority, and that were in other respects far from agreeable, but\r\nthat I reserved for a special message a more particular communication\r\non this interesting subject. This communication I now make.\r\n\r\nThe complaints of the French minister embraced most of the transactions\r\nof our Government in relation to France from an early period of the\r\npresent war, which, therefore, it was necessary carefully to review.\r\nA collection has been formed of letters and papers relating to those\r\ntransactions, which I now lay before you, with a letter to Mr. Pinckney,\r\nour minister at Paris, containing an examination of the notes of the\r\nFrench minister and such information as I thought might be useful to\r\nMr. Pinckney in any further representations he might find necessary to\r\nbe made to the French Government. The immediate object of his mission\r\nwas to make to that Government such explanations of the principles and\r\nconduct of our own as, by manifesting our good faith, might remove all\r\njealousy and discontent and maintain that harmony and good understanding\r\nwith the French Republic which it has been my constant solicitude to\r\npreserve. A government which required only a knowledge of the _truth_\r\nto justify its measures could not but be anxious to have this fully\r\nand frankly displayed.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _March 2, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate_:\r\n\r\nApplication having been made to me to permit a treaty to be held with\r\nthe Seneca Nation of Indians to effect the purchase of a parcel of their\r\nland under a preemption right derived from the State of Massachusetts\r\nand situated within the State of New York, and it appearing to me\r\nreasonable that such opportunity should be afforded, provided the\r\nnegotiation shall be conducted at the expense of the applicant, and at\r\nthe desire and with the consent of the Indians, always considering these\r\nas prerequisites, I now nominate Isaac Smith to be a commissioner to\r\nhold a treaty with the Seneca Nation for the aforesaid purpose.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _February 28, 1797_.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHaving maturely considered the bill to alter and amend an act entitled\r\n\"An act to ascertain and fix the military establishment of the United\r\nStates,\" which was presented to me on the 22d day of this month, I now\r\nreturn it to the House of Representatives, in which it originated, with\r\nmy objections:\r\n\r\nFirst. If the bill passes into a law, the two companies of light\r\ndragoons will be from that moment _legally_ out of service, though they\r\nwill afterwards continue _actually_ in service; and for their services\r\nduring this interval, namely, from the time of _legal_ to the time of\r\n_actual_ discharge, it will not be lawful to pay them, unless some\r\nfuture provision be made by law. Though they may be discharged at the\r\npleasure of Congress, in justice they ought to receive their pay, not\r\nonly to the time of passing the law, but at least to the time of their\r\nactual discharge.\r\n\r\nSecondly. It will be inconvenient and injurious to the public to dismiss\r\nthe light dragoons as soon as notice of the law can be conveyed to them,\r\none of the companies having been lately destined to a necessary and\r\nimportant service.\r\n\r\nThirdly. The companies of light dragoons consist of 126 noncommissioned\r\nofficers and privates, who are bound to serve as dismounted dragoons\r\nwhen ordered so to do. They have received in bounties about $2,000. One\r\nof them is completely equipped, and above half of the noncommissioned\r\nofficers and privates have yet to serve more than one-third of the time\r\nof their enlistment; and besides, there will in the course of the year\r\nbe a considerable deficiency in the complement of infantry intended to\r\nbe continued. Under these circumstances, to discharge the dragoons does\r\nnot seem to comport with economy.\r\n\r\nFourthly. It is generally agreed that some cavalry, either militia or\r\nregular, will be necessary; and according to the best information I have\r\nbeen able to obtain, it is my opinion that the latter will be less\r\nexpensive and more useful than the former in preserving peace between\r\nthe frontier settlers and the Indians, and therefore a part of the\r\nmilitary establishment should consist of cavalry.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Senate Journal, vol. 2, p. 397.]\r\n\r\nMARCH 1, 1797.\r\n\r\n_To the Vice-President and Senators of the United States, respectively_.\r\n\r\nSIR: It appearing to me proper that the Senate of the United States\r\nshould be convened on Saturday, the 4th of March instant, you are\r\ndesired to attend in the Chamber of the Senate on that day, at 10\r\no'clock in the forenoon, to receive any communications which the\r\nPresident of the United States may then lay before you touching\r\ntheir interests.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAREWELL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES, _September 17, 1796_.\r\n\r\n_Friends and Fellow-Citizens:_\r\n\r\nThe period for a new election of a citizen to administer the Executive\r\nGovernment of the United States being not far distant, and the time\r\nactually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating the\r\nperson who is to be clothed with that important trust, it appears to me\r\nproper, especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of\r\nthe public voice, that I should now apprise you of the resolution I have\r\nformed to decline being considered among the number of those out of whom\r\na choice is to be made.\r\n\r\nI beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that\r\nthis resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all\r\nthe considerations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful\r\ncitizen to his country; and that in withdrawing the tender of service,\r\nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no\r\ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful\r\nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction\r\nthat the step is compatible with both.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of and continuance hitherto in the office to which\r\nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of\r\ninclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared\r\nto be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much\r\nearlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at\r\nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had been\r\nreluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this previous\r\nto the last election had even led to the preparation of an address to\r\ndeclare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and\r\ncritical posture of our affairs with foreign nations and the unanimous\r\nadvice of persons entitled to my confidence impelled me to abandon the\r\nidea. I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as\r\ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible\r\nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety, and am persuaded, whatever\r\npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present\r\ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination\r\nto retire.\r\n\r\nThe impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were\r\nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust I\r\nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed toward the\r\norganization and administration of the Government the best exertions\r\nof which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not unconscious in the\r\noutset of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in my own\r\neyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the\r\nmotives to diffidence of myself; and every day the increasing weight\r\nof years admonishes me more and more that the shade of retirement\r\nis as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any\r\ncircumstances have given peculiar value to my services they were\r\ntemporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while choice and\r\nprudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not\r\nforbid it.\r\n\r\nIn looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the\r\ncareer of my political life my feelings do not permit me to suspend the\r\ndeep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved\r\ncountry for the many honors it has conferred upon me; still more for\r\nthe steadfast confidence with which it has supported me, and for the\r\nopportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable\r\nattachment by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness\r\nunequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from\r\nthese services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as an\r\ninstructive example in our annals that under circumstances in which\r\nthe passions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mislead;\r\namidst appearances sometimes dubious; vicissitudes of fortune often\r\ndiscouraging; in situations in which not unfrequently want of success\r\nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support\r\nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guaranty of the plans by\r\nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall\r\ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows\r\nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence;\r\nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free\r\nConstitution which is the work of your hands may be sacredly maintained;\r\nthat its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom\r\nand virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of these States,\r\nunder the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so careful a\r\npreservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to\r\nthem the glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection, and\r\nadoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\r\n\r\nHere, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare which\r\ncan not end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger natural to\r\nthat solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to offer to\r\nyour solemn contemplation and to recommend to your frequent review some\r\nsentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no inconsiderable\r\nobservation, and which appear to me all important to the permanency of\r\nyour felicity as a people. These will be offered to you with the more\r\nfreedom as you can only see in them the disinterested warnings of a\r\nparting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his\r\ncounsel. Nor can I forget as an encouragement to it your indulgent\r\nreception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar occasion.\r\n\r\nInterwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your\r\nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm\r\nthe attachment.\r\n\r\nThe unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now\r\ndear to you. It is justly so, for it is a main pillar in the edifice of\r\nyour real independence, the support of your tranquillity at home, your\r\npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty\r\nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that from\r\ndifferent causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken,\r\nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this\r\ntruth, as this is the point in your political fortress against which the\r\nbatteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and\r\nactively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of\r\ninfinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of\r\nyour national union to your collective and individual happiness; that\r\nyou should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it;\r\naccustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of\r\nyour political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with\r\njealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion\r\nthat it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly frowning upon the\r\nfirst dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country\r\nfrom the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together\r\nthe various parts.\r\n\r\nFor this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens\r\nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to\r\nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to\r\nyou in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of\r\npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations.\r\nWith slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners,\r\nhabits, and political principles. You have in a common cause fought and\r\ntriumphed together. The independence and liberty you possess are the\r\nwork of joint councils and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings,\r\nand successes.\r\n\r\nBut these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves\r\nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more\r\nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds\r\nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the\r\nunion of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe _North_, in an unrestrained intercourse with the _South_, protected\r\nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions\r\nof the latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial\r\nenterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The\r\n_South_, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the\r\n_North_, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning\r\npartly into its own channels the seamen of the _North_, it finds its\r\nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes in different\r\nways to nourish and increase the general mass of the national\r\nnavigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime strength\r\nto which itself is unequally adapted. The _East_, in a like intercourse\r\nwith the _West_, already finds, and in the progressive improvement of\r\ninterior communications by land and water will more and more find,\r\na valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or\r\nmanufactures at home. The _West_ derives from the _East_ supplies\r\nrequisite to its growth and comfort, and what is perhaps of still\r\ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the _secure_ enjoyment\r\nof indispensable _outlets_ for its own productions to the weight,\r\ninfluence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of\r\nthe Union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest as _one\r\nnation_. Any other tenure by which the _West_ can hold this essential\r\nadvantage, whether derived from its own separate strength or from an\r\napostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, must be\r\nintrinsically precarious.\r\n\r\nWhile, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and\r\nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined can not fail to\r\nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater\r\nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less\r\nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations, and what is\r\nof inestimable value, they must derive from union an exemption from\r\nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict\r\nneighboring countries not tied together by the same governments, which\r\ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which\r\nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate\r\nand imbitter. Hence, likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those\r\novergrown military establishments which, under any form of government,\r\nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as\r\nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is that\r\nyour union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and\r\nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThese considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting\r\nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the union as a\r\nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common\r\ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it.\r\nTo listen to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are\r\nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the\r\nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will\r\nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and full\r\nexperiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union affecting\r\nall parts of our country, while experience shall not have demonstrated\r\nits impracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the\r\npatriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken\r\nits bands.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the causes which may disturb our union it occurs as\r\nmatter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for\r\ncharacterizing parties by _geographical_ discriminations--_Northern_ and\r\n_Southern, Atlantic_ and _Western_--whence designing men may endeavor\r\nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests\r\nand views, One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within\r\nparticular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other\r\ndistricts. You can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies\r\nand heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend\r\nto render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by\r\nfraternal affection. The inhabitants of our Western country have lately\r\nhad a useful lesson on this head. They have seen in the negotiation by\r\nthe Executive and in the unanimous ratification by the Senate of the\r\ntreaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at that event\r\nthroughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded were the\r\nsuspicions propagated among them of a policy in the General Government\r\nand in the Atlantic States unfriendly to their interests in regard to\r\nthe Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of two\r\ntreaties--that with Great Britain and that with Spain--which secure to\r\nthem everything they could desire in respect to our foreign relations\r\ntoward confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely\r\nfor the preservation of these advantages on the union by which they were\r\nprocured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such\r\nthere are, who would sever them from their brethren and connect them\r\nwith aliens?\r\n\r\nTo the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the whole\r\nis indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts can be\r\nan adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the infractions\r\nand interruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced.\r\nSensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your first\r\nessay by the adoption of a Constitution of Government better calculated\r\nthan your former for an intimate union and for the efficacious\r\nmanagement of your common concerns. This Government, the offspring of\r\nour own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation\r\nand mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the\r\ndistribution of its powers, uniting security with energy, and containing\r\nwithin itself a provision for its own amendment, has a just claim to\r\nyour confidence and your support. Respect for its authority, compliance\r\nwith its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties enjoined by the\r\nfundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of our political systems\r\nis the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of\r\ngovernment. But the constitution which at any time exists till changed\r\nby an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly\r\nobligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the\r\npeople to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual\r\nto obey the established government.\r\n\r\nAll obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations\r\nand associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real\r\ndesign to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation\r\nand action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this\r\nfundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize\r\nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the\r\nplace of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often\r\na small but artful and enterprising minority of the community, and,\r\naccording to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the\r\npublic administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous\r\nprojects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome\r\nplans, digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests.\r\n\r\nHowever combinations or associations of the above description may now\r\nand then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time\r\nand things to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and\r\nunprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and\r\nto usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards\r\nthe very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\r\n\r\nToward the preservation of your Government and the permanency of\r\nyour present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily\r\ndiscountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority,\r\nbut also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its\r\nprinciples, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be\r\nto effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will impair\r\nthe energy of the system, and thus to undermine what can not be directly\r\noverthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited remember that\r\ntime and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of\r\ngovernments as of other human institutions; that experience is the\r\nsurest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing\r\nconstitution of a country; that facility in changes upon the credit\r\nof mere hypothesis and opinion exposes to perpetual change, from the\r\nendless variety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember especially that\r\nfor the efficient management of your common interests in a country so\r\nextensive as ours a government of as much vigor as is consistent with\r\nthe perfect security of liberty is indispensable. Liberty itself will\r\nfind in such a government, with powers properly distributed and\r\nadjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little else than a\r\nname where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises\r\nof faction, to confine each member of the society within the limits\r\nprescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil\r\nenjoyment of the rights of person and property. I have already intimated\r\nto you the danger of parties in the State, with particular reference to\r\nthe founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a\r\nmore comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against\r\nthe baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.\r\n\r\nThis spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having\r\nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under\r\ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled,\r\nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its\r\ngreatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.\r\n\r\nThe alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the\r\nspirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages\r\nand countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself\r\na frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and\r\npermanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually\r\nincline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute\r\npower of an individual, and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing\r\nfaction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this\r\ndisposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of\r\npublic liberty.\r\n\r\nWithout looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless\r\nought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual\r\nmischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the\r\ninterest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\r\n\r\nIt serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public\r\nadministration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies\r\nand false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another;\r\nfoments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign\r\ninfluence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the\r\ngovernment itself through the channels of party passion. Thus the\r\npolicy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and\r\nwill of another.\r\n\r\nThere is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks\r\nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the\r\nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in\r\ngovernments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence,\r\nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular\r\ncharacter, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be\r\nencouraged. From their natural tendency it is certain there will always\r\nbe enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose; and there being\r\nconstant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of public\r\nopinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it\r\ndemands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame,\r\nlest, instead of warming, it should consume.\r\n\r\nIt is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free country\r\nshould inspire caution in those intrusted with its administration to\r\nconfine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres,\r\navoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach\r\nupon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers\r\nof all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of\r\ngovernment, a real despotism. A just estimate of that love of power\r\nand proneness to abuse it which predominates in the human heart is\r\nsufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity\r\nof reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by dividing\r\nand distributing it into different depositories, and constituting each\r\nthe guardian of the public weal against invasions by the others, has\r\nbeen evinced by experiments ancient and modern, some of them in our\r\ncountry and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary\r\nas to institute them. If in the opinion of the people the distribution\r\nor modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong,\r\nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution\r\ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this in\r\none instance may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon\r\nby which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always\r\ngreatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit\r\nwhich the use can at any time yield.\r\n\r\nOf all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity,\r\nreligion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man\r\nclaim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great\r\npillars of human happiness--these firmest props of the duties of men\r\nand citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought\r\nto respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their\r\nconnections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked,\r\nWhere is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if\r\nthe sense of religious obligation _desert_ the oaths which are the\r\ninstruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with\r\ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without\r\nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education\r\non minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us\r\nto expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nIt is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring\r\nof popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less force\r\nto every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend to it\r\ncan look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the\r\nfabric? Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions\r\nfor the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure\r\nof a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that\r\npublic opinion should be enlightened.\r\n\r\nAs a very important source of strength and security, cherish public\r\ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as\r\npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but\r\nremembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger\r\nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding\r\nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions\r\nof expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge\r\nthe debts which unavoidable wars have occasioned, not ungenerously\r\nthrowing upon posterity the burthen which we ourselves ought to bear.\r\nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives; but it\r\nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to\r\nthem the performance of their duty it is essential that you should\r\npractically bear in mind that toward the payment of debts there must\r\nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes\r\ncan be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant;\r\nthat the intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the\r\nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties), ought to\r\nbe a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of\r\nthe Government in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the\r\nmeasures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at\r\nany time dictate.\r\n\r\nObserve good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and\r\nharmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct. And can it\r\nbe that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a\r\nfree, enlightened, and at no distant period a great nation to give to\r\nmankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided\r\nby an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the course\r\nof time and things the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any\r\ntemporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it?\r\nCan it be that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of\r\na nation with its virtue? The experiment, at least, is recommended by\r\nevery sentiment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered\r\nimpossible by its vices?\r\n\r\nIn the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that\r\npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and\r\npassionate attachments for others should be excluded, and that in place\r\nof them just and amicable feelings toward all should be cultivated. The\r\nnation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual\r\nfondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to\r\nits affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its\r\nduty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes\r\neach more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of slight\r\ncauses of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable when accidental\r\nor trifling occasions of dispute occur.\r\n\r\nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests.\r\nThe nation prompted by ill will and resentment sometimes impels to\r\nwar the government contrary to the best calculations of policy. The\r\ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity, and adopts\r\nthrough passion what reason would reject. At other times it makes the\r\nanimosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility, instigated\r\nby pride, ambition, and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace\r\noften, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.\r\n\r\nSo, likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces\r\na variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the\r\nillusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common\r\ninterest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other,\r\nbetrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of\r\nthe latter without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also\r\nto concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others,\r\nwhich is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions by\r\nunnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained, and by\r\nexciting jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to retaliate in the\r\nparties from whom equal privileges are withheld; and it gives to\r\nambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the\r\nfavorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their\r\nown country without odium, sometimes even with popularity, gilding\r\nwith the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable\r\ndeference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good the\r\nbase or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.\r\n\r\nAs avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments\r\nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent\r\npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic\r\nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion,\r\nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small\r\nor weak toward a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be\r\nthe satellite of the latter. Against the insidious wiles of foreign\r\ninfluence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy\r\nof a free people ought to be _constantly_ awake, since history and\r\nexperience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes\r\nof republican government. But that jealousy, to be useful, must be\r\nimpartial, else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be\r\navoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one\r\nforeign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they\r\nactuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even\r\nsecond the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots who may resist\r\nthe intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious,\r\nwhile its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the\r\npeople to surrender their interests.\r\n\r\nThe great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is,\r\nin extending our commercial relations to have with them as little\r\n_political_ connection as possible. So far as we have already formed\r\nengagements let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let\r\nus stop.\r\n\r\nEurope has a set of primary interests which to us have none or a very\r\nremote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies,\r\nthe causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence,\r\ntherefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial\r\nties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary\r\ncombinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.\r\n\r\nOur detached, and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue\r\na different course. If we remain one people, under an efficient\r\ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury\r\nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will\r\ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously\r\nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making\r\nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation;\r\nwhen we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice,\r\nshall counsel.\r\n\r\nWhy forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own\r\nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that\r\nof any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of\r\nEuropean ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\r\n\r\nIt is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any\r\nportion of the foreign world, so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty\r\nto do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing\r\ninfidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable\r\nto public than to private affairs that honesty is always the best\r\npolicy. I repeat, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their\r\ngenuine sense. But in my opinion it is unnecessary and would be unwise\r\nto extend them.\r\n\r\nTaking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on\r\na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary\r\nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\r\n\r\nHarmony, liberal intercourse with all nations are recommended by policy,\r\nhumanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should hold an\r\nequal and impartial hand, neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors\r\nor preferences; consulting the natural course of things; diffusing\r\nand diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce, but forcing\r\nnothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in order to give trade a\r\nstable course, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the\r\nGovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best\r\nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary\r\nand liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as experience and\r\ncircumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view that it is folly\r\nin one nation to look for disinterested favors from another; that it\r\nmust pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept\r\nunder that character; that by such acceptance it may place itself in the\r\ncondition of having given equivalents for nominal favors, and yet of\r\nbeing reproached with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no\r\ngreater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation\r\nto nation. It is an illusion which experience must cure, which a just\r\npride ought to discard.\r\n\r\nIn offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and\r\naffectionate friend I dare not hope they will make the strong and\r\nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual\r\ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course\r\nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even\r\nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, some\r\noccasional good--that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury\r\nof party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to\r\nguard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this hope will be\r\na full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by which they\r\nhave been dictated.\r\n\r\nHow far in the discharge of my official duties I have been guided by\r\nthe principles which have been delineated the public records and other\r\nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To myself,\r\nthe assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least believed\r\nmyself to be guided by them.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the still subsisting war in Europe my proclamation\r\nof the 22d of April, 1793, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your\r\napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both Houses of\r\nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me,\r\nuninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\r\n\r\nAfter deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I\r\ncould obtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the\r\ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty\r\nand interest to take, a neutral position. Having taken it, I determined\r\nas far as should depend upon me to maintain it with moderation,\r\nperseverance, and firmness.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is\r\nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that,\r\naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from\r\nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually\r\nadmitted by all.\r\n\r\nThe duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without anything\r\nmore, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every\r\nnation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the\r\nrelations of peace and amity toward other nations.\r\n\r\nThe inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be\r\nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me a predominant\r\nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and\r\nmature its yet recent institutions, and to progress without interruption\r\nto that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give\r\nit, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.\r\n\r\nThough in reviewing the incidents of my Administration I am unconscious\r\nof intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not\r\nto think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever\r\nthey may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the\r\nevils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that\r\nmy country will never cease to view them with indulgence, and that,\r\nafter forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an\r\nupright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned\r\nto oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\r\n\r\nRelying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by that\r\nfervent love toward it which is so natural to a man who views in it the\r\nnative soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations,\r\nI anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise\r\nmyself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the\r\nmidst of my fellow-citizens the benign influence of good laws under a\r\nfree government--the ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy\r\nreward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON.",
