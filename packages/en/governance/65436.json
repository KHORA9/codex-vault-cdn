The gray granite\r\nbuilding which houses the Assembly, stands at the foot of Angora, with\r\nthe red and white Crescent and Star flying above it by night as well\r\nas by day. “The Pasha’s” car stood at the curb. He lives in a villa\r\npresented to him by the town of Angora, at Tchan-Kaya, a suburb three\r\nmiles away, and the sight of his car, a long gray machine of German\r\nmake, is one of the few means of tracing him. He is the easiest of all\r\nmen to meet, but the most difficult of all men to find.\r\n\r\nWithin the building, one of Kemal’s _aides_ led me to a large room off\r\nthe corridor, within which to await the end of the session. It was the\r\nroom in which I had first met him, a large room with a flat-top desk\r\nin the center of one side, with a row of chairs around the four walls,\r\nand a sheet-iron stove with a pile of cut wood beside it, in the\r\nmiddle of the carpet. I waited possibly a half-hour, listening to the\r\nnoise from the Assembly’s chamber and making guesses as to what the\r\ntrouble was. I had hoped to secure an hour or two with Kemal and had\r\nbeen listing, during the month I spent at Angora, a number of subjects\r\non which I was anxious to secure his opinions. But he is not only\r\ndifficult to find but difficult to hold for long. I had applied to the\r\nForeign Office a week before and I believe they were not only willing\r\nbut anxious to secure the appointment I wanted. My application,\r\nhowever, happened to coincide with a crisis in the Assembly and I had\r\nto make the best of a half-hour.\r\n\r\nThe session had no sooner broken up and the clamor of the deputies\r\nbegun to overflow from the chamber into the corridor, than the _aide_\r\nsummoned me. We crossed the corridor into a small room with a flat-top\r\ndesk and, in the corner behind the desk, the limp folds of a tall\r\ngreen banner inscribed with Turkish letters of gold. From his chair at\r\nthe desk, the military figure of Kemal himself in civilian clothes\r\nrose to greet me――a man with a face of iron beneath a great iron-gray\r\n_kalpak_. He spoke in French and the flash of much gold in his lower\r\nteeth gave sparkle to the military incisiveness of his manner, a\r\nmanner which conveyed an instant reminder of cavalry.\r\n\r\nHis face is one of severely simple lines. The lower line of the\r\n_kalpak_ comes down close to the straight eyebrows, and there is no\r\nwaste space between the eyebrows and the eyes themselves. “The Pasha”\r\nis reputed to have occasional fits of temper which reveal themselves\r\nin a noticeable squint in the pupils of his eyes, but during all the\r\ntime I talked with him that afternoon, those eyes of pale blue fixed\r\nthemselves on me and never left me.\r\n\r\nThere is a story of some famous German general who is reputed to have\r\nsmiled only twice in his life, once when his mother-in-law died and\r\nonce when he heard that the Swedish General Staff had referred to\r\ncertain military works outside Stockholm as a fortress. Applied to\r\nKemal, the story would hardly hold true for he has the gift of making\r\nhimself genuinely pleasant when he cares to exercise it. I can speak\r\nof it only in connection with the handful of Westerners who have lived\r\nin Angora during the last four years. Turkey has been not only Turkish\r\nbut desperately Turkish during these last years, yet no public\r\ncelebration of its victories has occurred in Angora without the\r\nhandful of Westerners in the town attending and without Kemal himself\r\nmaking an opportunity to receive them upon its conclusion. On these\r\noccasions, they have been received with a sensitive cordiality hardly\r\nunderstandable by those Westerners at home to whom it has never\r\noccurred that nations are born, not in debating societies, but in the\r\nmud and blood of suffering.\r\n\r\nKemal is, however, a professional soldier, dismissed from the old\r\nOttoman Army by the Damad Ferid Ministry in Constantinople and now\r\noccupying a politico-military position at the head of the new Turkish\r\nGovernment. He has brought to Angora the blunt directness of the\r\nsoldier rather than the statesman, and his remarkable personal\r\nprestige has colored his entire Government. Yet it is not sufficient\r\nto define him as a soldier. The head of the new Turkish State happens\r\nto be a soldier because the dominant tradition of the old Ottoman\r\nEmpire was the Turkish military tradition. In any country with a great\r\nmilitary tradition, the best brains of the country tend to flow into\r\nthe Army and the best brains of the Army tend to flow into the General\r\nStaff. Kemal reached the General Staff of the old Ottoman Army at a\r\ntime when the best brains in the country were attempting to carry it\r\nfrom those Eastern traditions of government in which it had had a long\r\nand rich experience, to the newer Western traditions at which it is\r\nstill serving its apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible to press down the difference between these two\r\ntraditions of government into the limits of a single sentence, it\r\nmight be said that the Eastern tradition is that of action and the\r\nWestern tradition is that of argument. Under the Eastern tradition,\r\ngovernment is centralized in a single ruler whose power is as nearly\r\nabsolute as his own personal abilities enable him to make it. Under\r\nthe Western tradition, the functions of government are decentralized\r\nand authority is carried down to a popular electorate, represented by\r\ndeputies in a parliament to which the Government of the day is\r\nimmediately responsible. Under the Eastern tradition, all things are\r\npossible to an individual ruler as long as he disposes of sufficient\r\nforce to impose them. Under the Western tradition, all things are\r\npossible to an electorate as long as it abstains from force in\r\nimposing them. London is the home of the modern Western tradition but\r\nto find the home of the Eastern tradition today it is necessary to go\r\nfarther east than Turkey, to a country like Afghanistan. One episode\r\nwhich illustrates the contrast between the two traditions, is that of\r\nan Afghan notable who happened to be in London at a time when the\r\nGovernment fell, and who lost no time in sending an _aide_ into the\r\nWest End to purchase arms with which to defend himself. For further\r\nillustration, I might draw on my own experience. I called on the\r\nAfghan Ambassador at Angora in the course of my stay there and\r\ndiscovered, I thought, an astonishing ignorance of our Western ways.\r\nHis was a charming tea, served by a charming gentleman who kept a\r\ncharming revolver on his desk throughout the period of our talk and\r\ntwo charmingly brawny Secretaries of Embassy close at hand in case, I\r\nsuppose, of emergency. It happened, however, that no emergency\r\ndeveloped and our talk of an hour’s duration ended as happily as it\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nBut if we Westerners have slowly built up our own peculiar traditions\r\nof government at home, we have not always carried them with us into\r\nthe East. In our contacts with Eastern peoples in their own lands, we\r\nhave tended to adopt the Eastern tradition. We have met force with\r\nforce and it is possibly difficult to blame the more provincial of\r\nEastern peoples if they conclude from their contacts with us along\r\ntheir own frontiers, that our traditions of government are the same as\r\ntheirs. We cherish at home the reign of law, but our imperialisms in\r\nthe East have not always exemplified our love of law. Probably their\r\nrelatively lawless nature has been justified by necessity, for the\r\ncomplicated machinery of Western trade demands conditions of security\r\nif it is to work smoothly. Doubtless imperialism which is the simplest\r\nmethod of affording it a degree of security, will continue as long as\r\nit is able to command superior force, although naturally it is a daily\r\nhumiliation to the strongest of Eastern peoples. Necessity will tend\r\nto justify its continuance until Easterners demonstrate that they can\r\nadapt our tradition of law to their own needs and that they are\r\nthemselves able to afford legitimate Western trade (not of the\r\nget-rich-quick sort) that security which it has a right to expect. It\r\nis this task of adapting the Western tradition of law to Eastern\r\nneeds, of substituting in the East a new and Eastern _regime_ of law\r\nfor the lawlessness of imperialism, while disturbing as little as\r\npossible the inter-flow of sound and legitimate trade――it is this task\r\nwhich constitutes the Turkish problem today.\r\n\r\nKemal is a Westerner who was born under the Eastern absolutism of\r\nAbdul Hamid. He has known the East, the West and that curious\r\noffspring of both of them, imperialism. He is the son of a country\r\nwhich has belonged in the past to any man who proved strong enough to\r\ntake it and which has rewarded its strong men with prestige or a cup\r\nof poison or both. He has been a consistent Young Turk, although his\r\nbeliefs once flung him out of his country in disgrace and later tossed\r\nhim the dying remnant of his country to do what he could with it. In\r\nhis unaffected bearing, he embodies the old Ottoman officer type at\r\nits best, and at its best that type was a very fine type indeed. He is\r\na great Turk and as a man among men he towers head and shoulders above\r\nthe type of man which our Western democracies have sometimes projected\r\ninto political life. A century from now, the historian of the future\r\nwill see him in a larger and more adequate perspective than we are\r\nable to look upon him as he moves among us today.\r\n\r\nHe resumed his chair behind the desk, with the green and gold banner\r\nhanging limply in the corner behind him, and took from his pocket a\r\nstring of amber beads with a brown tassel. His cheek bones are rather\r\nhigh, his nose is straight and strong, his mouth is straight and\r\nthin-lipped. I think a cartoonist would find him easy to do――a\r\ntowering iron-gray _kalpak_, and beneath it the straight strong lines\r\nof the eyebrows, the mouth and the chin. He wore an English shooting\r\nsuit of tweed, a gray soft collar with a gray tie, and high-laced tan\r\nboots with the short vamp which is native to the Near East.\r\nPhysically, he gives a lean, wiry impression.\r\n\r\nHe speaks either Turkish or French (he knows no English) in the\r\nmildest of tones, hardly above a whisper and with a blunt frankness\r\nwhich manages to remain free from any suggestion of truculence. I\r\nformed the impression that he does not find talk congenial; he says\r\nwhat needs to be said but he prefers to listen. Certainly he is quite\r\ndevoid of that love of talk which sometimes afflicts Western statesmen\r\nand which is one of the less beautiful aspects of our Western\r\ntradition of popular government. Like any other good soldier, there is\r\nnot the faintest trace of pose in him. He does not employ to\r\nWesterners the, to us, exaggerated courtesies of the East; when he\r\ndoes talk to us, he talks as we ourselves endeavor to talk to each\r\nother, with simplicity and directness. At one time in our talk, I\r\nasked him for photographs of himself since they were not then\r\nobtainable elsewhere in Angora and weeks afterward I happened to\r\nmention the matter to a Western friend in Constantinople. “What did he\r\ntell you?” “That he would have them sent me the next day.” “And did\r\nhe?” “Yes.” My friend thought it over; he has lived in Constantinople\r\nfor some thirty years. “If you can really get any Turk to give you a\r\ndefinite word on any subject under the sun without making you wait a\r\nmonth for it,” he said finally, “its fairly certain there’s been a\r\nrevolution in the country.”\r\n\r\nI had a feeling from the first that I was talking to an iron image,\r\nthat his brain was miles away busying itself with a thousand and one\r\naffairs. He had a manner of dismissing question with question as\r\nthough he were very busy but desired not to be discourteous, and the\r\nheaped-up pile of papers on his very neat and orderly desk made it\r\nprobable that this was precisely the case. I changed my tactics\r\nfinally and began firing questions at him abruptly, determined to get\r\nhis undivided attention. He reached up suddenly with a gesture which\r\nmight have savored slightly of impatience, and flung aside his\r\n_kalpak_, revealing a tall sloping forehead, fringed at the top with\r\nvery thin brown hair, a forehead totally out of keeping with the\r\nseverely simple lines of his face. If his face is the iron face of the\r\ncavalry officer, his forehead is the forehead of the statesman.\r\n\r\nI kept on firing questions at him until I felt that his brain had\r\npaused at its distance to listen. I continued to fire questions at him\r\nuntil I felt that his brain had turned, had rushed down from its\r\ndistance and was sitting intently behind those fixed blue eyes,\r\nstaring out at its questioner:\r\n\r\n“Suppose Turkey’s Western population leaves the country _en masse_\r\nwhen it becomes certain that the Capitulations are ended?”\r\n\r\n“The West can help us or hinder us greatly,” he said, “but it ought to\r\nbe remembered that we Turks have our own problem to work out in\r\nTurkey.”\r\n\r\n“Just what do you mean by your own problem?”\r\n\r\n“You have seen the country, you know the condition in which Turkey is.\r\nOur villages, our towns, our communications, all need to be built anew\r\nfrom the ground up. We have had a good Army in times past. I don’t\r\nbelieve there has been a better Army in Europe. But we hope soon to be\r\nable to demobilize and then our real work will begin. We shall have a\r\npotentially rich country on our hands and we shall have the right\r\nwhich we have not had recently, to do what we can with it. We want to\r\nmake it a country worthy of its name, we want to give it not only the\r\nbest its own civilization offers it but the best we can take from\r\nother civilizations. To that end, we shall welcome the help of others\r\nbut in the very nature of our task, any help we secure from others\r\nmust be subordinated to our own efforts. If we can not succeed, nobody\r\nelse can.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think you will succeed?”\r\n\r\n“If you will come back two years after the peace, you will see what\r\nsort of beginning we have made.”\r\n\r\nWhen my time was up, I left him and walked back in silence to my\r\nrooms. I dispatched the aged Armenian maid after tea, took off my\r\nshoes and donned my slippers. I felt somewhat as a man does when he\r\nhas seen a great cavalry charge and has returned to his billet and\r\ntaken his boots off. I became aware finally of the squeak of ox-carts\r\nbeneath my windows. A long string of them was passing on its 300-mile\r\ntrek up from the coast to the Army bases in the interior. The air was\r\nfilled with their slow screaming squeak, a squeak which with infinite\r\ndeliberation removed the skin from every note in the chromatic scale,\r\nthe squeak of wooden axles daubed with tar to tickle the musical\r\npalates of a team of oxen. Each cart, a mere wooden platform mounted\r\non wooden wheels, bore a tall mound of hay for the oxen and beneath\r\nthe hay the rope-handled ends of two or four or six new wooden boxes\r\nprotruded, the number of boxes depending on the _calibre_ of the\r\nshells within. Most of the drivers were Turkish peasant women,\r\njacketed and pantalooned, their feet shod in rope-bound woollens,\r\ntheir faces and hands reddened by exposure. Dead men’s fathers and\r\nsons and brothers in the Army, widows and dead men’s daughters behind\r\nthe Army――but still the rope-handled boxes squeaked up from the sea….\r\n\r\nIt is out of the dumb stubborn strength of this peasantry that the\r\nTurkish military tradition has been fashioned in centuries past. But\r\ncan the Turks direct this strength from their native military\r\ntradition into a new and Western economic tradition? This is the\r\nquestion mark which hangs over the Turkish problem today and Kemal\r\nknows it.\r\n\r\n“Do you think you will succeed?” I had asked him.\r\n\r\n“If you will come back two years after the peace, you will see what\r\nsort of beginning we have made.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE OLD OTTOMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nKEMAL’S BIRTH AT SALONICA――HOW HE BECAME A YOUNG TURK――WHAT THE OLD\r\nOTTOMAN EMPIRE WAS LIKE――THE DIVISION OF ITS POPULATION INTO RELIGIOUS\r\nCOMMUNITIES――THE WESTERN CHALLENGE OF ITS _Rûm_ (GREEK) COMMUNITY――ITS\r\nDUTY TO ISLAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nForty-two years ago, when Abdul Hamid II ruled in Constantinople and\r\nthe Ottoman Crescent and Star still floated over Salonica, an\r\nunderling in the Salonica customs office died, leaving his widow with\r\na small daughter and an infant son on her hands. The daughter in time\r\ngrew up and married, as is the way of Turkish daughters. The son was\r\nintended by his mother for the mosque school and the career of a\r\n_hoja_, as is the way of Turkish mothers, but he became fascinated by\r\nthe uniforms of the Ottoman Army officers whom he saw about the\r\nstreets, as is the way of Turkish sons. In time he succeeded in\r\npassing the examinations for the military preparatory school at\r\nSalonica, where his mathematics teacher became so fond of him that he\r\nleft off calling him by his given name of Mustapha and dubbed him\r\nKemal, a Turkish name meaning rightness.\r\n\r\nThe military preparatory school at Salonica, the officers’ school at\r\nMonastir and the War Academy at Constantinople finally graduated him,\r\na headstrong youth of 22, into the Army in 1902 with the rank of\r\nlieutenant. He had hardly reached the War Academy from Monastir before\r\nhis adolescent mind became tainted by the political ferment with which\r\nthe school was secretly permeated. A copy of the forbidden play\r\n_Watan_ (The Fatherland) fell into his hands. Abdul Hamid had caused\r\nevery known copy of it to be confiscated and burned; he had forced its\r\nauthor, despite his very high place in modern Turkish literature, to\r\nflee into exile; he had driven out of the capital every Ottoman\r\nsubject whom his spies suspected of having read it. But _Watan_ gave\r\nthe young Kemal his first taste of Western ideas and made him secretly\r\na Young Turk and a bitter opponent of Abdul Hamid, which at the time\r\nwas a rather ridiculous thing to be.\r\n\r\nAbdul Hamid was an able Easterner who maintained his grip on his\r\ncountry by such a system of espionage that the life and liberty of no\r\nOttoman subject was safe who was remotely suspected of having heard of\r\nthe French Revolution, a system of espionage which could not keep\r\nWestern ideas out of the capital but which could, and did, keep them\r\nunderground. The military tradition of the country continued to\r\nattract its best brains into the Army but the network of espionage\r\nwhich radiated from Yildiz Kiosk had the effect of giving the Army a\r\nsort of dual existence. On the surface, it continued to be a military\r\norganism, the trustee of an Eastern military tradition, but beneath\r\nthe surface it became a ferment of forbidden Western ideas and the\r\nexample of Nihilism in Russia which did much to spread the secret\r\nsociety craze, found no more fertile element to work upon than the\r\nyeasty mentality of the War Academy and the Military College of\r\nMedicine in Constantinople. So a secret political society which called\r\nitself the Society of Liberty was formed among the students at the War\r\nAcademy and a similar society, the Society of Progress, was launched\r\nacross the Bosphorus at the Military College of Medicine. But both\r\nwere mere seeds sprouting underground in the rich and rotting soil of\r\nthe capital. The country itself, outside the capital, was still a\r\nprimitive Eastern land ruled by any man who proved himself strong\r\nenough to take it.\r\n\r\nThere were some 600,000 square miles in the old Ottoman Empire when\r\nAbdul Hamid came to the Throne. It was a compact area, lying at the\r\njunction of three continents. On the west, it ran deeply into the\r\nBalkans in Europe; on the east, it extended into Trans-Caucasia and\r\ndown the frontier of Old Persia in Asia; on the south, it followed the\r\nArabian coast of the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean and crossed to the\r\nAfrican coast to include a waning sovereignty over Egypt. In the\r\nBalkans and Asia Minor, it consisted of a mountainous _massif_ tilting\r\nup to the high plateau of Trans-Caucasia, its slopes dotted with\r\nisolated villages quite out of effective touch with any Government\r\nwhich might exist in Constantinople. Only the larger villages had a\r\n_gendarmerie_ post, fewer still had a telegraph key to connect them\r\nwith the provincial capital and throughout most of the country such\r\nWestern contrivances as railroads were wholly unknown. With the\r\ncountry’s administration rigidly centralized in Constantinople, only\r\nthe high prestige of the _Padishah_ linked these scattered villages in\r\ntheir loosely organized provinces.\r\n\r\nSouth of Asia Minor, the mountains dipped into a great desert arched\r\nby the Tigris-Euphrates basin on the east and by the green Syrian\r\ncorridor on the west. Here, except in the Syrian corridor, the\r\ninaccessibility of the country from Constantinople and the nomadic\r\nnature of its sparse population gave the provincial administrations a\r\ndegree of semi-independence which increased to complete independence\r\ndown in the Arabian peninsula. The case of the Syrian corridor was\r\nexceptional, however. Compared with the distant Tigris-Euphrates\r\nbasin, it was easily accessible from Constantinople; it was the home\r\nof a settled population with a very high culture of its own; and it\r\nwas on the only line of land communication with the most venerable\r\nholy places of Islam, the _Haram-esh-Sherif_ at Jerusalem, the\r\nProphet’s Tomb at Medina and the sacred _Kaaba_ at Mecca. The first of\r\nthese lay at the southern end of the corridor and the other two amid\r\nthe arid mountains which parallel the Arabian coast of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nOver these 600,000 square miles of country, the Sultan at\r\nConstantinople maintained the loosest sort of government, permitting\r\nhis subjects to conduct their own affairs largely in their own ways\r\nand confining his administration to the task of keeping the trade\r\nroutes open and the taxes collected, for under the Eastern tradition\r\nthis was the whole duty of government. There were about 25,000,000 of\r\nhis subjects, the overwhelming majority of them Moslems. The great\r\nMoslem reformation had swept the entire area centuries ago, but in\r\naccordance with the tolerance prescribed by the Prophet, Christians\r\nand Jews, while set aside in their own community organizations as\r\ndissenters, had been allowed to worship in their own ways. This was\r\nquite in accord with the loose Eastern idea of government which\r\npermitted every man to go his own way as long he paid his taxes\r\nregularly and refrained from disturbing the peace of the country. Even\r\nforeigners were likewise set apart under the Capitulations and were\r\npermitted to govern themselves under their own laws and customs.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, the Sultan’s administration of his country from\r\nConstantinople was very much like the King’s administration of his\r\nrealm from London. Both the Ottoman Sultan and the British King were\r\nthe heads of the dominant faiths in their respective countries. The\r\nSultans had become Caliphs of Islam in 1517, although not all Moslems\r\nrecognize them as such, just as the British Kings had become Defenders\r\nof the Faith in 1521, although not all Christians recognize them as\r\nsuch. The Sultan administered the spiritual affairs of his country\r\nthrough the _Sheikh-ul-Islam_ and its temporal affairs through the\r\n_Grand Vizier_, just as the King in London administers the spiritual\r\naffairs of his realm through the Archbishop of Canterbury and its\r\ntemporal affairs through the Prime Minister. The surface of both\r\ncountries is feudal and mediaeval, and springs from the same source,\r\nbut their resemblance in the reign of Abdul Hamid II stopped at the\r\nsurface. Beneath the surface, England during the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century, was in a state of transition from feudalism to the\r\nmodern Western idea of democracy. A growing industrial plant was\r\ngiving rise to trade unions and trade unions, exerting a growing\r\ninfluence on ideas of government, were drawing authority down to a\r\npopular electorate. Government was tightening its hold on the lowliest\r\npeasant and a civil service was being formed as a permanent body to\r\nwhich the increasing duties of government were entrusted. The country\r\nwas becoming a powerful industrial unit, able to mobilize the vast new\r\nenergies which machinery was opening up to it. It was embarking on\r\nmanufacture and trade on such a scale as had never been dreamed of\r\nbefore. It was becoming the ganglion of a financial nervous system\r\nwhose sensitive fibres covered the world. The old religious aspect of\r\ngovernment was dwindling and in its place we saw a drilled and\r\ndisciplined industrialism taking form beneath the feudal trappings\r\nwhich still constitute the surface of British government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUSSEIN RAUF BEY\r\n\r\nHead of the Ottoman Delegation which signed the Mudros Armistice,\r\nOctober, 1918; Nationalist Party Leader in the Ottoman Chamber,\r\nJanuary and February, 1920; arrested and deported to Malta, March 16,\r\n1920; Minister of Public Works and Prime Minister of the First Grand\r\nNational Assembly after his return from Malta in November, 1921.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL RAFET PASHA\r\n\r\nMinister of War and Interior of the First Grand National Assembly\r\nuntil November, 1921; Minister of War until January, 1922; Governor of\r\nEastern Thrace since November, 1922.]\r\n\r\nBut when Abdul Hamid II ascended the Ottoman Throne at Constantinople,\r\nreligion was still the dominant factor in his primitive and loosely\r\norganized country. From its surface to its core, the Ottoman Empire\r\nwas still Eastern. The Moslem community was still the governing\r\ncommunity, a community with a profound self-respect and a knowledge of\r\nits own duties as well as of the deference which was due to it. The\r\ndissenting communities were exempt by Moslem law from the duty of\r\npreserving the peace and hence were able frequently to attain a degree\r\nof prosperity which many Moslems never knew. Since the bulk of the\r\nSultan’s revenue was obtained from taxation provided for in Moslem\r\nlaw, foreigners, most of whom were Christians, were naturally exempt\r\nfrom the payment of any but secular taxes such as land tax and customs\r\nduties. We Westerners think of it today as a hopelessly mediaeval\r\nmethod of governing a country, but we sometimes forget that it\r\npermitted every man in the country a generous liberty which we in the\r\nWest have lost. It exemplified the Eastern tradition at its best and\r\nif we in the West have won for ourselves the blessings of modern\r\nindustrialism, we have paid for them with a considerable share of the\r\nliberties we once enjoyed. What larger liberties our new industrial\r\ndemocracies may yet confer upon us in exchange for the liberties they\r\nhave taken from us, remain to be seen. We are still evolving our\r\nWestern tradition of government, but at present it has taken from us\r\nfeudalism and the open fields and given us in exchange democracy and\r\nthe machine-shop.\r\n\r\nEven before Abdul Hamid II came to the Throne, the Western tradition\r\nhad begun to make itself felt in the old Empire, for it was obvious\r\nthat Western industrialism would succeed eventually in generating such\r\npower that no non-industrial country could stand against it. The\r\ndisturbing lure of the Western tradition was heightened by the\r\nreligious element, for both Islam and Christendom, while divided\r\nwithin themselves, tend to draw together when menaced from without.\r\nThe Islamic world found its political leadership in Constantinople,\r\nits scholastic leadership in Cairo and its juridical leadership in\r\nMecca, and it was natural that it should resent any menace to the old\r\nOttoman Empire within whose frontiers these three centers of\r\nleadership lay. At the same time, the memory of the great Moslem\r\nreformation had not yet passed from Christendom and it was natural\r\nthat it should resent the fact of Moslem rule over Palestine and the\r\ninferior position necessarily accorded to Christian communities in a\r\nMoslem country. There were a number of these Christian communities in\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, but we shall confine ourselves here to the mention\r\nof the two of them which most vitally concern us――the _Rûm_ community\r\nwhich included all members of the powerful Orthodox Church who\r\nrecognized the Oecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople, and the\r\n_Ermeni_ community or the Gregorian Church, a small but historic sect\r\nwhose membership was limited to Armenians. Both these communities were\r\nexempt from the operation of Moslem law and subject instead to their\r\nown Christian laws. Both were officially established and represented\r\nin the Sultan’s Government, the Oecumenical Patriarch himself\r\nrepresenting the _Rûm_ community and the _Ermeni_ community, since the\r\nseat of its _Catholicos_ is in Trans-Caucasia, being represented by a\r\nPatriarch appointed for the purpose in Constantinople. These\r\ncommunities included most of the Christians who had survived the great\r\nMoslem reformation and on the whole they lived quite peaceably under\r\nMoslem rule. While their Moslem neighbors formed the governing class,\r\nthey formed the trading class and in any feudal country trading is the\r\noccupation of the lower class. Still, their ablest men were frequently\r\nutilized by the Sultan in the government of the country and when they\r\nwere so utilized, they were called upon quite without reference to\r\ntheir position as religious dissenters, just as Nonconformists,\r\nCatholics and Jews are utilized in the British Government without\r\nreference to their attitude toward the Church of England.\r\n\r\nIt was through the Greeks, as the _Rûm_ community is called in the\r\nWest, that the Western tradition of government was first introduced\r\ninto the Ottoman Empire. They introduced it in its crudest form, a\r\nform in which the basis of the State was shifted from religion to\r\nrace. The Greeks of Old Greece revolted successfully in the 1820’s and\r\nwere immediately recognized by the West as an independent State. But a\r\ncurious feature of their State was that it contained none of the\r\nprovisions for reasonably secure dissent which had marked the Empire.\r\nAlthough the modern Greeks were without experience in the government\r\nof dissenters, the West gave them immediate and full control over\r\ntheir entire population without community organizations for dissenters\r\nor Capitulations for foreigners. We Christians appear to be\r\ncharacterized by this inability to tolerate dissent. Once we were\r\nburning dissenters at the stake and today, although we have won\r\nreligious liberty for ourselves in the West, we have not even yet\r\nsucceeded in looking upon all religions and all races with the broad\r\ntolerance which distinguishes Islam.\r\n\r\nThe revolt of the Old Greeks disturbed the peaceful relations which\r\nhad existed between the Sultan and his _Rûm_ community, but not as\r\nviolently as might have been expected. In time it disturbed Moslem\r\nminds, for if this Western emphasis upon race were to gain any headway\r\nin the Empire, there was literally no end to the amount of disruption\r\nit could effect. As a country inhabited by 18,000,000 Moslems,\r\n5,000,000 Christians and a scattering of lesser faiths, the internal\r\nlife of the Empire had been generally peaceful and not ignoble, but if\r\nits population were to be changed over into a matter of 9,000,000\r\nTurks, 8,000,000 Arabs, 2,000,000 Greeks, 2,000,000 Kurds, 1,500,000\r\nArmenians, etc., all of them inter-tangling into each other, the\r\nprospect of trouble was limitless, not only for the Turks themselves\r\nbut for every race in the country.\r\n\r\nTo the Greeks of Old Greece, the new Westernism offered the prospect\r\nof a reversal of the subordinate position they had occupied ever since\r\nthe Moslem reformation had all but swept Christianity out of existence\r\nin the very land of its origin, and this prospect was heightened by\r\nthe increasing territorial losses which the Ottoman Empire had\r\nsuffered for two centuries. The same prospect made itself quickly felt\r\nthroughout the West, a fact which may afford evidence that the unity\r\nof Christendom is greater than it appears to be on the surface, for\r\nsurely there can be no greater contrast within the limits of a single\r\nfaith than the contrast between the rich and decadent ritual of\r\nOrthodoxy on one hand and the Spartan simplicity of British\r\nNon-conformism and American Protestantism on the other.\r\n\r\nBut the challenge which the Greeks had found it comparatively easy to\r\nfling down, was far from easy for the governing Moslems of the Empire\r\nto pick up. In the first place, they had built the Empire to the\r\nspecifications of their own Moslem law and in the second place, quite\r\nirrespective of any wishes they might have had in the matter, they\r\nbore a heavy responsibility to the rest of Islam for their faithful\r\nstewardship of that law. It had come to a time when the Empire was one\r\nof the very few Moslem States which were able to interpret Moslem law\r\nindependently of external pressure, and Islam looked as it had never\r\nlooked before to its political leadership in Constantinople and its\r\njuridical leadership in Mecca. The Sultan was the trustee of that\r\nvenerable Eastern civilization which was Islam’s own. The Caliphate\r\nwhich Selim the Grim had lightly taken at Cairo in 1517, when Islam\r\nwas powerful, was now in the days of Islam’s political decline,\r\nbecoming an actual and heavy responsibility. The position was not a\r\nhopeless one, for Indian Moslems who comprise some of the best brains\r\nin Islam, had shown in their accommodation to the fact of British\r\nIndia, that Moslem law is not inflexible. But for Moslems both within\r\nand without the Empire, the challenge which the Old Greeks had flung\r\ndown, produced a position about as serious as can be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Empire was becoming the cockpit of an enormous arena whose\r\nslopes extended from the back hills of Java to the country towns of\r\nthe United States. With the eyes of this worldwide audience upon them,\r\na handful of Young Turks in Constantinople were beginning secretly to\r\ngrope about after a way out of the apparent _impasse_ in which they\r\nfound themselves, after some formula which should adapt the Empire,\r\nnot to the hothouse Westernism of the Old Greeks, but to the maturer\r\nand healthier Westernism of England. Luckily, the fact of India’s\r\n70,000,000 Moslems had thrown the Caliph of Islam in Constantinople\r\nand the Emperor of India in London into intimate contact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG TURKISH PROGRAM\r\n\r\nKEMAL’S ARREST AND HIS EXILE TO DAMASCUS――HIS EVENTUAL RETURN TO\r\nSALONICA――WHAT THE YOUNG TURKS WANTED――THE RELIGIOUS CONSERVATISM\r\nWHICH CONFRONTED THEM――THE ROLE OF AMERICAN MISSIONARIES AND\r\nEDUCATORS――CHRISTENDOM VS. ISLAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young Kemal had no sooner been graduated from the General Staff\r\nclasses at the War Academy in Constantinople, than he engaged a small\r\napartment in Stamboul to serve as the headquarters of the secret\r\nSociety of Liberty. But an acquaintance whom he trusted and whom he\r\npermitted to sleep in the apartment at night on the plea that he was\r\npenniless, proved to be one of Abdul Hamid’s spies and Kemal was\r\narrested. Having been questioned at Yildiz Kiosk, he was held for\r\nthree months in a police cell and then exiled late in 1902 to a\r\ncavalry regiment in Damascus. Fresh from the War Academy, fired with\r\nthe spirit of revolution and schooled in its _technique_, he lost no\r\ntime at Damascus in getting into touch with other exiles from the War\r\nAcademy and the Military College of Medicine in the capital. His\r\ncolonel, Lutfi Bey, introduced him to the keeper of a small stationery\r\nshop in the Damascus bazaars who had been exiled from the College of\r\nMedicine, and the two of them secretly organized a branch of the\r\nSociety of Liberty among the officers of the garrison. Under the\r\nsupposed necessity of his military duties, Kemal was soon dispatched\r\nto Jaffa and Jerusalem where similar branches were organised, the\r\nJaffa branch attaining considerable strength. He soon became\r\nconvinced, however, that work in Syria was a mistake, that if the\r\nchallenge of Westernism which Old Greece had flung down was ever to be\r\npicked up, it would have to be picked up where it had been flung down.\r\n\r\nThe political life of the Empire centered in Constantinople, but the\r\nespionage system which radiated from Yildiz had the capital so\r\ncompletely in its grip that revolutionary work there was subject to\r\nthe greatest dangers. Outside of the capital, the life of the Empire\r\nwas divided into two categories, that of the coast towns and that of\r\nthe interior. The life of the former was in a sort of touch with the\r\noutside world, but the provincial capitals of the interior were quite\r\nself-sufficient. Smyrna, the greatest of all the coast towns, was in\r\ntouch with all the outside world, but it was confronted in the\r\ninterior by Konia whose historic dervish _tekkes_ were a well of Islam\r\nundefiled. It was the _tchelebi_ of the Mevlevi dervishes at Konia who\r\ngirded each new Caliph with the Prophet’s sword forty days after his\r\naccession to the Throne, and when proud Konia spoke, its voice was\r\nweighted with all the venerable conservatism of Islam.\r\n\r\nBut in Europe the coast town of Salonica was faced by no such\r\nconservatism in its hinterland. The raw turbulent races of the Balkans\r\nwere already in a ferment of Westernism and in their grim way were\r\npreparing to disentangle themselves in the wake of the retreating\r\nEmpire. Salonica, Uskub and Monastir were already seething with\r\nforbidden political ideas and if the Empire were ever to halt its\r\nretreat, it was here it would have to make its peace with Westernism.\r\nIt was here that Old Greece had flung down its challenge and it was\r\nhere that challenge would have to be picked up. Furthermore, if any\r\nforce were to be mobilized to thrust Westernism upon Abdul Hamid in\r\nConstantinople, it was from Salonica that it would inevitably be\r\nlaunched.\r\n\r\nKemal accordingly abandoned his work in Syria and induced Lutfi Bey to\r\ngive him leave under an assumed name to Smyrna, intending to make his\r\nway from there to Salonica. Fearing, however, that Constantinople\r\nwould detect his presence in Smyrna, he went to Egypt instead and\r\nsailed from Alexandria to the Piraeus, whence he reached Salonica.\r\nConstantinople was coming more and more completely into the grip of\r\nAbdul Hamid. The General Staff was being periodically broken up and\r\nscattered to the four corners of the Empire, and the Military College\r\nof Medicine was finally locked up and abandoned. Hamid was beginning\r\nin similar fashion to tighten his grip on Salonica and, although Kemal\r\nremained there in strictest hiding, his presence was discovered after\r\nfour months and he fled precipitately to Jaffa, where a convenient\r\noutbreak of “trouble” at Akaba on the Red Sea gave him an alibi which\r\nserved to soothe the ruffled feelings of the capital. From Akaba he\r\nwent back to Damascus and waited there until a change of War Ministers\r\nin Constantinople made it possible for him to request, and secure, a\r\ntransfer to the Staff of the Third Army at Salonica. Back in Salonica\r\nagain, he threw himself into the work of the secret Young Turkish\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nA little group of Ottoman exiles in Paris of whom Ahmed Riza Bey was\r\nthe leader, had discovered the formula which was to achieve that\r\ninternal unity which the Empire had long enjoyed and without which no\r\nEmpire could endure. It was the formula of Ottomanization. “A new\r\nOttoman Empire one and indivisible” was their dream, an expression\r\nwhich they had borrowed from the French Revolution. “Oh, non-Moslem\r\nOttomans――Oh, Moslem Ottomans” was their program. All the races of the\r\nEmpire were to be drawn together into “a new nation,” “a new Ottoman\r\nEmpire,” whose military strength would enable it to halt its long\r\nretreat and put an end to interference in its internal affairs from\r\nwithout. To Riza Bey, Moslems and Christians alike were sufferers\r\nunder Abdul Hamid’s Easternism. The restoration of the still-born\r\nConstitution of thirty years before, was his objective; with the\r\nConstitution restored, Moslems and Christians would enjoy alike the\r\nrights and the duties of Ottoman citizenship. Moslems would no longer\r\nsuffer in silence. Christians would no longer lift their complaints\r\nthroughout Europe and the United States. “We shall no longer be\r\nslaves, but a new Ottoman nation of freemen.”\r\n\r\nThis was the ideal which Riza Bey lifted up in the little\r\nrevolutionary periodical _Mechveret_ which was smuggled into every\r\ngarrison in the Empire from his little flat in the Place Monge, near\r\nthe Montmarte section of Paris. This was the ideal which young Turks\r\nlike Enver and Niazi and Kemal were propagating, as they built up the\r\nsecret organization which was to compel Abdul Hamid to restore the\r\nConstitution. Throughout the Empire, they had their agents in every\r\ngarrison, converting both the officers and the enlisted personnel of\r\nAbdul Hamid’s Army, and assassinating hostile officers and men known\r\nto be spies. Small organizing committees had been planted in all the\r\nlarger garrisons and directing committees were functioning in\r\nConstantinople, Salonica, Smyrna, Adrianople, Uskub and Monastir.\r\nUnder the Eastern tradition of government, it was the Army which\r\nimmediately mattered. Deprived of his Army, Abdul Hamid for the moment\r\nwould be caught defenseless.\r\n\r\nBut in reality the Army was only the instrument of Abdul Hamid’s\r\npower. The substance of his power lay in Moslem law and in the\r\nunswerving devotion to it of the Old Turks. Strong simple men, these\r\nOld Turks were, men who knew nothing of the arts of debate, broadly\r\ntolerant of the usages of others and rigidly conservative of their own\r\nusages, men who took their starkly simple faith very seriously, in\r\nwhose lives religion was still the dominating factor. They were found\r\nin the mosque schools rather than in the War Academy, in Konia rather\r\nthan in Salonica, and in winning over the Army, the Young Turks were\r\nnot touching the vast and silent body of conservative Old Turkish\r\nopinion which formed Abdul Hamid’s real strength. Here was a dead\r\nweight of usage which knew no necessity for change and which would\r\nhave resisted to the end if it had. True, there was a section of Old\r\nTurkish opinion in the capital and the larger provincial centers,\r\nwhich disliked Abdul Hamid the Sultan, but Abdul Hamid the Caliph was\r\nquite another matter. Under the Caliph, Moslem and non-Moslem were\r\n_not_ equal. Non-Moslems had been given far more tolerant treatment\r\nunder the Caliph than religious dissenters had sometimes been given\r\nunder Christian rule in the West, but the tolerance which the Caliph\r\nguaranteed them did not make them the equals of Moslems.\r\n\r\nWhether Moslem law was really thus inflexible was obviously a matter\r\nfor Moslems themselves to determine, but the record of India’s Moslems\r\nin accommodating themselves to British rule would have seemed to\r\nindicate otherwise. India’s Moslems, however, were in touch with the\r\nWestern world as the Old Turks were not. The very fact of British\r\nrule, not to mention their long contact with Hindus, had given India’s\r\nMoslems a breadth of vision which Old Turkish opinion lacked. Old\r\nTurkish leadership embodied Islam at its best, but in the range of its\r\nexperience it embodied Islam at its narrowest.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the _Rûm_ community whose relations with the Sultan-Caliph\r\nwere still generally peaceful, had a very large source of strength\r\noutside the Empire. Had the Young Turks eventually proved successful\r\nin equalizing Moslem and non-Moslem in an Ottoman citizenry, the _Rûm_\r\ncommunity might or might not have accepted the change and undertaken\r\nto work the newly Ottomanized Empire. But if the Young Turks failed,\r\nthere were sources of outside strength available to the Oecumenical\r\nPatriarchate in Constantinople which would have broken the Old Turks\r\nby force and substituted a new _regime_ which might be described as\r\nOld Greek. The old Byzantine Empire had been snuffed out as an\r\nindependent political entity in 1453, but it still lived as an\r\necclesiastical, commercial and political force in the Oecumenical\r\nPatriarchate in the Phanar suburb of Stamboul. Its clergy still\r\nperpetuated its memory in the black cylindrical hats and the black\r\nrobes of Orthodoxy, but for the time being their communicants wore the\r\nred _fez_ which marked the Ottoman subject.\r\n\r\nThe King at Athens whence the challenge of Westernism had first been\r\nflung down to the Empire, had adopted the title of King of the Greeks\r\nand Orthodoxy dominated Old Greece with a degree of intolerance which\r\nhad never marked Islam in the Empire. Orthodoxy had established its\r\nhold on Russia and Orthodox Russia had become the most powerful enemy\r\nIslam had ever known. Russia had acquired the protectorship of the\r\n_Rûm_ community in the Empire and the great yellow-brown mosque of\r\n_Ayiah Sophia_ in Stamboul had become the most sacred irredentum of\r\nthe Orthodox. Russia sent thousands of pilgrims annually from Odessa\r\nto Palestine, and built a hospice on the Mount of Olives which\r\ncommands Jerusalem in a military sense, with a tower which could not\r\nhave been better adapted for the uses of a signal tower if it had been\r\nbuilt for the purpose. Between Orthodoxy and Islam, there had arisen\r\nthat state of bitter truce which was typified in the juxtaposition of\r\na Russian church and a Turkish _serai_.\r\n\r\nFrance which had divorced Church and State at home, still held the\r\nprotectorship of the _Katolik_ community in the Ottoman Empire. Italy\r\nwhose relations with the Vatican at home had not always been friendly\r\nclung tenaciously to the rights of Italian Catholic orders in\r\nPalestine. Germany whose Lutherans had no specified rights in the\r\nChristian holy places and whose Kaiser had proclaimed himself the\r\nfriend of Islam, had planted stronger colonies in Palestine and more\r\nbuildings in Jerusalem than any other Western Power, and had built a\r\nhospice on the Mount of Olives “strengthened” by a wall which could\r\nhardly have been better adapted for the uses of military defense if it\r\nhad been built for the purpose. So we had a city sacred to Moslems,\r\nChristians and Jews, dominated by Russian and German hospices on the\r\nMount of Olives, strong fortress-like structures erected _ad gloriam\r\nmaiorem Dei_. Meanwhile the Caliph of Islam continued to administer\r\nthe city with fairness to the communicants of all three faiths,\r\nkeeping his garrison down at Jaffa on the coast except on the\r\noccasions of such religious festivals as required its temporary\r\npresence in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nOne expects from American Protestantism and British Nonconformism an\r\nattitude of aloofness from this sort of thing, for both have revolted\r\nagainst the use of the Church by the State. Both have revolted against\r\nthat ritualism which marks the older forms of Christianity and have\r\nset up for themselves a form of service severely simple and\r\naggressively evangelical. In accordance with the finest of its\r\nevangelical traditions, American Protestantism has carried on a long\r\nand vigorous missionary endeavor in the old Ottoman Empire, but actual\r\ncontact with Islam in its own country has done much to make plain to\r\nthe missionaries themselves the reasons for the great Moslem\r\nreformation which all but swept Christianity out of existence in the\r\nland of its origin. Whatever may have been thought in the United\r\nStates as to the work in which American missionaries have been engaged\r\nin the Empire, that work has been directed towards the reformation of\r\nthe decadent survivals of Christian worship. The missionaries\r\nthemselves, as distinct from their supporters in the United States,\r\nhave rightly observed that Christianity will not command the respect\r\nof Islam until Moslems have been shown a different type of Christian\r\nfrom that type to which they have been accustomed. The missionaries\r\naccordingly, beginning on one of the outermost fringes of Christendom,\r\nhave devoted themselves to work largely among the Armenians and have\r\ndrawn away from their Gregorian Church a new community which the\r\nCaliph in Constantinople recognized as the _Prodesdan_ community.\r\n\r\nBut an important circumstance exists which is inevitably present in\r\nany missionary endeavor in an alien land and of which we sometimes\r\nneed to remind ourselves. In actual practice, Islam is not only a\r\nreligion but a form of civilization as well and, in the life of any\r\ndevout Moslem, it would be very difficult to say where the one ends\r\nand the other begins. Precisely the same is true of American\r\nProtestantism. It might be simple enough to state the theology of\r\nAmerican Protestantism, but that theology would fall far short of\r\ndefining the actual missionary. For the missionary is not only a\r\nProtestant but an American as well, and in any alien country he\r\nembodies the American Protestant form of civilization. However rigidly\r\nhe may seek to confine his work within the limits of religious\r\nteaching (and I am thoroughly convinced that the overwhelming majority\r\nof missionaries have so sought to confine their work in the Ottoman\r\nEmpire), it is impossible for him not to be an American and a center\r\nof American ideas. In actual practice, it proved impossible for him\r\nnot to stand as a center of Westernism in an Eastern country to which\r\nthe application of Western ideas necessitated the utmost caution. The\r\nArmenians among whom most of the missionaries worked, were the\r\nfarthest East of all the Ottoman peoples and among the non-Moslem\r\ncommunities they were the last to respond to the Western lure. For\r\ncenturies they have lived generally in peace under the Caliph’s rule.\r\nThemselves an Eastern people, they had lived under their Eastern\r\nmasters in the enjoyment of the autonomy of their community\r\ninstitutions. The terms under which the _Ermeni_ community conducted\r\nits own affairs in its own way, were the only terms under which they\r\ncould have enjoyed the degree of autonomy which they did enjoy, for\r\nthey had a majority in no province[1] and the Western idea presupposes\r\na majority as the first requisite of independence.\r\n\r\nIf Christian worship as it was practiced in the Ottoman Empire was\r\never to command the respect of Moslems, in theory it was all to the\r\ngood that the missionaries should draw their new Protestant community\r\nout of the old Gregorian Church. But that the Armenians should be\r\nexposed incautiously to Western ideas of nationalism was quite another\r\nmatter. Events might have worked out differently had the missionaries\r\nbeen able to lay aside their Americanism, had they became Ottoman\r\nsubjects themselves and confined their work to the propagation of\r\nProtestantism under Ottoman rule. But this sort of thing is not done.\r\nWithout the steadying influence of responsibility to the Ottoman\r\nGovernment, they permitted their work to take them into the most\r\nintimate and delicate parts of the Ottoman structure. Their attitude\r\ntoward the Ottoman Government was that of the Capitulations, their\r\nonly responsibility was to their American supporters at home to whom\r\nthe Ottoman Government was as far away as the moon.\r\n\r\nNobody has ever expected American missionaries in the Ottoman Empire\r\nto become Ottoman subjects. Indeed, nothing could have made such a\r\nproceeding more ridiculous than the mere mention of it, and I am\r\ninclined to believe that in the very ridicule which its mention would\r\nhave provoked, there is food for very sober reflection. Among\r\nimperialists, one can thoroughly understand such an attitude, for\r\nimperialism is based on force and prestige is the very necessary\r\nlegend of the invincibility of Western force. But do we Christians\r\nalso build on force?\r\n\r\nYet the history of Old Greece is by no means an isolated instance of\r\nintolerance in modern Christendom. We Christians have built a world in\r\nwhich only Christian nations are admitted to equality (the recent\r\nexample of Japan to the contrary notwithstanding). Old Greece and Old\r\nRussia we have recognized as complete equals with us and if the\r\nArmenians had gained their independence, presumably we would have\r\nrecognized Armenia also as an equal, although every American\r\nmissionary who knows the Armenians in their own country knows what\r\ntheir abilities are. But forgetting that the true worth of a nation\r\nlies in character, we have never recognized Moslem nations as equals\r\nwith us. We found in the Turks a people of integrity and tolerance,\r\nbut because they refused to turn Christian, we have concurred in the\r\nmodern Capitulations and have visited the butcher-legend upon them\r\nwhile exalting Greeks and Armenians upon an equally artificial\r\nmartyr-legend. Among imperialists, one can understand the necessity of\r\nan inflexible attitude of superiority, but among Christians it\r\ncorresponds neither to reality nor to the teachings of the First\r\nChristian.\r\n\r\n“And he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves\r\nthat they were righteous, and set all others at nought: Two men went\r\nup into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a\r\npublican. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I\r\nthank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust,\r\nadulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week; I give\r\ntithes of all that I get. But the publican, standing afar off, would\r\nnot lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast,\r\nsaying, God, be Thou merciful to me a sinner. I say unto you, this man\r\nwent down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one\r\nthat exalteth himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself\r\nshall be exalted…”\r\n\r\nThe missionaries remained Americans as well as Protestants. They\r\nadministered Westernism as well as Protestantism to the Armenians, and\r\nthe result of the administration of Westernism was bloodshed. The\r\nexample of Nihilism in Russia lured the Armenians on into the secret\r\nsociety craze. Armenian revolutionary societies answered bloodshed\r\nwith more bloodshed, and the tragedy began whose ghastly fruition we\r\nhave seen.\r\n\r\nSome of the missionaries recoiled from further missionary effort and\r\nopened schools and hospitals instead which they threw open impartially\r\nto all the races of the Empire. These schools were instituted solely\r\nfor educational purposes and the largest of them offered as good a\r\nschooling as most American colleges in the United States offered.\r\nTheir effort was to offer the best that Americans at home had and even\r\nin such incidentals as the architecture of their buildings, they made\r\nthemselves as completely American as possible. Two of the largest of\r\nthem were built high on the wooded shores of the Bosphorus and nobody\r\ncan glance at them today without knowing at once that they are\r\nAmerican. High above the suburbs of the old capital, they look as if\r\nthey had been transported bodily from Chicago.\r\n\r\nOne can share our pride in our own devices and our own customs, one\r\ncan sympathize in our desire to see other countries adapt themselves\r\nto American methods, but it was not the effort of these schools to\r\nstrike a balance between American and Ottoman cultures. What these\r\nschools offered was out-and-out Americanism and their attitude toward\r\nthe Ottoman Government was the sharply aloof attitude of the\r\nCapitulations. This was obviously a quite unusual proceeding in any\r\nsupposedly independent foreign country and the only defense of it\r\nwhich can be made is that it was the customary thing among all\r\nWesterners in the Ottoman Empire. Behind the Capitulations, Western\r\nschools, Western missionaries, Western traders and a number of less\r\ncreditable Westerners, alike found freedom to carry on their own\r\naffairs in their own way. The Capitulations provided Western\r\nimperialists with an opportunity which they were not likely to\r\noverlook and as long as imperialism flourished at Constantinople,\r\nAmerican schools and American missionaries enjoyed a security which\r\nwas well-nigh complete, however humiliating this state of things might\r\nhave been to the Ottoman Government. Even today there are American\r\neducators and American missionaries in Constantinople to whom the word\r\n“imperialism” means nothing, who say in the dazed manner of men who\r\nhave suddenly seen the very ground drop out from under their feet,\r\n“Imperialism has never bothered _us_….”\r\n\r\nWhile Christendom stood thus gazing into the Ottoman cockpit, the Old\r\nTurks were not idle. Abdul Hamid had lifted up the imperilled\r\nCaliphate in Constantinople so that all of Islam could see it. As far\r\nback as 1889, Pan-Islamism had sought to bring the _Shiah_ Moslems of\r\nPersia under the suzerainty of the _Sunni_ Caliph and this scheme\r\ninvolved considerations so far-reaching in their scope that it finally\r\nbrought about a project for a conference of all Islam at Mecca in\r\n1902. But Abdul Hamid had his own imperialism to consider, made\r\nnecessary though it was by the Eastern institution of the Caliphate,\r\nand his fear that his Arab populations would use the conference to air\r\ntheir secessionist program led him to quash the project. Pan-Islamism\r\ngave way to the new Pan-Turanian program under which Turkish and\r\nTartar Moslems were to shelve the Arabs who had given Islam to the\r\nworld, the Turkish tongue was to supplant Arabic as the sacred tongue\r\nof Islam, and all Arabic words were to be rooted out of the Turkish\r\nlanguage. This proved too large a morsel for conservative Islam to\r\nswallow, and Pan-Turanianism prospered no more than Pan-Islamism. It\r\ndid live, however, as a political project for welding the Tartar\r\npeoples against Orthodox Russia, for the Turkish ancestry runs deeply\r\ninto Central Asia.\r\n\r\nMuch of this Islamic maneuvring was the work of sophisticated Islamic\r\ncapitals. Old Turkish opinion itself continued to place its simple\r\nreliance in the institution of the Caliphate which had now become the\r\nrepository of the most venerable of Moslem usages. To the more\r\nthoughtful of the Old Turks, it was a matter of profound re-assurance\r\nthat the British Empire contained 100,000,000 Moslems to 80,000,000\r\nChristians, and that the Emperor of India in London was in friendly\r\ncontact with the Caliph. Those were the days when the _Sheikh-ul-Islam_\r\nin Constantinople was one of the last independent interpreters of\r\nMoslem law, and when the British Empire proudly called itself the\r\ngreatest Moslem Power in the world.\r\n\r\nBut King Edward’s first visit to Austria in 1903 disquieted Moslem\r\nopinion both in the Ottoman Empire and in India. The Emperor of India\r\nwas growing impatient. His further visits in 1905 and 1907 resulted in\r\na program of reforms in _gendarmerie_, finances, judiciary, public\r\nworks and the Army, which were to be imposed from without upon the\r\nrigidly conservative Empire. To the Young Turks who had been working\r\nfeverishly ever since the first visit to Austria in 1903, preparing to\r\nattempt the imposition of their really fundamental reforms from\r\nwithin, his program was only a step toward the final break-up of the\r\nEmpire. Already, instead of securely bridging the gap between East and\r\nWest the Empire creaked and cracked as though presently it would\r\ntumble into the widening chasm.\r\n\r\nLate in 1907, the Emperor of India’s patience ran out. In the spring\r\nof 1908, Edward VII touched a match to the carefully laid gun-powder\r\nof Young Turkish revolution which lit the Empire with the flare-up of\r\n1908. Ten years later, the blackened ruin of a once noble structure\r\ndisappeared from history and the gap between East and West yawned wide\r\nand empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [1] My authority for this statement is “Reconstruction in\r\n     Turkey,” a book published for private distribution in 1918\r\n     by the American Committee of Armenian and Syrian Relief, the\r\n     predecessor of the Near East Relief. “The estimate of their\r\n     (the Armenians’) number in the empire before the war,” says\r\n     Dr. Harvey Porter of Beirut College on page 15, “ranges from\r\n     1,500,000 to 2,000,000, but they were not in a majority in\r\n     any _vilayet_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE RUSSIAN MENACE\r\n\r\nHOW RUSSIA AND GREAT BRITAIN FOUGHT ACROSS THE OLD OTTOMAN EMPIRE――HOW\r\nRUSSIA ENTERED TRANS-CAUCASIA AND CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE\r\nARMENIANS――HOW IT APPROACHED THE BACK OF BRITISH INDIA THROUGH CENTRAL\r\nASIA――HOW GREAT BRITAIN FINALLY SURRENDERED IN THE ANGLO-RUSSIAN\r\nTREATY OF 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Russia was a great Eastern absolutism which had looked upon the\r\nmodern West and faithfully copied the methods of its imperialism.\r\nThese it utilized in its search for a secure outlet to the sea. It had\r\nreached the sea at Archangel on the Arctic, but Archangel is blocked\r\nby ice for nine months of the year. It had reached the sea along the\r\nBaltic shores, but its Baltic ports were as landlocked as the Lake\r\nports in the United States. The Baltic was commanded by Germany and\r\nGermany in turn was commanded by Great Britain. It had touched salt\r\nwater along the Black Sea, but its Black Sea ports were commanded by\r\nthe Ottoman Empire astride the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nIt was unable to rectify its position in the Baltic without\r\nprecipitating a European war and European wars are not only expensive\r\nbut to Eastern Powers like Russia are sometimes disastrous. It spent\r\nthe better part of a century in trying to solve its Black Sea problem\r\nby hewing back the Ottoman Empire and attempting to fasten its control\r\nover the Ottoman Sultan at Constantinople. But the Straits had already\r\nbecome the most vulnerable spot in the armor of the British Indian sea\r\nlines and the Ottoman Sultan was accordingly backed by all the\r\ninfluence which the great British Embassy in Constantinople could\r\nexert.\r\n\r\nThus when Russia compelled the Sultan to pay its price for stopping\r\nMohammed Ali’s drive up the Syrian corridor from Egypt in 1832, Great\r\nBritain did not hesitate to quash Russia’s treaty with the Sultan. And\r\nwhen the issues which the quashing of that treaty had left unsettled,\r\nwere revived twenty years later, Great Britain did not hesitate to\r\nenter the Crimean War to hold Russia back from any further approach to\r\nthe Straits. And when twenty years still later, the Mother Slav State,\r\nfollowing the lead of the South Slavs of Serbia, declared war on the\r\nSultan and smashed its way into San Stefano in the very suburbs of\r\nConstantinople, the British Navy did not hesitate to steam boldly up\r\nthe Straits and anchor off the Ottoman capital. For if the Russian\r\nArmy had been permitted to occupy it, the British sea lines from India\r\nmight easily have been thrown back to the long Cape route and another\r\nTrafalgar necessitated in order to settle again the question of the\r\ncommand of the Mediterranean, a question which the British Navy did\r\nnot propose to re-open.\r\n\r\nSo we reach that titanic struggle between two outside imperialisms\r\nwhich kept the Ottoman Empire tied hand and foot but still alive.\r\nAgainst Russia, Great Britain made common cause with the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. The Emperor of India and the Caliph of Islam stood together.\r\nIt is our misfortune that the Church of England was not able to avail\r\nitself of the position which its Defender then occupied, to discover\r\nwhat common ground existed on which the two great monotheistic faiths\r\nof Christianity and Islam might co-operate. Success in such a task\r\nwould have placed all of us, Christians and Moslems alike, heavily in\r\nits debt. But Englishmen to this day have never discovered the full\r\nbreadth and depth of the meaning of British India.\r\n\r\nDespite the Russian naval base of Sebastopol, Great Britain not only\r\nkept the Sultan in command of the Straits but even kept the Black Sea\r\nneutral. East of the Black Sea, however, the British writ did not run.\r\nHere between the Black Sea and the Caspian is the ancient barrier of\r\nthe Caucasus Range, below which the Trans-Caucasian plateau forms a\r\nbridge both to the back of the Ottoman Empire and to Persia. Below the\r\nblue peaks of the Caucasus Range lay Tiflis, the capital of the\r\nGeorgian Kingdom midway between the Black Sea and the Caspian, with\r\nthe Turkish village of Batum on the Black Sea shores and the Tartar\r\nvillage of Baku on the Caspian. Turks and Tartars were both Moslem,\r\nbut the old Georgian Kingdom was Orthodox and, extending in a broad\r\nbelt down through the Ottoman provinces in eastern Asia Minor were\r\nmost of the Armenians.\r\n\r\nExpanding Russia was not long in bursting the barrier of the Caucasus\r\nRange. More than a century ago, it swallowed the Georgian Kingdom,\r\nsnuffed out the eight little Tartar chieftains around Baku and found\r\nitself in contact with the Armenian _Catholicos_ and the eastern\r\nfringes of the _Ermeni_ community in the Ottoman Empire. In further\r\naccord with its policy of undermining that Empire, it availed itself\r\nof the presence of the Armenians in the usual imperialist manner and,\r\nin its war of 1876 against the Sultan, it drove its way deeply into\r\nhis eastern provinces, transferring the Armenians from Ottoman to\r\nRussian sovereignty as it went. Its objective was the great bay of\r\nAlexandretta on the Mediterranean which was to free it of its Black\r\nSea jail, a scheme which Great Britain recognized by secretly taking\r\nover the “administration” of Cyprus from the Sultan. The treaty of San\r\nStefano stopped the Russian advance hundreds of miles short of\r\nAlexandretta and in front of the new Ottoman frontier, Russia\r\ndeveloped Kars into a great fortress as a base for its further advance\r\ntoward Alexandretta when opportunity offered.\r\n\r\nHaving seized Batum from the Sultan, Russia continued the\r\nconsolidation of Trans-Caucasia under its own provincial governors and\r\nstamped the entire region with the unmistakable imprint of a Russian\r\neconomic _regime_. It pierced the barrier of the Caucasus Range with a\r\nmilitary highroad to Tiflis, which it prolonged as a railroad to Kars\r\nand the Armenian center of Erivan. It drove its railways past the east\r\nend of the Caucasus Range to make a Russian railhead and a Russian\r\nCaspian port of Baku, around which lay one of the greatest oil-fields\r\nin the world. It developed the village of Batum into a fortified\r\nRussian port on the Black Sea and with its Trans-Caucasian railroads\r\nfrom Batum _via_ Tiflis to Baku, it made Batum the gate to the Caspian\r\nfor all the Western world. Long before, it had driven the Persians\r\nfrom the Caspian, making a Russian lake of that inland sea, and\r\nRussian steamship lines from Baku to Enzeli, the port of Teheran, now\r\nmade Batum the world’s gate to the Persian capital.\r\n\r\nFrom the Trans-Caucasian bridge, the Russian march toward the sea\r\nforked into two directions. The direction in which the Russian Armies\r\nof 1876 turned, was toward Alexandretta on the Mediterranean. The\r\nother direction was indicated later when a railroad was carried from\r\nKars to the Persian frontier, whence it was to be continued when\r\nrequisite to Tabriz and Teheran. This might have exposed the Persian\r\nGulf to Russia, but the Government of India had already made the Gulf\r\nmore British than the Mediterranean. The Gulf had become a land-locked\r\nBritish lake whose narrow door-way into the Indian Ocean was dominated\r\nby the potential British naval base of Bunder Abbas. If Russia had\r\nsucceeded in reaching the Gulf through Persia, a Russian port on its\r\nshores would have been imprisoned by Bunder Abbas, as the Russian\r\nBlack Sea ports were already imprisoned by Constantinople and the\r\nRussian Baltic ports by the Sound. For the time being, the Russian\r\nTrans-Caucasian railhead on the north-west frontier of Persia awaited\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nEast of the Caspian, however, a century of Russian advances down\r\nacross the Moslem populations of Central Asia had brought the Russian\r\nfrontiers all the way down to Persia and Afghanistan. Russian rule\r\nthroughout this vast area had been as thoroughly consolidated under\r\nRussian provincial governments as had the Trans-Caucasian bridge. In\r\ntime, a line of railway was driven from St. Petersburg _via_ Moscow\r\nand Orenburg to Tashkent at the back of Afghanistan, whence it linked\r\nwith the Trans-Caspian Railway from Krasnovodsk, opposite Baku on the\r\nCaspian. Direct communication was thus afforded from St. Petersburg\r\nand from the Trans-Caucasian country to Persia and Afghanistan. With a\r\nRussian resident ruling in the ancient Moslem capital of Bokhara, a\r\nspur had been dropped from the Trans-Caspian line at Bokhara City to\r\nTermez on the northern frontier of Afghanistan whence a caravan road\r\nthreads its way up into the passes of the Hindu Kush and down again to\r\nKabul and the Khyber Pass. From the Merv oasis, also on the\r\nTrans-Caspian line, another spur had been dropped to Kushklinsky Post\r\non the Afghan frontier whence the traditional Herat-Kandahar-Kabul\r\nroad leads to the Khyber Pass and the fat plains of India.\r\n\r\nThis long loop of line from St. Petersburg and the Caspian to the back\r\nof Afghanistan traversed territory securely held by Russian arms and\r\nthe British had no contact with it, except the frontal contact of\r\ntheir railheads on the southern frontier of Afghanistan, _i. e._,\r\nwithin India itself. Except for diplomatic exchanges between London\r\nand St. Petersburg, the Government of India had no means of making\r\nitself felt at Bokhara City and the Merv oasis. Indeed, Russia had\r\nmade even the Afghan capital of Kabul an intermittent nightmare in\r\nIndia. Long ago, Russian intrigue in the Afghan capital had compelled\r\nthe East India Company in 1839 to dispatch an expeditionary force to\r\noccupy Kabul and unseat its Amir, an expeditionary force which found\r\nAfghanistan so hostile that it was wiped out of existence in such a\r\ndisaster as British India has never known before or since. Again in\r\n1879, Russian resentment over the Congress of Berlin led to the\r\ndispatch of a Russian mission to Kabul and when a British mission was\r\nturned back at the frontier, the Government of India sent a second\r\nexpeditionary force to set up a new Amir at Kabul. Intrigue at Kabul\r\nbecame Russia’s favorite reply to any strain in Anglo-Russian\r\nrelations, but it was not in Afghanistan that the real weight of\r\nRussian expansion finally made itself felt. Its construction of the\r\nTrans-Caspian railway had given it a base at Askabad on Persia’s\r\nnorth-east frontier, for an advance down across Persia to the Indian\r\nOcean outside Bunder Abbas. Here was a project which at one stroke\r\nwould not only free Russia of its inner Black Sea jail and its outer\r\nMediterranean jail, but would enable it to create a second Vladivostok\r\non the Indian Ocean which would take the British Indian sea lines in\r\nthe flank and cut the Indian peninsula bodily out of the British\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nRussia now projected a railway from Askabad to the Persian provincial\r\ncapital of Meshed and thence south past the Seistan, reaching the\r\nIndian Ocean presumably at Chahbar or Gwatter Bay. Having filled the\r\nPersian capital of Teheran with Russian intrigue and having thoroughly\r\nRussianized Meshed, Russia now began to close the Seistan gateway\r\nthrough which the great British Indian fortress of Quetta flanked the\r\nroute of its projected railway. Belgian customs officials in the\r\nemploy of the Russianized Persian Government, Russian “scientific”\r\nmissions and a strange “plague cordon” began mysteriously to break up\r\nthe caravans which were moving into and out of the Seistan.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Government of India had drawn the western\r\nfrontier of its Baluchistan province to include Gwatter Bay and had\r\nmade a British railhead of Chahbar. Further than this, it was\r\ndifficult to go effectively. There was no subject population in the\r\nsouth of Persia to subvert from its rulers in the north, as was the\r\ncase with the Arabs in the adjacent Ottoman Empire. Nor could the\r\ngreat British Legation at Teheran bolster up the weak Persian\r\nGovernment as a buffer against Russia, for the Persian capital lay far\r\naway to the north in the very shadow of Russia. Ever since that day a\r\ncentury ago when Russia burst the barrier of the Caucasus Range, a day\r\nwhose dire meaning for India was only beginning to be realized,\r\nTeheran had been exposed to Russia. It lay now only 200 miles from\r\nEnzeli on the Russianized Caspian and some 1,600 miles from Quetta\r\ninside the Seistan, a caravan route so arduous as to be out of the\r\nquestion. The Government of India’s only road to Teheran was the\r\n800-mile highroad _via_ Bagdad from Basra at the head of the Persian\r\nGulf.\r\n\r\nThe situation was a perilous one, however. The Cairo-Calcutta line of\r\nthe great British Cape-to-Cairo-to-Calcutta scheme would be cut in\r\nPersia by Russia’s projected route from Askabad to the Indian Ocean.\r\nThe Government of India had envisaged a line extending from\r\nConstantinople to Kabul as an outworks in front of its Cairo-Calcutta\r\nline. That Constantinople-Kabul line was the common interest of the\r\nOttoman Caliph and the Emperor of India, but its conception was\r\nhopelessly tardy. It had been broken a century ago when the East India\r\nCompany was fretting about France, and Russia was bursting the barrier\r\nof the Caucasus Range to occupy the Trans-Caucasian bridge; for in any\r\nConstantinople-Kabul line, the Caucasus Range is a frontier as\r\nindispensable to the Government of India as the Hindu Kush itself.\r\n\r\nEven at Constantinople, the accustomed rule of the British Embassy had\r\nbeen supplanted by the rising influence of the German Embassy. A\r\nformidable new German enemy was already moving in force along the\r\nroads to British India. Great Britian was losing ground both in\r\nConstantinople and in Persia, which had now become the most vulnerable\r\nspots in its very vulnerable Indian Empire. The Czar was on his way to\r\nbecome the ruler of the world, and the British Government surrendered.\r\nAt the price of a heavy retreat in Persia, it purchased a truce with\r\nits Russian enemy and faced about to meet its new German enemy.\r\n\r\nThat truce with Russia was the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907 which\r\nenabled King Edward to meet the Czar at Reval in 1908 to conclude the\r\nAnglo-Russian _entente_ against Germany. Under the terms of this\r\nhistoric Treaty, Russia abandoned Afghanistan to the Government of\r\nIndia, and Persia was divided into three “zones of influence,” the\r\nnorthern half of the country to Russia, most of the arid southern half\r\na neutral zone, and a small triangle in south-east Persia to the\r\nGovernment of India, a triangle which was drawn to include all of\r\nPersia’s open seaboard from Bunder Abbas to Baluchistan, including\r\nChahbar, Gwatter Bay and any other potential ports which Russian\r\nsurveyors might have staked out. This division of the country was\r\naccompanied by mutual Russian and British engagements “to respect the\r\nintegrity and independence of Persia,” a clause which gives us quite\r\nthe correct imperialist touch.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the two signatories in drawing this historic Treaty was\r\n“to settle by mutual agreement different questions concerning the\r\ninterests of their States on the Continent of Asia,” and this they did\r\nwith conspicuous success. They began by breaking Persia. They\r\ncontinued by breaking the Ottoman Empire and the Caliphate of Islam.\r\nThey have finished by breaking Christendom.\r\n\r\nPossibly in the new humility and the broader tolerance in which\r\nChristendom will one day emerge from its present collapse, we shall\r\nall be the better for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG TURKISH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n“ON THE MORNING OF JULY 23, 1908”――THE OLD TURKISH COUNTER-REVOLUTION\r\nAND ITS DEFEAT――HOW ISLAM AND THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES NULLIFIED THE\r\nYOUNG TURKISH PROGRAM――KEMAL’S BREAK WITH ENVER AND HIS RETIREMENT\r\nFROM POLITICS――THE BALKAN WARS AND NATIONALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree months after King Edward’s visit to Reval in the spring of 1908,\r\nthe frightened Young Turks launched their revolution with Niazi Bey’s\r\nmutiny at Resna, fifteen miles from Monastir. On the morning of July\r\n23, 1908, the house walls of Monastir were placarded with mottoes in\r\nTurkish――“Death or Liberty,” “The Nation and Liberty,” “Freedom and\r\nthe Constitution.” Enver Bey proclaimed the Constitution at Salonica.\r\nTelegrams from Salonica invited the Sultan to choose between the\r\nConstitution and war. The officers of his Army were Young Turks to a\r\nman. Even the reliable Anatolian regiments refused to march against\r\nthe rebels. Abdul Hamid surrendered. Parliamentary government with\r\nfree and equal suffrage for all the races of the Empire, was\r\nproclaimed from the Throne. Abdul’s exiles came trooping home to find\r\nMoslem _hojas_ and Orthodox clergy embracing each other and shouting\r\nfor the _Padishah_. The magic of that Western word “Constitution”\r\nblended all the Empire in a transport of joy. The Young Turks were\r\nswept into the Government on a wave of rejoicing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD MARSHAL FEVZI PASHA\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and Chief of the General Staff, First Grand National\r\nAssembly; Chief of the General Staff, Second Grand National Assembly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALI FETHY BEY\r\n\r\nNationalist Deputy in the Ottoman Chamber until his arrest and\r\ndeportation to Malta on March 16, 1920; Minister of the Interior of\r\nthe First Grand National Assembly after his return from Malta in\r\nNovember, 1921; Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior of the\r\nSecond Grand National Assembly.]\r\n\r\nBut the Caliph and the Emperor of India had parted company. Attempts\r\nto interest the British Government in the possibilities of Young\r\nTurkish achievement definitely failed. The fate of the Ottoman Empire\r\nhad been settled far outside its own frontiers. Before an\r\nAnglo-Russian _entente_, its end was only a matter of time. Already\r\nthe name of Constantine had been introduced into the Russian Imperial\r\nFamily. With the Defender of the Faith and the Caliph now posed in\r\nopposition, the way was opened at last for the Church of England to\r\nopen theological disquisitions at the Orthodox Patriarchate of Moscow,\r\nwhich looked toward the setting up of the joint capital of the two\r\ncommunions in Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe Young Turks had won over the Army with ease, but they had not won\r\nover the silent mass of conservative Old Turkish opinion in which lay\r\nthe real strength of Abdul Hamid. Four months after their new\r\nParliament had assembled under the revived Constitution, the Old Turks\r\nsuppressed it and Constantinople troops scattered the deputies with\r\nshouts of “_Sheriat!_” (Moslem law). Mahmoud Shevket Pasha, with the\r\nyoung Kemal as his Chief of Staff, immediately marched on\r\nConstantinople with the Third Army from Salonica, and in less than a\r\nweek the Parliament was restored. Four of its deputies――two Turks, a\r\nChristian and a Jew――presented themselves before Abdul Hamid with the\r\ndemand of the Young Turks for his abdication. The last of the\r\nout-and-out Easterners left Yildiz Kiosk to spend the remainder of his\r\ndays in a Salonica dungeon, and Mohammed V succeeded him with the\r\nYoung Turkish Parliament as the seat of authority in his Government.\r\nAnd the seat of authority in the Young Turkish Parliament was the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress, which ruled the capital from its\r\nheadquarters at Salonica.\r\n\r\nOttomanization had won and held its opportunity by force, but in the\r\napplication of its Westernism to a large Eastern community of Moslems\r\nand smaller Eastern communities of Christians, it met with instant\r\ndifficulties. If Moslems and non-Moslems were to be made equals in an\r\nOttoman citizenry, it was necessary that both should give up their\r\ndividing community institutions and assume instead equal duties and\r\nequal rights under the Parliament. This only shocked the Old Turks and\r\nas for the Christians, the suggestion only made them cling the more\r\ntightly to their community institutions. The application of\r\nOttomanization only drove them into nationalism. Westernism was as\r\nunpalatable to the _Rûm_ and _Ermeni_ communities as to the dominant\r\nIslamic community. The Empire was locked in the dead grip of ancient\r\nreligious usage. Moslems and Christians alike were gripped by the dead\r\nfingers of the past. Even if the Empire had had a longer span of life\r\nahead of it than it did have, it is quite possible that nothing but\r\nforce would have pried away those dead fingers and released the\r\nvigorous life they contained. But if force was to be used, the Old\r\nTurks would have used it to prevent any violation of the usages of the\r\nfaith they loved and served, and Greeks and Armenians would have used\r\nit to pull down an ancient Moslem theocracy and set up in its place\r\ntheir own Christian theocracies.\r\n\r\nVery well, said the Young Turks, give us a generation of universal\r\neducation and we will create our Ottoman Nation; in the meantime, we\r\nYoung Turks will hold the Empire together. And so they proceeded, the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress at Salonica maintaining its iron\r\ncontrol of the rigidly centralized Government at Constantinople and\r\nthe revolution degenerating for the time being into a mere _coup\r\nd’etat_. As for Kemal, he recoiled in bitter disillusionment from the\r\nfiasco into whose preparation he had thrown all his young energies. He\r\nbroke with Enver in a sharp quarrel at the 1910 congress of the\r\nCommittee of Union and Progress at Salonica, and devoted himself to\r\nreforms in the Army until Enver exiled him to Tripoli. Izzet Pasha\r\nshortly brought him back to Salonica, Mahmoud Shevket took him to\r\nAlbania, and when the war with Italy began, Enver sent him back to\r\nTripoli to command native irregulars. During the First Balkan War, he\r\nwas permitted to twiddle his thumbs on the Dardanelles but he\r\nparticipated in the recapture of Adrianople in the Second Balkan War.\r\nThereafter he was dispatched to Sofia as military _attache_ where he\r\njoined Ali Fethy Bey, another Staff officer and a former acquaintance\r\nat the War Academy in Constantinople, who was then Minister to\r\nBulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe Italian War and the two Balkan Wars were natural sequels to the\r\nAnglo-Russian Treaty of 1907. Far outside the frontiers of the Empire,\r\nits final break-up had been decreed, and the conference at Bucharest\r\nwhich ended the Second Balkan War was a diplomatic maneuvring for\r\nposition between Russia and Austria-Hungary. The latter won and Serbia\r\nwas wrapped round with a hostile Albania, a hostile Bulgaria and a\r\nhostile Greece. The only other interest which the Balkan Wars hold for\r\nus, lies in the fact that they left a Constantine, wedded to a Sophia,\r\npreparing at Athens for still another war.\r\n\r\nFive centuries ago, the Catholics of Spain had driven the Moors out of\r\nEurope and destroyed the great Moslem monuments at Cordoba, Grenada\r\nand Toledo. The Orthodox of Old Greece were now planning to visit the\r\nsame fate on the Turks and to restore a Byzantine Christian theocracy\r\nin Constantinople. The Young Turks’ attempt at Ottomanization had made\r\ntheir _Rûm_ community more than ever tenacious of its institutions,\r\nand it had come to a time when the Ottoman Greeks in the capital were\r\nready to join with Athens and the Phanar in lifting the Cross over the\r\nyellow-brown dome of the great mosque of _Ayiah Sophia_ in Stamboul.\r\n\r\nAn ugly and a mediaeval business, but a business in which the Greeks\r\nwere by no means alone. Its irony lay in the Anglo-Russian Treaty of\r\n1907. The Church of England had followed its Foreign Office into\r\ncontact with _Russian_ Orthodoxy and it was only a matter of time\r\nuntil the Foreign Office should acquiesce in the _Russian_ claim to\r\nthe steep green shores of the Bosphorus and the honey-colored coasts\r\nof the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nThe shock of defeat in the Balkan Wars turned the Young Turks in the\r\ndirection of nationalism. Their subject races had never been\r\namalgamated, and now that Greeks, Armenians and even Arabs were\r\ndeveloping racial consciousnesses of their own, efforts at\r\namalgamation were hopelessly tardy. Ottomanization had swiftly broken\r\ndown into Turkification which became a bitter business of force and\r\nonly drove the races of the Empire farther apart. But the only\r\nalternative to Turkification was the abandonment of the Empire and\r\nwith it the Caliphate of Islam. Still borne down by the heavy\r\nresponsibilities whose faithful discharge Islam expected of them, the\r\nOld Turks clung tenaciously to the Caliphate but the Young Turks,\r\nwhile refraining from a break with Islam, moved increasingly out of\r\nthe grip of old religious usage toward a new Western nationalism.\r\n\r\nThere was much that was fine in their crude nationalism. It prized its\r\nown Turkish culture. It attempted to purge its language of its\r\nborrowed Persian and Arabic vocabulary. It sought to open up the\r\nresources of Western literatures by copious translations into Turkish.\r\nIt even translated the Koran although in so doing it ran close to an\r\nopen break with Islam, which counts it a sin to print the Koran in any\r\nlanguage but the sacred language of Arabic. It broke down the barriers\r\nwhich fence off the enormous religious endowments of Islam, and the\r\nMinistry of _Evkaf_ supplied funds to start a national library and to\r\nsubsidize a national architecture. It started schools and began\r\nreforms in the Moslem seminaries, which were Old Turkish strongholds.\r\nIt began a widespread physical culture after the type of the Slavic\r\n_Sokols_ and the Boy Scouts. It found voice in the impassioned cry of\r\nthe Turkish poet, Mehmed Emin Bey, “_I am a Turk, my race and language\r\nare great._” It looked forward to the day when the humiliating\r\nCapitulations should be abolished and the Turks should take their\r\nplace as an equal among equals in the family of nations. But it still\r\nhad to accommodate its fine youth to the old conservatism of Islam,\r\nthe Empire still obscured and confused it.\r\n\r\nThe two Balkan Wars had reduced the Empire to a condition which in the\r\nWest would have been regarded as the end of all things. It was on the\r\nverge of bankruptcy, but the Capitulations still prevented it from\r\nincreasing its sources of revenue. Rauf Bey’s exploits with the raider\r\n_Hamidieh_ during the Balkan Wars had stimulated its pride in its Navy\r\nand Constantine’s preparations at Athens for another war, this time\r\nagainst Constantinople itself, had shown the immediate need for a\r\nlarger Navy, but so low had it fallen that money had to be raised by\r\nprivate subscription before an order could be placed with British\r\nyards for two new battleships.\r\n\r\nYet the existence of the Empire still preserved a sort of surface\r\npeace among its races. They had become drunken on Westernism and they\r\nwaited only the day of the Empire’s break-up to begin the process of\r\ntheir disentanglement, a process which in any area between Vienna and\r\nBagdad is not a pretty one to contemplate. The Old Greeks were\r\npreparing their march to the relief of the “unredeemed” Greeks of\r\nConstantinople. The Young Turks were preparing their own march to the\r\n“unredeemed” Turks of the Azerbaijan province in Persia, of Russian\r\nTrans-Caucasia and the Russian provinces of Central Asia.\r\n\r\nThe moment was at hand when the Anglo-Russian mill-stone was to close\r\nupon the Empire and grind it to pieces, when the broken pieces of it\r\nwere to be whelmed beneath a very deluge of disentanglement. Meanwhile\r\nthe Committee of Union and Progress still ruled in Constantinople,\r\nwith its local committees in every province. There was an Opposition,\r\nthe old Union and Liberty faction, better known as the Liberal\r\n_Entente_ Party, but it had a poor time of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nGERMANY AND THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\nBRITISH POLICY AT CONSTANTINOPLE――THE BAGDAD RAILWAY CONCESSIONS――\r\nRUSSIA’S VETO AND THE CHANGE OF ROUTE――THE ACHILLES’ HEEL OF\r\nALEPPO――GERMANY AND ISLAM――THE BRITISH INDIAN FRONTIER IN SERBIA――THE\r\nGREAT WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must make it plain that we are not here concerned with any aspect of\r\nGermany west of the Balkans. The scene of this narrative lies east of\r\nthe Balkans and, insofar as it is possible to do so, we shall restrict\r\nit to its proper _locale_. Although there was no German tradition in\r\nConstantinople comparable to its British and French traditions,\r\nGermany’s highway to the East crossed at the Straits the favorite\r\nRussian route to the Mediterranean and hence afforded to the Ottoman\r\nGovernment the same protection from its Russian enemy as the British\r\nhad once afforded. Nor was the German attraction solely diplomatic.\r\nThe Bagdad railway scheme afforded the Empire an opportunity for that\r\ninternal economic development which the Capitulations had made it\r\nimpossible for the Government itself to finance.\r\n\r\nThe British had not only supported the Government in Constantinople in\r\norder to bar Russia from the Straits, but incidentally in order to bar\r\nwestern Europe from the ancient land lines which make Constantinople a\r\npotential gate to India. We in are West who are accustomed to lives of\r\npeace, sometimes forget that war is usually a business of attacking\r\nand defending the sources and the routes of trade, and that\r\nimperialism concerns itself with the security of the trade sources and\r\nthe trade routes. If we did not live in a world of enemies, matters\r\nmight be quite different, for from any standpoint of abstract\r\neconomics, where trade is able to flow both by land and sea, it is\r\nusually desirable that it should. The sea lines are only the slow\r\nfreight lines and the land lines the fast mail and passenger lines.\r\nBut to the imperialist, the first requisite of any important trade\r\nroute is its security against attack by any possible enemy, and where\r\nnative Governments are kept in a tied condition, it is the\r\nimperialists who mark out the long distance trade routes. The British\r\nNavy made the sea lines secure but, short of becoming a land Power as\r\nwell as a sea Power, no means existed by which the British could\r\ncontrol any land line from Constantinople toward India, to say nothing\r\nof rendering it secure against attack by any possible enemy.\r\nAccordingly, Great Britain spared no effort at Constantinople to\r\nconfine western Europe’s communication with India to the sea lines\r\nwhich converge into the Suez Canal, although incidentally the Ottoman\r\nEmpire was thus long denied the through railway it sorely needed and\r\nwestern Europe was permitted to content itself with slow freight\r\nfacilities to India.\r\n\r\nBut with the passing of British influence from Constantinople, the\r\nland lines toward India were at last uncovered. In 1888, the Ottoman\r\nGovernment transferred to a syndicate formed by the _Deutsche Bank_ of\r\nBerlin a 56-mile railway from Haidar Pasha, a suburb of Constantinople,\r\nto Ismid on the Sea of Marmora, and accompanied the transfer with a\r\nconcession to extend the line some 300 miles due east _via_ Eski-Shehr\r\nto Angora. In the acceptance of this transfer and the exploitation of\r\nthe concession which accompanied it, Germany began to free itself of\r\nthe Suez Canal.\r\n\r\nThis concession was utilized by a German group calling itself the\r\nOttoman Anatolia Railway Company, which soon received a further\r\nconcession for the construction of a 230-mile extension of the Angora\r\nline to Caesarea. The new concession contemplated still further\r\nconcessions through Sivas and Diarbekr to Mosul and thence down the\r\nTigris to Bagdad, a route which would have cut Russia’s projected\r\nroute from Kars to Alexandretta. Russia promptly vetoed it and the\r\nCaesarea concession was dropped. A second concession had been received\r\nat the same time, however, for a 269-mile line from Eski-Shehr on the\r\nIsmid-Angora line to Konia, and Russia’s veto now changed the Konia\r\nline from a feeder line to the main Bagdad line. The necessary\r\nconcessions for its extension from Konia through the Taurus Mountains\r\nand on to Bagdad and Basra at the head of the Persian Gulf were\r\ngranted in 1903 to the Imperial Bagdad Ottoman Railway Company, which\r\ntook over the franchises of the original Ottoman Anatolia Company.\r\n\r\nWith railways and railway concessions in its possession for a\r\n1,800-mile line from Haidar Pasha to Basra, the Bagdad Railway Company\r\nnow compared in its high political significance with the late East\r\nIndia Company or the Suez Canal Company or the Anglo-Persian Oil\r\nCompany. The Berlin-to-Bagdad scheme of which it was part, isolated\r\nRussia from the Mediterranean by cutting its projected land line\r\nthrough Serbia to the Adriatic, its projected sea line through the\r\nStraits and its projected land line from Kars to Alexandretta.\r\nPolitically, it had even a wider meaning. In 1898, the Kaiser visited\r\nConstantinople in person and, after receiving the highest honors which\r\nthe Ottoman Sultan could confer upon him, continued his tour down the\r\nSyrian corridor to Damascus and Jerusalem, proclaiming himself the\r\nfriend of Islam. Some years later, this move acquired significance to\r\nthat body of Islamic peoples who live between Constantinople and Kabul\r\nand who found themselves locked in the vise-like grip of the\r\nAnglo-Russian Treaty of 1907.\r\n\r\nThe precise route of the Bagdad Railway was a matter not easily settled.\r\nRussia had driven it south from its original Caesarea-Sivas-Diarbekr\r\nroute and Great Britain now tried to pull it still further south,\r\nall the way down to the beach back of Alexandretta Bay where\r\nthe British Navy could cut it when requisite without more trouble than\r\nthat of sending off a landing party. The beach route was avoided,\r\nhowever, even though its avoidance necessitated heavy tunnelling to\r\nbreach the Taurus, but the British menace at Alexandretta was never\r\nwholly escaped. For Aleppo through which its route was finally fixed,\r\nwas only a two days’ march from Alexandretta which in turn was only a\r\nhalf-day’s steaming from Cyprus, which the British had taken secretly\r\nfrom the Sultan in 1876. Aleppo became the most vulnerable spot in the\r\nBerlin-to-Bagdad scheme, protected in case of war only by the fact\r\nthat prior Russian and French claims upon it might tie the British\r\nhands. Here the Bagdad Railway was to effect a junction with the\r\nFrench railways which drop down the Syrian corridor to Damascus, and\r\nthe Caliph’s inland Hejaz Railway dropped from Damascus down the back\r\nof the Syrian corridor to Medina whence it overlooked Mecca. Had the\r\nBritish been free in case of war to occupy Aleppo from Cyprus, the\r\nBerlin-to-Bagdad scheme would not only have been cut, but the Ottoman\r\nEmpire would have fallen at once into two parts and ultimately into\r\nthree. Deprived of the use of the sea, Constantinople would have been\r\ncut off from Syria and the Hejaz immediately and its communication\r\nwith Mesopotamia would have been driven north into the heart of Asia\r\nMinor where the inevitable Russian advance from Trans-Caucasia would\r\nhave imperilled it. Aleppo became the Achilles’ heel of the Empire,\r\npointed out to all who know their maps by the tell-tale finger of\r\nCyprus.\r\n\r\nWhen finally adopted, the route of the Bagdad Railway began at Konia\r\non the Anatolian plateau, 3,300 feet above sea level, and well back\r\ninto the hinterland approached the Taurus whose peaks rear their\r\nsnow-clad summits against the sky at an altitude of 12,000 feet. Once\r\nthrough the Taurus, its route descended to the low plain of Cilicia\r\nand rose again to surmount the 5,000-foot Amanus Range which rims off\r\nthe top of the Syrian corridor. Thence it dropped to the 1,200-foot\r\nlevel of Aleppo at the top of Syria. The rest of the way to Bagdad was\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nWork on it began at once and continued until the Ottoman Government\r\nsigned its Mudros armistice in October, 1918. By that time, its\r\nisolated sections had been linked in a continuous line from Haidar\r\nPasha to Nisibin on the flatlands of Upper Mesopotamia, a distance of\r\n1,100 miles. Here seems to have been the beginning of a land line to\r\nIndia, a line which might now be carrying fast mail and passenger\r\ntraffic not only toward India but toward South Africa as well. The\r\nIndian traffic might some day be continued from Bagdad across the\r\nPersian plateau and into the Seistan to link with the Nushki Railway\r\nfrom Quetta, or alternatively from Basra along the Persian seaboard to\r\nthe Indian railhead of Chahbar. Similarly, the South African traffic\r\nwould be diverted at Aleppo down the Syrian corridor to Cairo and on\r\nto Khartoum in the Sudan, to be continued some day over whatever\r\nrail-and-ferry route is finally chosen for the Cape-to-Cairo system.\r\nIt is by no means to be assumed that the Bagdad Railway would have\r\nproved itself a sound commercial proposition or that the world is in\r\nimmediate need of those land lines to India and South Africa of which\r\nit would have formed a part. Its route was not dictated by the\r\neconomic needs of the Ottoman Empire, although it did incidentally\r\nafford that Empire the promise of a trunk line from Constantinople to\r\nBagdad of which it stood in sore need. Some day when native\r\nGovernments have won for themselves the right to mark out their own\r\nrailway routes, projects like the Bagdad Railway may correspond more\r\nclosely to the economic needs of the countries through which they\r\npass, and international trains will presumably still be afforded us\r\nover long distance routes just as they are afforded us in Europe. But\r\nthe imperialists have other matters to think about beside the economic\r\nneeds of native Governments.\r\n\r\nHowever sound as an economic proposition the Bagdad Railway might\r\nultimately have shown itself to be, it did merit the most serious\r\nattention in the West as a possible step in the economic development\r\nof the East, and this is precisely what it did _not_ receive. Germany\r\nbacked it and Great Britain fought it, both of them for the same\r\nreason, namely, that it escaped the Suez Canal. The legitimate needs\r\nof the Ottoman Empire governed neither of them.\r\n\r\nAs at first proposed, the Bagdad Railway would have given Germany a\r\nfoothold from which to call in question almost at once British control\r\nof the Persian Gulf. Here Great Britain had recently tapped the\r\nsouthern end of that rich oil-belt which runs all the way down the\r\nwestern rim of Persia from Baku. In a day when the basis of industry\r\nwas shifting from coal to oil, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had\r\ntapped the Persian fields at Ahwaz and piped their flow 100 miles down\r\nto its refineries at Abadan near Basra, of which the Bagdad Railway\r\nnow proposed to make a German railhead. Negotiations between London\r\nand Berlin prompted the Bagdad Railway Company to drop its\r\nBagdad-Basra concession, but even if Bagdad were to become a German\r\nrailhead, it would have cut the Government of India’s only line of\r\ncommunication with Teheran and would have menaced at Basra the\r\nCairo-to-Calcutta line of its great Cape-to-Cairo-to-Calcutta scheme.\r\n\r\nThe Bagdad Railway, however, did not expose itself to British\r\ndiplomatic sabotage as France’s canal across the Egyptian isthmus had\r\nbeen exposed, for the British Embassy was no longer supreme at\r\nConstantinople. It was in Serbia that the German highway to the East\r\ncrossed the Russian line to the Adriatic, and Austria-Hungary was\r\nstill seeking a pretext to clear the remnant of the South Slavs from\r\nGermany’s path. In Serbia lay the frontier of British India. Over the\r\nSerbian criss-cross, Great Britain joined Russia in the Anglo-Russian\r\nTreaty of 1907, France joined the two of them after the Agadir crisis\r\nof 1911 in Morocco, and Europe was divided into two armed camps, a\r\ndivision which pivotted on Serbia.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Great Britain, Russia and France continued negotiations with\r\nGermany over the Bagdad Railway. In the Potsdam Agreement of 1911,\r\nRussia finally turned down the British scheme for a Trans-Persian line\r\nlinking the Russian Trans-Caucasian railways with the Nushki Railway\r\nfrom Quetta, and chose to link its Trans-Caucasian system with the\r\nBagdad Railway instead, undertaking to build feeder lines from the\r\nRussian zone in north Persia to the main Bagdad line in Mesopotamia.\r\nBy 1914, Great Britain had withdrawn its objection to the Bagdad\r\nRailway and had agreed to support no rival railway, exception being\r\nmade for a Cairo-Basra line along the Cairo-Calcutta leg of its\r\nCape-to-Cairo-to-Calcutta triangle. At the same time, negotiations\r\nwere nearing completion between France and Germany, but all these\r\nagreements lightly disappeared when the long-expected bugle call\r\nfinally sounded out of Serbia on June 28, 1914, and away to the north,\r\nthe east and the west, the drums began their answering roll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nCHRISTENDOM AND THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of the war of 1914-18 upon modern Christendom would not\r\nconcern us here if the scene of this narrative were not a Moslem\r\ncountry to which Christendom, beginning with Old Greece and running\r\nwest to the country towns of the United States, has adopted an\r\nattitude of superiority. I do not need to say that the subject of\r\nChristianity itself is very far removed from the realm of controversy,\r\nbut its communicants are human beings and are not only subjects of\r\nlegitimate controversy but of entirely healthy controversy.\r\n\r\nMoslems are usually hospitable to all foreigners and they frequently\r\nrespect missionaries personally. They use mission hospitals and\r\noccasionally they avail themselves of the advantages of foreign\r\nschools. But for missionaries as Christians, engaged in spreading a\r\ngospel of peace while their contemporaries at home invent poison gas,\r\nMoslems have neither understanding nor respect. In their Christian\r\ncapacities, missionaries are tolerated as long as they do not offend.\r\n\r\nThe older missionaries know these things. They know that in their\r\neffort to spread Christianity, their greatest enemies have been the\r\nChristians, and most of their work in the Ottoman Empire has been an\r\neffort to convert Eastern Christians to a Western interpretation of\r\nChristianity. But this their supporters in the United States have to\r\nthis day never realized. Americans at home have assumed that the word\r\n_Christian_ is an all-sufficing label, that the communicants of the\r\nOrthodox and Gregorian Churches in the East are Christians as Western\r\nProtestants understand the term, that Eastern Moslems are heathen in\r\nthe Western meaning of the word; and on this assumption they have\r\nbuilt up out of the mutual tragedies of racial and religious\r\ndisentanglement in the Ottoman Empire, their Christian martyr-legend\r\nand the sorry butcher-legend which they have attached to the Turks.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries’ supporters at home are firm believers in\r\nprohibition, but the missionaries themselves know that the liquor\r\ntraffic in the Ottoman Empire has been in the hands of native and\r\nWestern Christians, protected under the Capitulations by Christian\r\nGovernments. Yet so habitual has the Christian attitude of superiority\r\nbecome, that American churchmen have actually gone to Constantinople\r\nwithin these last four years and have come away unhumbled. The city of\r\nIslam has been under the Christians’ control for four years and the\r\nsight of it has been such a rebuke as Christendom has not suffered\r\nsince the great Moslem reformation first purged the decadent Eastern\r\nChristendom of the Middle Ages. Americans at home have not yet learned\r\nthat European Governments have sometimes accepted Christianity “in\r\nprinciple” rather than in fact, and that only when the Christians\r\nthemselves, from British Foreign Secretaries down to the humblest\r\nGreek dive-keepers in Galata, have been converted to the practice of\r\nChristianity, will the missionaries gain the understanding and respect\r\nof Islam.\r\n\r\nI am attempting to speak plainly upon a subject which can be no more\r\nthan suggested here for it carries us quickly outside the proper scope\r\nof this narrative, but it is necessary to touch upon it if our subject\r\nis to be plumbed to its depths. I believe that American Protestantism\r\nand British Nonconformism have their greatest task still ahead of them\r\nand that that task lies nearer home than Islam. I believe that task is\r\nnothing less than the salvage of the practice of Christianity from the\r\nwreck the Christians themselves have made of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE WAR AND ISLAM\r\n\r\nKEMAL HURRIES BACK TO CONSTANTINOPLE AND RAUF BEY ASKS THE BRITISH\r\nEMBASSY TO FINANCE NEUTRALITY――ENVER ENTERS THE WAR AND PERSIA\r\nATTEMPTS TO FOLLOW HIM――THE HARD POSITION OF ISLAM IN INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nKemal left his post as military _attache_ at Sofia immediately on the\r\noutbreak of war in Europe, and hurried back to Constantinople, still a\r\nyoung officer but an officer with a brilliant past, a hatred of the\r\nEnver Government which was both personal and political, and a prestige\r\nin the Army comparable to the prestige in the Navy which Hussein Rauf\r\nBey had won in the raider _Hamidie_. The probability that Russia would\r\nparticipate in the European war had afforded the Enver Ministry the\r\nopportunity it sought to achieve its Pan-Turanian project, to carry\r\nthe Crescent and Star to the “unredeemed” Turks of the Azerbaijan\r\nprovince of Persia, of Russian Trans-Caucasia and of the Russian\r\nprovinces in Central Asia. Fired by the same crude Westernism as had\r\nturned the eyes of the Old Greeks to the “unredeemed” Greeks of\r\nConstantinople, the Enver Ministry had envisaged a Greater Ottoman\r\nEmpire which, while maintaining the Caliphate out of deference to Old\r\nTurkish and Islamic opinion, would “liberate” 40,000,000 “Turks” then\r\n“groaning under the heel of the Russian oppressor” and would emerge\r\nfrom the war a Great Power extending from the Balkans to Bokhara. The\r\nArabs to the south would be hammered into that respect for the\r\nCaliphate which they had once manifested, but the Turks’ real future\r\nlay away to the east. So the Enver Ministry concluded its secret\r\nagreement with Germany, the British Government seized the two Ottoman\r\nbattleships which were building in British yards, and Germany was soon\r\nto run the Goeben and Breslau into the Straits to take their places.\r\n\r\nTo Kemal and Rauf, the latter of whom had brought his crew home from\r\none of the two seized battleships in England, Enver’s Pan-Turanianism\r\nwas a program which the Empire could not afford. Both of them were\r\nWesterners, but their Westernism was hard and practical and close to\r\nthe ground. Within the limits imposed upon them by the Caliphate,\r\nwhich made the Empire the leader of Islam, they held that the Turk’s\r\nfirst duty was to his own country. Russia having entered the war in\r\nEurope, a defense of the eastern frontier would be necessary but the\r\nEmpire’s internal condition made it essential that events in Europe\r\nshould not be permitted to carry it further than a state of armed\r\nneutrality. In the country’s bankrupt condition, the Enver Ministry\r\nhad secured the promise of German loans on condition that it\r\nparticipated in the war against Germany’s enemies, and Rauf went to\r\nthe British Embassy immediately on his return to Constantinople, to\r\nsay that payment by the British Government for the two battleships it\r\nhad seized would strengthen the hands of the Opposition by enabling it\r\nto finance mobilization on the eastern frontier without resort to\r\nGerman money.\r\n\r\nIn this, Rauf spoke not only for the political Opposition but for the\r\nstrong British and French traditions in Constantinople to which\r\nEnver’s course was a source of genuine grief. Rauf says, however, that\r\nthe British Embassy made him no reply. To quote his precise words:\r\n“England made every effort to get Honduras, Paraguay and Greece into\r\nthe war on the side of the Allies, but for us she had no word.” The\r\nEmperor of India and the Caliph had parted company in 1907. Great\r\nBritain remained true to its commitments to Russia. Enver’s\r\nPan-Turanianism may have been impractical or not, but to any Ottoman\r\nGovernment, whether headed by Enver or Rauf, there were only two\r\ncourses in the face of Russia――either to defend itself or to cease to\r\nexist. The Enver Government secured its loans from Germany on the only\r\nterms on which it could get them and if those terms involved war\r\nagainst Great Britain, it illy becomes British statesmen to complain.\r\nIt was not the Enver Government which drew up the Anglo-Russian Treaty\r\nof 1907.\r\n\r\nGerman naval officers hustled the Enver Government to a break by\r\nbombarding Odessa and dropping the mined nets which closed the\r\nStraits, thus banging and bolting the Black Sea gate to Russia as\r\ntheir own Navy in the north had already banged and bolted Russia’s\r\nBaltic gate. The Caliph proclaimed a Holy War against all Christians\r\nexcept Germans and Austrians, a proclamation which presumably was\r\nintended to wreck British India but which had the immediate effect of\r\nwrecking Tokatlian’s restaurant in Pera instead. The Enver Government\r\nabrogated the humiliating Capitulations and proclaimed its war aims:\r\n“Our participation in the world war represents the vindication of our\r\nnational ideal. The ideal of our nation and people leads us toward the\r\ndestruction of our Russian enemy, in order to obtain thereby a natural\r\nfrontier to our Empire, which should include and unite all branches of\r\nour race.” Enver himself took command on the eastern frontier and his\r\nmain body crossed into Russian Trans-Caucasia, while a smaller force\r\ncrossed the Persian frontier toward Tabriz. Ahead of him in both\r\ndirections lay large Turkish-speaking populations, and behind him in\r\nConstantinople the Opposition had been scattered. Rauf, the hero of\r\nthe _Hamidie_, was eventually exiled to a volunteer command in Persia,\r\na great seaman fighting with the infantry. Kemal was eventually sent\r\nto the Dardanelles, possibly in the hope that a British shell might\r\nput an end to him.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Austria-Hungary had smashed Serbia out of the way and\r\nboth sides now poured out money and intrigue to win over Greece and\r\nBulgaria. But Greece refused to budge without the promise of\r\nConstantinople which was in course of being promised to Russia, and\r\nBulgaria demanded Macedonia. Victories, however, are the most telling\r\narguments when Balkan Governments are sitting on the fence and Great\r\nBritain launched its Dardanelles campaign in 1915, possibly to open\r\nthe road to Russia, possibly to enter Constantinople itself, possibly\r\nto impress Greece and Bulgaria, possibly with all three objects. It\r\nwas here, in holding up the British before Anaforta, that Kemal became\r\na military hero in Germany and would have become the hero of his own\r\ncountry if Enver had not suppressed the story of Anaforta in\r\nConstantinople. Two years later, when it did leak out in the C. U. P.\r\nyear-book for 1917, Enver confiscated the entire remaining issue of\r\nthe year-book and had it destroyed. The British used to tell a story\r\nof Kemal’s defense of Anaforta by way of showing that the Turks were\r\nbetter soldiers than the Germans. According to their version, Kemal at\r\nAnaforta telephoned his German superior, Limon von Sanders, for\r\npermission to attack immediately. Von Sanders refused permission and\r\nKemal, tearing the telephone from the wall in a fit of anger, attacked\r\non his own responsibility and won. The story is doubtless false, but\r\nit indicates the sort of legend which was growing up around a soldier\r\nwho was, firstly, a Turk and who, secondly, looked upon Germans and\r\nBritish with equal coldness.\r\n\r\nThe ending of the British Dardanelles expedition, however, failed to\r\nimpress either Greece or Bulgaria. It did impress Constantinople and\r\nwhen Ali Fethy Bey, Ottoman Minister at Sofia, not only supplied\r\nBulgaria with the necessary promise of Macedonia but made over to it\r\nat once that bend in the Maritza River in which Karagatch, a suburb of\r\nAdrianople, lies, Bulgaria came in and the Enver Government found\r\nitself on the crest of a great wave of popularity. The Berlin-to-Bagdad\r\nhighway was now complete and on the afternoon of January 17, 1916, the\r\nfirst express rolled into Constantinople direct from Berlin, while\r\nSirkedji Station rang with cheers.\r\n\r\nBritish defeat at the Dardanelles was a severe blow to the legend of\r\nBritish invincibility, and the promise of friendship to Islam which\r\nthe Kaiser had made at Damascus in 1898 now offered a possible means\r\nof escape from the vise-like grip of the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907.\r\nThe Enver Government had shown the way out and Persia which had felt\r\nthe weight of the 1907 Treaty most heavily, was not long in following.\r\nThe German Legation in Teheran helped it along with much talk of\r\nKaiser _Hajji_ Wilhelm Mohammed II and that sort of thing, but when\r\nthe Persian Parliament fled from Teheran in 1915 to declare war\r\nagainst the Allies at Kum, the Russian and British Ministers hastened\r\nto the Palace and threatened to complete their partition of the\r\ncountry the moment the Shah left the capital. Thereafter the Shah\r\nremained a prisoner in Teheran, while Russians, British, Persian\r\nNationalists and Turks fought across his chaotic country.\r\n\r\nAs for Afghanistan, the war found the Court at Kabul divided into two\r\nparties, one led by the Amir’s stepmother Bibi Halima which backed him\r\nin sticking loyally to the British, and the other led by his younger\r\nbrother Nasrullah Khan which demanded that he seize the chance of\r\npowerful alliance in breaking out of the Anglo-Russian vise.\r\nNasrullah’s party grew rapidly, despite the fact that the Amir fought\r\nit with every resource at his command. He confronted it personally\r\nwhen in November, 1914, he strode onto Kabul bridge in royal state\r\nand, holding the Koran in his hand, declaimed to his enemies: “These\r\n_feringhis_ (British) are our friends. They are my friends. I the\r\nLight of Faith, I, the Torch of the Nation, have decreed, and now\r\nrepeat my decree, that no subject of mine shall lift a finger against\r\nthe _feringhis_.”\r\n\r\nAs for Islam in India, its position became one of the sheer\r\ncuriosities of contemporary history. Its Emperor in London was at war\r\nwith its Caliph in Constantinople. As the result of the 1907 Treaty,\r\nits temporal and its religious allegiances were thrown into direct\r\nopposition. Its leaders attempted to harmonize this contradiction in\r\nits loyalties by drawing a distinction between its Caliph and the\r\nOttoman Sultan, by conceiving of the war as existing between its\r\nEmperor in London and the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, and by\r\ndemanding an undertaking from the Government of India that the war\r\ninvolved purely temporal objectives and was not concerned in any\r\ndegree whatsoever with the Caliphate. The Government of India\r\naccordingly gave an undertaking that the question of the Caliphate was\r\none for Moslem opinion alone to decide, and on this explicit\r\nunderstanding Moslem troops were enlisted in India for service against\r\n“our brother Turk.”\r\n\r\nThis use of Indian Moslems against the Ottoman Sultan, one of the most\r\ndelicate of operations, formed one of the outstanding British\r\nsuccesses of the war, but Englishmen at home have never succeeded in\r\ndiscovering that British India exists. Forgetful of the fact that the\r\nBritish Empire was “the greatest Moslem Power in the world,” that it\r\ncontained 100,000,000 Moslems to 80,000,000 Christians, British\r\nstatesmen in England publicly referred to Salonica as “the portal of\r\nChristianity” and to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force which later\r\nadvanced into Palestine, as “Crusaders.” At a moment when the\r\nGovernment of India was making every effort to give its vast country a\r\nsense of security, such references in England made Islam in India\r\ninstantly alert for its Caliphate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE ARMENIAN DEPORTATIONS OF 1915\r\n\r\nENVER AND THE ARMENIAN PATRIARCH――WHERE THE ARMENIANS LIVED――AMERICAN\r\nMISSIONARIES AND THE ARMENIANS――RUSSIA AND THE ARMENIANS――GREAT\r\nBRITAIN JOINS RUSSIA IN THE 1907 TREATY――ENVER’S DEMAND FOR BRITISH\r\nADMINISTRATORS IN THE EASTERN PROVINCES――THE WAR AND THE ARMENIAN\r\nDEPORTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Enver Government entered the war, Enver Pasha himself warned\r\nthe Armenian Patriarch in Constantinople against any attempt to turn\r\nthe war to Armenian advantage. This contact introduces us into the\r\nmost intimate of Ottoman relationships and one which can not be\r\nadequately surveyed unless we divest our minds of the Capitulations\r\nand of that attitude toward the Ottoman Government to which they gave\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nIn themselves, the Capitulations dated back to pre-Ottoman days when\r\nforeigners were accustomed to being governed under their own laws and\r\nusages wherever they happened to live. In the golden days of the\r\nOttoman Empire, the Sultans confirmed them and as Ottoman prestige\r\ndeclined, an increasing number of Capitulatory rights grew up outside\r\nthe specific rights originally stipulated in the imperial _firmans_.\r\nIn general, it may be said of them that they conferred a diplomatic\r\nstatus on all Westerners in the Empire, attaching them to their own\r\nConsulates instead of to the Ottoman Government in whose country they\r\nlived. They were abrogated by the Enver Government on Sept. 28, 1914,\r\nin a unilateral declaration which the Central Powers were not in a\r\nposition to prevent and against which the Allied Powers could only\r\nregister their protests.\r\n\r\nBut the Capitulations were more than merely a legal process. They\r\nconstituted a mental attitude toward the Ottoman Government. They made\r\nit the Western habit to disregard that Government and to establish\r\nWestern contacts with its subjects quite independently of the fixed\r\nand existing relationships of the country. Under the Capitulations,\r\nthe West long ago established contact with the Ottoman Government’s\r\nChristian subjects and a code of governmental conduct was unwittingly\r\nbuilt up which the West has applied to that Government alone. Under\r\nthis code, any Ottoman Christian was given the right to rebel against\r\nthe Government but the Government, although it was the only body\r\ncharged with the maintenance of peace in the country, was denied the\r\nright to put down Christian rebellion. This code the West has applied\r\nto no other Government. Orthodox Russia has repeatedly stamped out\r\nMoslem rebellion in Central Asia with as great brutality as the\r\nOttoman Government has ever used against its Christians, but the code\r\nwhich the West has applied to the Ottoman Government it has never\r\napplied to Russia. The West has never acquired the habit of\r\ndisregarding the Russian Government in the country in which it was\r\ncharged with the duty of administration. Russia is a modern growth\r\nwhich has never known Capitulations.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible for us to divest our minds of the last vestige of\r\nthe Capitulations, to apply to the Ottoman Government precisely the\r\nsame code of governmental conduct which it has been our custom to\r\napply to the Eastern absolutism of Old Russia, the relationship of the\r\nOttoman Government to its Armenians may be profitably examined.\r\n\r\nThe Armenian population before the late war consisted of about\r\n1,500,000 in the Ottoman Empire, about 1,000,000 in the Russian\r\nEmpire, about 150,000 in Persia and about 250,000 in Egypt, Europe and\r\nthe United States. Although small colonies of them were to be found in\r\nall parts of the Ottoman Empire, the bulk of them lived in the eastern\r\nprovinces, a mountainous tableland on which, with their Turkish\r\nneighbors, they formed a sedentary peasantry among a nomadic\r\npopulation of Kurds.\r\n\r\nIn none of these eastern provinces did they constitute a majority of\r\nthe population and in this respect they differed sharply from the\r\nGreeks and Bulgarians of the old Balkan provinces. This was not due to\r\nthe Ottoman conquest, for the last of the independent Kingdom of\r\nArmenia Major had disappeared in the Seljuk invasion of 1079, and the\r\nEgyptians put an end to Armenia Minor in Cilicia in 1375. It was not\r\nuntil 1514 that the Ottoman Sultan Selim I, in his campaign against\r\nthe Persians, occupied the modern eastern provinces and brought their\r\ntangled populations into the Ottoman Empire. In accordance with the\r\ntolerance which distinguished the great Sultans, the Gregorian Church\r\nto which the Armenians belonged, was made a recognized community in\r\nfull enjoyment of its ecclesiastical and cultural liberty. Unlike\r\nGreeks and Bulgarians in Europe who did possess majorities and who\r\nconsequently had within themselves all the elements of nationhood, the\r\nArmenians enjoyed in their community institutions the only degree of\r\nautonomy which they could have enjoyed. It was comparatively easy for\r\nGreeks and Bulgarians, once Western ideas of nationalism had reached\r\nthem, to enlarge the autonomy of their own community institutions into\r\nterritorial independence, but any attempt to transfer Armenian\r\nautonomy from a religious to a territorial basis was quite another\r\nmatter. The population of the modern eastern provinces was such that a\r\nresuscitation of the old Armenian Kingdom was impossible and it would\r\nhave remained impossible until some means had been discovered of\r\nre-writing ten centuries of history.\r\n\r\nThat the Armenians were grossly maladministered by the modern Sultans\r\nin Constantinople, there can be no manner of doubt. And so were their\r\nTurkish and Kurdish neighbors. It was in this very maladministration\r\nthat the problem of the modern Ottoman Empire lay, and that problem\r\nwas a Turkish problem as well as an Armenian problem. The Young\r\nTurkish Revolution of 1908 was an honest attempt to solve it by\r\nreviving the Constitution and decentralizing the Government, but in\r\nthe hands of the Committee of Union and Progress the Revolution\r\nswiftly broke down and the problem of the modern Ottoman Empire\r\nremained unsolved.\r\n\r\nAmerican missionaries established contact with the Armenian minorities\r\nnearly a century ago, and began drawing out of the Gregorian Church a\r\nnumber of converts to Protestantism. These converts were so bitterly\r\npersecuted by the Gregorian clergy that the Sultan finally recognized\r\nthem, some time in the 1850’s, as a separate _Prodesdan_ community in\r\nenjoyment of the right to worship as they pleased. Continued Gregorian\r\npersecution threw them increasingly into the arms of the missionaries\r\nwho became a means by which Americans in the United States were drawn\r\ninto touch with the new _Prodesdan_ community in the Ottoman Empire.\r\nIt was inevitable that this touch should bring the Armenians into\r\ncontact with American civil as well as religious ideas, with the\r\nWestern civilization which American Protestantism embodies, and that\r\nthe very real and undoubted wrongs which the Armenians were suffering\r\nunder Hamidian administration should become known in the United\r\nStates. This was in itself an entirely healthy process, but its\r\ntragedy lay in the fact that the missionaries either could not or\r\nwould not make it plain to their supporters in the United States that\r\nthe Turks suffered from precisely the same wrongs. Thus instead of\r\nbringing all the races of the Empire impartially into the American\r\nvision, instead of making it plain in the United States that the\r\nHamidian _regime_ in Constantinople was the oppressor and that Turks\r\nand Armenians alike were its victims, the result of American\r\nmissionary endeavor was to focus American concern on the Armenians’\r\nsufferings alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIEUT.-GEN.

Having broken through the barrier of the\r\nCaucasus Range and established its provincial administrations in\r\nTrans-Caucasia, Russia had transferred large numbers of Armenians from\r\nOttoman to Russian sovereignty, had stripped them of the autonomy of\r\ntheir community institutions and had kept them in order with an iron\r\nhand. In the Russo-Turkish War of 1876, its Armies had halted their\r\nmarch toward Alexandretta at Kars whence they overlooked the Ottoman\r\nArmenians in the eastern provinces. The Treaty of San Stefano which\r\nclosed the War of 1876 was quashed and in the Treaty of Berlin of\r\n1878, Russian provision for reforms to be applied to the Armenians was\r\nagreed to by all the signatory Powers. In the Cyprus Convention of\r\n1876, however, Great Britain had bound itself to maintain the Sultan’s\r\nrealm against Russia, and the eastern provinces, now the most\r\ndifficult and the most important provinces in the outer Empire, became\r\nthe theatre of directly opposed British and Russian policies. But\r\nRussia, despite its resentment at the loss of the San Stefano Treaty,\r\nhad won at Berlin. The Armenian clauses in the Berlin Treaty\r\nreinforced the Armenian disposition to secure redress of their wrongs\r\nindependently of their Turkish neighbors who were equal sufferers with\r\nthem under the Hamidian _regime_. This tendency presently found\r\nfurther reinforcement in the Nihilist movement which developed in\r\nRussia after the Russo-Turkish War. The persecuted Armenians of\r\nRussian Trans-Caucasia joined the Nihilist movement, but their\r\nheadquarters at Tiflis were stamped out by the Czar’s police and the\r\nArmenian revolutionists fled to Switzerland, Paris, London and New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nRelations between Turks and Armenians in the Ottoman Empire had thus\r\nfar been generally peaceful. They both suffered alike under the\r\nGovernment at Constantinople and even when Westernism was alienating\r\nthe Bulgarians in Europe, the Armenians in the eastern provinces were\r\nstill “the loyal community.” But the Armenian revolutionists in the\r\nWest, instead of confining their work to Russian Trans-Caucasia,\r\nsought to raise funds in the Ottoman Empire as well, and the ancient\r\nTurco-Armenian relationship began to be poisoned. Armenian committees\r\nsucceeded in giving the Turks the impression that “the loyal\r\ncommunity” was no longer loyal, and Abdul Hamid replied in the savage\r\nmassacres of 1894 and 1896. For this business the West rightly\r\nfastened the blame upon “Abdul the Damned,” and the Turkish people\r\nwhose patience sometimes reaches the proportions of a grievous\r\nhandicap, were generally exempted from blame.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, the eastern provinces became the scene of an about-face in\r\nAnglo-Russian relations. Under the Anglo-Russian Treaty of that year,\r\nthe two Powers effected an immediate partition of Persia and envisaged\r\na future partition of the Ottoman Empire in which the eastern\r\nprovinces would go to Russia and Mesopotamia would go to Great\r\nBritain. This would have admitted Russia to a military position whence\r\nit could have threatened both the Syrian corridor to Egypt and\r\nMesopotamia itself, but presumably the British belief which prompted\r\nthe 1907 Treaty was that, if Old Russia had made life well-nigh\r\nimpossible for the British in Asia, Liberal Russia which was believed\r\nto have been born in the 1905 Revolution, would prove a neighbor with\r\nwhom it was possible to live on friendly terms in Asia. So Russian\r\nannexation of the eastern provinces became the common program of Great\r\nBritain and Russia alike, and from that date Russia adopted a policy\r\nso liberal toward its Armenians in Trans-Caucasia that a small Russian\r\nannexationist group soon appeared among the Armenians in the eastern\r\nprovinces. The fact must be emphasized that there has never been any\r\nRussian population in these provinces and that the Armenians\r\nconstituted Russia’s only ground for intervention and eventual\r\nannexation.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907 was quickly followed by the Young\r\nTurkish Revolution of 1908. Turks and Armenians alike rejoiced at the\r\ndownfall of the Hamidian _regime_. An Armenian _bloc_ was formed in\r\nthe new Parliament and the Committee of Union and Progress entered\r\ninto apparently amicable relations with it. The bulk of Armenian\r\nopinion in the Empire seemed to be willing to work the revived\r\nConstitution and to begin, in common with its Turkish neighbors, the\r\nreforms of which all the Ottoman races stood in the direst need. But\r\nthe Armenian revolutionaries in the West had already planted\r\nindependence committees in the Empire and drilled them in the\r\n_technique_ of revolution. The committees’ reply to what seemed to be\r\nTurco-Armenian cooperation in the Parliament at Constantinople, was\r\nthe Adana “massacre.” This was on a quite different plane from Abdul\r\nHamid’s savagery in 1894 and 1896, and the principal fault which may\r\nbe found with the Turks at Adana was their tardiness in putting a stop\r\nto it. The independence committees launched it in the approved style\r\nof Balkan revolution, staging it at Adana presumably with a view to\r\nattracting Western intervention at the near-by port of Mersina.\r\nWestern battleships did in fact anchor in the Mersina roadstead, but\r\nrefrained from landing men.\r\n\r\nRussia now loomed above the eastern provinces but during the Balkan\r\nWars refrained from action, possibly in order to permit the Enver\r\nGovernment to defend Constantinople against the Bulgarians, Russia\r\nhaving designs of its own on Constantinople. Still anxious to reach\r\nsome solution of the problem of its eastern provinces which would\r\ncounter the Russian menace, the Enver Government in 1912 voluntarily\r\ndemanded British administrators, as it had a right to do under the\r\nCyprus Convention of 1876. The British Foreign Office turned down the\r\ndemand on the ground that Russia would object to the employment of\r\nBritish in the vicinity of its frontier. Only a year before, the\r\nForeign Office had turned down the request of Mr. Morgan Shuster,\r\nAmerican Treasurer-General of Persia, for the employment of a British\r\nofficer at Teheran and had cited the same reason for its action. There\r\nwas nothing in the letter of the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907 which\r\nauthorized the Foreign Office to forbid Major Stokes’ appointment at\r\nTeheran, nor was there anything in the letter of that Treaty which\r\npartitioned the Ottoman Empire between Russia and Great Britain. These\r\nunderstandings come under the head of what Sir Edward Grey called the\r\n“spirit” of the 1907 Treaty.\r\n\r\nWhen the British Government after the late war dispatched Sir Edward\r\nGrey, then Viscount Grey of Fallodon, to Washington intending to make\r\nhim British Ambassador to the United States, he was permitted to\r\nreturn to London without having taken up his duties. But American\r\nchurchmen have not always been as close to reality as their Government\r\nat Washington has been. American educators in the Ottoman Empire,\r\nhowever, have watched missionary work at first hand for a sufficient\r\nlength of time so that today the oldest of them make the most complete\r\nabstinence from any sort of missionary endeavor the first essential in\r\nthe management of their schools.\r\n\r\nThe British Foreign Office had no sooner turned down the Enver\r\nGovernment’s demand than Russia served its own demands at\r\nConstantinople. The Enver Government appealed to Germany and a\r\ncompromise was eventually effected under which a Dutchman and a\r\nNorwegian were appointed Inspectors-General in the eastern provinces.\r\nNeither of them had ever been in the Near East and neither knew any\r\nNear Eastern language. The war began shortly and neither of them ever\r\nreached the Near East.\r\n\r\nThe Armenian _bloc_ in the Parliament at Constantinople was holding\r\nits 1914 congress at Erzerum in the eastern provinces when the Enver\r\nGovernment entered the war. Government emissaries visited them there\r\nand laid before them the Pan-Turanian project whose immediate object\r\nwas to throw Russia back. A partition of Russian Trans-Caucasia was\r\nproposed, the conquered territory to be divided between Armenians,\r\nGeorgians and Tartars, each to be accorded autonomy under Ottoman\r\nsuzerainty. The Armenian _bloc_ replied that if war proved necessary\r\nthey would do their duty as Ottoman subjects but they advised the\r\nGovernment to remain neutral. It may be assumed that the Armenian\r\ndeputies in the Parliament were still willing, despite the\r\ndisappointments of the Enver _regime_, to work the Constitution with\r\nthe Turkish deputies. The independence committees, however, found\r\ntheir inspiration in the West and their program was electrified by the\r\nprofessed concern for Armenian independence with which the Allied\r\nPowers began the war. The Russian annexationist group was similarly\r\naffected. In their view, Russia’s opportunity to “liberate” the\r\neastern provinces was at hand.\r\n\r\nUnder the 1908 Constitution, the Enver Government had a right to\r\nmobilize Armenians of military age as well as Turks, but armed\r\nopposition broke out at once, notably at Zeitun, a town of Armenian\r\nmountaineers who had long enjoyed an almost complete local\r\nindependence. Along the eastern frontier, Armenians began deserting to\r\nthe Russian Armies and the Enver Government, distrusting the loyalty\r\nof those who remained, removed them from the combatant forces and\r\nformed them into labor gangs whose commissariat, to put it mildly,\r\nworked even more decrepitly than that of the combatant troops.\r\n\r\nWith this situation in his rear, Enver Pasha crossed both the Russian\r\nand Persian frontiers but in January, 1915, he was thrown back behind\r\nhis own frontier by the Russian victory at Sarykamish. This victory\r\nfired the annexationist hopes and armed bands of Armenian volunteers\r\nbegan operating behind the Ottoman Armies. In April, Lord Bryce and\r\nthe “Friends of Armenia” in London appealed for funds to equip these\r\nvolunteers, and Russia also was presumably not uninterested in them.\r\nSeeing that both Great Britain and Russia were at war with the Ottoman\r\nGovernment, it would have been surprising if so obvious a move had\r\nbeen overlooked. These volunteer bands finally captured Van, one of\r\nthe eastern provincial capitals, late in April and, having massacred\r\nthe Turkish population, they surrendered what remained of the city to\r\nthe Russian Armies in June. The news from Van affected the Turks\r\nprecisely as the news from Smyrna affected them when the Greeks landed\r\nthere in May, 1919. The rumor immediately ran through Asia Minor that\r\nthe Armenians had risen.\r\n\r\nBy this time, the military situation had turned sharply against the\r\nEnver Government. The Russian victory at Sarykamish was developing and\r\nstreams of Turkish refugees were pouring westward into central Asia\r\nMinor. The British had launched their Dardanelles campaign at the very\r\ngates of Constantinople, and Bulgaria had not yet come in. It does not\r\nseem reasonable to assume that this moment, of all moments, would have\r\nbeen chosen by the Enver Government to take wide-spread measures\r\nagainst its Armenians unless it was believed that such measures were\r\nimmediately necessary. Measures were taken. The provincial governors\r\nin those parts of the Empire which were exposed to the enemy, _i. e._,\r\nthe eastern provinces and the Mediterranean coast where British and\r\nFrench men of war were maintaining a patrol, were ordered to assemble\r\ntheir Armenians and march them south into the Arab country for\r\ninternment. If these deportations were to be carried out in an orderly\r\nfashion, the strongest and most reliable police arrangements were\r\nnecessary but these arrangements the Enver Government either could not\r\nor would not make. In general, the deportations only gathered the\r\nArmenians together and exposed them without protection to a population\r\nalarmed and angered by the news from Van. They broke down into a\r\ndreadful business in which Armenian men of military age were shot down\r\nin batches and the remnant of women, children and old persons who had\r\nnot already made their way as refugees into Russian Trans-Caucasia,\r\nwere finally interned in Mesopotamia and Syria under conditions of the\r\ndirest want.\r\n\r\nThis business deprived Russia of its sole claim to intervention in the\r\neastern provinces, and the British Foreign Office which shared in the\r\nAnglo-Russian program of partitioning the Ottoman Empire as Persia had\r\nalready been partitioned, has naturally made the most of it. Lord\r\nBryce’s estimate of the number of Armenians who died in the course of\r\nit was 800,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE 1907 TREATY AND THE CALIPHATE\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN PROMISES CONSTANTINOPLE TO RUSSIA――ARAB NATIONALISM AND\r\nTHE HOLY PLACES OF ISLAM――THE HEJAZ BECOMES INDEPENDENT OF\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE――THE BRITISH CAPTURE JERUSALEM――THE CALIPHATE AGITATION\r\nIN INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Russian _entente_ which had been created by the 1907 Treaty,\r\nwent to work in 1914 according to plan, the Russian mill-stone\r\ngrinding in from the north and the British mill-stone from the south.\r\nThe moment of the Ottoman Empire’s final break-up had arrived, such a\r\nmoment as had never occurred before in the history of modern\r\nimperialism and is unlikely to occur again.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1915, Great Britain and Russia wrote the sequel to the 1907\r\nTreaty in the Sazonoff agreement, negotiated in London. The British\r\nsurrender continued. Under the terms of this agreement, Constantinople,\r\nthe seat of the Caliphate and the political capital of Islam, was\r\nsurrendered to Russia and the neutral zone in Persia (exception being\r\nmade for the town of Ispahan) was added to the British zone. The\r\nagreement was necessarily kept secret. At a moment when the Government\r\nof India was exerting every effort to re-assure Indian Moslems on the\r\nsubject of the Caliphate, its contents might have exploded India.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Russian partition of the Ottoman Empire was soon agreed\r\nupon. Mesopotamia was duly awarded to Great Britain and the eastern\r\nprovinces to Russia (without provision for the independent Armenia for\r\nwhich the Allied Governments have so frequently expressed concern).\r\nPalestine, an integral part of the Caliph’s domain, was awarded to an\r\ninternational Western _regime_, and the rest of the Syrian corridor,\r\ntogether with a great hinterland running north-east to meet the new\r\nRussian frontier and east to the Persian frontier, was awarded to\r\nFrance as a buffer between the Russian and British acquisitions. But\r\nthe German drive on Paris made it impossible for France to release an\r\nArmy for the occupation of its zone. Under the military pressure on\r\nthe Western Front, France had no recourse but to recall its\r\nConsul-General at Beirut and to maintain a diplomatic watch upon its\r\nzone. Incidentally, its zone included Aleppo, the Achilles’ heel of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire, which lay only a two days’ marching distance from\r\nAlexandretta which in turn lay a half-days’ steaming from the British\r\nbase at Famagusta on Cyprus. But although the British Government\r\nraised the project of striking at Aleppo time and again, France and\r\nRussia interposed and maintained their vetoes. As a result, the\r\nBritish Egyptian Expeditionary Force and Indian Expeditionary Force\r\n“D” in Mesopotamia were put in the interesting position of having to\r\noperate for four years against an enemy whose military rear was open\r\nat Aleppo.\r\n\r\nIt now becomes possible to reconstruct the British war program. The\r\nCape-to-Cairo-to-Calcutta project which proposed to embed the Suez\r\nCanal in 8,000 miles of British territory running from South Africa to\r\nIndia, was its goal. It was not an incident in the growth of the\r\nEmpire, it was its very climax and full fruition. It was the peak of\r\nBritish imperialism.\r\n\r\nIts center was Cairo and with the entry of the Ottoman Empire into the\r\nenemy alliance, the great British Embassy at Constantinople abdicated\r\nin favor of the British Agency in Cairo. It was from Cairo that Islam\r\nwas paralyzed by the split between Arabs and Turks. If Lord Kitchener\r\nwere alive today, it seems safe to say that he would be the ruler in\r\nCairo of an Arab area stretching from the Sudan to Persia, with a\r\nprotege at Mecca in the person of King Hussein dignified by the newly\r\nacquired Caliphate of Islam. As for the Ottoman Caliphate, Czarist\r\nRussia was to reduce the Sultans to simple Amirs of Anatolia, a\r\nprogram in which the Foreign Office connived and whose result has been\r\nwhat Englishmen since the war have referred to as British “abdication”\r\nin India. We in the West might understand more vividly what “our\r\nbrother Turk” means to Islam in India if we had been in the habit of\r\nentering India by an overland route rather than by the sea route which\r\nwe customarily use….\r\n\r\nGreat Britain’s declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire on Nov.\r\n5, 1914, enabled it to transfer Cyprus to the Colonial Office at once.\r\nIn Cairo, it enabled the British Agency to depose the Sultan’s\r\n_Khedive_ and to set up a _Khedive_ of its own. London’s repeated\r\npledges to France on the subject of Egypt made it hesitate at the\r\nfinal cancellation of Ottoman sovereignty but the situation was a\r\ndifficult one and the British Protectorate was duly proclaimed, the\r\nAgency’s _Khedive_ assuming the title of Sultan. The Agency was now\r\nelevated to the status of a Residency and martial law was proclaimed.\r\nVery soon, German and Ottoman forces struck at the Suez Canal through\r\nwhich British Indian, Australian and New Zealand forces were streaming\r\n_en route_ to France and whose banks were garrisoned with a mixed\r\nassemblage of troops known as the Force in Egypt, a Force uncertain as\r\nLord Kitchener afterward reminded it whether it was expected to defend\r\nthe Canal or the Canal was expected to defend it. The enemy was thrown\r\nback from the very banks of the Canal and, having itself crossed to\r\nestablish the bridgehead of Kantara, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force\r\nmarked time while the _Grand Sherif_ of Mecca communicated the terms\r\nof Arab nationalism to the Residency in Cairo. Arab nationalism made\r\nit necessary for the Foreign Office in London to consult France and\r\nthe result of that consultation was the secret Sykes-Picot agreement\r\nwhich did not long detain the Residency in Cairo and which need not\r\nlong detain us here.\r\n\r\nWhat is worthy of attention here, however, is the fact that Arab\r\nnationalism involved Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem, the three sites of\r\nthe holiest places of Islam. With the Egyptian Expeditionary Force\r\nmarking time at Kantara, Mecca and Medina lay on the southern flank of\r\nits advance and to the north in the lower end of the Syrian corridor\r\nlay Jerusalem. The three constituted a line lying across the line of\r\nthe E. E. F.’s advance, a line guaranteed to all Islam by its Ottoman\r\nCaliph and additionally guaranteed to Islam in India by the Government\r\nof India’s undertaking that the Caliphate was a matter for Moslem\r\nopinion alone to decide. This guaranteed line, however, lay across the\r\nCairo-Calcutta leg of the Cape-to-Cairo-to-Calcutta triangle and in\r\ndue time the Foreign Office handed down its instructions. The\r\nResidency in Cairo began the extemporization of a British Arabia which\r\nshould pivot on Mecca with provincial capitals at Damascus and Bagdad.\r\n\r\nThus was carried into effect one of the most momentous decisions in\r\nthe history of an Empire which once called itself “the greatest Moslem\r\nPower in the world,” a decision which plumbs the depths of the British\r\nsurrender in the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907. The Ottoman Caliphate\r\nwas the last great barrier in front of imperialism. The 1907 Treaty\r\nbroke it.\r\n\r\nThe Residency now lost no time in establishing contact with the _Grand\r\nSherif_ of Mecca. The Ottoman Caliph hurried reinforcements to the\r\nHejaz, but the _Sherif’s_ son Feisal drew a cordon around them in\r\nMedina at the southern terminus of the Hejaz Railway. Although British\r\nofficers directed him in repeated efforts to isolate Medina by cutting\r\nthe Hejaz Railway, the Caliph succeeded in holding it until after the\r\nOttoman Government signed its armistice in 1918, but throughout the\r\nrest of the Hejaz, his garrisons sooner or later were removed to\r\nBritish prison camps in Egypt. In the summer of 1917 the _Grand\r\nSherif_ declared his independence of Constantinople, assuming the\r\ntitle of King Hussein I.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Mecca broke the Ottoman Caliphate. King Hussein had his\r\nown lineal qualifications for the Caliphate. An Anglican-Orthodox\r\nunion had been projected with its capital in a Russian Constantinople,\r\nand an Arab king at Mecca may indicate the disposition which the\r\nForeign Office in London proposed to make of the Caliphate. From that\r\nday to this, the burden of supporting the Hejaz has been transferred\r\nfrom Constantinople to London. Once it was part of the burden of the\r\nOttoman Caliphate. Today it is maintained by a British subsidy. Two of\r\nthe three most venerable shrines of Islam are financed by the Colonial\r\nOffice which, whatever else may be said of it, is not a Moslem bureau.\r\n\r\nWith its right secured, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now free\r\nto advance on Jerusalem. With British officers on its right fetching\r\nFeisal’s Hejaz Army northward toward Damascus, the E. E. F. wheeled\r\ninto the lower end of the Syrian corridor against stubborn\r\nTurco-German opposition. With small French and Italian detachments\r\nposted to it in view of the award of Palestine to an international\r\nWestern _regime_, the E. E. F. finally occupied Jerusalem late in 1917\r\nand, having broken up repeated enemy attempts to recover it, rested on\r\nits arms while the Residency at Cairo converted it into a British\r\n_fait accompli_.\r\n\r\nWhen Godfrey de Bouillon captured Jerusalem in a former episode, he\r\nwaded through blood to his saddle girth to rescue the Holy Sepulchre,\r\nbut mediaevalism has changed its methods. When General Allenby\r\ncaptured it in 1917, he tacked up an “Out of Bounds” sign on the Holy\r\nSepulchre, the Residency at Cairo hurried up one of its _attaches_ to\r\nserve as military governor of the town, an assistant city engineer\r\nfrom Alexandria hurriedly arrived to draw up a new town plan for it\r\nand a landscape artist was hurried down from London to put the new\r\ntown plan into effect. So Jerusalem became a British _fait accompli_\r\nand so it remains to this day. And the new town plan, having\r\npresumably served its purpose, has disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe war has given us all an aptitude for loose thinking and a full\r\nshare of loose thought has attached to General Allenby and his\r\nEgyptian Expeditionary Force. Under our Western political tradition, a\r\nmajority of the population is given the right to determine its own\r\ndestiny, provided it is of a sufficient degree of intelligence to\r\nshoulder its responsibilities. If the faith of that majority in\r\nPalestine happens to be Islam, is not Islam the only one of the three\r\nfaiths to which both Christian and Jewish shrines are equally sacred\r\nwith its own? Has Islam ever failed in respect to the Christian and\r\nJewish shrines in Jerusalem during its centuries of trusteeship? And\r\nwhat has happened to Islam’s shrines in Cordoba, Grenada and Toledo,\r\nin Sicily and Malta, under Christian rule?\r\n\r\nAt the British demand, the Ottoman Caliph finally withdrew his\r\ngarrison from Medina after the armistice in 1918. It is simple enough\r\nto upset the theology of an Ottoman Caliphate, but the British Foreign\r\nOffice, despite the Government of India’s specific undertaking to\r\nMoslems in India, has upset the _fact_ of an Ottoman Caliphate and in\r\nthe last fifty years the fact and the theology of the matters. The\r\nCaliphate has become the symbol of all those Eastern traditions which\r\nare woven into the fabric of Islamic civilization, a symbol thrown\r\ninto vivid relief by the increasing inroads which Western and Russian\r\nimperialisms have been making into that civilization. However narrow\r\nOld Turkish opinion was, however stubbornly it confined the Young\r\nTurks to a rigidly conservative interpretation of the Caliphate, Islam\r\nin India could Caliphate may have come to be two quite separate adjust\r\nits Caliphate to such modern and healthy growths as that of Arab\r\nnationalism. But the forcible imposition of Western civilization upon\r\nthe Arabs was a still further step in that process of Western\r\nimperialism against which the very existence of the Caliphate had\r\nbecome a protest.\r\n\r\nUntil the war ended, Islam in India relied not only on the Government\r\nof India’s undertaking to the effect that the Caliphate was a matter\r\nfor Moslem opinion alone to decide, but on the fact that the Empire as\r\na whole contained 100,000,000 Moslems to 80,000,000 Christians. With\r\nthese assurances, Indian Moslem troops even participated in the\r\ncapture of Jerusalem, but when the peace proposed to continue what the\r\nwar had begun, the Caliphate agitation in India soon became the most\r\nformidable fact in the British Empire. The Foreign Office and the\r\nIndia Office are supposed to be housed on the same quadrangle off\r\nDowning Street in London, but the distance which the Anglo-Russian\r\nTreaty of 1907 has brought between them is one of the sheer\r\ncuriosities of contemporary history. One sometimes wonders, on that\r\nexalted plane on which Sovereigns dwell, what the Emperor of India has\r\nbeen saying to the Defender of the Faith since 1907 and what reply the\r\nDefender of the Faith has been making to the Emperor of India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE COLLAPSE OF CZARIST RUSSIA\r\n\r\nTHE CZAR ABDICATES――THE FRENCH DEPOSE CONSTANTINE AT ATHENS――KEMAL\r\nURGES ENVER TO WITHDRAW FROM THE WAR――MR. LLOYD GEORGE’S NEW WAR AIMS\r\nIN TURKEY――THE ANGLO-RUSSIAN TREATY OF 1907 ABROGATED――PAN-TURANIANISM\r\nLEAPS INTO LIFE ON THE HEELS OF THE RUSSIAN ROUT――THE MUDROS ARMISTICE\r\nOPENS THE BRITISH ROAD TO THE CHAOS IN RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the East India Company’s lead, the Government of India had\r\nlong continued to weave into closer mesh the fabric of British\r\ninfluence which covered the land-locked Persian Gulf. In Nejd, Koweit\r\nand Mohammerah, in the maintenance for more than a century of an Agent\r\nat Bagdad, there lay the seeds of a British Arabian enterprise\r\ncomparable to the great enterprise of British India. The Anglo-Russian\r\nTreaty of 1907 ensued and in 1914 the Government of India diverted a\r\nbrigade of Indian Expeditionary Force “A” for Egypt and France, to the\r\nPersian Gulf where it lay off Bahrein Island to make a lightning\r\nstroke against Basra, the key to Bagdad. As soon as war was declared,\r\nit was heavily reinforced and, having been designated Indian\r\nExpeditionary Force “D,” it moved at once on Basra which it occupied\r\nin three weeks. Its Political Officer urged an immediate advance on\r\nBagdad, but the Government of India was already groaning under the\r\npressure from London. “D” Force succeeded, however, in advancing\r\nslowly north against a stiffening Turco-German opposition until it\r\nreached Kut-el-Amara.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, the tired Government of India suddenly woke up and\r\nordered a bold dash to Bagdad. This turn of events changed the whole\r\nbasis of “D” Force’s operations from the defensive to the offensive, a\r\nchange for which the Force as then constituted was quite inadequate.\r\nThe result was that the Turco-German command was able at Ctesiphon to\r\nthrow General Townshend back to Kut-el-Amara where he was surrounded\r\nand held out for five months while the Government of India launched\r\nsuccessive failures to relieve him. Kut-el-Amara was finally starved\r\ninto surrender, General Townshend was removed to Constantinople as a\r\nprisoner of war, and the Government of India was forthwith relieved of\r\nits command. Indian Expeditionary Force “D” now became the\r\nMesopotamian Expeditionary Force under War Office command, although\r\nthe Government of India retained its political command in Sir Percy\r\nCox.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the end of 1916 that the War Office was ready to\r\nbegin operations for the recapture of Kut-el-Amara, and by the end of\r\nFebruary, 1917, the enemy was in full retreat. On the heels of his\r\nrout, Bagdad was occupied on March 11 and, although the Turco-German\r\ncommand made repeated attempts to recapture the city, its British\r\ndefense held and Germany’s Berlin-to-Bagdad scheme was left in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Armies by this time had not only advanced deeply into the\r\neastern provinces but had occupied their zone in northern Persia in\r\nsufficient force to link with the British in Mesopotamia. A very few\r\nof them had even been permitted to travel to Basra and below it to\r\ngaze upon the blue and British waters of the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nBut on March 12, 1917, the Czar abdicated.\r\n\r\nOn May 16, Kerensky’s Republican Cabinet was set up at Petrograd, and\r\nthe British Foreign Office entered at once into cordial relations with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, the French deposed Constantine at Athens, the Venizelist\r\nGovernment which was imposed on Old Greece entered the war on the side\r\nof the Allies, and ever since the failure of the British Dardanelles\r\ncampaign, there had been an Allied Army based on Salonica, the key to\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nIn July, Kerensky ordered General Baratoff to withdraw the Russian\r\nArmies from Persian soil. They melted away both from Persia (with the\r\nexception of a small force of die-hards who continued to hold Teheran\r\nhoping that the trouble at Petrograd would soon blow over), and from\r\nthe eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 30, General Mustapha Kemal Pasha who had thrown up his\r\ncommand of the Sixteenth Army in disgust after a break with Falkenhayn\r\nover the recapture of Bagdad, urged Enver Pasha to make the Russian\r\ncollapse the occasion of withdrawal from the war. The disruption of\r\nthe country’s economic life and the constant drainage away of its gold\r\nto Germany could have but one end, he wrote from Aleppo. Even with\r\nRussia eliminated, Great Britain and France could not be divided and\r\nthey could not be beaten. The British would conquer Palestine, would\r\nset up a Christian Government with which to hold the Suez Canal, and\r\nwould isolate the remnant of the Empire from the rest of Islam――“a\r\nsound war policy made possible by our entry into the war against\r\nEngland, a policy whose success means irreparable loss for us and\r\nwhose failure means German domination for us…. Falkenhayn has said\r\nrepeatedly to anyone who will listen to him, that he is a German and\r\nis naturally interested first in Germany. If he can hold Palestine, he\r\nwill place himself before the world and before our country as one of\r\nthe great victors of the war. We shall then lose our own country and\r\nto this end, Falkenhayn will sacrifice every ounce of gold and every\r\nsoldier he can squeeze out of us.” But in the wake of the Russian\r\nrout, Pan-Turanianism had leaped into new life. Enver’s reply was to\r\ngive Falkenhayn command of the Palestine front and to exile Kemal,\r\ntogether with Rauf Bey, to Germany in the suite of the Crown Prince.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 7, another revolution lifted its head amid the chaos of the\r\nKerensky administration and Soviet Russia was born, to be attacked at\r\nonce by the British Foreign Office with a vindictive hatred which has\r\nnot even now run its full course.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 5, 1918, Mr. Lloyd George, then barred from access to Soviet\r\nRussia by the bolted Straits, declared in London: “Nor are we fighting\r\n… to deprive Turkey of its capital or of the rich and renowned lands\r\nof Asia Minor and Thrace, which are predominantly Turkish in race…. We\r\ndo not challenge the maintenance of the Turkish Empire in the\r\nhomelands of the Turkish race with its capital at Constantinople.”\r\nThis declaration was interpreted by what remained of the Opposition in\r\nConstantinople, to mean that the Emperor of India, freed from his\r\nRussian incubus, was in a position to renew his old understanding with\r\nthe Caliph.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 1, Soviet Russia abrogated the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907\r\nand the British Foreign Office “shook hands with murder” to the extent\r\nof concurring in the abrogation. But the 1907 Treaty had already\r\nworked out to its ghastly fruition. Nothing remained of Persia’s\r\nindependence but an imprisoned Shah at Teheran. The Caliphate of Islam\r\nwas destroyed, and few countries have ever been flogged into such ruin\r\nas now prevailed in the Turkish remnant of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nOn March 2, Germany imposed its peace terms on Soviet Russia at\r\nBrest-Litovsk, detaching the Ukraine from Russia, embedding the Black\r\nSea firmly in the Berlin-Baku-Bokhara scheme (the old Berlin-to-Bagdad\r\nscheme had been left in the air by the British capture of Bagdad), and\r\nmaking over Batum to the Turks. A Turco-German conference at Trebizond\r\non the Black Sea speedily effected a joint policy for Trans-Caucasia,\r\nunder whose terms Baku was named as the capital of a new\r\nTrans-Caucasian State to be christened “Azerbaijan,” presumably after\r\nthe Azerbaijan province in north-west Persia which it was proposed to\r\nclaim as an irredentum for the new State. An Ottoman Army, accompanied\r\nby a German military mission, now lost no time in moving on Baku and\r\nthe British Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force simultaneously detached a\r\nsmall body which it designated the “Dunsterforce,” hurriedly\r\ndispatching it across Persia for Tiflis in Trans-Caucasia. Turks,\r\nGermans and British raced for Baku, all three determined now that\r\nRussia had fallen back behind the barrier of the Caucasus Range, to\r\nhold it there.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern provinces, the Russian rout had left hardly as much as\r\na street cat alive. In what had been Russian Trans-Caucasia, beyond\r\nthe eastern provinces, three small and quarrelsome Governments bobbed\r\nabout like corks in the chaos, a Tartar Government at Baku controlled\r\nby the local Russian Soviet, an Armenian Government at Erivan\r\ncontrolled by the brigand-patriot Antranik, and a Liberal Georgian\r\nGovernment at Tiflis which feared the Russians and despised the\r\nArmenians. The Ottoman Army drove its way easily to Baku. The British\r\nDunsterforce reached there first but only in time to flee back to\r\nPersia, for the Ottoman forces stormed the city’s hurriedly\r\nextemporized defensive works, installed their Azerbaijan Government,\r\nsigned their treaty of close military alliance with it, organized the\r\nTurkish Federalist Party in its support and set about the task of\r\nfetching all Trans-Caucasia under its rule. Firmly founded on the\r\nGerman Berlin-Baku-Bokhara scheme, Pan-Turanianism had finally become\r\na reality.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on July 3, the Crown Prince succeeded to the Throne at\r\nConstantinople. The Sixth Mohammed took up his abode in the white\r\nmarble palace of Dolma Bagtsche on the Bosphorus. But it was not the\r\nOld Turks who girded him with the Prophet’s Sword. Instead of the\r\nMevlevi _tchelebi_ from Konia, he was girded by the _sheikh_ of the\r\ngreat Senussi order whose seat is at Jarabub in the Sahara. A German\r\nsubmarine had taken him aboard at an empty place on the African coast\r\nand had landed him at Pola. Throughout the crossing, he had said his\r\nprayers five times a day in the forward battery compartment, facing\r\ntoward Mecca by standard compass.\r\n\r\nGeneral Mustapha Kemal Pasha who had spent most of a year touring\r\nGermany and Austria-Hungary in disgrace, was now recalled and given\r\nthe _Yilderim_ group (Fourth, Seventh and Eighth Armies) on the\r\nPalestine front. But it was too late. Amid the din of a world war\r\ncrashing to its close, simultaneous offensives were launched in\r\nSeptember, by the French command at Salonica with Constantinople as\r\nits objective and by the British command in Palestine with Aleppo as\r\nits objective. With General Allenby’s great break-through overrunning\r\nthe Syrian corridor, the French imposed an armistice on Bulgaria and\r\nthe Enver Government fell in Constantinople. Enver Pasha fled to\r\nDaghestan, a dapper young Turk still in earnest pursuit of the\r\nPan-Turanian will-o’-the-wisp, and the Opposition inherited the wreck\r\nwith its capital gripped by a German garrison and French fingers\r\nreaching for it from the Maritza.\r\n\r\nBut the great wheel twirled and clicked. From a French command with\r\nthe Old Greeks in tow, the new Izzet Government in Constantinople had\r\nnothing to hope. From the Emperor of India, freed from his Russian\r\nincubus, it had everything to hope. Secretly in order not to provoke\r\nthe Germans to counter-action, the Izzet Government lost no time in\r\ndispatching General Townshend who was still a prisoner of war on\r\nPrinkipo, to the British naval Commander-in-Chief at Port Mudros\r\noutside the Straits. Rauf Bey, Minister of Marine in the Izzet\r\nCabinet, followed in hurried secrecy with two colleagues. If their\r\nmission was a success, the German garrison in Constantinople would\r\nhave to be confronted with a _fait accompli_.\r\n\r\nIn the cabin of H. M. S. Agamemnon, Admiral Calthorpe’s flagship at\r\nPort Mudros, Rauf outlined the Izzet Government’s program in seeking\r\nan armistice: (1) a return to the understanding which the Caliph and\r\nthe Emperor of India had enjoyed down to 1907; (2) autonomy for the\r\nArabs under the Caliph’s sovereignty; (3) recognition of the\r\nabrogation of the Capitulations; and (4) temporary financial help, if\r\nnecessary. Admiral Calthorpe asked only that the Straits be unbarred\r\nand the road to Soviet Russia be opened. As for Pan-Turanianism, it\r\nmight prove useful in holding Russia behind the barrier of the\r\nCaucasus Range. Clause 11 of the Mudros armistice stipulated as\r\nfollows: “Immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops from North-West\r\nPersia to behind the pre-war frontier has already been ordered and\r\nwill be carried out. Part of Trans-Caucasia has already been ordered\r\nto be evacuated by Turkish troops, the remainder to be evacuated if\r\nrequired by the Allies after they have studied the situation there.”\r\nClause 15 added: “Allied control officers to be placed on all\r\nrailways, including such portions of Trans-Caucasian railways now\r\nunder Turkish control, which must be placed at the free and complete\r\ndisposal of the Allied authorities, due consideration being given to\r\nthe needs of the population. This clause to include Allied occupation\r\nof Batum. Turkey will raise no objection to the occupation of Baku by\r\nthe Allies.”\r\n\r\nSo “hostilities between the Allies and Turkey” ceased “from noon,\r\nlocal time, on Thursday, 31st October, 1918.” The Straits were\r\nunbarred and when the French fingers closed upon Constantinople,\r\nBritish fingers closed with them. General Franchet d’Esperet had to\r\nshare his command with General Milne. Between rows of British and\r\nFrench bayonets, the German garrison marched out of the capital and\r\nthe Turks were relieved that the Emperor of India was once again the\r\nfriend of the Caliph. Allied fleets, to be strengthened soon by most\r\nof the British Grand Fleet from the North Sea, steamed up the\r\nDardanelles and anchored in the Bosphorus. Greek battleships followed\r\nthem, anchoring under the windows of Dolma Bagtsche palace, and the\r\nOttoman Caliph, to spare himself the painful sight, repaired to Yildiz\r\nKiosk which for thirty-two years had been the hermit-home of Abdul\r\nHamid. With Liberal Russia destroyed, the Church of England was soon\r\nto transfer the venue of its theological disquisitions with the\r\nOrthodox Church from the Patriarchate at Moscow to the Phanar in\r\nConstantinople. Five centuries of history were about to be re-written\r\nand Ottoman Greeks in the capital, trampling their _fezzes_, donned\r\nWestern hats in transports of the wildest joy. The remnant of the\r\nOttoman Armenians did the same; both the Ottoman Empire and Russia\r\nwere destroyed and nothing (except ten centuries of history) now\r\nremained to prevent the resuscitation of the mediaeval Kingdom of\r\nArmenia.\r\n\r\nBut the Ottoman capital had been reduced to a supply base for Denikin.\r\nWith an Anglo-French command in firm control of the great city, the\r\nRussians at last began their entry into Constantinople――big Slavs in\r\nuniform who had borne the British to their knees in 1907, huge\r\nslit-eyed men once kings in Kafiristan, now grovelling for crusts in\r\nthe gutters of Galata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE ANGLO-RUSSIAN WAR OF 1918-’20\r\n\r\nHOW MR. LLOYD GEORGE TRIED TO IMPOSE ALONE UPON ISLAM THAT FATE WHICH\r\nGREAT BRITAIN AND RUSSIA HAD AGREED TO IMPOSE TOGETHER IN 1907――THE\r\nANGLO-PERSIAN AGREEMENT――THE “CENTRAL ASIAN FEDERATION”――THE AMERICAN\r\nMANDATE IN TRANS-CAUCASIA――THE RETURN OF SOVIET RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war now began in bitter earnest.\r\n\r\nCzarist Russia had been a weight upon Islam which had increased until\r\n1907 when, in agreement with Great Britain, the two Powers began\r\ngrinding to pieces the last of the independent Islamic States.\r\nRussia’s collapse in 1917 and the resultant abrogation of the 1907\r\nTreaty, coinciding with Germany’s collapse, afforded the British\r\nGovernment a marvelous opportunity to reconsider its policy toward\r\nIslam. The British had no great enemy left in the East, but apparently\r\nthe fact did not occur to Mr. Lloyd George. In the Anglo-Russian war\r\nof 1918-’20, the British Government took over the business of crushing\r\nIslam which Czarist Russia had begun, while attempting to overthrow\r\nthe Soviet Government and re-instate in office a Russian Government\r\nwhich should concur in the fate which the British alone now sought to\r\nimpose on the last of the Islamic States. With Constantinople\r\noccupied, the Ottoman Sultans could be reduced to simple Amirs of\r\nAnatolia whenever Mr. Lloyd George chose. In the meantime, what\r\nhappened in Turkey hardly mattered. What happened in Russia did\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe little Dunsterforce which had been thrown back into Persia by the\r\nTurkish capture of Baku, was quickly reinforced from Bagdad and became\r\nthe British North Persia Force with its base at Kasvin, not far from\r\nTeheran. Here it stood in the heart of the old Russian zone, despite a\r\nsmall body of Czarist die-hards who still clung to the old Russian\r\nzone in Teheran. Meanwhile the old British zone in the southern half\r\nof Persia had been occupied by the South Persia Rifles whose officer\r\npersonnel was British, and early in 1918 the Government of India had\r\ndispatched the East Persia Cordon from Quetta along the Nushki Railway\r\nto the new railhead of Duzdap in the Seistan, whence it ran a lorry\r\nroad north through Persia to Meshed in the old Russian zone and flung\r\nout detachments to occupy Askabad and the Merv oasis on the Russian\r\nTrans-Caspian Railway.\r\n\r\nLate in 1918, the Mudros armistice enabled the North Persia Force to\r\nre-occupy Baku in Trans-Caucasia (where it left the Turkish Federalist\r\nParty in power) and General Milne occupied Batum from Constantinople.\r\nOstensibly to hold Denikin’s rear, the British occupation of\r\nTrans-Caucasia was rapidly completed, the Turco-German forces being\r\nevacuated into the eastern provinces and the remnants of the Czarist\r\nforces being rounded up and dismissed to Denikin’s front. At Baku, the\r\nCzarist Caspian Fleet was maneuvred into British hands and removed to\r\nBritish keeping at Enzeli on the Persian coast. Opposite Baku on the\r\neastern coast of the Caspian, the East Persia Cordon detached from\r\nAskabad a small garrison for Krasnovodsk, and Persia was now not only\r\nheld by British and Indian forces but all its approaches, from north,\r\nsouth, east and west, were in the same hands.\r\n\r\nIn Denikin’s rear, General Milne at Constantinople now commanded a\r\nsingle British front which crossed Trans-Caucasia from Batum to Baku,\r\nwhich made a British lake of the Caspian, and which extended into\r\nCentral Asia from Krasnovodsk to Askabad and the Merv oasis. Over all\r\nof it, the double-headed eagle of Czarist Russia had waved only a year\r\nbefore. Behind this truly remarkable front, railway projects were\r\nspeedily envisaged by which the new British Arabia, British Persia and\r\nBritish Trans-Caucasia were to be firmly bound to each other and to\r\nBritish India, a Bagdad-Teheran-Enzeli line to develop Enzeli into a\r\nBritish naval base which should command the Caspian, and a Batum-Kars-\r\nTabriz-Duzdap line to fetch the frontiers of British India to the\r\nBlack Sea as they had already been fetched to Haifa on the\r\nMediterranean. The Cape-to-Cairo-to-Calcutta triangle had not only\r\nbeen made good, but the collapse of Czarist Russia had made the\r\nBritish a present of the Constantinople-Kabul line in addition.\r\nBritish officers were glum with expectation.\r\n\r\nSir Percy Cox, chief political officer of the Mesopotamian\r\nExpeditionary Force, was dispatched to Teheran as British Minister as\r\nsoon as the Mudros armistice brought the war to an end on the\r\nMesopotamia front, and began formulating the Anglo-Persian Agreement\r\nat once. Persia had then been swallowed whole by the British. The\r\nNorth Persia Force was paying 350,000 _tomans_ a month (roughly\r\n$800,000) to keep the Persian Government in being and 100,000 _tomans_\r\na month to keep the old Cossack Division quiet. Under these\r\nconditions, Sir Percy Cox began negotiations in January, 1919, with\r\nthree Persian grandees and by June the Agreement was ready to be\r\nsigned. It provided for a British loan of £2,000,000 to the Persian\r\nGovernment and for British advisers in the Persian Ministries.\r\nBriefly, it had the effect of reducing Persia to another of the\r\nBritish Indian frontier States. It was finally approved by the British\r\nForeign Office and was signed by the three Persians on August 9. It\r\nhad been drawn up secretly and no public announcement of its signature\r\nwas made until August 15, when it was announced simultaneously that\r\nthe Shah had left for a prolonged tour in Europe. It was to take\r\neffect as soon as the Persian Parliament ratified it. At the moment\r\nthe Parliament was not in session, the deputies having left Teheran in\r\n1915, intending to re-assemble at Kum to follow the Ottoman Empire\r\ninto war against the Anglo-Russian _entente_.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the East Persia Cordon regularized the position of its\r\ngarrisons in Meshed and Merv by styling them “Afghan Consulates-General\r\nunder armed guard.” It will be recalled that the Amir Habibullah Khan\r\nof Afghanistan, a wild country which tilts up to the roof of the world\r\nabove the north-west frontier of India, had stuck loyally to the\r\nBritish despite a fiery nationalist party which sought to carry him\r\ninto the war against the Anglo-Russian _entente_. He was still\r\nsticking loyally to the British when Czarist Russia fell in 1917 and\r\nall of Central Asia fell with it into the most complete confusion.\r\nNorth of him, Bokhara, a smaller country which adjoins the Afghan\r\nfrontier for nearly half its length, had been nominally independent\r\nunder the rule of its Emir, Said Mir Alim Khan, in Old Bokhara City,\r\nbut actually ruled by the Czarist Resident in the Russian cantonment\r\nof New Bokhara. The Kerensky Cabinet at Petrograd continued this\r\n_regime_, but Soviet Russia recalled the Resident and left the Emir in\r\ncontrol. The mutual abrogation of the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907 had\r\nthe effect of leaving both Bokhara and Afghanistan in enjoyment of\r\nactual independence. The Young Uzbeg Party in Bokhara immediately\r\nbegan an agitation for the introduction of Parliamentary government,\r\nbut the Emir Said Mir Alim lost no time in discovering new friends at\r\nMerv where the Government of India’s East Persia Cordon had set up one\r\nof its “Afghan Consulates-General under armed guard.”\r\n\r\nIt had never been possible for the British to dictate their own terms\r\nto Afghanistan as they did to Persia after the Russian retreat, for\r\nthe Afghans are made of sterner stuff. Neither the Uzbegs of Bokhara\r\nto the north nor the Punjabis of India to the south have shown much\r\nlove for the Afghans. As for the Persians, the Afghans could doubtless\r\ndo what they pleased with them. But with the dispatch of the East\r\nPersia Cordon to Meshed and Merv, Said Mir Alim of Bokhara and\r\nHabibullah of Afghanistan reached an understanding respecting a\r\n“Central Asian Federation” which should be “independent of Russian\r\ndomination.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAPA EFTIM EFFENDI\r\n\r\nUntil the Ottoman General Election in November, 1919, an Orthodox\r\npriest at Kiskin, near Angora; after the General Election, “acting\r\nmetropolitan” of the Turkish Orthodox Church.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MELETIOS IV\r\n\r\nOecumenical Patriarch from February, 1922, to July, 1923.]\r\n\r\nThe meaning of Bokhara to British India has already been indicated.\r\nBritish command of the Caspian now isolated the Trans-Caspian Railway\r\nfrom Soviet Russia, and with Bokhara detached from Russia and brought\r\nwithin the British Indian orbit, the only remaining Russian railway to\r\nthe back of India, _i. e._, the Moscow-Orenburg-Tashkent line, would\r\nstop at Samarkand as far as its military usefulness to any future\r\nRussia was concerned. The Russian spurs to Termez and Kushklinsky Post\r\non the northern frontier of Afghanistan which had been nightmares in\r\nBritish India, would lose their meaning. Any future Russian move\r\nagainst British India would be countered at Bokhara which lies at a\r\nsufficient distance to prevent the unsettling effect of Anglo-Russian\r\ntrouble from making itself felt in India.\r\n\r\nBut on Feb. 20, 1919, Habibullah was assassinated. Nasrullah seized\r\nthe throne but, convicted in open durbar of murdering the Amir, he was\r\nunseated in favor of the Amir’s third son, Amanullah. Nasrullah’s\r\nstrong nationalist following rushed pell-mell into an invasion of\r\nBritish India, but was thrown back by the Indian Army. The East Persia\r\nCordon was hurriedly withdrawn to Quetta and the announcement of the\r\nAnglo-Persian Agreement’s signature at Teheran was followed three\r\nweeks later by a Bokharan revolution in which the Young Uzbeg party\r\ndethroned Said Mir Alim and set up its Parliament. Possibly the Young\r\nUzbegs feared a similar British _coup_ at Bokhara City.\r\n\r\nSaid Mir Alim having fled into Afghanistan, the Soviet Government at\r\nMoscow finally concluded military and commercial treaties with the\r\nYoung Uzbegs on March 4, 1921, which purport to recognize the\r\nindependence of the Bokhara People’s Soviet Republic. This is\r\nBokhara’s present title, but the British Foreign Office still\r\nwithholds full recognition from any of the Soviet States. Even as late\r\nas May 8, 1923, a note from Lord Curzon to the Soviet Government\r\ndemanded _inter alia_ the recall of the Soviet Ministers from Teheran\r\nand Kabul, and a long statement by Said Mir Alim on the subject of\r\nSoviet “treachery” was circulated to the London press on the evening\r\nof June 4….\r\n\r\nThe East Persia Cordon’s hurried scuttle back to Quetta early in 1919\r\nstill left the British in control of Persia and in occupation of\r\nTrans-Caucasia and Constantinople. General Milne still commanded the\r\nBlack Sea, the line of the Caucasus Range, the Caspian and the\r\ntrans-Caspian town of Krasnovodsk. Denikin still stood between Soviet\r\nRussia and the British.\r\n\r\nHaving isolated the starving Armenians of Erivan from any possibility\r\nof Russian relief, whether from Denikin or Soviet Russia, the British\r\npermitted Americans to embroil themselves in Armenian affairs as\r\nintimately as they would. If the United States Government had\r\npermitted itself to be rushed into the acceptance of a mandate over\r\nthe Armenians in Trans-Caucasia, it is not impossible that the British\r\nwould have gratefully accepted the barrier between Soviet Russia and\r\nBritish Persia which such a mandate would incidentally have furnished.\r\nThe Armenians had once constituted Czarist Russia’s sole claim to\r\nintervention in the eastern provinces of the old Ottoman Empire, and\r\nif that claim had been disposed of to the United States, not only\r\nwould an effective barrier have been interposed in front of Russia’s\r\ninevitable return to Trans-Caucasia but the remnant of Turkey would\r\nhave been cut off from the rest of Islam.\r\n\r\nBy the summer of 1919, however, it had become plain that the United\r\nStates Government, while anxious to see American relief extended to\r\nthe Armenians, was unwilling to incur an inevitable quarrel with the\r\nfuture Russia, and General Milne in Constantinople announced that\r\nItaly would occupy Trans-Caucasia. Three months later, an Italian\r\nmilitary mission on the spot followed the example which the United\r\nStates Government had set and in September, 1919, the necessity of\r\nreinforcing his Constantinople garrison compelled General Milne to\r\npull in his isolated packet of troops in Krasnovodsk and to evacuate\r\nTrans-Caucasia down to Batum. Will the Royal Army Service Corps ever\r\nissue another ration of caviare in Baku?\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd George now began peddling Trans-Caucasia all over Europe,\r\noffering the Armenians in turn to Holland, Sweden, Rumania, to the\r\nLeague of Nations, to Canada and New Zealand, and even flirting with\r\nTurkish Pan-Turanianism. But the spectacle of Mr. Lloyd George bearing\r\ngifts to the world attracted the same scrutiny elsewhere as it had\r\nalready attracted at Washington. Presumably anybody who was able to\r\nhold Trans-Caucasia could have had the Armenians in those days (except\r\nDenikin and Soviet Russia who alone were both able and willing to take\r\nthem), for demobilization at home was rapidly putting an end to\r\nBritish ability to hold anything more than Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria,\r\nEgypt, Cyprus and Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing continued until Denikin began his retreat early in\r\n1920, which sooner or later would expose Trans-Caucasia to the Soviet\r\nGovernment. Still tub-thumping on the subject of the Armenians, the\r\nBritish Foreign Office now gave _de facto_ recognition to the Turkish\r\nFederalist Government of Azerbaijian, the _Dashnakoutzian_ Government\r\nof Armenia, and the Liberal Government of Georgia. The British War\r\nOffice rushed men and munitions into Trans-Caucasia to stiffen the\r\nthree Governments against the approaching Soviet Armies. The British\r\nAdmiralty hurried out a naval mission to overhaul the old Russian\r\nCaspian Fleet in the Persian port of Enzeli.\r\n\r\nBut the Soviet Armies intercepted the Admiralty’s mission at Baku,\r\nthrew its personnel into jail, and themselves sent an expedition to\r\nEnzeli to take over the old Russian Fleet from beneath the guns of the\r\nBritish North Persia Force. That interception announced Russia’s\r\nreturn to Trans-Caucasia which, since the collapse of Czarist Russia\r\nin 1917, has seen more horrors than any other area on the face of this\r\nsmall planet.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish Federalist Government at Baku was quickly overthrown and\r\non Sept. 30, 1920, the Soviet Government at Moscow concluded peace\r\nwith the Government of the Azerbaijan Soviet Republic which calls\r\nitself “the first Moslem Republic in the world.”\r\n\r\nThe _Dashnakoutzian_ Government of Armenia stood for some time. Like\r\nthe Armenian independence committees of the old Ottoman Empire, its\r\ninexperienced leadership was engaged in appealing to Mr. Lloyd George\r\nand to American opinion to protect it, and had refrained from any\r\nattempt to achieve that peace with its Russian and Turkish neighbors\r\nwhich was the very first essential of its existence. In the Treaty of\r\nSevres, signed at Paris on Aug. 10, 1920, it was awarded a Turkish\r\nfrontier which was to be delineated by Mr. Wilson. The American\r\nmandate project having fallen through, the Wilson frontier was\r\npresumably thought to be the next best method of drawing the United\r\nStates into Trans-Caucasia. The Wilson frontier had the sole effect of\r\ndestroying any hopes which might have existed of a Turco-Armenian\r\npeace. A state of war which neither Turks nor Armenians could afford,\r\ncontinued to exist until December, 1920, when the Turkish command at\r\nErzerum put a stop to the streams of Moslem refugees which had been\r\nflowing out of Armenia, by invading the country and occupying Kars. A\r\nSoviet ultimatum stopped Kiazim Karabekr Pasha at Kars. The\r\n_Dashnakoutzian_ Government fled. The Soviet Republic of Armenia\r\nsucceeded it and Mr. Lloyd George’s interest in the Armenians abruptly\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nCompelled by the necessity of still further reinforcing his\r\nConstantinople garrison, General Milne finally evacuated Batum in\r\nfavor of the Liberal Government of Georgia. Boundary disputes with the\r\nneighboring Azerbaijan and Armenian Governments soon brought the\r\nGeorgian Liberals into petty frontier wars and a revolution in March,\r\n1921, overthrew them in favor of what is now the Socialist Soviet\r\nRepublic of Georgia.\r\n\r\nSoviet Russia was no in contact with Nationalist Turkey and in the\r\nTreaty of Kars which the Turks signed on Oct. 13, 1921, with the\r\nSoviet States of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, the Kars and Ardahan\r\nprovinces which had been wrested from the Ottoman Empire in the\r\nRussian War of 1876, were returned to Turkey, and the port of Batum\r\nwas opened unreservedly to Turkish commerce.\r\n\r\nSoviet Russia was now in contact with Persia also. Here, despite the\r\nfact that the country was occupied by the North Persia Force and the\r\nSouth Persia Rifles, Sir Percy Cox had been unable to assemble a\r\nPersian Parliament which would ratify the Anglo-Persian Agreement of\r\n1919 and in February, 1921, a Russo-Persian Treaty was signed at\r\nMoscow in which Soviet Russia abandoned all Czarist Russian claims on\r\nthe Persian Government and recognized no zones of influence in the\r\ncountry. Meanwhile the North Persia Force maneuvered the Czarist\r\ndie-hards out of Teheran and itself took over the old Cossack\r\nDivision, officering it with British personnel. At the last moment,\r\njust before the North Persia Force was to retire to its base at Bagdad\r\nearly in the summer of 1921, the Cossack Division marched on Teheran\r\nand installed a new Persian Government which valiantly repudiated the\r\nAnglo-Persian Agreement and proposed to share out the Persian\r\nMinistries among the Allied Governments and the United States,\r\nreserving for the British the right to appoint advisers in the\r\nMinistries of War and Finance only. But the Zia-ed-Din Government\r\nlasted only as long as the North Persia Force lasted. Zia fled to\r\nBagdad with the last of the North Persia Force in May, 1921. The last\r\nof the British officers were withdrawn from the Cossack Division and\r\nthe South Persia Rifles were disbanded. At present, neither British\r\nnor Russians are engaged in reiterating “in the most categorical\r\nmanner the undertakings which they have repeatedly given in the past\r\nto respect absolutely the independence and integrity of Persia.”\r\n\r\nSoviet Russia has lifted from Islam the weight with which Czarist\r\nRussia once bore it down and Mr. Lloyd George’s Government has not\r\nsucceeded in its effort to supply alone the weight it took both\r\nRussians and British to supply in 1907. Mr. Lloyd George could not\r\nprevent Islam in India from joining the Hindus in non-cooperation with\r\nthe West. He could not prevent Islam in Persia from following to the\r\nextent of non-cooperation with his Foreign Secretary. That demon which\r\nSir Edward Grey once lightly referred to as the “spirit” of the\r\nAnglo-Russian Treaty of 1907, has been slowly departing, wrenching\r\ncivilizations apart as it went. Its stubborn retreat from the\r\ncountries it wasted and the slow return of Islam to life in its wake,\r\ncomprise the background before which the remainder of this narrative\r\nis set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE GRECO-TURKISH WAR BEGINS\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE AND THE GROWTH OF GREEK NATIONALISM――SURROUNDED BY\r\nBRITISH FORCES, THE TURKS GO BACK TO PEACE――APPLICATION OF THE SECRET\r\nTREATIES WHICH THE ALLIES HAD DRAWN UP DURING THE WAR――THE OECUMENICAL\r\nPATRIARCHATE BREAKS OFF ITS RELATIONS WITH THE OTTOMAN GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs every body knows, a brook called the Sweet Waters of Europe ripples\r\ndown into a long bay called the Golden Horn, which divides\r\nConstantinople in Europe into two parts. On the northern side, between\r\nthe crowded Golden Horn and the great Bosphorus, lie the suburbs of\r\nGalata and Pera, Galata behind the thicket of masts along its quai and\r\nPera climbing the steep streets onto the hill beyond. Galata and Pera\r\nconstitute the foreign suburbs where the Embassies, armed with the\r\nCapitulations, have never permitted the Ottoman Government to govern,\r\nexcept during the four years of the war when they were not in a\r\nposition to prevent the Government from abrogating the Capitulations.\r\nHere were the Embassies and Legations, all of them except the Persian\r\nLegation, although the Ottoman Government was not here and never has\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nBetween the little Golden Horn and the great green Sea of Marmora, a\r\nbold peninsula curls out to Seraglio Point. Here, within the five-mile\r\nwall which encloses its landward side, lies Stamboul to which Galata\r\nand Pera bear the same cultural and historical relationship as Yonkers\r\nbears to New York. Indeed, one could ignore Galata and Pera as\r\nnegligible suburbs of foreigners were it not that by the slow\r\nexpansion of the Capitulations through the centuries, these small\r\nforeign suburbs have slowly turned the capital upside down until the\r\nMudros armistice in 1918 finally ushered the Anglo-French command into\r\nPera in possession of complete authority. Here in Stamboul was the\r\nseat of the Ottoman Government and here are the greatest monuments of\r\nIslam. The broad peninsula on which Stamboul lies is tipped with the\r\ngreat shrines of Islamic culture, its sky-line is pierced with the\r\nminarets of its mighty mosques, of _Ayiah Sophia_, _Ahmedieh_,\r\n_Valideh_, _Bayazid_, _Suleimanieh_ and _Mohammed II_.\r\n\r\nHere in Stamboul also, in the small Greek suburb of the Phanar at the\r\nhead of the Golden Horn, was the Oecumenical Patriarchate, the head of\r\nthe _Rûm_ community in the old Empire. The old Byzantine Empire had\r\nlost its territorial basis in 1453, but it had remained in the\r\npolitical capital of Islam as an ecclesiastical, political and\r\ncommercial force centering at the Phanar. The Patriarch himself had\r\nbecome an official of the Ministry of Justice in the Ottoman\r\nGovernment and was appointed by the Ottoman Minister from a list of\r\nthree candidates proposed by the Holy Synod. Relations between the\r\nCaliph-Sultan and the Patriarch remained generally peaceful even after\r\nthe Old Greeks secured their independence in the 1820’s, and there was\r\nno appreciable Greek nationalism in the _Rûm_ community until the\r\nYoung Turkish Revolution of 1908 called upon Moslems and Christians\r\nalike to give up their dividing community institutions and assume the\r\nequal rights and the equal duties of Ottoman citizens in an Ottoman\r\nnation. That call, accompanied by the opening of the Parliament at\r\nConstantinople, brought Greek nationalism from Old Greece into the\r\nOttoman _Rûm_ community, and the Balkan Wars widened the breach which\r\nwas opening between the Ottoman Government and the Phanar. It produced\r\nso difficult a situation that an agreement was finally reached in 1914\r\nbetween the Old Greek and the Ottoman Governments for an exchange of\r\nminorities, but the outbreak of war suspended its operation. Until the\r\nspring of 1916 the Ottoman Government, in view of the neutrality of\r\nOld Greece, refrained from any steps against its _Rûm_ community, but\r\nwhen the French command at Salonica imposed the Venizelos Government\r\non Athens and brought Old Greece into the war as an enemy, the Ottoman\r\nGovernment took immediate steps to deport its _Rûm_ communicants along\r\nthe coast of Asia Minor out of the range of Allied naval activity.\r\nLike the great Armenian deportations of 1915, these Greek deportations\r\nwere military in their origin but they were far better controlled\r\nthroughout their course than the former had been.\r\n\r\nAfter the Mudros armistice in 1918, these Greeks in Asia Minor began\r\nto flow back to what remained of their homes, and the remnant of the\r\nbroken Empire went back with relief to its peacetime pursuits. An\r\nunsurpassed commercial opportunity lay ahead of Asia Minor, for the\r\nRussian collapse had put an end to the great export of wheat from the\r\nSouth Russian ports. Constantinople, its population swollen by the\r\nAllied military and naval forces, now looked exclusively to Asia Minor\r\nfor its sustenance. Western business men had followed the Allies into\r\nthe capital in large numbers, and money was available in such\r\nquantities as Constantinople had never known. The Empire having been\r\n“liberated” from the “Ottoman blight,” American capitalists abounded\r\nin the capital, all of them anxious to get in on the ground floor of\r\nthe boom. Under the Allied aegis, Western trade faced a prodigious\r\nopportunity and the peasantry of Asia Minor lost no time in seeking\r\nwhatever small share of the melon might fall to them. The spring of\r\n1919 found them back at the handles of their rude, ox-drawn plows.\r\n\r\nBut there were Greek battleships anchored among the Allied men of war\r\nin the Bosphorus, and a Turkish guard was quartered in the great\r\nmosque of _Ayiah Sophia_ in Stamboul. Ottoman Greeks in the capital\r\nhad gone wildly nationalist, finding their hero in Mr. Venizelos, the\r\nman who had brought Old Greece into the war. The Oecumenical Patriarch\r\nat the Phanar had turned likewise toward Mr. Venizelos, the deliverer\r\nof the “unredeemed” Ottoman Greeks. But Balkan wars break when the\r\nsnow melts in the spring. Through the winter of 1918-’19, the\r\nAnglo-French command maintained an outward peace in Constantonople.\r\n\r\nThree British high commands held the remnant of the Empire in Asia as\r\nfirmly in the British grip as Persia was bring held. The Mesopotamian\r\nExpeditionary Force, with its G. H. Q. at Bagdad, had pushed its way\r\nup from the flatlands of the lower Tigris-Euphrates basin into the\r\nrugged hills of southern Kurdistan, the Turkish administration of\r\nMosul withdrawing in front of it to Diarbekr. The Egyptian\r\nExpeditionary Force, with its G. H. Q. at Cairo, had reached the top\r\nof the Syrian corridor at Aleppo and had flung out small detachments\r\nto establish contact with the Bagdad command to the east, and to\r\noccupy Cilicia and the Taurus tunnels of the Bagdad Railway to the\r\nwest, the Turkish administration of Cilicia continuing in office\r\npending an indication of British intentions. Armenian deportees, some\r\nof whom had been interned by the Turks in Syria and some of whom had\r\nmade their way into Egypt to be interned by the British, were being\r\nrun into Cilicia in large numbers and a few of them were being carried\r\non along the Bagdad Railway as far as Konia, where the E. E. F.’s\r\ncontrol ended. The British co-command of the Army of the Black Sea\r\nwhose Anglo-French G. H. Q. was in Pera, had stationed control\r\nofficers along the Bagdad Railway from Konia to its Constantinople\r\nterminus, along the railways in the hinterland of Smyrna and along the\r\nold Russian railways in Trans-Caucasia. The Bagdad Railway had been\r\nbroken up into its two original parts. The Bagdad and Cairo commands\r\nhad confiscated it from Konia east and their military trains were\r\nrapidly wracking it to pieces. Western Europe was not to be again\r\npermitted to escape the Suez Canal. The Pera co-command, however, was\r\nworking the original Anatolian Railway from Constantinople to Angora\r\nand Konia for the _Deutsche Bank_, pending its permanent disposition\r\nin the peace treaty.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Czarist Russia had enabled the British to establish\r\ncontrol not only over Asia Minor but over all its approaches from\r\nnorth, south, east and west, and under the British aegis the secret\r\ntreaties which had been drawn up during the war for its partition\r\n(with the exception of Czarist Russia’s share in them) were soon put\r\ninto application. The French were admitted to Beirut whence they\r\nposted detachments to the Syrian and Cilician centers, remaining\r\nhowever under the British high command in Cairo. Italian forces were\r\ndisembarked at Adalia and rapidly pushed their way into the hinterland\r\nas far as Konia, still keeping their eyes on Smyrna, the greatest of\r\nthe Asia Minor prizes. Smyrna had been made over to Italy in the\r\nsecret agreement of St. Jean de Maurienne, but the Venizelos\r\nGovernment at Athens had entered the war after that agreement was\r\nsigned. As for Czarist Russia’s share of the spoils, the United States\r\nGovernment might be persuaded to take the eastern provinces under the\r\nsupposition that in this twentieth century they still constituted\r\nArmenia. As for Czarist Russia’s right to Constantinople, the High\r\nChurch Party in the Church of England was soon to transfer the venue\r\nof its theological disquisitions with Orthodoxy from the Patriarchate\r\nat Moscow to the Oecumenical Patriarchate at the Phanar. Old Greeks\r\nand Ottoman Greeks are alike traders and British naval command of the\r\nMediterranean served to reinforce the less worldly influences which\r\nmoved Greece inevitably into the British orbit. The French who had\r\nbrought Greece into the war as soon as Czarist Russia collapsed, only\r\nto be compelled to divide their Constantinople command with the\r\nBritish, quickly cooled toward the Greeks and waited for the great\r\nwheel to twirl again.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-French command in Pera soon divided the Constantinople area,\r\nthe British taking over the Galata and Pera suburbs, the French taking\r\nStamboul itself, and the Italians taking the Asiatic suburbs. The\r\nOttoman Navy was quickly disarmed and interned in the Golden Horn.\r\nWith the French controlling the railways in Europe and the British\r\ncontrolling the Anatolian railways, the Ottoman Armies began\r\ndemobilizing and disarming under Allied supervision, skeleton forces\r\nremaining for _gendarmerie_ purposes. So the Turkish remnant of the\r\nOttoman Empire went back to the pursuits of peace and in the lack of\r\nRussian exports the Anatolian peasant enjoyed every prospect of a\r\ngreater prosperity than he had ever known.\r\n\r\nBut to Mr. Lloyd George, it was an opportunity to impose alone upon\r\nIslam that fate which the British Foreign Office and Czarist Russia\r\nhad agreed in 1907 to impose together. They were more than Balkan\r\nsnows which began to melt when the Oecumenical Patriarchate broke off\r\nits relations with the Ottoman Government on March 9, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nSMYRNA, 1919\r\n\r\nKEMAL RETURNS TO CONSTANTINOPLE――TURKISH CONFUSION IN THE CAPITAL――THE\r\nTURKS ASK FOR AN AMERICAN MANDATE――HOW KEMAL AND RAUF BEY LEFT FOR\r\nSAMSUN AND SMYRNA, RESPECTIVELY――THE GREEK PONTUS PROGRAM――THE GREEK\r\nOCCUPATION OF SMYRNA――THE TURKS GO BACK TO WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Allenby’s great break-through in Palestine had thrown Mustapha\r\nKemal Pasha back to Adana in Cilicia, where a cypher telegram from\r\nConstantinople told him that Rauf Bey was on his way to Mudros to sign\r\nan armistice with the British. It was the end of the world for Kemal.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the capital to find an Anglo-French command quartered\r\nin Pera and the entire Constantinople area under effective military\r\noccupation. None of the twenty-five clauses of the Mudros armistice\r\nseems to have authorized such an occupation. The only mention of\r\nConstantinople which occurred in the armistice was a stipulation in\r\nclause 4 that Allied prisoners of war and interned Armenians were “to\r\nbe collected in Constantinople and handed over unconditionally to the\r\nAllies.” Allied “use of all ship repair facilities at all Turkish\r\nports and arsenals” was provided in clause 9 and clause 11 stipulated\r\nthat “wireless telegraphy and cable stations” were “to be controlled\r\nby the Allies, Turkish Government messages excepted.” In accordance\r\nwith these clauses, Allied officers had been assigned to all Turkish\r\nports for control and intelligence purposes. Clause 21 had provided\r\nfor “an Allied representative to be attached to the Turkish Ministry\r\nof Supplies in order to safeguard Allied interests,” but the\r\nattachment of an Allied representative would seem to be no more a\r\nsynonym for military occupation than the use of ship repair facilities\r\nor the control of wireless and cable stations.\r\n\r\nAllied occupation of Batum was provided in clause 15 and Allied\r\noccupation of Baku was mentioned. “Allied occupation of Dardanelles\r\nand Bosphorus forts” was specifically stipulated in clause 1, but is\r\nthe Pera suburb of Constantinople one of the “Dardanelles and\r\nBosphorus forts”? “Secure access to the Black Sea” was stipulated in\r\nclause 1 and clause 7 gave the Allies “the right to occupy any\r\nstrategic points in the event of a situation arising which threatens\r\nthe security of the Allies.” But no such situation had arisen at\r\nConstantinople and it is difficult to imagine how it could have arisen\r\nwith the capital lying under the guns of as great a fleet of\r\nbattleships as lay in the Bosphorus. It is true that the mere\r\nappearance of Allied men of war off the city so affected its Greek\r\nminority as to bring about a most explosive situation, of which Rauf\r\nBey had warned Admiral Calthorpe at Mudros. But a military occupation\r\nseems to be quite a different matter from the temporary landing of\r\ntroops to restrain the Greeks. It is also true that Constantinople was\r\na very useful supply base for Denikin, yet the terms of the Mudros\r\narmistice are down in black and white, with Admiral Calthorpe’s\r\nsignature attached to them, and they do not appear to make an Allied\r\noccupation of the capital a legal proceeding.\r\n\r\nRauf Bey had made it plain to Admiral Calthorpe at Mudros that no\r\nOttoman Government could submit to the re-imposition of the\r\nCapitulations. Under the occupation, the Allies re-imposed them. None\r\nof the Allied Governments had recognized their abrogation, but the\r\nMudros armistice was a military and not a civil instrument. Under\r\nmilitary law, occupying Armies are authorized to administer only the\r\nexisting body of enemy civil law and usage, pending the permanent\r\ndisposition of their occupied enemy territory in the terms of peace.\r\nThe Mudros armistice contained no mention of the Capitulations or of\r\nany other civil matter at issue between the Allied Governments and the\r\nOttoman Government, and their re-imposition during a state of\r\narmistice does not seem to have been a legal proceeding.\r\n\r\nWhen Mustapha Kemal Pasha reached the capital, he discovered that the\r\nParliament had been prorogued, the Izzet Government had fallen, and\r\nDamad Ferid Pasha had been sent for by the Sultan to form a new\r\nGovernment. The Sultan had left Dolma Bagtsche for Abdul Hamid’s late\r\nhome at Yildiz Kiosk, and such sound reforms as the Young Turkish\r\nRevolution of 1908 had succeeded in making, the Allies had speedily\r\nunmade. In its golden age, the Ottoman Empire had been broadly\r\ntolerant, but during its last two centuries of agony the Christian\r\nimperialisms of the West had turned its tolerance to poison and since\r\n1908 its own Christian communities had helped to keep the poison\r\ncirculating in its veins. Its Christian military occupants now\r\nre-injected as much of the poison as it had succeeded in throwing out,\r\nand this in its capital, the very heart of the country.\r\n\r\nWith its Parliament prorogued and its press stifled by a military\r\ncensorship, Turkish opinion was drifting leaderless into confusion.\r\nOpposition parties are apt to suffer in time of war and the late Enver\r\nGovernment had so thoroughly broken up its Opposition that the Damad\r\nFerid Government no longer commanded confidence. The intrigues of\r\nthree Allies, each of them cultivating Turkish support, added to the\r\nconfusion. Western concession hunters and the Levantinism with which\r\nthe capital stank, trailed the slime of money over the scene.\r\n\r\nAcross this unlovely landscape, the Phanar’s break with the Ottoman\r\nGovernment fell like a thunderbolt. Rauf Bey had surrendered at Mudros\r\nto an Emperor of India purged of his Russian alliance, but it now\r\nbecame apparent that the Venizelist Government at Athens had succeeded\r\nto the place in the Anglo-Russian _entente_ which Russia had vacated.\r\nRauf had applied to Admiral Calthorpe for an Anglo-Turkish alliance,\r\nbut it now appeared that no such alliance would be granted and it is\r\neasy to imagine what effect this desperate situation, if it had really\r\ncome upon them, had upon the Turks in the capital. The Phanar had now\r\nbecome openly an enemy in Stamboul itself, the Turkish guard in the\r\ngreat mosque of _Ayiah Sophia_ was heavily reinforced, and a French\r\nguard stacked its rifles outside the mosque.\r\n\r\nThe panic-stricken Turks, still thinking in terms of the Empire, still\r\nblind to the great fallen columns about them, launched their Wilsonian\r\nLeague as a bid for new friends. The United States had not declared\r\nwar against them. The Enver Government had severed diplomatic\r\nrelations when Washington joined the Allies, but the break had gone no\r\nfurther. Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol, U. S. N., a naval officer on\r\nState Department duty, had occupied the American Embassy in Pera as\r\nHigh Commissioner, restricting his communication with the Ottoman\r\nGovernment to the medium of the Swedish Legation pending the\r\nresumption of diplomatic relations. A large colony of Americans had\r\nfollowed him into Constantinople, part of them business men who\r\npresently became restive under the tardiness of the boom in\r\nmaterializing, part of them relief workers who discovered to their\r\nsurprise that Turks have the same number of eyes and ears and legs and\r\narms as the rest of us have. Some of the American colony of which\r\nAdmiral Bristol was the head, afford this somber narrative a lighter\r\naspect. All our American types were represented in Constantinople――\r\ndeep-breathing bishops: apostolic governors of Kansas: “Y” workers\r\nwhose given names were Fred and Henry and Dick: business men who knew\r\nwhat they wanted and couldn’t get it: courteous and correct Embassy\r\n_attaches_: old missionaries with broken hearts and tight lips:\r\nsailors who blew in from Mersina, oiled up and blew out again to\r\nSamsun: young and autobiographical Near East Relief workers: college\r\npresidents who had lived long in the land and were vaguely concerned\r\nabout the Capitulations: young lady missionaries with a sweetly simple\r\nreliance on “these darling British”: and stern “commissioners” of the\r\nNear East Relief on “tours of inspection” who learned from Greeks and\r\nArmenians that the worst they had been told of the Turk was quite\r\ntrue. At the head of them all was Admiral Bristol, equipped with a\r\nflotilla of American destroyers and charged with the defense of\r\nAmerican interests in the Ottoman Empire. He enjoyed what was probably\r\nthe most difficult American position in all of Europe and in it he\r\nproved himself a very tower of American strength.\r\n\r\nThe colony of which he was the head was divided into two sorts,\r\nAmerican business men who looked to the American Embassy for their\r\nleadership, and American missionary, educational and relief workers\r\nwho looked not only to the American Embassy but to the British from\r\nthe Foreign Office in London down to the British Army in Pera without\r\nreminding themselves as frequently as they might have done that the\r\nBritish Army, while one of our most gallant Armies, interests itself,\r\nand quite rightly, in the King’s peace and in no other peace.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any Parliament to speak for than, a number of the\r\nmost influential Turks in the capital formed themselves into a\r\ndelegation from the Wilsonian League and pledged themselves early in\r\n1919 to accept an American mandate over the entire country, provided a\r\ndefinite term, preferably fifteen or twenty years, was named for it.\r\nThis pledge was communicated to Admiral Bristol and forwarded by him\r\nto Washington. If such a mandate would not apply the Westernism of the\r\nFourteen Points to the case of Turkey, it was reasoned, it would at\r\nleast afford the Turks the time they needed to consider their\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWith Turkish civilian opinion now casting about for substitutes for\r\nthe Parliament which the Damad Ferid Government continued to deny it,\r\nTurkish military opinion lost no time in facing the radically new\r\nsituation which the Phanar’s break with the Porte had precipitated.\r\nThe General Staff had constituted the driving force of reform in 1908\r\nand it did so again in 1919. Inside a ring of British bayonets, the\r\nAsia Minor provinces had been turned loose in semi-independence and\r\nwere being rapidly disarmed. The Third Army, reduced in personnel and\r\nequipment, had been permitted by the Allies to base itself on Sivas\r\nand to maintain there a skeleton organization for _gendarmerie_\r\npurposes. Similarly the Ninth Army remained in skeleton form at\r\nErzerum in the eastern provinces, and Turkish refugees were moving\r\nslowly back into these wasted and silent provinces and resuming the\r\neven tenor of their lives. Greek refugees were being returned to\r\nSmyrna and Samsun, a proceeding which would have remained meaningless\r\nhad not the Oecumenical Patriarchate whose communicants these Greeks\r\nwere, become openly hostile.\r\n\r\nThe General Staff had already dispatched agents secretly to the\r\neastern provinces for the formation of local defense committees. Under\r\nthe Allied military occupation, the Armenian Patriarchate at 21 Rue de\r\nBrousse in the Pera suburb of the capital, had openly espoused the\r\nprogram of the old independence committees. The old Armenian\r\nParliamentary _bloc_ had not survived the break-up of the Empire and\r\nthe old Russian annexationist group had come to a similar end with the\r\nbreak-up of Czarist Russia. Independence of Russians and Turks alike\r\nhad become the Armenian program and the hope of its realization lay in\r\nthe British and United States Governments. The former had already\r\nmanifested concern for the Armenians on numerous occasions, and two\r\norganizations were at work in the United States, the Armenia-America\r\nSociety which was related to the Near East Relief, and the Committee\r\nfor Armenian Independence which represented the extreme wing of\r\nArmenian opinion. American relief workers in the Armenian Republic of\r\nErivan in Trans-Caucasia were already urging the repatriation of\r\nArmenian refugees into the eastern provinces, where they had long\r\nconstituted Czarist Russia’s sole claim to intervention and eventual\r\nannexation. Against this move the General Staff had prepared the\r\neastern provinces. Kiazim Karabekr Pasha, commander of the Ninth Army\r\nat Erzerum, had a large quantity of arms at his disposal, some\r\ndeposited by the Ottoman Armies retreating from Mesopotamia and some\r\ndug up from Russian depots concealed in the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Phanar’s break with the Porte was a new development, however,\r\nagainst which the General Staff had made no preparation. Rauf Bey had\r\nsigned an armistice at Mudros with the Allied Powers, but no armistice\r\nhad been signed with the _Rûm_ and _Ermeni_ communities. If war was\r\nnow to develope with the latter, action would have to be taken without\r\ndelay. Accordingly it was determined to dispatch Mustapha Kemal Pasha\r\nand Rauf Bey to Samsun and Smyrna, respectively, to form local defense\r\ncommittees and to meet at Sivas where Kemal was to take over the\r\nadministration of Asia Minor. On the basis of these defense\r\ncommittees, a new political party was to be built up which should\r\ncompel the Damad Ferid Government to reassemble Parliament and enable\r\nthe country to consider its future. The beginning of such a party\r\nalready existed in the capital, but the new National Liberals\r\nnaturally led a secret existence under the Allied military occupation\r\nand it was not until Kemal began building up the party organization in\r\nAsia Minor that they openly became the Nationalists.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of arms to the Allies continued, and in his report to\r\nthe British War Office on events in Turkey from the time of the Mudros\r\narmistice to the signature of the Sevres Treaty, General Milne\r\ntestifies to the honesty with which disarmament was carried out up to\r\nthe time of the Greek occupation of Smyrna. The defense committees\r\nwere not directed against the Allies. Large and small Allied forces,\r\neven Allied officers alone, moved freely about the country. The\r\npolitical program with which Kemal was charged, was directed against\r\nthe Damad Ferid Government, his military program against any partition\r\nof the country in favor of Greeks and Armenians. If the _Rûm_ and\r\n_Ermeni_ communities of the old Empire attempted a transfer of their\r\nhistoric community life from a religious to a territorial basis, the\r\ndefense committees would constitute the Turks’ reply.\r\n\r\nThis program was developed in the utmost secrecy, since the Allied\r\noccupation had loosed more spies in the capital than Abdul Hamid had\r\never employed in his palmiest days. The Ottoman Navy having been\r\ninterned in the Golden Horn, it was an easy matter to dispatch Rauf\r\nBey to Smyrna. He left Constantinople early in May, 1919. Kemal Pasha,\r\nhowever, was a senior Army officer and under the orders of the Ottoman\r\nWar Office. It was assumed that the Damad Ferid Government would not\r\nobject to having the capital rid of his presence, but his\r\neffectiveness in Asia Minor depended on his authority. He was\r\nostensibly to be sent out as Inspector-General with command of the\r\nskeleton forces which General Milne had sanctioned for _gendarmerie_\r\npurposes at Sivas and Erzerum, and the instructions which defined his\r\npowers were shown him as soon as they had been drawn up by the General\r\nStaff. In a room at the War Office, Kemal spent three hours\r\n“correcting” them, until they empowered him with authority to act in\r\nevery contingency which might conceivably arise. As thus “corrected,”\r\nthey were placed hurriedly before Damad Ferid’s War Minister and\r\nsigned without having been read. Duplicate copies, destined for\r\nsubordinate commanders in Asia Minor, were signed by members of the\r\nGeneral Staff. Thus equipped, Mustapha Kemal Pasha left Constantinople\r\nfor Samsun the day after Rauf Bey had left for Smyrna.\r\n\r\nKemal found British craft in Samsun roadstead and a British control\r\nofficer in the town with a handful of Indian troops. Greeks were being\r\ndisembarked and were pushing into the villages in the immediate\r\nhinterland. A project was under way for the detachment of the Black\r\nSea littoral, including the ports of Samsun and Trebizond, from the\r\nremnant of the Empire and its erection as an independent Greek State\r\nunder the name of the Pontus. If the Pan-Hellenic program at\r\nConstantinople proposed to re-write five centuries of history, if the\r\nArmenian program in the eastern provinces proposed to undo the work of\r\nten centuries, the Pontus program also proposed to set aside a\r\nhalf-dozen centuries. It would hardly be fair, however, to judge these\r\nthree programs by the standards of practicability which are\r\ncustomarily applied in politics, for their strength lay outside the\r\nrealm of politics. In 1919, we stood in the presence of a Christendom,\r\ndamp with centuries of Byzantinism, which proposed to commit the very\r\nerrors in Turkey for which it had frequently blamed Islam.\r\n\r\nTo thoughtful Turks, it had long been plain that the old Empire was\r\ndoomed unless it could disentangle itself from the grip of religious\r\nusage. An attempt had been made in 1908 at this precise task of\r\ndisentangling religion and politics. It had failed because neither the\r\nOld Turks nor the Christian communities would permit it to succeed.\r\nChristendom and Islam alike proved immovable. Turks, Greeks and\r\nArmenians threshed themselves to pieces in the religious deadlock\r\nwhich the Young Turks failed to break in 1908 and by 1919 Greeks and\r\nArmenians were prepared to set up new Christian theocracies on the\r\nwreck of an old Moslem theocracy. The _Rûm_ and _Ermeni_ communities\r\nhad clung immovably to their full community rights after 1908 and by\r\n1919 the break-up of the Empire had made possible the transfer of\r\ntheir communities, with the concurrence of Christendom, from their old\r\nreligious, to a new territorial, basis.\r\n\r\nKemal rode up into the hills behind Samsun. Under the blue skies of an\r\nAnatolian spring, he made his way from village to village. He reached\r\nSivas where Colonel Rafet Bey was in command of the skeleton Third\r\nArmy, simultaneously with a rumor that Great Britain had given Smyrna\r\nto the Greeks and that the greatest sea-port of Asia Minor had been\r\nthe scene of massacres by Greek troops. Telegrams to Angora where a\r\nBritish control officer was receiving munitions surrendered under the\r\nMudros armistice, brought a prompt denial. But the rumor grew. What\r\npurported to be stories of the massacres and of the flight of Turkish\r\ncivilians from Greek soldiers in the hinterland of Smyrna, accompanied\r\nit. The British control officer at Angora denied it again, emphasizing\r\nthe fact that the armistice had been signed by the British Government\r\nand no Greek occupation of Smyrna was possible without British\r\nconsent. But a telegram soon reached Sivas from the Ottoman War Office\r\nin Constantinople, announcing that Smyrna had been occupied by the\r\nGreeks and that Admiral Calthorpe had supervised the occupation.\r\nBritish control officers along the railways fled to Constantinople at\r\nonce and most of them were fortunate enough to reach their\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Rauf Bey had reached Smyrna on May 13. On May 14, Admiral\r\nCalthorpe entered the bay with an Allied naval squadron from\r\nConstantinople. The Allied control officers ashore were ordered to\r\ndisarm the Ottoman garrison and confine it to its barracks. At 6:30\r\no’clock in the evening, Admiral Calthorpe announced that the city\r\nwould be occupied by Allied troops the next morning. A vague rumor\r\nthat Greek troops were to be used brought a repetition of the\r\nannouncement that _Allied_ troops would occupy the city. But the rumor\r\npersisted and as night drew on, the population of the Turkish quarter\r\nwithdrew to a hill-top behind the town and gathered around huge\r\nbonfires in an all-night protest meeting.\r\n\r\nBy 7 o’clock the next morning, the Ottoman garrison had been withdrawn\r\nto its barracks. By 10 o’clock, British marines had disembarked onto\r\nthe quai and had occupied the telegraph offices, and Greek troops were\r\nlanding from their transports. They marched first to the _konak_, the\r\nseat of the provincial administration, and occupied the building amid\r\nscenes of growing confusion which the Greek commander either could not\r\nor would not control. From the _konak_, they marched to the barracks\r\nand the firing which had already begun culminated in the raking of the\r\nbarracks with machine guns. At the barracks and elsewhere, in Smyrna\r\nCity and deep into its hinterland, the killing continued for days.\r\nTwice Rauf Bey was overtaken by the rapid Greek advance and had to\r\nflee farther into the hinterland. Events might or might not have\r\nturned out differently if Rauf had landed at Smyrna a month before he\r\ndid, but one reason for the lack of any Turkish defense of Smyrna was\r\nthe quite simple reason that there had been no time in which to\r\nprepare a defense.\r\n\r\nIt was disastrous news which Rauf conveyed through the interior as he\r\ncontinued on his way to join Kemal at Sivas. It affected the Turks far\r\nmore than even the Armenian sack of Van had affected them, for in 1915\r\nthe Enver Government had at least not been disarmed. Even in\r\nConstantinople itself, Turkish opinion became so inflamed against the\r\nDamad Ferid Government that machine guns were mounted on Galata Bridge\r\nand the Allied High Commissioners were finally compelled to dispatch\r\nan inter-Allied Commission, headed by Admiral Bristol, to put a stop\r\nto the killing behind Smyrna. The Bristol Commission drew up a lengthy\r\nreport which fixed immediate responsibility for the Smyrna affair, and\r\nMr. Lloyd George suppressed it at the demand of Mr. Venizelos. By such\r\nsuppressions has the martyr-legend of Near Eastern Christians grown.\r\n\r\nThe Greek occupation of Smyrna shook the world, from the back hills of\r\nJava to the country towns of the United States. Down in the Turkish\r\ncockpit, the Damad Ferid Government became an Allied puppet, Mustapha\r\nKemal Pasha brought the skeleton Third Army down to Amasia to prevent\r\na similar Greek landing at Samsun, a Turkish fighting front was\r\nhurriedly extemporized against the Armenians who were gathering under\r\nthe Anglo-French aegis in Cilicia, and Kiazim Karabekr Pasha hewed out\r\na back door to Central Asia past the Armenian Republic of Erivan in\r\nTrans-Caucasia. In the United States, the religious press opened its\r\ncolumns to every atrocity-charge against the Turks which Greek and\r\nArmenian minds could devise. In India, pious Moslems began trekking\r\nacross the north-west frontier into Afghanistan, fleeing the British\r\nGovernment at Delhi with motives similar to those with which the\r\nPilgrim Fathers once fled from England. Down in the hinterland of\r\nSmyrna, the West stood with bayonets fixed, confronting an East which\r\nhad been largely disarmed.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be unquestioned that no clause of the Mudros armistice\r\nauthorized the Allies to occupy Smyrna. The only clause which has been\r\nadvanced as possibly covering the occupation, is clause 7 which gives\r\nthe Allies “the right to occupy any strategic points in the event of a\r\nsituation arising which threatens the security of the Allies.” None of\r\nthe dozen Allied officers who had been posted to Smyrna has ever\r\nclaimed that a situation existed there which threatened even their own\r\nsecurity, to say nothing of the security of the Allies. Mustapha Kemal\r\nPasha at Sivas interpreted the occupation as a violation of the\r\narmistice by the Allies themselves and held it accordingly as no\r\nlonger binding. The surrender of munitions to the Allies ceased\r\nimmediately. The Anatolian peasant left his growing crops and went\r\nangrily back to war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE ORTHODOX SCHISM IN ANATOLIA\r\n\r\nKEMAL FALLS TO THE STATUS OF A “BANDIT”――TURKISH NATIONALISM BEGINS TO\r\nRE-MOBILIZE AND RE-EQUIP ITS FORCES――THE ERZERUM PROGRAM AND THE\r\nNATIONALIST VICTORY IN THE OTTOMAN ELECTIONS――HOW PAPA EFTIM EFFENDI\r\nBROKE WITH THE OECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE――THE TURKISH ORTHODOX\r\nCHURCH――PAPA EFTIM HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd George had announced his program at Smyrna. He proposed to\r\nbuild a new Near East on the basis of its Christian minorities,\r\nconfronting Soviet Russia with a Greek _fait accompli_ across the\r\nStraits on a parity with the American mandate in Trans-Caucasia and\r\nthe eastern provinces, the British Persia and the Afghan-Bokharan\r\nbusiness with which it was proposed to confront it elsewhere. As for\r\nIslam, he would impose alone upon it that fate which the British\r\nForeign Office and Czarist Russia had agreed in 1907 to impose\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe reply to this program was Turkish Nationalism. Rid of the burden\r\nof the old Empire, freed of sole responsibility for the Caliphate,\r\nMustapha Kemal Pasha proposed to break the religious deadlock in which\r\nthe Turks had threshed themselves to pieces and to apply the same\r\nWesternism to his own nation as the West had long applied to its\r\nGreeks and Armenians. Such Old Turkish strongholds as the dervish\r\n_tekkes_ at Konia might oppose him, but the Old Turks had no Western\r\nbacking and Islam in India felt so deeply on the subject of “our\r\nbrother Turk” that success in maintaining the last of the independent\r\nMoslem States would prove its own justification. As for Greeks and\r\nArmenians, they could continue to worship in their own way as they had\r\nalways done under the old Empire, but they would never again be\r\npermitted to poison the country with their political reaction.\r\n\r\nInside a ring of British and Greek bayonets, the Turks flocked to the\r\nnew Nationalist Party, not because the mass of Turkish opinion had any\r\nunderstanding of the meaning of nationalism but because Smyrna had\r\nstripped the Damad Ferid Government in Constantinople of the very\r\nsmall Turkish support with which it had entered office. Beginning in\r\nthe eastern provinces which were farthest from the capital, the\r\ndefense committees which constituted the framework of the Party,\r\narrested Damad Ferid’s provincial officials and deported them to\r\nConstantinople, installing Nationalist administrations in their\r\nplaces. This proceeded so rapidly that Ferid telegraphed Kemal to\r\nreturn to the capital at once. Despite the fact that Ferid’s orders\r\nbore all the prestige of the _Grand Vizierate_, Kemal disregarded them\r\nand on July 11, 1919, Ferid dismissed him from the Army. From a senior\r\nofficer and a military hero, Kemal now fell to the status of a\r\n“bandit,” who knew in all probability that it was only a matter of\r\ntime until he would be caught and shot.\r\n\r\nThe Nationalist Party had a dual program. Its political objective was\r\nto compel the Damad Ferid Government in Constantinople to re-assemble\r\nParliament and permit the country to consider its future. Its military\r\nobjective was to prevent the further partition of what it believed to\r\nbe Turkish soil. Under the impetus of Smyrna, it was comparatively\r\neasy to take over province after province in Asia Minor and to put the\r\nGovernment in a position in which it would sooner or later be\r\ncompelled to reckon with its new Opposition. Its military objective\r\nwas far less easy of attainment. About 20,000 troops had been\r\npermitted to remain at Sivas and Erzerum for _gendarmerie_ purposes. A\r\nquantity of munitions, particularly in the eastern provinces, had not\r\nyet been surrendered. A further quantity was dug up from old Russian\r\ndepots, concealed during the great Russian advance of 1915-’16. More\r\nwere smuggled across the Black Sea from Denikin’s rear in South\r\nRussia, as soon as it became known that a market for arms had\r\ndeveloped in Asia Minor. Still more, particularly artillery, had been\r\ndismantled by the Allies and left in Turkish possession; these needed\r\nonly new breech-blocks and range-finders, the construction of which\r\nbegan at once out of any scrap metal available. Hidden away in the\r\nsecrecy of Asia Minor, Nationalism began to re-mobilize and re-equip\r\nits tattered and frequently bare-footed soldiers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSEMBLY BUILDING AT ANGORA]\r\n\r\nSo rapidly did the Party grow that two months after the Smyrna\r\noccupation, Kemal and Rauf were able to assemble it in a caucus at\r\nErzerum in the eastern provinces. Kemal’s staff drove up to Erzerum\r\nalong the crude mountain roads with the rest of the provincial\r\ndelegates, but Kemal himself rode alone over back trails and through\r\nlonely villages. Here in the wrecked mountain town of Erzerum, the\r\nParty platform was drawn up, a document which was later to become\r\nfamous under the name of the National Pact.\r\n\r\nThis document re-stated and amplified the Izzet Government’s position,\r\nas Rauf Bey had conveyed it to Admiral Calthorpe at Mudros. Autonomy\r\nfor the Arabs under the necessary suzerainty of the Caliph at\r\nConstantinople and Allied recognition of the Enver Government’s\r\nabrogation of the Capitulations, were its principal planks. The\r\nbreak-up of the old Empire was accepted and in the new map of the Near\r\nand Middle East, the Caliphate of Islam was modified to permit the\r\napplication of the Western tradition of nationalism to Turks and Arabs\r\nalike, an application to which the Turks claimed as complete a right\r\nas the West had long before acknowledged to Greeks, Bulgarians and\r\nArmenians. From the Greeks, the West had never asked Capitulations. It\r\nwould therefore not ask Capitulations from the Turks. As for the\r\nrights of minorities, such rights as the Greeks gave their Moslem\r\nminorities, the Turks would give their Christian minorities. The\r\nStraits would remain open to world commerce, subject only to the\r\nnecessary military security of Constantinople, “the seat of the\r\nCaliphate of Islam, the capital of the Sultanate, and the headquarters\r\nof the Ottoman Government.” In the delineation of the new Turkey’s\r\nfrontiers, certain border areas were under dispute. Two of these\r\nborder areas, Cilicia and the Mosul province, “are inhabited by an\r\nOttoman Moslem majority united in religion, in race and in aim, imbued\r\nwith sentiments of mutual respect for each other and of sacrifice, and\r\nwholly respectful of each other’s racial and social rights and\r\nsurrounding conditions,” and these belonged within the Turkish\r\nfrontiers. To certain other border areas (Western Thrace and the three\r\ndistricts of Kars, Ardahan and Batum in Trans-Caucasia), the West\r\ncould, if it wished, apply the device of the plebiscite with which it\r\nwas accustomed to decide the destinies of populations elsewhere. As\r\nfor the place of the new Turkey in the family of nations, the Party\r\nrepeated Rauf Bey’s statements to Admiral Calthorpe at Mudros: “It is\r\na fundamental condition of our life and continued existence that we,\r\nlike every country, should enjoy complete independence and liberty in\r\nthe matter of assuring the means of our development, in order that our\r\nnational and economic development should be rendered possible and that\r\nit should be possible to conduct affairs in the form of a more\r\nup-to-date regular administration.” On this note, the Party’s platform\r\nclosed. Three weeks later, a copy of it lay on Lord Curzon’s desk in\r\nthe Foreign Office in London, and Colonel Alfred Rawlinson, a brother\r\nof Lord Rawlinson, Commander-in-Chief in India, was returned to\r\nErzerum to learn what it was that Kemal really wanted.\r\n\r\nHaving drawn up the Party’s platform, the Erzerum caucus adjourned to\r\nmeet in September at Sivas, where a standing council of twelve members\r\nwas chosen to sit continuously at Angora, a provincial capital whose\r\nrail and telegraphic communication with Constantinople was more direct\r\nthan Sivas’s. The Damad Ferid Government’s position with respect to\r\nthe country had now become so impossible that it fell on October 5 and\r\nwas replaced by the Ali Riza Government which was authorized by the\r\nSultan to hold a general election. This was a clean-cut victory for\r\nthe Nationalists and two days after the new Government took office,\r\nKemal telegraphed the Party’s platform to Ali Riza Pasha in\r\nConstantinople, as the terms of peace on which the Nationalists\r\nappealed to the country.\r\n\r\nAt this junction, the Oecumenical Patriarchate at the Phanar forbade\r\nOttoman Greeks to participate in the elections on the ground that they\r\nwere no longer Ottoman subjects. This injunction was of course obeyed\r\nin the capital where Allied troops were in occupation, but a\r\nconsiderable portion of the _Rûm_ community lived in Asia Minor and\r\nhere, already gravely compromised with their Turkish neighbors by the\r\nPhanar’s break with the Porte and by the Greek occupation of Smyrna\r\nwhich had followed that break, it only added to their difficulties.\r\nIndeed, it is difficult to imagine what move more dangerous to its own\r\ncommunicants in Asia Minor the Phanar could have made. It so increased\r\nthe suspicion which attached to them in the eyes of the Nationalists\r\nthat hundreds of them were clapped into Nationalist jails and were not\r\nreleased until a Turkish-speaking Orthodox priest from Kiskin, twelve\r\nmiles from Angora, announced his intention of breaking with the Phanar\r\nand participating in the elections as an Ottoman subject. He\r\nimmediately undertook to effect a similar break on the part of the\r\nTurkish-speaking Orthodox churches in the interior, and the\r\nOecumenical Patriarch summoned him to report at the Phanar at once. He\r\ndisregarded both the Phanar’s summons and the excommunication which\r\nfollowed it, and continued to align his people with the Nationalists.\r\n\r\nPapa Eftim Effendi, acting metropolitan of the Turkish Orthodox\r\nChurch, is a subject to be approached with all caution for he may yet\r\ndevelope into a phase of the new Turkey more important for Christendom\r\nthan Kemal himself. Christian solidarity broke down when the Phanar\r\nthrew its communicants in Asia Minor into a political position which\r\nbrooked not an instant’s neutrality. As long as Ottoman Christians\r\nwere given an inferior position under Moslem law, the concern of\r\nWestern Christians for the _Rûm_ and _Ermeni_ communities of the old\r\nEmpire had a legitimate basis. The Byzantinism which colored our\r\nWestern concern for Ottoman Greeks and Armenians may have blinded us\r\nat times to the actual position they occupied in the old Empire, but\r\nthe legal position which Moslem law gave them was certain ultimately\r\nto be resented. There came a time when thoughtful Turks agreed with\r\nus, not out of concern for non-Moslems but in the belief that the\r\nEmpire was being slowly strangled by the religious usages which had\r\ntightened about it. The Young Turks made an honest attempt in 1908 at\r\nreforms designed ultimately to give all races of the Empire an equal\r\nposition as Ottoman citizens in an Ottoman State. That attempt broke\r\ndown for several reasons. One was that the Young Turkish program was\r\nrepugnant to Islam. Another was that the _Rûm_ and _Ermeni_\r\ncommunities stuck to every jot of their community rights. Whether\r\nrightly or wrongly, they would not be given a common position with\r\ntheir Moslem neighbors. To American missionaries on the spot, the\r\nfailure of the Young Turkish program was a bitter disappointment for\r\nthey knew what the price of failure would be to Turks, Greeks and\r\nArmenians alike. But American Protestantism in the United States\r\ngenerally concurred in the refusal of the Ottoman Christians to make\r\nthat gesture of confidence without which the Young Turkish program was\r\nbound to fail. The missionaries knew that if the religious deadlock\r\nwhich the 1908 Revolution sought to break, had finally to be broken by\r\nforce, only Western military intervention could save the Christians\r\nfrom defeat. But their tongues were tied in the United States.\r\nChurchmen at home stiffened the Greeks and Armenians while refusing to\r\nnote the very grave problems for which it was essential that the Turks\r\nshould discover a solution.\r\n\r\nPapa Eftim Effendi, however, has made the gesture of confidence. Under\r\nhis leadership, sixty-eight Orthodox churches in the interior gave up\r\ntheir church schools on March 1, 1922, their pupils being sent\r\nthereafter to the Government’s schools. The old _Rûm_ community\r\nregarded its schools with considerable pride, for they were centers of\r\nGreek nationalism. In the old Empire, they were centers of Orthodox\r\nreaction just as the mosque schools were centers of Moslem reaction.\r\nThese churches in the interior have given up their right to administer\r\nOrthodox civil law. Turkish courts, under the Ministry of Justice, now\r\nadminister Orthodox law for Orthodox litigants, supposedly as British\r\ncourts administer Moslem law in India. The churches which have formed\r\nthe new Turkish Orthodox Church under Papa Eftim’s leadership, are as\r\nfree to worship as they have always been (and that freedom has been\r\npossibly greater than Westerners have sometimes attributed to the\r\nOttoman Government). Politically, however, their communicants have\r\nthrown in their lot with the Turks. Their clergy wear the black robe\r\nand black cylindrical hat of Orthodoxy only while engaged in their\r\nclerical duties. At all other times, they wear the Turkish _kalpak_.\r\n\r\nBut the wider interest which gathers around Papa Eftim at present lies\r\nin the fact that he has destroyed the old basis of Christian\r\nsolidarity and has opened up the possibility of a quite new basis. The\r\nold solidarity, whether rightly or wrongly, has levied a fearful toll\r\nupon Turks, Greeks and Armenians alike during these last few years.\r\nBut it is just possible that Papa Eftim has given us the prospect of a\r\nnew solidarity upon a purely religious basis. It is a prospect to be\r\napproached with all reserve, for it suggests a new Western attitude\r\ntoward the Near and Middle East whose benefits both to Christendom and\r\nto Islam may prove to be incalculable. Time will develope Papa Eftim’s\r\nfull significance. Unless hostility to the Turk is an article of the\r\nChristian creed, his is the most meaningful figure in Turkey today.\r\n\r\nA note reached me late one morning during my stay in Angora, to the\r\neffect that Papa Eftim Effendi was in the city and was anxious to\r\ncall. Two hours later, Djelal Noury Bey, a prominent Turkish editor\r\nand a deputy in the Grand National Assembly, entered with Papa Eftim\r\nfollowing. Eftim was a black-eyed, bushy little man and the figure he\r\npresented, a Turkish _kalpak_ resting on his uncut Orthodox hair and\r\nhis long Orthodox beard flowing over the turned-up collar of a\r\nwolfskin coat, is one which may be commended to those who knew the old\r\nOttoman Empire. The following dialogue ensued:\r\n\r\nSelf (to Papa Eftim): Are you a Turk?\r\n\r\nDjelal Noury (smiling): He is of the Turkish race.\r\n\r\nSelf (to Papa Eftim): Are you of Turkish blood?\r\n\r\nDjelal Noury (smiling cordially): The Turkish Orthodox Church was his\r\nown idea. He organized it himself.\r\n\r\nSelf (to Papa Eftim): Do you speak Turkish?\r\n\r\nDjelal Noury (still smiling cordially): He wants to go to the League\r\nof Nations at Geneva. He asks do you think he ought to go?\r\n\r\nSelf (to Papa Eftim): Are you a Turk?\r\n\r\nDjelal Noury (smiling still more cordially): He asks whether you may\r\nbe a Protestant. He says if you are, you and he are the same for\r\nneither of you recognize the Pope.\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing seemed to be of no profit to any of us and the\r\nmatter was accordingly allowed to drop, Djelal Noury leaving with Papa\r\nEftim carefully in tow. We Westerners of course are quite superior to\r\nthis device of the carefully staged interview, since our own\r\npoliticians in the West are as indifferent to publicity as a cat is to\r\ncatnip.\r\n\r\nA half-hour later, a Turk happened to call and in the most casual\r\nfashion asked what opinion I had formed of Papa Eftim. I told him I\r\nhad formed the highest opinion of his chaperone but had had no\r\nopportunity to form any opinion of Eftim himself. Something apparently\r\nhappened behind the scenes during the next day or two for two evenings\r\nlater, Papa Eftim unexpectedly knocked at my door and entered stark\r\nalone. It was two hours afterward when he left and during those two\r\nhours nobody interrupted us. I believe that no lawyer ever put a\r\nwitness through a more thorough examination than I put Papa Eftim on\r\nthat evening. When he left, his pale thin hands shook with emotion. As\r\nhe went out, he stopped in the door-way and this is what he said:\r\n“This is our country and the Turks are our own people. How can we\r\nforsake our country when it needs us?”\r\n\r\nI have no means of knowing who put this strangely Western idea into\r\nPapa Eftim’s head originally. Certainly it was not that stronghold of\r\nEasternism, the Oecumenical Patriarchate. Wherever it did come from, I\r\nbelieve there is not the slightest question of the sincerity with\r\nwhich Papa Eftim holds it today. His is the almost fanatical sincerity\r\nof a minority which feels itself misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe morning after I talked with him, a Turk happened to call and in\r\nthe most casual fashion asked what opinion I had formed of Papa Eftim.\r\nI made him a non-committal answer to the effect that he seemed to me\r\nto be the merest shadow of a man physically to be cast in such a great\r\n_role_. Fifteen minutes after my Turkish caller left, my door opened\r\nand the largest Orthodox priest I have ever seen loomed in the\r\ndoor-way, a vast ignorant mound of a man who announced unctuously that\r\nhe was one of Papa Eftim’s assistants in the Turkish Orthodox Church.\r\nI looked him over slowly from his huge feet all the way up to his\r\nuncut Orthodox beard and the Turkish _kalpak_ stuck on top of it,\r\nwhile he watched me with the black ox-like eyes of a people whom no\r\nman has ever long succeeded in budging unless they were willing to be\r\nbudged. Then I thanked him and told him he would do quite nicely. He\r\nturned slowly and the stairs creaked beneath his tread as he went\r\nponderously away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE TREATY OF SEVRES\r\n\r\nRAUF BEY TAKES THE NATIONALIST DEPUTIES FROM ANGORA TO CONSTANTINOPLE――\r\nINDIA COMPELS MR. LLOYD GEORGE TO LEAVE CONSTANTINOPLE TO THE TURK AND\r\nGENERAL MILNE BREAKS UP THE PARLIAMENT, DEPORTING RAUF AND MANY OF HIS\r\nCOLLEAGUES TO MALTA――THE SEVRES TREATY AND HOW DAMAD FERID PASHA\r\nSECURED AUTHORITY TO SIGN IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elections which the Ali Riza Government held, resulted in a clean\r\nsweep for the Nationalists and a situation of considerable delicacy\r\nwas now precipitated. It was hardly possible for the new Parliament,\r\ncharged with the execution of the Erzerum program, to function freely\r\nunder the enemy occupation in the capital. On the other hand, it was\r\nthe country’s legally elected Parliament and it was highly desirable\r\nthat it should be recognized as such. Pending decision as to its\r\ncourse, its deputies assembled at Angora where the Party’s standing\r\ncouncil was in session in the gray granite building which had once\r\nbeen the provincial headquarters of the Committee of Union and\r\nProgress. Here an intimation reached the deputies that the Allies were\r\nprepared to recognize the new Parliament if its session was held in\r\nthe capital and was opened in a legal fashion by the Sultan’s speech,\r\nbut that it would not be recognized if it met in Angora. Accordingly a\r\nlarge proportion of the deputies, headed by Rauf Bey, the\r\nParliamentary leader of the Party, left Angora for Constantinople and\r\non Jan. 11, 1920, the new Ottoman Parliament opened its session.\r\nDespite the conditions of military occupation under which it met, Rauf\r\nBey discharged his duties with inflexible courage and on January 28,\r\nthe Erzerum program, now known as the Turkish National Pact, was\r\nlegally adopted by the legal Parliament sitting in its legal capital.\r\n\r\nTrouble was now plainly in the air. Only the day before the adoption\r\nof the Pact, the re-mobilizing Nationalist forces in Asia Minor had\r\nraided a dump of surrendered munitions on the Gallipoli peninsula.\r\nBehind its Asiatic suburbs, their forces had crept into the very\r\noutskirts of Constantinople. The Allied occupation was becoming a\r\ntouch-and-go matter.\r\n\r\nOther developments contributed to the gravity of the situation. Mr.\r\nLloyd George who had been striding up and down the Rubicon, had made a\r\ndismaying discovery. It seemed that there was a place called India.\r\nThe British Foreign Office was also having its troubles. Pilgrimage to\r\nMecca had ceased and Islam was not displaying that gratitude at the\r\npayment of British subsidies to King Hussein of the Hejaz, which Lord\r\nCurzon expected of it. Mr. Lloyd George accordingly ceased striding up\r\nand down the Rubicon and seated himself in a waiting posture on its\r\nbank. On February 26, he told the House of Commons in London that his\r\nstatement of Jan. 5, 1918, respecting Constantinople as the Turkish\r\ncapital, “was specific. It was unqualified and it was very deliberate.\r\nIt was made with the consent of all parties in the community. It was\r\nnot opposed by the Labor Party.” Preparations were accordingly made to\r\nleave Constantinople to the Turk in the peace settlement, and London\r\neditors (who as a rule are not Moslems) began turning over projects\r\nfor the “Vaticanization” of the Caliphate of Islam.\r\n\r\nOn the night of March 15-16, during the temporary absence of his\r\nFrench co-commander, General Milne seized the telegraph offices in\r\nConstantinople, isolated the capital from Asia Minor, executed a\r\nseries of lightning raids at midnight, arrested every Nationalist\r\ndeputy in the Ottoman Parliament whom he could lay his hands on, and\r\nembarked them on transports for internment on Malta. By dawn of the\r\n16th, British forces held the city securely in their grip, Rauf Bey\r\nand many of his colleagues were _en route_ to barbed wire compounds on\r\nMalta, the rest of the Nationalist deputies were clambering up the\r\nAsiatic shore of the Bosphorus to begin their long trek back to\r\nAngora, General Milne was soon to be recognized as the Allied\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and Constantinople was ready to be left to the\r\nTurk.\r\n\r\nOn April 6, the Ali Riza Government gave way to a second Damad Ferid\r\nGovernment. On April 11, Ferid issued a Sultanic edict denouncing\r\nNationalism, and a similar edict was issued by the _Sheikh-ul-Islam_\r\nwho had entered his high office upon the arrest and deportation to\r\nMalta of his predecessor (the German occupation of Belgium during the\r\nwar had left Cardinal Mercier unmolested, but no such nice scruples\r\nhave troubled the British occupants of Constantinople). Meanwhile,\r\nmilitary events were moving rapidly. The Circassian leader, Anzavur,\r\nwho had been launched against the Nationalists, had flickered out\r\nafter a few local successes along the Asiatic shore of the Straits,\r\nand it became evident that serious operations would have to be\r\nundertaken if Constantinople was to be held. Every British man of war\r\nin the Mediterranean was ordered to Constantinople and, with the\r\nsecond Ferid Government launching its religious thunderbolts at the\r\nNationalists, Allied conferences at Hythe and Boulogne called on the\r\nGreeks behind Smyrna to screen the Straits from the “Kemalists.” In\r\nconjunction with British naval units, the towns along the Asiatic\r\nshore of Marmora were quickly occupied. Thrace was given to the Greeks\r\nin Europe to protect the capital from the Nationalists in its rear,\r\nand a British Constantinople was now firmly embedded in a Greek\r\nsetting. The High Contracting Parties were now prepared to “agree that\r\nthe rights and title of the Turkish Government over Constantinople\r\nshall not be affected, and that the said Government and His Majesty\r\nthe Sultan shall be entitled to reside there and to maintain there the\r\ncapital of the Turkish State.”\r\n\r\nOn May 11, the terms of peace were handed to two of Ferid’s appointees\r\nat Paris. These terms proposed to close the Greek pincers about\r\nConstantinople, to cut it off from Asia Minor permanently with a\r\ngarrison restricted to 700 men, to isolate the Straits from Asia Minor\r\nby the institution of an International Commission on which Russia and\r\nTurkey would be represented if and when they became members of the\r\nLeague of Nations, and to place what remained of Turkey in Asia Minor\r\nunder the permanent military, economic and financial control of Great\r\nBritain, France and Italy. As for Smyrna, “the city of Smyrna and the\r\nterritory in Article 66 will be assimilated, in the application of the\r\npresent Treaty, to territory detached from Turkey. The city of Smyrna\r\nand the territory defined in Article 66 remain under Turkish\r\nsovereignty. Turkey however transfers to the Greek Government the\r\nexercise of her rights of sovereignty over the city of Smyrna and the\r\nsaid territory. In witness of such sovereignty the Turkish flag shall\r\nremain permanently hoisted over an outer fort in the town of Smyrna.\r\nThe fort will be designated by the Principal Allied Powers…. The Greek\r\nGovernment may establish a Customs boundary along the frontier line\r\ndefined in Article 66, and may incorporate the city of Smyrna and the\r\nterritory defined in the said Article in the Greek customs system….\r\nWhen a period of five years shall have elapsed after the coming into\r\nforce of the present Treaty the local parliament referred to in\r\nArticle 72 may, by a majority of votes, ask the Council of the League\r\nof Nations for the definitive incorporation in the Kingdom of Greece\r\nof the city of Smyrna and the territory defined in Article 66. The\r\nCouncil may require, as a preliminary, a plebiscite under conditions\r\nwhich it will lay down. In the event of such incorporation as a result\r\nof the application of the foregoing paragraph, the Turkish sovereignty\r\nreferred to in Article 69 shall cease. Turkey hereby renounces in that\r\nevent in favor of Greece all rights and title over the city of Smyrna\r\nand the territory defined in Article 66.” As for Constantinople, it\r\nremained the Turkish capital, but “in the event of Turkey failing to\r\nobserve faithfully the provisions of the present Treaty, or of any\r\ntreaties or conventions supplementary thereto, particularly as regards\r\nthe protection of the rights of racial, religious or linguistic\r\nminorities, the Allied Powers expressly reserve the right to modify\r\nthe above provisions, and Turkey hereby agrees to accept any\r\ndispositions which may be taken in this connection.”\r\n\r\nThere being no Ottoman Parliament in session, Damad Ferid Pasha\r\nsummoned eighty prominent Turks to Yildiz Kiosk to authorize signature\r\nof the peace terms. Permitting no discussion of it, Ferid ordered\r\nthose who favored signature to stand and, scenting trouble ahead, he\r\nwhispered to the Sultan to stand. Considerations of etiquette bade\r\nevery one present stand, but the late “Topdjeh” Riza Pasha broke into\r\nvigorous protest. In a voice trembling with emotion, he told Ferid\r\nthat the meeting had risen out of respect to the _Padishah_ and not in\r\nresignation to the peace terms, that the meeting had no power to\r\nauthorize their signature and that, even if it had, it could not\r\nauthorize their signature as long as Anatolia was in open and armed\r\nrevolt against them. Without further ado, Ferid declared the signature\r\nof the peace terms authorized and added audibly that Anatolia could go\r\nto the devil.\r\n\r\nSo the peace terms were signed by three of Ferid’s appointees (one of\r\nthem a teacher in an American college near Constantinople) on August\r\n11 at Sevres in the suburbs of Paris. Sevres is in Christendom and the\r\nyear was 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nANGORA\r\n\r\nFEVZI, RAFET AND KIAZIM KARABEKR PASHAS AND THEIR MILITARY\r\nDICTATORSHIP UNDER KEMAL PASHA――THE “PONTUS” DEPORTATIONS――MOSUL, THE\r\nKURDS AND THE SPLIT IN ISLAM――THE FRANCO-ARMENIAN FRONT IN CILICIA,\r\nTHE GREEK FRONT BEFORE SMYRNA, AND THE ALLIED FRONT BEFORE\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE――HOW THE BROKEN PARLIAMENT WAS RECONSTRUCTED AT\r\nANGORA――FERID’S COUNTER-REVOLUTION AT KONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAngora lies tilted up on its hill, a gray blanket of flat roofs\r\npierced with white minarets and green cypresses, and scarred across\r\nits middle with the ruins of 1915. At its foot lies a shallow marsh\r\nstretching from the town itself to its railway station, a mile and a\r\nhalf away. Along the rim of the basin up whose southern slope it\r\nsprawls, are the summer villas of its wealthier families, secure above\r\nthe hot-weather malaria of the marsh.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the town lies along its lower fringes. When the Sivas\r\ncongress moved the Nationalist Party’s council to Angora late in\r\nSeptember, 1919, Kemal himself took up his abode in an upper room at\r\nthe railway station and a Decauville locomotive was kept fired up\r\nnight and day beneath his window, in readiness to hurry him farther\r\ninto the interior on an instant’s warning. The first building one\r\npasses upon entering the town from the railway station is the gray\r\ngranite building once used as the local headquarters of the Committee\r\nof Union and Progress, with a wooden theatre lying in the center of a\r\ngarden across the road. Some distance to the left, as one continues\r\ninto the town, is the old _konak_, or Government building, where the\r\nprovincial administration was formerly housed. Across the square in\r\nfront of it, is the Post and Telegraph Office. On the right hand as\r\nthe town is entered, a broad street turns off past the theatre and\r\nleads around the foot of the town to the beautiful compound of the\r\nSultana College. Almost opposite the theatre as one turns into this\r\nroad, is a large school building of stone and some distance farther\r\nalong is the stone building formerly occupied by the local\r\nadministration of the Public Debt. Still farther along, far out in the\r\noutkirts of the town, the blue and white buildings of the Sultana\r\nCollege stand within the walls of their compound. Here Fevzi Pasha, a\r\ntowering Anatolian Turk with drooping moustaches, and Rafet Pasha, a\r\ndapper little figure, were engaged in re-mobilizing and re-equipping\r\nthe Army. Fevzi Pasha is a dour giant of a man with a gargantuan\r\nappetite for work and a complete aversion from social intercourse of\r\nany sort. Rafet Pasha has a similar capacity for work but he combines\r\nwith it a natural genius for social intercourse. I have seen him in a\r\nnumber of widely varying settings, from his quarters in the Sultana\r\nCollege to the mountain passes of Anatolia in the dead of winter, but\r\nhe is invariably as immaculate both in manner and appearance as if he\r\nhad just stepped out of a drawing room.\r\n\r\nUnder Mustapha Kemal Pasha, Fevzi Pasha and Rafet Pasha ruled Anatolia\r\nfor the Nationalists, their authority reaching down into the provinces\r\nthrough military governors whom they assigned to the more critical\r\nprovincial capitals. Kiazim Karabekr Pasha who held the eastern\r\nprovinces from Erzerum, ought to be mentioned with them. It had been\r\neasy enough to take over Anatolia from the Damad Ferid Government, for\r\nthe Greek occupation of Smyrna undermined Ferid’s hold on the country\r\nat a stroke, but to hold Anatolia against Ferid’s efforts to recover\r\nit was quite another matter. Fevzi, Rafet and Kiazim were the men who\r\nheld it, and whatever traditions of personal advantage they inherited\r\nfrom the old Ottoman Government, their personal ambitions were sunk in\r\nthe common cause of defending the remnant of the country. I believe\r\nfirmly that this statement holds true of Kemal as well. My impression\r\nof him is that he would have joined one of his own labor battalions\r\nand dug roads behind his own Army if he thought that by so doing he\r\nwould be able more effectively to contribute to his country’s defense.\r\n\r\nThese men constituted a small handful of modern Westerners in control\r\nof a vast mediaeval Eastern country, but their task was simplified by\r\nthe comparative absence of the Levantinism which had poisoned\r\nConstantinople. Such as their country was, it was as homogeneous as\r\nany between Vienna and Bagdad. There were Turks, Kurds, Circassians,\r\nTurcomans, Tartars and Laz in the country, a few remaining Armenians\r\nin the interior, an increasing number of Greeks between Samsun and\r\nTrebizond along the Black Sea littoral, and a handful of widely\r\nscattered Americans, mostly in the employ of the Near East Relief. The\r\nlarge majority of its population, however, was Turkish and most of the\r\nnon-Turks were bound to the Turks by their acceptance of Islam. The\r\ncountry, while wholly primitive, was far more single-minded than its\r\ncapital had been for a century. Its handful of Americans were soon\r\nrepresented at Angora by two members of the Near East Relief’s corps,\r\nthe late Miss Annie T. Allen and Miss Florence Billings. Most of their\r\ncontact was with Rafet Pasha and, despite the serious delicacy of\r\ntheir position, their relations with Rafet Pasha were generally happy.\r\n\r\nThe military situation in which the Turks found themselves, was\r\nshortly to be simplified by the brief war which Kiazim Karabekr Pasha\r\nlaunched from Erzerum against the Armenian Republic of Erivan. This\r\nopened a line of retreat to Trans-Caucasia and Central Asia, and if\r\nKemal, Fevzi and Rafet Pashas had been forced to drop their archives\r\ninto their _kalpaks_ and flee, a back door would have been available\r\nfor their escape into the East.\r\n\r\nThe Pontus project which the Greeks along the Black Sea littoral had\r\nlaunched, was not so simple to handle. The Greek occupation of Smyrna\r\neventually made it necessary to transfer the Third Army from Amasia to\r\nthe hinterland of Smyrna and the so-called Pontus had to be held with\r\nirregulars under the command of the late Osman Agha, the Laz mayor of\r\nKerasund. The crude terrorism he wielded proved to be such an ugly\r\nbusiness that Hamid Bey, one of the best men available in Angora, was\r\ndispatched to Samsun as mayor. Hamid Bey is a Rhodes Turk with\r\nup-standing hair, Kaiser-like moustaches, a mouth full of gold and a\r\nbooming voice, a combination apt to give one meeting him for the first\r\ntime a sense of having met some new species of wild man, but a further\r\nacquaintance with him reveals beneath his surface eccentricities a\r\ncharacter of solid integrity and ripe judgment. He had been a governor\r\nof provinces and the fact that the post of mayor in Samsun was thought\r\nworthy of being filled by an ex-governor may be taken as an indication\r\nof Rafet Pasha’s anxiety to discover some peaceful solution of the\r\nPontus problem. Osman Agha’s terrorism remained as much of a problem\r\nat Angora as the Greek terrorism which it sought to overcome, but a\r\nsolution was finally discovered for it when Osman, having shot down\r\n900 Greeks and Armenians in Marsovan in reprisal for the knifing of\r\n200 Turks by Greek troops at Ismid, marched to Angora to offer himself\r\nand his Laz followers to the Army. He entered Angora as the hero of a\r\ngoaded and angry population and Kemal, after permitting him to enjoy\r\nhis ovation to the full, incorporated his followers in the Turkish\r\nshock troops with whom they were cut to pieces in the Battle of the\r\nSakaria River. Thereafter there were no more Marsovans in the\r\nso-called Pontus, but the problem of its Greeks still remained.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be no doubt that the Pontus program had reached the\r\nstatus of a definite organization determined on independence, an\r\norganization which was peculiarly difficult to combat by reason of the\r\nfact that any move against it would be disseminated in the Black Books\r\nof the Oecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople as evidence of\r\n“persecution of the Christians.” Believing that one of the\r\norganization’s centers was a body of Greek students which called\r\nitself the Pontus Literary Society in the American college at\r\nMarsovan, Angora requested Dr. George E. White, president of the\r\ncollege, to suppress the Society. Possibly forgetting that the country\r\nwas in a state of war and nowhere more bitterly so than in Marsovan,\r\nDr. White refused to suppress the Society. Angora thereupon suppressed\r\nthe college, deporting its American teaching staff to the coast whence\r\nthey were removed to Constantinople. A number of Greeks were then\r\narrested in Marsovan on evidence which Angora believed indicated their\r\nactivity in the Greek organization; they were removed to Angora,\r\nplaced on trial before a military court under a charge of treason in\r\ntime of war, convicted and hung. But the tumult in the so-called\r\nPontus still continued. Greek and Turkish irregulars burned each\r\nother’s villages and ambushed each other in the fields. This sort of\r\nthing dragged along until 1922, when Angora, having failed to break up\r\nthe Greek organization, deported into the interior the entire Greek\r\npopulation along the Black Sea, men, women and children alike.\r\n\r\nOnce these deportations had been ordered at Angora, their execution\r\nwas of necessity left to the local police chiefs and the manner of\r\ntheir execution varied with the temper of the local police chiefs and\r\nthe amount of supplies available in each province. Both the police\r\nchiefs and the amounts of supplies available varied widely, and the\r\ntreatment of the deportees on the march varied accordingly. The report\r\nwhich Dr. Mark Ward, the Near East Relief worker who was deported from\r\nKharput, made to the British Foreign Office in London as well as to\r\nhis own Government in Washington, indicates that their sufferings at\r\nKharput were heavy. Dr. Ward in his report laid the blame for their\r\nsufferings on Angora. Whether, once other methods had failed to break\r\nup the Greek Pontus organization, Angora possessed the means to make\r\ndeportation a bearable process for the Greeks, is a question which in\r\nthe lack of conclusive evidence must remain unanswered here. It seems\r\nto me more to the point, however, to point out the original guilt of\r\nthose who landed the Greeks in Asia Minor without the means of\r\nprotecting them there. The “Pontus” episode is not the first in which\r\nWestern Powers have permitted the Greeks to expose their own people to\r\ndanger in the hope that their sufferings will attract Western\r\nassistance. There are minorities in every country between Vienna and\r\nBagdad and their exposure to danger constitutes part of the\r\n_technique_ of Balkan statecraft. Greek atrocities at Ismid resulted\r\nin Osman Agha’s reprisals at Marsovan. It is not impossible that that\r\nwas the purpose with which Greek atrocities along the Marmora shore\r\nbegan. Certainly it is difficult to find any other purpose in the\r\nconduct of Greek regular troops. Thus it is that Balkan peoples draw\r\ntheir new frontiers. Thus it has been for a century and thus\r\npresumably it will continue to be, as long as the West permits.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me (and I must add in fairness that my knowledge of the\r\n“Pontus” deportations, while gleaned at Angora and the Oecumenical\r\nPatriarchate alike, is purely second-hand) that it is open to question\r\nwhether Angora’s deportation of Greek women was justified and whether\r\nit made the fullest use of such scanty supplies as it had in caring\r\nfor the deportees on the march. On the other hand, the action of the\r\nBritish in disembarking the Greeks into the “Pontus” without protest\r\nfrom the Oecumenical Patriarchate, could only be justified if the\r\nTurks remained helpless and passive. As soon as Nationalism began to\r\ngather strength in the interior, the most elemental sense of humanity\r\non the part of the British and the Oecumenical Patriarchate should\r\nhave prompted negotiations with Angora looking toward the\r\nre-embarkation of the “Pontus” women and the humane internment of the\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe deportation of the “Pontus” Greeks and Kiazim Karabekr Pasha’s\r\nvictory over the Armenian Republic of Erivan in Trans-Caucasia kept\r\nAngora’s rear open. The British front in the Mosul province of\r\nMesopotamia has never threatened Angora’s rear, for the mountainous\r\nnature of the country ahead of them has made impossible any further\r\nadvance on the part of the British. Here the British have sought to\r\npartition the Kurdish population, leaving its northern half to Angora\r\nand incorporating its southern half in the Arab State of Iraq. Whether\r\nthe chiefs of the Kurdish tribes prefer to be under Turkish rule or\r\nunder Arab rule or independent under the British aegis, is a question\r\nto which Angora and Bagdad furnish widely varying answers. It seems\r\nprobable, however, that Kurdish opinion, such as it is, does not\r\nrelish partition and if there are Kurdish deputies at Angora, it is\r\nbecause the Turks are the only parties to the Mosul controversy who do\r\nnot propose to divide the Kurdish country. There is a wider aspect,\r\nhowever, to the Mosul controversy. Turks and Arabs alike are _Sunni_\r\nMoslems and as long as the British can maintain a controversy over\r\nMosul between the new Turkish State and the Arab State of Iraq, Islam\r\nremains in a divided condition. It is the desire to abstain from any\r\naction over Mosul which might widen that breach, which has prompted\r\nDjavid Pasha, the Turkish commander at Diarbekr, to refrain from the\r\nuse of force in the recovery of Mosul. The _sheikh_ of the Senussi who\r\ngirded the late Caliph on his accession to the Throne in 1918, and who\r\nfled from Brussa to Angora when the Greeks entered Smyrna, has been at\r\nDiarbekr for the last three years, attempting to heal the Turco-Arab\r\nbreach over Mosul. Thus far, the conduct of the Turkish command on the\r\nMosul “front” has been marked by a conspicuous restraint.\r\n\r\nAs Kemal, Fevzi and Rafet Pashas looked toward the West, they were\r\nconfronted by three military fronts, the Cilician front on their left,\r\nthe Greek front behind Smyrna on their center, and the Allied\r\noccupation of Constantinople on their right. In the winter of\r\n1919-’20, the British high command in Cairo withdrew its forces from\r\nCilicia in accordance with the secret Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916,\r\nto Palestine, leaving the French command at Beirut in sole occupation\r\nof the northern end of the Syrian corridor and of Cilicia. Here, under\r\nthe French aegis in Cilicia, an Armenian enclave was being carved out\r\nand the Turkish administration had withdrawn to Bozanti, a town at the\r\ntop of the Taurus Range. The French front extended from the Taurus\r\neast to the Mosul province, but it was in Cilicia that the weight of\r\nthe French occupation made itself chiefly felt. The Armenians revenged\r\nthe undoubted wrongs which they had suffered under the Ottoman Sultans\r\nin drastic fashion and there were streets even in Adana itself in\r\nwhich it was not safe for a Turk to show himself after dark. The\r\nTurkish towns outside the rim of the French area, possibly inflamed by\r\nthe tales of Turkish refugees from Adana, soon launched a guerilla\r\nwarfare against the Franco-Armenian regular troops and began isolating\r\nout-lying garrisons. Much of this was directed by the Turkish\r\nex-administration at Bozanti, but it was carried on largely by Turkish\r\nirregulars with any following which they could impress into service.\r\n\r\nAs for the Greek front behind Smyrna, the first defense which was used\r\nwas that of the Circassian bandit leader, Edhem, but the Greek command\r\nsoon won him over and made a considerable hero of him. This left\r\nKemal, Fevzi and Rafet Pashas without defense and the skeleton Third\r\nArmy which was hastily transferred from Amasia, covering Samsun, to\r\nthe Smyrna front was too depleted in strength to offer effective\r\nresistance. Nuri Ismet Pasha, a slight deaf man but an able pupil of\r\nvon der Goltz and the Potsdam War College, was given command on the\r\nSmyrna front and the hasty extemporization of munition factories began\r\nat Konia in his rear. Until his forces should be built up to an\r\neffective strength, however, he restricted himself to keeping in touch\r\nwith the Greeks, and with all of Asia Minor behind him in which to\r\nmaneuvre, he traded territory for time whenever the Greeks showed an\r\ninclination to move. Luckily for Angora, the Greeks sat waiting on the\r\nAllies and attempted little movement after their first rush ended.\r\n\r\nThus hemmed about with enemies, the Nationalist Party had won a\r\nclean-cut political victory by installing its Parliamentary majority\r\nin Constantinople, and its troops had penetrated into the very suburbs\r\nof the capital in search of surrendered munitions with which to\r\nre-equip themselves. Although the Mudros armistice had been torn up at\r\nthe Greek occupation of Smyrna and a state of war again existed,\r\nAngora was in close telegraphic communication with Rauf Bey, the\r\nleader of its Parliamentary majority in Constantinople. Indeed, with\r\nthe British Navy commanding those sections of its perimeter which were\r\nnot in the occupation of enemy Armies, Angora’s wire to Constantinople\r\nconstituted its only means of communication with the West.\r\n\r\nBut on the night of March 15-16, 1920, General Milne isolated\r\nConstantinople from Anatolia, conducted a series of lightning raids at\r\nmidnight in Stamboul, arrested Rauf Bey and many of his colleagues for\r\ndeportation to Malta, and not only cut off Angora from the legal\r\nParliamentary machinery which it had spent eight months in building\r\nup, but cut it off from any means of effective communication with the\r\nWest. This was a staggering blow. Angora immediately ordered the\r\narrest of the few British officers who remained in Asia Minor, chief\r\namong them Lord Rawlinson’s brother who was jailed at Erzerum, but\r\nwith Rauf Bey and his colleagues on their way to Malta as prisoners of\r\nthe British, the Nationalists lost some of the best brains in the\r\nParty. The Italians soon opened their cable from Adalia to Rhodes\r\nwhence a wireless was in communication with Rome, but Angora’s sole\r\ncontact with the West was even then at the disposal of a foreign\r\nPower.\r\n\r\nWithin the next few weeks, deputies who had escaped General Milne’s\r\nmidnight raids in Stamboul, began filtering into Angora and an attempt\r\nto reconstruct the shattered Parliament began. A month was allowed for\r\nescaped deputies to reach Angora and claim their seats in the new\r\nParliament, and the seats of others who had been interned on Malta\r\nwere awarded in new “elections,” one of which is said to have been\r\nheld in the Asiatic suburbs of Constantinople itself where Italian\r\nforces were in occupation; Italy has never relished the hurried Greek\r\noccupation of Smyrna.\r\n\r\nSo on April 23, 1920, the reconstructed Parliament, with deputies\r\nsitting for constituencies in all the areas covered by the Erzerum\r\nprogram, from Thrace to Mosul, began its session in the old Committee\r\nof Union and Progress building in Angora, under the new name of the\r\nGrand National Assembly of Turkey. Mustapha Kemal Pasha was made\r\nCommander-in-Chief and President, Fevzi Pasha became Chief of the\r\nGeneral Staff and Prime Minister, Rafet Pasha became Minister of War\r\nand Interior, and the deputies acquiesced in the military dictatorship\r\nwhich they found at Angora. Even in the West, democracy does not\r\nthrive in time of war, nor did it in the war-ringed isolation of\r\nAngora. Forty percent requisitions, accompanied by ruinously heavy\r\ntaxation afforded, not enough money to balance the Assembly’s budgets,\r\nbut enough to enable Fevzi and Rafet Pashas to continue re-mobilizing\r\nand re-equipping the Army.\r\n\r\nOn April 6, Damad Ferid Pasha again became _Grand Vizier_ in\r\nConstantinople and began at once a determined effort to regain a\r\nfoothold in Anatolia. Fevzi and Rafet Pashas replied to him with a\r\nseries of so-called Military Courts of Independence, before which any\r\nlate Ottoman subject suspected of anti-Nationalism could be brought,\r\ntried under the Army code for treason in time of war, and if convicted\r\nsummarily hung. In the Nationalist view, the Ottoman Sultanate and the\r\nOttoman Government had alike ceased to exist on the night of March\r\n15-16, 1920, and Damad Ferid Pasha, with the prestige of the Ottoman\r\nCaliphate at his disposal, now added himself to the Western enemies\r\nwho surrounded Angora in a final struggle for the possession of the\r\nnew Turkish State.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were hurriedly flung in front of the Straits, Ismet Pasha\r\nmaking no attempt to oppose them, and from behind them Ferid in\r\nConstantinople appealed to Old Turkish opinion at Konia to uphold the\r\nconservative usages of Islam and denounce the Nationalists. It was an\r\nappeal which had helped to nullify the Young Turkish Revolution in\r\n1908, which had helped to keep the old Empire in the stiff dead grip\r\nof religious usage. It was a very powerful appeal and the Greek\r\ncommand at Smyrna lost no time in re-inforcing it by proclaiming its\r\nsolicitude for the Caliphate of Islam. Moslem and Christian reaction\r\nwere the rocks on which the 1908 Revolution had come to grief and the\r\nGreek command at Smyrna lost no time in dropping them into the channel\r\nwhich the Nationalist Revolution of 1920 would have to thread. Since\r\nGreeks and Armenians were then at war with Turkey, Christian reaction\r\nhad no standing at Angora, but Moslem reaction is a rock which Turkey\r\nis to this day still engaged in passing and will be for some years to\r\ncome. Ferid had no more powerful weapon with which to attack the\r\nNationalist hold on the conservative peasantry of Asia Minor and on\r\nthe dervish _tekkes_ of Konia. The Nationalists could handle their\r\nstrong but docile peasantry, but if the worst came to the worst at\r\nKonia the Nationalists could make it plain that Indian and Algerian\r\nMoslems had fought against the Ottoman Government during the war and\r\nthat in the new Turkish State the needs of the country took precedence\r\nover the letter of Moslem law.\r\n\r\nFrom April 6, 1920, when Damad Ferid Pasha re-entered office in\r\nConstantinople, a Nationalist coastguard was instituted on the\r\nMediterranean opposite Konia in order to oppose any attempt at a\r\nlanding, whether by Ferid’s followers from the capital or by Greeks\r\nengaged in the interesting business of proclaiming their solicitude\r\nfor Islam. Konia itself, a dusty wind-swept provincial capital on the\r\nAnatolian plateau, replete with old Seljukian and pre-Seljukian\r\nmosques, was linked with Angora by a great semi-circle of railway line\r\nwhich bent westward _via_ Eski-Shehr and Afium-Karahissar, and\r\nthrice-a-week trains made the journey in eighteen hours. At the same\r\ntime, this bend of railway line was identical from Eski-Shehr to Afium\r\nwith another bend from Constantinople to Smyrna. With Smyrna and its\r\nhinterland in Greek hands, the Greek command added to its new interest\r\nin Islam a scheme for the revival under Greek auspices of the old\r\nSeljukian Empire with its seat at Konia. The Seljukian program is\r\nanother of the ghosts which became stirred to life when the Ottoman\r\nEmpire went down in 1918 to join the dead.\r\n\r\nFerid’s agents and Greek agents kept slipping through the Greek lines\r\ntoward Konia and moving back and forth under the coasts of Asia Minor\r\nwith their eyes on Konia. In the British view, the Ottoman dynasty had\r\nlost the Caliphate in 1914 when it was used to declare a holy war\r\nagainst the British and their Allies. Events at Mecca had since\r\nchanged the British view, but if the Caliphate were not too serious a\r\nmatter for light speaking, it might be added that in the Nationalist\r\nview the British lost the Caliphate in 1920 when they used it to\r\ndeclare a holy war against the Nationalists. Ferid finally recovered\r\nKonia in the counter-revolution of October, 1920, but Rafet Pasha\r\nhurried 2,000 men down the railway from Angora, occupied Ala-ed-Din\r\nhill in the outskirts of the city and drove out Ferid’s administration\r\nin three days of sharp fighting. Rafet Pasha appointed as military\r\ngovernor of Konia, Ghalib Pasha, a tall white-haired Albanian who had\r\ndefended the Caliphate as Ottoman commander in the Hejaz during the\r\nwar, and the _tchelebi_ of the Mevlevi dervishes whose historic right\r\nit had been to gird each Caliph with the Prophet’s Sword forty days\r\nafter his accession to the Throne, went to Angora as one of Konia’s\r\neight deputies in the Grand National Assembly. So the Seljukian ghost\r\nwas laid and the Caliphate came into the Nationalists’ keeping.\r\n\r\nThe Nationalist hold on the interior of Asia Minor now became\r\nindisputable. The munition factories in the rear of Ismet Pasha’s\r\nslowly growing forces on the Smyrna front, were quickly enlarged and\r\nKonia became a war-center of the first importance in the interior. A\r\nconsiderable number of Armenians who had been returned to Konia after\r\nthe Mudros armistice and who had voluntarily remained in their homes\r\nwhen the British offered to evacuate them at the time of their own\r\nevacuation of the Bagdad Railway, had been compromised anew by the\r\nGreek occupation of Smyrna and were placed under increasing military\r\nsurveillance as the number of Turkish munition factories in the town\r\ngrew. Armenian “indiscretions,” however, finally led to the\r\ndeportation of men of military age farther into the interior, and the\r\nlocking up of their churches in Konia. The juxtaposition of a Turkish\r\nmunition factory and an Armenian church is one which is possibly apt\r\nto produce “indiscretions.” When I was last in Konia, the only\r\nArmenians there were women and children. A number of mosques in the\r\ntown had been taken over for military depots, but no Armenian church\r\nin the town had been so taken over. The churches were locked up but\r\notherwise untouched. The Armenian women in the town were permitted to\r\nreceive no mail from the outside world, for the Nationalist censors\r\nwere supposed to read Turkish and French only, not Armenian. No Turk\r\never learns Armenian, and apparently there was no Armenian in whose\r\nloyalty the Turks had sufficient confidence to enable them to entrust\r\nArmenian mail to him for censorship. The Armenian women were being\r\ntaxed to the point of robbery, and so were their Turkish neighbors.\r\nGhalib Pasha told me that he was treating Turks and Armenians on a\r\nbasis of scrupulous equality, and I believe that he meant precisely\r\nwhat he said. If there were enough men like Ghalib Pasha in Turkey to\r\nfill all the provincial administrations, Turkey would be a model\r\ncountry. But men like Ghalib Pasha are not appointed chiefs of police\r\nin highly delicate places like Konia.\r\n\r\nDamad Ferid Pasha did not cease his efforts to regain a foothold in\r\nAnatolia, after his brief counter-revolution in Konia. With the Greek\r\nadvance in the spring and summer of 1921, his agents renewed their\r\nactivities along the coasts. In Smyrna the Greeks welcomed them and in\r\nMersina, the port of Cilicia, the French and Armenians welcomed them.\r\nTheir work increased with the 1921 Greek offensive, until Nationalist\r\nagents boarded the British steamer _Palatina_ at Adalia, discovered\r\nTopal Osman and four confederates hidden in a cargo hold, and shot\r\nthem down. It was a wholly illegal proceeding but it put an end to\r\nFerid’s efforts to return to Anatolia. Incidentally, it so embarrassed\r\nthe Italians who were occupying Adalia under the secret war-time\r\nagreement of St. Jean de Maurienne, that they evacuated their zone.\r\nTechnically, they had been hostile to the Turks but actually their\r\nhostility was directed to the Greeks in Smyrna. Their departure now\r\nafforded the Nationalists their first access to the Mediterranean, and\r\ntheir first representation in the West was soon at Rome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REAR-ADMIRAL COLBY M.

N.\r\n\r\nUnited States High Commissioner at Constantinople from February, 1919,\r\nto the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States\r\nand Turkey.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nTURKISH NATIONALISM\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN TRADITION OF GOVERNMENT TO WHICH THE GRAND NATIONAL\r\nASSEMBLY WAS BUILT――HOW NATIONALISM WAS CREATED――GREEK DEFEAT AT THE\r\nSAKARIA RIVER――PEACE WITH THE FRENCH IN CILICIA――AMERICAN ARMENIANISM\r\nAND CILICIA――HOW A CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATION WAS BEGUN AT ANGORA WHILE\r\nFEVZI PASHA WAS RE-MOBILIZING AND RE-EQUIPPING THE TURKISH ARMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Grand National Assembly opened its first session on April 23,\r\n1920, in the gray granite building at the foot of Angora, the Crescent\r\nand Star went up on the flag-staff atop the building and, although\r\ntrenches were dug for its military defense if necessary, the Turkish\r\nflag has flown there night and day ever since it was first hoisted. At\r\none corner of the grounds, just outside the trenches which encircle\r\nthe building, a gallows was erected. In a little restaurant near the\r\nAssembly building, I have sat at luncheon with that gallows looking in\r\nthrough the window. I have thought several times as I sat there of a\r\nnumber of worthy Americans at home who might have held less simple\r\nviews on Near and Middle Eastern subjects in days gone by, if they\r\ncould have sat at luncheon in Angora with the cross-beam and pulley of\r\nthat gallows looking in upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly building itself contains a single floor with a corridor\r\ndown its middle, a row of committee rooms on one side and a\r\ncomparatively large chamber on the other. The chamber was equipped for\r\nthe Assembly’s use by the construction of a high desk for “Mr.\r\nSpeaker” in the center of one wall and a lower desk in front of it to\r\nbe used by deputies in addressing the Assembly. Grouped in\r\nsemi-circular fashion around the Speaker’s desk, the small desks to be\r\nused by the deputies themselves were crowded upon the floor of the\r\nchamber in long rows. Half-way up the side walls, small galleries were\r\nbuilt for visitors. The whole equipment was of wood. It looked like a\r\nschool-room. It was a school-room, possibly as bitter a school-room as\r\nany nation has ever attended.\r\n\r\nThe 342 deputies of the Assembly were in large part, and still are,\r\nEasterners engaged in adapting the Western governmental tradition to\r\ntheir own uses, but they have never sold their great Eastern\r\nbirthright for a mess of Western pottage. When they gathered for their\r\nfirst session at 1 o’clock on April 23, 1920, a small motto, done in\r\nTurkish script of white on a blue ground, a quotation from the _Koran_\r\nsuch as may be found in thousands of devout Moslem homes, was hung on\r\nthe wall above the Speaker’s desk. A free translation of it into\r\nEnglish would be: “Let us meet together in council and discuss.” It\r\nwas the ground on which the new force of nationalism was carrying the\r\nconservative peasantry of Anatolia behind the Caliph in Constantinople\r\nto the _Koran_ itself, on which it was wrenching Anatolia away from\r\nthe Sultan and his _Grand Vizier_ while refraining from any violation\r\nof its allegiance to the Ottoman Caliphate.\r\n\r\nBeneath that motto, the deputies met at 1 o’clock every day but\r\nFriday, which is the Moslem Sabbath. They consisted of men in Western\r\ndress and _kalpaks_, officers in the old great-coats of Ottoman Army\r\ndays, and _hojas_ in Eastern robes and turbans. They varied in\r\npersonal appearance from the ample and immaculate figure of\r\nDjelal-ed-Din Arif Bey, deputy for Erzerum, to three Kurdish chiefs\r\nwho could neither read nor write. The din of their conversation, both\r\nwithin the chamber and in the corridor without, was continual and the\r\nintermittent tinkle of the Speaker’s hand-bell did little to abate it,\r\nfor the Assembly at Angora is as noisy as all other Parliaments are.\r\n\r\nThe military dictatorship which Fevzi Pasha and Rafet Pasha wielded\r\nover Anatolia was in the Eastern tradition, but in the institution of\r\nthe Assembly a Western plant began taking root in the Eastern soil of\r\nAnatolia. The military dictatorship would pass with the war but the\r\nAssembly was intended to be permanent and it was fashioned in\r\nreadiness to begin functioning as soon as the war permitted. In its\r\nstructure, the Western tradition was adapted to what were believed to\r\nbe the country’s needs. It was necessarily fashioned to a theory at\r\nfirst, for the number of enemies who ringed it about made a\r\ndictatorship essential. As the war approached its end, as more men and\r\nmore money became available, practice might modify it but with the\r\nloss of the Parliament at Constantinople it afforded the only attempt\r\nat an ultimately civilian administration which the country possessed.\r\n\r\nThis is the theory to which it was built: Under the Ottoman\r\nConstitution, as revived by the 1908 Revolution, the powers of\r\ndeclaring war and peace, of dissolving Parliament, of receiving\r\ndiplomatic representatives of foreign States, and of appointing the\r\nCabinet and the Senate, had been vested in the Sultan. In the creation\r\nof the Grand National Assembly, the Sultan was deposed and his\r\nprerogatives were re-distributed. The Assembly itself became the seat\r\nof authority and since its sessions were fixed by its fundamental law\r\nat two years’ duration, no right of dissolving it was admitted. The\r\npower of receiving diplomatic representatives of foreign States was\r\ndelegated to the President of the Assembly. The power of appointing\r\nthe Cabinet was taken by the Assembly and since its Ministers were\r\nmade individually responsible to the Assembly, both the executive and\r\nthe legislative functions of government were retained in its hands.\r\nThe Senate disappeared with the Sultan and the Government of the Grand\r\nNational Assembly became radically republican in structure.\r\nDifferences of opinion existed in the Nationalist Party respecting its\r\npermanent structure, a small school of monarchist opinion holding that\r\na form of government so unreservedly republican would not show itself\r\nsuited to the country’s peace-time needs, but for the time being\r\ndomestic controversies were buried deeply beneath the urgencies of the\r\nmilitary situation. No differences of opinion have existed among\r\nWesterners who know the East, however. It has long been a belief in\r\nthe West that the East can only be ruled by Sultans. We Westerners may\r\nbe right or we may be wrong in our views of the East, but Turkish\r\nNationalism has thrown us a most direct challenge in the out-and-out\r\nrepublicanism of its Grand National Assembly. When the war ends, we\r\nshall see what we shall see.\r\n\r\nThe Grand National Assembly speedily set about the elaboration of a\r\nfundamental law which may be taken as the Constitution in embryo of\r\nthe new Turkish State. It was finally adopted on June 17, 1920, and\r\nits more important clauses translate from Turkish into English as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“Article I. Sovereignty belongs to the nation without reservation. The\r\nadministration of the nation’s sovereignty is based on the principle\r\nof the direct decision of the people.\r\n\r\n“Article II. The executive power as well as the legislative power are\r\nconcentrated in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey which alone\r\nrepresents the nation.\r\n\r\n“Article III. Turkey is governed by the Grand National Assembly and\r\nits Government is entitled ‘the Government of the Grand National\r\nAssembly.’\r\n\r\n“Article IV. The Grand National Assembly is composed of members\r\nelected by the inhabitants of provinces.\r\n\r\n“Article V. The election of members of the Grand National Assembly\r\ntakes place once in every two years. The duration of membership is two\r\nyears only. Members may be re-elected. The Assembly continues its\r\nsession until the new Assembly is convened. In case it is impossible\r\nto hold new elections, the session of the Assembly may be prolonged\r\nfor one year only. Each member of the Grand National Assembly\r\nrepresents not only his province but is also a representative of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n“Article VI. The general session of the Grand National Assembly takes\r\nplace on the first of November without convocation.\r\n\r\n“Article VII. Fundamental rights such as the enactment dispositions of\r\nthe _Sheriat_ (Moslem law), the making, modification and abrogation of\r\nlaws, the conclusion of conventions and treaties of peace, and the\r\ncall for the defense of the country, belong to the Grand National\r\nAssembly. The making of laws shall be based on principles of\r\njurisprudence which are most closely adapted to the needs of the\r\nnation and to the requirements of its customs and habits. The powers\r\nand duties of the council of mandatory Ministers of the nation shall\r\nbe determined by special laws.\r\n\r\n“Article VIII. The Grand National Assembly administers its\r\ngovernmental departments through mandatory Ministers elected by the\r\nAssembly, according to rules to be provided in a special law. It is\r\nthe Grand National Assembly which instructs the mandatory Ministers in\r\nexecutive matters and if necessary changes the Ministers….\r\n\r\n“Article XI. In local matters, the province has an autonomous\r\npersonality. With the exception of internal and external policy, the\r\n_Sheriat_, justice, military affairs, international economic\r\nrelations, government imposts and inter-provincial matters, the\r\nprovinces are charged with the administration, under laws to be\r\npromulgated by the Grand National Assembly, of the _Evkaf_ (Moslem\r\nreligious endowments), educational institutions, sanitary services,\r\nlocal economics, agriculture, public works and social services….”\r\n\r\nThe remaining articles outline the organization of the provincial and\r\nsub-provincial administrations. In this fundamental law, the\r\nNationalist Revolution of 1920 undertakes to effect the same\r\ndecentralization in administration as the Young Turkish Revolution of\r\n1908 failed to effect. It undertakes infinitely more than that. At a\r\nsingle stroke, it lifts the new Turkish State out of the dead grip of\r\nancient religious usage which strangled the 1908 Revolution, which in\r\nfact made effective revolution of any sort a traditional and hackneyed\r\nimpossibility in the old Ottoman Empire. Whether the new Turkish State\r\nwill succeed in maintaining its new and highly promising freedom from\r\nthe stiff religious traditions which imprisoned the old Empire,\r\nremains to be seen. Christian reaction has been met and defeated on\r\nthe field of battle, but Moslem reaction is still suppressed by the\r\niron hand of the Assembly’s Treason Law. Hidden away in the bitter\r\nloneliness of Anatolia, the Nationalist Party has used drastic methods\r\nin laying the foundations of its Western governmental structure in the\r\nEastern soil of Anatolia. If those foundations have been well and\r\nfirmly laid, we have something new in the East at last.\r\n\r\nWesterners who did not penetrate the thick veil of war which screened\r\nAnatolia from the world during its years of seige, will not find it\r\neasy to realize the suspicion with which it regarded us in the West.\r\nDeceived again and again by Mr. Lloyd George, goaded by repeated Greek\r\natrocities unwittingly reinforced by wild atrocity tales to which the\r\nhospitable American press opened its columns, only a man of Mustapha\r\nKemal Pasha’s iron patience could have compelled his angry countrymen\r\nto persevere in the search for a peaceful escape from the fate which\r\nloomed above them on every frontier. Yet amid the suspicion which\r\npossessed Anatolia during those hard years, the Nationalist Party\r\ncreated a new and very real human force known as nationalism.\r\nPatriotism, love of one’s own soil, is a Western sentiment which would\r\nhave required a generation under normal circumstances for its\r\ntransplantation to the Eastern soil of Anatolia, but under the\r\ncircumstance of a Greek Smyrna, it sprang into existence overnight.\r\nThe Turkish poet, Mehmed Emin Bey, travelling from village to village\r\nin Anatolia with a Turkish officer attached to him, added fuel to the\r\nnew flame of nationalism with his old cry, “_I am a Turk; my race and\r\nlanguage are great._” Newspaper plants, smuggled out from\r\nConstantinople, pieces of press machinery concealed in travellers’\r\nbaggage, handfuls of type dropped into travellers’ pockets, produced\r\nnew dailies and weeklies in Anatolia which poured more fuel on the new\r\nflame. The whole culture of the Turks was moved bit by bit from the\r\nold capital to the new center of the nation’s life. Rafet Pasha’s\r\nMilitary Courts of Independence suppressed any attempt to quench the\r\nnew flame. These Courts were a harsh reminder that there was such a\r\nthing as a distinctive Middle Eastern civilization and that it had\r\ncome to a time when there was no longer any room in Anatolia for\r\nnatives who were not loyal to their own civilization. The old\r\nreligious divisions which had split the Anatolian population swiftly\r\nmelted away in the heat of the new flame. Papa Eftim Effendi gave up\r\nhis community rights and sixty-eight Orthodox churches in the interior\r\nfollowed him into the new Turkish Orthodox Church, agreeing to appoint\r\nno metropolitans except those who could read and write Turkish, who\r\nwere of Ottoman parentage, who had lived at least five years in the\r\ncountry and who had abstained from “political activity.” They agreed\r\nfurthermore that metropolitans accused of secular crimes, instead of\r\nbeing immune from arrest without having first been degraded and then\r\nbeing subject to imprisonment only in the Oecumenical Patriarchate,\r\nwere to be arrested and tried as any other Turkish subject would be.\r\nMoslems permitted a new personage called the Minister of Sacred Law to\r\nbecome an ordinary member of the Cabinet at Angora, and the huge\r\nwealth which was locked up in the country’s Moslem endowments was\r\nopened and placed at the disposition of the provincial administrations.\r\nMoslem courts and schools were taken over by the Ministers of Justice\r\nand Education, respectively. Although American churchmen still thought\r\nin terms of the old Ottoman Empire, still played upon the old\r\nreligious division between Moslems and Christians which had proved the\r\nruin of them both, the new political force of nationalism was blending\r\nthem in Turkey as in Syria, in Palestine and in Egypt. Nationalism is\r\na strangely new and Western force in the East today and thus far\r\nAnatolia has clung to it in the face of every effort which Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge and American churchmen could exert to throw the country back\r\ninto the ruin of its bitter past.\r\n\r\nFor a year after the Greeks landed at Smyrna on May 15, 1919, they sat\r\nin the hinterland of the great port waiting for the Sevres Treaty,\r\nwhile Fevzi Pasha and Rafet Pasha worked like Trojans at Angora. In\r\nMay, 1920, they threw their screen in front of the Straits, Ismet\r\nPasha making no effort to molest them. In November, 1920, Old Greece\r\nfinally rid itself of Mr. Venizelos, a wedge was driven between Athens\r\nand the Phanar, and the French made Constantine an excuse for\r\ndisentangling themselves from the Greeks. Royalist officers now took\r\nover the front behind Smyrna with no respect for the Allied veto on a\r\ndrive toward Eski-Shehr and Afium-Karahissar. With these two railway\r\njunctions occupied, the Greeks would possess the great semi-circle of\r\nrailway which runs from Constantinople to Smyrna, and the Turks would\r\nbe deprived of the interior Angora-Konia line with which they were\r\nsecretly re-mobilizing and re-equipping their Armies on the Smyrna\r\nfront. Accordingly in January, 1921, the Royalist Greek command tried\r\nits strength from Brussa toward Eski-Shehr and retired without\r\nencountering Turkish opposition. The situation was now plain.\r\nEski-Shehr and Afium were theirs whenever they cared to take them. As\r\nfor Fevzi Pasha and Rafet Pasha at Angora, they had imposed a strict\r\nembargo on travellers into the interior of Anatolia and the secrecy\r\nthey succeeded in preserving was one of their striking successes.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, in March, 1921, the Royalist Greek command launched\r\nits double advance, the Southern Army moving on Afium from Ushak, the\r\nNorthern Army on Eski-Shehr from Brussa. To their surprise, both\r\nadvances encountered organized Turkish forces of considerable\r\nstrength. The Southern Army, against stiff opposition, succeeded in\r\noccupying Afium but the Northern Army, following the route it had\r\nwalked over in January, ran into a murderous battle at Inë-Onü and had\r\nto fall back to its old position at Brussa, the Southern Army falling\r\nback from Afium to Ushak with it. That battle was the first meeting of\r\nGreek and Turkish troops in Asia Minor and is today one of the epics\r\nof the new Turkey.\r\n\r\nInë-Onü was the first evidence the Greeks had of what Fevzi Pasha and\r\nRafet Pasha had been doing at Angora, and Athens began feverishly to\r\nincrease its forces in order to administer a “knockout” before Ismet\r\nPasha’s command should be built up into a regular Army. Athens was\r\nready by July and three Armies, starting from the southern, center and\r\nnorthern fronts, were ordered to converge on Kutahia, about half-way\r\nbetween Eski-Shehr and Afium. The operations developed according to\r\nplan, Kutahia fell, Eski-Shehr was evacuated under the threat of\r\nencirclement and, although Ismet Pasha pounded at the exhausted Greeks\r\nin Eski-Shehr for ten days, the Greeks held and Ismet Pasha withdrew\r\nto the Sakaria River, covering Angora itself. The Greek command had\r\nwon the railway junctions of Eski-Shehr and Afium and now possessed\r\nthe bend of railway line which connects Constantinople and Smyrna. The\r\nTurkish command had lost its interior railway line and the only\r\nconnection between Angora and Konia was now a carriage road over which\r\nthe two towns were five days apart.\r\n\r\nStill lured by the possibility of a “knockout,” the Greek command now\r\nrested for a month and then resumed its march. Toward the end of\r\nAugust, it re-established contact with the Turks on the Sakaria River,\r\nwhere Field Marshal Mustapha Kemal Pasha had taken command in person.\r\nAt Angora the civil Government had made preparations for evacuation to\r\nCaesarea, crowds of refugees had thronged the already overcrowded\r\ntown, and occupants of larger dwellings were dispossessed to make room\r\nfor military hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of the Sakaria River which ensued, was another Inë-Onü but\r\non a larger scale. It lasted three weeks and even Kemal Pasha himself\r\nwas wounded in the course of it, although the only announcement which\r\nwas made of his injury in Angora was a brief _communique_ to the\r\neffect that he had “fallen from his horse.” Attempting to encircle the\r\nTurkish left, the Greek command drove south across an area of desert\r\nbut Kemal pulled down his forces to meet them. The Greeks drove inland\r\nforty miles in a vain endeavor to find the Turkish left, and finally\r\nchanging their plan of battle, threw themselves against the Turkish\r\nlines in a straight frontal engagement, some of the Greek attacks\r\ndriving all the way through and then being held up by the failure of\r\nflanking regiments to follow them. Heavy Turkish counter-attacks\r\nfinally made it plain that the Greek command had underestimated the\r\nTurkish strength and that the long Greek lines of communication\r\nexposed it to the risk of a disorderly retreat. By the middle of\r\nSeptember, the Greek command began pulling back its forces, burning\r\nTurkish villages as they went. By the first of October, the Greeks\r\nwere back in their old positions covering the railway junctions at\r\nEski-Shehr and Afium and the Turkish recovery of Smyrna became only a\r\nmatter of time. By the end of October, the late Miss Annie T. Allen\r\nand Miss Florence Billings, the Near East Relief’s representatives in\r\nAngora, compiled a report on the state of the Turkish villages which\r\nthe Greeks had burned during their retreat and forwarded it to the\r\nNear East Relief’s headquarters in Constantinople. But the Near East\r\nRelief has never published that report, just as Mr. Lloyd George never\r\npublished the Bristol report on Greek misdeeds at Smyrna.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish victory on the banks of the Sakaria radically changed the\r\npolitical complexion of the Near and Middle East. For 200 years, the\r\nWest had been breaking down the old Ottoman Empire, but on the Sakaria\r\nRiver it encountered the Turk himself and when it touched the Turk the\r\ntide of history turned. History will one day find in this obscure\r\nengagement on the Sakaria one of the decisive battles of our era.\r\n\r\nThe French Foreign Office which had been waiting on the outer rim of\r\nevents ever since the Mudros armistice deprived the French Army of its\r\nanticipated sole command in Constantinople, now dispatched M. Henry\r\nFranklin-Bouillon to Angora, where he negotiated the Franco-Turkish\r\npeace agreement of October 20, 1921. Although the covering letter from\r\nYusuf Kemal Bey, Foreign Minister of the Turkish Government, contains\r\nthe only reference to “economic preference” which marked the result of\r\nthe Franklin-Bouillon negotiations, the French Foreign Office probably\r\nhoped in this agreement not only to put an end to the expensive state\r\nof war which the French command at Beirut was facing in Cilicia, but\r\nalso to salvage the Perier railway concession which had been the\r\nsubject of French negotiations with the old Ottoman Government in\r\n1914. A French loan of £22,000,000 had been offered the old Government\r\nin February of that year of which £16,000,000 was paid in the\r\nfollowing April, the French Perier group taking in return a concession\r\nfor 1,800 miles of railway line in northern and eastern Anatolia. The\r\nloan, however, had never been completed, the concession had never been\r\nratified by the old Parliament and it seems quite probable that, even\r\nif it had been, the war would have cancelled it. But peace in Cilicia\r\nhad become an urgent necessity, for the Turkish forces were slowly\r\npushing the Franco-Armenian Armies back toward the sea. To secure\r\npeace, as well as any other objectives which M. Franklin-Bouillon may\r\nhave had in mind, the French Foreign Office surrendered to Turkey a\r\nlong strip of territory, beginning with Cilicia and running east to\r\nthe Mosul province, a French company, however, maintaining the right\r\nof operating the Bagdad Railway from the port of Mersina in Cilicia to\r\nits eastern terminus on the flatlands of Upper Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\nNews of this surrender so embittered the French Army that General\r\nDufieux, the French commandant in Cilicia, left Adana immediately for\r\nBeirut, leaving behind him only subordinate French officers to carry\r\nout the evacuation. It threw the Armenians in Cilicia into a panic. In\r\npreparing their independent Armenian State under the French aegis,\r\nthey had taken a drastic revenge on the Turks in Cilicia and there was\r\ndoubtless ample ground for their fears that the Turks would continue\r\nthe ugly business. In order to assuage their fears, the Turkish\r\nGovernment proclaimed a blanket amnesty, exempted them from military\r\nservice which it had a legal right to claim from them, exempted them\r\nfrom the forty percent requisitions which it exacted from all other\r\nTurkish subjects in the country, and guaranteed their security in the\r\nstrongest terms it could use. To back up these guarantees, it\r\ndispatched two of the best men it had available, Muheddin Pasha as\r\nmilitary governor of the re-occupied territory and Hamid Bey, who has\r\nbeen mentioned above in connection with Samsun, as political officer.\r\nMuheddin Pasha is a representative of the finest type of old Ottoman\r\nArmy officer. He was one of Mustapha Kemal Pasha’s teachers in the War\r\nAcademy at Constantinople and he has been introduced by Kemal Pasha as\r\n“the man who gave us all our ideas of liberty.” He had nothing to do\r\nwith the Armenian deportations of 1915 or with the Enver Government\r\nwhich ordered them; under the Hamidian _regime_, he had been exiled\r\nfour times and twice condemned to death, and during the war he served\r\nas Ottoman commander in the Yemen which was about as far from the\r\ncapital as Enver Pasha could have sent him.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish re-occupation was timed to begin Dec. 1, 1921, and to be\r\ncompleted by Jan. 4, 1922. On November 20, Muheddin Pasha and Hamid\r\nBey published a proclamation in the Turkish newspaper, _Yeni Adana_,\r\nwhich was designed to assuage the Armenians’ fears. On November 22,\r\nthey met a deputation of Armenian leaders in an upper room of the\r\nYenidje railway station, and M. Franklin-Bouillon reached Yenidje\r\nlater in the day from Angora to repeat their re-assurances. On\r\nNovember 26, they motored to Mersina where some 40,000 Armenians were\r\nwaiting for ships and met a deputation of 100 Armenian notables in the\r\nGovernment building. On November 29, M. Franklin-Bouillon returned to\r\nMersina alone and held a final conference with the Armenians. Since\r\nthey had once been Ottoman subjects, the Turkish Government had a\r\nprobable right in law to forbid their departure from Turkish soil, but\r\nit had become clear that no guarantees it could offer would persuade\r\nthem to remain voluntarily and the Government refrained from keeping\r\nthem involuntarily. Most of them went to Syria to live on the charity\r\nof the Near East Relief at Alexandretta, only a few miles away, and\r\ntheir abandoned homes in Cilicia were put into the hands of a Turkish\r\ncommittee appointed by Hamid Bey to be kept for them for a year’s\r\ntime. Most of Cilicia was in a devastated condition and there was an\r\nappalling amount of work to be done in repairing the ravages of war,\r\nbut the bulk of the Armenians settled down to live in idleness on\r\nAmerican charity at the old Alexandretta barracks.\r\n\r\nIt may be that some means will yet be discovered of re-writing ten\r\ncenturies of history in the eastern provinces and five centuries in\r\nCilicia; it may be that some way will yet be opened of transferring\r\nthe semi-autonomy of the old _Ermeni_ community from a religious to a\r\nterritorial basis, but with all possible good will, the discovery of\r\nit or of the faintest possibility of it has proven beyond the feeble\r\npowers of the present writer. If the Armenian problem had ever been\r\nreally understood in the United States, certainly no sane American\r\nwould ever have meddled with it. The past, however, is beyond recall.\r\nIn the tragic position to which the Armenians have been reduced today,\r\nthree courses suggest themselves as being open to Americans in the\r\nfuture:\r\n\r\nFirst, Congress may declare war on Turkey and by dispatching an\r\nexpeditionary force of a strength of possibly 200,000 men, we may\r\nconquer Cilicia and install an Armenian State which will stand as long\r\nas our Army or some other Western Army remains in occupation and no\r\nlonger; and by so doing, we shall succeed in righting one wrong by\r\ncommitting a greater wrong. Happily, this course is out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nSecond, we may continue to support the Armenians with charity and to\r\ninsist upon “minority rights” in Turkey as distinct from the rights of\r\nTurkey’s majorities. This course we have followed consistently since\r\n1918, and it has only succeeded in stiffening the Turks, pauperizing\r\nthe Armenians, and preventing that peace which is the very first\r\nessential of both.\r\n\r\nThird, we may permit the Armenians to work out their future alone.\r\nThis is the course which thoughtful Armenians in Turkey now desire us\r\nto adopt, and its principal remaining opponents are certain Armenians\r\nwho live in New York and are frightfully far from reality. If we adopt\r\nthis course for the future, it seems quite possible that those\r\nArmenians who prefer to live in their own country will in time find\r\ntheir way into Soviet Armenia and those who remain in Turkey will be\r\ngiven equal rights and equal duties with the Turks themselves. Turks\r\nand Armenians understand each other well. Until fifty years ago, they\r\nhad lived together on generally peaceful terms for several centuries\r\nand the fact (to come no nearer home) that Czarist Russia has\r\ndisappeared, seems to promise the possibility of an eventual\r\nresumption in the new Turkish State of that peace which once\r\ncharacterized their relationship….\r\n\r\nThe French evacuation of Cilicia cleared the Turkish left, but the\r\nGreeks on the Eski-Shehr-Afium line still confronted the Turkish\r\ncenter and the Allies in Constantinople still confronted the Turkish\r\nright. Meanwhile, the British command in the capital executed in a\r\nlesser degree the same climb-down as the French had made with respect\r\nto Angora. As a result of the Turkish victory on the Sakaria River,\r\nthe Turkish deportees on Malta were exchanged at Ineboli on the Black\r\nSea coast for British prisoners held in Anatolia. So Rauf Bey came\r\nback to Angora.\r\n\r\nNo Turk has been a greater lover of the British than Rauf Bey (Rauf is\r\nof Circassian and Albanian blood, but politically he is a Turk and\r\nunlike most Turks his foreign language is English instead of French).\r\nHe had applied to the British Embassy in 1914 for help in keeping his\r\ncountry neutral, but no reply had been given him. He had applied to\r\nAdmiral Calthorpe in 1918 for an armistice, but that armistice led to\r\nthe Allied occupation of Constantinople and the Greek occupation of\r\nSmyrna. He had acted in good faith upon an intimation from General\r\nMilne in 1920 and had brought the Nationalist deputies from Angora to\r\nConstantinople, but that action landed him behind British barbed wire\r\non Malta. Is it a matter of wonder that the great tradition which\r\ngenerations of Englishmen had built up in Constantinople, has now\r\ndisappeared? No Turk has fought harder for the British than Rauf Bey,\r\nand few countries have ever more consistently wounded their own\r\nfriends in Turkey than the England over which Mr. Lloyd George\r\npresided. Rauf Bey’s tragic experience at the hands of their country\r\nis one which Englishmen might do well to ponder during these new days,\r\nwhen Turkish tugs are piloting British merchantmen into the Gulf of\r\nSmyrna.\r\n\r\nAli Fethy Bey, a mild, almost shy, Macedonian Turk whose modest\r\nbearing gives no hint of the strength he has contributed to Angora,\r\nreturned with Rauf and a long list of other deputies in the late\r\nParliament at Constantinople. Here were the civilian brains of which\r\nAngora stood in the greatest need and it now became possible for the\r\nGrand National Assembly to begin the erection of a civilian\r\nadministration. Winter was coming on and the military situation would\r\nnecessarily remain at a stand-still. The Assembly gave its War Office\r\n(the Ministry of National Defense is its official title) an immediate\r\nshake-up. Rafet Pasha fell and the Ministry of the Interior was\r\nseparated out and given to Ali Fethy Bey. Here he encountered the same\r\ndifficulty as so many of the Nationalist leaders encountered――he knew\r\nnothing of Anatolia and it required most of the winter merely to learn\r\nthe ins and outs of his department. Rauf Bey was given the Ministry of\r\nPublic Works but in a re-shuffle of the Cabinet, he presently\r\ndisplaced Fevzi Pasha as Prime Minister, a position more nearly\r\ncommensurate with his very high abilities. The Ministry of Finance was\r\nelevated to an actual, as distinct from a figurehead, authority and\r\nthe Near East Relief’s representatives who had been accustomed to\r\nconsulting Rafet Pasha on matters of mutual interest, now found\r\nthemselves referred to Hassan Tahsin Bey, Minister of Finance, when\r\nthey desired to obtain exemption of relief supplies from the payment\r\nof customs duties. Rafet Pasha had been accustomed to pass on their\r\napplications as if they were personal matters, but Tahsin Bey was a\r\nstranger. With the _regime_ of the Capitulations ended, Americans were\r\nfinding themselves in a position in which it became necessary to treat\r\na Government official in Turkey as though he were a Government\r\nofficial. For some Americans, the change has proven, and is still\r\nproving, a difficult one.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Foreign Office which had been housed in the old\r\nPublic Debt building, had signed a treaty of mutual recognition with\r\nSoviet Russia on March 16, 1921, at the same time as a similar\r\nRusso-Persian treaty was being signed. In the Russo-Turkish treaty,\r\nfull Russian recognition was given to the Erzerum program, including\r\nthat clause of it respecting Constantinople and the Straits. No more\r\nvivid illustration exists of the meaning of the Russian Revolution\r\nthan the contrast between the Russo-Turkish Treaty of 1921 and the\r\nAnglo-Russian Treaty of 1907.\r\n\r\nThe application of the provisions of the 1921 Treaty to the new\r\nRusso-Turkish frontier in the Kars Treaty which was signed Oct. 13,\r\n1921, brought about peace in the eastern provinces, and Azerbaijan and\r\nAfghan Ministers, accredited to Mustapha Kemal Pasha, were received in\r\nAngora. A Russian Ambassador was also received and the elaboration of\r\nconsular and commercial treaties was begun.\r\n\r\nOnly three sections of the frontiers of the Turkish State now remained\r\nto be fixed――the Mosul frontier, the Smyrna frontier and the frontier\r\nin Europe. Communication with the West, with a view to the peaceful\r\nsettlement of these disputed frontiers, was now open to Constantinople\r\ndirect, the British command having opened the wire from the General\r\nPost-Office in Stamboul to “the interior” at the same time as it\r\nreturned the deportees from Malta. The carriage road from Adabazar\r\nwhich was available by rail from Constantinople, on past the Greek\r\nleft to Angora was also thrown open, but Greek and Circassian brigands\r\nraided it so frequently that its use was impossible without a strong\r\nguard. Access to Angora was in practice still confined to the railway\r\nfrom Mersina to Konia and thence by carriage to Angora, or up from the\r\nBlack Sea coast through the mountains to Angora. Admission to the\r\ninterior, however, was rarely granted by the Turkish Government’s new\r\nrepresentative in Stamboul, for the Greeks were still dug in before\r\nEski-Shehr and Afium-Karahissar and the war was still on.\r\n\r\nConditions in Anatolia greatly improved during the winter of 1921-’22.\r\nThe beginnings of a civilian administration appeared, but the military\r\nsituation necessarily continued to dominate. Fevzi Pasha continued to\r\nsnap up munitions wherever he could get them. Some came from the\r\nItalians, some came from the French (it is not impossible that the\r\nAmerican uniforms in which some of the Turkish soldiers have been\r\nclad, were originally left as American surplus stocks in France), and\r\nsome came from the British, for the British Commander-in-Chief and the\r\nBritish High Commissioner in Constantinople were in as happy accord on\r\nthe subject of the Greeks as the British War Office and the British\r\nForeign Office have been on a number of other Eastern subjects. In the\r\nmain, however, the Turkish forces were re-mobilized and re-equipped by\r\nthe native resourcefulness of the Turk himself, as personified in the\r\ndour towering figure of Fevzi Pasha. Even after he had secured foreign\r\nammunition, after gangs of peasant women had trekked it up from the\r\ncoasts in ox-carts and on the backs of mules and camels, machinery had\r\nto be scraped together to change the _calibre_ of much of it before it\r\nwould fit his guns. There is hardly a more remarkable story in modern\r\nmilitary history than the story of how Fevzi Pasha re-mobilized and\r\nre-equipped the Turkish forces out of left-over lots of dismantled\r\nartillery and misfit ammunition. The cost of those forces to Anatolia\r\nin its impoverished condition has been appalling, but their creation\r\nby Fevzi Pasha under the conditions of siege which prevailed, has been\r\nno less than miraculous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nSMYRNA, 1922\r\n\r\nALLIED EFFORTS TO HITCH THE SEVRES TREATY TO TURKISH NATIONALISM――GREEKS\r\nTRANSFER TROOPS FROM SMYRNA TO EASTERN THRACE FOR A MOVE ON\r\nCONSTANTINOPLE AND WHEN FETHY BEY IS REFUSED A HEARING IN LONDON,\r\nFEVZI PASHA LAUNCHES HIS ATTACK――THE TURKISH RECOVERY OF SMYRNA――MR.\r\nLLOYD GEORGE RESIGNS AND THE OTTOMAN SULTAN FLEES――LAUSANNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the winter of 1921-’22, the Angora scene was a busy one. In\r\nthe little restaurant near the Assembly building, Cabinet Ministers,\r\ndeputies and Army officers crowded the pine tables at the luncheon\r\nhour, glancing up from their small talk as the unpainted pine door\r\nopened to admit others of their number. The Bokhara Mission would be\r\nin tomorrow. Somebody had been newly named for the Mission to Kabul.\r\nThe Minister of the Interior was to make an important statement to the\r\nAssembly shortly. From far away the staccato _rat-tat_ of machine-gun\r\npractice knocked faintly at the ear without occasioning any more\r\ninterruption than the squeak of the passing ox-carts outside. But the\r\nsmall talk paused in its flow when two young gentlemen of the\r\nAzerbaijan Legation entered and joined three young ladies of the\r\nRussian Embassy in a cigarette at their corner table. The small talk\r\nrecovered slowly. So-and-so Bey, newly arrived from the Ritz in Paris,\r\nentered with the announcement that he had been unable to find a room\r\nin the town and had had to borrow a soldier and a bucket of whitewash\r\nto build himself a house. Could we come up to the housewarming\r\ntomorrow night? We could. For somebody else with whom we had promised\r\nto dine had had to cancel the invitation on further reflection, the\r\nwind being in the wrong direction and his stove smoking in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nOutside the restaurant, the falling snow etched its white tracery\r\nacross the street panorama of Angora. Peasant women in red ragged\r\npantaloons, turbaned _hojas_ robed in more somber colors, smart\r\nTurkish officers in the old great-coats of Ottoman days, Turkish\r\nsoldiers in somebody’s cast-off khaki, Government officials in\r\n_kalpaks_ and European dress, a Turkish policeman in the old Ottoman\r\nbrilliance of red cuffs and brass buttons, six white-robed male nurses\r\nfrom a Red Crescent hospital bearing on their shoulders a heavy\r\ncovered stretcher on its way to an empty grave outside the town――these\r\ncame and went through the veil of snow. Groups of men, sitting at\r\ntheir coffee around glowing braziers in front of the cafes, lifted\r\ntheir faces from the Constantinople papers at the approaching music of\r\na military band (true, the Constantinople papers were ten days old by\r\nthe time they reached Angora, but many of these men had left their\r\nhomes and families in Constantinople, and all they possessed in the\r\nworld was hidden somewhere in the old capital, awaiting their return).\r\nOut of a narrow sidestreet the band moved into sight with a withered\r\nlittle mad woman dancing in her rags beside it. She was fairly well\r\nknown in Angora. They said that her father and two brothers had been\r\nkilled in the Balkan Wars, her husband and three sons had been killed\r\nin the Great War, and her youngest son had been killed at Inë-Onü. But\r\nhowever these things might have been, she was dancing down the street\r\nbeside the heavy-shod bandsmen, dancing as lightly as the snowflakes\r\nto the crashing rhythms of the Mustapha Kemal Pasha March.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the band came the tramping shuffle of a long column of\r\nsoldiers, stolid men, heavily accoutred, with khaki _kalpaks_, their\r\nrifles tipped with new bayonets. They marched away down the broad road\r\nwhich led past the Assembly building to the railway station, a wooden\r\nbuilding with the single word “Angora” in Turkish and English script\r\non its sign-board. A low pall of woodsmoke, belched from the stacks of\r\nhalf a dozen locomotives, hung over the railway yard. A long column of\r\nox-carts was discharging its cargo of new rope-handled wooden boxes\r\ninto freight cars. With the band playing, the column of soldiers broke\r\nranks and scrambled up into another freight train alongside the\r\nstation platform. They entrained within a half-hour, a rattle of\r\ncouplings ran along the length of the train, and it moved out of the\r\nstation toward the west, where the Greeks were still dug in before\r\nEski-Shehr and Afium-Karahissar….\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 21, 1921, the Allied Governments had received delegations from\r\nAthens, Constantinople and Angora in London in an effort to reconcile\r\nthe Treaty of Sevres and the new force of Turkish nationalism. The\r\nAngora delegates were received as technically members of the\r\nConstantinople delegation, but the latter delegated its leadership to\r\nBekr Sami Bey, a huge sloping Circassian who was Foreign Minister at\r\nAngora. Bekr Sami Bey belongs to a type of leadership which is one of\r\nTurkey’s peculiar assets, a type which has enjoyed a long and rich\r\nexperience in diplomacy and which as a result has developed a genius\r\nfor stripping away non-essentials and holding fast to essentials.\r\nThere is an old and true saying to the effect that what an Englishman\r\nis at sea, what a Frenchman is on land, a Turk is in diplomacy. It is\r\na statement which closely characterizes men of the type of Bekr Sami\r\nBey.\r\n\r\nThe Allied Governments offered to institute an international\r\ncommission for the investigation of population statistics in Eastern\r\nThrace and Smyrna, on condition that Turkey and Greece accepted its\r\nfindings and that the remainder of the Sevres Treaty stood unaltered.\r\nBekr Sami Bey accepted the offer, subject to certain conditions in the\r\nconduct of the investigation and certain reservations as to the\r\nremainder of the Sevres Treaty. The Greek delegation would accept no\r\nalteration in the Sevres Treaty of any sort.\r\n\r\nOn March 12, the Allied Governments proposed a series of modifications\r\nin the Sevres Treaty, undertaking _inter alia_ that “the region called\r\nthe _Vilayet_ of Smyrna would remain under Turkish sovereignty and a\r\nGreek force would remain in Smyrna town, but in the rest of the\r\n_sanjak_ order would be maintained by a _gendarmerie_ with Allied\r\nofficers and recruited in proportion to the numbers and distribution\r\nof the population as reported by an Inter-Allied Commission. The same\r\nproportional arrangement, equally according to the report of the\r\nCommission, would apply to the administration. A Christian governor\r\nwould be appointed by the League of Nations and assisted by an\r\nelective assembly and an elective council. The governor would be\r\nresponsible for payments to the Turkish Government of annual sums\r\nexpanding with the prosperity of the province. This arrangement would\r\nin five years be open to review on the demand of either party by the\r\nLeague of Nations.” This pleased neither Greeks nor Turks and the 1921\r\nGreek offensive put a speedy end to its consideration.\r\n\r\nOn June 21, the Allied Governments offered Greece their intervention,\r\nbut the Royalist command behind Smyrna was preparing to resume its\r\nmarch toward Angora and intervention was refused.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1922, the Allied Governments summoned delegations from\r\nAthens, Constantinople and Angora, the Angora delegation headed by\r\nYusuf Kemal Bey who had succeeded Bekr Sami Bey as Foreign Minister.\r\nOn March 22, an Allied proposal for an armistice in Asia Minor was\r\nforwarded to Athens and Angora, and was followed on March 26 by an\r\nAllied Note making further modifications in the Sevres Treaty and\r\nproposing “the peaceful evacuation of Asia Minor by the Greek forces\r\nand the restitution of Turkish sovereignty over the whole of that\r\nregion” within a period of four months after the armistice. The Greek\r\nGovernment accepted the proposal, but Yusuf Kemal Bey on April 7\r\nstipulated that in his Government’s view an armistice could only be\r\nagreed to after the Greek evacuation. The Allied Governments replied\r\non April 15 that the period of the Greek evacuation would be shortened\r\nbut that it was conditional on a prior armistice. On April 22, Yusuf\r\nKemal Bey offered to meet Allied delegates at Ismid in an effort to\r\nexplore further peace conditions which the acceptance of the armistice\r\nproposal would impose on his Government, conditions which had been\r\nleft “open to discussion” in the Allied Note of April 15. The Ismid\r\nproposal came to nothing and in June, Ali Fethy Bey, Minister of the\r\nInterior at Angora, was dispatched to Paris and London with the object\r\nof discovering the nature of the peace conditions which had not yet\r\nbeen defined by the Allies and effecting an agreement if possible.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, the Royalist Greek command transferred 20,000 Old Greek\r\ntroops from its lines behind Smyrna to the Chatalja lines in Eastern\r\nThrace for a move on Constantinople itself, a move which the Allied\r\nGovernments vetoed. It replaced them behind Smyrna with raw Anatolian\r\nGreek levies and on July 30, “autonomy under the guarantee of the\r\nGreek Army” was proclaimed upon “Ionia.” This radically changed the\r\nmilitary situation, but Fevzi Pasha who was now ready at Angora, was\r\nordered by his Government to withhold action pending news from Fethy\r\nBey. In Paris, Fethy Bey had been well received but when he crossed to\r\nLondon late in July, Lord Curzon’s engagement with him was cancelled\r\nand it was only after protests were made on his behalf that Sir\r\nWilliam Tyrrell of the Foreign Office received him. Sir William,\r\nhowever, was not empowered to discuss terms of peace and on August 11,\r\nFethy Bey left London for Rome, stopping in Paris long enough to wire\r\nthe news of his reception in London to Angora. The solution of the\r\nSmyrna deadlock was now committed to Fevzi Pasha.\r\n\r\nAt dawn on August 26, Ismet Pasha attacked the Greek position before\r\nAfium-Karahissar. The secrecy which had marked the re-mobilization and\r\nre-equipment of the Turkish Armies throughout, had been maintained to\r\nthe last and Ismet Pasha found the Greeks wholly unprepared. They\r\nabandoned Afium and Kutahia and endeavored to stand on September 1\r\nbefore Ushak, but on September 2, Turkish cavalry drove into Ushak\r\nthrough and over the Greeks, swept up General Tricoupis and his entire\r\nstaff, and escaped to their own lines. The rest was easy. The distance\r\nfrom Ushak to Smyrna is 160 miles, but the Greeks covered it in eight\r\ndays, abandoning everything but their rifles, living off the country\r\nand stopping only long enough to wreak their last revenge on the\r\nvillages through which they fled. On September 5, they began streaming\r\ninto Smyrna and nothing speaks more highly of Fevzi Pasha’s staff work\r\nthan the fact that all branches of his Army succeeded in keeping pace\r\nwith them. On September 9, advance Turkish units entered Smyrna.\r\nMeanwhile, a secondary attack in the north had been launched against\r\nBiledjik on August 30, the Greeks evacuated Eski-Shehr on September 2\r\nand by September 12, their stragglers were crossing from Mudania and\r\nPanderma to Eastern Thrace.\r\n\r\nFrom the back hills of Java to the country towns of the United States,\r\nthe Turkish re-occupation of Smyrna shook the world. Islam which had\r\nbeen staggered by the Greek occupation in 1919, threw itself into\r\nrejoicing with “our brother Turk.” Christendom which had passed over\r\nthe Greek occupation in silence, was as staggered by the Turkish\r\nre-occupation as if one of the Commandments had dropped out of the\r\nDecalogue. Of the three elements which were present in Smyrna,\r\nArmenians, Greeks and Turks (to mention them in alphabetical order),\r\nAmerican churchmen assumed that it was the Turks who started the fire\r\nwhich razed part of Smyrna town within a week after the re-occupation.\r\nAs for the Turks themselves, budding Turkish linguists greeted the\r\nnews from Smyrna with shouts of “Finish _imperialisme_!”\r\n\r\nOnly the Allied occupation of Constantinople and the Straits, and the\r\nGreek occupation of Eastern Thrace in the Allied rear, now confronted\r\nFevzi Pasha. On September 16, Mr. Lloyd George issued his call to the\r\nBritish Dominions to rally to the defense of “the freedom of the\r\nStraits.” Doubtless Mr. Lloyd George knew what he meant by the phrase,\r\nbut while Soviet Russia and Turkey had repeatedly and publicly defined\r\nit, Mr. Lloyd George had refrained from any public definition of it.\r\nMore was involved, however, than “the freedom of the Straits” in the\r\nmanifesto of September 16. That manifesto was a direct descendant of\r\nthe Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907. With Habibullah dead, with Said Mir\r\nAlim in exile, with the Anglo-Persian Agreement defunct, with\r\nTrans-Caucasia again under the Russian aegis, with the Greek _fait\r\naccompli_ across the Straits in process of collapse, the now exposed\r\nBritish command of the Straits and the Black Sea was all that remained\r\nof the vast territories which the collapse of Czarist Russia had\r\nvacated before an aggressive British imperialism.\r\n\r\nOn September 30, Mr. Lloyd George sent General Harington, Allied\r\nCommander-in-Chief in Constantinople, a six-hour ultimatum ordering\r\nthe Turkish forces to withdraw from contact with the British lines\r\nbehind Chanak. If that ultimatum had been served, it would have\r\nprecipitated an Anglo-Turkish war and with British reinforcements\r\nalready streaming to the Straits, it is difficult to see with what\r\nother purpose it could have been dispatched from London. Instead of\r\nserving it, however, General Harington dropped it into his pocket and\r\nwent to Mudania on October 3 with his Allied colleagues to negotiate\r\nan armistice with Ismet Pasha. At dawn on October 11, the Mudania\r\narmistice was signed, the Allies agreeing to evacuate the Greeks from\r\nEastern Thrace immediately and to return it to Turkey up to the\r\nMaritza River, admitting the Turkish civil administration, supported\r\nby a force of 8,000 _gendarmes_, within a period of thirty days after\r\nthe Greek evacuation.\r\n\r\nOn October 19, Mr. Lloyd George who might have written the Mudania\r\narmistice in ink instead of in blood, handed his resignation to the\r\nKing. In Mr. Bonar Law’s Government, however, Lord Curzon remained at\r\nthe Foreign Office. Preparations were now made for a peace conference,\r\nbeginning at Lausanne on November 13, for the winding up of\r\nhostilities between the Allies and Turkey and between Turkey and\r\nGreece. Invitations were issued to, among others, the old Ottoman\r\nGovernment in Constantinople to send delegates to the conference. That\r\nGovernment, from the Sultan-Caliph down, had been stripped of actual\r\nauthority long before by the Allied occupation of the old capital, and\r\nthe Grand National Assembly speedily put an end to its technical\r\nexistence. On November 1, the Assembly reiterated its previous\r\ndeclaration that “the form of government based on personal sovereignty\r\nin Constantinople” had ceased to exist on March 16, 1920, adding that\r\n“the Caliphate belongs to the Ottoman dynasty and the Grand National\r\nAssembly will nominate him of the dynasty who is the most upright and\r\nwise in knowledge and character. The Turkish nation is the supporting\r\npower of the Caliphate.”\r\n\r\nOn the morning of November 4, the Constantinople Cabinet handed in its\r\nresignation to the Caliph-Sultan and at noon Rafet Pasha took over the\r\nadministration of Constantinople as one of the provincial capitals of\r\nthe new Turkish State. In the early hours of November 17, the\r\nCaliph-Sultan fled on a British battleship to Malta and on the\r\nfollowing day the Grand National Assembly at Angora elected the heir\r\npresumptive, Abdul Medjid Effendi, to the Caliphate of Islam. Turkish\r\nnationalism was continuing to surmount that Old Turkish conservatism\r\nwhich had helped to wreck the Young Turkish Revolution of 1908. As for\r\nIslam in India, such was the siege-encircled secrecy in which Turkish\r\nnationalism had developed that the end of its historic Ottoman\r\ntheocracy fell upon it as a severe blow, but it stuck loyally to “our\r\nbrother Turk.” As for the Emperor of India, he was uncertain whether\r\nthe seat of the Caliphate was Constantinople or Mecca. The ex-_Sherif_\r\nHussein had two sons perched on precarious thrones, Feisal at Bagdad\r\nand Abdullah at Amman, and had himself been referred to as “Supreme\r\nPontiff of the Islamic world and temporal ruler of Arabia.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL MOUHEDDIN PASHA\r\n\r\nMilitary Governor of Cilicia on re-occupation by Turkish forces in\r\nJanuary, 1922.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEHMED EMIN BEY\r\n\r\nThe Poet of New Turkey.]\r\n\r\nOn November 20, Lord Curzon finally opened the peace conference at\r\nLausanne, with Ismet Pasha, now Foreign Minister in the Turkish\r\nGovernment, heading the only Turkish delegation. Negotiations went\r\nforward until Jan. 31, 1923, when Lord Curzon served a draft treaty on\r\nIsmet Pasha and on the night of February 4 abruptly left for London.\r\nThis breach in the negotiations left British military and naval forces\r\nin occupation of Constantinople and the Straits, and the Greek Army\r\nfacing east along the Maritza; but the snows of the Balkans melted\r\nwithout incident. On April 23, Sir Horace Rumbold, British High\r\nCommissioner in Constantinople, took Lord Curzon’s place at the\r\nresumed conference and the Treaty of Peace, together with a number of\r\nsubsidiary documents, was finally signed at Lausanne on July 24.\r\n\r\nWe have noted previously the fate of the vast British acquisitions\r\nwhich followed the collapse of Czarist Russia. With Habibullah dead,\r\nwith Said Mir Alim in exile, with the command of the Caspian lost,\r\nwith the Anglo-Persian Agreement defunct, with the American mandate\r\nproject dead and Trans-Caucasia again under the Russian aegis, Mr.\r\nLloyd George had at last been compelled to abandon his hostility\r\ntoward both Russia and Turkey, and at the Genoa Conference in 1922 he\r\nattempted to re-write the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907 with Soviet\r\nRussia. But the Soviet had abrogated the 1907 Treaty in 1918 and in\r\n1922 it refused to purchase British recognition by a reversion to\r\nCzarist diplomacy. The liquidation of the British acquisitions\r\ncontinued. The Turkish re-occupation of Smyrna wiped out the Greek\r\n_fait accompli_ across the Straits and brought the Turks down to the\r\nAsiatic shore of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles. The Mudania armistice\r\nreturned the European shore to Turkey. Only an insecure command of the\r\nStraits and the Black Sea now remained of the vast British\r\nacquisitions of 1918 and 1919, and this remnant Lord Curzon now sought\r\nto salvage from the wreck by negotiation at Lausanne with the Turkish\r\ndelegation alone. Soviet Russia having refused to re-write the 1907\r\nTreaty against Turkey at Genoa, Lord Curzon now drew up the Straits\r\nConvention against Russia at Lausanne and on May 8, 1923, he\r\ndispatched an ultimatum from London to Moscow which seems to have been\r\ndesigned to cancel the Anglo-Russian Trade Agreement and to break off\r\nall relations with Soviet Russia. The British Foreign Office has lived\r\non wars and the brink of wars since 1914 and the time has not yet come\r\nwhen it is willing to conclude a full and normal peace with both\r\nTurkey and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Straits Convention, thus drawn without Russian collaboration at\r\nLausanne, opens the Straits to all merchantmen when Turkey is at peace\r\nand to all neutral merchantmen, subject to the Turkish right of\r\nsearch, when Turkey is at war. All warships are to be allowed passage\r\nwhen Turkey is at peace and neutral warships when Turkey is at war,\r\nboth of these provisions to be subject to a number of restrictions,\r\none of which is that the “maximum force which any one Power may send\r\nthrough the Straits into the Black Sea is not to be greater than that\r\nof the most powerful fleet of the littoral Powers of the Black Sea\r\nexisting in that sea at the time of passage; but with the proviso that\r\nthe Powers reserve to themselves the right to send into the Black Sea,\r\nat all times and under all circumstances, a force of not more than\r\nthree ships, of which no individual ship shall exceed 10,000 tons.”\r\n\r\nBy this Convention, Lord Curzon retains access to the southern and\r\nTrans-Caucasian ports of Soviet Russia. Ismet Pasha signed it in the\r\ncourse of the general signature at Lausanne on July 24. Soviet Russia\r\nsigned it at Rome on August 14. Early in September, Mr. Amery, First\r\nLord of the British Admiralty, paid a visit of inspection to Malta\r\nwhere he announced that for the next year or two the principal British\r\nsquadron would remain in the Mediterranean, and from Malta he\r\ncontinued to Constantinople.\r\n\r\nLord Curzon also succeeded at Lausanne in securing agreement that “the\r\nfrontier between Turkey and Iraq shall be laid down in friendly\r\narrangement to be concluded between Turkey and Great Britain within\r\nnine months. In the event of no agreement being reached between the\r\ntwo Governments in the time mentioned, the dispute shall be referred\r\nto the Council of the League of Nations.” The Turco-Arab split in\r\n_Sunni Islam_ which the Foreign Office engineered in 1915 through the\r\nResidency in Cairo, still lives in the Mosul controversy. Arab\r\nautonomy under the religious suzerainty of the Ottoman Caliph which\r\nRauf Bey had stipulated to Admiral Calthorpe at Mudros in 1918, still\r\nawaits, _inter alia_, the fate of Mosul.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Lausanne Conference was a rout. The military victory\r\nwhich Ismet Pasha had won over the Greeks at Smyrna, he duplicated as\r\na diplomatic victory over the Allies at Lausanne. Having salvaged the\r\nStraits Convention from the wreck and having postponed the Mosul\r\nmatter, Lord Curzon abandoned the unhappy scene on Feb. 4, 1923,\r\nleaving Sir Horace Rumbold to save what he could when the conference\r\nresumed on April 23. Ismet Pasha restricted himself as far as possible\r\nto a settlement of the political terms of peace, referring\r\nconcessionaires to his Government at Angora, but it was not until July\r\n17 that Sir Horace consented to sign peace without the Turkish\r\nGovernment’s acquiescence in the claim of the so-called Turkish\r\nPetroleum Company upon the oil of the Mosul province. Excepting for\r\nfurther negotiation over Mosul, the political terms of peace between\r\nthe Allies and Turkey were signed at Lausanne on July 24. Several of\r\nthe economic issues of the peace, the most important of which is the\r\nquestion of the currency in which Turkey is to pay interest on its\r\nshare of the Old Ottoman Public Debt, are still in process of\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\nOn August 4, terms for the resumption of diplomatic relations between\r\nthe United States and Turkey were signed at Lausanne. Relations had\r\nbeen severed on April 20, 1917, by the Enver Government at\r\nConstantinople and on May 5, 1923, Ismet Pasha had written Joseph C.\r\nGrew, American Minister to Switzerland, proposing negotiations looking\r\ntoward the resumption of regular relations. Two Turco-American\r\nTreaties resulted, one a general treaty and the other an extradition\r\ntreaty, the former recording American acquiescence in the abrogation\r\nof the Capitulations which Ismet Pasha had imposed upon the Allies.\r\nUnder this treaty, Americans and American institutions in Turkey are\r\nhereafter to be subject to Turkish law and Turkish taxes, Turkey\r\nhaving voluntarily agreed during negotiations with the Allies to\r\nappoint four legal advisers, nationals of countries neutral in the\r\nlate war, who are to serve for a term of five years and whose function\r\nis to be rigorously restricted to the offering of advice. By this\r\nabrogation of the Capitulations, Turkey enters into a status of\r\nequality in the family of nations. In July, 1894, Buddhist Japan began\r\na five-year probationary period preparatory to its acquisition of that\r\nstatus of equality which previously been the exclusive right of the\r\nChristian nations, but in July, 1923, its Treaty of Peace with the\r\nAllies conferred upon Moslem Turkey a status of immediate equality\r\nwith the Christian nations and Japan.\r\n\r\nRatification of the two Turco-American Treaties is to be exchanged at\r\nConstantinople “as soon as possible” and the Treaties are to take\r\neffect two months after ratification, the intervening period being\r\nallowed for the evacuation of the American naval forces from Turkish\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Greco-Turkish agreements signed at Lausanne on Jan. 30,\r\n1923, had preceded Greek participation in the Allied Peace Treaty of\r\nJuly 24. On January 30, Greece and Turkey agreed to exchange their\r\nMoslem and Orthodox nationals, respectively, amounting to a total of\r\npossibly 500,000 persons, exception being made for Moslems of Western\r\nThrace and Orthodox of Constantinople, Turkey permitting the\r\nOecumenical Patriarchate to remain at the Phanar in Stamboul subject\r\nto its disestablishment and to the departure of Meletios IV, the then\r\nPatriarch. With this precedent agreement, Greece recognized in the\r\nPeace Treaty of July 24 “her obligation to make reparation for the\r\ndamage caused in Anatolia by the acts of the Greek Army or\r\nadministration which were contrary to the laws of war. On the other\r\nhand, Turkey, in consideration of the financial situation of Greece\r\nresulting from the prolongation of the war and from its consequences,\r\nfinally renounces all claims for reparation against the Greek\r\nGovernment.” In lieu of reparation, Turkey accepted the suburb of\r\nKaragatch across the Maritza from Adrianople, which was surrendered by\r\nthe Greek Army on September 15 in as wrecked a condition as the towns\r\nfrom which the Greek Army had fled in Anatolia a year before.\r\n\r\nOn August 23 the Grand National Assembly at Angora ratified the Peace\r\nTreaty of Lausanne by a vote of 215 to 20, and on the following day\r\nthe Allied evacuation of Constantinople and the Straits began, to be\r\ncompleted within a period of six weeks….\r\n\r\nTo realize the meaning of the Treaty of Lausanne, we shall have to go\r\nback some distance into Ottoman history. Sultan Selim III who was\r\ndeposed in 1808, was possibly the first of the Ottoman reformers.\r\nMahmoud II who succeeded him, was another great Sultan who saw the\r\nneed of introducing Western methods into his Eastern realm, and it was\r\nhe who abolished the Janissaries in 1826 as a result of their long\r\nopposition to reform. Abdul Medjid I was a third great reformer who\r\nproclaimed the Tanzimat in 1839 under whose terms all Ottoman subjects\r\nwere to be given an equal status in temporal law. The Tanzimat dealt\r\nwith sweeping reforms in education, in methods of tax collection and\r\nin the courts, but Czarist Russia put a stop to Ottoman reform in the\r\naggression of 1853 which resulted in the Crimean War.\r\n\r\nUnder Abdul Aziz, a Western-trained group of Turks revived Ottoman\r\nreform and when Abdul Hamid II became Sultan, Midhat Pasha succeeded\r\nin proclaiming a Constitution. Again Czarist Russia put a stop to\r\nreform in the Russo-Turkish War of 1876 and the Berlin Congress\r\nadopted the title of “the Sick man of Europe” which the Czar had\r\ninvented for the Sultan. Czarist Russia and Western Europe now took\r\nover the problem of Ottoman reform themselves, directing it to the\r\nbenefit of the Sultan’s Bulgarian and Armenian subjects while passing\r\nover the equally urgent needs of his Turkish subjects. Ottoman reform\r\nas thus directed now became the fixed objective of Christendom from\r\nCzarist Russia to the country towns of the United States, while Islam\r\nin time from the Balkans to the back hills of Java became increasingly\r\nanxious over “our brother Turk.”\r\n\r\nAlarmed by the dividing effect of Ottoman reform in Western hands, the\r\nWestern-trained Young Turks again revived their own program of reform\r\nand when Sir Edward Grey agreed with Czarist Russia in 1907 on the\r\neventual partition of the Ottoman Empire, the Young Turks hurriedly\r\nrevived Midhat Pasha’s Constitution in the Revolution of 1908. But the\r\nend was already at hand. Austria-Hungary immediately annexed Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina. Bulgaria proclaimed its independence. Insurrections\r\nbegan in Albania in which Austria-Hungary was not disinterested and in\r\nKurdistan in which Czarist Russia was not disinterested. The Italians\r\nlanded in Tripoli and the First Balkan War brought the Bulgarians to\r\nthe Chatalja lines behind Constantinople, putting an end not only to\r\nany attempt at Young Turkish reform but almost to the existence of the\r\nEmpire. In the Western view, this sort of thing constituted Ottoman\r\nreform, and in 1914 the Anglo-Russian combination closed on the Empire\r\nand reformed it out of existence. The Sevres Treaty in 1920 finally\r\nwrote the last chapter in the story of Western reform by proposing to\r\nhand over the richest provinces of the Turkish country to Greeks and\r\nArmenians while denying the Turks any right whatever to an independent\r\nexistence. The Sevres Treaty was and still is a full and complete\r\ndefinition of the word “reform” when applied by Allied diplomacy to\r\nTurkish lands.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Young Turks abrogated the Capitulations in 1914\r\nand with their hands untied for the first time in their modern\r\nhistory, a number of other reforms followed in rapid succession\r\ndespite the fact that they were engaged in a world war. When Rauf Bey\r\nmet Admiral Calthorpe at Mudros to apply for an armistice in 1918, he\r\nstipulated that the abrogation of the Capitulations would have to be\r\nrecognized, but the first act of the Allies upon occupying\r\nConstantinople was to re-impose the Capitulations and to undo every\r\nreform which the Young Turks had succeeded in making. Within a few\r\nmonths, the Greek occupation of Smyrna threw the Young Turks into the\r\nheart of Anatolia. Turkish nationalism repeated and amplified Rauf\r\nBey’s stipulations at Mudros in the Erzerum program of 1919. The\r\nOttoman Parliament committed itself to the Erzerum program early in\r\n1920 under the name of the National Pact. British officers reformed\r\nthe Ottoman Parliament out of existence on the night of March 15-16,\r\n1920, but away in the heart of Anatolia Turkish nationalism possessed\r\nas free a hand for its own program of reform as its state of siege\r\npermitted. What the Sevres Treaty was to Western reform in Turkey, the\r\nGrand National Assembly became to Turkish reform in Turkey; and when\r\nSoviet Russia recognized the National Pact in 1921, the fingers which\r\nhad long strangled Ottoman reform were removed, temporarily at least,\r\nfrom the Turkish throat.\r\n\r\nAfghanistan quickly recognized the Pact. The three Soviet Republics of\r\nTrans-Caucasia recognized it. Insofar as it concerned Cilicia, France\r\nrecognized it. Soviet Ukrainia recognized it early in 1922. Insofar as\r\nit concerned Eastern Thrace, Mr. Lloyd George and his Foreign\r\nSecretary recognized it at the point of the bayonet in the Mudania\r\narmistice. But at Lausanne, Ismet Pasha placed the rest of the Pact\r\nbefore Lord Curzon and early in 1923 Lord Curzon, having swallowed a\r\nfew drops of the nasty stuff, returned to London. There seemed then to\r\nbe as little chance of Ismet Pasha’s diplomatic success as there had\r\nonce seemed to be of Fevzi Pasha’s military success, but Turkish\r\nreform would not be alive today if it had not learned long ago to\r\nachieve the impossible. Little by little, Ismet Pasha dropped away the\r\nnon-essentials of the Pact while holding fast to the abrogation of the\r\nCapitulations which the Enver Government had decreed on Sept. 28,\r\n1914, and on July 24, 1923, the British Foreign Office finally\r\naccorded its recognition to the essentials of the National Pact,\r\nexception being made for further negotiation over Mosul.\r\n\r\nFor the last century, the Ottoman Empire has sought justice at the\r\nhands of Czarist Russia and the West. Czarist Russia has finally\r\nceased to exist and Turkey has finally gained justice from the West at\r\nthe point of the bayonet, a fact which we Christians of the West might\r\ndo well to ponder. It secured from the West at Lausanne a belated\r\nrecognition of its right to control its own reforms in its own country\r\nand since Czarist Russia and the West by their long endeavor to impose\r\nreforms from without for the exclusive benefit of the Turk’s\r\nminorities, have made it impossible for the Turk and his minorities to\r\nlive together, the Turk today has only himself to consider in Turkey.\r\nInsofar as no further Western attempts are made to strangle Turkish\r\nreform (and if the past is any clew to the future, such attempts are\r\nquite certain to be made), the future of Turkey now depends on the\r\nTurk. We know at last who is responsible in Turkey, and this is a very\r\nsubstantial gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nTHE REAL PROBLEM OF TURKISH NATIONALISM\r\n\r\nECONOMIC BEGINNINGS IN THE NEW TURKISH STATE――MUSTAPHA KEMAL PASHA\r\nOPENS THE SMYRNA CONGRESS――THE CHESTER CONCESSION A STEP FROM\r\nIMPERIALISM TO LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Erzerum program had been definitely committed to\r\nnegotiation at Lausanne, Mustapha Kemal Pasha lost no time in\r\ndiverting into the ways of peace the energy with which Turkish\r\nnationalism had re-mobilized and re-equipped its Armies. For the\r\nbuilding up of a new and Western economic tradition with which to\r\nsupplement the old and Eastern military tradition which had long\r\ndistinguished its nation, the new Turkish Government had laid its\r\nfoundations well. It had refrained from the issue of paper money,\r\nconfining itself to the use of paper issued by the old Ottoman\r\nGovernment during the war. As fast as this paper became worn out, it\r\nwas sent to the headquarters of the Public Debt administration in\r\nConstantinople to be exchanged for clean paper. Unlike a number of\r\npost-war European Governments, it had refrained from financing itself\r\nby the use of the printing press but the merit of this achievement is\r\nof course lessened by the primitive nature of the country which it\r\ngoverned. A country which could survive forty percent requisitions\r\nhardly needed to use the printing press. If many of its minor\r\nofficials and soldiers never saw a pay-day, it was not money which had\r\ndrawn them into the bitter loneliness of Angora. The deputies in the\r\nAssembly were paid out of the _Evkaf_ (Moslem religious endowments) in\r\ntheir constituencies. Mustapha Kemal Pasha himself was paid £T300 a\r\nmonth, a salary which in its buying power in Asia Minor today, is\r\nequivalent to about £T75, or $375, pre-war. The cost of living has\r\ngone up severely in Asia Minor but not quite as severely as it has in\r\nthe West. A camel which before the war could have been bought for £T25\r\ngold, will now cost about £T100 paper.\r\n\r\nGold has completely disappeared from circulation, most of it drained\r\naway to Germany during the war. There is a little nickel in\r\ncirculation, but practically all transactions in Asia Minor, however\r\nsmall, are conducted in paper. By the time the Battle of the Sakaria\r\nRiver was fought and won, the Government had collected a gold reserve\r\nwhich amounted to about £T1,000,000 (say $5,000,000) in Ottoman and\r\nother gold coins and about 200 kilos of bar gold. Its trade had been\r\ndestroyed, its population had been broken, it was confronted with\r\ngreat devastated areas in the “Pontus,” in Cilicia, in the eastern\r\nprovinces and behind Smyrna. Its financial position was about as low\r\nas can be imagined, but it must be emphasized that low as its\r\nfinancial position was, it was sound. The foundation was good, and the\r\nonly question pertaining to it was the durability of the economic\r\nstructure which the Turk would prove himself able to build upon it.\r\n\r\nThe abrogation of the Capitulations on Sept. 28, 1914, had turned the\r\ncustoms traiff over to the Government and when Angora inherited the\r\nburden of debt and undevelopment which had borne Constantinople down,\r\nthe customs tariff was increased from five to fifteen times over the\r\nold Capitulatory tariff. This was done primarily for protective\r\npurposes. Insofar as the war permitted, the development of home\r\nindustries was to be given every possible stimulus. Even down to such\r\nminor industries as the manufacture of men’s headwear, nationalist\r\nsolicitude for home industries was quickly shown. Presumably one\r\nreason why the lamb-skin _kalpak_ has been substituted in the new\r\nTurkey for the old Ottoman _fez_, is the fact that _fezzes_ were\r\nmanufactured in Austria. Although it deprived the Government of a\r\nrevenue which was said to amount to £T4,000,000 a year at a time when\r\nit needed every _piaster_ it could lay its hands on, country-wide\r\nprohibition was voted soon after the Grand National Assembly was\r\nconvened at Angora.\r\n\r\nSince Asia Minor is in large part an agricultural area, the\r\nGovernment’s first economic plans were directed toward the development\r\nof agriculture, and a scheme was evolved under which farm machinery\r\nwas to be purchased abroad by a Government company and distributed\r\nthrough the branches of the Government’s Agricultural Bank. This\r\nscheme may or may not materialize as the Government enters more fully\r\ninto foreign commercial relationships, but its spirit is highly\r\nsignificant. Trade has passed definitely into the hands of the Turks\r\nand in the building up of an economic tradition to which the Turks\r\nhave heretofore been strangers, Turkish nationalism confronts its real\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 17, 1923, Mustapha Kemal Pasha opened the country’s first\r\neconomic congress at Smyrna. More than 500 delegates were present.\r\nFarmers and producers were given the center block of seats, traders\r\nand business men the right block, and skilled workmen the left block,\r\nwith a special section of the hall given over to an exhibition of\r\nagricultural machinery, most of it from the United States. It was a\r\nunique event in Turkish history, and its significance may be gathered\r\nfrom Kemal Pasha’s opening address, which merits quotation in part:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, when history applies itself to searching the causes of the\r\ngrandeur and of the decadence of a people, it invokes political,\r\nmilitary and social reasons. It is evident that ultimately all the\r\nreasons spring from social conditions but that which is in closest\r\nbearing to the existence, the prosperity and the decadence of a people\r\nis its economics. This historical truth is confirmed in our existence\r\nand our national history. In fact, if one examines the history of the\r\nTurkish people, one will see that her grandeur and her decadence are\r\nmerely corollaries of her economic life. So in order to raise the new\r\nTurkey to the desired level, it is necessary, cost what it may, to\r\naccord all our solicitude to the questions which concern her\r\neconomics.\r\n\r\n“In the course of Ottoman history, all the efforts employed, all the\r\nactivities of her statesmen, have had as their aim, not to satisfy the\r\ndesires of the people nor to realize their aspirations, but rather to\r\nappease petty yearnings and personal ambitions. Comrades, if one\r\nexamines closely the reigns of Mohammed II, of Selim and of Suleiman,\r\none finds that these great and powerful monarchs based their foreign\r\npolicy on their desires to satiate their personal leanings and\r\nambitions. They had thus to regulate their internal organization in\r\naccordance with their foreign policy. Now foreign policy ought to be,\r\non the contrary, subordinated to the internal organization――that is to\r\nsay, foreign policy should be dominated by the internal economic\r\nsituation.”\r\n\r\nKemal Pasha went on to explain that the monarchical policy of\r\nsubordinating internal organization to foreign policy, had led to the\r\nnecessity of allowing conquered elements to retain their national\r\norganizations in which they devoted themselves peacefully to economic\r\npursuits while the “essential element” protected them, wielding the\r\nsword against their enemies on every frontier of the Empire.\r\n“Gentlemen, those who effect conquests by the sword finish by being\r\nbeaten by those who employ as their arm the plow, and by ceding their\r\nplace to them. In the struggle between the sword and the plow, it is\r\nalways the plow which comes out on top.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as Rauf Bey returned from Malta, he was given the Ministry of\r\nPublic Works at Angora, where the elaboration of a scheme of railway\r\ndevelopment was given immediate attention. Negotiations ensued with\r\nthe representatives of the Ottoman-American Development Company,\r\nbacked by Rear Admiral Colby M. Chester, U. S. N. (retired), who had\r\nbeen in previous negotiation with the old Ottoman Government in\r\nConstantinople. On April 11, 1923, the development scheme which the\r\nGovernment had formulated, was made over to the Ottoman-American\r\nCompany by the Grand National Assembly and on April 30, the Minister\r\nof Public Works signed a convention with two representatives of the\r\nCompany for what has long been famous as the Chester Concession.\r\n\r\nThis Turkish program falls into three parts――the construction of 2,714\r\nmiles of new railway line, the construction of a new capital city at\r\nAngora and of ports at Samsun, Yamurtalik and Trebizond together with\r\nthe re-construction of towns and villages wrecked by the Greeks, and\r\nthe exploitation of mineral rights within twenty-_kilometer_ zones on\r\neach side of the new railway lines. The convention with the Chester\r\ngroup runs for a term of ninety-nine years unless the Turkish\r\nGovernment chooses to exercise its right of purchase after thirty\r\nyears. The Turkish company which is to operate the new railway lines\r\nis to pay thirty percent of its profits to the Government and is to be\r\nsubject to all Turkish taxation except customs duties on its\r\nconstruction materials and its coal, the latter of which is to be\r\nexempt for a period of ten years only. The company may employ foreign\r\nexperts (the original Chester project of 1909 stipulated that they\r\nwere to wear the _fez_ and a Government uniform), but Turks are to be\r\ntrained to take their places and the labor gangs are to be purely\r\nTurkish. There is no _kilometric_ guarantee, nor does the Concession\r\nadd any financial burden to the burdens which the Turkish Government\r\nalready bears, until such time as the Government may decide to take\r\nover the lines.\r\n\r\nThe backbone of this Turkish program is its railway scheme, and in\r\nthis respect it differs widely from the original Chester project of\r\n1909. Czarist Russia having disappeared, the Turkish Government now\r\nrevives the central Anatolian scheme which was first suggested for the\r\nBagdad Railway and vetoed by Russia. It proposes to extend the\r\nEski-Shehr-Angora line which was orginally intended for the main line\r\nof the Bagdad Railway, to Sivas, Kharput, Diarbekr and Mosul, but it\r\nadapts its railway program to the needs which have developed during\r\nthe last four years. It may be assumed that military considerations\r\nhave played a part in the framing of the Government’s railway scheme,\r\nfor the war in Europe is not yet ended, and nobody knows how long a\r\nbreathing space Turkey is to be permitted.\r\n\r\nThe first line to be built is to be the Yamurtalik-Kharput-Bitlis\r\nline, with a branch dropping to Mosul, Kirkuk and Suleimanieh. If and\r\nwhen this line is completed, it will strengthen the Syrian and\r\nMesopotamian frontiers, and its western end, terminating in an\r\nexcellent harbor at Yamurtalik on the Turkish side of Alexandretta\r\nBay, will afford the Government a port which it sorely needs on the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe second line to be built is to be the Angora-Erzerum line with\r\nbranches dropping to Samsun and Trebizond on the Black Sea. At present\r\nthe Government has no access by rail to any of its Black Sea ports.\r\nPossibly if it had had speedy access to the “Pontus” provinces, they\r\nwould not have been devastated by irregular warfare during these last\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nThe final lines to be built are embodied in a group by which the\r\nAngora-Sivas line is to be connected _via_ Caesarea with Ulu Kishla on\r\nthe Bagdad Railway, and the Erzerum line is to be extended to Bayazid\r\non the Persian frontier. The Erzerum and Bayazid lines in the eastern\r\nprovinces are of obvious bearing on any future Russian attempt to\r\nrepeat the great invasion of 1915-’16. They are of more meaning than\r\nthat. At present Soviet Russia and Turkey are at peace with each\r\nother, and if and when the railway program which the Turkish\r\nGovernment has made over to the Chester group is completed, Russia may\r\nbe afforded an overland outlet to the Mediterranean at Yamurtalik. The\r\nRussian and Turkish gauges differ, the former being 5 feet and the\r\nlatter 4 feet 8½ inches, but the political possibilities in affording\r\nSoviet Russia peacefully what Czarist Russia sought by force, are\r\nincalculable. Peaceful access to the Mediterranean over the Chester\r\nlines might easily reduce the Straits to a very small factor in\r\nRussia’s foreign policy. While Turkey is not a Socialist State and\r\npresumably will not be, Russo-Turkish peace is the very foundation of\r\nany world peace and if the Chester group is able to contribute\r\neffectively to an enduring Russo-Turkish peace, it will perform a\r\nservice of incalculable worth to the cause of world peace.\r\n\r\nA month after the grant of the Chester Concession, Allied\r\nconcessionaires began filtering into Angora from Constantinople, to\r\nbegin economic negotiations with the Turkish Government simultaneously\r\nwith the political negotiations which were dragging toward an end at\r\nLausanne. These economic negotiations comprised four subjects: (1) the\r\nstatus of pre-war concessions; (2) the status of modifications\r\nauthorized by the Ottoman Government after the Mudros armistice; (3)\r\ncompensation for war damage to the property of concessionaires; and\r\n(4) the extension of concessions for a period equal to that in which\r\nthey had been non-operative during the war. By the middle of June, the\r\nConstantinople Telephone Company (British) had reached agreement with\r\nthe Turkish Government. Early in July, similar agreements had been\r\nreached by the Smyrna-Aidin Railway (British) and the Mudania-Brussa\r\nRailway (French).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Assembly adjourned for new elections. Peace not yet\r\nhaving been signed at Lausanne, the Nationalist Party went to the\r\ncountry on the basis of the National Pact and was returned by an\r\noverwhelming majority. It was a war election, somewhat reminiscent of\r\nMr. Lloyd George’s “khaki election” of 1918, and party government with\r\na strong Opposition in the Assembly is hardly to be expected at Angora\r\nuntil after an assured peace has come to Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe Second Assembly was convened in the gray granite building at the\r\nfoot of Angora on August 11 and Mustapha Kemal Pasha was re-elected\r\nPresident by 196 of the 197 deputies who had reached the capital.\r\nPresumably the lone dissenting vote was the vote of “the Pasha”\r\nhimself. Ali Fethy Bey, Minister of the Interior, was elected Prime\r\nMinister in place of Rauf Bey and most of the remaining Ministers were\r\nre-elected, Ismet Pasha retaining the portfolio of Foreign Affairs and\r\nFevzi Pasha remaining Chief of the General Staff. The Treaty of\r\nLausanne having been ratified on August 23, the Assembly lost no time\r\nin approaching the urgent problem of its own economy and on September\r\n5 Fethy Bey announced the main lines of the Government’s policy. He\r\nstressed first the problem of finance and the necessity of readjusting\r\ntaxation. Further points on which the Government proposed to\r\nconcentrate, he said, were the schools system and the _gendarmerie_.\r\nHis speech was noteworthy for the brevity of its references to foreign\r\naffairs. Given peace abroad, the Government’s program as enunciated by\r\nFethy Bey is an internal program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nTHE REBIRTH OF TURKEY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the rebirth of Turkey, this narrative approaches its end. With\r\nthe coming of a probable peace, the passions which have been raised in\r\nthe Near and Middle East need sorely to be allayed, and there would be\r\nsmall usefulness in this narrative of the destruction they have\r\nworked, if the past did not contain its element of useful guidance for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nWe in the West are heavily in debt to England. It is England which has\r\nslowly and laboriously fashioned our Western tradition of democratic\r\ngovernment and that tradition has placed us all incalculably in\r\nEngland’s debt. That tradition is still evolving and England is still,\r\nas it has always been, the scene of its evolution. But in\r\nacknowledging our debt to England, we need to think clearly, to\r\ndistinguish sharply between the British democracy and the British\r\nForeign Office. Between the two, there is no effective connection. The\r\nForeign Office is outside the British Constitution and is not subject\r\nto the effective control of the British Parliament. British foreign\r\npolicy in the Near and Middle East neither originates in Parliament\r\nnor is controlled by Parliament. This is a state of things which has\r\nbeen at once a source of enormous strength to British diplomacy and a\r\nsource of enormous danger to world peace.\r\n\r\nIt was through the British Foreign Office, under Sir Edward Grey’s\r\nSecretaryship, that the British democracy was tied to Czarist Russia\r\nin the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1907. The British democracy did not\r\nknow it at the time nor does it realize to this day the meaning of the\r\n1907 Treaty, for its Foreign Office has been as blinkers fastened\r\nabout its eyes. There came a time in 1914 when Czarist Russia clashed\r\nwith Germany over the control of the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire.\r\nSir Edward Grey had tied the British democracy to Czarist Russia and\r\nin 1914 it remained so tied. Whether Sir Edward Grey permitted his\r\ncountry to believe that the war was to be fought over Belgium and\r\nunder this impression brought his country into the war, is a question\r\nwhich the British democracy may some day succeed in settling with its\r\nown Foreign Office. Events, however, would appear to indicate that\r\nBasra was more intimately connected with the Foreign Office’s actual\r\nwar aims than Belgium was. Three weeks before the Enver Government at\r\nConstantinople entered the war, a British Indian brigade lay off\r\nBahrein Island in the Persian Gulf and when German naval officers\r\nhustled the Enver Government into the war by bombarding Odessa, events\r\nplayed straight into the Foreign Office’s hand. The brigade off\r\nBahrein struck at Basra instantly and Sir Edward Grey, in conjunction\r\nwith Czarist Russia, began that partitioning of the Ottoman Empire\r\nwhich had been envisaged in 1907. Czarist Russia was to receive\r\nConstantinople and the eastern provinces, the Foreign Office was to\r\nachieve its Cape-to-Cairo-to-Calcutta scheme, and the Ottoman\r\nCaliphate of Islam was to be destroyed. But of all this the British\r\ndemocracy knew little until Czarist Russia collapsed in 1917 and\r\nSoviet Russia published the secret treaties which it discovered in the\r\nCzarist archives at Petrograd.\r\n\r\nDeprived of its Czarist accomplice at the very peak of its history,\r\ndeprived even of the tame Kerensky _regime_, the British Foreign\r\nOffice in 1919 sought American aid in holding its position. Viscount\r\nGrey of Fallodon was dispatched to Washington and American churchmen,\r\nwith the best intentions in the world, attempted to tie upon American\r\neyes the same Armenian blind as they had permitted to be tied upon\r\ntheir own eyes. But the United States Government does not conduct its\r\nforeign affairs as the British Foreign Office does. Viscount Grey went\r\nback to London and the Armenian mandate scheme fell through. The\r\neffort to establish a closer relationship between England and the\r\nUnited States still continues, however, and it would be interesting to\r\nknow to what extent, if any, it is directed toward an Anglo-American\r\ncombination against Islam in succession to the Anglo-Russian\r\ncombination of 1907. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that we in\r\nthe United States are under an incalculable debt to the British\r\ndemocracy, but to the British Foreign Office we owe nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish recovery of Smyrna in 1922 stripped the blind from the\r\neyes of the British democracy, but its Foreign Office blinkers are\r\nstill fastened about its eyes. Mr. Lloyd George has fallen but Lord\r\nCurzon still remains. British diplomacy does not lightly change its\r\naims and the Turk whose end was decreed in 1907, is still an unwelcome\r\noutsider in the field of British diplomacy. Lord Curzon has held most\r\nof his gains in the Arab lands of the old Ottoman Empire, but in the\r\nface of the Turkish recovery he has retreated by inches. He still has\r\na Greek frontier on the Maritza River, 250 miles from Constantinople,\r\nhe still perpetuates the split in Islam which pivots on Mosul, he\r\nstill refuses to recognize, even in the elaboration of a new _regime_\r\nfor the Straits, the indubitable fact of Soviet Russia. Some day the\r\nBritish democracy may succeed in removing the blinkers from its eyes,\r\nin reducing its Foreign Office to an ordinary department of its\r\nGovernment, responsible as its other Government departments are, to\r\nits Parliament. Some day the Foreign Office may become the mouthpiece\r\nof an informed democracy. In a day when diplomacy is passing to the\r\nbasis of trade, when British Conservatism has already passed to a\r\nbusiness basis, the end of the present anachronism at the Foreign\r\nOffice may be not distant.\r\n\r\nWe need to be scrupulously fair, however, to Mr. Lloyd George and his\r\nForeign Secretary. Rid of any actual responsibility to Parliament,\r\nthey have kicked the beaten Turks into such independence as they have\r\nnever known since the golden days of the Ottoman Empire. Thanks to the\r\nabsolutism which Mr. Lloyd George enjoyed, the Turks have finally\r\nattained a degree of nationhood “one and indivisible” which is far\r\nbeyond what the most visionary Young Turks of 1908 hoped to attain.\r\nTheir historic Christian communities have been rooted up and deported\r\nfrom the land in which they had lived for four peaceful centuries\r\nunder the rule of the Ottoman Caliph, and for this truly colossal\r\nachievement the thanks of a grateful Christendom are due to Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge, who attempted to impose alone upon Islam that fate which Sir\r\nEdward Grey had agreed in 1907 to impose in conjunction with Czarist\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nThe disestablished Oecumenical Patriarchate still remains in\r\nConstantinople and the departure of Meletios IV on July 10, 1923, may\r\nopen its doors to the new Turkish Orthodox Church of Anatolia. The day\r\nseems to be at hand when the remnant of the Turkish Christians, welded\r\nfirmly into the Turkish State by the flame of nationalism, may restore\r\nthe Patriarchate to those exclusively religious functions which in the\r\nWestern view are the only proper functions of a Church.\r\n\r\nNationalism which proposes to substitute its new Eastern _regime_ of\r\nlaw for the old lawlessness of Western imperialism, is the driving\r\nforce of Turkey today and Turkey happens to be the key country of the\r\nworld. Nationalism in Turkey today welds and does not divide. Its cry\r\nstrikes a sound and healthy note. I heard it in its purest form at\r\nAdana. It was in a theatre, filled to overflowing with Turkish\r\nofficers, Turkish townsmen and Turkish peasants. Beyond the\r\nfootlights, framed in the little proscenium of the theatre, stood the\r\nplump figure of the poet, Mehmed Emin Bey, now an old man of\r\nseventy-two, his voice hoarsened to a whisper, the perspiration\r\nstreaming from beneath his _kalpak_, as he intoned his verse in liquid\r\nTurkish. Once a lonely cry in the wilderness, his voice that night was\r\npunctuated with quick applause. For twenty years he has been lifting\r\nup his cry and today he is still making his way through the scorched\r\nand decimated villages of Turkey, still burning himself out with his\r\nold cry:\r\n\r\n  “_I am a Turk_;\r\n\r\n  “_My race and language are great_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note:\r\n\r\nThe one footnote was moved to the end of the chapter in which its\r\nrelated anchor occurs.\r\n\r\nDialect, obsolete and alternative spellings, and misspelled words\r\nwere left unchanged.\r\n\r\nInconsistent hyphenation was not changed.\r\n\r\nDuplicate partial words at line endings were removed.\r\n\r\nThe text of one sentence, in which one or more lines of text were\r\nmisplaced, was not changed:\r\n\r\n     However narrow Old Turkish opinion was, however stubbornly\r\n     it confined the Young Turks to a rigidly conservative\r\n     interpretation of the Caliphate, Islam in India could\r\n     Caliphate may have come to be two quite separate adjust its\r\n     Caliphate to such modern and healthy growths as that of Arab\r\n     nationalism.\r\n\r\nTwo instances of wrong usage of words were not changed:\r\n\r\n     “are” should be “the” ―― “We in are West who are accustomed …”\r\n     “no” should be “not” ―― “… was no in contact …”",
