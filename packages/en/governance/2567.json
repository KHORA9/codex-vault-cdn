  "content": "A PLEA FOR CAPTAIN JOHN BROWN \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n By Henry David Thoreau \r\n\r\n\r\n[Read to the citizens of Concord, Mass.,\r\n\r\nSunday Evening, October 30, 1859.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI trust that you will pardon me for being here. I do not wish to force\r\nmy thoughts upon you, but I feel forced myself. Little as I know of\r\nCaptain Brown, I would fain do my part to correct the tone and the\r\nstatements of the newspapers, and of my countrymen generally,\r\nrespecting his character and actions. It costs us nothing to be just.\r\nWe can at least express our sympathy with, and admiration of, him and\r\nhis companions, and that is what I now propose to do.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to his history. I will endeavor to omit, as much as possible,\r\nwhat you have already read. I need not describe his person to you, for\r\nprobably most of you have seen and will not soon forget him. I am told\r\nthat his grandfather, John Brown, was an officer in the Revolution;\r\nthat he himself was born in Connecticut about the beginning of this\r\ncentury, but early went with his father to Ohio. I heard him say that\r\nhis father was a contractor who furnished beef to the army there, in\r\nthe war of 1812; that he accompanied him to the camp, and assisted him\r\nin that employment, seeing a good deal of military life, more, perhaps,\r\nthan if he had been a soldier, for he was often present at the councils\r\nof the officers. Especially, he learned by experience how armies are\r\nsupplied and maintained in the field—a work which, he observed,\r\nrequires at least as much experience and skill as to lead them in\r\nbattle. He said that few persons had any conception of the cost, even\r\nthe pecuniary cost, of firing a single bullet in war. He saw enough, at\r\nany rate, to disgust him with a military life, indeed to excite in him\r\na great abhorrence of it; so much so, that though he was tempted by the\r\noffer of some petty office in the army, when he was about eighteen, he\r\nnot only declined that, but he also refused to train when warned, and\r\nwas fined for it. He then resolved that he would never have anything to\r\ndo with any war, unless it were a war for liberty.\r\n\r\nWhen the troubles in Kansas began, he sent several of his sons thither\r\nto strengthen the party of the Free State men, fitting them out with\r\nsuch weapons as he had; telling them that if the troubles should\r\nincrease, and there should be need of him, he would follow, to assist\r\nthem with his hand and counsel. This, as you all know, he soon after\r\ndid; and it was through his agency, far more than any other’s, that\r\nKansas was made free.\r\n\r\nFor a part of his life he was a surveyor, and at one time he was\r\nengaged in wool-growing, and he went to Europe as an agent about that\r\nbusiness. There, as everywhere, he had his eyes about him, and made\r\nmany original observations. He said, for instance, that he saw why the\r\nsoil of England was so rich, and that of Germany (I think it was) so\r\npoor, and he thought of writing to some of the crowned heads about it.\r\nIt was because in England the peasantry live on the soil which they\r\ncultivate, but in Germany they are gathered into villages, at night. It\r\nis a pity that he did not make a book of his observations.\r\n\r\nI should say that he was an old-fashioned man in respect for the\r\nConstitution, and his faith in the permanence of this Union. Slavery he\r\ndeemed to be wholly opposed to these, and he was its determined foe.\r\n\r\nHe was by descent and birth a New England farmer, a man of great common\r\nsense, deliberate and practical as that class is, and tenfold more so.\r\nHe was like the best of those who stood at Concord Bridge once, on\r\nLexington Common, and on Bunker Hill, only he was firmer and higher\r\nprincipled than any that I have chanced to hear of as there. It was no\r\nabolition lecturer that converted him. Ethan Allen and Stark, with whom\r\nhe may in some respects be compared, were rangers in a lower and less\r\nimportant field. They could bravely face their country’s foes, but he\r\nhad the courage to face his country herself, when she was in the wrong.\r\nA Western writer says, to account for his escape from so many perils,\r\nthat he was concealed under a “rural exterior”; as if, in that prairie\r\nland, a hero should, by good rights, wear a citizen’s dress only.\r\n\r\nHe did not go to the college called Harvard, good old Alma Mater as she\r\nis. He was not fed on the pap that is there furnished. As he phrased\r\nit, “I know no more of grammar than one of your calves.” But he went to\r\nthe great university of the West, where he sedulously pursued the study\r\nof Liberty, for which he had early betrayed a fondness, and having\r\ntaken many degrees, he finally commenced the public practice of\r\nHumanity in Kansas, as you all know. Such were _his humanities_, and\r\nnot any study of grammar. He would have left a Greek accent slanting\r\nthe wrong way, and righted up a falling man.\r\n\r\nHe was one of that class of whom we hear a great deal, but, for the\r\nmost part, see nothing at all—the Puritans. It would be in vain to kill\r\nhim. He died lately in the time of Cromwell, but he reappeared here.\r\nWhy should he not? Some of the Puritan stock are said to have come over\r\nand settled in New England. They were a class that did something else\r\nthan celebrate their forefathers’ day, and eat parched corn in\r\nremembrance of that time. They were neither Democrats nor Republicans,\r\nbut men of simple habits, straightforward, prayerful; not thinking much\r\nof rulers who did not fear God, not making many compromises, nor\r\nseeking after available candidates.\r\n\r\n“In his camp,” as one has recently written, and as I have myself heard\r\nhim state, “he permitted no profanity; no man of loose morals was\r\nsuffered to remain there, unless, indeed, as a prisoner of war. ‘I\r\nwould rather,’ said he, ‘have the small-pox, yellow fever, and cholera,\r\nall together in my camp, than a man without principle.... It is a\r\nmistake, sir, that our people make, when they think that bullies are\r\nthe best fighters, or that they are the fit men to oppose these\r\nSoutherners. Give me men of good principles,—God-fearing men,—men who\r\nrespect themselves, and with a dozen of them I will oppose any hundred\r\nsuch men as these Buford ruffians.’” He said that if one offered\r\nhimself to be a soldier under him, who was forward to tell what he\r\ncould or would do, if he could only get sight of the enemy, he had but\r\nlittle confidence in him.\r\n\r\nHe was never able to find more than a score or so of recruits whom he\r\nwould accept, and only about a dozen, among them his sons, in whom he\r\nhad perfect faith. When he was here, some years ago, he showed to a few\r\na little manuscript book,—his “orderly book” I think he called\r\nit,—containing the names of his company in Kansas, and the rules by\r\nwhich they bound themselves; and he stated that several of them had\r\nalready sealed the contract with their blood. When some one remarked\r\nthat, with the addition of a chaplain, it would have been a perfect\r\nCromwellian troop, he observed that he would have been glad to add a\r\nchaplain to the list, if he could have found one who could fill that\r\noffice worthily. It is easy enough to find one for the United States\r\narmy. I believe that he had prayers in his camp morning and evening,\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of Spartan habits, and at sixty was scrupulous about his\r\ndiet at your table, excusing himself by saying that he must eat\r\nsparingly and fare hard, as became a soldier or one who was fitting\r\nhimself for difficult enterprises, a life of exposure.\r\n\r\nA man of rare common sense and directness of speech, as of action; a\r\ntranscendentalist above all, a man of ideas and principles,—that was\r\nwhat distinguished him. Not yielding to a whim or transient impulse,\r\nbut carrying out the purpose of a life. I noticed that he did not\r\noverstate anything, but spoke within bounds. I remember, particularly,\r\nhow, in his speech here, he referred to what his family had suffered in\r\nKansas, without ever giving the least vent to his pent-up fire. It was\r\na volcano with an ordinary chimney-flue. Also referring to the deeds of\r\ncertain Border Ruffians, he said, rapidly paring away his speech, like\r\nan experienced soldier, keeping a reserve of force and meaning, “They\r\nhad a perfect right to be hung.” He was not in the least a rhetorician,\r\nwas not talking to Buncombe or his constituents anywhere, had no need\r\nto invent anything but to tell the simple truth, and communicate his\r\nown resolution; therefore he appeared incomparably strong, and\r\neloquence in Congress and elsewhere seemed to me at a discount. It was\r\nlike the speeches of Cromwell compared with those of an ordinary king.\r\n\r\nAs for his tact and prudence, I will merely say, that at a time when\r\nscarcely a man from the Free States was able to reach Kansas by any\r\ndirect route, at least without having his arms taken from him, he,\r\ncarrying what imperfect guns and other weapons he could collect, openly\r\nand slowly drove an ox-cart through Missouri, apparently in the\r\ncapacity of a surveyor, with his surveying compass exposed in it, and\r\nso passed unsuspected, and had ample opportunity to learn the designs\r\nof the enemy. For some time after his arrival he still followed the\r\nsame profession. When, for instance, he saw a knot of the ruffians on\r\nthe prairie, discussing, of course, the single topic which then\r\noccupied their minds, he would, perhaps, take his compass and one of\r\nhis sons, and proceed to run an imaginary line right through the very\r\nspot on which that conclave had assembled, and when he came up to them,\r\nhe would naturally pause and have some talk with them, learning their\r\nnews, and, at last, all their plans perfectly; and having thus\r\ncompleted his real survey he would resume his imaginary one, and run on\r\nhis line till he was out of sight.\r\n\r\nWhen I expressed surprise that he could live in Kansas at all, with a\r\nprice set upon his head, and so large a number, including the\r\nauthorities, exasperated against him, he accounted for it by saying,\r\n“It is perfectly well understood that I will not be taken.” Much of the\r\ntime for some years he has had to skulk in swamps, suffering from\r\npoverty and from sickness, which was the consequence of exposure,\r\nbefriended only by Indians and a few whites. But though it might be\r\nknown that he was lurking in a particular swamp, his foes commonly did\r\nnot care to go in after him. He could even come out into a town where\r\nthere were more Border Ruffians than Free State men, and transact some\r\nbusiness, without delaying long, and yet not be molested; for said he,\r\n“No little handful of men were willing to undertake it, and a large\r\nbody could not be got together in season.”\r\n\r\nAs for his recent failure, we do not know the facts about it. It was\r\nevidently far from being a wild and desperate attempt. His enemy, Mr.\r\nVallandigham, is compelled to say, that “it was among the best planned\r\nand executed conspiracies that ever failed.”\r\n\r\nNot to mention his other successes, was it a failure, or did it show a\r\nwant of good management, to deliver from bondage a dozen human beings,\r\nand walk off with them by broad daylight, for weeks if not months, at a\r\nleisurely pace, through one State after another, for half the length of\r\nthe North, conspicuous to all parties, with a price set upon his head,\r\ngoing into a court room on his way and telling what he had done, thus\r\nconvincing Missouri that it was not profitable to try to hold slaves in\r\nhis neighborhood?—and this, not because the government menials were\r\nlenient, but because they were afraid of him.\r\n\r\nYet he did not attribute his success, foolishly, to “his star,” or to\r\nany magic. He said, truly, that the reason why such greatly superior\r\nnumbers quailed before him was, as one of his prisoners confessed,\r\nbecause they _lacked a cause_—a kind of armor which he and his party\r\nnever lacked. When the time came, few men were found willing to lay\r\ndown their lives in defence of what they knew to be wrong; they did not\r\nlike that this should be their last act in this world.\r\n\r\nBut to make haste to _his_ last act, and its effects.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers seem to ignore, or perhaps are really ignorant of the\r\nfact, that there are at least as many as two or three individuals to a\r\ntown throughout the North who think much as the present speaker does\r\nabout him and his enterprise. I do not hesitate to say that they are an\r\nimportant and growing party. We aspire to be something more than stupid\r\nand timid chattels, pretending to read history and our bibles, but\r\ndesecrating every house and every day we breathe in. Perhaps anxious\r\npoliticians may prove that only seventeen white men and five negroes\r\nwere concerned in the late enterprise, but their very anxiety to prove\r\nthis might suggest to themselves that all is not told. Why do they\r\nstill dodge the truth? They are so anxious because of a dim\r\nconsciousness of the fact, which they do not distinctly face, that at\r\nleast a million of the free inhabitants of the United States would have\r\nrejoiced if it had succeeded. They at most only criticise the tactics.\r\nThough we wear no crape, the thought of that man’s position and\r\nprobable fate is spoiling many a man’s day here at the North for other\r\nthinking. If any one who has seen him here can pursue successfully any\r\nother train of thought, I do not know what he is made of. If there is\r\nany such who gets his usual allowance of sleep, I will warrant him to\r\nfatten easily under any circumstances which do not touch his body or\r\npurse. I put a piece of paper and a pencil under my pillow, and when I\r\ncould not sleep, I wrote in the dark.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, my respect for my fellow-men, except as one may outweigh\r\na million, is not being increased these days. I have noticed the\r\ncold-blooded way in which newspaper writers and men generally speak of\r\nthis event, as if an ordinary malefactor, though one of unusual\r\n“pluck,”—as the Governor of Virginia is reported to have said, using\r\nthe language of the cock-pit, “the gamest man he ever saw,”—had been\r\ncaught, and were about to be hung. He was not dreaming of his foes when\r\nthe governor thought he looked so brave. It turns what sweetness I have\r\nto gall, to hear, or hear of, the remarks of some of my neighbors. When\r\nwe heard at first that he was dead, one of my townsmen observed that\r\n“he died as the fool dieth”; which, pardon me, for an instant suggested\r\na likeness in him dying to my neighbor living. Others, craven-hearted,\r\nsaid disparagingly, that “he threw his life away,” because he resisted\r\nthe government. Which way have they thrown _their_ lives, pray?—Such as\r\nwould praise a man for attacking singly an ordinary band of thieves or\r\nmurderers. I hear another ask, Yankee-like, “What will he gain by it?”\r\nas if he expected to fill his pockets by this enterprise. Such a one\r\nhas no idea of gain but in this worldly sense. If it does not lead to a\r\n“surprise” party, if he does not get a new pair of boots, or a vote of\r\nthanks, it must be a failure. “But he won’t gain anything by it.” Well,\r\nno, I don’t suppose he could get four-and-sixpence a day for being\r\nhung, take the year round; but then he stands a chance to save a\r\nconsiderable part of his soul,—and _such_ a soul!—when _you_ do not. No\r\ndoubt you can get more in your market for a quart of milk than for a\r\nquart of blood, but that is not the market that heroes carry their\r\nblood to.\r\n\r\nSuch do not know that like the seed is the fruit, and that, in the\r\nmoral world, when good seed is planted, good fruit is inevitable, and\r\ndoes not depend on our watering and cultivating; that when you plant,\r\nor bury, a hero in his field, a crop of heroes is sure to spring up.\r\nThis is a seed of such force and vitality, that it does not ask our\r\nleave to germinate.\r\n\r\nThe momentary charge at Balaclava, in obedience to a blundering\r\ncommand, proving what a perfect machine the soldier is, has, properly\r\nenough, been celebrated by a poet laureate; but the steady, and for the\r\nmost part successful, charge of this man, for some years, against the\r\nlegions of Slavery, in obedience to an infinitely higher command, is as\r\nmuch more memorable than that, as an intelligent and conscientious man\r\nis superior to a machine. Do you think that that will go unsung?\r\n\r\n“Served him right”—“A dangerous man”—“He is undoubtedly insane.” So\r\nthey proceed to live their sane, and wise, and altogether admirable\r\nlives, reading their Plutarch a little, but chiefly pausing at that\r\nfeat of Putnam, who was let down into a wolf’s den; and in this wise\r\nthey nourish themselves for brave and patriotic deeds some time or\r\nother. The Tract Society could afford to print that story of Putnam.\r\nYou might open the district schools with the reading of it, for there\r\nis nothing about Slavery or the Church in it; unless it occurs to the\r\nreader that some pastors are _wolves_ in sheep’s clothing. “The\r\nAmerican Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions” even, might dare\r\nto protest against _that_ wolf. I have heard of boards, and of American\r\nboards, but it chances that I never heard of this particular lumber\r\ntill lately. And yet I hear of Northern men, and women, and children,\r\nby families, buying a “life membership” in such societies as these. A\r\nlife-membership in the grave! You can get buried cheaper than that.\r\n\r\nOur foes are in our midst and all about us. There is hardly a house but\r\nis divided against itself, for our foe is the all but universal\r\nwoodenness of both head and heart, the want of vitality in man, which\r\nis the effect of our vice; and hence are begotten fear, superstition,\r\nbigotry, persecution, and slavery of all kinds. We are mere\r\nfigure-heads upon a hulk, with livers in the place of hearts. The curse\r\nis the worship of idols, which at length changes the worshipper into a\r\nstone image himself; and the New Englander is just as much an idolater\r\nas the Hindoo. This man was an exception, for he did not set up even a\r\npolitical graven image between him and his God.\r\n\r\nA church that can never have done with excommunicating Christ while it\r\nexists! Away with your broad and flat churches, and your narrow and\r\ntall churches! Take a step forward, and invent a new style of\r\nout-houses. Invent a salt that will save you, and defend our nostrils.\r\n\r\nThe modern Christian is a man who has consented to say all the prayers\r\nin the liturgy, provided you will let him go straight to bed and sleep\r\nquietly afterward. All his prayers begin with “Now I lay me down to\r\nsleep,” and he is forever looking forward to the time when he shall go\r\nto his “_long_ rest.” He has consented to perform certain old\r\nestablished charities, too, after a fashion, but he does not wish to\r\nhear of any new-fangled ones; he doesn’t wish to have any supplementary\r\narticles added to the contract, to fit it to the present time. He shows\r\nthe whites of his eyes on the Sabbath, and the blacks all the rest of\r\nthe week. The evil is not merely a stagnation of blood, but a\r\nstagnation of spirit. Many, no doubt, are well disposed, but sluggish\r\nby constitution and by habit, and they cannot conceive of a man who is\r\nactuated by higher motives than they are. Accordingly they pronounce\r\nthis man insane, for they know that _they_ could never act as he does,\r\nas long as they are themselves.\r\n\r\nWe dream of foreign countries, of other times and races of men, placing\r\nthem at a distance in history or space; but let some significant event\r\nlike the present occur in our midst, and we discover, often, this\r\ndistance and this strangeness between us and our nearest neighbors.\r\n_They_ are our Austrias, and Chinas, and South Sea Islands. Our crowded\r\nsociety becomes well spaced all at once, clean and handsome to the eye,\r\na city of magnificent distances. We discover why it was that we never\r\ngot beyond compliments and surfaces with them before; we become aware\r\nof as many versts between us and them as there are between a wandering\r\nTartar and a Chinese town. The thoughtful man becomes a hermit in the\r\nthoroughfares of the market-place. Impassable seas suddenly find their\r\nlevel between us, or dumb steppes stretch themselves out there. It is\r\nthe difference of constitution, of intelligence, and faith, and not\r\nstreams and mountains, that make the true and impassable boundaries\r\nbetween individuals and between states. None but the like-minded can\r\ncome plenipotentiary to our court.\r\n\r\nI read all the newspapers I could get within a week after this event,\r\nand I do not remember in them a single expression of sympathy for these\r\nmen. I have since seen one noble statement, in a Boston paper, not\r\neditorial. Some voluminous sheets decided not to print the full report\r\nof Brown’s words to the exclusion of other matter. It was as if a\r\npublisher should reject the manuscript of the New Testament, and print\r\nWilson’s last speech. The same journal which contained this pregnant\r\nnews, was chiefly filled, in parallel columns, with the reports of the\r\npolitical conventions that were being held. But the descent to them was\r\ntoo steep. They should have been spared this contrast, been printed in\r\nan extra at least. To turn from the voices and deeds of earnest men to\r\nthe _cackling_ of political conventions! Office seekers and\r\nspeech-makers, who do not so much as lay an honest egg, but wear their\r\nbreasts bare upon an egg of chalk! Their great game is the game of\r\nstraws, or rather that universal aboriginal game of the platter, at\r\nwhich the Indians cried _hub, bub!_ Exclude the reports of religious\r\nand political conventions, and publish the words of a living man.\r\n\r\nBut I object not so much to what they have omitted, as to what they\r\nhave inserted. Even the _Liberator_ called it “a misguided, wild, and\r\napparently insane ... effort.” As for the herd of newspapers and\r\nmagazines, I do not chance to know an editor in the country who will\r\ndeliberately print anything which he knows will ultimately and\r\npermanently reduce the number of his subscribers. They do not believe\r\nthat it would be expedient. How then can they print truth? If we do not\r\nsay pleasant things, they argue, nobody will attend to us. And so they\r\ndo like some travelling auctioneers, who sing an obscene song in order\r\nto draw a crowd around them. Republican editors, obliged to get their\r\nsentences ready for the morning edition, and accustomed to look at\r\neverything by the twilight of politics, express no admiration, nor true\r\nsorrow even, but call these men “deluded fanatics”—“mistaken\r\nmen”—“insane,” or “crazed.” It suggests what a _sane_ set of editors we\r\nare blessed with, _not_ “mistaken men”; who know very well on which\r\nside their bread is buttered, at least.\r\n\r\nA man does a brave and humane deed, and at once, on all sides, we hear\r\npeople and parties declaring, “I didn’t do it, nor countenance _him_ to\r\ndo it, in any conceivable way. It can’t be fairly inferred from my past\r\ncareer.” I, for one, am not interested to hear you define your\r\nposition. I don’t know that I ever was, or ever shall be. I think it is\r\nmere egotism, or impertinent at this time. Ye needn’t take so much\r\npains to wash your skirts of him. No intelligent man will ever be\r\nconvinced that he was any creature of yours. He went and came, as he\r\nhimself informs us, “under the auspices of John Brown and nobody else.”\r\nThe Republican party does not perceive how many his _failure_ will make\r\nto vote more correctly than they would have them. They have counted the\r\nvotes of Pennsylvania & Co., but they have not correctly counted\r\nCaptain Brown’s vote. He has taken the wind out of their sails, the\r\nlittle wind they had, and they may as well lie to and repair.\r\n\r\nWhat though he did not belong to your clique! Though you may not\r\napprove of his method or his principles, recognize his magnanimity.\r\nWould you not like to claim kindredship with him in that, though in no\r\nother thing he is like, or likely, to you? Do you think that you would\r\nlose your reputation so? What you lost at the spile, you would gain at\r\nthe bung.\r\n\r\nIf they do not mean all this, then they do not speak the truth, and say\r\nwhat they mean. They are simply at their old tricks still.\r\n\r\n“It was always conceded to him,” _says one who calls him crazy_, “that\r\nhe was a conscientious man, very modest in his demeanor, apparently\r\ninoffensive, until the subject of Slavery was introduced, when he would\r\nexhibit a feeling of indignation unparalleled.”\r\n\r\nThe slave-ship is on her way, crowded with its dying victims; new\r\ncargoes are being added in mid ocean; a small crew of slaveholders,\r\ncountenanced by a large body of passengers, is smothering four millions\r\nunder the hatches, and yet the politician asserts that the only proper\r\nway by which deliverance is to be obtained, is by “the quiet diffusion\r\nof the sentiments of humanity,” without any “outbreak.” As if the\r\nsentiments of humanity were ever found unaccompanied by its deeds, and\r\nyou could disperse them, all finished to order, the pure article, as\r\neasily as water with a watering-pot, and so lay the dust. What is that\r\nthat I hear cast overboard? The bodies of the dead that have found\r\ndeliverance. That is the way we are “diffusing” humanity, and its\r\nsentiments with it.\r\n\r\nProminent and influential editors, accustomed to deal with politicians,\r\nmen of an infinitely lower grade, say, in their ignorance, that he\r\nacted “on the principle of revenge.” They do not know the man. They\r\nmust enlarge themselves to conceive of him. I have no doubt that the\r\ntime will come when they will begin to see him as he was. They have got\r\nto conceive of a man of faith and of religious principle, and not a\r\npolitician or an Indian; of a man who did not wait till he was\r\npersonally interfered with, or thwarted in some harmless business,\r\nbefore he gave his life to the cause of the oppressed.\r\n\r\nIf Walker may be considered the representative of the South, I wish I\r\ncould say that Brown was the representative of the North. He was a\r\nsuperior man. He did not value his bodily life in comparison with ideal\r\nthings. He did not recognize unjust human laws, but resisted them as he\r\nwas bid. For once we are lifted out of the trivialness and dust of\r\npolitics into the region of truth and manhood. No man in America has\r\never stood up so persistently and effectively for the dignity of human\r\nnature, knowing himself for a man, and the equal of any and all\r\ngovernments. In that sense he was the most American of us all. He\r\nneeded no babbling lawyer, making false issues, to defend him. He was\r\nmore than a match for all the judges that American voters, or\r\noffice-holders of whatever grade, can create. He could not have been\r\ntried by a jury of his peers, because his peers did not exist. When a\r\nman stands up serenely against the condemnation and vengeance of\r\nmankind, rising above them literally _by a whole body_,—even though he\r\nwere of late the vilest murderer, who has settled that matter with\r\nhimself,—the spectacle is a sublime one,—didn’t ye know it, ye\r\nLiberators, ye Tribunes, ye Republicans?—and we become criminal in\r\ncomparison. Do yourselves the honor to recognize him. He needs none of\r\nyour respect.\r\n\r\nAs for the Democratic journals, they are not human enough to affect me\r\nat all. I do not feel indignation at anything they may say.\r\n\r\nI am aware that I anticipate a little, that he was still, at the last\r\naccounts, alive in the hands of his foes; but that being the case, I\r\nhave all along found myself thinking and speaking of him as physically\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in erecting statues to those who still live in our\r\nhearts, whose bones have not yet crumbled in the earth around us, but I\r\nwould rather see the statue of Captain Brown in the Massachusetts\r\nState-House yard, than that of any other man whom I know. I rejoice\r\nthat I live in this age, that I am his contemporary.\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast, when we turn to that political party which is so\r\nanxiously shuffling him and his plot out of its way, and looking around\r\nfor some available slaveholder, perhaps, to be its candidate, at least\r\nfor one who will execute the Fugitive Slave Law, and all those other\r\nunjust laws which he took up arms to annul!\r\n\r\nInsane! A father and six sons, and one son-in-law, and several more men\r\nbesides,—as many at least as twelve disciples,—all struck with insanity\r\nat once; while the same tyrant holds with a firmer gripe than ever his\r\nfour millions of slaves, and a thousand sane editors, his abettors, are\r\nsaving their country and their bacon! Just as insane were his efforts\r\nin Kansas. Ask the tyrant who is his most dangerous foe, the sane man\r\nor the insane? Do the thousands who know him best, who have rejoiced at\r\nhis deeds in Kansas, and have afforded him material aid there, think\r\nhim insane? Such a use of this word is a mere trope with most who\r\npersist in using it, and I have no doubt that many of the rest have\r\nalready in silence retracted their words.\r\n\r\nRead his admirable answers to Mason and others. How they are dwarfed\r\nand defeated by the contrast! On the one side, half brutish, half timid\r\nquestioning; on the other, truth, clear as lightning, crashing into\r\ntheir obscene temples. They are made to stand with Pilate, and Gessler,\r\nand the Inquisition. How ineffectual their speech and action! and what\r\na void their silence! They are but helpless tools in this great work.\r\nIt was no human power that gathered them about this preacher.\r\n\r\nWhat have Massachusetts and the North sent a few _sane_ representatives\r\nto Congress for, of late years?—to declare with effect what kind of\r\nsentiments? All their speeches put together and boiled down,—and\r\nprobably they themselves will confess it,—do not match for manly\r\ndirectness and force, and for simple truth, the few casual remarks of\r\ncrazy John Brown, on the floor of the Harper’s Ferry engine-house,—that\r\nman whom you are about to hang, to send to the other world, though not\r\nto represent _you_ there. No, he was not our representative in any\r\nsense. He was too fair a specimen of a man to represent the like of us.\r\nWho, then, _were_ his constituents? If you read his words\r\nunderstandingly you will find out. In his case there is no idle\r\neloquence, no made, nor maiden speech, no compliments to the oppressor.\r\nTruth is his inspirer, and earnestness the polisher of his sentences.\r\nHe could afford to lose his Sharp’s rifles, while he retained his\r\nfaculty of speech,—a Sharp’s rifle of infinitely surer and longer\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nAnd the _New York Herald_ reports the conversation _verbatim!_ It does\r\nnot know of what undying words it is made the vehicle.\r\n\r\nI have no respect for the penetration of any man who can read the\r\nreport of that conversation, and still call the principal in it insane.\r\nIt has the ring of a saner sanity than an ordinary discipline and\r\nhabits of life, than an ordinary organization, secure. Take any\r\nsentence of it—“Any questions that I can honorably answer, I will; not\r\notherwise. So far as I am myself concerned, I have told everything\r\ntruthfully. I value my word, sir.” The few who talk about his\r\nvindictive spirit, while they really admire his heroism, have no test\r\nby which to detect a noble man, no amalgam to combine with his pure\r\ngold. They mix their own dross with it.\r\n\r\nIt is a relief to turn from these slanders to the testimony of his more\r\ntruthful, but frightened, jailers and hangmen. Governor Wise speaks far\r\nmore justly and appreciatingly of him than any Northern editor, or\r\npolitician, or public personage, that I chance to have heard from. I\r\nknow that you can afford to hear him again on this subject. He says:\r\n“They are themselves mistaken who take him to be a madman.... He is\r\ncool, collected, and indomitable, and it is but just to him to say,\r\nthat he was humane to his prisoners.... And he inspired me with great\r\ntrust in his integrity as a man of truth. He is a fanatic, vain and\r\ngarrulous,” (I leave that part to Mr. Wise) “but firm, truthful, and\r\nintelligent. His men, too, who survive, are like him.... Colonel\r\nWashington says that he was the coolest and firmest man he ever saw in\r\ndefying danger and death. With one son dead by his side, and another\r\nshot through, he felt the pulse of his dying son with one hand, and\r\nheld his rifle with the other, and commanded his men with the utmost\r\ncomposure, encouraging them to be firm, and to sell their lives as dear\r\nas they could. Of the three white prisoners, Brown, Stephens, and\r\nCoppoc, it was hard to say which was most firm....”\r\n\r\nAlmost the first Northern men whom the slaveholder has learned to\r\nrespect!\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Mr. Vallandigham, though less valuable, is of the same\r\npurport, that “it is vain to underrate either the man or his\r\nconspiracy.... He is the farthest possible removed from the ordinary\r\nruffian, fanatic, or madman.”\r\n\r\n“All is quiet at Harper’s Ferry,” say the journals. What is the\r\ncharacter of that calm which follows when the law and the slaveholder\r\nprevail? I regard this event as a touchstone designed to bring out,\r\nwith glaring distinctness, the character of this government. We needed\r\nto be thus assisted to see it by the light of history. It needed to see\r\nitself. When a government puts forth its strength on the side of\r\ninjustice, as ours to maintain Slavery and kill the liberators of the\r\nslave, it reveals itself a merely brute force, or worse, a demoniacal\r\nforce. It is the head of the Plug Uglies. It is more manifest than ever\r\nthat tyranny rules. I see this government to be effectually allied with\r\nFrance and Austria in oppressing mankind. There sits a tyrant holding\r\nfettered four millions of slaves; here comes their heroic liberator.\r\nThis most hypocritical and diabolical government looks up from its seat\r\non the gasping four millions, and inquires with an assumption of\r\ninnocence: “What do you assault me for? Am I not an honest man? Cease\r\nagitation on this subject, or I will make a slave of you, too, or else\r\nhang you.”\r\n\r\nWe talk about a _representative_ government; but what a monster of a\r\ngovernment is that where the noblest faculties of the mind, and the\r\n_whole_ heart, are not _represented_. A semi-human tiger or ox,\r\nstalking over the earth, with its heart taken out and the top of its\r\nbrain shot away. Heroes have fought well on their stumps when their\r\nlegs were shot off, but I never heard of any good done by such a\r\ngovernment as that.\r\n\r\nThe only government that I recognize,—and it matters not how few are at\r\nthe head of it, or how small its army,—is that power that establishes\r\njustice in the land, never that which establishes injustice. What shall\r\nwe think of a government to which all the truly brave and just men in\r\nthe land are enemies, standing between it and those whom it oppresses?\r\nA government that pretends to be Christian and crucifies a million\r\nChrists every day!\r\n\r\nTreason! Where does such treason take its rise? I cannot help thinking\r\nof you as you deserve, ye governments. Can you dry up the fountains of\r\nthought? High treason, when it is resistance to tyranny here below, has\r\nits origin in, and is first committed by, the power that makes and\r\nforever recreates man. When you have caught and hung all these human\r\nrebels, you have accomplished nothing but your own guilt, for you have\r\nnot struck at the fountain head. You presume to contend with a foe\r\nagainst whom West Point cadets and rifled cannon _point_ not. Can all\r\nthe art of the cannon-founder tempt matter to turn against its maker?\r\nIs the form in which the founder thinks he casts it more essential than\r\nthe constitution of it and of himself?\r\n\r\nThe United States have a coffle of four millions of slaves. They are\r\ndetermined to keep them in this condition; and Massachusetts is one of\r\nthe confederated overseers to prevent their escape. Such are not all\r\nthe inhabitants of Massachusetts, but such are they who rule and are\r\nobeyed here. It was Massachusetts, as well as Virginia, that put down\r\nthis insurrection at Harper’s Ferry. She sent the marines there, and\r\nshe will have to pay the penalty of her sin.\r\n\r\nSuppose that there is a society in this State that out of its own purse\r\nand magnanimity saves all the fugitive slaves that run to us, and\r\nprotects our colored fellow-citizens, and leaves the other work to the\r\ngovernment, so-called. Is not that government fast losing its\r\noccupation, and becoming contemptible to mankind? If private men are\r\nobliged to perform the offices of government, to protect the weak and\r\ndispense justice, then the government becomes only a hired man, or\r\nclerk, to perform menial or indifferent services. Of course, that is\r\nbut the shadow of a government whose existence necessitates a Vigilant\r\nCommittee. What should we think of the oriental Cadi even, behind whom\r\nworked in secret a Vigilant Committee? But such is the character of our\r\nNorthern States generally; each has its Vigilant Committee. And, to a\r\ncertain extent, these crazy governments recognize and accept this\r\nrelation. They say, virtually, “We’ll be glad to work for you on these\r\nterms, only don’t make a noise about it.” And thus the government, its\r\nsalary being insured, withdraws into the back shop, taking the\r\nConstitution with it, and bestows most of its labor on repairing that.\r\nWhen I hear it at work sometimes, as I go by, it reminds me, at best,\r\nof those farmers who in winter contrive to turn a penny by following\r\nthe coopering business. And what kind of spirit is their barrel made to\r\nhold? They speculate in stocks, and bore holes in mountains, but they\r\nare not competent to lay out even a decent highway. The only _free_\r\nroad, the Underground Railroad, is owned and managed by the Vigilant\r\nCommittee. _They_ have tunnelled under the whole breadth of the land.\r\nSuch a government is losing its power and respectability as surely as\r\nwater runs out of a leaky vessel, and is held by one that can contain\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI hear many condemn these men because they were so few. When were the\r\ngood and the brave ever in a majority? Would you have had him wait till\r\nthat time came?—till you and I came over to him? The very fact that he\r\nhad no rabble or troop of hirelings about him would alone distinguish\r\nhim from ordinary heroes. His company was small indeed, because few\r\ncould be found worthy to pass muster. Each one who there laid down his\r\nlife for the poor and oppressed was a picked man, culled out of many\r\nthousands, if not millions; apparently a man of principle, of rare\r\ncourage, and devoted humanity, ready to sacrifice his life at any\r\nmoment for the benefit of his fellow man. It may be doubted if there\r\nwere as many more their equals in these respects in all the country—I\r\nspeak of his followers only—for their leader, no doubt, scoured the\r\nland far and wide, seeking to swell his troop. These alone were ready\r\nto step between the oppressor and the oppressed. Surely they were the\r\nvery best men you could select to be hung. That was the greatest\r\ncompliment which this country could pay them. They were ripe for her\r\ngallows. She has tried a long time, she has hung a good many, but never\r\nfound the right one before.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of him, and his six sons, and his son-in-law, not to\r\nenumerate the others, enlisted for this fight, proceeding coolly,\r\nreverently, humanely to work, for months if not years, sleeping and\r\nwaking upon it, summering and wintering the thought, without expecting\r\nany reward but a good conscience, while almost all America stood ranked\r\non the other side—I say again that it affects me as a sublime\r\nspectacle. If he had had any journal advocating “_his cause_,” any\r\norgan, as the phrase is, monotonously and wearisomely playing the same\r\nold tune, and then passing round the hat, it would have been fatal to\r\nhis efficiency. If he had acted in any way so as to be let alone by the\r\ngovernment, he might have been suspected. It was the fact that the\r\ntyrant must give place to him, or he to the tyrant, that distinguished\r\nhim from all the reformers of the day that I know.\r\n\r\nIt was his peculiar doctrine that a man has a perfect right to\r\ninterfere by force with the slaveholder, in order to rescue the slave.\r\nI agree with him. They who are continually shocked by slavery have some\r\nright to be shocked by the violent death of the slaveholder, but no\r\nothers. Such will be more shocked by his life than by his death. I\r\nshall not be forward to think him mistaken in his method who quickest\r\nsucceeds to liberate the slave. I speak for the slave when I say, that\r\nI prefer the philanthropy of Captain Brown to that philanthropy which\r\nneither shoots me nor liberates me. At any rate, I do not think it is\r\nquite sane for one to spend his whole life in talking or writing about\r\nthis matter, unless he is continuously inspired, and I have not done\r\nso. A man may have other affairs to attend to. I do not wish to kill\r\nnor to be killed, but I can foresee circumstances in which both these\r\nthings would be by me unavoidable. We preserve the so-called peace of\r\nour community by deeds of petty violence every day. Look at the\r\npoliceman’s billy and handcuffs! Look at the jail! Look at the gallows!\r\nLook at the chaplain of the regiment! We are hoping only to live safely\r\non the outskirts of _this_ provisional army. So we defend ourselves and\r\nour hen-roosts, and maintain slavery. I know that the mass of my\r\ncountrymen think that the only righteous use that can be made of\r\nSharp’s rifles and revolvers is to fight duels with them, when we are\r\ninsulted by other nations, or to hunt Indians, or shoot fugitive slaves\r\nwith them, or the like. I think that for once the Sharp’s rifles and\r\nthe revolvers were employed in a righteous cause. The tools were in the\r\nhands of one who could use them.\r\n\r\nThe same indignation that is said to have cleared the temple once will\r\nclear it again. The question is not about the weapon, but the spirit in\r\nwhich you use it. No man has appeared in America, as yet, who loved his\r\nfellow man so well, and treated him so tenderly. He lived for him. He\r\ntook up his life and he laid it down for him. What sort of violence is\r\nthat which is encouraged, not by soldiers, but by peaceable citizens,\r\nnot so much by laymen as by ministers of the gospel, not so much by the\r\nfighting sects as by the Quakers, and not so much by Quaker men as by\r\nQuaker women?\r\n\r\nThis event advertises me that there is such a fact as death—the\r\npossibility of a man’s dying. It seems as if no man had ever died in\r\nAmerica before; for in order to die you must first have lived. I don’t\r\nbelieve in the hearses, and palls, and funerals that they have had.\r\nThere was no death in the case, because there had been no life; they\r\nmerely rotted or sloughed off, pretty much as they had rotted or\r\nsloughed along. No temple’s veil was rent, only a hole dug somewhere.\r\nLet the dead bury their dead. The best of them fairly ran down like a\r\nclock. Franklin,—Washington,—they were let off without dying; they were\r\nmerely missing one day. I hear a good many pretend that they are going\r\nto die; or that they have died, for aught that I know. Nonsense! I’ll\r\ndefy them to do it. They haven’t got life enough in them. They’ll\r\ndeliquesce like fungi, and keep a hundred eulogists mopping the spot\r\nwhere they left off. Only half a dozen or so have died since the world\r\nbegan. Do you think that you are going to die, sir? No! there’s no hope\r\nof you. You haven’t got your lesson yet. You’ve got to stay after\r\nschool. We make a needless ado about capital punishment,—taking lives,\r\nwhen there is no life to take. _Memento mori!_ We don’t understand that\r\nsublime sentence which some worthy got sculptured on his gravestone\r\nonce. We’ve interpreted it in a grovelling and snivelling sense; we’ve\r\nwholly forgotten how to die.\r\n\r\nBut be sure you do die nevertheless. Do your work, and finish it. If\r\nyou know how to begin, you will know when to end.\r\n\r\nThese men, in teaching us how to die, have at the same time taught us\r\nhow to live. If this man’s acts and words do not create a revival, it\r\nwill be the severest possible satire on the acts and words that do. It\r\nis the best news that America has ever heard. It has already quickened\r\nthe feeble pulse of the North, and infused more and more generous blood\r\ninto her veins and heart, than any number of years of what is called\r\ncommercial and political prosperity could. How many a man who was\r\nlately contemplating suicide has now something to live for!\r\n\r\nOne writer says that Brown’s peculiar monomania made him to be “dreaded\r\nby the Missourians as a supernatural being.” Sure enough, a hero in the\r\nmidst of us cowards is always so dreaded. He is just that thing. He\r\nshows himself superior to nature. He has a spark of divinity in him.\r\n\r\n     “Unless above himself he can\r\n     Erect himself, how poor a thing is man!”\r\n\r\nNewspaper editors argue also that it is a proof of his _insanity_ that\r\nhe thought he was appointed to do this work which he did,—that he did\r\nnot suspect himself for a moment! They talk as if it were impossible\r\nthat a man could be “divinely appointed” in these days to do any work\r\nwhatever; as if vows and religion were out of date as connected with\r\nany man’s daily work; as if the agent to abolish Slavery could only be\r\nsomebody appointed by the President, or by some political party. They\r\ntalk as if a man’s death were a failure, and his continued life, be it\r\nof whatever character, were a success.\r\n\r\nWhen I reflect to what a cause this man devoted himself, and how\r\nreligiously, and then reflect to what cause his judges and all who\r\ncondemn him so angrily and fluently devote themselves, I see that they\r\nare as far apart as the heavens and earth are asunder.\r\n\r\nThe amount of it is, our “_leading men_” are a harmless kind of folk,\r\nand they know _well enough_ that _they_ were not divinely appointed,\r\nbut elected by the votes of their party.\r\n\r\nWho is it whose safety requires that Captain Brown be hung? Is it\r\nindispensable to any Northern man? Is there no resource but to cast\r\nthese men also to the Minotaur? If you do not wish it, say so\r\ndistinctly. While these things are being done, beauty stands veiled and\r\nmusic is a screeching lie. Think of him,—of his rare qualities!—such a\r\nman as it takes ages to make, and ages to understand; no mock hero, nor\r\nthe representative of any party. A man such as the sun may not rise\r\nupon again in this benighted land. To whose making went the costliest\r\nmaterial, the finest adamant; sent to be the redeemer of those in\r\ncaptivity. And the only use to which you can put him is to hang him at\r\nthe end of a rope! You who pretend to care for Christ crucified,\r\nconsider what you are about to do to him who offered himself to be the\r\nsavior of four millions of men.\r\n\r\nAny man knows when he is justified, and all the wits in the world\r\ncannot enlighten him on that point. The murderer always knows that he\r\nis justly punished; but when a government takes the life of a man\r\nwithout the consent of his conscience, it is an audacious government,\r\nand is taking a step towards its own dissolution. Is it not possible\r\nthat an individual may be right and a government wrong? Are laws to be\r\nenforced simply because they were made? or declared by any number of\r\nmen to be good, if they are _not_ good? Is there any necessity for a\r\nman’s being a tool to perform a deed of which his better nature\r\ndisapproves? Is it the intention of law-makers that _good_ men shall be\r\nhung ever? Are judges to interpret the law according to the letter, and\r\nnot the spirit? What right have _you_ to enter into a compact with\r\nyourself that you _will_ do thus or so, against the light within you?\r\nIs it for _you_ to _make up_ your mind,—to form any resolution\r\nwhatever,—and not accept the convictions that are forced upon you, and\r\nwhich ever pass your understanding? I do not believe in lawyers, in\r\nthat mode of attacking or defending a man, because you descend to meet\r\nthe judge on his own ground, and, in cases of the highest importance,\r\nit is of no consequence whether a man breaks a human law or not. Let\r\nlawyers decide trivial cases. Business men may arrange that among\r\nthemselves. If they were the interpreters of the everlasting laws which\r\nrightfully bind man, that would be another thing. A counterfeiting\r\nlaw-factory, standing half in a slave land and half in a free! What\r\nkind of laws for free men can you expect from that?\r\n\r\nI am here to plead his cause with you. I plead not for his life, but\r\nfor his character,—his immortal life; and so it becomes your cause\r\nwholly, and is not his in the least. Some eighteen hundred years ago\r\nChrist was crucified; this morning, perchance, Captain Brown was hung.\r\nThese are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links. He is\r\nnot Old Brown any longer; he is an Angel of Light.\r\n\r\nI see now that it was necessary that the bravest and humanest man in\r\nall the country should be hung. Perhaps he saw it himself. I _almost\r\nfear_ that I may yet hear of his deliverance, doubting if a prolonged\r\nlife, if _any_ life, can do as much good as his death.\r\n\r\n“Misguided”! “Garrulous”! “Insane”! “Vindictive”! So ye write in your\r\neasy-chairs, and thus he wounded responds from the floor of the Armory,\r\nclear as a cloudless sky, true as the voice of nature is: “No man sent\r\nme here; it was my own prompting and that of my Maker. I acknowledge no\r\nmaster in human form.”\r\n\r\nAnd in what a sweet and noble strain he proceeds, addressing his\r\ncaptors, who stand over him: “I think, my friends, you are guilty of a\r\ngreat wrong against God and humanity, and it would be perfectly right\r\nfor any one to interfere with you so far as to free those you willfully\r\nand wickedly hold in bondage.”\r\n\r\nAnd referring to his movement: “It is, in my opinion, the greatest\r\nservice a man can render to God.”\r\n\r\n“I pity the poor in bondage that have none to help them; that is why I\r\nam here; not to gratify any personal animosity, revenge, or vindictive\r\nspirit. It is my sympathy with the oppressed and the wronged, that are\r\nas good as you, and as precious in the sight of God.”\r\n\r\nYou don’t know your testament when you see it.\r\n\r\n“I want you to understand that I respect the rights of the poorest and\r\nweakest of colored people, oppressed by the slave power, just as much\r\nas I do those of the most wealthy and powerful.”\r\n\r\n“I wish to say, furthermore, that you had better, all you people at the\r\nSouth, prepare yourselves for a settlement of that question, that must\r\ncome up for settlement sooner than you are prepared for it. The sooner\r\nyou are prepared the better. You may dispose of me very easily. I am\r\nnearly disposed of now; but this question is still to be settled,—this\r\nnegro question, I mean; the end of that is not yet.”\r\n\r\nI foresee the time when the painter will paint that scene, no longer\r\ngoing to Rome for a subject; the poet will sing it; the historian\r\nrecord it; and, with the Landing of the Pilgrims and the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, it will be the ornament of some future national gallery,\r\nwhen at least the present form of Slavery shall be no more here. We\r\nshall then be at liberty to weep for Captain Brown. Then, and not till\r\nthen, we will take our revenge.",
