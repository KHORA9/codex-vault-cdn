Johnson\r\nJanuary 8, 1964\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the House and Senate, my fellow\r\nAmericans:\r\n\r\nI will be brief, for our time is necessarily short and our agenda is\r\nalready long.\r\n\r\nLast year's congressional session was the longest in peacetime history.\r\nWith that foundation, let us work together to make this year's session the\r\nbest in the Nation's history.\r\n\r\nLet this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for\r\ncivil rights than the last hundred sessions combined; as the session which\r\nenacted the most far-reaching tax cut of our time; as the session which\r\ndeclared all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United\r\nStates; as the session which finally recognized the health needs of all our\r\nolder citizens; as the session which reformed our tangled transportation\r\nand transit policies; as the session which achieved the most effective,\r\nefficient foreign aid program ever; and as the session which helped to\r\nbuild more homes, more schools, more libraries, and more hospitals than any\r\nsingle session of Congress in the history of our Republic.\r\n\r\nAll this and more can and must be done. It can be done by this summer, and\r\nit can be done without any increase in spending. In fact, under the budget\r\nthat I shall shortly submit, it can be done with an actual reduction in\r\nFederal expenditures and Federal employment.\r\n\r\nWe have in 1964 a unique opportunity and obligation--to prove the success\r\nof our system; to disprove those cynics and critics at home and abroad who\r\nquestion our purpose and our competence.\r\n\r\nIf we fail, if we fritter and fumble away our opportunity in needless,\r\nsenseless quarrels between Democrats and Republicans, or between the House\r\nand the Senate, or between the South and North, or between the Congress and\r\nthe administration, then history will rightfully judge us harshly. But if\r\nwe succeed, if we can achieve these goals by forging in this country a\r\ngreater sense of union, then, and only then, can we take full satisfaction\r\nin the State of the Union. II.\r\n\r\nHere in the Congress you can demonstrate effective legislative leadership\r\nby discharging the public business with clarity and dispatch, voting each\r\nimportant proposal up, or voting it down, but at least bringing it to a\r\nfair and a final vote.\r\n\r\nLet us carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy--not\r\nbecause of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right.\r\n\r\nIn his memory today, I especially ask all members of my own political\r\nfaith, in this election year, to put your country ahead of your party, and\r\nto always debate principles; never debate personalities.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I pledge a progressive administration which is efficient, and\r\nhonest and frugal. The budget to be submitted to the Congress shortly is in\r\nfull accord with this pledge.\r\n\r\nIt will cut our deficit in half--from $10 billion to $4,900 million. It\r\nwill be, in proportion to our national output, the smallest budget since\r\n1951.\r\n\r\nIt will call for a substantial reduction in Federal employment, a feat\r\naccomplished only once before in the last 10 years. While maintaining the\r\nfull strength of our combat defenses, it will call for the lowest number of\r\ncivilian personnel in the Department of Defense since 1950.\r\n\r\nIt will call for total expenditures of $97,900 million--compared to $98,400\r\nmillion for the current year, a reduction of more than $500 million. It\r\nwill call for new obligational authority of $103,800 million--a reduction\r\nof more than $4 billion below last year's request of $107,900 million.\r\n\r\nBut it is not a standstill budget, for America cannot afford to stand\r\nstill. Our population is growing. Our economy is more complex. Our people's\r\nneeds are expanding.\r\n\r\nBut by closing down obsolete installations, by curtailing less urgent\r\nprograms, by cutting back where cutting back seems to be wise, by insisting\r\non a dollar's worth for a dollar spent, I am able to recommend in this\r\nreduced budget the most Federal support in history for education, for\r\nhealth, for retraining the unemployed, and for helping the economically and\r\nthe physically handicapped.\r\n\r\nThis budget, and this year's legislative program, are designed to help each\r\nand every American citizen fulfill his basic hopes--his hopes for a fair\r\nchance to make good; his hopes for fair play from the law; his hopes for a\r\nfull-time job on full-time pay; his hopes for a decent home for his family\r\nin a decent community; his hopes for a good school for his children with\r\ngood teachers; and his hopes for security when faced with sickness or\r\nunemployment or old age. III.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts of hope--some because\r\nof their poverty, and some because of theft color, and all too many because\r\nof both. Our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity.\r\n\r\nThis administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on\r\npoverty in America. I urge this Congress and all Americans to join with me\r\nin that effort.\r\n\r\nIt will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will\r\nsuffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won. The richest Nation on\r\nearth can afford to win it. We cannot afford to lose it. One thousand\r\ndollars invested in salvaging an unemployable youth today can return\r\n$40,000 or more in his lifetime.\r\n\r\nPoverty is a national problem, requiring improved national organization and\r\nsupport. But this attack, to be effective, must also be organized at the\r\nState and the local level and must be supported and directed by State and\r\nlocal efforts.\r\n\r\nFor the war against poverty will not be won here in Washington. It must be\r\nwon in the field, in every private home, in every public office, from the\r\ncourthouse to the White House.\r\n\r\nThe program I shall propose will emphasize this cooperative approach to\r\nhelp that one-fifth of all American families with incomes too small to even\r\nmeet their basic needs.\r\n\r\nOur chief weapons in a more pinpointed attack will be better schools, and\r\nbetter health, and better homes, and better training, and better job\r\nopportunities to help more Americans, especially young Americans, escape\r\nfrom squalor and misery and unemployment rolls where other citizens help to\r\ncarry them.\r\n\r\nVery often a lack of jobs and money is not the cause of poverty, but the\r\nsymptom. The cause may lie deeper in our failure to give our fellow\r\ncitizens a fair chance to develop their own capacities, in a lack of\r\neducation and training, in a lack of medical care and housing, in a lack of\r\ndecent communities in which to live and bring up their children.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the cause, our joint Federal-local effort must pursue poverty,\r\npursue it wherever it exists--in city slums and small towns, in\r\nsharecropper shacks or in migrant worker camps, on Indian Reservations,\r\namong whites as well as Negroes, among the young as well as the aged, in\r\nthe boom towns and in the depressed areas.\r\n\r\nOur aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and,\r\nabove all, to prevent it. No single piece of legislation, however, is going\r\nto suffice.\r\n\r\nWe will launch a special effort in the chronically distressed areas of\r\nAppalachia.\r\n\r\nWe must expand our small but our successful area redevelopment program.\r\n\r\nWe must enact youth employment legislation to put jobless, aimless,\r\nhopeless youngsters to work on useful projects.\r\n\r\nWe must distribute more food to the needy through a broader food stamp\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nWe must create a National Service Corps to help the economically\r\nhandicapped of our own country as the Peace Corps now helps those abroad.\r\n\r\nWe must modernize our unemployment insurance and establish a high-level\r\ncommission on automation. If we have the brain power to invent these\r\nmachines, we have the brain power to make certain that they are a boon and\r\nnot a bane to humanity.\r\n\r\nWe must extend the coverage of our minimum wage laws to more than 2 million\r\nworkers now lacking this basic protection of purchasing power.\r\n\r\nWe must, by including special school aid funds as part of our education\r\nprogram, improve the quality of teaching, training, and counseling in our\r\nhardest hit areas.\r\n\r\nWe must build more libraries in every area and more hospitals and nursing\r\nhomes under the Hill-Burton Act, and train more nurses to staff them.\r\n\r\nWe must provide hospital insurance for our older citizens financed by every\r\nworker and his employer under Social Security, contributing no more than $1\r\na month during the employee's working career to protect him in his old age\r\nin a dignified manner without cost to the Treasury, against the devastating\r\nhardship of prolonged or repeated illness.\r\n\r\nWe must, as a part of a revised housing and urban renewal program, give\r\nmore help to those displaced by slum clearance, provide more housing for\r\nour poor and our elderly, and seek as our ultimate goal in our free\r\nenterprise system a decent home for every American family.\r\n\r\nWe must help obtain more modern mass transit within our communities as well\r\nas low-cost transportation between them.\r\n\r\nAbove all, we must release $11 billion of tax reduction into the private\r\nspending stream to create new jobs and new markets in every area of this\r\nland. IV.\r\n\r\nThese programs are obviously not for the poor or the underprivileged alone.\r\nEvery American will benefit by the extension of social security to cover\r\nthe hospital costs of their aged parents. Every American community will\r\nbenefit from the construction or modernization of schools, libraries,\r\nhospitals, and nursing homes, from the training of more nurses and from the\r\nimprovement of urban renewal in public transit. And every individual\r\nAmerican taxpayer and every corporate taxpayer will benefit from the\r\nearliest possible passage of the pending tax bill from both the new\r\ninvestment it will bring and the new jobs that it will create.\r\n\r\nThat tax bill has been thoroughly discussed for a year. Now we need action.\r\nThe new budget clearly allows it. Our taxpayers surely deserve it. Our\r\neconomy strongly demands it. And every month of delay dilutes its benefits\r\nin 1964 for consumption, for investment, and for employment.\r\n\r\nFor until the bill is signed, its investment incentives cannot be deemed\r\ncertain, and the withholding rate cannot be reduced--and the most damaging\r\nand devastating thing you can do to any businessman in America is to keep\r\nhim in doubt and to keep him guessing on what our tax policy is. And I say\r\nthat we should now reduce to 14 percent instead of 15 percent our\r\nwithholding rate.\r\n\r\nI therefore urge the Congress to take final action on this bill by the\r\nfirst of February, if at all possible. For however proud we may be of the\r\nunprecedented progress of our free enterprise economy over the last 3\r\nyears, we should not and we cannot permit it to pause.\r\n\r\nIn 1963, for the first time in history, we crossed the 70 million job mark,\r\nbut we will soon need more than 75 million jobs. In 1963 our gross national\r\nproduct reached the $600 billion level--$100 billion higher than when we\r\ntook office. But it easily could and it should be still $30 billion higher\r\ntoday than it is.\r\n\r\nWages and profits and family income are also at their highest levels in\r\nhistory--but I would remind you that 4 million workers and 13 percent of\r\nour industrial capacity are still idle today.\r\n\r\nWe need a tax cut now to keep this country moving. V.\r\n\r\nFor our goal is not merely to spread the work. Our goal is to create more\r\njobs. I believe the enactment of a 35-hour week would sharply increase\r\ncosts, would invite inflation, would impair our ability to compete, and\r\nmerely share instead of creating employment. But I am equally opposed to\r\nthe 45- or 50-hour week in those industries where consistently excessive\r\nuse of overtime causes increased unemployment.\r\n\r\nSo, therefore, I recommend legislation authorizing the creation of a\r\ntripartite industry committee to determine on an industry-by-industry basis\r\nas to where a higher penalty rate for overtime would increase job openings\r\nwithout unduly increasing costs, and authorizing the establishment of such\r\nhigher rates. VI.\r\n\r\nLet me make one principle of this administration abundantly clear: All of\r\nthese increased opportunities--in employment, in education, in housing, and\r\nin every field--must be open to Americans of every color. As far as the writ\r\nof Federal law will run, we must abolish not some, but all racial\r\ndiscrimination. For this is not merely an economic issue, or a social,\r\npolitical, or international issue. It is a moral issue, and it must be met\r\nby the passage this session of the bill now pending in the House.\r\n\r\nAll members of the public should have equal access to facilities open to\r\nthe public. All members of the public should be equally eligible for\r\nFederal benefits that are financed by the public. All members of the public\r\nshould have an equal chance to vote for public officials and to send their\r\nchildren to good public schools and to contribute their talents to the\r\npublic good.\r\n\r\nToday, Americans of all races stand side by side in Berlin and in Viet Nam.\r\nThey died side by side in Korea. Surely they can work and eat and travel\r\nside by side in their own country. VII.\r\n\r\nWe must also lift by legislation the bars of discrimination against those\r\nwho seek entry into our country, particularly those who have much needed\r\nskills and those joining their families.\r\n\r\nIn establishing preferences, a nation that was built by the immigrants of\r\nall lands can ask those who now seek admission: \"What can you do for our\r\ncountry?\" But we should not be asking: \"In what country were you born?\"\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nFor our ultimate goal is a world without war, a world made safe for\r\ndiversity, in which all men, goods, and ideas can freely move across every\r\nborder and every boundary.\r\n\r\nWe must advance toward this goal in 1964 in at least 10 different ways, not\r\nas partisans, but as patriots.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must maintain--and our reduced defense budget will maintain--that\r\nmargin of military safety and superiority obtained through 3 years of\r\nsteadily increasing both the quality and the quantity of our strategic, our\r\nconventional, and our antiguerilla forces. In 1964 we will be better\r\nprepared than ever before to defend the cause of freedom, whether it is\r\nthreatened by outright aggression or by the infiltration practiced by those\r\nin Hanoi and Havana, who ship arms and men across international borders to\r\nfoment insurrection. And we must continue to use that strength as John\r\nKennedy used it in the Cuban crisis and for the test ban treaty--to\r\ndemonstrate both the futility of nuclear war and the possibilities of\r\nlasting peace.\r\n\r\nSecond, we must take new steps--and we shall make new proposals at\r\nGeneva--toward the control and the eventual abolition of arms. Even in the\r\nabsence of agreement, we must not stockpile arms beyond our needs or seek\r\nan excess of military power that could be provocative as well as wasteful.\r\n\r\nIt is in this spirit that in this fiscal year we are cutting back our\r\nproduction of enriched uranium by 25 percent. We are shutting down four\r\nplutonium piles. We are closing many nonessential military installations.\r\nAnd it is in this spirit that we today call on our adversaries to do the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThird, we must make increased use of our food as an instrument of\r\npeace--making it available by sale or trade or loan or donation--to hungry\r\npeople in all nations which tell us of their needs and accept proper\r\nconditions of distribution.\r\n\r\nFourth, we must assure our pre-eminence in the peaceful exploration of\r\nouter space, focusing on an expedition to the moon in this decade--in\r\ncooperation with other powers if possible, alone if necessary.\r\n\r\nFifth, we must expand world trade. Having recognized in the Act of 1962\r\nthat we must buy as well as sell, we now expect our trading partners to\r\nrecognize that we must sell as well as buy. We are willing to give them\r\ncompetitive access to our market, asking only that they do the same for\r\nus.\r\n\r\nSixth, we must continue, through such measures as the interest equalization\r\ntax, as well as the cooperation of other nations, our recent progress\r\ntoward balancing our international accounts.\r\n\r\nThis administration must and will preserve the present gold value of the\r\ndollar.\r\n\r\nSeventh, we must become better neighbors with the free states of the\r\nAmericas, working with the councils of the OAS, with a stronger Alliance\r\nfor Progress, and with all the men and women of this hemisphere who really\r\nbelieve in liberty and justice for all.\r\n\r\nEighth, we must strengthen the ability of free nations everywhere to\r\ndevelop their independence and raise their standard of living, and thereby\r\nfrustrate those who prey on poverty and chaos. To do this, the rich must\r\nhelp the poor--and we must do our part. We must achieve a more rigorous\r\nadministration of our development assistance, with larger roles for private\r\ninvestors, for other industrialized nations, and for international agencies\r\nand for the recipient nations themselves.\r\n\r\nNinth, we must strengthen our Atlantic and Pacific partnerships, maintain\r\nour alliances and make the United Nations a more effective instrument for\r\nnational independence and international order.\r\n\r\nTenth, and finally, we must develop with our allies new means of bridging\r\nthe gap between the East and the West, facing danger boldly wherever danger\r\nexists, but being equally bold in our search for new agreements which can\r\nenlarge the hopes of all, while violating the interests of none.\r\n\r\nIn short, I would say to the Congress that we must be constantly prepared\r\nfor the worst, and constantly acting for the best. We must be strong enough\r\nto win any war, and we must be wise enough to prevent one.\r\n\r\nWe shall neither act as aggressors nor tolerate acts of aggression. We\r\nintend to bury no one, and we do not intend to be buried.\r\n\r\nWe can fight, if we must, as we have fought before, but we pray that we\r\nwill never have to fight again. IX.\r\n\r\nMy good friends and my fellow Americans: In these last 7 sorrowful weeks,\r\nwe have learned anew that nothing is so enduring as faith, and nothing is\r\nso degrading as hate.\r\n\r\nJohn Kennedy was a victim of hate, but he was also a great builder of\r\nfaith--faith in our fellow Americans, whatever their creed or their color\r\nor their station in life; faith in the future of man, whatever his\r\ndivisions and differences.\r\n\r\nThis faith was echoed in all parts of the world. On every continent and in\r\nevery land to which Mrs. Johnson and I traveled, we found faith and hope\r\nand love toward this land of America and toward our people.\r\n\r\nSo I ask you now in the Congress and in the country to join with me in\r\nexpressing and fulfilling that faith in working for a nation, a nation that\r\nis free from want and a world that is free from hate--a world of peace and\r\njustice, and freedom and abundance, for our time and for all time to come.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nLyndon B. Johnson\r\nJanuary 4, 1965\r\n\r\nOn this Hill which was my home, I am stirred by old friendships.\r\n\r\nThough total agreement between the Executive and the Congress is\r\nimpossible, total respect is important.\r\n\r\nI am proud to be among my colleagues of the Congress whose legacy to their\r\ntrust is their loyalty to their Nation.\r\n\r\nI am not unaware of the inner emotions of the new Members of this body\r\ntonight.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight years ago, I felt as you do now. You will soon learn that you\r\nare among men whose first love is their country, men who try each day to do\r\nas best they can what they believe is right.\r\n\r\nWe are entering the third century of the pursuit of American union.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years ago, in 1765, nine assembled colonies first joined\r\ntogether to demand freedom from arbitrary power.\r\n\r\nFor the first century we struggled to hold together the first continental\r\nunion of democracy in the history of man. One hundred years ago, in 1865,\r\nfollowing a terrible test of blood and fire, the compact of union was\r\nfinally sealed.\r\n\r\nFor a second century we labored to establish a unity of purpose and\r\ninterest among the many groups which make up the American community.\r\n\r\nThat struggle has often brought pain and violence. It is not yet over. But\r\nwe have achieved a unity of interest among our people that is unmatched in\r\nthe history of freedom.\r\n\r\nAnd so tonight, now, in 1965, we begin a new quest for union. We seek the\r\nunity of man with the world that he has built--with the knowledge that can\r\nsave or destroy him--with the cities which can stimulate or stifle\r\nhim--with the wealth and the machines which can enrich or menace his\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nWe seek to establish a harmony between man and society which will allow\r\neach of us to enlarge the meaning of his life and all of us to elevate the\r\nquality of our civilization. This is the search that we begin tonight.\r\n\r\nSTATE OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\nBut the unity we seek cannot realize its full promise in\r\nisolation. For today the state of the Union depends, in large measure, upon\r\nthe state of the world.\r\n\r\nOur concern and interest, compassion and vigilance, extend to every corner\r\nof a dwindling planet.\r\n\r\nYet, it is not merely our concern but the concern of all free men. We will\r\nnot, and we should not, assume that it is the task of Americans alone to\r\nsettle all the conflicts of a torn and troubled world.\r\n\r\nLet the foes of freedom take no comfort from this. For in concert with\r\nother nations, we shall help men defend their freedom.\r\n\r\nOur first aim remains the safety and the well-being of our own country.\r\n\r\nWe are prepared to live as good neighbors with all, but we cannot be\r\nindifferent to acts designed to injure our interests, or our citizens, or\r\nour establishments abroad. The community of nations requires mutual\r\nrespect. We shall extend it--and we shall expect it.\r\n\r\nIn our relations with the world we shall follow the example of Andrew\r\nJackson who said: \"I intend to ask for nothing that is not clearly right\r\nand to submit to nothing that is wrong.\" And he promised, that \"the honor\r\nof my country shall never be stained by an apology from me for the\r\nstatement of truth or for the performance of duty.\" That was this Nation's\r\npolicy in the 1830's and that is this Nation's policy in the 1960's.\r\n\r\nOur own freedom and growth have never been the final goal of the American\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nWe were never meant to be an oasis of liberty and abundance in a worldwide\r\ndesert of disappointed dreams. Our Nation was created to help strike away\r\nthe chains of ignorance and misery and tyranny wherever they keep man less\r\nthan God means him to be.\r\n\r\nWe are moving toward that destiny, never more rapidly than we have moved in\r\nthe last 4 years.\r\n\r\nIn this period we have built a military power strong enough to meet any\r\nthreat and destroy any adversary. And that superiority will continue to\r\ngrow so long as this office is mine--and you sit on Capitol Hill.\r\n\r\nIn this period no new nation has become Communist, and the unity of the\r\nCommunist empire has begun to crumble.\r\n\r\nIn this period we have resolved in friendship our disputes with our\r\nneighbors of the hemisphere, and joined in an Alliance for Progress toward\r\neconomic growth and political democracy.\r\n\r\nIn this period we have taken more steps toward peace--including the test\r\nban treaty--than at any time since the cold war began.\r\n\r\nIn this period we have relentlessly pursued our advances toward the\r\nconquest of space.\r\n\r\nMost important of all, in this period, the United States has reemerged into\r\nthe fullness of its self-confidence and purpose. No longer are we called\r\nupon to get America moving. We are moving. No longer do we doubt our\r\nstrength or resolution. We are strong and we have proven our resolve.\r\n\r\nNo longer can anyone wonder whether we are in the grip of historical decay.\r\nWe know that history is ours to make. And if there is great danger, there\r\nis now also the excitement of great expectations.\r\n\r\nAMERICA AND THE COMMUNIST NATIONS\r\n\r\nYet we still live in a troubled and\r\nperilous world. There is no longer a single threat. There are many. They\r\ndiffer in intensity and in danger. They require different attitudes and\r\ndifferent answers.\r\n\r\nWith the Soviet Union we seek peaceful understandings that can lessen the\r\ndanger to freedom.\r\n\r\nLast fall I asked the American people to choose that course. I will carry\r\nforward their command.\r\n\r\nIf we are to live together in peace, we must come to know each other\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nI am sure that the American people would welcome a chance to listen to the\r\nSoviet leaders on our television--as I would like the Soviet people to hear\r\nour leaders on theirs.\r\n\r\nI hope the new Soviet leaders can visit America so they can learn about our\r\ncountry at firsthand.\r\n\r\nIn Eastern Europe restless nations are slowly beginning to assert their\r\nidentity. Your Government, assisted by the leaders in American labor and\r\nbusiness, is now exploring ways to increase peaceful trade with these\r\ncountries and with the Soviet Union. I will report our conclusions to the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIn Asia, communism wears a more aggressive face. We see that in Viet-Nam.\r\nWhy are we there?\r\n\r\nWe are there, first, because a friendly nation has asked us for help\r\nagainst the Communist aggression. Ten years ago our President pledged our\r\nhelp. Three Presidents have supported that pledge. We will not break it\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nSecond, our own security is tied to the peace of Asia. Twice in one\r\ngeneration we have had to fight against aggression in the Far East. To\r\nignore aggression now would only increase the danger of a much larger war.\r\n\r\nOur goal is peace in southeast Asia. That will come only when aggressors\r\nleave their neighbors in peace.\r\n\r\nWhat is at stake is the cause of freedom and in that cause America will\r\nnever be found wanting.\r\n\r\nTHE NON-COMMUNIST WORLD\r\n\r\nBut communism is not the only source of trouble and\r\nunrest. There are older and deeper sources--in the misery of nations and in\r\nman's irrepressible ambition for liberty and a better life.\r\n\r\nWith the free Republics of Latin America I have always felt--and my country\r\nhas always felt--very special ties of interest and affection. It will be\r\nthe purpose of my administration to strengthen these ties. Together we\r\nshare and shape the destiny of the new world. In the coming year I hope to\r\npay a visit to Latin America. And I will steadily enlarge our commitment to\r\nthe Alliance for Progress as the instrument of our war against poverty and\r\ninjustice in this hemisphere.\r\n\r\nIn the Atlantic community we continue to pursue our goal of 20 years--a\r\nEurope that is growing in strength, unity, and cooperation with America. A\r\ngreat unfinished task is the reunification of Germany through\r\nself-determination.\r\n\r\nThis European policy is not based on any abstract design. It is based on\r\nthe realities of common interests and common values, common dangers and\r\ncommon expectations. These realities will continue to have their\r\nway--especially, I think, in our expanding trade and especially in our\r\ncommon defense.\r\n\r\nFree Americans have shaped the policies of the United States. And because\r\nwe know these realities, those policies have been, and will be, in the\r\ninterest of Europe.\r\n\r\nFree Europeans must shape the course of Europe. And, for the same reasons,\r\nthat course has been, and will be, in our interest and in the interest of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nI found this truth confirmed in my talks with European leaders in the last\r\nyear. I hope to repay these visits to some of our friends in Europe this\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIn Africa and Asia we are witnessing the turbulent unfolding of new nations\r\nand continents.\r\n\r\nWe welcome them to the society of nations.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to help those seeking to strengthen their own\r\nindependence, and to work most closely with those governments dedicated to\r\nthe welfare of all of their people.\r\n\r\nWe seek not fidelity to an iron faith, but a diversity of belief as varied\r\nas man himself. We seek not to extend the power of America but the progress\r\nof humanity. We seek not to dominate others but to strengthen the freedom\r\nof all people.\r\n\r\nI will seek new ways to use our knowledge to help deal with the explosion\r\nin world population and the growing scarcity in world resources.\r\n\r\nFinally, we renew our commitment to the continued growth and the\r\neffectiveness of the United Nations. The frustrations of the United Nations\r\nare a product of the world that we live in, and not of the institution\r\nwhich gives them voice. It is far better to throw these differences open to\r\nthe assembly of nations than to permit them to fester in silent danger.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the goals of the American Nation in the world in which we\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nFor ourselves we seek neither praise nor blame, neither gratitude nor\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nWe seek peace.\r\n\r\nWe seek freedom.\r\n\r\nWe seek to enrich the life of man.\r\n\r\nFor that is the world in which we will flourish and that is the world that\r\nwe mean for all men to ultimately have.\r\n\r\nTOWARD THE GREAT SOCIETY\r\n\r\nWorld affairs will continue to call upon our energy\r\nand our courage.\r\n\r\nBut today we can turn increased attention to the character of American\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWe are in the midst of the greatest upward surge of economic well-being in\r\nthe history of any nation.\r\n\r\nOur flourishing progress has been marked by price stability that is\r\nunequalled in the world. Our balance of payments deficit has declined and\r\nthe soundness of our dollar is unquestioned. I pledge to keep it that way\r\nand I urge business and labor to cooperate to that end.\r\n\r\nWe worked for two centuries to climb this peak of prosperity. But we are\r\nonly at the beginning of the road to the Great Society. Ahead now is a\r\nsummit where freedom from the wants of the body can help fulfill the needs\r\nof the spirit.\r\n\r\nWe built this Nation to serve its people.\r\n\r\nWe want to grow and build and create, but we want progress to be the\r\nservant and not the master of man.\r\n\r\nWe do not intend to live in the midst of abundance, isolated from neighbors\r\nand nature, confined by blighted cities and bleak suburbs, stunted by a\r\npoverty of learning and an emptiness of leisure.\r\n\r\nThe Great Society asks not how much, but how good; not only how to create\r\nwealth but how to use it; not only how fast we are going, but where we are\r\nheaded.\r\n\r\nIt proposes as the first test for a nation: the quality of its people.\r\n\r\nThis kind of society will not flower spontaneously from swelling riches and\r\nsurging power.\r\n\r\nIt will not be the gift of government or the creation of presidents. It\r\nwill require of every American, for many generations, both faith in the\r\ndestination and the fortitude to make the journey.\r\n\r\nAnd like freedom itself, it will always be challenge and not fulfillment.\r\nAnd tonight we accept that challenge.\r\n\r\nA NATIONAL AGENDA\r\n\r\nI propose that we begin a program in education to ensure\r\nevery American child the fullest development of his mind and skills.\r\n\r\nI propose that we begin a massive attack on crippling and killing\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nI propose that we launch a national effort to make the American city a\r\nbetter and a more stimulating place to live.\r\n\r\nI propose that we increase the beauty of America and end the poisoning of\r\nour rivers and the air that we breathe.\r\n\r\nI propose that we carry out a new program to develop regions of our country\r\nthat are now suffering from distress and depression.\r\n\r\nI propose that we make new efforts to control and prevent crime and\r\ndelinquency.\r\n\r\nI propose that we eliminate every remaining obstacle to the right and the\r\nopportunity to vote.\r\n\r\nI propose that we honor and support the achievements of thought and the\r\ncreations of art.\r\n\r\nI propose that we make an all-out campaign against waste and inefficiency.\r\n\r\nTHE TASK\r\n\r\nOur basic task is threefold:\r\n\r\nFirst, to keep our economy growing;\r\n\r\n--to open for all Americans the opportunity that is now enjoyed by most\r\nAmericans;\r\n\r\n--and to improve the quality of life for all.\r\n\r\nIn the next 6 weeks I will submit special messages with detailed proposals\r\nfor national action in each of these areas.\r\n\r\nTonight I would like just briefly to explain some of my major\r\nrecommendations in the three main areas of national need.\r\n\r\n1. A GROWING ECONOMY\r\n\r\nBASIC POLICIES\r\n\r\nFirst, we must keep our Nation prosperous. We seek full\r\nemployment opportunity for every American citizen. I will present a budget\r\ndesigned to move the economy forward. More money will be left in the hands\r\nof the consumer by a substantial cut in excise taxes. We will continue\r\nalong the path toward a balanced budget in a balanced economy.\r\n\r\nI confidently predict--what every economic sign tells us tonight--the\r\ncontinued flourishing of the American economy.\r\n\r\nBut we must remember that fear of a recession can contribute to the fact of\r\na recession. The knowledge that our Government will, and can, move swiftly\r\nwill strengthen the confidence of investors and business.\r\n\r\nCongress can reinforce this confidence by insuring that its procedures\r\npermit rapid action on temporary income tax cuts. And special funds for\r\njob-creating public programs should be made available for immediate use if\r\nrecession threatens.\r\n\r\nOur continued prosperity demands continued price stability. Business,\r\nlabor, and the consumer all have a high stake in keeping wages and prices\r\nwithin the framework of the guideposts that have already served the Nation\r\nso well.\r\n\r\nFinding new markets abroad for our goods depends on the initiative of\r\nAmerican business. But we stand ready--with credit and other help--to\r\nassist the flow of trade which will benefit the entire Nation.\r\n\r\nON THE FARMS\r\n\r\nOur economy owes much to the efficiency of our farmers. We must\r\ncontinue to assure them the opportunity to earn a fair reward. I have\r\ninstructed the Secretary of Agriculture to lead a major effort to find new\r\napproaches to reduce the heavy cost of our farm programs and to direct more\r\nof our effort to the small farmer who needs the help the most.\r\n\r\nINCREASED PROSPERITY\r\n\r\nWe can help insure continued prosperity through:\r\n\r\n--a regional recovery program to assist the development of stricken areas\r\nleft behind by our national progress;\r\n\r\n--further efforts to provide our workers with the skills demanded by modern\r\ntechnology, for the laboring-man is an indispensable force in the American\r\nsystem;\r\n\r\n--the extension of the minimum wage to more than 2 million unprotected\r\nworkers;\r\n\r\n--the improvement and the modernization of the unemployment compensation\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAnd as pledged in our 1960 and 1964 Democratic platforms, I will propose to\r\nCongress changes in the Taft-Hartley Act including section 14(b). I will do\r\nso hoping to reduce the conflicts that for several years have divided\r\nAmericans in various States of our Union.\r\n\r\nIn a country that spans a continent modern transportation is vital to\r\ncontinued growth.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTATION FOR GROWTH\r\n\r\nI will recommend heavier reliance on competition\r\nin transportation and a new policy for our merchant marine.\r\n\r\nI will ask for funds to study high-speed rail transportation between urban\r\ncenters. We will begin with test projects between Washington and Boston. On\r\nhigh-speed trains, passengers could travel this distance in less than 4\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nII. OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL\r\n\r\nSecond, we must open opportunity to all our people.\r\n\r\nMost Americans enjoy a good life. But far too many are still trapped in\r\npoverty and idleness and fear.\r\n\r\nLet a just nation throw open to them the city of promise:\r\n\r\n--to the elderly, by providing hospital care under social security and by\r\nraising benefit payments to those struggling to maintain the dignity of\r\ntheir later years;\r\n\r\n--to the poor and the unfortunate, through doubling the war against poverty\r\nthis year;\r\n\r\n--to Negro Americans, through enforcement of the civil rights law and\r\nelimination of barriers to the right to vote;\r\n\r\n--to those in other lands that are seeking the promise of America, through\r\nan immigration law based on the work a man can do and not where he was born\r\nor how he spells his name.\r\n\r\nIII. TO ENRICH THE LIFE OF ALL\r\n\r\nOur third goal is to improve the quality of\r\nAmerican life.\r\n\r\nTHROUGH EDUCATION\r\n\r\nWe begin with learning.\r\n\r\nEvery child must have the best education that this Nation can provide.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson said that no nation can be both ignorant and free. Today\r\nno nation can be both ignorant and great.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our existing programs, I will recommend a new program for\r\nschools and students with a first year authorization of $1,500 million.\r\n\r\nIt will help at every stage along the road to learning.\r\n\r\nFor the preschool years we will help needy children become aware of the\r\nexcitement of learning.\r\n\r\nFor the primary and secondary school years we will aid public schools\r\nserving low-income families and assist students in both public and private\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nFor the college years we will provide scholarships to high school students\r\nof the greatest promise and the greatest need and we will guarantee\r\nlow-interest loans to students continuing their college studies.\r\n\r\nNew laboratories and centers will help our schools--help them lift their\r\nstandards of excellence and explore new methods of teaching. These centers\r\nwill provide special training for those who need and those who deserve\r\nspecial treatment.\r\n\r\nTHROUGH BETTER HEALTH\r\n\r\nGreatness requires not only an educated people but a\r\nhealthy people.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to match the achievements of our medicine to the afflictions of\r\nour people.\r\n\r\nWe already carry on a large program in this country for research and\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nIn addition, regional medical centers can provide the most advanced\r\ndiagnosis and treatment for heart disease and cancer and stroke and other\r\nmajor diseases.\r\n\r\nNew support for medical and dental education will provide the trained\r\npeople to apply our knowledge.\r\n\r\nCommunity centers can help the mentally ill and improve health care for\r\nschool-age children from poor families, including services for the mentally\r\nretarded.\r\n\r\nTHROUGH IMPROVING THE WORLD WE LIVE IN\r\n\r\nThe City\r\n\r\nAn educated and healthy people require surroundings in harmony with\r\ntheir hopes. In our urban areas the central problem today is to protect and\r\nrestore man's satisfaction in belonging to a community where he can find\r\nsecurity and significance.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to break old patterns--to begin to think and work and\r\nplan for the development of the entire metropolitan areas. We will take\r\nthis step with new programs of help for the basic community facilities and\r\nfor neighborhood centers of health and recreation.\r\n\r\nNew and existing programs will be open to those cities which work together\r\nto develop unified long-range policies for metropolitan areas.\r\n\r\nWe must also make some very important changes in our housing programs if we\r\nare to pursue these same basic goals.\r\n\r\nSo a Department of Housing and Urban Development will be needed to\r\nspearhead this effort in our cities.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen has the right to feel secure in his home and on the streets\r\nof his community.\r\n\r\nTo help control crime, we will recommend programs:\r\n\r\n--to train local law enforcement officers;\r\n\r\n--to put the best techniques of modern science at their disposal;\r\n\r\n--to discover the causes of crime and better ways to prevent it.\r\n\r\nI will soon assemble a panel of outstanding experts of this Nation to\r\nsearch out answers to the national problem of crime and delinquency, and I\r\nwelcome the recommendations and the constructive efforts of the Congress.\r\nThe Beauty of America\r\n\r\nFor over three centuries the beauty of America has sustained our spirit and\r\nhas enlarged our vision. We must act now to protect this heritage. In a\r\nfruitful new partnership with the States and the cities the next decade\r\nshould be a conservation milestone. We must make a massive effort to save\r\nthe countryside and to establish--as a green legacy for tomorrow--more\r\nlarge and small parks, more seashores and open spaces than have been\r\ncreated during any other period in our national history.\r\n\r\nA new and substantial effort must be made to landscape highways to provide\r\nplaces of relaxation and recreation wherever our roads run,\r\n\r\nWithin our cities imaginative programs are needed to landscape streets and\r\nto transform open areas into places of beauty and recreation.\r\n\r\nWe will seek legal power to prevent pollution of our air and water before\r\nit happens. We will step up our effort to control harmful wastes, giving\r\nfirst priority to the cleanup of our most contaminated rivers. We will\r\nincrease research to learn much more about the control of pollution.\r\n\r\nWe hope to make the Potomac a model of beauty here in the Capital, and\r\npreserve unspoiled stretches of some of our waterways with a Wild Rivers\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nMore ideas for a beautiful America will emerge from a White House\r\nConference on Natural Beauty which I will soon call.\r\n\r\nArt and Science\r\n\r\nWe must also recognize and encourage those who can be\r\npathfinders for the Nation's imagination and understanding.\r\n\r\nTo help promote and honor creative achievements, I will propose a National\r\nFoundation on the Arts.\r\n\r\nTo develop knowledge which will enrich our lives and ensure our progress, I\r\nwill recommend programs to encourage basic science, particularly in the\r\nuniversities--and to bring closer the day when the oceans will supply our\r\ngrowing need for fresh water.\r\n\r\nFor government to serve these goals it must be modern in structure,\r\nefficient in action, and ready for any emergency.\r\n\r\nI am busy, currently, reviewing the structure of the entire executive\r\nbranch of this Government. I hope to reshape it and to reorganize it to\r\nmeet more effectively the tasks of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nWherever waste is found, I will eliminate it.\r\n\r\nLast year we saved almost $3,500 million by eliminating waste in the\r\nNational Government.\r\n\r\nAnd I intend to do better this year.\r\n\r\nAnd very soon I will report to you on our progress and on new economies\r\nthat your Government plans to make.\r\n\r\nEven the best of government is subject to the worst of hazards.\r\n\r\nI will propose laws to insure the necessary continuity of leadership should\r\nthe President become disabled or die.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I will propose reforms in the electoral college--leaving\r\nundisturbed the vote by States--but making sure that no elector can\r\nsubstitute his will for that of the people.\r\n\r\nLast year, in a sad moment, I came here and I spoke to you after 33 years\r\nof public service, practically all of them here on this Hill.\r\n\r\nThis year I speak after 1 year as President of the United States.\r\n\r\nMany of you in this Chamber are among my oldest friends. We have shared\r\nmany happy moments and many hours of work, and we have watched many\r\nPresidents together. Yet, only in the White House can you finally know the\r\nfull weight of this Office.\r\n\r\nThe greatest burden is not running the huge operations of government--or\r\nmeeting daily troubles, large and small--or even working with the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nA President's hardest task is not to do what is right, but to know what is\r\nright.\r\n\r\nYet the Presidency brings no special gift of prophecy or foresight. You\r\ntake an oath, you step into an office, and you must then help guide a great\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nThe answer was waiting for me in the land where I was born.\r\n\r\nIt was once barren land. The angular hills were covered with scrub cedar\r\nand a few large live oaks. Little would grow in that harsh caliche soil of\r\nmy country. And each spring the Pedernales River would flood our valley.\r\n\r\nBut men came and they worked and they endured and they built.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight that country is abundant; abundant with fruit and cattle and\r\ngoats and sheep, and there are pleasant homes and lakes and the floods are\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nWhy did men come to that once forbidding land?\r\n\r\nWell, they were restless, of course, and they had to be moving on. But\r\nthere was more than that. There was a dream--a dream of a place where a\r\nfree man could build for himself, and raise his children to a better\r\nlife--a dream of a continent to be conquered, a world to be won, a nation\r\nto be made.\r\n\r\nRemembering this, I knew the answer.\r\n\r\nA President does not shape a new and personal vision of America.\r\n\r\nHe collects it from the scattered hopes of the American past.\r\n\r\nIt existed when the first settlers saw the coast of a new world, and when\r\nthe first pioneers moved westward.\r\n\r\nIt has guided us every step of the way.\r\n\r\nIt sustains every President. But it is also your inheritance and it belongs\r\nequally to all the people that we all serve.\r\n\r\nIt must be interpreted anew by each generation for its own needs; as I have\r\ntried, in part, to do tonight.\r\n\r\nIt shall lead us as we enter the third century of the search for a more\r\nperfect union?\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the state of the Union: Free and restless, growing and full\r\nof hope.\r\n\r\nSo it was in the beginning.\r\n\r\nSo it shall always be, while God is willing, and we are strong enough to\r\nkeep the faith.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nLyndon B. Johnson\r\nJanuary 12, 1966\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the House and the Senate, my fellow\r\nAmericans:\r\n\r\nI come before you tonight to report on the State of the Union for the third\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI come here to thank you and to add my tribute, once more, to the Nation's\r\ngratitude for this, the 89th Congress. This Congress has already reserved\r\nfor itself an honored chapter in the history of America.\r\n\r\nOur Nation tonight is engaged in a brutal and bitter conflict in Vietnam.\r\nLater on I want to discuss that struggle in some detail with you. It just\r\nmust be the center of our concerns.\r\n\r\nBut we will not permit those who fire upon us in Vietnam to win a victory\r\nover the desires and the intentions of all the American people. This Nation\r\nis mighty enough, its society is healthy enough, its people are strong\r\nenough, to pursue our goals in the rest of the world while still building a\r\nGreat Society here at home.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what I have come here to ask of you tonight.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you provide the resources to carry forward, with full\r\nvigor, the great health and education programs that you enacted into law\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nI recommend that we prosecute with vigor and determination our war on\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you give a new and daring direction to our foreign aid\r\nprogram, designed to make a maximum attack on hunger and disease and\r\nignorance in those countries that are determined to help themselves, and to\r\nhelp those nations that are trying to control population growth.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you make it possible to expand trade between the United\r\nStates and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nI recommend to you a program to rebuild completely, on a scale never before\r\nattempted, entire central and slum areas of several of our cities in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our\r\nrivers, and, as the cornerstone of this effort, clean completely entire\r\nlarge river basins.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you meet the growing menace of crime in the streets by\r\nbuilding up law enforcement and by revitalizing the entire Federal system\r\nfrom prevention to probation.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you take additional steps to insure equal justice to all\r\nof our people by effectively enforcing nondiscrimination in Federal and\r\nState jury selection, by making it a serious Federal crime to obstruct\r\npublic and private efforts to secure civil rights, and by outlawing\r\ndiscrimination in the sale and rental of housing.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you help me modernize and streamline the Federal\r\nGovernment by creating a new Cabinet level Department of Transportation and\r\nreorganizing several existing agencies. In turn, I will restructure our\r\ncivil service in the top grades so that men and women can easily be\r\nassigned to jobs where they are most needed, and ability will be both\r\nrequired as well as rewarded.\r\n\r\nI will ask you to make it possible for Members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives to work more effectively in the service of the Nation\r\nthrough a constitutional amendment extending the term of a Congressman to 4\r\nyears, concurrent with that of the President. II.\r\n\r\nBecause of Vietnam we cannot do all that we should, or all that we would\r\nlike to do. We will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency. We will make\r\nsure that every dollar is spent with the thrift and with the commonsense\r\nwhich recognizes how hard the taxpayer worked in order to earn it.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to meet the needs of our people by continuing to develop\r\nthe Great Society.\r\n\r\nLast year alone the wealth that we produced increased $47 billion, and it\r\nwill soar again this year to a total over $720 billion.\r\n\r\nBecause our economic policies have produced rising revenues, if you approve\r\nevery program that I recommend tonight, our total budget deficit will be\r\none of the lowest in many years. It will be only $1.8 billion next year.\r\nTotal spending in the administrative budget will be $112.8 billion.\r\nRevenues next year will be $111 billion.\r\n\r\nOn a cash basis--which is the way that you and I keep our family\r\nbudget--the Federal budget next year will actually show a surplus. That is\r\nto say, if we include all the money that your Government will take in and\r\nall the money that your Government will spend, your Government next year\r\nwill collect one-half billion dollars more than it will spend in the year\r\n1967.\r\n\r\nI have not come here tonight to ask for pleasant luxuries or for idle\r\npleasures. I have come here to recommend that you, the representatives of\r\nthe richest Nation on earth, you, the elected servants of a people who live\r\nin abundance unmatched on this globe, you bring the most urgent decencies\r\nof life to all of your fellow Americans.\r\n\r\nThere are men who cry out: We must sacrifice. Well, let us rather ask them:\r\nWho will they sacrifice? Are they going to sacrifice the children who seek\r\nthe learning, or the sick who need medical care, or the families who dwell\r\nin squalor now brightened by the hope of home? Will they sacrifice\r\nopportunity for the distressed, the beauty of our land, the hope of our\r\npoor?\r\n\r\nTime may require further sacrifices. And if it does, then we will make\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut we will not heed those who wring it from the hopes of the unfortunate\r\nhere in a land of plenty.\r\n\r\nI believe that we can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam.\r\nBut if there are some who do not believe this, then, in the name of\r\njustice, let them call for the contribution of those who live in the\r\nfullness of our blessing, rather than try to strip it from the hands of\r\nthose that are most in need.\r\n\r\nAnd let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land\r\nsit stifled and alone in their hope tonight. Hundreds of their servants and\r\ntheir protectors sit before me tonight here in this great Chamber. III.\r\n\r\nThe Great Society leads us along three roads--growth and justice and\r\nliberation.\r\n\r\nI can report to you tonight what you have seen for yourselves already--in\r\nevery city and countryside. This Nation is flourishing.\r\n\r\nWorkers are making more money than ever--with after-tax income in the past\r\n5 years up 33 percent; in the last year alone, up 8 percent.\r\n\r\nMore people are working than ever before in our history--an increase last\r\nyear of 2 1/2 million jobs.\r\n\r\nCorporations have greater after-tax earnings than ever in history. For the\r\npast 5 years those earnings have been up over 65 percent, and last year\r\nalone they had a rise of 20 percent.\r\n\r\nAverage farm income is higher than ever. Over the past 5 years it is up 40\r\npercent, and over the past year it is up 22 percent alone.\r\n\r\nI was informed this afternoon by the distinguished Secretary of the\r\nTreasury that his preliminary estimates indicate that our balance of\r\npayments deficit has been reduced from $2.8 billion in 1964 to $1.3\r\nbillion, or less, in 1965. This achievement has been made possible by the\r\npatriotic voluntary cooperation of businessmen and bankers working with\r\nyour Government.\r\n\r\nWe must now work together with increased urgency to wipe out this balance\r\nof payments deficit altogether in the next year.\r\n\r\nAnd as our economy surges toward new heights we must increase our vigilance\r\nagainst the inflation which raises the cost of living and which lowers the\r\nsavings of every family in this land. It is essential, to prevent\r\ninflation, that we ask both labor and business to exercise price and wage\r\nrestraint, and I do so again tonight.\r\n\r\nI believe it desirable, because of increased military expenditures, that\r\nyou temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax\r\nreductions made effective only 12 days ago. Without raising taxes--or even\r\nincreasing the total tax bill paid--we should move to improve our\r\nwithholding system so that Americans can more realistically pay as they go,\r\nspeed up the collection of corporate taxes, and make other necessary\r\nsimplifications of the tax structure at an early date.\r\n\r\nI hope these measures will be adequate. But if the necessities of Vietnam\r\nrequire it, I will not hesitate to return to the Congress for additional\r\nappropriations, or additional revenues if they are needed.\r\n\r\nI propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirements for\r\nnondiscriminatory jury selection in Federal and State courts--and to give\r\nthe Attorney General the power necessary to enforce those requirements.\r\n\r\nI propose legislation to strengthen authority of Federal courts to try\r\nthose who murder, attack, or intimidate either civil rights workers or\r\nothers exercising their constitutional rights--and to increase penalties to\r\na level equal to the nature of the crime.\r\n\r\nLegislation, resting on the fullest constitutional authority of the Federal\r\nGovernment, to prohibit racial discrimination in the sale or rental of\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\nFor that other nation within a Nation--the poor--whose distress has now\r\ncaptured the conscience of America, I will ask the Congress not only to\r\ncontinue, but to speed up the war on poverty. And in so doing, we will\r\nprovide the added energy of achievement with the increased efficiency of\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nTo improve the life of our rural Americans and our farm population, we will\r\nplan for the future through the establishment of several new Community\r\nDevelopment Districts, improved education through the use of Teacher Corps\r\nteams, better health measures, physical examinations, and adequate and\r\navailable medical resources.\r\n\r\nFor those who labor, I propose to improve unemployment insurance, to expand\r\nminimum wage benefits, and by the repeal of section 14(b) of the\r\nTaft-Hartley Act to make the labor laws in all our States equal to the laws\r\nof the 31 States which do not have tonight right-to-work measures.\r\n\r\nAnd I also intend to ask the Congress to consider measures which, without\r\nimproperly invading State and local authority, will enable us effectively\r\nto deal with strikes which threaten irreparable damage to the national\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nYet, slowly, painfully, on the edge of victory, has come the knowledge that\r\nshared prosperity is not enough. In the midst of abundance modern man walks\r\noppressed by forces which menace and confine the quality of his life, and\r\nwhich individual abundance alone will not overcome.\r\n\r\nWe can subdue and we can master these forces--bring increased meaning to\r\nour lives--if all of us, Government and citizens, are bold enough to change\r\nold ways, daring enough to assault new dangers, and if the dream is dear\r\nenough to call forth the limitless capacities of this great people.\r\n\r\nThis year we must continue to improve the quality of American life.\r\n\r\nLet us fulfill and improve the great health and education programs of last\r\nyear, extending special opportunities to those who risk their lives in our\r\nArmed Forces.\r\n\r\nI urge the House of Representatives to complete action on three programs\r\nalready passed by the Senate--the Teacher Corps, rent assistance, and home\r\nrule for the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nIn some of our urban areas we must help rebuild entire sections and\r\nneighborhoods containing, in some cases, as many as 100,000 people. Working\r\ntogether, private enterprise and government must press forward with the\r\ntask of providing homes and shops, parks and hospitals, and all the other\r\nnecessary parts of a flourishing community where our people can come to\r\nlive the good life.\r\n\r\nI will offer other proposals to stimulate and to reward planning for the\r\ngrowth of entire metropolitan areas.\r\n\r\nOf all the reckless devastations of our national heritage, none is really\r\nmore shameful than the continued poisoning of our rivers and our air.\r\n\r\nWe must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river\r\nbasins, making additional funds available to help draw the plans and\r\nconstruct the plants that are necessary to make the waters of our entire\r\nriver systems clean, and make them a source of pleasure and beauty for all\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\nTo attack and to overcome growing crime and lawlessness, I think we must\r\nhave a stepped-up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nOur people have a right to feel secure in their homes and on their\r\nstreets--and that right just must be secured.\r\n\r\nNor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our\r\nhighways.\r\n\r\nI will propose a Highway Safety Act of 1966 to seek an end to this mounting\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nWe must also act to prevent the deception of the American\r\nconsumer--requiring all packages to state clearly and truthfully their\r\ncontents--all interest and credit charges to be fully revealed--and keeping\r\nharmful drugs and cosmetics away from our stores.\r\n\r\nIt is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring\r\ninstitutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich\r\nfertility of American political invention. We must change to master\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nI propose to take steps to modernize and streamline the executive branch,\r\nto modernize the relations between city and State and Nation.\r\n\r\nA new Department of Transportation is needed to bring together our\r\ntransportation activities. The present structure--35 Government agencies,\r\nspending $5 billion yearly--makes it almost impossible to serve either the\r\ngrowing demands of this great Nation or the needs of the industry, or the\r\nright of the taxpayer to full efficiency and real frugality.\r\n\r\nI will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight-test a new\r\nsupersonic transport airplane that will fly three times the speed of\r\nsound--in excess of 2,000 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nI propose to examine our Federal system--the relation between city, State,\r\nNation, and the citizens themselves. We need a commission of the most\r\ndistinguished scholars and men of public affairs to do this job. I will ask\r\nthem to move on to develop a creative federalism to best use the wonderful\r\ndiversity of our institutions and our people to solve the problems and to\r\nfulfill the dreams of the American people.\r\n\r\nAs the process of election becomes more complex and more costly, we must\r\nmake it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life\r\nwithout being obligated to a few large contributors.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic\r\nrestriction on contributions--to prohibit the endless proliferation of\r\ncommittees, bringing local and State committees under the act--to attach\r\nstrong teeth and severe penalties to the requirement of full disclosure of\r\ncontributions--and to broaden the participation of the people, through added\r\ntax incentives, to stimulate small contributions to the party and to the\r\ncandidate of their choice.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen the work of Congress I strongly urge an amendment to provide\r\na 4-year term for Members of the House of Representatives--which should not\r\nbegin before 1972.\r\n\r\nThe present 2-year term requires most Members of Congress to divert\r\nenormous energies to an almost constant process of campaigning--depriving\r\nthis Nation of the fullest measure of both their skill and their wisdom.\r\nToday, too, the work of government is far more complex than in our early\r\nyears, requiring more time to learn and more time to master the technical\r\ntasks of legislating. And a longer term will serve to attract more men of\r\nthe highest quality to political life. The Nation, the principle of\r\ndemocracy, and, I think, each congressional district, will all be better\r\nserved by a 4-year term for Members of the House. And I urge your swift\r\naction. IV.\r\n\r\nTonight the cup of peril is full in Vietnam. That conflict is not an\r\nisolated episode, but another great event in the policy that we have\r\nfollowed with strong consistency since World War II.\r\n\r\nThe touchstone of that policy is the interest of the United States--the\r\nwelfare and the freedom of the people of the United States. But nations\r\nsink when they see that interest only through a narrow glass.\r\n\r\nIn a world that has grown small and dangerous, pursuit of narrow aims could\r\nbring decay and even disaster.\r\n\r\nAn America that is mighty beyond description--yet living in a hostile or\r\ndespairing world--would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization to\r\nliberate the spirit of man.\r\n\r\nIn this pursuit we helped rebuild Western Europe. We gave our aid to Greece\r\nand Turkey, and we defended the freedom of Berlin.\r\n\r\nIn this pursuit we have helped new nations toward independence. We have\r\nextended the helping hand of the Peace Corps and carried forward the\r\nlargest program of economic assistance in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of\r\nsocial justice.\r\n\r\nIn this pursuit we have defended against Communist aggression--in Korea\r\nunder President Truman--in the Formosa Straits under President\r\nEisenhower--in Cuba under President Kennedy--and again in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nTonight Vietnam must hold the center of our attention, but across the world\r\nproblems and opportunities crowd in on the American Nation. I will discuss\r\nthem fully in the months to come, and I will follow the five continuing\r\nlines of policy that America has followed under its last four Presidents.\r\n\r\nWhile special Vietnam expenditures for the next fiscal year are estimated\r\nto increase by $5.8 billion, I can tell you that all the other expenditures\r\nput together in the entire Federal budget will rise this coming year by\r\nonly $.6 billion. This is true because of the stringent cost-conscious\r\neconomy program inaugurated in the Defense Department, and followed by the\r\nother departments of Government.\r\n\r\nWe will vigorously pursue existing proposals--and seek new ones--to control\r\narms and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nBy strengthening the common defense, by stimulating world commerce, by\r\nmeeting new hopes, these associations serve the cause of a flourishing\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWe will take new steps this year to help strengthen the Alliance for\r\nProgress, the unity of Europe, the community of the Atlantic, the regional\r\norganizations of developing continents, and that supreme association--the\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n\r\nWe will work to strengthen economic cooperation, to reduce barriers to\r\ntrade, and to improve international finance.\r\n\r\nFrom the Marshall plan to this very moment tonight, that policy has rested\r\non the claims of compassion, and the certain knowledge that only a people\r\nadvancing in expectation will build secure and peaceful lands.\r\n\r\nThis year I propose major new directions in our program of foreign\r\nassistance to help those countries who will help themselves.\r\n\r\nWe will conduct a worldwide attack on the problems of hunger and disease\r\nand ignorance.\r\n\r\nWe will place the matchless skill and the resources of our own great\r\nAmerica, in farming and in fertilizers, at the service of those countries\r\ncommitted to develop a modern agriculture.\r\n\r\nWe will aid those who educate the young in other lands, and we will give\r\nchildren in other continents the same head start that we are trying to give\r\nour own children. To advance these ends I will propose the International\r\nEducation Act of 1966.\r\n\r\nI will also propose the International Health Act of 1966 to strike at\r\ndisease by a new effort to bring modern skills and knowledge to the\r\nuncared-for, those suffering in the world, and by trying to wipe out\r\nsmallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during\r\nthis next decade; to help countries trying to control population growth, by\r\nincreasing our research--and we will earmark funds to help their efforts.\r\n\r\nIn the next year, from our foreign aid sources, we propose to dedicate $1\r\nbillion to these efforts, and we call on all who have the means to join us\r\nin this work in the world.\r\n\r\nFor a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walks\r\nthe way that it has chosen to walk for itself.\r\n\r\nWe follow this principle by encouraging the end of colonial rule.\r\n\r\nWe follow this principle, abroad as well as at home, by continued hostility\r\nto the rule of the many by the few--or the oppression of one race by\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWe follow this principle by building bridges to Eastern Europe. And I will\r\nask the Congress for authority to remove the special tariff restrictions\r\nwhich are a barrier to increasing trade between the East and the West.\r\n\r\nThe insistent urge toward national independence is the strongest force of\r\ntoday's world in which we live.\r\n\r\nIn Africa and Asia and Latin America it is shattering the designs of those\r\nwho would subdue others to their ideas or their will.\r\n\r\nIt is eroding the unity of what was once a Stalinist empire.\r\n\r\nIn recent months a number of nations have east out those who would subject\r\nthem to the ambitions of mainland China.\r\n\r\nHistory is on the side of freedom and is on the side of societies shaped\r\nfrom the genius of each people. History does not favor a single system or\r\nbelief--unless force is used to make it so.\r\n\r\nThat is why it has been necessary for us to defend this basic principle of\r\nour policy, to defend it in Berlin, in Korea, in Cuba--and tonight in\r\nVietnam.\r\n\r\nFor tonight, as so many nights before, young Americans struggle and young\r\nAmericans die in a distant land.\r\n\r\nTonight, as so many nights before, the American Nation is asked to\r\nsacrifice the blood of its children and the fruits of its labor for the\r\nlove of its freedom.\r\n\r\nHow many times--in my lifetime and in yours--have the American people\r\ngathered, as they do now, to hear their President tell them of conflict and\r\ntell them of danger?\r\n\r\nEach time they have answered. They have answered with all the effort that\r\nthe security and the freedom of this Nation required.\r\n\r\nAnd they do again tonight in Vietnam. Not too many years ago Vietnam was a\r\npeaceful, if troubled, land. In the North was an independent Communist\r\ngovernment. In the South a people struggled to build a nation, with the\r\nfriendly help of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere were some in South Vietnam who wished to force Communist rule on\r\ntheir own people. But their progress was slight. Their hope of success was\r\ndim. Then, little more than 6 years ago, North Vietnam decided on conquest.\r\nAnd from that day to this, soldiers and supplies have moved from North to\r\nSouth in a swelling stream that is swallowing the remnants of revolution in\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nAs the assault mounted, our choice gradually became clear. We could leave,\r\nabandoning South Vietnam to its attackers and to certain conquest, or we\r\ncould stay and fight beside the people of South Vietnam. We stayed.\r\n\r\nAnd we will stay until aggression has stopped.\r\n\r\nWe will stay because a just nation cannot leave to the cruelties of its\r\nenemies a people who have staked their lives and independence on America's\r\nsolemn pledge--a pledge which has grown through the commitments of three\r\nAmerican Presidents.\r\n\r\nWe will stay because in Asia and around the world are countries whose\r\nindependence rests, in large measure, on confidence in America's word and\r\nin America's protection. To yield to force in Vietnam would weaken that\r\nconfidence, would undermine the independence of many lands, and would whet\r\nthe appetite of aggression. We would have to fight in one land, and then we\r\nwould have to fight in another--or abandon much of Asia to the domination\r\nof Communists.\r\n\r\nAnd we do not intend to abandon Asia to conquest.\r\n\r\nLast year the nature of the war in Vietnam changed again. Swiftly\r\nincreasing numbers of armed men from the North crossed the borders to join\r\nforces that were already in the South. Attack and terror increased, spurred\r\nand encouraged by the belief that the United States lacked the will to\r\ncontinue and that their victory was near.\r\n\r\nDespite our desire to limit conflict, it was necessary to act: to hold back\r\nthe mounting aggression, to give courage to the people of the South, and to\r\nmake our firmness clear to the North. Thus. we began limited air action\r\nagainst military targets in North Vietnam. We increased our fighting force\r\nto its present strength tonight of 190,000 men.\r\n\r\nThese moves have not ended the aggression but they have prevented its\r\nsuccess. The aims of the enemy have been put out of reach by the skill and\r\nthe bravery of Americans and their allies--and by the enduring courage of\r\nthe South Vietnamese who, I can tell you, have lost eight men last year for\r\nevery one of ours.\r\n\r\nThe enemy is no longer close to victory. Time is no longer on his side.\r\nThere is no cause to doubt the American commitment.\r\n\r\nOur decision to stand firm has been matched by our desire for peace.\r\n\r\nIn 1965 alone we had 300 private talks for peace in Vietnam, with friends\r\nand adversaries throughout the world.\r\n\r\nSince Christmas your Government has labored again, with imagination and\r\nendurance, to remove any barrier to peaceful settlement. For 20 days now we\r\nand our Vietnamese allies have dropped no bombs in North Vietnam.\r\n\r\nAble and experienced spokesmen have visited, in behalf of America, more\r\nthan 40 countries. We have talked to more than a hundred governments, all\r\n113 that we have relations with, and some that we don't. We have talked to\r\nthe United Nations and we have called upon all of its members to make any\r\ncontribution that they can toward helping obtain peace.\r\n\r\nIn public statements and in private communications, to adversaries and to\r\nfriends, in Rome and Warsaw, in Paris and Tokyo, in Africa and throughout\r\nthis hemisphere, America has made her position abundantly clear.\r\n\r\nWe seek neither territory nor bases, economic domination or military\r\nalliance in Vietnam. We fight for the principle of self-determination--that\r\nthe people of South Vietnam should be able to choose their own course,\r\nchoose it in free elections without violence, without terror, and without\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nThe people of all Vietnam should make a free decision on the great question\r\nof reunification.\r\n\r\nThis is all we want for South Vietnam. It is all the people of South\r\nVietnam want. And if there is a single nation on this earth that desires\r\nless than this for its own people, then let its voice be heard.\r\n\r\nWe have also made it clear--from Hanoi to New York--that there are no\r\narbitrary limits to our search for peace. We stand by the Geneva Agreements\r\nof 1954 and 1962. We will meet at any conference table, we will discuss any\r\nproposals--four points or fourteen or forty--and we will consider the views\r\nof any group. We will work for a cease-fire now or once discussions have\r\nbegun. We will respond if others reduce their use of force, and we will\r\nwithdraw our soldiers once South Vietnam is securely guaranteed the right\r\nto shape its own future.\r\n\r\nWe have said all this, and we have asked--and hoped--and we have waited for\r\na response.\r\n\r\nSo far we have received no response to prove either success or failure.\r\n\r\nWe have carried our quest for peace to many nations and peoples because we\r\nshare this planet with others whose future, in large measure, is tied to\r\nour own action, and whose counsel is necessary to our own hopes.\r\n\r\nWe have found understanding and support. And we know they wait with us\r\ntonight for some response that could lead to peace.\r\n\r\nI wish tonight that I could give you a blueprint for the course of this\r\nconflict over the coming months, but we just cannot know what the future\r\nmay require. We may have to face long, hard combat or a long, hard\r\nconference, or even both at once.\r\n\r\nUntil peace comes, or if it does not come, our course is clear. We will act\r\nas we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of South\r\nVietnam. We will strive to limit the conflict, for we wish neither\r\nincreased destruction nor do we want to invite increased danger.\r\n\r\nBut we will give our fighting men what they must have: every gun, and every\r\ndollar, and every decision--whatever the cost or whatever the challenge.\r\n\r\nAnd we will continue to help the people of South Vietnam care for those\r\nthat are ravaged by battle, create progress in the villages, and carry\r\nforward the healing hopes of peace as best they can amidst the uncertain\r\nterrors of war.\r\n\r\nAnd let me be absolutely clear: The days may become months, and the months\r\nmay become years, but we will stay as long as aggression commands us to\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThere may be some who do not want peace, whose ambitions stretch so far\r\nthat war in Vietnam is but a welcome and convenient episode in an immense\r\ndesign to subdue history to their will. But for others it must now be\r\nclear--the choice is not between peace and victory, it lies between peace\r\nand the ravages of a conflict from which they can only lose.\r\n\r\nThe people of Vietnam, North and South, seek the same things: the shared\r\nneeds of man, the needs for food and shelter and education--the chance to\r\nbuild and work and till the soil, free from the arbitrary horrors of\r\nbattle--the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own\r\ndestiny. For many painful years, in war and revolution and infrequent\r\npeace, they have struggled to fulfill those needs.\r\n\r\nIt is a crime against mankind that so much courage, and so much will, and\r\nso many dreams, must be flung on the fires of war and death.\r\n\r\nTo all of those caught up in this conflict we therefore say again tonight:\r\nLet us choose peace, and with it the wondrous works of peace, and beyond\r\nthat, the time when hope reaches toward consummation, and life is the\r\nservant of life.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we plan to discharge our duty to the people whom we serve.\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThis is the State of the Union.\r\n\r\nBut over it all--wealth, and promise, and expectation--lies our troubling\r\nawareness of American men at war tonight.\r\n\r\nHow many men who listen to me tonight have served their Nation in other\r\nwars? How very many are not here to listen?\r\n\r\nThe war in Vietnam is not like these other wars. Yet, finally, war is\r\nalways the same. It is young men dying in the fullness of their promise. It\r\nis trying to kill a man that you do not even know well enough to hate.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to know war is to know that there is still madness in this\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nMany of you share the burden of this knowledge tonight with me. But there\r\nis a difference. For finally I must be the one to order our guns to fire,\r\nagainst all the most inward pulls of my desire. For we have children to\r\nteach, and we have sick to be cured, and we have men to be freed. There are\r\npoor to be lifted up, and there are cities to be built, and there is a\r\nworld to be helped.\r\n\r\nYet we do what we must.\r\n\r\nI am hopeful, and I will try as best I can, with everything I have got, to\r\nend this battle and to return our sons to their desires.\r\n\r\nYet as long as others will challenge America's security and test the\r\nclearness of our beliefs with fire and steel, then we must stand or see the\r\npromise of two centuries tremble. I believe tonight that you do not want me\r\nto try that risk. And from that belief your President summons his strength\r\nfor the trials that lie ahead in the days to come.\r\n\r\nThe work must be our work now. Scarred by the weaknesses of man, with\r\nwhatever guidance God may offer us, we must nevertheless and alone with our\r\nmortality, strive to ennoble the life of man on earth.\r\n\r\nThank you, and goodnight.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nLyndon B. Johnson\r\nJanuary 10, 1967\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, distinguished Members of the Congress:\r\n\r\nI share with all of you the grief that you feel at the death today of one\r\nof the most beloved, respected, and effective Members of this body, the\r\ndistinguished Representative from Rhode Island, Mr. Fogarty.\r\n\r\nI have come here tonight to report to you that this is a time of testing\r\nfor our Nation.\r\n\r\nAt home, the question is whether we will continue working for better\r\nopportunities for all Americans, when most Americans are already living\r\nbetter than any people in history.\r\n\r\nAbroad, the question is whether we have the staying power to fight a very\r\ncostly war, when the objective is limited and the danger to us is seemingly\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nSo our test is not whether we shrink from our country's cause when the\r\ndangers to us are obvious and dose at hand, but, rather, whether we carry\r\non when they seem obscure and distant--and some think that it is safe to\r\nlay down our burdens.\r\n\r\nI have come tonight to ask this Congress and this Nation to resolve that\r\nissue: to meet our commitments at home and abroad--to continue to build a\r\nbetter America--and to reaffirm this Nation's allegiance to freedom.\r\n\r\nAs President Abraham Lincoln said, \"We must ask where we are, and whither\r\nwe are tending.\" I.\r\n\r\nThe last 3 years bear witness to our determination to make this a better\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWe have struck down legal barriers to equality.\r\n\r\nWe have improved the education of 7 million deprived children and this year\r\nalone we have enabled almost 1 million students to go to college.\r\n\r\nWe have brought medical care to older people who were unable to afford it.\r\nThree and one-half million Americans have already received treatment under\r\nMedicare since July.\r\n\r\nWe have built a strong economy that has put almost 3 million more Americans\r\non the payrolls in the last year alone.\r\n\r\nWe have included more than 9 million new workers under a higher minimum\r\nwage.\r\n\r\nWe have launched new training programs to provide job skills for almost 1\r\nmillion Americans.\r\n\r\nWe have helped more than a thousand local communities to attack poverty in\r\nthe neighborhoods of the poor. We have set out to rebuild our cities on a\r\nscale that has never been attempted before. We have begun to rescue our\r\nwaters from the menace of pollution and to restore the beauty of our land\r\nand our countryside, our cities and our towns.\r\n\r\nWe have given 1 million young Americans a chance to earn through the\r\nNeighborhood Youth Corps--or through Head Start, a chance to learn.\r\n\r\nSo together we have tried to meet the needs of our people. And, we have\r\nsucceeded in creating a better life for the many as well as the few. Now we\r\nmust answer whether our gains shall be the foundations of further progress,\r\nor whether they shall be only monuments to what might have been--abandoned\r\nnow by a people who lacked the will to see their great work through.\r\n\r\nI believe that our people do not want to quit--though the task is great,\r\nthe work hard, often frustrating, and success is a matter not of days or\r\nmonths, but of years--and sometimes it may be even decades. II.\r\n\r\nI have come here tonight to discuss with you five ways of carrying forward\r\nthe progress of these last 3 years. These five ways concern programs,\r\npartnerships, priorities, prosperity, and peace.\r\n\r\nFirst, programs. We must see to it, I think, that these new programs that\r\nwe have passed work effectively and are administered in the best possible\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThree years ago we set out to create these new instruments of social\r\nprogress. This required trial and error--and it has produced both. But as\r\nwe learn, through success and failure, we are changing our strategy and we\r\nare trying to improve our tactics. In the long run, these starts--some\r\nrewarding, others inadequate and disappointing--are crucial to SUCCESS.\r\n\r\nOne example is the struggle to make life better for the less fortunate\r\namong us.\r\n\r\nOn a similar occasion, at this rostrum in 1949, I heard a great American\r\nPresident, Harry S. Truman, declare this: \"The American people have decided\r\nthat poverty is just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable\r\ndisease.\"\r\n\r\nMany listened to President Truman that day here in this Chamber, but few\r\nunderstood what was required and did anything about it. The executive\r\nbranch and the Congress waited 15 long years before ever taking any action\r\non that challenge, as it did on many other challenges that great President\r\npresented. And when, 3 years ago, you here in the Congress joined with me\r\nin a declaration of war on poverty, then I warned, \"It will not be a short\r\nor easy struggle--no single weapon... will suffice--but we shall not rest\r\nuntil that war is won.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I have come here to renew that pledge tonight.\r\n\r\nI recommend that we intensify our efforts to give the poor a chance to\r\nenjoy and to join in this Nation's progress.\r\n\r\nI shall propose certain administrative changes suggested by the\r\nCongress--as well as some that we have learned from our own trial and\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nI shall urge special methods and special funds to reach the hundreds of\r\nthousands of Americans that are now trapped in the ghettos of our big\r\ncities and, through Head Start, to try to reach out to our very young,\r\nlittle children. The chance to learn is their brightest hope and must\r\ncommand our full determination. For learning brings skills; and skills\r\nbring jobs; and jobs bring responsibility and dignity, as well as taxes.\r\n\r\nThis war--like the war in Vietnam--is not a simple one. There is no single\r\nbattle-line which you can plot each day on a chart. The enemy is not easy to\r\nperceive, or to isolate, or to destroy. There are mistakes and there are\r\nsetbacks. But we are moving, and our direction is forward.\r\n\r\nThis is true with other programs that are making and breaking new ground.\r\nSome do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all the money\r\nthat could be put into them. Administrative skills and trained manpower are\r\njust as vital to their success as dollars. And I believe those skills will\r\ncome. But it will take time and patience and hard work. Success cannot be\r\nforced at a single stroke. So we must continue to strengthen the\r\nadministration of every program if that success is to come--as we know it\r\nmust.\r\n\r\nWe have done much in the space of 2 short years, working together.\r\n\r\nI have recommended, and you, the Congress, have approved, 10 different\r\nreorganization plans, combining and consolidating many bureaus of this\r\nGovernment, and creating two entirely new Cabinet departments.\r\n\r\nI have come tonight to propose that we establish a new department--a\r\nDepartment of Business and Labor.\r\n\r\nBy combining the Department of Commerce with the Department of Labor and\r\nother related agencies, I think we can create a more economical, efficient,\r\nand streamlined instrument that will better serve a growing nation.\r\n\r\nThis is our goal throughout the entire Federal Government. Every program\r\nwill be thoroughly evaluated. Grant-in-aid programs will be improved and\r\nsimplified as desired by many of our local administrators and our\r\nGovernors.\r\n\r\nWhere there have been mistakes, we will try very hard to correct them.\r\n\r\nWhere there has been progress, we will try to build upon it.\r\n\r\nOur second objective is partnership--to create an effective partnership at\r\nall levels of government. And I should treasure nothing more than to have\r\nthat partnership begin between the executive and the Congress.\r\n\r\nThe 88th and the 89th Congresses passed more social and economic\r\nlegislation than any two single Congresses in American history. Most of you\r\nwho were Members of those Congresses voted to pass most of those measures.\r\nBut your efforts will come to nothing unless it reaches the people.\r\n\r\nFederal energy is essential. But it is not enough. Only a total working\r\npartnership among Federal, State, and local governments can succeed. The\r\ntest of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization,\r\neach private institution, and each responsible citizen.\r\n\r\nEach State, county, and city needs to examine its capacity for government\r\nin today's world, as we are examining ours in the executive department, and\r\nas I see you are examining yours. Some will need to reorganize and reshape\r\ntheir methods of administration--as we are doing. Others will need to revise\r\ntheir constitutions and their laws to bring them up to date--as we are\r\ndoing. Above all, I think we must work together and find ways in which the\r\nmultitudes of small jurisdictions can be brought together more\r\nefficiently.\r\n\r\nDuring the past 3 years we have returned to State and local governments\r\nabout $40 billion in grants-in-aid. This year alone, 70 percent of our\r\nFederal expenditures for domestic programs will be distributed through the\r\nState and local governments. With Federal assistance, State and local\r\ngovernments by 1970 will be spending close to $110 billion annually. These\r\nenormous sums must be used wisely, honestly, and effectively. We intend to\r\nwork closely with the States and the localities to do exactly that.\r\n\r\nOur third objective is priorities, to move ahead on the priorities that we\r\nhave established within the resources that are available.\r\n\r\nI wish, of course, that we could do all that should be done--and that we\r\ncould do it now. But the Nation has many commitments and responsibilities\r\nwhich make heavy demands upon our total resources. No administration would\r\nmore eagerly utilize for these programs all the resources they require than\r\nthe administration that started them.\r\n\r\nSo let us resolve, now, to do all that we can, with what we have--knowing\r\nthat it is far, far more than we have ever done before, and far, far less\r\nthan our problems will ultimately require.\r\n\r\nLet us create new opportunities for our children and our young Americans\r\nwho need special help.\r\n\r\nWe should strengthen the Head Start program, begin it for children 3 years\r\nold, and maintain its educational momentum by following through in the\r\nearly years.\r\n\r\nWe should try new methods of child development and care from the earliest\r\nyears, before it is too late to correct.\r\n\r\nAnd I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.\r\n\r\nLet us insure that older Americans, and neglected Americans, share in their\r\nNation's progress.\r\n\r\nWe should raise social security payments by an overall average of 20\r\npercent. That will add $4 billion 100 million to social security payments\r\nin the first year. I will recommend that each of the 23 million Americans\r\nnow receiving payments get an increase of at least 15 percent.\r\n\r\nI will ask that you raise the minimum payments by 59 percent--from $44 to\r\n$70 a month, and to guarantee a minimum benefit of $100 a month for those\r\nwith a total of 25 years of coverage. We must raise the limits that retired\r\nworkers can earn without losing social security income.\r\n\r\nWe must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nWe should embark upon a major effort to provide self-help assistance to the\r\nforgotten in our midst--the American Indians and the migratory farm\r\nworkers. And we should reach with the hand of understanding to help those\r\nwho live in rural poverty.\r\n\r\nAnd I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.\r\n\r\nSo let us keep on improving the quality of life and enlarging the meaning\r\nof justice for all of our fellow Americans.\r\n\r\nWe should transform our decaying slums into places of decency through the\r\nlandmark Model Cities program. I intend to seek for this effort, this year,\r\nthe full amount that you in Congress authorized last year.\r\n\r\nWe should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced\r\ntechnology to help rebuild our great cities.\r\n\r\nWe should vastly expand the fight for dean air with a total attack on\r\npollution at its sources, and--because air, like water, does not respect\r\nmanmade boundaries--we should set up \"regional airsheds\" throughout this\r\ngreat land.\r\n\r\nWe should continue to carry to every corner of the Nation our campaign for\r\na beautiful America--to dean up our towns, to make them more beautiful, our\r\ncities, our countryside, by creating more parks, and more seashores, and\r\nmore open spaces for our children to play in, and for the generations that\r\ncome after us to enjoy.\r\n\r\nWe should continue to seek equality and justice for each citizen--before a\r\njury, in seeking a job, in exercising his civil rights. We should find a\r\nsolution to fair housing, so that every American, regardless of color, has\r\na decent home of his choice.\r\n\r\nWe should modernize our Selective Service System. The National Commission\r\non Selective Service will shortly submit its report. I will send you new\r\nrecommendations to meet our military manpower needs. But let us resolve\r\nthat this is to be the Congress that made our draft laws as fair and as\r\neffective as possible.\r\n\r\nWe should protect what Justice Brandeis called the \"right most valued by\r\ncivilized men\"--the right to privacy. We should outlaw all\r\nwiretapping--public and private--wherever and whenever it occurs, except\r\nwhen the security of this Nation itself is at stake--and only then with the\r\nstrictest governmental safeguards. And we should exercise the full reach of\r\nour constitutional powers to outlaw electronic \"bugging\" and \"snooping.\"\r\n\r\nI hope this Congress will try to help me do more for the consumer. We\r\nshould demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly expressed\r\nwhere average citizens can understand it. We should immediately take steps\r\nto prevent massive power failures, to safeguard the home against hazardous\r\nhousehold products, and to assure safety in the pipelines that carry\r\nnatural gas across our Nation.\r\n\r\nWe should extend Medicare benefits that are now denied to 1,300,000\r\npermanently and totally disabled Americans under 65 years of age.\r\n\r\nWe should improve the process of democracy by passing our election reform\r\nand financing proposals, by tightening our laws regulating lobbying, and by\r\nrestoring a reasonable franchise to Americans who move their residences.\r\n\r\nWe should develop educational television into a vital public resource to\r\nenrich our homes, educate our families, and to provide assistance in our\r\nclassrooms. We should insist that the public interest be fully served\r\nthrough the public's airwaves.\r\n\r\nAnd I will propose these measures to the 90th Congress.\r\n\r\nNow we come to a question that weighs very heavily on all our minds--on\r\nyours and mine. This Nation must make an all-out effort to combat crime.\r\n\r\nThe 89th Congress gave us a new start in the attack on crime by passing the\r\nLaw Enforcement Assistance Act that I recommended. We appointed the\r\nNational Crime Commission to study crime in America and to recommend the\r\nbest ways to carry that attack forward.\r\n\r\nAnd while we do not have all the answers, on the basis of its preliminary\r\nrecommendations we are ready to move.\r\n\r\nThis is not a war that Washington alone can win. The idea of a national\r\npolice force is repugnant to the American people. Crime must be rooted out\r\nin local communities by local authorities. Our policemen must be better\r\ntrained, must be better paid, and must be better supported by the local\r\ncitizens that they try to serve and to protect.\r\n\r\nThe National Government can and expects to help.\r\n\r\nAnd so I will recommend to the 90th Congress the Safe Streets and Crime\r\nControl Act of 1967. It will enable us to assist those States and cities\r\nthat try to make their streets and homes safer, their police forces better,\r\ntheir corrections systems more effective, and their courts more efficient.\r\n\r\nWhen the Congress approves, the Federal Government will be able to provide\r\na substantial percentage of the cost:\r\n\r\n--90 percent of the cost of developing the State and local plans, master\r\nplans, to combat crime in their area;\r\n\r\n--60 percent of the cost of training new tactical units, developing instant\r\ncommunications and special alarm systems, and introducing the latest\r\nequipment and techniques so that they can become weapons in the war on\r\ncrime;\r\n\r\n--50 percent of the cost of building crime laboratories and police\r\nacademy-type centers so that our citizens can be protected by the best\r\ntrained and served by the best equipped police to be found anywhere. We\r\nwill also recommend new methods to prevent juvenile delinquents from\r\nbecoming adult delinquents. We will seek new partnerships with States and\r\ncities in order to deal with this hideous narcotics problem. And we will\r\nrecommend strict controls on the sale of firearms.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free\r\nAmerica--as Abraham Lincoln once said--must \"let reverence for the\r\nlaws . . . become the political religion of the Nation.\"\r\n\r\nOur country's laws must be respected. Order must be maintained. And I will\r\nsupport--with all the constitutional powers the President possesses--our\r\nNation's law enforcement officials in their attempt to control the crime\r\nand the violence that tear the fabric of our communities.\r\n\r\nMany of these priority proposals will be built on foundations that have\r\nalready been laid. Some will necessarily be small at first, but \"every\r\nbeginning is a consequence.\" If we postpone this urgent work now, it will\r\nsimply have to be done later, and later we will pay a much higher price.\r\n\r\nOur fourth objective is prosperity, to keep our economy moving ahead,\r\nmoving ahead steadily and safely.\r\n\r\nWe have now enjoyed 6 years of unprecedented and rewarding prosperity. Last\r\nyear, in 1966:\r\n\r\n--Wages were the highest in history--and the unemployment rate, announced\r\nyesterday, reached the lowest point in 13 years;\r\n\r\n--Total after-tax income of American families rose nearly 5 percent;\r\n\r\n--Corporate profits after taxes rose a little more than 5 percent;\r\n\r\n--Our gross national product advanced 5.5 percent, to about $740 billion;\r\n\r\n--Income per farm went up 6 percent.\r\n\r\nNow we have been greatly concerned because consumer prices rose 4.5 percent\r\nover the 18 months since we decided to send troops to Vietnam. This was\r\nmore than we had expected--and the Government tried to do everything that\r\nwe knew how to do to hold it down. Yet we were not as successful as we\r\nwished to be. In the 18 months after we entered World War II, prices rose\r\nnot 4.5 percent, but 13.5 percent. In the first 18 months after Korea,\r\nafter the conflict broke out there, prices rose not 4.5 percent, but 11\r\npercent. During those two periods we had OPA price control that the\r\nCongress gave us and War Labor Board wage controls.\r\n\r\nSince Vietnam we have not asked for those controls and we have tried to\r\navoid imposing them. We believe that we have done better, but we make no\r\npretense of having been successful or doing as well as we wished.\r\n\r\nOur greatest disappointment in the economy during 1966 was the excessive\r\nrise in interest rates and the tightening of credit. They imposed very\r\nsevere and very unfair burdens on our home buyers and on our home builders,\r\nand all those associated with the home industry.\r\n\r\nLast January, and again last September, I recommended fiscal and moderate\r\ntax measures to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic expansion.\r\nLegislatively and administratively we took several billions out of the\r\neconomy. With these measures, in both instances, the Congress approved most\r\nof the recommendations rather promptly.\r\n\r\nAs 1966 ended, price stability was seemingly being restored. Wholesale\r\nprices are lower tonight than they were in August. So are retail food\r\nprices. Monetary conditions are also easing. Most interest rates have\r\nretreated from their earlier peaks. More money now seems to be available.\r\n\r\nGiven the cooperation of the Federal Reserve System, which I so earnestly\r\nseek, I am confident that this movement can continue. I pledge the American\r\npeople that I will do everything in a President's power to lower interest\r\nrates and to ease money in this country. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board\r\ntomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to\r\nsavings and loan associations an additional $1 billion, and will lower from\r\n6 percent to 5 3/4 percent the interest rate charged on those loans.\r\n\r\nWe shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that\r\nwe believe will keep our economy growing without new inflationary spirals;\r\nthat will finance responsibly the needs of our men in Vietnam and the\r\nprogress of our people at home; that will support a significant improvement\r\nin our export surplus, and will press forward toward easier credit and\r\ntoward lower interest rates.\r\n\r\nI recommend to the Congress a surcharge of 6 percent on both corporate and\r\nindividual income taxes--to last for 2 years or for so long as the unusual\r\nexpenditures associated with our efforts in Vietnam continue. I will\r\npromptly recommend an earlier termination date if a reduction in these\r\nexpenditures permits it. This surcharge will raise revenues by some $4.5\r\nbillion in the first year. For example, a person whose tax payment, the tax\r\nhe owes, is $1,000, will pay, under this proposal, an extra $60 over the\r\n12-month period, or $5 a month. The overwhelming majority of Americans who\r\npay taxes today are below that figure and they will pay substantially less\r\nthan $5 a month. Married couples with two children, with incomes up to\r\n$5,000 per year, will be exempt from this tax--as will single people with\r\nan income of up to $1,900 a year.\r\n\r\nNow if Americans today still paid the income and excise tax rates in effect\r\nwhen I came into the Presidency, in the year 1964, their annual taxes would\r\nhave been over $20 billion more than at present tax rates. So this proposal\r\nis that while we have this problem and this emergency in Vietnam, while we\r\nare trying to meet the needs of our people at home, your Government asks\r\nfor slightly more than one-fourth of that tax cut each year in order to try\r\nto hold our budget deficit in fiscal 1968 within prudent limits and to give\r\nour country and to give our fighting men the help they need in this hour of\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 1967, we estimate the budget expenditures to be $126.7 billion\r\nand revenues of $117 billion. That will leave us a deficit this year of\r\n$9.7 billion.\r\n\r\nFor fiscal 1968, we estimate budget expenditures of $135 billion. And with\r\nthe tax measures recommended, and a continuing strong economy, we estimate\r\nrevenues will be $126.9 billion. The deficit then will be $8.1 billion.\r\n\r\nI will very soon forward all of my recommendations to the Congress. Yours\r\nis the responsibility to discuss and to debate them--to approve or modify or\r\nreject them.\r\n\r\nI welcome your views, as I have welcomed working with you for 30 years as a\r\ncolleague and as Vice President and President.\r\n\r\nI should like to say to the Members of the opposition--whose numbers, if I\r\nam not mistaken, seem to have increased somewhat--that the genius of the\r\nAmerican political system has always been best expressed through creative\r\ndebate that offers choices and reasonable alternatives. Throughout our\r\nhistory, great Republicans and Democrats have seemed to understand this. So\r\nlet there be light and reason in our relations. That is the way to a\r\nresponsible session and a responsive government.\r\n\r\nLet us be remembered as a President and a Congress who tried to improve the\r\nquality of life for every American--not just the rich, not just the poor,\r\nbut every man, woman, and child in this great Nation of ours.\r\n\r\nWe all go to school--to good schools or bad schools. We all take air into\r\nour lungs--clean air or polluted air. We all drink water--pure water or\r\npolluted water. We all face sickness someday, and some more often than we\r\nwish, and old age as well. We all have a stake in this Great Society--in\r\nits economic growth, in reduction of civil strife--a great stake in good\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWe just must not arrest the pace of progress we have established in this\r\ncountry in these years. Our children's children will pay the price if we\r\nare not wise enough, and courageous enough, and determined enough to stand\r\nup and meet the Nation's needs as well as we can in the time allotted us.\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAbroad, as at home, there is also risk in change. But abroad, as at home,\r\nthere is a greater risk in standing still. No part of our foreign policy is\r\nso sacred that it ever remains beyond review. We shall be flexible where\r\nconditions in the world change--and where man's efforts can change them for\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nWe are in the midst of a great transition--a transition from narrow\r\nnationalism to international partnership; from the harsh spirit of the cold\r\nwar to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a troubled and a threatened\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nIn Latin America, the American chiefs of state will be meeting very shortly\r\nto give our hemispheric policies new direction.\r\n\r\nWe have come a long way in this hemisphere since the inter-American effort\r\nin economic and social development was launched by the conference at Bogota\r\nin 1960 under the leadership of President Eisenhower. The Alliance for\r\nProgress moved dramatically forward under President Kennedy. There is new\r\nconfidence that the voice of the people is being heard; that the dignity of\r\nthe individual is stronger than ever in this hemisphere, and we are facing\r\nup to and meeting many of the hemispheric problems together. In this\r\nhemisphere that reform under democracy can be made to happen--because it\r\nhas happened. So together, I think, we must now move to strike down the\r\nbarriers to full cooperation among the American nations, and to free the\r\nenergies and the resources of two great continents on behalf of all of our\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nAfrica stands at an earlier stage of development than Latin America. It has\r\nyet to develop the transportation, communications, agriculture, and, above\r\nall, the trained men and women without which growth is impossible. There,\r\ntoo, the job will best be done if the nations and peoples of Africa\r\ncooperate on a regional basis. More and more our programs for Africa are\r\ngoing to be directed toward self-help.\r\n\r\nThe future of Africa is shadowed by unsolved racial conflicts. Our policy\r\nwill continue to reflect our basic commitments as a people to support those\r\nwho are prepared to work towards cooperation and harmony between races, and\r\nto help those who demand change but reject the fool's gold of violence.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle East the spirit of good will toward all, unfortunately, has\r\nnot yet taken hold. An already tortured peace seems to be constantly\r\nthreatened. We shall try to use our influence to increase the possibilities\r\nof improved relations among the nations of that region. We are working hard\r\nat that task.\r\n\r\nIn the great subcontinent of South Asia live more than a sixth of the\r\nearth's population. Over the years we--and others--have invested very\r\nheavily in capital and food for the economic development of India and\r\nPakistan.\r\n\r\nWe are not prepared to see our assistance wasted, however, in conflict. It\r\nmust strengthen their capacity to help themselves. It must help these two\r\nnations--both our friends--to overcome poverty, to emerge as self-reliant\r\nleaders, and find terms for reconciliation and cooperation.\r\n\r\nIn Western Europe we shall maintain in NATO an integrated common defense.\r\nBut we also look forward to the time when greater security can be achieved\r\nthrough measures of arms control and disarmament, and through other forms\r\nof practical agreement.\r\n\r\nWe are shaping a new future of enlarged partnership in nuclear affairs, in\r\neconomic and technical cooperation, in trade negotiations, in political\r\nconsultation, and in working together with the governments and peoples of\r\nEastern Europe and the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe emerging spirit of confidence is precisely what we hoped to achieve\r\nwhen we went to work a generation ago to put our shoulder to the wheel and\r\ntry to help rebuild Europe. We faced new challenges and opportunities then\r\nand there--and we faced also some dangers. But I believe that the peoples\r\non both sides of the Atlantic, as well as both sides of this Chamber,\r\nwanted to face them together.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are also in\r\ntransition. We have avoided both the acts and the rhetoric of the cold war.\r\nWhen we have differed with the Soviet Union, or other nations, for that\r\nmatter, I have tried to differ quietly and with courtesy, and without\r\nvenom.\r\n\r\nOur objective is not to continue the cold war, but to end it.\r\n\r\nWe have reached an agreement at the United Nations on the peaceful uses of\r\nouter space.\r\n\r\nWe have agreed to open direct air flights with the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nWe have removed more than 400 nonstrategic items from export control.\r\n\r\nWe are determined that the Export-Import Bank can allow commercial credits\r\nto Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia, as well as to Romania and\r\nYugoslavia.\r\n\r\nWe have entered into a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union for another\r\n2 years.\r\n\r\nWe have agreed with Bulgaria and Hungary to upgrade our legations to\r\nembassies.\r\n\r\nWe have started discussions with international agencies on ways of\r\nincreasing contacts with Eastern European countries.\r\n\r\nThis administration has taken these steps even as duty compelled us to\r\nfulfill and execute alliances and treaty obligations throughout the world\r\nthat were entered into before I became President.\r\n\r\nSo tonight I now ask and urge this Congress to help our foreign and our\r\ncommercial trade policies by passing an East-West trade bill and by\r\napproving our consular convention with the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet Union has in the past year increased its long-range missile\r\ncapabilities. It has begun to place near Moscow a limited antimissile\r\ndefense. My first responsibility to our people is to assure that no nation\r\ncan ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use its nuclear\r\npower as a credible threat against us or against our allies.\r\n\r\nI would emphasize that that is why an important link between Russia and the\r\nUnited States is in our common interest, in arms control and in\r\ndisarmament. We have the solemn duty to slow down the arms race between us,\r\nif that is at all possible, in both conventional and nuclear weapons and\r\ndefenses. I thought we were making some progress in that direction the\r\nfirst few months I was in office. I realize that any additional race would\r\nimpose on our peoples, and on all mankind, for that matter, an additional\r\nwaste of resources with no gain in security to either side.\r\n\r\nI expect in the days ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the\r\nCongress about the possibilities of international agreements bearing\r\ndirectly upon this problem.\r\n\r\nNext to the pursuit of peace, the really greatest challenge to the human\r\nfamily is the race between food supply and population increase. That race\r\ntonight is being lost.\r\n\r\nThe time for rhetoric has clearly passed. The time for concerted action is\r\nhere and we must get on with the job.\r\n\r\nWe believe that three principles must prevail if our policy is to succeed:\r\n\r\nFirst, the developing nations must give highest priority to food\r\nproduction, including the use of technology and the capital of private\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nSecond, nations with food deficits must put more of their resources into\r\nvoluntary family planning programs.\r\n\r\nAnd third, the developed nations must all assist other nations to avoid\r\nstarvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to feed\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nEvery member of the world community now bears a direct responsibility to\r\nhelp bring our most basic human account into balance. IV.\r\n\r\nI come now finally to Southeast Asia--and to Vietnam in particular. Soon I\r\nwill submit to the Congress a detailed report on that situation. Tonight I\r\nwant to just review the essential points as briefly as I can.\r\n\r\nWe are in Vietnam because the United States of America and our allies are\r\ncommitted by the SEATO Treaty to \"act to meet the common danger\" of\r\naggression in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nWe are in Vietnam because an international agreement signed by the United\r\nStates, North Vietnam, and others in 1962 is being systematically violated\r\nby the Communists. That violation threatens the independence of all the\r\nsmall nations in Southeast Asia, and threatens the peace of the entire\r\nregion and perhaps the world.\r\n\r\nWe are there because the people of South Vietnam have as much right to\r\nremain non-Communist--if that is what they choose--as North Vietnam has to\r\nremain Communist.\r\n\r\nWe are there because the Congress has pledged by solemn vote to take all\r\nnecessary measures to prevent further aggression.\r\n\r\nNo better words could describe our present course than those once spoken by\r\nthe great Thomas Jefferson:\r\n\r\n\"It is the melancholy law of human societies to be compelled sometimes to\r\nchoose a great evil in order to ward off a greater.\"\r\n\r\nWe have chosen to fight a limited war in Vietnam in an attempt to prevent a\r\nlarger war--a war almost certain to follow, I believe, if the Communists\r\nsucceed in overrunning and taking over South Vietnam by aggression and by\r\nforce. I believe, and I am supported by some authority, that if they are\r\nnot checked now the world can expect to pay a greater price to check them\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThat is what our statesmen said when they debated this treaty, and that is\r\nwhy it was ratified 82 to 1 by the Senate many years ago.\r\n\r\nYou will remember that we stood in Western Europe 20 years ago. Is there\r\nanyone in this Chamber tonight who doubts that the course of freedom was\r\nnot changed for the better because of the courage of that stand?\r\n\r\nSixteen years ago we and others stopped another kind of aggression--this\r\ntime it was in Korea. Imagine how different Asia might be today if we had\r\nfailed to act when the Communist army of North Korea marched south. The\r\nAsia of tomorrow will be far different because we have said in Vietnam, as\r\nwe said 16 years ago in Korea: \"This far and no further.\"\r\n\r\nI think I reveal no secret when I tell you that we are dealing with a\r\nstubborn adversary who is committed to the use of force and terror to\r\nsettle political questions.\r\n\r\nI wish I could report to you that the conflict is almost over. This I\r\ncannot do. We face more cost, more loss, and more agony. For the end is not\r\nyet. I cannot promise you that it will come this year--or come next year.\r\nOur adversary still believes, I think, tonight, that he can go on fighting\r\nlonger than we can, and longer than we and our allies will be prepared to\r\nstand up and resist.\r\n\r\nOur men in that area--there are nearly 500,000 now--have borne well \"the\r\nburden and the heat of the day.\" Their efforts have deprived the Communist\r\nenemy of the victory that he sought and that he expected a year ago. We\r\nhave steadily frustrated his main forces. General Westmoreland reports that\r\nthe enemy can no longer succeed on the battlefield.\r\n\r\nSo I must say to you that our pressure must be sustained--and will be\r\nsustained--until he realizes that the war he started is costing him more\r\nthan he can ever gain.\r\n\r\nI know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy of\r\n\"accumulating slowly, but inexorably, every kind of material resource\"--of\r\n\"laboriously teaching troops the very elements of their trade.\" That, and\r\npatience--and I mean a great deal of patience.\r\n\r\nOur South Vietnamese allies are also being tested tonight. Because they\r\nmust provide real security to the people living in the countryside. And\r\nthis means reducing the terrorism and the armed attacks which kidnaped and\r\nkilled 26,900 civilians in the last 32 months, to levels where they can be\r\nsuccessfully controlled by the regular South Vietnamese security forces. It\r\nmeans bringing to the villagers an effective civilian government that they\r\ncan respect, and that they can rely upon and that they can participate in,\r\nand that they can have a personal stake in. We hope that government is now\r\nbeginning to emerge.\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot report the desired progress in the pacification effort, the\r\nvery distinguished and able Ambassador, Henry Cabot Lodge, reports that\r\nSouth Vietnam is turning to this task with a new sense of urgency. We can\r\nhelp, but only they can win this part of the war. Their task is to build\r\nand protect a new life in each rural province.\r\n\r\nOne result of our stand in Vietnam is already clear.\r\n\r\nIt is this: The peoples of Asia now know that the door to independence is\r\nnot going to be slammed shut. They know that it is possible for them to\r\nchoose their own national destinies--without coercion.\r\n\r\nThe performance of our men in Vietnam--backed by the American people--has\r\ncreated a feeling of confidence and unity among the independent nations of\r\nAsia and the Pacific. I saw it in their faces in the 19 days that I spent\r\nin their homes and in their countries. Fear of external Communist conquest\r\nin many Asian nations is already subsiding--and with this, the spirit of\r\nhope is rising. For the first time in history, a common outlook and common\r\ninstitutions are already emerging.\r\n\r\nThis forward movement is rooted in the ambitions and the interests of Asian\r\nnations themselves. It was precisely this movement that we hoped to\r\naccelerate when I spoke at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore in April 1965, and I\r\npledged \"a much more massive effort to improve the life of man\" in that\r\npart of the world, in the hope that we could take some of the funds that we\r\nwere spending on bullets and bombs and spend it on schools and production.\r\n\r\nTwenty months later our efforts have produced a new reality: The doors of\r\nthe billion dollar Asian Development Bank that I recommended to the\r\nCongress, and you endorsed almost unanimously, I am proud to tell you are\r\nalready open. Asians are engaged tonight in regional efforts in a dozen new\r\ndirections. Their hopes are high. Their faith is strong. Their confidence\r\nis deep.\r\n\r\nAnd even as the war continues, we shall play our part in carrying forward\r\nthis constructive historic development. As recommended by the Eugene Black\r\nmission, and if other nations will join us, I will seek a special\r\nauthorization from the Congress of $200 million for East Asian regional\r\nprograms.\r\n\r\nWe are eager to turn our resources to peace. Our efforts in behalf of\r\nhumanity I think need not be restricted by any parallel or by any boundary\r\nline. The moment that peace comes, as I pledged in Baltimore, I will ask\r\nthe Congress for funds to join in an international program of\r\nreconstruction and development for all the people of Vietnam--and their\r\ndeserving neighbors who wish our help.\r\n\r\nWe shall continue to hope for a reconciliation between the people of\r\nMainland China and the world community--including working together in all\r\nthe tasks of arms control, security, and progress on which the fate of the\r\nChinese people, like their fellow men elsewhere, depends.\r\n\r\nWe would be the first to welcome a China which decided to respect her\r\nneighbors' rights. We would be the first to applaud her were she to apply\r\nher great energies and intelligence to improving the welfare of her people.\r\nAnd we have no intention of trying to deny her legitimate needs for\r\nsecurity and friendly relations with her neighboring countries.\r\n\r\nOur hope that all of this will someday happen rests on the conviction that\r\nwe, the American people and our allies, will and are going to see Vietnam\r\nthrough to an honorable peace.\r\n\r\nWe will support all appropriate initiatives by the United Nations, and\r\nothers, which can bring the several parties together for unconditional\r\ndiscussions of peace--anywhere, any time. And we will continue to take\r\nevery possible initiative ourselves to constantly probe for peace.\r\n\r\nUntil such efforts succeed, or until the infiltration ceases, or until the\r\nconflict subsides, I think the course of wisdom for this country is that we\r\njust must firmly pursue our present course. We will stand firm in Vietnam.\r\n\r\nI think you know that our fighting men there tonight bear the heaviest\r\nburden of all. With their lives they serve their Nation. We must give them\r\nnothing less than our full support--and we have given them that--nothing\r\nless than the determination that Americans have always given their fighting\r\nmen. Whatever our sacrifice here, even if it is more than $5 a month, it is\r\nsmall compared to their own.\r\n\r\nHow long it will take I cannot prophesy. I only know that the will of the\r\nAmerican people, I think, is tonight being tested.\r\n\r\nWhether we can fight a war of limited objectives over a period of time, and\r\nkeep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other than\r\nourselves; whether we can continue to act with restraint when the\r\ntemptation to \"get it over with\" is inviting but dangerous; whether we can\r\naccept the necessity of choosing \"a great evil in order to ward off a\r\ngreater\"; whether we can do these without arousing the hatreds and the\r\npassions that are ordinarily loosed in time of war--on all these questions\r\nso much turns.\r\n\r\nThe answers will determine not only where we are, but \"whither we are\r\ntending.\"\r\n\r\nA time of testing--yes. And a time of transition. The transition is\r\nsometimes slow; sometimes unpopular; almost always very painful; and often\r\nquite dangerous.\r\n\r\nBut we have lived with danger for a long time before, and we shall live\r\nwith it for a long time yet to come. We know that \"man is born unto\r\ntrouble.\" We also know that this Nation was not forged and did not survive\r\nand grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a great many\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nFor all the disorders that we must deal with, and all the frustrations that\r\nconcern us, and all the anxieties that we are called upon to resolve, for\r\nall the issues we must face with the agony that attends them, let us\r\nremember that \"those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like\r\nmen, undergo the fatigues of supporting it.\"\r\n\r\nBut let us also count not only our burdens but our blessings--for they are\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nAnd let us give thanks to the One who governs us all.\r\n\r\nLet us draw encouragement from the signs of hope--for they, too, are many.\r\n\r\nLet us remember that we have been tested before and America has never been\r\nfound wanting.\r\n\r\nSo with your understanding, I would hope your confidence, and your support,\r\nwe are going to persist--and we are going to succeed.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nLyndon B. Johnson\r\nJanuary 17, 1968\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress, and my fellow\r\nAmericans:\r\n\r\nI was thinking as I was walking down the aisle tonight of what Sam Rayburn\r\ntold me many years ago: The Congress always extends a very warm welcome to\r\nthe President--as he comes in.\r\n\r\nThank all of you very, very much.\r\n\r\nI have come once again to this Chamber--the home of our democracy--to give\r\nyou, as the Constitution requires, \"Information of the State of the\r\nUnion.\"\r\n\r\nI report to you that our country is challenged, at home and abroad:\r\n\r\n--that it is our will that is being tried, not our strength; our sense of\r\npurpose, not our ability to achieve a better America;\r\n\r\n--that we have the strength to meet our every challenge; the physical\r\nstrength to hold the course of decency and compassion at home; and the\r\nmoral strength to support the cause of peace in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd I report to you that I believe, with abiding conviction, that this\r\npeople--nurtured by their deep faith, tutored by their hard lessons, moved\r\nby their high aspirations--have the will to meet the trials that these times\r\nimpose.\r\n\r\nSince I reported to you last January:\r\n\r\n--Three elections have been held in Vietnam--in the midst of war and under\r\nthe constant threat of violence.\r\n\r\n--A President, a Vice President, a House and Senate, and village officials\r\nhave been chosen by popular, contested ballot.\r\n\r\n--The enemy has been defeated in battle after battle.\r\n\r\n--The number of South Vietnamese living in areas under Government\r\nprotection tonight has grown by more than a million since January of last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThese are all marks of progress. Yet:\r\n\r\n--The enemy continues to pour men and material across frontiers and into\r\nbattle, despite his continuous heavy losses.\r\n\r\n--He continues to hope that America's will to persevere can be broken.\r\nWell--he is wrong. America will persevere. Our patience and our\r\nperseverance will match our power. Aggression will never prevail.\r\n\r\nBut our goal is peace--and peace at the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\nRight now we are exploring the meaning of Hanoi's recent statement. There\r\nis no mystery about the questions which must be answered before the bombing\r\nis stopped.\r\n\r\nWe believe that any talks should follow the San Antonio formula that I\r\nstated last September, which said:\r\n\r\n--The bombing would stop immediately if talks would take place promptly and\r\nwith reasonable hopes that they would be productive.\r\n\r\n--And the other side must not take advantage of our restraint as they have\r\nin the past. This Nation simply cannot accept anything less without\r\njeopardizing the lives of our men and of our allies.\r\n\r\nIf a basis for peace talks can be established on the San Antonio\r\nfoundations--and it is my hope and my prayer that they can--we would\r\nconsult with our allies and with the other side to see if a complete\r\ncessation of hostilities--a really true cease-fire--could be made the first\r\norder of business. I will report at the earliest possible moment the\r\nresults of these explorations to the American people.\r\n\r\nI have just recently returned from a very fruitful visit and talks with His\r\nHoliness the Pope and I share his hope--as he expressed it earlier\r\ntoday--that both sides will extend themselves in an effort to bring an end\r\nto the war in Vietnam. I have today assured him that we and our allies will\r\ndo our full part to bring this about.\r\n\r\nSince I spoke to you last January, other events have occurred that have\r\nmajor consequences for world peace.\r\n\r\n--The Kennedy Round achieved the greatest reduction in tariff barriers in\r\nall the history of trade negotiations.\r\n\r\n--The nations of Latin America at Punta del Este resolved to move toward\r\neconomic integration.\r\n\r\n--In Asia, the nations from Korea and Japan to Indonesia and Singapore\r\nworked behind America's shield to strengthen their economies and to broaden\r\ntheir political cooperation.\r\n\r\n--In Africa, from which the distinguished Vice President has just returned,\r\nhe reports to me that there is a spirit of regional cooperation that is\r\nbeginning to take hold in very practical ways.\r\n\r\nThese events we all welcomed. Yet since I last reported to you, we and the\r\nworld have been confronted by a number of crises:\r\n\r\n--During the Arab-Israeli war last June, the hot line between Washington\r\nand Moscow was used for the first time in our history. A cease-fire was\r\nachieved without a major power confrontation.\r\n\r\nNow the nations of the Middle East have the opportunity to cooperate with\r\nAmbassador Jarring's U.N. mission and they have the responsibility to find\r\nthe terms of living together in stable peace and dignity, and we shall do\r\nall in our power to help them achieve that result.\r\n\r\n--Not far from this scene of conflict, a crisis flared on Cyprus involving\r\ntwo peoples who are America's friends: Greece and Turkey. Our very able\r\nrepresentative, Mr. Cyrus Vance, and others helped to ease this tension.\r\n\r\n--Turmoil continues on the mainland of China after a year of violent\r\ndisruption. The radical extremism of their Government has isolated the\r\nChinese people behind their own borders. The United States, however,\r\nremains willing to permit the travel of journalists to both our countries;\r\nto undertake cultural and educational exchanges; and to talk about the\r\nexchange of basic food crop materials.\r\n\r\nSince I spoke to you last, the United States and the Soviet Union have\r\ntaken several important steps toward the goal of international\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\nAs you will remember, I met with Chairman Kosygin at Glassboro and we\r\nachieved if not accord, at least a clearer understanding of our respective\r\npositions after 2 days of meeting.\r\n\r\nBecause we believe the nuclear danger must be narrowed, we have worked with\r\nthe Soviet Union and with other nations to reach an agreement that will\r\nhalt the spread of nuclear weapons. On the basis of communications from\r\nAmbassador Fisher in Geneva this afternoon, I am encouraged to believe that\r\na draft treaty can be laid before the conference in Geneva in the very near\r\nfuture. I hope to be able to present that treaty to the Senate this year\r\nfor the Senate's approval.\r\n\r\nWe achieved, in 1967, a consular treaty with the Soviets, the first\r\ncommercial air agreement between the two countries, and a treaty banning\r\nweapons in outer space. We shall sign, and submit to the Senate shortly, a\r\nnew treaty with the Soviets and with others for the protection of\r\nastronauts.\r\n\r\nSerious differences still remain between us, yet in these relations, we\r\nhave made some progress since Vienna, the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban\r\nmissile crisis.\r\n\r\nBut despite this progress, we must maintain a military force that is\r\ncapable of deterring any threat to this Nation's security, whatever the\r\nmode of aggression. Our choices must not be confined to total war--or to\r\ntotal acquiescence.\r\n\r\nWe have such a military force today. We shall maintain it.\r\n\r\nI wish--with all of my heart--that the expenditures that are necessary to\r\nbuild and to protect our power could all be devoted to the programs of\r\npeace. But until world conditions permit, and until peace is assured,\r\nAmerica's might--and America's bravest sons who wear our Nation's\r\nuniform--must continue to stand guard for all of us--as they gallantly do\r\ntonight in Vietnam and other places in the world.\r\n\r\nYet neither great weapons nor individual courage can provide the conditions\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\nFor two decades America has committed itself against the tyranny of want\r\nand ignorance in the world that threatens the peace. We shall sustain that\r\ncommitment. This year I shall propose:\r\n\r\n--That we launch, with other nations, an exploration of the ocean depths to\r\ntap its wealth, and its energy, and its abundance.\r\n\r\n--That we contribute our fair share to a major expansion of the\r\nInternational Development Association, and to increase the resources of the\r\nAsian Development Bank.\r\n\r\n--That we adopt a prudent aid program, rooted in the principle of\r\nself-help.\r\n\r\n--That we renew and extend the food for freedom program.\r\n\r\nOur food programs have already helped millions avoid the horrors of\r\nfamine.\r\n\r\nBut unless the rapid growth of population in developing countries is\r\nslowed, the gap between rich and poor will widen steadily.\r\n\r\nGovernments in the developing countries must take such facts into\r\nconsideration. We in the United States are prepared to help assist them in\r\nthose efforts.\r\n\r\nBut we must also improve the lives of children already born in the villages\r\nand towns and cities on this earth. They can be taught by great teachers\r\nthrough space communications and the miracle of satellite television--and we\r\nare going to bring to bear every resource of mind and technology to help\r\nmake this dream come true.\r\n\r\nLet me speak now about some matters here at home.\r\n\r\nTonight our Nation is accomplishing more for its people than has ever been\r\naccomplished before. Americans are prosperous as men have never been in\r\nrecorded history. Yet there is in the land a certain restlessness--a\r\nquestioning.\r\n\r\nThe total of our Nation's annual production is now above $800 billion. For\r\n83 months this Nation has been on a steady upward trend of growth.\r\n\r\nAll about them, most American families can see the evidence of growing\r\nabundance: higher paychecks, humming factories, new cars moving down new\r\nhighways. More and more families own their own homes, equipped with more\r\nthan 70 million television sets.\r\n\r\nA new college is founded every week. Today more than half of the high\r\nschool graduates go on to college.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of thousands of fathers and mothers who never completed\r\ngrammar school--who will see their children graduate from college.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, this restlessness?\r\n\r\nBecause when a great ship cuts through the sea, the waters are always\r\nstirred and troubled.\r\n\r\nAnd our ship is moving. It is moving through troubled and new waters; it is\r\nmoving toward new and better shores.\r\n\r\nWe ask now, not how can we achieve abundance?--but how shall we use our\r\nabundance? Not, is there abundance enough for all?--but, how can all share\r\nin our abundance?\r\n\r\nWhile we have accomplished much, much remains for us to meet and much\r\nremains for us to master.\r\n\r\n--In some areas, the jobless rate is still three or four times the national\r\naverage.\r\n\r\n--Violence has shown its face in some of our cities.\r\n\r\n--Crime increases on our streets.\r\n\r\n--Income for farm workers remains far behind that for urban workers; and\r\nparity for our farmers who produce our food is still just a hope--not an\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n--New housing construction is far less than we need--to assure decent\r\nshelter for every family.\r\n\r\n--Hospital and medical costs are high, and they are rising.\r\n\r\n--Many rivers--and the air in many cities--remain badly polluted. And our\r\ncitizens suffer from breathing that air.\r\n\r\nWe have lived with conditions like these for many, many years. But much\r\nthat we once accepted as inevitable, we now find absolutely intolerable.\r\n\r\nIn our cities last summer, we saw how wide is the gulf for some Americans\r\nbetween the promise and the reality of our society.\r\n\r\nWe know that we cannot change all of this in a day. It represents the\r\nbitter consequences of more than three centuries.\r\n\r\nBut the issue is not whether we can change this; the issue is whether we\r\nwill change this.\r\n\r\nWell, I know we can. And I believe we will.\r\n\r\nThis then is the work we should do in the months that are ahead of us in\r\nthis Congress.\r\n\r\nThe first essential is more jobs, useful jobs for tens of thousands who can\r\nbecome productive and can pay their own way.\r\n\r\nOur economy has created 7 1/2 million new jobs in the past 4 years. It is\r\nadding more than a million and a half new jobs this year.\r\n\r\nThrough programs passed by the Congress, job training is being given\r\ntonight to more than a million Americans in this country.\r\n\r\nThis year, the time has come when we must get to those who are last in\r\nline--the hard-core unemployed--the hardest to reach.\r\n\r\nEmployment officials estimate that 500,000 of these persons are now\r\nunemployed in the major cities of America. Our objective is to place these\r\n500,000 in private industry jobs within the next 3 years.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I propose a $2. 1 billion manpower program in the coming fiscal\r\nyear--a 25 percent increase over the current year. Most of this increase\r\nwill be used to start a new partnership between government and private\r\nindustry to train and to hire the hard-core unemployed persons. I know of\r\nno task before us of more importance to us, to the country, or to our\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nAnother essential is to rebuild our cities.\r\n\r\nLast year the Congress authorized $662 million for the Model Cities\r\nprogram. I requested the full amount of that authorization to help meet the\r\ncrisis in the cities of America. But the Congress appropriated only $312\r\nmillion--less than half.\r\n\r\nThis year I urge the Congress to honor my request for model cities funds to\r\nrebuild the centers of American cities by granting us the full amount that\r\nyou in the Congress authorized--$1 billion.\r\n\r\nThe next essential is more housing--and more housing now.\r\n\r\nSurely a nation that can go to the moon can place a decent home within the\r\nreach of its families.\r\n\r\nTherefore we must call together the resources of industry and labor, to\r\nstart building 300,000 housing units for low- and middle-income families\r\nnext year--that is three times more than this year. We must make it\r\npossible for thousands of families to become homeowners, not rent-payers.\r\n\r\nI propose, for the consideration of this Congress, a 10-year campaign to\r\nbuild 6 million new housing units for low and middle-income families. Six\r\nmillion units in the next 10 years. We have built 530,000 the last 10\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBetter health for our children--all of our children--is essential if we are\r\nto have a better America.\r\n\r\nLast year, Medicare, Medicaid, and other new programs that you passed in\r\nthe Congress brought better health to more than 25 million Americans.\r\n\r\nAmerican medicine--with the very strong support and cooperation of public\r\nresources--has produced a phenomenal decline in the death rate from many of\r\nthe dread diseases.\r\n\r\nBut it is a shocking fact that, in saving the lives of babies, America\r\nranks 15th among the nations of the world. And among children, crippling\r\ndefects are often discovered too late for any corrective action. This is a\r\ntragedy that Americans can, and Americans should, prevent.\r\n\r\nI shall, therefore, propose to the Congress a child health program to\r\nprovide, over the next 5 years, for families unable to afford it--access to\r\nhealth services from prenatal care of the mother through the child's first\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWhen we do that you will find it is the best investment we ever made\r\nbecause we will get these diseases in their infancy and we will find a cure\r\nin a great many instances that we can never find by overcrowding our\r\nhospitals when they are grown.\r\n\r\nNow when we act to advance the consumer's cause I think we help every\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nLast year, with very little fanfare the Congress and the executive branch\r\nmoved in that field.\r\n\r\nWe enacted the Wholesome Meat Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Product\r\nSafety Commission, and a law to improve clinical laboratories.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I think, the time has come to complete our unfinished work. The\r\nSenate has already passed the truth-in-lending bill, the fire safety bill,\r\nand the pipeline safety laws.\r\n\r\nTonight I plead with the House to immediately act upon these measures and I\r\nhope take favorable action upon all of them. I call upon the Congress to\r\nenact, without delay, the remainder of the 12 vital consumer protection\r\nlaws that I submitted to the Congress last year.\r\n\r\nI also urge final action on a measure that is already passed by the House\r\nto guard against fraud and manipulation in the Nation's commodity exchange\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThese measures are a pledge to our people--to keep them safe in their homes\r\nand at work, and to give them a fair deal in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nAnd I think we must do more. I propose:\r\n\r\n--New powers for the Federal Trade Commission to stop those who defraud and\r\nwho swindle our public.\r\n\r\n--New safeguards to insure the quality of fish and poultry, and the safety\r\nof our community water supplies.\r\n\r\n--A major study of automobile insurance.\r\n\r\n--Protection against hazardous radiation from television sets and other\r\nelectronic equipment.\r\n\r\nAnd to give the consumer a stronger voice, I plan to appoint a consumer\r\ncounsel in the Justice Department--a lawyer for the American consumer--to\r\nwork directly under the Attorney General, to serve the President's Special\r\nAssistant for Consumer Affairs, and to serve the consumers of this land.\r\n\r\nThis Congress--Democrats and Republicans--can earn the thanks of history.\r\nWe can make this truly a new day for the American consumer, and by giving\r\nhim this protection we can live in history as the consumer-conscious\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nSo let us get on with the work. Let us act soon.\r\n\r\nWe, at every level of the government, State, local, Federal, know that the\r\nAmerican people have had enough of rising crime and lawlessness in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThey recognize that law enforcement is first the duty of local police and\r\nlocal government.\r\n\r\nThey recognize that the frontline headquarters against crime is in the\r\nhome, the church, the city hall and the county courthouse and the\r\nstatehouse--not in the far-removed National Capital of Washington.\r\n\r\nBut the people also recognize that the National Government can and the\r\nNational Government should help the cities and the States in their war on\r\ncrime to the full extent of its resources and its constitutional authority.\r\nAnd this we shall do.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean a national police force. It does mean help and financial\r\nsupport:\r\n\r\n--to develop State and local master plans to combat crime,\r\n\r\n--to provide better training and better pay for police, and\r\n\r\n--to bring the most advanced technology to the war on crime in every city\r\nand every county in America.\r\n\r\nThere is no more urgent business before this Congress than to pass the Safe\r\nStreets Act this year that I proposed last year. That law will provide\r\nthese required funds. They are so critically needed that I have doubled my\r\nrequest under this act to $100 million in fiscal 1969.\r\n\r\nAnd I urge the Congress to stop the trade in mail-order murder, to stop it\r\nthis year by adopting a proper gun control law.\r\n\r\nThis year, I will propose a Drug Control Act to provide stricter penalties\r\nfor those who traffic in LSD and other dangerous drugs with our people.\r\n\r\nI will ask for more vigorous enforcement of all of our drug laws by\r\nincreasing the number of Federal drug and narcotics control officials by\r\nmore than 30 percent. The time has come to stop the sale of slavery to the\r\nyoung. I also request you to give us funds to add immediately 100 assistant\r\nUnited States attorneys throughout the land to help prosecute our criminal\r\nlaws. We have increased our judiciary by 40 percent and we have increased\r\nour prosecutors by 16 percent. The dockets are full of cases because we\r\ndon't have assistant district attorneys to go before the Federal judge and\r\nhandle them. We start these young lawyers at $8,200 a year. And the docket\r\nis clogged because we don't have authority to hire more of them.\r\n\r\nI ask the Congress for authority to hire 100 more. These young men will\r\ngive special attention to this drug abuse, too.\r\n\r\nFinally, I ask you to add 100 FBI agents to strengthen law enforcement in\r\nthe Nation and to protect the individual rights of every citizen.\r\n\r\nA moment ago I spoke of despair and frustrated hopes in the cities where\r\nthe fires of disorder burned last summer. We can--and in time we\r\nwill--change that despair into confidence, and change those frustrations\r\ninto achievements. But violence will never bring progress.\r\n\r\nWe can make progress only by attacking the causes of violence and only\r\nwhere there is civil order founded on justice.\r\n\r\nToday we are helping local officials improve their capacity to deal\r\npromptly with disorders.\r\n\r\nThose who preach disorder and those who preach violence must know that\r\nlocal authorities are able to resist them swiftly, to resist them sternly,\r\nand to resist them decisively.\r\n\r\nI shall recommend other actions:\r\n\r\n--To raise the farmers' income by establishing a security commodity reserve\r\nthat will protect the market from price-depressing stocks and protect the\r\nconsumer from food scarcity.\r\n\r\n--I shall recommend programs to help farmers bargain more effectively for\r\nfair prices.\r\n\r\n--I shall recommend programs for new air safety measures.\r\n\r\n--Measures to stem the rising costs of medical care.\r\n\r\n--Legislation to encourage our returning veterans to devote themselves to\r\ncareers in community service such as teaching, and being firemen, and\r\njoining our police force, and our law enforcement officials.\r\n\r\n--I shall recommend programs to strengthen and finance our anti-pollution\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n--Fully funding all of the $2.18 billion poverty program that you in the\r\nCongress had just authorized in order to bring opportunity to those who\r\nhave been left far behind.\r\n\r\n--I shall recommend an Educational Opportunity Act to speed up our drive to\r\nbreak down the financial barriers that are separating our young people from\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\nI shall also urge the Congress to act on several other vital pending\r\nbills--especially the civil rights measures--fair jury trials, protection\r\nof Federal rights, enforcement of equal employment opportunity, and fair\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\nThe unfinished work of the first session must be completed--the Higher\r\nEducation Act, the Juvenile Delinquency Act, conservation measures to save\r\nthe redwoods of California, and to preserve the wonders of our scenic\r\nrivers, the Highway Beautification Act--and all the other measures for a\r\ncleaner, and for a better, and for a more beautiful America.\r\n\r\nNext month we'll begin our 8th year of uninterrupted prosperity. The\r\neconomic outlook for this year is one of steady growth--if we are vigilant.\r\n\r\nTrue, there are some clouds on the horizon. Prices are rising. Interest\r\nrates have passed the peak of 1966; and if there is continued inaction on\r\nthe tax bill, they will climb even higher.\r\n\r\nI warn the Congress and the Nation tonight that this failure to act on the\r\ntax bill will sweep us into an accelerating spiral of price increases, a\r\nslump in homebuilding, and a continuing erosion of the American dollar.\r\n\r\nThis would be a tragedy for every American family. And I predict that if\r\nthis happens, they will all let us know about it.\r\n\r\nWe--those of us in the executive branch, in the Congress, and the leaders\r\nof labor and business--must do everything we can to prevent that kind of\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nUnder the new budget, the expenditures for 1969 will increase by $10.4\r\nbillion. Receipts will increase by $22.3 billion including the added tax\r\nrevenues. Virtually all of this expenditure increase represents the\r\nmandatory cost of our defense efforts, $3 billion; increased interest,\r\nalmost $1 billion; or mandatory payments under laws passed by\r\nCongress--such as those provided in the Social Security Act that you passed\r\nin 1967, and to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, veterans, and farmers,\r\nof about $4 1/2 billion; and the additional $1 billion 600 million next\r\nyear for the pay increases that you passed in military and civilian pay.\r\nThat makes up the $10 billion that is added to the budget. With few\r\nexceptions, very few, we are holding the fiscal 1969 budget to last year's\r\nlevel, outside of those mandatory and required increases.\r\n\r\nA Presidential commission composed of distinguished congressional fiscal\r\nleaders and other prominent Americans recommended this year that we adopt a\r\nnew budget approach. I am carrying out their recommendations in this year's\r\nbudget. This budget, therefore, for the first time accurately covers all\r\nFederal expenditures and all Federal receipts, including for the first time\r\nin one budget $47 billion from the social security, Medicare, highway, and\r\nother trust funds.\r\n\r\nThe fiscal 1969 budget has expenditures of approximately $186 billion, with\r\ntotal estimated revenues, including the tax bill, of about $178 billion.\r\n\r\nIf the Congress enacts the tax increase, we will reduce the budget deficit\r\nby some $12 billion. The war in Vietnam is costing us about $25 billion and\r\nwe are asking for about $12 billion in taxes--and if we get that $12\r\nbillion tax bill we will reduce the deficit from about $20 billion in 1968\r\nto about $8 billion in 1969.\r\n\r\nNow, this is a tight budget. It follows the reduction that I made in\r\ncooperation with the Congress--a reduction made after you had reviewed\r\nevery appropriations bill and reduced the appropriations by some $5 or $6\r\nbillion and expenditures by $1.5 billion. We conferred together and I\r\nrecommended to the Congress and you subsequently approved taking 2 percent\r\nfrom payrolls and 10 percent from controllable expenditures. We therefore\r\nreduced appropriations almost $10 billion last session and expenditures\r\nover $4 billion. Now, that was in the budget last year.\r\n\r\nI ask the Congress to recognize that there are certain selected programs\r\nthat meet the Nation's most urgent needs and they have increased. We have\r\ninsisted that decreases in very desirable but less urgent programs be made\r\nbefore we would approve any increases. So I ask the Congress tonight:\r\n\r\n--to hold its appropriations to the budget requests, and\r\n\r\n--to act responsibly early this year by enacting the tax surcharge which\r\nfor the average American individual amounts to about a penny out of each\r\ndollar's income.\r\n\r\nThis tax increase would yield about half of the $23 billion per year that\r\nwe returned to the people in the tax reduction bills of 1964 and 1965.\r\n\r\nThis must be a temporary measure, which expires in less than 2 years.\r\nCongress can repeal it sooner if the need has passed. But Congress can\r\nnever repeal inflation.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of American business and the leaders of American labor--those\r\nwho really have power over wages and prices--must act responsibly, and in\r\ntheir Nation's interest by keeping increases in line with productivity. If\r\nour recognized leaders do not do this, they and those for whom they speak\r\nand all of us are going to suffer very serious consequences.\r\n\r\nOn January 1st, I outlined a program to reduce our balance of payments\r\ndeficit sharply this year. We will ask the Congress to help carry out those\r\nparts of the program which require legislation. We must restore equilibrium\r\nto our balance of payments.\r\n\r\nWe must also strengthen the international monetary system. We have assured\r\nthe world that America's full gold stock stands behind our commitment to\r\nmaintain the price of gold at $35 an ounce. We must back this commitment by\r\nlegislating now to free our gold reserves.\r\n\r\nAmericans, traveling more than any other people in history, took $4 billion\r\nout of their country last year in travel costs. We must try to reduce the\r\ntravel deficit that we have of more than $2 billion. We are hoping that we\r\ncan reduce it by $500 million--without unduly penalizing the travel of\r\nteachers, students, business people who have essential and necessary\r\ntravel, or people who have relatives abroad whom they want to see. Even\r\nwith this reduction of $500 million, the American people will still be\r\ntraveling more overseas than they did in 1967, 1966, or 1965 or any other\r\nyear in their history.\r\n\r\nIf we act together as I hope we can, I believe we can continue our economic\r\nexpansion which has already broken all past records. And I hope that we can\r\ncontinue that expansion in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nEach of these questions I have discussed with you tonight is a question of\r\npolicy for our people. Therefore, each of them should be--and doubtless\r\nwill be--debated by candidates for public office this year.\r\n\r\nI hope those debates will be marked by new proposals and by a seriousness\r\nthat matches the gravity of the questions themselves.\r\n\r\nThese are not appropriate subjects for narrow partisan oratory. They go to\r\nthe heart of what we Americans are all about--all of us, Democrats and\r\nRepublicans.\r\n\r\nTonight I have spoken of some of the goals I should like to see America\r\nreach. Many of them can be achieved this year--others by the time we\r\ncelebrate our Nation's 200th birthday--the bicentennial of our\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these goals are going to be very hard to reach. But the State of\r\nour Union will be much stronger 8 years from now on our 200th birthday if\r\nwe resolve to reach these goals now. They are more important--much more\r\nimportant--than the identity of the party or the President who will then be\r\nin office.\r\n\r\nThese goals are what the fighting and our alliances are really meant to\r\nprotect.\r\n\r\nCan we achieve these goals?\r\n\r\nOf course we can--if we will.\r\n\r\nIf ever there was a people who sought more than mere abundance, it is our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIf ever there was a nation that was capable of solving its problems, it is\r\nthis Nation.\r\n\r\nIf ever there were a time to know the pride and the excitement and the hope\r\nof being an American--it is this time.\r\n\r\nSo this, my friends, is the State of our Union: seeking, building, tested\r\nmany times in this past year--and always equal to the test.\r\n\r\nThank you and good night.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nLyndon B. Johnson\r\nJanuary 14, 1969\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress and my fellow\r\nAmericans:\r\n\r\nFor the sixth and the last time, I present to the Congress my assessment of\r\nthe State of the Union.\r\n\r\nI shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunity--and about the\r\ncommitments that all of us have made together that will, if we carry them\r\nout, give America our best chance to achieve the kind of great society that\r\nwe all want. Every President lives, not only with what is, but with what\r\nhas been and what could be.\r\n\r\nMost of the great events in his Presidency are part of a larger sequence\r\nextending back through several years and extending back through several\r\nother administrations.\r\n\r\nUrban unrest, poverty, pressures on welfare, education of our people, law\r\nenforcement and law and order, the continuing crisis in the Middle East,\r\nthe conflict in Vietnam, the dangers of nuclear war, the great difficulties\r\nof dealing with the Communist powers, all have this much in common: They\r\nand their causes--the causes that gave rise to them--all of these have\r\nexisted with us for many years. Several Presidents have already sought to\r\ntry to deal with them. One or more Presidents will try to resolve them or\r\ntry to contain them in the years that are ahead of us.\r\n\r\nBut if the Nation's problems are continuing, so are this great Nation's\r\nassets:\r\n\r\n--our economy,\r\n\r\n--the democratic system,\r\n\r\n--our sense of exploration, symbolized most recently by the wonderful\r\nflight of the Apollo 8, in which all Americans took great pride,\r\n\r\n--the good commonsense and sound judgment of the American people, and\r\n\r\n--their essential love of justice.\r\n\r\nWe must not ignore our problems. But .neither should we ignore our\r\nstrengths. Those strengths are available to sustain a President of either\r\nparty--to support his progressive efforts both at home and overseas.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the departure of an administration does not mean the end of\r\nthe problems that this administration has faced. The effort to meet the\r\nproblems must go on, year after year, if the momentum that we have all\r\nmounted together in these past years is not to be lost.\r\n\r\nAlthough the struggle for progressive change is continuous, there are times\r\nwhen a watershed is reached--when there is--if not really a break with the\r\npast--at least the fulfillment of many of its oldest hopes, and a stepping\r\nforth into a new environment, to seek new goals. I think the past 5 years\r\nhave been such a time.\r\n\r\nWe have finished a major part of the old agenda.\r\n\r\nSome of the laws that we wrote have already, in front of our eyes, taken on\r\nthe flesh of achievement.\r\n\r\nMedicare that we were unable to pass for so many years is now a part of\r\nAmerican life.\r\n\r\nVoting rights and the voting booth that we debated so long back in the\r\nriffles, and the doors to public service, are open at last to all Americans\r\nregardless of their color.\r\n\r\nSchools and school children all over America tonight are receiving Federal\r\nassistance to go to good schools.\r\n\r\nPreschool education--Head Start--is already here to stay and, I think, so\r\nare the Federal programs that tonight are keeping more than a million and a\r\nhalf of the cream of our young people in the colleges and the universities\r\nof this country.\r\n\r\nPart of the American earth--not only in description on a map, but in the\r\nreality of our shores, our hills, our parks, our forests, and our\r\nmountains--has been permanently set aside for the American public and for\r\ntheir benefit. And there is more that will be set aside before this\r\nadministration ends.\r\n\r\nFive million Americans have been trained for jobs in new Federal programs.\r\n\r\nI think it is most important that we all realize tonight that this Nation\r\nis close to full employment--with less unemployment than we have had at any\r\ntime in almost 20 years. That is not in theory; that is in fact. Tonight,\r\nthe unemployment rate is down to 3.3 percent. The number of jobs has grown\r\nmore than 8 1/2 million in the last 5 years. That is more than in all the\r\npreceding 12 years.\r\n\r\nThese achievements completed the full cycle, from idea to enactment and,\r\nfinally, to a place in the lives of citizens all across this country.\r\n\r\nI wish it were possible to say that everything that this Congress and the\r\nadministration achieved during this period had already completed that\r\ncycle. But a great deal of what we have committed needs additional funding\r\nto become a tangible realization.\r\n\r\nYet the very existence of these commitments--these promises to the American\r\npeople, made by this Congress and by the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment--are achievements in themselves, and failure to carry through on\r\nour commitments would be a tragedy for this Nation.\r\n\r\nThis much is certain: No one man or group of men made these commitments\r\nalone. Congress and the executive branch, with their checks and balances,\r\nreasoned together and finally wrote them into the law of the land. They now\r\nhave all the moral force that the American political system can summon when\r\nit acts as one.\r\n\r\nThey express America's common determination to achieve goals. They imply\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, you have already begun that action--but it is not fully\r\ncompleted, of course.\r\n\r\nLet me speak for a moment about these commitments. I am going to speak in\r\nthe language which the Congress itself spoke when it passed these measures.\r\nI am going to quote from your words.\r\n\r\nIn 1966, Congress declared that \"improving the quality of urban life is the\r\nmost critical domestic problem facing the United States.\" Two years later\r\nit affirmed the historic goal of \"a decent home . . . for every American\r\nfamily.\" That is your language.\r\n\r\nNow to meet these commitments, we must increase our support for the model\r\ncities program, where blueprints of change are already being prepared in\r\nmore than 150 American cities.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the goals of the Housing Act of 1968 that you have already\r\npassed, we should begin this year more than 500,000 homes for needy\r\nfamilies in the coming fiscal year. Funds are provided in the new budget to\r\ndo just this. This is almost 10 times--10 times--the average rate of the\r\npast 10 years.\r\n\r\nOur cities and our towns are being pressed for funds to meet the needs of\r\ntheir growing populations. So I believe an urban development bank should be\r\ncreated by the Congress. This bank could obtain resources through the\r\nissuance of taxable bonds and it could then lend these resources at reduced\r\nrates to the communities throughout the land for schools, hospitals, parks,\r\nand other public facilities.\r\n\r\nSince we enacted the Social Security Act back in 1935, Congress has\r\nrecognized the necessity to \"make more adequate provision for aged persons\r\n. . . through maternal and child welfare . . . and public health.\" Those\r\nare the words of the Congress--\"more adequate.\"\r\n\r\nThe time has come, I think, to make it more adequate. I believe we should\r\nincrease social security benefits, and I am so recommending tonight.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting that there should be an overall increase in benefits of at\r\nleast 13 percent. Those who receive only the minimum of $55 should get $80\r\na month.\r\n\r\nOur Nation, too, is rightfully proud of our medical advances. But we should\r\nremember that our country ranks 15th among the nations of the world in its\r\ninfant mortality rate.\r\n\r\nI think we should assure decent medical care for every expectant mother and\r\nfor their children during the first year of their life in the United States\r\nof America.\r\n\r\nI think we should protect our children and their families from the costs of\r\ncatastrophic illness.\r\n\r\nAs we pass on from medicine, I think nothing is clearer to the Congress\r\nthan the commitment that the Congress made to end poverty. Congress\r\nexpressed it well, I think, in 1964, when they said: \"It is the policy of\r\nthe United States to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of\r\nplenty in this nation.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the richest nation in the world. The antipoverty program has had\r\nmany achievements. It also has some failures. But we must not cripple it\r\nafter only 3 years of trying to solve the human problems that have been\r\nwith us and have been building up among us for generations.\r\n\r\nI believe the Congress this year will want to improve the administration of\r\nthe poverty program by reorganizing portions of it and transferring them to\r\nother agencies. I believe, though, it will want to continue, until we have\r\nbroken the back of poverty, the efforts we are now making throughout this\r\nland.\r\n\r\nI believe, and I hope the next administration--I believe they believe--that\r\nthe key to success in this effort is jobs. It is work for people who want\r\nto work.\r\n\r\nIn the budget for fiscal 1970, I shall recommend a total of $3.5 billion\r\nfor our job training program, and that is five times as much as we spent in\r\n1964 trying to prepare Americans where they can work to earn their own\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nThe Nation's commitment in the field of civil rights began with the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. They were extended by the 13th, 14th, and 15th\r\namendments. They have been powerfully strengthened by the enactment of\r\nthree far-reaching civil rights laws within the past 5 years, that this\r\nCongress, in its wisdom, passed.\r\n\r\nOn January 1 of this year, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 covered over 20\r\nmillion American homes and apartments. The prohibition against racial\r\ndiscrimination in that act should be remembered and it should be vigorously\r\nenforced throughout this land.\r\n\r\nI believe we should also extend the vital provisions of the Voting Rights\r\nAct for another 5 years.\r\n\r\nIn the Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress determined \"To assist state and\r\nlocal governments in reducing the incidence of crime.\"\r\n\r\nThis year I am proposing that the Congress provide the full $300 million\r\nthat the Congress last year authorized to do just that.\r\n\r\nI hope the Congress will put the money where the authorization is.\r\n\r\nI believe this is an essential contribution to justice and to public order\r\nin the United States. I hope these grants can be made to the States and\r\nthey can be used effectively to reduce the crime rate in this country.\r\n\r\nBut all of this is only a small part of the total effort that must be\r\nmade--I think chiefly by the local governments throughout the Nation--if we\r\nexpect to reduce the toll of crime that we all detest.\r\n\r\nFrankly, as I leave the Office of the Presidency, one of my greatest\r\ndisappointments is our failure to secure passage of a licensing and\r\nregistration act for firearms. I think if we had passed that act, it would\r\nhave reduced the incidence of crime. I believe that the Congress should\r\nadopt such a law, and I hope that it will at a not too distant date.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet our long-standing commitment to make government as\r\nefficient as possible, I believe that we should reorganize our postal\r\nsystem along the lines of the Kappel[1] report.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Frederick R. Kappel, Chairman of the Commission on Executive,\r\nLegislative and Judicial Salaries.]\r\n\r\nI hope we can all agree that public service should never impose an\r\nunreasonable financial sacrifice on able men and women who want to serve\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\nI believe that the recommendations of the Commission on Executive,\r\nLegislative and Judicial Salaries are generally sound. Later this week, I\r\nshall submit a special message which I reviewed with the leadership this\r\nevening containing a proposal that has been reduced and has modified the\r\nCommission's recommendation to some extent on the congressional salaries.\r\n\r\nFor Members of Congress, I will recommend the basic compensation not of the\r\n$50,000 unanimously recommended by the Kappel Commission and the other\r\ndistinguished Members, but I shall reduce that $50,000 to $42,500. I will\r\nsuggest that Congress appropriate a very small additional allowance for\r\nofficial expenses, so that Members will not be required to use their salary\r\nincrease for essential official business.\r\n\r\nI would have submitted the Commission's recommendations, except the advice\r\nthat I received from the leadership--and you usually are consulted about\r\nmatters that affect the Congress--was that the Congress would not accept\r\nthe $50,000 recommendation, and if I expected my recommendation to be\r\nseriously considered, I should make substantial reductions. That is the\r\nonly reason I didn't go along with the Kappel report.\r\n\r\nIn 1967 I recommended to the Congress a fair and impartial random selection\r\nsystem for the draft. I submit it again tonight for your most respectful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nI know that all of us recognize that most of the things we do to meet all\r\nof these commitments I talk about will cost money. If we maintain the\r\nstrong rate of growth that we have had in this country for the past 8\r\nyears, I think we shall generate the resources that we need to meet these\r\ncommitments.\r\n\r\nWe have already been able to increase our support for major social\r\nprograms--although we have heard a lot about not being able to do anything\r\non the home front because of Vietnam; but we have been able in the last\r\n5 years to increase our commitments for such things as health and education\r\nfrom $30 billion in 1964 to $68 billion in the coming fiscal year. That is\r\nmore than double. That is more than it has ever been increased in the 188\r\nyears of this Republic, notwithstanding Vietnam.\r\n\r\nWe must continue to budget our resources and budget them responsibly in a\r\nway that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar.\r\n\r\nGreater revenues and the reduced Federal spending required by Congress last\r\nyear have changed the budgetary picture dramatically since last January\r\nwhen we made our estimates. At that time, you will remember that we\r\nestimated we would have a deficit of $8 billion. Well, I am glad to report\r\nto you tonight that the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, this June, we are\r\ngoing to have not a deficit, but we are going to have a $2.4 billion\r\nsurplus.\r\n\r\nYou will receive the budget tomorrow. The budget for the next fiscal year,\r\nthat begins July 1--which you will want to examine very carefully in the\r\ndays ahead--will provide a $3.4 billion surplus.\r\n\r\nThis budget anticipates the extension of the surtax that Congress enacted\r\nlast year. I have communicated with the President-elect, Mr. Nixon, in\r\nconnection with this policy of continuing the surtax for the time being.\r\n\r\nI want to tell you that both of us want to see it removed just as soon as\r\ncircumstances will permit, but the President-elect has told me that he has\r\nconcluded that until his administration, and this Congress, can examine the\r\nappropriation bills, and each item in the budget, and can ascertain that\r\nthe facts justify permitting the surtax to expire or to be reduced, he, Mr.\r\nNixon, will support my recommendation that the surtax be continued.\r\n\r\nAmericans, I believe, are united in the hope that the Paris talks will\r\nbring an early peace to Vietnam. And if our hopes for an early settlement\r\nof the war are realized, then our military expenditures can be reduced and\r\nvery substantial savings can be made to be used for other desirable\r\npurposes, as the Congress may determine.\r\n\r\nIn any event, I think it is imperative that we do all that we responsibly\r\ncan to resist inflation while maintaining our prosperity. I think all\r\nAmericans know that our prosperity is broad and it is deep, and it has\r\nbrought record profits, the highest in our history, and record wages.\r\n\r\nOur gross national product has grown more in the last 5 years than any\r\nother period in our Nation's history. Our wages have been the highest. Our\r\nprofits have been the best. This prosperity has enabled millions to escape\r\nthe poverty that they would have otherwise had the last few years.\r\n\r\nI think also you will be very glad to hear that the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury informs me tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payments we have\r\nachieved a surplus. It appears that we have, in fact, done better this year\r\nthan we have done in any year in this regard since the year 1957.\r\n\r\nThe quest for a durable peace, I think, has absorbed every administration\r\nsince the end of World War II. It has required us to seek a limitation of\r\narms races not only among the superpowers, but among the smaller nations as\r\nwell. We have joined in the test ban treaty of 1963, the outer space treaty\r\nof 1967, and the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapons in 1968.\r\n\r\nThis latter agreement--the nonproliferation treaty--is now pending in the\r\nSenate and it has been pending there since last July. In my opinion, delay\r\nin ratifying it is not going to be helpful to the cause of peace. America\r\ntook the lead in negotiating this treaty and America should now take steps\r\nto have it approved at the earliest possible date.\r\n\r\nUntil a way can be found to scale down the level of arms among the\r\nsuperpowers, mankind cannot view the future without fear and great\r\napprehension. So, I believe that we should resume the talks with the Soviet\r\nUnion about limiting offensive and defensive missile systems. I think they\r\nwould already have been resumed except for Czechoslovakia and our election\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\nIt was more than 20 years ago that we embarked on a program of trying to\r\naid the developing nations. We knew then that we could not live in good\r\nconscience as a rich enclave on an earth that was seething in misery.\r\n\r\nDuring these years there have been great advances made under our program,\r\nparticularly against want and hunger, although we are disappointed at the\r\nappropriations last year. We thought they were woefully inadequate. This\r\nyear I am asking for adequate funds for economic assistance in the hope\r\nthat we can further peace throughout the world.\r\n\r\nI think we must continue to support efforts in regional cooperation. Among\r\nthose efforts, that of Western Europe has a very special place in America's\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nThe only course that is going to permit Europe to play the great world role\r\nthat its resources permit is to go forward to unity. I think America\r\nremains ready to work with a united Europe, to work as a partner on the\r\nbasis of equality.\r\n\r\nFor the future, the quest for peace, I believe, requires:\r\n\r\n--that we maintain the liberal trade policies that have helped us become\r\nthe leading nation in world trade,\r\n\r\n--that we strengthen the international monetary system as an instrument of\r\nworld prosperity, and\r\n\r\n--that we seek areas of agreement with the Soviet Union where the interests\r\nof both nations and the interests of world peace are properly served.\r\n\r\nThe strained relationship between us and the world's leading Communist\r\npower has not ended--especially in the light of the brutal invasion of\r\nCzechoslovakia. But totalitarianism is no less odious to us because we are\r\nable to reach some accommodation that reduces the danger of world\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nWhat we do, we do in the interest of peace in the world. We earnestly hope\r\nthat time will bring a Russia that is less afraid of diversity and\r\nindividual freedom.\r\n\r\nThe quest for peace tonight continues in Vietnam, and in the Paris talks.\r\n\r\nI regret more than any of you know that it has not been possible to restore\r\npeace to South Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThe prospects, I think, for peace are better today than at any time since\r\nNorth Vietnam began its invasion with its regular forces more than 4 years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThe free nations of Asia know what they were not sure of at that time: that\r\nAmerica cares about their freedom, and it also cares about America's own\r\nvital interests in Asia and throughout the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe North Vietnamese know that they cannot achieve their aggressive\r\npurposes by force. There may be hard fighting before a settlement is\r\nreached; but, I can assure you, it will yield no victory to the Communist\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nI cannot speak to you tonight about Vietnam without paying a very personal\r\ntribute to the men who have carried the battle out there for all of us. I\r\nhave been honored to be their Commander in Chief. The Nation owes them its\r\nunstinting support while the battle continues--and its enduring gratitude\r\nwhen their service is done.\r\n\r\nFinally, the quest for stable peace in the Middle East goes on in many\r\ncapitals tonight. America fully supports the unanimous resolution of the\r\nU.N. Security Council which points the way. There must be a settlement of\r\nthe armed hostility that exists in that region of the world today. It is a\r\nthreat not only to Israel and to all the Arab States, but it is a threat to\r\nevery one of us and to the entire world as well.\r\n\r\nNow, my friends in Congress, I want to conclude with a few very personal\r\nwords to you.\r\n\r\nI rejected and rejected and then finally accepted the congressional\r\nleadership's invitation to come here to speak this farewell to you in\r\nperson tonight.\r\n\r\nI did that for two reasons. One was philosophical. I wanted to give you my\r\njudgment, as I saw it, on some of the issues before our Nation, as I view\r\nthem, before I leave.\r\n\r\nThe other was just pure sentimental. Most all of my life as a public\r\nofficial has been spent here in this building. For 38 years--since I worked\r\non that gallery as a doorkeeper in the House of Representatives--I have\r\nknown these halls, and I have known most of the men pretty well who walked\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI know the questions that you face. I know the conflicts that you endure. I\r\nknow the ideals that you seek to serve.\r\n\r\nI left here first to become Vice President, and then to become, in a moment\r\nof tragedy, the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nMy term of office has been marked by a series of challenges, both at home\r\nand throughout the world.\r\n\r\nIn meeting some of these challenges, the Nation has found a new confidence.\r\nIn meeting others, it knew turbulence and doubt, and fear and hate.\r\n\r\nThroughout this time, I have been sustained by my faith in representative\r\ndemocracy--a faith that I had learned here in this Capitol Building as an\r\nemployee and as a Congressman and as a Senator.\r\n\r\nI believe deeply in the ultimate purposes of this Nation--described by the\r\nConstitution, tempered by history, embodied in progressive laws, and given\r\nlife by men and women that have been elected to serve their fellow\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nNow for 5 most demanding years in the White House, I have been strengthened\r\nby the counsel and the cooperation of two great former Presidents, Harry S.\r\nTruman and Dwight David Eisenhower. I have been guided by the memory of my\r\npleasant and close association with the beloved John F. Kennedy, and with\r\nour greatest modern legislator, Speaker Sam Rayburn.\r\n\r\nI have been assisted by my friend every step of the way, Vice President\r\nHubert Humphrey. I am so grateful that I have been supported daily by the\r\nloyalty of Speaker McCormack and Majority Leader Albert.\r\n\r\nI have benefited from the wisdom of Senator Mike Mansfield, and I am sure\r\nthat I have avoided many dangerous pitfalls by the good commonsense counsel\r\nof the President Pro Tem of the Senate, Senator Richard Brevard Russell.\r\n\r\nI have received the most generous cooperation from the leaders of the\r\nRepublican Party in the Congress of the United States, Senator Dirksen and\r\nCongressman Gerald Ford, the Minority Leader.\r\n\r\nNo President should ask for more, although I did upon occasions. But few\r\nPresidents have ever been blessed with so much.\r\n\r\nPresident-elect Nixon, in the days ahead, is going to need your\r\nunderstanding, just as I did. And he is entitled to have it. I hope every\r\nMember will remember that the burdens he will bear as our President, will\r\nbe borne for all of us. Each of us should try not to increase these burdens\r\nfor the sake of narrow personal or partisan advantage.\r\n\r\nNow, it is time to leave. I hope it may be said, a hundred years from now,\r\nthat by working together we helped to make our country more just, more just\r\nfor all of its people, as well as to insure and guarantee the blessings of\r\nliberty for all of our posterity.\r\n\r\nThat is what I hope. But I believe that at least it will be said that we\r\ntried.",
