V.--JANUARY, 1864.--No. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRETROSPECTIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime makes many dark things clear, and often in a wonderfully short and\r\ndecisive way. So we said hopefully two years and more ago in regard to\r\none of the unsolved problems which then pressed on the minds of\r\nthoughtful men--how, namely, it was to fare with slavery in the progress\r\nand sequel of the war. The history of our national struggle has\r\nillustrated the truth and justified the hope. Time has quite nearly\r\nsolved that problem and some others almost equally perplexing. The\r\nstream of historical causes has borne the nation onward on the bosom of\r\nits inevitable flow, until we can now almost see clear through to the\r\nend; at any rate, we have reached a point where we can look backward and\r\nforward with perhaps greater advantage than at any former period. What\r\nchanges of opinion have been wrought! How many doubts resolved! How many\r\nfears dispelled! How many old prejudices and preconceived notions have\r\nbeen abandoned! How many vexed questions put at rest! How many things\r\nhave safely got an established place among accepted and almost generally\r\nacceptable facts, which were once matters of loyal foreboding and of\r\ndisloyal denunciation! No man of good sense and loyalty now doubts the\r\nrightfulness and wisdom of depriving the rebels of the aid derived from\r\ntheir slaves, and making them an element of strength on our side; while\r\nthe fact that the enfranchised slaves make good soldiers, is put beyond\r\nquestion by an amenability to military discipline and a bravery in\r\nbattle not surpassed by any troops in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAS THE WAR GONE SLOWLY?\r\n\r\nThe work of subduing the rebellion has gone slowly as compared with the\r\nimpatient demands of an indignant people at the outset; but not slowly\r\nif you consider the vast theatre of the war, the immense extent of the\r\nlines of military operations, and the prodigious advantages possessed by\r\nthe rebels at the beginning--partly advantages such as always attend the\r\nfirst outbreak of a revolutionary conspiracy long matured in secret\r\nagainst an unsuspecting and unprepared Government, and partly the\r\nextraordinary and peculiar advantages that accrued to them from the\r\ntraitorous complicity of Buchanan's Administration, through which the\r\nconspirators were enabled to rob the national treasury, strip the\r\nGovernment of arms, and possess themselves of national forts, arsenals,\r\nand munitions of war, before the conflict began.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT TOO SLOW--WHY? SLAVERY.\r\n\r\nBut either way the war has not gone too slowly with reference to its\r\ngreat end--the establishment of a durable peace. If the rebellion had\r\nbeen crushed at once by overwhelming force, it would have been crushed\r\nonly to break out anew. Slavery would have been left unimpaired, and\r\nthat would inevitably have entailed another conflict in no long time. In\r\nthe interest of slavery the rebels have drawn the sword; let slavery\r\nperish by the sword. In the interest of slavery they have attempted to\r\noverthrow the National Government and to dismember the national domain;\r\nlet slavery be overthrown to maintain the Government and to preserve the\r\nintegrity of the nation. Let the cause of the war perish with the war.\r\nNot until slavery is extinguished can there be a lasting peace; for not\r\nuntil then can the conditions of true national unity begin to exist.\r\nWhat wise and good man would wish to save it from extinction? It is as\r\nincompatible with the highest prosperity of the South as it is with a\r\ntrue national union between the South and the North. Once extinguished,\r\nthere will be a thousand-fold increase in every element of Southern\r\nwelfare, economical, social, and moral; and possibilities of national\r\nwealth and strength, greatness and glory, above every nation on the\r\nglobe, will be established. Let slavery go down. Let us rejoice that in\r\nthe progress and sequel of this war, it must and will go down.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nLooking back, we can now see that much that was trying to the patience\r\nof the loyal masses of the North in the early stages of the war, has\r\nonly served to make it more certain that what ought to be will be. Time\r\nhas done justice to the idiotic policy of fighting the rebellion with\r\none hand and with the other upholding the institution that constituted\r\nat once its motive and its strength. Time has brought policy and justice\r\nto shake hands together at the right moment on the same road, and made\r\nthat respectable and acceptable as a military necessity which was once\r\nrepudiated as a fanaticism. Time has brought out the President's\r\nEmancipation Proclamation, and established it on a firm basis in the\r\njudgment and consent of all wise and true loyal men, North and South--to\r\nthe great discomfiture of sundry politicians--the utterances of some of\r\nwhom not long ago can be no otherwise taken than as the revelation and\r\ndespairing death wail of disconcerted schemes. Strange that men whose\r\nwhole lives have been passed in forecasting public opinion for their\r\npolitical uses, should have rushed upon the thick bosses of the great\r\nshield of the public will, which begirts the President and his\r\nEmancipation Proclamation;--for certainly all the railing at\r\n_radicalism_, which we heard in certain quarters last summer, was in\r\nfact nothing but the expression of disappointment and chagrin at the\r\nemancipation policy of the President, and that too at a time when that\r\npolicy had come to be accepted by the great body of the loyal people of\r\nthe nation (including all the eminent Southern loyalists), as not only\r\nindispensable to the national salvation, but desirable in every view.\r\nStrange that at such a time, and among those once active and influential\r\nin the formation of the Republican party--a party born of the roused\r\nspirit of resistance to slavery aggressions--there should have been\r\nfound a single person unable to discern and to accept the inevitable\r\nlogic of events which was to make the extinction of slavery the only\r\nwise, practicable, and truly loyal stand point. Strange that any\r\nRepublican should be disposed to put a stop to the 'irrepressible\r\nconflict.' It was too late in the day to attempt the organization of a\r\ngreat, victorious Conservative party by splitting up the old\r\norganizations. The old organizations may fall to pieces. It is best,\r\nperhaps, they should--but not to form a Conservative party. Conservatism\r\nis not now to the popular taste. It means nothing but the saving of\r\nslavery, and the great body of the loyal people now feel absolved from\r\nall obligation to save it; they do not care to have it saved; and the\r\nvaticinations of those prophets of evil who predicted disaster and ruin\r\nto the national cause from the emancipation policy of the Government\r\nexcite no consternation in the loyal heart of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn a review of the conduct of the war, how little reason appears for\r\nregret and how much for satisfaction in regard to all the great measures\r\nof the Government!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCIAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe successful working of the _financial system_ has demonstrated the\r\nwisdom of its principles. Instead of following the old wretched way of\r\nthrowing an immense amount of stocks into market at a sacrifice of\r\nfifteen to thirty per cent., the Government has got all the money it\r\nwanted at half or a little more than half the usual rate of interest. It\r\nwould have been better if the currency had been made to consist wholly\r\nof United States legal-tender notes, fundable in six per cent.,\r\nbonds--with a proper provision for the interest and for a sinking fund.\r\n\r\nBut the financial system adopted is a matter of satisfaction, apart from\r\nits admirable success in furnishing the Government with the means to\r\ncarry on the war: it is the inauguration of sounder principles on\r\ncurrency than have heretofore prevailed, which, if unfolded and carried\r\nlegitimately out, will give the country the best currency in the\r\nworld--perfectly secured, uniform in value at every point, and liable to\r\nno disastrous expansions and contractions. The notion that any great\r\nindustrial, manufacturing, and commercial nation can conduct its\r\nbusiness--any more than it can carry on a great war--with a specie\r\ncurrency alone, is indeed exploded; but the notion that a paper currency\r\nto be safe must be based on specie, still prevails--although the\r\ncurrency furnished by the thousands of banks scattered throughout the\r\ncountry has never been really based upon the actual possession of specie\r\nto the extent of more than _one fifth_ of the amount in circulation. It\r\nmay be the doctrine will never come to prevail that a specie basis in\r\nwhole or in part is no more indispensable to a sound and safe paper\r\ncurrency than an exclusive specie currency is possible or desirable in a\r\ncountry like this. It may be that the people will never come to believe\r\nthat a legal-tender paper currency, issued exclusively by the National\r\nGovernment--based upon the credit of the nation, constituting a lien\r\nupon all the property of the country, and proportioned in amount of\r\nissue to the needs of the people for it as an instrument of\r\nexchange--would, for all home uses, possess in full perfection the\r\nnature, functions, and powers of money. It is a subject we do not\r\npropose to discuss. It is enough now to say that the notes of the United\r\nStates, fundable in national six per cent. bonds, and drawing interest\r\nas they do semi-annually in gold, must be admitted by everybody to be as\r\nsafe a currency as the banks as a whole have ever supplied, and to\r\npossess other advantages which make them incomparably a better currency\r\nthan that of local banks.\r\n\r\nThe high price to which gold has been carried by gambling speculators,\r\nis not to be taken as indicating a proportionate want of confidence in\r\nthe success of the national cause and in the intrinsic value of the\r\nnational securities. It indicates nothing of the sort--at any rate,\r\nwhatever it may be taken to indicate, it is none the less true that\r\nUnited States six per cent. bonds were from the first eagerly sought for\r\nand taken as investments at the rate of a million a day--faster indeed\r\nthan the Government could at first supply them; with a constantly\r\naugmenting demand, until in the last week of October _thirty-six_\r\nmillions were disposed of--leaving only one hundred and fifty millions\r\nunsold, which will doubtless all be taken before this paper is\r\npublished. Comment on this is entirely needless.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of our _foreign relations_, certain official declarations\r\nin the early part of the war on the policy and purpose of Government in\r\ncarrying it on, are to be regretted as gratuitous and unfortunate. It is\r\nto be regretted also that the capture of the _Trent_ and the seizure of\r\nMason and Slidell was not at once disavowed as being contrary to our\r\ndoctrine on neutral rights, and the rebel emissaries surrendered without\r\nwaiting for reclamation on the part of the British Government; or, if it\r\nwas thought best to await that reclamation as containing a virtual\r\nconcession of our doctrine, it would have been better--more dignified\r\nand effective--if the reply had been limited to a simple statement that\r\nthe surrender was necessitated by the principles always maintained by\r\nour Government, and not by a reclamation which the British Government,\r\nby its own construction of public law and by its own practice, was not\r\nentitled to make, but which being made, might now, it was to be hoped,\r\nbe taken as an abandonment in the future of the ground heretofore\r\nmaintained by that Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCESSION OF BELLIGERENT RIGHTS TO THE REBELS.\r\n\r\nThere has been some dissatisfaction with the conduct of our official\r\ncommunications with Great Britain and France respecting the question on\r\nbelligerent rights and neutral obligations which the rebellion has\r\nraised. But there are points of no inconsiderable difficulty and\r\ndelicacy involved in these questions, which a great many people, in\r\ntheir natural displeasure against the English and French, have failed to\r\nconsider. Our Government deserves the credit of having consulted the\r\ninterests without compromising the dignity of the nation. Admitting the\r\nconduct of the British and French Governments in recognizing the rebels\r\nas belligerents to be as unfriendly and as unrequired by the obligations\r\nof public law as it is generally held to be among us, that would not\r\nmake it right or wise for our Government to depart from the tone of\r\nmoderation. We can no more make it a matter for official complaint and\r\ndemand against these Governments, than we could the unfriendly tone of\r\nmany of their newspapers and Parliamentary orators. We might say to\r\nthem: We take it as unkindly in you to do as you have done; but if they\r\nwill continue to do so, we have nothing for it but to submit. Even if we\r\ncould have afforded it, we could not rightly have gone to war with them\r\nfor doing what we ourselves--through the necessity of our\r\ncircumstances--have been compelled in effect to do, and what they,\r\nthough not forced by any such necessity, had yet a right--and in their\r\nown opinion were obliged--by public law to do. We could not have made it\r\na cause of war, and therefore it would have been worse than idle to\r\nindulge in a style of official representation which means war if it\r\nmeans anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REBEL CRUISERS.\r\n\r\nThe question of the rebel cruisers on the high seas is a question by\r\nitself. The anger excited among us by the injuries we have suffered from\r\nthese vessels is not strange; nor is it strange that our anger should\r\nbeget a disposition to quarrel with Great Britain and France for\r\nconceding the rights of lawful belligerents to the perpetrators of such\r\natrocities. The rebels have no courts of admiralty, carry their prizes\r\nto no ports, submit them to no lawful adjudication--but capture,\r\nplunder, and burn private vessels in mid ocean. Such proceedings by the\r\nlaws of nations are undoubtedly piratical in their nature. We have a\r\nright so to hold and declare. We may think that Great Britain and France\r\nare bound so to hold and declare. But what then? Should they have\r\nordered their men of war to cruise against these rebel cruisers or to\r\ncapture every one which they might chance to encounter, and to send them\r\nhome for trial? We may think they were bound in vindication of public\r\nlaw to do so; but could we make their not doing so a matter of formal\r\ncomplaint and a cause of war? There are a number of things to be well\r\nconsidered before any one should permit himself to quarrel with our\r\nGovernment for not quarrelling with Great Britain and France on this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH VIOLATION OF NEUTRAL OBLIGATIONS.\r\n\r\nBut the conduct of the British Government in allowing her ports to be\r\nmade the basis of these nefarious operations--in permitting vessels of\r\nwhose character and purpose there could be no doubt to be built in her\r\nports--not to be delivered in any Confederate port, but in effect armed\r\nand manned from her ports to go immediately to cruise against our\r\ncommerce on the high seas--is an outrageous violation of the obligations\r\nof neutrals, for which that Government may justly be held responsible.\r\nIt is a responsibility which no technical pleading about the\r\ninsufficiency of British laws, either in matter of prohibition or rules\r\nof evidence, can avoid. Great Britain is bound to have laws and rules of\r\nevidence which will enable her effectually to discharge her neutral\r\nobligations; whether she has or not, does not alter her responsibility\r\nto us. Her conduct may rightfully be made a matter of official\r\ncomplaint, and of war too--if satisfaction and reparation be refused. It\r\nis a case in which our rights and dignity are concerned; and it is to be\r\npresumed that our Government will not fail to vindicate them.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION--THE CONFISCATION LAW.\r\n\r\nThe action of _Congress_ has in everything been nobly patriotic in\r\nspirit, and in nearly everything it has wisely and adequately met the\r\nexigencies of the crisis.\r\n\r\nBut we are compelled to hold the Confiscation Act, in the form in which\r\nit was passed, as a mistake.[2] If the clause of the Constitution\r\nprohibiting 'attainder of treason to work forfeiture except during the\r\nlife of the person attainted,' be necessarily applicable to the\r\nConfiscation Act, it seems to us impossible to avoid the conclusion that\r\nthe act is unconstitutional. So far as the language of the prohibition\r\nis decisive of anything, it must be taken to include all sorts of\r\nproperty, real as well as personal--the term _forfeiture_ certainly\r\nhaving that extent of application in the old English law and practice,\r\nfrom which the framers of our Constitution took it, and there is nothing\r\nelsewhere in the Constitution or in its history to warrant any other\r\nconstruction. So the Congress of 1790 understood it in the act\r\ndeclaring the punishment of treason and some other high crimes. As to\r\nthe _perpetuity_ of forfeiture, it seems equally necessary to hold that\r\nit is prohibited by the clause of the Constitution in question. Such is\r\nundeniably the first and obvious meaning of the terms. It has been\r\nargued indeed that it was not the intention of the framers of the\r\nConstitution to prohibit perpetual forfeiture of property from being\r\n'declared' by Congress, but only to prohibit 'attainder of treason' from\r\n'working' of itself that effect by necessary consequence--as it did\r\nunder the Common Law of England. It has also been argued that the\r\nconstitutional restriction does not relate to perpetuity of forfeiture,\r\nbut only requires that the forfeiture or act of alienation take place,\r\nhave effect, and be accomplished 'during the life of the person\r\nattainted,' and not after his death.\r\n\r\nBut this reasoning is more subtile than satisfactory. A fair\r\nconsideration of the subject leaves little room for doubt that the\r\nframers of the Constitution had in view and intended to prohibit\r\neverything which under the old English common law followed upon\r\n'attainder of treason'--to prohibit forfeiture in perpetuity of property\r\nof every sort, no less than 'bills of attainder,' 'corruption of blood,'\r\nand barbarities of punishment, such as disembowelling, quartering, etc.\r\n\r\nIf therefore the constitutional restriction on forfeiture apply to the\r\nConfiscation Law, it makes the law unconstitutional, in so far as it\r\nenacts the _perpetual_ forfeiture of the personal estate of rebels; and\r\nthe discrimination made in regard to their real estate does not save the\r\nconstitutionality of the act.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the Confiscation Law is to be held as constitutional, it\r\ncan be so, as it seems to us, only on the ground that it does not fall\r\nwithin the scope of the constitutional prohibition in question. This\r\nground may be maintained by asserting that the constitutional\r\nprohibition of perpetual forfeiture applies only to cases of 'attainder\r\nof treason,' that is, according to Blackstone, of 'judgment of death for\r\ntreason,' and that cases under this act are not such; that the\r\nlimitations applicable to ordinary judicial proceedings against traitors\r\nare not applicable here; that the Confiscation Act seizes the property\r\nof rebels not in their quality of criminals, but of public enemies; that\r\nit is not an act for the punishment of treason, but for weakening and\r\nsubduing an armed rebellion, and securing indemnification for the costs\r\nand damages it has entailed--in short, not a penal statute, but a war\r\nmeasure; and that the Constitution which gives Congress the right to\r\nmake war for the suppression of the rebellion, and to subject the lives\r\nof rebels to the laws of war, gives it the right to subject their\r\nproperty also to the same laws--putting both out of the protection of\r\nthe ordinary laws; and finally that all the objects aimed at by the\r\nmeasure are legitimated by the principles of public law.\r\n\r\nIf these views can be sustained, it follows that Congress was justified\r\nnot only in enacting the perpetual confiscation of the _personal_\r\nproperty of rebels, but need not, and should not, have passed the\r\nexplanatory clause prohibiting 'forfeiture of _real_ estate beyond the\r\nnatural life' of the rebel. So far as weakening the rebellion,\r\nindemnifying the nation for costs and damages, or the rights and\r\ninterests of the heirs of rebels, are concerned, there is no reason in\r\njustice or in policy for the discrimination made between personal and\r\nreal estate; if it is right and wise to take the one in perpetuity, it\r\nis equally so to take the other. In our judgment, it is right and wise\r\nto do both.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY ADMINISTRATION--NO ARMY OF RESERVE.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the war, we can all now see a very great error in the\r\n_military_ administration--the neglect, namely, to provide and keep up\r\na proper reserved force. It is the grand mistake of the war. Two years\r\nand a half of war, and no army of reserve! Eighteen months ago, a force\r\nof reserve of at least two hundred thousand men should have been formed.\r\nIt could probably then have been formed of volunteers. From it,\r\nvacancies made in the armies in the field by battle, disease, or\r\nexpiration of time of service, could have been filled with drilled and\r\ndisciplined soldiers, and reinforcements drawn to meet any special\r\nexigency. The victory of Gettysburgh might have resulted in the total\r\ndestruction of Lee's army before he could recross the Potomac; and\r\nRosecrans might have been strengthened without weakening the Army of the\r\nPotomac or any other. Whether the cost of forming and keeping up such a\r\nforce of reserve would have greatly exceeded the cost of the recent\r\ndraft, we do not pretend to know. We are inclined to think it would not.\r\nBut that is a question of little moment. Money wisely spent is well\r\nspent: money unwisely saved is ill saved. With such a force, the recent\r\ndraft might not have been necessary--at all events there would have been\r\nno necessity for suspending active military operations in Virginia, and\r\nawaiting the slow completion of the draft, at a moment when, large\r\nadditions to the forces in the field were precisely the one thing\r\nneedful. The army of reserve would at once have supplied disciplined\r\nsoldiers, and their places in the camps of instruction and reserve could\r\nhave been filled with the new conscripts as fast as they were collected.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSOLATION--ENFORCEMENT OF THE DRAFT IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nBut grave as the error is which we have signalized, there is something\r\nthat might well console us for greater misfortunes than it has entailed,\r\nand which gives us another illustration of the truth that God and Time\r\noften work for us better than we for ourselves, and out of our errors\r\nbring good that we could not forecast.\r\n\r\nIt would not be wise to assert that the not having such a reserved force\r\nnecessitated the recent draft, and thereby occasioned the horrible\r\noutbreak in New York. But if it may even be safely suggested as possibly\r\ntrue, the successful enforcement of the draft becomes all the more a\r\nmatter for boundless joy and congratulation. Important as its\r\nenforcement throughout the country was as a means of filling up the\r\nranks of our armies, the outbreak in New York made it a thousand times\r\nmore important as the only adequate assertion of the supremacy of\r\nnational law.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt as to the nature, origin, and purpose of that\r\noutbreak. It was the result of a long-prepared traitorous conspiracy in\r\nthe interest of the rebels. The enforcement of the draft against mob\r\nviolence instigated by treason, was indispensable not only to the\r\nsuccessful prosecution of the war against the rebels of the South, but\r\nto the maintenance of the supreme authority and power of the National\r\nGovernment, and of the foundations of social order at the North. Not to\r\nhave enforced it might have insured the triumph of the rebellion and the\r\nindependence of the South; it certainly would have rendered the North no\r\nlonger a country fit for any decent man to live in. Such and so great\r\nwas the significance of the crisis. The responsibility of the\r\nAdministration was immense. The President met it nobly. He took care\r\nthat a sufficient military force--not under the control of Governor\r\nSeymour, but of a well-tried patriot--was present in New York. He\r\ncarried out the draft there and everywhere else. He crushed the schemes\r\nand hopes of the traitorous conspirators--more guilty than the rebels in\r\narms-and gave a demonstration of the _strength of the National\r\nGovernment_, as grand in its majesty as it was indispensable to the\r\nnational salvation in this crisis and to its security in all future\r\ntime. The Government has triumphed in the quiet majesty of its\r\nirresistible force over factious and traitorous opposition at the North,\r\nspringing from treasonable sympathy with the rebels, or, from what, in a\r\ncrisis like this, is equally wicked, the selfishness of party spirit,\r\npreferring party to country. More than this, it has triumphed over the\r\ndangerous and destructive notions on State sovereignty, which traitors\r\nand partisans have dared invoke. It is impossible to overestimate the\r\nimportance for the present and for the future of this victorious\r\nassertion of the _supremacy of the National Government_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY REVIEW.\r\n\r\nIn a review, then, of this gigantic struggle, we have every reason to be\r\ncontent and confident--no reason to bate one jot of heart or hope. The\r\ntriumph over Northern treason, achieved by the force of the Government,\r\nhas been followed by a moral triumph at the polls, no less grand in its\r\nsignificance. The country is not oppressed by the stupendous expenses of\r\nthe war. The money is all spent at home. It stimulates the productive\r\nindustry of the country, and the nation is all the time growing rich.\r\nThe rebels have been disastrously repulsed in two attempts at invasion,\r\nand do not hold one inch of Northern soil. One third of the States\r\nclaimed by them at the outset, are gone from them forever: Maryland,\r\nMissouri, Kentucky, are securely in the Union; Virginia we have cut in\r\ntwo--nearly one half of its territory, by the will of its inhabitants,\r\nnow constituting a loyal member of the Union as the new State of West\r\nVirginia--while of its eastern half we securely hold its coast, harbors,\r\nand fortresses, and a considerable number of its counties. Tennessee is\r\nours, and cannot, we think, be wrenched away. We have New Orleans, and\r\nthe uncontrolled possession of the Mississippi river--cutting the\r\nterritory of the rebels in two, destroying their communications, and\r\ngiving us a considerable portion of the States bordering that river. In\r\nNorth Carolina and South Carolina we have a hold, from which it will be\r\nhard to drive us. On the Atlantic and Gulf coast nearly every fortress\r\nis in our possession; there is not a port which is not possessed by us,\r\nor else so blockaded that (except in the peculiar case of Wilmington) it\r\nis a hazardous affair for any vessel to attempt going in or coming out;\r\nand the rebels are utterly unable to raise the blockade of a single\r\nport. In fine, they have lost more than one third of their territory\r\nforever, and of the remaining portion there is not one considerable\r\nsubdivision over which in some part the flag of the Union does not\r\nsecurely wave. What title to recognition as an independent power can the\r\nConfederate rebels present to the neutral powers of the world?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF AMERICAN LIFE AND SCENERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile American tourists are delightedly visiting and minutely describing\r\nthe most hidden recesses of beauty among the mountains, plains, seas,\r\nlakes, and rivers of Europe, there are, close within their reach,\r\ninnumerable spots well worthy of consideration, and hitherto entirely\r\nunknown to the great mass of pleasure and scenery seeking travellers.\r\nThese fair but hidden gems have become of the more importance that the\r\ngrand struggle convulsing our country has rendered foreign travel\r\ndifficult, even when advisable, and has roused within our people a love\r\nfor their own land, a pride in its loveliness, much more rarely felt\r\nbefore the attempt to dismember and ruin it had awakened dormant\r\npatriotism and completed the severance between the recent _province_ and\r\nthe historically renowned mother country. American painters are worthily\r\nillustrating American life and landscape; American poets, and no less\r\npoetical prose writers, are singing the forests, skies, flowers, and\r\nbirds of their native land; and the inquisitive traveller should surely\r\nnot fail to add his humbler mite in the way of discovery and\r\ndescription. The following sketches are founded upon actual observation,\r\nand the delineations of scenery and manners therein contained are\r\nstrictly in accordance with the personal experience of the author.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--A SUMMER EXCURSION.\r\n\r\n'All very well,' said Aunt Sarah; 'I have no doubt the excursion would\r\nbe charming; but who will accompany you?'\r\n\r\n'We do not require an escort; we can take care of each other,'\r\n\r\n'Can it be that you, Lucy, a staid married woman of thirty-six, and you,\r\nElsie, a demure young girl of twenty, are suddenly about to enter the\r\nranks of the strong minded?'\r\n\r\n'Why, dear aunt,' said Lucy D----, 'you would not have us weak minded,\r\nwould you? I think I heard you say no longer ago than yesterday that\r\nhalf the domestic miseries in this world were due to the weak nerves and\r\nfeeble intellects of poorly educated women.'\r\n\r\n'True; but the technical expression, 'strong minded,' does not mean\r\nstrong in mind--rather the contrary.'\r\n\r\n'In other words, strong minded means weak minded, is that it, auntie?'\r\nlaughed Elsie.\r\n\r\n'I see, Aunt Sarah,' said Lucy, 'we shall be forced to call upon you for\r\nthat most difficult of tasks, a definition. What is meant by the term,\r\n'strong-minded woman'?'\r\n\r\n'A monster,' replied Mrs. Sarah Grundy, 'who lectures, speaks in public,\r\nwants women to vote, to wear men's garments; in a word, one who would\r\nlike to upset religion, social life, and the world in general.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' dear auntie, 'we surely do not purpose committing any of these\r\nenormities; our intentions simply embrace a short excursion of some\r\nforty miles in search of fine scenery, health, and a little amusement.\r\nWe have no confidence in our power to influence the public, even if we\r\nthought we had aught to say which they do not already know; we do not\r\nsee that voting has a very beneficial effect upon men, witness election\r\ndays; as for their garments, they are too hideously ungraceful for us to\r\ncovet; in faith, we are of the most orthodox; we confess, we do think\r\nsocial life needs sundry reforms, more charity and forbearance, less\r\ndetraction and ostentation, etc., etc.; and as for the world in general,\r\nwe think it very beautiful, and only wish to overlook some few\r\nadditional miles of its lovely mountains, lakes, and streams.'\r\n\r\n'Well, well, girls, young people always can talk faster than old ones;\r\nbut do you really think it safe for you to venture without escort? You\r\ndo not even know the name of the place which you wish to visit; you have\r\nbeen informed that on the summit of yonder mountain is a lake, said to\r\nbe picturesque; but of its cognomen, and of the proper means to reach\r\nit, you are utterly ignorant. You will have to ask questions of all\r\nsorts of people.'\r\n\r\n'Suppose we do--being women, we will certainly in America receive civil\r\nanswers.'\r\n\r\n'But if some person unknown to you should speak to you?'\r\n\r\n'Little danger, dear aunt, of dread unknowns, if we comport ourselves\r\nproperly; I have travelled much in all kinds of public conveyances, and\r\nnever yet have been improperly addressed. Did you ever have an adventure\r\nof the sort'?\r\n\r\n'Once only,' replied Aunt Sarah, 'and then the fault was my own. I was\r\nyoung and giddy; Cousin Nancy was with me, and we were in a rail-car. In\r\na near seat sat a very good-looking young man; Nancy looked toward him\r\nonce or twice and, meeting his eye, began to giggle: I foolishly joined\r\nher; thus encouraged, our young gentleman opened a conversation. Nancy\r\nlaughed immoderately; but I, being a few years older, soon controlled my\r\nsilly giggling; and by the tone of my reply speedily silenced our\r\nwould-be admirer. He turned his back upon us, and, so far as I know, in\r\nless than five minutes had forgotten our very existence.'\r\n\r\n'Decidedly a case in our favor! And if the boat should blow up, or the\r\ncar roll down an embankment, in what would we be benefited by the fact\r\nof having an escort also to be scalded or have his head broken?'\r\n\r\n'Ye maun even then gang your ain gait. I wish you a pleasant journey and\r\na safe return.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, auntie, and you will not call us strong minded?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly not, unless I find you merit the appellation.'\r\n\r\nThe little trunk was soon packed, and one fine July morning the two\r\ntravellers set off in search of the beautiful lake, whose name is not to\r\nbe found in the guide books. They knew it was to be looked for in a\r\nsharp and peculiar dent in the Shawangunk mountain, which dent, so far\r\nas they could judge from the hills near their dwelling on the northern\r\nslope of the Highlands, must be nearly opposite Poughkeepsie. Neither\r\nmap nor gazetteer could they procure; the neighbors could give them no\r\ninformation, and they were forced to proceed with only the\r\nabove-mentioned meagre stock of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe first stage was of five miles, in a carriage to Newburg, where they\r\ntook the day boat for Albany. Our novices felt more or less anxiety\r\nregarding the fidelity of the porter intrusted with their two small\r\narticles of baggage; but said articles appearing somewhat late, though\r\nstill in season, and being duly marked for Poughkeepsie, the first\r\nquestion asked was as to the existence of such a place as New Paltz\r\nLanding, opposite the above-named city, and the facilities for crossing\r\nthe river. None of those in authority knew certainly of a ferry, but\r\nsupposed it highly probable. The wharf at Poughkeepsie was suggested as\r\na proper place to obtain information; and, once there, our travellers\r\nsoon found themselves in the hands of an intelligent contraband, who\r\npromised to place them safely on the desired ferry boat. As they neared\r\nthe dock, a great rock, with an upset wagon for foreground, furnished an\r\nencouraging picture for two lone lady tourists. The boat proved neat and\r\ncomfortable, and here again inquiries were made. The very polite captain\r\nhad heard of a lake on the Shawangunk mountain, but knew neither its\r\nname nor exact location. He advised them to have their baggage sent to\r\nthe little inn at the landing, where they might dine and await a stage\r\nexpected to pass in about an hour on its way to New Paltz, a village\r\nnine miles west of the river. At the inn they fancied they must\r\ncertainly learn something definite regarding the final object of their\r\nundertaking. A large map of Ulster county hung in the sitting room, and\r\ngave promise of some decided information. Unfortunately, it was not of a\r\nrecent edition: a nameless lake on the Shawangunk mountain, about five\r\nmiles from New Paltz, seemed to be the object of their search; but the\r\nlandlord, who had heard of a lake in that direction, could not tell how\r\nit was to be reached, or whether shelter could there be found in any\r\ndecent tenement; his impression was that there had been a public house\r\non top of the mountain, but that it had recently been destroyed by fire.\r\nCertainties were evidently still unattainable.\r\n\r\nFinally, the stage arrived--a vehicle drawn by two horses, and intended\r\nto seat four persons. In it were already two ladies, with bags and\r\nbundles, two trunks, a champagne basket, numberless packages, and about\r\nfifty bottles of soda water, laid in among the straw covering the bottom\r\nof the accommodating conveyance. The driver, a good-natured, intelligent\r\nman, gave our travellers his bench, and arranged a seat for himself and\r\nthe champagne basket on a sort of shelf overhanging the tails of the\r\nhorses. At the top of the first hill is the village of Houstonville,\r\nwhere they stopped at the post office to leave the mail, and where two\r\nladies appeared as claimants for seats in the stage. The driver at first\r\ndemurred; but, finding the ladies persistent, he drew forth a board,\r\nand, fastening it at either end to a perpendicular prop, constructed a\r\nthird bench, on which the two new passengers took their places.\r\n\r\nThe stage was by this time more than well packed; but ere long the\r\nprocess of lightening up commenced, as first the champagne basket, then\r\npackages, bundles, and newspapers, were left at various dwellings along\r\nthe roadside. One novelty especially striking was the wayside post\r\noffice, consisting of a box on a pole, intended to contain the daily\r\nnewspaper therein thrust to await the coming of the owners.\r\n\r\nOf course the driver was plied with numerous questions regarding the\r\nthus far nameless lake. He had been up the Shawangunk mountain fishing,\r\nbut that was years before; there was a lake, but he had never heard any\r\nname given to it; he had understood a house had been built since his\r\nlast visit; but he did not know if it was intended to accommodate\r\nvisitors during the night. Of one thing, however, he was quite certain,\r\nand that was, the impossibility of finding a horse in New Paltz to take\r\nthe ladies up that evening. The inns had none to let; there were no\r\nlivery stables, and his own pair were too greatly fatigued by their\r\ntwenty-mile drive to venture up so steep an ascent; but he thought a\r\nconveyance might be found for the following morning. The views along the\r\nroad were charming; and the sharp, jagged crest known as Paltz Point,\r\noverhung the well-cultivated rolling valley beneath, giving a fair\r\npromise of an extended and characteristic view.\r\n\r\nThe inn, to which the travellers were driven, proved very neat and\r\ncomfortable. It was a new edifice, with an accommodating landlord and\r\nlandlady, the latter of which personages seemed quite mystified by the\r\nadvent of two lorn ladies in search of an unknown lake. In the entry\r\nhung a new map of Ulster county, on which appeared a lake nestling under\r\nthe cliffs of Paltz Point, but still without a name. Paltz Point!--that\r\nmust be the very jagged pile of rock visible from the Cornwall hills,\r\nand the lake at its foot more than probably the object of the journey.\r\n\r\nThe landlord was quite positive as to the existence of a house, but\r\ndoubted its capacity in regard to sleeping accommodations; he also\r\ncorroborated the testimony of the driver respecting the difficulty of\r\nobtaining a vehicle, every horse being engaged haying. The ladies\r\nannounced that, as the distance was only six miles, it could be walked,\r\nin case this difficulty proved insuperable. An individual at the tea\r\ntable proposed that the travellers should be taken up some time in the\r\nmiddle of the night, that the horse might return by six o'clock in the\r\nmorning; but this suggestion was unanimously frowned down. The chief\r\nreason for requiring a horse and wagon lay in the little trunk, which,\r\nas it contained the painting box of our Elsie, who thought the lake and\r\nvicinity might offer some picturesque studies, could not possibly be\r\nleft behind. After tea, a walk was taken, and the vicinage of New Paltz\r\nduly inspected. The Wallkill, here a quiet stream, runs through rich,\r\ngreen meadows, bordered by the noble range of the Catskills and the\r\nsingular, broken ridges of the Shawangunk. The sun set clear, casting\r\npale gold streams of light over the meadows, and leaving a long,\r\nlingering, rosy twilight. The young art-student drank in beauty with\r\nevery breath. The cows were driven home; the ducks came slowly up out of\r\nthe stream, and all the winged creatures went to roost. Night came, and\r\nrepose was welcome after the pleasures and fatigues of the day's\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nAt eight the following morning, a steady black pony, with a light open\r\nwagon, appeared at the door; and by ten o'clock the travellers reached\r\nthe mountain top. Their steed showed marvellous endurance in the way of\r\nslow pacing down steep hills, which they afterward found had been\r\nacquired in leading sad trains of mourners to the modest graveyards,\r\nwherein rest the earthly remains of the peaceful dwellers in this\r\npastoral vale. The first four or five miles of road were excellent, but\r\nthe last one or two so rough and stony, that they were quite willing to\r\nwalk. On top of the mountain stands a little inn, commanding a\r\nmagnificent view in several directions. As they neared the end of their\r\njourney, they rejoiced to see a white house gleaming through the trees,\r\nand promising food and shelter. The sound of coming wheels brought out\r\nthe land-lady, who gave the travellers a hearty welcome, and assured\r\nthem of her ability to harbor them for the night. The end was\r\naccomplished--the goal reached! And what a goal! Nowhere among all the\r\nbeautiful scenery in the Middle and Eastern States is there a spot more\r\ncharacteristic and interesting than Paltz Point, and the lake that lies\r\nunder its shadow--that lake, whose name was a mystery, even to the\r\ninmates of the house built upon its brink. Its waters are clear, and of\r\na deep green hue; its depth is said to be great, and its rocky shores\r\nrise in perpendicular cliffs of from ten to two hundred feet. The\r\nhighest point stands three or four hundred feet above the surface of the\r\nwater; but in that part the cliffs are no longer perpendicular. The\r\nlength of the lake is about a mile, and the width perhaps half that\r\ndistance. The rocks are gray sandstone or quartz conglomerate, making\r\nthe cliffsides, except where covered by black lichens, of a glittering\r\nwhite. On one side, the rocks rise in steep, precipitous masses, while\r\non the other they are shattered into every imaginable form. The clefts\r\nare deep and narrow, great hemlocks rise from the bottoms of the\r\nfissures, and the vast masses of fallen or split rock lie piled and\r\ncloven, confusedly tossed about, gigantic memorials of the great\r\nconvulsion that in days long gone by heaped up the long ridge of the\r\nShawangunk, and shattered its northern dip into such majestic and\r\nfantastic cliffs. The deepest and wildest chasm is filled by the weird,\r\ngreen lake. Straying along the tops of the precipices bordering the\r\nwater, our travellers beheld lovely vistas of the far-away country,\r\nnorth, south, east, or west, stealing in through rocky or leafy\r\nopenings. An easy ascent of about half a mile leads to the summit of the\r\nPoint. Blueberries were ripe, and beguiled the pair into many a moment's\r\ndallying by the wayside. Not until they reached the very top were they\r\nquite sure they had after all found the place they came to seek; but one\r\nview down the jagged line of the Shawangunk, convinced our Elsie that no\r\nother spot could have furnished the sketch seen in the studio, where she\r\nhad been advised to seek 'the lake on the Shawangunk mountain.'\r\n\r\nThe view from Paltz Point is magical. The long line of the Catskills\r\nsweeps boldly across the near northern horizon. Nowhere do those\r\nmountains seem so majestic, or their forms so broken and beautiful;\r\nnearer are the Olive mountains, beyond which flows the Esopus. Rondout\r\ncreek, the Wallkill, and the Hudson, water the fertile vales lying among\r\nthe hills. To the south stretches the line of the Shawangunk toward the\r\nDelaware river, and on the extreme southern and southeastern horizon\r\nrise the Highlands, with the river gap, the rifted sides of the Storm\r\nKing, the Beacons, the great broad shoulders of Schunemunk;--even the\r\nwhite buildings on the plain at West Point may be seen glittering in the\r\nafternoon sun. A clear atmosphere is needed for the full enjoyment of\r\nthe view, as the panorama is so vast that even a slight haze obscures\r\nmany of the more interesting distant objects. And what words could\r\ndescribe the jutting headlands--wild, broken lines of white cliffs\r\nstretching to the southward, deep chasms, steep, forest-clad mountains,\r\ngreen or blue as distance, sunshine, or shadow may decree, and the\r\ntranquil green lake, smiling as a deep, strong and cheerful spirit amid\r\nthe ruins of a shattered, wasted life? As our travellers gazed, they\r\nthanked God that His world was so beautiful, and wondered if even Aunt\r\nSarah would not be willing to run the risk of being thought strong\r\nminded to see so fair a corner of it.\r\n\r\nThe moon that night rose late; and the air was chill as the sisters\r\nstood on a rock waiting until its rays should silver the placid waves.\r\nOverhead ran a strange, broad, coruscating band of magnetic light,\r\nmeteors flashed down the sky, a solitary loon sent a wild, despairing\r\ncry athwart the lake, and for the first time did our travellers feel\r\nthey were alone, eighteen hundred feet above the Hudson, far away from\r\nother human habitation. A truly feminine shudder ran through their\r\nhearts, as they turned toward the house and betook them to the cells\r\nappropriated to their use. The following day they were driven down the\r\nmountain by the owner (not the keeper) of the little inn beside the\r\nlake. He was one of nature's own gentlemen; tall,--six feet,\r\nperhaps,--gray haired, blue eyed, with every feature well cut, and with\r\nthe most honest expression ever beaming through a human countenance. The\r\nhearts of the sisters warmed toward him, and never were they more\r\nwilling to acknowledge the solidarity of the race, the great fact of the\r\nbrotherhood of all humanity.\r\n\r\nCornwall once again safely reached, and the outlines of the journey duly\r\nsketched, Aunt Sarah's first question was: 'Well, and what _is_ the name\r\nof this famous lake?'\r\n\r\nThe travellers were forced to confess the ill success of their efforts\r\nin discovering the proper appellation of that exquisite gem, and it was\r\nnot until many months later that, when visiting an exhibition of\r\npaintings, they found their new friend accurately portrayed under the\r\nname of--Mogunk Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASON, RHYME, AND RHYTHM.\r\n\r\n  'All arts are one, howe'er distributed they stand,\r\n   Verse, tone, shape, color, form, are fingers on one hand.'\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO VOLUME SECOND.\r\n\r\nOur first volume having been devoted to the Reason or Theory of Art in\r\ngeneral, it is our intention in the second, Rhyme and Rhythm, to bring\r\nthese comprehensive thoughts to a focus, and concentrate their light\r\nupon the art of Versification. Indeed, this volume is to be considered\r\nas a _manual_ of poetic Rhythm. Practical rules are given for its\r\nconstruction and criticism; simple solutions offered of its apparent\r\nirregularities and anomalies; and examples of sufficient length are\r\nquoted from the best poets to afford just ideas of the scope and power\r\nof the measure under consideration. The numerous citations given under\r\ntheir appropriate metrical heads are intended not only to assist the\r\nstudent in the analysis of verse, but to aid him in the choice of forms\r\nin accordance with his subject, in case he should himself wish to create\r\nPoems.\r\n\r\nBy its extrication from the entanglement of quantity and syllabic\r\naccent, under which it has been almost buried, an effort has been made\r\nto simplify the study of Rhythm: by tracing its origin and\r\ncharacteristics, and by the citation of poems in which its power and\r\nbeauty are conspicuous, we have endeavored to render the subject one of\r\nvivid interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIRST.\r\n\r\nRHYTHM.\r\n\r\nWhat is Rhythm? The best definition of this perplexing word has been\r\ngiven by the grand old Bohemian composer Tomaschek:\r\n\r\n     'The _order_ perceptible in a succession of sounds recurring in\r\n     _determinate_ portions of Time, which portions of Time are more\r\n     distinctly marked for the ear through the _accentuation_ of certain\r\n     determinate parts, constitutes Rhythm.\r\n\r\nRhythm has been surrounded with so much mystery, has been the subject of\r\nso much learned debate and research, has called forth so many quartos\r\nand folios, that few know what a familiar thing it is, how closely it\r\neverywhere surrounds us, how constantly it beats within us. For the\r\npulsations of the heart are rhythmical, and the measured throbs of life\r\nregister in music every moment of our passing existence on the bosom of\r\nTime. And when life manifests itself to the senses through the medium of\r\ntime, time being to the ear what space is to the eye, the Order of its\r\npulsations is Rhythm. Strange relation between our own marvellous being\r\nand the march of time, for its mystic rhythm beats in tune with every\r\nfeeling that sweeps over the heart, forever singing its primeval chant\r\nat the very core of our existence! The law of Rhythm is the law of\r\nmortal life: the constant recurrence of new effort sinking but to\r\nrecover itself in accurately proportioned rest, rising ever again in new\r\nexertion, to sink again in ever new repose:\r\n\r\n   'And our hearts, though true and brave,\r\n  Still, like muffled drums, are beating\r\n    Funeral marches to the grave.'\r\n\r\nThis low music of the heart never ceases until stilled by the touch of\r\ndeath, when the spirit, led by God, enters upon the waveless ocean of an\r\nimmeasurable eternity, where past and future meet in the eternal\r\npresent. Time with its rhythmic measures is then no more. The necessity\r\nof 'effort and rest,' 'exertion and repose,' will exist no longer. What\r\nthe fuller music of that higher life is to be, 'it has not yet entered\r\ninto the heart of man to conceive.' But if the very _imperfection_ of\r\nour being has been rendered so full of charm to us in the order and\r\nproportion with which it records its law, 'effort and repose,' 'life and\r\ndeath'--what may we not expect when this mortal shall have put on\r\nimmortality? We should think of this when that saddest of human sounds,\r\n'it beats no more; it measures time no longer'--knells upon our ear the\r\nsilence of the throbbing, passionate heart.\r\n\r\nNor is inanimate nature without the quickening breath of Rhythm. It\r\ncadences the dash of the wave, chimes in the flash of the oar, patters\r\nin the drops of rain, whispers in the murmurings of the forest leaves,\r\nleaps in the dash of the torrent, wails through the sighing of the\r\nrestless winds, and booms in the claps and crashes of heaven's thunders.\r\n\r\nOnly through _succession_ do we arrive at the idea of time, and through\r\na continual _being and ceasing to be_ are its steppings made sensible to\r\nus. It is thus literally true, as sung by the Poet, that 'we take no\r\nnote of Time but from its loss.' Happy are we if so used that it may\r\nmark our eternal progress.\r\n\r\nThere is but little mystery in the art of keeping time, since we may at\r\nonce gather a correct notion of it from the vibrations of the pulse, or\r\nfrom our manner of walking. If we listen to the sound of our own step,\r\nwe find it equal and regular, corresponding with what is termed common\r\ntime in music. Probably the time in which we walk is governed by the\r\naction of the heart, and those who step alike have pulses beating in the\r\nsame time. To walk faster than this gives the sensation of hurry; to\r\nwalk slower, that of loitering. The mere recurrence of sounds at regular\r\nintervals by no means constitutes the properties of _musical_ time;\r\naccent is necessary to parcel them out into those portions which Rhythm\r\nand the ear approve. If we listen to the trotting of a horse or the\r\ntread of our own feet, we cannot but notice that each alternate step is\r\nlouder than the other--by which we throw the sounds into the order of\r\ncommon time. But if we listen to the amble or canter of a horse, we hear\r\nevery third step to be louder than the other two, owing to the first and\r\nthird foot striking the ground together. This regularity throws the\r\nsounds, into the order of triple time. To one or other of these\r\ndescriptions may be referred every sort of time.\r\n\r\nThere is a sympathetic power in measured time which has not yet received\r\nthe attention it deserves. It has been found that in a watchmaker's shop\r\nthe timepieces or clocks connected with the same wall or shelf have such\r\na sympathetic effect in keeping time, that they stop those which beat in\r\nirregular time; and if any are at rest, set agoing those which beat\r\naccurately. What wonder then that the living, soldiers, artisans, such\r\nas smiths, paviors, etc., who work in unison with the pulse, should\r\nacquire habits of keeping time with the greatest correctness.\r\n\r\nRhythm not only measures the footfall of the pedestrian, but exerts a\r\nsympathetic power, so that if two are walking together, they feel its\r\nspell, and unconsciously fall into the same step, not aware that they\r\nare thus conforming to a Unity always engendered by the Order regulating\r\nrhythmical motion. It is this entrancing sense of unity which wings the\r\nfeet of the dancers, and enables them to endure with delight a degree of\r\nphysical exertion which, without it, would be utterly exhausting. The\r\nfollowing extract from the _Atlantic Monthly_, of July, 1858, is so much\r\nto our purpose, that we place it before the reader:\r\n\r\n     'The sailor does not lack for singing. He sings at certain parts of\r\n     his work;--indeed, he must sing, if he would work. On vessels of\r\n     war, the drum and fife or boatswain's whistle furnish the necessary\r\n     movement-regulator. There, where the strength of one or two hundred\r\n     men can be applied to one and the same effort, the labor is not\r\n     intermittent, but continuous. The men form on either side of the\r\n     rope to be hauled, and walk away with it like firemen marching with\r\n     their engine. When the headmost pair bring up at the stern or bow,\r\n     they part, and the two streams flow back to the starting point,\r\n     outside the following files. Thus in this perpetual\r\n     'follow-my-leader' way the work is done, with more precision and\r\n     steadiness than in the merchant service. Merchantmen are invariably\r\n     manned with the least possible number, and often go to sea\r\n     short-handed, even according to the parsimonious calculations of\r\n     their owners. The only way the heavier work can be done at all is\r\n     by each man doing his utmost at the same moment. This is regulated\r\n     by the song. And here is the true singing of the deep sea. It is\r\n     not recreation; it is an essential part of the work. It mastheads\r\n     the topsail yards, on making sail; it starts the anchor from the\r\n     domestic or foreign mud; it 'rides down the main tack with a will;'\r\n     it breaks out and takes on board a cargo; it keeps the pumps (the\r\n     ship's, not the sailor's) going. A good voice and a new and\r\n     stirring chorus are worth an extra man. And there is plenty of need\r\n     of both.\r\n\r\n     'I remember well one black night in the mid-Atlantic, when we were\r\n     beating up against a stiff breeze, coming on deck near midnight,\r\n     just as the ship was put about. When a ship is tacking, the tacks\r\n     and sheets (ropes which confine the clews or lower corners of the\r\n     sails) are let run, in order that the yards may be swung round to\r\n     meet the altered position of the ship. They must then be hauled\r\n     taut again, and belayed, or secured, in order to keep the sails in\r\n     their place and to prevent them from shaking. When the ship's head\r\n     comes up in the wind, the sail is for a moment or two edgewise to\r\n     it, and then is the nice moment, as soon as the headsails fairly\r\n     fill, when the mainyard and the yards above it can be swung\r\n     readily, and the tacks and sheets hauled in. If the crew are too\r\n     few in number, or too slow at their work, and the sails get fairly\r\n     filled on the new tack, it is a fatiguing piece of work enough to\r\n     'board' the tacks and sheets, as it is called. You are pulling at\r\n     one end of the rope--but the gale is tugging at the other. The\r\n     advantages of lungs are all against you, and perhaps the only thing\r\n     to be done is to put the helm down a little, and set the sails\r\n     shaking again before they can be trimmed properly. It was just at\r\n     such a time that I came on deck, as above mentioned. Being near\r\n     eight bells, the watch on deck had been not over spry; and the\r\n     consequence was that our big maincourse was slatting and flying out\r\n     overhead with a might that shook the ship from stem to stern. The\r\n     flaps of the mad canvas were like successive thumps of a giant's\r\n     fist upon a mighty drum. The sheets were jerking at the belaying\r\n     pins, the blocks rattling in sharp snappings like castanets. You\r\n     could hear the hiss and seething of the sea alongside, and see it\r\n     flash by in sudden white patches of phosphorescent foam, while all\r\n     over head was black with the flying scud. The English second mate\r\n     was stamping with vexation, and, with all his h's misplaced,\r\n     storming at the men: ''An'somely the weather mainbrace--'an'somely,\r\n     I tell you!--'Alf a dozen of you clap on to the main sheet\r\n     here--down with 'im!--D'y'see 'ere's hall like a midshipman's\r\n     bag--heverythink huppermost and nothing 'andy. 'Aul 'im in, Hi\r\n     say!' But the sail wouldn't come, though. All the most forcible\r\n     expressions of the Commination Service were liberally bestowed on\r\n     the watch. 'Give us the song, men!' sang out the mate, at\r\n     last--'pull with a will!--together men!--haltogether now!'--And\r\n     then a cracked, melancholy voice struck up this chant:\r\n\r\n         'Oh, the bowline, bully, bully bowline,\r\n          Oh, the bowline, bowline, HAUL!'\r\n\r\n     At the last word every man threw his whole strength into the\r\n     pull--all singing it in chorus, with a quick, explosive sound. And\r\n     so, jump by jump, the sheet was at last hauled taut.'\r\n\r\nIt would be well if the philanthropist and utilitarian would stoop to\r\nexamine these primeval but neglected facts, for there is no doubt that\r\nunder the healthful and delicious spell of Rhythm a far steadier and\r\ngreater amount of labor would be cheerfully and happily endured by the\r\nworking classes. The continuous but rhythmed croon of the negro when at\r\nwork, the yo-heave-o of the sailor straining at the cordage, the rowing\r\nsongs of the oarsman, etc., etc., are all suggestive of what might be\r\neffected by judicious effort in this direction. But man, ever wiser than\r\nhis Maker, neglects the intuitions of nature. Rendered conceited by a\r\nfalse education, and heartless by a constant craving for gold, he\r\nscorns the simple but deep intuitions which are his surest guide to\r\ncivilization, health, and cheerfulness. There can be no doubt that the\r\nphysical exercise so distasteful to the pale inhabitants of our cities,\r\nyet so essential for the preservation of health and life, might be\r\nrendered delightful and invigorating through the neglected powers of\r\nrhythmical motion. Like Michal, the proud daughter of Saul, who despised\r\nKing David in her haughty heart when 'she saw him dancing with all his\r\nmight before the Lord,' we scorn the simple and innocent delights of our\r\nnature, and, like Michal, we too are bitterly punished for our mistaken\r\npride of intellect, for, neglecting the rhythmical requisitions of the\r\nbody, we injure the mind, and may deprave the heart. Virtuously, purely,\r\nand judiciously applied to the amusements and artistic culture of a\r\npeople, we are convinced the power of Rhythm would banish much of that\r\ncraving for false excitement, for drinks and narcotics, an indulgence in\r\nwhich exerts so fatal an influence over the character and spiritual\r\nprogress of a nation. It is surely not astonishing that Rhythm should be\r\nso pleasant to the senses, when we consider that the laws of order and\r\nunity by which it is regulated are the proper aliment of the soul.\r\n\r\nStrange pedantries have grown out of the neglect of music as a practical\r\npervading element in modern education. We should endeavor to reform this\r\nfault; we should use this powerful engine of healing nature to remove\r\nfrom us the reproach of being merely a shopkeeping and money-making\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe wildest savage is not insensible to Rhythm. It fires his spirit in\r\nthe war dance and battle chant, soothes him in the monotonous hum of the\r\npow-wow, and softens him in naive love songs. It is the heart of music,\r\nand it can be proved that low and vulgar rhythms have a debasing effect\r\nupon the character of a people. 'Let me write the songs of a people,'\r\nsaid a great thinker, 'and I care not who makes its laws:'--if he\r\nincluded the tunes, there was no exaggeration in his thought. Alas! a\r\nmeretricious age scorns and neglects the true, because it is always\r\nsimple in its sublimity, and, striving to banish God from His own\r\ncreation, would also banish nature and joy from the heart! A pedantic\r\nage loves all that is pretentious, glaring, and assuming; and Rhythm\r\nstoops to rock the cradle of the newborn infant; to soothe the negro in\r\nthe rice swamp or cotton field; to shape into beauty the national and\r\npatriotic songs of a laborious but contented peasantry, as among the\r\nSclaves--but what cares the age for the happiness of the race? 'Put\r\nmoney in thy purse,' is its consolation and lesson for humanity.\r\n\r\nThe beat of the healthful heart is in unison with the feelings of the\r\nhour. Agitation makes it fitful and broken, excitement accelerates, and\r\nsorrow retards it. And this fact should be the model for all poetical\r\nand musical rhythm.\r\n\r\nTo show how readily we associate feelings with different orders of\r\nsound, let us suppose we are passing the night somewhere, where a\r\nstranger, utterly unknown to us, occupies a room from which we can hear\r\nthe sound of his footsteps. Suppose that through the tranquil hours of\r\nthe night we hear his measured tread falling in equally accented and\r\nmonotonous spondees, it is certain that a quick imagination will at once\r\nassociate this deliberate tread with the state of mind in the unknown\r\nfrom which it will believe it to proceed, and will immediately suggest\r\nthat the stranger is maturing some great design of heavy import to his\r\nfuture peace.\r\n\r\nShould the character of the spondaic tread suddenly change, should the\r\nfootsteps become rapid, eager, and broken, we look upon the term of\r\nmeditation and doubt as over, the resolve as definitely fixed, and the\r\nunknown as restlessly longing for the hour of its fulfilment.\r\n\r\nWhen we hear steps resembling dactyls, anapaests, and choriambs thrown\r\nhurriedly together, broken by irregular pauses, we begin to build a\r\nwhole romance on the steps of the stranger; we infer from them moments\r\nof grave deliberation; the languor consequent upon overwrought thought;\r\nrenewed effort; resolve; alternations of passion; hope struggling with\r\ndespair; until all at last seems merged in impatient longing for the\r\nhour of anticipated victory.\r\n\r\nNor has the imagination been alone in its strange workings; it has\r\nwhispered, as it always does, its secrets to the heart, and succeeded in\r\narousing its ever-ready affections, so that we cannot help feeling a\r\ndegree of interest in the unknown, whose emotions we have followed\r\nthrough the night, reading their history in his alternating footsteps:\r\n_for sounds impress themselves immediately upon the feelings, exciting,\r\nnot abstract or antagonistic thought, but uniting humanity in concrete\r\nfeeling_. (See vol. i.)\r\n\r\nAs the imagination necessarily associates different feelings with\r\ndifferent orders of Rhythm, it is the task of the Poet to select those\r\nin the closest conformity with the emotions he is struggling to excite.\r\nIt is positively certain that we not only naturally and intuitively\r\n_associate_ distinctive feelings with different orders of rhythmical\r\nsounds, but that varied emotions are _awakened_ by them. Some rhythms\r\ninspire calmness, some sublime and stately courage, some energy and\r\naggressive force, some stir the spirit to the most daring deeds, some,\r\nas in our maddening Tarantulas, produce a restless excitement through\r\nthe whole nervous system, some excite mere joyousness, some whisper love\r\nthrough every fibre of the heart, and some lead us in their holy calm\r\nand unbroken order to the throne of God. Why is this? We need not look\r\nin the region of the understanding for the philosophy of that which is\r\nto be found only in the living tide of basic emotions. The pleasure we\r\nreceive from Rhythm is a feeling. Alternate accentuation and\r\nnon-accentuation are facts in the living organism of the universe; this\r\nmay be expressed, not explained. There is an order in the living\r\nsuccession of musical sounds or poetic emotions, which order is\r\nexpressed by the words 'equality and proportion.' These things _are_.\r\nWhat more can be said? Do comparisons help us? the waves in the eternal\r\nocean of vitality--the shuttle strokes of the ever-moving loom of\r\ncreation! Let us take it as it is, and rejoice in it. We cannot tell you\r\nwhy we live--let us be glad that our life is music through every\r\nheart-throb!\r\n\r\nRhythm is a species of natural but inarticulate language, in which the\r\n_thought_ is never disengaged from the _feeling_; in language its aim\r\nshould be to awaken the _feeling_ properly attached to the thought it\r\nmodulates; it should be the _tune_ of the thought of the Poet. To write\r\na love song in alexandrines, an idyl in hexameters, would be to\r\nincarnate the shy spirit of a girl in the brawny frame of a Hercules, to\r\nincase the loving soul of a Juliet in a gauntleted Minerva. Genius and\r\ndeep sympathy with human nature can alone guide the Poet aright in this\r\ndelicate and difficult path; it lies too near the core of our\r\nunconscious being to be susceptible of the trim regularity of rule--he\r\nmust trust his own intuitions while he studies with care what has\r\nalready been successfully done by our best poets. We may however remark\r\nin passing that if the rhythm be abruptly broken without a corresponding\r\nbreak in the flow of thought or feeling, the reader will be confused,\r\nbecause the outward form has fallen into contradiction with its inner\r\nsoul, and he discerns the opposition, and knows not with which to\r\nsympathize. Such contrarieties argue want of power or want of freedom in\r\nthe poet, who should never suffer the clanking of his rhythmical chains\r\nto be heard. Such causeless breaks proceed from want of truth to the\r\nsubject, and prove a lack of the careful rendering of love in the\r\nauthor. The poet must listen to the naive voice of nature as he moulds\r\nhis rhythms, for the ingenious and elaborate constructions of the\r\nintellect alone will never touch the heart. Rhythm may proceed with\r\nregularity, yet that regularity be so relieved from monotony and so\r\nmodified in its actual effects, that however regular may be the\r\nstructure of parts, what is composed of them may be infinitely various.\r\nMilton's exquisite poem, 'Comus,' is an example of perfect rhythm with\r\nceaseless intricacy and great variety. It would indeed be a fatal\r\nmistake to suppose that _proportion_ cannot be susceptible of great\r\nvariety, since the whole meaning of the term has reference to the\r\nadjustment and proportional correspondence of _variable_ properties.\r\n\r\nThe appreciation of rhythm is universal, pertaining to no region, race,\r\nnor era, in especial. Even those who have never _thought_ about it,\r\n_feel_ order to be the law of life and happiness, and in the marking of\r\nthe _proportioned_ flow of time and the regular accentuation of its\r\n_determinate_ portions find a perpetual source of healthful pleasure.\r\n\r\nIf we will but think of it, we will be astonished how many ideas already\r\nanalyzed we may find exhibited through rhythm. We may have: similarity,\r\nvariety, identity, repetition, adaptation, symmetry, proportion,\r\nfitness, melody, harmony, order, and unity; in addition to the varied\r\nfeelings of which it becomes the symbolic utterance. The Greeks placed\r\nrhythms in the hands of a god, thus testifying to their knowledge of\r\ntheir range and power.\r\n\r\nWordsworth asserts that\r\n\r\n     'More pathetic situations and sentiments, that is, those which have\r\n     a greater proportion of pain connected with them, may be endured in\r\n     metrical compositions than in prose.'\r\n\r\nThe reason of this seems to be that the bright beams forever raying from\r\nthe Divine Sun of unity and order, shine through the measured beat of\r\nthe rhythm, and are always felt as life and peace, even when their\r\ngolden light is broken by the wild and drifting clouds of human woe, or\r\nseen athwart the surging and blinding mists of mortal anguish.\r\n\r\nRhythm lurks in the inmost heart of language, accenting our words that\r\ntheir enunciation may be clear and distinct; lengthening and shortening\r\nthe time of our syllables that they may be expressive, emotional, and\r\nmusical. Let the orator as well as the poet study its capabilities; it\r\nhas more power over the sympathies of the masses than the most labored\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAlthough through the quantitive arrangement and determinate accentuation\r\nof syllabic sound, rhythm may be exquisitely manifested through\r\nlanguage, yet in music alone does it attain its full power and wonderful\r\ncomplexity. For the _tones_ are not _thoughts_, but _feelings_, and\r\nyield themselves implicitly to the loving hand which would reunite them\r\nand form them into higher unities. These passionate tones, always\r\nseeking for and surging into each other, are plastic pearls on the\r\nstring of rhythm, whose proportions may be indefinitely varied at the\r\nwill of the fond hand which would wreathe them into strands of\r\nsymmetrical beauty; while _words_, the vehicles of antagonistic thought,\r\nfrequently refuse to conform to the requisitions of feeling, are often\r\nobstinate and wilful, will not be remodelled, and hard, in their\r\nself-sufficiency, refuse to bear any stamp save that of their known and\r\nfixed value. Like irregular beads of uncut coral, they protrude their\r\nindividualities in jagged spikes and unsightly thorns, breaking often\r\nthe unity of the whole, and painfully wounding the sense of order.\r\n\r\nThe true poet overcomes these difficulties. When, in the hands of a\r\nmaster, they are forced to bend under the onward and impetuous sweep of\r\nthe passionate rhythm, compelled to sing the tune of the overpowering\r\nemotions--the chords of the spirit quiver in response. The heart\r\nrecognizes the organic law of its own life: _the constant recurrence of\r\nnew effort sinking but to recover itself in accurately proportioned\r\nrest, rising again in ever-renewed exertion, to sink again in ever-new\r\nrepose_; feeling seems clothing itself with living form, while the\r\ndivine attribute, Order, marks for the ear, as it links in mystic Unity,\r\nthe flying footsteps of that forever invisible element by which all\r\nmortal being is conditioned and limited: TIME!\r\n\r\n  'There is no architect\r\n     Can build as the Muse can;\r\n   She is skilful to select\r\n     Materials for her plan.\r\n\r\n  'She lays her beams in music,\r\n     In music every one,\r\n   To the cadence of the whirling world\r\n     Which dances round the sun.\r\n\r\n  'That so they shall not be displaced\r\n     By lapses or by wars,\r\n   But for the love of happy souls\r\n     Outlive the newest stars.'\r\n                            EMERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'OUR ARTICLE.'\r\n\r\n'John,' said I to my husband, as he came home from business, and settled\r\ninto an armchair for half an hour's rest before dinner, 'I think of\r\nwriting an article for THE CONTINENTAL MONTHLY.'\r\n\r\n'Humph!' said my husband.\r\n\r\nNow 'humph' bears different interpretations; it may argue assent,\r\nindifference, disgust, disapprobation--in all cases it is aggressive;\r\nbut this 'humph' seemed to be a combination of at least three of the\r\nabove-mentioned frames of mind.\r\n\r\nNatural indignation was about taking full possession of me, but\r\nreflection stepped in, and I preserved a discreet silence. The truth is,\r\nno man should be assailed by a new idea before he has dined, and I,\r\nhaving had three years' opportunity of studying man nature, met my\r\ndeserts when the above answer was given. So I still looked amiable, and\r\nbehaved very prettily till dinner was over, and then John, having\r\nsubsided into dressing gown, slippers, easy chair, and good nature, I\r\nremarked again:\r\n\r\n'John, I think of writing an article for THE CONTINENTAL\r\nMONTHLY.'\r\n\r\n'How shall you begin it?' said he.\r\n\r\n'Well, I haven't exactly settled on a beginning yet, but--'\r\n\r\n'Exactly! I supposed so!' remarked this barbarian.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he knew my weak point, for hadn't he been allowed to see\r\na desk full of magnificent middles, only wanting a beginning and an end,\r\nand a publisher, and some readers, to place me in the front ranks of our\r\nmodern essayists, side by side with 'Spare Hours,' and the 'Country\r\nParson,' and 'Gail Hamilton?'\r\n\r\nThe fact is, I have always been brimming over with brilliant ideas on\r\nall sorts of subjects, which never would arrange themselves or be\r\narranged under any given head, but presented a series of remarkable\r\nliterary fragments, jotted down on stray bits of paper, in old account\r\nbooks and diaries, and even, on one or two occasions, when seized by a\r\nsudden inspiration, on a smooth stone, taken from the brook, a fair\r\nsheet of birch bark, and the front of a pew in a white-painted country\r\nchurch. Having been subject to these inspirational attacks for many\r\nyears, I had decided to take them in hand, and, if they must come,\r\nderive some benefit from them. An idea suggested itself. Claude\r\nLorraine, it is said, never put the figures in his landscapes, but left\r\nthat work for some brother artist. Now I could bring together material\r\nfor an article; the inspiration, the picturing should be mine, but John\r\nshould put in the figures. In other words, he should polish it, write\r\nthe introduction and the _finis_, and send it out to the public, as the\r\nwork of 'my wife and I.'\r\n\r\nThen a question occurred: how should we divide the honors, supposing\r\nsuch an article should really find its way into print? Would there not\r\nbe material for a standard quarrel in the fact that neither could claim\r\nsole proprietorship? What would be John's sensation, should any one say\r\nto him: 'Mr. ----, I have just been reading your wife's last article;\r\ncapital thing!' and, _vice versa_, imagine the same thing said of me.\r\nCould I preserve amiability under such circumstances, and would not the\r\nresult be, a divorce in a year, and a furious lawsuit as to the\r\nownership of the copyright? John certainly is magnanimous, I thought,\r\nbut no one cares for divided honors, and there is that middle-aged\r\nrelation of his, with a figure like a vinegar cruet, and a voice as acid\r\nas its contents, who never comes here for a day without doing her best\r\nto set us by the ears, and who, in the beginning of our married life,\r\nwhen we did not understand each other quite so well as now, sometimes\r\nsucceeded, to her intense satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHow she would go about among all the friends and relations, pulling the\r\npoor articles to pieces, giving all the fine bits to John and the\r\nrubbish to me, and hinting generally that my pretensions to authorship\r\nwere all very well, but that every one knew John did the work and I\r\nlooked out for the credit.\r\n\r\nHere I paused. I had been successfully engaged in the pursuit of\r\ntrouble, and had conjured up so irritating a picture, that actually a\r\nsmall tear had left its source, and was running over the bridge of my\r\nnose!\r\n\r\n'John,' I said, 'notwithstanding that I never did know how to begin\r\nanything in an effective way, I am still determined to write, and you\r\nmust help me.'\r\n\r\nThen I opened my heart to him, and told him my plan, and the imagined\r\ntribulation it had given me in the last ten minutes.\r\n\r\n'There are too many writers already, Helen,' he said; 'every man who\r\ncannot see his way clear through life--every woman who fancies herself\r\nmisunderstood and unappreciated, worries out a book or poem or a set of\r\nessays, to picture their individual wrongs and sufferings, and bores\r\nevery publisher of every magazine and paper of which they have ever\r\nheard, till he is tormented into printing, or dies of manuscript on the\r\nbrain. I tell you, Helen, we do our share in aggravating the people we\r\nmeet daily, without tormenting an innocent man, 'who never did us any\r\nharm;' and I for one, don't want an extra sin on my conscience.\r\nMoreover, I am afraid it would spoil you, should you happen to succeed.\r\nHave you forgotten your old friend Angelina Hobbs? One article ruined\r\nher for life. Until that poem got into print and was favorably noticed,\r\nshe was as sensible as ordinary girls, and never imagined herself a\r\ngenius. Since then, there is not an 'ism' in America that she has not\r\ntaken up and run into the ground; I have met her in every stage, from\r\nthe coat and pantaloons of the Bloomer ten years ago to the hoopless old\r\nmaid I saw yesterday going into Dodworth's Hall with the last spiritual\r\npaper and a spirit photograph in her hand. Not a literary man or woman\r\ndo I know, who has not some crotchet in his or her brain, and who does\r\nnot in some way violate the harmonies of life at least once an hour. Be\r\ncontent as you are: be satisfied to live without seeing yourself in\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL MONTHLY, or any other monthly under the sun!'\r\n\r\n'John,' I said, 'I am surprised, I am astonished at the view you take of\r\nthe case. I don't desire that publishers should be tormented into their\r\ngraves; and if they are all as fat and rosy as the two we met the other\r\nday, I think you can dismiss all fears on that score. Moreover, I\r\nbelieve the world to be better for every book that is written, however\r\ninsignificant it may be. The days of the corsairs and giaours, romantic\r\nrobbers, and devout murderers, are over: our young ladies and our\r\nservant girls see no fascination in the pages of 'Fatherless Fanny,'\r\n'The Foundling,' or 'The Mysteries of Slabtown.' Arthur's stories and\r\nten thousand others of the same class have taken their place, and\r\ncommonplace as they may often be, have brought a healthier influence\r\ninto action. No book written with an honest heart is lost; no poem or\r\nessay, however poor, fails to reach some mark. The printed page that to\r\nyou or me looks so barren and poor, may carry to some soul a message of\r\nhealing; may to some eyes have the light of heaven about it. And to how\r\nmany aimless lives, writing has given a purpose which otherwise never\r\nmight have entered it! John, I believe in writing, and this baby shall\r\nbe taught to put his ideas into shape as soon as he is taught anything!\r\nI never wish him to settle down in the belief that he is a genius and\r\ncan live on the fact; but he shall write if he can, and publish too, if\r\nany one will do it for him. If not, we will have a private printing\r\npress of our own, and get up an original library for our descendants.'\r\n\r\n'A genuine woman's answer,' said John; 'only one point in it touching\r\nupon my argument.' Here the baby opened his blue eyes wide. 'There!'\r\nsaid John; 'just for the present your life has a purpose, and we can\r\ndispense with writing, at least till that fellow is asleep again. When\r\nyou have disposed of him, we will find out how many aims it is necessary\r\nfor one woman to have, and what arrangement of them it is best to make.'\r\n\r\nThe baby stayed awake obstinately, but I was reconciled to the fact, for\r\nour discussion might have become hot, and the writing ended for that\r\nevening quite as effectually as the baby had done it.\r\n\r\nNight came again, and this time John opened the subject, by placing\r\nbefore me a large package of foolscap, and a new gold pen.\r\n\r\n'I have brought some paper for you to spoil, Helen,' he said, 'for I\r\nforesaw how it would end. Do your best, and I will do mine in the matter\r\nof beginnings. I cannot write easily, you know, but I can suggest and\r\ndictate, when you wish it; and you have been my amanuensis for a year\r\nand more, so it will all seem very natural.'\r\n\r\nHe looked down, as he spoke, at the scarred right hand and its missing\r\nfingers, carried away eighteen months before by a rebel bullet, and a\r\nlittle shade passed over his face.\r\n\r\n'No, John,' I said, 'don't look there now; look at my two hands waiting\r\nto do the work of that, and tell me if two are not better than one. We\r\nwill write an article which shall astonish the critics, and bring\r\nletters from all the magazines, begging us to become special\r\ncontributors at once; and we will not quarrel as to who shall have the\r\nglory, but make it a joint matter. And now I am ready to begin, and\r\npropose to speak upon a subject which I wonder greatly no one has taken\r\nup in detail before. Your words last evening brought out some dormant\r\nideas. 'We do our share in aggravating the people we meet daily,' you\r\nsaid, and I have been reflecting upon the matter ever since, till now I\r\nam prepared to give my opinions to the world.'\r\n\r\nSo saying, I arranged the table properly, took out some sheets of the\r\nsmooth, white paper, filled my pen, and waited for the dawning of an\r\nidea. To which it came first, I shall not tell you. The results are\r\nbefore you: which part is John's, which mine, you will never learn from\r\nus. It will be of no avail for you to write to the editors, for they\r\ndon't know either, and will not be told. It will be a useful exercise\r\nfor you to dissect the article, and set apart the masculine from the\r\nfeminine portions. The critics will for once be quite at a loss how to\r\nabuse it, probably. I foresee a general distraction in the minds of our\r\nreaders, and already hear ourselves classed as among one of the trials\r\nwhich I select as the title of 'Our Article.'\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OF THE AGGRAVATIONS OF LIVING.\r\n\r\nTwo thirds of life in the aggregate are made up of aggravations. They\r\nbegin with our beginning, and only cease with our ending; perhaps, if\r\ngood Calvinists speak the truth, not even then, for, according to their\r\nbelief, the souls in torment look always upon the blessed in heaven, and\r\nthis surely is the most horrible species of aggravation ever devised by\r\nman or fiend.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when the air first fills the lungs and the infant screams\r\nat the new sensation, to the day when fingers press down the resisting\r\nlids and straighten the stiffening limbs, we are forced to meet and to\r\nbear all manner of aggravations in nine tenths of our daily life.\r\n\r\nHas it ever occurred to any of you what an amount of unnecessary\r\nsuffering an infant endures, and have you ever watched the operations it\r\nundergoes daily, with reference to the confirming of this fact? If not,\r\nan inexhaustible field of inquiry lies open before you, and after a\r\nweek's observation of bandages rolled till the flesh actually\r\nsqueaks--of pins stuck in and left, where you know they will prick--of\r\nsmotherings in blankets and garrotings with bibs--of trottings for the\r\nwind and poundings for the stomach ache--of wakings up to show to\r\nvisitors, and puttings to sleep when sleep is at the other end of the\r\nland of Nod, and will not be induced to come under any circumstances--of\r\nrockings and tossings--of boiling catnip tea and smooth horrible castor\r\noil poured down the unsuspecting throat--after a week of such\r\nobservations, I say, you will decide with me that the baby's life is\r\nonly a series of aggravations, and feel astonished the bills of infant\r\nmortality do not double and treble.\r\n\r\nAs years round out the little life, the hands, reaching out to the tree\r\nof knowledge, find themselves pushed back on all sides. The dearest\r\nwishes are made light of, the most earnest desires slighted, the most\r\nsacred thoughts ridiculed, till one marvels that men can grow up\r\nanything but devils. In the path where Gail Hamilton's feet have trod I\r\nneed not follow, for she has told us what these 'Happiest Days' are, in\r\nbetter words than my pen can find. It warmed my heart as I read her\r\nprotest against the platitudes concerning childhood and its various\r\nimagined delights. Mentally I shook hands, for she expressed my ideas so\r\nfully, that the notes I had long ago jotted down upon the subject I\r\ncommitted at once to the flames, satisfied I never could do any better,\r\nand might possibly do very much worse.\r\n\r\nI believe that the major part of sour-tempered, perversely wrong-headed,\r\nand unhappily disposed people, of hot-headed fanatics, victims to one\r\nidea, of once noble souls who sink themselves in sensuality, and so go\r\ndown to death, and of all the sad cases one hears and reads of day after\r\nday and year after year, are made so through unceasing aggravation at\r\nthe most impressible time of life. Do any of you who may be my readers\r\nknow of half a dozen happy families in your circle of friends and\r\nacquaintance? Do you know of half a dozen where boys prefer home and\r\ntheir sisters to the streets, or where girls do not court the most\r\nuninviting boy in preference to their own brothers?\r\n\r\nOne would almost imagine spite had been the feeling implanted in all\r\nhomes, as they look at the private pinch exchanged between John and\r\nJames, the face made by Mary at which Martha cries and is slapped by way\r\nof adjusting matters, and the general refusal of requests made to father\r\nand mother, whether reasonable or not. My own childhood was moderately\r\nhappy, and yet I recall now the sense of burning indignation I sometimes\r\nsuffered at wrongs done me, which the child's sense of justice told me\r\nwere wrongs, and which I now know to have been so. Children are\r\nthemselves one of the aggravations of living, but it is because we do\r\nnot know how to treat them. I look for a time when every father shall be\r\njust, every mother reasonable as well as loving; when children shall\r\nneither be flogged up the way of life as in times past, or coaxed up\r\nwith sugarplums as in times present, but, seeing with clear eyes the\r\nstraight path, shall walk in it with joy, and finish their course with\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\nAnother aggravation, and not a minor one either it strikes me, is the\r\nsummary way in which youth is put down by middle-aged and aged people.\r\nYouthful emotions are 'bosh and twaddle,' youthful ideas, 'crude, sir,\r\nvery crude!' and youthful attempts to be and to do something in the\r\nworld frowned at, as if action of any sort, save inaction, before forty,\r\nwere an outrage on humanity, and an insult to the Creator.\r\n\r\nHow fares it with young professional men during the first ten years of\r\ntheir career? They hope and wait, doubt and wait, curse and wait, labor\r\nto wait, and in the mean time a wheezing old lawyer, with no more\r\nenthusiasm than a brickbat, takes the cases which Justice, if she were\r\nnot blind, would have sent to his starving younger brethren, and pockets\r\nfat fees, a tenth of which would have lifted loads from many a heavy\r\nheart. An old family physician, an old minister, an old lawyer, are\r\nexcellent in their way, and have a variety of pleasant associations with\r\nthem, which it is impossible to pass over to the young aspirant who\r\nsteps in to take their place; yet because Dr. Jones, aged sixty-eight,\r\ncarried us safely through the measles, does it follow that Dr. Smith,\r\naged twenty-eight, cannot do the same for our children?\r\n\r\nBecause for thirty years the Rev. Dr. Holdfast has preached upon\r\nelection, and justification by faith, is the Rev. Dr. Holeman to be set\r\ndown as presumptuously progressive, because he suggests works as a test\r\nof the faith we profess, and ventures to speak of God, not as the stern\r\nDeity who commands us all to be afraid of Him, and who drops lost souls\r\ninto the pit with a calm satisfaction, but as the loving Father of the\r\nworld, who wills that all men should come to the knowledge of His truth.\r\n\r\nIt is well for the old to give us their experience, well for the young\r\nto listen, but every man and every woman lives a life of their own,\r\nwhich the widest experience cannot touch at all points. No two natures\r\nhave ever been nor ever can be exactly alike; no rules of the past can\r\nform the present in the same mould. Girls and boys, young men and women,\r\nmust 'see the folly' for themselves, and all the advice and warning of\r\nall the ancestors under heaven cannot prevent it. Therefore, O\r\nmiddle-aged aunt, or white-haired grandparent, aggravate by unceasing\r\nadvice, if you will, but be not aggravated if it isn't taken. Reflect as\r\nto how fully you availed yourself of the experience of _your_\r\ngrandparents when you were young, and then make your demands\r\naccordingly. Tell the young the story of your life as a story, and they\r\nwill listen and mayhap profit; give it as advice, and you shall see them\r\nkeep as far off as circumstances will admit. It is my fixed belief that\r\nuntil the people in the world have learned how to hold their tongues, it\r\nwill be entirely useless to read Dr. Cumming; believe in the Great\r\nTribulation as much as you please, for it is about us all day long, but\r\ndon't look out for the Millennium, which I think will consist entirely\r\nin people's minding their own business.\r\n\r\nIn the inability or unwillingness of people to let other people alone,\r\nmay be summed up all the aggravation of living. The bane of my life has\r\nbeen never being let alone. People seem to think they have come into the\r\nworld with a special mission to give me advice, and from my babyhood up,\r\nI have never been allowed to carry out the best-arranged plan of\r\noperation, without interference. As each man and woman is the\r\nrepresentative of a certain class, I conclude others have had the same\r\nexperience with myself; and there is a gloomy satisfaction in reflecting\r\nthat there are many who have been made as essentially uncomfortable as\r\nI. The result has been, I have come to the unalterable determination\r\nnever, under any circumstances, to either advise anybody or receive it\r\nmyself where it can be avoided. If it is ordained that I am to make a\r\nfool of myself, it shall be done on my own responsibility, and not with\r\nthe assistance of meddling friends--though if they have any desire to\r\ntake the credit of it, I shall make no objections whatever. I doubt if\r\nthey will. The longer I live in the world, the clearer appears the fact\r\nthat half at least of our unhappiness is unnecessary. We seem perversely\r\nbent on tormenting and being tormented. We visit people for whom we do\r\nnot care one straw, because our position in society or our interests\r\ndemand it. We sacrifice our own judgment to the whims of others as a\r\nmatter of expediency, and almost ignore our own capacity in the\r\neagerness to agree with everybody. We suffer because a rich snob snubs\r\nus, and agonize over unfavorable remarks made concerning our abilities\r\nor standing. These things ought not so to be. No man can find a\r\nsubstitute when he lies a-dying;--why should all his years be spent in\r\nthe vain endeavor to find a substitute for living? An endless dependence\r\nupon the opinions, the whims, the prejudices of others, is the bane of\r\nliving, and the mark of a weak mind, made so oftener by education than\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWhen the young forget to abuse the old, and the old to run down the\r\nyoung; when mothers-in-law cease to hate their daughters-in-law, and to\r\nimprove all opportunities for sowing strife; when wives take pains to\r\nunderstand their husbands, and husbands decide that woman nature is\r\nworth studying; when women can remember to be charitable to other women;\r\nwhen the Golden Rule can be read as it is written, and not 'Do unto\r\nothers as ye would _not_ they should do unto you;' when justice and\r\ntruth rule men, rather than unreason and petty spite, then the\r\naggravation of living will die a natural death, and the world become as\r\ncomfortable an abiding place as its inhabitants need desire.\r\n\r\nTill then, hope and wait. Live the life God gives us, as purely and\r\ntruly as you know how. Have some faith in human nature, but more in God,\r\nand wait his own good time for the perfect life, not to be reached here,\r\nbut hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LESSON OF THE WOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the same soil the family of trees\r\n  Spring up, and, like a band of brothers, grow\r\n  In the same sun, while from their leafy lips\r\n  Comes not the faintest whisper of dissent\r\n  Because of various girth and grain and hue.\r\n  The oak flings not his acorns at the elm;\r\n  The white birch shrinks not from the swarthy ash;\r\n  The green plume of the pine nods to the shrub;\r\n  The loftiest monarch of the realm of wood\r\n  Spares not his crown in elemental storms,\r\n  But shares the blows with trees of humbler growth,\r\n  And stretches forth his arms to save their fall.\r\n  Wild flowers festoon the feet of all alike;\r\n  Green mosses grow upon the trunks of all;\r\n  Sweet birds pour out their songs on every bough;\r\n  Clouds drop baptismal showers of rain on each,\r\n  And the broad sun floods every leaf with light.\r\n  Behold them clad in Autumn's golden pomp--\r\n  Their rich magnificence, of different dyes,\r\n  More beautiful than royal robes, and crowns\r\n  Of emperors on coronation day.\r\n  But the deserted nest in silence sways\r\n  Like a sad heart beneath a royal scarf;\r\n  And the red tint upon the maple leaves\r\n  Is colored like the fields where fell our braves\r\n  In hurricanes of flame and leaden hail.\r\n  I love to gaze up at the grand old trees;\r\n  Their branches point like hope to Heaven serene;\r\n  Their roots point to the silent world that's dead;\r\n  Their grand old trunks hold towns and fleets for us,\r\n  And cots and coffins for the race unborn.\r\n  When at their feet their predecessors fell,\r\n  Spring covered their remains with mourning moss,\r\n  And wrote their epitaph in pale wood flowers,\r\n  And Summer gave ripe berries to the birds\r\n  To stay and sing their sad sweet requiem;\r\n  And Autumn rent the garments of the trees\r\n  That stood mute mourners in a field of graves,\r\n  And Winter wrapped them in a winding sheet.\r\n  They seemed like giants sleeping in their shrouds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARY OF FRANCES KRASINSKA;\r\n\r\nOR, LIFE IN POLAND DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CASTLE OF JANOWIEC,\r\n  Wednesday, _May 27th, 1760._\r\n\r\nI had hoped too much! He is going, and the memory of the past will\r\nrender the days to come very sad. I knew that Monday was an unlucky day:\r\nsince my maid gave me such a fright by announcing the approaching\r\ndeparture of the princes, all has gone from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nThe huntsman who brought me the bouquet from the prince, told me, in his\r\nname, that he too was forced to depart. With great difficulty could he\r\ninvent a pretext for remaining three days after his brothers left. These\r\nthree days will not expire until to-morrow, and yet he leaves me to-day;\r\nhe must go, and can no longer delay. The king has sent an express for\r\nhim, with an order to return as soon as possible. He will leave in one\r\nhalf hour, and I do not know when we can meet again. Ah! how soon\r\nhappiness passes away!...\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday, _June 7th._\r\n\r\nIt is now two weeks since the prince royal left me; he has sent two\r\nexpresses, and slipped two notes for me under cover to the prince\r\npalatine. But what is a letter?... An unfinished thought--it soothes for\r\na moment, but cannot calm. A letter can never replace even a few seconds\r\nof personal intercourse; he has left me his portrait; I am sure every\r\none would think it like him; but for me, it is merely a shred of\r\ninanimate canvas. It has his features, but it is not he, and has not his\r\nexpression.... I have him much better in my memory.\r\n\r\nAll consolation is denied me, for I will not reply to his letters; this\r\nrestraint I have imposed upon myself; I am sure that my hand would\r\nbecome motionless as the cold marble were I to write to the man I love\r\nwithout the knowledge of my aunt, my elder sister, and my parents. I\r\ntold the prince royal that he could never have a letter from me until I\r\nwas his wife. This is a great sacrifice, but I have promised my God that\r\nI will accomplish it.\r\n\r\nSince his departure, time weighs upon me as a continued torture. During\r\nthe first few days I wandered about as if bereft of reason; I could not\r\nfix my thoughts, or apply myself to any occupation. The illness of the\r\nprincess has restored some energy to my soul. The injury to her foot,\r\nwhich she at first neglected, has become very serious; during three days\r\nshe had a burning fever, which threatened her life. My anguish was\r\nbeyond description; I am sure I could not have been more uneasy had it\r\nbeen my sister or one of my parents. I scarcely thought of the prince\r\nroyal during the whole of those three days; and what is most strange, I\r\nno longer regretted his absence; if he had been here, I could not have\r\ndevoted myself so entirely to the princess. The idea of her death was\r\nterrible to me, for, notwithstanding all the arguments of the prince\r\nroyal and of the Princes Lubomirski, I feel myself very culpable in\r\nhaving withheld my confidence from her; if she suspects the truth, she\r\nhas every reason to accuse me of perfidy.... There is in this world but\r\none inconsolable evil, and that is the torture of a bad\r\nconscience--remorse....\r\n\r\nI hoped one day to be able to repair my wrongs toward the princess, to\r\nfall at her feet and confess my fault, but when I saw her in danger, I\r\nfelt as if hell itself were menacing me, and as if I must be forever\r\ncrushed under the weight of an eternal remorse.... Another thought too\r\nhas distressed me to the very bottom of my soul! My parents are advanced\r\nin years; if I should lose them before I have confessed my secret to\r\nthem! It is written above that I am to know every sorrow! Heaven has\r\ncruelly tried me, but to-day a ray of pity seems to have fallen upon my\r\nmiserable fate. The princess is steadily improving, and I have received\r\ngood news from Maleszow; I breathe again.\r\n\r\nWere the king to give his consent to our marriage, I could not be\r\nhappier than I was on hearing from the physician's own mouth that the\r\nprincess was out of danger.... I will then be able to open my heart to\r\nher! Ah! my God! if this painful dissimulation weighs so heavily upon\r\nme, what must be the state of the prince royal, who is deceiving his\r\nfather, his king, and offending him by a misplaced affection!\r\n\r\nWhy did not these reflections present themselves to me before? Why did I\r\nnot show him the abyss into which we were about to fall?... My happiness\r\nthen blinded me, and now I can fancy no condition which I would not\r\nprefer to my own.... I feel humiliated by my imprudence. Did I not, with\r\nthe whole strength of my wishes and desires draw upon me this very love\r\nso dear to my heart and so fatal to my repose? My pride has lost me; and\r\nthat pride is an implacable enemy, which I have no longer strength to\r\nsubdue. Oh! I must indeed blame our little Matthias! It was he who first\r\nawoke such ambitious dreams within my soul.\r\n\r\nHappy Barbara! If I only, like her, loved a man of rank equal to my own!\r\nBut no, I am not of good faith with myself: the prince royal's position\r\ndazzled me. Ah! how merciful is heaven to cover our innermost thoughts\r\nwith an impenetrable veil! Alas! God pardons the defects in our frail\r\nhumanity sooner than we ourselves can!\r\n\r\nI left the princess half an hour ago, and must now return to her; she\r\nloves so to have me with her! And indeed, no one can wait upon her as\r\nwell as myself. I feel happy when sitting at her bedside; I regain\r\ncourage when I think that I am useful to her, and I feel a kind of joy\r\nin finding that my heart is not occupied by one sentiment to the\r\nexclusion of all others.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLE OF OPOLE, Thursday, _June 18th._\r\n\r\nThe princess has entirely recovered, and we have been three days at\r\nOpole. I was sorry to leave Janowiec, for all around me bore the impress\r\nof his presence. In his last letter, he announces a very sad piece of\r\nnews: he is forced to pass two months in his duchy of Courland. He will\r\nendeavor to see me before he goes; but will he succeed? Two months! how\r\nmany centuries, when one must wait!\r\n\r\nWe have had several visitors from Warsaw; among others, Adam Krasinski,\r\nBishop of Kamieniec; he is in every way estimable, and universally\r\nesteemed! All speak of the change in the prince royal: he is pale and\r\nsad, and flies the world. The king himself is uneasy concerning his son,\r\nand it is I who am the cause of all this woe. Is love then a\r\nnever-ending source of sorrow? He suffers for me, and his suffering is\r\nmy most cruel torment.... They say too that I am changed, and believe me\r\nill: the good princess attributes my pallor to the nights I have watched\r\nby her side. Her manifestations of interest pierce my heart! When shall\r\nI be at peace with my conscience?\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday, _July 11th._\r\n\r\nLike a flash of lightning has a single ray of happiness shone out and\r\nthen disappeared. He came here to see me, but could remain only two\r\nhours. Last Wednesday he left Warsaw, as if he were going to Courland,\r\nbut, sending his carriages before him on the way to the north, he turned\r\naside and hastened here. His court awaited him at Bialystok, and he was\r\nforced to travel night and day to avoid suspicion. I saw him for so\r\nshort a time that those few happy moments seem only a dream. He was\r\nobliged to assume his huntsman's dress in order to gain admittance\r\nunknown into the castle.\r\n\r\nNo one penetrated his disguise, and no one except the prince palatine\r\nwas cognizant of our interview. He spoke to me, he gave me repeated\r\nassurances of his love, and restored to me my dearest hopes; had he not\r\ndone so, I feel I should have died before the expiration of the three\r\nmonths. Three months is the very least that he can remain at Mittau. How\r\nmany days, how many hours, how many minutes in those three months! I\r\ncould be more resigned were I alone to suffer; but he is so unhappy at\r\nour separation!\r\n\r\n\r\nThursday, _September 3d._\r\n\r\nI have neglected my journal during nearly two months. Good and evil, all\r\npasses in this world. My days have been sad and monotonous, but they are\r\ngone, and their flight brings me nearer to my happiness. The prince\r\nroyal assures me in all his letters that he will return in October. I\r\nwas crazy with joy to-day when I found the leaves were falling: I am\r\ncharmed with this foretaste of autumn. We will leave for Warsaw in a\r\nvery few days.\r\n\r\nA new incident has lately come to pass: a very brilliant match has been\r\noffered for me, and the princess, who loves me twice as well since I\r\nnursed her through her illness, after having concerted the marriage with\r\nmy parents and the Bishop of Kamieniec, hoped to win my consent. I was\r\nforced to bear her anger and reproaches, and worse than all that, the\r\nbitter allusions which she made to the prince royal....\r\n\r\nTo satisfy my parents, I was obliged to humiliate myself, and write a\r\nletter of excuse; my mother deigned to send me a reply filled with\r\nsorrow, but without anger. She ends her letter by saying: 'Parents who\r\nsend their children away from them, must expect to find them rebellious\r\nto their will.'\r\n\r\nMy poor mother! She still gives me her sacred blessing, and assures me\r\nof my father's forgiveness! Ah! I purchase very dearly my future\r\nhappiness and greatness!\r\n\r\n\r\nWARSAW, Tuesday, _September 22d._\r\n\r\nWe returned to Warsaw several days ago. Ah! with what joy did I find\r\nmyself once more here; how beautiful this city is! Here I will often see\r\nthe prince royal. He assures me in his last letter that he will return\r\nby the first of October; I have then only one week to wait; without this\r\nhope I should no longer have any desire to live. Nothing now gives me\r\nany pleasure. Dress tires and annoys me, visits and assemblies weary me\r\nto death; every person whom I meet seems to me a scrutinizing judge; I\r\nfancy that all are pitying or blaming me. Especially do I fear the women\r\nof my acquaintance; they are not indulgent, because they are never\r\ndisinterested; they are no better pleased with another woman's good\r\nfortune than they are with her beauty and agreeability....\r\n\r\nEven yesterday, with what cruelty Madame ----, but I will not write her\r\nname--questioned me! She enjoyed my confusion; I was almost ready to\r\nweep, and she was delighted. In the presence of fifty persons, she\r\nrevenged herself for what is called _my triumph_, but what I consider\r\nthe most _sacred happiness_. Ah! how deeply she wounded me! I almost\r\nhate her.... This feeling alone was wanting to complete the torment of\r\nmy soul. The prince palatine took pity on me, and came to my aid; may\r\nGod reward him! In every difficult crisis he is always near with his\r\nactive and powerful friendship. He would be quite perfect, if he only\r\nunderstood me a little better; but when I weep and show my sorrow, he\r\nlaughs and calls me a child.... I cannot tell him everything.\r\n\r\nThursday, _October 1st._\r\n\r\nHe has come, and I have seen him; he is quite well, and yet I am not\r\nhappy. I saw him amid a crowd of indifferent people; and when my\r\nfeelings impelled me to run and meet him in the palace court, I was\r\nforced to remain by my work table and wait until he came into the\r\nsaloon, when he of course first saluted the princess, and my only\r\nconsolation consisted in being able to make him a formal and icy\r\nreverence. But he is come, and all must now go well.\r\n\r\n\r\n_October 12th._\r\n\r\nGreat God! how sweet are the words to which I have just given utterance!\r\nHappy, a thousand times happy, is the woman who can promise with all her\r\nheart to give her hand during her whole life to him whom she loves! The\r\nfourth of November is the prince's birthday. He desires, he demands,\r\nthat this may be the day of our holy union! He made me swear by my God,\r\nand by my parents, that I would no longer oppose his wishes; he said he\r\nwould doubt my affection if I still hesitated. His tears and prayers\r\novercame me; encouraged by the advice of the prince palatine, I promised\r\nall he desired, and already do I repent my weakness. But he--he was\r\nhappy when he left me....\r\n\r\nHe wished our marriage to be kept secret from my parents, as it must be\r\nduring some time from the rest of the world; he desired that the Princes\r\nLubomirski should be our only witnesses and our only confidants; but I\r\nopposed this project with all my strength; I even threatened him with\r\nbecoming a nun rather than play so guilty a part toward my parents. He\r\nfinally yielded: he is so kind to me. It was then decided that I should\r\nwrite to my parents, and that he would add a postscript to my letter.\r\n\r\nAt first I felt grateful to him for his submission; but with a little\r\nmore reflection I felt offended. Is it not he who should write to my\r\nparents? Is it not thus that such affairs are conducted? Alas, yes; but\r\nonly when one weds an equal! It is a prince, a prince of the blood royal\r\nwho _deigns_ to unite himself to me! He then does me a favor in wedding\r\nme.... This thought has become so bitter that I was on the point of\r\nretracting; but it is too late, for I have given my word.\r\n\r\nI must now write to my parents; I must confess to them the love which I\r\nhave so long kept a secret from them. Ah! how wicked they will think me!\r\nI have been wanting in confidence toward the best of mothers.... My God!\r\ninspire me; give me courage! A criminal dragged before his judges could\r\nnot tremble more than I do!\r\n\r\n\r\nThursday, _October 22d._\r\n\r\nThe prince palatine's confidential chamberlain has already left for\r\nMaleszow. I am very well satisfied with my letter; but the prince royal\r\nfinds fault with it, and says it is too humble; I, in my turn, found his\r\npostscript altogether too royal. I was about to tell him so, when the\r\nprince palatine stopped me.\r\n\r\nWhat will my parents say? Perhaps they will refuse their consent, and,\r\nstrange as it may appear, during the last few days, the sense of my own\r\ndignity has been stronger than my vanity or my desire for greatness.\r\nThis event seems to me quite ordinary: it is true he is the prince\r\nroyal, Duke of Courland, and will perhaps one day be King of Poland, but\r\nif he has not my father's consent, it is he who is not my equal.\r\n\r\nIf no opposition is made to my marriage, I ardently desire that it may\r\nbe the parish priest of Maleszow who will give us the nuptial\r\nbenediction; the prince palatine has promised me to do all he can; at\r\nleast, he will be the representative of my parents, and will confer a\r\nsmall degree of propriety upon the ceremony. Barbara's destiny is ever\r\nin my thoughts! I deemed her wishes very modest when she said to me:\r\n'Strive to be as happy as I am!' Alas! her happiness is immense, when I\r\ncompare it with mine!...\r\n\r\nWednesday, _October 28th._\r\n\r\nMy parents' answer has arrived; they give us their blessing and wish me\r\nmuch happiness; but the tenderness they express toward me is not like\r\nthat obtained and merited by Barbara. This is just; I suffer, but have\r\nno right to complain. The prince royal expected to receive an especial\r\nletter addressed to himself; but my parents have not written to him. He\r\nis piqued, and conversed a long time with the prince palatine on the\r\npride of certain Polish nobles.\r\n\r\nI feel more tranquil since my parents know our secret; my heart is\r\nrelieved from a most cruel torment. My parents promise not to reveal our\r\nmarriage without the prince royal's consent; one may see in their letter\r\nboth joy and surprise; but there is a tone of sadness in my mother's\r\nexpressions which touches me deeply. She says:\r\n\r\n'If you are unhappy, I will not be responsible for it; if you are happy\r\n(and I shall never cease to beg this blessing of God in my prayers), I\r\nwill rejoice, but at the same time regret that I had no part in\r\ncontributing to your felicity'....\r\n\r\nThese words are almost illegible, for I have nearly effaced them with my\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nThe curate from Maleszow will arrive next week, and we will be married\r\nimmediately after. The prince palatine has had the necessary papers\r\nprepared, and no one has any suspicion. I can scarcely believe that my\r\nmarriage is so near.... No preparations will be made for me; all must be\r\nconducted with the greatest secrecy. When Barbara married, she had no\r\nreason to hide herself; all Maleszow was in commotion on her account.\r\n\r\nIf I could only see the prince royal, I should feel consoled. But\r\nsometimes two whole days pass by without any possibility of meeting him.\r\nHe is afraid of exciting the king's suspicions, and still more, those of\r\nBruhl; he avoids me at all public assemblies, and comes less frequently\r\nto the prince palatine's. To all these painful necessities of my\r\nposition must I submit.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening, at Madame Moszynska's _soirée_, I accidentally\r\noverheard a conversation which pained me deeply. A gentleman whom I did\r\nnot know, said to his neighbor: 'But the Starostine Krasinska is\r\nterribly changed!' The answer was: 'That is not at all astonishing, for\r\nthe poor young girl is madly in love with the prince royal, and he is\r\nsomewhat capricious; when he sees a pretty woman, he falls in love with\r\nher immediately, and now he is all devotion to Madame Potocka, and has\r\neyes for no one but her.'\r\n\r\nI am sure the prince pretends to be occupied with other women that he\r\nmay the more readily conceal his real feelings, and yet I shuddered when\r\nI heard this conversation. It is really frightful to be the subject of\r\nsuch improper pleasantries!\r\n\r\nIf I only had a friend in whom I could confide, and whose advice I could\r\nask! My maid is as stupid as an owl, and suspects nothing, but\r\nnotwithstanding, she is to be sent to the interior of Lithuania, and in\r\na few days her place will be supplied by a middle-aged married lady of\r\ngood birth and acknowledged discretion. I have not seen her yet, and I\r\nhave no one to consult with regard to my wedding toilette. For want of a\r\nbetter adviser, I consulted the prince palatine, and he replied: 'Dress\r\nas you do every day.'\r\n\r\nWhat a strange destiny! I am making the most brilliant marriage in the\r\nwhole kingdom, and yet my shoemaker's daughter will have a trousseau and\r\nwedding festivities which I am forced to envy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARSAW, Wednesday, _November 4th, 1760._\r\n\r\nMy destiny is accomplished, and I am the prince royal's wife! We have\r\nsworn before God eternal love and fidelity; he is mine, irrevocably\r\nmine! Ah! how sweet, and yet how cruel was that moment! They were forced\r\nto hurry the ceremony, as we feared discovery.\r\n\r\nI saw nothing of the prince royal during the week preceding my marriage;\r\nhe feigned sickness, and did not leave his room; he has refused to-day\r\ninvitations to dinner at the prince primates, the ambassadors, and even\r\none to the ball given by the grand general of the crown: his supposed\r\nillness was the pretext on which he freed himself from these\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nMy former waiting woman was sent away day before yesterday, and\r\nyesterday came the new one, who has sworn upon the crucifix to be silent\r\nupon all she may see and hear.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock this morning, the prince palatine knocked at my door; I\r\nhad been dressed for at least two hours. We departed as noiselessly as\r\npossible, the prince royal and Prince Martin Lubomirski met us at the\r\npalace gate.... The night was dark, the wind blew, and the cold was\r\nintense. We went on foot to the Carmelite church, because it is the\r\nnearest: our good priest already stood before the altar. If the prince\r\nroyal had not supported me, I should have fallen many times during the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nAnd how sad and melancholy was all within the church! On all sides the\r\nsilence and darkness of the grave! Two wax tapers burned upon the altar,\r\ncasting a dim and uncertain light, while the sound of our own steps was\r\nthe only sign of life heard within the solemn and sombre vault of the\r\ntemple. The ceremony did not last ten minutes, the curate made all\r\npossible haste, and we fled the church as if we had committed some\r\ncrime. The prince royal returned with us: Prince Martin wished him to go\r\nat once to the palace, but he would not leave me, and with great\r\ndifficulty did he at length part from me.\r\n\r\nMy dress was such as I wear every day. I had only dared to place one\r\nlittle branch of rosemary in my hair.... While I was dressing, I thought\r\nof Barbara's wedding, and could not refrain from weeping.... It was not\r\nmy mother who prepared the ducat, the morsel of bread, the salt, and the\r\nsugar, which the betrothed should bear with her on her wedding day; and\r\nso, at the last moment, I forgot them.\r\n\r\nI am now alone in my chamber; not a single friendly eye will say to me:\r\n'Be happy!' My parents have not blessed me.... Profound silence reigns\r\nin every direction, all are yet asleep, and this light burns as if near\r\na corpse.... Ah! my God! what a mournful festival! Were it not for this\r\nfeverish agitation and this wedding ring, which I must soon take off and\r\nhide from every eye, I should believe all these events to be merely a\r\ndream.... But no, I am his, and God has received our vows.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULGOSTOW, Monday, _December 24th._\r\n\r\nI thought when I married that I would no longer have any occasion to\r\nwrite in my journal: I believed that a friend, another me, would be the\r\ndepositary of all my thoughts. I said to myself: 'Why should I write,\r\nwhen I will tell all to the prince royal (it seems to me as if I could\r\ncall him thus during my whole life)? He does not know enough Polish to\r\nread my diary, and consequently it is useless.' But everything separates\r\nme from my well-beloved husband; I will continue to write that I may be\r\nmore closely bound to him, that I may preserve all the remembrances\r\nwhich come to me from him.... I am pursued by a pitiless fate! Ah! what\r\ndespair is at my heart!... When shall I see him again?\r\n\r\nThese last few days have been fearful! I thank Heaven that I am not yet\r\nmad! The princess palatiness has sent me from her house, driven me out\r\nas if I were unworthy to remain.... I have taken refuge with my sister\r\nat Sulgostow: when I arrived, I sent for Barbara and her husband, and\r\nsaid to them: 'Oh, have pity, have pity on me, for I am innocent; I am\r\nthe prince royal's wife!'\r\n\r\nMy poor sister, to whom the whole transaction was a mystery, thought I\r\nhad lost my reason, and was about calling in her maids to aid me. I\r\nendeavored to calm her fears, and to-day I have confided to her all my\r\nsorrows.\r\n\r\nI will try to write down all these recent events. If God ever permits me\r\nto enjoy happiness and tranquillity, I will again read these pages, and\r\nwill better appreciate the value of a quiet felicity.\r\n\r\nSix weeks passed after our marriage, and no one had the least suspicion:\r\nneither the king, the court, nor the watchful society surrounding me,\r\nhad penetrated our secret; all called me as usual, the Starostine\r\nKrasinska. The prince royal, under the pretext of his health, went\r\nnowhere, and the prince palatine managed our interviews. But a week\r\nsince the prince royal began to go out, and paid a visit to my aunt, the\r\nprincess. I was in the saloon when he was announced; it was the first\r\ntime since our marriage that I had seen him in presence of a third\r\nperson, and I found it impossible to hide my confusion. I could not see\r\nand hear him without telling him through my eyes that I loved him.\r\n\r\nThe princess observed me. When he was gone, she scolded me, and\r\nreproached me with what she called my coquetry and imprudence; I could\r\nnot bear her injustice, and very rashly replied, that no one had a right\r\nto blame me when my own conscience absolved me. The prince royal came\r\nagain the next day; the princess was abstracted, and a dissatisfaction,\r\nwhich she strove in vain to disguise, appeared in her whole manner. He\r\nwas entirely occupied with me, and did not perceive the storm which was\r\ngathering; not having been able to speak with me alone on that day, he\r\nhad written to me, and while pretending to play with my work basket, he\r\nslipped a note into it. The princess saw it, and as soon as he had gone,\r\nseized upon the fatal note, which was addressed to: 'My well beloved.'\r\n\r\nI can never describe her anger and indignation. How did I ever live\r\nthrough that horrible scene!...\r\n\r\n'Your _intrigues_,' she cried, 'will never succeed in my house; you are\r\nthe horror, the shame, and the ignominy of your family, and you shall\r\nnot disgrace my mansion. I have already taken measures to put an end to\r\nyour infamous conduct; here is a copy of the letter sent by me this\r\nmorning to the minister, Bruhl. I tell him that honor is dearer and more\r\nsacred to me than all family ties, that an ambitious hope will never\r\ninduce me to renounce the duties which it imposes upon me, and that I\r\nnow esteem it my duty to inform him that the prince royal loves Frances\r\nKrasinska. I conjure the minister to do all in his power to end this\r\nintrigue while there is yet time. I will prove that I have nothing to do\r\nwith this abomination, and that if I have been in fault, it was because\r\nI placed such implicit confidence in my niece's virtue. Yes--the king\r\nhimself, at this very moment, probably knows the whole extent of your\r\nshame and your insane pride.'\r\n\r\n'The king!' I cried, almost out of my senses, 'the king! Ah! Let no one\r\ntell him that I am the prince royal's wife; let no one tell him that, or\r\nI shall die at your feet!'\r\n\r\nLost to all memory, all sense, except that of the fearful abyss just\r\nopened before me, I thus confessed the secret which no personal\r\ninvective or humiliation could have drawn from me.\r\n\r\n'How?' she replied, 'the wife of the prince royal! You! his wife!'\r\n\r\nThis word recalled me to myself, and led me to comprehend the enormity\r\nof my fault. I shuddered when I thought of the prince's anger, and I saw\r\nbut one chance for safety, and that was by confessing all to the\r\nprincess.\r\n\r\nI fell at her feet, imploring, her to forgive the past, and keep our\r\nsecret. Whether she was offended by the tardiness of my confession, or\r\nwhether she thought she had gone too far to retrace her steps, I know\r\nnot, but she remained implacable, and with cold and repulsive dignity\r\ncommanded me to rise, saying:\r\n\r\n'So great a lady should never be found at any one's feet, and I offer\r\nyou a thousand apologies for my conduct toward you.'\r\n\r\nI attempted to kiss her hand, but she withdrew it, and ended by saying\r\nthat her house was unworthy of a lady of my quality, of a princess\r\nroyal, of an independent duchess, of the future Queen of Poland. She\r\nthen made all the preparations necessary for my departure.\r\n\r\nI retained strength enough to control my feelings, for which I thank\r\nGod: a momentary flash of anger did not cause me to forget so many\r\nproofs of kindness and affection, and, with the docility of a girl of\r\nsixteen, I prepared to depart, although I was entirely ignorant where I\r\nshould go to, or who would offer me protection and an asylum.... I\r\nbelieve the word _Sulgostow_ was uttered either by myself or by the\r\nprincess. The valet who came to take the princess's orders during the\r\nlatter part of our conversation, mentioned throughout the mansion that I\r\nwas going to Sulgostow to pass the Christmas holidays.\r\n\r\nChance decided my fate, and, incapable of forming any resolution, I was\r\nhappy in permitting myself to be guided by others. Before I left, I\r\nwrote a long letter to the prince royal, which I confided to the\r\nprincess. In less than two hours all my arrangements were made; I came\r\nand went, I acted mechanically, without fixed thought or purpose; I was\r\nfinally placed in the carriage with my lady companion, and the horses\r\nbore us rapidly away from Warsaw.\r\n\r\nWhen I beheld the walls of Sulgostow, I began to think upon how I could\r\nbest acquaint my sister with these incredible events; but once in her\r\npresence, my confusion was such that I lost the power of measuring my\r\nwords, and hence she fancied I had gone mad....\r\n\r\nNow that all has been explained, we laugh together over this strange\r\nmistake, but such laughter is only a momentary forgetfulness of my\r\nposition, and a passing truce to my torment. These first two days have\r\nbeen most painful, for I have as yet heard nothing from the prince\r\nroyal. I cannot express my grief and my anguish; my health must be very\r\nstrong not to have suffered more from such torments.... At least, may I\r\nnot hope that my dreams of bliss will one day be realized?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT STRUGGLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it true that 'our democratic institutions are now on trial?'\r\nEverybody, or nearly everybody, says so. _The London Times_ says so, and\r\nis or has been gloating over their failure. Many of our 'able editors'\r\nsay so, and are trying desperately to prove that they will not fail.\r\nThus, while there is a wide difference in opinion as to what may be the\r\nresult, there seems to be a quite general agreement as to the fact that\r\nthe trial is going on. There appears to be no suspicion that the\r\nquestion is not properly stated. Doubtless the assertion will excite\r\nsurprise, if heeded at all, that in fact the great struggle here and now\r\nis _not_ between aristocracy or despotism on the one hand, and democracy\r\non the other. Most people in the United States have come to entertain\r\nthe fixed idea that the only natural political antagonisms are\r\ndemocratic as opposed to despotic in any and all shapes. And this idea\r\nhas become so ingrained in the American mind that it will be difficult\r\nto gain credence for the assertion that the terms constitutionalism and\r\nabsolutism represent the forces or systems which, have really been\r\nantagonistic ever since Christianity began to affect and animate social\r\nand political relations.\r\n\r\nIt may be a new idea to many readers that absolutism can be democratic,\r\nas well as aristocratic or autocratic. Yet such is the fact, and the\r\nwhole history of Greece and Rome proves it. Plato, the friend of the\r\npeople, taught the absolute power of the state--of the power holder,\r\nwhoever that might be, whether the people, the aristocracy, the\r\ntriumvirate, the archon, or the consul. It was not possible for Plato,\r\nDemosthenes, or Cicero, to conceive the idea of constitutionalism.\r\n\r\nWherever the will of the power holder operates _directly_ upon the\r\nsubject or object, there is absolutism. Interpose a _medium_ between the\r\ntwo, separate the law _maker_ from the law _executor_, make _both_ the\r\nsubjects or servants of the law, and then, if the people are virtuous,\r\nyou can harmonize private liberty with public order. The individual must\r\nnot be absorbed by the state; individual liberty must not be merged in\r\nabsolutism. Nor must the state go down before individualism.\r\n\r\nThe problem is to render possible and reconcile the coexistence of the\r\nlargest private liberty and the highest public authority. This implies\r\nthe idea of _mediation_. There must be _mediatizing_ institutions\r\nstanding between the state and the individual, insuring the safe\r\ntransmission of power, and guaranteeing justice between the state and\r\nindividuals, as well as between individuals in their relations with each\r\nother. This done, you realize or actualize the grand idea of mediation\r\nin the political relations of men. The distinguishing idea of\r\nChristianity--the God-man reconciling man with God, and thus harmonizing\r\nthe finite with the infinite--this idea must actualize itself in the\r\naffairs of men, in order to harmonize perfect liberty with salutary\r\nauthority. Animated by this idea, penetrated with profoundest belief of\r\nthe infinite worth of the individual man because the God-man had\r\nwonderfully renewed his nature, the early Christian heroes and martyrs\r\ntook hold of the hostile and disorganized elements of European\r\nsociety--the fragments of the Roman empire on the one hand, and the\r\nbarbarians of the north on the other--and brought order out of chaos.\r\nThey re-organized society by naturally, though slowly, developing those\r\nnumerous intermediary institutions--guilds, corporations, trial by jury,\r\nthe judiciary, and representation of interests, orders, guilds and\r\ncorporations, _not of individual heads_, in Parliament--all which, as a\r\nliving, harmonious system, constitute, or _did_ constitute, the English\r\nConstitution, and were essentially reproduced in the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, and which wonderfully distinguish constitutionalism from\r\nabsolutism.\r\n\r\n'The will of the emperor has the force of law,' was the fundamental\r\nmaxim of the civil law. Emperor, imperator;--hence, imperialism,\r\nCæsarism, absolutism. That maxim obtained with pagans--civilized it may\r\nbe, but none the less pagans--whose theory or gospel was that 'man is\r\nhis own end.' Man's infinite moral worth as man, was not known or not\r\nrecognized in the pagan civilization of the classic Greeks and Romans.\r\nHence the state, which outlived the individual, was of more importance\r\nthan the individual, and naturally absorbed the individual. Man being\r\nhis own end, and existence being next to impossible without society, the\r\nstate was the best means to obtain his end, and therefore Plato taught\r\nthat man lives for the state, must be trained up for the state, belongs\r\nto the state, and is of no value outside of the state. Hence the pagan\r\ncivilization of Greece and Rome, being intensely human, while it became\r\nvery splendid and refined, became also, and could not help becoming\r\nintensely and unutterably corrupt--so corrupt that St. Paul refrained\r\nfrom finishing the disgusting catalogue of its awful sins and vices. The\r\nchurch, Christianity, could save _man_, but it could not save the\r\n_empire_. The principle of social harmony being lost, government and\r\nsociety fell to pieces.\r\n\r\nOn a certain memorable occasion, the present Emperor of France uttered\r\nthe mystic phrase: _The empire is peace!_ So it is. But how? I answer:\r\nSeveral centuries of Godless French statesmanship--engineered by men\r\nwho, though nominal Christians or Catholics, discarded God in affairs of\r\nstate, and attempted to rule without God in the world, except to use Him\r\n(pardon the expression) as a sort of scarecrow for the 'lower\r\norders'--resulted in gradually drying up those intermediary institutions\r\nwhich had served at once to develop a manly civic life and to protect\r\nprivate liberty, and in reabsorbing and concentrating all power in the\r\ncentral government. Even in the early part of these centuries, Louis the\r\nFourteenth made his boast, 'I am the state,' and thereby announced the\r\nsubstantial reinauguration of pagan imperialism or absolutism. His\r\nsuccessors, aided by the ever-growing influence of the renaissance,\r\nwhich was but the revivification of classic paganism, continued his\r\nsystem, and when at last their cruel, inhuman, and unchristian\r\noppressions drove men to the assertion of their rights in the fierce\r\nwhirlwind of the French Revolution, that very assertion, 'clad in hell\r\nfire,' as Carlyle says, was based on the self-same fundamental principle\r\nthat 'man is his own end.' The Revolution also ignored the divine idea,\r\nand failed. The subsequent revolutions, and especially that of 1848,\r\nwere no wiser. The last was simply the triumph of democratic absolutism\r\nby universal suffrage, in place of autocratic or monarchic absolutism,\r\nas De Tocqueville clearly demonstrated in his 'Ancient Regime and the\r\nRevolution.' De Tocqueville had thoroughly mastered the constitutional\r\nsystem, as had also Lacordaire and Montalembert, and he, as well as\r\nthey, joined the so-called republican movement of 1848, hoping that\r\nconstitutionalism would triumph at last. But he soon saw that European\r\nDemocrats or Red Republicans did not comprehend the idea;--that, in\r\nfact, they meant absolutism, though democratic; and he retired in\r\ndisappointment, though calm hopefulness, to his estate, and there wrote\r\nhis 'Ancient Regime.'\r\n\r\nTrue, the Red Republicans issued high-sounding phrases about liberty,\r\nrights of man, and the right of the people to govern. But they meant\r\nrights of man independent of God, and the right of the people to be\r\nabsolute; and they continued the system of centralism, or government by\r\nbureaucracy, without God. The French have learned by sad experience that\r\nthere is a thousand times more danger of change, turbulence, and\r\ndisruption, under democratic absolutism than under autocratic\r\nabsolutism. Louis Napoleon knows it well, and hence his significant\r\nphrase, 'The empire is peace.' It is the strong iron band around a mass\r\nof antagonistic atoms, which have lost, at least in the sphere of\r\npolitics, the cohesive principle of harmony: union with each other by\r\nvirtue of union with the God-man.\r\n\r\nThrough all the terrific scenes of turbulence and carnage, the frequent\r\ndynastic changes, and the fearful scourgings of the French empire since\r\nthe days of Louis the Fourteenth, the nation itself has not been\r\ndestroyed, because, after all, there was and is a vast deal of virtue in\r\nthe people as individuals. God never destroyed a nation for its public\r\nor national sins until the people themselves had become individually\r\nthoroughly corrupt. The city of Sodom itself would have been spared had\r\neven _five_ good men been found therein. And so the French nation does\r\nnot go to pieces, as the Roman empire did, because, notwithstanding the\r\nvice of Paris, of which we hear and read so much, and the godlessness of\r\nFrench statesmanship and French literature, the great body of the\r\npeople, even in Paris, still retain their integrity, and a wholesome\r\nfear of God. But because their current literature is heathenish, and\r\ntheir statesmanship has ignored honesty and the divine origin of man's\r\nrights, those intermediary institutions, which were developed by\r\nChristian charity from the idea that man's rights are sacred because\r\nGod-given and dignified by the God-man, have been undermined or\r\ndisanimated, and it has come to pass that the only government possible,\r\nwhere the divine idea is eliminated from politics, is one in the form of\r\nabsolutism. How long this form will continue in France remains to be\r\nseen. But it is certain that European Democrats or Red Republicans, with\r\ntheir ideas--or rather lack of ideas--will never comprehend the\r\nconstitutional system, and will never rehabilitate or reanimate those\r\nintermediary municipal institutions, the monuments of which De\r\nTocqueville was surprised to find scattered so generally through\r\ncontinental Europe, as well as in England and in New England.\r\n\r\nTurning, now, to the United States, it is plainly evident that the whole\r\ntendency of our politics, intensely accelerated by the influence of\r\nJefferson's French views, has been, first, to lose out of mind the true\r\nsignificance of those intermediary institutions embodied in the common\r\nlaw of England, and inherited by us from the mother country; and,\r\nsecondly, to depreciate them as standing in the way of the people's\r\nwill, or popular sovereignty; and, lastly, to break them down entirely,\r\nand substitute for them the tyranny of an irresponsible majority, or\r\ndemocratic absolutism. The persistent efforts to get rid of grand juries\r\nand trial by jury, to popularize the judiciary, to make senatorial terms\r\ndependent on changing party majorities, to reduce the representative to\r\na mere deputy, and other similar schemes to bring about the direct\r\n_unmediatized_ operation of the popular will upon the subject, are all\r\nillustrations of this direful tendency.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with, and greatly aiding this tendency, there has been a\r\ngradual decay of the manly virtue that charactized our fathers. Men have\r\nbecome less conscientious in the performance of their public duties, and\r\nmore regardless of private rights. A genuine manly self-respect implies\r\nsincere respect for the rights of others, and both inevitably decay as\r\nthe fear of God dies out. When men continually act on the idea that man\r\nis his own end, and when each one is intensely engaged in seeking his\r\nown interest, what can result but jarring of interests, opposition,\r\nrepulsion, disregard of law in so far as it clashes with private ends,\r\nand thus, finally, social and political disruption more or less\r\nextensive? Thus our trouble lies deeper than slavery. Remove the canker\r\nof slavery to-day, and yet the tendency to disruption and dissolution\r\nwould evermore go on while prevailing ideas actuated society. The\r\nremorseless mill of selfishness would keep on grinding, grinding,\r\ngrinding toward dissolution. Look at our literature, our architecture,\r\nour science, our political and moral theories, our social arrangements\r\ngenerally, and especially our hideous, almost diabolical arrangements or\r\nlack of arrangements for the care of the poor and the unfortunate, and\r\nwhat a confused jumble they present! Having no grand animating idea, no\r\nall-pervading principle of harmony, no universally recognized standard\r\nfor anything, we are necessarily the most anomalous, amorphous,\r\nhelter-skelter aggregation of independent and antagonistic\r\nindividualities ever gathered together since nations began to exist.\r\nWhat can prevent such an agglomeration from falling to pieces? What can\r\nhold it together?\r\n\r\nThus, with the frightful decay of Christian, and even manly\r\nvirtue--alas! too plainly visible all around us--and the entire\r\ndivorcement of morality or religious ideas from politics, what fate is\r\nin store for us but the inevitable triumph of anarchy, and through it of\r\ndespotism? Herein lies our real danger. The great struggle is _not_, as\r\nmany assert, between aristocracy, or monarchy, or despotism and\r\ndemocracy. But it is between despotism or absolutism and\r\nconstitutionalism. It is the struggle of the pagan system (revived by\r\nthe renaissance), based on the idea that 'man is his own end,' with the\r\nChristian system based on the idea of mediation, involving the idea that\r\nthe true end of man is God. It is not true, therefore, that democratic\r\ninstitutions are now on trial in the United States. Democracy, pure and\r\nsimple, precisely in the form it is assuming or has assumed in this\r\ncountry, was tried long ago. It was tried in ancient Greece, and found\r\nwanting. It was tried in Rome, and ended in the dissolution of the\r\nempire. And in both these trials it had, to begin with, a much more\r\nhighly finished, fresh, robust, and whole-souled manhood to work with\r\nand to work upon than that of modern democracy. More recently it was\r\ntried in France, and for the present is blooming in the despotism of\r\nNapoleon III.\r\n\r\nThe question, then, I repeat, is whether constitutionalism, as\r\noriginally developed in England and embodied and reproduced by our\r\nfathers--who, perhaps, 'builded wiser than they knew'--can come safely\r\nthrough this crisis and triumph over the two ideas which, thus far, have\r\npredominated in the American mind, and driven us with fearful strides\r\ntoward absolutism. 'Every man for himself' is the first idea. In the\r\nfamily, in church, in politics, in commerce, in all social and political\r\nrelations, every man striving, pushing, scrambling, straining every\r\nnerve to advance himself, regardless of his neighbor or the public\r\ninterest--such everywhere is the confused and hideous picture of\r\nAmerican society. Selfishness predominates, and selfishness is\r\nrepellant. So it was before the ages were, when Lucifer, in the pride of\r\nself, refused obedience to the Word. So it is even yet, and its\r\ninevitable tendency is to hostile isolation and final dissolution. Its\r\nlogical consequence is anarchy. But anarchy is intolerable, and a\r\ncivilized people, yea, even barbarians, will submit to anything rather\r\nthan social and political chaos. Then comes the iron band of despotism\r\nto hold together the antagonistic fragments.\r\n\r\n'The supremacy of the people's will' is the second idea. _Vox Populi,\r\nvox Dei!_ What the people decree is right, and nothing must stand\r\nbetween their will and the subject or object upon which it operates!\r\nSuch is the political gospel according to democracy, and fifty years'\r\nearnest proclamation thereof has wellnigh abolished all the barriers of\r\nconstitutionalism--barriers, which stood like faithful guardians, stern\r\nbut just, between the Individual and the State, which reconciled the\r\nharmonious coexistence of private liberty and public power--an idea\r\nwholly unknown in pagan or classic civilization--and which at once\r\nprevented the anarchy of individualism and the tyranny of absolutism.\r\nBut true it is, whatever a people constantly assert they come to\r\nbelieve, and whatever they believe will at last crystallize itself in\r\naction. And thus, with the oft-repeated and ever-increasing assertion\r\nthat 'man is his own end,' and 'is sufficient unto himself,' and with\r\nthat other assertion that the will of the people is law and must act\r\ndirectly upon its object, we have gradually lost out of mind the true\r\nsignificance of the constitutional system. Those numberless intermediary\r\ninstitutions--which logically _grew_ out of the Christian idea of\r\nmediation, as the oak naturally grows out of the acorn, and which\r\nwonderfully reconciled liberty with authority, freedom with order, the\r\nfinite with the infinite--have become more and more obsolete, and less\r\nand less understood. They have crumbled away like the stately columns of\r\na magnificent but neglected cathedral. They have become dead branches\r\nthat must be lopped off. They are rubbish that must be removed--relics\r\nof monarchy or aristocracy, cunningly devised inventions of priestcraft\r\nor kingcraft, that retard the triumph of democracy.\r\n\r\nIf the will of the people is supreme, then away with your high and\r\nlife-long judges, or at least let them be elected by the people and for\r\nvery brief terms. Let grand juries be voted a humbug, and trial by jury\r\na nuisance. Let electoral colleges be abolished as meaningless and\r\ncumbersome anomalies. Let the President be the direct representative of\r\na mighty people, and act without let or hindrance--only let him act with\r\ngigantic energy and swift execution. Let senatorial terms be dependent\r\nupon changing legislative majorities. In fact, let the two legislative\r\nhouses, as being wholly useless and very expensive, be reduced to one.\r\nLet the representative be a tongue-bound deputy, and not a free, manly,\r\nself-acting agent. Let county boards of supervisors give way to the one\r\nman power of the county judge. And, in short, let us go on, as we have\r\nbeen going on, democratizing or popularising our institutions,\r\n'improving,' or rather impairing and tearing down one after another of\r\nthe venerable columns of the original system, until every safeguard of\r\npersonal freedom is removed, and there shall be nothing left to restrain\r\nthe giant sway of unmitigated and unmediatized public power. Then we\r\nshall have despotism or absolutism, pure and simple--and none the less\r\nso because it shall be democratic.\r\n\r\nThe London _Times_ will have nothing to jubilate over if what it\r\nmistakenly calls our 'trial of democratic institutions' shall be\r\nunsuccessful. For in fact, our constitutional system was but the\r\nreproduction, in a broader field and on a grander scale, of the British\r\nConstitution, in all its essential features, differing only in what\r\nphilosophic historians call 'accidentals.' And if that system finally\r\nfails here, _The Times_ may have a 'most comfortable assurance' that it\r\nwill fail in England. True, we have more rapidly departed from and\r\ndefaced that system than the English, chiefly because, in escaping from\r\nthe fogs of England, we left behind us that stolid conservatism, that\r\nbulldog tenacity for the old because it is old, which are instinctive in\r\nthe narrow-minded islanders. But they, just as much as we, have lost out\r\nof mind the significance of the Christian idea. They, just as much as\r\nwe, have become thoroughly paganized--have become saturated with the\r\ncentral idea of pagan civilization, that man is his own end, lives for\r\nhimself alone, and not for God, and therefore is inferior to and must be\r\nthe mere tool of the state. If Americans hold that the state can _make_\r\nright, as well as enforce it, so do the English. If divine sanctions\r\nhave no longer any significance in America, so have they not in England.\r\nIf expediency, and not God's truth, is the universal rule of action\r\nhere, so is it there. If every American or 'Yankee' seeks his own end in\r\nhis own way, regardless of his neighbor, his Government, and his God, so\r\ndoes every Englishman. The Englishman has no God except his belly or his\r\npurse. Years ago it was said by one of themselves, 'The hell of the\r\nEnglish is--_not to make money_,' If the divine principle of charity is\r\na myth, and selfishness rages against selfishness here, much more so\r\nwith a people whose only God is Mammon. And finally, if inevitable\r\ndissolution shall overtake us, and we rush into absolutism as a refuge\r\nfrom anarchy, we shall have the melancholy pleasure--if it can be a\r\npleasure--of hailing the almost simultaneous wreck of the British\r\nConstitution, whose noble ruins, no less than ours, would be mournful\r\nmonumental witnesses to the glory of ages wiser and better than our\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FINANCES AND RESOURCES.\r\n\r\nLETTER NO. II, FROM HON. ROBERT J. WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONDON, _10 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly_,\r\n  October 8, 1863.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the people of the United Kingdom and of the\r\nUnited States are mainly of the same race, speak the same language, have\r\nthe same literature, ancestry, and common law, with the same history for\r\ncenturies, and a reciprocal commerce exceeding that of all the rest of\r\nthe world, it is amazing how little is known in each country of the\r\nother. This condition of affairs is most unfavorable to the continuance\r\nof peace and good will between two great and kindred nations. It causes\r\nconstant misapprehension by each party of the acts and motives of the\r\nother, arrests the development of friendly feeling, and retards the\r\nadvance of commercial freedom. It excites almost daily rumors of\r\nimpending war, disturbing the course of trade, causing large mercantile\r\nlosses, and great unnecessary Government expenditures. If war has not\r\nensued, it has led to angry controversy and bitter recrimination. It is\r\nsowing broadcast in both countries the seeds of international hatred,\r\nrendering England and America two hostile camps, frowning mutual\r\ndefiance; and, if not terminating in war, must, if not arrested, end in\r\nembargoes and non-intercourse, or discriminating duties on imports and\r\ntonnage, greatly injurious to both countries. I know it has become\r\nfashionable in England and America to sneer at the fact of our common\r\norigin; but the great truth still exists, and is fraught with momentous\r\nconsequences, for good or evil, to both nations, and to mankind. The\r\nUnited States were colonized mainly by the people of England. Ten of our\r\noriginal thirteen States bear English names, as do also nearly all their\r\ncounties, townships, cities, and villages.\r\n\r\nLeaving to Englishmen the task of disabusing the Americans in regard to\r\ntheir own country, I will endeavor to present, in a condensed form, some\r\nmaterial and authentic facts as regards the United States, for the\r\nconsideration of the people of the United Kingdom. I read and hear every\r\nday here predictions of our impending bankruptcy and national\r\ndissolution; our wealth and resources depreciated; our cause, our\r\npeople, our armies, and Government decried; and a war in words and in\r\nthe press prosecuted against us with vindictive fury. All this hostility\r\nis fully reciprocated in America; and if the war is not confined to\r\nwords and types, it will not be the fault of agitators in both\r\ncountries. So far as an American can, even in part, arrest this fatal\r\nprogress of misapprehension, by communicating information in regard to\r\nhis own country, is the principal purpose of these essays.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the daily predictions here of our impending ruin and\r\nnational bankruptcy, I shall first discuss the question of our wealth,\r\nresources, and material progress.\r\n\r\nAREA.--The area of the United States, including lakes and\r\nrivers, is 3,250,000 square miles, being larger than all Europe. (Rep.\r\nSec. of Interior and of Com. of Gen. Land Office for Dec. 1860, p. 13.)\r\n\r\nOur land surface is 3,010,370 square miles, being 1,926,636,000 acres.\r\nThis area is compact and contiguous, divided into States and\r\nTerritories, united by lakes, rivers, canals, and railroads. We have no\r\ncolonies. Congress governs the nation by what the Constitution declares\r\nto be '_the supreme law_,' whilst local regulations are prescribed and\r\nadministered by the several States and Territories. We front on the two\r\ngreat oceans--the Atlantic and Pacific; extending from the St. Lawrence\r\nand the lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, from near the 24th to the 49th\r\nparallel of north latitude; and in longitude, from 67° 25' to 124° 40'\r\nwest of Greenwich. Our location on the globe as regards its land surface\r\nis central, and all within the temperate zone. No empire of contiguous\r\nterritory possesses such a variety of climate, soil, forests and\r\nprairies, fruits and fisheries, animal, vegetable, mineral, and\r\nagricultural products. We have all those of Europe, with many in\r\naddition, and a climate (on the average) more salubrious, and with\r\ngreater longevity, as shown by the international census. We have a far\r\nmore fertile soil and genial sun, with longer and better seasons for\r\ncrops and stock; and already, in our infancy, with our vast products,\r\nfeed and clothe many millions in Europe and other continents. Last year\r\nour exports to foreign countries of breadstuffs and provisions, from the\r\nloyal States alone, were of the value of $108,000,000. (Table of Com.\r\nand Nav. 1860.)\r\n\r\nIf as well cultivated as England, our country could much more than feed\r\nand clothe the whole population of the world. If as densely settled as\r\nEngland, our population would be more than twelve hundred millions,\r\nexceeding that of all the earth. If as densely settled as Massachusetts\r\n(among the least fertile of all our States), we would number 513,000,000\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that our area exceeds that of Europe, with a far more\r\ngenial sun and fertile soil, and capable of yielding more than double\r\nthe amount of agricultural products and of sustaining more than twice\r\nthe number of inhabitants. We have a greater extent of mines than all\r\nEurope, especially of coal, iron, gold, silver, and quicksilver. Our\r\ncoal alone, as stated by Sir William Armstrong (the highest British\r\nauthority), is 32 times as great as that of the United Kingdom, and our\r\niron will bear a similar proportion.\r\n\r\nOur maritime front is 5,120 miles; but our whole coast line, including\r\nbays, sounds, and rivers, up to the head of tide water, is 33,663 miles.\r\n(Ex. Doc. No. 7, pp. 75, 76, Official Report of Professor A. D. Bache,\r\nSuperintendent of U. S. Coast Survey, Dec. 5th, 1848.) Our own lake\r\nshore line is 3,620 miles. (Top. Rep. ib. 77.)\r\n\r\nThe shore line of the Mississippi river above tide water and its\r\ntributaries, is 35,644 (ib. 77); and of all our other rivers, above tide\r\nwater, is 49,857 miles, making in all 122,784 miles. Of this stupendous\r\nwater mileage, more than one half is navigable by steam, employing an\r\ninterior steam tonnage exceeding that of all the internal steam tonnage\r\nof the rest of the world. No country is arterialized by such a vast\r\nsystem of navigable streams, to have constructed which as canals of\r\nequal capacity would have cost more than ten billions of dollars, and\r\nthen these canals would have been subjected to large tolls, the cost of\r\ntheir annual repairs would have been enormous, and the interruption by\r\nlockage a serious obstacle. We may rest assured then, that, all Europe\r\ncombined, can never have such facilities for cheap water communication\r\nas the United States. This is a mighty element in estimating the power\r\nand progress of a nation. It shows, also, why we have no such deserts as\r\nSahara, so small a portion of our lands requiring manures or irrigation,\r\nand no general failures of crops, with so few even partial failures of\r\nany one crop.\r\n\r\nWe have more deep, capacious, and safe harbors, accessible at _all\r\ntides_, than all Europe, with more than twenty capable of receiving the\r\n_Great Eastern_. (Charts, U. S. Coast Survey.)\r\n\r\nOur hydraulic power (including Niagara) far exceeds that of all Europe.\r\nWe have more timber than all Europe, including most varieties, useful\r\nand ornamental. We have, including cotton, vastly more of the raw\r\nmaterial for manufactures than all Europe. With all these vast natural\r\nadvantages, has man, in our country, performed his duty, in availing\r\nhimself of the bounteous gifts of Providence? We are considering now the\r\nquestion of our material progress, in regard to which, the following\r\nofficial data are presented.\r\n\r\nWe have completed since 1790, 5,782 miles of canals, from 4 to 10 feet\r\ndeep, and from 40 to 75 feet wide, costing $148,000,000, and mostly\r\nnavigable by steam. (Census Table, 1860, No. 39.)\r\n\r\nWe have constructed since 1829, 33,698 miles of railroad (more than all\r\nthe rest of the world), costing $1,258,922,729. (Table 38, Census of\r\n1860, and Addenda.)\r\n\r\nWe have in operation on the land, more miles of telegraph than all the\r\nworld, a single route, from New York to San Francisco, being 3,500\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nOur lighthouses exceed in number those of any other country, and we have\r\nno light-dues, as in England.\r\n\r\nOur coast survey, executed by Professor Bache, Superintendent of the U.\r\nS. Coast Survey, exceeds in extent and accuracy that of any other\r\ncountry. On this subject, we have the united opinions of British and\r\nContinental savans.\r\n\r\nWe have made since 1790, 1,505,454 linear miles of survey of the public\r\nlands of the United States, belonging to the Government, including\r\n460,000,000 of acres already divided into townships, each six miles\r\nsquare (23,040 acres), subdivided into square miles, called sections, of\r\n640 acres each, and each section further subdivided into 16 lots of 40\r\nacres each.\r\n\r\nTONNAGE.--The total tonnage of the United States was in--\r\n\r\n        1814,      1,368,127 tons.\r\n  June, 1851,      3,772,439  \"\r\n  June, 1861,      5,539,812  \"\r\n\r\nAt the same rate of increase as from 1851 to 1861, our tonnage would be,\r\nin\r\n\r\n  1871,        8,134,578 tons.\r\n  1881,       11,952,817  \"\r\n  1891,       17,541,514  \"\r\n  1901,       25,758,948  \"\r\n       (_Table of Com. and Nav._)\r\n\r\nAt the close of this century our tonnage then, at this rate of increase,\r\nwould far exceed that of all the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nGOLD AND SILVER.--The aggregate product of our gold and silver\r\nmines approaches now _one billion of dollars_, most of which has been\r\nconverted into coin at our mint. Nearly all of this product has been\r\nobtained since the discovery of gold in California. Less than two per\r\ncent. of the precious metals has been the product of the seceded States.\r\nThis gold and silver are found now in seven States, and nine\r\nTerritories; the yield is rapidly augmenting, and new discoveries\r\nconstantly developed.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior estimates the total product 'next year,'\r\nof our mines of precious metals, at '$100,000,000,' and when our\r\nrailroad to the Pacific (traversing this region) is completed, his\r\nestimate of the 'annual yield' is '$150,000,000.' The mines are declared\r\n'inexhaustible' by the highest authority, and our Nevada silver mines\r\nare now admitted to be 'the richest in the world.' The completion of our\r\nimperial railroad, now progressing to the Pacific, will carry an immense\r\npopulation to the gold and silver regions, vastly increase the number of\r\nminers, diminish the cost of mining, and decrease the price of\r\nprovisions and supplies to the laborers. When we add to this, the vast\r\nand increasing product of our quicksilver mines of California, so\r\nindispensable as an amalgam in producing gold and silver, as also the\r\ngreat and progressive improvement in processes and machinery for working\r\nthe quartz veins, it is now believed that the estimates of our Secretary\r\nof the Interior, and Commissioner of the General Land Office, will be\r\nexceeded by the result. These mines of the precious metals are nearly\r\nall on the public lands of the United States; they are the _property of\r\nthe Federal Government_, and their intrinsic value _exceeds our public\r\ndebt_.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC LANDS.--The United States own an immense public domain,\r\nacquired by treaties with France, Spain, and Mexico, and by compacts\r\nwith States and Indian tribes. This domain is thus described in the\r\nReport of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, of November 29th,\r\n1860:\r\n\r\n     'Of the 3,250,000 of square miles which constitute the territorial\r\n     extent of the Union, the public lands embrace an area of 2,265,625\r\n     square miles, or 1,450,000,000 of acres, being more than two thirds\r\n     of our geographical extent, and nearly three times as large as the\r\n     United States at the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace\r\n     in 1783 with Great Britain. This empire domain extends from the\r\n     northern line of Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, reaching to the\r\n     Atlantic Ocean, northwesterly to the Canada line bordering upon the\r\n     great Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior, extending westward\r\n     to the Pacific Ocean, with Puget's Sound on the north, the\r\n     Mediterranean Sea of our extreme northwestern possessions.\r\n\r\n     'It includes fifteen sovereignties, known as the 'Land States,' and\r\n     an extent of territory sufficient for thirty-two additional, each\r\n     equal to the great central land State of Ohio.\r\n\r\n     'It embraces soils capable of abundant yield of the rich\r\n     productions of the tropics, of sugar, cotton, rice, tobacco, corn,\r\n     and the grape, the vintage, now a staple, particularly so of\r\n     California; of the great cereals, wheat and corn, in the Western,\r\n     Northwestern, and Pacific States, and in that vast interior region\r\n     from the valley of the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains;\r\n     and thence to the chain formed by the Sierra Nevada and Cascades,\r\n     the eastern wall of the Pacific slope, every variety of soil is\r\n     found revealing its wealth.\r\n\r\n     'Instead of dreary, inarable wastes, as supposed in earlier times,\r\n     the millions of buffalo, elk, deer, mountain sheep, the primitive\r\n     inhabitants of the soil, fed by the hand of nature, attest its\r\n     capacity for the abundant support of a dense population through the\r\n     skilful toil of the agriculturist, dealing with the earth under the\r\n     guidance of the science of the present age.\r\n\r\n     'Not only is the yield of food for man in this region abundant, but\r\n     it holds in its bosom the precious metals of gold, silver, with\r\n     cinnabar, the useful metals of iron, lead, copper, interspersed\r\n     with immense belts or strata of that propulsive element, coal, the\r\n     source of riches and power, and now the indispensable agent, not\r\n     only for domestic purposes of life, but in the machine shop, the\r\n     steam car, and steam vessel, quickening the advance of civilization\r\n     and the permanent settlement of the country, and being the agent of\r\n     active and constant intercommunication with every part of the\r\n     republic.'\r\n\r\nKansas having been admitted since the date of this Report, our public\r\ndomain, thus described officially, now includes the sixteen _land\r\nStates_, and _all_ the Territories.\r\n\r\nOf this vast region (originally 1,450,000,000 acres), there was surveyed\r\nup to September, 1860, 441,067,915 acres, and 394,088,712 acres disposed\r\nof by sales, grants, etc., leaving, as the Commissioner states, 'the\r\ntotal area of unsold and unappropriated, of offered and unoffered lands\r\nof the public domain, 1,055,911,288 acres.' This is 'land surface,'\r\nexclusive of lakes, bays, rivers, etc., 1,055,911,288 acres, or\r\n1,649,861 square miles, and exceeds one half the area of the whole\r\nUnion. The area of New York, being 47,000 square miles, is less than a\r\nthirty-fifth part of our public domain. England[3] (proper) has 50,922\r\nsquare miles, France 203,736, Prussia 107,921, and Germany 80,620 square\r\nmiles. The area then of our public domain is more than eight times as\r\nlarge as France, more than fifteen times as large as Prussia, more than\r\ntwenty times as large as Germany, more than thirty-two times as large as\r\nEngland, and larger (excluding Russia) than all Europe, containing more\r\nthan 200 millions of people.\r\n\r\nAs England (proper) contained in 1861, 18,949,916 inhabitants, if our\r\npublic domain were as densely settled, its population would exceed 606\r\nmillions; and it would be 260,497,561, if numbering as many to the\r\nsquare mile as Massachusetts. Its average fertility far exceeds that of\r\nEurope, as does also the extent of its mines, especially gold, silver,\r\ncoal, and iron, with every variety of soil, climate, mineral and\r\nagricultural products.\r\n\r\nThese lands are surveyed at the expense of the Government into townships\r\nof six miles square, subdivided into sections, and these into quarter\r\nsections (160) acres, set apart for homesteads. Our system of public\r\nsurveys into squares, by lines running due north and south, east and\r\nwest, is so simple as to have precluded all disputes as to boundary or\r\ntitle. This domain reaches from the 24th to the 49th parallel, from the\r\nlakes to the gulf, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Its isothermes\r\n(the lines of equal mean annual temperatures) strike on the north the\r\ncoast of Norway midway, touch St. Petersburg in Russia, and pass through\r\nManchooria on the coast of Asia, about three degrees south of the mouth\r\nof the Amour river. On the south, these isothermes run through Northern\r\nAfrica, and nearly the centre of Egypt near Thebes, cross Northern\r\nArabia, Persia, Northern Hindostan, and Southern China near Canton.\r\n\r\nOf this vast domain, less than two per cent. is cursed by slavery, which\r\nis prohibited by law in eleven of these land States, and in all the\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nNow, however, within our present vast domain, not only the poor, but our\r\nown industrious classes and those of Europe, may not only find a home,\r\nbut a farm for each settler, substantially as a free gift by the\r\nGovernment. Here all who would rather be owners than tenants, and wish\r\nto improve and cultivate their own soil, are invited. Here, too, all who\r\nwould become equals among equals, citizens (not subjects) of a great and\r\nfree country, enjoying the right of suffrage, and eligible to every\r\noffice except the presidency, can come and occupy with us this great\r\ninheritance. Here liberty, equality, and fraternity reign supreme, not\r\nin theory, or in name only, but in truth and reality. This is the\r\nbrotherhood of man, secured and protected by our organic law. Here the\r\nConstitution and the people are the only sovereigns, and the Government\r\nis administered by their elected agents, and for the benefit of the\r\npeople. Those toiling elsewhere for wages that will scarcely support\r\nexistence, for the education of whose children no provision is made by\r\nlaw, who are excluded from the right of suffrage, may come here and be\r\nvoters and citizens, find a farm given as a homestead, free schools\r\nprovided for their children at the public expense, and hold any office\r\nbut the presidency, to which their children, born here, are eligible.\r\nWhat does Europe for any of its toiling millions who reject this\r\nmunificent offer? He is worked and taxed there to his utmost endurance.\r\nHe has the right to _work_, and _pay taxes_, but not to vote. Unschooled\r\nignorance is his lot and that of his descendants. If a farmer, he works\r\nand improves the land of others, in constant terror of rent day, the\r\nlandlord, and eviction. Indeed the annual rent of a single acre in\r\nEngland exceeds the price--$10 (£2. 2s. 8d.)--payable for the\r\nownership in fee simple of the entire homestead of 160 acres, granted\r\nhim here by the Government. For centuries that are past and for all time\r\nto come, there, severe toil, poverty, ignorance, the workhouse, or low\r\nwages, and disfranchisement, would seem to be his lot. Here, freedom,\r\ncompetence, the right of suffrage, the homestead farm, and free schools\r\nfor his children.\r\n\r\nIn selecting these homestead farms, the emigrant can have any\r\ntemperature, from St. Petersburg to Canton. He can have a cold, a\r\ntemperate, or a warm climate, and farming or gardening, grazing or\r\nvintage, varied by fishing or hunting. He can raise wheat, rye, Indian\r\ncorn, oats, rice, indigo, cotton, tobacco, cane or maple sugar and\r\nmolasses, sorghum, wool, peas and beans, Irish or sweet potatoes,\r\nbarley, buckwheat, wine, butter, cheese, hay, clover, and all the\r\ngrasses, hemp, hops, flax and flaxseed, silk, beeswax and honey, and\r\npoultry, in uncounted abundance. If he prefers a stock farm, he can\r\nraise horses, asses, and mules, camels, milch cows, working oxen, and\r\nother cattle, goats, sheep, and swine. In most locations, these will\r\nrequire neither housing nor feeding throughout the year. He can have\r\norchards, and all the fruits and vegetables of Europe, and many in\r\naddition. He can have an Irish or German, Scotch, English or Welsh,\r\nFrench, Swiss, Norwegian, or American neighborhood. He can select the\r\nshores of oceans, lakes, or rivers; live on tide water or higher lands,\r\nvalleys, or mountains. He can be near a church of his own denomination;\r\nthe freedom of conscience is complete; he pays no tithes, nor church\r\ntax, except voluntarily. His sons and daughters, on reaching twenty-one\r\nyears of age, or sooner, if the head of a family, are each entitled to a\r\nhomestead of 160 acres; if he dies, the title is secured to his widow,\r\nchildren, or heirs. Our flag is his, and covers him everywhere with its\r\nprotection. He is our brother; and he and his children will enjoy with\r\nus the same heritage of competence and freedom. He comes where labor is\r\nking, and toil is respected and rewarded. If before, or instead of\r\nreceiving his homestead, he chooses to pursue his profession or\r\nbusiness, to work at his trade, or for daily wages, he will find them\r\ndouble the European rate, and subsistence cheaper. From whatever part of\r\nEurope he may come, he will meet his countrymen here, and from them and\r\nus receive a cordial welcome. A Government which gives him a farm, the\r\nright to vote, and free schools for his children, must desire his\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nOf this vast domain (more than thirty-two times as large as England) the\r\nGovernment of the United States grants substantially as a free gift, a\r\n_farm of 160 acres_ to every settler who will occupy and cultivate the\r\nsame, the title being in fee simple, and free from all rent whatsoever.\r\nThe settler may be _native_ or _European_, a present or future\r\nimmigrant, including females as well as males, but must be at least\r\ntwenty-one years of age, _or_ the head of a family. If an immigrant, the\r\ndeclaration must first be made of an _intention_ to become a citizen of\r\nthe United States, when the grant is immediately made, without waiting\r\nfor naturalization. When the children of the settler reach twenty-one\r\nyears of age, or become the head of a family, they each receive from the\r\nGovernment a like donation of 160 acres. The intrinsic value of this\r\npublic domain far exceeds the whole public debt of the United States.\r\n\r\nOur national wealth, by the last census, was $16,159,616,068, and its\r\nincrease during the last ten years $8,925,481,011, or 126.45 per cent.\r\n(Census, 1860, p. 195.) Now, if, as a consequence of the Homestead Bill,\r\nthere should be occupied, improved, and cultivated, during the next ten\r\nyears, 100,000 additional farms by settlers, or only 10,000 per annum,\r\nit would make an aggregate of 16,000,000 acres. If, including houses,\r\nfences, barns, and other improvements, we should value each of these\r\nfarms at ten dollars an acre, it would make an aggregate of\r\n$160,000,000. But if we add the product of these farms, allowing only\r\none half of each (80 acres) to be cultivated, and the average annual\r\nvalue of the crops, stock included, to be only ten dollars per acre, it\r\nwould give $80,000,000 a year, and, in ten years, $800,000,000,\r\nindependent of the reinvestment of capital. It is clear that thus vast\r\nadditional employment would be given to labor, freight to steamers,\r\nrailroads, and canals, markets for manufactures, and augmented revenue.\r\n\r\nThe homestead privilege will largely increase immigration. Now, beside\r\nthe money brought here by immigrants, the census proves that the average\r\nannual value of the labor of Massachusetts, _per capita_, was, in 1860,\r\n$300 for each man, woman, and child. Assuming that of the immigrants at\r\nan average net annual value of only $100 each, or less than 33 cents a\r\nday, it would make, in ten years, at the rate of 200,000 each year, the\r\nfollowing aggregate:\r\n\r\n   1st year,  200,000  =  $20,000,000\r\n   2d    \"    400,000  \"   40,000,000\r\n   3d    \"    600,000  \"   60,000,000\r\n   4th   \"    800,000  \"   80,000,000\r\n   5th   \"  1,000,000  \"  100,000,000\r\n   6th   \"  1,200,000  \"  120,000,000\r\n   7th   \"  1,400,000  \"  140,000,000\r\n   8th   \"  1,600,000  \"  160,000,000\r\n   9th   \"  1,800,000  \"  180,000,000\r\n  10th   \"  2,000,000  \"  200,000,000\r\n                        -------------\r\n                Total, $1,100,000,000\r\n\r\nIn this table, the labor of all immigrants each year is properly added\r\nto those arriving the succeeding year, so as to make the aggregate, the\r\nlast year, two millions. This would make the value of the labor of these\r\ntwo millions of immigrants, in ten years, $1,100,000,000, independent of\r\nthe annual accumulation of capital, and the labor of the children of the\r\nimmigrants after the first ten years, which, with their descendants,\r\nwould go on constantly increasing.\r\n\r\nBut, by the actual official returns (see page 14 of Census), the number\r\nof alien immigrants to the United States, from December, 1850, to\r\nDecember, 1860, was 2,598,216, or an annual average of 259,821, say\r\n260,000. The effect, then, of this immigration, on the basis of the last\r\ntable, upon the increase of national wealth, was as follows:\r\n\r\n   1st year,   260,000  =  $26,000,000\r\n   2d    \"     520,000  \"   52,000,000\r\n   3d    \"     780,000  \"   78,000,000\r\n   4th   \"   1,040,000  \"  104,000,000\r\n   5th   \"   1,300,000  \"  130,000,000\r\n   6th   \"   1,560,000  \"  156,000,000\r\n   7th   \"   1,820,000  \"  182,000,000\r\n   8th   \"   2,080,000  \"  208,000,000\r\n   9th   \"   2,340,000  \"  234,000,000\r\n  10th   \"   2,600,000  \"  260,000,000\r\n                        --------------\r\n                 Total, $1,430,000,000\r\n\r\nThus the value of the labor of the immigrants from 1850 to 1860 was\r\nfourteen hundred and thirty millions of dollars, making no allowance for\r\nthe accumulation of capital by annual reinvestment, nor for the natural\r\nincrease of population, amounting, by the census, in ten years, to about\r\n24 per cent. This addition to our wealth by the labor of the children,\r\nin the first ten years, would be small; but in the second, and each\r\nsucceeding decennium, when we count children and their descendants, it\r\nwould be large and constantly augmenting. But the census shows that our\r\nwealth increases each ten years at the rate of 126.45 per cent. Now,\r\nthen, take our increase of wealth in consequence of immigration as\r\nbefore stated, and compound it at the rate of 126.45 per cent, every ten\r\nyears, and the result is largely over three billions of dollars in 1870,\r\nand over seven billions of dollars in 1880, independent of the effect of\r\nany immigration succeeding 1860. If these results are astonishing, we\r\nmust remember that immigration here is augmented population, and that it\r\nis population and labor that create wealth. Capital, indeed, is the\r\naccumulation of labor. Immigration, then, from 1850 to 1860, added to\r\nour national wealth a sum more than one third greater than our whole\r\ndebt on the 1st of July last, and augmenting in a ratio much more rapid\r\nthan its increase, and thus enabling us to bear the war expenses.\r\n\r\nAs the homestead privilege must largely increase immigration, and add\r\nespecially to the cultivation of our soil, it will contribute more than\r\nany other measure to increase our population, wealth, and power, and\r\naugment out revenue from duties and taxes.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, by the Census (p. 195), the total value of the real\r\nand personal estate in the United States was, in--\r\n\r\n  1860,     $16,159,616,068\r\n  1850,       7,135,780,228\r\n\r\nIncrease from 1850 to 1860, 126.45 per cent.\r\n\r\nAt the same rate of increase, for the four succeeding decades, the\r\nresult would be, in--\r\n\r\n  1870,      $36,593,450,585\r\n  1880,       82,865,868,849\r\n  1890,      187,314,353,225\r\n  1900,      423,330,438,288\r\n\r\nIf we subtract one fourth from the aggregate, we will find that our\r\npublic debt constitutes less than _one half of one per cent._ of the\r\n_increase_ of our national wealth. This debt, then, does not exhaust our\r\ncapital, but effects only a small diminution of the rate of\r\naugmentation.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the causes of this vast increase of our national wealth,\r\nthey will be found mainly in the enormous extent of our fertile lands,\r\nthe vast emigration from Europe, and the constant addition of new States\r\nto the Union. Thus, from 1850 to 1860, four new States were added to the\r\nUnion. These four States were almost an untrodden wilderness in 1850,\r\nbut in 1860 were rich and flourishing States, with a population of\r\n638,965, and an aggregate wealth of $331,809,418. Within this decade,\r\nfrom 1860 to 1870, at least six new States will be added to the Union.\r\nThis is evident from a reference to our present Territories, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Dacotah,        95,316,480 acres.\r\n  Nebraska,       48,636,800   \"\r\n  Indian,         56,924,000   \"\r\n  Idaho,         208,878,720   \"\r\n  Washington,     44,796,160   \"\r\n  Nevada,         52,184,960   \"\r\n  Utah,           68,084,480   \"\r\n  Arizona,        80,730,240   \"\r\n  New Mexico,     77,568,640   \"\r\n  Colorado,       66,880,000   \"\r\n                 -----------\r\n         Total,  800,000,480 acres.\r\n\r\nHere then are Territories with an aggregate area of 800,000,480 acres,\r\nsufficient for twenty-six States of the size of New York. In all these\r\nTerritories but one, the precious metals are found in great abundance,\r\nand the railroad to the Pacific, with numerous branches through this\r\nvast region, together with the greatest advantages of our new Homestead\r\nBill of last year, is settling these Territories with unprecedented\r\nrapidity. Notwithstanding the war, immigration to the United States is\r\nprogressing with more than its usual volume, caused by the very high\r\nwages for labor, the great benefits of our recent Homestead Bill, and\r\nthe exclusion, by recent act of Congress, of slavery from all this vast\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, that, whilst the _lands_ constituting these\r\nTerritories remain _public_ lands, no estimate is made of them as wealth\r\nin the national census. It is only when these public lands become farms\r\nand private property, that they are valued as part of the wealth of the\r\nnation. This remark also applies to that 255,000,000 acres of public\r\nlands in the sixteen _Land States_ of the Union. Hence the amazing\r\nincrease of wealth at each decade, in the new States and Territories.\r\nThus, by Table 35 of the Census of 1860, page 195, the rate of increase\r\nof wealth in the following States and Territories, from 1850 to 1860,\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n_Territories._\r\n\r\n  Washington,     5,000 per cent.\r\n  Nebraska,       4,800    \"\r\n  Utah,             467    \"\r\n  New Mexico,       302    \"\r\n\r\n_States._\r\n\r\n  Kansas,         8,000 per cent.\r\n  Iowa,             942    \"\r\n  California,       837    \"\r\n  Minnesota,      6,000    \"\r\n  Michigan,         330    \"\r\n  Oregon,      471      per cent.\r\n  Illinois,    457         \"\r\n  Wisconsin,   550         \"\r\n\r\nIt is thus that the wave of population moves onward in our Western\r\nStates and Territories, that the axe and the plough are the pioneers of\r\ncivilization, that farms, cities, and villages, the schoolhouse, and the\r\nchurch, rise from the wilderness, as if by the touch of an enchanter's\r\nwand. That enchantment is the power of _freedom and education_, the\r\neffect of which (as compared with the deadly influence of slavery and\r\nignorance) shall be illustrated in a succeeding letter. In that letter,\r\nby comparing the relative progress of our Free and Slave States, as\r\ndemonstrated by our Census, it will be proved, incontestably, that the\r\ntotal exclusion of slavery from our Union will cause an addition to our\r\nnational wealth vastly exceeding the whole public debt of our country,\r\nand soon leave us much richer than before the rebellion.\r\n\r\n                                                        R. J. WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECLINE OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Europe, two nations for almost a thousand years have contended for\r\nempire. England and France, for the greater portion of that period, have\r\nwaged war with each other. When not engaged in actual hostilities, they\r\nhave watched each other with jealous animosity--seeking by intrigue and\r\ndiplomatic schemes to thwart or defeat the designs which one or the\r\nother had formed for national aggrandizement.\r\n\r\nNo one of Anglo-Saxon descent can peruse the histories of those\r\ncountries, and not feel pride in the valor and success which have\r\ndistinguished his race. Twice the victorious banner of England has\r\nfluttered in the gaze of Paris. Until a recent age, the French flag\r\nvisited the ocean only at the sufferance of England.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the wisdom of the continental policy of\r\nEngland since 1688--in pursuance of which she has persistently sought to\r\ndefeat the ambition of France--no one can help admiring the ability and\r\nindomitable courage she has displayed in the gratification of her\r\nnational antipathy. From the League of Augsburg, of 1687, to which she\r\nbecame a party, to the Treaty of Utrecht, in 1713, she put forth\r\nherculean efforts to compel the relinquishment of the family compact by\r\nLouis XIV. By that treaty, the darling project of that monarch to secure\r\nthe crown of Spain for a Bourbon, was forever abandoned by France.\r\nElated with this triumph over her adversary, throughout the eighteenth\r\ncentury England continued to pursue the same policy of checking and\r\ndefeating all the schemes of France for territorial acquisition. It\r\nmattered not where; in whatever quarter of the globe France sought to\r\nplant her standard, she always found there an English enemy. In Asia,\r\nAfrica, and America, as well as in Europe, all her attempts to extend\r\nher empire were defeated by England. Pondicherry was the only East\r\nIndian possession which the genius of Clive allowed her to retain. By\r\nthe Treaty of Paris, of 1763, she was compelled to relinquish Canada in\r\norder to regain her West Indian islands conquered by England.[4]\r\n\r\nVainly, under good or bad, weak or potent sovereigns, did France\r\nattempt the enlargement of her empire or an increase of national power.\r\nEngland, on one pretence or another, always confronted her, and by\r\nsuccessful war, or unscrupulous diplomacy, baffled her designs.\r\n\r\nThe English mind was cultivated throughout the eighteenth century into\r\nthe belief that every accession to France was a menace and an injury to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAt last the French Revolution, inspiring with preternatural energy that\r\ngallant people, turned the tide of events so long adverse to French\r\naggrandizement. Still true to her hereditary hostility, England combined\r\nall Europe to resist the aggression of republican France. But soon, from\r\nthe raging elements of that awful convulsion, the 'Man of Destiny'\r\narose, who could 'ride the whirlwind and direct the storm.' He seized\r\nthe helm, evoked order from chaos, and smote the enemies of France\r\nwherever they appeared, revived the splendors of her early history, and,\r\nlike her mediæval Charlemagne, gave the law to Europe.\r\n\r\nEngland took the measure of Napoleon, and recognized in him an enemy\r\nwhom she must subdue at any cost, or submit to be reduced in the scale\r\nof nations to that importance and those proportions befitting her\r\ndiminutive territory in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Marengo--the Peace of Luneville--the ascendency of\r\nNapoleon on the continent--the defection of the continental allies of\r\nEngland--and the preparations of Napoleon for her invasion, led to the\r\nTreaty of Amiens.\r\n\r\nThat treaty, however, was only a brief truce, which England never\r\ndesigned to observe but temporarily. She refused to respect its\r\nobligations, and even to negotiate for its modification. She feared that\r\npeace would enable Napoleon to rebuild his shattered navy.\r\n\r\nLord Hawkesbury's note of March 15th, 1803, assigned as her avowed\r\nreason for the renewal of the war--'the acquisition made by France in\r\nvarious quarters, particularly in Italy, and therefore England would be\r\njustified in claiming equivalents for these acquisitions as a\r\ncounterpoise to the augmentation of the power of France.'[5]\r\n\r\nThis note of Lord Hawkesbury avows distinctly the spirit of the foreign\r\npolicy of England for the last two hundred years. She would not tolerate\r\nany acquisition by her rival unless she obtained 'equivalents.' In\r\npursuance of this unchangeable policy, she again declared war against\r\nFrance. Mr. Pitt resumed his position of prime minister, and soon formed\r\na new continental coalition to resist the mighty power and the\r\naggressions of the French emperor.\r\n\r\nThenceforward she listened to no overtures for peace, but prosecuted\r\nwith implacable resentment the war--until she finally prostrated her\r\nimperial foe, and became his inglorious jailer, until death relieved her\r\nfrom all apprehensions of danger.\r\n\r\nBut this triumph of a vindictive policy, so gratifying to the national\r\nantipathy, was purchased at a price perhaps far exceeding its value.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of Napoleon was an achievement which compelled England to\r\nanticipate the resources of future generations. These generations have\r\ncome, and are coming, and they find themselves unable any longer to\r\ncontend with French ambition.\r\n\r\nThe first Napoleon, whom England fought with such relentless animosity,\r\nwon his throne by the display of matchless ability in the field and the\r\ncabinet. The present Napoleon reached _his_ throne by perjury,\r\nassassination, and crimes of the blackest atrocity. The first Napoleon\r\nEngland pursued with her hatred to his grave. The present Napoleon,\r\nreeking with the blood of his unarmed fellow citizens, kisses the queen\r\nof England, and the _entente cordial_ with him becomes the foreign\r\npolicy of England. Entangled in his toils, she makes war on Russia as\r\nhis ally, stands silently while he humbles Austria and changes the map\r\nof Europe, and barely escapes by an afterthought being dragged into an\r\nattempt to destroy a free republic in America, to enable France to\r\naugment the area for the expansion of the Latin race at the expense of\r\nthat of the Anglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\nWhat would the great Chatham and his son--who so long moulded the\r\ndestiny of Europe--say, if they could revisit the earth and peruse the\r\nhistory of their country for the last twelve years? Would they recognize\r\nher as that England who in their hands smote the house of Bourbon, and\r\ninaugurated the policy which led to the overthrow of the greatest\r\ncaptain who ever tormented with his lust for glory the human race?\r\nCertainly, in all the wars which England waged against the house of\r\nBourbon, France never attempted a conquest of greater value than that\r\nwhich the present Napoleon has commenced in Mexico. Certainly, no\r\nconquest which the first Napoleon ever threatened in Europe would have\r\nso strengthened France as would the annexation of Mexico to her\r\ndominions. But England has expended in her wars with the first Napoleon,\r\nto restrain him from acquisitions which could not have materially\r\ninjured England, all her resources for war. She is not in the condition\r\nto wage such wars with France as she prosecuted during the last and the\r\nbeginning of the present century. She knows that she must acquiesce in\r\nthe ambitious acquisitions of the present Napoleon, or else encounter\r\nhis hostility. Cherbourg and the steam navy of France render an invasion\r\nof the British Isles a more practicable achievement for the present\r\nNapoleon than ever the first Napoleon could hope for. England shrinks,\r\ntherefore, from any effort to curb the present aggrandizement of France,\r\nfrom _fear_. She ignominiously renounces and abandons the policy of her\r\nmonarchy, her aristocracy, and her people--pursued for two hundred years\r\nwith unfaltering pertinacity; not because she condemns it, not because\r\nshe does not feel 'justified' in resisting French acquisitions unless\r\n'equivalents for these acquisitions as a counterpoise to the\r\naugmentation of the power of France' are obtained; but obviously,\r\nbecause she fears to encounter the arms of the present Napoleon.\r\n\r\nWhen the French emperor forced upon the acceptance of Lord Aberdeen's\r\ncabinet 'the harsh and insulting scheme of action' (as Kinglake calls\r\nit) which provoked the war with Russia in 1854, England's dilemma was: a\r\nwar with Nicholas, or a rupture with France. 'The negotiation which had\r\nseemed to be almost ripe for a settlement was then ruined.'[6]\r\n\r\nA war for Napoleon at that time with one of the great powers, was a\r\nnecessity. It was necessary for the stability of his throne. It was\r\nnecessary to prevent the thoughts of France from dwelling upon the\r\nassassination of the republic and her own infamy in submitting to that\r\nenormous villany. If it had not been Russia, it would have been England\r\nthat the imperial usurper would have denounced as disturbing the waters\r\nfor his provocation.\r\n\r\nMellowed by time, and enlightened by their deplorable results, England\r\nnow views the wars with Napoleon the First in their true light. So far\r\nfrom British power having been augmented by that tremendous struggle, it\r\nhas compelled England to descend from the position of a first-rate to\r\nthat of a second-rate power, so far as it concerns the politics of\r\nEurope. Had the first Napoleon survived to this day, she would hardly\r\nhave consented to act with the same subserviency to him as she now\r\nvoluntarily acts toward his ignoble counterfeit. She would never have\r\nstood an idle spectator of the humiliation of Austria by him. She would\r\nnever have permitted him to betray her into the causeless and ridiculous\r\nwar with her ancient ally Russia. It was the aid of Russia which\r\nenabled her to overthrow the great Napoleon, and now she permits the\r\nlittle Napoleon to bully her into a war with Russia that he may bedizen\r\nhis name with the glory of a conflict with the conqueror of his\r\nillustrious kinsman.\r\n\r\nIf the object of Napoleon was so ignominious, contemptible, and\r\ncriminal, as we know it to have been, in producing the war of 1854, with\r\nwhat obloquy must England be covered for allowing herself to be beguiled\r\ninto such a war by such a juggler?\r\n\r\nThe pretended cause of the Crimean war, as alleged, was the threatened\r\ninvasion of Turkey by Nicholas. But what injury was _that_ to England,\r\ncompared to the seizure of Mexico by France?\r\n\r\nEngland had not for two hundred years made it the chief object of her\r\nforeign policy to resist the expansion of the Russian empire. She had\r\nacquiesced in the partition of Poland, and by the Treaty of Vienna made\r\nherself a party to that nefarious spoliation by Russia, Austria, and\r\nPrussia. She knew that Austria, Prussia, and the German Confederation\r\nwere pledged to protect Turkey from Russia.[7] Her subserviency to\r\nFrance in separately with her making war on Russia, upon the pretence of\r\nthe protection of Turkey, was supererogatory as well as needless.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, and so will history make up the record, the French emperor\r\ndesired to humiliate England, and England dare not refuse to be\r\nhumiliated by him. It was a 'GREAT SURRENDER.'[8]\r\n\r\nIt will not do for England to excuse herself for not resisting the\r\nFrench invasion of Mexico by any such allegation as that she has\r\nreceived Napoleon's assurances that he does not intend to make a French\r\nprovince of Mexico. She must know, that no confidence can be placed in\r\nhis veracity. She must know, that such assurances are but a flimsy veil\r\nto deceive her and other nations. They are designed to meet the\r\ncontingency--of Federal success in crushing rebellion.\r\n\r\nHe has been willing to be fooled by those who surround him, into the\r\nbelief that the rebels will achieve their independence.[9] In that\r\nevent, he will never relinquish his grasp on Mexico, unless compelled to\r\ndo so by force of arms. Should the rebellion succeed, as he professes to\r\nbelieve it will, his instrument and accomplice, Maximilian, will be\r\ndiscarded with as little ceremony as the first Napoleon discarded some\r\nof the puppet kings whom he saw proper to crown and discrown according\r\nto the exigency of his occasions.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) terminated one of the wars of\r\nEngland with Louis XIV. The renunciation by France of the cause of the\r\nPretender was the most material advantage accruing to England from that\r\ntreaty. But the ink was hardly dry with which it was written, before\r\nEngland took umbrage at France for efforts to rebuild her navy, which\r\nhad been seriously reduced and crippled by the events of the previous\r\nwar, and also for the encroachments of the French in Canada on the\r\nEnglish settlements. For these causes the Seven Years' War was\r\ncommenced, and, under the auspices of the first William Pitt,\r\nsuccessfully prosecuted, until France was completely humbled. Now,\r\nhowever, Napoleon the Third constructs a navy more powerful than France\r\never before possessed, and, instead of molesting some obscure English\r\nsettlement in the interior of America, appropriates to himself a great\r\ncountry, fertile in resources, with mines of incalculable wealth, and in\r\nclose proximity to English colonies, cherished by the most vigilant\r\nprotection of England.\r\n\r\nThe value of Mexico is thus portrayed by the British historian Alison\r\n(vol. iv., p. 423):\r\n\r\n     'Humboldt has told us that he was never wearied with astonishment\r\n     at the smallness of the portion of soil which, in Mexico and the\r\n     adjoining provinces, would yield sustenance to a family for a year:\r\n     and that the same extent of ground which in wheat would maintain\r\n     only two persons, would yield sustenance under the banana to fifty;\r\n     though in that favored region the return of wheat is never under\r\n     seventy, sometimes as much as a hundred fold. The return on an\r\n     average of Great Britain is not more than nine to one. If due\r\n     weight be given to these extraordinary facts, it will not appear\r\n     extravagant to assert that Mexico, with a territory embracing seven\r\n     times the whole area of France, may at some future and possibly not\r\n     remote period contain two hundred millions of inhabitants.'\r\n\r\nThis is the magnificent empire which France now seeks to conquer,\r\nwithout a murmur of remonstrance from Great Britain, who so often\r\ncombined Europe to resist the petty acquisition by France of territory\r\nless than one of the Mexican States.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that England relies on the United States to\r\nprevent Mexico becoming a French province. Her statesmen have for the\r\npast two years professed the belief that the dismemberment of the United\r\nStates is inevitable. In that event, they must know that the United\r\nStates would prove no obstacle to the occupation of Mexico by France.\r\nNo; the acquiescence of England in this gigantic acquisition of France\r\ncan be ascribed to no such assurance of the power of the United States.\r\nIt may be said that she has flattered herself that by letting alone\r\nNapoleon, he may possibly, by an alliance with the rebels, secure the\r\npermanent dissolution of the American Union;--that the United States, if\r\nsuccessful in crushing the rebellion, would be to her a greater terror\r\nthan Napoleon. We do not believe that she is influenced by such\r\nconsiderations. She knows that the United States, however powerful by\r\nthe recent development of military strength, would hardly attempt the\r\ninvasion of the British Islands. But she has no such faith in her crafty\r\nneighbor. She knows that France and the Bonapartes owe her a debt of\r\nvengeance which only the ravage and desolation of the British soil will\r\never liquidate. She remembers that the favorite scheme of Napoleon the\r\nFirst was the invasion of England; and she knows that this scheme is\r\namong the _Idées Napoléon_ of the nephew. She is aware, too, that\r\nNapoleon the Third has the means at his command which will enable him to\r\nplace any number of troops on her shores. She is satisfied that upon the\r\nfirst provocation which she offers, he will gratify the treasured hatred\r\nof the French and of his family, by consummating the darling project of\r\nhis uncle. The terror of invasion has induced her to change the nature\r\nof her foreign policy. She will cling to the French alliance until the\r\nFrench emperor has satiated his national craving for her degradation;\r\nand not until he strikes her a blow, which will resound throughout the\r\nworld, will England be prepared to battle with the Gaul. No future\r\naccession of territory would make France more formidable for the\r\ninvasion of England than she is now. Her army of five hundred thousand\r\nmen, and her steam navy and ironclads are all-sufficient for that\r\npurpose, whenever the French emperor chooses so to employ them. But if\r\nNapoleon devotes this army and that navy to such a formidable conquest\r\nas that of a country seven times as large as France, three thousand\r\nmiles from her shores, it is not probable that he will soon be able to\r\nspare them for the invasion of Great Britain. Spain vainly struggled for\r\nyears to conquer her revolted provinces in America. England failed to\r\nconquer her rebellious colonies, with a population not exceeding three\r\nmillions. France lost an army of thirty-five thousand men, veterans of\r\nMoreau's, in the vain effort to subdue the negroes of St. Domingo.\r\nEngland could desire no better scheme for the destruction of the\r\nmilitary strength of Napoleon than that of the attempted conquest of\r\nMexico. She will therefore rather stimulate than restrain the second\r\nFrench emperor in his desire to devote his legions to the enlargement of\r\nthe area for the supremacy of the Latin race in America. Her motive will\r\nbe the despicable safety of her shores from Gallic invasion. For this\r\nshe sacrifices her prestige in the world--her hereditary policy--the\r\ntime-honored traditions of the Anglo-Saxon. The world hereafter is free\r\nto the Frenchman, for robbery, spoliation, conquest, and invasion,\r\nwherever else than in England he chooses to prosecute the vocation of\r\nnational crime. England is no longer the foe of French ambition or\r\nrapacity. So long as France will abstain from the invasion of the\r\n'inviolate isle,' where for almost a thousand years no foreign enemy has\r\nplaced his foot, so long she may be free from molestation from England,\r\nwhatever else she may attempt; and this is the inglorious policy of\r\nEngland in the year of our Lord 1862-'3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [A literal translation of this remarkable prose-poem was kindly\r\n     placed in our hands by Prof. Podbielski. It is allegorical\r\n     throughout, every phase of its marvellous symbolism resting upon\r\n     dire and tragic truth.\r\n\r\n     The many times murdered Mother is of course Poland. We hope that\r\n     the publication of this prophetic vision of her great son, patriot,\r\n     poet, statesman, and sage, as he undoubtedly was, may excite a\r\n     vivid interest at the present hour, when that heroic but unhappy\r\n     country is again struggling for life and freedom.\r\n\r\n     In its present English form, 'Temptation' is reverently dedicated\r\n     to the patriot sons of the Mother of heroes, by MARTHA W.\r\n     COOK.]\r\n\r\n  Alas, crimsoned with blood and swollen with tears run our troubled\r\n      life-waves!\r\n  From the depths and whirlpools of the stormful currents sounds the\r\n      moan of eternal sorrow!\r\n  Behind roars the bottomless abyss, black with the gloomy mists rising\r\n      from the woes of the Past:\r\n  Before lies the far-off Heaven, burning and blazing with flames red\r\n      as of blood:\r\n  Around struggle the swimmers, in surges so cold, hopeless,\r\n      and murky,\r\n  That from each as he floats onward is forced the cry; 'WOE! THE\r\n      CURSE IS UPON ME!'\r\n\r\nMother, many times murdered! Unhappy mother! with the long and countless\r\nblades of thy ever-green grasses, with the waving stems of thy grain\r\nfields, thou wilt bind our undying memories closely to thee, but\r\nhenceforth must thy sons wander and suffer, as they love thee. Behind\r\nthem, from sea to sea, is the Grave; before them, wheresoever they may\r\nroam, the Sun set; while monarchs and merchants curse the endless\r\nprogression!\r\n\r\nThe Living cannot understand those reared on the bosom of the\r\nDead--human faces grow pale at the approach of the spectres--at the echo\r\nof their footsteps the home-fires glimmer and flicker low on the\r\nhearthstone--the mother hides her child--the wife leads away the husband\r\nthat he may not clasp hands with the wandering exile,--the evening star\r\nalone, the star of graves, smiles from Heaven on them!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWas not the silence of the forests holy? When the wind swept over the\r\nPines, did not the mystic murmurs, sacred as the prayers of the Priest,\r\nsay to you: 'Nowhere there will you find your God!' The spaces are\r\nfilled with the giant skeletons torn from the dim woods; they are\r\nchained and clamped with iron and fed with steam; the eagles soar not in\r\nthe air above them, nor do the glad birds twitter in the swaying\r\nbranches; none among you may mount the strong horse of the desert and\r\nfly afar over the boundless steppes, rejoicing in his arrowy\r\nswiftness;--you are alone in the midst of the world!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs you wander on, poor exiles, your very gratitude is half disdain! When\r\nthey lead you into cities without castles or temples, where trade and\r\ncommerce rule; among whitewashed houses where the spirit of Beauty is\r\nnot, and the green window-shutters are the sole adornment--murmur ye:\r\nTHE DEAD!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the shores of the seas when you dwell with Jews, Armenians, and\r\nGreeks, quarrelling forever over their vile profits; seeing not the\r\nheavens, nor hearing the thunder as it booms over the waves--murmur ye:\r\nTHE DEAD!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen women in rich attire move around you, and you feel that the faint\r\nfluttering of the silken robe is far more spiritual than the life-breath\r\nof their souls--murmur ye: THE DEAD!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFloat on, then, like the sacred whispers from the unhewn forests! The\r\nworld will not know you, because you are of the race sprung from\r\ncoffins; born and cradled in coffins; but as you rise from the grave,\r\nstrew upon the ground beneath your feet the mouldering rags of your\r\nshrouds--and _he_, seated on the verge of the abyss, on the steep and\r\nslippery declivity; _he_, robed in the royal purple of power, will not\r\nsurvive your Resurrection--but must himself descend into the coffin!\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw imaged before me, as in a wondrous vision, the varied scenes and\r\nchanges as it were of a long life--rising, progressing, and vanishing,\r\nas if bound in a single day, beginning with the morning and fleeting\r\naway with the evening shadows.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me in my vision that the morning was strangely transparent.\r\nNo clouds dulled the ether above. Far over the wide green space rose the\r\nsun, and in front of the House on the Hill stood a horse already\r\nsaddled, impatiently wounding the velvety grass with his iron hoofs, and\r\nsnuffing with wide nostrils the fresh breeze from the valley. Near him\r\nstood his young master. The light in his blue eye was bright as the\r\nyoung beam of the day. He had one foot in the stirrup, and the other on\r\nthe soft home-turf; with one hand caressing the long waving mane of the\r\nsteed, and the other clasped in the grasp of the man from whom he was\r\ntaking leave--they knew not for how long, but yet felt it was not\r\nforever. Words were pouring from the heart of the one into the heart of\r\nthe other. The elder, he who stood on the ground and was to move on on\r\nfoot, kept his gaze steadily fixed on the rocks and forests lying beyond\r\nthe smooth green turf. The younger, with raised eyes, gazed into the\r\nsky, as if absorbing its light in the blue lustrous pupils; and when he\r\nspoke, his voice was like the fresh breath of spring. The elder spoke\r\nmore slowly, almost sternly, as though advising, warning, beseeching--as\r\nif he loved deeply, yet doubted, feared; but the younger had no fear, no\r\ndoubts--he pledged himself and vowed--threw himself first into the arms\r\nof his friend, then leaped into his saddle. He pushed his horse rapidly\r\non, swift as the arrow skims the plain, or the mountain stream plunges\r\nbelow. A cloud of servants poured forth from the halls of the ancient\r\nHouse, and followed their young Lord.\r\n\r\nHe who remained behind, knelt; and fragments of his prayer were brought\r\nme by the wind, 'O Heavenly Father! let not this blooming soul wither\r\naway upon this arid earth! Lead it not into the temptation of human\r\nservitude; remove from it all sinful stain! Let it serve Thee alone!\r\nThee and the many times murdered Mother!'\r\n\r\nHe continued kneeling, although sunk in silence, as if wrapped in deep\r\nmeditation, scarcely knowing whether to indulge in the dim prophecies\r\nthen surging his soul, or to prolong his prayers. Then I saw him start,\r\nclasp his hands forcibly together--and again his words were borne to me\r\nby the wind.\r\n\r\n'O Heavenly Father! I ask Thee not to sweeten the bitter cup of life for\r\nmy friend; I know that all who live must suffer; but, O merciful God,\r\nspare him the blush of shame, the infamy of weakness!'\r\n\r\nThen I saw the Wanderer rise from his knees, descend the hill, and make\r\nhis way on foot through the forest to the distant rocks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout high noon of the same day they met again before the gate of a\r\ngreat city. The young man was still on his horse, his fair brow already\r\ndarkened by the heat of the sun; the dew from the fresh home-turf was\r\nquite dry upon his stirrups, and the glitter of the steel dimmed with\r\nrust. The horse gladly stopped, as if wearied with his rapid flight\r\nthrough the distant space, but the blue eye of the youth still sparkled\r\nwith its early fire.\r\n\r\nThe elder, gray from head to foot with the dust of the road, seated\r\nhimself on a stone by the wayside. The youth jumped lightly to the\r\nearth, and threw himself into the arms of his friend. I saw him give his\r\nhorse in charge to his servants, take the arm of his companion, enter\r\nthe gate of the great city, and lead him to the imperial Palace. In one\r\nof the inner chambers they sat down together to rest. They conversed\r\nhowever in whispers, as if they feared the ear of the enemy even through\r\nthe massive stone walls. Stretching himself on the soft Persian carpet,\r\nthe younger raised the cup of wrought silver to his thirsty lip. But\r\nwhen he handed it to the elder, he refused to taste the wine from the\r\nrich goblet. Nor would he look upon the tapestried walls, or the objects\r\nof luxury lying profusely scattered around the room, even when pointed\r\nout to him by his young companion. At last he rose, and taking the hand\r\nof the youth, led him to a window, from which the entire city was seen\r\nlying below, with the moving crowds of the populous nation. The immense\r\ncity, wonderfully monotonous in its whitewashed walls! the immense\r\nnation, wonderfully monotonous in its black garments! The young man\r\nlooked on curiously; the wanderer sighed, and said: 'When they shall\r\nlead you into cities without castles or temples, where the spirit of\r\nfreedom is chained, murmur ye: THE DEAD!'\r\n\r\nBut the younger continued to gaze with ever-growing interest. Carriages\r\nfilled with women dressed in brilliant hues were rapidly driving by,\r\ndrawn by strong, fleet horses. He saw one drive aside from the throng,\r\nthe snowy veil and white draperies of the fair one within fluttering and\r\nfloating far on, the breeze, as if the flying chariot were borne onward\r\nby the outspread sails. The Wanderer sighed, and said: 'When women in\r\nrich attire move around you, and you feel that the faint fluttering of\r\nthe snowy robe is more spiritual than the life-breath of their\r\nsouls--murmur ye: THE DEAD!'\r\n\r\nThe young man seemed not to hear the words of his friend. Heavy masses\r\nof lurid clouds gathered from every direction, and obscured the face of\r\nthe sky. How different the hour of the gloomy noon from that of the\r\nfresh, transparent morning!\r\n\r\nThe men before whom the People of the Black Nation kneel and prostrate\r\nthemselves now began to move through the streets. Their short garments\r\nglittered with gold, and were richly embroidered in gorgeous colors.\r\nThey wore long thin swords at their sides, and thick tufts of plumes on\r\ntheir heads. Shouting with harsh voices, they passed on in power,\r\nstriking the children who were lingering in the road as they moved\r\nforward. The children cried and wept; the crowd drew back and fled; and\r\nthey remained alone upon the Great Square. More and more of them were\r\never thronging there; more and more courteously they ever bowed to one\r\nanother, and lower and lower grew their salutes, until at last One rode\r\nforward on a steed richly caparisoned--and then they all fell down with\r\ntheir faces upon the ground--as if he were the Lord of Life and Death.\r\n\r\nThen said the Wanderer: 'He is already on the verge of the abyss, on the\r\nslope of the steep and slippery declivity; he, robed in the purple of\r\nPower, must himself descend into the coffin!'\r\n\r\nBut the young man riveted his gaze on the magnificence of the rider, as\r\nif absorbing the diamond glitter into the lustrous pupils of his eyes,\r\nas in the morning they had absorbed and reflected the clear blue of the\r\nskies. He seemed not to hear the words of his friend. When they were\r\nearnestly repeated to him, he covered his face with his hands, and\r\ntenderly uttered the holy name of the murdered Mother, as if the love of\r\nchildhood were upon his heart. The Wanderer pressed him to his breast,\r\nand said: 'Look not upon them! Look not upon them!'\r\n\r\n'Never! never!' he replied, as he again threw himself down to rest upon\r\nthe Persian carpet.\r\n\r\nAs the Wanderer rose to depart, I heard the prayer again rising to God\r\nfrom his divining soul:\r\n\r\n'O Heavenly Father! even at the burning noon of this bitter trial, I\r\nimplore Thee for him whom I love! O God! I now entreat Thee to work a\r\nmiracle in his behalf--to sweeten the bitter cup of life for this young,\r\neager, thirsting soul! Deliver it from the temptations with which Thou\r\nhast seen good to surround the strong on this earth, led like him into\r\nthese snares! Let him not fall, I beseech Thee, as did even the mighty\r\nand beautiful angels round Thy Throne, when the thirst for power was\r\nupon them. Save him, O God!'\r\n\r\nThe young man remained alone, utterly alone, in the midst of the great\r\ncity, and was soon forced to seek companionship with his fellow beings.\r\nIt was strange, meanwhile, how black the heavens grew, as if the whole\r\nsky were sheeted with a curtain of lead. I saw him now constantly in the\r\nstreets, the rooms, and in the midst of the people: he fascinated my\r\ngaze as if I saw only him. Under the calm of a tranquil face, he\r\nconcealed bitter torment, intense suffering. Evil thoughts are winding\r\nthrough him, like swarms of black and poisonous worms, while the good\r\nare also thronging near him, like clouds of bright blue fireflies. The\r\nworms crawl over his heart, boring and bleeding it as they writhe; the\r\nfireflies would burn out the black congested gore, and cure the\r\nfestering wounds, but new swarms of reptiles are forever sliming into\r\nlife, and ever deeper and more gangrened are the wounds they make.\r\nEverywhere danger, everywhere torment; there is no human being whom he\r\nmay trust! He too must learn to deceive in turn, to betray even women\r\nand children; must learn to lie as the masterpiece of art. He attains\r\nskill in the profession, and can command looks, smiles, tears, emotions;\r\nbut alas! the light in his clear eye, once rivalling the young beam of\r\nday, no longer flashes from his pupils. Pity him, O God! his very\r\ngarments become a lie; he throws aside the costume of his nation, in\r\nwhich he once rode so freely over the boundless steppe. He mounts on his\r\nhead the tall tufts of plumes; he girds the thin sword to his side; and\r\nI saw in my dream that the people began to fall back before him, and\r\nbow as he drew near.\r\n\r\nBut I saw that the steed of the desert refused to recognize his master\r\nwhen he entered the courtyard of the Palace. In vain he pats, with his\r\nown hand, the wavy silken mane: no neigh of joy now answers his caress;\r\nhe strives to leap upon him as in the morning of this eventful day, but\r\nthe haughty charger rears, stands erect upon his hind legs, and refuses\r\nto be mounted. Enraged beyond control, he thrusts his long sword into\r\nthe glossy flanks. The startled animal breaks away, spurns the\r\nblood-sprinkled soil, and flies thundering afar, rattling and clashing\r\nhis iron hoofs on the pavement, marking his track with a long line of\r\nglittering sparks, flashing but to die in the dying light of evening!\r\n\r\nThe hour of twilight is already on the earth!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain, for the third time in that day of life, met the Wanderer and his\r\nfriend. They stood together in a Church, which was without the gates,\r\nand the cross on its towers was different from those on the Basilicas\r\nwithin the walls of the city. The altar was without adornment, and, as\r\nwell as the walls and ceilings, was shrouded in the deepest mourning.\r\nThree tapers only were upon it, and they struggled vainly with the\r\nsurrounding gloom.\r\n\r\nI saw the Wanderer take one of these lights, and gaze, with a look of\r\nwoe, upon the face of his friend. The young man was silent, he found no\r\nutterance, he had lost the secret of revealing, by honest words, the\r\ndepths of the soul. But the bitter truth was expressed in the long wild\r\ncry which burst spasmodically from his lips. In it might be read the\r\nseduction and destruction of a young spirit, not consenting to its own\r\nshame and ruin!\r\n\r\nHe laid his head on the strong shoulder of his friend, and closed his\r\nheavy eyelids, as if he dreamed, in this trying moment, it would be\r\npossible for him thus to close them forever. But the Wanderer, suddenly\r\ncalling him back to consciousness, said: 'Follow me! follow me, that\r\nthou mayst remember forever the Form of the murdered Mother!'\r\n\r\nSo saying, he led the young man to a low door which opened behind the\r\nGreat Altar. A whirlwind, as if from plains of ice, blew upon them from\r\nthe subterranean passages below, and the flame of the taper streamed\r\nupon the blast, swaying and torn into a line of dying sparks. And thus\r\nthey commenced the plunge into the very bosom of night, descending ever\r\nlower and lower, exploring depth after depth, until at last they had\r\nworked their way through the narrow and winding passages, and stood in\r\nthe sublime silence of the immensity of space.\r\n\r\nTheir taper had long ago gone out, but they needed not its flickering\r\nlight. The swamp-fires of the night, the corpse-lights, the\r\nwill-o'-the-wisps, sometimes fell like falling stars; sometimes rose\r\nlike rising moons. Countless cemeteries seemed moving on in this weird\r\nlight, one solemnly following the other, and on the dark gate of each\r\nglittered, as if graved in frosted silver, the name of the Murdered\r\nNation, and on the white crosses gleaming within, the names of her\r\nmartyred children. Vast piles of skeletons, of bones and skulls, lay in\r\nthe path of the young man, and as he advanced he read the glorious\r\ninscriptions.\r\n\r\nIt now seemed to him that the ghosts of the buried were also moving on\r\nbefore him, increasing constantly in number, and all moaning as they\r\nsped on, until at last they seemed to condense into a murky vapor like a\r\ntrailing storm-cloud, growing ever more and more pervading, and\r\nmurmuring with thousands upon thousands of sad, but spirit-stirring\r\nnational songs. The air gleamed with the flashing of sabres and wild\r\nwaving of standards; conflagrations and flames filled the intervening\r\nspaces, like vivid flashes of restless lightning, now gleaming, now\r\nsinking into the bosom of the cloud. Faster and faster, farther and\r\nfarther whirls the cloud of spirits. Then in my dream I saw them\r\nsuddenly descend, driven over the earth like the withered leaves of\r\nautumn--beaten low upon the ground and drifting on like the summer's\r\ndust--while a strong cry burst from the driven shadows: 'O God, have\r\nmercy upon us!'\r\n\r\nThe Wanderer stopped before the gate of an open sepulchre, on which was\r\ngraven the name of the many times Murdered. The letters blazed with a\r\nsoft lambent flame, and he fell reverently upon his knees. Penetrated\r\nwith mystic awe, he quivered from head to foot when he arose, and wept\r\ntenderly as he crossed the threshold.\r\n\r\nA soft light, like that of an evening late in autumn, dimly illumined\r\nthe space within. I saw the holy Coffin as it lay on the gentle slope of\r\na hill; a giant Pine stood at its head, and in its topmost branches\r\nperched the Eagle, pierced to the heart and sleeping in its own blood.\r\nWithin the coffin lay the sacred Form, with the cross on her breast, the\r\nveil on her face, the fetters on her hands, and the crown upon her\r\nforehead. I saw six such hills rising one after the other, separated\r\nfrom one another by the long grass, through which, in place of sunny\r\nbrooks, flowed crimson streams of human gore. Hilts and shivered\r\nfragments of broken swords, overgrown with weeds and covered with rust,\r\nwere lying scattered in every direction through the rank grass. On each\r\nof the six hills lay the same Coffin; the same Form. But always more and\r\nmore strongly surged the streams of human blood; heavier and heavier\r\ngrew the chains on the hands of the Dead; and paler and paler the dim\r\nautumnal light. At the foot of the last hill it was dark, and bitter\r\ncold; the currents of blood were frozen; the icicles hung from the\r\nbranches of the Pine; the Eagle lay in his congealed gore; and in place\r\nof the veil, the face of the six times murdered Mother was closely\r\ncovered with a sheet of snow.\r\n\r\nWhen the young man reached this spot of gloom, he fell with his face\r\nupon the frozen earth, and cursed his life! In the distance sounded the\r\nmoans of the shadows left at the gate of the sepulchre; he bowed his\r\nhead and wept. He heard them ask: 'Is the six times Murdered really\r\ndead? will she rise no more to deliver her faithful children from mortal\r\nanguish?'\r\n\r\nThe Wanderer replied not, but looked with eyes of melancholy love upon\r\nhis friend who had thrown himself upon the frozen earth, and gently\r\nraised him in his strong arms.\r\n\r\nThen rose the wail of all the armies of the grave; they broke the\r\nsilence of death with loud and fearful cries: 'O Heavenly Father, Thou\r\nhast betrayed us! Thou hast delivered us up to Hell, for our Saint is\r\nreally dead!'\r\n\r\nThe Wanderer answered the cry, and his voice pealed like distant\r\nthunder. 'Blaspheme not! Our Saint yet breathes! I see her lying in her\r\nlast coffin on the hill of ice--there is no seventh beyond it--from it\r\ncomes the Resurrection!' The wails and sobs of the spirits suddenly\r\nceased, and a murmuring chant of the Mother's was entoned, low and sweet\r\nas the first sigh of a germing hope.\r\n\r\nThe young man now perceived, for hitherto he had not seen it, the\r\nillimitable space beyond the coffin. Afar over the infinite blue broke\r\nthe growing splendor of the early dawn--the clash and clamor of battles\r\nyet unborn broke through the veil of Time--and above it all he heard the\r\nMother's ancient hymn of victory!\r\n\r\nThe young dawn shone but for a moment, the clash of battle ceased, the\r\nsong of triumph died upon the ear--the gloomy silence of the twilight\r\nwas again upon them, and frost and cold upon the earth. The two friends\r\nreverently pressed their lips upon the still feet of the fettered Form;\r\ntogether listened to the faint breathing from the icy lips, catching it\r\neven through the veil of snow shrouding the sacred face; together they\r\nascended the frozen hill, bowing their heads in their hands to hide\r\ntheir tears.\r\n\r\nI saw them again as they were returning by the same road, and overheard\r\nthem binding themselves with fearful oaths. The Wanderer took leave of\r\nthe young man at the entrance of the church, saying with wonderfully\r\ntender and conjuring tones: 'Be not deceived by those who would fain\r\nruin thy soul, and blot out thy name from the number of honorable sounds\r\non earth! Remember, whatsoever the splendor of the things thou shalt\r\nthis night see, they are but deceptions from the lowest Hell! Then\r\nplacing his hand on the heart of the young man, he prayed: 'O Heavenly\r\nFather! have mercy upon him and upon me, for if he withstands not this\r\nterrible Temptation, Thou knowest we shall both have lived in vain, and\r\nour part on earth is done forever! After this they parted, and went\r\ntheir way on different routes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was already night in the great city. Innumerable throngs were\r\ncrowding the streets, all moving in the same direction, to the palace\r\nlighted with a thousand lamps, sounding with music, and gay with the\r\ndance. Old and young, men and women thronged the brazen stairs leading\r\nto the upper saloons; hurrying on as eagerly, as unceasingly as if\r\nascending into Heaven!\r\n\r\nThe hours of the night passed slowly by, seeming longer to me than the\r\nwhole of the preceding day. It was almost one o'clock before I again saw\r\nthe young man, and the traces of the oaths he had taken were cunningly\r\nhidden under smiles. Groups of servants stood around him; he carelessly\r\nthrew them his cloak, and climbed with the rest the brazen stairs. He\r\nwas richly dressed; the magnificent guest was worthy of the splendor of\r\nthe wedding feast. He entered gracefully, and gazed curiously on the\r\nthousands who were dancing around him. His eyes fell upon the rich and\r\nvaried spoils overhanging the Hall; broken swords were wrought into the\r\nwalls like mosaics; the flags of the conquered nations were draped in\r\ntheir varied hues across the vaulted ceiling; but as he looked on all\r\nthese trophies of power, I saw him suddenly turn pale with rage, and\r\nbite his lips until the blood followed the pressure of his teeth; but\r\nthen the whirling crowds caught him in their midst--violins, harps,\r\nflutes and horns poured the reeling air into his dizzied brain--clouds\r\nof incense intoxicated his senses--piled and mossy carpets luxuriously\r\nyielded to the pressure of his feet--rainbow hues shifted gayly before\r\nhis dazzled eyes--until giddy, fascinated, stimulated, he sank upon a\r\npile of cushions, resting his hot temples in his burning palms, dreaming\r\nof snowy hands and taper fingers, of azure eyes and cheeks like rose\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nAs he thus rested, I heard the bell heavily toll one; I felt that this\r\nlong night was in its darkest hour!\r\n\r\nWhen he raised his eyes, he saw, through the long vista of the\r\nilluminated apartments, the Throne of the Splendor of the Sun. It stood\r\nabove the moving sea of dancers; upon it sat the Autocrat of Life and\r\nDeath; and above him waved the canopy of flags torn from the dying\r\nnations. The young man started, for he saw one among them dyed in gore,\r\nand tattered into rags, and from its torn streamers, drop by drop, the\r\nblood was ever falling; but no one saw or heeded it save himself. When\r\nthis sight fell upon his reeling gaze, he determined to repel with all\r\nhis force the allurements of temptation, and again his eye gleamed blue\r\nand pure as it had done in the early morning.\r\n\r\nA movement now began in the crowd. It dispersed, divided, and formed\r\ninto long lines upon the right and the left, leaving a wide, open\r\npathway through the whole length of the long vista of the apartments.\r\nThe Lord of the Palace descended from his Throne, and moved through the\r\nliving walls as if he were a God, while all prostrated themselves as he\r\npassed along. He turned not aside, but went directly to the spot where\r\nthe young man was seated. Nearer and nearer he approached, wondrously\r\nbeautiful and strong. The young man rose and looked boldly into his\r\neyes. The Master of Life and Death did not frown upon him, but said\r\ngently: 'Come, let us take a stroll together; I will show you the\r\nwonders of my Palace!'\r\n\r\nThe youth stood as if transfixed to the spot, but the Lord of Life and\r\nDeath drew closer to him, stooped and pressed a kiss on his brow, and\r\nled him away with easy grace.\r\n\r\nAlthough he seemed to see the coffin of the murdered Mother ever winding\r\non before him, the young man accompanied the Monarch. His arm trembled\r\nwith the quick beating of his boiling blood as it lay on the hard one of\r\nthe Autocrat, who, thunder as he might to the bowing throng prostrating\r\nthemselves before him, continued to speak in soft tones and with a\r\nnoble, courteous air to his present companion. He spoke of the past, he\r\nuttered without trembling even the name of the murdered Mother, as if\r\nher assassination did not weigh upon his conscience. He did not seem to\r\nhave the least doubt that she was really dead, vanished forever from the\r\nface of the earth. He artfully pointed out to the young man another\r\nimmense future,[10] graven, as he said, in the Book of Fate. He painted\r\nit in the most alluring colors, awakening his young desires for its\r\nattainment; he spared no promises, and as if he held himself to be one\r\nof God's prophets, he parodied inspiration. The unhappy young man turned\r\nhis eyes toward the ground, away from the handsome face, as though it\r\nhad been that of Antichrist. Each word of the Tempter fell like a drop\r\nof poison on his heart, engendering and hatching the worms within. They\r\nwalked together through the long ranges of apartments, the close ranks\r\nof men prostrating themselves as they passed, until they struck with\r\ntheir foreheads the malachites wrought into the tessellated floor.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the other end of the Palace, the gates of bronze\r\nupon the order of the Master were suddenly thrown open, while the mass\r\nbehind, lifting their heads from the ground, looked enviously after\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n'Behold, this is my Treasury,' said the Monarch. 'Look, and have faith\r\nin the extent of my power!'\r\n\r\nThe young man looked before him. He was standing at the portals of deep\r\nmines of wealth, endlessly extended. Alas! the glowing splendor from the\r\nhills and valleys burned into the blue eyes of the young man; his pupils\r\nrapidly absorbed the molten torrents of gold and silver; circles of\r\nlight from amethyst, opal, and emerald, bent like rainbows round the\r\nazure orbs. The subterranean flames roared and crackled; the hills were\r\nshaken to their centre; the caves were heaving in their depths, and\r\nfresh, glittering, golden, diamantine lumps came ever gushing from the\r\nfused and seething mass.\r\n\r\nBut strange sounds were ever and anon heard amidst the hissing and\r\nsputtering of the boiling metals. Long cries came up as if from men in\r\nthe agonies of death; a clatter as of chains sounded from the abyss;\r\nmuttered curses; and bent and wretched human figures were seen moving\r\nover swards of diamonds and precious stones, like the dark stains\r\npassing athwart the bright face of the moon. The eye of the Monarch then\r\nflamed with wrath. Sometimes clanging their chains as they moved their\r\nfettered limbs, these melancholy figures raised to him their suppliant\r\nhands, begging with anguished cries for one drop of water, for one\r\nmoment of respite to breathe the free air of heaven. He vouchsafed to\r\nthem no answer, and with every moment the wretched and emaciated shadows\r\nfell from utter exhaustion into the molten metals seething in the depths\r\nof the mine. But what mattered that, since with every instant, new bands\r\nof living shadows, equally fettered, doomed, and wretched, arrived to\r\nfill the vacant places? The young man thought he had seen some of these\r\nmelancholy faces before in the high places of the earth, that the noble\r\ntraits once had been dear to him, but the flashes of lightning blinded\r\nhim, and the features were rapidly lost in the depths of the succeeding\r\ngloom. The roar of the seething, fusing metals deafened the sound of the\r\ngroans from the chained and broken-hearted miners. And as I gazed, an\r\nall-pervading splendor, like the golden calm of the Desert, settled over\r\nall, covering with glittering veil the anguish which had been revealed.\r\n\r\nAs this light overflowed the scene with its brilliant haze, the gates of\r\nbronze clapped to with heavy clang. The Master of Life and Death took\r\nleave of the young man, and as he departed, said: When the great bell\r\nagain strikes, be in the Hall of the Throne; thy seat at my Banquet is\r\nnext my own.\r\n\r\nAs the young man turned to move away, the throng greeted him with shouts\r\nand cheers. Many knelt to kiss his hand, because it had touched the hand\r\nof the Master. They asked him what music he would hear, and when his\r\nchoice was made, the grand orchestra rolled it forth in massive waves of\r\nsound. They bore him luscious wines in jewelled vases, kneeling as he\r\ntook the cup. He marvelled, and at first scorned the homage, but again I\r\nsaw him look proudly round him, and assume an air of command.\r\n\r\nIn a recess of the most exquisite beauty, veiled by groves of perfumed\r\nflowers, he meets resplendent groups of married women, blooming clusters\r\nof budding maidens. They surround him as he enters, greeting him with\r\nlovely smiles; and scattering rose leaves o'er him. His cheeks flame as\r\nwith fever; his blood boils in his veins; he grows giddy, faint:--alas,\r\nhe feels at last that he might find happiness in the Palace of the\r\nmortal enemy of his Mother! This feeling falls upon him like a\r\nthunderbolt, and scathes his heart. He turns to fly, but they pursue,\r\nthe perfumed wind bearing onward and wafting around him the full drapery\r\nof their floating trains of luxury. Their long ringlets kiss his cheeks,\r\nand weave their nets around him.\r\n\r\nThrough two long hours of this fitful night I watched him with the\r\nkeenest interest. I saw him struggle, confused, bewildered, reeling,\r\ngiddy, dazzled, sometimes almost yielding to temptation, sometimes\r\nearnestly imploring the Heavenly Father for strength to resist delusion.\r\nAs if in despair, I saw him hurrying through the long suite of\r\napartments in search of a sword to pierce his weak, vacillating heart,\r\nbut no arms were here to be found. Sometimes I saw him rush to meet the\r\nalluring Circes of the Palace, as if seeking their fascinations; then,\r\nsuddenly turning upon them, he would curse and insult the seductive\r\nSirens. I saw him tear from them their veils of snow, rend them asunder,\r\nand trample the costly fragments under his feet. They knelt, wept, and\r\nhumiliated themselves before him. They prayed for love, saying: 'Once,\r\nonly once, we implore thee, confess that thou lovest!' Utter madness\r\ncame upon him; electric flashes fired his veins; rapture tingled through\r\nevery fibre of his young frame; and in the voluptuous delirium of the\r\nmoment he wildly cried: 'I love! I love!'\r\n\r\nAs he spake, he caught in his arms the Houri of the foreign race; he\r\nfastened his burning lips upon her rosebud mouth; and by the magic of\r\nher breath she drew him on to the Hall of the Throne!\r\n\r\nThere sat the Master of Life and Death, with the flags and standards of\r\nthe conquered nations floating around and above him. As the youth and\r\nmaiden entered, I again heard the great bell toll the hour. Throngs of\r\ncourtiers stood around the Throne. Slowly the curtain of inwrought\r\ntapestry rose from the platina door. Those who had been waiting beyond\r\nits threshold for admittance, were summoned by the Heralds to appear.\r\nAmbassadors from the Kings of the East and the Kings of the West entered\r\nthe Presence Chamber. On they filed in long and solemn procession. They\r\nall bowed as they passed the Throne, each one depositing an urn of pure\r\ngold at the feet of the Monarch. The urns were filled with the ashes of\r\nthose who had fallen in battle, heroes killed in holy causes, patriots\r\nand martyrs from different parts of the world. The Grand Duke entered\r\nlast in the train, he was clad in the ermine only worn by Princes, and\r\nas he bowed his head, he placed the last urn on the floor. The young man\r\nstarted--the name of the murdered Mother was deeply graven on the\r\nsculptured swells. Then all grew dark before him, he saw neither the\r\nThrone of the Monarch, nor the fair girl still clinging to his arm. But\r\nhis ear quickened as his eye grew dim, and the question of the Monarch\r\nrang loudly through his brain: 'Are they all really dead, and will they\r\nrise from the grave no more?'\r\n\r\nAnd as if with one voice answered the Ambassadors: 'They are all surely\r\ndead, and will rise no more forever.' At a sign from the Monarch, the\r\ncourtiers approached, took up the urns, and solemnly deposited them upon\r\nthe columns of black marble ranged on either side of the Hall. Flaming\r\ntorches were then handed by the attendants, taken by those high in the\r\nfavor of the court, and held over the open crypt of the urn. The ashes\r\nwithin kindled, and burned with a dim, bluish flame. The pale smoke rose\r\nfrom the shrine, spread through the air, and wafted the smell of Death\r\nto the nostrils of the Lord!\r\n\r\nIt now seemed to the young man as if all he had seen at the hour of\r\ntwilight was but a dream; he looked upon these throngs as the sole\r\nmasters of the world, and on their Monarch as omnipotent and eternal. At\r\nthis moment the table of festival rose in the Hall, everywhere\r\nsurrounded by the blazing funereal urns. The maiden begged the\r\nbridegroom to take his seat at the banquet; the Master, descending from\r\nhis Throne, placed his arm in his, and led him to the place of honor, at\r\nhis side. The great bell again tolled the hour. The guests also took\r\ntheir places at the feast.\r\n\r\nDirectly in front of the young man stood the column of black marble\r\nbearing the urn containing the ashes of his Mother. And whenever he saw\r\nher holy name, his long lashes veiled his sinking eyes; but his bride\r\nconstantly recalled his attention to the blue flames of the crypt.\r\n\r\nMore and more madly, fiercely, fearfully, his reeling and wretched soul\r\nstruggled to regain its ancient faith, to return to its early hopes; but\r\ntemptation was around him; his brain was bewildered; his understanding\r\ndarkened; and madness within.\r\n\r\nHealths poisonous to his heart went round, and he was forced to drain\r\nthem in honor of the Master. An inward shivering disjointed his members,\r\nunstrung his nerves, heart and frame fainted into weakness, a dew cold\r\nas death covered his temples, and his head fell wearily upon his\r\nbreast--the walls, the floors, the ceilings, the men, the burning urns,\r\ndanced, reeled, and tottered in wild confusion before him. The murmuring\r\nvoices, the buzz of sound, the swell of the triumphant music, the\r\nstrange words of the foreign bride, mingled and boomed like the roar of\r\nthe sea in the ears of the swooning man--and so the last hours passed\r\naway!\r\n\r\nHe still lived, if life be measured by the wild throbs of the heart.\r\nLike the clap of doom the last hour struck upon his ear. He opened his\r\nheavy eyelids, the blue flames from the urns were dying out. The Master\r\nof Life and Death, graciously smiling and courteously inclining toward\r\nhim, said: 'Guest of my Banquet, the hour has struck in which thou art\r\nto swear to serve me; in which thou must abjure thine ancient faith and\r\nname.'\r\n\r\nAs he spake, he threw to him across the table jewelled orders and\r\ndiamond crosses, saying: 'Wear these in memory of me!' The Herald then\r\ndrew near, and read to him from the Black Book the form of abjuration.\r\nThe agonizing and swooning man mechanically repeated the words one by\r\none after him, not even hearing the sound of his own voice. His head had\r\nfallen on the bosom of his bride, his lips still moved, but his eyes\r\nwere glaring in the whiteness of death--and so he uttered all the\r\nprescribed words until the very last was said!\r\n\r\nScarcely had he finished, when the Master of Life and Death arose and\r\nsaid: 'Servant of my servants art thou now--beware! shouldst thou prove\r\nfalse to thy oath, the rope of the hangman surely awaits thee.' Then he\r\nbroke into a loud, coarse laugh of triumph!\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate man raised his wretched head, and his first look fell\r\nupon the urn of his murdered Mother. In place of her name of glory\r\nanother word was standing now: 'INFAMY!' 'Infamy,'--he looked\r\nagain; he shrieked aloud, 'Infamy;' and started from his seat with the\r\nlast effort of his failing strength. 'Infamy!' shouted the thousands\r\nfrom before, behind, from either side. 'Infamy' sounded from the\r\nceilings of the Palace, the Hall of the Throne, the deep mines and\r\nlimitless Treasury! Some among the crowd hastened to greet him by his\r\nnew name, while others fastened to his garments the glittering orders\r\nand diamond crosses. Some commanded him to bow before them, while others\r\nordered him to trample under foot the still smouldering ashes of his\r\nMother!\r\n\r\nThat thought sent the blood back in hot torrents to his heart. He broke\r\nthrough the surrounding throng, rushed on, fled from the Presence\r\nChamber, eagerly looking for his bride. He saw her leaning on the arm of\r\nanother, mocking and jeering with the rest. He glides on behind the\r\nstatues, steals along the recesses, is discovered, and again flies\r\nbefore the enemy. The Palace winds before him into countless\r\nlabyrinths--nowhere is shelter to be found sneers, menaces, insults, are\r\neverywhere around him--but worse than all, _the curse is now within his\r\nsoul_!\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly turns to meet his enemies; he baffles them at first,\r\nbut countless numbers are upon him. They hurl him to the ground, trample\r\nhim under foot, and pass on singing a song from the land of his Mother.\r\nAs he rises, fresh numbers assail him, he bids defiance to them all,\r\nstruggles, advances, until foaming, bleeding, sinking, he is again\r\ndriven back, again forced to seek an outlet from the Palace. Thus\r\nfighting, running, falling, fainting, he makes his way until the first\r\ndim dawn of day, and as it breaks, he falls heavily down the brazen\r\nstaircase, and rolls below into the court of the Palace. Here strong\r\narms seize him, and bear him rapidly away to the steps of the\r\nchurch--the same church which he had left in the evening twilight.\r\n\r\nIt is the hour of the young dawn, but the sun of this earth will never\r\nrise for him again! Light will awake the world, but it will shine into\r\nhis blue eyes no more!\r\n\r\nHe awakes to consciousness on the steps of the church, and finds himself\r\nface to face alone with the Wanderer. He is mute in his despair. The\r\nWanderer, regarding him sternly, says: 'In other times and scenes thou\r\nmightst perchance have been a hero, but the Fates doomed thee to heavy\r\ntrial, and thou wert not strong enough to preserve thy virtue! The\r\n_visible reality_ prevailed with thee above the _invisible_, _holy_, and\r\n_eternal truth_! Alas, thou art lost!'\r\n\r\n'Give me back my horse!' cried the young man, as life again began to\r\nflow through his veins. 'Give me the free dress of the steppes, give me\r\nmy arms, and thou shalt see that I know how to revenge the wrongs\r\ninflicted on my brethren, to redress my own infamy!'\r\n\r\nHe grasped the hand of his friend, and threw himself into his arms,\r\nquivering with rage. Far more sadly than before, the Wanderer replied:\r\n\r\n'The hour for bold and open defiance is not yet near. It is the time for\r\nsilent sacrifice. But even shouldst thou live until the Day of Judgment,\r\nthe hour of Resurrection, thy brethren will always number thee among\r\nthose who have renounced the Mother. Hark! thy enemies are in pursuit of\r\nthee, already near. Should they capture thee, thou must be the slave of\r\ntheir wills, the partner of their crimes, the sport and butt of all\r\ntheir bitter jests throughout the remnant of thy wretched life. One only\r\nrefuge remains for thee!' And as he spoke, he drew his glittering sword.\r\n\r\nThe young man understood his meaning. With dauntless courage he tore\r\naside the covering from his breast.\r\n\r\n'Strike!' he exclaimed. 'I die as a true son of the many times murdered\r\nMother--honor to her holy name forever and ever!'\r\n\r\nThe Wanderer groaned from the depths of his soul. He plunged the sharp\r\ncold steel into the young naked heart. The unfortunate victim fell\r\nwithout a moan. He fell in the first rays of the rising sun, and in the\r\nsame hour in which but yesterday, full of strength and hope, he had\r\nmounted his swift horse from the green home-turf, urging him down the\r\nhill to push eagerly over the broad steppe of life.\r\n\r\nHe fell in silence, but his dying eye again flashed forth a light\r\nrivalling the young beam of Day.\r\n\r\nThe Wanderer knelt beside him, and lifting his clasped hands to Heaven,\r\nsaid: 'O Heavenly Father! Thou knowest that I loved him better than\r\naught else on earth! As long as it was possible, I shielded him from the\r\nTemptation of Hell, and in the first moment of his fall, I tore his soul\r\nout from the grasp of the enemy, and sent it back to Thee! Save it in\r\neternity, merciful Father! Let the crimson tide poured out by me, be\r\njoined to that sea of innocent blood which is ever wailing and moaning\r\nat the foot of Thy Throne! Let it with that sea fall upon the head of\r\nthe Tempters!'\r\n\r\nAfter these words I saw him, with the point of the same sword, draw\r\nblood from under his own heart, and write with the sharp red blade on\r\nthe stone above the head of the dead: SENT HOME BY THE HAND OF A\r\nFRIEND!\r\n\r\nThe echoing steps and voices of the pursuers fell loudly on the ear;\r\nthey were close at hand. The Wanderer arose, and rapidly disappeared\r\nfrom my eyes in the sanctuary of the ancient church.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus passed and ended that one day of my vision!\r\n\r\n\r\nO Mother, many times murdered! When thou shalt waken from thy long\r\nsleep, and again rest on the long grass of the home turf, again hear the\r\nholy whispers of thy unhewn forests green from sea to sea, again feel\r\nthy youth returning upon thee, thou wilt remember thy long night of\r\ndeath, the terrible phantoms of thy protracted agonies. Weep not then, O\r\nMother! weep not for those who fell in glorious battle, nor for those\r\nwho perished on alien soil--although their flesh was torn by the vulture\r\nand devoured by the wolf, they were still happy! Neither weep for those\r\nwho died in the dark and silent dungeon underground by the hand of the\r\nexecutioner, though the dismal prison-lamp was their only star, and the\r\nharsh words of the oppressor the last farewell they heard on earth--they\r\ntoo were happy!\r\n\r\nBut drop a tear, O Mother! One tear of tender pity for those who were\r\ndeceived by thy Murderers, misled by their tissues of glittering\r\nfalsehood, blinded by misty veils woven of specious deceptions, when the\r\ncommand of the tyrant had no power to tear their true hearts from thee!\r\nAlas, Mother, these victims have suffered the most of all thy martyred\r\nchildren! Deceitful hopes, born but to die, like blades of naked steel,\r\nforever pierced their breasts! Thousands of fierce combats, unknown to\r\nfame, were waging in their souls, combats fuller of bitter suffering\r\nthan the bloody battles thundering on in the broad light of the sun,\r\nclashing with the gleam of steel, and booming with the roar of\r\nartillery. No glory shone on the dim paths of thy deceived sons; thy\r\nreproachful phantom walked ever beside them, as part of their own\r\nshadow! The glittering eye of the enemy lured them to the steep slopes\r\nof ice, down into the abyss of eternal snow, and at every step into the\r\nfrozen depths, their tears fell fast for thee! They waited until their\r\nhearts withered in the misery of hope long deferred; until their hands\r\nsank in utter weariness; until they could no longer move their emaciated\r\nlimbs in the fetters of their invisible chain; still conscious of life,\r\nthey moved as living corpses with frozen hearts--alone amidst a hating\r\nPeople--alone even in the sanctuary of their own homes--alone forever on\r\nthe face of the earth!\r\n\r\nMy Mother! When thou shalt again live in thy olden glory, shed a tear\r\nover their wretched fate, over the agony of agonies, and whisper upon\r\ntheir dark and silent graves, the sublime word: PARDON!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMADAGASCAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 'Last Travels' of Ida Pfeiffer, published in London in 1861, called\r\nthe public attention to an island which had been excluded from\r\ncivilization for more than a quarter of a century. The great Island of\r\nMadagascar, situated in the path of all the commerce of Europe with the\r\nEast, for reasons we are about to explain, has again attracted the\r\nnotice of diplomatists, and threatens to become a second Eastern\r\nquestion. We propose to sketch the history of the island and to explain\r\nthe cause of its sudden importance.\r\n\r\nThough discovered in 1506 by the Portuguese, and partially colonized at\r\ntimes by the Dutch, French, and English, it has, up to this time,\r\npreserved an independent government; or rather, the native tribes have\r\nbeen allowed to fight and enslave each other without much aid or\r\nhindrance from Europeans.\r\n\r\nWhen England, early in the present century, began the task of subduing\r\nthe East, she found in her conquests of Mauritius and Bourbon the\r\nnatural and important links in her chain of posts. As a recent writer\r\nhas well pointed out, she has a succession of fortified posts,\r\nGibraltar, St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius, and Ceylon,\r\nreaching from London to Calcutta and Singapore. The commerce of the\r\nworld, as it sweeps by the Cape of Good Hope, is forced to pursue a\r\ntrack in which her strongholds are situated. But for the blindness of\r\nher former rulers, she would be the mistress of the Eastern seas. Two\r\npoints, however, have been left unguarded. In some trading convention,\r\nsome congress of nations, England made the great mistake of restoring to\r\nFrance the Island of Bourbon, surrendering one of the keys to the\r\nimpregnable position she held. Other reasons have prevented the\r\nacquisition of Madagascar, and it is not yet too late to render this\r\nmistake fatal to her supremacy. It is true that in case of war, her\r\narmed steamers may start with the assurance of a secure coaling station\r\nat the end of every ten days' journey, but from the Cape eastward she is\r\ndependent upon her maintenance of Mauritius.\r\n\r\nFrance has made the most of the opportunity given to her, by holding\r\nBourbon as a military colony, and maintaining a powerful fleet there. It\r\nis, however, for us to regard the interests of the United States, and to\r\nsee if any foothold can be gained for our protection. Had war been the\r\nresult of the _Trent_ affair, what would have become of our immense\r\nfleet of merchant ships which was then afloat in Indian waters? Manila\r\nand Batavia were the only two neutral ports to which they could have\r\nfled for safety; and neither Spain nor Holland would have dared to\r\npermit our cruisers to refit or to coal in their ports. The American\r\nflag would have been driven from those seas without the slightest\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the means for avoiding this disgraceful state of affairs in the\r\nfuture lie open to us now. The fertile Island of Madagascar, abounding\r\nin safe harbors, lies as near the track of commerce as do Mauritius and\r\nBourbon. It has innumerable advantages over either of these islands, and\r\nit is especially adapted to our wants. Mauritius must be weak in time of\r\nwar, because it is so entirely an artificial colony. A mere dot on the\r\nmap, only some thirty miles in diameter, it has a population of over\r\nthree hundred thousand, wholly devoted to the cultivation of sugar. This\r\nproduct has been the source of immense wealth to the island, but it has\r\nnecessitated the abandonment of every other branch of agriculture. These\r\nthree hundred thousand inhabitants are literally dependent for their\r\ndaily food on the kindness of the elements in time of peace, and on the\r\nnaval supremacy of England in time of war. There is not enough grain\r\nraised there to supply the colonists with food for twenty-four hours,\r\nand there is rarely a supply in reserve to last them for two months.\r\nTheir rice is brought from India, their cattle from Madagascar. Let the\r\nfree intercourse with these countries be suspended, and a famine is\r\ninevitable. The noble harbor of Port Louis, with its fortifications, its\r\ndockyards, and coal sheds, is a source of strength to England only so\r\nlong as she can prevent her enemies from establishing themselves in\r\nMadagascar.\r\n\r\nFrance is striving to rival and surpass England. At Bourbon, already\r\nstrongly fortified, immense artificial docks are projected, perhaps\r\ncommenced. The colony has annually a deficit in its accounts to be made\r\ngood from the national treasury, but extension rather than retrenchment\r\nis its policy. France has acquired the Mayotte or Comoro Islands, and\r\nseveral ports on the north of Madagascar. She has also the sympathy of\r\nall the creoles of Mauritius, in whose minds the English occupation of\r\nfifty years has been unable to stifle the instinct of nationality.\r\n\r\nThus the two great Western powers stand, nominally allies at home,\r\njealous and active enemies abroad.\r\n\r\nCircumstances have kept both powers from seizing the tempting prize\r\nwhich has so long hung before them. What are these two pitiful islands\r\nin comparison with the great, wealthy, and fertile island which, lies to\r\nthe west of them? In time of peace they are convenient points in the\r\ngreat lines of commerce; here the disabled vessels of all nations find a\r\nresting place. In time of war they are strongly entrenched positions,\r\nliable to capture by any nation which can secure a base for operations\r\nagainst them. Madagascar, on the other hand, stands fifth on the list of\r\nislands in magnitude, is situated in the latitude most favorable for\r\nagriculture, and abounds in every kind of material wealth. A harbor on\r\nits coast, with the whole island as a depot from whence supplies can be\r\ndrawn, would be a source of strength more than sufficient to\r\ncounterbalance the works of half a century's growth at Mauritius. We\r\nhave only to see, therefore, if such a concession can be obtained for\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nWe have said that repeated and ineffectual attempts were made to subdue\r\nand colonize the island. Numerous tribes, of widely varying origin,\r\npeople the island, some black as the blackest negro, others of the Malay\r\nor Arab type. For centuries they had been engaged in domestic wars, when\r\nin 1816 the English Government agreed to recognize the chief of one\r\ntribe as king of the island, on condition that he would suppress the\r\nforeign slave trade.\r\n\r\nThe chief thus selected was Radama, king of the Hovas, a tribe occupying\r\nthe centre of the island, and the one which ranked highest in the scale\r\nfor intelligence. It is believed that this race, presenting so many\r\ncharacteristics of the Malays, is the result of some piratical colony\r\nhere, established by chance or the desire of conquest. That the Hovas\r\npossess a high degree of intelligence, and are capable of as much\r\nculture as the Japanese or Mavris, is indisputable.\r\n\r\nThanks to the muskets and military instructors with which England\r\nprovided him, Radama was enabled to extend his conquests in every\r\ndirection. He was indeed fitted to be a ruler, and, a savage Napoleon,\r\nhe devoted as much time to improvement of his subjects as he did to the\r\nincrease of his territories. Though not a convert, he allowed the\r\nmissionaries to preach the gospel, to reduce the Hova language to\r\nwriting, and to translate the Bible. He permitted them to establish\r\nschools, to import printing presses, to instruct his people in\r\nagriculture and mechanics. They rapidly availed themselves of the\r\nopportunity, and with mines of coal, iron, and copper in abundance, they\r\nbecame skilful artificers.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Radama died in 1828, in the prime of life; and, by an\r\nintrigue in his harem, a concubine, Ranavalo, was proclaimed Queen of\r\nMadagascar. The advance had been too rapid, and, as in Japan, there was\r\na large party of conservatives anxious to return to the old regime. The\r\nnew queen dissembled for a few years, but finally expelled the\r\nmissionaries in 1835. Idolatry was again resumed, and Christianity\r\nstifled. A certain amount of commerce was allowed with Europeans, but\r\nunder severe restrictions. So necessary to the existence of the\r\nneighboring colonists was the supply of food, that when in 1844 the\r\ntrade was forbidden, the English Government was obliged to yield. The\r\ndifficulty arose from the fact that an English vessel, the 'Marie\r\nLaure,' kidnapped some of the Malagash. The Hovas seized one of the\r\ncrew, and then declared non-intercourse. In 1845, one English and two\r\nFrench men-of-war attacked Tamatave, but were repulsed with considerable\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nFinally the matter was settled by the payment of $15,000 to the queen as\r\nan indemnity, and this sum, raised by the contributions of the merchants\r\nof Port Louis, was paid with the consent of the English Government.\r\n\r\nUntil 1861, there was no change in the position of affairs, except one\r\nincident, which Madame Pfeiffer records. In 1831, a certain M. Laborde,\r\nshipwrecked on the coast, was carried as a prisoner to the capital,\r\nwhere he was kept in an honorable captivity. He taught the natives the\r\nart of casting cannon and manufacturing gunpowder, and acquired a\r\nconsiderable property. In 1855, he was joined by M. Lambert, a\r\nFrenchman of wealth, and they became the favorites of the Prince Rakoto.\r\nThis son of the queen was at the head of the liberal party, as his\r\ncousin, Ramboasalama, was of the conservative. The latter, nephew of the\r\nqueen, and brother-in-law of the prince, had been designated as heir\r\npresumptive before the birth of Rakoto; and he had always the credit of\r\na design to contest the succession.\r\n\r\nThe visit of Mr. Ellis, an English missionary, in 1856, was the signal\r\nfor the intrigues which were about to commence between the French and\r\nEnglish. The prince was warmly attached to M. Lambert, but the English\r\nhoped to claim him as a Protestant. Finally, as Madame Pfeiffer says, M.\r\nLambert attempted to create a revolution, seeking to depose the queen,\r\nbut he was discovered and banished.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, the queen died, and her son succeeded as Radama II, after a\r\nshort contest with his cousin. Having been on the island at the time,\r\nand leaving it in the vessel which carried the new king's letters to the\r\ncolonial governments, the writer can testify to the intense interest\r\nevinced by the French and English. It was confidently asserted at\r\nBourbon that Radama had placed the island under the protection of\r\nFrance, and that French influence was to predominate. This proved\r\nunfounded, but the court was the centre for incessant intrigues.\r\n\r\nThe new king commenced his reign under the happiest auspices. He was\r\nvery popular, and his reputation for kindness had soon caused many of\r\nthe surrounding tribes to acknowledge his supremacy. The Hovas had\r\nspread from the centre toward the coast in all directions--to the\r\neastward they had subdued the Betsimarakas; to the westward, the\r\nSaccalaves. Yet numerous tribes had remained independent, and held large\r\nportions of the coast and the interior. The cruelty of the queen had\r\nkept alive their animosity, but now they voluntarily came forward to\r\nacknowledge her son and to be received into the Hova nation.\r\n\r\nThe people already had acquired a taste for European luxuries, and were\r\ndesirous of an extended commerce. As they were rich in herds and flocks,\r\nin grain and fruits, as their forests of ebony, rosewood, and other\r\nvaluable woods were immense, as their mines yielded coal and iron,\r\nperhaps even gold, they were ready and anxious to open their ports to\r\nthe commerce of the world. England and France both recognized the king,\r\nsent envoys with congratulatory letters and presents, and appointed\r\nresident consuls. The United States alone, unfortunately plunged in\r\ncivil war, neglected the opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe king proclaimed freedom of religion, permitted the establishment of\r\nschools, established freedom of imports and exports, and granted lands\r\nto all _bona fide_ settlers.\r\n\r\nIt was with the greatest surprise, therefore, that we have learned, some\r\ntwo months since, that a revolution has taken place, and that these fair\r\nprospects have been darkened by the murder of the king. It seems that he\r\nhad made such lavish grants of land to his favorite, Lambert, that his\r\nnobles rebelled. Lambert had been sent to France to obtain the regalia\r\nfor the coronation, and had organized a great company to hold these\r\nconcessions. Whether the feuds of the missionaries, Protestant English\r\nand Catholic French, aided this, is not yet known.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, however, that the king and many of his personal friends\r\nwere killed, and that his wife, Rabodo, is the queen. She is the sister\r\nof Ramboasalama, and probably represents the party of retrogression.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, too late for our Government to recognize the ruler\r\nof Madagascar, and to obtain those indispensable advantages resulting.\r\nIn time of peace, we shall have safe harbors for our merchant vessels,\r\nand we shall open a new field for our commerce. In time of war, we shall\r\nhave these neutral ports as a refuge, and should diplomacy go one step\r\nfarther and secure us a coaling station, we shall be on equal terms in\r\nthe East with the other great maritime powers.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly no time to be lost. A single English steamer, flying\r\nthe confederate flag, can pass the Cape, can coal at Mauritius, or\r\nrendezvous at Madagascar, and could then destroy more shipping than the\r\nwhole fleet of pirates has yet done. It is at least probable that our\r\nnational vessels would be refused permission to avail of Port Louis for\r\nrepairs or supplies. It certainly does not comport with the honor of the\r\nnation to have to rely upon the churlish courtesy of England. Already,\r\ntoo, we see it announced that Napoleon will find in the massacre of\r\nFrench subjects a pretext to seize on the island. If our Government will\r\nspare a single one of the cruisers which have so uselessly sought the\r\nAlabama, it may, during the present year, negotiate a treaty which will\r\nat once advance our prosperity in peace, and increase our strength in\r\nany future war.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange, indeed, that our statesmen cannot learn that we must\r\nhereafter abandon our isolated condition. England has taught us the\r\nfolly of continuing indifferent to her aggressions in the East, in the\r\nhope that she will not interfere in the West. No blow can be more fatal\r\nto her supremacy abroad than the knowledge that we have secured a point\r\nwhere we perpetually threaten her line of communication with her\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nWe have written thus fully, because so few persons have had occasion to\r\nconsider the subject. It seems probable, from the latest advices from\r\nPort Louis, that some envoy has visited the island, but what we require\r\nis a more imposing display of our power. The new queen, who has assumed\r\nthe name of Rahoserina, is but a puppet in the hands of the council of\r\nnobles, of which Rainivoninahitriniony is the chief. Formerly all honors\r\nwere held subject to the pleasure of the king, who could degrade his\r\nservants at pleasure; but this power is now declared to be abrogated.\r\nThe powerful tribe of Saccalaves, always independent until the accession\r\nof Radama II, refuses to acknowledge his successor. It may be necessary\r\nto negotiate different treaties, perhaps, to protect American citizens\r\nin case of civil war. It is certainly most important to show the natives\r\nthat we are really a great maritime nation. The time and position demand\r\nthe employment of an able envoy, and the presence of such a naval force\r\nas may cause his mission to be respected.\r\n\r\nOur last topic is to be considered. We do not advocate the establishment\r\nof costly works by Government, or the acquisition of a colony. The laws\r\nof commerce will provide the first, if only a proper protection is given\r\nto enterprise. Let us obtain but a single port under the safeguard of\r\nthe American flag, and it will become a depot as flourishing as\r\nSingapore. Private enterprise will speedily establish dockyards and\r\nmachine shops; for not only will there be an immense legitimate commerce\r\nwith the Malagash, but the port will be the great centre for repairing\r\nand refitting our merchant vessels and whalers. The one thing needful,\r\nwe repeat, is prompt action by our Government, with the certainty that\r\nthe opportunity now presented will not return.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The latest advices from Madagascar, received _via_\r\nMauritius, throw a little light upon the revolution which resulted in\r\nthe death of Radama II. It seems probable that the late king had lost\r\nthe esteem of his people by his partiality toward his favorites, by the\r\nconcessions made to foreigners, especially to M. Lambert, and by his\r\nvacillating course in religious matters. His private life was such as to\r\nrender it highly improbable that he had become a Christian; yet Mr.\r\nEllis, the English missionary, exercised a great control over him.\r\n\r\nThe late queen was buried at Ambohimanga, a little village where there\r\nwas a temple devoted to the chief idol. It seems that her son had\r\npromised to keep this spot sacred from the intrusion of the\r\nmissionaries. Mr. Ellis most imprudently determined to preach there, and\r\nthough driven away once, obtained troops from the king, and succeeded in\r\na second attempt.\r\n\r\nAs the nobles and the population were almost unanimously in favor of\r\nidolatry, this course gave cause for great dissatisfaction. The more\r\ndevout, assembling near the capital, held daily meetings, and a disease\r\ncalled ramanenra--a sort of nervous affection, such as has too often\r\naccompanied revivals in Christian countries--appeared among them. The\r\nnobles confederated under the lead of the commander-in-chief,\r\nRainivoninahitriniony, and remained aloof from supporting the king.\r\nFinally, the king published a mysterious law, allowing individuals or\r\ntribes to fight in the presence of witnesses--a law supposed by the one\r\nparty to encourage assassination, and by the other to tend to the\r\nextirpation of the Christians.\r\n\r\nThe prime minister, in a letter written in English, explains the last\r\nscene thus: On the 8th May, the chief officers requested the repeal of\r\nthese laws; the king refused; and the tenth day, a public tumult\r\nresulted in the slaughter of the Menamaso, or native favorites of the\r\nking. On the 12th May, the leaders, afraid to pause, strangled the king,\r\nand proclaimed Rabodo queen, under the name of Rahoserina.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that no foreigner was injured; but the nobles have taken\r\nan important step in proclaiming the new queen as direct successor of\r\nRanavalo--thereby ignoring the reign of Radama II. As the fundamental\r\nrule of the Hovas had been that the title to all land was in the\r\nsovereign and inalienable, the grants to Lambert and others are held to\r\nbe void. We believe this has not been officially stated, but Commodore\r\nDupré, who negotiated the treaty between France and Radama, says that\r\nthe treaty was almost unanimously rejected by the great council of\r\nnobles, and was accepted solely by the king.\r\n\r\nThe last advices, 6th September, from Port Louis, are that the French\r\nfleet at Tamatave maintains a semi-warlike attitude toward the Hovas,\r\nnot landing nor recognizing the authorities. Rumors are rife of the\r\nintentions of the French Government to seize Tamatave, and apply other\r\ncoercive measures, unless the former treaty is carried into effect.\r\n\r\nThe case seems to stand thus: The emperor, availing of the weakness of\r\nRadama II for his favorite Lambert, concluded a treaty, by which the\r\nking was to entirely alter the laws of the kingdom, and to give the\r\nFrench a controlling influence in the Indian Ocean. The people have\r\ndeposed their ruler, and refuse to be bound by arrangements made by his\r\nwill alone. Under ordinary circumstances, Napoleon would hardly brave\r\nthe anger of England in a matter in which the latter has so much at\r\nstake. The prize, however, is well worth the effort. Any European nation\r\nobtaining sole possession of Madagascar dominates the East. It is surely\r\ntime for our Government to awake to the importance of the steps now\r\nbeing taken. It is not a time when the interests of the country can be\r\nintrusted to the efforts of a consul or any inferior naval officer. We\r\nought to send an envoy with powers to negotiate a treaty, and with such\r\na fleet as will insure a respectful attention to our demands. The number\r\nof American vessels which frequent the coasts of Madagascar is a\r\nsufficient reason for us to interfere, without regard to the vastly\r\ngreater interests which demand that this island shall not become a\r\nFrench colony. Our prediction that the confederate pirates would soon\r\nsweep the Indian Ocean of our richly laden India-men seems in a fair\r\nway to be accomplished; and where, save by the contemptuous forbearance\r\nof England and France, can our cruisers find a port for supplies,\r\nrepairs, or information?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VIGIL WITH ST. LOUIS.\r\n\r\n  [Greek: \"Cheires men hagnai, phrên d' echei miasma ti.\"]\r\n\r\n  EURIPIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  O Friend, thy brow is overcast; but haply for thy grief,\r\n  Though all untold, a spell I hold to work a swift relief,--\r\n  A hallowed spell;--no rites we need that shun the light,\r\n  Thy taper trim; for we must read some dark old words to-night.\r\n  For I will, shall I?--from their graves call up the holy dead,\r\n  More mighty than the living oft such soul as thine to aid.\r\n  From Fear and Woe, through fears and woes like thine, they won release,\r\n  And through our still confronting foes once fought their way to peace.\r\n  'Twixt woe and weal, a balm to heal our every wound they found,\r\n  An outlet for each pool of strife, that whirls us round and round.\r\n  And if perhaps their childish time discerned not all aright,--\r\n  While Fancy her stained windows reared between them and the light,--\r\n  That in these clearer latter days 'tis given to thee to know,\r\n  Then seek the spirit they received, and bid the letter go.\r\n  Thy heart unto its Lord unlock; and shut thy closet's door.\r\n  The holy water of thy tears drop on the quiet floor.\r\n  Unclasp the old brown tome.

Some resting place is there\r\n  Worn,--as amid the rushy marsh by stag that made his lair,--\r\n  Worn just beneath yon carven form, that bends in pain and love,\r\n  As if to bless, from its high place, and almost seems to move,\r\n  While round it in the wind of night the arras swells and swings,--\r\n  The viceroy's of the universe, son of the King of kings.\r\n  For Louis loves to leave his court, and lay aside his crown,\r\n  And to a mightier Prince than he to bow in homage down.\r\n  In this great presence learns the king peace, truth, and lowlihead;\r\n  Here learns the saint the majesty no earthly power to dread.\r\n  But now the king's mute voice it rings, and through the shades doth call:\r\n  'Ho, Sire de Jonville, come to me, my doughty seneschal!'\r\n  The rafters feel the tramp of steel; and by the monarch stand\r\n  Again the feet that by him stood far in the Holy Land.\r\n  'O Sire de Jonville,' to his friend and servant Louis saith,\r\n  'Hold fast and firmly to the end the jewel of thy faith.\r\n  Strong faith's the key of heaven; and once an abbot taught to me,\r\n  If will is good, though faith is weak, shall faith accepted be.\r\n  This tale he told[11]:\r\n\r\n               A Master old,--Master of Sacred Lore,--\r\n  Of life unsmirched, once came to him in straits and travail sore,\r\n  'What wouldst thou, Master?--What the grief that makes thee peak\r\n      and pine?\r\n  And comest thou to me?--My soul hath often leaned on thine!'\r\n  'Let each co-pilgrim lean in turn on each,' in anguish meek,\r\n  With tongue that clave unto his mouth, the Master then did speak;\r\n  But when the abbot led him in and lent his pitying ears,\r\n  Then tears came fast instead of words; words could not come for tears.\r\n  'O brother, weep no more; but speak, and banish thy dismay.\r\n  Of man is guilt; but grace is God's, that purgeth guilt away.\r\n  If all our little being's bound were filled and stuffed with sin,\r\n  'Twere nothing to the holiness His mighty heart within;\r\n  And in this wilderness of life there's no such crooked road,\r\n  But from it may a path be found straight to the throne of God.\r\n  The penitent that mourns like thee, that path will surely take.\r\n  What needeth but to own thy sin and straight thy sin forsake?'\r\n  'Yet must I weep. Mine inward plight is one that stands alone.\r\n  The outward ill the tempted wight may do or leave undone;\r\n  But when I to the altar go, to eat the sacred bread\r\n  And gaze upon the blood divine, that for us all was shed,\r\n  Still Satan stirreth up in me a heart of unbelief!--\r\n  This guilt must sure unmeasured be, save haply by this grief!'\r\n  The abbot's brows were sternly bent an instant on his guest:\r\n  'Dost thou--thou dost not, sure!--invite this traitor to thy breast?'\r\n  'The livelong day, though sore assailed, true watch and ward I keep,--\r\n  Keep vigils long as flesh can bear,--but in my helpless sleep--\r\n  Thronged heaven, canst thou no angel spare, to sit by me by night\r\n  And drive away the hell-sent dreams, that drive me wild with fright?--\r\n  I seem to spill with frantic hands, and spurn the piteous blood,\r\n  To trample on the blessed bread, and spit upon the rood!'\r\n  The abbot's cheer grew calm and clear: 'Now, Master, tell me true:\r\n  For aught that Satan proffers thee, such trespass wouldst thou _do_?'\r\n  'From his poor thrall he taketh all, and offers nought instead.\r\n  The Father's grace,--the Son's mild face,--are all I crave,' he said.\r\n  'For any threat of any fate, wouldst follow his commands?'\r\n  'The fiery stake I'd rather make my portion at his hands!'\r\n  The abbot's mien was bright, I ween, as 'twere a saint's in bliss:\r\n  'O fiend, 'tis well to seek for hell so pure a gem as this!\r\n  O cunning foe, that round dost go these heavenward birds to snare,\r\n  When every brighter line is vain, wouldst tempt them with despair?\r\n  Bethink thee, Master. War doth rage 'twixt Britain's king, we know,\r\n  And ours. Now tell me unto whom most thanks our liege shall owe,\r\n  When war is o'er? To him who, oft assailed but never quelled,\r\n  The castle of Rochelle upon the dangerous Marches held,--\r\n  Whose battlements must bristle still with halberd, bow, and lance,--\r\n  Or Montl'hery's, that nestles safe close to the heart of France?'\r\n  'Unto the warden of Rochelle. Thou'rt answered easily!'\r\n  'That stronghold is thy heart, but mine the keep of Montl'hery,\r\n  For He who giveth gifts to all, hath given me to believe\r\n  So steadfastly, that strife like thine my wit can scarce conceive.\r\n  From th' Enemy God keepeth me,--He knows my weaker strength,--\r\n  But suffers thee assayed to be for higher meed at length.\r\n  Then let us at our different posts His equal mercies own;\r\n  But they the sharpest thorns who bear may wear the brightest crown.'\r\n  Beside the kneeling penitent the abbot bent his knee,\r\n  Sent his own praise and prayers to heaven forth on an embassy,\r\n  Then raised him up, and saw that God had sent him answering grace;\r\n  The shadow of the Enemy had left his heart and face.\r\n  Calmly as warily he walked his fellow men beside,\r\n  A good, grave man. 'Tis said, at last a happy man he died.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION NOT TO BE MAINTAINED BY FORCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enemies of our cause in Europe seem to have settled in their own\r\nminds the certainty of a final separation of the American States.\r\nCompelled though they may be, reluctantly to admit the superiority of\r\nour resources and the immense advantages we have recently gained over\r\nthe conspirators, they yet adhere with singular tenacity to the belief\r\nthat all our victories will be barren, and that all our vast\r\nacquisitions of Southern territory will not avail for the ultimate\r\nrestoration of the Union. Though the domain originally usurped by the\r\nrebellion is already sundered by our possession of that great\r\ncontinental highway, the Mississippi river, and though no shadow of hope\r\nremains that the enemies of the Union will ever be able to recover it;\r\nthough the recent boundless theatre of hostilities is gradually\r\ncontracting, and the resources of the rebellion are rapidly melting\r\naway, until there remains no longer any doubt of our ultimate and even\r\nspeedy success in crushing the wasted armies of the desperate foe; and\r\nthough the boundaries of the boasted confederacy are uncertain,\r\never-shifting, and mystical, while whole populations of recovered\r\nregions of country hail the advent of our conquering flag with streaming\r\neyes and shouts of joy; yet our jealous friends across the water, in the\r\nvery act of acknowledging all this, never fail to assert, with the\r\nutmost vehemence, that in spite of all our military advantages, the\r\nUnion is still irrecoverably destroyed. There is something remarkable in\r\nthis persistent opinion, which, through all the changes of condition\r\nexhibited by the hostile parties in our struggling country, continues to\r\npossess the mind of British statesmen with unshaken firmness. If they\r\nundertake to justify their hasty recognition of the rebels as\r\nbelligerents, and to vindicate their alleged impartial neutrality, they\r\ntake apparently peculiar delight in fortifying themselves with the\r\ndeclaration that the Union is effectually broken, and can never be\r\nrestored. It is necessary to throw the shield of this cherished\r\nanticipation back on the unfriendly acts they have perpetrated against\r\nus, in order fully to justify their conduct to themselves. If the\r\nrebellious States should indeed be compelled to acknowledge the\r\nauthority of the Federal Government, and should return again to their\r\nposition in the Union, the hostile cruisers which have been fitted out\r\nin England to harass our commerce, would occasion some unpleasant\r\nnegotiations, and perhaps some costly responsibilities. To brush these\r\nall aside, and at the same time to get rid of a troublesome rival in\r\ncommerce and manufactures, by the final separation of the Union, is, to\r\nthem, on all accounts, 'a consummation most devoutly to be wished.' They\r\nmay yet have to learn, through the experience of their Southern friends,\r\nthat\r\n\r\n  'The ample proposition, that hope makes\r\n   In all designs begun on earth below,\r\n   Fails in the promised largeness.'\r\n\r\nBut perhaps, after all, it is we, ourselves, who are the victims of\r\ndelusive hope in reference to the destiny of our noble Union. Possibly\r\nour disinterested friends across the water, calmly looking on from a\r\ndistance, may be better able to understand the tendency of events, and\r\nto foresee the issue of the mighty civil contest which rages around us.\r\nThey are not at all involved in the awful passions which the war has\r\nengendered in our bosoms, and thus, cool and deliberate, from the great\r\naltitude of their assumed moral serenity and disinterestedness, they may\r\nin reality behold the division of our country already accomplished,\r\nwhatever may be the result of our grand strategy and our bloody battles.\r\n\r\nLet us open our eyes fully, and look this matter dispassionately in the\r\nface. Let us try and ascertain whether we are in reality deceiving\r\nourselves and waging a vain and fruitless war against our exasperated\r\nand misguided brethren of the South. We know they have instituted a\r\ncauseless rebellion, which has brought unnumbered woes upon our common\r\ncountry. But if we cannot restore the Union, and reëstablish one great\r\nand powerful nationality within the magnificent domain which we possess\r\nas it was when this unhappy war began, then surely we are wasting our\r\nblood and treasure--our lives and fortunes--with the most wanton and\r\nwicked disregard of the sufferings and sacrifices of the people. If the\r\nwar is to accomplish nothing, then the sooner it is closed the better.\r\nIf the Union is indeed irrevocably broken and gone forever, let us, by\r\nall means, hasten to arrange the terms of honorable peace, and stop the\r\neffusion of blood at the earliest practicable moment. Unless we can\r\nassure ourselves that there is some object to be gained, commensurate in\r\nvalue with all the terrible sacrifices we are daily making, it is only\r\ncriminal stubbornness and passion which induce us to continue the awful\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nOf one thing, at least, there is no shadow of doubt. The people of the\r\nloyal States, who, by an immense majority, have just emphasized their\r\ndetermination to sustain the war, are firmly convinced that they are not\r\nlaboring and suffering in vain. It is no spasmodic impulse of blind\r\npassion, or even of useless though just resentment against wrong, which\r\nimpels them, after nearly three years of ruinous war, to redouble their\r\nsublime efforts to conquer the treason that still obstinately resists\r\nthe lawful authority of the Union. Whatever else may be truly said of\r\nthis great conflict and its terrible results, it cannot be questioned\r\nthat the people of the loyal States are profoundly impressed with the\r\ninestimable value of their free institutions and of the constitutional\r\nintegrity and unity of the Government which shall administer them on\r\nthis continent. They have faith in the exalted destiny of their country.\r\nThey at least do not admit that the Union is irrecoverably lost; on the\r\ncontrary, they believe, with a religious sincerity, which no temporary\r\ndisaster can shake, in the certainty of its speedy restoration. This\r\nearnest faith is not merely the result of education and national\r\nprejudice. While it is to some extent an instinctive or intuitive\r\ninsight of the American people, prophetically anticipating the future,\r\nit is also a matter of sober judgment, founded upon the most substantial\r\nand convincing reasons.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the loyal people of the United States plainly see\r\nthat the true interests of both sections demand the restoration of their\r\nold connection under one free and benign Government. Having originated\r\nand developed a mighty republican government, until it became\r\ncontinental in its dimensions, and having through it achieved results\r\nunexampled in history, with the promise of future prosperity\r\nimmeasurably grand and imposing, the lovers of the Union would hold\r\nthemselves utterly unworthy of their lineage and of their inherited\r\nfreedom, if they could consent, in the presence of whatever dangers and\r\ndifficulties, to see the glorious destiny of their country defeated.\r\nThey would justly consider themselves traitors, not only to their\r\ncountry, but also to the highest interests of humanity itself; and they\r\nwould feel the ineffable shame of imprinting the brand of their\r\ndegradation upon their own brows. Partakers of the noblest forms and the\r\nmost precious blessings of liberty, under a splendid, powerful, and\r\ngrowing nationality, they are too conscious of the dignity and glory of\r\nthe American character ever to be willing to fall from that high estate\r\nwithout a struggle which shall fully demonstrate their lofty patriotism\r\nand their intelligent appreciation of the priceless political and social\r\nstructure they seek to preserve for the benefit of the whole country and\r\nof the world. The history of Europe, and indeed the experience of the\r\nentire human race, have taught them the immense value of a mighty\r\ncontinental organization, such as our Union has hitherto established.\r\nSolemnly impressed with this great lesson of human history, they will\r\nnever consent to see their country broken up into discordant fragments.\r\nAs they plainly foresee the tremendous and ever-increasing evils of such\r\na national disintegration, they have deliberately come to consider the\r\nworst calamities of this war as mere dust in the balance when weighed\r\nagainst them. It is this awful picture of bloody conflicts, perpetuated\r\nthrough coming generations, wasting the substance and paralyzing the\r\nfruitful energies of this mighty nation, perhaps for centuries to\r\ncome--it is this vista of inevitable calamities and horrors, which\r\nreconciles the loyal people of North America to the dreadful war in\r\nwhich they have been so earnestly engaged for the last two years and\r\nmore. They feel the inspiration of a sacred cause, the mighty impulse of\r\nan idea as grand as their cherished hopes for their country, and as\r\nimmense as the interests of all humanity. They hear the mute appeals of\r\na swarming posterity, gathered from all nations in pursuit of freedom,\r\nprogress, and happiness, and they know that these countless millions\r\nwill justly hold them responsible for the deeds of the present momentous\r\nhour. Is it strange that, penetrated and nerved with the high motives to\r\nbe derived from these solemn considerations, the American people are\r\nprepared to accept the responsibilities of the great occasion, and even\r\nto wade through blood for the realization of the grandeur of those human\r\nhopes which are now intrusted to their keeping? One nation--one\r\ngovernment--one universal freedom within those imperial boundaries which\r\nhave heretofore been the theatre of our glorious achievements as a\r\npeople! This is the grand thought of the Union men of America. This is\r\nthe principle of their organization, and this it is which gives them\r\nhope, and strength, and courage. What weakness, what degeneracy, what\r\ndwindling of power for good and retrogression of thought and aim would\r\nbe the consequence of permanent division! What a lamentable fall in our\r\nposition among the nations of the earth, and what a diminution of our\r\ncapacity for progress among ourselves and for usefulness to mankind! It\r\nis our duty and our destiny to develop all the physical resources of the\r\ncontinent--to stimulate its agricultural capabilities--to bring to light\r\nits boundless mineral treasures--to pierce its mountains and level its\r\nvalleys--to control its mighty floods--and to make it worthy to be the\r\nseat of human freedom and of human empire. Nor is it less our destiny to\r\nbuild up a moral and social power and a political organization, which\r\nshall shed abroad a new and glorious light, beaming with immortal hopes,\r\nand penetrating to the farthest verge of the habitable globe. Nature, in\r\nevery form of benignant usefulness and unequalled grandeur, invites us\r\nto this tremendous task. The loyal people of the nation have not been\r\ninsensible to these mystic calls and the noble anticipations growing out\r\nof them, fraught as they are with the happiness and progress of the\r\nhuman race. They have projected works of the most gigantic proportions,\r\nnor, although they are conscious that union is indispensable to their\r\nsuccess, have they hesitated to begin them, with all the high confidence\r\nnecessary to their completion. Even amid the perils and the vast\r\nexpenditures of civil war have they embarked in the grand enterprise of\r\nuniting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by a continental highway, equal\r\nin its cost and its importance to the power and resources of a mighty\r\nempire. Vast internal streams and lakes call for union by canals, which\r\nshall typify the union of hearts and of interests destined to bind\r\ntogether millions of freemen, whose connection of brotherhood and\r\nnational unity shall be as lasting as the perpetual flow of our mighty\r\nrivers, and as full of blessings as our great lakes are of their pure\r\nand crystal waters. The agitation of these momentous schemes, under\r\nexisting circumstances, is a phenomenon indicating a consciousness of\r\nsecurity and of vast power in the community, which, at the same time\r\nthat it is engaged in the perilous and bloody work of preserving the\r\nUnion, is preparing to perform the most important duties appertaining to\r\nthe nation in the hour of its most perfectly established and permanent\r\nauthority. It is the instinct of the national destiny working out its\r\nends in spite of the difficulties and dangers of the hour. It is the\r\nprophetic vision of the popular mind, unconsciously preparing for a\r\ngreat future not yet visible to the natural eye, but which the\r\nprovidence of God, in its own good time, will verify to the firm and\r\ncourageous hearts of our people.\r\n\r\nThe loyal people of our country, those who are determined to restore the\r\nUnion, are well aware that it cannot be maintained by force. That great\r\npolitical organization was voluntary in its origin, based on the consent\r\nof the governed; and it has been upheld through all its marvellous\r\ncareer of prosperity by the free and unconstrained will of the people,\r\nwho rejoiced in its common benefits and blessings. The novel system on\r\nwhich it was built, not only required the largest liberty for its very\r\nconception and for its practical embodiment, but was also admirably\r\ndevised to secure the complete and permanent enjoyment of that\r\nindividual independence in thought and action, which is the first of\r\nhuman privileges. Those States of the Union which are preëminently loyal\r\nto it, have ever cherished the most liberal principles of civil polity,\r\nand have framed their constitutions in accordance with the most modern\r\nand advanced maxims of popular rights. So far are they from any\r\ndisposition to usurp authority or to impose unjust or unnecessary\r\nrestraints upon the political action of the people, that they are\r\ncharged with the opposite fault of carrying liberty to the extreme of\r\nungoverned license. Of all the American States, these are the least\r\nlikely to interfere with the great principles of civil liberty, or to\r\nimpose an unacceptable government on the people by force. All the\r\nviolence, so far as any has been shown, is wholly on the other side.\r\nLeaving entirely out of view the exceptional irregularities arising from\r\na state of civil war, and it must be acknowledged that the social and\r\npolitical system of the Southern States is one which rests on arbitrary\r\nforce as its corner stone. It is this arbitrary and tyrannical spirit\r\nembodied in Southern institutions which has seized on the pretext of\r\nsecession in order to destroy the Government of the Union. The efforts\r\nof the loyal States and of the Federal authority in the present war are\r\nantagonistic to this spirit. Their purpose is to break down and destroy\r\nthis system of arbitrary power, which has set itself up against the\r\nUnion; and in its stead to bring into play the great principle of\r\npopular assent to the fundamental principles and conditions of\r\ngovernment. Annihilate the despotism which controls in the pretended\r\nconfederacy, give the masses of the people absolute freedom of choice\r\nunder the conditions necessary for deliberate and intelligent decision,\r\nand they will certainly pronounce for the restoration of the old Union,\r\nunder which they have enjoyed such boundless prosperity. No friend of\r\nthe Union entertains any serious thought of disregarding or destroying\r\nthe great principle that governments are only rightly founded on the\r\nconsent of the governed. But it is not every temporary aberration of\r\nthought, nor every outbreak of revolutionary violence, which may\r\nproperly be allowed to avail in changing the forms of an established\r\ngovernment. Some respect is due to obligations once assumed and long\r\nrecognized as the basis of a permanent political organization; and when\r\nthe minority in that organization have taken up arms against it, the\r\nmajority, in possession of the lawful power of the nation, are bound to\r\nvindicate its constitutional authority. If the Union cannot be\r\nmaintained by force, it ought not to be destroyed by force. The instinct\r\nof self-preservation, which is but the impulse of a solemn duty, would\r\nnecessarily and rightfully lead it to suppress the lawless force that\r\nassailed it. If this assault is wholly wrong and unjustifiable, if it is\r\nin reality as injurious to the seceding States themselves as to those\r\nwhich remain in the Union, then it is certain that, with the suppression\r\nof the violence prevailing in the disaffected region, the spirit of\r\ndisunion itself will disappear. The Federal Government cannot escape the\r\nnecessity of performing this duty, of suppressing and destroying the\r\nlawless power which assails it, and permitting the Southern people to\r\nreturn to the Union. At the present moment, in the midst of a sanguinary\r\nconflict, they are blinded with passion and overflowing with enmity. But\r\nset them free from the power which now deceives and abuses them, which\r\narrays them against their own best interests, and makes them the\r\nhelpless victims of a wicked war, and they will, at no distant period,\r\ngladly pronounce for the unity of the great nation with which Providence\r\nhas cast their lot. Innumerable indications of this disposition among\r\nthe masses of the Southern people are visible in the events of every\r\nday; and these will multiply in proportion to the success of our arms\r\nand the decline of power in the rebellion. If we are mistaken in this\r\nview, then our argument falls to the ground. If, upon a full\r\nconsideration of all the circumstances and with perfect freedom to act\r\naccording to their understanding of their best interests, the people of\r\nthe Southern States should deliberately determine upon a permanent\r\nseparation, our noblest hopes would be sadly disappointed. But this is\r\nutterly impossible. In moments of frenzy, men may perpetrate deeds of\r\ndesperation. Among the masses of all communities, some are found who,\r\nunder various impulses, will commit suicide. But the conduct of the\r\ngreat majority everywhere is controlled by the dictates of reason and\r\nself-interest. Whatever folly, even to the extremity of\r\nself-destruction, a few madmen in the Southern States may counsel, it\r\nmay confidently be expected that rational thoughts will prevail among\r\nthe masses. The paths of duty and of interest are for them the same;\r\nand, upon the whole, are too broad and plain to be mistaken. Their\r\nself-constituted leaders have already overwhelmed them with calamities.\r\nThe emancipated people will scarcely heed the advice of these, when\r\ntheir plausible schemes shall have been all baffled, and their usurped\r\npower utterly overthrown.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, very far from the thoughts of loyal men, in upholding\r\nthe Federal Government, to establish the principle of force as the bond\r\nof the American Union. They repel the lawless force which now assails\r\nit; and even while they do so, they invite the misguided people of the\r\nrebellious region to return again to their allegiance and to take\r\nshelter under the political system which is their only security for\r\npermanent peace and prosperity. The result of the contest in the\r\nrestoration of the Union, so far from establishing force as the basis of\r\npolitical authority, on the contrary, will certainly destroy it, and\r\ngive a far wider scope to the voluntary principle of consent, which is\r\nthe only solid foundation of freedom. In the normal condition of the\r\nlarger number of the loyal States, that is to say, in times of peace,\r\nliberty prevails in its broadest and most universal sense. Force nowhere\r\nholds a place in society, except for the protection of individual rights\r\nand of public order. Every man is permitted to pursue happiness in his\r\nown way, and to enjoy perfect freedom of thought, of speech, and of\r\naction, except when his published words or his overt acts are calculated\r\nto interfere with the acknowledged rights or interests of others. This\r\nis, theoretically, the consummation of the greatest possible human\r\nliberty. It provides only for order and justice, and leaves everything\r\nelse to the control of individual will and social coöperation. In the\r\npresent war for the Union, the loyal States are by no means contending\r\nfor the abrogation of this principle of liberty, but for its extension.\r\nThey desire neither to abolish it with reference to the Union, when\r\nexercised through the forms provided in the Constitution, nor to prevent\r\nits operations within the limits of the Southern States themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible that the great civil conflict now pending could take\r\nplace without causing, in the end, an important extension of liberal\r\nprinciples. These, when they once acquire a firm hold upon any society\r\npossessed of the requisite intelligence, are altogether too strong for\r\nthe antagonistic principle of force, because the latter can be nothing\r\nbut an authority usurped by the few and exerted against the many; while\r\nthe former is the accumulation of the whole power of society wielded for\r\nthe benefit of all. Obviously, this affords the only basis broad enough\r\nto sustain a social structure of any stability and permanence.\r\n\r\nUnder the operation of this voluntary principle--the principle of\r\nvoluntary consent and of universal freedom--the conflicting elements of\r\nSouthern society will be compelled to adjust themselves to each other\r\nmore wisely, and therefore more safely and profitably, than under the\r\narbitrary system which has hitherto prevailed.\r\n\r\nSome of the wealthiest men and the largest slaveholders have already\r\ndiscerned the necessities of their condition, and are fully prepared to\r\naccept the new order of things, and to make their arrangements for\r\nfuture operations accordingly. Under the law of liberty, the races, in\r\ntheir new relations, will soon find their appropriate positions in the\r\nsocial organization, subject chiefly to the natural influences of\r\nintelligence, morality, industry, and property, but not without the\r\ninevitable pressure and disturbance of traditional prejudice to hinder\r\nand embarrass the operation of the principle of freedom. It is\r\nimpossible to prevent this, so long as human nature retains its present\r\ntendency to selfishness and violence. The only alternative is to await\r\nthe soothing operation of time, which gradually softens the asperities\r\nof prejudice, and may be expected ultimately to bring the noblest\r\nharmony out of the present confusion and disorder.\r\n\r\nMany good and humane men apprehend the most serious evils from the\r\nsudden change of relations, now certain to be effected, between the two\r\nraces in the South. It will be a rude and violent shock to the interests\r\nand feelings of the whites, and will undoubtedly produce that\r\ninconvenience which always results from great social transformations.\r\nBut the anticipation is doubtless worse than the reality will prove to\r\nbe. There is a plastic capacity in human nature which enables it readily\r\nto adjust itself in new situations when overruling necessity compels\r\nsubmission. It remains to be seen what will be the results, immediate\r\nand remote, of freedom in a society composed of so nearly equal\r\nproportions of the two races. Whatever may be the mere temporary\r\ndifficulties at the outset, we do not doubt that, in the long run,\r\nfreedom will produce the best results to both. Nature is unerring in the\r\nwisdom of her general purposes and in the selection of the means by\r\nwhich she fulfils them, when left free to pursue her own laws. Whatever\r\noscillations may take place, the mean result is always good. The\r\nexperience of a single generation will dissipate all the delusions which\r\nnow blind and enrage the Southern people.\r\n\r\nWith the disappearance of the principle of arbitrary power now embodied\r\nin Southern society, the last motive for a dissolution of the American\r\nUnion will have vanished forever. Should that principle only decline to\r\na subordinate authority, with the certainty of gradual extinction, the\r\ninterests of freedom will be in the ascendant, and their influence\r\nsecure the restoration of the Federal authority. Here lies the whole\r\nproblem: let despotism continue to prevail in the South, and the\r\nseparation, with all its terrible consequences, must inevitably be\r\naccomplished; let freedom succeed, and from that moment, every hostile\r\nsentiment at once subsides, and the sundered sections, 'like kindred\r\ndrops,' again 'mingle into one.' A free community will gravitate to the\r\ncentral orb of liberty; one that is repellent to freedom will fly off on\r\nits erratic course to the regions of outer darkness, and will never\r\nreturn until, having completed the cycle of its destiny of ruin, it\r\nshall be brought back to be regenerated at the fountain of light, and\r\ntruth, and liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n_PART THE LAST._\r\n\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life!

The avenues of\r\nthe city extend for miles beyond the old landmarks. The adjacent farms\r\nhave been converted into lots, and covered with handsome houses. The old\r\nbuildings are torn down, and new and elegant ones erected in their\r\nplace. The streets are thronged with a purely cosmopolitan class. You\r\nbehold specimens of every nation under the heavens jostling the citizens\r\non the sidewalk, or filling the omnibuses which choke the way. And from\r\nthe commingled sounds of the tramp of horses, the rolling of vehicles,\r\nand the tread of human beings, there arises through the day and far into\r\nthe night a perpetual but muffled roar from this great thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a lovely October afternoon--one of those mellow days for which\r\nthis latitude is so remarkable--possessing the softness and genial\r\ntemperature of summer, without its scorching heat.\r\n\r\nThe world of fashion has returned from the Spas, the mountains, the\r\nseaside. Elegant equipages pass up and down, or stop before the favorite\r\nresorts for shopping. The streets and sidewalks are literally crowded,\r\nas if it were some grand gala-time.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly four o'clock. Walking slowly up Broadway is a person\r\nprobably about fifty-five, of medium height, inclining to be stout, who\r\ncarries his hands behind him as he proceeds thoughtfully along. His\r\ndress is particularly neat. His hat, while it conceals an excessive\r\nbaldness, permits the escape of a quantity of light hair, quite unmixed\r\nwith gray, which fringes the back of the head. At a distance, his\r\ncomplexion looks soft and fair; but, on closer observation, it has the\r\nappearance of smooth leather. Occasionally he raises his face to regard\r\na building, as if he had a special interest in so doing; then one may\r\nsee a light-blue eye, clear and icy as a fine December day, having an\r\nexpression like a flint.\r\n\r\nHe walks on. Two young men are just passing him. One says to his\r\ncompanion:\r\n\r\n'Do you know who that is?'\r\n\r\n'Which?'\r\n\r\n'That old fellow right by your side.'\r\n\r\n'No. Who is it?'\r\n\r\n'That's Hiram Meeker.'\r\n\r\n'You don't say so!'\r\n\r\nHe pauses, and lets the individual alluded to pass, that he may take a\r\ngood look at him.\r\n\r\n'I would like to have some of his cash, anyhow. What do you suppose he\r\nis worth?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, there is no telling; he is variously estimated at from five to ten\r\nmillions, but nobody knows. Started without a penny, as clerk in a\r\nship-chandler's store.'\r\n\r\nYes, reader, that _is_ Hiram. [We shall continue our familiarity, and\r\ncall him, when we see fit, by his first name.] That is our old\r\nacquaintance Hiram Meeker, who commenced at Hampton, with Benjamin\r\nJessup--Hiram Meeker of Burnsville, now the great Hiram Meeker of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nWe have devoted a large part of this volume to Hiram's early career,\r\ngoing into the minutiæ of his education, his religious training, and his\r\nbusiness life. This was not without design. For the reader, once in\r\npossession of these circumstances, had no need to be informed in detail\r\nof the achievements of those years in which Hiram worked vigorously on\r\nthrough successive stages in his career, while his heart grew hard as\r\nthe nether millstone.\r\n\r\nAs you see him now, pursuing his way along the street, he has really but\r\none single absorbing idea--ACQUISITION. True, he clings to his\r\nbelief in the importance of church membership. He has long been the\r\nleading vestryman at St. Jude's. He is the friend and adviser of the\r\nBishop.\r\n\r\nFamous is Hiram Meeker the millionaire!\r\n\r\nFamous is Hiram Meeker the Churchman!\r\n\r\nStill, I repeat, he has but one thought--one all-absorbing,\r\nall-engrossing passion.\r\n\r\nYou have not forgotten, I am sure, the early calculating policy of\r\nHiram, and to what degree he had carried it when we took leave of him.\r\nImagine this developed and intensified day by day, month by month, and\r\nyear by year, over more than a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nSince we first made his acquaintance, he has kept on rigidly. In all his\r\nintercourse with his fellow beings--man to man--with high and low--with\r\nthe sex--with his nearest relations,--he has never, no, _never_ looked\r\nto anything except what he considered his personal advantage. He is a\r\nmember of the Church; he performs certain rites and formulæ of our holy\r\nreligion; he subscribes to charities: but it is to secure to himself\r\npersonally the benefit of heaven and whatever advantages may be\r\nconnected with it. So that, where he has acted wisely and well, the\r\naction has been robbed of all merit, because there was no wise or right\r\nintent, but simply a politic end in view.\r\n\r\nLook at him, as he pushes along in the crowd! Notwithstanding his\r\nmillions, he is there a mere atom out of this world's creation. He has\r\nnot a sympathy beyond himself--not a hope which does not centre in\r\nself--no connecting link with anything outside or beyond--no thought, no\r\nemotion, no sense, no feeling, which are not produced by a desire to\r\nadvance the interests of \"_H. Meeker_,\" here and hereafter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe will go on in advance of Hiram, and enter his house before him.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the best in the city. Not showy, but large, ample, and well\r\nconstructed; indicating the abode of a solid man. It is situated in one\r\nof the finest streets far 'up town.'\r\n\r\nBefore the door are two equipages. One is Mrs. Meeker's carriage, very\r\nhandsome and in exquisite taste. The other is a stylish single-seat\r\nphaeton, with two horses tandem, and a rather flashy-looking servant in\r\ngay livery.\r\n\r\nLet us go into the house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker is just preparing for a short shopping excursion before\r\ndinner. At the distance from which we regard her, Time seems to have\r\ndealt very kindly with her. The figure is quite the same, the style the\r\nsame, the face the same, and you see no gray hairs. In short, you behold\r\nour old friend Arabella, slightly exaggerated, perhaps--but it is she.\r\n\r\nShe leaves her room, and prepares to descend.\r\n\r\nAs she passes to the top of the staircase, a faint voice exclaims:\r\n\r\n'Mamma!'\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker stops with an expression of impatience, turns, and enters\r\nthe adjoining apartment.\r\n\r\nOn a sort of couch or ottoman reclines a young lady, who, you can\r\nperceive at a glance, is a victim of consumption.\r\n\r\nIt is their oldest child, who for five years has been an invalid, and\r\nwhose strength of late has been fast declining. One can hardly say how\r\nshe would have looked in health, for disease is a fearful ravager.\r\nStill, Harriet (she is named for Mr. Meeker's mother) probably resembled\r\nher own mother more than any one else in personal appearance, but beyond\r\nthat there was no resemblance whatever. Neither was she like her father,\r\nbut more like her grandfather Meeker, of whom her uncle says she always\r\nreminds him. She possesses a kind and happy nature; and since she was\r\nstricken by the terrible malady, she has grown day by day more gentle\r\nand more heavenly, as her frame has been gradually weakened under its\r\ninsidious inroads.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Meeker came in, she demanded, in an irritated tone, 'What do\r\nyou want, Harriet?'\r\n\r\n'I wish very much, mamma, you would send and ask Uncle Frank if he will\r\nnot come and see me to-day.'\r\n\r\n'I think it very improper, Harriet, for you to be sending for your uncle\r\nwhen you are under Dr. Alsop's charge.'\r\n\r\n'But, mamma, Uncle Frank does not prescribe for me. I do not send for\r\nhim as my physician.'\r\n\r\n'It looks very odd, though,' continued Mrs. Meeker, with increased\r\nirritation. 'I am sure Dr. Alsop would not like it if he knew it.'\r\n\r\n'Dr. Alsop met Uncle Frank here one day, and they appeared to be\r\nexcellent friends. I am sure there can be no misunderstanding on his\r\npart, and papa says he is quite willing.'\r\n\r\n'Do as you like, child,' replied Mrs. Meeker. Then turning to the nurse\r\nshe said, 'You may ring, and send Thomas with a message from Miss\r\nMeeker, if she desires.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, dear mamma. If you will come to me, I will give you a kiss.'\r\n\r\nThe door closed before the sentence was finished, and Mrs. Meeker\r\ndescends the staircase, passes through the hall, and steps into the open\r\nair.\r\n\r\nAlas, what is revealed to you! Marks, grim and ghastly marks of those\r\nyears of wear and tear, which the sunlight, that remorseless trier of\r\nwoman's looks, makes quite apparent. What evidence of irritability, of\r\ndiscontent, and general disappointment and disgust with everything and\r\nall things, is revealed in those deep-cut lines and angles which in the\r\nlight of day become painfully visible under the delicate layers of Baume\r\nd'Osman, rouge, and pearl powder!\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker adjusts her veil so as to hang gracefully down to the tip of\r\nher nose, and enters her carriage.\r\n\r\nI had nearly forgotten to point out a very genteel-looking young man in\r\nblack, who wears a distressingly long frock coat and a white neckcloth,\r\nwho escorts Mrs. Meeker to her carriage, and enters it after her.\r\n\r\nArabella has not lost her _penchant_ for young clergymen, nor young\r\nclergymen for her.\r\n\r\nLeaving Mrs. Meeker to her excursion, we go into the parlors.\r\n\r\nOn one of the sofas is a young fair girl, no more than eighteen years\r\nold. Her complexion, eyes, and general cast of features, exhibit a\r\nstriking likeness to her father. She is of medium height, and her form\r\nis fine and well rounded. Add to these the adornments and appliances of\r\ndress, and you have before you a very beautiful young woman.\r\n\r\nSeated on the same sofa, and in very close proximity, is a person whose\r\n_status_ it will be difficult to decide from mere inspection. He is a\r\ntall, large, coarse-featured, but well-proportioned man, with black\r\nhair, inclining to curl, dark complexion, and very black eyes. His age\r\nis possibly thirty. He is showily dressed, with a vast expanse of cravat\r\nand waistcoat. Across the latter stretches a very heavy gold chain, to\r\nwhich is attached a quantity of seals and other trinkets known as\r\ncharms. A massive ring, with coat of arms and crest carved on it,\r\nencircles the little finger of the right hand. Every point of the dress\r\nand toilet is in keeping with what I have already described. The hair\r\ndresser has been devoted. There has been no stint of oil and pomade in\r\nthe arrangement of whiskers and mustache. In short, judging the\r\nindividual by a certain standard, which passes current with a good many\r\npeople, you would pronounce him remarkably well 'got up.'\r\n\r\nLooking at the fine and delicate-featured girl, in whose surroundings\r\nyou behold evidences of so much taste and refinement, you could scarcely\r\nbe made to believe that the gross organization by her side is to her\r\nliking. Yet I assure you she is in love with the handsome animal--'madly\r\nin love' with him, as she herself avows!\r\n\r\nThis girl is the youngest of Hiram's three children. She is named for\r\nher mother, but is called by all her acquaintance, Belle. And she is\r\n_belle_ every way--except in temper and disposition. Resembling her\r\nfather so closely, she inherits her mother's jealous irritability and\r\ntyrannical nature. She is beautiful only to look on. She is a spoiled\r\nchild besides.\r\n\r\nI cannot avow that Hiram has any genuine parental affection. He is so\r\nentirely absorbed in gathering in his harvests from the golden fields at\r\nhis command, that I think in God's providence this is denied to him.\r\n\r\n[Else he would exhibit some tenderness and love for the poor, sinking\r\nchild who is lying in her chamber, with no companion but her nurse.]\r\n\r\nBut there is that about the youngest which commends itself (I know no\r\nother way to express it) to his senses. She is fair and young, and\r\ngraceful and a beauty, and she resembles him; and he loves to look at\r\nher and have her near him when he is at home, and to pet her, after a\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nHiram is too much occupied, however, to attend at all to the well-being\r\nof his children, and his wife 'has no taste for anything of the kind.'\r\nSo, as I said, Belle grows up a spoiled child. She has never been\r\nsubject to control, and has not the slightest idea of self-restraint.\r\n\r\nThis is her second season in society. She is universally\r\nadmired--indeed, is quite 'the rage.' 'All the young men are dying for\r\nher'--I quote from the observations about town; but few have the\r\nhardihood to pay serious court to the daughter of Hiram Meeker.\r\n\r\nYet you perceive one man has ventured--successfully ventured.\r\n\r\nWho is he? I do not wonder you inquire with some degree of curiosity. I\r\nshall proceed to gratify it.\r\n\r\nThe large, dark, coarse-visaged, foreign-looking fellow, who 'lives but\r\nto adore the angel of beauty and perfection' at his side, and with whom\r\nthe 'angel' is so blindly infatuated, is Signor Filippo Barbonne, a\r\nsecond-rate performer of the last season's opera _troupe_!\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, reader, so it will be vain for me to deny it.\r\n\r\nWhat, meantime, can I say by way of explanation? I hardly know. This\r\nSignor Filippo, who is an impudent, audacious scamp, made the\r\nacquaintance of Belle two years ago, when she was a schoolgirl. She was\r\namused at seeing him follow her persistently, and at last she permitted\r\nhim to accost her.\r\n\r\nThe cunning fellow conducted himself with the utmost deference, not to\r\nsay humility. He pretended not to have the slightest knowledge who she\r\nwas. He had been seized and subdued by her charms, her loveliness; and\r\nit was quite sufficient happiness for him to be permitted to watch for\r\nher and to tread in her steps day by day. He only wished to speak and\r\ntell her so, lest she might suppose him disrespectful.\r\n\r\nThe ice once broken, arrangements for accidental meetings followed.\r\n\r\nSigner Filippo did not disclose himself, except to say his position was\r\nso far below hers, that he had but one hope, one aspiration, which was,\r\nthat she would permit him to be her willing slave forever. He asked and\r\nexpected nothing beyond the privilege of worshipping her.\r\n\r\nBut how happens it that Belle Meeker is desperately in love with the\r\nSignor?\r\n\r\nI will endeavor to explain.\r\n\r\nPossessing not one spark of sentiment or native refinement, accustomed\r\nto no restraint on her temper or will, she presents an example of a\r\nstrong sensuous nature, uncontrolled by any fine moral instincts or\r\nperceptions.\r\n\r\nThis is why in person and appearance Signor Filippo is quite to her\r\ntaste. The wily adventurer had made no mistake when he judged of the\r\ngirl's nature. Understanding her arbitrary disposition, and her\r\nimpatience of any restraint whatever, he adroitly maintained his air of\r\nextreme deference and respect, which was increased a thousand-fold on\r\nhis discovering, as he pretended one day to do, who the object of his\r\nadoration was.\r\n\r\nWhat an agony he was in, lest now he should not be permitted even to\r\nlook on her! Though assured on this point, he became reserved and shy,\r\ngiving vent to his impassioned feelings by sighs and various mute but\r\neloquent expressions.\r\n\r\nMiss Belle began to be very impatient. These sentimental meetings had\r\nlasted more than a year. Meantime, she was 'brought out.' This made it\r\ndifficult for her to keep up her stolen interviews, but she could now\r\nask the Signor to the house.\r\n\r\nTo effect this, however, she must first bring over her mother. She\r\ninformed her that the gentleman was a Neapolitan Count, who from\r\npolitical motives was forced to remain _perdu_ for a time, and so forth,\r\nand so forth, and so forth. By dint of entreaty and argument, and\r\nexhibition of much temper, Belle persuaded her mother to say nothing to\r\nher father about the visits of this Count in disguise. The truth is,\r\nMrs. Meeker had sometimes to request Belle's silence about little\r\nmatters involving some expenditures which Mr. Meeker might consider\r\nextravagant. So, with occasional protests on her part, the Signor was\r\npermitted to make his visits.\r\n\r\nBelle was too shrewd to attempt to impose on her father in such a case.\r\nShe knew she could not succeed for a minute. So the intimacy is\r\ncontinued without his knowledge.\r\n\r\nLong before this, she has been told by the Signor who he really is. He\r\nadmits his late position in the _troupe_, but has a long story to\r\nrecount of adverse fortune, and so on. His respectful manner still\r\ncontinues; it is the young lady who woos.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be done? This state of things cannot last forever. Belle is\r\nmore and more impatient. Her adorer still respectful and sad.\r\n\r\nAfter this long but necessary digression, I return to our place in the\r\nfront parlor, where the lovers are seated.\r\n\r\n'I must leave you, oh, my angel--I must leave you! It is nearly time for\r\nyour father to be here.'\r\n\r\n'I do not care if it is. I want you to stay.'\r\n\r\n'As you will, but--'\r\n\r\n'If you really loved me, you would not be so indifferent,' exclaims the\r\nyoung lady, passionately.\r\n\r\nThen follows a scene. The result is, that Belle vows she will endure the\r\nsuspense no longer. She will not ask her father's permission--she will\r\nmarry him--yes, she _will_ marry the Signor; and who dare prevent, who\r\ndare thwart her wishes!\r\n\r\nThe Signor takes impressive leave. His little plot approaches a\r\n_dénouement_. He walks with an 'air noble' down the steps, and, mounting\r\nhis phaeton, he takes the ribbons from the servant in gay livery, and\r\nthe tandem team, after some well-trained prancing, dash forward.\r\n\r\nMiss Belle is at the window, a delighted witness of the spectacle.\r\n\r\n[The Signor has got up this fine turn-out, through aid of a friend who\r\nis in the plot, especially to captivate her.]\r\n\r\n'What a singular man!' she exclaims to herself. 'How heroic he seems,\r\ncontrolling those wild creatures! Strange he should always be so\r\ndiffident when in my society. There shall be an end of this; I cannot\r\nendure it!'\r\n\r\nPresently she sees her father mount the steps, and runs to meet him, a\r\nlittle doubtful whether or not he beheld her lover start from before the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nThe greeting is most affectionate; Belle throws her arms caressingly\r\naround her father's neck.\r\n\r\n'Who is our new visitor, Belle, who indulges in a tandem?' said Hiram,\r\nturning his penetrating eyes on his daughter, but with no suspicious\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n'New visitor! What do you mean, papa?'\r\n\r\n'I thought I saw a phaeton drive from here.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, that was at Mrs. Longworth's. Such a handsome man, though, papa! I\r\nwas at the window when he got in.'\r\n\r\nHiram patted his daughter's cheek playfully, and passed in. Keen and\r\ndiscerning as he was, his _child_ could deceive him.\r\n\r\n'Where is your mamma?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Out for a drive.'\r\n\r\n'Is Gus at home?'\r\n\r\n'No, papa; I have not seen him to-day.'\r\n\r\n'Give orders to have dinner served punctually. I must go out immediately\r\nafter.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of Hiram's three children.\r\n\r\nThe individual referred to in the last chapter as 'Gus' is the oldest,\r\nand the only son. He is, at this period, about twenty-three years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nHis father undertook to bring him up in a very strict manner. He could,\r\nhowever, give none of his time to the important business of starting his\r\nson in the right path, and aiding him to continue in it. It was enough\r\nfor Hiram that _he_ was secure. He contented himself with laying down\r\nsevere courses, and holding his boy to the strictest fulfilment of\r\n'duty.'\r\n\r\nThe result can readily be imagined. The young man, as he grew up and\r\nunderstood fully his father's position, came to the conclusion that it\r\nwas quite unnecessary for him to practise the strict habits which had\r\nbeen so despotically inculcated. So he gave loose rein to his fancies,\r\nand while yet in college was one of the wildest in the class. By his\r\nmother's interposition, he was sent abroad. He came back all the worse\r\nfor the year's sojourn, and, young as he was, soon got to be a regular\r\n'man about town.' He lived at home--ostensibly; but he was seldom to be\r\nseen in the house. He had come to entertain very little respect for his\r\nfather; for he had a sort of native insight into his character. He\r\nconstantly complains of his miserly treatment, though Hiram makes his\r\nson a respectable allowance--more, I think, to be rid of the annoyance\r\nof his repeated and incessant applications, than for any other reason.\r\n\r\n'Gus' was a favorite with his mother (I forgot to say she had named him\r\nAugustus Myrtle Meeker, with her husband's full consent), and heavy were\r\nthe drafts he made on her purse. This was a point of constant discussion\r\nbetween Mr. and Mrs. Meeker. It was of no use. The lady continued to\r\nindulge her only son, and her husband to protest against it.\r\n\r\nOf late, Gus had been in possession of pretty large sums of money, which\r\nhe certainly had not obtained either from his father or mother. And it\r\nwas something connected with this circumstance which takes Hiram out\r\nimmediately after dinner.\r\n\r\nI think it is in place here to say something of Hiram Meeker's domestic\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nTaking 'Arabella' for just what the reader knows her to be, it is\r\nprobable he has made her a better husband than ninety-nine men of a\r\nhundred would have made. True, he is master, in every respect. But this\r\nis just what Arabella requires. She would have been the death of any\r\nordinary man in a short time. There is not the slightest danger of her\r\ninjuring Hiram's prospects of a long life, or of causing him an hour's\r\nuneasiness. To be sure, he is despotic, but he is neither irritable nor\r\nunamiable. Besides, he has a great desire for social position (it aids\r\nin carrying out his plans), in which his wife is of real service. Hiram,\r\nalthough close and careful in all matters, is not what would be called\r\npenurious. In other words, he makes liberal provision for his household,\r\nwhile he rules it with rigor; besides, in petty things he has not proved\r\na tyrant.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we repeat our conviction that Arabella has been fortunate\r\nin her husband. To be sure, she is fretful, discontented, peevish,\r\nirritable, cross; but that is her normal condition. At times Hiram has\r\ntreated her with severity, but never cruelty. He has borne quietly and\r\nwith patience what would have set most husbands frantic; and has\r\ncontented himself with remaining silent, when many would have been\r\ntempted to positive acts of violence.\r\n\r\nToward his sick child Hiram Meeker's conduct has been exemplary--that is\r\nthe word. He considers the affliction a direct chastening of _him_ from\r\nthe Lord; and 'whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.' He spends some\r\nmoments with his daughter daily, but he has no more sympathy for her\r\nsituation than if his heart were made of leather. Yet the best care is\r\nprovided, the best medical attendance, and everything done for the poor\r\ngirl which is proper. Hiram even overrules his wife in many things where\r\nhe thinks her severe toward the invalid, as in the instance of her\r\nwishing to see her Uncle Frank, who is our old acquaintance 'Doctor\r\nFrank,' as you no doubt understand--now one of the first medical men of\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nAlthough there has never been the least cordiality between the brothers\r\nsince the Doctor came to the city, still they have kept on visiting\r\nterms. The Doctor has taken a deep interest in his invalid niece, and\r\nshe is never so happy as when he is talking with her. He has told her to\r\nsend for him at any time when she feels disposed to do so, and he is a\r\nfrequent visitor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was late before Mrs. Meeker returned. Something occurred to give her\r\nexcursion a very unpleasant direction. She was engaged in turning over\r\nsome new silks at Stewart's, while the young clerical gentleman stood\r\nadmiringly by, when a man of very coarse appearance and vulgar aspect\r\napproached and placed a letter before her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker was prepared to utter a faint shriek, but it occurred to her\r\nthat it would not appear well where she was. The young clerical\r\ngentleman cast a look of disgust and indignation on the intruder, who\r\ndid not stop to resent it, but turned quickly on his heel and left the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker, after waiting a moment to regain her composure, opened the\r\nnote, and read as follows:\r\n\r\n     'DEAR MA: Come to me directly, and bring all the money you\r\n     can. I am in a terrible fix! GUS.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Meeker pushed aside the rich purple silk she was examining, with so\r\nmuch suddenness, that the young clerical gentleman could not but notice\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'My dear madam, are you ill?' he asked, with a show of devotion\r\ndistressing to witness.\r\n\r\n'No, oh no; but this moment I recollect I have a commission to execute\r\nfor a friend, which I had quite forgotten. And, do you know, I am going\r\nto ask you to drive home, and tell Belle not to delay dinner for me.'\r\n\r\nThe young clerical gentleman bowed in acquiescence. For him to hear was\r\nto obey. But he felt curious to know what was the cause of so abrupt a\r\ntermination of the afternoon's shopping.\r\n\r\n'I hope there was nothing unpleasant in that letter?'\r\n\r\nIt was presuming a good deal to ask such a question, but the young\r\nclerical gentleman could not restrain his curiosity.\r\n\r\n'That letter!' exclaimed Mrs. Meeker, now quite herself again--'no,\r\nindeed; it is only a word from Augustus. What a queer creature, to send\r\nit by such a horrid fright of a man!' And Mrs. Meeker laughed.\r\n\r\nThe young clerical gentleman was thrown completely off the scent. He\r\nbowed and hurried to the carriage, leaving Mrs. Meeker still at the\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\nShe looked carelessly over the different patterns, and said, in a\r\nlanguid tone, 'I think I will not buy anything to-day,' to which the\r\nclerk obsequiously assented--he well knew whom he was serving--and Mrs.\r\nMeeker left the store.\r\n\r\nHer carriage was out of sight; first she assured herself of that. Then\r\nshe called a hack, and ordered it to be driven to a distant quarter of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nThe carriage stopped at the number indicated in the note. Mrs. Meeker\r\nwas met at the door by her son, who conducted her to a back room in the\r\nthird story. It was dirty and in disorder. Bottles, wine glasses, and\r\ntumblers were scattered around, and the atmosphere was full of the fumes\r\nof whiskey and tobacco.\r\n\r\nWhat a spot for the son of Hiram Meeker to select, in which to receive\r\nhis mother's visit!\r\n\r\nWhat a place for the fastidious Arabella to enter!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT AMERICAN CRISIS.\r\n\r\n_PART TWO._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come, in this paper, to the consideration of the possible results\r\nwhich this war might have, viewed from the beginning; of the several\r\nmodes, in other words, in which it might terminate. The most distant\r\nextremes of possible eventuality were the entire conquest of the North\r\nby the South, and the entire conquest of the Southern rebellion by the\r\nNorth, so as to secure the continuance of the old Union upon the old\r\nbasis; or with such modifications as the changed condition of things at\r\nthe South might require. The supposition of the conquest of the Northern\r\nStates by the Southern Vandals has been already glanced at and\r\nsufficiently considered for so remote and improbable a contingency. The\r\ncounter supposition of the entire success of the United States\r\nGovernment in the reassertion of its own authority over the whole of its\r\noriginal domain, divided, at the commencement of the war, into two\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nIt was the general theory at the North, at that time, that the _animus_\r\nof rebellion was confined at the South to comparatively few minds, and\r\nthat the war was to be a war, not against the South as a people, but\r\nagainst a tyrannical and usurping faction at the South, and for the\r\ndefence of the people at large residing in that region. There was a\r\nmodicum of truth in this theory, but events have shown, and any one who\r\nknew the South well might safely have predicted, that the whole people\r\nthere would soon be subdued to the authority of those few. Such was the\r\nterror throughout the confederacy, and still is, where the facts have\r\nnot been already changed by the war, at the mere imputation of sympathy\r\nwith anti-slavery sentiment in any form, that a part, hardly one tenth\r\neven of the whole, in numerical strength, could successfully put the\r\nremaining nine tenths into Coventry, and bully them out of all\r\nexpression of adverse opinion, by simply threatening to accuse them of\r\nabolition tendencies. No people on earth were ever so completely _cowed_\r\nby the nightmare of unpopular opinion as the people of the South. Hence\r\nwhatever was violently advocated under pretence of excessive devotion\r\nto, or ultra championship of the cause of slavery, was sure in the end\r\nto succeed. By this process, the Union party at the South has been\r\ngradually overawed and diminished for years past, and finally driven,\r\nsince the outbreak of the rebellion, into a complete surrender to, and a\r\nfull coöperation with the rebel chiefs. Whatever may seem to be the\r\nreaction in behalf of Union sentiment, as the triumphant armies of the\r\nNorth march to the Gulf, it will be long before the real opinion of the\r\nmasses will declare itself in full as it exists. The fear of the renewal\r\nof the old terrorism, so soon as our armies shall be withdrawn, will\r\neffectually prevent the free expression of the favorable sentiment which\r\nhas heretofore existed, and still exists, as a substratum of Southern\r\nopinion in favor of the Union, unless the Northern conquest is made\r\nunquestionably final.\r\n\r\nIn the event that the theory just stated should have proved true, that,\r\naided by the presence of Northern troops, there should have been a loyal\r\nsentiment sufficiently powerful and extended to reassert itself, in the\r\nextreme South, and that, consequently, all the Southern States should\r\nhave been again represented in Congress at an early day, and should\r\nagain have taken their places as equal partners under the Constitution\r\nof our common country, it seemed just possible that the results of the\r\nwar should be confined, in their immediate action, to what may be called\r\nits educational effects upon the Southern mind and its economical\r\nbearings upon the wealth and industry of the nation.\r\n\r\nAs the other branch of the alternative, the South might have to be\r\nconquered by the force of our arms, and might remain unanimously, or in\r\nvast preponderance, disloyal and rebellious in spirit. In that event, it\r\nwould be requisite, if those States were to be retained at all as part\r\nof the Union, that they should be reconsigned to the Territorial\r\ncondition, or otherwise governed still by the central authority.\r\n\r\nIn the former of these two latter suppositions: that of the\r\nreëstablishment of the old _status_, it was foreseen by some, as not\r\nimpossible, that the final result might prove disastrous to the freedom\r\nof the North. With the advent of peace, the suspicions of the Northern\r\npeople with regard to the designs and real character of Southern men\r\nwould have been allayed. A certain appeal would even have been made, by\r\nthe suggestions of their own generosity, to the hearts of Northern men\r\nto lay aside all hostile and adverse action as against the South, and to\r\nwelcome them with open arms to all the rights and privileges of the\r\ncommon country. Meantime, a horde of unscrupulous machinators would have\r\nbeen installed in the seats of power at Washington, and would have\r\nrecommenced operations, in the consciousness of the new strength\r\nacquired in the field from which they had just retired, with all the\r\nchicanery and craft with which heretofore they had blinded the North and\r\nsecretly controlled the destinies of our Government. Southern men and\r\nSouthern women would again have been feasted and feted at Northern\r\nhotels and watering places, and again have given tone to Northern\r\nopinion, while new and especial reasons would have seemed to exist for\r\nopposing countervailing influences, as unnecessary agitation, and causes\r\nof the retention of acrimonious feeling between the two sections, which\r\nhad now resolved to live in amity with each other. In a word, all the\r\nsources of corruption of Northern sentiment, emanating from the South,\r\nwould have been renewed in their operation, with some circumstances\r\nadded, tending to give to them greater potency than ever before.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, immense advantages were to be contemplated in the\r\nrestoration of the United States to their primitive boundaries and\r\nunited power. But it was not without deep apprehension of moral taint\r\nand ulterior evil consequences, that a wise patriot could look even then\r\nto any attempt of the old matrimonial partners to dwell again in a\r\ncommon household, upon the old terms, and with no real settlement of the\r\ndispute between them.\r\n\r\nThe latter of these suppositions, the remanding of a hostile and\r\nrebellious tier of States, who had long and proudly enjoyed the dignity\r\nof State sovereignty, to a subordinate condition, had also its\r\nproportion of difficulty and danger. To carry out a _programme_ of this\r\nkind would demand a great increase of the army and navy, and would give\r\nto the military spirit and power a preponderance in the councils of the\r\nnation which has always been deemed dangerous to the liberties of the\r\ncountry. A constant drain of expenditure of the resources of the nation;\r\na continuous unrest and anxiety of the whole people; a succession of\r\noutbreaks and partial renewals of the civil war; the installation of a\r\nnecessary system of proconsular or viceroyal commissions; the\r\nappointment of men who, whether as provost-marshals, dictators, or what\r\nnot, would be in the stated exercise of authority unmeasured by the\r\ntheories of republican policy--all these were serious and threatening\r\nconsiderations, which must give the thoughtful mind some pause ere it\r\nentered upon their adoption.\r\n\r\nThere were other remaining possible suppositions in respect to the\r\ntermination of the war, of a middling character, or those lying between\r\nthe two opposite extremes. In case, without any positive conquest or\r\nsubmission on either side, the general tenor of success throughout the\r\nwar should be with the South, so that it finally behooved the North to\r\nsecure the most favorable terms, but to submit, nevertheless, to great\r\ndeductions from its confident expectations, a theory then not wholly\r\nimpossible, we had to contemplate, as one evil of the war, a final\r\ndisruption of the original territory of the United States into two\r\nnationalities, coincident, as to boundary, with the Free and the Slave\r\nStates. Except in the way of absolute conquest, the South would be\r\nlittle inclined to insist upon the addition to itself of any territory\r\nabsolutely free. We were not required, therefore, to make this\r\nsupposition any less favorable to the North than the division just\r\nsuggested; and unless, again, power had been acquired by the South to\r\nimpose terms on the North little short of those which a conqueror\r\nimposes on a conquered people, the North, within its own limit of Free\r\nStates, would be left in a condition boldly to announce and actively to\r\ndefend its own legitimate policy in behalf of the extension of free\r\ninstitutions and their development to the supreme degree of beneficent\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nBut again, it might have been foreseen that in case the eagle of victory\r\nshould perch on the banners of the North; in case our arms should be\r\ngenerally victorious after a few incipient disasters; in case our armies\r\nshould move in power southward, meeting, nevertheless, a steady and\r\nresisting front on the part of the South, making the prospect of\r\nultimate conquest remote or hopeless; in case, in a single word, the\r\nNorth should find herself in position to dictate terms short of absolute\r\nsubmission and return to the common fold, but substantially in\r\naccordance with her own wishes, the question of boundary and of the\r\nfuture policy of the new North would have become one of immense\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nHad such considerations been forced on the attention of the country by\r\nthe course of the war, it may not be uninteresting to speculate upon\r\nthe nature of the possible boundary, which a drawn game in the\r\ncontest--a possibility at least, viewed from that early point of\r\nobservation--might have imposed upon the two future nationalities. We\r\nare considering the case still in which the preponderance of advantage\r\nshould have remained with the North. It would have been, in that event,\r\nof the first importance that we should retain within the limits of the\r\nNorth all that portion of the South--by no means inconsiderable in\r\nextent--which has never been thoroughly debauched by Southern\r\nslaveholding opinion and theories of government; where the true American\r\nfeeling is still extant; and where a good degree of loyalty to the\r\nGovernment of the United States has been hitherto exhibited. Such are\r\nespecially Delaware, Maryland, Western Virginia, Kentucky, Western North\r\nCarolina, Eastern, and to some extent, Middle Tennessee, Northern\r\nGeorgia, Northern Alabama, and Missouri. An important object would have\r\nbeen, had the power of the North proved inadequate to do more, to secure\r\nthis territory within the boundary of the new North, and upon such terms\r\nas to give strength and new impetus to the freedom-loving sentiment\r\nthere extant. A second object would have been the retention of\r\nWashington City, to be used, at least for the time being, as the capital\r\nof the country; avoiding the disgrace of being driven from that centre\r\nof national authority; and to secure it on terms in respect to\r\nterritorial arrangement which should prevent it from being continually\r\nthreatened from the South. To this end, it would have been necessary\r\nthat the boundary be carried far enough south to include a portion of\r\nNorthern and Northeastern Virginia, as thoroughly imbued at that day\r\nwith slaveholding faith and practice, and as little loyal, perhaps, as\r\nany portion of the South--a region, however, which at this time has been\r\nso completely devastated by the operations of the war, that it would be\r\nreadily liable to be resettled from the North, and made into an\r\nefficient military border.\r\n\r\nIf, retaining Fortress Monroe, we should then have run with the James\r\nRiver and the line of Richmond and Lynchburg, or if, ascending higher to\r\nthe Chesapeake Bay and the Rappahannock, we were to run with the line of\r\nFredericksburg, we should reach either the Blue Ridge or the Alleghany\r\nMountains, as in the case of power on our part, we might have chosen.\r\nWith these mountains, sweeping in a southwesterly direction into\r\nNorthern Georgia and Alabama, runs the line of division between the\r\n'true-blue' Southern slaveholding opinion and policy, on the south and\r\neast, and the semi-Free-State opinion and policy on the north and west.\r\nOne or other of these mountain ranges, with their unfrequent and\r\ndifficult passes, would have offered the best natural boundary between\r\nthe two future nations, whose divergent national tendencies would not\r\nhave ceased with the nominal termination of the war to be essentially\r\nhostile.\r\n\r\nFollowing this line till we reach the Tennessee river, thence along the\r\ncourse of that stream, turning northwardly to the Ohio, or more\r\nproperly, perhaps, to the southern line of Kentucky, we exclude the most\r\npestilent portion of Tennessee, of which Memphis is the capital, and\r\nretain the middle and eastern parts, along with Eastern Kentucky and\r\nWestern Virginia. Thence passing westward with the southern line of\r\nMissouri to the Indian Territory, thence southward with the western line\r\nof Arkansas to the Red river, thence westward along that river as the\r\nboundary between the Indian Territory and Texas, to the one hundredth\r\ndegree of longitude west from Greenwich, and with that meridian south,\r\nto the Rio Grande and the Gulf--dividing the western from the eastern\r\nhalf of Texas--we circumscribe very fairly the exact region of country\r\nin which the slaveholding epidemic is violent and intense, and throw\r\nwithin the limits of the great Northern Republic all of the region in\r\nwhich freedom is already established, and all that in which, as above\r\nstated, there was still a surviving and half vital tendency in freedom's\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a boundary so favorable to ourselves, and forced by our\r\ncommanding position upon our unwilling adversary, we might have imposed\r\nupon her such other terms in relation to her foreign policy,\r\ncustom-house regulations, and the like, as the extent of our power\r\nshould have authorized. We might even have consigned the Southern States\r\nto a species of provisional and _quasi_ nationality, with the claim and\r\nexpectation of their ultimate return within the pale of the Union, when,\r\nthrough the severe ordeal of military despotism or anarchy at home, or\r\nfrom other causes, they should have purged themselves of that\r\ninstitution, adverse to all our policy, which has been the sole cause of\r\nall our woes.\r\n\r\nStill more important it would have been, under the theory of this\r\nessentially victorious position of the Northern people, that Northern\r\nopinion and the purposes of Americanism on this continent--the assertion\r\nand defence of freedom and of free institutions of all sorts--should\r\nhave been distinctly, peremptorily, and finally impressed upon the\r\ncharacter and future career of our own Northern nationality. While those\r\nportions of slaveholding territory which would still have remained\r\nwithin the Union, would have had, of course, to be treated with courtesy\r\nand consideration, if the institution of slavery were to have been\r\npermitted to survive, they should have been thoroughly made to know from\r\nthe first, that slavery among us was no longer to be regarded as a\r\nperpetuity; that it was only tolerated provisionally; and that we, as a\r\npeople, had no intention of permitting its renewed influence in the\r\ncouncils of the nation. Cut off as these States would then have been\r\nfrom the possibilities of carrying on an inter-State slave trade with\r\nthe Southern confederacy, the institution of slavery would have lost\r\nmuch of its value and potency; and allied, as those States would have\r\nbeen, as a small minority, with a country whose territorial and\r\ninstitutional preponderance would have been wholly in favor of freedom,\r\nwe might have anticipated that, if closely watched and incidentally\r\naided in its decline, the institution in these adhering slaveholding\r\nStates would have reached its term of existence at no very distant day;\r\nat any rate, that it would, from the first, have been neutralized for\r\nany serious bad effects which it might have otherwise impressed upon our\r\nhealthy national life. It was even worth reflection at that time\r\nwhether, if the whole adjustment of the future were placed at our own\r\ndisposition, there would not be less danger incurred, and more promise\r\nof a prompt, healthy, and powerful development on this continent of\r\nthose grand purposes of national existence which the true American\r\npeople have always had in view and at heart, if this plan were to be\r\nadopted, than if, on the contrary, the whole South were either\r\nquiescently, by the subsidence of the rebellion, or forcibly, to be\r\nreinstated within the limits of the Union, the institution of slavery\r\nremaining intact.\r\n\r\nNortheastern Virginia, Southern Maryland, and portions of Kentucky,\r\nMiddle Tennessee, and Middle Missouri would still have furnished\r\npestilent centres of intense slaveholding sentiment, and would have\r\nrequired, perhaps, as much exercise of vigilance in preventing their\r\nundue influence as our usually sleepy habits of inattention to such\r\ncauses would have authorized us to count upon.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual decline of this remnant of slavery in the Northern\r\nUnion, and with the thousand contingencies threatening its perpetuity in\r\nthe Southern States, after the sustaining influence of the North in its\r\nbehalf should have been finally withdrawn, the anticipation would not\r\nhave been without high grounds of probability, that the institution, as\r\na whole, would have hastened more or less rapidly to its final\r\ndissolution; and that, one by one, the States of the South, ridding\r\nthemselves of the incubus of slavery and its comcomitants--oligarchic,\r\nmobocratic, and military despotism--would have sought, for their own\r\nprotection and happiness, to reënter the original Union as Free States.\r\nSuch an issue of the conflict might at the commencement of the war have\r\nbeen looked forward to as almost fortunate, and as perhaps that which\r\nProvidence had in store for us as a people. That larger measure of\r\nsuccess, the entire destruction of slavery throughout the land, now\r\nrapidly coming to be a foregone conclusion in most minds, was then\r\nhardly hoped for by the most sanguine, although, as will appear by what\r\nfollows, that alternative was then anticipated by the writer.\r\n\r\nFinally, in case the war should have proved a drawn game between the two\r\nsections, with no special advantage on either side, some middle ground\r\nof adjustment between the two last suppositions might have been sought\r\nout, and an irregular line, running anywhere between Mason and Dixon's\r\nline and the Ohio, on the one hand, and the Blue Ridge and the Tennessee\r\nriver on the other, might have been forced upon us. In that event, a\r\nlong-continued border warfare would have been to be anticipated, with\r\ninnumerable complex difficulties from expenditure in the protection of\r\nthe irregular and imperfect boundary, the collection of the revenues,\r\nand the like.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we have chosen, in these glances at the possible\r\noutcomings of the conflict, to go back to the state of the case as it\r\nwas at the opening of the war, and to view the subject as it would\r\npresent itself to the mind of a thoughtful man then, is, that this very\r\npaper was originally written at that day, and is now only recast to\r\nadapt it to the altered events from the actual progress of the war. The\r\nboundary line above sketched, as one which the nation might possibly\r\nfind itself compelled to accept, was sketched, as it stands above, at\r\nthat time, nearly two and a half years ago; and the reader will hardly\r\nfail to be struck with the remarkable coincidence between it and the\r\npresent state of the military lines between the Northern and Southern\r\narmies; except in the fact of our actual possession of the Mississippi\r\nriver to its mouth, cutting the Southern confederacy in twain. Had the\r\ndefences below New Orleans proved impregnable, and Vicksburg more than a\r\nmatch for the strategy of General Grant, our present position would be\r\nalmost identical with that contemplated by the writer at that early\r\nperiod of the war, as one of the alternative positions at which the\r\nstruggle might at least temporarily terminate; and our present military\r\nline would be almost the same as that indicated as the halting point of\r\nthe war, then to be nominally but not really brought to an end. The\r\npages following, and until the reader is advised to the contrary, are\r\nliterally extracted from the original article, and should be read\r\ntherefore as relating to the past period in question. Quotation marks\r\nare added to aid this understanding of the subject. They indicate, in\r\nthis exceptional way, not literally the words of another writer, but\r\nthose of the same writer, upon a different occasion.\r\n\r\n'We have reserved to the last the consideration of that possible\r\noutcoming of the war which is looked upon with most dread, both at the\r\nSouth and the North; from which both sections almost equally shrink as\r\nthe possible issue; but which, nevertheless, may be forced on them by\r\nthe logic of events, and that, too, at an earlier day than has been\r\nindicated by the expectations of either. While we write, the startling\r\nannouncement is made from St. Louis that Major-General Fremont has been\r\nforced, by the threatening progress of the Southern armies, to declare\r\nmartial law for the whole State of Missouri, coupled with the offer of\r\nfreedom to the slaves. A military critic, writing from the Potomac and\r\nthe lower counties of Maryland, is urging the application of the same\r\npolicy to that region, as a means of defeating the contemplated passage\r\nof the river by the forces of the South. Whether the rumor so announced\r\nprove to be literally correct or not, it is hardly possible that the war\r\ncan continue long, and grow desperate and earnest on any territory where\r\nslavery exists, without leading to this result. Tenderness and deference\r\nare sentiments which must soon give place to the stern struggle for life\r\nbetween hostile and desperate men. Already the South has not hesitated,\r\nin some instances, to muster her slaves into armed regiments, and in all\r\ncases to avail herself of their brawny arms as equally valuable\r\nassistants in the work of fortification, camp service, and all the other\r\nincidents of war. Still further, as a great body of laborers,\r\nundisturbed by the war, quietly conducting the general industry at home,\r\nand providing the means of sustaining immense armies in the field, the\r\nslaves are, in effect, an important auxiliary of the enemy's power.\r\nAlready the Congress of the United States has passed a law for the\r\nconfiscation of all property so used, so stringent in its terms that,\r\nwithout much strain of legal ingenuity, it might be made to cover the\r\nwhole case. The threatened continuance of disaster to Northern arms may\r\nat any moment force upon our generals the military necessity of\r\ndeclaring emancipation within a given district or State, and finally, it\r\nmay be incumbent on the Government to resort to the same policy in\r\nreference to the whole South. The contest is one of life and death for\r\nthe greatest human interests ever brought face to face in hostile array.\r\nBut a single step is wanting, and we may at any moment be forced over\r\nthe boundary which hitherto has prevented it from being a conflict\r\navowedly for the utter extinction of the institution of slavery on the\r\nNorth American continent, on the one hand, and for the triumphant\r\nestablishment of the policy and power of that institution over the whole\r\nland on the other.\r\n\r\n'In case such an event as that above alluded to should occur, a new\r\ndisappointment will probably, to some extent, break upon the Northern\r\nmind. It will be found that the slaves of the South are not, as a body,\r\nso desirous of freedom, not so consciously intent upon the attainment of\r\nthat boon, as ardent philanthropists at the North have supposed. The\r\ngreat masses of that population are too far depressed in the scale of\r\nhumanity to avail themselves earnestly and at once, of even the most\r\nfavorable means which should be placed at their disposal to secure their\r\nown emancipation from thraldom.\r\n\r\n'To progress, even from slavery to freedom, is progression,\r\nnevertheless; and, as such, it is beset with all the hindrances and\r\nprejudices from ignorance and superstition which the advancement of the\r\nrace meets always and at every step. Those among the slaves who fully\r\nappreciate the disadvantages of their position, and are earnestly intent\r\nupon the achievement of freedom, are a minority--the vigorous thinkers\r\nand reformers of the slave-population. The great masses are stupid and\r\nconservative, in the midst of the evil which they endure, until aroused\r\nby circumstances or the appeals of their more enterprising leaders. Even\r\nJohn Brown, knowing as much as he did of the South and of the negro\r\ncharacter, miscalculated the readiness of the slaves of Virginia to fly\r\nto his standard, judging them by his knowledge of the readiness of\r\nMissouri slaves upon the Kansas border, who, through a few years of\r\nlocal agitation, had come to be on the alert and ready to move.\r\n\r\n'In case, therefore, of the proclamation of emancipation in any\r\nslaveholding districts by our military chiefs, it will not be surprising\r\nif, for a time, the results of that step shall seem to be feeble, and\r\nshall be disproportionate to the expectations based upon it.\r\n\r\n'The course of events will probably be this: The emancipation of slaves\r\nby the proclamation of Northern generals will be followed by a partial\r\ntendency on the part of the slave-population to flock to their camps in\r\na way similar to what has already happened in the neighborhood of\r\nFortress Monroe; and this, again, by mustering them into our service,\r\narming and drilling them as part of the regular and effective force of\r\nour armies, after the example of General Jackson in the defence of New\r\nOrleans, and other Southern generals on various occasions in the South.\r\nA step like this will be met by a nearly or precisely similar expedient\r\nof desperate necessity by the military chieftains of the South. Either\r\nwith or without the offer of emancipation, they will muster the blacks\r\nin great numbers into their army, arming, equipping, and drilling them\r\nas thoroughly as the same offices are performed for the white soldiers.\r\n\r\n'Things may seem to stand much upon this footing, and no great advantage\r\nhave been gained by the North through emancipation, until, in the event\r\nof some great battle, or successively through a series of local\r\ncontests, the blacks in the Southern army will fraternize with those of\r\nthe North, and go over in a body to their Northern allies, so soon as\r\nthe course of events shall have informed them somewhat of the true state\r\nof the case, and have given them confidence in the earnest intention of\r\nthe Northern troops to stand by them in the assertion of their freedom.\r\nA defection of this kind would carry dismay and insure defeat throughout\r\nthe whole South, especially if it were vigorously followed up by the\r\nsame policy and by adequate military skill on the part of the North; and\r\nthe result of a war so inaugurated could hardly fail to be the rapid and\r\ncomplete disorganization of the whole system of Southern industry and\r\nthe total revolution and final submission of the Southern States.\r\n\r\n'No man can exactly foresee the consequences of so great a conflict, nor\r\npredict with any certainty the course of events through such an untried\r\nand tremendous pathway; but it is next to impossible to conceive that\r\nthe Southern war-spirit could in any way long survive the disasters\r\ninevitably consequent upon the general prevalence of a claim to freedom\r\nby the slaves, upon any legal basis, suddenly diffused throughout the\r\nSouth. Should the alternative be forced upon the people of that region,\r\nof submission, or servile in addition to civil war, their troubles will\r\nthicken upon them to a degree calculated to calm their over-excited\r\nimaginations, and to subdue their vaulting ambition. Panic will come to\r\ntheir own doors with a new and all-pervading significance, such as the\r\nNorth hardly knows how to conceive. The North should abstain to the last\r\nmoment from thrusting even enemies into calamity so dire. But, if the\r\narrogance and madness of the South shall force on us, now or later, this\r\nterrific resort, the world _may_ witness, as the result of this war, the\r\nmost tremendous retribution for national and organic sin which any\r\npeople has ever yet been called on to endure. The Nemesis of History\r\nmay, perhaps, impress the darkest record of her terrible sanctions on\r\nthe page which records the termination of the great American Rebellion.\r\n\r\n'In the event last supposed, that is to say, if the war shall end in the\r\nentire extinction of American slavery, the state in which the Southern\r\ncountry, with its diverse populations, will find itself placed; the\r\nfuture destiny of the cotton-growing region, of the South generally; of\r\nour whole country, and of the continent, under this immense change of\r\nour condition as a nation, are subjects of sufficient importance to\r\ndemand, on some future occasion, a distinct consideration. Enough points\r\nhave been crowded, in this article, upon the reflections of the reader.\r\nHistory must not be too audaciously anticipated. The phases of the great\r\ncrisis, already developed and developing, are sufficiently grave and\r\nnumerous for the present occasion. Let the future withdraw her own veil\r\nfrom our eyes, while we reverentially await the revelation of coming\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n'All the forbearance hitherto on the part of the North, may have had in\r\nit an element of wisdom. It is not the object of this paper to criticize\r\nor complain of the past conduct of the war, nor to urge on the\r\nGovernment to convert a war, begun for the resistance of a violent and\r\nfraudulent dismemberment of the Union, into a war against slavery or a\r\ncrusade in behalf of human rights. There is no present purpose on the\r\npart of the writer to conduct the discussion--far less to attempt the\r\ndecision--of so grave a question of national policy at this eventful and\r\ncritical epoch in the affairs of our national life. No doubt the subject\r\nstands as yet complicated in the minds of statesmen with the\r\npossibilities of the early and frank submission of the South, and the\r\nconsequent early reëstablishment substantially of the _status quo ante\r\nbellum_; with the dread of inflicting measureless calamity upon those\r\nwho are at heart faithful to our cause in the South; and, most of all,\r\nwith the interests and feelings of the population of the few\r\nslaveholding States remaining faithful to the Union. The object of the\r\npresent article is simply to lay open the true state of the case; to\r\nreveal to the Northern mind in a clearer light, if possible, the causes\r\nemanating from the South, which have gone and which go still to the\r\nformation of Northern opinion adversely to the spirit of our own\r\ninstitutions, and begetting, unconsciously in ourselves, a secret\r\ntreasonable sympathy at the bottom of our own hearts; a sympathy which\r\nis the parent of that otherwise unaccountable tenderness on our part in\r\nrespect to the patent weakness of the enemy's defences. It is not that\r\nwe counsel, for the present, a change in the tenor of the war, but that\r\nwe wish, as the logic of circumstances shall force this question upon\r\nus, that we may come to the consideration of it, in the future,\r\ndisabused of any preconceived prejudices in favor of that which is the\r\nvital source of all the trouble which exists, and fully armed by a\r\ncomplete understanding of the subject.'\r\n\r\nSo ended the original paper, the same, with a few changes of the\r\ntense-forms to adapt it to the present time, as the Part One, published\r\nin the last number of THE CONTINENTAL, and Part Two of this\r\nseries up to this point. The document was written for publication at\r\nthat time, more than two years ago, but no periodical was found then\r\nready to indulge in such bold speculations on the future. What has now\r\nin great part become history, was deemed too audacious for the public\r\near then. Perhaps no better gauge of the progress of events and opinion\r\ncould have happened. A magazine article, rejected so recently, as too\r\nradical or wild in its prognostications, now stands in danger of being\r\nthought tame, in the light of the changes already effected. Thrown into\r\na drawer as refuse matter, it has been like the log of a ship thrown\r\noverboard, and remaining quiescent, while the winds, the waves, and the\r\ncurrent have combined to surge the vessel onward in her course; and,\r\n_hauled in by the line_ at this hour, it may serve to chronicle the rate\r\nof our speed.\r\n\r\nEvents hurry forward in this age with tremendous velocity. Great as has\r\nbeen the progress of our arms, numerous as our warlike achievements and\r\nadvantages, the real victories we have won are, in the truest method of\r\njudging, the victories of opinion which have occurred and are now\r\noccurring. Our greatest conquest, as a people, is, and is to be, the\r\nconquest over our own prejudices; our highest attainment the readiness\r\nto be just, and to act with the boldness and vigor which justice\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nTaking things as they now are, let us again try to penetrate the future,\r\nor at least to sketch different alternatives of what may happen. Let us\r\nthen try to catch the spirit of each alternative, and so be prepared to\r\ndraw from the event such of good, and to guard against such of evil as\r\neach may involve.\r\n\r\nAs a first alternative, we may now speedily conquer the South.\r\nInsurrection may spring up in the South, against the insurrection there,\r\nand in aid of our arms. New vigor and new fortune may attend our own\r\nmilitary operations; and our future military task may--somewhat contrary\r\nto our expectations, we confess--prove easy, and its conclusion close at\r\nhand. In that event, dangers of another kind, dangers already alluded to\r\nas existing at the commencement of the war, and hardly less to be\r\napprehended now than then, hardly less, indeed, than the indefinite\r\ncontinuance of war, threaten the future of our political horizon. We may\r\nsee in a few months' time the very men who are leading the armies and\r\nthe councils of the Southern confederacy again cracking the whip of\r\ntheir sharp and arrogant logic about the ears of the men who had\r\nconquered them in the field of battle; claiming to dictate every\r\npolitical measure; forcing the mould of their thought upon every form of\r\nopinion, and, by astute political combinations, wielding the destiny of\r\nthe nation in behalf of slavery and despotism, and against the principle\r\nof freedom. Do not imagine for an instant that any considerations of\r\nmodesty or humiliation on the one hand, nor of haughtiness or pride on\r\nthe other, would stand in the way of the immediate participation of\r\nthose men in our affairs. Let there be no delusions either, with regard\r\nto the ability of the same leading class of men to keep themselves in\r\nthe saddle at the South, through all political changes not involving the\r\nabsolute destruction of slavery, and the complete and consolidated\r\nestablishment of other institutions and habits of life among the people\r\nat large;--the virtual creation, in fact, of a new and different\r\npopulation, by the blending of our own Northern men and manners with the\r\nfeeble indigenous freedom-loving growth. The return of this dominant\r\nclass of cotton lords among the common masses of a Southern population\r\nanywhere, on any terms short of the utter extinction of their basis of\r\nwealth and distinction, will be the return of an armed overseer to a\r\ncowering mob of insubordinate slaves. The mere assertion of their\r\nauthority will be its instant acceptance, and the most abject submission\r\nby the people. They will only have to demand reëlection to the National\r\nCongress, and to every place of power, to be reinstated in precisely\r\ntheir old position, their arrogance and self-assertion only augmented by\r\ntheir having met and survived every disaster short of the destruction of\r\nthe source of their superiority.\r\n\r\nAlready schemes to restore the old State governments are rife, in\r\nrespect to Louisiana, Mississippi, and other of the rebel States, now\r\nagain brought within our military lines. Let this be done upon the old\r\nfooting at an early day, for these States and for the others, which\r\nunder the hypothesis now under consideration, will soon be subjugated;\r\nlet the Emancipation Proclamation fall into desuetude; let the military\r\nauthority of our army officers be withdrawn, and there is nothing in the\r\ncharacter of the Southern slaveholding aristocracy, and no other power\r\non earth, to prevent their flocking in crowds and at the very first\r\ngeneral election back to Washington, reuniting their forces with the old\r\nbody of profligate political hacks at the North, and flaunting with\r\nincreased presumption and activity the pretensions of slavery to\r\ndictate the whole policy of the land. In that event, a strong party,\r\nmore distinctively proslavery and Southern than ever before, will be\r\norganized; more openly and shamelessly than ever devoted to the\r\ndestruction of the last remnant of American liberty. Of course there\r\nwill be a new reaction against the new usurpation. The conflict will be\r\nrenewed, beginning precisely where the first war began, with the only\r\nexception that the issue will be then more distinctly understood, the\r\nconflict more desperate, and the result more definitive.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that the true nature of the case be\r\nunderstood: that this war is no accident of the hour, no merely\r\npolitical or national event even. It is a death struggle between two\r\nantagonist civilizations; if indeed one of them can be called a\r\ncivilization, and not rather a conspiracy against the very idea of\r\ncivilization. Again, the men involved in that conspiracy are not\r\n_hidalgos_, _ancien régime_, nor any of the proud aristocracies of the\r\nold world, who, when beaten, retire upon their dignity and hide their\r\ntime. They are, on the contrary, an enterprising gang of desperadoes,\r\nwho for the nonce may find it convenient to play the _rôle_ of high life\r\nand dignified pretension, but who, on the slightest change of\r\ncircumstances, are ready for any shift, any seeming degradation or\r\nhumiliation, any temporary lowering of their claims, in order to rise\r\nhigher on the next wave. There is also enough of the savage and\r\nbarbarous element of character remaining in the Southern bogus chivalry\r\nto make them, like the Chinaman or the Japanese, incapable of\r\nappreciating magnanimity. All conciliation or clemency will be construed\r\ninto weakness; generosity and forbearance into poltroonery. These are\r\nsad truths; but being truths, the failure to know them in season may\r\ncost us another and a more desperate war, with more doubtful and\r\ndangerous results.\r\n\r\nLet us once surrender, through national verdancy, sentimental\r\ncommiseration, misunderstanding of the nature and purposes of our enemy,\r\nor any or all of these causes combined with others, the dear-bought\r\nadvantages we have won, and disasters untold involve the future of the\r\nland. Terrible beyond description will be, in that event, the condition\r\nof the Union and emancipationist party now incipiently developing itself\r\nat the South;--abandoned and deserted by the withdrawal of the actual\r\npresence and protection of Northern arms. No barbarism on earth, no\r\nsavagism extant, is so barbarous or so savage as the ruthless vengeance\r\nwith which this hybrid civilization of the South is ready at any time to\r\nvisit the crime of abolitionism; and seven times hotter than usual will\r\nthe furnace of their wrath be heated against Southern men who under the\r\nægis of Northern protection shall have exhibited some sympathy with\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nThat a powerful Northern party will immediately arise in behalf of the\r\nsimple readmission of the Southern States, upon precisely the old basis,\r\nwhen the war shall end by the suppression of the rebellion, is certain.\r\nThe existence of such a party will rest, in part, upon a real sympathy\r\nwith the South and the rebellion; partly upon interested political\r\nmotives of a more ordinary and short-sighted character; and, in still\r\ngreater part than either of these, upon the easy credence and\r\ninsufficient information of the great mass of the Northern people;\r\nsomewhat, indeed, upon a magnanimity highly creditable to their\r\ncharacter as men, but unwise and dangerous in the extreme, in any\r\nexercise of it which should surrender a vital advantage.\r\n\r\nIt does not require even that the complete reconquest of the South\r\nshould be awaited in order that the question of the return of subdued\r\nStates into the Union upon the old terms should be sprung upon the\r\nnation, and perhaps decided, by a precedent, before the attention of\r\nthe country can be thoroughly directed to the momentous nature of the\r\nstep proposed. The _New York Herald_ has been hitherto a steady and\r\nconsistent advocate of this policy, and a powerful agitator in its\r\nbehalf. The following extract from its columns indicates the imminence\r\nof the issue, as well as the simple and seemingly reasonable political\r\nmachinery by which the whole thing is to be effected:\r\n\r\n     'It appears from the correspondence to which we have referred that\r\n     certain citizens of New Orleans, some of whose names are given\r\n     elsewhere, have resolved to restore Louisiana to the Union, and\r\n     that they intend to do this in the manner pointed out by Secretary\r\n     Seward in his famous reply to the intervention despatch of M.\r\n     Drouyn de Lhuys. That is to say, they intend to set the State\r\n     Government in motion, elect members of the Legislature, and send\r\n     loyal representatives to Congress. These gentlemen assert--and the\r\n     _Tribune_ does not deny--that Mr. Seward and Mr. Bates indorse this\r\n     idea, and that Mr. Etheridge, as Clerk of the House of\r\n     Representatives, has consented to receive the loyal members from\r\n     Louisiana, upon their own credentials, until the House is\r\n     organized. They also say--and the _Tribune_ does not deny--that Mr.\r\n     Etheridge has a perfect right to do this upon the precedent\r\n     established by the Broad Seal controversy, some twenty years ago.\r\n     Under these circumstances, the Union men propose to hold an\r\n     election for five members of Congress--one from each district and\r\n     one on the general ticket--and also for members of the State Senate\r\n     and Assembly. 'They are anxious,' says the _Tribune_ correspondent,\r\n     'that Louisiana shall take the lead in this matter, and there is no\r\n     doubt but Mississippi and the other States will, in due time,\r\n     follow.' So far, the patriotic reader will search in vain for any\r\n     objection to a plan which promises so much good for the Union, and\r\n     will be at a loss to know upon what grounds the _Tribune_ can\r\n     oppose it with any show of loyalty.'\r\n\r\nIt is no part of the object of this writing to discuss the legality or\r\nthe constitutionality of any course of proceeding in the premises. What\r\ncan be done and what cannot be done under the law, as it stands, is a\r\nquestion for lawyers and judges. How far, if at all, the exigency has\r\nannulled or modified the law; how far the axiom, _inter arma silent\r\nleges_ ('in war the laws are silent'), shall be stretched to cover the\r\ncase, is a question for statesmen and military commanders. The writer of\r\nthese strictures speaks from none of those points of view, but as a\r\nsocial philosopher, viewing the drifts of inevitable consequence from\r\none or the other grand policy in respect to the national\r\ndestiny--irrespective of the minor measures by which it may be executed.\r\nA course utterly suicidal, viewed from this higher platform of\r\nobservation, may proceed with the most unimpeachable subserviency to all\r\nthe forms of the law; or, contrariwise, a policy replete with the\r\nhighest prosperity and happiness of the coming ages, may chance to have\r\nits foundations laid in some startling deviation from all considerations\r\nof precedent and routine.\r\n\r\nIn other words, what can be done or cannot be done under the law, or\r\nwithout violence to the law, is not now the question under\r\nconsideration. What _must_ be done, whether under the law or above the\r\nlaw,[12] to secure certain great ends of human progression, and to avoid\r\npositions of utter disaster to the life of the American people of the\r\nfuture, _is so_.\r\n\r\nWhether the theory of Mr. Sumner, that the revolted States are, by the\r\noperation of the revolt, or should be by the action of the Government,\r\nremanded to the territorial condition, holds good; whether the theory of\r\nMr. Owen, that the machinery of the State Governments at the South\r\nremains unaffected by the insurrection, but that the inhabitants, being\r\ntraitors, are incapable of administering it, until they are purged of\r\ntheir treason by the action of the United States Government, is held to\r\nbe the better opinion; or, whether, in fine, the easy and simple theory\r\nof the _Herald_ is the law of the subject--none of these points is _the_\r\npoint of the present investigation. We seek to fix attention on the\r\nconsequences of the act of an early readmission of the revolted States,\r\nand, what would be the same thing, of the old and governing set of\r\nslaveholding politicians, from those States, into the administration of\r\nour national affairs, no matter what should be the method of its\r\naccomplishment. In that event, the war will not be ended, but smothered\r\nmerely, and left smouldering. It will burst out again, and all that has\r\nbeen done hitherto will have to be done over again, or fail to be\r\naccomplished, and the consequences of failure endured.\r\n\r\nLet no ordinary and superficial method of reasoning obfuscate the public\r\nmind on this subject. It is becoming popular to say and to think that\r\nslavery at the South is already a dead or a dying institution, by the\r\noperation of the war. This opinion has in it, undoubtedly, the value of\r\na prophecy, provided the war be continued to its legitimate termination;\r\nprovided all the measures against slavery hitherto adopted are firmly\r\nmaintained; provided the incipient anti-slavery sentiment now being\r\ndeveloped in the South, be wisely fostered and protected by the strong\r\narm long enough, or until new institutions and new methods of thinking\r\nand acting have time to consolidate. But, whoever supposes that slavery\r\nis as yet even essentially weakened, provided, for any reason, our\r\nforces and the influence of Northern sentiment were suddenly withdrawn\r\nfrom the South, and the ocean waves of the old despotism were for a\r\nmoment even permitted to surge back over those portions of the territory\r\nwhich have been partially redeemed, has no adequate idea of the\r\ntremendous vitality of that institution.\r\n\r\nA mistake on this subject, of the safe early return of the revolted\r\nStates, will be one of those political blunders worse than a crime; and\r\nyet it is precisely this mistake which the American people are at this\r\nhour most likely to commit. A latent love of Southern institutions _per\r\nse_; the hope of personal political advantage, among politicians, by an\r\nalliance with Southern leaders, on the part of others who care nothing\r\nfor the South as such; a lingering tenderness, a forgiving magnanimity\r\nand generosity, among the people at large, which would in this case be\r\nwholly misplaced; and finally an easy faith in the extent and\r\nirrevocable nature of the successes already accomplished--all concur to\r\nlead on to the commission of this error.\r\n\r\nTalk as we will of the purposes of this war, the hand of destiny is upon\r\nus. We must accept the _rôle_ of emancipators and champions of human\r\nfreedom, or the only alternative will happen, the loss of our own\r\nliberties and the forfeiture of our national office as the leader of\r\nProgress combined with Order, on the planet. We have to deal with an\r\nimplacable, a subtle, and a versatile enemy, wholly committed to the\r\nopposite cause; unscrupulous, inappreciative of magnanimity or\r\nconcession of any kind; restrained by no considerations whatsoever short\r\nof the accomplishment of his absolute and tyrannical will. We have this\r\nenemy nearly prostrate under our feet, and we stand hesitating whether\r\nto avail ourselves of our advantage or to stultify ourselves at the\r\ntribunal of the world and of history, by allowing him to rise, to\r\nrepossess himself of his arms, and to recommence the conflict upon terms\r\nof equal advantage.\r\n\r\nA glance at the remaining alternative outcomings of the war must be\r\nreserved for another article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [The article with this title is written by Mr. NICHOLAS\r\n     ROWE, of London. Mr. ROWE is a lineal descendant of\r\n     the celebrated NICHOLAS ROWE, the author of the tragedy of\r\n     _Jane Shore_ and other well-known poems. The author, like his\r\n     famous ancestor, is a man of talents and a friend of freedom. His\r\n     account of the old English Press is one of the most perfect ever\r\n     given. He intends to bring the subject down to the present period,\r\n     and will become a regular contributor to our Magazine.--ED.\r\n     CONTINENTAL.]\r\n\r\n     It is impossible to overestimate the influence of the English\r\n     press. It has raised itself to such a pitch of importance that it\r\n     has been not inaptly termed the fourth estate of the realm. But the\r\n     power which it wields is so enormous and so widespread that it\r\n     would be nearer the truth to concede to it the dignity of the first\r\n     estate. All classes see so clearly their interest in supporting it,\r\n     that the press has become, in effect, a general arbitrator, a court\r\n     of last appeal, to which kings, lords, and commons in turn address\r\n     themselves for support whenever the overwhelming force of public\r\n     opinion is to be conciliated or enlisted. It is in morals what a\r\n     multitude is in physics, and it may, without exaggeration, be said\r\n     that for all purposes of progress and of good the press of England\r\n     has in reality become something more than a single estate of the\r\n     realm, since it combines in itself, and exceeds the authority of\r\n     all. But while raised to this lofty pinnacle of greatness, it does\r\n     not, it dares not, it cannot from its very constitution permanently\r\n     abuse its power; and though isolated attempts have been, from time\r\n     to time, made in this direction, yet they have in the end, as was\r\n     to be expected, reaped nothing but disaster and disgrace. 'Great is\r\n     journalism,' says Carlyle. 'Is not every able editor a ruler of the\r\n     world, being a persuader of it?' Yes, truly a ruler of the world,\r\n     whose supremacy all other rulers must unhesitatingly acknowledge or\r\n     perish miserably and forever. Yes, truly a persuader of the world,\r\n     because he is the mouthpiece of the people, whose earnest, mighty\r\n     voice is making itself heard more and more irresistibly every day,\r\n     to the utter discomfiture and overthrow of the hydra-headed avatars\r\n     of the priestcraft and kingcraft and all the other mouldy and\r\n     rank-smelling relics of the dark ages. The press is the arch\r\n     apostle of civilization, progress, and truth--the Greatheart, whose\r\n     mission it is to combat and destroy the giants Pope and Pagan, Maul\r\n     and Despair, and all other misleaders and oppressors of men.\r\n     Language itself might be exhausted before all that could be said in\r\n     favor of the uses, benefits, and value of the press had found\r\n     fitting expression. The greatest and best of men have expatiated\r\n     upon this noble theme, but probably the truest and most eloquent\r\n     panegyric ever bestowed upon it is that of Sheridan:\r\n\r\n     'Give me but the liberty of the press, and I will give to the\r\n     minister a venal House of Peers--I will give him a corrupt and\r\n     servile House of Commons--I will give him the full sway of the\r\n     patronage of office--I will give him the whole host of ministerial\r\n     influence--I will give him all the power that place can confer upon\r\n     him to purchase up submission and overawe resistance--and yet,\r\n     armed with the liberty of the press, I will go forth to meet him\r\n     undismayed--I will attack the mighty fabric he has reared with that\r\n     mightier engine--I will shake down from its height corruption, and\r\n     bury it amidst the ruins of the abuses it was meant to shelter.'\r\n\r\nHad Sheridan never uttered or written anything besides these burning\r\nwords, he would have merited immortal fame, and unquestionably obtained\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe press is not a thing of yesterday, for it is the slow growth of two\r\ncenturies; neither did it burst upon the world armed at all points, like\r\nthe fabled Athene. Yet in other respects the comparison holds good, for\r\nthe press, like Athene, unites in itself the attributes of power and\r\nwisdom combined; it fosters and protects science, industry, and art; it\r\nis the patron of all useful inventions; it is the preserver of the\r\nstate, and everything that gives strength and prosperity to the state;\r\nit is the champion of law, justice, and order, and extends its\r\nprotecting ægis over the weak, the downtrodden, and the oppressed. It\r\nhas taken two centuries, as we have already said, to make the press what\r\nit is; and a terrible uphill fight has it had to wage. Tyranny,\r\ndogmatism, and intolerance in high places, and ignorance and\r\nsuperstition in low, have ever been its sworn enemies. It has had its\r\nsaints and martyrs, more worthy of canonization in men's hearts than\r\nmany written high in the calendar of Rome. But though persecuted,\r\ncrushed, and at times apparently done to death, its vitality was\r\nindestructible, and after every knock-down blow it rose again from the\r\nearth, like Antæus, with renewed strength. It was always a vigorous\r\nstripling, and even so far back as the days of David Hume its future\r\ngreatness and magnificent destiny was clearly marked out, so that he\r\nwrote: 'Its liberties and the liberties of the people must stand or fall\r\ntogether.' Liberty and the press in England are convertible terms, and\r\nthis is the true reason of the success and power it enjoys. It is also\r\nthe cause of the persecutions it has had to undergo. Tyranny and the\r\npress are as necessarily opposed to each other as are the principles of\r\ngood and evil. The word 'tyranny' is not here intended to refer only to\r\nthe despotic rulers of states and kingdoms, but to include the\r\noppression practiced by the strong upon the weak, the rich upon the\r\npoor, the great upon the small, whether nations or individuals. The\r\npress, moreover, is the guardian of social, political, and religious\r\nmorality. The greatest as well as the most trifling affairs which\r\nconduce to the well-being and comfort of the multitude are eagerly\r\ncanvassed. The faults and vices which disfigure and disgrace even the\r\nmost advanced forms of civilization are unshrinkingly laid bare, and the\r\nproper remedies prescribed. The political conduct of nations and of\r\npublic men is carefully scrutinized, and every false step that they may\r\nmake is immediately noted, commented upon, and held up to public\r\nreprobation. Religious questions, although, ever since the world began,\r\nthey have been approached in a very different spirit to those of any\r\nother description, and have been debated with greater heat and passion\r\nthan the bitterest political disputes, and with a lamentable disregard\r\nof logic and common sense, are now-a-days treated with a candor and\r\nfairness that has never yet characterized them. The press is, in fact,\r\nthe great physician of the mind, whose duty it is to impart a healthy\r\ntone to the inner nature of man, to check the ravages of disease in it,\r\nand, wherever it may imagine any traces of poison to lurk, to administer\r\na prompt and immediate antidote. It may not always and at once prosper\r\nin its endeavors. Wrong-doing may still, in some cases, prove too\r\nstrong, vices may have become inveterate, diseases chronic, and the\r\npoison may have been too completely absorbed. But not, therefore, is the\r\npress discouraged: like Robert Bruce's spider, it returns again and\r\nagain to its task, and--success does and must crown it in the end.\r\n\r\nBut while faithfully performing these lofty duties, in the discharge of\r\nwhich it employs the trained minds and practised pens of the greatest\r\nliterary talent of the time, the press has other functions, which, if\r\nnot of such paramount importance, yet possess no small utility and\r\nvalue. By no means the least of these is that of merely furnishing the\r\nnews of the day; and that this was the primary intention of the\r\nnewspaper its very name proves. Comment, argument, and reasoning were\r\nafter additions. There are thousands of persons at the present day even,\r\nwho patronize a newspaper solely for its news, and who do not trouble\r\ntheir heads about any other portion of its contents. The births,\r\nmarriages, and deaths are eagerly perused by many who expect to meet in\r\nthat domestic chronicle with the names of their friends and\r\nacquaintances. The court news and the movements of royalty and the upper\r\nten thousand have great charms for a large section of the community.\r\nAccidents and offences and sensation headings, such as 'horrible\r\nmurder,' 'melancholy suicide,' 'terrific explosion,' 'fatal shipwreck,'\r\n'awful railway collision,' and the like, have powerful attractions for\r\nthat class which is--alas for human nature!--only too numerous, and\r\nwhich likes to sup full of horrors--in print. In the same category with\r\nthese may be placed police news, and the proceedings in the divorce\r\ncourt, the full reports of which are a blemish from which not even the\r\ngreatest of English journals are free. There have been found able and\r\nhonest men to defend these reports on the ground of the 'interests of\r\nmorality,' than which there is not a more abused phrase in print. But to\r\nthe man of ordinary common sense it would appear that more harm than\r\ngood results from them. Where can the viciously disposed man or the\r\nnovice in crime apply with better prospects of instruction in the\r\npursuit of his evil designs than to the columns of the newspaper? It is\r\nperhaps not too much to say that for every two persons whom these\r\nreports deter from crime, there are three who have been either initiated\r\nor hardened in wickedness and sin by their means. This is a matter which\r\ncalls loudly for reform; and let it, with all sorrow and humility, be\r\nconfessed, one in which the better American journals shine vastly\r\nsuperior to their English brethren. To the general reader for\r\namusement's sake only, those scraps _de omnibus rebus et quibusdam\r\naliis_ with which editors fill up odd corners supply ample\r\ngratification. But those who read for amusement's sake only, or from\r\nmere idle curiosity, are by no means the majority, and a tolerable\r\ninsight may be obtained into a man's character and bias of mind by\r\nobserving what is the part of the paper to which he first turns when he\r\nunfolds it. The man who is absorbed in business pursuits turns to the\r\nprices of stocks and shares, the values of articles of merchandise, and\r\nthe rates of discount and exchange. He will also probably glance at the\r\n'latest intelligence' and the most recent telegrams, but only with the\r\nview of forming an opinion as to how the world of commerce and\r\nspeculation will be affected thereby. The politician finds matter to his\r\ntaste in the leading articles, the Parliamentary debates and the letters\r\nof foreign correspondents, and, perhaps, after a careful perusal of\r\nthem, flatters himself that he has at last mastered the intricacies of\r\nthe Schleswig-Holstein question, or has arrived at an understanding of\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon's policy in Rome. The scientific man and the\r\nliterary man have their attention fixed by the reports of the meetings\r\nof the various learned societies, the accounts of new discoveries and\r\ninventions, and the reviews of new publications. This enumeration might\r\nbe extended almost _ad infinitum_, but to sum up briefly, whatever a\r\nman's taste or predilections may be, he will be able to gratify them to\r\nhis heart's content.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one portion of the newspaper which must not be passed\r\nover without especial notice, and which is so varied in its contents\r\nthat it appeals to all classes. This is the advertisements. The man who\r\nwishes to buy may here ascertain whither he must bend his steps to\r\nobtain the article he desires, and the man who wishes to sell may here\r\nmeet with a purchaser; and it is truly wonderful to observe how the two\r\ngreat requirements of demand and supply, in all their varied\r\nramifications, are satisfied or seem to be satisfied in these columns.\r\nIf one may put faith in them, it is possible to gratify every mortal\r\nwish and every mortal want through their instrumentality, on one\r\ncondition, and that condition is--money. But even this condition may be\r\nsatisfied through the same medium. Are there not untold fortunes\r\ninvested in Government securities and unclaimed for years, only waiting\r\nfor the lawful owners or rightful heirs to come forward and obtain them\r\nthrough the agency of those obliging gentlemen who make it their\r\nbusiness to investigate such matters? Are there not also numbers of\r\nbenevolent philanthropists eagerly longing for opportunities to lend\r\nmoney in large or small amounts, on personal security only, to such\r\npersons even as are not fortunate enough to be rightful owners or lawful\r\nheirs? The curious part of the affair, however, is that there are also\r\nso many people who want to borrow money upon the same terms. Do these\r\ntwo classes, we wonder, ever come together through the intervention of\r\nthe advertisement, and does the result wished for on both sides follow,\r\nor does it not? If it does, why need both sets of advertisements appear\r\nat all? And if it does not, what is the use of repeating either of them\r\nday after day and week after week? The man of imagination must take\r\nespecial delight in the advertising columns. What splendid feasts they\r\nafford him to banquet upon! Some of them, in a few pithy lines, contain\r\nthe plot of a three-volume novel or the materials for a grand sensation\r\nmelodrama. What tragedies and what comedies he may weave out of one or\r\ntwo mysterious and almost unintelligible sentences! What reveries he may\r\nindulge in, what castles in the air--the most harmless and inexpensive\r\nof building operations--he may construct, provided he start with the\r\nhypothesis, 'If I were to buy this,' or 'If I were to invest in that,'\r\nand all the time he has neither the intention nor the ability of\r\npurchasing the one or of investing in the other! How seductive are the\r\nnotifications by auctioneers and land agents of the 'charming and\r\nvaluable territorial estates, with the disposal of which they have had\r\nthe honor of being intrusted'! The dweller in towns, who, chained to the\r\none unceasing, unvarying round of official toil, still sighs for the\r\ncountry, and, like Virgil, envies the 'fortunati agricolæ,' may here\r\ngive the reins to his fancy, and indulge his rural proclivities _ad\r\nlibitum_. When the day's labors are over, and he sits in slippered ease\r\n'by his own fireside,' what greater enjoyment can he have than to\r\nabandon himself in true Barmecidal fashion to the tempting dainties\r\nwhich the last page of the supplement to the _Times_ offers to his keen\r\nappetite! How he revels in the luscious descriptions of 'noble parks,'\r\n'swelling lawns,' 'ancestral woods,' 'silver lakes,' and 'endless\r\npanoramas of scenery unequalled in the world'! How proudly he lingers\r\nover the pictures of 'baronial castles,' and 'time-honored manorial\r\nresidences, indissolubly linked with the proudest names and proudest\r\ndeeds of England's history'! If he be a sportsman--and what Englishman\r\nis not, more or less?--how intoxicating to him is the enumeration of\r\n'game of all sorts, and countless myriads of wild fowl,' only waiting\r\nhis advent to fall victims to his prowess! If he be a philanthropist,\r\nwhat visions of model farms, model cottages and model schools, of a\r\nhappy and contented peasantry, of comely, smiling matrons, and troops of\r\nruddy-cheeked children may he not conjure up! If he be ambitious, what\r\ndreams of greatness crowd upon him--the revered benefactor of the\r\nparish, the respected chairman of the bench of magistrates, nay, even\r\nthe county member returned to Parliament without a dis-sentient voice!\r\nHis fancy runs riot, and there is no limit to the bright future which\r\nthe skilful hand of the cunning knight of the hammer unfolds before his\r\nenraptured gaze.\r\n\r\nTo the energetic, enterprising man, how tempting must be those\r\nprospectuses of schemes for the development of the vast and in many\r\ncases untried natural, industrial, and commercial resources of the\r\ncountry, which, combining in an eminent degree both pleasure and profit,\r\ninvite his coöperation upon the joint-stock principle! How delightful to\r\nhim must be those announcements of wonderful inventions--secured by a\r\npatent--and of old-established business firms, which offer a safe\r\ninvestment for his spare hundreds and thousands by way of partnership,\r\nwith the certainty of immediate and enormous returns! To the invalid and\r\nthe valetudinarian, how cheering must be those modest and disinterested\r\nencomiums upon the virtues of certain nostrums and specifics, which\r\ncannot but carry conviction to his mind that there is a certain cure for\r\n'all the ills that flesh is heir to!' And lastly, not to enlarge the\r\nlist any further, what a glow of heartfelt pleasure and gratitude must\r\nthe really good and benevolent man experience when he peruses the\r\nreports of charitable societies, with their statistics of poverty,\r\nmisery, and privation, which afford him a channel for the dispensation\r\nin works of mercy of the superfluous wealth with which a bountiful\r\nProvidence has blessed him!\r\n\r\nSuch being the manifold uses and advantages of the newspaper, we are\r\ntempted for a moment to pause and reflect upon what would be the\r\ncondition of the world without it. What a dreary waste it would be! Man\r\nis an inquisitive animal, and at the present day is just like the\r\nAthenians of old, going about seeking for some new thing. What would\r\nbecome of him if the provender supplied him by his newspaper were\r\nsuddenly cut off? The consequences to society and to individuals would\r\nbe frightful to contemplate, and the mind especially recoils with horror\r\nfrom the fate which would assuredly overtake those elderly\r\nclub-loungers, whose sole aim and object in life appears to be the daily\r\nperusal of their favorite journal. How disastrous would be the effects\r\nof such a stoppage to those persons who are compelled to pass the\r\ngreater portion of their lives together! They could not possibly\r\ncontrive to get through the day, and before long life itself would\r\nbecome burdensome to them. Vast numbers of people have no ideas of their\r\nown, and are therefore compelled to borrow them elsewhere. How important\r\nis the part which the newspaper plays in that elsewhere! Paterfamilias\r\ncomes down to breakfast--his newspaper fresh, clean, and tidily folded,\r\nlies invitingly on the table--he eagerly seizes it, and is forthwith\r\nfurnished with topics of conversation with his family. When he is\r\nthoroughly posted up in the news of the day, he sallies forth, and is\r\nready to interchange ideas at secondhand with any acquaintance he may\r\nmeet. What would become of Paterfamilias, his family, and his friends,\r\nif they were deprived of this resource? The whole framework of society\r\nwould be unhinged, business and pleasure would alike come to a\r\nstandstill, and the world would again relapse into barbarism and chaos.\r\n\r\nBut let us turn from these fanciful speculations to a sober recital of\r\nfacts in connection with the history of the press.\r\n\r\nThe derivation of the word 'newspaper' has been the subject of much\r\ndispute. Some learned and ingenious writers, disdaining the obvious\r\n'new,' have gone very far afield in their researches. Among other\r\nderivations which have been suggested, is one taken from the four\r\ncardinal points of the compass, N. E. W. S.; because the intelligence\r\nconveyed came from all quarters of the globe. This suggestion is\r\ncontained in an old epigram:\r\n\r\n  'The word explains itself without the Muse,\r\n   And the four letters tell from whence comes News;\r\n   From N. E. W. S. the solution's made,\r\n   Each quarter gives account of war and trade.'\r\n\r\nAnd also, probably in jest, in the 'Wit's Recreations,' published in\r\n1640:\r\n\r\n  'Whence news doth come if any would discusse,\r\n   The letters of the word resolve it thus:\r\n   News is conveyed by letter, word, or mouth,\r\n   And comes to us from North, East, West, and South.'\r\n\r\nFor the first origin of newspapers in Europe we must look to Rome, and\r\nthere can be no reasonable doubt that the earliest germs of news sheets\r\nare to be found among that wonderful people, who have left such enduring\r\nmonuments of themselves wherever they carried their victorious eagles.\r\nThe Roman news sheets were called _Acta Diurna_, and were issued by the\r\nGovernment, and affixed to the walls in the most public places in the\r\ncity. They were also carefully stored in a building set apart for the\r\npurpose, where any person could have access to them, and make copies of\r\nthem for the benefit of their friends in distant parts of the empire. It\r\nis probable also that the Roman historians availed themselves of them in\r\ntheir compilations. They were not only reports of the ordinary\r\noccurrences in the city, but journals of the proceedings in the courts\r\nand town councils as well, and they contain records of trials,\r\nelections, punishments, buildings, deaths, sacrifices, state\r\nceremonials, prodigies, etc., etc. They are alluded to in the\r\ncorrespondence between Cicero and Coelius, when the great orator was\r\ngovernor of Cilicia. Coelius had promised to send him an account of\r\nthe news of Rome, and encloses in his first letter a journal of the\r\nevents which had transpired in the city during his absence. Cicero, in\r\nreply, complains that his friend had misinterpreted his wishes, and says\r\nthat he had not desired him to send an account of the matches of\r\ngladiators, the adjournments of the courts, and occurrences of that\r\nkind, which nobody dared to talk to him about even when he was residing\r\nin Rome: what he wanted was a description of the course of politics and\r\nbut the newspaper of Chrestus. He also refers to these sheets, that is\r\nto say, to accounts of public affairs _in actis_ and _ex actis_, in two\r\nletters to Cassius and one to Brutus, written previously to the\r\ntriumvirate. Suetonius also makes mention of them, and says that Julius\r\nCæsar, in his consulship, ordered the diurnal acts of the senate and the\r\npeople to be published. Tacitus relates a speech of a courtier to Nero\r\nto induce him to execute Thrasea, and among other things he says:\r\n'Diurna populi Romani per provinciam per exercitus accuratius leguntur\r\nut noscatur quid Thrasea non fecerit.' Seneca and the younger Pliny also\r\nallude to them. Dr. Johnson, in the preface to the tenth volume of the\r\n_Gentleman's Magazine_, published in 1740, enters into a disquisition\r\nupon these _acta diurna_, and gives an account of the discovery of some\r\nof them with the date of 585 A. U. C., and adds some specimens\r\nfrom them. He quotes them from the 'Annals of Rome,' by Stephen Pighius,\r\nwho declares that he obtained them from James Susius, by whom they were\r\nfound among the MSS. belonging to Ludovicus Vives. Their authenticity\r\nhas, as might be expected, been hotly disputed by many learned scholars\r\nat various times, but sufficient grounds have not been adduced for their\r\nrejection. The most suspicious circumstance connected with them is their\r\nresemblance, _mutatis mutandis_, to a newspaper of the present day. Thus\r\namong other things we are told that the consul went in grand procession\r\nto sacrifice at the temple of Apollo, just as now a-days we might read\r\nthat Queen Victoria went in state to St. Paul's, or attended divine\r\nservice at the chapel royal, St. James's. Then we are favored with an\r\naccount of the setting forth of Lucius Paulus Æmilius, the consul, for\r\nthe war in Macedonia, and a description of the departure of the embassy\r\nof Popilius Lena, Caius Decimus, and Caius Hostilius to Syria and Egypt,\r\nwith a great attendance of relations and clients, and of their offering\r\nup a sacrifice and libations at the temple of Castor and Pollux before\r\ncommencing their journey. Then we hear how an oak was struck by\r\nlightning on the summit of Mount Palatine, which was called _Summa\r\nVelia_, and have the particulars given us of a fire which took place on\r\nMount Coelius, together with an account of the crucifixion of a\r\ncertain noted pirate. Dramatic intelligence is represented by a\r\ndescription of the plays acted in honor of the goddess Cybele; and under\r\nthe head of 'fashionable intelligence,' the Jenkins of the day\r\nchronicles the funeral of Marcia, a noble Roman matron, and remarks that\r\nthe attendance of images was greater than that of mourners. He also adds\r\nan account of the entertainment given to the people by her sons upon the\r\noccasion. By way of police news, we find a record of a disturbance in a\r\ntavern, in which the tavern keeper was severely wounded; and how\r\nTertinius, the ædile, fined some butchers for selling meat which had not\r\nbeen inspected by the overseers of the market. A counterpart of this\r\ntransaction may be met with every day in the city of London, but the\r\nresult of the affair is much the more satisfactory in Rome, for whereas\r\nwe do not know for certain what becomes of the money obtained from the\r\npenalty in London, we learn that the ædile directed it to be devoted to\r\nthe building of an additional chapel to the temple of the goddess\r\nTellus. Dr. Johnson also quotes a second series of _Acta Diurna_, with\r\nthe date of 691 A. U. C., from the 'Camdenian Lectures' of\r\nDodwell in 1688 to 1691. Dodwell says that he obtained them from his\r\nfriend Hadrian Beoerland, who got them from Isaac Vossius, by whom they\r\nwere copied from certain MSS. in the possession of Petavius. Among other\r\nthings contained in this second set, we find noted certain trials, with\r\nthe number of the votes for and against the defendant, a bargain for the\r\nrepairs of a certain temple, an announcement by one of the prætors that\r\nhe shall intermit his sittings for five days, in consequence of the\r\nmarriage of his daughter, and an account of the pleading of Cicero in\r\nfavor of Cornelius Sulla, and of his gaining his cause by a majority of\r\nfive judges.\r\n\r\nSuch are the earliest traces of newspapers to be found, and long\r\ncenturies elapse before we again catch a glimpse of anything of the\r\nkind. Although it is the great Anglo-Saxon race alone which can boast of\r\nhaving developed the usefulness and liberty of the press to its fullest\r\ncapabilities, both in England and America, yet it is not to us that the\r\ncredit belongs of having been the first to reintroduce newspapers in\r\nEurope. Whether or no the Romans introduced their _Acta Diurna_ into\r\nBritain, and whether or no any imitations of them sprang up then or in\r\nafter times, it is impossible to say. Some writers have asserted that\r\nnews sheets were in circulation in England at all events so early as the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century, but as their assertions rest upon no\r\nvery trustworthy basis, they must be at once thrown aside. It is to\r\nItaly that we must again turn for the reappearance of the newspaper. It\r\nwas in 1536, or thereabouts, that the Venetian magistracy caused\r\naccounts of the progress of the war which they were waging against\r\nSuleiman II, in Dalmatia, to be written and read aloud to the people in\r\ndifferent parts of the city. The news sheet appeared once a month, and\r\nwas called _Gazetta_, deriving its name, probably, from a coin so\r\ncalled, of the value of something less than a cent, either because that\r\nwas the price of the sheet, or the sum paid for reading it, or for\r\nhaving it read. There are thirty volumes of this MS. newspaper preserved\r\nin the Maggliabecchi Library at Florence, and there are also some in the\r\nBritish Museum, the earliest date of which is 1570. Printed news\r\nletters, with date and number, but not so deserving of the title of\r\nnewspaper, began to appear about the same time in Germany. They were\r\ncalled _Relations_, and were published at Augsburg and Vienna in 1524,\r\nat Ratisbon in 1528, Dollingen in 1569, and Nuremberg in 1571. The first\r\nregular German newspaper appeared at Frankfort, and was entitled\r\n_Frankfurter Oberpostamtszeitung_, in 1615. The first French was brought\r\nout by Renaudot, a physician, in 1632. The first Russian paper came out\r\nunder the auspices of Peter the Great, in 1703, and was styled the _St.\r\nPetersburg Gazette_. Spain did not enter the lists until a year later,\r\nand the _Gazeta de Madrid_ was born in 1704. It could not have been\r\nworth much as a newspaper, inasmuch as the defeat off Cape St. Vincent\r\ndid not appear in its columns until four weeks after it had taken place.\r\n\r\nThere must have been some sort of news sheets in existence in England\r\nabout the same time as the Venetian _Gazetta_, for in the thirty-sixth\r\nyear of King Henry VIII, the following proclamation appeared:\r\n\r\n     'The King's most excellent Majestie, understanding that certain\r\n     light persones, not regarding what they reported, wrote, or sett\r\n     forth, had caused to be ymprinted and divulged certaine newes of\r\n     the prosperous successes of the King's Majestie's army in Scotland,\r\n     wherein, although the effect of the victory was indeed true, yet\r\n     the circumstances in divers points were, in some parte\r\n     over-slenderly, in some parte untruly and amisse reported; his\r\n     Highness, therefore, not content to have anie such matters of so\r\n     greate importance sett forthe to the slaunder of his captaines and\r\n     ministers, nor to be otherwise reported than the truthe was,\r\n     straightlie chargeth and commandeth all manner of persones into\r\n     whose hands anie of the said printed bookes should come,\r\n     ymmediately after they should hear of this proclamation, to bring\r\n     the said bookes to the Lord Maior of London, or to the recorder or\r\n     some of the aldermen of the same, to the intent they might suppress\r\n     and burn them, upon pain that every person keeping anie of the said\r\n     bookes twenty-four hours after the making of this proclamation,\r\n     should suffer ymprisonment of his bodye, and be further punished at\r\n     the King's Majestie's will and pleasure.'\r\n\r\nNone of these obnoxious 'printed bookes' have survived to the present\r\ntime, and it has been contended that they were probably nothing more\r\nthan ballads and copies of doggerel verses. But this is an hypercritical\r\nobjection, or rather groundless guess, for it is evident that the\r\nproclamation points at something far more important. We may safely\r\nconclude that they were newspapers, and that journalism had already\r\nattained sufficient dimensions to alarm the powers that were, and draw\r\ndown their hostility. And a few years later, Pope Gregory XIII\r\nfulminated a bull, called _Minantes_, against the news sheets, as\r\nspreading scandal and defamation, etc.\r\n\r\nIt was long fondly believed that the British Museum counted among its\r\ntreasures a full-blown printed English newspaper, dating so far back as\r\n1588. It was entitled the _English Mercurie_, and purported to be\r\n'published by authoritie for the suppression of false reports, ymprinted\r\nat London by Christopher Barker, her Highness's Printer.' Writer after\r\nwriter exulted in the fact, and was loud in the praises of the sagacity\r\nand wisdom of Burleigh, under whose direction it was supposed to have\r\nbeen issued. But unfortunately for antiquaries and literati, the matter\r\nwas carefully investigated by Mr. Watts, of the British Museum, and he\r\npronounced on unquestionable evidence the copies of the _English\r\nMercurie_ to be nothing but a barefaced forgery, of which he went even\r\nso far as to accuse, on good grounds, the second Lord Hardwicke of being\r\nthe perpetrator. But though we must discard this fictitious account of\r\nthe Spanish armada, etc., other news sheets did actually exist in the\r\nreign of Queen Elizabeth, a list of which has been compiled by Dr.\r\nRimbault. The titles of some of them are: _New Newes, containing a short\r\nrehearsal of Stukely and Morice's Rebellion_, 1579; _Newes from\r\nScotland, declaring the damnable Life of Doctor Fian, a notable\r\nSorcerer, who was burned in Edenborough in January last_, 1591; _Newes\r\nfrom Spain and Holland_, 1593; _Newes from Flanders_, 1599; _Newes out\r\nof Cheshire of the new-found Well_, 1600; _Newes from Gravesend_, 1604.\r\nAs time went on, these 'pamphlets of newes' increased in number. They\r\ntreated of all kinds of intelligence; some derived their materials from\r\nforeign countries, and some from different parts of the kingdom at home;\r\nsome were true, and some were false. Thus we find, among others,\r\n_Lamentable Newes out of Monmouthshire, in Wales, containinge the\r\nwonderfull and fearfull Accounts of the great overflowing of the Waters\r\nin the said Countye_, 1607; _Newes from Spain_, 1611; _Newes out of\r\nGermanie_, 1612; _Wofull Newes from the west partes of England, of the\r\nburning of Tiverton_, 1612; _Good Newes from Florence_, 1614; _Strange\r\nNewes from Lancaster, containinge an Account of a prodigious Monster,\r\nborn in the Township of Addlington, in Lancashire, with two bodyes\r\njoined to one back_, 1613; _Newes from Italy_, 1618; _Newes out of\r\nHolland_, 1619; _Vox Populi, or Newes from Spain_, 1620. About this time\r\nthe news sheets began to assume particular and distinctive titles, under\r\nwhich they appeared at uncertain intervals. We meet with _The Courant,\r\nor Weekly Newes from Foreign Parts_, 1621; _The certain Newes of this\r\npresent Week_, 1622; _The Weekly Newes from Italy, Germany, etc._, 1622,\r\na title which was shortly after exchanged for that of _Newes from most\r\nParts of Christendom, London, printed for Nathaniel Butler and William\r\nSheppard_. These names ought to be preserved, as being those of the\r\ngreat pioneers of regular journalism. It appears, however, that they did\r\nnot always keep the same title for their newspaper, for sometimes it was\r\ncalled _The Last Newes_; at others, _The Weekly Newes continued_; _More\r\nNewes_; _Our Last Newes_, and other various renderings of the same\r\ntheme. This great progenitor of a mighty race also adopted a system of\r\nnumbering, and, though exposed to many dangers and vicissitudes, did not\r\nfinally disappear until 1640. Butler and his contemporaries had to\r\nstruggle with many obstacles, and to contend against many and powerful\r\nfoes. In 1637, Archbishop Laud procured the passing of an ordinance\r\nlimiting the number of master printers to twenty, and punishing with\r\nwhipping and the pillory all such as should print without a license.\r\nButler's name does not occur in this list; so we may conclude that he\r\nwas particularly obnoxious to the haughty prelate and his party. But\r\nthis persevering journalist, whose name had for a long time appeared\r\nalone as the printer of his newspaper, contrived to surmount this\r\ndifficulty, for in a manifesto, dated January 11th, 1640, he says:\r\n\r\n     'Courteous reader! we had thought to have given over printing our\r\n     foreign avisoes, for that the licenser (out of a partial affection)\r\n     would not oftentimes let pass apparent truth, and in other things\r\n     (oftentimes) so crosse and alter, which made us weary of printing;\r\n     but he being vanished (and that office fallen upon another more\r\n     understanding in these forraine affaires, and as you will find more\r\n     candid) we are againe (by the favour of his Majestie and the state)\r\n     resolved to go on printing, if we shall find the world to give a\r\n     better acceptation of them (than of late) by their weekly buying of\r\n     them. It is well known these novels are well esteemed in all parts\r\n     of the world (but heere) by the more judicious, which we can impute\r\n     to no other but the discontinuance of them, and the uncertaine\r\n     daies of publishing them, which, if the post fail us not, we shall\r\n     keep a constant day everie weeke therein, whereby everie man may\r\n     constantly expect them, and so we take leave.'\r\n\r\nThis number of his journal is entitled _The continuation of the Forraine\r\nOccurrents, for five Weeks past, containinge many remarkable Passages of\r\nGermanie, etc.; examined and licensed by a better and more impartiall\r\nhand than heretofore_. Another noticeable thing in this manifesto is the\r\nfirst occurrence of the autocratic editorial 'we.'\r\n\r\nButler had also to contend with the opposition of the news writers or\r\nnews correspondents, who doubtless found his undertaking interfere with\r\ntheir trade. These gentry covenanted for the sum of £3 or £4 a year to\r\nwrite a news letter every post day to their subscribers in the country.\r\nThat this curious trade was thoroughly systematized is evident from the\r\nfollowing passage in Ben Jonson's 'Staple of News,' published in 1635:\r\n\r\n  'This is the outer room where my clerks sit\r\n   And keep their sides, the register i' the midst;\r\n   The examiner he sits private there within--\r\n   And here I have my several rolls and files\r\n   Of news by the alphabet, and all put up\r\n   Under their heads.'\r\n\r\nThe news writers flourished greatly at this period, but as newspapers\r\nbegan to get a footing, their credit gradually declined--and with\r\nreason, if we may put confidence in the following extract from the\r\n_Evening Post_, of September 6th, 1709:\r\n\r\n     'There must be £3 or £4 paid per annum by those gentlemen who are\r\n     out of town for written news, which is so far generally from having\r\n     any probability of matter of fact, that it is frequently stuffed up\r\n     with a 'we hear,' or 'an eminent Jew merchant has received a\r\n     letter,' being nothing more than downright fiction.'\r\n\r\nTo Butler belongs the credit of having been the first to introduce\r\nstreet newsboys, with this difference, that his employés were of the\r\nother sex, and were styled 'Mercurie women.'\r\n\r\nButler was a stanch royalist, and consequently suffered the vengeance of\r\nthe Parliamentary party. He fell into great poverty, and, according to\r\nAnthony à Wood, died on board Prince Rupert's fleet in Kinsale harbor,\r\nin 1649, just as a brighter day was beginning to dawn upon journalism.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between the Parliament and the king set the press free from\r\nthe multiplied restrictions by which it had been 'cabined, cribbed,\r\nconfined' and almost stifled in its cradle. The country became flooded\r\nwith publications of all kinds, of which, while many were trashy,\r\nridiculous, and extravagant, there still remained a considerable portion\r\nwhich materially helped forward that mighty uprising of the people to\r\nwhich England owes her freedom, her glory, and her might.\r\n\r\nAnd here, having introduced to the reader the first real newspaper, and\r\nthe great ancestor of all after editors, and having attended the press\r\nthrough its obscure infancy and perilous childhood, we must pause,\r\nreserving for consideration in a future article the fair promise of its\r\nyouth and the development of its still more glorious manhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSCRIPTION ACT OF MARCH 3D.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew subjects are more difficult of legislation than that of the military\r\nservice of a nation. The most profound wisdom, the most enlightened\r\nstatesmanship, the most intimate knowledge of society, are requisite in\r\nthe legislator. It is easy, indeed, to regulate the military service in\r\ntimes of peace, when the army is small and volunteers are abundant. But\r\nwhen the ordinary methods fail to fill up the ranks, decimated by actual\r\nwar, when the honor and perpetuity of a nation depend upon a\r\nconscription of its citizens, then comes the tug of war, and many\r\nlegislatures have failed in their deliberations on this subject. In the\r\nfirst place, a Conscription Act is opposed to popular prejudice.\r\nCompulsory service of any kind, except for punishment, is contrary to\r\nour ideas of personal freedom. We believe in the sovereign privilege of\r\ndoing what we please, and declining to do what we do not please, to its\r\nfullest possible extent. We love to tell our neighbors that we have no\r\nstanding army to defend our national honor, but that it reposes safely\r\non the _voluntary_ patriotism of the people. We may admit the\r\n_necessity_ for a Conscription Act--may confess its justice and\r\nimpartiality; but few men who are liable to fall into its pitiless\r\nclutches, can speak of such an act without a shrug of uneasiness or a\r\nwicked expression of anger. Again, it must be universal in its\r\napplication. It must meet all classes and conditions of society; must be\r\nadapted to all shades of religious and political belief; must be\r\ninflexible as Justice on his throne, yet tender and sympathetic as a\r\nmother to her child. It must take into consideration different branches\r\nof industry, and the fields of one section must not be depleted of\r\nhusbandmen that those of another may be filled with warriors.\r\n\r\nThe act of March 3d meets these difficulties more successfully, perhaps,\r\nthan any previous act, whether of a State or National Legislature. It is\r\nbased upon the broad and well-admitted maxim, that every citizen owes\r\nhis personal service to the Government which protects him. But while the\r\nGovernment impartially demands this service, the law provides for the\r\nexemption of those who would suffer by the unqualified enforcement of\r\nthis demand.\r\n\r\nMany persons outside of the specified limits of age, are physically able\r\nto do military service. But, _as a class_, it would have been cruel and\r\nimpolitic to have forced men into a service which would have wrecked\r\nhealth and happiness for life, or, by a short and swift passage through\r\nthe military hospitals, have shuffled them into premature graves. Few\r\nmen under twenty-five have the power of endurance necessary for a long\r\nand wearisome campaign. The muscles are not sufficiently knit and\r\nhardened for the service, nor the constitution sufficiently fortified to\r\nwithstand the exposure. Men over forty-five have lost the vigor and\r\nelasticity necessary to long and arduous exertion, and are constantly\r\nliable to become a burden instead of a benefit to the service.\r\n\r\nNo previous act has so equally disposed the military duty among the\r\nvarious classes affected by it. It is a well-known fact that the burdens\r\nof military service are wont to bear most heavily on the _laboring_\r\nclasses. Probably no legislation can entirely remove this inequality.\r\nBut the act of March 3d makes special provision for the indigent and\r\nhelpless, and to a great extent relieves the suffering and inconvenience\r\ndependent on an enforced military conscription. Poverty is not left\r\nwithout relief, infancy without protection, old age without comfort. The\r\ndependent widow, the infirm parent, the homeless orphan, are adopted by\r\nthe Government, and their support and protection provided for. And in\r\norder that the character and dignity of the army may comport with the\r\ngreatness and purity of the cause for which it is fighting--that it may\r\nbe both the power and the pride of the nation, it is expressly provided,\r\nthat 'no person who has been guilty of any felony shall be enrolled or\r\npermitted to serve in said forces.' For the benefit of those whose\r\npeculiar business or family relations require their services at home,\r\nCongress wisely inserted 'the $300 clause.' In this they but followed\r\nthe established custom in most nations since the days of feudalism. No\r\npart of the act has been more violently assailed than this, none more\r\nunjustly. It is asserted that this clause discriminates against the\r\npoor, in favor of the rich; that it recognizes unjust distinctions\r\nbetween the classes of society, and assigns military duty unequally\r\namong the citizens. No assertion could more glaringly display the\r\nauthor's ignorance and lack of judgment.\r\n\r\nThe law, as originally drawn, required the service of the man drafted or\r\nan acceptable substitute within ten days. Had 'the $300 clause' not been\r\ninserted, the competition for substitutes would have been so great that\r\ntheir price would have risen far beyond the ability of men in moderate\r\ncircumstances to pay, and many would have been forced into service who\r\nthus have an opportunity for exempting themselves. It has kept the price\r\nof substitutes at a low figure, and thus has proven itself emphatically\r\nthe poor man's provision.\r\n\r\nNor is the law harsh toward those who may be drafted. Abundant time is\r\ngiven for the settlement of any pressing business, the proper\r\ndisposition of family affairs, or the procuring of a substitute. It is\r\nmild toward the infirm and afflicted, making ample provision for the\r\nexemption of those who, from any cause, are unfit for service.\r\n\r\nIt assures to drafted men the same pay, bounty, clothing, and equipments\r\nas volunteers receive, and in all respects puts them on the same\r\nfooting. It thus removes the unjust distinction wont to be made between\r\nthe drafted man and volunteer, looking upon each as a true soldier of\r\nhis country, equally interested in its honor and perpetuity. And in\r\norder that justice may be secured to the citizen as well as to the\r\nGovernment, the entire business of the enrolment and draft is under the\r\nsupervision of a board of three men, generally residents of the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing spirit of the act, cropping out in almost every section,\r\nis the tenderness with which it handles the subject. It scrupulously\r\nseeks to avoid all violence, injustice, and suffering, and while it\r\nfirmly asks the service of the people, distributes that service equally\r\namong all. And herein is its superiority over all previous militia acts.\r\nState and national officers, members of Congress, custom-house\r\nofficials, postmasters, clerks, and the favored and fortunate generally,\r\nwere heretofore exempt, instead of those who, by misfortune or\r\notherwise, were in circumstances of dependence and want.\r\n\r\nBut the act of March 3d, thus general in its application, thus humane in\r\nits provisions, is not without omissions and imperfections. But these\r\narise rather from the language of its provisions, than from its general\r\ndesign. Let us briefly examine these provisions as they are given in the\r\nsecond section of the act.\r\n\r\nClause second exempts 'the only son liable to military duty of a widow\r\ndependent upon his labor for support.'\r\n\r\nThe Judge Advocate General has decided, that 'a woman divorced from her\r\nhusband who is still living, is not in the sense of the law a widow--a\r\nwidow being defined to be a woman who has lost her husband by death.'\r\nHer only son, therefore, upon whom she may be dependent for her support,\r\ncannot be exempted. A divorced woman, whose husband is still living, may\r\nthus be left entirely without support, unless she have several sons\r\n'liable to draft,' in which case, she may elect one for exemption.\r\n\r\nClause third exempts 'the only son of aged or infirm parent or parents\r\ndependent upon his labor for support.'\r\n\r\nIt has been decided that a son cannot be exempted under this clause\r\nunless _both_ the parents are 'aged or infirm.' Thus it may happen that,\r\nby reason of bodily or mental infirmity, a father, with a family of\r\nhelpless children, may be totally dependent upon the exertions of the\r\nmother and a draftable son. But the law pitilessly takes the son without\r\npossibility of exemption, throwing the entire burden of support upon the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nBut no clause of this section is more liable to objection than the\r\n_fourth_, which reads as follows: 'Where there are two or more sons of\r\naged or infirm parents subject to draft, the father, or if he be dead,\r\nthe mother, may elect which son shall be exempt.' It will be observed\r\nthat the provision--'dependent upon his labor for support'--is omitted\r\nin this clause. Now, to interpret its language by the legal method of\r\nconstruction, by the context, it would seem that such dependence were\r\nnecessary in order to secure the exemption. For the two clauses\r\nimmediately preceding exempt 'the only son of a widow or of aged or\r\ninfirm parent or parents _dependent upon his labor for support_. The two\r\nimmediately following, exempt 'the brother or father of orphan children\r\nunder twelve years of age _dependent upon his labor for support_.' That\r\nis, _four_ of the five clauses referring strictly to this subject, grant\r\nexemption to the applicant only when some one depends upon him for\r\nsupport. Hence it may be presumed, according to an admitted custom of\r\nlegal interpretation, that in the remaining clause, standing between the\r\nother four, the question of dependence, though not expressly _stated_,\r\nis clearly _implied_.\r\n\r\nBut an 'opinion,' published by the Provost-Marshal General's Bureau for\r\nthe guidance of the boards of enrolment, declares that 'the right to\r\nthis exemption does not rest upon the parents' dependence on the labor\r\nof their sons for their support. The law does not contemplate any such\r\ndependence.'\r\n\r\nWhat is the result of this decision?\r\n\r\nFirst, it places the wealthy and independent on the same footing with\r\nthe indigent and needy, exacting from the one no more service than from\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is more lenient toward the wealthy citizen who has several\r\nsons liable to draft, than toward the helpless widow who may have but\r\none.\r\n\r\nThird, it makes a distinction against that family which may have\r\ncontributed most to the military service.\r\n\r\nBy the 'opinion' just quoted, the only fact to be established by parents\r\nelecting one of several sons 'subject to draft,' is that they are 'aged\r\nor infirm'. When this is done, boards of enrolment must grant the\r\nexemption. The parents may live in affluence independent of their\r\nchildren; the sons may all be in the second class except the one\r\nelected; they may reside in different districts or States; they may\r\nbelong to different households: yet, if the same parents, or some\r\nindigent widow adjoining them, had but _one_ son 'liable to military\r\nduty,' or, having _several_, had sent them all into the army save _one_,\r\nthat one remaining could not be exempt unless it were proven that they\r\nactually depended on him for their support. Why should a helpless widow,\r\nhaving but _one_ son, be required to prove her dependence on him for\r\nsupport in order to have him exempted, when her wealthy neighbor, who\r\nhas _two_ sons, can have one of them exempted without this dependence?\r\n\r\nAnother published 'opinion' says: 'Election of the son to be exempted\r\nmust be made _before_ the draft.' Now amid the chances of a draft it may\r\nhappen that the brother or brothers of the elected son may not be drawn.\r\nThus the Government loses the services of the entire family. In many\r\ncases no election would be necessary unless _all_ the sons were drafted,\r\nin which case it could be made as well _after_ as _before_ the draft.\r\nBesides, if there be a considerable interval between the time of\r\nelection and the time of draft, the ground of exemption may no longer\r\nexist when the Government calls for the service of the man.\r\n\r\nOn clause sixth an 'opinion' has been issued, stating that 'the father\r\nof motherless children under twelve years of age, dependent upon his\r\nlabor for their support, is exempt, notwithstanding he may have married\r\na second time and his wife be living.'\r\n\r\nA stepmother is not believed to be a 'mother' in the sense of the act.\r\nAnother 'opinion' declares that the father of children of an insane\r\nmother under twelve years of age dependent on his labor for support, is\r\n_not_ exempt.\r\n\r\nA moment's reflection on these two 'opinions' is sufficient to establish\r\ntheir injustice. A stepmother may and should, in all important respects,\r\ntake the place of the actual mother. Yet the father is exempt. Children\r\nof an insane mother, however, may be left entirely without maternal care\r\nand protection, and the father, upon whom may rest the burden of\r\nchildren and wife, is _not_ exempt.\r\n\r\nClause seventh reads as follows: 'Where there are a father and sons in\r\nthe same family and household, and two of them are in the military\r\nservice of the United States, as non-commissioned officers, musicians,\r\nor privates, the residue of such family or household, not exceeding two,\r\nshall be exempt.'\r\n\r\nIn reading this clause, the question naturally arises: Why is this\r\nprovision made applicable only to families in which the father is still\r\nliving? Why should not a widow, having two uncommissioned sons in the\r\narmy, have her remaining son exempt, as well as if her husband were\r\nstill living? Judge Holt has decided that 'a widow having four sons,\r\nthree of whom are already in the military service, the fourth is exempt,\r\n_provided_ she is dependent on his labor for support.' If the father\r\nwere living, the remaining son would be absolutely exempt.\r\n\r\nThe evident design of this clause is to take into consideration the\r\namount which each family may have contributed to the service. But this\r\ngenerous intention is practically ignored by another 'opinion,' which\r\nmakes it necessary that two members of the same family must be _now_ in\r\nservice, in order that the exempting clause may apply. Thus, by the\r\ncalamities of war, a father and several sons may have been killed or\r\nrendered helpless for life, yet if there remains a son liable to draft\r\nin the same family, he cannot be exempted unless his mother depends on\r\nhim for her support. It must be admitted that the parent or parents who\r\nhave had two sons _killed_ in their country's service, have made quite\r\nas great a sacrifice as those who have two sons still engaged in that\r\nservice. And if the question of support is involved, it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that two sons in the army would do quite as much for needy\r\nparents as two sons in the grave.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the inconsistencies of the law, as it has been\r\ninterpreted by authority. Other cases also may arise that seem to demand\r\nan exempting clause equally with those in the act. Of such are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nFirst, the husband and father of a family depending upon his labor for\r\ntheir support.\r\n\r\nSecond, the only support of an aged or infirm spinster or bachelor.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual for persons of this class to adopt the son of a\r\nrelative or stranger. And when the infirmities of age render such\r\npersons unfit for toil, the youth whom they brought up, and who is now\r\nby his labor repaying their early attentions to him, should, not be\r\ntaken away.\r\n\r\nThird, the only support of helpless children, having neither parents nor\r\ngrown brothers.\r\n\r\nOrphans are often thrown upon the charity of a relative, and it seems\r\nright that their support should not be taken from them. In view of the\r\nmany difficulties presented by the subject of exemptions, the many\r\ndiverse claims that arise, and the impossibility of making a special\r\nprovision for each, would it not be better to adopt a few general\r\nprinciples on the subject, and submit all claims to the judgment of the\r\nboards of enrolment? Thus, instead of clauses second to sixth, inclusive\r\nof the second section, there might be a single proviso that--No person\r\nwho is dependent by reason of age, bodily, or mental infirmity, shall,\r\nby the operations of this act, be deprived of his or her necessary and\r\naccustomed support. This would include all possible cases, and would\r\nsecure to each the necessary maintenance, as designed by the law. It\r\nwould do away with the necessity of an unlimited issue of circulars of\r\nexplanation from the Department at Washington, throwing each case upon\r\nthe judgment of the board, who are to be presumed able to decide\r\nintelligently on proper evidence being given before them. It would avoid\r\nthe unjust and injurious distinctions noticed under clause fourth, and\r\nin the end would secure more men to the Government with less liability\r\nof wrong to the citizen. Clause seventh also could easily be so modified\r\nas to avoid the objections noticed above.\r\n\r\nAnother evident objection to the act of March 3d, is the limited power\r\ngiven to boards of enrolment as such. All clerks, deputy marshals, and\r\nspecial officers, are appointed by the Provost-Marshal alone. Yet a\r\nlarge--perhaps the _chief_ part of their duty is directly connected with\r\nthe enrolment and draft. The judgment of the remaining members of the\r\nboard would certainly be of some value in making these appointments, as\r\nthey are always residents of the district, and hence acquainted with the\r\npeculiar wants of the service and the character of the applicants. The\r\nduties of the commissioner should also be more definitely stated.\r\nSpecial duties are assigned to the marshal and surgeon, but no further\r\ndefinition of the commissioner's labor is given than that he is a member\r\nof the board. Thus there is liability to a conflict of authority and a\r\nshirking of responsibility, which could easily be avoided by more\r\nexplicit divisions of duty. The board system is undoubtedly a good one.\r\nIt gives _the people_ a larger representation in the business of\r\nconducting a draft, tends to secure justice to all, and thus relieves\r\nthe popular prejudice and feeling of opposition to the law itself.\r\n\r\nBut why should not every board of enrolment throughout the country also\r\nbe a board of enlistment? The time is fast approaching when the bulk of\r\nour present army will return home. It is important that as many of these\r\nmen be reënlisted as can be, with any new troops that may offer\r\nthemselves. The Government should avail itself of every opportunity for\r\nmaking voluntary enlistments. And by having a recruiting office within\r\nevery district, convenient to every man's residence, a surgeon always at\r\nhand to examine applicants, offering the authorized Government bounties,\r\nmuch could still be done in this way toward keeping an army in the\r\nfield, without any additional expense or without in the least\r\ninterfering with the draft.\r\n\r\nThe act of March 3d is a law for the present, not for the future. It is\r\nan act for the emergency, not for coming time.\r\n\r\nDuring the long years of peace and prosperity that we have enjoyed, the\r\ngreat truth that every able-bodied man owes military service to his\r\ncountry as sacredly as he owes protection to his family, has slumbered\r\nin the minds of the people. For half a century there was scarcely\r\nanything to remind us of it, and we were fast verging into that hopeless\r\nnational condition, when\r\n\r\n  'Wealth accumulates and men decay.'\r\n\r\nThis act brings duty home to the conscience of the nation. It is an\r\nimpressive enforcement of a great political principle. But if our\r\nquickened sense of obligation fail to make us _act_, if we refuse to\r\nreceive the lessons of wisdom which the developments of the hour force\r\nupon us, if we fail to improve our military organization and\r\ninstruction, and render our able-bodied men effective for military\r\nservice at a moment's call--then this act will have done us little\r\npermanent good. Our men of education and high social position, instead\r\nof aiding to make the militia system respectable by the personal\r\nperformance of military duty and by using their influence to give tone\r\nand character to the service, have evaded its requirements on\r\nthemselves, and have aided in sinking it into disrepute and contempt.\r\nAnd here is where our militia laws are imperfect. They have done but\r\nlittle toward cherishing the military spirit, developing the military\r\nvirtues, or securing an effective military force ready at any time to\r\ntake the field.\r\n\r\nIn the future of our country we want no large standing army. It is\r\ncontrary to the genius of our institutions and to national precedent. We\r\nmust throw the duty of national support and defence directly on the\r\npeople--to them commit our country's honor. The Swiss motto--'No regular\r\narmy, but every citizen a soldier'--must be the foundation of our\r\nmilitary system. The course of the present war has fully demonstrated\r\nthe patriotism and loyalty of the people. The Government can rely upon\r\nits citizens in any emergency. What we want is discipline,\r\norganization, instruction. The act of March 3d does not secure these\r\nessential requisites. It has enrolled the people, but has not made them\r\nsoldiers. We will not here attempt to describe how this can be secured.\r\nBut we may take it for granted that there must be greater facilities for\r\nthe military education of the young and the training of officers, a\r\nproper division of the country into military districts, and stated times\r\nfor the drill and review of the citizen soldiery. Thus we shall be able\r\nto maintain our national existence against invasion from without and\r\nrebellion from within, and, being prepared for war, will be so much the\r\nmore likely to live in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the present number, THE CONTINENTAL enters upon a new\r\nvolume. No efforts will be spared by its editors to increase its value\r\nto its many patrons. The high character of its political articles,\r\nalways emanating from distinguished men and from reliable sources; its\r\nloyal tone and catholic spirit; the great ability with which the\r\nsubjects of the deepest interest to the Government and community are\r\ndiscussed in its pages--entitle it to a high, if not the highest place\r\namong the journals of the country.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to give utterance to the wants, wishes, tastes, views,\r\nhopes, culture of every part of our Union. Having no band of sectional\r\ncollaborators, with local views and prejudices, narrowed horizons and\r\nsimilar cultivation, it is confined to no clique of thinkers however\r\nvigorous, no set of men however cultured, but receives thought and light\r\nfrom every part of our vast country, without favor or prejudice. It is\r\nthe _Continental_, and thus represents and addresses itself to the mind\r\nof the continent.\r\n\r\nThe contributions flowing in, in a continuous stream from every quarter,\r\nare subjected to but one great test--the test of real and substantial\r\nmerit. Thoroughly Christian in the noblest sense of that noble word, it\r\nis never sectarian. Accepting Christianity as a _certain_ fact, it\r\nrejects no scientific inquiry into its bases, convinced that all true\r\nand thorough investigation will but lead men back to faith in a divine\r\nRedeemer. Shallow thought and nascent inquiry may be sceptical, but the\r\ndeep mind is reverential and faithful. The problems of doubt torture the\r\nsoul, and call for solution. Infinite and finite stand in strange\r\nrelations in the mind of man; with his finite powers he would grasp the\r\ninfinite of God. He fails to find the equation of his terms, and,\r\nbaffled in his search, in the insanity of intellectual pride, denies his\r\nMaker. He puts the infinite mysteries of revelation into the narrow\r\ncrucible of the finite, the residuum is--nothing; he calls it immutable\r\nlaws, as if laws could exist without a lawgiver, and bows before a\r\npitiless phantom, where he should love and worship the great I AM!\r\n\r\nExamine fearlessly into nature, O earnest thinker, for the created is\r\nbut the veil of the Creator. Revelation and nature are from the same\r\nGod, and both demand our serious attention. Revelation is indeed the\r\nWord of Nature; the sole key to its many wards of mystery. Truth never\r\ncontradicts itself. Let the savant, whether in material nature or\r\nmetaphysical realms, examine, classify, and arrange his facts--they,\r\nwhen fairly computed, thoroughly investigated, can lead but to one\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nNor will the literary department of this magazine be permitted to\r\nlanguish. Tales, poems, and articles on art and artists, are solicited\r\nfrom all who feel they have something to say, to which the human heart\r\nwill gladly listen. The talent of the East, West, North, and South shall\r\nflow through our pages. Genius shall be welcomed and acknowledged,\r\nthough it may not as yet have registered its name on the radiant walls\r\nof the Temple of Fame. It is the design of THE CONTINENTAL to\r\nrepresent humanity in its different phases; to manifest to its readers\r\nthe thoughts of their fellow beings; to hold up the mirror of our mental\r\nbeing to the complex human soul. Varied modes of thought and views of\r\nlife will be represented in our pages, for as men, nothing that concerns\r\nhumanity can be alien to us. We thus hope to be enabled to offer our\r\nreaders a wide range of subjects, treated from varied standpoints,\r\nhandled by writers widely scattered in space and severed in social\r\nposition. May the divergent rays be blended in a bow of beauty, of peace\r\nand promise to the ark of truth! No personal bitterness shall find place\r\namong us, no immoral lessons sully our record. There may be often want\r\nof pruning, but even the undue luxuriance shall tell of the rich soil\r\nof genius, ever germing and budding into prolific growth.\r\n\r\nMeantime let our patrons continue to trust us, and have patience with\r\nour shortcomings. All that is human is liable to error, and the very\r\nwidth and breadth of our base increases the difficulty of the temple we\r\nwould rear.\r\n\r\nLend us your sympathies and moral aid, courteous reader, for many and\r\ncomplicated are the difficulties with which an editor has to contend.\r\nFor example: 'Your review is quite too serious for success,' says the\r\nfirst; 'its subjects are too heavy and grave; our people read for\r\namusement; you should give us more stories and light reading.'\r\n\r\n'Your review is too light,' says the second; 'the times are pregnant\r\nwith great events, humanity is on its onward march, and a magazine such\r\nas yours ought to be, should have no space to throw away upon\r\nsentimental tales and modern poetry. Your articles should lead our\r\nstatesmen on to the deeper appreciation of political truths, expose\r\nvital fallacies, and not strive to amuse silly women and effeminate\r\nmen.'\r\n\r\n'You do not deal sufficiently with metaphysics,' says a third; 'you\r\nshould reproduce in popular and intelligible form the vast thoughts of\r\nKant, Fichte, Hegel, Schelling, Oken, Ronski, and Trentowski.'\r\n\r\n'Why do you give us so much metaphysics?' cries the fourth; 'modern\r\nphilosophy is essentially infidel; you should not introduce its\r\npoisonous elements among our people.'\r\n\r\n'Such a review as you conduct,' remarks a fifth, 'should be the vehicle\r\nof the thinkers and progressives; they alone are the men to benefit and\r\nattract the attention of the community.'\r\n\r\n'Take great care to have nothing to do with the men calling themselves\r\nprogressive thinkers,' remarks a sixth; 'they are full of vital errors,\r\nspiritualists, socialists, disorganizers. They have in reality nothing\r\nnew to offer; they are the old-clothes men of thought, harlequins\r\njuggling in old Hindoo raiment, striding along in old German May-fair\r\nrags, long since discarded--motley's their only wear--stalking\r\nCagliostros and Kings of Humbug.'\r\n\r\n'You are growing old fogy in your views,' says the seventh; 'we can bear\r\nsermons enough in church of Sundays; we do not buy magazines to read\r\nthem there.'\r\n\r\n'Your journal is fast becoming an Abolition organ,' says the eighth.\r\n\r\n'Do you mean to oppose the Administration and distress the Government?'\r\nsays the ninth.\r\n\r\n'You give us no history,' sighs the tenth.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean by your long historical disquisitions?' vociferates\r\nthe eleventh. 'Nobody cares for the past now. Our hands are full of the\r\npresent. We are ourselves living the most important history which this\r\nglobe has yet seen.'\r\n\r\nCourteous reader, so it goes on forever, through all the unceasing\r\nchanges of thought, heart, mind, soul, taste, which characterize the\r\ngreat, acting, struggling, thinking, conservative, progressive,\r\nbelieving, doubting, Young American people.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we will earnestly strive to hold up the glass of the\r\nconstantly shifting times before you, that you may be enabled to see the\r\nflitting shadows of the hour as they pass across it, grave or gay,\r\nportentous or hopeful, draped in solid political vesture, the toga of\r\nthe statesman, or robed in the blue gossamer of metaphysics, in the\r\ndrapery of sorrow or light hues of joy, in the tried armor of the\r\nDivine, or the dubious motley of the progressive, in the soft, floating,\r\nlustrous, aërial texture of the woman, or the monotonous Shanghai of the\r\nman--while we will forever strive to point you to the Cross of Peace,\r\nthe Heavenly City, and the starry diadem of Eternal Truth. You may read\r\nin our pages of 'immutable laws,' for such is the term now in vogue, but\r\nyou will remember that these words are but a veil used by the scientist\r\nto hide the Eternal and Unchangeable Will, the Personal God, the Hearer\r\nof Prayer, the Father of Creation. The kaleidoscope of nature, however\r\nrudely shaken, through all its multiplicity of fragments, forever falls\r\nback into the holy figure of God:\r\n\r\n  'Mirrors God maketh all atoms in space,\r\n   And fronteth each one with His perfect Face.'\r\n\r\nHow long, lovely, and glowing has our autumn been, with its dreamy days\r\nand soft shadowy mists. In its surpassing beauty it is peculiar to our\r\nown loved land, and thus doubly dear to the hearts of Americans. Our\r\nmountains borrowed the rainbow, dressing themselves in its changing\r\nhues, holding up the great forests, like clustered bouquets, in their\r\ngiant palms, as if offering their dying children to God in the very\r\nhour of their mature beauty. Crimsons and purples, oranges, golds,\r\nyellows, browns, greens, and scarlet dye the trees; gathered sheaves and\r\ngolden pumpkins, marguerites, feathery golden rods, and bright blue\r\ngorse are on every field. Have we not, in very truth, a country for\r\nwhich a patriot should gladly die, and the devout heart never cease to\r\nquiver in prayer that God may vouchsafe to bless?\r\n\r\nOne of our patriot poets has sent us the stirring hymn of the\r\nCumberland. Let him chant it here, while we grave in our hearts the\r\ngrateful memory of the brave crew who perished with her, martyrs in a\r\nholy cause:\r\n\r\n  THE CUMBERLAND.\r\n\r\n  Fast poured the traitors' shot and shell,\r\n  Where at their posts our gunners fell:\r\n  Our starboard portholes make reply--\r\n  Each takes his comrade's place to die;\r\n  All time shall yield no battle field\r\n      Grand as thy deck, our Cumberland!\r\n\r\n  Oh, crashing shock! our beams divide,\r\n  And death flows inward with the tide.\r\n  O'er gory decks,'mid sulphur smoke,\r\n  The climbing waters madly broke;\r\n  Our banner spread, still waved o'er head,\r\n      Above the sinking Cumberland.\r\n\r\n  The wounded cheer,--the dying wave,\r\n  While sinking to their watery grave,\r\n  With straining sight and grateful prayer,\r\n  Exultant that the Flag is there;--\r\n  Nor thought of life to glory's strife,\r\n      But of their ship, the Cumberland.\r\n\r\n  The vessel sinks;--her latest breath\r\n  Hurls through the cannons' mouth of death\r\n  Defiance at the traitor foes!\r\n  O'er guns the throttling waters close--\r\n  The hungry wave devours the brave--\r\n      The gallant crew of Cumberland!\r\n\r\n  No sailor yields; they gladly die;\r\n  Above them still the colors fly!\r\n  High o'er the black and surging flood,\r\n  That reels as drunk with patriots' blood,\r\n  Those glorious bars and Freedom's stars\r\n      Float o'er the sunken Cumberland!\r\n\r\n  Deeds like these will live forever--\r\n  Loyal hearts forget them never!\r\n  Hark! echoes from the brave and free,\r\n  Greet us from far Thermopylæ:\r\n  All time shall ring while bards shall sing\r\n      The Martyrs of the Cumberland!\r\n\r\n  In Glory's sky, 'mid heroes bright,\r\n  Immortal galaxy of light,\r\n  Through future ages shall they be,\r\n  The _Color Bearers_ of the Free!\r\n  The sleeping brave, in ocean's wave,\r\n      Who manned the Frigate Cumberland.\r\n\r\nOur monthly will enter many a home during the coming holidays--the eight\r\ndays consecrated to the memory of the most sublime record in the history\r\nof mankind, the union of the Divine with the human, the introduction of\r\na human heart into the impenetrable but truly philosophical mystery of\r\nthe Trinity. Do we ever sufficiently realize the duties which this\r\nmarvellous union has enjoined upon us, the privileges with which it has\r\nendowed us?\r\n\r\nWe shall enter many a home--some joyous with the mirth of children, the\r\nhopefulness of youth, the serene happiness of useful and contented men\r\nand women;--some shadowed by recent sorrow, where perhaps patriots, as\r\nin the olden time, learn to endure for the sake of a beloved\r\ncountry;--or others, perchance, where worldliness, discord, and egotism\r\nhave severed hearts that should be united. God grant the number of the\r\nlatter may be few! Happy should we be, could we know that our arrival\r\nwould bring one more smile to the lips of the gay, a single ray of\r\nsupport or consolation to the souls of the sorrowing--could we cause the\r\nworld-worn to dream of better and brighter things than mere matter can\r\never afford, give the thinker a pregnant thought, soothe earth's weary\r\nart-children with the hope of wider comprehension and sympathy, lead the\r\nrich to open upward paths to their poorer brethren, or the poor nobly to\r\nbear or to better their humble condition--in a word, could we offer but\r\nsingle drops of that wine of immortal life for which every human soul is\r\nthirsting.\r\n\r\nFrost and cold now are upon us; Christmas passing with its typal\r\nevergreens and mystic chants; the old year dying fast with its weird\r\nsecrets buried until the Day of Doom; the New Year close upon us, with\r\nits demands and duties. May the Heavenly Father bless its fleeting\r\nhours, and enable us to sow them closely with the precious seeds of good\r\ndeeds,--germs to blossom on the Eternal Shore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN THANKSGIVING DAY IN LONDON.\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 25, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [The following report of the proceedings at the Thanksgiving Dinner\r\n     in London arrived too late to be incorporated in the body of\r\n     THE CONTINENTAL; in consequence, however, of its immediate\r\n     interest to our readers, we have decided upon giving it to them,\r\n     even if it must appear as a supplement. It is surely a very\r\n     pleasant thing to know that our patriots abroad consecrated the\r\n     festival by grateful thanks to the Giver of all good; and that\r\n     public and loyal utterances were made of the great national truths\r\n     which, in our present crisis, it is of such vital importance to\r\n     make known to the men and governments of other countries.--ED.\r\n     CONTINENTAL.]\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the proclamation of the President of the United States,\r\naddressed to all citizens, at home and abroad, the loyal Americans now\r\nin England, to the number of several hundred, assembled at St. James\r\nHall to dinner. The Hon. Robert J. Walker presided, assisted by Hon.\r\nFreeman H. Morse (our Consul here), and Girard Ralston, Esq. On the\r\nright of Mr. Walker sat the American Minister, Mr. Adams, and on the\r\nleft, George Thompson, Esq., late M. P. from London. After the reading\r\nof the proclamation, the prayer, and the hymn, Mr. Walker addressed the\r\ncompany as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nLADIES AND GENTLEMEN: By the request of my countrymen, I shall\r\npreface the toasts prepared for the occasion, by a few introductory\r\nremarks. This day has been set apart by the President of the United\r\nStates for thanksgiving to Almighty God for all the blessings which he\r\nhas vouchsafed to us as a people. Among these are abundant crops, great\r\nprosperity in all our industrial pursuits, and a vast addition, even\r\nduring the war, to our material wealth. Our finances have been conducted\r\nwith great ability and success by the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr.\r\nChase, who has also succeeded in giving us, for the first time in our\r\nhistory, a uniform national currency, which, as a bond of union, and as\r\nan addition to our wealth and resources, is nearly equal to all the\r\nexpenses of the great contest. During the present year, nearly\r\n400,000,000 of dollars of the six per cent. stock of the United States\r\nhas been taken at home, at or above par; whilst, within the last few\r\nmonths, European capitalists, unsolicited by us, are making large\r\ninvestments in the securities of the Union. But, above all, we have to\r\nthank God for those great victories in the field, which are bringing\r\nthis great contest to a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\nThis rebellion is indeed the most stupendous in history. It absorbs the\r\nattention and affects the political institutions and material interests\r\nof the world. The armies engaged exceed those of Napoleon. Death never\r\nhad such a carnival, and each week consumes millions of treasure. Great\r\nis the sacrifice, but the cause is peerless and sublime. (_Cheers._) If\r\nGod has placed us in the van of the great contest for the rights and\r\nliberties of man, if he has assigned us the post of danger and of\r\nsuffering, it is that of unfading glory and imperishable renown. (_Loud\r\ncheers._) The question with us, which is so misunderstood here, is that\r\nof national unity (_hear, hear_), which is the vital element of our\r\nexistence; and any settlement which does not secure this with the entire\r\nintegrity of the Union, and freedom throughout all its borders, will be\r\ntreason to our country and to mankind. (_Loud cheers._) To acknowledge\r\nthe absurd and anarchical doctrine of secession, as is demanded of us\r\nhere, to abdicate the power of self-preservation, and permit the Union\r\nto be dissolved, is ruin, disgrace, and suicide. There is but one\r\nalternative--we must and will fight it out to the last. (_Loud and\r\nprolonged applause._) If need be, all who can bear arms must take the\r\nfield, and leave to those who cannot the pursuits of industry. (_Hear,\r\nhear._) If we count not the cost of this contest in men and money, it is\r\nbecause all loyal Americans believe that the value of our Union cannot\r\nbe estimated. (_Hear, hear._) If martyrs from every State, from England,\r\nand from nearly every nation of Christendom have fallen in our defence,\r\nnever, in humble faith we trust, has any blood, since that of Calvary,\r\nbeen shed in a cause so holy. (_Cheers._) Most of the rebellions which\r\nhave disturbed or overthrown governments, ave been caused by oppression\r\non their part. Such rebellions have been the rising of the oppressed\r\nagainst the oppressor; but this rebellion was caused exclusively by\r\nslavery. (_Cheers._) To extend, and perpetuate, and nationalize slavery,\r\nto demand of the American Congress the direct and explicit recognition\r\nof the right of property in man, to cover the whole vast territory of\r\nthe Union with chattel servitude, to keep open the interstate\r\nslave-trade between the Border and the Cotton States, to give the\r\ninstitution absolute mastery over the Government and people, to carry it\r\ninto every new State by fraud, and violence, and forgery, as was\r\nexemplified in Kansas, and then, as a final result, to force it upon\r\nevery Free State of the Union--these were the objects conceived by those\r\nwho are engaged in this foul conspiracy to dissolve the American Union.\r\n(_Cheers._) 'I have said that the American Union never will be\r\ndissolved.' (_Loud and continued cheers._) This was the advice of the\r\npeerless Washington, the Father of his country, in his Farewell Address,\r\nand this was the course of the immortal Andrew Jackson, when he\r\nsuppressed the Carolina rebellion of 1833, by coercion and a force bill.\r\nThe American Union is the great citadel of self-government, intrusted to\r\nour charge by Providence; and we must defend it against all assailants,\r\nuntil our last man has fallen. This is the cause of labor and humanity,\r\nand the toiling and disfranchised masses of the world feel that their\r\nfate is involved in the result of our struggle. In England, especially,\r\nthis feeling on the part of the working classes has been manifested in\r\nmore than one hundred meetings, and the resolutions in favor of the\r\nUnion, passed by the operatives of Manchester, who were the great\r\nsufferers from this contest, indicate a sublimity of feeling, and a\r\ndevotion to principle on the part of these noble martyrs, which exalt\r\nand dignify the character of man. (_Cheers._) The working classes of\r\nEngland, of France, and of Germany, who are all with us, in case of\r\nforeign intervention, must have constituted the armies that would have\r\nbeen taken to our shores to make war upon the American people. The men\r\nwho are for us would have been transported across the ocean to fight\r\nagainst us in the cause of slavery, and for the degradation of labor.\r\nCan there be any doubt as to the result of such a conflict? It is now\r\nquite certain that this rebellion will receive no foreign aid; but if\r\nany foreign despot or usurper had thus intervened and sent his myrmidons\r\nto our shores, the result, though it might have been prolonged, would\r\nhave been equally certain--he would have lost his crown, and destroyed\r\nhis dynasty. (_Cheers._) Our whole country would have been a camp, we\r\nshould have risen to the magnitude of the contest, and all who could\r\nbear arms would have taken the field. We know, as Americans, that our\r\nnational unity is the essential condition of our existence. Without it\r\nwe should be disintegrated into sections, States, counties, and cities,\r\nand ruin and anarchy would reign supreme. (_Cheers._) No, the Lakes can\r\nnever be separated from the Gulf, the Atlantic from the Pacific, the\r\nsource from the mouth of the Mississippi, nor the sons of New England\r\nfrom the home of their kindred in the great West. (_Cheers._) But, above\r\nall, the entire valley of the Mississippi was ordained by God as the\r\nresidence of a united people. Over every acre of its soil, and over\r\nevery drop of its waters, must forever float the banner of the Union\r\n(_loud applause_), and all its waters, as they roll on together to the\r\nGulf, proclaim that what 'God has joined together' man shall never 'put\r\nasunder.' (_Loud cheers._) The nation's life blood courses this vast\r\narterial system; and to sever it is death. No line of latitude or\r\nlongitude shall ever separate the mouth from the centre or sources of\r\nthe Mississippi. All the waters of the imperial river, from their\r\nmountain springs and crystal fountains, shall ever flow in commingling\r\ncurrents to the Gulf, uniting ever more, in one undivided whole, the\r\nblessed homes of a free and happy people. This great valley is one vast\r\nplain, without an intervening mountain, and can never be separated by\r\nany line but that of blood, to be followed, surely, by military\r\ndespotism. No! separation, by any line, is death; disunion is suicide.\r\nSlavery having made war upon the Union, the result is not doubtful.\r\nSlavery will die. (_Cheers._) Slavery having selected a traitor's\r\nposition, will meet a traitor's doom. (_Loud cheers._) The Union will\r\nstill live. It is written by the finger of God on the scroll of destiny,\r\nthat neither principalities nor powers shall effect its overthrow, nor\r\nshall 'the gates of hell prevail against it.' But what as to the\r\nresults? It is said that we have accomplished nothing, and this is\r\nre-echoed every morning by the proslavery press of England. We have done\r\nnothing! Why, we have conquered and now occupy two thirds of the entire\r\nterritory of the South, an area far larger (and overcoming a greater\r\nresisting force) than that traversed by the armies of Cæsar or\r\nAlexander. The whole of the Mississippi River, from its source to its\r\nmouth, with, all its tributaries, is exclusively ours. (_Cheers._) So is\r\nthe great Chesapeake Bay. Slavery is not only abolished in the Federal\r\nDistrict, containing the capital of the Union, but in all our vast\r\nterritorial domain, comprising more than eight hundred millions of\r\nacres, and nearly half the size of all Europe. The four slaveholding\r\nStates of Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, are all devotedly\r\nloyal, and thoroughly sustaining the Union. And how as to Virginia? Why,\r\nall the counties of Virginia east of the Chesapeake are ours. All that\r\nvast portion of Eastern Virginia north of the Rappahannock is ours also;\r\nbut still more, all that great territory of Virginia, from the mountains\r\nto the Ohio, is ours also, and, not only ours, but, by the overwhelming\r\nvoice of her people, has formed a State government. By their own votes\r\nthey have abolished slavery, and have been admitted as one of the Free\r\nStates of the American Union. (_Loud cheers._) And where is the great\r\ngiant State of the West--Missouri? She is not only ours, but, by an\r\noverwhelming majority of the popular vote, carried into effect by her\r\nconstitutional convention, has abolished slavery, and enrolled herself\r\nas one of the Free States of the American Union. (_Cheers._) And now as\r\nto Maryland. The last steamers bring us the news of the recent elections\r\nin Maryland, which have not only sustained the Union, but have sent an\r\noverwhelming majority to Congress and to State Legislature in favor of\r\nimmediate emancipation. (_Applause._) Tennessee also is ours. From the\r\nMississippi to the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers, from Knoxville, in\r\nthe mountains of the east, to Nashville, the capital, in the centre, and\r\nMemphis, the commercial metropolis in the west, Tennessee is wholly\r\nours. So is Arkansas; so is Louisiana, including the great city of New\r\nOrleans. So is North Alabama; so is two thirds of the State of\r\nMississippi; and now the Union troops hold Chattanooga, the great\r\nimpregnable fortress of Northwestern Georgia. From Chattanooga, which\r\nmay be regarded as the great geographical central pivotal point of the\r\nrebellion, the armies of the republic will march down through the heart\r\nof Georgia, and join our troops upon the seaboard of that State, and\r\nthus terminate the rebellion. (_Loud cheers._) Into Georgia and the\r\nCarolinas nearly half a million slaves have been driven by their\r\nmasters, in advance of the Union army. From Virginia, from Kentucky,\r\nMissouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and North\r\nAlabama, nearly all these slaves have been driven and huddled together\r\nin the two Carolinas and Georgia, because, if they had been left where\r\nthey were, they would have joined the Northern armies. They preferred to\r\nbe freemen rather than slaves; they preferred to be men and women,\r\nrather than chattels; they preferred freedom to chains and bondage; and\r\njust so soon as that Union army advances into the Carolinas and Georgia\r\nwill the slaves rush to the standard of freedom, and fight as they have\r\nfought, with undaunted courage, for liberty and Union. (_Loud\r\napplause._) But how is it with the South? Why, months ago they had\r\ncalled out by a levy _en masse_, all who were capable of bearing arms.\r\nThey have exhausted their entire military resources; they have raised\r\ntheir last army. And how as to money? Why, they are in a state of\r\nabsolute bankruptcy. Their money, all that they have, that which they\r\ncall money, according to their own estimation as fixed and taken by\r\nthemselves, one dollar of gold purchases twelve dollars of confederate\r\npaper. The price of flour is now one hundred dollars a barrel, and other\r\narticles in like proportion. No revenue is collected, or can be. The\r\narmy and the Government are supported exclusively by force, by seizing\r\nthe crops of the farms and planters, and using them for the benefit of\r\nthe so-called confederate government. Starvation is staring them in the\r\nface. The collapse is imminent; and, so far as we may venture to predict\r\nany future event, nothing can be more certain than that before the end\r\nof the coming year, the rebellion will be brought entirely to a close.\r\n(_Hear, hear._) We must recollect, also, that there is not a single\r\nState of the South in which a large majority of the population\r\n(including the blacks) is not now, and always has been, devoted to the\r\nUnion. Why, in the State of South Carolina alone, the blacks, who are\r\ndevoted to the Union, exceed the whites more than one hundred thousand\r\nin number. The recent elections have all gone for the Union by\r\noverwhelming majorities, and volunteering for the army progresses with\r\nrenewed vigor. For all these blessings the President of the United\r\nStates has asked us to render thanks to Almighty God. Our cause is that\r\nof humanity, of civilization, of Christianity. We write upon our\r\nbanners, from the inspired words of Holy Writ: 'God has made of one\r\nblood all the nations of the earth.' We acknowledge all as brothers, and\r\ninvite them to partake with us alike in the grand inheritance of\r\nfreedom; and we repeat the divine sentiment from the Sermon on the\r\nMount: 'Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.' (_Loud\r\ncheers._)\r\n\r\nNor let it be supposed that we, as Americans, are entirely selfish in\r\nthis matter. We believe that this Union is the most sacred trust ever\r\nconfided by God to man. We believe that this American Union is the best,\r\nthe brightest, the last experiment of self-government; and as it shall\r\nbe maintained and perpetuated, or broken and dissolved, the light of\r\nliberty shall beam upon the hopes of mankind, or be forever extinguished\r\namid the scoffs of exulting tyrants, and the groans of a world in\r\nbondage. (_Loud applause._) Thanking you, ladies and gentlemen, for the\r\nkind indulgence with which you have been pleased to receive these\r\nremarks, I will now proceed to the toasts which have been prepared for\r\nthe occasion. Ladies and gentlemen, the first toast will be, 'The\r\nPresident of the United States,' under whose proclamation we are this\r\nday convened. Before asking you to respond to that toast, I would say\r\nthat we are honored by the presence this evening of his excellency, the\r\nAmerican Minister, Mr. Adams. (_Prolonged applause._) This is a name for\r\na century, and during three generations most honorably and conspicuously\r\nconnected with the cause of our country and of human liberty. The\r\ngrandfather and father of our American minister were each elevated to\r\nthe presidency of the United States by the votes of the American people.\r\nThe first, the illustrious John Adams, moved in 1776 the Declaration of\r\nAmerican Independence, and supported that motion by an immortal and most\r\neloquent address. He was the successor of the peerless Washington as the\r\nPresident of the United States. The second, John Quincy Adams, eminent\r\nfor courage, for integrity, for opposition to slavery, for devotion to\r\nthe cause of liberty, for learning, science, eloquence, diplomacy, and\r\nstatesmanship, was the successor of President Monroe. His son, our\r\nhonored guest, inheriting all these great qualities and noble principles\r\nof an illustrious ancestry, is requested to respond to the first toast,\r\n'The President of the United States.' (_The toast was drunk amid the\r\nmost enthusiastic applause._)\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder of Exercises.\r\n\r\n_I.--Reading of Thanksgiving Proclamation, R.

By the Author of 'Charles Anchester,'\r\n     'Counterparts,' etc. Boston: Published by T. O. H. P. Burnham, No.\r\n     143 Washington street. New York: H. Dexter Hamilton & Co., 113\r\n     Nassau street; O. S. Felt, 36 Walker street.\r\n\r\n'Rumor' is a book of genius, but genius of a peculiar character. Gleams\r\nof intuition into the most secret recesses of the heart, analyses of\r\nhidden feelings, flash brilliantly upon us from every leaf, and yet a\r\nvague mysticism broods over all. No steady light illumes the pages;\r\nscenes and characters float before as if shrouded in mist, or dimmed by\r\ndistance. The shadowy forms, held only by the heart, shimmer and float\r\nbefore us, draped in starry veils and seen through hues of opal. We are\r\nin Dreamland, or in the fair clime of the Ideal. 'Porphyro' we know to\r\nbe Louis Napoleon, but who are 'Rodomant and Diamid?' Adelaida and\r\ndeafness would point to Beethoven, but other circumstances forbid the\r\nidentification. Nor do we think Rodomant a fair type of a musical\r\ngenius; arrogant, overbearing, and positively ill-mannered as he\r\ninvariably is. He may be true to German nature, as he is pictured as a\r\nGerman, but he is no study of the graceful Italian or elegant and suave\r\nSclavic Artist. We think the authoress unjust and cruel in her sketch of\r\nthat ethereal child of genius and suffering, Chopin. Did she study\r\nexclusively in the German schools of musical art? If Beethoven is grand\r\nand majestic, Chopin is sublime; if Beethoven is pathetic, Chopin is\r\npathos itself; if the one is broad and comprehensive, the other is high\r\nand deep; the one appealing to the soul through a noble intellect, the\r\nother reaching it through every nerve and fibre of our basic being.\r\nRubens is a great artist, but does that gainsay Raphael? Are not\r\nBeethoven and Chopin twin stars of undying glory in the musical\r\nfirmament, and can we not offer _true_ homage to _both_, as they blaze\r\nso high above us? Shall the royal purple so daze our eyes, that we\r\ncannot see the depths of heavenly blue?\r\n\r\nMeantime we advise the admirers of 'Charles Anchester' to read 'Rumor;'\r\nit is a book of wider knowledge and deeper intuitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n     GENERAL BUTLER IN NEW ORLEANS.

Longfellow, is sufficient\r\nto secure for it the attention of all who read or love poetry. Long\r\nbefore the critic can pronounce upon its merits, it will be found in the\r\nhands of thousands. Longfellow is perhaps the most popular among\r\nAmerican poets. His rhythm is always varied and musical, his diction in\r\ngood taste, his treatment ever adapted to the subject he has in hand. If\r\nhe seldom strikes the deepest chords of being, his touch is always\r\ntrue, tender, and sympathetic. 'The Birds of Killingworth' is full of\r\nbeauty. If the 'Tale of a Poet,' it is also a song of the sage. The\r\n'Children's Hour' is charming in its home love and naive grace.\r\n'Weariness' is simple as a child's song, but full of natural and true\r\npathos. Let it pleasure our poet that in this sweet, sad chant of his,\r\nhe has the warm sympathies of his fellow men. Let him not weary thinking\r\nof the task yet before the 'little feet,' but rather rejoice in the\r\nsunshine he has himself been able to throw o'er the path in which the\r\n'little feet' must walk.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE THOUGHTS OF THE EMPEROR M. AURELIUS ANTONINUS.\r\n     Translated by GEORGE LONG. Boston; Ticknor & Fields. For\r\n     sale by D. Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nAntoninus was born at Rome, A. D. 121, embraced the Stoic\r\nphilosophy from conviction, and, though an emperor, lived in accordance\r\nwith its stern spirit. This little book has been the companion of many\r\nof our greatest men. That it still lives, and is still read by all who\r\ndelight in bold and vigorous thought, is sufficient proof of its\r\nexcellence. It has been rendered into English, French, Italian, and\r\nSpanish. It was translated by Cardinal Francis Barberini, nephew of Pope\r\nUrban VIII. as he said, 'in order to diffuse among the faithful the\r\nfertilizing and vivifying seeds he found within it.' He dedicated this\r\ntranslation to his own soul, to make it, as he says, 'redder than purple\r\nat the sight of the virtues of this Gentile.' The strong pages act like\r\na tonic upon the spirit, and give the reader courage to endure.\r\n\r\n\r\n     REVERIES OF A BACHELOR; or, A Book of the Heart. By\r\n     IK. MARVEL. A new edition. New York: Charles Scribner, 124\r\n     Grand street.\r\n\r\n     DREAM LIFE: A Fable of the Seasons. By IK. MARVEL.\r\n     A new edition. Charles Scribner, 124 Grand street, New York.\r\n\r\nThe old type of these books has from constant use grown so worn and\r\nbattered as to be unfit for further use, and it has been found necessary\r\nfrom the constant demand, to issue entirely new editions. And beautiful\r\neditions indeed we have before us. Print and paper alike excellent, and\r\npleasant binding in vivid green and lustrous gold. It were surely\r\nuseless to commend Ik. Marvel now to our readers, since no one ever\r\nattained to more rapid popularity. His sketches are always graceful and\r\ngenial, his style of singular elegance. He wins his way to our heart and\r\nawakens our interest we scarcely know how, for he is marvellously\r\nunpretending and simple in his delineations of life. Our author says in\r\nhis Preface to the new edition of the 'Reveries of a Bachelor:' 'The\r\nhouses where I was accustomed to linger, show other faces at the\r\nwindows; bright and cheery faces, it is true; but they are looking over\r\nat a young fellow upon the other side of the way.'\r\n\r\nWe would whisper to him: 'Nay, not so. Humanity is ever grateful to its\r\ntrue and earnest friends, and have borne thee over in triumph to the\r\nfair clime of the Ideal, where undying affections await thee; and\r\never-yearning loves shall keep thee ever young. Spring flowers are\r\nforever blooming in our hearts as thou breathest upon them, and age is\r\nbut a name for thy immortal youth, O friend of dreamy hours and tender\r\nreveries.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     MY FARM OF EDGEWOOD: A Country Book. By the Author of\r\n     'Reveries of a Bachelor.' Eighth Edition. New York: Charles\r\n     Scribner.\r\n\r\nA book of farm experience from Ik. Marvel cannot fail to awaken the\r\ninterest of the community. If the author sees with the eye of the poet,\r\nhis imagination is no ignis-fatuus fire to mislead and bewilder him when\r\nmoving among the practical things of life. He begins with the beginning,\r\nthe search and finding of the farm. Every page is pregnant with valuable\r\nhints to the farmer as well as to the gentleman and scholar. The book is\r\na real picture of country life, its pains, trials, pursuits, and\r\npleasures, and the most varied information is given with respect to what\r\nit might be made, what it should become. A single glance at the varied\r\ntable of contents would be sufficient to convince the reader of the\r\ngreat interest of the topics so pleasantly treated in the volume before\r\nus. We extract a few of them: Around the House; My Bees; What to do with\r\nthe Farm; A Sunny Frontage; Laborers; Farm Buildings; The Cattle; The\r\nHill Land; The Farm Flat; Soiling; An Old Orchard; The Pears; My Garden;\r\nFine Tilth makes Fine Crops; Seeding and Trenching; How a Garden should\r\nlook; The lesser Fruits; Grapes; Plums, Apricots, and Peaches; The\r\nPoultry; Is it Profitable? Debit and Credit; Money-making Farmers; Does\r\nFarming Pay? Agricultural Chemistry; Isolation of Farmers; Dickering;\r\nThe Bright Side; Place for Science; Æsthetics of the Business; Walks;\r\nShrubbery; Rural Decoration; Flowers; L'Envoi.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LETTERS TO THE JONESES. By TIMOTHY TITCOMB,\r\n     Author of 'Letters to Young People,' 'Gold Foil,' 'Lessons in\r\n     Life,' etc., etc. Eighth edition. Charles Scribner, 124 Grand\r\n     street, New York.\r\n\r\nA work evincing strong practical common sense, and acute discrimination.\r\nOur author is a poet, but no mysticism or sentimentalism disfigures his\r\npages; he is a clear, keen observer and analyzer of human nature,\r\nlashing its vices, discerning its foibles, and reading its subterfuges\r\nand petty vanities. He says: 'The only apologies which he offers for\r\nappearing as a censor and a teacher, are his love of men, his honest\r\nwish to do them good, and his sad consciousness that his nominal\r\ncriticisms of others are too often actual condemnations of himself.'\r\n\r\nHe addresses himself in a series of letters to the Joneses of\r\nJonesville, each Jones addressed being a typal character and such as is\r\nof frequent occurrence in our midst. Homely and excellent advice,\r\nappropriate to their faults and needs, is administered to each\r\nindividual Jones in turn, as he falls under the salutary but sharp\r\nscalpel of this keen dissector. There are twenty-four letters,\r\nconsequently twenty-four studies from life, true to reality and detailed\r\nas a Dutch picture. We feel our own faults and foibles bared before us\r\nas we read. While these pages are very interesting to the general\r\nreader, the divine may learn from them how best in his preaching to aim\r\nhis shafts at personal follies, and the novelist find models for his\r\nliving portraitures and varied pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE WATER BABIES: a Fairy Tale for a Land Baby. By the\r\n     Rev. Charles Kingsley, Author of 'Two Years Ago,' 'Amyas Leigh,'\r\n     etc. With illustrations by J. Noel Paten, B. S. A. Boston: T. O. H.\r\n     P. Burnham. New York: O. S. Felt, 36 Walker St., 1864.\r\n\r\nA lively tale, dedicated to the author's youngest son, and calculated to\r\nentertain the elders who read aloud, as well as the children who listen.\r\nThere are in it many tender touches, and numberless satiric blows\r\nadministered in Mr. Kingsley's own peculiar way.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ADVENTURES OF DICK ONSLOW AMONG THE RED SKINS. A Book for\r\n     Boys. With Illustrations. Edited by William H. G. Kingston. Boston:\r\n     J. E. Tilton & Co. 1864.\r\n\r\nStories of the Western wilderness, and of life among the Indians, are\r\nsure to meet with favor in the eyes of American boys, the descendants of\r\na race of pioneers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MY DAYS AND NIGHTS ON THE BATTLE FIELD. A Book for Boys.\r\n     By 'Carleton.' Boston: Ticknor & Fields, 1864. For sale by D.\r\n     Appleton & Co., New York.\r\n\r\nThis is a useful book, containing sundry items of military information,\r\nand many vivid descriptions of land and naval engagements during the\r\npresent war--all interesting to young people.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LOUIE'S LAST TERM AT ST. MARY'S. By the author of\r\n     'Rutledge,' 'The Sutherlands,' 'Frank Warrington,' etc. New York:\r\n     Carleton, publisher, 413 Broadway, 1864.\r\n\r\nA book of school life, intended not less for teachers than for the\r\nyouthful maidens whose various typal forms act, love, hate, and suffer\r\nthrough its very natural and interesting pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MILTON'S PARADISE LOST. In Twelve Books. New York: Frank\r\n     H. Dodd, 506 Broadway, 1863.\r\n\r\nThe text is a literal reprint from Keightley's Library edition. Print,\r\nbinding, and size all render the tasteful little book a pleasant form in\r\nwhich to possess the greatest epic in the English tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE GAME OF DRAUGHTS. By HENRY SPAYTH, Author of\r\n     'American Draught Player.' Buffalo: Printed for the Author. For\r\n     sale by Sinclair Tousey, New York.\r\n\r\nThis book has been pronounced by the highest authorities on checkers,\r\nboth in the Old and New World, the best work of the kind ever written.\r\nIt is said to contain 'lucid instructions for beginners, laws of the\r\ngame, diagrams, the score of 364 games, together with a series of novel,\r\ninstructive, and ingenious critical positions.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     PECULIAR. A Tale of the Great Transition. By EPES\r\n     SARGENT. New York: Carleton, publisher, 413 Broadway.\r\n\r\nMr. Sargent has given us a tale of the times--his scenes are laid in our\r\nmidst. He grapples with the questions of the hour, handling even\r\nSpiritualism as he passes on. Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, George\r\nSaunders, Senator Wigfall, &c., are sketched in these pages. The story\r\nis founded on the social revelations which Gen. Butler, Gov. Shepley,\r\nGen. Ullman, the Provost-Marshal, &c., authenticated in New Orleans\r\nafter the occupation of that city by the United States forces. These\r\nmaterials have been skilfully handled by the author of 'Peculiar,' and\r\nthe result is a novel of graphic power and sustained interest. It will\r\nmake its own way, as it has the elements of success. We must, however,\r\ngive a caution to our readers: 'Kunnle Delaney Hyde' and 'Carberry\r\nRatcliff' are true as _individuals_ of the South, but it would not be\r\nfair to regard them as _typal_ characters. Let the magnanimous North be\r\njust, even to its enemies. Slavery is a great wrong, as well as a great\r\nmistake in political economy; men are by no means good enough to be\r\ntrusted with irresponsible power; slaves have been treated with savage\r\ncruelty, and the institution is indeed demoralizing: all this, and a\r\ngreat deal more, we readily grant our writer; and yet we cannot help\r\nwishing he had shown us something to love, to hope for, in our enemy. He\r\nmakes an earnest and able protest against a great wrong, and as such we\r\ngladly accept his book; but as a work of art, we think his tale would\r\nhave held a higher rank had he given us some of the softer lights of the\r\npicture. In this we may be wrong, for a dread Nemesis stalks even\r\nthrough the plains of the Ideal. To stand up truly for the Right, we\r\nmust comprehend the Wrong; meanwhile an important end is answered. We\r\nare taught, a lesson we should all learn, compassion for the negro, and\r\nenabled to understand some of his latent traits. For the ability and\r\ntenderness with which this has been done, we have reason to thank Mr.\r\nSargent. The tale of Estelle is one of pathos and beauty, and\r\n'Peculiar,' the negro, shines in it like a black diamond of the purest\r\nwater. The book cannot fail to interest all who trace the cause of the\r\nmighty transition through which we are passing to its true source, the\r\nheart of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n     POEMS BY JEAN INGELOW. Boston: Roberts Brothers.\r\n\r\nMany of these poems are vague and incomplete, others evince maturity of\r\nthought, and are of singular beauty. We are quite charmed with the\r\n'Songs of Seven.' It is highly original and tender. The rhythms vary\r\nwith the chimes of the different ages, always in tune with the joys and\r\nsorrows sung. The poem is full of nature and simple pathos. There is a\r\ndewy freshness on these leaves, as if a young soul were thus pouring its\r\nspring carols into song, Jean Ingelow has been highly commended by the\r\nEnglish critics. In regard to her poems the _London Athenæum_ says:\r\n'Here is the power to fill common earthly facts with heavenly fire; a\r\npower to gladden wisely and to sadden nobly; to shake the heart, and\r\nbring moist tears into the eyes through which the spirit may catch its\r\nloftiest light.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     ALICE OF MONMOUTH, an Idyl of the Great War, with Other\r\n     Poems. By EDMUND C. STEDMAN. New York: Carleton,\r\n     publisher, 413 Broadway. London: Sampson Low, Son & Company.\r\n\r\nWith the many stirring events passing around us, the heroic deeds\r\nenacted in our midst, it is fitting that the poet should begin to find\r\nhis scenes in his own country. Mr. Stedman has so done in his 'Alice of\r\nMonmonth.' The story of the Poem leads us from the fruit fields and\r\nplains of New Jersey, from love scenes and songs, to the din of battle,\r\nand the sufferings of hospitals in Virginia. There are various changes\r\nrung in the rhythm, so that it never becomes monotonous; and many of the\r\ndescriptive passages are full of beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n     DEEP WATERS. A Novel. By ANNA H. DRURY, Author of\r\n     'Misrepresentation,' 'Friends and Fortune,' &c. Boston: Published\r\n     by T. O. H. P. Burnham, No. 143 Washington street. New York: H.\r\n     Dexter Hamilton & Co., 113 Nassau street. O. S. Felt, 36 Walker\r\n     street.\r\n\r\nNever having before met with a work by Miss Drury, we were quite\r\nsurprised to find 'Deep Waters' a novel of so much power. The plot is\r\noriginal, and well managed throughout, the characters well conceived and\r\nsustained, the morals entirely unobjectionable, the style pure, simple,\r\nand unaffected, and the interest uninterrupted. The tale is indeed one\r\nof singular beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n     IN WAR TIME, and other Poems. By JOHN GREENLEAF\r\n     WHITTIER. Ticknor & Fields, Boston. D. Appleton & Co., New\r\n     York.\r\n\r\nIf bold, varied, musical rhythm; high and tender thought; hatred of\r\noppression; warm sympathy with suffering; correct and flowing diction;\r\nintense love of nature and power to depict her in all her moods, joined\r\nwith a glowing imagination and devout soul, entitle a man to be classed\r\nwith the great poets, then may we justly claim that glorious rank for\r\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier. All honor to him, who, while he charms our\r\nfancy and warms our heart, strengthens our souls, ennobles our views,\r\nand bears us, on the wings of his pure imagination, to the gates of\r\nheaven. We are ready to accord him the highest rank among our _living_\r\npoets. No affectations deform his lines, no conceits his thoughts, no\r\npuerilities his descriptions. His 'Huskers,' should be graven on every\r\nAmerican heart; his 'Andrew Rykman's Prayer' on that of every Christian.\r\nWe regard this poem as one of the noblest of the age. Humble devotion\r\nand heavenly grace are in its every line. We pity the being who could\r\nread it unmoved. We deem 'the world within his reach' is indeed\r\n\r\n  'Somewhat the better for his living,\r\n    And gladder for his human speech.'\r\n\r\nIt seems useless to us to commend this volume to our readers; the name\r\nof its author must be all-sufficient to attract due attention. Has not\r\nthis truly national and patriotic poet a home in every American heart?\r\nIf not, he deserves it, and we for one offer him our grateful homage.\r\nNot only shall the refined and cultivated in the coming ages praise the\r\nnoble singer, but the 'dark sad millions,' whose long 'night of wrong is\r\nbrightening into day,' shall bless him, as,\r\n\r\n  'With oar strokes timing to their song,\r\n     They weave in simple lays\r\n   The pathos of remembered wrong,\r\n     The hope of better days,--\r\n   The triumph note that Miriam sung,\r\n     The joy of uncaged birds:\r\n   Softening with Afric's mellow song\r\n     Their broken Saxon words.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     MENTAL HYGIENE. By J. RAY, M. D. Ticknor &\r\n     Fields, Boston.\r\n\r\nThis work is not offered as a systematic treatise on Mental Hygiene. Its\r\npurpose is to expose the bad effects of many customs prevalent in modern\r\nsociety, and to present practical suggestions relative to the attainment\r\nof mental soundness and vigor. Many important facts are clearly stated,\r\nand sound deductions drawn from them. The law of sympathy is clearly\r\ntraced in the propagation of tastes, aptitudes, and habits. Many curious\r\nand startling examples of its effects are detailed. The author traces\r\nthe laws of mind, exhibits the consequences that flow from obeying or\r\ndisobeying them, in a succinct and able manner. The art of preserving\r\nthe health of the mind against incidents and influences calculated to\r\ndeteriorate its qualities; the management of the bodily powers in regard\r\nto exercise, rest, food, clothing, climate; the laws of breeding, the\r\ngovernment of the passions, the sympathy with current emotions and\r\nopinions, the discipline of the intellect--all come within the scope of\r\nthe work. It is designed for the general reader, and will interest all\r\nwho care for the preservation of mental or physical health.\r\n\r\nThe subject is one of great importance in our excitable country, where\r\nso many minds are overtasked, so many brains too early stimulated, and\r\ninsanity so rapidly on the increase. We heartily commend it to all\r\nreaders interested in the subjects of which it treats.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     [Continuation of Literary Notices prepared for the present issue\r\n     unavoidably crowded out; they will however appear in our next\r\n     number.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Since the above was written, the speech of Earl Russell, in\r\nScotland, indicates a disposition on the part of the British Government\r\nto do us justice, at least in the future; and it is to be hoped that a\r\nsatisfactory adjustment of all differences on the whole matter may be\r\npeacefully made.\r\n\r\n[2] In the 'Letters to Professor Morse,' in the November number of\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL, a sentence on page 521, relating to the\r\nConfiscation Law, was left incomplete. The whole sentence should have\r\nbeen as follows: 'As to the _Confiscation_ Acts--it is enough to say\r\nthat the Constitution gives Congress power 'to declare the punishment of\r\ntreason';--_or if the constitutionality of the Confiscation law cannot\r\nbe concluded from the terms of that grant--about which there may be a\r\ndoubt--it is undoubtedly contained in the war powers vested in\r\nCongress._'\r\n\r\nI have here put in italics the clause omitted in that article, and hope\r\nmy readers will insert it in the proper place. The sentence, as thus\r\ncompleted, contains all I cared then to say on the point--my object\r\nbeing mainly to vindicate the justice and conformity to public law of\r\nthe policy of confiscation. In the present article I have gone more at\r\nlength into the question of the constitutionality of the law of\r\nCongress, and have come to the conclusions herein expressed.\r\n\r\n[3] Our whole area is more than sixty times as large as England.\r\n\r\n[4] One hundred years have elapsed since that treaty, and the London\r\n_Times_ proclaims that England will not fight for Canada now.\r\n\r\n[5] See Alison's History, chap. xxxvii, p. 269.\r\n\r\n[6] Kinglake's Crimea Invasion, p. 250.\r\n\r\n[7] Kinglake.\r\n\r\n[8] See Kinglake's remarks on the design of Louis Napoleon in making St.\r\nArnaud commander-in-chief of the French army in the Crimean war, p. 321.\r\n\r\n[9] Written in August, 1863.\r\n\r\n[10] Pansclavism\r\n\r\n[11] The following story, in substance, is to be found in Joinville's\r\nMemoirs.\r\n\r\n[12] There may be extreme cases, few and far between, when the evil\r\ncontained in laws may justify their overthrow by revolutionary\r\nforce--witness our own separation from Great Britain; but the doctrine\r\nis one most unsafe when lightly broached, and we doubt not the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States offer a basis broad enough\r\nfor the legal as well as the most judicious mode of settlement under the\r\npresent difficulties.--ED.
