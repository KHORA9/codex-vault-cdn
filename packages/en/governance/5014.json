The\r\nabundant fruits of the earth have filled it with plenty. An extensive and\r\nprofitable commerce has greatly augmented our revenue. The public credit\r\nhas attained an extraordinary elevation. Our preparations for defense in\r\ncase of future wars, from which, by the experience of all nations, we ought\r\nnot to expect to be exempted, are advancing under a well-digested system\r\nwith all the dispatch which so important a work will admit. Our free\r\nGovernment, founded on the interest and affections of the people, has\r\ngained and is daily gaining strength. Local jealousies are rapidly yielding\r\nto more generous, enlarged, and enlightened views of national policy. For\r\nadvantages so numerous and highly important it is our duty to unite in\r\ngrateful acknowledgements to that Omnipotent Being from whom they are\r\nderived, and in unceasing prayer that He will endow us with virtue and\r\nstrength to maintain and hand them down in their utmost purity to our\r\nlatest posterity.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that an arrangement which had been\r\ncommenced by my predecessor with the British Government for the reduction\r\nof the naval force by Great Britain and the United States on the Lakes has\r\nbeen concluded, by which it is provided that neither party shall keep in\r\nservice on Lake Champlain more than one vessel, on Lake Ontario more than\r\none, and on Lake Erie and the upper lakes more than two, to be armed each\r\nwith one cannon only, and that all the other armed vessels of both parties,\r\nof which an exact list is interchanged, shall be dismantled. It is also\r\nagreed that the force retained shall be restricted in its duty to the\r\ninternal purposes of each party, and that the arrangement shall remain in\r\nforce until six months shall have expired after notice given by one of the\r\nparties to the other of its desire that it should terminate. By this\r\narrangement useless expense on both sides and, what is of still greater\r\nimportance, the danger of collision between armed vessels in those inland\r\nwaters, which was great, is prevented.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction also to state that the commissioners under the\r\nfourth article of the treaty of Ghent, to whom it was referred to decide to\r\nwhich party the several islands in the bay of Passamaquoddy belonged under\r\nthe treaty of 1783, have agreed in a report, by which all the islands in\r\nthe possession of each party before the late war have been decreed to it.\r\nThe commissioners acting under the other articles of the treaty of Ghent\r\nfor the settlement of boundaries have also been engaged in the discharge of\r\ntheir respective duties, but have not yet completed them.\r\n\r\nThe difference which arose between the two Governments under that treaty\r\nrespecting the right of the US to take and cure fish on the coast of the\r\nBritish provinces north of our limits, which had been secured by the treaty\r\nof 1783, is still in negotiation. The proposition made by this Government\r\nto extend to the colonies of Great Britain the principle of the convention\r\nof London, by which the commerce between the ports of the United States\r\nand British ports in Europe had been placed on a footing of equality, has\r\nbeen declined by the British Government. This subject having been thus\r\namicably discussed between the two Governments, and it appearing that\r\nthe British Government is unwilling to depart from its present\r\nregulations, it remains for Congress to decide whether they will make\r\nany other regulations in consequence thereof for the protection and\r\nimprovement of our navigation.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation with Spain for spoliations on our commerce and the\r\nsettlement of boundaries remains essentially in the state it held by the\r\ncommunications that were made to Congress by my predecessor. It has been\r\nevidently the policy of the Spanish Government to keep the negotiation\r\nsuspended, and in this the United States have acquiesced, from an amicable\r\ndisposition toward Spain and in the expectation that her Government would,\r\nfrom a sense of justice, finally accede to such an arrangement as would be\r\nequal between the parties. A disposition has been lately shown by the\r\nSpanish Government to move in the negotiation, which has been met by this\r\nGovernment, and should the conciliatory and friendly policy which has\r\ninvariably guided our councils be reciprocated, a just and satisfactory\r\narrangement may be expected. It is proper, however, to remark that no\r\nproposition has yet been made from which such a result can be presumed.\r\n\r\nIt was anticipated at an early stage that the contest between Spain and the\r\ncolonies would become highly interesting to the United States. It was\r\nnatural that our citizens should sympathize in events which affected their\r\nneighbors. It seemed probable also that the prosecution of the conflict\r\nalong our coast and in contiguous countries would occasionally interrupt\r\nour commerce and otherwise affect the persons and property of our citizens.\r\nThese anticipations have been realized. Such injuries have been received\r\nfrom persons acting under authority of both the parties, and for which\r\nredress has in most instances been withheld.\r\n\r\nThrough every stage of the conflict the United States have maintained an\r\nimpartial neutrality, giving aid to neither of the parties in men, money,\r\nships, or munitions of war. They have regarded the contest not in the light\r\nof an ordinary insurrection or rebellion, but as a civil war between\r\nparties nearly equal, having as to neutral powers equal rights. Our ports\r\nhave been open to both, and every article the fruit of our soil or of the\r\nindustry of our citizens which either was permitted to take has been\r\nequally free to the other. Should the colonies establish their\r\nindependence, it is proper now to state that this Government neither seeks\r\nnor would accept from them any advantage in commerce or otherwise which\r\nwill not be equally open to all other nations. The colonies will in that\r\nevent become independent states, free from any obligation to or connection\r\nwith us which it may not then be their interest to form on the basis of a\r\nfair reciprocity.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the present year an expedition was set on foot against\r\nEast Florida by persons claiming to act under the authority of some of the\r\ncolonies, who took possession of Amelia Island, at the mouth of the St.\r\nMarys River, near the boundary of the State of Georgia. As this Province\r\nlies eastward of the Mississippi, and is bounded by the United States and\r\nthe ocean on every side, and has been a subject of negotiation with the\r\nGovernment of Spain as an indemnity for losses by spoliation or in exchange\r\nfor territory of equal value westward of the Mississippi, a fact well known\r\nto the world, it excited surprise that any countenance should be given to\r\nthis measure by any of the colonies.\r\n\r\nAs it would be difficult to reconcile it with the friendly relations\r\nexisting between the United States and the colonies, a doubt was\r\nentertained whether it had been authorized by them, or any of them. This\r\ndoubt has gained strength by the circumstances which have unfolded\r\nthemselves in the prosecution of the enterprise, which have marked it as a\r\nmere private, unauthorized adventure. Projected and commenced with an\r\nincompetent force, reliance seems to have been placed on what might be\r\ndrawn, in defiance of our laws, from within our limits; and of late, as\r\ntheir resources have failed, it has assumed a more marked character of\r\nunfriendliness to us, the island being made a channel for the illicit\r\nintroduction of slaves from Africa into the United States, an asylum for\r\nfugitive slaves from the neighboring States, and a port for smuggling of\r\nevery kind.\r\n\r\nA similar establishment was made at an earlier period by persons of the\r\nsame description in the Gulf of Mexico at a place called Galvezton, within\r\nthe limits of the United States, as we contend, under the cession of\r\nLouisiana. This enterprise has been marked in a more signal manner by all\r\nthe objectionable circumstances which characterized the other, and more\r\nparticularly by the equipment of privateers which have annoyed our\r\ncommerce, and by smuggling. These establishments, if ever sanctioned by any\r\nauthority whatever, which is not believed, have abused their trust and\r\nforfeited all claim to consideration. A just regard for the rights and\r\ninterests of the United States required that they should be suppressed, and\r\norders have been accordingly issued to that effect. The imperious\r\nconsiderations which produced this measure will be explained to the parties\r\nwhom it may in any degree concern.\r\n\r\nTo obtain correct information on every subject in which the United States\r\nare interested; to inspire just sentiments in all persons in authority, on\r\neither side, of our friendly disposition so far as it may comport with an\r\nimpartial neutrality, and to secure proper respect to our commerce in every\r\nport and from every flag, it has been thought proper to send a ship of war\r\nwith three distinguished citizens along the southern coast with these\r\npurposes. With the existing authorities, with those in the possession of\r\nand exercising the sovereignty, must the communication be held; from them\r\nalone can redress for past injuries committed by persons acting under them\r\nbe obtained; by them alone can the commission of the like in future be\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the other powers of Europe have experienced no essential\r\nchange since the last session. In our intercourse with each due attention\r\ncontinues to be paid to the protection of our commerce, and to every other\r\nobject in which the United States are interested. A strong hope is\r\nentertained that, by adhering to the maxims of a just, a candid, and\r\nfriendly policy, we may long preserve amicable relations with all the\r\npowers of Europe on conditions advantageous and honorable to our country.\r\n\r\nWith the Barbary States and the Indian tribes our pacific relations have\r\nbeen preserved.\r\n\r\nIn calling your attention to the internal concerns of our country the view\r\nwhich they exhibit is peculiarly gratifying. The payments which have been\r\nmade into the Treasury show the very productive state of the public\r\nrevenue. After satisfying the appropriations made by law for the support of\r\nthe civil Government and of the military and naval establishments,\r\nembracing suitable provision for fortifications and for the gradual\r\nincrease of the Navy, paying the interest of the public debt, and\r\nextinguishing more than $18 millions of the principal, within the present\r\nyear, it is estimated that a balance of more than $6 millions will remain\r\nin the Treasury on the first day of January applicable to the current\r\nservice of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nThe payments into the Treasury during the year 1818 on account of imposts\r\nand tonnage, resulting principally from duties which have accrued in the\r\npresent year, may be fairly estimated at $20 millions; the internal\r\nrevenues at $2.5 millions; the public lands at $1.5 millions; bank\r\ndividends and incidental receipts at $500,000; making in the whole $24.5\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nThe annual permanent expenditure for the support of the civil Government\r\nand of the Army and Navy, as now established by law, amounts to $11.8\r\nmillions, and for the sinking fund to $10 millions, making in the whole\r\n$21.8 millions, leaving an annual excess of revenue beyond the expenditure\r\nof $2.7 millions, exclusive of the balance estimated to be in the Treasury\r\non the first day of January, 1818.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of the Treasury the whole of the Louisiana debt may be\r\nredeemed in the year 1819, after which, if the public debt continues as it\r\nnow is, above par, there will be annually about $5 millions of the sinking\r\nfund unexpended until the year 1825, when the loan of 1812 and the stock\r\ncreated by funding Treasury notes will be redeemable.\r\n\r\nIt is also estimated that the Mississippi stock will be discharged during\r\nthe year 1819 from the proceeds of the public lands assigned to that\r\nobject, after which the receipts from those lands will annually add to the\r\npublic revenue the sum of $1.5 millions, making the permanent annual\r\nrevenue amount to $26 millions, and leaving an annual excess of revenue\r\nafter the year 1819 beyond the permanent authorized expenditure of more\r\nthan $4 millions.\r\n\r\nBy the last returns to the Department of War the militia force of the\r\nseveral States may be estimated at 800,000 men--infantry, artillery, and\r\ncavalry. Great part of this force is armed, and measures are taken to arm\r\nthe whole. An improvement in the organization and discipline of the militia\r\nis one of the great objects which claims the unremitted attention of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe regular force amounts nearly to the number required by law, and is\r\nstationed along the Atlantic and inland frontiers.\r\n\r\nOf the naval force it has been necessary to maintain strong squadrons in\r\nthe Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nFrom several of the Indian tribes inhabiting the country bordering on Lake\r\nErie purchases have been made of lands on conditions very favorable to the\r\nUnited States, and, as it is presumed, not less so to the tribes\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nBy these purchases the Indian title, with moderate reservations, has been\r\nextinguished to the whole of the land within the limits of the State of\r\nOhio, and to a part of that in the Michigan Territory and of the State of\r\nIndiana. From the Cherokee tribe a tract has been purchased in the State of\r\nGeorgia and an arrangement made by which, in exchange for lands beyond the\r\nMississippi, a great part, if not the whole, of the land belonging to that\r\ntribe eastward of that river in the States of North Carolina, Georgia, and\r\nTennessee, and in the Alabama Territory will soon be acquired. By these\r\nacquisitions, and others that may reasonably be expected soon to follow, we\r\nshall be enabled to extend our settlements from the inhabited parts of the\r\nState of Ohio along Lake Erie into the Michigan Territory, and to connect\r\nour settlements by degrees through the State of Indiana and the Illinois\r\nTerritory to that of Missouri. A similar and equally advantageous effect\r\nwill soon be produced to the south, through the whole extent of the States\r\nand territory which border on the waters emptying into the Mississippi and\r\nthe Mobile.\r\n\r\nIn this progress, which the rights of nature demand and nothing can\r\nprevent, marking a growth rapid and gigantic, it is our duty to make new\r\nefforts for the preservation, improvement, and civilization of the native\r\ninhabitants. The hunter state can exist only in the vast uncultivated\r\ndesert. It yields to the more dense and compact form and greater force of\r\ncivilized population; and of right it ought to yield, for the earth was\r\ngiven to mankind to support the greatest number of which it is capable, and\r\nno tribe or people have a right to withhold from the wants of others more\r\nthan is necessary for their own support and comfort.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that the reservations of land made by the treaties\r\nwith the tribes on Lake Erie were made with a view to individual ownership\r\namong them and to the cultivation of the soil by all, and that an annual\r\nstipend has been pledged to supply their other wants. It will merit the\r\nconsideration of Congress whether other provision not stipulated by treaty\r\nought to be made for these tribes and for the advancement of the liberal\r\nand humane policy of the United States toward all the tribes within our\r\nlimits, and more particularly for their improvement in the arts of\r\ncivilized life.\r\n\r\nAmong the advantages incident to these purchases, and to those which have\r\npreceded, the security which may thereby be afforded to our inland\r\nfrontiers is peculiarly important. With a strong barrier, consisting of our\r\nown people, thus planted on the Lakes, the Mississippi, and the Mobile,\r\nwith the protection to be derived from the regular force, Indian\r\nhostilities, if they do not altogether cease, will henceforth lose their\r\nterror. Fortifications in those quarters to any extent will not be\r\nnecessary, and the expense of attending them may be saved. A people\r\naccustomed to the use of firearms only, as the Indian tribes are, will shun\r\neven moderate works which are defended by cannon. Great fortifications will\r\ntherefore be requisite only in future along the coast and at some points in\r\nthe interior connected with it. On these will the safety of our towns and\r\nthe commerce of our great rivers, from the Bay of Fundy to the Mississippi,\r\ndepend. On these, therefore, should the utmost attention, skill, and labor\r\nbe bestowed.\r\n\r\nA considerable and rapid augmentation in the value of all the public lands,\r\nproceeding from these and other obvious cases, may henceforward be\r\nexpected. The difficulties attending early emigrations will be dissipated\r\neven in the most remote parts. Several new States have been admitted into\r\nour Union to the west and south, and Territorial governments, happily\r\norganized, established over every other portion in which there is vacant\r\nland for sale. In terminating Indian hostilities, as must soon be done, in\r\na formidable shape at least, the emigration, which has heretofore been\r\ngreat, will probably increase, and the demand for land and the augmentation\r\nin its value be in like proportion.\r\n\r\nThe great increase of our population throughout the Union will alone\r\nproduce an important effect, and in no quarter will it be so sensibly felt\r\nas in those in contemplation. The public lands are a public stock, which\r\nought to be disposed of to the best advantage for the nation. The nation\r\nshould therefore derive the profit proceeding from the continual rise in\r\ntheir value. Every encouragement should be given to the emigrants\r\nconsistent with a fair competition between them, but that competition\r\nshould operate in the first sale to the advantage of the nation rather than\r\nof individuals.\r\n\r\nGreat capitalists will derive the benefit incident to their superior wealth\r\nunder any mode of sale which may be adopted, but if, looking forward to the\r\nrise in the value of the public lands, they should have the opportunity of\r\namassing at a low price vast bodies in their hands, the profit will accrue\r\nto them and not to the public. They would also have the power in that\r\ndegree to control the emigration and settlement in such a manner as their\r\nopinion of their respective interests might dictate. I submit this subject\r\nto the consideration of Congress, that such further provision may be made\r\nin the sale of the public lands, with a view to the public interest, should\r\nany be deemed expedient, as in their judgment may be best adapted to the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the vast extent of territory within the United States, the\r\ngreat amount and value of its productions, the connection of its parts, and\r\nother circumstances on which their prosperity and happiness depend, we can\r\nnot fail to entertain a high sense of the advantage to be derived from the\r\nfacility which may be afforded in the intercourse between them by means of\r\ngood roads and canals. Never did a country of such vast extent offer equal\r\ninducements to improvements of this kind, nor ever were consequences of\r\nsuch magnitude involved in them. As this subject was acted on by Congress\r\nat the last session, and there may be a disposition to revive it at the\r\npresent, I have brought it into view for the purpose of communicating my\r\nsentiments on a very important circumstance connected with it with that\r\nfreedom and candor which a regard for the public interest and a proper\r\nrespect for Congress require.\r\n\r\nA difference of opinion has existed from the first formation of our\r\nConstitution to the present time among our most enlightened and virtuous\r\ncitizens respecting the right of Congress to establish such a system of\r\nimprovement. Taking into view the trust with which I am now honored, it\r\nwould be improper after what has passed that this discussion should be\r\nrevived with an uncertainty of my opinion respecting the right.\r\nDisregarding early impressions I have bestowed on the subject all the\r\ndeliberation which its great importance and a just sense of my duty\r\nrequired, and the result is a settled conviction in my mind that Congress\r\ndo not possess the right. It is not contained in any of the specified\r\npowers granted to Congress, nor can I consider it incidental to or a\r\nnecessary means, viewed on the most liberal scale, for carrying into effect\r\nany of the powers which are specifically granted.\r\n\r\nIn communicating this result I can not resist the obligation which I feel\r\nto suggest to Congress the propriety of recommending to the States the\r\nadoption of an amendment to the Constitution which shall give to Congress\r\nthe right in question. In cases of doubtful construction, especially of\r\nsuch vital interest, it comports with the nature and origin of our\r\ninstitutions, and will contribute much to preserve them, to apply to our\r\nconstituents for an explicit grant of the power. We may confidently rely\r\nthat if it appears to their satisfaction that the power is necessary, it\r\nwill always be granted.\r\n\r\nIn this case I am happy to observe that experience has afforded the most\r\nample proof of its utility, and that the benign spirit of conciliation and\r\nharmony which now manifests itself throughout our Union promises to such a\r\nrecommendation the most prompt and favorable result. I think proper to\r\nsuggest also, in case this measure is adopted, that it be recommended to\r\nthe States to include in the amendment sought a right in Congress to\r\ninstitute likewise seminaries of learning, for the all-important purpose of\r\ndiffusing knowledge among our fellow-citizens throughout the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOur manufactories will require the continued attention of Congress. The\r\ncapital employed in them is considerable, and the knowledge acquired in the\r\nmachinery and fabric of all the most useful manufactures is of great value.\r\nTheir preservation, which depends on due encouragement, is connected with\r\nthe high interests of the nation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the progress of the public buildings has been as favorable as\r\ncircumstances have permitted, it is to be regretted that the Capitol is not\r\nyet in a state to receive you. There is good cause to presume that the two\r\nwings, the only parts as yet commenced, will be prepared for that purpose\r\nat the next session. The time seems now to have arrived when this subject\r\nmay be deemed worthy the attention of Congress on a scale adequate to\r\nnational purposes. The completion of the middle building will be necessary\r\nto the convenient accommodation of Congress, of the committees, and various\r\noffices belonging to it.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the other public buildings are altogether insufficient\r\nfor the accommodation of the several Executive Departments, some of whom\r\nare much crowded and even subjected to the necessity of obtaining it in\r\nprivate buildings at some distance from the head of the Department, and\r\nwith inconvenience to the management of the public business.\r\n\r\nMost nations have taken an interest and a pride in the improvement and\r\nornament of their metropolis, and none were more conspicuous in that\r\nrespect than the ancient republics. The policy which dictated the\r\nestablishment of a permanent residence for the National Government and the\r\nspirit in which it was commenced and has been prosecuted show that such\r\nimprovement was thought worthy the attention of this nation. Its central\r\nposition, between the northern and southern extremes of our Union, and its\r\napproach to the west at the head of a great navigable river which\r\ninterlocks with the Western waters, prove the wisdom of the councils which\r\nestablished it.\r\n\r\nNothing appears to be more reasonable and proper than that convenient\r\naccommodation should be provided on a well-digested plan for the heads of\r\nthe several Departments and for the Attorney-General, and it is believed\r\nthat the public ground in the city applied to these objects will be found\r\namply sufficient. I submit this subject to the consideration of Congress,\r\nthat such further provision may be made in it as to them may seem proper.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the happy situation of the United States, our attention\r\nis drawn with peculiar interest to the surviving officers and soldiers of\r\nour Revolutionary army, who so eminently contributed by their services to\r\nlay its foundation. Most of those very meritorious citizens have paid the\r\ndebt of nature and gone to repose. It is believed that among the survivors\r\nthere are some not provided for by existing laws, who are reduced to\r\nindigence and even to real distress. These men have a claim on the\r\ngratitude of their country, and it will do honor to their country to\r\nprovide for them. The lapse of a few years more and the opportunity will be\r\nforever lost; indeed, so long already has been the interval that the number\r\nto be benefitted by any provision which may be made will not be great.\r\n\r\nIt appearing in a satisfactory manner that the revenue arising from imposts\r\nand tonnage and from the sale of the public lands will be fully adequate to\r\nthe support of the civil Government, of the present military and naval\r\nestablishments, including the annual augmentation of the latter to the\r\nextent provided for, to the payment of the interest of the public debt, and\r\nto the extinguishment of it at the times authorized, without the aid of the\r\ninternal taxes, I consider it my duty to recommend to Congress their\r\nrepeal.\r\n\r\nTo impose taxes when the public exigencies require them is an obligation of\r\nthe most sacred character, especially with a free people. The faithful\r\nfulfillment of it is among the highest proofs of their value and capacity\r\nfor self-government. To dispense with taxes when it may be done with\r\nperfect safety is equally the duty of their representatives.\r\n\r\nIn this instance we have the satisfaction to know that they were imposed\r\nwhen the demand was imperious, and have been sustained with exemplary\r\nfidelity. I have to add that however gratifying it may be to me regarding\r\nthe prosperous and happy condition of our country to recommend the repeal\r\nof these taxes at this time, I shall nevertheless be attentive to events,\r\nand, should any future emergency occur, be not less prompt to suggest such\r\nmeasures and burdens as may then be requisite and proper.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Monroe\r\nNovember 16, 1818\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe auspicious circumstances under which you will commence the duties of\r\nthe present session will lighten the burdens inseparable from the high\r\ntrust committed to you. The fruits of the earth have been unusually\r\nabundant, commerce has flourished, the revenue has exceeded the most\r\nfavorable anticipation, and peace and amity are preserved with foreign\r\nnations on conditions just and honorable to our country. For these\r\ninestimable blessings we can not but be grateful to that Providence which\r\nwatches over the destiny of nations.\r\n\r\nAs the term limited for the operation of the commercial convention with\r\nGreat Britain will expire early in the month of July next, and it was\r\ndeemed important that there should be no interval during which that portion\r\nof our commerce which was provided for by that convention should not be\r\nregulated, either by arrangement between the two Governments or by the\r\nauthority of Congress, the minister of the United States at London was\r\ninstructed early in the last summer to invite the attention of the British\r\nGovernment to the subject, with a view to that object. He was instructed to\r\npropose also that the negotiation which it was wished to open might extend\r\nto the general commerce of the two countries, and to every other interest\r\nand unsettled difference between them in the hope that an arrangement might\r\nbe made on principles of reciprocal advantage which might comprehend and\r\nprovide in a satisfactory manner for all these high concerns.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to state that the proposal was received by the\r\nBritish Government in the spirit which prompted it, and that a negotiation\r\nhas been opened at London embracing all these objects. On full\r\nconsideration of the great extent and magnitude of the trust it was thought\r\nproper to commit it to not less than two of our distinguished citizens, and\r\nin consequence the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the\r\nUnited States at Paris has been associated with our envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary at London, to both of whom corresponding\r\ninstructions have been given, and they are now engaged in the discharge of\r\nits duties. It is proper to add that to prevent any inconvenience resulting\r\nfrom the delay incident to a negotiation on so many important subjects it\r\nwas agreed before entering on it that the existing convention should be\r\ncontinued for a term not less than eight years.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Spain remain nearly in the state in which they were at\r\nthe close of the last session. The convention of 1802, providing for the\r\nadjustment of a certain portion of the claims of our citizens for injuries\r\nsustained by spoliation, and so long suspended by the Spanish Government,\r\nhas at length been ratified by it, but no arrangement has yet been made for\r\nthe payment of another portion of like claims, not less extensive or well\r\nfounded, or for other classes of claims, or for the settlement of\r\nboundaries. These subjects have again been brought under consideration in\r\nboth countries, but no agreement has been entered into respecting them.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time events have occurred which clearly prove the ill effect of\r\nthe policy which that Government has so long pursued on the friendly\r\nrelations of the two countries, which it is presumed is at least of as much\r\nimportance to Spain as to the United States to maintain. A state of things\r\nhas existed in the Floridas the tendency of which has been obvious to all\r\nwho have paid the slightest attention to the progress of affairs in that\r\nquarter. Throughout the whole of those Provinces to which the Spanish title\r\nextends the Government of Spain has scarcely been felt. Its authority has\r\nbeen confined almost exclusively to the walls of Pensacola and St.\r\nAugustine, within which only small garrisons have been maintained.\r\nAdventurers from every country, fugitives from justice, and absconding\r\nslaves have found an asylum there. Several tribes of Indians, strong in the\r\nnumber of their warriors, remarkable for their ferocity, and whose\r\nsettlements extend to our limits, inhabit those Provinces.\r\n\r\nThese different hordes of people, connected together, disregarding on the\r\none side the authority of Spain, and protected on the other by an imaginary\r\nline which separates Florida from the United States, have violated our laws\r\nprohibiting the introduction of slaves, have practiced various frauds on\r\nour revenue, and committed every kind of outrage on our peaceable citizens\r\nwhich their proximity to us enabled them to perpetrate.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Amelia Island last year by a small band of adventurers, not\r\nexceeding one hundred and fifty in number, who wrested it from the\r\ninconsiderable Spanish force stationed there, and held it several months,\r\nduring which a single feeble effort only was made to recover it, which\r\nfailed, clearly proves how completely extinct the Spanish authority had\r\nbecome, as the conduct of those adventurers while in possession of the\r\nisland as distinctly shows the pernicious purposes for which their\r\ncombination had been formed.\r\n\r\nThis country had, in fact, become the theater of every species of lawless\r\nadventure. With little population of its own, the Spanish authority almost\r\nextinct, and the colonial governments in a state of revolution, having no\r\npretension to it, and sufficiently employed in their own concerns, it was\r\nin great measure derelict, and the object of cupidity to every adventurer.\r\nA system of buccaneering was rapidly organizing over it which menaced in\r\nits consequences the lawful commerce of every nation, and particularly the\r\nUnited States, while it presented a temptation to every people, on whose\r\nseduction its success principally depended.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the United States, the pernicious effect of this unlawful\r\ncombination was not confined to the ocean; the Indian tribes have\r\nconstituted the effective force in Florida. With these tribes these\r\nadventurers had formed at an early period a connection with a view to avail\r\nthemselves of that force to promote their own projects of accumulation and\r\naggrandizement. It is to the interference of some of these adventurers, in\r\nmisrepresenting the claims and titles of the Indians to land and in\r\npracticing on their savage propensities, that the Seminole war is\r\nprincipally to be traced. Men who thus connect themselves with savage\r\ncommunities and stimulate them to war, which is always attended on their\r\npart with acts of barbarity the most shocking, deserve to be viewed in a\r\nworse light than the savages. They would certainly have no claim to an\r\nimmunity from the punishment which, according to the rules of warfare\r\npracticed by the savages, might justly be inflicted on the savages\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIf the embarrassments of Spain prevented her from making an indemnity to\r\nour citizens for so long a time from her treasury for their losses by\r\nspoliation and otherwise, it was always in her power to have provided it by\r\nthe cession of this territory. Of this her Government has been repeatedly\r\napprised, and the cession was the more to have been anticipated as Spain\r\nmust have known that in ceding it she would likewise relieve herself from\r\nthe important obligation secured by the treaty of 1795 and all other\r\ncompromitments respecting it. If the United States, from consideration of\r\nthese embarrassments, declined pressing their claims in a spirit of\r\nhostility, the motive ought at least to have been duly appreciated by the\r\nGovernment of Spain. It is well known to her Government that other powers\r\nhave made to the United States an indemnity for like losses sustained by\r\ntheir citizens at the same epoch.\r\n\r\nThere is nevertheless a limit beyond which this spirit of amity and\r\nforbearance can in no instance be justified. If it was proper to rely on\r\namicable negotiation for an indemnity for losses, it would not have been so\r\nto have permitted the inability of Spain to fulfill her engagements and to\r\nsustain her authority in the Floridas to be perverted by foreign\r\nadventurers and savages to purposes so destructive to the lives of our\r\nfellow citizens and the highest interests of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe right of self defense never ceases. It is among the most sacred, and\r\nalike necessary to nations and to individuals, and whether the attack be\r\nmade by Spain herself or by those who abuse her power, its obligation is\r\nnot the less strong.\r\n\r\nThe invaders of Amelia Island had assumed a popular and respected title\r\nunder which they might approach and wound us. As their object was\r\ndistinctly seen, and the duty imposed on the Executive by an existing law\r\nwas profoundly felt, that mask was not permitted to protect them. It was\r\nthought incumbent on the United States to suppress the establishment, and\r\nit was accordingly done. The combination in Florida for the unlawful\r\npurposes stated, the acts perpetrated by that combination, and, above all,\r\nthe incitement of the Indians to massacre our fellow citizens of every age\r\nand of both sexes, merited a like treatment and received it.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing these savages to an imaginary line in the woods it would have\r\nbeen the height of folly to have suffered that line to protect them. Had\r\nthat been done the war could never cease. Even if the territory had been\r\nexclusively that of Spain and her power complete over it, we had a right by\r\nthe law of nations to follow the enemy on it and to subdue him there. But\r\nthe territory belonged, in a certain sense at least, to the savage enemy\r\nwho inhabited it; the power of Spain had ceased to exist over it, and\r\nprotection was sought under her title by those who had committed on our\r\ncitizens hostilities which she was bound by treaty to have prevented, but\r\nhad not the power to prevent. To have stopped at that line would have given\r\nnew encouragement to these savages and new vigor to the whole combination\r\nexisting there in the prosecution of all its pernicious purposes.\r\n\r\nIn suppressing the establishment at Amelia Island no unfriendliness was\r\nmanifested toward Spain, because the post was taken from a force which had\r\nwrested it from her. The measure, it is true, was not adopted in concert\r\nwith the Spanish Government or those in authority under it, because in\r\ntransactions connected with the war in which Spain and the colonies are\r\nengaged it was thought proper in doing justice to the United States to\r\nmaintain a strict impartiality toward both the belligerent parties without\r\nconsulting or acting in concert with either. It gives me pleasure to state\r\nthat the Governments of Buenos Ayres and Venezuela, whose names were\r\nassumed, have explicitly disclaimed all participation in those measures,\r\nand even the knowledge of them until communicated by this Government, and\r\nhave also expressed their satisfaction that a course of proceedings had\r\nbeen suppressed which if justly imputable to them would dishonor their\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIn authorizing Major-General Jackson to enter Florida in pursuit of the\r\nSeminoles care was taken not to encroach on the rights of Spain. I regret\r\nto have to add that in executing this order facts were disclosed respecting\r\nthe conduct of the officers of Spain in authority there in encouraging the\r\nwar, furnishing munitions of war and other supplies to carry it on, and in\r\nother acts not less marked which evinced their participation in the hostile\r\npurposes of that combination and justified the confidence with which it\r\ninspired the savages that by those officers they would be protected.\r\n\r\nA conduct so incompatible with the friendly relations existing between the\r\ntwo countries, particularly with the positive obligations of the 5th\r\narticle of the treaty of 1795, by which Spain was bound to restrain, even\r\nby force, those savages from acts of hostility against the United States,\r\ncould not fail to excite surprise. The commanding general was convinced\r\nthat he should fail in his object, that he should in effect accomplish\r\nnothing, if he did not deprive those savages of the resource on which they\r\nhad calculated and of the protection on which they had relied in making the\r\nwar. As all the documents relating to this occurrence will be laid before\r\nCongress, it is not necessary to enter into further detail respecting it.\r\n\r\nAlthough the reasons which induced Major-General Jackson to take these\r\nposts were duly appreciated, there was nevertheless no hesitation in\r\ndeciding on the course which it became the Government to pursue. As there\r\nwas reason to believe that the commanders of these posts had violated their\r\ninstructions, there was no disposition to impute to their Government a\r\nconduct so unprovoked and hostile. An order was in consequence issued to\r\nthe general in command there to deliver the posts--Pensacola\r\nunconditionally to any person duly authorized to receive it, and St. Marks,\r\nwhich is in the heart of the Indian country, on the arrival of a competent\r\nforce to defend it against those savages and their associates.\r\n\r\nIn entering Florida to suppress this combination no idea was entertained of\r\nhostility to Spain, and however justifiable the commanding general was, in\r\nconsequence of the misconduct of the Spanish officers, in entering St.\r\nMarks and Pensacola to terminate it by proving to the savages and their\r\nassociates that they should not be protected even there, yet the amicable\r\nrelations existing between the United States and Spain could not be altered\r\nby that act alone. By ordering the restitution of the posts those relations\r\nwere preserved. To a change of them the power of the Executive is deemed\r\nincompetent; it is vested in Congress only.\r\n\r\nBy this measure, so promptly taken, due respect was shown to the Government\r\nof Spain. The misconduct of her officers has not been imputed to her. She\r\nwas enabled to review with candor her relations with the United States and\r\nher own situation, particularly in respect to the territory in question,\r\nwith the dangers inseparable from it, and regarding the losses we have\r\nsustained for which indemnity has been so long withheld, and the injuries\r\nwe have suffered through that territory, and her means of redress, she was\r\nlikewise enabled to take with honor the course best calculated to do\r\njustice to the United States and to promote her own welfare.\r\n\r\nCopies of the instructions to the commanding general, of his correspondence\r\nwith the Secretary of War, explaining his motives and justifying his\r\nconduct, with a copy of the proceedings of the courts-martial in the trial\r\nof Arbuthnot and Ambristie, and of the correspondence between the Secretary\r\nof State and the minister plenipotentiary of Spain near this Government,\r\nand of the minister plenipotentiary of the United States at Madrid with the\r\nGovernment of Spain, will be laid before Congress.\r\n\r\nThe civil war which has so long prevailed between Spain and the Provinces\r\nin South America still continues, without any prospect of its speedy\r\ntermination. The information respecting the condition of those countries\r\nwhich has been collected by the commissioners recently returned from thence\r\nwill be laid before Congress in copies of their reports, with such other\r\ninformation as has been received from other agents of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt appears from these communications that the Government at Buenos Ayres\r\ndeclared itself independent in July, 1816, having previously exercised the\r\npower of an independent Government, though in the name of the King of\r\nSpain, from the year 1810; that the Banda Oriental, Entre Rios, and\r\nParaguay, with the city of Santa Fee, all of which are also independent,\r\nare unconnected with the present Government of Buenos Ayres; that Chili has\r\ndeclared itself independent and is closely connected with Buenos Ayres;\r\nthat Venezuela has also declared itself independent, and now maintains the\r\nconflict with various success; and that the remaining parts of South\r\nAmerica, except Monte Video and such other portions of the eastern bank of\r\nthe La Plata as are held by Portugal, are still in the possession of Spain\r\nor in a certain degree under her influence.\r\n\r\nBy a circular note addressed by the ministers of Spain to the allied\r\npowers, with whom they are respectively accredited, it appears that the\r\nallies have undertaken to mediate between Spain and the South American\r\nProvinces, and that the manner and extent of their interposition would be\r\nsettled by a congress which was to have met at Aix-la-Chapelle in September\r\nlast. From the general policy and course of proceeding observed by the\r\nallied powers in regard to this contest it is inferred that they will\r\nconfine their interposition to the expression of their sentiments,\r\nabstaining from the application of force. I state this impression that\r\nforce will not be applied with the greater satisfaction because it is a\r\ncourse more consistent with justice and likewise authorizes a hope that the\r\ncalamities of the war will be confined to the parties only, and will be of\r\nshorter duration.\r\n\r\nFrom the view taken of this subject, founded on all the information that we\r\nhave been able to obtain, there is good cause to be satisfied with the\r\ncourse heretofore pursued by the United States in regard to this contest,\r\nand to conclude that it is proper to adhere to it, especially in the\r\npresent state of affairs.\r\n\r\nI have great satisfaction in stating that our relations with France,\r\nRussia, and other powers continue on the most friendly basis.\r\n\r\nIn our domestic concerns we have ample cause of satisfaction. The receipts\r\ninto the Treasury during the three first quarters of the year have exceeded\r\n$17 millions.\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying all the demands which have been made under existing\r\nappropriations, including the final extinction of the old 6% stock and the\r\nredemption of a moiety of the Louisiana debt, it is estimated that there\r\nwill remain in the Treasury on the 1st day of January next more than $2\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained that the gross revenue which has accrued from the customs\r\nduring the same period amounts to $21 millions, and that the revenue of\r\nthe whole year may be estimated at not less than $26 millions. The sale\r\nof the public lands during the year has also greatly exceeded, both in\r\nquantity and price, that of any former year, and there is just reason to\r\nexpect a progressive improvement in that source of revenue.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that although the annual expenditure has been\r\nincreased by the act of the last session of Congress providing for\r\nRevolutionary pensions to an amount about equal to the proceeds of the\r\ninternal duties which were then repealed, the revenue for the ensuing year\r\nwill be proportionally augmented, and that whilst the public expenditure\r\nwill probably remain stationary, each successive year will add to the\r\nnational resources by the ordinary increase of our population and by the\r\ngradual development of our latent sources of national prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe strict execution of the revenue laws, resulting principally from the\r\nsalutary provisions of the act of the 20th of April last amending the\r\nseveral collection laws, has, it is presumed, secured to domestic\r\nmanufactures all the relief that can be derived from the duties which have\r\nbeen imposed upon foreign merchandise for their protection. Under the\r\ninfluence of this relief several branches of this important national\r\ninterest have assumed greater activity, and although it is hoped that\r\nothers will gradually revive and ultimately triumph over every obstacle,\r\nyet the expediency of granting further protection is submitted to your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe measures of defense authorized by existing laws have been pursued with\r\nthe zeal and activity due to so important an object, and with all the\r\ndispatch practicable in so extensive and great an undertaking. The survey\r\nof our maritime and inland frontiers has been continued, and at the points\r\nwhere it was decided to erect fortifications the work has been commenced,\r\nand in some instances considerable progress has been made. In compliance\r\nwith resolutions of the last session, the Board of Commissioners were\r\ndirected to examine in a particular manner the parts of the coast therein\r\ndesignated and to report their opinion of the most suitable sites for two\r\nnaval depots. This work is in a train of execution. The opinion of the\r\nBoard on this subject, with a plan of all the works necessary to a general\r\nsystem of defense so far as it has been formed, will be laid before\r\nCongress in a report from the proper department as soon as it can be\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the appropriations of the last session, treaties have\r\nbeen formed with the Quapaw tribe of Indians, inhabiting the country on the\r\nArkansaw, and the Great and Little Osages north of the White River; with\r\nthe tribes in the State of Indiana; with the several tribes within the\r\nState of Ohio and the Michigan Territory, and with the Chickasaws, by which\r\nvery extensive cessions of territory have been made to the United States.\r\nNegotiations are now depending with the tribes in the Illinois Territory\r\nand with the Choctaws, by which it is expected that other extensive\r\ncessions will be made. I take great interest in stating that the cessions\r\nalready made, which are considered so important to the United States, have\r\nbeen obtained on conditions very satisfactory to the Indians.\r\n\r\nWith a view to the security of our inland frontiers, it has been thought\r\nexpedient to establish strong posts at the mouth of Yellow Stone River and\r\nat the Mandan village on the Missouri, and at the mouth of St. Peters on\r\nthe Mississippi, at no great distance from our northern boundaries. It can\r\nhardly be presumed while such posts are maintained in the rear of the\r\nIndian tribes that they will venture to attack our peaceable inhabitants. A\r\nstrong hope is entertained that this measure will likewise be productive of\r\nmuch good to the tribes themselves, especially in promoting the great\r\nobject of their civilization.\r\n\r\nExperience has clearly demonstrated that independent savage communities can\r\nnot long exist within the limits of a civilized population. The progress of\r\nthe latter has almost invariably terminated in the extinction of the\r\nformer, especially of the tribes belonging to our portion of this\r\nhemisphere, among whom loftiness of sentiment and gallantry in action have\r\nbeen conspicuous. To civilize them, and even to prevent their extinction,\r\nit seems to be indispensable that their independence as communities should\r\ncease, and that the control of the United States over them should be\r\ncomplete and undisputed. The hunter state will then be more easily\r\nabandoned, and recourse will be had to the acquisition and culture of land\r\nand to other pursuits tending to dissolve the ties which connect them\r\ntogether as a savage community and to give a new character to every\r\nindividual. I present this subject to the consideration of Congress on the\r\npresumption that it may be found expedient and practicable to adopt some\r\nbenevolent provisions, having these objects in view, relative to the tribes\r\nwithin our settlements.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary during the present year to maintain a strong naval\r\nforce in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico, and to send some\r\npublic ships along the southern coast and to the Pacific Ocean. By these\r\nmeans amicable relations with the Barbary Powers have been preserved, our\r\ncommerce has been protected, and our rights respected. The augmentation of\r\nour Navy is advancing with a steady progress toward the limit contemplated\r\nby law.\r\n\r\nI communicate with great satisfaction the accession of another State\r\n(Illinois) to our Union, because I perceive from the proof afforded by the\r\nadditions already made the regular progress and sure consummation of a\r\npolicy of which history affords no example, and of which the good effect\r\ncan not be too highly estimated. By extending our Government on the\r\nprinciples of our Constitution over the vast territory within our limits,\r\non the Lakes and the Mississippi and its numerous streams, new life and\r\nvigor are infused into every part of our system. By increasing the number\r\nof the States the confidence of the State governments in their own security\r\nis increased and their jealousy of the National Government proportionally\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nThe impracticability of one consolidated Government for this great and\r\ngrowing nation will be more apparent and will be universally admitted.\r\nIncapable of exercising local authority except for general purposes, the\r\nGeneral Government will no longer be dreaded. In those cases of a local\r\nnature and for all the great purposes for which it was instituted its\r\nauthority will be cherished. Each Government will acquire new force and a\r\ngreater freedom of action within its proper sphere.\r\n\r\nOther inestimable advantages will follow. Our produce will be augmented to\r\nan incalculable amount in articles of the greatest value for domestic use\r\nand foreign commerce. Our navigation will in like degree be increased, and\r\nas the shipping of the Atlantic States will be employed in the\r\ntransportation of the vast produce of the Western country, even those parts\r\nof the United States which are most remote from each other will be further\r\nbound together by the strongest ties which mutual interest can create.\r\n\r\nThe situation of this District, it is thought, requires the attention of\r\nCongress. By the Constitution the power of legislation is exclusively\r\nvested in the Congress of the United States. In the exercise of this power,\r\nin which the people have no participation, Congress legislate in all cases\r\ndirectly on the local concerns of the District. As this is a departure, for\r\na special purpose, from the general principles of our system, it may merit\r\nconsideration whether an arrangement better adapted to the principles of\r\nour Government and to the particular interests of the people may not be\r\ndevised which will neither infringe the Constitution nor affect the object\r\nwhich the provision in question was intended to secure. The growing\r\npopulation, already considerable, and the increasing business of the\r\nDistrict, which it is believed already interferes with the deliberations of\r\nCongress on great national concerns, furnish additional motives for\r\nrecommending this subject to your consideration.\r\n\r\nWhen we view the great blessings with which our country has been favored,\r\nthose which we now enjoy, and the means which we possess of handing them\r\ndown unimpaired to our latest posterity, our attention is irresistibly\r\ndrawn to the source from whence they flow. Let us, then, unite in offering\r\nour most grateful acknowledgments for these blessings to the Divine Author\r\nof All Good.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Monroe\r\nDecember 7, 1819\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe public buildings being advanced to a stage to afford accommodation for\r\nCongress, I offer you my sincere congratulations on the recommencement of\r\nyour duties in the Capitol.\r\n\r\nIn bringing you to view the incidents most deserving attention which have\r\noccurred since your last session, I regret to have to state that several of\r\nour principal cities have suffered by sickness, that an unusual drought has\r\nprevailed in the Middle and Western States, and that a derangement has been\r\nfelt in some of our moneyed institutions which has proportionably affected\r\ntheir credit. I am happy, however, to have it in my power to assure you\r\nthat the health of our cities is now completely restored; that the produce\r\nof the year, though less abundant than usual, will not only be amply\r\nsufficient for home consumption, but afford a large surplus for the supply\r\nof the wants of other nations, and that the derangement in the circulating\r\npaper medium, by being left to those remedies which its obvious causes\r\nsuggested and the good sense and virtue of our fellow citizens supplied,\r\nhas diminished.\r\n\r\nHaving informed Congress, on the 27th of February last, that a treaty of\r\namity, settlement, and limits had been concluded in this city between the\r\nUnited States and Spain, and ratified by the competent authorities of the\r\nformer, full confidence was entertained that it would have been ratified by\r\nHis Catholic Majesty with equal promptitude and a like earnest desire to\r\nterminate on the conditions of that treaty the differences which had so\r\nlong existed between the two countries. Every view which the subject\r\nadmitted of was thought to have justified this conclusion.\r\n\r\nGreat losses had been sustained by citizens of the United States from\r\nSpanish cruisers more than 20 years before, which had not been redressed.\r\nThese losses had been acknowledged and provided for by a treaty as far back\r\nas the year 1802, which, although concluded at Madrid, was not then\r\nratified by the Government of Spain, nor since, until the last year, when\r\nit was suspended by the late treaty, a more satisfactory provision to both\r\nparties, as was presumed, having been made for them. Other differences had\r\narisen in this long interval, affecting their highest interests, which were\r\nlikewise provided for by this last treaty.\r\n\r\nThe treaty itself was formed on great consideration and a thorough\r\nknowledge of all circumstances, the subject matter of every article having\r\nbeen for years under discussion and repeated references having been made by\r\nthe minister of Spain to his Government on the points respecting which the\r\ngreatest difference of opinion prevailed. It was formed by a minister duly\r\nauthorized for the purpose, who had represented his Government in the\r\nUnited States and been employed in this long-protracted negotiation\r\nseveral years, and who, it is not denied, kept strictly within the letter\r\nof his instructions. The faith of Spain was therefore pledged, under\r\ncircumstances of peculiar force and solemnity, for its ratification.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the United States this treaty was evidently acceded to in a\r\nspirit of conciliation and concession. The indemnity for injuries and\r\nlosses so long before sustained, and now again acknowledged and provided\r\nfor, was to be paid by them without becoming a charge on the treasury of\r\nSpain. For territory ceded by Spain other territory of great value, to\r\nwhich our claim was believed to be well founded, was ceded by the United\r\nStates, and in a quarter more interesting to her. This cession was\r\nnevertheless received as the means of indemnifying our citizens in a\r\nconsiderable sum, the presumed amount of their losses.\r\n\r\nOther considerations of great weight urged the cession of this territory by\r\nSpain. It was surrounded by the Territories of the United States on every\r\nside except on that of the ocean. Spain had lost her authority over it,\r\nand, falling into the hands of adventurers connected with the savages, it\r\nwas made the means of unceasing annoyance and injury to our Union in many\r\nof its most essential interests. By this cession, then, Spain ceded a\r\nterritory in reality of no value to her and obtained concessions of the\r\nhighest importance by the settlement of long-standing differences with the\r\nUnited States affecting their respective claims and limits, and likewise\r\nrelieved herself from the obligation of a treaty relating to it which she\r\nhad failed to fulfill, and also from the responsibility incident to the\r\nmost flagrant and pernicious abuses of her rights where she could not\r\nsupport her authority.\r\n\r\nIt being known that the treaty was formed under these circumstances, not a\r\ndoubt was entertained that His Catholic Majesty would have ratified it\r\nwithout delay. I regret to have to state that this reasonable expectation\r\nhas been disappointed; that the treaty was not ratified within the time\r\nstipulated and has not since been ratified. As it is important that the\r\nnature and character of this unexpected occurrence should be distinctly\r\nunderstood, I think it my duty to communicate to you all the facts and\r\ncircumstances in my possession relating to it.\r\n\r\nAnxious to prevent all future disagreement with Spain by giving the most\r\nprompt effect to the treaty which had been thus concluded, and particularly\r\nby the establishment of a Government in Florida which should preserve order\r\nthere, the minister of the United States who had been recently appointed to\r\nHis Catholic Majesty, and to whom the ratification by his Government had\r\nbeen committed to be exchanged for that of Spain, was instructed to\r\ntransmit the latter to the Department of State as soon as obtained, by a\r\npublic ship subjected to his order for the purpose.\r\n\r\nUnexpected delay occurring in the ratification by Spain, he requested to be\r\ninformed of the cause. It was stated in reply that the great importance of\r\nthe subject, and a desire to obtain explanations on certain points which\r\nwere not specified, had produced the delay, and that an envoy would be\r\ndispatched to the United States to obtain such explanations of this\r\nGovernment. The minister of the United States offered to give full\r\nexplanation on any point on which it might be desired, which proposal was\r\ndeclined. Having communicated this result to the Department of State in\r\nAugust last, he was instructed, notwithstanding the disappointment and\r\nsurprise which it produced, to inform the Government of Spain that if the\r\ntreaty should be ratified and transmitted here at any time before the\r\nmeeting of Congress it would be received and have the same effect as if it\r\nhad been ratified in due time.\r\n\r\nThis order was executed, the authorized communication was made to the\r\nGovernment of Spain, and by its answer, which has just been received, we\r\nare officially made acquainted for the first time with the causes which\r\nhave prevented the ratification of the treaty by His Catholic Majesty. It\r\nis alleged by the minister of Spain that his Government had attempted to\r\nalter one of the principal articles of the treaty by a declaration which\r\nthe minister of the United States had been ordered to present when he\r\nshould deliver the ratification by his Government in exchange for that of\r\nSpain, and of which he gave notice, explanatory of the sense in which that\r\narticle was understood. It is further alleged that this Government had\r\nrecently tolerated or protected an expedition from the United States\r\nagainst the Province of Texas. These two imputed acts are stated as the\r\nreasons which have induced His Catholic Majesty to withhold his\r\nratification from the treaty, to obtain explanations respecting which it is\r\nrepeated that an envoy would be forthwith dispatched to the United States.\r\nHow far these allegations will justify the conduct of the Government of\r\nSpain will appear on a view of the following facts and the evidence which\r\nsupports them:\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the documents transmitted herewith that the declaration\r\nmentioned relates to a clause in the 8th article concerning certain grants\r\nof land recently made by His Catholic Majesty in Florida, which it was\r\nunderstood had conveyed all the lands which until then had been ungranted;\r\nit was the intention of the parties to annul these latter grants, and that\r\nclause was drawn for that express purpose and for none other. The date of\r\nthese grants was unknown, but it was understood to be posterior to that\r\ninserted in the article; indeed, it must be obvious to all that if that\r\nprovision in the treaty had not the effect of annulling these grants, it\r\nwould be altogether nugatory. Immediately after the treaty was concluded\r\nand ratified by this Government an intimation was received that these\r\ngrants were of anterior date to that fixed on by the treaty and that they\r\nwould not, of course, be affected by it. The mere possibility of such a\r\ncase, so inconsistent with the intention of the parties and the meaning of\r\nthe article, induced this Government to demand an explanation on the\r\nsubject, which was immediately granted, and which corresponds with this\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the other act alleged, that this Government had tolerated\r\nor protected an expedition against Texas, it is utterly without\r\nfoundation. Every discountenance has invariably been given to any such\r\nattempt within the limits of the United States, as is fully evinced by the\r\nacts of the Government and the proceedings of the courts. There being\r\ncause, however, to apprehend, in the course of the last summer, that some\r\nadventurers entertained views of the kind suggested, the attention of the\r\nconstituted authorities in that quarter was immediately drawn to them,\r\nand it is known that the project, whatever it might be, has utterly\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nThese facts will, it is presumed, satisfy every impartial mind that the\r\nGovernment of Spain had no justifiable cause for declining to ratify the\r\ntreaty. A treaty concluded in conformity with instructions is obligatory,\r\nin good faith, in all its stipulations, according to the true intent and\r\nmeaning of the parties. Each party is bound to ratify it. If either could\r\nset it aside without the consent of the other, there would be no longer any\r\nrules applicable to such transactions between nations.\r\n\r\nBy this proceeding the Government of Spain has rendered to the United\r\nStates a new and very serious injury. It has been stated that a minister\r\nwould be sent to ask certain explanations of this Government; but if such\r\nwere desired, why were they not asked within the time limited for the\r\nratification?\r\n\r\nIs it contemplated to open a new negotiation respecting any of the articles\r\nor conditions of the treaty? If that were done, to what consequences might\r\nit not lead? At what time and in what manner would a new negotiation\r\nterminate? By this proceeding Spain has formed a relation between the two\r\ncountries which will justify any measures on the part of the United States\r\nwhich a strong sense of injury and a proper regard for the rights and\r\ninterests of the nation may dictate.\r\n\r\nIn the course to be pursued these objects should be constantly held in view\r\nand have their due weight. Our national honor must be maintained, and a new\r\nand a distinguished proof be afforded of that regard for justice and\r\nmoderation which has invariably governed the councils of this free people.\r\nIt must be obvious to all that if the United States had been desirous of\r\nmaking conquests, or had been even willing to aggrandize themselves in that\r\nway, they could have had no inducement to form this treaty. They would have\r\nmuch cause for gratulation at the course which has been pursued by Spain.\r\nAn ample field for ambition is open before them, but such a career is not\r\nconsistent with the principles of their Government nor the interests of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nFrom a full view of all circumstances, it is submitted to the consideration\r\nof Congress whether it will not be proper for the United States to carry\r\nthe conditions of the treaty into effect in the same manner as if it had\r\nbeen ratified by Spain, claiming on their part all its advantages and\r\nyielding to Spain those secured to her. By pursuing this course we shall\r\nrest on the sacred ground of right, sanctioned in the most solemn manner by\r\nSpain herself by a treaty which she was bound to ratify, for refusing to do\r\nwhich she must incur the censure of other nations, even those most friendly\r\nto her, while by confining ourselves within that limit we can not fail to\r\nobtain their well-merited approbation.\r\n\r\nWe must have peace on a frontier where we have been so long disturbed; our\r\ncitizens must be indemnified for losses so long since sustained, and for\r\nwhich indemnity has been so unjustly withheld from them. Accomplishing\r\nthese great objects, we obtain all that is desirable.\r\n\r\nBut His Catholic Majesty has twice declared his determination to send a\r\nminister to the United States to ask explanations on certain points and to\r\ngive them respecting his delay to ratify the treaty. Shall we act by taking\r\nthe ceded territory and proceeding to execute the other conditions of the\r\ntreaty before this minister arrives and is heard?\r\n\r\nThis is a case which forms a strong appeal to the candor, the magnanimity,\r\nand the honor of this people. Much is due to courtesy between nations. By a\r\nshort delay we shall lose nothing, for, resting on the ground of immutable\r\ntruth and justice, we can not be diverted from our purpose.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be presumed that the explanations which may be given to the\r\nminister of Spain will be satisfactory, and produce the desired result. In\r\nany event, the delay for the purpose mentioned, being a further\r\nmanifestation of the sincere desire to terminate in the most friendly\r\nmanner all differences with Spain, can not fail to be duly appreciated by\r\nHis Catholic Majesty as well as by other powers. It is submitted,\r\ntherefore, whether it will not be proper to make the law proposed for\r\ncarrying the conditions of the treaty into effect, should it be adopted,\r\ncontingent; to suspend its operation, upon the responsibility of the\r\nExecutive, in such manner as to afford an opportunity for such friendly\r\nexplanations as may be desired during the present session of Congress.\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress a copy of the treaty and of the instructions to\r\nthe minister of the United States at Madrid respecting it; of his\r\ncorrespondence with the minister of Spain, and of such other documents as\r\nmay be necessary to give a full view of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the course which the Spanish Government have on this occasion thought\r\nproper to pursue it is satisfactory to know that they have not been\r\ncountenanced by any other European power. On the contrary, the opinion and\r\nwishes both of France and Great Britain have not been withheld either from\r\nthe United States or from Spain, and have been unequivocal in favor of the\r\nratification. There is also reason to believe that the sentiments of the\r\nImperial Government of Russia have been the same, and that they have also\r\nbeen made known to the cabinet of Madrid.\r\n\r\nIn the civil war existing between Spain and the Spanish Provinces in this\r\nhemisphere the greatest care has been taken to enforce the laws intended to\r\npreserve an impartial neutrality. Our ports have continued to be equally\r\nopen to both parties and on the same conditions, and our citizens have been\r\nequally restrained from interfering in favor of either to the prejudice of\r\nthe other. The progress of the war, however has operated manifestly in\r\nfavor of the colonies. Buenos Ayres still maintains unshaken the\r\nindependence which it declared in 1816, and has enjoyed since 1810. Like\r\nsuccess has also lately attended Chili and the Provinces north of the La\r\nPlata bordering on it, and likewise Venezuela.\r\n\r\nThis contest has from its commencement been very interesting to other\r\npowers, and to none more so than to the United States. A virtuous people\r\nmay and will confine themselves within the limit of a strict neutrality;\r\nbut it is not in their power to behold a conflict so vitally important to\r\ntheir neighbors without the sensibility and sympathy which naturally belong\r\nto such a case. It has been the steady purpose of this Government to\r\nprevent that feeling leading to excess, and it is very gratifying to have\r\nit in my power to state that so strong has been the sense throughout the\r\nwhole community of what was due to the character and obligations of the\r\nnation that very few examples of a contrary kind have occurred.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the colonies from the parent country and the great extent\r\nof their population and resources gave them advantages which it was\r\nanticipated at a very early period would be difficult for Spain to\r\nsurmount. The steadiness, consistency, and success with which they have\r\npursued their object, as evinced more particularly by the undisturbed\r\nsovereignty which Buenos Ayres has so long enjoyed, evidently give them a\r\nstrong claim to the favorable consideration of other nations. These\r\nsentiments on the part of the United States have not been withheld from\r\nother powers, with whom it is desirable to act in concert. Should it become\r\nmanifest to the world that the efforts of Spain to subdue these Provinces\r\nwill be fruitless, it may be presumed that the Spanish Government itself\r\nwill give up the contest. In producing such a determination it can not be\r\ndoubted that the opinion of friendly powers who have taken no part in the\r\ncontroversy will have their merited influence.\r\n\r\nIt is of the highest importance to our national character and indispensable\r\nto the morality of our citizens that all violations of our neutrality\r\nshould be prevented. No door should be left open for the evasion of our\r\nlaws, no opportunity afforded to any who may be disposed to take advantage\r\nof it to compromit the interest or the honor of the nation. It is\r\nsubmitted, therefore, to the consideration of Congress whether it may not\r\nbe advisable to revise the laws with a view to this desirable result.\r\n\r\nIt is submitted also whether it may not be proper to designate by law the\r\nseveral ports or places along the coast at which only foreign ships of war\r\nand privateers may be admitted. The difficulty of sustaining the\r\nregulations of our commerce and of other important interests from abuse\r\nwithout such designation furnishes a strong motive for this measure.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the negotiation for the renewal of the commercial convention\r\nbetween the United States and Great Britain a hope had been entertained\r\nthat an article might have been agreed upon mutually satisfactory to both\r\ncountries, regulating upon principles of justice and reciprocity the\r\ncommercial intercourse between the United States and the British\r\npossessions as well in the West Indies as upon the continent of North\r\nAmerica. The plenipotentiaries of the two Governments not having been able\r\nto come to an agreement on this important interest, those of the United\r\nStates reserved for the consideration of this Government the proposals\r\nwhich had been presented to them as the ultimate offer on the part of the\r\nBritish Government, and which they were not authorized to accept. On their\r\ntransmission here they were examined with due deliberation, the result of\r\nwhich was a new effort to meet the views of the British Government. The\r\nminister of the United States was instructed to make a further proposal,\r\nwhich has not been accepted. It was, however, declined in an amicable\r\nmanner. I recommend to the consideration of Congress whether further\r\nprohibitory provisions in the laws relating to this intercourse may not be\r\nexpedient. It is seen with interest that although it has not been\r\npracticable as yet to agree in any arrangement of this important branch of\r\ntheir commerce, such is the disposition of the parties that each will view\r\nany regulations which the other may make respecting it in the most friendly\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nBy the 5th article of the convention concluded on October 20th, 1818, it\r\nwas stipulated that the differences which have arisen between the two\r\nGovernments with respect to the true intent and meaning of the 5th article\r\nof the treaty of Ghent, in relation to the carrying away by British\r\nofficers of slaves from the United States after the exchange of the\r\nratifications of the treaty of peace, should be referred to the decision of\r\nsome friendly sovereign or state to be named for that purpose. The minister\r\nof the United States has been instructed to name to the British Government\r\na foreign sovereign, the common friend to both parties, for the decision of\r\nthis question. The answer of that Government to the proposal when received\r\nwill indicate the further measures to be pursued on the part of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAlthough the pecuniary embarrassments which affected various parts of the\r\nUnion during the latter part of the preceding year have during the present\r\nbeen considerably augmented, and still continue to exist, the receipts into\r\nthe Treasury to the 30th of September last have amounted to $19 millions.\r\nAfter defraying the current expenses of the Government, including the\r\nInterest and reimbursement of the public debt payable to that period,\r\namounting to $18.2 millions, there remained in the Treasury on that day\r\nmore than $2.5 millions, which, with the sums receivable during the\r\nremainder of the year, will exceed the current demands upon the Treasury\r\nfor the same period.\r\n\r\nThe causes which have tended to diminish the public receipts could not fail\r\nto have a corresponding effect upon the revenue which has accrued upon\r\nimposts and tonnage during the three first quarters of the present year. It\r\nis, however, ascertained that the duties which have been secured during\r\nthat period exceed $18 millions, and those of the whole year will probably\r\namount to $23 millions.\r\n\r\nFor the probable receipts of the next year I refer you to the statements\r\nwhich will be transmitted from the Treasury, which will enable you to judge\r\nwhether further provision be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe great reduction in the price of the principal articles of domestic\r\ngrowth which has occurred during the present year, and the consequent fall\r\nin the price of labor, apparently so favorable to the success of domestic\r\nmanufactures, have not shielded them against other causes adverse to their\r\nprosperity. The pecuniary embarrassments which have so deeply affected the\r\ncommercial interests of the nation have been no less adverse to our\r\nmanufacturing establishments in several sections of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe great reduction of the currency which the banks have been constrained\r\nto make in order to continue specie payments, and the vitiated character of\r\nit where such reductions have not been attempted, instead of placing within\r\nthe reach of these establishments the pecuniary aid necessary to avail\r\nthemselves of the advantages resulting from the reduction in the prices of\r\nthe raw materials and of labor, have compelled the banks to withdraw from\r\nthem a portion of the capital heretofore advanced to them. That aid which\r\nhas been refused by the banks has not been obtained from other sources,\r\nowing to the loss of individual confidence from the frequent failures which\r\nhave recently occurred in some of our principal commercial cities.\r\n\r\nAn additional cause for the depression of these establishments may probably\r\nbe found in the pecuniary embarrassments which have recently affected those\r\ncountries with which our commerce has been principally prosecuted. Their\r\nmanufactures, for the want of a ready or profitable market at home, have\r\nbeen shipped by the manufacturers to the United States, and in many\r\ninstances sold at a price below their current value at the place of\r\nmanufacture. Although this practice may from its nature be considered\r\ntemporary or contingent, it is not on that account less injurious in its\r\neffects. Uniformity in the demand and price of an article is highly\r\ndesirable to the domestic manufacturer.\r\n\r\nIt is deemed of great importance to give encouragement to our domestic\r\nmanufacturers. In what manner the evils which have been adverted to may be\r\nremedied, and how far it may be practicable in other respects to afford to\r\nthem further encouragement, paying due regard to the other great interests\r\nof the nation, is submitted to the wisdom of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe survey of the coast for the establishment of fortifications is now\r\nnearly completed, and considerable progress has been made in the collection\r\nof materials for the construction of fortifications in the Gulf of Mexico\r\nand in the Chesapeake Bay. The works on the eastern bank of the Potomac\r\nbelow Alexandria and on the Pea Patch, in the Delaware, are much advanced,\r\nand it is expected that the fortifications at the Narrows, in the harbor of\r\nNew York, will be completed the present year. To derive all the advantages\r\ncontemplated from these fortifications it was necessary that they should be\r\njudiciously posted, and constructed with a view to permanence. The progress\r\nhitherto has therefore been slow; but as the difficulties in parts\r\nheretofore the least explored and known are surmounted, it will in future\r\nbe more rapid. As soon as the survey of the coast is completed, which it is\r\nexpected will be done early in the next spring, the engineers employed in\r\nit will proceed to examine for like purposes the northern and northwestern\r\nfrontiers.\r\n\r\nThe troops intended to occupy a station at the mouth of the St. Peters, on\r\nthe Mississippi, have established themselves there, and those who were\r\nordered to the mouth of the Yellow Stone, on the Missouri, have ascended\r\nthat river to the Council Bluff, where they will remain until the next\r\nspring, when they will proceed to the place of their destination. I have\r\nthe satisfaction to state that this measure has been executed in amity with\r\nthe Indian tribes, and that it promises to produce, in regard to them, all\r\nthe advantages which were contemplated by it.\r\n\r\nMuch progress has likewise been made in the construction of ships of war\r\nand in the collection of timber and other materials for ship building. It\r\nis not doubted that our Navy will soon be augmented to the number and\r\nplaced in all respects on the footing provided for by law.\r\n\r\nThe Board, consisting of engineers and naval officers, have not yet made\r\ntheir final report of sites for two naval depots, as instructed according\r\nto the resolutions of March 18th, 1818 and April 20th, 1818, but they\r\nhave examined the coast therein designated, and their report is expected\r\nin the next month.\r\n\r\nFor the protection of our commerce in the Mediterranean, along the southern\r\nAtlantic coast, in the Pacific and Indian oceans, it has been found\r\nnecessary to maintain a strong naval force, which it seems proper for the\r\npresent to continue. There is much reason to believe that if any portion of\r\nthe squadron heretofore stationed in the Mediterranean should be withdrawn\r\nour intercourse with the powers bordering on that sea would be much\r\ninterrupted, if not altogether destroyed. Such, too, has been the growth of\r\na spirit of piracy in the other quarters mentioned, by adventurers from\r\nevery country, in abuse of the friendly flags which they have assumed, that\r\nnot to protect our commerce there would be to abandon it as a prey to\r\ntheir rapacity.\r\n\r\nDue attention has likewise been paid to the suppression of the slave trade,\r\nin compliance with a law of the last session. Orders have been given to the\r\ncommanders of all our public ships to seize all vessels navigated under our\r\nflag engaged in that trade, and to bring them in to be proceeded against in\r\nthe manner prescribed by the law. It is hoped that these vigorous measures,\r\nsupported by like acts by other nations, will soon terminate a commerce so\r\ndisgraceful to the civilized world.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of the duty imposed by these acts, and of a high trust\r\nconnected with it, it is with deep regret I have to state the loss which\r\nhas been sustained by the death of Commodore Perry. His gallantry in a\r\nbrilliant exploit in the late war added to the renown of his country. His\r\ndeath is deplored as a national misfortune.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Monroe\r\nNovember 14, 1820\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn communicating to you a just view of public affairs at the commencement\r\nof your present labors, I do it with great satisfaction, because, taking\r\nall circumstances into consideration which claim attention, I see much\r\ncause to rejoice in the felicity of our situation. In making this remark I\r\ndo not wish to be understood to imply that an unvaried prosperity is to be\r\nseen in every interest of this great community. In the progress of a nation\r\ninhabiting a territory of such vast extent and great variety of climate,\r\nevery portion of which is engaged in foreign commerce and liable to be\r\naffected in some degree by the changes which occur in the condition and\r\nregulations of foreign countries, it would be strange if the produce of our\r\nsoil and the industry and enterprise of our fellow citizens received at all\r\ntimes and in every quarter an uniform and equal encouragement. This would\r\nbe more than we would have a right to expect under circumstances the most\r\nfavorable.\r\n\r\nPressures on certain interests, it is admitted, have been felt; but\r\nallowing to these their greatest extent, they detract but little from the\r\nforce of the remarks already made. In forming a just estimate of our\r\npresent situation it is proper to look at the whole in the outline as well\r\nas in the detail. A free, virtuous, and enlightened people know well the\r\ngreat principles and causes on which their happiness depends, and even\r\nthose who suffer most occasionally in their transitory concerns find great\r\nrelief under their sufferings from the blessings which they otherwise enjoy\r\nand in the consoling and animating hope which they administer.\r\n\r\nFrom whence do these pressures come? Not from a Government which is founded\r\nby, administered for, and supported by the people. We trace them to the\r\npeculiar character of the epoch in which we live, and to the extraordinary\r\noccurrences which have signalized it. The convulsions with which several of\r\nthe powers of Europe have been shaken and the long and destructive wars in\r\nwhich all were engaged, with their sudden transition to a state of peace,\r\npresenting in the first instance unusual encouragement to our commerce and\r\nwithdrawing it in the second even within its wonted limit, could not fail\r\nto be sensibly felt here. The station, too, which we had to support through\r\nthis long conflict, compelled as we were finally to become a party to it\r\nwith a principal power, and to make great exertions, suffer heavy losses,\r\nand to contract considerable debts, disturbing the ordinary course of\r\naffairs by augmenting to a vast amount the circulating medium, and thereby\r\nelevating at one time the price of every article above a just standard and\r\ndepressing it at another below it, had likewise its due effect.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that the pressures of which we complain have proceeded in a\r\ngreat measure from these causes. When, then, we take into view the\r\nprosperous and happy condition of our country in all the great\r\ncircumstances which constitute the felicity of a nation--every individual\r\nin the full enjoyment of all his rights, the Union blessed with plenty and\r\nrapidly rising to greatness under a National Government which operates with\r\ncomplete effect in every part without being felt in any except by the ample\r\nprotection which it affords, and under State governments which perform\r\ntheir equal share, according to a wise distribution of power between them,\r\nin promoting the public happiness--it is impossible to behold so\r\ngratifying, so glorious a spectacle without being penetrated with the most\r\nprofound and grateful acknowledgments to the Supreme Author of All Good for\r\nsuch manifold and inestimable blessings.\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with these sentiments, I can not regard the pressures to\r\nwhich I have adverted otherwise than in the light of mild and instructive\r\nadmonitions, warning us of dangers to be shunned in future, teaching us\r\nlessons of economy corresponding with the simplicity and purity of our\r\ninstitutions and best adapted to their support, evincing the connection and\r\ndependence which the various parts of our happy Union have on each other,\r\nthereby augmenting daily our social incorporation and adding by its strong\r\nties new strength and vigor to the political; opening a wider range, and\r\nwith new encouragement, to the industry and enterprise of our fellow\r\ncitizens at home and abroad, and more especially by the multiplied proofs\r\nwhich it has accumulated of the great perfection of our most excellent\r\nsystem of Government, the powerful instrument in the hands of our\r\nAll-merciful Creator in securing to us these blessings.\r\n\r\nHappy as our situation is, it does not exempt us from solicitude and care\r\nfor the future. On the contrary, as the blessings which we enjoy are great,\r\nproportionably great should be our vigilance, zeal, and activity to\r\npreserve them. Foreign wars may again expose us to new wrongs, which would\r\nimpose on us new duties for which we ought to be prepared. The state of\r\nEurope is unsettled, and how long peace may be preserved is altogether\r\nuncertain; in addition to which we have interests of our own to adjust\r\nwhich will require particular attention. A correct view of our relations\r\nwith each power will enable you to form a just idea of existing\r\ndifficulties, and of the measures of precaution best adapted to them.\r\n\r\nRespecting our relations with Spain nothing explicit can now be\r\ncommunicated. On the adjournment of Congress in May last the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States at Madrid was instructed to inform the\r\nGovernment of Spain that if His Catholic Majesty should then ratify the\r\ntreaty this Government would accept the ratification so far as to submit to\r\nthe decision of the Senate the question whether such ratification should be\r\nreceived in exchange for that of the United States heretofore given.\r\n\r\nBy letters from the minister of the United States to the Secretary of State\r\nit appears that a communication in conformity with his instructions had\r\nbeen made to the Government of Spain, and that the Cortes had the subject\r\nunder consideration. The result of the deliberations of that body, which is\r\ndaily expected, will be made known to Congress as soon as it is received.\r\nThe friendly sentiment which was expressed on the part of the United States\r\nin the message of the 9th of May last is still entertained for Spain.\r\n\r\nAmong the causes of regret, however, which are inseparable from the delay\r\nattending this transaction it is proper to state that satisfactory\r\ninformation has been received that measures have been recently adopted by\r\ndesigning persons to convert certain parts of the Province of East Florida\r\ninto depots for the reception of foreign goods, from whence to smuggle them\r\ninto the United States. By opening a port within the limits of Florida,\r\nimmediately on our boundary where there was no settlement, the object could\r\nnot be misunderstood. An early accommodation of differences will, it is\r\nhoped, prevent all such fraudulent and pernicious practices, and place the\r\nrelations of the two countries on a very amicable and permanent basis.\r\n\r\nThe commercial relations between the United States and the British colonies\r\nin the West Indies and on this continent have undergone no change, the\r\nBritish Government still preferring to leave that commerce under the\r\nrestriction heretofore imposed on it on each side. It is satisfactory to\r\nrecollect that the restraints resorted to by the United States were\r\ndefensive only, intended to prevent a monopoly under British regulations in\r\nfavor of Great Britain, as it likewise is to know that the experiment is\r\nadvancing in a spirit of amity between the parties.\r\n\r\nThe question depending between the United States and Great Britain\r\nrespecting the construction of the first article of the treaty of Ghent has\r\nbeen referred by both Governments to the decision of the Emperor of Russia,\r\nwho has accepted the umpirage.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made with the Government of France to regulate by\r\ntreaty the commerce between the two countries on the principle of\r\nreciprocity and equality. By the last communication from the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States at Paris, to whom full power had been\r\ngiven, we learn that the negotiation has been commenced there; but serious\r\ndifficulties having occurred, the French Government had resolved to\r\ntransfer it to the United States, for which purpose the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of France had been ordered to repair to this city, and\r\nwhose arrival might soon be expected. It is hoped that this important\r\ninterest may be arranged on just conditions and in a manner equally\r\nsatisfactory to both parties. It is submitted to Congress to decide, until\r\nsuch arrangement is made, how far it may be proper, on the principle of the\r\nact of the last session which augmented the tonnage duty on French vessels,\r\nto adopt other measures for carrying more completely into effect the policy\r\nof that act.\r\n\r\nThe act referred to, which imposed new tonnage on French vessels, having\r\nbeen in force from and after the first day of July, it has happened that\r\nseveral vessels of that nation which had been dispatched from France before\r\nits existence was known have entered the ports of the United States, and\r\nbeen subject to its operation, without that previous notice which the\r\ngeneral spirit of our laws gives to individuals in similar cases. The\r\nobject of that law having been merely to countervail the inequalities which\r\nexisted to the disadvantage of the United States in their commercial\r\nintercourse with France, it is submitted also to the consideration of\r\nCongress whether, in the spirit of amity and conciliation which it is no\r\nless the inclination than the policy of the United States to preserve in\r\ntheir intercourse with other powers, it may not be proper to extend relief\r\nto the individuals interested in those cases by exempting from the\r\noperation of the law all those vessels which have entered our ports without\r\nhaving had the means of previously knowing the existence of the additional\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nThe contest between Spain and the colonies, according to the most authentic\r\ninformation, is maintained by the latter with improved success. The\r\nunfortunate divisions which were known to exist some time since at Buenos\r\nAyres it is understood still prevail. In no part of South America has Spain\r\nmade any impression on the colonies, while in many parts, and particularly\r\nin Venezuela and New Grenada, the colonies have gained strength and\r\nacquired reputation, both for the management of the war in which they have\r\nbeen successful and for the order of the internal administration.\r\n\r\nThe late change in the Government of Spain, by the reestablishment of the\r\nconstitution of 1812, is an event which promises to be favorable to the\r\nrevolution. Under the authority of the Cortes the Congress of Angostura was\r\ninvited to open a negotiation for the settlement of differences between the\r\nparties, to which it was replied that they would willingly open the\r\nnegotiation provided the acknowledgment of their independence was made its\r\nbasis, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\nNo facts are known to this Government to warrant the belief that any of the\r\npowers of Europe will take part in the contest, whence it may be inferred,\r\nconsidering all circumstances which must have weight in producing the\r\nresult, that an adjustment will finally take place on the basis proposed by\r\nthe colonies. To promote that result by friendly counsels with other\r\npowers, including Spain herself, has been the uniform policy of this\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn looking to the internal concerns of our country you will, I am\r\npersuaded, derive much satisfaction from a view of the several objects to\r\nwhich, in the discharge of your official duties, your attention will be\r\ndrawn. Among these none holds a more important place than the public\r\nrevenue, from the direct operation of the power by which it is raised on\r\nthe people, and by its influence in giving effect to every other power of\r\nthe Government. The revenue depends on the resources of the country, and\r\nthe facility by which the amount required is raised is a strong proof of\r\nthe extent of the resources and of the efficiency of the Government.\r\n\r\nA few prominent facts will place this great interest in a just light before\r\nyou. On September 30th, 1815, the funded and floating debt of the United\r\nStates was estimated at $119,635,558. If to this sum be added the amount\r\nof 5% stock subscribed to the Bank of the United States, the amount of\r\nMississippi stock and of the stock which was issued subsequently to that\r\ndate, and as afterwards liquidated, to $158,713,049.\r\n\r\nOn September 30th, 1820, it amounted to $91,993,883, having been reduced\r\nin that interval by payments $66,879,165. During this term the expenses\r\nof the Government of the United States were likewise defrayed in every\r\nbranch of the civil, military, and naval establishments; the public\r\nedifices in this city have been rebuilt with considerable additions;\r\nextensive fortifications have been commenced, and are in a train of\r\nexecution; permanent arsenals and magazines have been erected in various\r\nparts of the Union; our Navy has been considerably augmented, and the\r\nordnance, munitions of war, and stores of the Army and Navy, which were\r\nmuch exhausted during the war, have been replenished.\r\n\r\nBy the discharge of so large a proportion of the public debt and the\r\nexecution of such extensive and important operations in so short a time a\r\njust estimate may be formed of the great extent of our national resources.\r\nThe demonstration is the more complete and gratifying when it is\r\nrecollected that the direct tax and excise were repealed soon after the\r\ntermination of the late war, and that the revenue applied to these purposes\r\nhas been derived almost wholly from other sources.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury from every source to the 30th of September\r\nlast have amounted to $16,794,107.66, whilst the public expenditures to the\r\nsame period amounted to $16,871,534.72, leaving in the Treasury on that day\r\na sum estimated at $1.95 millions. For the probable receipts of the\r\nfollowing year I refer you to the statement which will be transmitted from\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe sum of $3 millions authorized to be raised by loan by an act of the\r\nlast session of Congress has been obtained upon terms advantageous to the\r\nGovernment, indicating not only an increased confidence in the faith of the\r\nnation, but the existence of a large amount of capital seeking that mode of\r\ninvestment at a rate of interest not exceeding 5% per annum.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to add that there is now due to the Treasury for the sale of\r\npublic lands $22,996,545. In bringing this subject to view I consider it my\r\nduty to submit to Congress whether it may not be advisable to extend to the\r\npurchasers of these lands, in consideration of the unfavorable change which\r\nhas occurred since the sales, a reasonable indulgence. It is known that the\r\npurchases were made when the price of every article had risen to its\r\ngreatest height, and the installments are becoming due at a period of great\r\ndepression. It is presumed that some plan may be devised by the wisdom of\r\nCongress, compatible with the public interest, which would afford great\r\nrelief to these purchasers.\r\n\r\nConsiderable progress has been made during the present season in examining\r\nthe coast and its various bays and other inlets, in the collection of\r\nmaterials, and in the construction of fortifications for the defense of the\r\nUnion at several of the positions at which it has been decided to erect\r\nsuch works. At Mobile Point and Dauphin Island, and at the Rigolets,\r\nleading to Lake Pontchartrain, materials to a considerable amount have been\r\ncollected, and all the necessary preparations made for the commencement of\r\nthe works. At Old Point Comfort, at the mouth of the James River, and at\r\nthe Rip-Rap, on the opposite shore in the Chesapeake Bay, materials to a\r\nvast amount have been collected; and at the Old Point some progress has\r\nbeen made in the construction of the fortification, which is on a very\r\nextensive scale. The work at Fort Washington, on this river, will be\r\ncompleted early in the next spring, and that on the Pea Patch, in the\r\nDelaware, in the course of the next season. Fort Diamond, at the Narrows,\r\nin the harbor of New York, will be finished this year. The works at\r\nBoston, New York, Baltimore, Norfolk, Charleston, and Niagara have been\r\nin part repaired, and the coast of North Carolina, extending south to\r\nCape Fear, has been examined, as have likewise other parts of the coast\r\neastward of Boston.\r\n\r\nGreat exertions have been made to push forward these works with the utmost\r\ndispatch possible; but when their extent is considered, with the important\r\npurposes for which they are intended--the defense of the whole coast, and,\r\nin consequence, of the whole interior--and that they are to last for ages,\r\nit will be manifest that a well-digested plan, founded on military\r\nprinciples, connecting the whole together, combining security with economy,\r\ncould not be prepared without repeated examinations of the most exposed and\r\ndifficult parts, and that it would also take considerable time to collect\r\nthe materials at the several points where they would be required.\r\n\r\nFrom all the light that has been shed on this subject I am satisfied that\r\nevery favorable anticipation which has been formed of this great\r\nundertaking will be verified, and that when completed it will afford very\r\ngreat if not complete protection to our Atlantic frontier in the event of\r\nanother war--protection sufficient to counterbalance in a single campaign\r\nwith an enemy powerful at sea the expense of all these works, without\r\ntaking into the estimate the saving of the lives of so many of our\r\ncitizens, the protection of our towns and other property, or the tendency\r\nof such works to prevent war.\r\n\r\nOur military positions have been maintained at Belle Point, on the\r\nArkansas, at Council Bluffs, on the Missouri, at St. Peters, on the\r\nMississippi, and at Green Bay, on the upper Lakes. Commodious barracks have\r\nalready been erected at most of these posts, with such works as were\r\nnecessary for their defense. Progress has also been made in opening\r\ncommunications between them and in raising supplies at each for the support\r\nof the troops by their own labor, particularly those most remote.\r\n\r\nWith the Indians peace has been preserved and a progress made in carrying\r\ninto effect the act of Congress making an appropriation for their\r\ncivilization, with the prospect of favorable results. As connected equally\r\nwith both these objects, our trade with those tribes is thought to merit\r\nthe attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn their original state game is their sustenance and war their occupation,\r\nand if they find no employment from civilized powers they destroy each\r\nother. Left to themselves their extirpation is inevitable.\r\n\r\nBy a judicious regulation of our trade with them we supply their wants,\r\nadminister to their comforts, and gradually, as the game retires, draw them\r\nto us. By maintaining posts far in the interior we acquire a more thorough\r\nand direct control over them, without which it is confidently believed that\r\na complete change in their manners can never be accomplished. By such\r\nposts, aided by a proper regulation of our trade with them and a judicious\r\ncivil administration over them, to be provided for by law, we shall, it is\r\npresumed, be enabled not only to protect our own settlements from their\r\nsavage incursions and preserve peace among the several tribes, but\r\naccomplish also the great purpose of their civilization.\r\n\r\nConsiderable progress has also been made in the construction of ships of\r\nwar, some of which have been launched in the course of the present year.\r\n\r\nOur peace with the powers on the coast of Barbary has been preserved, but\r\nwe owe it altogether to the presence of our squadron in the Mediterranean.\r\nIt has been found equally necessary to employ some of our vessels for the\r\nprotection of our commerce in the Indian Sea, the Pacific, and along the\r\nAtlantic coast. The interests which we have depending in those quarters,\r\nwhich have been much improved of late, are of great extent and of high\r\nimportance to the nation as well as to the parties concerned, and would\r\nundoubtedly suffer if such protection was not extended to them. In\r\nexecution of the law of the last session for the suppression of the slave\r\ntrade some of our public ships have also been employed on the coast of\r\nAfrica, where several captures have already been made of vessels engaged in\r\nthat disgraceful traffic.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Monroe\r\nDecember 3, 1821\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe progress of our affairs since the last session has been such as may\r\njustly be claimed and expected under a Government deriving all its powers\r\nfrom an enlightened people, and under laws formed by their representatives,\r\non great consideration, for the sole purpose of promoting the welfare and\r\nhappiness of their constituents. In the execution of those laws and of the\r\npowers vested by the Constitution in the Executive, unremitted attention\r\nhas been paid to the great objects to which they extend.\r\n\r\nIn the concerns which are exclusively internal there is good cause to be\r\nsatisfied with the result. The laws have had their due operation and\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIn those relating to foreign powers, I am happy to state that peace and\r\namity are preserved with all by a strict observance on both sides of the\r\nrights of each.\r\n\r\nIn matters touching our commercial intercourse, where a difference of\r\nopinion has existed as to the conditions on which it should be placed, each\r\nparty has pursued its own policy without giving just cause of offense to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIn this annual communication, especially when it is addressed to a new\r\nCongress, the whole scope of our political concerns naturally comes into\r\nview, that errors, if such have been committed, may be corrected; that\r\ndefects which have become manifest may be remedied; and, on the other hand,\r\nthat measures which were adopted on due deliberation, and which experience\r\nhas shewn are just in themselves and essential to the public welfare,\r\nshould be persevered in and supported. In performing this necessary and\r\nvery important duty I shall endeavor to place before you on its merits\r\nevery subject that is thought to be entitled to your particular attention\r\nin as distinct and clear a light as I may be able.\r\n\r\nBy an act of March 3rd, 1815, so much of the several acts as imposed higher\r\nduties on the tonnage of foreign vessels and on the manufactures and\r\nproductions of foreign nations when imported into the United States in\r\nforeign vessels than when imported in vessels of the United States were\r\nrepealed so far as respected the manufactures and productions of the nation\r\nto which such vessels belonged, on the condition that the repeal should\r\ntake effect only in favor of any foreign nation when the Executive should\r\nbe satisfied that such discriminating duties to the disadvantage of the\r\nUnited States had likewise been repealed by such nation.\r\n\r\nBy this act a proposition was made to all nations to place our commerce\r\nwith each on a basis which it was presumed would be acceptable to all.\r\nEvery nation was allowed to bring its manufactures and productions into our\r\nports and to take the manufactures and productions of the United States\r\nback to their ports in their own vessels on the same conditions that they\r\nmight be transported in vessels of the United States, and in return it was\r\nrequired that a like accommodation should be granted to the vessels of the\r\nUnited States in the ports of other powers. The articles to be admitted or\r\nprohibited on either side formed no part of the proposed arrangement. Each\r\nparty would retain the right to admit or prohibit such articles from the\r\nother as it thought proper, and on its own conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen the nature of the commerce between the United States and every other\r\ncountry was taken into view, it was thought that this proposition would be\r\nconsidered fair, and even liberal, by every power. The exports of the\r\nUnited States consist generally of articles of the first necessity and of\r\nrude materials in demand for foreign manufactories, of great bulk,\r\nrequiring for their transportation many vessels, the return for which in\r\nthe manufactures and productions of any foreign country, even when disposed\r\nof there to advantage, may be brought in a single vessel. This observation\r\nis the more especially applicable to those countries from which\r\nmanufactures alone are imported, but it applies in great extent to the\r\nEuropean dominions of every European power and in a certain extent to all\r\nthe colonies of those powers. By placing, then, the navigation precisely on\r\nthe same ground in the transportation of exports and imports between the\r\nUnited States and other countries it was presumed that all was offered\r\nwhich could be desired. It seemed to be the only proposition which could be\r\ndevised which would retain even the semblance of equality in our favor.\r\n\r\nMany considerations of great weight gave us a right to expect that this\r\ncommerce should be extended to the colonies as well as to the European\r\ndominions of other powers. With the latter, especially with countries\r\nexclusively manufacturing, the advantage was manifestly on their side. An\r\nindemnity for that loss was expected from a trade with the colonies, and\r\nwith the greater reason as it was known that the supplies which the\r\ncolonies derived from us were of the highest importance to them, their\r\nlabor being bestowed with so much greater profit in the culture of other\r\narticles; and because, likewise, the articles of which those supplies\r\nconsisted, forming so large a proportion of the exports of the United\r\nStates, were never admitted into any of the ports of Europe except in cases\r\nof great emergency to avert a serious calamity.\r\n\r\nWhen no article is admitted which is not required to supply the wants of\r\nthe party admitting it, and admitted then not in favor of any particular\r\ncountry to the disadvantage of others, but on conditions equally applicable\r\nto all, it seems just that the articles thus admitted and invited should be\r\ncarried thither in the vessels of the country affording such supply and\r\nthat the reciprocity should be found in a corresponding accommodation on\r\nthe other side. By allowing each party to participate in the transportation\r\nof such supplies on the payment of equal tonnage a strong proof was\r\nafforded of an accommodating spirit. To abandon to it the transportation of\r\nthe whole would be a sacrifice which ought not to be expected. The demand\r\nin the present instance would be the more unreasonable in consideration of\r\nthe great inequality existing in the trade with the parent country.\r\n\r\nSuch was the basis of our system as established by the act of 1815 and such\r\nits true character. In the year in which this act was passed a treaty was\r\nconcluded with Great Britain, in strict conformity with its principles, in\r\nregard to her European dominions. To her colonies, however, in the West\r\nIndies and on this continent it was not extended, the British Government\r\nclaiming the exclusive supply of those colonies, and from our own ports,\r\nand of the productions of the colonies in return in her own vessels. To\r\nthis claim the United States could not assent, and in consequence each\r\nparty suspended the intercourse in the vessels of the other by a\r\nprohibition which still exists.\r\n\r\nThe same conditions were offered to France, but not accepted. Her\r\nGovernment has demanded other conditions more favorable to her navigation,\r\nand which should also give extraordinary encouragement to her manufactures\r\nand productions in ports of the United States. To these it was thought\r\nimproper to accede, and in consequence the restrictive regulations which\r\nhad been adopted on her part, being countervailed on the part of the United\r\nStates, the direct commerce between the two countries in the vessels of\r\neach party has been in great measure suspended. It is much to be regretted\r\nthat, although a negotiation has been long pending, such is the diversity\r\nof views entertained on the various points which have been brought into\r\ndiscussion that there does not appear to be any reasonable prospect of its\r\nearly conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to state, as a cause of very great regret, that very serious\r\ndifferences have occurred in this negotiation respecting the construction\r\nof the 8th article of the treaty of 1803, by which Louisiana was ceded to\r\nthe United States, and likewise respecting the seizure of the Apollo, in\r\n1820, for a violation of our revenue laws. The claim of the Government of\r\nFrance has excited not less surprise than concern, because there does not\r\nappear to be a just foundation for it in either instance. By the 8th\r\narticle of the treaty referred to it is stipulated that after the\r\nexpiration of twelve years, during which time it was provided by the 7th or\r\npreceding article that the vessels of France and Spain should be admitted\r\ninto the ports of the ceded territory without paying higher duties on\r\nmerchandise or tonnage on the vessels than such as were paid by citizens of\r\nthe United States, the ships of France should forever afterwards be placed\r\non the footing of the most favored nation.\r\n\r\nBy the obvious construction of this article it is presumed that it was\r\nintended that no favor should be granted to any power in those ports to\r\nwhich France should not be forthwith entitled, nor should any accommodation\r\nbe allowed to another power on conditions to which she would not also be\r\nentitled on the same conditions. Under this construction no favor or\r\naccommodation could be granted to any power to the prejudice of France. By\r\nallowing the equivalent allowed by those powers she would always stand in\r\nthose ports on the footing of the most favored nation.\r\n\r\nBut if this article should be so construed as that France should enjoy, of\r\nright, and without paying the equivalent, all the advantages of such\r\nconditions as might be allowed to other powers in return for important\r\nconcessions made by them, then the whole character of the stipulations\r\nwould be changed. She would not be placed on the footing of the most\r\nfavored nation, but on a footing held by no other nation. She would enjoy\r\nall advantages allowed to them in consideration of like advantages allowed\r\nto us, free from every and any condition whatever.\r\n\r\nAs little cause has the Government of France to complain of the seizure of\r\nthe Apollo and the removal of other vessels from the waters of the St.\r\nMarys. It will not be denied that every nation has a right to regulate its\r\ncommercial system as it thinks fit and to enforce the collection of its\r\nrevenue, provided it be done without an invasion of the rights of other\r\npowers. The violation of its revenue laws is an offense which all nations\r\npunish, the punishment of which gives no just cause of complaint to the\r\npower to which the offenders belong, provided it be extended to all\r\nequally.\r\n\r\nIn this case every circumstance which occurred indicated a fixed purpose to\r\nviolate our revenue laws. Had the party intended to have pursued a fair\r\ntrade he would have entered the port of some other power, landed his goods\r\nat the custom house according to law, and re-shipped and sent them in the\r\nvessel of such power, or of some other power which might lawfully bring\r\nthem, free from such duties, to a port of the United States. But the\r\nconduct of the party in this case was altogether different. He entered the\r\nriver St. Marys, the boundary line between the United States and Florida,\r\nand took his position on the Spanish side, on which in the whole extent of\r\nthe river there was no town, no port or custom house, and scarcely any\r\nsettlement. His purpose, therefore, was not to sell his goods to the\r\ninhabitants of Florida, but to citizens of the United States, in exchange\r\nfor their productions, which could not be done without a direct and\r\npalpable breach of our laws. It is known that a regular systematic plan had\r\nbeen formed by certain persons for the violation of our revenue system,\r\nwhich made it the more necessary to check the proceeding in its\r\ncommencement.\r\n\r\nThat the unsettled bank of a river so remote from the Spanish garrisons and\r\npopulation could give no protection to any party in such a practice is\r\nbelieved to be in strict accord with the law of nations. It would not have\r\ncomported with a friendly policy in Spain herself to have established a\r\ncustom house there, since it could have subserved no other purpose than to\r\nelude our revenue law. But the Government of Spain did not adopt that\r\nmeasure. On the contrary, it is understood that the Captain-General of\r\nCuba, to whom an application to that effect was made by these adventurers,\r\nhad not acceded to it.\r\n\r\nThe condition of those Provinces for many years before they were ceded to\r\nthe United States need not now be dwelt on. Inhabited by different tribes\r\nof Indians and an inroad for every kind of adventurer, the jurisdiction of\r\nSpain may be said to have been almost exclusively confined to her\r\ngarrisons. It certainly could not extend to places where she had no\r\nauthority. The rules, therefore, applicable to settled countries governed\r\nby laws could not be deemed so to the deserts of Florida and to the\r\noccurrences there.\r\n\r\nIt merits attention also that the territory had been ceded to the United\r\nStates by a treaty the ratification of which had not been refused, and\r\nwhich has since been performed. Under any circumstances, therefore, Spain\r\nbecame less responsible for such acts committed there, and the United\r\nStates more at liberty to exercise authority to prevent so great a\r\nmischief. The conduct of this Government has in every instance been\r\nconciliatory and friendly to France. The construction of our revenue law in\r\nits application to the cases which have formed the ground of such serious\r\ncomplaint on her part and the order to the collector of St. Marys, in\r\naccord with it, were given two years before these cases occurred, and in\r\nreference to a breach which was attempted by the subjects of another power.\r\nThe application, therefore, to the cases in question was inevitable. As\r\nsoon as the treaty by which these Provinces were ceded to the United States\r\nwas ratified, and all danger of further breach of our revenue laws ceased,\r\nan order was given for the release of the vessel which had been seized and\r\nfor the dismission of the libel which had been instituted against her.\r\n\r\nThe principles of this system of reciprocity, founded on the law of\r\nMarch 3rd, 1815, have been since carried into effect with the Kingdoms of\r\nthe Netherlands, Sweden, Prussia, and with Hamburg, Lubeck, and Oldenburg,\r\nwith a provision made by subsequent laws in regard to the Netherlands,\r\nPrussia, Hamburg, and Bremen that such produce and manufactures as could\r\nonly be, or most usually were, first shipped from the ports of those\r\ncountries, the same being imported in vessels wholly belonging to their\r\nsubjects, should be considered and admitted as their own manufactures and\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Norway has by an ordinance opened the ports of that part\r\nof the dominions of the King of Sweden to the vessels of the United States\r\nupon the payment of no other or higher duties than are paid by Norwegian\r\nvessels, from whatever place arriving and with whatever articles laden.\r\nThey have requested the reciprocal allowance for the vessels of Norway in\r\nthe ports of the United States. As this privilege is not within the scope\r\nof the act of March 3rd, 1815, and can only be granted by Congress, and as\r\nit may involve the commercial relations of the United States with other\r\nnations, the subject is submitted to the wisdom of Congress.\r\n\r\nI have presented thus fully to your view our commercial relations with\r\nother powers, that, seeing them in detail with each power, and knowing the\r\nbasis on which they rest, Congress may in its wisdom decide whether any\r\nchange ought to be made, and, if any, in what respect. If this basis is\r\nunjust or unreasonable, surely it ought to be abandoned; but if it be just\r\nand reasonable, and any change in it will make concessions subversive of\r\nequality and tending in its consequences to sap the foundations of our\r\nprosperity, then the reasons are equally strong for adhering to the ground\r\nalready taken, and supporting it by such further regulations as may appear\r\nto be proper, should any additional support be found necessary.\r\n\r\nThe question concerning the construction of the first article of the treaty\r\nof Ghent has been, by a joint act of the representatives of the United\r\nStates and of Great Britain at the Court of St. Petersburg, submitted to\r\nthe decision of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia. The result of\r\nthat submission has not yet been received. The commissioners under the 5th\r\narticle of that treaty not having been able to agree upon their decision,\r\ntheir reports to the two Governments, according to the provisions of the\r\ntreaty, may be expected at an early day.\r\n\r\nWith Spain the treaty of February 22nd, 1819, has been partly carried into\r\nexecution. Possession of East and West Florida has been given to the\r\nUnited States, but the officers charged with that service by an order\r\nfrom His Catholic Majesty, delivered by his minister to the Secretary of\r\nState, and transmitted by a special agent to the Captain-General of Cuba,\r\nto whom it was directed and in whom the Government of those Provinces\r\nwas vested, have not only omitted, in contravention of the order of their\r\nSovereign, the performance of the express stipulation to deliver over the\r\narchives and documents relating to the property and sovereignty of those\r\nProvinces, all of which it was expected would have been delivered either\r\nbefore or when the troops were withdrawn, but defeated since every effort\r\nof the United States to obtain them, especially those of the greatest\r\nimportance. This omission has given rise to several incidents of a painful\r\nnature, the character of which will be fully disclosed by the documents\r\nwhich will be hereafter communicated.\r\n\r\nIn every other circumstance of the law of the 3rd of March last, for\r\ncarrying into effect that treaty, has been duly attended to. For the\r\nexecution of that part which preserved in force, for the Government of the\r\ninhabitants for the term specified, all the civil, military, and judicial\r\npowers exercised by the existing Government of those Provinces an adequate\r\nnumber of officers, as was presumed, were appointed, and ordered to their\r\nrespective stations. Both Provinces were formed into one Territory, and a\r\ngovernor appointed for it; but in consideration of the pre-existing\r\ndivision and of the distance and difficulty of communication between\r\nPensacola, the residence of the governor of West Florida, and St.\r\nAugustine, that of the governor of East Florida, at which places the\r\ninconsiderable population of each Province was principally collected, two\r\nsecretaries were appointed, the one to reside at Pensacola and the other at\r\nSt. Augustine.\r\n\r\nDue attention was likewise paid to the execution of the laws of the United\r\nStates relating to the revenue and the slave trade, which were extended to\r\nthese Provinces. The whole Territory was divided into three collection\r\ndistricts, that part lying between the river St. Marys and Cape Florida\r\nforming one, that from the Cape to the Apalachicola another, and that from\r\nthe Apalachicola to the Perdido the third. To these districts the usual\r\nnumber of revenue officers were appointed; and to secure the due operation\r\nof these laws one judge and a district attorney were appointed to reside at\r\nPensacola, and likewise one judge and a district attorney to reside at St.\r\nAugustine, with a specified boundary between them; and one marshal for the\r\nwhole, with authority to appoint a deputy.\r\n\r\nIn carrying this law into effect, and especially that part relating to the\r\npowers of the existing Government of those Provinces, it was thought\r\nimportant, in consideration of the short term for which it was to operate\r\nand the radical change which would be made at the approaching session of\r\nCongress, to avoid expense, to make no appointment which should not be\r\nabsolutely necessary to give effect to those powers, to withdraw none of\r\nour citizens from their pursuits, whereby to subject the Government to\r\nclaims which could not be gratified and the parties to losses which it\r\nwould be painful to witness.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen with much concern that in the performance of these duties\r\na collision arose between the governor of the Territory and the judge\r\nappointed for the western district. It was presumed that the law under\r\nwhich this transitory Government was organized, and the commissions which\r\nwere granted to the officers who were appointed to execute each branch of\r\nthe system, and to which the commissions were adapted, would have been\r\nunderstood in the same sense by them in which they were understood by the\r\nExecutive. Much allowance is due to officers employed in each branch of\r\nthis system, and the more so as there is good cause to believe that each\r\nacted under the conviction that he possessed the power which he undertook\r\nto exercise. Of the officer holding the principal station, I think it\r\nproper to observe that he accepted it with reluctance, in compliance with\r\nthe invitation given him, and from a high sense of duty to his country,\r\nbeing willing to contribute to the consummation of an event which would\r\ninsure complete protection to an important part of our Union, which had\r\nsuffered much from incursion and invasion, and to the defense of which his\r\nvery gallant and patriotic services had been so signally and usefully\r\ndevoted.\r\n\r\nFrom the intrinsic difficulty of executing laws deriving their origin from\r\ndifferent sources, and so essentially different in many important\r\ncircumstances, the advantage, and indeed the necessity, of establishing as\r\nsoon as practicable a well-organized Government over that Territory on the\r\nprinciples of our system is apparent. This subject is therefore recommended\r\nto the early consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with an injunction of the law of the 3rd of March last, three\r\ncommissioners have also been appointed and a board organized for carrying\r\ninto effect the 11th article of the treaty above recited, making provision\r\nfor the payment of such of our citizens as have well-founded claims on\r\nSpain of the character specified by that treaty. This board has entered on\r\nits duties and made some progress therein. The commissioner and surveyor of\r\nHis Catholic Majesty, provided for by the 4th article of the treaty, have\r\nnot yet arrived in the United States, but are soon expected. As soon as\r\nthey do arrive corresponding appointments will be made and every facility\r\nbe afforded for the due execution of this service.\r\n\r\nThe Government of His Most Faithful Majesty since the termination of the\r\nlast session of Congress has been removed from Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon,\r\nwhere a revolution similar to that which had occurred in the neighboring\r\nKingdom of Spain had in like manner been sanctioned by the accepted and\r\npledged faith of the reigning monarch. The diplomatic intercourse between\r\nthe United States and the Portuguese dominions, interrupted by this\r\nimportant event, has not yet been resumed, but the change of internal\r\nadministration having already materially affected the commercial\r\nintercourse of the United States with the Portuguese dominions, the renewal\r\nof the public missions between the two countries appears to be desirable at\r\nan early day.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the colonies in South America have had great success\r\nduring the present year in the struggle for their independence. The new\r\nGovernment of Colombia has extended its territories and considerably\r\naugmented its strength, and at Buenos Ayres, where civil dissensions had\r\nfor some time before prevailed, greater harmony and better order appear to\r\nhave been established. Equal success has attended their efforts in the\r\nProvinces on the Pacific. It has long been manifest that it would be\r\nimpossible for Spain to reduce these colonies by force, and equally so that\r\nno conditions short of their independence would be satisfactory to them. It\r\nmay therefore be presumed, and it is earnestly hoped, that the Government\r\nof Spain, guided by enlightened and liberal councils, will find it to\r\ncomport with its interests and due to its magnanimity to terminate this\r\nexhausting controversy on that basis. To promote this result by friendly\r\ncounsel with the Government of Spain will be the object of the Government\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the fiscal operations of the year it has been found necessary\r\nto carry into full effect the act of the last session of Congress\r\nauthorizing a loan of $5 millions. This sum has been raised at an average\r\npremium of $5.59 per centum upon stock bearing an interest at the rate of\r\n5% per annum, redeemable at the option of the Government after January\r\n1st, 1835.\r\n\r\nThere has been issued under the provisions of this act $4,735,296.30 of 5%\r\nstock, and there has been or will be redeemed during the year $3,197,030.71\r\nof Louisiana 6% deferred stock and Mississippi stock. There has therefore\r\nbeen an actual increase of the public debt contracted during the year of\r\n$1,538,266.69.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury from the first of January to the 30th of\r\nSeptember last have amounted to $16,219,197.70, which, with the balance of\r\n$1,198,461.21 in the Treasury on the former day, make the aggregate sum of\r\n$17,417,658.91. The payments from the Treasury during the same period have\r\namounted to $15,655,288.47, leaving in the Treasury on the last-mentioned\r\nday the sum of $1,762,370.44. It is estimated that the receipts of the 4th\r\nquarter of the year will exceed the demands which will be made on the\r\nTreasury during the same period, and that the amount in the Treasury on the\r\n30th of September last will be increased on the first day of January next.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last session it was anticipated that the progressive\r\ndiminution of the public revenue in 1819 and 1820, which had been the\r\nresult of the languid state of our foreign commerce in those years, had in\r\nthe latter year reached its extreme point of depression. It has, however,\r\nbeen ascertained that that point was reached only at the termination of the\r\nfirst quarter of the present year. From that time until the 30th of\r\nSeptember last the duties secured have exceeded those of the corresponding\r\nquarters of the last year $1.172 millions, whilst the amount of debentures\r\nissued during the three first quarters of this year is $952,000 less than\r\nthat of the same quarters of the last year.\r\n\r\nThere are just grounds to believe that the improvement which has occurred\r\nin the revenue during the last-mentioned period will not only be\r\nmaintained, but that it will progressively increase through the next and\r\nseveral succeeding years, so as to realize the results which were presented\r\nupon that subject by the official reports of the Treasury at the\r\ncommencement of the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the most unfavorable circumstances the revenue for\r\nthe next and subsequent years to the year 1825 will exceed the demands at\r\npresent authorized by law.\r\n\r\nIt may fairly be presumed that under the protection given to domestic\r\nmanufactures by the existing laws we shall become at no distant period a\r\nmanufacturing country on an extensive scale. Possessing as we do the raw\r\nmaterials in such vast amount, with a capacity to augment them to an\r\nindefinite extent; raising within the country aliment of every kind to an\r\namount far exceeding the demand for home consumption, even in the most\r\nunfavorable years, and to be obtained always at a very moderate price;\r\nskilled also, as our people are, in the mechanic arts and in every\r\nimprovement calculated to lessen the demand for and the price of labor, it\r\nis manifest that their success in every branch of domestic industry may and\r\nwill be carried, under the encouragement given by the present duties, to an\r\nextent to meet any demand which under a fair competition may be made upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA considerable increase of domestic manufactures, by diminishing the\r\nimportation of foreign, will probably tend to lessen the amount of the\r\npublic revenue. As, however, a large proportion of the revenue which is\r\nderived from duties is raised from other articles than manufactures, the\r\ndemand for which will increase with our population, it is believed that a\r\nfund will still be raised from that source adequate to the greater part of\r\nthe public expenditures, especially as those expenditures, should we\r\ncontinue to be blessed with peace, will be diminished by the completion of\r\nthe fortifications, dock yards, and other public works, by the augmentation\r\nof the Navy to the point to which it is proposed to carry it, and by the\r\npayment of the public debt, including pensions for military services.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that the more complete our internal resources and the\r\nless dependent we are on foreign powers for every national as well as\r\ndomestic purpose the greater and more stable will be the public felicity.\r\nBy the increase of domestic manufactures will the demand for the rude\r\nmaterials at home be increased, and thus will the dependence of the several\r\nparts of our Union on each other and the strength of the Union itself be\r\nproportionably augmented.\r\n\r\nIn this process, which is very desirable, and inevitable under the existing\r\nduties, the resources which obviously present themselves to supply a\r\ndeficiency in the revenue, should it occur, are the interests which may\r\nderive the principal benefit from the change. If domestic manufactures are\r\nraised by duties on foreign, the deficiency in the fund necessary for\r\npublic purposes should be supplied by duties on the former.\r\n\r\nAt the last session it seemed doubtful whether the revenue derived from the\r\npresent sources would be adequate to all the great purposes of our Union,\r\nincluding the construction of our fortifications, the augmentation of the\r\nNavy, and the protection of our commerce against the dangers to which it is\r\nexposed. Had the deficiency been such as to subject us to the necessity\r\neither to abandon those measures of defense or to resort to the other means\r\nfor adequate funds, the course presented to the adoption of a virtuous and\r\nenlightened people appeared to be a plain one. It must be gratifying to all\r\nto know that this necessity does not exist. Nothing, however, in\r\ncontemplation of such important objects, which can be easily provided for,\r\nshould be left to hazard. It is thought that the revenue may receive an\r\naugmentation from the existing sources, and in a manner to aid our\r\nmanufactures, without hastening prematurely the result which has been\r\nsuggested. It is believed that a moderate additional duty on certain\r\narticles would have that effect, without being liable to any serious\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the whole coast, for the construction of permanent\r\nfortifications, from St. Croix to the Sabine, with the exception of part of\r\nthe territory lately acquired, will be completed in the present year, as\r\nwill be the survey of the Mississippi, under the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, from the mouth of the Ohio to the ocean, and likewise of\r\nthe Ohio from Louisville to the Mississippi. A progress corresponding with\r\nthe sums appropriated has also been made in the construction of these\r\nfortifications at the ports designated. As they will form a system of\r\ndefense for the whole maritime frontier, and in consequence for the\r\ninterior, and are to last for ages, the greatest care has been taken to fix\r\nthe position of each work and to form it on such a scale as will be\r\nadequate to the purpose intended by it. All the inlets and assailable parts\r\nof our Union have been minutely examined, and positions taken with a view\r\nto the best effect, observing in every instance a just regard for economy.\r\nDoubts, however, being entertained as to the propriety of the position and\r\nextent of the work at Dauphine Island, further progress in it was suspended\r\nsoon after the last session of Congress, and an order given to the Board of\r\nEngineers and Naval Commissioners to make a further and more minute\r\nexamination of it in both respects, and to report the result without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nDue progress has been made in the construction of vessels of war according\r\nto the law providing for the gradual augmentation of the Navy, and to the\r\nextent of existing appropriations. The vessels authorized by the act of\r\n1820 have all been completed and are now in actual service. None of the\r\nlarger ships have been or will be launched for the present, the object\r\nbeing to protect all which may not be required for immediate service from\r\ndecay by suitable buildings erected over them.\r\n\r\nA squadron has been maintained, as heretofore, in the Mediterranean, by\r\nmeans whereof peace has been preserved with the Barbary Powers. This\r\nsquadron has been reduced the present year to as small a force as is\r\ncompatible with the fulfillment of the object intended by it. From past\r\nexperience and the best information respecting the views of those powers it\r\nis distinctly understood that should our squadron be withdrawn they would\r\nsoon recommence their hostilities and depredations upon our commerce. Their\r\nfortifications have lately been rebuilt and their maritime force\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nIt has also been found necessary to maintain a naval force on the Pacific\r\nfor the protection of the very important interests of our citizens engaged\r\nin commerce and the fisheries in that sea. Vessels have likewise been\r\nemployed in cruising along the Atlantic coast, in the Gulf of Mexico, on\r\nthe coast of Africa, and in the neighboring seas. In the latter many\r\npiracies have been committed on our commerce, and so extensive was becoming\r\nthe range of those unprincipled adventurers that there was cause to\r\napprehend, without a timely and decisive effort to suppress them, the worst\r\nconsequences would ensue. Fortunately, a considerable check has been given\r\nto that spirit by our cruisers, who have succeeded in capturing and\r\ndestroying several of their vessels. Nevertheless, it is considered an\r\nobject of high importance to continue these cruises until the practice is\r\nentirely suppressed.\r\n\r\nLike success has attended our efforts to suppress the slave trade. Under\r\nthe flag of the United States and the sanction of their papers the trade\r\nmay be considered as entirely suppressed, and if any of our citizens are\r\nengaged in it under the flags and papers of other powers, it is only from a\r\nrespect of those powers that these offenders are not seized and brought\r\nhome to receive the punishment which the laws inflict. If every other power\r\nshould adopt the same policy and pursue the same vigorous means for\r\ncarrying it into effect, the trade could no longer exist.\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with the blessings which we enjoy, and of which we have\r\nsuch manifold proofs, my mind is irresistibly drawn to that Almighty Being,\r\nthe great source from whence they proceed and to whom our most grateful\r\nacknowledgments are due.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Monroe\r\nDecember 3, 1822\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nMany causes unite to make your present meeting peculiarly interesting to\r\nout constituents. The operation of our laws on the various subjects to\r\nwhich they apply, with the amendments which they occasionally require,\r\nimposes annually an important duty on the representatives of a free\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOur system has happily advanced to such maturity that I am not aware that\r\nyour cares in that respect will be augmented. Other causes exist which are\r\nhighly interesting to the whole civilized world and to no portion of it\r\nmore so, in certain views, than to the United States. Of these causes and\r\nof their bearing on the interests of our Union I shall communicate the\r\nsentiments which I have formed with that freedom which a sense of duty\r\ndictates. It is proper, however, to invite your attention in the first\r\ninstance to those concerns respecting which legislative provision is\r\nthought to be particularly urgent.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June last a convention of navigation and commerce was\r\nconcluded in this city between the United States and France by ministers\r\nduly authorized for the purpose. The sanction of the Executive having been\r\ngiven to this convention under a conviction that, taking all its\r\nstipulations into view, it rested essentially on a basis of reciprocal and\r\nequal advantage, I deemed it my duty, in compliance with the authority\r\nvested in the Executive by the second section of the act of the last\r\nsession of the 6th of May, concerning navigation, to suspend by\r\nproclamation until the end of the next session of Congress the operation of\r\nthe act entitled \"An act to impose a new tonnage duty on French ships and\r\nvessels, and for other purposes\", and to suspend likewise all other duties\r\non French vessels or the goods imported in them which exceeded the duties\r\non American vessels and on similar goods imported in them. I shall submit\r\nthis convention forthwith to the Senate for its advice and consent as to\r\nthe ratification.\r\n\r\nSince your last session the prohibition which had been imposed on the\r\ncommerce between the United States and the British colonies in the West\r\nIndies and on this continent has likewise been removed. Satisfactory\r\nevidence having been adduced that the ports of those colonies had been\r\nopened to the vessels of the United States by an act of the British\r\nParliament bearing date on the 24th of June last, on the conditions\r\nspecified therein, I deemed it proper, in compliance with the provision of\r\nthe first section of the act of the last session above recited, to declare,\r\nby proclamation bearing date on the 24th of August last, that the ports of\r\nthe United States should thenceforward and until the end of the next\r\nsession of Congress be opened to the vessels of Great Britain employed in\r\nthat trade, under the limitation specified in that proclamation.\r\n\r\nA doubt was entertained whether the act of Congress applied to the British\r\ncolonies on this continent as well as to those in the West Indies, but as\r\nthe act of Parliament opened the intercourse equally with both, and it was\r\nthe manifest intention of Congress, as well as the obvious policy of the\r\nUnited States, that the provisions of the act of Parliament should be met\r\nin equal extent on the part of the United States, and as also the act of\r\nCongress was supposed to vest in the President some discretion in the\r\nexecution of it, I thought it advisable to give it a corresponding\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nShould the constitutional sanction of the Senate be given to the\r\nratification of the convention with France, legislative provisions will be\r\nnecessary to carry it fully into effect, as it likewise will be to continue\r\nin force, on such conditions as may be deemed just and proper, the\r\nintercourse which has been opened between the United States and the British\r\ncolonies. Every light in the possession of the Executive will in due time\r\nbe communicated on both subjects.\r\n\r\nResting essentially on a basis of reciprocal and equal advantage, it has\r\nbeen the object of the Executive in transactions with other powers to meet\r\nthe propositions of each with a liberal spirit, believing that thereby the\r\ninterest of our country would be most effectually promoted. This course has\r\nbeen systematically pursued in the late occurrences with France and Great\r\nBritain, and in strict accord with the views of the Legislature. A\r\nconfident hope is entertained that by the arrangement thus commenced with\r\neach all differences respecting navigation and commerce with the dominions\r\nin question will be adjusted, and a solid foundation be laid for an active\r\nand permanent intercourse which will prove equally advantageous to both\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nThe decision of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia on the question\r\nsubmitted to him by the United States and Great Britain, concerning the\r\nconstruction of the first article of the treaty of Ghent, has been\r\nreceived. A convention has since been concluded between the parties, under\r\nthe mediation of His Imperial Majesty, to prescribe the mode by which that\r\narticle shall be carried into effect in conformity with that decision. I\r\nshall submit this convention to the Senate for its advice and consent as to\r\nthe ratification, and, if obtained, shall immediately bring the subject\r\nbefore Congress for such provisions as may require the interposition of the\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with an act of the last session a Territorial Government has\r\nbeen established in Florida on the principles of our system. By this act\r\nthe inhabitants are secured in the full enjoyment of their rights and\r\nliberties, and to admission into the Union, with equal participation in the\r\nGovernment with the original States on the conditions heretofore prescribed\r\nto other Territories. By a clause in the 9th article of the treaty with\r\nSpain, by which that Territory was ceded to the United States, it is\r\nstipulated that satisfaction shall be made for the injuries, if any, which\r\nby process of law shall be established to have been suffered by the Spanish\r\nofficers and individual Spanish inhabitants by the late operations of our\r\ntroops in Florida. No provision having yet been made to carry that\r\nstipulation into effect, it is submitted to the consideration of Congress\r\nwhether it will not be proper to vest the competent power in the district\r\ncourt at Pensacola, or in some tribunal to be specially organized for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe fiscal operations of the year have been more successful than had been\r\nanticipated at the commencement of the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters of the year\r\nhave exceeded the sum of $14.745 millions. The payments made at the\r\nTreasury during the same period have exceeded $12.279 millions, leaving\r\nthe Treasury on the 30th day of September last, including $1,168,592.24\r\nwhich were in the Treasury on the first day of January last, a sum\r\nexceeding $4.128 millions.\r\n\r\nBesides discharging all demands for the current service of the year,\r\nincluding the interest and reimbursement of the public debt, the 6% stock\r\nof 1796, amounting to $80,000, has been redeemed. It is estimated that,\r\nafter defraying the current expenses of the present quarter and redeeming\r\nthe $2 millions of 6% stock of 1820, there will remain in the Treasury on\r\nthe first of January next nearly $3 millions. It is estimated that the\r\ngross amount of duties which have been secured from the first of January\r\nto the 30th of September last has exceeded $19.5 millions, and the amount\r\nfor the whole year will probably not fall short of $23 millions.\r\n\r\nOf the actual force in service under the present military establishment,\r\nthe posts at which it is stationed, and the condition of each post, a\r\nreport from the Secretary of War which is now communicated will give a\r\ndistinct idea. By like reports the state of the Academy at West Point will\r\nbe seen, as will be the progress which has been made on the fortifications\r\nalong the coast and at the national armories and arsenals.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the several corps composing the Army is such as to\r\nadmit its expansion to a great extent in case of emergency, the officers\r\ncarrying with them all the light which they possess to the new corps to\r\nwhich they might be appointed.\r\n\r\nWith the organization of the staff there is equal cause to be satisfied. By\r\nthe concentration of every branch with its chief in this city, in the\r\npresence of the Department, and with a grade in the chief military station\r\nto keep alive and cherish a military spirit, the greatest promptitude in\r\nthe execution of orders, with the greatest economy and efficiency, are\r\nsecured. The same view is taken of the Military Academy. Good order is\r\npreserved in it, and the youth are well instructed in every science\r\nconnected with the great objects of the institution. They are also well\r\ntrained and disciplined in the practical parts of the profession. It has\r\nbeen always found difficult to control the ardor inseparable from that\r\nearly age in such manner as to give it a proper direction. The rights of\r\nmanhood are too often claimed prematurely, in pressing which too far the\r\nrespect which is due to age and the obedience necessary to a course of\r\nstudy and instruction in every such institution are sometimes lost sight\r\nof. The great object to be accomplished is the restraint of that ardor by\r\nsuch wise regulations and Government as, by directing all the energies of\r\nthe youthful mind to the attainment of useful knowledge, will keep it\r\nwithin a just subordination and at the same time elevate it to the highest\r\npurposes. This object seems to be essentially obtained in this institution,\r\nand with great advantage to the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy forms the basis, in regard to science, on which the\r\nmilitary establishment rests. It furnishes annually, after due examination\r\nand on the report of the academic staff, many well-informed youths to fill\r\nthe vacancies which occur in the several corps of the Army, while others\r\nwho retire to private life carry with them such attainments as, under the\r\nright reserved to the several States to appoint the officers and to train\r\nthe militia, will enable them, by affording a wider field for selection, to\r\npromote the great object of the power vested in Congress of providing for\r\nthe organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia. Thus by the mutual\r\nand harmonious cooperation of the two governments in the execution of a\r\npower divided between them, an object always to be cherished, the\r\nattainment of a great result, on which our liberties may depend, can not\r\nfail to be secured. I have to add that in proportion as our regular force\r\nis small should the instruction and discipline of the militia, the great\r\nresource on which we rely, be pushed to the utmost extent that\r\ncircumstances will admit.\r\n\r\nA report from the Secretary of the Navy will communicate the progress which\r\nhas been made in the construction of vessels of war, with other interesting\r\ndetails respecting the actual state of the affairs of that Department. It\r\nhas been found necessary for the protection of our commerce to maintain the\r\nusual squadrons on the Mediterranean, the Pacific, and along the Atlantic\r\ncoast, extending the cruises of the latter into the West Indies, where\r\npiracy, organized into a system, has preyed on the commerce of every\r\ncountry trading thither. A cruise has also been maintained on the coast of\r\nAfrica, when the season would permit, for the suppression of the slave\r\ntrade, and orders have been given to the commanders of all our public ships\r\nto seize our own vessels, should they find any engaging in that trade, and\r\nto bring them in for adjudication.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies piracy is of recent date, which may explain the cause\r\nwhy other powers have not combined against it. By the documents\r\ncommunicated it will be seen that the efforts of the United States to\r\nsuppress it have had a very salutary effect. The benevolent provision of\r\nthe act under which the protection has been extended alike to the commerce\r\nof other nations can not fail to be duly appreciated by them.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the act of the last session entitled \"An act to abolish\r\nthe United States trading establishments\", agents were immediately\r\nappointed and instructed, under the direction of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, to close the business of the trading houses among the Indian\r\ntribes and to settle the accounts of the factors and sub-factors engaged\r\nin that trade, and to execute in all other respects the injunction of that\r\nact in the mode prescribed therein. A final report of their proceedings\r\nshall be communicated to Congress as soon as it is received.\r\n\r\nIt is with great regret I have to state that a serious malady has deprived\r\nus of many valuable citizens of Pensacola and checked the progress of some\r\nof those arrangements which are important to the Territory. This effect has\r\nbeen sensibly felt in respect to the Indians who inhabit that Territory,\r\nconsisting of the remnants of the several tribes who occupy the middle\r\nground between St. Augustine and Pensacola, with extensive claims but\r\nundefined boundaries. Although peace is preserved with those Indians, yet\r\ntheir position and claims tend essentially to interrupt the intercourse\r\nbetween the eastern and western parts of the Territory, on which our\r\ninhabitants are principally settled. It is essential to the growth and\r\nprosperity of the Territory, as well as to the interests of the Union, that\r\nthose Indians should be removed, by special compact with them, to some\r\nother position or concentration within narrower limits where they are. With\r\nthe limited means in the power of the Executive, instructions were given to\r\nthe governor to accomplish this object so far as it might be practicable,\r\nwhich was prevented by the distressing malady referred to. To carry it\r\nfully into effect in either mode additional funds will be necessary, to the\r\nprovision of which the powers of Congress are competent. With a view to\r\nsuch provision as may be deemed proper, the subject is submitted to your\r\nconsideration, and in the interim further proceedings are suspended.\r\n\r\nIt appearing that so much of the act entitled \"An act regulating the staff\r\nof the Army\", which passed on April 14, 1818, as relates to the\r\ncommissariat will expire in April next, and the practical operation of\r\nthat department having evinced its great utility, the propriety of its\r\nrenewal is submitted to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe view which has been taken of the probable productiveness of the lead\r\nmines, connected with the importance of the material to the public defense,\r\nmakes it expedient that they should be managed with peculiar care. It is\r\ntherefore suggested whether it will not comport with the public interest to\r\nprovide by law for the appointment of an agent skilled in mineralogy to\r\nsuperintend them, under the direction of the proper department.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the Cumberland road, which was constructed at great\r\nexpense, has already suffered from the want of that regular superintendence\r\nand of those repairs which are indispensable to the preservation of such a\r\nwork. This road is of incalculable advantage in facilitating the\r\nintercourse between the Western and the Atlantic States. Through the whole\r\ncountry from the northern extremity of Lake Erie to the Mississippi, and\r\nfrom all the waters which empty into each, finds an easy and direct\r\ncommunication to the seat of Government, and thence to the Atlantic. The\r\nfacility which it affords to all military and commercial operations, and\r\nalso to those of the Post Office Department, can not be estimated too\r\nhighly. This great work is likewise an ornament and an honor to the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nBelieving that a competent power to adopt and execute a system of internal\r\nimprovement has not been granted to Congress, but that such a power,\r\nconfined to great national purposes and with proper limitations, would be\r\nproductive of eminent advantage to our Union, I have thought it advisable\r\nthat an amendment of the Constitution to that effect should be recommended\r\nto the several States.\r\n\r\nA bill which assumed the right to adopt and execute such a system having\r\nbeen presented for my signature at the last session, I was compelled, from\r\nthe view which I had taken of the powers of the General Government, to\r\nnegative it, on which occasion I thought it proper to communicate the\r\nsentiments which I had formed, on mature consideration, on the whole\r\nsubject. To that communication, in all the views in which the great\r\ninterest to which it relates may be supposed to merit your attention, I\r\nhave now to refer. Should Congress, however, deem it improper to recommend\r\nsuch an amendment, they have, according to my judgment, the right to keep\r\nthe road in repair by providing for the superintendence of it and\r\nappropriating the money necessary for repairs. Surely if they had the right\r\nto appropriate money to make the road they have a right to appropriate it\r\nto preserve the road from ruin. From the exercise of this power no danger\r\nis to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nUnder our happy system the people are the sole and exclusive fountain of\r\npower. Each Government originates from them, and to them alone, each to its\r\nproper constituents, are they respectively and solely responsible for the\r\nfaithful discharge of their duties within their constitutional limits; and\r\nthat the people will confine their public agents of every station to the\r\nstrict line of their constitutional duties there is no cause of doubt.\r\n\r\nHaving, however, communicated my sentiments to Congress at the last session\r\nfully in the document to which I have referred, respecting the right of\r\nappropriation as distinct from the right of jurisdiction and sovereignty\r\nover the territory in question, I deem it improper to enlarge on the\r\nsubject here.\r\n\r\nFrom the best information I have been able to obtain it appears that our\r\nmanufactures, though depressed immediately after the peace, have\r\nconsiderably increased, and are still increasing, under the encouragement\r\ngiven them by the tariff of 1816 and by subsequent laws. Satisfied I am,\r\nwhatever may be the abstract doctrine in favor of unrestricted commerce,\r\nprovided all nations would concur in it and it was not liable to be\r\ninterrupted by war, which has never occurred and can not be expected, that\r\nthere are other strong reasons applicable to our situation and relations\r\nwith other countries which impose on us the obligation to cherish and\r\nsustain our manufactures.\r\n\r\nSatisfied, however, I likewise am that the interest of every part of our\r\nUnion, even of those most benefitted by manufactures, requires that this\r\nsubject should be touched with the greatest caution, and a critical\r\nknowledge of the effect to be produced by the slightest change. On full\r\nconsideration of the subject in all its relations I am persuaded that a\r\nfurther augmentation may now be made of the duties on certain foreign\r\narticles in favor of our own and without affecting injuriously any other\r\ninterest. For more precise details I refer you to the communications which\r\nwere made to Congress during the last session.\r\n\r\nSo great was the amount of accounts for moneys advanced during the late\r\nwar, in addition to others of a previous date which in the regular\r\noperations of the Government necessarily remained unsettled, that it\r\nrequired a considerable length of time for their adjustment. By a report\r\nfrom the first Comptroller of the Treasury it appears that on March 4th,\r\n1817, the accounts then unsettled amounted to $103,068,876.41, of which on\r\nSeptember 30th, 1822, $93,175,396.56 had been settled, leaving on that day\r\na balance unsettled of $9,893,479.85. That there have been drawn from the\r\nTreasury, in paying the public debt and sustaining the Government in all\r\nits operations and disbursements, since March 4th, 1817, $157,199,380.96,\r\nthe accounts for which have been settled to the amount of $137,501,451.12,\r\nleaving a balance unsettled of $19,697,929.84. For precise details\r\nrespecting each of these balances I refer to the report of the Comptroller\r\nand the documents which accompany it.\r\n\r\nFrom this view it appears that our commercial differences with France and\r\nGreat Britain have been placed in a train of amicable arrangement on\r\nconditions fair and honorable in both instances to each party; that our\r\nfinances are in a very productive state, our revenue being at present fully\r\ncompetent to all the demands upon it; that our military force is well\r\norganized in all its branches and capable of rendering the most important\r\nservice in case of emergency that its number will admit of; that due\r\nprogress has been made, under existing appropriations, in the construction\r\nof fortifications and in the operations of the Ordnance Department; that\r\ndue progress has in like manner been made in the construction of ships of\r\nwar; that our Navy is in the best condition, felt and respected in every\r\nsea in which it is employed for the protection of our commerce; that our\r\nmanufactures have augmented in amount and improved in quality; that great\r\nprogress has been made in the settlement of accounts and in the recovery of\r\nthe balances due by individuals, and that the utmost economy is secured and\r\nobserved in every Department of the Administration. Other objects will\r\nlikewise claim your attention, because from the station which the United\r\nStates hold as a member of the great community of nations they have rights\r\nto maintain, duties to perform, and dangers to encounter.\r\n\r\nA strong hope was entertained that peace would ere this have been concluded\r\nbetween Spain and the independent governments south of the United States in\r\nthis hemisphere. Long experience having evinced the competency of those\r\ngovernments to maintain the independence which they had declared, it was\r\npresumed that the considerations which induced their recognition by the\r\nUnited States would have had equal weight with other powers, and that Spain\r\nherself, yielding to those magnanimous feelings of which her history\r\nfurnishes so many examples, would have terminated on that basis a\r\ncontroversy so unavailing and at the same time so destructive. We still\r\ncherish the hope that this result will not long be postponed.\r\n\r\nSustaining our neutral position and allowing to each party while the war\r\ncontinues equal rights, it is incumbent on the United States to claim of\r\neach with equal rigor the faithful observance of our rights according to\r\nthe well-known law of nations. From each, therefore, a like cooperation is\r\nexpected in the suppression of the piratical practice which has grown out\r\nof this war and of blockades of extensive coasts on both seas, which,\r\nconsidering the small force employed to sustain them, have not the\r\nslightest foundation to rest on.\r\n\r\nEurope is still unsettled, and although the war long menaced between Russia\r\nand Turkey has not broken out, there is no certainty that the differences\r\nbetween those powers will be amicably adjusted. It is impossible to look to\r\nthe oppressions of the country respecting which those differences arose\r\nwithout being deeply affected. The mention of Greece fills the mind with\r\nthe most exalted sentiments and arouses in our bosoms the best feelings of\r\nwhich our nature is susceptible. Superior skill and refinement in the arts,\r\nheroic gallantry in action, disinterested patriotism, enthusiastic zeal and\r\ndevotion in favor of public and personal liberty are associated with our\r\nrecollections of ancient Greece. That such a country should have been\r\noverwhelmed and so long hidden, as it were, from the world under a gloomy\r\ndespotism has been a cause of unceasing and deep regret to generous minds\r\nfor ages past. It was natural, therefore, that the reappearance of those\r\npeople in their original character, contending in favor of their liberties,\r\nshould produce that great excitement and sympathy in their favor which have\r\nbeen so signally displayed throughout the United States. A strong hope is\r\nentertained that these people will recover their independence and resume\r\ntheir equal station among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nA great effort has been made in Spain and Portugal to improve the condition\r\nof the people, and it must be very consoling to all benevolent minds to see\r\nthe extraordinary moderation with which it has been conducted. That it may\r\npromote the happiness of both nations is the ardent wish of this whole\r\npeople, to the expression of which we confine ourselves; for whatever may\r\nbe the feelings or sentiments which every individual under our Government\r\nhas a right to indulge and express, it is nevertheless a sacred maxim,\r\nequally with the Government and people, that the destiny of every\r\nindependent nation in what relates to such improvements of right belongs\r\nand ought to be left exclusively to themselves.\r\n\r\nWhether we reason from the late wars or from those menacing symptoms which\r\nnow appear in Europe, it is manifest that if a convulsion should take place\r\nin any of those countries it will proceed from causes which have no\r\nexistence and are utterly unknown in these States, in which there is but\r\none order, that of the people, to whom the sovereignty exclusively\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\nShould war break out in any of those countries who can foretell the extent\r\nto which it may be carried or the desolation which it may spread? Exempt as\r\nwe are from these causes, our internal tranquillity is secure; and distant\r\nas we are from the troubled scene, and faithful to first principles in\r\nregard to other powers, we might reasonably presume that we should not be\r\nmolested by them. This, however, ought not to be calculated on as certain.\r\nUnprovoked injuries are often inflicted and even the peculiar felicity of\r\nour situation might with some be a cause for excitement and aggression.\r\n\r\nThe history of the late wars in Europe furnishes a complete demonstration\r\nthat no system of conduct, however correct in principle, can protect\r\nneutral powers from injury from any party; that a defenseless position and\r\ndistinguished love of peace are the surest invitations to war, and that\r\nthere is no way to avoid it other than by being always prepared and willing\r\nfor just cause to meet it. If there be a people on earth whose more\r\nespecial duty it is to be at all times prepared to defend the rights with\r\nwhich they are blessed, and to surpass all others in sustaining the\r\nnecessary burthens, and in submitting to sacrifices to make such\r\npreparations, it is undoubtedly the people of these States.\r\n\r\nWhen we see that a civil war of the most frightful character rages from the\r\nAdriatic to the Black Sea; that strong symptoms of war appear in other\r\nparts, proceeding from causes which, should it break out, may become\r\ngeneral and be of long duration; that the war still continues between Spain\r\nand the independent governments, her late Provinces, in this hemisphere;\r\nthat it is likewise menaced between Portugal and Brazil, in consequence of\r\nthe attempt of the latter to dismember itself from the former, and that a\r\nsystem of piracy of great extent is maintained in the neighboring seas,\r\nwhich will require equal vigilance and decision to suppress it, the reasons\r\nfor sustaining the attitude which we now hold and for pushing forward all\r\nour measures of defense with the utmost vigor appear to me to acquire new\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThe United States owe to the world a great example, and, by means thereof,\r\nto the cause of liberty and humanity a generous support. They have so far\r\nsucceeded to the satisfaction of the virtuous and enlightened of every\r\ncountry. There is no reason to doubt that their whole movement will be\r\nregulated by a sacred regard to principle, all our institutions being\r\nfounded on that basis. The ability to support our own cause under any trial\r\nto which it may be exposed is the great point on which the public\r\nsolicitude rests.\r\n\r\nIt has been often charged against free governments that they have neither\r\nthe foresight nor the virtue to provide at the proper season for great\r\nemergencies; that their course is improvident and expensive; that war will\r\nalways find them unprepared, and, whatever may be its calamities, that its\r\nterrible warnings will be disregarded and forgotten as soon as peace\r\nreturns. I have full confidence that this charge so far as relates to the\r\nUnited States will be shewn to be utterly destitute of truth.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Monroe\r\nDecember 2, 1823\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nMany important subjects will claim your attention during the present\r\nsession, of which I shall endeavor to give, in aid of your deliberations, a\r\njust idea in this communication. I undertake this duty with diffidence,\r\nfrom the vast extent of the interests on which I have to treat and of their\r\ngreat importance to every portion of our Union. I enter on it with zeal\r\nfrom a thorough conviction that there never was a period since the\r\nestablishment of our Revolution when, regarding the condition of the\r\ncivilized world and its bearing on us, there was greater necessity for\r\ndevotion in the public servants to their respective duties, or for virtue,\r\npatriotism, and union in our constituents.\r\n\r\nMeeting in you a new Congress, I deem it proper to present this view of\r\npublic affairs in greater detail than might otherwise be necessary. I do\r\nit, however, with peculiar satisfaction, from a knowledge that in this\r\nrespect I shall comply more fully with the sound principles of our\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe people being with us exclusively the sovereign, it is indispensable\r\nthat full information be laid before them on all important subjects, to\r\nenable them to exercise that high power with complete effect. If kept in\r\nthe dark, they must be incompetent to it. We are all liable to error, and\r\nthose who are engaged in the management of public affairs are more subject\r\nto excitement and to be led astray by their particular interests and\r\npassions than the great body of our constituents, who, living at home in\r\nthe pursuit of their ordinary avocations, are calm but deeply interested\r\nspectators of events and of the conduct of those who are parties to them.\r\n\r\nTo the people every department of the Government and every individual in\r\neach are responsible, and the more full their information the better they\r\ncan judge of the wisdom of the policy pursued and of the conduct of each in\r\nregard to it. From their dispassionate judgment much aid may always be\r\nobtained, while their approbation will form the greatest incentive and most\r\ngratifying reward for virtuous actions, and the dread of their censure the\r\nbest security against the abuse of their confidence. Their interests in all\r\nvital questions are the same, and the bond, by sentiment as well as by\r\ninterest, will be proportionably strengthened as they are better informed\r\nof the real state of public affairs, especially in difficult conjunctures.\r\nIt is by such knowledge that local prejudices and jealousies are\r\nsurmounted, and that a national policy extending its fostering care and\r\nprotection to all the great interests of our Union, is formed and steadily\r\nadhered to.\r\n\r\nA precise knowledge of our relations with foreign powers as respects our\r\nnegotiations and transactions with each is thought to be particularly\r\nnecessary. Equally necessary is it that we should form a just estimate of\r\nour resources, revenue, and progress in every kind of improvement connected\r\nwith the national prosperity and public defense. It is by rendering justice\r\nto other nations that we may expect it from them. It is by our ability to\r\nresent injuries and redress wrongs that we may avoid them.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners under the 5th article of the treaty of Ghent, having\r\ndisagreed in their opinions respecting that portion of the boundary between\r\nthe Territories of the United States and of Great Britain the establishment\r\nof which had been submitted to them, have made their respective reports in\r\ncompliance with that article, that the same might be referred to the\r\ndecision of a friendly power. It being manifest, however, that it would be\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, for any power to perform that office without\r\ngreat delay and much inconvenience to itself, a proposal has been made by\r\nthis Government, and acceded to by that of Great Britain, to endeavor to\r\nestablish that boundary by amicable negotiation.\r\n\r\nIt appearing from long experience that no satisfactory arrangement could be\r\nformed of the commercial intercourse between the United States and the\r\nBritish colonies in this hemisphere by legislative acts while each party\r\npursued its own course without agreement or concert with the other, a\r\nproposal has been made to the British Government to regulate this commerce\r\nby treaty, as it has been to arrange in like manner the just claim of the\r\ncitizens of the United States inhabiting the States and Territories\r\nbordering on the lakes and rivers which empty into the St. Lawrence to the\r\nnavigation of that river to the ocean. For these and other objects of high\r\nimportance to the interests of both parties a negotiation has been opened\r\nwith the British Government which it is hoped will have a satisfactory\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners under the 6th and 7th articles of the treaty of Ghent\r\nhaving successfully closed their labors in relation to the 6th, have\r\nproceeded to the discharge of those relating to the 7th. Their progress in\r\nthe extensive survey required for the performance of their duties justifies\r\nthe presumption that it will be completed in the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation which had been long depending with the French Government on\r\nseveral important subjects, and particularly for a just indemnity for\r\nlosses sustained in the late wars by the citizens of the United States\r\nunder unjustifiable seizures and confiscations of their property, has not\r\nas yet had the desired effect. As this claim rests on the same principle\r\nwith others which have been admitted by the French Government, it is not\r\nperceived on what just ground it can be rejected. A minister will be\r\nimmediately appointed to proceed to France and resume the negotiation on\r\nthis and other subjects which may arise between the two nations.\r\n\r\nAt the proposal of the Russian Imperial Government, made through the\r\nminister of the Emperor residing here, a full power and instructions have\r\nbeen transmitted to the minister of the United States at St. Petersburg to\r\narrange by amicable negotiation the respective rights and interests of the\r\ntwo nations on the North West coast of this continent. A similar proposal\r\nhad been made by His Imperial Majesty to the Government of Great Britain,\r\nwhich has likewise been acceded to. The Government of the United States has\r\nbeen desirous by this friendly proceeding of manifesting the great value\r\nwhich they have invariably attached to the friendship of the Emperor and\r\ntheir solicitude to cultivate the best understanding with his Government.\r\nIn the discussions to which this interest has given rise and in the\r\narrangements by which they may terminate the occasion has been judged\r\nproper for asserting, as a principle in which the rights and interests of\r\nthe United States are involved, that the American continents, by the free\r\nand independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are\r\nhenceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any\r\nEuropean powers.\r\n\r\nSince the close of the last session of Congress the commissioners and\r\narbitrators for ascertaining and determining the amount of indemnification\r\nwhich may be due to citizens of the United States under the decision of His\r\nImperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia, in conformity to the convention\r\nconcluded at St. Petersburg on July 12th, 1822, have assembled in this\r\ncity, and organized themselves as a board for the performance of the\r\nduties assigned to them by that treaty. The commission constituted under\r\nthe 11th article of the treaty of February 22nd, 1819, between the United\r\nStates and Spain is also in session here, and as the term of three years\r\nlimited by the treaty for the execution of the trust will expire before\r\nthe period of the next regular meeting of Congress, the attention of the\r\nLegislature will be drawn to the measures which may be necessary to\r\naccomplish the objects for which the commission was instituted.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives adopted at\r\ntheir last session, instructions have been given to all the ministers of\r\nthe United States accredited to the powers of Europe and America to propose\r\nthe proscription of the African slave trade by classing it under the\r\ndenomination, and inflicting on its perpetrators the punishment, of piracy.\r\nShould this proposal be acceded to, it is not doubted that this odious and\r\ncriminal practice will be promptly and entirely suppressed. It is earnestly\r\nhoped that it will be acceded to, from the firm belief that it is the most\r\neffectual expedient that can be adopted for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the recent war between France and Spain it was\r\ndeclared by the French Government that it would grant no commissions to\r\nprivateers, and that neither the commerce of Spain herself nor of neutral\r\nnations should be molested by the naval force of France, except in the\r\nbreach of a lawful blockade. This declaration, which appears to have been\r\nfaithfully carried into effect, concurring with principles proclaimed and\r\ncherished by the United States from the first establishment of their\r\nindependence, suggested the hope that the time had arrived when the\r\nproposal for adopting it as a permanent and invariable rule in all future\r\nmaritime wars might meet the favorable consideration of the great European\r\npowers. Instructions have accordingly been given to our ministers with\r\nFrance, Russia, and Great Britain to make those proposals to their\r\nrespective Governments, and when the friends of humanity reflect on the\r\nessential amelioration to the condition of the human race which would\r\nresult from the abolition of private war on the sea and on the great\r\nfacility by which it might be accomplished, requiring only the consent of a\r\nfew sovereigns, an earnest hope is indulged that these overtures will meet\r\nwith an attention animated by the spirit in which they were made, and that\r\nthey will ultimately be successful.\r\n\r\nThe ministers who were appointed to the Republics of Colombia and Buenos\r\nAyres during the last session of Congress proceeded shortly afterwards to\r\ntheir destinations. Of their arrival there official intelligence has not\r\nyet been received. The minister appointed to the Republic of Chile will\r\nsail in a few days. An early appointment will also be made to Mexico. A\r\nminister has been received from Colombia, and the other Governments have\r\nbeen informed that ministers, or diplomatic agents of inferior grade, would\r\nbe received from each, accordingly as they might prefer the one or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe minister appointed to Spain proceeded soon after his appointment for\r\nCadiz, the residence of the Sovereign to whom he was accredited. In\r\napproaching that port the frigate which conveyed him was warned off by the\r\ncommander of the French squadron by which it was blockaded and not\r\npermitted to enter, although apprised by the captain of the frigate of the\r\npublic character of the person whom he had on board, the landing of whom\r\nwas the sole object of his proposed entry. This act, being considered an\r\ninfringement of the rights of ambassadors and of nations, will form a just\r\ncause of complaint to the Government of France against the officer by whom\r\nit was committed.\r\n\r\nThe actual condition of the public finances more than realizes the\r\nfavorable anticipations that were entertained of it at the opening of the\r\nlast session of Congress. On the first of January there was a balance in\r\nthe Treasury of $4,237,427.55. From that time to the 30th of September the\r\nreceipts amounted to upward of $16.1 millions, and the expenditures to\r\n$11.4 millions. During the 4th quarter of the year it is estimated that\r\nthe receipts will at least equal the expenditures, and that there will\r\nremain in the Treasury on the first day of January next a surplus of\r\nnearly $9 millions.\r\n\r\nOn January 1st, 1825, a large amount of the war debt and a part of the\r\nRevolutionary debt become redeemable. Additional portions of the former\r\nwill continue to become redeemable annually until the year 1835. it is\r\nbelieved, however, that if the United States remain at peace the whole of\r\nthat debt may be redeemed by the ordinary revenue of those years during\r\nthat period under the provision of the act of March 3rd, 1817, creating the\r\nsinking fund, and in that case the only part of the debt that will remain\r\nafter the year 1835 will be the $7 millions of 5% stock subscribed to the\r\nBank of the United States, and the 3% Revolutionary debt, amounting to\r\n$13,296,099.06, both of which are redeemable at the pleasure of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Army in its organization and discipline has been gradually\r\nimproving for several years, and has now attained a high degree of\r\nperfection. The military disbursements have been regularly made and the\r\naccounts regularly and promptly rendered for settlement. The supplies of\r\nvarious descriptions have been of good quality, and regularly issued at all\r\nof the posts. A system of economy and accountability has been introduced\r\ninto every branch of the service which admits of little additional\r\nimprovement. This desirable state has been attained by the act reorganizing\r\nthe staff of the Army, passed on April 14th, 1818.\r\n\r\nThe moneys appropriated for fortifications have been regularly and\r\neconomically applied, and all the works advanced as rapidly as the amount\r\nappropriated would admit. Three important works will be completed in the\r\ncourse of this year--that is, Fort Washington, Fort Delaware, and the\r\nfort at the Rigolets, in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Engineers and the Topographical Corps have been in constant\r\nand active service in surveying the coast and projecting the works\r\nnecessary for its defense.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy has attained a degree of perfection in its discipline\r\nand instruction equal, as is believed, to any institution of its kind in\r\nany country.\r\n\r\nThe money appropriated for the use of the Ordnance Department has been\r\nregularly and economically applied. The fabrication of arms at the national\r\narmories and by contract with the Department has been gradually improving\r\nin quality and cheapness. It is believed that their quality is now such as\r\nto admit of but little improvement.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the fortifications renders it necessary that there should\r\nbe a suitable appropriation for the purpose of fabricating the cannon and\r\ncarriages necessary for those works.\r\n\r\nUnder the appropriation of $5,000 for exploring the Western waters for the\r\nlocation of a site for a Western armory, a commission was constituted,\r\nconsisting of Colonel McRee, Colonel Lee, and Captain Talcott, who have\r\nbeen engaged in exploring the country. They have not yet reported the\r\nresult of their labors, but it is believed that they will be prepared to do\r\nit at an early part of the session of Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of June last General Ashley and his party, who were\r\ntrading under a license from the Government, were attacked by the Ricarees\r\nwhile peaceably trading with the Indians at their request. Several of the\r\nparty were killed and wounded and their property taken or destroyed.\r\n\r\nColonel Leavenworth, who commanded Fort Atkinson, at the Council Bluffs,\r\nthe most western post, apprehending that the hostile spirit of the Ricarees\r\nwould extend to other tribes in that quarter, and that thereby the lives of\r\nthe traders on the Missouri and the peace of the frontier would be\r\nendangered, took immediate measures to check the evil.\r\n\r\nWith a detachment of the regiment stationed at the Bluffs he successfully\r\nattacked the Ricaree village, and it is hoped that such an impression has\r\nbeen made on them as well as on the other tribes on the Missouri as will\r\nprevent a recurrence of future hostility.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War, which is herewith transmitted, will\r\nexhibit in greater detail the condition of the Department in its various\r\nbranches, and the progress which has been made in its administration during\r\nthe three first quarters of the year.\r\n\r\nI transmit a return of the militia of the several States according to the\r\nlast reports which have been made by the proper officers in each to the\r\nDepartment of War. By reference to this return it will be seen that it is\r\nnot complete, although great exertions have been made to make it so. As the\r\ndefense and even the liberties of the country must depend in times of\r\nimminent danger on the militia, it is of the highest importance that it be\r\nwell organized, armed, and disciplined throughout the Union.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shews the progress made during the three\r\nfirst quarters of the present year by the application of the fund\r\nappropriated for arming the militia. Much difficulty is found in\r\ndistributing the arms according to the act of Congress providing for it\r\nfrom the failure of the proper departments in many of the States to make\r\nregular returns. The act of May 12, 1820 provides that the system of\r\ntactics and regulations of the various corps of the Regular Army shall be\r\nextended to the militia. This act has been very imperfectly executed from\r\nthe want of uniformity in the organization of the militia, proceeding from\r\nthe defects of the system itself, and especially in its application to that\r\nmain arm of the public defense. It is thought that this important subject\r\nin all its branches merits the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy, which is now communicated,\r\nfurnishes an account of the administration of that Department for the three\r\nfirst quarters of the present year, with the progress made in augmenting\r\nthe Navy, and the manner in which the vessels in commission have been\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe usual force has been maintained in the Mediterranean Sea, the Pacific\r\nOcean, and along the Atlantic coast, and has afforded the necessary\r\nprotection to our commerce in those seas.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico our naval force has been\r\naugmented by the addition of several small vessels provided for by the \"act\r\nauthorizing an additional naval force for the suppression of piracy\",\r\npassed by Congress at their last session. That armament has been eminently\r\nsuccessful in the accomplishment of its object. The piracies by which our\r\ncommerce in the neighborhood of the island of Cuba had been afflicted have\r\nbeen repressed and the confidence of our merchants in a great measure\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic zeal and enterprise of Commodore Porter, to whom the command\r\nof the expedition was confided, has been fully seconded by the officers and\r\nmen under his command. And in reflecting with high satisfaction on the\r\nhonorable manner in which they have sustained the reputation of their\r\ncountry and its Navy, the sentiment is alloyed only by a concern that in\r\nthe fulfillment of that arduous service the diseases incident to the season\r\nand to the climate in which it was discharged have deprived the nation of\r\nmany useful lives, and among them of several officers of great promise.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August a very malignant fever made its appearance at\r\nThompsons Island, which threatened the destruction of our station there.\r\nMany perished, and the commanding officer was severely attacked. Uncertain\r\nas to his fate and knowing that most of the medical officers had been\r\nrendered incapable of discharging their duties, it was thought expedient to\r\nsend to that post an officer of rank and experience, with several skilled\r\nsurgeons, to ascertain the origin of the fever and the probability of its\r\nrecurrence there in future seasons; to furnish every assistance to those\r\nwho were suffering, and, if practicable, to avoid the necessity of\r\nabandoning so important a station. Commodore Rodgers, with a promptitude\r\nwhich did him honor, cheerfully accepted that trust, and has discharged it\r\nin the manner anticipated from his skill and patriotism. Before his arrival\r\nCommodore Porter, with the greater part of the squadron, had removed from\r\nthe island and returned to the United States in consequence of the\r\nprevailing sickness. Much useful information has, however, been obtained as\r\nto the state of the island and great relief afforded to those who had been\r\nnecessarily left there.\r\n\r\nAlthough our expedition, cooperating with an invigorated administration of\r\nthe government of the island of Cuba, and with the corresponding active\r\nexertions of a British naval force in the same seas, have almost entirely\r\ndestroyed the unlicensed piracies from that island, the success of our\r\nexertions has not been equally effectual to suppress the same crime, under\r\nother pretenses and colors, in the neighboring island of Porto Rico. They\r\nhave been committed there under the abusive issue of Spanish commissions.\r\n\r\nAt an early period of the present year remonstrances were made to the\r\ngovernor of that island, by an agent who was sent for the purpose, against\r\nthose outrages on the peaceful commerce of the United States, of which many\r\nhad occurred. That officer, professing his own want of authority to make\r\nsatisfaction for our just complaints, answered only by a reference of them\r\nto the Government of Spain. The minister of the United States to that court\r\nwas specially instructed to urge the necessity of immediate and effectual\r\ninterposition of that Government, directing restitution and indemnity for\r\nwrongs already committed and interdicting the repetition of them. The\r\nminister, as has been seen, was debarred access to the Spanish Government,\r\nand in the mean time several new cases of flagrant outrage have occurred,\r\nand citizens of the United States in the island of Porto Rico have\r\nsuffered, and others been threatened with assassination for asserting their\r\nunquestionable rights even before the lawful tribunals of the country.\r\n\r\nThe usual orders have been given to all our public ships to seize American\r\nvessels in the slave trade and bring them in for adjudication, and I have\r\nthe gratification to state that not one so employed has been discovered,\r\nand there is good reason to believe that our flag is now seldom, if at all,\r\ndisgraced by that traffic.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of great satisfaction that we are always enabled to recur to\r\nthe conduct of our Navy with price and commendation. As a means of national\r\ndefense it enjoys the public confidence, and is steadily assuming\r\nadditional importance. It is submitted whether a more efficient and equally\r\neconomical organization of it might not in several respects be effected. It\r\nis supposed that higher grades than now exist by law would be useful. They\r\nwould afford well-merited rewards to those who have long and faithfully\r\nserved their country, present the best incentives to good conduct, and the\r\nbest means of insuring a proper discipline; destroy the inequality in that\r\nrespect between military and naval services, and relieve our officers from\r\nmany inconveniences and mortifications which occur when our vessels meet\r\nthose of other nations, ours being the only service in which such grades do\r\nnot exist.\r\n\r\nA report of the Post Master-General, which accompanies this communication,\r\nwill shew the present state of the Post-Office Department and its general\r\noperations for some years past.\r\n\r\nThere is established by law 88,600 miles of post roads, on which the mail\r\nis now transported 85,700 miles, and contracts have been made for its\r\ntransportation on all the established routes, with one or two exceptions.\r\nThere are 5,240 post offices in the Union, and as many post masters. The\r\ngross amount of postage which accrued from July 1st, 1822 to July 1st,\r\n1823 was $1,114,345.12. During the same period the expenditures of the\r\nPost-Office Department amounted to $1,169,885.51 and consisted of the\r\nfollowing items, viz: Compensation to post masters, $353,995.98;\r\nincidental expenses, $30,866.37; transportation of the mail, $784,600.08;\r\npayments into the Treasury, $423.08. On the first of July last there was\r\ndue to the Department from post masters $135,245.28; from late post\r\nmasters and contractors, $256,749.31; making a total amount of balances\r\ndue to the Department of $391,994.59.\r\n\r\nThese balances embrace all delinquencies of post masters and contractors\r\nwhich have taken place since the organization of the Department. There was\r\ndue by the Department to contractors on the first of July last $26,548.64.\r\n\r\nThe transportation of the mail within five years past has been greatly\r\nextended, and the expenditures of the Department proportionably increased.\r\nAlthough the postage which has accrued within the last three years has\r\nfallen short of the expenditures $262,821.46, it appears that collections\r\nhave been made from the outstanding balances to meet the principal part of\r\nthe current demands.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that not more than $250,000 of the above balances can be\r\ncollected, and that a considerable part of this sum can only be realized by\r\na resort to legal process. Some improvements in the receipts for postage is\r\nexpected. A prompt attention to the collection of moneys received by post\r\nmasters, it is believed, will enable the Department to continue its\r\noperations without aid from the Treasury, unless the expenditures shall be\r\nincreased by the establishment of new mail routes.\r\n\r\nA revision of some parts of the post office law may be necessary; and it is\r\nsubmitted whether it would not be proper to provide for the appointment of\r\npost masters, where the compensation exceeds a certain amount, by\r\nnomination to the Senate, as other officers of the General Government are\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nHaving communicated my views to Congress at the commencement of the last\r\nsession respecting the encouragement which ought to be given to our\r\nmanufactures and the principle on which it should be founded, I have only\r\nto add that those views remain unchanged, and that the present state of\r\nthose countries with which we have the most immediate political relations\r\nand greatest commercial intercourse tends to confirm them. Under this\r\nimpression I recommend a review of the tariff for the purpose of affording\r\nsuch additional protection to those articles which we are prepared to\r\nmanufacture, or which are more immediately connected with the defense and\r\nindependence of the country.\r\n\r\nThe actual state of the public accounts furnishes additional evidence of\r\nthe efficiency of the present system of accountability in relation to the\r\npublic expenditure. Of the moneys drawn from the Treasury since\r\nMarch 4th, 1817, the sum remaining unaccounted for on the 30th of September\r\nlast is more than $1.5 millions less than on the 30th of September\r\npreceding; and during the same period a reduction of nearly $1 million\r\nhas been made in the amount of the unsettled accounts for moneys advanced\r\npreviously to March 4th, 1817. It will be obvious that in proportion as\r\nthe mass of accounts of the latter description is diminished by settlement\r\nthe difficulty of settling the residue is increased from the consideration\r\nthat in many instances it can be obtained only by legal process. For more\r\nprecise details on this subject I refer to a report from the first\r\nComptroller of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe sum which was appropriated at the last session for the repairs of the\r\nCumberland road has been applied with good effect to that object. A final\r\nreport has not been received from the agent who was appointed to\r\nsuperintend it. As soon as it is received it shall be communicated to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nMany patriotic and enlightened citizens who have made the subject an object\r\nof particular investigation have suggested an improvement of still greater\r\nimportance. They are of the opinion that the waters of the Chesapeake and\r\nOhio may be connected together by one continued canal, and at an expense\r\nfar short of the value and importance of the object to be obtained. If this\r\ncould be accomplished it is impossible to calculate the beneficial\r\nconsequences which would result from it.\r\n\r\nA great portion of the produce of the very fertile country through which it\r\nwould pass would find a market through that channel. Troops might be moved\r\nwith great facility in war, with cannon and every kind of munition, and in\r\neither direction. Connecting the Atlantic with the Western country in a\r\nline passing through the seat of the National Government, it would\r\ncontribute essentially to strengthen the bond of union itself.\r\n\r\nBelieving as I do that Congress possess the right to appropriate money for\r\nsuch a national object (the jurisdiction remaining to the States through\r\nwhich the canal would pass), I submit it to your consideration whether it\r\nmay not be advisable to authorize by an adequate appropriation the\r\nemployment of a suitable number of the officers of the Corps of Engineers\r\nto examine the unexplored ground during the next season and to report their\r\nopinion thereon. It will likewise be proper to extend their examination to\r\nthe several routes through which the waters of the Ohio may be connected by\r\ncanals with those of Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nAs the Cumberland road will require annual repairs, and Congress have not\r\nthought it expedient to recommend to the States an amendment to the\r\nConstitution for the purpose of vesting in the United States a power to\r\nadopt and execute a system of internal improvement, it is also submitted to\r\nyour consideration whether it may not be expedient to authorize the\r\nExecutive to enter into an arrangement with the several States through\r\nwhich the road passes to establish tolls, each within its limits, for the\r\npurpose of defraying the expense of future repairs and of providing also by\r\nsuitable penalties for its protection against future injuries.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of May 7th, 1822, appropriated the sum of $22,700 for\r\nthe purpose of erecting two piers as a shelter for vessels from ice near\r\nCape Henlopen, Delaware Bay. To effect the object of the act the officers\r\nof the Board of Engineers, with Commodore Bainbridge, were directed to\r\nprepare plans and estimates of piers sufficient to answer the purpose\r\nintended by the act. It appears by their report, which accompanies the\r\ndocuments from the War Department, that the appropriation is not adequate\r\nto the purpose intended; and as the piers would be of great service both to\r\nthe navigation of the Delaware Bay and the protection of vessels on the\r\nadjacent parts of the coast, I submit for the consideration of Congress\r\nwhether additional and sufficient appropriations should not be made.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Engineers were also directed to examine and survey the\r\nentrance of the harbor of the port of Presqu'isle, in Pennsylvania, in\r\norder to make an estimate of the expense of removing the obstructions\r\nto the entrance, with a plan of the best mode of effecting the same, under\r\nthe appropriation for that purpose by act of Congress passed 3rd of March\r\nlast. The report of the Board accompanies the papers from the War\r\nDepartment, and is submitted for the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nA strong hope has been long entertained, founded on the heroic struggle of\r\nthe Greeks, that they would succeed in their contest and resume their equal\r\nstation among the nations of the earth. It is believed that the whole\r\ncivilized world take a deep interest in their welfare. Although no power\r\nhas declared in their favor, yet none according to our information, has\r\ntaken part against them. Their cause and their name have protected them\r\nfrom dangers which might ere this have overwhelmed any other people. The\r\nordinary calculations of interest and of acquisition with a view to\r\naggrandizement, which mingles so much in the transactions of nations, seem\r\nto have had no effect in regard to them. From the facts which have come to\r\nour knowledge there is good cause to believe that their enemy has lost\r\nforever all dominion over them; that Greece will become again an\r\nindependent nation. That she may obtain that rank is the object of our most\r\nardent wishes.\r\n\r\nIt was stated at the commencement of the last session that a great effort\r\nwas then making in Spain and Portugal to improve the condition of the\r\npeople of those countries, and that it appeared to be conducted with\r\nextraordinary moderation. It need scarcely be remarked that the result has\r\nbeen so far very different from what was then anticipated. Of events in\r\nthat quarter of the globe, with which we have so much intercourse and from\r\nwhich we derive our origin, we have always been anxious and interested\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of the United States cherish sentiments the most friendly in\r\nfavor of the liberty and happiness of their fellow men on that side of the\r\nAtlantic. In the wars of the European powers in matters relating to\r\nthemselves we have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our\r\npolicy so to do.\r\n\r\nIt is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent\r\ninjuries or make preparation for our defense. With the movements in this\r\nhemisphere we are of necessity more immediately connected, and by causes\r\nwhich must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers.\r\n\r\nThe political system of the allied powers is essentially different in this\r\nrespect from that of America. This difference proceeds from that which\r\nexists in their respective Governments; and to the defense of our own,\r\nwhich has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure, and\r\nmatured by the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens, and under which\r\nwe have enjoyed unexampled felicity, this whole nation is devoted.\r\n\r\nWe owe it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing\r\nbetween the United States and those powers to declare that we should\r\nconsider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of\r\nthis hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. With the existing\r\ncolonies or dependencies of any European power we have not interfered and\r\nshall not interfere, but with the Governments who have declared their\r\nindependence and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great\r\nconsideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could not view any\r\ninterposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any\r\nother manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than\r\nas the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn the war between those new Governments and Spain we declared our\r\nneutrality at the time of their recognition, and to this we have adhered,\r\nand shall continue to adhere, provided no change shall occur which, in the\r\njudgment of the competent authorities of this Government, shall make a\r\ncorresponding change on the part of the United States indispensable to\r\ntheir security.\r\n\r\nThe late events in Spain and Portugal shew that Europe is still unsettled.\r\nOf this important fact no stronger proof can be adduced than that the\r\nallied powers should have thought it proper, on any principle satisfactory\r\nto themselves, to have interposed by force in the internal concerns of\r\nSpain. To what extent such interposition may be carried, on the same\r\nprinciple, is a question in which all independent powers whose governments\r\ndiffer from theirs are interested, even those most remote, and surely none\r\nmore so than the United States.\r\n\r\nOur policy in regard to Europe, which was adopted at an early stage of the\r\nwars which have so long agitated that quarter of the globe, nevertheless\r\nremains the same, which is, not to interfere in the internal concerns of\r\nany of its powers; to consider the government de facto as the legitimate\r\ngovernment for us; to cultivate friendly relations with it, and to preserve\r\nthose relations by a frank, firm, and manly policy, meeting in all\r\ninstances the just claims of every power, submitting to injuries from\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nBut in regard to those continents circumstances are eminently and\r\nconspicuously different. It is impossible that the allied powers should\r\nextend their political system to any portion of either continent without\r\nendangering our peace and happiness; nor can anyone believe that our\r\nsouthern brethren, if left to themselves, would adopt it of their own\r\naccord. It is equally impossible, therefore, that we should behold such\r\ninterposition in any form with indifference. If we look to the comparative\r\nstrength and resources of Spain and those new Governments, and their\r\ndistance from each other, it must be obvious that she can never subdue\r\nthem. It is still the true policy of the United States to leave the parties\r\nto themselves, in the hope that other powers will pursue the same course.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the present condition of our Union with its actual state at\r\nthe close of our Revolution, the history of the world furnishes no example\r\nof a progress in improvement in all the important circumstances which\r\nconstitute the happiness of a nation which bears any resemblance to it. At\r\nthe first epoch our population did not exceed 3,000,000. By the last census\r\nit amounted to about 10,000,000, and, what is more extraordinary, it is\r\nalmost altogether native, for the immigration from other countries has been\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\nAt the first epoch half the territory within our acknowledged limits was\r\nuninhabited and a wilderness. Since then new territory has been acquired of\r\nvast extent, comprising within it many rivers, particularly the\r\nMississippi, the navigation of which to the ocean was of the highest\r\nimportance to the original States. Over this territory our population has\r\nexpanded in every direction, and new States have been established almost\r\nequal in number to those which formed the first bond of our Union. This\r\nexpansion of our population and accession of new States to our Union have\r\nhad the happiest effect on all its highest interests.\r\n\r\nThat it has eminently augmented our resources and added to our strength and\r\nrespectability as a power is admitted by all, but it is not in these\r\nimportant circumstances only that this happy effect is felt. It is manifest\r\nthat by enlarging the basis of our system and increasing the number of\r\nStates the system itself has been greatly strengthened in both its\r\nbranches. Consolidation and disunion have thereby been rendered equally\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nEach Government, confiding in its own strength, has less to apprehend from\r\nthe other, and in consequence each, enjoying a greater freedom of action,\r\nis rendered more efficient for all the purposes for which it was\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to treat here of the vast improvement made in the system\r\nitself by the adoption of this Constitution and of its happy effect in\r\nelevating the character and in protecting the rights of the nation as well\r\nas individuals. To what, then, do we owe these blessings? It is known to\r\nall that we derive them from the excellence of our institutions. Ought we\r\nnot, then, to adopt every measure which may be necessary to perpetuate\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nJames Monroe\r\nDecember 7, 1824\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe view which I have now to present to you of our affairs, foreign and\r\ndomestic, realizes the most sanguine anticipations which have been\r\nentertained of the public prosperity. If we look to the whole, our growth\r\nas a nation continues to be rapid beyond example; if to the States which\r\ncompose it, the same gratifying spectacle is exhibited. Our expansion over\r\nthe vast territory within our limits has been great, without indicating any\r\ndecline in those sections from which the emigration has been most\r\nconspicuous. We have daily gained strength by a native population in every\r\nquarter--a population devoted to our happy system of government and\r\ncherishing the bond of union with internal affection.\r\n\r\nExperience has already shewn that the difference of climate and of\r\nindustry, proceeding from that cause, inseparable from such vast domains,\r\nand which under other systems might have a repulsive tendency, can not fail\r\nto produce with us under wise regulations the opposite effect. What one\r\nportion wants the other may supply; and this will be most sensibly felt by\r\nthe parts most distant from each other, forming thereby a domestic market\r\nand an active intercourse between the extremes and throughout every portion\r\nof our Union.\r\n\r\nThus by a happy distribution of power between the National and State\r\nGovernments, Governments which rest exclusively on the sovereignty of the\r\npeople and are fully adequate to the great purposes for which they were\r\nrespectively instituted, causes which might otherwise lead to dismemberment\r\noperate powerfully to draw us closer together.\r\n\r\nIn every other circumstance a correct view of the actual state of our Union\r\nmust be equally gratifying to our constituents. Our relations with foreign\r\npowers are of a friendly character, although certain interesting\r\ndifferences remain unsettled with some. Our revenue under the mild system\r\nof impost and tonnage continues to be adequate to all the purposes of the\r\nGovernment. Our agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and navigation\r\nflourish. Our fortifications are advancing in the degree authorized by\r\nexisting appropriations to maturity, and due progress is made in the\r\naugmentation of the Navy to the limit prescribed for it by law. For these\r\nblessings we owe to Almighty God, from whom we derive them, and with\r\nprofound reverence, our most grateful and unceasing acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nIn adverting to our relations with foreign powers, which are always an\r\nobject of the highest importance, I have to remark that of the subjects\r\nwhich have been brought into discussion with them during the present\r\nAdministration some have been satisfactorily terminated, others have been\r\nsuspended, to be resumed hereafter under circumstances more favorable to\r\nsuccess, and others are still in negotiation, with the hope that they may\r\nbe adjusted with mutual accommodation to the interests and to the\r\nsatisfaction of the respective parties. It has been the invariable object\r\nof this Government to cherish the most friendly relations with every power,\r\nand on principles and conditions which might make them permanent. A\r\nsystematic effort has been made to place our commerce with each power on a\r\nfooting of perfect reciprocity, to settle with each in a spirit of candor\r\nand liberality all existing differences, and to anticipate and remove so\r\nfar as it might be practicable all causes of future variance.\r\n\r\nIt having been stipulated by the 7th article of the convention of\r\nnavigation and commerce which was concluded on June 24th, 1822, between the\r\nUnited States and France, that the said convention should continue in force\r\nfor two years from the first of October of that year, and for an indefinite\r\nterm afterwards, unless one of the parties should declare its intention to\r\nrenounce it, in which event it should cease to operate at the end of six\r\nmonths from such declaration, and no such intention having been announced,\r\nthe convention having been found advantageous to both parties, it has since\r\nremained, and still remains, in force.\r\n\r\nAt the time when that convention was concluded many interesting subjects\r\nwere left unsettled, and particularly our claim to indemnity for\r\nspoliations which were committed on our commerce in the late wars. For\r\nthese interests and claims it was in the contemplation of the parties to\r\nmake provision at a subsequent day by a more comprehensive and definitive\r\ntreaty. The object has been duly attended to since by the Executive, but as\r\nyet it has not been accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that a favorable opportunity will present itself for opening a\r\nnegotiation which may embrace and arrange all existing differences and\r\nevery other concern in which they have a common interest upon the accession\r\nof the present King of France, an event which has occurred since the close\r\nof the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nWith Great Britain our commercial intercourse rests on the same footing\r\nthat it did at the last session. By the convention of 1815, the commerce\r\nbetween the United States and the British dominions in Europe and the East\r\nIndies was arranged on a principle of reciprocity. That convention was\r\nconfirmed and continued in force, with slight exceptions, by a subsequent\r\ntreaty for the term of ten years from October 20th, 1818, the date of\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nThe trade with the British colonies in the West Indies has not as yet been\r\narranged, by treaty or otherwise, to our satisfaction. An approach to that\r\nresult has been made by legislative acts, whereby many serious impediments\r\nwhich had been raised by the parties in defense of their respective claims\r\nwere removed. An earnest desire exists, and has been manifested on the part\r\nof this Government, to place the commerce with the colonies, likewise, on a\r\nfooting of reciprocal advantage, and it is hoped that the British\r\nGovernment, seeing the justice of the proposal and its importance to the\r\ncolonies, will ere long accede to it.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners who were appointed for the adjustment of the boundary\r\nbetween the territories of the United States and those of Great Britain,\r\nspecified in the 5th article of the treaty of Ghent, having disagreed in\r\ntheir decision, and both Governments having agreed to establish that\r\nboundary by amicable negotiation between them, it is hoped that it may be\r\nsatisfactorily adjusted in that mode. The boundary specified by the 6th\r\narticle has been established by the decision of the commissioners. From the\r\nprogress made in that provided for by the 7th, according to a report\r\nrecently received, there is good cause to presume that it will be settled\r\nin the course of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nIt is a cause of serious regret that no arrangement has yet been finally\r\nconcluded between the two Governments to secure by joint cooperation the\r\nsuppression of the slave trade. It was the object of the British Government\r\nin the early stages of the negotiation to adopt a plan for the suppression\r\nwhich should include the concession of the mutual right of search by the\r\nships of war of each party of the vessels of the other for suspected\r\noffenders. This was objected to by this Government on the principle that as\r\nthe right of search was a right of war of a belligerent toward a neutral\r\npower it might have an ill effect to extend it by treaty, to an offense\r\nwhich had been made comparatively mild, to a time of peace.\r\n\r\nAnxious, however, for the suppression of this trade, it was thought\r\nadvisable, in compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives,\r\nfounded on an act of Congress, to propose to the British Government an\r\nexpedient which should be free from that objection and more effectual for\r\nthe object, by making it piratical. In that mode the enormity of the crime\r\nwould place the offenders out of the protection of their Government, and\r\ninvolve no question of search or other question between the parties\r\ntouching their respective rights. It was believed, also, that it would\r\ncompletely suppress the trade in the vessels of both parties, and by their\r\nrespective citizens and subjects in those of other powers, with whom it was\r\nhoped that the odium which would thereby be attached to it would produce a\r\ncorresponding arrangement, and by means thereof its entire extirpation\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nA convention to this effect was concluded and signed in London on\r\nMarch 13th, 1824, by plenipotentiaries duly authorized by both\r\nGovernments, to the ratification of which certain obstacles have arisen\r\nwhich are not yet entirely removed. The difference between the parties\r\nstill remaining has been reduced to a point not of sufficient magnitude,\r\nas is presumed, to be permitted to defeat an object so near to the heart\r\nof both nations and so desirable to the friends of humanity throughout\r\nthe world. As objections, however, to the principle recommended by the\r\nHouse of Representatives, or at least to the consequences inseparable\r\nfrom it, and which are understood to apply to the law, have been raised,\r\nwhich may deserve a reconsideration of the whole subject, I have thought\r\nit proper to suspend the conclusion of a new convention until the\r\ndefinitive sentiments of Congress may be ascertained. The documents\r\nrelating to the negotiation are with that intent submitted to your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nOur commerce with Sweden has been placed on a footing of perfect\r\nreciprocity by treaty, and with Russia, the Netherlands, Prussia, the free\r\nHanseatic cities, the Dukedom of Oldenburg, and Sardinia by internal\r\nregulations on each side, founded on mutual agreement between the\r\nrespective Governments.\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which the commercial policy of the United States is\r\nfounded are to be traced to an early period. They are essentially connected\r\nwith those upon which their independence was declared, and owe their origin\r\nto the enlightened men who took the lead in our affairs at that important\r\nepoch. They are developed in their first treaty of commerce with France of\r\nFebruary 6th, 1778, and by a formal commission which was instituted\r\nImmediately after the conclusion of their Revolutionary struggle, for the\r\npurpose of negotiating treaties of commerce with every European power. The\r\nfirst treaty of the United States with Prussia, which was negotiated by\r\nthat commission, affords a signal illustration of those principles. The act\r\nof Congress of March 3rd, 1815, adopted immediately after the return of a\r\ngeneral peace, was a new overture to foreign nations to establish our\r\ncommercial relations with them on the basis of free and equal reciprocity.\r\nThat principle has pervaded all the acts of Congress and all the\r\nnegotiations of the Executive on the subject.\r\n\r\nA convention for the settlement of important questions in relation to the\r\nNorth West coast of this continent and its adjoining seas was concluded and\r\nsigned at St. Petersburg on the 5th day of April last by the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States and plenipotentiaries of the Imperial\r\nGovernment of Russia. It will immediately be laid before the Senate for the\r\nexercise of the constitutional authority of that body with reference to its\r\nratification. It is proper to add that the manner in which this negotiation\r\nwas invited and conducted on the part of the Emperor has been very\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe great and extraordinary changes which have happened in the Governments\r\nof Spain and Portugal within the last two years, without seriously\r\naffecting the friendly relations which under all of them have been\r\nmaintained with those powers by the United States, have been obstacles to\r\nthe adjustment of the particular subjects of discussion which have arisen\r\nwith each. A resolution of the Senate adopted at their last session called\r\nfor information as to the effect produced upon our relations with Spain by\r\nthe recognition on the part of the United States of the independent South\r\nAmerican Governments. The papers containing that information are now\r\ncommunicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nA charge d'affaires has been received from the independent Government of\r\nBrazil. That country, heretofore a colonial possession of Portugal, had\r\nsome years since been proclaimed by the Sovereign of Portugal himself an\r\nindependent Kingdom. Since his return to Lisbon a revolution in Brazil has\r\nestablished a new Government there with an imperial title, at the head of\r\nwhich is placed a prince, in whom the regency had been vested by the King\r\nat the time of his departure. There is reason to expect that by amicable\r\nnegotiation the independence of Brazil will ere long be recognized by\r\nPortugal herself.\r\n\r\nWith the remaining powers of Europe, with those on the coast of Barbary,\r\nand with all the new South American States our relations are of a friendly\r\ncharacter. We have ministers plenipotentiary residing with the Republics of\r\nColombia and Chile, and have received ministers of the same rank from\r\nColumbia, Guatemala, Buenos Ayres, and Mexico. Our commercial relations\r\nwith all those States are mutually beneficial and increasing. With the\r\nRepublic of Colombia a treaty of commerce has been formed, of which a copy\r\nis received and the original daily expected. A negotiation for a like\r\ntreaty would have been commenced with Buenos Ayres had it not been\r\nprevented by the indisposition and lamented decease of Mr. Rodney, our\r\nminister there, and to whose memory the most respectful attention has been\r\nshewn by the Government of that Republic. An advantageous alteration in our\r\ntreaty with Tunis has been obtained by our consular agent residing there,\r\nthe official document of which when received will be laid before the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Government has been drawn with great solicitude to\r\nother subjects, and particularly to that relating to a state of maritime\r\nwar, involving the relative rights of neutral and belligerent in such wars.\r\nMost of the difficulties which we have experienced and of the losses which\r\nwe have sustained since the establishment of our independence have\r\nproceeded from the unsettled state of those rights and the extent to which\r\nthe belligerent claim has been carried against the neutral party.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to look back on the occurrences of the late wars in\r\nEurope, and to behold the disregard which was paid to our rights as a\r\nneutral power, and the waste which was made of our commerce by the parties\r\nto those wars by various acts of their respective Governments, and under\r\nthe pretext by each that the other had set the example, without great\r\nmortification and a fixed purpose never to submit to the like in future. An\r\nattempt to remove those causes of possible variance by friendly negotiation\r\nand on just principles which should be applicable to all parties could, it\r\nwas presumed, be viewed by none other than as a proof of an earnest desire\r\nto preserve those relations with every power.\r\n\r\nIn the late war between France and Spain a crisis occurred in which it\r\nseemed probable that all controvertible principles involved in such wars\r\nmight be brought into discussion and settled to the satisfaction of all\r\nparties. Propositions having this object in view have been made to the\r\nGovernments of Great Britain, France, Russia, and of other powers, which\r\nhave been received in a friendly manner by all, but as yet no treaty has\r\nbeen formed with either for its accomplishment. The policy will, it is\r\npresumed, be persevered in, and in the hope that it may be successful.\r\n\r\nIt will always be recollected that with one of the parties to those wars\r\nand from whom we received those injuries, we sought redress by war. From\r\nthe other, by whose then reigning Government our vessels were seized in\r\nport as well as at sea and their cargoes confiscated, indemnity has been\r\nexpected, but has not yet been rendered. It was under the influence of the\r\nlatter that our vessels were likewise seized by the Governments of Spain,\r\nHolland, Denmark, Sweden, and Naples, and from whom indemnity has been\r\nclaimed and is still expected, with the exception of Spain, by whom it has\r\nbeen rendered.\r\n\r\nWith both parties we had abundant cause of war, but we had no alternative\r\nbut to resist that which was most powerful at sea and pressed us nearest at\r\nhome. With this all differences were settled by a treaty, founded on\r\nconditions fair and honorable to both, and which has been so far executed\r\nwith perfect good faith. It has been earnestly hoped that the other would\r\nof its own accord, and from a sentiment of justice and conciliation, make\r\nto our citizens the indemnity to which they are entitled, and thereby\r\nremove from our relations any just cause of discontent on our side.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury during the current\r\nyear, exclusive of loans, will exceed $18.5 millions, which, with the\r\nsum remaining in the Treasury at the end of the last year, amounting\r\nto $9,463,922.81 will, after discharging the current disbursements of\r\nthe year, the interest on the public debt, and upward of $11,633,011.52\r\nof the principal, leave a balance of more than $3 millions in the Treasury\r\non the first day of January next.\r\n\r\nA larger amount of the debt contracted during the late war, bearing an\r\ninterest of 6%, becoming redeemable in the course of the ensuing year than\r\ncould be discharged by the ordinary revenue, the act of the 26th of May\r\nauthorized a loan of $5 millions at 4.5% to meet the same. By this\r\narrangement an annual saving will accrue to the public of $75,000.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of the 24th of May last a loan of $5 millions was authorized,\r\nIn order to meet the awards under the Florida treaty, which was negotiated\r\nat par with the Bank of the United States at 4.5%, the limit of interest\r\nfixed by the act. By this provision the claims of our citizens who had\r\nsustained so great a loss by spoliations, and from whom indemnity had been\r\nso long withheld, were promptly paid. For these advances the public will\r\nbe amply repaid at no distant day by the sale of the lands in Florida. Of\r\nthe great advantages resulting from the acquisition of the Territory in\r\nother respects too high an estimate can not be formed.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury during the year 1825\r\nwill be sufficient to meet the disbursements of the year, including the\r\nsum of $10 millions, which is annually appropriated by the act of\r\nconstituting the sinking fund to the payment of the principal and interest\r\nof the public debt.\r\n\r\nThe whole amount of the public debt on the first of January next may be\r\nestimated at $86 millions, inclusive of $2.5 millions of the loan\r\nauthorized by the act of the 26th of May last. In this estimate is\r\nincluded a stock of $7 millions, issued for the purchase of that amount\r\nof the capital stock of the Bank of the United States, and which, as the\r\nstock of the bank still held by the Government will at least be fully\r\nequal to its reimbursement, ought not to be considered as constituting\r\na part of the public debt.\r\n\r\nEstimating, then, the whole amount of the public debt at $79 millions\r\nand regarding the annual receipts and expenditures of the Government, a\r\nwell-founded hope may be entertained that, should no unexpected event\r\noccur, the whole of the public debt may be discharged in the course of\r\nten years, and the Government be left at liberty thereafter to apply such\r\nportion of the revenue as may not be necessary for current expenses to\r\nsuch other objects as may be most conducive to the public security and\r\nwelfare. That the sums applicable to these objects will be very\r\nconsiderable may be fairly concluded when it is recollected that a\r\nlarge amount of the public revenue has been applied since the late\r\nwar to the construction of the public buildings in this city; to the\r\nerection of fortifications along the coast and of arsenals in different\r\nparts of the Union; to the augmentation of the Navy; to the extinguishment\r\nof the Indian title to large tracts of fertile territory; to the\r\nacquisition of Florida; to pensions to Revolutionary officers and\r\nsoldiers, and to invalids of the late war.\r\n\r\nOn many of these objects the expense will annually be diminished and cease\r\nat no distant period on most of them.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1817, the public debt amounted to $123,491,965.16,\r\nand, notwithstanding the large sums which have been applied to these\r\nobjects, it has been reduced since that period $37,446,961.78. The last\r\nportion of the public debt will be redeemable on January 1st, 1835, and,\r\nwhile there is the best reason to believe that the resources of the\r\nGovernment will be continually adequate to such portions of it as may\r\nbecome due in the interval, it is recommended to Congress to seize every\r\nopportunity which may present itself to reduce the rate of interest on\r\nevery part thereof. The high state of the public credit and the great\r\nabundance of money are at this time very favorable to such a result. It\r\nmust be very gratifying to our fellow citizens to witness this flourishing\r\nstate of the public finances when it is recollected that no burthen\r\nwhatever has been imposed upon them.\r\n\r\nThe military establishment in all its branches, in the performance of the\r\nvarious duties assigned to each, justifies the favorable view which was\r\npresented of the efficiency of its organization at the last session. All\r\nthe appropriations have been regularly applied to the objects intended by\r\nCongress, and so far as the disbursements have been made the accounts have\r\nbeen rendered and settled without loss to the public.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Army itself, as relates to the officers and men, in\r\nscience and discipline is highly respectable. The Military Academy, on\r\nwhich the Army essentially rests, and to which it is much indebted for this\r\nstate of improvement, has attained, in comparison with any other\r\ninstitution of a like kind, a high degree of perfection.\r\n\r\nExperience, however, has shewn that the dispersed condition of the corps of\r\nartillery is unfavorable to the discipline of that important branch of the\r\nmilitary establishment. To remedy this inconvenience, eleven companies have\r\nbeen assembled at the fortification erected at Old Point Comfort as a\r\nschool for artillery instruction, with intention as they shall be perfected\r\nin the various duties of that service to order them to other posts, and, to\r\nsupply their places with other companies for instruction in like manner. In\r\nthis mode a complete knowledge of the science and duties of this arm will\r\nbe extended throughout the whole corps of artillery. But to carry this\r\nobject fully into effect will require the aid of Congress, to obtain which\r\nthe subject is now submitted to your consideration.\r\n\r\nOf the progress which has been made in the construction of fortifications\r\nfor the permanent defense of our maritime frontier, according to the plan\r\ndecided on and to the extent of the existing appropriations, the report of\r\nthe Secretary of War, which is herewith communicated, will give a detailed\r\naccount. Their final completion can not fail to give great additional\r\nsecurity to that frontier, and to diminish proportionably the expense of\r\ndefending it in the event of war.\r\n\r\nThe provisions in several acts of Congress of the last session for the\r\nimprovement of the navigation of the Mississippi and the Ohio, of the\r\nharbor of Presqu'isle, on Lake Erie, and the repair of the Plymouth beach\r\nare in a course of regular execution; and there is reason to believe that\r\nthe appropriation in each instance will be adequate to the object. To carry\r\nthese improvements fully into effect, the superintendence of them has been\r\nassigned to officers of the Corps of Engineers.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of 30th April last, authorizing the President to cause a\r\nsurvey to be made, with the necessary plans and estimates, of such roads\r\nand canals as he might deem of national importance in a commercial or\r\nmilitary point of view, or for the transportation of the mail, a board has\r\nbeen instituted, consisting of two distinguished officers of the Corps of\r\nEngineers and a distinguished civil engineer, with assistants, who have\r\nbeen actively employed in carrying into effect the object of the act. They\r\nhave carefully examined the route between the Potomac and the Ohio rivers;\r\nbetween the latter and Lake Erie; between the Alleghany and the\r\nSusquehannah; and the routes between the Delaware and the Raritan,\r\nBarnstable and Buzzards Bay, and between Boston Harbor and Narraganset Bay.\r\nSuch portion of the Corps of Topographical Engineers as could be spared\r\nfrom the survey of the coast has been employed in surveying the very\r\nimportant route between the Potomac and the Ohio. Considerable progress has\r\nbeen made in it, but the survey can not be completed until the next season.\r\nIt is gratifying to add, from the view already taken, that there is good\r\ncause to believe that this great national object may be fully\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIt is contemplated to commence early in the next season the execution of\r\nthe other branch of the act--that which relates to roads--and with the\r\nsurvey of a route from this city, through the Southern States, to New\r\nOrleans, the importance of which can not be too highly estimated. All the\r\nofficers of both the corps of engineers who could be spared from other\r\nservices have been employed in exploring and surveying the routes for\r\ncanals. To digest a plan for both objects for the great purposes specified\r\nwill require a thorough knowledge of every part of our Union and of the\r\nrelation of each part to the others and of all to the seat of the General\r\nGovernment. For such a digest it will be necessary that the information be\r\nfull, minute, and precise.\r\n\r\nWith a view to these important objects, I submit to the consideration of\r\nthe Congress the propriety of enlarging both the corps of engineers--the\r\nmilitary and topographical. It need scarcely be remarked that the more\r\nextensively these corps are engaged in the improvement of their country, in\r\nthe execution of the powers of Congress, and in aid of the States in such\r\nimprovements as lie beyond that limit, when such aid is desired, the\r\nhappier the effect will be in many views of which the subject is\r\nperceptible. By profiting of their science the works will always be well\r\nexecuted, and by giving to the officers such employment our Union will\r\nderive all the advantage, in peace as well as in war, from their talents\r\nand services which they can afford. In this mode, also, the military will\r\nbe incorporated with the civil, and unfounded and injurious distinctions\r\nand prejudices of every kind be done away. To the corps themselves this\r\nservice can not fail to be equally useful, since by the knowledge they\r\nwould thus acquire they would be eminently better qualified in the event of\r\nwar for the great purposes for which they were instituted.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Indian tribes within our limits have not been\r\nmaterially changed during the year. The hostile disposition evinced by\r\ncertain tribes on the Missouri during the last year still continues, and\r\nhas extended in some degree to those on the Upper Mississippi and the Upper\r\nLakes. Several parties of our citizens have been plundered and murdered by\r\nthose tribes. In order to establish relations of friendship with them,\r\nCongress at the last session made an appropriation for treaties with them\r\nand for the employment of a suitable military escort to accompany and\r\nattend the commissioners at the places appointed for the negotiations. This\r\nobject has not been effected. The season was too far advanced when the\r\nappropriation was made and the distance too great to permit it, but\r\nmeasures have been taken, and all the preparations will be completed to\r\naccomplish it at an early period in the next season.\r\n\r\nBelieving that the hostility of the tribes, particularly on the Upper\r\nMississippi and the Lakes, is in no small degree owing to the wars which\r\nare carried on between the tribes residing in that quarter, measures have\r\nbeen taken to bring about a general peace among them, which, if successful,\r\nwill not only tend to the security of our citizens, but be of great\r\nadvantage to the Indians themselves.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the tribes referred to, our relations with all the\r\nothers are on the same friendly footing, and it affords me great\r\nsatisfaction to add that they are making steady advances in civilization\r\nand the improvement of their condition. Many of the tribes have already\r\nmade great progress in the arts of civilized life. This desirable result\r\nhas been brought about by the humane and persevering policy of the\r\nGovernment, and particularly by means of the appropriation for the\r\ncivilization of the Indians. There have been established under the\r\nprovisions of this act 32 schools, containing 916 scholars, who are well\r\ninstructed in several branches of literature, and likewise in agriculture\r\nand the ordinary arts of life.\r\n\r\nUnder the appropriation to authorize treaties with the Creeks and Quaupaw\r\nIndians commissioners have been appointed and negotiations are now pending,\r\nbut the result is not yet known.\r\n\r\nFor more full information respecting the principle which has been adopted\r\nfor carrying into effect the act of Congress authorizing surveys, with\r\nplans and estimates for canals and roads, and on every other branch of duty\r\nincident to the Department of War, I refer you to the report of the\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nThe squadron in the Mediterranean has been maintained in the extent which\r\nwas proposed in the report of the Secretary of the Navy of the last year,\r\nand has afforded to our commerce the necessary protection in that sea.\r\nApprehending, however, that the unfriendly relations which have existed\r\nbetween Algiers and some of the powers of Europe might be extended to us,\r\nit has been thought expedient to augment the force there, and in\r\nconsequence the North Carolina, a ship of the line, has been prepared, and\r\nwill sail in a few days to join it.\r\n\r\nThe force employed in the Gulf of Mexico and in the neighboring seas for\r\nthe suppression of piracy has likewise been preserved essentially in the\r\nstate in which it was during the last year. A persevering effort has been\r\nmade for the accomplishment of that object, and much protection has thereby\r\nbeen afforded to our commerce, but still the practice is far from being\r\nsuppressed. From every view which has been taken of the subject it is\r\nthought that it will be necessary rather to augment than to diminish our\r\nforce in that quarter.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the piracies now complained of are\r\ncommitted by bands of robbers who inhabit the land, and who, by preserving\r\ngood intelligence with the towns and seizing favorable opportunities, rush\r\nforth and fall on unprotected merchant vessels, of which they make an easy\r\nprey. The pillage thus taken they carry to their lurking places, and\r\ndispose of afterwards at prices tending to seduce the neighboring\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThis combination is understood to be of great extent, and is the more to be\r\ndeprecated because the crime of piracy is often attended with the murder of\r\nthe crews, these robbers knowing if any survived their lurking places would\r\nbe exposed and they be caught and punished. That this atrocious practice\r\nshould be carried to such extent is cause of equal surprise and regret. It\r\nis presumed that it must be attributed to the relaxed and feeble state of\r\nthe local governments, since it is not doubted, from the high character of\r\nthe governor of Cuba, who is well known and much respected here, that if he\r\nhad the power he would promptly suppress it. Whether those robbers should\r\nbe pursued on the land, the local authorities be made responsible for these\r\natrocities, or any other measure be resorted to to suppress them, is\r\nsubmitted to the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn execution of the laws for the suppression of the slave trade a vessel\r\nhas been occasionally sent from that squadron to the coast of Africa with\r\norders to return thence by the usual track of the slave ships, and to seize\r\nany of our vessels which might be engaged in that trade. None have been\r\nfound, and it is believed that none are thus employed. It is well known,\r\nhowever, that the trade still exists under other flags.\r\n\r\nThe health of our squadron while at Thompsons Island has been much better\r\nduring the present than it was the last season. Some improvements have been\r\nmade and others are contemplated there which, it is believed, will have a\r\nvery salutary effect.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific, our commerce has much increased, and on that coast, as well\r\nas on that sea, the United States have many important interests which\r\nrequire attention and protection. It is thought that all the considerations\r\nwhich suggested the expediency of placing a squadron on that sea operate\r\nwith augmented force for maintaining it there, at least in equal extent.\r\n\r\nFor detailed information respecting the state of our maritime force on each\r\nsea, the improvement necessary to be made on either in the organization of\r\nthe naval establishment generally, and of the laws for its better\r\ngovernment I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy, which is\r\nherewith communicated.\r\n\r\nThe revenue of the Post Office Department has received a considerable\r\naugmentation in the present year. The current receipts will exceed the\r\nexpenditures, although the transportation of the mail within the year has\r\nbeen much increased. A report of the Post Master General, which is\r\ntransmitted, will furnish in detail the necessary information respecting\r\nthe administration and present state of this Department.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with a resolution of Congress of the last session, an\r\ninvitation was given to General Lafayette to visit the United States, with\r\nan assurance that a ship of war should attend at any port of France which\r\nhe might designate, to receive and convey him across the Atlantic, whenever\r\nit might be convenient for him to sail. He declined the offer of the public\r\nship from motives of delicacy, but assured me that he had long intended and\r\nwould certainly visit our Union in the course of the present year.\r\n\r\nIn August last he arrived at New York, where he was received with the\r\nwarmth of affection and gratitude to which his very important and\r\ndisinterested services and sacrifices in our Revolutionary struggle so\r\neminently entitled him. A corresponding sentiment has since been manifested\r\nin his favor throughout every portion of our Union, and affectionate\r\ninvitations have been given him to extend his visits to them. To these he\r\nhas yielded all the accommodation in his power. At every designated point\r\nof rendezvous the whole population of the neighboring country has been\r\nassembled to greet him, among whom it has excited in a peculiar manner the\r\nsensibility of all to behold the surviving members of our Revolutionary\r\ncontest, civil and military, who had shared with him in the toils and\r\ndangers of the war, many of them in a decrepit state. A more interesting\r\nspectacle, it is believed, was never witnessed, because none could be\r\nfounded on purer principles, none proceed from higher or more disinterested\r\nmotives. That the feelings of those who had fought and bled with him in a\r\ncommon cause should have been much excited was natural.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, circumstances attending these interviews which pervaded\r\nthe whole community and touched the breasts of every age, even the youngest\r\namong us. There was not an individual present who had not some relative who\r\nhad not partaken in those scenes, nor an infant who had not heard the\r\nrelation of them. But the circumstance which was most sensibly felt, and\r\nwhich his presence brought forcibly to the recollection of all, was the\r\ngreat cause in which we were engaged and the blessings which we have\r\nderived from our success in it.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was for independence and liberty, public and personal, and in\r\nthis we succeeded. The meeting with one who had borne so distinguished a\r\npart in that great struggle, and from such lofty and disinterested motives,\r\ncould not fail to affect profoundly every individual and of every age. It\r\nis natural that we should all take a deep interest in his future welfare,\r\nas we do. His high claims on our Union are felt, and the sentiment\r\nuniversal that they should be met in a generous spirit. Under these\r\nimpressions I invite your attention to the subject, with a view that,\r\nregarding his very important services, losses, and sacrifices, a provision\r\nmay be made and tendered to him which shall correspond with the sentiments\r\nand be worthy the character of the American people.\r\n\r\nIn turning our attention to the condition of the civilized world, in which\r\nthe United States have always taken a deep interest, it is gratifying to\r\nsee how large a portion of it is blessed with peace. The only wars which\r\nnow exist within that limit are those between Turkey and Greece, in Europe,\r\nand between Spain and the new Governments, our neighbors, in this\r\nhemisphere. In both these wars the cause of independence, of liberty and\r\nhumanity, continues to prevail.\r\n\r\nThe success of Greece, when the relative population of the contending\r\nparties is considered, commands our admiration and applause, and that it\r\nhas had a similar effect with the neighboring powers is obvious. The\r\nfeeling of the whole civilized world is excited in a high degree in their\r\nfavor. May we not hope that these sentiments, winning on the hearts of\r\ntheir respective Governments, may lead to a more decisive result; that they\r\nmay produce an accord among them to replace Greece on the ground which she\r\nformerly held, and to which her heroic exertions at this day so eminently\r\nentitle her?\r\n\r\nWith respect to the contest to which our neighbors are a party, it is\r\nevident that Spain as a power is scarcely felt in it. These new States had\r\ncompletely achieved their independence before it was acknowledged by the\r\nUnited States, and they have since maintained it with little foreign\r\npressure. The disturbances which have appeared in certain portions of that\r\nvast territory have proceeded from internal causes, which had their origin\r\nin their former Governments and have not yet been thoroughly removed.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that these causes are daily losing their effect, and that\r\nthese new States are settling down under Governments elective and\r\nrepresentative in every branch, similar to our own. In this course we\r\nardently wish them to persevere, under a firm conviction that it will\r\npromote their happiness. In this, their career, however, we have not\r\ninterfered, believing that every people have a right to institute for\r\nthemselves the government which, in their judgment, may suit them best.\r\n\r\nOur example is before them, of the good effect of which, being our\r\nneighbors, they are competent judges, and to their judgment we leave it, in\r\nthe expectation that other powers will pursue the same policy. The deep\r\ninterest which we take in their independence, which we have acknowledged,\r\nand in their enjoyment of all the rights incident thereto, especially in\r\nthe very important one of instituting their own Governments, has been\r\ndeclared, and is known to the world.\r\n\r\nSeparated as we are from Europe by the great Atlantic Ocean, we can have no\r\nconcern in the wars of the European Governments nor in the causes which\r\nproduce them. The balance of power between them, into whichever scale it\r\nmay turn in its various vibrations, can not affect us. It is the interest\r\nof the United States to preserve the most friendly relations with every\r\npower and on conditions fair, equal, and applicable to all.\r\n\r\nBut in regard to our neighbors our situation is different. It is impossible\r\nfor the European Governments to interfere in their concerns, especially in\r\nthose alluded to, which are vital, without affecting us; indeed, the motive\r\nwhich might induce such interference in the present state of the war\r\nbetween the parties, if a war it may be called, would appear to be equally\r\napplicable to us. It is gratifying to know that some of the powers with\r\nwhom we enjoy a very friendly intercourse, and to whom these views have\r\nbeen communicated, have appeared to acquiesce in them.\r\n\r\nThe augmentation of our population with the expansion of our Union and\r\nincreased number of States have produced effects in certain branches of our\r\nsystem which merit the attention of Congress. Some of our arrangements, and\r\nparticularly the judiciary establishment, were made with a view to the\r\noriginal thirteen States only. Since then the United States have acquired\r\na vast extent of territory; eleven new States have been admitted into the\r\nUnion, and Territories have been laid off for three others, which will\r\nlikewise be admitted at no distant day.\r\n\r\nAn organization of the Supreme Court which assigns the judges any portion\r\nof the duties which belong to the inferior, requiring their passage over so\r\nvast a space under any distribution of the States that may now be made, if\r\nnot impracticable in the execution, must render it impossible for them to\r\ndischarge the duties of either branch with advantage to the Union. The\r\nduties of the Supreme Court would be of great importance if its decisions\r\nwere confined to the ordinary limits of other tribunals, but when it is\r\nconsidered that this court decides, and in the last resort, on all the\r\ngreat questions which arise under our Constitution, involving those between\r\nthe United States individually, between the States and the United States,\r\nand between the latter and foreign powers, too high an estimate of their\r\nimportance can not be formed. The great interests of the nation seem to\r\nrequire that the judges of the Supreme Court should be exempted from every\r\nother duty than those which are incident to that high trust. The\r\norganization of the inferior courts would of course be adapted to\r\ncircumstances. It is presumed that such an one might be formed as would\r\nsecure an able and faithful discharge of their duties, and without any\r\nmaterial augmentation of expense.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the aborigines within our limits, and especially those who\r\nare within the limits of any of the States, merits likewise particular\r\nattention. Experience has shown that unless the tribes be civilized they\r\ncan never be incorporated into our system in any form whatever. It has\r\nlikewise shown that in the regular augmentation of our population with the\r\nextension of our settlements their situation will become deplorable, if\r\ntheir extinction is not menaced.\r\n\r\nSome well-digested plan which will rescue them from such calamities is due\r\nto their rights, to the rights of humanity, and to the honor of the nation.\r\nTheir civilization is indispensable to their safety, and this can be\r\naccomplished only by degrees. The process must commence with the infant\r\nstate, through whom some effect may be wrought on the parental.\r\nDifficulties of the most serious character present themselves to the\r\nattainment of this very desirable result on the territory on which they now\r\nreside. To remove them from it by force, even with a view to their own\r\nsecurity and happiness, would be revolting to humanity and utterly\r\nunjustifiable. Between the limits of our present States and Territories and\r\nthe Rocky Mountains and Mexico there is a vast territory to which they\r\nmight be invited with inducements which might be successful. It is thought\r\nif that territory should be divided into districts by previous agreement\r\nwith the tribes now residing there and civil governments be established in\r\neach, with schools for every branch of instruction in literature and the\r\narts of civilized life, that all the tribes now within our limits might\r\ngradually be drawn there. The execution of this plan would necessarily be\r\nattended with expense, and that not inconsiderable, but it is doubted\r\nwhether any other can be devised which would be less liable to that\r\nobjection or more likely to succeed.\r\n\r\nIn looking to the interests which the United States have on the Pacific\r\nOcean and on the western coast of this continent, the propriety of\r\nestablishing a military post at the mouth of the Columbia River, or at some\r\nother point in that quarter within our acknowledged limits, is submitted to\r\nthe consideration of Congress. Our commerce and fisheries on that sea and\r\nalong the coast have much increased and are increasing. It is thought that\r\na military post, to which our ships of war might resort, would afford\r\nprotection to every interest, and have a tendency to conciliate the tribes\r\nto the North West, with whom our trade is extensive. It is thought also\r\nthat by the establishment of such a post the intercourse between our\r\nWestern States and Territories and the Pacific and our trade with the\r\ntribes residing in the interior on each side of the Rocky Mountains would\r\nbe essentially promoted. To carry this object into effect the appropriation\r\nof an adequate sum to authorize the employment of a frigate, with an\r\nofficer of the Corps of Engineers, to explore the mouth of the Columbia\r\nRiver and the coast contiguous thereto, to enable the Executive to make\r\nsuch establishment at the most suitable point, is recommended to Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that attention is also due to the improvement of this city.\r\nThe communication between the public buildings and in various other parts\r\nand the grounds around those buildings require it. It is presumed also that\r\nthe completion of the canal from the Tiber to the Eastern Branch would have\r\na very salutary effect. Great exertions have been made and expenses\r\nincurred by the citizens in improvements of various kinds; but those which\r\nare suggested belong exclusively to the Government, or are of a nature to\r\nrequire expenditures beyond their resources. The public lots which are\r\nstill for sale would, it is not doubted, be more than adequate for these\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nFrom the view above presented it is manifest that the situation of the\r\nUnited States is in the highest degree prosperous and happy. There is no\r\nobject which as a people we can desire which we do not possess or which is\r\nnot within our reach. Blessed with governments the happiest which the world\r\never knew, with no distinct orders in society or divided interests in any\r\nportion of the vast territory over which their dominion extends, we have\r\nevery motive to cling together which can animate a virtuous and enlightened\r\npeople. The great object is to preserve these blessings, and to hand them\r\ndown to the latest posterity.\r\n\r\nOur experience ought to satisfy us that our progress under the most correct\r\nand provident policy will not be exempt from danger. Our institutions form\r\nan important epoch in the history of the civilized world. On their\r\npreservation and in their utmost purity everything will depend. Extending\r\nas our interests do to every part of the inhabited globe and to every sea\r\nto which our citizens are carried by their industry and enterprise, to\r\nwhich they are invited by the wants of others, and have a right to go, we\r\nmust either protect them in the enjoyment of their rights or abandon them\r\nin certain events to waste and desolation.\r\n\r\nOur attitude is highly interesting as relates to other powers, and\r\nparticularly to our southern neighbors. We have duties to perform with\r\nregard to all to which we must be faithful. To every kind of danger we\r\nshould pay the most vigilant and unceasing attention, remove the cause\r\nwhere it may be practicable, and be prepared to meet it when inevitable.\r\n\r\nAgainst foreign danger the policy of the Government seems to be already\r\nsettled. The events of the late war admonished us to make our maritime\r\nfrontier impregnable by a well-digested chain of fortifications, and to\r\ngive efficient protection to our commerce by augmenting our Navy to a\r\ncertain extent, which has been steadily pursued, and which it is incumbent\r\nupon us to complete as soon as circumstances will permit. In the event of\r\nwar it is on the maritime frontier that we shall be assailed. It is in that\r\nquarter, therefore, that we should be prepared to meet the attack. It is\r\nthere that our whole force will be called into action to prevent the\r\ndestruction of our towns and the desolation and pillage of the interior.\r\n\r\nTo give full effect to this policy great improvements will be\r\nindispensable. Access to those works by every practicable communication\r\nshould be made easy and in every direction. The intercourse between every\r\npart of our Union should also be promoted and facilitated by the exercise\r\nof those powers which may comport with a faithful regard to the great\r\nprinciples of our Constitution. With respect to internal causes, those\r\ngreat principles point out with equal certainty the policy to be pursued.\r\n\r\nResting on the people as our Governments do, State and National, with\r\nwell-defined powers, it is of the highest importance that they severally\r\nkeep within the limits prescribed to them. Fulfilling that sacred duty, it\r\nis of equal importance that the movement between them be harmonious, and in\r\ncase of any disagreement, should any such occur, a calm appeal be made to\r\nthe people, and that their voice be heard and promptly obeyed. Both\r\nGovernments being instituted for the common good, we can not fail to\r\nprosper while those who made them are attentive to the conduct of their\r\nrepresentatives and control their measures. In the pursuit of these great\r\nobjects let a generous spirit and national views and feelings be indulged,\r\nand let every part recollect that by cherishing that spirit and improving\r\nthe condition of the others in what relates to their welfare the general\r\ninterest will not only be promoted, but the local advantage be reciprocated\r\nby all.\r\n\r\nI can not conclude this communication, the last of the kind which I shall\r\nhave to make, without recollecting with great sensibility and heart felt\r\ngratitude the many instances of the public confidence and the generous\r\nsupport which I have received from my fellow citizens in the various trusts\r\nwith which I have been honored. Having commenced my service in early youth,\r\nand continued it since with few and short intervals, I have witnessed the\r\ngreat difficulties to which our Union has been surmounted. From the present\r\nprosperous and happy state I derive a gratification which I can not\r\nexpress. That these blessings may be preserved and perpetuated will be the\r\nobject of my fervent and unceasing prayers to the Supreme Ruler of the\r\nUniverse.",
