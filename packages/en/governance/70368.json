The citizen in a democracy must know what his government\r\nis doing, or he will lack the soundest basis for judging the\r\ncandidates and the platforms of our political parties.\r\n\r\nOur elected officials are given only a temporary grant of power,\r\nand only a temporary custody of government property and government\r\nrecords. Neither the President nor those he appoints have any royal\r\nprerogative; they have only a limited right to steer our government\r\nwithin the framework of the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nIt is well to remember that every withholding of government business\r\nfrom the public is an encroachment upon the democratic principle that\r\ngovernment officials are accountable to the people. It follows that\r\ncitizens should regard all governmental secrecy with some suspicion\r\nas an encroachment on their right to know.\r\n\r\nThe American citizen should reject all arbitrary claims to secrecy\r\nby the bureaucracy as sharply as he would reject any claims to a\r\nright of the executive branch to by-pass Congress in levying taxes.\r\nA wise citizen should be as outraged at arbitrary secrecy as he\r\nwould be at arbitrary imprisonment. Logically he should insist on\r\nthe same safeguards against arbitrary secrecy that he would against\r\nunjustified arrest or taxation. The public’s “right to know” is that\r\nbasic.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is a general tendency to regard government\r\nsecrecy as only a problem for the newspapers. And even within the\r\nnewspaper profession there is a tendency to ignore government secrecy\r\nuntil it interferes with a story the individual reporter or editor\r\nwants to develop.\r\n\r\nI am not interested in pleading for any special right of access to\r\ngovernment information for newspapers or reporters. As vital as their\r\nfunction is, newspapers, magazines, television and radio for the most\r\npart merely provide an orderly process for disseminating information\r\nabout government to the people who do not have the time, money,\r\nor technical facility to acquire the information for themselves.\r\nTransmitting information gathered at a government press conference or\r\nthrough a government press release does not necessarily answer the\r\npeople’s right to know.\r\n\r\nThe public has a right to expect that its government’s press releases\r\nwill be factually accurate, and for the most part they are. We\r\nalso have a right to expect our highest officials to be factually\r\naccurate, but we must recognize realistically that it is only normal\r\nfor them to color facts with opinions and conclusions that are most\r\nfavorable to the political party in power.\r\n\r\nThis manipulation, shading, twisting, or omission of facts—often\r\nreferred to as “managing the news”—will be limited only by the\r\npolitical fear of being exposed for having made erroneous or\r\nintentionally misleading statements to the public. As reprehensible\r\nas the practice can be, it is nevertheless a political fact of life\r\nand those who lament its existence would do better to bolster the\r\none sure safeguard against it: the people’s right to know—through\r\nthe press and through their elected representatives in Congress.\r\nNews management, I repeat, can be controlled only by insisting on\r\nthe public’s right to go behind the statements distributed by the\r\ngovernment agencies or by high government officials.\r\n\r\nThose who manipulate the news or try to cover their tracks with\r\narbitrary secrecy are not likely to be pursuing totalitarian goals.\r\nUsually the only motivation is short-term political gain. Often it\r\nis rationalized on grounds that a few factual errors and overdrawn\r\nconclusions are not important when viewed in the total context of\r\nthe achievements of the party in power. There is also the standard\r\nrationalization that a few distortions only serve to balance the\r\ndistortions of the other political party.\r\n\r\nNo administration enjoys admitting errors or mismanagement of\r\ngovernment. Because the criticism is usually initiated by the\r\npolitical opposition, it is often harsh and overdrawn. An instinctive\r\ndefensiveness springs up within the defending political party, and\r\nthe battle rages.\r\n\r\nIn the classic political controversy, the initial criticism has been\r\nfollowed by a demand for a full investigation. The press has already\r\ndone some investigative work and has printed stories dealing with\r\nall available aspects of the controversy. However, when the probing\r\nby the press or by private citizens has not been conclusive, the\r\nCongress, throughout the history of the United States, has launched\r\ninvestigations to dig out the facts not otherwise available to the\r\npress or the public. And almost as often as the Congress has dug in,\r\nthe executive branch has refused or been reluctant to co-operate.\r\n\r\nA truly thorough investigation of the executive branch can be\r\nconducted only in the Congress. It is unreasonable to believe that\r\nan Attorney General, appointed by the President, will aggressively\r\ndelve into an investigation of matters that might embarrass his own\r\nadministration. For this reason, the right of the public and the\r\npress to government information is for the most part contingent upon\r\nthe power of Congress to obtain documents and testimony from the\r\nexecutive branch.\r\n\r\nIf the committees of Congress, acting within the scope of their\r\nauthority, cannot obtain access to all the facts on government\r\nactivity, then the facts can be arbitrarily hidden for the\r\nduration of the administration’s power. Who would argue that\r\nany administration should be allowed to bury its crimes, its\r\nmismanagement, and its errors until a public, barred from full facts\r\non these matters, decides to vote that party from power? Such a\r\nphilosophy would put a premium on the Washington cover-up.\r\n\r\nProperly authorized committees must have the power to compel\r\ngovernment officials to testify and produce government records. If\r\nthis power is lacking, the Congress, the press, and the public are\r\ndependent upon the information or half-information that the executive\r\nbranch chooses to release. It should be obvious to even a novice\r\nin politics that politicians are not likely to voluntarily produce\r\ntestimony or records that may harm their own aspirations.\r\n\r\nMost congressional requests for information have been filled without\r\ntrouble. The executive branch has resisted, however, whenever it\r\nseemed likely that congressional hearings would expose some political\r\nfavorite or embarrass the administration. Invariably it has been\r\nclaimed that the Congress was invading the executive branch and that\r\nsome constitutional issue was involved.\r\n\r\nIn this book I will show how the executive branch, beginning with\r\nGeorge Washington’s administration, has handled requests from\r\nCongress for delivery of information. And I will show how the\r\ntendency to withhold information has grown, particularly since World\r\nWar II.\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to argue that all government information\r\nshould be made public immediately, for I am fully aware of the\r\nneed for security on military matters as well as the need for some\r\nrestrictions on release of information from personnel files and\r\ninvestigative files.\r\n\r\nIn practice, we must allow our elected officials the right to\r\nwithhold some kinds of information from the public. War plans and\r\nother papers involving military security are the more obvious\r\nexamples. But any withholding should be done under specific grants of\r\nauthority from Congress or under specific grants in the Constitution,\r\nand the authority should be carefully limited. The broad right of\r\narbitrary withholding of information is not something that any\r\nofficials should be permitted to arrogate to themselves.\r\n\r\nThere is ample justification for laws that set out areas of military\r\ninformation to be withheld from the general public. There always\r\nhas been. It would be especially foolhardy in these days of serious\r\ninternational tension to insist on a full public disclosure of our\r\nmilitary posture. However, this does not mean that all persons\r\noutside the military establishment should be barred from access\r\nto military information. There should be no question about proper\r\ncommittees of Congress having access to nearly all information on\r\nmilitary spending, for this is the only way the Congress can obtain\r\nsufficient information for passing laws and appropriating money.\r\nAlso, the auditors of the General Accounting Office (GAO) must have\r\naccess to all but the most highly classified Defense secrets, or\r\nthey will be unable to carry out their duties of determining whether\r\nexpenditures are being made in an efficient and lawful manner.\r\n\r\nThere might also be justification for withholding information from\r\nthe public when it involves diplomatic negotiations with a foreign\r\nnation. However, barring the public should not bar the GAO or\r\nproperly authorized committees of Congress except under the most\r\nunusual and most clearly delineated circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere are other areas of government in which secrecy is justified.\r\nThese include the raw investigative files of the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation (FBI), and some parts of the government personnel\r\nfiles. There are clear reasons for barring the public from the FBI\r\ninvestigative files, for these files contain much unevaluated rumor\r\nand many unauthenticated documents. Also, as FBI Director J. Edgar\r\nHoover has pointed out, much mischief could be done by the underworld\r\nand subversive elements if they had access to FBI files.\r\n\r\nBut while we are using a limited secrecy to guard our chief\r\nfederal investigative agency, we must realize that law enforcement\r\nagencies can go wrong if there is not some regular scrutiny from\r\nthe outside. This was demonstrated in the twenties, just prior to\r\nthe time when J. Edgar Hoover was put in charge of cleaning up the\r\nfederal investigative agency. We have been fortunate to have a J.\r\nEdgar Hoover heading the FBI, but we cannot assume that the office\r\nwill always be filled by one whose major ambition is creating and\r\nmaintaining a skilled career investigative agency.\r\n\r\nUnder unusual circumstances, arrangements have been made for\r\nexamination of an entire FBI file by the chairmen of the Judiciary\r\ncommittees of the House and Senate. On occasion, the ranking minority\r\nmember of these committees has taken part. Since this procedure\r\nprovides for examination by a Democrat and a Republican, it has the\r\nstrength of being bipartisan. It has the disadvantage of depending\r\non the character and personality of the majority and minority\r\nrepresentatives for true bipartisanship. The procedure is a touchy\r\none that the press, the public, and the Congress must scrutinize\r\nperiodically. Certainly the FBI must have a right to keep its files\r\nsecret from the public, but it should never be forgotten that some\r\nlimited bipartisan congressional group must have authority to examine\r\nthese files if we are to remain secure from possible abuse of power.\r\n\r\nPresident Truman wrapped government personnel files in secrecy on the\r\ntheory that making them available to a Republican-dominated committee\r\nof Congress could result in the use of rumor and hearsay to “smear”\r\ngovernment officials. Certainly it is laudable to try to protect\r\ngovernment employees from baseless charges. But this “protection”\r\nfor the government employees has its drawbacks. Such secrecy has been\r\nused to prevent government employees from gaining access to their own\r\nmedical records which were material to a defense in an ouster action.\r\nIt also shields government personnel administrators from criticism\r\nand thereby encourages arbitrary actions.\r\n\r\nI learned once of a case in which the secrecy surrounding personnel\r\nfiles made it impossible for a woman to find out why she had been\r\ndischarged by the government. I will refer to the woman as Mrs. A,\r\nfor there is no necessity of stirring up more problems for her now if\r\nshe has been able to find a job after being out of work for several\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMrs. A was a woman of about fifty with more than twenty years of\r\nservice with the Civil Service Commission as a shorthand reporter.\r\nShe had had some problems with an employee in the same section\r\nand some disagreement with a supervisor. She was asked to go to\r\nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare for a physical\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nMrs. A took the physical examination and shortly afterwards was\r\nforced to resign. She was given no reason except that something\r\nin the physical examination made her unqualified to continue as a\r\ngovernment employee. Mrs. A went to a private physician and had a\r\nthorough examination to try to find out why she was unqualified to\r\nhold her job with the government. The doctor could find no reason for\r\nher discharge.\r\n\r\nAt this point Mrs. A hired a lawyer. Neither the doctor nor the\r\nlawyer could obtain access to the records of the physical examination\r\ngiven to Mrs. A at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.\r\nThe lawyer hired by Mrs. A found himself tilting with a ghost. He\r\ncould not find out why his client was discharged, and yet he was\r\nfaced with trying to establish proof that whatever was alleged was\r\nnot true.\r\n\r\nI could not believe the story Mrs. A told when she first came to my\r\noffice, but I said I would examine it and see what I could do. It\r\nchecked out in every detail. I was informed at the Health, Education\r\nand Welfare Department that the physical records of all government\r\nemployees were confidential. There were no exceptions. I pointed\r\nout that this confidential status was set up for the purpose of\r\nprotecting the government employees against public intrusion, but\r\nthat it certainly couldn’t be meant to keep a government employee\r\nor her private doctor from examining her records. Officials at\r\nthe Department of Health, Education and Welfare disagreed. I made\r\nrepeated calls to see if I could get the policy changed, but to no\r\navail.\r\n\r\nMrs. A was a little more distressed each time she came by the\r\noffice, for I was unable to interest anyone in her case. She was not\r\nimportant. She was not the center of a big political drama.\r\n\r\nWas it a wrongful discharge? I could not answer the question when it\r\nwas raised by lawyers for committees of Congress. It was possible\r\nthe file would have shown justifiable grounds for the discharge. I\r\ncould only argue that it was wrong to bar this woman, her lawyer,\r\nand her doctor from examination of a file giving the results of her\r\ngovernment health examination.\r\n\r\nDespite the inequity in this case and others similar to it, a general\r\nbelief prevailed in Washington that secrecy on government personnel\r\nfiles and loyalty-security files was an unmixed blessing. The fallacy\r\nof this contention was impressed on me every time I saw Mrs. A. She\r\nwas defeated in appearance, and she was deeply hurt.\r\n\r\nThere is a sharp cruelty in secrecy that results in such injury to\r\nan individual, and there is great damage to our government—and to\r\npeople’s faith in it—when secrecy is used to cover up mismanagement\r\nand corruption. I am gravely concerned over any obstructions put\r\nin the way of congressional committees’ investigating the abuses\r\nof secrecy. Where would we be if Congress had not looked into\r\nsuch nefarious schemes as the Teapot Dome scandals of the Harding\r\nadministration or the tax “fixes” in the Truman administration?\r\n\r\nHave we, a self-governing people, learned anything from these black\r\nmarks on our history? I am afraid that we have not learned enough\r\nyet. I am afraid that the people as a whole, and many persons in the\r\npress and Congress, tend to disregard the danger signs and accept the\r\nself-serving declarations of virtue from their Presidents or other\r\nhigh officials. A few newspapers, a few diligent investigators for\r\ncongressional committees, a few senators and a few congressmen have\r\nhad to take the whole responsibility for breaking through unjustified\r\nsecrecy and uncovering the truth.\r\n\r\nIn my twenty years as a newspaper correspondent I have been\r\nconcerned with this problem of information policies at every level\r\nof government—starting in a local police station, city hall, county\r\ncourthouse, and state capitol. For the past eleven years I have\r\nbeen covering the federal government for the Washington Bureau of\r\nCowles Publications. I have been fortunate to have the freedom\r\nto follow any investigations that interested me, as well as the\r\nenthusiastic support of several newspapers. My position has afforded\r\nme the privilege of a day-to-day acquaintanceship with every major\r\ninvestigation in Washington since 1950.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the Washington cover-up became a major interest to\r\nme in connection with the scandals in the Reconstruction Finance\r\nCorporation (RFC) and the Internal Revenue Service beginning in\r\n1950. The investigations of the RFC were of a reasonably short\r\nduration. The pattern of “political favoritism” in administering this\r\ngovernment loaning agency was ended when W. Stuart Symington, later\r\na United States Senator, was named by President Truman to restore\r\norder. Symington instituted the “fishbowl policy” that brought most\r\nof the RFC operations out in the open.\r\n\r\nThe problems with secrecy in the Internal Revenue Service remained\r\na major news story for more than two years. The Internal Revenue law\r\nprovides that it is unlawful to disclose the information on the tax\r\nreturns submitted by U.S. taxpayers. It was a secrecy established in\r\na specific statute, and the purpose was to protect the privacy of the\r\nfinances of individual taxpayers. However, investigations by Senator\r\nJohn J. Williams, the Delaware Republican, and a House subcommittee,\r\nheaded by Representative Cecil King, the California Democrat, showed\r\nthat the secrecy was used to shield crooked tax agents and tax\r\ncollectors from exposure and prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe Alcohol Tax Unit (ATU), a division of the Internal Revenue\r\nService, had even set up procedures to provide for secret settlements\r\nof criminal law violations. Also, ATU provided secret hearings on\r\napplications for a federal license to wholesale liquor or beer.\r\nA racketeer found it possible to go into a secret hearing, give\r\nperjured testimony, and obtain a license with the help of weak or\r\ncorrupt ATU administrators.\r\n\r\nThe lesson was clear in each case: secrecy corrupts. It allowed\r\ngovernment officials to dispense favors behind closed doors. When\r\ndecisions were secret, there was no need to provide any consistency\r\nin decisions or in penalties. It was impossible for the public or the\r\npress to obtain enough information to register an informed objection.\r\n\r\nDuring fights to open records in the Internal Revenue Service,\r\nI became acquainted with James S. Pope, executive editor of the\r\nLouisville _Courier-Journal_ who was then chairman of the Freedom of\r\nInformation Committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.\r\nWe worked together in forcing the Internal Revenue Service to open\r\ncertain “compromise settlements” of tax cases as well as the ATU\r\nhearings.\r\n\r\nIn exploring these and other information problems, I worked closely\r\nwith the late Harold Cross, former special counsel for the American\r\nSociety of Newspaper Editors; J. Russell Wiggins, executive editor of\r\nthe Washington _Post and Times Herald_; Herbert Brucker, editor of\r\nthe Hartford _Courant_; and V. M. (Red) Newton, managing editor of\r\nthe Tampa _Tribune_.\r\n\r\nWe shared a deep suspicion of government secrecy and also resented\r\nwhat it did in corrupting our system of government. I was privileged\r\nto serve as a member of the national Freedom of Information Committee\r\nof Sigma Delta Chi (the journalism fraternity) and handle the\r\nWashington phase of the reports for Red Newton for a period of more\r\nthan five years. For a longer period I have worked with the American\r\nSociety of Newspaper Editors’ Freedom of Information Committee. I\r\nhave testified before committees of the House and Senate.\r\n\r\nMy testimony before the Moss subcommittee in November 1955 was the\r\nfirst testimony on the scope of the problem of “executive privilege”\r\nadvanced by the Eisenhower administration. I have kept in touch\r\ncontinuously with Representative John Moss, the California Democrat,\r\nand the members of his staff from the time their subcommittee was\r\nestablished. I am particularly indebted to Staff Administrator Sam\r\nArchibald, Staff Consultant Paul Southwick, and staff lawyers John\r\nMitchell and the late Jacob Scher.\r\n\r\nOthers who were particularly helpful and co-operative over these\r\nyears were the late Senator Thomas Hennings (Dem., Mo.); Charles\r\nSlayman, counsel for the Hennings Judiciary Subcommittee; Senator\r\nJohn McClellan (Dem., Ark.), and Robert F. Kennedy, who was his\r\nchief counsel; Herbert Maletz, chief counsel for a House Judiciary\r\nSubcommittee; Representative Porter Hardy (Dem., Va.); John Reddan,\r\nchief counsel for the Hardy Government Operations Subcommittee;\r\nRepresentative F. Edward Hebert (Dem., La.); James Naughton, chief\r\ncounsel for the Fountain Government Operations Subcommittee; and John\r\nCourtney, chief counsel for the Hebert Armed Services Subcommittee;\r\nArthur John Keefe, counsel for the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly\r\nSubcommittee; and Representative George Meader (Rep., Mich.).\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the secrecy problem gained by most of these\r\nlawmakers and lawyers has been understandably confined to their\r\nexperiences with one or two committees, whereas I have had the\r\nopportunity to become aware of the day-to-day activities of nearly\r\nall the committees. For that reason, and because of my alarm at the\r\npublic apathy over government secrecy, I have decided to set the\r\nwhole story down in one place. Most of the story is taken from the\r\nofficial records of congressional committees—the sworn testimony, the\r\ncorrespondence with government agencies, and the official reports\r\nof Senate and House investigators. As much as possible, I have put\r\nit together in chronological, narrative form so that the reader may\r\ndiscover, as I did, how the abuse of government secrecy has spread\r\nand just how vast and serious the scope of it has become. At the end\r\nof the book I will make some recommendations that I hope may serve as\r\na guide to eliminating this serious threat to our democratic form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe First Century\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Indian uprising along the Indiana-Ohio border in 1791 set the\r\nstage for the first investigation by Congress of decisions in the\r\nexecutive branch. President Washington, then in his first term, sent\r\nMajor General Arthur St. Clair into the wilderness to put a stop to\r\nthe raids.\r\n\r\nGeneral St. Clair and his fourteen hundred American soldiers were\r\ncamped along the headwaters of the Wabash River on November 3 when\r\nthey were surprised by the attack of a strong force led by Little\r\nTurtle, chief of the Miami.\r\n\r\nThe Indians killed more than six hundred officers and men and\r\nforced the others to retreat. It was a humiliating defeat, one that\r\nstill ranks among the worst in our history. Congress demanded an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nOn March 27, 1792, the House of Representatives appointed a select\r\ncommittee to inquire into the failure of the St. Clair expedition,\r\nand “to call for such persons, papers, and records, as may be\r\nnecessary to assist their inquiries.” For the first time, the\r\nPresident and his Cabinet were presented with the problem of whether\r\nto make papers and testimony available to Congress.\r\n\r\nPresident Washington called a meeting of his full Cabinet to\r\ndetermine the proper way to proceed, for he was aware that the action\r\ntaken would set a precedent on such matters.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson wrote the following account of the meeting and the\r\nconclusions drawn by the Washington Cabinet:\r\n\r\n“First, that the House was an inquest, and therefore might institute\r\ninquiries. Second, that it might call for papers generally. Third,\r\nthat the Executive ought to communicate such papers as the public\r\ngood would permit, and ought to refuse those, the disclosure of\r\nwhich would injure the public; consequently were to exercise a\r\ndiscretion. Fourth, that neither the committee nor House had a right\r\nto call on the head of a department, who and whose papers were under\r\nthe President alone; but that the committee should instruct their\r\nchairman to move the House to address the President.”\r\n\r\nJefferson also wrote:\r\n\r\n“Hamilton agreed with us in all these points except as to the power\r\nof the House to call on the heads of departments. He observed that\r\nas to his department, the act constituting it had made it subject to\r\nCongress in some points, but he thought himself not so far subject\r\nas to be obliged to produce all the papers they might call for. They\r\nmight demand secrets of a very mischievous nature. (Here I thought\r\nhe began to fear they would go on to examining how far their own\r\nmembers and other persons in the government had been dabbling in\r\nstocks, banks, etc., and that he probably would choose in this case\r\nto deny their power; and in short, he endeavored to place himself\r\nsubject to the House, when the Executive should propose what he did\r\nnot like, and subject to the Executive when the House should propose\r\nanything disagreeable.)... Finally agreed, to speak separately to the\r\nmembers of the committee, and bring them by persuasion into the right\r\nchannel. It was agreed in this case, that there was not a paper which\r\nmight not be properly produced; that if they should desire it, a\r\nclerk should attend with the originals to be verified by themselves.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the Cabinet indicated a need for a discretion to withhold\r\npapers “which would injure the public,” President Washington agreed\r\nthat in the case of the St. Clair expedition “there was not a paper\r\nwhich might not be produced.”\r\n\r\nThere was no withholding by President Washington in this case, and it\r\ncould hardly be regarded seriously as a precedent for any right to\r\narbitrarily refuse executive papers to Congress.\r\n\r\nThere was one other instance in Washington’s administration in\r\nwhich the Congress asked for executive papers. In this case, the\r\nHouse of Representatives asked for the papers and instructions to\r\nUnited States ambassadors who negotiated the Jay treaty. This time\r\nWashington refused to deliver the papers to the House on the specific\r\nconstitutional grounds that the Senate, not the House, is authorized\r\nto advise and consent on treaty matters.\r\n\r\nA Supreme Court case in the administration of President Thomas\r\nJefferson raised the question of whether it was possible for the\r\ncourts to force the Cabinet to perform certain acts required by law.\r\nIn the last hours of the administration of President John Adams a\r\n“midnight appointment” was made of a justice of the peace for the\r\nDistrict of Columbia named William Marbury, a minor Federalist\r\npolitical figure. James Madison, who became the new Secretary of\r\nState in the Jefferson administration, refused to deliver the\r\ncommission to Marbury to complete the appointment process.\r\n\r\nMarbury asked the Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandamus under the\r\nJudiciary Act of 1789 to force Madison to deliver the commission. In\r\nFebruary 1803, Chief Justice John Marshall delivered the opinion of\r\nthe court. First he dealt with the question of whether Madison had\r\na right to refuse to deliver the commission to a properly appointed\r\nofficial. The decision was a rebuke to Secretary of State Madison and\r\nstated: “Is it to be contended that the heads of departments are not\r\namenable to the laws of their country?”\r\n\r\nHowever, the opinion went on to conclude that the Constitution\r\nprovided no method for the Supreme Court to issue writs to force\r\nthe executive action requested. Chief Justice Marshall stated that\r\nthe Judiciary Act providing for a writ was inconsistent with the\r\nConstitution, and that “a law repugnant to the Constitution is void.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Madison was wrong in withholding the commission from\r\nMarbury, the court held that under the Constitution there was no\r\nway to force action. The case did not mean that Madison had a legal\r\nright, but only that Marbury had no remedy. The Marbury appointment\r\nwas in essence a political matter and could only have been countered\r\nindirectly by the impeachment of the President.\r\n\r\nThe specific question of congressional access to executive papers\r\nwas raised in one case in the Jefferson administration. In 1807,\r\nPresident Jefferson was requested to furnish the House “any\r\ninformation in the possession of the Executive” on the allegation\r\nof a conspiracy by Aaron Burr. However, the request specifically\r\nexempted papers “such as he [Jefferson] may deem the public welfare\r\nto require not to be disclosed.”\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson displayed an awareness of the dangers of\r\narbitrary withholding of information by carefully explaining the\r\nnature of the papers he did not deliver. He stated that these papers\r\nincluded matters “chiefly in the form of letters, often containing\r\nsuch a mixture of rumors, conjectures, and suspicions as to render it\r\ndifficult to sift out the real facts and unadvisable to hazard more\r\nthan general outlines, strengthened by concurrent information or the\r\nparticular credibility of the relator.”\r\n\r\nLater, when Aaron Burr was actually tried for treason in Richmond,\r\nChief Justice Marshall issued a subpoena for papers in Jefferson’s\r\ncustody, including a private letter from General James Wilkinson to\r\nJefferson. While Jefferson continued to assert a right to determine\r\nwhich papers he would produce, he did in fact send all the documents\r\nrequested in the subpoena. Also, General Wilkinson appeared at the\r\ntrial and testified fully about his communications with President\r\nJefferson. Chief Justice Marshall’s decision conceded that the\r\nPresident could not be summoned to make a personal appearance before\r\na judicial body because of the nature of his position and the dignity\r\nof his office. Since Jefferson produced all the documents under\r\nsubpoena there was no need for adjudicating the issue of what types\r\nof papers might be withheld. [The trial eventually resulted in a jury\r\nacquittal for Burr.]\r\n\r\nUntil President Jackson’s term there were no significant\r\ncontroversies over requests for information. Jackson was involved in\r\na number of disputes. Although he consistently asserted a right to\r\nwithhold information from Congress, he usually sent the requested\r\ndocuments along with his angry criticism of Congress for making the\r\nrequests.\r\n\r\nA Senate investigation of land frauds in the Jackson administration\r\nresulted in demands for papers dealing with land transactions\r\nconducted by a Jackson appointee. President Jackson refused to\r\ndeliver the papers to Congress, but the resulting cover-up of land\r\nfrauds could hardly be called a precedent worthy to be followed.\r\n\r\nPresident John Tyler was requested to submit to the House of\r\nRepresentatives the reports of Lieutenant Colonel Ethan Allen\r\nHitchcock concerning an investigation of frauds which were alleged\r\nto have been perpetrated on the Cherokee Indians. President Tyler\r\nproduced a part of the information at the time of the request but\r\ndeclined to produce the full investigative reports in 1843. He argued\r\nthat to be effective such investigations must often be confidential.\r\n\r\n“They may result in the collection of truth or falsehood; or they\r\nmay be incomplete, and may require further prosecution,” Tyler said.\r\n“To maintain that the President can exercise no discretion ... would\r\ndeprive him at once of the means of performing one of the most\r\nsalutary duties of his office ... and would render him dependent upon\r\n... [another] branch [of government] in the performance of a duty\r\npurely executive.”\r\n\r\nHowever, in a later message to Congress on the Cherokee Indians\r\nmatter, President Tyler directed that all of the reports be made\r\navailable. He did not acknowledge the right of Congress to command\r\nthe Executive to produce all information. Neither did he claim an\r\nunlimited right for the President to withhold. He declared that there\r\nmust be some discretion left with the President when “the interests\r\nof the country or of individuals” is to be affected by production of\r\nthe records. He enumerated some circumstances in which he felt the\r\nPresident actually had a duty to withhold—as, for example, during a\r\npending law enforcement investigation.\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War there was a flurry of investigations, but these\r\ncaused little conflict. The corrupters in the Grant administration\r\nwere foresighted enough to bring key members of the Republican\r\nCongress into their dishonest schemes as an insurance against\r\nexposure by the committees of Congress.\r\n\r\nA Democratic Congress, elected in 1874, initiated a series of\r\ninvestigations into the War and Treasury Departments to eradicate the\r\ncorruption and to set the stage for the next presidential campaign\r\nin 1876. The frauds were so raw that the feeble efforts to hide\r\nthem were useless. The inquiries disclosed how the government was\r\ndefrauded by a “Whisky Ring” that evaded millions of dollars in taxes\r\non distilled whisky. The “ring” operated with co-operation from\r\nsome Treasury officials as well as from President Grant’s private\r\nsecretary, General Orville E. Babcock.\r\n\r\nAnother congressional investigation of the Grant administration\r\nimplicated Secretary of War W. W. Belknap in widespread graft in the\r\nassignment of trading posts in the Indian territory. He resigned\r\nfrom office in the face of a threat of impeachment, carrying with\r\nhim a presidential letter expressing “regret” that he was leaving\r\ngovernment. President Grant’s letter of “regret” to a man who had\r\nbetrayed a trust set a pattern for Presidents for a long time to\r\ncome. The whole ritual, indeed, has remained the same. First come the\r\naccusations, followed by denials of any improprieties. Then comes the\r\neffort to hide the records. This is followed by the tardy admission\r\nof facts but a denial of illegality, and finally the letter from the\r\nPresident lauding the dishonest public official for his fine service\r\ncoupled with “regretful” acceptance of his resignation.\r\n\r\nThe corruption of the Grant administration is considered by many to\r\nbe the worst blot on the nation’s escutcheon. Republican political\r\nfigures organized a construction firm, the Crédit Mobilier of\r\nAmerica, which was used to divert lavish profits from the building\r\nof the Union Pacific Railway. An American diplomatic figure lent his\r\nname to a huge mine swindle, Navy contracts were for sale, and there\r\nwere wholesale frauds in the custom houses.\r\n\r\nThe widespread scandals of the Grant administration presented no\r\nbasic problem for Congress in obtaining government records because\r\nthe key evidence in these cases could be obtained from sources\r\noutside the executive branch.\r\n\r\nHowever, a problem did develop in 1876 when the Democratic House\r\nsought to obtain testimony and records of financial transactions\r\nof Jay Cooke & Company. Jay Cooke & Company was one of the largest\r\nfinancial institutions of the time, and Jay Cooke was close to the\r\nGrant administration and Republican party politics. When the House\r\nof Representatives discovered that the Secretary of the Treasury had\r\ndeposited large sums of money with a London branch of Jay Cooke &\r\nCompany, it sought to determine whether there was some impropriety\r\ninvolved in the decision to make the deposit.\r\n\r\nIn the course of its investigation, the House issued a subpoena\r\nfor Hallet Kilbourn, who managed some real estate operations for\r\nJay Cooke & Company. Kilbourn refused to produce the documents\r\nsought and argued that the House had no right to investigate private\r\naffairs. The House ordered him arrested for contempt.\r\n\r\nKilbourn was imprisoned by House Sergeant at Arms John Thompson.\r\nKilbourn immediately obtained a court order for his release and then\r\nsued Thompson for false imprisonment. The U. S. Supreme Court held\r\nthat Thompson was liable for damages, and in the decision threw a\r\ndoubt over the right of Congress to punish witnesses for refusing to\r\nanswer questions or produce records.\r\n\r\nThe decision upset the long-standing view that the power of Congress\r\nto investigate was as broad as the almost limitless power of inquiry\r\nof the British Parliament. The U. S. Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n“We are sure no person can be punished for contumacy as a witness of\r\neither House, unless his testimony is required in a matter into which\r\nthat House has jurisdiction to inquire, and we feel equally sure that\r\nneither of these bodies possess the general power of making inquiry\r\ninto private affairs of the citizen.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1927, when the U. S. Supreme Court decided the case\r\nof _McGrain v. Daugherty_, that the right of Congress to compel\r\ntestimony was firmly reaffirmed. In the intervening thirty-five years\r\ntwo Presidents successfully resisted the Congress!\r\n\r\nPresident Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, faced a Republican Senate,\r\nand Theodore Roosevelt, an independent-minded Republican, took\r\ndelight in testing his strength even against a Republican Congress.\r\n\r\nPresident Cleveland in 1886 backed his Attorney General in refusing\r\nto deliver to the Senate some reports dealing with the administration\r\nof the United States District Attorney’s office in the District of\r\nColumbia. The man who had held the office had been suspended, and\r\nCleveland argued that the report on the reasons was the business of\r\nthe executive branch. Because the Kilbourn case had weakened the\r\nposition of Congress, Cleveland was not challenged.\r\n\r\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt refused to allow his Attorney General\r\nto deliver papers to the Senate dealing with the status of\r\ninvestigations involving the U.S. Steel Corporation. The papers\r\nincluded an Attorney General’s opinion on the U.S. Steel Corporation\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nAlthough the papers sought involved a pending case, the Senate\r\ninsisted on pursuing the matter. Herbert K. Smith, head of the Bureau\r\nof Corporations, was summoned and was threatened with contempt\r\nand imprisonment if he failed to produce the documents. President\r\nRoosevelt asked Smith for the papers and, after taking them into\r\nhis possession, informed the Senate the only way they could get the\r\npapers would be by impeaching him. The Senate then dropped the matter.\r\n\r\nThe infamous scandals of the Harding administration renewed the will\r\nof the Congress, and proved for all time the need for Congress to\r\ninvestigate even when a President assures the public that “all is\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTeapot Dome to the Tax Scandals\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Congress completed its investigations of the Harding\r\nadministration scandals, cabinet officers had been found to be\r\ninvolved in the maladministration or corruption. Secretary of Navy\r\nEdwin Denby resigned from office under a barrage of criticism.\r\nAttorney General Harry M. Daugherty, involved in several questionable\r\nfinancial transactions, was indicted on a charge of having accepted\r\na $200,000 payoff in connection with handling of Alien Property\r\nCustodian affairs. Daugherty was acquitted of the criminal charge,\r\nbut reports of Congress established him as corrupt and incompetent\r\nin the handling of his office. Secretary of Interior Albert Fall was\r\nconvicted of accepting a bribe and sent to prison.\r\n\r\nIt was in May 1921, within a year of President Harding’s election,\r\nthat Secretary of Interior Fall persuaded the President and Navy\r\nSecretary Denby to transfer certain naval oil reserves from the Navy\r\nto the Interior Department. Once he got them within his domain, Fall\r\nthen transferred the oil reserves—at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, and Elk\r\nHills, California—to two private oil producers, Harry Sinclair and\r\nE. L. Doheny. The leases were signed secretly, without competitive\r\nbidding, and Secretary of Interior Fall conveniently tossed them into\r\na drawer away from public view. He then proceeded to collect $100,000\r\nfrom Doheny for the Elk Hills transfer, and $300,000 from Sinclair\r\nfor the Teapot Dome transfer.\r\n\r\nMonths later when the Democrats learned of the oil leases they\r\ndemanded explanations and alleged, without substantiation, that the\r\nleases might involve some improprieties. Fall and Denby explained\r\nthat the transfers to the Interior Department and the leasings were\r\n“in the public interest.”\r\n\r\nWhen President Harding put his personal stamp of approval on the\r\nleasing of the oil reserves, public sentiment turned against the\r\ninvestigating Democrats. A big, smiling man with an open face that\r\nseemed to project total integrity, Harding easily gave the impression\r\nthat all was well with the oil reserve transactions. Although events\r\nlater proved that he lacked understanding of the Teapot Dome scandals\r\nas well as many other important matters that took place in his\r\nadministration, his reassurances at this stage were readily accepted\r\nby the public and the press.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Senate investigating committee persisted. Both\r\nSecretary of Interior Fall and Secretary of Navy Denby were called\r\nto testify. It was essential to question these two high-level\r\ngovernment officials to lay the groundwork for the investigation. It\r\nwas essential to explore the conversations between them, as well as\r\nthe personal financial transactions between Fall and the Doheny and\r\nSinclair interests. It was also necessary to explore the opinions and\r\nrecommendations of subordinate officials.\r\n\r\nWithout all of this information, Congress could not have proved the\r\ndishonest use of a government position by Albert Fall. It would\r\nhave been naïve to expect that the Justice Department under Harry\r\nDaugherty would have conducted an investigation that was fair and\r\nobjective, for Daugherty was already mired in his own corruption.\r\n\r\nThe Harding scandals should have demonstrated for all time that the\r\npublic cannot rely on any administration to police itself. Nor can\r\nit rely on the self-serving declarations of a President, however\r\nwell-meaning he may be.\r\n\r\nPresident Harding died on August 2, 1923, a broken and disillusioned\r\nman, still unaware, however, of the full extent of the scandals.\r\nCoolidge’s administration and most of Hoover’s had passed before the\r\ninvestigations were finally completed, the convictions recorded, the\r\nappeals completed, and Fall imprisoned in 1931.\r\n\r\nPresident Coolidge was faced with a request for a list of the\r\ncompanies in which his Secretary of Treasury, Andrew Mellon, had an\r\ninterest. A special Senate investigating committee was studying the\r\nBureau of Internal Revenue and wanted to investigate the tax returns\r\nof firms with which Mellon was associated.\r\n\r\nPresident Coolidge said it would be “detrimental to the public\r\nservice” to reveal the list of Mellon’s business interests and the\r\ntax returns of those firms. With that, the investigation ended.\r\n\r\nAnother request for information was similarly nipped by Hoover. The\r\nSenate Foreign Relations Committee had requested that Secretary of\r\nState Henry L. Stimson produce the contents of telegrams and letters\r\nleading up to the London Conference and the London Treaty. The\r\ncommittee contended it had a special right to such papers because of\r\nthe constitutional prerogative of the Senate in the treaty-making\r\nprocess. Stimson disagreed and President Hoover backed him, arguing\r\nthat in order to maintain friendly relations with other nations,\r\nit would be unwise to give the Senate all of the information on\r\nstatements leading up to the treaty.\r\n\r\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt was favored with a Congress that\r\nwas largely on his side in his first two terms, so that there were\r\nno conflicts over information sought by Congress. Indeed, President\r\nRoosevelt preferred having committees of Congress investigate and\r\ndramatize problems in order to facilitate the passage of various New\r\nDeal measures.\r\n\r\nCongress did run into opposition to requests for information in\r\nRoosevelt’s third term, however. In 1941 Roosevelt rejected requests\r\nfor FBI records and reports, and in 1944 FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover\r\nrefused to testify or to give Congress a copy of a presidential\r\ndirective requiring him, in the interests of national security, to\r\nrefrain from testifying.\r\n\r\nThe President was backed by a ruling from his Attorney General,\r\nFrancis Biddle. In a letter dated January 22, 1944, Biddle claimed\r\nthat communications between the President and the heads of\r\ndepartments were confidential and privileged and not subject to\r\ninquiry by Congress. Another opinion by the Attorney General had\r\npreviously supported President Roosevelt in refusing to make records\r\nof the Bureau of the Budget available to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Roosevelt administration also used the secrecy routine to hamper\r\na House investigation of the Federal Communications Commission\r\n(FCC) in 1943 and 1944. The FCC probe involved the basic charge of\r\npolitical tampering with an independent regulatory agency. There were\r\nindications of improper secret contacts with some commission members\r\nwhile cases were being decided.\r\n\r\nThe Roosevelt administration used every political method available to\r\nimpede the investigations, including the use of friends in Congress\r\nto harass the investigators. Two men who successively held the title\r\nof general counsel—Eugene L. Garey and John J. Sirica—resigned\r\nin the face of the obstructions and harassment. They charged the\r\ninvestigation was being turned into a “whitewash.”\r\n\r\nThe final report of the committee gave the FCC a clean bill of\r\nhealth. However, the minority report filed by Representative Richard\r\nB. Wigglesworth, Republican of Massachusetts, stated: “It has been\r\nimpossible for the committee to conduct anything approaching a\r\nthoroughgoing investigation.”\r\n\r\nCongressman Wigglesworth charged that the committee consistently\r\nacted “to suppress indefinitely alleged unsavory facts said to\r\ninvolve high administration officials and advisers.” He made\r\nreference to the “methods both brutal and shameful” used to force the\r\noriginal chairman of the investigating committee to resign, and to\r\nthe general atmosphere that resulted in the resignations of counsels\r\nGarey and Sirica.\r\n\r\nThe unhealthy conditions, which the House committee had started\r\nto expose, were left to fester, and fourteen years later the full\r\neffects burst on the American public. The investigations of the House\r\nLegislative Oversight Subcommittee in 1957, 1958, and 1959, which\r\nwill be described in a later chapter, disclosed that the successful\r\nblocking of the FCC investigation in 1944 not only allowed bad\r\npractices to continue but thereby encouraged corruption.\r\n\r\nThough President Roosevelt had directed the Secretaries of War and\r\nNavy not to deliver some documents which the FCC investigators had\r\nrequested, his stated reason was simply that it would “not be in\r\nthe public interest.” No broad claims of a constitutional right to\r\nwithhold information were ever invoked. There was no need for them\r\nbecause the cover-up was that ruthless and that effective. Had the\r\nnation not been at war, such a cover-up would likely have caused a\r\nmajor uproar.\r\n\r\nThe end of World War II and the election of a Republican Congress\r\nin 1946, however, brought the Democrats to heel. From the time the\r\nRepublican Congress took control of the committees, the Truman\r\nadministration was in almost constant combat with Congress. The first\r\ndisputes involved the efforts of Republican committees of Congress\r\nto obtain access to FBI records and loyalty files. Later disputes\r\ncentered on efforts to gain access to records of the Bureau of\r\nInternal Revenue and the Justice Department.\r\n\r\nIn 1947, the Republicans were intent on demonstrating that the Truman\r\nadministration was “coddling Communists.” Investigators sought\r\naccess to personnel records and letters dealing with the retention\r\nand promotion of persons who were alleged to be security risks or of\r\nquestionable loyalty.\r\n\r\nPresident Truman issued an executive order barring Congress from\r\naccess to any of the loyalty or security information in the personnel\r\nfiles of the government. He said it was to protect the government\r\nemployees from abuse by committees of Congress. The unrestrained\r\nactivities of some congressional investigators did indeed make the\r\norder seem justifiable to many. However, the Republicans viewed it as\r\na cover-up.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Richard M. Nixon, later the Vice President,\r\nRepresentative Charles Halleck, later the Republican leader, and\r\na dozen other prominent Republicans kept a continuous barrage of\r\ncriticism firing at President Truman.\r\n\r\nSaid Representative Nixon on April 22, 1948:\r\n\r\n“I say that this proposition cannot stand from a constitutional\r\nstandpoint or on the basis of the merits for this very good reason:\r\nThey would mean the President could have arbitrarily issued an\r\nExecutive order in the [Bennett] Meyers case, the Teapot Dome\r\ncase, or any other case denying the Congress of the United States\r\ninformation it needed to conduct an investigation of the Executive\r\ndepartment and the Congress would have no right to question his\r\ndecision.”\r\n\r\nAgain, three years later, Representative Halleck was saying on the\r\nHouse floor:\r\n\r\n“His [Truman’s] censorship order gives every agency and department\r\nof the Government the absolute power to decide what information\r\nshall be kept from them. These agency heads are absolute czars unto\r\nthemselves. When they order the iron curtain down it stays down—a gag\r\non the press and radio of the nation.”\r\n\r\nMost of this initial criticism was aimed at the rather limited\r\npresidential order which barred Congress from the government\r\npersonnel files in the investigations of loyalty and security cases.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Truman administration was reluctant to make records\r\navailable when the Republicans began looking into allegations of\r\nimproper activities and political favoritism in the Reconstruction\r\nFinance Corporation (RFC), in the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and\r\nin the Justice Department, no blanket order was issued refusing\r\ntestimony or records. The allegations were followed first by denials.\r\nThen there was stalling but finally, under the pressure of public\r\nopinion, the records were made available.\r\n\r\nWhat happened specifically was this: Senator John J. Williams, the\r\nDelaware Republican, produced some fairly well documented cases\r\nof favoritism and bungling in the nation’s number one tax agency.\r\nPresident Truman, Secretary of Treasury John Snyder, and Attorney\r\nGeneral J. Howard McGrath all denied there was any widespread laxity\r\nor corruption in the administration of the federal tax laws. Daniel\r\nBolich, the Assistant Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and T. Lamar\r\nCaudle, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Tax Division,\r\nwent before the investigating committees and assured the leaders of\r\nCongress that all was well.\r\n\r\nThe self-serving declarations of the Truman administration did not\r\nsatisfy Senator Williams, however, for they were inconsistent with\r\nmany documented facts he held in his possession. A subcommittee of\r\nthe House Ways and Means Committee was then established to conduct\r\na deeper investigation into the handling of tax cases in the Bureau\r\nof Internal Revenue. Later a subcommittee of the House Judiciary\r\nCommittee was organized to conduct some further examination of the\r\nway the Justice Department handled tax cases as well as other matters.\r\n\r\nBecause tax cases were handled by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, a\r\nbranch of the Treasury Department, and prosecuted by the Justice\r\nDepartment, both departments were involved in the investigation.\r\nTax cases, it was learned, could be fixed in their initial stages\r\nby Internal Revenue agents, or they could be sidetracked at higher\r\nlevels in the Bureau of Internal Revenue; they could be rejected\r\nfor prosecution by the Justice Department in Washington, or kicked\r\naside by the United States District Attorney. There were at least a\r\nhalf-dozen points where a “fix” could take place, and congressional\r\ninvestigations disclosed that some cases were manipulated at almost\r\nall stages.\r\n\r\nWhen at first the Justice Department files were not made available,\r\nthe stalling was recognized for what it was—an effort to hide records\r\nthat might be embarrassing. Newspapers quickly pointed out the\r\ncover-up, and Acting Attorney General Philip B. Perlman was forced to\r\nlay down procedural rules for the committees of Congress to use in\r\nrequesting access to Justice Department files.\r\n\r\nPerlman stated that the Justice Department would not give Congress\r\naccess to open cases, but that closed files would be made available.\r\nHe also said that FBI reports and similar confidential information\r\nwould not be made available. The closed files and the testimony of\r\nhigh officials were nevertheless sufficient to enable Congress to\r\ndocument the record of the mishandling of federal tax investigations\r\nand prosecution. Congress extracted testimony from two cabinet\r\nofficials—Attorney General J. Howard McGrath and Secretary of\r\nTreasury John Snyder. They revealed their conversations and\r\ncommunications with their highest subordinates. Records were produced\r\nshowing the advice, recommendations, and conclusions of investigators\r\nin the Internal Revenue Service and the staff lawyers in the Justice\r\nDepartment. It was clear that some of the cases had not been handled\r\nin the normal manner, and that recommendations from subordinate\r\nofficials were disregarded at some key points.\r\n\r\nOnly through this full examination was it possible to prove\r\nthat some cases were being “fixed” for money or for political\r\nconsiderations. Without the full record on the recommendations\r\nfrom lower officials it would have been impossible to prove that\r\nthe mismanagement was due to anything more than “poor judgment” or\r\nnegligence.\r\n\r\nNeither Attorney General McGrath nor Treasury Secretary Snyder\r\nwas shown to be involved in illegal tampering with any tax cases.\r\nHowever, they had contended that the initial allegations of fraud and\r\nmismanagement were untrue.\r\n\r\nThe investigations by Congress proved that several high officials\r\nwere involved in outright fraud, and a good many more were involved\r\nin gross negligence. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the\r\nAssistant Commissioner, and the chief counsel for the Bureau of\r\nInternal Revenue all resigned under fire.\r\n\r\nA former Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Joseph Nunan, was\r\nsubsequently indicted and convicted on charges of failing to report\r\nlarge amounts of unexplained income. Assistant Commissioner Daniel\r\nBolich was indicted and convicted on charges of failing to report\r\nmore than $200,000 in income, though the conviction was later upset\r\nby the United States Supreme Court on technical grounds. T. Lamar\r\nCaudle, former Assistant Attorney General, in charge of the Tax\r\nDivision, was indicted, convicted, and sent to prison on a criminal\r\ncharge arising out of his mishandling of a federal income tax case.\r\nConvicted with Caudle was Matthew Connelly, appointment secretary for\r\nPresident Truman.\r\n\r\nIn total, dozens of tax officials were ousted from office for\r\nquestionable handling of tax cases, and dozens were indicted and\r\nconvicted on charges of cheating on their own tax returns. The\r\nmismanagement and fraud, which the Truman administration had sought\r\nto deny existed, was more widespread and sordid than most of the\r\ncritics of the Bureau of Internal Revenue had imagined. The damage to\r\nthe integrity of the nation’s tax system was incalculable.\r\n\r\nIf ever a scandal were needed to prove the necessity of a\r\ncongressional review to keep our big federal agencies open and clean,\r\nthe Truman tax scandal was it. The success of their investigations\r\nonly goaded the Republicans to further probing and policing. In\r\ntheir party platform of 1952, the Republicans pledged “to put an end\r\nto corruption, to oust the crooks and grafters, to administer tax\r\nlaws fairly and impartially, and to restore honest government to the\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nWhen he accepted the party’s nomination in Chicago on July 11, 1952,\r\nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower said:\r\n\r\n“Our aims—the aim of this Republican crusade—are clear: to sweep from\r\noffice an Administration which has fastened on every one of us the\r\nwastefulness, the arrogance and corruption in high places, the heavy\r\nburdens and the anxieties which are the bitter fruit of a party too\r\nlong in power.”\r\n\r\n“What the Washington mess must have is the full treatment,” Candidate\r\nEisenhower declared at Atlanta, Ga., on September 2, 1952. “The\r\nonly clean-up that will do the job is the wholesale cleanout of the\r\npolitical bosses in Washington. I pledge you that ... I shall not\r\nrest until the peddlers of privilege and the destroyers of decency\r\nare banished from the nation’s house.”\r\n\r\nTwo days later at Philadelphia, he spoke of the need for an open,\r\nfrank government:\r\n\r\n“We must not minimize the difficulties; neither can we seek with\r\nwords and dollars to make the going look easy when it is tough. There\r\nwill be mistakes, but the mistakes we make will not be doctored\r\nup to look like triumphs. There will be no curtain of evasion, of\r\nsuppression, or double talk between ourselves and the people.”\r\n\r\nAt Des Moines, Iowa, on September 18: “We are going to cast out the\r\ncrooks and their cronies.... And when it comes to casting out the\r\ncrooks and their cronies, I can promise you that we won’t wait for\r\ncongressional prodding and investigations. The prodding this time\r\nwill start from the top. And when we are through, the experts in\r\nshady and shoddy government operations will be on their way back to\r\nthe shadowy haunts, the sub-cellars of American politics from whence\r\nthey came.... The first thing we have to do is get a government that\r\nis honest....”\r\n\r\nAnd at St. Louis, Mo.:\r\n\r\n“... we must take the people, themselves, into our confidence and\r\nthereby, restore their confidence in government. We will keep the\r\npeople informed because an informed people is the keystone in the\r\narch of free government.”\r\n\r\nThe crusade against secrecy and corruption stayed at the forefront of\r\nthe campaign and swept Eisenhower and Nixon into office on November\r\n4. When the electoral vote was tallied, it stood 422 Republicans to\r\n89 Democrats—a genuine mandate to clean up “the mess in Washington.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nArmy-McCarthy—A Claim of Secrecy Unlimited\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of May 17, 1954, the klieg-lighted Senate Caucus\r\nRoom was jammed with spectators. Near the end of the huge table at\r\nthe front of the room, Senator Joseph R. McCarthy hunched over a\r\nmicrophone, reviling the Eisenhower administration. He claimed that\r\nhigh officials of the Eisenhower administration were arbitrarily\r\nsilencing witnesses from the executive branch, and in doing so were\r\npreventing him from defending himself.\r\n\r\nIt was the eighteenth day of the already famous Army-McCarthy\r\nhearings, an exciting political drama that held the attention of an\r\nestimated 20 million television viewers. Over the weeks the Senator\r\nhad sneered at Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens and anyone else who\r\ndisagreed with him. His smirking disrespect and heavy-handed humor\r\nhad already cooled the enthusiasm of many of his followers. Some had\r\neven turned against him. Senator McCarthy, in short, had created\r\nthe worst possible climate in which to make any appeal to fair play\r\nor decency. And yet the Wisconsin Republican was now making such an\r\nappeal and would soon be receiving some sympathetic comment from\r\nDemocratic as well as Republican senators.\r\n\r\nThe point at issue was simple: Should Army Counsel John Adams be\r\nrequired to testify as to conversations at a meeting at the Justice\r\nDepartment on January 21, 1954? Adams had already testified to being\r\npresent on that day with Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr.,\r\nDeputy Attorney General William P. Rogers, Presidential Assistant\r\nSherman Adams, White House Administrative Assistant Gerald D. Morgan,\r\nand United Nations Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge. The meeting had been\r\ncalled to try to find ways to curb Senator McCarthy’s free-wheeling\r\ninvestigation of the loyalty-security program in the Defense\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nWhen, following this testimony on May 14, the Senate committee\r\nmembers asked for information about the conversations, Adams balked.\r\nHe said that “instructions of the Executive Branch” barred him from\r\ntelling of the conversations at that key meeting on January 21.\r\nCommittee members were concerned. How could they obtain the evidence\r\nnecessary to draw a conclusion on the hearings if they were to be\r\nbarred from all “high-level discussions of the Executive Branch”?\r\n\r\nThe Army-McCarthy hearings centered on charges and countercharges\r\ninvolving Army Secretary Stevens, John G. Adams, Defense Department\r\nGeneral Counsel H. Struve Hensel, Senator Joseph McCarthy, Roy M.\r\nCohn, and Francis P. Carr. Cohn was chief counsel for McCarthy’s\r\nPermanent Investigating Subcommittee, and Carr was chief investigator.\r\n\r\nThe Department of the Army alleged that Senator McCarthy, Cohn, and\r\nCarr had improperly used the power of the McCarthy subcommittee\r\nto obtain preferential treatment for Cohn’s pal, Private G. David\r\nSchine. It was contended that the tough and aggressive little Cohn\r\nhad tried to intimidate the Army and Defense officials to get Schine\r\na commission or a special assignment as an assistant to the Secretary\r\nof the Army, or a post in the Central Intelligence Agency. It was\r\nalso charged that Cohn had suggested that Private Schine might be\r\ngiven a special assignment to work with the McCarthy committee. In\r\nfact, Schine had been drafted and after a short time on regular Army\r\nduty was permitted to leave his regular duties to work with Cohn on\r\nthe McCarthy committee investigations.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, Army Secretary Stevens contended that McCarthy and\r\nCohn had launched a vindictive probe of the Army security programs\r\nin reprisal against those who had not co-operated to grant special\r\ntreatment to Private Schine.\r\n\r\nSenator McCarthy countercharged that the Army tried to blackmail\r\nhis investigating subcommittee into dropping its investigation of\r\nthe Army loyalty-security setup by threatening to circulate an\r\nembarrassing report about Cohn and Schine. The Wisconsin Senator\r\ndeclared that his investigation of the Army loyalty-security\r\nprogram was fully justified, and reiterated his charge that Major\r\nIrving Peress had been promoted by the Army despite his record as a\r\n“subversive.” McCarthy did not deny that he had criticized Brigadier\r\nGeneral Ralph Zwicker as a “disgrace” in uniform. And he renewed\r\nhis assault on the Fort Monmouth Missile Research Center as a place\r\nhoneycombed with “Reds.”\r\n\r\nIt was easy to understand why the Eisenhower administration held the\r\nJanuary 21 meeting at the Justice Department to decide how to handle\r\nSenator McCarthy. However, it was not so easy to understand why,\r\nafter testifying there had been such a meeting, Army Counsel Adams\r\nrefused to tell what was said.\r\n\r\nSenator Stuart Symington, the handsome Missouri Democrat, was amazed\r\nthat testimony would be barred on such a crucial meeting. He declared\r\nthat testimony on the January 21 meeting was essential to determine\r\nthe responsibility for the Defense Department’s attempt to stop\r\nSenator Joseph McCarthy.\r\n\r\n“This was a high-level discussion of the executive department, and\r\nthis witness [Adams] has been instructed not to testify as to the\r\ninterchange of views of people at that high-level meeting,” explained\r\nJoseph N. Welch, the gentle-voiced Boston lawyer who was serving as\r\na special counsel for the Army.\r\n\r\n“Does that mean we are going to get the information about low-level\r\ndiscussions but not about high-level discussions?” Senator Symington\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“That is only, sir, what I have been informed,” Welch replied and\r\nthen carefully made it clear he was not passing on the right or wrong\r\nof the policy. “It isn’t a point of what I like. It is a point of\r\nwhat the witness has been instructed.”\r\n\r\nSenator Henry M. Jackson, the Washington Democrat, was no McCarthy\r\nsupporter, but he too was nettled by the instructions given Adams by\r\nDeputy Defense Secretary Robert B. Anderson. Jackson held that if the\r\nDefense Department had any right to refuse to testify on high-level\r\nconversations, then it had waived that right when Adams told of the\r\nJanuary 21 meeting and the participants.\r\n\r\n“I think that maybe this testimony may be embarrassing to the\r\nAdministration, and I do not think that because it is embarrassing to\r\nthe Administration and favorable to Senator McCarthy, that it ought\r\nto be deleted,” Senator Jackson declared.\r\n\r\n“I think this committee should find out now,” Jackson continued,\r\n“whether it [the Administration policy] covers just this conversation\r\nor whether it covers all conversations that went on between the\r\nvarious officials within the Executive Branch of Government ...\r\n[if] we are going to be foreclosed here immediately from asking\r\nany further questions relating to conversations between officials\r\nwithin the Executive Branch. Heretofore, those conversations have\r\nbeen coming in when they have been favorable. Now that they are\r\nunfavorable [to the Administration], are they to be excluded?”\r\n\r\nThe unfairness of allowing favorable testimony by a witness, and\r\nthen arbitrarily cutting off unfavorable testimony was apparent to\r\nmany observers, even through the steam of feeling that surrounded\r\nthe Army-McCarthy hearings. To justify such arbitrary secrecy, the\r\nDefense Department needed all the prestige it could summon.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the problem, it was decided, would be a letter from\r\nPresident Dwight D. Eisenhower to Defense Secretary Charles E.\r\nWilson. It had to be a letter of high tone in which the popular\r\nPresident Eisenhower could convince the public that some great\r\nprinciple was at stake. It had to be general enough to avoid saying\r\njust why John Adams couldn’t testify, but specific enough to give the\r\nimpression that the security of the nation and the foundations of the\r\nConstitution were in danger if John Adams were forced to talk. The\r\nletter drafted between Friday, May 14, and Monday, May 17, carried\r\nthe full impact of the prestige of a highly popular President, but\r\nit obscured temporarily a sweeping assumption of executive power to\r\narbitrarily withhold information (see Appendix A).\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, May 17, John Adams filed the Eisenhower letter\r\nwith the Army-McCarthy committee and a broad new doctrine of\r\n“executive privilege” was born. The glowing phrases about a “proper\r\nseparation of powers between the Executive and Legislative Branches\r\nof the Government,” misled the public and a good many newspaper\r\neditorial writers and columnists, even though it did not fool all the\r\nmembers of the Army-McCarthy committee.\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower’s May 17, 1954, letter stated:\r\n\r\n“Because it is essential to efficient and effective administration\r\nthat employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be\r\ncompletely candid in advising with each other on official matters,\r\nand because it is not in the public interest that any of their\r\nconversations or communications, or any documents or reproductions,\r\nconcerning such advice be disclosed, you will instruct employees\r\nof your Department that in all of their appearances before the\r\nSubcommittee of the Senate Committee on Government Operations\r\nregarding the inquiry now before it they are not to testify to any\r\nsuch conversations or communications or to produce any such documents\r\nor reproductions. This principle must be maintained regardless of who\r\nwould benefit by such disclosure.\r\n\r\n“I direct this action so as to maintain the proper separation\r\nof powers between the Executive and Legislative Branches of the\r\nGovernment in accordance with my responsibilities under the\r\nConstitution. This separation is vital to preclude the exercise of\r\narbitrary power by any branch of Government.”\r\n\r\nThe Eisenhower letter also stated that “throughout our history the\r\nPresident has withheld information whenever he found that what was\r\nsought was confidential or its disclosure would be incompatible with\r\nthe public interest or jeopardize the safety of the Nation.” The\r\nletter gave the impression that from George Washington down, a number\r\nof Presidents had taken action analogous to the silencing of John\r\nAdams.\r\n\r\nHow was the “public interest or the safety of the Nation” to be\r\njeopardized by Army Counsel John Adams’ telling of a meeting on\r\nstrategy to curb Senator McCarthy’s investigations?\r\n\r\nIf this Eisenhower letter was “to preclude the exercise of arbitrary\r\npower by any branch of Government,” then who was to stop the\r\nexecutive branch from such arbitrary silencing of witnesses?\r\n\r\nWere the Army-McCarthy investigating committee and other committees\r\nof Congress to be barred from obtaining information on all\r\n“conversations or communications, or any documents or reproductions,\r\nconcerning advice” within the executive branch?\r\n\r\nThese were the questions that immediately arose in the minds of\r\nSenator Jackson, Senator Symington, and Senator John L. McClellan,\r\nthe Arkansas Democrat. Senator Everett Dirksen, the honey-voiced\r\nIllinois Republican, and Karl Mundt, the South Dakota Republican\r\nwho was serving as chairman, also expressed some concern, although\r\nprivately.\r\n\r\nStern-faced Senator McClellan was not awed by the popularity of\r\nPresident Eisenhower or by the fact that Senator McCarthy was a\r\nhighly unpopular figure at that point. He declared that if the\r\nbarrier to any testimony on the January 21 meeting prevailed, then it\r\nwould be impossible to establish whether John Adams, Army Secretary\r\nStevens, or some higher officials were responsible for directing\r\nactions complained of by Senator McCarthy, Roy Cohn, and Private\r\nSchine.\r\n\r\n“If the committee is going to be left in a dilemma of not knowing\r\nwhether the Secretary [Stevens] is responsible for the action taken\r\nafter that date [January 21], or whether the responsibility is at a\r\nhigher level, then we will never be able to completely discharge our\r\nresponsibility in this proceeding,” Senator McClellan said.\r\n\r\nSenator Jackson expressed the view that the secrecy policy left the\r\ncommittee “in a dilemma of passing on testimony that is incomplete.\r\nI think ... that the Executive Branch is doing a great injustice\r\nto this committee and to all of the principals in this controversy\r\nby exercising the power which the President has, very late in the\r\nproceedings.”\r\n\r\nThere was no question that President Eisenhower’s letter had stalled\r\nthe hearings at a crucial moment. If witnesses could not testify on\r\nan essential point, then there was little more that could be learned.\r\n\r\n“I must admit that I am somewhat at a loss as to know what to do at\r\nthe moment,” Senator McCarthy said. “One of the subjects of this\r\ninquiry is to find out who was responsible for succeeding in calling\r\noff the hearing of Communist infiltration in Government. That the\r\nhearing was called off, no one can question.”\r\n\r\nMcCarthy continued: “At this point, I find out there is no way of\r\never getting at the truth, because we do find that the charges\r\nwere conceived, instigated, at a meeting [of January 21] which was\r\ntestified to by Mr. Adams.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think the President is responsible for this,” the Wisconsin\r\nRepublican said in expressing his views that others had conceived\r\nthe idea of silencing Adams and had merely obtained President\r\nEisenhower’s signature to accomplish their purpose. “I don’t think\r\nhis judgment is that bad.”\r\n\r\n“There is no reason why anyone should be afraid of the facts, of the\r\ntruth, that came out of that meeting,” Senator McCarthy thundered.\r\n“It is a very important meeting. It doesn’t have to do with security\r\nmatters. It doesn’t have to do with national security. It merely has\r\nto do with why these charges were filed.\r\n\r\n“The question is ... how far can the President go? Who all can he\r\norder not to testify? If he can order the Ambassador to the U. N.\r\n[Henry Cabot Lodge] not to testify about something having nothing to\r\ndo with the U. N., but a deliberate smear against my staff, then ...\r\nany President can, by an executive order, keep the facts from the\r\nAmerican people.”\r\n\r\nSenator McCarthy brought up the 1952 campaign in which government\r\nsecrecy had been a key issue: “I do think that someone ... should\r\ncontact the President immediately and point out to him ... that he\r\nand I and many of us campaigned and promised the American people\r\nthat if they would remove our Democrat friends from control of the\r\nGovernment, then we would no longer engage in Government by secrecy,\r\nwhitewash and cover-up.”\r\n\r\nIt was a pathetic plea from a man who by now had completely destroyed\r\nhis public image by his own brutal performance. His voice was\r\nraucous. His heavy beard gave him a rough, almost uncouth appearance\r\ndespite his efforts to modify it by shaving during the noon recess.\r\n\r\nStill, he hammered on. “I think that these facts should be brought\r\nto the President because the American people will not stand for such\r\nas this, Mr. Chairman. They will not stand for a cover-up halfway\r\nthrough a hearing.”\r\n\r\nSeldom had there been more right on the side of McCarthy, but seldom\r\nhad there been fewer people on his side. Many people who at first had\r\nbeen inclined to approve Joe McCarthy as “doing some good against\r\nthe Communists,” had been antagonized by his television image. Many\r\neditorial pages of a press that was normally much more objective had\r\ndeveloped an attitude that anything that is bad for Joe McCarthy is\r\ngood for the country.\r\n\r\nPublic sentiment against him was so strong that I did not believe\r\nit could have been changed to his favor—even if the committee had\r\nsucceeded in eliciting testimony on the January 21, 1954, meeting\r\nand no matter how embarrassing it might have been to the Eisenhower\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThere remained, nevertheless, the possibility that the Eisenhower\r\nletter could be used again. I was shocked at the wording of it.\r\nOn the face of it, it seemed to extend the claim of “executive\r\nprivilege” to prohibit Congress the access to _any_ records or\r\ntestimony that might involve communications within the executive\r\nbranch. The letter was a directive with regard to excluding testimony\r\nin one hearing—the Army-McCarthy hearing. However, it was certainly\r\nbroad enough that the Defense Department could use it to block any\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if an administration could successfully block any probe of\r\nhigh-level discussions in the Defense establishment, why couldn’t\r\nit use that same “executive privilege” to block any investigation\r\nin any other executive agency? The thought disturbed me. The Teapot\r\nDome scandals of the Harding administration could have been buried\r\nif those officials had applied even the mildest interpretation of\r\n“executive privilege” set down by President Eisenhower in the May 17\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nIf cabinet officers and subordinate officials had refused to testify\r\nabout the Teapot Dome affair on grounds of “confidential executive\r\ncommunications,” it could have stifled the entire investigation by\r\nSenator Thomas Walsh, the Montana Democrat. Under the “executive\r\nprivilege” theory, Secretary of Navy Edwin Denby and Secretary of\r\nInterior Albert B. Fall could have refused to give testimony or\r\nproduce records of events leading up to the leasing of the Teapot\r\nDome oil reserves. Fall’s crimes might never have been uncovered, and\r\nhe would have avoided the exposure and conviction.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the tax scandals of the Truman administration could have\r\nbeen buried by claiming that all papers except those involving\r\nfinal decisions were “confidential executive communications.” It\r\nhad been vital to learn the nature of advice and recommendations of\r\nboth high-level and low-level officials on settlements of huge tax\r\ncases. Attorney General J. Howard McGrath could have claimed that his\r\nconversations with T. Lamar Caudle, the Assistant Attorney General in\r\ncharge of the Tax Division, were “confidential executive business.”\r\n\r\nCaudle and White House Aide Matthew Connelly could have claimed that\r\ntheir communications were “confidential executive business.” As it\r\nwas, the Caudle-Connelly communications were actually used as the\r\nbasis of criminal charges on which Caudle and Connelly were convicted\r\nand sent to prison. A number of other officials of the Internal\r\nRevenue Service were convicted on charges arising out of revelation\r\nof the “advice and recommendations” they gave that were part of a\r\nhuge tax “fix” operation.\r\n\r\nI talked to several members of the Army-McCarthy committee, and\r\nwith several of my newspaper colleagues, Democratic and Republican\r\nsenators alike were disturbed at this seemingly limitless claim for\r\n“executive privilege.” They hoped that the Eisenhower administration\r\nhad written the letter for just this one hearing and had used the\r\nbroad language merely to avoid an impression that Senator McCarthy\r\nwas being singled out for special treatment. Among the newspaper\r\nreporters the attitude was that Joe McCarthy was getting about what\r\nhe had coming to him; there was little concern over what use might be\r\nmade of the precedent in other investigations.\r\n\r\nMany of the reporters had been misled by a memorandum that\r\naccompanied the Eisenhower letter. It said, in effect, that President\r\nEisenhower was doing no more than George Washington and many other\r\nPresidents had done. By invoking such names as George Washington and\r\nThomas Jefferson, the memorandum made it possible to pass off the\r\nEisenhower letter as a mere “clarification” of an old and settled\r\nprinciple. A close reading of “the precedents” disclosed in fact\r\nthat President Washington actually _opposed_ withholding information\r\nfrom Congress. (See Chapter I.) He once refused to deliver treaty\r\npapers to the House but only because the Senate, not the House, had\r\njurisdiction to ratify treaties.\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson had taken papers into his personal custody in\r\nconnection with the Aaron Burr case, and thus defied the federal\r\ncourt by declaring that the only way the papers could be reached\r\nwould be by impeaching him. He was right. The law is quite settled\r\non this point; neither the courts nor the Congress can compel the\r\nPresident to testify or produce personal letters, papers, and\r\nmemorandums. President Jefferson eventually did send the documents\r\nsubpoenaed by Chief Justice Marshall. But even if Jefferson had\r\nrefused to produce these documents, it would hardly seem to be an\r\nadequate reason for allowing a lawyer for the Army Department to\r\nrefuse to testify about a meeting with a cabinet officer and several\r\nWhite House aides.\r\n\r\nThe late Ed Milne, of the Washington Bureau of the Providence\r\n_Journal_, shared my concern. He and I each wrote stories\r\ndemonstrating how the Truman tax scandals and the Harding Teapot\r\nDome scandals could have been hidden forever if “executive privilege”\r\nhad barred testimony of all high-level conversations.\r\n\r\nWe also reminded our readers of the Republican reaction to the\r\nducking and evasion of the Truman administration between 1946 and\r\n1952. Senator Homer Ferguson, the Michigan Republican, was chairman\r\nof one of the committees that investigated the Truman administration\r\nin the late 1940s. His chief counsel at the time was William P.\r\nRogers, who later became Eisenhower’s Attorney General and a chief\r\nadvocate of the ultimate in executive secrecy. Only a year before\r\nEisenhower’s election (September 27, 1951), Ferguson spoke out\r\nbluntly on the issue of suppression of facts by the executive\r\ndepartments: “It may be said that this practice of suppressing\r\ninformation in the executive department got its big start back in\r\nMarch, 1948. The Senator from Michigan [himself] was then chairman of\r\nthe Senate Investigations Subcommittee and was investigating things\r\nthat could be embarrassing to the administration. The subject of the\r\ninvestigation was the operation of the Government’s loyalty program,\r\nrevolving around the case of William Remington.”\r\n\r\nSenator Ferguson continued: “An executive order was issued, placing\r\ncertain files under the direct and exclusive jurisdiction of the\r\nPresident. On occasion files were taken to the White House in order\r\nthat they could not be subpoenaed. In the course of our hearings, an\r\nadmiral was able to tell the Senator from Michigan, off the record,\r\nthe fact that because of an order by the President of the United\r\nStates he was not permitted to testify.”\r\n\r\nAs I have shown (in Chapter III), the Truman administration did\r\ntry to hide embarrassing facts from Congress. President Truman\r\nissued an executive order placing certain personnel files under a\r\nsecrecy blanket, and on some occasions he ordered files delivered\r\nto his personal custody at the White House so they could not be\r\nreached by subpoena. His administration stalled investigations of\r\nflagrant crimes for months. But President Truman never asserted any\r\nconstitutional right by which all high-level officials could claim an\r\n“executive privilege” to refuse to testify or produce records.\r\n\r\nThe persistent, hard-hitting inquiries of Committee Counsel William\r\nP. Rogers made the Truman administration so frantic in 1948 and 1949\r\nthat a staff lawyer in the Justice Department was asked to prepare\r\na memorandum on the precedents set by earlier Presidents who had\r\nwithheld information from Congress. However, that memorandum was\r\nregarded as too insubstantial to use. The Truman administration\r\nrelied instead on ducking and dodging to avoid embarrassment. It\r\nsensed correctly that the press and the public would have been\r\noutraged if it had tried to pull down a total secrecy curtain in\r\nthe midst of investigations of the five percenters, the influence\r\npeddlers, and the loyalty cases.\r\n\r\nWhat Truman would not do, however, the highly popular President\r\nEisenhower did do. Ironically, his May 17 letter caused hardly a\r\nripple of criticism. On the contrary, most editorial pages praised\r\nPresident Eisenhower for expressing some fine new theory on the U. S.\r\nConstitution or wrote off the letter as an historically unimportant,\r\none-shot claim of secrecy.\r\n\r\nI called one editor friend the day after such an approving editorial\r\nappeared, and commented that the Eisenhower doctrine of “executive\r\nprivilege” could bar Congress from practically any executive papers\r\ncontaining “opinions, advice or recommendations.”\r\n\r\n“This will set the ‘Freedom of Information’ cause back fifty years,\r\nif it is not criticized and stopped now,” I said.\r\n\r\nMy editor friend said he thought that there might have been some\r\nloyalty file discussed at the January 21 meeting, and that this would\r\nbe a justification for refusing testimony.\r\n\r\nI told him that no one had claimed that loyalty files were discussed,\r\nand that if this had been the reason for the secrecy then it should\r\nhave been stated. Also, I pointed out that while discussion of a\r\nloyalty file might give some justifications for limiting testimony,\r\nthe limitation should only cover that subject and not the whole\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nThe editor agreed with me that the broad language of the Eisenhower\r\nletter constituted a dangerous precedent. But he didn’t believe that\r\nany administration would ever try to invoke the total arbitrary\r\n“executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nJust how wrong events would prove him to be was not then easy to\r\npredict. Indeed, the whole story of the Army-McCarthy hearings had\r\nby this time taken second news billing to the United States Supreme\r\nCourt ruling on school segregation. The unanimous segregation\r\ndecision came out on May 17, 1954—the same date as the Eisenhower\r\nletter to Wilson. That segregation decision now dominated discussions\r\nof constitutional law. And the few persons who did stop to think\r\nabout the inherent threat in the broad use of secrecy could hardly\r\nget emotional about it—as long as the only victims appeared to be\r\nSenator McCarthy and his little knot of followers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nAnother Blow at Senator Joe\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Eisenhower administration took office in January 1953, I\r\nhad had high hopes that arbitrary government secrecy would be ended.\r\nAs a candidate, the President had talked much of his interest in\r\nopen government and had pledged to make all but national security\r\ninformation available to the public. So had the Vice President,\r\nRichard M. Nixon.\r\n\r\nAs late as November 6, 1953, Attorney General Herbert Brownell,\r\nJr., was continuing to stress the Republican party’s interest in\r\neliminating secrecy policies of the Truman administration. In\r\nChicago, before a convention of Associated Press Managing Editors,\r\nBrownell said he was “very much aware of the great importance of\r\nseeing to it that the obstacles to the free flow of information are\r\nkept to an absolute minimum.\r\n\r\n“I would like to call attention to some of the procedures which\r\nwe established,” Brownell said. “At the very outset of the new\r\nAdministration, we provided that any pardons or commutations of\r\nsentence shall be a matter of public record. Throughout the prior\r\nAdministration, these executive actions were taken secretly, for\r\npolitical purposes and over the objection of the Office of the Pardon\r\nAttorney.\r\n\r\n“We also started the policy of making a matter of public record\r\nmatters which our predecessors buried in secrecy, such as settlements\r\nof all types of cases which we handle and involve monetary\r\nconsiderations, such as tax claims, damage suits and Alien Property\r\nsettlements. We do not contend that we have achieved perfection in\r\nour efforts to provide a full flow of information. But we are working\r\non it and each day find new ways to do our part.”\r\n\r\nAt this same meeting, Attorney General Brownell announced that\r\nPresident Eisenhower was revoking a much criticized executive order\r\nby President Truman dealing with defense information. He said\r\nPresident Eisenhower was issuing a new order which “attains the\r\nrequired balance between the need to protect certain types of defense\r\ninformation, and the need for keeping the citizens of a republic as\r\nfully informed as possible concerning what their government is doing.\r\n\r\n“President Eisenhower considers the free flow of information from\r\nthe Government to the people to be basic to the good health of the\r\nNation,” Brownell told the editors. He declared that under the\r\nTruman administration there “was a tendency to follow the dangerous\r\npolicy heretofore used by dictator nations of authorizing government\r\nofficials to use the term ‘National Security’ indiscriminately, and\r\nthereby throw a veil of secrecy over many items which historically\r\nhave been open to the public in this country.”\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General said he viewed the new Republican policy as\r\nan opportunity to “demonstrate to all the world the vivid contrast\r\nbetween our system of government, which believes in and practices\r\nfreedom of the press, and the Communist system, which regards the\r\nconcept of freedom of information as a threat to the continuance of\r\nits tyrannical rule.”\r\n\r\nSuch attitudes in November 1953 were difficult to reconcile with\r\nthose of May 1954, when the same Attorney General was helping fashion\r\na policy that was more devastating to a free flow of information\r\nthan simply refusing to give information to the press. The May 17,\r\n1954, letter from President Eisenhower to the Defense Department\r\nsaid in essence that any high officials of the Defense establishment\r\nmight refuse to produce records or testify even when subpoenaed by a\r\nproperly constituted congressional committee that was acting within\r\nits jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe Army-McCarthy hearings that had given rise to the famous letter\r\nended on June 17, 1954. However, it was not necessary to wait for\r\nthe official reports made public on October 30, 1954, to know that\r\nSenator McCarthy was finished as a political power—and that the\r\nadministration would use the “executive privilege” precedent again.\r\n\r\nAs an aftermath of the Army-McCarthy hearings, a charge was filed\r\nthat Senator McCarthy had conducted himself in a manner “unbecoming\r\na member of the United States Senate.” And on August 2, 1954, the U.\r\nS. Senate decided by the overwhelming vote of 75 to 12 to investigate\r\nSenator McCarthy’s conduct.\r\n\r\nSenator Arthur V. Watkins, a Utah Republican, was named chairman of\r\nthe select McCarthy Censure Committee to determine recommendations\r\non Senator McCarthy’s conduct. In barely more than a month Chairman\r\nWatkins ran smack into a roadblock of “executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nThe subject of inquiry was Senator McCarthy’s severe tongue lashing\r\nof Brigadier General Ralph Zwicker, of Camp Kilmer, N. J. Major\r\nGeneral Kirke B. Lawton, a former commanding general of Fort\r\nMonmouth, N. J., refused to testify about conversations with General\r\nZwicker. He claimed “executive privilege” under the May 17, 1954,\r\nletter from President Eisenhower.\r\n\r\nEdward Bennett Williams, who was serving as counsel for Senator\r\nMcCarthy, questioned the applicability of the May 17 letter: “Don’t\r\nyou know, General, that order of May 17, 1954, referred only to the\r\nGovernment Operations Committee and the hearing then in session which\r\nwas commonly known as the Army-McCarthy hearing?”\r\n\r\nGeneral Lawton replied that he had been advised that the May 17\r\nletter “not only applied to the so-called Mundt committee [the\r\nSpecial Committee for the Army-McCarthy hearings] but it applies to\r\nthis or any other.”\r\n\r\nChairman Watkins excused General Lawton and wrote Defense Secretary\r\nCharles E. Wilson asking clarification. Defense Secretary Wilson\r\nreplied that Generals Lawton and Zwicker would be allowed to testify\r\nand produce documents unless their action would be “in violation of\r\nnational security regulations or a violation of the President’s order\r\nof May 17, 1954.”\r\n\r\nThere could be little doubt now that the Defense Department intended\r\nto make the May 17, 1954, letter a part of its basic doctrine with\r\nall of the great blanket of secrecy that this would provide. I was\r\nnow more concerned than ever, for I had hoped that the May 17 letter\r\nwas the one-shot secrecy claim that so many of my colleagues thought\r\nit was. But again the name of Joe McCarthy was mixed up in the\r\ninvestigation, and in 1954 it would have been difficult to get any\r\ncool thinking on a subject that remotely touched on the controversial\r\nWisconsin Republican.\r\n\r\nStill, I couldn’t help worrying that the new and expanded doctrine\r\nof “executive privilege” was just too convenient a cover for those\r\nwho wished to hide their activities from Congress, the press, or the\r\npublic. It could be used by the incompetent as well as the corrupt.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of an “inherent right” of persons in the executive\r\ndepartments to refuse testimony or documents threatened our whole\r\nsystem of government. It seemed a naked claim of an authority\r\nfor unlimited secrecy, without regard for laws or the spirit of\r\na democracy. By claiming a right to withhold all information on\r\nopinions, conclusions, recommendations, or suggestions, this doctrine\r\ncould allow the secrecy blanket to be dropped over virtually every\r\ndocument in most agencies, for there are few governmental documents\r\nthat do not contain some opinions or suggestions. It carried within\r\nit, in short, the seeds of dictatorship.\r\n\r\nIt seemed strange to me that this doctrine would be set forth in\r\nthe administration of a President who would be regarded as one\r\nof the mildest Chief Executives, and certainly one of the least\r\ninclined toward dictatorial action. I was not worried that President\r\nEisenhower would try to use it as a tool for totalitarianism.\r\nBut with this doctrine in force a man who was inclined toward\r\ntotalitarian methods might readily administer the laws as he pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSecrecy Fix on Dixon and Yates\r\n\r\n\r\nNot until the summer of 1955 did it become apparent that the May 17,\r\n1954, Eisenhower letter would be used on matters unrelated to Senator\r\nJoseph R. McCarthy. Throughout the fall and winter of 1954, I spoke\r\nand wrote about the potential danger of “executive privilege” as it\r\nhad been applied in the Army-McCarthy hearings and in the McCarthy\r\ncensure hearings. A few persons saw it my way. But the general\r\ntendency to believe that the letter was written solely to deal with\r\nSenator McCarthy held fast, and a general faith prevailed that the\r\nEisenhower administration would not use it to cover up mistakes,\r\ncorruption, or improprieties.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly, in June 1955, the White House reinvoked the letter\r\nas justification for refusing to make records available to a Senate\r\ncommittee investigating the Dixon-Yates contract.\r\n\r\nFirst, Budget Director Rowland R. Hughes used “executive privilege”\r\nto conceal testimony and documents requested by Senator Estes\r\nKefauver, the Tennessee Democrat in charge of the investigation.\r\n\r\nThen J. Sinclair Armstrong, the chairman of the Securities and\r\nExchange Commission, used “executive privilege” to justify his\r\nrefusal to disclose conversations with Presidential Assistant Sherman\r\nAdams relative to postponing a hearing on Dixon-Yates financing.\r\n\r\nAlso, Sherman Adams claimed the “privilege” not to be required to\r\ntestify about his talks with Armstrong or about other activity in the\r\nDixon-Yates contract development.\r\n\r\nAt last a few of the Democrats who had been only too glad to see\r\n“executive privilege” invoked against Senator McCarthy opened their\r\neyes. The realization of the danger dawned too late, however, for it\r\nwould take more than a few weeks to upset a precedent that only a\r\nyear earlier had been generally viewed as praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nWhile the Army-McCarthy hearings and the McCarthy censure affair\r\ndominated the news, top-level officials in the Eisenhower\r\nadministration had been quietly at work arranging for the Mississippi\r\nValley Generating Company to furnish 600,000 kilowatts of electricity\r\nto the Tennessee Valley Authority. The Mississippi Valley Generating\r\nCompany contract ultimately became known as the “Dixon-Yates”\r\ncontract because of the two men responsible for its creation. They\r\nwere Edgar H. Dixon, president of Middle South Utilities, Inc., and\r\nEugene A. Yates, chairman of the board of The Southern Company. Both\r\nfirms act as holding companies for utilities operating in Arkansas,\r\nGeorgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Dixon and Yates joined\r\nforces to create the Mississippi Valley Generating Company, an\r\noperating subsidiary in West Memphis, Ark. The Dixon-Yates contract\r\nwas reported to be for the purpose of replacing power in the\r\nTennessee Valley Authority area that was used by the Atomic Energy\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nLewis L. Strauss, then chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission\r\n(AEC), and Joseph Dodge, then Director of the Budget, were active in\r\npushing this contract. Chairman Strauss pushed it despite the fact\r\nthat a majority of the Atomic Energy Commissioners were opposed to\r\nsuch a contract on grounds there was no Atomic Energy Commission\r\ninstallation near West Memphis, Ark., and the power was to be used in\r\nMemphis, Tenn.\r\n\r\nThe Eisenhower administration had opposed the Tennessee Valley\r\nAuthority proposal to build a steam plant at Fulton, Tenn., with\r\na capacity of 500,000 kilowatts to provide for the power needs of\r\nMemphis, plus a surplus for industrial expansion. Budget Director\r\nDodge opposed the Fulton steam plant and axed the 90 million dollars\r\nrequested from the budget in 1953. Gordon Clapp, at that time\r\nchairman of the TVA, then asked that to offset the loss of the Fulton\r\nsteam plant the AEC consumption of TVA power be cut sharply. It was\r\nat this point that Budget Director Dodge turned to the AEC in an\r\neffort to get that agency to find ways to obtain power from a private\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe Dixon-Yates contract idea developed over a period of months in\r\n1953 and early 1954. Dozens of conferences were held in which one\r\nof the important figures was Adolphe Wenzell, a vice president and\r\ndirector of the First Boston Corporation. Wenzell was an engineer\r\nand an expert in the cost of construction of public utility plants.\r\nFrom May 20, 1953, to September 3, 1953, he made studies and issued\r\nreports on TVA power plant costs. In January 1954, Rowland R.\r\nHughes, then Deputy Director of the Budget, asked Wenzell to assist\r\nthe Budget Bureau on the Dixon-Yates contract. Wenzell agreed and,\r\nuntil April 10, 1954, continued to participate in the Dixon-Yates\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\nWenzell continued to draw his salary from First Boston Corporation,\r\nand received travel costs and a per diem allowance from the\r\ngovernment for his services for the Budget Bureau. Since First Boston\r\nCorporation was slated to be underwriter of the Mississippi Valley\r\nGenerating Company, a question was raised by his associates about\r\nthe propriety of Wenzell’s services to the Budget Bureau and to\r\nFirst Boston—a firm that had a pecuniary interest in the Dixon-Yates\r\ncontract agreement.\r\n\r\nAs the Dixon-Yates contract moved toward completion, a lawyer for the\r\nlaw firm of Sullivan & Cromwell told Wenzell that before First Boston\r\nshould take part in the financing for Dixon-Yates, Wenzell “should\r\nmake clear that he had severed his entire relations with the Bureau\r\nof the Budget.”\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1954, a few complaints were raised about the\r\nDixon-Yates contract. There was also opposition to the Dixon-Yates\r\ncontract within the Tennessee Valley Authority as well as by a\r\nmajority of the Atomic Energy Commissioners. But on June 16, 1954,\r\nRowland Hughes, by then promoted to Director of the Budget, wrote to\r\nthe Atomic Energy Commission:\r\n\r\n“The President has asked me to instruct the Atomic Energy Commission\r\nto proceed with negotiations with the sponsors of the proposal\r\nmade by Messrs. Dixon and Yates with a view of signing a definite\r\ncontract.”\r\n\r\nThe contract was signed, and in the following weeks the number of\r\nDemocratic complaints mounted. The complaints hit a number of points.\r\nThe Democrats contended that the Dixon-Yates contract could cost the\r\ngovernment from 107 million to 120 million dollars over a period of\r\ntwenty-five years, but that in the end the government wouldn’t own\r\nthe plant. This was compared to the 90 million cost for the Fulton\r\nsteam plant which the TVA wanted to construct.\r\n\r\nThe debate revolved largely around the question of private versus\r\npublic power (or TVA). Many Democrats held that the Eisenhower\r\nadministration was allowing the public treasury to be milked by Big\r\nBusiness in the same fashion the Harding administration had permitted\r\nthe exploitation of Navy oil reserves in the Teapot Dome scandals.\r\n\r\nDemocratic National Chairman Stephen Mitchell hit a sensitive nerve\r\nin early August 1954 when he implied that President Eisenhower had\r\ndirect responsibility for the Dixon-Yates contract. He charged that\r\none of President Eisenhower’s golfing associates was a director of\r\nThe Southern Company, one of the two holding companies that had\r\nestablished the Mississippi Valley Generating Company. Mitchell’s\r\noffice identified the man as Bobby Jones, former amateur and\r\nprofessional golfing champion. No evidence was ever produced to\r\nsupport the insinuation that Jones influenced Dixon-Yates decisions.\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower was furious that his associations would be\r\nsubject to such charges, and in his August 17, 1954, press conference\r\nhe offered to disclose all the events leading up to the Dixon-Yates\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\n“Any one of you here present might singly or in an investigation\r\ngroup go to the Bureau of the Budget, or to the Chief of the Atomic\r\nEnergy Commission, and get the complete record from the inception of\r\nthe idea [of the Dixon-Yates contract] to this very minute, and it is\r\nall yours.”\r\n\r\nFour days later, on August 21, 1954, the Atomic Energy Commission\r\nreleased what was purported to be a full chronology of all events in\r\nthe development of the Dixon-Yates contract. The names of Wenzell and\r\nPaul Miller, assistant vice president of First Boston Corporation,\r\nhad appeared in an original draft. However, the names of both of\r\nthese First Boston Corporation officials—Wenzell and Miller—were\r\neliminated from the chronology that was given to the press.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, it appeared that President Eisenhower had met charges\r\nof improper activity with a frank and open report on the whole record\r\nof the Dixon-Yates contract. Not until February 18, 1955, did anyone\r\ncharge that the chronology was not a full truthful report. On that\r\nday, Senator Lister Hill, the Alabama Democrat, made a Senate speech\r\nin which he charged Wenzell with a dual role in the Dixon-Yates\r\nnegotiations. He questioned the propriety of Wenzell’s being a\r\nfinancial adviser to Dixon-Yates while at the same time serving as an\r\nadviser to the United States Government on the Dixon-Yates contract.\r\n\r\nSpokesmen for the Eisenhower administration such as Budget Director\r\nRowland R. Hughes denied there was any dual role by Wenzell in the\r\nDixon-Yates contract. As late as June 27, 1955, Budget Director\r\nHughes testified before a Senate committee that “I was told it was\r\nnot true.” He said he didn’t know that First Boston had anything to\r\ndo with the financing of Dixon-Yates.\r\n\r\nThe speech by Senator Hill caused understandable concern in the White\r\nHouse and among the top officials of the First Boston Corporation.\r\nRevelation of a “conflict of interest” could spoil the entire\r\n107-million-dollar contract and its profits for First Boston. It\r\ncould undo what President Eisenhower and many top subordinates deemed\r\nan important block to the spread of the Tennessee Valley Authority.\r\n\r\nOf immediate importance was a 6.5-million-dollar appropriation\r\nslated to go to the House of Representatives on June 13, 1955.\r\nThe appropriation was for a transmission line from the Tennessee\r\nValley Authority to the point where it would pick up power from\r\nthe Mississippi Valley Generating Company in the middle of the\r\nMississippi River.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, 1955, Sherman Adams telephoned to J. Sinclair Armstrong,\r\nchairman of the Securities Exchange Commission. He requested that the\r\nSEC hold up hearings on debt financing of the Dixon-Yates contract\r\nuntil after the House had finished work on the 6.5-million-dollar\r\nappropriation. Wenzell was among the witnesses scheduled to testify\r\nbefore the SEC, and testimony on Wenzell’s full role in Dixon-Yates\r\ncould have had a devastating impact on the appropriation. The\r\nhearings were postponed.\r\n\r\nFinally, on June 28, 1955, Budget Director Hughes revealed that the\r\nEisenhower administration was going to try to pull down the secrecy\r\ncurtain on the investigation of Dixon-Yates. The claim of “executive\r\nprivilege” was to be the vehicle.\r\n\r\nHughes was being questioned by Senator Estes Kefauver, regarding a\r\nrequest for the opportunity to examine all memoranda, documents, and\r\nreports pertinent to the Dixon-Yates contract. By this time it was\r\nabundantly clear to the Kefauver subcommittee that the chronology\r\nreleased on August 21, 1954, was intentionally incomplete.\r\n\r\nIndirectly Hughes moved to “executive privilege.”\r\n\r\n“As pointed out to you,” he told Senator Kefauver, “we operate under\r\nthe President’s general instructions with regard to interoffice and\r\nintraoffice staff material, that such material is not to be made\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n“All documents which involve final decisions of public policy have\r\nof course already been made public,” Hughes said in an effort to\r\ngive the impression that the administration had complied with the\r\nPresident’s pledge of frankness. “You [Kefauver] pointed out that\r\nyou interpreted the President’s statement at a press conference last\r\nfall to indicate that they [the “executive privilege” claims] did not\r\napply to this case. I have checked on this matter and I am authorized\r\nby the President to state that his general instructions stand but\r\nthat we, of course, stand on the decision to make every pertinent\r\npaper or document that can be made public under this ruling available\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nHughes was trying to give an impression of frankness, while at the\r\nsame time reserving to the administration the right to withhold any\r\nDixon-Yates information they wished to regard as “interoffice and\r\nintraoffice staff material.” Hughes continued:\r\n\r\n“A quick review of our files last night disclosed no other papers or\r\ndocuments to be added to the somewhat voluminous releases already\r\nmade, but we shall make a full and careful search in the next few\r\ndays to confirm this or to pick out material, if any, which should be\r\nadded to that previously released.”\r\n\r\nHughes had left the Eisenhower administration an “out” on any\r\nomissions of material. Next he sought to absolve Wenzell from any\r\nconnection with the Dixon-Yates contract.\r\n\r\n“We have also reviewed the report which Mr. Wenzell made as an\r\nadviser in September, 1953, and find that that had nothing to do\r\nwith the Dixon-Yates contract and, as a confidential document under\r\nthe general ruling [of “executive privilege”], therefore cannot be\r\nmade available to your committee.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Hughes concluded with a promise to “co-operate where we can\r\ndo so properly,” he made it clear the Eisenhower administration was\r\nstill going to use the “executive privilege” claim to secrecy if it\r\nwanted to refuse testimony or records.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, high administration officials had deleted\r\ninformation, twisted the record, engaged in half truths and full\r\ndeception to obscure the story of the Dixon-Yates contract. Now they\r\nwere seeking to use the name of President Eisenhower, and give the\r\nimpression that some constitutional principle was involved in hiding\r\nthe records.\r\n\r\nSenator Kefauver took to the Senate floor to lash out at\r\nthe concealment of records and testimony in the Dixon-Yates\r\ninvestigation. At the presidential press conference on June 30, 1955,\r\nFrank Van De Linden, of the Nashville _Banner_, forced the issue with\r\nPresident Eisenhower:\r\n\r\n“Senator Kefauver charged on the Senate floor yesterday that the\r\nBudget Bureau was trying to conceal what he called a scandal in the\r\nDixon-Yates contract negotiation regarding the employment of Mr.\r\nAdolphe Wenzell, of the First Boston Corporation,” Van De Linden\r\nsaid. “Senator Knowland says there is no corruption in it, and that\r\nhe thinks you were just trying to help the Tennessee Valley get some\r\npower. I wonder if Mr. Hughes, of the Budget Bureau, had cleared with\r\nyou his refusal to give Mr. Kefauver the information he was asking\r\ndown there?”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower answered: “Mr. Hughes came to see me, went over\r\nthe situation, and I repeated the general instructions—I think that\r\nI expressed some in front of this body—that every single pertinent\r\npaper in the Yates-Dixon contract, from its inception until the final\r\nwriting of the contract, would be made available, I think I said, at\r\nthat time to the press, much less to any committee.”\r\n\r\nAfter seeming to approve an open record, he then qualified it: “Now,\r\nI do stand on this: Nobody has a right to go in and just ... wrecking\r\nthe processes of Government by taking every single file—and some of\r\nyou have seen our file rooms and know their size—and wrecking the\r\nentire filing system and paralyzing the processes of Government while\r\nthey are going through them.”\r\n\r\nThe President rambled on: “There are—these files are filled with\r\nevery kind of personal note—I guess my own files are filled with\r\npersonal notes from my own staff all through; they are honeycombed\r\nwith them. Well, now, to drag those things out where a man says to\r\nme, ‘I think so-and-so is a bad person to appoint, to so-and-so, and\r\nyou shouldn’t have him,’ all he had was his own opinion. You can’t\r\ndrag those things out and put them before the public with justice to\r\nanybody, and we are not going to do it.”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower had engaged in a lot of conversation unrelated\r\nto the information sought. Now he indicated that he personally\r\nbelieved that officials of his administration had already put out all\r\npertinent documents:\r\n\r\n“At the time that I gave those instructions, Mr. Hughes and Mr.\r\nStrauss, whoever else was involved, got together every single\r\ndocument that was pertinent to this thing and put it out.”\r\n\r\nThe President concluded with a complete approval of the Wenzell role:\r\n“Now, as far as the Wenzell report, Mr. Wenzell was never called\r\nin or asked a single thing about the Yates-Dixon contract. He was\r\nbrought into—as a technical adviser in the very early days when none\r\nof us here knew about the bookkeeping methods of the TVA or anything\r\nelse. He was brought in as a technical adviser and nothing else and\r\nbefore this contract was ever even proposed.”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower seemed to have no information about Wenzell’s\r\nrole after January 1954. His comments seemed completely contrary\r\nto the testimony already taken before the Kefauver Subcommittee on\r\nAntitrust and Monopoly. I followed up the Van De Linden question.\r\n\r\n“Mr. President,” I said. “A little while ago you stated that Mr.\r\nWenzell was never called in about the Yates-Dixon contract, and there\r\nseemed to be some testimony before the SEC and before a committee\r\nthat he served as a consultant. I wonder if you were—”\r\n\r\nThe President cut in to answer that “He [Wenzell] did serve as a\r\nconsultant at one time.”\r\n\r\n“Of Dixon-Yates?” I asked it fast.\r\n\r\n“No; I think—now, I will check this up,” the President started. “My\r\nunderstanding is that quickly as the Dixon-Yates thing came up he\r\nresigned, and we got as our consultant a man named Adams from the\r\nPower Commission here itself to come over and be consultant so as\r\nto have him because he [Wenzell] was connected with a great Boston\r\nfinancial company.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. President,” I asked. “Had you been informed that he had no\r\nconnection at all with the Dixon-Yates—?”\r\n\r\n“My understanding of it, and it may have been—that part of it there\r\nmay have been—an overlap of a week or two, there I am not sure of,”\r\nPresident Eisenhower answered. It was difficult to understand he had\r\nso little information on the key issue at this late date.\r\n\r\n“Would there be any change in your position on that if there was\r\nmaterial that he [Wenzell] had served as a consultant on that\r\n[Dixon-Yates]?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“If he had served as a consultant on that [Dixon-Yates] and brought\r\nin a definite recommendation to us I would be very delighted to\r\nmake that public,” President Eisenhower answered. “But I just don’t\r\nbelieve there is a thing in it about it. However, I will have it\r\nchecked again.”\r\n\r\nNoting the press conference statement, Senator Kefauver fired off a\r\nquick letter to President Eisenhower:\r\n\r\n“My Dear Mr. President: I have just been informed that in answer to\r\nquestions of the press today you are recorded as saying that Mr.\r\nAdolphe H. Wenzell was never called in or asked a single thing about\r\nthe Dixon-Yates contract, and that as quickly as the Dixon-Yates\r\nmatter came up Mr. Wenzell resigned. However, you say you will have\r\nit checked again.”\r\n\r\nThen Senator Kefauver followed up with a careful chronological study\r\nof the testimony of Wenzell and other key officials in the Eisenhower\r\nadministration which showed that Wenzell had been a consultant\r\non the Dixon-Yates contract. It also showed that high Eisenhower\r\nadministration officials knew, or should have known, the precise role\r\nthat Wenzell had filled.\r\n\r\nAt his next press conference, on July 6, 1955, President Eisenhower\r\nsaid Wenzell’s role was perfectly “proper” in Dixon-Yates, but\r\nindicated there was a chance the contract might be canceled.\r\n\r\nSenator Kefauver sought an explanation of the Sherman Adams calls to\r\nthe SEC that had postponed hearings on the financial arrangements\r\nfor Dixon-Yates at the crucial point before the House took up the\r\nappropriation measure.\r\n\r\nOn July 21, Adams refused to testify before the Kefauver\r\ninvestigating subcommittee. In a letter to Senator Kefauver he\r\nstated that he could not give testimony because of his confidential\r\nrelationship to the President, and also because “every fact as to\r\nwhich I might give testimony either has been or could be testified to\r\nfully by other responsible government officials.”\r\n\r\nThe same day Kenneth Fields, general manager of the Atomic Energy\r\nCommission, wrote to Kefauver declining to furnish documents on\r\nground they were “privileged communications within the executive\r\nbranch.” Earlier, SEC Chairman Armstrong had made his first refusal\r\nto testify on his conversations with Sherman Adams.\r\n\r\nSenator Kefauver replied to Adams that there had been consistent\r\nclaims of “executive privilege” that barred the investigators from\r\nobtaining the truth.\r\n\r\n“No official of the Government,” the Senator wrote, “no matter how\r\nhigh his position can properly claim privilege when a committee of\r\nCongress is seeking the facts in respect to corruption.”\r\n\r\nSenator Kefauver stated: “In these circumstances a claim of privilege\r\nis tantamount to suppression of evidence of possible crime and\r\ncorruption. Not even the privilege of attorney-client can be used for\r\nsuch a nefarious purpose.”\r\n\r\nSherman Adams hid out behind the protective walls of the White\r\nHouse, unavailable for questioning by Congress and unavailable\r\nfor questioning by the press. “Executive privilege,” as smoothly\r\npracticed by the Eisenhower administration, made it appear that\r\nAdams was invulnerable to attack, or even questioning, on any of his\r\nactivities. Perhaps he _was_ the cold and clean New Hampshire granite\r\nof the legend of Sherman Adams. Perhaps he _was_ the dispassionate,\r\nefficient barrier against the corrupting influences of personal and\r\npolitical favoritism. But, even if Sherman Adams were the puritanic\r\nguardian of good government as pictured, the idea of surrounding any\r\nman’s activities with such arbitrary secrecy was a bad principle.\r\nIt was an open invitation to misuse of power and influence that few\r\ncould withstand.\r\n\r\nAt the July 27, 1955, press conference I questioned President\r\nEisenhower to determine what he knew of the activities of Sherman\r\nAdams in the Dixon-Yates affair.\r\n\r\n“Mr. President,” I said. “There has been testimony of the SEC\r\nChairman [J. Sinclair Armstrong] that Sherman Adams intervened before\r\nthe SEC, which was a quasi-judicial body. Testimony was given by the\r\nchairman on that score.\r\n\r\n“The Democrats are contending that there was something improper in\r\nintervening with any quasi-judicial body. I wonder if you looked into\r\nthat and if you have any comment you would like to make about it.”\r\n\r\nThe President replied that he had “looked into it only to this\r\nextent: I am sure that Mr.—head of the commission—has given the\r\nentire story. I understand that he is back before the committee. And\r\ncertainly if he has omitted any details, he should give them now.”\r\n\r\nThe President continued: “And I believe that Governor Adams has\r\ninformed the Senate committee that he hasn’t a single detail to add;\r\nthat the story has been told and that is all there is to it.”\r\n\r\nGarnett Horner, the White House reporter for the Washington _Star_,\r\ncame in with another question:\r\n\r\n“In connection with the Dixon-Yates matter, and in view of the fact\r\nthat the Senate investigation subcommittee recently brought out the\r\nfirst time the part played in initiating the Dixon-Yates contract by\r\nAdolphe Wenzell, of the First Boston Corporation, which corporation\r\nlater became the financing agent for Dixon-Yates. In view of all\r\nthat, do you believe your directions last summer for disclosure of\r\nthe complete record in the case were carried out by the agencies [the\r\nBureau of the Budget and the Atomic Energy Commission] concerned?”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower replied: “Well, I didn’t know that anyone\r\nhad alleged that he [Wenzell] was the initiator, because no such\r\nstatement has ever been made to me.\r\n\r\n“But what I have done is this: I have gotten back Mr. Dodge, who\r\nwas Director of the Budget when all this was done, when the 1954,\r\nI believe, policy on this statement, on this whole proposition was\r\nmade, and he is going now before one of the committees.”\r\n\r\nThe President turned to Press Secretary James C. Hagerty to ask:\r\n“Isn’t that correct?”\r\n\r\nHagerty answered, “Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe President continued: “He [Dodge] is going down before one of the\r\ncommittees with instruction to do this: to tell every possible item\r\nthat has anything whatsoever to bear on Dixon-Yates, and see whether\r\nwe can get the whole list of information properly coordinated and\r\nplaced before the people that are investigating it.”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower still had not answered the question relative to\r\nwhether he knew that his August 1954 order on complete disclosure on\r\nDixon-Yates had been violated. I followed up the question of Garnett\r\nHorner:\r\n\r\n“I hate to go back to Dixon-Yates again, but there was one thing I\r\ndon’t think was completely clear. There were some AEC officials,\r\nMr. Fields and Mr. Cook, who testified that Mr. Wenzell’s name was\r\nknowingly eliminated from the Dixon-Yates chronology; and, of course,\r\nthey stated this was on the recommendations of the Bureau of the\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you knew anything of this, and if you did know of it, if\r\nyou would like to comment on whether you thought it was important.”\r\n\r\n[On July 21, 1955, Kenneth E. Fields, general manager, Atomic\r\nEnergy Commission, and Richard W. Cook, deputy general manager,\r\nAtomic Energy Commission, testified before the Senate Judiciary\r\nsubcommittee. Fields identified Cook as the man who prepared the\r\nchronology.\r\n\r\n“The Bureau of the Budget suggested that we leave them (the names\r\nof Wenzell and Miller) out,” Cook said in answer to a question from\r\nSenator Joseph O’Mahoney.\r\n\r\n“I can assure you that we did not try to conceal anything,” Cook\r\ncontinued. “They just called to our attention certain minor entries\r\nthat ... didn’t appear to be appropriate.”\r\n\r\n“So they suggested no other names that you leave out except Wenzell\r\nand Miller?” Senator Kefauver asked.\r\n\r\n“No; not that I recall,” Cook answered.]\r\n\r\nThe President knew little about the Dixon-Yates contract even at this\r\nlate date, more than a year after it had first been criticized by\r\nDemocrats. His answer reflected his lack of knowledge, as well as his\r\ndesire to shut off further questions.\r\n\r\n“I don’t intend to comment on it any more at all,” he said. “Now,\r\nI think I have given to this conference time and again, the basic\r\nelements of this whole development, and everything I could possibly\r\nbe expected to know about it.\r\n\r\n“I said Mr. Dodge, who initiated this whole thing, is going down\r\nbefore the committee to again begin the process of taking this thing\r\nfrom its inception and following it through until he turned [it] over\r\nto Mr. Hughes, and I believe that Mr. Hughes is to be there if they\r\nwant him again.\r\n\r\n“Now, they [Dodge and Hughes] can tell the entire story, and I don’t\r\nknow exactly such details as that. How could I be expected to know? I\r\nnever heard of it.”\r\n\r\nIt would have been difficult to imagine a case that dramatized\r\nmore clearly the bad government that could fester under arbitrary\r\nexecutive secrecy. President Eisenhower had issued an order for a\r\nfull chronology of events leading up to the Dixon-Yates contract,\r\nbut, instead, his subordinates had put out a record edited to\r\neliminate the names of persons involved in a “conflict of interest.”\r\n\r\nThe secrecy deceived the public, deceived the committee of Congress,\r\nand even deceived President Eisenhower. His comments over the period\r\nof months showed that his subordinates had misled or deliberately\r\ndeceived him on the key point in the controversy—the role of Adolphe\r\nWenzell. In this respect the secrecy possible under “executive\r\nprivilege” worked against the best interests of President Eisenhower.\r\nApparently his subordinates thought they could distort the record,\r\nand keep it hidden from the public and the President. Only the\r\npersistent work of Senator Kefauver’s investigators pulled loose\r\nsufficient facts to document the deception.\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower might have been able to sell the Dixon-Yates\r\ncontract to the public if it had been handled as a simple debate\r\nof private power versus public power. But he could no longer see\r\nit through once he had been forced to take note of a “conflict of\r\ninterest” that he had previously denied existed.\r\n\r\nCancellation of the Dixon-Yates contract did not end the Eisenhower\r\nadministration’s problem with that ill-fated venture. It was to be a\r\nmajor factor in 1959 in blocking the nomination of Lewis L. Strauss\r\nas Secretary of Commerce.\r\n\r\nIn November of 1955, William Mitchell, counsel for the Atomic Energy\r\nCommission, made a report stating: “It appears that Wenzell, while\r\nhaving a conflicting private interest, acted as one of the principal\r\nadvisers of the government” in the negotiating of the Dixon-Yates\r\ncontract. Mitchell called attention to the many meetings in which\r\nWenzell had taken part as a government official in the first four\r\nmonths of 1954.\r\n\r\n“The matters on which Wenzell was advising the contractor\r\n[Dixon-Yates] were the same on which he had been employed to advise\r\nthe government,” Mitchell stated officially for the AEC.\r\n\r\nWhen the government canceled the contract on grounds of a “conflict\r\nof interest,” the Dixon-Yates group claimed that tremendous\r\nexpenditures had already been made on the contract. When Dixon and\r\nYates sued the government for $3,534,788, the Justice Department\r\nwas forced to go to court with legal briefs and facts to support\r\nthe government contention that Wenzell’s role was a “conflict of\r\ninterests.”\r\n\r\nThus Attorney General Brownell’s department was in court to give\r\nevidence of an impropriety that President Eisenhower had said did not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nLess than a year later, on August 11, 1956, Senator Estes Kefauver\r\nand Senator Joseph O’Mahoney, the Wyoming Democrat, insisted on\r\naction against those engaged in concealing the facts.\r\n\r\nSenator Kefauver charged that Sherman Adams and other “high officials\r\nof the Eisenhower administration” violated the criminal law in\r\ntheir handling of the Dixon-Yates contract. He named the other\r\nhigh officials as Lewis L. Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy\r\nCommission and the President’s adviser on atomic energy matters;\r\nRowland R. Hughes, former Director of the Budget; and J. Sinclair\r\nArmstrong, chairman of the SEC.\r\n\r\nIn asking Attorney General Herbert Brownell to present the matter to\r\na federal grand jury, Kefauver commented:\r\n\r\n“Indictments and convictions have been obtained under Section 371\r\nof Title 18 of the United States Code in cases involving similar\r\ncircumstances. The offense under this section of the Criminal Code\r\nis that of conspiring to defraud the United States Government.\r\nThe essential ingredient of the offense under this section of the\r\nCriminal Code is the failure of a government official to discharge\r\nconscientiously the duties of his office and administer Federal law\r\nin an unbiased manner.”\r\n\r\nKefauver continued: “In this case there exists substantial evidence\r\nindicating that Mr. Adams, Mr. Hughes and Mr. Strauss deliberately\r\nattempted to conceal the conflict of interest growing out of Mr.\r\nWenzell’s dual role in the Dixon-Yates deal—a conflict which the\r\nPresident’s own Attorney General now labels so contrary to public\r\npolicy as to render the agreement null and void.”\r\n\r\nSenator O’Mahoney characterized the Dixon-Yates matter as violating\r\n“every concept of decent government and fair and impartial\r\nadministration of applicable law.”\r\n\r\nThe stentorian-toned Wyoming Senator gave a “partial listing of the\r\nwreckage left strewn in the path” of Dixon-Yates!\r\n\r\n1. “The independent character of the Atomic Energy Commission and the\r\nTennessee Valley Authority was brought into serious question.\r\n\r\n2. “Officials of the Department of Justice and the Securities and\r\nExchange Commission were placed in the position of having been\r\npersuaded to take legal positions which ran counter to precedent of\r\nmany years standing.\r\n\r\n3. “The administration of the law by SEC was brought into disrepute\r\nbecause of SEC’s flagrant departures from accepted interpretations\r\nof the Public Utility Holding Company Act and its succumbing to\r\npressures from ‘higher authority’ emanating from the White House.\r\n\r\n4. “AEC was forced to execute and sponsor a contract which the\r\nDepartment of Justice has since asserted violated the Holding Company\r\nAct, the Atomic Energy Act, and the conflict of interest statutes.”\r\n\r\nO’Mahoney said that there “is no way that we can ascertain the full\r\nfacts” because “the Subcommittee has been completely blocked from\r\ngetting to the bottom of the Dixon-Yates contract by the very men in\r\nthe White House who were involved in these negotiations.”\r\n\r\nAfter this debacle, it surprised me more than ever to discover that\r\nfew people saw the full evil of the broad principle of “executive\r\nprivilege” as set out in the May 17, 1954, letter.\r\n\r\nThere was still a general lack of awareness of the possible\r\ndictatorial power lurking behind the secrecy curtain.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, I did not believe that President Eisenhower would\r\nknowingly use secrecy to cover crimes, but I had doubts about some\r\npeople in his administration. Even if it could be assumed that\r\nevery member of his administration was totally honest, “executive\r\nprivilege” was still too potentially dangerous a doctrine to have in\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nIt was not until January 9, 1961, that the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States stated the final words on the Dixon-Yates contract.\r\nChief Justice Warren delivered the opinion of the Court that Adolphe\r\nH. Wenzell had been involved in a “conflict of interest” which was a\r\nviolation of the law (18 U.S.C. 434).\r\n\r\nThe law states: “Whoever, being an officer, agent or member of,\r\nor directly or indirectly interested in the pecuniary profits or\r\ncontracts of any corporation ... is employed or acts as an officer or\r\nagent of the United States for the transaction of business with such\r\nbusiness entity, shall be fined not more than $2,000 or imprisoned\r\nnot more than two years, or both.”\r\n\r\nNo criminal charge was brought against Wenzell, but the majority\r\nopinion stated that the civil law suit by the Dixon-Yates group\r\ninvolved “fundamental questions relating to the standards of conduct\r\nwhich should govern those who represent the Government in its\r\nbusiness dealings.\r\n\r\n“The question is whether the Government may disaffirm a contract\r\nwhich is infected by an illegal contract,” the majority opinion\r\nstated. “As we have indicated, the public policy embodied in Section\r\n434 requires nonenforcement [of the Dixon-Yates contract] and this is\r\ntrue even though the conflict of interest was caused or condoned by\r\nhigh government officials.”\r\n\r\nThe Eisenhower administration, as I have already stated, could\r\nprobably have made a winning argument for the Dixon-Yates contract in\r\na debate involving simply public power versus private power. However,\r\nthe temptation to use the secrecy of “executive privilege” proved\r\ntoo great, and ironically the secrecy kept President Eisenhower in\r\nthe dark about the details of the role of Adolphe H. Wenzell until\r\nit was too late. Excessive secrecy blinded President Eisenhower and\r\nsome of his assistants until they were so victimized by deceit that\r\nthey could not recover their equilibrium and salvage the Dixon-Yates\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCongress Becomes Concerned\r\n\r\n\r\nIn late 1954 and early 1955, secrecy obscured the facts in a major\r\ncontroversy over administration of the government loyalty-security\r\nprogram. The Republicans had campaigned in 1952 on a charge that the\r\nTruman administration was “soft” on Communists and contended that\r\nan administration headed by Adlai Stevenson could be expected to be\r\ncomposed of many Communist “coddlers.” In the 1954 congressional\r\nelection campaigns the Republicans used statistics compiled by the\r\nEisenhower administration to continue to assert that Democrats were\r\n“soft” on Communists.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats contended that the Eisenhower administration was\r\nengaged in a vicious “numbers game” to pad the statistics and make\r\nit appear that Republicans were tougher about firing Communists\r\nor Communist sympathizers. The Democrats claimed that many loyal\r\ngovernment officials were being arbitrarily forced to resign to build\r\nthe numbers against the Democrats.\r\n\r\nWhen the Democrats won the 1954 election—and thus captured control\r\nof the congressional committees, they were eager to investigate and\r\ndocument the Democratic contention that the communists-in-government\r\nissue was “phony.” Democratic committee members asked for records\r\nthat they believed would prove their case, but they ran into a thick\r\nwall of secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe extreme campaign oratory and pledges had inflamed the issue,\r\nand it was difficult to get it into perspective. Here was no doubt\r\nof laxity in the administration of the security programs by some\r\nagencies, and the conviction of Alger Hiss on a perjury charge had\r\nmade it appear to some Republicans that they were fully justified in\r\ncharging that the Democrats as a whole were “soft” on Communists.\r\nHiss had certainly held a key role in the State Department under\r\nthe Democratic administrations, prior to exposure of his communist\r\nconnections by the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1948.\r\n\r\nMost Republican political figures took a fairly balanced view of the\r\ncommunists-in-government issue. They regarded the administration of\r\nloyalty-security programs as a difficult problem for any political\r\nparty. They saw the need for some personnel changes and a little\r\ntighter administration of loyalty-security matters.\r\n\r\nBut the Republican party also harbored a few overeager,\r\ninexperienced, and a few downright malicious men who tackled the\r\njob of personnel security with a wild, free-swinging vigor and\r\nlittle real judgment. There was a little evidence in 1953 and 1954\r\nof Republican mismanagement of some security cases. However, no\r\nreal tangible evidence surfaced until January 1955, when Senator\r\nOlin D. Johnston, the South Carolina Democrat, and his Committee\r\nStaff Director H. William Brawley started an investigation of the\r\nsecurity program. Johnston was chairman of the Senate Post Office and\r\nCivil Service Committee with jurisdiction over government personnel\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\nThe investigation had barely started when the Eisenhower\r\nadministration sought to hide the bungling and incompetence by\r\nclaiming “executive privilege.” By the time the hearings had been\r\nconcluded in the following fall, the secrecy wall of “executive\r\nprivilege” had been used by the State Department, the Agriculture\r\nDepartment, the Civil Service Commission, and the White House. A\r\nconspiracy of silence hampered the investigation from start to\r\nfinish, but I had obtained enough information on one celebrated\r\nsecurity case to demonstrate the kinds of mistakes and mismanagement\r\ngenerally involved.\r\n\r\nIn December 1954 and January 1955, I had written a series of articles\r\ndescribing the Agriculture Department’s unjustified ruling on Wolf\r\nLadejinsky. Ladejinsky, an agricultural attaché in Tokyo, was called\r\na “security risk” by Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson without\r\nthe slightest evidence that Ladejinsky’s loyalty was questionable.\r\nThe State Department had previously cleared Ladejinsky following an\r\nexhaustive investigation under the new and tighter security standards\r\nestablished by the Eisenhower administration.\r\n\r\nI had been able to verify that the Agriculture Department made its\r\nadverse ruling on the same evidence that had been examined by the\r\nState Department when it cleared Ladejinsky. Harold Stassen, then\r\nhead of the Foreign Operations Administration, moved in quickly to\r\nclear Ladejinsky. His report on Ladejinsky’s file stated that there\r\nwas no evidence that Ladejinsky had ever been sympathetic to any\r\ncommunist causes in the nineteen years he had been employed as an\r\neconomist by the government.\r\n\r\nEven with FOA and State on record clearing Ladejinsky, it took\r\nmore than six months of congressional investigation to force\r\nAgriculture Secretary Benson to withdraw his finding that Ladejinsky\r\nwas a “security risk.” Throughout the entire period of time, the\r\ninvestigating subcommittee was obstructed by the refusal of various\r\nagencies to submit reports and give testimony.\r\n\r\nPhilip Young, chairman of the Civil Service Commission, refused to\r\ncomply with a _subpoena duces tecum_, for production of records. He\r\ncited the May 17, 1954, letter on “executive privilege” and commented:\r\n\r\n“The President’s letter points out that it is essential to efficient\r\nand effective administration that employees of the executive branch\r\nbe in a position to be completely candid in advising each other on\r\nofficial matters, and that it is not in the public interest that\r\nany of our conversations or communications or any documents or\r\nreproductions concerning such advice be disclosed....”\r\n\r\nR. W. Scott McLeod, who then headed the State Department personnel\r\nsecurity program, refused to tell the investigating subcommittee\r\nof his conversations with Milan D. Smith, executive assistant to\r\nAgriculture Secretary Benson. He claimed that to tell what he told\r\nSmith on the Ladejinsky case would reveal advice within the executive\r\nbranch of the government, and would violate President Eisenhower’s\r\ninstructions on “executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nThe report of the subcommittee of the Senate Post Office and Civil\r\nService Committee released on July 22, 1956, devoted an entire\r\nsection to the problem of obtaining information from the executive\r\nbranch in the face of the arbitrary secrecy policies being used under\r\na claim of “executive privilege.”\r\n\r\n“At the outset and throughout the period of its existence the\r\nsubcommittee and staff have been handicapped in their work by the\r\nrefusal of the various executive agencies to submit files, upon\r\nwritten request or by subpena, which files had a bearing upon the\r\noperation of the Government employees’ security program, the very\r\nsubject designated to the subcommittee to investigate,” the official\r\nsubcommittee report stated.\r\n\r\n“Must the Congress set up its own investigational staff with\r\nundercover men in various agencies so as to know what goes on?” the\r\nsubcommittee asked.\r\n\r\nThe report continued: “The legislative function cannot be carried on\r\nin the dark. The Supreme Court has approved the comment of Woodrow\r\nWilson who said:\r\n\r\n“‘It is the proper duty of a representative body to look diligently\r\ninto every affair of Government and to talk much about what it sees.\r\nIt is meant to be the eyes and the voice and to embody the wisdom\r\nand will of its constituents. Unless the Congress have and use every\r\nmeans of acquainting itself with the acts and the disposition of the\r\nadministrative agents of the Government, the country must be helpless\r\nto learn how it is being served; and unless Congress both scrutinize\r\nthese things and sift them by every form of discussion, the country\r\nmust remain in embarrassing, crippling ignorance of the very affairs\r\nwhich it is most important that it should understand and direct.’”\r\n\r\nThe Johnston subcommittee declared that the interpretation being\r\nplaced on the President’s May 17, 1954, letter was such “as to force\r\nthe Congress to legislate in a vacuum. Each department or agency head\r\nis the arbiter of what he should disclose, and in some instances\r\ndisclosures were made when they reflected a credit on the department\r\nor agency or discredit on a committee witness.”\r\n\r\nOnce again officials had testified freely on matters that made the\r\npolitical party or agency look good, but refused to produce records\r\nthat might embarrass them.\r\n\r\nThe report cited the classic legal treatise, _Wigmore on Evidence_.\r\nIn this work Professor Wigmore denies that the Chief Executive or\r\nany other officer has a testimonial privilege not to be a witness in\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n“The public (in the words of Lord Hardwicke) has a right to every\r\nman’s evidence,” Professor Wigmore wrote. “Is there any reason why\r\nthis right should suffer an exemption when the desired knowledge is\r\nin the possession of a person occupying at the moment the office of\r\nthe Chief Executive of a State?\r\n\r\n“There is no reason at all. His temporary duties as an official\r\ncannot override his permanent and fundamental duty as a citizen and\r\nas a debtor to justice. The general principle ... of testimonial\r\nduty to disclose Knowledge needed in judicial investigations is of\r\nuniversal force. It does not suffer an exception which would be\r\nirrespective of the nature of the person’s Knowledge and would rest\r\nwholly in the nature of the person’s occupation....\r\n\r\n“Let it be understood then, that there is no exemption for officials\r\nas such, or for the Executive as such, from the universal testimonial\r\nduty to give evidence in judicial investigations. The exemptions that\r\nexist are defined by other principles.”\r\n\r\nThe Johnston subcommittee report also made note of the act of the\r\nFirst Congress establishing the Treasury Department. This law made\r\nit the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to “report and give\r\ninformation to either branch of the Legislature, in person or in\r\nwriting (as may be required) respecting all matters referred to him\r\nby the Senate or House of Representatives, or which shall appertain\r\nto his office....”\r\n\r\nThe subcommittee did not contend that it could force the President\r\nor cabinet officers to testify on any subject, but it did contend\r\nthat cabinet officers must testify when there is a specific statute\r\ncovering their responsibility.\r\n\r\nAttention was called to the Supreme Court ruling in the famous case\r\nof _McGrain v. Daugherty_, handed down in 1927 in connection with the\r\nSenate investigation of the Teapot Dome scandals. The opinion written\r\nby Justice Van Devanter stated:\r\n\r\n“We are of the opinion that the power of inquiry—with process\r\nto enforce it—is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the\r\nlegislative function.... A legislative body cannot legislate\r\nwisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the\r\nconditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change;\r\nand where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite\r\ninformation—which not infrequently is true—recourse must be had\r\nto others who do possess it.... Thus there is ample warrant for\r\nthinking, as we do, that the constitutional provisions which commit\r\nthe legislative function to the two Houses are intended to include\r\nthis attribute to the end that the function may be effectively\r\nexercised.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the best authorities it seemed clear that Congress had\r\nthe power to compel testimony when searching for facts within its\r\njurisdiction. The Supreme Court had held that private persons could\r\nbe compelled to testify, and it seemed equally clear that government\r\nofficials could be compelled to give evidence. There was no way for\r\nCongress to force the President personally to give testimony or\r\nproduce records except by impeaching him. Yet he was obligated, along\r\nwith all other government officials, to give testimony or produce\r\nrecords for a proper congressional committee as long as the national\r\nsecurity was not endangered.\r\n\r\nCertainly the revelation of testimony of conversations between a\r\nState Department personnel officer and an Agriculture Department\r\npersonnel officer on the Wolf Ladejinsky case would not endanger\r\nthe national security of the United States. It is significant that\r\nthe Department of Agriculture departed from precedent in previous\r\nsecurity cases in making information on Ladejinsky available, but\r\nthis was information derogatory to Ladejinsky. The Department\r\nused secrecy to hide its own faulty administration. The claim of\r\n“executive privilege” was simply being used to cover up, and everyone\r\nfamiliar with the record knew it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSecrecy Hides the Security Bunglers\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the spring of 1955, enough executive agencies were refusing\r\nrecords to Congress that Representative William Dawson, the Illinois\r\nDemocrat who served as chairman of the House Government Operations\r\nCommittee, had become concerned.\r\n\r\nOn June 9, 1955, Representative Dawson wrote to Representative John\r\nE. Moss, the young California Democrat, formally establishing a\r\nGovernment Information Subcommittee and asking that Moss be chairman.\r\nCongressman Moss was only in his second term in Congress, and\r\nnormally would not have been assigned chairmanship of a subcommittee\r\nunless it appeared relatively unimportant as a vehicle for publicity.\r\n\r\n“Charges have been made that Government agencies have denied or\r\nwithheld pertinent and timely information to the newspapers,\r\nto radio, and television broadcasters, magazines, and other\r\ncommunication media, to trained and qualified research experts and to\r\nthe Congress,” Congressman Dawson wrote.\r\n\r\n“An informed public makes the difference between mob rule and\r\ndemocratic government. If the pertinent and necessary information\r\non governmental activities is denied the public, the result is a\r\nweakening of the democratic process and the ultimate atrophy of our\r\nform of government.”\r\n\r\nMoss took the assignment immediately but waited five months before\r\nstarting what was to become the committee’s five-year struggle with\r\nthe Eisenhower administration.\r\n\r\nAlthough the investigation ultimately became involved almost\r\nexclusively in trying to break down the barrier of “executive\r\nprivilege,” it started out on general information policy problems.\r\nAt the time of the first hearing (November 5, 1955) there was only a\r\nhandful of observers greatly concerned over “executive privilege.”\r\nJames S. Pope, executive editor of the Louisville _Courier-Journal_,\r\nJ. Russell Wiggins, executive editor of the Washington _Post and\r\nTimes Herald_, and Harold L. Cross, special counsel for the American\r\nSociety of Newspaper Editors, were among those who shared my worry.\r\n\r\nJames (Scotty) Reston, Washington correspondent for The New York\r\n_Times_, had recently expressed concern over “managed news.” He\r\nobjected to “the conscious effort” to give news emanating from the\r\nGeneva Conference “an optimistic” flavor.\r\n\r\n“After the Geneva smiling, the new word went out that it might be a\r\ngood idea now to frown a little bit, so the President made a speech\r\nat Philadelphia, taking quite a different light about the Geneva\r\nConference,” Reston said. “That is what I mean by managing the news.”\r\n\r\nI didn’t like “managed news” any better than Reston, but I believed\r\nthat the arbitrary secrecy of “executive privilege” was the core\r\nof the problem. There would be “managed news” as long as executive\r\ndepartments and independent regulatory agencies were able to invoke\r\nan arbitrary secrecy to prevent the press and Congress from reviewing\r\nthe record—and as long as newspapers indolently accepted the\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nThe Moss subcommittee gave me an excellent chance to state my views\r\nthe first day of its hearings. I began my testimony with a review\r\nof the history of the May 17, 1954, letter and the Army-McCarthy\r\nhearings.\r\n\r\n“Since that time,” I stated, “seventeen departments of the Government\r\nhave used this letter as a precedent for withholding actual decisions\r\nof the government. Conversations and documents used in arriving\r\nat decisions are regarded as confidential, and the Congress and\r\nreporters alike are denied information.”\r\n\r\nI pointed out that the American Civil Liberties Union had filed a\r\ncomplaint against the use of “executive privilege” by subordinates\r\nof executive agencies. And I commented that it was startling to find\r\nSenator McCarthy and the American Civil Liberties Union together on\r\nan issue.\r\n\r\n“I think this demonstrates that this is not something political,” I\r\nsaid. “The party in power may gain some kind of a temporary advantage\r\nfrom hiding the record, but in a long-time advantage, for both\r\nparties, it is best to try to make a full disclosure of what goes on\r\nin government.”\r\n\r\nIn answer to questions I said I did not object to specific\r\nlegislation to cover areas of government where secrecy was essential.\r\nI emphasized that “if the record of the government must be\r\nconfidential, it is not too much to ask the executive department to\r\ngive a reason. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have an equal\r\ninterest in obtaining ... the whole story, all of the information\r\nbehind the decisions of the executive agency.”\r\n\r\nThe next week, the Moss subcommittee on Government Information began\r\ncalling the long roll of witnesses from the Post Office Department,\r\nthe Agriculture Department, the Treasury Department, and the Civil\r\nService Commission. The first task was to try to establish from\r\nreports and testimony just what the information practices of each of\r\nthese departments were.\r\n\r\nA few months of work revealed to Chairman Moss and his staff a\r\ntendency toward “a flexible policy” in many departments. A department\r\nmight refuse to produce information on one ground, and then jump to\r\nanother reason when the first became untenable. I knew that some\r\npress officials were poorly schooled as to what should and should\r\nnot be made available, and that they made up the rules as they went\r\nalong. If the Moss subcommittee had done no more than establish a\r\nwritten record on the laws and regulations being used for information\r\npolicies its effort would have been worthwhile. Fortunately it did a\r\nlot more.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the first week of hearings the subcommittee staff\r\n(Staff Director Samuel J. Archibald, Chief Counsel Wallace J. Parks,\r\nand Special Counsel Jacob Scher) had already gathered a large\r\ncollection of rules and regulations on information. Also, they had\r\ninserted in the record a copy of a Joint Resolution, No. 342, passed\r\nby the House of Representatives on May 13, 1948—a not-so-gentle\r\nreminder.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Eightieth Congress of 1948 had been so irritated at\r\nthe Truman administration for its refusal to make records available\r\nto Congress that it passed a resolution directing “all executive\r\ndepartments and agencies of the Federal Government created by\r\nCongress” to furnish “such information, books, records and memoranda”\r\nas was demanded by a majority vote in any properly authorized\r\ncommittee of Congress.\r\n\r\nAt the time of that dispute in 1948, such leading Democrats as John\r\nW. McCormack, of Massachusetts, and William L. Dawson, of Illinois,\r\ndefended the Truman administration for refusing to make available a\r\nCommerce Department investigative report on Dr. Edward U. Condon,\r\ndirector of the National Bureau of Standards.\r\n\r\nPresident Truman had issued an executive order in which he stated\r\nthat “efficient and just administration of the employee loyalty\r\nprogram ... requires that reports, records, and files relative to the\r\nprogram be preserved in strict confidence.”\r\n\r\nEven though this was a specific executive order, and limited to\r\ninvestigative reports and personnel files, the Republicans were\r\noutraged at being denied access to all information on cases under\r\ninvestigation by Congress.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 1955, when the tables had turned, the Republicans used\r\nthe same basic arguments the Democrats used in 1948. The Republicans,\r\nmoreover, were having to defend a far more widespread withholding of\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nDuring this dispute, I examined the 1948 records of the Senate on\r\nan investigation of a loyalty case involving William Remington,\r\nanother Commerce Department official. William P. Rogers had been\r\nchief counsel for the committee investigating the Remington case, and\r\nhad been in charge of preparing the Senate subcommittee report that\r\ncastigated the Truman administration for arbitrary and unjustified\r\nsecrecy in withholding personnel investigation files. In those\r\nreports, Rogers had likened withholding information from Congress to\r\nkeeping the seeing-eye dog from a blind man.\r\n\r\nThis was the same William P. Rogers who was appointed Deputy Attorney\r\nGeneral in the first term of the Eisenhower administration, and who\r\nlater became the Attorney General and the leading spokesman for the\r\nultimate in “executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nIn his early days in the Justice Department, I saw Bill Rogers on\r\na number of occasions and pointed out the inconsistency of his\r\npositions. I asked him how he could be such a caustic critic of\r\nsecrecy in the Truman administration, and then suddenly switch to\r\nbeing a leading advocate of such total arbitrary secrecy as used by\r\nthe Eisenhower administration in its stretched claim of “executive\r\nprivilege.”\r\n\r\n“When you can show me that some crime or wrongdoing is being covered\r\nup, come up and see me,” Rogers said.\r\n\r\nI tried to reason with him, explaining that there were no laws and no\r\njudicial decisions to support so absurd a claim to an arbitrary right\r\nto withhold information. Rogers became jocular and said I was taking\r\nthe whole business too seriously. He said that if there were serious\r\ncases he would examine them. He laughed off my suggestion that the\r\ncases then available were serious and some day in the future could be\r\nused as precedent to bury Democratic scandals from Republicans.\r\n\r\nRogers said that newspaper editorials had been in favor of the May\r\n17, 1954, letter when it was issued, and that there was little\r\nsupport on my side. I stuck to my argument that he was contradicting\r\nhis own position of six or seven years earlier. But it was no use to\r\ntry to argue with him. I left him to do his explaining later to the\r\nMoss subcommittee and other congressional committees.\r\n\r\nOn May 8, 1956, the Moss subcommittee on Government Information heard\r\ntestimony from Bernard Schwartz, professor of law and director of the\r\nInstitute of Comparative Law at New York University; Hugh Fulton,\r\nformer chief counsel for the Truman committee; and Harold L. Cross,\r\nspecial counsel for the American Society of Newspaper Editors.\r\n\r\nFulton, after an exhaustive statement on the problem of arbitrary\r\nwithholding by the executive agencies, concluded that the efforts to\r\nimpair the investigative power of Congress “hampers the legislative\r\npowers and imperils democracy as we know it.”\r\n\r\nHarold Cross, who had been practicing law since 1912, had also served\r\nfor twenty-five years as a professor of newspaper law in the Graduate\r\nSchool of Journalism, Columbia University. I had known him for some\r\nyears through work on projects for the American Society of Newspaper\r\nEditors.\r\n\r\nIn his testimony, Cross struck at the legal basis of the memorandum\r\nof Attorney General Herbert Brownell that had accompanied the May 17,\r\n1954, letter.\r\n\r\n“Some of the findings of the memorandum ... are accurate,” Cross\r\nsaid. [But] “the underlined part of the statement is merely an\r\nassertion by the Attorney General. It is at direct variance with\r\npertinent court rulings.\r\n\r\n“These cases, and others, are cited to this subcommittee as blanket\r\nauthority for withholding information. They are cited as establishing\r\nin Federal officials, subordinates as well as heads, an inherent\r\nright to withhold information—not only from the public and press\r\nand individual Congressmen, but also from Congress itself and its\r\ncommittees. They are cited as establishing rights to withhold that\r\nare final and not subject to judicial review.\r\n\r\n“Moreover,” Cross said, “these Attorney General opinions, which cite\r\nno judicial authority, are inaccurate, are at direct variance with\r\npertinent court rulings.”\r\n\r\nCross concluded that Brownell’s “inaccurate” legal rulings “are both\r\ncited and applied as if they were Holy Writ to suppress information\r\nwhich this Congress needs in order to legislate, which the press\r\nneeds in order to perform its functions and which citizens need in\r\norder to maintain a self-governing society.”\r\n\r\nIt was inspiring to have such a clear statement and such an\r\nexhaustive study from Harold Cross. He was highly respected by the\r\neditors of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and I was\r\ncertain that his logic would soon convince many editors of the\r\nwisdom of a united opposition to the unbridled claim of “executive\r\nprivilege.”\r\n\r\nNow came my first meeting with Bernard Schwartz, then only\r\nthirty-three years old but already a recognized authority in the\r\nfields of constitutional and administrative law. The testimony of\r\nthis short, dark-haired professor with the heavy glasses was clear,\r\nwell documented, restrained. His condemnation of the May 17, 1954,\r\nletter was altogether effective.\r\n\r\nThe letter claimed, Schwartz said, that the executive agencies had\r\n“the absolute privilege and discretion” to withhold information from\r\nCongress and the public.\r\n\r\n“Those who assert that the law is settled in favor of an unlimited\r\nright in the Executive ... do so out of an excess of executive zeal\r\nbut without any real basis in fact, or in law for that matter.\r\n\r\n“There is no statute or judicial decision which justifies the extreme\r\npretensions of privilege consistently maintained by executive\r\nofficials,” Schwartz said.\r\n\r\n“It is true that there is a long history of executive refusals to\r\ncomply with congressional investigative demands and that these\r\nrefusals have often been justified, upon supposed legal grounds, by\r\nopinions of the Attorney General,” he continued. “Neither opinions\r\nof the Attorney General nor the practice of the Executive can\r\njustify unwarranted distortions of the Constitution.... Nor does a\r\ngovernmental practice conceived in error become elevated to the plane\r\nof legality merely because the error has been long persisted in.”\r\n\r\nSchwartz called attention to arguments that Congress was abusing\r\nits investigative power, and commented: “To this writer, indeed,\r\nthe overriding danger is not Congressional abuse but the vesting of\r\nunfettered discretion in the Executive to surround with secrecy all\r\nits activities.\r\n\r\n“Those who are concerned with the possibility of legislative abuse\r\nignore the overriding peril of the present century, that [of] the\r\nsuperstate with its omnipotent administration, unrestrained by\r\nany checks on its all-pervasive regulatory activities, so vividly\r\npictured by George Orwell in his novel _1984_.\r\n\r\n“The great danger today is 1984, not Senator McCarthy. If the elected\r\nrepresentatives of the people assert their right to lay bare all\r\nthat goes on within the Executive, that danger may be avoided. An\r\nExecutive whose abuses and inadequacies are exposed to the public eye\r\ncan hardly become a menace to constitutional government.”\r\n\r\nThere had never been any doubt in my mind about the basic problems\r\ninvolved in the executive claim of an unlimited right to withhold\r\ninformation. But it was comforting to be supported by the exhaustive\r\nlegal studies of Fulton, Cross, and Schwartz.\r\n\r\nThis was only the start of an interesting association with Professor\r\nSchwartz, who later became a headline figure as a result of his\r\ncontroversial investigation of the independent regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSecrecy Curtain on Iron Curtain Deals\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Moss investigations continued, the Senate Permanent\r\nInvestigating Subcommittee was accumulating evidence that showed\r\nhow a relaxation of government controls over shipments of vital and\r\nstrategic materials had resulted in a sharply increased flow of these\r\nmaterials to the Soviet-bloc countries. In February 1956, Chairman\r\nJohn L. McClellan, the Arkansas Democrat, opened public hearings on\r\nthe relaxation of controls over East-West trade.\r\n\r\nMcClellan announced that his staff—headed by Chief Counsel Robert\r\nF. Kennedy and Investigator LaVern Duffy—had discovered “evidence\r\nthat merchants of the free world are helping to build up Russia’s\r\nmilitary potential by furnishing it items which are indispensable in\r\nconstructing or maintaining a war machine.”\r\n\r\nIn August 1954, representatives of the North Atlantic Treaty\r\nOrganization nations, plus Japan, had met in Paris in a Coordinating\r\nCommittee known as COCOM. This committee had downgraded, or otherwise\r\ndecontrolled, approximately 150 out of 450 strategic items. Items\r\nremoved from the embargo list included heavy metal-working machinery,\r\nelectric power generating equipment, minerals, metals, transportation\r\nequipment, and petroleum products and equipment.\r\n\r\n“Such downgrading and removal [from embargo lists] has been harmful\r\nto the security of the non-Communist world,” Chairman McClellan said.\r\n\r\nChief Counsel Kennedy tried to push into the U.S. Government agencies\r\nto find out how this relaxation had taken place, and to pin down\r\nthe responsibility for the action. Excuses of security were given\r\nto refuse information, and there were claims that testimony by U.S.\r\nofficials might interfere with our relations with our allies. When\r\nsuch excuses failed to stand up, the blanket arbitrary secrecy of\r\n“executive privilege” was invoked to hide disputes that had taken\r\nplace in government on the revision of the strategic materials list.\r\n\r\nThe committee was forced to rely on testimony from persons no longer\r\nin government, or on tips from persons in government who contacted\r\ninvestigators quietly because they feared losing their jobs if they\r\nco-operated openly.\r\n\r\nThanks to such testimony, it soon became apparent who had changed\r\nthe strategic materials list to permit shipment of copper, aluminum,\r\nprecision boring machines, and huge horizontal boring and drilling\r\nand milling machines to Iron Curtain countries.\r\n\r\n“The downgrading and decontrol of approximately 150 of the items,”\r\nthe McClellan subcommittee reported, “were recommended by personnel\r\nin our own Government agencies on the so-called Joint Operating\r\nCommittees, contrary to advice of the experts and technicians of\r\nthe Defense Department and in many instances against the advice of\r\nexperts in their own agencies.”\r\n\r\nThere were indications at an early stage of the investigations that\r\nthe revisions in the embargo list made the whole strategic list a\r\ncomplete farce. Simple jig boring machines were retained on the list\r\nas being prohibited from shipment to a potential enemy. However, the\r\nrevised list allowed the shipment of more modern precision boring\r\nmachines of much higher strategic value.\r\n\r\nInitially the Eisenhower administration policy was not unified in\r\nbarring access to testimony and records. But, as the subcommittee\r\nintensified its investigation, the requests for information ran into\r\na stone wall of opposition from the executive agencies involved—the\r\nState Department, Defense Department, Commerce Department, and the\r\nForeign Operations Administration. No one claimed that defense\r\nsecrets were involved. The executive branch abandoned any pretense\r\nand fell back on the arbitrary refusal by simply citing President\r\nEisenhower’s May 17, 1954, letter.\r\n\r\nThe arrogance of the executive branch was best demonstrated by\r\nthe letter from Secretary of Commerce Sinclair Weeks to Commerce\r\nDepartment employees. He wrote:\r\n\r\n“You are instructed not to testify either in public or executive\r\nclosed session with respect to any advice, recommendations,\r\ndiscussions and communications within the executive branch respecting\r\nany course of action in regard to East-West trade control or as\r\nto any information regarding international negotiation with the\r\ncountries cooperating in East-West trade controls....”\r\n\r\nWeeks tried to give some color of law to the claim of executive\r\nsecrecy by citing three federal court cases, but the subcommittee\r\ndeclared none of the cases cited involved the right to withhold\r\ninformation from congressional committees.\r\n\r\nIt was Harold Stassen, then a Special Assistant to the President,\r\nwho balked at giving information in a manner that most galled the\r\nsubcommittee members.\r\n\r\n“Are you willing to give us full, detailed, and complete\r\ninformation?” Chairman McClellan asked Stassen.\r\n\r\nStassen replied: “I am willing to give you, and the executive\r\nbranch is willing to give you, every bit of information that does\r\nnot violate one of three considerations: One, security from the\r\nstandpoint of intelligence; two, the rule on internal executive\r\nbranch documents ...; three, the details of international\r\nnegotiations which would make our relations with our allies more\r\ndifficult.”\r\n\r\n“Are you willing to give us the list of items that were decontrolled\r\nor downgraded?”\r\n\r\n“No, I do not have ... those lists now.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” McClellan said. “Let me ask you: Are you permitted to\r\ntestify under the security cloak that is wrapped around Government\r\nofficials in this matter?”\r\n\r\nStassen declared that McClellan was helping the Communists in\r\nrevealing material on the strategic materials list.\r\n\r\n“You say I am helping the Communists,” McClellan snapped. “The\r\nallies, whose position you are defending, Great Britain—I hope our\r\nstrongest ally—publishes the list so the Communists can see what she\r\nwill sell, the very items that are today classified from the Congress\r\nand the American people.”\r\n\r\nStassen was surprised. “The United Kingdom does not publish the\r\ninternational list, Mr. Chairman, that I know of.”\r\n\r\nMcClellan picked up some papers and extended them toward Stassen.\r\n“Here it is; I hold it in my hand. This is a Board of Trade\r\n_Journal_, October 16, 1954, on which wire, copper wire, is excluded,\r\nso they know they can buy it.”\r\n\r\n“Would you give it to me, please?” asked Stassen.\r\n\r\nEven after Stassen was given the list published by the British, he\r\nrefused to make the almost identical American list available to the\r\nMcClellan subcommittee. After a long and unsuccessful effort to\r\nobtain information from Stassen, Senator Sam Ervin concluded that the\r\nEisenhower administration was willing to talk a lot but say nothing.\r\n\r\nIn his slow North Carolina drawl, the gray-haired Democrat elaborated:\r\n\r\n“We have had experience here that people in the lower echelons of the\r\nexecutive departments have had their mouths stopped, and we were told\r\nthat those who were at the higher levels could give us information.\r\nBut I have come to this conclusion: That our position is sort of\r\nlike that of one of my clients, who came in my office one day and\r\nsaid that he wanted to get a divorce from his wife.\r\n\r\n“He admitted she was a good woman, a good mother, and a good\r\nhousekeeper. I said, ‘Well, what in the world do you want to get a\r\ndivorce from her for?’ He said, ‘Well, she just talks, and talks, and\r\ntalks, and talks, and talks all the time.’ I said, ‘What does she\r\ntalk about?’ And he said, ‘Well, she don’t say.’”\r\n\r\nStassen’s refusal to say anything was made all the more appalling by\r\nthe publication of _The Inside Story_, a book about the Eisenhower\r\nadministration written by Robert J. Donovan of the New York _Herald\r\nTribune_.\r\n\r\n“The contents of the book,” the McClellan subcommittee stated, “are\r\nbased upon documents, materials, minutes, and other information\r\nsimilar in nature and character to that which this subcommittee has\r\nbeen trying to obtain in the course of discharging its legislative\r\nduties and responsibilities.\r\n\r\n“The executive branches of the Government have been adamant in\r\nrefusing to make such information available to this subcommittee, and\r\nit is difficult to reconcile such attitude with its willingness to\r\ngive similar information to private individuals.”\r\n\r\nThe McClellan subcommittee was not critical of Donovan, but the\r\nmembers were infuriated by the policy inconsistencies. A request was\r\nmade for Maxwell Rabb, Cabinet Secretary, to appear and explain the\r\nreasons and circumstances surrounding the release of information to\r\nDonovan.\r\n\r\n“Rabb failed and refused to appear,” the subcommittee reported.\r\n“Thereafter, a letter was sent to Under Secretary of State [Herbert]\r\nHoover [Jr.], Secretary of Commerce [Sinclair] Weeks, ICA Director\r\n[John B.] Hollister, Assistant Secretary of Defense Gordon Gray,\r\ncalling attention to the fact that material of a confidential nature\r\nand relating to the internal workings of the government at Cabinet\r\nand staff levels had been disclosed to a private individual for a\r\ncommercial purpose, and in the light of these facts, the chairman\r\nof the subcommittee again requested that the documents of the Joint\r\nOperating Committee, relating to decontrol of strategic materials, be\r\nmade available to this subcommittee as early as possible.”\r\n\r\nThe information was not supplied, and the McClellan subcommittee\r\ndeclared that this “suppression of information raises not only the\r\nquestion as to the right of Congress to know, but also the question\r\nof the right of the public in a democracy to be informed as to the\r\nactivities of its government.”\r\n\r\nIn its reports, the McClellan subcommittee declared that the doctrine\r\nof separation of powers as explained in President Eisenhower’s\r\nMay 17, 1954, letter was totally wrong in asserting the complete\r\nindependence of the executive branch. The subcommittee quoted from\r\nthe opinion of Chief Justice William Howard Taft in the Grossman case\r\nin which he said:\r\n\r\n“Complete independence and separation between the three branches,\r\nhowever, are not attained or intended, as other provisions of the\r\nConstitution and the normal operation of government under it easily\r\ndemonstrate.” The Grossman case set out the various checks the\r\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial departments are specifically\r\ngranted under the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe subcommittee legal report stated flatly that there are no legal\r\ncases upholding the claimed “inherent right to withhold information”\r\nfrom Congress.\r\n\r\nIn another report, the subcommittee also challenged the broad use of\r\nthe May 17, 1954, letter from Eisenhower to Defense Secretary Wilson.\r\nThe report quoted from the May 17, 1954, letter:\r\n\r\n“You will instruct employees of your Department that in all\r\ntheir appearances before the subcommittee of the Senate Committee\r\non Government Operation regarding the inquiry now before it\r\n[Army-McCarthy hearings] they are not to testify....”\r\n\r\n“It is clear that this letter was intended to apply specifically\r\nto the Army-McCarthy hearings,” the subcommittee report concluded,\r\nbut the fact was that it had “been cited by twenty or more federal\r\nagencies and departments as grounds for refusing information to\r\nCongress.”\r\n\r\nChairman McClellan went on the Senate floor to express his concern\r\nover the total secrecy that was being clamped on the executive branch.\r\n\r\n“The Government agencies acting in concert are doing everything to\r\nhinder and hamper the Subcommittee’s efforts to ascertain the facts\r\nconcerning the relaxation of these controls,” the Senator declared.\r\n“Except for some co-operation from the Department of Defense, the\r\ninformation has not been forthcoming. The facts the Subcommittee has\r\ndeveloped thus far ... have not been made available or furnished ...\r\nby the executive agencies.\r\n\r\n“The information we have has been secured from documents and\r\npublications of foreign governments, where the information is being\r\nfreely given out by our allies. That same information in the United\r\nStates is being withheld by the executive branch of our Government\r\nfrom both the Congress and the American people.”\r\n\r\nMcClellan declared it is “a farce” how the Battle Act list of\r\nstrategic materials is withheld from Congress and the people of the\r\nUnited States but is available to the Communist-bloc countries.\r\n“They know what they can buy,” he said. “They [the Communist bloc\r\ncountries] know what they do buy and have bought.\r\n\r\n“Can it be ... this classification, this policy of secrecy, this\r\nsuppression or withholding of the truth is a process or an action\r\ndesigned for hiding of errors, inefficiency and bad judgment of\r\nGovernment officials?” he asked. “I am convinced it is. If not, then\r\nwhy not give the Congress the information and let the American people\r\nknow the truth?”\r\n\r\nSenator Richard Russell, the veteran Georgia Democrat, joined\r\nMcClellan in denouncing the arbitrary secrecy in the East-West trade\r\ninvestigations. He said it presented “a very shocking picture of the\r\nfailure of co-operation with the Congress in a field in which we\r\nhave as direct a responsibility or a greater responsibility than the\r\nexecutive department in attempting to maintain a superiority in arms,\r\nin order that we may defend our country.”\r\n\r\nSenator Wayne Morse, the Oregon Democrat, also lashed out at the\r\nsecrecy, and declared that such hiding of government records would\r\njustify voting against the whole foreign-aid program.\r\n\r\n“We have a right to know what goods foreign-aid countries ship to\r\nRussia,” Morse said. “We are not asking for the disclosure of secrets\r\nwhich involve the war plans of our country, [and] which should be\r\nkept secret.”\r\n\r\nSenator Joseph R. McCarthy and Senator Morse were rarely together\r\non an issue. But on the question of secrecy in the Eisenhower\r\nadministration, Senator McCarthy lined up with Morse, McClellan,\r\nRussell, and such liberals as Senator Paul Douglas (Dem., Ill.) and\r\nSenator Thomas Hennings (Dem., Mo.).\r\n\r\n“I was extremely critical of the Democrat administration for\r\nwithholding information from Congress,” McCarthy said in a Senate\r\nspeech. “During the hearings which the very able Senator from\r\nArkansas has been conducting, I was appalled by the even greater\r\nsecrecy maintained by the executive branch today. As the years go\r\nby the Executive is becoming more and more arrogant and highhanded\r\ntoward legitimate congressional requests for information.”\r\n\r\nBy this time I was starting to feel optimistic about breaking the\r\nsecrecy barrier, for it seemed that political figures of all\r\ncomplexions were aroused about the danger it created for a democratic\r\ngovernment. Additionally, at this time there came a report, dated May\r\n3, 1956, from the House Government Operations Committee, parent of\r\nthe Moss subcommittee. It stated that the Eisenhower administration’s\r\nclaim to an inherent right to secrecy “has never been upheld by the\r\ncourts. It has been a mere Executive _ipse dixit_ [say so].”\r\n\r\nThe five-point conclusion of this report seemed to me to be as fine a\r\nrésumé of the legal situation as I had seen:\r\n\r\n“1. Refusals by the President and heads of departments to furnish\r\ninformation to the Congress are not constitutional law. They\r\nrepresent a mere naked claim of privilege. The judiciary has never\r\nspecifically ruled on the direct problem involved in a refusal by\r\nFederal agencies to furnish information to the Congress.\r\n\r\n“2. As far as access to information is concerned the courts\r\nhave not distinguished basically between executive agencies and\r\nquasi-legislative or quasi-judicial agencies. Both appear to stand in\r\nthe same status.\r\n\r\n“3. Judicial precedent shows that even the President has been held\r\nto be subject to the power of subpena of the courts. While this is\r\nso, it may be that the only recourse against the President himself is\r\nimpeachment if he fails to comply with a subpena of either the courts\r\nor the Congress.\r\n\r\n“4. Any possible presidential immunity from the enforcement of legal\r\nprocess does not extend to the heads of departments and other Federal\r\nagencies. Judicial opinions have never recognized any inherent\r\nright in the heads of Federal agencies to withhold information from\r\nthe courts. The courts have stated that even where the head of the\r\ndepartment or agency bases his action on statutory authority the\r\ncourts will judge the reasonableness of the action in the same light\r\nas any other claim of privilege. The courts have held that the mere\r\nclaim of privilege is not enough.\r\n\r\n“5. There is no inherent right on the part of heads of the\r\ndepartments or other Federal agencies to withhold information from\r\nthe Congress any more than they have a right to withhold information\r\nfrom the Judiciary....”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore the McClellan subcommittee on the Senate side completed\r\nits report, a number of voices had been raised in defense of the\r\nEisenhower administration’s secrecy. But they did not seem to\r\nbe strong voices. Only Senator Karl E. Mundt, the South Dakota\r\nRepublican, and George H. Bender, the Ohio Republican, signed a\r\nminority report on the East-West trade investigation.\r\n\r\nSenator Mundt and Senator Bender charged that the report of the\r\nfive-member majority “is entirely misleading as to the effectiveness\r\nof international control of strategic materials.” Although Chairman\r\nMcClellan had consistently indicated a willingness to take testimony\r\nor records in a closed session if a problem of real national\r\nsecurity was involved, Mundt and Bender defended the Eisenhower\r\nadministration’s refusal to make information available on grounds\r\nthat to testify might help the Communists.\r\n\r\n“To make some of this information available in public session would\r\ntell the Communist nations about our strategic and short supply,\r\nreason for control and decontrol,” the Mundt-Bender report stated.\r\n“We would publicize for the benefit of potential enemies the\r\nthoughts, recommendations, advice and working papers of subordinates\r\nwho worked for those in the executive branch who held and exercised\r\naction responsibility.”\r\n\r\nIn years past, Senator Mundt had been highly critical of the secrecy\r\nof the Truman administration. Now, however, he said he wished to\r\n“disassociate myself from that conclusion” by Senator McClellan that\r\nsecrecy is being used to cover up “errors, inefficiency and bad\r\njudgment.”\r\n\r\n“I think at the moment it is purely a political deduction,” Senator\r\nMundt said.\r\n\r\nHardly anyone took Senator Bender’s position seriously for he was\r\ngenerally regarded as a political buffoon. To discredit his support\r\nof the Eisenhower administration’s secrecy, the majority report\r\nmerely quoted from two speeches that Bender had made as a House\r\nmember in October 1951.\r\n\r\nIn October 1951, when the shoe had been on the other foot, Bender\r\nrose on two occasions to castigate the Truman administration for a\r\ncensorship of government information.\r\n\r\n“Power over the press,” he said, “is the path to dictatorship.”\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n\r\n“What most of us find the most objectionable in the President’s\r\n[Truman’s] order is the ease with which it can be used to cover up\r\nblunders and incompetence, and the absence of any provision for\r\nremoving secrecy provisions after the emergency has passed. We may\r\nnow find our friends in other countries revealing information which\r\nwe are not permitted to publish or broadcast.”\r\n\r\nBender’s last sentence could not have been more prophetic. The\r\nmajority report hammered home the prophecy-come-true: “The British\r\nhave published substantially the same export-control list as that\r\nwhich our Government departments and agencies seek to hide and\r\nconceal from the American people.”\r\n\r\nOn the basis of consistency, reason, and logic the Eisenhower\r\nadministration’s broad use of “executive privilege” was by now\r\nthoroughly discredited. I did not see how President Eisenhower\r\nor anyone else could defend it, but I had not taken into account\r\nPresident Eisenhower’s lack of understanding of just what was taking\r\nplace under the cover of “executive privilege.” The President was\r\nexceedingly popular, and there were plenty of people who were willing\r\nto use his good name and reputation for honesty as a cover for their\r\nown errors, incompetence, misjudgments, or improprieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPressing a Point with Ike\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final reports from the four congressional investigations—a House\r\nGovernment Operations Committee, the Senate Dixon-Yates investigating\r\nsubcommittee, the McClellan subcommittee on East-West trade, and the\r\nWolf Ladejinsky probe—were all released during the summer of 1956.\r\nEach assailed the excessive arbitrary secrecy that had hampered the\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nSo, once again, at a press conference on September 27, 1956, I raised\r\nthe problem of arbitrary executive secrecy with President Eisenhower.\r\n\r\n“Mr. President,” I said. “At least four Congressional committees in a\r\nperiod of the last few weeks have issued reports that were critical\r\nof what they termed excessive secrecy which they felt covered up\r\nmismanagement in the operation of the Government.\r\n\r\n“Now, these committees contend that there is no court decision\r\nbacking the broad proposition of executive secrecy, and I wondered\r\nif you could tell us if you feel that all employees of the Federal\r\nGovernment, at their own discretion, can determine whether they\r\nwill testify or will not testify before committees when there is no\r\nsecurity problem involved?”\r\n\r\nThe President’s answer indicated that he was still not aware of the\r\nscope of the problem.\r\n\r\n“Well, I believe that the instructions are clear, that when there is\r\nno question of security, national security, involved, that everybody\r\nis supposed to testify freely before congressional committees. I will\r\nhave to look up the regulations, I mean the letters of instruction\r\nthat have gone out. Primarily, I think this is a function of the\r\ndepartment heads and the separate office heads—”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. President—” I tried to break in to correct him, but he\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe that any individual who happens to be, let’s say\r\nfrom a filing clerk on up can by themselves decide what is right for\r\nthem to tell and what is not right.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. President,” I explained. “They used the May 17, 1954, letter\r\nthat you wrote to Secretary Wilson in the Army-McCarthy hearings as\r\na precedent in this particular case. I wonder if you felt they were\r\nmisusing it if they use it, say, a clerk or an assistant secretary?”\r\n\r\nThe President was mildly irked at being pressed to comment on a\r\nspecific situation. “Now, you give me a very long and involved and\r\ndetailed question here at a place where I don’t even remember what I\r\nwrote to Secretary Wilson at that time. I will have to look it up. If\r\nyou will put your question ... in to Mr. Hagerty so we can look it\r\nup, why, it will be answered.”\r\n\r\nI was amazed that the President didn’t have a better grasp of the\r\nproblem at this late date. Dozens of government officials had been\r\nusing his name and his letter to Wilson as a justification for\r\nrefusing to produce records in a number of cases which had been\r\nheadline news, but he couldn’t remember what his policy was.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the press conference, I returned to the National Press\r\nBuilding and prepared my question for submission to Jim Hagerty. I\r\ndrafted the question with care so there could be no confusion as to\r\nthe points at issue, and delivered it to Hagerty at the White House.\r\nThe letter follows.\r\n\r\n  Mr. President: At least four congressional committees have issued\r\n  reports recently criticizing the executive agencies for what they\r\n  term “excessive secrecy” that can cover up mismanagement.\r\n\r\n  These committees contend that there are no court decisions to\r\n  support the broad contention of the “confidential executive\r\n  business” as set forth in your May 17, 1954, letter to Secretary\r\n  Wilson in the Army-McCarthy hearings.\r\n\r\n  The committees do not quarrel with your personal right to declare\r\n  specific acts or communications as “confidential.” They do argue\r\n  that many subordinate officials are wrongfully using the May\r\n  17, 1954, letter to claim that their government actions and\r\n  communications are “confidential.”\r\n\r\n  Some agencies have stated that Congress is entitled to “only final\r\n  decisions” of the agency, and has no right of access to papers\r\n  leading up to the decisions.\r\n\r\n  Do you feel that all employees of the Executive Branch have the\r\n  discretion to testify or not testify before Congress about their\r\n  official acts, when no security is involved?\r\n\r\n  At what level does this discretion lodge?\r\n\r\n  If you feel this is a misuse of the precedent, would you clarify\r\n  this matter on the access to information by the Congress and the\r\n  press?\r\n\r\nI knew the question would be answered by Gerald D. Morgan, the\r\nWhite House counsel, and I made several trips to the White House\r\nto convince him of the wisdom of limiting the use of “executive\r\nprivilege” to cases approved specifically by the President.\r\n\r\nMorgan seemed to be convinced at that stage that the Eisenhower\r\nadministration should put some bridle on the unrestrained use of\r\n“executive privilege” by officials at all levels. I argued that it\r\nwas to the advantage of the administration in power to have the\r\ncongressional committees actively policing the agencies, and that\r\nthere was grave danger of corruption developing in any agency where\r\nthose in charge felt they could arbitrarily block congressional\r\ninvestigators.\r\n\r\nMorgan asked that I send him a memorandum on the proper safeguards\r\nagainst improper use of “executive privilege.” I felt optimistic when\r\nI submitted the memorandum to Morgan October 4, 1956, and felt that\r\nperhaps the Eisenhower administration was willing to take action\r\npublicly to end this arbitrary secrecy.\r\n\r\nI had mentioned to Morgan that I had read the article he had written\r\nfor the California _Law Review_ of December 1949, in which he spoke\r\nforcefully in support of the power of Congress to compel testimony\r\nand production of records.\r\n\r\nMorgan’s article, entitled “Congressional Investigations and Judicial\r\nReview,” was written when he was an assistant legislative counsel to\r\nthe House of Representatives. In those years he had been a critic of\r\nthe Truman administration for excessive secrecy and a strong advocate\r\nof the power of Congress to investigate.\r\n\r\nIn his law review article, Morgan pulled apart the Supreme Court\r\ndecision in _Kilbourn v. Thompson_, a case decided in 1881. For\r\nyears this case had cast some doubt on the rights of the Congress to\r\nconduct broad investigations to carry out its legislative function.\r\nMorgan pointed out that _Kilbourn v. Thompson_ was a discredited\r\ndecision, and that the 1927 case of _McGrain v. Daugherty_ upheld the\r\nright of congressional committees to compel witnesses to testify and\r\nproduce records.\r\n\r\nThe case of _McGrain v. Daugherty_ arose out of the Teapot Dome\r\nscandal investigation of the 1920s. It was the same case that was\r\ncited by various congressional committees in 1956 as authority for\r\ninsisting on testimony and records from government agencies.\r\n\r\nThe letter Gerald Morgan wrote me was not what I wanted, and it\r\ncertainly was inconsistent with the principles he had set forth in\r\nhis 1949 law review article (see Appendix B). But it did demonstrate\r\nsome desire to come to grips with the problem. He wrote:\r\n\r\n“An employee is not free merely to exercise his own discretion (with\r\nregard to testimony and production of documents), but in the final\r\nanalysis information will be withheld only when the President or\r\nagency heads acting under the President’s authority or instruction\r\ndetermine it is contrary to the public interest to disclose it.”\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the letter suggested that information should be given\r\nto committees of Congress unless there was a specific order to\r\nthe contrary from the President, Congressman John Moss thought it\r\nportended an easing of the restrictions on information. At least he\r\nhoped it did. How futile was his hope we were soon to see.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Congress had to rely to a large extent on the\r\nJustice Department in normal moves to take court action against any\r\ngovernment officials who refused to give testimony. So, although the\r\ncase of _McGrain v. Daugherty_ upheld the right of Congress to demand\r\ntestimony and records, there was yet a practical problem involved.\r\nCongress had to depend on the good faith of the Attorney General and\r\nhis top aides to enforce its demand.\r\n\r\nA case in point occurred in the summer of 1956 when the Justice\r\nDepartment used the secrecy of “executive privilege” in an effort\r\nto block an investigation of a settlement of an antitrust suit. The\r\nantitrust suit involved American Telephone and Telegraph (A.T. & T.),\r\nand the investigation was being conducted by Representative Emanuel\r\nCeller’s antimonopoly subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee.\r\nChief Counsel Herbert Maletz was instructed by Celler to obtain the\r\nJustice Department files to determine the facts leading up to the\r\nsettlement of the A.T. & T. antitrust suit.\r\n\r\nThe suit had been initiated by the Department in 1949 for the\r\npurpose of forcing a divorce of A.T. & T. and its subsidiary, Western\r\nElectric. The separation was urged to break the near monopoly that\r\nWestern Electric enjoyed in the production of telephone equipment.\r\n\r\nThe suit had been hailed by Attorney General Herbert Brownell as a\r\ngreat victory for the government, but he and Deputy Attorney General\r\nWilliam P. Rogers claimed “executive privilege” and refused to make\r\nthe files available. They covered up the fact that the settlement\r\nallowing A.T. & T. to continue the ties with Western Electric was\r\nmade over the opposition of staff members in the Justice Department.\r\n\r\nAlthough Herbert Maletz was blocked from examining the files of the\r\nJustice Department, he managed to obtain much of the information he\r\nsought from the files of A.T. & T. and from records in the Defense\r\nDepartment. This outside probe uncovered some interesting things that\r\nJustice Department secrecy had hidden. It showed that a high official\r\nof A.T. & T. had written a letter which Defense Secretary Charles\r\nE. Wilson sent to the Justice Department urging settlement of the\r\nantitrust suit on terms favorable to A.T. & T. The investigation also\r\nrevealed the conversations between Attorney General Brownell and a\r\nlawyer for A.T. & T. that paved the way to settlement.\r\n\r\nBecause “executive privilege” blocked the Celler subcommittee from\r\nquestioning Justice Department employees, it was necessary to\r\nsubpoena a former official of the Justice Department to establish\r\nthat Brownell’s settlement was actually opposed by the working staff\r\nin the Antitrust Division. But who could override Brownell, the\r\nPresident’s chief legal adviser? The investigation stopped at the\r\ndoor of his office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Celler antimonopoly subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee\r\nran into “executive privilege” again when it started to investigate\r\nthe operations of the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) and the\r\nDepartment of Commerce.\r\n\r\nChairman Celler, an aggressive New York Democrat, was concerned over\r\nthe way the BAC was influencing policy in the Department of Commerce.\r\nHe questioned whether there were adequate safeguards against the\r\nmisuse of such a committee. Without the safeguards, it could become\r\na device for getting competitors together for price fixing or other\r\nviolations of the antitrust laws.\r\n\r\nChief Counsel Maletz, under directions from Celler, asked for the\r\nminutes of the meetings of the BAC and the details of the operations.\r\nThe subcommittee requests were rejected by Commerce Secretary\r\nSinclair Weeks on grounds that the BAC minutes were “confidential”\r\nbusiness of the executive branch of government.\r\n\r\nChairman Celler then argued that the BAC was a private committee, not\r\nsupported by government funds and not a government agency. He denied\r\nthat any “executive privilege” existed and declared that if it did\r\nexist, Secretary Weeks could not use it properly to try to cover up\r\nthe activities of a private group that happened to give some advice\r\nto a department of government.\r\n\r\nCommerce Secretary Weeks replied that BAC was a government committee,\r\nand that the minutes of BAC meetings therefore were covered by an\r\n“executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nPresumably the Celler antimonopoly subcommittee would have been\r\nallowed access to the minutes of the BAC if Weeks had considered it\r\na private business group. But in order to put those minutes out of\r\nthe reach of congressional inquiry Secretary Weeks was forced to\r\nthe ludicrous position of claiming that the private group became\r\na part of the government (and therefore entitled to an “executive\r\nprivilege”) merely by advising it.\r\n\r\nI had often used a quotation from Patrick Henry in talks on secrecy,\r\nbut it had never been more appropriate than now. Said Henry:\r\n\r\n“To cover with the veil of secrecy the common routine of business,\r\nis an abomination in the eyes of every intelligent man and every\r\nfriend to his country.”\r\n\r\nI was reminded also of these telling words of Edward Livingston:\r\n\r\n“No nation ever yet found any inconvenience from too close an\r\ninspection into the conduct of its officers. But many have been\r\nbrought to ruin, and reduced to slavery, by suffering gradual\r\nimposition and abuses which were imperceptible only because the means\r\nof publicity had not been secured.”\r\n\r\nOne could only wonder when President Eisenhower would awaken to the\r\nabuses of secrecy being perpetrated in his name, right under his own\r\nnose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nKeeping the Professor in the Dark\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Justice Department, Commerce Department, Agriculture Department,\r\nDefense Department, and State Department had all used the arbitrary\r\nsecrecy of “executive privilege” without causing a public uproar. Not\r\nonly had they succeeded in avoiding major press criticism, but they\r\nhad secured statements from President Eisenhower to give a noble and\r\npatriotic coloring to their deceptions.\r\n\r\nWith such encouragement at the top it was inevitable that the policy\r\nof secrecy would spread. In August 1957, the newly created House\r\nLegislative Oversight Subcommittee hired Bernard Schwartz, the young\r\nlaw professor from New York (see Chapter VIII), as counsel for an\r\ninvestigation of the various regulatory agencies. The committee,\r\nheaded by Representative Morgan Moulder, Missouri Democrat, had been\r\nestablished “to go into the administration of the laws [creating the\r\nregulatory agencies] and see whether or not the laws ... were being\r\ncarried out or whether they were being repealed or revamped by those\r\nwho administer them.”\r\n\r\nThe young professor had barely started his work in September 1957,\r\nwhen he began bumping into secrecy trouble. In all, there were six\r\nof the so-called “independent regulatory agencies” in the scope of\r\nthe House Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. The “big six” to be\r\nprobed were the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Civil\r\nAeronautics Board (CAB), the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC),\r\nthe Federal Power Commission (FPC), the Federal Trade Commission\r\n(FTC), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\r\n\r\nThe Congress had created these regulatory agencies to perform a\r\nwide range of functions including control of radio and television\r\nlicenses, control of gas and electric power lines, control of\r\ncommercial land transportation by train, truck, or bus, the\r\ninvestment market, and air transportation. Rights worth billions of\r\ndollars were involved in the decisions of these agencies, and it had\r\nbeen the stated intention of Congress to remove these decisions from\r\nthe direct pressure of politics. To do this, the regulatory agencies\r\nwere headed by bipartisan commissions or boards, the members of which\r\nwere nominated by the President, subject to approval by the Senate\r\nand limited to a fixed term of office.\r\n\r\nIn theory, at least, these boards or commissions were specialized\r\ncourts in their fields. They had rule-making and administrative\r\nfunctions, but they also rendered judicial decisions on the basis of\r\npublic records and public hearings. Once appointed, these members\r\nof the regulatory agencies were to be insulated from the pressure\r\npolitics of the White House and the Congress. Prior to Dr. Schwartz’s\r\narrival in Washington, there had been widespread reports, and some\r\nevidence, that members of some of the regulatory commissions were\r\nengaging in conversations with political personnel at the White House\r\nand elsewhere on cases under study. To Dr. Schwartz, an outstanding\r\nauthority in the field of administrative law, it was elementary that\r\nsuch conversations were improper while a case was being decided.\r\n\r\n“It is as bad as having one of the parties in a law suit sneak into\r\nthe chambers of the judge to try to influence his decision in the\r\nmiddle of a trial,” Dr. Schwartz told me.\r\n\r\nI discussed some incidents with him which I felt merited\r\ninvestigation, and he told me he was having trouble getting access to\r\nmaterial he requested. The CAB appeared ready to try to pull down a\r\nsecrecy curtain as broad as “executive privilege” because it could\r\nhave no legal substance for an independent regulatory agency.\r\n\r\nOn September 19, Dr. Schwartz requested that the CAB allow members\r\nof the House subcommittee staff “to receive and examine any records,\r\ndocuments, or information directly, or indirectly, pertaining to\r\nyour agency, function or business within the jurisdiction of this\r\nsubcommittee.”\r\n\r\nA few days later, on September 23, he pressed CAB Chairman James\r\nR. Durfee for full access to CAB records. Durfee insisted the CAB\r\nwould screen all files containing documents or communications from\r\nother agencies or departments of government. It was now apparent\r\nthat Durfee was going to refuse access to internal governmental\r\ncommunications on grounds of “executive privilege.” Dr. Schwartz was\r\nirate. He termed Chairman Durfee’s position “completely ridiculous”\r\nand suggested that Durfee obtain competent legal counsel.\r\n\r\nBy this time the pressure of the investigation was being felt by a\r\nnumber of the regulatory agencies. The chairmen of the six regulatory\r\nagencies met at a luncheon at the University Club in Washington the\r\nnext week to determine how to handle the inquisitive Dr. Schwartz.\r\nBecause of the success some government departments had been having\r\nwith “executive privilege” some of the chairmen decided that this\r\nwas to be the answer for their agencies, but there was no general\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nDr. Schwartz was not discouraged by the lack of information; he\r\nonly pressed harder. Subcommittee Chairman Morgan Moulder took the\r\nsuggestion of Dr. Schwartz and set October 17 as a public hearing\r\ndate for CAB. In the meantime, on October 5, he followed another\r\nSchwartz suggestion and asked that the CAB prepare and submit a\r\nreport on “all gifts, honorariums, loans, fees, or other payments”\r\nof things of value received by CAB employees from any “person,\r\nfirms, corporation, association, organization, or group having any\r\ninterest, direct or indirect,” in any matter before the board.\r\n\r\nDr. Schwartz was allowed to examine the public files, but his efforts\r\nto obtain files of correspondence with the White House and with other\r\nagencies ran into the claim of “executive privilege.” In the first\r\nmonths, he nevertheless became aware that Sherman Adams and others on\r\nthe White House staff had been extremely active in reaching various\r\nregulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nIn an exhaustive eighty-two-page “Memorandum of Law,” filed on\r\nOctober 17, Dr. Schwartz exposed the true nature of the “executive\r\nprivilege” arguments. They all sprang from the idea that “the King\r\ncan do no wrong.”\r\n\r\n“In the pretension of those who espouse ‘executive privilege,’” he\r\nsaid, “the infallibility recognized in the King in the days when\r\nhe was personally sovereign of England has been attributed to the\r\nPresident in our system. The reasoning which supports the doctrine\r\nshould shock the intelligence, as well as the sense of justice,\r\nof those who truly believe in the essentials of representative\r\ndemocracy.”\r\n\r\nHe reported that the CAB claimed “the authority to screen files\r\nand records before they are made available to the subcommittee,\r\nwith a right to the Board in its discretion to remove any and all\r\ndocuments” that could be considered personal files of Board members\r\nor communications within CAB or with the White House.\r\n\r\n“The Civil Aeronautics Board cannot claim privilege with regard to\r\ncommunication between the Board, on the one hand, and the President\r\nor other departments and agencies, on the other. Such an assertion of\r\nprivilege cannot defeat the right of this subcommittee to investigate\r\nthe relationship between the independent regulatory agencies and the\r\nexecutive branch.”\r\n\r\nSchwartz continued: “‘Executive privilege’ is not available to an\r\nindependent agency like the Civil Aeronautics Board as a possible\r\nbasis for the withholding of information from the Congress. The\r\nCivil Aeronautics Board, as the Supreme Court has recognized, is\r\nan independent agency whose members are not subject to the removal\r\npower of the President. Such a body cannot in any proper sense be\r\ncharacterized as an arm or an eye of the Executive. It is instead an\r\narm of the Congress, wholly responsible to that body.\r\n\r\n“The doctrine of absolute ‘executive privilege’ itself is not\r\nsupported in law. The cases cited by its proponents are not truly\r\nrelevant on the power of the Executive to withhold information from\r\nthe Congress. On the other hand, there are many decisions squarely\r\nrejecting the doctrine, even in courtroom cases. In addition, Dean\r\nWigmore (the leading authority on the subject in this country) flatly\r\nrepudiates the doctrine.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Dr. Schwartz did succeed in eliciting half-promises of\r\nco-operation from some officials of the regulatory agencies, most\r\nof them dragged their feet. Richard A. Mack, a member of the FCC,\r\nwouldn’t show investigators many of his records, including the office\r\ndiary that provided links for his indictment later on charges of\r\nhaving conspired to violate the federal law. The lack of co-operation\r\nby Commissioner Mack was matched by the resistance at CAB, where\r\nSchwartz was trying to pin down evidence of contacts by Sherman Adams.\r\n\r\nIn January 1958—after five months of frustration—Schwartz insisted\r\nthat the members of the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee get tough\r\nand demand full co-operation. Some members of the investigating\r\ncommittee did not want to force the issue. Several of the Republicans\r\ncame out flatly in support of the Eisenhower administration’s\r\nobstructionist tactics.\r\n\r\nThe lack of support from committee members so irritated Schwartz that\r\nit took only a little urging from some newsmen to get him to leak a\r\nstaff memorandum to The New York _Times_. It was a lengthy document\r\nsetting out the well-settled legal principle that it is improper for\r\nmembers of regulatory agencies to have private talks with litigants\r\nwhen a case is in hearing or in the process of being decided. The\r\nSchwartz memorandum also questioned the propriety of the members’\r\naccepting lavish entertainment from executives of the industries they\r\nwere supposed to regulate.\r\n\r\nTempers flared in the days following the leak of the Schwartz\r\nmemorandum, and finally on February 10, 1958, the House subcommittee\r\nvoted to fire Dr. Schwartz. I called Dr. Schwartz in the early\r\nevening of February 10 to inform him of the subcommittee’s decision\r\nand also to tell him that a subpoena was to be issued for him to\r\ntestify the next morning.\r\n\r\nHe told me he had copies of every important document from the\r\ncommittee files in a trunk and two cardboard boxes. “Someone should\r\nhave knowledge of what is in these records,” he said, “so it will\r\nbe possible to force the subcommittee to continue hearings.” If\r\nsomething dramatic wasn’t done, he was convinced the investigation\r\nwould never get off the ground.\r\n\r\nDr. Schwartz asked if I wanted the copies of documents to take to\r\nmembers of Congress who had shown an interest in the problems of the\r\nregulatory agencies. I said I should not take possession of documents\r\nwhich might be considered the property of the House subcommittee. But\r\nsince the documents were legally in his custody, I suggested that he\r\ncould take them to the apartment of Senator John J. Williams, the\r\nDelaware Republican, and I would be happy to accompany him.\r\n\r\nI had talked with Senator Williams of improper pressure on the\r\nregulatory agencies and thought he would take the records. He had\r\nfought against tax scandals in the Truman administration, but I\r\nregarded him as an objective crusader who would call the strikes\r\nthe same way if the Eisenhower administration were involved in\r\nwrongdoing. I had hoped that Senator Williams might be able to give\r\nthe investigation of regulatory agencies the same prodding that he\r\nhad given to the House tax scandals investigations in 1951 and 1952.\r\n\r\nDr. Schwartz said he would be willing to turn the papers over to\r\nSenator Williams and explain them to him in detail.\r\n\r\nI headed at once for his apartment. When I arrived, Dr. Schwartz had\r\nthe trunk and two boxes of documents ready to go. Mrs. Schwartz was\r\nnervous about her husband’s going, however. I assured her that for\r\npractical political reasons it was unlikely that the House would take\r\naction against Dr. Schwartz for delivering the documents to a United\r\nStates Senator. As quickly as possible we carried the heavy trunk and\r\nboxes to my car. At the Mayflower Hotel, we hired a porter to wheel\r\nthem on a baggage cart to the apartment of Senator Williams. While\r\nwe were at the Williams apartment, Dr. Schwartz received an urgent\r\ntelephone call from his wife. He took it in private in another room.\r\nMrs. Schwartz said she had been called by a reporter who told her\r\nthat since Senator Williams was a Republican, he would probably turn\r\nthe documents over to Sherman Adams at the White House. The fear\r\nwas groundless, but Mrs. Schwartz was frantic and made her husband\r\npromise to leave the Williams apartment and take the documents with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDr. Schwartz returned to the room and told the Senator it had been\r\nsuggested that the documents might be taken to Senator Wayne Morse,\r\nthe Oregon Democrat. We excused ourselves to go telephone Senator\r\nMorse and left Senator Williams alone with the documents. I made the\r\ncall. As I was certain he would—for I had previously talked with\r\nhim about the regulatory agency scandals—Morse assured me he was\r\ninterested in reviewing any documents Schwartz had available.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at his apartment, Senator Morse greeted us calmly\r\nand assured us that he wanted the documents because of his official\r\ninterest in the regulatory agencies, and we left them with him.\r\nNow we felt certain we had created a situation in which it would\r\nbe virtually impossible for the House to avoid going forward with\r\nthe investigation. The word would move fast that the files had been\r\nexamined by a leading Democratic Senator and a leading Republican\r\nSenator. It would create a good many complex problems for any House\r\nmembers inclined to ignore or hide the evidence and leads that\r\nSchwartz had accumulated.\r\n\r\nBefore the Schwartz files were returned to the House subcommittee,\r\nSenator Morse read them. It was reported to me that most, if not\r\nall, of the documents were photographed before they were sent on to\r\nRepresentative Oren Harris, the Arkansas Democrat who was chairman of\r\nthe House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.\r\n\r\nUntil now it appeared Sherman Adams had erected a total shield from\r\ninvestigations by Congress. He had used “executive privilege” to\r\navoid testimony in the Dixon-Yates case. He had been able to make his\r\ncontacts at the Securities and Exchange Commission without undergoing\r\nquestioning by the investigating subcommittee which was examining why\r\nthe SEC had postponed a hearing on Dixon-Yates at a crucial point.\r\n\r\nIt was Sherman Adams who scribbled his initials on papers to indicate\r\nhe had approved them for President Eisenhower’s signature. Sherman\r\nAdams was on the telephone daily to United States senators and\r\ncongressmen on knotty legislative and patronage matters. Sherman\r\nAdams ironed out the problems between cabinet officers, and he dipped\r\nhis hand into virtually every department from the first months of\r\nthe Eisenhower administration. Always it was understood that Sherman\r\nAdams was speaking for President Eisenhower, or was acting for\r\nPresident Eisenhower. Even when he didn’t say, “This is what the\r\nPresident wants,” it was understood he was speaking for President\r\nEisenhower.\r\n\r\nThe legend grew that Sherman Adams was cold and clean as New\r\nHampshire granite—a barrier against the corrupting influence of\r\npersonal and political favoritism. Coming on the heels of the Truman\r\nadministration, such a reputation was much admired even when it was\r\nknown that Adams was not well liked. There were countless stories\r\nof his undiplomatic, even rude, treatment of Republican political\r\nfigures who were interested in a return to some good plain political\r\npatronage. It all added to the legend that Sherman Adams was one of\r\nthe finest influences the Eisenhower administration had brought to\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nBut there were also those stories of the calls that Sherman Adams\r\nmade on members of the so-called “independent regulatory agencies.”\r\nOne might commend the White House for keeping a firm hand on agencies\r\ndirectly under the control of the White House, but the regulatory\r\nagencies were another matter. Politics were supposed to be kept out.\r\n\r\nShortly after the midnight ride with Dr. Schwartz, I came into the\r\npossession of copies of two letters from “Sherm” Adams to “Murray”\r\nChotiner, an attorney for North American Airlines. In the letters,\r\n“Sherm” had informed “Murray” that he had discussed the North\r\nAmerican Airlines case with the acting head of the CAB. It appeared\r\nto be a one-party contact with an official of the CAB during the\r\nperiod when a case was being decided. It appeared to be a direct\r\nviolation of the rules of the CAB if Adams had done what he stated\r\nin the letter he had done for Chotiner, a politically influential\r\nCalifornia lawyer. I wrote my story on the facts available in the\r\nsecret files of the House subcommittee.\r\n\r\nI caught President Eisenhower’s eye early in the February 26, 1958,\r\npress conference and he recognized me with a trace of reluctance.\r\n\r\n“Mr. President,” I started. “Sherman Adams has written a letter in\r\nwhich he states that he went over the details of a pending Civil\r\nAeronautics Board matter with an acting chairman of the CAB.\r\n\r\n“It is contended up on Capitol Hill, that this was a violation of a\r\nCAB rule which states—it is improper that there be any communication,\r\nprivate communication that is, by any private or public person with\r\na member of the CAB, with the examiners of the CAB, with the staff\r\nwhile the case is pending, except in those matters prescribed by law.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if you could tell us whether you felt Mr. Adams was acting\r\nwithin the proper scope of his authority in this particular matter.”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower pleaded ignorance of news stories that had been\r\non page one for days:\r\n\r\n“Well, again you are bringing up a thing I have not heard of; but I\r\nwill say this: There is a number of cases that come under the CAB\r\nthat the White House must act on. Any time that they refer or have\r\nanything to do with the foreign routes that CAB has authorized, or\r\nrefused to authorize, then the President himself is required to make\r\nthe final judgment.”\r\n\r\nThe President was confused. He was assuming that the case was a\r\nforeign airline route case to which normal rules do not apply. The\r\ncase about which Adams had written the letter, however, involved a\r\ndomestic airline, North American Airlines.\r\n\r\n“And, very naturally,” President Eisenhower continued, “my staff\r\nwould want to get any additional information that I need. So, I would\r\nassume it is so on that case.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. President,” I broke in to explain that the North American case\r\nwas not a foreign line, but was a domestic airline. “On that line—”\r\n\r\nI was cut off by the President’s cold stare, and abrupt comment: “I\r\ndon’t want anything more about that.”\r\n\r\nThere was no opportunity to ask another question, but the record was\r\nmuch clearer to the nation’s editorial writers and cartoonists than\r\nit was to President Eisenhower.\r\n\r\n“Whether the President wants it or not, there ought to be ‘more\r\nabout that’ at the very next news conference,” commented the St.\r\nLouis _Post Dispatch_ in a hard-hitting editorial. The editorial\r\npointed out that in the face of rules that would make Adams’ contacts\r\n“improper,” President Eisenhower had “not only evaded a direct\r\nquestion about whether Mr. Adams’ intercession was improper but\r\nhaving evaded it, told Reporter Mollenhoff: ‘I don’t want anything\r\nmore about that.’”\r\n\r\nThe Washington _Post_ commented that President Eisenhower’s answer\r\n“gave a damning indictment of his own unfamiliarity with important\r\nnational affairs yesterday in his fuzzy comments on the relationship\r\nof Sherman Adams to the Civil Aeronautics Board.\r\n\r\n“For days there have been stories about the accusation by Dr. Bernard\r\nSchwartz that Mr. Adams in 1953 discussed the status of North\r\nAmerican Airlines with the acting chairman of the CAB on behalf of\r\nthe airlines counsel, Murray Chotiner. Yet Mr. Eisenhower said,\r\nalmost incredibly, that he had never heard of the matter.”\r\n\r\nThe _Post_ editorial concluded:\r\n\r\n“Is it that Mr. Eisenhower just isn’t interested, or is it that Mr.\r\nAdams, who attempts to ease the Chief Executive’s burdens, filters\r\nwhat the President reads?”\r\n\r\nReports were already circulating in Washington that Sherman Adams\r\nhad made some contacts at two other regulatory agencies on behalf of\r\nBernard Goldfine, a wealthy New England industrialist. However, the\r\nclaim of “executive privilege” still spread its protective covering\r\nover Sherman Adams and others at the White House. The officials of\r\nthe regulatory agencies continued to refuse to give testimony on\r\ncontacts with the White House. And, of course, at that stage Sherman\r\nAdams had no intention of giving public testimony.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, the House investigation became a hot issue. Evidence\r\nwas developed that Richard A. Mack, a member of the FCC, had been\r\ninvolved in some rather complicated financial dealings with a Miami\r\nattorney, Thurman A. Whiteside. Whiteside had loaned him money, and\r\nthere was also an arrangement through an insurance firm which was\r\nputting a little extra money in Mack’s pocket. Whiteside checks\r\ntotaling $2650 were received by Mack while he was on the FCC, and\r\nWhiteside also gave him a one-sixth interest in an insurance company\r\nthat sold $20,000 worth of insurance to one of the applicants in the\r\nFCC case involving Miami Channel 10.\r\n\r\nThis case was to lead to the indictment of Mack and Whiteside for\r\nalleged conspiracy to fix the award by FCC on Miami Channel 10. Mack\r\nwas forced to resign from the FCC after a pathetic appearance before\r\nthe House Legislative Oversight Subcommittee.\r\n\r\nIn the criminal trial, Mack admitted receiving financial help and\r\n“loans” from Whiteside, but contended that it had nothing to do with\r\nthe award of Channel 10 in Miami to Public Service Television, Inc.\r\nMack contended it was merely an extension of the favors Whiteside had\r\ngiven him since they were boyhood friends. The first trial ended in a\r\nhung jury.\r\n\r\nThe former FCC member never went to trial again. In court he was\r\ndescribed as ill and alcoholic, and unable to stand the ordeal of a\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nWhiteside was tried a second time, and was acquitted on the criminal\r\ncharge. A short time later, in May 1961, Whiteside was found dead in\r\nhis Miami office. Death was caused by a self-inflicted bullet wound.\r\n\r\nThe FCC in a later ruling ordered Public Service Television to stop\r\nusing Channel 10. The FCC had concluded that the activities of Mack,\r\nWhiteside, and others constituted improper conduct in connection with\r\nthe application of Public Service Television.\r\n\r\nThe United States Court of Appeals upheld the FCC ruling that Public\r\nService and two other applicants had disqualified themselves by\r\nimproper practices. The Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal.\r\n\r\nDr. Schwartz and his investigators had pinned down the essential\r\ndetails on the Mack case before Schwartz was fired, and the hearings\r\ndemonstrated fully the type of activity that at least one of the\r\nregulatory agencies had concealed with the claim of “executive\r\nprivilege.” By this time, it was clear to everyone that there were\r\na good many things wrong with the operations of the “big six”\r\nregulatory agencies. There was no proof that they were filled with\r\ncorruption, but there was adequate evidence of a widespread laxity\r\nthat needed to be examined and exposed.\r\n\r\nThere had been only the rumors of the Adams-Goldfine relationship\r\nwhile Dr. Schwartz was with the House subcommittee, but once the\r\nhearings on Mack were moving, the whole subject of one-party contacts\r\nwith regulatory agencies came in for closer scrutiny.\r\n\r\nReports that Adams had received a vicuña coat and a $2400 oriental\r\nrug from Goldfine evoked interest in Goldfine. These reports were\r\nfollowed by the revelation that Goldfine had lavishly entertained\r\nAdams at hotels in New York and Boston, and during the same period of\r\ntime Adams had made inquiries for Goldfine at the SEC and FTC.\r\n\r\nSherman Adams whipped out a letter which he believed would still the\r\noutcry against him. It was a vague letter that simply admitted he\r\nhad contacted the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and\r\nExchange Commission on some of Goldfine’s problems. However, Adams\r\nsaid he had requested no favors for his friend Goldfine, but ignored\r\nthe fact that any call from Sherman Adams would flag a case for\r\nspecial attention. The benefits known to have been received by Adams\r\nwere small, but his relationship with the notorious Goldfine was to\r\nbecome a source of continued embarrassment to the White House. The\r\nembarrassment finally forced Adams out of the White House into the\r\nopen arena of congressional questioners.\r\n\r\nAdams went before the House Legislative Oversight Subcommittee in the\r\ncrowded House Caucus Room. It was his first time to give testimony,\r\nand he hoped that it would stop the criticism. President Eisenhower\r\nadmitted that Adams had been “imprudent” in his relationship with\r\nGoldfine. But, the President said, “I need him.”\r\n\r\nNow nothing could stop the criticism, public and private. It seemed\r\nthat every week brought more and more revelations of the questionable\r\nactivities of Bernard Goldfine. There were charges of mislabeling\r\nof woolen goods filed by the FTC, and records showed Goldfine firms\r\ninvolved in a long series of mislabeling incidents. Goldfine had not\r\nfiled proper reports with the SEC for several years. Also, Goldfine\r\nhad refused to testify on a mysterious $700,000 in cashier’s and\r\ntreasurer’s checks he had taken out of his businesses.\r\n\r\nHailed before the committee, Goldfine took the Fifth Amendment,\r\nclaiming that to answer the questions might tend to incriminate him.\r\nEvery day that Bernard Goldfine was on the witness stand or otherwise\r\nin the public eye was pure misery for the Republican political party.\r\nIt was apparent that the Republicans would be saddled with Goldfine\r\nas long as Sherman Adams remained the number one assistant to\r\nPresident Eisenhower.\r\n\r\nAnd so, on September 22, 1958, Sherman Adams resigned. In a\r\nnationwide television broadcast, he said he had “done no wrong” but\r\nwas the victim of “a campaign of vilification.”\r\n\r\nOnly five days later, a federal grand jury in the District of\r\nColumbia returned the indictment charging Richard Mack, the former\r\nFCC commissioner, with conspiracy to defraud the government. The\r\nindictment charged that Thurman A. Whiteside, a Miami lawyer, had\r\nbought Mack’s vote in connection with the award of Miami television\r\nChannel 10.\r\n\r\nSome people paid a heavy price for what had once seemed to them to be\r\nclever secretive manipulations to influence governmental decisions.\r\nWhiteside crumpled under the strain and died by his own hand. Mack\r\ncringed before the court with a plea that he was too ill and too\r\nalcoholic to stand trial.\r\n\r\nEven a million-dollar fortune couldn’t save Bernard Goldfine from\r\nthe disgrace of a federal prison term. He hired the most expensive\r\nlawyers and engaged in every conceivable maneuver to stay out of\r\nprison, but in the end lost his freedom and his “friends.” He went\r\nto prison on a criminal charge of evading more than $800,000 in\r\nfederal taxes. Although he had boasted bravely that he would not\r\nco-operate with the Justice Department in explaining what he did\r\nwith the missing $800,000, his health broke while in prison and\r\nleft him a shattered shell of his former self. Later the Internal\r\nRevenue Service filed liens against his property totaling more than\r\n$7,000,000. The Goldfine magic had turned to mud.\r\n\r\nThese cases had dramatized the full evil of secret government. The\r\nproblems of Adams rose directly from the failure of the White House\r\nto recognize the dangers involved. It was not necessary to read evil\r\nintent into the origin of the blanket secrecy. It was bad enough that\r\nthe Administration had so self-satisfiedly assumed that things were\r\nbeing handled efficiently and properly and that the press and the\r\nCongress were better off kept in the dark where they couldn’t stir up\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nIke’s Lawyer and the Law\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Pierce Rogers was nominated to be United States Attorney\r\nGeneral in the fall of 1957. He had served as Deputy Attorney General\r\nunder Herbert Brownell from the time the Eisenhower administration\r\ncame to power in January 1953. When he was nominated for the top\r\npost, he was forty-five years old and had been included by President\r\nEisenhower on a select list of bright young Republicans qualified as\r\npresidential or vice presidential timber for 1960. He was regarded as\r\nthe closest friend of Vice President Richard Nixon.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Rogers nomination had\r\nbarely started on January 22, 1958, when Senator Estes Kefauver\r\nraised the question of the Eisenhower administration’s broad use of\r\n“executive privilege.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Rogers,” the Tennessee Senator said, “many of us in the Senate\r\nand in the House have been increasingly alarmed over the expansion\r\nof the pleading of privilege on information which congressional\r\ncommittees desire, and feel they have a right to have.”\r\n\r\nSenator Kefauver explained the philosophy behind the need for full\r\ninformation in a democracy, and then moved to the specific problem:\r\n\r\n“I think we all appreciate the fact that under the precedent that\r\nwhen the President has matters up with his Cabinet that he wants to\r\nwithhold them from public inspection, he has that right; but we find\r\nhere on numerous occasions when the arms of Congress—the Securities\r\nand Exchange Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the\r\nCivil Aeronautics Board, and various and sundry agencies set up by\r\nthe Congress to administer laws which our Congress has the prime\r\nresponsibility for administering—they, themselves, are asserting the\r\nprivilege and they are deciding whether they want to withhold the\r\ninformation or not—things the President does not even know anything\r\nabout—so that committees of Congress are being hampered in their\r\neffort to get information.”\r\n\r\nSenator Kefauver started to read from a report of the House\r\nGovernment Operations Committee: “The most flagrant abuse of the\r\nso-called legal authority is the misuse of the May 17, 1954,\r\nletter from the President to the Secretary of Defense at the time\r\nof the Army-McCarthy controversy.... It seems inconceivable that\r\n19 Government departments and agencies would cite this letter as\r\na shadowy cloak of authority to restrict or withhold information\r\nfrom the Congress and the public. This flimsy pretext of so-called\r\nlegal authority only serves to demonstrate to what extent executive\r\ndepartments and agencies will go to restrict or withhold information.”\r\n\r\nSenator Everett Dirksen, the Illinois Republican, interrupted to\r\nemphasize that it was a House committee report Senator Kefauver was\r\nreading, and that “I want to have that clear.”\r\n\r\nSenator Kefauver continued: “We had a case here [meaning among\r\nSenate committees], where the head of the Securities and Exchange\r\nCommission pled privilege to his conversation with Sherman Adams,\r\nwhen apparently Mr. Adams was trying to get a hearing postponed in a\r\nquasi-legislative agency.\r\n\r\n“We have a report by Senator Olin Johnston’s committee in which they\r\ntake great exception to the pleading of privilege by Mr. [R. W.\r\nScott] McLeod in the Ladejinsky case with which you are familiar. We\r\nhad the Al Sarena [mining land grant] plea of privilege. We had some\r\npleas of privilege in connection with Mr. Gordon Gray when he was\r\ndealing with rapid tax amortization, so it is getting to the point,\r\nMr. Rogers, where not the President but any of these agencies ...\r\nanybody who does not want any information to be made public, just\r\npleads privilege.”\r\n\r\nSenator Dirksen intervened to volunteer comment “before the Attorney\r\nGeneral replies, because I was a part of the proceeding on the\r\nMcCarthy committee, and I was a part of the proceeding involving the\r\nChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.”\r\n\r\n“If it is all the same to Senator Dirksen, I had rather ask my\r\nquestions, and you may ask them in your time,” Kefauver replied.\r\n\r\n“I do not think there has been any great tendency [to secrecy] in the\r\nlast few years,” Rogers said. “I was counsel for committees in ...\r\n1947, 1948, and 1949 ... and I do not believe that the problems are\r\nmuch different now and then.”\r\n\r\nThen Rogers sought to postpone further discussion. “I would like, I\r\nthink maybe in the interest of time, to delay a full discussion of\r\nthis, because I have agreed with Senator Hennings to appear before\r\nhis committee to discuss this whole matter.”\r\n\r\nSenator Kefauver said he would be glad to see the whole matter\r\nexamined thoroughly by Senator Hennings, but added: “I do think at\r\nthis time on such an important matter that you should give us some\r\nexpression of your position, or what your position will be.”\r\n\r\n“On the general subject matter,” Rogers began, “I believe in\r\nthe value of congressional investigations.... I think they have\r\ncontributed a great deal to the success of our country, and I think\r\nthat the executive branch of the Government has the responsibility to\r\nmake the information available to congressional committees to the\r\nfullest extent that it is possible to do so.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand,” Rogers went on, “I think that the history of\r\nthe country has indicated that there are exceptions, and that those\r\nexceptions have been recognized by each administration throughout\r\nhistory. I do not think that there is any reason why there should be\r\nmuch general disagreement, and I think if we had a chance to discuss\r\nthose things in detail that probably our views would be pretty much\r\nthe same.”\r\n\r\nSenator Kefauver asked Rogers about the use of “executive privilege”\r\nby officials of the so-called independent regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\n“Well,” Rogers said, “I think that possibly there ought to be an\r\neven greater attempt made to give all the information to Congress\r\npossible, in those agencies.... I think you can make mistakes of\r\njudgment if you generalize too much on those things, and I think\r\nthere has been a tendency to do that.\r\n\r\n“I remember debating the subject with Russ Wiggins ... he and Mr.\r\nClark Mollenhoff have been the leaders, and when you get down to it\r\nthere is not too much in the way of fact. There has been a lot of\r\ngeneral observation, but I would like to come up, if you do not mind,\r\nand discuss this at length with Senator Hennings’ subcommittee.”\r\n\r\nI knew that Russ Wiggins was well informed on the specific instances\r\nof arbitrary withholding. I had tried to discuss a number of specific\r\ncases with Rogers but always found him unavailable. Additionally,\r\nSenator Hennings had found some difficulty in getting an agreement\r\nfrom Rogers to appear before his Judiciary subcommittee.\r\n\r\n“I had not quite understood from your last letter,” Senator Hennings\r\ntold the nominee, “that you were willing to appear before the\r\nConstitutional Rights Subcommittee. You did not say that you would\r\nnot [appear], but I did not quite understand you to say that you\r\nwould.”\r\n\r\nRogers’ nomination was confirmed by the Senate, and by the time he\r\nappeared before the Hennings subcommittee six weeks later he had\r\nbecome the leading spokesman for the ultimate in secrecy under the\r\nclaim of “executive privilege.” Rogers claimed that the executive\r\nbranch of the government could properly refuse to give Congress any\r\ndocument that included any advice, recommendation, or conclusion.\r\nAlthough the Constitution says nothing about such a right, Rogers\r\ncontended that the executive branch did have an “inherent right” to\r\nrefuse to give testimony or produce records. He further contended\r\nthat no law of Congress could force production of such records.\r\n\r\nThis in essence was the position he presented to the Constitutional\r\nRights Subcommittee on March 6, 1958. In addition, smiling,\r\nback-patting Bill Rogers now also claimed that the so-called\r\nindependent regulatory agencies—the FCC, ICC, SEC, CAB, FTC, and\r\nFPC—could exercise “executive privilege.” Such a position at the\r\nnomination hearing might have created serious problems on his\r\nconfirmation, for at that time the House Legislative Oversight\r\nSubcommittee was engaged in the probe of White House and political\r\ninfluence on the regulatory agencies recounted in the foregoing\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nAt issue when Rogers testified on March 6 was the question of whether\r\nthe Congress should amend the “Housekeeping Statute” (5 U.S.C. 22)\r\nby stating that this statute covering custody of records could not\r\nbe used as a justification for withholding records from Congress or\r\nthe public. Rogers opposed the amendment but said that if it passed,\r\nit still could not interfere with the broad right he claimed under\r\n“executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nWhen Representative George Meader, the Michigan Republican, learned\r\nof the Rogers testimony he was enraged. Meader and Rogers had both\r\nserved as counsel for Senate investigating committees in the late\r\n1940s, and Meader had firsthand knowledge of the investigations\r\nthat Rogers conducted of the Truman administration. He also knew\r\nthat Rogers had been sharply critical of secrecy in the Truman\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n“Curious things seem to happen to individuals when they move from one\r\nend of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other,” said Representative Meader.\r\nHe urged the Congress to “strike down” Rogers’ claim with legislation\r\ndeclaring specifically that records must be given to Congress. He\r\nreferred to the “executive privilege” as “nonexistent imagery” which\r\nhad no support in the Constitution, in the laws, or in the decisions\r\nof the federal courts. Throwing aside all political partisanship,\r\nRepublican Meader told the House that if the Rogers doctrine\r\nprevailed the executive will “become the master, not the servant, of\r\nthe people.”\r\n\r\nSenator Thomas C. Hennings, whose subcommittee had heard the Rogers\r\ntestimony, was equally alarmed. A few days after the hearings\r\nHennings received a letter from Rogers designed “to clarify” his\r\ntestimony. On March 6, Rogers had testified:\r\n\r\n“Now I don’t recall any instance when Washington, Jefferson or Truman\r\nor anyone else ever relied upon this [the Housekeeping Statute] as a\r\nbasis for ‘executive privilege’ for withholding information. It is\r\nsomething entirely different. This is a bookkeeping statute which\r\nsays they keep the records, they hold them physically. It doesn’t\r\nrelate at all to ‘executive privilege’.”\r\n\r\nWhile stating that the Housekeeping Statute included no right to\r\nwithhold information, Rogers in the same hearing admitted that it\r\nhad been erroneously used by officials who had meant to use the\r\n“executive privilege” to keep government records secret.\r\n\r\nIn a letter that followed his testimony, however, Rogers completely\r\nreversed himself and stated that the Housekeeping Statute is “a\r\nlegislative expression and recognition of the ‘executive privilege’.”\r\n\r\nHennings replied that Rogers’ letter of explanation was\r\n“incompatible” with his testimony. He said that Rogers’ letter was\r\nnot only “inconsistent” from a legal standpoint, but “completely\r\nbaffling when compared with his oral testimony. In almost two\r\nyears of investigations and study of the subject of freedom of\r\ninformation,” Hennings continued, “I have come across a number of\r\ncases where various misguided, secrecy-minded executive department\r\nofficials, eagerly seeking authority to justify withholding\r\ninformation from the Congress and the public have tortured the\r\nsimple provisions of the [law] ... beyond all recognition. This\r\ninterpretation now offered by the Attorney General in his letter\r\nsurpasses all of these others so far.”\r\n\r\nOn the specific point at issue, Chairman Hennings wrote that\r\nhe believed the Housekeeping Statute had no connection with\r\nconstitutional claims of “executive privilege.” “I am amazed at the\r\nAttorney General’s assertion that it does. I think the Attorney\r\nGeneral’s letter presents overwhelming proof of the urgent need to\r\namend [the law] ... to make clear beyond any doubt that Congress\r\nintended it to be merely a housekeeping statute and not an instrument\r\nof censorship.”\r\n\r\nRogers’ testimony had sent his critics scurrying to the records.\r\nWhen he was chief counsel for a Senate subcommittee investigating a\r\nloyalty case in the Truman administration, Rogers had been balked\r\nby an executive order issued by President Truman barring Congress\r\nfrom personnel files in loyalty investigations. The records showed\r\nthat Rogers had fought against this secrecy, limited as it was. The\r\ncommittee report, written under his direction, stated:\r\n\r\n“Congress is entitled to know the facts giving rise to the requests\r\nand to satisfy itself by firsthand information that the reasons are\r\nvalid. Any other course blinds the legislative branch and permits\r\naction only when the president provides a ‘seeing-eye dog’ in the\r\nform of a request for legislation required by the executive.\r\n\r\n“If the subcommittee is denied the right to examine the facts in\r\nspecific cases where there appears to be a breakdown in the loyalty\r\nprogram, it cannot make a complete appraisal of the program.”\r\n\r\nI had the switch in Rogers’ thinking very much in mind when, less\r\nthan a month after his appearance, the Hennings subcommittee called\r\nme to testify as a representative of the freedom of information\r\ncommittee of the national journalism fraternity, Sigma Delta Chi.\r\nI told the subcommittee I opposed any general legislation to allow\r\nofficials to hide records, and felt that in those areas where secrecy\r\nis needed it could be covered by specific legislation.\r\n\r\n“We have seen the proof year after year,” I testified, “that the\r\nunlimited grant of the right to hide the record will lead to abuse of\r\npower, corruption and mismanagement.\r\n\r\n“Of course, the Attorney General tells us he does not believe that\r\nsecrecy is being used to hide errors or crimes in the executive\r\nbranch of Government. Mr. Rogers felt different about this ten years\r\nago. Then he was ... busy digging out and exposing the crimes,\r\nfavoritism, and errors which he felt were being covered up by\r\nsecrecy.... We might say that Mr. Rogers was highly successful.”\r\n\r\nI continued:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Rogers may feel things are different today. However, we can\r\nnever trust the judgment of those in power who might be inclined\r\nto make self-serving declarations on their own virtues. This has\r\nhappened often in the past. We know now that at least eight or ten\r\ncongressional committees have made it clear they are not as sure as\r\nMr. Rogers that secrecy is not being used to hide crimes, favoritism,\r\nand blunders today.\r\n\r\n“It is not necessary to arrive at any conclusion on the virtues of\r\nthis administration or any administration, to conclude that secret\r\ngovernment is not in keeping with democracy.\r\n\r\n“Even if we accept an administration’s declaration on the many\r\nvirtues it possesses, we must be guided by this principle: ‘Never\r\ntrust a good man to make secret decisions for you, if it would\r\nfrighten you to lodge the same power in an evil man or a man who is\r\non the other side of the political fence.’”\r\n\r\nIn the course of my testimony, Senator Roman Hruska, the Nebraska\r\nRepublican, sought to defend the Eisenhower administration’s claim of\r\n“executive privilege” in the May 17, 1954, letter:\r\n\r\n“He [President Eisenhower] directed that the Secretary of the Army\r\ninstruct his employees not to disclose information, and the large\r\nsegment of the American press at that time hailed that decision as\r\nbeing something very fine and very wise and very just.”\r\n\r\nNo one was going to get me to defend those uninformed editorials\r\nthat had been based on the belief that the May 17, 1954, letter was\r\na single shot of secrecy aimed at Senator McCarthy. I was on much\r\nfirmer ground when the subject switched to the case of _McGrain v.\r\nDaugherty_ (1927) in which the Supreme Court stated that the power to\r\ncompel witnesses to produce records and testify is a necessary part\r\nof the legislative function.\r\n\r\n“Under the Rogers doctrine, the Congress is reduced to a third-rate\r\ndivision of Government,” I said. “Its investigations can be limited\r\nto what officials in the executive branch of the Government feel\r\nit is wise to produce. If the Government has full discretion as to\r\nwhich facts will be made available to the public, the press, or the\r\nCongress, then there is no more than half freedom [to investigate].\r\n\r\n“I do not want to be limited in my reporting to the self-serving\r\ndeclaration from men like Richard A. Mack as to what a fine job is\r\nbeing done at the Federal Communications Commission.\r\n\r\n“I do not want to be limited to the comments of T. Lamar Caudle,\r\nAssistant Attorney General under the Truman administration, as\r\nto what a fine job is being done in the prosecution of tax-law\r\nviolations.\r\n\r\n“I do not want to be limited to the comments of Harold Talbott,\r\nformer Air Force Secretary, as to how he is handling Air Force\r\nprocurement.\r\n\r\n“I do not want to be limited to the statements of former Secretary\r\nof Interior Fall that the handling of Teapot Dome oil reserves was\r\nreally in the public interest.”\r\n\r\nAlso called to testify for Sigma Delta Chi was V. M. (Red) Newton,\r\nthe managing editor of the Tampa _Tribune_. Herbert Brucker, editor\r\nof the Hartford _Courant_, testified on behalf of the American\r\nSociety of Newspaper Editors. And Harold Cross, the able lawyer for\r\nthe A.S.N.E., submitted a legal analysis.\r\n\r\nNearly all newspaper, broadcasting, and legal organizations favored\r\nthe Moss-Hennings amendment to the Housekeeping Statute. It passed\r\nCongress with ease despite Administration opposition and on August\r\n12, 1958, President Eisenhower signed it.\r\n\r\nThe amendment to the Housekeeping Statute said simply: “This section\r\ndoes not authorize the withholding of information from the public or\r\nlimiting the availability of records to the public.” However, as he\r\nsigned it into law, President Eisenhower said: “It is not intended\r\nto, and indeed could not, alter the existing power of the head of\r\nan executive department to keep appropriate information or papers\r\nconfidential in the public interest. The power in the executive\r\nbranch is inherent under the Constitution.”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower had obviously accepted the Rogers theory in\r\nfull. He had accepted the misleading precedents set out in a Justice\r\nDepartment memorandum in which it was represented to him that George\r\nWashington had started all this withholding from Congress. He had\r\nbeen convinced by his subordinates that the “executive privilege”\r\nclaims made between 1954 and 1958 usurped no more authority than\r\nGeorge Washington had. And he had been convinced by some of his\r\nadvisers that he would be weakening the presidency if he did not\r\nstand by the extreme “executive privilege” doctrine.\r\n\r\nRobert Donovan, in his book _The Inside Story_, related that\r\nPresident Eisenhower “told the Cabinet he wanted it clearly\r\nunderstood that he was never going to yield to the point where he\r\nwould become known as a President who had practically crippled the\r\nPresidency.” This determination accounted for President Eisenhower’s\r\nfrequent use of the comment that he was merely reiterating a\r\nprinciple used by Presidents “back to the time of George Washington.”\r\n\r\nThe “historic precedents,” as I have indicated earlier, did not\r\nstand up under close investigation. In an article for the Federal\r\nBar _Journal_ of January 1959, J. Russell Wiggins, executive editor\r\nof the Washington _Post and Times Herald_, told how the historic\r\nbackground—as President Eisenhower understood it—was first described.\r\nIt appeared in the Federal Bar _Journal_ on April 1949, in an article\r\nby Herman Wolkinson, a Justice Department lawyer. Wiggins pointed out\r\nthat an almost identical copy of the Wolkinson memorandum accompanied\r\nthe May 17, 1954, letter written by Eisenhower to Defense Secretary\r\nWilson. An expanded version of the same material was used by Attorney\r\nGeneral Rogers in testimony before Congress.\r\n\r\nWolkinson’s article had stated:\r\n\r\n“In the great conflicts which have arisen in the administrations\r\nof Washington, Jackson, Tyler, Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and\r\nHerbert Hoover, the Executive has always prevailed.”\r\n\r\nWiggins’ painstaking research had convinced him quite otherwise.\r\n“This contention is simply not supportable even on the basis of the\r\nhistorical episodes to which Mr. Wolkinson alludes and which the\r\nDepartment of Justice has incorporated in its memorandum.”\r\n\r\nGetting down to the specific episodes, Wiggins told how Congress,\r\nin March 1792, had passed a resolution to initiate an investigation\r\nof the disastrous expedition into Indian territory by Major General\r\nSt. Clair. The investigating committee had asked for all records and\r\npapers dealing with the expedition. President Washington did call\r\na cabinet meeting to discuss whether the papers should be given to\r\nCongress but finally concluded “to make all the papers available” to\r\nCongress. (See Chapter II.)\r\n\r\n“If this case is precedent for anything,” wrote Wiggins, “it is\r\na precedent to show that the first President was in favor of\r\ndisclosure, as a principle of government, and as a constitutional\r\nmatter, except in some possible instances which might later arise,\r\nbut which in this affair did not exist.”\r\n\r\nThere was one time when President Washington did refuse to send\r\npapers to the Hill. This was when the House of Representatives\r\nasked him for the instructions and papers furnished our ambassadors\r\nin negotiating the Jay treaty. “But,” said Wiggins, “this no more\r\nsustains the claim to sweeping powers of non-disclosure than the\r\nfirst episode. Here, President George Washington refused the papers\r\non the sound and specific constitutional ground that the Senate and\r\nnot the House was entrusted with authority to advise and consent on\r\nthe making of treaties.”\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing most of the so-called “withholding precedents” used\r\nby Wolkinson and President Eisenhower, Wiggins pointed out that\r\nPresident Jackson and President Tyler had bitterly opposed giving\r\npapers to Congress but in the end had forwarded all records requested.\r\n\r\nConcluded Wiggins: “In most of Mr. Wolkinson’s examples, the\r\nCongress prevailed, and got precisely what it sought to get.”\r\n\r\nBecause Senator Hennings and Congressmen Moss and Meader had pushed\r\nthrough the amendment to the Housekeeping Statute over Administration\r\nobjections, they realized that reliance upon “executive privilege”\r\ncould now become all the more stubborn and Congress would need to\r\ntake further action.\r\n\r\n“In the minds of most people in this country, governmental censorship\r\nprobably is associated most closely with war or dictatorship,”\r\nChairman Hennings said. “Official suppression of the truth generally\r\nis regarded as something alien to the American tradition of freedom\r\nand incompatible with our system of self-government. Yet, despite\r\nthese national attitudes, censorship and suppression of the truth are\r\nslowly becoming more and more commonplace in our federal government,\r\nand secrecy threatens to become the rule rather than the exception.”\r\n\r\nFrom the Republican side, the two Democrats were joined by\r\nCongressman Meader. “The net effect of the Attorney General’s\r\nstatement,” said Meader, “is that the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment will give to the Congress or its committees such\r\ninformation as the executive branch chooses to give and no more. I\r\nwonder if the American people and their elected representatives in\r\nCongress appreciate the significance of this ... pronouncement of the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government.”\r\n\r\nMeader declared that the Rogers doctrine “makes possible a rigged,\r\ndistorted, slanted” picture of what is going on in a Government\r\nagency.\r\n\r\n“The unlimited discretion in the executive branch of the Government\r\nover access to information in its possession asserted by the Attorney\r\nGeneral, would vest in the departments the power by ex parte\r\npresentations of half truths to build a record which would permit\r\nonly one conclusion.”\r\n\r\nIn an analysis that filled six pages in the _Congressional Record_,\r\nMeader pointed out that Rogers admitted there was “no judicial\r\nprecedent governing this question” of “executive privilege.” “More\r\nstudy, not less, is required for intelligent policy making in these\r\ndays,” he pleaded. “This asserts a doctrine of executive power which\r\nI believe is wholly out of keeping with our concept of democracy and\r\nself-government. It smacks of totalitarianism, and I hope it will\r\nnever prevail in this country.”\r\n\r\nBut the nonpartisan plea for reason and law made little impression.\r\nThe Eisenhower administration was smug in its popularity. Leaders of\r\nCongress were too busy with political chores to pay attention to any\r\nproblem not connected with the business of getting re-elected. The\r\npress could not or would not think logically or consistently on the\r\nsubject. Secrecy that stood in the way of an individual reporter or\r\nnewspaper was deplored by that reporter or newspaper, but by too few\r\nothers. For the most part the attack on secrecy lacked co-ordination,\r\nconsistency, and enlightened concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMuzzling the Public’s Watchdog\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Campbell had been treasurer and vice president of Columbia\r\nUniversity while General Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of that\r\ninstitution. A pleasant and friendly relationship developed between\r\nthe two men, and General Eisenhower was attracted by Campbell’s\r\ncompetency in accounting and finance. After General Eisenhower was\r\nelected President, he named Campbell a member of the Atomic Energy\r\nCommission in 1953.\r\n\r\nA year later President Eisenhower named Joseph Campbell Comptroller\r\nGeneral of the United States in charge of the General Accounting\r\nOffice (GAO). It is an important fifteen-year-term office designed to\r\nserve the Congress as the “financial watchdog” of all spending in the\r\nexecutive departments and agencies. No single office in the United\r\nStates is more vital to the task of forcing the sprawling federal\r\ngovernment to administer the laws fairly and make expenditures\r\naccording to the laws.\r\n\r\nThe GAO was established in the Budgeting and Accounting Act of\r\n1921 as an arm of the legislative branch of government. Once the\r\nComptroller General has been appointed by the President, he becomes\r\nan agent of the Congress. To assure the independence of the office,\r\nthe Congress established the long term and provided that the\r\nincumbent could be removed from office only by joint resolution of\r\nCongress or by impeachment.\r\n\r\nThe Budgeting and Accounting Act also gave the GAO the power to\r\nexamine all information and reports in order to determine whether\r\nmoney was being spent in a legal manner. The section on access to\r\nrecords states:\r\n\r\n“All departments and establishments shall furnish to the Comptroller\r\nGeneral such information regarding the powers, duties, activities,\r\norganization, financial transactions, and methods of business of\r\ntheir respective offices as he may from time to time require of\r\nthem; and the Comptroller General, or any of his assistants or\r\nemployees, when duly authorized by him, shall for the purpose of\r\nsecuring such information, have access to and the right to examine\r\nany books, documents, papers, or records of any such department or\r\nestablishment.”\r\n\r\nThe law allowed but one exception to the Comptroller General’s legal\r\nright to demand and obtain access to “records of any such department\r\nor establishment.” That one exception gave the Secretary of State\r\nthe power to determine whether there should be a publication of\r\nexpenditures of funds used in dealings or treaty making with foreign\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe law should have been clear to anyone. The GAO auditors were\r\nto be given access to all papers and all records dealing with\r\nthe expenditure of federal funds. It was the only way they could\r\ncarefully examine contracts and determine whether any frauds or\r\nillegal procedures were involved.\r\n\r\nBut through the years, as might be expected in a bureaucracy, some\r\nofficials had been reluctant to put all the cards on the table for\r\nthe GAO. The reluctance increased in proportion to the bungling,\r\nmismanagement, or fraud that might be uncovered by prying GAO\r\ninvestigators.\r\n\r\nIn the first years of Joseph Campbell’s tenure as Comptroller\r\nGeneral, his office faced some of the normal bureaucratic reluctance.\r\nBut, on the whole, the holding back was spotty. Usually the\r\ndepartments produced the records demanded when the inspection\r\nprovisions of the Budgeting and Accounting Act were pointed out to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBy 1958, however, the use of “executive privilege” had become so\r\nwidespread that it was interfering with the work of the GAO. The\r\ninterference gradually came to light through the work of an Armed\r\nServices subcommittee headed by Representative F. Edward Hebert, the\r\nLouisiana Democrat. Chairman Hebert had asked Comptroller General\r\nCampbell to do a thorough study of the multibillion-dollar Air Force\r\nballistic missile program. He had also set the GAO on the trail of\r\na dozen other smaller projects where it appeared that influence,\r\nfavoritism, incompetence, or fraud had cost the taxpayers millions of\r\ndollars in excess costs.\r\n\r\nTo Chairman Hebert this unjustified secrecy was serious business.\r\nFor nearly ten years he had been engaged in important investigations\r\nwhich had proved that the military services could not be relied upon\r\nto police their own spending. It was vital that there be an adequate\r\npolicing job on a Defense budget that totaled about 40 billion\r\ndollars a year—approximately half of the entire federal budget. Year\r\nafter year, Chairman Hebert and Chief Counsel John Courtney had\r\nconducted hearings showing incredible waste and inefficiency. The\r\nstaff of the Hebert subcommittee was small, and Chairman Hebert was\r\nforced to rely on the GAO for the major part of the auditing work and\r\nlegal studies.\r\n\r\nThe Defense Department could not avail itself of the claim of\r\n“national security” when the GAO auditors started an investigation\r\nbecause the GAO auditors were cleared to handle “Secret” and “Top\r\nSecret” classified material in the same manner that Defense officials\r\nwere. Lacking the “national security” claim, the military services\r\nlatched onto the claim of “executive privilege.” One directive\r\nfollowed another, gradually pulling down the secrecy curtain. The\r\nperiodic, quiet protests by Campbell went unnoticed by the public\r\nuntil the usually mild-mannered Comptroller General fired off a\r\nletter to Defense Secretary Neil McElroy.\r\n\r\n“These restrictions,” Campbell wrote, “could seriously hamper the\r\nGeneral Accounting office in performing its statutory responsibility\r\nand will impede the performance of our work.”\r\n\r\nHe pointed out to McElroy that his GAO auditors could not do their\r\njob in the face of directives that prohibited them from examining the\r\nInspector General reports, and allowed them only a summary of reports\r\nas approved by the Secretaries of the various armed services.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Chairman Hebert, Campbell made his complaint more\r\nspecific:\r\n\r\n“Any information or factual data directly bearing on a program of\r\nactivity subject to audit by the General Accounting Office should not\r\nbe withheld or subjected to procedures designed to screen official\r\ndocuments, papers, or records, by the authority or activity being\r\naudited.”\r\n\r\nLater, in a letter to the Moss subcommittee on Government\r\nInformation, the Comptroller General stated that he was seeking to\r\nmake a study of the activity of the Inspector General of the Air\r\nForce to determine how effective the internal investigations had been.\r\n\r\nHe stated that to conduct such an investigation, the GAO inspection\r\nmust include:\r\n\r\n  1 A survey of the Air Force procurement methods (advertising versus\r\n  negotiation).\r\n\r\n  2 A survey of procurement quantitative and qualitative program\r\n  changes.\r\n\r\n  3 A survey of contract cost overruns.\r\n\r\n“It is essential that such reports be made available to the General\r\nAccounting Office in order that we can evaluate the effectiveness\r\nof the department’s system of internal control and to preclude\r\nunwarranted and unnecessary duplication of effort in the internal\r\naudit and the independent reviews made by this office,” Campbell\r\nwrote.\r\n\r\n“There is no basis why reports on the subject of the types pointed\r\nout above should not be made available to the General Accounting\r\nOffice unless the purpose is to delay or hamper the efforts of the\r\noffice to disclose all facts bearing upon the activity or area under\r\naudit.\r\n\r\n“We believe that any departmental regulation denying to the General\r\nAccounting Office access to any report relating to ‘internal audit\r\nand control’ is contrary to the law.”\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that this was not a Democratic congressman\r\nor senator accusing a Republican administration. This was Joseph\r\nCampbell, long-time friend of President Eisenhower, charging that the\r\nEisenhower administration was acting “contrary to the law” in the\r\nclaim of an “executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nCongressman John Moss subsequently declared that President Eisenhower\r\nwas not discharging his duties under the Constitution. Under Article\r\nII, Section 3 of the Constitution, the President is obliged to “take\r\ncare that the laws be faithfully executed....” In this instance,\r\nPresident Eisenhower was not only disregarding the Budgeting and\r\nAccounting Act but also supporting those acting “contrary to the\r\nlaw,” Moss said.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fuss had started over GAO access to a sixty-two-page Air\r\nForce inspector general report on the ballistic missile program (see\r\nAppendix C), the real issue was whether the Air Force, the Army, the\r\nNavy, or any other executive agency could arbitrarily refuse to give\r\nreports, papers, and financial records to the GAO.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to follow President Eisenhower’s thinking. This\r\nwas a period of time when President Eisenhower and members of his\r\nadministration were emphasizing that financial problems could be\r\none of the nation’s big worries. One of the major problems, they\r\nbelieved, was making sure the government was getting its money’s\r\nworth from military spending.\r\n\r\nEven in times past, when GAO investigators were given maximum access\r\nto records, serious scandals had been unearthed. Most of them were\r\nnot discovered by the military establishment but came to light only\r\nafter the GAO or the congressional committees went to work. Chairman\r\nHebert and Campbell had a long record of fruitful hearings to back\r\nthem in questioning the wisdom (to say nothing of the legality) of\r\nallowing our military spenders to erect more barriers for the GAO\r\nauditors—the only independent outside check on the billions spent on\r\nmilitary matters.\r\n\r\nAt the presidential press conference on November 5, 1958, I raised\r\nthe question of the right of the General Accounting Office to examine\r\nreports of the Air Force and the Defense Department.\r\n\r\n“Mr. President,” I said, “you have mentioned the spending in the\r\nDefense Department here as one of the important issues, and the\r\nGeneral Accounting Office, which is the watchdog on frauds and\r\nextravagances in the various agencies, has been barred from reports\r\nover in the Air Force and the Defense Department generally, and on\r\nthis they [the Air Force and Defense Department officials] claim that\r\nthey have authority from you to withhold reports if it is ‘expedient\r\nto do so.’”\r\n\r\nI tried to make the question conform as much as possible to the\r\nprecise trouble area between the GAO and the Defense Department.\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” I continued, “if you have given that authority [to\r\nwithhold] and if you feel that the GAO should have a full rein to go\r\nin and investigate all indications of fraud and extravagance?”\r\n\r\nReplied the President: “You are obviously talking about some special\r\nthing that I would have to study before I could make—give an answer.\r\nI have stated this time and time again: I believe that every\r\ninvestigating committee of the Congress, every auditing office, like\r\nthe GAO, should always have the opportunity to see official records\r\nif the security of our country is not involved.”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower was now saying that the GAO should have all\r\nrecords unless the security of our country was involved. I tried to\r\npin him down on it.\r\n\r\n“Will they claim this, Mr. President, under ‘executive privilege—’” I\r\nstarted my question.\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower cut in before I had finished to avoid any\r\nfurther comment. “No, that’s all I have to say—I told you that is all\r\nI had to say for the moment.”\r\n\r\nRepresentative Clare Hoffman, the wily Michigan Republican, noted\r\nthat President Eisenhower’s answer seemed to bar use of “executive\r\nprivilege” in refusing reports to the GAO. A few days after the press\r\nconference, he wrote President Eisenhower to call attention to the\r\npress conference exchange and to ask:\r\n\r\n“Did you mean to imply by your comments that the complete text\r\nof Inspector General reports, including recommendations, be made\r\navailable to Congress and the General Accounting Office?”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower’s letter to Representative Hoffman on the\r\nsame day again barred the GAO from the full reports of inspectors\r\ngeneral. The President said that “facts” in the reports would be made\r\navailable to the GAO, but that “recommendations and other advisory\r\nmatter” were not to be released (see Appendix C).\r\n\r\nThe whole situation landed right back where it had started. The Air\r\nForce, Navy, or Army officials would still screen the Inspector\r\nGeneral reports, eliminate material they didn’t want to fall into the\r\nhands of GAO auditors, and pass out their own self-serving summary\r\nto the investigators. Law and logic had fallen by the wayside. The\r\nBudgeting and Accounting Act might as well not have been written\r\nfor all the good it was doing in forcing departments to produce all\r\npertinent documents.\r\n\r\nThe next big test came with the Navy. In February 1959, Comptroller\r\nGeneral Campbell wrote to the Moss subcommittee stating that\r\nthe secrecy curtain made it impossible for him to fulfill his\r\nresponsibility to audit Navy financial affairs.\r\n\r\n“We consider it illogical, impractical and contrary to express\r\nprovisions of the law for public officials to withhold, in their\r\ndiscretion, information concerning the discharge of their public\r\ntrust,” Campbell wrote.\r\n\r\n“We are advising the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy that we are unable to properly discharge our statutory\r\nresponsibility if information needed in our work is denied to our\r\nrepresentatives in the performance of our audits.”\r\n\r\nRepresentative William L. Dawson, chairman of the parent House\r\nGovernment Operation Committee, instructed Moss to prepare for public\r\nhearings. He wrote Campbell:\r\n\r\n“I am sure everything possible will be done to overcome the repeated\r\narrogance of Federal executive officials whose denial of information\r\nto the General Accounting Office flouts the clear law of the land.”\r\n\r\nComptroller General Campbell said that the “executive privilege”\r\nclaim was being made by the Secretary of the Navy on grounds that “he\r\nbelieves full disclosure of rank opinions, advice and recommendations\r\nfrom persons at lower levels ... would not be in the public interest.\r\n\r\n“This same reasoning is now being applied by the various bureaus and\r\noffices in the day-to-day work of their employees.\r\n\r\n“We believe that sound management practices require that\r\nobservations, opinions, and recommendations by subordinates and any\r\nother matters considered in making a decision should be a matter of\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n“All of these are matters upon which judgments are founded and\r\nsubsequent decision and actions are based. Such documentation serves\r\nas a protection to the individual making the decisions or taking the\r\naction as well as furnishing a sound basis for subsequent appraisal\r\nof their timeliness, effectiveness and honesty.”\r\n\r\nCampbell complained that under Navy procedure at that time “the\r\nindividuals having custody of the materials are required to screen\r\nthe material and remove from the official files any data they or\r\ntheir superiors feel we should not have.\r\n\r\n“These actions provide a means by which the Department could conceal\r\nsubstantive evidence of waste, extravagance, improvident management,\r\npoor procurement practices, or other adverse conditions.”\r\n\r\nBy March of 1959, Campbell had full proof that he could not rely\r\non the summary reports submitted to him by the Navy. He declared\r\nthat the Navy had submitted two reports on one subject that were\r\n“incorrect representations” of the government’s action. “The second\r\nversion of the report, while containing twice as many pages, is\r\nalso incomplete and inadequate because of the use of self-exercised\r\ncensorship.”\r\n\r\nCampbell said that the secrecy was not only illegal and bad\r\ngovernment but that it was mighty expensive. He explained that the\r\nsecrecy deprived the GAO auditors of information already accumulated\r\nat the taxpayers’ expense. This meant that the GAO was forced to go\r\nout and duplicate work already done if it was to make any effort to\r\nfulfill its responsibility.\r\n\r\nComptroller General Campbell put no price tag on the extra cost for\r\na GAO audit of the Navy. However, the GAO did estimate that lack of\r\naccess to the Air Force Inspector General reports made that audit\r\ncost at least $125,000 more than necessary. Though the cost of the\r\naudit could have been avoided with the proper co-operation of the Air\r\nForce, the audit ultimately disclosed millions of dollars in bungling\r\nand waste in the Air Force missile program—all covered up in the\r\nname of “executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nThe Richmond _Times-Dispatch_ commented:\r\n\r\n“The amazing thing about this situation is that President Eisenhower\r\nbacks the armed services in withholding vital information from\r\nthe GAO. He has been told by his legal advisers that ‘executive\r\nprivilege’ has some validity, where it is in essence nothing but the\r\ndetermination of bureaucrats to keep the GAO from seeing their books.\r\n\r\n“This bogus doctrine forced the GAO to spend an extra $125,000 in\r\nmaking its inquiry into Air Force mismanagement.... Just how much\r\nlonger is the public going to put up with this sort of thing?”\r\n\r\nI knew that Virginius Dabney, editor of the Richmond\r\n_Times-Dispatch_, was fed up with this expensive and undemocratic\r\nsecrecy. So was J. Russell Wiggins, executive editor of the\r\nWashington _Post and Times Herald_; James Pope, executive editor of\r\nthe Louisville _Courier-Journal_; Herbert Brucker, editor of the\r\nHartford _Courant_; V. M. (Red) Newton, managing editor of the Tampa\r\n_Tribune_; and Harold Cross, the special counsel for the American\r\nSociety of Newspaper Editors.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago _Daily News_, the St. Louis _Post-Dispatch_, and _The\r\nWall Street Journal_ were among the other top papers firmly opposed\r\nto the secrecy cover-up. But despite several excellent editorials,\r\nthe problem just wasn’t flamboyant enough to catch the attention\r\nof the public or even most reporters. Too many news stories and\r\neditorials in other papers merely repeated the self-serving\r\njustifications of the Eisenhower administration without determining\r\nwhether the assertions were true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nHiding the Laos Mess\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the summer of 1959, Representative Porter Hardy was fed up with\r\narbitrary executive secrecy. The lanky Virginia Democrat was getting\r\na double dose of “executive privilege” and had nearly reached the end\r\nof his patience. He was a member of the Armed Services subcommittee\r\nheaded by Chairman Edward Hebert, and therefore had firsthand\r\nknowledge of how the Defense Department was hampering investigations\r\nof military waste.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Hardy was also chairman of his own Foreign Operations\r\nand Monetary Affairs Subcommittee. This subcommittee (of the House\r\nGovernment Operations Committee) was responsible for investigating\r\nthe handling of more than 60 billion dollars in foreign aid by the\r\nState Department and the International Cooperation Administration\r\n(ICA).\r\n\r\nThe Hardy subcommittee had a small staff of a half dozen headed by\r\nJohn T. Reddan, the chief counsel. Under the best circumstances,\r\nHardy knew that they would be able to look into only a few reports\r\nof mismanagement or fraud. But a little scrutiny should soon tell\r\nwhether the internal investigations of ICA were being conducted in\r\nsuch a manner that the Congress could rely on ICA to police itself.\r\n\r\nTo find out how well ICA was performing, it was necessary to examine\r\nthe files of complaints of fraud or mismanagement and to determine\r\nhow these complaints were being followed up by ICA investigators.\r\nBut the ICA barred Hardy’s committee staff members from examining the\r\ninvestigation files as well as the evaluation reports ICA was making\r\non its own operations. Such files, Chairman Hardy was told, would\r\ncontain “advice, recommendations and conclusions,” and, according to\r\nPresident Eisenhower’s May 17, 1954, letter, therefore, could not be\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nThe investigation proceeded nonetheless. It was slow work, but with\r\npatience and persistence Chief Counsel Reddan, Counsel Richard\r\nBray, Jr., Counsel Miles Q. Romney, and Investigator Walton Woods\r\npieced together the information ICA had denied them. They got it by\r\ninterviewing former government employees, examining the files of\r\nbusiness firms with government contracts, and taking trips to other\r\nlands to personally examine foreign-aid spending.\r\n\r\nThe little country of Laos in southeast Asia was one of the first\r\non which they concentrated. The picture was not pretty. The\r\nadministration of U.S. aid was creating at least as many problems as\r\nit was trying to solve.\r\n\r\nThe aid program in Laos started in January 1955, when that nation\r\nwas granted its full independence. Laos had been a part of French\r\nIndochina with Cambodia and Vietnam. Independence for Laos had meant\r\nthat the United States took over the support of its entire military\r\nbudget—41 million dollars in 1955, 47 million dollars in 1956, 43\r\nmillion dollars in 1957, and 30 million dollars in 1958. Most of it\r\nwent to support a 25,000-man army. The subcommittee later concluded\r\nthat this military aid plus about 1.5 million dollars annually in\r\neconomic assistance added up to the fact that the United States was\r\n“virtually supporting the entire economy.”\r\n\r\nAs early as June 1957, the subcommittee received reports indicating\r\nthe foreign-aid program in Laos was being damaged by waste,\r\ninefficiency, and poor judgment. After preliminary inquiries, the\r\nformal investigation was started on April 10, 1958.\r\n\r\nThe requests for ICA files on Laos foreign-aid spending were rejected\r\nby ICA Director James W. Riddleberger. The ICA also barred Chairman\r\nHardy from files on India, Bolivia, Brazil, and Guatemala.\r\n\r\nA few months later, the ICA refused to let the GAO auditors see the\r\nfiles on Laos.\r\n\r\nChairman Hardy was irked with the frustration, but downright furious\r\nat what he considered to be a disregard of the law. Certainly the\r\nICA reports on Laos should be made available to the GAO, for the\r\nBudgeting and Accounting Act of 1921 provided explicitly that all\r\nrecords of all departments must be made available to the GAO auditors.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when the foreign-aid program had been established in\r\n1948, the debates had included discussion of the accounting on\r\nforeign aid and the necessity for availability of information to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nAt that time Senator Arthur Vandenberg, the Michigan Republican,\r\ncommented:\r\n\r\n“There are several points in the bill where it is provided that\r\nCongress is to be advised. In addition, we are creating ... the\r\n‘watchdog’ committee [Joint Committee on Economic Cooperation] ...\r\nwhich will be entitled to all information of every character at all\r\ntimes.”\r\n\r\nDespite the law and the intention of the lawmakers, the ICA had\r\nclamped the secrecy lid on, and kept it on. ICA also rejected GAO\r\nrequests for information on foreign-aid spending in Formosa, India,\r\nVietnam, Pakistan, France, Turkey, and others.\r\n\r\nIn its investigation of but one of the foreign-aid programs—the\r\none in Laos—the Hardy subcommittee unearthed enough evidence of\r\nincompetence, laxity, mismanagement, and fraud to fill scores of\r\npages of an official report.\r\n\r\nThe military program for a 25,000-man Laotian army, for example,\r\narose from a political decision made by the State Department and\r\ncontrary to the recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the\r\nDefense Department. “Significant military opinion has suggested a\r\nforce of 12,000 to 15,000,” the Hardy subcommittee reported.\r\n\r\nThe subcommittee also found favoritism, conflict of interest,\r\nand bribery in connection with ICA contracts in Laos. “Edward T.\r\nMcNamara, [ICA] public works and industry officer, accepted bribes\r\ntotaling at least $13,000 from Willis H. Bird and Gerald A. Peabody\r\nof the Universal Construction Co., in return for helping them\r\nsecure lucrative contracts and overlooking deficiencies in their\r\nperformance.”\r\n\r\nThe subcommittee reported dozens of incidents of minor officials’\r\nshowing favoritism toward firms that later employed them. One sharp\r\ncharge was aimed at the man who headed the United States Operations\r\nMission (USOM) during part of this period.\r\n\r\n“Carter dePaul, former USOM director, sold his 1947 Cadillac upon\r\nhis departure from Laos to Gerald A. Peabody, head of Universal, at\r\nan inflated price [about $3000]. Uncontroverted evidence indicates\r\nthe vehicle was at that time inoperable, and that shortly thereafter\r\nit was cut up and the pieces dropped down an abandoned well. In the\r\ninterim, it had stood rusting in front of Universal’s main office,\r\nwhere it was the subject of scornful amusement by Laotians and\r\nAmericans alike.”\r\n\r\nMore shocking than the frauds was the evidence dug up by the\r\nsubcommittee showing that U. S. Embassy officials in Laos and high\r\nICA officials in Washington took no effective remedial action after\r\nreceiving reports of corruption and mismanagement. Greater energy was\r\nobviously being expended in hiding the mess from Chairman Hardy and\r\nhis investigators.\r\n\r\nThe subcommittee’s evidence indicated that an investigator for the\r\nICA Auditor Haynes Miller, “was ‘railroaded’ out of Laos because\r\nhe was close to discovering the truth about Universal, its bribes,\r\nits virtual monopoly of U.S. aid construction projects ... and its\r\nwoefully inadequate performance.”\r\n\r\nThis action to remove Auditor Miller seemed more reprehensible to\r\nme than any ordinary theft or misuse of money or government power.\r\nThis was evidence that there was a brutal conspiracy within the U.\r\nS. Embassy in Laos to eliminate those officials who were complaining\r\nof fraud and mismanagement and to shield persons who were engaged\r\nin wrongdoing. It demonstrated what could happen when government\r\nofficials feel they have an “executive privilege” to hide the records\r\non their activities.\r\n\r\nMiller’s reports and his persistent efforts to get something done\r\nabout deficiencies in the program only resulted in his removal. He\r\nwas “unable to adjust” to Laos, some of his superiors and associates\r\nsaid. U. S. Ambassador J. Graham Parsons sent a telegram to\r\nWashington stating he had invited the investigator to resign “because\r\nof obvious signs of nervous disorder.”\r\n\r\n“Ambassador Parsons’ opinion of Miller’s ‘nervous disorder’ was\r\nrendered without benefit of medical advice,” the Hardy subcommittee\r\nreported. “This is contrary to Department of State regulations.\r\nCompetent medical advice was available to the Ambassador and could\r\nhave been solicited.”\r\n\r\n“One month later, on October 30, 1957,” the report added, “Miller was\r\nsubjected to a full medical examination in Washington and certified\r\nas ‘qualified for general duty.’”\r\n\r\nOfficials of the ICA excused the deficiencies and maladministration\r\nin the Laos program with the claim that the aid program, no matter\r\nhow poorly administered, had saved Laos from Communism.\r\n\r\n“This assertion is purely speculative, and can be neither proved nor\r\ndisproved,” the Hardy subcommittee stated in 1959. That was two years\r\nbefore it was generally realized that a corrupt aid program had\r\nprobably helped the Communists in Laos.\r\n\r\nEven in 1959 the Hardy subcommittee concluded “that a lesser sum\r\nof money more efficiently administered would have been far more\r\neffective in achieving economic and political stability in Laos, and\r\nin increasing its capacity to reject Communist military aggression or\r\npolitical subversion.”\r\n\r\nAt a press conference on July 2, 1959, two weeks after the Laos\r\nreport was issued, William McGaffin, of the Chicago _Daily News_, put\r\nthe problem of secrecy in ICA to President Eisenhower.\r\n\r\n“Mr. President,” McGaffin started, “do you see any solution to the\r\nquarrel between Congress and the executive branch of the Government\r\nover the question of freedom of information?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know exactly what you are adverting to when you say\r\nfreedom of information,” President Eisenhower said and then jumped\r\nfor the safety of George Washington’s shadow:\r\n\r\n“This question, from the time of Washington, has been a live one.\r\nWhen the Executive determines that something is to the—will damage\r\nthe security of the United States or its vital interest, then it\r\nwithholds information that possibly could be put out. But I don’t\r\nknow of any specific thing which you are talking about at this\r\nmoment.”\r\n\r\nMcGaffin bounced back:\r\n\r\n“Mr. President, if I could just spell it out briefly: Congress seems\r\nperturbed over various instances where they feel that the executive\r\nbranch has misused the claim of ‘executive privileges’ and denied\r\nthem information which they should have.\r\n\r\n“For instance,” McGaffin continued: “There are evaluation reports\r\nmade by the ICA on certain countries which have received mutual\r\nsecurity—Formosa, Laos, Brazil, Guatemala—a whole string of them, and\r\nCongress has raised the point where they are going to try to pass a\r\nlaw which would compel ICA to turn that information over to them.”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower confused the problem with national security in\r\nanswering:\r\n\r\n“Well, there are certain things, particularly in the security field,\r\nthat, if you reveal, are very obviously damaging to the United States\r\nand I think anyone of good sense will see that. And you simply must\r\ntake measures to see that those things are not revealed.\r\n\r\n“And, now, this has been—there is nothing new about this. The\r\nExecutive, and there seems to be a sort of congenital built-in mutual\r\nopposition that I don’t know why it occurs, I don’t particularly feel\r\nit personally, but I know it’s there and at times it comes to my\r\nattention in one form or another.\r\n\r\n“But,” said the President, retreating to the safety of his reputation\r\nas an honest man, “I am using my own conscience on the matter and\r\nwhen such things as these come to me for decision, I shall continue\r\nto do so.”\r\n\r\nIt was a most unsatisfactory answer on a most important question\r\ninvolving the policing of spending by the Defense Department and the\r\nICA. I decided to follow up where the Hardy subcommittee and Bill\r\nMcGaffin left off. At the next press conference, on July 15, 1959, I\r\ncaught President Eisenhower’s eye.\r\n\r\n“Mr. President,” I started. “Several committees of Congress have\r\ncharged that departments of your administration have used the\r\nsecrecy of the so-called ‘executive privilege’ to hide imprudence,\r\nmismanagement, fraud, and in some cases material which has later\r\nresulted in indictments. I wonder if you have taken any steps to\r\ncorrect this?”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower’s eyes blazed with anger. Despite his emotion he\r\nremained controlled enough to avoid the kind of comments on facts or\r\nlaw that had put him in so much trouble in the past. He said:\r\n\r\n“I think you had better put that question in written form and let me\r\ntake a look at it because you start off, right off the bat, with the\r\npremise or implication that someone is guilty of fraud and I don’t\r\nbelieve it.”\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to reply that the charges of fraud and mismanagement\r\nwere included in official reports of Congress, he cut me off sharply.\r\n“I will see your letter if you would like to submit it.”\r\n\r\nIn the letter to President Eisenhower, I tried to be careful and to\r\nbe respectful of his position:\r\n\r\n  My dear Mr. President: In response to your request, I am submitting\r\n  the basic question which I asked at the July 15, 1959, press\r\n  conference. I regret that the statement of the question at the\r\n  press conference raised any implication of fraud, or knowledge\r\n  of fraud, at the White House level. Such an implication was not\r\n  intended. The question was based on the findings of various\r\n  committees of the Congress. In general the reports dealt with\r\n  subordinate officials who, it is contended, used the so-called\r\n  executive privilege in an effort to conceal their activities from\r\n  investigators of Congress and the General Accounting Office.\r\n\r\n  Several committees of Congress have made reports charging that\r\n  officials in some departments of Government have used the\r\n  secrecy of executive privilege to hide what the committees\r\n  called carelessness, mismanagement, fraud, and other alleged\r\n  improprieties. Comptroller General Joseph Campbell has told the\r\n  Congress that some executive departments have violated the law—the\r\n  Budgeting and Accounting Act—in withholding reports from him\r\n  in connection with waste, mismanagement and improprieties. Mr.\r\n  Campbell has testified before the House Appropriations Committee\r\n  that this secrecy is a violation of the law, and he also stated\r\n  that it “could be almost fatal” to vital auditing functions his\r\n  office performs.\r\n\r\n  Comptroller General Campbell and the Moss subcommittee, among\r\n  others, have raised the question as to whether this withholding of\r\n  information is inconsistent with the Constitutional requirements\r\n  that the Chief Executive “take care that the laws be faithfully\r\n  executed.”\r\n\r\n  There is no problem of national security involved. The Air Force\r\n  and Navy have informed Congress and the GAO that no national\r\n  security is involved, since the GAO auditors have the same\r\n  clearance to examine classified material as do the officials in the\r\n  departments.\r\n\r\n  Against this background, I would rephrase my question as follows:\r\n  In the light of the provisions of the Budgeting and Accounting Act,\r\n  do you feel you have an executive responsibility to carry out the\r\n  law in line with the Comptroller General’s views?\r\n\r\nThe answer, from Gerald D. Morgan, Deputy Assistant to the President,\r\nreached me a few days later on July 21. Morgan merely quoted from the\r\nPresident’s letter to Representative Hoffman of some months before,\r\nand from other earlier statements of his on “executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nMorgan wrote, “The President’s position has not changed.” I was not\r\nconvinced that President Eisenhower knew what his position was. The\r\nletter left all basic questions unanswered.\r\n\r\nThe foreign-aid bill, amending the Mutual Security Act of 1954,\r\nwas now before the Congress, and Representative Hardy had tacked\r\non an amendment specifically stating that “all documents, papers,\r\ncommunications, audits, reviews, findings, recommendation reports and\r\nother material which relate to the operation or activities of the\r\nInternational Cooperation Administration shall be furnished to the\r\nGeneral Accounting Office” and authorized committees of Congress.\r\n\r\nOn July 24, 1959, President Eisenhower signed the bill with Hardy’s\r\namendment, including three provisions for disclosure of information\r\nto the Congress or the GAO. In signing it, however, the President\r\nserved notice he would not abide by the disclosure sections:\r\n\r\n“I have signed this bill on the express premise that the three\r\namendments relating to disclosure are not intended to alter and\r\ncannot alter the recognized constitutional duty and power of the\r\nexecutive with respect to the disclosure of information, documents,\r\nand other materials. Indeed, any other construction of these\r\namendments would raise grave constitutional question under the\r\nhistoric separation of powers doctrine.”\r\n\r\nFive days later at the July 29, 1959, press conference I asked the\r\nPresident if he considered the provisions in the bill to cut off\r\nfunds to balky agencies to be “a criticism of the administration’s\r\nsecrecy policies.”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower turned red in the face at the reference\r\nto “secrecy” in his administration. “You start your question\r\nwith an implied fact that is not a fact,” he said. “You say\r\nthe administration’s secrecy policies. There has been no\r\nadministration....”\r\n\r\nI tried to amplify my question, but was cut off.\r\n\r\n“Please sit down,” the President said sharply. I sat on orders from\r\nthe Commander in Chief, and he continued:\r\n\r\n“There has been no administration since my memory, and I have been\r\nin this city since 1926, who has gone to such lengths to make\r\ninformation available as long as the national security and the\r\nnational interest of this country is not involved.”\r\n\r\nIt was fruitless for me to try to stand up and tell him what was\r\nhappening in his administration. So I sat still and took it. The\r\nsupport that came later from editors over the country was most\r\ngratifying.\r\n\r\nV. M. (Red) Newton, Jr., managing editor of the Tampa _Tribune_,\r\nwrote to President Eisenhower:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Mollenhoff’s question at the press conference about your\r\nadministration’s ‘secrecy policies’ had to do with the House of\r\nRepresentatives provisions in the foreign aid bill that would force\r\nthe bureaucracy to give information of this foreign aid to the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n“Both the Congress, which votes the expenditure, and the American\r\npeople, who pay the tax funds, are entitled to full information.”\r\n\r\nThe Richmond _Times-Dispatch_ in an editorial entitled “Does\r\nEisenhower Understand?” commented: “Somebody is going to have to\r\nexplain to President Eisenhower that the ‘executive privilege’ dogma,\r\nwhich originated in his first term five years ago, is being perverted\r\ninto a device for ‘covering up’ and denying the public the facts\r\nconcerning the government.”\r\n\r\nThe editorial commented on the “corruption, profiteering and\r\nmismanagement in Laos” in the ICA, and the fact that the Teapot Dome\r\nscandals would never have been uncovered if such a principle as\r\n“executive privilege” had been invoked.\r\n\r\n“So it would be advisable for Mr. Eisenhower to look into this\r\n‘executive privilege’ thing much more carefully than he has done so\r\nfar. He will find that it carries within itself the seeds of scandal,\r\nand offers needless temptation to department heads. It should be\r\nabolished.”\r\n\r\n_The Wall Street Journal_ editorialized on the “Misplaced Anger” of\r\nPresident Eisenhower. It gave President Eisenhower full credit as\r\na “man who believes that public office is a public trust.” But the\r\n_Journal_ in its usual fair but solid way called attention to the\r\nentire problem of the GAO’s obtaining access to government records so\r\nit could fulfill its responsibility.\r\n\r\n“If he [the President] were to inquire into the extent of secrecy,”\r\nsaid _The Wall Street Journal_, “we have an idea the President would\r\nbe far more angered at some of his own bureaucrats than at the\r\nreporter who brought the secrecy to his attention.”\r\n\r\nThe Hartford _Courant_, edited by Herbert Brucker, carried an\r\nequally fine editorial. Brucker was chairman of the Freedom of\r\nInformation Committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors,\r\nand was one of a handful of the editors who knew the subject\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\nBy this time editors of a couple dozen newspapers had done\r\nconsiderable study on the problem of “executive privilege.” Although\r\ncognizant of the many problems weighing on President Eisenhower, they\r\nfelt the time had come for him to make himself aware of the insidious\r\nsecrecy that was creeping into the federal government under his\r\nprestige.\r\n\r\nIt was a week after this press conference that James W. Riddleberger,\r\nDirector of the ICA, refused to make evaluation reports available to\r\nCongress on the foreign-aid program in Laos and Vietnam.\r\n\r\nNow Chairman Hardy saw that a disclosure amendment to the\r\nMutual Security law would not be enough to force the Eisenhower\r\nadministration to produce records for the GAO and the Congress.\r\nThe 3.1-billion-dollar foreign-aid appropriations bill was still\r\npending in Congress, and Hardy decided to try to use an amendment to\r\nthis purse-string measure to force the Eisenhower administration to\r\nproduce records.\r\n\r\nThe House was unanimous in adopting the Hardy amendment to the\r\nappropriations bill. This amendment provided that the Comptroller\r\nGeneral could shut off aid funds to any program if records were\r\nrefused to Congress and GAO investigators.\r\n\r\nThe Eisenhower administration was gravely concerned over this\r\namendment. Riddleberger voiced the opposition, and the Senate\r\nweakened in the face of administration pressure. The Senate version\r\nof the appropriations bill carried the provision that the President\r\ncould authorize withholding by a simple certification “that he has\r\nforbidden its being furnished ... and his reason for so doing.” In\r\na late night session the Senate-House conference committee accepted\r\nthe huge loophole in the Senate version of the appropriations bill.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Hardy recognized it immediately as a loophole that\r\ncould destroy the effectiveness of his amendment. A simple note from\r\nthe President would override any request by Congress or the GAO.\r\n\r\nWould President Eisenhower read the documents necessary to determine\r\nfor himself whether a certification for withholding was justified? It\r\nseemed more likely to his critics that he would sign certifications\r\ncontinuing to bar the GAO and Congress from a thorough examination\r\nof the internal workings of the foreign-aid program. Chairman\r\nHardy’s fears were justified. It wasn’t long before his requests\r\nfor information were being met with “certification” from President\r\nEisenhower giving only the most general reasons.\r\n\r\nThe Congress could have done more than it did. It unquestionably had\r\nthe necessary power, reaffirmed by the Supreme Court as recently as\r\n1957 in the Watkins case. The Court said:\r\n\r\n“The power of Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the\r\nlegislative process. That power is broad. It encompasses inquiries\r\nconcerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed\r\nor possibly needed statutes. It includes surveys of defects in our\r\nsocial, economic, or political system for the purpose of enabling the\r\nCongress to remedy them. It comprehends probes into departments of\r\nthe Federal Government to expose corruption, inefficiency and waste.”\r\n\r\nI was unsuccessful in my efforts to get Speaker Sam Rayburn or\r\nMajority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson interested in taking any effective\r\nmeasures to reaffirm the right of Congress to compel production of\r\nrecords for GAO.\r\n\r\nCongress did deliver the Eisenhower administration one blow in 1959\r\nin connection with the “executive privilege” issue. That was when\r\nPresident Eisenhower nominated Admiral Lewis Strauss to be Secretary\r\nof Commerce. The hearings before the Interstate and Foreign Commerce\r\nCommittee started on March 17, and pulled out past the middle of May.\r\nAlthough a good many personality clashes were involved, the role that\r\nStrauss had played in the Dixon-Yates contract and his advocacy of\r\nextreme “executive privilege” also figured.\r\n\r\nThe report favoring the Strauss confirmation stated: “Our committee\r\nspent much time in detail examination of specific instances in which\r\nit is charged that the nominee withheld or was grudging in giving\r\ninformation to congressional committees. The few instances charged\r\nrepresent a minute percentage of the nominee’s dealings with the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n“In fact, the nominee showed great diligence in keeping the Congress\r\ninformed,” concluded the six Republicans and two Democrats who signed\r\nthe majority report.\r\n\r\nWhen questioned about the Dixon-Yates contract, Strauss had said: “I\r\nthought it was a good contract and I still do ... it would have cost\r\nthe people a great deal less than the plant ... is now going to cost.”\r\n\r\nStrauss denied that he had used “executive privilege” to hold out\r\ninformation from Congress in the Dixon-Yates controversy.\r\n\r\n“No information was withheld by me,” he said. “No question failed of\r\nanswer except one which was several times repeated and to which I\r\nrespectfully declined response on ground that to demand conversations\r\nhad with the President or members of his personal staff would be in\r\nviolation of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers ...\r\nI testified that the contract with Mississippi Valley Generating\r\nCompany had been entered into at the direction of the President and\r\nhad been terminated at the direction of the President, and that, I\r\nsubmit, should have been sufficient.”\r\n\r\nStrauss claimed a total right under “executive privilege” to refuse\r\nrecords to Congress, and the seven-member Democratic minority\r\nconcluded:\r\n\r\n“The record ... indicates such withholding is without basis in law,\r\nand that the nominee had no concern for the law in this respect.\r\nFrom the record it is clear that the nominee time after time has\r\nresisted furnishing the appropriate committees of the Congress with\r\ninformation needed in order for Congress to properly perform its\r\nlegislative functions.\r\n\r\n“It appears to us from careful attention to the testimony, that Mr.\r\nStrauss had withheld or manipulated information to serve policy or\r\npersonal ends. On the basis of the record, we have grave doubts as to\r\nwhether or not information furnished by Mr. Strauss, as Secretary of\r\nCommerce, would be accurate or complete.”\r\n\r\nThe minority position was to prevail on the Senate floor where the\r\nStrauss nomination was defeated.\r\n\r\nSenator Mike Monroney, the Oklahoma Democrat, explained his\r\nopposition to the Strauss nomination thus:\r\n\r\n“Both the people and the press are entitled to expect from the\r\nlegislative branch of Government the vigilant protection of the\r\npeople’s right to know. For the Senate to seek to give protection in\r\nthe exercise of its power of confirmation is not only proper, it is\r\nobligatory.\r\n\r\n“I conceive it to be basic to democratic government that the people\r\nand their elected representatives in the Congress, are entitled\r\nto receive from the officials of the executive branch, not merely\r\nliteral truth, but full information, freely given without design to\r\nsoothe, to confuse or divert.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Strauss nomination was defeated in mid-June, I had hopes\r\nthat the Congress was on the way to recognizing the problem of\r\n“executive privilege” for all that it was. But by the end of the year\r\nit was apparent that most of the members of Congress had gone back to\r\ntheir little personal problems and had left Moss, Hennings, Hardy,\r\nand a few others to wrestle with the big problem of how to obtain an\r\nadequate GAO audit of spending that involved more than half the total\r\nnational budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDefiance to the End, Above the Law\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the investigation of the aid program in Laos, Representative\r\nPorter Hardy and his subcommittee staff moved on to the aid programs\r\nin Latin America. The subcommittee had examined some Latin-American\r\naid programs as early as 1955 and unearthed several deficiencies. But\r\nthe Eisenhower administration had claimed that the shortcomings were\r\ndue largely to the newness of the programs and suggested that the\r\nsubcommittee examine them again five years later.\r\n\r\nThe five years had now elapsed, and on April 28, 1960, Chairman\r\nHardy notified Secretary of State Christian Herter and ICA Director\r\nRiddleberger that he was initiating an investigation of the aid\r\nprograms to Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, and\r\nColombia.\r\n\r\nSeveral new laws were on the books to facilitate the investigation.\r\nThe 1959 law establishing the office of Inspector General and\r\nComptroller (OIGC) in the State Department provided that:\r\n\r\n“All documents, papers, communications, audits, reviews, findings,\r\nrecommendations, reports, and other material which relate to the\r\noperation or activities of the Office of Inspector General and\r\nComptroller shall be furnished the General Accounting Office and to\r\nany committee of the Congress, or any duly authorized subcommittee\r\nthereof.”\r\n\r\nThe Congress in 1960 amended the Mutual Security Act providing the\r\nGAO could shut off funds to the OIGC if that agency did not furnish\r\nrecords requested in a reasonable time.\r\n\r\nChairman Hardy’s staff had also called his attention to another\r\nlaw (5 U.S.C. 105 [a]) which provided that every department shall,\r\nupon request of the Government Operations Committee, “furnish any\r\ninformation requested of it relating to any matters within the\r\njurisdiction of said committee.”\r\n\r\nAdded to these laws, and the previously mentioned Budgeting and\r\nAccounting Act of 1921, was the fact that the State Department was\r\npreparing to ask Congress for more money for aid to Latin America.\r\nThe stage was legally and psychologically well set for co-operation.\r\nAnd Chairman Hardy was indeed advised that he would receive full\r\nco-operation. It never came. When his first requests for files on the\r\nBolivia program produced no results in six weeks, Hardy notified the\r\nState Department and ICA that hearings would begin on the information\r\npolicy on June 28, 1960.\r\n\r\nThe hearings revealed that the State Department had constructed an\r\ninvolved thirteen-step routine for clearing papers for Congress,\r\nand the papers Hardy requested simply had not been cleared. Eric H.\r\nHager, legal adviser of the Department of State, identified himself\r\nas the man responsible for the new system.\r\n\r\nIt was found that in one instance it took six weeks for one\r\nsubcommittee request to clear eight of the thirteen steps. When\r\nChairman Hardy tried to find out what had happened to the request for\r\ndocuments, he learned that the request and the documents were resting\r\nin the “in box” in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of State\r\nfor Congressional Relations. The papers had been gathering dust in\r\nthe box for two weeks and were only moved when the State Department\r\nstarted to prepare for the hearing.\r\n\r\nIn the report on the hearings, Hardy’s subcommittee explained the\r\nneed for original documents as “the best evidence available” on the\r\ninternal operations of ICA.\r\n\r\n“It has been the policy and practice of the subcommittee, in order to\r\ninsure accurate reporting of these complex operations, to support its\r\nfindings with documentary corroboration from files of the executive\r\nagencies,” the report stated.\r\n\r\n“The subcommittee has sought to obtain the facts from the documents\r\nand records ... as they are prepared in the ordinary course of doing\r\nbusiness, rather than to rely upon oral testimony or upon secondary\r\ndocuments prepared especially for the subcommittee’s consideration.”\r\n\r\nThe report scored “executive privilege” as a “nebulous doctrine”\r\nthat had plagued the subcommittee with delays. Again it was pointed\r\nout that the withholding of information was in violation of clear\r\nlaws imposing a duty to make records available to Congress. The\r\nreport stated that the subcommittee had sought to be reasonable in\r\nits request, and “on several occasions [has] withdrawn its requests\r\nfor particular documents at the suggestion of the executive branch.\r\nExamples of documents in this category are certain memoranda\r\nrecording high-level discussions between Department of State\r\nofficials and senior officials of foreign governments.”\r\n\r\nThe report stated it should be understood that this willingness to\r\nrefrain from pressing for certain documents was not a recognition of\r\nany right to withhold them. It continued:\r\n\r\n“No court decision has settled the question of whether executive\r\nofficials may refuse to honor a request of a congressional committee\r\nfor papers, documents and records. Many court decisions, however,\r\nhave upheld the power of congressional committees to obtain records\r\nand papers in the possession of private individuals, corporations,\r\nand associations even though such records might be regarded as of\r\na highly personal nature. It logically follows that the power of\r\nCongress to obtain information regarding the public business, the\r\nexercise of authority granted by Congress, or the expenditure of\r\nfunds appropriated by Congress would likewise be upheld in the event\r\nof a court test.\r\n\r\n“If Congress is to discharge its constitutional legislative and\r\npolicymaking functions, it must have reliable information about the\r\npublic business.”\r\n\r\nTo allow the executive branch to pick and choose what the Congress\r\nwould be allowed to examine “can, and frequently does, result in\r\ngiving Congress a distorted picture,” the report said.\r\n\r\nThen it suggested the use of two existing powers of Congress to\r\noppose this abuse of power by the executive: the power of subpoena,\r\nand the power of the purse.\r\n\r\n“The power of subpoena, however, should be used only as a last\r\nresort. Utilizing the power of the purse, the Congress can and\r\nshould provide, in authorizing and appropriating legislation, that\r\nthe continued availability of appropriated funds is contingent upon\r\nthe furnishing of complete and accurate information relating to the\r\nexpenditure of such funds to the General Accounting Office and to the\r\nappropriate committees of Congress at their request.”\r\n\r\nA week after the report was issued, Chairman Hardy sent a letter to\r\nthe ICA, State Department, and the Development Loan Fund asking for\r\nall documents on programs for seven Latin-American countries. His\r\nstaff had already obtained considerable information from sources\r\noutside ICA indicating mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and\r\nother corruption in the program in Peru.\r\n\r\nA month later, on October 11, 1960, President Eisenhower issued a\r\nformal order denying access to the records Hardy had requested.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later, on October 31, 1960, Chairman Hardy made a formal\r\nrequest for specific ICA documents from the Office of Inspector\r\nGeneral and Comptroller. This set the groundwork for shutting off\r\nfunds to the Office of Inspector General and Comptroller under the\r\nprovisions of the 1960 Amendment to the Mutual Security Act cited\r\nearlier in this chapter.\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower followed up a month later, on December 2, with a\r\ncertification denying access to these OIGC documents and eighty other\r\ndocuments requested.\r\n\r\nHere was the showdown to determine how far President Eisenhower would\r\ngo in overriding the express provisions of the 1959 law establishing\r\nthe Office of Inspector General and Comptroller. Chairman Hardy\r\nnotified the GAO of the OIGC refusal to produce records. And\r\nComptroller General Joseph Campbell, as head of GAO, filed notice\r\nthat unless the documents were made available the funds for OIGC\r\nwould be shut off on December 9.\r\n\r\nBy so doing, Campbell ruled that the refusal to produce the documents\r\non foreign aid to Latin-American countries was a violation of the\r\nlaw even if the orders were issued by his one-time close associate,\r\nPresident Eisenhower.\r\n\r\nOn December 9, Gerald Morgan, Deputy Assistant to the President,\r\nrequested a ruling from Attorney General William P. Rogers, and\r\nthirteen days later Rogers wrote President Eisenhower (see Appendix\r\nC). The Attorney General, as would be expected from his earlier\r\nespousal of the most extreme interpretation of “executive privilege,”\r\ndeclared Comptroller General Campbell’s ruling “erroneous.” In\r\nhis opinion, the President had a constitutional right to withhold\r\nwhatever he wanted to withhold. Rogers advised President Eisenhower\r\nthat he had the authority to direct the Secretary of the Treasury and\r\nthe Secretary of State to disregard the ruling of the Comptroller\r\nGeneral cutting off funds for the Office of Inspector General and\r\nComptroller.\r\n\r\nWith this advice in hand, President Eisenhower, on December 23,\r\noverrode the disclosure provisions of the Mutual Security Act of\r\n1959 and the ruling of the Comptroller General he had appointed. In\r\nletters to Secretary of Treasury Robert B. Anderson and to Secretary\r\nof State Christian Herter, President Eisenhower told them to use\r\nfederal funds to pay the Office of Inspector General and Comptroller.\r\n\r\nHe called attention to Campbell’s contention that such payments were\r\nto be cut off under the law passed in 1959, and added:\r\n\r\n“This position, I am advised by the Attorney General, is based upon\r\nerroneous interpretation of law which would reach an unconstitutional\r\nresult and that mutual security program funds continue to be made\r\navailable for expenses of the Office of Inspector General and\r\nComptroller.”\r\n\r\n“Accordingly, you are hereby directed, until the end of my term of\r\noffice on January 20, 1961, to cause disbursements to be made for\r\nsuch expenses upon the receipt of certified vouchers presented for\r\nthat purpose.”\r\n\r\nChairman Hardy continued the investigation of Peru. But he had need\r\nfor documents that would be crucial in establishing the degree\r\nof mismanagement and corruption in the ICA program there. The\r\nmost he could do now was to hope for better success under the new\r\nadministration. However, he did not want to present President-elect\r\nJohn F. Kennedy with a problem for solution on or before the January\r\n20 inaugural ceremonies.\r\n\r\nHe talked to Theodore Sorenson, Administrative Assistant to Senator\r\nKennedy and later counsel to the President, and informed him of the\r\npending problem. Hardy stated that he would withdraw his request\r\nwhich could prevent payment of OIGC personnel if he received\r\nassurances from the President-elect that the new administration would\r\nreview the problem immediately after the inaugural.\r\n\r\nOn December 31, 1960, Hardy received a telegram from President-elect\r\nKennedy asking that he postpone action on the documents until the new\r\nadministration had “an opportunity to review [the] situation.” Hardy\r\ncomplied.\r\n\r\nThe night of January 18, 1961, President Eisenhower went before a\r\nnationwide audience to give his “farewell address.” He appealed\r\nfor an “alert and knowledgeable citizenry” to combat the\r\nmilitary-industrial complex that could “endanger our liberties or\r\ndemocratic processes.”\r\n\r\n“This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a\r\nlarge arms industry is new in the American experience,” President\r\nEisenhower said. “The total influence—economic, political, even\r\nspiritual—is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n“We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must\r\nnot fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources,\r\nand livelihood are all involved: so is the very structure of our\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n“In the council of Government, we must guard against the acquisition\r\nof unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the\r\nmilitary-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of\r\nmisplaced power exists and will persist.”\r\n\r\n[Congressman Edward Hebert, of Louisiana, had made a good many\r\ncomments on the military-industrial complex, and he had conducted a\r\nfine investigation documenting some of the problems. But the record\r\nindicated Chairman Hebert had not received full co-operation from the\r\nEisenhower administration. Now President Eisenhower was expressing as\r\nmuch concern as Hebert.]\r\n\r\n“We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our\r\nliberties or democratic processes,” President Eisenhower warned. “We\r\nshould take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable\r\ncitizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and\r\nmilitary machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so\r\nthat security and liberty may prosper together.\r\n\r\n“Partly because of the huge costs involved, a Government contract\r\nbecomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every\r\nold blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.\r\n\r\n“The prospect of domination of the Nation’s scholars by Federal\r\nemployment, project allocations, and the power of money is very\r\npresent—and is gravely to be regarded.”\r\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower might have added that the arbitrary withholding\r\nof information from Congress and the public was the quickest way to\r\ngive this military-industrial combination the control he believed\r\nto be so dangerous. He apparently had never understood the secrecy\r\nproblem in his administration in such a way that he could see the\r\nconnection between the increase in secrecy and the decrease in\r\nliberty and other essential elements of democracy. Chairman Hardy, I\r\nmyself, and others hoped the new President would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nKennedy Makes a Wobbly Start\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident John F. Kennedy had been in office only ten days when\r\nhe gave his “State of the Union” address on January 30, 1961. His\r\ncomments on making information available to Congress were general in\r\nnature and seemingly consistent with his campaign pledges. President\r\nKennedy said:\r\n\r\n“Our Constitution wisely assigns both joint and separate roles to\r\neach branch of the Government; and a President and a Congress who\r\nhold each other in mutual respect will neither permit nor attempt any\r\ntrespass. For my part, I shall withhold from neither the Congress nor\r\nthe people any fact or report, past, present, or future, which is\r\nnecessary for an informed judgment of our conduct or hazards. I shall\r\nneither shift the burden of executive decisions to the Congress, nor\r\navoid responsibility for the outcome of those decisions.”\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy was not so specific on the subject as Candidate\r\nKennedy had been, nor was he as precise as the Democratic platform on\r\n“Freedom of Information.” The Democratic platform said:\r\n\r\n“We reject the Republican contention that the workings of government\r\nare the special private preserve of the Executive. The massive wall\r\nof secrecy erected between the Executive branch and the Congress as\r\nwell as the citizen must be torn down. Information must flow freely,\r\nsave in those areas in which the national security is involved.”\r\n\r\nDuring the 1960 campaign, President Kennedy made a most forthright\r\ndeclaration on the responsibility of the President to keep the\r\ncitizens fully informed so that democracy would flourish.\r\n\r\n“An informed citizenry is the basis of representative government,”\r\nhe said. “Democracy—as we know it—cannot exist unless the American\r\npeople are equipped with the information which is necessary if they\r\nare to make the informed political choices on which the proper\r\nfunctioning of the democracy depends. An informed people—able to\r\nexamine, and when necessary, to criticize, its government—is the only\r\nguarantee of responsible democracy.”\r\n\r\nAs a candidate, Kennedy also declared that the President had much\r\nmore than a negative duty.\r\n\r\n“The President—who himself bears much of the responsibility for the\r\npreservation of American democracy—has the affirmative duty to see\r\nthat the American people are kept fully informed. It is true that\r\nin today’s world of peril some Government information must be kept\r\nsecret—information whose publication would endanger the security of\r\nnational security—the people of the United States are entitled to the\r\nfullest possible information about their Government—and the President\r\nmust see that they receive it.”\r\n\r\nSenator Kennedy said that the “executive privilege” should be\r\nreserved for the exclusive use of the President. He added that when\r\ninformation is not restricted by specific statute, security needs, or\r\nthe Constitution, “there is no justification for using the doctrine\r\nof ‘executive privilege’ to withhold that information from Congress\r\nand the public.”\r\n\r\nOn February 4—only two weeks after Kennedy’s inauguration—Secretary\r\nof State Dean Rusk wrote Representative Porter Hardy.\r\n\r\n“Just a note to let you know that we have not forgotten the question\r\non the availability of records. I am working with our new legal\r\nadviser, Mr. Abram Chayes, and hope that he can be in touch with you\r\nduring the coming week. Let me assure you that we will move on this\r\nmatter as promptly as possible.”\r\n\r\nChairman Hardy was now optimistic about gaining access to the reports\r\nand papers of the International Cooperation Administration programs\r\nin Peru and six other Latin-American nations. Three days later,\r\nChayes called at Hardy’s office, and the following day Chairman Hardy\r\nwrote a friendly little note to Secretary of State Rusk saying that\r\nhe trusted the access problem “will be resolved quickly.”\r\n\r\nMore than two weeks passed without action, however, and with each\r\nday Chairman Hardy became more irritated. On February 28, he wrote\r\nRusk prodding him again on the need for the documents on foreign-aid\r\nprograms in Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, and\r\nColombia. The subcommittee has “directed the staff to examine\r\nall executive branch documents and files relating to the U.S.\r\naid operations in the aforesaid countries and to interview such\r\ndepartment and agency personnel as may be necessary.”\r\n\r\nThere was still no action from Secretary of State Rusk, and ten days\r\nlater Hardy had reached the end of his patience. He wrote a letter to\r\nPresident Kennedy and delivered it to the White House to President\r\nKennedy’s appointment secretary, Kenneth O’Donnell.\r\n\r\nIt was a Friday afternoon, and O’Donnell informed Chairman Hardy he\r\nwould put the letter in the President’s hands the first thing Monday\r\nmorning. Hardy said he felt this was important enough that it should\r\nbe delivered to President Kennedy that day, for he planned to conduct\r\nhearings on the affair on Monday. O’Donnell said he would get the\r\nletter to the President immediately.\r\n\r\nHardy’s letter informed President Kennedy of the background of\r\ndelays, and the promise of the new administration made to find a\r\nspeedy solution.\r\n\r\n“Seven weeks have now elapsed since the inauguration and I have no\r\nreason to believe that a workable solution is any nearer than it was\r\non December 9, 1960, under the former administration,” Hardy wrote.\r\n“You may recall that it was on that date that the Comptroller General\r\nprohibited further use of program funds for expenses of the office\r\nof the Inspector General and Comptroller because of its failure to\r\nfurnish my subcommittee with requested documents in accordance with\r\n... the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended.”\r\n\r\nHardy was polite but direct:\r\n\r\n“I regret the necessity of bringing this matter to your attention,\r\nand would be reluctant to intrude on your busy schedule if I\r\nwere not aware of the importance of this matter to you. In this\r\nconnection, I feel you should know that it is my present plan to hold\r\na meeting of my subcommittee on Monday of next week to discuss the\r\nadvisability of scheduling promptly a hearing to which Secretary Rusk\r\nwould be invited to inform the subcommittee concerning the extent\r\nof co-operation which we can expect in securing the information\r\nnecessary for us to discharge our constitutional and statutory\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\n“As I am sure you are aware, I have made every effort to avoid the\r\nnecessity of seeking a solution to the problem in this manner.\r\nHowever, I feel that the lack of success of other methods to date\r\nleaves me no alternative.”\r\n\r\nBefore Hardy had reached his home, President Kennedy had called and\r\nleft a number. This wasn’t somebody calling for the President, but\r\nthe President himself. Hardy returned the call, and was assured by\r\nPresident Kennedy that Secretary of State Rusk would be in touch with\r\nhim. Rusk called a few minutes later, and promised immediate action\r\non the information problem.\r\n\r\nHardy said that if he could be assured of getting some satisfactory\r\ndiscussions on Monday, he would be glad to wait until that day for\r\nofficial word from Rusk.\r\n\r\nRusk’s letter of Monday, March 13, stated:\r\n\r\n“The Department shares with you a deep concern that the foreign aid\r\nprograms which are so important to the success of our foreign policy,\r\nshould be administered effectively and in a manner that is above\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n“I have therefore directed the officers of the Department concerned\r\nto co-operate fully with you and your staff to expedite your\r\ninvestigation and to make available to you all information and\r\ndocuments relevant to your inquiry which we properly can.”\r\n\r\nChairman Hardy took Secretary Rusk at his word and assumed that\r\nrecords would be made available. The next morning Hardy called\r\nAssistant Secretary Brooks Hays to inform him that a staff\r\ninvestigator would be visiting the office of the Inspector\r\nGeneral and Comptroller with instructions to talk to personnel in\r\nthat office. He asked that Hays do what he could to assure that\r\nInvestigator Walton Woods receive a co-operative reception.\r\n\r\nHowever, when Woods showed up at the office of Acting Inspector\r\nGeneral James E. Nugent and asked to speak with Investigator Michael\r\nJ. Ambrose he was refused permission. Nugent said that as far as he\r\nwas concerned the orders under the Eisenhower administration were\r\nstill in force, but that he would check with Legal Counsel Chayes\r\nto see if there had been a change. Later Woods returned to Nugent’s\r\noffice and was informed by Nugent that no files or documents from\r\nthe Office of the Inspector General were to be made available to the\r\nsubcommittee.\r\n\r\nChairman Hardy was amazed that the same roadblocks continued to\r\nexist. On March 16, 1961, he again wrote Rusk relating what had\r\nhappened and commenting:\r\n\r\n“In spite of these developments I cannot believe that this\r\nadministration is disposed to adhere to the withholding policies of\r\nthe prior administration.”\r\n\r\nThen Hardy let Rusk know that despite all the roadblocks put in the\r\nway of the subcommittee, information had already been obtained that\r\nraised serious questions about the operation of the ICA policing\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n“The data which we have already assembled independently give us\r\nreason to question whether either the Office of the Inspector General\r\nand Comptroller or its predecessor organization has performed in a\r\nsatisfactory manner,” Hardy wrote.\r\n\r\n“An office like this, exercising as it does an internal watchdog\r\nfunction, is of particular concern to a subcommittee such as ours.\r\nFor when the Congress can be assured that such an office is doing a\r\ngood job, then the areas where independent congressional inquiry may\r\nbe required become fewer and smaller, and the work of Congress is\r\naccordingly simplified. Certainly we cannot evaluate the work of this\r\noffice [OIGC] in any particular, if we are not permitted full access\r\nto its files and interviews with its personnel.”\r\n\r\nWhen Chairman Hardy called a hearing five days later on March 21,\r\nthe witnesses showed up with letters of instructions flatly barring\r\ntestimony. Secretary of State Rusk supplied each witness with the\r\nform letter prohibiting free testimony “concerning the conduct of the\r\nforeign aid program in Peru.\r\n\r\n“I am writing this letter to instruct you that you are not authorized\r\nto testify concerning the contents of any files of the International\r\nCooperation Administration or the Office of the Inspector General\r\nand Comptroller in the Department of State which relates to an\r\ninvestigation into charges of misconduct on the part of individuals\r\nor corporate persons or, more generally, to testify concerning\r\nany matter involved in such an investigation carried on by the\r\nInternational Cooperation Administration or the Office of the\r\nInspector General and Comptroller in the Department of State.”\r\n\r\nSo this was what the Kennedy administration called “co-operation”\r\nto “expedite your investigation and to make available to you all\r\ninformation and documents relevant to your inquiry which we properly\r\ncan.” Chairman Hardy had hoped for better, but concluded that it was\r\ntime to end the polite letter writing and get down to tough talk.\r\n\r\n“Until this morning,” he declared, “it was my sincere hope that we\r\nwould see some real improvement.”\r\n\r\nHardy had been frustrated for a full year in his effort to gain\r\naccess to the key documents on foreign aid in Peru. And the Kennedy\r\nadministration, in office already two months, had done nothing\r\nto change the system that covered up for the dishonest and the\r\nincompetent people who wasted foreign-aid funds. Worse yet, it\r\ndeveloped that twelve witnesses Hardy called in carried identical\r\nletters of instructions from Rusk to refuse to testify or produce\r\nrecords on any investigations conducted by ICA.\r\n\r\nHardy denounced the Rusk letter as “the most arrogant instruction”\r\never given to government witnesses. Representative George Meader\r\ndeclared that “a curtain had been rung down” on the operations of the\r\nICA.\r\n\r\nMeader, the highest ranking Republican on the Hardy subcommittee,\r\ndemanded that Secretary Rusk should be brought before the\r\nsubcommittee to explain the barriers he was erecting against\r\ninvestigations by Congress.\r\n\r\nWhen Chairman Hardy agreed to call Rusk the very next day, State\r\nDepartment officials said “it would be very difficult” for Rusk to\r\nappear at that time for he was leaving the following evening for\r\nBangkok and a major international conference of the Southeast Asia\r\nTreaty Organization nations.\r\n\r\nHardy declared that Rusk would be summoned before the subcommittee\r\nwhen he returned from the international conference, and that in the\r\nmeantime he would be calling all other responsible State Department\r\nofficials in an effort to get to the bottom of the stalling.\r\n\r\nFor the record, he reviewed the long struggle to get information on\r\nthe Peru program from the Eisenhower administration. He also related\r\nthe details of the patient two-month wait to give the Kennedy\r\nadministration sufficient time to examine the problem carefully.\r\n\r\nThen, to light a fire under the issue, Chairman Hardy disclosed\r\nenough information to make it obvious that he was on the trail of\r\nmultimillion-dollar scandals in the handling of foreign aid in Peru.\r\nHe revealed that 2 million dollars in U.S. funds were spent on a\r\nfarm-to-market highway which led only to unarable mountainous land.\r\nIt was started before plans were completed, plans were changed while\r\nit was being constructed, and the funds ran out when it was only half\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nHe also told about an irrigation project built at Pampas de Noco. It\r\ncost $125,000 of Americans’ money, but it didn’t work because there\r\nsimply was not enough water available in the area to make use of the\r\nprojected irrigation works.\r\n\r\nJohn R. Neale, director of the United States Operations Mission in\r\nPeru, had acquired a $200,000 interest in a ranching corporation that\r\nreceived aid under the U.S. program. Although Neale had resigned\r\nin 1958, there were indications that key ICA and State Department\r\npersonnel had protected him from a thorough investigation for months.\r\n\r\nHardy revealed widespread irregularities in the 14-million-dollar\r\ndrought relief program in Peru. He had testimony that as much as 60\r\nper cent of the so-called “drought relief” went into unauthorized\r\nchannels and was no help to the drought victims.\r\n\r\nChairman Hardy made certain that President Kennedy was apprised\r\nof the nature of the mismanagement and fraud being hidden by the\r\nState Department. The reaction was fast, and the Rusk letter of\r\ninstructions was slapped down by the White House on direct orders\r\nfrom President Kennedy.\r\n\r\nBrooks Hays, the former congressman and Assistant Secretary of\r\nState for Congressional Relations, assured Chairman Hardy that the\r\nRusk instructions would be rescinded, the documents released, and\r\nwitnesses freed to testify.\r\n\r\nWitnesses called by Hardy a week later, on March 29, did testify\r\nfreely. These witnesses produced a letter from State Department Legal\r\nCounsel Abram J. Chayes instructing them to forget the whole thing.\r\nChayes wrote:\r\n\r\n“The instructions contained in the letter of March 21, 1961,\r\naddressed to you by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, are hereby\r\nwithdrawn. In view of this fact, I would appreciate it if you would\r\nreturn the letter to me and treat it as though it had not been sent.”\r\n\r\nNothing that Chayes could write, however, could erase from some\r\npeople’s minds the memory of this clumsy and arrogant effort\r\nof the State Department to withhold. To ensure its perpetuity,\r\nRepresentative Meader rose on the House floor two weeks later, on\r\nApril 17, to recite the story for the _Congressional Record_.\r\n\r\n“In recent years, ambitious bureaucrats have concocted and promoted\r\nthe so-called doctrine of ‘executive privilege,’ which, in my\r\njudgment, is a myth,” Meader said. “In my view, there is no right or\r\npower in the executive branch of the Government to decide what facts\r\nCongress needs concerning the conduct of the public business.... That\r\ndecision is clearly and properly a legislative decision.”\r\n\r\nMeader declared that “the struggle between bureaucrats who wish to\r\nhide their activities and committees of Congress insisting on access\r\nto complete and accurate information concerning public business ...\r\nhas not received the attention it merits.”\r\n\r\nThe Michigan congressman was a Republican, to be sure, but he was one\r\nof a handful who could not be accused of playing partisan politics\r\nwith this issue. No man in Congress insisted any more aggressively\r\nthan George Meader that the Eisenhower administration make records\r\navailable to the public, to Congress and the General Accounting\r\nOffice. When Meader quoted President Kennedy’s January 30 address on\r\nthe state of the Union, he did not do so in a malicious or partisan\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nKennedy had said: “For my part, I shall withhold from neither the\r\nCongress nor the people, any fact or report, past, present or future,\r\nwhich is necessary for an informed judgment of our conduct and\r\nhazards.”\r\n\r\n“I wish this sentence could be printed in capital letters in the\r\n_Congressional Record_,” Meader said. “Many of us welcomed that\r\nclear, forthright statement as heralding a new policy in the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government with respect to furnishing\r\ninformation to congressional committees on request.”\r\n\r\nRepresentative Meader was not critical of President Kennedy for the\r\ndelays on Peru, for President Kennedy had personally overridden his\r\nSecretary of State. But Meader was wary of the future.\r\n\r\n“As the bureaus and agencies in the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment have grown in number, and in power,” he said, “there\r\nhas been a parallel growth in their efforts to shroud in secrecy\r\nthe manner in which they discharge their stewardship of the public\r\nauthority and moneys entrusted to them.”\r\n\r\nMeader declared that “the question remained whether that laudable\r\ngenerality [in President Kennedy’s address of January 30] would\r\nbe actually carried out in practice” or whether there would be\r\n“procrastination and recalcitrance on the part of officials.”\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks of the March 29, 1961, showdown, the Hardy\r\nsubcommittee was receiving the documents on the U.S. aid program\r\nin Peru. These were the documents, the release of which Attorney\r\nGeneral William P. Rogers had said “would gravely impair the proper\r\nfunctioning and administration of the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment.”\r\n\r\nWhat the reports did do was to document fully the sloppy, wasteful,\r\nand corrupt administration of foreign aid in Peru.\r\n\r\nFrom the outset the Peru drought relief program had been riddled with\r\nirregularities. There were shipments of 106,000 tons of grain meant\r\nto be sold to help needy drought victims but which were sold, without\r\nauthorization, to pay administrative costs, port charges, and inland\r\ntransportation costs. Above all, the grain was not meant to be sold,\r\nas it was, for the profiteering of grain millers in Peru. It wasn’t\r\nto be sold to raise money to buy houses to be sold to influential\r\nPeruvians at less than cost.\r\n\r\nThe mismanagement of the program was so raw that it hadn’t completely\r\nescaped detection in Washington. A desk officer in 1957 had figured\r\nthat only 12,000 tons of the first 45,000 tons had been accounted for\r\nand asked: “Who received the rest of the grain?”\r\n\r\nNo one answered his question, however, either in the Washington ICA\r\noffice or at the Embassy in Peru. When a Washington auditor was\r\nfinally sent to Peru, he found that no end-use checks had been made\r\nby the United States Operations Mission (USOM). He stated:\r\n\r\n“The lone USOM auditor, a local employee, stated that USOM officials\r\nissued orders that no checks were to be made beyond the offices of\r\nthe committees selling [drought aid] foods. Thus, end users were\r\nnot contacted and no determination could be made as to the proper\r\nutilization of food.”\r\n\r\nWithin the State Department and the ICA no aggressive action was\r\ntaken to find out whether there was any substance to the complaints\r\nof conflicts of interest, waste, and major misuse of funds. Lethargy,\r\nincompetence, excuses, and cover-up prevailed.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Raymond C. Gibson, an employee of the Office of Education,\r\nreturned from an official visit in Peru, he called attention of high\r\nofficials of ICA to the activities of John R. Neale, head of the USOM\r\nin Peru, who had a large interest in a farm receiving benefits of ICA\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nInstead of investigating Neale’s holdings, top ICA officials\r\ncharacterized Gibson’s complaint as “character assassination.” The\r\nofficials did assign an investigator to the case but told him to\r\n“assure Neale of our belief in his integrity.”\r\n\r\nWithin a few months, the case had become known within ICA not as the\r\nNeale case, but the Gibson case. ICA started a full field background\r\ninvestigation of Dr. Gibson, and one official pledged to hold Dr.\r\nGibson to “full accountability” for filing a complaint against Neale.\r\n\r\nThe ICA investigators overlooked information in the ICA files\r\nwhich disclosed that Neale’s family had an interest in a Peru\r\nranch. Continued complaints finally forced ICA hearings on Neale in\r\n1958, but even then his character witnesses included the American\r\nAmbassador to Peru, Theodore Achilles, and Rollin S. Atwood, regional\r\ndirector of the Office of Latin-American Operations of the ICA.\r\n\r\n“When Achilles and Atwood appeared before the ICA hearing board as\r\ncharacter witnesses for Neale, they seemed more concerned with the\r\nmotivations of the complainants than they were with the truth of\r\ntheir allegation,” the report of the Hardy subcommittee stated.\r\n\r\n“The high position of Neale and the high position of his uncritical\r\nsupporters, Atwood and Achilles, somewhat cowed the investigators\r\nassigned to this case.\r\n\r\n“At the time of his removal, Neale had been affiliated with the Bazo\r\nCorporation [the ranching operation] for over eight years, and for\r\nat least four of those years ICA had in its possession sufficient\r\ninformation to warrant an investigation which ... would have turned\r\nup the basic facts.\r\n\r\n“It was congressional intervention that precipitated the Guinane\r\ninvestigation”—the final investigation that brought about Neale’s\r\nresignation.\r\n\r\n“All employees of ICA seem to know, without being specifically\r\ninstructed,” the subcommittee report went on, “that the preferred\r\npolicy of the agency, and the Embassy in this instance, is to brush\r\nthis sort of instance under the rug, with a quiet ‘resignation’ or\r\n‘retirement.’”\r\n\r\n“Although the old office of Personnel Security and Integrity in ICA\r\nwas primarily responsible for the ineffective investigation in the\r\nNeale case, its successor, OIGC, did not perform with any more credit\r\nin a related matter.”\r\n\r\nThe ICA had used “executive privilege” to cover up its failures for\r\nseveral years. Instead of learning from past failures, the agency\r\ncontinued its negligence with full confidence that “executive\r\nprivilege” could hide the failures from Congress, the General\r\nAccounting Office and the public.\r\n\r\nThe details of the scandals had not been known to President\r\nEisenhower, nor had he known of the incredible laxity in the\r\ninvestigative units in the ICA. However, by promoting a secrecy cloak\r\nfor the investigators of ICA he had allowed the ICA to hide the major\r\ndefects in a vital part of an agency administering approximately 4\r\nbillion dollars a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA Pending Problem for JFK\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its first year, the Kennedy administration had tackled the problem\r\nof secrecy with noble thoughts and brave deeds. President Kennedy\r\ncould not have spoken more clearly on the need for open government\r\nin a democratic society. Moreover, he had followed up his words with\r\nstringent action by overruling Secretary of State Dean Rusk on the\r\none occasion when the State Department had tried to hide records\r\nbehind a claim of “executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nChairman Edward Hebert said that his Armed Services subcommittee was\r\nreceiving better co-operation than it had ever received from the\r\nDefense Department. Hebert had talked with President Kennedy and been\r\nassured that the administration felt it needed the help and prodding\r\nof a committee of Congress to cut the billions in wasteful defense\r\nspending.\r\n\r\nThe investigations by Chairman Porter Hardy were proceeding on the\r\nsame note of co-operation, and the Virginia Democrat said he was\r\n“hopeful that it will continue.” Chairman Hardy’s subcommittee\r\nhad a number of investigations of foreign aid under way, and he\r\nbelieved that some of these investigations would be a real test of\r\nthe sincerity and consistency of the Kennedy administration stand on\r\n“executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nThough many good signs indicated the Kennedy administration meant\r\nwhat it said about an open information policy, there were other\r\nsigns that did not augur so well. Perhaps the most important was\r\nPresident Kennedy’s personal sensitivity to criticism and his\r\ninclination to try to punish those he regarded as being “enemies” or\r\nunfairly critical.\r\n\r\nThe President himself had telephoned reporters and editors to\r\ncomplain about stories he considered unfair or unfavorable to him or\r\nhis administration. At one time, the reporters for _Time_ magazine\r\nwere cut off from contact with White House sources on a direct order\r\nfrom the President. The order was lifted in about two weeks, after\r\nPresident Kennedy and his assistants felt _Time’s_ reporters and\r\neditors had been given a lesson.\r\n\r\nOther persons in the White House behaved even tougher, threatening\r\nretaliation against reporters they felt had done them damage. Lloyd\r\nNorman, Pentagon correspondent for _Newsweek_ magazine, became the\r\ntarget of an FBI investigation when he beat his colleagues with an\r\nexclusive report on the alternative plans for action on the Berlin\r\ncrisis. The investigation was instigated despite the fact that before\r\npublication the report was read by a high White House figure who\r\nraised no question as to the propriety of printing it.\r\n\r\nA memorandum by Frederick G. Dutton, Special Assistant to the\r\nPresident, contained language on government information policies that\r\n“shocked” Representative John Moss. The Dutton memorandum of July\r\n20, 1961, was attached to a Civil Service Commission statement on\r\nstandards of conduct for government employees. It stated:\r\n\r\n“Employees may not disclose official information without either\r\nappropriate general or specific authority under agency regulations.”\r\n\r\nCongressman Moss asked the White House for a “complete reversal” of\r\nthe statement, plus a “positive directive to all employees to honor\r\nthe people’s right to know as a routine matter in the conduct of\r\ngovernment business.\r\n\r\n“This restrictive attitude expressed by this [Dutton] language is a\r\ncomplete reversal of all of the policies which the House government\r\ninformation subcommittee has supported for many years,” Moss wrote\r\nto Dutton. “It is also a direct contradiction of the clear position\r\nwhich President Kennedy has taken....”\r\n\r\nThe White House immediately withdrew the Dutton memorandum and\r\nasserted the right of the people to be informed about government\r\noperations. The incident nevertheless underscored the need for\r\nconstant vigilance to prevent directives that in substance tell\r\ngovernment employees to keep their mouths shut.\r\n\r\nAt the Pentagon there were also a few unhealthy signs that bore\r\nwatching. Defense Secretary Robert Strange McNamara was generally\r\npraised as a bright, able, and hard-working public official, but his\r\nperformance in the information area did not elicit equally laudatory\r\ncomments. Though McNamara’s press chief, Assistant Secretary of\r\nDefense Arthur Sylvester, had served for years as a reporter in the\r\nWashington Bureau of the Newark _News_, he was sharply critical of\r\nthe press in his first months in office. He did little to smooth the\r\nroad for the Defense Secretary or to educate McNamara’s attitudes on\r\nfreedom of information.\r\n\r\nTestimony released in May 1961 by the Senate Committee on Armed\r\nServices disclosed that McNamara appeared to favor less information\r\nfor the public as well as misinformation on our military developments.\r\n\r\n“Why should we tell Russia that the Zeus development may not be\r\nsatisfactory?” McNamara asked the Armed Services Committee. “What we\r\nought to be saying is that we have the most perfect anti-ICBM system\r\nthat the human mind will ever devise. Instead, the public domain is\r\nalready full of statements that the Zeus may not be satisfactory,\r\nthat it has deficiencies. I think it is absurd to release that kind\r\nof information.”\r\n\r\nThe McNamara statement was met with immediate criticism from\r\nRepresentative John E. Moss, chairman of the House Government\r\nInformation Subcommittee. Moss, a Democrat, declared that McNamara’s\r\ntestimony was “a gross disservice” to the people of the United\r\nStates and inconsistent with views expressed by President Kennedy.\r\nHe asked how the McNamara statement could be reconciled with\r\nPresident Kennedy’s pledge to “withhold from neither the Congress\r\nnor the people any fact or report, past, present or future, which is\r\nnecessary for an informed judgment of our conduct and hazards.”\r\n\r\nRepresentative Moss declared that “advocacy of a program of\r\nmisinformation constitutes a grave disservice to a nation already\r\nconfused and suffering from informational malnutrition. To claim\r\nperfection in a weapon system, thereby creating a false sense of\r\nsecurity, only results in complacency complained about by the very\r\nofficials who would further feed it.”\r\n\r\nMcNamara, Moss said, “expressed an attitude which while not new is\r\nnevertheless most alarming.”\r\n\r\nIn the face of a barrage of similar criticism, the Defense Department\r\nhurriedly released a statement that McNamara did not mean to mislead\r\nthe American people but only the Russians.\r\n\r\nAt his press conference on May 26, 1961, the Defense Secretary issued\r\na four-point statement to serve as a guide on information policy.\r\nMcNamara, forty-four-year-old Phi Beta Kappa and a former assistant\r\nprofessor of business administration at Harvard, had learned at least\r\nwhat his published position must be.\r\n\r\n“In a democratic society,” his clarification began, “the public must\r\nbe kept informed of the major issues in our national defense policy.”\r\n\r\nWhile pointing out the need to avoid disclosure of information\r\nthat might aid our potential enemies, he declared it “is equally\r\nimportant to avoid overclassification. I suggest that we follow this\r\nprinciple: When in doubt underclassify.”\r\n\r\nThe Defense Secretary also said that public statements must reflect\r\nthe policy of the Defense Department, and that Defense personnel\r\nshould not discuss “foreign policy subjects, a field which is\r\nreserved for the President and the Secretary of State.”\r\n\r\nRepresentative Moss commended Defense Secretary McNamara for\r\n“recognition of the people’s right to know.” He singled out for\r\npraise the McNamara comment that “the public has at least as much\r\nright to bad news as good news.” However, he reserved judgment on the\r\ninstructions restricting comment on policy matters. Moss asked to be\r\nadvised on all directives or other instructions used in implementing\r\nthe general information policy. He had learned by now that fine\r\npolicy statements can mask the most intolerable withholding of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe reasonableness of the general policy statements on Defense\r\ninformation could hardly be criticized, but complaints were beginning\r\nto be heard about a tightening of curbs on speeches by military\r\nofficers and about the difficulty of access to personnel at the\r\nPentagon.\r\n\r\n_The Navy Times_, a private publication, commented:\r\n\r\n“Americans generally ought to be having some misgivings over the\r\ncurrent trend at the Pentagon. There’s an air of secrecy, of\r\ncensorship, of arbitrary rulings.”\r\n\r\nThe Defense Department toyed with the idea of invoking “executive\r\nprivilege” when two committees of Congress initiated investigations\r\nof shipments of strategic materials to various Iron Curtain\r\ncountries. The Internal Security Subcommittee of the Senate and\r\na House Select Committee on Export Control were embarking on a\r\nrepetition of the East-West trade investigations that Robert\r\nKennedy, then a committee lawyer, had directed five years earlier.\r\nAs Attorney General, Robert Kennedy advised against the use of\r\n“executive privilege.”\r\n\r\nDespite assurances that the Kennedy administration would not claim\r\n“executive privilege,” Chairman Porter Hardy wanted the law to state\r\nthat reports of the Inspector General and Comptroller on foreign-aid\r\nadministration would be made available to Congress and the General\r\nAccounting Office (GAO) auditors. Promises were fine, but Chairman\r\nHardy wanted a firm law to bolster his subcommittee’s authority to\r\nobtain records on foreign-aid spending.\r\n\r\nHardy’s amendment to the foreign-aid legislation of 1961 provided\r\nthat if the Inspector General and Comptroller failed to make\r\ninformation available to Congress and the GAO auditors, their funds\r\nwould be cut off by GAO. The House gave the amendment overwhelming\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, however—with support from the Kennedy\r\nadministration—emasculated the Hardy amendment by adding what\r\nRepresentative George Meader described as the “Presidential escape\r\nclause.” This clause provided that the Executive can avoid furnishing\r\ninformation on foreign-aid expenditures upon a “certification by the\r\nPresident that he has forbidden the furnishing thereof pursuant to\r\nsuch request and his reason for so doing.”\r\n\r\nRepresentatives Hardy and Meader remembered the experience with\r\na similar escape clause that was attached to the foreign-aid\r\nlegislation of 1959. It had enabled President Eisenhower simply to\r\nsign a certification in order to bar Senate and House investigators\r\nfrom every key record they sought dealing with mismanagement of the\r\nforeign-aid program. The proof of the weakness of a law with such\r\nan escape clause had caused the Congress to pass the tight Hardy\r\namendment in 1960. Although President Eisenhower defied the specific\r\nintent of the Hardy amendment by hiding the Peru foreign-aid records,\r\nthe 1960 provisions had been considered strong enough for a court\r\ntest if Eisenhower had remained in office.\r\n\r\nThe Kennedy administration’s support of the “Presidential escape\r\nclause” in the 1961 legislation was a bad omen to Representative\r\nMeader.\r\n\r\n“The effect of the Presidential escape clause ...” he said, “is to\r\nweaken existing law and to diminish the power the Congress enjoyed\r\nduring [the last year of] the Eisenhower administration to obtain\r\ninformation from the Executive of foreign aid expenditures.\r\n\r\n“This constitutes a victory for the bureaucrats, a defeat for\r\nCongress, and a serious setback in the fight against government\r\nsecrecy.”\r\n\r\nCriticism of the Kennedy administration from some Republicans\r\ncould be disregarded. But from George Meader it invited serious\r\nattention. As the foregoing chapters have shown, he was one of the\r\nmost outspoken critics of the information policies of the Eisenhower\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nMeader had joined Representative Hardy, a Democrat, in criticizing\r\nthe State Department in March when Secretary of State Rusk issued\r\norders barring the Hardy committee from testimony or records on the\r\nPeru scandals. But he had also joined Hardy in applauding President\r\nKennedy for overruling his own Secretary of State and making the\r\nICA records on Peru foreign-aid scandals available to the Hardy\r\nsubcommittee.\r\n\r\nOn July 28, 1961, the Democratic-controlled House Government\r\nOperations Committee issued a report on information policies. It\r\nwas, of course, highly critical of the Eisenhower administration but\r\nnot completely approving of the new administration. The committee\r\nfound the record of the first months of the Kennedy administration\r\n“mixed.” However, it saw a “hopeful note” in the fact that President\r\nKennedy had given “positive policy direction from the top.”\r\nThe report contained a favorable comment on “the Presidential\r\ndetermination—even at the cost of reversing his Secretary of State—to\r\nlive up to the new administration’s pledge to honor the right to\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nDemocrats took great party pride in the speeches President Kennedy\r\nmade to assure the public of his concern for freedom of information.\r\n\r\n“The essence of free communication must be that our failures as well\r\nas our successes will be broadcast around the world,” President\r\nKennedy said at the convention of the National Association of\r\nBroadcasters. “And therefore we take double pride in our successes.\r\n\r\n“The great inner resource of freedom, the resource which has kept the\r\nworld’s oldest democracy continuously young and vital, the resource\r\nwhich has always brought us our greatest exploits in time of our\r\ngreatest need, is the very fact of the open society.\r\n\r\n“Thus, if we are once again to preserve our civilization, it will\r\nbe because of our freedom, and not in spite of it.... For the flow\r\nof ideas, the capacity to make informed choices, the ability to\r\ncriticize, all the assumptions upon which political democracy rests,\r\ndepends largely upon communication.”\r\n\r\nBy the time the House Government Operations Committee was ready\r\nto file a second report on government information policies, the\r\nDemocrats were aglow with admiration for President Kennedy. The\r\nSeptember 21, 1961, report stated: “For the first time since the\r\nsubcommittee entered the fight against excessive Government secrecy\r\nsix years ago, there is a powerful new weapon—the support of a\r\nPresident who is clearly on record in favor of the greatest flow of\r\nGovernment information.”\r\n\r\nRepresentative Meader thought the Democrats were too willing to\r\npraise a Democratic administration. In his dissent, he wrote:\r\n\r\n“I cannot subscribe to the majority report because in my judgment it\r\nhas political overtones and accepts the self-serving declarations of\r\nofficials in the new administration rather than actual performance\r\nas indicating an improvement in the attitude of the executive branch\r\ntoward providing information to the Congress and the public.\r\n\r\n“The majority condemns the Eisenhower administration record\r\non secrecy in government while praising that of the Kennedy\r\nadministration. Such a distinction in my opinion, is not justified.”\r\n\r\nMeader well remembered the fine words spoken in 1952 and 1953 on same\r\nsubject by officials of the Eisenhower administration. He knew that\r\nthe true test of the Kennedy administration lay not with words but\r\nwith the administration’s continued willingness to support the power\r\nof inquiry of the Congress.\r\n\r\nA few days after the release of the House report and Meader’s\r\ndissent, Attorney General Kennedy upheld the importance of\r\ninvestigations by Congress.\r\n\r\nOn the “Meet the Press” television show on September 24, James\r\nReston, Bureau Chief for The New York _Times_, said to Attorney\r\nGeneral Kennedy:\r\n\r\n“In the field of ‘executive privilege’ ... you seem more willing than\r\nprevious Presidents and administrations to give information sought by\r\nCongress.”\r\n\r\n“As far as ‘executive privilege’ is concerned,” the Attorney General\r\nanswered, “I was associated with a congressional committee for\r\nfive or six years and had battles with the executive branch of the\r\ngovernment regarding obtaining information.\r\n\r\n“I think it is terribly important to insure that the executive branch\r\nof the government is not corrupt and that they are efficient, that\r\nthe legislative branch of the government has the ability to check on\r\nwhat we are doing in the executive branch of the government.\r\n\r\n“So, in every instance that has been brought to our attention in the\r\nDepartment of Justice so far by various departments of the executive\r\nbranch where this question has been raised we have suggested and\r\nrecommended that they make the information available to Congress.\r\nWe will continue to do that. I don’t say that there might not be an\r\ninstance where ‘executive privilege’ might be used, but I think it is\r\nterribly important that the executive branch of the government, as\r\npowerful and strong as it is, that there be some check and balance on\r\nit, and in the last analysis the group that can best check and insure\r\nthat it is handling its affairs properly is the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, so we will lean over backwards to make sure that they\r\nget the information they request.”\r\n\r\nThere was no reason to doubt the sincerity of the youthful Attorney\r\nGeneral, and in fact there was every reason to believe he meant what\r\nhe said. He was speaking from personal experience, he seemed to speak\r\nwith conviction, and it was not yet time to be posturing for the 1964\r\npolitical campaign.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, relatively easy to take a broad view at this time\r\nwhen opening records could only expose crimes or mismanagement that\r\nhad developed when the Eisenhower administration was in power. It\r\nwould take more courage and great understanding of government to open\r\nrecords that might expose a trusted Kennedy subordinate or embarrass\r\nthe Kennedy administration.\r\n\r\nBarely more than a year after the Kennedy administration had taken\r\noffice, a situation arose which raised grave question as to what its\r\nlong-range policy would be. In February 1962, during the hearings on\r\nalleged muzzling of military officers, President Kennedy invoked the\r\nclaim of “executive privilege” at the request of Defense Secretary\r\nRobert McNamara. McNamara wished to avoid identifying for the Senate\r\nPreparedness Subcommittee the Pentagon officials who had censored\r\nspecific speeches by high military officers.\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy’s letter to McNamara of February 8, 1962 (see\r\nAppendix D), set out an ill-defined claim that the national interest\r\nwas at stake. The letter contained some terminology that seemed to\r\nclaim an absolute right to bar testimony before Congress by any\r\nsubordinate career officials. It was attacked by Senator Strom\r\nThurmond, the South Carolina Democrat, as a “dangerous” precedent\r\nthat would have barred Congress from investigating the Pearl Harbor\r\ndisaster or obtaining information on a wide variety of scandals.\r\n\r\nMany political writers excused President Kennedy. Some pointed to\r\nlanguage in the letter they said indicated that he was not setting\r\na broad precedent but was merely shutting off an investigation they\r\nconsidered to be senseless. Representative Moss declared that the\r\nSenate subcommittee had the legal right to ask the questions to\r\ndetermine which censors had blue-penciled which speeches.\r\n\r\nIt was not clear immediately whether the February 8 letter was to\r\nbe an isolated incident or a troublesome broad precedent for more\r\narbitrary secrecy in the tradition of the May 17, 1954, Eisenhower\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA Solution\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory establishes that any administration may be afflicted with\r\nlaxity, incompetence, and even outright fraud. History has also\r\ntaught that any administration can harbor men who want to hide\r\nmistakes and corruption.\r\n\r\nIt is true that no President has been directly involved in fraudulent\r\nactivity, and it seems unlikely that any ever will be. Holding such\r\na high office would inspire almost any man to rise above the desire\r\nfor personal enrichment, particularly if the cost might be damaging\r\nto his place in history. But any President might be tempted to hide\r\nrecords on a claim of “executive privilege” if he felt he could save\r\nsome trusted subordinate from the slings of the opposition political\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIn varying degrees, our Presidents have been dependent upon a\r\npalace guard. The nature of the position, with all its vast\r\nresponsibilities, makes a circle of close advisers inevitable.\r\nThus Presidents of the past have sought information about alleged\r\nimproprieties or corruptions from the very men who have been accused\r\nof perpetrating them. Instead of facts and a clear analysis of the\r\nproblem—whether it was Teapot Dome, tax scandals, or Dixon-Yates—the\r\nPresidents have received misinformation and excuses. The accusations\r\nhave been explained away to our Presidents as partisan complaints\r\nfrom politicians maliciously bent on destroying the administration’s\r\nprograms. Such explanations from palace guards unfortunately have\r\nbeen all too effective and have obscured the facts that would have\r\nalerted our Presidents to conflicts of interest, favoritism, and\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy and future Presidents will face the same kind of\r\npitfalls. Regardless of their own integrity, they cannot be expected\r\nto conduct personal investigations of each of their subordinates. The\r\nPresidents and the people must therefore depend upon investigations\r\nfrom outside the executive branch—by the Congress and the General\r\nAccounting Office—for an aggressive search for the facts.\r\n\r\nInvestigations by Congress have demonstrated the failure of the\r\nmilitary departments to police themselves effectively from the\r\ninside. In every recent year, the Congress and the GAO have\r\npinpointed the waste of hundreds of millions of dollars on\r\ninefficient, incompetent, or corrupt handling of Defense contract\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nExamination of testimony on the foreign-aid programs in Laos and Peru\r\nshows that the State Department is little better than the Defense\r\nDepartment in rooting out mismanagement and corruption. There are\r\ndozens of other areas within the bureaucracy where the record is just\r\nas bad.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful that we will ever eliminate corruption in the federal\r\ngovernment, but it must be kept under closer control or it can spread\r\nwith devastating impact. Nothing speeds the growth of corruption\r\nmore than policies that foster arbitrary secrecy. Secrecy allows\r\nlittle scandals to become major scandals, costly to the taxpayers,\r\ndevastating to our foreign-aid program, to our position of defense\r\nreadiness, and to our national morale.\r\n\r\n“Secrecy,” as the House Government Operations Committee has put it,\r\n“is the handmaiden of bureaucracy, especially military bureaucracy.\r\nIt has so pervasive an effect that all government becomes invested\r\nwith the urge to restrict—even those routine agencies which should be\r\nwide open to the public.”\r\n\r\nIn these pages, I have not attempted to examine every agency of\r\ngovernment. I have examined enough, however, to show how severe the\r\ninfection of secrecy has become, what dire symptoms it produces, and\r\nhow seriously it threatens the health of our democracy.\r\n\r\nIt can be wiped out. As treatment for a permanent cure, I suggest the\r\nfollowing steps:\r\n\r\n1 _All officials except the President should be obligated to explain\r\nall their actions to Congress and the General Accounting Office,\r\nunless specific laws are passed for withholding information._ This\r\ndoes not mean that the public or Congress should have access to all\r\npapers when a decision is pending, but at a later date Congress\r\nshould have access to all records and testimony concerning events\r\nleading up to the executive decisions.\r\n\r\nA good example from recent history that shows the value of a properly\r\nconducted hearing was the Senate investigation of President Truman’s\r\nfiring of General Douglas MacArthur in 1951.\r\n\r\nThe special Senate committee—selected with a reasonably even division\r\nof political forces from the Armed Services and Foreign Relations\r\ncommittees—did not seek testimony from President Truman. However, it\r\ndid require the testimony of General Omar Bradley, the Chairman of\r\nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. Bradley testified on all events leading up\r\nto the firing, including his meeting with President Truman. Bradley\r\nwas not asked to recount verbatim his discussion with President\r\nTruman, but he testified he met with President Truman, that the\r\nMacArthur actions were discussed, and the decision was made by\r\nPresident Truman to fire General MacArthur.\r\n\r\nThe special Senate committee met behind closed doors but released a\r\ndaily transcript of testimony that had been examined to eliminate any\r\nmatter that might violate national military security standards.\r\n\r\nHad the Eisenhower administration’s doctrine of “executive privilege”\r\nprevailed at that time, a total secrecy blanket could have been\r\nthrown around the Defense Department, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and\r\nthe White House. There would have been no way of determining the\r\nfacts leading up to the decision, except as the President found it\r\nconvenient to reveal them.\r\n\r\nHow much better it was for all concerned that the MacArthur firing\r\nwas carefully examined and that the public was apprised of all the\r\nmaterial facts.\r\n\r\n2 _Congress should enact special laws to cover the specific areas in\r\nwhich withholding of records is deemed necessary to the public good._\r\nThere are now laws that provide for withholding of federal income\r\ntax information from the public, and from all committees of Congress\r\nexcept certain ones with supervisory jurisdiction over the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. Laws have been enacted providing for withholding of\r\nDefense information that involves national security. Other areas—FBI\r\nreports, patent secrets, business reports, or personnel files—could\r\nbe covered by special legislation of a similar nature, but modified\r\nto meet the requirements of the area in which the withholding is\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n3 _Congress should provide stiff criminal penalties for use against\r\ngovernment officials who withhold information from properly\r\nauthorized committees of Congress or the GAO._ This legislation\r\nshould also provide the mechanism for prosecution to be initiated by\r\nthe Congress or the GAO. Such a mechanism is necessary to avoid the\r\nsituation wherein an Attorney General, advocate for the President\r\nand appointed by the President, simply refuses to enforce the law or\r\ngives patently false legal opinions to avoid enforcement.\r\n\r\n4 _The Congress should establish an effective means for systematic\r\nreview of papers carrying national security classifications of\r\n“confidential,” “secret,” or “top secret.” Or the President could\r\nestablish a small committee to spot-check, review, and challenge\r\nquestionable use of national security classifications._ However the\r\nreview group is set up, its members should be selected from outside\r\nthe military field, and they should be persons with a strong and\r\nresponsible interest in open government. They should have authority\r\nto challenge arbitrary or questionable security classifications and\r\nauthority to obtain explanations from all persons with a role in\r\nquestionable classifications.\r\n\r\nThis review group should not have the power to change\r\nclassifications, only the power to recommend changes. It should\r\nhave the authority, however, to file reports with Congress, with\r\ndepartment heads, and with the President that could be made public.\r\nSuch reports should identify individuals engaged in arbitrary or\r\nquestionable overclassification, as well as those responsible for\r\nfailing to take steps to declassify.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnly through the establishment of these checks on executive secrecy\r\ncan the public be assured that laws are administered in the way that\r\nthe Congress intended them to be. Only in this way can the public be\r\ncertain that the laws are not twisted or disregarded by an arbitrary\r\nbureaucracy operating in secret.\r\n\r\nAnd what about checks upon possible abuses by the investigating\r\ncommittees of Congress? There are many. The courts offer some of the\r\nmost effective. Rulings in recent years have put limitations on the\r\npower of an investigating committee. The committee must be properly\r\nauthorized by the House or Senate, with a specific authority, and it\r\nmust operate within the scope of that authority. The courts will not\r\nuphold a contempt citation if a committee of Congress is operating\r\noutside its proper authority, or if the questions asked are not\r\npertinent to the inquiry. Recent rulings have held that the committee\r\nchairman must also explain to the witness the reasons why the\r\nquestions are pertinent and necessary to carry out the legislative\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these legal limitations, committees of Congress are\r\nheld in check by their own bipartisanship and the fact that they\r\nusually operate in the public view. The members of the committees\r\nnearly always represent a cross section of the Congress, everything\r\nfrom extreme liberals to extreme conservatives with many gradations\r\nbetween. This representation assures a spokesman for almost every\r\npoint of view. It also assures cross examination of witnesses in most\r\ncases, for minority counsel is normally provided to help minority\r\nmembers bring out facts that the majority may choose to overlook or\r\nminimize.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, most committees have adopted rules of procedure to\r\nassure some element of fair play. Since most hearings are held in\r\npublic, there is the opportunity for the press and other interested\r\ngroups and individuals to view the questioning and to point out any\r\nlapses in fair play.\r\n\r\nOpen congressional hearings do not absolutely assure fair play, but\r\nthey do represent the best practical means this country has so far\r\ndevised for assuring the public’s right to know about the running of\r\nits government.\r\n\r\nIt is pertinent to note here that in England, which is generally\r\nregarded by political authorities as a model for democratic\r\nprocedures, the need for constant inquiry into governmental policies\r\nand administration of the laws is fully recognized.\r\n\r\nThe British Government, unlike ours, is totally responsible to the\r\nParliament, with the Prime Minister and other ministers coming out\r\nof the Parliament. This system has resulted in the development of\r\na number of devices to accomplish the same basic purpose that our\r\ncongressional investigations should accomplish.\r\n\r\nThere is a “question time” in Parliament four days a week during\r\nwhich any member of the House of Commons may interrogate the various\r\nministers and even the Prime Minister. This periodic opportunity for\r\nquestioning makes it possible for the opposition either to obtain\r\nimmediate answers or to demonstrate evasiveness on crucial issues.\r\n\r\nAlso the Parliament is free to investigate through select committees\r\nof the House of Commons which are unlimited in their power to compel\r\ntestimony and production of records and to punish for contempt.\r\nThe contempt can be punished by jailing by the Parliament for the\r\nduration of the term, and British courts have left this power\r\nunlimited over the years.\r\n\r\nThe “question time” and select committees are supplemented by Royal\r\nCommissions of Inquiry, technically established and appointed by the\r\nCrown and Tribunals of Inquiry, established by the Parliament with\r\nmembers named by the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Commissions have had no power to compel testimony and\r\nproduction of records. However, co-operation is usually obtained\r\nbecause of the pressure of British public opinion, as well as the\r\never-present threat that a select committee of the Commons can take\r\njurisdiction and use its contempt powers to force testimony.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunals of Inquiry operate with the normal court powers of\r\nsubpoena and oaths to compel testimony. This is a device for taking\r\nan inquiry out of the partisan political atmosphere of a legislative\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the question is often asked whether greater\r\ncongressional freedom in questioning officials of the executive\r\nbranch would not interfere with the efficiency of the government.\r\nMuch of the business of federal government is simply keeping records\r\nand preparing testimony to account for the custodianship of the\r\ngovernment agencies. In most instances it would take an official\r\nfar less time to go before a committee of Congress and give a frank\r\naccount of the activities of his agency than it has taken to devise\r\ncover-ups for frauds, mismanagement, and embarrassing oversights.\r\n\r\nThe Teapot Dome scandals could have been fully disclosed in a few\r\nmonths instead of several years. The details of some of the Truman\r\ntax scandals could have been uncovered in a few weeks. And again, a\r\nfrank accounting could have explained the Dixon-Yates contract in a\r\nmatter of days.\r\n\r\nCongress can be of great service to a cabinet officer in keeping\r\nhis agency clean. If a congressional committee is unreasonable,\r\nor brutal, or oversteps its jurisdiction, such abuses, it must be\r\nremembered, take place in public where they can be seen and remedied.\r\nThe President and others in the executive branch have the personnel\r\nand facilities for pointing out the abuses so they can be eradicated\r\nin the face of public opinion.\r\n\r\nOurs was designed to be a government of laws, and not a government\r\nof men. It was not intended that the President or any other\r\nofficial would have a right to disregard the laws of Congress in\r\naccounting on government activity. The President, it should be\r\npointed out, has all of the protection he needs to prevent Congress\r\nfrom unduly interfering with him in carrying out his executive\r\nresponsibilities. The separation of powers of the three branches of\r\ngovernment is clearly set out in the Constitution, and the only way\r\nthe Constitution has provided for Congress to take action against\r\nthe President is to impeach him. Since no President yet has been\r\nimpeached, this procedure would be resorted to in only the most\r\ndrastic of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, with the vast power and prestige\r\nof his office, has the obligation to set a tone of government that\r\nassures the fullest possible flow of information consistent with\r\nthe nation’s security. He must take the lead in breaking down the\r\narrogance of the bureaucracy that assumes a right to keep the\r\nknowledge of the people’s business from the people themselves, and\r\nthus restore the people’s faith in their governmental servants.\r\n\r\nPresident Kennedy has made an uncertain start. Whether he succeeds\r\ndepends not only on him, but on the press and the public as well. We\r\ncannot afford to allow our faith in a President’s good intentions and\r\nhis own personal integrity to blind us, as we did during President\r\nEisenhower’s administration, to the machinations of the Washington\r\ncover-up. The press, the Congress, the public must make certain\r\nthat Attorney General Kennedy and other key members of the Kennedy\r\nadministration remember how “terribly important” it is that Congress\r\nand the Government Accounting Office maintain full access to the\r\nrecords of government.\r\n\r\nWhen the old secrecy practices are cast aside and the freedom of\r\ninformation guaranteed, then will our democracy flourish as the\r\nfounding fathers intended it should.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\n_Letter from President Eisenhower to the Secretary of Defense_\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n  _May 17, 1954_\r\n\r\n  The Honorable the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,\r\n  _Washington, D. C._\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. SECRETARY: It has long been recognized that to assist the\r\n  Congress in achieving its legislative purposes every Executive\r\n  Department or Agency must, upon the request of a Congressional\r\n  Committee, expeditiously furnish information relating to any matter\r\n  within the jurisdiction of the Committee, with certain historical\r\n  exceptions—some of which are pointed out in the attached memorandum\r\n  from the Attorney General. This Administration has been and will\r\n  continue to be diligent in following this principle. However, it\r\n  is essential to the successful working of our system that the\r\n  persons entrusted with power in any one of the three great branches\r\n  of Government shall not encroach upon the authority confided to\r\n  the others. The ultimate responsibility for the conduct of the\r\n  Executive branch rests with the President.\r\n\r\n  Within this Constitutional framework each branch should co-operate\r\n  fully with each other for the common good. However, throughout our\r\n  history the President has withheld information whenever he found\r\n  that what was sought was confidential or its disclosure would be\r\n  incompatible with the public interest or jeopardize the safety of\r\n  the Nation.\r\n\r\n  Because it is essential to efficient and effective administration\r\n  that employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be\r\n  completely candid in advising with each other on official matters,\r\n  and because it is not in the public interest that any of their\r\n  conversations or communications, or any documents or reproductions,\r\n  concerning such advice be disclosed, you will instruct employees\r\n  of your Department that in all of their appearances before the\r\n  Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Government Operations\r\n  regarding the inquiry now before it they are not to testify to\r\n  any such conversations or communications or to produce any such\r\n  documents or reproductions. This principle must be maintained\r\n  regardless of who would be benefited by such disclosures.\r\n\r\n  I direct this action so as to maintain the proper separation of\r\n  powers between the Executive and Legislative Branches of the\r\n  Government in accordance with my responsibilities and duties under\r\n  the Constitution. This separation is vital to preclude the exercise\r\n  of arbitrary power by any branch of the Government.\r\n\r\n  By this action I am not in any way restricting the testimony of\r\n  such witnesses as to what occurred regarding any matters where\r\n  the communication was directly between any of the principals in\r\n  the controversy within the Executive Branch on the one hand and a\r\n  member of the Subcommittee or its staff on the other.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely,\r\n  DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n  For: the President.\r\n  From: the Attorney General.\r\n\r\n  One of the chief merits of the American system of written\r\n  constitutional law is that all the powers entrusted to the\r\n  government are divided into three great departments, the\r\n  Executive, the Legislative, and the Judicial. It is essential to\r\n  the successful working of this system that the persons entrusted\r\n  with power in any one of these branches shall not be permitted to\r\n  encroach upon the powers confided to the others, but that each\r\n  shall be limited to the exercise of the powers appropriate to its\r\n  own department and no other. The doctrine of separation of powers\r\n  was adopted to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power and to save\r\n  the people from autocracy.\r\n\r\n  This fundamental principle was fully recognized by our first\r\n  President, George Washington, as early as 1796 when he said: “...\r\n  it is essential to the due administration of the Government that\r\n  the boundaries fixed by the Constitution between the different\r\n  departments should be preserved....” In his Farewell Address,\r\n  President Washington again cautioned strongly against the danger\r\n  of encroachment by one department into the domain of another\r\n  as leading to despotism. This principle has received steadfast\r\n  adherence throughout the many years of our history and growth. More\r\n  than ever, it is our duty today to heed these words if our country\r\n  is to retain its place as a leader among the free nations of the\r\n  world.\r\n\r\n  For over 150 years—almost from the time that the American form of\r\n  government was created by the adoption of the Constitution—our\r\n  Presidents have established, by precedent, that they and members\r\n  of their Cabinet and other heads of executive departments have an\r\n  undoubted privilege and discretion to keep confidential, in the\r\n  public interest, papers and information which require secrecy.\r\n  American history abounds in countless illustrations of the refusal,\r\n  on occasion, by the President and heads of departments to furnish\r\n  papers to Congress, or its committees, for reasons of public\r\n  policy. The messages of our past Presidents reveal that almost\r\n  every one of them found it necessary to inform Congress of his\r\n  constitutional duty to execute the office of President, and, in\r\n  furtherance of that duty, to withhold information and papers for\r\n  the public good.\r\n\r\n  Nor are the instances lacking where the aid of a court was sought\r\n  in vain to obtain information or papers from a President and the\r\n  heads of departments. Courts have uniformly held that the President\r\n  and the heads of departments have an uncontrolled discretion to\r\n  withhold the information and papers in the public interest, they\r\n  will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion, and that\r\n  Congress has not the power, as one of the three great branches of\r\n  the Government, to subject the Executive Branch to its will any\r\n  more than the Executive Branch may impose its unrestrained will\r\n  upon the Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT WASHINGTON’S ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n  In March 1792, the House of Representatives passed the following\r\n  resolution:\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, That a committee be appointed to inquire into the\r\n  causes of the failure of the late expedition under Major General\r\n  St. Clair, and that the said committee be empowered to call for\r\n  such persons, papers, and records, as may be necessary to assist\r\n  their inquiries” (3 Annals of Congress, p. 493).\r\n\r\n  This was the first time that a committee of Congress was appointed\r\n  to look into a matter which involved the Executive Branch of the\r\n  Government. The expedition of General St. Clair was under the\r\n  direction of the Secretary of War. The expenditures connected\r\n  therewith came under the Secretary of the Treasury. The House\r\n  based its right to investigate on its control of the expenditures\r\n  of public moneys. It appears that the Secretaries of War and the\r\n  Treasury appeared before the committee. However, when the committee\r\n  was bold enough to ask the President for the papers pertaining\r\n  to the General St. Clair campaign, President Washington called a\r\n  meeting of his Cabinet (Binkley, _President and Congress_, pp.\r\n  40-41).\r\n\r\n  Thomas Jefferson, as Secretary of State, reports what took place at\r\n  that meeting. Besides Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, Henry Knox,\r\n  Secretary of War, and Edmond Randolph, the Attorney General, were\r\n  present. The Committee had first written to Knox for the original\r\n  letters, instructions, etc., to General St. Clair. President\r\n  Washington stated that he had called his Cabinet members together,\r\n  because it was the first example of a demand on the Executive for\r\n  papers, and he wished that so far as it should become a precedent,\r\n  it should be rightly conducted. The President readily admitted that\r\n  he did not doubt the propriety of what the House was doing, but he\r\n  could conceive that there might be papers of so secret a nature\r\n  that they ought not to be given up. Washington and his Cabinet\r\n  came to the unanimous conclusion:\r\n\r\n  “First, that the House was an inquest, and therefore might\r\n  institute inquiries. Second, that it might call for papers\r\n  generally. Third, that the Executive ought to communicate such\r\n  papers as the public good would permit, and ought to refuse those,\r\n  the disclosure of which would injure the public; consequently were\r\n  to exercise a discretion. Fourth, that neither the committee nor\r\n  House had a right to call on the Head of a Department, who and\r\n  whose papers were under the President alone; but that the committee\r\n  should instruct their chairman to move the House to address the\r\n  President.”\r\n\r\n  The precedent thus set by our first President and his Cabinet was\r\n  followed in 1796, when President Washington was presented with a\r\n  resolution of the House of Representatives which requested him to\r\n  lay before the House a copy of the instructions to the Minister of\r\n  the United States who negotiated the treaty with the King of Great\r\n  Britain, together with the correspondence and documents relative to\r\n  that treaty. Apparently it was necessary to implement the treaty\r\n  with an appropriation which the House was called upon to vote. The\r\n  House insisted on its right to the papers requested, as a condition\r\n  to appropriating the required funds (_President and Congress_,\r\n  Wilfred E. Binkley [1947], p. 44).\r\n\r\n  President Washington’s classic reply was, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  “I trust that no part of my conduct has ever indicated a\r\n  disposition to withhold any information which the Constitution has\r\n  enjoined upon the President as a duty to give, or which could be\r\n  required of him by either House of Congress as a right; and with\r\n  truth I affirm that it has been, as it will continue to be while I\r\n  have the honor to preside in the Government, my constant endeavor\r\n  to harmonize with the other branches thereof so far as the trust\r\n  delegated to me by the people of the United States and my sense of\r\n  the obligation it imposes to ‘preserve, protect, and defend the\r\n  Constitution’ will permit” (Richardson, _Messages and Papers of the\r\n  Presidents_, vol. 1, p. 194).\r\n\r\n  Washington then went on to discuss the secrecy required in\r\n  negotiations with foreign governments, and cited that as a reason\r\n  for vesting the power of making treaties in the President, with the\r\n  advice and consent of the Senate. He felt that to admit the House\r\n  of Representatives into the treaty-making power, by reason of its\r\n  constitutional duty to appropriate monies to carry out a treaty,\r\n  would be to establish a dangerous precedent. He closed his message\r\n  to the House as follows:\r\n\r\n  “As, therefore, it is perfectly clear to my understanding that\r\n  the assent of the House of Representatives is not necessary to\r\n  the validity of a treaty; ... and as it is essential to the due\r\n  administration of the Government that the boundaries fixed by the\r\n  Constitution between the different departments should be preserved,\r\n  a just regard to the Constitution and to the duty of my office,\r\n  under all the circumstances of this case, forbids a compliance with\r\n  your request” (Richardson, _Messages and Papers of the Presidents_,\r\n  vol. 1, p. 196).\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT JEFFERSON’S ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n  In January 1807, Representative Randolph introduced a resolution,\r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n  “_Resolved_, That the President of the United States be, and he\r\n  hereby is, requested to lay before this House any information in\r\n  possession of the Executive, except such as he may deem the public\r\n  welfare to require not to be disclosed, touching any illegal\r\n  combination of private individuals against the peace and safety of\r\n  the Union, or any military expedition planned by such individuals\r\n  against the territories of any Power in amity with the United\r\n  States; together with the measures which the Executive has pursued\r\n  and proposes to take for suppressing or defeating the same” (16\r\n  Annals of Congress [1806-1807], p. 336).\r\n\r\n  The resolution was overwhelmingly passed. The Burr conspiracy was\r\n  then stirring the country. Jefferson had made it the object of\r\n  a special message to Congress wherein he referred to a military\r\n  expedition headed by Burr. Jefferson’s reply to the resolution was\r\n  a Message to the Senate and House of Representatives. Jefferson\r\n  brought the Congress up to date on the news which he had been\r\n  receiving concerning the illegal combination of private individuals\r\n  against the peace and safety of the Union. He pointed out that\r\n  he had recently received a mass of data, most of which had been\r\n  obtained without the sanction of an oath so as to constitute formal\r\n  and legal evidence. “It is chiefly in the form of letters, often\r\n  containing such a mixture of rumors, conjectures, and suspicions\r\n  as renders it difficult to sift out the real facts and unadvisable\r\n  to hazard more than general outlines, strengthened by concurrent\r\n  information or the particular credibility of the relator. In\r\n  this state of the evidence, delivered sometimes, too, under the\r\n  restriction of private confidence, neither safety nor justice will\r\n  permit the exposing names, except that of the principal actor,\r\n  whose guilt is placed beyond question” (Richardson, _Messages and\r\n  Papers of the Presidents_, vol. 1, p. 412, dated January 22, 1807).\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMILAR ACTIONS BY PRESIDENTS JACKSON, TYLER, BUCHANAN, AND GRANT\r\n\r\n  On February 10, 1835, President Jackson sent a message to the\r\n  Senate wherein he declined to comply with the Senate’s resolution\r\n  requesting him to communicate copies of charges which had been\r\n  made to the President against the official conduct of Gideon Fitz,\r\n  late Surveyor-General, which caused his removal from office. The\r\n  resolution stated that the information requested was necessary both\r\n  in the action which it proposed to take on the nomination of a\r\n  successor to Fitz, and in connection with the investigation which\r\n  was then in progress by the Senate respecting the frauds in the\r\n  sales of public lands.\r\n\r\n  The President declined to furnish the information. He stated that\r\n  in his judgment the information related to subjects exclusively\r\n  belonging to the executive department. The request therefore\r\n  encroached on the constitutional powers of the executive.\r\n\r\n  The President’s message referred to many previous similar requests,\r\n  which he deemed unconstitutional demands by the Senate:\r\n\r\n  “Their continued repetition imposes on me, as the representative\r\n  and trustee of the American people, the painful but imperious duty\r\n  of resisting to the utmost any further encroachment on the rights\r\n  of the Executive” (ibid., p. 133).\r\n\r\n  The President next took up the fact that the Senate resolution\r\n  had been passed in executive session, from which he was bound\r\n  to presume that if the information requested by the resolution\r\n  were communicated, it would be applied in secret session to the\r\n  investigation of frauds in the sales of public lands. The President\r\n  said that, if he were to furnish the information, the citizen whose\r\n  conduct the Senate sought to impeach would lose one of his basic\r\n  rights, namely—that of a public investigation in the presence\r\n  of his accusers and of the witnesses against him. In addition,\r\n  compliance with the resolution would subject the motives of the\r\n  President, in the case of Mr. Fitz, to the review of the Senate\r\n  when not sitting as judges on an impeachment; and even if such\r\n  a consequence did not follow in the present case, the President\r\n  feared that compliance by the Executive might thereafter be quoted\r\n  as a precedent for similar and repeated applications.\r\n\r\n  “Such a result, if acquiesced in, would ultimately subject the\r\n  independent constitutional action of the Executive in a matter of\r\n  great national concernment to the domination and control of the\r\n  Senate;...\r\n\r\n  “I therefore decline a compliance with so much of the resolution of\r\n  the Senate as requests ‘copies of the charges, if any,’ in relation\r\n  to Mr. Fitz, and in doing so must be distinctly understood as\r\n  neither affirming nor denying that any such charges were made ...”\r\n  (ibid., p. 134).\r\n\r\n  One of the best reasoned precedents of a President’s refusal\r\n  to permit the head of a department to disclose confidential\r\n  information to the House of Representatives is President Tyler’s\r\n  refusal to communicate to the House of Representatives the reports\r\n  relative to the affairs of the Cherokee Indians and to the frauds\r\n  which were alleged to have been practiced upon them. A resolution\r\n  of the House of Representatives had called upon the Secretary of\r\n  War to communicate to the House the reports made to the Department\r\n  of War by Lieutenant Colonel Hitchcock relative to the affairs of\r\n  the Cherokee Indians together with all information communicated by\r\n  him concerning the frauds he was charged to investigate; also all\r\n  facts in the possession of the Executive relating to the subject.\r\n  The Secretary of War consulted with the President and under the\r\n  latter’s direction informed the House that negotiations were then\r\n  pending with the Indians for settlement of their claims; in the\r\n  opinion of the President and the Department, therefore, publication\r\n  of the report at that time would be inconsistent with the public\r\n  interest. The Secretary of War further stated in his answer to\r\n  the resolution that the report sought by the House, dealing with\r\n  alleged frauds which Lieutenant Colonel Hitchcock was charged to\r\n  investigate, contained information which was obtained by Colonel\r\n  Hitchcock by ex parte inquiries of persons whose statements were\r\n  without the sanction of an oath, and which the persons implicated\r\n  had had no opportunity to contradict or explain. The Secretary\r\n  of War expressed the opinion that to promulgate those statements\r\n  at that time would be grossly unjust to those persons, and would\r\n  defeat the object of the inquiry. He also remarked that the\r\n  Department had not been given at that time sufficient opportunity\r\n  to pursue the investigation, to call the parties affected for\r\n  explanations, or to determine on the measures proper to be taken.\r\n\r\n  The answer of the Secretary of War was not satisfactory to the\r\n  Committee on Indian Affairs of the House, which claimed the\r\n  right to demand from the Executive and heads of departments such\r\n  information as may be in their possession relating to subjects of\r\n  the deliberations of the House.\r\n\r\n  President Tyler in a message dated January 31, 1843, vigorously\r\n  asserted that the House of Representatives could not exercise a\r\n  right to call upon the Executive for information, even though it\r\n  related to a subject of the deliberations of the House, if, by\r\n  so doing, it attempted to interfere with the discretion of the\r\n  Executive.\r\n\r\n  The same course of action was taken by President James Buchanan in\r\n  1860 in resisting a resolution of the House to investigate whether\r\n  the President or any other officer of the Government had, by money,\r\n  patronage, or other improper means sought to influence the action\r\n  of Congress for or against the passage of any law relating to the\r\n  rights of any state or territory. (See Richardson, _Messages and\r\n  Papers of the Presidents_, vol. 5, pp. 618-19.)\r\n\r\n  In the administration of President Ulysses S. Grant the House\r\n  requested the President to inform it whether any executive offices,\r\n  acts, or duties, and if any, what, have been performed at a\r\n  distance from the seat of government established by law. It appears\r\n  that the purpose of this inquiry was to embarrass the President by\r\n  reason of his having spent some of the hot months at Long Branch.\r\n  President Grant replied that he failed to find in the Constitution\r\n  the authority given to the House of Representatives, and that the\r\n  inquiry had nothing to do with legislation (Richardson, _Messages\r\n  and Papers of the Presidents_, vol. 7, pp. 362-63).\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT CLEVELAND’S ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n  In 1886, during President Cleveland’s administration, there\r\n  was an extended discussion in the Senate with reference to its\r\n  relations to the Executive caused by the refusal of the Attorney\r\n  General to transmit to the Senate certain documents concerning\r\n  the administration of the Office of the District Attorney for the\r\n  Southern District of South Alabama, and suspension of George W.\r\n  Durkin, the late incumbent. The majority of the Senate Committee\r\n  on the Judiciary concluded that it was entitled to know all\r\n  that officially exists or takes place in any of the departments\r\n  of Government and that neither the President nor the head of\r\n  a department could withhold official facts and information as\r\n  distinguished from private and unofficial papers.\r\n\r\n  In his reply President Cleveland disclaimed any intention to\r\n  withhold official papers, but he denied that papers and documents\r\n  inherently private or confidential, addressed to the President or a\r\n  head of a department, having reference to an act entirely executive\r\n  such as the suspension of an official, were changed in their nature\r\n  and became official when placed for convenience in the custody\r\n  of a public department. (Richardson, _Messages and Papers of the\r\n  Presidents_, vol. 8, pp. 378-79, 381.)\r\n\r\n  Challenging the attitude that because the executive departments\r\n  were created by Congress the latter had any supervisory power\r\n  over them, President Cleveland declared (Eberling, _Congressional\r\n  Investigation_, p. 258):\r\n\r\n  “I do not suppose that the public offices of the United States\r\n  are regulated or controlled in their relations to either House of\r\n  Congress by the fact that they were created by laws enacted by\r\n  themselves. It must be that these instrumentalities were created\r\n  for the benefit of the people and to answer the general purposes\r\n  of government under the Constitution and the laws, and that they\r\n  are unencumbered by any lien in favor of either branch of Congress\r\n  growing out of their construction, and unembarrassed by any\r\n  obligation to the Senate as the price of their creation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT’S ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n  In 1909, during the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt,\r\n  the question of the right of the President to exercise complete\r\n  direction and control over heads of executive departments was\r\n  raised again. At that time the Senate passed a resolution\r\n  directing the Attorney General to inform the Senate whether certain\r\n  legal proceedings had been instituted against the United States\r\n  Steel Corporation, and if not, the reasons for its nonaction.\r\n  Request was also made for any opinion of the Attorney General, if\r\n  one was written. President Theodore Roosevelt replied refusing to\r\n  honor this request upon the ground that “Heads of the Executive\r\n  Departments are subject to the Constitution, and to the laws passed\r\n  by the Congress in pursuance of the Constitution, and to the\r\n  directions of the President of the United States, but to no other\r\n  direction whatever” (_Congressional Record_, vol. 43, pt. 1, 60th\r\n  Cong., 2d sess., pp. 527-28).\r\n\r\n  When the Senate was unable to get the documents from the Attorney\r\n  General, it summoned Herbert K. Smith, the Head of the Bureau of\r\n  Corporations, and requested the papers and documents on penalty\r\n  of imprisonment for contempt. Mr. Smith reported the request to\r\n  the President, who directed him to turn over to the President\r\n  all the papers in the case “so that I could assist the Senate in\r\n  the prosecution of its investigation.” President Roosevelt then\r\n  informed Senator Clark of the Judiciary Committee what had been\r\n  done, that he had the papers and the only way the Senate could\r\n  get them was through his impeachment. President Roosevelt also\r\n  explained that some of the facts were given to the Government under\r\n  the seal of secrecy and cannot be divulged, “and I will see to it\r\n  that the word of this Government to the individual is kept sacred.”\r\n  (Corwin, _The President: Office and Powers_, pp. 281, 428; Abbott,\r\n  _The Letters of Archie Butt, Personal Aid to President Roosevelt_,\r\n  pp. 305-6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT COOLIDGE’S ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nIn 1924, during the administration of President Coolidge, the latter\r\nobjected to the action of a special investigating committee appointed\r\nby the Senate to investigate the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Request\r\nwas made by the committee for a list of the companies in which the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury was alleged to be interested for the\r\npurpose of investigating their tax returns. Calling this exercise of\r\npower an unwarranted intrusion, President Coolidge said:\r\n\r\n“Whatever may be necessary for the information of the Senate or any\r\nof its committees in order to better enable them to perform their\r\nlegislative or other constitutional functions ought always to be\r\nfurnished willingly and expeditiously by any department. But it is\r\nrecognized both by law and custom that there is certain confidential\r\ninformation which it would be detrimental to the public service to\r\nreveal” (68th Cong., 1st sess., _Record_, April 11, 1924, p. 6087).\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT HOOVER’S ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n  A similar question arose in 1930 during the administration of\r\n  President Hoover. Secretary of State Stimson refused to disclose\r\n  to the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee certain\r\n  confidential telegrams and letters leading up to the London\r\n  Conference and the London Treaty. The Committee asserted its\r\n  right to have full and free access to all records touching the\r\n  negotiations of the treaty, basing its right on the constitutional\r\n  prerogative of the Senate in the treaty-making process. In his\r\n  message to the Senate, President Hoover pointed out that there were\r\n  a great many informal statements and reports which were given to\r\n  the Government in confidence. The Executive was under a duty, in\r\n  order to maintain amicable relations with other nations, not to\r\n  publicize all the negotiations and statements which went into the\r\n  making of the treaty. He further declared that the Executive must\r\n  not be guilty of a breach of trust, nor violate the invariable\r\n  practice of nations. “In view of this, I believe that to further\r\n  comply with the above resolution would be incompatible with the\r\n  public interest” (S. Doc. No. 216, 71st Cong., special sess., p. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT’S ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n  The position was followed during the administration of President\r\n  Franklin D. Roosevelt. There were many instances in which the\r\n  President and his Executive heads refused to make available certain\r\n  information to Congress the disclosure of which was deemed to be\r\n  confidential or contrary to the public interest. Merely a few need\r\n  be cited.\r\n\r\n  1. Federal Bureau of Investigation records and reports were refused\r\n  to congressional committees, in the public interest (40 Op. A. G.\r\n  No. 8, April 30, 1941).\r\n\r\n  2. The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation refused to\r\n  give testimony or to exhibit a copy of the President’s directive\r\n  requiring him, in the interests of national security, to refrain\r\n  from testifying or from disclosing the contents of the Bureau’s\r\n  reports and activities. (_Hearings_, vol. 2, House, 78th Cong.\r\n  Select Committee to Investigate the Federal Communications\r\n  Commission, 1944, p. 2337.)\r\n\r\n  3. Communications between the President and the heads of\r\n  departments were held to be confidential and privileged and not\r\n  subject to inquiry by a committee of one of the Houses of Congress.\r\n  (Letter dated January 22, 1944, signed Francis Biddle, Attorney\r\n  General to Select Committee, etc.)\r\n\r\n  4. The Director of the Bureau of the Budget refused to testify and\r\n  to produce the Bureau’s files, pursuant to subpoena which had been\r\n  served upon him, because the President had instructed him not to\r\n  make public the records of the Bureau due to their confidential\r\n  nature. Public interest was again invoked to prevent disclosure.\r\n  (Reliance placed on Attorney General’s Opinion in 40 Op. A. G. No.\r\n  8, April 30, 1941.)\r\n\r\n  5. The Secretaries of War and Navy were directed not to deliver\r\n  documents which the committee had requested, on grounds of\r\n  public interest. The Secretaries, in their own judgment, refused\r\n  permission to Army and Navy officers to appear and testify because\r\n  they felt that it would be contrary to the public interests.\r\n  (_Hearings_, Select Committee to Investigate the Federal\r\n  Communications Commission, vol. 1, pp. 46, 48-68.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT TRUMAN’S ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n  During the Truman administration also the President adhered to\r\n  the traditional Executive view that the President’s discretion\r\n  must govern the surrender of Executive files. Some of the major\r\n  incidents during the administration of President Truman in which\r\n  information, records, and files were denied to Congressional\r\n  Committees were as follows:\r\n\r\n      Date                     Type of Document Refused\r\n\r\n  Mar. 4, 1948    FBI letter-report on Dr. Condon, Director of National\r\n                    Bureau of Standards, refused by Secretary of\r\n                    Commerce.\r\n\r\n  Mar. 15, 1948   President issued directive forbidding all Executive\r\n                    departments and agencies to furnish information or\r\n                    reports concerning loyalty of their employees to\r\n                    any court or committee of Congress, unless\r\n                    President approves.\r\n\r\n  March 1948      Dr. John R. Steelman, Confidential Adviser to the\r\n                    President, refused to appear before Committee on\r\n                    Education and Labor of the House, following the\r\n                    service of two subpoenas upon him. President\r\n                    directed him not to appear.\r\n\r\n  Aug. 5, 1948    Attorney General wrote Senator Ferguson, Chairman\r\n                    of Senate Investigations Subcommittee, that he\r\n                    would not furnish letters, memoranda, and other\r\n                    notices which the Justice Department had furnished\r\n                    to other government agencies concerning W. W.\r\n                    Remington.\r\n\r\n  Feb. 22, 1950   Senate Res. 231 directing Senate Subcommittee to\r\n                    procure State Department loyalty files was met with\r\n                    President Truman’s refusal, following vigorous\r\n                    opposition of J. Edgar Hoover.\r\n\r\n  Mar. 27, 1950    Attorney General and Director of FBI appeared before\r\n                     Senate Subcommittee. Mr. Hoovers historic statement\r\n                     of reasons for refusing to furnish raw files\r\n                     approved by Attorney General.\r\n\r\n  May 16, 1951     General Bradley refused to divulge conversations\r\n                     between President and his advisers to combined\r\n                     Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services\r\n                     Committees.\r\n\r\n  Jan. 31, 1952    President Truman directed Secretary of State to\r\n                     refuse to Senate Internal Security Subcommittee\r\n                     the reports and views of foreign service officers.\r\n\r\n  Apr. 22, 1952     Acting Attorney General Perlman laid down procedure\r\n                     for complying with requests for inspection of\r\n                     Department of Justice files by Committee on\r\n                     Judiciary:\r\n\r\n                         Requests on open cases would not be honored.\r\n                       Status report will be furnished.\r\n\r\n                         As to closed cases, files would be made\r\n                       available. All FBI reports and confidential\r\n                       information would not be made available.\r\n\r\n                         As to personnel files, they are never\r\n                       disclosed.\r\n\r\n  Apr. 3, 1952     President Truman instructed Secretary of State to\r\n                     withhold from Senate Appropriations Subcommittee\r\n                     files on loyalty and security investigations of\r\n                     employees—policy to apply to all Executive\r\n                     agencies. The names of individuals determined to\r\n                     be security risks would not be divulged. The voting\r\n                     record of members of an agency loyalty board would\r\n                     not be divulged.\r\n\r\n  Thus, you can see that the Presidents of the United States have\r\n  withheld information of Executive departments or agencies whenever\r\n  it was found that the information sought was confidential or that\r\n  its disclosure would be incompatible with the public interest or\r\n  jeopardize the safety of the Nation. The courts too have held that\r\n  the question whether the production of the papers was contrary to\r\n  the public interest was a matter for the Executive to determine.\r\n\r\n  By keeping the lines which separate and divide the three great\r\n  branches of our Government clearly defined, no one branch has been\r\n  able to encroach upon the powers of the other.\r\n\r\n  Upon this firm principle our country’s strength, liberty, and\r\n  democratic form of government will continue to endure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B\r\n\r\n_Letters Regarding the Presidential Letter of May 17, 1954_\r\n\r\n\r\n  _October 9, 1956_\r\n\r\n  Hon. DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER,\r\n  _The President of the United States,\r\n  The White House, Washington, D.C._\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: At your press conference on Thursday, September\r\n  27, 1956, you were asked whether your letter of May 17, 1954,\r\n  to Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson was being misused as\r\n  authority to restrict information from the public.\r\n\r\n  This question was posed by Mr. Clark Mollenhoff of the Des Moines\r\n  Register and Tribune.\r\n\r\n  You stated that if Mr. Mollenhoff would put the question in\r\n  writing—which I understand he has done—it will be answered.\r\n\r\n  This particular letter and its misuse by a number of Federal\r\n  departments and agencies has been a great concern to the Special\r\n  Subcommittee on Government Information. Although the letter, and\r\n  the accompanying memorandum from the Attorney General, granted\r\n  authority to one particular agency to refuse information to a\r\n  specific committee of Congress in a single instance, 19 departments\r\n  and agencies have cited the letter as authority to refuse\r\n  information to the public or the Congress.\r\n\r\n  This occurred in agency answers to the subcommittee’s questionnaire\r\n  of November 7, 1955, on information practices and policies as well\r\n  as during subcommittee hearings with executive officials.\r\n\r\n  Enclosed is an intermediate report, adopted unanimously by the\r\n  House Government Operations Committee, on the subcommittee’s study\r\n  of restrictions on information. The problem of misuse of the May\r\n  17, 1954, letter is discussed on page 90 and at other points.\r\n\r\n  When the answer to Mr. Mollenhoff’s question has been prepared and\r\n  transmitted to him, the subcommittee would appreciate receiving\r\n  copies of it and any other comments you have on the matter.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully,\r\n  JOHN E. MOSS, _Chairman_\r\n  THE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n  _Washington, October 17, 1956_.\r\n\r\n  Hon. JOHN E. MOSS,\r\n  _House of Representatives, Washington, D.C._\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. MOSS: This will acknowledge your October 9 letter to the\r\n  President asking that you be supplied with copies of the answer\r\n  to a question submitted by Mr. Clark Mollenhoff of the Des Moines\r\n  Register and Tribune.\r\n\r\n  The answer to this question has not yet been given. However, as\r\n  soon as it is, we will get in touch with you.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely,\r\n  GERALD D. MORGAN,\r\n  _Special Counsel to the President_\r\n\r\n  _October 26, 1956_\r\n\r\n  Mr. CLARK R. MOLLENHOFF,\r\n  _Des Moines Register and Tribune,\r\n  National Press Building, Washington, D.C._\r\n\r\n  DEAR CLARK: At the press conference on September 27, 1956,\r\n  you asked the President whether “all employees of the Federal\r\n  Government, at their own discretion, can determine whether they\r\n  will testify or will not testify before congressional committees\r\n  when there is no security problem involved.”\r\n\r\n  In the President’s letter of May 17, 1954, to Secretary Wilson,\r\n  the President set forth the general principles that are to govern\r\n  all employees in the executive branch concerning their testimony,\r\n  or the production of documents, relating to their conversations or\r\n  communications with, or their advice to, each other on official\r\n  matters. In his press conference of July 6, 1955, the President\r\n  further amplified the principles set forth in this letter as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n  “If anybody in an official position of this Government does\r\n  anything which is an official act, and submits it either in the\r\n  form of recommendation or anything else, that is properly a matter\r\n  for investigation if Congress so chooses, provided the national\r\n  security is not involved.\r\n\r\n  “But when it comes to the conversations that take place between\r\n  any responsible official and his advisers, or exchange of mere\r\n  little slips, of this or that, expressing personal opinions on the\r\n  most confidential basis, those are not subject to investigation by\r\n  anybody. And if they are it will wreck the Government.”\r\n\r\n  In so writing to Secretary Wilson, and in further amplifying these\r\n  principles, the President was exercising a right, which is his, and\r\n  his alone, to determine what action is necessary to maintain the\r\n  proper separation of powers between the executive and legislative\r\n  branches of the Government. In the orderly administration of the\r\n  Government, the head of each executive agency directs the manner\r\n  in which these principles are enforced.\r\n\r\n  The underlying reasons for these principles are set forth in the\r\n  President’s letter of May 17, 1954. It is essential to efficient\r\n  and effective administration that employees of the executive branch\r\n  be in a position to be completely candid in advising each other on\r\n  official matters. It is essential, if channels of information are\r\n  to be kept open, that confidences among employees should not be\r\n  breached.\r\n\r\n  It will continue to be this administration’s policy to keep the\r\n  Congress and the people fully informed of what is being done in\r\n  the executive branch. An employee is not free merely to exercise\r\n  his own discretion but in the final analysis information will be\r\n  withheld only when the President or agency heads acting under the\r\n  President’s authority or instruction determine it is contrary to\r\n  the public interest to disclose it.\r\n\r\n  All of the above, of course, is subject to the Executive order\r\n  dealing with the classification of information in the interest\r\n  of security, and to the various statutes and regulations of the\r\n  department and agencies relating to information to be held in\r\n  confidence.\r\n\r\n  I hope this answers your inquiry.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely,\r\n  GERALD D. MORGAN,\r\n  _Special Counsel to the President_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\n_Correspondence on the Right of Access to Information by the General\r\nAccounting Office_\r\n\r\n\r\n  _November 12, 1958_\r\n\r\n  Hon. DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER,\r\n  _President of the United States,\r\n  Washington, D.C._\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I just returned to Washington for a hearing\r\n  of the Government Information Subcommittee. The subcommittee, I\r\n  understand, will inquire into the matter of General Accounting\r\n  Office access to Air Force Inspector General’s reports. In that\r\n  context, my attention has been directed to your press conference\r\n  comments of November 5, and to some newspaper speculation about\r\n  those comments.\r\n\r\n  The text of your remarks to which I refer is as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Q. (Clark R. Mollenhoff, Des Moines Register). Mr. President, you\r\n  have mentioned the spending in the Defense Department here as one\r\n  of the important issues, and the General Accounting Office, which\r\n  is the watchdog on frauds and extravagance in the various agencies,\r\n  has been barred from reports over in the Air Force and the Defense\r\n  Department generally, and on this they claim that they have\r\n  authority from you to withhold reports any time it is ‘inexpedient\r\n  to do so.’\r\n\r\n  “I wonder if you have given that authority and if you feel that\r\n  the GAO should have a full rein to go in and investigate all\r\n  indications of fraud and extravagance.\r\n\r\n  “The PRESIDENT. You are obviously talking about some special thing\r\n  that I would have to study before I could make—give an answer.\r\n\r\n  “I have stated this time and again: I believe that every\r\n  investigating committee of the Congress, every auditing office,\r\n  like the GAO, should always have an opportunity to see official\r\n  records if the security of our country is not involved.\r\n\r\n  “Q. (Clark R. Mollenhoff, Des Moines Register). Well, they claim\r\n  this, Mr. President, under executive privilege.\r\n\r\n  “The PRESIDENT. No, that’s all I have to say—I told you that is all\r\n  I had to say for the moment.”\r\n\r\n  While this question-and-answer exchange did not identify Inspector\r\n  General reports, and while you did preface your comment by saying\r\n  this obviously referred to some special thing you would have to\r\n  study before giving an answer, I would nevertheless like to ask\r\n  this: Did you mean to imply by your comments that the complete text\r\n  of Inspector General reports, including recommendations, be made\r\n  available to Congress and the General Accounting Office?\r\n\r\n  Respectfully,\r\n  CLARE E. HOFFMAN\r\n\r\n  THE WHITE HOUSE,\r\n  _Washington, November 12, 1958._\r\n\r\n  Hon. CLARE E. HOFFMAN,\r\n  _House of Representatives, Washington, D.C._\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. HOFFMAN: Thank you for your letter inquiring about\r\n  comments in my November 5 press conference.\r\n\r\n  I believe, of course, that the public, the Congress, and such\r\n  auditing units as the General Accounting Office should have\r\n  all the information departments and agencies can properly make\r\n  available. However, the public interest also demands order and\r\n  efficiency in the operation of these departments and agencies.\r\n  And in my judgment the public interest is not necessarily served\r\n  by divulging the advice, suggestions, or recommendations which\r\n  subordinate employees periodically make to their superiors. In this\r\n  connection, recommendations of inspectors general have been a most\r\n  useful advisory tool in administering the military departments;\r\n  and historically, recommendations and other advisory matter in\r\n  such reports have not been released. I think this practice is a\r\n  correct one, and is in the best interest of the Nation. At the\r\n  same time, I want to add that the facts are distinct from advice\r\n  and recommendations in these reports. It is my understanding that\r\n  all the facts developed in the inspector general’s report to which\r\n  you refer are being made available at the request of the General\r\n  Accounting Office.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely,\r\n  DWIGHT D.

Section 313\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n  “_All departments and establishments shall furnish to the\r\n  Comptroller General such information_ regarding the powers, duties,\r\n  activities, organization, financial transactions, and methods of\r\n  business of their respective offices _as he may_ from time to time\r\n  _require of them_; and the Comptroller General, or any of his\r\n  assistants or employees, when duly authorized by him, shall, for\r\n  the purpose of securing such information, have access to and the\r\n  right to examine _any_ books, documents, papers, or records of\r\n  _any_ such department or establishment. The authority contained in\r\n  this section shall not be applicable to expenditures made under the\r\n  provisions of section 291 of the Revised Statutes.”\r\n\r\n  It will be noted that the only exception in section 313 relates to\r\n  expenditures made under section 291, Revised Statutes (31 U.S.C.\r\n  107), which authorizes the Secretary of State to account for\r\n  certain confidential expenditures in connection with intercourse\r\n  or treaties with foreign nations by certificate where, in his\r\n  judgment, he may think it advisable not to specify the details\r\n  of such expenditure. Since that is the only exception stated and\r\n  following the legal maxim that the specific setting forth of one\r\n  type of exception precludes others from arising, it seems clear\r\n  that the Comptroller General may require, and the departments are\r\n  required to furnish, documents, etc., as to any other transaction\r\n  or activity. Also, the language of section 313 itself [except as\r\n  to the expenditures under 291 R. S.] in requiring the departments\r\n  to furnish such information as the Comptroller General “may\r\n  require of them” and its requirement that he be _given access to\r\n  any_ documents of the departments, clearly gives him access to\r\n  _all_ such documentation. If he has access to _any_ document, he\r\n  has access to _all_. The legislative background of the Budget and\r\n  Accounting Act, 1921, makes no qualification as to what records\r\n  can be required; the provision itself apparently being considered\r\n  sufficiently specific. The legislative reports do bring out that\r\n  one of the principal functions of the Comptroller General is to\r\n  enable the Congress to be kept advised as to expenditures of\r\n  the Government, and that the Comptroller General is expected to\r\n  criticize extravagance, duplication, and inefficiency in executive\r\n  departments. There is no doubt, in passing the act, the Congress\r\n  did not intend that the executive agencies could, or would,\r\n  withhold any books, documents, papers, or records needed by the\r\n  Comptroller General. Otherwise, the very purpose of the act would\r\n  be nullified.\r\n\r\n  The authority and duty of the Comptroller General was amplified\r\n  by section 206 of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (31\r\n  U.S.C. 60), which authorized and directed him to make expenditure\r\n  analyses of each agency in the executive branch of the Government\r\n  which “will enable Congress to determine whether public funds have\r\n  been economically and efficiently administered and expended” and\r\n  to make reports thereon from time to time to the Committees on\r\n  Government Operations, and Appropriations and other committees\r\n  having jurisdiction over legislation relating to the operation\r\n  of the agencies involved. The work of the Comptroller General,\r\n  together with the activities of the Committees on Government\r\n  Operations, were to serve as a check on the economy and efficiency\r\n  of administrative management. See pages 6 and 7, Senate Report No.\r\n  1400 on the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946.\r\n\r\n  The Congress has also directed that the Comptroller General in\r\n  performing his duties give full consideration to the administrative\r\n  reports and controls of the departments and agencies. The\r\n  Government Corporation Control Act specifically provides in\r\n  section 301 (a) (31 U.S.C. 866), “That in making the audits ...\r\n  the Comptroller General shall, to the fullest extent deemed by him\r\n  to be practicable, utilize reports of examination of Government\r\n  corporations made by a supervising administrative agency pursuant\r\n  to law.” The legislative reports on that act, Senate Report 694,\r\n  page 10, contains the following significant language:\r\n\r\n  “The audit provisions are intended to give the Congress the\r\n  independent audit reports of its agent, the Comptroller General,\r\n  as to the operations and financial condition of every Government\r\n  corporation in which the Government has a capital interest.... If\r\n  the audit by the Comptroller General is to be a truly independent\r\n  audit, he must not be restricted in such a way as to prevent\r\n  him from examining into and reporting the transactions of any\r\n  Government corporation to the extent deemed by him to be necessary.\r\n\r\n  “The Comptroller General has stated that in making his audits he\r\n  will give full consideration to the effectiveness of the existing\r\n  systems of internal accounts, procedures, and controls and of\r\n  external examinations by an administrative supervisory agency.\r\n  The bill includes a specific provision requiring the Comptroller\r\n  General in making his audits to utilize, to the fullest extent\r\n  deemed by him to be practicable, reports of examinations of\r\n  Government corporations by a supervising administrative agency\r\n  pursuant to law.”\r\n\r\n  The Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 requires each\r\n  executive agency to maintain systems of accounting and internal\r\n  control and provides, in section 117 (a) (31 U.S.C. 67 [a]), that\r\n  the Comptroller General in determining auditing procedures and\r\n  the extent of examination to be given accounts and vouchers give\r\n  consideration to “the effectiveness of accounting organizations and\r\n  systems, internal audit and control, and related administrative\r\n  practices of the respective agencies.”\r\n\r\n  The Comptroller General is required to audit the activities of the\r\n  executive departments and agencies; to make expenditure analyses\r\n  to determine whether funds have economically been expended; and to\r\n  give consideration to the departments’ internal audit and control\r\n  and related administrative practices. To perform these duties he is\r\n  given the clear statutory authority to require information of the\r\n  departments and agencies regarding their organization, activities,\r\n  and methods of business, coupled with the right to access to _any_\r\n  books, documents, papers, or records of any such establishment\r\n  (except as to the confidential State Department funds).\r\n\r\n  There have been no court cases construing the statutes giving\r\n  the Comptroller General access to records. However, in 1925, the\r\n  Attorney General in an opinion to the Secretary of War (34 Op.\r\n  Atty. Gen. 446), concerning a request by the Comptroller General\r\n  for information relative to an award of a contract showing that\r\n  the lowest bid was accepted, or if otherwise, a statement for the\r\n  reasons for accepting other than the lowest bid, advised, in part,\r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n  “It will be observed that the Comptroller General states that this\r\n  requirement is made necessary in order that a satisfactory audit\r\n  may be made. What papers or data he should have to make such an\r\n  audit would seem to be a matter solely for his determination.\r\n  Moreover, section 313 of the Budget and Accounting Act provides (p.\r\n  26):\r\n\r\n  “All departments and establishments shall furnish to the\r\n  Comptroller General such information regarding the powers, duties,\r\n  activities, organization, financial transactions, and methods\r\n  of business of their respective offices as he may from time to\r\n  time require of them; and the Comptroller General, or any of his\r\n  assistants or employees, when duly authorized by him, shall, for\r\n  the purpose of securing such information, have access to and the\r\n  right to examine any books, documents, papers, or records of any\r\n  such department or establishment....”\r\n\r\n  Questions as to whether the General Accounting Office has a right\r\n  to access to records claimed to be confidential for security\r\n  or other reasons have arisen from time to time and the General\r\n  Accounting Office has always taken the position that it has the\r\n  right to the information, even though certain provisions of law\r\n  relating to disclosure might be applicable to it.\r\n\r\n  The General Accounting Office recognizes that certain of the\r\n  functions of the inspectors general, such as criminal and personnel\r\n  investigations, are of a confidential nature and it will normally\r\n  accept summaries of facts contained in such reports to the\r\n  extent they are needed in connection with its work. However, the\r\n  inspectors general also have as a part of their respective missions\r\n  and duties responsibility for conducting inspections, surveys,\r\n  and examinations of the effectiveness of operations and overall\r\n  efficiency of a command, installation, or activity. These functions\r\n  may be performed on a periodic or special basis as directed by\r\n  competent authority. The performance of these functions constitutes\r\n  an important part of the process of management evaluations and\r\n  internal reviews as distinguished from criminal or personnel\r\n  investigations. They provide officials and appropriate personnel\r\n  of authority with an independent appraisal of the effectiveness of\r\n  operations and overall efficiency. Moreover, a very considerable\r\n  part of the inspections and reviews made by the inspectors general\r\n  involve reviews of procedures and policies and as such are an\r\n  important segment of the internal reviews and control which the\r\n  General Accounting Office, under section 117 (a) of the Budget\r\n  and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 is required to consider and\r\n  recognize in determining the audit procedures to be followed in its\r\n  reviews.\r\n\r\n  The scope of inspection and survey programs of the inspectors\r\n  general is similar in character to much of the work the General\r\n  Accounting Office has scheduled in requirements, procurement,\r\n  supply management, and research and development areas. The\r\n  programs of the Deputy Inspector General for Inspection of the\r\n  Air Force covering the period July 1, to December 31, 1958,\r\n  include (1) a survey of Air Force procurement methods (advertising\r\n  versus negotiation); (2) a survey of procurement quantitative\r\n  and qualitative program changes; (3) a survey of procurement of\r\n  commercial communications and utility services; (4) a survey of\r\n  contract cost overruns; (5) a survey of maintenance programs;\r\n  (6) a survey of modification programs; (7) a survey of the\r\n  application of electronic data processing systems and other like\r\n  subjects. All of these subjects represent internal and management\r\n  evaluations which would clearly be a part of “internal audit and\r\n  control” within the meaning of section 117 (a) of the Accounting\r\n  and Auditing Act of 1950. It is essential that such reports be made\r\n  available to the General Accounting Office in order that it can\r\n  evaluate the effectiveness of the department’s system of internal\r\n  control and to preclude unwarranted and unnecessary duplication\r\n  of effort in the internal audit and the independent review made\r\n  by this Office. The Air Force Inspector General’s report on the\r\n  ballistic missiles program clearly falls within the term “internal\r\n  audit and control.”\r\n\r\n  The Secretary of the Air Force in refusing the Comptroller General\r\n  access to the Inspector General’s report on the ballistic missiles\r\n  program stated that the Inspector General’s reports are prepared\r\n  solely for the use of responsible officials within the Air Force,\r\n  and that the objective of self-criticism can be obtained only if\r\n  the Inspector General’s organization has the assurance that its\r\n  reports will, without exception, be kept within the Department.\r\n  The Secretary also stated that the report in question concerned\r\n  the internal management of the Department, and was prepared solely\r\n  for the benefit and use of those officers and employees of the\r\n  Department who are responsible for its administration, and that\r\n  the release of such reports to persons outside the Department\r\n  would have a serious effect on the effective administration of\r\n  the Department. The Secretary concluded that these considerations\r\n  compelled him to conclude that the public interest would best be\r\n  served by not releasing the report.\r\n\r\n  It is our understanding that the position of the Secretary is\r\n  premised on paragraph 151 (b) (3) of the Manual for Courts Martial\r\n  (1951) which was prescribed by the President on February 8, 1951,\r\n  through Executive Order 10214, pursuant to the act of May 5,\r\n  1950 (64 Stat. 107), and on the general basis that the heads of\r\n  executive departments have the right to withhold information or\r\n  papers which they deem confidential, in the public interest.\r\n\r\n  The Manual for Courts Martial, 1951, Executive Order 10214, dated\r\n  February 8, 1951, was issued pursuant to article 36 of the act of\r\n  May 5, 1950 (64 Stat. 120). Article 36 (a) provides:\r\n\r\n  “The procedure, including modes of proof, in cases before\r\n  courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military commissions, and\r\n  other military tribunals may be prescribed by the President by\r\n  regulations which shall, so far as he deems practicable, apply the\r\n  principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in\r\n  the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,\r\n  but which shall not be contrary or inconsistent with this code.”\r\n\r\n  Article 151 (b) (3) of the Manual for Courts Martial provides:\r\n\r\n  “The Inspectors General of the various armed forces, and their\r\n  assistants, are confidential agents of the Secretaries of the\r\n  military or executive departments concerned, or of the military\r\n  commander on whose staff they may be serving. Their investigations\r\n  are privileged unless a different procedure is prescribed by\r\n  the authority ordering the investigation. Reports of such\r\n  investigations and their accompanying testimony and exhibits are\r\n  likewise privileged, and there is no authority of law or practice\r\n  requiring that copies thereof be furnished to any person other than\r\n  the authority ordering the investigation or superior authority.\r\n  However, when application is made to the authority by court-martial\r\n  certain testimony, or an exhibit, accompanying a report of\r\n  investigation, which testimony or exhibit has become material\r\n  in a trial (to show an inconsistent statement of a witness, for\r\n  example), he should ordinarily approve such application unless the\r\n  testimony or exhibit requested contains a state secret or unless\r\n  in the exercise of a sound discretion he is of the opinion that\r\n  it would be contrary to public policy to divulge the information\r\n  desired.\r\n\r\n  “In certain cases, it may become necessary to introduce evidence\r\n  of a highly confidential or secret nature, as when an accused is\r\n  on trial for having unlawfully communicated information of such a\r\n  nature to persons not entitled thereto. In a case of this type, the\r\n  court should take adequate precautions to insure that no greater\r\n  dissemination of such evidence occurs than the necessities of the\r\n  trial require. The courtroom should be cleared of spectators while\r\n  such evidence is being received or commented upon, and all persons\r\n  whose duties require them to remain should be warned that they are\r\n  not to communicate such confidential or secret information....”\r\n\r\n  Since the Manual for Courts Martial was issued pursuant to the\r\n  authority of the President to prescribe procedure for such trials,\r\n  and Article 151 (b) MCM by its language is addressed to procedures\r\n  of such courts, it obviously does not affect access by the General\r\n  Accounting Office to Inspector Generals reports determined by the\r\n  Comptroller General to be necessary to the performance of his work,\r\n  particularly where the report requested is not one dealing with\r\n  personnel or criminal investigations.\r\n\r\n  Air Force Regulation 120-3, paragraph 9, October 11, 1954, and\r\n  similar regulations provide:\r\n\r\n  “Disclosure of or access to matters pertinent to an inquiry or\r\n  investigation will be limited to persons whose official duties\r\n  require such knowledge. The Manual for Courts Martial, 1951, states\r\n  that inspector-general investigations are privileged information.\r\n  The same privileged status applies to inquiries and investigations\r\n  conducted under this Regulation. Also paragraph 3, AFR 190-16,\r\n  29 July 1954, excludes investigative reports and reports of\r\n  inspectors general and base inspectors from release to the public\r\n  as information. Reports by investigators will not be released or\r\n  disclosed outside the Air Force without approval of the Secretary\r\n  of the Air Force.”\r\n\r\n  Presumably these regulations were issued pursuant to section 161,\r\n  Revised Statutes, title 5, United States Code, section 22, or\r\n  similar authority, authorizing the head of a department to issue\r\n  regulations, _not inconsistent with law_, for the conduct of his\r\n  department and the custody and use of its records. Since under\r\n  section 313 of the Budget and Accounting Act the Secretary is\r\n  required to give the Comptroller General access to the records, any\r\n  construction of the Air Force regulation denying the Comptroller\r\n  General access is improper, and the regulation to that extent,\r\n  being inconsistent with law, has no effect.\r\n\r\n  With reference to the right or privilege of the head of the\r\n  “Executive” branch of the Government to refuse to the legislative\r\n  and judicial branch of the Government free access to records in the\r\n  custody of the executive departments, support for such claim of\r\n  right or privilege is found in 25 Op. Atty. Gen. 326, 40 Op. Atty.\r\n  Gen. 45, and cases referred to therein.\r\n\r\n  Assuming, arguendo, that such right or privilege does exist, we\r\n  do not believe it warrants an executive agency denying to the\r\n  Comptroller General information or access to its documents in view\r\n  of section 313 of the Budget and Accounting Act which clearly\r\n  provides that “all departments ... shall furnish ... information\r\n  ...” required by the Comptroller General and that he shall have\r\n  “access to and the right to examine any ... documents of any such\r\n  department....” The opinion of the Attorney General in 1925, 34\r\n  Op. Atty. Gen. 446, discussed earlier, clearly recognizes the\r\n  prerogative of the Comptroller General to determine what papers he\r\n  should have to enable him properly to perform his audits and that\r\n  the departments are required to furnish them.\r\n\r\n  The right or privilege asserted from time to time by the executive\r\n  branch was considered in a study by the staff of the House\r\n  Committee on Government Operations entitled “The right of Congress\r\n  to obtain information from the Executive and from other agencies\r\n  of the Federal Government,” committee print dated May 3, 1956, and\r\n  in great detail by the House Committee on Government Operations\r\n  in connection with Public Law 85-619 approved August 12, 1958, as\r\n  were the court cases cited and relied upon by the Attorney General.\r\n  See House Report No. 1461, 85th Congress, 2d session. Also, there\r\n  was there considered a line of later decisions starting with\r\n  _McGrain_ v. _Daugherty_, 273 U. S. 135 (1927) which upheld the\r\n  power of Congress to require information sought for legislative\r\n  purposes. None of the cases relied upon by the Attorney General\r\n  involved demands by the Congress for information from the executive\r\n  agencies. This was considered in a study on the matter furnished\r\n  the committee by the Attorney General. See page 2938 of the\r\n  printed hearings before a subcommittee of the House Committee on\r\n  Government Operations on June 20 and 22, 1956, on “Availability of\r\n  Information from Federal Departments and Agencies” wherein after\r\n  citing and quoting from numerous court decisions he stated “None of\r\n  the foregoing cases involved the refusal by a head of department to\r\n  obey a call for papers or information. There has been no Supreme\r\n  Court decision dealing squarely with that question.”\r\n\r\n  As indicated, the precise question of whether the Congress has a\r\n  right to obtain information from the Executive which it refuses\r\n  to furnish because of its confidential nature has not been the\r\n  subject of a court decision. Where information sought by Congress\r\n  by an executive department has been refused, the Congress has,\r\n  at times, succeeded in bringing sufficient pressure to bear to\r\n  obtain the information, or the executive department has, upon\r\n  reconsideration, relented and furnished it. At other times the\r\n  Congress has not pressed the matter—possibly because of its feeling\r\n  that the President was in such a position that he should know\r\n  whether the information should be withheld, or that the Congress\r\n  had no machinery to force his compliance—and the information was\r\n  not furnished. But, regardless of whether such right or privilege\r\n  exists, it is clear that the Congress in passing on future\r\n  appropriations and other legislation has a right to know whether\r\n  the funds appropriated are being properly and efficiently used for\r\n  the purposes it intended and that any information available in that\r\n  regard should be available to the Comptroller General.\r\n\r\n  In view of the above, and in the absence of any judicial\r\n  determination specifically dealing with the rights of the\r\n  Comptroller General under section 313, we do not believe that the\r\n  position of the Secretary of the Air Force that the report in\r\n  question can be legally withheld is proper.\r\n\r\n  ROBERT F. KELLER, _General Counsel_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letter from the Attorney General to the President_\r\n\r\n  _December 22, 1960_\r\n\r\n  The PRESIDENT,\r\n  _The White House_.\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: You have requested my advice whether, under\r\n  the Constitution and laws of the United States, you have the\r\n  authority as Chief Executive to issue the two attached directives\r\n  to, respectively, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the\r\n  Treasury, concerning the availability of mutual security program\r\n  funds for the expenses of the Office of the Inspector General and\r\n  Comptroller established under section 533A of the Mutual Security\r\n  Act of 1954, as amended.\r\n\r\n  In an opinion I have furnished you at your request, I have\r\n  advised you of my conclusions that: First, the view taken by\r\n  the Comptroller General in his letter of December 8, 1960, that\r\n  the proviso contained in section 533A(d) of the Mutual Security\r\n  Act of 1954, as amended, has operated to cut off the funds here\r\n  in question, is erroneous. Second, that if this view of the\r\n  Comptroller General as to the meaning of the proviso is correct,\r\n  the proviso is unconstitutional. Third, that therefore, despite the\r\n  Comptroller General’s letters of December 8, 1960, and December 13,\r\n  1960, these mutual security program funds continue to be available\r\n  as heretofore for the expenses of the Office of the Inspector\r\n  General and Comptroller. The reasons for these conclusions are set\r\n  forth at length in my opinion.\r\n\r\n  Your directives to the Secretaries of State and the Treasury are,\r\n  you advise me, in your judgment desirable to insure that mutual\r\n  security program funds will be available until the end of your term\r\n  of office on January 20, 1961, as heretofore for the expenses of\r\n  the Office of the Inspector General and Comptroller. Under these\r\n  circumstances, I am of the opinion that you, as Chief Executive,\r\n  have the authority to issue the directives.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully,\r\n  WILLIAM P. ROGERS,\r\n  _Attorney General_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Opinion of the Attorney General of the United States Dated December\r\n19, 1960_\r\n\r\n\r\nMUTUAL SECURITY PROGRAM—CUTOFF OF FUNDS FROM OFFICE OF INSPECTOR\r\nGENERAL AND COMPTROLLER\r\n\r\n  Section 533A(d) of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 added by\r\n  section 401(h) of the Mutual Security Act of 1959 (73 Stat. 253),\r\n  which directs that the expenses of the Office of the Inspector\r\n  General and Comptroller with respect to programs under the Mutual\r\n  Security Act be charged to the appropriations made to carry out\r\n  such programs, _provided_ that all documents, reports, and other\r\n  materials relating to the operations and activities of that Office\r\n  are furnished upon request to the General Accounting Office, or\r\n  to any appropriate congressional committee or duly authorized\r\n  subcommittee, does not authorize the funds of the Office of the\r\n  Inspector General and Comptroller to be cut off because of the\r\n  failure of the State Department to furnish certain documents\r\n  relating to that Office to a congressional subcommittee, if the\r\n  President has issued a certificate pursuant to section 101(d) of\r\n  the Mutual Security and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1961\r\n  (74 Stat. 778), to the effect that he has forbidden the production\r\n  of those documents and states his reasons for so doing. A contrary\r\n  conclusion reached by the Comptroller General is incorrect, and,\r\n  therefore, funds continue to be available as heretofore for the\r\n  Office of the Inspector General and Comptroller.\r\n\r\n  The proviso in section 533A(d) does not expressly authorize the\r\n  funds of the Office of the Inspector General and Comptroller to\r\n  be cut off, and such a drastic consequence should not lightly be\r\n  inferred from ambiguous statutory language. Other provisions of the\r\n  Mutual Security Act of 1959, the Mutual Security Act of 1960 (74\r\n  Stat. 134), the Mutual Security and Related Agencies Appropriation\r\n  Act, 1960 (73 Stat. 717), and the Mutual Security and Related\r\n  Agencies Appropriation Act, 1961, indicate a congressional purpose\r\n  not to compel the disclosure of information concerning the mutual\r\n  security program which the President considers to be incompatible\r\n  with the security of the United States. Section 533A(d) should be\r\n  read in the light of this purpose.\r\n\r\n  Section 533A(d) has been suspended by section 101(d) of the\r\n  Mutual Security and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, 1961,\r\n  which provides that the failure to furnish documents, etc., to\r\n  Congress or to the Comptroller General will not result in a cutoff\r\n  of appropriated funds if the President certifies that he has\r\n  prohibited the production of the documents and states the reasons\r\n  for this action.\r\n\r\n  A construction of the proviso to section 533A(d), requiring funds\r\n  for the Office of the Inspector General and Comptroller to be\r\n  cut off for failure to supply documents, notwithstanding the\r\n  President’s certification, must be avoided because it not only\r\n  creates constitutional doubts, but would, if correct, render the\r\n  proviso unconstitutional. Congress cannot by direct action compel\r\n  the President to furnish to it information the disclosure of which\r\n  he considers contrary to the national interest. It cannot achieve\r\n  this result indirectly by placing a condition upon the expenditure\r\n  of appropriated funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D\r\n\r\n_Letter from President Kennedy to the Secretary of Defense_\r\n\r\n\r\n  _February 8, 1962_\r\n\r\n  DEAR MR. SECRETARY: You have brought to my attention the fact\r\n  that the Senate’s Special Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee\r\n  intends to ask witnesses from your department to give testimony\r\n  identifying the names of individuals who made or recommended\r\n  changes in specific speeches.\r\n\r\n  As you know, it has been and will be the consistent policy of\r\n  this administration to co-operate fully with the committees of\r\n  the Congress with respect to the furnishing of information. In\r\n  accordance with this policy, you have made available to the\r\n  subcommittee 1500 speeches with marginal notes, hundreds of\r\n  other documents and the names of the fourteen individual speech\r\n  reviewers, eleven of whom are military officers. You have also made\r\n  available the fullest possible background information about each of\r\n  these men, whose record of service and devotion to the country is\r\n  unquestioned in every case; and you have permitted the committee\r\n  staff to interview all witnesses requested and to conduct such\r\n  interviews outside the presence of any departmental representative.\r\n  Finally, you have identified the departmental source of each\r\n  suggested change, and offered to furnish in writing an explanation\r\n  of each such change, and the policy or guideline under which it was\r\n  made.\r\n\r\n  Your statement that these changes are your responsibility, that\r\n  they were made under your policies and guidelines and those of\r\n  this administration and that you would be willing to explain\r\n  them in detail, is both fitting and accurate, and offers to the\r\n  subcommittee all the information properly needed for purposes\r\n  of its current inquiry. It is equally clear that it would not\r\n  be possible for you to maintain an orderly department, and\r\n  receive the candid advice and loyal respect of your subordinates,\r\n  if they—instead of you and your senior associates—are to be\r\n  individually answerable to the Congress as well as to you for their\r\n  internal acts and advice.\r\n\r\n  For these reasons, and in accordance with the precedents on\r\n  separation of powers established by my predecessors from the\r\n  first to the last, I have concluded that it would be contrary\r\n  to the public interest to make available any information which\r\n  would enable the subcommittee to identify and hold accountable\r\n  any individual with respect to any particular speech that he has\r\n  reviewed. I therefore direct you, and all personnel under the\r\n  jurisdiction of your department, not to give any testimony or\r\n  produce any documents which would disclose such information; and I\r\n  am issuing parallel instructions to the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n  The principle which is at stake here cannot be automatically\r\n  applied to every request for information. Each case must be judged\r\n  on its own merits. But I do not intend to permit subordinate\r\n  officials of our career services to bear the brunt of congressional\r\n  inquiry into policies which are the responsibilities of their\r\n  superiors.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely yours,\r\n  JOHN F. KENNEDY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E\r\n\r\n_Executive Privilege Correspondence between President Kennedy and\r\nCongressman John E. Moss_\r\n\r\n\r\n  February 15, 1962\r\n\r\n  _The Honorable\r\n  John F. Kennedy\r\n  The President of the United States\r\n  The White House\r\n  Washington, D.C._\r\n\r\n  Dear Mr. President:\r\n\r\n  In your letter of February 8, 1962 to Secretary McNamara\r\n  you directed him to refuse certain information to a Senate\r\n  Subcommittee. The concluding paragraph of your letter stated:\r\n\r\n    “The principle which is at stake here cannot be automatically\r\n    applied to every request for information. Each case must be\r\n    judged on its merits.”\r\n\r\n  A similar letter from President Eisenhower on May 17, 1954 also\r\n  refused information to a Senate Subcommittee, setting forth the\r\n  same arguments covered in your letter. President Eisenhower did\r\n  not, however, state that future questions of availability of\r\n  information to the Congress would have to be answered as they came\r\n  up.\r\n\r\n  I know you are aware of the result of President Eisenhower’s\r\n  letter. Time after time Executive Branch employees far down the\r\n  administrative line from the President fell back on his letter of\r\n  May 17, 1954 as authority to withhold information from the Congress\r\n  and the public.\r\n\r\n  Some of the cases are well known—the Dixon-Yates matter and the\r\n  investigation of East-West trade controls, for instance—but many\r\n  of the refusals based on President Eisenhower’s letter of May 17,\r\n  1954 received no public notice. A report of the House Committee\r\n  on Government Operations covering the five years from June, 1955\r\n  through June, 1960 lists 44 cases of Executive Branch officials\r\n  refusing information on the basis of the principles set forth in\r\n  the May 17, 1954 letter.\r\n\r\n  I am confident that you share my belief that your letter of\r\n  February 8, 1962 to Secretary McNamara should not be seized upon\r\n  by Executive Branch employees—many of them holding the same\r\n  policymaking positions of responsibility they did under the\r\n  Eisenhower Administration—as a new claim of authority to withhold\r\n  information from the Congress and the public. A Subcommittee staff\r\n  study indicates that during the year between the time you took\r\n  office and February 8, 1962 the claim of an “executive privilege”\r\n  to withhold government information was not used successfully once,\r\n  compared to the dozens of times in previous years administrative\r\n  employees held up “executive privilege” as a shield against public\r\n  and Congressional access to information.\r\n\r\n  Although your letter of February 8, 1962 stated clearly that\r\n  the principle involved could not be applied automatically to\r\n  restrict information, this warning received little public notice.\r\n  Clarification of this point would, I believe, serve to prevent the\r\n  rash of restrictions on government information which followed the\r\n  May 17, 1954 letter from President Eisenhower.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely,\r\n  /s/ John E. Moss\r\n  Chairman\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE WHITE HOUSE\r\n  _Washington_\r\n\r\n  _March 7, 1962_\r\n\r\n  Dear Mr. Chairman:\r\n\r\n  This is in reply to your letter of last month inquiring generally\r\n  about the practice this Administration will follow in invoking the\r\n  doctrine of executive privilege in withholding certain information\r\n  from the Congress.\r\n\r\n  As your letter indicated, my letter of February 8 to Secretary\r\n  McNamara made it perfectly clear that the directive to refuse\r\n  to make certain specific information available to a special\r\n  subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee was limited\r\n  to that specific request and that “each case must be judged on its\r\n  merits.”\r\n\r\n  As you know, this Administration has gone to great lengths to\r\n  achieve full co-operation with the Congress in making available to\r\n  it all appropriate documents, correspondence and information. That\r\n  is the basic policy of this Administration, and it will continue\r\n  to be so. Executive privilege can be invoked only by the President\r\n  and will not be used without specific Presidential approval.\r\n  Your own interest in assuring the widest public accessibility\r\n  to governmental information is, of course, well known, and I\r\n  can assure you this Administration will continue to co-operate\r\n  with your subcommittee and the entire Congress in achieving this\r\n  objective.\r\n\r\n  Sincerely,\r\n  /s/ JOHN F. KENNEDY\r\n\r\n  Honorable John E. Moss\r\n  Chairman\r\n  Special Government Information\r\n    Subcommittee of the Committee\r\n    on Government Operations\r\n  House of Representatives\r\n  Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n  pg 27 Changed: political figures organized a constuction\r\n             to: political figures organized a construction\r\n\r\n  pg 57 Changed: records or testify even when suppoenaed\r\n             to: records or testify even when subpoenaed\r\n\r\n  pg 81 Changed: effective administration that employes\r\n             to: effective administration that employees\r\n\r\n  pg 164 Changed: and Hardy decided to to try\r\n              to: and Hardy decided to try\r\n\r\n  pg 238 Changed: executive privilege in withholdng\r\n              to: executive privilege in withholding",
