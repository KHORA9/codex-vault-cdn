McCLEARY, M.C.\r\n\r\nLATE TEACHER OF CIVICS AND HISTORY IN THE STATE NORMAL SCHOOL\r\nMANKATO, MINNESOTA\r\nLIFE MEMBER MINNESOTA HISTORICAL SOCIETY\r\n\r\nREVISED TO 1897\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (House of Representatives) UNITED STATES CAPITOL (Senate.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MEMBERS OF MY CLASSES IN CIVICS, WHOSE QUESTIONS HAVE AIDED ME IN\r\nDETERMINING WHAT SUBJECTS TO TREAT, AND WHOSE EARNESTNESS AND INTELLIGENCE\r\nHAVE MADE IT A PLEASURE TO BE THEIR TEACHER, THIS BOOK IS AFFECTIONATELY\r\nINSCRIBED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thought constantly in mind in the preparation of this book has been to\r\nfurnish useful material in usable form.\r\n\r\nAttention is invited to the scope of the work. The Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, not a mere abstract of it but a careful study of the text,\r\nis properly given much space but is not allowed a monopoly of it. Each of\r\nour governmental institutions deserves and receives a share of\r\nconsideration. The order of presentation--beginning with the town, where\r\nthe student can observe the operations of government, and proceeding\r\ngradually to the consideration of government in general--is based upon\r\nconclusions reached during eighteen years of experience in teaching this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMatter to be used chiefly for reference is placed in the appendix.\r\nAttention is asked to the amount of information which, by means of\r\ntabulations and other modes of condensation, is therein contained.\r\nDocuments easily obtainable, such as the Declaration of Independence, are\r\nomitted to make room for typical and other interesting documents not\r\nusually accessible.\r\n\r\nIs this book intended to be an office-holders' manual? No; but it _is_\r\nintended to help students to get an insight into the way in which public\r\nbusiness is carried on.\r\n\r\nIs it designed as an elementary treatise on law? No; but the hope is\r\nindulged that the young people who study it will catch something of the\r\n_spirit_ of law, which to know is to respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nPREFACE,\r\nTO TEACHERS,\r\nTO STUDENTS,\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT: WHAT IT IS AND WHY IT IS,\r\n\r\nPART I.--GOVERNMENT WITHIN THE STATE.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER.\r\n     I.--THE TOWN: WHY AND HOW ORGANIZED, ETC.,\r\n    II.--PRIMITIVE MODES OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE,\r\n   III.--PROCEEDINGS IN A JUSTICE COURT,\r\n    IV.--THE INCORPORATED VILLAGE,\r\n     V.--THE CITY,\r\n    VI.--THE COUNTY,\r\n   VII.--ESTABLISHING JUSTICE IN THE COUNTY,\r\n  VIII.--HISTORICAL,\r\n\r\nPART II.--THE STATE.\r\n\r\n    IX.--STATES: WHY AND HOW CREATED,\r\n     X.--STATE CONSTITUTIONS,\r\n    XI.--DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT,\r\n   XII.--THE LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n  XIII.--THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n   XIV.--OTHER STATE OFFICERS,\r\n    XV.--THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT,\r\n   XVI.--RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT,\r\n\r\nPART III.--THE NATION.\r\n\r\n  XVII.--THE CAUSES OF THE REVOLUTION,\r\n XVIII.--THE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION,\r\n   XIX.--THE ORIGIN OF THE CONSTITUTION,\r\n    XX.--THE CONSTITUTION: PREAMBLE,\r\n   XXI.--STRUCTURE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH,\r\n  XXII.--POWERS OF CONGRESS,\r\n XXIII.--THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH,\r\n  XXIV.--THE JUDICIAL BRANCH,\r\n   XXV.--THE RELATIONS OF THE STATES,\r\n  XXVI.--MODES OF AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION,\r\n XXVII.--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS,\r\nXXVIII.--RATIFICATION OF THE CONSTITUTION,\r\n  XXIX.--THE AMENDMENTS,\r\n\r\nPART IV.--GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n   XXX.--FORMS OF GOVERNMENT,\r\n\r\nPART V.--COMMERCIAL LAW.\r\n\r\n  XXXI.--CONTRACTS,\r\n XXXII.--AGENCY,\r\nXXXIII.--PARTNERSHIP,\r\n XXXIV.--CORPORATIONS,\r\n  XXXV.--COMMERCIAL PAPER,\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nA.--FORMS,\r\nB.--TABLES,\r\nC.--HOW SOME THINGS ARE DONE,\r\nD.--SOME PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW,\r\nE.--DOCUMENTS,\r\n\r\nGENERAL INDEX,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO TEACHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHighly competent teachers are the very ones who receive most kindly\r\nsuggestions meant to be helpful. For such these words are intended.\r\n\r\nThe local organizations are so related that it is advisable for all\r\nclasses to consider each of them. Especial attention should, however, be\r\ngiven to the organization (town, village or city) in which the school is.\r\nHere considerable time can be profitably spent, and the matter in the book\r\nmay be much amplified. Here must be laid the basis of future study.\r\n\r\nCertain typical instruments deserve careful study. For a student to have\r\nmade out understandingly an official bond, for instance, is for him to\r\nhave gained greatly in intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt will be of great advantage to the class for the teacher to have a\r\ncomplete set of the papers whose forms are given in Appendix A. These may\r\nbe obtained at almost any newspaper office, at a cost of about 50 cents.\r\n\r\nA scrap-book or series of envelopes in which to file newspaper clippings\r\nillustrative of the every-day workings of government, may be made very\r\nuseful. Pupils should be permitted and encouraged to contribute.\r\n\r\nOne good way to review is for the teacher to give out, say once in two\r\nweeks, a set of twenty-five or more questions, each of which may be\r\nanswered in a few words; have the pupils write their answers; and the\r\ncorrect answers being given by teacher or pupils, each may mark his own\r\npaper. Each pupil may thus discover where he is strong and where weak.\r\n\r\nThe questions given for debate may be discussed by the literary society.\r\nOr for morning exercises, one student may on a certain day present one\r\nside of the argument, and on the following day the negative may be brought\r\nout by another student.\r\n\r\nA student should not be required to submit his good name to the chances of\r\nanswering a certain set of questions, however excellent, at the\r\nexamination, when from anxiety or other causes he may fall far short of\r\ndoing himself justice. One good plan is to allow each student to make up\r\n50 percent of his record during the progress of the work, by bringing in,\r\nsay, five carefully prepared papers. One of these may be a _resumé_ of\r\nmatter pertaining to his local organization; another may be an account of\r\na trial observed, or other governmental work which the student may have\r\nseen performed; a third may be a synopsis of the president's message; the\r\nfourth, a general tabulation of the constitution; the fifth, a review of\r\nsome book on government, or a paper on a subject of the student's own\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nAmong reference books, every school should have at least the Revised\r\nStatutes of the state and of the United States, the Legislative Manual of\r\nthe state, a good political almanac for the current year, the\r\nCongressional Directory, and Alton's Among the Lawmakers.\r\n\r\nA Teachers' Manual, giving answers to the pertinent questions contained\r\nherein, and many useful hints as to the details of teaching Civics, is\r\npublished in connection with this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO STUDENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will notice in chapter one that at the close of nearly every paragraph\r\nquestions are thrown in. They are inserted to help you cultivate in\r\nyourself the very valuable habit of rigid self-examination. We are all\r\nliable to assume too soon that we have the thought. Not to mar the look of\r\nthe page, the questions are thenceforward placed only at the close of the\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nYou will soon discover that these questions are so framed as to require\r\nyou to read not only on the lines and _between_ them, but also right down\r\n_into_ them. Even then you will not be able to answer all of the\r\nquestions. The information may not be in the book at all. You may have to\r\nlook around a long time for the answer.\r\n\r\nIf you occasionally come to a question which you can neither answer nor\r\ndismiss from your mind, be thankful for the question and that you are\r\nbright enough to be affected in this way. You have doubtless discovered\r\nthat some of your best intellectual work, your most fruitful study, has\r\nbeen done on just such questions.\r\n\r\nAfter studying a provision of the constitution of the United States, you\r\nshould be able to answer these four questions: 1. What does it _say?_ 2.\r\nWhat does it _mean?_ 3. _Why_ was the provision inserted? 4. How is it\r\ncarried into practical effect? Some of the provisions should be so\r\nthoroughly committed to memory that at any time they may be accurately\r\nquoted. The ability to quote exactly is an accomplishment well worth\r\nacquiring.\r\n\r\nAfter you have got through with a line of investigation it is a good thing\r\nto make a synopsis of the conclusions reached. Hints are given at\r\nappropriate places as to how this may be done. But the doing of it is left\r\nto you, that you may have the pleasure and profit resulting therefrom.\r\n\r\nFinally, without fretting yourself unnecessarily, be possessed of a \"noble\r\ndissatisfaction\" with vague half-knowledge. Try to see clearly. Government\r\nis so much a matter of common sense, that you can assuredly understand\r\nmuch of it if you determine so to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDIES IN CIVICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT: WHAT IT IS AND WHY IT IS.\r\n\r\nAt the very beginning of our study, two questions naturally present\r\nthemselves: First. What is government? Second. Why do we have such a\r\nthing?\r\n\r\nThese questions are much easier to ask than to answer. The wisest men of\r\nthe ages have pondered upon them, and their answers have varied widely.\r\nYet we need not despair. Even boys and girls can work out moderately good\r\nanswers, if they will approach the questions seriously and with a\r\ndetermination to get as near the root of the matter as possible.\r\n\r\nBeginning without attempting an exact definition of government, because we\r\nall have a notion of what it is, we notice that only certain animals are\r\ngovernment-forming. Among these may be mentioned the ant, the bee, and\r\nman. The fox, the bear, and the lion represent the other class. If we\r\nshould make two lists, including in one all the animals of the first class\r\nand in the other all those of the second class, we should make this\r\ndiscovery, that government-forming animals are those which by nature live\r\ntogether in companies, while the other class as a rule live apart. The\r\ngeneralization reached is, that _only gregarious animals form\r\ngovernments_. We would discover upon further investigation that the\r\ngreater the interdependence of the individuals, the more complex the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nConfining our attention now to man, whose government is the most complex,\r\nwe may put our generalization into this form: Man establishes government\r\nbecause _by nature he is a social being_. This may be taken as the\r\nfundamental reason. Let us now proceed to trace the relation between cause\r\nand effect.\r\n\r\nIn order that people may go from place to place to meet others for\r\npleasure or business, roads are needed. Some of these roads may cross\r\nstreams too deep for fording, so bridges must be provided. These things\r\nare for the good of all; they are public needs, and should be provided by\r\nthe public. But \"what is every body's business is nobody's business.\" It\r\nfollows that the public must appoint certain persons to look after such\r\nthings. By the act of appointing these persons, society becomes to that\r\nextent organized. We see, then, that society organizes in order to provide\r\ncertain public improvements, _to carry on certain public works_.\r\n\r\nFor his own preservation, man is endowed with another quality, namely,\r\nselfishness. Sometimes this is so strong in a person as to cause him to\r\ndisregard the rights of others. By experience man has learned that _every_\r\nperson is interested in seeing that conflicting claims are settled on a\r\nbetter basis than that of the relative strength of the contestants. In\r\nother words, all are interested in the prevalence of peace and the\r\nrightful settlement of disputes. That this work may surely be done, it is\r\nobvious that society must appoint certain persons to attend to it; that\r\nis, society organizes _to establish justice._\r\n\r\nCommunities take their character from that of the individuals composing\r\nthem, therefore communities are selfish. A third reason appears, then, for\r\nthe organization of society, namely, _the common defense._\r\n\r\nBut this organization of society is the very thing that we call\r\ngovernment. We may, therefore, answer the two questions proposed at the\r\nbeginning in this way:\r\n\r\n_Government is the organization of society to carry on public works, to\r\nestablish justice, and to provide for the common defense._\r\n\r\nThe term _government_ is also applied to the body of persons into whose\r\nhands is committed the management of public affairs.\r\n\r\nTo show that government is a necessity to man, let us imagine a company of\r\nseveral hundred men, women, and children, who have left their former home\r\non account of the tyranny of the government. So harshly have they been\r\ntreated, that they have ascribed all their misery to the thing called\r\ngovernment, and they resolve that they will have none in their new home.\r\nThey discover an island in the ocean, which seems never to have been\r\noccupied, and which appears \"a goodly land.\" Here they resolve to settle.\r\n\r\nThey help each other in building the houses; each takes from the forest\r\nthe wood that he needs for fuel; they graze the cattle in a common meadow;\r\nthey till a common field and all share in the harvest. For a time all goes\r\nwell. But mutterings begin to be heard. It is found that some are\r\nunwilling to do their share of the work. It becomes manifest to the\r\nthoughtful that community of property must be given up and private\r\nownership be introduced, or else that the common work must be regulated.\r\nIn the latter case, government is established by the very act of\r\nregulation; they are establishing justice. If they resolve to adopt\r\nprivate ownership, industry will diversify, they will begin to spread out\r\nover the island, and public improvements will be needed, such as those\r\nspecified above. The conflict of interests will soon necessitate tribunals\r\nfor the settlement of disputes. And thus government would, in either case,\r\ninevitably be established. A visit from savages inhabiting another island\r\nwould show the utility of the organization for common defense.\r\n\r\nThus government seems a necessary consequence of man's nature.\r\n\r\nIn this country we have the general government and state governments, the\r\nlatter acting chiefly through local organizations. For obvious reasons,\r\nthe common defense is vested in the general government. For reasons that\r\nwill appear, most of the work of public improvement and establishing\r\njustice is entrusted to the state and local governments.\r\n\r\nThese we shall now proceed to study, beginning at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERIES.--Would government be necessary if man were morally perfect? Why\r\nis this organization of society called _government?_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT WITHIN THE STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN: WHY AND HOW ORGANIZED; OFFICERS; TOWN BUSINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNecessity.--Now instead of a company going to an island to found new\r\nhomes, let us think of immigrants to a new part of a state.\r\n\r\nLike the people on the island, they will need roads, bridges, and schools;\r\nand they will desire to preserve the local peace. Hence they, too, will\r\nneed to organize as a political body.\r\n\r\nSize.--Since these people are going to meet at stated periods to agree\r\nupon the amounts to be put into public improvements and to select officers\r\nto carry out their wishes, the territory covered by the organization\r\nshould not be very large. It should be of such a size that every one\r\nentitled to do so can reach the place of meeting, take part in the work\r\nthereof, and return home the same day, even if he has no team.\r\n\r\nBasis.--Will anything be found already done to facilitate matters? Yes.\r\nThose parts of the state open to settlement will be found surveyed into\r\nportions six miles square. These squares are called in the survey\r\n\"townships,\" plainly indicating that they were meant by the general\r\ngovernment to be convenient bases for the organization of \"towns.\" And\r\nthey have been so accepted.\r\n\r\nDraw a township. Subdivide it into sections and number them in accordance\r\nwith the U.S. survey. Subdivide a section into forties, and describe each\r\nforty. Why do we have such divisions of a township? Locate your father's\r\nfarm. What is the difference between a _township_ and a _town?_ [Footnote:\r\nIn some states the terms \"congressional township\" and \"civil township\" are\r\nused.]\r\n\r\nCorporate Powers.--A town is in some respects like an individual. It can\r\nsue and be sued. It can borrow money. It can buy or rent property needed\r\nfor public purposes. And it can sell property for which it has no further\r\nuse. Because a town can do these things as an individual can it is called\r\na corporation, and such powers are called corporate powers.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that \"the town\" can do these things, we mean of course that\r\nthe people of the town as a political body can do them, through the proper\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nOfficers Needed.--The town needs one or more persons to act for it in its\r\ncorporate capacity and to have general charge of its interests.\r\n\r\nShould there be one, or more than one? Why? How many are there?\r\n\r\nEvery business transaction should be recorded, and the town should have a\r\nrecording officer or secretary.\r\n\r\nWhat is the recording officer in this town called? What is his name? Which\r\nofficer would naturally be the custodian of public papers?\r\n\r\nIt takes money to build bridges and to carry on other public works, and\r\nthe town needs some one to take charge of the public funds.\r\n\r\nWhat is the officer called? Who occupies that position in this town? How\r\nis he prevented from misappropriating the money belonging to the people?\r\n\r\nOur plan for raising public money for local purposes is, in general, that\r\neach person shall contribute _according to the value of his property._\r\nHence the town needs a competent and reliable man to value each person's\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nWhat is such an officer called? What is the name of the one in this town?\r\nIs any property exempt from taxation? Why? Just how is the value of the\r\nreal estate in the town ascertained for the purpose of taxation? The value\r\nof the personal property? Get a list and find out what questions this\r\nofficer asks. Read the statement at the bottom of the list carefully, and\r\nthen form an opinion of a person who would answer the questions\r\nuntruthfully for the purpose of lowering his taxes.\r\n\r\nThe immediate care of the roads will demand the attention of one or more\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nHow many in this town? What are such officers called? Name them.\r\n\r\nDifferences about property of small value sometimes arise, and to go far\r\nfrom home to have them settled would involve too much expense of time and\r\nmoney; hence the necessity of local officers of justice. These officers\r\nare needed also because petty acts of lawlessness are liable to occur.\r\n\r\nHow many justices of the peace are there in each town? Why that number?\r\nWhat is the extent of their jurisdiction?\r\n\r\nThe arrest of criminals, the serving of legal papers, and the carrying out\r\nof the decisions of justices of the peace, make it necessary to have one\r\nor more other officers.\r\n\r\nWhat are such officers called? How many in each town? Why? Look up the\r\nhistory of this office; it is interesting.\r\n\r\nThe public schools of the town may be managed either by a town board of\r\ntrustees, who locate all of the school-houses, engage all of the teachers,\r\nand provide necessary material for all of the schools in the town; or the\r\ntown may be divided into districts, the school in each being managed by\r\nits own school board.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the township system or the district system prevail in this state?\r\nName some state in which the other system prevails.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Chosen.--In this country most of the public officers are chosen by the\r\npeople interested. The great problem of election is how to ascertain the\r\nreal will of those entitled to express an opinion or have a choice. And\r\nall the arrangements for conducting elections have in view one of two\r\nthings: either to facilitate voting or to prevent fraud. The town serves\r\nas a convenient voting precinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nFind out from the statutes or from the town manual or by inquiry, when the\r\ntown meeting is held; how notice is given; how it is known who may vote;\r\nwho are judges of election; how many clerks there are; how voting is done;\r\nhow the votes are counted and the result made known; what reports of the\r\nelection are made. Give the reason for each provision. Can a person vote\r\nby proxy? Why? What is to prevent a person from voting more than once? If\r\nthe polls are open seven hours, and it takes one minute to vote, how many\r\npersons can vote at one polling place? What may be done in case there are\r\nmore than that number of voters in the town? How are road overseers\r\nelected, and in what part of the day? Why then? What other business is\r\ntransacted at town meeting? How do the people know how much money will be\r\nneeded for the coming year's improvements? How do they learn the nature\r\nand expense of last year's improvements?\r\n\r\nGive four general reasons for our having towns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL WORK FOR STUDENTS.\r\n\r\nI. ORGANIZING A TOWN.\r\n\r\nPrepare in due form a petition to the proper authorities asking that a new\r\ntown be organized. [Footnote: For forms see Appendix. If necessary, all\r\nthe pupils in the room or school may act as \"legal voters.\" (This\r\n\"Practical Work\" may be omitted until the review, if deemed best.)] Be\r\nsure that the order establishing the new town is duly made out, signed,\r\nattested and filed. Give reasons for each step.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. HOLDING ANNUAL TOWN MEETING.\r\n\r\n1. Preliminary.--What report does each road overseer make to the\r\nsupervisors? When is the report due? What do the supervisors require this\r\ninformation for?\r\n\r\nWho gives notice of the town meeting? When? How?\r\n\r\nWhen does the town treasurer make his report to the persons appointed to\r\nexamine his accounts? When does this examination take place? What is its\r\npurpose?\r\n\r\nWhat report does the board of supervisors make to the people at the town\r\nmeeting? When is it prepared? Why is it necessary?\r\n\r\nWhy so many preliminaries?\r\n\r\n2. The Town Meeting.--That everything may be done \"decently and in order,\"\r\nit will be necessary to consult carefully the statutes or the town manual.\r\nBe sure\r\n\r\n (a) That the proper officers are in charge.\r\n (b) That the order of business is announced and followed.\r\n (c) That the polls are duly declared open.\r\n (d) That the voting is done in exact accordance with law.\r\n (e) That general business is attended to at the proper time.\r\n (f) That reports of officers are duly read and acted upon.\r\n (g) That appropriations for the succeeding year are duly made.\r\n (h) That the minutes of the meeting are carefully kept.\r\n (i) That the polls are closed in due form.\r\n (j) That the votes are counted and the result made known according to law.\r\n (k) That all reports of the meeting are made on time and in due form.\r\n\r\n3. After Town Meeting.--See that all officers elected \"qualify\" on time\r\nand in strict accordance with law. Especial care will be needed in making\r\nout the bonds.\r\n\r\nTown clerk must certify to proper officer the tax levied at town meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. LAYING OUT AND MAINTAINING ROADS.\r\n\r\n1. Laying out a Road.--Make out a petition for a town road, have it duly\r\nsigned and posted. In due season present it to the supervisors who were\r\nelected at your town meeting.\r\n\r\nThe supervisors, after examining the petition carefully and being sure\r\nthat it is in proper form and that it has been duly posted, will appoint a\r\ntime and place of hearing and give due notice thereof.\r\n\r\nWhen the day of hearing arrives they will examine the proofs of the\r\nposting and service of the notices of hearing before proceeding to act\r\nupon the petition.\r\n\r\nHaving heard arguments for and against the laying of the road, the\r\nsupervisors will render their decision in due form.\r\n\r\nIn awarding damages, the supervisors will probably find four classes of\r\npersons: first, those to whom the road is of as much benefit as damage,\r\nand who admit the fact; second, those who should have damages, and are\r\nreasonable in their demands; third, those who claim more damages than they\r\nare in the judgment of the supervisors entitled to; and fourth, those who\r\nfrom some cause, (absence, perhaps,) do not present any claim. From the\r\nfirst class, the supervisors can readily get a release of damages. With\r\nthe second, they can easily come to an agreement as to damages. To the\r\nthird and fourth, they must make an award of damages. Let all of these\r\ncases arise and be taken care of.\r\n\r\nThe supervisors must be careful to issue their road order in proper form,\r\nand to see that the order, together with the petition, notices, affidavits\r\nand awards of damages, are filed correctly and on time. The town clerk\r\nmust read the law carefully to ascertain his duty, and then perform it\r\nexactly. See that fences are ordered to be removed. Let one of the persons\r\nwho feels himself aggrieved by the decision of the supervisors, \"appeal\"\r\nto a proper court. Let this be done in due form. As each step is taken,\r\nlet the reasons for it be made clear.\r\n\r\n2. Maintaining Roads.--Road overseers return the list of persons liable to\r\nroad labor. How are these facts ascertained, and when must the \"return\" be\r\nmade?\r\n\r\nSupervisors meet and assess road labor, and sign road tax warrants. When\r\nand how is this done?\r\n\r\nHow is the road tax usually paid? How else may it be paid? How does the\r\noverseer indicate that a person's tax is paid? If a person liable to road\r\ntax does not \"commute,\" and yet neglects or refuses to appear when duly\r\nnotified by the road overseer, what can the latter do about it? How is\r\ndelinquent road tax collected? How can a person who has paid his tax prove\r\nthat he has paid it?\r\n\r\nUnder which of the three great purposes of government mentioned in the\r\npreliminary chapter does the making of roads come?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN--_Continued_.\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes the town system or the district system prevail in this state? If the\r\nlatter, tell how a school district is organized. Give an account of the\r\norganization of this district.\r\n\r\nHow many and what officers have charge of the schools? State the duties of\r\neach. Name the officers in this district. When are the officers chosen,\r\nand how long do they serve? Are all chosen at once? Why? How do they\r\n\"qualify?\" Are women eligible to school offices? To any other?\r\n\r\nDid you ever attend the annual meeting? When is it held? Why held then?\r\nWho take part? What business is transacted? What are \"special\" school\r\nmeetings?\r\n\r\nWhat expenses must be met in having a school? Where does the money come\r\nfrom? How does the treasurer get it into his possession? What is to\r\nprevent his misusing it?\r\n\r\nBy whom is the teacher chosen? Why not elect the teacher at the annual\r\nmeeting? Get a teacher's contract and find out who the contracting parties\r\nare, and what each agrees to do. Why is the contract in writing? How many\r\ncopies of it are made? Who keep them, and why?\r\n\r\nIf you had a bill against the district, how would you proceed to get your\r\nmoney? If the district refused or neglected to pay you, what could you do?\r\nIf some one owed the district and refused to pay, what could it do?\r\n\r\nWho owns the school buildings and grounds? How was ownership obtained? If\r\nit seemed best to erect a new schoolhouse in some other part of the\r\ndistrict, what could be done with the present buildings and grounds? Could\r\nthe district buy land for other than school purposes? Could it lend money\r\nif it had any to spare? If the district had not money enough to erect its\r\nbuildings, what could it do? What are the corporate powers of a district?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Questions for Debate._\r\n\r\n_Resolved,_ That it is unfair to tax a bachelor to support a school.\r\n\r\n_Resolved,_ That the town system is better than the district system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE MODES OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrial by Ordeal.--Boys settle some matters about which they cannot agree\r\nby \"tossing up a penny,\" or by \"drawing cuts.\" In a game of ball they\r\ndetermine \"first innings\" by \"tossing the bat.\" Differences in a game of\r\nmarbles, they settle by guessing \"odd or even,\" or by \"trying it over to\r\nprove it.\" In all these modes of adjustment there is an appeal to\r\n_chance._ Probably behind these practices is the feeling that the boy who\r\nought to win will somehow guess right. This appealing to chance to settle\r\nquestions of fact is characteristic of society in its primitive state.\r\nModes of establishing justice similar in principle to these boy practices\r\nprevail to this day among superstitious peoples. They have prevailed even\r\nin Europe, not only among people of low mental power, but also among the\r\ncultured Greeks. Among our own Saxon ancestors the following modes of\r\ntrial are known to have been used: A person accused of crime was required\r\nto walk blindfolded and barefoot over a piece of ground on which hot\r\nploughshares lay at unequal distances, or to plunge his arm into hot\r\nwater. If in either case he escaped unhurt he was declared innocent. This\r\nwas called Trial by Ordeal. The theory was that Providence would protect\r\nthe innocent.\r\n\r\nTrial by Battle.--Sometimes boys settle their disputes by _fighting_.\r\nThis, too, was one of the modes of adjudication prevalent in early times\r\namong men. Trial by Battle was introduced into England by the Normans. \"It\r\nwas the last and most solemn resort to try titles to real estate.\"\r\n[Footnote: Dole's Talks about Law, p. 53.] The duel remained until\r\nrecently, and indeed yet remains in some countries, as a reminder of that\r\ntime. And disputes between countries are even now, almost without\r\nexception, settled by an appeal to arms. Perhaps the thought is that \"he\r\nis thrice armed that hath his quarrel just.\" Sometimes when one of the\r\nboys is too small to fight for his rights, another boy will take his part\r\nand fight in his stead. Similarly, in the Trial by Battle, the parties\r\ncould fight personally or by \"champion.\" Interesting accounts of this mode\r\nof trial are given by Green and Blackstone, and in Scott's \"Talisman.\"\r\n\r\nArbitration.--Two boys who have a difference may \"leave it to\" some other\r\nboy in whom they both have confidence. And men did and do settle disputes\r\nin a similar way. They call it settlement by Arbitration.\r\n\r\nA boy would hardly refer a matter for decision to his little brother. Why?\r\n\r\nFolk-Moot.--Still another common way for two boys to decide a question\r\nabout which they differ is to \"leave it to the boys,\" some of whom are\r\nknowing to the facts and others not. Each of the disputants tells his\r\nstory, subject to more or less interruption, and calls upon other boys to\r\ncorroborate his statements. The assembled company then decides the matter,\r\n\"renders its verdict,\" and if necessary carries it into execution. In this\r\nprocedure the boys are re-enacting the scenes of the _Folk-moot_ or town\r\nmeeting of our Saxon ancestors.\r\n\r\nBoy-Courts.--Let us look at this boy-court again to discover its principal\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we see that _every_ boy in the crowd feels that he has\r\na right to assist in arriving at the decision, that \"the boys\"\r\ncollectively are to settle the matter. In other words, that _the\r\nestablishment of justice is a public trust._ So our Saxon forefathers used\r\nto come together in the Folk-moot and as a body decide differences between\r\nman and man. The boys have no special persons to perform special duties;\r\nthat is, no court officers. Neither, at first, did those old Saxons.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in the boy-court the _facts_ in the case are brought out by\r\nmeans of _witnesses_. So it was in the Folk-moot, and so it is in most\r\ncivilized countries today. Among those old Saxons the custom grew up of\r\nallowing the facts in the case to be determined by _twelve_ men of the\r\nneighborhood, _who were most intimately acquainted with those facts_. When\r\nthey came over to England these Saxons brought this custom with them, and\r\nfrom it has been developed the Trial by Jury. The colonists of this\r\ncountry, most of whom came from England, brought with them this important\r\nelement in the establishment of justice, and it is found today in nearly\r\nall the states.\r\n\r\nAgain, when in the boy-court the facts of the case have been established\r\nand it becomes necessary to apply the rules of the game to the particular\r\ncase, the boys frequently, invariably in difficult cases, turn to some boy\r\nor boys known to be well versed in the principles of the game, and defer\r\nto his or their opinion. And, similarly, in the Folk-moot, much deference\r\nwas paid in rendering judgment to the old men who for many years had\r\nhelped to render justice, and who, in consequence, had much knowledge of\r\nthe customs, unwritten laws, in accordance with which decisions were\r\nrendered. In this deference to one or more persons who are recognized as\r\nunderstanding the principles involved in the case, we see the germ of\r\n_judgeship_ in our present courts.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, a boy naturally reserves the right, mentally or avowedly, of\r\n_appealing_ from the decision of the boys to the teacher or his father, in\r\ncase he feels that he has been unjustly dealt with.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the principal elements of the courts of today, the\r\nestablishment of justice as a public trust, the determination of the facts\r\nby means of witnesses and a jury, the application of the law by one or\r\nmore judges, the right of appeal to a higher court, are not artificial,\r\nbut in the nature of things. We inherited them from our primitive\r\nancestors, and in that sense they may be said to have been imposed upon\r\nus. But their naturalness appears in the fact that boys when left to\r\nthemselves introduce the same elements into their boy-courts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES MADE IN COURSE OF TIME.\r\n\r\nIn the Jury System.--The jurors were originally, as has been said, persons\r\nacquainted with the facts. After the Norman conquest, it came about that\r\nthe jury consisted of twelve persons disinterested and _unacquainted_ with\r\nthe facts. Probably the change gradually came about from the difficulty of\r\ngetting twelve men eligible to the jury who knew of the facts. Persons\r\nineligible to the jury were then invited to give it information, but not\r\nto join it in the verdict. The next step, taken about 1400 A.D., was to\r\nrequire these witnesses to give their evidence in open court, subject to\r\nexamination and cross-examination. The testimony of the witnesses,\r\nhowever, was still merely supplementary. Then in the time of Queen Anne,\r\nabout 1707 A.D., it was decided that any person who had knowledge of the\r\nfacts of the case should appear as a _witness_, that the jury should\r\nconsist of persons unacquainted with the facts, and that the verdict\r\nshould be rendered in accordance with the evidence. And so it is to this\r\nday, both in England and America. [Footnote: The best history of the jury\r\nsystem is probably Forsyth's.]\r\n\r\n\"It is not true, however, that a man is disqualified from serving on a\r\njury simply because he has heard or read of the case, and has formed and\r\nexpressed some impression in regard to its merits; if it were, the\r\nqualifications for jury service in cases that attract great attention\r\nwould be ignorance and stupidity. The test, therefore, is not whether the\r\njuryman is entirely ignorant of the case, but whether he has formed such\r\nan opinion as would be likely to prevent him from impartially weighing the\r\nevidence and returning a verdict in accordance therewith.\" [Footnote:\r\nDole's Talks about Law, p. 59.]\r\n\r\nIn the Officers.--As has been said, there were in the old Saxon courts no\r\ncourt officers. But quite early the necessity for such officers became\r\nmanifest. And several of the offices then established have come down to\r\nus. Some of them, however, have been so modified in the progress of time\r\nas to be hardly recognizable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS IN A JUSTICE COURT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. IN ORDINARY CIVIL ACTIONS.\r\n\r\nDefinitions.--A _Civil Action_ is one having for its object the protection\r\nor enforcement of a private right or the securing of compensation for an\r\ninfraction thereof. For instance a suit brought to secure possession of a\r\nhorse, or to secure damages for a trespass is a civil action. The person\r\nbringing the action is called the _plaintiff_; the one against whom it is\r\nbrought, the _defendant_. The plaintiff and the defendant are called the\r\n_parties_ to the action.\r\n\r\n_Jurisdiction._--A justice of the peace has jurisdiction within the county\r\nin most civil actions when the amount in controversy does not exceed a\r\ncertain sum, usually one hundred dollars. (See p. 296.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY TO TRIAL.\r\n\r\n_Complaint and Summons._--In bringing a civil action, the plaintiff or his\r\nagent appears before the justice of the peace and files a Complaint. In\r\nthis he states the cause of the action. The justice then issues a Summons.\r\nThis is an order to a sheriff or constable commanding him to notify the\r\ndefendant to appear before the justice at a certain time and place to make\r\nanswer to the plaintiff's demands. (Form on p. 277.)\r\n\r\nSometimes on bringing an action or during its progress a writ of\r\nattachment is obtained. To secure this writ, the creditor must make\r\naffidavit to the fact of the debt, and that the debtor is disposing or\r\npreparing to dispose of his property with intent to defraud him, or that\r\nthe debtor is himself not reachable, because hiding or because of\r\nnon-residence. In addition, the creditor must give a bond for the costs of\r\nthe suit, and for any damages sustained by the defendant. The justice then\r\nissues the writ, which commands the sheriff or constable to take\r\npossession of and hold sufficient goods of the debtor and summon him as\r\ndefendant in the suit.\r\n\r\nAnother writ sometimes used is the writ of replevin. To secure this writ,\r\nthe plaintiff must make affidavit that the defendant is in wrongful\r\npossession of certain (described) personal property belonging to the\r\nplaintiff. The plaintiff then gives a bond for the costs of the suit and\r\nfor the return of the property in case he fails to secure judgment, and\r\nfor the payment of damages if the return of the property cannot be\r\nenforced, and the justice issues the writ. This commands the sheriff or\r\nconstable to take the property described and turn it over to the\r\nplaintiff, and to summon the defendant as before.\r\n\r\nPleadings.--The next step in the process, in any of the cases, is the\r\nfiling of an Answer by the defendant, in which he states the grounds of\r\nhis defense. The complaint of the plaintiff and the answer of the\r\ndefendant constitute what are called the pleadings. [Footnote: For a more\r\nextensive discussion of pleadings, see chapter VII.; or Dole, pp. 30-42.]\r\nIf the answer contains a counter-claim, the plaintiff is entitled to a\r\nfurther pleading called the Reply. The pleadings contain simply a\r\nstatement of the facts upon which the parties rely in support of their\r\ncase. No evidence, inference or argument is permitted in them.\r\n\r\nIssue.--It is a principle of pleading that \"everything not denied is\r\npresumed to be admitted.\" The fact or facts asserted by one party and\r\ndenied by the other constitute the issue. If the defendant does not make\r\nanswer on or before the day appointed in the summons and does not appear\r\non that day, judgment may be rendered against him. If the plaintiff fail\r\nto appear, he loses the suit and has to pay the costs. For sufficient\r\ncause either party may have the suit adjourned or postponed for a short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nJury.--On demand of either party a jury must be impaneled. The jury\r\nusually consists of twelve persons, but by consent of the parties the\r\nnumber may be less. The jury is impaneled as follows: The justice directs\r\nthe sheriff or constable to make a list of twenty-four inhabitants of the\r\ncounty qualified to serve as jurors in the district court, or of eighteen\r\nif the jury is to consist of six persons. Each party may then strike out\r\nsix of the names. The justice then issues a venire [Footnote: For forms,\r\nsee page 280.] to the sheriff or a constable, directing him to summon the\r\npersons whose names remain on the list to act as jurors.\r\n\r\nWitnesses.--If any of the witnesses should be unwilling to come, the\r\njustice issues a subpoena [Footnote: For forms, see page 279.] commanding\r\nthem to appear. The subpoena may contain any number of names and may be\r\nserved by any one. It is \"served\" by reading it to the person named\r\ntherein, or by delivering a copy of it to him. A witness, however, is not\r\nbound to come unless paid mileage and one day's service in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL.\r\n\r\nOpening Statement.--The usual procedure is as follows: After the jury has\r\nbeen sworn, the plaintiff's attorney reads the complaint and makes an\r\nopening statement of the facts which he expects to prove. The purpose of\r\nthe opening statement is to present the salient points of the case, so\r\nthat the importance and bearing of the testimony may be readily seen by\r\nthe jury.\r\n\r\nEvidence.--The evidence [Footnote: The most important Rules of Evidence\r\nare given in chapter VII.] for the plaintiff is then introduced. Each\r\nwitness, after being duly sworn, gives his testimony by answering the\r\nquestions of counsel. After the direct examination by the plaintiff's\r\nattorney, the witness may be cross-examined by the attorney for the\r\ndefendant. When the evidence for the plaintiff is all in, the defendant's\r\nattorney makes his opening statement, and then the witnesses for the\r\ndefense are examined. The direct examination is now, of course, conducted\r\nby the counsel for the defendant, and the cross-examination by opposing\r\ncounsel. When all the evidence for the defense has been introduced, the\r\nplaintiff may offer evidence in \"rebuttal,\" that is, to contradict or\r\ndisprove new matter adduced by the defense. And the defendant may then\r\nintroduce evidence to refute matter first brought out by the rebuttal.\r\n\r\nArgument.--The case is now ready for \"argument.\" One attorney on each side\r\naddresses the jury. Each tries to show that the evidence adduced has\r\nproved the facts alleged in his pleadings, and each asks for a decision in\r\nfavor of his client. Usually the side upon which rests the burden of proof\r\nhas the closing argument.\r\n\r\nCounsel must confine themselves to the law, the admitted facts and the\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nVerdict.--The jury then retire in care of an officer to a room set apart\r\nfor their use. Here they deliberate in secret. If after a reasonable time\r\nthey cannot agree, they are discharged, and the case stands as if no trial\r\nhad taken place. But if they agree they return to the court room and\r\nrender their verdict. This is given by the foreman, and is assented to by\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nJudgment.--After the verdict, the justice enters judgment in accordance\r\ntherewith. Judgment may include certain sums of money allowed to the\r\nsuccessful party in part compensation of his expenses. Such allowances and\r\ncertain court expenses are called \"the costs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE TRIAL.\r\n\r\nAppeal.--If the defeated party feels that he has not been justly dealt\r\nwith, he may ask for a new trial. If this be refused he may appeal his\r\ncase to a higher court. He must make affidavit that the appeal is not\r\ntaken for the purpose of delay, and must give bonds to cover the judgment\r\nand the costs of appeal. The higher court affirms or reverses the\r\njudgment, in the latter case granting a new trial.\r\n\r\nSometimes the case is tried anew in the higher court, just as if there had\r\nbeen no trial in the justice court.\r\n\r\nExecution.--If no appeal is taken the defeated party may \"satisfy\" the\r\njudgment, that is, pay to the justice the sum specified therein. If at the\r\nexpiration of the time allowed for appeal the judgment remains\r\nunsatisfied, the justice may issue an execution [Footnote: For forms, see\r\nAppendix, pp. 282-3.] against the property of the debtor.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. IN CRIMINAL ACTIONS.\r\n\r\n_Jurisdiction._\r\n\r\nJustices of the peace have jurisdiction throughout their respective\r\ncounties, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _To try_ charges where the punishment prescribed by law does not exceed\r\na fine of one hundred dollars or imprisonment for three months. [Footnote:\r\nThe extent of this jurisdiction varies somewhat in different states.]\r\n\r\n2. _To examine_ persons charged with crimes greater than those specified\r\nabove, and to dismiss them or hold them for trial in a court having\r\njurisdiction, as the facts seem to warrant.\r\n\r\n3. _To prevent_ crimes, by requiring reckless persons to give security to\r\nkeep the peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS IN CRIMINAL TRIAL.\r\n\r\nPreliminary.\r\n\r\nComplaint.--If a crime has been committed, the sufferer, or any one else,\r\nmay appear before the justice of the peace and make complaint, under oath,\r\nspecifying the nature of the crime, the time of its commission, and the\r\nname of the person believed to have perpetrated it, and requesting that he\r\nbe apprehended for trial.\r\n\r\nWarrant.--If upon careful examination of the complainant and any witnesses\r\nwhom he may bring, it appears that the offense has probably been\r\ncommitted, the justice issues a warrant, reciting the substance of the\r\ncomplaint, and commanding an officer to arrest the accused and produce him\r\nfor trial.\r\n\r\nReturn.--The officer arrests the accused, brings him before the justice,\r\nand makes a return of the warrant. The return is a statement on the back\r\nof the warrant telling how its commands have been executed. (See p. 283)\r\n\r\nBail.--The accused is entitled to a speedy trial. But if for good cause it\r\nseems best to postpone it, the accused may be released from custody upon\r\ngiving sufficient bail for his appearance at the time fixed for trial. If\r\nhe cannot furnish bail, he is committed to jail or left in charge of the\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nSubpoena.--One good reason for postponing a trial is to enable the parties\r\nto secure witnesses. To this end, the justice issues subpoenas. But in\r\nthis case the witnesses must come without the tender of the fee.\r\n\r\n_The Trial._\r\n\r\nArraignment.--The first step in the trial proper is to inform the\r\ndefendant of the nature of the crime with which he is charged. The\r\naccusation, as stated in the warrant, is distinctly read to him by the\r\njustice, and he is required to plead thereto. If he pleads guilty,\r\nconviction and sentence may follow at once. If he pleads not guilty, the\r\ntrial proceeds.\r\n\r\nTrial.--After the joining of issue, and before the court proceeds to the\r\nexamination of the merits of the case, a jury is impaneled as in a civil\r\naction. A jury may be waived by the defendant. Then follow the taking of\r\nthe testimony, the arguments of counsel, the consideration and verdict by\r\nthe jury. The defendant is then discharged if not guilty, or sentenced if\r\nfound guilty. The penalty depends, of course, upon the nature of the\r\noffense.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS IN EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nNeed of Examination.--Over crimes punishable by fine greater than $100 or\r\nimprisonment for more than three months, a justice of the peace usually\r\nhas no jurisdiction of trial. The action must be tried in the district\r\ncourt, on the indictment of a grand jury. But in the meantime the\r\nperpetrator of a crime might escape. To prevent this, the accused may be\r\narrested and examined by a justice of the peace, to ascertain whether or\r\nnot there are sufficient grounds for holding him for trial.\r\n\r\nProceedings.--The preliminary proceedings are precisely like those in case\r\nof a trial. Upon complaint duly made a warrant is issued, and the accused\r\nis arrested and brought before the justice. In the presence of the\r\naccused, the magistrate examines the complainant and witnesses in support\r\nof the prosecution, upon oath, \"in relation to any matter connected with\r\nsuch charge which may be deemed pertinent.\"\r\n\r\nRights of Accused.--The accused has a right to have witnesses in his\r\nbehalf, and to have the aid of counsel, who may cross-examine the\r\nwitnesses for the prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe Result.--If it appears upon examination that the accused is innocent\r\nof the crime, he is discharged. If his guilt seems probable, he is held to\r\nawait the action of the grand jury. In the case of some offenses bail may\r\nbe accepted. But if no suitable bail is offered, or if the offense is not\r\nbailable, the accused is committed to jail. Material witnesses for the\r\nprosecution may be required to give bonds for their appearance at the\r\ntrial, or in default thereof may be committed to jail.\r\n\r\nReports.--The justice makes a report of the proceedings in the\r\nexamination, and files it with the clerk of the court before which the\r\naccused is bound to appear for trial.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS FOR PREVENTING CRIME.\r\n\r\nPrefatory.--But it is better to prevent crime than to punish it. Indeed,\r\none reason for punishing wrongdoers is that the fear of punishment may\r\ndeter people from committing crime.\r\n\r\nProceedings.--As a conservator of the public peace, then, a justice may\r\nrequire persons to give bonds for good behavior. The preliminary\r\nproceedings are similar to those in the case of a trial--the complaint,\r\nwarrant and return. But the complainant simply alleges upon oath, that a\r\ncrime against his person or property has been threatened. The examination\r\nis conducted as in case of a criminal offense.\r\n\r\nResult.--If upon examination there appears reason to fear that the crime\r\nwill be committed by the party complained of, he shall be required to\r\nenter into recognizance to keep the peace, failing in which he shall be\r\ncommitted to jail for the time to be covered by the surety, said time not\r\nto exceed six months.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON CRIMINAL TRIALS.\r\n\r\nThe care for the rights of the accused is based upon the principle in our\r\nlaw, that every man shall be held innocent till _proved_ guilty. Another\r\nprinciple is that a person accused of crime _cannot be tried in his\r\nabsence._ The purpose of arresting him is to secure his _presence_ at the\r\ntrial. If he can guarantee this by bail he is set at liberty, otherwise he\r\nis confined in jail. (See p. 231.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nAre the justices and constables town, county or state officers? How is it\r\nknown at the county seat who the justices and constables in each town are?\r\nDefine docket, summons, warrant, pleading, subpoena, crime, felony,\r\nmisdemeanor, venire, costs, execution, recognizance. Why are there two\r\njustices in each town? What is meant by \"change of venue?\" How is an oath\r\nadministered in court? What persons may not serve as witnesses? If a\r\ncriminal should make confession of the crime to his lawyer, could the\r\nlawyer be subpoenaed as a witness on the trial? Name some things \"exempt\r\nfrom execution\" in this state. What is to hinder a bitter enemy of yours,\r\nif you have one, from having you committed to prison. Can a _civil_ suit\r\nproceed in the absence of the defendant?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Practical Work._\r\n\r\nAssume that John Smith bought from Reuben White a cow, the price agreed\r\nupon being $30; that Smith refuses to pay, and White sues him. Write up\r\nall the papers in the case, make proper entries in the docket, assessing\r\ncosts, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE INCORPORATED VILLAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeed of.--Owing to conditions, natural and artificial, favorable to\r\nbusiness enterprises, people group together in certain places. Living in a\r\nlimited area, the amount of land occupied by each family is small, and the\r\nterritory is surveyed into lots and blocks. To make each homestead\r\naccessible, streets are laid out. The distances traveled being short,\r\npeople go about principally on foot; hence the need of sidewalks. To\r\nreduce the danger of going about after dark, street-lamps are needed. The\r\nnearness of the houses to each other renders it necessary to take special\r\nprecautions for the prevention of fires, and for their extinguishment in\r\ncase they break out.\r\n\r\nBut to provide and maintain all these things takes money, and the people\r\nliving in the other parts of the town not sharing the benefits would\r\nhardly like to help pay for them. Hence it is but just that the people\r\nliving in the thickly settled portion of the town should be permitted to\r\nseparate from the rest and form an organization by themselves.\r\n\r\nAgain, the circumstances being different, the regulations must be\r\ndifferent in this part of the town. For instance, in the country a man may\r\ndrive as fast as he pleases, while here fast driving endangers life and\r\nmust be prohibited. In the country sleigh-bells are not needed, while here\r\nthey must be used to warn people of the approach of teams. In the country,\r\nif a man's house takes fire no other person's property is endangered; but\r\nhere the danger is such that all the people are interested in each man's\r\nhouse, and the community may require that chimneys be properly constructed\r\nand ashes safely disposed of.\r\n\r\nHow Incorporated.--Villages are, with rare exceptions, incorporated under\r\na general law specifying the number of inhabitants, the mode of voting on\r\nincorporation, etc.\r\n\r\nThe method in Minnesota, which may be taken as typical, is as follows:\r\nUpon petition of thirty or more voters resident upon the lands to be\r\nincorporated, which lands have been divided into lots and blocks, the\r\ncounty commissioners appoint a time, and give due notice thereof, when the\r\nvoters \"actually residing within the territory described,\" may vote upon\r\nthe question. If a majority of those voting favor incorporation, the\r\ncommissioners file with the register of deeds the original petition, a\r\ntrue copy of the notice of election, and the certificate showing the\r\nresult of the vote. The village thus becomes incorporated, and has the\r\nusual corporate powers. It organizes by electing officers.\r\n\r\nElective Officers.--The usual elective officers of a village are a\r\npresident, three trustees, a treasurer, and a recorder, who are chosen for\r\none year, and two justices of the peace and a constable, elected for two\r\nyears. [Footnote: The difference in term is accounted for by the fact that\r\nthe justices and constables are in a measure county officers.]\r\n\r\nThe Council and Its Powers.--The president, the three trustees, and the\r\nrecorder constitute the village council. They may make, for the following\r\npurposes among others, such ordinances or by-laws as they deem necessary:\r\n\r\n1. To establish and regulate a fire department; to purchase apparatus for\r\nextinguishing fires; to construct water-works; to designate limits within\r\nwhich wooden buildings shall not be erected; to regulate the manner of\r\nbuilding and cleaning chimneys, and of disposing of ashes; and generally\r\nto enact such necessary measures for the prevention or extinguishment of\r\nfires as may be proper.\r\n\r\n2. To lay out streets, alleys, parks, and other public grounds; to grade,\r\nimprove, or discontinue them; to make, repair, improve, or discontinue\r\nsidewalks, and to prevent their being encumbered with merchandise, snow or\r\nother obstructions; to regulate driving on the streets; to appoint a\r\nstreet commissioner.\r\n\r\n3. To erect lamp-posts and lamps, and provide for the care and lighting of\r\nthe lamps.\r\n\r\n4. To appoint a board of health, with due powers; to provide public\r\nhospitals; to regulate slaughter-houses; to define, prevent, and abate\r\nnuisances.\r\n\r\n5. To establish and maintain a public library and reading-room.\r\n\r\n6. To prohibit gambling; to prevent, or license and regulate the sale of\r\nliquor, the keeping of billiard-tables, and the exhibition of circuses and\r\nshows of all kinds; to appoint policemen, and provide a place of\r\nconfinement for offenders against the ordinances.\r\n\r\n7. In general, \"to ordain and establish all such ordinances and by-laws\r\nfor the government and good order of the village, the suppression of vice\r\nand immorality, the prevention of crime, the protection of public and\r\nprivate property, the benefit of trade and commerce, and the promotion of\r\nhealth, not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates or of this state, as they shall deem expedient,\" and to provide\r\npenalties for the violation of the ordinances.\r\n\r\nAll fines and penalties imposed belong to the village.\r\n\r\nAppointive Officers.--The council appoints, as provided by law, a village\r\nattorney, a poundmaster, one or more keepers of cemeteries, one or more\r\nfire-wardens, and regular and special policemen; and it prescribes the\r\nduties and fixes the compensation of these officers. The council also\r\nelects at its first meeting, a village assessor, who shall hold his office\r\none year.\r\n\r\nVacancies and Removals.--Vacancies in any of the village offices are\r\nfilled by the council, and it has power to remove any officer elected or\r\nappointed by it whenever it seems that the public welfare will be promoted\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nLike Town Officers.--The assessor, treasurer, justices of the peace, and\r\nconstable, have the same duties and responsibilities as the corresponding\r\nofficers in the town. The village has a seal, of which the recorder is the\r\ncustodian; and he is, as has been said, a member of the council. Otherwise\r\nthe duties of the recorder are similar to those of the town clerk.\r\n\r\nElections.--A village usually constitutes one election district and one\r\nroad district. Village elections are conducted as are those in a town.\r\n\r\nEnlargements.--Lands adjoining the village may be annexed to it, at the\r\nwish and with the consent of the voters of the territory and of the\r\nvillage. The will of the voters aforesaid is expressed at an election\r\ncalled, after due notice, by the county commissioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nName the incorporated villages in your county. Any others that you know.\r\nName some villages, so-called, which are not incorporated. Why are the\r\npetition and other papers of incorporation recorded?\r\n\r\nCan a person living in a village build a sidewalk to suit his own fancy?\r\nWhy? Suppose that owing to a defective sidewalk you should break your leg,\r\nwhat responsibility would lie on the village?\r\n\r\nHow would you get your pay if you had a bill against a village?\r\n\r\nThe village council has power \"to establish and regulate markets.\" Why\r\nshould the sale of meats be regulated any more than the sale of flour or\r\nof clothing? May the sale of bread be regulated?\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between a policeman and a constable.\r\n\r\nCompare the village and the town, telling wherein they are alike and\r\nwherein they are different.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Debate_.\r\n\r\nResolved, That for a village of 1000 inhabitants or less it is wise not to\r\nbecome incorporated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeed Of.--A village being one election district has only one polling\r\nplace. The community may increase so in numbers as to make it necessary to\r\nhave several voting places. For the accommodation of the people, these\r\nwould naturally be located in different parts of the community; and to\r\nprevent fraud, voting precincts would have to be carefully defined. The\r\ncouncil would naturally be made up of representatives from these\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nWhen, under this arrangement, the voters assemble in different parts of\r\nthe community, they could not listen to financial reports and vote taxes,\r\nas they do in the town and the village. Hence it would be necessary to\r\nendow the council with increased powers, including the power to levy taxes\r\nwithout the direct authorization of the people.\r\n\r\nThe expenses for public improvements, for waterworks, sewers,\r\nstreet-lighting, etc., may take more money than it would be prudent to\r\nassess upon the community for immediate payment. In this case it would be\r\ndesirable for the community to have the power to issue bonds.\r\n\r\nAgain, with increase in population there is an increase in the number of\r\ndisputes over private rights, and temptations to crime become more\r\nnumerous. Hence the need of one or more courts having jurisdiction greater\r\nthan that possessed by justices of the peace. The conditions necessitate\r\nalso an increase in the number and the efficiency of the police. And to\r\nrender the police efficient it is necessary that they be under the\r\ndirection of one man, the same one who is responsible for the carrying out\r\nof the ordinances of the council, namely, the mayor.\r\n\r\nA community organized to comply with the foregoing requirements--divided\r\ninto wards, having a council made up of aldermen from those wards, having\r\na council authorized to levy taxes at its discretion, having a municipal\r\ncourt, having regularly employed police acting under the direction of the\r\nmayor--is a city, as the term is generally used in the United States.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for establishing a city government is frequently potent,\r\nalthough unmentioned. The pride of the community can be thereby indulged,\r\nand more citizens can have their ambition to hold public office gratified.\r\n\r\nHow Organized.--A city may be organized under general law or special\r\ncharter from the legislature. Large cities, and small ones with _great\r\nexpectations_, usually work under a charter. But the custom is growing of\r\norganizing cities at first under general law. Then if a city outgrows the\r\ngeneral law, grows so that it needs powers and privileges not granted\r\ntherein, it may properly ask the legislature for a special charter.\r\n\r\nAs a type, the principal provisions of the general law of Minnesota are\r\nhere given, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Whenever the legal voters residing within the limits of a territory\r\ncomprising not less than two thousand inhabitants, and not more than\r\nfifteen thousand, and which territory they wish to have incorporated as a\r\ncity, shall sign and have presented to the judge of probate of the county\r\nin which such territory is situated, a petition setting forth the metes\r\nand bounds of said city, and of the several wards thereof, and praying\r\nthat said city shall be incorporated under such name as may therein be\r\ndesignated, the judge of probate shall issue an order declaring such\r\nterritory duly incorporated as a city, and shall designate the metes,\r\nbounds, wards, and name thereof, as in said petition described.\" And the\r\njudge of probate designates the time and places of holding the first\r\nelection, giving due notice thereof. He also appoints three persons in\r\neach ward, of which there shall be not less than two nor more than five,\r\nto act as judges of election. The corporation is established upon the\r\npresentation of the petition, and the organization is completed by the\r\nelection of officers.\r\n\r\nThe usual elective officers of a city are a mayor, a treasurer, a\r\nrecorder, one justice of the peace for each ward, styled \"city justice,\"\r\nall of whom shall be qualified voters of the city, and one or more\r\naldermen for each ward, who shall be \"qualified voters therein.\" All other\r\ncity officers are appointed.\r\n\r\nThe term of mayor, city justices and aldermen is in most states two years;\r\nthat of the other officers, one year.\r\n\r\nAny officer of the city may be removed from office by vote of two-thirds\r\nof the whole number of aldermen. But an elective officer must be given \"an\r\nopportunity to be heard in his own defense.\"\r\n\r\nA vacancy in the office of mayor or alderman is filled by a new election.\r\nA vacancy in any other office is filled by appointment. The person elected\r\nor appointed serves for the unexpired term.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor is the chief executive officer and head of the police of the\r\ncity. By and with the consent of the council, he appoints a chief of\r\npolice and other police officers and watchmen. In case of disturbance he\r\nmay appoint as many special constables as he may think necessary, and he\r\nmay discharge them whenever he thinks their services no longer needed.\r\n\r\nThe City Council consists of the aldermen. [Footnote: In some states the\r\ncity council consists of two bodies.] It is the judge of the election of\r\nits own members. A majority of the members elected constitutes a quorum\r\nfor the transaction of business.\r\n\r\nThe council chooses its own president and vice-president. In case the\r\nmayor is absent from the city or for any reason is temporarily unable to\r\nact, the president of the council acts as mayor, with the title Acting\r\nMayor.\r\n\r\nPassing Ordinances.--The mode of passing an ordinance is unlike anything\r\nthat we have considered up to this time, and deserves special attention on\r\naccount of its resemblance to the mode of making laws in the state and\r\ngeneral governments. It is as follows. If a proposed ordinance is voted\r\nfor by a majority of the members of the council present at any meeting, it\r\nis presented to the mayor. If he approves it, he signs it, and it becomes\r\nan ordinance. But if he does not approve it, he returns it, through the\r\nrecorder, to the council, together with his objections. [Footnote: This is\r\ncalled _vetoing_ it, from a Latin word _veto_, meaning _I forbid_.]The\r\ncouncil, then reconsiders the proposed ordinance in the light of the\r\nmayor's objections. If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of the\r\nmembers elected vote for it, it becomes an ordinance, just as if approved\r\nby the mayor. \"If an ordinance or resolution shall not be returned by the\r\nmayor within five days, Sundays excepted, after it shall have been\r\npresented to him,\" it shall have the same effect as if approved by him.\r\n\r\nPublication of Ordinances.--The ordinances and by-laws of the council are\r\npublished in a newspaper of the city, selected by the council as the\r\nofficial means of publication, and are posted in three conspicuous places\r\nin each ward for two weeks, before they become operative.\r\n\r\nCouncil Powers.--The city council has about the same powers as a village\r\ncouncil in regard to streets, the prevention and extinguishment of fires,\r\netc.--the same in kind but somewhat more extensive. But it can also levy\r\ntaxes for public purposes, as has before been said. It usually elects the\r\nassessor, the city attorney, the street commissioner, and a city surveyor,\r\nand in some states other officers.\r\n\r\nThe recorder, treasurer, assessor, justices of the peace, and police\r\nconstables, have duties similar to those of the corresponding officers in\r\na village or a town.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Pertinent Questions_.\r\n\r\nIf two persons should claim the same seat in the city council, who would\r\ndecide the matter?\r\n\r\nState three ways in which a proposed ordinance may become an ordinance.\r\nTwo ways in which it may fail. How can persons living in a city find out\r\nwhat ordinances the council passes? How far are the ordinances of any city\r\noperative?\r\n\r\nCompare the government of a village with that of a city.\r\n\r\nAre school affairs managed by the city council? How is it in a village? In\r\na town.\r\n\r\nIf a new school-house is needed in a city, and there is not money enough\r\nin the treasury to build it, what can be done?\r\n\r\nIf you live in a city having a special charter, borrow a copy of it from a\r\nlawyer or from the city recorder, and find out what powers and privileges\r\nare granted to the corporation not specified in the general law; what\r\nlimitations are imposed; and, if a municipal court is provided for, what\r\nits jurisdiction is in civil actions and in criminal prosecutions.\r\n\r\nName the principal officers in your city. The aldermen from your ward.\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the dangers of city government? Consult Macy's Our\r\nGovernment, pp. 51-53, and Nordhoff's Politics for Young Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Questions for Debate._\r\n\r\nResolved, That for a community of 5000 inhabitants or less a village\r\norganization is better than a city organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeed Of.--A county organization is needed for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. _To establish the lower organizations_. As we have seen, the\r\norganizations within the county are established by county officers. But,\r\nit may properly be asked, why not have them organized by the state\r\ndirectly? There are at least three good reasons: In the first place, it\r\nwould be too burdensome to the state; that is, the state would act through\r\nthe legislature, and to organize all the individual school districts,\r\ntowns, villages, and cities, would take up too much of the time of the\r\nlegislature. In the second place, the organizing could only be done at\r\ncertain times, namely during the session of the legislature, and in the\r\nmeantime communities would have to wait. In the third place, the records\r\nof incorporation would be inaccessible in case they were needed for\r\nreference.\r\n\r\n2. _To serve as a medium between the state and the lower organizations._\r\nThe state uses the town, village, and city to value property for purposes\r\nof taxation and as election districts. But it gets its taxes and its\r\nelection returns through the county. Here again may arise the question,\r\nwhy not send the state taxes directly to the capital and make election\r\nreturns directly also? At least two good reasons appear: It would increase\r\nthe work and therefore the number of officials at the capital, and if a\r\nmistake should be made it could not be so easily discovered and corrected.\r\n\r\n3. _To carry on public works beyond the power of the towns individually._\r\nA desired local improvement may be beyond the power of a town either\r\nbecause it is outside of the jurisdiction of the town or because of its\r\nexpense. Thus, a road may be needed between two centers of population,\r\nvillages or cities, which would run through several towns, while the\r\njurisdiction of the towns individually extends only to their own borders.\r\nOr a bridge over a wide stream may be needed, which would be too expensive\r\nfor the town in which it is located. The road and the bridge would better\r\nbe provided by the county.[Footnote: Sometimes state aid is secured. Do\r\nyou think it wise, as a rule, for the state to grant such aid?] And the\r\npoor can generally be better cared for by the county than by the\r\nindividual towns, for the county can erect and maintain a poor-house.\r\n\r\n4. _To secure certain local officers not needed in every town;_ for\r\ninstance, a register of deeds, the coroner, the judge of probate, the\r\nsuperintendent of schools (in most states), and the surveyor.\r\n\r\n5. _To serve as a territorial basis for the apportionment of members of\r\nthe legislature._ This is, perhaps, merely an incidental gain. But its\r\nconvenience in defining legislative districts is obvious.\r\n\r\n6. _To make justice cheap and accessible._ It is well in many ways, as we\r\nhave seen, to have in every town, village, and city, courts of limited\r\njurisdiction. But to _establish justice_ in any generous or satisfying\r\nsense there should be within the reach of every citizen a court competent\r\nto try _any_ difference between individuals regardless of the amount in\r\ncontroversy, and able to punish any crime against the laws of the state.\r\nTo bring such a court within the reach of every one was the original\r\nreason for the establishment of the county, and remains today the greatest\r\nadvantage derived from its existence.\r\n\r\nEstablishment.--Counties are established by the state legislature.\r\n\r\nIn thinly settled parts of a state the counties are much larger than in\r\nthe populous parts. A county should be large enough to make its\r\nadministration economical, and yet small enough to bring its seat of\r\njustice within easy reach of every one within its boundaries. In the ideal\r\ncounty a person living in any part thereof can go to the county seat by\r\nteam, have several hours for business, and return home the same day.\r\n\r\nCounty Board.--The administration of county affairs is in the hands of the\r\ncounty commissioners or supervisors. This board is usually constructed on\r\none of two plans: Either it consists of three or five members, the county\r\nbeing divided into commissioner districts; or else it is constituted of\r\nthe chairmen or other member of each of the several town boards. The\r\nformer plan prevails in Minnesota, Iowa, and other states; the latter in\r\nWisconsin, Michigan, most of Illinois, and in other states.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners have charge of county roads and bridges, county\r\nbuildings and other county property, and the care of the county poor.\r\nThrough the commissioners the county exercises the usual corporate powers.\r\n\r\nRecording Officer.--The recording officer of the county is called in some\r\nstates the county auditor, in others the recorder, and in others the\r\ncounty clerk. As we would expect, he is secretary of the board of\r\ncommissioners and the custodian of county papers; and all orders upon the\r\ntreasurer are issued by him. The auditor is also bookkeeper for the\r\ncounty, that is, he keeps an account of the money received and paid out by\r\nthe county treasurer.\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota and some other states, he computes all the taxes for the\r\ncounty, [Footnote: In some states, among them Wisconsin, this computation\r\nis performed by the several town clerks, and the moneys are collected by\r\nthe town treasurers.] and makes the tax-lists, showing in books provided\r\nfor the purpose just how much the tax is on each piece of real estate and\r\non personal property. These books he turns over to the county treasurer to\r\nbe used in collecting the taxes.\r\n\r\nTreasurer.--The county treasurer is, in some states, one of the most\r\nimportant officers. He is the great financial agent, collecting all the\r\ntaxes paid by the people for school, town, village, city, county and state\r\npurposes, except assessments for city sidewalks and street grading. Great\r\ncare must, therefore, be taken to guard the public money. The precautions\r\nserve as a check upon weak or dishonest officials, while right-minded ones\r\nwelcome them as keeping their good name above suspicion. As a type, the\r\nprecautions taken in Minnesota are given, to-wit:\r\n\r\n1. The selection of an honest man for the office, so far as possible, is a\r\nprime consideration.\r\n\r\n2. The treasurer must give a bond for such amount as the county\r\ncommissioners direct.\r\n\r\n3. He shall pay out money only upon the order of proper authority.\r\n[Footnote: Moneys belonging to school district, town, village, or city,\r\nare paid on the warrant of the county auditor; county money, on the order\r\nof the county commissioners, signed by the chairman and attested by the\r\ncounty auditor; state money, on the draft of the state auditor in favor of\r\nthe state treasurer.] This order signed by the payee is the treasurer's\r\nreceipt or voucher.\r\n\r\n4. He shall keep his books so as to show the amount received and paid on\r\naccount of separate and distinct funds or appropriations, which he shall\r\nexhibit in separate accounts.\r\n\r\n5. The books must be balanced at the close of each day.\r\n\r\n6. When any money is paid to the county treasurer, excepting that paid on\r\ntaxes charged on duplicate, the treasurer shall give, to the person paying\r\nthe same, duplicate receipts therefor, one of which such persons shall\r\nforthwith deposit with the county auditor, in order that the county\r\ntreasurer may be charged with the amount thereof.\r\n\r\n7. The county auditor, the chairman of the board of county commissioners,\r\nand the clerk of the district court, acting as an auditing board,\r\ncarefully examine at least three times a year the accounts, books and\r\nvouchers of the county treasurer, and count the money in the treasury.\r\n\r\n8. The state examiner makes a similar examination at least once a year. No\r\nnotice is given in either case.\r\n\r\n9. As security against robbers, the money in the possession of the county\r\ntreasurer must be deposited on or before the first of every month in one\r\nor more banks. The banks are designated by the auditing board, and must\r\ngive bonds for twice the amount to be deposited.\r\n\r\nRegister of Deeds.--Without hope of reward no one would work. To encourage\r\nfrugality, people must be reasonably secure in the possession of their\r\nsavings. One of the things for which a person strives is a home.\r\nTherefore, great care is taken to render a person who has bought a home,\r\nor other landed property, secure in its possession. Among the means\r\nemployed are these: 1. The purchaser is given a written title to the land.\r\nThis is called a _deed_. 2. In order that any person may find out who owns\r\nthe land, thus preventing a person reputed to own it from selling it, or\r\nthe owner from selling to several persons, a _copy_ of the deed is made by\r\na competent and responsible public officer in a book which is kept for\r\nthat purpose and which is open to public inspection. This is called\r\n_registering_ the deed, and the officer is called the register of deeds.\r\n[Footnote: Incidentally this officer records other instruments, such as\r\nofficial bonds, official oaths, etc.] The register may have assistants, if\r\nnecessary, he being responsible for their work.\r\n\r\nJudge of Probate.--But not only should a person enjoy the fruit of his\r\nlabors while living, he should also be able to feel that at his death his\r\nproperty shall descend to his family or others whom he loves. Many persons\r\nbefore they die make a written statement, telling how they wish their\r\nproperty disposed of. This written statement is called a will or\r\ntestament. Some who are possessed of property die without making a will.\r\nThey are said to die _intestate_. To see that the provisions of wills, if\r\nany be made, are complied with, and, in case no will is made, to make sure\r\nthat the property comes into possession of those best entitled to it, is\r\nthe important and wellnigh sacred duty of an officer called the judge of\r\nprobate. If no one is named in the will to look after the education and\r\nproperty of minor heirs, the judge of probate may appoint a guardian. The\r\nappointee must give bonds for the faithful discharge of his duty.\r\n[Footnote: see chapter VII.] Incidentally it is made the duty of the judge\r\nof probate to appoint guardians for any persons needing them, such as\r\ninsane persons, spendthrifts, and the like. He seems to be the friend of\r\nthe weak.\r\n\r\nCounty Surveyor.--To survey all public improvements for the county, such\r\nas roads, lands for public buildings, &c., there is an officer called the\r\ncounty surveyor. He is required to preserve his \"field notes\" in county\r\nbooks furnished for the purpose. Individuals frequently call upon him to\r\nsettle disputes about boundary lines between their estates.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Schools.--Not every one is competent to teach, and to\r\nprotect the children as far as possible from having their time worse than\r\nwasted by incompetent would-be teachers, is the very responsible duty of\r\nthe county superintendent of schools. From among those who present\r\nthemselves as candidates he selects by a careful examination those whom he\r\ndeems most competent, and gives to each a certificate of qualification. He\r\nvisits the schools and counsels with the teachers regarding methods of\r\ninstruction and management. It is his duty also to hold teacher's\r\nmeetings. He reports annually to the state superintendent of public\r\ninstruction such facts as the superintendent calls for.\r\n\r\nCounty Attorney.--Like railroads and other corporations, the county keeps\r\na regularly employed attorney to act for it in all suits at law. This\r\nofficer is called the county attorney. He represents the state in all\r\ncriminal prosecutions and is for this reason sometimes called the state's\r\nattorney.\r\n\r\nSheriff.--An ancient officer of the county is the sheriff. He has three\r\nprincipal lines of duty: 1. To preserve the peace within the county. 2. To\r\nattend court. 3. To serve processes. He pursues criminals and commits them\r\nto jail. He has charge of the county jail and is responsible for the\r\ncustody of the prisoners confined in it. He opens and closes each session\r\nof the district court, and during the term has charge of the witnesses,\r\nthe juries, and the prisoners. It is his duty to carry into execution the\r\nsentence of the court. He serves writs and processes not only for the\r\ndistrict court, but also for justices of the peace and court\r\ncommissioners.\r\n\r\nCoroner.--Another officer of the county, ancient almost as the sheriff, is\r\nthe coroner. If the dead body of a human being is found under\r\ncircumstances which warrant the suspicion that the deceased came to his\r\ndeath by violence, it is the coroner's duty to investigate the matter and\r\nascertain if possible the cause of the death. He is aided by a jury\r\nsummoned by him for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAt a time in early English history when the only county officers were the\r\nsheriff and the coroner, the coroner acted as sheriff when the latter was\r\nfor any reason incapacitated. And the practice still continues. Thus, if\r\nthere is a vacancy in the office of sheriff, the coroner acts till a new\r\nsheriff is chosen. And in most states the coroner is the only officer who\r\ncan serve process upon the sheriff or who can arrest him.\r\n\r\nClerk of the Court.--The district court [Footnote: See next chapter.] is a\r\n\"court of record.\" That is, it has a seal and a special officer to record\r\nits proceedings. He is called the clerk of the court. He of course also\r\nfiles and preserves the papers in each case. He has also certain\r\nincidental duties.\r\n\r\nCourt Commissioner.--Court is not always in session, and there are certain\r\npowers possessed by a judge \"in chambers,\" that is, which the judge may\r\nexercise out of court. For instance, he may grant a writ of attachment or\r\nof _habeas corpus_. Where a judicial district comprises several counties,\r\nas is usually the case, a provision is made in some states for an officer\r\nin each county authorized to perform such duties in the absence of the\r\njudge. In Minnesota and most other states he is called the court\r\ncommissioner.\r\n\r\nElection and Term.--The county officers are in most sections of the\r\ncountry elected by the people of the county. The term is usually two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nRemovals and Vacancies.--Provision is made for the removal of any county\r\nofficer for non-feasance or malfeasance in office. The power to remove is\r\ngenerally vested in the governor. The accused must be given an opportunity\r\nto be \"heard in his own defense.\" Vacancies are generally filled by the\r\ncounty commissioners. They appoint some one, not one of themselves, to\r\nserve until the next election.\r\n\r\nQualifying.--Each officer before assuming the duties of his office takes\r\nthe official oath. All of the officers except the commissioners and the\r\nsuperintendent of schools are required to give bonds. Copies of these\r\nbonds are preserved by the register of deeds, and the originals are\r\nforwarded to the secretary of state.\r\n\r\nCompensation.--Compensation is usually by salary or by fees. The matter is\r\nusually in the hands of the county commissioners, except so far as\r\nconcerns their own compensation, which is fixed by law. This is usually a\r\n_per diem_.\r\n\r\nEligibility.--Any voter who has resided in the county a certain time\r\n(usually about thirty days) is eligible to any county office, except that\r\nof attorney or court commissioner. The former must be a person admitted to\r\npractice in all the courts of the state. The latter must be a man \"learned\r\nin the law.\"\r\n\r\nIn some cases a person may hold two offices at the same time; thus, a\r\nperson may be court commissioner and judge of probate. But no person can\r\nhold two offices one of which is meant to be a check upon the other. For\r\ninstance, no one could be auditor and treasurer at the same time. In some\r\nstates there is a bar against holding certain offices for two terms in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between a town road and a county road? Point out\r\none of each kind. If you wanted a change in a county road, to whom would\r\nyou apply?\r\n\r\nGet a warranty deed and fill it out for a supposed sale. Compare with it a\r\nmortgage deed. A quitclaim deed. Compare a mortgage deed with a chattel\r\nmortgage. Account for the differences. If A buys a farm from B and does\r\nnot file his deed, who owns the farm?\r\n\r\nIf a man possessing some property should get into habits of gambling and\r\ndebauchery, squandering his money and not providing for his family, what\r\ncould be done? On what grounds could this interference by a public officer\r\nbe justified?\r\n\r\nWho would be keeper of the jail if the sheriff should be a prisoner? Why\r\nnot one of the deputy sheriffs?\r\n\r\nStudy out carefully the derivation of the words auditor, sheriff, coroner,\r\nprobate, commissioner, supervisor, superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe county attorney is usually paid a salary while the register of deeds\r\nusually gets the fees of his office.

Jurisdiction\r\nextends in most states over both personal property and real estate.\r\nIncidentally probate courts appoint guardians for minors and others\r\nsubject to guardianship, and control the conduct and settle the accounts\r\nof such appointees.\r\n\r\nIn many states jurisdiction wholly extraneous to the characteristic work\r\nof these courts is imposed upon them, or the probate business is\r\nassociated with other jurisdiction in the same court. Thus, in Minnesota\r\nthe judge of probate is petitioned in the organization of cities, as we\r\nhave seen. In Wisconsin, the county court, which has charge of the probate\r\nbusiness, has civil jurisdiction also. In Illinois, the county court in\r\naddition to the probate business has jurisdiction \"in proceedings for the\r\ncollection of taxes and assessments.\" And in Kansas, the probate court has\r\njurisdiction in cases of _habeas corpus_.\r\n\r\nProcedure in case a Will has been made.--The proceedings of a probate\r\ncourt have in view two chief objects, namely, to pay the debts of the\r\ndeceased and to distribute the remainder of his property among those\r\nentitled to it. In case the deceased has left a will, the proceedings are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Petition for probate._ Within a short time, usually thirty days, after\r\nthe death of the testator, the executor or other custodian of the will\r\npresents it to the probate court with a petition that it be admitted to\r\nprobate. (For form of petition, see p. 286.)\r\n\r\n2. _Citation to persons interested._ Acting on the petition, the probate\r\njudge publishes in a newspaper a notice to all persons interested in the\r\nestate that at a specified time, action will be taken on the petition. To\r\nafford all who are interested an opportunity to be present at the\r\n\"hearing,\" the notice must be published for a prescribed time, and in some\r\nstates each of the heirs must, if possible, be personally notified.\r\n\r\n3. _Hearing the proofs._ At the time specified in the notice, unless\r\npostponement be granted for cause, the proofs of the validity of the will\r\nare presented. It must be shown that the testator is dead, that the\r\ninstrument was executed by him voluntarily, in the manner prescribed by\r\nstatute, and while he was of \"sound mind and disposing memory.\" Usually it\r\nwill be sufficient for the two witnesses to the instrument to appear and\r\ntestify to the material facts. If any one interested in the distribution\r\nof the property thinks that this will should not be accepted as the \"last\r\nwill and testament\" of the deceased, he should now enter objections. In\r\ncase of a contest, the proceedings are about the same as those in a\r\njustice or circuit court; but there is no jury in the probate court, nor\r\nis there any plea except the petition.\r\n\r\n4. _Admission to probate._ If the proofs are satisfactory to the court,\r\nthe will is \"admitted to probate,\" that is, it is accepted as true and\r\nvalid. Its validity is established by a decree of the court, and a\r\ncertificate of the fact is attached to the will. A copy of the will is\r\nmade in a book kept for the purpose. The original and all the papers in\r\nthe case are filed and preserved by the judge of probate. (See pp. 287 and\r\n288.)\r\n\r\n5. _Issuance of letters testamentary_. The genuineness of the will being\r\nestablished, it is now in order to carry out its provisions. Usually the\r\ntestator designates in his will the person or persons whom he wishes to\r\nact as his representative in the settlement of the estate. Such a person\r\nis called an \"executor.\" If no person is so named, the court appoints an\r\n\"administrator with the will annexed.\" In either case the person derives\r\nhis authority from the court. Unless excused in the will, the executor or\r\nadministrator is required to give bonds proportioned to the amount of the\r\npersonal property in the estate, the amount of bond being specified by the\r\ncourt. The executor is then furnished with a copy of the will and with\r\n\"letters testamentary.\" (The authority granted by the letters may be seen\r\nby reference to the form in the appendix, p. 288.)\r\n\r\n6. _Notice to creditors_. It is a principle of law that all just debts\r\nshall be paid out of one's property before any further disposition thereof\r\ncan take effect. In order that all persons having claims against the\r\nestate of the deceased may have an opportunity to present their accounts,\r\na time for such presentation is designated by the court, and due notice\r\nthereof is given, usually by publication in a newspaper.\r\n\r\n7. _Inventory of the estate_. In the meantime, the executor makes an\r\ninventory of the property, and appraisers appointed for the purpose \"put a\r\nvalue\" thereon, the several items of the inventory being valued\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n8. _Auditing claims._ At the time appointed in the notice, the court\r\npasses upon the claims of creditors. Since unscrupulous persons are at\r\nsuch times tempted to present fraudulent claims, the judge exercises great\r\ncare in examining the accounts. To facilitate matters it is required that\r\naccounts be itemized, and that they be verified by oath.\r\n\r\nDebts are paid out of the personal property, if there be enough. If not,\r\nthe court authorizes the executor to sell real estate to pay the balance.\r\n\r\n9. _Settlement of estate and division of property._ The executor having\r\ncollected debts due the estate and settled all claims against it, makes\r\nhis final statement to the court, and the remaining property is\r\ndistributed among the heirs and legatees. To continue and perfect the\r\nchain of title, the division of the real estate is recorded in the office\r\nof the register of deeds.\r\n\r\nIf there are minor heirs, the court appoints guardians for them.\r\n\r\nProcedure in case no Will is made.--If there is no will, the four steps\r\nwhich have in view the establishment of the validity of the will, are\r\nunnecessary. The initial step in this case is the appointment of an\r\nadministrator to do the work which under a will is done by the executor.\r\nIn order that an administrator acceptable to the heirs may be appointed,\r\nthe following steps are taken:\r\n\r\n1. Someone interested in the estate petitions for the appointment of a\r\ncertain person as administrator.\r\n\r\n2. Notice of hearing is given by publication, citing those interested in\r\nthe estate to appear at a certain day if they desire to enter any\r\nobjection to the appointment.\r\n\r\n3. If at the time specified for the hearing no objection is made, the\r\nperson petitioned for is appointed administrator, and \"letters of\r\nadministration\" are issued to him.\r\n\r\nThen beginning with the sixth step the proceedings are substantially the\r\nsame as in case of a will, except that the basis of distribution in the\r\nninth is the _law_ instead of the _will_.\r\n\r\n\"As befits an authority which thus pervades the sanctity of a household,\r\ncrosses the threshold and exposes to public view the chamber of mourning,\r\nprobate jurisdiction in the United States is exercised with great\r\nsimplicity of form as well as decorum.\" [Footnote: Schouler's Executors\r\nand Administrators.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWhat is a will? [Footnote: See Dole's Talks about Law.] Why must it be in\r\nwriting? Must it be in the handwriting of the testator? Why are the\r\nwitnesses essential? Is the form of a will essential? Is it necessary that\r\nthe witnesses know the contents of the will?\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between an heir and a legatee? May either be\r\nwitness to the will? Why? If the witnesses die before the testator, how\r\ncan the will be proved?\r\n\r\nWhat is a codicil? If there be two wills of different dates, which will\r\nstand? What difference does it make whether a person having property makes\r\na will or not?\r\n\r\nGroup the proceedings in case of a will into three groups.\r\n\r\nA minor may have two guardians, one of its person and the other of its\r\nproperty? Why? What is to hinder a guardian from abusing his trust?\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRICT, CIRCUIT OR SUPERIOR COURTS.\r\n\r\nJurisdiction.--This court has original jurisdiction in all civil and\r\ncriminal cases within the district which do not come within the\r\njurisdiction of the justice courts. It has appellate jurisdiction from\r\nprobate and justice courts as provided by law.\r\n\r\nProcedure.--The proceedings are substantially the same as in a justice\r\ncourt except that in criminal cases they are based upon an indictment by\r\nthe grand jury, and after the arguments the judge \"charges\" the jury, that\r\nis, instructs it regarding its duty.\r\n\r\nPleadings.--The pleadings in the district court are somewhat more\r\nelaborate than in a justice court, and a few words in regard to them\r\nfurther than what has already been given may not be out of place here.\r\n\r\nThe defendant in making his plea may raise a question as to the\r\njurisdiction of the court, or he may ask that the case be thrown out of\r\ncourt on account of some irregularity of the writ upon which it is based.\r\nSince these pleas, if successful, simply delay the trial, because a new\r\nsuit may afterwards be brought, they are called _dilatory pleas_.\r\n\r\nBut he may deny the plaintiff's ground of action by denying the\r\nallegations of the plaintiff and challenging him to trial. This plea is\r\ncalled the general issue. He may admit the plaintiff's allegations but\r\nplead other facts \"to avoid their effect.\" This is called the plea of\r\nconfession and avoidance. These pleas are on the merits of the case, and\r\nare called _pleas in bar_. There are other pleas of this kind.\r\n\r\n\"Pleas in bar, except the general issue, may give rise to counter pleas\"\r\nintroduced by the parties alternately.\r\n\r\nBut the issue may be one of law instead of fact, and the defendant may\r\nenter a _demurrer_, claiming that the matters alleged are not sufficient\r\nin law to sustain the action.\r\n\r\nEvidence.--Some of the fundamental principles or rules which govern the\r\ntaking of evidence and the weighing of testimony may properly appear here.\r\nThese rules are designed to exclude all irrelevant matter and to secure\r\nthe best proof that can be had.\r\n\r\n1. _Witnesses must be competent_. That is, in general, they must be able\r\nto understand the nature and solemnity of an oath. This will usually\r\nexclude children below a certain age, insane persons and persons drunk at\r\nthe time of offering testimony.\r\n\r\n2. _Witnesses must testify of their own knowledge_. Usually they are\r\nbarred from telling what they simply believe to be the fact or what they\r\nhave learned from hearsay.\r\n\r\n3. _Evidence must go to prove the material allegations of the pleadings_.\r\nIt must be confined to the question at issue. It is to be observed that\r\nthe evidence must not only go to prove the matter alleged, but it must be\r\nthe _material_ not the superfluous matter. What is material and what\r\nsuperfluous will depend upon the case. Thus if it is alleged that a suit\r\nof clothes was obtained by the defendant at a certain time, his obtaining\r\nthe clothes is the material fact and the time may be superfluous or\r\nimmaterial. But if a note is in controversy its date is material as\r\nestablishing its identity.\r\n\r\n4. _\"The evidence must be the best of which the case is susceptible.\"_\r\nThus, in case of a written instrument the best evidence is the instrument\r\nitself; the next best, a copy of it; the next, oral statement of its\r\ncontents. And a copy will not be accepted if the original can be produced.\r\n\r\n5. _The burden of proof lies on the affirmative_. In civil cases the party\r\naffirming is usually the plaintiff. In criminal cases it is the state.\r\nHarmonizing with this principle is the constitutional provision that in\r\ncriminal cases the accused shall not be required to give evidence against\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThese are the principal rules of evidence, but they have many\r\napplications. Learned volumes have been written elaborating them.\r\n\r\nGrand Jury.--A grand jury may be defined as a body of men returned at\r\nstated periods from the citizens of the county, before a court of\r\ncompetent jurisdiction, chosen by lot, and sworn to inquire of public\r\noffenses committed or triable in the county.\r\n\r\nThe number of grand jurors was formerly twenty-three. By statute many of\r\nthe states have fixed upon a smaller number, Oregon having only seven. A\r\ncommon number is fifteen. Some states have no grand jury. In some others\r\nthe grand jury is summoned only when requested by the court.\r\n\r\nThe United States constitution and most of the State constitutions declare\r\nthat no person shall be held to answer for a criminal offense, except a\r\nminor one, \"unless on the presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\" This\r\nis to save people from the vexation and expense of arrest and trial unless\r\nthere is reasonable presumption of their guilt. On the other hand, a grand\r\njury should aid in bringing to justice persons who indulge in practices\r\nsubversive of public peace, but which individuals are disinclined to\r\nprosecute, such as gambling. Incidentally the grand jury examines into the\r\ncondition of the county jail and poor-house.\r\n\r\nThe mode of selecting grand jurors is in general the same in all the\r\nstates. The steps are three: first, the careful preparation of a list of\r\npersons in the county qualified to serve; second, the selection, by lot,\r\nfrom this list of the number of persons needed; third, the summoning of\r\nthe persons so chosen. The number of persons in the first list is from two\r\nto three times the number of jurors. The preparation of the list is in\r\nsome states entrusted to the county board; in others, to jury\r\ncommissioners; in others, to the local boards. The names are reported to\r\nthe clerk of the court, who in the presence of witnesses, makes the\r\nselection by lot. The summoning is done by the sheriff.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of the term, the court appoints one of the jurors\r\nforeman. The jury is then sworn, and, after being charged by the court,\r\nretires to a private room and proceeds to the performance of its duty.\r\n\r\nThe deliberations of the grand jury are conducted in secret. It may,\r\nhowever, summon and examine witnesses, [Footnote: Witnesses for the\r\naccused are not usually examined by the grand jury.] and may have the\r\nadvice of the court or of the county attorney.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a crime has been committed within the county may be brought\r\nto the notice of the grand jury by any member thereof or by any other\r\nperson. If upon examination there seems to be reason for believing that it\r\nwas committed by the person accused, the county attorney is called upon to\r\nframe a formal accusation against him, called an _indictment_, which is\r\nendorsed with the words \"a true bill,\" and sent to the court. Upon the\r\nindictment the person accused is arrested and tried.\r\n\r\nIf the evidence against the accused is insufficient to warrant indictment,\r\nbut yet his innocence is questionable, the grand jury may bring a\r\n_presentment_ against him. This is an informal statement in writing\r\naddressed to the court setting forth the offense and stating that there is\r\na reasonable probability that a certain person, named, has committed it. A\r\nperson arrested on a presentment is examined before a justice of the peace\r\nor other magistrate, as if arrested on a complaint. Neither an indictment\r\nnor a presentment can issue except upon concurrence of the number of grand\r\njurors specified by statute. Under former practice the jury numbered\r\ntwenty-three and the concurrence of twelve was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe grand jury is bound to investigate the charge against any one held by\r\na justice \"to await the action of the grand jury;\" also any charge brought\r\nby a member of the grand jury. And conversely it is the sworn duty of each\r\nmember to report any crime known by him to have been committed within the\r\ncounty. Any outsider may file information or bring charges, but the grand\r\njury may use its own judgment as to the necessity of investigating them.\r\n\r\nPetit Jury.--A petit jury is a body of twelve men impaneled and sworn in a\r\ndistrict court to try and determine by a true and unanimous verdict, any\r\nquestion or issue of fact, in any civil or criminal action or proceeding,\r\naccording to law and the evidence as given them in court.\r\n\r\nThe mode of selecting petit jurors is in general the same as that pursued\r\nin selecting grand jurors. The \"list of persons qualified to serve\" is,\r\nhowever, usually larger. The \"selection by lot\" is made thus: slips of\r\npaper, each containing one of the names, are folded and deposited in a\r\nbox. The box is shaken, and the prescribed number of slips is drawn. The\r\npersons whose names thus appear are summoned as jurors.\r\n\r\nWhen an action is called for trial by jury, the clerk draws from the jury\r\nbox the ballots containing the names of the jurors, \"until the jury is\r\ncompleted or the ballots exhausted.\" If necessary, the sheriff under\r\ndirection of the court summons bystanders or others in the county to\r\ncomplete the jury. Such persons are called _talesmen_.\r\n\r\nTo secure an impartial jury, each party may object to or \"challenge,\" a\r\nnumber of the jurors. The challenge may be \"peremptory\" or \"for cause.\"\r\nThe peremptory challenge, as its name implies, is one in which no reason\r\nneed be assigned. The number of such challenges must, of course, be\r\nlimited. In civil suits it is usually limited to three by each party. In\r\ncriminal cases, the state has usually two peremptory challenges and the\r\ndefendant five. If the offense is punishable with death or state prison\r\nfor life, the state has in Minnesota seven peremptory challenges and the\r\ndefendant twenty.\r\n\r\nChallenges for cause may be either general or particular. A general\r\nchallenge of a proposed juror may be made on the basis of his incompetency\r\nor unworthiness to act in such capacity in _any_ action. A particular\r\nchallenge may be based on some bias in this particular case which would\r\nunfit the proposed juror for rendering an impartial verdict.\r\n\r\nHabeas Corpus.--Not connected directly with trials but related to the\r\ndistrict court is the writ of _habeas corpus_. This is the most famous\r\nwrit in law, and has been styled \"the chief bulwark of liberty.\" It was\r\ndesigned originally to secure a person from being detained in prison\r\nwithout due process of law, and it served as a mighty check upon arbitrary\r\npower. Its operation has been extended so as to include any detention\r\nagainst the will of the person detained. The writ, as will be seen by\r\nreference to the appendix (p. 290), commands the person holding another in\r\ncustody to bring him before the judge and show cause for the detention. If\r\nthe judge finds that the prisoner is detained for cause he remands him to\r\ncustody; if not he orders his discharge.\r\n\r\nConcluding Remarks.--This discussion might easily be continued. Volumes\r\nhave been written on the administration of justice. But perhaps enough has\r\nbeen given to show that great care is taken to protect the interests of\r\nthe innocent and to do equal and exact justice to all. In view of flippant\r\nremarks sometimes made regarding courts of justice, it is pertinent and\r\nproper to go at least so far into detail. The study of Civil Government\r\nwill have been pursued to little purpose if respect for law be not one of\r\nits fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Pertinent Questions_\r\n\r\nHow many judicial districts in this state? [Footnote: Consult Legislative\r\nManual.] How many counties in the largest? In the smallest? How many have\r\nmore than one judge? Why not let each county constitute a judicial\r\ndistrict?\r\n\r\nIf some one owed you $40 and refused to pay, in what court could you sue?\r\nIf he owed you $250? If the suit involved $1,000,000?\r\n\r\nWhat is the relation of the plea to the action? Can anything be proved\r\nwhich is not alleged in the plea? Show the purpose of each rule of\r\npleading. Of each rule of evidence.\r\n\r\nWhat are the differences between a grand jury and a petit jury? Why is\r\neach so named?\r\n\r\nIf a person accused of crime is examined and held by a justice of the\r\npeace, as stated in a previous chapter, must he be indicted by a grand\r\njury before he can be tried? Why? May a person's acts be inquired into by\r\nthe grand jury without his knowing anything about it? May grand jurors\r\nreveal the proceedings of the jury? Why?\r\n\r\nWhy is there such a thing as a peremptory challenge of a juror? Why so\r\nmany given to a person accused of crime?\r\n\r\nAre lawyers officers of the court? What oath does each take on admission\r\nto the bar?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Questions for Debate_\r\n\r\nResolved, That trial by jury has outlived its usefulness.\r\n\r\nResolved, That capital punishment is not justifiable.\r\n\r\n_References_.--Dole's Talks about Law; Lieber's Civil Liberty and Self\r\nGovernment, 234-6; The Century, November 1882; Atlantic Monthly, July 1881;\r\nNorth American Review, March 1882 and July 1884.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Papers--Prepare with care the \"tabular views\" of the town,\r\nvillage, city and county, as follows]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOld England.--Not only our language but also very many of our political\r\ninstitutions we have inherited from England. But the country now called by\r\nthat name is not the real _old_ England. The fatherland of the English\r\nrace is the isthmus in the northern part of Germany which we now call\r\nSchleswig. Here dwelt the old Angles or English. To the north of them in\r\nJutland was the tribe called the Jutes, and to the south of them, in what\r\nwe now call Holstein and Friesland, dwelt the Saxons. \"How close was the\r\nunion of these tribes was shown by their use of a common name, while the\r\nchoice of this name points out the tribe which at the moment when we first\r\nmeet them, in the fifth century, must have been the most powerful in the\r\nconfederacy.\" [Footnote: Green's History of the English People.] Among\r\nthemselves they bore in common the name of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nAmong the characteristics of those German ancestors of ours are the\r\nfollowing: They were very independent; the free landholder was \"the\r\nfree-necked man.\" The ties of kinship were very strong. \"Each kinsman was\r\nhis kinsman's keeper, bound to protect him from wrong, to hinder him from\r\nwrong-doing, and to suffer with and pay for him if wrong were done.\"\r\n[Footnote: Green's History of the English People.] They were very much\r\nattached to home. \"Land with the German race seems everywhere to have been\r\nthe accompaniment of full freedom.... The landless man ceased for all\r\npractical purposes to be free, though he was no man's slave.\" [Footnote:\r\nGreen's History of the English People.] Among themselves they were quite\r\nsocial. Though tillers of the soil they lived, not isolated, but grouped\r\ntogether in small villages. This may have been partly for mutual\r\nprotection. They were lovers of law and order.\r\n\r\nThe Township.[Footnote: See American Political Ideas, pp. 31-63.]--The\r\nderivation of the word \"township\" shows us to whom we are indebted for the\r\ninstitution itself. The word is derived from the Anglo-Saxon _tun-scipe_.\r\n_Tun_ meant hedge, ditch or defense; and _scipe_, which we have also in\r\nlandscape, meant _what may be seen_. Around the village before mentioned\r\nwas the _tun_, and beyond were the fields and meadows and woodlands, the\r\nwhole forming the tun scipe or township.\r\n\r\nTo administer justice and to take any other action for the common good,\r\nthe freemen gathered in _folk-moot_ around the moot hill or the sacred\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThough the proceedings of these assemblies differed in detail from those\r\nof our town meetings, both contain the great principle of local self\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe County.[Footnote: See American Political Ideas, pp. 31-63.]--Although\r\nwith us the state is divided into counties and the counties into towns,\r\nthe order of formation was originally the other way. The towns are the\r\noldest institutions in our system. Later, from uniting forces in war came\r\na union of action among adjoining towns during peace. Thus grew up what\r\nwas called the Hundred.\r\n\r\nWhen in the fifth century the English invaded Britain, many of the\r\nchieftains or military leaders rose to kingship over small areas. On the\r\ncompletion of the conquest these kings struggled among themselves for\r\nleadership, until finally England became united into one kingdom, and the\r\nlittle kingdoms were reduced to shires ruled by earls. With the growth of\r\nthe king's power, that of the underkings or earls grew less. Then other\r\nshires were formed, and this institution became simply an administrative\r\ndivision. After the Norman conquest the French terms count and county came\r\ninto use.\r\n\r\nThe earnest student will find both pleasure and profit in looking up the\r\norigin and history of the trial by jury, the criminal warrant, the writ of\r\nhabeas corpus, bail, common law, the general rules of parliamentary\r\npractice, etc.\r\n\r\nTown and County in America.--In New England the most important division of\r\nthe state is the town; in the South it is the county.[Footnote: An\r\nexcellent discussion of this may be found in \"Samuel Adams, the Man of the\r\nTown Meeting,\" John's Hopkins University Studies in History, Volume II,\r\nNumber 4.] In other states the relative importance of the two\r\norganizations depends upon the influence to which the state was most\r\nstrongly subjected.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the difference is found in the character and circumstances\r\nof the early colonists.\r\n\r\nIn New England, the church was the center of the community. The severity\r\nof the climate and the character of the soil made it impracticable to\r\ncultivate large farms. The colonists had come mainly from the towns of\r\nEngland. These considerations and the presence of fierce and unfriendly\r\nIndians caused the settlers to group themselves into compact settlements.\r\nTheir self assertion prompted them, and their intelligence enabled them,\r\nto take active part in public affairs. Hence the importance of the town in\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\nIn the South, the colonies were planted largely in the interests of the\r\nproprietaries. The leading spirits had been county gentlemen in England\r\nand they naturally favored the county system. The mass of the people were\r\nunaccustomed and indifferent to direct participation in the government.\r\nAgain, the warm climate and fertile lands were favorable to large\r\nplantations and a dispersed population; so that the character of the\r\npeople and the circumstances under which they lived were alike favorable\r\nto the establishment of the county system pure and simple. To quote the\r\npithy statement of Professor Macy, \"The southern county was a modified\r\nEnglish shire, with the towns left out. Local government in New England\r\nwas made up of English towns with the shire left out.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently counties were formed in New England for judicial purposes,\r\nbut the towns retained the greater number of their functions; and in the\r\nsouth, the counties were afterwards subdivided into election and police\r\ndistricts, but the administrative power remained with the county.\r\n\r\nThe Middle States divided the local power between the town and the county.\r\n\r\nMigration is chiefly along the parallels of latitude. And people from\r\nhabit and instinct organize new governments largely on the plans to which\r\nthey are accustomed. Hence we are not surprised to find that in the states\r\nformed south of the line of the Ohio, the county is the principal division;\r\nwhile in the northwestern states the town is the important factor. Though\r\nin the Northwest the county is more important than in New England, the\r\ninfluence of the towns in county affairs is generally maintained by the\r\nselection of members of the county board from the several towns.\r\n\r\nIllinois is a good example of the truth of the generalizations at the\r\nbeginning of the preceding paragraph. The state is very long and reaches\r\nfar to the south. The southern part of the state was settled first, and\r\nalmost pure county government prevailed. By and by the northern part began\r\nto settle, and it grew in population faster than the southern part. The\r\ntown was introduced, and now prevails in all but a few counties.\r\n\r\nCan you see the relation of these facts to the generalization? Can you\r\ntell where the people of the two sections of the state came from?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nWHY WE HAVE STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Historical reason_. We have states now because we had such\r\norganizations at the time this government was established. The colonies,\r\nfounded at different times, under different auspices, by people differing\r\nin religion, politics, and material interests, remained largely\r\nindependent of each other during colonial times, and on separating from\r\nEngland became independent _states_.\r\n\r\n2. _Geographical reason_. Different climatic and topographic conditions\r\ngive rise to different industries, and therefore necessitate different\r\nregulations or laws.\r\n\r\n3. _Theoretical reason_. The theory of our government is that of\r\n_decentralization of power_.[Footnote: There being a constant tendency to\r\ncentralization, this thought should be emphasized. See Nordhoff's Politics\r\nfor Young Americans. (71)] That is, we think it best to keep power as near\r\nas possible to the people. If a certain work can be accomplished fairly by\r\nindividual enterprise, we prefer that it be done so rather than through\r\nany governmental agency. If work can be done by the town just as well as\r\nby the county, we assign it to the town. And as between the state and the\r\ngeneral government, we assign no duty to the latter which can be performed\r\nas well by the former.\r\n\r\n4. _Practical reasons_. There are many practical reasons. Among them may\r\nbe mentioned the following:\r\n\r\nWe need the state as a basis for the apportionment of members of congress.\r\nThis is a federal republic, and representation in the national councils\r\ncan be had only through statehood.\r\n\r\nWe need the state to establish a system of education, to control\r\ncorporations, to put down riots when the local authorities cannot do so,\r\nto establish the smaller organizations, etc. These are some of the things\r\nreferred to in paragraph three, which the state can do better than the\r\ngeneral government.\r\n\r\nThere is in the state also a high court of justice to which cases may be\r\nappealed from the courts below.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW STATES ARE CREATED.\r\n\r\nThe \"old thirteen\" originated in revolution. They _declared_ themselves\r\n\"free and independent states,\" and maintained the declaration by force of\r\narms. Each became a state \"in the Union\" by ratifying the constitution.\r\nUnder the constitution states have been admitted into the Union on terms\r\nprescribed by congress. The plan in general is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. When the number of people in a territory equals or nearly equals the\r\nnumber required to secure a representative in congress, the inhabitants\r\nthereof may petition congress, through their delegate, for an act\r\nauthorizing the formation of a state government.\r\n\r\n2. If the petition is granted, an \"enabling act\" is passed. This usually\r\ndefines the territory to be comprised in the new state, provides for the\r\ncalling of a constitutional convention, requires that the state government\r\nto be framed shall be republican in form, states the number of\r\nrepresentatives in congress which the state shall have until the next\r\ncensus, and offers a number of propositions for acceptance or rejection by\r\nthe convention. Among these are proposals giving land for the support of\r\ncommon schools and of a university, and for the erection of public\r\nbuildings; and offering a portion of the net proceeds of the sale of\r\npublic lands within the state for internal improvements. These offers are\r\nconditioned upon non-interference on the part of the state with the\r\nholding and selling by the United States of the lands within the state\r\nowned by the general government, and their exemption from taxation. The\r\nenabling act for Minnesota is given in the appendix, pp. 355-8. It is in a\r\nlarge measure typical. Students in most of the states can find the\r\nenabling act for their state in the legislative manual thereof.\r\n\r\nMichigan, Kansas and Oregon formed their constitutions without an enabling\r\nact.\r\n\r\n3. The constitutional convention provided for in the enabling act, having\r\nascertained that it is the wish of the people to form a state, frames a\r\nconstitution and submits it to the people of the proposed state for\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\n4. If it is adopted, [Footnote: Wisconsin rejected the constitution of\r\n1846, and New York that of 1867.] copies of the constitution are sent to\r\nthe president and to each house of congress.\r\n\r\n5. If the constitution framed is in accordance with our institutions, it\r\nis accepted and the state is admitted. [Footnote: The acts of congress of\r\n1866 and 1867, admitting Colorado, were both vetoed by president Andrew\r\nJohnson.]\r\n\r\nKentucky, West Virginia, Maine, California and Texas became states in the\r\nUnion without having been territories. The first two were detached from\r\nVirginia, and the third from Massachusetts, and admitted at once as\r\nstates. California and Texas had been independent states before admission.\r\n\r\nAs typical of the mode of restoring the southern states to their old place\r\nin the Union, the act restoring Tennessee is given on page 358.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSTATE CONSTITUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir purpose.--A constitution in the American sense of the term is a\r\nwritten instrument defining the powers of government and distributing\r\nthose powers among the branches or departments thereof. It is the\r\nfundamental law, the voice of the people granting or withholding power. A\r\nprimary purpose of the instrument is to give form and authority to the\r\ngovernment; another is to protect individuals and minorities from the\r\ntyranny of the majority. Each of the states has a constitution.\r\n\r\nTheir origin.--In most of the countries of Europe, including England, what\r\nis called the constitution is not written. It consists largely of the\r\nmaxims of experience, the principles sanctioned by custom. When a new\r\npolitical custom becomes prevalent it gradually becomes recognized as part\r\nof the constitution.\r\n\r\nWritten constitutions in this country probably arose from the fact that\r\nthe charters granted to the colonies and securing to them privileges, were\r\nin writing. And these written charters themselves grew out of a practice\r\nprevalent in England of securing the rights of towns and cities by written\r\ncharters wrung from the king. Some general charters of liberties, too, had\r\nbeen secured. Among these may be mentioned the charter granted by Henry I.\r\nin 1100; the Magna Charta, or great charter, wrung from King John in 1215;\r\nand the Petition of Right, the Habeas Corpus Act, and the Bill of Rights,\r\nsecured in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nSome of the charters granted to colonies were so liberal in their terms\r\nthat they were adopted as constitutions when the colonies became states.\r\nThe charter of Connecticut remained its constitution till 1818. And even\r\nin 1842 it was with difficulty that the people of Rhode Island could be\r\nprevailed upon to give up the old charter for a new constitution.\r\n\r\nTheir Contents.--The state constitutions are very much alike in their\r\ngeneral characteristics. After a preamble, setting forth the purpose of\r\nthe instrument, they usually contain a bill of rights, intended to secure\r\npersonal liberty and other personal rights. They then distribute the\r\npowers of government among three branches or departments, and provide for\r\nthe organization and general procedure of each. Then follow miscellaneous\r\nprovisions, relating to franchise, education, amendments, etc.\r\n\r\nTheir usual defects.--We have flourished so wonderfully under our system\r\nof government that we naturally have a great reverence for our national\r\nand state constitutions. So far has this feeling gone that a large number\r\nof people seem to fancy that there is some magic in the very word\r\nconstitution. As a consequence state constitutions are usually too long;\r\nthey contain too many miscellaneous provisions. Most of these relate to\r\ntransient or petty matters which, if made affairs for public action at\r\nall, should be left to legislation. Changes in the constitution weaken our\r\nrespect for it. Rarely should anything go into that great charter which\r\nhas not stood the test of time, unless it has the promise of endurance as\r\na necessary safeguard of the rights and liberties of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILLS OF RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nThese usually assert or guarantee the following:\r\n\r\nRepublican Principles.--That governments are instituted by the people and\r\nfor their benefit; that all persons are equal before the law; that no\r\ntitle of nobility shall be granted.\r\n\r\nFreedom of Conscience.--That there shall be perfect religious freedom,\r\nnot, however, covering immoral practices; that there shall be no\r\nestablished or state church; that no religious test shall be required for\r\nthe performance of any public function.\r\n\r\nFreedom of Speech.--That any one may freely think, and publish his\r\nopinions, on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of this right.\r\n\r\nFreedom of Assembly.--That the people may peaceably assemble to discuss\r\nmatters of public interest and to petition the government for redress of\r\ngrievances. This, of course, does not permit meetings designed to arrange\r\nfor the commission of crime.\r\n\r\nFreedom of Person.--That there shall be no slavery; nor imprisonment for\r\ndebt, except in cases of fraud; nor unwarranted searches or seizures of\r\npersons or property; that no general warrants shall be issued; that the\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_ shall not be suspended, except in certain\r\nemergencies; that persons may freely move from place to place.\r\n\r\nSecurity of Property.--That private property shall not be taken for public\r\nuse without just compensation therefor, previously paid or secured; that\r\nto prevent feudal tenure of land, long leases of agricultural land shall\r\nnot be made, in most states the longest permitted term being twenty-one\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nRight to bear Arms.--That the right of the people to keep and bear arms\r\nshall not be infringed.\r\n\r\nFreedom from Military Tyranny.--That the military shall be in strict\r\nsubordination to the civil power; that there shall be no standing army in\r\ntime of peace; nor shall any soldier in time of peace be quartered in\r\nprivate houses without the consent of the owner.\r\n\r\nForbidden Laws.--That no _ex post facto_ law, no law impairing the\r\nobligation of contracts, nor any bill of attainder shall be passed; that\r\nthere shall be no special laws in certain specified cases.\r\n\r\nRights of Accused Persons.--(a) _Before trial_. That no unwarranted\r\nsearches or seizures shall be made; that, except in capital offenses, the\r\naccused shall, while awaiting trial, be bailable; that, except in minor\r\ncases, a person shall not be held to answer for a criminal offense unless\r\non the presentment or indictment of a grand jury. (b) _On trial_. That the\r\naccused person shall have a speedy and public trial in the district where\r\nthe crime was committed; that trial by jury shall remain inviolable; that\r\nthe accused shall be informed of the nature of the charge against him;\r\nthat he shall be confronted with the witnesses against him; that he may be\r\nheard in his own defense and shall have the benefit of counsel in his\r\nbehalf; that he shall not be required to witness against himself; that he\r\nshall have compulsory process to compel the attendance of witnesses in his\r\nbehalf; that he shall not be deprived of life, liberty or property without\r\ndue process of law. (c) _After trial_. That no cruel or unusual punishment\r\nshall be inflicted; that no one shall twice be placed in jeopardy for the\r\nsame offense.\r\n\r\nRights not enumerated.--There is usually a final statement that the\r\nenumeration of the above rights shall not be construed to deny or impair\r\nothers inherent in the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS ON THE ABOVE.\r\n\r\nThe rights above enumerated are among those which to us in America to-day\r\nseem almost matters of course. It seems strange that any one ever\r\nseriously questioned the fairness or the justice of the claims there set\r\nforth. But in enumerating them we are treading on sacred ground. Their\r\nestablishment cost our ancestors hundreds of years of struggle against\r\narbitrary power, in which they gave freely of their blood and treasure.\r\n\r\nMany of these rights are guaranteed in the constitution of the United\r\nStates, but only as against the general government. That they may not be\r\ninvaded by the state government, the people have reserved them in the\r\nstate constitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions_.\r\n\r\nIn what sense are all men created equal? Is there anything in good blood?\r\nWhat was meant by the \"divine right\" of kings to rule?\r\n\r\nCould a Mormon practice polygamy in this state, it being part of his\r\nreligious creed? Why? Can an atheist give evidence in court?\r\n\r\nWhat constitutes libel? Slander?\r\n\r\nOn what basis may a mob be dispersed? What cases of petition have you\r\nknown?\r\n\r\nWhat is a general warrant? A passport? Why may _habeas corpus_ be\r\nsuspended in time of war.\r\n\r\nGive instances of private property taken for public use. What is meant by\r\nfeudal tenure? How long a lease of agricultural lands may be given in this\r\nstate? How about business property in a city?\r\n\r\nMay a person lawfully carry a revolver in his pocket? Why?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by the military being subordinate to the civil power? Which\r\noutranks, the secretary of war or the general of the army? Why should the\r\nstatement be made about quartering soldiers, in view of the preceding\r\nstatement?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by an _ex post facto_ law? Why forbidden? May a law be\r\npassed legalizing an act which was performed as a matter of necessity but\r\nwithout authority?\r\n\r\nWhat is to hinder an enemy of yours from having you arrested and cast into\r\nprison and kept there a long time? What is the purpose of bail? Why\r\nregarded as an important element of liberty? Why should a grand jury have\r\nto indict a person who has been examined and held for trial by a justice\r\nof the peace? Does a prisoner charged with murder or other high crime\r\nremain in handcuffs during his trial? Name the three or four most\r\nimportant guarantees to an accused person. Why are so many provisions made\r\nin his behalf?\r\n\r\nIf a ruler should wish to subvert the liberties of a people used to these\r\nguarantees, where would he begin?\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the advantages possessed by a written constitution over\r\nan unwritten one? Of an unwritten over a written one? Is any part of our\r\nconstitution unwritten?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nBRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulations and Laws.--When the school officers, acting for the people of\r\nthe district, state formally what may and what may not be done by teachers\r\nand pupils, the formal expressions of governing will are called rules and\r\nregulations. Similar expressions by the town, village, city, or county\r\nauthorities are called ordinances or by-laws. But when the state expresses\r\nits will through the regular channels, the formal expression is called a\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nThe Three Branches of Government.--After a law is made it needs to be\r\ncarried into effect. Incidentally questions will come up as to its meaning\r\nand application. Government, then, has three great functions or powers\r\nwith regard to law.\r\n\r\nIn our government, and to a greater or less extent in all free countries,\r\nthese powers are vested in three _distinct_ sets of persons. If one person\r\nor group of persons could make the laws, interpret them, and enforce\r\nobedience to them as interpreted, the power of such person or persons\r\nwould be unlimited, and unlimited power begets tyranny. One of the\r\npurposes of a constitution is to limit the power of the government within\r\nits proper sphere, and to prevent misuse of authority; and this\r\norganization of the government in three departments, each acting\r\nindependently so far as may be, and acting as a check upon the others, is\r\none of the modes of limitation.\r\n\r\nThe law-making, the law-interpreting, and the law-enforcing branches are\r\ncalled respectively the legislative, the judicial, and the executive\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBicameral.--The legislature of every state consists of two chambers or\r\nhouses. The _reason_ for this is that during colonial times most of the\r\nlegislatures consisted of two houses, the governor's council and the\r\nrepresentative assembly. Then on becoming states, each of the \"old\r\nthirteen,\" except Pennsylvania, organized bicameral legislatures. And the\r\nnew states, being largely settled by people from the older states,\r\nnaturally followed their example. The structure of congress has also had\r\nmuch influence.\r\n\r\nThe _advantages_ to be derived from having two houses are numerous.\r\nPerhaps the only one which it is necessary to mention here is that it\r\ntends to prevent hasty legislation, because under this arrangement a bill\r\nmust be considered at least twice before passage.\r\n\r\nApportionment.--As the population of a state is changeful, the\r\nconstitution does not usually specify the number of members to compose\r\neach house. This is determined, within certain limitations imposed in the\r\nconstitution, by the legislature itself. A re-apportionment is usually\r\nmade every five years, after a census by the state or general government.\r\nThe number of senators usually ranges between thirty and fifty; that of\r\nrepresentatives from seventy-five to one hundred and fifty.\r\n\r\nMeeting.--The legislature meets biennially in most of the states. People\r\nare beginning to understand that they may suffer from an excess of\r\nlegislation. Some of the English kings used to try to run the government\r\nwithout parliament, and frequent sessions of parliament were then demanded\r\nas a protection to popular rights. Hence our forefathers instinctively\r\nfavored frequent sessions of the legislature. But such necessity no longer\r\nexists, and for many reasons the states have with a few exceptions changed\r\nfrom annual to biennial sessions. [Footnote: Extra sessions may be called\r\nby the governor. Mississippi has its regular sessions for general\r\nlegislation once in four years, and special sessions midway between.]\r\n\r\nElection.--Senators and representatives are both elected by the people. In\r\nsome cases the states are divided into senatorial and representative\r\ndistricts in such a way that each elects one senator and one\r\nrepresentative, the senate districts being of course the larger. In other\r\ncases, the state is divided into senate districts only, and each senate\r\ndistrict chooses one senator and an assigned number of representatives.\r\nThe former plan prevails in Wisconsin, for instance, and the latter in\r\nMinnesota. The number of representatives chosen in a senatorial district\r\nvaries from one to half a dozen, dependent upon population. Illinois has a\r\npeculiar, and it would seem an excellent, plan. The state is divided on\r\nthe basis of population into fifty-one parts as nearly equal as possible.\r\nEach of these districts elects one senator and three representatives. In\r\nvoting for representatives, a person may mass his three votes on one\r\ncandidate, or give them to two or three. The purpose is to enable a party\r\nin the minority to secure some representation.\r\n\r\nTerm.--The length of term of legislators usually depends upon the\r\nfrequency of sessions. The general principle seems to be that\r\nrepresentatives shall serve through one session and senators through two.\r\nHow long, then, would you expect the respective terms to be in states\r\nhaving annual sessions? In states having biennial sessions? By reference\r\nto the comparative legislative table on page 293 confirm or reverse your\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nVacancy.--In case of a vacancy in either house the governor orders a new\r\nelection in the district affected by the vacancy.\r\n\r\nIndividual House Powers.--Each house has certain powers conferred by the\r\nconstitution having for their object the preservation of the purity and\r\nindependence of the legislature. Among these are the following:\r\n\r\n1. _Each house is the judge of the election, returns, and qualification of\r\nits own members._ Each person elected to either house receives from the\r\ncanvassing board of the district through its clerk a certificate of\r\nelection, which he presents when he goes to take his seat. Should two\r\npersons claim the same seat, the house to which admission is claimed\r\ndetermines between the contestants. The contest may be based, among other\r\nthings, upon fraud in the election, a mistake in the returns, or alleged\r\nlack of legal qualification on the part of the person holding the\r\ncertificate. Into any or all of these matters the house interested, _and\r\nit only_, may probe, and upon the question of admission it may pass final\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n2. _Each house makes its own rules of procedure._ These, usually called\r\nrules of parliamentary practice, you can find in the legislative manual.\r\nUpon their importance as related to civil liberty, consult Lieber's Civil\r\nLiberty and Self-Government.\r\n\r\nThe power to preserve order applies not only to members but to spectators\r\nalso. Disorderly spectators may be removed by the sergeant-at-arms. On the\r\norder of the presiding officer such persons may be placed in confinement\r\nduring the remainder of the daily session.\r\n\r\nUnruly members are as a general thing simply called to order. For\r\npersistent disorder they may be reprimanded or fined. [Footnote: See Among\r\nthe Lawmakers, pp. 230-3.] But in extreme cases they may be expelled. To\r\nprevent a partizan majority from trumping up charges and expelling members\r\nof the opposite party, it is a common constitutional provision that the\r\nconcurrence of two-thirds of all the members elected shall be necessary\r\nfor expulsion.\r\n\r\n3. _Each house chooses its own officers_. Each house has a presiding\r\nofficer, several secretaries or clerks, a sergeant-at-arms, a postmaster,\r\nand a chaplain. The sergeant-at-arms usually has a number of assistants\r\nappointed by himself, and there are a number of pages appointed by the\r\npresiding officer. These, however, hardly count as officers. The only\r\nexception to the rule enunciated is in those states having a lieutenant\r\ngovernor, who is _ex officio_ president of the senate. Even in that case,\r\nthe senate elects in case of a vacancy, the person so elected being chosen\r\nfrom among their own number and receiving usually the title of president\r\n_pro tempore_.\r\n\r\nQuorum.--It would hardly be possible for all members to be present every\r\nday, therefore a number less than the whole should have authority to act.\r\nBut this number should not be very small. The several constitutions fix\r\nthe quorum for each house, usually at a majority of the members elected to\r\nit. But a smaller number has power of adjournment from day to day, so that\r\nthe organization may not be lost; and it may compel the attendance of\r\nabsent members, by sending the sergeant-at-arms after them.\r\n\r\nPublicity.--On the theory that legislators are servants of the people, we\r\nwould naturally expect the proceedings to be made public. And so they are.\r\nPublicity is secured in the following ways:\r\n\r\n1. In accordance with the constitutional provision, each house keeps a\r\njournal of its proceedings which it publishes from time to time, usually\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n2. Spectators are admitted to witness the daily sessions.\r\n\r\n3. Newspaper reporters are admitted, and are furnished facilities for\r\nmaking full and accurate reports.\r\n\r\nPrivileges of Members.--In order that their constituents may not, for\r\nfrivolous or sinister reasons, be deprived of their services in the\r\nlegislature, the members of each house are _privileged from arrest_\r\n\"during the session of their respective houses, and in going to and\r\nreturning from the same.\" Nor can civil suit be brought against them\r\nduring that time. But they may be arrested for treason, (defined in the\r\nconstitution), felony, or breach of the peace, because if guilty they are\r\nunworthy of a seat in the legislature.\r\n\r\nAnd in order that there may be the utmost _freedom of speech_ in the\r\nlegislature, that any member who knows of wrong being done may feel\r\nperfectly free to say so, the constitution of each state provides that\r\n\"for any speech or debate in either house, they shall not be questioned in\r\nany other place.\"\r\n\r\nCompensation.--Members of the legislature receive for their services a\r\nsalary, which is sometimes specified in the constitution, but which is\r\nusually fixed by law. In the latter case no increase voted can be in\r\neffect until a new legislative term begins. This proviso is, of course,\r\ndesigned to remove the temptation to increase the salary for selfish ends.\r\n\r\nIn some countries no salary is paid to legislators, the theory being that\r\nwith the temptation of salary removed only persons of public spirit will\r\naccept election. Our argument is that unless some remuneration be given,\r\nmany persons of public spirit and possessed of capacity for public service\r\nwould be barred from accepting seats in the legislature. In other words,\r\nthe state wants the services of her best citizens, and does not wish lack\r\nof wealth on the part of any competent person to stand in the way. On the\r\nother hand, that there may be no temptation to continue the sessions for\r\nthe purpose of drawing the pay, the constitution provides, where a _per\r\ndiem_ salary is paid, that members shall not receive more than a certain\r\nsum for any regular session, or a certain other sum for any extra session.\r\n\r\nProhibitions on Members.--To secure for his legislative duties the\r\nundivided attention of each member, the constitution provides that \"no\r\nsenator or representative shall, during the time for which he is elected,\r\nhold any office under the United States or the State.\" In some states, as\r\nin Minnesota, the office of postmaster is excepted. And in order that\r\nlegislators may be freed from the temptation to create offices for\r\nthemselves or to increase the emoluments of any office for their own\r\nbenefit, it provides that \"no senator or representative shall hold any\r\noffice under the state which has been created or the emoluments of which\r\nhave been increased during the session of the legislature of which he was\r\na member, until one year after the expiration of his term of office in the\r\nlegislature.\"\r\n\r\nEligibility.--To be eligible to the legislature a person must be a\r\nqualified voter of the state, and a resident thereof for, usually, one or\r\ntwo years; and shall have resided for some time, usually six months or a\r\nyear, immediately preceding election, in the district from which he is\r\nchosen. This last provision is made to preclude people who have not been\r\nliving in the district, and who therefore cannot know it or be interested\r\nparticularly in its welfare, from representing it in the legislature.\r\n\r\nSole Powers.--The mode of making laws is discussed in another place.\r\n[Footnote: See \"How Laws Are Made,\" page 344.] In making laws the houses\r\nhave concurrent jurisdiction--they both take part. But there are some\r\nparts which belong to each house separately, besides the election of\r\nofficers before mentioned. The house of representatives has in all states\r\nthe sole power of impeachment, [Footnote: For mode of proceeding see page\r\n331.] and in some states of originating bills for raising revenue. This\r\nlatter power is given to it because being elected for a short term it is\r\nmore directly under the control of the people than is the senate.\r\n\r\nThe power to impeach is vested in the representatives because for the\r\nreason stated, they seem more immediately in fact as well as in name to\r\nrepresent the people, who it will be remembered are always the complainant\r\nin criminal cases. And the senate has the sole power of trying\r\nimpeachments. [Footnote: When the governor is being tried, the lieutenant\r\ngovernor cannot act as a member of the court.] The length of term frees\r\nthe members from the fear of immediate punishment in case of an unpopular\r\nverdict. And if they are right time will show it. Historically, this\r\ndivision of power in cases of impeachment is derived from colonial\r\npractice and from the constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe senate has also the sole power of confirming or rejecting the\r\nappointments of the governor.\r\n\r\nForbidden Laws.--In addition to the laws forbidden in that part of the\r\nconstitution called the bill of rights, the legislature is usually\r\nforbidden to pass laws authorizing any lottery; or granting divorces; or\r\ngiving state aid to private corporations; or involving the state in debt,\r\nexcept in case of war or other emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nDefine constitution. What is a law? What is meant by common law? Statute\r\nlaw? Equity?\r\n\r\nBy reference to the comparative legislative table in the appendix, tell\r\nthe most common name applied to the legislative body; any peculiar names;\r\nthe names most commonly applied to the respective houses; the usual\r\nqualifications of members; the frequency of regular sessions, and the\r\nmonth of meeting most usual. Why is this time of year so uniformly chosen?\r\nWhat relation do you see between the frequency of sessions and the term of\r\nmembers? What is the relation between the terms of the respective houses?\r\nHow does the number of senators compare with the number in the lower\r\nhouse? What state has the largest house? The smallest? Why is the term\r\n_senate_ so common? Look up the derivation of the word. In what section of\r\nthe country are the terms the shortest? Can you account for this? Which\r\nstates require the highest qualifications in members?\r\n\r\nFind out whether in your state there are any requirements not given in the\r\ntabulation. By reference to the legislative manual or other source of\r\ninformation find out any other facts of interest, such as the names of the\r\nspeaker and other legislative officers; the number of your senatorial\r\ndistrict, and the name of your senator; of your representative district,\r\nand the name of your representative; what committees are appointed in each\r\nhouse, and on which your local representatives are, and how they came to\r\nbe selected for these particular committees; how vacancies are filled in\r\nthe legislature; any contested elections that have occurred in your state\r\nand the basis of the contest; some of the important rules of parliamentary\r\npractice; the salary paid members in your state; any cases of impeachment,\r\nthe charge, and the outcome; other forbidden laws.\r\n\r\nIf two persons claim the same seat in the senate, who will decide between\r\nthem? In the lower house? What are the returns, and where are they kept?\r\nWhat appeal from decision is there? If your legislature is now in session,\r\nwrite to your representatives asking them to send you regular reports of\r\nthe proceedings. Don't expect to get such reports for the whole session,\r\nhowever; that would be asking too much. From the newspapers, report on\r\nMonday the principal proceedings of the previous week. Have you ever seen\r\na legislature in session? What is to keep a member of the legislature from\r\nslandering people?\r\n\r\nState five powers which can be exercised only by the senate. Five, in some\r\nstates four, which can be exercised only by the lower house.\r\n\r\nAre you eligible to the legislature? If not, what legal qualifications do\r\nyou lack? Could a member of the legislature be elected governor or United\r\nStates senator?\r\n\r\nAt the last election did you preserve any of the tickets? Could you secure\r\nany of the ballots that were actually used in voting? Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTIVE BRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficers.--The chief executive office in every state is that of governor.\r\nThere is in each a secretary of state and a state treasurer. Most states\r\nhave also a lieutenant governor, a state auditor or comptroller, an\r\nattorney general, and a state superintendent of public instruction. In\r\nnearly every case these offices are created by the state constitution.\r\n\r\nEligibility.--The qualifications required in the governor and lieutenant\r\ngovernor are age, citizenship of the United States, and residence within\r\nthe State. The age qualification is required because the responsibilities\r\nare so great as to demand the maturity of judgment that comes only with\r\nyears. The requirement of citizenship and that of residence are so\r\nobviously proper as to need no comment.\r\n\r\nFor the other offices the qualifications required in most states are\r\nsimply those required in a voter. [Footnote: For which see page 298.]\r\n\r\nElection.--In every state the governor is elected by the people, and in\r\nmost states the other officers are also. In a few states, some of the\r\nofficers are chosen by the legislature on joint ballot, or are appointed\r\nby the governor and confirmed by the senate.\r\n\r\nTerm.--The terms of office of the governors are given in the table. Unless\r\notherwise stated, the term of the other officers in each state is the same\r\nas that of the governor thereof. For the highest efficiency the term of a\r\nstate officer should not be very short, two years being better than one,\r\nand four years better than two. When the term is four years, it may be\r\nwell to limit the number of terms for which an officer may be elected. In\r\nsome cases this is done.\r\n\r\nRemoval.--These officers and the others provided by statute may be removed\r\non impeachment by the house of representatives, and conviction by the\r\nsenate.\r\n\r\nVacancy.--For the office of governor there is in every state a line of\r\nsuccession appointed in its constitution. By reference to the comparative\r\ntable, it will be seen that there is considerable uniformity in the order\r\nof succession. In case of a vacancy in any of the other elective offices,\r\nthe most usual plan is for the governor to make a temporary appointment\r\nuntil a new election can be held. For an appointive office, the\r\nappointment is usually good until the end of the next legislature or for\r\nthe remainder of the term.\r\n\r\nSalary.-The salary attached to each office is usually fixed by law,\r\nsubject to the constitutional limitation that it shall not be increased\r\nnor diminished during the term of the incumbent. See page 294.\r\n\r\nThe Duties of the Officers.\r\n\r\nGovernor.--The great, the characteristic duty of the governor is to see\r\nthat the laws are faithfully executed. Since this may sometimes require\r\nforce, he is made by the constitution commander-in-chief of the military\r\nforces of the state, and may call out these forces to execute the laws,\r\nsuppress insurrection, or repel invasion.\r\n\r\nHe appoints, \"by and with the advice and consent of the senate,\" most of\r\nthe important state officers and boards, as provided by law. The advice of\r\nthe senate is rarely if ever asked. But its consent must be obtained to\r\nmake any such appointment valid.\r\n\r\nAs his duties continue through the year and have to do with the whole\r\nstate, and as he may require the opinion, in writing, of the principal\r\nofficer in each of the executive departments upon any subject pertaining\r\nto the duties of their respective offices, he is supposed to know more\r\nthan any other person about the situation and needs of the state as a\r\nwhole; and it is, therefore, made his duty to communicate by message to\r\neach session of the legislature such information touching the affairs of\r\nthe state as he deems expedient. The regular message is sent at the\r\nopening of the legislative session, and special messages at any time\r\nduring the session as they seem to be needed. On extraordinary occasions\r\nhe may convene the legislature in extra session.\r\n\r\nTo place another obstruction in the way of hasty legislation, the governor\r\n(except in Delaware, North Carolina, Ohio, and Rhode Island) has a limited\r\nveto. [Footnote: See comments on the president's veto, page 150.]\r\n\r\nIn the administration of justice mistakes are some times made. An innocent\r\nperson may be found guilty, or a guilty person may be sentenced too\r\nseverely, mitigating circumstances appearing after sentence is passed. For\r\nthese and other reasons, there should be power somewhere to grant\r\nreprieves, commutations, and pardons. In most of the states this power is\r\nvested in the governor. It does not, for obvious reasons, extend to cases\r\nof impeachment. Many thoughtful people, including some governors and\r\nex-governors, question very seriously the wisdom of this absolute\r\nassignment of the pardoning power. One suggestion by way of limitation is\r\nthat no pardon issue except upon recommendation of the judge of the court\r\nin which conviction was wrought.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Governor.--As may be seen by reference to the comparative\r\ntable, several of the states have no such officer. The office is designed\r\nsimply to save confusion in case of a vacancy in the office of governor,\r\nin which case the lieutenant governor acts as governor during the vacancy.\r\nTo give him something to do the lieutenant governor is _ex officio_\r\npresident of the senate. [Footnote: In case of a vacancy in this office,\r\nthe senate, in most states, chooses one of its own number to act as\r\npresident _pro tempore_.] In most of the states, he has no voice in\r\nlegislation, except a casting vote in case of a tie. But in some states,\r\nas indicated in the comparative table on page 294, he can debate in\r\ncommittee of the whole.\r\n\r\nState Treasurer.--This officer has duties and responsibilities similar to\r\nthose of a county treasurer.\r\n\r\nAttorney General.--This officer has two chief duties. He represents the\r\nstate in suits at law, and may be called upon to aid county attorneys in\r\ncriminal prosecutions. When invited to do so he gives legal advice to the\r\nlegislature and to the executive officers, on matters pertaining to their\r\nofficial duties.\r\n\r\nSecretary of State and Auditor.--The county auditor, you remember, has\r\nthree general lines of duty: 1. To act as official recorder and custodian\r\nof papers for the county board. 2. To be bookkeeper for the county, and in\r\nconnection therewith to audit all claims against the county, and issue\r\nwarrants on the county treasurer for their payment. 3. To apportion the\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding duties in the state, except recording the acts of the\r\nlegislature, which is done by legislative clerks, are in most states\r\ndivided between two officers, the secretary of state and the state auditor\r\nor comptroller.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of state has, as his characteristic duty, the preservation\r\nor custody of state papers, acts of the legislature, etc. He is also\r\nkeeper of the great seal of the state, and authenticates state documents,\r\ncommissions, etc. Incidentally he has other duties. In some states he\r\nprepares the legislative manual; he sees that the halls are ready for the\r\nsessions of the legislature, calls the house to order at its first\r\nmeeting, and presides until a speaker is chosen. He also indexes the laws\r\nand other state documents, and superintends their printing and\r\ndistribution. [Footnote: In some states there is a superintendent of\r\nprinting.]\r\n\r\nThe auditor or comptroller is bookkeeper for the state, audits accounts\r\nagainst it, and draws warrants upon the state treasurer for their payment.\r\n[Footnote: No money can be paid out except on appropriation by the\r\nlegislature.] The state auditor, also, comparing the legislative\r\nappropriations with the assessed value of the property of the state,\r\ncomputes the rate of the state tax and reports it to county auditors.\r\n\r\nIn some states, Wisconsin, for instance, the duties of both offices are\r\nperformed by the secretary of state.\r\n\r\nIn some states the auditor is _ex officio_ land commissioner. In other\r\nstates there is a separate officer to take charge of state lands.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction.--This officer has general\r\nsupervision and control of the educational interests of the state. He is\r\noften _ex officio_ a member of the board of regents of the state\r\nuniversity, of the board of directors of the state normal schools, and of\r\nthe state high school board. He has the appointment and general management\r\nof state teachers' institutes. He meets and counsels with county and city\r\nsuperintendents. Thus an active, earnest, competent man may influence for\r\ngood the schools of all grades throughout the state. He reports to the\r\nlegislature at each session, through the governor, the condition and needs\r\nof the schools of the state. In this report he recommends such measures\r\nfor the improvement of the educational system of the state as he deems\r\nadvisable. In many states he apportions the state school money.\r\n\r\nAssistants.--Usually the above officers have assistants appointed by\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER STATE OFFICERS.\r\n\r\nThe officers given above are the typical state officers, but every state\r\nhas others. Of these the most important are shown in the comparative\r\ntabulation.\r\n\r\nSome states provide the governor with a council. This is in most cases\r\nsimply an advisory, not an administrative or executive body.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualifications required in the governor of this state? The\r\nlieutenant governor? The other officers? The names of the state officers?\r\nThe length of their terms? The officers not mentioned in the text, and\r\ntheir duties? Name the state officers whom you have seen.\r\n\r\nWhich states require the highest qualifications in the governor? The\r\nlowest? Which give the longest term? The shortest? The highest salary? The\r\nlowest? Which states limit the number of terms? Which have no lieutenant\r\ngovernor? In which states is a majority vote required? Does there seem to\r\nbe any sectional law as to these things; that is, is there anything\r\npeculiar to New England, or to the south, or to the northwest? What seems\r\nto be the general law of succession to the governorship? What exceptions?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by saying that the governor executes the law? Is this saying\r\nstrictly true? Is a sheriff an executive or a judicial officer? The\r\nconstable? The mayor of a city? Can an executive officer be sued? A\r\njudicial officer?\r\n\r\nHow many senators and representatives would it take to pass a bill over\r\nthe governor's veto? Have you ever known of its being done? If the\r\ngovernor should go to Washington on business of the state or on private\r\nbusiness, who would act as governor? How long would he so act? Could he\r\npardon convicts at that time? Have you ever read a message of the\r\ngovernor?\r\n\r\nIf the state superintendent of public instruction wants information on\r\nsome point of school law, to whom should he appeal? How much would he have\r\nto pay for the advice? What force would the opinion have? Could he obtain\r\na legal opinion as to a private matter on the same terms?\r\n\r\nIf you had a bill against the state, how would you get your pay? If\r\npayment were refused what could you do? (Do not try to answer off-hand.\r\nAsk a lawyer.)\r\n\r\nHow are the expenses of the state government met? The amount of state\r\nexpenses last year? (See report of treasurer.)\r\n\r\nWhat are the sources of the school fund, of this state? Did you ever know\r\nof school lands being sold in your county? By whom, how, and on what\r\nterms?\r\n\r\nName your county superintendent of schools. The state superintendent. Is\r\nthere a United States superintendent? Get the report of the state\r\nsuperintendent and find out what it contains. Ask your teacher to let you\r\nsee the teachers' report to the county superintendent. How much state\r\nmoney did your district receive last year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nOTHER STATE OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdjutant-General.--To aid the governor in the discharge of his duties as\r\ncommander-in-chief, there is an officer called the adjutant-general.\r\nThrough him all general orders to the state militia are issued. He also\r\nkeeps the rolls and records of the militia. In some states he is required\r\nby law to act as attorney for those seeking pensions from the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nRailroad Commissioners.--To prevent railroads from charging extortionate\r\nrates for passengers or freight; to see that reasonable facilities are\r\nprovided, such as depots, side tracks to warehouses, cars for transporting\r\ngrain, etc.; to prevent discrimination for or against any person or\r\ncorporation needing these cars; in other words, to secure fair play\r\nbetween the railroads and the people, a railroad commission consisting of\r\nfrom one to three members has been established in many states by the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nInsurance Commissioner.--To protect the people from unreliable insurance\r\ncompanies, there is an officer called the insurance commissioner. No\r\ninsurance company can legally transact business in the state until it has\r\nsatisfied the commissioner that its methods of insurance and its financial\r\ncondition are such as to give the security promised to those insured by\r\nit. The certificate of authority granted to any company may be revoked by\r\nthe commissioner at any time if the company refuses or neglects to comply\r\nwith the conditions established by law.\r\n\r\nState Librarian.--Each state has a valuable library, composed chiefly of\r\nlaw books, but containing also many other valuable books and pamphlets.\r\nThis library is open to the public. It is in charge of the state\r\nlibrarian, who acts under prescribed rules.\r\n\r\nPublic Examiner.--To render assurance doubly sure that public money shall\r\nbe used only for the purposes for which it is designed, provision is made\r\nfor the appointment of \"a skillful accountant, well versed in the theory\r\nand practice of bookkeeping,\" to exercise constant supervision over the\r\nfinancial accounts of state and county officers and of banking\r\ninstitutions incorporated under state laws. This officer is called the\r\npublic examiner.\r\n\r\nThe officers visited are required by law to furnish the public examiner\r\nfacilities for his work, and to make returns to him under oath. The\r\nexaminer reports to the governor, who is empowered to take action to\r\nprotect the interests of the people.\r\n\r\nOil Inspector.--To protect the people from the danger of burning oil unfit\r\nfor illuminating purposes, there is an officer called the inspector of\r\nilluminating oils. The inspector appoints a deputy for each county. It is\r\nthe duty of these officers to test the illuminating oils offered for sale,\r\nand to mark the barrel or package containing it \"approved\" or \"unsafe for\r\nilluminating purposes,\" as the case may be. Penalties are attached to the\r\nselling of oils not approved.\r\n\r\nBoiler Inspector.--Steam is now used as power in threshing grain and in\r\ngrinding it, in sawing lumber, in propelling boats and cars, etc. To\r\nprevent loss of life, engineers must pass an examination and secure a\r\ncertificate of qualification. And boilers must be inspected at least once\r\na year to prevent explosions. The latter duty devolves upon the state\r\nboiler inspector and his assistants. Locomotive engines on railroads are\r\nsometimes exempt from government inspection, because of the invariably\r\nhigh skill of the engineers and the great care of the companies.\r\n\r\nLabor Commissioner.--Among the questions now receiving consideration from\r\nstates and nations are many referring to labor--the healthfulness of\r\nfactories, hours of labor, employment of children, protection against\r\naccidents, etc. In many of the states there is a commissioner of labor to\r\nmake inspections and formulate statistics pertaining to labor.\r\n\r\nOfficers Peculiar to Certain States.--There are in some states other\r\nofficers, necessitated by special industries. Thus, in Minnesota, where\r\nthe grain, dairy and lumber interests are very important, there are\r\ninspectors of grain, a dairy commissioner, and surveyors-general of logs.\r\n\r\nAppointment and Term.--The officers named in this chapter are elected in\r\nsome states; in others they are appointed by the governor and confirmed by\r\nthe senate. The term is usually two years.\r\n\r\nAll are required to give bonds for the faithful discharge of their duties.\r\nAll have clerks, deputies, or assistants, appointed by themselves, for\r\nwhose official acts they are responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATIVE BOARDS.\r\n\r\nBesides the boards in charge of the several state institutions there are\r\nusually a number of administrative boards. Of these the most important are:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _The state hoard of health_, whose duty it is \"to make inquiries\r\nconcerning the causes of disease, especially of epidemics; the effect of\r\nemployments, conditions, and circumstances upon the public health,\" etc.\r\n\r\n2. _The state board of charities and corrections_, whose duty it is \"to\r\ninvestigate the whole system of public charities and correctional\r\ninstitutions of the state, and examine into the condition and management\r\nthereof, especially of prisons, jails, infirmaries, public hospitals, and\r\nasylums.\"\r\n\r\n3. _State board of equalization_, which equalizes assessments throughout\r\nthe state so as to render taxation as nearly just as possible. This board\r\ntakes cognizance only of _classes_ of property; it does not attempt to\r\ncorrect individual grievances.\r\n\r\n4. _The state board of immigration_, appointed \"to encourage immigration,\r\nby disseminating information regarding the advantages offered by this\r\nstate to immigrants.\"\r\n\r\n5. _The commissioners of fisheries_, whose duty is to take means to\r\nincrease the number of food fish in lakes and rivers. To this end the\r\nboard secures from the United States commissioner of fisheries the quota\r\nof spawn allotted from time to time to the state, and from other sources\r\nspawn of such fish as seem desirable, and has them placed in such lakes\r\nand rivers as they will be most likely to thrive in.\r\n\r\nThe members of these boards are appointed by the governor. They serve\r\nwithout pay, except the board of equalization. The state pays the expenses\r\nincident to the discharge of their duty. The secretary of each board\r\nreceives a salary, specified by law.\r\n\r\nThere are also boards to examine candidates for admission to practice\r\nmedicine, pharmacy, dentistry, and law.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nLocate the state university, the state normal schools, all of the schools\r\nfor the unfortunate, the lunatic asylums, the state prisons.\r\n\r\nWhat is the maximum rate per mile that can be charged by railroads for the\r\ntransportation of passengers in this state? How came this to be? If a\r\nfarmer wished to ship a carload of wheat without putting it into a\r\nwarehouse, how could he get a car? If a car were refused what could he do?\r\n\r\nExamine the end of a kerosene cask, and find out what the marks on it\r\nmean. By reference to the latest report of the secretary of the state\r\nboard of immigration, find out what inducements to immigrants this state\r\noffers. Is there probably such a board as this in the eastern states? Why?\r\nIn European countries? Why?\r\n\r\nDoes your school receive copies of the pamphlets issued by the state board\r\nof health?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE JUDICIAL BRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that minor differences may be adjudicated in each town,\r\nvillage and city, by justices of the peace and municipal courts; and that\r\ncourts having jurisdiction unlimited as to the amount at controversy are\r\nheld in every county. And these may all be properly called state courts,\r\nthe state being subdivided into judicial districts, each comprising one or\r\nmore counties, for the purpose of bringing justice within the reach of\r\nevery person. But there is also in every state a\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE SUPREME COURT.\r\n\r\nNeed of.--The supreme court is needed for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. _To review cases on appeal._ Notwithstanding the great care exercised\r\nin the lower courts, errors are liable to occur, and the person aggrieved\r\nmay ask for a new trial. If this be denied, he may appeal to the supreme\r\ncourt. Appeals are usually taken on one or more of three grounds--(a) On\r\nexceptions to rulings of the judge as to the admissibility of testimony;\r\n(b) On exceptions to the judge's charge to the jury; (c) On the ground\r\nthat the verdict of the jury is not warranted by the evidence.\r\n\r\n2. _To interpret the law._ The exceptions referred to in the preceding\r\nparagraph may involve the meaning of a law. In that case the decision of\r\nthe supreme court establishes the meaning of the law in question, and the\r\nlower courts of the state are thereafter bound by the interpretation\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n3. _To pass upon the constitutionality of a law._ The appeal may be made\r\nfor the purpose of testing the constitutionality of a law. If declared\r\nunconstitutional by the supreme court, the law is void.\r\n\r\n4. _To issue certain remedial writs._ Among these may be mentioned the\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_ and the writ of _mandamus_. Thus, if a person has\r\nbeen committed to prison by decree of one of the lower courts, to appeal\r\nthe case and get it reviewed, might take so much time that the term of\r\nimprisonment would expire before relief could be obtained. To bring the\r\nmatter quickly to the test, the writ of _habeas corpus_ may be used.\r\n\r\nHow Constituted.--The supreme court consists of one chief justice and two\r\nor more associate justices. The number in each state may be seen by\r\nreference to the appendix (pp. 296-7), as may also the term of service,\r\nthe number of sessions held during the year, etc.\r\n\r\nReports.--Since the decisions of the supreme court are binding upon all\r\nthe lower courts of the state, they must be published in permanent form.\r\nTo this end, the clerk of the supreme court makes an elaborate record of\r\neach case; the judges render their decisions in writing, giving their\r\nreasons at length; and the reports of the decisions are prepared for\r\npublication with great care by an officer called the reporter. The\r\ndecision is written by one of the judges, who signs it, but it must be\r\nagreed to by a majority of the court. The bound volumes of reports are\r\nfound in every lawyer's library.\r\n\r\nA Court of Final Appeal.--In all cases involving only state laws, and this\r\nincludes a large majority of cases, the decision of the state supreme\r\ncourt is final. Only on the ground that the state law is not in harmony\r\nwith the constitution or laws of the United States can a case involving\r\nsuch a law be appealed from the supreme court of the state. The appeal is\r\nto the supreme court of the United States, which decides merely the\r\nquestion of the validity of the law.\r\n\r\nState Courts and Federal Courts.--The jurisdiction of the United States\r\ncourts is given in the constitution of the United States, Article III,\r\nsection 2. If during the progress of a trial in a state court, rights\r\nclaimed under the United States constitution or laws or under a treaty of\r\nthe United States become involved, the case may be removed to a federal\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nNo Jury in the Supreme Court.--There is no jury in the supreme court.\r\nQuestions of fact are determined in the lower courts. Appeals are on\r\nquestions of law. A transcript of the proceedings in the trial court is\r\nsubmitted to the supreme court. Ask a lawyer to show you a brief and a\r\npaper book.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nGive the jurisdiction of a justice court. Of a probate court. Of a\r\ndistrict or circuit court. Of the supreme court?\r\n\r\nWho is the recording officer of a justice court? Of a probate court? Of a\r\ndistrict court? Of the supreme court?\r\n\r\nWho keeps a record of the testimony in a justice court? In a district\r\ncourt? What is meant by \"noting an exception,\" and why is it done? If a\r\nperson is dissatisfied with the decision of the supreme court, what can he\r\ndo about it?\r\n\r\nWho besides the judges of the supreme court can issue the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus?_\r\n\r\nName the justices of the supreme court of this state. How are they chosen?\r\nHow long do they serve? How many terms does this court hold annually?\r\nWhere are they held? How long do they last? Read some of the syllabi of\r\nthe decisions as they appear in the newspapers. Who prepares these\r\noutlines for the press?\r\n\r\nWhich state in the Union has the largest supreme court? Which has the\r\nsmallest? Which demands the highest qualifications? In which is the term\r\nthe longest? In which the shortest? Does a decision of the supreme court\r\nof New York have any weight in Minnesota? Which states rank highest in the\r\nvalue attached to the decisions of their supreme courts? How do you\r\naccount for this?\r\n\r\nPaper: By means of pages 292-7, &c., prepare a tabular view of your state,\r\ntaking that on pages 314-15 as a model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nRETROSPECT AND PROSPECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach Organization a Miniature Government.--Some things of general interest\r\nare matters for regulation by the state as a whole, through its\r\nlegislature. But many things are properly left to local regulation. For\r\ninstance, in a timbered town, where fences can be cheaply built, it may be\r\ndesirable, especially if there is much wild land, to let cattle run at\r\nlarge, each person _fencing out_ the cattle from his crops. On the other\r\nhand, in a prairie town, where fencing is expensive, or where there is\r\nlittle wild land, it may seem best to arrange that each person shall\r\n_fence in_ his own cattle. No persons can judge which is the better plan\r\nfor a given neighborhood so well as the people who live there. And to them\r\nit is left, to be determined at the annual meeting. In passing upon such\r\nquestions, in appropriating money for local improvements, &c., powers\r\npseudo-_legislative_ are exercised. Matters of detail are determined by\r\nthe supervisors, and they with the clerk, the treasurer, the road\r\noverseers, the constables, and the assessor, constitute what may be called\r\nthe _executive_, or more properly the _administrative_, department. And\r\nthe local _judicial_ functions are performed by the justices of the peace.\r\nSimilarly it may be shown that the village, the city, and the county are\r\ngovernments in miniature.\r\n\r\nLocal Officers as State Officers.--The governor is the _chief_ executive\r\nofficer of the state, but not the _only_ one. There are others enumerated\r\non pages 90-99. But besides these, the state uses local officers in part\r\nto carry into execution the acts of the legislature. For instance, when\r\nthe legislature has appropriated a certain sum for a specific purpose, the\r\nexecutive department raises and applies the money. To this end, the\r\ntaxable property of the state is \"valued\" by the assessors; these\r\nestimates are reviewed by the boards of equalization; the county auditors\r\nmake up the tax lists; the county treasurers collect the money and\r\ntransmit it to the state treasurer, from whom it goes to the institution\r\nfor whose benefit it was appropriated.\r\n\r\nAll writs issued by justices of the peace run in the name of the state,\r\nshowing that these are in a certain sense state judicial officers.\r\n\r\nState Officers as United States Officers.--As a rule the United States\r\nappoints its own officers, and stations them where they are needed. But in\r\na very few cases, state officers are used. For instance, in order that\r\npersons accused of crime against the United States may be promptly\r\napprehended, commissioners of the United States circuit court are\r\nappointed in every state with power to issue warrants of arrest and take\r\ntestimony. But in the absence of a commissioner, the warrant may be issued\r\nand testimony taken by any judicial officer of the state. In such a case,\r\na justice of the peace may act temporarily as a United States officer. The\r\nbest interests of society are served thereby.\r\n\r\nElective and Appointive Officers.--In the school district and the town all\r\nofficers are elected, none being appointed except to fill vacancies. As\r\nthe organizations increase in size, appointive offices increase relatively\r\nin number, until among officers of the United States only two are elected.\r\nMembers of the _legislative_ department in each of the organizations are\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nVacancies.--These occur usually either by death or resignation,\r\noccasionally by removal from office. To save the expense of a special\r\nelection, vacancies in elective offices are filled by temporary\r\nappointment, except in the case of members of the legislature and members\r\nof the United States house of representatives.\r\n\r\nResignations.--These are sent as a rule: (a) by elective officers, to that\r\nofficer who is authorized to make the temporary appointment or to order a\r\nnew election; (b) by appointive officers, to the body, board, or officer\r\nthat appointed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWho constitute the legislative department in a town? In a village? In a\r\ncity? In a county? The executive in each? The judicial? Show that the\r\ncounty superintendent of schools is also one of the executive officers of\r\nthe state. Do any local officers belong to the state legislative\r\ndepartment? Should the judges of the circuit court be elected or\r\nappointed? Should all the county officers be elected at the same time? To\r\nwhom would a member of congress send his resignation if he desired to be\r\nrelieved? A judge of the state supreme court? The county auditor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nTHE NATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the government of the United States, we must\r\nexamine its beginnings and antecedents.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLONIES.\r\n\r\nWhen Columbus returned to Spain with his marvelous stories of the New\r\nWorld, expeditions were fitted out which soon filled the coffers of that\r\ncountry with wealth from Mexico, Central and South America, and the West\r\nIndies. Spain became the wealthiest nation of the world. Other countries\r\nsoon caught the infection, and expeditions were sent from France, Holland\r\nand England, the other great commercial nations of western Europe.\r\n\r\nFor a long time scarcely any effort was made to form permanent\r\nsettlements, and the attempts that were by and by made were unsuccessful.\r\nFor more than a hundred years the territory now included within the United\r\nStates remained unoccupied, except at a few points in the southern part.\r\nExplorations were, however, pushed with vigor, and many conflicting claims\r\nwere based upon them.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of the seventeenth century permanent settlements began\r\nto be made, yet the increase in population was for the succeeding hundred\r\nand fifty years very slow. During this time settlements were made in the\r\ntropical part of America by the Spanish; the French founded settlements in\r\nCanada and established a chain of forts along the Ohio and Mississippi;\r\nand the English, though claiming all the land to the Pacific, made\r\nsettlements only along the Atlantic. The Dutch and the Swedes made\r\nsettlements along the Hudson and about Delaware Bay, respectively.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the eighteenth century, the Swedes had been dispossessed\r\nby the Dutch, who in turn had succumbed to the English. And in 1756 began\r\nthe great struggle between France and England for the possession of the\r\nMississippi Valley. England won, and the existence of the United States as\r\nwe know and love it became a possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF THE REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the Revolutionary War fall naturally into two great classes,\r\nthe remote and the immediate.\r\n\r\nThe Remote Causes.--Among the underlying causes of the war may be\r\nmentioned the following:\r\n\r\n1. _The location of the colonies._ They were separated from the mother\r\ncountry by a great ocean, which then seemed many times as wide as it does\r\nnow. Communication was so infrequent that the authorities in England could\r\nnot keep track of what was going on in America, and misgovernment could\r\nflourish unchecked because unknown. And so far away and so differently\r\ncircumstanced from the people in England were the people of the colonies\r\nthat the former could not appreciate the real needs of the latter.\r\n\r\n2. _The character of the colonists._ Character is the product largely of\r\nancestry and circumstances. The ancestors of these people, after a\r\nstruggle lasting hundreds of years, had established liberty in England and\r\nintrenched it in guarantees the wisest ever devised by man. From them the\r\ncolonists inherited the right of freedom from arbitrary arrest; of giving\r\nbail in ordinary offenses; of a speedy, public trial by jury, near the\r\nplace where the crime was alleged to have been committed; of the writ of\r\nhabeas corpus; of established rules of evidence; and, indeed, of nearly\r\nall the rights mentioned in the first ten amendments to the constitution\r\nof the United States. Their ancestors had, in the war between Cromwell and\r\nCharles I., laid down their lives to establish the principle that taxes\r\ncan be laid only by the people or by their representatives. The colonists\r\nthemselves had been compelled to face difficulties incident to life in a\r\nnew country, and had developed the power to act independently in matters\r\npertaining to their individual good. And in the management of their\r\nseveral commonwealths they had gained considerable experience in\r\ngovernmental affairs. With such ancestry and such experience they would\r\nnot tamely endure being imposed upon.\r\n\r\n3. _The character of the king._ On the death of Queen Anne without an\r\nheir, George I., elector of Hanover, had become king of England, and he\r\nhad been succeeded by his son, George II. To both of these kings England\r\nwas really a foreign country, of whose institutions, and of whose language\r\neven, they were profoundly ignorant. As a consequence, their personal\r\ninfluence in England was small. When, in 1760, young George III. ascended\r\nthe throne, he resolved to be king in fact as well as in name. This\r\ndetermination, which he adhered to, coupled with his unfamiliarity with\r\nEnglish institutions, explains many things otherwise difficult to\r\nunderstand. (See Fiske's War of Independence, pp. 58-70.)\r\n\r\n4. _The prevailing mode of colonization._ Many of the colonies had been\r\nfounded for commercial reasons merely, with no intention of forming\r\ngovernmental institutions, Chartered companies and individuals planted\r\nsettlements for the profit there was supposed to be in doing so. These\r\ncolonies were designed to be merely \"self-supporting trading outposts of\r\nEngland.\" Money had been put into these enterprises, and in the effort to\r\nsecure a profitable return many unjust commercial restrictions were\r\nimposed upon the colonists.\r\n\r\nImmediate Causes.--Among the immediate causes of the Revolutionary War may\r\nbe mentioned:\r\n\r\n1. _The French and Indian War._ In the first place, this war facilitated\r\nthe union of the colonies. Several attempts at union had failed; there\r\nwere too many opposing influences. While by far the greater number of the\r\ncolonists were English, there were many Dutch in New York, and some Swedes\r\nremained in Delaware. Moreover, the English themselves differed radically\r\nin politics, those in the South having been royalists, while those in New\r\nEngland sympathized with Cromwell and parliament. But more serious than\r\nthese political differences, were the differences in religion. The old\r\nEuropean quarrels had an echo here, and the catholics of Maryland, the\r\nepiscopalians of Virginia, the puritans of Massachusetts, the baptists of\r\nRhode Island, the lutherans of New York, and the quakers of Pennsylvania,\r\nall had grievances to remember. Travel, which does so much to broaden the\r\nmind and free it from prejudice, was both difficult and dangerous. The\r\nFrench and Indian War, bringing together men from all the colonies, was of\r\ngreat service in breaking down intercolonial animosities. Facing the same\r\ndangers, standing shoulder to shoulder in battle, and mingling with each\r\nother around the camp fires, the men of the several colonies came to know\r\neach other better, and this knowledge ripened into affection. The soldiers\r\non their return home did much to disseminate the good feeling.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the French and Indian War by annihilating all the\r\nclaims of France to American soil removed the principal enemy that had\r\nrendered the protection of England necessary to the colonies.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, this war gave the colonists an experience in military\r\naffairs and a confidence in their own powers which emboldened them to dare\r\nopen rebellion.\r\n\r\nAnd in the fourth place, this war produced the debt which led to the\r\ntaxation which was the most immediate cause of the outbreak.\r\n\r\n2. _Various tyrannical acts of the king_. These are given explicitly in\r\nthe Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nName a country in the world's history that ever allowed its colonies\r\nrepresentation in its home parliament or legislative body. Name one that\r\ndoes it today. Why do territories in this country desire to become states?\r\n\r\nName some country, other than England, which could have given birth to the\r\nUnited States. Prove your proposition.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Choiseul, the French minister who signed the treaty whereby\r\nFrance yielded to England her claims to American soil, remarked after\r\ndoing it, \"That is the beginning of the end of English power in America.\"\r\nWhat did he mean? Upon what did he base his opinion? Why did France help\r\nthe Americans in the Revolutionary War?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant, in speaking of the colonies, by _royal province?_ _Charter_\r\ngovernment? _Proprietary_ government?\r\n\r\nWhat experience in law making did the colonists have? Where and when did\r\nthe first representative assembly in America convene? Find in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence an expression complaining of\r\nnon-representation in parliament.\r\n\r\nTo the patriotic and far sighted men who had striven to form a union of\r\nthe colonies, did the religious differences which frustrated their plans\r\nseem fortunate or unfortunate? Can you see how it came about that we have\r\nno state church, that we enjoy religious freedom? Doesn't it seem that\r\nthere must have been a Planner wiser than any man who was working out His\r\nown designs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT PRECEDED THEM.\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary Period.--The nation was born July 4, 1776. From that\r\ntime until the adoption of the articles of confederation in 1781 the\r\npeople of the United States carried on their governmental affairs by means\r\nof a congress \"clothed with undefined powers for the general good.\"\r\n\r\nThis congress had, speaking \"in the name and by the authority of the good\r\npeople of these colonies,\" issued the declaration of independence; it had\r\nentered into an alliance with France; and it had prosecuted the war almost\r\nto a successful issue, before it had received any definite warrant for its\r\nacts. Its acts were justified by necessity, and had their authority in the\r\n\"common consent\" of a majority of the people. During nearly all of the\r\nrevolutionary war, the people of the colonies were largely \"held together\r\nby their fears.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARTICLES THEMSELVES.\r\n\r\nTheir History.--But these were pre-eminently a people of peace and good\r\norder. This is shown in part by the spirit and form of the declaration of\r\nindependence. They had no idea of allowing themselves to lapse or drift\r\ninto anarchy. They understood the necessity for a permanent government.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when, on the eleventh of June, 1776, a committee of congress\r\nwas appointed to \"abolish\" one form of government by drafting a\r\ndeclaration of independence, another committee was appointed to frame a\r\nplan on which to \"institute a new government.\"\r\n\r\nAfter more than a month's deliberation this committee reported its plan,\r\nembodied in what is called articles of confederation. This plan was\r\ndiscussed from time to time, and finally, somewhat modified, was agreed to\r\nby congress, November 15, 1777. It was then submitted to the states for\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1778, the articles were ratified by ten of the states. New Jersey\r\nratified in November, 1778, and Delaware in February, 1779. But the\r\narticles were not to become binding until ratified by all the states, and\r\nMaryland did not authorize her delegates in congress to sign the\r\ninstrument in ratification until March 1, 1781. (Maryland claims to have\r\nfought through the revolutionary war, not as a member but as an ally of\r\nthe United States.)\r\n\r\nTheir peculiarities.--The articles of confederation were different from\r\nour present constitution, both in principle and in method of operation, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. _The nature of the government formed._ The government was that of a\r\n\"confederation of states,\" each retaining its sovereignty and\r\nindependence. The union was declared to be a \"firm league of friendship.\"\r\nIt was to be perpetual.\r\n\r\n2. _The branches of government._ Only one was provided for, a congress. No\r\nprovision was made for executive or judicial officers apart from the\r\ncongress itself.\r\n\r\n3. _The structure of the congress._ The congress consisted of only one\r\nhouse or chamber. Members were elected for one year, subject to recall at\r\nany time, and they were paid by their respective states. No person was\r\neligible to membership for more than three years in any period of six\r\nyears. No state could be represented by \"less than two, nor more than\r\nseven members.\" Each state had one vote.\r\n\r\n4. _The powers of congress._ \"The United States in congress assembled\" had\r\npower to treat with foreign countries, to send and receive ambassadors, to\r\ndetermine peace and war. Congress was the last resort on appeal in all\r\ndisputes between the states; could fix the standard of weights and\r\nmeasures, and of the fineness of coin; could establish and regulate\r\npostoffices; could ascertain and appropriate \"the necessary sums of money\r\nto be raised for the service of the United States;\" could borrow money \"on\r\nthe credit of the United States;\" could agree upon the number of land\r\nforces and make requisition on each state for its quota; and could appoint\r\na committee consisting of one member from each state, to sit during the\r\nvacations of congress.\r\n\r\n5. _Powers denied to the states._ No state could enter into any treaty\r\nwith another state or with a foreign nation, nor engage in war, except by\r\nconsent of \"the United States in congress assembled;\" nor keep vessels of\r\nwar or a standing army in time of peace, except such number as congress\r\nshould deem necessary.\r\n\r\nReasons for the peculiarities.--Suffering breeds caution. Every one of the\r\npeculiarities was based upon distrust.\r\n\r\nThe people were afraid to trust their delegates. This is manifest in the\r\nshortness of the term, the provision for recall, the reserved right to\r\ncontrol the delegates by controlling their pay, and the limitation as to\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe states were afraid of each other, especially were the small states\r\ndistrustful of the large ones. This is evidenced in the provision that\r\neach state should have one vote. By this arrangement the states had equal\r\npower in the congress.\r\n\r\nThe people and the states were afraid of the general government. A central\r\ngovernment was a necessity, but it was given only very limited powers. The\r\npeople would not have an executive officer, because they feared anything\r\nresembling kingly rule. They did not dare to establish a national\r\njudiciary having jurisdiction over persons and property, because their\r\nexperience with \"trials beyond the sea\" had made them wary of outside\r\ntribunals.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, however, that with all their distrust, in spite of\r\nthe fact that their colonial or state jealousies and habits had returned\r\nupon them, notwithstanding their specific statement in the instrument\r\nitself that \"each state retains its sovereignty,\" the instinct of\r\nnationality was yet strong enough to cause them to continue in the general\r\ngovernment the actual sovereign powers. Thus, the \"United States\" alone\r\ncould treat with foreign nations, declare war, and make peace. Another\r\ngreat sovereign power, that of coining money, was unfortunately shared by\r\nthe states.\r\n\r\nTheir defects.--The great defect in the articles of confederation was that\r\nthey placed too little power in the hands of the general government.\r\nAlthough congress possessed the right to declare war, it could only\r\napportion the quota of men to each state; the states raised the troops.\r\nAnd so on with the other powers. The government of the United States\r\nduring the confederation period was \"a name without a body, a shadow\r\nwithout a substance.\" An eminent statesman of the time remarked that \"by\r\nthis political compact the continental congress have exclusive power for\r\nthe following purposes without being able to execute one of them: They may\r\nmake and conclude treaties; but they can only recommend the observance of\r\nthem. They may appoint ambassadors; but they cannot defray even the\r\nexpenses of their tables. They may borrow money on the faith of the Union;\r\nbut they cannot pay a dollar. They may coin money; but they cannot buy an\r\nounce of bullion. They may make war and determine what troops are\r\nnecessary; but they cannot raise a single soldier. In short, they may\r\ndeclare everything, but they can do nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThe consequences.--\"The history of the confederation during the twelve\r\nyears beyond which it was not able to maintain itself, is the history of\r\nthe utter prostration, throughout the whole country, of every public and\r\nprivate interest,--of that which was, beyond all comparison, the most\r\ntrying period of our national and social life. For it was the extreme\r\nweakness of the confederate government, if such it could be called, which\r\ncaused the war of independence to drag its slow length along through seven\r\ndreary years, and which, but for a providential concurrence of\r\ncircumstances in Europe, must have prevented it from reaching any other\r\nthan a disastrous conclusion. When, at last, peace was proclaimed, the\r\nconfederate congress had dwindled down to a feeble junto of about twenty\r\npersons, and was so degraded and demoralized, that its decisions were\r\nhardly more respected than those of any voluntary and irresponsible\r\nassociation. The treaties which the confederation had made with foreign\r\npowers, it was forced to see violated, and treated with contempt by its\r\nown members; which brought upon it distrust from its friends, and scorn\r\nfrom its enemies. It had no standing among the nations of the world,\r\nbecause it had no power to secure the faith of its national obligations.\r\nFor want of an uniform system of duties and imposts, [Footnote: Each state\r\nregulated its own commerce.] and by conflicting commercial regulations in\r\nthe different states, the commerce of the whole country was prostrated and\r\nwell-nigh ruined.... Bankruptcy and distress were the rule rather than the\r\nexception.... The currency of the country had hardly a nominal value. The\r\nstates themselves were the objects of jealous hostility to each other....\r\nIn some of the states rebellion was already raising its horrid front,\r\nthreatening the overthrow of all regular government and the inauguration\r\nor universal anarchy.\" [Footnote: Dr. J. H. McIlvaine in Princeton Review,\r\nOctober, 1861. Read also Fiske's Critical Period of American History,\r\nchapter IV.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For several years efforts were made by some of our wisest and best\r\npatriots to procure an enlargement of the powers of the continental\r\ncongress, but from the predominance of state jealousies, and the supposed\r\nincompatibility of state interests with each other, they all failed. At\r\nlength, however, it became apparent, that the confederation, being left\r\nwithout resources and without powers, must soon expire of its own\r\ndebility. It had not only lost all vigor, but it had ceased even to be\r\nrespected. It had approached the last stages of its decline; and the only\r\nquestion which remained was whether it should be left to a silent\r\ndissolution, or an attempt should be made to form a more efficient\r\ngovernment before the great interests of the Union were buried beneath its\r\nruins.\" [Footnote: Story]\r\n\r\nPreliminary Movements.--In 1785 a resolution was passed by the legislature\r\nof Massachusetts declaring the articles of confederation inadequate, and\r\nsuggesting a convention of delegates from all the states to amend them. No\r\naction, however, was taken. In the same year commissioners from Virginia\r\nand Maryland met at Alexandria, Va., to arrange differences relative to\r\nthe navigation of the Potomac, the Roanoke, and Chesapeake Bay. The\r\ndeliberations showed the necessity of having other states participate in\r\nthe arrangement of a compact. In 1786 the legislature of Virginia\r\nappointed commissioners \"to meet such as might be appointed by the other\r\nstates of the Union, ... to take into consideration the trade of the\r\nUnited States.\" Only four states accepted the invitation. Commissioners\r\nfrom the five states met at Annapolis, and framed a report advising that\r\nthe states appoint commissioners \"to meet at Philadelphia on the second\r\nMonday in May next, to take into consideration the situation of the United\r\nStates, to devise such further provisions as shall appear to them\r\nnecessary to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to\r\nthe exigencies of the Union.\" [Footnote: Elliot's Debates] In accordance\r\nwith this suggestion, congress passed a resolution, February 21, 1787,\r\nrecommending that a convention of delegates, \"who shall have been\r\nappointed by the several states, be held at Philadelphia, for the sole and\r\nexpress purpose of revising the articles of confederation.\" [Footnote:\r\nElliott's Debates]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Convention.--In response to the call of congress,\r\ndelegates from all the states except Rhode Island met in Philadelphia. By\r\nMay 25, a quorum had assembled, the convention organized, with George\r\nWashington as chairman, and began its momentous work.\r\n\r\nIt was soon discovered that it would be useless to attempt to amend the\r\narticles of confederation. They were radically defective, and a new plan\r\nof government was seen to be necessary. The _national_ idea must be\r\nre-established as the basis of the political organization.\r\n\r\n\"It was objected by some members that they had no power, no authority, to\r\nconstruct a new government. They certainly had no authority, if their\r\ndecisions were to be final; and no authority whatever, under the articles\r\nof confederation, to adopt the course they did. But they knew that their\r\nlabors were only to be suggestions; and that they as well as any private\r\nindividuals, and any private individuals as well as they, had a right to\r\npropose a plan of government to the people for their adoption.... The\r\npeople, by their expressed will, transformed this suggestion, this\r\nproposal, into an organic law, and the people might have done the same\r\nwith a constitution submitted to them by a single citizen.\" [Pomeroy's\r\nConstitutional Law, p. 55]\r\n\r\nThe labors of the convention lasted four months. The constitution was\r\nagreed to September 15, 1787.\r\n\r\nSome of the difficulties encountered.--Of these perhaps the most\r\nformidable was the adjustment of power so as to satisfy both the large and\r\nthe small states. So long as the idea of having the congress consist of\r\none house remained, this difficulty seemed insurmountable. But the\r\nproposal of the bicameral congress proved a happy solution of the\r\nquestion. [Footnote: See discussion of section 1, Article I.,\r\nConstitution, page 124.]\r\n\r\nAlthough so much distress had followed state regulation of commerce, and\r\nalthough most of the delegates from the commercial states were in favor of\r\nvesting this power in the federal government, it was only after much\r\ndeliberation, and after making the concession that no export duties should\r\nbe levied, that the power to regulate commerce was vested in congress.\r\n\r\nAnother perplexing question was the regulation of the slave trade. For two\r\ndays there was a stormy debate on this question. By a compromise congress\r\nwas forbidden to prohibit the importation of slaves prior to 1808, but the\r\nimposition of a tax of ten dollars a head was permitted.\r\n\r\nThe men who constituted the convention.--The convention included such men\r\nas George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, James\r\nMadison, Roger Sherman, Gouverneur Morris, Edmund Randolph, and the\r\nPinckneys. \"Of the destructive element, that which can point out defects\r\nbut cannot remedy them, which is eager to tear down but inapt to build up,\r\nit would be difficult to name a representative in the convention.\"\r\n[Footnote: Cyclopedia of Political Science, vol. I., article\r\n\"Compromises.\"]\r\n\r\nThe constitution a growth.--The constitution was not an entirely new\r\ninvention. The men who prepared it were wise enough not to theorize very\r\nmuch, but rather to avail themselves of the experience of the ages. Almost\r\nevery state furnished some feature. For instance: The title President had\r\nbeen used in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Delaware, and South Carolina;\r\nThe term Senate had been used in eight states; the appointment and\r\nconfirmation of judicial officers had been practiced in all the states;\r\nthe practice of New York suggested the president's message, and that of\r\nMassachusetts his veto; each power of the president had its analogy in\r\nsome state; the office of vice-president came from that of lieutenant\r\ngovernor in several of the states.\r\n\r\nSome of its peculiarities.--And yet the instrument is one of the most\r\nremarkable ever penned by man.\r\n\r\n1. _It is short_. It would not occupy more than about two columns of a\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\n2. _It covers the right ground_. It deals with things permanent, and\r\nleaves transient matters to legislation. Its adaptation to our needs is\r\nseen in the fact that it has remained substantially unchanged, although in\r\nterritory and population our country has grown immensely.\r\n\r\n3. _It is a model in arrangement and language_. The lucidity and\r\nperspicuity of the language of the constitution have called forth\r\nexpressions of admiration from all who have studied it carefully.\r\n\r\nProbably its master-stroke is the creation of the national judiciary.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to a study of the instrument itself, prepared to weigh\r\ncarefully every sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Some Pertinent Questions_.\r\n\r\nGroup all the defects of the government under the articles of\r\nconfederation using these two heads: 1. Defects in organization. 2.\r\nDefects in essential powers.\r\n\r\nIn the constitutional convention there were several \"plans\" proposing\r\nforms of government. State the provisions of the Virginia plan; of the New\r\nJersey plan; of the Hamilton plan; the Connecticut plan.

Second, they show that the constitution is\r\ndifferent in nature from the articles of confederation. The latter was a\r\ncompact between states, adopted by state legislatures acting for the\r\nstates as such; the former was \"ordained and established\" by \"the people\r\nof the United States,\" _one_ people, acting as a unit. And the expression,\r\nwhich was inserted in the preamble after due deliberation, is, therefore,\r\nan argument in favor of the proposition that this is a _nation_ and not a\r\nmere confederacy.\r\n\r\n[3] \"More perfect\" than under the articles of confederation, in which the\r\nstates were declared sovereign and independent. The sovereignty is given\r\nby the constitution to the general government, which is clothed with ample\r\npower to maintain its independence. At the same time such limitations are\r\nplaced upon its power as will prevent its becoming despotic.\r\n\r\n[4] To establish justice is one of the primary purposes of government.\r\nUnder the articles of confederation there had been no national judiciary,\r\nand state courts often discriminated against foreigners and citizens of\r\nother states. To remedy this, to establish fair-handed justice throughout\r\nthe land, the national judiciary was created by the constitution.\r\n\r\n[5] \"Domestic tranquillity\" means here peace among the states and within\r\neach state. The condition of affairs during the confederation period had\r\nbeen woeful. A long war had impoverished the people, and unable to pay\r\ntheir taxes they had in several places broken out in rebellion. Each state\r\nby commercial regulations was trying to better its fortunes even at the\r\nexpense of the others. These regulations, and disputes about boundaries,\r\nkept the states quarreling among themselves.\r\n\r\nBy transferring to the general government the power to regulate commerce\r\nwith foreign nations and among the states, by giving it power to enforce\r\ntreaties, and by creating a tribunal with authority to settle\r\ncontroversies between states, the framers of the constitution removed in a\r\nlarge measure the irritating causes of discord. But to _insure_ peace, the\r\ngeneral government was expressly given power to put down insurrections in\r\nthe states.\r\n\r\n[6] To defend the country is another of the important duties of\r\ngovernment. The United States could do this better than each state could\r\ndefend itself. Several reasons are obvious. Therefore the general\r\ngovernment was empowered to raise and maintain an army and navy, and it\r\nthus became \"competent to inspire confidence at home and respect abroad.\"\r\n\r\n[7] \"To promote the general welfare\" was the great object for which the\r\ngovernment was organized, and all the provisions of the constitution have\r\nthat in view. This expression was intended to cover all those things which\r\na government may properly do for the good of the people. It is very\r\nelastic, as it was intended to be, and has covered acts as different as\r\nthe purchase of Louisiana, and the endowment of agricultural colleges, the\r\ngranting of a patent, and the establishment of post-offices.\r\n\r\n[8] This is a worthy climax to the preamble. The great struggle, which\r\nbegan in the mother country, continued through colonial times, and\r\nculminated in the revolution, had been for liberty. The love of liberty\r\nhad illumined the pathway of the pilgrims crossing unknown seas; it had\r\nglowed in the Declaration of Independence; it had warmed the hearts of the\r\nhalf-clad soldiers at Valley Forge.\r\n\r\nLiberty had now been won; the problem was how to render it secure. The\r\ndesired security was to be found only in the formation of a government\r\nhaving all powers necessary for national sovereignty and independence,\r\nwhile retaining in the states all powers necessary for local\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.--THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n_All legislative powers herein granted, shall be vested in a congress of\r\nthe United States, which shall consist of a senate and house of\r\nrepresentatives._[2]\r\n\r\n[1] The division of governmental functions among three branches has\r\nalready been discussed on page 79.\r\n\r\nThe legislative branch comes first and occupies most space in the\r\nconstitution because its framers regarded the legislative as the most\r\nimportant branch. And laws must be _made_ before they can be interpreted\r\nor executed.\r\n\r\n[2] The _reason_ for the creation of two houses or chambers was that thus\r\nonly could the conflicting claims of the large and small states be\r\nreconciled. It was, in fact, a _compromise_, the first of a series.\r\n\r\nOnly a few in the convention thought at first of having two houses, the\r\nplan being to continue as under the articles of confederation with one\r\nhouse. On the question of apportioning representatives, it was found that\r\nthere was a decided difference of opinion. The small states wished to\r\ncontinue the principle of the articles of confederation, which gave the\r\nseveral states equal power. But the large states insisted that the power\r\nof a state should be _in proportion to its population_. The differences\r\nwere finally settled by the creation of two houses, in one of which the\r\nstates should have equal power, and in the other the representation should\r\nbe based upon population.\r\n\r\nConnecticut has the honor of furnishing this valuable compromise. In her\r\nlegislature, representation in one house was based on population; in the\r\nother, the towns had equal representation.\r\n\r\nAmong the _advantages_ of having two houses, aside from that mentioned on\r\npage 80, are these: It tends to prevent a few popular leaders from\r\ncarrying through laws not designed for the common good; it secures a\r\nreview of any proposed measure by men elected in different ways and\r\nlooking at it from different standpoints. As our congress is organized,\r\nthe members of the house of representatives, being elected by popular vote\r\nand for a short term, are likely to represent with considerable\r\nfaithfulness the wishes of the people. But the people may be for a time\r\nwrong--as, for instance, in the persecution of the \"witches\"--and\r\nsenators, who by their mode of election and length of term are made\r\nsomewhat independent, can comparatively without fear do what seems right,\r\neven if temporarily unsupported by public opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.[1]\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Composition and Term._\r\n\r\n_The house of representatives shall be composed of members chosen every\r\nsecond year[2] by the people[3] of the several states, and the electors[4]\r\nin each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the\r\nmost numerous branch of the state legislature.[5]_\r\n\r\n[1] So called because it represents the people.\r\n\r\n[2] The term under the confederation had been one year. This was too short\r\nto permit any adequate study of the subjects to be legislated upon. This\r\nlonger term, two years, is still short enough to impose upon\r\nrepresentatives the feeling of responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe term begins March 4, at noon. The time covered by a representative's\r\nterm is called _a congress;_ thus we speak of the fortieth congress,\r\nmeaning the fortieth two years of our constitutional existence. The name\r\nalso applies to the body constituting our national legislative department\r\nduring that time. Thus we say that a certain person is a member of\r\ncongress.\r\n\r\n\"A congress\" includes two regular sessions and any number of extra\r\nsessions which the president may see fit to call or which may be provided\r\nfor by law. The first regular session is called \"the long session,\"\r\nbecause congress may remain in session through the summer, if it choose.\r\nThe second is called \"the short session,\" because it must end March 4, at\r\nnoon. Expiring thus by limitation, it lasts not more than about three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[3] The word _people_ here means _voters_.\r\n\r\nEach state is divided by its legislature into congressional districts\r\nequal in number to the representatives to which it is entitled, and the\r\npeople of each district elect one representative. Sometimes when a state\r\nhas its representation increased after a new census, the old congressional\r\ndistricts are left for a time undisturbed, and the added representatives\r\nare elected \"at large,\" while the others are chosen by districts as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n[4] Voters.\r\n\r\n[5] The qualifications for voting in any state are fixed by the state\r\nitself, and different states require different qualifications. When the\r\nconstitution was framed, but not now, some states required higher\r\nqualifications in voters for the upper house of the state legislature than\r\nin voters for the lower; so that more persons could vote for members of\r\nthe lower, which is always the \"most numerous\" branch, than for the\r\nhigher. Desiring to make the United States house of representatives as\r\n\"popular\" as possible, the framers of the constitution determined that all\r\nwhom any state was willing to trust to vote for a member of the lower\r\nhouse of the state legislature, the United States could trust to vote for\r\nmembers of its lower house.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Qualifications_.\r\n\r\n_No person shall be a representative who shall not have attained the age\r\nof twenty-five years,[1] and been seven years a citizen of the United\r\nStates,[2] and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state\r\nin which he shall he chosen.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] For business and voting purposes a man \"comes of age\" at twenty-one\r\nyears. Four years of probation are considered the least amount of time\r\nnecessary to fit him for the responsibilities of a member of the house of\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[2] A born citizen will at twenty-five years of age have been a citizen\r\nfor twenty-five years. A naturalized citizen must have lived in the United\r\nStates for at least twelve years, [Footnote: Eight years in the case of an\r\nhonorably discharged soldier who may become a citizen on one year's\r\nresidence.] five years to become a citizen and seven years afterwards,\r\nbefore being eligible to the house of representatives. These twelve years\r\nwill have given him time to become \"Americanized.\"\r\n\r\n[3] Residence in the state is required in order that the state may be\r\nrepresented by persons interested in its welfare. No length of time is\r\nspecified, however. Residence in the district is not required by the\r\nconstitution, because the distribution of representatives within a state\r\nis left to the state itself. A person _may_ be chosen to represent a\r\ndistrict in which he does not live, and this has been done in a few\r\ninstances. One does not lose his seat by moving from the district or even\r\nfrom the state, but propriety would impel resignation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\n1. Persons holding any office under the United States. [I., 6, 2.]\r\n\r\n2. Persons who by engaging in rebellion against the United States have\r\nviolated their oath to support the constitution, unless the disability be\r\nremoved. [Am. XIV., 3.]\r\n\r\n_Clause 3.--Apportionment._\r\n\r\nThe parts of this clause enclosed in brackets are now obsolete.\r\n\r\n_Representatives and direct taxes[1] shall be apportioned among the\r\nseveral states which may be included within this Union, according to their\r\nrespective numbers,[2] [which shall he determined by adding to the whole\r\nnumber of free persons[3] including those bound to service [4] for a\r\nnumber of years, and] excluding Indians not taxed, [three-fifths of all\r\nother persons.[5]] The actual enumeration[6] shall he made within three\r\nyears after the first meeting of the congress of the United States,[7] and\r\nwithin every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by\r\nlaw direct. The number of representatives shall not exceed one for every\r\nthirty thousand,[8] but each state shall have at least one\r\nrepresentative,[9] [and until such enumeration shall he made, the State of\r\nNew Hampshire, shall be entitled to choose three, Massachusetts eight,\r\nRhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New York\r\nsix, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six,\r\nVirginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia\r\nthree.]_\r\n\r\n[1] These are like the usual local taxes; that is, \"poll\" taxes and taxes\r\non real and personal property. A tax on incomes derived from such property\r\nwas, in May, 1895, declared by the United States Supreme Court to be a\r\ndirect tax. United States direct taxes have been laid only in 1798, 1813,\r\n1815, 1816, 1862.\r\n\r\n[2] The revolutionary war had just been fought to maintain the principle,\r\n\"taxation and representation go hand in hand,\" and this provision was made\r\nin harmony therewith. The including of direct taxes was a concession to\r\nthe slaveholding states.\r\n\r\n[3] Men, women and children. [4] Apprentices.\r\n\r\n[5] Slaves. The framers of the constitution did not like to use the word\r\n\"slave,\" and therefore used this expression. Most of them, even the\r\nslaveholders, hoped that slavery would soon cease to be.\r\n\r\nIn determining the persons to be enumerated, much difficulty was\r\nencountered. The slaveholding states wished the slaves counted as\r\nindividuals, claiming that they had as much right to be represented as had\r\nwomen, children and other non-voters. The non-slaveholding [Footnote: In\r\nall the states except Massachusetts slavery then existed. But in the\r\nnorthern states the number of slaves was so small, that we may call them\r\n\"non-slaveholding.\"] states thought that being held as property they\r\nshould not be counted at all for purposes of representation. This\r\nprovision in the constitution was the outcome,--another compromise.\r\n\r\n[6] Called the _Census_. The prime purpose in taking the census is to find\r\nout the number of people in each state, so that representation may be\r\nequalized. But the census takers collect at the same time a vast amount of\r\nother useful information upon the agriculture, manufactures, commerce,\r\netc., of the country. Reports of the census are published by the\r\ngovernment for gratuitous distribution.\r\n\r\n[7] The first meeting of congress was held in 1789, and the first census\r\nwas taken in 1790.\r\n\r\n[8] To prevent the House from becoming too large. But the population of\r\nthe United States has constantly and rapidly increased, so that the \"ratio\r\nof representation,\" as it is called, has been made greater at each census.\r\nIt now takes 173,901 people to secure a representative. (For ratio in each\r\ndecade, see pages 312-13.)\r\n\r\n[9] So that even the smallest states shall be represented.\r\n\r\n_Clause 4.--Vacancies._\r\n\r\n_When vacancies[1] happen in the representation from any state, the\r\nexecutive authority[2] thereof shall issue writs of election[3] to fill\r\nsuch vacancies.[4]_\r\n\r\n[1] Vacancies usually happen through the death or resignation of the\r\nincumbent. But a vacancy may be made by the expulsion of a member or by\r\nthe election of an ineligible person.\r\n\r\n[2] The governor or acting governor.\r\n\r\n[3] That is, he orders an election. The order is printed in the newspapers\r\nof the district, and specifies the time the election is to be held. At the\r\ntime specified the electors vote as in regular elections. This is called a\r\n\"special election.\"\r\n\r\n[4] The person elected serves for the unexpired term.\r\n\r\n_Clause 5.--House Powers.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives shall choose their speaker[1] and other\r\nofficers;[2] and shall have the sole power of impeachment[3]._\r\n\r\n[1] Called so in imitation of the title of the presiding officer of the\r\nBritish House of Commons, who was originally called the speaker because he\r\nacted as spokesman in communicating to the king the wishes of the House.\r\n\r\nThe speaker is chosen by ballot from among the members, and serves during\r\nthe pleasure of the House. At the beginning of each congress a new\r\nelection is held. A speaker may be re-elected. Henry Clay served as\r\nspeaker for ten years.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the speaker are prescribed by the rules of the House. So\r\nfar, he has always appointed the committees. As the work of legislation is\r\nlargely shaped by committees, it may be fairly asked whether any one else\r\ncan so affect the legislation of the country as can the speaker--whether,\r\nindeed, he has not too much power.\r\n\r\n[2] The most important \"other officers\" are the clerk and the\r\nsergeant-at-arms.\r\n\r\nThe clerk, as his title would indicate, has charge of the records of the\r\nHouse. He has a number of assistants.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant-at-arms acts under the orders of the speaker in keeping order\r\nand in serving processes. His duties in the House resemble those of the\r\nsheriff in court.\r\n\r\nThe doorkeeper, postmaster, and chaplain, have duties indicated by their\r\ntitles.\r\n\r\nThese officers are elected by the House and serve during its pleasure,\r\nusually two years. Assistants are appointed by the officers whom they\r\nassist.\r\n\r\nNone of these officers are members of the House.\r\n\r\n[3] An impeachment is a solemn accusation in writing, formally charging a\r\npublic officer with crime. \"The articles of impeachment are a sort of\r\nindictment; and the House, in presenting them, acts as a grand jury, and\r\nalso as a public prosecutor.\" [Footnote: Story's Exposition of the\r\nConstitution of the United States.]\r\n\r\nFor further discussion of impeachment, see pages 138, 203 and 331. A very\r\ninteresting account of the impeachment trial of Secretary Belknap is given\r\nin Alton's _Among the Lawmakers_, pages 245-250.

Is a woman eligible?\r\nCould the state impose other qualifications than those mentioned in the\r\nconstitution?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--THE SENATE.[1]\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Composition._\r\n\r\n_The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators from\r\neach state,[2] chosen by the legislature thereof,[3] for six years;[4] and\r\neach senator shall have one vote.[5]_\r\n\r\n[1] Latin _senatus_, from _senex_, an old man. This dignified term seems a\r\nfavorite, being used in many countries to designate the upper house. In\r\nother countries a term is used having the same signification.\r\n\r\n[2] This arrangement will be remembered as the concession made by the\r\nlarge states to the small ones.\r\n\r\nHad the number of senators been fixed at one from each state, equality of\r\npower among the states would still have been secured; but sickness or\r\naccident might then leave a state unrepresented. By having two, this\r\ndifficulty is obviated. The two can consult about the needs of their state;\r\nand the Senate is large enough to \"confer power and encourage firmness.\"\r\nThree from each state would bring no advantages which are not now secured,\r\nwhile the Senate would be unnecessarily large and expensive.\r\n\r\n[3] This mode of election was fixed upon for two reasons: First, the\r\nsenators represent the state, as such, and hence it seemed proper that\r\nthey should be chosen by the body which acts for the state in its\r\ncorporate capacity; second, the members of the House of Representatives\r\nbeing elected by the people, it was deemed advisable to elect the senators\r\nin a different way, in order that, by representing different elements,\r\neach house might act as a check upon the other. Incidentally, election by\r\nthe legislature was considered good, because it would serve as a\r\nconnecting link between the states and the United States.\r\n\r\n[4] The long term gives dignity and independence to the position of\r\nsenator; it gives assurance of stability in the national councils, and\r\ntends to secure for them confidence at home and respect abroad; it raises\r\nsenators \"above the whims and caprices of their constituents, so that they\r\nmay consult their solid interests, rather than their immediate wishes.\"\r\n\r\n[5] Under the confederation each state had from two to seven members of\r\ncongress, but only one vote. If the delegation was equally divided on any\r\nquestion, or if only one member was present, the state lost its vote.\r\n\r\nBy the present arrangement a state need not go entirely unrepresented on\r\naccount of the absence of one of its senators.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Classification and Vacancies._\r\n\r\n_Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first\r\nelection, they shall be divided, as equally as may be, into three\r\nclasses.[1] The seats of the senators of the first class shall be vacated\r\nat the expiration of the second year; of the second class, at the\r\nexpiration of the fourth year; and of the third class, at the expiration\r\nof the sixth year;[2] so that one-third may be chosen every second year;\r\nand if vacancies happen by resignation, or otherwise, during the recess of\r\nthe legislature of any state, the executive thereof may make temporary\r\nappointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which shall then\r\nfill such vacancies.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] The object of this division is to secure for the Senate at all times a\r\nlarge proportion of experienced members. By this arrangement, too, the\r\nSenate becomes a permanent body, ready at any time to convene for the\r\nconsideration of treaties, for the trial of impeachments, or for\r\nconfirming executive appointments.\r\n\r\n[2] Only ten states were represented when, on May 15, 1789, this\r\nclassification was first made. (North Carolina and Rhode Island had not\r\nyet ratified the constitution, and New York's senators had not yet\r\npresented their credentials.) The twenty senators had on the preceding day\r\nbeen grouped by name into three classes, two of seven senators each, and\r\none of six. By the drawing of three numbered slips of paper, seven fell\r\ninto class 1, seven into class 2, and six into class 3, with terms ending\r\nMarch 3, 1791, 1793, and 1795, respectively. After the classification had\r\nbeen fixed, the two senators from New York appeared. One was placed, by\r\nlot, in class 3 (thus filling the classes), and then the other, also by\r\nlot, in class 1. The two senators from the next state, North Carolina,\r\nwere therefore placed in the unfilled classes 2 and 3. Since 1795, each\r\nclass holds for six years, and a senator's term expires with that of his\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n[3] Senators represent the state, and are elected by the body which acts\r\nfor the state,--by the legislature if in session, temporarily by the\r\ngovernor if it is not.\r\n\r\n_Clause 3.--Qualifications_.\r\n\r\n_No person shall be a senator, who shall not have attained to the age of\r\nthirty years,[1] and been nine years a citizen of the United States,[2]\r\nand who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state from which\r\nhe shall be chosen.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] This was also the age for eligibility to the Roman Senate. It is five\r\nyears more than the requirement for membership in the House.\r\n\r\n[2] Two years of citizenship more than required of a representative. As\r\nthe Senate acts with the president in making treaties, this requirement\r\nseems none too great.\r\n\r\n[3] The propriety of this is self-evident. (I. 2: 2.)\r\n\r\n_Clause 4.--Presiding Officer._\r\n\r\n_The vice-president of the United States shall be president of the\r\nSenate,[1] but shall have no vote,[2] unless they be equally divided.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] This arrangement was made for three reasons:\r\n\r\nFirst. It would give the vice-president something to do.\r\n\r\nSecond. Partaking in the executive business of the Senate would give the\r\nvice-president excellent training for the duties of the presidency, in\r\ncase he should be called thereto.\r\n\r\nThird. The equality of power among the states would remain undisturbed.\r\nHad it been arranged that the Senate should choose its own presiding\r\nofficer from among its members, one state might thereby gain (or lose)\r\npower in the Senate.\r\n\r\n[2] Because he is not a member of the Senate. For this reason, also, he\r\ncannot take part in debates, nor can he appoint committees. These are\r\nelected by the Senate itself.\r\n\r\n[3] But for his casting vote; a \"dead-lock\" might occur on some important\r\nquestion. This \"might give rise to dangerous feuds, or intrigues, and\r\ncreate state or national agitations.\"\r\n\r\n_Clause 5.--Other Officers._\r\n\r\n_The Senate shall choose their other officers,[1] and also a president pro\r\ntempore,[2] in the absence of the vice-president, or when he shall\r\nexercise the office of president of the United States._\r\n\r\n[1] These are similar to those of the House. (See p. 131.)\r\n\r\n[2] The president _pro tempore_ is chosen from among the senators. Being a\r\nsenator, he can debate and vote upon any question. He cannot, of course,\r\ngive a \"casting vote,\" because that would virtually give him two votes.\r\n\r\nThe president _pro tempore_ serves during the pleasure of the Senate, or\r\nuntil the expiration of his senatorial term.\r\n\r\nIt is the general practice for the vice-president to vacate his chair at\r\nthe beginning of the session, to permit the Senate to chose a president\r\n_pro tempore_, so that if during vacation the vice-president should become\r\npresident, the Senate might not be without a presiding officer. Until\r\nrecently this was quite important, for the president _pro tempore_ of the\r\nSenate was next to the vice-president in the succession to the presidency.\r\nBut the succession has been changed. (See p. 190.)\r\n\r\n_Clause 6.--Impeachment._\r\n\r\n_The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.[1] When\r\nsitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation.[2] When\r\nthe president of the United States is tried, the chief Justice shall\r\npreside;[3] and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of\r\ntwo-thirds of the members present.[4] Judgement in cases of impeachment\r\nshall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification\r\nto hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit, under the United\r\nSates;[5] but the party convicted shall, nevertheless, be liable and\r\nsubject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to\r\nlaw.[6]_\r\n\r\n[1] For the mode of conducting impeachments, see pages 131 and 331.\r\n\r\nTo have impeachments tried by a court of law would be unwise for several\r\nreasons: In the first place, judges should be kept free from political\r\ncontests, in order that they may retain the proper judicial frame of mind.\r\nIn the second place, judges are appointed by the executive, who may be the\r\none impeached. Lastly, a judge is himself subject to impeachment.\r\n\r\n[2] To enhance the solemnity of the occasion. The British House of Lords\r\nwhen sitting as a high court of impeachment is not under oath. But courts\r\nusually are.\r\n\r\n[3] The vice-president, having interest in the result, would be\r\ndisqualified. The chief justice, from the dignity of his station and his\r\ngreat experience in law, seems the fittest person to preside on such a\r\ngrave occasion. Except in this single instance, however, the\r\nvice-president presides in trials on impeachment.\r\n\r\n[4] In an ordinary court, the verdict of the jury must be unanimous. To\r\nrequire similar agreement in this case would be to make it next to\r\nimpossible ever to convict. To allow a bare majority to convict would be\r\nto place too little protection over a public officer.\r\n\r\n[5] But for this provision abuses of power might occur in times of\r\npolitical excitement and strife. The question which the Senate settles is\r\nsimply whether, in view of the evidence, the accused is or is not worthy\r\nto hold public office.\r\n\r\n[6] This provision was inserted to prevent an official who had been\r\ndeposed for crime from pleading the principle that \"No one can be twice\r\ntried and punished for the same offense.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITTEN EXERCISE.\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE TABULATION.\r\n\r\nPOINTS CONSIDERED.

When were they elected? Were\r\nthey elected to fill a vacancy or for a full term? How many times has each\r\nbeen elected?\r\n\r\nHow many more senators has New York that Rhode Island? How many members in\r\nthe present Senate? How many in each class? When the next state is\r\nadmitted, in what classes will its senators be placed? How will the class\r\nof each be decided?\r\n\r\nWhy not have senators chosen for life?\r\n\r\nIf one of our senators should resign today, to whom would the resignation\r\nbe addressed? How would the vacancy be filled? How long would the\r\nappointee serve? Could the governor appoint himself?\r\n\r\nHow long at least must an alien live in the United States before being\r\neligible to the Senate? Has anyone ever been refused admission, after\r\nbeing duly elected, on account of shortness of citizenship?\r\n\r\nWho is now vice-president? Who is president _pro tempore_ of the Senate?\r\nWhy is it not correct under any circumstances to speak of the president\r\n_pro tempore_ as vice-president?\r\n\r\nHas the vice-president's vote ever helped to carry any measures of great\r\nimportance?\r\n\r\nIf every senator be \"present,\" what number of senators would it take to\r\nconvict? Does the accused continue to perform his official duties during\r\nthe trial? Was President Johnson impeached? Is there any appeal from the\r\nSenate's verdict? How do senators vote in cases of impeachment? How is\r\njudgment pronounced?\r\n\r\nWhat punishments follow conviction on impeachment in other countries?\r\n\r\nWhat is treason? Bribery? What are crimes? High crimes? Misdemeanors?\r\n\r\nHow is an impeachment trial conducted? (See appendix.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--ELECTIONS AND MEETINGS.\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Elections to Congress._\r\n\r\n_The times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and\r\nrepresentatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature\r\nthereof: but the congress may at any time, by law, make or alter such\r\nregulations,[1] except as to the place of choosing senators.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] Until 1842 these matters were left entirely with the several states.\r\nCongress then provided that representatives should be elected by districts\r\nof contiguous territory, equal to the number of representatives. It has\r\nsince provided that elections for representatives shall be by ballot, and\r\nthat the election shall be on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of\r\nNovember in the even numbered years.\r\n\r\nThe time and mode of electing senators are given on page 333.\r\n\r\n[2] This would in effect be giving congress power to locate the capital of\r\na state.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Meetings._\r\n\r\n_The congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting\r\nshall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by law appoint\r\na different day._\r\n\r\nThey have _not_ by law appointed a different day.\r\n\r\n\"Annual meetings of the legislature have long been deemed, both in England\r\nand America, a great security to liberty and justice.\" By making provision\r\nin the constitution for annual meetings, the duty could not be evaded.\r\n\r\nExtra sessions of congress may be called at any time by the president or\r\nbe provided by law. There used to be three sessions, one beginning March\r\n4.\r\n\r\nThe _place_ of meeting is not named, because the capital had not been\r\nlocated, and in some cases it might be desirable to hold the session\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V. SEPARATE POWERS AND DUTIES.\r\n\r\n_Clause 1. Membership: Quorum._\r\n\r\n_Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns and\r\nqualifications of its own members,[1] and a majority of each shall\r\nconstitute a quorum to do business;[2] but a smaller number may adjourn\r\nfrom day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent\r\nmembers, in such manner, and under such penalties, as each house may\r\nprovide.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] This means simply that each house has the power to determine who are\r\nentitled to membership in it. This has long been recognized in free\r\ncountries as a right belonging to a legislative body, necessary to the\r\nmaintenance of its independence and purity--even its existence. But when\r\nthe parties are nearly balanced, the majority is tempted to seat its\r\nfellow-partizan.\r\n\r\n[1] This is the number usually established as a quorum for a deliberative\r\nbody. Certainly no smaller number should have a right to transact\r\nbusiness, for that would give too much power to an active minority. And to\r\nrequire more than a majority, would make it possible for a minority to\r\nprevent legislation.\r\n\r\n[3] Under the rules no member has a right to be absent from a session\r\nunless excused or sick. Unexcused absentees, unless sick, may be arrested\r\nand brought to the capitol by the sergeant-at-arms or a special messenger.\r\n\r\nWhen fewer than fifteen members are present, they usually adjourn.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Discipline._\r\n\r\n_Each house may determine the rules of its proceedings,[1] punish its\r\nmembers for disorderly behavior, and with the concurrence of two-thirds,\r\nexpel a member.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] The rules are intended to facilitate business, by preventing confusion\r\nand unnecessary delay. They are designed also to check undue haste.\r\n\r\nThe rules of each house are based upon the English parliamentary practice,\r\nas are the rules of all legislative or deliberative bodies wherever the\r\nEnglish language is spoken. (See \"Manuals\" of Senate and House.)\r\n\r\n[2] It seems unlikely that even in times of great excitement two-thirds of\r\neither house would favor expulsion unless it were deserved. This is also,\r\nit will be observed, the number necessary to convict in case of\r\nimpeachment.\r\n\r\n_Clause 3.--Publicity._\r\n\r\n_Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and, from time to\r\ntime, publish the same,[1] excepting such parts as may, in their judgment,\r\nrequire secrecy;[2] and the yeas and nays[3] of the members of either\r\nhouse, shall at the desire of one-fifth of those present, be entered on\r\nthe journal.[4]_\r\n\r\n[1] This is to give publicity to the proceedings of congress, for the\r\nbenefit of both legislators and constituents. This provision is a valuable\r\none, in spite of the fact that demagogues are sometimes able thereby to\r\ngain cheap glory.\r\n\r\nTo give still further publicity to the proceedings, spectators and\r\nnewspaper reporters are admitted to the gallery of each house, and members\r\nmay have their speeches printed and distributed.\r\n\r\n[2] The House of Representatives rarely has a secret session. But the\r\nSenate still keeps its executive sessions secret.\r\n\r\n[3] For methods of voting see page 314.\r\n\r\n[4] The purpose of this provision is to make members careful how they\r\nvote, for the record is preserved. It will be noticed that the number\r\nnecessary to secure the record is small.\r\n\r\nWhile this provision is intended to protect the minority, by enabling them\r\nto impose responsibility upon the majority, it is open to abuse. It is\r\nsometimes used by a minority to delay unnecessarily the proper transaction\r\nof business. (For a graphic account of \"filibustering,\" see Among the Law\r\nMakers, 165-173.)\r\n\r\n_Clause 4--Adjournment._\r\n\r\n_Neither house, during the session of congress, shall without the consent\r\nof the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place\r\nthan that in which the two houses shall be sitting._\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this provision is evident.\r\n\r\nThe sessions of congress may end in any one of three ways:\r\n\r\n1. The terms of representatives may end.\r\n\r\n2. The houses may agree to adjourn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SENATE CHAMBER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATE, WAR AND NAVY DEPARTMENTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR DEPARTMENT]\r\n\r\n3. In case of disagreement between the houses as to the time of\r\nadjournment, the president may adjourn them. (This contingency has never\r\nyet arisen, however.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI. MEMBERS.\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Privileges._\r\n\r\n_The senators and representatives shall receive a compensation for the\r\nservices,[1] to be ascertained by law,[2] and paid out of the treasury of\r\nthe United States.[3] They shall in all cases except treason,[4]\r\nfelony,[4] and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their\r\nattendance at the session of their respective houses, and in going to and\r\nreturning from the same;[5] and for any speech or debate in either house,\r\nthey shall not be questioned in any other place.[6]_\r\n\r\n[1] See discussion in connection with state legislature, p. 85.\r\n\r\n[2] The salary of congressmen is, therefore, fixed by themselves, subject\r\nonly to the approval of the president. It is now $5000 a year, and\r\nmileage. The speaker receives $8000 a year and mileage. The president _pro\r\ntempore_ of the Senate receives the same while serving as president of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n[3] They are serving the United States.\r\n\r\n[4] Defined on pages 158 and 211.\r\n\r\n[5] So that their constituents may not for frivolous or sinister reasons\r\nbe deprived of representation.\r\n\r\n[6] That is, he cannot be sued for slander in a court of justice, but he\r\ncan be checked by his house, if necessary, and the offensive matter\r\nomitted from the Record.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this provision is not to shield cowards in speaking ill of\r\npersons who do not deserve reproach, but to protect right-minded members\r\nin exposing iniquity, no matter how the doers of it may be intrenched in\r\nwealth or power.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Restrictions._\r\n\r\n_No senator or representative shall, during the time for which he was\r\nelected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the\r\nUnited States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof\r\nshall have been increased during such time;[1] and no person holding any\r\noffice under the United States shall be a member of either house during\r\nhis continuance in office.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] The obvious purpose of this provision is to remove from members of\r\ncongress the temptation to create offices with large salaries for their\r\nown benefit, or to increase for a similar reason the salaries of offices\r\nalready existing. It was designed also to secure congress from undue\r\ninfluence on the part of the president.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of the provision has, however, been seriously questioned. \"As\r\nthere is a degree of depravity in mankind, which requires a certain degree\r\nof circumspection and distrust, so there are other qualities in human\r\nnature, which justify a certain portion of esteem and confidence.\r\nRepublican government presupposes the existence of these qualities in a\r\nhigher form, than any other. It might well be deemed harsh to disqualify\r\nan individual from any office, clearly required by the exigencies of the\r\ncountry, simply because he had done his duty.... The chances of receiving\r\nan appointment to a new office are not so many, or so enticing, as to\r\nbewilder many minds; and if they are, the aberrations from duty are so\r\neasily traced, that they rarely, if ever, escape the public reproaches.\r\nAnd if influence is to be exerted by the executive, for improper purposes,\r\nit will be quite as easy, and its operation less seen, and less suspected,\r\nto give the stipulated patronage in another form.\" [Footnote: Judge\r\nStory.]\r\n\r\n[2] This was to obviate state jealousy, to allay the fears entertained by\r\nsome that the general government would obtain undue influence in the\r\nnational councils.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABULAR VIEW.\r\n\r\nEach pupil may make out a tabulation, giving briefly the facts called for\r\nin this outline:\r\n\r\nI.

Where are the United States senators from this state\r\nelected?\r\n\r\nHow are United States senators elected? See appendix.\r\n\r\nIs congress now in session? Will the next session be the long or the short\r\none? When, within your recollection, was there an \"extra session\" of\r\ncongress? Could the president convene one house without the other? Which\r\nis the longest session of congress on record? Does congress meet too\r\noften?\r\n\r\nWhere does congress now meet? Is that the best place? At what different\r\nplaces has congress met since the adoption of the constitution?\r\n\r\nIf two persons should claim the same seat in the House of Representatives,\r\nwho would decide between them? How would the contest be carried on? (See\r\npage 330.) Has there ever been a \"contested\" election from this state?\r\n\r\nWhat number of representatives is the least that could transact business?\r\nThe least number of senators? The least number of representatives that\r\ncould possibly pass a bill? Of senators? What is done if at any time\r\nduring the proceedings it is found that there is \"no quorum present?\"\r\n\r\nHas a member ever been expelled from either house? May either house punish\r\nfor disorder persons who are not members? Can either house temporarily set\r\naside all of its rules?\r\n\r\nDid you ever see a copy of the Congressional Record? If congress be now in\r\nsession, make a weekly report of its proceedings. How could you see\r\ncongress in session? Could you be a spectator at a committee meeting? How\r\ncould you witness an \"executive session\" of the Senate?\r\n\r\nCan a member be punished for an offense committed before he was elected?\r\n\r\nHow is voting usually done in a deliberative assembly? How in Congress?\r\nHow are territories represented in congress?\r\n\r\nDistinguish between the \"capital\" and the \"capitol\" of the United States.\r\nWho has power to locate the capital of the United States?\r\n\r\nHas the salary of congressmen ever been more than $5000 a year? How were\r\ncongressmen paid under the confederation?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by the House resolving itself into a _committee of the\r\nwhole?_\r\n\r\nWhen does the freedom from arrest of a member of congress begin? When does\r\nit end? Could a summons be served upon him during that time?\r\n\r\nWhat is slander? Libel? Is a member of congress liable for the publication\r\nof his speech in the Congressional Record? Would he be responsible if he\r\nshould have it published in any other than the official way?\r\n\r\nCan a member of congress resign to accept an office already in existence,\r\nand whose emoluments have not been increased during his term? Give\r\nexamples. If a United States officer be elected to congress, how long can\r\nhe retain his office? Could a member of congress be appointed to a\r\n_military_ office created during his term? Can a member be appointed\r\n_after his term is out_ to an office created during his term?\r\n\r\nIs a member of congress an officer of the United States?\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.--LAW MAKING.\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Revenue Bills._\r\n\r\n_All bills for raising revenue[1] shall originate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives;[2] but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments,\r\nas on other bills.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] That is, bills in relation to the levying of taxes or for bringing\r\nmoney into the treasury in any other way.\r\n\r\n[2] Because the representatives are nearer to the people, who must pay the\r\ntaxes, and can therefore be more readily held to account.\r\n\r\n[3] Such bills in England originate in the House of Commons, and the House\r\nof Lords has no power of amendment.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of giving the Senate power to amend is to preserve the due\r\ninfluence of the small states in this important matter.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Mode of Making Laws._\r\n\r\n_Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the\r\nSenate,[1] shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the president\r\nof the United States;[2] if he approve, he shall sign it; but if not, he\r\nshall return it, with his objections, to that house in which it shall have\r\noriginated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and\r\nproceed to reconsider it. If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of\r\nthat house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with\r\nthe objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be\r\nconsidered, and, if approved by two-thirds of that house, it shall become\r\na law.[3] But in all such cases the votes of both houses shall be\r\ndetermined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and\r\nagainst the bill shall be entered on the journal of each house,\r\nrespectively.[4] If any bill shall not he returned by the president within\r\nten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the\r\nsame shall he a law, in like manner as if he had signed it,[5] unless the\r\ncongress, by their adjournment, prevent its return, in which case it shall\r\nnot be a law.[6] [1] Or the Senate and House of Representatives, since any\r\nbills except those for raising revenue may originate in either house.\r\n\r\n[2] The two great purposes of giving the president a negative upon\r\nlegislative acts, are to protect the proper authority of the executive\r\nfrom the encroachments of the congress, and to interpose a stay on hasty\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n[3] The veto of the Roman Tribune was final, as is that of almost every\r\nEuropean sovereign today. _But no British king or queen has vetoed an act\r\nof Parliament in the last hundred and eighty years._ In Norway, if a bill,\r\nvetoed by the king, passes three successive Storthings, it becomes a law.\r\n\r\n[4] To secure a permanent record for future reference. This helps to\r\nrender members careful how they vote.\r\n\r\n[5] This gives due time for consideration, but prevents the president's\r\nkilling a bill by ignoring or neglecting it.\r\n\r\n[6] Thus congress (which has the very human failing of \"putting off\" or\r\npostponing) cannot break down the veto power of the president, by pouring\r\nan avalanche of bills upon him within the last few days of the session.\r\n\r\nBut the president can easily kill any bill which he does not like, if it\r\nis presented within ten days of the adjournment of congress, simply by\r\nkeeping it. This is called \"pocketing\" a bill, or \"the pocket veto.\"\r\n\r\n_Clause 3.--Joint Resolutions._\r\n\r\n_Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate\r\nand House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of\r\nadjournment), shall be presented to the president of the United States;\r\nand before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or, being\r\ndisapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and\r\nHouse of Representatives, according to the rules and limitations\r\nprescribed in the case of a bill._\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this provision is to prevent congress from passing a law\r\nunder some other name.\r\n\r\nThe resolution to adjourn is excepted, because, as we have seen, the time\r\nfor adjournment is generally a matter of agreement between the houses.\r\n\r\nA resolution passed by the two houses, but not intended to have the force\r\nof law, such as an agreement to do something, is called a concurrent\r\nresolution, and does not require the president's signature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWhat is a \"bill?\" What is meant by entering the objections \"at large?\" Why\r\nis there no committee of ways and means in the Senate?\r\n\r\nHow many members in each house does it take for the first passage of a\r\nbill?

Also, Among the Lawmakers, Chapter 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.--POWERS VESTED IN CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Taxation._\r\n\r\n_Congress shall have power:_\r\n\r\n_To lay and collect taxes[1], duties, imposts and excises, to pay the\r\ndebts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United\r\nStates;[2] but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout\r\nthe United States.[3]_\r\n\r\nFor discussion of methods of taxation, see page 316.\r\n\r\n[1] The want of power in congress to impose taxes was, perhaps, the\r\ngreatest defect of the articles of confederation; therefore in the\r\nconstitution this was the first power granted to congress.\r\n\r\n[2] As usually interpreted, the phrase beginning, \"to pay the debts,\" is\r\nintended to state the purposes for which taxes may be levied. But this\r\nlimitation is merely theoretical, for taxes are levied before being\r\nexpended.\r\n\r\n[3] This is to prevent legislation in favor of any state or section, as\r\nagainst other states or sections.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Borrowing._\r\n\r\n_To borrow money on the credit of the United States._\r\n\r\nIt should not be necessary, ordinarily, for congress to exercise this\r\npower. But in times of war the regular sources of income may not be\r\nsufficient, hence the necessity of this power to provide for extraordinary\r\nexpenses. It is one of the prerogatives of sovereignty; it is\r\nindispensable to the existence of a nation.\r\n\r\nFor more about national borrowing, see page 317.\r\n\r\n_Clause 3.--Regulation of Commerce._\r\n\r\n_To regulate commerce[1] with foreign nations, and among the several\r\nstates,[2] and with the Indian tribes.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] The power to regulate commerce implies the power to prescribe rules\r\nfor traffic and navigation, and to do such things as are necessary to\r\nrender them safe. It has been interpreted to cover, among other things,\r\nthe imposition of duties, the designation of ports of entry, the removal\r\nof obstructions in bays and rivers, the establishment and maintenance of\r\nbuoys and lighthouses, and legislation governing pilotage, salvage from\r\nwrecks, maritime insurance, and the privileges of American and foreign\r\nships.\r\n\r\n[2] The power to regulate commerce with foreign nations should go hand in\r\nhand with that of regulating commerce among the states. This power had,\r\nunder the confederation, been in the hands of the several states. Their\r\njealousies and rivalries had led to retaliatory measures upon each other.\r\nThis condition of affairs was encouraged by other nations, because they\r\nprofited by it. At the time of the adoption of the constitution, business\r\nwas terribly depressed, and the bitterness of feeling among the states\r\nwould probably soon have disrupted the Union. Therefore, \"to insure\r\ndomestic tranquility,\" and \"to promote the general welfare,\" the power to\r\nregulate commerce was delegated to the general government.\r\n\r\n[3] This control is exercised even when the Indians live within the\r\nboundaries of a state.\r\n\r\nBy placing the power to regulate commerce with Indians in the hands of the\r\ngeneral government it was hoped that uniformity of regulations and the\r\nstrength of the government would secure peace and safety to the frontier\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n_Clause 4.--Naturalization and Bankruptcy._\r\n\r\n_To establish a uniform rule of naturalization[1] and uniform laws on the\r\nsubject of bankruptcies[2] throughout the United States._\r\n\r\n[1] Naturalization is the process by which an alien becomes a citizen. The\r\nmode is given on page 319.\r\n\r\n[2] A bankrupt is one who has been declared by a court to be owing more\r\nthan he can pay.\r\n\r\nThe purposes of a bankrupt law are:\r\n\r\n1. To secure an equitable distribution of all the debtor's property among\r\nthe creditors.\r\n\r\n2. To secure to the debtor a complete discharge from the indebtedness.\r\n\r\n_Clause 5.--Coinage and Measures._\r\n\r\n_To coin money,[1] regulate the value thereof[2] and of foreign coin,[3]\r\nand fix the standard of weights and measures.[4]_\r\n\r\n[1] This is another \"sovereign power,\" and cannot be exercised by states,\r\ncounties or cities. Coinage by the United States secures uniformity in\r\nvalue, and thereby facilitates business.\r\n\r\nTo \"coin money\" is simply to stamp upon a precious metal the value of the\r\ngiven piece. [Footnote: When metals were first used as money, they were\r\nweighed and their purity was determined by testing. This invited fraud.]\r\nFor convenience in business transactions, these are coined of certain\r\nsizes. To discourage the mutilation of coins for sinister purposes, they\r\nare \"milled\" on the edges, and the stamp covers each face so that the\r\nmetal could hardly be cut off without the coin showing defacement.\r\n\r\n[2] The value is shown by the stamp.\r\n\r\n[3] Otherwise, foreign coin would become an article of commerce, and it\r\nwould be more difficult to regulate the value of domestic coin.\r\n\r\n[4] This power congress has never exercised. But see Johnson's Cyclopedia,\r\narticle Gallon.\r\n\r\n_Clause 6.--Punishment of Counterfeiting._\r\n\r\n_To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and\r\ncurrent coin of the United States._\r\n\r\nThis is \"an indispensable appendage\" of the power granted in the preceding\r\nclause, that of coining money.\r\n\r\nTo discourage counterfeiting, the \"securities\" are engraved with rare\r\nskill and upon peculiar paper. The penalties for counterfeiting are\r\nprinted on the back of some of the \"greenbacks.\"\r\n\r\nUnder \"securities\" are included bonds, coupons, national currency,\r\n\"greenbacks,\" revenue and postage stamps, and all other representatives of\r\nvalue issued under any act of congress.\r\n\r\n_Clause 7.--Postoffices._\r\n\r\n_To establish postoffices[1] and post roads.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] The beneficence and usefulness of the postoffice every one can\r\nappreciate; it ministers to the comfort of all, rich and poor.\r\n\r\nPlacing the management of the postoffices with the general government\r\nsecures greater efficiency and economy than would be possible if it were\r\nvested in the states.\r\n\r\n[2] Congress generally uses roads already in existence. These are\r\nregularly selected, however, and declared to be post roads before they are\r\nused as such. The \"road\" may be a waterway.\r\n\r\nBut under authority of this clause congress has established some post\r\nroads. The principal highway thus established was the Cumberland road from\r\nthe Potomac to the Ohio. The Union Pacific and Central Pacific railways\r\nwere built under the authority and with the assistance of the United\r\nStates as post and military roads.\r\n\r\n_Clause 8.--Copyrights and Patents._\r\n\r\n_To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing, for\r\nlimited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their\r\nrespective writings and discoveries._\r\n\r\nNo one denies that an author or inventor is entitled to a fair reward for\r\nwhat he has done. But if every one were at liberty to print the book or to\r\nmake the article invented, the due reward might not be received.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of granting this power to the general government becomes\r\napparent when we consider how poorly the end might be secured if the\r\nmatter were left to the states. A person might secure a patent in one\r\nstate and be entirely unprotected in the rest.\r\n\r\nFor further information upon this subject, see pages 318-19.\r\n\r\n_Clause 9.--United States Courts._\r\n\r\n_To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court._\r\n\r\nUnder this provision, congress has thus far constituted the following:\r\n\r\n1. United States Circuit Courts of Appeal, one in each of the nine\r\njudicial circuits of the United States.\r\n\r\n2. United States Circuit Courts, holding at least one session annually in\r\neach state.\r\n\r\n3. United States District Courts, from one to three in each state. See\r\npages 307-9.\r\n\r\n4. A United States Court of Claims, to hear claims against the government.\r\nSuch claims were formerly examined by congress.\r\n\r\nAlthough not strictly United States Courts, the following may also be\r\nmentioned here, because they were established under authority of this\r\nclause:\r\n\r\n1. The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n2. A Supreme Court and District Courts in each territory.\r\n\r\n\"Constituting\" these courts involves establishing them, designating the\r\nnumber, appointment, and salaries of the judges, and the powers of each\r\ncourt. The term of United States judges is \"during good behavior.\" This is\r\nfixed by the constitution (Art. III., section 1). The term of a\r\nterritorial judge is four years.\r\n\r\n_Clause 10.--Crimes at Sea._\r\n\r\n_To define and punish piracies[1] and felonies[2] committed on the high\r\nseas[3] and offenses against the law of nations.[4]_\r\n\r\n[1] Piracy is robbery at sea, performed not by an individual but by a\r\nship's crew. Pirates are outlaws, and may be put to death by any nation\r\ncapturing them.\r\n\r\n[2] A felony is any crime punishable by death or state prison. Felony\r\ncovers murder, arson, larceny, burglary, etc. But congress may define\r\npiracy and felony to cover more or fewer crimes.\r\n\r\n[3] The \"high seas\" are the waters of the ocean beyond low water mark. Low\r\nwater mark is the limit of jurisdiction of a state, but the jurisdiction\r\nof the United States extends three miles further into the ocean, and\r\nincludes all bays and gulfs.\r\n\r\nBeyond the three-mile limit, the ocean is \"common ground,\" belonging not\r\nto one nation but to all. Each nation has jurisdiction, however, over its\r\nmerchant ships on the high seas, but not in a foreign port, and over its\r\nwar ships everywhere.\r\n\r\n[4] For an outline of the Law of Nations, see page 346.\r\n\r\nCases arising under this clause have been placed in the jurisdiction of\r\nthe United States District Courts.\r\n\r\n_Clause 11.--Declaration of War._\r\n\r\n_To declare war,[1] grant letters of marque and reprisal[2] and make rules\r\nconcerning captures on land and water.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1]: A declaration of war is a solemn notice to the world that hostilities\r\nactually exist or are about to commence.\r\n\r\nThe power to declare war is one of the attributes of sovereignty. If this\r\npower were in the hands of the several states, any one of them could at\r\nany time involve the whole country in the calamities of war, against the\r\nwishes of all the other states. With all their fear of the general\r\ngovernment, shown in the character of the articles of confederation, the\r\npeople in framing that instrument saw the necessity of vesting this power\r\nin the general government.\r\n\r\nIn monarchies, the power to declare war is generally vested in the\r\nexecutive. But in a republic, it would be dangerous to the interests and\r\neven the liberties of the people, to entrust this power to the president.\r\n\r\nTo put the thought in other words, the power to declare war belongs to the\r\nsovereign: in this country, the people are sovereign, therefore the power\r\nto declare war belongs to the people, and they act through their\r\nrepresentative body, congress. (See pages 351-4.)\r\n\r\n[2] These are commissions granted to private persons usually in time of\r\nwar, authorizing the bearer to pass beyond the boundaries of his own\r\ncountry for the purpose of seizing the property of an enemy.\r\n\r\nSometimes such a letter is granted in times of peace, \"to redress a\r\ngrievance to a private citizen, which the offending nation refuses to\r\nredress.\" By authority of such a commission, the injured individual may\r\nseize property to the value of his injury from the subjects of the nation\r\nso refusing. But this practice is properly becoming rare.\r\n\r\n[3] Vessels acting under letters of marque and reprisal are called\r\n_privateers_, and the captured vessels are called _prizes_.\r\n\r\nPrizes are usually sold under authority of the United States District\r\nCourt, and the proceeds divided among the crew of the ship making the\r\ncapture.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds of captures on land belong to the government.\r\n\r\n_Clause 12.--Maintenance of Armies._\r\n\r\nTo raise and support armies;[1] but no appropriation of money to that use\r\nshall be for a longer term than two years.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] This is another sovereign power, and would seem the necessary\r\naccompaniment of the power to declare war. Under the confederation,\r\nhowever, congress could only designate the quota of men which each state\r\nought to raise, and the actual enlistment of men was done by the several\r\nstates. Their experience in carrying on the Revolutionary War on that\r\nbasis satisfied them that efficiency and economy would both be secured by\r\nvesting this power in the general government.\r\n\r\n[2] But to prevent misuse of the power, this proviso was inserted. As\r\nrepresentatives are elected every two years, the people can promptly check\r\nany attempt to maintain an unnecessarily large army in times of peace.\r\n\r\nA standing army is dangerous to liberty, because it is commanded by the\r\nexecutive, to whom it yields unquestioning obedience. Armies obey\r\n_commands_, while citizens comply with _laws_. And thus a large standing\r\narmy creates a _caste_, out of sympathy with the lives of citizens. More\r\nthan one republic has been overthrown by a successful military leader,\r\nsupported by a devoted army.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, congress makes the appropriation annually.\r\n\r\n_Clause 13.--The Navy._\r\n\r\n_To provide and maintain a navy._\r\n\r\nThe navy is necessary to protect fisheries and commerce. And in times of\r\nwar the navy is needed to protect our sea coast, to transport soldiers, to\r\ncripple the enemy's resources, and to render blockades effectual.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that there is no limitation upon appropriations for the\r\nnavy. This is for two general reasons: First, there is nothing to fear\r\nfrom a navy. \"No nation was ever deprived of its liberty by its navy.\"\r\nSecond, it takes time to provide a navy, and it should therefore be kept\r\nat all times in a state of efficiency.\r\n\r\nFor further information about the army and navy, see page 309.\r\n\r\n_Clause 14.--Army and Navy Regulations._\r\n\r\n_To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval\r\nforces._\r\n\r\nThis is an incident to the preceding powers.\r\n\r\nThe army and navy regulations prescribe duties of officers, soldiers and\r\nseamen, and provide for the organization and management of courts martial.\r\nDisobedience to orders and insubordination are crimes in a soldier or\r\nsailor; and refusal to pay just debts or any other conduct \"unbecoming to\r\na gentleman,\" are punishable offenses in an officer. Thus it is seen that\r\nmilitary law takes cognizance of offenses not usually noticed by civil\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n_Clause 15.--The Militia._\r\n\r\n_To provide for calling forth the militia[1] to execute the laws of the\r\nUnion, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] Congress has declared the militia to be \"all citizens and those who\r\nhave declared their intention to become such, between the ages of eighteen\r\nand forty-five.\" These constitute what is called the unorganized militia.\r\nThe military companies and regiments formed by authority of United States\r\nand state laws constitute the organized militia.\r\n\r\nOne of two policies we must pursue, either to maintain a large standing\r\narmy or to depend upon the citizen-soldiers to meet emergencies. For\r\nseveral reasons, we prefer the latter. That our citizen-soldier may be\r\ndepended upon has been demonstrated on many a battlefield.\r\n\r\n[2] The clause specifies the purposes for which the militia may be called\r\nout. These are three in number. Each state may for similar purposes call\r\nforth its own militia.\r\n\r\nUnder the laws of congress, the president is authorized in certain\r\nemergencies to issue the call. This he directs to the governors of states,\r\nand those called on are bound to furnish the troops required.\r\n\r\nOn three occasions only have the militia been called out under this clause:\r\nIn the Whisky Rebellion of 1794, to enforce the laws; in the war of 1812,\r\nto repel invasion; and in the Civil War, to suppress insurrection.\r\n\r\n_Clause 16.--Organization of the Militia._\r\n\r\n_To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for\r\ngoverning such part of them as may be employed in the service of the\r\nUnited States,[1] reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of\r\nthe officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the\r\ndiscipline prescribed by congress.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] Thus only can the uniformity so essential to efficiency be secured.\r\n\r\n[2] This is designed as a proper recognition of the right of each state to\r\nhave militia companies and to control them, subject only to the necessary\r\nlimitation mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe militia of a state consists of one or more regiments, with the proper\r\nregimental and company officers appointed by state authority. When these\r\nare mustered into the service of the United States and are formed into\r\nbrigades and divisions, the appointment of the general officers is vested\r\nin the president.\r\n\r\n_Clause 17.--Exclusive Legislation._\r\n\r\n_To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such\r\ndistrict (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by the cession of\r\nparticular states, and the acceptance of congress, become the seat of\r\ngovernment of the United States,[1] and to exercise like authority over\r\nall places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in\r\nwhich the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,\r\ndock yards, and other needful buildings.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] This refers to the territory afterwards selected, and now known as the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this provision is to free the general government from\r\nhaving to depend upon the protection of any state, and to enable it to\r\nsecure the public buildings and archives from injury and itself from\r\ninsult. [Footnote: The Continental Congress, while the capital was at\r\nPhiladelphia, had to adjourn to Princeton to escape the violence of some\r\ndissatisfied soldiers. See Fiske's Critical Period of American History,\r\npage 112.]\r\n\r\nCongress governed the District of Columbia directly until 1871, when for\r\nthree years the experiment was tried of governing it as a territory. The\r\nterritorial government in that time ran in debt over $20,000,000 for\r\n\"public improvements,\" and congress abolished it.\r\n\r\nThe supervision of the district is now in the hands of three\r\ncommissioners, appointed by the president, but controlled by congressional\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n[2] The propriety of the general government having exclusive authority\r\nover such places is too obvious to need comment. Crimes committed there\r\nare tried in the United States District Courts, but according to the laws\r\nof the state or territory.\r\n\r\nThe state in making the cession usually reserves the right to serve civil\r\nand criminal writs upon persons found within the ceded territory, in order\r\nthat such places may not become asylums for fugitives from justice.\r\n\r\n_Clause 18.--Implied Powers._\r\n\r\n_To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into\r\nexecution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this\r\nconstitution in the government of the United States, or in any department\r\nor officer thereof._\r\n\r\nThis clause does not grant any new power. \"It is merely a declaration, to\r\nremove all uncertainty, that every power is to be so interpreted, as to\r\ninclude suitable means to carry it into execution.\" [Footnote: Story.]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the powers of congress are enumerated, not\r\ndefined, in the constitution; and the above clause has given rise to the\r\ndoctrine of \"implied powers,\" the basis of many political controversies.\r\n\r\nFollowing are samples of \"implied powers:\"\r\n\r\nBy clause 2, congress has power \"to borrow money on the credit of the\r\nUnited States.\" Implied in this, is the power to issue securities or\r\nevidences of debt, such as treasury notes. \"To increase the credit of the\r\nUnited States, congress may make such evidences of debt a legal tender for\r\ndebts, public and private.\" [Footnote: Lalor's Cylopedia of Political\r\nScience.]\r\n\r\nCongress has power (clause 11) \"to declare war.\" By implication it has\r\npower to prosecute the war \"by all the legitimate methods known to\r\ninternational law.\" To that end, it may confiscate the property of public\r\nenemies, foreign or domestic; it may confiscate, therefore, their slaves.\r\n(See Emancipation Proclamation, page 362.

(For\r\nfurther discussion of slavery, see page 343.)\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--The Writ of Habeas Corpus._\r\n\r\n_The privileges of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended,\r\nunless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may\r\nrequire it._\r\n\r\n\"It has been judicially decided that the right to suspend the privilege of\r\nthe writ rests in congress, but that congress may by act give the power to\r\nthe president.\" [Footnote: Lalor's Cyclopedia of Political Economy]\r\n\r\nThe privilege of the writ never was suspended by the general government\r\nuntil 1861. Questionable suspensions of the writ, covering a very limited\r\nterritory, had been made in two or three instances by generals.\r\n\r\nSo valuable as a \"bulwark of liberty\" is this writ considered to be, that\r\nthe courts of the United States have decided that, even in time of war,\r\nthe privilege of the writ can be suspended only in that part of the\r\ncountry actually invaded, or in such a state of war as to obstruct the\r\naction of the federal courts.\r\n\r\n_Clause 3.--Certain Laws Forbidden._\r\n\r\n_No bill of attainder[1] or ex post facto law[2] shall be passed._\r\n\r\n[1] A bill of attainder was a legislative conviction for alleged crime,\r\nwith judgment of death. Those legislative convictions which imposed\r\npunishments less than that of death were called bills of pains and\r\npenalties. [Footnote: Cooley's Constitutional Limitations] The term is\r\nhere used in its generic sense, so as to include bills of pains and\r\npenalties.\r\n\r\nThe great objection to _bills_ of attainder is that they are purely\r\n_judicial_ acts performed by a _legislative_ body. A legislative body may\r\nand should try a _political_ offense, and render a verdict as to the\r\nworthiness of the accused to hold public office. But to try him when\r\nconviction would deprive him of any of his personal rights--life, liberty,\r\nor property,--should be the work of a duly organized _judicial_ body.\r\n\r\nThis provision, then is directed not so much against the penalty (for\r\nlimitations upon penalties are found elsewhere in the constitution,) as\r\nagainst the mode of trial. Or we may say that it is intended to prevent\r\nconviction _without_ a trial; for in previous times legislative bodies had\r\nfrequently punished political enemies without even the form of a trial, or\r\nwithout giving them an opportunity to be heard in their own defense, by\r\npassing against them bills of attainder.\r\n\r\n[2] An _ex post facto_ law is, literally, one which acts back upon a deed\r\npreviously performed. But as here intended, it means a law making _worse_\r\nsuch an act, either by declaring criminal that which was not so regarded\r\nin law when committed, or by increasing the penalty and applying it to the\r\nact previously performed.\r\n\r\nBut a law may be passed making _better_, in a sense, some previous act.\r\nThat is, an unforseen but imperative necessity may call for the doing of\r\nsomething which is not unlawful, but which needs, yet has not received,\r\nthe sanction of law. This act may _afterwards_ be _legalized_ by the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nThe things forbidden by this clause would, if permitted, render unsafe all\r\nthose personal rights for the security of which the constitution was\r\nframed and the government founded.\r\n\r\n_Clause 4.--Direct Taxes_\r\n\r\n_No capitation or other direct tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to\r\nthe census or enumeration hereinbefore directed to be taken._\r\n\r\nThis clause emphasizes the first sentence of clause three, section two, of\r\nthis article. It was _intended_ to prevent the taxation of the _two-fifths\r\nof the slaves_ not enumerated for representation, and was evidently\r\ninserted as a concession to the slave states. But the abolition of slavery\r\ntakes from the clause all force except that mentioned at the beginning of\r\nthis paragraph.\r\n\r\nNo capitation tax (that is, so much _per head_) has ever been levied by\r\nthe general government.\r\n\r\n_Clause 5.--Duties on Exports._\r\n\r\n_No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any state._\r\n\r\nThis was designed to prevent discrimination against any state or section.\r\n\r\nThough the question has never been judicially determined, it is generally\r\nunderstood that since anything exported must be exported from some state\r\n(or territory), this clause prohibits _all_ export duties.\r\n\r\n_Clause 6.--Commercial Restrictions._\r\n\r\n_No preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to\r\nthe ports of one state over those of another; nor shall vessels bound to\r\nor from one state, be obliged to enter, clear or pay duties in another._\r\n\r\nThis provision has the same object in view as that which requires duties\r\nto be uniform--the impartial treatment of the several states. It shows,\r\ntoo, the fear felt by many that the general government _might_ show\r\npartiality.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the clause virtually establishes free trade among the\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n_Clause 7.--Care of Public Funds._\r\n\r\n_No money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of\r\nappropriations made by law; and a regular statement and account of the\r\nreceipts and expenditures of all public money shall he published from time\r\nto time._\r\n\r\nThere are two great purposes to be subserved by this provision: First, to\r\nimpose upon those handling the money a feeling of responsibility, and thus\r\nto increase the probability of carefulness; second, to prevent the use of\r\npublic funds for any purpose except those authorized by the\r\nrepresentatives of the people. This is in harmony with the provision which\r\ngives to congress the power to raise money.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, too, this is a protector of our liberties. Those who have\r\ncharge of the public purse are appointees of the president. But for this\r\nprovision he might, as rulers in arbitrary governments do, use the public\r\ntreasury to accomplish his own private purposes; and one of these purposes\r\nmight be the overthrow of our liberties. This thought undoubtedly was a\r\nprominent one in the minds of the framers of the constitution.\r\n\r\nThe account of receipts and expenditures is reported to congress annually\r\nby the secretary of the treasury.\r\n\r\n_Clause 8.--Titles of Nobility._\r\n\r\nNo title of nobility shall be granted by the United States;[1] and no\r\nperson holding an office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the\r\nconsent of the congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or\r\ntitle of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state[2]_.\r\n\r\n[1] This is in harmony with the principle \"All men are created equal.\"\r\nAnd, while in society there are classes and grades based upon learning,\r\nwealth, etc., we intend that all shall be equal before the law, that there\r\nshall be no \"privileged classes.\"\r\n\r\n[2] The purpose of this is evident--to free public officers from\r\nblandishments, which are many times the precursors of temptations to\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to the constitution was proposed in 1811, prohibiting any\r\ncitizen from receiving any kind of office or present from a foreign power,\r\nbut it was not ratified.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION X.--PROHIBITIONS ON THE STATES.\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Unconditional Prohibitions._\r\n\r\n_No state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;[1]\r\ngrant letters of marque and reprisal;[2] coin money;[3] emit bills of\r\ncredit;[4] make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of\r\ndebts;[5] pass any bill of attainder,[6] ex post facto law,[6] or law\r\nimpairing the obligation of contracts,[7] or grant any title of\r\nnobility.[6]_\r\n\r\n[1] Otherwise the intrigues of foreign nations would soon break up the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\n[2] Had the states this power, it would be possible for any one of them to\r\ninvolve the whole country in war.\r\n\r\n[3] This provision secures the uniformity and reliability of our coinage.\r\n\r\n[4] A state may borrow money and may issue bonds for the purpose. But\r\nthese bonds are not bills of credit, because they are not designed to\r\ncirculate as money.\r\n\r\nThe evils of state issuance of bills of credit we cannot appreciate, but\r\nthe framers of the constitution had experienced them, and based this\r\nprovision on that bitter experience.\r\n\r\n[5] This has the same general purpose as the preceding.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that there is no such prohibition on the United\r\nStates, and the implied power to emit bills of credit and to make things\r\nother than gold and silver legal tender, has been exercised.\r\n\r\n[6] Forbidden to the states for the same reason that they are forbidden to\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n[7] The purpose is to preserve the legal obligation of contracts. \"The\r\nspirit of the provision is this: A contract which is legally binding upon\r\nthe parties at the time and place it is entered into by them, shall remain\r\nso, any law of the states to the contrary notwithstanding.\" [Footnote:\r\nTiffany quoted by Andrews.]\r\n\r\nUnder this provision many questions have arisen. One of them is this: May\r\na state pass insolvent or bankrupt laws? It has been decided by the United\r\nStates Supreme Court that a state may pass insolvent laws upon _future_\r\ncontracts, but not upon _past_ contracts. But no state can pass a bankrupt\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Conditional Prohibitions._\r\n\r\nNo state shall, without the consent of the congress,[1] lay any imposts or\r\nduties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for\r\nexecuting its inspection laws;[2] and the net produce of all duties and\r\nimposts, laid by any state on imports or exports, shall be for the use of\r\nthe treasury of the United States;[3] and all such laws shall be subject\r\nto the revision of the congress.[4] No state shall, without the consent of\r\ncongress, lay any duty of tonnage,[5] keep troops or ships of war in time\r\nof peace,[6] enter into any agreement or compact with another state,[7] or\r\nwith a foreign power,[7] or engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in\r\nsuch imminent danger as not to admit of delay.[8]_\r\n\r\n[1] By implication, congress may give the states permission to do the\r\nthings enumerated in this paragraph. But it never has.\r\n\r\n[2] The inspection laws are designed to secure to consumers quality and\r\nquantity in commodities purchased. Thus, in some states there is a dairy\r\ncommissioner whose duty it is to see that no substance is offered for sale\r\nas butter which is not butter. And officers may be appointed to inspect\r\nthe weights and measures in stores. Such officers may be provided for\r\nwithout the consent of congress. But no fees can be charged for this\r\nservice more than are necessary to pay the officers. In other words, the\r\noffices cannot be made a source of revenue to the state.\r\n\r\n[3] This is to free the states from any temptation to use the power which\r\nmight be conferred under this clause for their own gain, to the detriment\r\nof a sister state.\r\n\r\n[4] This secures to congress the control of the matter.\r\n\r\n[5] That is, a tax upon the carrying power of a ship. This is in harmony\r\nwith the provision which forbids the states to levy duties on imports.\r\n\r\n[6] This prohibits the keeping of a standing army, but each state may have\r\nits organized militia.\r\n\r\n[7] In the preceding clause, the states are forbidden to enter into\r\ntreaties, etc.,--that is, into _political_ compacts; and the prohibition\r\nis absolute. Here they are prohibited from entering into _business_\r\ncompacts, unless permitted by congress.\r\n\r\n[8] For a state to engage in war would be to embroil the country in war.\r\nBut the militia might be sent to repel invasion. They would, however, be\r\ndefending not the state simply, but also the United States.\r\n\r\n\"We have thus passed through the positive prohibitions introduced upon the\r\npowers of the states. It will be observed that they divide themselves into\r\ntwo classes: those which are political in their character, as an exercise\r\nof sovereignty, and those which more especially regard the private rights\r\nof individuals. In the latter the prohibition is absolute and universal.\r\nIn the former it is sometimes absolute and sometimes subjected to the\r\nconsent of congress. It will at once be perceived how full of difficulty\r\nand delicacy the task was, to reconcile the jealous tenacity of the states\r\nover their own sovereignty, with the permanent security of the national\r\ngovernment, and the inviolability of private rights. The task has been\r\naccomplished with eminent success.\" [Footnote: Story.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWhen was slavery introduced into the United States?

But it will be remembered that under the confederation\r\nthere was no executive department. The colonists had suffered from kingly\r\nrule, and in forming their first government after independence, they\r\nnaturally avoided anything having the appearance of kingliness. After\r\ntrying their experiment for some years, however, their \"sober second\r\nsense\" told them that the executive branch is a necessity, and when the\r\nconvention assembled to \"revise the articles of confederation\" (as they at\r\nfirst intended to do) one of the things upon which there was practical\r\nunanimity of opinion was the necessity of having the government organized\r\ninto three branches, or, as they are sometimes called, departments.\r\n\r\nThe question in regard to the executive branch was how to organize it, so\r\nas to secure two chief qualities; namely, energy of execution and safety\r\nto the people. The former was fully appreciated, for the weakness of\r\nexecution during the confederation period, or the lack of execution, had\r\nimpressed upon all thinking persons the necessity of more vigor in\r\ncarrying out the laws. The experience during colonial days emphasized the\r\nnecessity of surrounding the office with proper safeguards. And among\r\nthose intrusted with the organization of a scheme of government, were many\r\nwho were well versed in history--men who knew that the executive branch is\r\nthe one in which lies the menace to human liberty. Under these two main\r\ndivisions of the problem, arose such questions as: How many persons shall\r\nconstitute the executive? What shall the term be? How shall the executive\r\nbe chosen? What powers, other than those which are purely executive, shall\r\nbe vested in this branch? How shall this branch be held responsible,\r\nwithout crippling its efficiency?\r\n\r\nHow well the problem was solved, we shall find out in our study of the\r\nprovisions of the constitution pertaining to this branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--ELECTION AND SERVICE.\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Vestment of Power._\r\n\r\n_The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States\r\nof America.[1] He shall hold his office during the term of four years,[2]\r\nand together with the vice-president,[3] chosen for the same term, shall\r\nbe elected as follows:_\r\n\r\n[1] This sentence answers the question, \"How many persons shall constitute\r\nthe executive?\" and gives the official title thereof.\r\n\r\nThe executive authority is vested in one person for two chief reasons: To\r\nsecure energy in execution, and to impose upon the executive a sense of\r\nresponsibility. If the executive power were vested in a number of persons,\r\nthe differences and jealousies sure to arise, and the absence of\r\nresponsibility, would result in a feeble administration, which is but\r\nanother name for a bad administration.\r\n\r\n[2] The term first reported by the committee of the whole was seven years,\r\nwith the provision forbidding re-election. Some of the delegates were in\r\nfavor of annual elections, while others thought that the executive should\r\nbe elected for life or good behavior. And other terms, varying from two to\r\nten years, had their advocates. After much discussion, the term of four\r\nyears was agreed upon as a compromise, and no limitation was put upon the\r\nnumber of terms for which a person might be elected.\r\n\r\nIn another place it is made the duty of the president to recommended to\r\ncongress such measures as he deems necessary for the good of the country.\r\nHe should, therefore, have a term long enough to fairly test his \"policy\"\r\nand to stimulate him to personal firmness in the execution of his duties,\r\nyet not so long as to free him from a sense of responsibility. It was\r\nthought that a term of four years would cover both of the conditions\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[3] The purpose of having a vice-president is to provide a successor for\r\nthe president in case of his disability or death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOOSING THE PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Number and Appointment of Electors._\r\n\r\n_Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may\r\ndirect, a number of electors equal to the whole number of senators and\r\nrepresentatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress; but no\r\nsenator or representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit\r\nunder the United States, shall be appointed an elector._\r\n\r\nThree plans for the election of president and vice-president were proposed:\r\nFirst, election by congress; second, election by the people; third,\r\nelection by persons chosen by the people for that special purpose.\r\n\r\nThe objection to the first plan was, that it would rob the executive\r\nbranch of that independence which in our plan of government it is designed\r\nto possess--it would render the executive branch in a measure subordinate\r\nto the legislative.\r\n\r\nThe objections to the second plan came from two sources. Some of the\r\ndelegates feared that, inexperienced as they were, the people could not be\r\ntrusted to act wisely in the choice of a president--that they would be\r\nswayed by partizan feeling, instead of acting with cool deliberation. And\r\nthe small states feared that in a popular election their power would count\r\nfor little.\r\n\r\nThen the compromise in the organization of the congress was remembered,\r\nand it was resolved that the election of the president and vice-president\r\nshould be placed in the hands of persons chosen for that special purpose,\r\nand that the number of the electors from each state should be that of its\r\nrepresentation in congress. This satisfied both parties. Those who thought\r\nthat the people could not be intrusted with so important a matter as the\r\nchoice of the president, hoped that this mode would place the election in\r\nthe hands of the wise men of the several states. And the delegates from\r\nthe small states secured in this all the concession which they could\r\nfairly ask.\r\n\r\nThis matter being settled, the next question was: How shall the electors\r\nbe chosen? There being much difference of opinion on the subject, it was\r\nthought best to let each state choose its electors in the way which it\r\nmight prefer.\r\n\r\nNaturally the modes of choosing electors varied. In some states the\r\nlegislature chose them, but this mode soon became unpopular. [Footnote:\r\nSouth Carolina, however, retained this mode until very recently.] In some\r\nstates they were chosen by the people on a general ticket, and in others,\r\nby the people by congressional districts. The last is the fairest way,\r\nbecause it most nearly represents the wishes of the people. By electing on\r\na general ticket, the party which is in the majority in any state can\r\nelect _all_ of the electors. But, for this very reason, the majority in\r\neach state has finally arranged the matter so that this is now the\r\npractice in nearly all the states.\r\n\r\nThe present system of nominations and pledged electors was undreamed of by\r\nthe framers of the constitution. They intended that in the selection of\r\nthe president each elector should be free to vote according to his own\r\nbest judgment. But it has come to pass that the electors simply register a\r\nverdict already rendered. Briefly the history of the change is this:\r\nDuring the administration of Washington (who had been elected unanimously)\r\ndifferences of opinion on questions of policy gave rise to political\r\nparties. To secure the unity of action so essential to success, the\r\nleaders of the respective parties, by agreement among themselves,\r\ndesignated, as each election approached, persons whom they recommended for\r\nsupport by electors of their party. Gradually the recommendation came to\r\nbe looked upon as binding. In 1828 the Anti-Masonic party, having no\r\nmembers of congress to act as leaders, held a \"people's convention.\" Its\r\nnominees received a surprisingly large vote. The popularity of this mode\r\nof nomination thus appearing, the other parties gradually adopted it, and\r\nsince 1840 it has remained a recognized part of our political machinery.\r\n\r\n_Clause 3.--Election of President and Vice-President._\r\n\r\n_The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot\r\nfor two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the\r\nsame state with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons\r\nvoted for, and the number of votes for each; which list they shall sign\r\nand certify, and transmit, sealed, to the seat of the government of the\r\nUnited States, directed to the president of the senate. The president of\r\nthe senate shall, in the presence of the senate and house of\r\nrepresentatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be\r\ncounted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be\r\npresident, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors\r\nappointed; and if there be more than one who have such a majority, and\r\nhave an equal number of votes, then the house of representatives shall\r\nimmediately choose by ballot one of them president, and if no person have\r\na majority, then from the five highest on the list the said house shall in\r\nlike manner choose the president. But in choosing the president, the vote\r\nshall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one\r\nvote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from\r\ntwo-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be\r\nnecessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the president,\r\nthe person having the greatest number of votes of the electors, shall be\r\nvice-president. But if there should remain two or more who have equal\r\nvotes, the senate shall choose from them by ballot the vice-president._\r\n\r\nUnder this provision Washington was elected president twice and Adams\r\nonce. In the disputed election of 1800, it was found that this mode would\r\nnot do. The faulty feature in the plan is found in the first sentence,\r\nwhich requires the electors to vote for two persons for president. In this\r\nelection, Jefferson and Burr, candidates of the same party, received the\r\nsame number of votes and each had a majority. The power to choose then\r\ndevolved upon the house of representatives. There were at that time\r\nsixteen states, and consequently sixteen votes. Of these Jefferson\r\nreceived eight, Burr six, and the remaining two were \"scattering.\" As it\r\nrequired nine votes to make a majority, no one was elected. The balloting\r\nwas continued for seven days, thirty-six ballots being taken. On the\r\nthirty-sixth ballot Jefferson received ten votes to four for Burr.\r\nJefferson thus became president and Burr vice-president. But the\r\nconsequent bitterness of feeling was much regretted, and it was determined\r\nto change, slightly, the mode of election. The changes consisted in having\r\nthe electors vote for one person for president and for a different person\r\nfor vice-president; and when the election is thrown into the house of\r\nrepresentatives, the selection is to be made from the _three_ highest\r\ninstead of the _five_ highest as originally. The change was made by the\r\ntwelfth amendment, passed in 1804, which is here given in full.\r\n\r\n_The Twelfth Amendment._\r\n\r\n_The electors shall meet in their respective states and vote by ballot for\r\npresident and vice-president, one of whom, at least, shall not be an\r\ninhabitant of the same state with themselves; they shall name in their\r\nballots the person voted for as president, and in distinct ballots the\r\nperson voted for as vice-president, and they shall make distinct lists of\r\nall persons voted for as president, and of all persons voted for as\r\nvice-president, and of the number of votes for each; which lists they\r\nshall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of government of\r\nthe United States, directed to the president of the senate. The president\r\nof the senate shall, in the presence of the senate and house of\r\nrepresentatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be\r\ncounted; the person having the greatest number of votes for president\r\nshall be president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of\r\nelectors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the\r\npersons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of\r\nthose voted for as president, the house of representatives shall choose\r\nimmediately by ballot, the president. But in choosing the president, the\r\nvotes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having\r\none vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members\r\nfrom two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be\r\nnecessary to a choice. And if the house of representatives shall not\r\nchoose a president whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them,\r\nbefore the fourth day of March, next following, then the vice-president\r\nshall act as president, as in the case of the death or other\r\nconstitutional disability of the president._\r\n\r\n_The person having the greatest number of votes as vice-president, shall\r\nbe the vice-president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of\r\nelectors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two\r\nhighest numbers on the list the senate shall choose the vice-president; a\r\nquorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of\r\nsenators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a\r\nchoice. But no person constitutionally ineligible to office of president\r\nshall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States._\r\n\r\nThus we see that the president may be elected in one of two ways--by\r\nelectors or by the house of representatives; and that the vice-president\r\nmay also be elected in one of two ways--by electors or by the senate.\r\n\r\nThe mode of choosing the president is regarded by many as difficult to\r\nremember. Perhaps making an outline like the following will aid the memory:\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Mode or Process._\r\n\r\nI. The electors, after they are chosen:\r\n   1. MEET in their respective states.\r\n   2. VOTE by ballot, for president and vice-president.\r\n   3. MAKE LISTS of the persons voted for and the number\r\n          of votes for each.\r\n   4. SIGN, CERTIFY and SEAL those lists.\r\n   5. TRANSMIT them to the seat of government, addressed\r\n          to the president of the senate.\r\n\r\nII. The president of the senate:\r\n   1. OPENS the certificates, in presence of both houses.\r\n   2. DECLARES THE RESULT, after the votes have been\r\n          counted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Second Mode or Process._\r\n\r\nPoints--            President--                Vice-President--\r\nChosen by.......... House of Representatives   The Senate.\r\nFrom............... Three highest.             Two highest.\r\nVoting............. By ballot.                 By ballot.\r\nState power........ Each one vote.             Each two votes.\r\nQuorum............. Representatives from       Two-thirds of senators.\r\n                      two-thirds of the states.\r\nNecessary to choice Majority of states.         Majority of senators\r\n\r\nThe place of meeting is usually the capital of the state.\r\n\r\nThree \"lists\" of the vote for president and three for vice-president are\r\nprepared, and \"signed, certified and sealed.\" One pair of these lists is\r\nsent by mail and another by special messenger. The third is deposited with\r\nthe judge of the United States District Court in whose district the\r\nelectors meet, to be called for if necessary. The purpose of these\r\nprecautions is to make sure that the vote of the state may not be lost,\r\nbut shall without fail reach the president of the senate.\r\n\r\n_Clause 4.--Times of These Elections._\r\n\r\n_The congress may determine the time of choosing the electors,[1] and the\r\nday on which they shall give their votes;[2] which day shall be the same\r\nthroughout the United States.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] The day designated by congress is the first Tuesday after the first\r\nMonday in November. The election always comes in \"leap year.\"\r\n\r\n[2] The electors meet and vote on the second Monday in January.\r\n\r\n[3] This provision was designed, first, to prevent fraud in voting; and\r\nsecond to leave each state free to act as it thought best in the matter of\r\npersons for the offices, unbiased by the probability of success or failure\r\nwhich would be shown if the elections occurred on different days in\r\ndifferent states.\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to know in this connection that:\r\n\r\nThe president of the senate sends for missing votes, if there be any, on\r\nthe fourth Monday in January.\r\n\r\nThe counting of votes is begun on the second Wednesday in February and\r\ncontinued until the count is finished. (See page 334.)\r\n\r\nIn case the electors have not given any one a majority for the presidency,\r\nthe house proceeds at once to elect. In a similar case the senate proceeds\r\nat once to choose a vice-president.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the continental congress for the first election were:\r\n\r\n1. Electors to be chosen, first Wednesday in January, 1789.\r\n\r\n2. Electors to vote, first Wednesday in February.\r\n\r\n3. The presidential term to commence first Wednesday in March. The first\r\nWednesday in March in 1789 was the fourth day of the month, and on that\r\nday the presidential terms have continued to begin.\r\n\r\n_Clause 5.--Qualifications of President and Vice-President.\r\n\r\nNo person except a natural born citizen,[1] or a citizen of the United\r\nStates at the time of the adoption of this constitution,[2] shall be\r\neligible to the office of president; neither shall any person be eligible\r\nto that office, who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five\r\nyears,[3] and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.[4]_\r\n\r\n[1] The importance of the office is such as, in the opinion of the framers\r\nof the constitution, to necessitate this requirement. And it does not seem\r\nunjust to make this limitation.\r\n\r\n[2] This exception was made from a sense of gratitude to many\r\ndistinguished persons, who, though not native citizens, had placed their\r\nlives and fortunes at the service of this country during the revolution,\r\nand who had already become citizens of the young republic. This provision\r\nis now, of course, obsolete.\r\n\r\n[3] Age should bring wisdom. The age specified is great enough to permit\r\nthe passions of youth to become moderated and the judgment matured. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the youngest president yet elected was much older than\r\nthis minimum. In monarchies the rulers are sometimes children. It cannot\r\nbe so with us.\r\n\r\n[4] But a \"natural born citizen,\" even, may live so long in a foreign\r\ncountry as to lose his interest in his native land. This provision is\r\nintended to preclude the election of such persons to the presidency. They\r\nmight seek it at the instance of a foreign government, for sinister\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nWill residence during _any_ fourteen years satisfy the requirement?\r\nCommentators generally have expressed an affirmative opinion, based upon\r\nthe fact that James Buchanan and others were elected president on their\r\nreturn from diplomatic service abroad. It must be remembered, however,\r\nthat a person sent abroad to represent this government _does not lose his\r\nresidence in this country_. Therefore the fact of Mr. Buchanan being\r\nelected after acting as our minister to England, has no bearing upon the\r\nquestion. On the other hand, the evident purpose of the provision could\r\nhardly be satisfied if a boy, a native of this country, should live here\r\nuntil fourteen years of age and then spend the rest of his years in a\r\nforeign country. And when the matter is carefully considered, it will be\r\nseen that the only fourteen years which will secure that state of mind in\r\nthe candidate which is sought by the provision, are the fourteen years\r\n_immediately preceding election_. Again, twenty-one and fourteen equal\r\nthirty-five. A person \"comes of age\" at twenty-one. The fourteen years of\r\n_manhood_ added would just make thirty-five years, the minimum age\r\nrequired. This coincidence could hardly have been accidental, and\r\njustifies the view expressed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the twelfth amendment, the qualifications of the\r\nvice-president are the same as those of the president.\r\n\r\n_Clause 6.--Vacancies._\r\n\r\n_In case of the removal of the president from office, or of his death,\r\nresignation or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said\r\noffice, the same shall devolve on the vice-president, and the congress may\r\nby law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability,\r\nboth of the president and vice-president, declaring what officer shall\r\nthen act as president, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the\r\ndisability be removed, or a president shall be elected._\r\n\r\nIf no regular succession were established, there would be danger of\r\nanarchy.\r\n\r\nBy an act passed March 1, 1792, congress provided that in case of the\r\ndisability of both president and vice-president, the duties of the office\r\nof president should devolve upon the president _pro tempore_ of the senate;\r\nand in case of a vacancy in that office, that they should then devolve\r\nupon the speaker of the house of representatives.\r\n\r\nBut when president Garfield died there was no president _pro tempore_ of\r\nthe senate and no speaker of the house; so that when vice-president Arthur\r\nbecame president, there was no one to succeed him in case of his\r\ndisability. It was then expected that congress would devise another plan\r\nof succession; but it did not. When vice-president Hendricks died, there\r\nwas again no president _pro tempore_ of the senate or speaker of the\r\nhouse. This recurrence of the danger within four years prompted congress\r\nto provide an order of succession less liable to accident than the one so\r\nlong in use. The succession was placed in the cabinet in the following\r\norder: Secretary of state, secretary of the treasury, secretary of war,\r\nattorney-general, postmaster-general, secretary of the navy, and secretary\r\nof the interior.\r\n\r\nWhen the vice-president or secretary becomes president, he serves for the\r\nremainder of the term.\r\n\r\nOne very important item in this connection the constitution leaves\r\nunprovided for, namely, who shall determine when \"disability,\" other than\r\ndeath, occurs or ceases? Certainly the decision should not be left to\r\nthose interested in the succession. No official answer to this question\r\nhas yet been given.\r\n\r\n_Clause 7.--President's Salary._\r\n\r\n_The president shall, at stated times, receive for his services a\r\ncompensation[1] which shall be neither increased nor diminished during the\r\nperiod for which he shall have been elected,[2] and he shall not receive\r\nwithin that period any other emolument from the United States or any of\r\nthem.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] Otherwise a person of moderate means would be debarred from accepting\r\nthe position, and the country might thereby be deprived of the services of\r\nsome man of lofty character.\r\n\r\n[2] Thus congress can neither bribe nor drive the president into doing\r\nanything which he may regard as unwise or wrong. And on the other hand,\r\nthe president has no temptation to try to \"undermine the virtue\" of\r\ncongress for his own pecuniary benefit.\r\n\r\n[3] This provision has the same purpose in view as the last. \"He is thus\r\nsecured, in a great measure, against all sinister foreign influences. And\r\nhe must be lost to all just sense of high duties of his station, if he\r\ndoes not conduct himself with an exclusive devotion to the good of the\r\nwhole people, unmindful at once of the blandishments of courtiers, who\r\nseek to deceive him, and of partizans, who aim to govern him, and thus\r\naccomplish their own selfish purposes.\" [Footnote: Story]\r\n\r\nTill 1873 the salary of the president was $25,000 a year. It was then\r\nraised to $50,000 a year. He also has the use of the White House, which is\r\nfurnished at national expense; and special appropriations are frequently\r\nmade to cover special expenses. And yet few presidents have been able to\r\nsave anything out of their salaries.\r\n\r\nThe vice-president receives $8000 a year.\r\n\r\n_Clause 8.--Oath of Office._\r\n\r\n_Before he enter upon the execution of his office, he shall take the\r\nfollowing oath or affirmation: \"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I\r\nwill faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and\r\nwill to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the\r\nconstitution of the United States.\"_\r\n\r\nThis oath is usually administered by the chief justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt. It is very simple, pledging the president to two things only; but\r\nthey are the essential things.\r\n\r\n\"Taking the oath\" is a part of the inauguration ceremonies which occur,\r\nusually, on the fourth of March.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWas there any president under the confederation? Why? When does the\r\npresident's term begin? Suppose that day comes on Sunday? How does a\r\npresidential term compare with that of senator? Of representative? The\r\nfirst proposition in the constitutional convention was to make the\r\npresidential term seven years, and limit a person to one term. Is the\r\npresent plan better or not as good? For how many terms may a person be\r\nelected president? What presidents have been elected for a second term?\r\n\r\nHow many presidential electors is this state entitled to? New York?\r\nIllinois? Wisconsin? Delaware? How many are there altogether? Show how the\r\npresent mode is an advantage to the small states. Who were the electors of\r\nthis state in the last presidential election? Get a \"ticket\" or ballot and\r\nstudy it. Tear off, beginning at the top, all that you can without\r\naffecting the vote. How could a person have voted for one of the\r\nrepublican candidates without voting for the other? Where did the electors\r\nof this state meet? When? Did you preserve the newspaper report of their\r\nproceedings?\r\n\r\nCould the president and vice-president be chosen from the same state? How\r\nmany electoral votes were necessary to a choice last time? How many did\r\neach candidate receive? In case of election by the house of\r\nrepresentatives, what is the smallest possible number that could elect? In\r\ncase the house should fail to choose a president before the fourth of\r\nMarch, who would be president? Have we ever been threatened with a case of\r\nthis kind? Which presidents have been elected by the house? Has a\r\nvice-president ever been chosen by the senate?\r\n\r\nSpecify four differences between the old and the new way of electing\r\npresident and vice-president. Which was the most important change? What\r\nstatement in the twelfth amendment was unnecessary in the original\r\nprovision? If \"two-thirds of the senators\" are present, are two-thirds of\r\nthe states necessarily represented? What is the smallest number of\r\nsenators that could elect a vice-president? How many times has the\r\nvice-president succeeded to the presidency? What caused the vacancies? Is\r\nthe result of the election known before the meeting of the electors?\r\n\r\nWho is our present minister to England? Would a son of his born in England\r\ntoday be eligible in due time to the presidency? Make a comparative table,\r\ngiving the qualifications, mode of election (general), and term of\r\nrepresentatives, senators and president.\r\n\r\nWho is now vice-president of the United States? Have we ever had more than\r\none vice-president at the same time? Name the persons, in their order, who\r\nwould succeed to the presidency if the president should be unable to\r\nperform his duties. If the president should become insane, who would\r\ndecide that such is the fact? How long would the person thus succeeding to\r\nthe position of acting president serve? State four ways in which a vacancy\r\nin the office of president may occur. If the president leaves Washington,\r\nis a vacancy created? If he leaves the country? If he is impeached? In\r\ncase of the non-election of either president or vice-president, who would\r\nserve? How long? How is a vacancy in the office of vice-president filled?\r\n\r\nAt what \"stated times\" is the salary of the president paid? In November,\r\n1872, President Grant was re-elected. His new term began March, 1873. In\r\nthe meantime the salary of the president was increased to $50,000. Did\r\nPresident Grant get the increase? Explain.\r\n\r\nDoes the vice-president take an \"oath of office?\" If he succeeds to the\r\npresidency must he take the oath prescribed in the constitution? What\r\nconstitutional provision for the salary of the vice president? Compare the\r\nduties of a governor of a state with those of the president.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Debate._\r\n\r\nResolved, That the president should be elected by a direct vote of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nResolved, That the presidential term should be lengthened, and a second\r\nterm forbidden.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Some Sole Powers._\r\n\r\n_The president shall be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the\r\nUnited States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into\r\nthe actual service of the United States;[1] he may require the opinion, in\r\nwriting, of the principal officer in each of the executive departments,\r\nupon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices,[2]\r\nand he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses\r\nagainst the United States, except in cases of impeachment.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] Elsewhere it is made the duty of the president to see \"that the laws\r\nare faithfully executed.\" The execution of the law may sometimes require\r\nforce, hence it seems proper that the command of the army should be vested\r\nin him. Again, an army may be necessary to defend the country. In order\r\nthat it may act promptly and efficiently, it must be directed by one\r\nperson; and the person whom we instinctively designate for the purpose is\r\nthe president.\r\n\r\nThe possession of this power by the president is fraught with danger,\r\nhowever. Unless surrounded by proper checks, it might be used to overturn\r\nour system of government. But the president can hardly, as now situated,\r\nmisuse this power. In the first place, the general rules for the\r\nmanagement and government of the army are made by congress. In the second\r\nplace, the army is supported by appropriations made by congress, and these\r\nare made for short periods. In the third place, congress could reduce or\r\neven abolish the army, if that step seemed necessary in defense of our\r\nliberties. In brief, the support and control of the army are in the hands\r\nof congress; the president merely directs its movements.\r\n\r\nThus far the president has never actually taken the field in command of\r\nthe army; he has appointed military commanders, and has simply given them\r\ngeneral directions, which they have carried out as best they could. At any\r\ntime, however, if dissatisfied with the results, he may change the\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\n[2] The president cannot personally see to the carrying out of all the\r\nlaws, and yet he is the one responsible for their execution. To assist\r\nhim, the work is divided up into parts, and each part is placed in the\r\nhands of an officer appointed by the president (with the consent of the\r\nsenate) and responsible to him. These persons constitute what is known as\r\nthe cabinet, and all but two have the title secretary.\r\n\r\nThe one who keeps the originals of the public documents, the great seal,\r\nand the public records, is called the secretary of state. He is to the\r\nUnited States somewhat as the clerk is to the district or town, or the\r\nauditor to the county. But in addition, he is the one who has charge of\r\nour relations with foreign countries. He is the one to whom you would\r\napply for a passport, if you were going to travel in foreign lands. He has\r\nan assistant and many subordinate officers. In this department are three\r\nbureaus, as they are called--the diplomatic, the consular, and the\r\ndomestic. (For further information, see pages 321, 349, 350.)\r\n\r\nThe officer who has general charge of the receiving and paying out of\r\nmoney is called the secretary of the treasury. He has two assistants and\r\nthousands of subordinates, some in Washington and others throughout the\r\ncountry. Under his direction money is coined, \"greenbacks\" and other\r\ntokens of indebtedness are issued and redeemed. He also has general charge\r\nof all government provisions for making navigation safe along the coast,\r\nsuch as lighthouses, etc.\r\n\r\nAll that pertains to executive control of the army is in charge of the\r\nsecretary of war. The chiefs of bureaus in this department are army\r\nofficers. The secretary may or may not be. The military academy at West\r\nPoint is also, as we might expect, in charge of this department. (See p.\r\n311.)\r\n\r\nThe control of the navy is exercised by the secretary of the navy. The\r\nchiefs of bureaus here are navy officers. The secretary may or may not be.\r\nThis department has charge of the construction of war ships and the\r\nequipment of them; and, as we would expect it has charge of the naval\r\nacademy at Annapolis (p. 311).\r\n\r\nThe department which has the greatest diversity of duties is that of the\r\ninterior. This department has charge of patents and trade-marks, of\r\npensions, of United States lands, of the Indians, of the census, and of\r\neducation. Its chief officer is called the secretary of the interior. The\r\nchiefs of bureaus in this department, except that of the census, are\r\ncalled commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe chief officer of the postoffice department is called the postmaster\r\ngeneral. Here there are five bureaus, in charge respectively of\r\nappointments, contracts, finances, money orders, and foreign mail.\r\n\r\nThe officer who has charge of prosecution or defense of suits for or\r\nagainst the United States is called the attorney general. He is to the\r\nUnited States what the county attorney is to the county. He has, of\r\nnecessity, many assistants. All United States district attorneys and\r\nmarshals act under direction of this department. He is also legal adviser\r\nof the government.\r\n\r\nBy an act approved February 11, 1889, the department of agriculture was\r\nestablished with appropriate duties assigned to it.\r\n\r\nThe practice of holding regular cabinet meetings was begun by Jefferson,\r\nand has continued as a matter of custom and expediency ever since. The\r\nmeetings are attended only by the president, his private secretary, and\r\nthe cabinet. They are held for the purpose of consultation. The president\r\nmay act upon the advice of his cabinet or not as he chooses.\r\n\r\nThe reports or opinions referred to in the provision of the constitution\r\nnow under consideration, are called for at least once a year and are\r\ntransmitted to congress with the president's message. But they may be\r\ncalled for at any time.\r\n\r\nCabinet officers are not directly authorized by the constitution, but\r\nprovisions of this section seem to take it for granted that the president\r\nwould have such assistants.\r\n\r\n[3] This power extends to military offenses as well as to the criminal\r\noffenses of civilians.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has decided that the president has power also to commute\r\nsentences; and that he may act in the matter at any time after the offense\r\nis committed, even before the trial. He may also stop proceedings in any\r\ncriminal case prosecuted in the name of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe exception in case of impeachment was first made in England, to prevent\r\nthe king from shielding his ministers. It is in our constitution as a\r\nsimilar check upon the president.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Powers shared by the Senate._\r\n\r\n_He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the senate, to\r\nmake treaties, provided that two-thirds of the senators present concur;[1]\r\nand he shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nsenate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls,\r\njudges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States,\r\nwhose appointments are not otherwise herein provided for, and which shall\r\nbe established by law;[2] but congress may by law vest the appointment for\r\nsuch inferior officers as they may think proper, in the president alone,\r\nin the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] The \"advice\" of the senate is rarely, if ever, asked; but its\r\n\"consent\" must be had in order to make the treaties lawful.\r\n\r\nFor the mode of making treaties, see pp. 320, 350, 360.\r\n\r\nThe power to make treaties was confided to the president originally\r\nbecause it had been the custom for the executive to possess the\r\ntreaty-making power. But it is defensible on other grounds. Some treaties\r\nneed to be considered secretly. This could hardly be done if congress were\r\nthe treaty-making power. But the president and the cabinet can consider\r\nthe matter in secret. Then promptness is sometimes needed, as in case of a\r\ntreaty to close a war. Promptness may prevent useless loss of life. If\r\ncongress had to be summoned, valuable time would be taken. As two-thirds\r\nof the senators present must agree to the provisions of the treaty, the\r\npresident cannot misuse the power granted in this provision.\r\n\r\nWhen the treaty necessitates the raising of money, the house of\r\nrepresentatives is generally consulted, also. In fact, if the house\r\nopposed such a treaty it is questionable whether it could be carried out.\r\nIn each of the three great purchases of territory the president consulted\r\ncongress before making the purchase.\r\n\r\n[2] The nominations are made in writing, and the senate may either confirm\r\nor reject the nominees. The person or persons confirmed are then appointed\r\nby the president. When a nominee is rejected, the president generally\r\nsends in a new nomination.\r\n\r\nThis mode of appointment is thus defended by Alexander Hamilton, in the\r\n_Federalist:_ \"The blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the president\r\nsingly and absolutely. The censure of rejecting a good one would lie\r\nentirely at the door of the senate; aggravated by the consideration of\r\ntheir having counteracted the good intentions of the executive. If an ill\r\nappointment should be made, the executive for nominating, and the senate\r\nfor approving would participate, though in different degrees, in the\r\nopprobrium and disgrace.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be noted in this connection that, while in the state most of the\r\nofficers are elected, in the general government all officers except the\r\npresident and vice-president are appointed.\r\n\r\nIn Washington's administration the question was raised, can the president\r\nremove officers without the consent of congress? And it was decided that\r\nthe president can remove all officers whom he can appoint. Judges, who\r\nhold for life, are of course excepted. During Johnson's administration,\r\nthe power of the president in this direction was declared to be exactly\r\nequal to his power of appointment,--that is, if the consent of the senate\r\nbe necessary to an appointment, it would also be necessary for removal.\r\nBut afterwards the law was amended, so that now the president may suspend\r\nan officer until the end of the next session of the senate, and make a\r\ntemporary appointment. If the senate does not at its next session confirm\r\nthe nomination to fill the vacancy, the old officer is re-instated. But if\r\nthe president is determined to carry his point, he may immediately suspend\r\nthe old officer again, and re-appoint the rejected candidate, and continue\r\nso to do.\r\n\r\nDuring the early administrations comparatively few removals were made,\r\nexcept where it seemed necessary for the improvement of the public\r\nservice. But Andrew Jackson introduced into our politics the proposition,\r\n\"To the victors belong the spoils;\" which means that the party electing\r\nthe president should have all the offices. This view of the case presents\r\nto every public officer the temptation to secure himself in place, not by\r\nmeritorious service in the line of his duty, but by activity in the\r\nservice of his party; the tendency is, to displace love of country and\r\ndevotion to duty, and to substitute therefor subserviency to strong party\r\nleaders. So crying has the evil become, that many of the wisest and most\r\npatriotic men in the country are seeking to so far reform the public\r\nservice that an officer may feel reasonably secure in his position so long\r\nas he performs his duties faithfully, and that vacancies shall be filled\r\nby the promotion of worthy subordinates.\r\n\r\n[3] This is to secure two objects: first, to relieve the president of the\r\nburden of appointing thousands of such officers; and second, to place the\r\nappointment in the hands of the officers responsible for the work of these\r\nsubordinates.\r\n\r\nThe principal officers thus appointed are:\r\n\r\n1. Postmasters having salaries less than $1000 a year, appointed by the\r\npostmaster general.\r\n\r\n2. Clerks, messengers, janitors, etc., in the several departments,\r\nappointed by the respective secretaries. The chiefs of bureaus and some of\r\nthe more important officers in each department are appointed by the\r\npresident with the consent of the senate.\r\n\r\n3. The subordinates in each custom house, appointed by the collector\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n4. Clerks of United States courts, appointed by the judges. The United\r\nStates district attorneys and marshals are appointed by the president,\r\nwith the consent of the senate.\r\n\r\nThe term of appointees is four years, unless sooner removed. They may be\r\nand are removed, however, as before said, not only for unfitness, but also\r\nfor political reasons.\r\n\r\n_Clause 3.--Temporary Appointments._\r\n\r\n_The president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen\r\nduring the recess of the senate, by granting commissions which shall\r\nexpire at the end of their next session._\r\n\r\nThis provision is necessary because the senate is not always in session,\r\nand it would not pay to convene it for the purpose of acting upon\r\nnominations every time a vacancy occurs. The president may wait, however,\r\nif the case will permit, until the next session of congress before making\r\nan appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--DUTIES OF THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n_He shall from time to time give to congress information of the state of\r\nthe Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall\r\njudge necessary and expedient;[1] he may on extraordinary occasions,\r\nconvene both houses or either of them,[2] and in case of disagreement\r\nbetween them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them\r\nto such time as he shall think proper;[3] he shall receive ambassadors and\r\nother public ministers;[4] he shall take care that the laws be faithfully\r\nexecuted,[5] and shall commission all officers of the United States.[6]\r\n\r\n[1] The president complies with this provision by sending to congress at\r\nthe beginning of each regular session his annual message. And at other\r\ntimes, as occasion demands, he sends special messages.\r\n\r\n[2] Congress has been convened in extra session by presidential\r\nproclamation only twelve times in all. The senate is frequently convened\r\nin extra session at the close of the regular session to consider\r\nappointments. This usually happens on the accession of a new president.\r\n\r\n[3] No occasion has ever arisen for the exercise of this power.\r\n\r\n[4] In all governments, diplomatic intercourse with other governments is\r\ncarried on through the executive department. (See pages 347 and 349.)\r\n\r\nBy \"receiving\" an ambassador, the country from which he comes is\r\n\"recognized\" as an independent sovereignty, a nation. Ambassadors may be\r\nrejected or dismissed, if personally objectionable to this country, if the\r\ncountries from which they come are not recognized as belonging to the\r\nsisterhood of nations, or if the relations between their country and this\r\nbecome unfriendly. Nations at war with each other do not exchange\r\nambassadors; each recalls its representative at the time of declaring war.\r\nOur ambassadors or other public ministers may be rejected by other nations\r\nfor the reasons given above.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be seen that this power or duty may impose upon the\r\npresident at times, grave responsibility. The nature of this\r\nresponsibility may be understood when we remember the efforts made by the\r\nconfederate states to secure recognition of their agents at the courts of\r\nLondon and Paris, during the civil war. For either country to have\r\nrecognized them would have been to interrupt our friendly relations with\r\nthat country, and might have led to war between it and us. (See page 347.)\r\n\r\n[5] This is the president's most important duty; and it is his duty to\r\nenforce the law whether he believes in its wisdom or not. He acts through\r\nthe executive officers previously referred to.\r\n\r\n[6] The commission bears the signature of the president and the great seal\r\nof the United States, the latter affixed by the secretary of state.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--RESPONSIBILITY OF OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n_The president, vice-president, and all civil officers of the United\r\nStates, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction\r\nof, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors._\r\n\r\nThe word \"civil\" in the provision is used here in distinction from\r\n_military_ and _naval_. It is generally understood that members of\r\ncongress are not \"civil officers\" within the meaning of this provision.\r\nMilitary and naval officers are tried by courts-martial, and members of\r\ncongress are subject to trial by the house to which they belong.\r\n\r\nThe definition of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" rests with the senate.\r\nTreason is defined in the constitution, and bribery has a meaning\r\nunderstood by all.\r\n\r\nThere have been seven cases of impeachment before the United States\r\nSenate. (See pages 131, 138 and 333.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWhen, near the close of the late war, General Grant commanded all the\r\narmies of the Union, had he any superior officer? (That is, was there any\r\nofficer higher in rank than he?) Who is commander-in-chief of the United\r\nStates army today? Who is the highest purely military officer, and what is\r\nhis rank?\r\n\r\nName the members of the present cabinet. If you wanted to trade with the\r\nIndians, to whom would you make application for permission?\r\n\r\nCan the president pardon before trial? What cases can he not pardon? Name\r\nsome one pardoned by the president. Could he pardon prisoners confined for\r\nbreach of state law? Where does the general government confine its\r\nprisoners?\r\n\r\nWhat is the smallest number of senators that could confirm or reject a\r\ntreaty? What is meant by the executive session of the senate? How could\r\nyou witness the proceedings at such a session? How large a vote is\r\nnecessary to confirm a nomination of the president?\r\n\r\nWhat is an ambassador? A minister? A consul? What is meant by \"inferior\"\r\nofficers? By \"civil service reform?\"\r\n\r\nState the principle which seems to cover the matter of removals.\r\n\r\nHave you read the president's last annual message? What \"information\" did\r\nhe give to congress? What \"recommendations\" did he make? How was the\r\nmessage delivered to congress? What \"extra sessions\" of congress do you\r\nremember? What ones have you read about in books? When were the different\r\nextra sessions called?\r\n\r\nGive the number of bills vetoed by each president.\r\n\r\nHas the president ever had to adjourn congress? For how long could he do\r\nit? How is the British parliament prorogued?\r\n\r\nWhere do impeachments originate? By whom are they tried? Who may be\r\nimpeached? What for? Can persons who have ceased to be officers be\r\nimpeached? What is the extent of sentence? Was President Johnson\r\nimpeached? How is an impeachment trial conducted? What persons have been\r\nimpeached?\r\n\r\nPrepare a tabulation telling:\r\n\r\n  1.

Duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nARTICLE III.--THE JUDICIAL BRANCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the two articles so far considered, we have studied about the\r\nlaw-_making_ and the law-_enforcing_ branches of the government. We shall\r\nnext examine the third great branch, the one which _interprets_ and\r\n_applies_ the laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\n_The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme\r\nCourt,[1] and in such inferior courts as the congress may from time to\r\ntime ordain and establish.[2] The judges both of the Supreme and inferior\r\ncourts, shall hold their offices during good behavior,[3] and shall at\r\nstated times receive for their services a compensation[4] which shall not\r\nbe diminished during their continuance in office.[5]_\r\n\r\n[1] The creation of the Supreme Court, a distinct coordinate branch for\r\nthe final interpretation of law, was the master-stroke of the\r\nconstitution. \"The Supreme Court has no prototype in history.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the _existence_ of the Supreme Court is thus provided for in the\r\nconstitution, the _number of judges_ to constitute it was wisely left with\r\ncongress. Thus the organization may be changed as circumstances change.\r\nThe Supreme Court at first consisted of six justices, as they are called;\r\nbut owing to the growth of the country and the consequent increase of\r\nlabor to be performed, the number of justices has been increased to nine.\r\n\r\n[2] Under this provision congress has established three grades of\r\n\"inferior\" United States courts, the Circuit Courts of Appeal, Circuit\r\nCourts, and the District Courts. The United States is divided into nine\r\njudicial _circuits_, to each of which are assigned one justice of the\r\nSupreme Court and two circuit judges. (See page 307.) These constitute\r\nwhat is called the Circuit Court of Appeals, having appellate jurisdiction\r\nin their respective circuits and holding annual sessions for that purpose.\r\n(See page 210.)\r\n\r\nThe United States is further subdivided into more than sixty judicial\r\n_districts_. In each of these districts, at least one session of the\r\ncircuit court and one of the district court is held each year. (See pages\r\n210 and 307-9.) A full circuit court bench consists of a supreme court\r\njustice, a circuit judge, and a district judge; but court may be held by\r\nany one or two of them. The district court consists of the district judge.\r\n\r\n[3] This virtually means during life. The purpose of this provision is to\r\nraise the judges above temptation, to put them in a position where they\r\nmay feel safe in doing their exact duty, unawed by any outside power. If\r\nwith this opportunity they prove unjust, they may be impeached. But so\r\nfar, almost without exception, those who have been honored with a place on\r\na United States court have proved worthy of their high calling.\r\n\r\n[4] The purpose of this also is to remove temptation from the judges. The\r\nsalary of the chief justice is $10,500 a year, and that of each associate\r\njustice, $10,000. This seems like a generous amount. But several times a\r\nplace on the supreme bench has been declined, on the plea that the nominee\r\ncould not afford to serve for the salary attached.\r\n\r\n[5] This is to prevent the other two branches from occupying a threatening\r\nattitude toward the judiciary. But the salary may be increased. And the\r\nsalary may be reduced, to take effect with appointments made after the\r\npassage of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS.\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Extent._\r\n\r\nThe judicial power shall extend to all cases,[1] in law and equity,[2]\r\narising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and\r\ntreaties made or which shall be made, under their authority;[3] to all\r\ncases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls;[4] to\r\nall cases of admiralty jurisdiction;[5] to controversies to which the\r\nUnited States shall be a party;[6] to controversies between two or more\r\nstates;[7] between a state and citizens of another state;[8] between\r\ncitizens of different states;[9] between citizens of the same state\r\nclaiming lands under grants of different states;[10] and between a state\r\nor the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.[11]_\r\n\r\n[1] The courts decide what the law is, whether a specified law is\r\nconstitutional or not, and what the meaning of constitutional provisions\r\nis, but only as these questions arise in _cases_ brought before them for\r\ntrial. They do not advise congress or the president as to the\r\nconstitutionality or unconstitutionally of a law. They do not directly\r\nmake law. But in determining the meaning of certain laws and of\r\nconstitutional provisions they may determine what the law is, and thus\r\nthey may be said to make law indirectly. But sometimes a legal question or\r\na question as to the meaning of a constitutional provision remains for a\r\nlong time unanswered, because no _case_ involving the question comes\r\nbefore the courts.\r\n\r\n[2] Sometimes the law provides no adequate remedy for a wrong. Here is the\r\nnecessity for a court of equity. For instance, A sells his business to B,\r\nagreeing not to become a rival, but immediately reopens in the next block.\r\nB's only remedy in law is to secure damages. If this remedy is shown to be\r\ninadequate, a court of equity will close A's store. Or if C, having\r\ncontracted to do a certain act for D, fails or declines to perform his\r\npart, the law can only award D damages; equity will compel the fulfillment\r\nof the contract. Law is curative, equity is preventive. (See Dole, 502.)\r\n\r\nIn some states there are separate courts of law and of equity. But the\r\nprovision under discussion gives the United States courts jurisdiction in\r\ncases both of law and of equity. \"There are no juries in equity cases, and\r\nno criminal trials.\"\r\n\r\n[3] These pertain to the whole United States, so cases arising under them\r\nshould be tried by a national, not by a state, court.\r\n\r\n[4] Thus showing respect for the governments represented by them.\r\n\r\n[5] That is, to cases arising on the high seas or on navigable waters.\r\nThese matters, according also to I. 8: 10, 11, are under the jurisdiction\r\nof the United States, and therefore this provision is simply a consequence\r\nof the two referred to.\r\n\r\n[6] Because then the interests of the whole country are at stake, and\r\nshould not be left to any state.\r\n\r\n[7] Because the United States was organized to \"insure domestic\r\ntranquility.\"\r\n\r\n[8] This provision has been modified by the eleventh amendment, which\r\nreads as follows: \"The judicial power of the United States shall not be\r\nconstrued to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted\r\nagainst one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by\r\ncitizens or subjects of any foreign state.\" That is, if the state is the\r\n_plaintiff_, the suit may be tried by the United States Supreme Court\r\n(compare clause 2). Claims of individuals against a state, if denied by\r\nthe auditor, may be referred by them to the legislature. A state cannot be\r\nsued by an individual or corporation.\r\n\r\nWhen a citizen is sued he must be sued either in the courts of the United\r\nStates or in those of his own state. It would be a source of irritation to\r\ncompel a state to sue a citizen of another state in the courts of his own\r\nstate, hence this provision that such suits shall be in the United States\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n[9] To remove temptation to injustice through local prejudice. But the\r\nsuit is tried in, and in accordance with the laws of, the state of which\r\nthe defendant is a citizen.\r\n\r\n[10] Because the states are involved in the suit, and it would be unfair\r\nto let either decide the controversy.\r\n\r\nThis provision is not of much importance now, because state boundaries are\r\nclearly defined. But when the constitution was framed, this kind of\r\nquestion meant a good deal. The charters given during colonial times were\r\nvery loosely drawn, and claims of different colonies and proprietors\r\noverlapped each other. The question of ownership had not been settled at\r\nthe time of the revolution. During the formative or confederation period,\r\nthese disputes had been a source of much ill-feeling.\r\n\r\n[11] Because the general government, and not the individual states, has\r\ncharge of our foreign relations. A foreign country holds the United States\r\nresponsible for the acts of its citizens; and only the United States can\r\nbe looked to, to secure justice to its citizens on the part of foreign\r\ncountries or citizens.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court._\r\n\r\n_In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls,\r\nand those in which a state shall be a party, the Supreme Court shall have\r\noriginal jurisdiction.[1] In all the other cases before mentioned, the\r\nSupreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction,[2] both as to law and\r\nfact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress\r\nshall make.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] That is, such a suit must _commence_ in the Supreme Court, and so\r\ncannot be tried elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[2] That is, the action must commence in some lower court, but it may be\r\nappealed to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. District Court has jurisdiction over crimes committed on the high\r\nseas, and over admiralty cases in general; over crimes cognizable by the\r\nauthority of the United States (not capital) committed within the\r\ndistrict, and over cases in bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Circuit Court has original jurisdiction in civil suits involving\r\n$2000 or more, over equity cases, and over cases arising under patent and\r\ncopyright laws.\r\n\r\n[3] To relieve the Supreme Court, which was years behind with its work,\r\ncongress recently provided for a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in each of\r\nthe nine circuits, which has final appellate jurisdiction in nearly all\r\ncases except those involving the constitutionality of a law.\r\n\r\n_Clause_ 3.--_The Trial of Crimes._\r\n\r\n_The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by\r\njury,[1] and such trial shall be held in the state where said crimes shall\r\nhave been committed;[4] but when not committed within any state,[3] the\r\ntrial shall be at such place or places as congress may by law have\r\ndirected.[4]_\r\n\r\n[1] A trial by jury is a trial by twelve men impartially selected. This is\r\nregarded as one of the great bulwarks of liberty.\r\n\r\nCivil cases may, at the desire of both parties, be tried by the court\r\nonly. But for criminal trials a jury is guaranteed by this provision. In a\r\ncriminal trial, the state or the nation is the prosecutor, and state or\r\nnational judges _might_ be tempted to decide unjustly, if the matter were\r\nleft to them.\r\n\r\n[2] This leaves the accused in better condition to defend himself, than if\r\nhe could be taken away far from home. He is thus able at the least expense\r\nto bring witnesses in his own behalf. In harmony with this, each state has\r\nat least one U. S. District Court for the trial of crimes against the\r\ngeneral government. (See Declaration of Independence.)\r\n\r\nThis provision is probably binding also upon the states.\r\n\r\n[3] That is, in the District of Columbia, in one of the territories, in\r\nthe Indian country, in the forts or arsenals of the United States, or upon\r\nthe high seas.\r\n\r\n[4] Congress has specified courts for the trial of such crimes. Those\r\ncommitted on the high seas are tried in the state where the vessel\r\narrives. (See pages 230-4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--TREASON.\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Definition and Trial._\r\n\r\n_Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war\r\nagainst them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and\r\ncomfort.[1] No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the\r\ntestimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open\r\ncourt.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] Treason is, in essence, a deliberate and violent breach of the\r\nallegiance due from a citizen or subject to his government. Being directed\r\nagainst the powers that be, the government in self defense is tempted to\r\npunish it severely. The more tyrannical a government is the more likely it\r\nis to be plotted against, and the more suspicious it becomes. If treason\r\nwere undefined, the government might declare acts to be treasonable which\r\nthe people never suspected to be so. This had occurred so many times, and\r\ngood men had so often been sent on this charge to an ignominious death,\r\nthat the framers of the constitution deemed it prudent to define treason\r\ncarefully in the fundamental law itself.\r\n\r\nThese provisions are taken from the famous statute of Edward III which\r\nfirst defined treason in England. This statute declared five things to be\r\ntreasonable, only the third and fourth of which are held by our\r\nconstitution to be so.\r\n\r\n[2] An overt act is an open act, not one that is simply meditated or\r\ntalked about, but one actually performed.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has decided that there must be an actual levying of war;\r\nthat plotting to overthrow the government is not treason. But if\r\nhostilities have actually begun, if war has commenced, \"all those who\r\nperform any part, however minute, or however remote from the scene of\r\naction, and who are leagued in the general conspiracy, are to be\r\nconsidered traitors.\"\r\n\r\nTwo witnesses, at least, \"to the _same_ overt act,\" are required, because\r\nthus only can a \"preponderance of testimony\" be secured.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Punishment._\r\n\r\n_The congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but\r\nno attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture\r\nexcept during the life of the person attainted._\r\n\r\nAs has been hinted, the punishment of treason had been very severe in\r\nEuropean countries. Not only was the person convicted of treason put to\r\ndeath in the most horrible ways, but his property was forfeited, and no\r\none could inherit property from him or through him. Thus not only the\r\nperson himself, but also his children and his children's children, were\r\npunished. The purpose of this provision is, in the words of Mr. Madison,\r\nto restrain congress \"from extending the consequences of guilt beyond the\r\nperson of its author.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nBy what authority was the Supreme Court established?

And\r\nthe congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts,\r\nrecords and proceedings shall be proved,[5] and the effect thereof._\r\n\r\n[1] That is, such faith and credit as would be given to such acts, etc.,\r\nin the state in which they originated.\r\n\r\n[2] That is, the legislative acts,--the statutes and the constitutions.\r\n\r\n[3] Such as the registration of deeds, wills, marriages, journals of the\r\nlegislature, etc.\r\n\r\n[4] The proceedings, judgments, orders, etc., of the courts.\r\n\r\n[5] The records of a court are \"proved\" (that is, shown to be authentic)\r\nby the attestation of the clerk, with the seal of the court affixed, and\r\nthe certificate of the judge. The acts of the legislature are\r\nauthenticated by the state seal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--RELATIONS TO INHABITANTS OF OTHER STATES.\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Citizens._\r\n\r\n_The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens in the several states._\r\n\r\nThat is, no state can give its citizens any privileges which it denies to\r\ncitizens of other states. For instance, a citizen of Wisconsin, New York\r\nor California, coming to Minnesota has all the privileges of a citizen of\r\nMinnesota. To be sure he cannot vote in Minnesota until he has resided\r\nhere for a time. This is simply a police regulation, to prevent fraud in\r\nvoting. But he is entitled to the protection of the laws of Minnesota, may\r\nhold property here, and may engage in any business in which a citizen of\r\nMinnesota may engage.\r\n\r\nHe cannot, however, carry with him any special privileges which he may\r\nhave enjoyed in the state from which he came. Thus, if one state permits a\r\nperson to vote upon declaring his intention to become a citizen while\r\nanother requires that a voter shall be a full citizen, a person coming\r\nfrom the first state cannot claim the right to vote in the second until he\r\nbecomes a full citizen.\r\n\r\nStudy in this connection the first clause of the fourteenth amendment.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--Fugitives from Justice._\r\n\r\n_A person charged in any state with treason, felony or other crime, who\r\nshall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall, on demand\r\nof the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered\r\nup, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime._\r\n\r\nThe necessity for this provision will readily be understood, when it is\r\nremembered that each state has jurisdiction only within its own limits.\r\nBut for this provision, criminals would be comparatively free from\r\nrestraint, because they could in most cases get into another state. And\r\nthis would of course tend to increase the number of criminals. (See pp.\r\n337, 349.)\r\n\r\nAs civilization advances, countries independent of each other politically\r\nagree, for their mutual protection, to surrender to each other fugitives\r\nfrom justice. Treaties made for this purpose are called _extradition_\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\n_Clause 3.--Fugitives from Service._\r\n\r\n_No person held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof,\r\nescaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation\r\ntherein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered\r\nup on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due._\r\n\r\nThis clause was inserted as a concession to the slave-holding states, and\r\nhad special reference to slaves, though it also applied to apprentices and\r\nany other persons who for any reason might be \"bound to service.\" But as\r\nslavery no longer exists, and apprenticeship and other binding to service\r\nare almost things of the past, this provision is practically obsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--NEW STATES AND TERRITORIES.\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--The Admission of New States._\r\n\r\n_New states may be admitted by the congress into this Union;[1] but no new\r\nstate shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other\r\nstate;[2] nor shall any state be formed by the junction of two or more\r\nstates or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the\r\nstates concerned as well as of the congress.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] These few words mark an era in political history. Heretofore nations\r\nhad acquired new territory merely to enlarge the extent of their\r\n_provinces_ or subject states, never with a view of uniting the acquired\r\nterritory with the original system, allowing it equal political\r\nprivileges. But when we look at the matter carefully, we shall see that\r\nour government could not consistently do otherwise than it did. The\r\nproposition involved in the revolution was that new territory should\r\neither be permitted to enjoy equal privileges with the parent state, or it\r\nshould become independent.\r\n\r\nBut it was not simply to carry out a political theory that this provision\r\nwas made; it was to solve a practical difficulty. At the close of the\r\nRevolutionary War, the United States extended west to the Mississippi\r\nriver. The territory west of the Alleghany mountains contained almost no\r\ninhabitants, and was of course unorganized. This territory became the\r\nobject of contention. Some of the states claimed jurisdiction over it,\r\nwhile others maintained that it was not within the limits of any states,\r\nand that, as it had been secured by a war waged by the general government,\r\nthis territory should be considered common property, to be managed by the\r\ngeneral government. The states having claims upon the territory expressed\r\na willingness to relinquish them upon the condition that the territory\r\nshould be formed into states as soon as the population would warrant.\r\nAccordingly, before the constitution was framed all these states except\r\nNorth Carolina and Georgia had relinquished their claims, and all but a\r\nsmall portion of the territory was under the jurisdiction of the general\r\ngovernment. And July 13, 1787, that portion of the country west of\r\nPennsylvania and north of the Ohio, had been organized into the Northwest\r\nTerritory. This act of congress is generally known as The Ordinance of\r\n1787. It was for a long time the model upon which other territories were\r\norganized.\r\n\r\n[2] This shows the fear entertained lest the general government should try\r\nto control a state by threatening its existence.\r\n\r\n[3] Vermont was claimed by both New York and New Hampshire. Both consented\r\nto her admission.\r\n\r\nKentucky was a part of Virginia, and became a state with her consent.\r\n\r\nMaine became a state with the consent of Massachusetts, of which it had\r\nbeen a part.\r\n\r\nWest Virginia was admitted during the war, the consent of Virginia being\r\nobtained afterwards.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--The Territories._\r\n\r\n_The congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules\r\nand regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to\r\nthe United States;[1] and nothing in this constitution shall be so\r\nconstrued as to prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any\r\nparticular state.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] The power to _acquire_ territory is not expressly granted in the\r\nconstitution, but it is implied as an act of sovereignty. Territory was\r\nacquired by the general government before the constitution by cession from\r\nstates, and since the adoption of the constitution it has been acquired by\r\npurchase, by discovery, by conquest, and by annexation.\r\n\r\nThe power to _dispose_ of territory is also an attribute of sovereignty,\r\nand would have belonged to the general government without this provision.\r\nBut this provision places the power in the hands of _congress_; otherwise\r\nland could be sold by the treaty-making power. Under this provision\r\ncongress receded to Virginia that portion of the District of Columbia\r\nsouth of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nThe power to govern any territory which it possesses is also an attribute\r\nof sovereignty. This clause gives the power to congress; but any law for\r\nthe regulation of territories needs the president's signature, the same as\r\nany other law.\r\n\r\n[2] It will be remembered that North Carolina and Georgia had not at the\r\ntime of the adoption of the constitution relinquished their claims to\r\ncertain territory lying outside of their state limits. This provision was\r\nmade as a concession to them. But they afterwards, North Carolina in 1790\r\nand Georgia in 1802, ceded the disputed territory to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--GUARANTIES TO THE STATES.\r\n\r\n_The United States shall guarantee to every state in this Union a\r\nrepublican form of government,[1] and shall protect each of them against\r\ninvasion,[2] and on application of the legislature, or of the executive\r\n(when the legislature cannot be convened), against domestic violence.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] That is, the United States will protect each state against one man or\r\na few men who may try to usurp the functions of the state government. By\r\ninference, the United States could insist upon a republican form of\r\ngovernment even if the people of the state desired some other. Happily, no\r\nnecessity for the exercise of this power has yet arisen.\r\n\r\n[2] This would have been the duty of the general government, even if this\r\nprovision had not been made. To defend the country against invasion is one\r\nof the principal duties of government. The government was organized \"to\r\nprovide for the common defense.\"\r\n\r\n[3] To \"insure domestic tranquillity\" was another reason given for the\r\nestablishment of the constitution. But lest the general government should\r\nmake every little disturbance a pretext for interfering with the local\r\naffairs of a state, it was provided that no interference should occur\r\nuntil asked for by state authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions_.\r\n\r\nIf a judgment is secured against a resident of New York and he moves to\r\nMinnesota without paying it, could he be held responsible in Minnesota\r\nwithout another suit?

If these\r\nexist, the amendments may be made; the difficulty is not so great as to be\r\ninsurmountable.\r\n\r\n[2] By reading the clauses referred to, the student will readily see whom\r\nthis was a concession to.\r\n\r\n[3] This was to protect the small states, in whose interest the senate was\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nThe first ten amendments were proposed by congress at its first session in\r\n1789, and they were ratified in 1791.\r\n\r\nTwo other amendments were proposed at the same time, but they were not\r\nratified. One of them was to regulate the number of representatives; the\r\nother, to prevent congressmen from increasing their own salaries.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh amendment was proposed in 1796, and ratified in 1798.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth amendment, a consequence of the disputed election of 1801, was\r\nproposed in 1803, and ratified in 1804.\r\n\r\nAn amendment prohibiting citizens of the United States from accepting any\r\ntitles, pensions, presents, or other emoluments from any foreign power, on\r\npain of loss of citizenship, was proposed in 1811, but it was not\r\nratified.\r\n\r\nAn amendment making slavery perpetual was proposed in 1861, in the hope\r\nthat this might avert the war, but it was not ratified.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth and fourteenth amendments were proposed in 1865 and 1868\r\nrespectively, and they were ratified the same years.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth amendment was proposed in 1869, and ratified in 1870.\r\n\r\nThe propositions of amendments have thus far been made by congress, and\r\nall ratifications have been made by the state legislatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nState four ways in which the constitution may be amended. What _temporary_\r\nlimitation was placed upon the power to amend the constitution? What\r\n_permanent_ prohibition? How is the English constitution amended? In what\r\ncase _must_ congress call a convention to propose amendments? Must the\r\nconvention thus called propose any amendments? Which is the better of the\r\ntwo ways of proposing amendments? When an amendment is proposed by\r\ntwo-thirds of both houses of congress, is it necessary to secure the\r\napproval of the president? Can a state withdraw its ratification of an\r\namendment? When is an amendment, once proposed, dead? Did it take\r\nthree-fourths of _all_ the states or only three-fourths of the loyal\r\nstates to ratify the thirteenth amendment? How many of the disloyal states\r\nfinally ratified it? How is the ratification and consequent validity of\r\nany proposed amendment made known?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nARTICLE VI.--MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clause 1.--Prior Debts and Engagements._\r\n\r\n_All debts contracted and engagements entered into before the adoption of\r\nthis constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this\r\nconstitution as under the confederation._\r\n\r\nThe debts were incurred and the engagements were entered into by the\r\nUnited States, and changing the _form of government_ would not release the\r\ncountry from its obligations. The insertion of this provision however,\r\nserved as an explicit statement of the purpose of the government to live\r\nup to its engagements.\r\n\r\n_Clause 2.--National Supremacy._\r\n\r\n_This constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made\r\nin pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under\r\nthe authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land;\r\nand the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the\r\nconstitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding._\r\n\r\nThis provision settles definitely, and in what would seem to be\r\nunmistakable terms, the question of supremacy, about which so much\r\ndiscussion has been carried on. Within its sphere, within the limitations\r\nplaced upon it by the constitution itself, the national government has the\r\nsupremacy over any and all state governments.\r\n\r\n_Clause 3.--Oath of Office._\r\n\r\n_The senators and representatives before mentioned, and the members of the\r\nseveral state legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers, both\r\nof the United States and of the several states, shall be bound by oath or\r\naffirmation, to support this constitution;[1] but no religious test shall\r\never be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under\r\nthe United States.[2]\r\n\r\n[1] The first law passed by congress under the constitution was an act\r\nprescribing the form of the oath required by the provision above. It is as\r\nfollows: \"I, A. B., do solemnly swear, or affirm (as the case may be),\r\nthat I will support the constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n[2] In all other countries at the time of the adoption of this\r\nconstitution eligibility to public office was limited to members of the\r\nestablished church of the country. This constitution set the example of\r\nabolishing religious tests for public office, and the wisdom of this is so\r\napparent that it has been followed entirely or in part by many of the\r\ncivilized nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nARTICLE VII.--RATIFICATION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient\r\nfor the establishment of this constitution between the states so ratifying\r\nthe same._\r\n\r\nNine states made two-thirds of the entire number. Eleven states ratified\r\nthe constitution within nine months of the time of its submission to them.\r\nAs soon as nine states had ratified, congress made arrangements for\r\nputting the new form of government into operation.\r\n\r\nThe mode of ratification herein specified ignored the existence of the\r\narticles of confederation, and in specifying this mode the convention\r\ndisregarded the instructions of the congress which called it. The congress\r\nhad expressly provided that the work of the convention should be submitted\r\nto the congress and the state legislatures for approval. But this\r\nprovision places the power to ratify in the hands of conventions elected\r\nby the people in the several states, which arrangement is in harmony with\r\nthe opening words of the preamble.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWhat is the recognized law of nations in regard to the payment of the\r\ndebts of a nation when it changes its form of government? If England\r\nshould become a republic would this rule apply? Does it apply when a\r\nterritory becomes a state? Were the debts of the confederation paid? How?\r\nWhat was the amount of the debt of the United States at the time of the\r\nadoption of the constitution? What is the value of the notes and bonds of\r\nthe \"Confederate States of America\"? Why?\r\n\r\nWhich is sovereign, the nation or the individual states? Where else are\r\nthere any provisions which teach the same thing? Why should _judges_ be\r\nspecially mentioned in VI. 2? What department of the government makes\r\ntreaties? Are they binding upon the other departments? Upon the several\r\nstates? Can a state nullify an act of congress? Has any state ever tried\r\nto do so?\r\n\r\nWhy are _state_ officers bound to support the constitution of the _United\r\nStates_? Is the requirement to take the \"oath of office\" a religious test?\r\nWhy is the choice of oath or affirmation given? What was the iron-clad\r\noath?\r\n\r\nWould the ratification of the constitution by nine states have made it\r\nbinding upon the other four? The articles of confederation required the\r\nconsent of all the states to any amendment to them; by what right was this\r\nconstitution adopted against the wishes of Rhode Island and North\r\nCarolina? If those two states had persisted in their refusal to ratify the\r\nconstitution, what would have been their relations to the United States?\r\nJustify your answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE AMENDMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now considered the constitution about as it was presented to the\r\nstates for ratification. Judging by our own affection for the noble\r\ninstrument we would expect to learn that it was ratified promptly and\r\nunanimously. But, as a matter of fact, much hard work was required on the\r\npart of its friends to secure its ratification. Its every provision had to\r\nbe explained and justified. Probably the most able exposition was made by\r\nHamilton, Madison and Jay, in a series of papers entitled, \"The\r\nFederalist.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest objections urged against the constitution was that it\r\ndid not guarantee sufficiently the rights of individuals. It will be\r\nremembered in this connection that the principal grievance against\r\nEngland, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, was that\r\npersonal rights had not been respected; and that, in consequence, the\r\nfirst form of government organized after independence, The Articles of\r\nConfederation, gave the general government no power to reach individuals.\r\nExperience showed this to have been a mistake, and the constitution\r\nauthorizes the general government to execute its laws directly, enabling\r\nit to hold individuals responsible. On account of this re-enlargement of\r\npower, many people honestly feared that the new government might trespass\r\nupon personal rights as England had done. And several states at the time\r\nof ratifying suggested the propriety of so amending the constitution as to\r\nremove these fears.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these recommendations, amendments were proposed at the\r\nfirst session of congress. The house of representatives proposed\r\nseventeen, to twelve of which the senate agreed. Only ten, however, were\r\nratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states. They are, of\r\ncourse, the first ten among those that follow. It was decided by the same\r\ncongress that the amendments should not be incorporated into the main body\r\nof the constitution, but should be appended to it as distinct articles.\r\nThey have, however, the same force as the original constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF RELIGION, OF SPEECH, AND OF ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\n_Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\r\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof;[1] or abridging the freedom of\r\nspeech or of the press;[2] or the right of the people peaceably to\r\nassemble and to petition the government for a redress or grievances.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] The chief purpose for which many of the early settlers came to America\r\nwas that they might \"worship God according to the dictates of their own\r\nconscience.\" Hence their descendants put _first_ among the individual\r\nrights to be protected, this freedom of religion. But this provision does\r\nnot authorize any one to commit crime in the name of religion.\r\n\r\n[2] The only limitation upon speech in this country is that the rights of\r\nothers be respected. Any one may think as he pleases upon any subject, and\r\nmay freely express his opinion, provided that in doing so he does not\r\ntrespass upon the rights of others.\r\n\r\n[3] It would seem that under a republican form of government this right\r\nmight be assumed to be secure. The provision is meant to \"make assurance\r\ndoubly sure.\" History had shown the necessity of such precaution.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE II.\r\n\r\nRIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.\r\n\r\n_A well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state,\r\nthe right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed._\r\n\r\nIt should not be the policy of a republic to keep a large standing army.\r\nAn army is expensive, it takes so many men from productive industries, and\r\nit is dangerous to liberty--it may from its training become the instrument\r\nof tyranny.\r\n\r\nBut a republic must have defenders against foes foreign or domestic. A\r\nwell-trained militia may be depended upon to fight with valor against a\r\nforeign foe, and may at the same time serve as a check upon usurpation.\r\n\r\nFor definition of _militia_, see page 162.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE III.\r\n\r\nQUARTERING SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\n_No soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house without the\r\nconsent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be described\r\nby law._\r\n\r\nTo \"quarter\" soldiers in any house is to allot them to it for food and\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nThis, it will be remembered, was one of the grievances of the colonies.\r\nThis quartering of soldiers had been, and indeed is in some countries to\r\nthis day, a mode of watching and worrying persons for whom officers of the\r\ngovernment entertained suspicion or ill will.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE IV.\r\n\r\nSECURITY AGAINST UNWARRANTED SEARCHES.\r\n\r\n_The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,\r\nand effects, against unreasonable searches, and seizures, shall not be\r\nviolated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported\r\nby oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be\r\nsearched, and the persons or things to be seized._\r\n\r\nThis, as well as the preceding provision, recognizes the maxim, \"A man's\r\nhouse is his castle.\" It prevents the issuance of general warrants.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE V.\r\n\r\nSECURITY TO LIFE, LIBERTY AND PROPERTY.\r\n\r\n_No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous\r\ncrime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury,[1] except in\r\ncases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in\r\nactual service in time of war, or public danger;[2] nor shall any person\r\nbe subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or\r\nlimb;[3] nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness\r\nagainst himself,[4] nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without\r\ndue process of law;[5] nor shall private property be taken for public use\r\nwithout just compensation.[6]\r\n\r\n[1] For information in regard to the method of conducting criminal trials,\r\nsee Division I.\r\n\r\n[2] The necessity here for prompt and exact obedience to orders is so\r\nurgent, that summary methods of trial must be permitted.\r\n\r\nFor information regarding trial by court martial, see appendix, page 338.\r\n\r\n[3] That is, when a jury has rendered its verdict and judgment has been\r\npronounced, the accused cannot be compelled to submit to another trial on\r\nthe same charge. But if the jury disagrees and fails to bring in a\r\nverdict, he may be tried again.\r\n\r\n[4] Accused persons used to be tortured for the purpose of extorting from\r\nthem a confession of guilt.\r\n\r\n[5] In a despotism, the lives, liberty and property of the people are at\r\nthe command of the ruler, subject to his whim.

Says\r\nMontesquieu, \"Liberty consists in security. This security is never more\r\nattacked than in public and private accusations. It is, therefore, upon\r\nthe excellence of the criminal laws that chiefly the liberty of the\r\ncitizen depends.\" And Lieber, in his very able work on Civil Liberty and\r\nSelf-Government, says, \"A sound penal trial is invariably one of the last\r\nfruits of political civilization, partly because it is one of the most\r\ndifficult of subjects to elaborate, and because it requires long\r\nexperience to find the proper mean between a due protection of the\r\nindicted person and an equally due protection of society.... It is one of\r\nthe most difficult things in all spheres of action to induce irritated\r\npower to limit itself.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the guarantees of the constitution, Lieber mentions the following\r\nas characteristic of a sound penal trial: the person to be tried must be\r\npresent (and, of course, living); every man must be held innocent until\r\nproved otherwise; the indictment must be definite, and the prisoner must\r\nbe allowed reasonable time to prepare his defense; the trial must be oral;\r\nthere must be well-considered law of evidence, which must exclude hearsay\r\nevidence; the judge must refrain from cross-examining witnesses; the\r\nverdict must be upon the evidence alone, and it must be _guilty_ or _not\r\nguilty;_ [Footnote: In some countries the verdict may leave a stigma upon\r\nan accused person, against whom guilt cannot be proven. Of this nature was\r\nthe old verdict, \"_not proven._\"] the punishment must be in proportion to\r\nthe offense, and in accordance with common sense and justice; and there\r\nmust be no injudicious pardoning power, which is a direct interference\r\nwith the true government of law.\r\n\r\nMost, if not all but the last, of the points mentioned by Dr. Lieber are\r\ncovered by that rich inheritance which we have from England, that\r\nunwritten constitution, the common law. The question of how best to\r\nregulate the pardoning power is still unsettled.\r\n\r\n[1] He may have his trial at the next term of court, which is never very\r\nremote. But the accused may, at his own request, have his trial postponed.\r\n\r\n[2] Publicity is secured by the keeping of official records to which all\r\nmay have access, by having an oral trial, by the admission of spectators\r\nto the court room, and by publication of the proceedings in the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n[3] For the mode of securing the \"impartial jury,\" see page 63.\r\n\r\n[4] It is provided in the body of the constitution (III., 2, 3,) that\r\ncriminal trial shall be by jury, and in the state where the crime was\r\ncommitted. This amendment makes the further limitation that the trial\r\nshall be in the _district_ where the crime was committed, so a person\r\naccused of crime cannot be put to the trouble and expense of transporting\r\nwitnesses a great distance.\r\n\r\n[5] The nature of the accusation is specified in the _warrant_ and in the\r\nindictment, both of which, or certified copies of them, the accused has a\r\nright to see.\r\n\r\n[6] Not only do the witnesses give their evidence in the presence of the\r\naccused, but he has also the right to cross-examine them.\r\n\r\n[7] But for this \"compulsory process\" (_called a subpoena_), persons\r\nentirely guiltless might be unable to produce evidence in their own\r\nbehalf. The natural desire of people to \"keep out of trouble\" would keep\r\nsome knowing the circumstances of the case from giving their testimony,\r\nand others would be afraid to speak up for one under a cloud and with all\r\nthe power of the government arrayed against him.\r\n\r\n[8] The accused may plead his own cause, or he may engage a lawyer to do\r\nit for him. If he is too poor to employ counsel, the judge appoints a\r\nlawyer to defend him, whose services are paid for out of the public\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing, it will be seen that great care is exercised to give a\r\nperson accused of crime full opportunity to defend himself. And it must be\r\nremembered in this connection that it is a principle of our jurisprudence\r\nthat _the burden of proof lies upon the government_. That is, the accused\r\nis to be deemed innocent until he is _proved_ guilty. We prefer that a\r\nnumber of guilty persons should escape punishment rather than that one\r\ninnocent person should suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VII.\r\n\r\nJURY TRIAL IN COMMON LAW SUITS.\r\n\r\n_In suits at common law,[1] where the amount in controversy shall exceed\r\ntwenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved; and no fact\r\ntried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any court of the United\r\nStates, than according to the rules of common law.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] The meaning of this expression is difficult of explanation, but it\r\ncovers most ordinary lawsuits. From the fact that a jury in criminal cases\r\nhas already been guaranteed (III., 2, 3, and Am. VI.), it may be assumed\r\nthat this provision is intended to cover civil suits.\r\n\r\n[2] Among the \"rules of common law\" are these: 1. All suits are tried\r\nbefore a judge and a jury, the jury determining the _facts_ in the case\r\nand the judge applying the _law_. 2. The facts tried by a jury can be\r\nre-examined only by means of a new trial before the same court or one of\r\nthe same jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this provision is to preserve the jury trial as a real\r\ndefense against governmental oppression. In the Supreme Court there is no\r\njury; the trials are by the court. If questions of _fact_ could be\r\nreviewed or re-examined by such a court on appeal the protection now given\r\nby the jury would be nullified.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE VIII.\r\n\r\nEXCESSIVE BAILS, FINES AND PUNISHMENTS FORBIDDEN.\r\n\r\n_Excessive bail shall not he required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor\r\ncruel and unusual punishments inflicted._\r\n\r\nHaving enjoyed the protection of this and similar provisions for so many\r\nyears, we can hardly appreciate their value. It must be borne in mind that\r\nthose who \"ordained and established\" the constitution had been abused in\r\njust these ways, and that in this provision they provided against a real\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE IX.\r\n\r\nUNSPECIFIED PERSONAL RIGHTS PRESERVED.\r\n\r\n_The enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be\r\nconstrued to deny or disparage others retained by the people._\r\n\r\nCertain rights which governments are prone to trample on have been\r\nmentioned in the preceding provisions. But not all of the personal rights\r\ncould be enumerated. Hence this provision covering those unnamed.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE X.\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ONE OF LIMITED POWERS.\r\n\r\n_The powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor\r\nprohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively,\r\nor to the people._\r\n\r\nThis provision gives a rule for interpreting the constitution. \"It is\r\nimportant as a security against two opposite tendencies of opinion, each\r\nof which is equally subversive of the true import of the constitution. The\r\none is to _imply_ all powers, which may be useful to the national\r\ngovernment, which are not _expressly prohibited;_ and the other is, to\r\n_deny_ all powers to the national government which are not _expressly\r\ngranted_.\" [Footnote: Story] The United States is \"a government of limited\r\npowers,\" and has only such implied powers as are necessary to carry out\r\nthe express powers. On the other hand, a state has all powers not denied\r\nto it by the state or federal constitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWhat is the general purpose of the first ten amendments? Do they restrict\r\nthe general government or the state governments, or both? When and how\r\nwere these amendments proposed? When and how ratified? What three\r\nlimitations to the power of amendment does the constitution contain?\r\n\r\nIs there any \"established\" or state church in the United States? How do\r\nyou suppose that this came about? Are we as a people indifferent to\r\nreligion? Can a person say what he pleases? Can he publish whatever\r\nopinions he pleases? What is _slander?_ _Libel?_ Why should these last two\r\nquestions be asked here? Petition whom? What's the good of petitioning?\r\nWhat petitions did you learn about at the beginning of this study? Can\r\nsoldiers in the regular army petition? Why? Has the \"right of petition\"\r\never been denied in this country?\r\n\r\nWherein is a standing army dangerous to liberty? Is this true of the navy?\r\nHow is a \"well-regulated militia\" a check upon usurpation of authority?\r\nDoes Amendment II. authorize you to keep a revolver? To carry it in your\r\npocket? How often is the army mentioned in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and what is said?\r\n\r\nWhat are the objections to \"quartering\" soldiers in a private house? Does\r\nthe amendment protect tenants? Why the exception in the amendment? What\r\nmention of quartering soldiers in the Declaration of Independence?\r\n\r\nGet and read a warrant of arrest. A search warrant. Has a warrant always\r\nbeen needed as authority for arrest? Are arbitrary arrests, searches and\r\nseizures permitted in any civilized countries today?\r\n\r\nWhat is a capital crime? An infamous crime? A presentment? An indictment?\r\nA grand jury? How do the proceedings of a grand jury compare with those of\r\na petit jury? Why the differences? Why the exception in the first clause\r\nof the amendment? Can a convicted and sentenced person ask for a new\r\ntrial? Under what other circumstances can persons be tried again? In what\r\nconnections have you heard of private property being taken for public use.\r\n\r\nTaking each guarantee in the sixth amendment, show the wrongs which an\r\naccused person, presumably innocent, would suffer if the provision were\r\nnot recognized or that guarantee removed.\r\n\r\nFind out all you can about _common law_. What is meant by a _civil_ suit\r\nas distinguished from a _criminal_ suit? What is meant by a case in\r\n_equity?_ When an appeal is taken what is subject to re-examination? What\r\nis not? Why?\r\n\r\nWhat conditions determine the just amount of bail? Of fines? What cruel\r\npunishments have you heard or read of as being administered by public\r\nauthority? When and where were such punishments not \"unusual\"? Was the\r\neighth amendment necessary? What limit is there to things which \"The\r\nPeople\" may do? To the powers of the United States government? To those of\r\na State government?\r\n\r\nFind the history behind each provision in the ten amendments. From what\r\ncountry did we obtain the notions that the rights here preserved belong to\r\nfreemen? From under what other country could the Colonies have come ready\r\nto be the United States as we love it, or from what other country could we\r\nhave inherited such notions?\r\n\r\nSince these ten amendments are intended for the protection of individuals\r\nagainst governmental oppression, it will be an excellent scheme now for\r\nthe student to arrange in the form of a tabulation the various directions\r\nin which such protection is guaranteed by the constitution as amended. The\r\nfollowing is simply suggestive:\r\n\r\nI. From Legislative Oppression.--1. Thought; 2. Expression; 3. Bills of\r\nAttainder; 4. _Ex post facto_ laws; 5. Social distinctions; 6. Assembly;\r\n7. Petition.\r\n\r\nII. From Executive Oppression.-1. Military; 2. Searches and seizures; 3.\r\nLife, Liberty, or Property; 4. Suspension of _Habeas Corpus_.\r\n\r\nIII. From Judicial Oppression.-1. Before trial: arrest, bail, information\r\nas to accusation, time of trial; 2. During trial: publicity, jury,\r\nevidence, counsel, punishment; 3. After trial: retrial; 4. Treason.\r\n\r\nIV. From State oppression.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XI.\r\n\r\nLIMITING THE JURISDICTION of UNITED STATES COURTS.\r\n\r\n_The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend\r\nto any suit in law or equity,[1] commenced or prosecuted against one of\r\nthe United States[2] by citizens of another state, or by citizens or\r\nsubjects of any foreign state.[3]_\r\n\r\n[1] Equity is hard to define. According to Aristotle it is \"the\r\nrectification of the law, when, by reason of its universality, it is\r\ndeficient.\" Blackstone says, \"Equity, in its true and genuine meaning, is\r\nthe soul and spirit of all law.... Equity is synonymous with justice.\" It\r\nis the province of law to establish a code of rules whereby injustice may\r\nbe prevented, and it may therefore be said that all law is equitable. \"In\r\na technical sense, the term equity is applied to those cases not\r\nspecifically provided for by positive law.\" (See page 208; also Dole's\r\nTalk's About Law, page 502.)\r\n\r\n[2] According to III. 2, a state could be sued for a debt the same as an\r\nindividual, and shortly after the adoption of the constitution several of\r\nthem were sued for debts incurred during the Revolutionary War. Pride and\r\npoverty both prompted the states to desire immunity from such suits. Hence\r\nthe adoption of this amendment. (See page 209.)\r\n\r\n[3] A non-resident secures the payment of a debt due from a state in the\r\nsame way as a resident--by legislative appropriation.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XII.\r\n\r\nMODE OF CHOOSING THE PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\nThe amendment has been discussed in connection with Article II. of the\r\nconstitution, pages 184-6.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIII.\r\n\r\nABOLITION OF SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n_1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for\r\ncrime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist\r\nwithin the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction._\r\n\r\n_2. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate\r\nlegislation._\r\n\r\nThis amendment, one of the \"first fruits\" of the Civil War, put an end to\r\nslavery in the United States. The wording was taken, almost verbatim, from\r\nthe Ordinance of 1787.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XIV.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS RECONSTRUCTION PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--\"CITIZEN\" DEFINED. PRIVILEGES GUARANTEED.\r\n\r\n_All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the\r\njurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state\r\nwherein they reside.[1] No state shall make or enforce any law which shall\r\nabridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor\r\nshall deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process\r\nof law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\r\nprotection of the laws.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] This provision defines citizenship. It was worded with the special\r\nview of including the negroes. It embodies the principle of the Civil\r\nRights Bill, and is intended to guarantee to the negroes the protection\r\nimplied in citizenship.\r\n\r\n[2] Some of the amendments impose limitations only on the general\r\ngovernment. Lest the states in which slavery had recently been abolished\r\nshould endeavor to oppress the ex-slaves this provision was made as a\r\nlimitation upon the states.\r\n\r\nBut this provision is general in it nature, and by means of it the United\r\nStates can protect individuals against oppression on the part of the\r\nstates. Pomeroy [Footnote: Constitutional Law, p. 151.] regards this as\r\nthe most important amendment except the thirteenth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--BASIS of REPRESENTATION.\r\n\r\n_Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according\r\nto their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each\r\nstate, excluding Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote at any\r\nelection for the choice of electors for president and vice-president of\r\nthe United States, representatives in congress, the executive and judicial\r\nofficers of a state, or the members of the legislature thereof, is denied\r\nto any of the male inhabitants of such state, being twenty-one years of\r\nage, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for\r\nparticipation in rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation\r\ntherein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male\r\ncitizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years\r\nof age in such state._\r\n\r\nEach state determines who may vote within its borders. This provision was\r\nintended as an _inducement_ to the former slave states to grant franchise\r\nto the colored men. It does not _compel_ them to do this. But granting the\r\nfranchise increases their representation. The fifteenth amendment is more\r\n_imperative_ in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--DISABILITIES of REBELS.\r\n\r\n_No person shall be a senator or representative in congress, or elector of\r\npresident or vice-president, or hold any office, civil or military, under\r\nthe United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an\r\noath, as a member of congress, or as an officer of the United States, or\r\nas a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or judicial\r\nofficer of any state, to support the constitution of the United States,\r\nshall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given\r\naid or comfort to the enemies thereof.[1] But congress may, by a\r\ntwo-thirds vote of each house, remove such disability.[2]_\r\n\r\n[1] The primary purpose of this provision was to exclude from public\r\noffice those who in the Civil War, by entering the service of the\r\nConfederate States, broke an oath previously taken. Though the persons\r\nwhom it was immediately intended to affect will soon all be \"with the\r\nsilent majority,\" the provision, by being made part of the constitution,\r\nwill remain a warning to all in the future.\r\n\r\n[2] The disabilities have been removed from all but a few of those\r\nimmediately referred to. This clause seems to put another limitation upon\r\nthe power of the president to grant pardons. From 1862 to 1867 the\r\npresident had been specially authorized by congress to grant amnesty to\r\npolitical offenders. And in 1867 President Johnson continued to grant such\r\namnesty, denying the power of congress to put any limitation upon the\r\npresident's pardoning power. But this provision specifically places the\r\npower to relieve certain disabilities in the hands of congress. The\r\n\"two-thirds\" vote is required in order that such disabilities may not be\r\neasily removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.--PUBLIC DEBT.\r\n\r\n_The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law,\r\nincluding debts incurred for the payment of pensions, and bounties for\r\nservices in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be\r\nquestioned. But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or\r\npay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion\r\nagainst the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of\r\nany slave, but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held\r\nillegal and void._\r\n\r\n_Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the\r\nprovisions of this article._\r\n\r\nThis section needs little comment. It means simply that any expense\r\nincurred on the part of government in suppressing rebellion _shall be\r\npaid_; and that debts incurred in aid of rebellion _shall not be paid_. It\r\napplies not only to the late Civil War but to all future wars of the same\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE XV.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\n_The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or\r\nabridged by the United States, or by any state, on account of race, color,\r\nor previous condition of servitude._\r\n\r\n_Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate\r\nlegislation._\r\n\r\nThis amendment was intended to put negroes upon the same footing as white\r\npeople in the matter of suffrage.\r\n\r\nEach state, as has previously been stated, prescribes the qualifications\r\nof voters within its borders. It may require that they be fifteen or\r\ntwenty-five or twenty-one or any other number of years old; it may or may\r\nnot require a property qualification; it may or may not require an\r\neducational qualification; it may include or exclude women as voters; it\r\nmay draw the line at imbeciles and felons, but it cannot draw the color\r\nline. A black citizen must be permitted to vote upon the same conditions\r\nas a white one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by a state \"repudiating\" a debt? What states have done so?\r\nWhat reason did each assign for doing so? Can a city repudiate? A county?\r\n\r\nWere amendments XIII., XIV., and XV. constitutionally adopted?

[Footnote: See page 343.]\r\nWhat does the emancipation proclamation say about slavery? Can slavery\r\nexist in Alaska? Why?\r\n\r\nAre you a citizen of the United States? How may an alien become a citizen?\r\nMay a person be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of\r\nany state? A citizen of a state without being a citizen of the United\r\nStates? [Footnote: See Wright, 287.] How does a citizen of the United\r\nStates become a citizen of a certain state? What are some of the\r\n\"privileges and immunities\" of a citizen of the United States? [Footnote:\r\nSee Wright, 287.] Can a Chinaman become a citizen? An Indian? Does this\r\nsection give women the right to vote?\r\n\r\nWhat provision of the constitution is amended by the second clause of the\r\nfourteenth amendment? What change is made? How often does the \"counting\"\r\ntake place? What is it called? When will the next one occur? Has the\r\npenalty mentioned in the second clause ever been inflicted?\r\n\r\nName persons affected by the third clause of the fourteenth amendment.\r\nName persons from whom the disabilities have been removed. How were they\r\nremoved? Name persons against whom the disabilities still lie. May they\r\nvote? What provision of the original constitution is affected by the last\r\nsentence of this clause, and how is it modified?\r\n\r\nHow much money was expended in suppressing the rebellion? How was it\r\nraised? How much debt has been paid? How much remains unpaid? Did you ever\r\nsee a United States bond or note? How much is a confederate bond for $1000\r\nworth? Why? Have any emancipated slaves been paid for by the government?\r\n\r\nWhat is the necessity of the clause commencing, \"The congress shall have\r\npower?\"\r\n\r\nWhat is secured to negroes by the thirteenth amendment? By the fourteenth?\r\nBy the fifteenth? Name persons who are citizens but cannot vote. Name\r\nthree eminent colored men.\r\n\r\nWhat clause could be omitted from the constitution without affecting it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nFORMS OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassification.--Aristotle divided governments into three chief classes,\r\nbased upon the number of persons constituting the governing element, as\r\nfollows: government by _one_, monarchy; by the _few_, oligarchy; by the\r\n_many_, democracy.\r\n\r\nSubdivisions of these classes may be made as follows.\r\n\r\n1. By _one_, monarchy; hereditary or elective; absolute or limited.\r\n\r\n2. By the _few_, oligarchy or aristocracy.\r\n\r\n3. By the _many_, democracy or republic.\r\n\r\nDefinitions and examples.--A hereditary monarchy is one in which the\r\nsuccession is acquired by birth, the usual order being from father to\r\neldest son; examples, England, Prussia, etc.\r\n\r\nAn elective monarchy is one in which the succession is by election; the\r\nterm for life; example, the old German empire, in which the emperor was\r\nchosen by certain princes called \"electors.\" [Footnote: Our mode of\r\nelecting a president may have been suggested in part by this old\r\npractice.]\r\n\r\nAn absolute monarchy is one in which the three functions of government as\r\nrelated to law--the legislative, executive and judicial--are all vested in\r\none person; examples, Russia and Turkey in Europe, and most of the\r\ncountries of Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nA limited monarchy is one in which the sovereign's power is confined\r\nchiefly to executing the laws framed and interpreted by other departments;\r\nexamples, England, and most of the other countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nAn oligarchy is that form of government in which the supreme power is\r\nvested in the hands of a few (_oligos_, few); example, the triumvirates of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nAn aristocracy is really a government by the best (_aristos_, the select,\r\nthe best). This is the sense in which the word was first used. It has come\r\nto mean government by a privileged class. Aristocracy seldom, if ever,\r\nexists alone.\r\n\r\nA democracy is that form of government in which the functions are\r\nadministered directly by the people, only the clerical or ministerial work\r\nbeing done by officers, and they appointed by the people; examples, the\r\nold German tribes, some of the states of ancient Greece, some of the\r\npresent cantons of Switzerland, the early settlements of New England, and\r\nin a limited sense our own school districts and towns.\r\n\r\nA republic is a representative democracy. A democracy is practicable only\r\nwithin a very limited area. When the area grows large the people must\r\ndelegate much of work of government to representatives. Examples, the\r\nUnited States, each state in the Union, Switzerland, and most of the\r\ncountries of America.\r\n\r\nThe Origin of Each Typical Form.--Monarchy and oligarchy both probably owe\r\ntheir existence to war. The successful chieftain or leader in war became\r\nthe king, and his retainers or followers became the privileged classes.\r\nThose who were subdued either became slaves or were simply \"the common\r\npeople.\" Democracy had its beginnings, and flourishes best, in times of\r\npeace. The people, though they had to fight again and again to secure\r\nrecognition, have really won their right to it by the arts of peace.\r\n\r\nThe Criteria of Good Government.--Among the tests by which the goodness or\r\nbadness of a government, or form of government, may be determined, are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1. A good government is _stable_. Stability is the foundation of\r\nworthiness of character in governments as well as in persons. The basis of\r\nprogress is permanence--one cannot grow wise, or rich, or strong, unless\r\nhe can preserve at least a part of what he gains. \"Conduciveness to\r\nprogress includes the whole excellence of government.\" [Footnote: Mills\r\nRepresentative Government.]\r\n\r\n2. A good government _tends to increase the sum of good qualities in the\r\ngoverned_. Strength comes from exercise. Therefore a government is\r\nexcellent in proportion as it works up to the possibilities of a people\r\nfor self-government and fits them to go on advancing in intellectual and\r\nmoral power.\r\n\r\n3. A good government _has proper machinery_. This should be \"adapted to\r\ntake advantage of the amount of good qualities which may at any time\r\nexist, and make them instrumental to right purposes.\" [Footnote: Mills\r\nRepresentative Government.]\r\n\r\n\"Representative Government the Ideally Best Polity.\"--Every student who\r\nhas access to Mills' Representative Government should read the chapter\r\nwith the heading at the beginning of this paragraph. He combats the\r\nproposition, \"if a good despot could be insured, despotic monarchy would\r\nbe the best form of government.\" Granting that much good might be done, he\r\nshows that the very passivity of the people must result in deterioration,\r\n\"that is, if the nation had ever attained anything to decline from.\" On\r\nthe other hand, he shows that participation in public affairs gives a\r\nmental and moral training otherwise unattainable. After showing the nature\r\nof the mental development acquired, he says: \"Still more salutary is the\r\nmoral part of the instruction afforded by the participation of the private\r\ncitizen, if even rarely, in public functions. He is called upon, while so\r\nengaged, to weigh interests not his own; to be guided, in case of\r\nconflicting claims by another rule than his private partialities; to\r\napply, at every turn, principles and maxims which have for their reason of\r\nexistence the general good; and he usually finds associated with him in\r\nthe same work minds more familiarized than his own with these ideas and\r\noperations, whose study it will be to supply reasons to his understanding,\r\nand stimulation to his feeling for the general good. He is made to feel\r\nhimself one of the public, and whatever is their interest to be his\r\ninterest. Where this school of public spirit does not exist ... a\r\nneighbor, not being an ally or an associate, since he is never engaged in\r\nany common undertaking for the joint benefit, is therefore only a rival.\"\r\n\r\nDangers in Each Form of Government.--While each of the typical forms has\r\nmerits of its own,--the monarchy having stability, the aristocracy\r\nsecuring the benefit of inherited good qualities, and democracy the\r\nadvantages referred to in the preceding paragraph--there is danger in each\r\nform. Monarchy continually tends toward that inconsiderate exercise of\r\npower which we call tyranny. Aristocracy tends toward oligarchy;\r\ngovernment by the _best_ is prone to decline into government by the _few_\r\nwithout regard to qualification. And democracy is in danger of\r\ndegenerating into mob rule.\r\n\r\nEvery Government Aims to be Aristocratic.--That is, each government in\r\ntheory seeks to have those rule who are best fitted to manage public\r\naffairs. This is the thought, for instance, in our requiring certain\r\nqualifications in voters and office-holders.\r\n\r\nOur Own Government.--We fondly believe that our own government combines to\r\na high degree the excellencies of all the forms.\r\n\r\nOur hope for stability lies chiefly in the fact that our corner stone is\r\neternal justice, the equality of all men before the law. Even the severe\r\nshock of civil war has been endured, and our system is more strongly\r\nintrenched in the confidence of the world than ever before.\r\n\r\nWe believe in the potency of good blood and good training. But the worth\r\nof each individual must be _shown_, it will not be taken for granted. We\r\nwill neither lift him up because he is \"his father's son,\" nor cast him\r\ndown because his father was unworthy.\r\n\r\nSituated as we are, with no powerful rivals near us, with the ocean\r\nbetween us and the countries of Europe, the common defense requires no\r\ngreat standing army to eat up our substance and to menace our liberties.\r\nLiving in the north temperate zone, the belt of highest civilization, in a\r\ncountry capable of producing almost everything desirable, there is every\r\nreason to believe that, if we are true to ourselves and our opportunities,\r\nwe may long enjoy prosperity and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Debate_.\r\n\r\nResolved, That universal suffrage is dangerous to the well being of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBILITY.\r\n\r\n_Ignorance of the law is no excuse._\r\n\r\nAt first sight this would seem unjust, since no one but a lawyer can be\r\nexpected to have much legal knowledge. But as law is simply common sense\r\napplied, the exercise of ordinary judgment is usually sufficient to enable\r\na person to act safely.\r\n\r\nTo present a few of the more common principles of commercial law, is the\r\npurpose of the following pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinitions.--A contract is an agreement between two or more parties,\r\ncontaining on the one hand an _offer_ and on the other an _acceptance_.\r\n\r\nContracts are _express_ or _implied_. An express contract is one whose\r\nterms are definitely stated in words; an implied contract is one whose\r\nterms are understood from the circumstances. A written contract is express;\r\nan oral contract may be express or implied.\r\n\r\nFundamental Principles.--Every one able to contract is free to enter into\r\nany agreement not forbidden by law. Every such person is bound to fulfill\r\nevery legal contract that he makes.\r\n\r\nEssential to a Contract.--To be binding, however:\r\n\r\n_1. A contract must be to do a lawful act._\r\n\r\nMost contracts are permitted by law. But a contract the carrying out of\r\nwhich is recognized as subversive of justice, morality, or the general\r\nwelfare, is illegal, and therefore void.\r\n\r\n_2. The thing contracted to be done must be possible in its nature._\r\n\r\nThat a person finds it impossible _under the circumstances_ to live up to\r\nhis contract should not and does not release him from responsibility.\r\n\r\n_3. The parties to the agreement must be competent to contract._\r\n\r\nPersons not able to contract are minors, lunatics, idiots and drunk\r\npeople, and married women (except in some states in relation to their\r\nseparate estates). The purpose of this arrangement is to protect those who\r\ncannot protect themselves. A minor may, however, enforce a contract if he\r\nchooses to do so. A contract with a minor for the necessaries of life,\r\nwhen they are not or cannot be furnished by a parent or guardian, is\r\nvalid. And any contract ratified by a minor after coming of age is binding\r\nupon him. A person unable to contract personally cannot contract through\r\nan agent. But he may act as an agent.\r\n\r\n_4. The parties to the contract must assent to it._\r\n\r\nThe assent must be voluntary. It may be given by words, by acts, or by\r\naccepting the benefits of the offer. If acceptance is by letter, the\r\ncontract is complete when the letter of acceptance is mailed. The parties\r\nmust assent to the same thing. Assent imposing a new condition is no\r\nassent.\r\n\r\n_5. The promise must be for a consideration._\r\n\r\nThe law will not compel a person to give something for nothing. But the\r\namount of the consideration is usually unimportant, so long as it is\r\nreasonable. Anything is a consideration which is of benefit to the person\r\npromising or of loss or inconvenience to the other. An illegal\r\nconsideration is, however, not a consideration; nor is the performance of\r\na moral duty, nor the doing of what would be a legal duty without the\r\npromise in question. If the consideration fails, the contract fails. One\r\nhas no right to sue on a contract unless he has performed or offered to\r\nperform his part.\r\n\r\n_6. The contract must be made without fraud._\r\n\r\nFraud may be practiced in two ways, by making statements known to be false\r\nor by concealing facts that ought to be revealed. But if the parties meet\r\non equal terms, with the same sources of information, and if nothing is\r\ndone to conceal faults, there is no fraud in law. \"Let the buyer beware,\"\r\nis an ancient maxim, and a buyer must exercise reasonable diligence and\r\nprudence. Fraud absolves the injured party, but the defrauding party may\r\nbe held to the contract; that is, the contract is voidable at the option\r\nof the party deceived.\r\n\r\n_7. Some contracts must be in writing._\r\n\r\nThe principal classes of commercial contracts which must be in writing to\r\nbe binding, are: (a) agreements for the sale of property of more than a\r\ncertain value; (b) agreements of guaranty; (c) agreements not to be\r\nperformed within a year.\r\n\r\nIn the famous English \"Statute of Frauds,\" which is the basis of the\r\nAmerican local statutes on matters referred to in this section, the value\r\nof personal property requiring written contract was ten pounds or fifty\r\ndollars. In the United States the value varies in different states from\r\n$30 to $200. But if part of the property is delivered or part of the\r\npurchase money is paid the whole contract is binding, even if not in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nA guaranty is an agreement by which a person warrants that a certain third\r\nperson shall duly perform an engagement. Thus if A obtains goods from B\r\nupon the assurance of C that they will be paid for, C is said to guarantee\r\nthe debt.\r\n\r\nA contract which _may_ be performed within a year does not come under the\r\nstatute, even if such performance seems improbable at the time of making\r\nthe contract.\r\n\r\nThe style of the writing is immaterial--it may be formal or informal, in\r\nink or pencil. It may be made by the principal or by his agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nHow are the laws--legislative enactments and decisions of the Supreme\r\nCourt--made public? Why are they thus published?\r\n\r\nTell whether the following agreements are valid contracts or not, and why:\r\n\r\n1. An agreement to print a libel. A lease of a house for gambling\r\npurposes. A contract executed on Sunday. A contract for work to be done\r\nfor five consecutive days, beginning on Friday. How would it affect the\r\ncase if the work were the removing of goods from a building in imminent\r\ndanger of falling? The agreement of a tinsmith never again to work at his\r\ntrade. His agreement not to work at it within a specified time or in a\r\ncertain town.\r\n\r\n2. An agreement to swim across the ocean. To pay for a horse at the rate\r\nof one kernel for the first nail in the horse's shoes, two for the second,\r\nfour for the third, eight for the fourth, and so on. To deliver goods at a\r\ncertain time, though the delivery at the proper time may be prevented by\r\nsome accident. Is a person released from responsibility by sickness?\r\n\r\n3. An agreement by an orphan to pay for necessaries at some future time.\r\nIf the price charged is exorbitant, is he bound to pay it or only a fair\r\nmarket price? A man while drunk buys a horse for which he has no use, but\r\nafter becoming sober continues to use the horse. If the price is\r\nexcessive, how much must he pay? When a married women buys goods on\r\ncredit, is she acting as the principal or as her husband's agent?\r\n\r\n4. An order for goods to be sent to a man's house, nothing being said\r\nabout payment. An offer retracted before acceptance. An offer for a\r\ncertain horse; an acceptance under the impression that a different horse\r\nis meant. A service permitted though uninvited; give an example. A man in\r\nSt. Paul offers by letter a certain piece of property at a certain price\r\nto a man in Chicago; an hour after mailing the letter he changes his mind;\r\nhow can he prevent a contract?\r\n\r\n5. A agrees to give B $25 for a silver dime. But if this particular dime\r\nwere of a rare kind and desired by A, a wealthy coin collector, to\r\ncomplete a set, would the consideration be sufficient? An offer shouted\r\nfrom a fourth story window just as the roof is about to fall, in\r\nconsequence of which offer a fireman at unusual personal risk successfully\r\nattempts the rescue. An offer and acceptance for a horse which is\r\nafterwards discovered to have been dead at time of sale. A promise made\r\nunder threat of spreading an infamous report. An agreement for the purpose\r\nof securing the postponement of the payment of a debt. How many\r\n\"considerations\" are there in a valid contract?\r\n\r\n6. The sale of an unfashionable \"ready-made\" suit of clothes, nothing\r\nbeing said about the style. The sale of a plated watch chain, the dealer\r\npermitting the purchaser to suppose it solid gold. The sale of a blind\r\nhorse, nothing being said about its sight, no effort being made to conceal\r\nits blindness, and full opportunity for examination being given to the\r\npurchaser. The sale of a house and lot at a certain price, greater than\r\nthe purchaser had at first intended to give, upon the representation of\r\nthe seller that he had \"been offered\" such a sum. The purchase of a piece\r\nof land which unknown to the vendor contains a valuable mine, nothing\r\nbeing said to mislead said vendor.\r\n\r\n7. An oral order for goods to the value of $500. How does the buyer's\r\nreceiving part of the goods affect the matter? How else could the contract\r\nbe made binding? What position does a person assume by endorsing a note?\r\nBy orally saying that a debt of another will be paid? An oral engagement\r\nmade December first to work a year beginning January first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nAGENCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinitions.--An agent is a person authorized to act for another in\r\ndealing with third parties. The one for whom the agent acts is called the\r\nprincipal.\r\n\r\nAuthority of Agent.--An agent's authority may be granted orally or in\r\nwriting. When written it is called a \"power of attorney.\" A general agent\r\nhas all the authority implied in his employment. A special agent has only\r\nsuch authority as is specifically granted.\r\n\r\nResponsibility of the Principal.--Between the principal and his agent\r\nresponsibility is determined by their contract. Expressly or impliedly the\r\nprincipal agrees to pay for the service rendered.\r\n\r\nIt is in the principal's relation to third parties that the most important\r\nrule of agency appears. It is this: _The principal is responsible for the\r\nauthorized acts of his agent_. The theory is that the acts are those of\r\nthe principal, the agent being merely an instrument. And accordingly, the\r\nprincipal is bound not only by such acts of his agent as he has really\r\nauthorized, but also by such as he _apparently_ authorizes.\r\n\r\nResponsibility of Agent.--The agent is responsible to his principal for\r\nany violation of their contract. Expressly or impliedly he is bound to\r\nobey orders, to exercise ordinary skill and care in the performance of his\r\nduty, and to refrain from putting his interests in adverse relation to\r\nthose of his principal.\r\n\r\nTo the third party the agent is not responsible, except in the following\r\ncases: When he specifically assumes responsibility, when he conceals the\r\nidentity of his principal, when he exceeds his authority, or when he acts\r\nfraudulently.\r\n\r\nTermination of Agency.--An agency terminates at the death of either\r\nprincipal or agent. It may also be terminated by revocation of authority,\r\nwhich takes effect upon receipt of the notice, or by the bankruptcy or\r\nlunacy of the principal, judicially declared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nIn the following cases name the principal, the agent, and the third party:\r\nA clerk in a store; a man employed to sell goods by sample; a cashier in a\r\nbank; a conductor on a train; a commission merchant; a partner acting for\r\na firm, a sheriff.\r\n\r\nMay a minor act as principal? As agent? A watch left at a jeweler's store\r\nfor repairs is injured by the workman; who is responsible to the owner? On\r\naccount of a road overseer's neglect a horse is injured by stepping\r\nthrough a hole in a bridge; to whom shall the owner look for damages? If a\r\nperson is notified that another claims to represent him as agent and he\r\nneglects to repudiate the claim, is he responsible for acts of the\r\nclaimant as agent?\r\n\r\nMay an agent having authority to fix prices sell to himself?\r\n\r\nMay a clerk in a store take goods at regular marked prices?\r\n\r\nAn agent transacts business after his principal's death but before he has\r\nreceived notice thereof, is the transaction binding upon the heirs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nPARTNERSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat it is.--Partnership is the relation existing between persons who have\r\nagreed to combine their property or skill for the prosecution of a given\r\nenterprise, and to share the profits or losses resulting therefrom.\r\n\r\nHow Formed.--Partnership being a matter of agreement is subject to the law\r\nof contracts. When the agreement is in writing, it is called \"articles of\r\ncopartnership.\" The articles usually specify the parties and the firm\r\nname, the nature and the location of the business to be carried on, the\r\ninvestment of each party, the basis for apportioning profits and losses,\r\nand sometimes the duration of the co-partnership. There are generally\r\nother provisions, their nature depending upon the circumstances.\r\n\r\nResponsibility.--As to each other, the partners have the rights and duties\r\nwhich they agree upon.\r\n\r\nAs to third parties, the two most important rules of law are: first, that\r\n_the firm is bound by the acts of each member_, in matters pertaining to\r\nthe firm's business; second, _each member is liable for all the debts of\r\nthe firm_.\r\n\r\nDissolution.--If the duration of the partnership is not specified, it may\r\nbe dissolved by any partner at any time. If its duration is specified, it\r\nexpires, of course, by limitation or by mutual consent. In either case,\r\nthe death of a partner dissolves the firm. If a partner becomes insane or\r\nacts fraudulently, the partnership may be dissolved by a decree of the\r\ncourt. The sale of an interest (which must have the consent of each\r\npartner) dissolves the partnership and forms a new one.\r\n\r\nNotice of Dissolution.--That the retiring partners may be freed from\r\nresponsibility for new debts, if the dissolution be by sale of interest\r\n(and this is a very common way), notice of the dissolution must be given\r\nto the world, and special notice of the fact must be given to those from\r\nwhom the firm has been in the habit of buying.\r\n\r\nLimited Partnership.--In most states, what is called a limited partnership\r\nmay be formed, whereby the responsibility of some of the partners may be\r\nlimited to their investment in the business. By this arrangement the\r\nprivate property of the special partners (as they are called) cannot be\r\ntaken for debts of the firm.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, however, it is but just, and the law therefore demands,\r\nthat notice of the fact of limited responsibility be given and that no\r\nappearance of responsibility be assumed. To this end it is required: (a)\r\nthat the articles of copartnership be in writing, and that they be\r\npublished and recorded; (b) that the amount contributed by the special\r\npartners be actually paid in; (c) that the names of the special partners\r\ndo not appear in the firm name; (d) that they take no active part in the\r\nmanagement of the business.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nWhy are partnerships formed? May one person invest money while another\r\ninvests skill? Is a person who receives a percentage of his sales by way\r\nof salary a partner?\r\n\r\nWhy cannot a partner sell his interest without consulting the other\r\nmembers of the firm? Why may the fraudulent act of a partner dissolve the\r\nfirm? Why does the death of a member end the firm--that is, why not let\r\nhis heir succeed to his right in the firm as he succeeds to his real\r\nestate?\r\n\r\nMay the _private_ property of a partner be taken to satisfy the debts of\r\nhis firm? May the firm's property be taken to satisfy the debt of one of\r\nits members? Can men dissolve their debts by dissolving their partnership?\r\nIf one partner continues the business agreeing to pay all indebtedness of\r\nthe firm, is the retiring partner released from obligation in relation to\r\nthe debts? Show the justice of each requirement in case of special\r\npartners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nCORPORATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurpose--Partnership enables a number of persons, as we have seen, to\r\naccomplish by combining their property and skill what would be\r\nunattainable by them acting individually.\r\n\r\nBut the individual responsibility involved in partnership, and the\r\ndifficulty of transferring interest, render necessary some other mode of\r\ncombining capital for carrying on enterprises requiring vast resources,\r\nand, from their nature, demanding long time and freedom from interruption\r\nfor their accomplishment. For instance, no one would dare to assume\r\npersonal responsibility for the debts of a railroad, nor could such an\r\nenterprise be managed if every transfer of interest dissolved the company.\r\nThe desired limitation of responsibility and facility of transfer of\r\ninterest are secured by the formation of _corporations_.\r\n\r\nNature.--But responsibility there must be, or the combination could\r\ntransact no business. And responsibility depends upon personality--a\r\n_thing_ cannot be held responsible. As this personality does not exist\r\naside from the persons of those uniting their resources, it must be\r\ncreated. The creative power is the legislature. The personality created is\r\nthe corporation. [Footnote: From the Latin _corpus, corporis,_ a body.] A\r\ncorporation is, therefore, an artificial or fictitious person, created\r\nunder general law or by a special act of the legislature, [Footnote: This\r\nspecial act defining the powers and duties of the corporation is called\r\nits _charter_.] and capable of acting within prescribed limits as if it\r\nwere a natural person, but beyond those limits incapable of acting at all.\r\n\r\nManagement.--The persons who contribute to the capital of the corporation,\r\nor company, receive certificates of stock, that is, pieces of paper\r\ncertifying that said persons own so many shares in the company. The\r\ncapital, be it remembered, is the property of the corporation, not of the\r\nindividuals. The number of these stockholders may be large or small, a\r\ndozen or a thousand. The general management of corporate business is\r\nnecessarily entrusted to a small number of persons called directors. These\r\nare elected by the stockholders, each share having one vote. The directors\r\nselect from their own number a president, a secretary, and other necessary\r\nofficers. These persons and the other agents of the corporation carry out\r\nthe policy determined upon by the directors.\r\n\r\nWhy Limited in Powers.--The question suggests itself, Why can a\r\ncorporation do only certain things? The most obvious answer is, that this\r\nis consequent upon its mode of creation. Being a creature of the\r\nlegislature, it can have only those powers which are specifically or\r\nimpliedly granted to it. But pushing the matter farther, it may\r\npertinently be asked, Why doesn't the legislature endow it with power to\r\ndo anything that may properly be done by a natural person? Two reasons, at\r\nleast, appear. First, from the corporation's standpoint, it is a matter of\r\nbusiness prudence to have its purpose and powers defined: (a) to enable it\r\nto secure subscribers to its stock, as no one would like to risk his money\r\nblindly; and (b) because thus only can the directors be held to\r\naccountability. Second, from the standpoint of the public, for whom the\r\nlegislature acts, the defining is necessary in order that corporations may\r\nbe controlled and dangerous combinations prevented.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be noted that corporations are granted some\r\nprivileges not possessed by individuals. For instance, private property\r\nsuch as land may be taken, even against the wishes of the owner, to permit\r\nthe building of a railroad. This can be done, however, only on the ground\r\nof public good, and by giving the owner just compensation.\r\n\r\nResponsibility.--A corporation, like any other person is responsible for\r\nany contracts that it makes, within its charter. It necessarily acts\r\nentirely through agents, hence the law of agency has an important bearing\r\nupon all contracts with a corporation.\r\n\r\nDebts incurred lie against the corporation, not as a rule against the\r\nstockholders individually. Sometimes stockholders are by the charter made\r\nliable to limited extent, say to an amount equal to the par value of their\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nDissolution.--Some companies are incorporated so that they may last\r\nforever. Others are incorporated for a specified time. The latter expire\r\nby limitation or by becoming insolvent. A corporation of either kind may\r\nsecure dissolution by voluntarily surrendering its charter. And sometimes\r\nthe legislature reserves in the charter the right to dissolve the company\r\nunder certain conditions.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of a corporation are usually closed up by a \"receiver,\" who\r\ncollects the bills, disposes of the property, pays the indebtedness as far\r\nas he can, and distributes the residue among the stockholders.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF PARTNERSHIP WITH CORPORATION.\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF         PARTNERSHIP.

The road intersects the farm, and crossing\r\nthe road is a brook containing trout, which have been put there and cared\r\nfor by the farmer; may a boy sit on the public bridge and catch trout from\r\nthat brook? If the road should be abandoned or lifted, to whom would the\r\nuse of the land go?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL PAPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nKinds and Uses.--If a man wishes to buy some commodity from another but\r\nhas not the money to pay for it, he may secure what he wants by giving his\r\nwritten promise to pay at some future time. This written promise, or\r\n_note_, the seller prefers to an oral promise for several reasons, only\r\ntwo of which need be mentioned here: first, because it is _prima facie_\r\nevidence of the debt; and, second, because it may be more easily\r\ntransferred or handed over to some one else.\r\n\r\nIf J.M. Johnson, of Saint Paul, owes C.M. Jones, of Chicago, a hundred\r\ndollars, and Nelson Blake, of Chicago, owes J.M. Johnson a hundred\r\ndollars, it is plain that the risk, expense, time and trouble of sending\r\nthe money to and from Chicago may be avoided, and the indebtedness wiped\r\nout by J.M. Johnson ordering Nelson Blake to pay the hundred dollars to\r\nC.M. Jones. The written order to this effect, called a _draft_, would be\r\nsent to C.M. Jones, who would present it for payment to Nelson Blake, and\r\nupon receiving his money would turn _the draft_ over to Blake.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the risk of being robbed, merchants and some others are in the\r\nhabit of depositing each evening in a bank the receipts of the day, with\r\nthe understanding that the money will be paid out, at any time, to any\r\nperson whom they order it paid to. The order on the bank is called a\r\n_check_.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to see that these three devices are of immense value to\r\nthe commercial world; the first by rendering available future resources,\r\nand the other two by enabling payments to be made safely.\r\n\r\nDefinitions.--A _note_ is an unconditional promise in writing, to pay a\r\ndefinite sum of money at a certain time to a specified person.\r\n\r\nA _draft_ is an order, written by one person and addressed to another,\r\ndirecting him to pay a definite sum of money at a certain time to a\r\nspecified third party.\r\n\r\nA _check_ is a draft for immediate payment, drawn upon a bank or banker.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a note, the person who promises to pay is called the\r\n_maker_ of the note; and the person named to be paid, the _payee_.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a draft or check, the person ordering the payment is called\r\nthe _drawer_; the person addressed, the _person drawn upon_ or the\r\n_drawee_; and the person to be paid, the _payee_.\r\n\r\nNegotiability.--The payee in any of these cases may wish to transfer the\r\npaper to some other person. For instance, the holder of the note may wish\r\nto use the money before it is due, or the payee of a draft may wish to\r\nrealize without going to the drawee. In either case, the desired\r\naccommodation can be secured only by selling the paper to some one else.\r\nThis ability to be transferred is part of what is meant by the term\r\n_negotiability_.\r\n\r\nBut this liability to have to pay another person than the one named,\r\ncannot be imposed upon the maker or drawer without his consent. This he\r\ngives by inserting after the name of the payee the words \"or order,\" or\r\nthe words \"or bearer.\" In the latter case, whoever holds the paper when it\r\nbecomes due can collect upon it. In case the former words are used, the\r\npaper can be transferred only by _indorsement_, of which more anon.\r\n\r\nA very important characteristic of negotiability is that it enables a\r\nperson to grant to another rights which he may not himself possess. To\r\nillustrate: As between the maker and the payee, a note is a contract, and\r\nis binding only if it has all the requisites of a binding contract.\r\nTherefore, if there was no consideration, or if the note was obtained by\r\nfraud or by intimidation, the payee, knowing these facts, has no right to\r\ncollect upon the note, and he could not by law compel payment. But with a\r\nthird party it is different. He sees only the note, and may not--\r\npresumably does not--know anything else about the contract. To compel him\r\nbefore buying the note to learn all the details of its history, might be\r\nembarrassing to the parties, even where everything is all right, and would\r\ncertainly delay, perhaps materially, the transfer. Therefore, to enable\r\npeople to keep their business to themselves, and to facilitate transfers\r\nof commercial paper, it has seemed best not to require this investigation.\r\nThe law presumes that when a person makes a transferable note, he has done\r\nso deliberately; and if loss ensues, it says that he must bear it rather\r\nthan the innocent purchaser of his note.\r\n\r\nConditions of Negotiability.--But this peculiar protection is given, be it\r\nobserved, only to an _innocent purchaser_. If in good faith, in the\r\nregular course of business, a person comes into possession of commercial\r\npaper, negotiable in form, not yet mature, and for which he has given a\r\nreasonable consideration, he can collect on it. On the other hand, if he\r\nhas found the paper or stolen it, or if he has bought it under\r\ncircumstances calculated to raise a suspicion as to right of the seller,\r\nhe should not have, and will not by law receive, this privilege. Thus if a\r\nman is offered commercial paper of perfectly responsible parties at\r\none-third its value, it would be reasonable to suppose that the person\r\noffering it had found or stolen it, and the buyer would obtain only the\r\nrights of the person from whom he bought. Or if a note past due is offered\r\nfor sale, the presumption is that it is paid or that it is for some reason\r\nuncollectable, and the purchaser would buy at his peril. In other words,\r\n_if there is anything on the face of the paper or in the circumstances of\r\nthe case to warn the purchaser, he buys at his own risk_, and secures only\r\nsuch rights as the vendor has.\r\n\r\nTransfer.--Negotiable paper with the words \"or bearer\" is transferable by\r\ndelivery alone. If made payable to some person \"or order,\" it is\r\ntransferable only by his _indorsement_. An \"indorsement in full\" consists\r\nof the signature of the payee and his order that the money be paid to a\r\nspecified person. An \"indorsement in blank\" consists simply of the\r\nsignature of the payee. The effect of the latter mode of indorsing is to\r\nmake the paper payable to bearer.\r\n\r\nResponsibility of Maker.--A note being a contract, the maker of one is\r\nresponsible to the payee, as has been said, only if all the requisites of\r\na binding contract are present. If the note is negotiable in form, he is\r\nresponsible to the innocent purchaser of it.\r\n\r\nResponsibility of Drawee.--The person drawn upon may know nothing of the\r\ndraft. He cannot be made a party to a contract without his knowledge and\r\nconsent. That he may have knowledge of the draft, it must be presented to\r\nhim. If upon seeing it he is willing to assume the responsibility of\r\npaying it when due, he signifies his willingness by writing across the\r\nface of the draft the word \"accepted,\" with the date of presentation and\r\nhis name. The draft thereby becomes his unconditional promise, and he\r\nbecomes the principal debtor, occupying the position of a maker of a note.\r\n\r\nResponsibility of Indorser.--When a person endorses any commercial paper,\r\nhe not only expresses thereby his consent to the transfer of it, but he\r\nalso enters into a conditional contract with each person who may afterward\r\ncome into possession of the paper, whereby he becomes responsible for its\r\npayment, if the principal debtor fails to meet his obligation. To fix\r\nresponsibility upon an indorser, payment must be demanded of the principal\r\ndebtor on the very day when the obligation matures, and if payment is not\r\nmade notice of the fact must be sent to the indorser before the end of the\r\nfollowing day.\r\n\r\nResponsibility of Drawer.--Between the drawer and the payee a draft is a\r\nconditional contract, whereby the former impliedly agrees to pay the draft\r\nif the person drawn upon does not. His obligation is that of a surety or\r\nfirst indorser. To fix responsibility upon the drawer, the holder of the\r\ndraft must promptly present it for acceptance to the person drawn upon;\r\nthen, if it is not accepted, he must immediately notify the drawer.\r\n\r\nForged Paper.--Forgery is the fraudulent making or altering of a written\r\ninstrument. One whose name is forged cannot be made responsible, since the\r\nact is not his. And since money paid under a mistake must be refunded, a\r\nperson who, deceived by the skill of the forger, should pay the seeming\r\nobligation, would be entitled to get his money back.\r\n\r\nBut every person is bound to use reasonable effort to prevent forgery.\r\nThus, if a merchant writes out a note all but the amount, and authorizes a\r\nclerk to put that in at some other time, and the clerk inserts a larger\r\nsum, any innocent purchaser can compel the merchant to pay the full\r\namount. In some states it is held that a person who leaves space in an\r\nobligation wherein the amount can readily be raised, is bound to stand the\r\nloss caused by his negligence.\r\n\r\nAccommodation Paper.--A man may be perfectly willing to lend a friend some\r\nmoney and yet be unable to do so. He may, however, in any one of several\r\nways, make it possible for his friend to obtain the money. Thus A, wishing\r\nto accommodate his friend B, may make a note payable to B's order; or he\r\nmay endorse B's note; or he may make a draft payable to B's order; or he\r\nmay accept B's draft on him. By selling the paper, B secures the money\r\ndesired. The implied contract between A and B is that B will pay the\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\nIn none of these cases could B compel A to pay him any money, because the\r\ncontract between them lacks consideration. But A would be responsible to\r\nan innocent purchaser, because there is nothing on the face of the paper\r\nto indicate the defect. And he would be responsible even to a purchaser\r\nwho knows the paper to be accommodation, because by signing he binds\r\nhimself to pay if B does not, and his signature is what enables the sale\r\nto be made.\r\n\r\nCertified Checks.--Business men make most of their payments by check. If\r\nthe receiver of a check does not, for any reason, wish the money, he may\r\ndeposit the check in the bank as if it were cash. If he is going away from\r\nhome, or if he wishes to make a payment in some other place, he may save\r\nthe expense of a draft, and make a check equally as acceptable, by getting\r\nthe cashier of the bank to \"certify\" it, that is to state officially that\r\nthe drawer has the money in the bank. This he does by writing across the\r\nface of the draft the word \"Good,\" with his signature as cashier. When\r\nthis is done the responsibility rests primarily on the bank. It occupies\r\nthe position of the acceptor of a draft.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pertinent Questions._\r\n\r\nTwo of the following are valid notes; which two? The others are not; Why?\r\n1. March 5, 1890, I promise to pay John Smith one hundred dollars, if he\r\nis then living.--William Jones. 2. On or before March 5, 1890, I promise\r\nto pay John Smith one hundred bushels of wheat.--William Jones. 3. On\r\nMarch 5, 1890, I promise to pay John Smith whatever is then due him.--\r\nWilliam Jones. 4. When he comes of age, I promise to pay John Smith one\r\nhundred dollars.--William Jones. 5.

Mankato, Minn.,\r\nDecember 11, 1888. One year after date I promise to pay John Smith one\r\nhundred dollars. 8. On the death of his father, I promise to pay John\r\nSmith one hundred dollars.--William Jones. 9. On March 5, 1890, I, William\r\nJones, promise to pay John Smith one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nHow many parties may there be to a note? How many, at least, must there\r\nbe? As between them, must there be consideration to make it binding? Must\r\nthe words \"for value received\" appear on the note? A note being a\r\ncontract, what things are necessary to make it binding?

Which imposes the less responsibility if transferred?\r\nIf you were taking a note payable to bearer, would you require the person\r\nfrom whom you were getting it to indorse it? A man has some non-negotiable\r\nnotes; if he dies can his heir collect them? A note payable \"to order\" is\r\nindorsed in blank; to whom is it payable? May a note payable \"to bearer\"\r\nbe made payable only \"to order?\" When does a note cease to be negotiable?\r\nUnder what circumstances may a person have to pay a note which he has\r\nalready paid? What is a \"greenback?\"\r\n\r\nHow many persons, at least, must there be to an accepted draft? When does\r\nthe responsibility of the drawer begin? That of the person drawn upon? How\r\ndoes the acceptance of a draft affect the responsibility of the drawer? If\r\nthe draft is not accepted, to whom shall the holder look for pay? Are\r\ndrafts negotiable before acceptance?\r\n\r\nCompare and contrast a note and a draft. A draft and a check. Is the bank\r\nunder any obligation to the holder of an uncertified check? Does\r\ncertifying a check release the drawer of it? Are checks negotiable?\r\n\r\nWhat responsibility does an indorser assume in case of a note? Of an\r\nunaccepted draft? Of an accepted draft? Of a check? What does \"without\r\nrecourse\" mean? To how many persons is the maker of a note responsible?\r\nThe first indorser? The second? How can the first indorser be\r\ndistinguished from the second? To whom is the second indorser not\r\nresponsible?\r\n\r\nWho are not responsible to the holder of a negotiable paper unless\r\nnotified? Who are responsible without notice? What principle do you\r\ndiscover? When is a demand note due? A check? A time note? A sight draft?\r\nA time draft?\r\n\r\nWhat should you do, and why, in the following cases:\r\n\r\n1. When you pay a note? 2. When you make a partial payment on a note? 3.\r\nIf you should lose a note? 4. If you have a note without indorsees, to\r\nrender the maker responsible? 5.

There are also ten\r\nappointments at large, specially conferred by the President of the United\r\nStates. The number of students is thus limited to three hundred and\r\nseventy-one.\r\n\r\nAppointments are usually made one year in advance of date of admission, by\r\nthe Secretary of War, upon the nomination of the Representative. These\r\nnominations may either be made after competitive examinations or given\r\ndirect, at the option of the Representative. Appointees to the Military\r\nAcademy must be between seventeen and twenty-two years of age, free from\r\nany infirmity which may render them unfit for military service, and able\r\nto pass a careful examination in reading, writing, orthography,\r\narithmetic, grammar, geography, and history of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction, which is quite thorough, requires four years,\r\nand is largely mathematical and professional. About one-fourth of those\r\nappointed usually fail to pass the preliminary examination, and but little\r\nover one-half the remainder are finally graduated. The discipline is very\r\nstrict--even more so than in the army--and the enforcement of penalties\r\nfor offences is inflexible rather than severe. Academic duties begin\r\nSeptember 1 and continue until June 1. Examinations are held in each\r\nJanuary and June.\r\n\r\nFrom about the middle of June to the end of August cadets live in camp,\r\nengaged only in military duties and receiving practical military\r\ninstruction. Cadets are allowed but one leave of absence during the four\r\nyears' course, and this is granted at the expiration of the first two\r\nyears. The pay of a cadet is five hundred and forty dollars per year. Upon\r\ngraduating, cadets are commissioned as second lieutenants in the United\r\nStates Army.\r\n\r\nThe Academy was established by act of Congress in 1802. An annual Board of\r\nVisitors is appointed, seven being appointed by the President of the\r\nUnited States, two by the President of the Senate, and three by the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives. They visit the Academy in June,\r\nand are present at the concluding exercises of the graduating class of\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES NAVAL ACADEMY AT ANNAPOLIS.\r\n\r\nThere are allowed at the Academy one naval cadet for each Member or\r\nDelegate of the United States House of Representatives, one for the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, and ten at large. The appointment of cadets at large\r\nand for the District of Columbia is made by the President. The Secretary\r\nof the Navy, as soon after March 5 in each year as possible, must notify\r\nin writing each Member and Delegate of the House of Representatives of any\r\nvacancy that may exist in his district. The nomination of a candidate to\r\nfill the vacancy is made, on the recommendation of the Member or Delegate,\r\nby the Secretary. Candidates must be actual residents of the districts\r\nfrom which they are nominated.\r\n\r\nThe course of naval cadets is six years, the last two of which are spent\r\nat sea. Candidates at the time of their examination for admission must be\r\nnot under fifteen nor over twenty years of age, and physically sound, well\r\nformed, and of robust condition. They enter the Academy immediately after\r\npassing the prescribed examinations, and are required to sign articles\r\nbinding themselves to serve in the United States Navy eight years\r\n(including the time of probation at the Naval Academy), unless sooner\r\ndischarged. The pay of a naval cadet is five hundred dollars a year,\r\nbeginning at the date of admission.\r\n\r\nAt least ten appointments from among the graduates are made each year.\r\nSurplus graduates who do not receive appointments are given a certificate\r\nof graduation, an honorable discharge, and one year's sea pay.\r\n\r\nThe Academy was founded in 1845 by the Hon. George Bancroft, Secretary of\r\nthe Navy in the administration of President Polk. It was formally opened\r\nOctober 10 of that year, with Commander Franklin Buchanan as\r\nSuperintendent. During the Civil War it was removed from Annapolis, Md.,\r\nto Newport, R.I., but was returned to the former place in 1865. It is\r\nunder the direct supervision of the Bureau of Navigation, Navy Department.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS FOR EACH DECADE WITH RATIOS.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: This table went

They are spoken of as direct and indirect,\r\nthe former being paid as taxes, the latter as part of the price of a\r\ncommodity.\r\n\r\nWithin the State.--Local and state taxes are all direct. They are meant to\r\nbe proportioned to a person's ability to pay. In fact, however, a person's\r\ntax is based upon the value of his _discoverable property_. The value of\r\nsuch property is estimated by local officers called assessors. The\r\nestimates of these officers are reviewed by the local board, and the\r\nreviewed estimates are again examined and equalized by the county board.\r\nBut assessors, local boards, and county boards are all tempted to make the\r\nestimates low, to reduce their share of taxation for the use of the state.\r\nSo a final review is made by the state board of equalization. The final\r\nestimates being reported to the computing officer, and the various sums to\r\nbe raised having been reported to him, he finds the _rate_ of taxation,\r\ncomputes the taxes, and turns the books over to the collecting officer.\r\n\r\nCertain classes of property are exempt from taxation. Among those usually\r\nexempt may be mentioned property owned by the United States, the state, or\r\nthe municipal corporation; church property; educational and charitable\r\ninstitutions; and a certain amount of personal property. United States\r\nbonds cannot be taxed.\r\n\r\nBy the General Government.--The sources of revenue to the general\r\ngovernment are: 1, customs; 2, excises; 3, direct taxes; 4, public lands;\r\n5, receipts from post offices, patents, copyrights, fines, escheats, &c.\r\nThe last two classes cannot be called taxes. As it cannot compel a state\r\nto collect taxes for it, the general government is practically barred, on\r\naccount of expense, from laying direct taxes. So that it is practically\r\ntrue that national taxation is all indirect. The \"customs\" are duties on\r\nimports. The \"excises,\" or internal revenue, consist of taxes on tobacco,\r\nfermented and alcoholic liquors, &c.\r\n\r\nA Difficult Problem.--Though taxes have been levied for untold centuries,\r\nit is still one of the unsolved problems how to levy them so as to be just\r\nto all. Much progress has been made, but entirely satisfactory answers\r\nhave not yet been wrought out to the questions: What are the proper things\r\nto tax? For what purposes should taxes be levied?\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE GOVERNMENT BORROWS.\r\n\r\nWhen an individual wishes to borrow money, he looks around for some one\r\nwho has the money to spare and who has confidence enough in him to let him\r\nhave it. He gives his note or bond, and gets the money. Similarly the\r\nUnited States borrows. The secretary of the treasury looks for lenders in\r\nthe money-centers of the world, consults great banking-houses, and\r\nsometimes advertises in newspapers.\r\n\r\nA private borrower pays for the use of the money, and similarly the debt\r\nof the United States is largely interest-bearing. The notes called\r\n\"greenbacks\" bear no interest, because, being legal tender, they circulate\r\nas money, as do also the gold and silver certificates of deposit.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW NATIONAL BANKS ARE ESTABLISHED.\r\n\r\nOrganization.--Associations for carrying on the business of banking may be\r\nformed by any number of natural persons not less than five. A signed and\r\ncertified copy of the articles of association is forwarded to the\r\ncomptroller of the currency; also a certificate giving the name of the\r\nassociation, its place of business, its capital, the number of shares and\r\ntheir owners.\r\n\r\nCapital.--The minimum capital required is: in cities of less than 6000\r\ninhabitants, $50,000; less than 50,000 inhabitants, $100,000; others,\r\n$200,000.\r\n\r\nPowers.--Such associations have the usual corporate and banking powers. In\r\naddition, they may issue their notes to circulate as currency on the\r\nfollowing conditions: Upon depositing with the U. S. Treasurer registered\r\nbonds of the United States, to an amount not less than $30,000 nor less\r\nthan one-third of its capital, the bank receives from the comptroller of\r\nthe currency blank notes of face value not to exceed ninety per cent of\r\nthe par value of the bonds. These notes, after being signed by the\r\npresident and the cashier of the bank, may circulate as money, but are not\r\nlegal tender for private debts.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO OBTAIN A COPYRIGHT.\r\n\r\n[By A. R. Spofford, Librarian of Congress]\r\n\r\nEvery applicant for a copyright must state distinctly the name and\r\nresidence of the claimant, and whether right is claimed as author,\r\ndesigner, or proprietor. No affidavit or formal application is required.\r\n\r\nA printed copy of the title of the book, map, chart, dramatic or musical\r\ncomposition, engraving, cut, print, or photograph, or a description of the\r\npainting, drawing, chromo, statue, statuary, or model or design for a work\r\nof the fine arts, for which copyright is desired, must be sent by mail or\r\notherwise, prepaid, addressed, \"Librarian of Congress, Washington, D.C.\"\r\nThis must be done before publication of the book or other article.\r\n\r\nA fee of 50 cents, for recording the title of each book or other article,\r\nmust be inclosed with the title as above, and 50 cents in addition (or one\r\ndollar in all) for each certificate of copyright under seal of the\r\nLibrarian of Congress, which will be transmitted by early mail.\r\n\r\nWithin ten days after publication of each book or other article, two\r\ncomplete copies must be sent prepaid, or under free labels, furnished by\r\nthe Librarian, to perfect the copyright, with the address, \"Librarian of\r\nCongress, Washington, D.C.\"\r\n\r\nNo copyright is valid unless notice is given by inserting in every copy\r\npublished, \"Entered according to the act of Congress, in the year ----, by\r\n----, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington,\" or, at\r\nthe option of the person entering the copyright, the words \"Copyright,\r\n18--, by ----.\"\r\n\r\nThe law imposes a penalty of $1*0 [Transcriber's Note: Illegible] upon any\r\nperson who has not obtained copyright who shall insert the notice \"Entered\r\naccording to act of Congress,\" or \"Copyright,\" or words of the same\r\nimport, in or upon any book or other article.\r\n\r\nEach copyright secures the exclusive right of publishing the book or\r\narticle copyrighted for the term of twenty-eight years. Six months before\r\nthe end of that time, the author or designer, or his widow or children,\r\nmay secure a renewal for the further term of fourteen years, making\r\nforty-two years in all.\r\n\r\nAny copyright is assignable in law by any instrument of writing, but such\r\nassignment must be recorded in the office of the Librarian of Congress\r\nwithin sixty days from its date. The fee for this record and certificate\r\nis one dollar.\r\n\r\nA copy of the record (or duplicate certificate) of any copyright entry\r\nwill be furnished, under seal, at the rate of fifty cents.\r\n\r\nCopyrights cannot be granted upon Trade-marks, nor upon Labels intended to\r\nbe used with any article of manufacture. If protection for such prints or\r\nlabels is desired, application must be made to the Patent Office, where\r\nthey are registered at a fee of $6 for labels and $25 for trade-marks.\r\n\r\nUp to 1849 the secretary of state had the care of issuing copyrights. It\r\nwas then assigned to the department of the interior, newly created. In\r\n1870 it was transferred to the librarian of congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO OBTAIN A PATENT.\r\n\r\n1. The person desiring a patent must declare upon oath that he believes\r\nhimself to be the inventor or discoverer of the art, machine, or\r\nimprovement for which he solicits the patent.\r\n\r\n2. He must also give in writing a definite and minute description of it,\r\naccompanied by drawings to illustrate. If necessary, he must make and\r\ndeliver to the commissioner of patents a model of his invention.\r\n\r\nTo be patentable, the invention must be new, unused and unknown before,\r\nand useful.\r\n\r\nThe invention is carefully examined by the appropriate expert at the\r\npatent office, and if found to be deserving a patent is issued, signed by\r\nthe secretary of the interior, countersigned by the commissioner of\r\npatents, and sealed with his seal. This gives the patentee the sole right\r\nof manufacture and sale and use for seventeen years. The right to make,\r\nsell, or use the invention may be sold by the patentee. He may assign the\r\npatent entire, an interest in it, or the exclusive right for a certain\r\nspecified district.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW AN ALIEN BECOMES A CITIZEN.\r\n\r\n1. Declaration of Intention.--An alien, who has come to the United States\r\nafter reaching the age of eighteen, may appear before any court of record\r\nin the United States having common law jurisdiction, or the clerk thereof,\r\nand declare upon oath that it is _bona fide_ his intention to become a\r\ncitizen of the United States, and to renounce forever \"all allegiance to\r\nany foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty whatever,\" and\r\nparticularly by name the potentate or sovereignty whereof such alien may\r\nat any time have been a citizen or subject. This declaration is recorded,\r\nand a certified copy of it is furnished by the clerk of the court to the\r\nperson so declaring his intention. He is then said to have his \"first\r\npapers.\" See page 290. 2. The Final Step.--After two years from the time\r\nof declaring his intention, provided that he has resided in the United\r\nStates continuously for five years, and also at least one year within the\r\nstate or territory wherein the court is held, he may appear in open court\r\nand there upon oath renounce all allegiance, as declared in his statement\r\nof intention, and swear to support the constitution of the United States.\r\nIf he has borne any hereditary title, he must renounce it. He must have\r\ntwo witnesses to certify to his residence and to his moral character.\r\nThese proceedings are recorded, and he is given a certificate of\r\nnaturalization. See page 201.\r\n\r\nAn alien arriving in the United States before reaching the age of eighteen\r\nand continuously residing therein until making his application for\r\ncitizenship, provided that he has resided in the United States five years,\r\nmay on coming of age be admitted to citizenship at once, without the\r\ninterval between the declaration and the consummation. He must, however,\r\nmake declaration, must prove his moral character by two witnesses, and\r\nmust satisfy the court that for three years it has been _bona fide_ his\r\nintention to become a citizen of the United States.\r\n\r\nStatus of Minors.--The naturalization of a man confers citizenship upon\r\nhis wife and upon such of his children as are minors at the time. A child\r\nof his born in this country, either before or after his naturalization, is\r\na \"natural-born\" citizen. This is also the case if the child is born on\r\nthe ocean while the parents are coming to this country, provided that they\r\nare coming with the intention of seeking citizenship. If an alien dies\r\nafter declaring his intention, his wife and minor children may become\r\ncitizens upon taking the oath required.\r\n\r\nLosing Citizenship.--By treaties with Austria, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium,\r\nGreat Britain, Germany, the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Mexico, Norway and\r\nSweden, Denmark, and Wurtemberg, it is provided that \"a renewal of\r\ndomicile in the mother country, with the intent not to return (and two\r\nyears residence is presumptive evidence of such intent), shall work\r\nrenewal of the former allegiance.\"\r\n\r\nIn some of the treaties it is further provided that when the subject has\r\nemigrated to avoid military duty, \"the right to exact which was complete\r\nbefore his departure, such service may be enforced on his return in spite\r\nof intervening naturalization.\" (See also U.S. Revised Statutes of 1878,\r\n§§ 2165-74.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW CITIZENS ABROAD ARE PROTECTED.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that makes citizenship desirable is the protection which\r\nit secures. This is particularly grateful when one is in a foreign\r\ncountry. What a feeling of strength and security one has when far away\r\nfrom home among strangers to know that his rights must be respected, to\r\nrealize that behind him is the might of the nation!\r\n\r\nPassports.--A United States passport is an instrument in writing, issued\r\nby the secretary of state and under his seal, informing the world that the\r\nbearer is a citizen of the United States, that he travels under its\r\nprotection. That passport is a means of identification for the bearer and\r\nsecures to him all the rights and privileges guaranteed to citizens of the\r\nUnited States by treaties with the country in which he may be traveling.\r\n\r\nPassports, as a means of ingress or egress, are now required in only a few\r\ncountries of Europe. For the convenience of citizens who may have left\r\nhome without securing passports, arrangements have been made whereby they\r\nmay be obtained from our representatives in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of passport is that for American ships. Each ship-master\r\nobtains one before leaving for a foreign port. It tells the nationality of\r\nthe ship, shows that she is under the protection of the United States.\r\n\r\nConsuls.--These are the business representatives of the government\r\nresiding in foreign lands. They are \"the guardians of their countrymen\r\nagainst the vexations, injuries, and injustices of the country where they\r\nreside; and they exercise certain police powers over all the individuals\r\nof their nation\" within their respective consulates.\r\n\r\nThe origin of consulates dates back to the time of the Crusades. They were\r\ninstituted by the great commercial cities of the Mediterranean. The\r\nPisans, Venetians, and Genoese had trading-places in various parts of\r\nAsia, and they secured from the princes of the countries where these\r\ntrading-posts were located the right to have judges or arbitrators of\r\ntheir own nation located at each of these posts who were privileged to\r\nsettle disputes between citizens of these cities in accordance with their\r\nown laws. At first, then, the consuls were only arbitrators in commercial\r\nmatters. But their prerogatives have increased until now they are\r\nintrusted with the protection of merchants of their country in their\r\nrelations with the countries to which they come to trade.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, such as China, Japan, Siam, and Turkey, our consuls are\r\nby treaty invested with judicial powers. They try and punish American\r\ncitizens for crimes committed there.\r\n\r\nIncidentally it is the duty of a consul to provide for sick, disabled or\r\ndestitute American seamen, and to send them home to the United States; to\r\nreceive and take care of the personal property of any American citizen who\r\ndies within his consulate, and to forward to the secretary of state the\r\nbalance remaining after the necessary funeral expenses, to be held in\r\ntrust for the heirs. (See also page 350.)\r\n\r\nSome of the consular reports contain very valuable information regarding\r\nthe products and industries of the countries where they are located. These\r\nreports can sometimes be obtained in limited numbers through a member of\r\ncongress.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WE ARE PROTECTED AT HOME.\r\n\r\nLife.--Our lives are protected very carefully, not only against crime, but\r\nalso against accident. Taking human life is made the worst crime and\r\nsuffers the severest punishment. Death-dealing weapons, such as revolvers\r\nand dirks, cannot lawfully be carried concealed. Poisons are cautiously\r\nsold, and usually a record is made of the sale. If death results from\r\naccident the person to blame is held responsible. But every precaution is\r\ntaken to prevent accidents. Lamps are provided for streets; fast driving\r\nis prohibited; horses are not allowed to be left standing unhitched;\r\nbusiness dangerous to life, such as powder-making, must be carried on at a\r\ndistance from residences; railroads are required to stop trains at\r\ncrossings, to ring a bell in going through a town, to carry axes and\r\nbuckets to be used in case of fire; steamboats must be inspected, and must\r\nbe supplied with life-boats, life-preservers, and other appliances.\r\n\r\nHealth.--To protect our health precautions are taken against the outbreak\r\nof preventable diseases, such as diphtheria, typhoid fever, etc., by\r\nrequiring cleanliness in yards and alleys; and against small pox by\r\nrequiring vaccination. The government also supports hospitals for the care\r\nof the sick.\r\n\r\nReputation.--To secure to each person as good a reputation as his\r\ncharacter will warrant it is made a crime to make false and malicious\r\nstatements about any one. If spoken, the malicious statement is called\r\nslander; if written or printed, it is called libel. The essential elements\r\nof these crimes are malice and injury. If a false statement is made\r\nwithout intent to injure, it is not slander. And a true statement injuring\r\nanother must not be made except for a proper purpose.\r\n\r\nLiberty.--This includes all those rights guaranteed in the Bills of Rights\r\nof the several constitutions, and the right to come and go without\r\nrestraint, the right to choose a vocation and to change it, and other\r\nrights. To appreciate the protection received in this direction, the\r\nstudent should read up the history of each of the guarantees, and of\r\ncaste, curfew, passports, etc.\r\n\r\nProperty.--\"The right of private property covers the acquiring, using, and\r\ndisposing of anything that a person may call his own, including time and\r\nlabor.\" A person's property rights may be interfered with in so many ways\r\nthat many laws are necessary to protect him. A brief outline of commercial\r\nlaw is given elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ELECTIONS ARE CONDUCTED.\r\n\r\nElectors.--The voters of each state are designated by the constitution\r\nthereof. See page 298.\r\n\r\nTime.--The time of elections is usually also a matter of constitutional\r\nprovision. The local (town, village, and city) elections are, in most if\r\nnot all of the states, held in the spring; probably because the public\r\nimprovements contemplated are to be made chiefly in the summer. The\r\ngeneral elections are held in the fall. This may be partly at least, in\r\norder that the official year may begin with the calendar year.\r\n\r\nPlace.--Towns, villages, and city wards are the usual election precincts,\r\nbut any of these may be divided if necessary. The location of the\r\npolling-place is determined by the convenience of the voters.\r\n\r\nSupervision.--Each polling-place is in charge of supervisors of election,\r\nusually three. In towns and villages, the regular trustees supervise the\r\nelections. In cities, three persons for each precinct are appointed to act\r\nby the council or by the mayor. The supervisors are assisted by one or two\r\nclerks.\r\n\r\nRegistration.--To prevent fraud, it is required that a person shall have\r\nbeen a resident of the precinct in which he offers to vote for at least\r\nten days. In the cities, where population fluctuates greatly, it has been\r\nfound necessary to require voters to register before the day of election;\r\nthat is, to enroll their names and places of residence with the officers\r\nof election.\r\n\r\nNotices.--Due notice of the times and places of registration and election\r\nis given, at least ten days in advance.\r\n\r\nVoting.--This is by ballot, the two chief reasons being, (_a_) to permit\r\nthe voter to express his choice uninfluenced by any one else; (_b_) to\r\nfacilitate the voting.\r\n\r\nThe voter hands to the chairman of the supervisors his ballot, folded so\r\nas to conceal the names. After ascertaining from the other supervisors\r\nthat the name of the person offering the vote is registered, or being\r\nsatisfied in some other way that he is entitled to vote, the chairman, in\r\nthe presence of the voter, deposits the ballot in the box. The voter's\r\nname is then checked on the register, and enrolled by the clerks on the\r\n\"list of persons who have voted.\"\r\n\r\nCounting.--Each name as it is written by the clerks is numbered, and the\r\nsupervisors in checking the register do so by writing the number of the\r\nvote. At the close of the polls, therefore, the number of persons who have\r\nvoted is known. The ballots are then turned out of the box upon a table,\r\nand, without being unfolded, are carefully counted, to see whether they\r\ncorrespond in number with the records. If, as once in a while happens, it\r\nis found that there are too many ballots, those in excess are drawn\r\nhap-hazard from the pile by the supervisors and destroyed. The ballots are\r\nthen unfolded, and the count of the persons voted for is carefully made\r\nand recorded. These proceedings are all open to the public.\r\n\r\nReporting.--In local elections, the result of the vote is read by a clerk\r\nto those present. An abstract of the vote is filed in the office of the\r\nclerk of the corporation, and a list of the persons elected is sent to the\r\nauditor (clerk) of the county. The names of the justices of the peace and\r\nthe constables are reported to the clerk of the court.\r\n\r\nIn general elections, the abstract of the vote is sent to the county\r\nauditor. He makes a general abstract of the vote of the county on state\r\nofficers, members of congress, and presidential electors, and sends it to\r\nthe state auditor. He also sends to the same officer a list of the persons\r\nelected to county offices. An abstract of the vote is published in one or\r\nmore of the county papers.\r\n\r\nCanvassing Boards.--The persons composing these boards are designated by\r\nstatute. The secretary of the organization is always a member. He is\r\nusually assisted by two or more judicial officers.\r\n\r\nCertificates of Election.--These are furnished to officers-elect by the\r\nsecretary of the organization. Certificates of members of congress and\r\npresidential electors are signed by the governor and the secretary of\r\nstate, and are authenticated by the state seal.\r\n\r\nDefects.--With all the thought that has been given to the subject, it is\r\nstill an unsolved problem how to secure \"a free vote and a fair count.\" Of\r\nthe two purposes given above to be subserved by the use of the ballot\r\nrather than by _viva voce_ voting, the first is too commonly not realized.\r\nPerhaps the greatest danger to our government is bribery or overawing of\r\nthe voter.\r\n\r\nA remedy suggested.--The main reliance for the purity of the ballot must\r\nof course be the intelligence and uprightness of the people, and he who\r\nenlightens and uplifts one or more individuals is to that extent truly a\r\npatriot.\r\n\r\nThe second reliance is the removal of temptation. There may be \"honor\r\namong thieves,\" but wrong doing makes a person suspicious, and if the\r\nbriber cannot see the bribed deposit his ballot he has no good reason for\r\nbelieving that he did as directed.\r\n\r\nIn Australia they have a plan which seems to obviate bribery, and to have\r\ncertain other incidental advantages. The plan includes two main features:\r\n1. The printing of ballots at state expense, the ballots to contain all\r\nthe nominees of all the parties and appropriate blank spaces for the\r\ninsertion of other names; 2. The secret preparation of the ballot by the\r\nvoter and his casting it in the presence of the officers only. The\r\noperation of the plan slightly modified, as now proposed in Massachusetts,\r\nis briefly this: In the polling room as now, is the ballot-box; this none\r\nbut those in the act of voting and the officers are allowed to approach.\r\nAs the voters enter the enclosed area a stile numbers them, and an officer\r\nhands each a ballot, containing the names of all nominees. The voter takes\r\nthis into a booth, and makes a cross in ink opposite the name of each\r\nperson that he wishes to vote for. Having thus prepared his ballot alone,\r\nhe deposits it in the usual way.\r\n\r\nThe advantages promised by this plan are obvious. The printing of the\r\nballots at state expense would do away with one of the pretexts for\r\nbleeding a candidate for \"legitimate expenses.\" It would take their\r\noccupation from the ticket-peddlers, and do away with the deceiving\r\n\"pasters.\" The electors would be freed from the nuisance of personal\r\nsolicitation or dictation. The polling-places would be quieter and more\r\norderly. Best of all, it would greatly minify the evils of bribery for\r\nreasons given above.\r\n\r\nThe principle is certainly a good one, and the machinery is worthy of the\r\ncareful consideration of our legislators.\r\n\r\nLater: This system is now used in several states.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY AND HOW NOMINATIONS ARE MADE.\r\n\r\nA political party may be defined as a number of persons holding similar\r\nviews in relation to one or more questions of public policy, and who\r\nthrough unity of action seek to have these views prevail.\r\n\r\nThe great instrument for securing unity is the convention. It may be a\r\nmass meeting, or, as is more usual among the large and well-organized\r\nparties, a convention of delegates. In either case it is, be it\r\nremembered, not a part of the elective machinery designed by the\r\nlegislature, but a political device to increase the chances of victory\r\nthrough unity of purpose and action.\r\n\r\nParty organization consists of \"committees\"--town, village, city-ward,\r\ncounty, state, and national. The local committees are chosen by the\r\nresident partisans; the county committees by the county conventions; the\r\nstate committees by state conventions; and the national committee,\r\nconsisting usually of one member from each state, by the delegates of the\r\nrespective states to the national convention. Each committee chooses its\r\nown chairman and secretary. Besides those mentioned, there are district\r\ncommittees, such as congressional-district committees, senate-district\r\ncommittees, etc., whose members are appointed in a manner similar to that\r\ngiven above. The term of a member is, as might be expected, from the close\r\nof one regular convention to the close of the succeeding one.  Thus a town\r\ncommitteeman's term is one year, while that of a national committeeman is\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nThe mode of nominating a candidate for the presidency of the United States\r\nwill illustrate the way of making nominations in general.\r\n\r\n1. By long-established practice, each state is entitled to twice as many\r\ndelegates to the national convention as the number of its presidential\r\nelectors, and each territory to two delegates. Thus, Minnesota being\r\nentitled to nine electors, may send eighteen delegates: and New York,\r\nhaving thirty-six electors, is entitled to seventy-two delegates. Each\r\ndelegate has an alternate, who acts in the delegate's absence.\r\n\r\n2. Though the popular election does not take place until November, the\r\nnational conventions are usually held in June or July. This is probably to\r\nallow plenty of time for the campaign.\r\n\r\n3. To allow the machinery time to grind out the delegates, the national\r\ncommittee, having early determined upon the time and place for holding the\r\nconvention, issues its \"call\" some months in advance, say in February or\r\nMarch. This is published in the newspapers throughout the country.\r\n\r\n4. The next step in the process is the issuance of calls by the several\r\nstate committees. These are issued as soon as practicable after that of\r\nthe national committee, and usually appoint the state convention for the\r\nlatter part of May.\r\n\r\n5. In some states all of the delegates to the national convention are\r\nchosen by the state convention. But the number of states is increasing,\r\nand properly so, in which each congressional district chooses its own two\r\ndelegates, leaving only the four \"delegates at large\" to be chosen by the\r\nstate convention. In these states, the next step is the call of the\r\ndistrict committee for a convention slightly antedating that of the state.\r\n\r\n6. As soon as practicable after the district call is announced, the\r\nseveral county committees issue their call for county conventions, to be\r\nheld shortly before the district convention.\r\n\r\n7. Lastly, the local committees issue their calls, usually giving a week\r\nor ten days' notice. The local convention is called a \"caucus.\"\r\n\r\n8. Then in succession the local, county, district, state, and national\r\nconventions are held. The caucuses send representatives to the county\r\nconventions, which in turn choose the deputations to the district and\r\nstate conventions, and these finally select the delegates to the national\r\nconvention. An equal number of \"alternates\" are chosen at the same time.\r\nThe state convention also names the presidential electors to be supported\r\nby the party.\r\n\r\nThus the national convention is the first to be called and the last to be\r\nheld, while the caucuses are the last to be called and the first to be\r\nheld. The caucuses are the real battling-place for the people.\r\n\r\nThe delegates from each convention receive certificates of election signed\r\nby the chairman and secretary thereof. These \"credentials\" are given to\r\nprevent fraud, and constitute the delegates' title to seats in the\r\nconvention to which they are sent.\r\n\r\nThe first step taken in the national convention, after securing a\r\n\"temporary organization,\" is the appointment of a committee on credentials\r\nand another on permanent organization, by the temporary chairman. When the\r\nformer committee reports, it is known who are entitled to participate in\r\nthe proceedings; and when the latter committee reports, the convention\r\nalmost invariably adopts the report and thereby perfects its organization.\r\nA committee on rules and one on platform are then appointed.\r\n\r\nThe states are then called in alphabetical order, and each one that cares\r\nto, presents to the convention the name of her \"favorite son.\" Thus in the\r\nrepublican convention of 1860, when Illinois was called, the name of\r\nAbraham Lincoln was presented; and when New York was called, the name of\r\nWilliam H. Seward was presented, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"roll of the states\" is completed, the balloting begins. In the\r\nrepublican convention, nomination is by majority vote; in the democratic,\r\nit takes a two-thirds vote to nominate.\r\n\r\nThe vice-president is then nominated in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nAfter adopting a platform the convention adjourns.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW CONGRESS IS ORGANIZED. [Footnote: See also Among the Lawmakers,\r\nchapter III. ]\r\n\r\nThough the senate is quite a permanent body, two-thirds of its members\r\nholding over from one congress to another, its committees are reorganized\r\nat the beginning of each congress.\r\n\r\nThe terms of all members of the house of representatives expire March 4 of\r\nthe odd-numbered years, and, though many of the old members are\r\nre-elected, the house must be reorganized at the beginning of each\r\ncongress. The mode of organizing the house is briefly as follows:\r\n\r\n1. At the first session, the house is called to order by the clerk of the\r\npreceding house, who then calls the roll of members-elect [Footnote: The\r\nmembers-elect have previously sent him their certificates of election,\r\nreceived from the state canvassing board.] by states. If a quorum is found\r\nto be present, the clerk declares it to be in order to proceed to the\r\nelection of a speaker. The vote is _viva voce_ on the call of the roll,\r\neach member when his name is called pronouncing the name of his choice for\r\nspeaker. Election is by majority of the votes given. The result is\r\ndeclared by the clerk, who \"then designates two members (usually of\r\ndifferent politics, and from the number of those voted for as speaker) to\r\nconduct the speaker-elect to the chair; and also one member (usually that\r\none who has been longest in continuous service a member of the house) to\r\nadminister to him the oath required by the constitution.\" [Footnote:\r\nManual of the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\nThe speaker then administers the oath to the members, in groups of about\r\nforty, all standing in line before the speaker's desk.\r\n\r\n3. The organization is completed by the election of a clerk, a\r\nsergeant-at-arms; a doorkeeper, a postmaster, and a chaplain. The vote is\r\n_viva voce_, and the term is \"until their successors are chosen and\r\nqualified\"--usually about two years, though all are subject to removal at\r\nthe will of the house.\r\n\r\nThe delegates from the territories are then sworn in.\r\n\r\n\"At this stage it is usual for the house to adopt an order that a message\r\nbe sent to the senate to inform that body that a quorum of the house of\r\nrepresentatives has assembled, and that --------, one of the\r\nrepresentatives from the state of ----, has been elected speaker, and -----\r\n---, a citizen of the state of ---, has been chosen clerk, and that the\r\nhouse is now ready to proceed to business.\" [Footnote: Manual of the House\r\nof Representatives.]\r\n\r\nEach house then orders a committee of three members to be appointed, the\r\njoint committee \"to wait upon the president of the United States and\r\ninform him that a quorum of the two houses has assembled, and that\r\ncongress is ready to receive any communication he may be pleased to make.\"\r\n[Footnote: Manual of the House of Representatives.] It is in order then\r\nfor the president to forward his message to congress.\r\n\r\nThe above are the _usual_ proceedings, and they generally occur on the\r\nfirst day of the session.\r\n\r\nThe seating of the members is by lot, except in the case of certain\r\nmembers privileged by very long experience or otherwise, who are by\r\ncourtesy permitted to make the first selection. Each member is numbered,\r\nand corresponding numbers are placed in a box \"and thoroughly\r\nintermingled.\" Then the numbers are drawn from the box successively by a\r\npage, the member whose number is drawn first having first choice of seat,\r\nand so on. This may be done while the committees are waiting on the\r\npresident, as above described.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW CONTESTED ELECTIONS ARE SETTLED.\r\n\r\n\"Each house shall be the judge of the elections, returns, and\r\nqualifications of its own members.\"--Constitution, I., 5, 5.\r\n\r\nA contested election resembles very much in its mode of settlement the\r\ntrial of a civil suit.\r\n\r\n1. Within thirty days after the result of the election is made known, the\r\ncontestant must serve upon the person declared elected by the canvassing\r\nboard a notice of intention to contest his seat, and the grounds therefor.\r\n\r\n2. Within thirty days of receiving said notice, the member-elect must\r\nanswer it, stating specifically the grounds of his defense, and must serve\r\na copy of this answer upon the contestant.\r\n\r\n3. Ninety days are then allowed for the taking of testimony--the first\r\nforty to the contestant, the second forty to the member-elect, and the\r\nremaining ten to the contestant for testimony in rebuttal.\r\n\r\nTestimony may be taken before any United States, state or municipal judge,\r\nnotary public, or by two justices of the peace. The opposite party must\r\nhave due notice of the times and places of taking the evidence; but\r\ntestimony may be taken at several places at the same time. The witnesses\r\nare summoned by subpoena served in the usual way. The examination of the\r\nwitnesses is by the officer issuing the subpoena, but either party may\r\npropose questions. The questions and answers are committed to writing, and\r\nauthenticated.\r\n\r\nAll the papers in each case, certified, carefully sealed, and the\r\nenvelopes indorsed with name of the case, are sent by mail to Washington,\r\naddressed to the clerk of the house in which is the contested seat.\r\n\r\nThe matter is referred to the committee on elections. [Footnote: This is\r\nthe oldest of all the committees, having been established at the beginning\r\nof the first congress.] This committee having carefully considered the\r\nmatter may bring in its report at any time, this being what is known as a\r\n\"privileged question.\" The decision is by majority vote of the house\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the person who has obtained the certificate of election\r\nfrom the state canvassing board is presumed to have been elected, and is\r\ntreated accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn order that lack of means may not compel a man to submit to a wrong, and\r\nthat the real will of the congressional district as expressed in the\r\nelection may be ascertained, the contestant may be allowed not to exceed\r\ntwo thousand dollars for expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW AN IMPEACHMENT CASE IS CONDUCTED.\r\n\r\n\"The house of representatives ... shall have the sole power of\r\nimpeachment.\"--Constitution I. 2: 9.\r\n\r\n\"The senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.'--Ib., I. 3:\r\n6.\r\n\r\n\"The president, vice-president, and all civil officers of the United\r\nStates, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction\r\nof, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\"--Ib., II. 4:\r\n17.\r\n\r\nThe house, having resolved that a certain civil officer be impeached,\r\norders that a committee be appointed to notify the senate of the fact; and\r\nto state that \"the house of representatives will, in due time, exhibit\r\nparticular articles of impeachment against him, and make good the same;\"\r\nand to demand that the senate prepare to try the impeachment.\r\n\r\nThe house then, on motion, appoints a committee (usually of five members)\r\nto prepare carefully the articles of impeachment. [Footnote: This\r\ncorresponds to the indictment of a grand jury.] The report of this\r\ncommittee, having been considered in committee of the whole, is reported\r\nto the house, with such amendments as seem necessary. If the report is\r\nagreed to by the house, a committee of five \"managers\" is appointed to\r\nconduct the impeachment on the part of the house.\r\n\r\nThe senate is then notified by the clerk of the house, that the managers,\r\nnaming them, have been appointed, and that the articles of impeachment are\r\nready to be exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe senate having appointed the time when it would resolve itself into a\r\ncourt of impeachment notifies the house. At the appointed time the\r\nmanagers carry the articles to the senate, and on their return report to\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThe senate then issues a summons to the defendant, ordering him to file\r\nhis answer with the secretary of the senate by a certain day.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed, the house, having resolved itself into committee of\r\nthe whole, attends the trial in the senate chamber. The next day the house\r\nattends similarly, if a reply is to be made to the defendant's answer.\r\nDuring the taking of the testimony only the managers attend, the house\r\ndevoting itself to its regular business. When the case is ready for\r\nargument, the house attends daily, as committee of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe report of the final action of the senate is made to the house by the\r\nchairman of the committee of the whole.\r\n\r\nIn an impeachment trial the senate is both judge and jury. But, for\r\nconvenience, the functions of judge are usually performed by the president\r\nof the court of impeachment; and a senator may be called upon to testify.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of the senate corresponds to the clerk of the court, and the\r\nsergeant-at-arms corresponds to the sheriff in an ordinary court.\r\n\r\n\"On the final question whether the impeachment is sustained, the yeas and\r\nnays shall be taken on each article of impeachment separately; and if the\r\nimpeachment shall not, upon any of the articles presented, be sustained by\r\nthe votes of two-thirds of the members present, a judgment of acquittal\r\nshall be entered; but if the person accused in such articles of\r\nimpeachment shall be convicted upon any of said articles by the votes of\r\ntwo-thirds of the members present, the senate shall proceed to pronounce\r\njudgment, and a certified copy of such judgment shall be deposited in the\r\noffice of the secretary of state.\" [Footnote: Manual of the United States\r\nSenate.] Only seven cases of impeachment before the U.S. senate have\r\noccurred.

If a vacancy occurs in the senate during\r\nthe session of the legislature, the election occurs on the second Tuesday\r\nafter notice of the vacancy is received by the legislature.\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed, the roll of each house being called, each member\r\nresponds by naming one person for the senatorship. The result of the vote\r\nis entered on the journal of each house by the clerk thereof.\r\n\r\nThe next day at noon, the members of both houses convene in joint\r\nassembly, and the journal of each house is read. If the same person has\r\nreceived a majority of all the votes in each house, he is declared\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nBut if no person has received such majority, the joint assembly proceeds\r\nto choose, by _viva voce_ vote of each member present, a person for\r\nsenator. A quorum consists of a majority of each house, and a majority of\r\nthose present and voting is necessary to a choice.\r\n\r\nIf no one receives such majority on the first day, the joint assembly\r\nmeets daily at noon, and takes at least one vote, until a senator is\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nA certificate of election is made out by the governor, countersigned and\r\nauthenticated under seal of the state by the secretary of state, and\r\nforwarded to the president of the senate of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE ELECTORAL VOTE IS COUNTED.\r\n\r\n\"The president of the senate shall, in the presence of the senate and\r\nhouse of representatives, open all the certificates, and the vote shall\r\nthen be counted.\"--Constitution, Amendment XII.\r\n\r\nThe constitution gives no directions as to the manner of counting. No\r\ntrouble was experienced, however, until the Hayes-Tilden election. The\r\nresult of this election depended upon the votes of three states, each of\r\nwhich sent in two conflicting sets of certificates. There being no legal\r\nprovision for the settlement of such disputes, the famous electoral\r\ncommission was created to determine which certificates should be counted.\r\nIt consisted of five senators, five representatives, and five justices of\r\nthe supreme court.\r\n\r\nThe gravity of the danger thus revealed made it obviously necessary that\r\nsome general plan be devised whereby such disputes might be obviated.\r\nThough consideration of the subject began at once, and various measures\r\nwere from time to time proposed, no satisfactory solution was presented\r\nuntil February 3, 1887, when the Electoral Count Bill was passed and\r\nreceived the signature of the president.\r\n\r\nAn outline of the bill is here given, the principal provisions being the\r\nsecond and sixth as here numbered.\r\n\r\n1. The electors shall meet and vote on the second Monday in January\r\nfollowing their election. [Footnote: The time of meeting had been the\r\nfirst Wednesday in December. The change was made to give time for the\r\nsettlement of any disputes, as provided in the second section.]\r\n\r\n2. If there be any disputes as to the choice of the electors, they are to\r\nbe settled in the respective states in the way that each state shall\r\ndetermine, provided that the laws governing the matter shall have been\r\npassed before the election, and that disputes shall have been settled at\r\nleast six days before the time fixed for the meeting of the electors. A\r\nreport of the contest and its mode of settlement shall be made by the\r\ngovernor, and forwarded under seal to the secretary of state of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n3. As soon as practicable after it shall have been ascertained who have\r\nbeen chosen electors, the executive of the state shall transmit under the\r\nseal of the state to the secretary of state of the United States the names\r\nof the electors, with an abstract of the popular vote for each candidate\r\nfor elector. The executive shall also deliver to the electors, on or\r\nbefore the day of meeting, three copies of said certificate, one of which\r\nthe electors shall enclose with each \"list of persons voted for as\r\npresident and vice-president.\"\r\n\r\n4. As soon as practicable after receiving the certificates as aforesaid,\r\nthe secretary of state shall publish them in full in such newspaper as he\r\nshall designate; and at the first meeting of congress thereafter he shall\r\ntransmit to each house a copy in full of each certificate received.\r\n\r\n5. The counting of the vote will take place, as heretofore, on the second\r\nWednesday in February following the meeting of the electors. At one\r\no'clock in the afternoon the senate and house of representatives meet in\r\nthe hall of the house of representatives, and the president of the senate\r\ntakes the chair.\r\n\r\n\"Two tellers shall be previously appointed on the part of the senate and\r\ntwo on the part of the house of representatives, to whom shall be handed,\r\nas they are opened by the president of the senate, all the certificates\r\nand papers purporting to be certificates of the electoral votes, which\r\ncertificates and papers shall be opened, presented, and acted upon in the\r\nalphabetical order of the states, beginning with the letter A; and said\r\ntellers, having then read the same in the presence and hearing of the two\r\nhouses, shall make a list of the votes as they shall appear from the said\r\ncertificates; and the votes having been ascertained and counted in the\r\nmanner and according to the rules in this act provided the result of the\r\nsame shall be delivered to the president of the senate, who shall\r\nthereupon announce the state of the vote, which announcement shall be\r\ndeemed a sufficient declaration of the persons, if any, elected president\r\nand vice-president of the United States, and, together with a list of the\r\nvotes, be entered on the journals of the two houses.\"\r\n\r\n6. Upon the reading of each certificate the president of the senate asks\r\nwhether there be any objections to it. Objection must be made in writing,\r\nand must \"state clearly and concisely, and without argument, the ground\r\nthereof.\" To entitle it to consideration, the objection must be signed by\r\nat least one senator and one representative.\r\n\r\nWhen all the objections to any paper have been received and read, the\r\nsenate withdraws, and the two houses proceed separately to consider them.\r\n\r\nIf from any state but one set of electors are certified, and the\r\ncertification has been done as prescribed in section three, the\r\ncertificate cannot be rejected. But if not properly certified, the two\r\nhouses acting concurrently \"may reject the vote or votes when they agree\r\nthat such vote or votes have not been so regularly given by those whose\r\nappointment has been so certified.\"\r\n\r\nIf more than one return has been received from any state, those votes only\r\nshall be counted which have been determined as provided in section two.\r\n\r\nIf two or more returns appear, each certified by authorities claiming to\r\nbe the lawful tribunal of the state, the vote shall be counted which the\r\ntwo houses, acting separately, \"concurrently decide is supported by the\r\ndecision of such state so authorized by its laws.\"\r\n\r\nIf more than one return comes in from any state, no determination such as\r\nis prescribed in section two having been made, the two houses concurrently\r\ndecide which, if any, of the votes shall be counted. If in such a case the\r\nhouses disagree, the votes of those electors shall be counted whose\r\nappointment shall have been certified by the executive of the state.\r\n\r\nWhen the case in question has been disposed of, the joint session is\r\nresumed and the counting continued.\r\n\r\n7. In the joint meeting, the president of the senate has authority to\r\npreserve order. No debate is allowed, and no question can be put, \"except\r\nto either house on a motion to withdraw.\"\r\n\r\n8. When discussing an objection, in separate session, no member can speak\r\nmore than once, and then for not longer than five minutes. The entire time\r\nfor discussion is limited to two hours.\r\n\r\n9. Provision is made for the seating of every one entitled to a seat on\r\nthe floor of the house; and the act declares that \"such joint meeting\r\nshall not be dissolved until the count of electoral votes shall be\r\ncompleted and the result declared.\"\r\n\r\nSome time after the passage of the law, it was discovered that a strange\r\nomission had been made. By the old law, the electors in each state were\r\nrequired to appoint a messenger to take one of the certificates of votes\r\ncast, and deliver it to the president of the senate on or before the\r\n_first Wednesday_ in January. By the new law the electors do not meet\r\nuntil the _second Monday_ in January. The inconsitency was remedied,\r\nhowever, by a supplementary act, providing that certificates shall be\r\nforwarded \"as soon as possible,\" and authorizing the president of the\r\nsenate to send for missing certificates on the fourth Monday in January.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE ARE EXTRADITED.\r\n\r\nExtradition is \"the delivering up to justice of fugitive criminals by the\r\nauthorities of one state or country to those of another.\" [Footnote:\r\nLalor's Cyclopedia of Political Science.]\r\n\r\nThe duty of extradition between the states of this republic is imposed by\r\nthe federal constitution, IV. 2; and the mode of procedure is prescribed\r\nby an act of congress passed in 1793. The term \"other crimes\" used in the\r\nconstitution is generally interpreted \"so as to include any offense\r\nagainst the laws of the state or territory making the demand.\" On the\r\nquestion whether the executive upon whom demand is made is bound to\r\ncomply, the federal courts have decided that his duty in the matter is\r\nimperative; that he must deliver up the fugitive, unless the accused shall\r\nalso be under prosecution for breach of the laws of the state to which he\r\nhas fled.\r\n\r\nThe procedure is this: \"The accused must be indicted in the state in which\r\nthe crime was committed, or a charge must be brought against him before a\r\nmagistrate, who, if satisfied that the charge is true, issues a warrant\r\nfor the arrest of the criminal. A copy of the indictment or affidavit is\r\nforwarded to the executive of the state, and he issues to the executive of\r\nthe state to which the fugitive has gone, a requisition for his surrender.\r\nIf the executive upon whom the requisition is made is satisfied that the\r\npapers are regular and the proof of the crime sufficient,\" he issues a\r\nwarrant \"for the arrest and delivery of the accused to the agent of the\r\nstate making the demand.\"\r\n\r\nThe expense of these proceedings is borne by the state making the demand.\r\n\r\nBetween nations extradition is regarded as a matter of comity, and is\r\nbased upon special treaty. \"In this country, power to make such a\r\nsurrender is conferred upon the executive [Footnote: This of course means\r\nthe president, as states cannot treat with foreign powers.] only where the\r\nUnited States are bound by treaty, and have a reciprocal right to claim\r\nsimilar surrender from the other power.\" In relation to the crimes for\r\nwhich extradition may be demanded, it may be said in general that they are\r\nspecified in the treaty, and are such offenses as are recognized as crimes\r\nby both countries. Consequently no two treaties are exactly alike.\r\nGenerally only things wrong in themselves, not things wrong by local\r\nprohibition, are included. Offenses merely political are not included; and\r\n\"as opinions differ in different countries on what constitutes a political\r\ncrime, the surrendering nation is very properly made the judge of this\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nAs a corollary to the preceding, it is a well-established rule of\r\ninternational law, that the surrendered party can be tried only on the\r\nallegations for which extradition has been accorded. This principle is\r\nalso generally recognized among the states.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW A COURT MARTIAL IS CONDUCTED.\r\n\r\nA court martial is \"a court consisting of military or naval officers, for\r\nthe trial of offenses against military or naval laws.\"\r\n\r\nCourts martial are of three classes, general, garrison, and regimental.\r\nGeneral courts martial consists of from five to thirteen officers,\r\nappointed by a general or by the president. Garrison and regimental courts\r\nmartial consist of three officers appointed respectively by the garrison\r\nand the regimental commanders. Only general courts martial have\r\njurisdiction of capital offenses.\r\n\r\nThere are two marked characteristics of courts martial. First, the accused\r\nis tried, not as in a civil court by his peers, but by his superiors.\r\nSecond, there is no distinction between judge and jury; the officers\r\ncomprising the court act in both capacities--they determine the fact and\r\napply the law. Sentence is by majority vote, except that to pronounce\r\nsentence of death a two-thirds vote is necessary.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, one of the officers is designated to act as president by\r\nthe order convening the court. As prosecutor in the case, and also as the\r\n_responsible_ adviser of the court, a judge-advocate is appointed, usually\r\nby the same order. The accused is entitled to counsel; but if he is unable\r\nto obtain any, the judge-advocate \"must insist upon all rights belonging\r\nto the accused under the law and the evidence.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"findings\" of a court martial must in each case be transmitted to the\r\nconvening authority and by it be approved, before being carried into\r\nexecution. \"In time of peace, no sentence of a court martial involving\r\nloss of life or the dismissal of a commissioned officer, and either in\r\ntime of peace or war no sentence against a general officer, can be carried\r\ninto effect without approval by the president of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of courts martial extend only over offenses committed by\r\npersons enlisted in the military or the naval service of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY AND HOW TERRITORIES ARE ORGANIZED.\r\n\r\nThe organization of territories in the United States is for two purposes:\r\nto provide good government while population is sparse, and to encourage\r\ntheir development into self-governing commonwealths, and their\r\nincorporation into the federal system as rapidly as possible. (See page\r\n217.)\r\n\r\nTerritories are organized by congress. In the organic act the boundaries\r\nof the territory are defined, and a system of government is established.\r\n\"The governor and the administrative and judicial officers are appointed\r\nby the president, but a territorial legislature is entrusted with limited\r\npowers, subject to the approval of congress.\"\r\n\r\nEach of the several territories may elect one delegate to a seat in the\r\nUnited States Congress. The delegate may speak on subjects in which his\r\nterritory is interested, but he cannot vote.\r\n\r\nWHY AND HOW THE PUBLIC LANDS ARE SURVEYED.\r\n\r\nThe public lands are not meant to be held forever by the general\r\ngovernment. They are designed to be owned and occupied by American\r\ncitizens. To divide the land into pieces and thus to facilitate the\r\ndescription and the location of any piece, is the principal purpose of the\r\nsurvey. Incidentally the portions six miles square serve as bases for the\r\npolitical divisions called towns, and this was part of the original plan.\r\n\r\nThe \"old thirteen\" and Maine, Vermont, Kentucky, Tennessee, and West\r\nVirginia were surveyed in a very irregular way. Lands were described as\r\nbounded by lines running from stumps to stones, thence to a creek and down\r\nthe main channel thereof. In 1785, a committee of the continental congress\r\nwas appointed, with Thomas Jefferson as chairman, to devise a simple and\r\nuniform mode of surveying the public lands in what was about to be\r\norganized as the Northwest Territory.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable peculiarity of the system is that it is rectangular. A\r\nprime meridian is first determined, then a baseline crossing it at right\r\nangles. Then from points on the baseline six miles and multiples thereof\r\nfrom the meridian, lines are run due north. And parallels to the base-line\r\nare run at distances of six miles. The approximate squares thus formed are\r\ncalled townships. The rows of townships running north and south are called\r\nranges. Townships are numbered north and south from the base-line; ranges\r\neast and west from the meridian. The diagram on page 341 illustrates the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nSince meridians all terminate at the poles, the lines between ranges,\r\nbeing meridians, gradually approach each other as they go northward. The\r\nlines, then, soon become so much less than six miles apart that a new\r\nbeginning has to be made. The parallel upon which this correction is made\r\nis naturally called the correction line. Corrections were at first made\r\nevery thirty-six miles, but they are now made every twenty-four miles.\r\n\r\nThe first prime meridian starts at the mouth of the Great Miami and forms\r\nthe western boundary of Ohio. The second prime meridian begins at the\r\nmouth of Little Blue Creek, in Indiana. The third, at the mouth of the\r\nOhio; the fourth at the mouth of the Illinois; and the fifth at the mouth\r\nof the Arkansas. [Illustration: RANGES AND TOWNSHIPS] [Illustration: The\r\nnumbering of sections in a township.] [Illustration: Divisions of a\r\nsection.] The first prime meridian has several base-lines. The base-line\r\nof the second meridian crosses it about twenty-four miles north of its\r\npoint of beginning, and the base-line of the third is a continuation of\r\nthat of the second. The principal base-line of the fourth meridian\r\ncoincides with the southern boundary of Wisconsin. It has also a short\r\nbase-line about six miles north of Quincy, Ills. The base-line of the\r\nfifth meridian is just south of Little Rock, Ark.\r\n\r\nFrom the first meridian most of Ohio is surveyed; from the second, Indiana\r\nand the eastern twenty-four miles of Illinois; from the third, the rest of\r\nIllinois, except a small portion north of Quincy; from the fourth, the\r\nportion of Illinois just referred to, all of Wisconsin, and that part of\r\nMinnesota east of the Mississippi; from the fifth, Arkansas, Missouri,\r\nIowa, Minnesota west of the Mississippi, and the Dakotas east of the\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nThe sixth coincides with meridian 97° 22', west of Greenwich. From it are\r\nsurveyed Kansas, Nebraska, Dakota south and west of the Missouri, Wyoming,\r\nand all of Colorado except the valley of the Rio Grande del Norte.\r\n\r\nMichigan, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and the states and territories in\r\nthe far west are surveyed from special meridians.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO SECURE PUBLIC LANDS.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, only surveyed lands are subject to entry. Under the\r\nmineral land laws, however, claims can be located upon unsurveyed lands.\r\n\r\nThe public lands are divided as to price into two classes: those whose\r\nminimum price is $1.25 per acre and those whose minimum is $2.50 per acre.\r\nThe latter, usually called \"double minimum lands,\" are in most cases the\r\nalternate sections reserved in railroad or other public land grants. In\r\nsome cases Indian reservations restored to the public domain have been\r\nrated differently, the price varying from below the single minimum to\r\nabove the double minimum.\r\n\r\nThe remaining public lands are subject to entry under the homestead law,\r\nthe desert land law, and the timber and stone act; by the location of\r\nscrip; and as town-site entries. Mineral lands are subject to entry only\r\nunder the mining laws; and special laws provide for the disposal of coal\r\nlands and lands containing petroleum. Any person who is the head of a\r\nfamily or is over twenty-one years old, and who is a citizen of the United\r\nStates, or has declared his or her intention to become such, may enter 160\r\nacres of land without cost, except the land-office fees provided by law,\r\ninhabiting, cultivating, and making actual residence thereon for the\r\nperiod of five years; or such a settler may at the expiration of fourteen\r\nmonths from date of settlement commute the entry by paying the government\r\nprice for the land.\r\n\r\nNo part of the public domain is now (since 1889) subject to private cash\r\nentry, except in the state of Missouri and in cases where Congress has\r\nmade special provision therefor. The preemption and timber culture laws\r\nwere repealed in 1891. It has also been provided that no public lands of\r\nthe United States shall be sold by public sale, except abandoned military\r\nreservations of less than 5,000 acres, mineral lands and other lands of a\r\nspecial nature, and isolated tracts that have been subject to homestead\r\nentry for three years after the surrounding land has been disposed of.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SLAVERY WAS ABOLISHED IN THE SEVERAL STATES.\r\n\r\nThe slave _trade_ was prohibited by congress in 1808. From that time on it\r\nwas a felony to bring slaves into the United States.\r\n\r\nSlavery never legally existed in the states carved out of the Northwest\r\nTerritory. It was forbidden by the ordinance of 1787.\r\n\r\nVermont abolished it in forming her state constitution in 1777. [Footnote:\r\nBefore her admission into the Union.]\r\n\r\nMassachusetts, by constitution, 1780.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania, gradual abolition by statute, began in 1780; had 64 in 1840.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire, by constitution, 1783.\r\n\r\nRhode Island and Connecticut, gradual abolition, 1784.\r\n\r\nNew York began in 1799, finished July 4, 1827.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey began in 1804, but had 18 in 1860.\r\n\r\nBy the Missouri compromise, 1820, slavery ceased \"in all that territory\r\nceded by France to the United States, under the name of Louisiana, which\r\nlies north of 36 degrees and 30 minutes north latitude,\" [Footnote: Thomas\r\namendment to act for admitting Missouri.] except Missouri. This part of\r\nthe act was, in the Dred Scott case, declared by the supreme court to be\r\ninvalid, still a provision forbidding slavery found its way into the\r\nconstitution of each of the states afterward seeking admission.\r\n\r\nBy the emancipation proclamation, Jan. 1, 1863, the slaves of those in\r\narms against the United States were declared free.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth amendment, adopted 1865, abolished slavery in all parts of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW VOTING IS DONE IN LEGISLATIVE BODIES. [Footnote: See also Among the\r\nLawmakers, pp. 168-70.]\r\n\r\nAcclamation.--The most common way of voting on ordinary questions is by\r\nacclamation; that is, when a question is put those in favor of it say\r\n\"aye,\" and then those opposed say \"no.\" In this case, a majority of those\r\nvoting prevails. This is sometimes called voting _viva voce._\r\n\r\nDivision.--If the presiding officer is uncertain as to which side is in\r\nthe majority, he may call for a division, or this may be demanded by any\r\nmember. Then those voting in the affirmative stand and are counted, after\r\nwhich those voting in the negative do similarly.\r\n\r\nYea and Nay.--On important questions in congress, or on any question by\r\ndemand of one-fifth of the members, the vote is by \"yeas and nays\" that\r\nis, the roll is called, and each member responds \"yea\" or \"nay.\" In some\r\nstates, including Minnesota, _all bills_ must be voted on in this way, and\r\nmust receive a majority of the total membership in order to pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW LAWS ARE MADE. [Footnote: The Minnesota process, given as a type.]\r\n\r\nFraming a Bill.--A bill is a proposed law. The framing or drawing up of a\r\nbill may be done by any person. For instance, a citizen desiring\r\nlegislation on any matter may formulate a bill for consideration by the\r\nlegislature. But many requests for legislation come in the form of\r\npetitions, in which case the member to whom the matter is committed by the\r\npetitioners usually frames the bill. Many bills originate in committee,\r\nsome of them as substitutes.\r\n\r\nBringing in.--At the time set in the daily order of business for\r\nintroducing bills, the member announces his bill by title, which should\r\nindicate the matter considered therein, and sends it to the clerk's desk.\r\n\r\nFirst Reading.--No bill can pass without at least three readings. When a\r\nbill is first presented, the clerk reads it at the table, and hands it to\r\nthe speaker, who, rising, states to the house the title of the bill, and\r\nthat this is the first reading of it.\r\n\r\nCommitment.--Unless objection is made, the bill, if not one which has been\r\nformulated by a committee, is then referred for careful consideration to a\r\ncommittee, standing or special. The number of subjects coming before a\r\nlegislative body is too great to permit the initial consideration of each\r\nby the whole body. It is a note-worthy fact that our lawmaking is\r\nvirtually committee legislation. All bills for appropriating money shall\r\nbefore passage be referred to the finance committee.\r\n\r\nSecond Reading.--When reported favorably by the committee, with\r\namendments, such amendments must be read in full, and if they are adopted\r\nthe bill passes to its second reading, which is by title only. If the bill\r\nis of a general nature, it is printed and placed on the General Orders or\r\nlist of bills ready for consideration by the committee of the whole.\r\n\r\nCommittee of the Whole.-This consists of the entire membership of the\r\nhouse. Its work is to perfect bills before they come up for final passage.\r\nTo this end great freedom of debate is permitted. This is the last\r\nopportunity to offer amendments, except by unanimous consent. When the\r\nhouse resolves itself into committee, the regular presiding officer leaves\r\nthe chair after designating a member to act as chairman. When the\r\ncommittee rises, the presiding officer resumes the chair and the chairman\r\nof the committee reports its action. Bills reported favorably are\r\nengrossed, that is, rewritten neatly as amended, and are placed on the\r\nCalendar, or list of bills ready for third reading.\r\n\r\nThird Reading.--This is in full, and the question is on the passage of the\r\nbill. If passed the bill is sent to the other house, with the announcement\r\nthat it has passed the first house.\r\n\r\nAction in other House.--The bill is treated in the other house as in the\r\nfirst. If passed, it is returned similarly to the house in which it\r\noriginated. If passed with amendments, these are considered.  ENROLLMENT.--\r\nWhen it has passed both houses, the bill is plainly and accurately written\r\non parchment, under supervision of the committee on enrolled bills.\r\n\r\nSIGNING.--The enrolled bill is signed by the presiding officer of each\r\nhouse, and, if he approves it, by the executive.\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION.--The bill is then carried by the executive to the secretary\r\nof state, who deposits it among the archives. Copies are made for\r\npublication. [Footnote: Read Among the Lawmakers, pp. 60-64.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.--SOME PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature and Origin.--A savage meeting in the forest a person whom he has\r\nnever seen before is apt to look upon him as a foe. As civilization\r\nincreases, danger to one's personal rights decreases, and stranger ceases\r\nto mean enemy. It has gradually come about that the confidence and\r\ncourtesy shown to one another by men in their individual relations have\r\nextended to the relations of states. Morality, reason, and custom have\r\nestablished among the nations certain rules of conduct with respect to one\r\nanother. The rules constitute what is called international law.\r\n\r\nAs might be guessed, international law is a matter of comparatively recent\r\norigin, and exists only among the most highly civilized nations. Not being\r\nthe enactment of any general legislative body, having no courts competent\r\nto pass upon it nor executive to enforce its provisions, this law must be\r\nframed by agreement, and its carrying out must rest upon national good\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE RELATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe great purpose of international law being to preserve peace by removing\r\nthe causes of war, we shall first consider some of the arrangements\r\noperative in times of peace.\r\n\r\nNon-interference.--Among individuals it is found that, as a rule, it is\r\nbest for each person to mind his own business. Similarly, among nations\r\nnon-interference by one with the internal affairs of another is a cardinal\r\nprinciple. It is, therefore, a general rule that a people may adopt such\r\nform of government as they choose, and that whenever they wish they may\r\namend or entirely alter it. [Footnote: A change in the form of government\r\ndoes not release the nation from prior obligations.] And the government\r\nformed has a right to operate without dictation from other powers. Nor has\r\nany foreign nation a right to inquire _how_ the government has come into\r\nbeing; sufficient that it _is_ the government.\r\n\r\nThis right of a nation to manage its own affairs is called _sovereignty_.\r\nIt belongs to a small independent nation as completely as to a large one.\r\nThe act of one government in acknowledging the validity and sovereignty of\r\nanother is called _recognizing_ it. (See page 349, last paragraph.)\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes a delicate question to determine whether to recognize a\r\ncommunity as a nation or not. Thus, if a dependency is seeking to become\r\nindependent, our personal sympathies are naturally with it, and yet it\r\nmight be contrary to the law of nations, an \"unfriendly act\" to the\r\nsovereign power, for our government to recognize its independence. During\r\nthe struggle of the Spanish-American colonies for separate political\r\nexistence, John Quincy Adams, then (1822) secretary of state, formulated\r\nthe proper rule of action thus: \"In every question relating to the\r\nindependence of a nation two principles are involved, one of right and the\r\nother of fact, the former exclusively depending upon the determination of\r\nthe nation itself, and the latter resulting from the successful execution\r\nof that determination ... The government of the United States yielded to\r\nan obligation of duty of the highest order by recognizing as independent\r\nstates nations which, after deliberately asserting their right to that\r\ncharacter, have maintained and established it against all the resistance\r\nwhich had been or could be brought to oppose it. This recognition is ...\r\nthe mere acknowledgment of existing facts.\" [Footnote: Wharton's\r\nInternational Law Digest, Volume I., page 162.]\r\n\r\nAlthough sovereignty implies the right of a government to enter freely\r\ninto such relations with any other nation as may be mutually agreeable,\r\nthe nations of Europe feel at liberty in self-defense to interfere with\r\nany arrangements that threaten the \"balance of power.\" Thus France would\r\nfeel justified in opposing a very close alliance between Prussia and\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nIt is our good fortune not to have any dangerous neighbors. We are\r\nreasonably sure of peace so long as we act in accordance with the counsel\r\nof Washington, \"Friendly relations with all, entangling alliances with\r\nnone.\"\r\n\r\nJurisdiction.--It is clear that the authority of a nation properly extends\r\nover the land within its borders and over its inland waters. It is equally\r\nclear that no nation should have exclusive jurisdiction over the ocean. It\r\nis generally understood that a nation's authority extends out into the sea\r\na marine league from shore. But difficulty is encountered in determining a\r\nrule of jurisdiction over bays, straits, wide-mouthed rivers and other\r\ncoast-waters. Shall the United States of right freely navigate the St.\r\nLawrence to its mouth, and the British the Yukon? Should Denmark receive\r\ntribute of ships passing through the sounds to the Baltic, and may Turkey\r\nprohibit foreign war vessels from passing through the Bosphorus? Is the\r\nmouth of the Amazon part of the \"high seas?\" Is Hudson's Bay? Is Delaware\r\nBay? The difficulty is to formulate a rule that shall not unnecessarily\r\nabridge commercial freedom but shall still have due regard to national\r\ndefense. The question at large is not settled yet, but it seems to be\r\nagreed that in the cases of bays not more than ten miles wide at the\r\nmouth, the marine league shall be measured from a straight line joining\r\nthe headlands.\r\n\r\n\"The United States cannot purchase a grant of land in, or concession of\r\nright of way over, the territories of another nation, as could an\r\nindividual or a private corporation.\"\r\n\r\nIntercourse.--While as an act of sovereignty a nation may shut out from\r\nits borders any or all of the rest of mankind, intercourse is so natural\r\nand is usually so mutually profitable that such prohibition is almost\r\nunknown among civilized nations. Intercourse is regulated in different\r\nnations in various ways. Some limit or control it by a passport system;\r\nsome by special supervision of strangers; some by a protective tariff;\r\nothers by giving to one nation commercial privileges not given to another.\r\n\r\nAmong the general rules that govern intercourse are these: Aliens are\r\nentitled to protection from violence for themselves and their property.\r\nThey are amenable to the laws of the country in which they are sojourning,\r\nexcept in certain oriental and other partly civilized countries. Aliens\r\nmay expatriate themselves and may become naturalized in the land of their\r\nadoption. \"The right of emigration is inalienable; only self-imposed or\r\nunfulfilled obligations can restrict it.\" [Footnote: Heffter, quoted, in\r\nWoolsey's International Law.]\r\n\r\nThe principle that crime should be tried and punished where committed\r\nstands in the way of the trial of a culprit who has escaped to another\r\ncountry. But for mutual protection most of the civilized nations have\r\ntreaties for the extradition of criminals. The United States have\r\nextradition treaties with over twenty countries. (See How Criminals Are\r\nExtradited, page 337.)\r\n\r\nAmbassadors and Consuls.--We have considered briefly the rights and duties\r\nof individual sojourners in foreign lands. Let us now consider the modes\r\nand means of intercourse between the governments themselves.\r\n\r\nFormerly when a nation wished to come to an understanding with another it\r\nsent a special messenger clothed with necessary authority to act; but for\r\nabout two hundred years these representatives have, as a rule, taken up\r\ntheir residence at the capitals of the countries to which they are sent.\r\n\r\nThere are various grades of these ambassadors. Ours in order of rank are\r\nambassadors, envoys-extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary, ministers\r\nresident, envoys, charges d'affaires, and, temporarily, secretaries of\r\nlegation.\r\n\r\n\"Ambassadors [including all of the above] always and everywhere have had\r\nspecial immunities and often something of a sacred character ... Neither\r\npublic authority nor private persons can use any force, or do any violence\r\nto him, without offending against the law of nations.\" [Footnote: Except\r\nthat if necessary for self-defense, passive resistance may be made.] This\r\nimmunity extends to his house, furniture, and attendants. Except in\r\nextreme cases, he is exempt from civil or criminal process.\r\n\r\nThese diplomatic agents are appointees of the executive. Official\r\ncommunications with the president are made through the secretary of state.\r\n\"In all negotiations between nations, sovereign should always speak to\r\nsovereign and minister to minister.\"\r\n\r\nA country may decline to receive _any_ ambassador from a certain nation;\r\nand this may be necessary in case of a civil war in which two parties\r\nclaim to be the legal authorities, because receiving the ambassador of one\r\nparty would be equivalent to recognizing it as the legitimate authority.\r\nAnd it may, without offense, decline to receive a _particular_ ambassador,\r\non account of some objection to him personally. It may also decline to\r\ntreat with a minister who has so deported himself as to become\r\ndistasteful.\r\n\r\nWhen an ambassador arrives at the capitol of the country to which he is\r\nsent, he seeks an interview with the secretary in charge of foreign\r\naffairs and delivers to him a copy of his credentials. Afterwards on a day\r\nappointed for the purpose, the secretary presents him to the executive\r\n(sovereign or president), to whom he delivers the original commission.\r\n\r\nAmbassadors of all grades are expected to avoid all interference with\r\npolitical movements in the countries where they are stationed.\r\n\r\nConsuls are the commercial agents of a country. They are stationed at the\r\nprincipal ports of the world. Their chief functions are:\r\n\r\n1. To furnish their government information that may be of service in the\r\ncommercial relations of the countries.\r\n\r\n2. To settle disputes between masters and crews of merchant vessels in the\r\nport sailing under the protection of the flag of the consul's country.\r\n\r\n3. To reclaim deserters from vessels, and provide for destitute seamen.\r\n\r\n4. In some non-Christian lands to act as judge in cases in which a\r\ncountryman or other person from a Christian state is a party. (See also\r\npage 321.)\r\n\r\nTreaties.--Treaties are contracts between nations[1], and in international\r\nlaw much resemble ordinary contracts in municipal law. For instance, they\r\ncan be made only by certain persons--the constituted authorities of\r\nnations, or by persons specially deputed by them for that purpose. A\r\ntreaty cannot obligate to do an unlawful act. There must be consideration\r\n--a treaty which sacrifices the interests of one party is not binding upon\r\nthat party. Treaties obtained by fraud or force are not binding.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This from Woolsey's International Law is too good to be\r\nomitted: \"A contract is one of the highest acts of human free-will; it is\r\nthe will binding itself in regard to the future, and surrendering its\r\nright to change expressed intention, so that it becomes morally and\r\njurally a wrong to act otherwise; it is the act of two parties in which\r\neach or one of the two conveys power over himself to the other in\r\nconsideration of something; done or to be done by the other. The binding\r\nforce of contracts is to be deduced from the freedom and foresight of man,\r\nwhich would have almost no sphere in society or power of co-operation,\r\nunless trust could be excited. Trust lies at the basis of society; society\r\nis essential for the development of the individual; the individual could\r\nnot develop his free forethought unless an acknowledged obligation made\r\nhim sure in regard to the actions of others. That nations as well as\r\nindividuals are bound by contract, will not be doubted when we remember\r\nthat they have the same properties of free will and foresight; that they\r\ncan have no safe intercourse otherwise.\"]\r\n\r\nFurther similarity between municipal and international law is to be seen.\r\nThe minister appointed to negotiate the treaty is an agent, and his work\r\nis subject to the general law of agency. Thus, if he acts within his\r\ninstructions, his principal (the nation) is bound by what he does, and the\r\ntreaty-making power is in honor bound to ratify the treaty. From this it\r\nwill properly be inferred that there is an implied understanding that the\r\nsovereign, or other power intrusted with the making of treaties, reserves\r\nthe right to accept or reject the work of the agent. (See sample treaty,\r\npage 360.)\r\n\r\nRemedy.--In municipal law, remedy for a wrong is obtained through the\r\ncourts, if personal influence fails. Among nations there is no general\r\ncourt having jurisdiction. If redress cannot be obtained by remonstrance,\r\narbitration, or other peaceful means, it may be sought through retaliation\r\nor finally in war.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR RELATIONS.\r\n\r\n\"International law assumes that there must be wars and fightings among\r\nnations, and endeavors to lay down rules by which they shall be brought\r\nwithin the limits of justice and humanity.\"\r\n\r\nCauses.--A nation may wage war to defend any right which as a state it is\r\nbound to protect, to redress wrong, or to prevent injury; for instance, to\r\ndefend its own sovereignty; to protect a citizen in his rights; to obtain\r\nsatisfaction for insults to its flag, its ambassadors, or its good name;\r\nfor the violation of treaty rights; to prevent injury, as by checking the\r\nonward march of some \"conquering hero.\" War for conquest is not now\r\nrecognized as legitimate.\r\n\r\nBeginning.--\"War between independent sovereignties, is and ought to be, an\r\n_avowed, open_ way of obtaining justice.\" Even among the ancients\r\nannouncements were usually made before war was begun. The Greeks sent a\r\nherald to carry the news. \"Among the Romans the ceremonies of making known\r\nthe state of war were very punctilious.\" But formal declarations of war\r\nare now falling into disuse; not from any intention of taking the enemy\r\nunawares, but because of the rapidity with which news is now disseminated.\r\nStill a state is in honor bound to indicate in some way its changed\r\nrelation. This is due to the enemy, and just to its own citizens and to\r\nneutrals, that they may know how to act. The enemy is usually informed by\r\nthe peremptory dismissal of its ambassador; the citizens and neutrals by a\r\nmanifesto of some kind. (See p.354.)\r\n\r\nBetween whom.--War being an interruption of peaceful relations, commerce\r\nbetween the citizens is at an end--is forbidden. Contracts between them\r\nthen become either \"impossible in their nature\" or \"unlawful,\" and\r\ntherefore void.\r\n\r\nThe war is not between the individual citizens of the two countries, it is\r\nbetween the governments and is waged by authorized agents--the soldiers\r\nand sailors enlisted for the purpose. \"The smallest amount of injury\r\nconsistent with self-defense and the sad necessity of war, is to be\r\ninflicted.\" Passive citizens are not unnecessarily to be molested.\r\n\r\nWeapons.--Not \"all things are fair in war.\" Though ingenuity may properly\r\ntax itself to produce death-dealing instruments, underhanded means, such\r\nas poisoning springs or spreading a plague, are condemned; nor is it now\r\nregarded as consistent with right for a civilized nation to employ against\r\nanother, persons accustomed to an inhuman mode of warfare.\r\n\r\nHeralds and Spies.--Heralds bearing flags of truce are inviolable--they\r\nmust not be molested. Spies, unless in their regimentals, are subject to\r\nthe death penalty if caught.\r\n\r\nPirates and Privateers.--Pirates, acting under no authority, having no\r\npurpose to serve except to enrich themselves at the expense of any one\r\nelse, are not protected by any nation, and may be put to death by any one\r\ncapturing them. But privateers, acting as an arm of the government and by\r\nits authority, granted by its letters of marque and reprisal, must be\r\ntreated as prisoners of war.\r\n\r\nPrisoners of War.--Prisoners taken in war were formerly the property of\r\ntheir captors, to be used for their pleasure or profit as slaves. Modern\r\nusage requires that they be merely detained; that they be fed and\r\nsheltered with reasonable comfort, and not treated with any unnecessary\r\nharshness. A common practice, worthy of encouragement, is that of\r\nexchanging prisoners, thus restoring them to their own side. Sometimes,\r\ntoo, prisoners are released on _parole,_ that is, on their word of honor\r\nnot to re-enter the army. If a paroled prisoner breaks his word in this\r\nrespect, upon recapture he is liable to be put to death.\r\n\r\nTermination.--Peace comes by treaty. There is usually a preliminary\r\ntreaty, containing the general statement of conditions to which both\r\nparties will consent. When all the details have been arranged, a\r\ndefinitive treaty is concluded. Treaties of peace go into effect as\r\nbetween the parties, when they are signed; as between individuals of the\r\nbelligerent nations, when they are notified.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF NEUTRALS.\r\n\r\nWhen intercourse between the countries of the world was small, owing to\r\nlack of facilities, the rights of neutrals were regarded as unimportant.\r\nBut intercourse has increased so enormously, that no great war can be\r\nwaged without interfering with the interests of almost all the rest of the\r\nworld, and the rights of neutrals are assuming more importance in\r\ninternational law.\r\n\r\nThe great obligation resting upon neutrals is \"to allow nothing to the\r\nbelligerents which either would object to as being adverse to his\r\ninterests.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Neutrals may do.--The common instincts of humanity may be complied\r\nwith. Thus a ship of war in distress may run into a neutral port. Soldiers\r\nrunning into neutral territory may be disarmed and then protected as\r\nnon-combatants.\r\n\r\nThings Contraband.--It is a breach of neutrality to lend money or furnish\r\ntroops or munitions of war to a belligerent, or to allow ships of war to\r\nbe built by citizens of the neutral power within its borders, if it knows\r\n(or _should_ know) that they are to be armored and used in the service of\r\none of the belligerents.\r\n\r\nCitizens of Neutral States.--Members of a neutral state may lend money to\r\na belligerent or may go into the army or navy of a belligerent without\r\nbreach of the neutrality of their nation. They may sell goods, except\r\nmaterials of war, to either belligerent,  Blockade.--A belligerent may, as\r\na war measure, close the ports of the enemy. This is called a blockade.\r\nTwo things are necessary to make a blockade valid--due notice must be\r\ngiven, and the blockade must be made effective by placing before the ports\r\narmed vessels to prevent the entrance of trading vessels. If the\r\nconditions have been complied with, neutrals trade with the port at the\r\nrisk of losing all captured ships and cargoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF WAR--1812.\r\n\r\nAn act declaring war between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, and the dependencies thereof, and the United States of America\r\nand their territories.[Footnote: Drawn by William Pinckney, Attorney\r\nGeneral of the United States.]\r\n\r\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, That war be, and the same is\r\nhereby declared to exist between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, and the dependencies thereof, and the United States of America\r\nand their territories; and that the President of the United States is\r\nhereby authorized to use the whole land and naval force of the United\r\nStates to carry the same into effect, and to issue to private armed\r\nvessels of the United States commissions, or letters of marque and general\r\nreprisal, in such form as he shall think proper, and under the seal of the\r\nUnited States, against the vessels, goods, and effects, of the government\r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the subjects\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.--DOCUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nACT AUTHORIZING A STATE GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n[Passed February 26, 1857.]\r\n\r\nSECTION 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America, in Congress assembled, That the inhabitants of\r\nthat portion of the Territory of Minnesota which is embraced within the\r\nfollowing limits, to-wit: beginning at the point in the center of the main\r\nchannel of the Red River of the North, where the boundary line between the\r\nUnited States and the British Possessions crosses the same; thence up the\r\nmain channel of said river to that of the Bois de Sioux River; thence up\r\nthe main channel of said river to Lake Traverse; thence up the centre of\r\nsaid lake to the southern extremity thereof; thence in a direct line to\r\nthe head of Big Stone Lake; thence through its centre to its outlet;\r\nthence by a due south line to the north line of the State of Iowa; thence\r\nalong the northern boundary of said state to the main channel of the\r\nMississippi River; thence up the main channel of said river, and following\r\nthe boundary line of the State of Wisconsin, until the same intersects the\r\nSt. Louis River; thence down the said river to and through Lake Superior\r\non the boundary line of Wisconsin and Michigan, until it intersects the\r\ndividing line between the United States and the British Possessions;\r\nthence up Pigeon River and following said dividing line to the place of\r\nbeginning, be, and they hereby are authorized to form for themselves a\r\nconstitution and state government by the name of the State of Minnesota,\r\nand to come into the Union on an equal footing with the original states,\r\naccording to the federal constitution.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That the State of Minnesota shall have\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction on the Mississippi and all other rivers and waters\r\nbordering on the said State of Minnesota, so far as the same shall form a\r\ncommon boundary to said state and any state or states now or hereafter to\r\nbe formed or bounded by the same; and said river or waters leading into\r\nthe same shall be common highways, and forever free, as well to the\r\ninhabitants of said state as to all other citizens of the United States,\r\nwithout any tax, duty, impost, or toll therefor.\r\n\r\nSEC. 3. And be it further enacted, That on the first Monday in June next,\r\nthe legal voters in each representative district then existing within the\r\nlimits of the proposed state, are hereby authorized to elect two delegates\r\nfor each representative to which said district may be entitled according\r\nto the apportionment for representatives to the territorial legislature,\r\nwhich election for delegates shall be held and conducted, and the returns\r\nmade, in all respects in conformity with the laws of said territory\r\nregulating the election of representatives; and the delegates so elected\r\nshall assemble at the capitol of said territory on the second Monday in\r\nJuly next, and first determine by a vote whether it is the wish of the\r\npeople of the proposed state to be admitted into the Union at that time;\r\nand if so, shall proceed to form a constitution, and take all necessary\r\nsteps for the establishment of a state government, in conformity with the\r\nfederal constitution, subject to the approval and ratification of the\r\npeople of the proposed state.\r\n\r\nSEC 4.

Before leaving\r\nthe ship which had brought them across the Atlantic they drew up this\r\ncompact. They obtained several successive letters patent from the Plymouth\r\nCompany, but none of them were confirmed by the crown, and in 1691 the\r\nPlymouth colony was annexed to Massachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEXAS DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE--1836.\r\n\r\nWhereas, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and other military chieftains\r\nhave, by force of arms, overthrown the federal institutions of Mexico, and\r\ndissolved the social compact which existed between Texas and the other\r\nmembers of the Mexican Confederacy,--Now, the good people of Texas,\r\navailing themselves of their natural rights, solemnly declare:\r\n\r\n1st.

That they do not acknowledge that the present authorities of the\r\nnominal Mexican Republic have the right to govern within the limits of\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\n5th. That they hold it to be their right, during the disorganization of\r\nthe federal system and the reign of despotism, to withdraw from the union,\r\nto establish an independent government, or to adopt such measures as they\r\nmay deem best calculated to protect their rights and liberties, but that\r\nthey will continue faithful to the Mexican government so long as that\r\nnation is governed by the constitution and laws that were formed for the\r\ngovernment of the political association.\r\n\r\n6th.
