W. ROLLESTON\r\n\r\nFIRST HON. SECRETARY OF THE IRISH LITERARY SOCIETY, LONDON; LATE\r\nASSISTANT EDITOR OF THE \"NEW IRISH LIBRARY,\" AND CO-EDITOR OF \"A\r\nTREASURY OF IRISH POETRY\"; AUTHOR OF \"MYTHS AND LEGENDS OF THE CELTIC\r\nRACE,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK\r\nGEORGE H. DORAN COMPANY\r\nPublishers in America for Hodder & Stoughton\r\nMCMXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIRELAND AND POLAND\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom is composed of four distinct nationalities. Each of\r\nthese has retained its own distinct character, its own national history,\r\nits own patriotism and self-respect. Their affairs, great and small,\r\ngeneral or local, are administered by one Parliament in which each is\r\nfully represented. A large majority of the Irish people have, however,\r\nasked that in addition to some representation in the united Parliament\r\nthey shall be granted a local Parliament for the management of their own\r\ninternal affairs. The fact that this demand, which has an important\r\nimperial as well as local bearing, has not yet been complied with has\r\nconstantly been used by the enemies of the Entente Powers to represent\r\nas false and hypocritical the claims of those Powers to be regarded as\r\nthe champions of the rights of small nationalities; and the case of\r\nIreland has been compared with that of Prussian Poland, as though the\r\npeoples of these two countries were suffering the same kind of\r\noppression, the same injustice, the same denial of the right of every\r\nman to live and prosper in his own land on equal terms with his\r\nfellow-citizens in every other part of the realm.\r\n\r\nThe best answer to this charge is to tell plainly, without contention or\r\nexaggeration, what the united Parliament has done for Ireland since the\r\nbeginning of the period of reform nearly fifty years ago. That is what\r\nis here attempted, so far as it can be done in a few pages. It must be\r\nfully understood that on the Home Rule question the present statement\r\nhas no bearing whatever. That difficult problem lies in an altogether\r\ndifferent sphere of politics, and must he judged by considerations which\r\ncannot be touched on here. Without, however, trenching in any degree on\r\ncontroversial ground, it may be pointed out that the crucial difficulty\r\nof the Home Rule question lies, and has always lain, in the fact that in\r\nIreland a substantial and important minority amounting to about 25 per\r\ncent. of the population, and differing from the rest of the country in\r\nreligion, national traditions, and economic development, has hitherto\r\nbeen resolutely opposed to passing from the immediate government of the\r\nimperial Parliament to that of any other body. This minority being, for\r\nthe most part, grouped together in the North-east counties, the late\r\nGovernment attempted to solve the difficulty by offering immediate Home\r\nRule to that section of Ireland which desires it, while leaving the\r\nremainder as it is until Parliament should otherwise decree. This\r\nproposal was rejected by the general opinion of Nationalist Ireland,\r\nwhich was firmly opposed to the partition of the country for any\r\nindefinite period. The question, therefore, remains for the present in\r\nsuspense, until a solution can be found which will not only ensure the\r\nintegrity and security of the Empire but reconcile the conflicting\r\ndesires and interests of Irishmen themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIreland Fifty Years Ago\r\n\r\nSo much to clear the ground in regard to the Home Rule controversy. I\r\nshall now ask the reader to glance for a moment at the condition of\r\nIreland fifty years ago. At that time almost the whole agricultural\r\npopulation were in the position of tenants-at-will, with no security\r\neither against increased rents or arbitrary eviction. The housing of the\r\nrural population, and especially of the agricultural labourers, was\r\nwretched in the extreme. Local taxation and administration were wholly\r\nin the hands of Grand Juries, bodies appointed by the Crown from among\r\nthe country gentlemen in each district. Irish Roman Catholics were\r\nwithout any system of University education comparable to that which\r\nProtestants had enjoyed for three hundred years in the University of\r\nDublin. A Church which, whatever its historic claims may have been,\r\nnumbered only about 12 per cent. of the population was established by\r\nlaw and supported by tithes levied on the whole country. Technical\r\neducation was inaccessible to the great bulk of the nation; and in no\r\ndepartment of public education, of any grade or by whomsoever\r\nadministered, was any attention paid to Irish history, the Irish\r\nlanguage, Irish literature, or any subject which might lead young\r\nIrishmen to a better knowledge and understanding of the special problems\r\nof their country and its special claims to the love and respect of its\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThat was the Ireland of fifty years ago. It is an Ireland which at the\r\npresent day lives only on the lips of anti-British orators and\r\njournalists. It is an Ireland as dead as the France of Louis XIV. Of the\r\nabuses and disabilities just recounted not one survives to-day. The\r\nmeasures by which they have been removed place to the credit of the\r\nUnited Kingdom a record of reform the details of which, for the benefit\r\nof friends or foes, may be here very briefly set down.\r\n\r\n\r\nReligious Equality\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the Protestant Episcopal Church was disestablished and\r\ndisendowed, and is now--many Churchmen believe to its great spiritual\r\nadvantage--on the same level as regards its means of support as every\r\nother denomination in Ireland. It may be mentioned that the Roman\r\nCatholic Church in Ireland was long in the enjoyment of a State subsidy\r\nfor the education of its clergy, a subsidy commuted in 1869 for a\r\ncapital sum of 370,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nLand Reform\r\n\r\nAs comparisons have been drawn between the systems of government in\r\nIreland and in Poland, let us consider for a moment the condition of the\r\nPolish rural population under German rule. It must be noted that the\r\nrecent promises of Polish autonomy made by Germany--obviously for\r\nmilitary and temporary reasons--refer only to those portions of Polish\r\nterritory held by other States. No change is to be made in the position\r\nof Prussian Poland. Here, for many years, it has been, and still is, the\r\navowed object of the Prussian Government either to extirpate or forcibly\r\nTeutonise this Slavonic population, and to replant the country with\r\nGerman colonists. The German Chancellor in 1900, Prince von Buelow,\r\ndefended this anti-Polish policy in the cynical saying that \"rabbits\r\nbreed faster than hares,\" and the meaner animal, the Pole, must\r\ntherefore be drastically kept down in favour of the German. Between 1886\r\nand 1906 the Prussian Government was spending over a million sterling a\r\nyear in buying out Polish landowners, great and small, and planting\r\nGermans in their stead. The measure proved futile; the \"rabbits\" still\r\nmultiplied, for the Poles bought land from German owners faster than the\r\nGovernment did from them. In 1904, in order to check the development of\r\nPolish agriculture and land-settlement, the Government took the extreme\r\nstep of forbidding Poles to build new farmhouses without a licence. A\r\nstill more oppressive measure came in 1908, when, in clear defiance of\r\nthe German Constitution, the Prussian Government actually took powers\r\nand were voted funds--from taxation paid by Poles and Germans alike--for\r\nthe compulsory expropriation of Polish owners against whom nothing\r\nwhatever could be alleged except their non-German nationality. These\r\npowers have been put into operation, and every Pole in Prussia now holds\r\nhis patrimony on his own soil on the sufferance of a Government which\r\nregards his very existence as a nuisance, because he occupies a place\r\nwhich a German might otherwise fill.\r\n\r\nDuring precisely the same period the British Government in Ireland has\r\nbeen bending the wealth and credit of the United Kingdom to objects\r\nprecisely the reverse. Ireland, owing to the wars and confiscations of\r\nthe seventeenth century, had come to have a land-owning aristocracy\r\nmainly of English descent with a Celtic peasantry holding their farms as\r\nyearly tenants. The object of British land-legislation has been to\r\nexpropriate the landlords, so far as their tenanted land is concerned,\r\nand to establish the Irish peasant, as absolute owner of the land he\r\ntills. The Irish tenant is now subject only to rents fixed by law; he\r\ncan at any time sell the interest in his farm, which he has, therefore,\r\na direct interest in improving; he is also assisted by a great scheme of\r\nland-purchase to become owner of his land on paying the price by\r\nterminable instalments, which are usually some 20 per cent. less than\r\nthe amount he formerly paid as rent. Under this scheme about two-thirds\r\nof the Irish tenantry have already become owners of their farms, while\r\nthe remainder enjoy a tenure which is almost as easy and secure as\r\nownership itself. It is not surprising, then, that a German economist\r\nwho has made a special study of this subject should declare that \"the\r\nIrish tenants have had conditions assured to them more favourable than\r\nany other tenantry in the world enjoy\"; adding the dry comment that in\r\nIreland the \"magic of property\" appears to consist in the fact that it\r\nis cheaper to acquire it than not.[*] That magic has been worked for\r\nIreland by the British Legislature and by British credit. As in Prussia,\r\ncompulsory powers (limited by certain conditions and to certain\r\ndistricts) stand behind the schemes of the Government; but the\r\ncompulsion is exercised not against the Irishman in favour of the\r\nEnglish settler, but against the (usually) English landlord in favour of\r\nthe Irish tenant. The State is now pledged to about 130,000,000 pounds\r\nfor the furtherance of this scheme, the instalments and sinking fund to\r\nthe amount of about 5,000,000 pounds a year being paid with exemplary\r\nregularity by the farmers who have taken advantage of it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: Professor M. Bonn, of Munich University. \"Modern Ireland\r\nand her Agrarian Problem,\" pp. 151, 162, translated from \"Die irische\r\nAgrarfrage.\" _Archiv fuer Sozialwissenschaft_; Mohr, Tuebingen.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Congested Districts Board\r\n\r\nIn the poorer and more backward regions of the West it has been felt\r\nthat the above measures are not enough, and a special agency has been\r\nconstituted with very wide powers to help the Western farmer, and not\r\nonly the farmer, but the fisherman, the weaver, or anyone pursuing a\r\nproductive occupation there, to make the most of his resources and to\r\ndevelop his industry in the best possible way. This Board commands a\r\nstatutory endowment of 231,000 pounds a year. A system of light railways\r\nwhich now covers these remote districts has given new and valuable\r\nfacilities for the marketing of fish and every kind of produce.\r\n\r\nThe various Boards and other agencies by which these measures are\r\ncarried into execution are manned almost exclusively by Irishmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural Labourer\r\n\r\nThere is a world of difference between the present lot of the Irish\r\nagricultural labourer and his condition in 1883, when reform in this\r\ndepartment was first taken in hand. Cottages can now be provided by the\r\nRural District Councils and let at nominal rents. Nearly nine millions\r\nsterling have been voted for this purpose at low interest, with sinking\r\nfund, and up to the present date 47,000 cottages have been built, each\r\nwith its plot of land, while several thousand more are sanctioned.\r\n\r\nOf the results of the Labourers' Act a recent observer writes:\r\n\r\n    \"The Irish agricultural labourer can now obtain a cottage with three\r\n    rooms, a piggery, and garden allotment of an acre or half an acre,\r\n    and for this he is charged a rent of one to two shillings a week ...\r\n    These cottages by the wayside give a hopeful aspect to the country\r\n    ... flowers are before the doors of the new cottages and creepers\r\n    upon the walls. The labourer can keep pigs, poultry, and a goat, and\r\n    grow his potatoes and vegetables in his garden allotment.\"[*]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: Padraic Colum: \"My Irish Year,\" pp. 18, 19.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal Government\r\n\r\nIn 1898 a Local Government Bill was passed for Ireland which placed the\r\nadministration of the poor law and other local affairs for rural\r\ndistricts on the same footing as in England. The rule of the Grand\r\nJuries, which had lasted for two and a half centuries, and which had, on\r\nthe whole, carried on local affairs with credit and success, was now\r\nentirely swept away, and elected bodies were placed in full control of\r\nlocal taxation, administration, and patronage. In the case of the larger\r\ntowns free municipal institutions had already existed for some sixty\r\nyears. In these the franchise was now reduced, and is wide enough both\r\nin town and country to admit every class of the population. Since 1899\r\nthe new elective bodies have had important duties to fulfil in regard to\r\nthe development of agriculture and technical instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction\r\n\r\nThis new Irish Department of State grew out of a demand formulated after\r\nlong inquiry and discussion by a voluntary Irish committee representing\r\nboth Unionist and Nationalist opinion. It was established in 1899, and\r\nnow commands the large endowment of 197,000 pounds a year, with a\r\ncapital sum of over 200,000 pounds. The annual endowment is clear of all\r\ncharges for offices and staff, which are on the Civil Service Estimates.\r\nIts head is a Minister responsible to Parliament, but associated with\r\nhim are Boards of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, two-thirds of\r\nwhich are elected respectively by County and Borough Councils. Without\r\ntheir concurrence no expenditure can be undertaken, and local work is\r\nlargely carried on through committees appointed by these Councils. The\r\npeople at large are therefore intimately and responsibly associated with\r\nthe work of the Department, the annual meetings of which form a kind of\r\nindustrial Parliament, where the whole economic organisation of Ireland\r\ncan be reviewed, debated, and developed. The Department works by\r\nteaching, by inquiry, by experiment, and has an immense field of\r\nactivity in dealing with cattle diseases, the improvement of stock, the\r\ncontrol of creameries, the marketing of produce, etc. It has also\r\nbrought facilities for technical instruction into every important centre\r\nof population.\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity Education\r\n\r\nThis important question was settled in 1908 by the foundation of a new\r\nUniversity, the \"National University,\" with its central authority in\r\nDublin and colleges in Dublin (the old Catholic University of which\r\nCardinal Newman was rector), in Cork, and in Galway. The University is\r\nopen to all creeds, and may not impose religious tests upon its\r\nstudents, but its government is mainly in the hands of the Roman\r\nCatholic hierarchy, and it is accepted as a fair settlement of the\r\nquestion of Catholic higher education in Ireland. In the management of\r\nits internal affairs, the appointment of professors, the selection of\r\ntextbooks, etc., the National University is wholly autonomous and free\r\nfrom Government interference. One of its most remarkable features is\r\nthat the Irish language has been made an obligatory subject for\r\nmatriculation. The endowment of the University, with its constituent\r\ncolleges, amounts to 74,000 pounds a year, and it was voted a capital\r\nsum for building and equipment of 170,000 pounds. It need hardly be said\r\nthat no parallel to this institution exists in Prussian Poland.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage and Native Culture\r\n\r\nIn this as in other respects a comparison with the theory and practice\r\nof German administration may help to place the policy of the United\r\nKingdom in its proper light. When at the Congress of Vienna, 1815,\r\nPrussia definitely acquired her present share of Polish territory, King\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm III promised for himself and his successors, \"on my\r\nkingly word,\" that the Poles should have religious freedom, the use of\r\nthe Polish language in administration, in the Law Courts and in the\r\nschools, and be in all respects on an equality with their German\r\nfellow-citizens. We have already seen how these promises were kept in\r\nregard to the vital question of the ownership of land. They have been no\r\nless flagrantly broken in regard to the national language. The use of\r\nPolish is strictly prohibited at all public meetings. No Polish deputy\r\nto the Reichstag may address his constituents in the only language they\r\nunderstand. Since 1873 German alone may be taught in the national\r\nschools. The language of instruction must be German wherever half the\r\npupils are capable of understanding it, and after 1928 it is decreed\r\nthat no other language must be heard in the schoolroom. A decree of 1899\r\nforbids teachers to use Polish even in their own family circles. Anyone\r\nwho is caught teaching Polish, even gratuitously, is punished by fine or\r\nimprisonment. Polish literature found in the houses of private persons\r\nis confiscated, and its possessors imprisoned, if the police consider it\r\nto bear the least trace of any propagandist character.[*]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: \"The Evolution of Modern Germany,\" by W. H. Dawson, brings\r\ntogether in its twenty-third chapter most of the facts relating to this\r\nquestion. See especially a letter from a prominent member of the Polish\r\naristocracy quoted on p. 475.]\r\n\r\nAll this, it will be seen, is merely the drastic execution tion of the\r\npolicy laid down by Treitschke, the prophet of modern Germany, and more\r\nrecently urged by the most popular living representative of Prussian\r\nideals, H. S. Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n    \"There is,\" writes Chamberlain, \"no task before us so important as\r\n    that of forcing the German language on the world (_die deutsche\r\n    Sprache der Welt aufzuzwingen_.)\" The German has \"a twofold duty\"\r\n    laid on him: \"never must a German abandon his own speech, neither he\r\n    nor his children's children; and in every place, at every time, he\r\n    must remember to compel others to use it until it has triumphed\r\n    everywhere as the German Army has done in war. ... So far as the\r\n    German Empire extends, the clergy must preach in German alone, in\r\n    German alone the teacher must give his lessons ... Mankind must be\r\n    made to understand that anyone who cannot speak German is a\r\n    pariah.\"[*]\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: \"Kriegsaufsaetze,\" 1914.]\r\n\r\nSuch are the ideals and such the practice of the people whom Roger\r\nCasement and one or two other enthusiasts for Gaelic culture in Ireland\r\nhave sought to make the dominant power in that country, because it will\r\nrid them of \"English\" rule.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what \"English\" rule (it is not really English at all, but\r\nthe rule of the United Kingdom) is actually like in regard to this\r\nparticular subject. Up to the decade 1830-40 it may be said that the\r\nIrish language was spoken by fully half the population of Ireland. No\r\nrestrictive measures were in force against it. But during that decade a\r\ngeneral system of elementary education was introduced, and in the Board\r\nSchools the language withered away with astonishing rapidity. At the\r\nlast census (1911) only 16,000 persons were recorded as speaking Irish\r\nalone, while the number of those who knew anything of the language was\r\nonly about 13 per cent. of the population. Whether this change was a\r\nblessing or a bane to Ireland is a subject which is outside the range of\r\nthis discussion, but whatever it was the Irish people themselves had a\r\nfull share of responsibility for the result. With scarcely an exception,\r\nthe abandonment of Irish was approved by the clergy, the political\r\nleaders, and the masses of the people \"The killing of the language,\"\r\nwrites Dr. Douglas Hyde, \"took place under the eye of O'Connell and the\r\nParliamentarians, and, of course, under the eye and with the sanction of\r\nthe Catholic priesthood and prelates ... From a complexity of causes\r\nwhich I am afraid to explain, the men who for the last sixty years have\r\nhad the ear of the Irish race have persistently shown the cold shoulder\r\nto everything that was Irish and racial.\"[*] Their attitude is easily\r\nunderstood. Irish had long ceased to be used for literary purposes. No\r\nIrish newspapers, no Irish books were printed; English was regarded as\r\nthe only available key to the world of modern culture, and Ireland\r\nbecame an English-speaking country without a struggle and almost without\r\na regret.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: \"Beside the Fire,\" pp. xliii, xliv (1890). Dr. Hyde was the\r\nfirst president of the Gaelic League, and is now Professor of Modern\r\nIrish in the National University.]\r\n\r\nIn the early 'nineties, however, a popular movement took shape for the\r\nrescue of what still remained of the language and for its restoration,\r\nso far as was practically possible. Classes for the study of Irish were\r\nformed all over the country, folk-tales were collected, MSS. of\r\nhalf-forgotten poets were disinterred and edited, the first scholarly\r\nand adequate dictionary of modern Irish was compiled,[*] and plays,\r\npoems, and stories began to be written in the re-discovered language.\r\nThese activities were mostly organised and directed by the Gaelic\r\nLeague, a body founded in 1893. One can easily imagine how a Prussian\r\nGovernment would have dealt with such a movement, especially as a\r\ncertain disaffected element in the country immediately began to make use\r\nof it for its own ends. The British Government looked on not only calmly\r\nbut approvingly. When a general demand arose for the effective teaching\r\nof Irish in the elementary schools--though at this time only about\r\n21,000 old people were recorded in the census as ignorant of English--it\r\nwas at once agreed to. Irish had been permitted and paid for, though not\r\nmarkedly encouraged, since 1879. It was now placed on a list of subjects\r\nwhich might be taught in school hours, and extra fees were allotted for\r\nteaching it at the rate of ten shillings per pupil--twice the amount\r\nallowed for French, Latin, or music. Grants are also made to certain\r\ncolleges where teachers of the language can be trained. All this began\r\nin 1901, and since that time over 12,000 pounds a year has been paid for\r\nIrish teaching directly from Imperial funds--about twice the amount\r\ncollected in the same period by voluntary contributions from Ireland and\r\nthe rest of the world. Nor is this the limit of the grant; it is limited\r\nonly by the willingness of school managers and parents to make use of\r\nit. Indirectly, the State is paying much more, for the various\r\nprofessorships and lectureships in Irish subjects--language history,\r\narchaeology, and economies--established under the National University\r\naccount for well over 3,500 pounds a year. Taking the direct expenditure\r\non elementary education alone, the State has paid for Irish teaching\r\nsince 1879 a sum of no less than 209,000 pounds. It may therefore be\r\nclaimed that in cultivating her ancient language and native traditions,\r\nIreland enjoys the fairest and most liberal treatment ever accorded to a\r\nsmall nationality incorporated in a great Empire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: By the Rev. P. S. Dineen; published by the Irish Tests\r\nSociety.]\r\n\r\n\r\nReforms and Their Results\r\n\r\nOn the reforms which have been thus briefly sketched, one or two general\r\nremarks may be in place.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been contended that except by violence, or the menace\r\nof violence, Ireland has never obtained anything from the English\r\nLegislature. It would be truer to say that she has never obtained\r\nanything at all. England is not a sovereign Power, and does not\r\nadminister Irish affairs, nor even her own. What has been gained has\r\nbeen gained from the Legislature of the United Kingdom, in which\r\nIrishmen, like every other race inhabiting that kingdom, have had their\r\nfull share of representation and of influence. And if in Ireland, as in\r\nother countries, the necessity of reform has sometimes been made evident\r\nby disorder, it is wholly untrue to say that this has been always or\r\neven usually the case. Land-reform in its earliest stages, like trade\r\nunionism in England, was accompanied by disorder. But the greatest\r\nmeasure of Irish land-reform--the Wyndham Act of 1903--was worked out on\r\nIrish soil by peaceable discussion among the parties concerned, and\r\nParliament acted at once upon their joint demand. It was in precisely\r\nthe same way that the Department of Agriculture came into being; nor did\r\nthe great measures of Local Government, of University education for\r\nCatholics, of the Labourers' Acts, or the recognition extended to the\r\nGaelic movement, owe their origin to any other cause than the wholesome\r\ninfluences of reason and goodwill.\r\n\r\nThe internal condition of Ireland already shows a marked response to the\r\naltered state of things. It is visible, as many travellers have noticed,\r\nin the face of the country; it is proved by official records and\r\nstatistics. Emigration has declined to its lowest point; education has\r\nspread amongst the people. Irish emigrants, when they do leave their own\r\nshores, take higher positions than ever before. A population of some\r\nfour millions, largely composed of small farmers, has lent forty-seven\r\nmillions sterling to the Government; and, what is still more\r\nsignificant, the deposits in Post Office Savings Banks have risen from\r\nsix millions in 1896 to over thirteen millions the year before the war.\r\nThe new War Loan is reported to have had an extraordinary success in\r\nIreland. On the last day of subscription a single Dublin bank took in\r\none million sterling.[*] With some self-appointed champions of Ireland\r\nabuse of the British Empire is a very popular amusement, but the Irish\r\nfarmer and the Irish trader put their money in it, and with it they\r\nstand to win or lose.\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: The Times, Feb. 17, 1917.]\r\n\r\nIrish agriculture, partly owing to climatic conditions and partly to the\r\nfact that Ireland has a monopoly of the export of live cattle to\r\nEngland, has developed hitherto rather in the direction of\r\ncattle-raising than of tillage; and cattle have increased since 1851\r\nfrom three million to over five million head, and sheep from two\r\nmillions to three million six hundred thousand. Poultry have nearly\r\nquadrupled in the same period. The gross railway receipts--another\r\nsignificant symptom--were 2,750,000 pounds in 1886. In 1915 they had\r\nrisen to 4,831,000 pounds. The co-operative agricultural associations,\r\nin which Ireland has shown the way to the English-speaking world, now\r\nnumber about 1,000, and do a trade of well over five millions a year.\r\nThe thousands of labourers' cottages which have sprung up, each with its\r\nplot of land, have been to the Irish labourers what the Land Acts have\r\nbeen to the farmer--they have completely transformed his economic status\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nAccompanying these symptoms of material progress, we have witnessed in\r\nrecent years a striking outburst of intellectual activity. Irish\r\nliterature, in poetry and drama, has attracted the attention of the\r\nwhole world of culture, and exact and scholarly research in history and\r\narchaeology have flourished and found audiences as they were never known\r\nto do in Ireland till now. This has not been the work of any one section\r\nof the people, either in creed or in politics; but the whole movement\r\nhas been inspired by an Irish patriotism which no sane person regards as\r\nconflicting in any degree with allegiance to the Empire under the\r\nshelter of which it has grown and prospered.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances above set forth do not pretend to be the whole story\r\nabout modern Ireland, nor do they show that the millennium has arrived\r\nin that country. Apart from Home Rule, which is outside our present\r\nfield, much still remains to be done--there is elementary education to\r\nbe advanced, commercial facilities to be developed, land-purchase to be\r\ncompleted. But it is contended that the real facts about Ireland are\r\nwholly and absurdly inconsistent with the picture of that country which\r\nthe friends of Germany circulate so industriously at the present time.\r\nIreland is not an oppressed and plundered nation, ground under the heel\r\nof a foreign Power, and with her individual life deliberately stifled\r\nlike that of Poland in the German Empire. Only through ignorance or\r\nmalice could such an illusion gain currency, and it needs only the touch\r\nof reality--reality which every one can easily see or verify for\r\nhimself--to dispel it for ever from the mind of every candid inquirer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Ireland and Poland, by Thomas William Rolleston",
