Those reasons were many and substantial, based\r\nupon considerations both of a practical and a sentimental nature; but I\r\nhave not attempted an exposition of them, having limited myself to a\r\nnarrative of the events to which they gave rise.\r\n\r\nHaving been myself, during the most important part of the period\r\nreviewed, a member of the Standing Committee of the Ulster Unionist\r\nCouncil, and closely associated with the leaders of the movement, I have\r\nhad personal knowledge of practically everything I have had to record. I\r\nhave not, however, trusted to unaided memory for any statement of fact.\r\nIt is not, of course, a matter where anything that could be called\r\nresearch was required; but, in addition to the _Parliamentary Reports_,\r\nthe _Annual Register_, and similar easily accessible books of reference,\r\nthere was a considerable mass of private papers bearing on the subject,\r\nfor the use of some of which I am indebted to friends.\r\n\r\nI was permitted to consult the Minute-books of the Ulster Unionist\r\nCouncil and its Standing Committee, and also verbatim reports made for\r\nthe Council of unpublished speeches delivered at private meetings of\r\nthose bodies. A large collection of miscellaneous documents accumulated\r\nby the late Lord Londonderry was kindly lent to me by the present\r\nMarquis; and I also have to thank Lord Carson of Duncairn for the use of\r\nletters and other papers in his possession. Colonel F.H. Crawford,\r\nC.B.E., was good enough to place at my disposal a very detailed account\r\nwritten by himself of the voyage of the _Fanny_, and the log kept by\r\nCaptain Agnew. My friend Mr. Thomas Moles, M.P., took full shorthand\r\nnotes of the proceedings of the Irish Convention and the principal\r\nspeeches made in it, and he kindly allowed me to use his transcript. And\r\nI should not like to pass over without acknowledgment the help given me\r\non several occasions by Miss Omash, of the Union Defence League, in\r\ntracing references.\r\n\r\nR.

And as it is nowhere more true than\r\nin Ireland that the events of to-day are the outcome of events that\r\noccurred longer ago than yesterday, and that the motives of to-day have\r\nconsequently their roots buried somewhat deeply in the past, it is no\r\neasy task for the outside observer to gain the insight requisite for\r\nunderstanding fairly the conduct of the persons concerned.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Asquith who very truly said that the Irish question, of which\r\none of the principal factors is the opposition of Ulster to Home Rule,\r\n\"springs from sources that are historic, economic, social, racial, and\r\nreligious.\" It would be a hopeless undertaking to attempt here to probe\r\nto the bottom an origin so complex; but, whether the sympathies of the\r\nreader be for or against the standpoint of the Irish Loyalists, the\r\nactual events which make up what may be called the Ulster Movement would\r\nbe wholly unintelligible without some introductory retrospect. Indeed,\r\nto those who set out to judge Irish political conditions without\r\ntroubling themselves about anything more ancient than their own memory\r\ncan recall, the most fundamental factor of all--the line of cleavage\r\nbetween Ulster and the rest of the island--- is more than\r\nunintelligible. In the eyes of many it presents itself as an example of\r\nperversity, of \"cussedness\" on the part of men who insist on magnifying\r\nmere differences of opinion, which would be easily composed by\r\nreasonable people, into obstacles to co-operation which have no reality\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nWriters and speakers on the Nationalist side deride the idea of \"two\r\nnations\" in Ireland, calling in evidence many obvious identities of\r\ninterest, of sentiment, or of temperament between the inhabitants of the\r\nNorth and of the South. The Ulsterman no more denies these identities\r\nthan the Greek, the Bulgar, and the Serb would deny that there are\r\nfeatures common to all dwellers in the Balkan peninsula; but he is more\r\ndeeply conscious of the difference than of the likeness between himself\r\nand the man from Munster or Connaught. His reply to those who denounced\r\nthe Irish Government Act of 1920 on the ground that it set up a\r\n\"partition of Ireland,\" is that the Act did not \"set up,\" but only\r\nrecognised, the partition which history made long ago, and which wrecked\r\nall attempts to solve the problem of Irish Government that neglected to\r\ntake it into account. If there be any force in Renan's saying that the\r\nroot of nationality is \"the will to live together,\" the Nationalist cry\r\nof \"Ireland a Nation\" harmonises ill with the actual conditions of\r\nIreland north and south of the Boyne. This dividing gulf between the two\r\npopulations in Ireland is the result of the same causes as the political\r\ndissension that springs from it, as described by Mr. Asquith in words\r\nquoted above. The tendencies of social and racial origin operate for the\r\nmost part subconsciously--though not perhaps less powerfully on that\r\naccount; those connected with economic considerations, with religious\r\ncreeds, and with events in political history enter directly and\r\nconsciously into the formation of convictions which in turn become the\r\nmotives for actions.\r\n\r\nIn the mind of the average Ulster Unionist the particular point of\r\ncontrast between himself and the Nationalist of which he is more\r\nforcibly conscious than of any other, and in which all other\r\ndistinguishing traits are merged, is that he is loyal to the British\r\nCrown and the British Flag, whereas the other man is loyal to neither.\r\nReligious intolerance, so far as the Protestants are concerned, of\r\nwhich so much is heard, is in actual fact mainly traceable to the same\r\nsentiment. It is unfortunately true that the lines of political and of\r\nreligious division coincide; but religious dissensions seldom flare up\r\nexcept at times of political excitement; and, while it is undeniable\r\nthat the temper of the creeds more resembles what prevailed in England\r\nin the seventeenth than in the twentieth century, yet when overt\r\nhostility breaks out it is because the creed is taken--and usually taken\r\nrightly--as _prima facie_ evidence of political opinion--political\r\nopinion meaning \"loyalty\" or \"disloyalty,\" as the case may be. The label\r\nof \"loyalist\" is that which the Ulsterman cherishes above all others. It\r\nmeans something definite to him; its special significance is reinforced\r\nby the consciousness of its wearers that they are a minority; it\r\nsustains the feeling that the division between parties is something\r\ndeeper and more fundamental than anything that in England is called\r\ndifference of opinion. This feeling accounts for much that sometimes\r\nperplexes even the sympathetic English observer, and moves the hostile\r\npartisan to scornful criticism. The ordinary Protestant farmer or\r\nartisan of Ulster is by nature as far as possible removed from the being\r\nwho is derisively nicknamed the \"noisy patriot\" or the \"flag-wagging\r\njingo.\" If the National Anthem has become a \"party tune\" in Ireland, it\r\nis not because the loyalist sings it, but because the dis-loyalist shuns\r\nit; and its avoidance at gatherings both political and social where\r\nNationalists predominate, naturally makes those who value loyalty the\r\nmore punctilious in its use. If there is a profuse display of the Union\r\nJack, it is because it is in Ulster not merely \"bunting\" for decorative\r\npurposes as in England, but the symbol of a cherished faith.\r\n\r\nThere may, perhaps, be some persons, unfamiliar with the Ulster cast of\r\nmind, who find it hard to reconcile this profession of passionate\r\nloyalty with the methods embarked upon in 1912 by the Ulster people. It\r\nis a question upon which there will be something to be said when the\r\nnarrative reaches the events of that date. Here it need only be stated\r\nthat, in the eyes of Ulstermen at all events, constitutional orthodoxy\r\nis quite a different thing from loyalty, and that true allegiance to\r\nthe Sovereign is by them sharply differentiated from passive obedience\r\nto an Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe sincerity with which this loyalist creed is held by practically the\r\nentire Protestant population of Ulster cannot be questioned by anyone\r\nwho knows the people, however much he may criticise it on other grounds.\r\nAnd equally sincere is the conviction held by the same people that\r\ndisloyalty is, and always has been, the essential characteristic of\r\nNationalism. The conviction is founded on close personal contact\r\ncontinued through many generations with the adherents of that political\r\nparty, and the tradition thus formed draws more support from authentic\r\nhistory than many Englishmen are willing to believe. Consequently, when\r\nthe General Election of 1918 revealed that the whole of Nationalist\r\nIreland had gone over with foot, horse, and artillery, with bag and\r\nbaggage, from the camp of so-called Constitutional Home Rule, to the\r\nSinn Feiners who made no pretence that their aim was anything short of\r\ncomplete independent sovereignty for Ireland, no surprise was felt in\r\nUlster. It was there realised that nothing had happened beyond the\r\nthrowing off of the mask which had been used as a matter of political\r\ntactics to disguise what had always been the real underlying aim, if not\r\nof the parliamentary leaders, at all events of the great mass of\r\nNationalist opinion throughout the three southern provinces. The whole\r\npopulation had not with one consent changed their views in the course of\r\na night; they had merely rallied to support the first leaders whom they\r\nhad found prepared to proclaim the true objective. Curiously enough,\r\nthis truth was realised by an English politician who was in other\r\nrespects conspicuously deficient in insight regarding Ireland. The\r\nEaster insurrection of 1916 in Dublin was only rendered possible by the\r\nnegligence or the incompetence of the Chief Secretary; but, in giving\r\nevidence before the Commission appointed to inquire into it, Mr. Birrell\r\nsaid: \"The spirit of what to-day is called Sinn Feinism is mainly\r\ncomposed of the old hatred and distrust of the British connection ...\r\nalways there as the background of Irish politics and character\"; and,\r\nafter recalling that Cardinal Newman had observed the same state of\r\nfeeling in Dublin more than half a century before, Mr. Birrell added\r\nquite truly that \"this dislike, hatred, disloyalty (so unintelligible to\r\nmany Englishmen) is hard to define but easy to discern, though incapable\r\nof exact measurement from year to year.\" This disloyal spirit, which\r\nstruck Newman, and which Mr. Birrell found easy to discern, was of\r\ncourse always familiar to Ulstermen as characteristic of \"the South and\r\nWest,\" and was their justification for the badge of \"loyalist,\" their\r\nassumption of which English Liberals, knowing nothing of Ireland, held\r\nto be an unjust slur on the Irish majority.\r\n\r\nIf this belief in the inherent disloyalty of Nationalist Ireland to the\r\nBritish Empire did any injustice to individual Nationalist politicians,\r\nthey had nobody but themselves to blame for it. Their pronouncements in\r\nAmerica, as well as at home, were scrutinised in Ulster with a care that\r\nEnglishmen seldom took the trouble to give them. Nor must it be\r\nforgotten that, up to the date when Mr. Gladstone made Home Rule a plank\r\nin an English party's programme--which, whatever else it did, could not\r\nalter the facts of the case--the same conviction, held in Ulster so\r\ntenaciously, had prevailed almost universally in Great Britain also; and\r\nhad been proclaimed by no one so vehemently as by Mr. Gladstone himself,\r\nwhose famous declarations that the Nationalists of that day were\r\n\"steeped to the lips in treason,\" and were \"marching through rapine to\r\nthe dismemberment of the Empire,\" were not so quickly forgotten in\r\nUlster as in England, nor so easily passed over as either meaningless or\r\nuntrue as soon as they became inconvenient for a political party to\r\nremember. English supporters of Home Rule, when reminded of such\r\nutterances, dismissed with a shrug the \"unedifying pastime of unearthing\r\nburied speeches\"; and showed equal determination to see nothing in\r\nspeeches delivered by Nationalist leaders in America inconsistent with\r\nthe purely constitutional demand for \"extended self-government.\"\r\n\r\nUlster never would consent to bandage her own eyes in similar fashion,\r\nor to plug her ears with wool. The \"two voices\" of Nationalist leaders,\r\nfrom Mr. Parnell to Mr. Dillon, were equally audible to her; and, of the\r\ntwo, she was certain that the true aim of Nationalist policy was\r\nexpressed by the one whose tone was disloyal to the British Empire.\r\nLook-out was kept for any change in the direction of moderation, for any\r\nreal indication that those who professed to be \"constitutional\r\nNationalists\" were any less determined than \"the physical force party\"\r\nto reach the goal described by Parnell in the famous sentence, \"None of\r\nus will be ... satisfied until we have destroyed the last link which\r\nkeeps Ireland bound to England.\"\r\n\r\nNo such indication was ever discernible. On the contrary, Parnell's\r\nphrase became a refrain to be heard in many later pronouncements of his\r\nsuccessors, and the policy he thus described was again and again\r\npropounded in after-years on innumerable Nationalist platforms, in\r\nspeeches constantly quoted to prove, as was the contention of Ulster\r\nfrom the first, that Home Rule as understood by English Liberals was no\r\nmore than an instalment of the real demand of Nationalists, who, if they\r\nonce obtained the \"comparative freedom\" of an Irish legislature--to\r\nquote the words used by Mr. Devlin at a later date--would then, with\r\nthat leverage, \"operate by whatever means they should think best to\r\nachieve the great and desirable end\" of complete independence of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThis was an end that could not by any juggling be reconciled with the\r\nUlsterman's notion of \"loyalty.\" Moreover, whatever knowledge he\r\npossessed of his country's history--and he knows a good deal more, man\r\nfor man, than the Englishman--confirmed his deep distrust of those whom,\r\nfollowing the example of John Bright, he always bluntly described as\r\n\"the rebel party.\" He knew something of the rebellions in Ireland in the\r\nseventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, and was under no\r\nillusion as to the design for which arms had been taken up in the past.\r\nHe knew that that design had not changed with the passing of\r\ngenerations, although gentler methods of accomplishing it might\r\nsometimes find favour. Indeed, one Nationalist leader himself took\r\npains, at a comparatively recent date, to remove any excuse there may\r\never have been for doubt on this point. Mr. John Redmond was an orator\r\nwho selected his words with care, and his appeals to historical\r\nanalogies were not made haphazard. When he declared (in a speech in\r\n1901) that, \"in its essence, the national movement to-day is the same as\r\nit was in the days of Hugh O'Neill, of Owen Roe, of Emmet, or of Wolfe\r\nTone,\" those names, which would have had but a shadowy significance for\r\na popular audience in England, carried very definite meaning to the ears\r\nof Irishmen, whether Nationalist or Unionist. Mr. Gladstone, in the\r\nfervour of his conversion to Home Rule, was fond of allusions to the\r\nwork of Molyneux and Swift, Flood and Grattan; but these were men whose\r\nIrish patriotism never betrayed them into disloyalty to the British\r\nCrown or hostility to the British connection. They were reformers, not\r\nrebels. But it was not with the political ideals of such men that Mr.\r\nRedmond claimed his own to be identical, nor even with that of\r\nO'Connell, the apostle of repeal of the Union, but with the aims of men\r\nwho, animated solely by hatred of England, sought to establish the\r\ncomplete independence of Ireland by force of arms, and in some cases by\r\ncalling in (like Roger Casement in our own day) the aid of England's\r\nforeign enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the face of appeals like this to the historic imagination of an\r\nimpressionable people, it is not surprising that by neither Mr.\r\nRedmond's followers nor by his opponents was much account taken of his\r\nown personal disapproval of extremes both of means and ends. His\r\nopponents in Ulster simply accepted such utterances as confirmation of\r\nwhat they had known all along from other sources to be the actual facts,\r\nnamely, that the Home Rule agitation was \"in its essence\" a separatist\r\nmovement; that its adherents were, as Mr. Redmond himself said on\r\nanother occasion, \"as much rebels as their fathers were in 1798\"; and\r\nthat the men of Ulster were, together with some scattered sympathisers\r\nin the other Provinces, the depositaries of the \"loyal\" tradition.\r\n\r\nThe latter could boast of a pedigree as long as that of the rebels. If\r\nMr. Redmond's followers were to trace their political ancestry, as he\r\ntold them, to the great Earl of Tyrone who essayed to overthrow England\r\nwith the help of the Spaniard and the Pope, the Ulster Protestants could\r\nclaim descent from the men of the Plantation, through generation after\r\ngeneration of loyalists who had kept the British flag flying in Ireland\r\nin times of stress and danger, when Mr. Redmond's historical heroes were\r\nmaking England's difficulty Ireland's opportunity.\r\n\r\nThere have been, and are, many individual Nationalists, no doubt,\r\nespecially among the more educated and thoughtful, to whom it would be\r\nunjust to impute bad faith when they professed that their political\r\naspirations for Ireland were really limited to obtaining local control\r\nof local affairs, and who resented being called \"Separatists,\" since\r\ntheir desire was not for separation from Great Britain but for the\r\n\"union of hearts,\" which they believed would grow out of extended\r\nself-government. But the answer of Irish Unionists, especially in\r\nUlster, has always been that, whatever such \"moderate,\" or\r\n\"constitutional\" Nationalists might dream, it would be found in\r\npractice, if the experiment were made, that no halting-place could be\r\nfound between legislative union and complete separation. Moreover, the\r\nsame view was held by men as far as possible removed from the standpoint\r\nof the Ulster Protestant. Cardinal Manning, for example, although an\r\nintimate personal friend of Gladstone, in a letter to Leo XIII, wrote:\r\n\"As for myself, Holy Father, allow me to say that I consider a\r\nParliament in Dublin and a separation to be equivalent to the same\r\nthing. Ireland is not a Colony like Canada, but it is an integral and\r\nvital part of one country.\"[1]\r\n\r\nIt is improbable that identical lines of reasoning led the Roman\r\nCatholic Cardinal and the Belfast Orangeman and Presbyterian to this\r\nidentical conclusion; but a position reached by convergent paths from\r\nsuch distant points of departure is defensible presumably on grounds\r\nmore solid than prejudice or passion. It is unnecessary here to examine\r\nthose grounds at length, for the present purpose is not to argue the\r\nUlster case, but to let the reader know what was, as a matter of fact,\r\nthe Ulster point of view, whether that point of view was well or ill\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nBut, while the opinion that a Dublin Parliament meant separation was\r\nshared by many who had little else in common with the Ulster\r\nProtestants, the latter stood alone in the intensity of their conviction\r\nthat \"Home Rule meant Rome Rule.\" It has already been mentioned that it\r\nis the \"disloyalty\" attributed rightly or wrongly to the Roman Catholics\r\nas a body that has been, in recent times at all events, the mainspring\r\nof Protestant distrust. But sectarian feeling, everywhere common between\r\nrival creeds, is, of course, by no means absent. Englishmen find it hard\r\nto understand what seems to them the bigoted and senseless animosity of\r\nthe rival faiths in Ireland. This is due to the astonishing shortness of\r\ntheir memory in regard to their own history, and their very limited\r\noutlook on the world outside their own island. If, without looking\r\nfurther back in their history, they reflected that the \"No Popery\"\r\nfeeling in England in mid-Victorian days was scarcely less intense than\r\nit is in Ulster to-day; or if they realised the extent to which\r\nGambetta's \"Le cléricalisme, voilà l'ennemi\" continues still to\r\ninfluence public life in France, they might be less ready to censure the\r\nIrish Protestant's dislike of priestly interference in affairs outside\r\nthe domain of faith and morals. It is indeed remarkable that\r\nNonconformists, especially in Wales, who within living memory have\r\ndisplayed their own horror of the much milder form of sacerdotalism to\r\nbe found in the Anglican Church, have no sympathy apparently with the\r\nPresbyterian and the Methodist in Ulster when the latter kick against\r\nthe encompassing pressure of the Roman Catholic priesthood, not in\r\neducational matters alone, but in all the petty activities of every-day\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhenever this aspect of the Home Rule controversy was emphasised\r\nEnglishmen asked what sort of persecution Irish Protestants had to fear\r\nfrom a Parliament in Dublin, and appeared to think all such fear\r\nillusory unless evidence could be adduced that the Holy Office was to be\r\nset up at Maynooth, equipped with faggot and thumb-screw. Of persecution\r\nof that sort there never has been, of course, any apprehension in\r\nmodern times. Individual Catholics and Protestants live side by side in\r\nIreland with fully as much amity as elsewhere, but whereas the Catholic\r\ninstinctively, and by upbringing, looks to the parish priest as his\r\ndirector in all affairs of life, the Protestant dislikes and resists\r\nclerical influence as strongly as does the Nonconformist in England and\r\nWales--and with much better reason. For the latter has never known\r\nclericalism as it exists in a Roman Catholic country where the Church is\r\nwholly unrestrained by the civil power. He has resented what he regards\r\nas Anglican arrogance in regard to educational management or the use of\r\nburying-grounds, but he has never experienced a much more aggressive\r\nclerical temper exercised in all the incidents of daily life--in the\r\nmarket, the political meeting, the disposition of property, the\r\namusements of the people, the polling booth, the farm, and the home.\r\n\r\nThis involves no condemnation of the Irish priest as an individual or as\r\na minister of his Church. He is kind-hearted, charitable, and\r\nconscientious; and, except that it does not encourage self-reliance and\r\nenterprise, his influence with his own people is no more open to\r\ncriticism than that of any other body of religious ministers. But the\r\nRoman Catholic Church has always made a larger claim than any other on\r\nthe obedience of its adherents, and it has always enforced that\r\nobedience whenever it has had the power by methods which, in Protestant\r\nopinion, are extremely objectionable. In theory the claim may be limited\r\nto affairs concerned with faith and morals; but the definition of such\r\naffairs is a very elastic one. Cardinal Logue not many years ago said:\r\n\"When political action trenches upon faith or morals or affects\r\nreligion, the Vicar of Christ, as the supreme teacher and guardian of\r\nfaith and morals, and as the custodian of the immunities of religion,\r\nhas, by Divine Right, authority to interfere and to enforce his\r\ndecisions.\" How far this principle is in practice carried beyond the\r\nlimits so denned was proved in the famous Meath election petition in\r\n1892, in which the Judge who tried it, himself a devout Catholic,\r\ndeclared: \"The Church became converted for the time being into a vast\r\npolitical agency, a great moral machine moving with resistless\r\ninfluence, united action, and a single will. Every priest who was\r\nexamined was a canvasser; the canvas was everywhere--on the altar, in\r\nthe vestry, on the roads, in the houses.\" And while an election was in\r\nprogress in County Tyrone in 1911 a parish priest announced that any\r\nCatholic who should vote for the Unionist candidate \"would be held\r\nresponsible at the Day of Judgment.\" A still more notorious example of\r\nclericalism in secular affairs, within the recollection of Englishmen,\r\nwas the veto on the Military Service Act proclaimed from the altars of\r\nthe Catholic Churches, which, during the Great War, defeated the\r\napplication to Ireland of the compulsory service which England,\r\nScotland, and Wales accepted as the only alternative to national defeat\r\nand humiliation.\r\n\r\nBut these were only conspicuous examples of what the Irish Protestant\r\nsees around him every day of his life. The promulgation in 1908 of the\r\nVatican decree, _Nec Temere_, a papal reassertion of the canonical\r\ninvalidity of mixed marriages, followed as it was by notorious cases of\r\nthe victimisation of Protestant women by the application of its\r\nprinciples, did not encourage the Protestants to welcome the prospect of\r\na Catholic Parliament that would have control of the marriage law; nor\r\ndid they any more readily welcome the prospect of national education on\r\npurely ecclesiastical lines. Another Vatican decree that was equally\r\nalarming to Protestants was that entitled _Motu Proprio_, by which any\r\nCatholic layman was _ipso facto_ excommunicated who should have the\r\ntemerity to bring a priest into a civil court either as defendant or\r\nwitness. Medievalism like this was felt by Ulster Protestants to be\r\nirreconcilable with modern ideas of democratic freedom, and to indicate\r\na temper that boded ill for any regime which would be subject to its\r\ninspiration. These were matters, it is true,--and there were perhaps\r\nsome others of a similar nature--on which it is possible to conceive\r\nmore or less satisfactory legislative safeguards being provided; but as\r\nregards the indefinable but innumerable minutiae in which the prevailing\r\necclesiastical standpoint creates an atmosphere in which daily life has\r\nto be carried on, no safeguards could be devised, and it was the\r\nrealisation of this truth in the light of their own experience that made\r\nthe Ulstermen continually close their ears to allurements of that sort.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Church is quite consistent, and from its own point of view\r\npraiseworthy, in its assertion of its right, and its duty, to control\r\nthe lives and thoughts of men; but this assertion has produced a clash\r\nwith the non-ecclesiastical mind in almost every country, where\r\nCatholicism is the dominant religious faith. But in Ireland, unlike\r\nContinental countries, there is no Catholic lay opinion--or almost\r\nnone--able to make its voice heard against clerical dictation, and\r\nconsequently the Protestants felt convinced, with good reason, that any\r\nlegislature in Ireland must take its tone from this pervading mental and\r\nmoral atmosphere, and that all its proceedings would necessarily be\r\ntainted by it.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1885 the political complexion of Ulster was in the main\r\nLiberal. The Presbyterians, who formed the majority of the Protestant\r\npopulation, collateral descendants of the men who emigrated in the\r\neighteenth century and formed the backbone of Washington's army, and\r\ndirect descendants of those who joined the United Irishmen in 1798, were\r\nof a pronounced Liberal type, and their frequently strong disapproval of\r\nOrangeism made any united political action an improbable occurrence. But\r\nthe crisis brought about by Gladstone's declaration in favour of Home\r\nRule instantly swept all sections of Loyalists into a single camp. There\r\nwas practically not a Liberal left who did not become Unionist, and,\r\nalthough a separate organisation of Liberal Unionists was maintained,\r\nthe co-operation with Conservatives was so whole-hearted and complete as\r\nalmost to amount to fusion from the outset.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cessation of class friction was still more remarkable. For\r\nmore than a decade the perennial quarrel between landlord and tenant had\r\nbeen increasing in intensity, and the recent land legislation had\r\ndisposed the latter to look upon Gladstone as a deliverer. Their\r\ngratitude was wiped out the moment he hoisted the green flag, while the\r\nlabourers enfranchised by the Act of 1884 eagerly enrolled themselves\r\nas the bitterest enemies of his new Irish policy. The unanimity of the\r\ncountry-side was matched in the towns, and especially in Belfast, where,\r\nwith the single exception of a definitely Catholic quarter, employer and\r\nartisan were as whole-heartedly united as were landlord and tenant in\r\npassionate resentment at what they regarded as the betrayal by England's\r\nforemost statesman of England's only friends in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Home Rule Bill of 1886 brought relief from the\r\nimmediate strain of anxiety. But it was at once realised that the\r\nencouragement and support given to Irish disloyalty for the first time\r\nby one of the great political parties in Great Britain was a step that\r\ncould never be recalled. Henceforth the vigilance required to prevent\r\nbeing taken unawares, and the untiring organisation necessary for making\r\neffective defence against an attack which, although it had signally\r\nfailed at the first onslaught, was certain to be renewed, welded all the\r\npreviously diverse social and political elements in Ulster into a single\r\ncompact mass, tempered to the maximum power of resistance. There was\r\nroom for no other thought in the minds of men who felt as if living in a\r\nbeleaguered citadel, whose flag they were bound in honour to keep flying\r\nto the last. The \"loyalist\" tradition acquired fresh meaning and\r\nstrength, and its historical setting took a more conscious hold on the\r\npublic mind of Ulster, as men studied afresh the story of the Relief of\r\nDerry or the horrors of 1641. Visits of encouragement from the leaders\r\nof Unionism across the Channel, men like Lord Salisbury, Mr. Balfour,\r\nMr. Chamberlain, Lord Randolph Churchill, fortified the resolution of a\r\npopulace that came more and more to regard themselves as a bulwark of\r\nthe Empire, on whom destiny, while conferring on them the honour of\r\nupholding the flag, had imposed the duty of putting into actual practice\r\nthe familiar motto of the Orange Lodges--\"No surrender.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a psychology so bred and nourished sprang a political temper which,\r\nas it hardened with the passing years, appeared to English Home Rulers\r\nto be \"stiff-necked,\" \"bigoted,\" and \"intractable.\" It certainly was a\r\nstate of mind very different from those shifting gusts of transient\r\nimpression which in England go by the name of public opinion; and, if\r\nthese epithets in the mouths of opponents be taken as no more than\r\nsynonyms for \"uncompromising,\" they were not undeserved. At a memorable\r\nmeeting at the Albert Hall in London on the 22nd of April, 1893, Dr.\r\nAlexander, Bishop of Derry, poet, orator, and divine, declared in an\r\neloquent passage that was felt to be the exact expression of Ulster\r\nconviction, that the people of Ulster, when exhorted to show confidence\r\nin their southern fellow-countrymen, \"could no more be confiding about\r\nits liberty than a pure woman can be confiding about her honour.\"\r\n\r\nHere was the irreconcilable division. The Nationalist talked of\r\ncenturies of \"oppression,\" and demanded the dissolution of the Union in\r\nthe name of liberty. The Ulsterman, while far from denying the\r\nmisgovernment of former times, knew that it was the fruit of false ideas\r\nwhich had passed away, and that the Ireland in which he lived enjoyed as\r\nmuch liberty as any land on earth; and he feared the loss of the true\r\nliberty he had gained if put back under a regime of Nationalist and\r\nUtramontane domination. And so for more than thirty years the people of\r\nUlster for whom Bishop Alexander spoke made good his words. If in the\r\nend compromise was forced upon them it was not because their standpoint\r\nhad changed, and it was only in circumstances which involved no\r\ndishonour, and which preserved them from what they chiefly dreaded,\r\nsubjection to a Dublin Parliament inspired by clericalism and disloyalty\r\nto the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe development which brought about the change from Ulster's resolute\r\nstand for unimpaired union with Great Britain to her reluctant\r\nacceptance of a separate local constitution for the predominantly\r\nProtestant portion of the Province, presents a deeply interesting\r\nillustration of the truth of a pregnant dictum of Maine's on the working\r\nof democratic institutions.\r\n\r\n\"Democracies,\" he says, \"are quite paralysed by the plea of nationality.\r\nThere is no more effective way of attacking them than by admitting the\r\nright of the majority to govern, but denying that the majority so\r\nentitled is the particular majority which claims the right.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what occurred in regard to Ulster's relation to Great\r\nBritain and to the rest of Ireland respectively. The will of the\r\nmajority must prevail, certainly. But what majority? Unionists\r\nmaintained that only the majority in the United Kingdom could decide,\r\nand that it had never in fact decided in favour of repealing the Act of\r\nUnion; Lord Rosebery at one time held that a majority in Great Britain\r\nalone, as the \"Predominant Partner,\" must first give its consent; Irish\r\nNationalists argued that the majority in Ireland, as a distinct unit,\r\nwas the only one that should count. Ulster, whilst agreeing with the\r\ngeneral Unionist position, contended ultimately that her own majority\r\nwas as well entitled to be heard in regard to her own fate as the\r\nmajority in Ireland as a whole. To the Nationalist claim that Ireland\r\nwas a nation she replied that it was either two nations or none, and\r\nthat if one of the two had a right to \"self-determination,\" the other\r\nhad it equally. Thus the axiom of democracy that government is by the\r\nmajority was, as Maine said, \"paralysed by the plea of nationality,\"\r\nsince the contending parties appealed to the same principle without\r\nhaving any common ground as to how it should be applied to the case in\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\nIf the Union with Great Britain was to be abrogated, which Pitt had only\r\nestablished when \"a full measure of Home Rule\" had produced a bloody\r\ninsurrection and Irish collusion with England's external enemies, Ulster\r\ncould at all events in the last resort take her stand on Abraham\r\nLincoln's famous proposition which created West Virginia: \"A minority of\r\na large community who make certain claims for self-government cannot, in\r\nlogic or in substance, refuse the same claims to a much larger\r\nproportionate minority among themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe Loyalists of Ulster were successful in holding this second line,\r\nwhen the first was no longer tenable; but they only retired from the\r\nfirst line--the maintenance of the legislative union--after a long and\r\nobstinate defence which it is the purpose of the following pages to\r\nrelate.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Henry Edward Manning_, by Shane Leslie, p. 406.\r\n\r\n[2] Sir S.H. Maine, _Popular Government_, p. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTORATE AND HOME RULE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe profess to be a democratic country in which the \"will of the people\"\r\nis the ultimate authority in determining questions of policy, and the\r\nLiberal Party has been accustomed to regard itself as the most zealous\r\nguardian of democratic principles. Yet there is this curious paradox in\r\nrelation to the problem which more than any other taxed British\r\nstatesmanship during the thirty-five years immediately following the\r\nenfranchisement of the rural democracy in 1884, that the solution\r\npropounded by the Liberal Party, and inscribed by that party on the\r\nStatute-book in 1914, was more than once emphatically rejected, and has\r\nnever been explicitly accepted by the electorate.\r\n\r\nNo policy ever submitted to the country was more decisively condemned at\r\nthe polls than Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule proposals in the General\r\nElection of 1886. The issue then for the first time submitted to the\r\npeople was isolated from all others with a completeness scarcely ever\r\npracticable--a circumstance which rendered the \"mandate\" to Parliament\r\nto maintain the legislative union exceptionally free from ambiguity. The\r\nparty which had brought forward the defeated proposal, although led by a\r\nstatesman of unrivalled popularity, authority, and power, was shattered\r\nin the attempt to carry it, and lost the support of numbers of its most\r\nconspicuous adherents, including Chamberlain, Hartington, Goschen, and\r\nJohn Bright, besides a multitude of its rank and file, who entered into\r\npolitical partnership with their former opponents in order to withstand\r\nthe new departure of their old Chief.\r\n\r\nThe years that followed were a period of preparation by both sides for\r\nthe next battle. The improvement in the state of Ireland, largely the\r\nresult of legislation carried by Lord Salisbury's Government, especially\r\nthat which promoted land purchase, encouraged the confidence felt by\r\nUnionists that the British voter would remain staunch to the Union. The\r\ndownfall of Parnell in 1890, followed by the break-up of his party, and\r\nby his death in the following year, seemed to make the danger of Home\r\nRule still more remote. The only disquieting factor was the personality\r\nof Mr. Gladstone, which, the older he grew, exercised a more and more\r\nincalculable influence on the public mind. And there can be no doubt\r\nthat it was this personal influence that made him, in spite of his\r\npolicy, and not because of it, Prime Minister for the fourth time in\r\n1892. In Great Britain the electors in that year pronounced against Home\r\nRule again by a considerable majority, and it was only by coalition with\r\nthe eighty-three Irish Nationalist Members that Gladstone and his party\r\nwere able to scrape up a majority of forty in support of his second Home\r\nRule Bill. Whether there was any ground for Gladstone's belief that but\r\nfor the O'Shea divorce he would have had a three-figure majority in 1892\r\nis of little consequence, but the fall of his own majority in Midlothian\r\nfrom 4,000 to below 700, which caused him \"intense chagrin,\"[3] does not\r\nlend it support. Lord Morley says Gladstone was blamed by some of his\r\nfriends for accepting office \"depending on a majority not large enough\r\nto coerce the House of Lords\"[4]; but a more valid ground of censure was\r\nthat he was willing to break up the constitution of the United Kingdom,\r\nalthough a majority of British electors had just refused to sanction\r\nsuch a thing being done. That Gladstone's colleagues realised full well\r\nthe true state of public opinion on the subject, if he himself did not,\r\nwas shown by their conduct when the Home Rule Bill, after being carried\r\nthrough the House of Commons by diminutive majorities, was rejected on\r\nsecond reading by the Peers. Even their great leader's entreaty could\r\nnot persuade them to consent to an appeal to the people[5]; and when\r\nthey were tripped up over the cordite vote in 1895, after Gladstone had\r\ndisappeared from public life, none of them probably were surprised at\r\nthe overwhelming vote by which the constituencies endorsed the action of\r\nthe House of Lords, and pronounced for the second time in ten years\r\nagainst granting Home Rule to Ireland.\r\n\r\nIf anything except the personal ascendancy of Gladstone contributed to\r\nhis small coalition majority in 1892 it was no doubt the confidence of\r\nthe electors that the House of Lords could be relied upon to prevent the\r\npassage of a Home Rule Bill. It is worth noting that nearly twenty years\r\nlater Lord Crewe acknowledged that the Home Rule Bill of 1893 could not\r\nhave stood the test of a General Election or of a Referendum.[6]\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years of Unionist Government from 1895 to 1905 the\r\nquestion of Home Rule slipped into the background. Other issues, such as\r\nthose raised by the South African War and Mr. Chamberlain's tariff\r\npolicy, engrossed the public mind. English Home Rulers showed a\r\ndisposition to hide away, if not to repudiate altogether, the legacy\r\nthey had inherited from Gladstone. Lord Rosebery acknowledged the\r\nnecessity to convert \"the predominant partner,\" a mission which every\r\npassing year made appear a more hopeless undertaking. At by-elections\r\nHome Rule was scarcely mentioned. In the eyes of average Englishmen the\r\nquestion was dead and buried, and most people were heartily thankful to\r\nhear no more about it. Mr. T.M. Healy's caustic wit remarked that \"Home\r\nRule was put into cold storage.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThen came the great overthrow of the Unionists in 1906. Home Rule,\r\nexcept by its absence from Liberal election addresses, contributed\r\nnothing at all to that resounding Liberal victory. The battle of\r\n\"terminological inexactitudes\" rang with cries of Chinese \"slavery,\"\r\nTariff Reform, Church Schools, Labour Dispute Bills, and so forth; but\r\non Ireland silence reigned on the platforms of the victors. The event\r\nwas to give the successors of Mr. Gladstone a House of Commons in\r\ncomplete subjection to them. For the first time since 1885 they had a\r\nmajority independent of the Nationalists, a majority, if ever there was\r\none, \"large enough to coerce the House of Lords,\" as they would have\r\ndone in 1893, according to Lord Morley, if they had had the power. But\r\nto do that would involve the danger of having again to appeal to the\r\ncountry, which even at this high tide of Liberal triumph they could not\r\nface with Home Rule as an election cry. So, with the tame acquiescence\r\nof Mr. Redmond and his followers, they spent four years of unparalleled\r\npower without laying a finger on Irish Government, a course which was\r\nrendered easy for them by the fact that, on their own admission, they\r\nhad found Ireland in a more peaceful, prosperous, and contented\r\ncondition than it had enjoyed for several generations. Occasionally,\r\nindeed, as was necessary to prevent a rupture with the Nationalists,\r\nsome perfunctory mention of Home Rule as a _desideratum_ of the future\r\nwas made on Ministerial platforms--by Mr. Churchill, for example, at\r\nManchester in May 1909. But by that date even the contest over Tariff\r\nReform--which had raged without intermission for six years, and by\r\nrending the Unionist Party had grievously damaged it as an effective\r\ninstrument of opposition--had become merged in the more immediately\r\nexciting battle of the Budget, provoked by Mr. Lloyd George's financial\r\nproposals for the current year, and by the possibility that they might\r\nbe rejected by the House of Lords. This the House of Lords did, on the\r\n30th of November, 1909, and the Prime Minister at once announced that he\r\nwould appeal to the country without delay.\r\n\r\nSuch a turn of events was a wonderful windfall for the Irish\r\nNationalists, beyond what the most sanguine of them can ever have hoped\r\nfor. The rejection of a money Bill by the House of Lords raised a\r\ndemocratic blizzard, the full force of which was directed against the\r\nconstitutional power of veto possessed by the hereditary Chamber in\r\nrelation not merely to money Bills, but to general legislation. For a\r\nlong time the Liberal Party had been threatening that part of the\r\nConstitution without much effect. Sixteen years had passed since Mr.\r\nGladstone in his last speech in the House of Commons declared that\r\nissue must be joined with the Peers; but the emphatic endorsement by the\r\nconstituencies in 1895 of the Lords' action which he had denounced,\r\nfollowed by ten years of Unionist Government, damped down the ardour of\r\nattack so effectually that, during the four years in which the Liberals\r\nenjoyed unchallengeable power, from 1906 to 1910, they did nothing to\r\ncarry out Gladstone's parting injunction. Had they done so at any time\r\nwhen Home Rule was a living issue in the country an attack on the Lords\r\nwould in all probability have proved disastrous to themselves. For there\r\nwas not a particle of evidence that the electors of Great Britain had\r\nchanged their minds on this subject, and there were great numbers of\r\nvoters in the country--those voters, unattached to party, who constitute\r\n\"the swing of the pendulum,\" and decide the issue at General\r\nElections--who felt free to vote Liberal in 1906 because they believed\r\nHome Rule was practically dead, and if revived would be again given its\r\n_quietus_, as in 1893, by the House of Lords. But the defeat of the\r\nBudget in November 1909 immediately opened a line of attack wholly\r\nunconnected with Ireland, and over the most favourable ground that could\r\nhave been selected for the assault.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been more skilful than the tactics employed by the\r\nLiberal leaders. Concentrating on the constitutional question raised by\r\nthe alleged encroachment of the Lords on the exclusive privilege of the\r\nCommons to grant supply, they tried to excite a hurricane of popular\r\nfury by calling on the electorate to decide between \"Peers and People.\"\r\nThe rejected Finance Bill was dubbed \"The People's Budget.\" A \"Budget\r\nLeague\" was formed to expatiate through the constituencies on the\r\ndemocratic character of its provisions, and on the personal and class\r\nselfishness of the Peers in throwing it out. As little as possible was\r\nsaid about Ireland, and probably not one voter in ten thousand who went\r\nto the poll in January 1910 ever gave a thought to the subject, or\r\ndreamed that he was taking part in reversing the popular verdict of 1886\r\nand 1895. Afterwards, when it was complained that an election so\r\nconducted had provided no \"mandate\" for Home Rule, it was found that in\r\nthe course of a long speech delivered by Mr. Asquith at the Albert Hall\r\non the 10th of December there was a sentence in which the Prime Minister\r\nhad declared that \"the Irish problem could only be solved by a policy\r\nwhich, while explicitly safeguarding the supreme authority of the\r\nImperial Parliament, would set up self-government in Ireland in regard\r\nto Irish affairs.\" The rest of the speech dealt with Tariff Reform and\r\nwith the constitutional question of the House of Lords, on which the\r\npublic mind was focused throughout the election.\r\n\r\nIn the unprecedented deluge of oratory that flooded the country in the\r\nmonth preceding the elections the Prime Minister's sentence on Ireland\r\nat the Albert Hall passed almost unnoticed in English and Scottish\r\nconstituencies, or was quickly lost sight of, like a coin in a\r\ncornstack, under sheaves of rhetoric about the dear loaf and the\r\nintolerable arrogance of hereditary legislators. Here and there a\r\nUnionist candidate did his best to warn a constituency that every\r\nLiberal vote was a vote for Home Rule. He was invariably met with an\r\nimpatient retort that he was attempting to raise a bogey to divert\r\nattention from the iniquity of the Lords and the Tariff Reformers. Home\r\nRule, he was told, was dead and buried.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of January, 1910, when the elections were over in the\r\nboroughs, Mr. Asquith claimed that \"the great industrial centres had\r\nmainly declared for Free Trade,\" and the impartial chronicler of the\r\n_Annual Register_ stated that \"the Liberals had fought on Free Trade and\r\nthe constitutional issue.\" The twice-repeated decision of the country\r\nagainst Home Rule for Ireland was therefore in no sense reversed by the\r\nGeneral Election of January 1910.\r\n\r\nBut from the very beginning of the agitation over the Budget and the\r\naction of the House of Lords in relation to it, in the summer of 1909,\r\nthe gravity of the situation so created was fully appreciated by both\r\npolitical parties in Ireland itself. Only the most languid interest was\r\nthere taken in the questions which stirred the constituencies across\r\nthe Channel. Neither Nationalist nor Unionist cared anything whatever\r\nfor Free Trade; neither of them shed a tear over the rejected Budget.\r\nIndeed, Mr. Lloyd George's new taxes were so unpopular in Ireland that\r\nMr. Redmond was violently attacked by Mr. William O'Brien and Mr. Healy\r\nfor his neglect of obvious Irish interests in supporting the Government.\r\nMr. Redmond, for his part, made no pretence that his support was given\r\nbecause he approved of the proposals for which he and his followers gave\r\ntheir votes in every division. The clauses of the Finance Bill were\r\ntrifles in his eyes that did not matter. His gaze was steadily fixed on\r\nthe House of Peers, which he saw before him as a huntsman views a fox\r\nwith bedraggled brush, reduced to a trot a field or two ahead of the\r\nhounds. That House was, as he described it, \"the last obstacle to Home\r\nRule,\" and he was determined to do all he could to remove the obstacle.\r\nLord Rosebery said at Glasgow in September 1909 that he believed\r\nMinisters wanted the House of Lords to reject the Budget. Whether they\r\ndid or not, there can be no doubt that Mr. Redmond did, for he knew\r\nthat, in that event, the whole strength of the Liberal Party would be\r\ndirected to the task of beating down the \"last obstacle,\" and that then\r\nit would be possible to carry Home Rule without the British\r\nconstituencies being consulted. It was with this end in view that he\r\ntook his party into the lobby in support of a Budget that was detested\r\nin Ireland, and threw the whole weight of his influence in British\r\nconstituencies on to the Liberal side in the elections of January 1910.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding the torrent of class prejudice and democratic\r\npassion that was stirred up by six weeks of Liberal oratory, the result\r\nof the elections was a serious loss of strength to the Government. The\r\ncommanding Liberal majority of 1906 over all parties in the House of\r\nCommons disappeared, and Mr. Asquith and his Cabinet were once more\r\ndependent on a coalition of Labour Members and Nationalists. The\r\nLiberals by themselves had a majority of two only over the Unionists,\r\nwho had won over one hundred seats, so that the Nationalists were\r\neasily in a position to enforce their leader's threat to make Mr.\r\nAsquith \"toe the line.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Parliament elected in January 1910 assembled disputes arose\r\nbetween the Government and the Nationalists as to whether priority was\r\nto be given to passing the Budget rejected in the previous session, or\r\nto the Parliament Bill which was to deprive the House of Lords of its\r\nconstitutional power to reject legislation passed by the Commons; and\r\nMr. Redmond expressed his displeasure that \"guarantees\" had not yet been\r\nobtained from the King, or, in plain language, that a promise had not\r\nbeen extorted from the Sovereign that he would be prepared to create a\r\nsufficient number of Peers to secure the acceptance of the Parliament\r\nBill by the Upper House.\r\n\r\nThe whole situation was suddenly changed by the death of King Edward in\r\nMay 1910. Consideration for the new and inexperienced Sovereign led to\r\nthe temporary abandonment of coercion of the Crown, and resort was had\r\nto a Conference of party leaders, with a view to settlement of the\r\ndispute by agreement. But no agreement was arrived at, and the\r\nConference broke up on the 10th of November. Parliament was again\r\ndissolved in December, \"on the assumption,\" as Lord Crewe stated, \"that\r\nthe House of Lords would reject the Parliament Bill.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the agitation of this troubled autumn preceding the General\r\nElection, the question of Home Rule was not quite so successfully\r\nconcealed from view as in the previous year. The Liberals, indeed,\r\nmaintained the same tactical reserve on the subject, alike in their\r\nwritings and their speeches. The Liberal Press of the period may be\r\nsearched in vain for any clear indication that the electors were about\r\nto be asked to decide once more this momentous constitutional question.\r\nSuch mention of it as was occasionally to be found in ministerial\r\nspeeches seemed designed to convey the idea that, while the door leading\r\nto Home Rule was still formally open, there was no immediate prospect of\r\nits being brought into use. The Prime Minister in particular did\r\neverything in his power to direct the attention of the country to the\r\nsame issues as in the preceding January, among which Ireland had had no\r\nplace. In presenting the Government's case at Hull on the 25th of\r\nNovember, he reminded the country that in the January elections the veto\r\nof the Peers was \"the dominant issue\"; in the intervening months the\r\nGovernment, he said, had brought forward proposals for dealing with the\r\nveto, and had given the Lords an opportunity to make proposals of their\r\nown; a defeat of the Liberals in the coming elections would bring in\r\n\"Protection disguised as Tariff Reform\"; but he (Mr. Asquith) preferred\r\nto concentrate his criticism on Lord Lansdowne's \"crude and complex\r\nscheme\" for Second Chamber reform; he made a passing mention of\r\n\"self-government for Ireland\" as a policy that would have the sympathy\r\nof the Dominions, but added that \"the immediate task was to secure fair\r\nplay for Liberal legislation and popular government.\" And in his\r\nelection address Mr. Asquith declared that \"the appeal to the country\r\nwas almost narrowed to a single issue, and on its determination hung the\r\nwhole future of democratic Government.\"\r\n\r\nThis zeal for \"popular,\" or \"democratic\" government was, however, not\r\ninconsistent apparently with a determination to avoid at all hazards\r\nconsulting the will of the people, before doing what the people had\r\nhitherto always refused to sanction. The suggestion had been made\r\nearlier in the autumn that a Referendum, or \"Poll of the People\" might\r\nbe taken on the question of Home Rule. The very idea filled the Liberals\r\nwith dismay. Speaking at Edinburgh on the 2nd of December, Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, made the curiously naive\r\nadmission, for a \"democratic\" politician, that the Referendum would\r\namount to \"a prohibitive tariff against Liberalism.\" A few days earlier\r\nat Reading (November 29th) his Chief sought to turn the edge of this\r\ndisconcerting proposal by asking whether the Unionists, if returned to\r\npower, would allow Tariff Reform to be settled by the same mode of\r\nappeal to the country; and when Mr. Balfour promptly accepted the\r\nchallenge by promising that he would do so Mr. Asquith retreated under\r\ncover of the excuse that no bargain had been intended.\r\n\r\nWhile the Liberal leaders were thus doing all they could to hold down\r\nthe lid of the Home Rule Jack-in-the-box, the Unionists were warning the\r\ncountry that as soon as Mr. Asquith secured a majority his thumb would\r\nrelease the spring. Speakers from Ulster carried the warning into many\r\nconstituencies, but it was noticed that they were constantly met with\r\nthe same retort as in January--that Home Rule was a \"bogey,\" or a \"red\r\nherring\" dragged across the trail of Tariff Reform and the Peers' veto;\r\nand it is a significant indication of the straits to which the\r\nGovernment afterwards felt themselves driven to find justification for\r\ndealing with so fundamental a question as the repeal of the Union\r\nwithout the explicit approval of the electorate, that they devised the\r\nstrange doctrine that speeches by their opponents provided them with a\r\nmandate for a policy about which they had themselves kept silence, even\r\nalthough those speeches had been disbelieved and derided on the very\r\nground that it would be impossible for Ministers to bring forward a\r\npolicy they had not laid before the country during the election.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which this ministerial reserve was carried was shown by a\r\nquestion put to Mr. Asquith in his own constituency in East Fife on the\r\n6th of December. Scottish \"hecklers\" are intelligent and well informed\r\non current politics, and no one who knows them can imagine one of them\r\nasking the Prime Minister whether he intended to introduce a Home Rule\r\nBill if Home Rule had been proclaimed as one of the chief items in the\r\npolicy of the Government. Mr. Asquith gave an affirmative reply; but the\r\nelections were by this time half over, and in the following week Mr.\r\nBalfour laid stress on the fact that five hundred contests had been\r\ndecided before any Minister had mentioned Home Rule. Even after giving\r\nthis memorable answer in East Fife Mr. Asquith, speaking at Bury St.\r\nEdmunds on the 12th of December, declared that \"the sole issue at that\r\nmoment was the supremacy of the people,\" and he added, in deprecation of\r\nall the talk about Ireland, that \"it was sought to confuse this issue by\r\ncatechising Ministers on the details of the next Home Rule Bill.\"\r\n\r\nEven if this had been, as it was not, a true description of the\r\nattempts that had been made to extract a frank declaration from the\r\nGovernment as to their intentions in regard to this vitally important\r\nmatter--far more important to hundreds of thousands of people than any\r\nquestion of Tariff, or of limiting the functions of the Second Chamber\r\n--it was surely a curious doctrine to be propounded by a statesman\r\nzealous to preserve \"popular government \"! There had been two Home Rule\r\nBills in the past, differing one from the other in not a few important\r\nrespects; discussion had shown that many even of those who supported the\r\nprinciple of Home Rule objected strongly to this or that proposal for\r\nembodying it in legislation Language had been used by Mr. Asquith\r\nhimself, as well as by some of his principal colleagues, which implied\r\nthat any future Home Rule Bill would be part of a general scheme of\r\n\"devolution,\" or federation, or \"Home Rule All Round\"--a solution of the\r\nquestion favoured by many who hotly opposed separate treatment for\r\nIreland Yet here was the responsible Minister, in the middle of a\r\nGeneral Election, complaining that the issue was being \"confused\" by\r\npresumptuous persons who wanted to know what sort of Home Rule, if any,\r\nhe had in contemplation in the event of obtaining a majority sufficient\r\nto keep him in power.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it would have been a straining of\r\nconstitutional principles, and a flagrant violation of the canons of\r\nthat \"democratic government\" of which Mr Asquith had constituted himself\r\nthe champion, to pass a Home Rule Bill by means of a majority so\r\nobtained, even if the majority had been one that pointed to a sweeping\r\nturnover of public opinion to the side of the Government The elections\r\nof December 1910, in point of fact, gave no such indication. The\r\nGovernment gained nothing whatever by the appeal to the country.\r\nLiberals and Unionists came back in almost precisely the same strength\r\nas in the previous Parliament. They balanced each other within a couple\r\nof votes in the new House of Commons, and the Ministry could not have\r\nremained twenty-four hours in office except in coalition with Labour and\r\nthe Irish Nationalists.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament so elected and so constituted was destined not merely to\r\ndestroy the effective power of the House of Lords, and to place on the\r\nStatute-book a measure setting up an Irish Parliament in Dublin, but to\r\nbe an assembly longer in duration and more memorable in achievement than\r\nany in English history since the Long Parliament. During the eight years\r\nof its reign the Great War was fought and won; the \"rebel party\" in\r\nIreland once more, as in the Napoleonic Wars, broke into armed\r\ninsurrection in league with the enemies of England; and before it was\r\ndissolved the political parties in Great Britain, heartily supported by\r\nthe Loyalists of Ulster, composed the party differences which had raged\r\nwith such passion over Home Rule and other domestic issues, and joined\r\nforces in patriotic resistance to the foreign enemy.\r\n\r\nBut before this transformation took place nearly four years of agitation\r\nand contest had to run their course. In the first session of the\r\nParliament, by a violent use of the Royal Prerogative, the Parliament\r\nBill became law, the Peers accepting the measure under duress of the\r\nthreat that some four or five hundred peerages would, if necessary, be\r\ncreated to form a majority to carry it. It was then no longer possible\r\nfor the Upper House to force an appeal to the country on Home Rule, as\r\nit had done in 1893. All that was necessary was for a Bill to be carried\r\nin three successive sessions through the House of Commons, to become\r\nlaw. \"The last obstacle to Home Rule,\" as Mr. Redmond called it, had\r\nbeen removed. The Liberal Government had taken a hint from the procedure\r\nof the careful burglar, who poisons the dog before breaking into the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the manner in which the Irish question had been kept\r\nout of view of the electorate by the Government and their supporters was\r\nnot lost upon the people of Ulster. In January 1911, within a month of\r\nthe elections, a meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council was held at\r\nwhich a comprehensive resolution dealing with the situation that had\r\narisen was adopted, and published as a manifesto. One of its clauses\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n     \"The Council has observed with much surprise the singular reticence\r\n     as regards Home Rule maintained by a large number of Radical\r\n     candidates in England and Scotland during the recent elections, and\r\n     especially by the Prime Minister himself, who barely referred to\r\n     the subject till almost the close of his own contest. In view of\r\n     the consequent fact that Home Rule was not at the late appeal to\r\n     the country placed as a clear issue before the electors, it is the\r\n     judgment of the Council that the country has given no mandate for\r\n     Home Rule, and that any attempt in such circumstances to force\r\n     through Parliament a measure enacting it would be for His Majesty's\r\n     Ministers a grave, if not criminal, breach of constitutional duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe great importance, in relation to the policy subsequently pursued by\r\nUlster, of the historical fact here made clear--namely, that the \"will\r\nof the people\" constitutionally expressed in parliamentary elections has\r\nnever declared itself in favour of granting Home Rule to Ireland, lies,\r\nfirst, in the justification it afforded to the preparations for active\r\nresistance to a measure so enacted; and, secondly, in the influence it\r\nhad in procuring for Ulster not merely the sympathy but the open support\r\nof the whole Unionist Party in Great Britain. Lord Londonderry, one of\r\nUlster's most trusted leaders, who afterwards gave the whole weight of\r\nhis support to the policy of forcible resistance, admitted in the House\r\nof Lords in 1911, in the debates on the Parliament Bill, that the\r\nverdict of the country, if appealed to, would have to be accepted. The\r\nleader of the Unionist Party, Mr. Bonar Law, made it clear in February\r\n1914, as he had more than once stated before, that the support he and\r\nhis party were pledging themselves to give to Ulster in the struggle\r\nthen approaching a climax, was entirely due to the fact that the\r\nelectorate had never sanctioned the policy of the Government against\r\nwhich Ulster's resistance was threatened. The chance of success in that\r\nresistance \"depended,\" he said, \"upon the sympathy of the British\r\npeople, and an election would undoubtedly make a great difference in\r\nthat respect\"; he denied that Mr. Asquith had a \"right to pass any form\r\nof Home Rule without a mandate from the people of this country, which\r\nhe has never received\"; and he categorically announced that \"if you get\r\nthe decision of the people we shall obey it.\" And if, as then appeared\r\nlikely, the unconstitutional conduct of the Government should lead to\r\nbloodshed in Ireland, the responsibility, said Mr. Bonar Law, would be\r\ntheirs, \"because you preferred to face civil war rather than face the\r\npeople.\"[8]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Morley's _Life of Gladstone_, in, 492.\r\n\r\n[4] Ibid., 493.\r\n\r\n[5] Ibid., 505.\r\n\r\n[6] _Annual Register_, 1910, p. 240.\r\n\r\n[7] See _Letters to Isabel_, by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline, p. 130.\r\n\r\n[8] _Parliamentary Debates_ (5th Series), vol. I viii, pp. 279-84.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nORGANISATION AND LEADERSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the day when Gladstone first made Home Rule for Ireland the leading\r\nissue in British politics, the Loyalists of Ulster--who, as already\r\nexplained, included practically all the Protestant population of the\r\nProvince both Conservative and Liberal, besides a small number of\r\nCatholics who had no separatist sympathies--set to work to organise\r\nthemselves for effective opposition to the new policy. In the hour of\r\ntheir dismay over Gladstone's surrender Lord Randolph Churchill,\r\nhurrying from London to encourage and inspirit them, told them in the\r\nUlster Hall on the 22nd of February, 1886, that \"the Loyalists in Ulster\r\nshould wait and watch--organise and prepare.\"[9] They followed his\r\nadvice. Propaganda among themselves was indeed unnecessary, for no one\r\nrequired conversion except those who were known to be inconvertible. The\r\nchief work to be done was to send speakers to British constituencies;\r\nand in the decade from 1885 to 1895 Ulster speakers, many of whom were\r\nministers of the different Protestant Churches, were in request on\r\nEnglish and Scottish platforms.\r\n\r\nA number of organisations were formed for this purpose, some of which,\r\nlike the Irish Unionist Alliance, represented Unionist opinion\r\nthroughout Ireland, and not in Ulster alone. Others were exclusively\r\nconcerned with the northern Province, where from the first the\r\nopposition was naturally more concentrated than elsewhere. In the early\r\ndays, the Ulster Loyalist and Patriotic Union, organised by Lord\r\nRanfurly and Mr. W.R. Young, carried on an active and sustained campaign\r\nin Great Britain, and the Unionist Clubs initiated by Lord Templetown\r\nprovided a useful organisation in the smaller country towns, which still\r\nexists as an effective force. The Loyal Orange Institution, founded at\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century to commemorate, and to keep alive the\r\nprinciples of, the Whig Revolution of 1688, had fallen into not\r\nunmerited disrepute prior to 1886. Few men of education or standing\r\nbelonged to it, and the lodge meetings and anniversary celebrations had\r\nbecome little better than occasions for conviviality wholly inconsistent\r\nwith the irreproachable formularies of the Order. But its system of\r\nlocal Lodges, affiliated to a Grand Lodge in each county, supplied the\r\nready-made framework of an effective organisation. Immediately after the\r\nintroduction of Gladstone's first Bill in 1886 it received an immense\r\naccession of strength. Large numbers of country gentlemen, clergymen of\r\nall Protestant denominations, business and professional men, farmers,\r\nand the better class of artisans in Belfast and other towns, joined the\r\nlocal Lodges, the management of which passed into capable hands; the\r\ncharacter of the Society was thereby completely and rapidly transformed,\r\nand, instead of being a somewhat disreputable and obsolete survival, it\r\nbecame a highly respectable as well as an exceedingly powerful political\r\norganisation, the whole weight of whose influence has been on the side\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\nA rallying cry was given to the Ulster Loyalists in the famous phrase\r\ncontained in a letter from Lord Randolph Churchill to a correspondent in\r\nMay 1886: \"Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right.\" From this time\r\nforward the idea that resort to physical resistance would be preferable\r\nto submission to a Parliament in Dublin controlled by the \"rebel party\"\r\ntook hold of the popular mind in Ulster, although after the elections of\r\n1886 there was no serious apprehension that the necessity would arise,\r\nuntil the return to power of Mr. Gladstone at the head of a small\r\nmajority in 1892 brought about a fresh crisis.\r\n\r\nThe work of organisation was then undertaken with greater energy and\r\nthoroughness than before. It was now that Lord Templetown founded the\r\nUnionist Clubs, which spread in an affiliated network through Ulster,\r\nand proved so valuable that, after falling into neglect during the ten\r\nyears of Conservative Government, they were revived at the special\r\nrequest of the Ulster Unionist Council in December 1910. Nothing,\r\nhowever, did so much to stimulate organisation and concentration of\r\neffort as the great Convention held in Belfast on the 19th of June 1892,\r\nrepresenting on a democratic basis all the constituencies in Ulster.\r\nNumerous preliminary meetings were arranged for the purpose of electing\r\nthe delegates; and of these the Special Correspondent of _The Times_\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     \"Nothing has struck me more in the present movement than the\r\n     perfect order and regularity with which the preliminary meetings\r\n     for the election of delegates has been conducted. From city and\r\n     town and village come reports of crowded and enthusiastic\r\n     gatherings, all animated by an equal ardour, all marked by the same\r\n     spirit of quiet determination. There has been no 'tall talk,' no\r\n     over-statement; the speeches have been dignified, sensible, and\r\n     practical. One of the most marked features in the meetings has been\r\n     the appearance of men who have never before taken part in public\r\n     life, who have never till now stood on a public platform. Now for\r\n     the first time they have broken with the tranquil traditions of a\r\n     lifetime, and have come forward to take their share and their\r\n     responsibility in the grave danger which threatens their\r\n     country.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThere being no building large enough to hold the delegates, numbering\r\nnearly twelve thousand, every one of whom was a registered voter\r\nappointed by the polling districts to attend the Convention, a pavilion,\r\nthe largest ever used for a political meeting in the kingdom, was\r\nspecially constructed close to the Botanical Gardens in Belfast. It\r\ncovered 33,000 square feet, and, owing to the enthusiasm of the workmen\r\nemployed on the building, it was erected (at a cost of over £3,000)\r\nwithin three weeks. It provided seating accommodation for 13,000 people,\r\nbut the number who actually gained admittance to the Convention was\r\nnearly 21,000, while outside an assemblage, estimated by the\r\ncorrespondent of _The Times_ at 300,000, was also addressed by the\r\nprincipal speakers.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of the proceedings with prayer, conducted by the\r\nPrimate of all Ireland and the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, set\r\na precedent which was extensively followed in later years throughout\r\nUlster, marking the spirit of seriousness which struck numerous\r\nobservers as characteristic of the Ulster Movement. The speakers were\r\nmen representative of all the varied interests of the Province---\r\nreligious, agricultural, commercial, and industrial--and among them were\r\ntwo men, Mr. Thomas Sinclair and Mr. Thomas Andrews, who had been\r\nlife-long Liberals, but who from this time forward were distinguished\r\nand trusted leaders of Unionist opinion in Ulster. It was Mr. Andrews\r\nwho touched a chord that vibrated through the vast audience, making them\r\nleap to their feet, cheering for several minutes. \"As a last resource,\"\r\nhe cried, \"we will be prepared to defend ourselves.\" But the climax of\r\nthis memorable assembly was reached when the chairman, the Duke of\r\nAbercorn, with upraised arm, and calling on the audience solemnly to\r\nrepeat the words one by one after him, gave out what became for the\r\nfuture the motto and watchword of Ulster loyalty: \"We will not have Home\r\nRule.\" It was felt that this simple negation constituted a solemn vow\r\ntaken by the delegates, both for themselves and for those they\r\nrepresented--an act of self-dedication to which every loyal man and\r\nwoman in Ulster was committed, and from which there could be no turning\r\nback.\r\n\r\nThe principal Resolution, adopted unanimously by the Convention,\r\nformulated the grounds on which the people of the Province based their\r\nhostility to the separatist policy of Home Rule; and as frequent\r\nreference was made to it in after-years as an authoritative definition\r\nof Ulster policy, it may be worth while to recall its terms:\r\n\r\n     \"That this Convention, consisting of 11,879 delegates representing\r\n     the Unionists of every creed, class, and party throughout Ulster,\r\n     appointed at public meetings held in every electoral division of\r\n     the Province, hereby solemnly resolves and declares: 'That we\r\n     express the devoted loyalty of Ulster Unionists to the Crown and\r\n     Constitution of the United Kingdom; that we avow our fixed resolve\r\n     to retain unchanged our present position as an integral portion of\r\n     the United Kingdom, and protest in the most unequivocal manner\r\n     against the passage of any measure that would rob us of our\r\n     inheritance in the Imperial Parliament, under the protection of\r\n     which our capital has been invested and our homes and rights\r\n     safeguarded; that we record our determination to have nothing to do\r\n     with a Parliament certain to be controlled by men responsible for\r\n     the crime and outrages of the Land League, the dishonesty of the\r\n     Plan of Campaign, and the cruelties of boycotting, many of whom\r\n     have shown themselves the ready instruments of clerical domination;\r\n     that we declare to the people of Great Britain our conviction that\r\n     the attempt to set up such a Parliament in Ireland will inevitably\r\n     result in disorder, violence, and bloodshed, such as have not been\r\n     experienced in this century, and announce our resolve to take no\r\n     part in the election or proceedings of such a Parliament, the\r\n     authority of which, should it ever be constituted, we shall be\r\n     forced to repudiate; that we protest against this great question,\r\n     which involves our lives, property, and civil rights, being treated\r\n     as a mere side-issue in the impending electoral struggle; that we\r\n     appeal to those of our fellow countrymen who have hitherto been in\r\n     favour of a separate Parliament to abandon a demand which\r\n     hopelessly divides Irishmen, and to unite with us under the\r\n     Imperial Legislature in developing the resources and furthering the\r\n     best interests of our common country.'\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Ulster Convention of 1892, and the\r\nnumerous less imposing demonstrations which followed on both sides of\r\nthe Channel and took their tone from it, of which the most notable was\r\nthe great meeting at the Albert Hall in London on the 22nd of April,\r\n1893, had much effect in impressing and instructing public opinion, and\r\nthus preparing the way for the smashing defeat of the Liberal Home Rule\r\nParty in the General Election of 1895. After that event vigilance again\r\nrelaxed during the ten years of Unionist predominance which followed.\r\nBut the organisation was kept intact, and its democratic method of\r\nappointing delegates in every polling district provided a permanent\r\nelectoral machinery for the Unionist Party in the constituencies, as\r\nwell as the framework for the Ulster Unionist Council, which was brought\r\ninto existence in 1905, largely through the efforts of Mr. William\r\nMoore, M.P. for North Armagh. This Council, with its executive Standing\r\nCommittee, was thenceforward the acknowledged authority for determining\r\nall questions of Unionist policy in Ulster.\r\n\r\nIts first meeting was held on the 3rd of March, 1905, under the\r\npresidency of Colonel James McCalmont, M.P. for East Antrim. The first\r\nten members of the Standing Committee were nominated by Colonel\r\nSaunderson, M.P., as chairman of the Ulster Parliamentary Party. They\r\nwere, in addition to the chairman himself, the Duke of Abercorn, the\r\nMarquis of Londonderry, the Earl of Erne, the Earl of Ranfurly, Colonel\r\nJames McCalmont, M.P., the Hon. R.T. O'Neill, M.P., Mr. G. Wolff, M.P.,\r\nMr. J.B. Lonsdale, M.P., and Mr. William Moore, K.C., M.P. These\r\nnominations were confirmed by a ballot of the members of the Council,\r\nand twenty other members were elected forthwith to form the Standing\r\nCommittee. This first Executive Committee of the organisation which for\r\nthe next fifteen years directed the policy of Ulster Unionism included\r\nseveral names that were from this time forward among the most prominent\r\nin the movement. There were the two eminent Liberals, Mr. Thomas\r\nSinclair and Mr. Thomas Andrews, and Mr. John Young, all three of whom\r\nwere members of the Irish Privy Council; Colonel R.H. Wallace, C.B., Mr.\r\nW.H.H. Lyons, and Sir James Stronge, leaders of the Orangemen; Colonel\r\nSharman-Crawford, Mr. E.M. Archdale, Mr. W.J. Allen, Mr. R.H. Reade, and\r\nSir William Ewart. Among several \"Unionist candidates for Ulster\r\nconstituencies\" who were at the same meeting co-opted to the Council, we\r\nfind the names of Captain James Craig and Mr. Denis Henry, K.C. The Duke\r\nof Abercorn accepted the position of President of the Council, and Mr.\r\nE.M. Archdale was elected chairman of the Standing Committee. Mr. T.H.\r\nGibson was appointed secretary. In October 1906 the latter resigned his\r\npost owing to failing health, and, on the motion of Mr. William Moore,\r\nM.P., Mr. Richard Dawson Bates, a solicitor practising in Belfast, was\r\n\"temporarily\" appointed to fill the vacancy. This temporary appointment\r\nwas never formally made permanent, but no question in regard to the\r\nsecretaryship was ever raised, for Mr. Bates performed the duties year\r\nafter year to the complete satisfaction of everyone connected with the\r\norganisation, and in a manner that earned the gratitude of all Ulster\r\nUnionists. The funds at the disposal of the Council in 1906 only enabled\r\na salary of £100 a year to be paid to the secretary--a salary that was\r\npurely nominal in the case of a professional gentleman of Mr. Bates's\r\nstanding; but the spirit in which he took up his duties was seen two\r\nyears later, when it was found that out of this salary he had himself\r\nbeen paying for clerical assistance; and then, of course, this matter\r\nwas properly adjusted, which the improved financial position of the\r\nCouncil happily rendered possible.\r\n\r\nThe declared purpose of the Ulster Unionist Council was to form a union\r\nof all local Unionist Associations in Ulster; to keep the latter in\r\nconstant touch with their parliamentary representatives; and \"to be the\r\nmedium of expressing Ulster Unionist opinion as current events may from\r\ntime to time require.\" It consisted at first of not more than 200\r\nmembers, of whom 100 represented local Associations, and 50 represented\r\nthe Orange Lodges, the remaining 50 being made up of Ulster members of\r\nboth Houses of Parliament and of certain \"distinguished residents in or\r\nnatives of Ulster\" to be co-opted by the Council. As time went on the\r\nCouncil was considerably enlarged, and its representative character\r\nimproved. In 1911 the elected membership was raised to 370, and included\r\nrepresentatives of local Associations, Orange Lodges, Unionist Clubs,\r\nand the Derry Apprentice Boys. In 1918 representatives of the Women's\r\nAssociations were added, and the total elected membership was increased\r\nto 432. The delegates elected by the various constituent bodies were in\r\nthe fullest sense representative men; they were drawn from all classes\r\nof the population; and, by the regularity with which they attended\r\nmeetings of the Council whenever business of any importance was to be\r\ntransacted, they made it the most effective political organisation in\r\nthe United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nA campaign of public meetings in England and Scotland conducted jointly\r\nby the Ulster Unionist Council and the Irish Unionist Alliance in 1908\r\nled to a scheme of co-operation between the two bodies, the one\r\nrepresenting Unionists in the North and the other those in the southern\r\nProvinces, which worked smoothly and effectively. A joint Committee of\r\nthe Unionist Associations of Ireland was therefore formed in the same\r\nyear, the organisations represented on it being the two already named\r\nand the Ulster Loyalist Anti-Repeal Union. The latter, which in earlier\r\nyears had done excellent spade-work under the fostering zeal of Lord\r\nRanfurly and Mr. William Robert Young, was before 1911 amalgamated with\r\nthe Unionist Council, so that all rivalry and overlapping was\r\nthenceforward eliminated from the organisation of Unionism in Ulster.\r\nThe Council in the North and the Irish Unionist Alliance in Dublin\r\nworked in complete harmony both with each other and with the Union\r\nDefence League in London, whose operations were carried on under the\r\ndirection of its founder, Mr. Walter Long.\r\n\r\nThe women of Ulster were scarcely less active than the men in the matter\r\nof organisation. Although, of course, as yet unenfranchised, they took\r\nas a rule a keener interest in political matters--meaning thereby the\r\none absorbing question of the Union--than their sex in other parts of\r\nthe United Kingdom. When critical times for the Union arrived there was,\r\ntherefore, no apathy to be overcome by the Protestant women in Ulster.\r\nEarly in 1911 the \"Ulster Women's Unionist Council\" was formed under the\r\npresidency of the Duchess of Abercorn, and very quickly became a most\r\neffective organisation side by side with that of the men. The leading\r\nspirit was the Marchioness of Londonderry, but that it was no\r\naristocratic affair of titled ladies may be inferred from the fact that\r\nwithin twelve months of its formation between forty and fifty thousand\r\nmembers were enrolled. A branch in Mr. Devlin's constituency of West\r\nBelfast, which over four thousand women joined in its first month of\r\nexistence, of whom over 80 per cent, were mill-workers and shop-girls in\r\nthe district, held a very effective demonstration on the 11th of\r\nJanuary, 1912, at which Mr. Thomas Sinclair, the most universally\r\nrespected of Belfast's business men, made one of his many telling\r\nspeeches which familiarised the people with the commercial and financial\r\naspects of Home Rule, as it would be felt in Ulster. The central Women's\r\nCouncil followed this up with a more imposing gathering in the Ulster\r\nHall on the 18th, which adopted with intense enthusiasm the declaration:\r\n\"We will stand by our husbands, our brothers, and our sons, in whatever\r\nsteps they may be forced to take in defending our liberties against the\r\ntyranny of Home Rule.\"\r\n\r\nThus before the end of 1911 men and women alike were firmly organised in\r\nUlster for the support of their loyalist principles. But the most\r\neffective organisation is impotent without leadership. Among the\r\ndeclared \"objects\" of the Ulster Unionist Council was that of acting \"as\r\na connecting link between Ulster Unionists and their parliamentary\r\nrepresentatives.\" In the House of Commons the Ulster Unionist Members,\r\nalthough they recognised Colonel Edward Saunderson, M.P., as their\r\nleader until his death in 1906, did not during his lifetime, or for some\r\nyears afterwards, constitute a separate party or group. When Colonel\r\nSaunderson died the Right Hon. Walter Long, who had held the office of\r\nChief Secretary in the last year of the Unionist Administration, and who\r\nhad been elected for South Dublin in 1906, became leader of the Irish\r\nUnionists--with whom those representing Ulster constituencies were\r\nincluded. But in the elections of January 1910 Mr. Long was returned for\r\na London seat, and it therefore became necessary for Irish Unionists to\r\nselect another leader.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Home Rule question had, as the people of Ulster\r\nperceived, become once more a matter of vital urgency, although, as\r\nexplained in the preceding chapter, the electors of Great Britain were\r\ntoo engrossed by other matters to give it a thought, and the Liberal\r\nMinisters were doing everything in their power to keep it in the\r\nbackground. The Ulster Members of the House of Commons realised,\r\ntherefore, the grave importance of finding a leader of the calibre\r\nnecessary for dealing on equal terms with such orators and\r\nParliamentarians as Mr. Asquith and Mr. John Redmond. They did not\r\ndeceive themselves into thinking that such a leader was to be found\r\namong their own number. They could produce several capable speakers, and\r\nmen of judgment and good sense; but something more was needed for the\r\ncritical times they saw ahead. After careful consideration, they took a\r\nstep which in the event proved to be of momentous importance, and of\r\nextreme good fortune, for the enterprise that the immediate future had\r\nin store for them. Mr. J.B. Lonsdale, Member for Mid Armagh, Hon.\r\nSecretary of the Irish Unionist Parliamentary Party, was deputed to\r\nrequest Sir Edward Carson, K.C., to accept the leadership of the Irish\r\nUnionist party in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nSeveral days elapsed before they received an answer; but when it came it\r\nwas, happily for Ulster, an acceptance. It is easy to understand Sir\r\nEdward Carson's hesitation before consenting to assume the leadership.\r\nAfter carrying all before him in the Irish Courts, where he had been Law\r\nOfficer of the Crown, he had migrated to London, where he had been\r\nSolicitor-General during the last six years of the Unionist\r\nAdministration, and by 1910 had attained a position of supremacy at the\r\nEnglish Bar, with the certain prospect of the highest legal advancement,\r\nand with an extremely lucrative practice, which his family circumstances\r\nmade it no light matter for him to sacrifice, but which he knew it would\r\nbe impossible for him to retain in conjunction with the political duties\r\nhe was now urged to undertake. Although only in his fifty-seventh year,\r\nhe was never one of those who feel younger than their age; nor did he\r\nminimise in his own mind the disability caused by his too frequent\r\nphysical ailments, which inclined him to shrink from embarking upon\r\nfresh work the extent and nature of which could not be exactly foreseen.\r\nAs to ambition, there are few men who ever were less moved by it, but he\r\ncould not leave altogether out of consideration his firm\r\nconviction--which ultimately proved to have been ill-founded--that\r\nacceptance of the Ulster leadership would cut him off from all\r\npromotion, whether political or legal.[11]\r\n\r\nMoreover, although for the moment it was the leadership of a\r\nparliamentary group to which he was formally invited, it was obvious\r\nthat much more was really involved; the people in Ulster itself needed\r\nguidance in the crisis that was visibly approaching. Ever since Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill, with the concurrence of Lord Salisbury, first\r\ninspired them in 1886 with the spirit of resistance in the last resort\r\nto being placed under a Dublin Parliament, and assured them of British\r\nsympathy and support if driven to that extremity, the determination of\r\nUlster in this respect was known to all who had any familiarity with the\r\ntemper of her people. Any man who undertook to lead them at such a\r\njuncture as had been reached in 1910 must make that determination the\r\nstarting-point of his policy. It was a task that would require not only\r\nstatesmanship, but political courage of a high order. Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill, in his famous Ulster Hall speech, had said that \"no\r\nportentous change such as the repeal of the Union, no change so\r\ngigantic, could be accomplished by the mere passing of a law; the\r\nhistory of the United States will teach us a different lesson.\" Ulster\r\nalways took her stand on the American precedent, though the exemplar was\r\nLincoln rather than Washington. But although the scale of operations\r\nwas, of course, infinitely smaller, the Ulster leader would, if it came\r\nto the worst, be confronted by certain difficulties from which Abraham\r\nLincoln was free. He might have to follow the example of the latter in\r\nforcibly resisting secession, but his legal position would be very\r\ndifferent. He might be called upon to resist technically legal\r\nauthority, whereas Lincoln had it at his back. To guide and control a\r\nheadstrong people, smarting under a sense of betrayal, when entering on\r\na movement pregnant with these issues, and at the same time to stand up\r\nagainst a powerful Government on the floor of the House of Commons, was\r\nan enterprise upon which any far-seeing man might well hesitate to\r\nembark.\r\n\r\nPondering over the invitation conveyed to him in his Chambers in the\r\nTemple, Carson may, therefore, well have asked himself what inducement\r\nthere was for him to accept it. He was not an Ulsterman. As a Southerner\r\nhe was not familiar with the psychology of the northern Irish; the\r\nsectarian narrowness popularly attributed to them outside their province\r\nwas wholly alien to his character; he was as far removed by nature from\r\na fire-eater as it was possible for man to be; he was not fond of\r\nunnecessary exertion; he preferred the law to politics, and disliked\r\naddressing political assemblies. In Parliament he represented, not a\r\npopular constituency, but the University of Dublin. But, on the other\r\nhand, he was to the innermost core of his nature an Irish Loyalist. His\r\nyouthful political sympathies had, indeed, been with the Liberal Party,\r\nbut he instantly severed his connection with it when Gladstone joined\r\nhands with Parnell. He had made his name at the Irish Bar as Crown\r\nProsecutor in the troubled period of Mr. Balfour's Chief Secretaryship,\r\nand this experience had bred in him a hearty detestation of the whining\r\nsentimentality, the tawdry and exaggerated rhetoric, and the\r\nmanufactured discontent that found vent in Nationalist politics. A\r\nsincere lover of Ireland, he had too much sound sense to credit the\r\nnotion that either the freedom or the prosperity of the country would be\r\nincreased by loosening the tie with Great Britain. Although he as yet\r\nknew little of Ulster, he admired her resolute stand for the Union, her\r\npassionate loyalty to the Crown; he watched with disgust the way in\r\nwhich her defences were being sapped by the Liberal Party in England;\r\nand the thought that such a people were perhaps on the eve of being\r\ndriven into subjection to the men whose character he had had so much\r\nopportunity to gauge in the days of the Land League filled him with\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, he could be of service in helping to avert so great a\r\nwrong Sir Edward Carson came to the conclusion that it would be shirking\r\na call of duty were he to decline the leadership that had been offered\r\nhim. Realising to the full all that it meant for himself--inevitable\r\nsacrifice of income, of ease, of chances of promotion, a burden of\r\nresponsibility, a probability of danger--he gave his consent; and the\r\nday he gave it--the 21st of February, 1910--should be marked for all\r\ntime as a red-letter day in the Ulster calendar.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] _Lord Randolph Churchill_, by the Right Hon. W.S. Churchill, vol.\r\nii, p. 62.\r\n\r\n[10] _The Times_, June 16th, 1892.\r\n\r\n[11] He expressed this conviction to the author in 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PARLIAMENT ACT: CRAIGAVON\r\n\r\n\r\nA good many months were to elapse before the Unionist rank and file in\r\nUlster were brought into close personal touch with the new leader of the\r\nIrish Unionist Parliamentary Party. The work to be done in 1910 lay\r\nchiefly in London, where the constitutional struggle arising out of the\r\nrejection of the \"People's Budget\" was raging. But shortly before the\r\nGeneral Election of December a demonstration was held in the Ulster Hall\r\nin Belfast, in the hope of opening the eyes of the English and Scottish\r\nelectors to the danger of Home Rule. Mr. Walter Long was the principal\r\nspeaker, and Sir Edward Carson, in supporting the resolution, ended his\r\nspeech by quoting Lord Randolph Churchill's famous jingling phrase,\r\n\"Ulster will fight, and Ulster will be right.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of January, 1911, when the elections were over, he went over\r\nfrom London to preside at an important meeting of the Ulster Unionist\r\nCouncil. The Annual Report of the Standing Committee, in welcoming his\r\nsuccession to Mr. Long in the leadership, spoke of his requiring no\r\nintroduction to Ulstermen; and it is true that he had occasionally\r\nspoken at meetings in Belfast, and that his recent speech in the Ulster\r\nHall had made an excellent impression. But he was not yet a really\r\nfamiliar figure even in Belfast, while outside the city he was\r\npractically unknown, except of course by repute. That a man of his\r\nsagacity would quickly make his weight felt was never in doubt; but few\r\nat that time can have anticipated the extent to which a stranger--with\r\nan accent proclaiming an origin south of the Boyne--was in a short time\r\nto captivate the hearts, and become literally the idolised leader, of\r\nthe Ulster democracy.\r\n\r\nFor the latter are a people who certainly do not wear their hearts on\r\ntheir sleeves for daws to peck at. In the eyes of the more volatile\r\nsouthern Celts they seem a \"dour\" people. They are naturally reserved,\r\nlaconic of speech, without \"gush,\" far from lavish in compliment, slow\r\nto commit themselves or to give their confidence without good and proved\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nOpportunity for the populace to get into closer touch with the leader\r\ndid not, however, come till the autumn. He was unable to attend the\r\nOrange celebration on the 12th of July, when the anniversary, which\r\npreceded by less than a month the \"removal of the last obstacle to Home\r\nRule\" by the passing of the Parliament Act, was kept with more than the\r\nusual fervour, and the speeches proved that the gravity of the situation\r\nwas fully appreciated. The Marquis of Londonderry, addressing an immense\r\nconcourse of Belfast Lodges, stated that it was the first time an\r\nEx-Viceroy had been present at an Orange gathering, but that he had\r\ndeliberately created the precedent owing to his sense of the danger\r\nthreatening the Loyalist cause.\r\n\r\nIt was the first of innumerable similar actions by which Lord\r\nLondonderry identified himself whole-heartedly with the popular\r\nmovement, throwing aside all the conventional restraints of rank and\r\nwealth, and thereby endearing himself to every man and woman in\r\nProtestant Ulster. There was no more familiar figure in the streets of\r\nBelfast. Barefooted street urchins, catching sight of him on the steps\r\nof the Ulster Club, would gather round and, with free-and-easy\r\nfamiliarity, shout \"Three cheers for Londonderry.\" He knew everybody and\r\nwas everybody's friend. There was no aristocratic hauteur or aloofness\r\nabout his genial personality. He was in the habit of entertaining the\r\nwhole Unionist Council, some five hundred strong, at luncheon or dinner\r\nas the occasion required, when important meetings of the delegates took\r\nplace. Distinguished political visitors from England could always be\r\ninvited over without thought for their entertainment, since a welcome at\r\nMount Stewart was never wanting. His financial support of the political\r\nmovement was equally open-handed.\r\n\r\nBut, helpful as were his hospitality and his subscriptions, it was the\r\ncountenance and support of a man who had held high Cabinet office, and\r\nespecially the great position of Viceroy of Ireland, that made Lord\r\nLondonderry's full participation an asset of incalculable value to the\r\ncause he espoused. Moreover, while he was always ready to cross the\r\nChannel, even if for a few hours only, when wanted for any conference or\r\npublic meeting, never pleading his innumerable social and political\r\nengagements in London or the North of England as an excuse for absence,\r\nhis natural modesty of character made it easy for him to act under the\r\nleadership of another. Indeed, he underrated his own abilities; but\r\nthere are probably not many men of his prominence and antecedents who,\r\nif similarly placed, would have been able to give, without a trace of\r\n_amour-propre,_ to a leader who had in former years been his own\r\nofficial subordinate, the consistently loyal backing that Lord\r\nLondonderry gave to Sir Edward Carson.\r\n\r\nBut, although there never was the slightest friction between the two\r\nmen, a difference of opinion between them on an important point showed\r\nitself within a few months of Carson's acceptance of the leadership. In\r\nJuly 1911 the excitement over the Parliament Bill reached its climax.\r\nWhen the Government announced that the King had given his assent to the\r\ncreation of whatever number of peerages might be required for carrying\r\nthe measure through the Upper House, the party known as \"Die Hards\" were\r\nfor rejecting it and taking the consequences; while against this policy\r\nwere ranged Lord Lansdowne, Lord Curzon, and other Unionist leaders, who\r\nadvocated the acceptance of the Bill under protest. On the 20th of July\r\nCarson told Lansdowne that in his judgment \"the disgrace and ignominy of\r\nsurrender on the question far outweighed any temporary advantage\" to be\r\ngained by the two years' delay of Home Rule which the Parliament Bill\r\nwould secure.[12] Lord Londonderry, on the other hand, supported the\r\nview taken by Lord Lansdowne, and he voted with the majority who carried\r\nthe Bill on the 10th of August. This step temporarily clouded his\r\npopularity in Ulster, but not many weeks passed before he completely\r\nregained the confidence and affection of the people, and the difference\r\nof opinion never in the smallest degree interrupted the harmony of his\r\nrelations with Sir Edward Carson.\r\n\r\nThe true position of affairs in relation to Home Rule had not yet been\r\ngrasped by the British public. As explained in a former chapter, it had\r\nnot been in any real sense an issue in the two General Elections of the\r\nprevious year, and throughout the spring and summer of 1911 popular\r\ninterest in England and Scotland was still wholly occupied with the\r\nfight between \"Peers and People\" and the impending blow to the power of\r\nthe Second Chamber; and the coronation festivities also helped to divert\r\nattention from the political consequences to which the authors of the\r\nParliament Bill intended it to lead.\r\n\r\nThe first real awakening was brought about by an immense demonstration\r\nheld at Craigavon, on the outskirts of Belfast, on the 23rd of\r\nSeptember. The main purpose of this historic gathering was to bring the\r\npopulace of Ulster face to face with their new leader, and to give him\r\nan opportunity of making a definite pronouncement of a policy for\r\nUlster, in view of the entirely novel situation resulting from the\r\npassing of the Parliament Act.\r\n\r\nFor that Act made it possible for the first time for the Liberal Home\r\nRule Party to repeal the Act of Union without an appeal to the country.\r\nIt enacted that any Bill which in three successive sessions was passed\r\nwithout substantial alteration through the House of Commons might be\r\npresented for the Royal Assent without the consent of the Lords; and an\r\namendment to exclude a Home Rule Bill from its operation had been\r\nsuccessfully resisted by the Government. It also reduced the maximum\r\nlegal duration of a Parliament from seven to five years; but the\r\nexisting Parliament was still in its first session, and there was\r\ntherefore ample time, under the provisions of the new Constitution, to\r\npass a Home Rule Bill before the next General Election, as the coalition\r\nof parties in favour of Home Rule constituted a substantial majority in\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe question, therefore, which the Ulster people had now to decide was\r\nno longer simply how they could bring about the rejection of a Home Rule\r\nBill by propaganda in the British constituencies, as they had hitherto\r\ndone with unfailing success, although that object was still kept in\r\nview, but what course they should adopt if a Home Rule Act should be\r\nplaced on the Statute-book without those constituencies being consulted.\r\nWas the day at last approaching when Lord Randolph Churchill's\r\nexhortation must be obeyed? Or were they to be compelled, because the\r\nCabinet had coerced the Sovereign and tricked the people by straining\r\nthe royal prerogative in a manner described by Mr. Balfour as \"a gross\r\nviolation of constitutional liberty,\" to submit with resignation to the\r\ngovernment of their country by the \"rebel party \"--the party controlled\r\nby clerical influence, and boasting of the identity of its aims with\r\nthose of Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet? This was the real problem in the\r\nminds of those who flocked to Craigavon on Saturday, the 23rd of\r\nSeptember, 1911, to hear what proposals Sir Edward Carson had to lay\r\nbefore his followers.\r\n\r\nCraigavon was the residence of Captain James Craig, Member of Parliament\r\nfor East Down. It is a spacious country house standing on a hill above\r\nthe road leading from Belfast to Holywood, with a fine view of Belfast\r\nLough and the distant Antrim coast beyond the estuary. The lawn in front\r\nof the house, sloping steeply to the shore road, forms a sort of natural\r\namphitheatre offering ideal conditions for out-of-door oratory to an\r\nunlimited audience. At the meeting on the 23rd of September the platform\r\nwas erected near the crest of the hill, enabling the vast audience to\r\nspread out fan-wise over the lower levels, where even the most distant\r\nhad the speakers clearly in view, even if many of them, owing to the\r\nsize of the gathering, were unable to hear the spoken word.\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion that Captain Craig, by the care with which every\r\nminute detail of the arrangements was thought out and provided for,\r\nfirst gave evidence of his remarkable gift for organisation that was to\r\nprove so invaluable to the Ulster cause in the next few years. The\r\ngreater part of the audience arrived in procession, which, starting\r\nfrom the centre of the city of Belfast, took over two hours to pass a\r\ngiven point, at the quick march in fours. All the Belfast Orange Lodges,\r\nand representative detachments from the County Grand Lodges, together\r\nwith Lord Templetown's Unionist Clubs, and other organisations,\r\nincluding the Women's Association, took part in the procession. But\r\nimmense numbers of people attended the meeting independently; it was\r\ncalculated that not less than a hundred thousand were present during the\r\ndelivery of Sir Edward Carson's speech, and although there must have\r\nbeen very many of them who could hear nothing, the complete silence\r\nmaintained by all was a remarkable proof--or so it appeared to men\r\nexperienced in out-door political demonstrations--of the earnestness of\r\nspirit that prevailed. To some it may appear still more remarkable that,\r\nwith such a concourse of people within a couple of miles of Belfast, not\r\na single policeman was present, and that none was required; no\r\ndisturbance of any sort occurred during the day, nor was a single case\r\nof drunkenness observed.\r\n\r\nIt had been intended that the Duke of Abercorn, whose inspiring\r\nexhortation as chairman of the Ulster Convention in 1892 had never been\r\nforgotten, should preside over the meeting; but, as he was prevented by\r\na family bereavement from being present, his place was taken by the Earl\r\nof Erne, Grand Master of the Orange Order. The scene, when he rose to\r\nopen the proceedings, was indescribable in its impressiveness. Some\r\nmembers of the Eighty Club happened to be in Ireland at the time, for\r\nthe purpose of \"seeing for themselves\" in the familiar fashion of such\r\npolitical tourists; but they did not think it worth while to witness\r\nwhat Ulster was doing at Craigavon. If they had, they could have made a\r\nreport to their political leaders which, had it been truthful, might\r\nhave averted some irreparable blunders; for they could hardly have\r\nlooked upon that sea of eager faces, or have observed the enthusiasm\r\nthat possessed such a host of earnest and resolute men, without revising\r\nthe opinion, which they had accepted from Mr. Redmond, that there was\r\n\"no Ulster question.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting took the form of according a welcome to Sir Edward Carson\r\nas the new leader of Irish Loyalism, and of Ulster in particular. But\r\nbefore he rose to speak a significant note had already been sounded.\r\nLord Erne struck it when he quoted words which were to become very\r\nfamiliar in Ulster--the letter from Gustavus Hamilton, Governor of\r\nEnniskillen in 1689, to \"divers of the nobility and gentry in the\r\nnorth-east part of Ulster,\" in which he declared: \"We stand upon our\r\nguard, and do resolve by the blessing of God to meet our danger rather\r\nthan to await it.\" And the veteran Liberal, Mr. Thomas Andrews, in\r\nmoving the resolution of welcome to the leader, expressed the universal\r\nsentiment of the multitude when he exclaimed, \"We will never, never bow\r\nthe knee to the disloyal factions led by Mr. John Redmond. We will never\r\nsubmit to be governed by rebels who acknowledge no law but the laws of\r\nthe Land League and illegal societies.\"\r\n\r\nA great number of Addresses from representative organisations were then\r\npresented to Sir Edward Carson, in many of which the determination to\r\nresist the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was plainly declared. But\r\nsuch declarations, although they undoubtedly expressed the mind of the\r\npeople, were after all in quite general terms. For a quarter of a\r\ncentury innumerable variations on the theme \"Ulster will fight, and\r\nUlster will be right,\" had been fiddled on Ulster platforms, so that\r\nthere was some excuse for the belief of those who were wholly ignorant\r\nof North Irish character that these utterances were no more than the\r\ncommonplaces of Ulster rhetoric. The time had only now come, however,\r\nwhen their reality could be put to the test. Carson's speech at\r\nCraigavon crystallised them into practical politics.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Carson's public speaking has always been entirely free from\r\nrhetorical artifice. He seldom made use of metaphor or imagery, or\r\nelaborate periods, or variety of gesture. His language was extremely\r\nsimple and straightforward; but his mobile expression--so variable that\r\nhis enemies saw in it a suggestion of Mephistopheles, and his friends a\r\nresemblance to Dante--his measured diction, and his skilful use of a\r\ndeep-toned voice, gave a remarkable impressiveness to all he said--even,\r\nindeed, to utterances which, if spoken by another, would sometimes have\r\nsounded commonplace or obvious. Sarcasm he could use with effect, and a\r\ntelling point was often made by an epigrammatic phrase which delighted\r\nhis hearers. And, more than all else, his meaning was never in doubt. In\r\nlucidity of statement he excelled many much greater orators, and was\r\nsurpassed by none; and these qualities, added to his unmistakable\r\nsincerity and candour, made him one of the most persuasive of speakers\r\non the platform, as he was also, of course, in the Law Courts.\r\n\r\nThe moment he began to speak at Craigavon the immense multitude who had\r\ncome to welcome him felt instinctively the grip of his power. The\r\ncontrast to all the previous scene--the cheering, the enthusiasm, the\r\nmarching, the singing, the waving of handkerchiefs and flags--was deeply\r\nimpressive, when, after a hushed pause of some length, he called\r\nattention without preface to the realities of the situation in a few\r\nsimple sentences of slow and almost solemn utterance:\r\n\r\n     \"I know full well what the Resolution you have just passed means; I\r\n     know what all these Addresses mean; I know the responsibility you\r\n     are putting upon me to-day. In your presence I cheerfully accept\r\n     it, grave as it is, and I now enter into a compact with you, and\r\n     every one of you, and with the help of God you and I joined\r\n     together--giving you the best I can, and you giving me all your\r\n     strength behind me--we will yet defeat the most nefarious\r\n     conspiracy that has ever been hatched against a free people. But I\r\n     know full well that this Resolution has a still wider meaning. It\r\n     shows me that you realise the gravity of the situation that is\r\n     before us, and it shows me that you are here to express your\r\n     determination to see this fight out to a finish.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on to expose the hollowness of the allegation, then current in\r\nLiberal circles, that Ulster's repugnance to Home Rule was less\r\nuncompromising than it formerly had been. On the contrary, he believed\r\nthat \"there never was a moment at which men were more resolved than at\r\nthe present, with all the force and strength that God has given them,\r\nto maintain the British connection and their rights as citizens of the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\" Apart from principle or sentiment, that was an\r\nattitude, he maintained, dictated by practical good sense. He showed how\r\nIreland had been \"advancing in prosperity in an unparalleled measure,\"\r\nfor which he could quote the authority of Mr. Redmond himself, although\r\nthe Nationalist leader had omitted to notice that this advance had taken\r\nplace under the legislative Union, and, as Carson contended, in\r\nconsequence of it. He laid special emphasis on the point, never\r\nforgotten, that the danger in which they stood was due to the\r\nhoodwinking of the British constituencies by Mr. Asquith's Ministry.\r\n\r\n     \"Make no mistake; we are going to fight with men who are prepared\r\n     to play with loaded dice. They are prepared to destroy their own\r\n     Constitution, so that they may pass Home Rule, and they are\r\n     prepared to destroy the very elements of constitutional government\r\n     by withdrawing the question from the electorate, who on two\r\n     previous occasions refused to be a party to it.\"\r\n\r\nHe ridiculed the \"paper safeguards\" which Liberal Ministers tried to\r\npersuade them would amply protect Ulster Protestants under a Dublin\r\nParliament, giving a vivid picture of the plight they would be in under\r\na Nationalist administration, which, he declared, meant \"a tyranny to\r\nwhich we never can and never will submit\"; and then, in a pregnant\r\npassage, he summarised the Ulster case:\r\n\r\n     \"Our demand is a very simple one. We ask for no privileges, but we\r\n     are determined that no one shall have privileges over us. We ask\r\n     for no special rights, but we claim the same rights from the same\r\n     Government as every other part of the United Kingdom. We ask for\r\n     nothing more; we will take nothing less. It is our inalienable\r\n     right as citizens of the British Empire, and Heaven help the men\r\n     who try to take it from us.\"\r\n\r\nIt was all no doubt a mere restatement--though an admirably lucid and\r\nforcible restatement--of doctrine with which his hearers had long been\r\nfamiliar. The great question still awaited an answer--how was effect to\r\nbe given to this resolve, now that there was no longer hope of\r\nsalvation through the sympathy and support of public opinion in Great\r\nBritain? This was what the eager listeners at Craigavon hoped in hushed\r\nexpectancy to hear from their new leader. He did not disappoint them:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Asquith, the Prime Minister, says that we are not to be\r\n     allowed to put our case before the British electorate. Very well.\r\n     By that determination he drives you in the ultimate result to rely\r\n     upon your own strength, and we must follow all that out to its\r\n     logical conclusion.... That involves something more than that we do\r\n     not accept Home Rule. We must be prepared, in the event of a Home\r\n     Rule Bill passing, with such measures as will carry on for\r\n     ourselves the government of those districts of which we have\r\n     control. We must be prepared--and time is precious in these\r\n     things--the morning Home Rule passes, ourselves to become\r\n     responsible for the government of the Protestant Province of\r\n     Ulster. We ask your leave at the meeting of the Ulster Unionist\r\n     Council, to be held on Monday, there to discuss the matter, and to\r\n     set to work, to take care that at no time and at no intervening\r\n     interval shall we lack a Government in Ulster, which shall be a\r\n     Government either by the Imperial Parliament, or by ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, was the first authoritative declaration of a definite policy\r\nto be pursued by Ulster in the circumstances then existing or foreseen,\r\nand it was a policy that was followed with undeviating consistency under\r\nCarson's leadership for the next nine years. To be left under the\r\ngovernment of the Imperial Parliament was the alternative to be\r\npreferred, and was asserted to be an inalienable right; but, if all\r\ntheir efforts to that end should be defeated, then \"a government by\r\nourselves\" was the only change that could be tolerated. Rather than\r\nsubmit to the jurisdiction of a Nationalist legislature and\r\nadministration, they would themselves set up a Government \"_in those\r\ndistricts of which they had control_.\" It was because, when the first of\r\nthese alternatives had to be sorrowfully abandoned, the second was\r\noffered in the Government of Ireland Act of 1920 that Ulster did not\r\nactively oppose the passing of that statute.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] _Annual Register_, 1911, p. 175.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CRAIGAVON POLICY AND THE U.F.V.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in giving practical shape to the policy outlined at\r\nCraigavon, and in taking steps to give effect to it. On the 25th of\r\nSeptember a meeting of four hundred delegates representing the Ulster\r\nUnionist Council, the County Grand Orange Lodges, and the Unionist\r\nClubs, was held in Belfast, and, after lengthy discussion in private,\r\nwhen the only differences of opinion were as to the most effective\r\nmethods of proceeding, two resolutions were unanimously adopted and\r\npublished. It is noteworthy that, at this early stage in the movement,\r\nout of nearly four hundred popularly elected delegates, numbers of whom\r\nwere men holding responsible positions or engaged in commercial\r\nbusiness, not one raised an objection to the policy itself, although its\r\ngrave possibilities were thoroughly appreciated by all present. Both\r\nLord Londonderry, who presided, and Sir Edward Carson left no room for\r\ndoubt in that respect; the developments they might be called upon to\r\nface were thoroughly searched and explained, and the fullest opportunity\r\nto draw back was offered to any present who might shrink from going on.\r\n\r\nThe first Resolution registered a \"call upon our leaders to take any\r\nsteps they may consider necessary to resist the establishment of Home\r\nRule in Ireland, solemnly pledging ourselves that under no conditions\r\nshall we acknowledge any such Government\"; and it gave an assurance that\r\nthose whom the delegates represented would give the leaders \"their\r\nunwavering support in any danger they may be called upon to face.\" The\r\nsecond decided that \"the time has now come when we consider it our\r\nimperative duty to make arrangements for the provisional government of\r\nUlster,\" and for that purpose it went on to appoint a Commission of\r\nfive leading local men, namely, Captain James Craig, M.P., Colonel\r\nSharman Crawford, M.P., the Right Hon. Thomas Sinclair, Colonel R.H.\r\nWallace, C.B., and Mr. Edward Sclater, Secretary of the Unionist Clubs,\r\nwhose duties were _(a)_ \"to keep Sir Edward Carson in constant and close\r\ntouch with the feeling of Unionist Ulster,\" and _(b)_ \"to take immediate\r\nsteps, in consultation with Sir Edward Carson, to frame and submit a\r\nConstitution for a Provisional Government of Ulster, having due regard\r\nto the interests of the Loyalists in other parts of Ireland: the powers\r\nand duration of such Provisional Government to come into operation on\r\nthe day of the passage of any Home Rule Bill, to remain in force until\r\nUlster shall again resume unimpaired her citizenship in the United\r\nKingdom.\"\r\n\r\nAt the luncheon given by Lord Londonderry after this business\r\nconference, Carson took occasion to refer to a particularly contemptible\r\nslander to which currency had been given some days previously by Sir\r\nJohn Benn, one of the Eighty Club strolling seekers after truth. It was\r\nperhaps hardly worth while to notice a statement so silly as that the\r\nUlster leader had been ready a few weeks previously to betray Ulster in\r\norder to save the House of Lords, but Carson did not yet realise the\r\ndegree to which he had already won the confidence of his followers;\r\nmoreover, the incident proved useful as an opportunity of emphasising\r\nthe uninterrupted mutual confidence between Lord Londonderry and\r\nhimself, in spite of their divergence of opinion over the Parliament\r\nBill. It also gave those present a glimpse of their leader's power of\r\nshrivelling meanness with a few caustic drops of scorn.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings at Craigavon and at the Conference naturally created a\r\nsensation on both sides of the Channel. They brought the question of\r\nIreland once more, for the first time since 1895, into the forefront of\r\nBritish politics. The House of Commons might spend the autumn ploughing\r\nits way through the intricacies of the National Insurance Bill, but\r\neveryone knew that the last and bitterest battle against Home Rule was\r\nnow approaching. And, now that the Parliament Act was safely on the\r\nStatute-book, Ministers had no further interest in concealment. During\r\nthe elections, from which alone they could procure authority for\r\nlegislation of so fundamental a character, Mr. Asquith, as we have seen,\r\nregarded any inquiry as to his intentions as \"confusing the issue.\" But\r\nnow that he had the constituencies in his pocket for five years and\r\nnothing further was to be feared from that quarter, his cards were\r\nplaced on the table.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of October Mr. Winston Churchill told his followers at Dundee\r\nthat the Government would introduce a Home Rule Bill next session \"and\r\npress it forward with all their strength,\" and he added the\r\ncharacteristic injunction that \"they must not take Sir Edward Carson too\r\nseriously.\" But that advice did not prevent Mr. Herbert Samuel, another\r\nmember of the Cabinet, from putting in an appearance in Belfast four\r\ndays later, where he threw himself into a ludicrously unequal combat\r\nwith Carson, exerting himself to calm the fears of business men as to\r\nthe effect of Home Rule on their prosperity; while, in the same week,\r\nCarson himself, at a great Unionist demonstration in Dublin, described\r\nthe growth of Irish prosperity in the last twenty years as \"almost a\r\nfairy tale,\" which would be cut short by Home Rule. On the 19th of the\r\nsame month Mr. Birrell, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, in a speech at\r\nIlfracombe, gave some scraps of meagre information in regard to the\r\nprovisions that would be included in the coming Home Rule Bill; and on\r\nthe 21st Mr. Redmond announced that the drafting of the Bill was almost\r\ncompleted, and that the measure would be \"satisfactory to Nationalists\r\nboth in principle and detail.\"[13]\r\n\r\nSo the autumn of 1911 wore through--Ministers doling out snippets of\r\ninformation; members of Parliament and the Press urging them to give\r\nmore. The people of Ulster, on the other hand, were not worrying over\r\ndetails. They did not require to be told that the principle would be\r\n\"satisfactory to Nationalists,\" for they knew that the Government had to\r\n\"toe the line\"; nor were they in doubt that what was satisfactory to\r\nNationalists must be unsatisfactory to themselves. What they were\r\nthinking about was not what the Bill would or would not contain, but the\r\npreparations they were making to resist its operation.\r\n\r\nA day or two after Craigavon the leader spoke at a great meeting in\r\nPortrush, after receiving, at every important station he passed _en\r\nroute_ from Belfast, enthusiastic addresses expressing confidence in\r\nhimself and approval of the Craigavon declaration; and in this speech he\r\nconsiderably amplified what he had said at Craigavon. After explaining\r\nhow the whole outlook had been changed by the Parliament Act, which cut\r\nthem off from appeal to the sympathies of Englishmen, he pointed out to\r\nhis hearers the only course now open to them, namely, that resolved upon\r\nat Craigavon.\r\n\r\n     \"Some people,\" he continued, \"say that I am preaching disorder. No,\r\n     in the course I am advising I am preaching order, because I believe\r\n     that, unless we are in a position ourselves to take over the\r\n     government of those places we are able to control, the people of\r\n     Ulster, if let loose without that organisation, and without that\r\n     organised determination, might in a foolish moment find themselves\r\n     in a condition of antagonism and grips with their foes which I\r\n     believe even the present Government would lament. And therefore I\r\n     say that the course we recommend--and it has been solemnly adopted\r\n     by your four hundred representatives, after mature discussion in\r\n     which every man understood what it was he was voting about--is the\r\n     only course that I know of that is possible under the circumstances\r\n     of this Province which is consistent with the maintenance of law\r\n     and order and the prevention of bloodshed.\"\r\n\r\nSuperficially, these words may appear boldly paradoxical; but in fact\r\nthey were prophetic, for the closest observers of the events of the next\r\nthree years, familiar with Irish character and conditions, were in no\r\ndoubt whatever that it was the disciplined organisation of the Ulster\r\nUnionists alone that prevented the outbreak of serious disorders in the\r\nNorth. There was, on the contrary, a diminution even of ordinary crime,\r\naccompanied by a marked improvement in the general demeanour, and\r\nespecially in the sobriety, of the people.\r\n\r\nThe speaker then touched upon a question which naturally arose out of\r\nthe Craigavon policy of resistance to Home Rule. He had been asked, he\r\nsaid, whether Ulster proposed to fight against the forces of the Crown.\r\nHe had already contrasted their own methods with those of the\r\nNationalists, saying that Ulstermen would never descend to action \"from\r\nbehind hedges or by maiming cattle, or by boycotting of individuals\"; he\r\nnow added that they were \"not going to fight the Army and the Navy ...\r\nGod forbid that any loyal Irishman should ever shoot or think of\r\nshooting the British soldier or sailor. But, believe me, any Government\r\nwill ponder long before it dares to shoot a loyal Ulster Protestant,\r\ndevoted to his country and loyal to his King.\"\r\n\r\nIn newspaper reports of public meetings, sayings of pith and moment are\r\noften attributed to \"A Voice\" from the audience. On this occasion, when\r\nSir Edward Carson referred to the Army and the Navy, \"A Voice\" cried\r\n\"They are on our side.\" It was the truth, as subsequent events were to\r\nshow. It would indeed have been strange had it been otherwise. Men\r\nwearing His Majesty's uniform, who had been quartered at one time in\r\nBelfast or Carrickfergus and at another in Cork or Limerick, could be\r\nunder no illusion as to where that uniform was held in respect and where\r\nit was scorned. The certainty that the reality of their own loyalty was\r\nunderstood by the men who served the King was a sustaining thought to\r\nUlstermen through these years of trial.\r\n\r\nThis Portrush speech cleared the air. It made known the _modus\r\noperandi_, as Craigavon had made known the policy. Henceforward Ulster\r\nUnionists had a definite idea of what was before them, and they had\r\nalready unbounded confidence both in the sagacity and in the courage of\r\nthe man who had become their leader.\r\n\r\nThe Craigavon meeting led, almost by accident as it were, to a\r\ndevelopment the importance of which was hardly foreseen at the time.\r\nAmong the processionists who passed through Captain Craig's grounds\r\nthere was a contingent of Orangemen from County Tyrone who attracted\r\ngeneral attention by their smart appearance and the orderly precision of\r\ntheir marching. On inquiry it was learnt that these men had of their own\r\naccord been learning military drill. The spirit of emulation naturally\r\nsuggested to others to follow the example of the Tyrone Lodges. It was\r\nsoon followed, not by Orangemen alone, but by members of the Unionist\r\nClubs, very many of whom belonged to no Orange Lodge. Within a few\r\nmonths drilling--of an elementary kind, it is true--had become popular\r\nin many parts of the country. Colonel R.H. Wallace, C.B., who had served\r\nwith distinction in the South African War, where he commanded the 5th\r\nRoyal Irish Rifles, was a prominent member of the Orange Institution, in\r\nwhich he was in 1911 Grand Master of the Belfast Lodges, and Grand\r\nSecretary of the Provincial Grand Orange Lodge of Ulster; and, being a\r\nman of marked ability and widespread popularity, his influence was\r\npowerful and extensive. He was a devoted adherent of Carson, and there\r\nwas no keener spirit among the Ulster Loyalist leaders. Colonel Wallace\r\nwas among the first to perceive the importance of this military drilling\r\nthat was taking place throughout Ulster, and through his leading\r\nposition in the Orange Institution his encouragement did much to extend\r\nthe practice.\r\n\r\nHaving been a lawyer by profession before South Africa called him to\r\nserve his country in arms, Wallace was careful to ascertain how the law\r\nstood with regard to the drilling that was going on. He consulted Mr.\r\nJames Campbell (afterwards Lord Chancellor of Ireland), who advised that\r\nany two Justices of the Peace had power to authorise drill and other\r\nmilitary exercises within the area of their jurisdiction on certain\r\nconditions. The terms of the application made by Colonel Wallace himself\r\nto two Belfast magistrates show what the conditions were, and, under the\r\ncircumstances of the time, are not without a flavour of humour. The\r\nrequest stated that Wallace and another officer of the Belfast Grand\r\nLodge were--\r\n\r\n\"Authorised on behalf of the members thereof to apply for lawful\r\nauthority to them to hold meetings of the members of the said Lodge and\r\nthe Lodges under its jurisdiction for the purpose of training and\r\ndrilling themselves and of being trained and drilled to the use of arms,\r\nand for the purpose of practising military exercises, movements, and\r\nevolutions. And we are authorised, on their behalf, to give their\r\nassurance that they desire this authority as faithful subjects of His\r\nMajesty the King, and their undertaking that such authority is sought\r\nand will be used by them only to make them more efficient citizens for\r\nthe purpose of maintaining the constitution of the United Kingdom as now\r\nestablished and protecting their rights and liberties thereunder.\"\r\n\r\nThe _bona fides_ of an application couched in these terms, which\r\nfollowed well-established precedent, could not be questioned by any\r\nloyal subject of His Majesty. The purpose for which the licence was\r\nrequested was stated with literal exactness and without subterfuge.\r\nThere was nothing seditious or revolutionary in it, and the desire of\r\nmen to make themselves more efficient citizens for maintaining the\r\nestablished government of their country, and their rights and liberties\r\nunder it, was surely not merely innocent of offence, but praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nSuch, at all events, was the view taken by numbers of strictly\r\nconscientious holders of the Commission of the Peace throughout Ulster,\r\nwith the result that the Ulster Volunteer Force sprang into existence\r\nwithin a few months without the smallest violation of the law.\r\nOriginating in the Orange Lodges and the Unionist Clubs, it soon\r\nenrolled large numbers of men outside both those organisations. Men with\r\nmilitary experience interested themselves in training the volunteers in\r\ntheir districts; the local bodies were before long drawn into a single\r\ncoherent organisation on a territorial basis, which soon gave rise to an\r\n_esprit de corps_ leading to friendly rivalry in efficiency between the\r\nlocal battalions.\r\n\r\nThis Ulster Volunteer Force had as yet no arms in their hands, but, as\r\nthe first act of the Liberal Government on coming into power in 1906 had\r\nbeen to drop the \"coercion\" Act which prohibited the importation of\r\nfirearms into Ireland, there was no reason why, in the course of time,\r\nthe U.V.F. should not be fully armed with as complete an avoidance of\r\nillegality as that with which in the meantime they were acquiring some\r\nknowledge of military duties. But for the present they had to be content\r\nwith wooden \"dummy\" rifles with which to learn their drill, an expedient\r\nwhich, as will be seen later on, excited the derisive mirth of the\r\nEnglish Radical Press.\r\n\r\nThe application to the Belfast Justices for leave to drill the Orange\r\nLodges was dated the 5th of January, 1912. For some months both before\r\nand after that date the formation of new battalions proceeded rapidly,\r\nso that by the summer of 1912 the force was of considerable strength and\r\ndecent efficiency; but already in the autumn of 1911 it soon became\r\napparent that the existence of such a force would give a backing to the\r\nCraigavon policy which nothing else could provide. At Craigavon the\r\nleader of the movement had foreshadowed the possibility of having to\r\ntake charge of the government of those districts which the Loyalists\r\ncould control. The U.V.F. made such control a practical proposition, and\r\nthe consciousness of this throughout Ulster gave a solid reality to the\r\nmovement which it must otherwise have lacked.\r\n\r\nThe special Commission of Five set to work immediately after the\r\nCraigavon meeting to carry out the task entrusted to them by the\r\nCouncil. But, as more than two years must elapse before the Home Rule\r\nBill could become law under the Parliament Act, there was no immediate\r\nurgency in making arrangements for setting up the Provisional Government\r\nresolved upon by the Council on the 25th of September, 1911, and the\r\noutside public heard nothing about what was being done in the matter for\r\nmany months to come.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Ulster Loyalists watched with something akin to dismay the\r\ndissensions in the Unionist party in England over the question of Tariff\r\nReform, which made impossible a united front against the revived attack\r\non the Union, and woefully weakened the effective force of the\r\nOpposition both in Parliament and the country. Public opinion was\r\ndiverted from the one thing that really mattered--had Englishmen been\r\nable to realise it--from an Imperial standpoint, no less than from the\r\nstandpoint of Irish Loyalists. On the 8th of November, 1911, mainly in\r\nconsequence of these dissensions, Mr. Balfour resigned the leadership of\r\nthe Unionist Party. This event was regarded in Ulster as a calamity. Mr.\r\nBalfour was the ablest and most zealous living defender of the Union,\r\nand the great services he had rendered to the country during his\r\nmemorable Chief Secretaryship were not forgotten. Ulstermen, in whose\r\neyes the tariff question was of very subordinate importance, feared that\r\nno one could be found to take command of the Unionist forces comparable\r\nwith the Achilles who, as they supposed, was now retiring to his tent.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in regard to the vacant leadership is well known--how Mr.\r\nWalter Long and Mr. Austen Chamberlain, after presenting themselves for\r\na day or two as rival candidates, patriotically agreed to stand aside\r\nand give united support to Mr. Bonar Law in order to avoid a division in\r\nthe ranks of the party. It is less generally known that Mr. Bonar Law,\r\nbefore consenting to his name being proposed, wrote and asked Sir Edward\r\nCarson if he would accept the leadership, and that it was only when he\r\nreceived an emphatic reply in the negative that he assumed the\r\nresponsibility himself. If this had been known at the time in Ulster\r\nthere can be little doubt that consternation would have been caused by\r\nthe refusal of their own leader to place himself at the head of the\r\nwhole Unionist Party. It is quite certain that Sir Edward Carson would\r\nhave been acceptable to the party meeting at the Carlton Club, for he\r\nwas then much better known to the party both in the House of Commons and\r\nin the country than was Mr. Bonar Law, whose great qualities as\r\nparliamentarian and statesman had not yet been revealed; but it is not\r\nless certain that, if his first thought was to be of service to Ulster,\r\nCarson acted wisely in maintaining a position of independence, in which\r\nall his powers could continue to be concentrated on a single aim of\r\nstatecraft.\r\n\r\nAt all events, the new leader of the Unionist Party was not long in\r\nproving that the Ulster cause had suffered no set-back by the change,\r\nand his constant and courageous backing of the Ulster leader won him\r\nthe unstinted admiration and affection of every Irish Loyalist. Mr.\r\nBalfour also soon showed that he was no sulking Achilles; his loyalty to\r\nthe Unionist cause was undimmed; he never for a moment acted, as a\r\nmeaner man might, as if his successor were a supplanter; and within the\r\nnext few months he many times rose from beside Mr. Bonar Law in the\r\nHouse of Commons to deliver some of the best speeches he ever made on\r\nthe question of Irish Government, full of cogent and crushing criticism\r\nof the Home Rule proposals of Mr. Asquith.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] _Annual Register_, 1911, p. 228.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMR. CHURCHILL IN BELFAST\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the women's meeting at the Ulster Hall on the 18th of January,\r\n1912,[14] Lord Londonderry took occasion to recall once more to the\r\nmemory of his audience the celebrated speech delivered by Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill in the same building twenty-six years before. That clarion\r\nwas, indeed, in no danger of being forgotten; but there happened at that\r\nparticular moment to be a very special reason for Ulstermen to remember\r\nit, and the incident which was present in Londonderry's mind--a\r\nResolution passed by the Standing Committee of the Ulster Unionist\r\nCouncil two days earlier--proved to be so distinct a turning-point in\r\nthe history of Ulster's stand for the Union that it claims more than a\r\npassing mention.\r\n\r\n\"Diligence and vigilance should be your watchword, so that the blow, if\r\nit is coming, may not come upon you as a thief in the night, and may not\r\nfind you unready and taken by surprise.\" Such had been Lord Randolph's\r\nwarning. It was now learnt, with feelings in which disgust and\r\nindignation were equally mingled, that Lord Randolph's son was bent on\r\ncoming to Belfast, not indeed as a thief in the night, but with\r\nchallenging audacity, to give his countenance, encouragement, and\r\nsupport to the adherents of disloyalty whom Lord Randolph had told\r\nUlster to resist to the death. And not only was he coming to Belfast; he\r\nwas coming to the Ulster Hall--to the very building which his father's\r\noration had, as it were, consecrated to the Unionist cause, and which\r\nhad come to be regarded as almost a loyalist shrine.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt difficult for those who are unfamiliar with the\r\npsychology of the North of Ireland to understand the anger which this\r\nprojected visit of Mr. Winston Churchill aroused in Belfast. His change\r\nof political allegiance from the party which his father had so\r\nbrilliantly served and led, to the party which his father had so\r\npitilessly chastised, was of course displeasing to Conservatives\r\neverywhere. Politicians who leave their friends to join their opponents\r\nare never popular with those they abandon, and Mr. Winston Churchill was\r\ncertainly no exception. But such desertions, after the first burst of\r\nwrath has evaporated, are generally accepted with a philosophic shrug in\r\nwhat journalists call \"political circles\" in London, where plenty of\r\nprecedents for lapses from party virtue can be quoted. In the provinces,\r\neven in England, resentment dies down less easily, and forgiveness is of\r\nslow growth; but in Ulster, where a political creed is held with a\r\nreligious fervour, or, as a hostile critic might put it, with an\r\nintolerance unknown in England, and where the dividing line between\r\n\"loyalty\" and \"disloyalty\" is regarded almost as a matter of faith, the\r\nman who passes from the one to the other arouses the same bitterness of\r\nanger and contempt which soldiers feel for a deserter in face of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nTo such sentiments there was added, in the case of Mr. Winston\r\nChurchill, a shocked feeling that his appearance in the Ulster Hall as\r\nan emissary of Home Rule would be an act not only of political apostasy\r\nbut of filial impiety. The prevailing sentiment in Belfast at the time\r\nwas expressed somewhat brutally, perhaps, in the local Press--\"he is\r\ncoming to dance on his father's coffin.\" It was an outrage on their\r\nfeelings which the people of Belfast could not and would not tolerate.\r\nIf Mr. Churchill was determined to flaunt the green flag let him find a\r\nmore suitable site than the very citadel in which they had been exhorted\r\nby his father to keep the Union Jack flying to the last.\r\n\r\nIf anything could have added to the anger excited by this announcement\r\nit would have been the fact that the Cabinet Minister was to be\r\naccompanied on the platform of the Ulster Hall by Mr. Redmond and Mr.\r\nDevlin, and that Lord Pirrie was to be his chairman. There was no more\r\nunpopular citizen of Belfast than Lord Pirrie; and the reason was neatly\r\nexplained to English readers by the Special Correspondent of _The\r\nTimes_. \"Lord Pirrie,\" he wrote, \"deserted Unionism about the time the\r\nLiberals acceded to power, and soon afterwards was made a Peer; whether\r\n_propter hoc_ or only _post hoc_ I am quite unable to say, though no\r\nUlster Unionist has any doubts on the subject.\"[15] But that was not\r\nquite the whole reason. That Lord Pirrie was an example of apostasy\r\n\"just for a riband to stick in his coat,\" was the general belief; but it\r\nwas also resented that a man who had amassed, not \"a handful of silver,\"\r\nbut an enormous fortune, through a trade created by an eminent Unionist\r\nfirm, and under conditions brought about in Belfast by the Union with\r\nGreat Britain, should have kicked away the ladder by which he had\r\nclimbed from obscurity to wealth and rank. An additional cause of\r\noffence, moreover, was that he was at that time trying to persuade\r\ncredulous people in England that there was in Ulster a party of Liberals\r\nand Protestant Home Rulers, of which he posed as leader, although\r\neveryone on the spot knew that the \"party\" would not fill a tramcar. Of\r\nthis party the same Correspondent of _The Times_ very truly said:\r\n\r\n     \"Nearly every prominent man in it has received an office or a\r\n     decoration--and the fact that, with all the power of patronage in\r\n     their hands for the last six years, the Government had been able to\r\n     make so small an inroad into the solid square of Ulster Unionism is\r\n     a remarkable testimony to the strength of the sentiment which gives\r\n     it cohesion.\"\r\n\r\nBut a score of individuals in possession of an office equipped with\r\nstamped stationery, and with a titled chairman of fabulous wealth, have\r\nno difficulty in deluding strangers at a distance into the belief that\r\nthey are an influential and representative body of men. It was in\r\nfurtherance of the scheme for creating this false impression across the\r\nChannel that Lord Pirrie and his so-called \"Ulster Liberal Association\"\r\ninvited Mr. Winston Churchill and the two Nationalist leaders to speak\r\nin the Ulster Hall on the 8th of February, 1912, and that the\r\nannouncement of the fixture was made in the Press some three weeks\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nThe Unionist leaders were not long left in ignorance of the public\r\nexcitement which this news created in the city. A specially summoned\r\nmeeting of the Standing Committee, with Londonderry in the chair, was\r\nheld on the 16th of January to consider what action, if any, should be\r\ntaken; but it was no simple matter they had to decide, especially in the\r\nabsence of their leader, Sir Edward Carson, who was kept in England by\r\ngreat Unionist meetings which he was addressing in Lancashire.\r\n\r\nThe reasons, on the one hand, for doing nothing were obvious enough. No\r\none, of course, suggested the possibility of preventing Mr. Churchill\r\ncoming to Belfast; but could even the Ulster Hall itself, the Loyalist\r\nsanctuary, be preserved from the threatened desecration? It was the\r\nproperty of the Corporation, and the Unionist political organisation had\r\nno exclusive title to its use. The meeting could only be frustrated by\r\nforce in some form, or by a combination of force and stratagem. The\r\nStanding Committee, all men of solid sense and judgment, several of whom\r\nwere Privy Councillors, were very fully alive to the objections to any\r\nresort to force in such a matter. They valued freedom of speech as\r\nhighly as any Englishman, and they realised the odium that interference\r\nwith it might bring both on themselves and their cause; and the last\r\nthing they desired at the present crisis was to alienate public sympathy\r\nin Great Britain. The force of such considerations was felt strongly by\r\nseveral members, indeed by all, of the Committee, and not least by Lord\r\nLondonderry himself, whose counsel naturally carried great weight.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, the danger of a passive attitude was also fully\r\nrecognised. It was perfectly well understood that one of the chief\r\ndesires of the Liberal Government and its followers at this time was to\r\nmake the world believe that Ulster's opposition to Home Rule had\r\ndeclined in strength in recent years; that there really was a\r\nconsiderable body of Protestant opinion in agreement with Lord Pirrie,\r\nand prepared to support Home Rule on \"Liberal,\" if not on avowedly\r\n\"Nationalist\" principles, and that the policy for which Carson,\r\nLondonderry, and the Unionist Council stood was a gigantic piece of\r\nbluff which only required to be exposed to disappear in general\r\nderision.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view the Churchill meeting could only be regarded as\r\na deliberate challenge and provocation to Ulster. It seemed probable\r\nthat the First Lord of the Admiralty had been selected for the mission\r\nin preference to any other Minister precisely because he was Lord\r\nRandolph's son. All this bluster about \"fight and be right\" was\r\ntraceable, so Liberal Ministers doubtless reasoned, to that unhappy\r\nspeech of \"Winston's father\"; let Winston go over to the same place and\r\nexplain his father away. If he obtained a hearing in the Ulster Hall in\r\nthe company of Redmond, Devlin, and Pirrie the legend of Ulster as an\r\nimpregnable loyalist stronghold would be wiped out, and Randolph's rant\r\ncould be made to appear a foolish joke in comparison with the more\r\nmature and discriminating wisdom of Winston.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, of course, be definitely asserted that the situation was thus\r\nweighed deliberately by the Cabinet, or by Mr. Churchill himself. But,\r\nif it was not, they must have been deficient in foresight; for there can\r\nbe no doubt, as several writers in the Press perceived, that the\r\ntransaction would so have presented itself to the mind of the public;\r\nthe psychological result would inure to the benefit of the Home Rulers.\r\n\r\nBut there was also another consideration which could not be ignored by\r\nthe Standing Committee--namely, the attitude of that important\r\nindividual, the \"man in the street.\" Among the innumerable\r\nmisrepresentations levelled at the Ulster Movement none was more common\r\nthan that it was confined to a handful of lords, landlords, and wealthy\r\nemployers of labour; and, as a corollary, that all the trouble was\r\ncaused by the perversity of a few individuals, of whom the most guilty\r\nwas Sir Edward Carson. The truth was very different. Even at the zenith\r\nof his influence and popularity Sir Edward himself would have been\r\ninstantly disowned by the Ulster democracy if he had given away anything\r\nfundamental to the Unionist cause. More than to anything else he owed\r\nhis power to his pledge, never violated, that he would never commit his\r\nfollowers to any irretraceable step without the consent of the Council,\r\nin which they were fully represented on a democratic basis. At the\r\nparticular crisis now reached popular feeling could not be safely\r\ndisregarded, and it was clearly understood by the Standing Committee\r\nthat public excitement over the coming visit of Mr. Churchill was only\r\nbeing kept within bounds by the belief of the public that their leaders\r\nwould not \"let them down.\"\r\n\r\nAll these considerations were most carefully balanced at the meeting on\r\nthe 16th of January, and there were prolonged deliberations before the\r\ndecision was arrived at that some action must be taken to prevent the\r\nChurchill meeting being held in the Ulster Hall, but that no obstacle\r\ncould, of course, be made to his speaking in any other building in\r\nBelfast. The further question as to what this action should be was under\r\ndiscussion when Colonel R.H. Wallace, C.B., Grand Master of the Belfast\r\nOrangemen, and a man of great influence with all classes in the city as\r\nwell as in the neighbouring counties, entered the room and told the\r\nCommittee that people outside were expecting the Unionist Council to\r\ndevise means for stopping the Ulster Hall meeting; that they were quite\r\nresolved to take matters into their own hands if the Council remained\r\npassive; and that, in his judgment, the result in that event would\r\nprobably be very serious disorder and bloodshed, and the loss of all\r\ncontrol over the Unionist rank and file by their leaders.\r\n\r\nThis information arrived too late to influence the decision on the main\r\nquestion, but it confirmed its wisdom and set at rest the doubts which\r\nsome of the Committee had at first entertained. It was reported at the\r\ntime that there had been a dissenting minority consisting of Lord\r\nLondonderry, Mr. Sinclair, and Mr. John Young, the last-mentioned being\r\na Privy Councillor, a trusted leader of the Presbyterians, and a man of\r\nmoderate views whose great influence throughout the north-eastern\r\ncounties was due to his high character and the soundness of his\r\njudgment. There was, however, no truth in this report, which\r\nLondonderry publicly contradicted; but it is probable that the\r\nconcurrence of the men mentioned, and perhaps of others, was owing to\r\ntheir well-founded conviction that the course decided upon, however\r\nhigh-handed it might appear to onlookers at a distance, was in reality\r\nthe only means of averting much more deplorable consequences.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, January 17th, an immense sensation was created by\r\nthe publication of the Resolution which had been unanimously adopted on\r\nthe motion of Captain James Craig, M.P. It was:\r\n\r\n     \"That the Standing Committee of the Ulster Unionist Council\r\n     observes with astonishment the deliberate challenge thrown down by\r\n     Mr. Winston Churchill, Mr. John Redmond, Mr. Joseph Devlin, and\r\n     Lord Pirrie in announcing their intention to hold a Home Rule\r\n     meeting in the centre of the loyal city of Belfast, and resolves to\r\n     take steps to prevent its being held.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an immediate outpouring of vituperation by the Ministerial\r\nPress in England, as had been anticipated by the Standing Committee.\r\nSpecial Correspondents trooped over to Belfast, whence they filled their\r\npapers with telegrams, articles, and interviews, ringing the changes on\r\nthe audacity of this unwarranted interference with freedom of speech,\r\nand speculating as to the manner in which the threat, was likely to be\r\ncarried out. Scribes of \"Open Letters\" had a fine opportunity to display\r\ntheir gift of insolent invective. Cartoonists and caricaturists had a\r\ntime of rare enjoyment, and let their pencils run riot. Writers in the\r\nLiberal Press for the most part assumed that Mr. Churchill would bid\r\ndefiance to the Ulster Unionist Council; others urged him to do so and\r\nto fulfil his engagement; some, with more prudence, suggested that he\r\nmight be extricated from the difficulty without loss of dignity if the\r\nChief Secretary would prohibit the meeting, as likely to produce a\r\nbreach of peace, and it was pointed out that Dublin Castle would\r\ncertainly forbid a meeting in Tipperary organised by the Ulster Unionist\r\nCouncil, with Sir Edward Carson as principal speaker.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the 25th of January Mr. Churchill addressed a letter, dated\r\nfrom the Admiralty, to Lord Londonderry at Mount Stewart, in which he\r\nsaid he was prepared to give up the idea of speaking in the Ulster Hall,\r\nand would arrange for his meeting to be held elsewhere in the city, as\r\n\"it was not a point of any importance to him where he spoke in Belfast.\"\r\nHe did not explain why, if that were the case, he had ever made a plan\r\nthat so obviously constituted a direct premeditated challenge to Ulster.\r\nLord Londonderry, in his reply, said that the Ulster Unionist Council\r\nhad no intention of interfering with any meeting Mr. Churchill might\r\narrange \"outside the districts which passionately resent your action,\"\r\nbut that, \"having regard to the intense state of feeling\" which had been\r\naroused, the Council could accept no responsibility for anything that\r\nmight occur during the visit. Mr. Churchill's prudent change of plan\r\nrelieved the extreme tension of the situation, and there was much\r\nspeculation as to what influence had produced a result so satisfactory\r\nto the Ulster Unionist Council. The truth seems to be that the Council's\r\nResolution had impaled the Government on the horns of a very awkward\r\ndilemma, completely turning the tables on Ministers, whose design had\r\nbeen to compel the Belfast Unionists either to adopt, on the one hand,\r\nan attitude of apparent intolerance which would put them in the wrong in\r\nthe eyes of the British public, or, on the other, to submit to the\r\nflagrant misrepresentation of their whole position which would be the\r\noutcome of a Nationalist meeting in the Ulster Hall presided over by the\r\nPresident of the illusory \"Ulster Liberal Association,\" and with Lord\r\nRandolph Churchill's son as the protagonist of Home Rule. The threat to\r\nstop the meeting forced the Government to consider how the First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty and his friends were to be protected and enabled to fulfil\r\ntheir programme. The Irish Executive, according to the Dublin\r\nCorrespondent of _The Times_, objected to the employment of troops for\r\nthis purpose; because--\r\n\r\n     \"If the Belfast Unionists decided to resist the soldiers, bloodshed\r\n     and disorder on a large scale must have ensued. If, on the other\r\n     hand, they yielded to the _force majeure_ of British bayonets, and\r\n     Mr. Churchill was enabled to speak in the Ulster Hall, they would\r\n     still have carried their point; they would have proved to the\r\n     English people that Home Rule could only be thrust upon Ulster by\r\n     an overwhelming employment of military force. The Executive\r\n     preferred to depend on the services of a large police force. And\r\n     this meant that Mr. Churchill could not speak in the Ulster Hall;\r\n     for the Belfast democracy, though it might yield to soldiers, would\r\n     certainly offer a fierce resistance to the police. It seemed,\r\n     therefore, that the Government's only safe and prudent course was\r\n     to prevent Mr. Churchill from trying to speak in that Hall.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThe Government, in fact, had been completely out-manoeuvred. They had\r\ngiven the Ulster Unionist Council an opportunity to show its own\r\nconstituents and the outside world that, where the occasion demanded\r\naction, it could act with decision; and they had failed utterly to drive\r\na wedge between Ulster and the Unionist Party in England and in the\r\nSouth of Ireland, as they hoped to do by goading Belfast into\r\nillegality. On the other hand, they had aroused some misgiving in the\r\nranks of their own supporters. A political observer in London reported\r\nthat the incident had--\r\n\r\n     \"Caused a feeling of considerable apprehension in Radical circles.\r\n     The pretence that Ulster does not mean to fight is now almost\r\n     abandoned even by the most fanatical Home Rulers.\"[17]\r\n\r\nUnionist journals in Great Britain, almost without exception, applauded\r\nthe conduct of the Council, and proved by their comments that they\r\nunderstood its motive, and sympathised with the feelings of Ulster. _The\r\nSaturday Review_ expressed the general view when it wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"With the indignation of the loyal Ulstermen at this proposal we\r\n     are in complete sympathy. Where there is a question of Home Rule,\r\n     the Ulster Hall is sacred ground, and to the Ulster mind and,\r\n     indeed, to the mind of any calm outsider, there is something both\r\n     impudent and impious in the proposal that this temple of Unionism\r\n     should be profaned by the son of a man who assisted at its\r\n     consecration.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe southern Unionists of Ireland thoroughly appreciated the difficulty\r\nthat had confronted their friends in the North, and approved the way it\r\nhad been met. This was natural enough, since, as the Dublin\r\nCorrespondent of _The Times_ pointed out--\r\n\r\n     \"They understand Ulster's position better than it can be understood\r\n     in England. They realise that the provocation has been extreme.\r\n     There has been a deliberate conspiracy to persuade the English\r\n     people, first, that Ulster is weakening in its opposition to Home\r\n     Rule; and, next, that its declared refusal to accept Home Rule in\r\n     any form is mere bluff. It became necessary for Ulster to defeat\r\n     this conspiracy, and the Ulster Council's Resolution has defeated\r\n     it.\"[19]\r\n\r\nA few days later a still more valuable token of sympathy and support\r\nfrom across the Channel gave fresh encouragement to Ulster. On the 26th\r\nof January Mr. Bonar Law made his first public speech as leader of the\r\nUnionist Party, when he addressed an audience of ten thousand people in\r\nthe Albert Hall in London. In the course of a masterly analysis of the\r\ndangers inseparable from Home Rule, he once more drew attention to \"the\r\ndishonesty with which the Government hid Home Rule before the election,\r\nand now propose to carry it after the election\"; but the passage which\r\ngave the greatest satisfaction in Ulster was that in which, speaking for\r\nthe whole Unionist Party--which meant at least half, and probably more\r\nthan half, the British nation--Mr. Bonar Law, in reference to the recent\r\noccurrence in Belfast, said:\r\n\r\n     \"We hear a great deal about the intolerance of Ulster. It is easy\r\n     to be tolerant for other people. We who represent the Unionist\r\n     Party in England and Scotland have supported, and we mean to\r\n     support to the end, the loyal minority. We support them not because\r\n     we are intolerant, but because their claims are just.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Churchill's friends were seeking a building in Belfast\r\nwhere the baffled Minister could hold his meeting on the 8th of\r\nFebruary, and in the course of the search the director of the Belfast\r\nOpera-house was offered a knighthood as well as a large sum of money for\r\nthe use of his theatre,[20] a fact that possibly explains the statement\r\nmade by the London Correspondent of _The Freeman's Journal_ on the 28th\r\nof January, that the Government's Chief Whip and Patronage Secretary was\r\nbusying himself with the arrangement.[21] Captain Frederick Guest, M.P.,\r\none of the junior whips, arrived in Belfast on the 25th to give\r\nassistance on the spot; but no suitable hall with an auspicious _genius\r\nloci_ could apparently be found, for eventually a marquee was imported\r\nfrom Scotland and erected on the Celtic football ground, in the\r\nNationalist quarter of the city.\r\n\r\nThe question of maintaining order on the day of the meeting was at the\r\nsame time engaging the attention both of the Government in Dublin and\r\nthe Unionist Council in Belfast. The former decided to strengthen the\r\ngarrison of Belfast by five battalions of infantry and two squadrons of\r\ncavalry, while at the Old Town Hall anxious consultations were held as\r\nto the best means of securing that the soldiers should have nothing to\r\ndo. The Unionist leaders had not yet gained the full influence they were\r\nable to exercise later, nor were their followers as disciplined as they\r\nafterwards became. The Orange Lodges were the only section of the\r\npopulation in any sense under discipline; and this section was a much\r\nsmaller proportion of the Unionist rank and file than English Liberals\r\nsupposed, who were in the habit of speaking as if \"Orangemen\" were a\r\ncorrect cognomen of the whole Protestant population of Ulster. It was,\r\nhowever, only through the Lodges and the Unionist Clubs that the\r\nStanding Committee could hope to exert influence in keeping the peace.\r\nThat Committee, accordingly, passed a Resolution on the 5th of February,\r\nmoved by Colonel Wallace, the most influential of the Belfast\r\nOrangemen, which \"strongly urged all Unionists,\" in view of the Ulster\r\nHall victory, \"to abstain from any interference with the meeting at the\r\nCeltic football ground, and to do everything in their power to avoid any\r\naction that might lead to any disturbance.\"\r\n\r\nThe Resolution was circulated to all the Orange Lodges and Unionist\r\nClubs in Belfast and the neighbouring districts--for it was expected\r\nthat some 30,000 or 40,000 people might come into the city from outside\r\non the day of the meeting--with urgent injunctions to the officers to\r\nbring it to the notice of all members; it was also extensively placarded\r\non all the hoardings of Belfast. Of even greater importance perhaps, in\r\nthe interests of peace, was the decision that Carson and Londonderry\r\nshould themselves remain in Belfast on the 8th. This, as _The Times_\r\nCorrespondent in Belfast had the insight to observe, was \"the strongest\r\nguarantee of order\" that could be given, and there is no doubt that\r\ntheir appearance, together with Captain Craig, M.P., and Lord\r\nTempletown, on the balcony of the Ulster Club had a calming effect on\r\nthe excited crowd that surged round Mr. Churchill's hotel, and served as\r\na reminder throughout the day of the advice which these leaders had\r\nissued to their adherents.\r\n\r\nThe First Lord of the Admiralty was accompanied to Belfast by Mrs.\r\nChurchill, his Secretary, and two Liberal Members of Parliament, Mr.\r\nFiennes and Mr. Hamar Greenwood--for the last-mentioned of whom fate was\r\nreserving a more intimate connection with Irish trouble than could be\r\ngot from a fleeting flirtation with disloyalty in West Belfast. They\r\nwere greeted at Larne by a large crowd vociferously cheering Carson, and\r\nsinging the National Anthem. A still larger concourse of people, though\r\nit could not be more hostile, awaited Mr. Churchill at the Midland\r\nStation in Belfast and along the route to the Grand Central Hotel. When\r\nhe started from the hotel early in the afternoon for the football field\r\nthe crowd in Royal Avenue was densely packed and actively demonstrating\r\nits unfavourable opinion of the distinguished visitor; on whom, however,\r\nnone desired or attempted to inflict any physical injury, although the\r\ninvoluntary swaying of so great a mass of men was in danger for a\r\nmoment of overturning the motor-car in which he and his wife were\r\nseated.\r\n\r\nThe way to the meeting took the Minister from the Unionist to the\r\nNationalist district and afforded him a practical demonstration of the\r\ngulf between the \"two nations\" which he and his colleagues were bent\r\nupon treating as one. The moment he crossed the boundary, the booing and\r\ngroaning of one area was succeeded by enthusiastic cheers in the other;\r\ngrotesque effigies of Redmond and of himself in one street were replaced\r\nby equally unflattering effigies of Londonderry and Carson in the next;\r\nin Royal Avenue both men and women looked like tearing him in pieces, in\r\nFalls Road they thronged so close to shake his hand that \"Mr. Hamar\r\nGreenwood found it necessary\" (so the _Times_ Correspondent reported)\r\n\"to stand on the footboard outside the car and relieve the pressure.\"\r\n\r\nIt was expected that Mr. Churchill would return to his hotel after the\r\nmeeting, and there had been no shrinkage in the crowd in the interval,\r\nnor any change in its sentiments. The police decided that it would be\r\nwiser for him to depart by another route. He was therefore taken by back\r\nstreets to the Midland terminus, and without waiting for the ordinary\r\ntrain by which he had arranged to travel, was as hastily as possible\r\ndespatched to Larne by a special train before it was generally known\r\nthat Royal Avenue and York Street were to see him no more. Mr. Churchill\r\ntells us in his brilliant biography of his father that when Lord\r\nRandolph arrived at Larne in 1886 \"he was welcomed like a King.\" His own\r\narrival at the same port was anything but regal, and his departure more\r\nresembled that of the \"thief in the night,\" of whom Lord Randolph had\r\nbidden Ulster beware.\r\n\r\nSo this memorable pilgrimage ended. Of the speech itself which Mr.\r\nChurchill delivered to some thousands of Nationalists, many of whom were\r\nbrought by special train from Dublin, it is unnecessary here to say more\r\nthan that Sir Edward Carson described it a few days later as a \"speech\r\nfull of eloquent platitudes,\" and that it certainly did little to\r\nsatisfy the demand for information about the Home Rule Bill which was to\r\nbe produced in the coming session of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe undoubted importance which this visit of Mr. Churchill to Belfast\r\nand its attendant circumstances had in the development of the Ulster\r\nMovement is the justification for treating it in what may appear to be\r\ndisproportionate detail. From it dates the first clear realisation even\r\nby hostile critics in England, and probably by Ministers themselves,\r\nthat the policy of Ulster as laid down at Craigavon could not be\r\ndismissed with a sneer, although it is true that there were many Home\r\nRulers who never openly abandoned the pretence that it could. Not less\r\nimportant was the effect in Ulster itself. The Unionist Council had\r\nproved itself in earnest; it could, and was prepared to, do more than\r\norganise imposing political demonstrations; and so the rank and file\r\ngained confidence in leaders who could act as well as make speeches, and\r\nwho had shown themselves in an emergency to be in thorough accord with\r\npopular sentiment; the belief grew that the men who met in the Old Town\r\nHall would know how to handle any crisis that might arise, would not\r\ntimidly shrink from acting as occasion might require, and were quite\r\nable to hold their own with the Government in tactical manoeuvres. This\r\nconfidence improved discipline. The Lodges and the Clubs and the general\r\nbody of shipyard and other workers had less temptation to take matters\r\ninto their own hands; they were content to wait for instructions from\r\nheadquarters now that they could trust their leaders to give the\r\nnecessary instructions at the proper time.\r\n\r\nThe net result, therefore, of an expedition which was designed to expose\r\nthe hollowness and the weakness of the Ulster case was to augment the\r\nprestige of the Ulster leaders and the self-confidence of the Ulster\r\npeople, and to make both leaders and followers understand better than\r\nbefore the strength of the position in which they were entrenched.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] See _ante_, p. 38.\r\n\r\n[15] _The Times_, January 18th, 1912.\r\n\r\n[16] _The Times_, January 26th, 1912.\r\n\r\n[17] _The Standard_, January 18th, 1912.\r\n\r\n[18] _The Saturday Review_, January 27th, 1912.\r\n\r\n[19] _The Times_, January 20th, 1912.\r\n\r\n[20] See Interview with Mr. F.W.

Attempts\r\nwere made to conciliate hesitating opinion by representing Irish Home\r\nRule as a step in the direction of a general federal system for the\r\nUnited Kingdom, and by tracing an analogy with the constitutions already\r\ngranted to the self-governing Dominions. Closely connected with the\r\nfederal idea was the question of finance. There was lively speculation\r\nas to what measure of control over taxation the Bill would confer on the\r\nIrish Parliament, and especially whether it would be given the power to\r\nimpose duties of Customs and Excise. Home Rulers themselves were sharply\r\ndivided on the question. At a conference held at the London School of\r\nEconomics on the 10th of January, 1912, Professor T.M. Kettle, Mr.\r\nErskine Childers, and Mr. Thomas Lough, M.P., declared themselves in\r\nfavour of Irish fiscal autonomy, while Lord Macdonnell opposed the idea\r\nas irreconcilable with the fiscal policy of Great Britain.[22] The\r\nlatter opinion was very forcibly maintained a few weeks later by a\r\nmember of the Government with some reputation as an economist. Speaking\r\nto a branch of the United Irish League in London, Mr. J.M. Robertson,\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, summarily rejected fiscal\r\nautonomy for Ireland, which, he said, \"really meant a claim for\r\nseparation.\" \"To give fiscal autonomy,\" he added, \"would mean\r\ndisintegration of the United Kingdom. Fiscal autonomy for Ireland put\r\nan end altogether to all talk of Federal Home Rule, and he could see no\r\nhope for a Home Rule Bill if it included fiscal autonomy.\"[23]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Secretary to the Board of Trade was probably not in the\r\nconfidence of the Cabinet, many people took Mr. Robertson's speech as an\r\nindication of the limits of financial control that the Bill would give\r\nto Ireland. On the same day that it was delivered the Dublin\r\nCorrespondent of _The Times_ reported that the demand of the\r\nNationalists for control of Customs and Excise was rapidly growing, and\r\nthat any Bill which withheld it, even if it could scrape through a\r\nNational Convention, \"would never survive the two succeeding years of\r\nagitation and criticism\"; and he agreed with Mr. Robertson that if, on\r\nthe other hand, fiscal autonomy should be conceded, it would destroy all\r\nprospect of a settlement on federal lines, and would \"establish virtual\r\nseparation between Ireland and Great Britain.\" He predicted that\r\n\"Ulster, of course, would resist to the bitter end.\"[24]\r\n\r\nUlster, in point of fact, took but a secondary interest in the question.\r\nHer people were indeed opposed to anything that would enlarge the\r\nseparation from England, or emphasise it, and, as they realised, like\r\nthe Secretary to the Board of Trade, that fiscal autonomy would have\r\nthis effect, they opposed fiscal autonomy; but they cared little about\r\nthe thing in itself one way or the other. Nor did they greatly concern\r\nthemselves whether Home Rule proceeded on federal lines or any other\r\nlines; nor whether some apt analogy could or could not be found between\r\nIreland and the Dominions of the Crown thousands of miles oversea.\r\nHaving made up their minds that no Dublin Parliament should exercise\r\njurisdiction over themselves, they did not worry themselves much about\r\nthe powers with which such a Parliament might be endowed. It is\r\nnoteworthy, however, in view of the importance which the question\r\nafterwards attained, that so early as January 1912 Sir Edward Carson,\r\nspeaking in Manchester, maintained that without fiscal autonomy Home\r\nRule was impossible,[25] and that some months later Mr. Bonar Law, in a\r\nspeech at Glasgow on the 21st of May, said that if the Unionist Party\r\nwere in a position where they had to concede Home Rule to Ireland they\r\nwould include fiscal autonomy in the grant.[26] These leaders, who,\r\nunlike the Liberal Ministers, had some knowledge of the Irish\r\ntemperament, realised from the first the absurdity of Mr. Asquith's\r\nattempt to satisfy the demands of \"the rebel party\" by offering\r\nsomething very different from what that party demanded. The Ulster\r\nleader and the leader of the Unionist Party knew as well as anybody that\r\nfiscal autonomy meant \"virtual separation between Ireland and Great\r\nBritain,\" but they also knew that separation was the ultimate aim of\r\nNationalist policy, and that there could be no finality in the Liberal\r\ncompromise; and they no doubt agreed with the forcible language used by\r\nMr. Balfour in the previous autumn, when he said that \"the rotten hybrid\r\nsystem of a Parliament with municipal duties and a national feeling\r\nseemed to be the dream of political idiots.\"\r\n\r\nThe ferment of speculation as to the Government's intentions continued\r\nduring the early weeks of the Parliamentary session, which opened on the\r\n14th of February, but all inquiries by members of the House of Commons\r\nwere met by variations on the theme \"Wait and See.\" Unionists, however,\r\nrealised that it was not in Parliament, but outside, that the only\r\neffective work could be done, in the hope of forcing a dissolution of\r\nParliament before the Bill could become law. A vigorous campaign was\r\nconducted throughout the country, especially in Lancashire, and\r\narrangements were made for a monster demonstration in Belfast, which\r\nshould serve both as a counter-blast to the Churchill fiasco, and for\r\nenabling English and Scottish Unionists to test for themselves the\r\ntemper of the Ulster resistance. In the belief that the Home Rule Bill\r\nwould be introduced before Easter, it was decided to hold this meeting\r\nin the Recess, as Mr. Bonar Law had promised to speak, and a number of\r\nEnglish Members of Parliament wished to be present. At the last moment\r\nthe Government announced that the Bill would not be presented till the\r\n11th of April, after Parliament reassembled, and its provisions were\r\ntherefore still unknown when the demonstration took place on the 9th in\r\nthe Show Ground of the Royal Agricultural Society at Balmoral, a suburb\r\nof Belfast.\r\n\r\nFeeling ran high as the date of the double event approached, and the\r\nindignant sense of wrong that prevailed in Ulster was finely voiced in a\r\npoem, entitled \"Ulster 1912,\" written by Mr. Kipling for the occasion\r\nwhich appeared in _The Morning Post_ on the day of the Balmoral\r\ndemonstration, of which the first and last stanzas were:\r\n\r\n    \"The dark eleventh hour\r\n    Draws on, and sees us sold\r\n    To every evil Power\r\n    We fought against of old.\r\n    Rebellion, rapine, hate,\r\n    Oppression, wrong, and greed\r\n    Are loosed to rule our fate,\r\n    By England's act and deed.\r\n\r\n    \"Believe, we dare not boast,\r\n    Believe, we do not fear--\r\n    We stand to pay the cost\r\n    In all that men hold dear.\r\n    What answer from the North?\r\n    One Law, One Land, One Throne.\r\n    If England drive us forth\r\n    We shall not fall alone!\"\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the Unionist leader's coming visit to Belfast had\r\nexcited the keenest interest throughout England and Scotland. Coinciding\r\nas it did with the introduction of the Government's Bill, it was\r\nrecognised to be the formal countersigning by the whole Unionist Party\r\nof Great Britain of Ulster's proclamation of her determination to resist\r\nher forcible degradation in constitutional status. The same note of\r\nmingled reproach and defiance which sounded in Kipling's verses was\r\nheard in the grave warning addressed by _The Times_ to the country in a\r\nleading article on the morning of the meeting:\r\n\r\n     \"Nobody of common judgment and common knowledge of political\r\n     movements can honestly doubt the exceptional gravity of the\r\n     occasion, and least of all can any such doubt be felt by any who\r\n     know the men of Ulster. To make light of the deep-rooted\r\n     convictions which fill the minds of those who will listen to Mr.\r\n     Bonar Law to-day is a shallow and an idle affectation, or a token\r\n     of levity and of ignorance. Enlightened Liberalism may smile at the\r\n     beliefs and the passions of the Ulster Protestants, but it was\r\n     those same beliefs and passions, in the forefathers of the men who\r\n     will gather in Belfast to-day, which saved Ireland for the British\r\n     Crown, and freed the cause of civil and religious liberty in these\r\n     islands from its last dangerous foes.... It is useless to argue\r\n     that they are mistaken. They have reasons, never answered yet, for\r\n     believing that they are not mistaken.... Their temper is an\r\n     ultimate fact which British statesmen and British citizens have to\r\n     face. These men cannot be persuaded to submit to Home Rule. Are\r\n     Englishmen and Scotchmen prepared to fasten it upon them by\r\n     military force? That is the real Ulster question.\"\r\n\r\nOther great English newspapers wrote in similar strain, and the support\r\nthus given was of the greatest possible encouragement to the Ulster\r\npeople, who were thereby assured that their standpoint was not\r\nmisunderstood and that the justice of their \"loyalist\" claims was\r\nappreciated across the Channel.\r\n\r\nAmong the numberless popular demonstrations which marked the history of\r\nUlster's stand against Home Rule, four stand out pre-eminent in the\r\nimpressiveness of their size and character. Those who attended the\r\nUlster Convention of 1892 were persuaded that no political meeting could\r\never be more inspiring; but many of them lived to acknowledge that it\r\nwas far surpassed at Craigavon in 1911. The Craigavon meeting, though in\r\nsome respects as important as any of the series, was, from a spectacular\r\npoint of view, much less imposing than the assemblage which listened to\r\nMr. Bonar Law at Balmoral on Easter Tuesday, 1912; and the latter\r\noccasion, though never surpassed in splendour and magnitude by any\r\nsingle gathering, was in significance but a prelude to the magnificent\r\nclimax reached in the following September on the day when the Covenant\r\nwas signed throughout Ulster.\r\n\r\nThe Balmoral demonstration had, however, one distinctive feature. At it\r\nthe Unionist Party of Great Britain met and grasped the hand of Ulster\r\nLoyalism. It gave the leader and a large number of his followers an\r\nopportunity to judge for themselves the strength and sincerity of\r\nUlster, and at the same time it served to show the Ulstermen the weight\r\nof British opinion ready to back them. Mr. Bonar Law was accompanied to\r\nBelfast by no less than seventy Members of Parliament, representing\r\nEnglish, Scottish, and Welsh constituencies, not a few of whom had\r\nalready attained, or afterwards rose to, political distinction. Among\r\nthem were Mr. Walter Long, Lord Hugh Cecil, Sir Robert Finlay, Lord\r\nCharles Beresford, Lord Castlereagh, Mr. Amery, Mr. J.D. Baird, Sir\r\nArthur Griffith-Boscawen, Mr. Ian Malcolm, Lord Claud Hamilton, Mr. J.G.\r\nButcher, Mr. Ernest Pollock, Mr. George Cave, Mr. Felix Cassel, Mr.\r\nOrmsby-Gore, Mr. Scott Dickson, Mr. W. Peel, Captain Gilmour, Mr. George\r\nLloyd, Mr. J.W. Hills, Mr. George Lane-Fox, Mr. Stuart-Wortley, Mr.\r\nJ.F.P. Rawlinson, Mr. H.J. Mackinder, and Mr. Herbert Nield.\r\n\r\nThe reception of the Unionist Leader at Larne on Easter Monday was\r\nwonderful, even to those who knew what a Larne welcome to loyalist\r\nleaders could be, and who recalled the scenes there during the historic\r\nvisits of Lord Randolph Churchill, Lord Salisbury, and Mr. Balfour. \"If\r\nthis is how you treat your friends,\" said Mr. Bonar Law simply, in reply\r\nto one of the innumerable addresses presented to him, \"I am glad I am\r\nnot an enemy.\" Before reaching Belfast he had ample opportunity at every\r\nstopping-place of his train to note the fervour of the populace. \"Are\r\nall these people landlords?\" he asked (in humorous allusion to the\r\nLiberal legend that Ulster Unionism was manufactured by a few\r\naristocratic landowners), as he saw every platform thronged with\r\nenthusiastic crowds of men and women, the majority of whom were\r\nevidently of the poorer classes. In Belfast the concourse of people was\r\nso dense in the streets that the motor-car in which Mr. Bonar Law and\r\nSir Edward Carson sat side by side found it difficult to make its way\r\nto the Reform Club, the headquarters of what had once been Ulster\r\nLiberalism, where an address was presented in which it was stated that\r\nthe conduct of the Government \"will justify loyal Ulster in resorting to\r\nthe most extreme measures in resisting Home Rule.\" In his reply Mr.\r\nBonar Law gave them \"on behalf of the Unionist Party this\r\nmessage--though the brunt of the battle will be yours, there will not be\r\nwanting help from 'across the Channel.'\" At Comber, where a stop was\r\nmade on the way to Mount Stewart, he asked himself how Radical Scotsmen\r\nwould like to be treated as the Government were treating Protestant\r\nUlster. \"I know Scotland well,\" he replied to his own question, \"and I\r\nbelieve that, rather than submit to such fate, the Scottish people would\r\nface a second Bannockburn or a second Flodden.\"\r\n\r\nThese few quotations from the first utterances of Mr. Bonar Law on his\r\narrival are sufficient to show how complete was the understanding\r\nbetween him and the Ulster people even before the great demonstration of\r\nthe following day. He had, as _The Times_ Correspondent noted, \"already\r\nfound favour with the Belfast crowd. All the way from Larne by train to\r\nBelfast and through Belfast by motor-car to Newtownards and Mount\r\nStewart, his progress was a triumph.\"\r\n\r\nThe remarks of the same experienced observer on the eve of the Balmoral\r\nmeeting are worth recording, especially as his anticipations were amply\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n     \"To-morrow's demonstration,\" he telegraphed from Belfast, \"both in\r\n     numbers and enthusiasm, promises to be the most remarkable ever\r\n     seen in Ireland. If expectations are realised the assemblage of men\r\n     will be twice as numerous as the whole white population of the\r\n     Witwatersrand, whose grievances led to the South African War, and\r\n     they will represent a community greater in numbers than the white\r\n     population of South Africa as a whole. Unless all the signs are\r\n     misleading, it will be the demonstration of a community in the\r\n     deadliest earnest. By the Protestant community of Ulster, Home Rule\r\n     is regarded as a menace to their faith, to their material\r\n     well-being and prosperity, and to their freedom and national\r\n     traditions, and thus all the most potent motives which in history\r\n     have stirred men to their greatest efforts are here in operation.\"\r\n\r\nNo written description, unless by the pen of some gifted imaginative\r\nwriter, could convey any true impression of the scenes that were\r\nwitnessed the following day in the Show Ground at Balmoral and the roads\r\nleading to it from the heart of the city. The photographs published at\r\nthe time give some idea of the apparently unbounded ocean of earnest,\r\nupturned faces, closely packed round the several platforms, and\r\nstretching away far into a dim and distant background; but even they\r\ncould not record the impressive stillness of the vast multitude, its\r\norderliness, which required the presence of not a single policeman, its\r\nspirit of almost religious solemnity which struck every observant\r\nonlooker. No profusion of superlative adjectives can avail to reproduce\r\nsuch scenes, any more than words, no matter how skilfully chosen, can\r\nconvey the tone of a violin in the hands of a master. Even the mere\r\nnumber of those who took part in the demonstration cannot be guessed\r\nwith any real accuracy. There was a procession of men, whose fine\r\nphysique and military smartness were noticed by visitors from England,\r\nwhich was reported to have taken three hours to pass a given point\r\nmarching in fours, and was estimated to be not less than 100,000 strong,\r\nwhile those who went independently to the ground or crowded the route\r\nwere reckoned to be at least as many more. The Correspondent of _The\r\nTimes_ declared that \"it was hardly by hyperbole that Sir Edward Carson\r\nclaimed that it was one of the largest assemblies in the history of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nBut the moral effect of such gatherings is not to be gauged by numbers\r\nalone. The demeanour of the people, which no organisation or stage\r\nmanagement could influence, impressed the English journalists and\r\nMembers of Parliament even more than the gigantic scale of the\r\ndemonstration. There was not a trace of the picnic spirit. There was no\r\ndrunkenness, no noisy buffoonery, no unseemly behaviour. The Ulster\r\nhabit of combining politics and prayer--which was not departed from at\r\nBalmoral, where the proceedings were opened by the Primate of All\r\nIreland and the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church--was jeered at by\r\npeople who never witnessed an Ulster loyalist meeting; but the Editor of\r\n_The Observer_, himself a Roman Catholic, remarked with more insight\r\nthat \"the Protestant mind does not use prayer simply as part of a\r\nparade;\" and _The Times_ Correspondent, who has already been more than\r\nonce quoted, was struck by the fervour with which at Balmoral \"the whole\r\nof the vast gathering joined in singing the 90th Psalm,\" and he added\r\nthe very just comment that \"it is the custom in Ulster to mark in this\r\nsolemn manner the serious nature of the issue when the Union is the\r\nquestion, as something different from a question of mere party\r\npolitics.\"\r\n\r\nThe spectacular aspect of the demonstration was admirably managed. A\r\nsaluting point was so arranged that the procession, on entering the\r\nenclosure, could divide into two columns, one passing each side of a\r\nsmall pavilion where Mr. Bonar Law, Sir Edward Carson, Lord Londonderry,\r\nand Mr. Walter Long stood to take the salute before proceeding to the\r\nstand which held the principal platform for the delivery of the\r\nspeeches. In the centre of the ground was a signalling-tower with a\r\nflagstaff 90 feet high, on which a Union Jack measuring 48 feet by 25\r\nand said to be the largest ever woven, was broken at the moment when the\r\nResolution against Home Rule was put to the meeting.\r\n\r\nMr. Bonar Law, visibly moved by the scene before him, made a speech that\r\nprofoundly affected his audience, although it was characteristically\r\nfree from rhetorical display. A recent incident in Dublin, where the\r\nsight of the British Flag flying within view of a Nationalist meeting\r\nhad been denounced as \"an intolerable insult,\" supplied him, when he\r\ncompared it with the spectacle presented by the meeting, with an apt\r\nillustration of the contrast between \"the two nations\" in Ireland--the\r\nloyal and the disloyal. He told the Ulstermen that he had come to them\r\nas the leader of the Unionist Party to give them the assurance that\r\n\"that party regard your cause, not as yours alone, nor as ours alone,\r\nbut as the cause of the Empire\"; the meeting, which he had expected to\r\nbe a great gathering but which far exceeded his expectation, proved\r\nthat Ulster's hostility to Home Rule, far from having slackened, as\r\nenemies had alleged, had increased and solidified with the passing\r\nyears; they were men \"animated by a unity of purpose, by a fixity of\r\nresolution which nothing can shake and which must prove irresistible,\"\r\nto whom he would apply Cromwell's words to his Ironsides: \"You are men\r\nwho know what you are fighting for, and love what you know.\" Then, after\r\nan analysis of the practical evils that Home Rule would engender and the\r\nbenefits which legislative union secured, he again emphasised the lack\r\nof mandate for the Government policy. His hearers, he said, \"knew the\r\nshameful story\": how the Radicals had twice failed to obtain the\r\nsanction of the British people for Home Rule, \"and now for the third\r\ntime they were trying to carry it not only without the sanction, but\r\nagainst the will, of the British people.\"\r\n\r\nThe peroration which followed made an irresistible appeal to a people\r\nalways mindful of the glories of the relief of Derry. Mr. Bonar Law\r\nwarned them that the Ministerial majority in the House of Commons, \"now\r\ncemented by £400 a year,\" could not be broken up, but would have their\r\nown way. He therefore said to them:\r\n\r\n     \"With all solemnity--you must trust in yourselves. Once again you\r\n     hold the pass--the pass for the Empire. You are a besieged city.\r\n     The timid have left you; your Lundys have betrayed you; but you\r\n     have closed your gates. The Government have erected by their\r\n     Parliament Act a boom against you to shut you off from the help of\r\n     the British people. You will burst that boom. That help will come,\r\n     and when the crisis is over men will say to you in words not unlike\r\n     those used by Pitt--you have saved yourselves by your exertions and\r\n     you will save the Empire by your example.\"\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming ovation with which Sir Edward Carson was received upon\r\ntaking the president's chair at the chief platform, in the absence\r\nthrough illness of the Duke of Abercorn, proved that he had already won\r\nthe confidence and the affection of the Ulster people to a degree that\r\nseemed to leave little room for growth, although every subsequent\r\nappearance he made among them in the years that lay ahead seemed to add\r\nintensity to their demonstrations of personal devotion. The most\r\ndramatic moment at Balmoral--if for once the word so hackneyed and\r\nmisused by journalists may be given its true signification--the most\r\ndramatic moment was when the Ulster leader and the leader of the whole\r\nUnionist Party each grasped the other's hand in view of the assembled\r\nmultitude, as though formally ratifying a compact made thus publicly on\r\nthe eve of battle. It was the consummation of the purpose of this\r\nassembly of the Unionist hosts on Ulster soil, and gave assurance of\r\nunity of aim and undivided command in the coming struggle.\r\n\r\nOf the other speeches delivered, many of them of a high quality,\r\nespecially, perhaps, those of Lord Hugh Cecil, Sir Robert Finlay, and\r\nMr. Scott Dickson, it is enough to say that they all conveyed the same\r\nmessage of encouragement to Ulster, the same promise of undeviating\r\nsupport. One detail, however, deserves mention, because it shows the\r\ndirection in which men's thoughts were then moving. Mr. Walter Long,\r\nwhose great services to the cause of the Union procured him a welcome\r\nsecond in warmth to that of no other leader, after thanking Londonderry\r\nand Carson \"for the great lead they have given us in recent difficult\r\nweeks \"--an allusion to the Churchill incident that was not lost on the\r\naudience--added with a blunt directness characteristic of the speaker:\r\n\"If they are going to put Lord Londonderry and Sir Edward Carson into\r\nthe dock, they will have to find one large enough to hold the whole\r\nUnionist Party.\"\r\n\r\nThe Balmoral demonstration was recognised on all sides as one of the\r\nchief landmarks in the Ulster Movement. The Craigavon policy was not\r\nonly reaffirmed with greater emphasis than before by the people of\r\nUlster themselves, but it received the deliberate endorsement of the\r\nUnionist Party in England and Scotland. Moreover, as Mr. Long's speech\r\nexplicitly promised, and Mr. Bonar Law's speech unmistakably implied,\r\nBritish support was not to be dependent on Ulster's opposition to Home\r\nRule being kept within strictly legal limits. Indeed, it had become\r\nincreasingly evident that opposition so limited must be impotent, since,\r\nas Mr. Bonar Law pointed out, Ministers and their majority in the House\r\nof Commons were in Mr. Redmond's pocket, and had no choice but to \"toe\r\nthe line,\" while the \"boom\" which they had erected by the Parliament Act\r\ncut off Ulster from access to the British constituencies, unless that\r\nboom could be burst as the boom across the Foyle was broken by the\r\n_Mountjoy_ in 1689. The Unionist leader had warned the Ulstermen that\r\nin these circumstances they must expect nothing from Parliament, but\r\nmust trust in themselves. They did not mistake his meaning, and they\r\nwere quite ready to take his advice.\r\n\r\nComing, as it did, two days before the introduction of the Government's\r\nBill, the Balmoral demonstration profoundly influenced opinion in the\r\ncountry. The average Englishman, when his political party is in a\r\nminority, damns the Government, shrugs his shoulders, and goes on his\r\nway, not rejoicing indeed, but with apathetic resignation till the\r\npendulum swings again. He now awoke to the fact that the Ulstermen meant\r\nbusiness. He realised that a political crisis of the first magnitude was\r\nvisible on the horizon. The vague talk about \"civil war\" began to look\r\nas if it might have something in it, and it was evident that the\r\nprovisions of the forthcoming Bill, about which there had been so much\r\neager anticipation, would be of quite secondary importance since neither\r\nthe Cabinet nor the House of Commons would have the last word.\r\n\r\nSupporters of the Government in the Press could think of nothing better\r\nto do in these circumstances than to pour out abuse, occasionally varied\r\nby ridicule, on the Unionist leaders, of which Sir Edward Carson came in\r\nfor the most generous portion. He was by turns everything that was bad,\r\ndangerous, and absurd, from Mephistopheles to a madman. \"F.C.G.\"\r\nsummarised the Balmoral meeting pictorially in a _Westminster Gazette_\r\ncartoon as a costermonger's donkey-cart in which Carson, Londonderry,\r\nand Bonar Law, refreshed by \"Orangeade,\" took \"an Easter Jaunt in\r\nUlster,\" and other caricaturists used their pencils with less humour and\r\nmore malice with the same object of belittling the demonstration with\r\nridicule. But ridicule is not so potent a weapon in England or in Ulster\r\nas it is said to be in France. It did nothing to weaken the Ulster\r\ncause; it even strengthened it in some ways. It was about this time that\r\nhostile writers began to refer to \"King Carson,\" and to represent him as\r\nexercising regal sway over his \"subjects\" in Ulster. Those \"subjects\"\r\nwere delighted; they took it as a compliment to their leader's position\r\nand power, and did not in the least resent the role assigned to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, they did resent very hotly the vulgar insolence often\r\nlevelled at their \"Sir Edward.\" He himself was always quite indifferent\r\nto it, sometimes even amused by it. On one occasion, when something\r\nparticularly outrageous had appeared with reference to him in some\r\nRadical paper, he delighted a public meeting by solemnly reading the\r\npassage, and when the angry cries of \"Shame, shame\" had subsided, saying\r\nwith a smile: \"This sort of thing is only the manure that fertilises my\r\nreputation with you who know me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that was true. If Home Rulers, whether in Ireland or in Great\r\nBritain, ever seriously thought of conciliating Ulster, as Mr. Redmond\r\nprofessed to desire, they never made a greater mistake than in saying\r\nand writing insulting things about Carson. It only endeared him more and\r\nmore to his followers, and it intensified the bitterness of their\r\nfeeling against the Nationalists and all their works. An almost equally\r\nshort-sighted error on the part of hostile critics was the idea that the\r\nattitude of Ulster as exhibited at Craigavon and Balmoral should be\r\nrepresented as mere bluster and bluff, to which the only proper reply\r\nwas contempt. There never was anything further removed from the truth,\r\nas anyone ought to have known who had the smallest acquaintance with\r\nIrish history or with the character of the race that had supplied the\r\nbackbone of Washington's army; but, if there had been at any time an\r\nelement of bluff in their attitude, their contemptuous critics took the\r\nsurest means of converting it into grim earnestness of purpose. Mr.\r\nRedmond himself was ill-advised enough to set an example in this\r\nrespect. In an article published by _Reynold's Newspaper_ in January he\r\nhad scoffed at the \"stupid, hollow, and unpatriotic bellowings\" of the\r\nLoyalists in Belfast. Some few opponents had enough sense to take a\r\ndifferent line in their comments on Balmoral. One article in particular\r\nwhich appeared in _The Star_ on the day of the demonstration attracted\r\nmuch attention for this reason.\r\n\r\n     \"We have never yielded,\" it said, \"to the temptation to deride or\r\n     to belittle the resistance of Ulster to Home Rule.... The\r\n     subjugation of Protestant Ulster by force is one of those things\r\n     that do not happen in our politics.... It is, we know, a popular\r\n     delusion that Ulster is a braggart whose words are empty bluff. We\r\n     are convinced that Ulster means what she says, and that she will\r\n     make good every one of her warnings.\"\r\n\r\n_The Star_ went on to implore Liberals not to be driven \"into an\r\nattitude of bitter hostility to the Ulster Protestants,\" with whom it\r\ndeclared they had much in common.\r\n\r\nAfter Balmoral there was certainly more disposition than before on the\r\npart of Liberal Home Rulers to acknowledge the sincerity of Ulster and\r\nthe gravity of the position created by her opposition, and this\r\ndisposition showed itself in the debates on the Bill; but, speaking\r\ngenerally, the warning of _The Star_ was disregarded by its political\r\nadherents, and its neglect contributed not a little to the embitterment\r\nof the controversy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] _Annual Register_, 1912, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[23] _The Times_, February 3rd, 1912.\r\n\r\n[24] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[25] _Annual Register_, 1912, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[26] Ibid., p. 126.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE EXCLUSION OF ULSTER\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin forty-eight hours of the Balmoral meeting the Prime Minister\r\nmoved for leave to introduce the third Home Rule Bill in the House of\r\nCommons. Carson immediately stated the Ulster case in a powerful speech\r\nwhich left no room for doubt that, while every clause in the Bill would\r\nbe contested, it was the setting up of an executive administration\r\nresponsible to a Parliament in Dublin--that is to say, the central\r\nprinciple of the measure--that would be most strenuously opposed.\r\n\r\nThere is no occasion here to explain in detail the proposals contained\r\nin Mr. Asquith's Home Rule Bill. They form part of the general history\r\nof the period, and are accessible to all who care to examine them. Our\r\nconcern is with the endeavour of Ulster to prevent, if possible, the\r\npassage of the Bill to the Statute-book, and, if that should prove\r\nimpracticable, to prevent its enforcement \"in those districts of which\r\nthey had control.\" But one or two points that were made in the course of\r\nthe debates which occupied Parliament for the rest of the year 1912\r\nclaim a moment's notice in their bearing on the subject in hand.\r\n\r\nMr. Bonar Law lost no time in fully redeeming the promises he made at\r\nBalmoral. Challenged to repeat in Parliament the charges he had made\r\nagainst the Government in Ulster, he not only repeated them with\r\nemphasis, but by closely-knit reasoning justified them with chapter and\r\nverse. As to Balmoral, \"it really was not like a political\r\ndemonstration; it was the expression of the soul of a people.\" He\r\ndeclared that \"the gulf between the two peoples in Ireland was really\r\nfar wider than the gulf between Ireland and Great Britain.\" He then\r\ndealt specifically with the threatened resistance of Ulster. \"These\r\npeople in Ulster,\" he said, \"are under no illusion. They know they\r\ncannot fight the British Army. The people of Ulster know that, if the\r\nsoldiers receive orders to shoot, it will be their duty to obey. They\r\nwill have no ill-will against them for obeying. But they are ready, in\r\nwhat they believe to be the cause of justice and liberty, to lay down\r\ntheir lives. How are you going to overcome that resistance? Do\r\nHonourable Members believe that any Prime Minister could give orders to\r\nshoot down men whose only crime is that they refuse to be driven out of\r\nour community and be deprived of the privilege of British citizenship?\r\nThe thing is impossible. All your talk about details, the union of\r\nhearts and the rest of it, is a sham. This is a reality. It is a rock,\r\nand on that rock this Bill will inevitably make shipwreck.\"\r\n\r\nThe Unionist leader then made a searching exposure of the traffic and\r\nbargaining between the Cabinet and the Nationalists by which the support\r\nof the latter had been bought for a Budget which they hated, the price\r\npaid being the Premier's improper advice to the Crown, leading to the\r\nmutilation of the Constitution; the acknowledgment in the preamble to\r\nthe Parliament Act that an immediate reform of the Second Chamber was a\r\n\"debt of honour\"; the omission to redeem that debt, which had provided a\r\nnew proverb--\"Lying as a preamble\"; and, finally, the determination to\r\ncarry Home Rule after deliberately keeping it out of sight during the\r\nelections. The Prime Minister's \"debt of honour must wait until he has\r\npaid his debt of shame\"; and the latter debt was being paid by the\r\nproposals they were then debating. If those proposals had been submitted\r\nto the electors, \"there would be a difference,\" said Mr. Bonar Law,\r\n\"between the Unionists in England and the Unionists in Ireland. Now\r\nthere is none. We can imagine nothing which the Unionists in Ireland can\r\ndo which will not be justified against a trick of this kind.\"\r\n\r\nDissatisfaction with the financial clauses of the Bill was expressed at\r\nonce by the General Council of County Councils in Ireland, a purely\r\nNationalist body; but on the 23rd of April a Nationalist Convention in\r\nDublin, under the influence of Mr. Redmond's oratory, accepted the whole\r\nof the Government's proposals with enthusiasm. The first and second\r\nreadings of the Bill were duly carried by the normal Government majority\r\nof about a hundred Liberal, Labour, and Irish Nationalist votes, and the\r\ncommittee stage opened on the 11th of June. On that day an amendment was\r\ndown for debate which required the most careful consideration by the\r\nrepresentatives of Ulster, since their attitude now might have an\r\nimportant bearing on their future policy, and a false step at this stage\r\nmight easily prove embarrassing later on. The author of this amendment\r\nwas Mr. Agar-Robartes, a Cornish Liberal Member, whose proposal was to\r\nexclude the four counties of Antrim, Derry, Down, and Armagh from the\r\njurisdiction of the proposed Irish Parliament, a gratifying proof that\r\nCraigavon and Balmoral were bearing fruit.\r\n\r\nA conference of Ulster Members and Peers, and some English Members\r\nclosely identified with Irish affairs, of whom Mr. Walter Long was one,\r\nmet at Londonderry House before the sitting of the House on the 11th of\r\nJune to decide what course to take on this proposal.\r\n\r\nIt was not surprising to find that there were sharp differences of\r\nopinion among those present, for there were obvious objections to\r\nsupporting the amendment and equally obvious objections to voting\r\nagainst it. The opposition of Ulster for more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury had been directed against Home Rule for any part of Ireland and\r\nin any shape or form. No suggestion had ever been made by any of her\r\nspokesmen that the Protestant North, or any part of it, should be dealt\r\nwith separately from the rest of the island, although Carson and others\r\nhad pointed out that all the arguments in support of Home Rule were\r\nequally valid for treating Ulster as a unit. There were both economic\r\nand administrative difficulties in such a scheme which were sufficiently\r\nobvious, though by no means insuperable; but what weighed far more\r\nheavily in the minds of the Ulster members was the anticipation that\r\ntheir acceptance of the proposal would probably be represented by\r\nenemies as a desertion of all the Irish Loyalists outside the four\r\ncounties named in the amendment, with whom there was in every part of\r\nUlster the most powerful sentiment of solidarity. The idea of taking any\r\naction apart from these friends and associates, and of adopting a policy\r\nthat might seem to imply the abandonment of their opposition to the main\r\nprinciple of the Bill, was one that could not be entertained except\r\nunder the most compelling necessity.\r\n\r\nBut, had not that necessity now arisen? The Ulster members had to keep\r\nin view the ultimate policy to which they were already committed. That\r\npolicy, as laid down at Craigavon, was to take over, in the event of the\r\nHome Rule Bill being carried, the government \"of those districts which\r\nthey could control\" in trust for the Imperial Parliament, and to resist\r\nby force if necessary the establishment of the Dublin jurisdiction over\r\nthose districts. The policy of resistance was always recognised as being\r\nstrictly limited in area; no one ever supposed that Ulster could\r\nforcibly resist Home Rule being set up in the south and west. The\r\nlikelihood of failure to bring about a dissolution before the Bill\r\nbecame law had to be faced, and if no General Election took place there\r\nwould be no alternative to resistance. If, then, it were decided to vote\r\nagainst an amendment offering salvation to the four most loyalist\r\ncounties, what would be their position if ultimately driven to take up\r\narms? Except as to a matter of detail concerning the precise area\r\nproposed to be excluded from the Bill, would they not be told that they\r\nwere fighting for what they might have had by legislation, and what they\r\nhad deliberately refused to accept? And if they so acted, could they\r\nexpect not to forfeit the support of the great and growing volume of\r\npublic opinion which now sympathised with Ulster? They could not, of\r\ncourse, secure themselves against malicious misrepresentation of their\r\nmotives, but the Ulster members sincerely believed, and many in the\r\nSouth shared the opinion, that if it came to the worst they could be of\r\nmore use to the Southern Unionists outside a Dublin Parliament than as\r\nmembers of it, where they would be an impotent minority. Moreover, it\r\nwas perfectly understood that Ulster was resolved in any case not to\r\nenter a legislature in College Green, and there would, therefore, be no\r\nmore \"desertion\" of Unionists outside the excluded area if the exclusion\r\nwere effected by an amendment to the Bill, than if it were the result of\r\nwhat Mr. Bonar Law had called \"trusting to themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe considerations thus briefly summarised were thoroughly discussed in\r\nall their bearings at the conference at Londonderry House. It was one of\r\nmany occasions when Sir Edward Carson's colleagues had an opportunity of\r\nperceiving how his penetrating intellect explored the intricate windings\r\nof a complicated political problem, weighing all the alternatives of\r\nprocedure with a clear insight into the appearance that any line of\r\nconduct would present to other and perhaps hostile minds, calculating\r\nlike a chess-master move and counter-move far ahead of the present, and,\r\nwhile adhering undeviatingly to principle, using the judgment of a\r\nconsummate strategist to decide upon the action to be taken at any given\r\nmoment. He had an astonishing faculty of discarding everything that was\r\nunessential and fastening on the thing that really mattered in any\r\nsituation. His strength in counsel lay in the rare combination of these\r\nqualities of the trained lawyer with the gift of intuition, which women\r\nclaim as their distinguishing characteristic; and it often extorted from\r\nNationalists the melancholy admission that if Carson had been on their\r\nside their cause would have triumphed long ago.\r\n\r\nHis advice now was that the Agar-Robartes amendment should be supported;\r\nand, although some of those present required a good deal of persuasion,\r\nit was ultimately decided unanimously that this course should be\r\nfollowed. The wisdom of the decision was never afterwards questioned,\r\nand, indeed, was abundantly confirmed by subsequent events.\r\n\r\nMr. Agar-Robartes moved his amendment the same afternoon, summarising\r\nhis argument in the dictum, denied by Mr. William Redmond, that \"Orange\r\nbitters will not mix with Irish whisky.\" The debate, which lasted three\r\ndays, was the most important that took place in committee on the Bill,\r\nfor in the course of it the whole Ulster question was exhaustively\r\ndiscussed. Sir Edward Grey and Mr. Churchill had thrown out hints in the\r\nsecond reading debate that the Government might do something to meet the\r\nUlster case. The Prime Minister was now pressed to say what these hints\r\nmeant. Had the Government any policy in regard to Ulster? Had they\r\nconsidered how they could deal with the threatened resistance? Mr. Bonar\r\nLaw told the Government that they must know that, if they employed\r\ntroops to coerce the Ulster Loyalists, Ministers who gave the order\r\n\"would run a greater risk of being lynched in London than the Loyalists\r\nof Ulster would run of being shot in Belfast.\" Every argument in favour\r\nof Home Rule was, he said, equally cogent against subjecting Ulster to\r\nHome Rule contrary to her own desire. If the South of Ireland objected\r\nto being governed from Westminster, the North of Ireland quite as\r\nstrongly objected to being ruled from Dublin. If England, as was\r\nalleged, was incapable of governing Ireland according to Irish ideas,\r\nthe Nationalists were fully as incapable of governing the northern\r\ncounties according to Ulster ideas. If Ireland, with only one-fifteenth\r\nof the population of the United Kingdom, had a right to choose its own\r\nform of government, by what equity could the same right be denied to\r\nUlster, with one-fourth of the population of Ireland?\r\n\r\nAs had been anticipated at Londonderry House, Mr. Asquith and some of\r\nhis followers did their best to drive a wedge between the Ulstermen and\r\nthe Southern Unionists, by contending that the former, in supporting the\r\namendment, were deserting their friends. Mr. Balfour declared in answer\r\nto this that \"nothing could relieve Unionists in the rest of Ireland\r\nexcept the defeat of the measure as a whole\"; and a crushing reply was\r\ngiven by Mr. J.H. Campbell and Mr. Walter Guinness, both of whom were\r\nUnionists from the South of Ireland. Mr. Guinness frankly acknowledged\r\nthat \"it was the duty of Ulster members to take this opportunity of\r\ntrying to secure for their constituents freedom from this iniquitous\r\nmeasure. It would be merely a dog-in-the-manger policy for those who\r\nlived outside Ulster to grudge relief to their co-religionists merely\r\nbecause they could not share it. Such self-denial on Ulster's part would\r\nin no way help them (the Southerners) and it would only injure their\r\ncompatriots in the North.\"\r\n\r\nSir Edward Carson, in supporting the amendment, insisted that \"Ulster\r\nwas not asking for anything\" except to be left within the Imperial\r\nConstitution; she \"had not demanded any separate Parliament.\" He\r\naccepted the \"basic principle\" of the amendment, but would not be\r\ncontent with the four counties which alone it proposed to exclude from\r\nthe Bill. He only accepted it, however, on two assumptions--first, that\r\nthe Bill was to become law; and, second, that it was to be, as Mr.\r\nAsquith had assured them, part of a federal system for the United\r\nKingdom. If the first steps were being taken to construct a federal\r\nsystem, there was no precedent for coercing Ulster to form part of a\r\nfederal unit which she refused to join. He had been Solicitor-General\r\nwhen the Act establishing the Commonwealth of Australia was being\r\ndiscussed, and it never would have passed, he declared, \"if every single\r\nclause had not been agreed to by every single one of the communities\r\nconcerned.\" Ministers were always basing their Irish policy on Dominion\r\nanalogies, but could anyone, Carson asked, imagine the Imperial\r\nGovernment sending troops to compel the Transvaal or New South Wales to\r\ncome into a federal system against their will?\r\n\r\nThe arguments in favour of the amendment were also stated with\r\nuncompromising force by Mr. William Moore, Mr. Charles Craig, and his\r\nbrother Captain James Craig, the last-mentioned taking up a challenge\r\nthrown down by Mr. Birrell in a maladroit speech which had expressed\r\ndoubt as to the reality of the danger to be apprehended in Ulster.\r\nCaptain Craig said they would immediately take steps in Ulster to\r\nconvince the Chief Secretary of their sincerity. Lord Hugh Cecil, in an\r\noutspoken speech, greatly to the taste of English Unionists, \"had no\r\nhesitation in saying that Ulster would be perfectly right in resisting,\r\nand he hoped she would be successful.\"\r\n\r\nIn the division on Mr. Agar-Robartes's amendment the Government\r\nmajority fell to sixty-nine, both the \"Tellers\" being usual supporters\r\nof the Ministry. Mr. F.E. Smith, in a vigorous speech to the Belfast\r\nOrangemen on the 12th of July, declared that \"on the part of the\r\nGovernment the discussion (on Mr. Agar-Robartes's amendment) was a trap.\r\n... The Government hoped that Ulster would decline the amendment in\r\norder that the Coalition might protest to the constituencies: 'We\r\noffered Ulster exclusion and Ulster refused exclusion--where is the\r\ngrievance of Ulster? where her justification for armed revolt?'\" The\r\nsnare was avoided; but the debate was a landmark in the movement, for it\r\nwas then that the spokesmen of Ulster for the first time publicly\r\naccepted the idea of separate treatment for themselves as a possible\r\nalternative policy to the integral maintenance of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Government, for their part, made no response to the demand of Bonar\r\nLaw and Carson that they should declare their intentions for dealing\r\nwith resistance in Ulster. It was clearly more than ever necessary for\r\nthe Ulstermen to \"trust in themselves.\" The debates on the Bill occupied\r\nParliament till the end of the year, and beyond it, and great blocks of\r\nclauses were carried under the guillotine closure without a word of\r\ndiscussion, although they were packed with constitutional points, many\r\nof which were of the highest moment. Over in Ulster, at the same time,\r\nthose preparations were industriously carried forward which Captain\r\nCraig told the House of Commons would be necessary to cure the\r\nscepticism of the Chief Secretary.\r\n\r\nIn England and Scotland, also, Unionists did their utmost to make public\r\nopinion realise the gravity of the crisis towards which the country was\r\ndrifting under the Wait-and-See Ministry. Never before, probably, had so\r\nmany great political meetings been held in any year as were held in\r\nevery part of the country in 1912. With the exception of those that took\r\nplace in Ireland, the most striking was a monster gathering at Blenheim\r\non the 27th of July, which was attended by delegates from every Unionist\r\nAssociation in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nA notable defeat of the Government in a by-election at Crewe, news of\r\nwhich reached the meeting while the audience of some fifteen thousand\r\npeople was assembling, was an encouraging sign of the trend of opinion\r\nin the country, and added confidence to the note of defiance that\r\nsounded in the speeches of Mr. Bonar Law, Mr. F.E. Smith, and Sir Edward\r\nCarson.\r\n\r\nThe Unionist leader repeated, with added emphasis, what he had already\r\nsaid in the House of Commons, that he could imagine no length of\r\nresistance to which Ulster might go in which he and the overwhelming\r\nmajority of the British people would not be ready to give support. He\r\nagain said that resistance would be justified only because the people\r\nhad not been consulted, and the Government's policy was \"part of a\r\ncorrupt parliamentary bargain.\" He refused to acknowledge the right of\r\nthe Government \"to carry such a Revolution by such means,\" and as they\r\nappeared to be resolved to do so, Mr. Bonar Law and the party he led\r\n\"would use any means to deprive them of the power they had usurped, and\r\nto compel them to face the people they had deceived.\" Mr. F.E. Smith\r\nexpressed the same thought in a more epigrammatic antithesis: \"We have\r\ncome to a clear issue between the party which says 'We will judge for\r\nthe democracy,' and the party which says 'The democracy shall judge\r\nyou.'\"\r\n\r\nThe tremendous enthusiasm evoked by Mr. Bonar Law's pledge of support to\r\nUlster, and by Sir Edward Carson's announcement that they in Ulster\r\n\"would shortly challenge the Government to interfere with them if they\r\ndared, and would with equanimity await the result,\" was a sufficient\r\nproof, if proof were needed, that the intention of the Ulstermen to\r\noffer forcible resistance to Home Rule had the whole-hearted sympathy\r\nand approval of the entire Unionist party in Great Britain, whose\r\nrepresentatives from every corner of the country were assembled at\r\nBlenheim.\r\n\r\nLiberals hoped and believed that this promise of support for the\r\n\"rebellious\" attitude of Ulster would alienate British opinion from the\r\nUnionist party. The supporters of the Government in the Press daily\r\nproclaimed that it was doing so. When Parliament adjourned for the\r\nsummer recess, at the beginning of what journalists call \"the silly\r\nseason,\" Mr. Churchill published two letters to a constituent in\r\nScotland which were intended to be a crushing indictment both of Ulster\r\nand of her sympathisers in Great Britain. The Ulster menace was in his\r\neyes nothing but \"melodramatic stuff,\" and he sneeringly suggested that\r\nthe Unionist leaders would be \"unspeakably shocked and frightened\" if\r\nanything came of their \"foolish and wicked words.\" The letter was\r\nlengthy, and contained some telling phrases such as Mr. Churchill has\r\nalways been skilful in coining; but the \"turgid homily--a mixture of\r\nsophistry, insult, and menace,\" as _The Times_ not unfairly described\r\nit, was less effective than the terse and simple rejoinder in which Mr.\r\nBonar Law pointed out that Mr. Churchill's onslaught wounded his\r\nfather's memory more deeply than it touched his living opponents, since\r\nLord Randolph's \"incitement\" of Ulster was at a time when Ulster could\r\nnot be cast out from the Union without the consent of the British\r\nelectors.\r\n\r\nMr. Churchill's epistles to Scottish Liberals started a correspondence\r\nwhich reverberated through the Press for weeks, breaking the monotony of\r\nthe holiday season; but they entirely failed in their purpose, which was\r\nto break the sympathy for Ulster in England and Scotland. In March the\r\nUnionists had won a seat at a by-election in South Manchester; the\r\nvictory at Crewe in July, which so cheered the gathering at Blenheim,\r\nwas followed by still more striking victories in North-west Manchester\r\nin August, and in Midlothian--Gladstone's old constituency--in\r\nSeptember; and perhaps a not less significant indication of the trend of\r\nopinion so far as the Unionist party was concerned, was given by the\r\nlocal Unionist Association at Rochdale, which promptly repudiated its\r\nselected candidate who had ventured to protest against the Blenheim\r\nspeech of the Unionist leader. In an analysis of electoral statistics\r\npublished by _The Times_ on the 24th of August it was shown that, in\r\nthirty-eight contests since the General Election in December 1910, the\r\nUnionists had gained an advantage of more than 32,000 votes over\r\nLiberals. And shortly afterwards, at a dinner in London to three newly\r\nelected Unionists, Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that the results of\r\nby-elections, if realised in the same proportion all over the country,\r\nwould have given a substantial Unionist majority in the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nThe Ulster people had, therefore, much to encourage them at a time when\r\nthey were preparing the most significant forward step in the movement,\r\nand the most solemn pronouncement of their unfaltering resolution never\r\nto submit to the Dublin Parliament--the signing of the Ulster Covenant.\r\nTheir policy of resistance, first propounded at Craigavon, reiterated at\r\nBalmoral, endorsed by British sympathisers at Blenheim, and specifically\r\ndefended in Parliament both by Unionist leaders like Mr. Bonar Law and\r\nMr. Long and by prominent members of the Unionist rank and file like\r\nLord Hugh Cecil, had won the approval and support of great popular\r\nconstituencies in Lancashire and in Scotland, and had alienated no\r\nsection of Unionist opinion or of the Unionist Press. It was in no\r\nmerely satirical spirit that Carson wrote in August that he was grateful\r\nto Mr. Churchill \"for having twice within a few weeks done something to\r\nfocus public opinion on the stern realities of the situation in\r\nUlster.\"[27] For that was the actual result of the \"turgid homily.\" It\r\nproved of real service to the Ulster cause by bringing to light the\r\ncomplete solidarity of Unionist opinion in its support. That meant, in\r\nthe light of the electoral returns, that certainly more than half the\r\nnation sympathised with the measures that were being taken in Ulster,\r\nand that Ulster could well afford to smile at the mockery which English\r\nHome Rulers deemed a sufficient weapon to demolish the \"wooden guns\" and\r\nthe \"military play-acting of King Carson's Army.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] See _The Times_, August 19th, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE EVE OF THE COVENANT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was one Liberal statesman, formerly the favourite lieutenant of\r\nGladstone and the closest political ally of Asquith, who was under no\r\nillusion as to the character of the men with whom Asquith was now\r\nprovoking a conflict. Speaking in Edinburgh on the 1st of November,\r\n1911, that is, shortly after the Craigavon meeting, Lord Rosebery told\r\nhis Scottish audience that \"he loved Highlanders and he loved\r\nLowlanders, but when he came to the branch of their race which had been\r\ngrafted on to the Ulster stem he took off his hat with reverence and\r\nawe. They were without exception the toughest, the most dominant, the\r\nmost irresistible race that existed in the universe.\"[28]\r\n\r\nThe kinship of this tough people with the Lowlanders of Scotland, in\r\ncharacter as in blood, was never more signally demonstrated than when\r\nthey decided, in one of the most intense crises of their history, to\r\nemulate the example of their Scottish forefathers in binding themselves\r\ntogether by a solemn League and Covenant to resist what they deemed to\r\nbe a tyrannical encroachment on their liberties and rights.\r\n\r\nThe most impressive moment at the Balmoral meeting at Easter 1912 was\r\nwhen the vast assemblage, with uncovered heads, raised their hands and\r\nrepeated after Sir Edward Carson words abjuring Home Rule. The incident\r\nsuggested to some of the local Unionist leaders that the spirit of\r\nenthusiastic solidarity and determination thus manifested should not be\r\nallowed to evaporate, and the people so animated to disperse to the four\r\ncorners of Ulster without any bond of mutual obligation. The idea of an\r\noath of fidelity to the cause and to each other was mooted, and\r\nappeared to be favoured by many. The leader was consulted. He gave deep,\r\nanxious, and prolonged consideration to the proposal, calculating all\r\nthe consequences which, in various possible eventualities, might follow\r\nits adoption. He was not only profoundly conscious of the moral\r\nresponsibility which he personally, and his colleagues, would be\r\nundertaking by the contemplated measure; he realised the numerous\r\npractical difficulties there might be in honouring the bond, and he\r\nwould have nothing to do with a device which, under the guise of a\r\nsolemn covenant, would be nothing more than a verbal manifesto. If the\r\npeople were to be invited to sign anything of the sort, it must be a\r\nreality, and he, as leader, must first see his way to make it a reality,\r\nwhatever might happen.\r\n\r\nFor, although Carson never shrank from responsibility, he never assumed\r\nit with levity, or without full consideration of all that it might\r\ninvolve. Many a time, especially before he had fully tested for himself\r\nthe temper of the Ulster people, he expressed to his intimates his\r\nwonder whether the bulk of his followers sufficiently appreciated the\r\nseriousness of the course they had set out upon. Sometimes in private he\r\nseemed to be hypersensitive as to whether in any particular he was\r\nmisleading those who trusted him; he was scrupulously anxious that they\r\nshould not be carried away by unreflecting enthusiasm, or by personal\r\ndevotion to himself. About the only criticism of his leadership that was\r\never made directly to himself by one of the rank and file in Ulster was\r\nthat it erred on the side of patience and caution; and this criticism\r\nelicited the sharpest reproof he was ever heard to administer to any of\r\nhis followers.[29] His expressions of regard, almost amounting to\r\naffection, for the men and women who thronged round him for a touch of\r\nhis hand wherever he appeared in the streets might have been ignorantly\r\nset down as the arts of a demagogue had they ever been spoken in public,\r\nbut were capable of no such misconstruction when reserved, as they\r\ninvariably were, for the ears of his closest associates. The truth is\r\nthat no popular leader was ever less of a demagogue than Sir Edward\r\nCarson. He had no \"arts\" at all--unless indeed complete simplicity is\r\nthe highest of all \"arts\" in one whom great masses of men implicitly\r\ntrust. He never sought to gain or augment the confidence of his\r\nfollowers by concealing facts, minimising difficulties, or overcolouring\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, then, that the decision to invite the Ulster\r\npeople to bind themselves together by some form of written bond or oath\r\nwas one which Carson did not come to hastily. While the matter was still\r\nonly being talked about by a few intimate friends, and had not been in\r\nany way formally proposed, Captain James Craig happened to be occupying\r\nhimself one day at the Constitutional Club in London with pencil and\r\npaper, making experimental drafts that might do for the proposed\r\npurpose, when he was joined by Mr. B.W.D. Montgomery, Secretary of the\r\nUlster Club in Belfast, who asked what he was doing. \"Trying to draft an\r\noath for our people at home,\" replied Craig, \"and it's no easy matter to\r\nget at what will suit.\" \"You couldn't do better,\" said Montgomery, \"than\r\ntake the old Scotch Covenant. It is a fine old document, full of grand\r\nphrases, and thoroughly characteristic of the Ulster tone of mind at\r\nthis day.\" Thereupon the two men went to the library, where, with the\r\nhelp of the club librarian, they found a History of Scotland containing\r\nthe full text of the celebrated bond of the Covenanters (first drawn up,\r\nby a curious coincidence of names, by John Craig, in 1581), a verbatim\r\ncopy of which was made from the book.\r\n\r\nThe first idea was to adapt this famous manifesto of militant\r\nProtestantism by making only such abbreviations and alterations as would\r\nrender it suitable for the purpose in view. But when it was ultimately\r\ndecided to go forward with the proposal, and the task of preparing the\r\ndocument was entrusted to the Special Commission,[30] it was at once\r\nrealised that, however strongly the fine old Jacobean language and the\r\nhistorical associations of the Solemn League and Covenant might appeal\r\nto the imagination of a few, it was far too involved and long-winded,\r\nno matter how drastically revised, to serve as an actual working\r\nagreement between men of to-day, or as a rallying-point for a modern\r\ndemocratic community. What was needed was something quite short and\r\neasily intelligible, setting forth in as few words as possible a purpose\r\nwhich the least learned could grasp at a glance, and which all who so\r\ndesired could sign with full comprehension of what they were doing.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Sinclair, one of the Special Commission, was himself a\r\ndraughtsman of exceptional skill, and in a matter of this kind his\r\nadvice was always invaluable, and it was under his hand that the Ulster\r\nCovenant, after frequent amendment, took what was, with one important\r\nexception, its final shape. The last revision cut down the draft by more\r\nthan one-half; but the portion discarded from the Covenant itself, in\r\nthe interest of brevity, was retained as a Resolution of the Ulster\r\nUnionist Council which accompanied the Covenant and served as a sort of\r\ndeclaratory preamble to it[31]. The exception referred to was an\r\namendment made to meet an objection raised by prominent representatives\r\nof the Presbyterian Church. The Special Commission, realising that the\r\nproposed Covenant ought not to be promulgated without the consent and\r\napproval of the Protestant Churches, submitted the agreed draft to the\r\nauthorities of the Church of Ireland and of the Presbyterian, Methodist,\r\nand Congregational Churches. The Moderator, and other leaders of the\r\nPresbyterians, including Mr. (afterwards Sir Alexander) McDowell, a man\r\nendowed with much of the wisdom of the serpent, while supporting without\r\ndemur the policy of the Covenant, took exception to its terms in a\r\nsingle particular. They pointed out that the obligation to be accepted\r\nby the signatories would be, as the text then stood, of unlimited\r\nduration. They objected to undertaking such a responsibility without the\r\npossibility of modifying it to meet the changes which time and\r\ncircumstance might bring about; and they insisted that, before they\r\ncould advise their congregations to contract so solemn an engagement,\r\nthe text of the Covenant must be amended by the introduction of words\r\nlimiting its validity to the crisis which then confronted them.\r\n\r\nThis was accordingly done. Words were introduced which declared the\r\npledge to be binding \"throughout this our time of threatened calamity,\"\r\nand its purpose to be the defeat of \"the present conspiracy.\" The\r\nlanguage was as precise, and was as carefully chosen, as the language of\r\na legal deed; but in an unhappy crisis which arose in 1916, in\r\ncircumstances which no one in the world could have foreseen in 1912,\r\nthere were some in Ulster who were not only tempted to strain the\r\ninterpretation which the Covenant as a whole could legitimately bear,\r\nbut who failed to appreciate the significance of the amendments that had\r\nbeen made in its text at the instance of the Presbyterian Church.[32]\r\n\r\nWhen these amendments had been incorporated in the Covenant by the\r\nSpecial Commission, a meeting of the Standing Committee was convened at\r\nCraigavon on the 19th of September to adopt it for recommendation to the\r\nCouncil. The Committee, standing in a group outside the door leading\r\nfrom the arcade at Craigavon to the tennis-lawn, listened while Sir\r\nEdward Carson read the Covenant aloud from a stone step which now bears\r\nan inscription recording the event. Those present showed by their\r\ndemeanour that they realised the historic character of the transaction\r\nin which they were taking part, and the weight of responsibility they\r\nwere about to assume. But no voice expressed dissent or hesitation. The\r\nCovenant was adopted unanimously and without amendment. Its terms were\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     \"ULSTER'S SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT\r\n\r\n     \"Being convinced in our consciences that Home Rule would be\r\n     disastrous to the material well-being of Ulster as well as of the\r\n     whole of Ireland, subversive of our civil and religious freedom,\r\n     destructive of our citizenship, and perilous to the unity of the\r\n     Empire, we, whose names are underwritten, men of Ulster, loyal\r\n     subjects of His Gracious Majesty King George V, humbly relying on\r\n     the God whom our fathers in days of stress and trial confidently\r\n     trusted, do hereby pledge ourselves in solemn Covenant throughout\r\n     this our time of threatened calamity to stand by one another in\r\n     defending for ourselves and our children our cherished position of\r\n     equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means\r\n     which may be found necessary to defeat the present conspiracy to\r\n     set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland. And in the event of such\r\n     a Parliament being forced upon us we further solemnly and mutually\r\n     pledge ourselves to refuse to recognise its authority. In sure\r\n     confidence that God will defend the right we hereto subscribe our\r\n     names. And further, we individually declare that we have not\r\n     already signed this Covenant. God save the King.\"\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 23rd of September, the Ulster Unionist Council, the body\r\nrepresenting the whole loyalist community on an elective and thoroughly\r\ndemocratic basis, held its annual meeting in the Ulster Hall, the chief\r\nbusiness being the ratification of the Covenant prior to its being\r\npresented for general signature throughout the province on Ulster Day.\r\nUpwards of five hundred delegates attended the meeting, and unanimously\r\napproved the terms of the document recommended for their acceptance by\r\ntheir Standing Committee. They then adopted, on the motion of Lord\r\nLondonderry, the Resolution which, as already mentioned, had originally\r\nformed part of the draft of the Covenant itself. This Resolution, as\r\nwell as the Covenant, was the subject of extensive comment in the\r\nEnglish and Scottish Press. Some opponents of Ulster directed against it\r\nthe flippant ridicule which appeared to be their only weapon against a\r\nmovement the gravity of which was admitted by Ministers of the Crown;\r\nbut, on the whole, the British Press acknowledged the important\r\nenunciation of political principle which it contained. It placed on\r\nrecord that:\r\n\r\n     \"Inasmuch as we, the duly elected delegates and members of the\r\n     Ulster Unionist Council, representing all parts of Ulster, are\r\n     firmly persuaded that by no law can the right to govern those whom\r\n     we represent be bartered away without their consent; that although\r\n     the present Government, the services and sacrifices of our race\r\n     having been forgotten, may drive us forth from a Constitution which\r\n     we have ever loyally upheld, they may not deliver us bound into the\r\n     hands of our enemies; and that it is incompetent for any authority,\r\n     party, or people to appoint as our rulers a Government dominated by\r\n     men disloyal to the Empire and to whom our faith and traditions are\r\n     hateful; and inasmuch as we reverently believe that, as in times\r\n     past it was given our fathers to save themselves from a like\r\n     calamity, so now it may be ordered that our deliverance shall be by\r\n     our own hands, to which end it is needful that we be knit together\r\n     as one man, each strengthening the other, and none holding back or\r\n     counting the cost--therefore we, Loyalists of Ulster, ratify and\r\n     confirm the steps so far taken by the Special Commission this day\r\n     submitted and explained to us, and we reappoint the Commission to\r\n     carry on its work on our behalf as in the past.\r\n\r\n     \"We enter into the Solemn Covenant appended hereto, and, knowing\r\n     the greatness of the issues depending on our faithfulness, we\r\n     promise each to the others that, to the uttermost of the strength\r\n     and means given us, and not regarding any selfish or private\r\n     interest, our substance or our lives, we will make good the said\r\n     Covenant; and we now bind ourselves in the steadfast determination\r\n     that, whatever may befall, no such domination shall be thrust upon\r\n     us, and in the hope that by the blessing of God our Union with\r\n     Great Britain, upon which are fixed our affections and trust, may\r\n     yet be maintained, and that for ourselves and for our children, for\r\n     this Province and for the whole of Ireland, peace, prosperity, and\r\n     civil and religious liberty may be secured under the Parliament of\r\n     the United Kingdom and of the King whose faithful subjects we are\r\n     and will continue all our days.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been known for some weeks that it was the intention of the Ulster\r\nLoyalists to dedicate the 28th of September as \"Ulster Day,\" by holding\r\nspecial religious services, after which they were to \"pledge themselves\r\nto a solemn Covenant,\" the terms of which were not yet published or,\r\nindeed, finally settled. This announcement, which appeared in the Press\r\non the 17th of August, was hailed in England as an effective reply to\r\nthe recent \"turgid homily\" of Mr. Churchill, but there was really no\r\nconnection between them in the intentions of Ulstermen, who had been too\r\nmuch occupied with their own affairs to pay much attention to the attack\r\nupon them in the Dundee letters. The Ulster Day celebration was to be\r\npreceded by a series of demonstrations in many of the chief centres of\r\nUlster, at which the purpose of the Covenant was to be explained to the\r\npeople by the leader and his colleagues, and a number of English Peers\r\nand Members of Parliament arranged to show their sympathy with the\r\npolicy embodied in the Covenant by taking part in the meetings.\r\n\r\nIt would not be true to say that the enthusiasm displayed at this great\r\nseries of meetings in September eclipsed all that had gone before, for\r\nit would not be possible for human beings greatly to exceed in that\r\nemotion what had been seen at Craigavon and Balmoral; but they exhibited\r\nan equally grave sense of responsibility, and they proved that the same\r\nexaltation of mind, the same determined spirit, that had been displayed\r\nby Loyalists collected in the populous capital of their province,\r\nequally animated the country towns and rural districts.\r\n\r\nThe campaign opened at Enniskillen on the 18th of September, where the\r\nleader was escorted by two squadrons of mounted and well-equipped yeomen\r\nfrom the station to Portora Gate, at which point 40,000 members of\r\nUnionist Clubs drawn from the surrounding agricultural districts marched\r\npast him in military order. During the following nine days\r\ndemonstrations were held at Lisburn, Derry, Coleraine, Ballymena,\r\nDromore, Portadown, Crumlin, Newtownards, and Ballyroney, culminating\r\nwith a meeting in the Ulster Hall--loyalist headquarters--on the eve of\r\nthe signing of the Covenant on Ulster Day. At six of these meetings,\r\nincluding, of course, the last, Sir Edward Carson was the principal\r\nspeaker, while all the Ulster Unionist Members of Parliament took part\r\nin their several constituencies. Lord Londonderry was naturally\r\nprominent among the speakers, and presided as usual, when the Duke of\r\nAbercorn was prevented by illness from being present, in the Ulster\r\nHall. Mr. F.E. Smith, who had closely identified himself with the\r\nUlster Movement, delighting with his fresh and vigorous eloquence the\r\nmeetings at Balmoral and Blenheim, as well as the Orange Lodges whom he\r\nhad addressed on the 12th of July, crossed the Channel to lend a helping\r\nhand, and spoke at five meetings on the tour. Others who took part--in\r\naddition to local men like Mr. Thomas Sinclair and Mr. John Young, whose\r\nhigh character always made their appearance on political platforms of\r\nvalue to the cause they supported--were Lord Charles Beresford, Lord\r\nSalisbury, Mr. James Campbell, Lord Hugh Cecil, Lord Willoughby de\r\nBroke, and Mr. Harold Smith; while the Marquis of Hamilton and Lord\r\nCastlereagh, by the part which they took in the programme, showed their\r\ndesire to carry on the traditions which identified the two leading\r\nUlster families with loyalist principles.\r\n\r\nA single resolution, identical in the simplicity of its terms, was\r\ncarried without a dissenting voice at every one of these meetings: \"We\r\nhereby reaffirm the resolve of the great Ulster Convention of 1892: 'We\r\nwill not have Home Rule.'\" These words became so familiar that the\r\nlaconic phrase \"We won't have it,\" was on everybody's lips as the Alpha\r\nand Omega of Ulster's attitude, and was sometimes heard with unexpected\r\nabruptness in no very precise context. A ticket-collector, when clipping\r\nthe tickets of the party who were starting from Belfast in a saloon for\r\nEnniskillen, made no remark and no sign of recognition till he reached\r\nCarson, when he said almost in a whisper and without a glimmer of a\r\nsmile, as he took a clip out of the leader's ticket: \"Tell the\r\nstation-master at Clones, Sir Edward, that we won't have it.\" He\r\ndoubtless knew that the political views of that misguided official were\r\nof the wrong colour. A conversation overheard in the crowd at\r\nEnniskillen before the speaking began was a curious example of the habit\r\nso characteristic of Ulster--and indeed of other parts of Ireland\r\nalso--of thinking of\r\n\r\n    \"Old, unhappy, far-off things, and battles long ago\"\r\n\r\nas if they had occurred last week, and were a factor to be taken into\r\naccount in the conduct of to-day. The demonstration was in the open air,\r\nand the sunshine was gleaming on the grass of a hill close at hand. \"It\r\n'ud be a quare thing,\" said a peasant to his neighbour in the crowd, \"if\r\nthe rebels would come out and hould a meetin' agin us on yon hill.\"\r\n\"What matter if they would,\" was the reply, \"wouldn't we let on that we\r\nwon't have it? an' if that wouldn't do them, isn't there hundreds o'\r\nKing James's men at the bottom o' the lough, an' there's plenty o' room\r\nyet.\" It was not spoken in jest, but in grim conviction that the issue\r\nof 1689 was the issue of 1912, and that another Newtown Butler might\r\nhave to be fought.\r\n\r\nThis series of meetings in preparation for the Covenant brought Carson\r\nmuch more closely in touch with the Loyalists in outlying districts than\r\nhe had been hitherto, and when it was over their wild devotion to him\r\npersonally equalled what it was in Belfast itself. The appeal made to\r\nthe hearts of men as quick as any living to detect and resent humbug or\r\nboastfulness, by the simplicity, uncompromising directness, and courage\r\nof his character was irresistible. He never spoke better than during\r\nthis tour of the Province. The Special Correspondent of _The Times_, who\r\nsent to his paper vivid descriptive articles on each meeting, said in\r\nhis account of the meeting at Coleraine that \"Sir Edward Carson was\r\nvigorous, fresh, and picturesque. His command over the feelings of his\r\nUlster audiences is unquestionable, and never a phrase passes his lips\r\nwhich does not tell.\" And when the proceedings of the meeting were over,\r\nthe same observer \"was at the station to witness the 'send-off' of the\r\nleaders, and for ten minutes before the train for Belfast came in the\r\ntumult of the cheers, the thanks, and the farewells never faltered for\r\nan instant.\"[33] Two days later another English commentator declared\r\nthat \"The Ulster campaign has been conducted up to the present with a\r\ncombination of wisdom, ability, and restraint which has delighted all\r\nthe Unionists of the province, and exasperated their Radical and\r\nNationalist enemies. From its opening at Enniskillen not a speech has\r\nbeen delivered unworthy of a great movement in defence of civil and\r\nreligious liberty.\"[34]\r\n\r\nIt was characteristic of Sir Edward Carson that neither at these\r\nmeetings nor at any time did he use his unmatched power of persuasion to\r\ninduce his followers to come forward and sign the Covenant. On the\r\ncontrary, he rather warned them only to do so after mature reflection\r\nand with full comprehension of the responsibility which signature would\r\nentail. He told the Unionist Council a few days before the memorable\r\n28th of September: \"How often have I thought over this Covenant--how\r\nmany hours have I spent, before it was published that we would have one,\r\nin counting the cost that may result! How many times have I thought of\r\nwhat it may mean to all that we care about up here! Does any man believe\r\nthat I lightly took this matter in hand without considering with my\r\ncolleagues all that it may mean either in the distant or the not too\r\ndistant future? No, it is the gravest matter in all the grave matters in\r\nthe various offices I have held that I have ever had to consider.\" And\r\nhe went on to advise the delegates, \"responsible men from every district\r\nin Ulster, that it is your duty, when you go back to your various\r\ndistricts, to warn your people who trust you that, in entering into this\r\nsolemn obligation, they are entering into a matter which, whatever may\r\nhappen in the future, is the most serious matter that has ever\r\nconfronted them in the course of their lives.\"[35]\r\n\r\nA political campaign such as that of September 1912 could not be a\r\nsuccess, however spontaneous the enthusiasm of the people, however\r\neffective the oratory, unless the arrangements were based on good\r\norganisation. It was by general consent a triumph of organisation, the\r\ncredit for which was very largely due to Mr. Richard Dawson Bates, the\r\nSecretary of the Ulster Unionist Council. Sir Edward Carson himself very\r\nwisely paid little attention to detail; happily there was no need for\r\nhim to do so, for he had beside him in Captain James Craig and Mr. Bates\r\ntwo men with real genius for organisation, and indefatigable in\r\nrelieving \"the chief\" of all unnecessary work and worry. Mr. Bates had\r\nall the threads of a complex network of organisation in his hands; he\r\nkept in close touch with leading Unionists in every district; he always\r\nknew what was going on in out-of-the-way corners, and where to turn for\r\nthe right man for any particular piece of work. Anyone whose duty it has\r\nbeen to manage even a single political demonstration on a large scale\r\nknows what numerous details have to be carefully foreseen and provided\r\nfor. In Ulster a succession of both outdoor and indoor demonstrations,\r\nseldom if ever equalled in this country in magnitude and complexity of\r\narrangement, besides an amazing quantity of other miscellaneous work\r\ninseparable from the conduct of a political movement in which crisis\r\nfollowed crisis with bewildering rapidity, were managed year after year\r\nfrom Mr. Bates's office in the Old Town Hall with a quiet,\r\nunostentatious efficiency which only those could appreciate who saw the\r\nmachine at work and knew the master mechanic behind it. Of this\r\nefficiency the September demonstrations in 1912 were a conspicuous\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nNor did the Loyalist women of Ulster lag an inch behind the men either\r\nin organisation or in zeal for the Unionist cause, and their keenness at\r\nevery town visited in this September tour was exuberantly displayed.\r\nWomen had not yet been enfranchised, of course, and the Ulster women had\r\nshown but little interest in the suffragette agitation which was raging\r\nat this time in England; but they had organised themselves in defence of\r\nthe Union very effectively on parallel lines to the men, and if the\r\nlatter had needed any stimulus to their enthusiasm they would certainly\r\nhave got it from their mothers, sisters, and wives. The Marchioness of\r\nLondonderry threw herself whole-heartedly into the movement. Having\r\nalways ably seconded her husband's many political and social activities,\r\nshe made no exception in regard to his devotion to Ulster. Lord\r\nLondonderry, she was fond of saying, was an Ulsterman born and bred, and\r\nshe was an Ulsterwoman \"by adoption and grace.\" Her energy was\r\ninexhaustible, and her enthusiasm contagious; she used her influence and\r\nher wonderful social gifts unsparingly in the Unionist cause.\r\n\r\nA meeting of the Ulster Women's Unionist Council, of which the Dowager\r\nMarchioness of Dufferin and Ava, widow of the great diplomat, was\r\npresident, was held on the 17th of September, the day before the\r\ndemonstration at Enniskillen, when a resolution proposed by Lady\r\nLondonderry declaring the determination of Ulster women to stand by\r\ntheir men in the policy to be embodied in the Covenant, was carried with\r\nimmense enthusiasm and without dissent. No women were so vehement in\r\ntheir support of the Loyalist cause as the factory workers, who were\r\nvery numerous in Belfast. Indeed, their zeal, and their manner of\r\ndisplaying it, seemed sometimes to illustrate a well-known line of\r\nKipling's, considered by some to be anything but complimentary to the\r\nfemale sex. Anyhow, there was no divergence of opinion or sympathy\r\nbetween the two sexes in Ulster on the question of Union or Home Rule;\r\nand the women who everywhere attended the meetings in large numbers were\r\nno idle sightseers--though they were certainly hero-worshippers of the\r\nUlster leader--but a genuine political force to be taken into account.\r\n\r\nIt was during the September campaign that the \"wooden guns\" and \"dummy\r\nrifles\" appeared, which excited so much derision in the English Radical\r\nPress, whose editors little dreamed that the day was not far distant\r\nwhen Mr. Asquith's Government would be glad enough to borrow those same\r\ndummy rifles for training the new levies of Kitchener's Army to fight\r\nthe Germans. So far as the Ulstermen were concerned the ridicule of\r\ntheir quasi-military display and equipment never had any sting in it.\r\nThey were conscious of the strength given to their cause by the\r\ndiscipline and military organisation of the volunteers, even if the\r\nweapons with which they drilled should never be replaced by the real\r\nthing; and many of them had an instinctive belief that their leaders\r\nwould see to it that they were effectively armed all in good time. And\r\nso with grim earnestness they recruited the various battalions of\r\nvolunteers, gave up their evenings to drilling, provided cyclist corps,\r\nsignalling corps, ambulances and nurses; they were proud to receive\r\ntheir leader with guards of honour at the station, and bodyguards while\r\nhe drove through their town or district to the meetings where he spoke.\r\nFew of them probably ever so much as heard of the gibes of _The Irish\r\nNews_, _The Daily News_, or _The Westminster Gazette_ at the \"royal\r\nprogresses\" of \"King Carson\"; but they would have been in no way upset\r\nby them if they had, for they were far too much in earnest themselves to\r\npay heed to the cheap sneers of others. At each one of the September\r\nmeetings there was a military setting to the business of the day. At\r\nEnniskillen Carson was conducted by a cavalry escort to the ground where\r\nhe was to address the people; at Coleraine, Portadown, and other places\r\nvolunteers lined the route and marched in column to and from the\r\nmeeting. They were, it is true, but \"half-baked\" levies, with more zeal\r\nthan knowledge of military duties. But competent critics--and there were\r\nmany such amongst the visitors--praised their bearing and physique and\r\nthe creditable measure of discipline they had already acquired. And it\r\nmust be remembered that in September 1912 the Ulster Volunteer Force was\r\nstill in its infancy. In the following two years its improvement in\r\nefficiency was very marked; and within three years of the time when its\r\nbattalions paraded before Sir Edward Carson, with dummy rifles, and\r\nmarched before him to his meetings in Lisburn, Newtownards, Enniskillen,\r\nand Belfast on the eve of the Covenant, those same men had gloriously\r\nfought against the flower of the Prussian Army, and many of them had\r\nfallen in the battle of the Somme.\r\n\r\nThe final meeting in the Ulster Hall on Friday the 27th of September was\r\nan impressive climax to the tour. Many English journalists and other\r\nvisitors were present, and some of them admitted that, in spite of all\r\nthey had heard of what an Ulster Hall meeting was like, they were\r\nastonished by the soul-stirring fervour they witnessed, and especially\r\nby the wonderful spectacle presented at the overflow meeting in the\r\nstreet outside, which was packed as far as the eye could reach in either\r\ndirection with upturned faces, eager to catch the words addressed to\r\nthem from a platform erected for the speakers outside an upper window of\r\nthe building.[36]\r\n\r\nMessages of sympathy and approval at this supreme moment were read from\r\nMr. Bonar Law and Lord Lansdowne, Mr. Long, Mr. Balfour, and Mr. Austen\r\nChamberlain. Then, after brief speeches by four local Belfast men, one\r\nof whom was a representative of Labour, and while the audience were\r\nwaiting eagerly for the speech of their leader, there occurred what _The\r\nTimes_ next day described as \"two entirely delightful, and, as far as\r\nthe crowd was concerned, two entirely unexpected episodes.\" The first\r\nwas the presentation to Sir Edward Carson of a faded yellow silk banner\r\nby Colonel Wallace, Grand Master of the Belfast Orangemen, who explained\r\nthat it was the identical banner that had been carried before King\r\nWilliam III at the battle of the Boyne, and was now lent by its owner, a\r\nlineal descendant of the original standard-bearer, to be carried before\r\nCarson to the signing of the Covenant; the second was the presentation\r\nto the leader of a silver key, symbolic of Ulster as \"the key of the\r\nsituation,\" and a silver pen wherewith to sign the Covenant on the\r\nmorrow, by Captain James Craig. \"The two incidents,\" continued the\r\nCorrespondent of _The Times_, \"were followed by the audience with\r\nbreathless excitement, and made a remarkably effective prelude to Sir\r\nEdward Carson's speech. Premeditated, no doubt, that incident of the\r\nbanner--yet entirely graceful, entirely fitting to the spirit of the\r\noccasion--a plan carried through with the sense of ceremony which\r\nUlstermen seem to have always at their command in moments of emotion.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if ever there was a \"moment of emotion\" for the Loyalists of\r\nUlster--those descendants of the Plantation men who had been\r\ndeliberately sent to Ireland with a commission from the first sovereign\r\nof a united Britain to uphold British interests, British honour, and the\r\nReformed Faith across the narrow sea--Loyalists who were conscious that\r\nthroughout the generations they had honestly striven to be faithful to\r\ntheir mission--if ever in their long and stormy history they experienced\r\na \"moment of emotion,\" it was assuredly on this evening before the\r\nsigning of their Covenant.\r\n\r\nThe speeches delivered by their leader and others were merely a vent for\r\nthat emotion. There was nothing that could be said about their cause\r\nthat they did not know already; but all felt that the heart of the\r\nmatter was touched--the whole situation, so far as they were concerned,\r\nsummed up in a single sentence of Carson's speech: \"We will take\r\ndeliberately a step forward, not in defiance but in defence; and the\r\nCovenant which we will most willingly sign to-morrow will be a great\r\nstep forward, in no spirit of aggression, in no spirit of ascendancy,\r\nbut with a full knowledge that, if necessary, you and I--you trusting\r\nme, and I trusting you--will follow out everything that this Covenant\r\nmeans to the very end, whatever the consequences.\" Every man and woman\r\nwho heard these words was filled with an exalted sense of the solemnity\r\nof the occasion. The mental atmosphere was not that of a political\r\nmeeting, but of a religious service--and, in fact, the proceedings had\r\nbeen opened by prayer, as had become the invariable custom on such\r\noccasions in Ulster. It was felt to be a time of individual preparation\r\nfor the _Sacramentum_ of the following day, which Protestant Ulster had\r\nset apart as a day of self-dedication to a cause for which they were\r\nwilling to make any sacrifice.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28] _The Scotsman_, November 2nd, 1911.\r\n\r\n[29] See Sir B.

So far as the\r\nProtestants of all denominations were concerned, Ulster was a province\r\nat prayer on that memorable Saturday morning. In Belfast, not only the\r\nservices which had more or less of an official character--those held in\r\nthe Cathedral, in the Ulster Hall, in the Assembly Hall--but those held\r\nin nearly all the places of worship in the city, were crowded with\r\nreverent worshippers. It was the same throughout the country towns and\r\nrural districts--there was hardly a village or hamlet where the parish\r\nchurch and the Presbyterian and Methodist meeting-houses were not\r\nattended by congregations of unwonted numbers and fervour. Not that\r\nthere was any of the religious excitement such as accompanies revivalist\r\nmeetings; it was simply that a population, naturally religious-minded,\r\nturned instinctively to divine worship as the fitting expression of\r\ncommon emotion at a moment of critical gravity in their history. \"One\r\nnoteworthy feature,\" commented upon by one of the English newspaper\r\ncorrespondents in a despatch telegraphed during the day, \"is the silence\r\nof the great shipyards. In these vast industrial establishments on both\r\nsides of the river, 25,000 men were at work yesterday performing their\r\ntask at the highest possible pressure, for the order-books of both firms\r\nare full of orders. Now there is not the sound of a hammer; all is as\r\nsilent as the grave. The splendid craftsmen who build the largest ships\r\nin the world have donned their Sunday clothes, and, with Unionist\r\nbuttons on the lapels of their coats, or Orange sashes on their\r\nshoulders, are about to engage on what to them is an even more important\r\ntask.\" He also noticed that although the streets were crowded there was\r\nno excitement, for \"the average Ulsterman performs his religious and\r\npolitical duties with calm sobriety. He has no time to-day for mirth or\r\nmerriment, for every minute is devoted to proving that he is still the\r\nsame man--devoted to the Empire, to the King, and Constitution.\"[37]\r\n\r\nThere is at all times in Ulster far less sectarian enmity between the\r\nEpiscopal and other Reformed Churches than in England; on Ulster Day the\r\ncomplete harmony and co-operation between them was a marked feature of\r\nthe observances. At the Cathedral in Belfast the preacher was the Bishop\r\nof Down,[38] while a Presbyterian minister representing the Moderator of\r\nthe General Assembly, and the President of the Methodist College took\r\npart in the conduct of the service. At the Ulster Hall the same unity\r\nwas evidenced by a similar co-operation between clergy of the three\r\ndenominations, and also at the Assembly Hall (a Presbyterian place of\r\nworship), where Dr. Montgomery, the Moderator, was assisted by a\r\nclergyman of the Church of Ireland representing the Bishop.\r\n\r\nThe service in the Ulster Hall was attended by Sir Edward Carson, the\r\nLord Mayor of Belfast (Mr. McMordie, M.P.), most of the distinguished\r\nvisitors from England, and by those Ulster members whose constituencies\r\nwere in or near the city; those representing country seats went thither\r\nto attend local services and to sign the Covenant with their own\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nOne small but significant detail in the day's proceedings was much\r\nnoticed as a striking indication of the instinctive realisation by the\r\ncrowd of the exceptional character of the occasion. Bedford Street,\r\nwhere the Ulster Hall is, was densely packed with spectators, but when\r\nthe leader arrived, instead of the hurricane of cheers that invariably\r\ngreeted his appearance in the streets, there was nothing but a general\r\nuncovering of heads and respectful silence. It is true that the people\r\nabundantly compensated themselves for this moment of self-restraint\r\nlater on, until in the evening one wondered how human throats could\r\nsurvive so many hours of continuous strain; but the contrast only made\r\nthe more remarkable that almost startling silence before the religious\r\nservice began.\r\n\r\nThe \"sense of ceremony\" which _The Times_ Correspondent on another\r\noccasion had declared to be characteristic of Ulstermen \"in moments of\r\nemotion,\" was certainly displayed conspicuously on Ulster Day. Ceremony\r\nat large public functions is naturally cast in a military\r\nmould--marching men, bands of music, display of flags, guards of honour,\r\nand so forth--and although on this occasion there was, it is true, more\r\nthan mere decorative significance in the military frame to the picture,\r\nit was an admirably designed and effective spectacle. It is but a few\r\nhundred yards from the Ulster Hall to the City Hall, where the signing\r\nof the Covenant was to take place. When the religious service ended,\r\nabout noon, Sir Edward Carson and his colleagues proceeded from one hall\r\nto the other on foot. The Boyne standard, which had been presented to\r\nthe leader the previous evening, was borne before him to the City Hall.\r\nHe was escorted by a guard consisting of a hundred men from the Orange\r\nLodges of Belfast and a like number representing the Unionist clubs of\r\nthe city. These clubs had also provided a force of 2,500 men, whose\r\nduty, admirably performed throughout the day, was to protect the gardens\r\nand statuary surrounding the City Hall from injury by the crowd, and to\r\nkeep a clear way to the Hall for the endless stream of men entering to\r\nsign the Covenant.\r\n\r\nThe City Hall in Belfast is a building of which Ulster is justly proud.\r\nIt is, indeed, one of the few modern public buildings in the British\r\nIslands in which the most exacting critic of architecture finds nothing\r\nto condemn. Standing in the central site of the city with ample garden\r\nspace in front, its noble proportions and beautiful façade and dome fill\r\nthe view from the broad thoroughfare of Donegal Place. The main entrance\r\nhall, leading to a fine marble stairway, is circular in shape,\r\nsurrounded by a marble colonnade carrying the dome, to which the hall is\r\nopen through the full height of the building. It was in this central\r\nspace beneath the dome that a round table covered with the Union Jack\r\nwas placed for the signing of the Covenant by the Ulster leaders and the\r\nmost prominent of their supporters.\r\n\r\nTo those Englishmen who have never been able to grasp the Ulster point\r\nof view, and who have, therefore, persisted in regarding the Ulster\r\nMovement as a phase of party politics in the ordinary sense, it must\r\nappear strange and even improper that the City Hall, the official\r\nquarters of the Corporation, should have been put to the use for which\r\nit was lent on Ulster Day, 1912. The vast majority of the citizens,\r\nwhose property it was, thought it could be used for no better purpose\r\nthan to witness their signatures to a deed securing to them their\r\nbirthright in the British Empire.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the City Hall Sir Edward Carson was received by the\r\nLord Mayor and members of the Corporation wearing their robes of office,\r\nand by the Harbour Commissioners, the Water Board, and the Poor Law\r\nGuardians, by whom he was accompanied into the hall. The text of\r\nUlster's Solemn League and Covenant had been printed on sheets with\r\nplaces for ten signatures on each; the first sheet lay on the table for\r\nEdward Carson to sign.\r\n\r\nNo man but a dullard without a spark of imagination could have witnessed\r\nthe scene presented at that moment without experiencing a thrill which\r\nhe would have found it difficult to describe. The sunshine, sending a\r\nbeam through the stained glass of the great window on the stairway,\r\nthrew warm tints of colour on the marbles of the columns and the\r\ntesselated floor of the hall, sparkled on the Lord Mayor's chain, lent a\r\nrich glow to the scarlet gowns of the City Fathers, and lit up the red\r\nand the blue and the white of the Imperial flag which draped the table\r\nand which was the symbol of so much that they revered to those who stood\r\nlooking on. They were grouped in a semicircle behind the leader as he\r\nstepped forward to sign his name--men of substance, leaders in the\r\ncommercial life of a great industrial city, elderly men many of them,\r\nlovers of peace and order; men of mark who had served the Crown, like\r\nLondonderry and Campbell and Beresford; Doctors of Divinity, guides and\r\nteachers of religion, like the Bishop and the Moderator of the General\r\nAssembly; Privy Councillors; members of the Imperial Parliament;\r\nbarristers and solicitors, shopkeepers and merchants,--there they all\r\nstood, silent witnesses of what all felt to be one of the deeds that\r\nmake history, assembled to set their hands, each in his turn, to an\r\nInstrument which, for good or evil, would influence the destiny of their\r\nrace; while behind them through the open door could be seen a vast\r\nforest of human heads, endless as far as eye could reach, every one of\r\nwhom was in eager accord with the work in hand, and whose blended\r\nvoices, while they waited to perform their own part in the great\r\ntransaction, were carried to the ears of those in the hall like the\r\ninarticulate noise of moving waters.\r\n\r\nWhen Carson had signed the Covenant he handed the silver pen to\r\nLondonderry, and the latter's name was followed in order by the\r\nsignatures of the Moderator of the General Assembly, the Lord Bishop of\r\nDown, Connor, and Dromore (afterwards Primate of All Ireland), the Dean\r\nof Belfast (afterwards Bishop of Down), the General Secretary of the\r\nPresbyterian Church, the President of the Methodist Conference, the\r\nex-Chairman of the Congregational Union, Viscount Castlereagh, and Mr.\r\nJames Chambers, M.P. for South Belfast; and the rest of the company,\r\nincluding the Right Hon. Thomas Sinclair and the veteran Sir William\r\nEwart, as well as the members of the Corporation and other public\r\nauthorities and boards, having attached their signatures to other\r\nsheets, the general public waiting outside were then admitted.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for signature by the general public had fully taxed the\r\norganising ability of the specially appointed Ulster Day Committee, and\r\ntheir three hon. secretaries, Mr. Dawson Bates, Mr. McCammon, and Mr.\r\nFrank Hall. They made provision for signatures to be received in many\r\nhundreds of localities throughout Ulster, but it was impossible to\r\nestimate closely the numbers that would require accommodation at the\r\nCity Hall. Lines of desks, giving a total desk-space of more than a\r\nthird of a mile, were placed along both sides of the corridors on the\r\nupper and lower floors of the building, which enabled 540 persons to\r\nsign the Covenant simultaneously. It all worked wonderfully smoothly,\r\nlargely because every individual in the multitude outside was anxious to\r\nhelp in maintaining orderly procedure, and behaved with the greatest\r\npatience and willingness to follow directions. The people were admitted\r\nto the Hall in batches of 400 or 500 at a time, and as there was no\r\nconfusion there was no waste of time. All through the afternoon and up\r\nto 11 p.m., when the Hall was closed, there was an unceasing flow of men\r\neager to become Covenanters. Immense numbers who belonged to the Orange\r\nLodges, Unionist clubs, or other organised bodies, marched to the Hall\r\nin procession, and those whose route lay through Royal Avenue had an\r\nopportunity, of which they took the fullest advantage, of cheering\r\nCarson, who watched the memorable scene from the balcony of the Reform\r\nClub, the quondam headquarters of Ulster Liberalism.\r\n\r\nProminent and influential men in the country districts refrained from\r\ncoming to Belfast, preferring to sign the Covenant with their neighbours\r\nin their own localities. The Duke of Abercorn, who had been prevented by\r\nfailing health from taking an active part in the movement of late, and\r\nwhose life unhappily was drawing to a close, signed the Covenant at\r\nBarons Court; his son, the Marquis of Hamilton, M.P. for Derry, attached\r\nhis signature in the Maiden City together with the Bishop; another\r\nprelate, the Bishop of Clogher, signed at Enniskillen with the Grand\r\nMaster of the Orangemen, Lord Erne; at Armagh, the Primate of All\r\nIreland, the Dean, and Sir John Lonsdale, M.P. (afterwards Lord\r\nArmaghdale), headed the list of signatures; the Provost of Trinity\r\nCollege signed in Dublin; and at Ballymena the veteran Presbyterian\r\nPrivy Councillor, Mr. John Young, and his son Mr. William Robert Young,\r\nHon. Secretary of the Ulster Unionist Council, and for thirty years one\r\nof the most zealous and active workers for the Loyalist cause, were the\r\nfirst to sign. But a more notable Covenanter than any of these local\r\nleaders was Lord Macnaghten, one of the most illustrious of English\r\nJudges, whose great position as Lord of Appeal did not deter him from\r\nwholly identifying himself with his native Ulster, by accepting the full\r\nresponsibility of the signatories of the Covenant.\r\n\r\nUlstermen living in other parts of Ireland, and in Great Britain, were\r\nnot forgotten. Arrangements were made enabling such to sign the Covenant\r\nin Dublin, London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol,\r\nand York. Two curious details may be added, which no reader who is alive\r\nto the picturesqueness of historical associations will deem too trivial\r\nto be worth recording. In Edinburgh a number of Ulstermen signed the\r\nCovenant in the old Greyfriars' Churchyard on the \"Covenanters' Stone,\"\r\nthe well-known memorial of the Scottish Covenant of the seventeenth\r\ncentury; and the other incident was that, among some twenty men who\r\nsigned the Covenant in Belfast with their own blood, Major Crawford was\r\nable to claim that he was following a family tradition, inasmuch as a\r\nlineal ancestor had in the same grim fashion emphasised his adherence to\r\nthe Solemn League and Covenant in 1638.\r\n\r\nThe most careful precautions were taken to ensure that all who signed\r\nwere properly entitled to do so, by requiring evidence to be furnished\r\nof their Ulster birth or domicile, and references able to corroborate\r\nit. The declaration in the Covenant itself that the person signing had\r\nnot already done so was in order to make sure that none of the\r\nsignatures should be duplicates. When the lists were closed--they were\r\nkept open for some days after Ulster Day--they were very carefully\r\nscrutinised by a competent staff at the Old Town Hall, and it is certain\r\nthat the numbers as eventually published included no duplicate signature\r\nand none that was not genuine. Precisely the same care was taken in the\r\ncase of the Declaration by which, in words similar to the Covenant but\r\nwithout its pledge for definite action, the women of Ulster associated\r\nthemselves with the men \"in their uncompromising opposition to the Home\r\nRule Bill now before Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 22nd of November that the scrutiny and verification\r\nof the signatures was completed, and the actual numbers published. They\r\nwere as follows: In Ulster itself 218,206 men had registered themselves\r\nas Covenanters, and 228,991 women had signed the Declaration; in the\r\nrest of Ireland and in Great Britain 19,162 men and 5,055 women had\r\nsigned. Thus, a grand total of 471,414 Ulster men and women gave their\r\nadherence to the policy of which the Ulster Covenant was the solemn\r\npledge. To every one of these was given a copy of the document printed\r\non parchment, to be retained as a memento, and in thousands of cottages\r\nthroughout Ulster the framed Covenant hangs to-day in an honoured place,\r\nand is the householder's most treasured possession.\r\n\r\nAlthough the main business of the day was over, so far as Carson and the\r\nother leaders were concerned, when they had signed the Covenant in the\r\nCity Hall at noon, every hour, and every minute in the hour, until they\r\ntook their departure in the Liverpool packet in the evening, was full of\r\nincident and excitement. The multitude in the streets leading to the\r\nCity Hall was so densely packed that they had great difficulty in making\r\ntheir way to the Reform Club, where they were to be entertained at\r\nlunch. And, as every man and woman in the crowd was desperately anxious\r\nthe moment they saw him to get near enough to Carson to shake him by the\r\nhand, the pressure of the swaying mass of humanity was a positive\r\ndanger. Happily the behaviour of the people was as exemplary as it was\r\ntumultuously enthusiastic. _The Times_ Special Correspondent thus summed\r\nup his impressions of the scene:\r\n\r\n     \"Belfast did all that a city could do for such an occasion. I do\r\n     not well see how its behaviour could have been more impressive. The\r\n     tirelessness of the crowd--it was that perhaps which struck me\r\n     most; and, secondly, the good conduct of the crowd. Belfast had one\r\n     of the lowest of its Saturday records for drunkenness and\r\n     disorderliness yesterday. I was in the Reform Club between one and\r\n     three o'clock. Again and again I went out on the balcony and\r\n     watched the streets. I saw the procession of thousands upon\r\n     thousands come down Royal Avenue. But this was not the only line of\r\n     march, for all Belfast was now converging upon the City Hall, the\r\n     arrangements in which must have been elaborate. It was a procession\r\n     a description of which would have been familiar to the Belfast\r\n     public, but the like of which is only seen in Ulster.\"\r\n\r\nThe tribute here paid to the conduct of the Belfast crowd was well\r\nmerited. But in this respect the day of the Covenant was not so\r\nexceptional as it would have been before the beginning of the Ulster\r\nMovement. Before that period neither Belfast nor any part of Ulster\r\ncould have been truthfully described as remarkable for its sobriety. But\r\nby the universal testimony of those qualified to judge in such\r\nmatters--police, clergy of all denominations, and workers for social\r\nwelfare--the political movement had a sobering and steadying influence\r\non the people, which became more and more noticeable as the movement\r\ndeveloped, and especially as the volunteers grew in numbers and\r\ndiscipline. The \"man in the street\" gained a sense of responsibility\r\nfrom the feeling that he formed one of a great company whom it was his\r\nwish not to discredit, and he found occupation for mind and body which\r\ndiminished the temptations of idle hours.\r\n\r\nFrom the Reform Club Carson, Londonderry, Beresford, and F.E. Smith went\r\nto the Ulster Club, just across the street, where they dined as the\r\nguests of Lord Mayor McMordie before leaving for Liverpool; and it was\r\noutside that dingy building that the enthusiasm of the people reached a\r\nclimax. None who witnessed it can ever forget the scene, which the\r\nEnglish newspaper correspondents required all their superlatives to\r\ndescribe for London readers next day. Those superlatives need not be\r\nserved up again here. One or two bald facts will perhaps give to anyone\r\npossessing any faculty of visualisation as clear an idea as they could\r\nget from any number of dithyrambic pages. The distance from the Ulster\r\nClub to the quay where the Liverpool steamer is berthed is ordinarily\r\nless than a ten minutes' walk. The wagonette in which the Ulster leader\r\nand his friends were drawn by human muscles took three minutes short of\r\nan hour to traverse it. It was estimated that into that short space of\r\nstreet some 70,000 to 100,000 people had managed to jam themselves.\r\nMovement was almost out of the question, yet everyone within reach\r\ntried to press near enough to grasp hands with the occupants of the\r\ncarriage. When at last the shed was reached the people could not bear to\r\nlet Carson disappear through the gates. _The Times_ Correspondent heard\r\nthem shout, \"Don't leave us,\" \"You mustn't leave us,\" and, he added, \"It\r\nwas seriously meant; it was only when someone pointed out that Sir\r\nEdward Carson had work to do in England for Ulster, that the crowd\r\nfinally gave way and made an opening for their hero.\"[39] There had been\r\nspeeches from the balcony of the Reform Club in the afternoon; speeches\r\nfrom the window of the Ulster Club in the evening; speeches outside the\r\ndock gates; speeches from the deck of the steamer before departure;\r\nspeeches by Carson, by Londonderry, by F.E. Smith, by Lord Charles\r\nBeresford--and the purport of one and all of them could be summed up in\r\nthe familiar phrase, \"We won't have it.\" But this simple theme,\r\nelaborated through all the modulations of varied oratory, was one of\r\nwhich the Belfast populace was no more capable of becoming weary than is\r\nthe music lover of tiring of a recurrent _leitmotif_ in a Wagner opera.\r\n\r\nAt last the ship moved off, and speech was no longer possible. It was\r\nreplaced by song, \"Rule Britannia\"; then, as the space to the shore\r\nwidened, \"Auld Lang Syne\"; and finally, when the figures lining the quay\r\nwere growing invisible in the darkness, those on board heard thousands\r\nof Loyalists fervently singing \"God save the King.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] _The Standard_, September 30th, 1912.\r\n\r\n[38] Dr. D'Arcy, now (1922) Primate of All Ireland.\r\n\r\n[39] _The Times_, September 30th, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPASSING THE BILL\r\n\r\nNo part of Great Britain displayed a more constant and whole-hearted\r\nsympathy with the attitude of Ulster than the city of Liverpool. There\r\nwas much in common between Belfast and the great commercial port on the\r\nMersey. Both were the home of a robust Protestantism, which perhaps was\r\nreinforced by the presence in both of a quarter where Irish Nationalists\r\npredominated. Just as West Belfast gave a seat in Parliament to the most\r\nforceful of the younger Nationalist generation, Mr. Devlin, the Scotland\r\nDivision of Liverpool had for a generation been represented by Mr. T.P.\r\nO'Connor, one of the veteran leaders of the Parnellite period. In each\r\ncase the whole of the rest of the city was uncompromisingly\r\nConservative, and among the members for Liverpool at the time was Mr.\r\nF.E. Smith, unquestionably the most brilliant of the rising generation\r\nof Conservatives, who had already conspicuously identified himself with\r\nthe Ulster Movement, and was a close friend as well as a political\r\nadherent of Carson. Among local leaders of opinion in Liverpool Alderman\r\nSalvidge exercised a wide and powerful influence on the Unionist side.\r\n\r\nIt was in accordance with the fitness of things, therefore, that\r\nLiverpool should have wished to associate itself in no doubtful manner\r\nwith the men who had just subscribed to the Covenant on the other side\r\nof the Channel. Having left Belfast amid the wonderful scenes described\r\nin the last chapter, Carson, Londonderry, F.E. Smith, Beresford, and the\r\nrest of the distinguished visitors awoke next morning--if the rollers of\r\nthe Irish Sea permitted sleep--in the oily waters of the Mersey, to find\r\nat the landing-stage a crowd that in dimensions and demeanour seemed to\r\nbe a duplicate of the one they had left outside the dock gates at\r\nBelfast. Except that the point round which everything had centred in\r\nBelfast, the signing of the Covenant, was of course missing in\r\nLiverpool, the Unionists of Liverpool were not to be outdone by the\r\nUlstermen themselves in their demonstration of loyalty to the Union.\r\n\r\nThe packet that carried the group of leaders across the Channel happened\r\nto be, appropriately enough, the R.M.S. _Patriotic_. As she steamed\r\nslowly up the river towards Prince's Landing-stage in the chilly\r\natmosphere of early morning it was at once evident that more than the\r\nmembers of the deputation who had arranged to present addresses to\r\nCarson were out to welcome him to Liverpool, and when the workers who\r\nthronged the river bank started singing \"O God, our help in ages past,\"\r\nthe sound was strangely familiar in ears fresh from Ulster.\r\n\r\nAn address from the Unionist working men of Liverpool and district,\r\npresented by Alderman Salvidge, thanked Carson for his \"magnificent\r\nefforts to preserve the integrity of the Empire,\" and assured him that\r\nthey, \"Unionist workers of the port which is connected with Belfast in\r\nso many ways, stand by Ulster in this great struggle.\" Scenes of intense\r\nenthusiasm in the streets culminated in a monster demonstration in Shiel\r\nPark, at which it was estimated that close on 200,000 people were\r\npresent. In all the speeches delivered and the resolutions adopted\r\nduring this memorable Liverpool visit the same note was sounded, of full\r\napproval of the Covenanters and of determination to support them\r\nwhatever might befall.\r\n\r\nThe events of the last three months, and especially the signing of the\r\nCovenant, had concentrated on Ulster the attention of the whole United\r\nKingdom, not to speak of America and the British oversea Dominions. This\r\nwas not of unmixed advantage to the cause for which Ulster was making so\r\ndetermined a stand. There was a tendency more and more to regard the\r\nopposition to Irish Home Rule as an Ulster question, and nothing else.\r\nThe Unionist protagonists of the earlier, the Gladstonian, period of the\r\nstruggle, men like Salisbury, Randolph Churchill, Devonshire,\r\nChamberlain, and Goschen, had treated it mainly as an Imperial question,\r\nwhich it certainly was. In their eyes the Irish Loyalists, of whom the\r\nUlstermen were the most important merely because they happened to be\r\ngeographically concentrated, were valuable allies in a contest vital to\r\nthe safety and prosperity of the British Empire; but, although the\r\nparticular interests of these Loyalists were recognised as possessing a\r\npowerful claim on British sympathy and support, this was a consideration\r\nquite secondary in comparison with the larger aspects of Imperial policy\r\nraised by the demand for Home Rule. It was an unfortunate result of the\r\nprominence into which Ulster was forced after the introduction of Mr.\r\nAsquith's measure that these larger aspects gradually dropped away, and\r\nthe defence of the Union came to be identified almost completely in\r\nEngland and Scotland with support of the Ulster Loyalists. It was to\r\nthis aspect of the case that Mr. Kipling gave prominence in the poem\r\npublished on the day of the Balmoral meeting,[40] although no one was\r\nless prone than he to magnify a \"side-show\" in Imperial policy; and it\r\nwas the same note that again was sounded on the eve of the Covenant by\r\nanother distinguished English poet. The general feeling of bewilderment\r\nand indignation that the only part of Ireland which had consistently\r\nupheld the British connection should now be not only thrown over by the\r\nBritish Government but denounced for its obstinate refusal to co-operate\r\nin a separatist movement, was finely expressed in Mr. William Watson's\r\nchallenging poem, \"Ulster's Reward,\" which appeared in _The Times_ a few\r\ndays before the signing of the Covenant in Belfast:\r\n\r\n    \"What is the wage the faithful earn?\r\n    What is a recompense fair and meet?\r\n    Trample their fealty under your feet--\r\n    That, is a fitting and just return.\r\n      Flout them, buffet them, over them ride,\r\n      Fling them aside!\r\n\r\n    \"Ulster is ours to mock and spurn,\r\n    Ours to spit upon, ours to deride.\r\n    And let it be known and blazoned wide\r\n    That this is the wage the faithful earn:\r\n      Did she uphold us when others defied?\r\n    Then fling her aside.\r\n\r\n    \"Where on the Earth was the like of it done\r\n    In the gaze of the sun?\r\n    She had pleaded and prayed to be counted still\r\n    As one of our household through good and ill,\r\n      And with scorn they replied;\r\n    Jeered at her loyalty, trod on her pride,\r\n      Spurned her, repulsed her,\r\n      Great-hearted Ulster;\r\n    Flung her aside.\"\r\n\r\nAppreciating to the full the sympathy and support which their cause\r\nreceived from leading men of letters in England, it was not the fault of\r\nthe Ulstermen themselves that the larger Imperial aspects of the\r\nquestion thus dropped into the background. They continually strove to\r\nmake Englishmen realise that far more was involved than loyal support of\r\nEngland's only friends in Ireland; they quoted such pronouncements as\r\nAdmiral Mahan's that \"it is impossible for a military man, or a\r\nstatesman with appreciation of military conditions, to look at a map and\r\nnot perceive that if the ambition of the Irish Separatists were\r\nrealised, it would be even more threatening to the national life of\r\nBritain than the secession of the South was to that of the American\r\nRepublic.... An independent Parliament could not safely be trusted even\r\nto avowed friends\"; and they showed over and over again, quoting chapter\r\nand verse from Nationalist utterances, and appealing to acknowledged\r\nfacts in recent and contemporary history, that it was not to \"avowed\r\nfriends,\" but to avowed enemies, that Mr. Asquith was prepared to\r\nconcede an independent Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut those were the days before the rude awakening from the dream that\r\nthe world was to repose for ever in the soft wrappings of universal\r\npeace. Questions of national defence bored Englishmen. The judgment of\r\nthe greatest strategical authority of the age weighed less than one of\r\nLord Haldane's verbose platitudes, and the urgent warnings of Lord\r\nRoberts less than the impudent snub administered to him by an\r\nUnder-Secretary. Speakers on public platforms found that sympathy with\r\nUlster carried a more potent appeal to their audience than any other\r\nthey could make on the Irish question, and they naturally therefore\r\nconcentrated attention upon it. Liberals, excited alternately to fury\r\nand to ridicule by the proceedings in Belfast, heaped denunciation on\r\nCarson and the Covenant, thereby impelling their opponents to vehement\r\ndefence of both; and the result of all this was that before the end of\r\n1912 the sun of Imperial policy which had drawn the homage of earlier\r\ndefenders of the Union was almost totally eclipsed by the moon of\r\nUlster.\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament reassembled for the autumn session in October the Prime\r\nMinister immediately moved a \"guillotine\" resolution for allotting time\r\nfor the remaining stages of the Home Rule Bill, and, in resisting this\r\nmotion, Mr. Bonar Law made one of the most convincing of his many\r\nconvincing speeches against the whole policy of the Bill. It stands for\r\nall time as the complete demonstration of a proposition which he argued\r\nover and over again--that Home Rule had never been submitted to the\r\nBritish electorate, and that that fact alone was full justification for\r\nUlster's resolve to resist it. It was impossible for any democratic\r\nMinister to refute the contention that even if the principle of the\r\nGovernment's policy had been as frankly submitted to the electorate as\r\nit had in fact been carefully withheld, it would still remain true that\r\nthe intensity of the Ulster opposition was itself a new factor in the\r\nsituation upon Which the people were entitled to be consulted. There was\r\na limit, said Mr. Bonar Law, to the obligation to submit to legally\r\nconstituted authority, and that limit was reached \"in a free country\r\nwhen a body of men, whether they call themselves a Cabinet or not,\r\npropose to make a great change like this for which they have never\r\nreceived the sanction of the people.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, however, thoroughly understood by every member of the House of\r\nCommons that argument, no matter how irrefutable, had no effect on the\r\nsituation, which was governed by the simple fact that the life of the\r\nMinistry depended on the good-will of the Nationalist section of the\r\nCoalition, which rigorously demanded the passage of the Bill in the\r\ncurrent session, and feared nothing so much as the judgment of the\r\nEnglish people upon it. Consequently, under the guillotine, great blocks\r\nof the Bill, containing the most far-reaching constitutional issues,\r\nand matters vital to the political and economic structure of the centre\r\nof the British Empire, were passed through the House of Commons by the\r\nringing of the division bells without a word of discussion, exactly as\r\nthey had come from the pen of the official draftsman, and destined under\r\nthe exigencies of the Parliament Act procedure to be forced through the\r\nLegislature in the same raw condition in the two following sessions.\r\n\r\nThis last-mentioned fact suggested a consideration which weighed heavily\r\non the minds of the Ulster leaders as the year 1912 drew to a close, and\r\nwith it the debates on the Bill in Committee. Had the time come when\r\nthey ought to put forward in Parliament an alternative policy to the\r\nabsolute rejection of the Bill? They had not yet completely abandoned\r\nhope that Ministers, however reluctantly, might still find it impossible\r\nto stave off an appeal to the country; but the opposite hypothesis was\r\nthe more probable. If the Bill became law in its present form they would\r\nhave to fall back on the policy disclosed at Craigavon and embodied in\r\nthe Covenant. But, although it is true that they had supported Mr.\r\nAgar-Robartes's amendment to exclude certain Ulster counties from the\r\njurisdiction to be set up in Dublin, the Ulster representatives were\r\nreluctant to make proposals of their own which might be misrepresented\r\nas a desire to compromise their hostility to the principle of Home Rule.\r\nUnder the Parliament Act procedure, however, they realised that no\r\nmaterial change would be allowed to be made in the Bill after it first\r\nleft the House of Commons, although two years would have to elapse\r\nbefore it could reach the Statute-book; if they were to propound any\r\nalternative to \"No Home Rule\" it was, therefore, a case of now or never.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the extreme gravity of the course to be followed in\r\nUlster in the event of the measure passing into law, it was decided that\r\nthe most honest and straightforward thing to do was to put forward at\r\nthe juncture now reached a policy for dealing with Ulster separately\r\nfrom the rest of Ireland. But in fulfilment of the promise, from which\r\nhe never deviated, to take no important step without first consulting\r\nhis supporters in Ulster, Carson went over to attend a meeting of the\r\nStanding Committee in Belfast on the 13th of December, where he\r\nexplained fully the reasons why this policy was recommended by himself\r\nand all his parliamentary colleagues. It was not accepted by the\r\nStanding Committee without considerable discussion, but in the end the\r\ndecision was unanimous, and the resolution adopting it laid it down that\r\n\"in taking this course the Standing Committee firmly believes the\r\ninterests of Unionists in the three other provinces of Ireland will be\r\nbest conserved.\" In order to emphasise that the course resolved upon\r\nimplied no compromise of their opposition to the Bill as a whole, Sir\r\nEdward Carson wrote a letter to the Prime Minister during the Christmas\r\nrecess, which was published in the Press, and which made this point\r\nclear; and he pressed it home in the House of Commons on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1913, when he moved to exclude \"the Province of Ulster\" from\r\nthe operation of the Bill in a speech of wonderfully persuasive\r\neloquence which deeply impressed the House, and which was truly\r\ndescribed by Mr. Asquith as \"very powerful and moving,\" and by Mr.\r\nRedmond as \"serious and solemn.\"\r\n\r\nCarson's proposal was altogether different from what was subsequently\r\nenacted in 1920. It was consistent with the uninterrupted demand of\r\nUlster to be let alone, it asked for no special privilege, except the\r\nprivilege, which was also claimed as an inalienable right, to remain a\r\npart of the United Kingdom with full representation at Westminster and\r\nnowhere else; it required the creation of no fresh subordinate\r\nconstitution raising the difficult question as to the precise area which\r\nits jurisdiction could effectively administer.\r\n\r\nCarson's amendment was, of course, rejected by the Government's\r\ninvariably docile majority, and on the 16th of January the Home Rule\r\nBill passed the third reading in the House of Commons, without the\r\nsmallest concession having been made to the Ulster opposition, or the\r\nslightest indication as to how the Government intended to meet the\r\nopposition of a different character which was being organised in the\r\nNorth of Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bill went to the Upper House at the end of January the whole\r\nsubject was threshed out in a series of exceedingly able speeches; but\r\nthe impotence of the Second Chamber under the Parliament Act gave an air\r\nof pathetic unreality to the proceedings, which was neatly epitomised by\r\nLord Londonderry in the sentence: \"The position is, that while the House\r\nof Commons can vote but not speak, the Lords can speak but not vote.\"\r\nNevertheless, such speeches as those of the Archbishop of York, Earl\r\nGrey, the Duke of Devonshire, and Lord Londonderry, were not without\r\neffect on opinion outside. Earl Grey, an admitted authority on federal\r\nconstitutions, urged that if, as the Government were continually\r\nassuring the country, Home Rule was the first step in the federalisation\r\nof the United Kingdom, there was every reason why Ulster should be a\r\ndistinct unit in the federal system. The Archbishop dealt more fully\r\nwith the Ulster question. Admitting that he had formerly believed \"that\r\nthis attitude of Ulster was something of a scarecrow made up out of old\r\nand outworn prejudices,\" he had now to acknowledge that the men of\r\nUlster were \"of all men the least likely to be 'drugged with the wine of\r\nwords,' and were men who of all other men mean and do what they say.\"\r\nBehind all the glowing eloquence of Mr. Asquith and Mr. Redmond, he\r\ndiscerned \"this figure of Ulster, grim, determined, menacing, which no\r\neloquence can exorcise and no live statesmanship can ignore.\" If the\r\nresult of this legislation should be actual bloodshed, then, on\r\nwhomsoever might rest the responsibility for it, it would mean the\r\nshattering of all the hopes of a united and contented Ireland which it\r\nwas the aim of the Bill to create. If Ulster made good her threat of\r\nforcible resistance there was, said the Archbishop, one condition, and\r\none condition only, on which her coercion could be justified, and that\r\nwas that the Government \"should have received from the people of this\r\ncountry an authority clear and explicit\" to carry it out.\r\n\r\nBut among the numerous striking passages in the debate which occupied\r\nthe Peers for four days, none was more telling than Lord Curzon's\r\npicturesque description of how Ulster was to be treated. \"You are\r\ncompelling Ulster,\" he said, \"to divorce her present husband, to whom\r\nshe is not unfaithful, and you compel her to marry someone else whom she\r\ncordially dislikes, with whom she does not want to live; and you do it\r\nbecause she happens to be rich, and because her new partner has a large\r\nand ravenous offspring to provide for. You are asking rather too much of\r\nhuman nature.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Home Rule Bill would be rejected on second reading by the Lords\r\nwas a foregone conclusion, and it was so rejected by a majority of 257\r\non the 31st of January, 1913. The Bill then entered into its period of\r\ngestation under the Parliament Act. The session did not come to an end\r\nuntil the 7th of March, and the new session began three days afterwards.\r\nIt is unnecessary to follow the fortunes of the Bill in Parliament in\r\n1913, for the process was purely mechanical, in order to satisfy the\r\nrequirements of the Parliament Act. The preparations for dealing with\r\nthe mischief it would work went forward with unflagging energy\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] See _ante_, p. 79.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nWAS RESISTANCE JUSTIFIABLE?\r\n\r\n\r\nA story is told of Queen Victoria that in her youthful days, when\r\nstudying constitutional history, she once asked Lord Melbourne whether\r\nunder any circumstances citizens were justified in resisting legal\r\nauthority; to which the old courtier replied: \"When asked that question\r\nby a Sovereign of the House of Hanover I feel bound to answer in the\r\naffirmative.\" If one can imagine a similar question being asked of an\r\nUlsterman by Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George, or Sir Edward Grey, in 1912,\r\nthe reply would surely have been that such a question asked by a\r\nstatesman claiming to be a guardian of Liberal principles and of the\r\nWhig tradition could only be answered in the affirmative. This, at all\r\nevents, was the view of the late Duke of Devonshire, who more than any\r\nother statesman of our time could claim to be a representative in his\r\nown person of the Whig tradition handed down from 1688.[41] Passive\r\nobedience has, indeed, been preached as a political dogma in the course\r\nof English history, but never by apostles of Liberalism. Forcible\r\nresistance to legally constituted authority, even when it involved\r\nrepudiation of existing allegiance, has often, both in our own and in\r\nforeign countries, won the approval and sympathy of English Liberals. A\r\nlong line of illustrious names, from Cromwell and Lord Halifax in\r\nEngland to Kossuth and Mazzini on the Continent, might be quoted in\r\nsupport of such a proposition if anyone were likely to challenge it.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, Liberals professed to be unutterably shocked by Ulster's\r\ndeclared intention to resist Home Rule both actively and passively, they\r\ncould not have based their attitude on the principle that under no\r\ncircumstances could such resistance be morally justified. Indeed, in\r\nthe case in question, there were circumstances that would have made the\r\ncondemnation of Ulster by the English Liberal Party not a little\r\nhypocritical if referred to any general ethical principle. For that\r\nparty had itself been for a generation in the closest political alliance\r\nwith Irishmen whose leader had boasted that they were as much rebels as\r\ntheir fathers were in 1798, and whose power in Ireland had been built up\r\nby long-sustained and systematic defiance of the law. Yet the same\r\npoliticians who had excused, if they had not applauded, the \"Plan of\r\nCampaign,\" and the organised boycotting and cattle-driving which had for\r\nyears characterised the agitation for Home Rule, were unspeakably\r\nshocked when Ulster formed a disciplined Volunteer force which never\r\ncommitted an outrage, and prepared to set up a Provisional Government\r\nrather than be ruled by an assembly of cattle-drivers in Dublin.\r\nMoreover, many of Mr. Asquith's supporters, and one at least of his most\r\ndistinguished colleagues in the Cabinet of 1912, had themselves\r\norganised resistance to an Education Act which they disliked but had\r\nbeen unable to defeat in Parliament.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it must, of course, be freely admitted that the question\r\nas to what conditions justify resistance to the legal authority in the\r\nState--or rebellion, if the more blunt expression be preferred--is an\r\nexceedingly difficult one to answer. It would sound cynical to say,\r\nthough Carlyle hardly shrinks from maintaining, that success, and\r\nsuccess alone, redeems rebellion from wickedness and folly. Yet it would\r\nbe difficult to explain on any other principle why posterity has\r\napplauded the Parliamentarians of 1643 and the Whigs of 1688, while\r\ncondemning Monmouth and Charles Edward; or why Mr. Gladstone sympathised\r\nwith Jefferson Davis when he looked like winning and withdrew that\r\nsympathy when he had lost. But if success is not the test, what is? Is\r\nit the aim of the men who resist? The aim that appears honourable and\r\nheroic to one onlooker appears quite the opposite to another, and so the\r\ntest resolves itself into a matter of personal partisanship.\r\n\r\nThat is probably as near as one can get to a solution of the question.\r\nThose who happen to agree with the purpose for which a rebellion takes\r\nplace think the rebels in the right; those who disagree think them in\r\nthe wrong. As Mr. Winston Churchill succinctly puts it when commenting\r\non the strictures passed on his father for \"inciting\" Ulster to resist\r\nHome Rule, \"Constitutional authorities will measure their censures\r\naccording to their political opinions.\" He reminds us, moreover, that\r\nwhen Lord Randolph was denounced as a \"rebel in the skin of a Tory,\" the\r\nlatter \"was able to cite the authority of Lord Althorp, Sir Robert Peel,\r\nMr. Morley, and the Prime Minister (Gladstone) himself, in support of\r\nthe contention that circumstances might justify morally, if not\r\ntechnically, violent resistance and even civil war.\"[42]\r\n\r\nTo this distinguished catalogue of authorities an Ulster apologist might\r\nhave added the name of the Chief Secretary for Ireland in Mr. Asquith's\r\nown Cabinet, who admitted in 1912 that \"if the religion of the\r\nProtestants were oppressed or their property despoiled they would be\r\nright to fight[43];\" which meant that Mr. Birrell did not condemn\r\nfighting in itself, provided he were allowed to decide when the occasion\r\nfor it had arisen. Greater authorities than Mr. Birrell held that the\r\nUlster case for resistance was a good and valid one as it stood. No\r\nEnglish statesman of the last half-century has deservedly enjoyed a\r\nhigher reputation for political probity, combined with sound common\r\nsense, than the eighth Duke of Devonshire. As long ago as 1893, when\r\nthis same issue had already been raised in circumstances much less\r\nfavourable to Ulster than after the passing of the Parliament Act in\r\n1911, the Duke of Devonshire said:\r\n\r\n     \"The people of Ulster believe, rightly or wrongly, that under a\r\n     Government responsible to an Imperial Parliament they possess at\r\n     present the fullest security which they can possess of their\r\n     personal freedom, their liberties, and their right to transact\r\n     their own business in their own way. You have no right to offer\r\n     them any inferior security to that; and if, after weighing the\r\n     character of the Government which it is sought to impose upon them,\r\n     they resolve that they are no longer bound to obey a law which does\r\n     not give them equal and just protection with their fellow subjects,\r\n     who can say--how at all events can the descendants of those who\r\n     resisted King James II say, that they have not a right, if they\r\n     think fit, to resist, if they think they have the power, the\r\n     imposition of a Government put upon them by force?\"[44]\r\n\r\nAll the same, there never was a community on the face of the earth to\r\nwhom \"rebellion\" in any real sense of the word was more hateful than to\r\nthe people of Ulster. They traditionally were the champions of \"law and\r\norder\" in Ireland; they prided themselves above all things on their\r\n\"loyalty\" to their King and to the British flag. And they never\r\nentertained the idea that the movement which they started at Craigavon\r\nin 1911, and to which they solemnly pledged themselves by their Covenant\r\nin the following year, was in the slightest degree a departure from\r\ntheir cherished \"loyalty\"--on the contrary, it was an emphatic assertion\r\nof it. They held firmly, as Mr. Bonar Law and the whole Unionist party\r\nin Great Britain held also, that Mr. Asquith and his Government were\r\nforcing Home Rule upon them by unconstitutional methods. They did not\r\nbelieve that loyalty in the best sense--loyalty to the Sovereign, to the\r\nEmpire, to the majesty of the law--required of them passive obedience to\r\nan Act of Parliament placed by such means on the Statute-book, which\r\nthey were convinced, moreover, was wholly repugnant to the great\r\nmajority of the British people.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the matter was admirably and soberly presented by _The\r\nTimes_ in one of the many weighty articles in which that great journal\r\ngave undeviating support to the Ulster cause.\r\n\r\n     \"A free community cannot justly, or even constitutionally, be\r\n     deprived of its privileges or its position in the realm by any\r\n     measure that is not stamped with the considered and unquestionable\r\n     approval of the great body of electors of the United Kingdom. Any\r\n     attempt so to deprive them is a fraud upon their fundamental\r\n     rights, which they are justified in resisting, as an act of\r\n     violence, by any means in their power. This is elementary doctrine,\r\n     borne out by the whole course of English history.\"[45]\r\n\r\nThat the position was paradoxical calls for no denial; but the pith of\r\nthe paradox lay in the fact that a movement denounced as \"rebellious\" by\r\nits political opponents was warmly supported not only by large masses,\r\nprobably by the majority, of the people of this country, but by numbers\r\nof individuals of the highest character, occupying stations of great\r\nresponsibility. Whatever may be thought of men engaged in actual\r\npolitical conflict, whom some people appear to think capable of any\r\nwickedness, no one can seriously suggest that men like Lord Macnaghten,\r\nlike the late and present Primates of Ireland, like the late Provost of\r\nTrinity, like many other sober thinkers who supported Ulster, were men\r\nwho would lightly lend themselves to \"rebellion,\" or any other wild and\r\nirresponsible adventure. As _The Times_ very truly observed in a leading\r\narticle in 1912:\r\n\r\n     \"We remember no precedent in our domestic history since the\r\n     Revolution of 1688 for a movement among citizens, law-abiding by\r\n     temperament and habit, which resembles the present movement of the\r\n     Ulster Protestants. It is no rabble who have undertaken it. It is\r\n     the work of orderly, prosperous, and deeply religious men.\"[46]\r\n\r\n\r\nNor did the paradox end there. If the Ulster Movement was \"rebellious,\"\r\nits purpose was as paradoxical as its circumstances. It had in it no\r\nsubversive element. In this respect it stands (so far as the writer's\r\nknowledge goes) without precedent, a solitary instance in the history of\r\nmankind. The world has witnessed rebellions without number, designed to\r\nbring about many different results--to emancipate a people from\r\noppression, to upset an obnoxious form of Government, to expel or to\r\nrestore a rival dynasty, to transfer allegiance from one Sovereign or\r\none State to another. But has there ever been a \"rebellion\" the object\r\nof which was to maintain the _status quo_? Yet that was the sole purpose\r\nof the Ulstermen in all they did from 1911 to 1914. That fact, which\r\ndistinguished their movement from every rebellion or revolution in\r\nhistory, placed them on a far more solid ground of reasonable\r\njustification than the excuse offered by Mr. Churchill for their\r\nbellicose attitude in his father's day. Although he is no doubt right in\r\nsaying that \"When men are sufficiently in earnest they will back their\r\nwords with more than votes,\" it is a plea that would cover alike the\r\nconduct of Halifax and the other Whigs who resisted the legal authority\r\nof James II, of the Jacobites who fought for his grandson, and of the\r\ncontrivers of many another bloody or bloodless Revolution. But there was\r\nnothing revolutionary in the Ulster Movement. It was resistance to the\r\ntransfer of a people's allegiance without their consent; to their\r\nforcible expulsion from a Constitution with which they were content and\r\ntheir forcible inclusion in a Constitution which they detested. This was\r\nthe very antithesis of Revolution. English Radical writers and\r\npoliticians might argue that no \"transfer of allegiance\" was\r\ncontemplated; but Ulstermen thought they knew better, and the later\r\ndevelopment of the Irish question proved how right they were. Even had\r\nthey been proved wrong instead of right in their conviction that the\r\ntrue aim of Irish Nationalism (a term in which Sinn Fein is included)\r\nwas essentially separatist, they knew better than Englishmen how little\r\nreality there was in the theory that under the proposed Home Rule their\r\nallegiance would be unaffected and their political _status_ suffer no\r\ndegradation. They claimed to occupy a position similar to that of the\r\nNorth in the American Civil War--with this difference, which, so far as\r\nit went, told in their favour, that whereas Lincoln took up arms to\r\nresist secession, they were prepared to do so to resist expulsion, the\r\npurpose in both cases, however, being to preserve union. The practical\r\nview of the question, as it would appear in the eyes of ordinary men,\r\nwas well expressed by Lord Curzon in the House of Lords, when he said:\r\n\r\n     \"The people of this country will be very loth to condemn those\r\n     whose only disloyalty it will be to have been excessive in their\r\n     loyalty to the King. Do not suppose that the people of this country\r\n     will call those 'rebels' whose only form of rebellion is to insist\r\n     on remaining under the Imperial Parliament.\"[47]\r\n\r\nOf course, men like Sir Edward Carson, Lord Londonderry, Mr. Thomas\r\nSinclair, and other Ulster leaders were too far-seeing not to realise\r\nthat the course they were taking would expose them to the accusation of\r\nhaving set a bad example which others without the same grounds of\r\njustification might follow in very different circumstances. But this was\r\na risk they had to shoulder, as have all who are not prepared to\r\nsubscribe to the dogma of Passive Obedience without limit. They accepted\r\nit as the less of two evils. But there was something humorous in the\r\npretence put forward in 1916 and afterwards that the violence to which\r\nthe adherents of Sinn Fein had recourse was merely copying Ulster. As if\r\nIrish Nationalism in its extreme form required precedent for\r\ninsurrection! Even the leader of \"Constitutional Nationalism\" himself\r\nhad traced his political pedigree to convicted rebels like Tone and\r\nEmmet, and since the date of those heroes there had been at least two\r\narmed risings in Ireland against the British Crown and Government. If\r\nthe taunt flung at Ulstermen had been that they had at last thrown\r\noverboard law and order and had stolen the Nationalist policy of active\r\nresistance, there would at least have been superficial plausibility in\r\nit. But when it was suggested or implied that the Ulster example was\r\nactually responsible in any degree whatever for violent outbreaks in the\r\nother provinces, a supercilious smile was the only possible retort from\r\nthe lips of representatives of Ulster.\r\n\r\nBut what caused them some perplexity was the disposition manifested in\r\ncertain quarters in England to look upon the two parties in Ireland in\r\nregard to \"rebellion\" as \"six of one and half a dozen of the other.\" It\r\nhas always, unhappily, been characteristic of a certain type of\r\nEnglishman to see no difference between the friends and the enemies of\r\nhis country, and, if he has a preference at all, to give it to the\r\nlatter. Apart from all other circumstances which in the eyes of\r\nUlstermen justified them up to the hilt in the policy they pursued,\r\napart from everything that distinguished them historically and morally\r\nfrom Irish \"rebels,\" there was the patent and all-important fact that\r\nthe motive of their opponents was hostility to England, whereas their\r\nown motive was friendliness and loyalty to England. In that respect they\r\nnever wavered. If the course of events had ever led to the employment of\r\nBritish troops to crush the resistance of Ulster to Home Rule, the\r\nextraordinary spectacle would have been presented to the wondering world\r\nof the King's soldiers shooting down men marching under the British flag\r\nand singing \"God save the King.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no doubt because this was very generally understood in England\r\nthat the sympathies of large masses of law-loving people were never for\r\na moment alienated from the men of Ulster by all the striving of their\r\nenemies to brand them as rebels. Constitutional authorities may, as Mr.\r\nChurchill says, \"measure their censures according to their political\r\nopinions,\" but the generality of men, who are not constitutional\r\nauthorities, whose political opinions, if they have any, are\r\nfluctuating, and who care little for \"juridical niceties,\" will measure\r\ntheir censures according to their instinctive sympathies. And the sound\r\ninstinct of Englishmen forbade them to blame men who, if rebels in law,\r\nwere their firm friends in fact, for taking exceptional and even illegal\r\nmeasures, when all others failed, to preserve the full unity which they\r\nregarded as the fruit of that friendship.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] See _Life of the Eighth Duke of Devonshire,_ by Bernard Holland,\r\nii, pp. 249-51.\r\n\r\n[42] _Life of Lord Randolph Churchill_, vol. ii, p. 65.\r\n\r\n[43] _Annual Register_, 1912, p. 82.\r\n\r\n[44] Bernard Holland's _Life of the Eighth Duke of Devonshire_, ii, 250.\r\n\r\n[45] _The Times_, July 14th, 1913.\r\n\r\n[46] Ibid., August 22nd, 1912.\r\n\r\n[47] _Parliamentary Debates_ (House of Lords), July 15th, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT AND PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the death of the Duke of Abercorn on the 3rd of January, 1913, the\r\nUlster Loyalists lost a leader who had for many years occupied a very\r\nspecial place in their affection and confidence. Owing to failing health\r\nhe had been unable to take an active part in the exciting events of the\r\npast two years, but the messages of encouragement and support which were\r\nread from him at Craigavon, Balmoral, and other meetings for organising\r\nresistance, were always received with an enthusiasm which showed, and\r\nwas intended to show, that the great part he had played in former years,\r\nand especially his inspiring leadership as Chairman of the Ulster\r\nConvention in 1893, had never been forgotten.\r\n\r\nHis death inflicted also, indirectly, another blow which at this\r\nparticular moment was galling to loyalists out of all proportion to its\r\nintrinsic importance. The removal to the House of Lords of the Marquis\r\nof Hamilton, the member for Derry city, created a vacancy which was\r\nfilled at the ensuing by-election by a Liberal Home Ruler. To lose a\r\nseat anywhere in the north-eastern counties at such a critical time in\r\nthe movement was bad enough, but the unfading halo of the historic siege\r\nrested on Derry as on a sanctuary of Protestantism and loyalty, so that\r\nthe capture of the \"Maiden City\" by the enemy wounded loyalist sentiment\r\nfar more deeply than the loss of any other constituency. The two parties\r\nhad been for some time very nearly evenly balanced there, and every\r\nelectioneering art and device, including that of bringing to the poll\r\nvoters who had long rested in the cemetery, was practised in Derry with\r\nunfailing zeal and zest by party managers. For some time past trade,\r\nespecially ship-building, had been in a state of depression in Derry,\r\nwith the result that a good many of the better class of artisans, who\r\nwere uniformly Unionist, had gone to Belfast and elsewhere to find work,\r\nleaving the political fortunes of the city at the mercy of the casual\r\nlabourer who drifted in from the wilds of Donegal, and who at this\r\nelection managed to place the Home Rule candidate in a majority of\r\nfifty-seven.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of course that the late Duke's place as President of the\r\nUlster Unionist Council should be taken by Lord Londonderry, and it\r\nhappened that the annual meeting at which he was formally elected was\r\nheld on the same day that witnessed the rejection of the Home Rule Bill\r\nby the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nIt was also at this annual meeting (31st January, 1913) that the special\r\nCommission who had been charged to prepare a scheme for the Provisional\r\nGovernment, presented their draft Report. The work had been done with\r\ngreat thoroughness and was adopted without substantial alteration by the\r\nCouncil, but was not made public for several months. The Council itself\r\nwas, in the event of the Provisional Government being set up, to\r\nconstitute a \"Central Authority,\" and provision was made, with complete\r\nelaboration of detail, for carrying on all the necessary departments of\r\nadministration by different Committees and Boards, whose respective\r\nfunctions were clearly defined. Among those who consented to serve in\r\nthese departmental Committees, in addition to the recognised local\r\nleaders in the Ulster Movement, were Dr. Crozier, Archbishop of Armagh,\r\nthe Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in\r\nIreland, Lord Charles Beresford, Major-General Montgomery, Colonel\r\nThomas Hickman, M.P., Lord Claud Hamilton, M.P., Sir Robert Kennedy,\r\nK.C.M.G., and Sir Charles Macnaghten, K.C., son of Lord Macnaghten, the\r\ndistinguished Lord of Appeal. Ulster at this time gave a lead on the\r\nquestion of admitting women to political power, at a time when their\r\nclaim to enfranchisement was being strenuously resisted in England, by\r\nincluding several women in the Provisional Government.\r\n\r\nA most carefully drawn scheme for a separate judiciary in Ulster had\r\nbeen prepared with the assistance of some of the ablest lawyers in\r\nIreland. It was in three parts, dealing respectively with (a) the\r\nSupreme Court, (b) the Land Commission, and (c) County Courts; it was\r\ndrawn up as an Ordinance, in the usual form of a Parliamentary Bill, and\r\nit is an indication of the spirit in which Ulster was preparing to\r\nresist an Act of Parliament that the Ordinance bore the introductory\r\nheading: \"_It is Hereby Enacted by the Central Authority in the name of\r\nthe King's Most Excellent Majesty that_------\" Similarly, the form of\r\n\"Oath or Declaration of Adherence\" to be taken by Judges, Magistrates,\r\nCoroners, and other officers of the Courts, set out in a Schedule to the\r\nOrdinance, was: \"I ... of ... being about to serve in the Courts of the\r\nProvisional Government as the Central Authority for His Majesty the\r\nKing, etc.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the original resolution by which the Council\r\ndecided to set up a Provisional Government limited its duration until\r\nUlster should \"again resume unimpaired her citizenship in the United\r\nKingdom,\"[48] and at a later date it was explicitly stated that it was\r\nto act as trustee for the Imperial Parliament. All the forms prepared\r\nfor use while it remained in being purported to be issued in the name of\r\nthe King. And the Resolution adopted by the Unionist Council immediately\r\nafter constituting itself the Central Authority of the Provisional\r\nGovernment, in which the reasons for that policy were recorded,\r\nconcluded with the statement that \"we, for our part, in the course we\r\nhave determined to pursue, are inspired not alone by regard to the true\r\nwelfare of our own country, but by devotion to the interests of our\r\nworld-wide Empire and loyalty to our beloved King.\" If this was the\r\nlanguage of rebels, it struck a note that can never before have been\r\nheard in a chorus of disaffection.\r\n\r\nThe demonstrations against the Government's policy which had been held\r\nduring the last eighteen months, of which some account has been given,\r\nwere so impressive that those which followed were inevitably less\r\nremarkable by comparison. They were, too, necessarily to a large\r\nextent, repetitions of what had gone before. There might be, and there\r\nwere, plenty of variations on the old theme, but there was no new theme\r\nto introduce. Propaganda to the extent possible with the resources at\r\nthe disposal of the Ulster Unionist Council was carried on in the\r\nBritish constituencies in 1913, the cost being defrayed chiefly through\r\ngenerous subscriptions collected by the energy and influence of Mr.\r\nWalter Long; but many were beginning to share the opinion of Mr. Charles\r\nCraig, M.P., who scandalised the Radicals by saying at Antrim in March\r\nthat, while it was incumbent on Ulstermen to do their best to educate\r\nthe electorate, \"he believed that, as an argument, ten thousand pounds\r\nspent on rifles would be a thousand times stronger than the same amount\r\nspent on meetings, speeches, and pamphlets.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of March a letter appeared in the London newspapers\r\nannouncing the formation of a \"British League for the support of Ulster\r\nand the Union,\" with an office in London. It was signed by a hundred\r\nPeers and 120 Unionist Members of the House of Commons. The manifesto\r\nemphasised the Imperial aspect of the great struggle that was going on,\r\nasserting that it was \"quite clear that the men of Ulster are not\r\nfighting only for their own liberties. Ulster will be the field on which\r\nthe privileges of the whole nation will be lost or won.\" A small\r\nexecutive Committee was appointed, with the Duke of Bedford as Chairman,\r\nand within a few weeks large numbers of people in all parts of the\r\ncountry joined the new organisation. A conference attended by upwards of\r\n150 honorary agents from all parts of the country was held at\r\nLondonderry House on the 4th of June, where the work of the League was\r\ndiscussed, and its future policy arranged. Its operations were not\r\nostentatious, but they were far from being negligible, especially in\r\nconnection with later developments of the movement in the following\r\nyear. This proof of British support was most encouraging to the people\r\nof Ulster, and the Dublin correspondent of _The Times_ reported that it\r\ngave no less satisfaction to loyalists in other parts of Ireland, among\r\nwhom, as the position became more desperate every day, there was \"not\r\nthe least sign of giving way, of accepting the inevitable.\"\r\n\r\nEvery month that passed in uncertainty as to what fate was reserved for\r\nUlster, and especially every visit of the leader to Belfast, endeared\r\nhim more intensely to his followers, who had long since learnt to give\r\nhim their unquestioning trust; and his bereavement by the death of his\r\nwife in April 1913 brought him the profound and affectionate sympathy of\r\na warm-hearted people, which manifested itself in most moving fashion at\r\na great meeting a month later on the 16th of May, when, at the opening\r\nof a new drill hall in the most industrial district of Belfast, Sir\r\nEdward exclaimed, in response to a tumultuous reception, \"Heaven knows,\r\nmy one affection left me is my love of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nHe took occasion at the same meeting to impress upon his followers the\r\nspirit by which all their actions should be guided, and which always\r\nguided his own. With a significant reference to the purposes for which\r\nthe new drill hall might be used, he added, \"Always remember--this is\r\nessential--always remember you have no quarrel with individuals. We\r\nwelcome and we love every individual Irishman, even though he may be\r\nopposed to us. Our quarrel is with the Government.\" When the feelings of\r\nmasses of men are deeply stirred in political conflict such exhortations\r\nare never superfluous; and there never was a leader who could give them\r\nwith better grace than Sir Edward Carson, who himself combined to an\r\nextraordinary degree strength of conviction with entire freedom from\r\nbitterness towards individual opponents.[49]\r\n\r\nIn this same speech he showed that there was no slackening of\r\ndetermination to pursue to the end the policy of the Covenant. There had\r\nbeen rumours that the Government were making secret inquiries with a\r\nview to taking legal proceedings, and in allusion to them Carson moved\r\nhis audience to one of the most wonderful demonstrations of personal\r\ndevotion that even he ever evoked, by saying: \"If they want to test the\r\nlegality of anything we are doing, let them not attack humble men--I am\r\nresponsible for everything, and they know where to find me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bill was running its course for the second time through Parliament,\r\na course that was now farcically perfunctory, and Carson returned to\r\nLondon to repeat in the House of Commons on the 10th of June his defiant\r\nacceptance of responsibility for the Ulster preparations. He was back in\r\nBelfast for the 12th of July celebrations, when 150,000 Orangemen\r\nassembled at Craigavon to hear another speech from their leader full of\r\nconfident challenge, and to receive another message of encouragement\r\nfrom Mr. Bonar Law, who assured them that \"whatever steps they might\r\nfeel compelled to take, whether they were constitutional, or whether in\r\nthe long run they were unconstitutional, they had the whole of the\r\nUnionist Party under his leadership behind them.\"\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Unionist Party had good reason to know that his\r\nmessage to Ulster was endorsed by his followers. That had been\r\ndemonstrated beyond all possibility of doubt during the preceding month.\r\nThe Ulster Unionist Members of the House of Commons, with Carson at\r\ntheir head, had during June made a tour of some of the principal towns\r\nof Scotland and the North of England, receiving a resounding welcome\r\nwherever they went. The usual custom of political meetings, where one or\r\ntwo prominent speakers have the platform to themselves, was departed\r\nfrom; the whole parliamentary contingent kept together throughout the\r\ntour as a deputation from Ulster to the constituencies visited, taking\r\nin turn the duty of supporting Carson, who was everywhere the principal\r\nspeaker.\r\n\r\nThere were wonderful demonstrations at Glasgow and Edinburgh, both in\r\nthe streets and the principal halls, proving, as was aptly said by _The\r\nYorkshire Post_, that \"the cry of the new Covenanters is not unheeded by\r\nthe descendants of the old\"; and thence they went south, drawing great\r\ncheering crowds to welcome them and to present encouraging addresses at\r\nthe railway stations at Berwick, Newcastle, Darlington, and York, to\r\nLeeds, where the two largest buildings in the city were packed to\r\noverflowing with Yorkshiremen eager to see and hear the Ulster leader,\r\nand to show their sympathy with the loyalist cause. Similar scenes were\r\nwitnessed at Norwich and Bristol, and the tour left no doubt in the\r\nminds of those who followed it, and who studied the comments of the\r\nPress upon it, that not only was the whole Unionist Party in Great\r\nBritain solidly behind the Ulstermen in their resolve to resist being\r\nsubjected to a Parliament in Dublin, but that the general drift of\r\nopinion detached from party was increasingly on the same side.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] See _ante_, p. 53.\r\n\r\n[49] But he could be moved to stern indignation by the treachery of\r\nformer friends, as he showed in December 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nLORD LOREBURN'S LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever might be the state of public opinion in England, it was\r\nrealised that the Government, if they chose, were in a position to\r\ndisregard it; and in Ulster the tension was becoming almost unbearable.\r\nThe leaders were apprehensive lest outbreaks of violence should occur,\r\nwhich they knew would gravely prejudice the movement; and there is no\r\ndoubt that it was only the discipline which the rank and file had now\r\ngained, and the extraordinary restraining influence which Carson\r\nexercised, that prevented serious rioting in many places. Incidents like\r\nthe attack by Nationalist roughs in Belfast on a carriage conveying\r\ncrippled children to a holiday outing on the 31st of May because it was\r\ndecorated with Union Jacks might at any moment lead to trouble. There\r\nwas some disorder in Belfast in the early hours of the 12th of July; and\r\nan outbreak occurred in August in Derry, always a storm centre, when a\r\nprocession was attacked, and a Protestant was shot while watching it\r\nfrom his own upper window. The incident started rioting, which continued\r\nfor several days, and a battalion of troops had to be called in to\r\nrestore order.\r\n\r\nMeantime, throughout the summer, while the Government were complacently\r\ncarrying their Bill through Parliament for the second time, the Press\r\nwas packed with suggestions for averting the crisis which everybody\r\nexcept the Cabinet recognised as impending.\r\n\r\nIt began to be whispered in the clubs and lobbies that the King might\r\nexercise the prerogative of veto, and even men like Lord St. Aldwyn and\r\nthe veteran Earl of Halsbury, both of them ex-Cabinet Ministers,\r\nencouraged the idea; but there was no widespread acceptance of the\r\nnotion that even in so exceptional a case His Majesty would reject the\r\nadvice of his responsible Ministers. But in a letter to _The Times_ on\r\nthe 4th of September, Mr. George Cave, K.C., M.P. (afterwards Home\r\nSecretary, and ultimately Lord of Appeal), suggested that the King might\r\n\"exercise his undoubted right\" to dissolve Parliament before the\r\nbeginning of the next session, in order to inform himself as to whether\r\nthe policy of his Ministers was endorsed by the people.\r\n\r\nBut a much greater sensation was created a few days later by a letter\r\nwhich appeared in _The Times_ on the 11th of the same month over the\r\nsignature of Lord Loreburn. Lord Loreburn had been Lord Chancellor at\r\nthe time the Home Rule Bill was first introduced, but had retired from\r\nthe Government in June 1912, being replaced on the Woolsack by Lord\r\nHaldane. When the first draft of the Home Rule Bill was under discussion\r\nin the Cabinet in preparation for its introduction in the House of\r\nCommons, two of the younger Ministers, Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Winston\r\nChurchill, proposed that an attempt should be made to avert the stern\r\nopposition to be expected from Ulster, by treating the northern\r\nProvince, or a portion of it, separately from the rest of Ireland. This\r\nproposal was not acceptable to the Cabinet as a whole, and its authors\r\nwere roundly rated by Lord Loreburn for so unprincipled a lapse from\r\northodox Gladstonian doctrine. What, therefore, must have been the\r\nastonishment of the heretics when they found their mentor, less than two\r\nyears later, publicly reproving the Government which he had left for\r\nhaving got into such a sad mess over the Ulster difficulty! They might\r\nbe forgiven some indignation at finding themselves reproved by Lord\r\nLoreburn for faulty statesmanship of which Lord Loreburn was the\r\nprincipal author.\r\n\r\nThose, however, who had not the same ground for exasperation as Mr.\r\nLloyd George and Mr. Churchill thought Lord Loreburn's letter very sound\r\nsense. He pointed out that if the Bill were to become law in 1914, as it\r\nstood in September 1913, there would be, if not civil war, at any rate\r\nvery serious rioting in the North of Ireland, and when the riots had\r\nbeen quelled by the Government the spirit that prompted them would\r\nremain. Everybody concerned would suffer from fighting it out to a\r\nfinish. The Ex-Chancellor felt bound to assume that \"up to the last,\r\nMinisters, who assuredly have not taken leave of their senses, would be\r\nwilling to consider proposals for accommodation,\" and he therefore\r\nsuggested that a Conference should be held behind closed doors with a\r\nview to a settlement by consent. If Lord Loreburn had perceived at the\r\ntime the draft Bill was before the Cabinet that it was not the Ministers\r\nwho proposed separate treatment for Ulster who had \"taken leave of their\r\nsenses,\" but those, including himself, who had resisted that proposal,\r\nhis wisdom would have been more timely; but it was better late than\r\nnever, and his unexpected intervention had a decided influence on\r\nopinion in the country.\r\n\r\nThe comment of _The Times_ was very much to the point:\r\n\r\n     \"On the eve of a great political crisis, it may be of national\r\n     disaster, a distinguished Liberal statesman makes public confession\r\n     of his belief that, as a permanent solution, the Irish policy of\r\n     the Government is indefensible.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter of the ex-Lord Chancellor gave rise to prolonged discussion\r\nin the Press and on the platform. At Durham, on the 13th of September,\r\nCarson declared that he would welcome a Conference if the question was\r\nhow to provide a genuine expansion of self-government, but that, if\r\nUlster was to be not only expelled from the Union but placed under a\r\nParliament in Dublin, then \"they were going to make Home Rule impossible\r\nby steady and persistent opposition.\" The Government seemed unable to\r\nagree whether a conciliatory or a defiant attitude was their wiser\r\npolicy, though it is true that the latter recommended itself mostly to\r\nthe least prominent of its members, such as Mr. J.M. Robertson,\r\nSecretary of the Board of Trade, who in a speech at Newcastle on the\r\n25th of September announced scornfully that Ministers were not going to\r\nturn \"King Carson\" into \"Saint Carson\" by prosecuting him, and that \"the\r\nGovernment would know how to deal with him.\"[50] But more important\r\nMinisters were beginning to perceive the unwisdom of this sort of\r\nbluster. Lord Morley, in the House of Lords, denied that he had ever\r\nunderrated the Ulster difficulty, and said that for twenty-five years he\r\nhad never thought that Ulster was guilty of bluff. Mr. Churchill, at\r\nDundee, on the 9th of October, no longer talked as he had the previous\r\nyear about \"not taking Sir Edward Carson too seriously,\" though he still\r\nappeared to be ignorant of the fact that there was in Ulster anybody\r\nexcept Orangemen. \"The Orange Leaders,\" he said, \"used violent language,\r\nbut Liberals should try to understand their position. Their claim for\r\nspecial consideration, if put forward with sincerity, could not be\r\nignored by a Government depending on the existing House.\"[51]\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, less assured than his subordinate at the Board of\r\nTrade that \"King Carson\" was negligible, also displayed a somewhat\r\nchastened spirit at Ladybank on the 25th of October, when he\r\nacknowledged that it was \"of supreme importance to the future well-being\r\nof Ireland that the new system should not start with the apparent\r\ntriumph of one section over another,\" and he invited a \"free and frank\r\nexchange of views.\"[52] Sir Edward Grey held out another little twig of\r\nolive two days later at Berwick.\r\n\r\nTo these overtures, if they deserve the name, Mr. Bonar Law replied in\r\nan address to a gathering of fifteen thousand people at Wallsend on the\r\n29th, in the presence of Sir Edward Carson. Having repeated the Blenheim\r\npledge, he praised the discipline and restraint shown by the Ulster\r\npeople and their leaders, but warned his hearers that the nation was\r\ndrifting towards the tragedy of civil war, the responsibility for which\r\nwould rest on the Government. He expressed his readiness to respond to\r\nMr. Asquith's invitation, but pointed out that there were only three\r\nalternatives open to the Government. They must either (1) go on as they\r\nwere doing and provoke Ulster to resist--that was madness; (2) they\r\ncould consult the electorate, whose decision would be accepted by the\r\nUnionist Party as a whole; or (3) they could try to arrange a settlement\r\nwhich would at least avert civil war.\r\n\r\nThere had been during the past six or eight months an unusual dearth of\r\nby-elections to test public opinion in regard to the Irish policy of the\r\nGovernment, and it must be borne in mind that the Unionist Party in\r\nGreat Britain was still distracted by disputes over the Tariff question,\r\nwhich in January 1913 had very nearly led to the retirement of Mr. Bonar\r\nLaw from the leadership. Nevertheless, in May the Unionists won two\r\nsignal victories, one in Cambridgeshire, and one in Cheshire, where the\r\nAltrincham Division sent a staunch friend of Ulster to Parliament in the\r\nperson of Mr. George C. Hamilton, who in his maiden speech declared that\r\nhe had won the contest entirely on the Ulster Question. Even more\r\nsignificant, perhaps, were two elections which were fought while the\r\ninterchange of party strokes over the Loreburn letter was in progress,\r\nand the results of both were declared on the 8th of November. At\r\nReading, where the Unionists retained the seat, the Liberal candidate\r\nwas constrained by pressure of opinion in the constituency to promise\r\nsupport for a policy of \"separate and generous treatment for Ulster.\" At\r\nLinlithgow, a Liberal stronghold, where no such promise was forthcoming,\r\nthe Liberal majority, in spite of a large Nationalist vote, was reduced\r\nby 1,500 votes as compared with the General Election. There were signs\r\nthat Nonconformists, whose great leaders like Spurgeon and Dale had been\r\nhostile to Home Rule in Gladstone's time, were again becoming uneasy\r\nabout handing over the Ulster Presbyterians and Methodists to the Roman\r\nhierarchy. A memorial against Home Rule, signed by 131,000 people, which\r\nhad been presented to the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in\r\nJune, had no doubt had some effect on Nonconformist opinion in England,\r\nand it was just about the time when these elections took place that\r\nCarson was described at a large gathering of Nonconformists in London as\r\n\"the best embodiment at this moment of the ancient spirit of\r\nNonconformity.\"[53]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the people in Ulster were steadily maturing their plans. The\r\narrangements already mentioned for setting up a Provisional Government\r\nwere confirmed and finally adopted by the Unionist Council in Belfast on\r\nthe 24th of September, and the Council by resolution delegated its\r\npowers to the Standing Committee, while the Commission of Five was at\r\nthe same time appointed to act as an Executive. Carson, in accepting the\r\nchairmanship of the Central Authority, used the striking phrase, which\r\nprecisely epitomised the situation, that \"Ulster might be coerced into\r\nsubmission, but in that case would have to be governed as a conquered\r\ncountry.\" The Nationalist retort that the rest of Ireland was now being\r\nso treated, appeared forcible to those Englishmen only who could see no\r\ndifference between controlling a disaffected population and chastising a\r\nloyal one.\r\n\r\nAt the same meeting of the Ulster Unionist Council on the 24th of\r\nSeptember a guarantee fund was established for providing means to\r\ncompensate members of the U.V.F. for any loss or disability they might\r\nsuffer as a result of their service, and the widows and dependents of\r\nany who might lose their lives. This was a matter that had caused Carson\r\nanxiety for some time. He was extremely sensitive to the moral\r\nresponsibility he would incur towards those who so eagerly followed his\r\nlead, in the event of their suffering loss of life or limb in the\r\nservice of Ulster. His proposal that a guarantee fund of a million\r\nsterling should be started, met with a ready response from the Council,\r\nand from the wealthier classes in and about Belfast. The form of\r\n\"Indemnity Guarantee\" provided for the payment to those entitled to\r\nbenefit under it of sums not less than they would have been entitled to\r\nunder the Fatal Accidents Act, the Employers' Liability Act, and the\r\nWorkman's Compensation Act, as the circumstances of the case might be.\r\nThe list was headed by Sir Edward Carson, Lord Londonderry, Captain\r\nCraig, Sir John Lonsdale, Sir George Clark, and Lord Dunleath, with a\r\nsubscription of £10,000 each, and their example was followed by Mr. Kerr\r\nSmiley, M.P., Mr. R.M. Liddell, Mr. George Preston, Mr. Henry Musgrave,\r\nMr. C.E. Allen, and Mr. Frank Workman, who entered their names\r\nseverally for the same amount. A quarter of a million sterling was\r\nguaranteed in the room before the Council separated; by the end of a\r\nweek it had grown to £387,000; and before the 1st of January, 1914, the\r\ntotal amount of the Indemnity Guarantee Fund was £1,043,816.\r\n\r\nIt gave Carson and the other leaders the greatest possible satisfaction\r\nthat the response to this appeal was so prompt and adequate. Not only\r\nwas their anxiety relieved in regard to their responsibility to loyal\r\nfollowers of the rank and file who might become \"casualties\" in the\r\nmovement, but they had been given a striking proof that the business\r\ncommunity of Belfast did not consider its pocket more sacred than its\r\nprinciples. Moreover, if there had been doubt on that score in anyone's\r\nmind, it was set at rest by a memorable meeting for business men only\r\nheld in Belfast on the 3rd of November. Between three and four thousand\r\nleaders of industry and commerce, the majority of whom had never\r\nhitherto taken any active share in political affairs, presided over by\r\nMr. G.H. Ewart, President of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, gave an\r\nenthusiastic reception to Carson, who told them that he had come more to\r\nconsult them as to the commercial aspects of the great political\r\ncontroversy than to impress his own views on the gathering. It was said\r\nthat the men in the hall represented a capital of not less than\r\n£145,000,000 sterling,[54] and there can be no doubt that, even if that\r\nwere an exaggerated estimate, they were not of a class to whom\r\nrevolution, rebellion, or political upheaval could offer an attractive\r\nprospect. Nevertheless, the meeting passed with complete unanimity a\r\nresolution expressing confidence in Carson and approval of everything he\r\nhad done, including the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Force, and\r\ndeclaring that they would refuse to pay \"all taxes which they could\r\ncontrol\" to an Irish Parliament in Dublin. This meeting was very\r\nsatisfactory, for it proved that the \"captains of industry\" were\r\nentirely in accord with the working classes, whose support of the\r\nmovement had never been in doubt. It showed that Ulster was solid\r\nbehind Carson; and the unanimity was emphasised rather than disturbed by\r\na little handful of cranks, calling themselves \"Protestant Home Rulers,\"\r\nwho met on the 24th of October at the village of Ballymoney \"to protest\r\nagainst the lawless policy of Carsonism.\" The principal stickler for\r\npropriety of conduct in public life on this occasion was Sir Roger\r\nCasement.\r\n\r\nWhile the unity and steadfastness--which enemies called obstinacy--of\r\nthe Ulster people were being thus made manifest, the public in England\r\nwere hearing a good deal about the growth of the Ulster Volunteer Force\r\nin numbers and efficiency. As will be seen later, the anniversary of the\r\nCovenant was celebrated with great military display at the very time\r\nwhen the newspapers across the Channel were busy discussing Lord\r\nLoreburn's letter, and at a parade service in the Ulster Hall, Canon\r\nHarding, after pronouncing the Benediction, called on the congregation\r\nto raise their right hands and pledge themselves thereby \"to follow\r\nwherever Sir Edward Carson shall lead us.\"\r\n\r\nThe events of September 1913--the setting up of the Provisional\r\nGovernment, the wonderful and instantaneous response to the appeal for\r\nan Indemnity Guarantee Fund, the rapid formation of an effective\r\nvolunteer army--were given the fullest publicity in the English Press.\r\nEvery newspaper of importance had its special correspondent in Belfast,\r\nwhose telegrams filled columns every day, adorned with all the varieties\r\nof sensational headline type. The Radicals were becoming restive. The\r\nidea that Carson was \"not to be taken too seriously,\" had apparently\r\nmissed fire. It was the Ministerial affectation of contempt that no one\r\nwas taking seriously; in fact, to borrow an expression from current\r\nslang, the \"King Carson\" stunt was a \"wash-out.\"\r\n\r\n_The Nation_ suggested that, instead of being laughed at, the Ulster\r\nleader should be prosecuted, or, at any rate, removed from the Privy\r\nCouncil, and other Liberal papers feverishly took up the suggestion,\r\ndebating whether the indictment should be under the Treason Felony Act\r\nof 1848, the Crimes Act of 1887, or the Unlawful Drilling Act of 1819.\r\nOne of them, however, which succeeded in keeping its head, did not\r\nbelieve that a prosecution would succeed; and, as to the Privy Council,\r\nif Carson's name were removed, what about Londonderry and F.E. Smith,\r\nWalter Long, and Bonar Law? In fact, \"it would be difficult to know\r\nwhere to stop.\"[55] It would have been. The Privy Council would have had\r\nto be reduced to a committee of Radical politicians; and, if Carson had\r\nbeen prosecuted, room would have had to be found in the dock, not only\r\nfor the whole Unionist Party, but for the proprietors and editors of\r\nmost of the leading journals. The Government stopped short of that\r\nsupreme folly; but their impotence was the measure of the prevailing\r\nsympathy with Ulster.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] _Annual Register_, 1913, p. 205.\r\n\r\n[51] Ibid., p. 209.\r\n\r\n[52] Ibid., p. 220.\r\n\r\n[53] _Annual Register_, 1913, p. 225.\r\n\r\n[54] _Annual Register_, 1913, p. 225.\r\n\r\n[55] _Liverpool Daily Post and Mercury_, September 22nd, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS AND PROPOSALS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in a former chapter how the Ulster Volunteer Force\r\noriginated. It was never formally established by the act of any\r\nrecognised authority, but rather grew spontaneously from the zeal of the\r\nUnionist Clubs and the Orange Lodges to present an effective and\r\nformidable appearance at the demonstrations which marked the progress of\r\nthe movement after the meeting at Craigavon in 1911. By the following\r\nsummer it had attained considerable numbers and respectable efficiency,\r\nand was becoming organised, without violation of the law, on a\r\nterritorial basis under local officers, many of whom had served in the\r\nArmy. Early in 1913 the Standing Committee resolved that these units\r\nshould be combined into a single force, to be called The Ulster\r\nVolunteer Force, which was to be raised and limited to a strength of\r\n100,000 men, all of whom should be men who had signed the Covenant. When\r\nthis organisation took place it became obvious that a serious defect was\r\nthe want of a Commander-in-Chief of the whole force, to give it unity\r\nand cohesion. This defect was pressed on the attention of the leaders of\r\nthe movement, who then began to look about for a suitable officer of\r\nrank and military experience to take command of the U.V.F. Among English\r\nMembers of the House of Commons there was no firmer friend of Ulster\r\nthan Colonel Thomas Hickman, C.B., D.S.O., who has been mentioned as one\r\nof those who consented to serve in the Provisional Government. Hickman\r\nhad seen a lot of active service, having served with great distinction\r\nin Egypt and the Soudan under Kitchener, and in the South African War.\r\nIt was natural to take him into confidence in the search for a general;\r\nand, when he was approached, it was decided that he should consult Lord\r\nRoberts, whose warm sympathy with the Ulster cause was well known to the\r\nleaders of the movement, and whose knowledge of army officers of high\r\nrank was, of course, unequalled. Moreover, the illustrious Field-Marshal\r\nhad dropped hints which led those concerned to conjecture that in the\r\nlast resort he might not himself be unwilling to lend his matchless\r\nprestige and genius to the loyalist cause in Ireland. The contingency\r\nwhich might bring about such an accession had not, however, yet arisen,\r\nand might never arise; in the meantime, Lord Roberts gave a ready ear to\r\nHickman's application, which, after some weeks of delay, he answered in\r\nthe following letter, which was at once communicated to Carson and those\r\nin his immediate confidence:\r\n\r\n     \"ENGLEMERE, ASCOT, BERKS.\r\n\r\n     \"_4th June_, 1913.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR HICKMAN,\r\n\r\n     \"I have been a long time finding a Senior Officer to help in the\r\n     Ulster business, but I think I have got one now. His name is\r\n     Lieut.-General Sir George Richardson, K.C.B., c/o Messrs. Henry S.\r\n     King & Co., Pall Mall, S.W. He is a retired Indian officer, active\r\n     and in good health. He is not an Irishman, but has settled in\r\n     Ireland.... Richardson will be in London for about a month, and is\r\n     ready to meet you at any time.\r\n\r\n     \"I am sorry to read about the capture of rifles.\r\n\r\n     \"Believe me,\r\n\r\n     \"Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n     \"ROBERTS.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter was quickly arranged, and within a few weeks Sir George\r\nRichardson had taken up his residence in Belfast, and his duties as\r\nG.O.C. the Ulster Volunteer Force.\r\n\r\nHe was a distinguished soldier. He served under Roberts in the Afghan\r\nCampaign of 1879-80; he took part in the Waziri Expedition of 1881, and\r\nthe Zhob Valley Field Force operations of 1890. He was in command of a\r\nFlying Column in the Tirah Expedition of 1897-8, and of a Cavalry\r\nBrigade in the China Expeditionary Force in 1900, and had commanded a\r\nDivision at Poona for three years before retiring in 1907. He had been\r\nthree times mentioned in despatches, besides receiving a brevet and many\r\nmedals and clasps. He was at this time sixty-six years of age, but, like\r\nthe great soldier who recommended him to Ulster, he was an active little\r\nman both in body and mind, with no symptom of approaching old age.\r\n\r\nGeneral Richardson was not long in making himself popular, not only with\r\nthe force under his command, but with all classes in Ulster. There were\r\nunavoidable difficulties in handling troops whose officers had no\r\nstatutory powers of discipline, who had inherited no military\r\ntraditions, and who formed part of a population conspicuously\r\nindependent in character. But Sir George Richardson was as full of tact\r\nas of good humour, and he soon found that the keenness of the officers\r\nand men, to whom dismissal from the U.V.F. would have been the severest\r\nof punishments, more than counterbalanced the difficulties referred to.\r\n\r\nWhen the new G.O.C. went to Belfast in July, 1913, he found his command\r\nbetween fifty and sixty thousand strong, with recruits joining every\r\nday. In September a number of parades were held in different localities,\r\nat which the General was accompanied by Sir Edward Carson, Mr. F.E.\r\nSmith, Captain James Craig, and other Members of Parliament. The local\r\nbattalions were in many cases commanded by retired or half-pay officers\r\nof the regular army. At all these inspections Carson addressed the men,\r\nmany of whom were now seeing their Commander-in-Chief for the first\r\ntime, and pointed out that the U.V.F., being now under a single command,\r\nwas no longer a mere collection of unrelated units, but an army. At an\r\ninspection at Antrim on the 21st of September, he made a disclosure\r\nwhich startled the country not a little next day when it appeared in the\r\nheadlines of English newspapers. \"I tell the Government,\" he said, \"that\r\nwe have pledges and promises from some of the greatest generals in the\r\narmy, who have given their word that, when the time comes, if it is\r\nnecessary, they will come over and help us to keep the old flag flying.\"\r\nThese promises were entirely spontaneous and unsolicited. More than one\r\nof those who made them did fine service to the Empire in the impending\r\ntime of trial which none of them foresaw in 1913.\r\n\r\nOf the men inspected on that day, numbering about 5,000, it was said by\r\nthe Special Correspondent of _The Yorkshire Post_, who was present--\r\n\r\n     \"As far as I could detect in a very careful observation, there were\r\n     not half a dozen of them unqualified by physique or age to play a\r\n     manly part. They reminded me more than anything else--except that\r\n     but few of them were beyond the best fighting age--of the finest\r\n     class of our National Reserve. There was certainly nothing of the\r\n     mock soldier about them. Led by keen, smart-looking officers, they\r\n     marched past in quarter column with fine, swinging steps, as if\r\n     they had been in training for years. Officers who have had the\r\n     teaching of them tell me that the rapidity with which they have\r\n     become efficient is greater than has ever come within their\r\n     experience in training recruits for either the Territorials or the\r\n     Regular Service.\"[56]\r\n\r\nThe 24th of September, it will be remembered, was the day when the\r\nformation of the Provisional Government and the Indemnity Fund (with the\r\nsubscription of a quarter of a million sterling in two hours) was made\r\npublic; on Saturday the 27th, the country parades of Volunteers of the\r\npreceding weeks reached a climax in a grand review in Belfast itself,\r\nwhen some 15,000 men were drawn up on the same ground where the Balmoral\r\nmeeting had been held eighteen months before. They were reviewed by Sir\r\nGeorge Richardson, G.O.C., and it was on this occasion that Mr. F.E.\r\nSmith became famous as \"galloper\" to the General. The Commanders of the\r\nfour regiments on parade--one from each parliamentary division of the\r\ncity--comprising fourteen battalions, were: Colonel Wallace, Major F.H.\r\nCrawford, Major McCalmont, M.P., and Captain the Hon. A.C. Chichester.\r\nMore than 30,000 sympathetic spectators watched the arrival and the\r\nreview of the troops.\r\n\r\nAmong these spectators were a large number of special military\r\ncorrespondents of English newspapers, whose impressions of this\r\nmemorable event were studied in every part of the United Kingdom on the\r\nfollowing Monday morning. That which appeared in a great Lancashire\r\njournal may be quoted as a fair and dispassionate account of the scene:\r\n\r\n     \"It is quite certain that the review of Volunteers at Balmoral\r\n     to-day will go down into history as one of the most extraordinary\r\n     events in the annals of these islands. Not since the marshalling of\r\n     Cromwell's Puritan army have we had anything approaching a\r\n     parallel; but, whereas the Puritans took up arms against a king of\r\n     whom they disapproved, the men of Ulster strongly protest their\r\n     loyalty to the British Throne. The great crowd which lined the\r\n     enclosure was eager, earnest, and sympathetic. It was not a\r\n     boisterous crowd. On the contrary, beyond the demonstration\r\n     following the call for cheers for the Union there was comparatively\r\n     little cheering. The crowd seemed burdened with a heavy sense of\r\n     the importance of the occasion. The conduct of the gathering was\r\n     serious to the point of positive solemnity.\r\n\r\n     \"The Volunteers from their own ranks policed the grounds, not a\r\n     solitary member of the Royal Irish Constabulary being seen in the\r\n     enclosure. The sun shone brilliantly as Colonel Wallace led the men\r\n     of the North division into the enclosure. Amidst subdued cheers he\r\n     marched them across the field in fours, forming up in quarter\r\n     column by the right, facing left. For an hour and a quarter the\r\n     procession filed through the gates, the men taking up their\r\n     positions with perfect movement and not the faintest suggestion of\r\n     confusion. As the men from the West took up their position the\r\n     crowd broke into a great cheer. They mustered only two battalions,\r\n     but they had come from Mr. Devlin's constituency!\r\n\r\n     \"As a body the men were magnificent. The hardy sons of toil from\r\n     shipyards and factories marched shoulder to shoulder with clergy\r\n     and doctors, professional men and clerks. From the saluting base\r\n     General Richardson took command, and almost immediately Sir Edward\r\n     Carson took up his position on the platform, with Lord Londonderry\r\n     and Captain Craig in attendance. Then followed a scene that will\r\n     live long in the memories of that vast concourse of people. With\r\n     the men standing to 'Attention,' the bands struck up the 'British\r\n     Grenadiers,' and the whole division advanced in review order, in\r\n     perfect lines and unison.\r\n\r\n     \"The supreme moment had arrived. The men took off their hats, and\r\n     the G.O.C. shouted, 'I call upon the men to give three cheers for\r\n     the Union, taking their time from me. Hip, hip----'\r\n\r\n     \"Well, people who were not there must imagine the rest. Out of the\r\n     deafening cheers came the strains of 'Rule, Britannia!' from the\r\n     bands; the monster Union Jack was unfurled in the centre of the\r\n     ground, and the mighty gathering stood bare-headed to 'God save the\r\n     King.' It was solemn, impressive, thrilling.\"[57]\r\n\r\nThe following day, Sunday, was \"Ulster Day,\" the first anniversary of\r\nthe signing of the Covenant, and it was celebrated in Belfast and many\r\nother places in Ulster by holding special services in all places of\r\nworship, which had the effect of sustaining that spirit of high\r\nseriousness which struck all observers as remarkable in the behaviour of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThis week, in which occurred the proclamation of the Provisional\r\nGovernment, the great review of the Belfast Volunteers, and the second\r\ncelebration of Ulster Day, was a notable landmark in the movement. The\r\nPress in England and Scotland gave the widest publicity to every\r\npicturesque and impressive detail, and there can be little doubt that\r\nthe idea of attempting to arrive at some agreed settlement, started by\r\nLord Loreburn's letter to _The Times_, was greatly stimulated by these\r\nfresh and convincing proofs of the grim determination of the Ulster\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAt all events, the autumn produced more than the usual plethora of\r\npolitical meetings addressed by \"front bench\" politicians on both sides,\r\neach answering each like an antiphonal choir; scraps of olive-branch\r\nwere timidly held out, only to be snatched back next day in panic lest\r\nsomeone had blundered in saying too much; while day by day a clamorous\r\nLiberal Press, to whom Ulster's loyalty to King and Empire was an\r\nunforgivable offence, alternated between execration of Ulster wickedness\r\nand affected ridicule of Ulster bluff. But it was evident that genuine\r\nmisgiving was beginning to be felt in responsible Liberal quarters. A\r\nCorrespondent of _The Manchester Guardian_ on the 25th of November made\r\na proposal for special treatment of Ulster; on the 1st of December Mr.\r\nMassingham, in _The Daily News_, urged that an effort should be made to\r\nconciliate the northern Protestants; and on the 6th Mr. Asquith\r\ndisplayed a more conciliatory spirit than usual in a speech at\r\nManchester. A most active campaign of propaganda in England and Scotland\r\nwas also carried on during the autumn by Ulster speakers, among whom\r\nwomen bore their full share. The Ulster Women's Unionist Association\r\nemployed 93 voluntary workers, who visited over 90 constituencies in\r\nGreat Britain, addressing 230 important meetings. It was reckoned that\r\nnot less than 100,000 electors heard the Ulster case from the lips of\r\nearnest Ulster women.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of December two Royal Proclamations were issued by the\r\nGovernment, prohibiting the importation of arms and ammunition into\r\nIreland. But during the Christmas holidays the impression gained ground\r\nthat the Government contemplated making concessions to Ulster, and\r\ncommunications in private between the Prime Minister and Sir Edward\r\nCarson did in fact take place at this time. The truth, however, was that\r\nthe Government were not their own masters, and, as Mr. Bonar Law bluntly\r\ndeclared at Bristol on the 15th of January, 1914, they were compelled by\r\nthe Nationalists, on whom they depended for existence, to refuse any\r\ngenuine concession. In the same speech Mr. Bonar Law replied to the\r\nallegation that Ulster was crying out before she was hurt, by saying\r\nthat the American colonies had done the same thing--they had revolted on\r\na question of principle while suffering was still distant, and for a\r\ncause that in itself was trivial in comparison with that of Ulster.[58]\r\n\r\nMost of the leaders on both sides were speaking on various platforms in\r\nJanuary. On the 17th Carson, at an inspection of the East Belfast\r\nU.V.F., said he had lately visited Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, and that the\r\ndying statesman, clear-sighted and valiant as ever, had said to him at\r\nparting, \"I would fight it out.\" In the same spirit Mr. Austen\r\nChamberlain, in a speech at Skipton a fortnight later, ridiculed any\r\nconcession that fell short of the exclusion of Ulster from the Irish\r\nParliament, and asserted that what the policy of the Government amounted\r\nto was that England was to conquer a province and hold it down at the\r\nexpense of her friends for the benefit of her enemies.[59]\r\n\r\nPublic attention was, however, not allowed to concentrate wholly on\r\nIreland. The Radicals, instigated by Sir John Brunner, President of the\r\nNational Liberal Federation, were doing their best to prevent the\r\nstrengthening of the Navy, the time being opportune for parsimony in Mr.\r\nLloyd George's opinion because our relations with Germany were \"far more\r\nfriendly than for years past.\"[60] The militant women suffragists were\r\ncarrying on a lively campaign of arson and assault all over the country.\r\nLabour unrest was in a condition of ferment. Land agitation was exciting\r\nthe \"single-taxers\" and other fanatics; and the Tariff question had not\r\nceased to be a cause of division in the Unionist Party. But, while these\r\nmatters were sharing with the Irish problem the attention of the Press\r\nand the public, \"conversations\" were being held behind the scenes with a\r\nview to averting what everyone now agreed would be a dangerous crisis if\r\nUlster proved implacable.\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament met on the 10th of February, 1914, Mr. Asquith referred\r\nto these conversations; but while he congratulated everyone concerned on\r\nthe fact that the Press had been successfully kept in the dark for\r\nmonths regarding them, he had to admit that they had produced no result.\r\nBut there were, he said, \"schemes and suggestions of settlement in the\r\nair,\" among them the exclusion of Ulster from the Bill, a proposal on\r\nwhich he would not at that moment \"pronounce, or attempt to pronounce,\r\nany final judgment\", and he then announced that, as soon as the\r\nfinancial business of the year was disposed of, he would bring forward\r\nproposals for the purpose of arriving at an agreement \"which will\r\nconsult not only the interests but the susceptibilities of all\r\nconcerned.\"\r\n\r\nThis appeared to be a notable change of attitude on the part of the\r\nGovernment; but it was received with not a little suspicion by the\r\nUnionist leaders. Whether or not the change was due, as Mr. William\r\nMoore bluntly asserted, to the formation of the Ulster Volunteer Force,\r\nwhich had now reached its full strength of 100,000 men, the question of\r\ninterest was whether the promised proposals would render that force\r\nunnecessary. Mr. Austen Chamberlain asked why the Government's proposals\r\nshould be kept bottled up until a date suspiciously near All Fools' Day;\r\nand Sir Edward Carson, in one of the most impressive speeches he ever\r\nmade in Parliament, which wrung from Mr. Lloyd George the acknowledgment\r\nthat it had \"entranced the House,\" joined Chamberlain in demanding that\r\nthe country should not be kept in anxious suspense. The only proper way\r\nof making the proposals known was, he said, by embodying them at once in\r\na Bill to amend the Home Rule Bill. He confirmed Chamberlain's statement\r\nthat nothing short of the exclusion of Ulster would be of the slightest\r\nuse. The Covenanters were not men who would have acted as they had done\r\nfor the sake of minor details that could be adjusted by \"paper\r\nsafeguards,\" they were \"fighting for a great principle and a great\r\nideal,\" and if their determination to resist was not morally justified\r\nhe \"did not see how resistance could ever be justified in history at\r\nall.\" But if the exclusion of Ulster was to be offered, he would\r\nimmediately go to Belfast and lay the proposal before his followers. He\r\ndid not intend \"that Ulster should be a pawn in any political game,\" and\r\nwould not allow himself to be manoeuvred into a position where it could\r\nafterwards be said that Ulster had resorted to arms to secure something\r\nthat had been rejected when offered by legislation. The sympathy of\r\nUlstermen with Loyalists in other parts of Ireland was as deep and\r\nsincere as ever, but no one had ever supposed that Ulster could by force\r\nof arms do more than preserve her own territory from subjection to\r\nDublin. As for the Nationalists, they would never succeed in coercing\r\nUlster, but \"by showing that good government can come under Home Rule\r\nthey might try and win her over to the case of the rest of Ireland.\"\r\nThat was a plan that had never yet been tried.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the announcement which Mr. Asquith had now made lay\r\nin the fact that it was an acknowledgment by the Government for the\r\nfirst time that there was an \"Ulster Question\" to be dealt with--that\r\nUlster was not, as had hitherto been the Liberal theory, like any other\r\nminority who must submit to the will of the majority opposed to it, but\r\na distinct community, conditioned by special circumstances entitling it\r\nto special treatment. The Prime Minister had thus, as Mr. Bonar Law\r\ninsisted, \"destroyed utterly the whole foundation on which for the last\r\ntwo years the treatment extended to Ulster in this Bill has been\r\njustified.\" From that day it became impossible ever again to contend\r\nthat Ulster was merely a recalcitrant minority in a larger unity,\r\nwithout rights of her own.\r\n\r\nThe speeches of the Unionist leaders in the House of Commons showed\r\nclearly enough how little faith they had that the Government intended to\r\ndo anything that could lead to an agreed settlement. The interval that\r\npassed before the nature of the Government's proposals was made known\r\nincreased rather than diminished this distrust. The air was full of\r\nsuggestions, the most notable of which was put forward by the veteran\r\nconstitutional lawyer, Mr. Frederic Harrison, who proposed that Ulster\r\nshould be governed by a separate committee elected by its own\r\nconstituencies, with full legislative, administrative, and financial\r\npowers, subject only to the Crown and the Imperial Parliament.[61]\r\nUnionists did not believe that the Liberal Cabinet would be allowed by\r\ntheir Nationalist masters to offer anything so liberal to Ulster; nor\r\ndid that Province desire autonomy for itself. They believed that the\r\nchief desire of the Government was not to appease Ulster, but to put her\r\nin a tactically indefensible position. This fear had been expressed by\r\nLord Lansdowne as long before as the previous October, when he wrote\r\nprivately to Carson in reference to Lord Loreburn's suggested Conference\r\nthat he suspected the intention of the Government to be \"to offer us\r\nterms which they know we cannot accept, and then throw on us the odium\r\nof having obstructed a settlement.\" Mr. Walter Long had the same\r\napprehension in March 1914 as to the purpose of Mr. Asquith's unknown\r\nproposals. Both these leaders herein showed insight and prescience, for\r\nnot only Mr. Asquith's Government, but also that which succeeded it, had\r\nresort on many subsequent occasions to the manoeuvre suspected by Lord\r\nLansdowne.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were encouraging signs in the country. To the\r\nintense satisfaction of Unionists, Mr. C.F.G. Masterman, who had just\r\nbeen promoted to the Cabinet, lost his seat in East London when he\r\nsought re-election in February, and a day or two later the Government\r\nsuffered another defeat in Scotland. On the 27th of February Lord\r\nMilner, a fearless supporter of the Ulster cause, wrote to Carson that a\r\nBritish Covenant had been drawn up in support of the Ulster Covenanters,\r\nand that the first signatures, in addition to his own, were those of\r\nField-Marshal Lord Roberts, Admiral of the Fleet Sir E. Seymour, the\r\nDuke of Portland, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, Lord Desborough, Lord Lovat,\r\nMr. Rudyard Kipling, Sir W. Ramsay, F.R.S., the Dean of Canterbury,\r\nProfessors Dicey and Goudy, Sir George Hayter Chubb, and Mr. Salvidge,\r\nthe influential alderman of Liverpool. On the 6th of March Mr. Walter\r\nLong, writing from the office of the Union Defence League, of which he\r\nwas President, was able to inform Carson that there was \"a rush to sign\r\nthe Covenant--we are really almost overpowered.\" This was supplemented\r\nby a women's Covenant, which, like the men's, \"had been numerously and\r\ninfluentially signed, about 3 or 4 per cent, of the signatories, it was\r\nsaid, being Liberals.\"[62] Long believed from this and other evidence\r\nthat had reached him that \"public opinion was now really aroused in the\r\ncountry,\" and that the steadfast policy of Ulster had the undoubted\r\nsupport of the electorate.\r\n\r\nOnly those who were in the confidence of Mr. Asquith and his colleagues\r\nat the beginning of 1914 can know whether the \"proposals\" they then made\r\nwere ever seriously put forward as an effort towards appeasement. If\r\nthey were sincerely meant for such, it implied a degree of ignorance of\r\nthe chief factor in the problem with which it is difficult to credit\r\nable Ministers who had been face to face with that problem for years.\r\nThey must have supposed that their leading opponents were capable of\r\nsaying emphatically one thing and meaning quite another. For the\r\nUnionist leaders had stated over and over again in the most unmistakable\r\nterms, both in the recent debate on the Address, and on innumerable\r\nformer occasions, that nothing except the \"exclusion of Ulster\" could\r\nfurnish a basis for negotiation towards settlement.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, when the Prime Minister at last put his cards on the table on\r\nthe 9th of March, in moving the second reading of the Home Rule\r\nBill--which now entered on its third and last lap under the Parliament\r\nAct--it was found that his much-trumpeted proposals were derisory to the\r\nlast degree. The scheme was that which came to be known as county option\r\nwith a time limit. Any county in Ulster, including the cities of Belfast\r\nand Derry, was to be given the right to vote itself out of the Home Rule\r\njurisdiction, on a requisition signed by a specified proportion of its\r\nparliamentary electorate, for a period of six years.\r\n\r\nMr. Bonar Law said at once, on behalf of the Unionist Party, that apart\r\nfrom all other objections to the Government scheme, and they were many,\r\nthe time limit for exclusion made the whole proposal a mockery. All that\r\nit meant was that when the preparations in Ulster for resistance to Home\r\nRule had been got rid of--for it would be practically impossible to keep\r\nthem in full swing for six years--Ulster should then be compelled to\r\nsubmit to the very thing to which she refused to submit now. Carson\r\ndescribed the proposal as a \"sentence of death with a stay of execution\r\nfor six years.\" He noted with satisfaction indeed the admission of the\r\nprinciple of exclusion, but expressed his conviction that the time limit\r\nhad been introduced merely in order to make it impossible for Ulster to\r\naccept. Ulster wanted the question settled once for all, so that she\r\nmight turn her attention from politics to her ordinary business. The\r\ntime limit would keep the fever of political agitation at a high\r\ntemperature for six years, and at the end of that period forcible\r\nresistance would be as necessary as ever, while in the interval all\r\nadministration would be paralysed by the unworkable nature of the system\r\nto be introduced for six years. Although there were other gross blots on\r\nthe scheme outlined by the Prime Minister, yet, if the time limit were\r\ndropped, Carson said he would submit it to a convention in Belfast; but\r\nhe utterly declined to do so if the time limit was to be retained.\r\n\r\nThe debate was adjourned indefinitely, and before it could be resumed\r\nthe whole situation was rendered still more grave by the events to be\r\nnarrated in the next chapter, and by a menacing speech delivered by Mr.\r\nChurchill at Bradford on the 14th of March. He hinted that, if Ulster\r\npersisted in refusing the offer made by the Prime Minister, which was\r\nthe Government's last word, the forces of the Crown would have to be\r\nemployed against her; there were, he said, \"worse things than bloodshed\r\neven on an extended scale\"; and he ended by saying, \"Let us go forward\r\ntogether and put these grave matters to the proof.\"[63] Two days later\r\nMr. Asquith, in answer to questions in the House of Commons, announced\r\nthat no particulars of the Government scheme would be given unless the\r\nprinciple of the proposals were accepted as a basis of agreement.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Unionist Party replied by moving a vote of censure on\r\nthe Government on the 19th of March. Mr. Churchill's Bradford speech,\r\nand one no less defiant by Mr. Devlin the day following it, had charged\r\nwith inflammable material the atmosphere in which the debate was\r\nconducted. Sir Edward Carson began his speech by saying that, after\r\nthese recent events, \"I feel that I ought not to be here, but in\r\nBelfast.\" There were some sharp passages between him and Churchill, whom\r\nhe accused of being anxious to provoke the Ulster people to make an\r\nattack on the soldiers. A highly provocative speech by Mr. Devlin\r\nfollowed, at the end of which Carson rose and left the House, saying\r\naudibly, \"I am off to Belfast.\" He was accompanied out of the Chamber by\r\neight Ulster members, and was followed by ringing and sustained cheers\r\nof encouragement and approval from the crowded Unionist benches. It was\r\na scene which those who witnessed it are not likely to forget.\r\n\r\nThe idea of accommodation between the combatant parties was at an end.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[56] _The Yorkshire Post_, September 22nd, 1913.\r\n\r\n[57] _The Liverpool Daily Courier_, September 29th, 1913.\r\n\r\n[58] _Annual Register_, 1914, p. 6.\r\n\r\n[59] _Annual Register_, 1914, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[60] Ibid., p. 1.\r\n\r\n[61] _The Annual Register_, 1914, p. 33.\r\n\r\n[62] _Annual Register_, 1914, pp. 51-2.\r\n\r\n[63] _The Times_, March 16th, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE CURRAGH INCIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Bonar Law moved the vote of censure on the Government on the\r\n19th of March he had no idea that the Cabinet had secretly taken in hand\r\nan enterprise which, had it been known, would have furnished infinitely\r\nstronger grounds for their impeachment than anything relating to their\r\n\"proposals\" for amending the Home Rule Bill. It was an enterprise that,\r\nwhen it did become known, very nearly brought about their fall from\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe whole truth about the famous \"Curragh Incident\" has never been\r\nascertained, and the answers given by the Ministers chiefly concerned,\r\nunder cross-examination in the House of Commons, were so evasive and in\r\nseveral instances so contradictory as to make it certain that they were\r\nexceedingly anxious that the truth should be concealed. But when the\r\navailable evidence is pieced together it leads almost irresistibly to\r\nthe conclusion that in March 1914 the Cabinet, or at any rate some of\r\nthe most prominent members of it, decided to make an imposing\r\ndemonstration of military force against Ulster, and that they expected,\r\nif they did not hope, that this operation would goad the Ulstermen into\r\na clash with the forces of the Crown, which, by putting them morally in\r\nthe wrong, would deprive them of the popular sympathy they enjoyed in so\r\nlarge and increasing a measure.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Churchill spoke at Bradford on the 14th of March of \"putting\r\nthese grave matters to the proof\" he was already deeply involved in what\r\ncame to be known as \"the plot against Ulster,\" to which his words were\r\ndoubtless an allusion. That plot may perhaps have originated at Mr.\r\nLloyd George's breakfast-table on the 11th, when he entertained Mr.\r\nRedmond, Mr. Dillon, Mr. Devlin, Mr. O'Connor, and the Chief Secretary\r\nfor Ireland, Mr. Birrell; for on the same day it was decided to send a\r\nsquadron of battleships with attendant cruisers and destroyers from the\r\ncoast of Spain to Lamlash, in the Isle of Arran, opposite Belfast Lough;\r\nand a sub-committee of the Cabinet, consisting of Lord Crewe, Mr.\r\nChurchill, Colonel Seely, Mr. Birrell, and Sir John Simon, was appointed\r\nto deal with affairs connected with Ulster. This sub-committee held its\r\nfirst meeting the following day, and the next was the date of Mr.\r\nChurchill's threatening speech at Bradford, with its reference to the\r\nprospect of bloodshed and of putting grave matters to the proof. Bearing\r\nin mind this sequence of events, it is not easy to credit the contention\r\nof the Government, after the plot had been discovered, that the despatch\r\nof the fleet to the neighbourhood of the Ulster coast had no connection\r\nwith the other naval and military operations which immediately followed.\r\n\r\nFor on the 14th, while Churchill was travelling in the train to\r\nBradford, Seely, the Secretary of State for War, was drafting a letter\r\nto Sir Arthur Paget, the Commander-in-Chief in Ireland, informing him of\r\nreports (it was never discovered where the reports, which were without\r\nthe smallest foundation, came from) that attempts might be made \"in\r\nvarious parts of Ireland by evil-disposed persons\" to raid Government\r\nstores of arms and ammunition, and instructing the General to \"take\r\nspecial precautions\" to safeguard the military depots. It was added that\r\n\"information shows that Armagh, Omagh, Carrickfergus, and Enniskillen\r\nare insufficiently guarded.\"[64] It is permissible to wonder, if there\r\nwas danger from evil-disposed persons \"in various parts of Ireland,\"\r\nfrom whom came the information that the places particularly needing\r\nreinforcements were a ring of strategically important towns round the\r\noutskirts of the loyalist counties of Ulster.\r\n\r\nWhatever the source of the alleged \"information\"--whether it originated\r\nat Mr. Lloyd George's breakfast-table or elsewhere--Seely evidently\r\nthought it alarmingly urgent, for within forty-eight hours he\r\ntelegraphed to Paget asking for a reply before 8 a.m. next morning as to\r\nwhat steps he had taken, and ordering the General to come at once to\r\nLondon, bringing with him detailed plans. On the 16th Sir A. Paget\r\ntelegraphed that he \"had taken all available steps\"; but, on second\r\nthoughts, he wrote on the 17th saying that there were sufficient troops\r\nat Enniskillen to guard the depot, that he was making a small increase\r\nto the detachment at Carrickfergus, and that, instead of strengthening\r\nthe garrisons of Omagh and Armagh, the stores there were being\r\nremoved--an operation that would take eight days. He explained his\r\nreason for this departure from instructions to be that such a movement\r\nof troops as had been ordered by the War Office would, \"in the present\r\nstate of the country, create intense excitement in Ulster and possibly\r\nprecipitate a crisis.\"[65]\r\n\r\nAs soon as this communication reached the War Office orders were sent\r\nthat the arms and ammunition at Omagh and Armagh, for the safety of\r\nwhich from evil-disposed persons Seely had been so apprehensive, were\r\nnot to be removed, although they had already been packed for transport.\r\nThis order was sent on the 18th of March, and on the same day Sir Arthur\r\nPaget arrived in London from Ireland and had a consultation with the\r\nUlster sub-committee of the Cabinet, and with Sir John French and other\r\nmembers of the Army Council at the War Office.\r\n\r\nNews of this meeting reached the ears of Sir Edward Carson, who was also\r\naware that a false report was being spread of attempts by Unionists to\r\ninfluence the Army, and in his speech on the vote of censure on the 19th\r\nhe said: \"I have never suggested that the Army should not be sent to\r\nUlster. I have never suggested that it should not do its duty when sent\r\nthere. I hope and expect it will.\" At the same time reports were\r\ncirculating in Dublin--did they come from Downing Street?--that the\r\nGovernment were preparing to take strong measures against the Ulster\r\nUnionist Council, and to arrest the leaders. In allusion to these\r\nreports the Dublin Correspondent of _The Times_ telegraphed on the 18th\r\nof March: \"Any man or Government that increases the danger by blundering\r\nor hasty action will accept a terrible responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nWhat passed at the interviews which Sir Arthur Paget had with Ministers\r\non the 18th and 19th has never been disclosed. But it is clear, from the\r\nevents which followed, either that an entirely new plan on a much larger\r\nscale was now inaugurated, or that a development now took place which\r\nChurchill and Seely, and perhaps other Ministers also, had contemplated\r\nfrom the beginning and had concealed behind the pretended insignificance\r\nof precautions to guard depots. It is noteworthy, at all events, that\r\nthe measures contemplated happened to be the stationing of troops in\r\nconsiderable strength in important strategical positions round Ulster,\r\nsimultaneously with the despatch of a powerful fleet to within a few\r\nhours of Belfast.\r\n\r\nThe orders issued by the War Office, at any rate, indicated something on\r\na far bigger scale than the original pretext could justify. Paget's fear\r\nof precipitating a crisis was brushed aside, and General Friend, who was\r\nacting for him in Dublin during his absence, was instructed by telegram\r\nto send to the four Ulster towns more than double the number of men that\r\nPaget had deemed would be sufficient to protect the Government stores.\r\nBut still more significant was another order given to Friend on the\r\n18th. The Dorset Regiment, quartered in the Victoria Barracks in\r\nBelfast, were to be moved four miles out to Holywood, taking with them\r\ntheir stores and ammunition, amounting to some thirty tons; and such was\r\nthe anxiety of the Government to get the troops out of the city that\r\nthey were told to leave their rifles behind, if necessary, after\r\nrendering them useless by removing the bolts.[66] The Government had\r\nvetoed Paget's plan of removing the stores from Omagh and Armagh,\r\nbecause their real object was to increase the garrisons at those places;\r\nbut, as they had no scruple about moving the much larger supply from the\r\nVictoria Barracks through the most intensely Orange quarter of Belfast,\r\nit could hardly be wondered at if such an order, under the\r\ncircumstances, was held to give colour to the idea that Ministers wished\r\nto provoke violent opposition to the troops. Not less inconsistent with\r\nthe original pretext was the despatch of a battalion to Newry and\r\nDundalk. At the latter place there was already a brigade of artillery,\r\nwith eighteen guns, which would prove a tough nut for \"evil-disposed\r\npersons\" to crack; and although both towns would be important points to\r\nhold with an army making war on Ulster, they were both in Nationalist\r\nterritory where there could be no fear of raids by Unionists. Yet the\r\nurgency was considered so great at the War Office to occupy these places\r\nin strength not later than the 20th that two cruisers were ordered to\r\nKingstown to take the troops to Dundalk by sea, if there should be\r\ndifficulty about land transport.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the actual design of Mr. Churchill and Colonel\r\nSeely, who appear to have practically taken the whole management of the\r\naffair into their own hands, the dispositions must have suggested to\r\nanyone with elementary knowledge of military matters that nothing less\r\nthan an overpowering attack on Belfast was in contemplation. The\r\ntransfer of the troops from Victoria Barracks, where they would have\r\nbeen useful to support the civil power in case of rioting, to Holywood,\r\nwhere they would be less serviceable for that purpose but where they\r\nwould be in rapid communication by water with the garrison of\r\nCarrickfergus on the opposite shore of the Lough; the ordering of H.M.S.\r\n_Pathfinder_ and _Attentive_ to Belfast Lough, where they were to arrive\r\n\"at daybreak on Saturday the 21st instant\" with instructions to support\r\nthe soldiers if necessary \"by guns and search-lights from the\r\nships[67]\"; the secret and rapid garrisoning of strategic points on all\r\nthe railways leading to Belfast,--all this pointed, not to the\r\nsafeguarding of stores of army boots and rifles, but to operations of an\r\noffensive campaign.\r\n\r\nIt was in this light that the Commander-in-Chief in Ireland himself\r\ninterpreted his instructions, and, seeing that he had taken the\r\nresponsibility of not fully obeying the much more modest orders he had\r\nreceived in Ireland on the 14th, it is easy to understand that he\r\nthought the steps now to be taken would lead to serious consequences. He\r\nalso foresaw that he might have trouble with some of the officers under\r\nhis command, for before leaving London he persuaded the Secretary of\r\nState and Sir John French to give the following permission: \"Officers\r\nactually domiciled in Ulster would be exempted from taking part in any\r\noperation that might take place. They would be permitted to 'disappear'\r\n[that being the exact phrase used by the War Office], and when all was\r\nover would be allowed to resume their places without their career or\r\nposition being affected.\"[68]\r\n\r\nHaving obtained this concession, Sir Arthur Paget returned the same\r\nnight to Dublin, where he arrived on the 20th and had a conference with\r\nhis general officers.\r\n\r\nHe told them of the instructions he had received, which the Government\r\ncalled \"precautionary\" and believed \"would be carried out without\r\nresistance.\" The Commander-in-Chief did not share the Government's\r\noptimism. He thought \"that the moves would create intense excitement,\"\r\nthat by next day \"the country would be ablaze,\" and that the result\r\nmight be \"active operations against organised bodies of the Ulster\r\nVolunteer Force under their responsible leaders.\" With regard to the\r\npermission for officers domiciled in Ulster to \"disappear,\" he informed\r\nhis generals that any other officers who were not prepared to carry out\r\ntheir duty would be dismissed the Service.\r\n\r\nThere was, apparently, some misunderstanding as to whether officers\r\nwithout an Ulster domicile who objected to fight against Ulster were to\r\nsay so at once and accept dismissal, or were to wait until they received\r\nsome specific order which they felt unable to obey. Many of the officers\r\nunderstood the General to mean the former of these two alternatives, and\r\nthe Colonel of one line regiment gave his officers half an hour to make\r\nup their minds on a question affecting their whole future career; every\r\none of them objected to going against Ulster, and \"nine or ten refused\r\nunder any condition\" to do so.[69] Another regimental commanding officer\r\ntold his subordinates that \"steps have been taken in Ulster so that any\r\naggression must come from the Ulsterites, and they will have to shed the\r\nfirst blood,\" on which his comment was: \"The idea of provoking Ulster is\r\nhellish.\"[70]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of what he learnt at the conference with his generals on\r\nthe morning of the 20th Sir Arthur Paget telegraphed to the War Office:\r\n\"Officer Commanding 5th Lancers states that all officers except two, and\r\none doubtful, are resigning their commissions to-day. I much fear same\r\nconditions in the 16th Lancers. Fear men will refuse to move[71]\"; and\r\nlater in the day he reported that the \"Brigadier and 57 officers, 3rd\r\nCavalry Brigade, prefer to accept dismissal if ordered north.\"[72] Next\r\nday he had to add that the Colonel and all the officers of the 4th\r\nHussars had taken up the same attitude.[73]\r\n\r\nThis was very disconcerting news for the War Office, where it had been\r\ntaken for granted that very few, if any, officers, except perhaps a few\r\nnatives of Ulster, would elect to wreck their careers, if suddenly\r\nconfronted with so terrible a choice, rather than take part in\r\noperations against the Ulster Loyalists. Instructions were immediately\r\nwired to Paget in Dublin to \"suspend any senior officers who have\r\ntendered their resignations\"; to refuse to accept the resignation of\r\njunior officers; and to send General Gough, the Brigadier in command of\r\nthe 3rd Cavalry Brigade, and the commanding officers of the two Lancer\r\nregiments and the 4th Hussars, to report themselves promptly at the War\r\nOffice after relieving them of their commands.\r\n\r\nHad the War Office made up its mind what to do with General Gough and\r\nthe other cavalry officers when they arrived in London? The inference to\r\nbe drawn from the correspondence published by the Government makes it\r\nappear probable that the first intention was to punish these officers\r\nseverely _pour encourager les autres_. An officer to replace Gough had\r\nactually been appointed and sent to Ireland, though Mr. Asquith denied\r\nin the House of Commons that the offending generals had been dismissed.\r\nBut, if that was the intention, it was abandoned. The reason is not\r\nplain; but the probability is that it had been discovered that sympathy\r\nwith Gough was widespread in the Army, and that his dismissal would\r\nbring about very numerous resignations. It was said that a large part of\r\nthe Staff of the War Office itself would have laid down their\r\ncommissions, and that Aldershot would have been denuded of officers.[74]\r\nColonel Seely himself described it as a \"situation of grave peril to the\r\nArmy.\"[75]\r\n\r\nAnyhow, no disciplinary action of any kind was taken. It was decided to\r\ntreat the matter as one of \"misunderstanding,\" and when Gough and his\r\nbrother officers appeared at the War Office on Monday the 23rd they were\r\ntold that it was all a mistake to suppose that the Government had ever\r\nintended warlike operations against Ulster (the orders to the fleet had\r\nbeen cancelled by wireless on the 21st), and that they might return at\r\nonce to their commands, with the assurance that they would not be\r\nrequired to serve against Ulster Loyalists. General Gough, who before\r\nleaving Ireland had asked Sir A. Paget for a clear definition in writing\r\nof the duties that officers would be expected to perform if they went to\r\nUlster,[76] thought that in view of the \"misunderstanding\" it would be\r\nwise to have Colonel Seely's assurance also in black and white. Seely\r\nhad to hurry off to a Cabinet Meeting, and in his absence the\r\nAdjutant-General reduced to writing the verbal statement of the\r\nSecretary of State. A very confused story about the subsequent fortunes\r\nof this piece of paper made it the central mystery round which raged\r\nangry debates. This much, however, is not doubtful. Seely went from the\r\nCabinet to Buckingham Palace; when he returned to Downing Street the\r\npaper was there, but the Cabinet had broken up. He looked at the paper,\r\nsaw that it did not accurately reproduce the assurance he had verbally\r\ngiven to Gough, and with the help of Lord Morley he thereupon added two\r\nparagraphs (which Mr. Balfour designated \"the peccant paragraphs\") to\r\nmake it conform to his promise. The addition so made was the only part\r\nof the document that gave the assurance that the officers would not be\r\ncalled upon \"to crush political opposition to the policy or principles\r\nof the Home Rule Bill.\" With this paper in his pocket General Gough\r\nreturned to his command at the Curragh.\r\n\r\nThere the matter might have ended had not some of the facts become\r\nknown to Unionist members of the House of Commons, and to the Press. On\r\nSunday, the 22nd, Mr. Asquith sent a communication to _The Times_\r\n(published on the 23rd) in which he minimised the whole matter, putting\r\nforward the original pretext of movements of troops solely to protect\r\nGovernment property--an account at variance with a statement two days\r\nlater by Churchill in regard to the reason for naval movements--and on\r\nthe 23rd Seely also made a statement in the House of Commons on the same\r\nlines as the Prime Minister's, which ended by saying that all the\r\nmovements of troops were completed \"and all orders issued have been\r\npunctually and implicitly obeyed.\" This was an hour or two after his\r\ninterview with the generals who had been summoned from Ireland to be\r\ndismissed for refusal to obey orders.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Bonar Law had his own information, which was much fuller than\r\nthe Government imagined. A long and heated debate followed Colonel\r\nSeely's statement, and was continued on the two following days,\r\ngradually dragging to light the facts with a much greater profusion of\r\ndetail than is necessary for this narrative. On the 24th Mr. L.S. Amery\r\nmade a speech which infuriated the Radicals and Labour members, but the\r\nspeaker, as was his intention, made them quite as angry with the\r\nGovernment as with himself. The cause of offence was that the Government\r\nwas thought to have allowed itself to be coerced by the soldiers, while\r\nthe latter had been allowed to make their obedience to orders contingent\r\non a bargain struck with the Government. This aspect of the case was\r\nforcibly argued by Mr. J. Ward, the Labour member for Stoke, in a speech\r\ngreatly admired by enthusiasts for \"democratic\" principles. Although Mr.\r\nWard's invective was mainly directed against the Unionist Opposition,\r\nthe latter listened to it with secret pleasure, perceiving that it was\r\nin reality more damaging to the Government than to themselves, since\r\nMinisters were forced into an attitude of defence against their own\r\nusually docile supporters. It may here be mentioned that at a much later\r\ndate, when Mr. John Ward, in the light of experience gained by his own\r\ndistinguished service as an officer in the Great War, had come to the\r\nconviction that \"the possibility of forcing Ulster within the ambit of a\r\nDublin Parliament has now become unthinkable,\" he acknowledged that in\r\n1914 the only way by which Mr. Asquith's Home Rule Act could have been\r\nenforced was through and by the power of the Army.[77]\r\n\r\nSo much shaken were the Government by these attacks that on the next\r\nday, the 25th of March, Colonel Seely, at the end of a long narrative of\r\nthe transaction, announced his resignation from the Government. He had,\r\nhe said, unintentionally misled his colleagues by adding without their\r\nknowledge to the paper given to General Gough; the Cabinet as a whole\r\nwas quite innocent of the great offence given to democratic sentiment.\r\nThis announcement having had the desired effect of relieving the\r\nMinistry as a whole from responsibility for the \"peccant paragraphs,\"\r\nand averting Radical wrath from their heads, the Prime Minister later in\r\nthe debate said he was not going to accept Seely's resignation. Yet Mr.\r\nChurchill exhibited a fine frenzy of indignation against Mr. Austen\r\nChamberlain for describing it as a \"put-up job.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a fairly fertile imagination could suggest a transaction to which\r\nthe phrase would be more justly applicable. The idea that Seely, in\r\nadding the paragraphs, was tampering in any way with the considered\r\npolicy of the Cabinet was absurd, although it served the purpose of\r\naverting a crisis in the House of Commons. He had been in constant and\r\nclose communication with Churchill, who had himself been present at the\r\nWar Office Conference with Gough, and who had seen the Prime Minister\r\nearlier in company with Sir John French. The whole business had been\r\ndiscussed at the Cabinet Meeting, and when Seely returned from his\r\naudience of the King he found the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, and\r\nLord Morley still in the Cabinet room. Mr. Asquith said on the 25th in\r\nthe House of Commons that no Minister except Seely had seen the added\r\nparagraphs, and almost at the same moment in the House of Lords Lord\r\nMorley was saying that he had helped Seely to draft them. Moreover,\r\nLord Morley actually took a copy of them, which he read in the House of\r\nLords, and he included the substance of them in his exposition of the\r\nGovernment policy in the Upper House.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, General Gough was on his way to Ireland that night, and if\r\nit had been true that the Prime Minister, or any other Minister,\r\ndisapproved of what Seely had done, there was no reason why Gough should\r\nnot have found a telegram waiting for him at the Curragh in the morning\r\ncancelling Seely's paragraphs and withdrawing the assurance they\r\ncontained. No step of that kind was taken, and the Government, while\r\nrepudiating in the House of Commons the action for which Seely was\r\nallowed to take the sole responsibility, permitted Gough to retain in\r\nhis despatch-box the document signed by the Army Council.\r\n\r\nFor it was not only the Secretary of State for War who was involved. The\r\nmemorandum had been written by the Adjutant-General, and it bore the\r\ninitials of Sir John French and Sir Spencer Ewart as well as Colonel\r\nSeely's. These members of the Army Council knew that the verbal\r\nassurance given by the Secretary of State to Gough had not been\r\ncompletely embodied in the written memorandum without the paragraph\r\nwhich had been repudiated after the debate in the Commons on the 24th,\r\nand they were not prepared to go back on their written word, or to be\r\nsatisfied by the \"put-up job\" resignation of their civilian Chief. They\r\nboth sent in their resignations; and, as they refused even under\r\npressure to withdraw them, the Secretary of State had no choice but to\r\ndo the same on the 30th of March, this time beyond recall. Mr. Asquith\r\nannounced on the same day that he had himself become Secretary of State\r\nfor War, and would have to go to Scotland for re-election.\r\n\r\nThe facts as here related were only extracted by the most persistent and\r\nlaborious cross-examination of the Government, who employed all the\r\nfamiliar arts of official evasion in order to conceal the truth from the\r\ncountry. Day after day Ministers were bombarded by batteries of\r\nquestions in the House of Commons, in addition to the lengthy debates\r\nthat occupied the House for several consecutive days. This pressure\r\ncompelled the Prime Minister to produce a White Paper, entitled\r\n\"Correspondence relating to Recent Events in the Irish Command.\"[78] It\r\nwas published on the 25th of March, the third day of the continuous\r\ndebates, and, although Mr. Asquith said it contained \"all the material\r\ndocuments,\" it was immediately apparent to members who had closely\r\nstudied the admissions that had been dragged from the Ministers chiefly\r\nconcerned, that it was very far from doing so. Much the most important\r\ndocuments had, in fact, been withheld. Suspicion as to the good faith of\r\nthe Government was increased when it was found that the Lord Chancellor,\r\nLord Haldane, had interpolated into the official Report of his speech in\r\nthe House of Lords a significant word which transformed his definite\r\npledge that Ulster would not be coerced, into a mere statement that no\r\n\"immediate\" coercion was contemplated.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such evasion and prevarication it was out of the question\r\nto let the matter drop. On the 22nd of April the Government was forced\r\nto publish a second White Paper,[79] which contained a large number of\r\nhighly important documents omitted from the first. But it was evident\r\nthat much was still being kept back, and, in particular, that what had\r\npassed between Sir Arthur Paget and his officers at a conference\r\nmentioned in the published correspondence was being carefully concealed.\r\nMr. Bonar Law demanded a judicial inquiry, where evidence could be taken\r\non oath. Mr. Asquith refused, saying that an insinuation against the\r\nhonour of Ministers could only be properly investigated by the House of\r\nCommons itself, and that a day would be given for a vote of censure if\r\nthe leader of the Opposition meant that he could not trust the word of\r\nMinisters of the Crown. Mr. Bonar Law sharply retorted that he \"had\r\nalready accused the Prime Minister of making a statement which was\r\nfalse.\"[80] But even this did not suffice to drive the Government to\r\nface the ordeal of having their own account of the affair at the Curragh\r\nsifted by the sworn evidence of others who knew the facts. They\r\npreferred to take cover under the dutiful cheers of their parliamentary\r\nmajority when they repeated their explanations, which had already been\r\nproved to be untrue.\r\n\r\nBut the Ulster Unionist Council had, meantime, been making inquiries on\r\ntheir own account. There was nothing in the least improper, although the\r\nsupporters of the Government tried to make out that there was, in the\r\nofficers at the Curragh revealing what the Commander-in-Chief had said\r\nto them, so long as they did not communicate anything to the Press. They\r\nwere not, and could not be, pledged to secrecy. It thus happened that it\r\nwas possible for the Old Town Hall in Belfast to put together a more\r\ncomplete account of the whole affair than it suited the Government to\r\nreveal to Parliament. On the 17th of April the Standing Committee issued\r\nto the Press a statement giving the main additional facts which a sworn\r\ninquiry would have elicited. It bore the signatures of Lord Londonderry\r\nand Sir Edward Carson, and there can have been few foolhardy enough to\r\nsuggest that these were men who would be likely to take such a step\r\nwithout first satisfying themselves as to the trustworthiness of the\r\nevidence, a point on which the judgment of one of them at all events was\r\nadmittedly unrivalled.\r\n\r\nFrom this statement it appeared that Sir Arthur Paget, so far from\r\nindicating that mere \"precautionary measures\" for the protection of\r\nGovernment stores were in contemplation, told his generals that\r\npreparations had been made for the employment of some 25,000 troops in\r\nUlster, in conjunction with naval operations. The gravity of the plan\r\nwas revealed by the General's use of the words \"battles\" and \"the\r\nenemy,\" and his statement that he would himself be \"in the firing line\"\r\nat the first \"battle.\" He said that, when some casualties had been\r\nsuffered by the troops, he intended to approach \"the enemy\" with a flag\r\nof truce and demand their surrender, and if this should be refused he\r\nwould order an assault on their position. The cavalry, whose pro-Ulster\r\nsentiments must have been well known to the Commander-in-Chief, were\r\ntold that they would only be required to prevent the infantry \"bumping\r\ninto the enemy,\" or in other words to act as a cavalry screen; that they\r\nwould not be called upon to fire on \"the enemy\"; and that as soon as\r\nthe infantry became engaged, they would be withdrawn and sent to Cork,\r\nwhere \"a disturbance would be arranged\" to provide a pretext for the\r\nmovement. A Military Governor of Belfast was to be appointed, and the\r\ngeneral purpose of the operations was to blockade Ulster by land and\r\nsea, and to provoke the Ulster men to shed the first blood.\r\n\r\nThe publication of this statement with the authority of the two Ulster\r\nleaders created a tremendous sensation. But it probably strengthened the\r\nresolution of the Government to refuse at all costs a judicial inquiry,\r\nwhich they knew would only supply sworn corroboration of the Ulster\r\nUnionist Council's story. In this they were assisted in an unexpected\r\nway. Just when the pressure was at its highest, relief came by the\r\ndiversion of attention and interest caused by another startling event in\r\nUlster, which will be described in the following chapters.\r\n\r\nThis Curragh Incident, which caused intense and prolonged excitement in\r\nMarch 1914, and nearly upset the Asquith Government, had more than\r\nmomentary importance in connection with the Ulster Movement. It proved\r\nto demonstration the intense sympathy with the loyalist cause that\r\npervaded the Army. That sympathy was not, as Radical politicians like\r\nMr. John Ward believed, an aristocratic sentiment only to be found in\r\nthe mess-rooms of smart cavalry regiments. It existed in all branches of\r\nthe Service, and among the rank and file as well as the commissioned\r\nranks. Sir Arthur Paget's telegram reporting to the War Office the\r\nfeeling in the 5th and 16th Lancers, said, \"Fear men will refuse to\r\nmove.\"[81] The men had not the same facility as the officers in making\r\ntheir sentiments known at headquarters, but their sympathies were the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThe Government had no excuse for being ignorant of this feeling in the\r\nArmy. It had been a matter of notoriety for a long time. Its existence\r\nand its danger had been reported by Lord Wolseley to the Duke of\r\nCambridge, back in the old days of Gladstonian Home Rule, in a letter\r\nthat had been since published. In July 1913 _The Times_ gave the\r\nwarning in a leading article that \"the crisis, the approach of which\r\nMinisters affect to treat with unconcern, is already causing uneasiness\r\nand apprehension in the public Services, and especially in the Army....\r\nIt is notorious that some officers have already begun to speak of\r\nsending in their papers.\" Lord Roberts had uttered a significant warning\r\nin the House of Lords not long before the incident at the Curragh.\r\nColonel Seely himself had been made aware of it in the previous December\r\nwhen he signed a War Office Memorandum on the subject[82]; and, indeed,\r\nno officer could fail to be aware of it who had ever been quartered in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nNor was it surprising that this sympathy should manifest itself. No one\r\nis quicker to appreciate the difference between loyalty and disloyalty\r\nthan the soldier. There were few regiments in the Army that had not\r\nlearnt by experience that the King's uniform was constantly insulted in\r\nNationalist Ireland, and as invariably welcomed and honoured in Ulster.\r\nIn the vote of censure debate on the 19th of March Mr. Cave quoted an\r\nIrish newspaper, which had described the British Army as \"the most\r\nimmoral and degraded force in Europe,\" and warned Irishmen that, by\r\njoining it, all they would get was \"a red coat, a dishonoured name, a\r\nbesmirched character.\" On the other hand, the very troops who were sent\r\nNorth from the Curragh against the advice of Sir Arthur Paget, to\r\nprovoke \"the Ulsterites to shed the first blood,\" had, as the\r\nCommander-in-Chief reported, \"everywhere a good reception.\"[83]\r\n\r\nThe welcoming cheers at Holywood and Carrickfergus and Armagh were\r\nprobably a pleasant novelty to men fresh from the Curragh or Fermoy.\r\nEven in Belfast itself the contrast was brought home to troops quartered\r\nin Victoria Barracks, all of whom were well aware that on the death of a\r\ncomrade his coffin would have to be borne by a roundabout route to the\r\ncemetery, to avoid the Nationalist quarter of the city where a military\r\nfuneral would be exposed to insult.\r\n\r\nSuch experiences, as they harden into traditions, sink deep into the\r\nconsciousness of an Army and breed sentiments that are not easily\r\neradicated. Soldiers ought, of course, to have no politics; but when it\r\nappeared that they might be called upon to open fire on those whom they\r\nhad always counted \"on our side,\" in order to subject them forcibly to\r\nmen who hated the sight of a British flag and were always ready to spit\r\nupon it, human nature asserted itself.

The\r\nexcitement of the Curragh Incident passed off without causing any sort\r\nof disturbance, and, as we have seen, the troops who were sent North\r\nreceived everywhere in Ulster a loyal welcome. This was a fine tribute\r\nto the discipline and restraint of the people, and was a further proof\r\nof their confidence in their leaders.\r\n\r\nThose leaders, it happened, were at that very moment taking measures to\r\nplace arms in the hands of the U.V.F. without robbing Government depots\r\nor any one else. That method was left to their opponents in Ireland at a\r\nlater date, who adopted it on an extensive scale accompanied by\r\nsystematic terrorism. The Ulster plan was quite different. All the arms\r\nthey obtained were paid for, and their only crime was that they\r\nsuccessfully hoodwinked Mr. Asquith's colleagues and agents.\r\n\r\nEvery movement has its Fabius, and also its Hotspur. Both are\r\nneeded--the men of prudence and caution, anxious to avoid extreme\r\ncourses, slow to commit themselves too far or to burn their boats with\r\nthe river behind them; and the impetuous spirits, who chafe at\r\nhalf-measures, cannot endure temporising, and are impatient for the\r\norder to advance against any odds. Major F.H. Crawford had more of the\r\ntemperament of a Hotspur than of a Fabius, but he nevertheless possessed\r\nqualities of patience, reticence, discretion, and coolness which\r\nenabled him to render invaluable service to the Ulster cause in an\r\nenterprise that would certainly have miscarried in the hands of a man\r\nendowed only with impetuosity and reckless courage. If the story of his\r\nadventures in procuring arms for the U.V.F. be ever told in minute\r\ndetail, it will present all the features of an exciting novel by Mr.\r\nJohn Buchan.\r\n\r\nFred Crawford, the man who followed a family tradition when he signed\r\nthe Covenant with his own blood,[84] began life as a premium apprentice\r\nin Harland and Wolf's great ship-building yard, after which he served\r\nfor a year as an engineer in the White Star Line, before settling down\r\nto his father's manufacturing business in Belfast. Like so many ardent\r\nLoyalists in Ulster, he came of Liberal stock. He was for years honorary\r\nSecretary of the Reform Club in Belfast. The more staid members of this\r\nhighly respectable establishment were not a little startled and\r\nperplexed when it was brought to their attention in 1907 that\r\nadvertisements in the name of one \"Hugh Matthews,\" giving the Belfast\r\nReform Club as his address, had appeared in a number of foreign\r\nnewspapers--French, Belgian, Italian, German, and Austrian--inquiring\r\nfor \"10,000 rifles and one million rounds of small-arm ammunition.\" The\r\nmembership of the Club included no Hugh Matthews; but inquiry showed\r\nthat the name covered the identity of the Hon. Secretary; and Crawford,\r\nwho sought no concealment in the matter, justified the advertisements by\r\npointing out that the Liberal Government which had lately come into\r\npower had begun its rule in Ireland by repealing the Act prohibiting the\r\nimportation of arms, and that there was therefore nothing illegal in\r\nwhat he was doing. But he resigned his secretaryship, which he felt\r\nmight hamper future transactions of the same kind. The advertisement was\r\nno doubt half bravado and half practical joke; he wanted to see whether\r\nit would attract notice, and if anything would come of it. But it had\r\nalso an element of serious purpose.\r\n\r\nCrawford regarded the advent to power of the Liberal Party as ominous,\r\nas indeed all Ulster did, for the Liberal Party was a Home Rule Party;\r\nand he had from his youth been convinced that the day would come when\r\nUlster would have to carry out Lord Randolph Churchill's injunction.\r\nThat being so, he was not the man to tarry till solemn assemblies of\r\nmerchants, lawyers, and divines should propound a policy; if there was\r\nto be fighting, Crawford was going to be ready for it, and thought that\r\npreparation for such a contingency could not begin too soon. And the\r\nadvertisements were not barren of practical result. There was an\r\nastonishing number of replies; Crawford purchased a few rifles, and\r\nobtained samples of others; and, what was more important, he gained\r\nknowledge of the Continental trade in second-hand firearms, which had\r\nits centre in the free port of Hamburg, and of the men engaged in that\r\ntrade. This knowledge he turned to account in 1912 and the two following\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHe had been for nearly twenty years an officer of Artillery Militia, and\r\nwhen the U.V.F. was organised in 1912 he became its Director of Ordnance\r\non the headquarters staff. He was also a member of the Standing\r\nCommittee of the Ulster Unionist Council, where he persistently\r\nadvocated preparation for armed resistance long before most of his\r\ncolleagues thought such a policy necessary. But early in 1912 he\r\nobtained leave to get samples of procurable firearms, and his\r\npromptitude in acting on it, and in presenting before certain members of\r\nthe Committee a collection of gleaming rifles with bayonets fixed, took\r\naway the breath of the more cautious of his colleagues.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward Crawford was frequently engaged in this business.\r\nHe got into communication with the dealers in arms whose acquaintance he\r\nhad made six years before. He went himself to Hamburg, and, after\r\nlearning something of the chicanery prevalent in the trade, which it\r\ntook all his resourcefulness to overcome, he fell in with an honest Jew\r\nby whose help he succeeded in sending a thousand rifles safely to\r\nBelfast. Other consignments followed from time to time in larger or\r\nsmaller quantities, in the transport of which all the devices of\r\nold-time smuggling were put to the test. Crawford bought a schooner,\r\nwhich for a year or more proved very useful, and, while employing her in\r\nbringing arms to Ulster, he made acquaintance with a skipper of one of\r\nthe Antrim Iron Ore Company's coasting steamers, whose name was Agnew, a\r\nfine seaman of the best type produced by the British Mercantile Marine,\r\nwho afterwards proved an invaluable ally, to whose loyalty and ability\r\nCrawford and Ulster owed a deep debt of gratitude, as they also did to\r\nMr. Robert Browne, Managing Director of the Antrim Iron Ore Company, for\r\nplacing at their disposal both vessels and seamen from time to time.\r\n\r\nNow and then the goods fell a victim to Custom House vigilance; for\r\nalthough there was at this time nothing illegal in importing firearms,\r\nit was not considered prudent to carry on the trade openly, which would\r\ncertainly have led to prohibition being introduced and enforced; and,\r\nconsequently, infringements of shipping regulations had to be risked,\r\nwhich gave the authorities the right to interfere if they discovered\r\nrifles where zinc plates or musical instruments ought to have been.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a case of arms was shipped on a small steamer from\r\nGlasgow to Portrush, but was not entered in the manifest, so that the\r\nskipper (being a worthy man) knew nothing--officially--of this box which\r\nlay on deck instead of descending into the hold. But two Customs\r\nofficials, who noticed it with unsatisfied curiosity, decided, just as\r\nthe boat cast off, to make the trip to Portrush. Happily it was a dirty\r\nnight, and they, being bad sailors, were constrained to take refuge from\r\nthe elements in the Captain's cabin. But when Portrush was reached\r\nsearch and research proved unavailing to find the mysterious box; the\r\nskipper could find no mention of it in the manifest and thought the\r\nCustoms House gentlemen must have been dreaming; they, on the other\r\nhand, threatened to seize the ship if the box did not materialise, and\r\nwere told to do so at their peril. But exactly off Ballycastle, which\r\nhad been passed while the officials were poorly, there was a float in\r\nthe sea attached to a line, which in due course led to the recovery of a\r\ncase of valuable property that was none the worse for a few hours' rest\r\non the bottom of the Moyle.\r\n\r\nQualities of a different sort were called into play in negotiating the\r\npurchase of machine-guns from Messrs. Vickers & Co., at Woolwich. Here a\r\nstrong American accent, combined with the providential circumstance that\r\nMexico happened to be in the grip of revolutionary civil war, overcame\r\nall difficulties, and Mr. John Washington Graham, U.S.A. (otherwise Fred\r\nH. Crawford of Belfast) played his part so effectively that he did not\r\nfail to finish the deal by extracting a handsome commission for himself,\r\nwhich found its way subsequently to the coffers of the Ulster Unionist\r\nCouncil. But he compensated the Company by making a suggestion for\r\nimproving the mechanism of the Maxim-gun which the great ordnance\r\nmanufacturers permanently adopted without having to pay for any patent\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nMajor Crawford was, however, by no means the only person who was at this\r\ntime bringing arms and ammunition into Ulster, which, as already\r\nexplained, although not illegal, could not be safely done openly on a\r\nlarge scale. Ammunition in small quantities dribbled into Belfast pretty\r\nconstantly, many amateur importers deriving pleasurable excitement from\r\nfeeling themselves conspirators, and affording amusement to others by\r\nthe tales told of the ingenious expedients resorted to by the smugglers.\r\n\r\nThere was a dock porter at Belfast, an intense admirer of Sir Edward\r\nCarson, who was the retailer of one of the best of these stories. He was\r\nalways on the look-out for the leader arriving by the Liverpool steamer,\r\nand would allow no one else, if he could help it, to handle the great\r\nman's hand-baggage; and when Carson was not a passenger, any of his\r\nsatellites who happened to be travelling came in for vicarious\r\nattention. Thus, it happened on one occasion that the writer, arriving\r\nalone from Liverpool, was hailed from the shore before the boat was made\r\nfast. \"Is Sir Edward on board?\" A shake of the head brought a look of\r\npathetic disappointment to the face of the hero-worshipper; but he was\r\non board before the gangway was down and busy collecting the belongings\r\nof the leader's unworthy substitute. When laden with these and half-way\r\ndown the gangway he stopped, and, entirely careless of the fact that he\r\nwas obstructing a number of passengers impatient to land, he turned and\r\nwhispered--a whisper that might be heard thirty yards off--with a\r\nknowing wink of the eye:\r\n\r\n\"We're getting in plenty of stuff now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" was the reply. \"Never mind about that now; put those things\r\non a car.\"\r\n\r\nBut he continued, without budging from the gangway, \"Och aye, we're\r\ngetting in plenty; but my God, didn't Mrs. Blank o' Dungannon bate all?\r\nDid ye hear about her?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I never heard of Mrs. Blank of Dungannon. But do hurry along, my\r\ngood man; you're keeping back all the passengers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! ye never heard o' Mrs. Blank o' Dungannon? Wait now till I tell\r\nye. Mrs. Blank came off this boat not a fortnight ago, an' as she came\r\ndown this gangway I declare to God you'd ha' swore she was within a week\r\nof her time--and divil a ha'porth the matter with her, only cartridges.\r\nAn' the fun was that the Custom House boys knowed rightly what it was,\r\nbut they dursn't lay a hand on her nor search her, for fear they were\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\nThis admiring tribute to the heroic matron of Dungannon--whose real name\r\nwas not concealed by the porter--was heard by a number of people, and\r\nprobably most of them thought themselves compensated by the story for\r\nthe delay it caused them in leaving the steamer.\r\n\r\nBy the summer of 1913 several thousands of rifles had been brought into\r\nUlster; but in May of that year the mishap occurred to which Lord\r\nRoberts referred in his letter to Colonel Hickman on the 4th of June,\r\nwhen he wrote: \"I am sorry to read about the capture of rifles.\"[85]\r\nCrawford had been obliged to find some place in London for storing the\r\narms which he was procuring from his friends in Hamburg, and with the\r\nhelp of Sir William Bull, M.P. for Hammersmith, the yard of an\r\nold-fashioned inn in that district was found where it was believed they\r\nwould be safe until means of transporting them to the North of Ireland\r\ncould be devised. The inn was taken by a firm calling itself John\r\nFerguson & Co., the active member of which was Sir William Bull's\r\nbrother-in-law, Captain Budden; and the business appeared to consist of\r\ndealing in second-hand scientific instruments and machinery,\r\ncuriosities, antique armour and weapons, old furniture, and so forth,\r\nwhich were brought in very heavy cases and deposited in the yard. For a\r\ntime it proved useful, and the Maxims from Woolwich passed safely\r\nthrough the Hammersmith store. But the London police got wind of the\r\nHammersmith Armoury, and seized a consignment of between six and seven\r\nthousand excellent Italian rifles. A rusty and little-known Act of\r\nParliament had to be dug up to provide legal authority for the seizure.\r\nMany sportsmen and others then learnt for the first time that, under the\r\nGun-barrel Proof Act, 1868, every gun-barrel in England must bear the\r\nGun-makers' Company's proof-mark showing that its strength has been\r\ntested and approved. As the penalty for being in possession of guns not\r\nso marked was a fine of £2 per barrel, to have put in a claim for the\r\nItalian rifles seized at Hammersmith would have involved a payment of\r\nmore than £12,000, and would have given the Government information as to\r\nthe channel through which they had been imported. No move was made,\r\ntherefore, so far as the firearms were concerned, but the bayonets\r\nattached to them, for the seizure of which there was no legal\r\njustification, were claimed by Crawford's agent in Hamburg, and\r\neventually reached Ulster safely by another route. About the same time a\r\nconsignment of half a million rounds of small-arm ammunition, which was\r\ndiscovered by the authorities through faulty packing in cement-bags, was\r\nalso confiscated in another part of the country.\r\n\r\nThese losses convinced Crawford that a complete change of method must be\r\nadopted if faith was to be kept with the Ulster Volunteers, who were\r\nimplicitly trusting their leaders to provide them with weapons to enable\r\nthem to make good the Covenant. More than a year before this time he had\r\ntold the special Committee dealing with arms, to which he was\r\nimmediately responsible, that, in his judgment, the only way of dealing\r\neffectively with the problem was not by getting small quantities\r\nsmuggled from time to time by various devices and through disguised\r\nordinary trade channels, but by bringing off a grand _coup_, as if\r\nrunning a blockade in time of war. He had crossed the Channel on purpose\r\nto submit this view to Sir Edward Carson and Captain Craig early in\r\n1912, but at that time nothing was done to give effect to it.\r\n\r\nBut the seizure of so large a number as six thousand rifles at a time\r\nwhen the political situation looked like moving towards a crisis in the\r\nnear future, made necessary a bolder attempt to procure the necessary\r\narms. When General Sir George Richardson took command of the U.V.F. in\r\nJuly 1913 he placed Captain (afterwards Lieut.-Colonel) Wilfrid Bliss\r\nSpender on his staff, and soon afterwards appointed him A.Q.M.G. of the\r\nForces. Captain Spender's duties comprised the supply of equipment,\r\narms, and ammunition, the organisation of transport, and the supervision\r\nof communications. He was now requested to confer with Major Fred\r\nCrawford with a view to preparing a scheme for procuring arms and\r\nammunition, to be submitted to a special sub-committee appointed to deal\r\nwith this matter, of which Captain James Craig was chairman. Spender\r\ngave his attention mainly to the difficulties that would attend the\r\nlanding and distribution of arms if they reached Ulster in safety;\r\nCrawford said he could undertake to purchase and bring them from a\r\nforeign port. Crawford's proposed _modus operandi_ may be given in his\r\nown words:\r\n\r\n     \"I would immediately go to Hamburg and see B.S. [the Hebrew dealer\r\n     in firearms with whom he had been in communication for some six or\r\n     seven years, and whom he had found perfectly honest, and not at all\r\n     grasping], and consult him as to what he had to offer. I would\r\n     purchase 25,000 to 30,000 rifles, modern weapons if possible, and\r\n     not the Italian Vetteli rifles we had been getting, all to take the\r\n     same ammunition and fitted with bayonets. I would purchase a\r\n     suitable steamer of 600 tons in some foreign port and load her up\r\n     with the arms, and either bring her in direct or transfer the cargo\r\n     to a local steamer in some estuary or bay on the Scottish coast. I\r\n     felt confident, though I knew the difficulties in front of me,\r\n     that I could carry it through all right.\"[86]\r\n\r\nThe sub-committee accepted Crawford's proposal, and, when it had been\r\nconfirmed by Headquarters Council, he was commissioned to go to Hamburg\r\nto see how the land lay. On arriving there he found that B.S. had still\r\nin store ten thousand Vetteli rifles and a million rounds of ammunition\r\nfor them, which he had been holding for Crawford for two years. After a\r\nday or two the dealer laid three alternative proposals before his Ulster\r\ncustomer: (a) Twenty thousand Vetteli rifles, with bayonets (ammunition\r\nwould have to be specially manufactured).(6) Thirty thousand Russian\r\nrifles with bayonets (lacking scabbards) and ammunition, (c) Fifteen\r\nthousand new Austrian, and five thousand German army rifles with\r\nbayonets, both to take standard Mannlicher cartridges.\r\n\r\nThe last mentioned of these alternatives was much the most costly, being\r\ndouble the price of the first and nearly treble that of the second; but\r\nit had great advantages over the other two. Ammunition for the Italian\r\nweapons was only manufactured in Italy, and, if further supplies should\r\nbe required, could only be got from that country. The Russian rifles\r\nwere perfectly new and unused, but were of an obsolete pattern; they\r\nwere single-loaders, and fresh supplies of cartridges would be nearly as\r\ndifficult to procure for them as for the Italian. The Austrian and\r\nGerman patterns were both first-rate; the rifles were up-to-date\r\nclip-loaders, and, what was the most important consideration, ammunition\r\nfor them would be easily procurable in the United Kingdom or from\r\nAmerica or Canada.\r\n\r\nBut the difference in cost was so great that Crawford returned to\r\nBelfast to explain matters to his Committee, calling in London on his\r\nway to inform Carson and Craig. He strongly urged the acceptance of the\r\nthird alternative offer, laying stress, among other considerations, on\r\nthe moral effect on men who knew they had in their hands the most modern\r\nweapon with all latest improvements. Carson was content to be guided on\r\na technical matter of this sort by the judgment of a man whom he knew\r\nto be an expert, and as James Craig, who was in control of the fund\r\near-marked for the purchase of arms, also agreed, Crawford had not much\r\ndifficulty in persuading the Committee when he reached Belfast, although\r\nat first they were rather staggered by the difference in cost between\r\nthe various proposals.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the beginning of February 1914 that Crawford returned\r\nto Hamburg to accept this offer, and to make arrangements with B.S. for\r\ncarrying out the rest of his scheme for transporting his precious but\r\ndangerous cargo to Ulster. On his way through London he called again on\r\nCarson.\r\n\r\n     \"I pointed out to Sir Edward, my dear old Chief,\" says Crawford in\r\n     a written account of the interview, \"that some of my Committee had\r\n     no idea of the seriousness of the undertaking, and, when they did\r\n     realise what they were in for, might want to back out of it. I\r\n     said, 'Once I cross this time to Hamburg there is no turning back\r\n     with me, no matter what the circumstances are so far as my personal\r\n     safety is concerned; and no contrary orders from the Committee to\r\n     cancel what they have agreed to with me will I obey. I shall carry\r\n     out the _coup_ if I lose my life in the attempt. Now, Sir Edward,\r\n     you know what I am about to undertake, and the risks those who back\r\n     me up must run. Are you willing to back me to the finish in this\r\n     undertaking? If you are not, I don't go. But, if you are, I would\r\n     go even if I knew I should not return; it is for Ulster and her\r\n     freedom I am working, and this alone.' I so well remember that\r\n     scene. We were alone; Sir Edward was sitting opposite to me. When I\r\n     had finished, his face was stern and grim, and there was a glint in\r\n     his eye. He rose to his full height, looking me in the eye; he\r\n     advanced to where I was sitting and stared down at me, and shook\r\n     his clenched fist in my face, and said in a steady, determined\r\n     voice, which thrilled me and which I shall never forget: 'Crawford,\r\n     I'll see you through this business, if I should have to go to\r\n     prison for it.' I rose from my chair; I held out my hand and said,\r\n     'Sir Edward, that is all I want. I leave to-night; good-bye.'\"\r\n\r\nNext day Crawford was in Hamburg. He immediately concluded his\r\nagreement with B.S., and began making arrangements for carrying out the\r\nplan he had outlined to the Committee in Belfast. As will be seen in the\r\nnext chapter, he was actually in the middle of this adventure at the\r\nvery time when Seely and Churchill were worrying lest \"evil-disposed\r\npersons\" should raid and rob the scantily stocked Government Stores at\r\nOmagh and Enniskillen.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[84] _Ante_, p. 123.\r\n\r\n[85] _Ante_, p. 161.\r\n\r\n[86] From a manuscript narrative by Colonel F.H. Crawford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA VOYAGE OF ADVENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Lloyd George's message to mankind on New Year's Day, 1914,\r\nwas that \"Anglo-German relations were far more friendly than for years\r\npast,\"[87] and that there was therefore no need to strengthen the\r\nBritish Navy, it may be doubted, with the knowledge we now possess,\r\nwhether the German Government would have been greatly incensed at the\r\nidea of a cargo of firearms finding its way from Hamburg to Ireland in\r\nthe spring of that year without the knowledge of the British Government.\r\nBut if that were the case Fred Crawford had no reason to suspect it.\r\nGerman surveillance was always both efficient and obtrusive, and he had\r\nto make his preparations under a vigilance by the authorities which\r\nshowed no signs of laxity. Those preparations involved the assembling\r\nand the packing of 20,000 modern rifles, 15,000 of which had to be\r\nbrought from a factory in Austria; 10,000 Italian rifles previously\r\npurchased, which B.S. had in store; bayonets for all the firearms; and\r\nupwards of 3,000,000 rounds of small-arm ammunition. The packing of the\r\narms was a matter to which Crawford gave particular attention. He kept\r\nin mind the circumstances under which he expected them to be landed in\r\nUlster. Avoidance of confusion and rapidity of handling were of the\r\nfirst importance. Rifles, bayonets, and ammunition must be not separated\r\nin bulk, requiring to be laboriously reassembled at their destination.\r\nHe therefore insisted that parcels should be made up containing five\r\nrifles in each, with bayonets to match, and 100 rounds of ammunition per\r\nrifle, each parcel weighing about 75 lbs. He attached so much importance\r\nto this system of packing that he adhered to it even after discovering\r\nthat it would cost about £2,000, and would take more than a month to\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nWhile the work of packing was going on, Crawford, who found he was\r\nexciting the curiosity of the Hamburg police, kept out of sight as much\r\nas possible, and he paid more than one visit to the Committee in\r\nBelfast, leaving the supervision to the skipper and packer, whom he had\r\nfound he could trust. In the meantime, by advertisements in the\r\nScandinavian countries, he was looking out for a suitable steamer to\r\ncarry the cargo. For a crew his thoughts turned to his old friend,\r\nAndrew Agnew, skipper in the employment of the Antrim Iron Ore Company.\r\nHappily he was not only able to secure the services of Agnew himself,\r\nbut Agnew brought with him his mate and his chief and second engineers.\r\nThis was a great gain; for they were not only splendid men at their job,\r\nbut were men willing to risk their liberty or their lives for the Ulster\r\ncause. Deck-hands and firemen would be procurable at whatever port a\r\nsteamer was to be bought.\r\n\r\nSeveral vessels were offered in response to Crawford's advertisements,\r\nand on the 16th of March, when the packing of the arms was well\r\nadvanced, Crawford, Agnew, and his chief engineer went to Norway to\r\ninspect these steamers. Eventually they selected the s.s. _Fanny_, which\r\nhad just returned to Bergen with a cargo of coal from Newcastle. She was\r\nonly an eight-knot vessel, but her skipper, a Norwegian, gave a\r\nfavourable report of her sea-going qualities and coal consumption, and\r\nAgnew and his engineer were satisfied by their inspection of her. The\r\ndeal was quickly completed, and the Captain and his Norwegian crew\r\nwillingly consented to remain in charge of the _Fanny_; and, in order to\r\nenable her to sail under the Norwegian flag, as a precaution against\r\npossible confiscation in British waters, it was arranged that the\r\nCaptain should be the nominal purchaser, giving Crawford a mortgage for\r\nher full value.\r\n\r\nThen, leaving Agnew to get sufficient stores on board the _Fanny_ for a\r\nthree-months' cruise, Crawford returned to Hamburg on the 20th, and\r\nthence to Belfast to report progress. Agnew's orders were to bring the\r\n_Fanny_ in three weeks' time to a rendezvous marked on the chart\r\nbetween the Danish islands of Langeland and Fünen, where he was to pick\r\nup the cargo of arms, which Crawford would bring in lighters from\r\nHamburg through the Kiel Canal.\r\n\r\nWhile Crawford was in Belfast arrangements were made to enable him to\r\nkeep in communication with Spender, so that in case of necessity he\r\ncould be warned not to approach the Irish coast, but to cruise in the\r\nBaltic till a more favourable opportunity. He was to let Spender know\r\nlater where he could be reached with final instructions as to landing\r\nthe arms; the rendezvous so agreed upon subsequently was Lough Laxford,\r\na wild and inaccessible spot on the west coast of Sutherlandshire.\r\nCrawford was warned by B.S. that he was far from confident of a\r\nsuccessful end to their labours at Hamburg. He had never before shipped\r\nanything like so large a number of firearms; and the long process of\r\npacking, and Crawford's own mysterious coming and going, would be\r\ncertain to excite suspicion, which would reach the secret agents of the\r\nBritish Government, and lead either to a protest addressed to the German\r\nauthorities, followed by a prohibition on shipping the arms, or to\r\nconfiscation by the British authorities when the cargo entered British\r\nterritorial waters.\r\n\r\nThese fears must have been present to the mind of B.S. when he met\r\nCrawford at the station in Hamburg on the 27th on his return from\r\nBelfast, for the precautions taken to avoid being followed gave their\r\nmovements the character of an adventure by one of Stanley Weyman's\r\nheroes of romance. Whether any suspicion had in fact been aroused\r\nremains unknown. Anyhow, the barges were ready laden, with a tug waiting\r\ntill the tide should serve about midnight for making a start down the\r\nElbe, and through the canal to Kiel. The modest sum of £10 procured an\r\norder authorising the tug and barges to proceed through the canal\r\nwithout stopping, and requiring other shipping to let them pass. A black\r\nflag was the signal of this privileged position, which suggested the\r\n\"Jolly Roger\" to Crawford's thoughts, and gave a sense of insolent\r\naudacity when great liners of ten or fifteen thousand tons were seen\r\nmaking way for a tug-boat towing a couple of lighters.\r\n\r\nFor the success of the enterprise up to this point Crawford was greatly\r\nindebted to the Jew, B.S. From first to last this gentleman \"played the\r\ngame\" with sterling honesty and straightforward dealing that won his\r\ncustomers' warm admiration. Several times he accepted Crawford's word as\r\nsufficient security when cash was not immediately forthcoming, and in no\r\ninstance did he bear out the character traditionally attributed to his\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Kiel, Crawford, after a short absence from the tug, was\r\ninformed that three men had been inquiring from the lightermen and the\r\ntug's skipper about the nature and destination of the cargo. All such\r\nevidences of curiosity on the subject were rather alarming, but it\r\nturned out that the visitors were probably Mexicans--of what political\r\nparty there it would be impossible to guess--whose interest had been\r\naroused by the rumour, which Crawford had encouraged, that guns were\r\nbeing shipped to that distracted Republic. Still more alarming was the\r\narrival on board the tug of a German official in resplendent uniform,\r\nwho insisted that he must inspect the cargo. Crawford knew no German,\r\nbut the shipping agent who accompanied him produced papers showing that\r\nall formalities had been complied with, and all requisite authorisation\r\nobtained. Neither official papers, however, nor arguments made any\r\nimpression on the officer until it occurred to Crawford to produce a\r\n100-marks note, which proved much more persuasive, and sent the official\r\non his way rejoicing, with expressions of civility on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe relief of the Ulsterman when the last of the Kiel forts was left\r\nbehind, and he knew that his cargo was clear of Germany, may be\r\nimagined. A night was spent crossing Kiel Bay, and in the morning of the\r\n29th they were close to Langeland, and approaching the rendezvous with\r\nthe _Fanny_. She was there waiting, and Agnew, in obedience to orders,\r\nhad already painted out her name on bows and stern. The next thing was\r\nto transfer the arms from the lighters to the _Fanny_. Crawford was\r\napprehensive lest the Danish authorities should take an interest in the\r\nproceedings if the work was carried out in the narrow channel between\r\nthe islands, and he proposed, as it was quite calm, to defer operations\r\ntill they were further from the shore. But the Norwegian Captain\r\ndeclared that he had often transhipped cargo at this spot, and that\r\nthere was no danger whatever. Nevertheless, Crawford's fears were\r\nrealised. Before the work was half finished a Danish Port Officer came\r\non board, asked what the cargo comprised, and demanded to see the ship's\r\npapers. According to the manifest the _Fanny_ was bound for Iceland with\r\na general cargo, part of which was to be shipped at Bergen. The Danish\r\nofficer then spent half an hour examining the bales, and, although he\r\ndid not open any of them, Crawford felt no doubt he knew perfectly the\r\nnature of their contents. Finally he insisted on carrying off the\r\npapers, both of the _Fanny_ and the tug-boat, saying that all the\r\ninformation must be forwarded to Copenhagen to be dealt with by the\r\nGovernment authorities, but that the papers would be returned early next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nOne can well believe Crawford when he says that he suffered \"mental\r\nagony\" that night. After all that he had planned, and all that he had\r\naccomplished by many months of personal energy and resource, he saw\r\ncomplete and ignominious failure staring him in the face. He realised\r\nthe heavy financial loss to the Ulster Loyalists, for his cargo\r\nrepresented about £70,000 of their money; and he realised the bitter\r\ndisappointment of their hopes, which was far worse than any loss of\r\nmoney. He pictured to himself what must happen in the morning--\"to have\r\nto follow a torpedo-boat into the naval base and lie there till the\r\nwhole Ulster scheme was unravelled and known to the world as a ghastly\r\nfailure, and the Province and Sir Edward and all the leaders the\r\nlaughing stock of the world\"--and the thought of it all plunged him\r\nalmost into despair.\r\n\r\nAlmost, but not quite. He was not the man to give way to despair. If it\r\ncame to the worst he would \"put all the foreign crew and their\r\nbelongings into the boats and send them off; Agnew and I would arm\r\nourselves with a bundle of rifles, and cut it open and have 500 rounds\r\nto fight any attempt to board us, and if we slipped this by any chance,\r\nhe and I would bring her to England together, he on deck and I in the\r\nengine-room. He knew all about navigation and I knew all about engines,\r\nhaving been a marine engineer in my youth.\"\r\n\r\nBut a less desperate job called for immediate attention. The men engaged\r\nin transferring the cargo from the barges to the steamer wanted to knock\r\noff work for the night; but the offer of double pay persuaded them to\r\nstick to it, and they worked with such good will that by midnight every\r\nbale was safely below hatches in the _Fanny_. Crawford then instructed\r\nthe shipping agent to be off in the tug at break of day, giving him\r\nletters to post which would apprise the Committee in Belfast of what had\r\nhappened, and give them the means of communicating with himself\r\naccording to previously concerted plans.\r\n\r\nBefore morning a change occurred in the weather, which Crawford regarded\r\nas providential. He was gladdened by the sight of a sea churned white by\r\nhalf a gale, while a mist lay on the water, reducing visibility to about\r\n300 yards. It would be impossible for the Port Officer's motor-boat to\r\nface such a sea, or, if it did, to find the _Fanny_, unless guided by\r\nher fog-whistle. As soon as eight o'clock had passed--the hour by which\r\nthe return of the ship's papers had been promised--Crawford weighed\r\nanchor, and crept out of the narrow channel under cover of the fog, only\r\nnarrowly escaping going aground on the way among the banks and shallows\r\nthat made it impossible to sail before daylight, but eventually the open\r\nsea was safely reached. But the _Fanny_ was now without papers, and in\r\nlaw was a pirate ship. It was therefore desirable for her to change her\r\ncostume. As many hands as possible were turned to the task of giving a\r\nnew colour to the funnel and making some other effective alterations in\r\nher appearance, including a new name on her bows and stern. Thus\r\nrenovated, and after a delay of some days, caused by trifling mishaps,\r\nshe left the Cattegat behind and steered a course for British waters.\r\n\r\nThe original plan had been to set a course for Iceland, and, when north\r\nof the Shetlands, to turn to the southward to Lough Laxford, the agreed\r\nrendezvous with Spender. But the incident at Langeland, which had made\r\nthe Danish authorities suspect illegal traffic with Iceland, made a\r\nchange of plan imperative. Before leaving Danish waters Crawford tried\r\nto communicate this change to Belfast. But, meantime, information had\r\nreached Belfast of certain measures being taken by the Government, and\r\nSpender, hoping to catch Crawford before he left Kiel, went to Dublin to\r\ntelegraph from there. In Dublin he was dismayed to read in the\r\nnewspapers that a mysterious vessel called the _Fanny_, said to be\r\ncarrying arms for Ulster, had been captured by the Danish authorities in\r\nthe Baltic. For several days no further news reached Belfast, where it\r\nwas assumed that the whole enterprise had failed; and then a code\r\nmessage informed the Committee that Crawford was in London.\r\n\r\nSpender at once went over to see him, in order to warn him not to bring\r\nthe arms to Ireland for the present. He was to take them back to\r\nHamburg, or throw them overboard, or sink the _Fanny_ and take to her\r\nboats, according to circumstances. But in London, instead of Crawford,\r\nSpender found the Hamburg skipper and packer, who told him of Crawford's\r\nescape from Langeland with the loss of the ship's papers. Spender,\r\nknowing nothing of Crawford's change of plan, and anxious to convey to\r\nhim the latest instructions, went off on a wild-goose chase to the\r\nHighlands of Scotland, where he spent the best part of an unhappy week\r\nwatching the waves tumbling in Lough Laxford, and looking as anxiously\r\nas Tristan for the expected ship.\r\n\r\nMeantime the _Fanny_ had crossed the North Sea, and Crawford sent Agnew\r\nashore at Yarmouth on the 7th of April with orders to hurry to Belfast,\r\nwhere he was to procure another steamer and bring it to a rendezvous at\r\nLundy Island, in the Bristol Channel. Crawford himself, having\r\nrechristened the _Fanny_ for the second time (this time the _Doreen_),\r\nproceeded down the English Channel, where he had a rather adventurous\r\ncruise in a gale of wind. He kept close to the French coast, to avoid\r\nany unwelcome attentions in British waters, but on the way had an attack\r\nof malaria, which the Captain thought so grave that, no doubt with the\r\nmost humane motives, he declared his intention of putting Crawford\r\nashore at Dunkirk to save his life, a design which no persuasion short\r\nof Crawford's handling of his revolver in true pirate fashion would make\r\nthe Norwegian abandon.\r\n\r\nIn the heavy seas of the Channel the _Doreen_ could not make more than\r\nfour knots, and she was consequently twenty-four hours late for the\r\nrendezvous with Agnew at Lundy, where she arrived on the 11th of April.\r\nThe Bristol Channel seemed to swarm with pilot boats eager to be of\r\nservice, whose inquisitive and expert eyes were anything but welcome to\r\nthe custodian of Ulster's rifles; and to his highly strung imagination\r\nevery movement of every trawler appeared to betoken suspicion. And,\r\nindeed, they were not without excuse for curiosity; for, a foreign\r\nsteamer whose course seemed indeterminate, now making for Cardiff and\r\nnow for St. Ives, observed at one time north-east of Lundy and a few\r\nhours later south of the island--a tramp, in fact, that was obviously\r\n\"loitering\" with no ascertainable destination, was enough to keep\r\ntelescopes to the eyes of Devon pilots and fisher-folk, and to set their\r\ntongues wagging. But there was no help for it. Crawford could not leave\r\nthe rendezvous till Agnew arrived, and was forced to wander round Lundy\r\nand up and down the Bristol Channel for two days and nights, until, at 5\r\na.m. on Monday morning, the 13th of April, a signal from a passing\r\nsteamer, the _Balmerino_, gave the welcome tidings that Agnew was on\r\nboard and was proceeding to sea.\r\n\r\nWhen the two steamers were sufficiently far from Lundy lighthouse and\r\nother prying eyes to make friendly intercourse safe, Agnew came on board\r\nthe _Doreen_, bringing with him another North Irish seaman whom he\r\nintroduced to Crawford. This man handed to Crawford a paper he had\r\nbrought from Belfast. It was typewritten; it bore no address and no\r\nsignature; it was no doubt a duplicate of what Spender had taken to the\r\nHighlands, for its purport, as given by Crawford from memory, was to the\r\nfollowing effect: \"Owing to great changes since you left, and altered\r\ncircumstances, the Committee think it would be unwise to bring the\r\ncargo here at present, and instruct you to proceed to the Baltic and\r\ncruise there for three months, keeping in touch with the Committee, or\r\nelse to store the goods at Hamburg till required.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"great changes\" referred to were the operations that led to the\r\nCurragh incident, the story of which Crawford now learnt from Agnew. The\r\npresence of the fleet at Lamlash, and of destroyers off Carrickfergus,\r\nwas enough to make the Committee deem it an inopportune moment for\r\nCrawford to bring his goods to Belfast Lough. But the latter was hardly\r\nin a condition to appreciate the gravity of the situation, and the\r\nindignation which the missive aroused in him is intelligible. After all\r\nhe had come through, the ups and downs, dangers and escapes--far more\r\nvaried than have been here recorded--the disappointment at being ordered\r\nback was cruel; and in his eyes such instructions were despicably\r\npusillanimous. The caution that had prompted his instructors to leave\r\nthe order unsigned moved him to contempt, and in his wrath he was\r\nconfident that \"the Chief at any rate had nothing to do with it.\" He\r\ntold the messenger that he did not know who had sent the paper, and did\r\nnot want to know, and instructed him to take it back and inform the\r\nsenders that, as it bore no signature, no date, no address, and no\r\nofficial stamp, he declined to recognise it and refused to obey it; and,\r\nfurther, that unless he received within six days properly authenticated\r\ninstructions for delivering his cargo, he would run his ship ashore at\r\nhigh water in the County Down, and let the Ulstermen salve as much as\r\nthey could when the tide ebbed.\r\n\r\nBut Crawford determined to make another effort first to accomplish his\r\ntask by less desperate methods. He therefore decided to accompany the\r\nmessenger back to Belfast. The _Doreen_, late _Fanny_, was too\r\nforeign-looking to pass unchallenged up Belfast Lough, but he believed\r\nthat if the cargo could be transhipped to a vessel known to all watchers\r\non the North Irish coast, a policy of audacity would have a good chance\r\nof success. The s.s. _Balmerino_, which had brought Agnew and the\r\nmessenger to Lundy, was such a vessel; her owner, Mr. Sam Kelly, was an\r\nintimate friend of Crawford's; and if he could see Kelly the matter, he\r\nhoped, might be quickly arranged. The reliance which Crawford placed in\r\nMr. Sam Kelly was fully justified, for the assistance rendered by this\r\ngentleman was essential to the success of the enterprise. He it was who\r\nfreely supplied two steamers, with crews and stevedores, thereby\r\nenabling the last part of this adventurous voyage to be carried through;\r\nand the willingness with which Mr. Kelly risked financial loss, and much\r\nbesides, placed Ulster under an obligation to him for which he sought no\r\nrecompense.\r\n\r\nCrawford accordingly went off in the _Balmerino_, landed in South Wales\r\non Tuesday, the 14th of April, and hastened by the quickest route to\r\nBelfast. Agnew took charge of the _Doreen_, with instructions to be at\r\nthe Tuskar Light, on the Wexford coast, on the following Friday night,\r\nthe 17th, and to return there every night until Crawford rejoined him. A\r\nfriend of Crawford's, Mr. Richard Cowser, with whom he had a\r\nconversation on the telephone from Dublin, met him at the railway\r\nstation in Belfast and told him that he had a motor waiting to take him\r\nto Craigavon, where the Council was expecting him, and that he would see\r\nMr. Sam Kelly, the owner of the _Balmerino_, there also. This news made\r\nCrawford very angry. He accused his friend of breach of confidence in\r\nletting anyone know that he was coming to Belfast; he declared he would\r\nhave nothing to do with the Council after the unsigned orders he had\r\nreceived at Lundy; and he besought his friend to take his car to\r\nCraigavon and bring back Kelly, repeating his determination to bring in\r\nhis cargo, even if he had to run his ship ashore to do so. Mr. Cowser\r\nreplied that this would be very disappointing to Sir Edward Carson, who\r\nwas waiting for Crawford at Craigavon, having come from London on\r\npurpose for this Council Meeting. \"What!\" exclaimed Crawford, \"is Sir\r\nEdward there? Why did you not say so at once? Where is your car? Let us\r\nwaste no time till I see the Chief and report to him.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening of the 14th of April, at Craigavon, was a memorable one for\r\nall who were present at the meeting. Carson invited Crawford to relate\r\nall he had done, and to explain how he proposed to proceed. The latter\r\ndid not mince matters in saying what he thought of the Lundy\r\ninstructions, which he again declared angrily he intended to disobey.\r\nWhen he had finished his narrative and his protestations against what he\r\nconsidered a cowardly policy--a policy that would deprive Ulster of\r\nsuccour as sorely needed as Derry needed the _Mountjoy_ to break the\r\nboom--Carson put a few questions to him in regard to the feasibility of\r\nhis plans. Crawford explained the advantage it would be to transfer the\r\ncargo from the _Fanny_ to a local steamer, which he felt confident he\r\ncould bring into Larne, and after the transhipment he would send the\r\n_Fanny_ straight back to the Baltic, where she could settle her account\r\nwith the Danish authorities and recover her papers.\r\n\r\nSome members of the Council were sceptical about the possibility of\r\ntranshipping the cargo at sea, but Crawford, who had fully discussed it\r\nwith Agnew, believed that if favoured by calm weather it could be done.\r\nWhen Carson, after hearing all that was to be said on both sides in the\r\nlong debate between Fabius and Hotspur, finally supported the latter,\r\nthe question was decided. There was no split--there never was in these\r\ndeliberations in Ulster; those whose judgment was overruled always\r\nsupported loyally the policy decided upon.\r\n\r\nImmediate measures were then taken to give effect to the decision. Kelly\r\nknew of a suitable craft, the s.s. _Clydevalley_, for sale at that\r\nmoment in Glasgow, which would be in Belfast next morning with a cargo\r\nof coal. This was providential. A collier familiar to every longshoreman\r\nin Belfast Lough, carrying on her usual trade this week, could hardly be\r\nsuspected of carrying rifles when she returned next week ostensibly in\r\nthe same line of business. It was settled that Crawford should cross to\r\nGlasgow at once and buy her; the steamer, when bought, was to go from\r\nBelfast to Llandudno, where she would pick up Crawford on the sands, and\r\nproceed to keep the rendezvous with Agnew at the Tuskar Light on Friday;\r\nand, after taking over the _Fanny's_ cargo, would then steam boldly up\r\nBelfast Lough and through the Musgrave Channel to the Belfast docks,\r\nwhere he undertook to arrive on the Friday week, the 24th of April, the\r\nvarious proposals which named Larne, Bangor, and Donaghadee as ports of\r\ndischarge having all been rejected after full discussion. This last\r\ndecision was not approved by Crawford, for he and Spender had long\r\nbefore this time agreed that Larne harbour was the proper place to land\r\nthe arms, both because the large number of country roads leading to it\r\nwould facilitate rapid distribution, and because it would be more\r\ndifficult for the authorities to interfere with the disembarkation there\r\nthan at any of the other ports.\r\n\r\nBefore parting from the Council Crawford made it quite clear that during\r\nthe remainder of the adventure he would recognise no orders of any kind\r\nunless they bore the autograph signature of Sir Edward Carson. On this\r\nunderstanding he set out for Glasgow, bought the _Clydevalley_, and went\r\nby train to Llandudno to await her arrival. These affairs had left very\r\nlittle margin of time to spare. The _Clydevalley_ could not be at\r\nLlandudno before the morning of the 17th, and Agnew would be looking for\r\nher at the Tuskar the same evening. As it actually turned out she only\r\narrived at the Welsh watering-place late that night, and, after picking\r\nup Crawford, who had spent an anxious day on the beach, arrived off the\r\nWexford coast at daybreak on Saturday, the 18th. Not a sign of the\r\n_Fanny_ was to be seen all that day, or the following night; and when\r\nthe skipper of the _Clydevalley_, who had been on the _Balmerino_ and\r\nwas privy to the arrangements with Agnew, gave Crawford reason to think\r\nthere might have been a misunderstanding as to the rendezvous, Yarmouth\r\nhaving been also mentioned in that connection, Crawford was in a\r\ncondition almost of desperation.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a situation to test the nerves, to say nothing of the\r\ntemper, of even the most resolute. It was Sunday, and Crawford had\r\nundertaken to be at Copeland Island, at the mouth of Belfast Lough, on\r\nFriday evening for final landing instructions. The precious cargo, which\r\nhad passed safely through so many hazards, had vanished and was he knew\r\nnot where. He had heard nothing of the _Fanny_ (or _Doreen_) since he\r\nlanded at Tenby five days previously. Had she been captured by a\r\ndestroyer from Pembroke, or overhauled, pirate as she was without\r\npapers, by Customs officials from Rosslare? Or had Agnew mistaken his\r\ninstructions, and risked all the dangers of the English Channel in a\r\nfruitless voyage to Yarmouth, where, even if still undetected, the\r\n_Fanny_ would be too far away to reach Copeland by Friday, unless Agnew\r\ncould be communicated with at once?\r\n\r\nThere was only one way in which such communication could be managed, and\r\nthat way Crawford now took with characteristic promptitude and energy.\r\nThe _Clydevalley_ crossed the Irish Sea to Fishguard, where he took\r\ntrain on Sunday night to London and Yarmouth, having first made\r\narrangements with the skipper for keeping in touch. But there was no\r\ntrace of the _Fanny_ at Yarmouth, and no word from Agnew at the Post\r\nOffice. There appeared to be no solution of the problem, and every\r\nprecious hour that slipped away made ultimate failure more menacing. But\r\nat two o'clock the outlook entirely changed. A second visit to the Post\r\nOffice was rewarded by a telegram in code from Agnew saying all was\r\nwell, and that he would be at Holyhead to pick up Crawford on Tuesday\r\nevening. There was just time to catch a London train that arrived in\r\ntime for the Irish mail from Euston. On Tuesday morning Crawford was\r\npacing the breakwater at Holyhead, and a few hours later he was\r\ndiscussing matters with Agnew in the little cabin of the _Clydevalley_.\r\n\r\nThe latter had amply made up for the loss of time caused by some\r\nmisunderstanding as to the rendezvous at the Tuskar, for he was able to\r\nshow Crawford, to his intense delight, that the cargo had all been\r\nsafely and successfully transferred to the hold of the _Clydevalley_ in\r\na bay on the Welsh coast, mainly at night. Some sixteen transport\r\nlabourers from Belfast, willing Ulster hands, had shifted the stuff in\r\nless than half the time taken by Germans at Langeland over the same job.\r\nThere was, therefore, nothing more to be done except to steam leisurely\r\nto Copeland, for which there was ample time before Friday evening. The\r\n_Fanny_ had departed to an appointed rendezvous on the Baltic coast of\r\nDenmark.\r\n\r\nIt was now the turn of the _Clydevalley_ to yield up her obscure\r\nidentity, and to assume an historic name appropriate to the adventure\r\nshe was bringing to a triumphant climax--a name of good omen in Ulster\r\nears. Strips of canvas, 6 feet long, were cut and painted with white\r\nletters on a black ground, and affixed to bows and stern, so that the\r\nmen waiting at Copeland might hail the arrival of the _Mountjoy II_.\r\n\r\nOff Copeland Island a small vessel was waiting, which Agnew recognised\r\nas a tender belonging to Messrs. Workman & Clark. The men on board, as\r\nsoon as they could make out the name of the approaching vessel,\r\nunderstood at once, and raised a ringing cheer. Two of them were seen\r\ngesticulating and hailing the _Mountjoy_. Crawford, suspecting fresh\r\norders to retreat, paid no attention, and told Agnew to hold on his\r\ncourse; and even when presently he was able to recognise Mr. Cowser and\r\nMr. Dawson Bates on board the tender, and to hear them shouting that\r\nthey had important instructions for him, he still refused to let them\r\ncome on board. \"If the orders are not signed by Sir Edward Carson,\" he\r\nshouted back, \"you can take them back to where they came from.\" But the\r\norders they brought had been signed by the leader, a special messenger\r\nhaving been sent to London to obtain his signature, and the change of\r\nplan they indicated was, in fact, just what Crawford desired. The bulk\r\nof the arms were to be landed at Larne, the port he had always favoured,\r\nand lesser quantities were to be taken to Bangor and Donaghadee.\r\n\r\nIt was 10.30 that night, the 24th of April 1914, when the _Mountjoy II_\r\nsteamed alongside the landing-stage at Larne, where she had been eagerly\r\nawaited for a couple of hours. The voyage of adventure was over. Fred\r\nCrawford, with the able and zealous help of Andrew Agnew, had\r\naccomplished the difficult and dangerous task he had undertaken, and a\r\nservice had been rendered to Ulster not unworthy to rank beside the\r\nbreaking of the boom across the Foyle by the first and more renowned\r\n_Mountjoy_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[87] _Annual Register_, 1914, p. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nON THE BRINK OF CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrangements that had been made for the landing and disposal of the\r\narms when they arrived in port were the work of an extremely efficient\r\nand complete organisation. In the previous summer Captain Spender, it\r\nwill be remembered, had been appointed to a position on Sir George\r\nRichardson's staff which included in its duties that of the organisation\r\nof transport. A railway board, a supply board, and a transport board had\r\nbeen formed, on which leading business men willingly served; every\r\nU.V.F. unit had its horse transport, and in addition a special motor\r\ncorps, organised in squadrons, and a special corps of motor-lorries were\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nMore than half the owners of motor-cars in Ulster placed their cars at\r\nthe disposal of the motor corps, to be used as and when required. The\r\ncorps was organised in sections of four cars each, and in squadrons of\r\nseventeen cars each, with motor cyclist despatch-riders; a signalling\r\ncorps of despatch-riders and signallers completed the organisation. The\r\nlively interest aroused by the practice and displays of the\r\nlast-mentioned corps did much to promote the high standard of\r\nproficiency attained by its \"flag-waggers,\" many of whom were women and\r\ngirls. In particular the signalling-station at Bangor gained a\r\nreputation which attracted many English sympathisers with Ulster to pay\r\nit a visit when they came to Belfast for the great Unionist\r\ndemonstrations.\r\n\r\nThe despatch-riders on motor-cycles made the Ulster Council independent\r\nof the Post Office, which for very good reasons they used as little as\r\npossible. Post-houses were opened at all the most important centres in\r\nUlster, between which messages were transmitted by despatch-rider or\r\nsignal according to the nature of the intervening country. Along the\r\ncoast of Down and Antrim the organisation of signals was complete and\r\neffective. The usefulness of the despatch-riders' corps was fully tested\r\nand proved during the Curragh Incident, when news of all that was taking\r\nplace at the Curragh was received by this means two or three times a day\r\nat the Old Town Hall in Belfast, where there was much information of\r\nwhat was going on that was unknown at the Irish Office in London.\r\n\r\nAll this organisation was at the disposal of the leaders for handling\r\nthe arms brought in the hold of the _Mountjoy II_. The perfection of the\r\narrangements for the immediate distribution of the rifles and ammunition\r\namong the loyalist population, and the almost miraculous precision with\r\nwhich they were carried out on that memorable Friday night, extorted the\r\nadmiration even of the most inveterate political enemies of Ulster. The\r\nsmoothness with which the machinery of organisation worked was only\r\npossible on account of the hearty willingness of all the workers,\r\ncombined with the discipline to which they gladly submitted themselves.\r\n\r\nThe whole U.V.F. was warned for a trial mobilisation on the evening of\r\nthe 24th of April, and the owners of all motor-cars and lorries were\r\nrequested to co-operate. Very few either of the Volunteers or the motor\r\nowners knew that anything more than manoeuvres by night for practice\r\npurposes was to take place. All motors from certain specified districts\r\nwere ordered to be at Larne by 8 o'clock in the evening; from other\r\ndistricts the vehicles were to assemble at Bangor and Donaghadee\r\nrespectively, at a later hour. All the roads leading to these ports were\r\npatrolled by volunteers, and at every cross-roads over the greater part\r\nof nine counties men of the local battalions were stationed to give\r\ndirections to motor-drivers who might not be familiar with the roads. At\r\ncertain points these men were provided with reserve supplies of petrol,\r\nand with repairing tools that might be needed in case of breakdown. It\r\nis a remarkable testimony to the zeal of these men for the cause that,\r\nalthough none of them knew he was taking part in an exciting adventure,\r\nnot one, so far as is known, left his post throughout a cold and wet\r\nnight, having received orders not to go home till daybreak. And these\r\nwere men, it must be remembered, who before putting on the felt hats,\r\nputtees, and bandoliers which constituted their uniform, had already\r\ndone a full day's work, and were not to receive a sixpence for their\r\nnight's job.\r\n\r\nAt the three ports of discharge large forces of volunteers were\r\nconcentrated. Sir George Richardson, G.O.C. in C., remained in Belfast\r\nthrough the night, being kept fully and constantly informed of the\r\nprogress of events by signal and motor-cyclist despatch-riders. Captain\r\nJames Craig was in charge of the operations at Bangor; at Larne General\r\nSir William Adair was in command, with Captain Spender as Staff officer.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Customs authorities in Belfast was diverted by a\r\nclever stratagem. A tramp steamer was brought up the Musgrave Channel\r\nafter dark, her conduct being as furtive and suspicious as it was\r\npossible to make it appear. At the same time a large wagon was brought\r\nto the docks as if awaiting a load. The skipper of the tramp took an\r\nunconscionable time, by skilful blundering, in bringing his craft to her\r\nmoorings. The suspicions of the authorities were successfully aroused;\r\nbut every possible hindrance was put in their way when they began to\r\ninvestigate. The hour was too late: could they not wait till daylight?\r\nNo? Well, then, what was their authority? When that was settled, it\r\nappeared that the skipper had mislaid his keys and could not produce the\r\nship's papers--and so on. By these devices the belief of the officers\r\nthat they had caught the offender they were after was increasingly\r\nconfirmed every minute, while several hours passed before they were\r\nallowed to realise that they had discovered a mare's-nest. For when at\r\nlast they \"would stand no more nonsense,\" and had the hatches opened and\r\nthe papers produced, the latter were quite in order, and the\r\ncargo--which they wasted a little additional time in turning\r\nover--contained nothing but coal.\r\n\r\nMeantime the real business was proceeding twenty miles away. All\r\ncommunications by wire from the three ports were blocked by \"earthing\"\r\nthe wires, so as to cause short circuit. The police and coast-guards\r\nwere \"peacefully picketed,\" as trade unionists would call it, in their\r\nvarious barracks--they were shut in and strongly guarded. No conflict\r\ntook place anywhere between the authorities and the volunteers, and the\r\nonly casualty of any kind was the unfortunate death of one\r\ncoast-guardsman from heart disease at Donaghadee.\r\n\r\nAt Larne, where much the largest portion of the _Mountjoy's_ cargo was\r\nlanded, a triple cordon of Volunteers surrounded the town and harbour,\r\nand no one without a pass was allowed through. The motors arrived with a\r\npunctuality that was wonderful, considering that many of them had come\r\nfrom long distances. As the drivers arrived near the town and found\r\nthemselves in an apparently endless procession of similar vehicles,\r\ntheir astonishment and excitement became intense. Only when close to the\r\nharbour did they learn what they were there for, and received\r\ninstructions how to proceed. They had more than two hours to wait in\r\ndrizzling rain before the _Mountjoy_ appeared round the point of\r\nIslandmagee, although her approach had been made known to Spender by\r\nsignal at dusk. There were about five hundred motor vehicles assembled\r\nat Larne alone, and such an invasion of flaring head-lights gave the\r\ninhabitants of the little town unwonted excitement. Practically all the\r\nable-bodied men of the place were either on duty as Volunteers or were\r\nwilling workers in the landing of the arms. The women stood at their\r\ndoors and gave encouraging greeting to the drivers; many of them ran\r\nimprovised canteens, which supplied the workers with welcome\r\nrefreshments during the night.\r\n\r\nThere was a not unnatural tendency at first on the part of some of the\r\nmotor-drivers to look upon the event more in the light of a meet of\r\nhounds than of the gravest possible business, and to hang about\r\ndiscussing the adventure with the other \"sportsmen.\" But the use of\r\nvigorous language brought them back to recognition of the seriousness of\r\nthe work before them, and the discharge of the cargo proceeded hour\r\nafter hour with the utmost rapidity and with the regularity of a\r\nwell-oiled machine. The cars drew up beside the _Mountjoy_ in an endless\r\n_queue_; each received its quota of bales according to its carrying\r\ncapacity, and was despatched on its homeward journey without a moment's\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of Crawford's system of packing was fully vindicated. There\r\nwas no confusion, no waiting to bring ammunition from one part of the\r\nship's hold to match with rifles brought from another, and bayonets from\r\na third. The packages, as they were carried from the steamer or the\r\ncranes, were counted by checking clerks, and their destination noted as\r\neach car received its load. But even the large number of vehicles\r\navailable would have been insufficient for the purpose on hand if each\r\nhad been limited to a single load; dumps had therefore been formed at a\r\nnumber of selected places in the surrounding districts, where the arms\r\nwere temporarily deposited so as to allow the cars to return and perform\r\nthe same duty several times during the night.\r\n\r\nWhile the _Mountjoy_ was discharging the Larne consignment on to the\r\nquay, she was at the same time transhipping a smaller quantity into a\r\nmotor-boat, moored against her side, which when laden hurried off to\r\nDonaghadee; and she left Larne at 5 in the morning to discharge the last\r\nportion of her cargo at Bangor, which was successfully accomplished in\r\nbroad daylight after her arrival there about 7.30.\r\n\r\nCrawford refused to leave the ship at either Larne or Bangor, feeling\r\nhimself bound in honour to remain with the crew until they were safe\r\nfrom arrest by the naval authorities. It was well known in Belfast that\r\na look-out was being kept for the _Fanny_, which had figured in the\r\nPress as \"the mystery ship\" ever since the affair at Langeland, and had\r\nseveral times been reported to have been viewed at all sorts of odd\r\nplaces on the map, from the Orkneys to Tory Island. Just as Agnew was\r\ncasting off from Bangor, when the last bale of arms had gone ashore, a\r\nmessage from U.V.F. headquarters informed him that a thirty-knot cruiser\r\nwas out looking for the _Fanny_. To mislead the coast-guards on shore a\r\ncourse was immediately set for the Clyde--the very quarter from which a\r\ncruiser coming from Lamlash was to be expected--and when some way out to\r\nsea Crawford cut the cords holding the canvas sheets that bore the name\r\nof the _Mountjoy_, so that within five minutes the filibustering pirate\r\nhad again become the staid old collier _Clydevalley_, which for months\r\npast had carried her regular weekly cargo of coal from Scotland to\r\nBelfast. As before at Langeland, so now at Copeland, fog providentially\r\ncovered retreat, and through it the _Clydevalley_ made her way\r\nundetected down the Irish Sea. At daybreak next morning Crawford landed\r\nat Rosslare; and Agnew then proceeded along the French and Danish coasts\r\nto the Baltic to the rendezvous with the _Fanny_, in order to bring back\r\nthe Ulstermen members of her crew, after which \"the mystery ship\" was\r\nfinally disposed of at Hamburg.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Carson and Lord Londonderry were both in London on the 24th\r\nof April. At an early hour next morning a telegram was delivered to each\r\nof them, containing the single word \"Lion.\" It was a code message\r\nsignifying that the landing of the arms had been carried out without a\r\nhitch. Before long special editions of the newspapers proclaimed the\r\nnews to all the world, and as fresh details appeared in every successive\r\nissue during the day the public excitement grew in intensity. Wherever\r\ntwo or three Unionists were gathered together exultation was the\r\nprevailing mood, and eagerness to send congratulations to friends in\r\nUlster.\r\n\r\nSoon after breakfast a visitor to Sir Edward Carson found a motor\r\nbrougham standing at his door, and on being admitted was told that \"Lord\r\nRoberts is with Sir Edward.\" The great little Field-Marshal, on learning\r\nthe news, had lost not a moment in coming to offer his congratulations\r\nto the Ulster leader. \"Magnificent!\" he exclaimed, on entering the room\r\nand holding out his hand, \"magnificent! nothing could have been better\r\ndone; it was a piece of organisation that any army in Europe might be\r\nproud of.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was not to be expected that the Government and its supporters\r\nwould relish the news. The Radical Press, of course, rang all the\r\nchanges of angry vituperation, especially those papers which had been\r\nprominent in ridiculing \"Ulster bluff\" and \"King Carson's wooden guns\";\r\nand they now speculated as to whether Carson could be \"convicted of\r\ncomplicity\" in what Mr. Asquith in the House of Commons described as\r\n\"this grave and unprecedented outrage.\" Carson soon set that question at\r\nrest by quietly rising in his place in the House and saying that he took\r\nfull responsibility for everything that had been done. The Prime\r\nMinister, amid the frenzied cheers of his followers, assured the House\r\nthat \"His Majesty's Government will take, without delay, appropriate\r\nsteps to vindicate the authority of the law.\" For a short time there was\r\nsome curiosity as to what the appropriate steps would be. None, however,\r\nof any sort were taken; the Government contented itself with sending a\r\nfew destroyers to patrol for a short time the coasts of Antrim and Down,\r\nwhere they were saluted by the Ulster Signalling Stations, and their\r\nofficers hospitably entertained on shore by loyalist residents.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of April a further debate on the Curragh Incident took place\r\nin the House of Commons, which was a curious example of the rapid\r\nchanges of mood that characterise that Assembly. Most of the speeches\r\nboth from the front and back benches were, if possible, even more\r\nbitter, angry, and defiant than usual. But at the close of one of the\r\nbitterest of them all Mr. Churchill read a typewritten passage that was\r\nrecognised as a tiny olive-branch held out to Ulster. Carson responded\r\nnext day in a conciliatory tone, and the Prime Minister was thought to\r\nsuggest a renewal of negotiations in private. For some time nothing came\r\nof this hint; but on the 12th of May Mr. Asquith announced that the\r\nthird reading of the Home Rule Bill (for the third successive year, as\r\nrequired by the Parliament Act before being presented for the signature\r\nof the King) would be taken before Whitsuntide, but that the Government\r\nintended to make another attempt to appease Ulster by introducing \"an\r\namending proposal, in the hope that a settlement by agreement may be\r\narrived at\"; and that the two Bills--the Home Rule Bill and the Bill to\r\namend it--might become law practically at the same time. But he gave no\r\nhint as to what the \"amending proposal\" was to be, and the reception of\r\nthe announcement by the Opposition did not seem to presage agreement.\r\n\r\nMr. Bonar Law insisted that the House of Commons ought to be told what\r\nthe Amending Bill would propose, before it was asked finally to pass the\r\nHome Rule Bill. But the real fact was, as every member of the House of\r\nCommons fully realised, that Mr. Asquith was not a free agent in this\r\nmatter. The Nationalists were not at all pleased at the attempts already\r\nmade, trivial as they were, to satisfy Ulster, and Mr. Redmond protested\r\nagainst the promise of an Amending Bill of any kind. Mr. Asquith could\r\nmake no proposal sufficient to allay the hostility of Ulster that would\r\nnot alienate the Nationalists, whose support was essential to the\r\ncontinuance of his Government in office.\r\n\r\nOn the same day as this debate in Parliament the result of a by-election\r\nat Grimsby was announced in which the Unionist candidate retained the\r\nseat; a week later the Unionists won a seat in Derbyshire; and two days\r\nafterwards crowned these successes with a resounding victory at Ipswich.\r\nThe last-mentioned contest was considered so important that Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge and Sir Edward Carson went down to speak the evening before the\r\npoll for their respective sides. Mr. Lloyd George, the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, made his appeal to the cupidity of the constituency, which\r\nwas informed that it would gain £15,000 a year from his new Budget, in\r\naddition to large sums, of which he gave the figure, for old age\r\npensions and under the Government's Health Insurance Act.[88] Sir Edward\r\nCarson laid stress on Ulster's determination to resist Home Rule by\r\nforce. The Unionist candidate won the seat next day in this essentially\r\nworking-class constituency by a substantial majority, although his\r\nLiberal opponent, Mr. Masterman, was a Cabinet Minister trying for the\r\nsecond time to return to Parliament. Out of seven elections since the\r\nbeginning of the session the Government had lost four.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the two latest new members took their seats on the 25th\r\nof May, on which date the Home Rule Bill was passed by the House of\r\nCommons on third reading for the last time. The occasion was celebrated\r\nby the Nationalists, not unnaturally, by a great demonstration of\r\ntriumph, both in the House itself and outside in Palace Yard. Men on the\r\nother side reflected that the tragedy of civil war had been brought one\r\nstage nearer.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Ulster to the passing of the Bill was a series of reviews\r\nof the U.V.F. during the Whitsuntide recess. Carson, Londonderry, Craig,\r\nand most of the other Ulster members attended these parades, which\r\nexcited intense enthusiasm through the country, more especially as the\r\narms brought by the _Mountjoy_ were now seen for the first time in the\r\nhands of the Volunteers. Several battalions were presented with Colours\r\nwhich had been provided by Lady Londonderry, Lady Massereene, Mrs.\r\nCraig, and other local ladies, and the ceremony included the dedication\r\nof these Colours by the Bishop of Down and the Moderator of the\r\nPresbyterian Church. Many visitors from England witnessed these\r\ndisplays, and among them were several deputations of Liberal and Labour\r\nworking men, who reported on their return that what they had seen had\r\nconverted them to sympathy with Ulster.[89]\r\n\r\nAfter the recess the promised Amending Bill was introduced in the House\r\nof Lords on the 23rd of June by the Marquis of Crewe, who explained that\r\nit embodied Mr. Asquith's proposals of the 9th of March, and that he\r\ninvited amendments. Lord Lansdowne at once declared that these\r\nproposals, which had been rejected as inadequate three months ago, were\r\ndoubly insufficient now. But the invitation to amend the Bill was\r\naccepted, Lord Londonderry asking the pertinent question whether the\r\nGovernment would tell Mr. Redmond that they would insist on acceptance\r\nof any amendments made in response to Lord Crewe's invitation--a\r\nquestion to which no answer was forthcoming. Lord Milner, in the course\r\nof the debate, said the Bill would have to be entirely remodelled, and\r\nhe laid stress on the point that if Ulster were coerced to join the rest\r\nof Ireland it would make a united Ireland for ever impossible, and that\r\nthe employment of the Army and Navy for the purpose of coercion would\r\ngive a shock to the Empire which it would not long survive; to which\r\nLord Roberts added that such a policy would mean the utter destruction\r\nof the Army, as he had warned the Prime Minister before the incident at\r\nthe Curragh.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of July the Bill was amended by substituting the permanent\r\nexclusion of the whole province of Ulster--which Mr. Balfour had named\r\n\"the clean cut\"--for the proposed county option with a time limit; and\r\nseveral other alterations of minor importance were also made. The Bill\r\nas amended passed the third reading on the 14th, when Lord Lansdowne\r\npredicted that, whatever might be the fate of the measure and of the\r\nHome Rule Bill which it modified, the one thing certain was that the\r\nidea of coercing Ulster was dead.\r\n\r\nIn Ulster itself, meanwhile, the people were bent on making Lord\r\nLansdowne's certainty doubly sure. Carson went over for the Boyne\r\ncelebration on the 12th of July. The frequency of his visits did nothing\r\nto damp the ardour with which his arrival was always hailed by his\r\nfollowers. The same wonderful scenes, whether at Larne or at the Belfast\r\ndocks, were repeated time after time without appearing to grow stale by\r\nrepetition. They gave colour to the Radical jeer at \"King Carson,\" for\r\nno royal personage could have been given a more regal reception than was\r\naccorded to \"Sir Edward\" (as everybody affectionately called him in\r\nBelfast) half a dozen times within a few months.\r\n\r\nThis occasion, when he arrived on the 10th by the Liverpool steamer,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Walter Long, was no exception. His route had been\r\nannounced in the Press. Countless Union Jacks were displayed in every\r\nvillage along both shores of the Lough. Every vessel at anchor,\r\nincluding the gigantic White Star Liner _Britannic_, was dressed; every\r\nfog-horn bellowed a welcome; the multitude of men at work in the great\r\nship-yards crowded to places commanding a view of the incoming packet,\r\nand waved handkerchiefs and raised cheers for Sir Edward; fellow\r\npassengers jostled each other to get sight of him as he went down the\r\ngangway and to give him a parting cheer from the deck; the dock sheds\r\nwere packed with people, many of them bare-headed and bare-footed\r\nwomen, who pressed close in the hope of touching his hand, or hearing\r\none of his kindly and humorous greetings. It was the same in the streets\r\nall the way from the docks to the centre of the city, and out through\r\nthe working-class district of Ballymacarret to the country beyond, and\r\nin every hamlet on the road to Newtownards and Mount Stewart--people\r\ncongregating to give him a cheer as he passed in Lord Londonderry's\r\nmotor-car, or pausing in their work on the land to wave a greeting from\r\nfields bordering the road.\r\n\r\nRadical newspapers in England believed--or at any rate tried to make\r\ntheir readers believe--that the \"Northcliffe Press,\" particularly _The\r\nTimes_ and _Daily Mail_, gave an exaggerated account of these\r\nextraordinary demonstrations of welcome to Carson, and of the\r\nimpressiveness of the great meetings which he addressed. But the\r\naccounts in Lord Northcliffe's papers did not differ materially from\r\nthose in other journals like _The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Express,\r\nThe Standard, The Morning Post, The Observer, The Scotsman_, and _The\r\nSpectator_. There was no exaggeration. The special correspondents gave\r\nfaithful accounts of what they saw and heard, and no more. Editorial\r\nsupport was a different matter. Lord Northcliffe's papers were unfailing\r\nin their support of the Ulster cause, as were many other great British\r\njournals; and even when at a later period Lord Northcliffe's attitude on\r\nthe general question of Irish government underwent a change that was\r\nprofoundly disappointing to Ulstermen, his papers never countenanced the\r\nidea of applying coercion to Ulster. In the years 1911 to 1914 _The\r\nTimes_ remained true to the tradition started by John Walter, who,\r\nhimself a Liberal, went personally to Belfast in 1886 to inform himself\r\non the question, then for the first time raised by Gladstone; and,\r\nhaving done so, supported the loyalist cause in Ireland till his death.\r\nA series of weighty articles in 1913 and 1914 approved and encouraged\r\nthe resistance threatened by Ulster to Home Rule, and justified the\r\nmeasures taken in preparation for it. Whatever may have been the reason\r\nfor a different attitude at a later date, Ulster owed a debt of\r\ngratitude to _The Times_ in those troubled years.\r\n\r\nThe long-expected crisis appeared to be very close when Carson arrived\r\nin Belfast on the 10th of July, 1914. He had come to attend a meeting of\r\nthe Ulster Unionist Council--sitting for the first time as the\r\nProvisional Government. Craig communicated to the Press the previous day\r\nthe Preamble and some of the articles of the Constitution of the\r\nProvisional Government, hitherto kept strictly secret, one article being\r\nthat the administration would be taken over \"in trust for the\r\nConstitution of the United Kingdom,\" and that \"upon the restoration of\r\ndirect Imperial Government, the Provisional Government shall cease to\r\nexist.\"\r\n\r\nAt this session on the 10th, the proceedings of which were private,\r\nCarson explained the extreme gravity of the situation now reached. The\r\nHome Rule Bill would become law probably in a few weeks. It was pretty\r\ncertain that the Nationalists would not permit the Government to accept\r\nthe Amending Bill in the altered form in which it had left the Upper\r\nHouse. In that case, nothing remained for them in Ulster but to carry\r\nout the policy they had resolved upon long ago, and to make good the\r\nCovenant. After his forty minutes' speech a quiet and business-like\r\ndiscussion followed. Plenary authority to take any action necessary in\r\nemergency was conferred unanimously on the executive. The course to be\r\nfollowed in assuming the administration was explained and agreed to, and\r\nwhen they separated all the members felt that the crisis for which they\r\nhad been preparing so long had at last come upon them. There was no\r\nflinching.\r\n\r\nNext day there was a parade of 3,000 U.V.F. at Larne. A distinguished\r\nAmerican who was present said after the march past, \"You could destroy\r\nthese Volunteers, but you could not conquer them.\" Carson spoke with\r\nexceptional solemnity to the men, telling them candidly that, \"unless\r\nsomething happens the evidence of which is not visible at present,\" he\r\ncould discern nothing but darkness ahead, and no hope of peace. He ended\r\nby exhorting his followers throughout Ulster to preserve their\r\nself-control and to \"commit no act against any individual or against any\r\nman's property which would sully the great name you have already won.\"\r\n\r\nAs usual, his influence was powerful enough to prevent disturbance. The\r\nGovernment had made extensive military preparations to maintain order on\r\nthe 12th of July; but, as a well-known \"character\" in Belfast expressed\r\nit, \"Sir Edward was worth twenty battalions in keeping order.\" The\r\nanniversary was celebrated everywhere by enormous masses of men in a\r\nstate of tense excitement. Lord Londonderry addressed an immense\r\ngathering at Enniskillen; seventy thousand Orangemen marched from\r\nBelfast to Drumbeg to hear Carson, who sounded the same warning note as\r\nat Larne two days before. But nowhere throughout the Province was a\r\nsingle occurrence reported that called for action by the police.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ulster leaders returned to London on the 14th they were met by\r\nreports of differences in the Cabinet over the Amending Bill, which was\r\nto be brought before the House of Commons on the following Monday.\r\nNationalist pressure no doubt dictated the deletion of the amendments\r\nmade by the Peers and the restoration of the Bill to its original shape.\r\nA minority of the Cabinet was said to be opposed to this course. Whether\r\nthat was true or false, the Prime Minister must by this time have\r\nrealised that he had allowed the country to drift to the brink of civil\r\nwar, and that some genuine effort must be made to arrive at a peaceable\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nAccordingly on Monday, the 20th, instead of introducing the Amending\r\nBill, Mr. Asquith announced in the House of Commons that His Majesty the\r\nKing, \"in view of the grave situation which has arisen, has thought it\r\nright to summon representatives of parties, both British and Irish, to a\r\nconference at Buckingham Palace, with the object of discussing\r\noutstanding issues in relation to the problem of Irish Government.\" The\r\nPrime Minister added that at the King's suggestion the Speaker, Mr.\r\nJames Lowther, would preside over the Conference, which would begin its\r\nproceedings the following day.\r\n\r\nThe Liberals, the British Unionists, the Nationalists, and the Ulstermen\r\nwere respectively represented at the Buckingham Palace Conference by Mr.\r\nAsquith and Mr. Lloyd George, Lord Lansdowne and Mr. Bonar Law, Mr.\r\nRedmond and Mr. Dillon, Sir Edward Carson and Captain James Craig. The\r\nKing opened the Conference in person on the 21st with a speech\r\nrecognising the extreme gravity of the situation, and making an\r\nimpressive appeal for a peaceful settlement of the question at issue.\r\nHis Majesty then withdrew. The Conference deliberated for four days, but\r\nwere unable to agree as to what area in Ulster should be excluded from\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Parliament in Dublin. On the 24th Mr. Asquith\r\nannounced the breakdown of the Conference, and said that in consequence\r\nthe Amending Bill would be introduced in the House of Commons on\r\nThursday, the 30th of July.\r\n\r\nHere was the old deadlock. The last glimmer of hope that civil war might\r\nbe averted seemed to be extinguished. Only ten days had elapsed since\r\nCarson had gloomily predicted at Larne that peace was impossible \"unless\r\nsomething happens, the evidence of which is not visible at present.\" But\r\nthat \"something\" did happen--though it was something infinitely more\r\ndreadful, infinitely more devastating in its consequences, even though\r\nless dishonouring to the nation, than the alternative from which it\r\nsaved us. Balanced, as it seemed, on the brink of civil war, Great\r\nBritain and Ireland together toppled over on the other side into the\r\nmaelstrom of world-wide war.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of July, when the Amending Bill was to be discussed, the\r\nPrime Minister said that, with the concurrence of Mr. Bonar Law and Sir\r\nEdward Carson, it would be indefinitely postponed, in order that the\r\ncountry at this grave crisis in the history of the world \"should present\r\na united front and be able to speak and act with the authority of an\r\nundivided nation.\" To achieve this, all domestic quarrels must be laid\r\naside, and he promised that \"no business of a controversial character\"\r\nwould be undertaken.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that the Amending Bill was never seen by the House of\r\nCommons. Four days later the United Kingdom was at war with the greatest\r\nmilitary Empire in the world. The opportunity had come for Ulster to\r\nprove whether her cherished loyalty was a reality or a sham.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] _Annual Register_, 1914, p. 110.\r\n\r\n[89] _Annual Register_, 1914, p. 114.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nULSTER IN THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than a year before the outbreak of the Great War a writer in _The\r\nMorning Post_, describing the Ulster Volunteers who were then beginning\r\nto attract attention in England, used language which was more accurately\r\nprophetic than he can have realised in May 1913:\r\n\r\n     \"What these men have been preparing for in Ulster,\" he wrote, \"may\r\n     be of value as a military asset in time of national emergency. I\r\n     have seen the men at drill, I have seen them on parade, and experts\r\n     assure me that in the matter of discipline, physique, and all\r\n     things which go to the making of a military force they are worthy\r\n     to rank with our regular soldiers. It is an open secret that, once\r\n     assured of the maintenance unimpaired of the Union between Great\r\n     Britain and Ireland under the Imperial Parliament alone, a vast\r\n     proportion of the citizen army of Ulster would cheerfully hold\r\n     itself at the disposal of the Imperial Government and volunteer for\r\n     service either at home or abroad!\"[90]\r\n\r\nThe only error in the prediction was that the writer underestimated the\r\nsacrifice Ulster would be willing to make for the Empire. When the\r\ntesting time came fifteen months after this appreciation was published\r\nall hope of unimpaired maintenance of the Union had to be sorrowfully\r\ngiven up, and only those who were in a position to comprehend, with\r\nsympathy, the depth and intensity of the feeling in Ulster on the\r\nsubject could realise all that this meant to the people there. Yet, all\r\nthe same, their \"citizen army\" did not hesitate to \"hold itself at the\r\ndisposal of the Imperial Government, and volunteer for service at home\r\nor abroad.\"\r\n\r\nIn August 1914 the U.V.F., of 100.000 men, was without question the\r\nmost efficient force of infantry in the United Kingdom outside the\r\nRegular Army. The medical comb did not seriously thin its ranks; and\r\nalthough the age test considerably reduced its number, it still left a\r\nbody of fine material for the British Army. Some of the best of its\r\nofficers, like Captain Arthur O'Neill, M.P., of the Life Guards, and\r\nLord Castlereagh of the Blues, had to leave the U.V.F. to rejoin the\r\nregiments to which they belonged, or to take up staff appointments at\r\nthe front. In spite of such losses there was a strong desire in the\r\nforce, which was shared by the political leaders, that it should be kept\r\nintact as far as possible and form a distinct unit for active service,\r\nand efforts were at once made to get the War Office to arrange for this\r\nto be done. Pressure of work at the War Office, and Lord Kitchener's\r\naversion from anything that he thought savoured of political\r\nconsiderations in the organisation of the Army, imposed a delay of\r\nseveral weeks before this was satisfactorily arranged; and the\r\nconsequence was that in the first few weeks of the war a large number of\r\nthe keenest young men in Ulster enlisted in various regiments before it\r\nwas known that an Ulster Division was to be formed out of the U.V.F.\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of September before Carson was in a position to go\r\nto Belfast to announce that such an arrangement had been made with Lord\r\nKitchener. And when he went he had also the painful duty of telling the\r\npeople of Ulster that the Government was going to give them the meanest\r\nrecompense for the promptitude with which they had thrown aside all\r\nparty purposes in order to assist the Empire.\r\n\r\nWhen war broke out a \"party truce\" had been proclaimed. The Unionist\r\nleaders promised their support to the Government in carrying on the war,\r\nand Mr. Asquith pledged the Government to drop all controversial\r\nlegislation. The consideration of the Amending Bill had been shelved by\r\nagreement, Mr. Asquith stating that the postponement \"must be without\r\nprejudice to the domestic and political position of any party.\" On this\r\nunderstanding the Unionist Party supported, almost without so much as a\r\nword of criticism, all the emergency measures proposed by the\r\nGovernment. Yet on the 10th of August Mr. Asquith astonished the\r\nUnionists by announcing that the promise to take no controversial\r\nbusiness was not to prevent him advising the King to sign the Home Rule\r\nBill, which had been hung up in the House of Lords by the introduction\r\nof the Amending Bill, and had never been either rejected or passed by\r\nthat House.\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour immediately protested against this conduct as a breach of\r\nfaith; but Mr. Redmond's speech on that occasion contained the\r\nexplanation of the Government's conduct. The Nationalist leader gave a\r\nstrong hint that any help in the war from the southern provinces of\r\nIreland would depend on whether or not the Home Rule Bill was to become\r\nlaw at once. Although the personal loyalty of Mr. Redmond was beyond\r\nquestion, and although he was no doubt sincere when he subsequently\r\ndenied that his speech was so intended, it was in reality an application\r\nof the old maxim that England's difficulty is Ireland's opportunity. In\r\nany case, the Cabinet knew that, however unjustly Ulster might be\r\ntreated, she could be relied upon to do everything in her power to\r\nfurther the successful prosecution of the war, and they cynically came\r\nto the conclusion that the best thing to do was to placate those whose\r\nloyalty was less assured.\r\n\r\nThis was the unpleasant tale that Sir Edward Carson had to unfold to the\r\nUlster Unionist Council on the 3rd of September. After explaining how\r\nand why he had consented to the indefinite postponement of the Amending\r\nBill, he continued:\r\n\r\n     \"And so, without any condition of any kind, we agreed that the Bill\r\n     should be postponed without prejudice to the position of either\r\n     party. England's difficulty is not Ulster's opportunity. England's\r\n     difficulty is our difficulty; and England's sorrows have always\r\n     been, and always will be, our sorrows. I have seen it stated that\r\n     the Germans thought they had hit on an opportune moment, owing to\r\n     our domestic difficulties, to make their bullying demand against\r\n     our country. They little understood for what we were fighting. We\r\n     were not fighting to get away from England; we were fighting to\r\n     stay with England, and the Power that attempted to lay a hand upon\r\n     England, whatever might be our domestic quarrels, would at once\r\n     bring us together--as it has brought us together--as one man.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid controversy at such a time, Carson declared he would\r\nsay nothing about their opponents. He insisted that, however unworthily\r\nthe Government might act in a great national emergency, Ulstermen must\r\ndistinguish between the Prime Minister as a party leader and the Prime\r\nMinister as the representative of the whole nation. Their duty was to\r\n\"think not of him or his party, but of our country,\" and they must show\r\nthat \"we do not seek to purchase terms by selling our patriotism.\" He\r\nthen referred to the pride they all felt in the U.V.F.; how he had\r\n\"watched them grow from infancy,\" through self-sacrificing toil to their\r\npresent high efficiency, with the purpose of \"allowing us to be put into\r\nno degraded position in the United Kingdom.\" But under the altered\r\nconditions their duty was clear:\r\n\r\n     \"Our country and our Empire are in danger. And under these\r\n     circumstances, knowing that the very basis of our political faith\r\n     is our belief in the greatness of the United Kingdom and of the\r\n     Empire, I say to our Volunteers without hesitation, go and help to\r\n     save your country. Go and win honour for Ulster and for Ireland. To\r\n     every man that goes, or has gone, and not to them only, but to\r\n     every Irishman, you and I say, from the bottom of our hearts, 'God\r\n     bless you and bring you home safe and victorious.'\"\r\n\r\nThe arrangements with the War Office for forming a Division from the\r\nUlster Volunteers were then explained, which would enable the men \"to go\r\nas old comrades accustomed to do their military training together.\"\r\nCarson touched lightly on fears that had been expressed lest political\r\nadvantage should be taken by the Government or by the Nationalists of\r\nthe conversion of the U.V.F. into a Division of the British Army, which\r\nwould leave Ulster defenceless. \"We are quite strong enough,\" he said,\r\n\"to take care of ourselves, and so I say to men, so far as they have\r\nconfidence and trust in me, that I advise them to go and do their duty\r\nto the country, and we will take care of politics hereafter.\" He\r\nconcluded by moving a resolution, which was unanimously carried by the\r\nCouncil, urging \"all Loyalists who owe allegiance to our cause\" to join\r\nthe Army at once if qualified for military service.\r\n\r\nFrom beginning to end of this splendidly patriotic oration no allusion\r\nwas made to the Nationalist attitude to the war. Few people in Ulster\r\nhad any belief that the spots on the leopard were going to disappear,\r\neven when the Home Rule Bill had been placed on the Statute-book. The\r\n\"difficulty\" and the \"opportunity\" would continue in their old\r\nrelations. People in Belfast, as elsewhere, did justice to the patriotic\r\ntone of Mr. Redmond's speech in the House of Commons on the 3rd of\r\nAugust, which made so deep an impression in England; but they believed\r\nhim mistaken in attributing to \"the democracy of Ireland\" a complete\r\nchange of sentiment towards England, and their scepticism was more than\r\njustified by subsequent events.\r\n\r\nBut they also scrutinised more carefully than Englishmen the precise\r\nwords used by the Nationalist leader. Englishmen, both in the House of\r\nCommons and in the country, were carried off their feet in an ecstasy of\r\njoy and wonder at Mr. Redmond's confident offer of loyal help from\r\nIreland to the Empire in the mighty world conflict. Ireland was to be\r\n\"the one bright spot.\" Ulstermen, on the other hand, did not fail to\r\nobserve that the offer was limited to service at home. \"I say to the\r\nGovernment,\" said Mr. Redmond, \"that they may to-morrow withdraw every\r\none of their troops from Ireland. I say that the coast of Ireland will\r\nbe defended from foreign invasion by her armed sons, and for this\r\npurpose armed Nationalist Catholics in the South will be only too glad\r\nto join arms with the armed Protestant Ulstermen in the North.\"\r\n\r\nThese sentences were rapturously applauded in the House of Commons. When\r\nthey were read in Ulster the shrewd men of the North asked what danger\r\nthreatened the \"coast of Ireland\"; and whether, supposing there were a\r\ndanger, the British Navy would not be a surer defence than the \"armed\r\nsons\" of Ireland whether from South or North. It was not on the coast\r\nof Ireland but the coast of Flanders that men were needed, and it was\r\nthither that the \"armed Protestant Ulstermen\" were preparing to go in\r\nthousands. They would not be behind the Catholics of the South in the\r\nspirit of comradeship invoked by Mr. Redmond if they were to stand\r\nshoulder to shoulder under the fire of Prussian batteries; but they\r\ncould not wax enthusiastic over the suggestion that, while they went to\r\nFrance, Mr. Redmond's Nationalist Volunteers should be trained and armed\r\nby the Government to defend the Irish coast--and possibly, later, to\r\nimpose their will upon Ulster.\r\n\r\nThe organisation and the training of the Ulster Division forms no part\r\nof the present narrative, but it must be stated that after Carson's\r\nspeech on the 3rd of September, recruiting went on uninterruptedly and\r\nrapidly, and the whole energies of the local leaders and of the rank and\r\nfile were thrown into the work of preparation. Captain James Craig,\r\npromoted to be Lieutenant-Colonel, was appointed Q.M.G. of the Division;\r\nbut the arduous duties of this post, in which he tried to do the work of\r\nhalf a dozen men, brought about a complete breakdown of health some\r\nmonths later, with the result that, to his deep disappointment, he was\r\nforbidden to go with the Division to France. No one displayed a finer\r\nspirit than his brother, Mr. Charles Craig, M.P. for South Antrim. He\r\nhad never done any soldiering, as his brother had in South Africa, and\r\nhe was over military age in 1914; but he did not allow either his age,\r\nhis military inexperience, or his membership of the House of Commons to\r\nserve as excuse for separating himself from the men with whom he had\r\nlearnt the elements of drill in the U.V.F. He obtained a commission as\r\nCaptain in the Ulster Division, and went with it to France, where he was\r\nwounded and taken prisoner in the great engagement at Thiepval in the\r\nbattle of the Somme, and had to endure all the rigours of captivity in\r\nGermany till the end of the war. There was afterwards not a little\r\npungent comment among his friends on the fact that, when honours were\r\ndescending in showers on the heads of the just and the unjust alike, a\r\nfull share of which reached members of Parliament, sometimes for no very\r\nconspicuous merit, no recognition of any kind was awarded to this\r\ngallant Ulster officer, who had set so fine an example and\r\nunostentatiously done so much more than his duty.\r\n\r\nThe Government's act of treachery in regard to \"controversial business\"\r\nwas consummated on the 18th of September, when the Home Rule Bill\r\nreceived the Royal Assent. On the 15th Mr. Asquith put forward his\r\ndefence in the House of Commons. In a sentence of mellifluous optimism\r\nthat was to be woefully falsified in a not-distant future, he declared\r\nhis confidence that the action his Ministry was taking would bring \"for\r\nthe first time for a hundred years Irish opinion, Irish sentiment, Irish\r\nloyalty, flowing with a strong and a continuous and ever-increasing\r\nstream into the great reservoir of Imperial resources and Imperial\r\nunity.\" He acknowledged, however, that the Government had pledged itself\r\nnot to put the Home Rule Bill on the Statute-book until the Amending\r\nBill had been disposed of. That promise was not now to be kept; instead\r\nhe gave another, which, when the time came, was equally violated,\r\nnamely, to introduce the Amending Bill \"in the next session of\r\nParliament, before the Irish Government Bill can possibly come into\r\noperation.\" Meantime, there was to be a Suspensory Bill to provide that\r\nthe Home Rule Bill should remain in abeyance till the end of the war,\r\nand he gave an assurance \"which would be in spirit and in substance\r\ncompletely fulfilled, that the Home Rule Bill will not and cannot come\r\ninto operation until Parliament has had the fullest opportunity, by an\r\nAmending Bill, of altering, modifying, or qualifying its provisions in\r\nsuch a way as to secure the general consent both of Ireland and of the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\" The Prime Minister, further, paid a tribute to \"the\r\npatriotic and public spirit which had been shown by the Ulster\r\nVolunteers,\" whose conduct has made \"the employment of force, any kind\r\nof force, for what you call the coercion of Ulster, an absolutely\r\nunthinkable thing.\"\r\n\r\nBut a verbal acknowledgment of the public spirit shown by the U.V.F. in\r\nthe first month of the war was a paltry recompense for the Government's\r\nbreach of faith, as Mr. Bonar Law immediately pointed out in a stinging\r\nrejoinder. The leader of the Opposition concluded his powerful\r\nindictment by saying that such conduct by the Government could not be\r\nallowed to pass without protest, but that at such a moment of national\r\ndanger debate in Parliament on this domestic quarrel, forced upon them\r\nby Ministers, was indecent; and that, having made his protest, neither\r\nhe nor his party would take further part in that indecency. Thereupon\r\nthe whole Unionist Party followed Mr. Bonar Law out of the Chamber.\r\n\r\nBut that was not the end of the incident. It had been decided, with Sir\r\nEdward Carson's approval, that \"Ulster Day,\" the second anniversary of\r\nthe Covenant, should be celebrated in Ulster by special religious\r\nservices. The intention had been to focus attention on the larger\r\naspects of Imperial instead of local patriotism; but what had just\r\noccurred in Parliament could not be ignored, and it necessitated a\r\nreaffirmation of Ulster's unchanged attitude in the domestic quarrel.\r\nMr. Bonar Law now determined to accompany Sir Edward Carson to Belfast\r\nto renew and to amplify under these circumstances the pledges of British\r\nUnionists to Ulster.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was a memorable one in several respects. On the 17th of\r\nSeptember Sir Edward Carson had been quietly married in the country to\r\nMiss Frewen, and he was accompanied to Belfast a few days later by the\r\nnew Lady Carson, who then made acquaintance with Ulster and her\r\nhusband's followers for the first time. The scenes that invariably\r\nmarked the leader's arrival from England have been already described;\r\nbut the presence of his wife led to a more exuberant welcome than ever\r\non this occasion; and the recent Parliamentary storm, with its sequel in\r\nthe visit of the leader of the Unionist Party, contributed further to\r\nthe unbounded enthusiasm of the populace.\r\n\r\nThere was a meeting of the Council on the morning of the 28th, Ulster\r\nDay, at which Carson told the whole story of the conferences,\r\nnegotiations, conversations, and what not, that had been going on up to,\r\nand even since, the outbreak of war, in the course of which he observed\r\nthat, if he had committed any fault, \"it was that he believed the Prime\r\nMinister.\" He paid a just tribute to Mr. Bonar Law, whose constancy,\r\npatience, and \"resolution to be no party even under these difficult\r\ncircumstances to anything that would be throwing over Ulster, were\r\nmatters which would be photographed upon his mind to the very end of his\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nBut while, naturally, resentment at the conduct of the Government found\r\nforcible expression, and the policy that would be pursued \"after the\r\nwar\" was outlined, the keynote of the speeches at this Council Meeting,\r\nand also at the overwhelming demonstration addressed by Mr. Bonar Law in\r\nthe Ulster Hall in the evening, was \"country before party.\" As the\r\nUnionist leader truly said: \"This is not an anti-Home Rule meeting. That\r\ncan wait, and you are strong enough to let it wait with quiet\r\nconfidence.\" But before passing to the great issues raised by the war,\r\nintroduced by a telling allusion to the idea that Germany had calculated\r\non Ulster being a thorn in England's side, Mr. Bonar Law gave the\r\nmessage to Ulster which he had specially crossed the Channel to deliver\r\nin person.\r\n\r\nHe reminded the audience that hitherto the promise of support to Ulster\r\nby the Unionists of Great Britain, given long before at Blenheim, had\r\nbeen coupled with the condition that, if an appeal were made to the\r\nelectorate, the Unionist Party would bow to the verdict of the country.\r\n\"But now,\" he went on, \"after the way in which advantage has been taken\r\nof your patriotism, I say to you, and I say it with the full authority\r\nof our party, we give the pledge without any condition.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the two days which he spent in Belfast Mr. Bonar Law, and other\r\nvisitors from England, paid visits to the training camps at Newcastle\r\nand Ballykinler, where the 1st Brigade of the Ulster Division was\r\nundergoing training for the front. Both now, and for some time to come,\r\nthere was a good deal of unworthy political jealousy of the Division,\r\nwhich showed itself in a tendency to belittle the recruiting figures\r\nfrom Ulster, and in sneers in the Nationalist Press at the delay in\r\nsending to the front a body of troops whose friends had advertised their\r\nsupposed efficiency before the war. These troops were themselves\r\nfretting to get to France; and they believed, rightly or wrongly, that\r\npolitical intrigue was at work to keep them ingloriously at home, while\r\nother Divisions, lacking their preliminary training, were receiving\r\npreference in the supply of equipment.\r\n\r\nOne small circumstance, arising out of the conditions in which\r\n\"Kitchener's Army\" had to be raised, afforded genuine enjoyment in\r\nUlster. Men were enlisting far more rapidly than the factories could\r\nprovide arms, uniforms, and other equipment. Rifles for teaching the\r\nrecruits to drill and manoeuvre were a long way short of requirements.\r\nIt was a great joy to the Ulstermen when the War Office borrowed their\r\nmuch-ridiculed \"dummy rifles\" and \"wooden guns,\" and took them to\r\nEnglish training camps for use by the \"New Army.\"\r\n\r\nBut this volume is not concerned with the conduct of the Great War, nor\r\nis it necessary to enter in detail into the controversy that arose as to\r\nthe efforts of the rest of Ireland, in comparison with those of Ulster,\r\nto serve the Empire in the hour of need. It will be sufficient to cite\r\nthe testimony of two authorities, neither of whom can be suspected of\r\nbias on the side of Ulster. The chronicler of the _Annual Register_\r\nrecords that:\r\n\r\n     \"In Ulster, as in England, the flow of recruits outran the\r\n     provision made for them by the War Office, and by about the middle\r\n     of October the Protestant districts had furnished some 21,000, of\r\n     which Belfast alone had contributed 7,581, or 305 per 10,000 of the\r\n     population--the highest proportion of all the towns in the United\r\n     Kingdom.\"[91]\r\n\r\nThe second witness is the democratic orator who took a foremost part in\r\nthe House of Commons in denouncing the Curragh officers who resigned\r\ntheir Commissions rather than march against Ulster. Colonel John Ward,\r\nM.P., writing two years after the war, in which he had not kept his eyes\r\nshut, said:\r\n\r\n     \"It would be presumptuous for a mere Englishman to praise the\r\n     gallantry and patriotism of Scotland, Wales, and Ulster; their\r\n     record stands second to none in the annals of the war. The case of\r\n     the South of Ireland, her most ardent admirer will admit, is not\r\n     as any other in the whole British Empire. To the everlasting credit\r\n     of the great leader of the Irish Nationalists, Mr. John Redmond,\r\n     his gallant son, and his very lovable brother--together with many\r\n     real, great-souled Irish soldiers whose loss we so deeply\r\n     deplore--saw the light and followed the only course open to good\r\n     men and true. But the patriotism and devotion of the few only show\r\n     up in greater and more exaggerated contrast the sullen indifference\r\n     of the majority, and the active hostility of the minority, who\r\n     would have seen our country and its people overrun and defeated not\r\n     only without regret, but with fiendish delight.\"[92]\r\n\r\nNo generous-minded Ulsterman would wish to detract a word from the\r\ntribute paid by Colonel Ward to the Redmond family and other gallant\r\nCatholic Nationalists who stood manfully for the Empire in the day of\r\ntrial; but the concluding sentence in the above quotation cannot be\r\ngainsaid. And the pathetic thing was that Mr. Redmond himself never\r\nseems to have understood the true sentiments of the majority of those\r\nwho had been his followers before the war. In a speech in the House on\r\nthe 15th of September he referred contemptuously to a \"little group of\r\nmen who never belonged to the National Constitutional party, who were\r\ncirculating anti-recruiting handbills and were publishing little\r\nwretched rags once a week or once a month,\" which were not worth a\r\nmoment's notice.\r\n\r\nThe near future was to show that these adherents of Sinn Fein were not\r\nso negligible as Mr. Redmond sincerely believed. The real fact was that\r\nhis own patriotic attitude at the outbreak of war undermined his\r\nleadership in Ireland. The \"separatism\" which had always been, as Ulster\r\nnever ceased to believe, the true underlying, though not always the\r\nacknowledged, motive power of Irish Nationalism, was beginning again to\r\nassert itself, and to find expression in \"handbills\" and \"wretched\r\nrags.\" It was discovering other leaders and spokesmen than Mr. Redmond\r\nand his party, whom it was destined before long to sweep utterly away.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[90] _Morning Post_, May 19th, 1913.\r\n\r\n[91] _The Annual Register_, 1914, p. 259.\r\n\r\n[92] \"The Army and Ireland,\" _Nineteenth Century and After_, January\r\n1921, by Lieut.-Colonel John Ward, C.B., C.M.G., M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nNEGOTIATIONS FOR SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe position in which Ulster was now placed was, from the political\r\npoint of view, a very anxious one. Had the war not broken out when it\r\ndid, there was a very prevalent belief that the Government could not\r\nhave avoided a general election either before, or immediately after, the\r\nplacing of Home Rule on the Statute-book; and as to the result of such\r\nan election no Unionist had any misgiving. Even if the Government had\r\nremained content to disregard the electorate, it would have been\r\nimpossible for them to subject Ulster to a Dublin Parliament. The\r\norganisation there was powerful enough to prevent it, by force if\r\nnecessary, and the Curragh Incident had proved that the Army could not\r\nbe employed against the Loyalists.\r\n\r\nBut the whole outlook had now changed. The war had put off all thought\r\nof a General Election till an indefinite future; the Ulster Volunteers,\r\nand every other wheel in the very effective machinery prepared for\r\nresistance to Home Rule, were now diverted to a wholly different\r\npurpose; and at the same time the hated Bill had become an Act, and the\r\nonly alleviation was the promise, for what it might be worth, of an\r\nAmending Bill the scope of which remained undefined. While, therefore,\r\nthe Ulster leaders and people threw themselves with all their energy\r\ninto the patriotic work to which the war gave the call, the situation so\r\ncreated at home caused them much uneasiness.\r\n\r\nNo one felt it more than Lord Londonderry. Indeed, as the autumn of 1914\r\nwore on, the despondency he fell into was so marked that his friends\r\ncould not avoid disquietude on his personal account in addition to all\r\nthe other grounds for anxiety. He and Lady Londonderry, it is true, took\r\na leading part in all the activities to which the war gave rise\r\n--encouraging recruiting, organising hospitals, and making provision of\r\nevery kind for soldiers and their dependents, in Ulster and in the\r\nCounty of Durham. But when in London in November, Lord Londonderry would\r\nsit moodily at the Carlton Club, speaking to few except intimate\r\nfriends, and apparently overcome by depression. He was pessimistic about\r\nthe war. His only son was at the front, and he seemed persuaded he would\r\nnever return. The affairs of Ulster, to which he had given his whole\r\nheart, looked black; and he went about as if all his purpose in life was\r\ngone. He went with Lady Londonderry to Mount Stewart for Christmas, and\r\none or two intimate friends who visited him there in January 1915 were\r\ngreatly disturbed in mind on his account. But the public in Belfast, who\r\nsaw him going in and out of the Ulster Club as usual, did not know\r\nanything was amiss, and were terribly shocked as well as grieved when\r\nthey heard of his sudden death at Wynyard on the 8th of February.\r\n\r\nThe death of Lord Londonderry was felt by many thousands in Ulster as a\r\npersonal bereavement. If he did not arouse the unbounded, and almost\r\ndelirious, devotion which none but Sir Edward Carson ever evoked in the\r\nNorth of Ireland, the deep respect and warm affection felt towards him\r\nby all who knew him, and by great numbers who did not, was a tribute\r\nwhich his modesty and integrity of character and genial friendliness of\r\ndisposition richly deserved. He was faithfully described by Carson\r\nhimself to the Ulster Unionist Council several months after his death as\r\n\"a great leader, a great and devoted public servant, a great patriot, a\r\ngreat gentleman, and above all the greatest of great friends.\"\r\n\r\nUlster, meantime, had already had a foretaste of the sacrifices the war\r\nwas to demand when the Division should go to the front. In November 1914\r\nCaptain the Hon. Arthur O'Neill, M.P. for Mid Antrim, who had gone to\r\nthe front with the first expeditionary force, was killed in action in\r\nFrance. There was a certain sense of sad pride in the reflection that\r\nthe first member of the House of Commons to give his life for King and\r\ncountry was a representative of Ulster; and the constituency which\r\nsuffered the loss of a promising young member by the death of this\r\ngallant Life Guardsman consoled itself by electing in his place his\r\nyounger brother, Major Hugh O'Neill, then serving in the Ulster\r\nDivision, who afterwards proved himself a most valuable member of the\r\nUlster Parliamentary Party, and eventually became the first Speaker of\r\nthe Ulster Parliament created by the Act of 1920.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the bitter outbreak of party passion caused by the\r\nGovernment's action in putting the Home Rule Bill on the Statute-book in\r\nSeptember, the party truce was well maintained throughout the autumn and\r\nwinter. And the most striking proof of the transformation wrought by the\r\nwar was seen when Mr. Asquith, when constrained to form a truly national\r\nAdministration in May 1915, included Sir Edward Carson in his Cabinet\r\nwith the office of Attorney-General. Mr. Redmond was at the same time\r\ninvited to join the Government, and his refusal to do so when the\r\nBritish Unionists, the Labour leaders, and the Ulster leaders all\r\nresponded to the Prime Minister's appeal to their patriotism, did not\r\nappear in the eyes of Ulstermen to confirm the Nationalist leader's\r\nprofession of loyalty to the Empire; though they did him the justice of\r\nbelieving that he would have accepted office if he had felt free to\r\nfollow his own inclination. His inability to do so, and the complaints\r\nof his followers, including Mr. Dillon, at the admission of Carson to\r\nthe Cabinet, revealed the incapacity of the Nationalists to rise to a\r\nlevel above party.\r\n\r\nCarson, however, did not remain very long in the Government.\r\nDisapproving of the policy pursued in relation to our Allies in the\r\nBalkans, he resigned on the 20th of October, 1915. But he had remained\r\nlong enough to prove his value in council to the most energetic of his\r\ncolleagues in the Cabinet. Men like Mr. Churchill and Mr. Lloyd George,\r\nalthough they had been the bitterest of Carson's opponents eighteen\r\nmonths previously, seldom omitted from this time forward to seek his\r\nadvice in times of difficulty; and the latter of these two, when things\r\nwere going badly with the Allies more than a year later, endeavoured to\r\npersuade Mr. Asquith to include Carson in a Committee of four to be\r\ncharged with the entire conduct of the war.\r\n\r\nIt was, perhaps, fortunate that the Ulster leader was not a member of\r\nthe Government when the rebellion broke out in the South of Ireland at\r\nEaster 1916. For this event suddenly brought to the front again the\r\nwhole Home Rule question, which everybody had hoped might be allowed to\r\nsleep till the end of the war; and it would have been a misfortune if\r\nCarson had not then been in a position of independence to play his part\r\nin this new act of the Irish drama.\r\n\r\nThe Government had many warnings of what was brewing. But Mr. Birrell,\r\nthe Chief Secretary, who in frivolity seemed a contemporary embodiment\r\nof Nero, deemed cheap wit a sufficient reply to all remonstrances, and\r\nhad to confess afterwards that he had utterly miscalculated the forces\r\nwith which he had to deal. He was completely taken by surprise when, on\r\nthe 20th of April, an attempt to land weapons from a German vessel,\r\nescorted by a submarine from which Sir Roger Casement landed in the West\r\nof Ireland, proved that the Irish rebels were in league with the enemy;\r\nand even after this ominous event, he did nothing to provide against the\r\noutbreak that occurred in Dublin four days later. The rising in the\r\ncapital, and in several other places in the South of Ireland, was not\r\ngot under for a week, during which time more than 170 houses had been\r\nburnt, £2,000,000 sterling worth of property destroyed or damaged, and\r\n1,315 casualties had been suffered, of which 304 were fatal.\r\n\r\nThe aims of the insurgents were disclosed in a proclamation which\r\nreferred to the administration in Ireland as a \"long usurpation by a\r\nforeign people and government.\" It declared that the Irish Republican\r\nBrotherhood--the same organisation that planned and carried out the\r\nPhoenix Park murders in 1882--had now seized the right moment for\r\n\"reviving the old traditions of Irish nationhood,\" and announced that\r\nthe new Irish Republic was a sovereign independent State, which was\r\nentitled to claim the allegiance of every Irish man and woman.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion was the subject of debates in both Houses of Parliament on\r\nthe 10th and 11th of May--Mr. Birrell having in the interval, to use a\r\nphrase of Carlyle's, \"taken himself and his incompetence\r\nelsewhere\"--when Mr. Dillon, speaking for the Nationalist Party, poured\r\nforth a flood of passionate sympathy with the rebels, declaring that he\r\nwas proud of youths who could boast of having slaughtered British\r\nsoldiers, and he denounced the Government for suppressing the rising in\r\n\"a sea of blood.\" The actual fact was, that out of a large number of\r\nprisoners taken red-handed in the act of armed rebellion who were\r\ncondemned to death after trial by court-martial, the great majority were\r\nreprieved, and thirteen in all were executed. Whether such measures\r\ndeserved the frightful description coined by Mr. Dillon's flamboyant\r\nrhetoric everybody can judge for himself, after considering whether in\r\nany other country or at any other period of the world's history, active\r\nassistance of a foreign enemy--for that is what it amounted to--has been\r\nvisited with a more lenient retribution.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that Mr. Dillon thus justified the whole basis of\r\nUlster's unchanging attitude towards Nationalism by blurting out his\r\nsympathy with England's enemies, Mr. Asquith announced that he was\r\nhimself going to Ireland to investigate matters on the spot. These two\r\nevents, Mr. Dillon's speech and the Prime Minister's visit to\r\nDublin--where he certainly exhibited no stern anger against the rebels,\r\neven if the stories were exaggerated which reported him to have shown\r\nthem ostentatious friendliness--went far to transform what had been a\r\nwretched fiasco into a success. Cowed at first by their complete\r\nfailure, the rebels found encouragement in the complacency of the Prime\r\nMinister, and the fear or sympathy, whichever it was, of the Nationalist\r\nParty. From that moment they rapidly increased in influence, until they\r\nproved two years later that they had become the predominant power all\r\nover Ireland except in Ulster.\r\n\r\nIn Ulster the rebellion was regarded with mixed feelings. The strongest\r\nsentiment was one of horror at the treacherous blow dealt to the Empire\r\nwhile engaged in a life-and-death struggle with a foreign enemy. But,\r\nwas it unpardonably Pharisaic if there was also some self-glorification\r\nin the thought that Ulstermen in this respect were not as other men\r\nwere? There was also a prevalent feeling that after what had occurred\r\nthey would hear no more of Home Rule, at any rate during the war. It\r\nappeared inconceivable that any sane Government could think of handing\r\nover the control of Ireland in time of war to people who had just proved\r\ntheir active hostility to Great Britain in so unmistakable a fashion.\r\n\r\nBut they were soon undeceived. Mr. Asquith, on his return, told the\r\nHouse of Commons what he had learnt during his few days' sojourn in\r\nIreland. His first proposition was that the existing machinery of\r\nGovernment in Ireland had completely broken down. That was undeniable.\r\nIt was the natural fruit of the Birrell regime. Mr. Asquith was himself\r\nresponsible for it. But no more strange or illogical conclusion could be\r\ndrawn from it than that which Mr. Asquith proceeded to propound. This\r\nwas that there was now \"a unique opportunity for a new departure for the\r\nsettlement of outstanding problems \"--which, when translated from\r\nAsquithian into plain English, meant that now was the time for Home\r\nRule. The pledge to postpone the question till after the war was to be\r\nswept aside, and, instead of building up by sound and sensible\r\nadministration what Mr. Birrel's abnegation of government had allowed to\r\ncrumble into \"breakdown,\" the rebels were to be rewarded for traffic\r\nwith the enemy and destruction of the central parts of Dublin, with\r\ngreat loss of life, by being allowed to point to the triumphant success\r\nof their activity, which was certain to prove the most effective of all\r\npossible propaganda for their political ideals in Ireland.\r\n\r\nSome regard, however, was still to be paid to the promise of an Amending\r\nBill. The Prime Minister repeated that no one contemplated the coercion\r\nof Ulster; that an attempt must be made to come to agreement about the\r\nterms on which the Home Rule Act could be brought into immediate\r\noperation; and that the Cabinet had deputed to Mr. Lloyd George the task\r\nof negotiating to this end with both parties in Ireland. Accordingly,\r\nMr. Lloyd George, then Secretary of State for War, interviewed Sir\r\nEdward Carson on the one hand and Mr. Redmond and Mr. Devlin on the\r\nother, and submitted to them separately the proposals which he said the\r\nCabinet were prepared to make.[93]\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of June Carson explained the Cabinet's proposals at a special\r\nmeeting of the Ulster Unionist Council held in private. His task was an\r\nextremely difficult one, for the advice he had to offer was utterly\r\ndetestable to himself, and he knew it would be no less so to his\r\nhearers. And the latter, profound as was their trust in him as their\r\nleader, were men of singularly independent judgment and quite capable of\r\nrespectfully declining to take any course they did not themselves\r\napprove. Indeed, Carson emphasised the fact that he could not, and had\r\nnot attempted to, bind the Council to take the same view of the\r\nsituation as himself. At the same time he clearly and frankly stated\r\nwhat his own opinion was, saying: \"I would indeed be a poor leader of a\r\ngreat movement if I hesitated to express my own views of any proposition\r\nput before you.\"[94]\r\n\r\nHis speech, which took nearly two hours in delivery, was a perfect model\r\nof lucid exposition and convincing argument. He reviewed in close detail\r\nthe course of events that had led to the present situation. He\r\nmaintained from first to last the highest ground of patriotism.\r\nMentioning that numerous correspondents had asked why he did not\r\nchallenge the Nationalist professions of loyalty two years before at the\r\nbeginning of the war, which had since then been so signally falsified,\r\nhe answered:\r\n\r\n     \"Because I had no desire to show a dissentient Ireland to the\r\n     Germans. I am glad, even with what has happened, that we played the\r\n     game, and if we had to do it again we would play the game. And then\r\n     suddenly came the rebellion in Dublin. I cannot find words to\r\n     describe my own horror when I heard of it. For I am bound to admit\r\n     to you that I was not thinking merely of Ulster; I was thinking of\r\n     the war; I was thinking, as I am always thinking, of what will\r\n     happen if we are beaten in the war. I was thinking of the\r\n     sacrifice of human lives at the front, and in Gallipoli, and at\r\n     Kut, when suddenly I heard that the whole thing was interrupted by,\r\n     forsooth, an Irish rebellion--by what Mr. Dillon in the House of\r\n     Commons called a clean fight! It is not Ulster or Ireland that is\r\n     now at stake: it is the British Empire. We have therefore to\r\n     consider not merely a local problem, but a great Imperial\r\n     problem--how to win the war.\"\r\n\r\nHe then outlined the representations that had been made to him by the\r\nCabinet as to the injury to the Allied cause resulting from the\r\nunsettled Irish question--the disturbance of good relations with the\r\nUnited States, whence we were obtaining vast quantities of munitions;\r\nthe bad effect of our local differences on opinion in Allied and neutral\r\ncountries. He admitted that these evil effects were largely due to false\r\nand hostile propaganda to which the British Government weakly neglected\r\nto provide an antidote; he believed they were grossly exaggerated. But\r\nin time of war they could not contend with their own Government nor be\r\ndeaf to its appeals, especially when that Government contained all their\r\nown party leaders, on whose support they had hitherto leaned.\r\n\r\nOne of Carson's chief difficulties was to make men grasp the\r\nsignificance of the fact that Home Rule was now actually established by\r\nAct of Parliament. The point that the Act was on the Statute-book was\r\nconstantly lost sight of, with all that it implied. He drove home the\r\nunwelcome truth that simple repeal of that Act was not practical\r\npolitics. The only hope for Ulster to escape going under a Parliament in\r\nDublin lay in the promised Amending Bill. But they had no assurance how\r\nmuch that Bill, when produced, would do for them. Was it likely, he\r\nasked, to do more than was now offered by the Government?\r\n\r\nHe then told the Council what Mr. Lloyd George's proposals were. The\r\nCabinet offered on the one hand a \"clean cut,\" not indeed of the whole\r\nof Ulster, but of the six most Protestant counties, and on the other to\r\nbring the Home Rule Act, so modified, into immediate operation. He\r\npointed out that none of them could contemplate using the U.V.F. for\r\nfighting purposes at home after the war; and that, even if such a thing\r\nwere thinkable, they could not expect to get more by forcible resistance\r\nto the Act than what was now offered by legislation.\r\n\r\nBut to Carson himself, and to all who listened to him that day, the\r\nheartrending question was whether they could suffer a separation to be\r\nmade between the Loyalists in the six counties and those in the other\r\nthree counties of the Province. It could only be done, Carson declared,\r\nif, after considering all the circumstances of the case as he unfolded\r\nit to them, the delegates from Cavan, Monaghan, and Donegal could make\r\nthe self-sacrifice of releasing the other counties from the obligation\r\nto stand or fall together. Carson ended by saying that he did not intend\r\nto take a vote--he \"could be no party to having Ulstermen vote one\r\nagainst the other.\" What was to be done must be done by agreement, or\r\nnot at all. He offered to confer separately with the delegates from the\r\nthree omitted counties, and the Council adjourned till the 12th of June\r\nto enable this conference to be held.\r\n\r\nIn the interval a large number of the delegates held meetings of their\r\nlocal associations, most of which passed resolutions in favour of\r\naccepting the Government's proposals. But there was undoubtedly a\r\nwidespread feeling that it would be a betrayal of the Loyalists of\r\nCavan, Monaghan, and Donegal, and even a positive breach of the\r\nCovenant, to accept exclusion from the Home Rule Act for only a portion\r\nof Ulster. This was, it is true, a misunderstanding of the strict\r\nmeaning of the Covenant, which had been expressly conditioned so as not\r\nto extend to such unforeseen circumstances as the war had brought\r\nabout[95]; but there was a general desire to avoid if possible taking\r\ntechnical points, and both Carson himself and the Council were ready to\r\nsacrifice the opportunity for a tolerable settlement should the\r\nrepresentatives of the three counties not freely consent to what was\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\nIn a spirit of self-sacrifice which deeply touched every member of the\r\nCouncil, this consent was given. Carson had obtained leave for Lord\r\nFarnham to return from the Army in France to be present at the meeting.\r\nLord Farnham, as a delegate from Cavan, made a speech at the adjourned\r\nmeeting on the 12th which filled his hearers with admiration. That he\r\nwas almost heart-broken by the turn events had taken he made no attempt\r\nto conceal; and his distress was shared by those who heard his moving\r\nwords. But he showed that he possessed the instinct of statesmanship\r\nwhich compelled him to recognise, in spite of the powerful pull of\r\nsentiment and self-interest in the opposite direction, that the course\r\nrecommended by Carson was the path of wisdom. With breaking voice he\r\nthanked the latter \"for the clearness, and the fairness, and the\r\nmanliness with which he has put the deplorable situation that has arisen\r\nbefore us, and for his manly advice as leader \"; and he then read a\r\nresolution that had been passed earlier in the day by the delegates of\r\nthe three counties, which, after recording a protest against any\r\nsettlement excluding them from Ulster, expressed sorrowful acquiescence,\r\non grounds of the larger patriotism, in whatever decision might be come\r\nto in the matter by their colleagues from the six counties.\r\n\r\nIt was the saddest hour the Ulster Unionist Council ever spent. Men not\r\nprone to emotion shed tears. It was the most poignant ordeal the Ulster\r\nleader ever passed through. But it was just one of those occasions when\r\nfar-seeing statesmanship demands the ruthless silencing of promptings\r\nthat spring from emotion. Many of those who on that terrible 12th of\r\nJune were most torn by doubt as to the necessity for the decision\r\narrived at, realised before long that their leader had never been guided\r\nby surer insight than in the counsel he gave them that day.\r\n\r\nThe Resolution adopted by the Council was a lengthy one. After reciting\r\nthe unaltered attachment of Ulster to the Union, it placed on record the\r\nappeal that had been made by the Government on patriotic grounds for a\r\nsettlement of the Irish difficulty, which the Council did not think it\r\nright at such a time of national emergency to resist; but it was careful\r\nto reserve, in case the negotiations should break down from any other\r\ncause, complete freedom to revert to \"opposition to the whole policy of\r\nHome Rule for Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the Nationalist leaders had been submitting Mr. Lloyd George's\r\nproposals to their own people, and on the 10th of June Mr. Redmond made\r\na speech in Dublin from which it appeared that he was submitting a very\r\ndifferent proposal to that explained by Carson in Belfast. For Mr.\r\nRedmond told his Dublin audience that, while the Home Rule Act was to\r\ncome into operation at once, the exclusion of the six counties was to be\r\nonly for the period of the war and twelve months afterwards. That would,\r\nof course, have been even less favourable to Ulster than the terms\r\noffered by Mr. Asquith and rejected by Carson in March 1914. Exclusion\r\nfor the period of the war meant nothing; it would have been useless to\r\nUlster; it was no concession whatever; and Carson would have refused, as\r\nhe did in 1914, even to submit it to the Unionist Council in Belfast.\r\nMr. Lloyd George, who must have known this, had told him quite clearly\r\nthat there was to be a \"definite clean cut,\" with no suggestion of a\r\ntime limit. There was, however, an idea that after the war an Imperial\r\nConference would be held, at which the whole constitutional relations of\r\nthe component nations of the British Empire would be reviewed, and that\r\nthe permanent status of Ireland would then come under reconsideration\r\nwith the rest. In this sense the arrangement now proposed was spoken of\r\nas \"provisional\"; but both Mr. Lloyd George and the Prime Minister made\r\nit perfectly plain that the proposed exclusion of the six Ulster\r\ncounties from Home Rule could never be reversed except by a fresh Act of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nBut when the question was raised by Mr. Redmond in the House of Commons\r\non the 24th of July, in a speech of marked moderation, he explained that\r\nhe had understood the exclusion, like all the rest of the scheme, to be\r\nstrictly \"provisional,\" with the consequence that it would come to an\r\nend automatically at the end of the specified period unless prolonged by\r\nnew legislation; and he refused to respond to an earnest appeal by Mr.\r\nAsquith not to let slip this opportunity of obtaining, with the consent\r\nof the Unionist Party, immediate Home Rule for the greater part of\r\nIreland, more especially as Mr. Redmond himself had disclaimed any\r\ndesire to bring Ulster within the Home Rule jurisdiction without her own\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations for settlement thus fell to the ground, and the bitter\r\nsacrifice which Ulster had brought herself to offer, in response to the\r\nGovernment's urgent appeal, bore no fruit, unless it was to afford one\r\nmore proof of her loyalty to England and the Empire. She was to find\r\nthat such proofs were for the most part thrown away, and merely were\r\nused by her enemies, and by some who professed to be her friends, as a\r\nstarting-point for demands on her for further concessions. But, although\r\nall British parties in turn did their best to impress upon Ulster that\r\nloyalty did not pay, she never succeeded in learning the lesson\r\nsufficiently to be guided by it in her political conduct.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[93] Mr. Lloyd George's memory was at fault when he said in the House of\r\nCommons on the 7th of February, 1922, that on the occasion referred to\r\nin the text he had seen Sir Edward Carson and Mr. Redmond together.\r\n\r\n[94] The quotations from this speech, which was never published, are\r\nfrom a report privately taken by the Ulster Unionist Council.\r\n\r\n[95] See _ante_, p. 105.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH CONVENTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of Mr. Lloyd George's negotiations for settlement in\r\nthe summer of 1916 the Nationalists practically dropped all pretence of\r\nhelping the Government to carry on the war. They were, no doubt,\r\nbeginning to realise how completely they were losing hold of the people\r\nof Southern Ireland, and that the only chance of regaining their\r\nvanishing popularity was by an attitude of hostility to the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nFrequently during the autumn and winter they raised debates in\r\nParliament on the demand that the Home Rule Act should immediately come\r\ninto operation, and threatened that if this were not done recruits from\r\nIreland would not be forthcoming, although the need for men was now a\r\nmatter of great national urgency. They ignored the fact that Mr. Redmond\r\nwas a consenting party to Mr. Asquith's policy of holding Home Rule in\r\nabeyance till after the war, and attempted to explain away their own\r\nloss of influence in Ireland by alleging that the exasperation of the\r\nIrish people at the delay in obtaining \"self-government\" was the cause\r\nof their alienation from England, and of the growth of Sinn Fein.\r\n\r\nIn December 1916 the Asquith Government came to an end, and Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge became Prime Minister. He had shown his estimate of Sir Edward\r\nCarson's statesmanship by pressing Mr. Asquith to entrust the entire\r\nconduct of the war to a Committee of four, of whom the Ulster leader\r\nshould be one; and, having failed in this attempt to infuse energy and\r\ndecision into the counsels of his Chief, he turned him out and formed a\r\nMinistry with Carson in the office of First Lord of the Admiralty, at\r\nthat time one of the most vital in the Government. Colonel James Craig\r\nalso joined the Ministry as Treasurer of the Household.\r\n\r\nThe change of Government did nothing to alter the attitude of the\r\nNationalists, unless, indeed, the return of Carson to high office added\r\nto the fierceness of their attacks. On the 26th of February 1917--just\r\nwhen \"unrestricted submarine warfare\" was bringing the country into its\r\ngreatest peril--Mr. Dillon called upon the Government to release\r\ntwenty-eight men who had been deported from Ireland, and who were\r\ndeclared by Mr. Duke, the Chief Secretary, to have been deeply\r\nimplicated in the Easter rebellion of the previous year; and a week\r\nlater Mr. T.P. O'Connor returned to the charge with another demand for\r\nHome Rule without further ado.\r\n\r\nThe debate on Mr. O'Connor's motion on the 7th of March was made\r\nmemorable by the speech of Major William Redmond, home on leave from the\r\ntrenches in France, whose sincere and impassioned appeal for oblivion of\r\nold historic quarrels between Irish Catholics and Protestants, who were\r\nat that moment fighting and dying side by side in France, made a deep\r\nimpression on the House of Commons and the country. And when this\r\ngallant officer fell in action not long afterwards and was carried out\r\nof the firing line by Ulster soldiers, his speech on the 7th of March\r\nwas recalled and made the peg on which to hang many adjurations to\r\nUlster to come into line with their Nationalist fellow-countrymen of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nSuch appeals revealed a curious inability to grasp the realities of the\r\nsituation. Men spoke and wrote as if it were something new and wonderful\r\nfor Irishmen of the \"two nations\" to be found fighting side by side in\r\nthe British Army--as if the same thing had not been seen in the\r\nPeninsula, in the Crimea, on the Indian frontier, in South Africa, and\r\nin many another fight. Ulstermen, like everybody else who knew Major\r\nRedmond, deplored the loss of a very gallant officer and a very lovable\r\nman. But they could not understand why his death should be made a reason\r\nfor a change in their political convictions. When Major Arthur O'Neill,\r\nan Ulster member, was killed in action in 1914, no one had suggested\r\nthat Nationalists should on that account turn Unionists. Why, they\r\nwondered, should Unionists any more turn Nationalists because a\r\nNationalist M.P. had made the same supreme sacrifice? All this\r\nsentimental talk of that time was founded on the misconception that\r\nUlster's attachment to the Union was the result of personal prejudice\r\nagainst Catholics of the South, instead of being, as it was, a\r\ndeliberate and reasoned conviction as to the best government for\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThis distinction was clearly brought out in the same debate by Sir John\r\nLonsdale, who, when Carson became a member of the Cabinet, had been\r\nelected leader of the Ulster Party in the House of Commons; and an\r\nemphatic pronouncement, which went to the root of the controversy, was\r\nmade in reply to the Nationalists by the Prime Minister. In the\r\nnorth-eastern portion of Ireland, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"You have a population as hostile to Irish rule as the rest of\r\n     Ireland is to British rule, yea, and as ready to rebel against it\r\n     as the rest of Ireland is against British rule--as alien in blood,\r\n     in religious faith, in traditions, in outlook--as alien from the\r\n     rest of Ireland in this respect as the inhabitants of Fife or\r\n     Aberdeen. To place them under National rule against their will\r\n     would be as glaring an outrage on the principles of liberty and\r\n     self-government as the denial of self-government would be for the\r\n     rest of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government were, therefore, prepared, said Mr. Lloyd George, to\r\nbring in Home Rule immediately for that part of Ireland that wanted it,\r\nbut not for the Northern part which did not want it. Mr. Redmond made a\r\nfine display of indignation at this refusal to coerce Ulster; and, in\r\nimitation of the Unionists in 1914, marched out of the House at the head\r\nof his party. Next day he issued a manifesto to men of Irish blood in\r\nthe United States and in the Dominions, calling on them to use all means\r\nin their power to exert pressure on the British Government. It was clear\r\nthat this sort of thing could not be tolerated in the middle of a war in\r\nwhich Great Britain was fighting for her life, and at a crisis in it\r\nwhen her fortunes were far from prosperous. Accordingly, on the 16th of\r\nMarch Mr. Bonar Law warned the Nationalists that their conduct might\r\nmake it necessary to appeal to the country on the ground that they were\r\nobstructing the prosecution of the war. But he also announced that the\r\nCabinet intended to make one more attempt to arrive at a settlement of\r\nthe apparently insoluble problem of Irish government.\r\n\r\nTwo months passed before it was made known how this attempt was to be\r\nmade. On the 16th of May the Prime Minister addressed a letter in\r\nduplicate to Mr. Redmond and Sir John Lonsdale, representing the two\r\nIrish parties respectively, in which he put forward for their\r\nconsideration two alternative methods of procedure, after premising that\r\nthe Government felt precluded from proposing during the war any measures\r\nexcept such as \"would be substantially accepted by both sides.\"\r\n\r\nThese alternatives were: _(a)_ a \"Bill for the immediate application of\r\nthe Home Rule Act to Ireland, but excluding therefrom the six counties\r\nof North-East Ulster,\" or, _(b)_ a Convention of Irishmen \"for the\r\npurpose of drafting a Constitution ... which should secure a just\r\nbalance of all the opposing interests.\" Sir John Lonsdale replied to the\r\nPrime Minister that he would take the Government's first proposal to\r\nBelfast for consideration by the Council; but as Mr. Redmond, on the\r\nother hand, peremptorily refused to have anything to say to it, it\r\nbecame necessary to fall back on the other alternative, namely the\r\nassembling of an Irish Convention.\r\n\r\nThe members chosen to sit in the Convention were to be \"representative\r\nmen\" in Emerson's meaning of the words, but not in the democratic sense\r\nas deriving their authority from direct popular election. Certain\r\npolitical organisations and parties were each invited to nominate a\r\ncertain number; the Churches were represented by their leading clergy;\r\nmen occupying public positions, such as chairmen of local authorities,\r\nwere given _ex-officio_ seats; and a certain number were nominated by\r\nthe Government. The total membership of this variegated assembly was\r\nninety-five. The Sinn Fein party were invited to join, but refused to\r\nhave anything to do with it, declaring that they would consider nothing\r\nshort of complete independence for Ireland. The majority of the Irish\r\npeople thus stood aloof from the Convention altogether.\r\n\r\nAs the purpose for which the Convention was called was quickly lost\r\nsight of by many, and by none more than its Chairman, it is well to\r\nremember what that purpose was. If it had not been for the opposition of\r\nUlster, the Home Rule Act of 1914 would have been in force for years,\r\nand none of the many attempts at settlement would have been necessary.\r\nThe one and only thing required was to reconcile, if possible, the\r\naspirations of Ulster with those of the rest of Ireland. That was the\r\npurpose, and the only purpose, of the Convention; and in the letter\r\naddressed to Sir John Lonsdale equally with Mr. Redmond, the Prime\r\nMinister distinctly laid it down that unless its conclusions were\r\naccepted \"by both sides,\" nothing could come of it. To leave no shadow\r\nof doubt on this point Mr. Bonar Law, in reply to a specific question,\r\nsaid that there could be no \"substantial agreement\" to which Ulster was\r\nnot a party.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to emphasise this point, because for such a purpose the\r\nheterogeneous conglomeration of Nationalists of all shades that formed\r\nthe great majority of the Convention was worse than useless. The\r\nConvention was in reality a bi-lateral conference, in which one of the\r\ntwo sides was four times as numerous as the other. Yet much party\r\ncapital was subsequently made of the fact that the Nationalist members\r\nagreed upon a scheme of Home Rule--an achievement which had no element\r\nof the miraculous or even of the unexpected about it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that the Sinn Fein party had displayed their contempt\r\nfor the Convention, and under the delusion that it would \"create an\r\natmosphere of good-will\" for its meeting, the Government released\r\nwithout condition or reservation all the prisoners concerned in the\r\nEaster rebellion of 1916. It was like playing a penny whistle to\r\nconciliate a cobra. The prisoners, from whose minds nothing was further\r\nthan any thought of good-will to England, were received by the populace\r\nin Dublin with a rapturous ovation, their triumphal procession being\r\nheaded by Mr. De Valera, who was soon afterwards elected member for East\r\nClare by a majority of nearly thirty thousand. Four months later, the\r\nChief Secretary told Parliament that the young men of Southern Ireland,\r\nwho had refused to serve in the Army, were being enrolled in preparation\r\nfor another rebellion.\r\n\r\nIt was only after some hesitation that the Ulster Unionist Council\r\ndecided not to hold aloof from the Convention, as the Sinn Feiners did.\r\nCarson accompanied Sir John Lonsdale to Belfast and explained the\r\nexplicit pledges by Ministers that participation would not commit them\r\nto anything, that they would not be bound by any majority vote, and that\r\nwithout their concurrence no legislation was to be founded on any\r\nagreement between the other groups in the Convention; he also urged that\r\nUlster could not refuse to do what the Government held would be helpful\r\nin the prosecution of the war.\r\n\r\nThe invitation to nominate five delegates was therefore accepted; and\r\nwhen the membership of the Convention was complete there were nineteen\r\nout of ninety-five who could be reckoned as supporters in general of the\r\nUlster point of view. Among them were the Primate, the Moderator of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the Duke of Abercorn, the Marquis of Londonderry, Mr.\r\nH.M. Pollock, Chairman of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, one Labour\r\nrepresentative, Mr J. Hanna, and the Lord Mayors of Belfast and Derry.\r\nIt was agreed that Mr. H.T. Barrie, member for North Derry, should act\r\nas chairman and leader of the Ulster group, and he discharged this\r\ndifficult duty with unfailing tact and ability.\r\n\r\nThere was some difficulty in finding a suitable Chairman, for no party\r\nwas willing to accept any strong man opposed to their own views, while\r\nan impartial man was not to be found in Ireland. Eventually the choice\r\nfell on Sir Horace Plunkett as a gentleman who, if eagerly supported by\r\nnone, was accepted by each group as preferable to a more formidable\r\nopponent. Sir Horace made no pretence of impartiality. Whatever\r\ninfluence he possessed was used as a partisan of the Nationalists. He\r\nwas not, like the Speaker of the House of Commons, a silent guardian of\r\norder; he often harangued the assembly, which, on one occasion at least,\r\nhe addressed for over an hour; and he issued manifestos,\r\n_questionnaires_, and letters to members, one of which was sharply\r\ncensured as misleading both by Mr. Barrie and the Bishop of Raphoe.\r\n\r\nThe procedure adopted was described by the Chairman himself as\r\n\"unprecedented.\" It was not only that, but was unsuitable in the last\r\ndegree for the purpose in view. When it is borne in mind what that\r\npurpose was, it is clear that the only business-like method would have\r\nbeen to invite the Ulster delegates at the outset to formulate their\r\nobjections to coming under the Home Rule Act of 1914, and then to see\r\nwhether Mr. Redmond could make any concessions which would persuade\r\nUlster to accept something less than the permanent exclusion of six\r\ncounties, which had been their _minimum_ hitherto.\r\n\r\nThe procedure actually followed was ludicrously different. The object,\r\nas stated by the chairman, was \"to avoid raising contentious issues in\r\nsuch a way as to divide the Convention on party lines,\"[96] which, to\r\nsay the least, was a curious method of handling the most contentious\r\nproblem in British politics. A fine opportunity was offered to amateur\r\nconstitution-mongers. Anyone was allowed to propound a scheme for the\r\nfuture government of Ireland, which, of course, was an encouragement to\r\nendless wide-ranging debate, with the least conceivable likelihood of\r\narriving at definite decisions. Neither of the leaders of the two\r\nparties whose agreement was essential if the Convention was to have any\r\nresult took the initiative in bringing forward proposals. Mr. Redmond\r\nwas invited to do so, but declined. Mr. Barrie had no reason to do so,\r\nbecause the Ulster scheme for the government of Ireland was the\r\nlegislative union. So it was left to individuals with no official\r\nresponsibility to set forth their ideas, which became the subject of\r\nprotracted debates of a general character.\r\n\r\nIt was further arranged that while contentious issues--the only ones\r\nthat mattered--should be avoided, any conclusions reached on minor\r\nmatters should be purely provisional, and contingent on agreement being\r\ncome to ultimately on fundamentals. Month after month was spent in thus\r\ndiscussing such questions as the powers which an Irish Parliament ought\r\nto wield, while the question whether Ulster was to come into that\r\nParliament was left to stand over. Committees and sub-committees were\r\nappointed to thresh out these details, and some of them relieved the\r\ntedium by wandering into such interesting by-ways of irrelevancy as\r\nhousing and land purchase, all of which, in Gilbertian phrase, \"had\r\nnothing to do with the case.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ulster group raised no objection to all this expenditure of time and\r\nenergy. For they saw that it was not time wasted. From the standpoint of\r\nthe highest national interest it was, indeed, more useful than anything\r\nthe Convention could have accomplished by business-like methods. The\r\nsummer and autumn of 1917, and the early months of 1918, covered a\r\nterribly critical period of the war. The country was never in greater\r\nperil, and the attitude of the Nationalists in the House of Commons\r\nadded to the difficulties of the Government, as Mr. Bonar Law had\r\ncomplained in March. It was to placate them that the Convention had been\r\nsummoned. It was a bone thrown to a snarling dog, and the longer there\r\nwas anything to gnaw the longer would the dog keep quiet. The Ulster\r\ndelegates understood this perfectly, and, as their chief desire was to\r\nhelp the Government to get on with the war, they had no wish to curtail\r\nthe proceedings of the Convention, although they were never under the\r\ndelusion that it could lead to anything in Ireland.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the origin of this strange assembly of Irishmen it\r\nmight have been supposed that its ingenuity would be directed to finding\r\nsome modification of Mr. Asquith's Home Rule Act which Ulster could\r\naccept. That Act was the point of departure for its investigation, and\r\nthe quest was _ex hypothesi_ for some amendment that would not be an\r\nenlargement of the authority to be delegated to the subordinate\r\nParliament, or any further loosening of the tie with Great Britain. Any\r\nproposal of the latter sort would be in the opposite direction from that\r\nin which the Convention was intended to travel. Yet this is precisely\r\nwhat was done from the very outset. The Act of 1914 was brushed aside as\r\nbeneath contempt; and the Ulster delegates had to listen with amazement\r\nweek after week to proposals for giving to the whole of Ireland,\r\nincluding their own Province, a constitution practically as independent\r\nof Great Britain as that of the Dominions.\r\n\r\nBut what astonished the Ulstermen above everything was to find these\r\nextravagant demands of the Nationalists supported by those who were\r\nsupposed to be representatives of Southern Unionism, with Lord Midleton,\r\na prominent member of the Unionist Party in England, at their head. The\r\nonly material point on which Lord Midleton differed from the extremists\r\nled by the Bishop of Raphoe was that he wished to limit complete fiscal\r\nautonomy for Ireland by reserving the control of Customs duties to the\r\nImperial Parliament. Save in this single particular he joined forces\r\nwith the Nationalists, and shocked the Unionists of the North by giving\r\nhis support to a scheme of Home Rule going beyond anything ever\r\nsuggested at Westminster by any Radical from Gladstone to Asquith.\r\n\r\nThis question of the financial powers to be exercised by the\r\nhypothetical Irish Parliament occupied the Convention and its committees\r\nfor the greater part of its eight months of existence. In January 1918\r\nLord Midleton and Mr. Redmond came to an agreement on the subject which\r\nproved the undoing of them both, and produced the only really impressive\r\nscene in the Convention.\r\n\r\nFor some time Mr. Redmond had given the impression of being a tired man\r\nwho had lost his wonted driving-force. He took little or no part in the\r\nlobbying and canvassing that was constantly going on behind the scenes\r\nin the Convention; he appeared to be losing grip as a leader. But he\r\ncannot be blamed for his anxiety to come to terms with Lord Midleton;\r\nand when he found, no doubt greatly to his surprise, that a Unionist\r\nleader was ready to abandon Unionist principles and to accept Dominion\r\nHome Rule for Ireland, subject to a single reservation on the subject of\r\nCustoms, he naturally jumped at it, and assumed that his followers would\r\ndo the same.\r\n\r\nBut, while Mr. Redmond had been losing ground, the influence of the\r\nCatholic Bishop of Raphoe had been on the increase, and that able and\r\nastute prelate was entirely opposed to the compromise on which Mr.\r\nRedmond and Lord Midleton were agreed. On the evening of the 14th of\r\nJanuary it came to the knowledge of Mr. Redmond that when the question\r\ncame up for decision next day, he would find Mr. Devlin, his principal\r\nlieutenant, in league with the ecclesiastics against him. He was\r\npersonally too far committed to retrace his steps; to go forward meant\r\ndisaster, for it would produce a deep cleavage in the Nationalist ranks;\r\nand, as the state of affairs was generally known to members of the\r\nConvention, the sitting of the following day was anticipated with\r\nunusual interest.\r\n\r\nThere was an atmosphere of suppressed excitement when the Chairman took\r\nhis seat on the 15th. Mr. Redmond entered a few seconds later and took\r\nhis usual place without betraying the slightest sign of disturbed\r\nequanimity. The Bishop of Raphoe strode past him, casting to left and\r\nright swift, challenging glances. Mr. Devlin slipped quietly into his\r\nseat beside the leader he had thrown over, without a word or gesture of\r\ngreeting. All over the room small groups of members engaged in whispered\r\nconversation; an air of mysterious expectancy prevailed. The Ulster\r\nmembers had been threatened that it was to be for them a day of disaster\r\nand dismay--a little isolated group, about to be deserted by friends and\r\ncrushed by enemies. The Chairman, in an agitated voice, opened\r\nproceedings by inviting questions. There was no response. A minute or so\r\nof tense pause ensued. Then Mr. Redmond rose, and in a perfectly even\r\nvoice and his usual measured diction, stated that he was aware that his\r\nproposal was repudiated by many of his usual followers; that the bishops\r\nwere against him, and some leading Nationalists, including Mr. Devlin;\r\nthat, while he believed if he persisted he would have a majority, the\r\nresult would be to split his party, a thing he wished to avoid; and that\r\nhe had therefore decided not to proceed with his amendment, and under\r\nthese circumstances felt he could be of no further use to the Convention\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two the assembly could not grasp the full significance\r\nof what had happened. Then it broke upon them that this was the fall of\r\na notable leader, although they did not yet know that it was also the\r\nclose of a distinguished career. Mr. Redmond's demeanour throughout\r\nwhat must have been a painful ordeal was beyond all praise. There was\r\nnot a quiver in his voice, nor a hesitation for word or phrase. His\r\nself-possession and dignity and high-bred bearing won the respect and\r\nsympathy of the most strenuous of political opponents, even while they\r\nrecognised that the defeat of the Nationalist leader meant relief from\r\npressure on themselves. Mr. Redmond took no further part in the work of\r\nthe Convention; his health was failing, and the members were startled by\r\nthe news of his death on the 6th of March.\r\n\r\nNot a single vote was taken in the Convention until the 12th of March,\r\n1918, when it had been sitting for nearly seven months, and two days\r\nlater the question which it had been summoned to consider, namely, the\r\nrelation of Ulster to the rest of Ireland, was touched for the first\r\ntime. The first clause in the Bishop of Raphoe's scheme, establishing a\r\nHome Rule constitution for all Ireland, having been carried with Lord\r\nMidleton's help against the vote of the nineteen representatives of\r\nUlster, the latter proposed an amendment for the exclusion of the\r\nProvince, and were, of course, defeated by the combined forces of\r\nNationalism and Southern Unionism.\r\n\r\nThus, on the only issue that really mattered, there was no such\r\n\"substantial agreement\" as the Government had postulated as essential\r\nbefore legislation could be undertaken; and on the 5th of April the\r\nConvention came to an end without having achieved any useful result,\r\nexcept that it gave the Government a breathing space from the Irish\r\nquestion to get on with the war.\r\n\r\nIt served, however, to bring prominently forward two of the Ulster\r\nrepresentatives whose full worth had not till then been sufficiently\r\nappreciated. Mr. H.M. Pollock had, it is true, been a valued adviser of\r\nSir Edward Carson on questions touching the trade and commerce of\r\nBelfast. But in the Convention he made more than one speech which proved\r\nhim to be a financier with a comprehensive grasp of principle, and an\r\nextensive knowledge of the history and the intricate details of the\r\nfinancial relations between Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nLord Londonderry (the 7th Marquis), who during his father's lifetime\r\nhad represented an English constituency in the House of Commons and\r\nnaturally took no very prominent part in Ulster affairs, although he\r\nmade many excellent speeches on Home Rule both in Parliament and on\r\nEnglish platforms, and was Colonel of a regiment of U.V.F., gave proof\r\nat once, on succeeding to the peerage in 1915, that he was desirous of\r\ndoing everything in his power to fill his father's place in the Ulster\r\nMovement. He displayed the same readiness to subordinate personal\r\nconvenience, and other claims on his time and energy, to the cause so\r\nclosely associated historically with his family. But it was his work in\r\nthe Convention that first convinced Ulstermen of his capacity as well as\r\nhis zeal. Several of Lord Londonderry's speeches, and especially one in\r\nwhich he made an impromptu reply to Mr. Redmond, impressed the\r\nConvention with his debating power and his general ability; and it gave\r\nthe greatest satisfaction in Ulster when it was realised that the son of\r\nthe leader whose loss they mourned so deeply was as able as he was\r\nwilling to carry on the hereditary tradition of service to the loyalist\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIn another respect, too, the Convention had an indirect influence on the\r\nposition in Ulster. When it appeared likely, in January 1918, that a\r\ndeadlock would be reached in the Convention, the Prime Minister himself\r\nintervened. A letter to the Chairman was drafted and discussed in the\r\nCabinet; but the policy which appeared to commend itself to his\r\ncolleagues was one that Sir Edward Carson was unable to support, and he\r\naccordingly resigned office on the 21st, and was accompanied into\r\nretirement by Colonel Craig, the other Ulster member of the Ministry.\r\nSir John Lonsdale, who for many years had been the very efficient\r\nHonorary Secretary and \"Whip\" of the Ulster Parliamentary Party, and its\r\nleader while Carson was in office, had been raised to the peerage at the\r\nNew Year, with the title of Lord Armaghdale, so that the Ulster\r\nleadership was vacant for Carson to resume when he left the Government,\r\nand he was formally re-elected to the position on the 28th of January.\r\nIt was fortunate for Ulster that the old helmsman was again free to\r\ntake his place at the wheel, for there was still some rough weather\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nThe official Report of the Convention which was issued on the 10th of\r\nApril was one of the most extraordinary documents ever published in a\r\nGovernment Blue Book.[97] It consisted for the most part of a confused\r\nbundle of separate Notes and Reports by a number of different groups and\r\nindividuals, and numerous appendices comprising a mass of miscellaneous\r\nmemoranda bristling with cross-references. The Chairman was restricted\r\nto providing a bald narrative of the proceedings without any of the\r\nusual critical estimate of the general results attained; but he made up\r\nfor this by setting forth his personal opinions in a letter to the Prime\r\nMinister, which, without the sanction of the Convention, he prefixed to\r\nthe Report. As it was no easy matter to gain any clear idea from the\r\nReport as to what the Convention had done, its proceedings while in\r\nsession having been screened from publicity by drastic censorship of the\r\nPress, many people contented themselves with reading Sir Horace\r\nPlunkett's unauthorised letter to Mr. Lloyd George; and, as it was in\r\nsome important respects gravely misleading, it is not surprising that\r\nthe truth in regard to the Convention was never properly understood, and\r\nthe Ulster Unionist Council had solid justification for its resolution\r\ncensuring the Chairman's conduct as \"unprecedented and unconstitutional.\"\r\n\r\nIn this personal letter, as was to be expected of a partisan of the\r\nNationalists, Sir Horace Plunkett laid stress on the fact that Lord\r\nMidleton had \"accepted self-government for Ireland \"--by which was\r\nmeant, of course, not self-government such as Ireland always enjoyed\r\nthrough her representation, and indeed over-representation, in the\r\nImperial Parliament, but through separate institutions. But if it had\r\nnot been for this support of separate institutions by the Southern\r\nUnionists there would not have been even a colourable pretext for the\r\nassertion of Sir Horace Plunkett that \"a larger measure of agreement has\r\nbeen reached upon the principles and details of Irish self-government\r\nthan has ever yet been attained.\" The really surprising thing was how\r\nlittle agreement was displayed even among the Nationalists themselves,\r\nwho on several important issues were nearly equally divided.\r\n\r\nIt was soon seen how little the policy of Lord Midleton was approved by\r\nthose whom he was supposed to represent. Although it was exceedingly\r\ndifficult to obtain accurate information about what was going on in the\r\nConvention, enough became known in Dublin to cause serious misgiving to\r\nSouthern Unionists. The Council of the Irish Unionist Alliance, who had\r\nnominated Lord Midleton as a delegate, asked him to confer with them on\r\nthe subject; but he refused. On the 4th of March, 1918, a \"Call to\r\nUnionists,\" a manifesto signed by twenty-four influential Southern\r\nUnionists, appeared in the Press. A Southern Unionist Committee was\r\nformed which before the end of May was able to publish the names of 350\r\nwell-known men in all walks of life who were in accord with the \"Call,\"\r\nand to announce that the supporters of their protest against Lord\r\nMidleton's proceedings numbered upwards of fourteen thousand, of whom\r\nmore than two thousand were farmers in the South and West.\r\n\r\nThis Committee then took steps to purge the Irish Unionist Alliance by\r\nmaking it more truly representative of Southern Unionist opinion. A\r\nspecial meeting of the Council of the organisation on the 24th of\r\nJanuary, 1919, brought on a general engagement between Lord Midleton and\r\nhis opponents. The general trend of opinion was disclosed when, after\r\nthe defeat of a motion by Lord Midleton for excluding Ulster Unionists\r\nfrom full membership of the Alliance, Sir Edward Carson was elected one\r\nof its Presidents, and Lord Farnham was chosen Chairman of the Executive\r\nCommittee. The Executive Committee was then entirely reconstituted, by\r\nthe rejection of every one of Lord Midleton's supporters; and the new\r\nbody issued a statement explaining the grounds of dissatisfaction with\r\nLord Midleton's action in the Convention, and declaring that he had\r\n\"lost the confidence of the general body of Southern Unionists.\"\r\nThereupon Lord Midleton and a small aristocratic clique associated with\r\nhim seceded from the Alliance, and set up a little organisation of their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[96] _Report of the Proceedings of the Irish Convention_ (Cd. 9019), p.\r\n10.\r\n\r\n[97] Cd. 9019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nNATIONALISTS AND CONSCRIPTION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Irish Convention was toilfully bringing to a close its eight\r\nmonths' career of futility, the British Empire was in the grip of the\r\nmost terrible ordeal through which it has ever passed. On the 21st of\r\nMarch, 1918, the assembled Irishmen in Dublin were discussing whether or\r\nnot proportional representation should form part of the hypothetical\r\nconstitution of Ireland, and on the same day the Germans well-nigh\r\noverwhelmed the 5th Army at the opening of the great offensive campaign\r\nwhich threatened to break irretrievably the Allied line by the capture\r\nof Amiens. The world held its breath. Englishmen hardly dared to think\r\nof the fate that seemed impending over their country. Irishmen continued\r\ncomplacently debating the paltry details of the Bishop of Raphoe's\r\nclauses. Irishmen and Englishmen together were being killed or maimed by\r\nscores of thousands in a supreme effort to stay the advance of the Boche\r\nto Paris and the sea.\r\n\r\nIt happened that on the very day when the Report of the Convention was\r\nlaid on the table of the House of Commons, the Prime Minister made a\r\nstatement of profound gravity, beginning with words such as the British\r\nParliament can never before have been compelled to hear from the lips of\r\nthe head of the Government. For the moment, said Mr. Lloyd George, there\r\nwas a lull in the storm; but more attacks were to come, and--\r\n\r\n     The \"fate of the Empire, the fate of Europe, and the fate of\r\n     liberty throughout the world may depend on the success with which\r\n     the very last of these attacks is resisted and countered.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith struck the same note, urging the House--\r\n\r\n     \"With all the earnestness and with all the solemnity of which I am\r\n     capable, to realise that never before in the experience of any man\r\n     within these walls, or of his fathers and his forefathers, has this\r\n     country and all the great traditions and ideals which are embodied\r\n     in our history--never has this, the most splendid inheritance ever\r\n     bequeathed to a people, been in greater peril, or in more need of\r\n     united safeguarding than at this present time.\"\r\n\r\nNot Demosthenes himself, in his most impassioned appeal to the\r\nAthenians, more fitly matched moving words to urgent occasion than these\r\ntwo statesmen in the simple, restrained sentences, in which they warned\r\nthe Commons of the peril hanging over England.\r\n\r\nBut was eloquent persuasion really required at such a moment to still\r\nthe voice of faction in the British House of Commons? Let those who\r\nwould assume the negative study the official Parliamentary Report of the\r\ndebate on the 9th of April, 1918. They will find a record which no loyal\r\nIrishman will ever be able to read without a tingling sense of shame.\r\nThe whole body of members, with one exception, listened to the Prime\r\nMinister's grave words in silence touched with awe, feeling that perhaps\r\nthey were sitting there on the eve of the greatest tragedy in their\r\ncountry's history. The single exception was the Nationalist Party. From\r\nthose same benches whence arose nineteen years back the never-forgotten\r\ncheers that greeted the tale of British disaster in South Africa, now\r\ncame a shower of snarling interruptions that broke persistently into the\r\nPrime Minister's speech, and with angry menace impeded his unfolding of\r\nthe Government's proposals for meeting the supreme ordeal of the war.\r\n\r\nWhat was the reason? It was because Ireland, the greater part of which\r\nhad till now successfully shirked its share of privation and sacrifice,\r\nwas at last to be asked to take up its corner of the burden. The need\r\nfor men to replace casualties at the front was pressing, urgent,\r\nimperative. Many indeed blamed the Government for having delayed too\r\nlong in filling the depleted ranks of our splendid armies in France; the\r\nmoment had come when another day's delay would have been criminal. As\r\nMr. Lloyd George pointed out, the battle that was being waged in front\r\nof Amiens \"proves that the enemy has definitely decided to seek a\r\nmilitary decision this year, whatever the consequences to himself.\" The\r\nGermans had just called up a fresh class of recruits calculated to place\r\nmore than half a million of efficient young men in the line. The\r\ncollapse of Russia had released the vast German armies of the East for\r\nuse against England and France. It was under such circumstances that the\r\nPrime Minister proposed\r\n\r\n     \"to submit to Parliament to-day certain recommendations in order to\r\n     assist this country and the Allies to weather the storm. They will\r\n     involve,\" continued Mr. Lloyd George, \"extreme sacrifices on the\r\n     part of large classes of the population, and nothing would justify\r\n     them but the most extreme necessity, and the fact that we are\r\n     fighting for all that is essential and most sacred in the national\r\n     life.\"\r\n\r\nThe age limit for compulsory military service was to be raised from\r\nforty-two to fifty, and Ireland was to be included under the new\r\nMilitary Service Bill now introduced. England, Scotland, and Wales had\r\ncheerfully submitted to conscription when first enacted by Mr. Asquith\r\nin 1916, and to all the additional combings of industry and extension of\r\nobligation that had been required in the past two years. Agriculture and\r\nother essential industries were being starved for want of labour, and\r\nmen had actually been brought back from the sorely pressed armies to\r\nproduce supplies imperatively needed at home.\r\n\r\nBut from all this Ireland had hitherto been exempt. To escape the call\r\nof the country a man had only to prove that he was \"ordinarily resident\r\nin Ireland\"; for conscription did not cross the Irish Sea. From most of\r\nthe privations cheerfully borne in Great Britain the Irishman had been\r\nequally free. Food rationing did not trouble him, and, lest he should go\r\nshort of accustomed plenty, it was even forbidden to carry a parcel of\r\nbutter across the Channel from Ireland. Horse-racing went on as usual.\r\nEmigration had been suspended during the war, so that Ireland was\r\nunusually full of young men who, owing to the unwonted prosperity of the\r\ncountry resulting from war prices for its produce, were \"having the\r\ntime of their lives.\" Mr. Bonar Law, in the debates on the Military\r\nService Bill, gave reasons for the calculation that there were not far\r\nshort of 400,000 young men of military age, and of \"Al\" physique, in\r\nIreland available for the Army.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Mr. Lloyd George said it would be impossible to leave\r\nthis reservoir of man-power untouched when men of fifty, whose sons were\r\nalready with the colours, were to be called up in Great Britain! But the\r\nbare suggestion of doing such a thing raised a hurricane of angry\r\nvituperation and menace from the Nationalists in the House of Commons.\r\nWhen Mr. Lloyd George, in conciliatory accents, observed that he had no\r\nwish to raise unnecessary controversy, as Heaven knew they had trouble\r\nenough already, \"You will get more of it,\" shouted Mr. Flavin. \"You will\r\nhave another battle front in Ireland,\" interjected Mr. Byrne. Mr.\r\nFlavin, getting more and more excited, called out, with reference to the\r\nmachinery for enrolment explained by the Prime Minister--\"It will never\r\nbegin. Ireland will not have it at any price\"; and again, a moment\r\nlater, \"You come across and try to take them.\" Mr. Devlin was fully as\r\nfierce as these less prominent members of his party, and after many\r\nwrathful interruptions he turned aside the debate into a discussion\r\nabout a trumpery report of one of the sub-committees of the Irish\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nIt was truly a sad and shameful scene to be witnessed in the House of\r\nCommons at such a moment. It would have been so even if the contention\r\nof the Nationalists had been reasonably tenable. But it was not. They\r\nmaintained that only an Irish Parliament had the right to enforce\r\nconscription in Ireland. But at the beginning of the war they had\r\naccepted the proviso that it should run its course before Home Rule came\r\ninto operation. And even if it had been in operation, and a Parliament\r\nhad been sitting in Dublin under Mr. Asquith's Act, which the\r\nNationalists had accepted as a settlement of their demands, that\r\nParliament would have had nothing to do with the raising of military\r\nforces by conscription or otherwise, this being a duty reserved, as in\r\nevery federal or quasi-federal constitution, for the central\r\nlegislative authority alone.\r\n\r\nBut it was useless to point this out to the infuriated Nationalist\r\nmembers. Mr. William O'Brien denounced the idea of compelling Irishmen\r\nto bear the same burden as their British fellow-subjects as \"a\r\ndeclaration of war against Ireland\"; and he and Mr. Healy joined Mr.\r\nDillon and his followers in opposing with all their parliamentary skill,\r\nand all their voting power, the extension to Ireland of compulsory\r\nservice. Mr. Healy, whose vindictive memory had not forgotten the\r\nCurragh Incident before the war, could not forbear from having an\r\nungenerous fling at General Gough, who had just been driven back by the\r\noverwhelming numerical superiority of the German attack, and who, at the\r\nmoment when Mr. Healy was taunting him in the House of Commons, was\r\nre-forming his gallant 5th Army to resist the enemy's further advance.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with this Mr. Healy's stale gibe at \"Carson's Army,\"\r\nhowever inappropriate to the occasion, was a venial offence. Carson\r\nhimself replied in a gentle and conciliatory tone to Mr. Healy's coarse\r\ndiatribe.\r\n\r\n     \"My honourable friend,\" he said, \"talked of Carson's Army. You may,\r\n     if you like, call it with contempt Carson's Army. But it has just\r\n     gone into action for the fourth time, and many of them have paid\r\n     the supreme sacrifice. They have covered themselves with glory,\r\n     and, what is more, they have covered Ireland with glory, and they\r\n     have left behind sad homes throughout the small hamlets of Ulster,\r\n     as I well know, losing three or four sons in many a home.\"\r\n\r\nOn behalf of Ulster Carson gave unhesitating support to the Government.\r\nHe and his colleagues from Ulster had always voted against the exemption\r\nof Ireland from the Military Service Acts. It was true, no doubt, as the\r\nNationalists jeeringly maintained, that conscription was no more desired\r\nin Ulster than in any other part of the United Kingdom. Of course it was\r\nnot; it was liked nowhere. But Carson declared that \"equality of\r\nsacrifice\" was the principle to be acted upon, and Ulster accepted it.\r\nHe \"would go about hanging his head in shame,\" if his own part of the\r\nUnited Kingdom were absolved from sacrifice which the national necessity\r\nimposed on the inhabitants of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe Bill was carried through by the 16th of April in the teeth of\r\nNationalist opposition maintained through all its stages. Mr. Bonar Law\r\nannounced emphatically that the Government intended to enforce the\r\ncompulsory powers in Ireland; but he also said that yet another attempt\r\nwas to be made to settle the constitutional question by bringing in \"at\r\nan early date\" a measure of Home Rule which the Government hoped might\r\nbe carried at once and \"without violent controversy.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the experience of the past this seemed an amazingly sanguine\r\nestimate of the prospects of any proposals that ingenuity could devise.\r\nBut what the nature of the measure was to have been was never made\r\nknown; for the Bill was still in the hands of a drafting committee when\r\na dangerous German intrigue in Ireland was discovered; and the\r\nLord-Lieutenant made a proclamation on the 18th of May announcing that\r\nthe Government had information \"that certain of the King's subjects in\r\nIreland had entered into a treasonable communication with the German\r\nenemy, and that strict measures must be taken to put down this German\r\nplot.\"[98] On the same day one hundred and fifty Sinn Feiners were\r\narrested, including Mr. De Valera and Mr. Arthur Griffith, and on the\r\n25th a statement was published indicating the connection between this\r\nconspiracy and Casement's designs in 1916. The Government had definitely\r\nascertained some weeks earlier, and must have known at the very time\r\nwhen they were promising a new Home Rule Bill, that a plan for landing\r\narms in Ireland was ripe for execution.[99] Indeed, on the 12th of April\r\na German agent who had landed in Ireland was arrested, with papers in\r\nhis possession showing that De Valera had worked out a detailed\r\norganisation of the rebel army, and expected to be in a position to\r\nmuster half a million of trained men.[100]\r\n\r\nSuch was the fruit of the Government's infatuation which, under the\r\ndelusion of \"creating an atmosphere of good-will\" for the Convention,\r\nhad released a few months previously a number of dangerous men who had\r\nbeen proved to be in league with the Germans, and who now took advantage\r\nof this clemency to conspire afresh with the foreign enemy. It was not\r\nsurprising that Mr. Bonar Law said it was impossible for the Government,\r\nunder these circumstances, to proceed with their proposals for a new\r\nHome Rule Bill.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, no sooner was the Military Service Act on the\r\nStatute-book than the Government began to recede from Mr. Bonar Law's\r\ndeclaration that they would at all costs enforce it in Ireland. They\r\nintimated that if voluntary recruiting improved it might be possible to\r\ndispense with compulsion. But although Mr. Shortt--who succeeded Mr.\r\nDuke as Chief Secretary in May, at the same time as Lord Wimborne was\r\nreplaced in the Lord-Lieutenancy by Field-Marshal Lord French--complained\r\non the 29th of July that the Nationalists had given no help to the\r\nGovernment in obtaining voluntary recruits in Ireland, and, \"instead of\r\ntaking Sinn Fein by the throat, had tried to go one better,\"[101] the\r\ncompulsory powers of the Military Service Act remained a dead letter.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the Nationalists had followed up their fierce\r\nopposition to the Bill by raising a still more fierce agitation in\r\nIreland against conscription. In this they joined hands with Sinn Fein,\r\nand the whole weight of the Catholic Church was thrown into the same\r\nscale. From the altars of that Church the thunderbolts of ecclesiastical\r\nanathema were loosed against the Government, and--what was more\r\neffective--against any who should obey the call to arms. The Government\r\ngave way before the violence of the storm, and the lesson to be learnt\r\nfrom their defeat was not thrown away on the rebel party in Ireland.\r\nThere was, naturally, widespread indignation in England at the spectacle\r\nof the youth of Ireland taking its ease at home and earning\r\nextravagantly high war-time wages while middle-aged bread-winners in\r\nEngland were compulsorily called to the colours; but the marvellously\r\neasy-going disposition of Englishmen submitted to the injustice with no\r\nmore than a legitimate grumble.\r\n\r\nIn June 1918, while this agitation against conscription was at its\r\nheight, the hostility of the Nationalists took a new turn. A manifesto,\r\nintended as a justification of their resistance to conscription, was\r\nissued in the form of a letter to Mr. Wilson, President of the United\r\nStates, signed by Mr. Dillon, Mr. Devlin, Mr. William O'Brien, Mr.\r\nHealy, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, and some others, including leaders of\r\nSinn Fein. It was a remarkable document, the authorship of which was\r\npopularly attributed to Mr. T.M. Healy. If it ever came under the eye of\r\nMr. Wilson, a man of literary taste and judgment, it must have afforded\r\nhim a momentary diversion from the cares of his exalted office. A longer\r\nexperience than his of diplomatic correspondence would fail to produce\r\nfrom the pigeon-holes of all the Chanceries a rival to this\r\nextraordinary composition, the ill-arranged paragraphs of which formed\r\nan inextricable jumble of irrelevant material, in which bad logic, bad\r\nhistory, and barren invective were confusedly intermingled in a torrent\r\nof turgid rhetoric. The extent of its range may be judged from the fact\r\nthat Shakespeare's allusions to Joan of Arc were not deemed too remote\r\nfrom the subject of conscription in Ireland during the Great War to find\r\na place in this amazing despatch. For the amusement of anyone who may\r\ncare to examine so rare a curiosity of English prose, it will be found\r\nin full in the Appendix to this volume, where it may be compared by way\r\nof contrast with the restrained rejoinder sent also to President Wilson\r\nby Sir Edward Carson, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, the Mayor of Derry, and\r\nseveral loyalist representatives of Labour in Ulster.\r\n\r\nIn the Nationalist letter to President Wilson reference was made more\r\nthan once to the sympathy that prevailed in Ireland in the eighteenth\r\ncentury with the American colonists in the War of Independence. The use\r\nmade of it was a good example of the way in which a half-truth may, for\r\nargumentative purposes, be more misleading than a complete falsehood.\r\n\"To-day, as in the days of George Washington\"--so Mr. Wilson was\r\ninformed--\"nearly half the American forces have been furnished from the\r\ndescendants of our banished race.\" No mention was made of the fact that\r\nthe members of the \"banished race\" in Washington's army were\r\nPresbyterian emigrants from Ulster, who formed almost the entire\r\npopulation of great districts in the American Colonies at that\r\ntime.[102] The late Mr. Whitelaw Reid told an Edinburgh audience in 1911\r\nthat more than half the Presbyterian population of Ulster emigrated to\r\nAmerica between 1730 and 1770, and that at the date of the Revolution\r\nthey made more than one-sixth of the population of the Colonies. The\r\nDeclaration of Independence itself, he added--\r\n\r\n     \"Is sacredly preserved in the handwriting of an Ulsterman, who was\r\n     Secretary of Congress. It was publicly read by an Ulsterman, and\r\n     first printed by another. Washington's first Cabinet had four\r\n     members, of whom one was an Ulsterman.\"[103]\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, true that not all Ulster Presbyterians of that period\r\nwere the firm and loyal friends of Great Britain that their descendants\r\nbecame after a century's experience of the legislative Union. But it is\r\nthe latter who best in Ireland can trace kinship with the founders of\r\nthe United States, and who are entitled--if any Irishmen are--to base on\r\nthat kinship a claim to the sympathy and support of the American people.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[98] _Annual Register_, 1918, p, 87.\r\n\r\n[99] Ibid., p. 88\r\n\r\n[100] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[101] _Annual Register_, 1918, p. 90.\r\n\r\n[102] See Lecky's _History of England in the Eighteenth Century_, vol.\r\niv, p. 430.\r\n\r\n[103] See Lecture to the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution by Whitelaw\r\nReid, reported in _The Scotsman_, November 2nd, 1911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE ULSTER PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nON the 25th of November, 1918, the Parliament elected in December 1910\r\nwas at last dissolved, a few days after the Armistice with Germany. The\r\nnew House of Commons was very different from the old. Seventy-two Sinn\r\nFein members were returned from Ireland, sweeping away all but half a\r\ndozen of the old Nationalist party; but, in accordance with their fixed\r\npolicy, the Sinn Fein members never presented themselves at Westminster\r\nto take the oath and their seats. That quarter of the House of Commons\r\nwhich for thirty years had been packed with the most fierce and\r\ndisciplined of the political parties was therefore now given over to\r\nmild supporters of the Coalition Government, the only remnant of\r\nso-called \"constitutional Nationalism\" being Mr. T.P. O'Connor, Mr.\r\nDevlin, Captain Redmond, and two or three less prominent companions, who\r\nsurvived like monuments of a bygone age.\r\n\r\nUlster Unionists, on the other hand, were greatly strengthened by the\r\nrecent Redistribution Act. Sir Edward Carson was elected member for the\r\ngreat working-class constituency of the Duncairn Division of Belfast,\r\ninstead of for Dublin University, which he had so long represented, and\r\ntwenty-two ardent supporters accompanied him from Ulster to Westminster.\r\nIn the reconstruction of the Government which followed the election,\r\nCarson was pressed to return to office, but declined. Colonel James\r\nCraig, whose war services in connection with the Ulster Division were\r\nrewarded by a baronetcy, became Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry\r\nof Pensions, and the Marquis of Londonderry accepted office as\r\nParliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Air Ministry.\r\n\r\nAlthough the termination of hostilities by the Armistice was not in the\r\nlegal sense the \"end of the war,\" it brought it within sight. No one in\r\nJanuary 1919 dreamt that the process of making peace and ratifying the\r\nnecessary treaties would drag on for a seemingly interminable length of\r\ntime, and it was realised, with grave misgiving in Ulster, that the Home\r\nRule Act of 1914 would necessarily come into force as soon as peace was\r\nfinally declared, while as yet nothing had been done to redeem the\r\npromise of an Amending Bill given by Mr. Asquith, and reiterated by Mr.\r\nLloyd George. The compact between the latter and the Unionist Party, on\r\nwhich the Coalition had swept the country, had made it clear that fresh\r\nIrish legislation was to be expected, and the general lines on which it\r\nwould be based were laid down; but there was also an intimation that a\r\nsettlement must wait till the condition of Ireland should warrant\r\nit.[104]\r\n\r\nThe state of Ireland was certainly not such as to make it appear\r\nprobable that any sane Government would take the risk of handing over\r\ncontrol of the country immediately to the Sinn Feiners, whom the recent\r\nelections had proved to be in an overwhelming majority in the three\r\nsouthern provinces. By the law, not of England alone, but of every\r\ncivilised State, that party was tainted through and through with high\r\ntreason. It had attempted to \"succour the King's enemies\" in every way\r\nin its power. The Government had in its possession evidence of two\r\nconspiracies, in which, during the late frightful war, these Irishmen\r\nhad been in league with the Germans to bring defeat and disaster upon\r\nEngland and her Allies, and the second of these plots was only made\r\npossible by the misconceived clemency of the Government in releasing\r\nfrom custody the ring-leaders in the first.\r\n\r\nAnd these Sinn Fein rebels left the Government no excuse for any\r\nillusion as to their being either chastened or contrite in spirit.\r\nContemptuously ignoring their election as members of the Imperial\r\nParliament, where they never put in an appearance because it would\r\nrequire them to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, they openly\r\nheld a Congress in Dublin in January 1919 where a Declaration of\r\nIndependence was read, and a demand made for the evacuation of Ireland\r\nby the forces of the Crown. A \"Ministry\" was also appointed, which\r\npurported to make itself responsible for administration in Ireland.\r\nOutrages of a daring character became more and more frequent, and gave\r\nevidence of being the work of efficient organisation.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson's coinage of the unfortunate and ambiguous expression\r\n\"self-determination\" made it a catch-penny cry in relation to Ireland;\r\nbut, in reply to Mr. Devlin's demand for a recognition of that\r\n\"principle,\" Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that it had been tried in the\r\nConvention, with the result that both Nationalists and Unionists had\r\nbeen divided among themselves, and he said he despaired of any\r\nsettlement in Ireland until Irishmen could agree. Nevertheless, in\r\nOctober 1919 he appointed a Cabinet Committee, with Mr. Walter Long as\r\nChairman, to make recommendations for dealing with the question of Irish\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut murders of soldiers and police had now become so scandalously\r\nfrequent that in November a Proclamation was issued suppressing Sinn\r\nFein and kindred organisations. It did nothing to improve the state of\r\nthe country, which grew worse than ever in the last few weeks of the\r\nyear. On the 19th of December a carefully planned attempt on the life of\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant, Lord French, proved how complete was the impunity\r\nrelied upon by the organised assassins who, calling themselves an Irish\r\nRepublican Army, terrorised the country.\r\n\r\nIt was in such conditions that, just before the close of the\r\nparliamentary session, the Prime Minister disclosed the intentions of\r\nthe Government. He laid down three \"basic facts,\" which he said governed\r\nthe situation: (1) Three-fourths of the Irish people were bitterly\r\nhostile, and were at heart rebels against the Crown and Government. (2)\r\nUlster was a complete contrast, which would make it an outrage to place\r\nher people under the rest of Ireland.[105] (3) No separation from the\r\nEmpire could be tolerated, and any attempt to force it would be fought\r\nas the United States had fought against secession. On these\r\nconsiderations he based the proposals which were to be embodied in\r\nlegislation in the next session. Sir Edward Carson, who in the light of\r\npast experience was too wary to take all Mr. Lloyd George's declarations\r\nat their face value, said at once that he could give no support to the\r\npolicy outlined by the Prime Minister until he was convinced that the\r\nlatter intended to go through with it to the end.\r\n\r\nThe Bill to give effect to these proposals (which became the Government\r\nof Ireland Act, 1920) was formally introduced on the 25th of February,\r\n1920, and Carson then went over to Belfast to consult with the Unionist\r\nCouncil as to the action to be taken by the Ulster members.\r\n\r\nThe measure was a long and complicated one of seventy clauses and six\r\nschedules. Its effect, stated briefly, was to set up two Parliaments in\r\nIreland, one for the six Protestant counties of Ulster and the other for\r\nthe rest of Ireland. In principle it was the \"clean cut\" which had been\r\nseveral times proposed, except that, instead of retaining Ulster in\r\nlegislative union with Great Britain, she was to be endowed with local\r\ninstitutions of her own in every respect similar to, and commensurate\r\nwith, those given to the Parliament in Dublin. In addition, a Council of\r\nIreland was created, composed of an equal number of members from each of\r\nthe two legislatures. This Council was given powers in regard to private\r\nbill legislation, and matters of minor importance affecting both parts\r\nof the island which the two Parliaments might mutually agree to commit\r\nto its administration. Power was given to the two Parliaments to\r\nestablish by identical Acts at any time a Parliament for all Ireland to\r\nsupersede the Council, and to form a single autonomous constitution for\r\nthe whole of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Ireland occupied a prominent place in the debates on the\r\nBill. It was held up as a symbol of the \"unity of Ireland,\" and the\r\nauthors of the measure were able to point to it as supplying machinery\r\nby which \"partition\" could be terminated as soon as Irishmen agreed\r\namong themselves in wishing to have a single national Government. It was\r\nnot a feature of the Bill that found favour in Ulster; but, as it could\r\ndo no harm and provided an argument against those who denounced\r\n\"partition,\" the Ulster members did not think it worth while to oppose\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut when Carson met the Ulster Unionist Council on the 6th of March the\r\nmost difficult point he had to deal with was the same that had given so\r\nmuch trouble in the negotiations of 1916. The Bill defined the area\r\nsubject to the \"Parliament of Northern Ireland\" as the six counties\r\nwhich the Ulster Council had agreed four years earlier to accept as the\r\narea to be excluded from the Home Rule Act. The question now to be\r\ndecided was whether this same area should still be accepted, or an\r\namendment moved for including in Northern Ireland the other three\r\ncounties of the Province of Ulster. The same harrowing experience which\r\nthe Council had undergone in 1916 was repeated in an aggravated\r\nform.[106] To separate themselves from fellow loyalists in Monaghan,\r\nCavan, and Donegal was hateful to every delegate from the other six\r\ncounties, and it was heartrending to be compelled to resist another\r\nmoving appeal by so valued a friend as Lord Farnham. But the inexorable\r\nindex of statistics demonstrated that, although Unionists were in a\r\nmajority when geographical Ulster was considered as a unit, yet the\r\ndistribution of population made it certain that a separate Parliament\r\nfor the whole Province would have a precarious existence, while its\r\nadministration of purely Nationalist districts would mean unending\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, decided that no proposal for extending the area\r\nshould be made by the Ulster members. Carson made it clear in the\r\ndebates on the Bill that Ulster had not moved from her old position of\r\ndesiring nothing except the Union; that he was still convinced there was\r\n\"no alternative to the Union unless separation\"; but that, while he\r\nwould take no responsibility for a Bill which Ulster did not want, he\r\nand his colleagues would not actively oppose its progress to the\r\nStatute-book.\r\n\r\nIt did not, however, receive the Royal Assent until two days before\r\nChristmas, and during all these months the condition of Ireland was one\r\nof increasing anarchy. The Act provided that, if the people of Southern\r\nIreland refused to work the new Constitution, the administration should\r\nbe carried on by a system similar to Crown Colony government. Carson\r\ngave an assurance that in Ulster they would do their best to make the\r\nAct a success, and immediate steps were taken in Belfast to make good\r\nthis undertaking.\r\n\r\nTo the people of Ulster the Act of 1920, though it involved the\r\nsacrifice of much that they had ardently hoped to preserve, came as a\r\nrelief to their worst fears. It was represented as a final settlement,\r\nand finality was what they chiefly desired, if they could get it without\r\nbeing forced to submit to a Dublin Parliament. The disloyal conduct of\r\nNationalist Ireland during the war, and the treason and terrorism\r\norganised by Sinn Fein after the war, had widened the already broad gulf\r\nbetween North and South. The determination never to submit to an\r\nall-Ireland Parliament was more firmly fixed than ever. The Act of 1920,\r\nwhich repealed Mr. Asquith's Act of 1914, gave Ulster what she had\r\nprepared to fight for, if necessary, before the war. It was the\r\nfulfilment of the Craigavon resolution--to take over the government \"of\r\nthose districts which they could control.\"[107] The Parliament of\r\nNorthern Ireland established by the Act was in fact the legalisation of\r\nthe Ulster Provisional Government of 1913. It placed Ulster in a\r\nposition of equality with the South, both politically and economically.\r\nThe two Legislatures in Ireland possessed the same powers, and were\r\nsubject to an equal reservation of authority to the Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut with the passing of the Act the long and consummate leadership of\r\nSir Edward Carson came to an end. If he had not succeeded in bringing\r\nthe Ulster people into a Promised Land, he had at least conducted an\r\norderly retreat to a position of safety. The almost miraculous skill\r\nwith which he had directed all the operations of a protracted and\r\nharassing campaign, avoiding traps and pitfalls at every step,\r\nforeseeing and providing against countless crises, frustrating with\r\nunfailing adroitness the manoeuvres both of implacable enemies and\r\ntreacherous \"friends,\" was fully appreciated by his grateful followers,\r\nwho had for years past regarded him with an intensity of personal\r\ndevotion seldom given even to the greatest of political leaders. But he\r\nfelt that the task of opening a new chapter in the history of Ulster,\r\nand of inaugurating the new institutions now established, was work for\r\nyounger hands. Hard as he was pressed to accept the position of first\r\nPrime Minister of Ulster, he firmly persisted in his refusal; and on his\r\nrecommendation the man who had been his able and faithful lieutenant\r\nthroughout the long Ulster Movement was unanimously chosen to succeed\r\nhim in the leadership.\r\n\r\nSir James Craig did not hesitate to respond to the call, although to do\r\nso he had to resign an important post in the British Government, that of\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, with excellent prospects of\r\nfurther promotion. As soon as the elections in \"Northern Ireland,\"\r\nconducted under the system of Proportional Representation, as provided\r\nby the Act of 1920, were complete, Sir James, whose followers numbered\r\nforty as against a Nationalist and Sinn Fein minority of twelve, was\r\nsent for by the Viceroy and commissioned to form a Ministry. He\r\nimmediately set himself to his new and exceedingly difficult duties with\r\ncharacteristic thoroughness. The whole apparatus of government\r\nadministration had to be built up from the foundation. Departments, for\r\nwhich there was no existing office accommodation or personnel, had to\r\nbe called into existence and efficiently organised, and all this\r\npreliminary work had to be undertaken at a time when the territory\r\nsubject to the new Government was beset by open and concealed enemies\r\nworking havoc with bombs and revolvers, with which the Government had\r\nnot yet legal power to cope.\r\n\r\nBut Sir James Craig pressed on with the work, undismayed by the\r\ndifficulties, and resolved that the Parliament in Belfast should be\r\nopened at the earliest possible date. The Marquis of Londonderry gave a\r\nfresh proof of his Ulster patriotism by resigning his office in the\r\nImperial Government and accepting the portfolio of Education in Sir\r\nJames Craig's Cabinet, and with it the leadership of the Ulster Senate;\r\nin which the Duke of Abercorn also, to the great satisfaction of the\r\nUlster people, consented to take a seat. Mr. Dawson Bates, the\r\nindefatigable Secretary of the Ulster Unionist Council during the whole\r\nof the Ulster Movement, was appointed Minister for Home Affairs, and Mr.\r\nE.M. Archdale became Minister for Agriculture. The first act of the\r\nHouse of Commons of Northern Ireland was to choose Major Hugh O'Neill as\r\ntheir Speaker, while the important position of Chairman of Committees\r\nwas entrusted to Mr. Thomas Moles, one of the ablest recruits of the\r\nUlster Parliamentary Party, whom the General Election of 1918 had sent\r\nto Westminster as one of the members for Belfast, and who had given\r\nample evidence of his capacity both in the Imperial Parliament and on\r\nthe Secretarial Staff of the Irish Convention of 1917.\r\n\r\nMeantime, in the South the Act of 1920 was treated with absolute\r\ncontempt; no step was taken to hold elections or to form an\r\nAdministration, although it must be remembered that the flouted Act\r\nconferred a larger measure of Home Rule than had ever been offered by\r\nprevious Bills. Thus by one of those curious ironies that have\r\ncontinually marked the history of Ireland, the only part of the island\r\nwhere Home Rule operated was the part that had never desired it, while\r\nthe provinces that had demanded Home Rule for generations refused to use\r\nit when it was granted them.\r\n\r\nIn Ulster the new order of things was accepted with acquiescence rather\r\nthan with enthusiasm. But the warmer emotion was immediately called\r\nforth when it became known that His Majesty the King had decided to open\r\nthe Ulster Parliament in person on the 22nd of June, 1921, especially as\r\nit was fully realised that, owing to the anarchical condition of the\r\ncountry, the King's presence in Belfast would be a characteristic\r\ndisregard of personal danger in the discharge of public duty. And when,\r\non the eve of the royal visit, it was intimated that the Queen had been\r\ngraciously pleased to accede to Sir James Craig's request that she\r\nshould accompany the King to Belfast, the enthusiasm of the loyal people\r\nof the North rose to fever heat.\r\n\r\nAt any time, and under any circumstances, the reigning Sovereign and\r\nhis Consort would have been received by a population so noted for its\r\nsentiment of loyalty to the Throne as that of Ulster with demonstrations\r\nof devotion exceeding the ordinary. But the present occasion was felt to\r\nhave a very special significance. The opening of Parliament by the King\r\nin State is one of the most ancient and splendid of ceremonial pageants\r\nillustrating the history of British institutions. It was felt in Ulster\r\nthat the association of this time-honoured ceremonial with the baptism,\r\nso to speak, of the latest offspring of the Mother of Parliaments\r\nstamped the Royal Seal upon the achievement of Ulster, and gave it a\r\ndignity, prestige, and promise of permanence which might otherwise have\r\nbeen lacking. No city in the United Kingdom had witnessed so many\r\nextraordinary displays of popular enthusiasm in the last ten years as\r\nBelfast, some of which had left on the minds of observers a firm belief\r\nthat such intensity of emotion in a great concourse of people could not\r\nbe exceeded. The scene in the streets when the King and Queen drove from\r\nthe quay, on the arrival of the royal yacht, to the City Hall, was held\r\nby general consent to equal, since it could not surpass, any of those\r\ngreat demonstrations of the past in popular fervour. At any rate,\r\npersons of long experience in attendance on the Royal Family gave it as\r\ntheir opinion in the evening that they had never before seen so\r\nimpressive a display of public devotion to the person of the Sovereign.\r\n\r\nTwo buildings in Belfast inseparably associated with Ulster's stand for\r\nunion, the City Hall and the Ulster Hall, were the scenes of the chief\r\nevents of the King's visit. The former, described by one of the English\r\ncorrespondents as \"easily the most magnificent municipal building in the\r\nthree Kingdoms,\"[108] was placed at the disposal of the Ulster\r\nGovernment by the Corporation for temporary use as a Parliament House.\r\nThe Council Chamber, a fine hall of dignified proportions with a dais\r\nand canopied chair at the upper end, made an appropriate frame for the\r\nceremony of opening Parliament, and the arrangements both of the\r\nChamber itself and of the approaches and entrances to it made it a\r\nsimple matter to model the procedure as closely as possible on that\r\nfollowed at Westminster.\r\n\r\nAmong the many distinguished people who assembled in the Ulster Capital\r\nfor the occasion, there was one notable absentee. Lord Carson of\r\nDuncairn--for this was the title that Sir Edward Carson had assumed on\r\nbeing appointed a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary a few weeks previously--was\r\ndetained in London by judicial duty in the House of Lords; and possibly\r\nreasons of delicacy not difficult to understand restrained him from\r\nmaking arrangements for absence. But the marked ovation given to Lady\r\nCarson wherever she was recognised in the streets of Belfast showed that\r\nthe great leader was not absent from the popular mind at this moment of\r\nvindication of his statesmanship.\r\n\r\nSuch an event as that which brought His Majesty to Belfast was naturally\r\nan occasion for bestowing marks of distinction for public service. Sir\r\nJames Craig wisely made it also an occasion for letting bygones be\r\nbygones by recommending Lord Pirrie for a step in the Peerage. Among\r\nthose who received honours were several whose names have appeared in the\r\npreceding chapters of this book. Mr. William Robert Young, for thirty\r\nyears one of the most indefatigable workers for the Unionist cause in\r\nUlster, and Colonel Wallace, one of the most influential of Carson's\r\nlocal lieutenants, were made Privy Councillors, as was also Colonel\r\nPercival-Maxwell, who raised and commanded a battalion of the Ulster\r\nDivision in the war. Colonel F.H. Crawford and Colonel Spender were\r\nawarded the C.B.E. for services to the nation during the war; but\r\nUlstermen did not forget services of another sort to the Ulster cause\r\nbefore the Germans came on the scene.[109] A knighthood was given to Mr.\r\nDawson Bates, who had exchanged the Secretaryship of the Ulster Unionist\r\nCouncil for the portfolio of a Cabinet Minister.\r\n\r\nThese honours were bestowed by the King in person at an investiture held\r\nin the Ulster Hall in the afternoon. There must have been many present\r\nwhose minds went back to some of the most stirring events of Ulster's\r\ndomestic history which had been transacted in the same building within\r\nrecent years. Did Sir Hamar Greenwood, the Chief Secretary, as he stood\r\nin attendance on the Sovereign in the resplendent uniform of a Privy\r\nCouncillor, look in curiosity round the walls which he and Mr. Churchill\r\nhad been prohibited from entering on a memorable occasion when they had\r\nto content themselves with an imported tent in a football field instead?\r\nDid Colonel Wallace's thoughts wander back to the scene of wild\r\nenthusiasm in that hall on the evening before the Covenant, when he\r\npresented the ancient Boyne flag to the Ulster leader? Did those who\r\nspontaneously started the National Anthem in the presence of the King\r\nwithout warrant from the prearranged programme, and made the Queen smile\r\nat the emphasis with which they \"confounded politics\" and \"frustrated\r\nknavish tricks,\" remember the fervour with which on many a past occasion\r\nthe same strains testified to Ulster's loyalty in the midst of\r\nperplexity and apprehension? If these memories crowded in, they must\r\nhave added to the sense of relief arising from the conviction that the\r\nceremony they were now witnessing was the realisation of the policy\r\npropounded by Carson, when he declared that Ulster must always be ruled\r\neither by the Imperial Parliament or by a Government of her own.\r\n\r\nBut the moment of all others on that memorable day that must have been\r\nsuggestive of such reflections was when the King formally opened the\r\nfirst Parliament of Northern Ireland in the same building that had\r\nwitnessed the signing of the Ulster Covenant. Without the earlier event\r\nthe later could not have been. If 1921 could have been fully foreseen in\r\n1912 it might have appeared to many Covenanters as the disappointment of\r\na cherished ideal. But those who lived to listen to the King's Speech in\r\nthe City Hall realised that it was the dissipation of foreboding.\r\nHowever regarded, it was, as King George himself pronounced, \"a\r\nprofoundly moving occasion in Irish history.\"\r\n\r\nThe Speech from the Throne in which these words occurred made a deep\r\nimpression all over the world, and nowhere more than in Ulster itself.\r\nNo people more ardently shared the touchingly expressed desire of the\r\nKing that his coming to Ireland might \"prove to be the first step\r\ntowards an end of strife amongst her people, whatever their race or\r\ncreed.\" So, too, when His Majesty told the Ulster Parliament that he\r\n\"felt assured they would do their utmost to make it an instrument of\r\nhappiness and good government for all parts of the community which they\r\nrepresented,\" the Ulster people believed that the King's confidence in\r\nthem would not prove to have been misplaced.\r\n\r\nHappily, no prophetic vision of those things that were shortly to come\r\nto pass broke in to disturb the sense of satisfaction with the haven\r\nthat had been reached. The future, with its treachery, its alarms, its\r\nfresh causes of uncertainty and of conflict, was mercifully hidden from\r\nthe eyes of the Ulster people when they acclaimed the inauguration of\r\ntheir Parliament by their King. They accepted responsibility for the\r\nefficient working of institutions thus placed in their keeping by the\r\nhighest constitutional Authority in the British Empire, although they\r\nhad never asked for them, and still believed that the system they had\r\nbeen driven to abandon was better than the new; and they opened this\r\nfresh chapter in their history in firm faith that what had received so\r\nstriking a token of the Sovereign's sympathy and approval would never be\r\ntaken from them except with their own consent.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[104] See Letter from Mr. Lloyd George to Mr. Bonar Law, published in\r\nthe Press on November 18th, 1918.\r\n\r\n[105] Precisely twenty-four months later this outrage was committed by\r\nMr. Lloyd George himself, with the concurrence of Mr. Austen\r\nChamberlain.\r\n\r\n[106] _Ante_, p. 248.\r\n\r\n[107] See _ante_, p. 51.\r\n\r\n[108] _The Morning Post_, June 23rd, 1921.\r\n\r\n[109] See _ante_, Chapter XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nNATIONALIST LETTER TO PRESIDENT WILSON\r\n\r\nTo THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nWhen, a century and a half ago, the American Colonies dared to assert\r\nthe ancient principle that the subject should not be taxed without the\r\nconsent of his representatives, England strove to crush them. To-day\r\nEngland threatens to crush the people of Ireland if they do not accept a\r\ntax, not in money but in blood, against the protest of their\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nDuring the American Revolution the champions of your liberties appealed\r\nto the Irish Parliament against British aggression, and asked for a\r\nsympathetic judgment on their action. What the verdict was, history\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nTo-day it is our turn to appeal to the people of America. We seek no\r\nmore fitting prelude to that appeal than the terms in which your\r\nforefathers greeted ours:\r\n\r\n     \"We are desirous of possessing the good opinion of the virtuous and\r\n     humane. We are peculiarly desirous of furnishing you with the true\r\n     state of our motives and objects, the better to enable you to judge\r\n     of our conduct with accuracy, and determine the merits of the\r\n     controversy with impartiality and precision.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Irish race had been conscriptable by England in the war against\r\nthe United Colonies is it certain that your Republic would to-day\r\nflourish in the enjoyment of its noble Constitution?\r\n\r\nSince then the Irish Parliament has been destroyed, by methods described\r\nby the greatest of British statesmen as those of \"black-guardism and\r\nbaseness.\" Ireland, deprived of its protection and overborne by more\r\nthan six to one in the British Lower House, and by more than a hundred\r\nto one in the Upper House, is summoned by England to submit to a\r\nhitherto-unheard-of decree against her liberties.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth year of a war ostensibly begun for the defence of small\r\nnations, a law conscribing the manhood of Ireland has been passed, in\r\ndefiance of the wishes of our people. The British Parliament, which\r\nenacted it, had long outrun its course, being in the eighth year of an\r\nexistence constitutionally limited to five. To warrant the coercive\r\nstatute, no recourse was had to the electorate of Britain, much less to\r\nthat of Ireland. Yet the measure was forced through within a week,\r\ndespite the votes of Irish representatives, and under a system of\r\nclosure never applied to the debates which established conscription for\r\nGreat Britain on a milder basis.\r\n\r\nTo repel the calumnies invented to becloud our action, we venture to\r\naddress the successors of the belligerents who once appealed to Ireland.\r\nThe feelings which inspire America deeply concern our race; so, in the\r\nforefront of our remonstrance, we feel bound to set forth that this\r\nConscription Act involves for Irishmen questions far larger than any\r\naffecting mere internal politics. They raise a sovereign principle\r\nbetween a nation that has never abandoned her independent rights, and an\r\nadjacent nation that has persistently sought to strangle them.\r\n\r\nWere Ireland to surrender that principle, she must submit to a usurped\r\npower, condone the fraudulent prostration of her Parliament in 1800, and\r\nabandon all claim to distinct nationality. Deep-seated and far-reaching\r\nare the problems remorselessly aroused by the unthinking and violent\r\ncourses taken at Westminster.\r\n\r\nThus the sudden and unlooked-for departure of British politicians from\r\ntheir past military procedure towards this island provokes acutely the\r\nfundamental issue of Self-determination. That issue will decide whether\r\nour whole economic, social, and political life must lie at the\r\nuncontrolled disposition of another race whose title to legislate for us\r\nrests on force and fraud alone.\r\n\r\nIreland is a nation more ancient than England, and is one of the oldest\r\nin Christendom. Its geographical boundaries are clearly defined. It\r\ncherishes its own traditions, history, language, music, and culture. It\r\nthrobs with a national consciousness sharpened not only by religious\r\npersecution, but by the violation of its territorial, juristic, and\r\nlegislative rights. The authority of which its invaders boasted rests\r\nsolely on an alleged Papal Bull. The symbols of attempted conquest are\r\nroofless castles, ruined abbeys, and confiscated cathedrals.\r\n\r\nThe title of King of Ireland was first conferred on the English monarch\r\nby a statute of the Parliament held in Ireland in 1542, when only four\r\nof our counties lay under English sway. That title originated in no\r\nEnglish enactment. Neither did the Irish Parliament so originate. Every\r\nmilitary aid granted by that Parliament to English kings was purely\r\nvoluntary. Even when the Penal Code denied representation to the\r\nmajority of the Irish population, military service was never enforced\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nFor generations England claimed control over both legislative and\r\njudicial functions in Ireland, but in 1783 these pretensions were\r\naltogether renounced, and the sovereignty of the Irish Legislature was\r\nsolemnly recognised. A memorable British statute declared it--\r\n\r\n     \"Established and ascertained for ever, and shall at no time\r\n     hereafter be questioned or questionable.\"\r\n\r\nFor this, the spirit evoked by the successful revolt of the United\r\nStates of America is to be thanked, and Ireland won no mean return for\r\nthe sympathy invited by your Congress. Yet scarcely had George III\r\nsignified his Royal Assent to that \"scrap of paper,\" when his Ministers\r\nbegan to debauch the Irish Parliament. No Catholic had, for over a\r\ncentury, been allowed to sit within its walls; and only a handful of the\r\npopulation enjoyed the franchise. In 1800, by shameless bribery, a\r\nmajority of corrupt Colonists was procured to embrace the London\r\nsubjugation and vote away the existence of their Legislature for\r\npensions, pelf, and titles.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the Act of Union, however, sought to soften its shackles\r\nby limiting the future jurisdiction of the British Parliament. Imposed\r\non \"a reluctant and protesting nation,\" it was tempered by articles\r\nguaranteeing Ireland against the coarser and more obvious forms of\r\ninjustice. To guard against undue taxation, \"exemptions and abatements\"\r\nwere stipulated for; but the \"predominant partner\" has long since\r\ndishonoured that part of the contract, and the weaker side has no power\r\nto enforce it. No military burdens were provided for, although Britain\r\nframed the terms of the treaty to her own liking. That an obligation to\r\nyield enforced service was thereby undertaken has never hitherto been\r\nasserted. We therefore cannot neglect to support this protest by citing\r\na main proviso of the Treaty of Union. Before the destruction of the\r\nIrish Parliament no standing army or navy was raised, nor was any\r\ncontribution made, except by way of gift, to the British Army or Navy.\r\nNo Irish law for the levying of drafts existed; and such a proposal was\r\ndeemed unconstitutional. Hence the 8th Article of the Treaty provides\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n     \"All laws in force at the time of the Union shall remain as now by\r\n     law established, subject only to such alterations and regulations\r\n     from time to time as circumstances may appear to the Parliament of\r\n     the United Kingdom to require.\"\r\n\r\nWhere there was no law establishing military service for Ireland, what\r\n\"alteration or regulation\" respecting such a law can legally bind? Can\r\nan enactment such as Conscription, affecting the legal and moral rights\r\nof an entire people, be described as an \"alteration\" or \"regulation\"\r\nspringing from a pre-existing law? Is the Treaty to be construed as\r\nBritain pleases, and always to the prejudice of the weaker side?\r\n\r\nBritish military statecraft has hitherto rigidly held by a separate\r\ntradition for Ireland. The Territorial military system, created in 1907\r\nfor Great Britain, was not set up in Ireland. The Irish Militia was then\r\nactually disbanded, and the War Office insisted that no Territorial\r\nforce to replace it should be embodied. Stranger still, the Volunteer\r\nActs (Naval or Military) from 1804 to 1900 (some twenty in all) were\r\nnever extended to Ireland. In 1880, when a Conservative House of Commons\r\nagreed to tolerate volunteering, the measure was thrown out by the House\r\nof Lords on the plea that Irishmen must not be allowed to learn the use\r\nof arms.\r\n\r\nFor, despite the Bill of Rights, the privilege of free citizens to bear\r\narms in self-defence has been refused to us. The Constitution of America\r\naffirms that right as appertaining to the common people, but the men of\r\nIreland are forbidden to bear arms in their own defence. Where, then,\r\nlies the basis of the claim that they can be forced to take them up for\r\nthe defence of others?\r\n\r\nIt will suffice to present such considerations in outline without\r\ndisinterring the details of the past misgovernment of our country. Mr.\r\nGladstone avowed that these were marked by \"every horror and every shame\r\nthat could disgrace the relations between a strong country and a weak\r\none.\" After an orgy of Martial Law the Scottish General, Abercromby,\r\nCommander-in-Chief in Ireland, wrote: \"Every crime, every cruelty that\r\ncould be committed by Cossacks or Calmucks has been transacted here....\r\nThe abuses of all kinds I found can scarcely be believed or enumerated.\"\r\nLord Holland recalls that many people \"were sold at so much a head to\r\nthe Prussians.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall, therefore, pass by the story of the destruction of our\r\nmanufactures, of artificial famines, of the fomentation of uprisings, of\r\na hundred Coercion Acts, culminating in the perpetual \"Act of\r\nRepression\" obtained by forgery, which graced Queen Victoria's Jubilee\r\nYear in 1887. In our island the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, the\r\nrepression of free speech, gibbetings, shootings, and bayonetings, are\r\ncommonplace events. The effects of forced emigration and famine American\r\ngenerosity has softened; and we do not seek a verdict on the general\r\nmerits of a system which enjoys the commendation of no foreigner except\r\nAlbert, Prince Consort, who declared that the Irish \"were no more worthy\r\nof sympathy than the Poles.\"\r\n\r\nIt is known to you how our population shrank to its present fallen\r\nstate. Grants of money for emigration, \"especially of families,\" were\r\nprovided even by the Land Act of 1881. Previous Poor Law Acts had\r\nstimulated this \"remedy.\" So late as 1891 a \"Congested District\" Board\r\nwas empowered to \"aid emigration,\" although millions of Irishmen had in\r\nthe nineteenth century been evicted from their homes or driven abroad.\r\n\r\nSeventy years ago our population stood at 8,000,000, and, in the normal\r\nratio of increase, it should to-day amount to 16,000,000. Instead, it\r\nhas dwindled to 4,500,000; and it is from this residuum that our manhood\r\nbetween the ages of eighteen and fifty-one is to be delivered up in such\r\nmeasure as the strategists of the English War Cabinet may demand.\r\n\r\nTo-day, as in the days of George Washington, nearly half the American\r\nforces have been furnished from the descendants of our banished race. If\r\nEngland could not, during your Revolution, regard that enrolment with\r\nsatisfaction, might she not set something now to Ireland's credit from\r\nthe racial composition of your Army or Navy? No other small nation has\r\nbeen so bereft by law of her children, but in vain for Ireland has the\r\nbread of exile been thrown upon the waters.\r\n\r\nYet, while Self-determination is refused, we are required by law to\r\nbleed to \"make the world safe for democracy \"--in every country except\r\nour own. Surely this cannot be the meaning of America's message to\r\nmankind glowing from the pen of her illustrious President?\r\n\r\nIn the 750 years during which the stranger sway has blighted Ireland her\r\npeople have never had occasion to welcome an unselfish or generous deed\r\nat the hands of their rulers. Every so-called \"concession\" was but the\r\nloosening of a fetter. Every benefit sprang from a manipulation of our\r\nown money by a foreign Treasury denying us an honest audit of accounts.\r\nNone was yielded as an act of grace. All were the offspring of\r\nconstraint, tumult, or political necessity. Reason and arguments fell on\r\ndeaf ears. To England the Union has brought enhanced wealth, population,\r\npower, and importance; to Ireland increased taxation, stunted\r\nindustries, swollen emigration, and callous officialism.\r\n\r\nPossessing in this land neither moral nor intellectual pre-eminence, nor\r\nany prestige derived from past merit or present esteem, the British\r\nExecutive claims to restrain our liberties, control our fortunes, and\r\nexercise over our people the power of life and death. To obstruct the\r\nrecent Home Rule Bill it allowed its favourites to defy its Parliament\r\nwithout punishment, to import arms from suspect regions with impunity,\r\nto threaten \"to break every law\" to effectuate their designs to infect\r\nthe Army with mutiny and set up a rival Executive backed by military\r\narray to enforce the rule of a caste against the vast majority of the\r\npeople. The highest offices of State became the guerdon of the\r\norganisers of rebellion, boastful of aid from Germany. To-day they are\r\npillars of the Constitution, and the chief instrument of law. The only\r\nlaurels lacking to the leaders of the Mutineers are those transplanted\r\nfrom the field of battle!\r\n\r\nAre we to fight to maintain a system so repugnant, and must Irishmen be\r\ncontent to remain slaves themselves after freedom for distant lands has\r\nbeen purchased by their blood?\r\n\r\nHeretofore in every clime, whenever the weak called for a defender,\r\nwherever the flag of liberty was unfurled, that blood freely flowed.\r\nProfiting by Irish sympathy with righteous causes Britain, at the\r\noutbreak of war, attracted to her armies tens of thousands of our youth\r\nere even the Western Hemisphere had awakened to the wail of \"small\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\nIrishmen, in their chivalrous eagerness, laid themselves open to the\r\nreproach from some of their brethren of forgetting the woes of their own\r\nland, which had suffered from its rulers, at one time or another, almost\r\nevery inhumanity for which Germany is impeached. It was hard to bear the\r\ntaunt that the army they were joining was that which held Ireland in\r\nsubjection; but fresh bitterness has been added to such reproaches by\r\nwhat has since taken place.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the face of persistent discouragements, Irish chivalry\r\nremained ardent and aflame in the first years of the war. Tens of\r\nthousands of the children of the Gael have perished in the conflict.\r\nTheir bones bleach upon the soil of Flanders or moulder beneath the\r\nwaves of Suvla Bay. The slopes of Gallipoli, the sands of Egypt,\r\nMesopotamia and Judasa afford them sepulture. Mons and Ypres provide\r\ntheir monuments. Wherever the battle-line extends from the English\r\nChannel to the Persian Gulf their ghostly voices whisper a response to\r\nthe roll-call of the guardian-spirits of Liberty. What is their reward?\r\n\r\nThe spot on earth they loved best, and the land to which they owed their\r\nfirst duty, and which they hoped their sacrifices might help to freedom,\r\nlies unredeemed under an age-long thraldom. So, too, would it for ever\r\nlie, were every man and every youth within the shores of Ireland to\r\nimmolate himself in England's service, unless the clamour of a dominant\r\ncaste be rebuked and stilled.\r\n\r\nYet proof after proof accumulates that British Cabinets continue to be\r\ntowards our country as conscienceless as ever. They deceive frankly\r\nnations throughout the world as to their Irish policy, while withholding\r\nfrom us even the Act of Home Rule which in 1914 was placed on the\r\nStatute-book. The recent \"Convention,\" which they composed to initiate\r\nreform, was brought to confusion by a letter from the Prime Minister\r\ndiminishing his original engagements.\r\n\r\nSuch insincere manoeuvres have left an indelible sense of wrong rankling\r\nin the hearts of Ireland.\r\n\r\nCapitulations are observed with French Canadians, with the Maltese, with\r\nthe Hindoos, with the Mohammedan Arabs, or the African Boers; but never\r\nhas the word of England, in any capital case, been kept towards the\r\n\"sister\" island.\r\n\r\nThe Parliaments of Australia and of South Africa--both of which (unlike\r\nour ancient Legislature) were founded by British enactments--refused to\r\nadopt conscription. This was well known when the law against Ireland was\r\nresolved on. For opposing the application of that law to Irishmen, and\r\nwhile this appeal to you, sir, was being penned, members of our\r\nConference have been arrested and deported without trial. It was even\r\nsought to poison the wells of American sympathy by levelling against\r\nthem and others an allegation which its authors have failed to submit to\r\nthe investigation of any tribunal.\r\n\r\nTo overlay malpractice by imputing to its victims perverse or criminal\r\nconduct is the stale but never-failing device of tyranny.\r\n\r\nA claim has also been put forward by the British Foreign Office to\r\nprevent you, Mr. President, as the head of a great allied Republic, from\r\nacquiring first-hand information of the reasons why Ireland has\r\nrejected, and will resist, conscription except in so far as the Military\r\nGovernor of Ireland, Field-Marshal Lord French, may be pleased to allow\r\nyou to peruse his version of our opinions.\r\n\r\nAmerica's present conflict with Germany obstructs no argument that we\r\nadvance. \"Liberty and ordered peace\" we, too, strive for; and\r\nconfidently do we look to you, sir, and to America--whose freedom\r\nIrishmen risked something to establish--to lend ear and weight to the\r\nprayer that another unprovoked wrong against the defenceless may not\r\nstain this sorry century.\r\n\r\nWe know that America entered the war because her rights as a neutral, in\r\nrespect of ocean navigation, were interfered with, and only then. Yet\r\nAmerica in her strength had a guarantee that in victory she would not be\r\ncheated of that for which she joined in the struggle. Ireland, having no\r\nsuch strength, has no such guarantee; and experience has taught us that\r\njustice (much less gratitude) is not to be wrung from a hostile\r\nGovernment. What Ireland is to give, a free Ireland must determine.\r\n\r\nWe are sadly aware, from recent proclamations and deportations, of the\r\nefforts of British authorities to inflame prejudice against our country.\r\nWe therefore crave allowance briefly to notice the insinuation that the\r\nIrish coasts, with native connivance, could be made a base for the\r\ndestruction of American shipping.\r\n\r\nAn official statement asserts that:\r\n\r\n     \"An important feature in every plan was the establishment of\r\n     submarine bases in Ireland to menace the shipping of all nations.\"\r\n\r\nOn this it is enough to say that every creek, inlet, or estuary that\r\nindents our shores, and every harbour, mole, or jetty is watchfully\r\npatrolled by British authority. Moreover, Irish vessels, with their\r\ncargoes, crews, and passengers, have suffered in this war\r\nproportionately to those of Britain.\r\n\r\nAnother State Paper palliates the deportations by blazoning the descent\r\nof a solitary invader upon a remote island on the 12th of April,\r\nheralded by mysterious warnings from the Admiralty to the Irish Command.\r\nNo discussion is permitted of the tryst of this British soldier with the\r\nlocal coast-guards, of his speedy bent towards a police barrack, and his\r\nsubsequent confidences with the London authorities.\r\n\r\nOnly one instance exists in history of a project to profane our coasts\r\nby making them a base to launch attacks on international shipping. That\r\nplot was framed, not by native wickedness, but by an English Viceroy,\r\nand the proofs are piled up under his hand in British State Papers.\r\n\r\nFor huge bribes were proffered by Lord Falkland, Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nIreland, to both the Royal Secretary and the Prince of Wales, to obtain\r\nconsent for the use of Irish harbours to convenience Turkish and\r\nAlgerine pirates in raiding sea-going commerce. The plot is old, but the\r\nplea of \"increasing his Majesty's revenues\" by which it was commended is\r\neverlasting. Nor will age lessen its significance for the citizens of\r\nthat Republic which, amidst the tremors and greed of European diplomacy,\r\nextirpated the traffic of Algerine corsairs ninety years ago. British\r\nexperts cherish Lord Falkland's fame as the sire of their most knightly\r\ncavalier, and in their eyes its lustre shines undimmed, though his\r\nExcellency, foiled of marine booty, enriched himself by seizing the\r\nlands of his untried prisoners in Dublin Castle.\r\n\r\nMoving are other retrospects evoked by the present outbreak of malignity\r\nagainst our nation. The slanders of the hour recall those let loose to\r\ncloak previous deportations in days of panic less ignoble. Then it was\r\nthe Primate of All Ireland, Archbishop Oliver Plunkett, who was dragged\r\nto London and arraigned for high treason. Poignant memories quicken at\r\nevery incident which accompanied his degradation before the Lord Chief\r\nJustice of England. A troop of witnesses was suborned to swear that his\r\nGrace \"endeavoured and compassed the King's death,\" sought to \"levy war\r\nin Ireland and introduce a foreign Power,\" and conspired \"to take a view\r\nof all the several ports and places in Ireland where it would be\r\nconvenient to land from France.\" An open trial, indeed, was not denied\r\nhim; but with hasty rites he was branded a base and false traitor and\r\ndoomed to be hanged, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn. That desperate\r\nfelon, after prolonged investigation by the Holy See, has lately been\r\ndeclared a martyr worthy of universal veneration.\r\n\r\nThe fathers of the American Revolution were likewise pursued in turn by\r\nthe venom of Governments. Could they have been snatched from their homes\r\nand haled to London, what fate would have befallen them? There your\r\nnoblest patriots might also have perished amidst scenes of shame, and\r\ntheir effigies would now bedeck a British chamber of horrors. Nor would\r\ndeath itself have shielded their reputations from hatchments of\r\ndishonour. For the greatest of Englishmen reviled even the sacred name\r\nof Joan of Arc, the stainless Maid of France, to belittle a fallen foe\r\nand spice a ribald stage-play.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly thirty years since every Irish leader was made the victim\r\nof a special Statute of Proscription, and was cited to answer vague\r\ncharges before London judges. During 1888 and 1889 a malignant and\r\nunprecedented inquisition was maintained to vilify them, backed by all\r\nthe resources of British power. No war then raged to breed alarms, yet\r\nno weapon that perjury or forgery could fashion was left unemployed to\r\ndestroy the characters of more than eighty National representatives--some\r\nof whom survive to join in this Address. That plot came to an end amidst\r\nthe confusion of their persecutors, but fresh accusations may be daily\r\ncontrived and buttressed by the chicanery of State.\r\n\r\nIn every generation the Irish nation is challenged to plead to a new\r\nindictment, and to the present summons answer is made before no narrow\r\nforum but to the tribunal of the world.

At a time when all the free\r\ndemocracies of the world have, with whatever reluctance, accepted the\r\nburden of conscription as the only alternative to the destruction of\r\nfree institutions and of international justice, it is easily\r\nintelligible that those who maintain Ireland's right to solitary and\r\nprivileged exemption from the same obligation should betray their\r\nconsciousness that an apologia is required to enable them to escape\r\ncondemnation at the bar of civilised, and especially of American,\r\nopinion. But, inasmuch as the document referred to would give to anyone\r\nnot intimately familiar with British domestic affairs the impression\r\nthat it represents the unanimous opinion of Irishmen, it is important\r\nthat your Excellency and the American people should be assured that this\r\nis very far from being the case.\r\n\r\nThere is in Ireland a minority, whom we claim to represent, comprising\r\none-fourth to one-third of the total population of the island, located\r\nmainly, but not exclusively, in the province of Ulster, who dissent\r\nemphatically from the views of Mr. Dillon and his associates. This\r\nminority, through their representatives in Parliament, have maintained\r\nthroughout the present war that the same obligations should in all\r\nrespects be borne by Ireland as by Great Britain, and it has caused them\r\nas Irishmen a keen sense of shame that their country has not submitted\r\nto this equality of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency does not need to be informed that this question has\r\nbecome entangled in the ancient controversy concerning the\r\nconstitutional status of Ireland in the United Kingdom. This is,\r\nindeed, sufficiently clear from the terms of the Nationalist manifesto\r\naddressed to you, every paragraph of which is coloured by allusion to\r\nbygone history and threadbare political disputes.\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention to traverse the same ground. There is in the\r\nmanifesto almost no assertion with regard to past events which is not\r\neither a distortion or a misinterpretation of historical fact. But we\r\nconsider that this is not the moment for discussing the faults and\r\nfollies of the past, still less for rehearsing ancient grievances,\r\nwhether well or ill founded, in language of extravagant rhetoric. At a\r\ntime when the very existence of civilisation hangs in the balance, all\r\nsmaller issues, whatever their merits or however they may affect our\r\ninternal political problems, should in our judgment have remained in\r\nabeyance, while the parties interested in their solution should have\r\njoined in whole-hearted co-operation against the common enemy.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one matter to which reference must be made, in order\r\nto make clear the position of the Irish minority whom we represent. The\r\nNationalist Party have based their claim to American sympathy on the\r\nhistoric appeal addressed to Irishmen by the British colonists who\r\nfought for independence in America a hundred and fifty years ago. By no\r\nIrishmen was that appeal received with a more lively sympathy than by\r\nthe Protestants of Ulster, the ancestors of those for whom we speak\r\nto-day--a fact that was not surprising in view of the circumstance that\r\nmore than one-sixth part of the entire colonial population in America at\r\nthe time of the Declaration of Independence consisted of emigrants from\r\nUlster.\r\n\r\nThe Ulstermen of to-day, forming as they do the chief industrial\r\ncommunity in Ireland, are as devoted adherents to the cause of\r\ndemocratic freedom as were their forefathers in the eighteenth century.\r\nBut the experience of a century of social and economic progress under\r\nthe legislative Union with Great Britain has convinced them that under\r\nno other system of government could more complete liberty be enjoyed by\r\nthe Irish people. This, however, is not the occasion for a reasoned\r\ndefence of \"Unionist\" policy. Our sole purpose in referring to the\r\nmatter is to show, whatever be the merits of the dispute, that a very\r\nsubstantial volume of Irish opinion is warmly attached to the existing\r\nConstitution of the United Kingdom, and regards as wholly unwarranted\r\nthe theory that our political status affords any sort of parallel to\r\nthat of the \"small nations\" oppressed by alien rule, for whose\r\nemancipation the Allied democracies are fighting in this war.\r\n\r\nThe Irish representation in the Imperial Parliament throws a significant\r\nsidelight on this prevalent fiction. Whereas England is only represented\r\nby one member for every 75,000 of population, and Scotland by one for\r\nevery 65,000, Ireland has a member for every 42,000 of her people. With\r\na population below that of Scotland, Ireland has 31 more members in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and 89 more than she could claim on a basis of\r\nrepresentation strictly proportionate to population in the United\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\nSpeaking in Dublin on the 1st of July, 1915, the late Mr. John Redmond\r\ngave the following description of the present condition of Ireland,\r\nwhich offers a striking contrast to the extravagant declamation that\r\nrepresents that country as downtrodden by a harsh and unsympathetic\r\nsystem of government:\r\n\r\n     \"To-day,\" he said, \"the people, broadly speaking, own the soil.\r\n     To-day the labourers live in decent habitations. To-day there is\r\n     absolute freedom in local government and local taxation of the\r\n     country. To-day we have the widest parliamentary and municipal\r\n     franchise. The congested districts, the scene of some of the most\r\n     awful horrors of the old famine days, have been transformed. The\r\n     farms have been enlarged, decent dwellings have been provided, and\r\n     a new spirit of hope and independence is to-day among the people.\r\n     In towns legislation has been passed facilitating the housing of\r\n     the working classes--a piece of legislation far in advance of\r\n     anything obtained for the town tenants of England. We have a system\r\n     of old-age pensions in Ireland whereby every old man and woman over\r\n     seventy is safe from the workhouse and free to spend their last\r\n     days in comparative comfort.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the conditions which, in the eyes of Nationalist politicians,\r\nconstitute a tyranny so intolerable as to justify Ireland in repudiating\r\nher fair share in the burden of war against the enemies of civilisation.\r\n\r\nThe appeal which the Nationalists make to the principle of\r\n\"self-determination\" strikes Ulster Protestants as singularly\r\ninappropriate. Mr. Dillon and his co-signatories have been careful not\r\nto inform your Excellency that it was their own opposition that\r\nprevented the question of Irish Government being settled in accordance\r\nwith that principle in 1916. The British Government were prepared at\r\nthat time to bring the Home Rule Act of 1914 into immediate operation,\r\nif the Nationalists had consented to exclude from its scope the\r\ndistinctively Protestant population of the North, who desired to adhere\r\nto the Union. This compromise was rejected by the Nationalist leaders,\r\nwhose policy was thus shown to be one of \"self-determination\" for\r\nthemselves, combined with coercive domination over us.\r\n\r\nIt is because the British Government, while prepared to concede the\r\nprinciple of self-determination impartially to both divisions in\r\nIreland, has declined to drive us forcibly into such subjection that the\r\nNationalist Party conceive themselves entitled to resist the law of\r\nconscription. And the method by which this resistance has been made\r\neffective is, in our view, not less deplorable than the spirit that\r\ndictated it. The most active opponents of conscription in Ireland are\r\nmen who have been twice detected during the war in treasonable traffic\r\nwith the enemy, and their most powerful support has been that of\r\necclesiastics, who have not scrupled to employ weapons of spiritual\r\nterrorism which have elsewhere in the civilised world fallen out of\r\npolitical use since the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe claim of these men, in league with Germany on the one hand, and with\r\nthe forces of clericalism on the other, to resist a law passed by\r\nParliament as necessary for national defence is, moreover, inconsistent\r\nwith any political status short of independent sovereignty--status which\r\ncould only be attained by Ireland by an act of secession from the United\r\nKingdom, such as the American Union averted only by resort to civil war.\r\nIn every Federal or other Constitution embracing subordinate\r\nlegislatures the raising and control of military forces are matters\r\nreserved for the supreme legislative authority alone, and they are so\r\nreserved for the Imperial Parliament of the United Kingdom in the Home\r\nRule Act of 1914, the \"withholding\" of which during the war is\r\ncomplained of by the Nationalists who have addressed your Excellency.\r\nThe contention of these gentlemen that until the internal government of\r\nIreland is changed in accordance with their demands, Ireland is\r\njustified in resisting the law of Conscription, is one that finds\r\nsupport in no intelligible theory of political science.\r\n\r\nTo us as Irishmen--convinced as we are of the righteousness of the cause\r\nfor which we are fighting, and resolved that no sacrifice can be too\r\ngreat to \"make the world safe for democracy\"--it is a matter of poignant\r\nregret that the conduct of the Nationalist leaders in refusing to lay\r\naside matters of domestic dispute, in order to put forth the whole\r\nstrength of the country against Germany should have cast a stain on the\r\ngood name of Ireland. We have done everything in our power to dissociate\r\nourselves from their action, and we disclaim responsibility for it at\r\nthe bar of posterity and history.\r\n\r\nEDWARD CARSON.\r\nJAMES JOHNSTON, Lord Mayor of Belfast.\r\nH.M.
