As usual most of the women\r\nopposed this plan and as usual Miss Anthony carried the day. The\r\nfollowing letters to Mrs. Spencer, national secretary, will serve as\r\nspecimens of hundreds which she wrote with her own hand, before every\r\nsimilar occasion:\r\n\r\n     I want the rousingest rallying cry ever put on paper--first, to\r\n     call women by the thousand to Chicago; and second, to get every one\r\n     who can not go there to send a postal card to the mass convention,\r\n     saying she wants the Republicans to put a Sixteenth Amendment\r\n     pledge in their platform. Don't you see that if we could have a\r\n     mass meeting of 2,000 or 3,000 earnest women, June 2, and then\r\n     receive 10,000 postals from women all over the country, what a\r\n     tremendous influence we could bring to bear on the Republican\r\n     convention, June 3? We can get Farwell Hall for $40 a day, and I\r\n     think would do well to engage it for the 2d and 3d, then we could\r\n     make it our headquarters--sleep in it even, if we couldn't get any\r\n     other places.\r\n\r\n     Besides this, I want to make the best possible use of all our\r\n     speakers between June 3 and 21, when we shall have a mass meeting\r\n     in Cincinnati, the day before the Democratic convention. My\r\n     proposition is that I, as vice-president-at-large, call conventions\r\n     of two days each at a number of cities. We could divide our\r\n     speakers and thus fill in the entire two weeks between Chicago and\r\n     Cincinnati with capital good work. How does the plan strike you?\r\n     Can we summon the women from the vasty deeps--or distances? Can we\r\n     get 5,000 or 10,000 to send on their postals? Do the petitions\r\n     still come in? How many thousands of appeals and documents have you\r\n     had printed and how many have you sent out?\r\n\r\nAfter the ball was set rolling she wrote:\r\n\r\n     A letter from Mrs. Stanton tells of her being on the verge of\r\n     pneumonia, and rushing home to rest and recruit. She is better and,\r\n     since she has been to the dinner-table, I infer she is well enough\r\n     to begin to work up the thunder and lightning for Indianapolis and\r\n     Chicago. Now won't you at once scratch down the points with which\r\n     you want to fire her soul and brain, and get her at work on the\r\n     resolutions, platform and address? She won't go out to lecture any\r\n     more this spring, and if you will only put her en rapport with your\r\n     thought she will do splendid work in the herculean task awaiting\r\n     us.\r\n\r\n     It is simply impossible for me to go to her at present, and we must\r\n     all give her our ideas in the rough, from time to time, and let her\r\n     weld them together as best she can; and then, as she says, when we\r\n     meet in Indianapolis we all will put in our happiest ideas,\r\n     metaphysical, political, logical and all other \"cals,\" and make\r\n     these the strongest and grandest documents ever issued from any\r\n     organization of women. It does seem to me that if we can succeed in\r\n     grinding out just the right appeal, demand, or whatever it may be\r\n     called, the Republican convention must heed us. At any rate, we\r\n     will do our level best at a strong pull, a long pull and a pull all\r\n     together to compel them to surrender.\r\n\r\n     I enclose my list of May lecture engagements. I shall be able to\r\n     help in money from them soon, and better than I could in any other\r\n     way. I watch both Congress and our State legislatures, but the\r\n     \"scamps\" are vastly better at promising than fulfilling. The\r\n     politicians, of course, expect all this flutter and buncombe about\r\n     doing something for women in New York--in California--in Iowa--is\r\n     going to spike our guns and make us help the Republican party to\r\n     carry all before it; but we must not be thus fooled by them.\r\n\r\nAfter a lecture at Waynesburg, Penn., when she had gone to her train at\r\n4 A. M. to find it an hour late, she wrote on the ticket-office shelf,\r\nby the light of a smoky lamp, this letter to her sister:\r\n\r\n     Just three years ago this day was our dear Hannah's last on earth,\r\n     and I can see her now sitting by the window and can hear her say,\r\n     \"Talk, Susan.\" I knew she wanted me to talk of the future meetings\r\n     in the great beyond, all of them, as she often said, so certain and\r\n     so beautiful to her; but they were not to me, and I could not dash\r\n     her faith with my doubts, nor could I pretend a faith I had not; so\r\n     I was silent in the dread presence of death. Three years--and yet\r\n     what a living presence has she been in my thoughts all the days!\r\n     There has been scarcely one waking hour that I have not felt the\r\n     loss of her. We can not help trying to peer through the veil to\r\n     find the certainty of things over there, but nothing comes to our\r\n     eyes unless we accept the Spiritualistic testimony, which we can\r\n     not wholly do.\r\n\r\n     Well, only you and I are left of mother's four girls, and when and\r\n     how we also shall pass on is among the unknown problems of the\r\n     future. Of course I feel and know that your loss is far beyond\r\n     mine; for never was there a child who so faithfully devoted herself\r\n     to a mother, and made all other interests subserve that mother's\r\n     happiness as did you, and I feel, too, that but for you I never\r\n     could have done my public work.\r\n\r\nThe great series of conventions began with the May Anniversary, which\r\nwas held at Indianapolis, the 25th and 26th, in the Park Theater, Miss\r\nAnthony presiding. All arrangements had been made and all expenses\r\nassumed by the local suffrage society under the leadership of Mrs.\r\nSewall. The Sentinel, edited at that time by Colonel J. B. Maynard,\r\nwelcomed the convention in a strong editorial declaring for woman\r\nsuffrage in unmistakable terms. The very successful meetings closed with\r\na handsome reception tendered by Mrs. John C. New.\r\n\r\nThe mass meeting opened in Farwell Hall, Chicago, June 1, the day before\r\nthe Republican convention, with delegates from twenty-six States, and\r\ncontinued in session three days. The welcoming address was made by\r\nElizabeth Boynton Harbert, the speakers comprised the most prominent\r\nwomen of the nation, the audience numbered 3,000 and the enthusiasm was\r\nunprecedented in all the records of this movement.[1] The History of\r\nWoman Suffrage says:\r\n\r\n     The mass convention had been called for June 2, but the crowds in\r\n     the city gave promise of such extended interest that Farwell Hall\r\n     was engaged for June 1, and before the second day's proceedings\r\n     closed, funds were voluntarily raised by the audience to continue\r\n     the meeting the third day. So vast was the number of letters and\r\n     postals from women who desired to vote, that the whole time of each\r\n     session could have been spent in reading them--one day's mail alone\r\n     bringing them from twenty-three States and three Territories. Some\r\n     contained hundreds of names, others represented town, county and\r\n     State societies. Many were addressed to the different nominating\r\n     conventions, Republican, Greenback, Democratic, while the reasons\r\n     given for desiring to vote ranged from the simple demand, through\r\n     all the scale of those connected with good government and\r\n     morality. So highly important a contribution to history did the\r\n     Chicago Historical Society deem these expressions that it made a\r\n     formal request to be put in possession of all letters and postals,\r\n     with a promise that they should be carefully guarded in a\r\n     fire-proof safe.\r\n\r\nA large parlor in the Palmer House was tendered to the ladies by the\r\nproprietor for business meetings and for a reception room. They were\r\nvisited by a number of Republican delegates, many of whom were\r\nthoroughly in favor of a suffrage plank in the platform and of giving\r\nthe ladies seats in the convention. A letter was sent to the chairman of\r\nthe Republican national committee, Don Cameron, signed by one hundred\r\nand eighteen United States senators and representatives, asking that\r\nseventy-six seats on the floor of the convention be given to as many\r\naccredited delegates from the National Suffrage Association. Although\r\nthe veteran soldiers and sailors were liberally provided for, Mr.\r\nCameron granted only ten seats to the women, and those not to the\r\nassociation in its official capacity but as \"guest\" tickets for seats on\r\nthe platform. Miss Anthony was allowed _ten_ minutes before a\r\n_sub_-committee to present the argument for a suffrage plank. It was\r\nfavorably regarded by scattered members of various delegations, but the\r\nplatform was silent on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Republican convention of 1880 did not even adopt the \"recognition\"\r\nplanks of 1872 and 1876, and all the demonstrations of this great mass\r\nmeeting of women had not the slightest influence, because made by a\r\ndisfranchised class. Before closing they adopted a resolution that they\r\nwould support no party which did not endorse the political equality of\r\nwoman; but all the \"support\" which they could give or withhold was not\r\nlikely to be considered of much value by political leaders.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony and four others attended the Greenback-Labor Convention, a\r\nfew days later, in the same city. They were well received. Mrs. Gage\r\nread the suffrage memorial in open session and Miss Anthony was\r\npermitted to address the convention. This privilege was violently\r\nopposed by Dennis Kearney, who said that \"his wife instructed him before\r\nhe left California not to mix up with woman suffragists, and if he did\r\nshe would meet him at the door with a flat-iron when he came home.\"\r\nFailing to frighten the convention with Mrs. Kearney's flat-iron, he\r\ndeclined to hear Miss Anthony's speech and left the hall in disgust. The\r\ncommittee refused to incorporate a suffrage plank in its platform, but\r\nthe next day in convention, after the nominations were concluded, a\r\ndelegate introduced an equal suffrage resolution which passed by a large\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nThe delegates and speakers of the National Association then held\r\nmeetings at Milwaukee, Wis., Bloomington, Ill., Grand Rapids, Mich.,\r\nLafayette and Terre Haute, Ind., and reached Cincinnati in time for the\r\nDemocratic National Convention, June 22. They were received here with\r\nunexpected courtesy. Mayor Prince, of Boston, and Mr. Eaton, of Kansas,\r\npresented their request for seats, and sixteen were granted them on the\r\nfloor of the house, just behind the delegates. A committee room was\r\nplaced at their disposal and their notices and placards were printed by\r\nthe convention. A hearing was given before the platform committee, with\r\nno limit as to time, and after several had spoken the others were\r\ninvited to do so. The chairman, Henry Watterson, declared himself in\r\nfavor of the plank desired. The delegations from Maine, New York and\r\nKansas also were favorable. Miss Anthony was escorted to the platform\r\nupon the arm of Carter Harrison, amid wild applause, given a seat beside\r\nthe presiding officer, Wade Hampton, and the clerk was ordered to read\r\nthe address which she presented.[2] After all this parade, however, the\r\nplatform contained not the slightest reference to the claims of women\r\nor, in fact, to their existence. The results of the appeal to the\r\nRepublican and Democratic conventions were precisely the same, except\r\nthat the latter administered the dose with chivalry.\r\n\r\nThe National Prohibition Convention at Bloomington, Ill., officially\r\ninvited the suffrage advocates to meet with them and participate in\r\ntheir proceedings. Phoebe Couzins was sent as a delegate, and the\r\nconvention adopted the following plank: \"We also demand that women\r\nhaving privileges as citizens in other respects, shall be clothed with\r\nthe ballot for their own protection, and as a rightful means for the\r\nproper settlement of the liquor question.\" This body, it will be\r\nnoticed, not only demanded the ballot for woman but told her what she\r\nwould be expected to do with it.\r\n\r\nWhile not at all surprised, Miss Anthony was greatly disgusted with the\r\naction of the Republican and Democratic conventions, but, determined to\r\nleave nothing undone, she soon afterwards called upon General Garfield\r\nat Mentor. He was cordial and expressed himself in favor of equality for\r\nwoman in matters of education, work, wages and civil rights, but was not\r\nready to declare himself in favor of the suffrage and, as was always the\r\ncase, urged that the issue be not pressed during _that_ campaign. Mrs.\r\nBlake and others visited General Hancock, the Democratic candidate, and\r\nthe New York Sun reports the interview in part:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Blake said the delegation had come to ask the general what\r\n     hope the woman suffrage party might entertain in case any measure\r\n     came before him, as President, which bore upon granting women the\r\n     ballot. The general replied that the movement was a growing one,\r\n     and that everything which tended toward the amelioration of woman's\r\n     condition had his sympathy. In the course of conversation he said\r\n     that women should be paid equally with men for the same work\r\n     equally well performed.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Slocum said that the delegation desired a decided expression\r\n     from him as to whether he would or would not veto any measure\r\n     favorable to woman suffrage that might come before him as\r\n     President. The general replied that if such a measure were voted\r\n     upon by Congress as a constitutional amendment, it would not come\r\n     before the President. If, however, Congress accorded women the\r\n     right to vote in the District of Columbia, he certainly would offer\r\n     no obstruction.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Blake asked if he considered women as \"people.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Undoubtedly,\" replied the general. \"He would be a bold man who\r\n     would undertake to say they were not.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Then, general,\" said Mrs. Blake, \"we ask nothing more than what\r\n     you say in your letter of acceptance: 'It is only by a full vote,\r\n     a free ballot and a fair count that the people can rule in fact, as\r\n     required by the theory of our government.'\"\r\n\r\n     \"I am perfectly willing,\" said General Hancock, \"that you should\r\n     say I take my stand on that paragraph in my letter of acceptance.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to exhaust every resource, Miss Anthony, on August 17,\r\naddressed this letter to each of the presidential candidates:\r\n\r\n     As vice-president-at-large of the National Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association, I am instructed to ask you if, in the event of your\r\n     election, you, as President of the United States, would recommend\r\n     to Congress the submission to the several legislatures of a\r\n     Sixteenth Amendment to the National Constitution, prohibiting the\r\n     disfranchisement of United States citizens on account of sex. What\r\n     we wish to ascertain is whether you, as President, would use your\r\n     _official influence_ to secure to the women of the several States a\r\n     _national guarantee_ of their right to a voice in the government on\r\n     the same terms with men. Neither platform makes any pledge to\r\n     secure political equality to women--hence we are waiting and hoping\r\n     that one candidate or the other, or both, will declare favorably,\r\n     and thereby make it possible for women, with self-respect, to work\r\n     for the success of one or the other or both nominees. Hoping for a\r\n     prompt and explicit statement, I am, sir, very respectfully yours.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hancock did not so much as acknowledge the receipt of this, but\r\nGeneral Garfield answered promptly, writing with his own hand:\r\n\r\n     Your letter of the 17th inst. was duly received. I take the liberty\r\n     of asking your personal advice before I answer your official\r\n     letter. I assume that all the traditions and impulses of your life\r\n     lead you to believe that the Republican party has been and is more\r\n     nearly in the line of liberty than its antagonist, the Democratic\r\n     party; and I know you desire to advance the cause of woman. Now, in\r\n     view of the fact that the Republican convention has not discussed\r\n     your question, do you not think it would be a violation of the\r\n     trust they have reposed in me, to speak \"as their nominee\"--and add\r\n     to the present contest an issue which they have not authorized?\r\n\r\n     Again, if I answer your question on the ground of my own private\r\n     opinion, I shall be compelled to say that, while I am open to the\r\n     freest discussion and fairest consideration of your question, I\r\n     have not yet reached the conclusion that it would be best for woman\r\n     and for the country that she should have the suffrage. I may reach\r\n     it; but whatever time may do to me, that fruit is not yet ripe on\r\n     my tree. I ask you, therefore, for the sake of your own question,\r\n     do you think it wise to pick my apples now? Please answer me in the\r\n     frankness of personal friendship.\r\n\r\n     With kind regards, I am, very truly yours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Please answer me in the frankness of personal\r\nfriendship. With kind regards, I am very truly yours. Garfield\"]\r\n\r\nUnder date of September 9 Miss Anthony sent a spirited reply:\r\n\r\n     Yours of the 25th ult. has waited all these days that I might\r\n     carefully consider it.\r\n\r\n     First.--The Republican party did run well for a season in the \"line\r\n     of liberty,\" but since 1870, its congressional enactments, majority\r\n     reports, Supreme Court decisions, and now its presidential\r\n     platform, show a retrograde movement--not only for women but for\r\n     colored men--limiting the power of the national government in the\r\n     protection of United States citizens against the injustice of the\r\n     States, until what we gained by the sword is lost by political\r\n     surrenders. We need nothing but a Democratic administration to\r\n     demonstrate to all Israel and the sun the fact, the sad fact, that\r\n     all is lost by the Republican party. I mean, of course, the one\r\n     vital point of national supremacy in the protection of United\r\n     States citizens in the enjoyment of their right to vote, and the\r\n     punishment of States or individuals thereof, for depriving citizens\r\n     of the exercise of that right. The first and fatal mistake was in\r\n     ceding to Rhode Island the right to \"abridge\" the suffrage to\r\n     foreign born men; and to all the States to \"deny\" it to women, in\r\n     direct violation of the principle of _national supremacy_. From\r\n     that time, inch by inch, point by point has been surrendered, until\r\n     it is only in name that the Republican party is the party of\r\n     national supremacy. Grant did not protect the negro's ballot in the\r\n     presidential election of 1876--Hayes can not in 1880--nor will\r\n     Garfield be able to do so in 1884--for the \"scepter has departed\r\n     from Judah.\"\r\n\r\n     Second.--For the candidate of a party to add to the discussions of\r\n     the contest an issue unauthorized or unnoted in its platform, when\r\n     that issue is one vital to its very life, it seems to me would be\r\n     the grandest act imaginable. For doing that very thing, with regard\r\n     to the protection of the negroes of the South, you are today\r\n     receiving more praise from the best men of the party than for any\r\n     and all of your utterances inside the line of the platform. I know,\r\n     if you had in your letter of acceptance, or in your New York\r\n     speech, declared yourself in favor of \"perfect equality of rights\r\n     for women, civil and political,\" you would have touched an electric\r\n     spark which would have fired the hearts of the women of the entire\r\n     nation, and made the triumph of the Republican party more grand and\r\n     glorious than any it ever has seen.\r\n\r\n     Third.--As to picking fruit before it is ripe! Allow me to remind\r\n     you that very much fruit is never picked; some is nipped in the\r\n     bud; some is worm-eaten and falls to the ground; some rots on the\r\n     trees before it ripens; some, too slow in ripening, is bitten by\r\n     the early frosts of autumn; while some rare, ripe apples hang until\r\n     frozen and worthless on the leafless boughs! Really, Mr. Garfield,\r\n     if after passing through the war of the rebellion and sixteen years\r\n     in Congress; if after seeing and hearing and repeating that _no\r\n     class_ ever got justice and equality of chances from any government\r\n     except it had the power--the ballot--to clutch them for itself; if\r\n     after all your opportunities for growth and development, you can\r\n     not yet see the truth of the great principle of individual\r\n     self-government; if you have reached only the idea of\r\n     class-government, and that, too, of the most hateful and cruel\r\n     form--bounded by sex--there must be some radical defect in the\r\n     ethics of the party of which you are the chosen leader.\r\n\r\n     No matter which party administers the government, women will\r\n     continue to get only subordinate positions and half pay, not\r\n     because of the party's or the President's lack of chivalric regard,\r\n     but because, in the nature of things, it is impossible for any\r\n     government to protect a disfranchised class in equality of chances.\r\n     Women, to get justice, must have political freedom. But pardon this\r\n     long trespass upon your time and patience, and please bear in mind\r\n     that it is not for the many good things the Republican party and\r\n     its nominee have done in extending the area of liberty that I\r\n     criticise them, but because they have failed to place the women of\r\n     the nation on the plane of political equality with men. I do not\r\n     ask you to go beyond your convictions, but I do most earnestly beg\r\n     you to look at this question from the standpoint of the\r\n     woman--alone, without father, brother, husband, son--battling for\r\n     bread. It is to help the millions of these unfortunate ones that I\r\n     plead for the ballot in the hands of all women.\r\n\r\n     With great respect for your frank and candid talk with one of the\r\n     disfranchised, I am, very sincerely yours.\r\n\r\nOn the strength of Hancock's perfectly non-committal interview and\r\nGarfield's frank letter, several of the prominent Democratic women\r\nrushed into a campaign for that party, whereupon Miss Anthony called\r\nthem down in vigorous language. After expressing her indignation at the\r\nmany false newspaper reports of her correspondence and interview with\r\nGeneral Garfield, she said:\r\n\r\n     He has always stood ready to aid us in getting our demand before\r\n     Congress, and was one of the three who reported in favor of a\r\n     special woman suffrage committee in the House the last session. He\r\n     has actually done a thousand things a thousand times more friendly\r\n     to woman suffrage than Hancock now _talks_ of doing. Then, again,\r\n     Hancock has given us no public statement that, if elected, he will\r\n     recommend a Sixteenth Amendment in his inaugural; and in his\r\n     letter of acceptance he said nothing more that can be twisted into\r\n     suffrage for women than Garfield did in his, and there is no more\r\n     in the Democratic platform that can be thus construed than there is\r\n     in the Republican.\r\n\r\n     I never intended that the National Association should accept any\r\n     sort of \"under the ink or between the lines\" as favorable pledges;\r\n     and before _I_ shall consent to put my name to any document\r\n     favoring either candidate, I must see in black and white, in the\r\n     candidate's own pen tracks, something to warrant such favoring.\r\n     Mere gallantry will not do.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign which followed, neither she nor the other leading\r\nwomen of the country did any public work, and both parties lost the\r\nsplendid services which would have been gladly rendered had they\r\nrecognized the simple principle of justice. When the success of Garfield\r\nwas practically assured, Miss Anthony wrote to a friend on the evening\r\nof election day: \"I am fairly holding my breath tonight, waiting for the\r\nmorning reports, as I feel it will be an overwhelming triumph for the\r\nRepublican party. If their majority should be immense, perhaps it will\r\ngive them courage and strength to speak for woman--and so let us hope\r\nand hope on.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Stanton's health forbade her going on the lecture platform in\r\nthe autumn of 1880, and as Miss Anthony had now enough money ahead to\r\ndare claim a little leisure from public work, they decided to settle\r\ndown to the serious business of writing the History of Woman Suffrage.\r\nFor this purpose Miss Anthony went to Tenafly in October and ensconced\r\nherself in Mrs. Stanton's cosy home among the \"blue hills of Jersey.\"\r\nThe work already was advanced far enough to show that it could not\r\npossibly be restricted to the one volume into which it had enlarged from\r\nthe 500-page pamphlet at first intended, and the task loomed up in an\r\nappalling manner. Mrs. Elizabeth Thompson, the generous patron of so\r\nmany progressive movements, gave Miss Anthony $1,000 for immediate\r\nexpenses and so they went on with the work, delving among old papers and\r\nletters, compiling, cutting, pasting, writing and re-writing, sending\r\nover and over to the women of different States for local history, going\r\ninto New York again and again to see the publishers, and performing all\r\nthe drudgery demanded by such an undertaking, which can be appreciated\r\nonly by the few who have experienced it.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony hated this kind of work and it was torture for her to give\r\nup her active life and sit poring over the musty records of the past.\r\nHer diary contains the usual impatient expressions of this feeling, and\r\nin her letters to friends she says: \"O, how tired and sick I am of\r\nboning down to facts and figures perpetually, and how I long to be set\r\nfree from what to me has been a perfect prison for the last six months!\"\r\nShe stuck to it with Spartan heroism, however, knowing that otherwise it\r\nnever would be done, but she was not unwilling occasionally to sally\r\nforth and fill a lecture engagement or attend a convention. At the Rhode\r\nIsland annual meeting she made the principal address, and the next day\r\nwent, with Mrs. J. Ellen Foster, to Danbury, Mass., to call on John G.\r\nWhittier. Almost his first words were, \"And so our dear Lucretia Mott is\r\ngone!\" She had died the evening before, November 11, aged nearly\r\neighty-eight.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony had expected her death, but was inexpressibly grieved to\r\nlose from out her life that sweet presence which had been an inspiration\r\nfor thirty years, whose staunch support had never failed, even when\r\nfriends were fewest and fortune at its lowest ebb. In times of greatest\r\nperplexity she could slip down to the Philadelphia home for sympathy and\r\nencouragement, and there was always a corner in the pocketbook from\r\nwhich a contribution came when it was most needed. If ever any human\r\ncharacter was without a flaw it was that of Lucretia Mott. Her motto was\r\n\"Truth for authority, not authority for truth.\" She faded away like a\r\nspirit and her dying words, whispered many times during the last day or\r\ntwo, were, \"O, let me go, let this little standard bearer go!\" For\r\nfreedom, for peace, for temperance, for equality, she was indeed the\r\nstandard bearer through all her long and beautiful life.\r\n\r\nOn election day, prompted no doubt by the unconquered and unconquerable\r\nMiss Anthony, Mrs. Stanton made an effort to vote. This act created much\r\nexcitement and called forth columns of comment in the newspapers, to the\r\ngreat amusement of the two conspirators in their quiet retreat.\r\n\r\nToward the end of 1880, Miss Anthony wrote to the treasurer, Mrs.\r\nSpofford, asking if she did not think it would be best to omit the\r\nNational Convention of 1881, giving as reasons that there had been such\r\na surfeit of conventions during the past year and that she was very busy\r\nwith the History. Mrs. Spofford was much surprised, for Miss Anthony\r\nnever had been known to yield in the matter of holding this annual\r\nmeeting, even when all others were opposed, but she advised against\r\npostponement and by the next mail received this reply:\r\n\r\n     I feel exactly as you do about having the convention. I have never\r\n     for a moment felt ready _not_ to hold it. I wrote you under Mrs.\r\n     Stanton's orders not to tell you how I felt, as that would be sure\r\n     to influence you. Now I have read her your letter and told her my\r\n     determination was to go ahead. She won't promise to attend, she\r\n     never does, but I never fail to take her with me when I am on the\r\n     spot, as I shall be when the time comes next January. So you may\r\n     save us each a bedroom away up, no matter how lofty--you know I\r\n     love the fresh air of the high heavens. Don't give yourself one\r\n     moment's uneasiness in regard to the convention. I am going to set\r\n     about it and am bound to make it one of the best, if not the best\r\n     ever held in Washington, and you shall have Mrs. Stanton too,\r\n     unless I miss my guess.\r\n\r\nAt the same time came the following from Mrs. Stanton: \"Your kind\r\ninvitation I fully appreciate, and feel that the pleasure of seeing you\r\nis one of the compensations of these conventions, which I dread more\r\nthan I can tell. But Susan says truly that when she is at hand, she\r\nalways dragoons me into what she considers my duty, so I never venture\r\nto say what I will or will not do. Although I have solemnly vowed I will\r\ngo nowhere this winter, I should not be surprised if I found myself in\r\nLincoln Hall the middle of January.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Harriet Purvis (Signed: \"Harriet Purvis\")]\r\n\r\nThe Thirteenth Annual Convention of the National Association opened\r\nJanuary 18, 1881, Elizabeth Cady Stanton in the chair. The first session\r\nwas devoted to a memorial service for Lucretia Mott. The stage was\r\ndecorated with draperies and flowers and a large portrait of Mrs. Mott\r\nstood on an easel. An exquisite floral harp was presented by the colored\r\ncitizens of the District. In the audience were many distinguished\r\npeople, including Mrs. Hayes and her guests from the White House,\r\nmembers of the Supreme Court and of Congress, and other noted\r\npersonages. The music was rendered by the colored choir of St.\r\nAugustine's Church. Miss Anthony said in part: \"The highest tribute she\r\ncould pay was that during the past thirty years she had always felt sure\r\nshe was right when she had the sanction of Lucretia Mott. Next to that\r\nof her own conscience she most valued the approval of her sainted\r\nfriend; and it was now a great satisfaction that in all the differences\r\nof opinion as to principles and methods in their movement, Mrs. Mott had\r\nstood firmly with the National Association, of which she was, to the day\r\nof her death, the honored and revered vice-president.\" Short and\r\ntouching addresses were made by Mrs. Sewall, Miss Couzins, Frederick\r\nDouglass and Robert Purvis, and the eulogy was delivered by Mrs.\r\nStanton.\r\n\r\nThere was an effort during this convention to secure in Congress a\r\n\"standing committee on the rights of women.\" It was ably advocated by\r\nSenator McDonald and defeated largely through the smooth manipulation of\r\nRoscoe Conkling. The convention closed with a reception and supper for\r\nthe delegates, given by Mrs. Spofford at the Riggs House.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton went from Washington to the home of Mrs.\r\nMott, where they were welcomed by her daughters, who sent for Sarah\r\nPugh, and the old friends had a lovely day, made sacred by reminiscences\r\nof the dear one gone forever. For more than a quarter of a century this\r\nhad been Miss Anthony's stopping-place when in Philadelphia,[3] but she\r\nwas welcomed at once into another beautiful home, that of the wife and\r\ndaughters of J. Heron Foster, founder of the Pittsburg Dispatch. All\r\nwere deeply interested in the great question, and Julia and Rachel\r\nhenceforth were ranked among the most earnest and valued workers.\r\n\r\nIt was soon afterwards that a reporter of the Chicago News started the\r\nfollowing paragraph:\r\n\r\n     Susan B. Anthony has never condescended to love a man but she\r\n     lavishes a heap of affection on a little gray Skye terrier which\r\n     she takes around with her wherever she goes. This dog was given her\r\n     by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and having recently lost a favorite\r\n     Newfoundland pet, she accepted the frolicsome Skye with hearty\r\n     gratitude. She has taught the apt brute every variety of trick and\r\n     its intelligence seems to be unlimited. The little creature sleeps\r\n     on her bed, eats from her hand, has blankets, gold and silver\r\n     collars and every kind of ornament and comfort. Miss Anthony is\r\n     accompanied by this accomplished canine everywhere, and during the\r\n     recent convention in Washington \"Birdie,\" as the dog is called,\r\n     occupied a prominent place on the platform, either cuddled up in\r\n     her voluminous lap or coiled in a frowsy heap at her feet.\r\n\r\nThis was copied into many newspapers throughout the country, often\r\naccompanied by editorial comment, facetious, disapproving, and sometimes\r\ndeducing from this text the solemn fact that every woman's nature must\r\nhave something to love, or that while women were so frivolous they had\r\nno right to ask for the ballot. This extract from a half-column\r\neditorial in the New York Graphic will serve as an example:\r\n\r\n     There is something wrong here. If Miss Anthony were to carry around\r\n     with her a Newfoundland or a good bloodhound the spectacle would\r\n     have nothing incongruous in it. If she would make a pet of a\r\n     six-barrelled revolver and another of a large club that would be\r\n     appropriate. But a Skye terrier, a miserable, little, whining pup,\r\n     a coached, coddled and coaxed dog making repeated journeys in a\r\n     basket and fed on crackers and milk--what sort of a thing is this\r\n     for a person of reformative powers to be associated with? It is an\r\n     argument in favor of woman's rights that women are capable of all\r\n     the masculinity necessary to voting and the making of laws; but who\r\n     ever heard of a President, a senator, a member of the House of\r\n     Representatives, a legislator of any kind, going about with a sick\r\n     dog in his arms, soothing the little wretch into its proper sleep,\r\n     providing it with its regular nourishment and superintending its\r\n     morning awakenings and the accompanying ablutions?\r\n\r\n     Women can never come to the head of the government, can never\r\n     assist to a large extent in its management, until they reform these\r\n     weaknesses. It isn't necessary that they should chew tobacco and\r\n     swear, and perhaps they needn't smoke cigars and drive fast horses;\r\n     but their leaders must abandon the pet dog, the favorite kitten,\r\n     the especial hen and the abominable bird. They may still sew and\r\n     still wear the petticoat; but if they enter politics they must\r\n     submit to the hard raps that men expect, without putting their\r\n     hands to their eyes and sobbing that their feelings have been hurt.\r\n     There must be reform, and Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton must set\r\n     about it in earnest and at once.\r\n\r\n     A Skye terrier for Miss Anthony! Merciful heavens! after all these\r\n     years has it come to this? Catnip for Julius Cæsar! Boneset tea and\r\n     black stockings with garters for Alexander the Great! A locket with\r\n     hair in it on the bosom of the first Napoleon! A Skye terrier! We\r\n     have fallen upon evil days.\r\n\r\nUnder this in her scrap-book Miss Anthony wrote, \"Doesn't this cap the\r\nclimax?\" Of course, there was not the slightest foundation for the\r\nparagraph. Miss Anthony never owned a dog or any pet animal, not from\r\ndislike but because she felt that humanity needed all her time and\r\naffection.\r\n\r\nWork on the History was at once resumed, as its editors were now\r\nconvinced that it never could be finished except by the hardest kind of\r\nlabor without cessation. Of the able assistance rendered by many women\r\nthroughout the country, perhaps that of Clarina Howard Nichols was the\r\nmost valuable. She possessed not only great literary ability but also\r\nthe true editorial instinct and was one of the few left of the \"old\r\nguard.\" Out of her fine memory she wove a number of delightful chapters,\r\nall written while lying on her back an almost helpless invalid and over\r\nseventy years old. She had long ago gone to California to be with her\r\nchildren, and Miss Anthony's weekly letters to her were of the most\r\nloving character and answered in the same affectionate strain. Mrs.\r\nNichols hesitated to use the names of those who had been most violent in\r\ntheir opposition to the rights of women, because she disliked to make\r\ntheir children blush for them, but Miss Anthony wrote:\r\n\r\n     History ought to be true, and the men and women who at the time\r\n     enjoyed the glory of opposing us ought to be known to posterity\r\n     even if it is to their children's sorrow; just as those who\r\n     suffered the torments of ridicule and hatred then, now enjoy the\r\n     rewards, and their children and grandchildren glory in their\r\n     ancestors. Robert Dale Owen's daughter, in writing up the Indiana\r\n     Constitutional Convention and her father's opponents, withheld\r\n     their names from sympathy for their children. I have told her, that\r\n     as she now rejoices in what was then considered her father's\r\n     reproach, so she should let the children of those men hang their\r\n     heads now for what then was their father's pride. Isn't that fair?\r\n     Garrison used to say, \"Where there is a sin, there must be a\r\n     sinner.\" When people understand that their descendants and all\r\n     Israel will know of their deeds, a hundred years hence, maybe they\r\n     will learn to be and do better.\r\n\r\n     I am a genuine believer in the doctrine of letting the seed bear\r\n     its fruit on the sower's own ground. For us not to give the names\r\n     of our opponents, but only of those who were wise and good, not\r\n     only would not be true history, but would rob the book of one-half\r\n     its interest. If all persons felt that their children must suffer\r\n     for their wrong-doings, they would be more cautious, but the belief\r\n     that all their ill record is to be hidden out of sight helps them\r\n     to go on reckless of truth and justice. It is not in malice or\r\n     with a desire to make any one suffer, but to be true to history\r\n     that every name should stand and be judged as the facts merit.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony in reality seldom carried out this theory, but usually\r\ndesired that personal failings should not be recorded and handed down to\r\nposterity. She scarcely could be persuaded to allow the bare facts in\r\nmany instances to be stated lest surviving relatives should be hurt\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing where the money was to be obtained for publishing the\r\nHistory but determined that it should be done, Miss Anthony pushed on\r\nthe work. The steel engravings cost $126 apiece and where women were\r\nunable or unwilling to pay for their own, she herself assumed the\r\nresponsibility. To Mrs. Nichols she wrote: \"I shall have your picture\r\nand that of Ernestine L. Rose if it takes the last drop in the\r\nbucket.\"[4] Because of the unpopularity of the subject the large firms\r\nwould not consider the publication of this work, which it was now found\r\nwould fill two huge volumes, but arrangements were concluded finally\r\nwith Fowler & Wells. In their great anxiety to get their work before the\r\npublic while they yet lived to see it properly done, each chapter was\r\nhurried to the publishers the moment it was completed and immediately\r\nstereotyped and printed, which made revising, condensing and\r\nre-arranging impossible.\r\n\r\nThe first volume was issued in May, 1881, a royal octavo of 900 pages,\r\nbringing the record down to the beginning of the Civil War. It is not an\r\nexaggeration to say that no history during the century had been more\r\nfavorably received by the press. The New York dailies contained from one\r\nto two or more columns of most complimentary reviews. The National\r\nCitizen and Ballot-Box gave up almost an entire edition to notices of\r\nthe History taken from New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and other\r\npapers, with not a disparaging criticism. Most of them echoed the\r\nsentiment of the New York Sun: \"We have long needed an authentic and\r\nexhaustive account of the movement for the enfranchisement of women;\"\r\nand of the Chicago News: \"The appearance of this book, long expected by\r\nthe friends, is not only an important literary occurrence, but it is a\r\nremarkable event in the history of civilization.\" The personal\r\ncommendations from such men as President Andrew D. White, of Cornell\r\nUniversity, Hon. C. B. Waite, of Chicago, Rev. William Henry Channing,\r\nand from scores of eminent women, would in themselves require several\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nNobody realized so well as the authors the imperfections of the work,\r\nbut when one considered that it had to be gathered piecemeal from old\r\nletters, personal recollections, imperfect newspaper reports, mere\r\nscraps of material which never had been put into shape as to time and\r\nplace, the result was remarkable. They were indeed correct in their\r\nassertion that no one but the actual participants ever could have\r\ndescribed the early history of this movement to secure equal rights for\r\nwomen. \"We have furnished the bricks and mortar,\" they said, \"for some\r\nfuture architect to rear a beautiful edifice.\" These \"bricks and mortar\"\r\nwere supplied almost wholly by Miss Anthony, who, from the beginning,\r\nhad carefully preserved every letter, newspaper clipping and report, and\r\nwhose persistent and endless labor in collecting facts, dates, etc.,\r\nnever can be estimated or sufficiently appreciated; and it is not\r\nprobable that any more forcible or graceful pens than those of Mrs.\r\nStanton and Mrs. Gage ever will be found to enhance their splendid work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Truly yours as ever, Matilda Joslyn Gage\"]\r\n\r\nSo unanimous and hearty was the reception of this book, to which they\r\nhad devoted every moment of spare time for five years, that they felt\r\nencouraged to spend the next five, if necessary, upon the other volume,\r\nwhich the mass of material now demanded; but if all the criticism had\r\nbeen unfavorable and everybody had declared the work not needed, they\r\nstill would have gone straight on to the finish, because they realized\r\nso strongly the value of putting into permanent form the story of the\r\nstruggle for the emancipation of woman. Many letters were received\r\nurging that it was too soon to write this history, to which Mrs. Stanton\r\ninvariably responded in her humorous way: \"Well, we old workers might\r\nperhaps have 'reminisced' after death, but I doubt if the writing\r\nmediums could do as well as we have done with our pens. You say the\r\nhistory of woman suffrage can not be written until it is accomplished.\r\nWhy not describe its initiative steps? The United States has not\r\ncompleted its grand experiment of equality, universal suffrage, etc.,\r\nand yet Bancroft has been writing our history for forty years. If no one\r\nwrites up his own times, where are the materials for the history of the\r\nfuture?\"\r\n\r\nBefore the task should be resumed, however, there must be a little rest\r\nand a great deal of work of another kind. The diary says: \"Had a man\r\ntoday and toted all my documents out to the barn, storing them in big\r\nboxes, then packed my winter clothes away in the attic, so that my room\r\nmight be renovated for Theodore Stanton and his bride from Paris.\" Miss\r\nAnthony then returned home, filled several lecture engagements and in\r\nMay started for Massachusetts, stopping at Tenafly to take Mrs. Stanton\r\nwith her in order that she might not escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The Chicago press gave very satisfactory reports of this meeting,\r\nbut the Springfield Republic was vulgar and abusive, called the ladies\r\n\"withered beldames,\" \"cats on the back roof,\" and advised them to \"go\r\nhome and attend to their children, if they had any, and if not, to\r\nengage in that same occupation as soon as they could regularly do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe charge being so often made that the leaders of the suffrage movement\r\nwere a lot of old maids and childless wives, Miss Anthony prepared a\r\nlist showing that sixteen of the most prominent were the mothers of\r\nsixty-six children. Of the pioneers she herself was the only one who\r\nnever married. Of the younger speakers Phoebe Couzins was the only one\r\nwho remained single.\r\n\r\n[2] The Cincinnati Commercial said at this time: \"Miss Anthony is the\r\nsame clear, calm reasoner--a woman of the same firm convictions and with\r\nthe same forcible, dignified and essentially womanly manner of\r\nexpressing them--that she has always been. While in Cincinnati she is\r\nthe guest of her cousin, Mrs. A. B. Merriam, of Walnut Hills, where many\r\ncall upon her and find a talk with a woman so earnest and fine in\r\nintellectual power to be a genuine satisfaction. On the 'woman\r\nquestion,' she is hopeful but not a hopeless enthusiast. She is too\r\nclear-headed for that, and has overcome too many obstacles not to\r\nappreciate the requisite momentum and the force necessary to produce it.\r\nHer life is great in that it has made a larger life and higher work\r\npossible to other women, who share her aspirations without her\r\ninvincible strength to carve their way.\"\r\n\r\n[3] This and the hospitable homes of Robert and Harriet Purvis, Sarah\r\nPugh, and Adeline and Annie Thomson, sisters of J. Edgar Thomson.\r\n\r\n[4] The women of Kansas contributed $75 toward Mrs. Nichols' picture as\r\na testimonial to her suffrage work in that State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE LEGACY--NEBRASKA CAMPAIGN--OFF FOR EUROPE.\r\n\r\n1881-1882-1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been decided this year of 1881 to take the anniversary meeting\r\ninto the very heart of New England, and for the first time the National\r\nAssociation went to Boston, opening in Tremont Temple, May 26. The\r\naddress of welcome was made by Harriet H. Robinson, wife of\r\n\"Warrington,\" the well-known newspaper correspondent, and there were\r\nseveral new speakers in the convention, including A. Bronson Alcott,\r\nMary F. Eastman, Anna Garlin Spencer, Frank Sanborn, ex-Governor Lee, of\r\nWyoming, the noted politician, Francis W. Bird, Harriette Robinson\r\nShattuck and Rev. Ada C. Bowles. The ladies had no cause to complain of\r\nthe hospitality of this conservative New England center. The Boston\r\nTraveller expressed the general sentiment in saying:\r\n\r\n     The National Suffrage Association has reason to congratulate itself\r\n     on one of the most notable and successful conventions ever held.\r\n     Boston's attitude to her distinguished guests has been uniformly\r\n     hospitable, the audiences have been large and enthusiastic, the\r\n     press co-operative in every sense. The eminent women who are its\r\n     leaders are ladies whose acquaintance is an unmixed pleasure, and\r\n     not least in importance have been the friendships formed and\r\n     renewed at this meeting. The business management of the convention\r\n     has been superb; the sympathy between audience and speakers\r\n     reciprocal.\r\n\r\nThe guests received an invitation from Governor John D. Long to visit\r\nthe State House and were received by him in person. In his remarks he\r\nsaid he believed women should vote, not because they are women but\r\nbecause they are a part of the people and government should be of the\r\npeople regardless of sex; he thought the extension of suffrage to women\r\ncould not fail to give stability to the government. Mrs. Hooker thanked\r\nhim for coming to their support and in her letter describing the\r\noccurrence she says: \"Miss Anthony standing close to the governor said\r\nin low; pathetic tones, 'Yes, we are tired, we are weary with our work.\r\nFor thirty years some of us have carried this burden, and now if we\r\nmight put it in the hands of honorable men, such as you, how happy we\r\nwould be.'\" The ladies also accepted an invitation from Mayor Prince to\r\nvisit the city hall and were cordially received by him. They were\r\ninvited to inspect the great dry goods store of Jordan, Marsh & Co. and\r\nsee the arrangements for the comfort and pleasure of the employes many\r\nof whom were women. Miss Anthony, Mrs. Stanton and Mrs. Robinson were\r\nentertained at the Parker House by the famous Bird Club.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony received several beautiful floral offerings during the\r\nconvention, and also a handsome pin in the shape of a Greek cross. The\r\ngolden bar from which it was suspended bore the letters S. B. A., on the\r\npoints were the initials N. W. S. A., and on the reverse was engraved,\r\n\"Presented by the Citizens' Suffrage Association of Philadelphia as a\r\ntoken of gratitude for her life-long devotion to the interests of\r\nwoman.\" The little presentation speech was made in a most tender and\r\ngraceful manner by May Wright Sewall. The Boston Globe in describing the\r\nscene pays this compliment:\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony was as deeply touched as she was surprised. Recovering\r\n     herself, she responded eloquently and in her usual interesting and\r\n     magnetic manner. Of all the eminent women who are here, no one is\r\n     such a favorite with a Boston audience as Susan B. Anthony. Her\r\n     courage and strength and the patient devotion of a life consecrated\r\n     to the advancement and the elevation of womanhood, her invincible\r\n     honor, her logic and her power to touch and sway all hearts, are\r\n     felt and reverently recognized. The young women of the day may well\r\n     feel that it is she who _has made life possible_ to them; who has\r\n     trodden the thorny paths and, by her unwearied devotion, has opened\r\n     to them the professions and higher applied industries; nor is this\r\n     detracting from those who now share with her the labor and the\r\n     glory. Each and all recognize the individual devotion, the purity\r\n     and singleness of purpose that so eminently distinguish Miss\r\n     Anthony.\r\n\r\nThe convention closed with a reception at the elegant home of Mrs. Fenno\r\nTudor, on Beacon Hill.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Boston, this distinguished body of women, made the sweep\r\nof New England, holding conventions in Providence, R. I.; Portland, Me.;\r\nDover, Concord and Keene, N. H.; Hartford and New Haven, Conn. The\r\nnational board of officers received an infusion of new blood this year\r\nthrough the election of May Wright Sewall, chairman executive committee,\r\nand Rachel Foster, corresponding secretary. Miss Anthony writes, \"It is\r\nsuch a relief to roll off part of the burden on stronger, younger\r\nshoulders.\" This entire round of conventions was arranged by Miss\r\nFoster, a remarkable work for an inexperienced girl.\r\n\r\nAt Concord Miss Anthony was entertained in the family of her old friend\r\nand co-laborer, Parker Pillsbury, and after her departure Mrs. Pillsbury\r\nwrote: \"I am so very happy to know you personally, and I thank you for\r\nthe compliment you bestow in asking me to enroll my name among the most\r\ngrand and noble women of our land. I shall enjoy being counted worthy to\r\nplace it in company with dear Miss Anthony. Mr. Cogswell says many men\r\n(some members of the Legislature among them) in talking with him have\r\nexpressed unexpected satisfaction in the speeches of the convention just\r\nholden--especially in yours, and he says, 'She is a host in herself, I\r\nlike her practical common sense.'\"\r\n\r\nThere was comfort in a letter received at this time from Elizabeth\r\nBoynton Harbert, president of the Illinois Suffrage Association and one\r\nof the Inter-Ocean staff:\r\n\r\n     Before entering upon our usual business talk, I want to wish you\r\n     all beautiful and peaceful things this summer morning, and tell you\r\n     of a rare and genuine tribute to yourself which brought tears of\r\n     gladness to my own eyes when I heard it. In talking to some of the\r\n     old workers, I referred to your life-long sacrifice and wondered\r\n     how we could develop a similar spirit in our younger women, when\r\n     Mrs. Zerelda Wallace said with great impressiveness: \"My dear\r\n     sisters, I want to say this, and to say it with a profound\r\n     realization of all that it means, that to me, the person who, next\r\n     to Jesus Christ himself, has shown to the world a life of perfect\r\n     unselfishness, is Susan B. Anthony.\" I tell you this, my dear\r\n     friend, because I believe such a tribute from such a woman will\r\n     lighten some of the burdens.\r\n\r\nMany similar letters were now received every year, and were as sweet and\r\nfragrant flowers in a pathway which had contained more thorns than\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nIn the hot summer of 1881 Miss Anthony went again to Albany to spend the\r\nlast weeks with another friend, Phebe Hoag Jones, who passed away July\r\n27. She was the intimate associate of Lydia Mott and the last of that\r\nlittle band of Abolitionists so conspicuous in the Democratic stronghold\r\nof Albany for many years preceding the war. At her death Miss Anthony\r\nfelt that she had no longer an abiding place in the State capital, and\r\nexpressed this feeling in a letter to Mrs. Spofford, who replied: \"You\r\nspeak of no longer having a home in Albany. Why, the best homes in that\r\ncity should be gladly opened to you, and some day those people will wake\r\nup and wonder why they did not take you in their arms and hearts and\r\nhelp you in your work.\"[5]\r\n\r\nAll the letters during this summer are filled with sorrow over the\r\nassassination, long suffering and death of President Garfield. After all\r\nwas ended Miss Anthony wrote to a friend:\r\n\r\n     In the reported death-bed utterances of our President, the only one\r\n     which has grated on my ears was that in answer to the query whether\r\n     he had made a will: \"No, and he did not wish one, as he could trust\r\n     the courts to do justice to his wife and children.\" How little even\r\n     the best of men see and feel the dire humiliation and suffering to\r\n     the wife, the widow, who is left to the justice of the courts! My\r\n     heart aches because of man's insensibility to the cruelty of thus\r\n     leaving woman. How can we teach them the lesson that the wife\r\n     suffers all the torment under the law's assuming her rights to her\r\n     property and her children, which the husband would, should it\r\n     assume similar ownership and control over him, his property and\r\n     children after his wife's death.\r\n\r\n     What a twelve weeks these have been, and what a funeral pall has\r\n     rested upon us the past week. Every nook and corner, every\r\n     mountaintop and valley is shrouded in sorrow for this crime against\r\n     the nation. Today the ministers are preaching their sermons on the\r\n     life and character of Garfield. Our Unitarian, Mr. Mann, made his\r\n     special point on the fact that all the people of every sect had\r\n     united in endorsement of Garfield's religion, which was most\r\n     emphatically one of life and action, natural, without cant or\r\n     observance of the outward rites and ceremonies. There is no report\r\n     of even a minister's being asked to pray with him. When the bells\r\n     told of the people's day of special prayer for his life, he\r\n     exclaimed, \"God bless the people,\" but covered his face, as much as\r\n     to say, \"Nothing but science can determine this case.\"\r\n\r\nIn the late summer and fall Mrs. Stanton had a tedious and alarming\r\nattack of malarial fever, and Miss Anthony was greatly distressed\r\nbecause some of her family insisted that it was produced by the long,\r\nhard strain of the work on the History. She writes: \"It is so easy to\r\ncharge every ill to her labors for suffrage, while she knows and I know\r\nthat it is her work for woman which has kept her young and fresh and\r\nhappy all these years. Mrs. Stanton has written me that during her\r\nillness 'she suffered more from her fear that she never should finish\r\nthe History than from the thought of parting with all her friends.'\"\r\n\r\nThe National Prohibition Alliance, which met in New York, October 18,\r\ninvited her to take an official part in its proceedings. She declined to\r\ndo so but attended the meeting and, after a visit to Mrs. Stanton, went\r\nto Washington to the national convention of the W. C. T. U. She had\r\nthree reasons for this: 1st, she understood there was to be an attempt\r\nto supersede Miss Willard, to whom she had become very much attached;\r\n2d, an effort was to be made to commit the association to woman\r\nsuffrage; and 3d, she had made up her mind to see President Arthur on\r\nbusiness connected with her own organization. She sat in the convention\r\nthrough all the three days' sessions and, on motion of Mrs. J. Ellen\r\nFoster, was invited to address it and was introduced by Miss Willard in\r\nwords of strong approval. A prominent woman who was opposed to Miss\r\nWillard's re-election went among the delegates, assuring them in the\r\nmost solemn manner that Miss Willard had insulted every one of them by\r\nintroducing Miss Anthony on the platform, as she did not recognize God.\r\n\"Well,\" replied one of them, an Indianapolis woman, \"I don't know about\r\nthat, but I do know that God has recognized her and her work for the\r\nlast thirty years.\"\r\n\r\nShe had the pleasure of seeing Miss Willard triumphantly re-elected, an\r\nequal suffrage resolution adopted and a department of franchise\r\nestablished. \"So the Christian craft of that great organization has set\r\nsail on the wide sea of woman's enfranchisement,\" she comments. At the\r\nclose of the convention this amusing card was sent to the press: \"All\r\npresidents of State delegations represented in the National W. C. T. U.\r\ndesire to explain, in refutation of a statement in the Post of October\r\n31, that, so far from 'capturing the convention,' Miss Susan B. Anthony\r\nmade no effort to influence their delegations in public or in private,\r\nand is not, nor ever has been, a member of the W. C. T. U., either\r\nlocal, State or national, hence has had no part in its deliberations.\"\r\n\r\nThe President, who was an old schoolmate of her brother Daniel R.,\r\ngranted her a pleasant interview, arranged by Senator Jones, of Nevada,\r\nin which she urged him to recommend in his message to Congress a\r\nstanding committee on the rights of women and also a Sixteenth Amendment\r\nwhich should enfranchise them. The reporters learned of this interview\r\nand, as a result, newspapers throughout the country used a portion of\r\ntheir valuable space in describing \"how President Arthur squeezed Susan\r\nB. Anthony's hand!\"\r\n\r\nOn the way home she stopped in Philadelphia and, with Rachel Foster and\r\nAdeline Thomson, called on George W. Childs, who gave to her $50 for\r\n\"the cause,\" and to each of them one of his rare china cups and saucers.\r\nOn November 7 work on the History was again resumed. The 29th was\r\nWendell Phillips' seventieth birthday and Miss Anthony wrote him a\r\nletter of congratulation, telling him that she always had found comfort\r\nin the thought that, when there were differences between them, she had\r\nhad his respect if not his approval. He replied with the following\r\naffectionate note: \"Hearty thanks for your congratulations. The band\r\ngrows smaller month by month. We ought to stand closer together. You and\r\nI have differed as all earnest souls must. I trust each always believed\r\nthe other to be true in spirit. I know I always did, touching yourself.\r\nYou are good to assure me you have had the same faith in me, and I hope\r\nwhen you reach threescore and ten, some kind friend will cheer you with\r\nequally generous and welcome words.\"\r\n\r\nThe last entry in the diary for 1881 says: \"The year closes down on a\r\nwilderness of work, a swamp of letters and papers almost hopeless.\" She\r\nattacked it, however, with that sublime courage which was ever her\r\nstrongest characteristic, and at the end of the first week of the new\r\nyear the heaviest part of the burden was lifted from her shoulders by\r\nthe receipt of this letter from Mr. Phillips:\r\n\r\n     DEAR SUSAN: Our friend Mrs. Eliza Eddy, Francis Jackson's daughter,\r\n     died a week ago Thursday. At her request, I made her will some\r\n     weeks before. Her man of business, devoted to her for twenty-five\r\n     years, Mr. C. R. Ransom (ex-president of one of our banks) is the\r\n     executor. He and I were present and consulted, and we know all her\r\n     intentions and wishes from long talks with her in years gone by.\r\n     After making various bequests, she ordered the remainder divided\r\n     equally between you and Lucy Stone. There is no question whatever\r\n     that your portion will be $25,000 or $28,000. I advised her, in\r\n     order to avoid all lawyers, to give this sum to you outright, with\r\n     no responsibility to any one or any court, only \"requesting you to\r\n     use it for the advancement of the woman's cause.\"\r\n\r\nAfter all the years of toil without financial recompense, of struggling\r\nto accomplish her work with wholly insufficient means, of depending from\r\nmonth to month on the few dollars which could be gathered in, Miss\r\nAnthony's joy and gratitude scarcely could find expression in words. She\r\nanswered at once:\r\n\r\n     Your most surprising letter reached me last evening. How worthy the\r\n     daughter of Francis Jackson! How it carries me back to his generous\r\n     gift of $5,000; to that noble, fatherly man and that quiet, lovely\r\n     daughter in his home. Never going to Boston during the past fifteen\r\n     years, I had lost sight of her, though I had not forgotten her by\r\n     any means. How little thought have I had all these years that she\r\n     cherished this marvellous trust in me, and now I recognize in her\r\n     munificent legacy your own faith in me, for such was her confidence\r\n     in you that I feel sure she would not have thus willed, if you had\r\n     not fully endorsed her wish. So to you, my dear friend, as to her,\r\n     my unspeakable gratitude goes out. May I prove worthy the care and\r\n     disposal of whatever shall come into my hands. Will you, as my\r\n     friend and Mrs. Eddy's, ever feel free to suggest and advise me as\r\n     to a wise use thereof? I am very glad it was your privilege to be\r\n     with her through these years of her loneliness. I am pleased that\r\n     you and Mr. Ransom propose to appropriate something to her faithful\r\n     brother James, and most cheerfully do I put my name to the paper\r\n     you enclose, with the fullest confidence that you would ask of me\r\n     nothing but right and justice to all parties.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards she received another letter from Mr. Phillips:\r\n\r\n     You remember Mrs. Bacon (Mrs. Eddy's daughter) died about a week\r\n     after she did. Her husband (who Mrs. Eddy knew would disturb her\r\n     will if he could) is trying ostensibly to break it, really to force\r\n     you and Lucy Stone to buy him off. The grounds on which he objects\r\n     to the will are \"that she was of unsound mind; that I and her\r\n     executor exercised over her an undue influence in urging her to\r\n     leave her money as she did; and that she did not know how much she\r\n     was willing away.\" The truth is, we never said one word to her. It\r\n     was her own plan entirely to leave it to woman's rights. Mr. Bacon\r\n     knows there is not a ghost of a chance of his succeeding. The\r\n     executor and I have retained Benjamin F. Butler and mean to fight\r\n     to have Mrs. Eddy's will executed as she wished. The Misses Eddy\r\n     sustain the will and wish it carried out to the letter, and say if\r\n     it is broken they shall give their portion to the woman's rights\r\n     cause, to you and Lucy. I'll tell you when any news is to be had.\r\n     We are doing our best to protect your interests.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of litigation which continued for three years,\r\nand was a source of annoyance to Miss Anthony in other respects besides\r\nbeing deprived of the money. The fact of the bequest naturally being\r\nheralded far and wide by the newspapers, appeals and demands for a share\r\nof it poured in from all quarters, and she had much difficulty in\r\npersuading people that she had not the money already in her hands to be\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nIn company with Mrs. Stanton, Miss Anthony arrived in Washington January\r\n16, 1882, to attend the Fourteenth Annual Convention. The effort to\r\nsecure a special committee on woman suffrage which had failed in the\r\nForty-sixth Congress was successful in the Forty-seventh, through the\r\nchampionship of Senators Hoar and John A. Logan, Representatives John D.\r\nWhite, of Kentucky, Thomas B. Reed and others. There was bitter\r\nopposition by Senator Vest, of Missouri, who declared it to be \"a step\r\ntoward the recognition of woman suffrage, which has nothing in it but\r\nmischief to the institutions and to the society of the whole country.\"\r\nIn his zeal he dropped into poetry, saying,\r\n\r\n    \"A woman's noblest station is retreat,\r\n    Her fairest virtues fly from public sight,\"\r\n\r\nand so, of course, she had no need of a special committee. It was\r\nvigorously opposed also by Senator Beck, of Kentucky, who said \"the\r\ncolored women's votes could be bought for fifty cents apiece;\" and by\r\nSenator Morgan, of Alabama, who made a stump speech on \"dissevered\r\nhomes, disbanded families, pot-house politicians seated at the fireside\r\nwith another man's wife, women fighting their way to the polls through\r\ncrowds of negroes and ruffians,\" etc.[6] It was carried in the Senate by\r\na vote of 35 to 23; in the House, a month later, by a vote of 115 to 84.\r\nMiss Anthony says of this in her diary: \"If the best of worldly good had\r\ncome to me personally, I could not feel more joyous and blest.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual distinguished array of speakers were Rev.\r\nFrederick Hinckley, Representative G. S. Orth, of Indiana, Senator\r\nSaunders, of Nebraska, Clara B. Colby, Harriette R. Shattuck and Helen\r\nM. Gougar, all new on the National platform. The Senate committee on\r\nwoman suffrage just appointed, granted a hearing January 20, and at its\r\nclose expressed a desire to hear other speakers among the ladies on the\r\nfollowing day. Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton presented each of the\r\nmembers of the committee with the first volume of the History of Woman\r\nSuffrage.\r\n\r\nThe convention closed with the usual handsome reception at the Riggs\r\nHouse and immediately afterwards most of the speakers went to\r\nPhiladelphia, where Rachel Foster had arranged for another\r\nconvention.[7] This was held at St. George's Hall, January 23, 24, 25,\r\nwelcomed by Rev. Charles G. Ames, and was highly successful. A pleasant\r\nfeature of this occasion was a luncheon given by that revered Quaker and\r\ntemperance worker, Mrs. Hannah Whitall Smith, of Germantown, to twelve\r\nof the prominent speakers.\r\n\r\nThe two historians hastened back to their work, which was interrupted\r\nonly by Miss Anthony's going to the New York State Suffrage Convention\r\nheld in Chickering Hall, February 1. Calls for her presence and help\r\ncame from many parts of the country. \"O, how I long to be in the midst\r\nof the fray,\" she writes, \"and here I am bound hand and foot. I shall\r\nfeel like an uncaged lion when this book is off my hands.\" On February\r\n15, her birthday was celebrated by suffrage clubs in many places,[8] but\r\nshe refused to be drawn out of her retreat, where she was remembered\r\nwith telegrams, newspaper notices and gifts. In quoting a complimentary\r\nreference from the Rochester Herald, the Elmira Free Press commented:\r\n\r\n     The Herald says too little. Miss Anthony has labored for the most\r\n     part without money, and from pure love of the principle to which\r\n     she has devoted her life. She is as good a knight as has enlisted\r\n     in any crusade, and has sacrificed as much and been as faithful and\r\n     true. She has been thrice true, indeed, because of the ridicule\r\n     showered on her as a woman trying to do a man's work. No man ever\r\n     had the courage of his convictions as much as she. It takes a bold\r\n     spirit to stand up against the dangers of gunpowder in the\r\n     old-time, legitimate way; but it is a braver one that withstands\r\n     ridicule and that mean cunning which makes wit of every act looking\r\n     toward the advancement of women. The Free Press has perhaps had as\r\n     many of the frowns of this \"good gray poet\" of the woman's cause as\r\n     anybody. It has seen enough of them to know, however, that behind\r\n     that somewhat frigid exterior is a sensitiveness which would well\r\n     become a girl of sixteen rather than a lady of sixty-two and which\r\n     shows that the woman is always the woman; and it wants to present\r\n     its compliments to the bravest and grandest old lady within the\r\n     circle of its acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Republic furnished another example of the pleasant things\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony, whom we know well and of whom we can speak from\r\n     personal experience, is so broad in her charity, so cosmopolitan in\r\n     her sympathies, that she will stand, without fearing speck or soil,\r\n     beside any publican or sinner whose eyes have been opened to see\r\n     the good in woman's rights, and who is willing to help on the work\r\n     in his own way. For herself she never deviates from the principles\r\n     she espoused when, stepping upon the rostrum to plead for\r\n     disfranchised women, she determined that her life work should be\r\n     endeavoring to procure for her sex all the rights and privileges of\r\n     which exclusively male legislation had for ages defrauded them.\r\n     With eyes steadily fixed upon the goal she has in view, neither the\r\n     jeers nor ridicule of the crowds without, nor the jealous asides of\r\n     those claiming to be workers in the same cause, have had power to\r\n     distract her attention or make her turn from her labor to answer or\r\n     rebuke.\r\n\r\nThe last of April the second volume of the History was completed and its\r\neditors found to their dismay that they still had enough material on\r\nhand for a third huge volume. Mrs. Stanton sailed for Europe with her\r\ndaughter Harriot, and after Miss Anthony had read the last bit of proof\r\nand seen all safe at the publishers, she obeyed an urgent call from the\r\nwomen at Washington and hastened thither to look after the congressional\r\ncommittees on woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nShe was fortunate in her friends at court at this time, having two\r\ncousins, Elbridge G. Lapham and Henry B. Anthony, in the United States\r\nSenate, and her lawyer, John Van Voorhis, of Rochester, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, all in favor of woman suffrage, and the two cousins on\r\nthe \"select committee\" of the Senate. On June 5, 1882, this committee\r\nmade a report in favor of a Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, signed by the Republican senators, E. G. Lapham, T.\r\nW. Ferry, H. W. Blair and H. B. Anthony. The minority report took the\r\nground that suffrage was a matter which should be regulated solely by\r\nthe States, not by Congress, and was signed by J. Z. George and Howell\r\nE. Jackson (Dems.), and James G. Fair (Rep.).\r\n\r\nThe following year, March 1, 1883, the House committee, John D. White,\r\nchairman, presented a favorable report. This was the first time woman\r\nsuffrage had received a majority report from a Senate or House\r\ncommittee.[9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Very sincerely, John D. White\"]\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Anthony returned home she found this bright note from Harriot\r\nStanton, dated Paris: \"... Dear Susan, you often seem to me like a\r\nsuperb warhorse. You are completely swallowed up in an idea, and it's a\r\nglorious thing to be. Carlyle says, 'The end of man is an Action, not a\r\nThought,' and what a realization of that truth has your life been. You\r\nhave never stopped for idle culture or happy recreations. You are\r\npossessed by a moral force, and you act. You are a Deed, not a\r\nThinking.... I should love to be your biographer. You are to other women\r\nof your time just what Greek architecture is to Gothic. I long to carve\r\nyour literary image, and know I could.\"\r\n\r\nIf Miss Anthony had any hope of rest it was soon dispelled. The\r\nlegislature of Nebraska had submitted a woman suffrage amendment, and\r\nthe women of that State called upon the National Association for\r\nassistance. After a vast amount of preliminary correspondence she left\r\nRochester September 2, and travelled westward, leaving a trail of\r\nnewspaper interviews in her wake, as she was intercepted by reporters at\r\nevery city. En route she wrote to her friend Mrs. Nichols: \"Only think,\r\nI shall not have a white-haired woman on the platform with me, and shall\r\nbe alone there of all the pioneer workers. Always with the 'old guard' I\r\nhad perfect confidence that the wise and right thing would be said. What\r\na platform ours then was of self-reliant, strong women! I felt sure of\r\nyou all, and since you earliest ones have not been with us, Mrs.\r\nStanton's presence has ever made me feel that we should get the true and\r\nbrave word spoken. Now that she is not to be there, I can not quite feel\r\ncertain that our younger sisters will be equal to the emergency, yet\r\nthey are each and all valiant, earnest and talented, and will soon be\r\nleft to manage the ship without even me.\"\r\n\r\nThe opening convention was held in Boyd's Opera House, Omaha, September\r\n26, 27, 28. The Bee was ironical and contemptuous in its treatment,\r\nheading its report \"Mad Anthony's Raid.\" The Herald, under control of a\r\nyoung son of U. S. Senator Hitchcock, was vulgar and abusive, referring\r\nto the question as a \"dead issue.\" The Republican, edited by D. C.\r\nBrooks, replied:\r\n\r\n     PRETTY LIVELY \"DEAD ISSUE.\"--During the three days' sessions of the\r\n     woman suffrage convention, we estimate that 7,000 people were in\r\n     attendance. The Republican, in its three daily issues, and its\r\n     coming weekly issue, will have laid the proceedings in full before\r\n     about 75,000 readers, and the Bee and Herald will have given them\r\n     nearly as many more. For a \"dead issue\" we submit this is a pretty\r\n     respectable showing. Considered as a series of political meetings,\r\n     the suffrage convention had more hearers than all the Democratic\r\n     meetings and conventions held in Omaha during the last five years.\r\n     The audiences were truly representative, embracing the business,\r\n     professional and working interests of our city, and composed very\r\n     largely of voters and citizens influential in politics.\r\n\r\nThe next convention was held in Lincoln with the same crowded houses.\r\nThe newspapers were fair in their reports. The National Association\r\nraised $5,000 by contributions, mostly from outside the State. Miss\r\nAnthony gave her time and services and over $1,000 in money besides all\r\nshe collected. Mrs. Foster and daughters contributed $500. Eleven\r\nspeakers were kept in the field,[10] and all the complicated series of\r\nmeetings was arranged and managed by Rachel Foster, assisted by Mrs.\r\nColby. Miss Anthony herself spoke in forty counties, free transportation\r\nbeing given her by all the railroads in the State. On October 13, she\r\nheld the famous debate at Omaha with Edward Rosewater, editor of the\r\nBee, in the presence of an immense audience. Everywhere her meetings\r\nwere perfect ovations, people coming in from a radius of twenty-five\r\nmiles; and outside of Lincoln and Omaha, there was no audience-room\r\nlarge enough to hold the crowds.\r\n\r\nA splendid force of Nebraska women conducted the campaign in behalf of\r\nthe State. Every effort possible was made in the brief space of six\r\nweeks, but the masses of voters were not prepared for the question, most\r\nof the leading newspapers opposed it, and the women had no help from\r\neither of the political parties. In spite of these fatal drawbacks, the\r\nsuffrage amendment received about one-third of the total vote.[11]\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony returned home by way of St. Louis, where Mrs. Minor gave a\r\nlarge reception in her honor. When she reached Rochester she was invited\r\nby the Lincoln Club, one of the leading political organizations of the\r\ncity, to give her address, \"Woman Wants Bread, not the Ballot.\" The\r\nDemocrat and Chronicle said in its report: \"The large audience-room of\r\nthe city hall was completely filled, and many extra seats were brought\r\nin. A number of prominent ladies and gentlemen occupied seats upon the\r\nplatform. W. E. Werner, president of the club, in introducing the\r\nspeaker, said it was fitting the hall should be full to overflowing with\r\nan audience anxious to hear the greatest advocate of one of the greatest\r\nquestions of the day.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony had made a short trip to Washington immediately upon her\r\nreturn from Nebraska, to confer with the select committees on woman\r\nsuffrage and also to make final arrangements for the approaching\r\nNational Convention. It met in Lincoln Hall, January 23, 24 and 25,\r\n1883, and she presided over its deliberations.\r\n\r\nIn response to many urgent letters written by Mrs. Stanton from England,\r\nand encouraged by friends at home who felt that she needed a long rest\r\nafter more than thirty years of uninterrupted public work, Miss Anthony\r\ndecided to make a trip abroad. As Rachel Foster contemplated a few\r\nyears' study in Europe, the pleasant arrangement was made that she\r\nshould undertake the financial management of the journey, act as\r\ninterpreter and give Miss Anthony the care and attention her loving\r\nheart would suggest.[12] Miss Anthony's sixty-third birthday being near\r\nat hand, the friends in Philadelphia, led by the Citizens' Suffrage\r\nAssociation, Edward M. Davis, president, tendered her a reception, which\r\ncircumstances rendered it necessary to hold on the 19th instead of the\r\n15th of February. The Philadelphia Times gave this account:\r\n\r\n     The parlor of the Unitarian church was filled to overflowing on the\r\n     occasion of the farewell reception to Miss Susan B. Anthony. After\r\n     prayer by Rev. Charles G. Ames, Robert Purvis, who presided, said\r\n     in a brief and earnest address: \"I have the honor, on behalf of the\r\n     National Suffrage Association, to present to you these resolutions\r\n     testifying to their high regard, confidence, and affection.\" After\r\n     the applause which the resolutions evoked, Mr. Purvis continued: \"I\r\n     present these with feelings which I can not express in words, for\r\n     my thoughts take me back in vivid recollection to those stormy\r\n     periods of persecution and outrage when you, Miss Anthony, with the\r\n     foremost in the ranks of the Abolitionists, battled for the freedom\r\n     and rights of the enslaved race. You have lived, with many\r\n     compeers, to see the glorious result of your labors in redeeming\r\n     from the infamy and degradation of chattelism 4,000,000 slaves.\r\n     That done, your attention was turned to the greater question--in\r\n     view of numbers--of woman's emancipation from civil and political\r\n     debasement.\"\r\n\r\n     Upon rising to reply Miss Anthony received an ovation. She said: \"I\r\n     feel that I must speak, because if I should hear all these words of\r\n     praise and remain silent, I should seem to assent to tributes which\r\n     I do not wholly deserve. My kind friends have spoken almost as if I\r\n     had done the work, or the greater part of it, alone, whereas I have\r\n     been only one of many men and women who have labored side by side\r\n     in this cause. Philadelphia has had the honor of giving to the\r\n     world a woman who led the way in this noble effort. Lucretia Mott\r\n     and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were active in the good work ere my\r\n     attention had been called to it. It was through their influence\r\n     that I was led to consider and accept the then new doctrine. Alone\r\n     I should have been as a mere straw in the wind.... I have known\r\n     nothing the last thirty years save the struggle for human rights on\r\n     this continent. If it had been a class of men who were\r\n     disfranchised and denied their legal rights, I believe I should\r\n     have devoted my life precisely as I have done in behalf of my own\r\n     sex. I hope while abroad that I shall do something to recommend our\r\n     work here, so as to make them respect American women and their\r\n     demand for political equality....\"\r\n\r\nLetters, telegrams, flowers and gifts were received in great\r\nnumbers.[13]\r\n\r\nMay Wright Sewall had this graphic description in the Indianapolis\r\nTimes, owned and edited by Col. Wm. R. Holloway, an earnest advocate of\r\nwoman suffrage:\r\n\r\n     The few days spent in Philadelphia by Miss Anthony prior to sailing\r\n     were a series of fêtes. She spoke to over one thousand girls of the\r\n     Normal School on the public duties of women; was officially invited\r\n     to visit the Woman's Medical College; was given a reception by the\r\n     New Century Club; was tendered a complimentary dinner by Mrs. Emma\r\n     J. Bartol, in her own elegant home, where ten courses were served\r\n     and toasts were drunk to the guest of honor.... Letters of\r\n     introduction, quite unsolicited, poured in from friends and\r\n     countrymen personally unknown to her, who thus showed their desire\r\n     to facilitate her meeting with the stars of various desirable\r\n     circles abroad. At the public reception, Robert Purvis presented\r\n     the following testimonial, beautifully engrossed on vellum, and\r\n     encased in garnet velvet with gold borders:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the National Woman Suffrage Association of the\r\n     United States does hereby testify its appreciation of the life-long\r\n     devotion of Susan B. Anthony to the cause of woman; that it\r\n     acknowledges her as the chief inspirer of women in their struggle\r\n     for personal liberty, for civil equity, and for political equality;\r\n     that as one of the foremost of American women it commends her to\r\n     the women of foreign lands.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the members of the association rejoice in the\r\n     approaching holiday of their beloved leader; that they will follow\r\n     her wanderings with affection and sympathy; that during her absence\r\n     they will steadfastly uphold the principles to which her life has\r\n     been devoted; that on her return they will welcome her to a\r\n     resumption of her labors and hold themselves ready to work under\r\n     her able and devoted leadership.\"\r\n\r\n     Among the numerous letters and telegrams were messages from Wendell\r\n     Phillips, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Frederick Douglass, Mary Clemmer,\r\n     Helen Potter, Emma C. Bascom and Dr. Alida C. Avery.... Probably no\r\n     testimony was more enjoyed than the following:\r\n\r\n     \"ROCHESTER, N. Y., THE HOME OF SUSAN B. ANTHONY: In this open\r\n     letter old friends and neighbors unite with all who honor the\r\n     birthday of its true citizen, and express the sincere wish that\r\n     Miss Anthony in her sojourn in strange lands may find what she has\r\n     in full measure here at home--a genuine appreciation of her true\r\n     womanliness, her sturdy adherence to honest conviction and her\r\n     heroic stand, against all opposition, for the higher education and\r\n     enfranchisement of women. Wishing her Godspeed and a safe return,\r\n     we, the undersigned, do not need to assure her that neither the\r\n     triumphs nor the defeats of her future public life will change our\r\n     estimation of her, for to us she will ever remain what her life\r\n     among us has proved her to be--a good, true woman, self-consecrated\r\n     to the cause of woman in every land.\"\r\n\r\n     The signatures include the names of eighty of the leading men and\r\n     women of Rochester; among them editors of the papers of both\r\n     parties, pastors of the prominent churches, university professors,\r\n     bankers, politicians, etc. Honor, if tardy, surely comes at last to\r\n     the prophet in her own country. A song written for the occasion and\r\n     inscribed to Miss Anthony, by Annie E. McDowell, one of the first\r\n     editors of a woman's paper, was splendidly sung by Mr. Ford, the\r\n     composer, who had set it to music.\r\n\r\nAmong the telegrams was this from her brother, D. R. Anthony:\r\n\"Sixty-three years have crowned you with the honor and respect of the\r\npeople of America, and with the love of your brothers and sisters.\"\r\nFrom the friends in Washington, D. C., came a plush case, on whose satin\r\nlining rested an exquisite point lace fichu and sleeve ruffles. A New\r\nYork gentleman sent $100 to be used toward the purchase of an India\r\nshawl, writing: \"I don't believe in woman suffrage, but I do believe in\r\nSusan B. Anthony.\" The Cheney Brothers sent a handsome black silk dress\r\npattern; Helen Potter, a steamer rug; the Fosters, a travelling bag;\r\nAdeline and Annie Thomson, a silver cup; Robert Purvis, a gold-handled\r\numbrella, and there were various other tokens of remembrance. Many of\r\nthe leading papers contained an editorial farewell, with a hearty\r\ncompliment and Godspeed. The Chicago Tribune, edited by Joseph Medill,\r\noffered this tribute:\r\n\r\n     The best known and most popular woman in the United States, engaged\r\n     in public work, is Susan B. Anthony, the co-worker of Wm. Lloyd\r\n     Garrison, Lydia Maria Child, Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Mott and\r\n     others in the anti-slavery movement, and the fellow-laborer of\r\n     Elizabeth Cady Stanton in the woman's rights movement. She ranks\r\n     first among the warriors in this latter contest, because she has\r\n     lived her life in its service and there has been no side issue to\r\n     it. Neither father nor mother, husband nor children, have diverted\r\n     her mind from her hobby, or led her to cease for a day from the\r\n     prosecution of the task she set out to accomplish.... Miss Anthony\r\n     is an American woman whom the better class of English people\r\n     particularly, and of foreigners generally, will delight to honor,\r\n     and one that her country-women are pleased to have represent them.\r\n     She is, in point of character and ability, one of the few of her\r\n     sex who have made themselves a name and a place in the history of\r\n     her time....\r\n\r\n     She has had occasion to speak sharply, to lecture women severely,\r\n     when in her heart she would have preferred to praise; but women\r\n     love her dearly all the same, and trust her implicitly. In\r\n     integrity, stainless honor and generosity of sentiment and of deed\r\n     she has no peer. She has stood the storm of raillery and abuse she\r\n     aroused, as the leader of the \"shrieking sisterhood,\" with perfect\r\n     equanimity, and while others were cowed by the ridicule which was\r\n     hardest of all to bear, Miss Anthony busied herself using this\r\n     opportunity to show to women the real opinion of them entertained\r\n     by the stronger sex.\r\n\r\n     Only those who are aware of the great and beneficent changes made\r\n     in the laws relating to the rights of property, for instance, can\r\n     at all estimate the good accomplished by these brave women. Almost\r\n     all the leaders in the movement are gone. Mrs. Stanton and Miss\r\n     Anthony, both elderly women, now remain in the work, and Miss\r\n     Anthony alone still labors with the old-time zeal and freedom. She\r\n     is at her best mentally and physically, and is likely to live many\r\n     years to follow up the work she is now doing. The best lesson that\r\n     women can learn from her life is that success in any one thing is\r\n     secured only by the sacrifice of many others, and that for a woman\r\n     to reach the highest place in her chosen pursuit is for her to work\r\n     with an eye single to it, counting it a privilege to forego\r\n     pleasures and affections which tend to distract and divide\r\n     attention. Miss Anthony knew this secret of success, as she has\r\n     proven.\r\n\r\n     When the history of the reform work done in this country in this\r\n     century is written, no individual laborer will have higher praise\r\n     than that which belongs to Miss Anthony. Honest, sincere, tolerant\r\n     and kind, she has won the homage of her adversaries; for while\r\n     there is but a small minority of men and women who believe in woman\r\n     suffrage, there are none who fail to pay tribute to the sterling\r\n     qualities of this representative woman.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas City Journal said good-by in these graceful words: \"Susan B.\r\nAnthony will celebrate her sixty-third birthday tomorrow, and in a few\r\ndays will sail for England.... She goes abroad a republican\r\nqueen--uncrowned to be sure, but none the less of the blood royal, and\r\nwe have faith that the noblest men and women of Europe will at once\r\nrecognize and welcome her as their equal. Fair winds waft her over the\r\nsea and home again!\"\r\n\r\nThe two ladies sailed from Philadelphia on the morning of February 23,\r\nand a special dispatch to the New York Times thus announced their\r\ndeparture:\r\n\r\n     Miss Susan B. Anthony, accompanied by Miss Rachel Foster, embarked\r\n     on the British Prince, of the American Steamship Line, at 9 o'clock\r\n     this morning, for Liverpool. Notwithstanding the cold and cheerless\r\n     weather, quite a number of persons stood patiently on the wharf,\r\n     facing the raw and snow-laden air which blew from the river,\r\n     waiting to see the steamer get under way and to catch a glimpse of\r\n     the celebrated champion of woman's rights. A little before 10\r\n     o'clock Miss Anthony came out of her stateroom with several friends\r\n     and, bidding them a final farewell, watched with sober countenance\r\n     as they passed down the gang-plank. Among those present were Miss\r\n     Mary Anthony, of Rochester, Miss Julia Foster, Miss Thomson, a\r\n     sister of the first president of the Pennsylvania R. R.; Rev. Dr.\r\n     Soule, formerly of Scotland; Mrs. M. Louise Thomas and Edward M.\r\n     Davis....\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony was attired in a black silk dress and wore a black\r\n     velvet bonnet. A beaver-lined satin circular was drawn tightly\r\n     about her form. She retired immediately to her stateroom, where a\r\n     pleasant surprise awaited her in the shape of a handsome silk flag,\r\n     the gift of a friend, which was suspended in a corner of the room.\r\n     Her eyes rested upon the tasty and comfortable apartment, bearing\r\n     numerous evidences of the kindly feeling and good wishes of her\r\n     friends, with visible enjoyment and emotion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] This comment applies with equal force to Albany today. It is the\r\nonly city in the United States where Miss Anthony has not a standing\r\ninvitation to a number of hospitable homes.\r\n\r\n[6] For full report of debate see History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. III,\r\np. 198.\r\n\r\n[7] Miss Anthony, Mrs. Sewall and Mrs. Jane Graham Jones remained over\r\none day to appear before the House committee, presenting arguments in\r\nfavor of abolishing the word \"male\" from the Constitution of Dakota\r\nbefore admitting it as a State.\r\n\r\n[8] This national celebration of Miss Anthony's birthday by suffrage\r\nclubs was first suggested by Elizabeth Boynton Harbert, in her\r\ndepartment, \"Woman's Kingdom,\" in the Chicago Inter-Ocean.\r\n\r\n[9] For full text of reports see History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. III.,\r\np. 263.\r\n\r\n[10] Mrs. Sewall, Mrs. Gougar, Miss Couzins, Mrs. Minor, Mrs. Saxon,\r\nMiss Hindman, Mrs. Shattuck, Mrs. Mason, Madame Neymann, Mrs. Blake and\r\nMiss Anthony.\r\n\r\n[11] After the election some of the students of the State University\r\nplaced an effigy of Miss Anthony in a coffin and with torches and\r\npallbearers started in a funeral procession. They were met by another\r\ncrowd of students who, to preserve the honor of the university,\r\noverpowered them and took the effigy away.\r\n\r\n[12] It was on this trip that, as \"Miss Anthony\" seemed too formal and\r\n\"Susan\" too familiar, Miss Foster adopted the endearing title \"Aunt\r\nSusan.\" After they returned and a few of the younger workers most\r\nclosely associated with her began to use this name, Miss Anthony did not\r\nobject; but when it came into general use and not only older women and\r\ncomparative strangers, but men also, and the newspapers, fell into the\r\nhabit of calling her \"Aunt Susan,\" she was very much annoyed and never\r\nheard or saw the name without an inward protest.\r\n\r\n[13] Among the letters was the following from Senator John J. Ingalls:\r\n\"I see by the papers that you are about to depart for Europe. Though I\r\ndo not sympathize with the opinions whose advocacy has made you famous,\r\nyet I am not insensible to the great value of the example of your\r\ncourageous and self-denying labors to the cause of American womanhood. I\r\nhope that none but prosperous gales may follow your ship, that your\r\nvisit may be happy, and that your life may be spared till your\r\naspirations are realized.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nMISS ANTHONY'S EUROPEAN LETTERS.\r\n\r\n1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo pen so well as Miss Anthony's own, can describe her delightful tour\r\nabroad, and although her letters were dashed off while travelling from\r\npoint to point, or at the close of a hard day's sight-seeing, and the\r\nentries in the diary are a mere word, they tell in a unique way her\r\npersonal impressions. Because of limited space descriptions of scenery\r\nwill be omitted in order to leave room for opinions of people and\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n                              ON BOARD THE BRITISH PRINCE, February 24.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MRS. SPOFFORD: Here we are at noon, Friday, steaming down\r\n     Delaware Bay. We got along nicely until 3 P. M. yesterday, when we\r\n     came to a standstill. \"Stuck in the mud,\" was the report. There we\r\n     lay until eight, when with the incoming tide we made a fruitless\r\n     attempt to get over the bar; then had to steam back up the river to\r\n     anchor, and lie there until nine this morning--twenty-four hours\r\n     almost in sight of the loved ones! It is a break from all\r\n     fastenings to friends to be thus cut loose from the wharf and\r\n     wafted out into the waters. These long hours of delay have given me\r\n     time to think of those left behind, and how very far short I have\r\n     come of doing and saying all I should have done and said....\r\n\r\nFrom the diary:\r\n\r\n     Feb. 24.--The weather lovely; saloon cozy and pleasant with piano,\r\n     flowers and canaries. There are only seven passengers, among them a\r\n     Catholic priest, a dear little three-year-old child and a baby. We\r\n     sent twenty letters on shore, written during the day we have been\r\n     detained.\r\n\r\n     Feb. 25.--Today dawns with no possibility of communicating with a\r\n     soul outside the ship, a lonely feeling indeed; but I am determined\r\n     to get all the good I can to mind and body out of this trip, and as\r\n     little harm as possible.\r\n\r\n     Feb. 26.--I sit at the captain's right hand at table. The sea is\r\n     perfectly smooth; I wonder if this broad expanse can be rolled up\r\n     into mountains.\r\n\r\n     4 P.M.--The wind and waves are beginning to roar. The priest shows\r\n     signs of surrender.\r\n\r\n     Mar. 2.--Sea calm and dishes no longer have to be fastened to\r\n     table. It seems like freedom again. I can think of nothing beyond\r\n     shipboard, can see no moves to be made when we reach Liverpool.\r\n\r\n     Mar. 4.--Winds fair, sea smooth, whole company at breakfast.\r\n     Captain Burton read the church service. Rachel played the piano and\r\n     led the singing.\r\n\r\n                              ON BOARD THE BRITISH PRINCE, March 5.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER MARY: At lunch the captain said, \"I'll soon show you\r\n     land! It will be Mizzenhead, the farthest southwest point of\r\n     Ireland.\" This is the first pen put to paper since I wrote you at\r\n     the Delaware breakwater, eleven days ago. Think of it, oh, ye\r\n     scribbling fairies, almost two weeks and not a letter written by S.\r\n     B. A.!\r\n\r\n     Well, we are thus far and have had no more than what the sailors\r\n     call a \"stiff breeze\" and only two whiffs of that sort. Since\r\n     Thursday the weather has been lovely--bright sun and crisp air.\r\n     Rachel succumbed one night when the \"stiff breeze\" first opened\r\n     upon us, and I felt a little squalmy. The next morning a sudden\r\n     lurch of the ship took both feet from under me and I was flat on my\r\n     back. The following day while I was lying on a seat, reading and\r\n     half-dozing, the first I knew I was in a heap on the floor. Then I\r\n     learned it wasn't safe to lie down without a board fence in front.\r\n     Again, in the evening I had taken the one loose chair in the\r\n     saloon, drawn it under a lamp and seated myself very complacently\r\n     to read, when lo, I was pitched over as if propelled from a\r\n     ten-pounder! Three times and out--all in rapid succession--taught\r\n     me to trust not to myself at all, but always to something fast to\r\n     the ship. I haven't lost a meal during the whole trip. Another time\r\n     I should take a larger stock of oranges, lemons and other fruit.\r\n\r\n     3 P. M.--We have just been up on the bridge for a first sight of\r\n     the Emerald Isle. So long as there was no immediate prospect of\r\n     setting foot on land, I could get up no spirit to write or think. I\r\n     have worn the old velvet-trimmed black silk dress right through,\r\n     and it is pretty well salted. I should love to have Lucy and Louise\r\n     and Maud along on this trip, with sister Mary, too. What a jolly\r\n     lot of tramps we would make! Well, their one ray of hope is to\r\n     \"pull through\" the free academy and get on their own feet. There is\r\n     plenty of good in store for all who can bring themselves in line to\r\n     get it. Holding a dish right side up to catch the shower is the\r\n     work for each one of us. How much I do think and hope for the three\r\n     nieces now entering womanhood. For Susie B. Jr., and little Anna O.\r\n     and Gula, I shall think and hope by and by. As for the nephews, I\r\n     do not forget them, but they'll fight their way through somehow, as\r\n     have all boys before them....\r\n\r\n     Dinner is over and an hour's talk at table after it. The Englishman\r\n     Mr. Mullinor, summed up: \"Your country will come to ruin from such\r\n     doctrines as you woman's rights folks advocate;\" and I have put the\r\n     case to him to the best of my sea-brain's ability. This is the very\r\n     first time I have let my tongue loose. We expect to be in Liverpool\r\n     tomorrow early, and then I will write you. Just take it for granted\r\n     all is well with me, and I will try to do the same with you.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony found at Liverpool a cordial letter from Mrs. A. A.\r\nSargent, whose husband was now United States Minister to Germany. She\r\nwelcomed her to Europe, saying: \"You always have the entree to our home\r\nand hearts. Come and stay as long as you will.\" A note from Mrs. Stanton\r\nto her \"beloved Susan\" said: \"I came up to London the moment I heard of\r\nthe arrival of the British Prince. To think of your choosing a 'Prince'\r\nwhen a 'Queen' was coming! I am on the tiptoe of expectation to meet\r\nyou.... I write in the suffrage rooms surrounded with ladies.\"\r\n\r\nA week later the diary records: \"Left London at 10 A. M. for Rome,\r\nRachel and self, also Hattie Daniels, Alice Blatch and Mrs. Fanny\r\nKeartland, five in all, three of the Eagle and two of the Lion, each\r\nglorying in her own nationality!\"\r\n\r\n                              ROME, NO. 75 VIA NAZIONALE, March 22.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: Here it is a whole month tomorrow since we took a\r\n     last glimpse of each other and scarce a decent letter have I\r\n     written you; but it is fearfully hard work to find the minutes.\r\n     There is so much to tell, and the spelling and pronunciation of the\r\n     names are so perfectly awful.... At Liverpool we drove two hours in\r\n     the Princess and Sefton parks and then went to the city museum,\r\n     where the most interesting things to us were the portraits of all\r\n     the Bonapartes--men and women, old and young--Josephine's very\r\n     lovely; and to the city library, which is free. There is also an\r\n     immense free lecture hall, which was built for an aquarium but\r\n     found impracticable, so it is an enormous circle, seated from the\r\n     circumference down to the center, with a large platform at one side\r\n     and every step and seat cut out of solid stone. Here the most\r\n     learned men of the English colleges give free lectures, the city\r\n     fund being ample to meet all expenses. The librarian, on hearing we\r\n     were Americans, took great pains to show us everything. Of course\r\n     when he said, \"We have over 80,000 volumes,\" I asked, \"Have you\r\n     among them the History of Woman Suffrage, by Mesdames Stanton,\r\n     etc., of America?\" And lo, he had never heard of it!\r\n\r\n     Thursday morning we took train--second-class carriage--for London.\r\n     Mrs. Stanton was at the station, her face beaming and her white\r\n     curls as lovely as ever, and we were soon landed at our\r\n     boarding-house. Lydia Becker came to dinner by Mrs. Stanton's\r\n     invitation, so she was the first of England's suffrage women for us\r\n     to meet. Friday afternoon we glanced into the House of Commons and\r\n     happened to see Gladstone presenting some motion. Spent the evening\r\n     chatting with Mrs. Stanton--a world of things to talk over....\r\n\r\n     Saturday we went again to Bayswater to see Mrs. Rose--found her\r\n     very lonely because of the death of her devoted husband a year ago.\r\n     She threw her arms around my neck and her first words were: \"O,\r\n     that my heart would break now and you might close my eyes, dear\r\n     Susan!\" She is vastly more isolated in England because of her\r\n     non-Christian views than she ever was in America. Sectarianism\r\n     sways everything here more now than fifty years ago with us.\r\n\r\n     That afternoon I left for Basingstoke, the new home of darling\r\n     Harriot Stanton, now with Blatch suffixed. Her husband is a fine\r\n     specimen of a young Englishman of thirty. Sunday morning he took me\r\n     in a dog-cart through two gentlemen's parks, a pleasant drive\r\n     through pasture and woodland, thousands of acres enclosed by a\r\n     stone wall. When I said, \"What a shame that all these acres should\r\n     thus lie waste, while myriads of poor people are without an inch of\r\n     ground whereon to set foot,\" he replied: \"They would be no better\r\n     off if all should be cut up into forty-acre farms and divided among\r\n     the poor, for no man could possibly support a family upon one. The\r\n     owners of these parks are actually reduced to poverty trying to\r\n     keep them up.\" So you see it is of no use to talk of giving every\r\n     Englishman a farm, when the land is so poor no one can make a\r\n     living off of it. Of course this is not true of all England, but\r\n     evidently its inhabitants must be fed from other countries. On our\r\n     return I was conducted through the garden and green-house of Mr.\r\n     Blatch's father, where I saw peach trees in blossom and grape vines\r\n     budding. The tree-trunks were not larger than my arm and I\r\n     exclaimed, \"How many peaches can you get off these little trees?\"\r\n     \"Why, last year, we had 250,\" said he. How is that by the side of\r\n     our old farm harvest of 1,000 trees? And yet these English people\r\n     talk as if they raised fruit!...\r\n\r\n     The next day I returned to London and Mrs. Stanton and I called on\r\n     Rev. William Henry Channing at the West End, and had a two hours'\r\n     chat with him.... He was very cordial and on our leaving said, \"I\r\n     can't tell you how grateful I am for this interview. You have my\r\n     blessing and benediction;\" so we were glad at heart. Mr. Channing\r\n     loves America above all other countries and feels it was a mistake\r\n     for him to have left it. His elder daughter is the wife of Edwin\r\n     Arnold. March 12 we dined with the son-in-law of William Ashurst,\r\n     the friend of Wm. Lloyd Garrison--Mr. Biggs, and his four\r\n     daughters. Caroline Ashurst Biggs, the second, is the editor of the\r\n     Englishwoman's Review and one of the leading suffrage women of\r\n     England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Very sincerely yours, Caroline A. Biggs.\"]\r\n\r\n     After dinner some twenty ladies and gentlemen came in and we had a\r\n     delightful evening, but such a continual serving of refreshments!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mentia Taylor (Signed: \"Yours very sincerely Mentia\r\nTaylor\")]\r\n\r\n     Tuesday morning I went again to Mrs. Rose's and finding her\r\n     bonneted and cloaked for a chair ride, I walked beside her, holding\r\n     her hand, through Kensington Park. I hope and almost believe she\r\n     will go back to America with me. I feel sure that we, who have not\r\n     forgotten her early and wonderful work for woman and for freedom\r\n     of thought, will do all in our power to smooth her last days....\r\n     That evening Rachel and I went to see Irving and Ellen Terry in\r\n     Much Ado About Nothing. The painting and the lights and shadows of\r\n     the scenery were lovely, and I suppose the acting was good, but I\r\n     can not enjoy love and flirtation exhibited on the stage any more\r\n     than off. All passional demonstrations seem to belong to the two\r\n     concerned, not to other persons. The lovemaking, however, was\r\n     cooler, more distant and more piquant than usual.\r\n\r\n     Wednesday afternoon Mrs. Rebecca Moore, our old Revolution\r\n     correspondent, took me to a meeting at Mrs. Müller's, about the\r\n     Contagious Diseases Acts--fifty or sixty ladies present--was\r\n     introduced, and several invited me to speak for them when I\r\n     returned to London. Miss Rye, who has made between thirty and forty\r\n     trips across the Atlantic with little girls, taking over more than\r\n     10,000 and placing them in good homes in Canada, was there and\r\n     spoke. She said all her efforts could accomplish nothing in\r\n     thinning out the more than 1,000,000 surplus women of the island.\r\n     Not one seemed to dare speak out the whole of the facts and\r\n     philosophy. Each promised, \"I will not shock you by calling the\r\n     names,\" etc. Mrs. Peter Taylor's reception that evening was an\r\n     unusually brilliant affair. She is looked upon as the mother of the\r\n     English movement, as Mrs. Stanton is of the American. She is a\r\n     magnificent woman and acted the part of hostess most gracefully.\r\n     Her husband is a member of Parliament. At eleven we went home and\r\n     packed our trunks to be off for Rome on the morrow, half-regretting\r\n     that we had planned to leave London....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       ROME, March 23.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: It is noon--Good Friday--and just set in for a\r\n     steady rain, so I will give you the goings, seeings and sayings of\r\n     our company since leaving London.... We started from Victoria\r\n     Station--second-class carriage, no sleeper--for a three days' and\r\n     two nights' journey to Rome. It looked appalling, even to so old a\r\n     traveller as myself, but I inwardly said, \"I can stand it if the\r\n     younger ones can.\" The crossing of the straits of Dover was rough,\r\n     the sea dashing over the sides of the boat, but Rachel and I went\r\n     through the two hours without a quaver. At Calais we had the same\r\n     good luck as at London--a compartment of the car all to ourselves.\r\n     Here we were to be settled without change for that night and the\r\n     next day, so with bags and shawl-straps, bundles, lunch-baskets and\r\n     a peck of oranges, we adjusted ourselves. We breakfasted at Basle,\r\n     after having pillowed on each other for the night as best we could.\r\n     Now we were in the midst of the Jura mountains, and all day long we\r\n     wound up and down their snowy sides and around the beautiful lakes\r\n     nestling at their feet--through innumerable tunnels, one of them,\r\n     the St. Gothard, taking twenty-three minutes--over splendid bridges\r\n     and along lovely brooks and rivers.\r\n\r\n     We arrived at Milan at 7:50 P. M., when even the bravest of our\r\n     party voted to stop over twenty-four hours and try the virtues of a\r\n     Christian bed. Rachel and I shared a large old-fashioned room with\r\n     a soap-stone stove, where we had a wood-fire built at once.\r\n     (Remember that all the houses have marble floors and stairs, and\r\n     are plastered on the stone walls, so they seem like perfect\r\n     cellars.) We had two single bedsteads (I haven't seen any other\r\n     sort on the continent) with the same bedclothes covering both. Our\r\n     big room was lighted with just two candles! We \"slept solid\" till 8\r\n     A. M., when Rachel got out her Italian phrase-book, rang the bell\r\n     and ordered a fire and hot water.\r\n\r\n     After fairly good steak and coffee, we five began a day of steady\r\n     sight-seeing.... In the evening we went to the station, and here\r\n     found a wood-fire in a fireplace and monstrous paintings of Christ\r\n     and the saints on the walls. All who had trunks had now to pay for\r\n     every pound's weight. I had brought only my big satchel and\r\n     shawl-strap. We were not so fortunate as to find a compartment to\r\n     ourselves but had two ladies added to our number, while four or\r\n     five men in the next one smoked perpetually and the fumes came over\r\n     into ours. We growled but that availed nothing, as men here have\r\n     the right of way. At Genoa the ladies left us--midnight--and two\r\n     men took their places. These proved to be seafarers and could talk\r\n     English, so we learned quite a bit from them. At ten we were halted\r\n     and rushed in to breakfast. Sunday afternoon we reached the Eternal\r\n     City and came direct to the Pension Chapman, tired and hungry, but\r\n     later went to St. John's Cathedral to vespers.... After dinner we\r\n     were glad to lay ourselves away. We have a pleasant room, with\r\n     windows opening upon a broad court and lovely garden and fountain.\r\n     Monday we drove around the city for bird's-eye views from famous\r\n     points. Such wonders of ruins upon ruins!\r\n\r\n     Sunday Evening.--It is of no avail that I try and try to write-when\r\n     the sight-seeing is done for the day I am too tired.... Last\r\n     evening the Coliseum was illuminated--a weird, wonderful sight.\r\n     Today, Easter Sunday, I have seen crowds of people reverently\r\n     kissing St. Peter's big toe. Tomorrow we go to Naples for a week\r\n     and then return and finish Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  NAPLES, March 27.\r\n\r\n     Here we are, Rachel and I, at the Pension Brittanique, far up a\r\n     high hill, in a room overlooking the beautiful bay of Naples. It is\r\n     lovely, lovely! The little island of Capri, the city, the bold\r\n     shores and mountain setting--a perfect gem.... We have a little bit\r\n     of wood-fire with the smallest sticks--twigs we should call\r\n     them--two sperm candles to light our bedroom and no matches except\r\n     what we furnish. But 8 o'clock is here and we are all to meet for\r\n     breakfast....\r\n\r\n     Yesterday was a lovely _May_ day, and our party drove to the\r\n     village of Resina, which is built forty feet above the ruins of\r\n     Herculaneum. There, with a guide, we descended a hundred steps and\r\n     walked through the old theater, over the same stone stairs and\r\n     seats which two thousand years ago were occupied by the gayest of\r\n     mortals. Then we went to the ruins of Pompeii and ate our lunch\r\n     under large old trees growing upon the debris left by the great\r\n     eruption. We passed through the narrow streets, over stone\r\n     pavements worn by the tread of long-buried feet, through palaces,\r\n     public gardens and baths, temples, the merchants' exchange,\r\n     customhouse and magnificent theater....\r\n\r\n     I have just received John Bright's splendid address before the\r\n     2,000 students of Glasgow University on being made Lord Rector. It\r\n     fired my soul beyond all the ruins and all the arts in Rome or\r\n     Naples. It is grand indeed, and reminds one of our own Wendell\r\n     Phillips' address to the Harvard students two years ago.[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  ROME, March 29.\r\n\r\n     _To Madam Susan B. Anthony, of New York, U. S. A._\r\n\r\n     MADAM: We had the honor to announce your coming to Rome some three\r\n     weeks ago in the Italian Times. While we ourselves have an\r\n     impressive appreciation of your distinguished mental acquirements,\r\n     yet we would wish to carry to our numerous English-speaking\r\n     subscribers on this continent some testimony of your presence in\r\n     our midst. Therefore we place our columns at your disposal, and\r\n     will esteem the privilege of presenting to the public any topic\r\n     your facile pen may write. To this end we will wait upon you or be\r\n     pleased to see you at our sanctum. With much respect, we are,\r\n     Madam, your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n                              THE PROPRIETORS OF THE ITALIAN TIMES.\r\n\r\n     [Only English newspaper published in Italy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       ROME, April 1.\r\n\r\n     DEAR BROTHER D. R.: We have climbed Vesuvius. One feels richly paid\r\n     when the puffing and exploding and ascending of the red-hot lava\r\n     meet the ears and eyes. The mountains, the Bay of Naples, the sail\r\n     to Capri and the Blue Grotto are fully equal to my expectations....\r\n     The squalid-looking people, however, and their hopeless fate make\r\n     one's stay at any of these Italian resorts most depressing. Troops\r\n     of beggars beset one all along the streets and roads, and with\r\n     tradesmen there is no honesty. For instance, a man charged some\r\n     twenty francs for a shell comb, then came down to seven, six, five,\r\n     and finally asked, \"What will you give?\" I, never dreaming he would\r\n     take it, said, \"two francs,\" and he threw the comb into the\r\n     carriage.... Saturday we took the cars from Naples to Palermo.\r\n     Every mountainside having a few seven-by-nine patches of soil in a\r\n     place, is terraced and covered with grape vines and lemon trees,\r\n     the latter now yellow with fruit. On many I counted twenty and\r\n     thirty terraces, each with a solid stone wall to hold the earth in\r\n     place. It is wonderful what an amount of labor it costs to earn\r\n     even the little the natives seem to care for. Our hotel here is an\r\n     old monastery, and on one side of the court is the cathedral with\r\n     its grotesque paintings. One becomes fairly sickened with the\r\n     ghastly spectacle of the dead Christ. It is amazing how little they\r\n     make of the living Christ.\r\n\r\n     On Monday morning we drove back over that magnificent road, and\r\n     took the train to Naples. In the afternoon we went to Lake Avernus\r\n     and into the grotto of the sibyls, the entrance to Dante's Inferno.\r\n     It was a dark, cavernous passage and with the flaring candles\r\n     making the darkness only more visible, we could not but feel there\r\n     was reason for the old superstition. The narrowness of the streets\r\n     of Naples--and they are without the pretense of a sidewalk--leave\r\n     the men, women and children, horses and carriages, funny little\r\n     donkeys with their big loads, the cows and goats (which are each\r\n     night and morning driven along and halted at the doors while the\r\n     pint cupful, more or less, is milked to supply the people within)\r\n     all marching along together in the filthy road, jostling each other\r\n     at every step.\r\n\r\n     But we are back in Rome now and this forenoon we spent in the\r\n     galleries of the Vatican. One is simply dazed with the wealth of\r\n     marble--not only statuary, but stairs, pillars and massive\r\n     buildings. We stop here till the 9th, then go to Florence.[15]\r\n\r\n     It is good for our young civilization to see and study that of the\r\n     old world, and observe the hopelessness of lifting the masses into\r\n     freedom and freedom's industry, honesty and integrity. How any\r\n     American, any lover of our free institutions based on equality of\r\n     rights for all, can settle down and live here is more than I can\r\n     comprehend. It will be only by overturning the powers that\r\n     education and equal chances ever can come to the rank and file. The\r\n     hope of the world is indeed in our republic; so let us work to make\r\n     it a _genuine_ democracy, where every citizen--woman as well as\r\n     man--shall be crowned with the one symbol of equality--the\r\n     ballot....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       ROME, April 5.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: How these anniversary days of our dear mother's\r\n     illness and death bring back to me everything, even at this\r\n     distance and amid these strange surroundings. How she would have\r\n     enjoyed these sights because of her knowledge and love of history.\r\n     She could have told the Bible story of every one of these great\r\n     frescoes. What a woman she would have been, could she have had the\r\n     opportunities of education and culture which her granddaughters are\r\n     having....\r\n\r\n     Tell Mrs. Lewia Smith her lovely piece of lace has been honored\r\n     with the wearing in London and Rome several times and has been\r\n     pronounced beautiful; but I prize it most of all for the giver's\r\n     sake. No one but she would have trudged through the slush and rain\r\n     to get those splendid names to that testimonial. Nothing which came\r\n     to me gave so much pleasure as those signatures of my own townsmen\r\n     and women, from President Anderson all the way to the end of the\r\n     list.... This evening Rachel has gone to a friend's to study German\r\n     so as to make our way with that nationality. What a jumble, that by\r\n     just crossing an imaginary line one finds people who can't\r\n     understand a word one says!\r\n\r\n     Last evening we heard the grand Ristori render a part of Dante's\r\n     Inferno and a selection from Joan of Arc. Of course I couldn't\r\n     understand a word she said, but her voice, her gestures, her\r\n     expression told the whole story. Then the music, vocal and\r\n     instrumental, was the softest and sweetest....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  ZURICH, April 23.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: We spent Friday night at Milan--there took our last\r\n     look at Italian cathedrals, as we did our first, and its own still\r\n     holds highest place as to beauty. We left early next morning and\r\n     very soon were among the Alps.... The eleven hours' stretch was\r\n     tiresome and disgusting inside our compartment, with from three to\r\n     five stalwart men puffing away at their pipes all day long, and at\r\n     every station rushing out for a drink of wine or beer. Our only\r\n     chance of a free breath was to open the window, and then all the\r\n     natives were in consternation!\r\n\r\n     We reached Zurich at six and, after a splendid dinner of roast\r\n     chicken, green peas and lettuce, took a cab and called on Elizabeth\r\n     Sargent, who is studying medicine at the university, and found her\r\n     very happy and glad to see us. In the afternoon we took a\r\n     delightful drive, as it was too cold and misty for the lake\r\n     excursion we had intended. The highest Alps are still lost to us by\r\n     fog and clouds. After supper we called at the American consulate.\r\n     Think of our government supporting a consul in most of the\r\n     twenty-two cantons of Switzerland!\r\n\r\n     Tuesday.--At Munich. We saw princes and princesses galore out\r\n     driving this afternoon, but not the king. We leave tomorrow morning\r\n     for Nuremberg, and reach Berlin Saturday, and there I hope to rest\r\n     at least a week--but then the Emperor William must be seen, and\r\n     lots of other curiosities.... If I could command the money, as soon\r\n     as each of our girls graduated, I would take her first on a tour of\r\n     her own continent and then through the old world, before she\r\n     settled down to the hard work of life either in a profession or in\r\n     marriage. Thus she would have much to think of and live over, no\r\n     matter how heavy might be the burdens and sorrows of her after\r\n     life....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       COLOGNE, May 8.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: We left Berlin yesterday morning after a delightful\r\n     week with the Sargents. I do not believe our nation ever has been\r\n     represented at any foreign court by such genuine republican women,\r\n     in the truest and broadest sense, as are Mrs. Sargent and her\r\n     daughters. Mr. Sargent, too, touches the very height of democratic\r\n     principle. Their association with monarchial governments and\r\n     subjects but makes them love our free institutions the more.[16]\r\n\r\n     Our last evening was spent with the Frau Dr. Liburtius--formerly\r\n     Henriette Hirschfeldt--a practicing dentist in Berlin since 1869,\r\n     who studied at the Philadelphia Dental College. No college in\r\n     Germany will admit women. Frau Libertius is dentist for various\r\n     members of the royal family as well as for the Sisters of Charity.\r\n     She says there are no dental colleges in the world equal to those\r\n     of America....\r\n\r\n     May 10.--At Worms--where Martin Luther made his glorious\r\n     declaration for the right of private judgment. There is a\r\n     magnificent monument in a beautiful square; Luther's is the central\r\n     statue--a standing one; below, at the corners, are sitting Huss,\r\n     Savonarola, Wycliffe and Peter Waldo, and on a still lower pedestal\r\n     are four more worthies--one of them Melancthon.... We spent Tuesday\r\n     at Cologne--visited the splendid cathedral and the church of St.\r\n     Ursula. The latter contains the bones of 11,000 virgins martyred at\r\n     Cologne in the fifth century. Whole broadsides of chapels are lined\r\n     with shelves of skulls, which the noble ladies of the twelfth\r\n     century partly covered with embroidery. Wednesday we took steamer\r\n     up the Rhine at six in the morning and landed at Mayence at eight.\r\n     It was a beautiful panorama, but not surpassing all others I have\r\n     seen. The vine-clad hillsides, the ruins of the old castles\r\n     (nothing like as many of them as I had thought) and the winding of\r\n     the river were all very lovely. We visited the cathedral, the\r\n     monuments of Gutenberg and Schiller, and then the fortress and the\r\n     remains of a Roman monument erected nine years before Christ....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  HEIDELBERG, May 11.\r\n\r\n     DEAR BROTHER D. R.: As I clambered among the ruins of Heidelberg\r\n     Castle today, I wished for each of my loved ones to come across old\r\n     ocean and look upon the remains of ancient civilization--of art and\r\n     architecture, bigotry and barbarism. I am enjoying my \"flying,\"\r\n     though I would not again make such a rush, but I am getting a good\r\n     relish for a more deliberate tour at some later day. All of life\r\n     should not be given to one's work at home, whether that be woman\r\n     suffrage, journalism or government affairs.\r\n\r\n     After being perpetually among people whose language I could not\r\n     understand, it was doubly grateful to be in the midst of not only\r\n     my countrymen but my dearest friends, and I enjoyed their society\r\n     so much that I almost forgot there were any wonders to be seen in\r\n     Berlin. But we did make an excursion to Potsdam--a jolly company of\r\n     us, Mr. and Mrs. Sargent and their gifted daughter Ella, also the\r\n     professor of Greek in your Kansas State University, Miss Kate\r\n     Stephens. She interpreted the utterances of the ever-present\r\n     guides, whose jabber was worse than Greek.\r\n\r\n     At Potsdam we were shown the very rooms in which Frederick the\r\n     Great lived and moved and had his being, plotted and planned to\r\n     conquer his neighbors. In the little church are myriads of tattered\r\n     flags, taken in their many wars, and two great stone caskets in\r\n     which repose the bodies of Frederick the Great and his father,\r\n     Frederick William, peaceful in death, however warlike in life. We\r\n     also visited the new palace where the present Emperor spends the\r\n     summer. We saw parlors, dining-rooms, bedrooms, the plain, narrow\r\n     bedstead the Emperor sleeps upon, the great workshop, in which are\r\n     maps and all sorts of material for studying and planning how to\r\n     hold and gain empires. I even peered into the kitchen and saw the\r\n     pitchers, plates, coffee-pots and stew-pans. It was my first chance\r\n     of a real mortal living look of things, so I enjoyed it hugely.\r\n     There are rooms enough in these palaces for an army of people. All\r\n     of these magnificent displays of wealth in churches, palaces and\r\n     castles, citadels, fortifications and glittering military shows of\r\n     monarchial governments, only make more conspicuous the poverty,\r\n     ignorance and degradation of the masses; and all pleasure in seeing\r\n     them is tinged with sadness.\r\n\r\nFrom the diary for May:\r\n\r\n     12.--Showering, but I walked up the mountain to pay a last visit to\r\n     Heidelberg Castle, the most magnificent ruin in Germany. Its\r\n     ivy-covered towers always will be pictured in my memory.\r\n\r\n     13.--At Strasburg. We have driven over the city, looked at the\r\n     wonderful fortifications and explored the great cathedral with its\r\n     famous clock. We heard the grand organ and saw 250 priests conduct\r\n     the services before an audience of 2,000 people, nine-tenths women.\r\n     Then to St. Thomas' church and the monument to Marshal Saxe.\r\n\r\n     14.--Left for Paris and had a beautiful ride through Alsace and\r\n     Lorraine, the lost kingdoms of France. It made me sad all day; I\r\n     wanted them returned to their own mother country. Theodore Stanton\r\n     and his wife Marguerite met us at the station.\r\n\r\n     15.--Madam de Barron has invited me to be her guest while here.\r\n     Such a delightful home and intelligent hostess! I have a charming\r\n     room, and this morning the sun is shining bright and warm and the\r\n     robins are singing in the trees. My continental breakfast--rolls,\r\n     butter and coffee--was sent to my room and, for the first time in\r\n     my life, I ate it in bed. What would my mother have said?\r\n\r\n     16.--Went to grand opera last night; magnificent house, scenery,\r\n     toilets, equipages; but with my three \"lacks,\" a musical ear, a\r\n     knowledge of French and good eyesight, I could not properly\r\n     appreciate the performance.\r\n\r\n     17.--Theodore took me to the Chamber of Deputies to see how\r\n     Frenchmen look in legislative assembly--very like Americans. Then\r\n     we called on friends at the American Exchange and the Hotel\r\n     Normandie, and I was too tired to go to U. S. Minister Morton's\r\n     reception at night.\r\n\r\n     22.--Called and had a good chat with Charlotte B. Wilbour, of New\r\n     York; called also on Grace Greenwood; visited the Hotel des\r\n     Invalides and walked in the gardens.\r\n\r\n     23.--Theodore and Marguerite took me to St. Cloud by boat and back\r\n     on top of tram-car. Delightful!\r\n\r\n     27.--Today, Sunday, we went to Père la Chaise and saw great crowds\r\n     of Communists hanging wreaths on the wall where hundreds of their\r\n     friends were shot down in 1871--a sorrowful sight.\r\n\r\n     28.--At noon we went to the College of France to witness the last\r\n     honors to Laboulaye, the scholar and Liberal. Saw his little study\r\n     and sadly watched the priests perform the services over his coffin.\r\n\r\n     29.--Left Paris at 9 A. M., Theodore and his little Elizabeth Cady\r\n     going with me to the station. The parks and forests are green and\r\n     lovely, the homes cozy and pretty, France is a beautiful country. I\r\n     have enjoyed the last three months exceedingly, but I am very, very\r\n     tired; and yet it is a new set of faculties which are weary, and\r\n     the old ones, so long harped upon, are really resting.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _To Miss Susan B. Anthony_,                                  PARIS.\r\n\r\n     MADAM: Having been informed of your arrival in Paris, I take the\r\n     liberty of writing to ask from your courtesy the favor of a short\r\n     interview. I have since several years heard of all the work you\r\n     have done in behalf of womankind, and I need not say how happy I\r\n     would be to meet a person who has so often been praised in my\r\n     presence. Hoping you will forgive my intrusion, and have the great\r\n     kindness to let me know when I may have the honor to call, I am,\r\n     madam, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n     [Of Le Soir.]                                          A. SALVADOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, May 20.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MRS. SPOFFORD: I have just come from a call on Mademoiselle\r\n     Hubertine Auclert, editor of La Citoyenne. I can not tell you how I\r\n     constantly long to be able to speak and understand French. I lose\r\n     nearly all the pleasure of meeting distinguished people, because\r\n     they are as powerless with my language as I with theirs. We called\r\n     also on Leon Richer, editor of La Femme. He thinks it inopportune\r\n     to demand suffrage for women in France now, when they are yet\r\n     without their civil rights. I wanted so much to tell him that\r\n     political power was the greater right which included the less....\r\n\r\n     Miss Foster has gone to London for presentation at Court. She had\r\n     the \"regulation\" dress made in Berlin--cream-white satin, low neck,\r\n     _no sleeves at all_, and a four-yard train!... I have not decided\r\n     when I shall go home, but before many months, for I long to be\r\n     about the work that remains undone. The fact is, I am weary of mere\r\n     sight-seeing. Amidst it all my head and heart turn to our battle\r\n     for women at home. Here in the old world, with its despotic\r\n     governments, its utter blotting out of woman as an equal, there is\r\n     no hope, no possibility of changing her condition, so I look to our\r\n     own land of equality for men, and partial equality for women, as\r\n     the only one for hope or work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       PARIS, May 24.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR RACHEL: I am glad to hear that you were not cheated out of\r\n     teetering through the palace halls in front of the princess, and\r\n     that you are not utterly prostrated by it.... I attended the\r\n     suffrage meeting last evening, and heard and saw several men\r\n     speak--_well_, I inferred from the cheering and shouting of\r\n     \"bravo!\"\r\n\r\n     This afternoon I visited the tomb of Napoleon. It surpasses every\r\n     mausoleum I have ever seen, not excepting that of Frederick the\r\n     Third and Queen Louise in Berlin. It is well that his memory should\r\n     be thus honored, for had he been born a hundred years later, when\r\n     the march of civilization had pointed to some other goal to gratify\r\n     his great nature than that of bloody conquest of empire, I believe\r\n     he would have stood at the head of those who strive to make free\r\n     and independent sovereigns of all men and all women. Everywhere\r\n     here are reminders of the ravages of war, the madness of ignorance\r\n     and unreason. I want to get away from them and their saddening\r\n     associations. You will think I am blue. So I am, from having lived\r\n     a purposeless life these three months. I don't know but the women\r\n     of America, myself in particular, will be the greater and grander\r\n     for it, but I can not yet see how this is to be....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  LONDON, June 7.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: For the hundredth time I am going to beg you to\r\n     shut up the house and come over here. It does seem as if now we two\r\n     sisters, left so alone, ought to be able to travel and enjoy\r\n     together. You can not know how I long to have you with me; it hurts\r\n     every minute to think of you treading round and round, with never a\r\n     moment of leisure or enjoyment. Surely you have given a mother's\r\n     love and care to our nieces for eight years, and now you can let\r\n     them go out from under your eye....\r\n\r\n     Rachel and I came up from Basingstoke on Sunday to attend a small\r\n     reception at Mrs. Jacob Bright's. Her husband has championed woman\r\n     suffrage in Parliament for years, and she has led the few who have\r\n     dared say, \"And married women, too, should have the franchise.\"\r\n     When the powers that be forbade her to include married women in the\r\n     Parliamentary Suffrage Bill now pending, Mrs. Bright withdrew and\r\n     started a bill for their property rights, which was passed last\r\n     session and is now in force.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Autograph: \"With kindest regards from Mr. Bright and\r\n     myself, yours very truly, Ursula M. Bright\"]\r\n\r\n     Monday morning we went to Bedford Park and spent two hours at\r\n     Moncure D. Conway's. His charming wife read us what a delegate here\r\n     from the American Unitarians says of Emerson, Alcott, Frothingham\r\n     and George Ripley--that all are wearying of their early theories\r\n     and theologies and returning to the old faith. Today I had an hour\r\n     with William Henry Channing, and he virtually told me this was true\r\n     of himself! I exclaimed: \"Do you mean to say that you have returned\r\n     to the belief in the immaculate conception of Jesus and in the\r\n     miracles--that you no longer explain all these things as you used\r\n     to do in your Bible readings at Rochester?\" He replied: \"I never\r\n     disbelieved in miracles. Man's levelling and tunnelling the\r\n     mountains is a miracle.\" Well, I was stunned and left. Even if all\r\n     these grand men, in old age, or when broken in body, decide that\r\n     the conclusions of their early and vigorous manhood were false,\r\n     which shall we accept as most likely to be true--the strong or the\r\n     weakened thought? It is very disheartening if we are so constituted\r\n     that with our deepest, sincerest study we grope and dwell in error\r\n     through our threescore and ten, and after those allotted years find\r\n     all we believed fact to be mere hallucination. It is--it must\r\n     be--simply the waning intellect returning to childish teachings.\r\n\r\n     That evening we visited the House of Commons and heard several\r\n     members speak as we peeped through the wire latticework of the\r\n     ladies' cage. The next afternoon we attended a large reception at\r\n     Mrs. J. P. Thomasson's, daughter of Margaret Bright Lucas and wife\r\n     of a member of Parliament. There we met the leading suffrage women.\r\n     Wednesday morning I went to Tunbridge Wells--thirty miles--to see\r\n     Mrs. Rose, who is trying the waters there in hope of relief.... I\r\n     should have told you that I dined on Sunday with Margaret\r\n     Lucas--John Bright's sister--and lunched today with Mrs. Mellen,\r\n     mother-in-law of General Palmer, of Colorado, president of the Rio\r\n     Grande R. R.--an elegant and wealthy woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  LONDON, June 22.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: ... Sunday morning we went to hear Stopford Brooke,\r\n     a seceder from the established church. I could see no diminution in\r\n     the poppings up and down, nor in the intonings and singsongs, but\r\n     when, after a full hour of the incantations, he came to his sermon\r\n     on the Christian duty of total abstinence, he gave us a splendid\r\n     one. Before commencing he said that, from his request the previous\r\n     Sunday, twenty members out of his congregation of 600 came to the\r\n     meeting to form a Church Total Abstinence Society, and ten of those\r\n     made special and earnest protest against the formation of such a\r\n     society! Can you imagine the chilliness of the spiritual air in\r\n     that church as he laid down the Christian's duty of denying himself\r\n     that he might save his fellow who had not the power to drink\r\n     moderately?\r\n\r\n     Afterwards, we called on Hon. William D. Kelley, wife and daughter\r\n     Florence, of Philadelphia. We also attended a reception at Emily\r\n     Faithfull's and met a number of nice people; then took underground\r\n     railway for Bedford Park and had tea with Eliza Orme, England's\r\n     first and only woman lawyer--or as nearly one as she can be and not\r\n     have passed the Queen's Bench. Her mother was lovely and so proud\r\n     of her daughter and glad to see me. Miss Orme has a partner, Miss\r\n     Richardson, who is a member of the London school board and has\r\n     visited our schools in America. She says London has none, public or\r\n     private, to compare with those of the United States.\r\n\r\n     The next morning we went to hear Laura Curtis Bullard read her\r\n     sketch of Mrs. Stanton, which is to go into Famous Women, the same\r\n     book for which Mrs. Stanton is writing me up. In the afternoon we\r\n     called on Miss Müller, who purchased a house and lives in it that\r\n     she may be a householder, as is necessary to hold office. She too\r\n     is a member of the school board. Miss Müller insisted that I should\r\n     talk to the ladies there, about thirty of them, and so I did,\r\n     sitting under the trees in her garden, where we had our tea. Thence\r\n     we went to the women's suffrage parlors and met some fifty or\r\n     sixty, and then to the Albemarle Club of both ladies and gentlemen,\r\n     the only one of the kind in London. Then came a meeting at the\r\n     Somerville Club--all ladies. A paper was read on the topic,\r\n     \"Sentiment is not founded on reason and is a hindrance to\r\n     progress,\" and followed by a bright discussion, in which both\r\n     Rachel and I were invited to take part. A pretty full afternoon and\r\n     evening!\r\n\r\n     Wednesday morning I studied on my speech for the 25th under the\r\n     auspices of the National Women's Suffrage Society. Harriot has so\r\n     divided the subject, that Mrs. Stanton is to take the educational,\r\n     social and religious departments, and S. B. A. the industrial,\r\n     legal and political. That evening we went to the Court Theater with\r\n     Mrs. Florence Fenwick Miller, another member of the London school\r\n     board. The nights are all days here now--daylight till after 9\r\n     o'clock and again at 3. Rachel and I lunched with Mr. and Mrs.\r\n     Jacob Bright, and had a splendid visit; then went to the school\r\n     board meeting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Priscilla Bright McLaren (Signed: \"Your loving friend\r\nPriscilla Bright McLaren.\")]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Cordially yours, Helen Taylor\"]\r\n\r\n     Saw there five of the seven women members, among them Miss Helen\r\n     Taylor, stepdaughter of John Stuart Mill, and the senior woman\r\n     member of the board. Today I spent an hour with Mrs. Lucas, sister\r\n     of John and Jacob Bright, and this afternoon Rachel and I are going\r\n     to a Women's Poor Law Guardian meeting, at which Mrs. Lucas is to\r\n     preside and other ladies to speak....\r\n\r\n     Just back from the meeting. In all England there are thirty-one\r\n     women poor law guardians. There are 19,000 of the guardians elected\r\n     and 1,000, mainly clergymen, are honorary. They have over 1,000,000\r\n     paupers to look after. The secretary, Mrs. Chamberlain, stated that\r\n     in her section of London there were 16,000. The guardians overlook\r\n     everything about the workhouses and asylums, get no pay, and yet\r\n     the public hesitates to put women on the board. One man stirred up\r\n     the handful present by saying, \"suffrage not only for widows and\r\n     spinsters, but for married women.\"\r\n\r\n     June 26.--Well, the ordeal is over and everybody is delighted.\r\n     Moncure D. Conway said: \"I have learned more of American history\r\n     from your speech than I ever dreamed had been made during the past\r\n     thirty years.\" Even the timid ones expressed great satisfaction.\r\n     Mrs. Stanton gave them the rankest radical sentiments, but all so\r\n     cushioned they didn't hurt. Mrs. Duncan McLaren came down from\r\n     Edinburgh and Mrs. Margaret Parker from Dundee. Rachel said I made\r\n     a good statement of the industrial, legal and political status of\r\n     women in America. We went to tea with Mrs. Jacob Bright; then I\r\n     took dinner with Mrs. Stanton at Mrs. Mellen's, getting up from\r\n     table at 9:15 P. M.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Most sincerely yours, Jane Cobden\"]\r\n\r\n     Saturday Rachel and I drove four hours in Miss Müller's carriage\r\n     and called on Lady Wilde, a bright, quaint woman. Sunday morning I\r\n     went to Friends' meeting and had a look at John Bright, though I\r\n     was not sure it was he until after the meeting was over; then he\r\n     was gone, and I not introduced to him! In the afternoon I called on\r\n     Miss Jane Cobden, daughter of Richard Cobden, a charming woman.\r\n     Yesterday I presented her with a set of our History in memory of\r\n     her noble father, and for her own sake also. I will not foreshadow\r\n     the coming days but they are busy indeed. You will see that the\r\n     Central Committee have put both my name and Mrs. Stanton's on the\r\n     card for the meeting of July 5....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  LONDON, June 28.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: It is now just after luncheon and at 4 o'clock we\r\n     are to be at Mrs. Jacob Bright's reception, tomorrow evening at one\r\n     at Mrs. Thomasson's, which she gives to friends for the special\r\n     purpose of meeting Stanton and Anthony, and Saturday at Frances\r\n     Power Cobbe's--and so we go. Yesterday morning Miss Frances Lord--a\r\n     poor law guardian--escorted us through Lambeth workhouse. It has\r\n     1,000 inmates and 700 more in the infirmary, and gives out-door\r\n     relief to 2,000 besides.\r\n\r\n[Jacob Bright presided over the Prince's Hall meeting, and William\r\nWoodall over that at St. James' Hall.[17] All of the prominent\r\nnewspapers in Great Britain contained editorials on the meetings, and\r\nnoted especially the addresses of Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton,\r\nspeaking of them in a dignified and respectful manner.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  LONDON, July 13.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: My last letter was mailed the 3d. That afternoon I\r\n     was at Rebecca Moore's reception. We dined at Miss Müller's and\r\n     afterwards went to Horn's assembly rooms to a suffrage meeting. Her\r\n     sister Eva, wife of Walter McLaren, M.P., was one of the\r\n     speakers.... At 9 P. M., we went to a Fourth of July reception at\r\n     Mrs. Mellen's, given in honor of Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony, and\r\n     a brilliant affair it was. About 150 were there; she had elegant\r\n     refreshments; and the young American girls gave songs, recitations,\r\n     violin music, etc. Grace Greenwood recited her \"Mistress\r\n     O'Rafferty\"--a woman's rights poem in Irish brogue--very rich and\r\n     racy; her daughter Annie sang, also Mrs. Carpenter, of Chicago;\r\n     Kate Hillard, of Brooklyn, Adelaide Detchon, the actress, and\r\n     Mildred Conway recited; Frank Lincoln impersonated; Nathaniel\r\n     Mellen sang a negro jubilee melody; Maude Powell played the violin.\r\n     She is not fifteen yet and is a charming player. The company did\r\n     not disperse until after one.\r\n\r\n     July 5, drove to Mrs. Mellen's to a 10 o'clock breakfast, and\r\n     worked on Rachel's report of my Prince's Hall speech--you'll find\r\n     it in full in the Englishwoman's Review. In the evening Mrs.\r\n     Thomasson gave a splendid dinner-party, and afterwards took us all\r\n     in carriages to the St. James' Hall suffrage demonstration, where\r\n     there was a fine audience of about 2,000.... Next morning I went to\r\n     a meeting of the suffrage friends from various towns who had come\r\n     up for the demonstration. At 8 P. M. Mrs. McLaren took me to the\r\n     House of Commons, to witness Mr. Hugh Mason present the Women's\r\n     Suffrage Bill; so I heard all the speeches pro and con, up to 1:30\r\n     A. M., and how tired I was! Mr. Jacob Bright's was the strongest\r\n     and most earnest.\r\n\r\n     The morning of July 7, at the suffrage rooms, I heard strong\r\n     protests against the way Mr. Mason disclaimed all intention of\r\n     enfranchising married women. He carried the matter too far even for\r\n     the most timid. In the afternoon, we went to the Somerville Club,\r\n     and Rachel spoke beautifully on the need of union and co-operation\r\n     among women. I followed her, and Mrs. McLaren moved a vote of\r\n     thanks.... Rachel left for Antwerp this evening, to meet her mother\r\n     and sister, and I returned to my room, lonesome enough. Sunday I\r\n     lunched with Mrs. Lucas and Mrs. McLaren. I had calls from three\r\n     factory-women, who told a sad story of the impossibility of getting\r\n     even a dollar ahead by the most frugal and temperate habits.\r\n\r\n     Have I told you that I have a new dark garnet velvet? I wore it\r\n     with my point lace at Mrs. Mellen's reception on the Fourth, and\r\n     the India shawl I have worn today for the first time.... Tuesday I\r\n     went with Mrs. Lucas to the Crystal Palace at Sydenham to a great\r\n     national temperance demonstration. More than 50,000 people passed\r\n     the gates at a shilling apiece, and we saw a solid mass of 5,000\r\n     boys and girls from all parts of the kingdom seated in a huge\r\n     amphitheater, singing temperance songs--a beautiful sight. Then in\r\n     another part of the palace was an audience of 2,000 listening to\r\n     speeches. Among the speakers was Canon Wilberforce, a grandson of\r\n     the great Abolitionist but a degenerate one. He said the reason the\r\n     temperance movement was now progressing so rapidly was because the\r\n     persons who led it were praying people, and that the Lord had\r\n     willed it, and all depended on whether it was kept in the Lord's\r\n     hands--if not, then it would fall back like the old Washingtonian\r\n     movement in America. Mrs. Lucas was very wroth, and so was I. He\r\n     never spoke of woman except as \"maiden aunt\" or \"old grandmother,\"\r\n     and advised the boys to take a little wine for the stomach's sake.\r\n\r\n     At 6 o'clock we went to Miss Müller's where I remained until today.\r\n     She took me to the Gaiety Theater to see Sarah Bernhardt. What a\r\n     magnificent actor! I never saw any man or woman who so absolutely\r\n     buried self out of sight and became the very being personated.\r\n     Though I couldn't understand a single word, I enjoyed it all until\r\n     the curtain fell at half-past eleven. I was tired beyond telling,\r\n     but felt richly repaid by the seeing. She must be master of her\r\n     divine art thus to impress one by action alone. Today Mrs. McLaren\r\n     invites me to dine at her son's, Charles McLaren, M.P. All this is\r\n     written in a hurry but is perhaps better than nothing. It is so\r\n     difficult to clutch a moment to write.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  LONDON, July 19.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR RACHEL: ... I am to attend a suffrage meeting at the\r\n     Westminster Palace Hotel Hall this afternoon, and tomorrow at 10:25\r\n     A. M. I start for Edinburgh with Mrs. Moore. I am bound to suck all\r\n     the honey possible out of everybody and everything as they come to\r\n     me or I go to them. It is such unwisdom, such unhappiness, not to\r\n     look for and think and talk of the best in all things and all\r\n     people; so you see at threescore and three I am still trying always\r\n     to keep the bright and right side up. I am expecting a great\r\n     ferment at the meeting today, for those who agree with Mrs. Jacob\r\n     Bright have asked Mrs. Stanton to confer with them about what they\r\n     shall do now. She advises them to demand suffrage for all women,\r\n     married and single; but I contend that it is not in good taste for\r\n     either of us to counsel public opposition to the bill before\r\n     Parliament....\r\n\r\n     I wrote you about Miss ----. She is settled in the conviction that\r\n     she never will marry any man--not even the one with whom she has\r\n     had so close a friendship for the past ten years. She feels that to\r\n     do the work for the world which she has mapped out she must eschew\r\n     marriage, accepting platonic friendship but no more. I tell her she\r\n     is giving her nature a severe trial by allowing herself this one\r\n     particular friend, that if he does not in the end succeed in\r\n     getting her to marry him, it will be the first escape I ever have\r\n     heard of. She is a charming, earnest, conscientious woman, and I\r\n     feel deeply interested in her experiment.\r\n\r\n[After being royally entertained in London and making many little trips\r\ninto the beautiful country around, Miss Anthony left for Edinburgh July\r\n20, carrying with her many pleasant remembrances of friends.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  EDINBURGH, July 22.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: Here I am in Huntley Lodge, the delightful home of\r\n     Mrs. Elizabeth Pease Nichol, whose name we so often used to see in\r\n     the Liberator and the Anti-Slavery Standard, and of whom we used to\r\n     hear from Mr. Phillips and others who had visited England. We had a\r\n     most cordial welcome from Mrs. Nichol--a queenly woman. She is now\r\n     seventy-seven, and lives in this handsome house, two miles from the\r\n     center of the city, with only her servants....\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Nichol has gone to her room to rest and Mrs. Moore and I are\r\n     writing in the little, sunny southeast parlor. I have an elegant\r\n     suite of three rooms, the same Mr. Garrison occupied when he\r\n     visited here in 1867 and in 1877. Mrs. Nichol is one of the few\r\n     left of that historic World's Anti-Slavery Convention of 1840. We\r\n     are going to a \"substantial tea\" with Dr. Agnes McLaren, daughter\r\n     of Duncan McLaren. She is very bright--spent four years in France\r\n     studying her profession--has a good practice, takes a house by\r\n     herself, and invites to it her friends. So many young Englishwomen\r\n     are doing this, and indeed it is a good thing for single women to\r\n     do.\r\n\r\n     The suffrage society--Eliza Wigham, president, Jessie M. Wellstood,\r\n     secretary--has invited a hundred or more of the friends to an\r\n     afternoon tea on Tuesday next in honor of my visit, and I am to\r\n     make a brief speech, so what to say and how to say it come\r\n     uppermost with me again....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Elizabeth Pease Nichol (Signed: \"Elizabeth Pease\r\nNichol\")]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE RAVEN HOTEL, DROITWICH, August 5.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIEND SUSAN B. ANTHONY: I have often wished to write thee\r\n     since we parted in London, my heart has been so full of loving\r\n     thought. It has been a greater trial than I can describe that I\r\n     have been denied the pleasure of receiving thee in my home in\r\n     Edinburgh. If it had been only for an hour, I should have looked\r\n     back on that hour as one of great privilege. But even if we should\r\n     not meet again, I have had a pleasure which seems almost like a\r\n     dream to me, in having made the personal acquaintance of thyself\r\n     and dear Mrs. Stanton....\r\n\r\n     That thou shouldst have been on the 1st of August with the\r\n     Elizabeth Pease of those grand anti-slavery times, revived in me\r\n     the thought I expressed in moving a vote of thanks to thee and Mrs.\r\n     Cady Stanton for the noble addresses you gave at the Prince's Hall\r\n     Meeting in London; ... that you had been brought here to give us\r\n     the hand of rejoicing fellowship; and that it gave me great faith\r\n     to believe the God of Justice was leading us on, and had brought\r\n     England and America together by your presence amongst us at this\r\n     most critical and hopeful time of our agitation....\r\n\r\n     I have addressed thee in the dear singular person, because it\r\n     seemed to me in harmony with the noble simplicity of thy character,\r\n     and also more affectionate--just as I feel toward thee. Believe me,\r\n     dear friend--I love so to call thee--thine very affectionately,\r\n\r\n                                             PRISCILLA BRIGHT MCLAREN.\r\n\r\n[The diary notes many teas and luncheons in Edinburgh, drives to Melrose\r\nAbbey, Holyrood Palace, Roslyn Castle, to the celebrated monuments, the\r\nold cathedrals and the university; calls from distinguished professors\r\nand those interested in philanthropic movements, visits to public\r\ninstitutions, and lovely gifts from the new friends. Every day of the\r\nmonth was filled with pleasant incidents.

While in Edinburgh Mrs. Nichol drove us out to\r\n     Craigmillar Castle, where I saw the very rooms in which Queen Mary\r\n     lived. We bought for a shilling a basket of strawberries\r\n     plucked--no, \"pulled\"--the old man who sold them said, from the\r\n     very garden in which berries and vegetables were \"pulled\" for Queen\r\n     Mary three hundred years ago. One evening Professor Blackie, of the\r\n     Edinburgh University, dined with Mrs. Nichol. At my reception he\r\n     had said he did not want to \"see refined, delicate women going down\r\n     into the muddy pool of politics,\" and I asked him if he had ever\r\n     thought that, since the only places which were too filthy for women\r\n     were those where men alone went, perhaps they might be so from lack\r\n     of women. At dinner Mrs. Nichol rallied him on the report that he\r\n     had been converted, and he admitted that it was true; so as he was\r\n     leaving I said, \"Then I am to reckon an Edinboro' professor among\r\n     my converts?\" He seized my hand and kissed it, saying, \"I'll seal\r\n     it with a kiss.\" Don't be alarmed--he is fully eighty years of age\r\n     but blithe and frolicsome--sang and acted out a Scotch war-song in\r\n     the real Gaelic.\r\n\r\n     On August 1 we saw 200 medical students capped--and not a woman\r\n     among them, because the powers ruled that none should be admitted.\r\n     That afternoon we called on Professor Masson, a great champion of\r\n     co-education. We took tea with Mrs. Jane and Miss Eliza Wigham. The\r\n     stepmother, now eighty-two, was Jane Smeale in 1840. In their house\r\n     have visited Henry C. Wright, Parker Pillsbury, and of course Mr.\r\n     Garrison. Mrs. Nichol went with us to Melrose by rail, from which\r\n     we drove to Abbotsford....\r\n\r\n     Tuesday at 2 o'clock Miss Osgood and I landed at Stirling. At 4:30\r\n     we reached Callander, where I found no trunk, and not a man of them\r\n     could give a guess as to its whereabouts. They give you no check\r\n     here, but just stick a patch on your trunk. I had expected not to\r\n     find it at every stop, and now it was gone for sure; but the\r\n     station-master was certain he could find it and forward it to me,\r\n     so he wrote out its description and telegraphed in every direction.\r\n     Meanwhile we went to a hotel for luncheon and there in the hall was\r\n     my trunk! Nobody knew why or how it got there and all acknowledged\r\n     our American check system superior. I was raging at their\r\n     stupidity, and no system at all, but laughingly said, \"You ought to\r\n     send this trunk free a thousand miles to pay for my big scold at\r\n     you.\" The man good-naturedly replied, \"Where will you have it\r\n     sent?\" I answered \"Oban,\" and he booked it.\r\n\r\n     At 6 o'clock we took the front seat with the driver on a great high\r\n     stage which we mounted by a ladder--they call the stage the\r\n     \"machine\"--and drove a few miles to the Trossachs Hotel, past Loch\r\n     Achray and Loch Vennachar.... While the rain rested this noon I\r\n     took a walk up the ravine and it seemed very like going up the\r\n     mountain at Grandfather Anthony's. Indeed, there is nothing here\r\n     more beautiful than we have in America, only everything has some\r\n     historic or poetic association....\r\n\r\n\r\n          BRUNTSFIELD LODGE, WHITEHOUSE LOAN, EDINBURGH, August 23.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: Here am I, back in Edinboro' again, at Dr.\r\n     Jex-Blake's delightful home--at least one hundred and fifty years\r\n     old, with an acre or more of garden all enclosed with a six-foot\r\n     wall. Lodge means a walled-in house; loan means lane, and the\r\n     street took its name from a white house which two hundred and fifty\r\n     years ago stood in this road. Every day the doctor has taken me a\r\n     long and beautiful ride in her basket-carriage, driving her own\r\n     little pony, White Angel, or her hay horse, while her boy-groom\r\n     rides in his perch behind. Today she drove me through Lord\r\n     Rosebery's park of thousands of acres. It is lovely as a native\r\n     forest--the roads macadamized all through--and a palace-like\r\n     residence set deep within....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  AMBLESIDE, August 27.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: Last Thursday I left Edinburgh for Penrith, which\r\n     has a fine view of the lake and the hills beyond. Next morning I\r\n     took steamer at Pooley Bridge. The trip the whole length of the\r\n     lake was beautiful, but can not compare with Lake George--indeed,\r\n     nothing I have seen equals that--but the hills (mountains, they\r\n     call them here), the water and the sky all were lovely. At\r\n     Patterdale I had a cup of tea, with bread and butter and the\r\n     veritable orange marmalade manufactured at Dundee. Thence I took a\r\n     stage over Kirkstone Pass, and walked two miles up the hills to a\r\n     small hotel with a signboard saying it is the highest inhabited\r\n     house in England, 1,114 feet above the sea--not very much beside\r\n     Denver's 6,000 and others in Colorado 10,000 or 12,000. Arrived at\r\n     Ambleside to find the hotel overflowing, so they sent me to a\r\n     farmer's house where I had a good bed, splendid milk and sweet\r\n     butter. Saturday morning I went by coach to Coniston, then railway\r\n     to Furness Abbey, a seven-hundred-year-old ruin of magnificent\r\n     proportions. After four hours there, I took a train to Lakeside and\r\n     then steamer up Lake Windermere back to Ambleside. The hotel still\r\n     being full, \"the Boots,\" as they call the porter or runner, found\r\n     me lodgings at a private house, where I am now. It is the tiniest\r\n     little stone cottage, but they have a cow, so I am in clover. My\r\n     breakfasts consist of a bit of ham, cured by the hostess, a boiled\r\n     egg, white and graham bread with butter and currant jam, and a cup\r\n     of tea.\r\n\r\n     Saturday evening I strolled out and entered the gate of Harriet\r\n     Martineau's home. On the terrace I met the present occupants, Mr.\r\n     and Mrs. William Henry Hills. They invited me to call in the\r\n     morning, when they would be happy to show me over the house. In\r\n     naming the hour they said: \"We never go to church--we are Liberal\r\n     Friends--_real_ Friends.\" At that I immediately felt at home with\r\n     them. I called and spent two hours sitting and chatting in the\r\n     drawing-room where Harriet Martineau received her many\r\n     distinguished guests, and in the kitchen saw the very same table,\r\n     chairs and range which were there when she died, and sitting on the\r\n     doorsill was the same black-and-yellow cat, said to be fourteen\r\n     years old now. The Hills invited me to 5 o'clock tea, which we took\r\n     in the library, where Miss Martineau used to sit and study as well\r\n     as entertain her guests at dinner. It seemed impossible to realize\r\n     that I was actually in her house. It is not large and is covered\r\n     with ivy, which grows most luxuriantly everywhere. It fronts on a\r\n     large field, much lower than the knoll on which it stands, and fine\r\n     hills stretch off beyond. The old gardener, who has been here more\r\n     than thirty years, still lives in a little stone cottage just under\r\n     the terrace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours affectionately, H. Martineau.\"]\r\n\r\n     Mr. Hills is a great lover of America and its institutions. He is\r\n     one of the very few I have met here who really love republicanism.\r\n     Nearly every one clings to the caste and class principle, thinks\r\n     the world can not exist if a portion of the people are not doomed\r\n     to be servants, and that for the poor to have an ambition to rise\r\n     and become something more than their parents makes them\r\n     discontented. \"Yes,\" I answer, \"and that is just what I want them\r\n     to be, because it is only through a wholesome discontent with\r\n     things as they are, that we ever try to make them any better.\"...\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  DUBLIN, September 10.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: ... I stayed in Belfast some days, and visited the\r\n     Giant's Causeway with Miss Isabella Tod, amidst sunshine and\r\n     drenching showers; still it was a splendid sight, fully equal to\r\n     Fingal's Cave. The day before, we went nearly one hundred miles\r\n     into the country to a village where she spoke at a temperance\r\n     meeting. Here we were guests of the Presbyterian minister--a cousin\r\n     of Joseph Medill, of the Chicago Tribune--and a cordial greeting he\r\n     and his bright wife gave me. They have three Presbyterian churches\r\n     in that one little village. All welcomed the woman speaker most\r\n     kindly, but not a person could be urged to vote down the whiskey\r\n     shops, as these are licensed by a justice of the peace, appointed\r\n     by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who receives his appointment\r\n     from the Queen of England!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours most truly, Isabella M. S. Tod\"]\r\n\r\n     So all she could ask was that every one should become a total\r\n     abstainer. I do not see how they can submit to be thus voiceless as\r\n     to their own home regulations.\r\n\r\n     Saturday I took tea with Mrs. Haslam, a bright, lovely \"come-outer\"\r\n     from the Friends. She had invited some twenty or thirty to be\r\n     present at eight, and I spoke, they asking questions and I\r\n     answering. Among them were a son of the Abolitionist Richard D.\r\n     Webb, and ever so many nephews and nieces. Eliza Wigham's brother\r\n     Henry and his wife had come ten miles to be there.... This\r\n     afternoon I am going to the common council meeting with Alfred\r\n     Webb, who is a member and a strong Home Ruler. The question of\r\n     electing their own tax collector is to be discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  CORK, September 16.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: ... Your heart would break if you were here to see\r\n     the poverty and rags, and yet the people seem cheerful under it\r\n     all. Something surely must be wrong at the root to bear such fruit.\r\n     I have had an awfully \"hard side of a board time\" of ten hours in a\r\n     third-class car, paying therefor just as much as I would on the N.\r\n     Y. Central for a first-class ticket. I not only saved $4.25 by\r\n     going third-class, but I saw the natives. Men, women, boys and\r\n     girls who had been to the market towns with their produce were on\r\n     the train, and to see them as they tumbled in toward evening, at\r\n     town after town, one would think that whiskey and tobacco were the\r\n     main articles they bought. Any number of men and boys, and at least\r\n     four women, were drunk enough, and they brought bottles with them\r\n     and added to their puling idiocy as they went on. Nothing short of\r\n     a pig-sty could match the filth, but it is only in that class of\r\n     cars that you see anything of the vast number of poor farmers and\r\n     laborers. If they can not pay exorbitant rates, refined, educated\r\n     men and women are thrust into pens and seated face to face with the\r\n     smoking, drinking, carousing rabble. I have everywhere protested\r\n     against this outrage and urged the women to demand that the railway\r\n     companies should give them separate cars, with no smoking\r\n     allowed....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  LEAMINGTON, October 1.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR RACHEL: ... I must have told you of my good times at\r\n     Belfast with Miss Tod, who gave a reception for me and I had a\r\n     welcome all round.\r\n\r\n     Miss Osgood met me at Cork, and we went by rail to Macroom. Tuesday\r\n     morning we visited the convent, nuns' schools, and the poorhouse\r\n     with 400 helpless mortals, old and young; then took an Irish\r\n     jaunting-car, and were driven some forty miles through \"the Gap\" to\r\n     Glengariff. It rained almost all the way, much to our disgust. Next\r\n     morning we packed into two great stages with thirty or more others,\r\n     and started for the lakes of Killarney; but soon the rain poured\r\n     again, and as we were losing so much of the scenery we stopped\r\n     half-way at Kenmare. We visited the convent and the Mother Abbess\r\n     showed us every cranny. Thirty girls were at work on beautiful\r\n     Irish point and Limerick lace. These nuns have 400 pupils, and give\r\n     200 of the poorest their breakfast and lunch--porridge and a bit of\r\n     bread. At two we took stage again, the sky looked promising, but\r\n     alas! for half an hour it fairly poured. Then it grew lighter, and\r\n     we got very fine views of hills and dales. Killarney _is_\r\n     lovely....\r\n\r\n     Saturday I sauntered along the streets of Killarney, passed the\r\n     market, and saw all sorts of poor humanity coming in with their\r\n     cattle to sell or to buy. Many rode in two-wheeled carts without\r\n     seat or spring, drawn by little donkeys, and nearly all the women\r\n     and girls were bareheaded and barefooted. On the bridge I saw some\r\n     boys looking down. I looked too and there was a spectacle--a\r\n     ragged, bareheaded, barefooted woman tossing a wee baby over her\r\n     shoulders and trying to get her apron switched around to hold it\r\n     fast on her back. I heard her say to herself, \"I'll niver do it,\"\r\n     so I said, \"Boys, one of you run down there and help her.\" At that\r\n     instant she succeeded in getting the baby adjusted, and to my\r\n     horror took up a bundle from the grass and disclosed a second baby!\r\n     Then _I_ went down. I learned that she had just come from the\r\n     poorhouse, where she had spent six weeks, and before going further\r\n     had laid her two three-weeks-old boys on the cold, wet grass, while\r\n     she washed out their clothes in the stream. The clothing was the\r\n     merest rags, all scrambled up in a damp bundle. She had heard her\r\n     old mother was ill in Milltown and had \"fretted\" about her till she\r\n     could bear it no longer, so had started to walk ten miles to her. I\r\n     hailed a boy with a jaunting-car--told her to wait and I would take\r\n     her home--got my luncheon--fed the boy's horse, bought lunch for\r\n     boy and woman--and off we went, she sitting on one side of the car\r\n     with her two babies, wet bundle, two milk bottles and rubber\r\n     appendages, bare feet and flying hair, and I on the other, with the\r\n     boy in front.\r\n\r\n     For a long way both babies cried; they were blue as pigeons, and\r\n     had on nothing but little calico slips, no socks even. She had four\r\n     children older than these--a husband who went to fairs selling\r\n     papers and anything he could to support them all--and an aged\r\n     father and mother who lived with them. She said if God had given\r\n     her only one child, she could still help earn something to live on,\r\n     but now He had given her two, she couldn't. When we reached\r\n     Milltown I followed her home. It was in a long row of one-room\r\n     things with a door--but no window. Some peat was smouldering under\r\n     a hole in the roof called a chimney, and the place was thick with\r\n     smoke. On the floor in one corner was some straw with a blanket on\r\n     it, which she said was her bed; in another were some boards\r\n     fastened into bed-shape, with straw packed in, and this belonged to\r\n     her father and mother. Where the four other children, with the\r\n     chickens and the pig, found their places to sleep, I couldn't see.\r\n     I went to the home of another tenant, and there again was one room,\r\n     and sitting around a pile of smoking-hot potatoes on the cold, wet\r\n     ground--not a board or even a flag-stone for a floor--were six\r\n     ragged, dirty children. Not a knife, fork, spoon or platter was to\r\n     be seen. The man was out working for a farmer, his wife said, and\r\n     the evidences were that \"God\" was about to add a No. 7 to her\r\n     flock. What a dreadful creature their God must be to keep sending\r\n     hungry mouths while he withholds the bread to fill them!...\r\n\r\n     I went back to Killarney heart-sick; wrote letters Sunday, and\r\n     Monday took train for Limerick, where I rushed round for an hour or\r\n     two.... Then went on to Galway. Tuesday morning took the mail-car\r\n     to Connemara, and had company all the way--a judge, an Irish M.P.,\r\n     and two Dublin drummers--with whom I talked over the Irish problem.\r\n     I had meant to make the tour of the western coast up to\r\n     Londonderry, but my courage failed. It was to be the same\r\n     soul-sickening sight all the way--only, I was assured, worse than\r\n     anything yet seen. I took the stage back to Galway, every one\r\n     saying it was sure to be a fine day, but it proved to be terrific\r\n     wind and rain, and before I had gone ten miles my seat was a pool\r\n     of water and it took all my skill to keep my umbrella right side\r\n     out.... Once while the driver changed horses I stood in front of a\r\n     big fire on the hearth of the best farmer's house I have seen here.\r\n     Everything was clean and cheerful--two rooms--a bed made up with a\r\n     spotless white spread--the old father smoking and the wife cooking\r\n     dinner. She lifted a wooden cover from a jar and proudly showed me\r\n     her butter--patted down with her hands, I could see--and near by\r\n     was another jar with milk. Think of butter being made in a room\r\n     full of tobacco-smoke! Then I went my last ten out of the fifty\r\n     miles, having been soaking wet for eight hours. At my hotel I had\r\n     room and fire on a \"double-quick,\" bath-tub and hot water, and put\r\n     myself through a regular grooming. In the morning I rode around\r\n     Galway, saw Queen's College and the bay, and then took train for\r\n     Belfast.\r\n\r\nFrom the diary:\r\n\r\n     Sept. 11.--In Dublin. The Professor of Arabic took me through\r\n     Trinity College, with its library of 200,000 volumes. Thence to the\r\n     old Parliament House, now the Bank of Ireland. In the afternoon\r\n     Alfred Webb went with me to the National League rooms and from\r\n     there to Thomas Webb's for tea, where I saw the names of Garrison\r\n     and N. P. Rogers written in 1840. We called on Michael Davitt, the\r\n     leader of the Irish Land League, who impressed me as an earnest,\r\n     honest man, deeply-rooted in the principles of freedom and\r\n     equality, and claiming all for woman that he does for man.\r\n\r\n     Sept. 16.--At Youghal. Visited the home of Sir Walter Raleigh, Lady\r\n     Hennessy, eighty years old, showing me around. Found in a library\r\n     Children of the Abbey, and read again the story of Lord Mortimer\r\n     and Amanda. Once it thrilled my young soul, but now it seems\r\n     inexpressibly thin.\r\n\r\n     Sept. 20.--While I was talking in the car today with an Irishwoman\r\n     about the poverty here, another behind me shouted: \"It is very ill\r\n     manners for an American to come over here and abuse the English\r\n     government.\"\r\n\r\n     Sept. 29.--In Belfast. O, how I would like to purchase _all_ the\r\n     linen I want for myself and my friends! Have bought as much as I\r\n     dared and after all perhaps I'm cheated--but it's done, so I won't\r\n     worry.\r\n\r\n     Sept. 30.--Landed at Fleetwood and went direct to Rugby. Walked all\r\n     around the famous school, but had not courage to go in and\r\n     introduce myself to Doctor Jex-Blake, whose sister's guest I had so\r\n     recently been.\r\n\r\n     Oct. 1.--At Leamington. Went direct to Kenilworth Castle, a grand\r\n     old ruin; the home of Leicester, where Queen Elizabeth visited him\r\n     in the olden days.\r\n\r\n     Oct. 2.--Mrs. Mullinor called at our hotel and accompanied us to\r\n     Warwick Castle, a splendid pile. We lunched with her, and when Mr.\r\n     M. put fork into the roast he remarked: \"Wife asked me what she\r\n     should order for dinner and I said, 'a leg of mutton, for Americans\r\n     never see such a thing at home.'\" We smiled and ate it with a\r\n     relish.\r\n\r\n     Oct. 3.--At Stratford on Avon, and we have visited every spot\r\n     sacred to the memory of Shakespeare, and walked through the meadows\r\n     and down by the riverside....\r\n\r\n     Oct. 4.--In Oxford. I have visited many of the colleges, and as I\r\n     saw where all the millions of dollars had been expended for the\r\n     education of boys alone, I groaned in spirit and betook me to\r\n     Somerville and St. Margaret's Halls, where at least there is a\r\n     shelter for girls, and a beginning.\r\n\r\n     Oct. 5.--In London; and how almost like getting home it seems to\r\n     come back here.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  LONDON, October 7.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: Mrs. Stanton feels that she must stay with Hattie\r\n     till the baby is a month old, and then have a week for farewell\r\n     visits in London. Cousins Fannie and Charles Dickinson are here.\r\n     Today I learned that I should have a chance to see and hear John\r\n     Bright at a convention of the Liberal Party at Leeds, October 17;\r\n     all these together have made me put off leaving a little longer.\r\n     Since yesterday we have been in the midst of a genuine London fog.\r\n     It is now 10 A. M. and even darker than it was two hours ago, when\r\n     we dressed and breakfasted by gaslight. I saw smoky, foggy days\r\n     here last March but they could not compare with this, and yet the\r\n     people say, \"O, this is nothing to what November will bring.\"...\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  LONDON, October 27.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: Since I last wrote you I have visited Leeds where I\r\n     was the guest of Mrs. Hannah Ford, who has an elegant home--Adel\r\n     Grange. There were several other guests who had come to attend the\r\n     great Liberal demonstration, among them Mrs. Margaret Priestman\r\n     Tanner, a sister-in-law of John Bright, and his son Albert. Mrs.\r\n     Alice Scatcherd, of Leeds, was the person who had the sagacity to\r\n     get women sent as delegates and secure them admission on terms of\r\n     perfect equality. The amendment was a great triumph. She invited\r\n     the friends to meet next day at her house, where I saw John\r\n     Bright's daughter, Mrs. Helen Clark, and Richard Cobden's, Miss\r\n     Jane Cobden. Both made speeches at the convention, and most fitting\r\n     it was they should--the daughters of the two leading Radicals of a\r\n     half century ago.\r\n\r\n     On Saturday, Mrs. Ford took me to Haworth, the home of the Brontë\r\n     sisters. It is a bleak enough place now, and must have been even\r\n     more so forty or fifty years ago when those sensitive plants lived\r\n     there. A most sad day it was to me, as I looked into the little\r\n     parlor where the sisters walked up and down with their arms around\r\n     each other and planned their novels, or sat before the fireplace\r\n     and built air-castles. Then there were the mouldering tombstones of\r\n     the graveyard which lies in front and at one side of the house, and\r\n     the old church-pew, directly over the vault where lay their loved\r\n     mother and two sisters. And later, when Emily and Anne and the\r\n     erring brother Branwell had joined the others, poor Charlotte sat\r\n     there alone. The pew had to be removed every time the vault was\r\n     opened to receive another occupant. Think of those delicate women\r\n     sitting in that fireless, mouldy church, listening to their old\r\n     father's dry, hard theology, with their feet on the cold,\r\n     carpetless stones which covered their loved dead. It was too\r\n     horrible! Then I walked over the single stone pathway through the\r\n     fields toward the moor, opened the same wooden gates, and was, and\r\n     still continue to be, dipped into the depths of their utter\r\n     loneliness and sadness, born so out of time and place. How much the\r\n     world of literature has lost because of their short and\r\n     ill-environed lives, we can guess only from its increased wealth in\r\n     spite of all their adverse conditions.\r\n\r\n     From Leeds I went to Birmingham to attend an Anti-Contagious\r\n     Diseases Acts conference, and there heard the serene, lovely\r\n     Josephine E. Butler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Josephine E. Butler\"]\r\n\r\n     Miss Müller has invited Mrs. Stanton and me to spend the rest of\r\n     our time with her. Mrs. Lucas and some others are going to\r\n     Liverpool to say good-by to us. The cordiality, instead of\r\n     decreasing, grows greater and greater as the day of departure draws\r\n     near.... I dread stepping on shipboard, but long to set foot upon\r\n     my native soil again. Only think, I shall have been gone over nine\r\n     months when I land in New York!\r\n\r\nFrom the diary:\r\n\r\n     Oct. 13.--Last evening at Mrs. Rose's I met the daughter of Charles\r\n     Bradlaugh, a talented young woman, whom the college refused to\r\n     admit to botany lectures because of her father's atheism.\r\n\r\n     Oct. 18.--At Leeds. Liberal party convention; went this evening to\r\n     hear John Bright remember to forget to mention the extension of\r\n     suffrage to women in 1869 and 1870, and the property law for\r\n     married women in 1882. He did not meet my expectations as a\r\n     speaker, but far surpasses any other Englishman I have heard. None\r\n     of them can touch Wendell Phillips.\r\n\r\n     Oct. 28.--Had a four hours' row on the Thames today with some\r\n     friends. This evening went to hear Mrs. Annie Besant.\r\n\r\n     Nov. 2.--Have been out to Basingstoke to see the new baby. Mrs.\r\n     Mona Caird lunched with us. Have heard Michael Davitt, Mr. Fawcett\r\n     and Helen Taylor, all masterly speakers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Sincerely Yours, Frances Power Cobbe\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  LONDON, November 6.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SISTER: ... As soon as I finish this scribble I am to have\r\n     5 o'clock tea with Frances Power Cobbe. Tomorrow I go shopping,\r\n     Thursday Millicent Garrett Fawcett is to dine with us, and Mrs.\r\n     Peter Taylor is to call here, and all are to take \"substantial tea\"\r\n     with dear, noble Mrs. Lucas, and then go to hear Henry Fawcett on\r\n     the political issues. Friday afternoon we receive at Miss Müller's.\r\n     Saturday morning I leave for Bristol to visit Miss Mary Estlin,\r\n     Mrs. Tanner and the Misses Priestman, three sisters-in-law of John\r\n     Bright, who give a reception in my honor. The 12th I visit Margaret\r\n     E. Parker, at Warrington, and the next afternoon Mrs. Stanton and I\r\n     both go to Alderley Edge, near Manchester, to the home of Mr. and\r\n     Mrs. Jacob Bright.[18] On the 14th we attend the annual meeting of\r\n     the Manchester Women's Suffrage Association, and on the 16th go to\r\n     Liverpool where a reception will be given us in the afternoon. That\r\n     evening we shall spend at our hotel with the friends who go to see\r\n     us off, and on the 17th we give ourselves to old ocean's care in\r\n     the Cunarder Servia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Believe me, yours very truly, M. G.\r\nFawcett.\"]\r\n\r\n     Don't worry now if you do not hear from me again until I touch\r\n     Yankee soil; and don't worry if the wind blows or if you learn the\r\n     vessel is late or lost. If the Servia fail to land me safe and\r\n     sound, don't repine or stop because I am not, but buckle on a new\r\n     and stronger harness and do double work for the good cause of\r\n     woman. You have the best of judgment in our work and are capable of\r\n     doing much if only you had confidence in yourself, so whatever\r\n     comes to me, do you be all the more for the less that _I_ am.\r\n\r\nHalf of Miss Anthony's nine-months' trip abroad had been spent in Great\r\nBritain. To her all the other attractions of the old world were as\r\nnothing compared with its living, breathing humanity. On the continent\r\nshe was deprived of any exchange of thought with its people because she\r\nspoke no language but her own, and this made her prefer England; but\r\nthere was another and a stronger interest--the great progressive\r\nmovement which was going forward in regard to woman. Here she found\r\nwomen of fine intellect and high social position engaged in the same\r\nwork to which she had given more than thirty years of her own life; and\r\nhere she met sympathy and recognition which would have been impossible\r\nin any other country in Europe. Her central thought in going to Great\r\nBritain had been to secure the co-operation of Englishwomen in holding\r\nan international suffrage convention. At first her proposition met with\r\nno response. The most radical of English women were conservative\r\ncompared to those of America, but after they had become thoroughly\r\nacquainted with Mrs. Stanton and herself and prejudice had been\r\nsupplanted by confidence, the idea began to be more favorably regarded.\r\nOne serious difficulty in the way of the proposed convention lay in the\r\nfact that the suffrage women of England and Scotland were not themselves\r\nin thorough unison as to plans and purposes. No definite action was\r\ntaken until the last afternoon of their stay, when, at the reception\r\ngiven in their honor by Dr. Ewing Whittle, in Liverpool, with the hearty\r\nconcurrence of Mrs. McLaren, Mrs. Lucas, Mrs. Scatcherd and Mrs. Parker,\r\nwho had accompanied Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton to see them safely on\r\nboard their vessel, a strong committee was formed to promote\r\ninternational organization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Margaret Bright Lucas (Signed: \"Yours affectionately\r\nMargaret Bright Lucas\")]\r\n\r\nThey sailed from Liverpool on the Servia, November 17, 1883. Among their\r\nfellow voyagers were Mrs. Cornelia C. Hussey, of Orange, N. J., to whom\r\nthe cause of woman suffrage and Miss Anthony personally are deeply\r\nindebted; and Mrs. Margaret B. Sullivan, of Chicago, the distinguished\r\neditorial writer. There was some lovely weather, which was greatly\r\nenjoyed, but heavy fogs impeded the ship and it was just ten days from\r\nthe time of starting when, on November 27, they steamed into New York\r\nharbor and stepped again on the shores of loved America.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] The many inquiries and directions in regard to the suffrage work,\r\nand the loving messages to friends and relatives at home, are omitted in\r\nthe extracts made from Miss Anthony's letters; but they are of constant\r\noccurrence, and show that these were never absent from her thoughts.\r\n\r\n[15] While in Florence, Miss Anthony was entertained by the Countess de\r\nResse, daughter of Elizabeth B. Phelps, of New York, and by the Princess\r\nKoltzoff-Massalsky, the distinguished author and artist, known through\r\nEurope by her pen-name of Dora d'Istria.\r\n\r\n[16] Miss Anthony occupied some rainy days, while here, in wrapping up\r\npapers and writing letters which she put in her official envelopes,\r\nbearing the revolutionary mottoes, \"No just government can be formed\r\nwithout the consent of the governed,\" \"Taxation without representation\r\nis tyranny.\" After a few days a dignified official appeared at the\r\nAmerican legation with a large package of mail bearing the proscribed\r\nmottoes, and said, \"Such sentiments can not pass through the post-office\r\nin Germany.\" So in modest, uncomplaining wraps the letters and papers\r\nstarted again for the land of the free.--E.

Apropos of\r\nthe very beautiful allusion you made to Mrs. Cady Stanton's popularity\r\nand the effect produced by her personal appearance, I must tell you of a\r\nremark made by my little son John immediately after your departure. I\r\nfound him sitting on the sofa in my bedroom, thinking deeply. 'Mamma,'\r\nhe said, 'I wish you could get me a photograph of Miss Anthony. I think\r\nshe has such a fine face. There is something about it so firm and yet so\r\nkind.' I said, 'Do you like her better than Mrs. Stanton?' 'Oh dear,\r\nyes, much better,' replied Johnnie. So you see she does not monopolize\r\nall the admiration!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nCONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS--VISIT TO NEW ORLEANS.\r\n\r\n1884-1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the newspapers had a welcome for Miss Anthony. In a two-column\r\nreport in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle she is quoted as saying:\r\n\r\n     \"I can scarcely tell you of the hospitality extended, the dinners,\r\n     teas and receptions given in our honor. I had no idea we were so\r\n     well-known in Great Britain or that there was such cordial feeling\r\n     toward us. Of course, I met chiefly those known as Liberals and the\r\n     sympathizers with our cause. Public sentiment there is rapidly\r\n     growing in our favor. In the discussion I heard in Parliament not a\r\n     Conservative uttered a word against the suffrage already possessed\r\n     by women but relied upon the hackneyed argument that when married\r\n     women were included there would be trouble.\"\r\n\r\n     \"You saw the Queen, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n     \"No; I thought more of seeing the Bright family than the Queen and\r\n     I never happened to be near where she was. I really had very little\r\n     leisure to look around. I am ashamed to say I did not visit\r\n     Westminster until the morning before I came away, but it was simply\r\n     for lack of time. The social idea was of more importance to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York Evening Telegram said editorially: \"The statement of Miss\r\nSusan B. Anthony, in another column, illustrates the superb\r\ndetermination of that champion of woman's political rights. In the\r\nstruggle which has constituted her life-work she has the rare advantage\r\nof not being able to comprehend defeat. Battling under the inspiration\r\nof an enthusiast--of a fanatic, some may be disposed to say--she knows\r\nno such word as fail. The most disheartening reverses appear to her\r\ninspired imagination but steps in an undeviating march of progress. It\r\nwas enthusiasm such as this that made the career of Joan of Arc.\r\nWithout it, not even the broad intellect and strong soul of Miss Anthony\r\ncould sustain the burden of the struggle which she is called upon to\r\nlead.\" The Washington correspondent of the Cleveland Leader thus began a\r\nlong interview:\r\n\r\n     Susan B. Anthony is back from Europe, and is here for the winter's\r\n     fight in behalf of woman suffrage. She seems remarkably well, and\r\n     has gained fifteen pounds since she left last spring. She is\r\n     sixty-three, but looks just the same as twenty years ago. There is\r\n     perhaps an extra wrinkle in her face, a little more silver in her\r\n     hair, but her blue eyes are just as bright, her mouth as serious\r\n     and her step as active as when she was forty. She would attract\r\n     attention in any crowd. She is of medium height and medium form but\r\n     her face is wonderfully intellectual, and she moves about like the\r\n     woman of a purpose that she is. She says she experiences far\r\n     different treatment by public men now from what she did years ago.\r\n     The statesman of the past always came to her with a smirk on his\r\n     face as though he considered woman's rights nonsensical and thought\r\n     himself wonderfully condescending to take notice of her at all.\r\n     \"Now,\" says she, \"public men look upon our mission as a matter of\r\n     business, and we are considered from that standpoint.\"\r\n\r\nThe interview closed:\r\n\r\n     \"One question more, Miss Anthony. Will you please tell me what is\r\n     your highest ideal of the woman of the future?\"\r\n\r\n     \"It is hard to say,\" was the reply. \"The woman of the future will\r\n     far surpass the one of the present, even as the man of the future\r\n     will surpass the one of today. The ages are progressive, and I look\r\n     for a far higher manhood and womanhood than we now have. I think\r\n     this will come through making the sexes co-equal. When women\r\n     associate with men in serious matters, as they do now in frivolous,\r\n     both will grow stronger and the world's work will be better done. I\r\n     look for the day when the woman who has a political or judicial\r\n     brain will have as much right to sit in the Senate or on the\r\n     Supreme Bench as men have; when women will have equal property,\r\n     business and political rights with men; when the only criterion of\r\n     excellence or position shall be the ability and character of the\r\n     individual; and this time will come. All of the Western colleges\r\n     are now open to women, and send forth more than 2,000 women\r\n     graduates every year. Think of the effect upon the race to come!\r\n     The woman of the future will be a better wife, mother and citizen\r\n     than the woman of today.\"\r\n\r\nThere were, however, some discordant notes in the symphony of pleasant\r\nthings which by 1883 had become customary in the newspapers. For\r\ninstance, the Cincinnati Times-Star headed its interview: \"Susan\r\nSpeaks--Miss Anthony Corralled by a Times-Star Correspondent--The Old\r\nLady Wears Good Clothes and Stops at First-class Hotels--Bubbling about\r\nthe Ballot.\" The smart reporter described the size of her foot, devoted\r\na paragraph to the question whether her teeth were natural or\r\nartificial, and said: \"There must be money in being a reformer, for Miss\r\nAnthony lives at the Riggs House in good style, and expects to be there\r\nall winter, and this, after a summer in Europe, would be a pretty severe\r\ndrain on any but a long purse.\" When one thinks of Miss Anthony's\r\nuniform kindness and courtesy to reporters, always granting an interview\r\nno matter how tired or how busy she might be, and assisting them in\r\nevery possible way with information and suggestions, it is astonishing\r\nthat any one of them could indulge in petty, personal criticism and\r\ninnuendoes.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony had now another friend at court, Col. Halbert S. Greenleaf,\r\nof Rochester, having been elected to Congress. Both he and his wife were\r\nstrong and influential advocates of suffrage, and her warm personal\r\nfriends. The diary shows that every day of December she was conferring\r\nwith officials and their wives who were friendly to the cause, making\r\nconverts wherever possible and co-operating actively with the District\r\ncommittee in all the drudgery of detail necessary to a successful\r\nconvention. It is only by reading her diary that one can understand what\r\na mental agony it was for Miss Anthony to press this matter upon\r\ncongressmen, year after year, to be repulsed by those who were opposed\r\nand only tolerated by those in favor, who had many other matters on hand\r\nwhich to them seemed of much greater importance. \"Oh, if men only could\r\nknow how hard it is for women to be forever snubbed when they attempt to\r\nplead for their rights! It is perfectly disheartening that no member\r\nfeels any especial interest or earnest determination in pushing this\r\nquestion of woman suffrage, to all men only a side issue,\" she writes in\r\nthis little confidant; but not even in her letters is there ever a note\r\nof discouragement. To the world at large and to those who were\r\nassociated with her, she was always brave, bright and hopeful. It causes\r\na keen heartache to reflect upon how she crucified herself for fifty\r\nyears, unfaltering and uncomplaining, in order to make conditions better\r\nfor womankind. To Hon. William D. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, who believed\r\nin woman suffrage and voted for it, but did not feel enough interest to\r\npush the matter in Congress, she wrote, January 6, 1884:\r\n\r\n     No one shrinks more from making herself obnoxious than I do, and\r\n     but for the sake of all women, your darling Florence included, I\r\n     should never again say a word to you on the subject of using your\r\n     influence to secure the passage of a Sixteenth Amendment\r\n     proposition. Last winter you put off my appeal for help with, \"This\r\n     is the short session and the tariff question is of momentous\r\n     importance.\" Now, since this is the \"long session,\" will you not\r\n     take hold of this work, and with the same earnestness that you do\r\n     other questions?\r\n\r\n     It is cruel for you to leave your daughter, so full of hope and\r\n     resolve, to suffer the humiliations of disfranchisement she already\r\n     feels so keenly, and which she will find more and more galling as\r\n     she grows into the stronger and grander woman she is sure to be. If\r\n     it were your son who for any cause was denied his right to have his\r\n     opinion counted, you would compass sea and land to lift the ban\r\n     from him. And yet the crime of denial in his case would be no\r\n     greater than in that of your daughter. It is only because men are\r\n     so accustomed to the ignoring of woman's opinions, that they do not\r\n     believe women suffer from the injustice as would men; precisely as\r\n     people used to scout the idea that negroes, whose parents before\r\n     them always had been enslaved, suffered from that cruel bondage as\r\n     white men would.\r\n\r\n     Now, will you not set about in good earnest to secure the\r\n     enfranchisement of woman? Why do not the Republicans push this\r\n     question? The vote on Keifer's resolution showed almost a party\r\n     line. Of the 124 nays, only 4 were Republicans; while of the 85\r\n     yeas, only 13 were Democrats. Even should you fail to get another\r\n     committee, the discussion and the vote would array the members and\r\n     set each man and party in their true places to be seen of all men,\r\n     and all women too.\r\n\r\nThe term of the select committee on woman suffrage having expired with\r\nthe close of the Forty-seventh Congress, a new one was appointed by the\r\nSenate of the Forty-eighth. The House committee on rules refused to\r\nreport such a committee but placed the question in the hands of\r\nRepresentative Warren Keifer, of Ohio, who made a gallant fight for it\r\non the floor, during which he said: \"Is not the right of petition a\r\nconstitutional right? Has not woman, in this country at least, risen\r\nabove the rim and horizon of servitude, discredit and disgrace, and has\r\nshe not a right, representing as she does in many instances great\r\nquestions of property, to present her appeals to this national council\r\nand have them wisely and judiciously considered? I think it is due to\r\nour wives, daughters, mothers and sisters to afford them an avenue\r\nthrough which they can legitimately and judicially reach the ear of this\r\ngreat nation.\"\r\n\r\nHe was ably assisted by Mr. Belford, of Colorado. The measure to appoint\r\nthis committee was bitterly opposed by Mr. Reagan, of Texas, who said in\r\na long speech: \"When woman so far misunderstands her duty as to want to\r\ngo to working on the roads and making rails and serving in the militia\r\nand going into the army, I want to protect her against it.\" The vote\r\nresulted--yeas, 85, nays, 124; absent or not voting, 112.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the return of members from the holiday recess, Miss\r\nAnthony wrote to each of the 112 asking how he would vote if the\r\nquestion came up again. To these letters 52 replies were received, 26\r\nfrom Republicans, all of whom would vote yes; 26 from Democrats, 10 of\r\nwhom would vote yes, 10, no; while 6 did not know how they would vote.\r\nAs these 36 affirmative votes added to the 85 yeas would so nearly have\r\novercome the adverse majority, John D. White, of Kentucky, at the\r\nsolicitation of Miss Anthony, made another earnest effort in February to\r\nsecure the desired committee, but the Democrats refused to allow the\r\nquestion to come to a vote. She was greatly disappointed at the failure\r\nto get the select committee, but afterwards became of the opinion that\r\nit was more advantageous to return to the old plan of working through\r\nthe judiciary committee.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony had to be continually on the alert to head off zealous but\r\ninjudicious women who were determined to commit the suffrage movement to\r\nthe various ologies and isms of the day, and especially to personal\r\nmatters. Even a woman so intellectually great as Mrs. Stanton could not\r\nbe relied upon always to make her individual opinions subserve what was\r\ndemanded of her position as president of the National Association. In\r\nJanuary Miss Anthony received a document which Mrs. Stanton had prepared\r\nas an \"open letter,\" to be signed by both of them officially and given\r\nto the press, congratulating Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to a\r\nwhite woman and sympathizing with him because of the adverse criticism\r\nit had called out! She especially urged that he be given a prominent\r\nplace on the program at the approaching convention. Miss Anthony replied\r\nat once:\r\n\r\n     I do hope you won't put your foot into the question of\r\n     intermarriage of the races. It has no place on our platform, any\r\n     more than the question of no marriage at all, or of polygamy, and,\r\n     so far as I can prevent it, shall not be brought there. I beg you\r\n     therefore not to congratulate him publicly. Were there a\r\n     proposition to punish the woman and leave the man to go scot free,\r\n     then we should have a protest to make against the invidious\r\n     discrimination.\r\n\r\n     The question of the amalgamation of the different races is a\r\n     scientific one, affecting women and men alike. I do not propose to\r\n     have it discussed on our platform. Our intention at this convention\r\n     is to make every one who hears or reads believe in the grand\r\n     principle of equality of rights and chances for women, and if they\r\n     see on our program the name of Douglass every thought will be\r\n     turned toward the subject of amalgamation and away from that of\r\n     woman and her disfranchised. Neither you nor I have the right thus\r\n     to complicate or compromise our question, and if we take the bits\r\n     in our teeth in one direction we must expect our compeers to do the\r\n     same in others. You very well know that if you plunge in, as your\r\n     letter proposes, your endorsement will be charged upon me and the\r\n     whole association. Do not throw around that marriage the halo of a\r\n     pure and lofty duty to break down race lines. Your sympathy has run\r\n     away with your judgment. Lovingly and fearfully yours.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the \"open letter\" was not published.\r\n\r\nEverybody's burdens were laid upon Miss Anthony's shoulders. In looking\r\nover the mass of correspondence it seems as if each writer wanted\r\nsomething and looked to her to supply it. All expected her to take the\r\nlead, to do the planning, to bear the responsibility, and usually she\r\nwas equal to the demand, but even her brave spirit could not resist an\r\noccasional groan on the pages of the diary. When a new accession to the\r\nranks, from whom she expected great assistance, wrote, \"I do not know\r\nhow to plan but tell me what to do and I will obey,\" she says, \"My heart\r\nsinks within me; so few seem to use their brain-power on ways and\r\nmeans.\" And again: \"This drain of helpless women, able and willing to\r\nwork but utterly ignorant of how to do it, wears me out body and soul.\"\r\nShe was greatly distressed because so many of the younger women were\r\nfrequently incapacitated by illness, and writes: \"O, the weak-bodied\r\ngirls of the present generation, they make me heart-sick!\"\r\n\r\nBut never did the women themselves know of these feelings. To the\r\nyounger ones she wrote: \"Don't give up 'beat' at any of those places\r\ntill I have dropped my plummet into them.... Your young shoulders will\r\nhave to learn to bear the crotchets of all sorts of people and not bend\r\nor break under them.... Put all the blame on me; they may abuse me but\r\nnot you.... It makes my heart ache every minute to see you so tired....\r\nVent all your ill-feelings on me but keep sweet as June roses to\r\neverybody else. It does not pay to lose your temper.... You will have to\r\nlearn to let people pile injustice on you and then trust to time to\r\nright it all.\" If on rare occasions she spoke a word of censure, it was\r\nfollowed by a letter in the next mail, full of sorrow and repentance.\r\nShe always signed herself, even in the darkest hours, \"Yours with love\r\nand hope.\" Beautiful optimism, sublime courage!\r\n\r\nSunday, February 3, 1884, Miss Anthony read in the morning papers of the\r\nsudden death of Wendell Phillips. He had been to her always the one\r\nbeing without a peer, the purest, sweetest, best of men. The news\r\noverwhelmed her with grief and she wrote at once to Robert Purvis:\r\n\r\n     How cut down I am at the telegram, \"Wendell Phillips is dead,\" and\r\n     I know you are equally so. I hope you can go on to Boston to the\r\n     funeral, and help tenderly to lay away that most precious human\r\n     clay. Who shall say the fitting word for Wendell Phillips at this\r\n     last hour as lovingly and beautifully as he has done so many, many\r\n     times for the grand men and women who have gone before him? There\r\n     seem none left but you and Parker Pillsbury to pour out your souls'\r\n     dearest love in his memory. Would that I had the tongue of an angel\r\n     and could go and bear my testimony to the grandeur of that noblest\r\n     of God's works! I can think of no one who can rightly and fully\r\n     estimate that glorious character. What a sad hour for his beloved\r\n     wife! He said to me on my last visit: \"My one wish has come to be\r\n     that I may live to bury Ann.\" He doubtless knew of his impending\r\n     disease of the heart. On whose shoulders will fall the mantle of\r\n     Wendell Phillips? When will the children of men ever listen to\r\n     such a matchless voice? How poor the world seems! In sorrow I am\r\n     with you.\r\n\r\nShe could not stay away and, inclement as was the weather, went to\r\nBoston three days later to look for the last time upon the loved face.\r\n\r\nAt the request of many ladies in Washington the National Convention was\r\nheld in March, instead of earlier in the winter, to avoid the social\r\ndistractions which always precede the Lenten season. The ladies were\r\npleasantly received by President Arthur.[19] This was an exceptionally\r\nbrilliant convention, a noteworthy feature being the large number of\r\nletters containing the greetings of the distinguished men and women of\r\nGreat Britain, whom Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton had met and interested\r\nduring their trip abroad. The following was read from Matthew Simpson,\r\nsenior bishop in the Methodist church, among his last public utterances,\r\nas he died a few months later:\r\n\r\n     For more than thirty years I have been in favor of suffrage for\r\n     woman. I was led to this position, not by the consideration of the\r\n     question of natural rights or of alleged injustice or of inequality\r\n     before the law, but by what I believed would be her influence on\r\n     the great moral questions of the day. Were the ballot in the hands\r\n     of women, I am satisfied that the evils of intemperance would be\r\n     greatly lessened; and I fear, without that ballot, we shall not\r\n     succeed against the saloons and kindred evils in large cities. You\r\n     will doubtless have many obstacles placed in your way; there will\r\n     be many conflicts to sustain; but I have no doubt that the coming\r\n     years will see the triumph of your cause, and that our higher\r\n     civilization and morality will rejoice in the work which\r\n     enlightened women will accomplish.[20]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"M. Simpson\"]\r\n\r\nBoth Senate and House committees granted hearings, and eloquent\r\naddresses were made by delegates from many States. Miss Anthony said in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n     This is the fifteenth year we have appeared before Congress in\r\n     person, and the nineteenth by petitions, asking national protection\r\n     for women in the exercise of their right to vote. In the winter of\r\n     1865 and 1866 we sent your honorable body a ten-thousand prayer,\r\n     asking you not to put \"male\" in the second section of the proposed\r\n     Fourteenth Amendment; and again we appealed to you by thousands of\r\n     petitions that you would add \"sex\" after \"race or color\" in the\r\n     Fifteenth, but all to no avail. Then by an eighty-thousand petition\r\n     in 1871 we demanded the enactment of a declaratory law that women\r\n     had the right to vote under the first section of the Fourteenth\r\n     Amendment. This, too, was denied us, not only by Congress but by\r\n     the Supreme Court, which held that the framers of the amendment had\r\n     only \"colored men\" in their thought, therefore none others could\r\n     come within its purview. From 1876 to the present we have from year\r\n     to year poured into Congress hundreds of thousands of petitions\r\n     asking you to take the initiative step for another amendment which\r\n     shall specifically prohibit the disfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\n     But, you say, why do you not go to your several States to secure\r\n     this right? I answer, because we have neither the women nor the\r\n     money to make the canvasses of the thirty-eight States, school\r\n     district by school district, to educate each individual man out of\r\n     the old belief that woman was created to be his subject. Four State\r\n     legislatures submitted the question of striking \"male\" from their\r\n     constitutions--Kansas, Michigan, Colorado and Nebraska--and we made\r\n     the best canvass of each which was possible for a disfranchised\r\n     class outside of all political help. Negro suffrage was again and\r\n     again overwhelmingly voted down in various States; and you know,\r\n     gentlemen, that if the negro had never had the ballot until the\r\n     majority of white men, particularly the foreign born, had voted\r\n     \"yes,\" he would have gone without it until the crack of doom. It\r\n     was because of this prejudice of the unthinking majority that\r\n     Congress submitted the question of the negro's enfranchisement to\r\n     the legislatures of the several States, to be adjudicated by the\r\n     educated, broadened representatives of the people. We now appeal to\r\n     you to lift the decision of _our_ question from the vote of the\r\n     populace to that of the legislatures, that thereby you may be as\r\n     considerate and just to the women of this nation as you were to the\r\n     freedmen.\r\n\r\n     Every new privilege granted to woman has been by the legislatures.\r\n     The liberal laws for married women, the right of the wife to own\r\n     and control her inherited property and separate earnings, the right\r\n     of women to vote at school elections in a dozen States, full\r\n     suffrage in two Territories, all have been gained through the\r\n     legislatures. Had any one of these beneficent propositions been\r\n     submitted to the vote of the rank and file do you believe a\r\n     majority would have placed their sanction upon it? I do not; and I\r\n     beg you, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, that you will\r\n     at once recommend to the House the submission of the proposition\r\n     now before you, and thus place the decision of this great\r\n     constitutional question of the right of one-half the people of this\r\n     republic to a voice in the government, with the legislatures of the\r\n     several States. You need not fear that our enfranchisement will\r\n     come too suddenly or too soon by this method. After the proposition\r\n     shall have passed Congress by the requisite two-thirds vote, it may\r\n     require five, ten or twenty years to secure its ratification by the\r\n     necessary three-fourths of the State legislatures; but, _once\r\n     submitted by Congress, it always will stand until ratified by the\r\n     States_.\r\n\r\n     It takes all too many of us women from our homes and from the works\r\n     of charity and education in our respective localities, even to come\r\n     to Washington, session after session, until Congress shall have\r\n     submitted the proposition, and then to go from legislature to\r\n     legislature, urging its adoption. But when you insist that we shall\r\n     beg at the feet of each individual voter of every one of the\r\n     States, native and foreign, black and white, learned and ignorant,\r\n     you doom us to incalculable hardships and sacrifices, and to most\r\n     exasperating insults and humiliations. I pray you to save us from\r\n     the fate of waiting and working for our freedom until we shall have\r\n     educated the ignorant masses of men to consent to give their wives\r\n     and sisters equality of rights with themselves. You surely will not\r\n     compel us to await the enlightenment of all the freedmen of this\r\n     nation and the newly-made voters from the monarchial governments of\r\n     the old world!\r\n\r\n     Liberty for one's self is a natural instinct possessed alike by all\r\n     men, but to be willing to accord liberty to another is the result\r\n     of education, of self-discipline, of the practice of the golden\r\n     rule. Therefore we ask that the question of equality of rights to\r\n     women shall be decided by the picked men of the nation in Congress,\r\n     and the picked men of the several States in their respective\r\n     legislatures.\r\n\r\nThe Senate committee again submitted a majority report in favor of a\r\nSixteenth Amendment enfranchising women, signed by T. W. Palmer, Blair,\r\nLapham and Anthony. The minority report, by Joseph E. Brown, Cockrell\r\nand Fair, began: \"The undersigned believe that the Creator intended that\r\nthe sphere of the males and females of our race should be different,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe House Judiciary Committee gave a majority report in the\r\nnegative.[21] The minority report in favor was signed by Thomas B. Reed,\r\nMaine; Ezra B. Taylor, Ohio; Thomas M. Browne, Indiana; Moses A. McCoid,\r\nIowa. It is one of the keenest, clearest expositions of the absurdity of\r\nthe objections against woman suffrage that ever has been made, and ends\r\nwith this trenchant paragraph:\r\n\r\n     It is sometimes asserted that women now have a great influence in\r\n     politics through their husbands and brothers. That is undoubtedly\r\n     true. But this is just the kind of influence which is not wholesome\r\n     for the community, for it is influence unaccompanied by\r\n     responsibility. People are always ready to recommend to others\r\n     what they would not do themselves. If it be true that women can not\r\n     be prevented from exercising political influence, is not that only\r\n     another reason why they should be steadied in their political\r\n     action by that proper sense of responsibility which comes from\r\n     acting themselves? We conclude then, that every reason which in\r\n     this country bestows the ballot upon man is equally applicable to\r\n     the proposition to bestow the ballot upon woman, and in our\r\n     judgment there is no foundation for the fear that woman will\r\n     thereby become unfitted for all the duties she has hitherto\r\n     performed.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony mailed 500 packages of copies of this report to different\r\npoints for distribution. Upon the urgent invitation of the suffrage\r\nassociation of Connecticut she went there for a few days to assist at\r\ntheir State convention, but in a letter to Mrs. Spofford she said: \"I\r\nshall return tomorrow night, if possible. I keep thinking of those men\r\nat the Capitol not doing what I want them to.\" She afterwards wrote to\r\nMay Wright Sewall:\r\n\r\n     My plan is to get away from here the minute I can do so without\r\n     letting our work suffer in Congress. A week ago the House Judiciary\r\n     Committee voted down a motion to print our \"hearing\" speeches.\r\n     Yesterday I went up and called out a Democrat who I knew had voted\r\n     \"no,\" and hence could move to reconsider, and he promised to go\r\n     back and thus move, and did so, and Mr. Browne, of Indiana, asked\r\n     leave of the House to print them. I wish you would write to Mr.\r\n     Browne that he is splendid and our main help now in the committee.\r\n     Cockrell has been trying to prevent printing the Senate \"hearing,\"\r\n     but Blair, Lapham, Palmer and Anthony are bound it shall be\r\n     printed. Still, all would fall flat and dead if some one were not\r\n     here to keep them in mind of their duty to us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours &c, Thomas M. Browne\"]\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony remained in Washington till April 14, managing her forces\r\nlike an experienced general until the last gun had been fired. When she\r\nreturned home ready to begin work on the History, she found to her\r\namazement that the officer who had been charged with preparing the\r\nreport of the Sixteenth National Suffrage Convention, a woman of great\r\nliterary ability, had given it up in despair, declaring that it would be\r\nutterly impossible to make anything creditable out of such a mass of\r\nunsatisfactory material, most of which would have to be entirely\r\nre-written. Miss Anthony did not stop to sit down and weep, but wrote\r\nher at once to send to Rochester every document she had in her\r\npossession. Then, taking all of them to Mrs. Stanton, who had gone to\r\nher old paternal home at Johnstown, they arranged, edited, re-wrote and\r\nput into shape the conglomerate of letters, speeches, etc., and in less\r\nthan two weeks prepared and sent to the printer the most complete report\r\never made of a National convention.[22]\r\n\r\nThe middle of May, after two years' interruption, Miss Anthony and Mrs.\r\nStanton set themselves diligently to finish the third volume of the\r\nHistory of Woman Suffrage, all the boxes and trunks of material having\r\nbeen shipped from Tenafly. Although submerged in the avalanche of old\r\ndocuments, Miss Anthony's mind was full of current events. She writes in\r\nher journal June 2: \"I wait with bated breath the news from Oregon,\r\nwhere today the men are voting on the question of woman's\r\nenfranchisement. My heart almost stands stills. I hope against hope, but\r\nstill I hope.\" When the news of the defeat comes, she says: \"Dear Mrs.\r\nDuniway, with all that debt left on her shoulders, which she assumed to\r\ncarry on the campaign! I felt so agonized for her that on the very day\r\nof election I rushed to the bank and sent her $100. We must not leave\r\nher to carry it alone, after all her brave work. I have written a dozen\r\nletters to friends asking them to give her assistance. I feel like a\r\nlion champing the bars of his cage, shut up here digging and delving\r\namong the records of the past when I long to be out doing the work of\r\nthe present.\" In a letter received from Senator Palmer at this time he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     I fully sympathize with your regret and chagrin over the reverse in\r\n     Oregon but hardly with your conclusion, viz., that \"the women\r\n     should stop asking legislatures to submit this question to the\r\n     electors, to have it killed by the majority, made up of ignorance\r\n     and whiskey, native and foreign, and all go to Congress for\r\n     success,\" etc. It seems to me that nothing is to be lost and much\r\n     to be gained by local discussions and temporary defeats. You know\r\n     in 1850 Webster, in his unfortunate Revere House speech,\r\n     stigmatized the anti-slavery movement as \"a rub-a-dub agitation,\"\r\n     and Wendell Phillips closed his masterly philippic thereon with\r\n     what was accepted as a motto: Agitate! Agitate!! Agitate!!! Another\r\n     decade of that rub-a-dub agitation sufficed to divide the continent\r\n     in a political earthquake and from out the chasm the negro emerged\r\n     to citizenship. It may still require years to educate a majority of\r\n     our women to demand the franchise and a majority of our men or\r\n     their representatives in Congress and the legislatures, to proclaim\r\n     it, but that the way leads through constant agitation I make no\r\n     doubt. The still pool casts nothing to shore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"With high personal esteem I have the honor to\r\nbe, Very truly yours, T W Palmer\"]\r\n\r\nShe watches events across the water and writes on July 7: \"Well, the\r\nHouse of Lords is today discussing whether 2,000,000 farm laborers shall\r\nhave the ballot placed in their hands, while the half-million, more or\r\nless, women who employ them are left without it. What an outrage that\r\nMr. Gladstone refused to allow Mr. Woodall's amendment to his bill to be\r\nat least voted upon! He applied the party whip and made voting for the\r\nwoman suffrage amendment disloyalty to the government, and over one\r\nhundred Liberals, who had previously declared themselves in favor of\r\nwomen's sharing in this new extension of the franchise, voted against\r\nallowing them to do so. I do not believe a more humiliating abnegation\r\nof principle at the behest of a party leader ever was witnessed in our\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\nThe national political conventions in the summer of 1884 received the\r\nusual appeal to recognize the claims of women. The Republican,\r\nDemocratic, Anti-Monopoly and Greenback parties equivocated, although\r\nthe last two nominated Benjamin F. Butler, an avowed advocate of woman\r\nsuffrage; the Prohibition convention relegated the question to the\r\nStates[23]. The American party put in a plank and nominated S. C.\r\nPomeroy, a champion of woman suffrage, but it had too small a following\r\nto offer any hope of success. Blaine was not a friend, Logan was an\r\nearnest one; Cleveland was not acceptable to many women, Hendricks had\r\nnever shown himself favorable. In the midst of such a conglomeration the\r\nwise thing for all women would have been to remain non-partisan and take\r\nno share in the campaign. Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton, however,\r\nwatching events from their secluded nook, issued a manifesto urging\r\nwomen to stand by the Republican party. They were led to take this\r\naction by the tendency of large numbers to rush to the support of the\r\nProhibitionists, because of their suffrage plank; and they believed that\r\nif women were determined to work for some political party, the\r\nRepublican at that time held out most hope. This aroused the antagonism\r\nof the Prohibitionists and Democrats, both men and women, and afforded\r\nthe strongest possible object lesson to Miss Anthony of the wisdom of\r\nhenceforth adhering to her policy of non-partisanship until one of the\r\n_dominant_ parties should declare unmistakably for woman suffrage and\r\nadvocate it by means of press and platform.\r\n\r\nIn August occurred the death of Sarah Pugh, the gentle Quaker and\r\nstaunch Abolitionist, her old and faithful friend. It was followed by\r\nthat of Frances D. Gage a few months later; and in December passed away\r\nthe true and helpful ally, William Henry Channing. Each left a void in\r\nher heart, and yet the memory of these great souls impelled to renewed\r\neffort. There was no cessation of the work on the History, which was\r\nslowly evolved through the heat of summer and the beautiful days of\r\nearly autumn, but by the end of October the funds were exhausted, the\r\nmoney left by Mrs. Eddy was still in litigation, and Miss Anthony again\r\nwent on the lecture platform, speaking almost every night through\r\nNovember and December.\r\n\r\nShe did not fail, however, to look carefully after the interests of the\r\nSeventeenth National Convention which met as usual in Washington,\r\nJanuary 20, 1885. A letter from Clarina Howard Nichols was sent to be\r\nread at this meeting, but the hand which penned it was stilled in death\r\nbefore it was received. Of all the pioneer workers with whom Miss\r\nAnthony had been associated in the early days so full of scorn, ridicule\r\nand abuse, Mrs. Nichols was among the nearest and dearest, a forceful\r\nspeaker and writer, a tender, loving woman. It was in this convention\r\nthat the resolution denouncing dogmas and creeds was introduced by Mrs.\r\nStanton, and caused much commotion and heated argument. Miss Anthony\r\nopposed it, saying:\r\n\r\n     I object to the words \"derived from Judaism.\" It does not matter\r\n     where the dogma came from. I was on the old Garrison platform, and\r\n     found long ago that the settling of any question of human rights by\r\n     people's interpretation of the Bible is utterly impossible. I hope\r\n     we shall not go back to that war. We all know what we want, and\r\n     that is the recognition of woman's perfect equality. We all admit\r\n     that such recognition never has been granted in the centuries of\r\n     the past; but for us to begin a discussion here as to who\r\n     established this injustice would be anything but profitable. Let\r\n     those who wish go back into their history, but I beg it shall not\r\n     be done on our platform.[24]\r\n\r\nThe public, which always longed for a sensation at these suffrage\r\nconventions and was disappointed if it did not come, seized upon this\r\nresolution, and press and pulpit made it a text. The following Sunday W.\r\nW. Patton, D. D., president of Howard University, preached in the\r\nCongregational church of Washington a sermon entitled, \"Woman and\r\nSkepticism.\" He took the ground that as soon as women depart from their\r\nnatural sphere they become skeptical if not immoral. He gave as examples\r\nHypatia, Madame Roland, Harriet Martineau, Frances Power Cobbe and\r\nGeorge Eliot! Then turning his attention to America he said that \"the\r\nrecent convention of woman suffragists gave evidence of atheism and\r\nimmorality,\" and that \"Victoria Woodhull was the representative of the\r\nmovement in this country\"[25]. And this when Mrs. Woodhull had not been\r\non the suffrage platform for thirteen years! Miss Anthony and Mrs.\r\nStanton occupied front seats and at the close of the sermon went\r\nforward, shook hands with the preacher and Miss Anthony remarked\r\nearnestly: \"Doctor, your mother, if you have one, should lay you across\r\nher knee and give you a good spanking for that sermon.\" \"O, no,\" said\r\nMrs. Stanton quickly, \"allow me to congratulate you. I have been trying\r\nfor years to make women understand that the worst enemy they have is in\r\nthe pulpit, and you have illustrated the truth of it.\" Then, while the\r\ngreat divine was trying to recover his breath, they walked out of the\r\nchurch. The nine days' commotion which this produced can be imagined\r\nbetter than described. After some reflection Miss Anthony regretted that\r\nshe should have been provoked into her remark, but Mrs. Stanton wrote:\r\n\"Don't worry a moment. The more I think about it, the better I like it,\r\nbecause it was the most contemptuous thing which could have been said.\r\nLike that shot at Lexington, it will go round the world.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 6, Thomas W. Palmer called up in the Senate the resolution\r\nfor a Sixteenth Amendment and supported it by that masterly speech which\r\never since has been one of the strongest suffrage campaign documents.\r\nAt the request of Miss Anthony thousands of copies were sent out under\r\nhis frank. She went from Washington to Boston to attend a meeting of the\r\nNational branch of the Massachusetts association, and soon afterwards,\r\non March 2, started for the New Orleans Exposition. She was warmly\r\nwelcomed by Mrs. Caroline E. Merrick, wife of Judge E. T. Merrick, at\r\nwhose lovely home she was entertained during part of her stay. It was\r\nher first visit to the Crescent City and she was soon deluged with\r\ninvitations to speak and received many charming tokens of the\r\njustly-famed southern hospitality.\r\n\r\nShe spoke before the Woman's Club in the hall of the Continental Guards,\r\nwith May Wright Sewall, representative from Indiana; gave seven\r\naddresses, in as many days, before schools and colleges and, by\r\ninvitation of the Press Association, spoke in Agricultural Hall at the\r\nexposition and visited the headquarters of the different papers. The\r\nnext day, by request of Commissioner Truman, she gave an address and\r\nheld a reception at the New York headquarters. Her last appearance was\r\nat Tulane Hall under the auspices of the teachers of the city schools.\r\nShe was everywhere beautifully received, although her doctrines were new\r\nand unpopular, and at the close of each meeting her audience crowded\r\nabout her with words of appreciation and cordiality. Miss Anthony here\r\nmet for the first time \"Catherine Cole,\" of the editorial staff, and\r\nMrs. Eliza J. Nicholson, owner and manager of the Picayune. The latter\r\npresented her with an Indian basket filled to overflowing with orange\r\nblossoms, and this tribute was paid in her paper:\r\n\r\n     THE APOSTLE OF WOMAN'S RIGHTS.--Miss Susan B. Anthony has made a\r\n     most favorable impression upon the New Orleans public, and has by\r\n     her gentleness and courtesy won many friends for herself and her\r\n     cause. She came here a total stranger, and recognized the fact that\r\n     there were many who did not approve of her or her doctrines. She\r\n     has been sincere, truly polite and simply womanly in all her\r\n     dealings with the southern people, and by these very qualities has\r\n     commanded the respectful esteem of all. Miss Anthony has not\r\n     striven to make herself \"solid\" with the people who give the best\r\n     dinners.... The workingwoman, the unfashionable woman, have been\r\n     made as heartily welcome as the leader of society; and for their\r\n     appreciation they have been repaid by the friendship and esteem of\r\n     one of the grandest old maids that ever lived.\r\n\r\nThe Times-Democrat and Daily States also gave full and favorable reports\r\nof her visit and lectures. The two weeks allowed for this holiday sped\r\nquickly away and Miss Anthony left for the North on March 20, laden with\r\nluncheon, flowers and many tokens of affection from the women of New\r\nOrleans. At Marshall, Tex., she dined with President and Mrs. Culver, of\r\nBishops' University, and reached St. Louis Sunday evening, where she was\r\nthe guest of her nephew, Arthur A. Mosher, and his wife. The next four\r\nor five weeks were spent in the lecture field at hard work, under the\r\nmanagement of the Slayton Bureau. In answer to her letter of regret at\r\nnot meeting Mrs. J. Ellen Foster at an Iowa convention, as she had\r\nrequested, Mrs. Foster wrote: \"I was sorry enough not to see you but I\r\ngave the people your message in the evening. Dear soul, how long you\r\nhave stood for the truth delivered unto you! God bless your words and\r\nworks. I do not see creeds and dogmas just as you see them, I do not\r\nbelieve in all that you do, but I believe in you!\"\r\n\r\nThe last of April came the long-expected summons to Boston to receive\r\nthe legacy of Mrs. Eddy, the courts having sustained the will. While\r\neastward bound, crossing the State of Illinois, newspapers were brought\r\non the train announcing the death of Grant, and she writes: \"The weather\r\nis lovely and springlike today, but how still and solemn it seems out\r\nhere on these broad prairies with that great general gone forever!\" The\r\ncase had been in litigation three years, Benjamin F. Butler appearing\r\nfor Miss Anthony and Lucy Stone. His fees were very reasonable but\r\nseveral thousand dollars were swallowed up in the suit. The legacy, in\r\nfirst-class securities, stocks, bonds, etc., was paid April 27, each\r\nreceiving $24,125.[26] Miss Anthony gives an amusing account, in one of\r\nher letters, of the awful nightmare she had on board the sleeper going\r\nhome, when she dreamed that a woman was at the head of her berth\r\nstifling her while a man knelt in front, his hand cautiously creeping\r\ntoward the inside pocket where she had sewed the money and bonds. She\r\nawoke with a scream and did not go to sleep again.\r\n\r\nIf this bequest had been left to Miss Anthony for her own personal use,\r\nshe could not have felt one-half the joy she now experienced in having\r\nthe means to carry on the work which always had been so seriously\r\nimpeded for lack of funds. Of course its receipt was heralded far and\r\nwide by the papers, and appeals began to pour in from all sides, nor\r\nwere they always appeals, but often demands. Scores of women considered\r\nthemselves entitled to a share because the money had been left to\r\nfurther the cause of woman. One wanted it to help lift a mortgage on her\r\nhome, others to educate their children, to pay a debt, to reward them\r\nfor the valuable services they had given to woman suffrage, to start a\r\npaper, to carry one already started, and so on without end. The men also\r\nwere willing to relieve her of a portion. \"I am terribly oppressed by it\r\nall,\" Miss Anthony writes, \"and nothing would make me happier than to\r\nrespond to every one, but my money would melt away in a month.\" It was\r\nludicrous and yet pitiful to see certain persons who had repudiated her\r\nin days gone by because she was too radical and too aggressive,\r\ndiscovering all at once how much they always had valued her and how\r\nanxious they had been for a long time to renew the old friendship--the\r\ncommon story, ancient as the world.\r\n\r\nThe one thing she was determined to do first of all was to complete the\r\nHistory of Woman Suffrage, upon which she and Mrs. Stanton had spent all\r\nthe days that could be spared for nearly ten years. The work had been\r\ndelayed by the many other demands upon their time, by their trips\r\nabroad, but more than all else by lack of money. The authors were to pay\r\nfor composition, stereotyping, the making of the plates for the\r\nengravings and the printing of the same; Fowler & Wells for the paper,\r\npress-work, binding and advertising. Miss Anthony and her co-workers\r\nwere to receive only 12-1/2 per cent. commission on the sales. It\r\nreadily may be seen that she did not go into this as a money-making\r\nscheme. Her only thought, her only desire, was to collect the facts in\r\nconnection with the movement to secure the rights of women, before they\r\nshould be scattered and lost, and to preserve and put them into shape\r\nfor reference.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the first two volumes she had used every dollar she had\r\nbeen able to earn and all she could obtain from generous friends, and\r\nthere were still large unpaid bills. Now, with plenty of money at her\r\ncommand, she bought out the rights of Fowler & Wells, and engaged\r\nCharles Mann, of Rochester, to print the third volume. Mrs. Stanton had\r\nreturned to Tenafly, and there Miss Anthony again sent all the trunks\r\nand boxes of precious documents. She completed her lecture engagements\r\nand the first of June, 1885, found the two women once more hard at work.\r\n\r\n\"I really think of you with pity these hot midsummer days,\" wrote Mrs.\r\nSewall to Mrs. Stanton, \"under the lash of blessed Susan's relentless\r\nenergy; but the reflection that she applies it with the most vigor to\r\nher own back enables one to regard that instrument, after all, with more\r\nadmiration than terror.\" It was indeed true that Mrs. Stanton's luxury\r\nand ease-loving nature required much urging,[27] and while Miss Anthony\r\ntook upon herself all the drudgery possible and all the financial\r\nanxiety and burden, she was compelled to keep Mrs. Stanton keyed up to\r\ndo a great portion of the literary work. \"It is the one drawback at\r\nevery turn,\" she writes, \"that I have not the faculty to frame easy,\r\npolished sentences. If I could but do this, I would finish up the\r\nHistory without asking aid of anyone.\" And again: \"It has been the bane\r\nof my life that I am powerless to put on paper the glimpses of thoughts\r\nwhich come and go like flashes of lightning.\" As has been said before in\r\nthese pages, she is a perfect critic and delightful letter-writer, but\r\nfinds difficulty in doing what is called \"literary work.\" Practice\r\nundoubtedly would have enabled her to overcome this, but she felt\r\nalways that her chief strength lay in executive ability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MISS ANTHONY AND MRS. STANTON.\r\n\r\nWRITING THE HISTORY OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE.]\r\n\r\nEarly in June Miss Anthony slipped away from the work long enough to go\r\nto the Progressive Friends' meeting at Kennett Square, Penn., where she\r\nwas the guest of Deborah Pennock and met, for the first time, Sarah J.\r\nEddy. In her diary she says: \"Last evening as I sat on the sofa Miss\r\nEddy put her arms around me and said, 'I am so glad I love you; I should\r\nhave felt very sorry if I had not.' And so should I, for the sake of her\r\ndear mother and grandfather, who had so much confidence in me.\" The two\r\nwent on to New York together and then over to Mrs. Stanton's for a\r\nlittle visit, and the friendship formed at that time has been maintained\r\never since. Later when Miss Eddy was going to Rochester to a convention,\r\nMiss Anthony wrote Mrs. Hallowell: \"I am sure you would be glad to\r\nentertain her; she is a sweet, lovely little woman; thoroughly\r\nsympathizing with everything and everybody that suffers injustice. I am\r\nvery sorry that sister Mary and I must be away and can not have the dear\r\ngirl with us.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony experienced a great disadvantage in being so far away from\r\nher publisher, the more especially as she had to send a chapter at a\r\ntime, read proofs of each as soon as it was set up, send back corrected\r\nproof, get the revises, etc., and she soon found it necessary to spend\r\nabout half her time in Rochester. The women who were preparing the\r\nchapters for their respective States delayed the work, neglecting to\r\nsend them when promised; many occupied twice as much space as had been\r\nassigned them and were highly indignant when Mrs. Stanton used the blue\r\npencil unsparingly on their productions. They vented their feelings on\r\nMiss Anthony, knowing that nothing they could say would ruffle Mrs.\r\nStanton's equipoise, and she writes in her diary: \"To decide between the\r\ntwo has almost torn me in twain. People who can write are so tenacious,\r\neach thinking her own style better than any other, while poor I don't\r\nknow which is the best.\"\r\n\r\nEvery few weeks she was obliged to rush over to Fayetteville to confer\r\nwith Mrs. Gage, who was industriously preparing her part of the work.\r\nUrgent appeals came from women in Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Kansas\r\nand Indiana that they could not possibly make a success of their State\r\nconventions unless she came to their assistance, but she steeled her\r\nheart against them and stuck closely to her task. From the lecture\r\nbureau came a list of ten engagements at $50 a night, but she refused\r\nthem. Some of the expressions in her letters of those busy days show the\r\nstate of her mind better than could volumes of description:\r\n\r\n     All the work of today put aside to grope into the old past. I feel\r\n     like rushing to you this very minute, but here Mrs. Stanton and I\r\n     are, scratching, scratching every hour, not each other's eyes but\r\n     the History papers. I am a fish out of water.... It makes me feel\r\n     growly all the time.... I can not get away from my ball and\r\n     chain.... I think we'll make things snap and crackle a little....\r\n     This is the biggest swamp I ever tried to wriggle through.... We'll\r\n     both put on our thinking caps and I guess get quite a lot of\r\n     funnies in the reminiscences.... Now here is the publisher's\r\n     screech for money.... O, to get out of this History prison!... I am\r\n     too tired to write--I mean too lazy.... No warhorse ever panted for\r\n     the rush of battle more than I for outside work. I love to make\r\n     history but hate to write it.\r\n\r\nOn November 12 Mrs. Stanton's seventieth birthday was celebrated by a\r\nlarge reception held in the parlors of Dr. Lozier in New York, where\r\nMrs. Stanton read a charming paper on \"The Pleasures of Old Age.\" Her\r\ndaughter, Harriot Stanton Blatch, sent the following bright and breezy\r\nmessage:\r\n\r\n     ... How I wish I could give my congratulations in the flesh!\r\n     Distance is the foe of love. Kiss dear Susan and let her kiss you\r\n     for me. On November 12 I shall think of you both, for you two are\r\n     not easily separated in my mind, and there will be a tenderness in\r\n     my thoughts and a thankfulness that you both have lived. In your\r\n     worries over the History, remember that at least one woman\r\n     appreciates the fact that her life has been made easier because of\r\n     your combined public work. You ought to be overflowing with\r\n     gratitude for each other's existence, for neither without the other\r\n     would have achieved the work you have accomplished. Every day of\r\n     your lives let your hearts praise the good fortune that brought you\r\n     together. Friendship is the grandest relation in the world, and I\r\n     feel infinitely blessed in having two such women as friends. You\r\n     and dear Susan are not yet to be sainted; you have no end of work\r\n     in you still, and must labor on for many a long year, and gain many\r\n     a triumphant victory. I throw up my cap and cry hurrah for you two\r\n     grand old warriors! The curl is from Nora's little head. She shall\r\n     be taught to reverence her Queen Mother and Maid of Honor Susan.\r\n     Now farewell, dear ladies; I am wishing you on birthdays and every\r\n     day a long and happy life.\r\n\r\nThe next morning came the cablegram announcing the sudden death in\r\nSwitzerland of the mother of Julia and Rachel Foster. Miss Anthony\r\ndropped all work when the sisters arrived at New York, went with them to\r\nPhiladelphia and rendered every possible consolation and assistance. But\r\nnot even to go to Washington to push the work in Congress and arrange\r\nfor the National Convention would she delay the task she was so anxious\r\nto finish. She wrote scores of letters, however, in regard to both, and\r\nthe congressmen particularly had reason to feel that she had not\r\nforgotten their promises. Her long and persistent labors were rewarded,\r\nfor the close of 1885 found the whole third volume of the History in the\r\nhands of the printers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] An official request was sent to the heads of the departments to\r\npermit the women employes to attend one session of this convention but\r\nit was refused. A few days later permission was given them to go to Mrs.\r\nMcElroy's reception at the White House, and the male employes were given\r\na half-holiday to attend the exercises on St. Patrick's Day.\r\n\r\n[20] The Methodist bishops Bowman, Warren, Newman, Haven, Turner and\r\nWalters have favored woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n[21] Signed by Maybury, Michigan; Poland, Vermont; Tucker, Virginia;\r\nHammond, Georgia; Culbertson, Texas; Moulton, Illinois; Broadhead,\r\nMissouri; Dorsheimer, New York; Collins, Massachusetts; Seney, Ohio;\r\nBisbee, Florida.\r\n\r\n[22] Miss Anthony's letters show how desirous she was that everybody who\r\nassisted at these conventions should have full measure of credit: \"They\r\nare earnest and anxious to do for woman's cause and I want them treated\r\nfairly and leniently as to all mistakes.\" Again she writes: \"Since\r\nOregon was never before represented in our conventions, her speakers\r\nmust have more room in the report than we old stagers.\"\r\n\r\n[23] When Miss Anthony learned that this action had been taken with the\r\nsanction of Frances E. Willard, she pointed out to her in vigorous\r\nlanguage how the Prohibition-Republicans had left that party this year\r\nbecause a temperance resolution had failed in the platform committee and\r\nhad gone over to the Prohibition party, charging that the Republicans\r\nwere cowardly. Yet the very first act of this Prohibition convention, to\r\nwhich Miss Willard was a delegate, was to abandon the idea of National\r\nSupremacy and accept that of State Rights in order to conciliate the\r\nsouthern members. She further said: \"When the time comes in which it\r\nwill be political expediency for the Prohibition party to throw woman\r\nsuffrage overboard altogether, over it will go.\" Miss Willard lived to\r\nsee this prophecy fulfilled at the National Prohibition Convention of\r\n1896.\r\n\r\n[24] Apropos of this discussion, an amusing anecdote is related of Miss\r\nAnthony. When confronted, in an argument, with the passage of scripture,\r\n\"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands,\" etc., she replied:\r\n\"Gentlemen, no one objects to the husband being the head of the wife as\r\nChrist was the head of the church--to crucify himself; what we object to\r\nis his crucifying his wife.\"\r\n\r\n[25] This account of the sermon is taken from the reports of half a\r\ndozen reputable newspapers.\r\n\r\n[26] This is the only instance where a woman has bequeathed a large\r\namount of money to the cause of equal rights, although a number of small\r\nbequests have been made. Women have given millions of dollars to\r\nchurches, charities, and colleges for men but comparatively nothing to\r\nsecure freedom for those of their own sex.\r\n\r\n[27] In one of Miss Anthony's letters she relates with amusement that\r\nMr. Stanton had just come in and, seeing his wife lying on the couch,\r\nremarked, \"Ah, resting, I see.\" \"No,\" she replied, \"I am exercising by\r\nlying down.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nMANY TRIPS--FIRST VOTE ON SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT.\r\n\r\n1886-1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony started for Washington toward the last of January, 1886,\r\nwith a lighter heart than she had possessed for many years. The dreadful\r\nburden of the labor on the History was lifted, all the bills were paid,\r\nshe had given a helping hand to several of the old workers, which made\r\nher very happy, and she had one or two good dresses in her trunk. There\r\nwas nothing which the paragrapher who hated what Miss Anthony\r\nrepresented, liked so well as to make disagreeable flings at her\r\nclothes, and yet it is an indisputable fact of history that she was one\r\nof the most perfectly dressed women on the platform, although her tastes\r\nwere very plain and simple. A lady once wrote her asking if it would not\r\nbe possible to make the suffrage conventions a little more æsthetic,\r\nthey were so painfully practical. She sent the letter to Mrs. Stanton,\r\nwho commented: \"Well now, perhaps if we could paint injustice in\r\ndelicate tints set in a framework of poetical argument, we might more\r\neasily entrap the Senator Edmunds and Oscar Wilde types of Adam's sons.\r\nSuppose at our next convention all of us dress in pale green, have a\r\nfaint and subdued gaslight with pink shades, write our speeches in verse\r\nand chant them to a guitar accompaniment. Ah me! alas! how can we reform\r\nthe world æsthetically?\"\r\n\r\nThe members of Congress always knew when Miss Anthony had arrived in\r\nWashington. Other women accepted their word that they were going to do\r\nsomething, and waited patiently at home. Miss Anthony followed them up\r\nand saw that they did it. If she could not find them at the Capitol,\r\nshe went to their homes. If they promised to introduce a certain measure\r\non a certain day, she was in the gallery looking them squarely in the\r\nface. If they failed to do it, they found her waiting for them at the\r\nclose of the session. Senator Blair wrote this humorous note January 15:\r\n\"I thought just as likely as not you would come fussing round before I\r\ngot your amendment reported to the Senate. I wish you would go home.\r\nCockrell has agreed to let me know soon whether he won't allow the\r\nreport to be made right off without any bother, and I have been to him\r\nseveral times before. I don't see what you want to meddle for, anyway.\r\nGo off and get married!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"I hope you will live always in this world.\r\nHeaven has got more than it's share of good people already. Sincerely &\r\nRespectfully, Henry W. Blair.\"]\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony has been directly connected with every action taken by\r\nCongress or by any congressional committee on the question of woman\r\nsuffrage. There are on file among her papers hundreds of letters from\r\nmembers during the past thirty years, showing her energy and persistence\r\nin compelling attention to this subject, in learning who were its\r\nfriends, in attempting to convert the doubters and in spurring the\r\nbelievers to effort. This is something for the women of the future to\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nThe Eighteenth Annual Convention opened February 17. Prominent features\r\nwere a fine address by Rev. Rush R. Shippen, of All Souls church, and\r\nthe first appearance on the platform of Mary F. Eastman, Ada C. Sweet,\r\nthe pension agent, the eloquent southern speakers, Mrs. Elizabeth A.\r\nMeriwether and Mrs. Sallie Clay Bennett, and the talented German, Madame\r\nClara Neymann. Among many letters was one from George W. Childs to Miss\r\nAnthony, saying: \"I am always glad to hear from you and I keep track of\r\nyour continued good work. Do not be discouraged. I take pleasure in\r\nsending the enclosed check ($100) with my sincere regards and very best\r\nwishes.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowds were so great that policemen had to be stationed at the door\r\nto prevent late comers from trying to enter during the evening sessions.\r\nThe resolutions scored the bill before Congress proposing to\r\ndisfranchise all Utah women, both Gentile and Mormon, to punish the\r\ncrime of polygamy. The usual hearing was granted before the\r\ncongressional committees. The fight for woman suffrage in the\r\nForty-ninth Congress was conducted by Ezra B. Taylor, of Ohio, who\r\nprepared the favorable minority report of the House Judiciary Committee.\r\nThe adverse majority report was signed by John Randolph Tucker, of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nOn March 25 \"the general\" slipped up to New York City, to assist her\r\nforces at the State convention, and then hastened back to Washington to\r\ndirect the main line of attack. The diary says:\r\n\r\n     March 30.--Went to House of Representatives, saw Messrs. Tucker and\r\n     Taylor of judiciary committee; both promised to report soon. Then\r\n     went to Senate, saw Messrs. Blair, Stanford and Bowen; all agreed\r\n     to work to bring up our bill by May 1. In the evening took a cab\r\n     and went in a pouring rain to Senator Stanford's, where I spent an\r\n     hour. How keen and true are his perceptions in regard to public\r\n     questions!\r\n\r\n     March 31.--Pouring rain, dark and muggy. I went to the Senate; sat\r\n     with Mrs. Dolph and Mrs. Stanford; heard Senator Dolph's fine\r\n     speech on the admission of Washington Territory as a State and his\r\n     splendid word for woman suffrage. Mrs. Dolph took me home in her\r\n     carriage.\r\n\r\n     April 1.--Went to the Senate again to secure pledges for votes and\r\n     speeches for the Sixteenth Amendment Bill. Got Senator Dolph's\r\n     strongest paragraphs, and at 8 P. M. went to the top floor of the\r\n     Associated Press rooms and gave them to Mr. Boynton, who sent them\r\n     over the wires.\r\n\r\n     April 9.--The United States Senate today voted down Eustis' motion\r\n     to refuse to admit Washington Territory unless the woman suffrage\r\n     clause were eliminated from its constitution, 25 to 12. Senator\r\n     Ingalls was the only Republican who voted with the enemy.\r\n\r\nA few days later Miss Anthony received the following from Mrs. Caroline\r\nE. Merrick, of New Orleans: \"... I feel defrauded that I never knew you\r\nuntil last year. Judge Merrick says you are the most sensible person he\r\never met (without any sex qualifications, of course). Like you, I was\r\nindignant at Mr. Eustis in regard to his course toward Washington\r\nTerritory. I was ashamed and blushed for my Louisiana senator that time.\r\nThanks for your sympathy in my illness. When my head lies low I pray\r\nthat you may find another and even better friend in my State, who will\r\ncome to the front in the cause of equal rights for women.\" An extract\r\nfrom a letter of Rev. Olympia Brown to Mrs. Stanton shows how much the\r\nold workers as well as the young depended upon Miss Anthony: \"I wish to\r\ninquire what has become of Susan? You know she is my North Star. I take\r\nall my bearings from her, and when I lose sight of her I wander\r\nhelplessly, uncertain of my course.\"\r\n\r\nThe diary of April 30 says: \"Heard Phoebe Couzins had been taken to Hot\r\nSprings, terribly crippled with rheumatism. Wrote her at once and\r\nenclosed $100, telling her I wanted it used to provide delicacies and\r\nmake her comfortable. I have thought it would be Phoebe whom I should\r\ntake with me on my southern tour next year, but I fear her work is\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Caroline E. Merrick (Signed: \"I am thine ever faithfully\r\nand affectionately Caroline E. Merrick\")]\r\n\r\nBy the middle of May, 1886, the last bit of History proof was read, and\r\nunlimited leave of absence was granted Miss Anthony by her publisher,\r\nwhile the indexer and binder completed the work which was begun in 1876.\r\nOn the 19th she started for Kansas, stopping for the usual visit in\r\nChicago with her cousins. In Kansas she visited her brothers at\r\nLeavenworth and Fort Scott for nearly two months, making an\r\noccasional speech. On the morning of July 4, under the auspices of\r\nthe W. C. T. U., she addressed a large audience at Salina on, \"The\r\npowerlessness of woman so long as she is dependent on man for bread.\" In\r\nthe hot afternoon, as she was about to enjoy a nap, word came that a\r\nhundred people had united in a request that she should speak again, as\r\nthey had come from ten to twenty miles on purpose to hear her; so she\r\nreturned to the grove, and Mrs. Griffith, State evangelist, kindly\r\nyielded her hour. On July 11 Miss Anthony went again to Chicago, and on\r\nthe 14th spoke at Lake Bluff Camp Meeting, which was under the\r\nmanagement of Frances E. Willard. She then visited the summer homes of\r\nher cousins and of Elizabeth Boynton Harbert, at Lake Geneva. On this\r\ntrip she was accompanied by her dearly-loved niece, Susie B., who went\r\nwith her to Rochester and spent the summer. The diary briefly records:\r\n\r\n     September 28.--Left Chicago at noon and lunched with Miss Willard\r\n     at Rest Cottage, Evanston. Her mother bright and charming at\r\n     eighty-two, and Anna Gordon sweet as ever. It was very good to see\r\n     Miss Willard under her own roof. Reached Racine in time for the\r\n     State convention, was met by a delegation of ladies and taken to\r\n     the home of Martha Parker Dingee, niece of the great Theodore\r\n     Parker, a lovely woman. Fine audiences.\r\n\r\n     October 2.--Reached St. Louis at 8 A. M. As I was looking for my\r\n     trunk I heard some one cry out, \"Is that you, Susan?\" and there\r\n     were Phoebe Couzins and her father. I had made my trip that way for\r\n     the special purpose of seeing her, expecting to find her confined\r\n     to the house; so I went home and breakfasted with them.\r\n\r\n     October 4.--Reached Leavenworth and found Mrs. Colby and Mrs. Saxon\r\n     ready to begin the campaign for arousing public sentiment to demand\r\n     a bill from the next legislature to secure Municipal suffrage for\r\n     women. Dr. Ruth M. Wood is the mainspring of the movement here.\r\n\r\nThis series of conventions was held in the congressional districts from\r\nOctober 5 to November 3, Mrs. Laura M. Johns, manager, assisted by Mrs.\r\nAnna C. Wait, president of the State Association, and by a number of\r\ncapable and energetic Kansas women at each place visited. Under date of\r\nOctober 11, Miss Anthony wrote to eastern friends: \"We are having the\r\nloveliest weather you ever dreamed of and the most magnificent\r\naudiences--no church or hall holding them. If our legislators, State or\r\nnational, could only see these gatherings and look into the earnest\r\nfaces of these people, coming so many miles in wagons to see and hear\r\nand get fresh courage, they would surely answer our demands by something\r\nelse than silence.\" The press corroborated this description and the\r\nfollowing special dispatch may be taken as a fair specimen:\r\n\r\n     The seventh district convention, the third of the series, has just\r\n     closed in Lincoln, and was a beautiful ovation to Miss Anthony.\r\n     Crowded houses greeted her--every available foot of space filled\r\n     with chairs, window-sills utilized for seats, and conveyances drawn\r\n     up outside of windows and filled with listeners. People came\r\n     thirty, forty and fifty miles in buggies and wagons to shake hands\r\n     with the pioneer suffragist. Grizzly-headed opposers succumbed to\r\n     Miss Anthony's logic and came up to grasp her hand and say God\r\n     bless her, and proved the depth of their fervor by generous\r\n     financial aid to the cause she so ably represents. It is seldom\r\n     that the beginner of a great reform lives to see such fruitage of\r\n     her labors as does she. People often descant upon the indifference\r\n     of women to the question of their own enfranchisement and to\r\n     political matters generally; but there is serious doubt of greater\r\n     interest ever having been shown by men in political meetings than\r\n     women exhibit in these conventions....\r\n\r\n     On the evening of the second day the house was so densely packed\r\n     that a messenger for a glass of water had to go out through a\r\n     window. But in spite of all discomfort and the many standing, the\r\n     audience maintained perfect order and gave the utmost attention\r\n     throughout Miss Anthony's speech of two hours. Learning that she\r\n     would remain in Lincoln over Sunday the people importuned her to\r\n     speak that afternoon in the Presbyterian church, which she did to a\r\n     large audience.\r\n\r\nThe diary relates: \"A mother brought her four-weeks-old girl baby\r\ntwenty-five miles in a carriage, so she might tell it, when grown, that\r\nSusan B. Anthony had taken it in her arms. 'And the trip has not hurt\r\nbaby a particle,' she said brightly.\" And again it tells, with a good\r\ndeal of gusto, that one Baptist minister was determined the suffrage\r\nspeakers should not have his church and only yielded after several of\r\nthe richest pew-holders declared they never would pay another dollar\r\ntowards his salary if he did not. He then made his appearance at the\r\nmeeting, opened it with his blessing and closed it with his benediction!\r\nMiss Anthony was not always able to speak to her own satisfaction. At\r\nSalina she lectured for the Y. M. C. A. and writes: \"I went to the\r\nopera house and found a fine audience. Tried to give 'Moral Influence\r\nvs. Political Power,' but the spirit wouldn't soar; its wings flapped on\r\nthe earth perpetually for the whole hour. I took my $25 from the\r\ntreasurer and went home with a heavy heart. It is beyond my knowledge\r\nwhy, after speaking every day for a whole week, freely and decently, my\r\nwits should desert me and my tongue be tied just at the time when I am\r\nmost anxious to do my best.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days' meetings were held at Abilene, Florence, Hutchinson, Wichita,\r\nAnthony, Winfield, Independence, Lawrence and Fort Scott. The speakers\r\nwere entertained by prominent families, suffrage societies were formed\r\nat each place, the vast majority of public sentiment seemed favorable,\r\nand the collections paid all the expenses of the conventions.\r\n\r\nIn November and December a number of other speakers made a canvass of\r\nthe State, and the following winter the legislature passed a bill\r\nconferring Municipal suffrage upon the women of Kansas. The bill was\r\nintroduced in the Senate by R. W. Blue (Rep.) of Linn county; and in the\r\nHouse by T. T. Taylor (Rep.) of Reno county. It passed the Senate, 25\r\nayes, all Republicans; 13 noes, 10 Republicans and 3 Democrats; in the\r\nHouse 90 ayes, 84 Republicans and 6 Democrats; 21 noes, 5 Republicans\r\nand 16 Democrats. The bill was signed by Governor John A. Martin,\r\nFebruary 15, 1887; and under its provisions women in that State have\r\nvoted ever since at Municipal elections.[28]\r\n\r\nWithout a day's rest, Miss Anthony went direct from Kansas to Sandwich,\r\nIll., to attend the State convention. After three days there and a\r\nSunday in Chicago, Monday, November 8, found her at Racine, Wis., ready\r\nto begin a tour of conventions in every congressional district. That\r\nevening a reception was given her by Hon. and Mrs. M. B. Erskine, and\r\nthe hospitality of their handsome home was offered for every day which\r\nshe could spend in the city.\r\n\r\nWith Mrs. Colby and Rev. Olympia Brown, assisted by local speakers,\r\nmeetings were held at Waukesha, Ripon, Oshkosh, Green Bay, Grand Rapids,\r\nEau Claire, LaCrosse, Evansville, Milwaukee and Madison. At the last\r\nplace the ladies spoke in the Senate chamber of the State House to an\r\naudience containing a number of dignitaries, among them President\r\nBascom, of the State University, and his wife, who from this time were\r\nMiss Anthony's steadfast friends. Mrs. Colby gives a graphic description\r\nof Miss Anthony's sudden outburst here, when several members had\r\nexasperated her by their remarks, which closes: \"I was writing at the\r\nsecretary's desk and as I looked up I realized the full grandeur of the\r\nscene. It was woman standing at the bar of the nation, pleading for the\r\nrecognition of her citizenship. Miss Anthony seemed positively Titanic\r\nas she leaned far over from the speaker's desk. Her tone and manner were\r\nsuperb, and the vast and sympathetic audience caught the electric\r\nthrill....\" In this city she was the guest of an old schoolmate,\r\nElizabeth Ford Proudfit. The meetings closed December 3, and Miss\r\nAnthony wrote Mrs. Spofford:\r\n\r\n     I intend now to make straight for Washington without a stop. I\r\n     shall come both ragged and dirty. Think of two solid months of\r\n     conventions, speaking every night! Don't worry about me. I was\r\n     never better or more full of hope and good work. Though the apparel\r\n     will be tattered and torn, the mind, the essence of me, is sound to\r\n     the core. Please tell the little milliner to have a bonnet picked\r\n     out for me, and get a dressmaker who will patch me together so I\r\n     shall be presentable. Now for the Washington convention: Before\r\n     settling upon the Universalist church, you would better pocket the\r\n     insults and refusals of the Congregational church powers that be\r\n     and send your most lovely and winning girls to ask for that. If you\r\n     can't get it or the Metropolitan or the Foundry or the New York\r\n     Avenue or any large and popular church, why take the Universalist,\r\n     and then tell the saints of the fashionable churches that we dwell\r\n     there because they refused us admission to their holy sanctuaries.\r\n     Don't let us go into the heterodox houses, much as I love them,\r\n     except because we are driven away from the orthodox.\r\n\r\nIn December the third volume of the History of Woman Suffrage at last\r\nwas ready for the public, another book of nearly 1,000 pages. It\r\ncompleted the story up to 1884, and like its predecessors was cordially\r\nreceived by the press. The money swallowed up by this work hardly will\r\nbe credited. Mrs. Stanton not being able or willing to revise the last\r\nvolume until it was put into proof slips, and then making extensive\r\nchanges, the cost for re-setting type was over $900. The fifty fine\r\nsteel engravings and the prints made from them cost over $6,000. For\r\nproof reading $500 was paid, and for indexing, $250. Mrs. Stanton and\r\nMrs. Gage, seeing that there never would be any profits from the books\r\nand that Miss Anthony proposed to give most of them away, sold out their\r\nrights to her, the former for $2,000 and the latter for $1,000. She\r\nalso, as has been stated, bought out the interest of Fowler & Wells.\r\nWhen the first edition of the three mammoth volumes finally came into\r\nher sole possession, they represented an outlay on her part of $20,000.\r\n\r\nWhile there were many criticisms from certain quarters as to various\r\nerrors and so-called misstatements, and many threats to write a history\r\nwhich should be free from all imperfections, the fact remains that,\r\nalthough fifty years have passed since the inception of the great\r\nmovement to secure equal rights for women, there never has been another\r\nattempt to preserve the story. But for Miss Anthony's careful collecting\r\nand saving of newspaper accounts, manuscripts of speeches, published\r\nreports and the correspondence of half a century, her persistent and\r\ndetermined effort for ten years to have them put into readable shape,\r\nand Mrs. Stanton's fine ability to do it, the student never would have\r\nbeen able to trace the evolution of woman from a chattel in the eye of\r\nthe law to a citizen with legal and social rights very nearly equal to\r\nthose of man. While there is necessarily some repetition, so long a time\r\nelapsing between the writing of the different volumes, and perhaps a\r\nlittle prolixity, there is not a dull page in the whole work and the\r\nreader will find it difficult to reach a place where she is willing to\r\nstop. It contains a resumé of early conditions; the persecutions endured\r\nby the pioneers in the struggle for freedom; the progress in each\r\nseparate State, and in foreign countries; the action taken by different\r\nlegislatures and congresses; the grand arguments made for equal rights;\r\nthe position of woman in church and State. Into whatever library the\r\nstudent may go seeking information upon this question, it is to these\r\nvolumes he must look to find it in collected and connected form. If Miss\r\nAnthony had done no other work but to produce this History, she would\r\ndeserve a prominent place on the list of immortal names.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to put so high a price upon it, $15 a set in cloth and\r\n$19.50 in leather binding, as to make a large sale impossible. Miss\r\nAnthony did not undertake it as a money-making scheme, and when the\r\nreceipt of Mrs. Eddy's bequest enabled her to discharge all indebtedness\r\nconnected with it, she felt herself at liberty to use it as a most\r\nvaluable means of educating the people into an understanding of the\r\nbroad principle of equality of rights. At her own expense she placed the\r\nHistory in over 1,000 of the libraries of Europe and America, including\r\nthe British Museum, the university libraries of Oxford, Edinburgh,\r\nDublin, Paris, Berlin, Finland, Melbourne, Toronto, and many of the\r\nuniversity and public libraries of the United States. The members of the\r\nSenate and House Judiciary Committees in several Congresses were\r\npresented with sets, and there are hundreds of letters on file from\r\nprominent persons in England and this country acknowledging the receipt\r\nof the books.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Faithfully yours, H B Anthony\"]\r\n\r\nChapters might be made of commendatory letters received from officials,\r\nwriters, public workers and friends in private life. A few specimens\r\nmust suffice. A letter from Senator H. B. Anthony to his \"dear cousin,\"\r\nclosed by saying: \"The three volumes form a valuable history of the\r\nimportant enterprise in which you have borne so conspicuous and\r\nhonorable a part, and you have added to the reputation of the name that\r\nwe both bear.\"\r\n\r\nMary L. Booth, the gifted editor of Harper's Bazar, thus expressed her\r\nopinion of the work:\r\n\r\n     You and your colleagues have industriously placed on record a\r\n     copious mass of documentary evidence which will be of the utmost\r\n     value when the time arrives to sum up the final results. When this\r\n     era comes, you will be foremost among the band of heroic pioneers\r\n     who have endured discomfort, obloquy and privation of much that is\r\n     dear to women for the sake of those who will profit by your labors\r\n     while failing to recognize them. Posterity will do you this\r\n     justice, whether your contemporaries do or not; but indeed, it is\r\n     universally known to those with any knowledge of the facts, that\r\n     among all the champions of women, none has been more distinguished\r\n     for utter self-abnegation, single-heartedness and devotion to her\r\n     life-work than Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\n     As you know, I have always felt the deepest interest in the\r\n     elevation of women, which is synonymous with that of humanity, for\r\n     man must be always on the plane of his wife, sister and mother....\r\n     The antagonism to political equality is rapidly disappearing, as it\r\n     is beginning to be recognized that in politics, as in everything\r\n     else, woman's help is needed, and the republic can not afford to\r\n     have her stand aloof. But this phase of the subject has been so\r\n     much misunderstood, both by men and women, that time is needed to\r\n     clear away the mists of misconception which envelop it; and to\r\n     prove that the co-operation of women in political life is not only\r\n     just and expedient, but absolutely indispensable to the public\r\n     weal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"I am now and always, Yours faithfully, Mary\r\nL. Booth\"]\r\n\r\nNo family in Rochester stood more steadfastly by Miss Anthony during all\r\nher long and eventful life than the Wilders--Carter, Samuel, Mrs. Maria\r\nWilder Depuy and D. Webster. The last, in acknowledging the receipt of\r\nthe books, wrote: \"How much you have contributed to history in this\r\ngrand publication! With woman as a part of humanity, what a revolution\r\nwill be wrought! Changes everywhere--in social life, in morals,\r\npolitics, business--and all for the better. In this world-revolution you\r\nhave done a great work. My children are proud of the fact that you are\r\nmy personal friend. I fully appreciate your gift. It will be a Bible in\r\nmy home.\" From the philanthropist, Sarah B. Cooper, revered for her work\r\nin the kindergartens on the Pacific coast, came this tribute:\r\n\r\n     This book is the fruitage of all the years of your faith and work.\r\n     It tells of the long preparation--the opening up of the forest; the\r\n     blazing of the trail; the clearing of the underbrush; the deep\r\n     sub-soiling; the lying fallow; the ploughing, sowing, harrowing,\r\n     the patient tillage--and now comes the harvest. What courage,\r\n     endurance, fidelity and faith! The pioneers of new thoughts and\r\n     principles are the loneliest of mortals. Those who live ahead of\r\n     their time must wait for the honors and plaudits of posterity to\r\n     get their full meed of appreciation and reward. But after all,\r\n     dear, honored friend, the richest reward of such a life as yours is\r\n     _to have lived it_.\r\n\r\nThe History also was given to the libraries of those towns whose women\r\nwould raise a certain amount towards various State suffrage campaigns,\r\nand in every possible way it always has been used for missionary\r\nwork.[29]\r\n\r\nThe first week in 1887, in most inclement weather and against the\r\nprotest of friends, Miss Anthony went all the way to Nebraska, to keep a\r\npromise to Mrs. Colby and other women of that State to attend their\r\nannual convention, January 7. She found a pleasant letter awaiting her\r\nat Lincoln, from her old friend, Mary Rogers Kimball, daughter of the\r\nnoted Abolitionist, Nathaniel P. Rogers, and wife of the General\r\nPassenger Agent of the Union Pacific R. R., now living at Omaha, which\r\nclosed: \"How I wish you could come to us and rest a few days. Mr.\r\nKimball would welcome you, as would every one of this household. You\r\nought to make our home happy by coming once in a while.... Mother, who\r\nis able to walk a little and is interested in all you do and say, sends\r\nher love and hopes to see you.\" She spoke at Chicago, January 13, in the\r\nFirst Methodist church, where she was introduced by the well-known Rev.\r\nH. W. Thomas.[30] She went from there to the Michigan convention at\r\nLansing, January 14, and here was presented to the audience by Governor\r\nCyrus G. Luce.\r\n\r\nShe reached Washington January 17, 1887, and rushed the preparations for\r\nthe Nineteenth National Convention, which opened on the 25th at the\r\nMetropolitan M. E. church. Zerelda G. Wallace gave a noteworthy address;\r\nSenator Carey, of Wyoming, made an able speech and Mrs. Carey sat by\r\nMiss Anthony during the proceedings. The second day of the convention,\r\nJanuary 26, marked a great epoch, the first vote ever taken in Congress\r\non a Sixteenth Amendment. The previous month, December 8, 1886, Henry W.\r\nBlair had asked the Senate to consider the following joint resolution:\r\n\"The rights of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied\r\nor abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.\" He\r\nsupported this in a long and comprehensive speech covering the whole\r\nground on which the demand is based, quoting from the favorable reports\r\nof the judiciary committees, exposing the weakness and fallacy of the\r\nobjections, and making an unanswerable argument on the justice of\r\ngranting political liberty to women.\r\n\r\nAt the urgent request of opposing senators the matter had been postponed\r\nuntil January 25, when it was again called up by Mr. Blair. The\r\nopposition was led by Joseph A. Brown, of Georgia, who described in\r\ndetail the intentions of the Creator when he made woman, and declared\r\nthat females had not the physical strength to perform military duty,\r\nbuild railroads, raise crops, sit on juries or attend night caucuses,\r\nbut that God had endowed men with strength and faculties for all these\r\nthings. He stated that it was a grave mistake to say that woman is taxed\r\nwithout being represented, and added, \"It is very doubtful whether the\r\nmale or the female sex has more influence in the administration of the\r\naffairs of government and the enactment of laws!\" He asserted that \"the\r\nbaser class of females would rush to the polls, and this would compel\r\nthe intelligent, virtuous and refined females, including wives and\r\nmothers, to relinquish for a time their God-given trust and go, contrary\r\nto their wishes, to the polls and vote to counteract the other class;\"\r\nand followed this by saying that \"the ignorant female voters would be at\r\nthe polls en masse, while the refined and educated, shrinking from\r\npublic contact, would remain at home.\" He continued: \"The ballot will\r\nnot protect females against the tyranny of bad husbands, as the latter\r\nwill compel them to vote as they dictate;\" then in the next breath he\r\ndeclared: \"Wives will form political alliances antagonistic to the\r\nhusbands, and the result will be discord and divorce.\" In his entire\r\nspeech Senator Brown ignored the existence of unmarried women and\r\nwidows. He closed with copious extracts from \"Letters from a Chimney\r\nCorner,\" written by some Chicago woman.\r\n\r\nSenator Dolph, of Oregon, followed in a clear, concise argument,\r\nbrushing away these sophistries by showing that such evils did not exist\r\nwhere women were enfranchised and voted at every election. He was\r\ninterrupted by Senator Eustis, of Louisiana, who inquired whether he\r\nthought \"it would be a decent spectacle to take a mother away from her\r\nnursing infant and lock her up all night with a jury?\" Senator Dolph\r\nreplied that there was not a judge in the world who would not excuse a\r\nwoman under such circumstances, just as there were many causes which\r\nexempted men. He continued:\r\n\r\n     Government is but organized society.... It can only derive its just\r\n     powers from the consent of the governed, and can be established\r\n     only under a fundamental law which is self-imposed. Every citizen\r\n     of suitable age and discretion has, in my judgment, a natural right\r\n     to participate in its formation. The fathers of the republic\r\n     enunciated the doctrine \"that all men are created equal; that they\r\n     are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.\" It\r\n     is strange that any one in this enlightened age should be found to\r\n     contend that this is true only of men, and that a man is endowed by\r\n     his Creator with inalienable rights not possessed by a woman. The\r\n     lamented Lincoln immortalized the expression that ours is a\r\n     government \"of the people, by the people, and for the people,\" and\r\n     yet in reality it is far from that. There can be no government by\r\n     the people where half of them are allowed no voice in its\r\n     organization and control.... God speed the day when not only in all\r\n     the States of the Union and in all the Territories, but everywhere,\r\n     woman shall stand before the law freed from the last shackle which\r\n     has been riveted upon her by tyranny, and the last disability which\r\n     has been imposed upon her by ignorance; not only in respect to the\r\n     right of suffrage, but in every other respect the peer and equal of\r\n     her brother, man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"J N Dolph\"]\r\n\r\nSenator Vest, of Missouri, came to the rescue of Senator Brown and in\r\nthe course of his speech said:\r\n\r\n     I pity the man who can consider any question affecting the\r\n     influence of woman, with the cold, dry logic of business. What man\r\n     can, without aversion, turn from the blessed memory of that dear\r\n     old grandmother, or the gentle words and caressing hand of that\r\n     blessed mother gone to the unknown world, to face in its stead the\r\n     idea of a female justice of the peace or township constable? For my\r\n     part, I want when I go to my home--when I turn from the arena where\r\n     man contends with man for what we call the prizes of this paltry\r\n     world--I want to go back, not to be received in the masculine\r\n     embrace of some female ward politician, but to the earnest, loving\r\n     look and touch of a true woman. I want to go back to the\r\n     jurisdiction of the wife, the mother; and instead of a lecture upon\r\n     finance or the tariff, or upon the construction of the\r\n     Constitution, I want those blessed, loving details of domestic life\r\n     and domestic love.\r\n\r\n     I have said I would not speak of the inconveniences to arise from\r\n     woman suffrage. I care not whether the mother is called upon to\r\n     decide as a juryman, or a jurywoman, rights of property or rights\r\n     of life, whilst her baby is \"mewling and puking\" in solitary\r\n     confinement at home. There are other considerations more important,\r\n     and one of them to my mind is insuperable. I speak now respecting\r\n     women as a sex. I believe that they are better than men, but I do\r\n     not believe they are adapted to the political work of this world. I\r\n     do not believe that the Great Intelligence ever intended them to\r\n     invade the sphere of work given to men, tearing down and destroying\r\n     all the best influences for which God has intended them. The great\r\n     evil in this country today is emotional suffrage. Women are\r\n     essentially emotional. What we want in this country is to avoid\r\n     emotional suffrage, and what we need is to put more logic into\r\n     public affairs and less feeling.[31]\r\n\r\nHe presented a remonstrance against giving the ballot to women, signed\r\nby nearly 200 New England men, headed by President Eliot, of Harvard\r\nUniversity, and including nearly fifty names prefixed by \"Rev.\" He next\r\ndrew from his budget a letter from Clara T. Leonard, of Boston, praying\r\nthat the suffrage should not be granted to women, and Mr. Hoar remarked\r\nthat the lady herself had been holding public office for a number of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nContinuing Senator Vest said: \"If we are to tear down all the blessed\r\ntraditions, if we are to desolate our homes and firesides, if we are to\r\nunsex our mothers, wives and sisters, and turn our blessed temples of\r\ndomestic peace into ward political assembly rooms, pass this joint\r\nresolution!\" He now produced a document, entitled \"The Law of Woman\r\nLife,\" and said: \"This is signed Adeline D. T. Whitney--I can not say\r\nwhether she be wife or mother. It contains not one impure or\r\nunintellectual aspiration. Would to God that I knew her so I could thank\r\nher in behalf of the society and politics of the United States. I shall\r\nask that it be printed, as my strength does not suffice for me to read\r\nit.\"[32] It proved to be a long and involved essay begging that the\r\nballot should not be given to women, and saying: \"Are the daughters and\r\ngranddaughters about to leap the fence, leave their own realm little\r\ncared for, undertake the whole scheme of outside creation, or contest it\r\nwith the men? Then God help the men! God save the commonwealth!\" Mr.\r\nVest concluded with a blood-curdling picture of the French Revolution\r\nwhich would be repeated in this country if women were enfranchised.\r\n\r\nSenator Blair then offered the appeal of the W. C. T. U. for the ballot,\r\nrepresenting over 200,000 women, presented by Zerelda G. Wallace, who\r\nhad reared thirteen children and grandchildren, among them the author\r\nof Ben Hur. He submitted also the matchless arguments which had been\r\nmade by the most intellectual women of the nation before the\r\ncongressional committees from year to year, including that of Miss\r\nAnthony in 1880, and urged that the question should be submitted to the\r\nlegislatures of the various States for settlement.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken on the question of submitting a Sixteenth Amendment\r\nto the Constitution to the State legislatures for ratification, and\r\nresulted in 16 yeas and 34 nays, 26 absent.[33] Of the affirmative\r\nvotes, all were Republican; of the negative, 24 Democratic and 10\r\nRepublican. Senator Farwell, of Illinois, was roundly denounced by the\r\nChicago Tribune for his affirmative vote. Senators Chace, Dawes and\r\nStanford, who were paired, and Plumb, who was absent, announced publicly\r\nthat they would have voted \"aye.\"\r\n\r\nOver fifty of the distinguished women in attendance at the convention\r\nwere in the Senate gallery during this debate. The most sanguine of them\r\nhad not expected the necessary two-thirds, but had worked to obtain a\r\nvote simply for the prestige of a discussion in the Senate, the printing\r\nof the speeches in the Congressional Record and the wide agitation of\r\nthe question through the medium of press and platform which was sure to\r\nfollow. They felt especially incensed at Senator Ingalls, as the\r\nsentiment of his State had just shown itself to be overwhelmingly in\r\nfavor of woman suffrage, and they did not hesitate to score him in\r\npublic and in private. As soon as the news of the vote reached the\r\nconvention Miss Anthony roundly denounced him from the platform. In the\r\nevening she received a note from him saying: \"Will you do me the favor\r\nto designate an hour at which it would be convenient for you to give me\r\na brief interview?\" She did not answer, and on the 31st she received\r\nanother: \"I called Thursday and Friday mornings, but was not able to\r\nreach you with my card. My errand was personal and I hope I may be more\r\nfortunate when you are again in the city.\" When she did see him she\r\nfound his purpose was to declare a truce, which she declined, as he\r\nalready had done the cause all the harm possible for him.\r\n\r\nFrom Washington Miss Anthony went to assist at a convention in\r\nPhiladelphia, and \"felt guilty for days,\" she says in her diary, because\r\nshe refused to go on to Connecticut. She enjoyed a brief visit with\r\nProfessor Maria Mitchell at Vassar College; and hastened to Albany to\r\naddress the legislature in regard to the Constitutional Convention,\r\n\"just as I did twenty years ago in the old Capitol,\" she writes. Then\r\nback to Washington to look after matters there, and thus on and on,\r\nnever allowing herself to be delayed by weather, fatigue or social\r\ndemands, month after month, year after year, with but one object in\r\nview, never losing sight of it for a moment, and making all else\r\nsubservient to this single purpose.\r\n\r\nIn April she was terribly distressed at the malicious falsehoods which\r\nwere sent out from Leavenworth in regard to the first voting of the\r\nwomen in Kansas, and says, \"It will take oceans of breath and ink to\r\ncounteract the baneful effects.\" On May 11, 1887, Frances E. Willard\r\nwrote her: \"Will you please send me the form of resolution which would\r\nbe the least that would satisfy you as a plank in the platform of the\r\nProhibition party, or as a resolution to be adopted by the W. C. T. U.?\r\nI write this without authorization from any quarter, simply because I\r\nwould like to find out what is the angle of vision along which you are\r\nlooking.\" To this Miss Anthony replied:\r\n\r\n     What is the full significance of \"would satisfy you?\" Do you mean\r\n     so satisfy me that I would work, and recommend all women to work,\r\n     for the success of the Third party ticket? Or do you mean the least\r\n     that I think it should say for its own sake? If the first, I am not\r\n     sure that the fullest endorsement would cause me to throw all my\r\n     sympathies and efforts into line with the Prohibition party, any\r\n     more than if the same full suffrage plank should be put into the\r\n     platform of the great Labor or Fourth party, which is pretty sure\r\n     to take part in the presidential contest of 1888.\r\n\r\n     I can not answer for others, but I shall not pray or speak or work\r\n     for the defeat of the nominees of the party of which every United\r\n     States Senator who voted for us last winter is a leading member,\r\n     and to which belongs every man but six in the Kansas Legislature\r\n     who made the overwhelming vote giving municipal suffrage to the\r\n     women of that State. Not until a third party gets into power or is\r\n     likely to do so, which promises a larger per cent. of\r\n     representatives on the floor of Congress and in the several State\r\n     legislatures who will speak and vote for woman's enfranchisement,\r\n     than does the Republican, shall I work for it. You see, as yet\r\n     there is not a single Prohibitionist in Congress, while there are\r\n     at least twenty Republicans on the floor of the United States\r\n     Senate, besides fully one-half of the members of the House of\r\n     Representatives, who are in favor of woman suffrage. For the women\r\n     of Kansas or Iowa to work for any third party would be ungrateful\r\n     and suicidal.\r\n\r\n     Since I hope to live to see a Sixteenth Amendment Bill through\r\n     Congress and three-fourths of the State legislatures, I do not\r\n     propose to work for the defeat of the party which thus far has\r\n     furnished nearly every vote in that direction. If you will pardon\r\n     me, I think it will be quite as suicidal a policy for the\r\n     temperance women of the nation to work to defeat the party which\r\n     contains so nearly all of their best friends and helpers. What it\r\n     seems to me should be done by all women who want reforms in\r\n     legislation, is to appoint committees to confer with leading\r\n     Republicans asking them to make pledges in the direction of\r\n     suffrage and temperance, with the assurance of our support in case\r\n     of the insertion of the planks we ask in their platform. I fear,\r\n     however, you are already pledged to the Third party, come what may,\r\n     and if so it is of no use for me to advise.[34]\r\n\r\nIn May Miss Anthony again journeyed westward, though she says in her\r\ndiary: \"It never was harder for me to start. A heavy nothingness is upon\r\nhead and heart.\" She went first to the State Suffrage Convention at\r\nIndianapolis, where as usual she was a guest in the beautiful home of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Sewall. A reception was given her at the Bates House and\r\nshe was cordially greeted by several hundred ladies. She went to\r\nmeetings at Evansville, Richmond and Lafayette, and then to the Ohio\r\nconvention at Cleveland; here, as always, the guest of her loved friend,\r\nLouisa Southworth.\r\n\r\nShe writes May 26: \"Arrived home at 8 P. M. and found all well--the all\r\nconsisting of sister Mary, the only one left.\" She was invited to meet\r\nwith a large and conservative society of women who did not believe in\r\nequal suffrage. All made nice little addresses and when Miss Anthony was\r\ncalled on she said: \"Ladies, you have been doing here today what I and\r\na few other women were denounced as 'unsexed' for doing thirty years\r\nago--speaking in public;\" and then proceeded to point the moral. She\r\nattended the commencement exercises of a young ladies' seminary, whose\r\nprincipal would not acknowledge a handsome gift from her pupils by a few\r\nremarks because she \"considered it would look too strong-minded.\" Miss\r\nAnthony comments on the graduates' essays: \"They had as much originality\r\nas Baedecker's Guide-book.\"\r\n\r\nIn July she went as the guest of her friend Adeline Thomson, of\r\nPhiladelphia, for two weeks at Cape May and here had her first\r\nexperience in sea-bathing, although she always had lived within a short\r\ndistance of the ocean. She says: \"This is my first seaside dissipation.\r\nIt seems very odd to be one of the giddy summer resort people!\" She took\r\nMiss Thomson with her up into the Berkshire hills of northwestern\r\nMassachusetts to Adams, her birthplace, and visited the home of her\r\ngrandfather. In the early days of her peregrinations she used to come\r\noften to this picturesque spot, but it now had been twenty years since\r\nher last visit. Time does not bring many changes to the New England\r\nnooks or the people who live in them, and she greatly enjoyed the nine\r\ndays spent with uncles, aunts and cousins, exploring the well-remembered\r\nspots. They went from here to Magnolia for a two weeks' visit at the\r\nseaside cottage of Mr. and Mrs. James Purinton, of Lynn, Mass. At this\r\ntime, in answer to a request for advice, Miss Anthony wrote to Olympia\r\nBrown and Mrs. Almedia Gray, of Wisconsin:\r\n\r\n     I have your letters relative to bringing suits under the school\r\n     suffrage law, and hasten to say to you that Mrs. Minor's and my own\r\n     experience in both suing and being sued on the Fourteenth Amendment\r\n     claim leads me to beseech you not to make a test case unless you\r\n     _know_ you will get the broadest decision upon it. If you get the\r\n     narrow one restricting the present law simply to school-district\r\n     voting, there it will rest and no judge or inspector will transcend\r\n     the limit of the decision. My judgment would be to say and do\r\n     nothing about the law, but through the year keep up the educational\r\n     work, showing that such and such cities allowed women to vote for\r\n     mayor, common council, etc., and by the next election many others\r\n     will let women vote; and so in a few years all will follow suit.\r\n     Let what you have alone and try for more; for all your legislature\r\n     has power to give. It will be vastly more likely to grant municipal\r\n     suffrage than your supreme court will be to give a decision that\r\n     the school law already allows women to vote for mayor, council,\r\n     governor, etc.\r\n\r\nThey thought best, however, to bring the suits; the exact results which\r\nwere predicted followed, and the school suffrage even was restricted\r\nuntil it was practically worthless.\r\n\r\nDuring this summer Miss Anthony undertook to arrange her many years'\r\naccumulation of letters, clippings, etc., and knowing her reluctance\r\never to destroy a single scrap, Mrs. Stanton wrote from Paris: \"I am\r\nglad to hear that you have at last settled down to look over those awful\r\npapers. It is well I am not with you. I fear we should fight every\r\nblessed minute over the destruction of Tom, Dick and Harry's epistles.\r\nUnless Mary, on the sly, sticks them in the stove when your back is\r\nturned, you will never diminish the pile during your mortal life. (Make\r\nthe most of my hint, dear Mary.)\" It is safe to say it was just as large\r\nat the end of the examination as at the beginning.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1887, Miss Anthony again made a circuit of conventions in\r\nevery congressional district in Wisconsin and then turned her attention\r\nto Kansas. The officers of the State association had arranged a series\r\nof conventions for the purpose of demanding a constitutional amendment\r\nconferring _full_ suffrage on women. Miss Anthony, with Mrs. Johns, Mrs.\r\nLetitia V. Watkins, State organizer, Rev. Anna Shaw and Rachel Foster,\r\ngave the month of October to this canvass. Senator Ingalls, in a speech\r\nat Abilene, had attempted to defend his vote in the Senate against the\r\nSixteenth Amendment, and Miss Anthony took this as a text for the\r\ncampaign. She had ample material for the excoriating which she gave him\r\nin every district in Kansas, as the Senator had declared: 1st, that\r\nsuffrage was neither a natural nor a constitutional right, but a\r\nprivilege conferred by the State; 2d, that no citizens should be allowed\r\nto participate in the formation of legislatures or the enactment of\r\nlaws, who could not enforce their action at the point of a bayonet; 3d,\r\nthat no immigrants should be allowed to enter the United States from any\r\ncountry on earth for the next twenty-five years; 4th, that negro\r\nsuffrage had been an absolute and unqualified failure; 5th, that while\r\nthere were thousands of women vastly more competent than men to vote\r\nupon questions of morality, they never should be allowed to do\r\nso--simply because they were women.\r\n\r\nIt hardly need be said that Miss Anthony found little difficulty in\r\nreducing to tatters these so-called arguments, and that her audiences\r\nwere in hearty sympathy. To borrow her own expression, she \"tried to use\r\nhim up so there was not an inch of ground under his feet.\" When the\r\nconvention was held at Atchison Mrs. Ingalls invited sixteen of the\r\nladies to a handsome luncheon, where the senator placed Miss Anthony at\r\nhis right hand and made her the guest of honor. She proposed that he\r\ndebate the question of woman suffrage with her but he refused on the\r\nground that he could not attack a woman, so she served up this objection\r\nin her speech that evening. To a reporter he is said to have given the\r\nreason that he \"would not stoop to the intellectual level of a woman.\"\r\n\r\nThe month of November was given to holding a two days' convention in\r\neach of the thirteen congressional districts of Indiana. These meetings\r\nwere arranged by the State secretary, Mrs. Ida H. Harper, and the strong\r\nforce of speakers, Miss Anthony, Mrs. Wallace, Mrs. Sewall and Mrs.\r\nGougar, aroused great enthusiasm and made many converts.[35] This ended\r\nthree months of constant travelling and speaking almost every day and\r\nevening. On the first of December Miss Anthony writes: \"I have laid me\r\ndown to sleep in a new bed nearly every night of this entire time.\"\r\n\r\nBut the 10th found her in Washington fresh and vigorous for the work of\r\nthe coming winter. She was anxious to know whether the reports of the\r\nSenate debate had been franked and sent out as promised and, to her\r\ninquiry, Senator Blair answered with his usual little joke: \"I have had\r\nthe speeches, etc., attended to and trust that the mails will do you\r\njustice if the males do not. But remember that men naturally fight for\r\ntheir lives, and on the same principle, you shall for yours!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28] Miss Anthony notes in her diary that she made her first Kansas\r\ncampaign in '67 and the suffrage bill was signed on her sixty-seventh\r\nbirthday. She received a letter of congratulation on the signing of the\r\nbill from Chief-Justice Horton, of Kansas.\r\n\r\n[29] The total amount received from sales has been only $7,000. Now,\r\nhowever, in order to give the History the widest possible circulation,\r\nthe price has been so reduced as to enable it to be placed in the hands\r\nof the reading public. It is the hope of Miss Anthony to publish the\r\nfourth volume in the year 1900, bringing the History up to that date.\r\n\r\n[30] At this meeting a yellow dog came on the platform and Miss Anthony\r\nis quoted as afterwards making this apt comment: \"She says that, at\r\nleast where women are concerned, the reporters are sure to seize upon\r\nsome triviality and ring its changes to the exclusion of serious\r\nmatters. She mentioned that when she spoke in Chicago last a dog ran\r\nacross the stage and, springing up, laid his nose on her shoulder. 'I\r\nprophesied to the audience then,' she continued, 'that the dog would\r\nfigure in the press reports more conspicuously than anything that was\r\nsaid or done, and so he did. He occupied half of the space in nearly\r\nevery paper.'\"\r\n\r\n[31] Both Senator Vest and Senator Brown had appealed wholly to the\r\nemotions in their speeches upon this question, which were overflowing\r\nwith sentiment and \"gush.\"\r\n\r\n[32] This hardly corresponds with Senator Brown's glowing description of\r\nthe physical strength conferred by the Creator on man so that he could\r\ndo the voting for the family.\r\n\r\n[33] _Yeas_: Blair, Bowen, Cheney, Conger, Cullom, Dolph, Farwell, Hoar,\r\nManderson, Mitchell of Oregon, Mitchell of Pennsylvania, Palmer, Platt,\r\nSherman, Teller, Wilson of Iowa. _Nays_: Beck, Berry, Blackburn, Brown,\r\nCall, Cockrell, Coke, Colquitt, Eustis, Evarts, George, Gray, Hampton,\r\nHarris, Hawley, Ingalls, Jones of Nevada, McMillan, McPherson, Mahone,\r\nMorgan, Morrill, Payne, Pugh, Saulsbury, Sawyer, Sewell, Spooner, Vance,\r\nVest, Walthall, Whitthorne, Williams, Wilson of Maryland. _Absent_:\r\nAldrich, Allison, Butler, Frye, Gibson, Gorman, Miller, Plumb, Ransom,\r\nCamden, Cameron, Chace, Dawes, Edmunds, Fair, Hale, Harrison, Jones of\r\nArkansas, Jones of Florida, Kenna, Maxey, Riddleberger, Sabin, Stanford,\r\nVan Wyck, Voorhees.\r\n\r\n[34] The skeptical can not but wonder whether the Republican party ever\r\nwill have the grace and wisdom to justify the confidence which Miss\r\nAnthony has steadfastly placed in it, as regards this question, from the\r\nday of its birth.\r\n\r\n[35] Conventions were held at Evansville, Vincennes, Bloomington,\r\nKokomo, Logansport, Wabash, Lafayette, South Bend, Fort Wayne, Muncie,\r\nAnderson, Madison and New Albany. The largest of the series was at Terre\r\nHaute, where the opera house, donated by the citizens, was crowded both\r\nevenings with an audience representing the culture and intelligence of\r\nthe city, and the convention was welcomed by the mayor, Jacob C.\r\nKolsom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nUNION OF ASSOCIATIONS--INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL.\r\n\r\n1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nA preceding chapter described the forming in 1869 of the American Woman\r\nSuffrage Association at Cleveland, O., the overtures for union by the\r\nNational Association the next year, and their rejection. No further\r\nefforts were made and each body continued to work in its own way. At the\r\nannual meeting of the American Association in Philadelphia, October 31,\r\n1887, the following resolution from the business committee was\r\nunanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The woman suffragists of the United States were all united\r\n     until 1868 in the American Equal Rights Association; and _whereas_,\r\n     The causes of the subsequent separation into the National and\r\n     American Woman Suffrage Societies have since been largely removed\r\n     by the adoption of common principles and methods; therefore\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That Mrs. Lucy Stone be appointed a committee of one\r\n     from the American Woman Suffrage Association to confer with Miss\r\n     Susan B. Anthony of the National and, if on conference it seems\r\n     desirable, that she be authorized and empowered to appoint a\r\n     committee of this association to meet a similar committee appointed\r\n     by the National to consider a satisfactory basis of union, and\r\n     refer it back to the executive committee of both associations for\r\n     final action.\r\n\r\n                                      HENRY B. BLACKWELL,\r\n\r\n                                 _Corresponding Secretary, A. W. S. A_.\r\n\r\nAfter conferring with the officers of the National Association, Miss\r\nAnthony informed Mrs. Stone that she would meet her in Philadelphia any\r\ntime until December 9, and after that in Washington. She replied that\r\nshe was not able to travel even so far as Philadelphia and, after some\r\ncorrespondence, Miss Anthony agreed to go to Boston. On the afternoon\r\nof December 21, 1887, accompanied by Rachel Foster, corresponding\r\nsecretary of the National, she met Mrs. Stone and Alice Stone Blackwell,\r\nat No. 3 Park street, Boston, and held an extended conference in regard\r\nto the proposed union. Two days later Mrs. Stone sent to Miss Anthony,\r\nwho was still in that city, the following:\r\n\r\n     In thinking over the points raised at our informal conference, it\r\n     seems to me that the substantial outcome is this: The committees\r\n     appointed by us respectively, if we conclude to appoint them, must\r\n     each agree upon a common name, a common constitution and a common\r\n     list of officers for the first year. A subsequent acceptance of\r\n     these by each association will thereafter constitute the two\r\n     societies one society. If you think there is a fair probability of\r\n     coming to an agreement I will proceed to appoint my committee.\r\n\r\n     As the formal overtures for union have come from the American\r\n     Association, it will be appropriate that our committee should draw\r\n     up the plan for union which appears to them the most feasible, and\r\n     forward it to Miss Foster, to be submitted to yours. Then your\r\n     committee will suggest such modifications as they may think\r\n     needful; and, if a mutually satisfactory result can be reached, the\r\n     name, constitution and list of officers will go to the executive\r\n     committee of each association for final action.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day Miss Blackwell sent to Miss Foster a comprehensive plan\r\nfor a union of the two societies, closing as follows: \"Since many\r\nmembers of the National society regard Mrs. Stone as the cause of the\r\ndivision, and many members of the American regard Mrs. Stanton and Miss\r\nAnthony as the cause of it, Mrs. Stone suggested that it would greatly\r\npromote a harmonious union, for those three ladies to agree in advance\r\nthat none of them would take the presidency of the united association.\"\r\nEarly in January this formal announcement and letter were sent to Miss\r\nFoster:\r\n\r\n     The committee of the National to sit in counsel with that of the\r\n     seven appointed by Lucy Stone, of the American, shall be: May\r\n     Wright Sewall, _Chairman_, Harriette R. Shattuck, Olympia Brown,\r\n     Helen M. Gougar, Laura M. Johns, Clara B. Colby, Rachel G. Foster,\r\n     _Secretary_.[36]\r\n\r\n     I hope all will sink personalities and exalt principles, seeking\r\n     only the best good for woman's enfranchisement, and that surely\r\n     will come through the union of all the friends of woman suffrage\r\n     into one great and grand national association which shall enable\r\n     them to present a solid front to the enemy. This must be based on\r\n     the principle of a genuine democracy, which shall give to each of\r\n     its members a voice in all its deliberations, either in person or\r\n     through representatives chosen by them, and to a constitution thus\r\n     based I am sure each of my seven chosen ones will contribute her\r\n     aid. Hoping that a consolidation of all our forces will be the\r\n     result of this overture from Lucy Stone and her society, I am, very\r\n     sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                             SUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nOn January 18, Miss Foster received from Miss Blackwell the list of the\r\nconference committee appointed by Mrs. Stone: Julia Ward Howe,\r\n_Chairman_, Wm. Dudley Foulke, Margaret W. Campbell, Anna H. Shaw, Mary\r\nF. Thomas, H. M. Tracy Cutler, Henry B. Blackwell, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony again wrote Miss Foster: \"I can not think of any\r\nstipulation I wish to make the basis of union save that we _unite_, and\r\nafter that discuss all measures and ways and means, officers and\r\nnewspapers, and cheerfully accept and abide by the rule of the majority.\r\nI do not wish to exact any pledges from Lucy Stone and her adherents,\r\nnor can I give any for Mrs. Stanton and her followers. When united we\r\nmust trust to the good sense of each, just as we have trusted during the\r\nexistence of the division. As Greeley said about resuming specie\r\npayment, '_the way to unite is to unite_' and trust the consequences.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not essential for the completeness of this work to reproduce in\r\ndetail the official proceedings, which extended through two years and\r\ncaused Miss Anthony often to write, \"I shall be glad when this\r\nfrittering away of time on mere forms is past.\" A basis of agreement\r\nfinally was reached, and the union was practically completed at the\r\nNational Convention which met in Washington, January 21, 1889. A\r\ncommittee of thirteen was selected to confer with the committee from the\r\nAmerican. This consisted of Miss Anthony and Mesdames Hooker, Minor,\r\nDuniway, Johns, Sewall, Perkins, Colby, Spofford, Brown, Blake, Gougar\r\nand Foster Avery. The Woman's Tribune thus described the result:\r\n\r\n     At the business session, January 24, 1889, they reported in\r\n     substance as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Name, etc._--The association to be called the National-American W.\r\n     S. A. The annual convention to be held at Washington.\r\n\r\n     _Chronology._--The next annual meeting of the joint society to\r\n     be--as it would be for the National--the twenty-second annual\r\n     Washington convention.\r\n\r\n     _Work._--To be for National and State legislation protecting women\r\n     in the exercise of their right to vote.\r\n\r\n     _Representation._--As provided in the new National constitution.\r\n\r\n     Where two associations exist in one State and will not unite, both\r\n     are to be accepted as auxiliary societies.\r\n\r\n     An earnest debate followed. Miss Anthony threw her influence\r\n     strongly in favor of union and carried many with her, even those\r\n     who openly expressed themselves that their judgment would be to\r\n     continue the two societies. The vote was then taken on union,\r\n     thirty voting for, eleven against.\r\n\r\n     Miss Alice Stone Blackwell and Rev. Anna H. Shaw were present on\r\n     behalf of the American Association, accepted the deviations from\r\n     the propositions as presented by that association, and felt\r\n     reasonably certain that it would endorse their action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours for equal rights, Alice Stone\r\nBlackwell.\"]\r\n\r\nNo one person contributed so much toward effecting the union of these\r\ntwo societies as Alice Stone Blackwell. On February 17, 1890, both\r\nbodies met in Washington and it was decided that the official boards of\r\nthe two should form the voting force until the joint temporary\r\norganization was completed. Councils were held in the great parlor and\r\ndining-room of the Riggs House. Both Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton had\r\nbeen willing, from the beginning of negotiations, to accept the\r\nproposition of the Americans that neither one of them, nor Lucy Stone,\r\nshould take the presidency of the united association, but from the\r\nNationals in every part of the country came a cry of dissent. Letters\r\npoured in declaring that Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton had borne the\r\nbrunt of the battle for forty years, that they had not once lowered the\r\nflag or made the question of woman suffrage subservient to any other,\r\nthat they were the head and heart of the movement, and that for them to\r\nbe deposed was out of the question.[37] It soon became evident that\r\nunless this point were conceded all hope of union would have to be\r\nbanished. While most of the delegates agreed that, in respect to\r\nseniority in years and work and also in consideration of her commanding\r\nability, Mrs. Stanton should be president, there were many who thought\r\nthat, because of her advanced age and the fact that she spent most of\r\nher time abroad, it would be better to elect Miss Anthony. The latter\r\nwas distracted by such a thought and at the final meeting of National\r\ndelegates preliminary to the joint convention, with all the earnestness\r\nof her strong nature and in a voice vibrating with emotion, she said:\r\n\r\n     I appeal to every woman who has any affection for the old National\r\n     or for me not to vote for Susan B. Anthony for president. I stand\r\n     in a delicate position. I have letters which accuse me of having\r\n     favored the union solely for personal and selfish considerations,\r\n     and of trying to put Mrs. Stanton out. Now what I have to say is,\r\n     don't vote for any human being but Mrs. Stanton. There are other\r\n     reasons why I wish her elected, but I have these personal ones:\r\n     When the division was made twenty years ago, it was because our\r\n     platform was too broad, because Mrs. Stanton was too radical; a\r\n     more conservative organization was wanted. If we Nationals divide\r\n     now and Mrs. Stanton is deposed from the presidency, we virtually\r\n     degrade her. If you have any love for our old association, which,\r\n     from the beginning, has stood like a rock in regard to creeds and\r\n     politics, demanding that every woman should be allowed to come upon\r\n     our platform to plead for her freedom--if you have any faith in\r\n     that grand principle--vote for Mrs. Stanton....\r\n\r\n     The National always has allowed the utmost liberty. Anything and\r\n     everything which stood in the way of progress was likely to get\r\n     knocked off our platform. I want every one who claims to be a\r\n     National to continue to stand for this principle. We have come now\r\n     to another turning-point and, if it is necessary, I will fight\r\n     forty years more to make our platform free for the Christian to\r\n     stand upon whether she be a Catholic and counts her beads, or a\r\n     Protestant of the straitest orthodox creed, just as I have fought\r\n     for the rights of the infidels the last forty years. These are the\r\n     principles I want you to maintain, that our platform may be kept as\r\n     broad as the universe, that upon it may stand the representatives\r\n     of all creeds and no creeds--Jew or Christian, Protestant or\r\n     Catholic, Gentile or Mormon, pagan or atheist.\r\n\r\nAt the joint executive session after the union was formally declared to\r\nbe consummated, the vote was: For president, Mrs. Stanton, 131; Miss\r\nAnthony, 90; for vice-president-at-large, Miss Anthony, 213. Lucy Stone\r\nwas unanimously elected chairman of the executive committee; Rachel\r\nFoster Avery, corresponding secretary; Alice Stone Blackwell, recording\r\nsecretary;[38] Jane H. Spofford, treasurer; Eliza T. Ward and Rev.\r\nFrederick W. Hinckley, auditors. This uniting of the two associations\r\nwas begun in 1887 and finished in 1890, in the most thoroughly official\r\nmanner, according to the most highly approved parliamentary methods, and\r\nthe final result was satisfactory to a large majority of the members of\r\nboth societies, who since that time have worked together in unbroken\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\nThe action of the American Association was almost unanimous, but the\r\nmembers of the National were widely divided. Letters of protest were\r\nreceived from many States, and several of its members attempted to form\r\nnew organizations. The executive sessions in Washington were the most\r\nstormy in the history of the association, and only the unsurpassed\r\nparliamentary knowledge of the chairman, May Wright Sewall, aided by the\r\nfirm co-operation of Miss Anthony, could have harmonized the opposing\r\nelements and secured a majority vote in favor of the union. There had\r\nbeen no time during the twenty years' division when Miss Anthony was not\r\nready to sink all personal feeling and unite the two societies for the\r\nsake of promoting the cause which she placed before all else in the\r\nworld; and from the first prospect of combining the forces, she used\r\nevery effort toward its accomplishment. It was a source of especial\r\ngratification that this was practically assured by the winter of 1888,\r\nwhen the International Council of Women met in Washington, as it enabled\r\nthe American Association to accept the invitation and send\r\nrepresentatives to this great convocation--which will now be considered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Zerelda G. Wallace (Signed: \"To my Dear friend Susan B.\r\nAnthony with love & severence, Zerelda G. Wallace\")]\r\n\r\nIt had long been the dream of Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton to form\r\nan International Suffrage Association for purposes of mutual helpfulness\r\nand the strength of co-operation. During 1883, when in Great Britain,\r\nthey discussed this subject with the women there and, as a result, a\r\nlarge committee of correspondence had been established to promote the\r\nforming of such an association. After a time it was judged expedient to\r\nenlarge its scope and make it an International Council, which should\r\nrepresent every department of woman's work. This was called to meet at\r\nWashington in 1888, the fortieth anniversary of the first organized\r\ndemand for the rights of women, the convention at Seneca Falls, and\r\nactive preparations had been in progress for more than a year. It was\r\ndecided at the suffrage convention held the previous winter that the\r\nNational Association should assume the entire responsibility for this\r\nInternational Council and should invite the participation of all\r\norganizations of women in the trades, professions, reforms, etc.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton and Mrs. Spofford were in Europe and this herculean task\r\nwas borne principally by Miss Anthony, May Wright Sewall and Rachel\r\nFoster.[39] Miss Anthony stayed in Washington for two months preceding\r\nthe council, perfecting the last arrangements. The amount of labor,\r\ntime, thought and anxiety involved in this year of preparation can not\r\nbe estimated. Nothing to compare with it ever had been attempted by\r\nwomen. Not the least part of the undertaking was the raising of the\r\n$13,000 which were needed to defray expenses, all secured by personal\r\nletters of appeal and admission fees, and disbursed with careful economy\r\nand judgment. The intention was to give the suffrage association the\r\nsame prominence as other organizations and no more. An entry in Miss\r\nAnthony's diary says: \"I have just received proof of the 'call' for the\r\ncouncil and struck out the paragraph saying, 'no one would be committed\r\nto suffrage who should attend.' I can't allow any such apologetic\r\ninvitation as that! There is no need to say anything about it.\" To her\r\nold friend Antoinette Brown Blackwell, who asked if only those women\r\nministers who had been regularly ordained were to be heard, Miss Anthony\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     I have felt all along that we ought to give a chance for the\r\n     expression of the highest and deepest religious thought of those\r\n     not ordained of men. Your wish to give the result of your research\r\n     opens the way for us to make the last day--Easter Sunday--voice the\r\n     new, the purer, the better worship of the living God. We'll have a\r\n     real symposium of woman's gospel. It is not fair to give only the\r\n     church-ordained women an opportunity to present their religious\r\n     thoughts, and now it shall be fixed so that the laity may have the\r\n     same. I don't want a controversy or a lot of negations, but shall\r\n     tell each one to give her strongest affirmation. This forever\r\n     saying a thing is false and failing to present the truth, is to me\r\n     a foolish waste of time, when almost everybody feels the old forms,\r\n     creeds and rituals to be only the mint, anise and cumin.\r\n\r\n     So, my dear, I am very, very glad that you and Lucy are both to be\r\n     on our platform, and we are to stand together again after these\r\n     twenty years. But none of the past! Let us rejoice in the good of\r\n     the present, and hope for more and more in the future.\r\n\r\nIn response to her letter asking him to take part on Pioneer Day,\r\nFrederick Douglass wrote:\r\n\r\n     I certainly shall, if I live and am well. The cause of woman\r\n     suffrage has under it a truth as eternal as the universe of\r\n     thought, and must triumph if this planet endures. I have been\r\n     calling up to my mind's eye that first convention in the small\r\n     Wesleyan Methodist church at Seneca Falls, where Mrs. Stanton, Mrs.\r\n     Mott and those other brave souls began a systematic and determined\r\n     agitation for a larger measure of liberty for woman, and how great\r\n     that little meeting now appears! It seems only yesterday since it\r\n     took place, and yet forty years have passed away and what a\r\n     revolution on this subject have we seen in the sentiment of the\r\n     American people and, in fact, of the civilized world! Who could\r\n     have thought that humble, modest, maiden convention, holding its\r\n     little white apron up to its face and wiping away the tear of\r\n     sympathy with woman in her hardships and the sigh of her soul for a\r\n     larger measure of freedom, would have become the mother of an\r\n     International Council of Women, right here in the capital of this\r\n     nation?\r\n\r\nMaria Mitchell, who was in feeble health (and died the next year) in\r\nexpressing her regrets said: \"I am taking a rest. I have worked more\r\nthan a half-century and, like stronger people, have become tired. I am\r\nmeaning to build my small observatory and keep up a sort of apology for\r\nstudy--because I am too old to dare do nothing. I wish I felt able to\r\ntake the journey and hear what others have to say and are ready to do.\r\nThe world moves, and I have full faith it will continue to move and to\r\nmove, for better and better, even when we have put aside the armor.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"The world moves and I have full faith it will\r\ncontinue to move and to move, for better and better, even when we have\r\nput aside the armor. Sincerely yours, Maria Mitchell.\"]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, Mrs. Stanton had written Miss Anthony: \"We have\r\njogged along pretty well for forty years or more. Perhaps mid the wreck\r\nof thrones and the undoing of so many friendships, sects, parties and\r\nfamilies, you and I deserve some credit for sticking together through\r\nall adverse winds, with so few ripples on the surface. When I get back\r\nto America I intend to cling to you closer than ever. I am thoroughly\r\nrested now and full of fight and fire, ready to travel and speak from\r\nMaine to Florida. Tell our suffrage daughters to brace up and get ready\r\nfor a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together when I come\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\nWhat then were her amazement, anger and grief to receive another letter\r\nfrom Mrs. Stanton a short time before the council, saying that a voyage\r\nacross the Atlantic so filled her with dread that she had about decided\r\nnot to undertake it! A fortieth anniversary of the Seneca Falls\r\nconvention without the woman who called it! And this when she had\r\ncounted on Mrs. Stanton to make the greatest speech of the whole meeting\r\nand cover the National Association with immortal glory! She says in her\r\njournal: \"I am ablaze and dare not write tonight.\" The next entry: \"I\r\nwrote the most terrific letter to Mrs. Stanton; it will start every\r\nwhite hair on her head.\" And then the following day the little book\r\nrecords: \"Well, I made my own heart ache all night, awake or asleep, by\r\nmy terrible arraignment, whether it touches her feelings or not.\" Ten\r\ndays later she writes: \"Received a cablegram from Mrs. Stanton, 'I am\r\ncoming,' so she has my letter. My mind is so relieved, I feel as if I\r\nwere treading on air.\"\r\n\r\nOn Mrs. Stanton's arrival a few days before the convention, Miss Anthony\r\nlearned, to her consternation, that she had prepared no speech for the\r\noccasion! She shut her up in a room at the Riggs House with pen and\r\npaper, kept a guard at the door, permitted no one to see her, and when\r\nthe time arrived she was ready with her usual magnificent address.\r\n\r\nThe council opened Sunday, March 25, in Albaugh's new opera house, with\r\nreligious services conducted entirely by women, Revs. Phebe A. Hanaford,\r\nAda C. Bowles, Antoinette Blackwell, Amanda Deyo, and a matchless sermon\r\nby Rev. Anna H. Shaw, \"The Heavenly Vision.\" It would be wholly\r\nimpossible to enter into a detailed account of this council, the\r\ngreatest woman's convention ever held.[40] Although twenty-five cents\r\nadmission was charged, and fifty cents for reserved seats, the opera\r\nhouse was crowded during the eight days and evenings, and seats were at\r\na premium. Miss Anthony presided over eight of the sixteen sessions.\r\nWhile every speaker was allowed the widest latitude, there was not at\r\nany time the slightest friction. Letters were read from celebrated\r\npeople in most of the countries of Europe and all parts of America. At\r\nthe pioneer's meeting were eight men and thirty-six women who had been\r\nconnected with the movement for woman suffrage forty years.[41]\r\n\r\nAmong the social courtesies extended to this distinguished body of\r\nwomen, were a reception at the White House by President and Mrs.\r\nCleveland; handsome entertainments by Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford,\r\nand Senator and Mrs. T. W. Palmer; a reception at the Riggs House; many\r\nsmaller parties, dinners and luncheons; and numerous social gatherings\r\nof women doctors, lawyers, etc. At all of the large functions Miss\r\nAnthony, Mrs. Stanton and Lucy Stone stood at the left hand of the\r\nhostess, while the other officials and the foreign delegates were also\r\nin the \"receiving line.\" At the White House Miss Anthony made the\r\npresentations to the President. As every newspaper in the country had\r\ncomplimentary notices of this council and the prominent ladies connected\r\nwith it, it is scarcely possible to discriminate. The Baltimore Sun\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     The council began its deliberations in the finest humor with\r\n     everybody, particularly with that prime favorite, Susan B. Anthony.\r\n     This lady daily grows upon all present; the woman suffragists love\r\n     her for her good works, the audience for her brightness and wit,\r\n     and the multitude of press representatives for her frank, plain,\r\n     open, business-like way of doing everything connected with the\r\n     council. Miss Anthony when in repose looks worn with the conflict\r\n     she has waged, though when she goes into action her angular face\r\n     loses its tired look and becomes all animation. Her word is the\r\n     parliamentary law of the meeting. Whatever she says is done without\r\n     murmur or dissent. The women of the council are saved any\r\n     parliamentary discussions such as arise in the meetings of men;\r\n     they acknowledge that she is an autocrat. All are agreed that no\r\n     better system than the absolute control of Susan B. Anthony can be\r\n     devised.\r\n\r\nThe New York World commented:\r\n\r\n     If ever there was a gay-hearted, good-natured woman it is certainly\r\n     Miss Anthony. From the beginning of this council it is she who has\r\n     kept the fun barometer away up. The gray-headed friends of her\r\n     youth are all \"girls\" to her, and she is a girl among them.\r\n     Parliamentary rules have been by no means so severe as to keep\r\n     even the regular proceedings free from her lively interpolation and\r\n     comment. When Miss Anthony has felt the public pulse or looked at\r\n     her watch and seen that a speech has gone far enough, she says\r\n     under her breath, \"Your time's about up, my dear.\" If the speaker\r\n     continues, the next thing is, \"I guess you'll have to stop now;\r\n     it's more than ten minutes.\" When this fails, she usually begins to\r\n     hang gently on the orator's skirt, and if pluckings and pullings\r\n     fail, she then subsides with a quizzical smile, or stands erect and\r\n     uncompromising by the speaker's side. There is none of the rude\r\n     beating of the gavel, nor any paraphrase of \"The gentleman's time\r\n     is up,\" which marks the stiff proceedings of men \"in congress\r\n     assembled.\" To an unprejudiced eye this free-and-easy method of\r\n     procedure might lack symmetry and dignity, but there is not the\r\n     slightest doubt that Miss Anthony has been as wise as a serpent\r\n     while being as gentle as a dove.\r\n\r\nWhen Frances E. Willard rose to address the council, she laid her hand\r\ntenderly on Miss Anthony's shoulder and said: \"I remember when I was\r\ndreadfully afraid of Susan, and Lucy too; but now I love and honor them,\r\nand I can not put into words my sense of what it means to me to have the\r\nblessing of these women who have made it possible for more timid ones\r\nlike myself to come forward and take our part in the world's work. If\r\nthey had not blazed the trees and pioneered the way, we should not have\r\ndared to come. If there is one single drop of chivalric blood in woman's\r\nveins, it ought to bring a tinge of pride to the face that Susan B.\r\nAnthony, Lucy Stone, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Julia Ward Howe and these\r\nother grand women, our leaders and our foremothers, are here for us to\r\ngreet; that they, who heard so much that was not agreeable, may hear an\r\noccasional pleasant word while they are alive.\" Very few of the speakers\r\nfailed to express their deep feeling of personal obligation and the\r\nindebtedness of all women to the early labors of Miss Anthony and the\r\nother pioneers.\r\n\r\nIn her letter to the Union Signal, Miss Willard gave this bit of\r\ndescription: \"The central figure of the council was Susan B. Anthony, in\r\nher black dress and pretty red silk shawl, with her gray-brown hair\r\nsmoothly combed over a regal head, worthy of any statesman. Her mingled\r\ngood-nature and firmness, her unselfish purpose and keen perception of\r\nthe right thing to do, endeared her alike to those whom she admonished\r\nand those whom she praised. In her sixty-ninth year, dear 'Susan B.'\r\nseems not over fifty-five. She has a wonderful constitution, and the\r\nprodigies of work she has accomplished have forever put to rout the\r\nignorant notion that women lack physical endurance.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year of preliminary work for this great council, the thought came\r\nmany times to May Wright Sewall that it ought to result in something\r\nmore than one brief convention, and she conceived the idea of a\r\npermanent International and also a permanent National Council of Women.\r\nDuring the week in Washington she presented her plan to a large number\r\nof the leaders who regarded it with approval. Miss Anthony, chairman of\r\nthe meeting, by request, appointed a committee of fifteen who reported\r\nin favor of permanent councils, and Miss Willard presented an outline of\r\nconstitutions. After a number of meetings of the delegates the councils\r\nwere officially formed, March 31, 1888, \"to include the organized\r\nworking forces of the world's womanhood,\" in the belief that \"such a\r\nfederation will increase the world's sum total of womanly courage,\r\nefficiency and esprit de corps, widen the horizon, correct the tendency\r\nof an exaggerated impression of one's own work as compared with that of\r\nothers, and put the wisdom and experience of each at the service of\r\nall.\" A simple form of constitution was adopted, and it was decided that\r\nthe National Council should meet once in three years and the\r\nInternational once in five.[42]\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the close of the council, the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation held its twentieth annual convention and, as many of the\r\ndelegates remained, the meetings were nearly as crowded as those of the\r\ncouncil had been. A local paper remarked \"that it seemed as if the\r\nWashington people could never hear enough about woman suffrage.\" A fine\r\naddress by Caroline E. Merrick was an especial feature, as it presented\r\nthe question from the standpoint of a southern woman. The Senate\r\ncommittee granted a hearing, the speakers being presented by Miss\r\nAnthony. Mrs. Stanton made the principal address, a grand plea for human\r\nequality, and the grave and dignified committee gave her a round of\r\napplause. She was followed by Frances E. Willard and Julia Ward Howe;\r\nLaura Ormiston Chant and Alice Scatcherd, England; Isabelle Bogelot,\r\nFrance; Sophia Magelsson Groth, Norway; Alli Trygg, Finland; Bessie\r\nStarr Keefer, Canada.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony received many pleasant letters after the council; among\r\nthem one from her friend Mrs. Samuel E. Sewall, of Boston, in which she\r\nsaid: \"We want to congratulate you upon the very satisfactory and\r\ngratifying result of the council. I hear from the delegates on all sides\r\nmost enthusiastic accounts of the whole affair, and of your wonderful\r\npowers and energy. Mr. Blackwell is loud in your praise. All this might\r\nbe expected from the delegates, but what pleases me still more is the\r\nrespectful tone of nearly all the newspapers. Even the sneering Nation\r\nhas admitted an article in praise of the council.\" In all Miss Anthony's\r\nown letters there was not the slightest reference to any feeling of\r\nfatigue or desire for rest, but she seemed only to be stimulated to\r\ngreater energy. It was impossible for her to respond to half the\r\ninvitations which came from all parts of the country, but usually she\r\nselected the places where she felt herself most needed, without any\r\nregard to her own pleasure or comfort. She did, however, accept a\r\ncordial invitation to attend the annual Boston Suffrage Festival, and\r\nwas royally entertained for several days.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of June 9, Central Music Hall, Chicago, was packed with\r\nan audience of representative men and women. Frances E. Willard\r\npresided,[43] prayer was offered by Rev. Florence Kollock, and Mrs.\r\nOrmiston Chant gave a wonderfully electric address on the \"Moral\r\nRelations of Men and Women to Each Other.\" She was followed by Dr. Kate\r\nBushnell in a thrilling talk on \"Legislation as it Deals with Social\r\nPurity.\" Miss Anthony closed the program with a ringing speech showing\r\nthe need of the ballot in the hands of women to remedy such evils as had\r\nbeen depicted by the other speakers. No abstract can give an idea of her\r\nmagnetic force when profoundly stirred by such recitals as had been made\r\nat this meeting.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards a largely-attended reception was given by the\r\nWoman's Club of Chicago to Miss Anthony, Isabella Beecher Hooker and\r\nBaroness Gripenberg, of Finland.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1888, the National Association as usual sent delegates\r\nto each of the presidential conventions, asking for a suffrage plank,\r\nand as usual they were ignored by Republicans and Democrats. Miss\r\nAnthony and Mrs. Hooker had headquarters in the parlors of Mrs. Celia\r\nWhipple Wallace, at the Sherman House, Chicago, during the Republican\r\nconvention in June. They issued an open letter citing the record of the\r\nparty in regard to women, and asking for recognition, but received no\r\nconsideration. In the Woman's Tribune, Miss Anthony made this forcible\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n     Had the best representative suffrage women of every State in the\r\n     Union been in Chicago, established in national headquarters,\r\n     working with the men of their State delegations, as well as with\r\n     the resolution committee, I have not a doubt that the Republican\r\n     platform would have contained a splendid plank, pledging the party\r\n     to this broad and true interpretation of the Constitution. Every\r\n     other reform had its scores and hundreds of representatives here,\r\n     pleading for the incorporation of its principles in the platform\r\n     and working for the nomination of the men who would best voice\r\n     their plans. Women never will be heard and heeded until they make\r\n     themselves a power, irresistible in numbers and strength, moral,\r\n     intellectual and financial, in all the formative gatherings of the\r\n     parties they would influence. Therefore, I now beg of our women not\r\n     to lose another opportunity to be present at every political\r\n     convention during this summer, to urge the adoption of woman\r\n     suffrage resolutions and the nomination of men pledged to support\r\n     them. \"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty\" for women as well\r\n     as for men.\r\n\r\nFrom Chicago Miss Anthony went directly to Indianapolis and, with Mrs.\r\nSewall, called at the Harrison residence. She says: \"We met a most\r\ncordial reception and while the general did not declare himself in favor\r\nof woman's enfranchisement, he expressed great respect for those who\r\nare seeking it.\" The two ladies then addressed an open letter to General\r\nHarrison, urging that in accepting the nomination he would interpret as\r\nincluding women that plank in the Republican platform which declared:\r\n\"We recognize the supreme and sovereign right of every lawful citizen to\r\ncast one free ballot in all public elections and to have that ballot\r\nduly counted;\"[44] but this reasonable request was politely ignored.\r\n\r\nSarah Knox Goodrich and Ellen Clark Sargent, of California, sent the\r\nfollowing telegram to their fellow-citizen, Morris M. Estee, chairman of\r\nthe National Republican Convention: \"Please ascertain, for many\r\ninterested women, if the clause in the platform concerning the sovereign\r\nright of every lawful citizen to a free ballot, includes the women of\r\nthe United States.\" To this Mr. Estee telegraphed reply, \"I do not think\r\nthe platform is so construed here.\" This ended the battle of 1888, as\r\nfar as women were concerned, and those who might have been the ablest\r\nadvocates which any political party could put upon its platform were\r\nrelegated to silence during the campaign.\r\n\r\nOn August 7, Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton spoke at Byron Center, and\r\nwere entertained by Mrs. Newton Green. Miss Anthony addressed a large\r\naudience at Jamestown on the 10th and was the guest of Mrs. Reuben E.\r\nFenton. During part of the summer, for a little recreation, she took\r\nhold of the great heterogeneous mass of bills and receipts of the\r\nNational W. S. A. for the past four years and compiled them into a neat,\r\naccurate financial report of seventeen pages, in which every dollar\r\nreceived and disbursed during that time was acknowledged and accounted\r\nfor, without any \"sundries\" or other makeshifts for the sake of\r\naccuracy. As the total amount reached nearly $18,000, a large part of\r\nwhich had been received in sums of one or two dollars, the labor\r\ninvolved may be appreciated. Miss Anthony did this, as she did many\r\nother disagreeable things, not because they were officially her duty,\r\nbut because they ought to be done and there was no one else ready to\r\nundertake them. She always was restive under red tape regulations. For\r\nmany years she was forced to take the lead in all departments of the\r\nsuffrage work and when they finally became systematized, with a head at\r\neach, she sometimes grew impatient at delay and usurped the functions of\r\nothers without intending any breach of official etiquette. And so when\r\nthis financial statement was completed, she published it without waiting\r\nfor money or authority, and wrote to the national treasurer, Mrs.\r\nSpofford, who had recently returned from Europe:\r\n\r\n     Andrew Jackson-like, I decided to assume the responsibility of\r\n     sending to each member of the association a copy of the Council\r\n     Report with one of the National's financial statement. I am writing\r\n     a personal letter to all, explaining our double keeping of our\r\n     pledge and asking them to return contributions, if they are able,\r\n     for this permanent and nice report. I do not know what results in\r\n     cash will come of it to the National, but I do know that the\r\n     poorest and hardest-working women who pinched out their dollars to\r\n     send, think that we promised them therefor this book-report of the\r\n     council. So all in all I decided, against Miss Foster, Mrs. Stanton\r\n     and your own dear self, to give each the report, leaving her to do\r\n     as she feels most comfortable about sending to the treasurer\r\n     payment in return.\r\n\r\nA few days later she writes: \"I mailed 800 letters yesterday, and we\r\nhave sent over 1,500 Reports, with 800 more promised.\" Could any pen\r\ngive an adequate idea of the amount of work accomplished by that\r\ntireless brain and those never-resting hands?\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony spoke on Woman's Day, October 12, at the Centennial\r\nCelebration in Columbus, O. A newspaper correspondent drew this contrast\r\nbetween her address and those of the women of the W. C. T. U.:\r\n\r\n     Each prayer started heavenward was weighted with\r\n     politics--political prohibition. When the eloquent speakers of the\r\n     afternoon dealt a stinging blow under the belt to one of the\r\n     leading political parties, the applause was tremendous, cheers and\r\n     \"amens\" mingling in a sacrilegious chorus of approval. On the other\r\n     hand, when Miss Anthony made her calm, strong and really logical\r\n     argument in favor of woman suffrage, giving each party, so far as\r\n     related to action of States, just praise or censure, she was\r\n     received coldly. It did not seem to count for anything that she had\r\n     been a pioneer in the cause of temperance. That white record was\r\n     stained because she cast their idol down--she showed that\r\n     prohibition had failed in Kansas in the large cities, whether under\r\n     a Democratic or a Republican governor, or under St. John, the\r\n     Prohibition governor; in every administration it was a failure,\r\n     because even there women had only a restricted vote, and public\r\n     sentiment without the ballot counted for naught. There were no\r\n     little graves in her speech, no weeping willows by winding streams\r\n     where lay broken hearts in tombs unmarked. It was a simple\r\n     statement of the cause a brave woman had at heart.\r\n\r\nShe attended the State conventions at Ames, Ia., and at Emporia, Kan.,\r\nwhere she was the guest of Senator and Mrs. Kellogg. From there she went\r\nto Leavenworth, and later to Omaha for the Nebraska convention. She then\r\nengaged for the fall and winter with the Slayton Lecture Bureau at $60 a\r\nnight, and began again the tiresome round throughout the Western States.\r\n\r\nIn this autumn of 1888, Miss Anthony received a severe shock in the\r\nannouncement of the approaching marriage of Rachel Foster to Cyrus\r\nMiller Avery, of Chicago. He had attended the International Council the\r\npreceding spring with his mother, Rosa Miller Avery, known prominently\r\nin suffrage and other public work in Illinois. Here he had seen Miss\r\nFoster in her youth and beauty, carrying a large part of the\r\nresponsibility connected with that important gathering, and had fallen\r\nin love with her at first sight. During her long life Miss Anthony had\r\nseen one young girl after another take up the work of woman's\r\nregeneration, fit herself for it, grow into a power, then marry, give it\r\nall up and drop out of sight. \"I would not object to marriage,\" she\r\nwrote, \"if it were not that women throw away every plan and purpose of\r\ntheir own life, to conform to the plans and purposes of the man's life.\r\nI wonder if it is woman's real, true nature always to abnegate self.\"\r\nMiss Foster had developed unusual ability and for a number of years had\r\nbeen Miss Anthony's mainstay in the suffrage work, and had grown very\r\nclose into her heart; it is not surprising, therefore, that she learned\r\nof the coming marriage with dismay. She accepted the situation as\r\ngracefully as possible, however, and, although too far away to attend\r\nthe wedding, sent most cordial wishes for the happiness of the\r\nnewly-married.[45]\r\n\r\nThe year 1888 brought to Miss Anthony many honors, but it brought also\r\nthe usual quota of the bereavements which come with every passing year\r\nwhen one nears threescore and ten. Her cherished friend, Dr. Clemence\r\nLozier, had passed away; Edward M. Davis, whose faithful friendship\r\nnever had failed, was no more; A. Bronson Alcott and his daughter Louisa\r\nhad gone to test the truth of the new philosophy; and other dear ones\r\nhad dropped out of the narrowing circle. But as a partial compensation,\r\nthere had come into her life some new friends who were destined, if not\r\nto fill the place of those who were gone, to make another for themselves\r\nin her affections and her labors quite as helpful and important. Chief\r\namong these was Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, who, from the time of the\r\nInternational Council, gave her deepest love and truest allegiance.\r\nUntil then she had not been near enough Miss Anthony to realize the\r\nnobility and grandeur of her character, but thenceforth she accorded to\r\nher all the devotion and reverence of her own strong and beautiful\r\nnature. In a letter written after she had returned to her home in\r\nBoston, she said: \"From my heart I pray that I may always be worthy your\r\nlove and confidence. To know you is a blessing; to be trusted by you is\r\nworth far more than my efforts for our work have cost me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] To these afterwards were added from the executive committee,\r\nIsabella Beecher Hooker, _Chairman_, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Mary B. Clay,\r\nSarah M. Perkins, Lillie Devereux Blake, Mary F. Eastman, Clara Neymann,\r\nElizabeth Boynton Harbert.\r\n\r\n[37] Many letters are on file making these declarations. It is not\r\npracticable to quote them here, but a place may be made for an extract\r\nfrom that of Zerelda G. Wallace to Miss Anthony: \"While they do not\r\nunder-estimate the work of any of the pioneers, the hearts of the women\r\nall over the country are turning to you. They feel that they are yours,\r\nand you are theirs. The suffrage women look to you with as much loyalty\r\nand affection as the temperance women to Miss Willard. There are\r\nthousands of them who would rally around you with an enthusiasm which no\r\none else can inspire. You will do me the credit to believe that I speak\r\nsolely for the good of the work to which you have given your life.\"\r\n\r\n[38] Mrs. Avery and Miss Blackwell have continued ever since to fill\r\nthese positions most acceptably to the association.\r\n\r\n[39] The magnitude of the work of the council may be better appreciated\r\nby the mention of a few figures in this connection. There were printed\r\nand distributed by mail 10,000 calls and 10,000 appeals; sketches were\r\nprepared of the lives and work of speakers and delegates and circulated\r\nby a press committee of over ninety persons in many States; March 10,\r\nthe first edition (5,000) of the sixteen-page program was issued; this\r\nwas followed by five other editions of 5,000 each and a final seventh\r\nedition of 7,000. About 4,000 letters were written. Including those\r\nconcerning railroad rates, not less than 10,000 more circulars of\r\nvarious kinds were printed and distributed. A low estimate of the number\r\nof pages thus issued gives 672,000. During the week of the council and\r\nthe week of the convention of the National W. S. A. the Woman's Tribune\r\nwas published by Mrs. Colby eight times (four days sixteen pages, four\r\ndays twelve pages), the daily edition averaging 12,500.\r\n\r\nAn international convention of men, held in Washington the same year,\r\ncost in round numbers $50,000.--Official Report.\r\n\r\n[40] One session each was given to Education, Philanthropy, Temperance,\r\nIndustries, Professions, Organizations, Legal Conditions, Social Purity,\r\nPolitical Conditions, etc., which were discussed by the women most\r\nprominent in the several departments. Fifty-three different national\r\norganizations of women were represented by eighty speakers and\r\nforty-nine delegates from England, France, Norway, Denmark, Finland,\r\nIndia, Canada and the United States.\r\n\r\n[41] The fine stenographic reports of this council were made by Mary F.\r\nSeymour and a corps of women assistants. The official proceedings, with\r\nspeeches in full, may be obtained of the corresponding secretary of the\r\nNational-American W. S. A.\r\n\r\n[42] National Council: _President_, Frances E. Willard;\r\n_vice-president-at-large_, Susan B. Anthony; _corresponding secretary_,\r\nMay Wright Sewall; _recording secretary_, Mary F. Eastman; _treasurer_,\r\nM. Louise Thomas.\r\n\r\n[43] This meeting was arranged by Dr. Frances Dickinson, who had\r\npersuaded Miss Anthony to make the journey to Chicago in order to\r\npreside over it. On the way to the hall she was detained at a drawbridge\r\nand Miss Willard kindly took her place.\r\n\r\n[44] See Appendix for full text of letter.\r\n\r\n[45] Mrs. Foster Avery has proved an exception to the rule and, during\r\nthe ten years since her marriage, has performed as much work, to say the\r\nleast, as any of the younger generation of women, besides contributing\r\nthousands of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nCONVENTIONS FROM WASHINGTON TO SOUTH DAKOTA.\r\n\r\n1889.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eleventh of January, 1889, found Miss Anthony in her usual pleasant\r\nsuite of rooms at the Riggs House. She plunged at once into preparations\r\nfor the approaching convention, interviewing congressmen, calling at the\r\nnewspaper offices and conferring with local committees. The Twenty-first\r\nNational Convention opened January 21, in the Congregational church,\r\nwith the speakers as bright and full of hope as they had been through\r\nall the score of years. The opening address was given by Hon. A. G.\r\nRiddle and, during the sessions, excellent speeches were made by Hon.\r\nWilliam D. Kelley, Senator Blair, Rev. Alexander Kent and State Senator\r\nBlue, of Kansas. Rev. Anna H. Shaw made her first appearance on the\r\nNational platform and delivered her splendid oration, \"The Fate of\r\nRepublics.\" Laura M. Johns gave a practical and pleasing talk on\r\n\"Municipal Suffrage in Kansas;\" and there was the usual array of talent.\r\nMiss Anthony presided, putting every speaker to the front and making a\r\nsubstantial background of her own felicitous little speeches, each\r\ncontaining an argument in a nutshell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Very truly yours, Wm D Kelley\"]\r\n\r\nWhile in Washington she was entertained at dinner by the \"Six O'clock\r\nClub,\" and seated at the right hand of its president Dr. Wm. A.\r\nHammond. The subject for the evening was \"Robert Elsmere\" and, in giving\r\nher opinion, she said she had found nothing new in the book; all those\r\ntheological questions had been discussed and settled by the Quakers long\r\nago. What distressed her most was the marriage of Robert and Catherine,\r\nwho, any outsider could have seen, were utterly unfitted for one\r\nanother, and she wondered if there could be any way by which young\r\npeople might be able to know each other better before marrying.\r\n\r\nOn February 11, Miss Anthony spoke in Cincinnati to an audience of\r\n2,000, under the management of A. W. Whelpley, city librarian.[46] The\r\nCommercial Gazette commented: \"Miss Susan B. Anthony had every reason\r\nfor congratulation on the audience, both as to quality and quantity,\r\nwhich greeted her Sunday afternoon at the Grand Opera House. Her\r\ndiscourse proved to be one of the most entertaining of the Unity Club\r\nlectures this season, and if she did not succeed in gaining many\r\nproselytes to her well-known views regarding woman's emancipation, she\r\ncertainly reaped the reward of presenting the arguments in an\r\ninteresting and logical manner. Every neatly turned point was received\r\nwith applause and that good-natured laughter that carries with it not a\r\nlittle of the element of conviction. As of old, this pioneer of the\r\nwoman's cause is abundantly able to return sarcasm for sarcasm, as well\r\nas to present an array of facts in a manner which would do credit to the\r\nmost astute of our politicians.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was much gratified at the cordial reception given her in\r\nCincinnati and the evident success of her speech, and Tuesday morning,\r\nwith a happy heart, took the train for her western lecture tour. She\r\nsettled herself comfortably, glanced over her paper and was about to lay\r\nit aside when her eye caught the word \"Leavenworth.\" A hasty glance told\r\nher of the drowning the day before of Susie B. Anthony, while out\r\nskating with a party of schoolmates! Susie B., her namesake, her\r\nbeloved niece, as dear as a daughter, and with many of her own strong\r\ncharacteristics--she was almost stunned. Telegraphing at once to cancel\r\nher engagements, she hastened to Leavenworth. Just six months before,\r\nColonel and Mrs. Anthony had lost a little daughter, five years old, and\r\nnow the sudden taking away of this beautiful girl in her seventeenth\r\nyear was a blow of crushing force. She found a stricken household to\r\nwhom she could offer but small consolation out of her own sorrowing\r\nheart. After the last services she attempted to fill her engagements in\r\nArkansas, speaking in Helena, Fort Smith and Little Rock; at the last\r\nplace being introduced to the audience by Governor James B. Eagle. She\r\nwas so filled with sympathy for her brother and his wife that she gave\r\nup her other lectures and returned to Leavenworth, where she remained\r\nfor two months, going away only for two or three meetings.\r\n\r\nShe lectured in Memorial Hall, St. Louis, March 5,[47] and a brilliant\r\nreception was given her at the Lindell Hotel. On March 9, she spoke at\r\nJefferson City, where the Daily Tribune contained a full synopsis of her\r\naddress, beginning as follows: \"The hall of the House of Representatives\r\nwas crowded last night as never before, with ladies and gentlemen--State\r\nofficials, members of the general assembly, clerks of the departments\r\nand of the legislature, and all the students from Lincoln Institute....\r\nMiss Anthony was received with applause, and plunged at once into the\r\nsubject which for many years has made her name a household word in every\r\nEnglish-speaking country on the globe.\"\r\n\r\nLeavenworth was in the midst of an exciting municipal campaign and\r\nColonel Anthony had been nominated for mayor by the Republicans. Miss\r\nAnthony made a number of speeches, at Chickering Hall, the Conservatory\r\nof Music, the different churches, meetings of colored people, etc. The\r\nnight of the last great rally she writes in her diary: \"It does seem as\r\nif the cause of law and order and temperance ought to win, but the\r\nsaloon element resorts to such tricks that honest people can not match\r\nthem.\" So it seemed in this case, and Colonel Anthony was defeated. The\r\nRepublicans, both men and women, were divided amongst themselves with\r\nthe usual results.\r\n\r\nHer grief over the untimely death of Susie B. was still fresh, and in a\r\nletter to a friend who had just suffered a great bereavement, she said:\r\n\"It is a part of the inevitable and the living can not do otherwise than\r\nsubmit, however rebellious they may feel; but we will clutch after the\r\nloved ones in spite of all faith and all philosophy. By and by, when one\r\ngets far enough away from the hurt of breaking the branch from its tree,\r\nthere does, there must, come a sweet presence of the spirit of the loved\r\nand gone that soothes the ache of the earlier days. That every one has\r\nto suffer from the loss of loving and loved ones, does not make our\r\nanguish any the less.\"\r\n\r\nTo the sorrowing father she wrote after she returned home: \"Can you not\r\nfeel when you look at those lonely mounds, that the spirits, the part of\r\nthem that made life, are not there but in your own home, in your own\r\nheart, ever present? It surely is more blessed to have loved and lost\r\nthan never to have loved.... Which of us shall follow them first we can\r\nnot tell, but if it should be I, lay my body away without the\r\nheartbreak, the agony that must come when the young go. Try to believe\r\nthat all is well, that however misunderstood or misunderstanding, all\r\nthere is clear to the enlarged vision. Whenever I have suffered from the\r\nmemory of hasty or unkind words to those who have gone, my one comfort\r\nalways has been in the feeling that their spirits still live and are so\r\nmuch finer that they understand and forgive.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony went from Leavenworth to Indianapolis for a few days'\r\nconference with Mrs. Sewall on matters connected with the National\r\nSuffrage Association and National Council of Women. She writes in her\r\ndiary: \"Mrs. Sewall introduced me to the girls of her Classical School\r\nas one who had dared live up to her highest dream. I did not say a word\r\nfor fear it might not be the right one.\" From here she journeyed to\r\nPhiladelphia, stopping, she says, \"with dear Adeline Thomson, whose\r\ndoor is always open to those who are working for women;\"[48] thence to\r\nNew York for the State convention April 26.\r\n\r\nThe preceding evening a reception was tendered Miss Anthony at the Park\r\nHotel, where she notes, \"I wore my garnet velvet and point lace.\" This\r\ndid not suit the correspondent of the Chicago Herald, who said: \"Her\r\nfutile efforts to adjust her train with the toe of her number seven\r\nboot, instead of the approved backward sweep of heel, demonstrated that\r\nshe certainly was not 'to the manner born.'\" He then continued to sneer\r\nat the suffrage women for \"adopting the social elegancies of life\r\ninaugurated by Mrs. Ashton Dilke, at the council last winter;\" evidently\r\nunaware that Miss Anthony had been wearing her velvet gown since 1883.\r\nBut the same day the New York Sun had a long and serious editorial to\r\nthe effect that \"equal suffrage never would be successful until it was\r\nmade fashionable.\" This illustrates how hard it is to please everybody,\r\nand also how prone men are to make a woman's work inseparable from her\r\ngarments, always giving more prominence to what she wears than to what\r\nshe says and does, and then censuring her because she \"gives so much\r\ntime and thought to her clothes.\" Even from far-off Memphis the\r\nAvalanche tumbled down on Miss Anthony for wearing point lace \"when the\r\nwomen who wore their lives out making it were no better than slaves.\"\r\nDoubtless the editor abjured linen shirt-bosoms because the poor\r\nIrishwomen who bleach the flax are paid starvation wages. The Brooklyn\r\nTimes also jumped into the breach and, in a column editorial, attempted\r\nto prove that \"the ballot for woman is as superfluous as a corset for a\r\nman.\" Thus does the male mind illustrate its superiority!\r\n\r\nOn May 17, Miss Anthony addressed the Woman's Political Equality Club of\r\nRochester, in the Unitarian church, which was crowded to its capacity.\r\nShe spoke in Warren, O., May 21, the guest of Hon. Ezra B. Taylor and\r\nhis daughter, Mrs. Upton. The next day the two ladies went to the Ohio\r\nState Convention at Akron and were entertained at the palatial home of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Lewis Miller. A dinner was given to Miss Anthony, Mrs.\r\nZerelda G. Wallace and Rev. Anna Shaw by Mr. and Mrs. Adolph Schumacher.\r\n\r\nA report went the rounds of the newspapers at this time saying that\r\n\"Miss Anthony had renounced woman suffrage.\" It was started doubtless by\r\nsome one who supposed her to be so narrow as to abandon a great\r\nprinciple because her brother had been defeated in a city where women\r\nhad the suffrage. The Portland Oregonian having used this alleged\r\nrenunciation as the basis for a leading editorial, the ladies of Tacoma,\r\nWash., where women had been arbitrarily disfranchised by the supreme\r\ncourt, sent a telegram to Miss Anthony asking if the rumor were true.\r\nShe telegraphed in reply: \"Report false; am stronger than ever and bid\r\nWashington restore woman suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nShe went to Philadelphia to attend the wedding, June 21, of one of her\r\nfamily of nieces, who filled the place in her great heart which would\r\nhave been given to her daughters, had she chosen marriage instead of the\r\nworld's work for all womankind. When her sister Hannah had died years\r\nbefore, Miss Anthony had brought the little orphan, Helen Louise Mosher,\r\nto her own home, where she had remained until grown. For some time she\r\nhad been a successful supervisor of kindergarten work in Philadelphia\r\nand today she was the happy bride of Alvan James, a prominent business\r\nman of that city.[49] Miss Anthony was pleased with the marriage and the\r\nyoung couple started on their wedding tour with her blessing.\r\n\r\nIn July a charming letter was received from Madame Maria Deraismes,\r\npresident of the French Woman's Congress, conveying \"the greetings of\r\nthe women of France to the leader of women in America.\" On the Fourth\r\nMiss Anthony addressed a Grangers' picnic, at Lyons, held under the\r\ngreat trees in the dooryard of Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Bradley, who were\r\nher hosts. One hot week this month was spent with Dr. Sarah A. Dolley, a\r\nprominent physician of Rochester, in her summer home at Long Pond. Early\r\nin August, with her niece Maud, she took a very delightful trip through\r\nthe lake and mountain regions of New York. After a visit at Saratoga\r\nthey went up Mount McGregor, and Miss Anthony writes in her diary: \"Here\r\nwe saw the room where General Grant died, the invalid chair, the clothes\r\nhe wore, medicine bottles, etc.--very repulsive. If the grand mementoes\r\nof his life's work were on exhibition it would be inspiring, but these\r\nghastly reminders of his disease and death are too horrible.\"\r\n\r\nThey spent a few days at the Fort William Henry Hotel on beautiful Lake\r\nGeorge, and she says: \"Several of the colored waiters formerly at the\r\nRiggs House recognized me the moment I entered the dining-room, and one\r\nof them brought me a lovely bouquet.\" They sailed through Lake Champlain\r\nto Montreal, stopping at the Windsor, visiting the grand cathedrals and\r\nenjoying the glorious view from the summit of the Royal mountain. Then\r\nthey journeyed to the Berkshire hills and enjoyed many visits with the\r\nnumerous relatives scattered throughout that region. At Brooklyn they\r\nwere the guests of the cousins Lucien and Ellen Hoxie Squier.\r\n\r\nEarly in July Miss Anthony had accepted an invitation to address the\r\nSeidl Club, who were to give a luncheon at Brighton Beach, the\r\nfashionable resort on Coney Island. The invitation had been extended\r\nthrough Mrs. Laura C. Holloway, one of the editorial staff of the\r\nBrooklyn Eagle and a valued friend of many years' standing, who wrote:\r\n\"Not nearly all our members are suffragists, but all of them honor you\r\nas a great and noble representative of the sex. You can do more good by\r\nmeeting this body of musical and literary women than by addressing a\r\ndozen out-and-out suffrage meetings. You will find many old friends to\r\ngreet you, and a loving and proud welcome from yours devotedly.\" She\r\naddressed the club August 30, after an elegant luncheon served to 300\r\nmembers and guests. She selected for her subject, \"Woman's Need of\r\nPecuniary Independence,\" and her remarks were received with much\r\nenthusiasm. \"Broadbrim's\" New York letter thus describes the occasion:\r\n\r\n     The Seidl Club had an elegant time down at Coney Island this week,\r\n     and dear old Susan B. Anthony addressed the members, many of whom\r\n     are among the representative women of the land. It was the custom\r\n     in years gone by for a lot of paper-headed ninnies, who write cheap\r\n     jokes about mothers-in-law, to fire their paper bullets at Susan B.\r\n     She has lived to see about one-half of them go down to drunkard's\r\n     graves, and the other half are either dead or forgotten, while she\r\n     today stands as one of the brightest, cheeriest women, young or\r\n     old, to be found in our own or any other land. What a tremendous\r\n     battle she has fought, what a blameless life she has led, rejoicing\r\n     in the strength which enabled her to mingle with the weak and\r\n     erring of her sex when necessary without even the smell of smoke on\r\n     her garments. She made an address, and what an address it was, with\r\n     more good, sound, hard sense in it than you would find in fifty\r\n     congressional speeches, and how the women applauded her till they\r\n     made the roof ring! Susan B. Anthony was by all odds the lioness of\r\n     the day.\r\n\r\nA few days were given to Mrs. Stanton, who was spending the summer with\r\nher son Gerrit and his wife at Hempstead, L. I., and they prepared the\r\ncall for the next national convention. She reached home in time to speak\r\non September 9 at Wyoming, where she was a guest at the delightful\r\nsummer home of Mrs. Susan Look Avery for several days, as long as she\r\ncould be persuaded to stay. She then hastened back to New York to visit\r\nMrs. M. Louise Thomas, president of Sorosis, for a day or two, and\r\narrange National Council affairs, and down to Philadelphia to plan\r\nsuffrage work with Rachel Foster Avery.[50] Just as she was leaving she\r\nreceived a letter from Margaret V. Hamilton, of Ft. Wayne, announcing\r\nthat her mother, Emerine J. Hamilton, had bequeathed to Miss Anthony for\r\nher personal use $500 in bank stock, a testimonial of her twenty years\r\nof unwavering friendship. While grieved at the loss of one whose love\r\nand hospitality she had so long enjoyed, she rejoiced in the thought\r\nthat from the daughters she still would receive both in the same\r\nunstinted degree.\r\n\r\nSeptember 27 saw her en route for the West once more and by October 1\r\nshe was at Wichita, ready for the Kansas State Convention. The Woman's\r\nTribune had said: \"It is the greatest boon to the president of a State\r\nconvention to have the presence and counsel of Miss Anthony.\" At this\r\nmeeting the committee reported a set of resolutions beginning, \"We\r\nbelieve in God,\" etc., when she at once protested on the ground that\r\n\"the woman suffrage platform must be kept free from all theological\r\nbias, so that unbelievers as well as evangelical Christians can stand\r\nupon it.\"\r\n\r\nThe 10th of October Miss Anthony, fresh, bright and cheery, reported for\r\nduty at the Indiana State Convention held at Rushville. On October 14,\r\nstrong and vigorous as ever, she announced herself at Milwaukee, ready\r\nfor the Wisconsin State Convention, where she spoke at each of the three\r\ndays' sessions. In one of her addresses here she said that she did not\r\nask suffrage for women in order that they might vote against the liquor\r\ntraffic--she did not know how they would vote on this question--she\r\nsimply demanded that they should have the same right as men to express\r\ntheir opinions at the ballot-box. Immediately the report was sent\r\nbroadcast that Miss Anthony had said \"as many women would vote for beer\r\nas against it.\"\r\n\r\nThen down to Chicago she journeyed to talk over the \"Isabella Memorial\"\r\nwith her cousin, Dr. Frances Dickinson, who was a prime factor of this\r\nmovement. While there she had a charming visit with Harriet Hosmer, the\r\ngreat sculptor, who afterwards wrote her:\r\n\r\n     It was a real treat to see you once more.... How well do I remember\r\n     our first meeting in the office of The Revolution. I do not know of\r\n     anything that would give me so much pleasure as being present at\r\n     the Washington convention, and if I am in America next January you\r\n     may rest assured I shall be there.... Yes, you are quite right;\r\n     there ought to be a National Art Association of women who are real\r\n     artists, and it would be a good thing all round. There is nothing\r\n     which has impressed me so much and so favorably since my return\r\n     here as the number of helpful clubs and associations which are of\r\n     modern growth, and one of the best fruits of the work that has been\r\n     done among women. Not only are they full of pleasantness but where\r\n     unity is there is strength.\r\n\r\n     Now that we have come together, don't let us permit a vacuum of\r\n     twenty years to intervene again; we have a great deal to say to\r\n     each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Keep me in your heart as I keep you in mine\r\nand hold me even [illegible] H. Hosmer.\"]\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony went from Milwaukee to the Minnesota State Convention at\r\nMinneapolis, and addressed the students of the university. She also\r\nvisited the Bethany Home for the Friendless and writes in her journal:\r\n\"I saw there over forty fatherless babes, and twenty or thirty girls who\r\nmust henceforth wear the scarlet letter over their hearts, while the men\r\nwho caused their ruin go forth to seek new recruits for the Bethany\r\nhomes!\" At Duluth she was the guest of her faithful friends, Judge J. B.\r\nand Sarah Burger Stearns, speaking here in the Masonic Temple. The judge\r\nintroduced Miss Anthony in these words: \"The first quality we look for\r\nin men is courage; the next, ability; the third, benevolence. It is my\r\npleasure to present to you tonight a woman who has exhibited, in a\r\nmarked degree, all three.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 11, 1889, at the beginning of the northern winter, she went\r\nfrom here to South Dakota. A woman suffrage amendment had been submitted\r\nto be voted on in 1890, and Miss Anthony had been receiving urgent\r\nletters from the members of the State Suffrage Association to assist\r\nthem in a preliminary canvass and advise as to methods of organization,\r\netc. \"Every true woman will welcome you to South Dakota,\" wrote Philena\r\nJohnson, one of the district presidents. \"My wife looks upon you as a\r\ndependent child upon an indulgent parent; your words will inspire her,\"\r\nwrote the husband of Emma Smith DeVoe, the State lecturer. \"We are very\r\ngrateful that you will come to us,\" wrote Alonzo Wardall, the\r\nvice-president.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony began the canvass at Redfield, November 12, introduced by\r\nJudge Isaac Howe. The Supreme Court decision allowing \"original\r\npackages\" of liquor to come into the State had just been announced, and\r\nthe old minister who opened this meeting devoted all of his prayer to\r\nexplaining to the Almighty the evils which would follow in the wake of\r\nthese \"original packages!\" She held meetings throughout the State, had\r\nfine audiences and found strong friends at each place. There was much\r\npublic interest and the comments of the press were favorable in the\r\nhighest degree.[51]\r\n\r\nShe addressed the Farmers' Alliance at their State convention in\r\nAberdeen; they were very cordial and officially endorsed the suffrage\r\namendment. In a letter at this time she said: \"I have learned just what\r\nI feared--the Prohibitionists in their late campaign studiously held\r\nwoman suffrage in the background. The W. C. T. U. woman who introduced\r\nme last night publicly proclaimed she had not yet reached woman\r\nsuffrage. Isn't it discouraging? When I get to Washington, I shall see\r\nall of the South Dakota congressmen and senators and learn what they\r\nintend to do. The Republican party here stood for prohibition, and if it\r\nwill stand for woman suffrage we can carry it, and not otherwise.\" Her\r\nfine optimism did not desert her, however, and to the Woman's Tribune\r\nshe wrote:\r\n\r\n     I want to help our friends throughout this State to hold the\r\n     canvass for woman suffrage entirely outside all political,\r\n     religious or reform questions--that is, keep it absolutely by\r\n     itself. I advise every man and woman who wishes this amendment\r\n     carried at the ballot-box next November to wear only the badge of\r\n     yellow ribbon--that and none other. This morning I cut and tied a\r\n     whole bolt of ribbon, and every woman went out of the court-house\r\n     adorned with a little sunflower-colored knot.\r\n\r\n     The one work for the winter before our good friends in South\r\n     Dakota, should be that of visiting every farmhouse of every school\r\n     district of every county in the State; talking and reading over the\r\n     question at every fireside these long evenings; enrolling the names\r\n     of all who believe in woman suffrage; leaving papers and tracts to\r\n     be read and circulated, and organizing equal suffrage committees in\r\n     every district and village. With this done, the entire State will\r\n     be in splendid trim for the opening of the regular campaign in the\r\n     spring of 1890.\r\n\r\nShe started eastward the very day her canvass ended, reaching Chicago on\r\nThanksgiving evening, and went directly to Detroit where she spoke\r\nNovember 29, and was the guest of her old friends of anti-slavery days,\r\nGiles and Catharine F. Stebbins. Her nephew, Daniel R. Jr., came over\r\nfrom Michigan University to hear her and accompanied her back to Ann\r\nArbor, where she was entertained by Mrs. Olivia B. Hall. He thus gives\r\nhis impressions to his parents:\r\n\r\n     Aunt Susan spoke here for the benefit of the Ladies, Library\r\n     Association, and had an excellent audience; and Sunday night she\r\n     spoke at the Unitarian church. It was jammed full and people were\r\n     in line for half a block around, trying to get inside. At the\r\n     beginning of her lecture Aunt Susan does not do so well; but when\r\n     she is in the midst of her argument and all her energies brought\r\n     into play, I think she is a very powerful speaker.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Sunderland, the Unitarian minister, invited her to dinner and,\r\n     as I was her nephew, of course I had to be included. The Halls are\r\n     very fine people and as I took nearly every meal at their house\r\n     while she was here, I can also testify that they have good things\r\n     to eat. I brought Aunt Susan down to see where I lived. It being\r\n     vacation time of course the house was closed and hadn't been aired\r\n     for a week, and some of the boys having smoked a good deal she\r\n     thought the odor was dreadful, but that otherwise we were very\r\n     comfortably fixed.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony spoke at Toronto December 2, introduced by the mayor and\r\nentertained by Dr. Augusta S. Gullen, daughter of Dr. Emily H. Stowe.\r\nShe addressed the Political Equality Club of Rochester in the\r\nUniversalist church, December 5. During the past three months she had\r\ntravelled several thousand miles and spoken every night when not on\r\nboard the cars. Three days later she started for Washington to arrange\r\nfor the National convention, and from there wrote Rachel Foster Avery:\r\n\r\n     I have done it, and to my dismay Mrs. Colby has announced my\r\n     high-handedness in this week's Tribune, when I intended to keep my\r\n     assumption of Andrew Jackson-like responsibility a secret. One\r\n     night last week the new Lincoln Hall was opened and when I saw what\r\n     a splendid audience-room it is, I just rushed the next day to the\r\n     agent and found our convention days not positively engaged; then\r\n     rushed to Mr. Kent and from him to Mr. Jordan and got released from\r\n     the little church, and then back I went and had the convention\r\n     booked for Lincoln Hall. I did not mean to have any notice of the\r\n     change of place go out over the country, because it makes no\r\n     difference to friends outside of Washington. Well, no matter. I\r\n     couldn't think of taking our convention into any church when we had\r\n     a chance to go back to our old home, and that in a new and elegant\r\n     house reared upon the ashes of the old. So if killed I am for this\r\n     high-handed piece of work, why killed I shall be!\r\n\r\nA letter will illustrate her efforts for South Dakota: \"I have 50,000\r\ncopies of Senator Palmer's speech ready to go to the Senate\r\nfolding-room, and thence to the South Dakota senators and\r\nrepresentatives to be franked, and then back to me to be addressed to\r\nthe 25,000 men of the Farmers' Alliance, etc. If suffrage literature\r\ndoes not penetrate into every single family in every town of every\r\ncounty of South Dakota before another month rolls round, it will be\r\nbecause I can not get the names of every one. I am securing also the\r\nsubscription lists of every county newspaper. If reading matter in every\r\nhome and lectures in every school house of the State will convert the\r\nmen, we shall carry South Dakota next November with a whoop! I do hope\r\nwe can galvanize our friends in every State to concentrate all their\r\nmoney and forces upon South Dakota the coming year. We must have no\r\nscattering fire now, but all directed to one point, and get everybody to\r\nthinking, reading and talking on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again she writes: \"With my $400 which I have contributed to the\r\nNational this year, I have made life members of myself, nieces Lucy E.\r\nand Louise, and Mrs. Stanton. Now I intend to make Mrs. Minor, Olympia\r\nBrown, Phoebe Couzins and Matilda Joslyn Gage life members. I had\r\nthought of others, but these last four are of longer standing, were\r\nidentified with the old National and have suffered odium and persecution\r\nbecause of adherence to it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the diary's mention of busy days is one item: \"Went to the Capitol to\r\nthe celebration of the centennial of the First Congress. Justice Fuller\r\nmade a beautiful oration on the progress of the century but failed to\r\nhave discovered a woman all the way down;\" and another: \"This morning\r\ncalled on Mrs. Harrison, Mrs. Stanford and Mrs. Manderson to talk about\r\nhaving women represented in the Columbian Exposition of 1892. All are in\r\nfavor of it.\"\r\n\r\nEvery hour was filled with business, and with social duties undertaken\r\nsolely because of the influence they might have on the great and only\r\nquestion. The last day of 1889 she went to pay the final honors to the\r\nwife of her faithful ally, Hon. A. G. Riddle. Death had robbed her of\r\nmany friends during the past year. On February 1 her old co-worker Amy\r\nPost, of Rochester, was laid to rest, one of the veteran Abolitionists\r\nwho commenced the work in 1833 with Garrison, and who had stood by the\r\ncause of woman as faithfully as by that of the slave. In March passed\r\naway in the prime of womanhood, Mary L. Booth, editor of Harper's Bazar\r\nfrom its beginning in 1867. In June died Maria Mitchell, the great\r\nastronomer, in the fullness of years, having completed threescore and\r\nten. In November was finished the work of Dinah Mendenhall, the\r\nvenerable Quaker and philanthropist, wife of Isaac Mendenhall, whose\r\nhome near Philadelphia had been for sixty years the refuge of the poor\r\nand oppressed, without regard to sex, color or creed.[52]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the old year, the Washington Star in a long interview,\r\nheaded \"A Leader of Women,\" said.\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony is now at the capital, ready for the regular annual\r\n     agitation before Congress of the proposed Sixteenth Amendment to\r\n     the Constitution. She is one of the remarkable women of the world.\r\n     In appearance she has not grown a day older in the past ten years.\r\n     Her manner has none of the excitement of an enthusiast; never\r\n     discouraged by disappointment, she keeps calmly at work, and she\r\n     could give points in political organization and management to some\r\n     of the best male politicians in the land. Her face is strong and\r\n     intellectual, but full of womanly gentleness. Her gold spectacles\r\n     give her a motherly rather than a severe expression, and a stranger\r\n     would see nothing incongruous in her doing knitting or fancy-work.\r\n     In no sense does she correspond with the distorted idea of a\r\n     woman's rights agitator. In conversation her manner is that of\r\n     perfect repose. She is always entertaining, and the most romantic\r\n     idealizer of women would not expect frivolity in one of her age and\r\n     would not charge it to strong-mindedness that she is sedate....\r\n     Speaking of the Columbus celebration, she said she understood it\r\n     was probable that the board of promotion at the capital would\r\n     decide to permit women a part in the organization and management of\r\n     the enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] In response to a letter of introduction from Mr. Spofford, of the\r\nRiggs, Miss Anthony was the guest of the Burnet House with a fine suite\r\nof apartments. In a letter home she writes: \"The chambermaid said, 'Why,\r\nyou have had more calls than Mrs. Hayes had when she occupied these\r\nrooms.'\"\r\n\r\n[47] Mrs. Minor managed this meeting and also tried to arrange for Miss\r\nAnthony to address a large Catholic gathering but was unsuccessful. She\r\nwrites: \"The vicar-general was on the side of your lecture and spoke in\r\ncomplimentary terms of you and your work.\"\r\n\r\n[48] In a letter Miss Thomson wrote: \"I want you to know that my heart\r\nis warmer for you than for any other mortal, my thoughts follow you\r\nwheresoever you go, and I am always glad when your footsteps turn toward\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n[49] A little incident showed the family spirit. When her lover was\r\nabout to present her with a handsome diamond engagement ring, she\r\nrequested that instead the money should be given to the National\r\nSuffrage Association, which was done.\r\n\r\n[50] In a letter to Mrs. Avery relative to some pressing work, Miss\r\nAnthony wrote: \"I would not for anything have you drudge on this during\r\nyour husband's vacation. No, no, there is none too much of life and\r\nhappiness for any of us, so plan to go and be and do whatever seemeth\r\nbest unto the twain made so beautifully one.\"\r\n\r\n[51] She spoke at Huron, Mitchell, Yankton, Sioux Falls, Madison,\r\nBrookings, DeSmet, Watertown, Parker, Pierre, St. Lawrence and Aberdeen,\r\nand presented a full set of the History of Woman Suffrage to libraries\r\nin each of these towns.\r\n\r\n[52] The year previous Mrs. Mendenhall had given Miss Anthony and\r\nFrances Willard each her note for $1,000 payable after her death, to be\r\nused for the cause of woman suffrage and temperance, but the heirs\r\nrefused to honor the notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nAT THE END OF SEVENTY YEARS.\r\n\r\n1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony received New Year's calls in the Red Parlor of the Riggs\r\nHouse, January 1, 1890, entertained a party of friends at dinner in the\r\nevening, and had the usual number of pleasant gifts and loving letters.\r\nWhile busy with preparations for the national convention, she learned of\r\nthe project to celebrate her seventieth birthday on February 15.\r\nSupposing it to be simply a tribute from her friends, like the\r\nobservance of her fiftieth anniversary twenty years before in New York,\r\nshe was pleased at the compliment, but after the arrangements were\r\ncommenced she learned that it was to take the form of an elegant banquet\r\nat the Riggs and tickets were to be sold at $4 each. Her feelings were\r\nexpressed in a letter to May Wright Sewall and Rachel Foster Avery, who\r\nhad the matter in charge:\r\n\r\n     I write in utter consternation, hoping it is not too late to recall\r\n     every notice sent for publication. I never dreamed of your doing\r\n     other than issuing pretty little private invitations signed by Mrs.\r\n     Stanton and yourselves as officers of the National Association. If\r\n     its official board is too far dissolved for this, please let the\r\n     whole matter drop, and I will invite a few special friends to sup\r\n     with me on my birthday. I know Mr. and Mrs. Spofford would love to\r\n     unite with you in a personal entertainment of this kind. I may be\r\n     wrong as to the bad taste of issuing a notice, just like a public\r\n     meeting, and letting those purchase tickets who wish; but it seems\r\n     to me the very persons least desired by us may be the first to buy\r\n     them. I should be proud of a banquet with invited guests who would\r\n     make it an honor, but with such persons as will pay $5, more or\r\n     less, it resolves itself into a mere matter of cash. I would vastly\r\n     prefer to ask those we wanted and foot the entire bill myself.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sewall wrote at once to Mrs. Avery, \"This letter strikes dismay to\r\nmy soul. I will share with you the expense of the banquet.\" In a day or\r\ntwo Miss Anthony's heart smote her and she wrote again: \"I have blown my\r\nbugle blast and I know I have wounded your dear souls, but I can not see\r\nthe plan a bit prettier than I did at first. I may be very stupid or\r\nsupersensitive. If it were to honor Mrs. Stanton, I would be willing to\r\ncharge for tickets.\" And then a few days later: \"Have I killed you\r\noutright? I can not tell you how much I have suffered because I can not\r\nsee this as you do, but I would rather never have a mention of my\r\nbirthday than to have it in that way. I know you meant it all lovely for\r\nme, but you did not look at it outside your own dear hearts. Do tell me\r\nthat I have not alienated the two best-beloved of all my girls.\"\r\n\r\nThey finally effected a compromise on the money feature by sending out\r\nhandsomely engraved invitations to those whom they wished as guests and\r\nletting them pay $4 a plate if they came. Although they proved to Miss\r\nAnthony that this always was done in such cases, she assented very\r\nunwillingly, and begged that they would ask the friends to contribute $4\r\napiece to the fund for South Dakota instead of the birthday banquet.\r\nFinally, when all her scruples had been overcome, she made out so long a\r\nlist of people whom she wished to have complimentary invitations that\r\nthey would have filled every seat in the dining hall. She also was so\r\nanxious that no one should be slighted in a chance to speak that Mrs.\r\nAvery wrote: \"The banquet would have to last through eternity to hear\r\nall those Miss Anthony thinks ought to be heard.\"\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the birthday over 200 of her distinguished friends\r\nwere seated in the great dining-room of the Riggs House, including a\r\ndelegation from Rochester and a number of relatives from Leavenworth,\r\nChicago, New York and Philadelphia. Miss Anthony occupied the place of\r\nhonor, on her right hand were Senator Blair and Mrs. Stanton; on her\r\nleft, Robert Purvis, Isabella Beecher Hooker and May Wright Sewall.\r\n(Mrs. Foster Avery was detained at home.) The room was beautifully\r\ndecorated and the repast elaborate, but with such an array of intellect,\r\nthe after-dinner speeches were the distinguishing feature of the\r\noccasion. The Washington Star, in a long account, said:\r\n\r\n     A company of the most remarkable women in the world were assembled.\r\n     As she sat there, surrounded by the skirted knights of her long\r\n     crusade, Miss Anthony looked no older than fifty, but she had got a\r\n     good start into her seventy-first year before the dinner ended. May\r\n     Wright Sewall presided. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, that venerable and\r\n     beautiful old stateswoman, sat at the right of Senator Blair,\r\n     looking as if she should be the Lord Chief-Justice, with her white\r\n     hair puffed all over her head, and her amiable and intellectual\r\n     face marked with the lines of wisdom. Isabella Beecher Hooker, who\r\n     reminds one of her great brother, with the stamp of genius on her\r\n     brow and an energy of intellect expressed upon her face, sat at the\r\n     left of Miss Anthony. Old John Hutchinson, the last of the famous\r\n     singing family, his white hair and beard forming a fringe about his\r\n     shoulders; Clara Barton, her breast sparkling with Red Cross\r\n     medals; and many other women of wide fame were present. Before the\r\n     banquet the guests assembled in the Red Parlor of the Riggs, where\r\n     a levee was held and congratulations were offered. It was after 10\r\n     o'clock when the line was formed and the guests marched down to the\r\n     dining-room, Miss Anthony, on the arm of Senator Blair, leading the\r\n     way.\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the New York Sun said in a brilliant description:\r\n\"The dining-room was a splendid scene, long to be remembered. The\r\nAmerican flag was everywhere and, with tropical flowers and foliage,\r\nmade bright decorations.... It was a notable gathering of women\r\nworld-wide in fame, and of distinguished men. The lady with a\r\nbirthday--seventy of them indeed--was of course the star on which all\r\nothers gazed. She never looked better, never happier, and never so much\r\nlike breaking down before her feelings. No wonder, with such a birthday\r\nparty! Friends of her youth calling her 'Susan,' affectionate deference\r\nfrom everybody, and all saying she deserved a thousand just such\r\nbirthdays--young in heart, beautiful in spirit.\"\r\n\r\nPhoebe Couzins replied to the toast \"St. Susan,\" making a witty contrast\r\nbetween the austere St. Anthony of old and the St. Anthony of today,\r\nrepresenting self-abnegation for the good, the beautiful, the true. Rev.\r\nAnna Shaw made a delightfully humorous response to \"The Modern\r\nPeripatetic,\" referring to the ancient philosopher who had founded the\r\nschool of men, and Miss Anthony who had founded the modern school of\r\nwomen peripatetics, ready to grab their grips and start around the world\r\nat a moment's notice. Matilda Joslyn Gage responded to \"Miss Anthony as\r\na Fellow-worker;\" Clara Bewick Colby to \"Miss Anthony as a Journalist;\"\r\nLaura Ormiston Chant, of England, to \"American Womanhood;\" Mrs. Jane\r\nMarsh Parker, sent by the Ignorance Club of Rochester, to \"Miss Anthony\r\nat Home,\" beginning: \"To have brought to Miss Anthony all the\r\ntestimonials which Rochester would have laid at her feet tonight would\r\nhave made me appear at the banquet like the modern Santa Claus--the\r\npostman at Christmastide.\" Rev. Frederick W. Hinckley, of Providence,\r\nbegan his graceful address by saying:\r\n\r\n     King Arthur, sword in hand, is not at the head of the table, but\r\n     Queen Susan is, the silver crown of seventy honorable years upon\r\n     her brow; and we gather here from every quarter of the Union,\r\n     little knights and great knights, without distinction of sex, to\r\n     take anew at her hands the oath of loyal service to the cause of\r\n     universal liberty. Those of us who have followed her through all\r\n     these years know that she has been a knight without reproach, that\r\n     her head has been level and her heart true. Faithful to the cause\r\n     of her sex, she has been broad enough to grasp great general\r\n     principles. She has been not only an advocate of equal rights, but\r\n     the prophet of humanity; and a better advocate of equal rights\r\n     because a prophet of humanity. There never has been a time when\r\n     Whittier's lines concerning Sumner would not have been applicable\r\n     to her:\r\n\r\n              \"Wherever wrong doth right deny,\r\n                 Or suffering spirits urge their plea,\r\n              Here is a voice to smite the lie,\r\n                 A hand to set the captive free.\"\r\n\r\n     Nineteenth century chivalry renders all honor to that type of\r\n     womanhood of which she is an illustrious example.\r\n\r\nRobert Purvis eloquently referred to Miss Anthony's grand work for the\r\nabolition of slavery, which, he said, was still continued in the vaster\r\nand more complicated work for the freedom of women. Mrs. Stanton's two\r\ndaughters, Mrs. Lawrence and Mrs. Blatch, made sparkling responses.\r\nRepresentative J. A. Pickler said in part:\r\n\r\n     Five years since, when a member of the Dakota legislature and in\r\n     charge of the bill giving full suffrage to women, I was\r\n     characterized in the public press as \"Susan B. Pickler.\" I look\r\n     upon this as one of the greatest honors ever bestowed upon me. I\r\n     have never learned how Miss Anthony regarded it....\r\n\r\n     Unswerved by the shafts of ridicule, without love of gain, she has\r\n     sublimely borne through all these years ridicule and reproach for\r\n     principle, for humanity, for womanhood. The soldier battles amid\r\n     the plaudits of his countrymen, the statesman supported by his\r\n     party, the clergyman sanctioned by his church, but alone, this\r\n     great woman has stood for half a century, contending for the rights\r\n     of women. Says Professor Swing: \"Mark any life pervaded by a worthy\r\n     plan, and how beautiful it is! Webster, Gladstone, Sumner,\r\n     Disraeli; fifty years were these temples in the building!\" How\r\n     aptly these words describe our great advocate of woman. Gratifying\r\n     it must be to Susan B. Anthony; gratifying, we bear witness, it is\r\n     to her friends, that in her maturer years we see this cause, long\r\n     hated by others but by her always loved, now respected by all; and\r\n     herself, its representative and exponent, revered, loved and\r\n     honored by a whole nation.\r\n\r\nThe main address was made by Mrs. Stanton, who responded to the\r\nsentiment \"The Friendships of Women,\" in an oration full of humor, and\r\nclosed:\r\n\r\n     If there is one part of my life which gives me more intense\r\n     satisfaction than another, it is my friendship of more than forty\r\n     years' standing with Susan B. Anthony. Ours has been a friendship\r\n     of hard work and self-denial.... Emerson says, \"It is better to be\r\n     a thorn in the side of your friend than his echo.\" If this add\r\n     weight and stability to friendship, then ours will endure forever,\r\n     for we have indeed been thorns in the side of each other. Sub rosa,\r\n     dear friends, I have had no peace for forty years, since the day we\r\n     started together on the suffrage expedition in search of woman's\r\n     place in the National Constitution. She has kept me on the war-path\r\n     at the point of the bayonet so long that I have often wished my\r\n     untiring coadjutor might, like Elijah, be translated a few years\r\n     before I was summoned, that I might spend the sunset of my life in\r\n     some quiet chimney-corner and lag superfluous on the stage no\r\n     longer.\r\n\r\n     After giving up all hope of her sweet repose in Abraham's bosom, I\r\n     sailed some years ago for Europe. With an ocean between us I said,\r\n     now I shall enjoy a course of light reading. I shall visit all the\r\n     wonders of the old world, and write no more calls, resolutions or\r\n     speeches for conventions--when lo! one day I met Susan face to face\r\n     in the streets of London with a new light in her eyes. Behold there\r\n     were more worlds to conquer. She had decided on an international\r\n     council in Washington, so I had to return with her to the scenes of\r\n     our conflict.... Well, I prefer a tyrant of my own sex, so I shall\r\n     not deny the patent fact of my subjection; for I do believe that I\r\n     have developed into much more of a woman under her jurisdiction,\r\n     fed on statute laws and constitutional amendments, than if left to\r\n     myself reading novels in an easy-chair, lost in sweet reveries of\r\n     the golden age to come without any effort of my own.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Stanton concluded, \"The Guest of the Evening\" was announced and,\r\namidst long continued applause and waving of handkerchiefs, Miss Anthony\r\narose and made one of those little speeches that never can be reported,\r\nin which she said:\r\n\r\n     I have been half inclined while listening here to believe that I\r\n     had passed on to the beyond. If there is one thing I hope for more\r\n     than another, it is that, should I stay on this planet thirty years\r\n     longer, I still may be worthy of the wonderful respect you have\r\n     manifested for me tonight. The one thought I wish to express is how\r\n     little my friend or I could have accomplished alone. What she said\r\n     is true; I have been a thorn in her side and in that of her family\r\n     too, I fear. I never expect to know any joy in this world equal to\r\n     that of going up and down the land, getting good editorials\r\n     written, engaging halls, and circulating Mrs. Stanton's speeches.\r\n     If I ever have had any inspiration she has given it to me, for I\r\n     never could have done my work if I had not had this woman at my\r\n     right hand. If I had had a husband and children, or opposition in\r\n     my own home, I never could have done it. My father and mother, my\r\n     brothers and sisters, those who are gone and those who are left,\r\n     all have been a help to me. How much depends on the sympathy and\r\n     co-operation of those about us! It is not necessary for all to go\r\n     to the front. Every woman presiding over her table in the homes\r\n     where I have been, has helped sustain me, I wish they could know\r\n     how much.\r\n\r\nPoems were read or sent by Harriet Hosmer, Elizabeth Boynton Harbert,\r\nAlice Williams Brotherton and a number of others. At the close of Mrs.\r\nHooker's verses entitled \"Should Auld Acquaintance be Forgot?\" the\r\nentire company arose and sang two stanzas of \"Auld Lang Syne,\" led by\r\nthe venerable John Hutchinson. From the many letters received only a few\r\nextracts can be given:\r\n\r\n     Allow me to congratulate you on your safe arrival at the age of\r\n     threescore and ten. How much we may congratulate ourselves on the\r\n     great gains that have come to woman during these years; gains for\r\n     which you have worked so hard and so long! Hoping that you may\r\n     still be on this planet when the ballot is the sure possession of\r\n     our sex, I am very truly your co-worker,\r\n\r\n                                             LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     None can more heartily congratulate thee on thy threescore and ten\r\n     years nobly devoted to the welfare of humanity, to unremitting\r\n     labor for temperance, for the abolition of slavery and for equal\r\n     rights of citizenship, irrespective of sex or color. We have lived\r\n     to see the end of slavery, and I hope thou wilt live to see\r\n     prohibition enforced in every State in the Union, and sex no longer\r\n     the condition of citizenship. God bless thee and give thee many\r\n     more years made happy by works of love and duty. I am truly thy\r\n     friend,\r\n\r\n                                             JOHN G. WHITTIER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"John G Whittier\"]\r\n\r\n     My heart honors, loves and blesses you. Every woman's would if she\r\n     only knew you. You'll have a statue some day in the Capitol at\r\n     Washington, but your best monument is built already in your\r\n     countrywomen's hearts. God bless you, brave and steadfast elder\r\n     sister! Accept this as the only valentine I ever wrote. May you\r\n     live a hundred years and vote the last twenty-five, is the wish and\r\n     prediction of your loyal sister,\r\n\r\n                                             FRANCES E. WILLARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony's sole and effective fidelity to the cause of the\r\n     equal rights of her sex is worthy of the highest honor, and I know\r\n     that it will be eloquently and fitly acknowledged at the dinner,\r\n     which I trust will be in every way successful. Very respectfully\r\n     yours,\r\n\r\n                                             GEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     It is a grief to me that I can not be present to honor the birthday\r\n     of our dear Susan B. Anthony; long life to her! I should have been\r\n     delighted to respond to the toast proposed, and to bear my\r\n     heartfelt tribute of respect and love for the true and unselfish\r\n     reformer, to whom women are no more indebted than are men. \"Time\r\n     shall embalm and magnify her name.\" Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                             WM. LLOYD GARRISON.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I know her great earnestness in every righteous cause, especially\r\n     that most righteous of all, woman suffrage, which I hope may\r\n     receive a new impulse from your gathering. As I grow older I feel\r\n     assured, year by year, that the granting of suffrage to women will\r\n     remedy many evils which now are attendant on popular government;\r\n     and if we are to despair of that cause we must despair of the final\r\n     establishment of justice as the controlling power in the political\r\n     affairs of mankind. I am faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                             GEORGE F. HOAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours Sincerely, T B Reed\"]\r\n\r\n     I can not venture to promise to be present at the dinner to be\r\n     given to Miss Anthony, but I should be sorry to lose an opportunity\r\n     to express my admiration of her life and character. In themselves\r\n     they are ample refutation of the charges made by the unthinking\r\n     that participation in public affairs would make women unwomanly. If\r\n     any system of subjection has enabled any woman to preserve more\r\n     thoroughly the respect and affectionate regard of all her friends\r\n     than has Miss Anthony amid the struggles of an active and\r\n     strenuous life I have yet to learn of it. With sincere hope that\r\n     she may have many years still left to her, I am yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                             THOMAS B. REED.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I think I express the feeling of most if not all the workers in our\r\n     cause when I say that the women of America owe more to Susan B.\r\n     Anthony than to any other woman living. While Mrs. Stanton has been\r\n     the standard bearer of liberty, announcing great principles, Miss\r\n     Anthony has been the power which has carried those principles on\r\n     toward victory and impressed them upon the hearts of the people.\r\n     Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                             OLYMPIA BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n     May you live many years longer to enjoy the results of your\r\n     herculean work, and score as many triumphs in the future as you\r\n     have in the past. On the morning of the 15th some flowers will be\r\n     sent you with my love. I wish they were as imperishable as your\r\n     name and fame. Affectionately,\r\n\r\n                                             MRS. JOHN A.

Truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                        W. C.

W. PALMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     My wife and I send you our hearty congratulations on your birthday.\r\n     May you have many happy returns of the day, with increasing honor\r\n     and affection from your numerous friends, amongst whom we hope you\r\n     will let us count ourselves. Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                             CHARLES NORDHOFF.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I congratulate you with all my heart upon your health and happiness\r\n     on this your seventieth birthday, and wish to say that I believe no\r\n     woman lives in the United States who has done more for her sex, and\r\n     for ours as well, than yourself. The great advancement of women,\r\n     not alone in the direction of suffrage, but in every field of labor\r\n     and every department of the better and nobler life of manhood and\r\n     womanhood, during the past generation, has sprung from the work\r\n     which you inaugurated years ago. Mrs. Carpenter joins me in\r\n     congratulations and good wishes. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                                             FRANK G. CARPENTER.\r\n\r\nCordial greetings were received from Neal Dow and Senator Dawes, and\r\nletters and telegrams came from distinguished individuals and societies\r\nin every State and from many foreign countries. Over 200 of these are\r\npreserved among other mementoes of this occasion. Among the telegrams\r\nwere these, representing the great labor organization of the country:\r\n\r\n     We congratulate you on the seventieth anniversary of a useful and\r\n     successful life. May you enjoy many years of health and happiness.\r\n\r\n                                   HANNAH POWDERLY, T. V. POWDERLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     May your noble, self-sacrificing life be spared to participate in\r\n     your heart's dearest wish--woman's full emancipation.\r\n\r\n                         LEONORA M. BARRY, _Grand Organizer K. of L._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Faithfully yours, Clara Bewick Colby.\"]\r\n\r\nMrs. Colby issued a birthday edition of the Woman's Tribune containing a\r\nhistory of Miss Anthony's trial, a fine biographical sketch written by\r\nherself and many beautiful tributes from other friends, among them this\r\nfrom Laura M. Johns: \"Always to efface herself and her own interests and\r\nto put the cause to the fore; to be striving to place a crown upon some\r\nother brow; to be receiving and giving, but never retaining; ever\r\nenriching the work but never herself; to be busy through weariness and\r\ndifficulty and resting only in a change of labor; to bear the stinging\r\nhail of ridicule which fell on this movement, and to receive with\r\nsurprised tears the flowers that bloomed in her thorny path; to be in\r\nthe heat of the noonday harvest field at seventy, with years of activity\r\nand usefulness still remaining to add to her glorious life and crown it\r\nwith such dignity as belongs to few--this is the story of Susan B.\r\nAnthony.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony carried in her arms seventy pink carnations with the card,\r\n\"For she's the pink o' womankind and blooms without a peer,\" from Miss\r\nCummings, of Washington. Flowers were sent in profusion, and there was\r\nno end of lovely little remembrances of jewelry, water colors, books,\r\nportfolios, card cases, handkerchiefs, fans, satin souvenirs,\r\nfancy-work, the gifts of loving women in all parts of the country.[53]\r\nThe evening was one of the proudest and happiest of a life which,\r\nalthough filled with toil and hardship, had been brightened, as had that\r\nof few other women, with the bountiful tributes and testimonials not\r\nonly of personal friends but of people in all parts of the world who\r\nknew of her only through her work for humanity. The next day she sat\r\ndown to Sunday dinner at a table which, thanks to Mrs. Spofford's\r\nthoughtfulness, had been arranged especially for the occasion,\r\nsurrounded by twenty-five of her own relatives who had come to\r\nWashington to celebrate her birthday.\r\n\r\nAmong many newspaper editorials upon this celebration, an extract from\r\nthe Boston Traveller, which bears the impress of the gifted Lilian\r\nWhiting, may be taken as an example of the general sentiment:\r\n\r\n     Without any special relay of theories on the subject, Miss Susan B.\r\n     Anthony discovered early in life the secret of imperishable youth\r\n     and constantly increasing happiness--a secret that may be\r\n     translated as personal devotion to a noble purpose. To devote one's\r\n     self to something higher than self--this is the answer of the ages\r\n     to those who would find the source of immortal energy and\r\n     enjoyment. It is a statement very simply and easily made but\r\n     involving all the philosophy of life. Miss Anthony recognized it\r\n     intuitively. She translated it into action with little\r\n     consciousness of its value as a theory; but it is the one deepest\r\n     truth in existence, and one which every human soul must sometime or\r\n     somewhere learn.\r\n\r\n     On February 15, 1820, when Susan B. Anthony was born, Emerson was a\r\n     youth of seventeen; Henry Ward Beecher was a child of seven and\r\n     Harriet Beecher Stowe a year his junior; Wendell Phillips was nine,\r\n     Whittier thirteen, and Wm. Lloyd Garrison fifteen years of age.\r\n     Elizabeth Cady Stanton was four years old, and Lucy Stone, Julia\r\n     Ward Howe and James Russell Lowell were Miss Anthony's predecessors\r\n     in this world only by one or two years. Margaret Fuller was ten,\r\n     Abraham Lincoln was eleven, and thus, between 1803-20, inclusive,\r\n     were born a remarkable group of people--a galaxy whose influence on\r\n     their century has been unequalled in any age or in any country,\r\n     since that of Pericles and his associates in the golden age of\r\n     Greece. It is only now, as the work of these immortals begins to\r\n     assume something of the definite outline of completeness; as some\r\n     results of the determining forces for which this great galaxy has\r\n     stood, begin to be discerned, that we can adequately recognize how\r\n     important to the century their lives have been. There are\r\n     undoubtedly high spirits sent to earth with a definite service to\r\n     render to their age and generation; a service that prepares the way\r\n     for the next ascending round on the great cycle of progress, and it\r\n     is no exaggeration to say that Susan B. Anthony is one of these....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"I am always faithfully yours, Lilian\r\nWhiting.\"]\r\n\r\nEven brief quotations must be omitted for want of space, but this from\r\nthe Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, Charles E. Fitch, editor, is\r\nentitled to a place as the sentiment in the city where Miss Anthony had\r\nmade her home for nearly half a century:\r\n\r\n     The occasion is a notable one. It is in honor of one of the noblest\r\n     women of her time. The day is past when Susan B. Anthony is met\r\n     with ridicule. She is honored everywhere. Consistent earnestness\r\n     will, at the last if not at the first, command respect. Slowly but\r\n     surely, Miss Anthony has won that respect from her countrymen. The\r\n     cause of the emancipation of women, for which she has labored so\r\n     long and so zealously, is not yet triumphant, nor is it probable\r\n     that she will live to see woman suffrage the rule of the land; but\r\n     at threescore years and ten, she may freely cherish the faith that\r\n     it is a conquering cause, destined some day to be vindicated in the\r\n     organic law of the separate American commonwealths and the Federal\r\n     union.\r\n\r\n     But it is not alone for the service which Miss Anthony has rendered\r\n     to the cause of woman suffrage that she is highly honored. She is\r\n     honored because of her womanhood, because she has ever been brave\r\n     without conceit and earnest without pretense, because she has the\r\n     heart to sympathize with suffering humanity in its various phases,\r\n     and the will to redress human wrongs. She has revealed a true\r\n     nobility of soul, and has ever been patient under abuse and\r\n     misrepresentation. She has allied herself with all good causes, and\r\n     has been the friend of those struggling against the dominion of\r\n     appetite as well as of those who have sought to free themselves\r\n     from political thralldom. She has earned the esteem even of those\r\n     who were diametrically opposed to her views. Within the movements\r\n     which she has urged, she has been an administrator rather than an\r\n     orator, although on occasions her speech has been informed with\r\n     the eloquence of conviction. In private life she has constrained\r\n     affection by a gentleness with which the world would hardly credit\r\n     her; but those who best know her, best know also the gracious\r\n     womanhood which illustrates itself in acts of unselfishness and\r\n     beneficence.\r\n\r\nThe birthday was celebrated by individuals and clubs in many states with\r\nluncheons, teas, receptions and literary entertainments. After all these\r\npleasant happenings, Miss Anthony felt new courage and hope to enter\r\nupon the Twenty-second National Suffrage Convention, February 18, at\r\nLincoln Music Hall. This was to be an important meeting, as it was to\r\nconsummate the union of the National and American organizations, and she\r\nwas anxious for a large attendance. \"Do come,\" she wrote to the most\r\ninfluential friends, \"if you stay away forever afterwards. This will be\r\nthe crucial test whether our platform shall continue broad and free as\r\nit has been for forty years. Some now propose secession because it is to\r\nbe narrow and bigoted; others left us twenty years ago because it was\r\ntoo liberal. Some of the prominent women are writing me that the union\r\nmeans we shall be no more than an annex to the W. C. T. U. hereafter;\r\nothers declare we are going to sink our identity and become sectarian\r\nand conservative. There is not the slightest ground for any of these\r\nfears, but come and be our stay and support.\"\r\n\r\nShe also had the annual struggle to secure the presence of Mrs. Stanton,\r\nwho was about to sail with her daughter for England, but, after the\r\nusual stormy correspondence, the day of departure was postponed and she\r\nwrote: \"You will have me under your thumb the first of February.\" As her\r\ntime was limited, Miss Anthony arranged for the hearing before the\r\nSenate committee on February 8, which was held in the new room assigned\r\nto the committee on woman suffrage. A few days later the ladies spoke\r\nbefore the House Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\nThe union of the two organizations was effected before the opening of\r\nthe convention and Mrs. Stanton elected president.[54] She faced a\r\nbrilliant assemblage at the opening of the National-American Convention\r\nand made one of the ablest speeches of her life, stating in the first\r\nsentence that she considered it a greater honor to go to England as the\r\npresident of this association than to be sent as minister\r\nplenipotentiary to any court in Europe. She closed by introducing her\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Stanton Blatch, who captivated the audience.[55] Hon. Wm.\r\nDudley Foulke, ex-president of the American Association, then delivered\r\nan eloquent and scholarly address. At its close Mrs. Stanton was obliged\r\nto leave, as she sailed for Europe the next morning. When she arose to\r\nsay farewell the entire audience joined in the waving of handkerchiefs,\r\nthe clapping of hands, and the men in three rousing cheers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Wm D Youlke\"]\r\n\r\nThe usual corps of National speakers received a notable addition in Wm.\r\nLloyd Garrison, Julia Ward Howe, Henry B. Blackwell, Carrie Chapman\r\nCatt, Hon. J. A. Pickler and Alice Stone Blackwell. Lucy Stone, being\r\ndetained at home by illness, sent a letter of greeting. When Miss\r\nAnthony, as vice-president-at-large, took the chair after Mrs. Stanton's\r\ndeparture, a great bouquet of white lilies was presented to her.\r\n\r\nA woman suffrage amendment was pending in South Dakota, and the claims\r\nof the new State were presented by Representative and Mrs. Pickler and\r\nAlonzo Wardall, secretary of the Farmer's Alliance and vice-president of\r\nthe suffrage association, all of whom felt confident that with financial\r\nhelp the amendment could be carried but, as the State was poor, most of\r\nthis would have to come from outside. The convention became very\r\nenthusiastic and a South Dakota campaign committee was formed; Susan B.\r\nAnthony, chairman, Clara B. Colby, Alice Stone Blackwell. Rev. Anna H.\r\nShaw made a stirring appeal for money. Miss Anthony pledged all that she\r\ncould raise between then and the November election. Mrs. Clara L.\r\nMcAdow, of Montana, headed the list with $250. A number of ladies\r\nfollowed with pledges for their respective States. In a short time it\r\nseemed evident that a large sum could be raised and, at Miss Anthony's\r\nrequest, the association directed all contributions to be sent to its\r\ntreasurer, Mrs. Spofford, at Washington, and she herself agreed to\r\ndevote a year's work to Dakota.[56]\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony remained in Washington several weeks, looking after various\r\nmatters: first of all, a representation of women in the management of\r\nthe Columbian Exposition; then there were the reports of the Senate and\r\nthe House committees, upon which she always brought to bear as much as\r\npossible of that \"indirect influence\" which women are said to possess.\r\nJust now the admission of Wyoming as a State with woman suffrage in its\r\nconstitution was hanging in the balance, but on March 26 she had the\r\ninexpressible pleasure of witnessing, from her seat in the gallery of\r\nthe House, the final discussion and passage of the bill.[57] She also\r\nwas arranging for the incorporation of the National-American\r\nAssociation, the old National, which had been a corporate body for a\r\nnumber of years, having added American to its name. The bills of the\r\nconvention were to be settled,[58] and there were still other subjects\r\nclaiming her attention before she started for the far West to inaugurate\r\nthe South Dakota campaign.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was a welcome guest at dinners and receptions in the homes\r\nof many of the dignitaries in Washington, but accepted these invitations\r\nonly when she saw an opportunity thereby to further the cause of woman\r\nsuffrage. She realized fully that one important step in the work was to\r\ninterest women of influence, socially and financially, and the high\r\nplane of respectability which this question had now attained was at\r\nleast partly due to her winters in Washington, where, at the Riggs House\r\nand in society, she met and made friends with prominent men and women\r\nfrom all parts of the country and converted them to her doctrines, which\r\nthey disseminated in their various localities upon returning home.\r\n\r\nShe writes her sister, in describing social events, of a dinner at the\r\nhandsome home of John R. McLean, owner of the Cincinnati Enquirer, who\r\nin person brought the invitation, while his wife, the daughter of\r\nGeneral Beale, looked after her \"as if she had been the Queen of Sheba.\"\r\nHere she met Senator and Mrs. Payne of Ohio, Senator and Mrs. Cockrell\r\nof Missouri, Senator and Mrs. Butler of South Carolina, Speaker and Mrs.\r\nReed of Maine, Justice and Mrs. Field and other notables. Then she\r\nspeaks of a meeting of the Cobweb Club, composed of women in official\r\nlife, where, at the close of her informal talk, they crowded around her\r\nand exclaimed: \"Why, Miss Anthony, we never understood this question\r\nbefore; of course we believe in it.\" Mrs. Hearst, wife of the Senator,\r\nsaid: \"Had any one ever presented this subject to me as you have done\r\ntoday, you should have had my help long ago.\" \"And so you see,\" she\r\nwrites, \"that at this juncture of our movement much could be\r\naccomplished by accepting such invitations, but it costs me more courage\r\nthan to face an audience of a thousand people.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Anthony was still in Washington she sat for her bust by a\r\nyoung sculptor, Adelaide Johnson. \"So marble and canvas both are to tell\r\nthe story,\" she wrote, \"for I have sat also for a painting. The time\r\ndraws near when I must start out campaigning and O, how I dread it!\"\r\nDuring this winter she received an invitation from a State W. C. T. U.\r\nto bring a suffrage convention to their city and they would bear the\r\nexpenses, stipulating only that she herself should be present, and that\r\n\"no speaker should say anything which would seem like an attack on\r\nChristianity.\" She wrote Miss Shaw: \"Won't that prevent your going, Rev.\r\nAnna? I wonder if they'll be as particular to warn all other speakers\r\nnot to say anything which shall sound like an attack on liberal\r\nreligion. They never seem to think we have any feelings to be hurt when\r\nwe have to sit under their reiteration of orthodox cant and dogma. The\r\nboot is all on one foot with the dear religious bigots--but if they will\r\nall pull together with us for suffrage we'll continue to bear and\r\nforbear, as we have done for the past forty years.\"\r\n\r\nIn this winter of 1890 many loving letters passed between Miss Anthony\r\nand Rachel Foster Avery, almost too sacred to be quoted, and yet a few\r\nsentences may be used to show the maternal tenderness in the nature of\r\nthe great reformer:\r\n\r\n     Of course I miss you from my side, but do not feel for a moment\r\n     that any doubt of your love and loyalty ever crosses my mind. No,\r\n     my dear, you and all of us must consider only the best interests of\r\n     the loved though not yet seen. Banish anxiety and let the rest of\r\n     us take all the work and care. Be happy in the new life you are\r\n     molding; avoid all but lovely thoughts; let your first and nearest\r\n     and dearest feelings be for the precious little one whose\r\n     temperament and nature you are now stamping. Your every heartbeat,\r\n     not only of love and peace and beauty, but of the reverse as well,\r\n     is making its mark on the unborn.... I feel much better satisfied\r\n     to know Sister Mary is with you for a few days. If her presence is\r\n     comforting, why don't you ask her to stay with you till the wee one\r\n     arrives?\r\n\r\nAnd so the serene and helpful sister Mary remains until a telegram is\r\nsent to the anxious one, by that time in far-off Dakota, announcing the\r\nbirth of a daughter. \"My heart bounded with joy,\" wrote Miss Anthony,\r\n\"to hear the ordeal was passed and the little, sassie Rose Foster Avery\r\nsafely launched upon the big ocean of time.\" And in a little while the\r\nmother replied: \"Darling Aunt Susan, when I lie with baby Rose in my\r\narms, I think so often of what she and I and all women, born and to be\r\nborn, owe to you, and my heart overflows with love and gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] There were also more substantial tokens, an Irish wool shawl from\r\nMrs. Chant; a Webster's Unabridged Dictionary from Mrs. Colby, with the\r\ninscription, \"The words in this volume can not express what women owe\r\nyou;\" a silk dress pattern from brother Daniel R.; a $50 check from\r\nsister Mary; $200 from Sarah Willis of Rochester, and $100 from the\r\nWoman's Political Equality Club of that city; seventy golden dollars\r\nfrom the Toledo Suffrage Club; $50 from Mrs. Arthur A. Mosher of St.\r\nLouis, and enough $5 bills in friendly letters to bring the amount to\r\nover $500. The very next day Miss Anthony gave a part of this to friends\r\nwho were ill or needy, including $50 to Phoebe Couzins.\r\n\r\n[54] Described in detail in Chapter XXXV.\r\n\r\n[55] Miss Anthony wrote in her journal that night: \"Harriot said but a\r\nfew words, yet showed herself worthy her mother and her mother's\r\nlife-long friend and co-worker. It was a proud moment for me.\"\r\n\r\n[56] Among those who contributed largely to this fund were Senator\r\nStanford, $300; Rachel Foster Avery, $300; George C. Lemon, Washington\r\nCity; Hon. Ezra V. Meeker, Puyallup; Rev. Anna H. Shaw; Isabella\r\nHedenberg, Chicago; Alice Stone Blackwell; Emily Howland, Sherwood, N.\r\nY.; O. G. and Alice Peters, Columbus, O.; John L. Whiting, Boston;\r\nSenator R. F. Pettigrew, Sioux Falls; Albert O. Willcox, New York, $100\r\neach; Mary H. Johnson, Louisville, $115, which she earned by knitting\r\nwool shawls and fascinators; May Wright Sewall sent nearly $200,\r\ncollected from Indiana friends; James and Martha Callanan, Des Moines,\r\n$150; Mary Grew, $143 for the Pennsylvania society. Other women sent\r\ntheir jewelry to be sold, and one offered a gift of western land. The\r\nrest of the $5,500 was sent in smaller amounts, and all receipts and\r\nexpenditures were carefully entered on the national treasurer's books\r\nfor 1890. When later some carping individuals complained at so much\r\nmoney passing through Miss Anthony's hands, Mrs. Livermore silenced them\r\nby saying: \"Susan would use every dollar for suffrage if millions were\r\ngiven to her.\"\r\n\r\n[57] Mary Grew wrote her immediately: \"All hail and congratulations! I\r\nread in this morning's paper that you were in the House yesterday; and I\r\nhave no doubt that today you are doing something to promote the passage\r\nof the bill through the Senate.... One object of this letter is to urge\r\nyou to take more care of your health. Emily Howland reports that you are\r\nvery much overworked and exhausted. Pray stop awhile and rest yourself,\r\nfor the sake of the cause as well as for your own and your friends'.\"\r\n\r\n[58] I will authorize you to add my signature to yours in approving any\r\nbills relating to the expenses of the National-American convention just\r\npast. It will save time and trouble. You are on the spot and know all\r\nabout the bills. Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                             LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH DAKOTA CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony left Washington to attend the wedding of her nephew,\r\nWendell Phillips Mosher, and Carolyn Louise Mixer, at Cleveland, O.,\r\nApril 17; stopped in Chicago for a day, and reached Huron, S. Dak.,\r\nApril 23, 1890.[59] During the early winter she had had the most urgent\r\nletters from this State, begging her to hasten her coming, that all\r\ndepended upon her. \"If you will come we will throw off our coats and go\r\nto work,\" wrote the men. \"Woe to the man or woman who is not loyal to\r\nyou! If ever you were needed anywhere, you are needed here now,\" wrote\r\nthe women. When she had been in South Dakota the previous autumn, all\r\nhad united in urging her to take charge of the campaign, and for months\r\nshe had been receiving appeals for help. \"We have not enough money to\r\norganize one county,\" came from a member of the executive committee. In\r\nJanuary, from Alonzo Wardall, vice-president of the State Association,\r\n\"We are very grateful for your earnest efforts in our behalf and trust\r\nyou will be able to spend the coming summer with us.\" His wife, the\r\nsuperintendent of press, wrote in February: \"We shall give you the\r\ncredit, dear Miss Anthony, if we succeed next November.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 5, the president of the association, S. A. Ramsey, said in the\r\ncourse of a long letter: \"I had begun to feel misgivings relative to our\r\nsuccess, because we were so poorly prepared for the great conflict\r\nwhich is pending; but the appointment by the national convention of a\r\nspecial committee to aid us in our work has inspired me with great hope,\r\nespecially as you were placed at the head of that committee.\" Mrs. H. M.\r\nBarker, State organizer, wrote March 10: \"Organizing must have stopped\r\nin the third district, had it not been for the money you sent. It is\r\nutterly impossible for us to pay even $10 a week to organizers. I have\r\nbeen disappointed in my home workers, so many incapacitated for various\r\nreasons. We shall make suffrage a specialty in all our W. C. T. U.\r\ncounty and district conventions.\" And April 11, the State secretary,\r\nRev. M. Barker, supplemented this with: \"It is absolutely impossible to\r\nraise money in the State to pay speakers and furnish literature. This\r\nyou understand. The election must go by default if it is expected.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Washington convention it had been ordered that all contributions\r\nshould be forwarded to the national treasurer and disbursed by order of\r\nthe committee. Notwithstanding this, a large proportion was sent\r\ndirectly to Miss Anthony with the express stipulation that it should be\r\nexpended under her personal supervision. There never was a woman\r\nconnected with the suffrage movement who could collect as much money as\r\nshe; people would give to her who refused all others, with the\r\ninjunction that she should use according to her own judgment. That which\r\nwas sent her for Dakota she turned over at once to the treasurer, Mrs.\r\nSpofford, and paid all the campaign bills by checks.\r\n\r\nThe Dakota people had made the mistake of electing a suffrage board\r\nentirely of men, except the treasurer and State organizer, and, although\r\nthey had not a dollar in their treasury and no prospects, they agreed to\r\npay the secretary $100 a month for his services! When money from all\r\nparts of the country had been sent to the national treasurer, until the\r\nDakota fund reached $5,500, the executive committee of that State\r\nsuddenly discovered that they could manage their own campaign, and made\r\na demand upon the national committee to turn the funds over to them.\r\nMiss Anthony, as chairman, already had sent them $300 for preliminary\r\nwork; had written and telegraphed that the services of Miss Shaw could\r\nbe had for only one month, at that time, and asked if they would arrange\r\nher routes; and had twice written them to send her their \"plan of\r\ncampaign,\" but had received no answer to any of these communications. At\r\nthe last moment she was obliged herself to make out Miss Shaw's route\r\nand send her into the field with practically no advertisement. On March\r\n29 she wrote to the State president:\r\n\r\n     Immediately on the receipt of your answer to my first letter to\r\n     your executive committee, instead of sending you a personal reply I\r\n     wrote again to the entire committee, answering the various points\r\n     presented by you, Mr. and Mrs. Barker and others. This I did to\r\n     save writing the same thing to half a dozen different people, as\r\n     well as to make sure that I should get your official action upon\r\n     what seemed to me most important matters; but to this date I have\r\n     received not only no official answer, but no information which\r\n     shows my letter to have been acted upon. Nor have I heard from any\r\n     member of the committee that you have mapped out any plan of\r\n     campaign, or have accepted and proposed to work on the one which I\r\n     outlined last November at the Aberdeen meeting, and twice over have\r\n     stated in my letters.\r\n\r\n     You, personally, say to me that you must have the national funds\r\n     put into your treasury before you can plan work. Now, my dear sir,\r\n     as a business man you never would give your money to any person or\r\n     committee until they had presented to you a plan for using it which\r\n     met your approval. Then I have had no indication of any intention\r\n     on the part of your executive committee or State organizer to hold\r\n     any series of suffrage meetings or conventions. The only ones\r\n     written of are W. C. T. U. county and district conventions.\r\n     California's suffrage lecturer, I am informed, is to be introduced\r\n     to the State at the First District W. C. T. U. Convention.\r\n\r\n     Now, I want to say to you individually, and to the executive\r\n     committee generally, that the National-American South Dakota\r\n     committee will pay the money entrusted to them only to _suffrage_\r\n     lecturers and _suffrage_ conventions. We shall not pay it to any\r\n     individual or association for any other purpose, or in any other\r\n     name, than suffrage for women, pure and simple. We talked this over\r\n     fully in your executive committee meeting at Aberdeen last fall,\r\n     and all agreed that, while the temperance societies worked for\r\n     suffrage in their way, the suffrage campaign should be carried\r\n     forward on the basis of the one principle. Our national money will\r\n     not go to aid Prohibition leagues, Grand Army encampments, Woman's\r\n     Relief Corps, W. C. T. U. societies or any others, though all, we\r\n     hope, will declare and work for the suffrage amendment. We can not\r\n     ally ourselves with the Prohibition or Anti-Prohibition party--the\r\n     Democrats or the Republicans. Each may do splendid work for\r\n     suffrage within its own organization, and we shall rejoice in all\r\n     that do so; but the South Dakota and the National-American\r\n     Associations must stand on their own ground.\r\n\r\n     Co-operation is what our committee desire, and we stand ready to\r\n     aid in holding three series of county conventions with three sets\r\n     of speakers, at least one of each set a national speaker, beginning\r\n     on May 1 and continuing until the school election, June 24. I am\r\n     feeling sadly disappointed that every voting precinct of every\r\n     county has not been visited, and will not have been by the 1st of\r\n     May, as was agreed upon at Aberdeen. Still, I want to begin now and\r\n     henceforth push the work; but the entire fund would not pay every\r\n     single man and woman in the State who helps, hence every one who\r\n     can must work without cost either to the State or national\r\n     committee.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of April Miss Anthony wrote to the State secretary:\r\n\r\n     Yours mailed April 3 is received. The National-American committee\r\n     have only about $1,300 yet in hand, and we have arranged a trip\r\n     through your State for Rev. Anna Shaw. When your committee did not\r\n     answer my telegram, I could not wait longer for fear of losing Miss\r\n     Shaw's good work before the students of your various educational\r\n     institutions, and having had urgent importunities from Mrs. D. W.\r\n     Mayer to send some of our very best speakers to Vermillion so that\r\n     the 600 students there might be roused to thought before separating\r\n     for the summer, I felt the cause could not afford to lose Miss\r\n     Shaw's effective services and so mapped out her route, and\r\n     telegraphed and wrote asking that she be advertised.\r\n\r\n     Now, my dear friends, once for all, I want to say on behalf of our\r\n     South Dakota committee, the National-American Association, and the\r\n     friends who have placed money in our hands--that we shall no more\r\n     turn it over to you to appropriate as your executive committee\r\n     please, without our voice or vote, than you would turn over the\r\n     money entrusted to your care to our committee to spend as we\r\n     choose, without your voice or vote. But while we shall retain our\r\n     right to expend the national fund in accordance with our best\r\n     judgment, we shall in future, as I have several times written your\r\n     committee, hold ourselves ready to help defray the cost of whatever\r\n     work you present to us. I have once verbally, and twice or oftener\r\n     by letter, presented a plan of campaign asking your adoption of it,\r\n     or of one which suited you better, telling you that we would\r\n     co-operate with you in executing the plan and paying therefor; and\r\n     to all of my propositions to help, the one reply has been: \"The\r\n     wheels are blocked until you turn the money over to us. You in\r\n     Washington can not run the South Dakota campaign.\" Now nearly five\r\n     months have elapsed, and, so far as reported, the resident\r\n     committee have adopted no plan and had no organizers at work in the\r\n     different counties.\r\n\r\nRev. Anna Shaw made her lecture tour throughout the State, and wrote\r\nMiss Anthony that the people everywhere were most anxious for her to\r\ncome and there was not the slightest disaffection except on the part of\r\ntwo or three persons who wished to handle the funds. To these Miss Shaw\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     What our committee object to, and what they have no right to do by\r\n     the vote of our convention, is to put a dollar of our money into\r\n     your treasury to be spent without our consent or for any purpose of\r\n     which we do not approve. For example, not one of us, myself least\r\n     of all, will consent to take out of the contributions from friends\r\n     of suffrage one dollar to pay towards a salary of $100 a month to\r\n     any man as secretary. We do not pay our national secretary a cent,\r\n     and we have no doubt there are plenty of women in the State of\r\n     Dakota who would be glad to do the secretary's work for love of the\r\n     cause. I understand it has been planned, and the statement has gone\r\n     out, that your committee propose to cut loose from Miss Anthony.\r\n     Now if you do, you cut loose from the goose that lays the golden\r\n     egg for the South Dakota work; you cut loose from all the national\r\n     speakers and workers and all the money given.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony wrote Alice Stone Blackwell:\r\n\r\n     I fully agree with you and dear Mrs. Wallace about not antagonizing\r\n     the prohibition and W. C. T. U. people who made the 6,000 majority\r\n     last fall in South Dakota; but I also feel that we must not\r\n     antagonize the license people, for they are one-half of the voters,\r\n     lacking only 6,000, and fully 6,000 of the Prohibition men are\r\n     anti-suffragists and can not be converted. Hence it is also vastly\r\n     important that the license men shall not have just cause to feel\r\n     that our national suffrage lecturers are W. C. T. U. agents. That\r\n     is my one point--that we shall not at the outset repel every man\r\n     who is not a Prohibitionist.\r\n\r\n     But we shall see. I surely am as earnest a prohibitionist and total\r\n     abstainer as any woman or man in South Dakota or anywhere else. But\r\n     they have prohibition, and now are after suffrage; therefore it\r\n     should not be the old prohibition and W. C. T. U. yardstick in this\r\n     campaign, but instead it must be the woman suffrage yardstick alone\r\n     by which every man and every woman shall be measured. Best assured\r\n     I shall try not to offend a single voter, of whatever persuasion,\r\n     for it is votes we are after now. I hope to make such a good\r\n     showing of work done in this spring campaign, that our friends will\r\n     feel like giving another and larger contribution to help on the\r\n     fall canvass.\r\n\r\nThe editors of the two suffrage papers, the officers of the\r\nNational-American Association, the largest contributors to the fund and\r\nthe other members of the committee, all sustained Miss Anthony in her\r\nposition. Zerelda G. Wallace published the following notice: \"Having\r\npledged to the committee on work in South Dakota one month's services in\r\nthe projected suffrage campaign in that State, I wish to announce\r\npublicly that all I do there will be done under the direction of the\r\nSouth Dakota committee of which Susan B. Anthony is chairman.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, on April 15, the executive committee of South Dakota forwarded\r\ntheir plan, which included a provision that \"every dollar expended\r\nshould pass through the State treasury, and that the State executive\r\ncommittee should have control of all plans of work and decide what\r\nlecturers should be engaged;\" but by the time it reached Washington Miss\r\nAnthony was well on her way to South Dakota. When she arrived she found\r\nthat it was just as she had been informed, the disaffection was confined\r\nto a few persons, but the body of workers made her welcome and she was\r\ncordially received throughout the State. Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe, State\r\nlecturer and one of the ablest women, at once placed her services at\r\nMiss Anthony's disposal, and in a short time nearly all were working in\r\nharmony with the national plan.\r\n\r\nThe autumn previous, when Miss Anthony was attending a convention in\r\nMinneapolis, H. L. Loucks and Alonzo Wardall, president and secretary of\r\nthe South Dakota Farmers' Alliance, had made a journey expressly to ask\r\nher to come into the State to conduct this canvass. She had replied that\r\nshe never again would go into an amendment campaign unless it was\r\nendorsed and advocated by at least one of the two great political\r\nparties. They assured her that the Farmers' Alliance dominated politics\r\nin South Dakota, that it held the balance of power, and the year\r\nprevious had compelled the Republicans to put a prohibition plank in\r\ntheir platform and, through the influence of the Alliance, that\r\namendment had been carried by 6,000 majority. They were ready now to do\r\nthe same for woman suffrage. It was wholly because of the assurance of\r\nthis support that Miss Anthony took the responsibility of raising the\r\nfunds and conducting the campaign in South Dakota.\r\n\r\nWhen she arrived in the State, April 23, none of the political\r\nconventions had been held. In co-operation with the State executive\r\nboard, she at once planned the suffrage mass meetings, arranged work for\r\nthe corps of speakers, pushed the district organization and made\r\nspeeches herself almost every night. The National-American Association\r\nsent into the State and paid the expenses of Rev. Anna Shaw, Rev.\r\nOlympia Brown, Laura M. Johns, Mary Seymour Howell, Carrie Chapman\r\nCatt, Julia B. Nelson and Clara B. Colby.[60] It also contributed over\r\n$1,000 to the office expenses of the State committee, paid $400 to the\r\nWoman's Journal and Woman's Tribune for thousands of copies to be sent\r\nto residents of South Dakota during the campaign, and flooded the State\r\nwith suffrage literature. The speakers collected altogether $1,400 in\r\nSouth Dakota, which went toward their expenses. California, as her\r\ncontribution to the national fund, raised $1,000 through a committee\r\nconsisting of Hon. George C. Perkins, Mrs. Ellen Clark Sargent, Mrs.\r\nKnox Goodrich, Hon. W. H. Mills, Miss Sarah C. Severance and Dr. Alida\r\nC. Avery. This was used to pay the expenses of Matilda Hindman for eight\r\nmonths, as one of the campaign organizers and speakers.\r\n\r\nAs Miss Anthony was on her way to a meeting June 3, she received a\r\ntelegram which sent her at once to Huron, where the annual convention of\r\nthe Farmers' Alliance was in session. Upon arriving she found her\r\ninformation had been correct, that the Alliance and the Knights of Labor\r\nhad combined forces and were about to form an independent party. She was\r\npermitted to address the convention and in the most impassioned language\r\nshe begged them not to take this step, as it would be death to the woman\r\nsuffrage amendment. She appealed to them in the name of their wives and\r\ndaughters at home, doing double duty in order that the men might attend\r\nthis convention; she reminded them of their pledges to herself and the\r\nother women to stand by the amendment, and showed them that, of\r\nthemselves, they would not be strong enough to carry it, and that the\r\nRepublican party, unless sustained by the Alliance, would not and could\r\nnot support it. Her appeals fell upon deaf ears, and the old story was\r\nrepeated--the women sacrificed to party expediency.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance of 478 delegates, at its State convention the previous\r\nyear, November, 1889, after Miss Anthony's speech and after she had met\r\nwith its business committee, had passed this resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we will do all in our power to aid in woman's\r\n     enfranchisement in South Dakota at the next general election, by\r\n     bringing it before the local Alliances for agitation and\r\n     discussion, thereby educating the masses upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Knights of Labor, at their annual convention in Aberdeen, January,\r\n1890, had adopted the following:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Knights of Labor, in assembly convened, do\r\n     hereby declare that we will support with all our strength the\r\n     amendment to the State Constitution of South Dakota, to be voted on\r\n     at the next general election, giving to our wives, mothers and\r\n     sisters the ballot.... We believe that giving to the women of our\r\n     country the ballot is the first step towards securing those reforms\r\n     for which all true Knights of Labor are striving.\r\n\r\nThis action was taken by both conventions after the amendment had been\r\nsubmitted, and it was intended as a pledge of support. And yet the\r\nfollowing June these two bodies formed a new political party and refused\r\nto put a woman suffrage plank in their platform! H. L. Loucks was\r\nhimself a candidate for governor on this Independent ticket, and in his\r\nannual address at this time never mentioned woman suffrage. Before\r\nadjourning, the convention passed a long resolution making seven or\r\neight declarations, among them one that \"no citizen should be\r\ndisfranchised on account of sex,\" but, during the entire campaign, as\r\nfar as their party advocacy was concerned, this question was a dead\r\nissue.[61]\r\n\r\nThe State Democratic Convention met at Aberdeen the following week, and\r\na committee of representative Dakota women was sent to present the\r\nclaims of the amendment. They were invited to seats on the platform and\r\nthere listened to an address by Hon. E. W. Miller, of Parker county,\r\nland receiver of the Huron district, in which, according to the press\r\nreports, \"he declared that no decent, respectable woman asked for the\r\nballot; that the women who did so were a disgrace to their homes; that\r\nwhen women voted men would have to suckle the babies,\" and used other\r\nexpressions of an indecent nature, \"which were received with prolonged\r\nand vigorous cheers.\" (Argus-Leader, June 16, 1890.)[62] Judge Bangs, of\r\nRapid City, who had brought in a minority report in favor of a suffrage\r\nplank, supported it in an able and dignified speech, but it was\r\noverwhelmingly voted down amidst great disorder. A large delegation of\r\nRussians came to this convention wearing great yellow badges (the\r\nbrewers' color in South Dakota) lettered \"Against woman suffrage and\r\nSusan B. Anthony.\"\r\n\r\nThe Republican State Convention met in Mitchell, August 27. A suffrage\r\nmass meeting was held the two days preceding, and every possible effort\r\nmade to secure a plank in the platform. Most of the national speakers\r\nand a large body of earnest and influential South Dakota men and women\r\nwere present. Rev. Anna Shaw graphically relates an incident which\r\ndeserves a place in history:\r\n\r\n     When the Republicans had their State convention some of the leading\r\n     men promised that we should have a plank in the platform, so we\r\n     went down to see it through. We requested seats in the body of the\r\n     house for our delegation, which was composed of most of the\r\n     national speakers and the brainiest women in South Dakota, but we\r\n     were informed there was absolutely no room for us. Finally a friend\r\n     secured admission for ten on the very back of the platform, where\r\n     we could neither see nor hear unless we stood on our chairs. We\r\n     begged a good seat for Miss Anthony but no place could be made for\r\n     her. Soon after the convention opened, an announcement was made\r\n     that a delegation was waiting outside and that back of this\r\n     delegation would probably be 5,000 votes. It was at once moved and\r\n     seconded that they be invited in, and a committee was sent to\r\n     escort them to seats on the floor of the house. In a moment it\r\n     returned, followed by three big, dirty Indians in blankets and\r\n     moccasins. Plenty of room for Indian men, but not a seat for\r\n     American women!\r\n\r\n     We asked for a chance to address the delegates, but the chairman\r\n     adjourned the convention, and then announced that we might speak\r\n     during the recess. That night we went back again to the hall, and\r\n     the resolution committee not being ready to report, the audience\r\n     called for leading speakers, but none of them dared say a word\r\n     because they did not yet know what would be in the platform.\r\n     Finally when no man would respond they called for me, and I went\r\n     forward and said: \"Gentlemen, I am not afraid to speak, for I know\r\n     what is in _our_ platform and I know also what I want you to\r\n     introduce into yours.\"\r\n\r\nShe then made her plea. It was cordially received, but the platform\r\nentirely ignored the question of woman suffrage. This was true also of\r\nthe press and party speakers during the campaign, with one exception.\r\nHon. J. A. Pickler was renominated for Congress, and in his speech of\r\nacceptance declared his belief in woman suffrage and his regret that the\r\nRepublicans did not adopt it in their platform. He was warned by the\r\nparty leaders, but replied that he would advocate it even if he\r\nimperilled his chances for election. He spoke in favor of the amendment\r\nthroughout his campaign and was elected without difficulty. His wife,\r\nAlice M. Pickler, was one of the most effective speakers and workers\r\namong the Dakota women and, although Mr. Pickler was a candidate, she\r\ndid not once speak upon Republican issues but confined herself wholly to\r\nthe question of woman suffrage. She was as true and courageous as her\r\nhusband. Although fair reports of the suffrage meetings were published,\r\nscarcely a newspaper in the State gave editorial endorsement to the\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nThe adverse action of the party conventions virtually destroyed all\r\nchance for success, but the suffrage speakers usually found enthusiastic\r\naudiences, and the friends still hoped against hope that they might\r\nsecure a popular vote. Miss Anthony never lost courage, and her letters\r\nwere full of good cheer. \"Tell everybody,\" she wrote, \"that I am\r\nperfectly well in body and mind, never better, and never doing more\r\nwork.... Anna Shaw and I are on our way to the Black Hills, and shall\r\nrush into Sioux City for a pay lecture and turn the proceeds over to the\r\nDakota fund.... O, the lack of the modern comforts and conveniences! But\r\nI can put up with it better than any of the young folks.... All of us\r\nmust strain every nerve to move the hearts of men as they never before\r\nwere moved. I shall push ahead and do my level best to carry this State,\r\ncome weal or woe to me personally.... I never felt so buoyed up with the\r\nlove and sympathy and confidence of the good people everywhere....\r\nThe friends here are very sanguine and if I had not had my hopes dashed\r\nto the earth in seven State campaigns before this, I, too, would dare\r\nbelieve. But I shall not be cast down, even if voted down.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anna Howard Shaw (Signed: \"With affectionate severence\r\nfor women's truest friend, Anna Howard Shaw.\")]\r\n\r\nThe eastern friends sent appreciative letters. \"The thought of you and\r\nyour fellow-workers in South Dakota in this hot weather and with\r\ninsufficient funds, has lain like lead upon my heart,\" wrote John\r\nHooker. \"How I wish I could accept your invitation to come to you and\r\ntalk to the old soldiers,\" said Clara Barton; \"but alas, I have not the\r\nstrength. My heart, my hopes, are with you and if there is a spoke I can\r\nget hold of, I will help turn that wheel before the campaign is over. My\r\nlove is always with you and your glorious cause, my dear, dear Susan\r\nAnthony.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Hoping once more to see you I am my dear\r\nfriend, Yours faithfully, Clara Barton\"]\r\n\r\nAnna Shaw wrote from Ohio in August: \"I am trying to follow your\r\nmagnificent example, in quietly passing over every personal matter for\r\nthe sake of the greatest good for the work. Whenever I find myself\r\ngiving way, I think of you and all you have borne and get fresh courage\r\nto try once more. Dear Aunt Susan, my heart is reaching out with such a\r\ngreat longing for my mother, now eighty years old, that I must go to her\r\nfor a few days before I enter upon that long canvass, but I will come to\r\nyou soon.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a hard campaign, the summer the hottest ever known, the distances\r\nlong, the entertainment the best which could be offered, good in the\r\ntowns but in the rural districts sometimes very poor, and the speakers\r\nslept more than once in sod houses where the only fuel for preparing the\r\nmeals consisted of \"buffalo chips.\" The people were in severe financial\r\nstraits. A two years' drouth had destroyed the crops, and prairie fires\r\nhad swept away the little which was left. \"Starvation stares them in the\r\nface,\" Miss Anthony wrote. \"Why could not Congress have appropriated the\r\nmoney for artesian wells and helped these earnest, honest people,\r\ninstead of voting $40,000 for a commission to come out here and\r\ninvestigate?\"\r\n\r\nFrequently the speakers had to drive twenty miles between the afternoon\r\nand evening meetings, in the heat of summer and the chill of late\r\nautumn; at one time forty miles on a wagon seat without a back. On the\r\nFourth of July, a roasting day, Miss Anthony spoke in the morning, drove\r\nfifteen miles to speak again in the afternoon, and then left at night in\r\na pouring rain for a long ride in a freight-car. At one town the school\r\nhouse was the only place for speaking purposes, but the Russian trustees\r\nannounced that \"they did not want to hear any women preach,\" so after\r\nthe long trip, the meeting had to be given up. Several times in the\r\nmidst of their speeches, the audience was stampeded by cyclones, not a\r\nsoul left in the house.[63] The people came twenty and thirty miles to\r\nthese meetings, bringing their dinners. Miss Anthony speaks always in\r\nthe highest terms of the fine character of the Dakota men and women, and\r\nof their large families of bright, healthy children.\r\n\r\nThe speakers never tire of telling their experiences during that\r\ncampaign. Mary Seymour Howell relates in her own interesting way that\r\nonce she and Miss Anthony had been riding for hours in a stage which\r\ncreaked and groaned at every turn of the wheels, the poor, dilapidated\r\nhorses not able to travel out of a walk, the driver a prematurely-old\r\nlittle boy whose feet did not touch the floor, and a cold Dakota wind\r\nblowing straight into their faces. After an unbroken, homesick silence\r\nof an hour, Miss Anthony said in a subdued and solemn voice, \"Mrs.\r\nHowell, humanity is at a very low ebb!\" The tone, the look, the words,\r\nso in harmony with the surroundings, produced a reaction which sent her\r\noff into a fit of laughter, in which Miss Anthony soon joined.\r\n\r\nThey had been warned to keep away from a certain hotel, at one place, as\r\nit was the very worst in the whole State. At the close of the afternoon\r\nmeeting there, a man came up and said he would be pleased to entertain\r\nthe speakers and could make them very comfortable. This seemed to be a\r\nsure escape, so they thankfully accepted his invitation, but when they\r\nreached his home, they discovered that he was the landlord of the poor\r\nhotel! Miss Anthony charged Mrs. Howell to make the best of it without a\r\nword of complaint. They went to supper, amidst heat and flies, and found\r\nsour bread, muddy coffee and stewed green grapes. Miss Anthony ate and\r\ndrank and talked and smiled, and every little while touched Mrs.\r\nHowell's foot with her own in a reassuring manner. After supper Mrs.\r\nHowell went to her little, bare room, which she soon learned by the\r\nclatter of the dishes was next to the kitchen, and through the thin\r\npartition she heard the landlady say: \"Well, I never supposed I could\r\nentertain big-bugs, and I thought I couldn't live through having Susan\r\nB. Anthony here, but I'm getting along all right. You ought to hear her\r\nlaugh; why, she laughs just like other people!\" Mrs. Howell gives this\r\ngraphic description of the meetings at Madison, July 10:\r\n\r\n     In the afternoon we drove some distance to a beautiful lake where\r\n     Miss Anthony spoke to 1,000 men, a Farmers' Alliance picnic. When\r\n     she asked how many would vote for the suffrage amendment, all was\r\n     one mighty \"aye,\" like the deep voice of the sea. That evening we\r\n     spoke in the opera house in the city. While Miss Anthony was\r\n     speaking a telegram for her was handed to me, and as I arose to\r\n     make the closing address I gave it to her. I had just begun when\r\n     she came quickly forward, put her hand on my arm and said, \"Stop a\r\n     moment, I want to read this telegram.\" It was from Washington,\r\n     saying that President Harrison had signed the bill admitting\r\n     Wyoming into the Union with woman suffrage in its constitution.\r\n     Before she could finish reading the great audience was on its feet,\r\n     cheering and waving handkerchiefs and fans. After the enthusiasm\r\n     had subsided Miss Anthony made a short but wonderful speech. The\r\n     very tones of her voice changed; there were ringing notes of\r\n     gladness and tender ones of thankfulness. It was the first great\r\n     victory of her forty years of work. She spoke as one inspired,\r\n     while the audience listened for every word, some cheering, others\r\n     weeping.\r\n\r\n     When Miss Anthony was starting for South Dakota she was urged not\r\n     to go, through fear of the effect of such a campaign on her health.\r\n     Her reply was, \"Better lose me than lose a State.\" A grand answer\r\n     from a grander woman. And this night in South Dakota we had won a\r\n     State and still had Miss Anthony with us, the central figure of the\r\n     suffrage movement as she was the central figure in that\r\n     never-to-be-forgotten night of great rejoicing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Ever affectionately and faithfully yours,\r\nMary Seymour Howell.\"]\r\n\r\nAs very few women were able to hire help, many were obliged to bring\r\ntheir babies to the meetings and, before the speaking was over, the heat\r\nand confusion generally set them all to crying. Miss Anthony was very\r\npatient and always expressed much sympathy for the overworked and tired\r\nmothers. One occasion, however, was too much for her, and Anna Shaw thus\r\ndescribes it:\r\n\r\n     One intensely hot Sunday afternoon, a meeting was held by the side\r\n     of a sod church, which had been extended by canvas coverings from\r\n     the wagons. The audience crowded up as close as they could be\r\n     packed to where Miss Anthony stood on a barn door laid across some\r\n     boxes. A woman with a baby sat very near the edge of this\r\n     improvised platform. The child grew tired and uneasy and finally\r\n     began to pinch Miss Anthony's ankles. She stepped back and he\r\n     immediately commenced to scream, so she stepped forward again and\r\n     he resumed his pinching. She endured it as long as she could, but\r\n     at last stooped down and whispered to the mother, \"I think your\r\n     baby is too warm in here; take him out and give him a drink and he\r\n     will feel better.\" The woman jerked it up and started out,\r\n     exclaiming, \"Well, this is the first time I have ever been insulted\r\n     on account of my motherhood!\" A number of men gathered around her,\r\n     saying, \"That is just what to expect from these old maid\r\n     suffragists.\" Some one told Miss Anthony she had lost twenty votes\r\n     by this. \"Well,\" she replied, \"if they could see the welts on my\r\n     ankles where they were pinched to keep that child still, they would\r\n     bring their twenty votes back.\"\r\n\r\n     She said to me the next day: \"Now, Anna, no matter how many babies\r\n     cry you must not say one word or it will be taken as an insult to\r\n     motherhood.\" That afternoon I gave a little talk. The church was\r\n     crowded and there were so many children it seemed as if every\r\n     family had twins. There were at least six of them crying at the top\r\n     of their lungs. The louder they cried, the louder I yelled; and the\r\n     louder I yelled, the louder they cried, for they were scared.\r\n     Finally a gentleman asked, \"Don't you want those children taken\r\n     out?\" \"O, no,\" said I, \"there is nothing that inspires me so much\r\n     as the music of children's voices,\" and although a number of men\r\n     protested, I would not allow one of them taken from the room. I was\r\n     bound I wouldn't lose any votes.\r\n\r\nAmong the racy anecdotes which Miss Shaw relates of that memorable\r\ncampaign, is one which shows Miss Anthony's ready retort:\r\n\r\n     Many of the halls were merely rough boards and most of them had no\r\n     seats. I never saw so many intemperate men as at ----, in front of\r\n     the stores, on the street corners, and in the saloons, and yet they\r\n     had a prohibition law! We could not get any hall to speak in--they\r\n     were all in use for variety shows--and there was no church\r\n     finished, but the Presbyterian was the furthest along and they let\r\n     us have that, putting boards across nail kegs for seats. It was\r\n     filled to overflowing and people crowded up close to the platform.\r\n     One man came in so drunk he could not stand, so he sat down on the\r\n     edge and leaned against the table. Miss Anthony gave her argument\r\n     to prove what the ballot had done for laboring men in England and\r\n     was working up to show what it would do for women in the United\r\n     States, when suddenly the man roused and said: \"Now look 'ere, old\r\n     gal, we've heard 'nuf about Victoria; can't you tell's somethin'\r\n     'bout George Washington?\" The people tried to hush him, but soon he\r\n     broke out again with, \"We've had 'nuf of England; can't you tell's\r\n     somethin' 'bout our grand republic?\" The men cried, \"Put him out,\r\n     put him out!\" but Miss Anthony said: \"No, gentlemen, he is a\r\n     product of man's government, and I want you to see what sort you\r\n     make.\"\r\n\r\nIn September Carrie Chapman Catt, one of the coolest, most logical and\r\nlevel-headed women who ever went into a campaign, at the request of the\r\nState executive committee gave her opinion of the situation as follows:\r\n\r\n     We have not a ghost of a show for success. Our cause can be\r\n     compared with the work of prohibition, always remembering ours is\r\n     the more unpopular. Last year the Methodist church led off in State\r\n     conference and declared for prohibition. It was followed by every\r\n     other church, except the German Lutheran and Catholic, even the\r\n     Scandinavian Lutherans voting largely for it. Next the Republican,\r\n     the strongest party, stood for it, because if they did not it meant\r\n     a party break. The Farmers' Alliance were solid for it. The\r\n     leaders were put to work, a large amount of money was collected and\r\n     representative men went out in local campaigns. It was debated on\r\n     the street, and men of influence converted those of weaker minds.\r\n\r\n     Now what have we? 1st.--The Lutherans, both German and\r\n     Scandinavian, and the Catholics are bitterly opposed. The\r\n     Methodists, our strongest friends everywhere else, are not so here.\r\n     2d.--We have one party openly and two others secretly against us.\r\n     3d.--While this county, for instance, gave $700 to prohibition, it\r\n     gives $2.50 to suffrage and claims that for hall rent, the amount\r\n     then not being sufficient. 4th.--When I suggested to the committee\r\n     to start a vigorous county campaign and get men of influence to go\r\n     out and speak, they did not know of one man willing to face the\r\n     political animosities it would engender.\r\n\r\n     With the exception of the work of a few women, nothing is being\r\n     done. We have opposed to us the most powerful elements in the\r\n     politics of the State. Continuing as we are, we can't poll 20,000\r\n     votes. We are converting women to \"want to vote\" by the hundreds,\r\n     but we are not having any appreciable effect upon the men. This is\r\n     because men have been accustomed to take new ideas only when\r\n     accompanied by party leadership with brass bands and huzzahs. We\r\n     have a total lack of all. Ours is a cold, lonesome little movement,\r\n     which will make our hearts ache about November 5. We must get\r\n     Dakota _men_ in the work. They are not talking woman suffrage on\r\n     the street. There is an absolute indifference concerning it. We\r\n     need some kind of a political mustard plaster to make things\r\n     lively. We are appealing to justice for success, when it is\r\n     selfishness that governs mankind....\r\n\r\nThe campaign was continued, however, with all the zeal and ability which\r\nboth State and national workers could command. There were between\r\nfifteen and twenty thousand Scandinavians in the State and a woman was\r\nsent to address them in their own language--one woman! A German woman\r\nwas sent among the men of that nationality. The last night before\r\nelection, mass meetings were held in all the large towns, Miss Anthony\r\nand Miss Shaw being at Deadwood. In her excellent summing-up of the\r\ncampaign, Elizabeth M. Wardall, State superintendent of press, gives:\r\n\"Number of addresses by the national speakers, 789; by the State\r\nspeakers, 707; under the auspices of the W. C. T. U., 104; total, 1,600;\r\nlocal and county clubs of women organized, 400. Literature sent to every\r\nvoter in the State.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was the result of all this expenditure of time, labor and money?\r\nThere were 68,604 ballots cast; 22,972 for woman suffrage; 45,632\r\nopposed; majority against, 22,660. Eight months of hard work by a large\r\ncorps of the ablest women in the United States, 1,600 speeches, $8,000\r\nin money, for less than 23,000 votes! There were 30,000 foreigners in\r\nSouth Dakota, Russians, Scandinavians, Poles and other nationalities. It\r\nis claimed they voted almost solidly against woman suffrage, but even if\r\nthis were true they must have had the assistance of 15,000 American men.\r\nIf only those men who believed in prohibition had voted for woman\r\nsuffrage it would have carried, as had that measure, by 6,000 majority.\r\nThe opponents of prohibition, of course, massed themselves against\r\nputting the ballot in the hands of women.\r\n\r\nThe main interest of this election was centered in the fight between\r\nHuron and Pierre for the location of the capital. There never in any\r\nState was a more shameless and corrupt buying and selling of votes, and\r\nthe woman suffrage amendment was one of the chief articles of barter.\r\nThe bribers, the liquor dealers and gamblers, were reinforced here, as\r\nhad been the case in other State campaigns, by their faithful allies,\r\n\"the Remonstrants of Boston,\" who circulated their anonymous sheet\r\nthrough every nook and corner of the State.\r\n\r\nAll of the speakers who took any prominent part in the campaign were\r\npaid except Miss Anthony.[64] She contributed her services for over six\r\nmonths and refused during that time an offer of $500 from the State of\r\nWashington for ten lectures and a contract from one of the largest\r\nlecture bureaus in the country at $60 per night.[65] At the close of the\r\ncanvass she gave from the national fund $100 each to Mrs. Wardall and\r\nPhilena E. Johnson, who had worked so faithfully without pay. Then,\r\nlacking $300 of enough to settle all the bills, she drew that amount\r\nfrom her own small bank account and put it in as a contribution to the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the State W. C. T. U., September 26, a strong\r\nresolution was adopted endorsing Miss Anthony's work in South Dakota\r\nand she was made an honorary member. After the election the State\r\nsuffrage committee unanimously passed the following resolution: \"The\r\nearnest and heartfelt gratitude of all the suffragists of South Dakota\r\nis hereby extended to Susan B. Anthony, who has devoted her entire time,\r\nenergy and experience for six months to the cause of liberty and\r\njustice.\"\r\n\r\nAnna Shaw said that in all her years of preaching and lecturing she had\r\nnever been so exhausted as at the close of that canvass. Mrs. Catt was\r\nprostrated with typhoid fever immediately upon reaching home, and\r\nhovered between life and death for many months, in her delirium\r\nconstantly making speeches and talking of the campaign. Mary Anthony\r\nsaid, \"When my sister returned from South Dakota I realized for the\r\nfirst time that she was indeed threescore and ten.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[59] \"I am homesick already,\" she wrote Mrs. Spofford, \"and have been\r\nevery minute since I left Washington. My choice would be to live there\r\nmost of the year, but no! Duty first, ease and comfort afterwards, even\r\nif they never come.\"\r\n\r\n[60] Mrs. Wallace was kept at home by serious illness in her family. In\r\na letter to Miss Anthony, August 18, expressing her deep regret, she\r\nsaid: \"Money would be no object with me if I could overcome the other\r\ndifficulties in the way, but as I can not, I fear I shall have to let\r\nyou think I am unreliable. I regret this, as there is no woman (except\r\nMiss Willard) whose good opinion I value so highly as yours.\"\r\n\r\n[61] In order to keep her next engagement, Miss Anthony was obliged to\r\nleave Huron at 7:30 A. M., drive sixteen miles in the face of a heavy\r\nnorthwest wind and rain, travel all day and speak that evening. \"I did\r\nthe best I could,\" she wrote in her journal.\r\n\r\n[62] Then E. W. Miller took the floor, and in a disgusting manner and\r\nvile language berated the women present and all woman suffragists....\r\nMiller disgraced the name of Democracy, disgraced his constituents,\r\ndisgraced South Dakota, disgraced the name of man by his brutal and low\r\nremarks in the presence of ladies and gentlemen.--Aberdeen Pioneer.\r\n\r\n[63] At one place where this happened, the Russian sheriff had locked\r\nthe court house doors, but the women compelled him to open them. He was\r\nentirely converted by the addresses of the afternoon, and in the evening\r\nwhen the storm was approaching, he rushed to Miss Anthony and exclaimed,\r\n\"Come, quick, and let me take you to the cellar, where you will be\r\nperfectly safe.\" \"O, no, thank you,\" she replied, \"a little thing like a\r\ncyclone does not frighten me.\"\r\n\r\n[64] Henry B. Blackwell made a speaking tour of six weeks through the\r\nState at his own expense.\r\n\r\n[65] A letter from Mrs. Catt said: \"I think you are the most unselfish\r\nwoman in all the world. You are determined to see that all the rest of\r\nus are paid and comfortable, but think it entirely proper to work\r\nyourself for nothing. If some of your self-sacrificing spirit could be\r\ninjected into the great body of suffragists, we would win a hundred\r\nyears sooner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nWYOMING--MISS ANTHONY GOES TO HOUSEKEEPING.\r\n\r\n1890-1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony accepted the defeat in South Dakota as philosophically as\r\nshe had those of the past forty years, bidding the women of the State be\r\nof good cheer and continue the work of education until at last the men\r\nshould be ready to grant them freedom. With Mrs. Colby and Mrs. Julia B.\r\nNelson she went directly to the Nebraska convention at Fremont, November\r\n12.[66] The 18th found her in Atchison with Mrs. Catt and Mrs. Colby, at\r\nthe Kansas convention, \"where,\" the Tribune says, \"she took part in all\r\nthe deliberations and methods of work as critically and earnestly as if\r\nshe herself would have to carry them out.\"\r\n\r\nTwo weeks were pleasantly spent visiting at Leavenworth and Fort Scott.\r\nThanksgiving was passed at the latter place and the next day the\r\nsuffrage friends, under the leadership of Dr. Sarah C. Hall, whom Miss\r\nAnthony called \"the backbone of Bourbon county,\" gave her a very pretty\r\nreception at the home of Mrs. H. B. Brown. Saturday she spoke, morning,\r\nafternoon and evening, at the county suffrage convention. Her time for\r\nrest and recreation was very brief, and by December 4 she and Mrs. Catt\r\nwere in the midst of the Iowa convention at Des Moines. As usual when\r\nflying from one side of the continent to the other, she stopped at\r\nIndianapolis for a few days' work with Mrs. Sewall, and they sat up into\r\nthe wee, sma' hours, planning and arranging for the Washington\r\nconvention, the National Council and the World's Fair Congress of Women.\r\n\r\nShe arrived in Rochester Saturday morning; that evening Anna Shaw came\r\nin from her tour of lectures all along the way from South Dakota, and it\r\nwould not be surprising to know that a business meeting of two was held\r\nthe next day after church services. Monday evening the Political\r\nEquality Club tendered them a reception at the Chamber of Commerce,\r\nwhich was largely attended. On December 16 and 17 they addressed the\r\nState Suffrage Convention in this city, and soon afterwards Miss Anthony\r\nstarted for Washington by way of New York and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe year 1890 had been eventful for the cause of woman suffrage, in\r\nspite of the defeat in Dakota. The bill for the admission of Wyoming as\r\na State had been presented in the House of Representatives December 18,\r\n1889. Its constitution, which had been adopted by more than a two-thirds\r\nvote of the people, provided that \"the right of its citizens to vote and\r\nhold office should not be denied or abridged on account of sex.\" The\r\nHouse Committee on Territories, through Charles S. Baker, of Rochester,\r\nreported in favor of admission. The minority report presented by William\r\nM. Springer, of Illinois, covered twenty-three pages; two devoted to\r\nvarious other reasons for non-admission and twenty-one to objections\r\nbecause of the woman suffrage clause, \"which provides that not only\r\nmales may vote but their wives also.\" Incorporated in this report were\r\nthe overworked articles of Mrs. Leonard and Mrs. Whitney, supplemented\r\nby a ponderous manifesto of Goldwin Smith, and it ended with the same\r\nlist of \"distinguished citizens of Boston opposed to female suffrage,\"\r\nwhich had several times before been brought out from its pigeonhole and\r\ndusted off to terrify those citizens of the United States who did not\r\nreside in Boston.\r\n\r\nAs it was supposed Wyoming would be Republican its admission was\r\nbitterly fought by the Democrats, who used its suffrage clause as a club\r\nto frighten the Republicans, but even those of the latter who were\r\nopposed were willing to swallow woman suffrage for the sake of bringing\r\nin another State for their party. The changes were rung on the old\r\nobjections with the usual interspersing of those equivocal innuendoes\r\nand insinuations which always make a self-respecting woman's blood boil.\r\nThe debate continued many days and it looked for a time as if the woman\r\nsuffrage clause would have to be abandoned if the State were to be\r\nadmitted. When this was announced to the Wyoming Legislature, then in\r\nsession, the answer came back over the wire: \"We will remain out of the\r\nUnion a hundred years rather than come in without woman suffrage.\"[67]\r\nAfter every possible effort had been made to strike out the\r\nobjectionable clause, the final vote was taken March 26, 1890; for\r\nadmission 139; against, 127.\r\n\r\nThe bill was presented in the Senate by Orville H. Platt, of\r\nConnecticut, from the Committee on Territories, and discussed for three\r\ndays. After a repetition of the contest in the House, the vote was taken\r\nJune 27; in favor of admission 29; opposed 18. Woman suffrage clubs in\r\nall parts of the country, in response to an official request by Miss\r\nAnthony and Lucy Stone, celebrated the Fourth of July with great\r\nrejoicing over the admission of Wyoming, the first State to enfranchise\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nAnother event of importance during 1890, was the first majority report\r\nfrom the judiciary committee of the House of Representatives in favor of\r\nthe Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which should\r\nconfer suffrage upon women. Hon. Ezra B. Taylor, of Warren, O., was\r\nchairman of the committee and had exerted all his influence to secure\r\nthis report, which was presented May 29 by L. B. Caswell, of\r\nWisconsin.[68] On August 12, the Senate committee on woman suffrage\r\nagain presented a majority report for a Sixteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Our country needs the vote of her best\r\ncitizens--women--E. B. Taylor.\"]\r\n\r\nIt had long been Miss Anthony's earnest desire to have suffrage\r\nheadquarters in Washington, pleasant parlors where local meetings could\r\nbe held and friends gather in a social way. In the midst of her great\r\nwork and responsibility she exchanged many letters during 1890 with\r\nladies in that city regarding this project, but it was finally decided\r\nthat it would not be judicious to incur the expense. Out of this\r\nagitation, however, was evolved a stock company, incorporated under the\r\nname of Wimodaughsis, organized for the education of women in art,\r\nscience, literature and political and domestic economy by means of\r\nclasses and lectures. As Miss Anthony never gave herself to any work\r\nexcept that which tended directly to secure suffrage for women, she took\r\nno part in the new enterprise except to bestow upon it her blessing and\r\n$100. Rev. Anna Shaw was elected its first president. The\r\nNational-American Association took two large rooms in the new club house\r\nfor headquarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Harriet Taylor Upson (Signed \"Faithfully Yours Harriet\r\nTaylor Winston\")]\r\n\r\nTwo deaths in 1890 affected Miss Anthony most deeply. Ellen H. Sheldon,\r\nof Washington, for a number of years had served as national recording\r\nsecretary and had endeared herself to all. She was a clerk in the War\r\nDepartment and her entire time outside business hours was devoted to\r\ngratuitous work for the association. Her reports were accurate and\r\ndiscriminating and Miss Anthony felt in her death the loss of a\r\nvalued friend and helper. Julia T. Foster, of Philadelphia, who passed\r\naway November 16, was as dear to her as one of her own nieces. A sweet\r\nand beautiful woman, wealthy and accomplished, she was so modest and\r\nretiring that her work for suffrage and the large sums of money she\r\ncontributed were known only to her most intimate friends. In remembrance\r\nRachel Foster Avery sent Miss Anthony all the handsome furnishings of\r\nher sister's room.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony arrived in Washington January 3, 1891, and received the\r\nusual welcome by Mr. and Mrs. Spofford. On the 24th she went to Boston\r\nin response to an invitation to attend the Massachusetts Suffrage\r\nConvention.[69] She reached the Parker House Sunday morning, but Wm.\r\nLloyd Garrison came at once and took her to his hospitable home in\r\nBrookline, and a most fortunate thing it was. Since leaving South Dakota\r\nshe had been fighting off what seemed to be a persistent form of la\r\ngrippe and the next morning she collapsed utterly, pneumonia threatened\r\nand she was obliged to keep her room for a week. She received the most\r\nloving attention from her hostess, Ellen Wright Garrison, and had many\r\ncalls and numerous pleasant letters, among them the following:\r\n\r\n     What a mercy it was that you fell into the shelter and care of the\r\n     Garrisons when so serious an illness came upon you. Of course\r\n     everybody was disappointed that you could not be at the meeting so\r\n     that they might at least see you. Now that you are convalescing and\r\n     we trust on the high road to recovery we want to arrange an\r\n     informal reception at our office, so that those or some of those\r\n     who were sorry not to see you at the meeting, may have a chance to\r\n     do so. I was too tired today to go with my two, and maybe you would\r\n     have been too tired to see us if we had gone. It is not quite the\r\n     same when we are seventy-two as when we are twenty-seven; still I\r\n     am glad of what is left, and wish we might both hold out till the\r\n     victory we have sought is won, but all the same the victory is\r\n     coming. In the aftertime the world will be the better for it.\r\n\r\n     Trusting you may soon be well again, I am your fellow-worker,\r\n\r\n                                             LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\nHer old comrade, Parker Pillsbury, urged her to come for a while to his\r\nhome in Concord, N. H., saying: \"Should you come you may be sure of a\r\nmost cordial greeting in this household, and by others; but by none more\r\nheartily and cordially than by your old friend and coadjutor in the\r\ntemperance, anti-slavery and suffrage enterprises.\" Mrs. Pillsbury\r\nsupplemented this with a pressing invitation; and another came from the\r\nloved and faithful friend, Armenia S. White. Miss Anthony appreciated\r\nthe kindness but there was too much work awaiting her in Washington to\r\nallow of visiting, and thither she hastened even before she was fully\r\nable to travel.\r\n\r\nThe first triennial meeting of the National Woman's Council, Frances E.\r\nWillard, president, Susan B. Anthony, vice-president, began in Albaugh's\r\nOpera House, February 22, 1891, and continued four days. It was as\r\nnotable a gathering as the great International Council of 1888. Forty\r\norganizations of women were represented; \"one,\" said Miss Willard in her\r\nopening address, \"for every year during which this noble woman at my\r\nright and her colleagues have been at work.\" The meeting was preceded by\r\na reception tendered by Mrs. Spofford at the Riggs to 500 guests. The\r\nservices for two Sundays were conducted entirely by women, Revs. Anna\r\nShaw, Anna Garlin Spencer, Ida C. Hultin, Caroline J. Bartlett, Amanda\r\nDeyo, Olympia Brown, Mila Tupper and, among the laity, Margaret Bottome,\r\npresident of the King's Daughters, and Miss Willard. The most famous\r\nwomen of the United States took part in this council. Especial interest\r\nwas centered in the beautiful Mrs. Bertha Honoré Palmer, president of\r\nthe Board of Lady Managers of the Columbian Exposition, who occupied a\r\nseat on the stage. This board was represented also by its\r\nvice-president, Mrs. Ellen M. Henrotin and by Mrs. Virginia C. Meredith.\r\nEach great national organization sent its most representative women to\r\npresent its objects and its work.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Stanton was still in Europe, her paper, \"The Matriarchate,\" was\r\nread by Miss Anthony. Miss Willard introduced the reader in her own\r\ngraceful way, saying: \"I will not call her Mrs. Stanton's faithful\r\nAchates, for that would fail to express it, but will say that the paper\r\nwritten by one of the double stars of the first magnitude will be read\r\nby the other star.\" Miss Anthony was so happy over this great\r\nassemblage, the direct result of all her long years' work for the\r\nevolution of woman into a larger life and a catholicity of spirit which\r\nwould enable those of all creeds, all political beliefs and all lines of\r\nwork to come together in fraternal council, that she herself scarcely\r\ncould be persuaded to make even the briefest address. Her one anxiety\r\nwas that all the noted speakers present should be seen and heard.[70]\r\nThe council was received by Mrs. Harrison at the White House.\r\n\r\nThe Twenty-third Annual Convention of the National-American W. S. A.\r\ncommenced the morning after the council closed, and the vast audiences\r\nwhich filled the opera house at every session hardly knew when one ended\r\nand the other began. The interest was sufficient to sell the boxes for\r\nthe latter at $10, and single seats at 50 cents. Miss Anthony presided\r\nand read Mrs. Stanton's fine address, \"The Degradation of\r\nDisfranchisement,\" saying as she commenced that \"they might imagine how\r\nevery moment she was wishing they could see, instead of her own, the\r\nsunny face and grand white head of the writer.\" At its close she\r\nintroduced Lucy Stone, who came forward amid great applause, and said\r\nthat \"while this was the first time she had stood beside Miss Anthony at\r\na suffrage convention in Washington, she had stood beside her on many a\r\nhard-fought battlefield before most of those present were born.\" She\r\nthen gave a graphic picture of the work accomplished by the suffrage\r\nadvocates from 1850 to 1890.\r\n\r\nAll sections of the United States were represented at this convention;\r\ndelegates were present from Canada, and Miss Florence Balgarnie, of\r\nLondon, spoke for the women of England.[71] Mrs. Henrotin presented an\r\nofficial invitation from the Board of Lady Managers for the association\r\nto take part in the Woman's Congress to be held during the World's Fair.\r\nThe newspapers of Washington, and those of other cities through their\r\ncorrespondents, gave columns of reports, indisputable evidence of the\r\nimportant and stable position now secured by the question of woman\r\nsuffrage. The board of officers was re-elected, Mrs. Stanton receiving\r\nfor president 144 of the 175 votes; Miss Anthony's election unanimous.\r\n\r\nThe Women's Suffrage Society of England had sent official\r\ncongratulations on the admission of Wyoming with enfranchisement for\r\nwomen, and Miss Anthony was determined they should be read in the United\r\nStates Senate. This letter from Senator Blair will show how it was\r\naccomplished: \"The memorial of congratulation which you sent me is not\r\none which I could press for presentation as a matter of right, but\r\nfortunately, by a pious fraud, I succeeded in reading it without\r\ninterruption, so that it will appear word for word in the Record, and it\r\nis referred to the noble army of martyrs known as the committee on woman\r\nsuffrage.\"\r\n\r\nAt a delightful breakfast given by Sorosis at Delmonico's on its\r\ntwenty-third birthday, Miss Anthony was the guest of honor, seated at\r\nthe right of the president, Mrs. Ella Dietz Clymer, and in her short\r\naddress recalled the fact that she had known Mrs. Clymer and their\r\nincoming president, Dr. Jennie de la M. Lozier, when they were no taller\r\nthan the table.\r\n\r\nShe gave a Sunday afternoon reception at the Riggs to Mrs. Annie Besant,\r\nof London, and in his letter regretting that absence from the city would\r\nprevent his attendance, ex-Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch\r\nsaid: \"I am sorry I can not see you often. I have been for many years a\r\n'looker on' and I appreciate the work which you have done for the\r\nbenefit of the race. You have not labored in vain and you have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that your good work will follow you.\" She\r\naccepted a cordial invitation to dine at his home and received assurance\r\nof his thorough belief in suffrage for women.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Sincerely Yours, Hugh McCulloch\"]\r\n\r\nEaster Sunday she went to Philadelphia to witness the christening, or\r\nconsecration, of the Foster-Avery baby, by Rev. Anna Shaw, who had\r\nmarried the father and mother. On Monday Mrs. Avery gave a reception for\r\nher in the parlors of the New Century Club, and on the following day she\r\naddressed the 1,600 girls of the Normal School.\r\n\r\nShe made this entry in her diary May 1: \"Left Washington and the dear\r\nold Riggs House today. For twelve winters this has been my home, where I\r\nhave had every comfort it was possible for Mr. and Mrs. Spofford to\r\ngive. For as many winters it has been the National Association's\r\nheadquarters, but now both will have to find a new place, for the hotel\r\nis to pass under another management.\" Miss Anthony reached home the next\r\nday, and by the 12th was on hand for the State convention at Warren, O.,\r\nthe guest as usual of Mr. and Mrs. Upton at the home of Hon. Ezra B.\r\nTaylor. From here she went to Painesville, where she was entertained at\r\nthe handsome residence of General J. S. and Mrs. Frances M. Casement,\r\nwhose hospitality she had enjoyed for many years whenever her\r\njourneyings took her to that city.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days at home Miss Anthony started for Meriden, to attend the\r\nConnecticut convention on May 22, and when this was over went home with\r\nMrs. Hooker. A letter to the Woman's Tribune said:\r\n\r\n     I wish I could tell you of my journeyings. I had a pleasant visit\r\n     with Mrs. Hooker at her charming home in Hartford. En route from\r\n     Boston I spent a few days with Hon. and Mrs. William Whiting in\r\n     their beautiful home at Holyoke. One day was devoted to a luncheon\r\n     party of a hundred or more in their picturesque log cabin three\r\n     miles down the river, through the lovely Connecticut valley. This\r\n     cabin, with fireplace worthy the grandest old back-log and\r\n     fore-stick, polished floors, and lunch served by a Springfield\r\n     caterer, is not like those of our dear old grandmothers. After the\r\n     tables were cleared, Mrs. Whiting called on me for a talk. Another\r\n     day we visited Mount Holyoke Seminary, going through the various\r\n     buildings and, in the great old kitchen, looking upon neat plateaus\r\n     of light, sweet-smelling bread, biscuits and cake, all made by the\r\n     girls during the morning. Each must do a certain amount of work,\r\n     and all is done in memory of the sainted Mary Lyon, whose monument\r\n     stands under the grand old trees which surround the buildings.\r\n\r\n     Then on Sunday I went to Cheshire, to dine with my mother's dear\r\n     cousin, ninety-five years of age, bright and cheerful in her\r\n     on-look. Next I hied me to the house of my Grandfather Anthony, who\r\n     lived in it from the day of his marriage in 1792, to his death at\r\n     the age of ninety-six.... From here I went to Saratoga and took a\r\n     drink from the old Congress Spring, and Wednesday reached home. The\r\n     paper tells you what happened on Thursday evening, and now I am\r\n     enjoying to the fullest all the good-will of my dear friends.\r\n\r\n\"What happened\" was that Miss Anthony went to housekeeping! After the\r\nmother's death, Miss Mary rented the lower part of the house, which now\r\nbelonged to her, reserved the upper rooms for herself and sister, and\r\ntook her meals with her tenants. This plan was followed for a number of\r\nyears. Now, however, Miss Anthony had passed one year beyond the\r\nthreescore and ten which are supposed to mark the limit of activity if\r\nnot of life, and her friends urged that she should give up her long\r\njourneys from one end of the continent to the other, her hard State\r\ncampaigns, her constant lectures and conventions. She felt as vigorous\r\nas ever but had long wished for the comforts and conveniences of her own\r\nhome, and she concluded that perhaps her friends were right and she\r\nshould settle down in one place and direct the work, rather than try to\r\ndo so much of it herself. She thought this might be safely done now, as\r\nso many new and efficient workers had been developed and the cause had\r\nacquired a standing which made its advocacy an easy task compared to\r\nwhat it had been in the past, when only a few women had the courage and\r\nstrength to take the blows and bear the contumely. So Miss Mary took\r\npossession of the house; masons, carpenters, painters and paper-hangers\r\nwere put to work, and by June all was in in beautiful readiness.\r\n\r\nThe friends in various parts of the country were deeply interested in\r\nthe new move. Letters of approval came from all directions, among them\r\nthis from Mrs. Stanton in England: \"I rejoice that you are going to\r\nhousekeeping. The mistake of my life was selling Tenafly. My advice to\r\nyou, Susan, is to keep some spot you can call your own; where you can\r\nlive and die in peace and be cremated in your own oven if you desire.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Anthony returned from her eastern trip on June 11, a pleasant\r\nsurprise awaited her. The Political Equality Club had taken part in the\r\nhousekeeping program. Handsome rugs had been laid on the floor, lace\r\ncurtains hung at the windows, easy chairs placed in the rooms, a large\r\ndesk in Miss Mary's study, a fine oak table in the dining-room, all the\r\ngift of the club. Mrs. Avery had sent a big, roomy desk and Mrs. Sewall\r\nan office chair for Miss Anthony's study; Miss Shaw and Lucy Anthony, a\r\nset of china; Mr. Avery, the needed cutlery; the brother Daniel R., a\r\ngreat box of sheeting, spreads, bolts of muslin, table linen and towels,\r\nenough to last a lifetime. From other friends came pictures, silver and\r\nbric-a-brac without limit. The events of the evening after Miss Anthony\r\narrived at home are thus described by the Rochester Herald:\r\n\r\n     The truth of the matter is that for a long time the Woman's\r\n     Political Club has been in love with Miss Anthony, a feeling which\r\n     she has not been slow to reciprocate. The affair culminated last\r\n     evening, the nuptial ceremony being a housewarming tendered by the\r\n     club. The reception was a complete success, and the rooms were\r\n     crowded for several hours, the number of visitors being estimated\r\n     at no less than 300. The house was brilliantly lighted and\r\n     everywhere was a profusion of cut flowers and potted ferns. At the\r\n     entrance the visitors were greeted by Mrs. Greenleaf, president of\r\n     the club, who presented them to Miss Anthony. In greeting each\r\n     new-comer the hostess displayed her remarkable power of memory and\r\n     brilliance as a conversationalist, having a reminiscent word for\r\n     every one. In the parlor before the fireplace stood the old\r\n     spinning-wheel which in 1817 had been a wedding gift to her mother.\r\n     It was decked with marguerites and received no small degree of\r\n     attention....\r\n\r\nA short time after the housewarming, her cousin, Charles Dickinson, of\r\nChicago, stopped over night and, after he had gone, Miss Anthony found\r\nthis note: \"It makes me blush for the wealthy people of the country,\r\nthat they forget their duty to others. Here art thou, with thy moderate\r\nincome, spending all of it for humanity's cause, thinking, speaking,\r\ndoing a work that will last forever. Please take rest enough for good\r\nhealth to be with thee, and to make this easier I enclose a check for\r\n$300. Call it a loan without interest, already repaid by the good done\r\nto our fellow-beings.\"\r\n\r\nIn June she made a long-promised visit to her friend Henrietta M. Banker\r\nat her home in the Adirondacks, which she thus describes:\r\n\r\n     Rev. Anna Shaw and I have had a lovely week. Almost every day we\r\n     drove out among the mountains; one day to the Ausable lakes,\r\n     through beautiful woods, up ravines a thousand feet; another to\r\n     Professor Davidson's summer school, high up on the mountainside.\r\n     But the day of days was when we drove to the farm-home of old\r\n     Captain John Brown at North Elba. We found a broad plateau,\r\n     surrounded with mountain peaks on every side. We ate our dinner in\r\n     the same dining-room in which the old hero and his family partook\r\n     of their scanty fare in the days when he devoted his energies to\r\n     teaching the colored men, who accepted Gerrit Smith's generous\r\n     offer of a bit of real estate, which should entitle the possessor\r\n     to a right to vote. Of all who settled on those lands, called the\r\n     \"John Brown opening,\" only one grayheaded negro still lives, though\r\n     many of their old houses and barns yet stand, crumbling away on\r\n     their deserted farms.\r\n\r\n     In front of the house is a small yard and occupying one-half of it\r\n     is a grand old boulder with steps leading to the top, where one\r\n     sees chiseled in large letters, \"John Brown, December 2, 1859.\" At\r\n     the foot is the grave of the martyr, marked by an old granite\r\n     headstone which once stood at his grandfather's grave, and on it\r\n     are inscribed the names of three generations of John Browns. The\r\n     vandals visiting that sacred spot chipped off bits of the granite\r\n     until it became necessary to make a cover and padlock it down, so\r\n     that the farmer unlocks the cap and lifts it off for visitors now.\r\n     Thus is commemorated that fatal day which marks the only hanging\r\n     for treason against the United States Government. John Brown was\r\n     crucified for doing what he believed God commanded him to do, \"to\r\n     break the yoke and let the oppressed go free,\" precisely as were\r\n     the saints of old for following what they believed to be God's\r\n     commands. The barbarism of our government was by so much the\r\n     greater as our light and knowledge are greater than those of two\r\n     thousand years ago....\r\n\r\n     July 25 is to be Suffrage Day at Chautauqua, and dear Mrs. Wallace\r\n     and Anna Shaw are to preach the gospel of equal rights. I do hope\r\n     Bishop Vincent will be present and there learn from those two, who\r\n     are surely \"God's women,\" the law of love to thy neighbor--woman,\r\n     as to thyself--man. I am hoping the gate receipts on that day will\r\n     be greater than those of any other during the summer. Wouldn't that\r\n     tell the story of the interest in this question?\r\n\r\nIn June she accepted the urgent invitation of the Ignorance Club to\r\nhonor them by being their guest at their annual frolic on Manitou beach\r\nand respond to a toast which should allow her to say anything she liked.\r\nThree most enjoyable weeks were spent at home and during this time Miss\r\nAnthony addressed the W. C. T. U. She expressed herself in no uncertain\r\ntones as to the futility of third parties, declaring that the\r\nProhibition party already had taken some of the best temperance men out\r\nof Congress, and made a speech so forcible that it lifted the bonnets of\r\nsome of the timid sisters. The evening paper reported:\r\n\r\n     ... Rev. C. B. Gardner said Miss Anthony had given the company some\r\n     excellent political advice, but he inclined to the belief that the\r\n     temperance reform could be brought about without woman suffrage.\r\n     \"The women would bring the men around in time; they could\r\n     accomplish much by their moral influence; in this they resembled\r\n     ministers.\" Miss Anthony wished to know if it would not be a good\r\n     thing then, to disfranchise the ministers and let them depend\r\n     entirely on their moral influence. She explained that in what she\r\n     had said about prayer she meant prayer by action. She would not\r\n     have it understood that she did not believe in prayer; she thought,\r\n     however, that an emotion never could be equal to an action.\r\n\r\nShe went to Chautauqua July 25, when, for the first time in its history,\r\nwoman suffrage was presented. Zerelda G. Wallace delivered a grand\r\naddress and Rev. Anna Shaw gave \"The Fate of Republics.\" Miss Anthony\r\nfollowed in a short speech, and the Jamestown Sunday News said: \"Woman's\r\nDay was fully justified by the reception given to that intrepid Arnold\r\nWinkelreid of women.\" Frances Willard wrote a few days later from the\r\nassembly grounds: \"Dearest Susan, I could sing hallelujah over you and\r\nour Anna Shaw and 'Deborah' Wallace! It was the best and biggest day\r\nChautauqua ever saw. Do urge your suffragists to go in for this on next\r\nyear's program.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony attended the golden wedding of John and Isabella Beecher\r\nHooker, in Hartford, August 5; \"a most beautiful occasion,\" she writes\r\nin her diary, \"but to the surprise of all there was no speaking.\" An\r\naffair without speeches was to her what a feast without wine would have\r\nbeen to the ancients. On the 15th suffrage had a great day at Lily\r\nDale, the famous Spiritualist camp meeting grounds, Miss Shaw and\r\nherself making the principal addresses. Miss Anthony thus speaks of the\r\nmeeting in a letter:\r\n\r\n     ... To Brother Buckley's assertion, made a short time before, that\r\n     women should not be allowed to vote because the majority of\r\n     Spiritualists, Christian Scientists and all false religions were\r\n     women, Miss Shaw replied that there was a larger ratio of men in\r\n     the audience before her than she had seen in any Methodist or\r\n     temperance camp meeting or Chautauqua assembly this summer. When\r\n     Mr. Buckley charged that women were too numerous in the false\r\n     religions to vote, she would remind him that there were three women\r\n     to one man in the Methodist church also; and she was quite willing\r\n     to match the vast majorities of women in the various religions,\r\n     false and true, with the vast majorities of men at the horse races,\r\n     variety theaters, police stations, jails and penitentiaries\r\n     throughout the country. She brought the house down with, \"Too much\r\n     religion unfits women to vote! Too much vice and crime qualifies\r\n     men to vote!\"\r\n\r\n     People came from far and near. Fully 3,000 were assembled in that\r\n     beautiful amphitheater decorated with the yellow and the red, white\r\n     and blue.... There hanging by itself was our national suffrage\r\n     flag, ten by fourteen feet, with its regulation red and white\r\n     stripes, and in the center of its blue corner just one great golden\r\n     star, Wyoming, blazing out all alone. Every cottage in the camp was\r\n     festooned with yellow, and when at night the Chinese lanterns on\r\n     the piazzas were lighted, Lily Dale was as gorgeous as any Fourth\r\n     of July, all in honor of Woman's Day and her coming freedom and\r\n     equality.\r\n\r\n     Our hosts, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Skidmore, are the center of things\r\n     at Lily Dale, and right royal are they in their hospitality as well\r\n     as their love of liberty for all. This camp has been in existence\r\n     twelve summers, there has been no police force, and no disturbance\r\n     ever has occurred. Every one is left to his own sense of propriety\r\n     of behavior and every one behaves properly.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony still intended, however, to remain at home and in the\r\nintervals when she was not coaxed away no bride ever enjoyed more fully\r\nher first experiment at housekeeping. All the forty years of travelling\r\nup and down the face of the earth had not eradicated from her nature the\r\ndomestic tastes, and she loved every nook and corner of the old home\r\nmade new, going from room to room, putting the finishing touches here\r\nand there, and fairly revelling in the sense of possession. Hospitality\r\nwas her strongest instinct, and during all these years she had accepted\r\nso much from her friends in Rochester and elsewhere without being able\r\nto return it, that now she wanted to entertain everybody and all at\r\nonce. The diary speaks often of ten and twelve at the table for dinner\r\nor tea, and Miss Mary, who constituted the committee of ways and means,\r\nwas quite overwhelmed with the new regime. The story in the journal runs\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n     Our dear old friends, Sarah Willis and Mary Hallowell, shared our\r\n     first Sunday dinner with us.... Our old Abolition friends, Giles B.\r\n     and Catharine F. Stebbins and three or four others took tea with us\r\n     tonight.... My old friend Adeline Thomson has come to stay several\r\n     weeks with us. How nice to have my own home to entertain my\r\n     friends.... Anna Shaw and niece Lucy came today and we had five\r\n     others to dinner. A very pleasant thing to be able to ask people to\r\n     stop and dine.... Brother D. R., sister Anna and niece Maud came\r\n     today for a week. It is so good to receive them in our own home. D.\r\n     R. enjoys the fire on the hearth.... Had Maria Porter, Mr. and Mrs.\r\n     Greenleaf and eleven altogether to tea this evening. How I do enjoy\r\n     it!... Who came this day? O, yes, Mrs. Lydia Avery Coonley, of\r\n     Chicago, her son and her mother, Mrs. Susan Look Avery, of\r\n     Louisville, Ky. It makes me so happy to return some of the\r\n     courtesies I have had in their beautiful home.... Just before noon\r\n     Mrs. Greenleaf popped into the woodshed with a great sixteen-quart\r\n     pail full of pound balls of the most delicious butter, and we made\r\n     her stay to dinner. The girl was washing and I got the dinner\r\n     alone: broiled steak, potatoes, sweet corn, tomatoes and peach\r\n     pudding, with a cup of tea. All said it was good and I enjoyed it\r\n     hugely. How I love to receive in my own home and at my own table!\r\n\r\nShe went to Warsaw September 17 to help the Wyoming county women hold\r\ntheir convention. The 23d had been set apart as Woman's Day at the\r\nWestern New York Fair, held at the Rochester driving park. Mrs.\r\nGreenleaf presided; Miss Anthony and Rev. Anna Shaw were the speakers.\r\nThe former spoke briefly, insisting with her usual generosity that the\r\nhonors of the occasion should belong to Miss Shaw.[72] In the course of\r\nher few remarks she said: \"We who represent the suffrage movement ask\r\nnot that women be like men, but that they may be greater women by having\r\ntheir opinions respected at the ballot-box. Only men's opinions have\r\nprevailed in this government since it was founded. Enfranchisement says\r\nto every man outside of the State prisons, the insane and idiot asylums:\r\n'Your judgment is sound; your opinions are worthy of being crystallized\r\nin the laws of the land.' Disfranchisement says to all women: 'Your\r\njudgment is not sound; your opinions are not worthy of being counted,'\r\nMan is the superior, woman the subject, under the present condition of\r\npolitical affairs, and until this great wrong is righted, ignorant men\r\nand small boys will continue to look with disdain on the opinion of\r\nwomen.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Mrs. Stanton had decided to return to America for the\r\nremainder of her days, Miss Anthony had hoped they might have a home\r\ntogether and finish their life-work of history and reminiscence. When\r\nshe learned that her friend, with a widowed daughter and a bachelor son,\r\ncontemplated taking a house in New York, she was greatly distressed, as\r\nshe felt that this would be the end of all her plans. She wrote her\r\nimmediately:\r\n\r\n     We have just returned from the Unitarian church where we listened\r\n     to Mr. Gannett's rare dissertation on the religion of Lowell; but\r\n     all the time there was an inner wail in my soul, that by your\r\n     fastening yourself in New York City I couldn't help you carry out\r\n     the dream of my life--which is that you should take all of your\r\n     speeches and articles, carefully dissect them, and put your best\r\n     utterances on each point into one essay or lecture; first deliver\r\n     them in the Unitarian church on Sunday afternoon, and then publish\r\n     in a nice volume, just as Phillips culled out his best. Your\r\n     Reminiscences give only light and incidental bits of your life--all\r\n     good but not the greatest of yourself. This is the first time since\r\n     1850 that I have anchored myself to any particular spot, and in\r\n     doing it my constant thought was that you would come here, where\r\n     are the documents necessary to our work, and stay for as long, at\r\n     least, as we must be together to put your writings into systematic\r\n     shape to go down to posterity. I have no writings to go down, so my\r\n     ambition is not for myself, but it is for one by the side of whom I\r\n     have wrought these forty years, and to get whose speeches before\r\n     audiences and committees has been the delight of my life.\r\n\r\n     Well, I hope you will do and be as seemeth best unto yourself,\r\n     still I can not help sending you this inner groan of my soul, lest\r\n     you are not going to make it possible that the thing shall be done\r\n     first which seems most important to me. Then, too, I have never\r\n     ceased to hope that we would finish the History of Woman Suffrage,\r\n     at least to the end of the life of the dear old National.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton's children would not consent to this plan, but she came to\r\nRochester for a month's visit in September. It was desired by many\r\nfriends that to the very satisfactory busts of Miss Anthony and Lucretia\r\nMott, which had been made by Adelaide Johnson, should be added one of\r\nMrs. Stanton, and all be placed in the Woman's Building at the World's\r\nFair. To accomplish this Miss Anthony rented a large room in the\r\nadjoining house for a studio and invited the sculptor to her home for a\r\nnumber of weeks, until the sittings were finished.\r\n\r\nDuring Mrs. Stanton's visit Miss Anthony entertained the Political\r\nEquality Club and a large company of guests, the evening being devoted\r\nto the subject of the admission of women to Rochester University. A\r\nnumber of the faculty, Congressmen Greenleaf and Baker, several\r\nministers, the principal of the free academy--about 200 altogether were\r\npresent and the discussion was very animated. Practically all of them\r\nbelieved in opening the doors and a letter of approval was read from\r\nDavid J. Hill, president of the university. The trustees were\r\nrepresented by Dr. E. M. Moore, who was in favor of admitting women but\r\ndeclared that it would be impossible unless an additional fund of\r\n$200,000 was provided beforehand. Miss Anthony insisted that the girls\r\nshould first be admitted and then, when a necessity for more money was\r\napparent, it would be much easier to raise it. In the course of his\r\nremarks Dr. Moore said it was more important to educate boys than girls\r\nbecause they were the breadwinners.\r\n\r\nThe Utica Sunday paper came out a few days later with a half-page\r\ncartoon representing the university campus; on the outside of the fence\r\nwere Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton heading a long procession of girls,\r\nbooks in hand; standing guard over the fence, labeled \"prejudice and old\r\nfogyism,\" was Dr. Moore pointing proudly to the \"breadwinners,\" who\r\nconsisted of two confused and struggling masses, one engaged in a \"cane\r\nrush\" and the other in a fight over a football. This little incident\r\nmerely proved the oft-repeated assertion that these two women never were\r\nthree days together without stirring up a controversy, in which the\r\nopposing forces invariably were worsted and public sentiment was moved\r\nup a notch in the direction of larger liberty for woman.\r\n\r\nTogether they visited the palatial home, at Auburn, of Eliza Wright\r\nOsborne, daughter of Martha C. Wright, where they were joined by\r\nElizabeth Smith Miller, daughter of Gerrit Smith; and there were\r\ndelightful hours of reminiscence and chat of mutual friends, past and\r\npresent. The diary shows that Miss Anthony purchased a full set of books\r\nto join the Emerson and Browning classes this year, but there is no\r\nrecord of attendance save at one meeting. One entry says: \"Dancing to\r\nthe dentist's these days.\" Another tells of forgetting to go to a\r\nluncheon after the invitation had been accepted; and still another of\r\ninviting a number of friends to tea and forgetting all about it.\r\n\r\nIn November she went again to Auburn to the State convention, remaining\r\nfour days. The Daily Advertiser said: \"Miss Susan B. Anthony, the grand\r\nold woman of the equal rights cause, was then introduced and spoke at\r\nlength upon the objects for which she had labored so faithfully all her\r\nlife. Except for her gray hair and a few wrinkles, no one would suppose\r\nthe speaker to be in her seventy-second year. The full, firm voice, the\r\nactive manner and clear logic, all belonged to a young woman.\" At the\r\nclose of the convention Mrs. Osborne gave a reception in her honor,\r\nattended by nearly one hundred ladies.\r\n\r\nBy invitation of the Unitarian minister, Rev. W. C. Gannett, Miss\r\nAnthony participated with himself and Rabbi Max Lansberg in Thanksgiving\r\nservices at the Unitarian church. The topic was \"The Unrest of the Times\r\na Cause for Thankfulness,\" as indicated by \"The Woman, the Social and\r\nthe Religious Movements.\" Miss Anthony responded to the first in a\r\nconcise address, considered under twelve heads and not occupying more\r\nthan that number of minutes in delivery, beginning with Ralph Waldo\r\nEmerson's declaration, \"A wholesome discontent is the first step toward\r\nprogress,\" and giving a resume of women's advancement during the past\r\nforty years, due chiefly to dissatisfaction with their lot.\r\n\r\nIt had not been an easy matter for Miss Anthony to have even this\r\nfragment of a year at home. From many places she had received letters\r\nbegging her to come to the assistance of societies and conventions, and\r\nshe was just as anxious to go as they were to have her. The most urgent\r\nof these appeals came from Mrs. Johns, of Kansas, where a constitutional\r\nconvention was threatened and the women wanted a suffrage amendment.\r\nWhen Miss Anthony did not go to the spring convention, Mrs. Johns wrote,\r\nApril 18: \"I can never tell you how I missed you, and the people--they\r\nseemed to think they must have you. Letter after letter came asking, 'Is\r\nthere no way by which we can get Miss Anthony?'\" When she declined to go\r\nto the fall convention, Mrs. Johns wrote, November 26: \"I declare it\r\nseemed as if I did not know how to go on without you, and our women felt\r\njust as I did. We have had you with us so often that we depended on your\r\npresence more than we knew.\" In another long letter she said:\r\n\r\n     I hope the national association will not leave Kansas to work out\r\n     her own salvation. Surely you, to whom we owe municipal suffrage,\r\n     are not going to fail to come to us at this awful juncture! Dear\r\n     Aunt Susan, you won't get any wounds here. I will take charge of\r\n     the office and make the routes, which I am able to do well; I will\r\n     speak; I will organize; I will do anything you think best, and\r\n     there will be nobody inquiring what you do with funds, and there\r\n     will be no disgraceful charges and counter-charges, unless I am\r\n     greatly mistaken in Kansas women and in myself. We all love you\r\n     here and we want the cause to succeed more than we want personal\r\n     aggrandizement.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns persuaded Mrs. Avery to join in her plea and finally Miss\r\nAnthony could hold out no longer, but December 11 wrote to the latter:\r\n\"I have been fully resolved all along not to go to Kansas during this\r\nfirst campaign, because I felt that my threescore and ten and two years\r\nadded ought to excuse me from the fearful exposure; still, since you and\r\ndear Laura are left so deserted and will be so heartbroken if I stick to\r\nmy resolve, I will say yes, tuck on my coat and mittens and start. But\r\nalas! how soon must that be? I am thoroughly in the dark as to when and\r\nwhere I shall be wanted to begin, but I will do my level best.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Very truly yours, Frances E Warren\"]\r\n\r\nThe closing days of 1891 were devoted to the voluminous correspondence\r\nwhich preceded every national convention. The large number of letters on\r\nfile from prominent senators and representatives show that Miss Anthony\r\nwas keeping an eye on the committees and pulling the wires to have known\r\nfriends placed on those which would report on woman suffrage. \"I am in\r\nfull sympathy with you upon the question of woman's enfranchisement,\"\r\nwrote Senator Dolph, of Oregon, \"and also with your effort to secure a\r\nchairman of the committee who favors the movement and is able to present\r\nit with intelligence and ability.\" Speaker Reed closed his letter by\r\nsaying, \"When the eleventh hour comes, we all shall flock in, clamorous\r\nfor pennies.\" Words of encouragement were received from many others, and\r\nSenator and ex-Governor Francis E. Warren, of Wyoming, wrote: \"I am\r\nalways in harness for woman suffrage wherever I may be. My spoken and\r\nwritten testimony for a score of years has been in its praise and of its\r\nperfect working and results in Wyoming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[66] While here Miss Anthony received a letter from Rev. N. M. Mann,\r\nformerly pastor of the Unitarian church in Rochester but now residing in\r\nOmaha, which said: \"Are you not coming to the metropolis of the State,\r\nwhen some of us here are just perishing for the sight of your face? I\r\nspeak for myself and Mrs. Mann firstly, though judging from the number\r\nof parlors I go into where your picture is the first thing one sees, I\r\nfancy there are a good many others who would be hardly less glad than we\r\nto greet you. Come and spend a Sunday, and hear a good old sermon, and\r\nlecture in my church.\"\r\n\r\n[67] As women had been voting in the Territory over twenty years and\r\nthis answer was sent by a legislature composed entirely of men, it would\r\nseem to show that the evils predicted of woman suffrage were wholly\r\ndisproved by actual experience.\r\n\r\n[68] Mr. Taylor wrote Miss Anthony: \"The delay, which seemed long to\r\nyou, was absolutely necessary and I am sure you will understand that I\r\nhave been faithful to the cause. My daughter Harriet, the most wonderful\r\nof all women to me, is largely influential in the result....\"\r\n\r\n[69] DEAR SUSAN ANTHONY: We are to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of\r\nthe First National Woman's Rights Convention in this State and want to\r\nmake the meeting as useful to the cause as we can. You ought to be here.\r\nWill you come? The sheaves gathered in these forty years are to be\r\npresented, and of course there will be some reminiscences of pioneer\r\ntimes. We shall be glad to announce you as one of the speakers. I hope\r\nyou are a little rested since the hard campaign in Dakota. Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                       LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\n[70] In her letter describing the council Mrs. Margaret Bottome wrote of\r\nMiss Anthony: \"I have met, since I have been in Washington, a woman whom\r\nI have heard of since I can remember anything. We are not of the same\r\nfaith--she has devoted her life to what during the past I have shrunk\r\nfrom--and I met her here for the first time; but I shall carry with me\r\nalways the impression of her spirit upon my own, of the Christ-life, the\r\nChrist-spirit. I got it before she had said five words to me, and I\r\ncould have sat down at her feet and drank in the spirit of Jesus Christ\r\nthat is in her, though she does not see him just as I do.\"\r\n\r\n[71] After the convention Miss Balgarnie wrote: \"It has been one of the\r\nmost genuine pleasures of my life to meet you, my dear Miss Anthony. I\r\nfelt 'strength go out of you,' as it were, directly you took my hand.\"\r\n\r\n[72] Miss Anthony was equally generous in regard to speakers of less\r\nrenown. She wrote to Mrs. Blake during this year: \"I felt so happy to\r\ngive half of my hour at Syracuse to Mrs. C., so that splendid audience\r\nmight see and hear her. And I am always glad to surrender my time to any\r\nunknown speakers whom we find promising; but first they ought to have\r\ntried their powers at their home meetings and in rural districts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nIGNORED BY THE PARTIES--APPOINTED TO OFFICE.\r\n\r\n1892.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn her way to the convention of 1892, Miss Anthony stopped in New York\r\nin response to an urgent letter from Mrs. Stanton, now comfortably\r\nensconced in a pleasant flat overlooking Central Park, saying that\r\nunless she came and took her bodily to Washington she should not be able\r\nto go. \"All the influences about me urge to rest rather than action,\"\r\nshe wrote--exactly what Miss Anthony had feared. She was now in her\r\nseventy-seventh year and naturally her children desired that she should\r\ngive up public work; but Miss Anthony knew that inaction meant rust and\r\ndecay and, as her fellow-worker was in the prime of mental vigor, she\r\nwas determined that the world should continue to profit by it. Her\r\naddress this year was entitled \"The Solitude of Self,\" considered by\r\nmany one of her finest papers.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton received a great ovation at the opening session, January\r\n16, but this proved to be her last appearance at a national convention.\r\nFor more than forty years she had presided with a grace and dignity\r\nwhich never had been surpassed, and now she begged that the scepter, or\r\nmore properly speaking the gavel, might be transferred to Miss Anthony,\r\nwhose experience had been quite as extended as her own. The delegates\r\nyielded to her wishes and Miss Anthony was elected national president.\r\nThe office of chairman of the executive committee was abolished; Mrs.\r\nStanton and Lucy Stone were made honorary presidents, and Rev. Anna H.\r\nShaw vice-president-at-large.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony presided over the ten sessions of the convention and they\r\nrequired a firm hand, for the discussions were spirited, as the\r\nquestions considered were important. Among them were the work to be done\r\nat the World's Fair; the opening of the fair on Sunday; the proposition\r\nto hold every alternate convention in some other city than Washington;\r\nthe plan to carry suffrage work into the southern States; the\r\nadvisability of making another campaign in Kansas; and other matters on\r\nwhich there was a wide difference of opinion.\r\n\r\nJohn B. Allen, of Washington, had introduced in the Senate, and Halbert\r\nS. Greenleaf in the House, a joint resolution proposing an amendment to\r\nthe Constitution extending the right to women to vote at all federal\r\nelections. The House Judiciary Committee, January 18, granted a hearing\r\nto such speakers as should be selected by the national convention then\r\nin session. Miss Anthony, Mrs. Stanton, Lucy Stone and Mrs. Hooker were\r\nchosen. This was the first Democratic committee before whom an appeal\r\nhad been made; they listened courteously, but brought in no report on\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nThe Senate committee granted a hearing January 20, and three-minute\r\naddresses were made by eighteen women representing as many States.\r\nBefore they left the room, Senator Hoar moved that the committee make a\r\nfavorable report and the motion was seconded by Senator Warren, Senator\r\nBlair also voting in favor. Senators Vance, of North Carolina, and\r\nGeorge, of Mississippi, voted in the negative. Senators Quay and\r\nCarlisle were absent.\r\n\r\nDuring the convention the district suffrage society gave a reception in\r\nthe parlors of the Wimodaughsis club house. Later, Mrs. Noble, wife of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, issued cards for a reception in honor of\r\nMiss Anthony, Mrs. Stanton and Lucy Stone. It was attended by members of\r\nthe Cabinet, Senate, House, diplomatic corps and many others prominent\r\nin official and social life.\r\n\r\nAs Miss Anthony had no longer her comfortable quarters at the Riggs\r\nHouse free of all expense, she did not linger in Washington, but went to\r\nPhiladelphia for a week with the friends there and reached home\r\nFebruary 6. \"I send congratulations, I always wanted you to be\r\npresident,\" wrote Mrs. Johns. \"Now can't you come to our Kansas City\r\nInter-State Convention? We do need you so and there wouldn't be standing\r\nroom if you were there.\" And later: \"Do any of my wails reach you? The\r\nKansas City people plead for you to come if only to be looked at. Is\r\nthere any hope?\" Miss Anthony was perfectly willing to make a winter\r\ncampaign in Kansas, but her friends insisted that there were plenty of\r\nyounger women to do this work and she should wait till spring. So Anna\r\nShaw, Mary Seymour Howell and Florence Balgarnie, of England, went to\r\nthe assistance of the women there, and Rachel Foster Avery gave $1,000\r\nto this canvass.\r\n\r\nEvery day at home was precious to Miss Anthony. Sometimes on Sunday\r\nafternoon she went to Mount Hope, on whose sloping hillsides rest the\r\nbeloved dead of her own family and many of the friends of early\r\ndays;[73] or she walked down to the long bridge which spans the\r\npicturesque Genesee river and commands a fine view of the beautiful\r\nLower Falls. Occasionally a friend called with a carriage and they took\r\nthe charming seven-mile drive to the shore of Lake Ontario. Sunday\r\nmornings she listened to Mr. Gannett's philosophical sermons; and\r\nthrough the week there were quiet little teas with old friends whom she\r\nhad known since girlhood, but had seen far too seldom in all the busy\r\nyears. Instead of forever giving lectures she was able to hear them from\r\nothers; and she could indulge to the fullest, on the big new desk, her\r\nlove of letter-writing, while the immense work of the national\r\nassociation was always pressing. She had a number of applications for\r\narticles from various magazines and newspapers, but her invariable reply\r\nwas, \"I have no literary ability; ask Mrs. Stanton;\" and no argument\r\ncould convince her that she could write well if she would give the time\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nShe addressed the New York Legislature in April in reference to having\r\nwomen sit as delegates in the approaching Constitutional Convention. In\r\nresponse to a request from the Rochester Union and Advertiser, she wrote\r\nan earnest letter advocating the opening of the World's Fair on Sunday,\r\nand giving many strong reasons in favor. On April 22, she joined Miss\r\nShaw, who was lecturing at Bradford, Penn., and Sunday afternoon\r\naddressed an audience which packed the opera house. The next day she\r\norganized a suffrage club of seventy members among the influential women\r\nof that city. After leaving there Rev. Anna Shaw, herself an ordained\r\nProtestant Methodist minister, wrote her that she had been shut out of\r\nseveral churches because she had addressed an audience at the Lily Dale\r\nSpiritualist camp meeting. She said: \"I told them that I would speak to\r\n5,000 people on woman suffrage anywhere this or the other side of Hades\r\nif they could be got together.\"\r\n\r\nThe first week in May, at the urgent invitation of her good friends,\r\nSmith G. and Emily B. Ketcham, of Grand Rapids, Miss Anthony attended\r\ntheir silver wedding. From this pleasant affair she went to the Michigan\r\nSuffrage Convention at Battle Creek, where she visited an old\r\nschoolmate, Mrs. Sarah Hyatt Nichols. She reached Chicago in time for\r\nthe biennial meeting of the General Federation of Woman's Clubs. Special\r\ntrains were run from New York and Boston, Central Music Hall was crowded\r\nand numerous elegant receptions were given for the 300 delegates from\r\nall parts of the country. Many eminent women sat upon the platform,\r\namong them the president of the federation, Mrs. Charlotte Emerson\r\nBrown, Frances E. Willard, Susan B. Anthony, Julia Ward Howe, May Wright\r\nSewall, Jenny June Croly and Dr. Sarah Hackett Stevenson, all of whom\r\nwere heard at different times during the convention. Miss Anthony was\r\nthe guest of Lydia Avery Coonley, whose mother wrote to Mary Anthony:\r\n\r\n     I have been intending for several days to tell you that however\r\n     your sister may have been regarded forty years ago, she is today\r\n     the most popular woman in these United States. The federation\r\n     closed, as you probably know, on Friday night. During the meetings\r\n     she was several times asked to come forward on the platform, which\r\n     she did to the manifest gratification of the people, saying\r\n     something each time which \"brought down the house.\" On the last\r\n     night a note was sent to the president asking that \"Susan B.,\"\r\n     Julia Ward Howe and Ednah D. Cheney would please step forward. They\r\n     came, but only your sister spoke and what she said was vociferously\r\n     cheered over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe business committee of the National Council--Miss Willard, Mrs.\r\nSewall, Mrs. Foster Avery, Miss Anthony and others--met in Chicago the\r\nsame week, the principal subject of consideration being the Woman's\r\nCongress to be held the next year during the World's Fair. While in the\r\ncity Miss Anthony gave a number of sittings to Lorado Taft, the\r\nsculptor. Miss Willard had asked that he might make the bust to be\r\nplaced in the gallery of famous women at the World's Fair, she herself\r\nto be responsible for all expenses. \"Come and spend a week with me in my\r\nhome,\" she wrote, \"while he prepares a model of that statesmanlike head,\r\nthe greatest of them all.\" Desirous of pleasing her, Miss Anthony\r\nagreed, but at once many of the strong-minded protested that the bust\r\nmust be made by a woman.\r\n\r\nA number of amusing letters were exchanged. From Miss Willard: \"Mr. Taft\r\nis the most progressive believer in woman and admirer of you, dear\r\nSusan, that I know. He is in full sympathy with all of our ideas. I am\r\nsure that as a friend of mine, appreciated by me as highly as you are by\r\nany woman living, you will not place me in the position of declining to\r\nhave this work done. Please do not take counsel of women who are so\r\nprejudiced that, as I once heard said, they would not allow a male\r\ngrasshopper to chirp on their lawn; but out of your own great heart,\r\nrefuse to set an example to such folly.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Taft himself wrote Miss Anthony: \"I can put myself in your place\r\nsufficiently to appreciate in part the objections which you or your\r\nfriends may feel toward having the work done by a man. My only regret is\r\nthat I am not to be allowed to pay this tribute to one whom I was early\r\ntaught to honor and revere.... Come to think of it, I believe I am\r\nprovoked after all. Sex is but an accident, and it seems to me that it\r\nhas no more to do with art than has the artist's complexion or the\r\npolitical party he votes with.\" Again from Miss Willard: \"Do you not\r\nsee, my friend and comrade, that having engaged a noble and large-minded\r\nyoung man, who believes as we do, to make that bust, engaged him in good\r\nfaith and announced it to the public, it is a 'little rough on me,' as\r\nthe boys say, for my dear sister to wish me to break my contract? We can\r\nnot have too many busts of you, so let Miss Johnson go on and make hers,\r\nand let me have mine, and let those other women make theirs, and we will\r\nyet have one of them in the House of Representatives at Washington, the\r\nother in the Senate, the third in the White House!... My dear mother and\r\nAnna wish to be remembered to you, knowing that you are one of our best\r\nand most trusted friends, only I must say that you are a naughty woman\r\nin this matter of the 'statoot.'\" Miss Anthony's common sense finally\r\ninduced her to waive objections and she gave Mr. Taft as many sittings\r\nas he desired. When the work was finished Miss Willard wrote: \"My\r\nbeloved Susan, your statue is perfect. Lady Henry and I think that _one_\r\nman has seen your great, benignant soul and shown it in permanent\r\nmaterial.\"\r\n\r\nThe 25th of May Miss Anthony attended a meeting of the Ohio association\r\nat Salem, where had been held in April, 1850, the second woman's rights\r\nconvention in all history. There was present one of the pioneers who had\r\ncalled that convention, Emily, wife of Marius Robinson, editor of the\r\nAnti-Slavery Bugle. Miss Anthony read her paper for her, as she was over\r\neighty years old, and added her own strong comments, of which the report\r\nof the secretary said: \"Her burning words can never be forgotten, and\r\nmany a soul must have responded to her call for workers to carry to\r\nglorious completion what was begun in such difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nThere was some talk at this time of holding a Southern Woman's Council\r\nand Miss Anthony wrote to the Arkansas Woman's Chronicle:\r\n\r\n     The New England States hold an annual suffrage convention and have\r\n     done so for nearly thirty years, and I do not see any valid reason\r\n     why the States of any section may not have a society or a\r\n     convention. Larger numbers from the six New England States can\r\n     meet and help each other in Boston, than could possibly go to\r\n     Washington to get the soul-refreshing which comes through the\r\n     gathering together of kindred spirits from the entire nation.\r\n\r\n     As I shall be glad to see the women of the South, of all possible\r\n     aims and ends, meet in council, so I should rejoice to see them\r\n     hold a southern States' suffrage convention. I say this because I\r\n     want you to know that my heartiest sympathy goes with you in your\r\n     effort to call together the women of your section of the Union; and\r\n     I shall rejoice to see the women of the far-off northwestern States\r\n     doing the same thing. Women should have their local societies and\r\n     meetings, their county, State and section conventions, and then,\r\n     for our great national gathering, each State should send its\r\n     representatives to Washington, there to confer together and go\r\n     before the committees of Congress to urge our claims. What a power\r\n     women would be if all could but see eye to eye in their struggle\r\n     for freedom!\r\n\r\nShe remained at home long enough to prepare the memorials to the\r\nnational political conventions, and June 4 found her at Minneapolis\r\nready for the Republican gathering. She was entertained by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nT. B. Walker, and found Mrs. J. Ellen Foster also a guest in that\r\nhospitable home. The memorial presented by the National-American W. S.\r\nA. contained the same unanswerable arguments for the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen which had been made for so many years, and asked for the following\r\nplank: \"As a voice in the laws and the rulers under which we live is the\r\ninalienable right of every citizen of a republic, we pledge ourselves,\r\nwhen again in power, to place the ballot in the hand of every woman of\r\nlegal age, as the only weapon with which she can protect her person and\r\nproperty and defend herself against all aggressive legislation.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was notified that she could have a hearing before the\r\nplatform committee on the evening of June 8. She was promptly on hand\r\nand was kept standing in the hall outside of the committee room until\r\nafter 9 o'clock. Finally she was so tired she sent for one of the\r\ncommittee to ask how much longer she would have to wait. She learned\r\nthat its chairman, J. B. Foraker, of Ohio, refused to preside or call\r\nthe committee to order to hear any argument on woman suffrage. Senator\r\nJones, of Nevada, then hunted him up and asked if he might preside in\r\nhis place, and permission being given she was invited into the room. She\r\nspoke for thirty minutes as only a woman could speak who had suffered\r\nthe persecution of an Abolitionist before the Republican party was born,\r\nwho had been loyal to that party throughout all the dark days of the\r\nCivil War, who had not once repudiated its principles in all the years\r\nwhich had since elapsed. She pleaded that now she and the women she\r\nrepresented might have its support and recognition in their right to\r\nrepresentation at the ballot-box. This committee was composed of\r\ntwoscore of the most prominent men in the Republican party and, at the\r\nclose of Miss Anthony's address, every one in the room arose and many\r\ncrowded about her, giving her the most earnest assurance of their belief\r\nin the justice of her cause, but telling her frankly that they could not\r\nput a woman suffrage plank in their platform as the party was not able\r\nto carry the load! The plank eventually adopted read as follows:\r\n\r\n     We demand that every citizen of the United States shall be allowed\r\n     to cast one free and unrestricted ballot in all public elections,\r\n     and that such ballot shall be counted as cast; that such laws shall\r\n     be enacted and enforced as will secure to every citizen, be he rich\r\n     or poor, native or foreign, white or black, this sovereign right\r\n     guaranteed by the Constitution. The free and honest popular ballot,\r\n     the just and equal representation of all the people, as well as\r\n     their just and equal protection under the laws, are the foundation\r\n     of our republican institutions, and the party will never relax its\r\n     efforts until the integrity of the ballot and the purity of\r\n     elections shall be guaranteed and protected in every State.\r\n\r\nThis was identical with the one adopted in 1888, at which time a number\r\nof women had telegraphed the chairman asking if the convention intended\r\nit to apply to women, and he had answered that he did not understand it\r\nto have any such intention. Therefore the women who went to the\r\nRepublican convention of 1892 asking for bread, received instead \"the\r\nwater in which the eggs had been boiled.\"\r\n\r\nThere were present at this convention two regularly appointed women\r\ndelegates from Wyoming, and the difference in the attention bestowed\r\nupon them and upon those who came to press the claims of the great class\r\nof the disfranchised, ought to have been an object lesson to all who\r\nassert that women will lose the respect of men when they enter\r\npolitics. Not a newspaper in the country had a slur to cast on these\r\nwomen delegates. The Boston Globe made this pertinent comment: \"An\r\nelective queen in this country is no more out of place than one seated\r\nby hereditary consent abroad. It is no rash prediction to assert that\r\nthe child is now born who will see a woman in the presidential chair.\r\nThomas Jefferson will not be fully vindicated until this government\r\nrests upon the consent of all the governed.\"\r\n\r\nAfter just five days at home Miss Anthony left for Chicago to attend the\r\nDemocratic National Convention, June 21, which was requested to adopt\r\nthe following plank: \"Whether we view the suffrage as a privilege or as\r\na natural right, it belongs equally to every citizen of good character\r\nand legal age under government; hence women as well as men should enjoy\r\nthe dignity and protection of the ballot in their own hands.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony and Isabella Beecher Hooker took rooms at the Palmer House\r\nand the latter made arrangements for the hearing before the resolution\r\ncommittee, which was assembled in one of the parlors, Henry Watterson,\r\nof Louisville, chairman. The ladies made their speeches, were\r\ncourteously heard, politely bowed out, and the platform was as densely\r\nsilent on the question of woman suffrage as it had been during its whole\r\nhistory. Mrs. Hooker remained alone in the convention until 2 o'clock in\r\nthe morning, hoping to get a chance to address that body. She had not\r\nbeen fooled as many times as Miss Anthony, who returned to the hotel and\r\nwent to bed.\r\n\r\nThe Union Signal, Frances E. Willard, editor, spoke thus of the\r\noccasion:\r\n\r\n     That heroic figure, Susan B. Anthony, sure to stand out in history\r\n     as plainly as any of our presidents, has given added significance\r\n     to the two great political conventions of the year. Neither party\r\n     has recognized her plea, but both have innumerable adherents who\r\n     openly declare themselves in favor of her principles. She states\r\n     that this year she felt for the first time that she had a pivot on\r\n     which to hang her quadrennial plea, and that pivot was Wyoming, the\r\n     men of that equal-minded State in both conventions holding up her\r\n     hands. Miss Anthony's pathetic eyes reveal that she has attained to\r\n     loneliness--the guerdon of great spirits who struggle from any\r\n     direction toward the mountain tops of human liberty. But on the\r\n     heights such souls meet God, and one day all women shall call her\r\n     blessed.\r\n\r\nThe National Prohibition Convention at Cincinnati, June 30, was not\r\nvisited by Miss Anthony, as she felt that the women of this party needed\r\nno assistance in looking after the interests of suffrage. The third\r\nplank in the platform there adopted read: \"No citizen should be denied\r\nthe right to vote on account of sex.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Chicago she went directly to Kansas to look after the fences in\r\nthat State. Mrs. Johns and Anna Shaw joined her and they spoke before\r\nthe Chautauqua Assembly at Ottawa, June 27, going thence to Topeka, as\r\nMiss Anthony expressed it, \"to watch the State Republican Convention.\"\r\nThey received a hearty greeting and she was invited to address the\r\nconvention June 30. The Capital said: \"There were loud calls for Susan\r\nB. Anthony and as she advanced to the platform she was greeted with the\r\nmost cordial applause.\" In the evening a reception was given in the\r\nSenate chamber to the ladies in attendance at the convention. Miss\r\nAnthony, Mrs. Johns and Mrs. May Belleville Brown addressed the\r\nresolution committee. The platform was reported with a plank favoring\r\nthe submission to the voters of a woman suffrage amendment, which was\r\nenthusiastically adopted--455 to 267--in the largest Republican\r\nconvention ever held in Kansas.[74]\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony and Miss Shaw then hastened to Omaha for the first national\r\nconvention of the People's party July 4. They arrived about 9 P. M.,\r\nJuly 2, to find they were booked for speeches at the Unitarian church\r\nthat evening and the audience had been waiting since 7:30, so they\r\nrushed thither, hot, dusty and tired, and made their addresses. Sunday\r\nafternoon they went to a workingwomen's meeting in the exposition\r\nbuilding and heard Master Workman Powderly for the first time. At his\r\ninvitation Miss Anthony also spoke.\r\n\r\nThe People's party, from its inception, had recognized women as speakers\r\nand delegates and claimed to be the party of morality and reform, but\r\nafter a day at the convention Miss Anthony writes in her diary: \"They\r\nare quite as oblivious to the underlying principle of justice to women\r\nas either of the old parties and, as a convention, still more so.\" The\r\nresolution committee refused to grant the ladies even an opportunity to\r\naddress them, which had been done willingly by the Republicans and\r\nDemocrats. Their platform contained no reference to woman suffrage\r\nexcept that in the long preamble occurred the sentence: \"We believe that\r\nthe forces of reform this day organized will never cease to move forward\r\nuntil every wrong is righted, and equal rights and equal privileges\r\nsecurely established for all the men and women of this country.\" This\r\nsentiment, however, was universally accepted by the delegates as\r\nincluding the right of suffrage.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony spoke at the Beatrice Chautauqua Assembly, and then\r\nreturned to Rochester. She had some time before received a letter from\r\nChancellor John H. Vincent saying: \"The subject of woman suffrage will\r\nbe presented at Chautauqua on Saturday, July 30, 1892. A prominent\r\nspeaker will be secured to present the question as forcibly as possible.\r\nIn behalf of the Chautauqua management, I take pleasure in extending to\r\nyou a hearty invitation to be present and take a place upon the platform\r\non that occasion. Trusting that you will be able to accept this\r\ninvitation, I am, faithfully yours.\"\r\n\r\nShe had had a long, hot and fatiguing trip and her cool, spacious home\r\nwas so restful that she decided to defer her visit to Chautauqua until\r\nlater in the season.[75] On August 8, Miss Shaw, Mrs. Foster Avery and\r\nMiss Anthony, who had been having a little visit together, started from\r\nRochester for Chautauqua, where the Reverend Anna was to debate the\r\nquestion of woman suffrage with Rev. J. M. Buckley, editor New York\r\nChristian Advocate. She gave her address amidst a succession of cheers\r\nand applause, Miss Anthony sitting on the platform with her, an honor\r\nrarely accorded at the assembly. In the evening a delightful reception\r\nwas given to the three ladies in the Hall of Philosophy. Dr. Buckley\r\nmade his reply the next day to an audience so cold that even his supreme\r\nself-satisfaction was disturbed. If any one thing ever has been\r\ndemonstrated at Chautauqua, by those speeches and all preceding and\r\nfollowing them on the same question, it is that the sentiment of the\r\nvast majority of the people who annually visit this great assembly is in\r\nfavor of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking at the Cassadaga Lake camp meeting, August 24, Miss\r\nAnthony went in September to the Mississippi Valley Conference at Des\r\nMoines. It was thought that possibly by holding a great convention in\r\nthe West, large numbers in that section of the country and the States\r\nalong the Mississippi could attend who would find it inconvenient to go\r\nto Washington. She was glad to give her co-operation and spoke and\r\nworked valiantly through all the sessions. From Des Moines she went to\r\nPeru, Neb., at the urgent invitation of President George L. Farnham, to\r\naddress the State Normal School.[76]\r\n\r\nEarly in October she began her tour of the State of Kansas under the\r\nauspices of the Republican central committee. She was accompanied one\r\nweek by Mrs. Johns, and then each went with some of the men who were\r\ncanvassing the State. Mrs. Johns made Republican speeches; Miss Anthony\r\ndescribed the record of the party on human freedom and urged them to\r\ncomplete that roll of honor by enfranchising women. The campaign\r\nmanagers were very much dissatisfied because she talked suffrage instead\r\nof tariff and finance, but as she was paying her own travelling expenses\r\nand contributing her services, she reserved the right to speak on the\r\nonly subject in which she felt a vital interest. If the Republicans had\r\nwon the election, Miss Anthony and Mrs. Johns expected that of course\r\nthey would take up the question of woman suffrage and carry it to\r\nsuccess; but the State was carried by the newly formed People's party.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was thoroughly rested and renovated in her own home,\r\nafter this hard campaign, Miss Anthony left for the State convention at\r\nSyracuse, November 14.[77] The Standard, intending to compliment the\r\nladies, said: \"The loud-voiced, aggressive woman of other days was not\r\nhere. In her place were low-voiced, quietly-dressed, womanly women, and\r\nthose who expected to see the 'woman rioter' of the past failed to find\r\none of the sort. The graceful, dignified and quiet woman of today bears\r\nno likeness to some who have gone before, who thought to break through\r\nand gain their desires.\"\r\n\r\nA contemporary called the paper down as follows: \"When it is remembered\r\nthat Susan B. Anthony was one of the originators of the movement, that\r\nLucy Stone and Mrs. Greenleaf and a host of others who have marched\r\nright along in the suffrage ranks from the beginning, were also the\r\nleaders in this 'low-voiced' assembly who came on tip-toe and acted in\r\npantomime, the compliment, to say the least, has negative qualities.\" An\r\ninterview on this statement contains the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n     \"It simply shows,\" said Miss Anthony, smiling, \"how differently the\r\n     question is regarded now. Among the women who were pioneers in the\r\n     movement were Elizabeth Cady Stanton and myself. I don't think it\r\n     probable that we are any sweeter-faced or that our voices are any\r\n     more melodious than they were thirty years ago. It is only that the\r\n     whole matter was regarded with such horror and aversion then that\r\n     any one connected with it was looked upon in a disagreeable light;\r\n     it is very different now.\" Her pleasant face, with a suggestion of\r\n     her Quaker descent in its soft bands of gray hair, took on a gently\r\n     reminiscent expression, which her visitor could not help but\r\n     contrast amusedly with the imaginary portrait of the redoubtable\r\n     Amazon that in her early years was conjured up by the sound of\r\n     Susan B. Anthony's name.\r\n\r\nThanksgiving Day she attended service at the Universalist church and\r\ncomments in her diary: \"Mr. Morrill, the associate pastor, spoke on\r\n'The undiscovered Church without a Bishop;' Mr. Gannett, 'The\r\nundiscovered State without a King;' Mr. Lansberg, 'Many States in One;'\r\nall good, but all alike gave not the faintest hint of any undiscovered\r\nAmerica, where the male head of the family should not be considered\r\n'divinely appointed.' I had hard work to keep my peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day she went to Buffalo to address the alumnæ of the ladies'\r\nacademy, and was entertained by Miss Charlotte Mulligan, founder of the\r\nmissionary school for boys. During this time she was investigating the\r\nnew law permitting women to vote for county school commissioners in New\r\nYork, and found to her disgust that by the use of the words \"county\r\nclerk\" instead merely of \"clerk who prints and distributes the ballots,\"\r\nall the women of the large towns and cities were still disfranchised;\r\njust as the law of 1880 had used the words \"school meeting,\" which also\r\ncut off the women of the cities. This was another illustration of the\r\nmanner in which every step of the way to suffrage for women has been\r\nmade as difficult as possible.\r\n\r\nIn December Miss Anthony became an office-holder! It happened in this\r\nway: Her neighbor, Dr. Jonas Jones, who had been one of the trustees of\r\nthe State Industrial School located at Rochester, died on the 4th. She\r\nimmediately wrote to Governor Roswell P. Flower requesting that a woman\r\nbe put on the board in his place, in addition to the one already serving\r\n(Mrs. Emil Kuichling), and suggested Mrs. Lansberg, wife of the rabbi;\r\nat the same time she asked Mary Seymour Howell, who resided in Albany,\r\nto see the governor and use her influence. She did so and found he was\r\nquite willing to appoint a woman but would not consider any but Miss\r\nAnthony. She, however, was away from home so much she thought that in\r\njustice to the institution she ought not take the position; but when she\r\nlearned that her refusal might result in a man's being given the place,\r\nshe telegraphed her willingness to accept. She was appointed at once to\r\nfill out the unexpired term of Dr. Jones, and May 4, 1893, was\r\nre-appointed by Governor Levi P. Morton for a full term. Of course\r\nnumerous letters and telegrams of congratulation were received and the\r\nnewspapers contained many kind notices, similar in tone to this from the\r\nDemocrat and Chronicle:\r\n\r\n     It is a good appointment; a fitting recognition of one of the\r\n     ablest and best women in the commonwealth. There has been a vast\r\n     amount of cheap wit expended upon Miss Anthony during the past\r\n     years, and although it has been almost entirely good-natured it has\r\n     served to give a wrong impression to the unthinking of one of the\r\n     clearest-headed and most unselfish women ever identified with a\r\n     public movement.... Speaking of her appointment she said: \"You see\r\n     I have been regarded as a hoofed and horned creature for so long\r\n     that even a little thing touches my heart, and when it comes to\r\n     being recognized as an American citizen after fighting forty years\r\n     to prove my citizenship, it begins to look as if we women have not\r\n     fought in vain.\" ... A braver-hearted woman than Susan B. Anthony\r\n     never lived, but those who can read between the lines of her remark\r\n     will not miss the little touch of pathos in her pride, and the hint\r\n     of the disappointments which have hurt in the long struggle.\r\n\r\nA new charter for the city of Rochester had been prepared and a mass\r\nmeeting of citizens was announced for December 12, to hear an exposition\r\nof its points. The morning paper said: \"By far the most largely attended\r\nmeeting the Chamber of Commerce has ever held was that of last evening.\r\nThe large attendance was due to the announcement that the new charter\r\nwould be discussed by Miss Susan B. Anthony, and the interest of the\r\nmeeting was largely due to the fact that, true to her colors, she kept\r\nher engagement....\" Miss Anthony's commission had been received from the\r\ngovernor that day, which fact was announced by President Brickner as he\r\nintroduced her, and she was greeted with cheers. In the course of her\r\nspeech she said:\r\n\r\n     Since promising to address this body, I have tried in vain to find\r\n     some word which would settle the question with every member present\r\n     in favor of so amending the charter as to give our women equal\r\n     voice in conducting the affairs of the city. It seems such a\r\n     self-evident thing that the mother's opinion should be weighed and\r\n     measured in the political scales as well as that of her son. It is\r\n     so simple and just that the wife's judgment should be respected and\r\n     counted as well as the husband's. And who can give the reason why\r\n     the sister's opinion should be ignored and the brother's\r\n     honored?... Over 5,000 women of this city pay taxes on real estate,\r\n     and who shall say they are not as much interested in every\r\n     question of financial expenditure as any 5,000 men; in the public\r\n     parks, street railways, grade crossings, pavements, bridges, etc.?\r\n     And not only the 5,000 tax-paying women, but all the women of the\r\n     city are equally interested in the sanitary condition of our\r\n     streets, alleys, schools, police stations, jails and asylums....\r\n\r\n     To repair the damages of society seems to be the mission assigned\r\n     to women, and we ask that the necessary implements shall be placed\r\n     in their hands. But, you say, women can be appointed to see to\r\n     these matters without voting. Yes, but they are not; and if they\r\n     were, without the ballot they would be powerless to effect the\r\n     improvements they might find necessary. If the women of this city\r\n     had the right to vote, those on the board of charities, for\r\n     instance, would not be compelled year after year to beg each member\r\n     of every new council for the appointment of some women as city\r\n     physicians, as scores of them have done for the past six or eight\r\n     years. Had we the right to vote, do you suppose we should have to\r\n     plead in vain before the two parties to place women in nomination\r\n     for the school board?\r\n\r\n     I want this amendment of the charter first, because it is right and\r\n     just to women; second, that women may have a political fulcrum on\r\n     which to plant their lever for everything they wish to secure\r\n     through government; third, that the opinions of the women of this\r\n     city may be respected, and there is no other way to secure respect\r\n     but to have them counted with those of men in the ballot-box on\r\n     every possible question which is carried to that tribunal; and\r\n     fourth, to free the mothers from the cruel taunt of being\r\n     responsible for the character of their grown-up sons while denied\r\n     all power to control the conditions surrounding them after they\r\n     pass beyond the dooryards of their homes.\r\n\r\nShe continued by showing the good effects of woman's municipal suffrage\r\nin England, Canada and also in Kansas, and full suffrage in Wyoming; and\r\nclosed with an earnest appeal for an amendment to the new charter which\r\nshould confer the municipal franchise upon women. A few days later the\r\nboard of trustees took final action on the charter, of which the\r\nDemocrat and Chronicle said: \"The amendment proposed by Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony extending the suffrage to women was defeated, although by a\r\nclose vote. Had there been a full meeting of the board it is a question\r\nwhether it would not have been adopted, as several of the members who\r\nwere not present last evening had expressed themselves as\r\nfavorable.\"[78]\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony addressed the Monroe County Teachers' Institute at\r\nBrighton, December 16. The diary records many visits to the Industrial\r\nSchool, conferences with the other fourteen trustees and much\r\ncorrespondence with the boards of similar institutions elsewhere. In her\r\nmail this year were letters from most of the civilized countries on the\r\nglobe, among them several from the leaders of the movement in New\r\nZealand, saying that her name was more familiar than all others there,\r\nand asking for advice and encouragement in their work of securing the\r\nballot for women.[79] The following was received from Mrs. Kate Beckwith\r\nLee, Dowagiac, Mich.: \"Mr. Bonet, our sculptor, obtained your\r\nphotograph, and we now have your grand face looking down in stone from\r\nthe front of our theater, which was erected as an educator to our people\r\nand a memorial to my father, P. D. Beckwith, who was liberal toward all\r\nmankind and a believer in woman's equality, and I sincerely hope you may\r\nsome time see the building.\" The other women sculptured on this handsome\r\nedifice are George Eliot, George Sand, Rachel, Mary Anderson and Sarah\r\nBernhardt. Among the great mass of correspondence, this is selected:\r\n\r\n     An incident which is of no particular consequence to this inquiry,\r\n     constrains me to write in the hope that you may find time to place\r\n     upon paper your recollection of the connection that my father (the\r\n     late George H. Thacher, then mayor of the city of Albany) had with\r\n     your anti-slavery meeting in this city just before the war. I was\r\n     too young to have it make a vivid impression upon me, but it has\r\n     sometimes been said that was the first opportunity your\r\n     organization had to freely express its views within the State of\r\n     New York. I will be very grateful if you will permit your memory to\r\n     go back some thirty years and recall that incident.[80] Yours,\r\n\r\n                                             JOHN BOYD THACHER.\r\n\r\nThis illustrates the pride which the children of the future will have in\r\nshowing that their parents or grandparents rendered some assistance to\r\nthe cause of woman and of freedom. Yet Mr. Thacher, who, as a member of\r\nthe New York Board of General Managers of the Columbian Exposition, had\r\nthe selection of those who should compose the Woman's Board of the\r\nState, did not name one who had been identified with the great movement\r\nfor equal rights during the past forty years, and had made it possible\r\nfor women to participate in this celebration.\r\n\r\nA case which had been commenced in the courts of New York in 1891 and\r\nhad run along through several years, may as well be described here as\r\nelsewhere. Miss Anthony had but an indirect connection with it and it is\r\nmentioned more for its utter ridiculousness than for any other reason. A\r\nwoman's art association in New York City, Mrs. Elizabeth Thompson,\r\npresident, Miss Alice Donlevy, secretary, had the promise of a legacy to\r\nbuild an academy, and they decided to place a statue or bust at each\r\nside of the entrance, representing Reform and Philanthropy. Miss Anthony\r\nwas selected for the one and Mrs. Mary Hamilton Schuyler for the other.\r\nThe latter, in 1852, founded the New York School of Design for Women,\r\nhad been the friend and patron of art, and for many years before her\r\ndeath had been noted for her philanthropic work.\r\n\r\nA serious difficulty at once arose in the opposition of Mrs. Schuyler's\r\nnephew and stepson, Philip Schuyler, who objected to the \"disagreeable\r\nnotoriety.\" He carried the matter into the courts, which of course\r\nattracted the comment of all the newspapers of the country, pro and con,\r\nand caused more \"disagreeable notoriety\" than a dozen statues would have\r\ndone. He obtained a preliminary injunction against the art association\r\nand then took the case to the supreme court for a permanent injunction,\r\non the ground that the \"right of privacy\" had been violated. The real\r\nsecret of his objections, however, was exposed in his complaint before\r\nthe supreme court. Among the twenty-eight grievances alleged were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     Twenty-second.--The said Mary M. Hamilton Schuyler took no part\r\n     whatever in any of the various so-called woman's rights agitations,\r\n     with which the aforesaid Susan B. Anthony was, and is, prominently\r\n     identified; and that she took no interest in such agitations or\r\n     movements, and had no sympathy whatever with them; and that, as\r\n     the plaintiff believes, she would have resented any attempt such as\r\n     is made by the defendants to couple her name with that of the said\r\n     Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\n     Twenty-third.--The acts of the defendants in attempting to raise\r\n     money by public subscription for a statue of the said Mary M.\r\n     Hamilton Schuyler; in associating her name with the name of Susan\r\n     B. Anthony, and in announcing that the projected statue of her is\r\n     to be placed on public exhibition at the Columbian Exposition as a\r\n     companion piece to a statue of the said Susan B. Anthony,\r\n     constitute, and are an unlawful interference with the right of\r\n     privacy, and a gross and unwarranted outrage upon the memory of the\r\n     said Mary M. Hamilton Schuyler, under the specious pretense of\r\n     doing honor to her memory; and that the surviving members of her\r\n     family have been, and are, greatly distressed and injured thereby.\r\n\r\nThe supreme court continued the injunction, and the art association then\r\ncarried the case up to the court of appeals. Here the decision of the\r\nlower court was reversed. The opinion was rendered by Justice Rufus W.\r\nPeckham, afterwards appointed by President Cleveland to the Supreme\r\nBench of the United States. It is not often that a judge of the highest\r\ncourt in the State incorporates in a legal decision a compliment to a\r\nwoman, and for this reason the tribute of Justice Peckham is the more\r\nhighly appreciated. After holding that \"persons attempting to erect a\r\nstatue or bust of a woman no longer living, if their motive is to do\r\nhonor to her, and if the work is to be done in an appropriate manner,\r\ncan not be restrained by her surviving relatives,\" he continued:\r\n\r\n     Many may, and probably do, totally disagree with the advanced views\r\n     of Miss Anthony in regard to the proper sphere of women, and yet it\r\n     is impossible to deny to her the possession of many of the\r\n     ennobling qualities which tend to the making of great lives. She\r\n     has given the most unselfish devotion of a long life to what she\r\n     has considered would tend most for the benefit and practical\r\n     improvement of her sex, and she has thus lived almost literally in\r\n     the face of the whole world, and during that period there has never\r\n     been a single shadow of any dark or ugly fact connected with her or\r\n     her way of life to dim the lustre of her achievements and of her\r\n     efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] In the center of the Anthony lot, not far from the main gateway, is\r\na square monument of Medina granite, the four sides of its cap-stone\r\ninscribed Liberty, Justice, Fraternity, Equality.\r\n\r\n[74] At the convention of Republican clubs a few days previous, Senator\r\nIngalls, having been defeated for re-election to the Senate and feeling\r\nsomewhat humbled, said in his speech: \"I believe every man ought to be a\r\npolitician; I might say every woman also. If a plank endorsing woman\r\nsuffrage were inserted in the Republican platform, I would stand upon\r\nit.\" Ten years before, in this same city, he had declared it to be \"that\r\nobscene dogma, whose advocates are long-haired men and short-haired\r\nwomen, the unsexed of both sexes, human capons and epicenes.\"\r\n\r\n[75] Henry B. Blackwell delivered the address at Chautauqua. At its\r\nclose he asked all who were opposed to woman suffrage to rise, and about\r\ntwenty persons stood up. He then asked all who were in favor to stand,\r\nand the great audience, filling the huge amphitheater, rose in a body.\r\n\r\n[76] When she spoke in the New York State Teachers' Convention in 1853,\r\nthe first time a woman's voice had been heard in that body, Professor\r\nFarnham, then superintendent of the Syracuse public schools, was one of\r\nthe three men who came up and congratulated her.\r\n\r\n[77] While here Miss Anthony received a telegram: \"Greeting, gratitude\r\nand good-by to the noblest Roman of them all and her brave host, from\r\nIsabel Somerset and Frances E. Willard.\" They had expected to stop in\r\nRochester and visit her before leaving for England, but had gone to New\r\nYork by another route.\r\n\r\n[78] Jean Brooks Greenleaf, at this time in Washington with her husband,\r\nwrote Miss Anthony:\r\n\r\n\"I felt heart-sick when I learned the result of the charter business and\r\nI am not over it yet. I told Mr. Greenleaf I would dispose of every bit\r\nof taxable property I have in Rochester. I can not bear to think that,\r\nwith so glorious an opportunity to be just, men prefer to be so unjust.\r\nThey can help it if they will, those men who speak us so fair. If they\r\nwould make one solid stand for our rights they could overrule the masses\r\nwho are not half so unready to do women justice as they are represented.\r\nGood God! when I think of it I wonder how you have borne it all these\r\nyears and not gone wild.\"\r\n\r\n[79] Full suffrage was granted to the women of New Zealand in 1893.\r\n\r\n[80] In February, 1861; see Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nWORLD'S FAIR--CONGRESS OF REPRESENTATIVE WOMEN.\r\n\r\n1893.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Miss Anthony writes in her journal at the\r\nbeginning of the New Year, 1893: \"The clouds do not lift from my spirit.\r\nI am simply overwhelmed with the feeling that I can not make my way\r\nthrough the work before me.\" Never a year in all her crowded life opened\r\nwith such a mountain of things to be attended to--suffrage conventions,\r\ncouncil meetings, the great Woman's Congress at the World's Fair, State\r\ncampaigns, Industrial School matters, lecture engagements--the list\r\nseemed to stretch out into infinity, and it is no wonder that it\r\nappalled even her dauntless spirit.\r\n\r\nThe first necessity was to get the Washington annual convention out of\r\nthe way. It had been set for an early date this winter, and she left\r\nhome January 5. Headquarters were at Willard's Hotel and the convention\r\nopened in Metzerott's Music Hall, January 15, continuing the usual five\r\ndays. At the opening session Miss Anthony read beautiful tributes by\r\nMrs. Stanton to George William Curtis, John Greenleaf Whittier,\r\nErnestine L. Rose and Abby Hutchinson Patton, who had died during the\r\nyear, all earnest and consistent friends of woman's equality.\r\nResolutions were adopted recognizing the splendid services of Francis\r\nMinor, Benjamin F. Butler, Abby Hopper Gibbons, Rev. Anna Oliver and a\r\nnumber of other active and efficient workers who also had passed away.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony, in her president's address, gave a strong, cheery account\r\nof the past year's work and an encouraging view of the future, and at\r\nboth day and evening sessions there were the usual number of able and\r\nentertaining speeches. Reports were made by delegates from thirty-six\r\nStates. At the business meeting the question again came up of holding\r\nthe annual convention in Washington at the beginning of each new\r\nCongress and in some other part of the country in alternate years. This\r\nplan was vigorously opposed by Miss Anthony, who said in her protest:\r\n\r\n     The sole object, it seems to me, of this national organization is\r\n     to bring the combined influence of all the States upon Congress to\r\n     secure national legislation. The very moment you change the purpose\r\n     of this great body from National to State work you have defeated\r\n     its object. It is the business of the States to do the district\r\n     work; to create public sentiment; to make a national organization\r\n     possible, and then to bring their united power to the capital and\r\n     focus it on Congress. Our younger women naturally can not\r\n     appreciate the vast amount of work done here in Washington by the\r\n     National Association in the last twenty-five years. The delegates\r\n     do not come here as individuals but as representatives of their\r\n     entire States. We have had these national conventions here for a\r\n     quarter of a century, and every Congress has given hearings to the\r\n     ablest women we could bring from every section. In the olden times\r\n     the States were not fully organized--they had not money enough to\r\n     pay their delegates' expenses. We begged and worked and saved the\r\n     money, and the National Association paid the expenses of delegates\r\n     from Oregon and California in order that they might come and bring\r\n     the influence of their States to bear upon Congress.\r\n\r\n     Last winter we had twenty-three States represented by delegates.\r\n     Think of those twenty-three women going before the Senate\r\n     committee, each making her speech, and convincing those senators of\r\n     the interest in all these States. We have educated at least a part\r\n     of three or four hundred men and their wives and daughters every\r\n     two years to return as missionaries to their respective localities.\r\n     I shall feel it a grave mistake if you vote in favor of a movable\r\n     convention. It will lessen our influence and our power; but come\r\n     what may, I shall abide by the decision of the majority.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was warmly supported by a number of delegates but the final\r\nvote resulted: in favor, 37; opposed, 28.\r\n\r\nAmong the notable letters received by the convention was the following\r\nfrom Lucy Stone: \"Wherever woman suffragists are gathered together in\r\nthe name of equal rights, there am I always in spirit with them.\r\nAlthough absent, my personal glad greeting goes to every one; to those\r\nwho have borne the heat and burden of the day, and to the strong, brave,\r\nyounger workers who have come to lighten the load and complete the\r\nvictory. We may surely rejoice now when there are so many gains won and\r\nconceded, and when favorable indications are on every hand. The way\r\nbefore us is shorter than that behind; but the work still calls for\r\npatient perseverance and ceaseless endeavor. The end is not yet in\r\nsight, but it can not be far away.\" Those who listened little thought\r\nthat this would be the last message ever received from that earnest\r\nworker of fifty long years. Letters of greeting were sent to her and to\r\nMrs. Stanton. Miss Anthony was unanimously re-elected president.\r\n\r\nShe lingered for a few days' visit with Mrs. Greenleaf, who gave a\r\nreception for her, at which Grace Greenwood was one of the receiving\r\nparty. She had a luncheon at Mrs. Waite's, wife of the Chief-Justice,\r\nand after several other pleasant social functions, left Washington\r\nFebruary 1.[81] There was now a magnet in New York City and henceforth\r\nshe always arranged her hurried eastern trips so that she might spend a\r\nfew hours or days with Mrs. Stanton, when as in the old time, they wrote\r\ncalls, resolutions and memorials and made plans to storm the\r\nstrongholds.\r\n\r\nOn February 8, Miss Anthony spoke at Warsaw, the guest of Mrs. Maud\r\nHumphrey; and for the next week the journal says: \"Trying all these days\r\nto get to the bottom of my piles of accumulated letters.\" On her\r\nseventy-third birthday the Political Equality Club gave a reception at\r\nthe pleasant home of Rev. and Mrs. W. C. Gannett, and presented her with\r\na handsome silver teapot, spirit lamp and tray. Mrs. George Hollister\r\ngave her a set of point lace which had belonged to her mother, the\r\ndaughter of Thurlow Weed; and there were numerous other gifts. She wrote\r\nto Mrs. Avery on the 23d: \"It is just ten years ago this morning, dear\r\nRachel, since we two went gypsying into the old world. Well, it was a\r\nhappy acquaintance we made then and it has been a blessed decade which\r\nhas intervened. Ten years of constant work and thought, but ten years\r\nnearer the golden day of jubilee!\"\r\n\r\nShe arranged a meeting at the Rochester Chamber of Commerce, March 1,\r\nfor May Wright Sewall, president National Council of Women, to speak on\r\nthe approaching Woman's Congress at the World's Fair. On March 6 she\r\nbegan a brief lecture tour, speaking in Hillsdale, Detroit, Saginaw, Bay\r\nCity, Grand Rapids, Lansing, Battle Creek, Charlotte and in Toledo. Nine\r\nevening addresses, several receptions, and over a thousand miles of\r\ntravel in twelve days, was not a bad record for a woman past\r\nseventy-three.[82]\r\n\r\nAmong the pleasant letters received through the winter were several from\r\nthe South. Miss Anthony was especially appreciative of the friendship of\r\nsouthern women, as her part in the \"abolition\" movement in early times\r\nhad created a prejudice against her, and in later days the sentiment for\r\nsuffrage had not been sufficient to call her into that part of the\r\ncountry, where she might form personal acquaintances and friendships.\r\nShe had, during these months, earnest letters from the women of Italy\r\nasking for encouragement and co-operation in their struggles. Many\r\nletters came also from teachers, stenographers and other wage-earning\r\nwomen, full of grateful acknowledgment of their indebtedness to her.\r\nThere were invitations enough for lectures to fill every month in the\r\nyear, ranging from the Christian Association at Cornell to the\r\nFree-thinkers' Club in New York, and covering all the grades of belief\r\nor non-belief between the two. She was asked to contribute to a\r\nsymposium on \"The Ideal Man,\" to write an account of \"The Underground\r\nRailroad,\" and to give so many written opinions on current topics of\r\ndiscussion that to have complied would have kept her at her desk from\r\nearly morning until the midnight hour.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to a friend she said: \"The other day a millionaire who wrote\r\nme, 'wondered why I didn't have my letters typewritten.' Why, bless him,\r\nI never, in all my fifty years of hard work with the pen, had a writing\r\ndesk with pigeonholes and drawers until my seventieth birthday brought\r\nme the present of one, and never had I even a dream of money enough for\r\na stenographer and typewriter. How little those who have realize the\r\nlimitations of those who have not.\"\r\n\r\nShe wrote to Robert Purvis at this time: \"What a magnificent opening\r\nspeech Gladstone made, and how splendid his final remarks: 'It would be\r\nmisery for me if I had foregone or omitted in these closing years of my\r\nlife any measure it was possible for me to take towards upholding and\r\npromoting the cause--not of one party or one nation, but of all parties\r\nand all nations.' So can you and I say with Gladstone, we should be\r\nmiserable but for the consciousness that we have done all in our power\r\nto help forward every measure for the freedom and equality of the races\r\nand the sexes.\"\r\n\r\nIn April she lectured at a number of places in New York to add to the\r\nlimited fund which kept the pot boiling at home.[83] She also went to\r\nBuffalo to talk over Industrial School matters with Mrs. Harriet A.\r\nTownsend, president of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union,\r\nwhich had proved so great a success in that city. On the 28th she spoke\r\nbefore the Woman's Columbian Exposition Committee of Cincinnati, \"to a\r\nvery fashionable and representative audience,\" the Enquirer said. For\r\nthis lecture she received $125. During the spring she wrote the Woman's\r\nTribune:\r\n\r\n     How splendidly Kansas women voted, and now come suffrage amendments\r\n     in Colorado, New York and Kansas! Well, we must buckle on our armor\r\n     for a triple fight, and we must shout more loudly than ever to our\r\n     friends all over the country for money to help these States.\r\n     Although Kansas is the most certain to carry the question,\r\n     nevertheless we must organize every school district of every county\r\n     of each State in which the battle of the ballot for woman is to be\r\n     fought. _Organize_, _agitate_, _educate_, must be our war cry from\r\n     this to the day of the election.\r\n\r\n     Today's mail brought $100 to our national treasury from Mrs. P. A.\r\n     Moffett, of Fredonia. How my heart leaped for joy as I read her\r\n     letter and again and again looked at her check, and how I\r\n     ejaculated over and over, \"O that a thousand of our good women who\r\n     _wish_ success to our cause would be moved thus to send in their\r\n     checks!\" Only a very few can go outside to work, but many can\r\n     contribute money to help pay the expenses of those who do leave all\r\n     their home-friends, comforts and luxuries. If the many who stay at\r\n     home and wish, could only believe for a moment that we who go out\r\n     not knowing where our heads will rest when night comes, really love\r\n     our homes as they love theirs, they would vie with each other to\r\n     throw in their mite to make the path smooth for the wayfarers. But\r\n     we, every one of us who can speak acceptably, must do all in our\r\n     power to persuade the men of these States to vote for the\r\n     amendment. Do let us all take to ourselves new hope and courage for\r\n     the herculean task before us. Who will send the next $100? O, that\r\n     we had $10,000 to start with!\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony and Mrs. Avery met at Mrs. Sewall's for a conference on\r\nWoman's Congress matters and then went to Chicago to attend, by\r\ninvitation, the formal opening of the Columbian Exposition May 1, 1893.\r\nMiss Anthony wrote: \"Mrs. Palmer's speech was very fine, covering full\r\nequality for woman.\" Her address the year before at the dedication\r\nceremonies contained one of the noblest tributes ever paid to women,\r\nclosing with these beautiful sentences: \"Even more important than the\r\ndiscovery of Columbus, which we are gathered together to celebrate, is\r\nthe fact that the general government has just discovered woman. It has\r\nsent out a flashlight from its heights, so inaccessible to us, which we\r\nshall answer by a return signal when the exposition is opened. What will\r\nbe its next message to us?\" Upon this occasion she was even more\r\neloquent. Her keen expose of the absurd platitudes in regard to woman's\r\nsphere, and her fine defence of women in the industrial world, deserve a\r\nplace among the classics.\r\n\r\nSince Miss Anthony's part in this great world's exposition must\r\nnecessarily be condensed into small space, it seems most satisfactory to\r\nplace it all together. It has been related in the chapter of 1876 how\r\nwomen were denied practically all governmental recognition in the\r\nCentennial. They were determined that this should not be the case in\r\n1893. As early as 1889 she began making plans to this effect and\r\nconferring with other prominent women. Several officials, who were in\r\npositions to influence action on this question, had declared that\r\n\"those suffrage women should have nothing to do with the World's Fair;\"\r\nand as some women whose social prestige might be needed were likely to\r\nbe frightened off if suffrage were in any way connected with the matter,\r\nMiss Anthony felt the necessity of moving very discreetly. As \"those\r\nsuffrage women\" had been behind every progressive movement that ever had\r\nbeen made in the United States for their own sex, it was hardly possible\r\nthat they would not be the moving force in this. Miss Anthony was not\r\nseeking for laurels, however, either for herself or for her cause, but\r\nonly to carry her point--that women should participate in this great\r\nnational celebration and that they should do this with the sanction and\r\nassistance of the national government. In her plans she had the valuable\r\nbacking of Mrs. Spofford, who made it possible for her to remain in\r\nWashington every winter, gave the use of the Riggs House parlors for\r\nmeetings and aided in many other ways.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony went quietly about among the ladies in official life whom\r\nshe could trust, and as a result various World's Fair meetings were held\r\nat the hotel, participated in by Washington's influential women, and a\r\ncommittee appointed to wait upon Congress and ask that women be placed\r\non the commission. She did not appear at these gatherings, and only her\r\nfew confidantes knew that she was behind them. Meanwhile it was\r\nannounced early in January, 1890, that the World's Fair Bill had been\r\nbrought before the House, and Miss Anthony at once prepared a petition\r\nasking for the appointment of women on the National Board of Management.\r\nThis was placed in the hands of ladies of influence and in a few days\r\none hundred and eleven names were obtained of the wives and daughters of\r\nthe judges of the Supreme Court, the Cabinet, senators, representatives,\r\narmy officials; as distinguished a list as could be secured in the\r\nnational capital.\r\n\r\nThis petition was presented to the Senate January 12. It requested that\r\nwomen should be placed on the board with men, but instead, the bill was\r\npassed in March creating a commission of men and authorizing them to\r\nappoint a number of women to constitute a \"Board of Lady Managers.\"\r\nThese 115 appointments were intended to be practically of a\r\ncomplimentary nature, it was not expected that the women would take any\r\nprominent part, and no particular rule was observed in their selection.\r\nWhile perhaps in some States they were not the ablest who might have\r\nbeen found, they were, as a board, fairly representative. To bring this\r\ngreat body into harmonious action and guide it along important lines of\r\nwork, required a leader possessed of a combination of qualities rarely\r\nexisting in one person--not only the highest degree of executive ability\r\nbut self-control, tact and the power of managing men and women. They\r\nwere found, however, in the woman elected to preside over this board,\r\nMrs. Bertha Honoré Palmer, of Chicago. At the close of the exposition it\r\nwas universally conceded that she had proved herself pre-eminently the\r\none woman in all the country for this place. Her record, during the\r\nseveral years that she held this very responsible position, is one of\r\nthe most remarkable ever made by any woman.\r\n\r\nAt the time Miss Anthony prepared her petition to Congress for\r\nrepresentation, no action had been taken by any organized body of women\r\nin the country, and if she had not been on the field of battle in\r\nWashington and acted at the very moment she did, the bill would have\r\npassed Congress without any provision for women. They would have had no\r\nrecognition from the government, no appropriations for their work, no\r\nofficial power, and their splendid achievements at the Columbian\r\nExposition, which did more to advance the cause of women than all that\r\nhad been accomplished during the century, would have been lost to the\r\nworld. Having secured this great object, she asked no office for herself\r\nor for any other woman. On several public occasions, in the early months\r\nof the fair, she refused to speak or to sit on the platform, lest she\r\nmight embarrass the President of the Board of Lady Managers by\r\ncommitting her to woman suffrage. Mrs. Palmer, however, showed her the\r\nmost distinguished courtesy, in both public and private affairs,\r\ninviting her to the platform and including her in the social functions\r\nat her own residence. Miss Anthony soon felt that she was in full\r\nsympathy with herself in every measure which tended to secure for women\r\nabsolute equality of rights, a point which Mrs. Palmer emphasized in the\r\nmost unmistakable language in her eloquent address delivered in the\r\nWoman's Building, at the close of the exposition.\r\n\r\nIn these circumscribed limits it will be impossible to give any adequate\r\naccount of that greatest of all accomplishments of women at the World's\r\nFair--the Woman's Congress--whose proceedings fill two large volumes in\r\nthe official report. In order that intellectual as well as material\r\nprogress should be presented, it had been decided to hold a series of\r\ncongresses which should bring together a representation of the great\r\nminds of the world. C. C. Bonney was made president of the Congress\r\nAuxiliary; Mrs. Palmer, president, and Mrs. Ellen M. Henrotin,\r\nvice-president of the Woman's Branch. Although women were to participate\r\nin all, Mr. Bonney desired to have one composed of them alone. To assist\r\nMrs. Henrotin, who had been made acting president, as well as to further\r\ninsure the success of this congress, Mr. Bonney appointed May Wright\r\nSewall chairman, and Rachel Foster Avery secretary, of the committee of\r\norganization, and they were assisted by an efficient local committee.\r\n\r\nAs president and secretary of the National Council of Women, and Mrs.\r\nSewall vice-president of the International Council, no two could have\r\nbeen secured with so wide a knowledge of the organizations of women\r\nthroughout the world and the best methods of securing their\r\nco-operation. The magnitude of their labors can be appreciated only by\r\nan examination of the official report. The fact of their merging into\r\nthis congress the International Council of Women, which was to have been\r\nheld in London that year, was one of the most potent elements of its\r\nsuccess. Miss Anthony wrote Mrs. Sewall: \"The suffrage work has missed\r\nyou, oh, so much, still I would not have had you do differently. I glory\r\nin Rachel's and your work this year beyond words.\"\r\n\r\nThe World's Congress of Representative Women, which opened May 15,\r\n1893, was the largest and most brilliant of any of the series which\r\nextended through the six months of the fair, and was considered by many\r\nthe most remarkable ever convened. Twenty-seven countries and 126\r\norganizations were represented by 528 delegates. During the week\r\neighty-one meetings were held in the different rooms of the Art Palace.\r\nThere were from seven to eighteen in simultaneous progress each day and,\r\naccording to official estimate, the total attendance exceeded 150,000\r\npersons. The fifteen policemen stationed in the building stated that\r\noften hundreds of people were turned away before the hour of opening\r\narrived, not only the audience-rooms but the halls and ante-rooms being\r\nso crowded that no more could enter the building, which held 10,000.\r\n\r\nAll who were in attendance at this congress, all who read the accounts\r\nin the Chicago daily papers, will testify that it is not the bias of a\r\npartial historian which prompts the statement that Susan B. Anthony was\r\nthe central figure of this historic gathering. Every time she appeared\r\non the stage the audience broke into applause; when she rose to speak,\r\nthey stood upon the seats and waved hats and handkerchiefs. People\r\nwatched the daily program and when she was advertised for an address,\r\nthere was a rush from other halls and an impenetrable jam in the\r\ncorridors. Again and again she was obliged to call upon a stout\r\npoliceman to make a way for her through the throngs which pressed about\r\nher, anxious to get even a sight of her face. No matter what department\r\nof the congress she visited, whether of education, religion,\r\nphilanthropy or industries, the audience demanded a speech and would not\r\nbe satisfied until it was made.[84] Large numbers of the women who gave\r\naddresses in these various meetings paid tribute to her work, and the\r\nmention of her name never failed to elicit a burst of applause. At the\r\nmany public and private receptions given to the congress the post of\r\nhonor was assigned to her, and no guest ever was satisfied to leave\r\nwithout having touched her hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: May Knight Sewall (with signature)]\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that no woman in this country, or in any\r\nother, ever was so honored because of her own individual services to\r\nhumanity. It was the universal recognition of her labors of nearly half\r\na century, that had laid the foundation upon which had been reared all\r\nthe great organizations represented by the women in this congress. Hers\r\nhad been the pioneer work, the blazing of the pathway through the\r\nforests of custom and prejudice which for untold centuries had forbidden\r\nthem to step beyond the narrow limits of domestic occupations. All of a\r\nsudden, it seemed, the women of the world had awakened to the knowledge\r\nthat she had borne ridicule, abuse, misrepresentation, disgrace, that\r\nthey might enter into the kingdom of woman's right to her highest\r\ndevelopment. Long-delayed though it had been, the women of her own and\r\nother countries came to lay their homage at her feet, to bow before her\r\nin loving gratitude, to rise up and call her blessed.\r\n\r\nLetters of congratulation were received from far and wide; one from\r\nFrances E. Willard in Switzerland said:\r\n\r\n     MY BELOVED SUSAN: You are a happy woman and we are all crowing to\r\n     think the people love, honor and call for you so loud and long. It\r\n     suits one's sense of poetic justice; it confirms one's faith in\r\n     human nature and the Heavenly Power not ourselves \"that makes for\r\n     righteousness.\" Lady Henry, Anna Gordon and I have \"hoorayed\" over\r\n     your laurels and said, \"Bless her; she is not only _our_ Susan but\r\n     everybody's.\" Lady Henry says you have the true sign of greatness\r\n     that you are absolutely without pretension. You do not take up all\r\n     the time and luxuriate in the sound of your own voice, but are glad\r\n     to give the other ones a bit of breath too. She says no woman of\r\n     fame has ever so thoroughly made this impression of modesty and\r\n     unselfishness upon her mind. And I say Selah.[85]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Isabel Somerset\"]\r\n\r\nIn her London letter the noted correspondent, Florence Fenwick Miller,\r\nof England, wrote:\r\n\r\n     Amidst all the attractive personalities and ideas presented, the\r\n     most sought of all--the one whose presence drew crowds everywhere,\r\n     who was made to speak in whatever hall she entered, and who was\r\n     surrounded in every corridor and every reception, just as the\r\n     queen-bee is surrounded in the hive by her courtiers, was the\r\n     veteran leader of the woman suffragists of America, Susan B.\r\n     Anthony. At seventy-three she is as upright of form, as clear and\r\n     powerful of mind, as strong of voice, as courageous and\r\n     uncompromising as ever. Let our revered and beloved Miss Anthony\r\n     have the last word.\r\n\r\nThe program for the Woman's Congress assigned but one session to the\r\nNational-American Suffrage Association, and it was the honest intention\r\nto give no more time to the discussion of political equality than to\r\neach of the other departments. It made a place for itself, however, in\r\npractically every one of the meetings. Whether the subject were\r\neducation, philanthropy, reform or some other, the speakers were sure to\r\npoint out the disabilities of woman without the ballot. So strong was\r\nthe desire to hear this question discussed that it became necessary to\r\nhold afternoon meetings in the large halls, aside from those on the\r\nregular morning and evening program, in order to give the eager crowds\r\nan opportunity to hear its distinguished advocates from all parts of the\r\nworld. It is doubtful if the whole fifty years of agitation made as many\r\nconverts to equal suffrage as did the great object lesson of the Woman's\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nMany pleasant letters passed between Miss Anthony and Mr. Bonney, Mrs.\r\nPalmer and Mrs. Henrotin. The last named asked her to take part in the\r\nTemperance, the Labor and the Social and Moral Reform Congresses and\r\nrequested her advice and assistance. She was placed by Mr. Bonney on the\r\nadvisory council of the Political, Social and Economic Congresses. Mrs.\r\nPalmer wrote: \"I should like you to send us special suggestions for\r\nspeakers and topics.\" Miss Anthony was much pleased at the selection of\r\nMrs. Palmer for president of the Board of Lady Managers, heartily\r\nseconded all her efforts and lent no support to the dissensions made by\r\nseveral women who thought there should have been more recognition of\r\nthose who had been pioneer workers. That this was appreciated is shown\r\nby a letter written as early as April, 1891:\r\n\r\n     I feel that I must express my thanks to you that you did not\r\n     condemn us unheard, for I naturally supposed that as ---- ----\r\n     belonged to your organization you would take her view of any matter\r\n     which interested her. I thank you very much for your\r\n     fair-mindedness, and beg that you will read the statement which I\r\n     shall send you and which will probably give you a better idea of\r\n     this unpleasant matter than anything else you have seen.\r\n\r\n     I remember with great pleasure our meeting in Washington, and hope\r\n     it was only the first of many such pleasant occasions for me.\r\n     Thanking you again, I am most cordially yours,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Most Cordially Yours, Bertha M H Palmer\"]\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony spoke several times at the noon-hour meetings held in the\r\nWoman's Building.[86] Mrs. James P. Eagle, chairman, who edited the\r\nreport of the noon-hour addresses, wrote her: \"I would not take much\r\npleasure in publishing our book if I could not have something from your\r\naddresses to go in it. You must not deny me. One of your talks was\r\n'Woman's Influence vs. Political Power,' another 'The Benefits of\r\nOrganization.' If it is your best and easiest way, make the speeches and\r\nemploy a stenographer to take them and send me the bill. I can not\r\nafford to miss them. You have been so very kind and encouraging to me\r\nall along that I shall feel it a Brutus blow if you fail me now.\" As she\r\nnever wrote a speech in these days and could not make the same one\r\ntwice, she was unable to comply with this request.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was invited to speak at the Press Congress May 27, the day\r\nwhen the religious press as a leader of reforms was under consideration.\r\nThe managers became very uneasy and began trying to find out how she\r\nmeant to handle the question. Her only reply was, \"I shall speak the\r\ntruth.\" The speech, delivered before an audience containing many\r\nministers, caused a tremendous sensation. She took up the reforms,\r\ntemperance, anti-slavery, woman's rights, labor, and showed conclusively\r\nthat in every one the church and the religious press, instead of being\r\nleaders, were laggards. At the close the chairman remarked\r\napologetically that of course the speaker did not expect people in\r\ngeneral to agree with everything she had said. The Chicago Tribune thus\r\nfinished its report: \"As Miss Anthony had an engagement she was obliged\r\nto leave at this point, and most of the audience went with her.\"\r\n\r\nThe Congress on Government convened August 7 and, at Mr. Bonney's\r\nrequest, Miss Anthony was present at the opening ceremony and responded\r\nto an address of welcome in behalf of the civil service commission. Five\r\nsessions of this Government Congress were devoted to a discussion of\r\nequal suffrage, the speakers being women. The chairman, Hon. Wm. Dudley\r\nFoulke, said it was not the intention to give this subject such\r\nprominence, but women had shown so much more interest than men, half of\r\nthem accepting the invitation to take part and only one man in twenty\r\nresponding, that he was compelled thus to arrange the program.\r\n\r\nSoon after the adjournment of the Woman's Congress Miss Anthony left the\r\nPalmer House, which had been its headquarters, and, accepting the\r\ninvitation of Mrs. Lydia Avery Coonley, enjoyed the congenial atmosphere\r\nof her beautiful home for a month. At the conclusion of her visit with\r\nMrs. Coonley she went for six weeks with Mr. and Mrs. Sewall, who had\r\ntaken a large house for the season. This was a social center and the\r\nweekly receptions were a prominent feature, bringing together\r\ndistinguished people from all countries, who were in Chicago, as\r\nofficials or visitors, during this wonderful summer. While at Mrs.\r\nCoonley's Miss Anthony formed two acquaintances who from that date have\r\nbeen among her most valued friends--Mr. and Mrs. Samuel E. Gross. After\r\nleaving the Sewalls she spent a delightful month with them at their\r\nresidence on the Lake Shore drive, where she was surrounded with every\r\nluxury which wealth and affection could bestow. This added another to\r\nthe homes in that city always open to her, and Mrs. Gross often wrote:\r\n\"Your visits are a sweet benediction to our family.\"[87]\r\n\r\nAmong the most elegant of the many social affairs to which she was\r\ninvited was the luncheon in the great banquet hall of the Hotel\r\nRichelieu, given by the officers of the National Council to those of the\r\nInternational, the foreign delegates and a few other guests, 150 in all.\r\nMay Wright Sewall presided with great dignity and charm over the \"after\r\ndinner speech-making\" of this assemblage of the representative women\r\nfrom the most highly civilized nations of the world, and Miss Anthony\r\nsat at her right hand.\r\n\r\nOnce she went to Harvey and spoke at a camp meeting of 3,000 persons;\r\nand later to the Bloomington Chautauqua to give an address; then all the\r\nway to Kansas to speak at the State Fair in Topeka and fill a month's\r\nlecture engagements. Two weeks she spent in her own home visiting with\r\nrelatives; then rushed down to Long Island to hurry Mrs. Stanton with\r\nher paper; and back again to Chicago to read it for her at the\r\nEducational Congress. Many days and evenings were passed among the\r\nwealth of attractions on the exposition grounds; and so the summer waxed\r\nand waned, one of the longest holidays she ever had known, and yet with\r\nnot an idle hour through all the four months of delightful associations\r\nand cherished acquaintances. She writes in the diary October 30: \"This\r\nwas my last sight of the White City in its full glory by night.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the many graceful words of farewell spoken by the press of\r\nChicago, may be quoted the following from the Inter-Ocean, which\r\nsuggests the strong and graceful pen of Mary H. Krout:\r\n\r\n     It is pleasant in these reminiscent days when we talk over the\r\n     glories and delights of the World's Fair, to recall the honors\r\n     heaped upon Susan B. Anthony. Her personal friends vied with each\r\n     other in arranging elaborate entertainments of which she was the\r\n     central figure. There were dinners and luncheons, banquets and\r\n     receptions, and at each and all the refined and delicate face\r\n     shone above the board with a beauty and tranquillity far exceeding\r\n     the mere beauty of youth and faultlessness of feature. It was the\r\n     beauty of experience, sweetened and purified by success and\r\n     appreciation....\r\n\r\n     It must seem a strange contrast to the woman who has worked so\r\n     perseveringly in the face of untold difficulties--this change that\r\n     a few years have wrought. It has not been so very long since she\r\n     was the universal butt of ridicule, lampooned and caricatured, with\r\n     all that malice, in its coarsest and most brutal form, could\r\n     suggest. Her age was the favorite theme of the callow witling, her\r\n     cause a never-failing subject for reproach and abuse. It is all\r\n     over and done with, thanks to the new race of men which women\r\n     themselves are training and educating. There are no words for her\r\n     nowadays but those of praise and affection. She has lived to see\r\n     truth survive and justice vindicated. Men no longer regard her as\r\n     the arch-enemy to domestic peace, disseminating doctrines that mean\r\n     the destruction of home and the disorganization of society. They\r\n     perceive in her, rather, the advocate of that liberty which knows\r\n     no limitations either of sex or of condition--a freedom which,\r\n     achieved, means the incalculable advancement of the race.\r\n\r\n     In all the assemblages where Miss Anthony was present during those\r\n     memorable months--the observed of all observers, holding a\r\n     veritable court--her admirers were both men and women, and no belle\r\n     at a ball was ever more unmistakably deferred to. It made her\r\n     happy, as it should have done. But it made far happier those who\r\n     have believed in her all these years, that she should have\r\n     triumphed over ignorance and prejudice, and at threescore and ten\r\n     have come into her kingdom at last. When it is asked what woman was\r\n     most prominent, most honored, most in demand in all the public\r\n     ceremonials and private functions held in Chicago during the\r\n     Columbian Exposition, there can be but one answer--Susan B.\r\n     Anthony.\r\n\r\nThrough all the summer and autumn of 1893 a campaign had been going\r\nforward in Colorado, where the legislature had submitted the question of\r\nwoman suffrage to the voters. The national association was represented\r\nby Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, who rendered splendid service. Mrs. Leonora\r\nBarry Lake spoke under the auspices of the Knights of Labor. The rest of\r\nthe work was done by the women of Colorado, who proved a host in\r\nthemselves. Miss Anthony held herself in readiness to go at any time but\r\nthe friends felt that, unless vitally necessary, she should be spared\r\nthe hardships. Circumstances were favorable; there had been a vast\r\nchange in public sentiment since the defeat of 1877; the question was\r\nsubmitted at a time when only county elections were held and there was\r\nno political excitement; Populists and Republicans not only endorsed it\r\nbut worked for it; Democrats offered no party opposition and many of\r\nthem gave it cordial support; more than half of the newspapers in the\r\nState advocated it. The campaign in Colorado differed from all those\r\nwhich had been conducted in other States in the fact that it was not\r\nleft for women to carry on alone, but the most prominent men in all\r\nparties lent their assistance and made the victory possible.[88] The\r\namendment was carried by nearly 6,000 majority, about three to one in\r\nfavor. Miss Anthony received the telegram announcing the fact November\r\n8, the day after election, and she was the happiest woman in America.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon returning home from Chicago she went to the State\r\nsuffrage convention which met in Historical Hall, Brooklyn, November 13.\r\nWhile in New York she was the guest of Mrs. Russell Sage at the dinner\r\nof the Emma Willard Alumnæ. Four days were given to the convention,\r\none or two spent with Mrs. Catt, in her delightful home at\r\nBensonhurst-by-the-Sea, and a few at the suburban residence of Mrs.\r\nFoster Avery. While here she addressed the New Century Club in\r\nPhiladelphia, and for several days following was in attendance at the\r\nPennsylvania convention. On December 18, she lectured at Jamaica; the\r\n19th at Riverhead; the 20th at Richmond; the 22d she attended the\r\nForemothers' Day dinner in New York and made an address; the 23d she\r\nspoke before the Women's Conference of the Ethical Society in that city.\r\n\r\nWhen not lecturing she was struggling with her mass of correspondence,\r\nattending to her duties in connection with the Industrial School, and\r\nmaking preliminary arrangements for two big State campaigns which\r\nrequired the writing of hundreds of letters, all done with her own hand.\r\nInvitations came during these days to address the New York Social Purity\r\nLeague, the Women's Republican Association, the Pratt Institute and the\r\nNational Convention of the Keeley Cure League; and requests for articles\r\non \"Why Should Young Men Favor Woman Suffrage?\" for the Y. M. C. A.\r\npaper of Chicago; \"What Should the President's Message Say?\" for the New\r\nYork World; \"If you had $1,000,000 what would you do with it?\" for a\r\nsymposium; and at least a score of similar applications. The friendly\r\nletters included one from Judge Albion W. Tourgee, acknowledging receipt\r\nof the History of Woman Suffrage, \"from one whose devotion to principle\r\nand brave advocacy of right have ever commanded my profound esteem.\" He\r\nalso expressed his interest and belief in the principle of woman\r\nsuffrage. The same mail brought a letter from Professor Helen L.\r\nWebster, asking for a copy of the History to place in the library of\r\nWellesley College \"so that it may be within reach of the students.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kansas legislature again had submitted a suffrage amendment and many\r\nletters were coming from the women of that State, begging Miss Anthony's\r\nhelp. She filled reams of paper during December, telling them how to put\r\neverybody to work, to organize every election precinct in the State, to\r\nraise money, and above all else to create a public sentiment which would\r\ndemand a woman suffrage plank in the platform of each of the political\r\nparties. \"I am going to make a big raid to get a fund for Kansas,\" she\r\nwrote, \"but nothing will avail without the support of the parties.\" The\r\nwork in Kansas was not, however, by any means the most formidable\r\nundertaking which confronted her. The women of New York were about to\r\nenter upon the greatest suffrage campaign ever attempted, and toward its\r\nsuccess she was bending every thought, energy and effort, earnestly\r\ncoöperating with the strongest and best-equipped workers in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[81] James G. Blaine died while she was in Washington and the diary\r\nsays: \"He should have lived, and the Republicans should have honored him\r\nas their leader. He _was that_, though not chosen by them.\"\r\n\r\n[82] The newspapers, almost without exception, in all these places,\r\nspoke in unqualified praise of Miss Anthony and her work, of her \"royal\r\nwelcome,\" her \"packed audiences,\" her \"masterly address,\" etc. Several\r\nof them, notably the Bay City Tribune, contained strong editorial\r\nendorsement of woman suffrage. At Lansing she addressed the House of\r\nRepresentatives and the next day the bill conferring municipal suffrage\r\non women was voted on; 38 ayes, 39 nays. It was reconsidered, received a\r\ngood majority in both Houses and was signed by the governor, but\r\nafterwards declared unconstitutional by the supreme court of the State.\r\n\r\n[83] The diary shows a gift for this purpose, during the month, of $150\r\nfrom Rachel Foster Avery and $50 from Adeline Thomson.\r\n\r\n[84] \"More than once--indeed, I believe more than a score of times--I\r\nsaw speakers of eloquence and renown interrupted in the midst of a\r\ndiscourse by audiences who simply would not listen, after Miss Anthony's\r\nentrance into the hall, until she had been formally introduced and an\r\nopportunity given them to express their reverence by prolonged\r\napplause.\"--From letter of Mrs. Sewall.\r\n\r\n[85] Lady Henry had just returned from Chicago where she had attended\r\nthe World's Fair Temperance Congress and here had heard Miss Anthony for\r\nthe first time. At the close of her speech declaring that there could be\r\nno effective temperance work among women until they had the ballot, Lady\r\nHenry came forward and gave it her most hearty endorsement.\r\n\r\n[86] \"As only the most gifted women will be invited to participate in\r\nthese entertainments, we hope the invitation will be esteemed as an\r\nhonor conferred by the Board of Lady Managers, and your acceptance will\r\nbe gratefully appreciated.\"--Note of Invitation.\r\n\r\n[87] As a memento of these visits Mrs. Gross presented Miss Anthony with\r\n$100; and Mrs. Coonley gave her a rich brocaded silk dress and a\r\ntravelling suit, both beautifully made by her own dressmaker, with\r\nbonnets to match.\r\n\r\n[88] The \"Remonstrants\" flooded the State with their literature, but as\r\nthis contained a conspicuous advertisement of a large liquor\r\nestablishment, it defeated itself. The headquarters of the organized\r\nopposition were located in a Denver brewery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND NEW YORK CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n1894.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1894 is distinguished in the annals of woman suffrage for two\r\ngreat campaigns: one in New York to secure from the Constitutional\r\nConvention an amendment abolishing the word \"male\" from the new\r\nconstitution which was to be submitted to the voters at the fall\r\nelection; the other in Kansas to secure a majority vote on an amendment\r\nwhich had been submitted by the legislature of 1893, and was to be voted\r\non in November. In order to make the story as clear as possible, each of\r\nthese campaigns, both of which were in progress at the same time, will\r\nbe considered separately. Before entering upon either, the leading\r\nfeatures of the twenty-sixth of the series of Washington conventions,\r\nwhich have run like a thread through Miss Anthony's life for more than a\r\nquarter of a century, will be briefly noticed.\r\n\r\nOn January 13, she lectured before the University Association at Ann\r\nArbor in the great University Hall--the second woman ever invited to\r\naddress that body, Anna Dickinson having been thus honored during the\r\nwar. Sunday morning she spoke for the University Christian Association,\r\nin Newbury Hall. Monday morning the State Suffrage Association commenced\r\na three days' convention, during which she gave numerous short\r\naddresses. Wednesday evening a large reception was given by her hostess,\r\nOlivia B. Hall, whose home Miss Anthony always regarded as one of her\r\nmost enjoyable resting-places in her many trips through Michigan. Mrs.\r\nHall had contributed hundreds of dollars to the cause of woman\r\nsuffrage, and made a number of timely presents to Miss Anthony for her\r\npersonal use.\r\n\r\nFrom Michigan they went to the twenty-fifth anniversary of the suffrage\r\nassociation of Toledo. It is worthy of note that Miss Anthony had helped\r\norganize this society in the house of Mrs. Hall, who lived there at that\r\ntime. She was here, as always when in this city, the guest of her\r\nfriend, Anna C. Mott, whose father and uncle, Richard and James Mott,\r\nwere her staunch supporters from the early days of the abolition\r\nmovement. The papers contained long and flattering notices, which had\r\nnow become so customary that to quote one is to give the substance of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony lectured in Baltimore February 13, going from there to\r\nWashington. The convention opened in Metzerott's Music Hall, February\r\n15, welcomed by Commissioner John W. Ross, of the District. Among the\r\nspeakers were Senator Carey and Representative Coffeen, of Wyoming;\r\nSenator Teller and Representatives Bell and Pence, of Colorado; Senator\r\nPeffer and Representatives Davis, Broderick, Curtis and Simpson, of\r\nKansas; ex-Senator Bruce, of Mississippi; Hon. Simon Wolf, of the\r\nDistrict; Catherine H. Spence, of New Zealand; Miss Windeyer, of\r\nAustralia; Hannah K. Korany, of Syria; Kate Field; and Mary Lowe\r\nDickinson, secretary King's Daughters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours truly, Kate Field\"]\r\n\r\nAppropriate memorial services were held for the distinguished dead of\r\nthe past year who had rendered especial service to the cause of woman\r\nsuffrage: Lucy Stone, George W. Childs, Leland Stanford, Elizabeth\r\nPeabody, Elizabeth Oakes Smith. Eloquent tributes were offered by the\r\nvarious members of the convention, and Miss Anthony added one to Mary F.\r\nSeymour, founder of the Business Woman's Journal. The death of Myra\r\nBradwell, editor Legal News, occurred too late for her honored name to\r\nbe included in these services. Bishop Phillips Brooks and ex-President\r\nRutherford B. Hayes, both of whom had unequivocally expressed themselves\r\nin favor of suffrage for women, also had died in 1893.\r\n\r\nAt the opening session, on Miss Anthony's birthday, she was presented by\r\nthe enfranchised women of Wyoming and Colorado with a beautiful silk\r\nflag which bore two shining stars on its blue field. She accepted it\r\nwith much emotion, saying: \"I have heard of standard bearers in the army\r\nwho carried the banners to the topmost ramparts of the enemy, and there\r\nI am going to try to carry this banner. You know without my telling how\r\nproud I am of this flag, and how my heart is touched by this\r\nmanifestation.\" From the ladies of Georgia came a box of fresh flowers,\r\nand among other pleasant remembrances were seventy-four American Beauty\r\nroses from Mrs. S. E. Gross, of Chicago. A little later, when Virginia\r\nD. Young brought the greetings of South Carolina, Miss Anthony said:\r\n\r\n     I think the most beautiful part of our coming together in\r\n     Washington for the last twenty-five years, has been that more\r\n     friendships, more knowledge of each other have come through the\r\n     hand-shakes here, than would have been possible through any other\r\n     instrumentality. I shall never cease to be grateful for all the\r\n     splendid women who have come up to this great center for these\r\n     twenty-six conventions, and have learned that the North was not\r\n     such a cold place as they had believed; I have been equally glad\r\n     when we came down here and met the women from the sunny South and\r\n     found they were just like ourselves, if not a little better. In\r\n     this great association, we know no North, no South, no East, no\r\n     West. This has been our pride for twenty-six years. We have no\r\n     political party. We never have inquired what anybody's religion\r\n     was. All we ever have asked is simply, \"Do you believe in perfect\r\n     equality for women?\" That is the one article in our creed.\r\n\r\nThere were many pleasant newspaper comments on Miss Anthony's\r\nre-election, among them the following from the Chicago Journal:\r\n\r\n     The national suffrage association honored itself yesterday by again\r\n     electing to its presidency Susan B. Anthony. She has suffered long\r\n     for a cause she believes to be right, and it is fitting that in\r\n     these later years of her active life, when the cause has become\r\n     popular, she should wear the honors her patient, persistent\r\n     endeavor has won. Susan B. Anthony is one of the most remarkable\r\n     products of this century. She is not a successful writer; she is\r\n     not a great speaker, although a most effective one; but she has a\r\n     better quality than genius. She is the soul of honesty; she\r\n     possesses the gift of clear discrimination--of seeing the main\r\n     point--and of never-wavering loyalty to the issue at hand....\r\n\r\n     For more than forty years she has led the women of America through\r\n     the wilderness of doubt, and now from Pisgah's heights looks over\r\n     into the Canaan land of triumphant victory. Past the allotted time\r\n     of threescore years and ten, Miss Anthony may never cross the\r\n     Jordan of her hopes, but she has led her hosts safely through the\r\n     gravest dangers and trained up others well fitted to wear the\r\n     mantle of leadership. It is the hope of all who have learned to\r\n     know and appreciate this heroic woman, that her wise counsel and\r\n     earnest, faithful spirit may long continue to inspire and direct\r\n     the affairs of this great association.\r\n\r\nThe office of national organizer was created and Carrie Chapman Catt\r\nelected to fill it. The association accepted an invitation to hold the\r\nnext meeting in Atlanta, Ga. At the close of the convention a hearing\r\nwas granted by the Senate and House committees. Miss Anthony introduced\r\nthe various speakers, representing all sections of the country, and at\r\nthe conclusion one of the new members came to her and said earnestly:\r\n\"If you had but adopted this course earlier, your cause would have been\r\nwon long ago.\" He was considerably surprised when she informed him that\r\nthey had had just such hearings as this for the past twenty-six years.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of New York had ordered the necessary measures to be\r\ntaken for a delegate convention to revise the constitution. Governor\r\nHill in 1887 and Governor Flower in 1892 had recommended that women\r\nshould have a representation in this convention. The bill, as it finally\r\npassed both branches of the legislature, provided that any male or\r\nfemale citizen above the age of twenty-one should be eligible to\r\nelection as delegate. When the district conventions were called to\r\nchoose these, both Democrats and Republicans refused to nominate any\r\nwoman. As the delegates would draw $10 a day for five months, the\r\npolitical plums were entirely too valuable to give to a disfranchised\r\nclass. The Republicans of Miss Anthony's district would not consider\r\neven her nomination, although she was recognized as the peer of any man\r\nin the State in a knowledge of constitutional law. The Democrats in that\r\ndistrict, who were in a hopeless minority, made the one exception and,\r\nas a compliment, nominated Mrs. Jean Brooks Greenleaf, who ran several\r\nhundred votes ahead of the ticket.\r\n\r\nThe women then proceeded to inaugurate a great campaign in order to\r\ncreate a public sentiment which would demand from this convention an\r\namendment conferring suffrage on women. To begin this, which would\r\nrequire a vast amount of money, they had not a dollar. No delegate owed\r\nhis election to a woman, nor could any woman further his ambition for\r\nfuture honors to which his record in this body might prove a\r\nstepping-stone. So far as any political power was concerned, women were\r\nof less force than the proverbial fly on the wagon wheel, and the\r\nmajority of men who go into a convention of this kind do so from that\r\nparticular sort of lofty patriotism which sees an official position in\r\nthe near or distant future. On the other hand, the element which is\r\nforever and unalterably opposed to any move in the direction of suffrage\r\nfor women, represented the dominant financial and political power in the\r\ngreatest metropolis in America, whose ramifications extend to every\r\ncity, village and cross-roads in the State. With its money and its votes\r\nthis element can make and unmake politicians at will, and under present\r\nconditions, with the ballot in the hands of men only, it is virtually an\r\nimpossibility for a candidate to be elected if this organization exert\r\nits influence against him. How to persuade the parties and the\r\nindividual men to risk defeat until they succeed in the enfranchisement\r\nof women, which alone will destroy the absolute domination of this\r\noligarchy, is a problem yet to be solved. That the women of New York\r\ndared attempt it, showed courage and determination of the highest order.\r\n\r\nThis necessarily had to be a campaign of education, of forming new\r\npublic sentiment and putting into definite shape that which already\r\nexisted. This could be done in four ways: by organization, by petitions,\r\nby literature and by speeches. The petitions were put into circulation\r\nin 1893.[89] As it would be necessary to use every dollar to the very\r\nbest advantage, the Anthony home in Rochester was put at the service of\r\nthe committee in order to save rent. Practically every room in the house\r\nwas called into requisition. The parlors became public offices; the\r\nguest chamber was transformed into a mailing department; Miss Anthony's\r\nstudy was an office by day and a bedroom by night; and even\r\nthe dining-room and kitchen were invaded. Here Mary S. Anthony,\r\ncorresponding secretary, and Mrs. Martha R. Almy,\r\nvice-president-at-large, with a force of clerks, worked day and night\r\nfrom December, 1893, to July, 1894, sending out thousands of letters,\r\npetition blanks, leaflets, suffrage papers, etc.[90] The letter boxes\r\nwere wholly inadequate, and the post-office daily sent mail-sacks to the\r\nhouse, which were filled and set out on the front porch to be collected.\r\nHither came every day the State president, Mrs. Greenleaf, who toiled\r\nwithout ceasing from daylight till dark; and into this busy hive Miss\r\nAnthony rushed from the lecture field every Saturday to get the report\r\nof the work and consult as to the best methods for the coming week. It\r\nis not possible to describe in detail the vast amount of labor performed\r\nat these headquarters, but it is thus summed up in the report of the\r\ncorresponding secretary:\r\n\r\n     ... Add to the correspondence incident to the circulation of our\r\n     great petition, the sending out of nearly 5,000 blank\r\n     petition-books and instructions to insure the work's being properly\r\n     done, literature for free distribution, the planning and arranging\r\n     for sixty mass meetings in as many counties, and we have a task\r\n     before which Hercules himself might well stand aghast. To\r\n     accomplish this work has taken not only the entire time of your\r\n     corresponding secretary, but that of our president, Mrs.\r\n     Greenleaf, for a full year. Hundreds of women over all the State\r\n     worked as never before, petitions in hand, travelling from house to\r\n     house in all sorts of weather to secure the names of people who\r\n     believe in the right of women to a voice in the government under\r\n     which they live.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mary S. Anthony (Signed: \"Your Sister Mary S. Anthony\")]\r\n\r\n     It has so often been asserted by those in power that when any\r\n     considerable number of women wanted to vote, there would be perfect\r\n     freedom for them to do so, that it was now decided thoroughly to\r\n     test the truth of such assertion. Over 332,000 individual names,\r\n     more than half being those of women, were thus actually obtained,\r\n     neatly put up in book form and presented to the Constitutional\r\n     Convention with a feeling that such a showing could not, by any\r\n     possible means, fail to make the men of that convention and of the\r\n     State clearly understand that _women do want to vote_.[91]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Lillie Devereux Blake\"]\r\n\r\nThe entire management of New York City was put in charge of Lillie\r\nDevereux Blake, and Brooklyn in that of Mariana W. Chapman. While the\r\npetition work was going forward a great series of mass meetings was in\r\nprogress, for which Miss Anthony, who knew every foot of New York State\r\nas well as her own dooryard, mapped out the routes. The management of\r\nthese was placed in the hands of Harriet May Mills and Mary G. Hay, who\r\nproved remarkably efficient. Rev. Anna Shaw spoke at over forty of these\r\nmeetings and Mary Seymour Howell at a large number. Several speakers\r\nfrom outside the State came in at different times and rendered excellent\r\nservice. Carrie Chapman Catt made nearly forty speeches in New York,\r\nBrooklyn and vicinity. Miss Anthony herself, at the age of seventy-four,\r\nspoke in every one of the sixty counties of the State, beginning at\r\nAlbion, January 22, and ending at Glens Falls, April 28.[92]\r\n\r\nThe campaign opened with a mass meeting at Rochester, of which the\r\nDemocrat and Chronicle said in a leading editorial: \"In pursuance of a\r\ncall signed by over a hundred prominent citizens, a public meeting will\r\nbe held January 8.... This should be largely attended, not only in honor\r\nof our distinguished townswoman, Miss Susan B. Anthony, but to declare\r\nin terms which can not be mistaken that the constitution should be\r\nrevised. The negro and the Indian have been enfranchised; women alone\r\nremain under political disabilities. They demand justice. Let it be\r\ngranted freely, and without any exhibition of that selfishness which has\r\nso long kept them waiting.\"\r\n\r\nJudge George F. Danforth presided over this meeting and among the\r\nprominent citizens on the platform were Dr. E. M. Moore, Rev. Asa Saxe,\r\nEugene T. Curtis, Mrs. Greenleaf, Mrs. Howell and Miss Anthony, all of\r\nwhom made strong speeches in favor of the amendment. The list of\r\nvice-presidents comprised the leading men and women of the city.\r\nForcible resolutions were presented by Henry C. Maine, and letters of\r\napproval read from Judge Thomas Raines, Rev. H. H. Stebbins, of the\r\nCentral Presbyterian church, and others. The papers said, \"Miss Anthony\r\nwent home as happy as a young girl after her first ball.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 9 Miss Anthony addressed the Political Equality Club of\r\nSyracuse, and a handsome reception was given to Elizabeth Smith Miller\r\nand herself by its president, Mrs. E. S. Jenney. The next day, she went\r\nto a big rally at Buffalo, under the auspices of the city suffrage club,\r\nDr. Sarah Morris, president, where speeches were made by Judge Stern,\r\nRabbi Aaron, Rev. Joseph K. Mason and others. On the 22d, the great\r\nsweep of county mass meetings began.[93] The scrap-books containing the\r\nvoluminous accounts show that usually the audiences were large and\r\nsympathetic; that the newspapers, almost without exception, gave full\r\nand friendly reports, and although most of them were non-committal in\r\nthe editorial columns, a number came out strongly in favor of having a\r\nsuffrage amendment incorporated in the constitution. \"Oh, if those who\r\nattend our meetings could do the voting,\" wrote Miss Anthony, \"it would\r\ncarry overwhelmingly, but alas, the riff-raff, the paupers, the\r\ndrunkards, the very chain-gang that I see passing the house on their way\r\nto and from the jail, will make their influence felt on the members of\r\nthe Constitutional Convention.\" In another letter she said: \"I am in the\r\nmidst of as severe a treadmill as I ever experienced, travelling from\r\nfifty to one hundred miles every day and speaking five or six nights a\r\nweek. How little women know of the power of organization and how\r\nconstantly we are confronted with the lack of it!\"[94]\r\n\r\nMost of the other speakers were paid for their services but Miss Anthony\r\nwould not accept a dollar for hers, and refused to take even her\r\ntravelling expenses out of the campaign fund. That year she received the\r\nbequest of her friend, Mrs. Eliza J. Clapp, of Rochester, who had died\r\nin 1892, leaving her $1,000 to use as she pleased. The court costs were\r\n$55 and she received $945. Although she was drawing from her small\r\nprincipal for her current expenses, she gave $600 of this to the State\r\nof New York and $400 to the national association, paying the court fees\r\nout of her own pocket.\r\n\r\nA new and gratifying feature of this campaign was the interest taken by\r\nthe women of wealth and social position in New York and Brooklyn.\r\nHeretofore it had seemed impossible to arouse any enthusiasm on the\r\nquestion of woman's enfranchisement among this class. Surrounded by\r\nevery luxury and carefully protected from contact with the hard side of\r\nlife, they felt no special concern in the conditions which made the\r\nstruggle for existence so difficult among the masses of women. All of a\r\nsudden they seemed to awake to the importance of the great issue which\r\nwas agitating the State. This possibly may have been because it met the\r\napproval of many of the leading men of New York, for among those who\r\nsigned the petition were Chauncey M. Depew, Russell Sage, Frederick\r\nCoudert, Rev. Heber Newton, Rev. W. S. Rainsford, Bishop Potter, Rabbi\r\nGottheil, John D. Rockefeller, Robert J. Ingersoll, William Dean Howells\r\nand others of the representative men of the city. The wives of these\r\ngentlemen opened their elegant parlors for suffrage meetings, and in a\r\nshort time the following card was sent to a large number of people:\r\n\r\n     A committee of ladies invite you and all the adult members of your\r\n     household, to call at Sherry's on any Saturday in March and April,\r\n     between 9 and 6 o'clock, to sign a petition to strike out, in our\r\n     State Constitution, the word \"male\" as a qualification for voters.\r\n     Circulars explaining the reason for this request may be obtained at\r\n     the same time and place.--Mrs. Josephine Shaw Lowell, Mrs. Joseph\r\n     H. Choate, Mrs. Mary Putnam Jacobi, Mrs. J. Warren Goddard, Mrs.\r\n     Robert Abbe, Mrs. Henry M. Sanders, Miss Adele M. Fielde.\r\n\r\nSherry, the famous restaurateur, placed one of his handsomest rooms at\r\nthe disposal of the ladies and, for many weeks, one or more of them\r\nmight always be found there ready to receive signatures to the\r\npetitions. The New York World expressed the situation in a strong\r\narticle, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     Within the month there has been a sudden and altogether unexpected\r\n     outbreak of the woman suffrage movement in New York.... Some one\r\n     gave a signal and from all parts of the State rose the cry for the\r\n     enfranchisement of women. It is not hard to discover the original\r\n     cause which set on foot the insurrection--for in a certain sense it\r\n     is an insurrection. It was an appeal which appeared in the latter\r\n     part of February and was signed by many eminent men and women. Here\r\n     were nearly twoscore of names, as widely known and honorable as any\r\n     in this State--names of people of the highest social standing, not\r\n     because of extravagant display or fashionable raiment, but because\r\n     of distinction in intellect, in philanthropy and in the history of\r\n     the State. The reason of the coming of the petition just at this\r\n     time was, of course, plain. The meeting of the Constitutional\r\n     Convention would be the one chance of the woman suffragists in\r\n     twenty years....\r\n\r\n     It will be noticed that these women are in Mr. McAllister's Four\r\n     Hundred, but not of it. They do not go in for frivolity. They go in\r\n     for charity, for working among the masses, for elevating standards\r\n     of living and morals in the slums of the city. They have awakened\r\n     to the fact of the other half, and of how that other half lives,\r\n     and they have expressed their indignation over the small salaries\r\n     paid women for doing men's work; over the dishonest men in\r\n     political places, put there because they could vote and control the\r\n     votes of a number of saloon loungers; over the wretched lot of the\r\n     woman school teacher, ill-paid and neglected because useless on\r\n     election day.\r\n\r\n     And to go back a little further, the most of these society women\r\n     are the products of that higher education which the pioneer\r\n     suffragists made possible. They are women of wide reading, of\r\n     independent thought, of much self-reliance. They began to wonder\r\n     why they could not vote, when the sloping-shouldered,\r\n     sloping-skulled youths who proposed to marry them, or had married\r\n     them, had that right and did not exercise it and showed no\r\n     information and no concern as to the rottenness of the local\r\n     government.... The upper class of women are enlisted. Woman\r\n     suffrage is the one interesting subject of discussion in the whole\r\n     fashionable quarter.\r\n\r\nThis campaign brought also another surprise. In all the forty years of\r\nsuffrage work, one of the stumbling-blocks had been the utter apathy of\r\nwomen themselves, who took no interest either for or against, but now\r\nthey seemed to be aroused all along the line. In Albany a small body of\r\nwomen calling themselves \"Remonstrants\" suddenly sprung into existence.\r\nFor a number of years there had been a handful of women in Massachusetts\r\nunder that title, but this was the first appearance of the species in\r\nNew York. They seemed to be fathered by Bishop William Croswell Doane,\r\nand mothered by Mrs. John V. L. Pruyn. Seven men and a number of women\r\nwere present at the first meeting in that lady's parlor, and they formed\r\nan organization to counteract the vicious efforts of those women who\r\nwere asking for political freedom. Evidently under the direction of her\r\nspiritual adviser, Mrs. Pruyn submitted a set of resolutions, which were\r\nadopted, begging the Constitutional Convention \"not to strike out the\r\nword 'male';\" setting forth \"that suffrage was not a natural right; that\r\nthere was no reason why this privilege should be extended to women; that\r\nno taxation without representation did not mean that every citizen\r\nshould vote; that universal suffrage was a mistake; that the possession\r\nof the suffrage would take women into conflicts for which they were\r\nwholly unfitted; and that it would rudely disturb the strong and growing\r\nspirit of chivalry.\" Another branch was formed in Brooklyn with Mrs.\r\nLyman Abbott at its head and the Outlook at its back, edited by Rev.\r\nLyman Abbott. A society appeared in New York at about the same time and\r\nopened headquarters at the Waldorf. There was also an \"Anti\" club at\r\nUtica.[95]\r\n\r\nThe Democrat and Chronicle published a long interview with Miss Anthony\r\nin regard to these \"Remonstrants,\" from which the following is an\r\nextract:\r\n\r\n     \"This opposition movement is not the work of women,\" she said,\r\n     \"although it has that appearance. There was held in Albany\r\n     yesterday afternoon a meeting at which resolutions condemning our\r\n     work were adopted. Listen to the names of the women who were\r\n     present. Do you see that they are all Mrs. John and Mrs. George and\r\n     Mrs. William this and that? There is not a woman's first name in\r\n     the whole list, and I do not see a Miss, either. This goes to show\r\n     that the women are simply put forward by their husbands.\r\n\r\n     \"Another point: These men who are stirring up the opposition would\r\n     not only deny the right of women to vote but would qualify the word\r\n     'male' as it now stands in the constitution. They say in so many\r\n     words in their resolutions that the right of suffrage is already\r\n     extended to too many men; and they pay a doubtful compliment to the\r\n     intelligence of their mothers, wives and sisters by adding that the\r\n     class of undesirable voters would be swelled by giving the ballot\r\n     to women. These are men of wealth who would confine the exercise of\r\n     the right of suffrage to their own class--in fact would make this\r\n     government an aristocracy.\"\r\n\r\nThese new organizations seemed to be abundantly supplied with money, but\r\nthough they were able to pay for the work of circulating petitions,\r\nwhich with the suffrage advocates had to be a labor of love, they\r\nsecured only 15,000 signatures. The petitions asking for a suffrage\r\namendment received 332,148 individual signatures, including the 36,000\r\ncollected by the W. C. T. U. In addition to these the New York\r\nFederation of Labor sent in a memorial representing 140,000; the Labor\r\nReform Conference, 70,000; several Trades Unions, 1,396; Granges,\r\n50,000; total, 593,544. Added to these were petitions from a number of\r\nsocieties, making in round numbers about 600,000. It had been\r\nimpossible, for several reasons, to make a thorough canvass, and this\r\nwas especially true of New York and Brooklyn, containing half the\r\npopulation of the State; and yet there were over one-half as many\r\nsigners as there were voters in the entire State.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Convention assembled in Albany, May 8, and elected\r\nJoseph H. Choate, of New York City, president. Although only a few\r\nmonths previous he had expressed himself favorable to woman suffrage,\r\nall his influence in the convention was used against it. Mr. Choate,\r\naccording to universal opinion, accepted this office with the\r\nexpectation that it would lead to his nomination as governor of the\r\nState, and he had no intention of offending the power behind the\r\ngubernatorial chair. The amendment was doomed from the moment of his\r\nelection. His first move was to appoint a committee to have charge of\r\nall suffrage amendments, and on this committee of seventeen he placed\r\ntwelve men, carefully selected, because they were known to be strongly\r\nopposed to woman suffrage. He appointed as chairman a man who could be\r\ndepended on to hesitate at no means which would secure its defeat.[96]\r\nIn all his efforts to kill the amendment beyond hope of resurrection,\r\nMr. Choate was actively supported by his first lieutenant, Hon. Elihu\r\nRoot, also of New York City.\r\n\r\nHaving ruined all the chances of the amendment, President Choate then\r\nannounced that every courtesy and consideration would be extended to the\r\nladies having it in charge. Miss Anthony was invited to address the\r\nsuffrage committee May 24, and the hearing was held in the Assembly room\r\nof the Capitol. Not only the committee but most of the delegates were in\r\ntheir seats and a large audience was present. This was said to be one of\r\nher best efforts and she seemed to have almost the complete sympathy of\r\nher audience. She spoke for three-quarters of an hour, and then urged\r\nthat those opposed should state their reasons and give her an\r\nopportunity to answer them. Although there were twelve men on the\r\ncommittee who even then intended to bring in an adverse report, and\r\nninety-eight delegates who afterwards voted against it, not one could be\r\npersuaded to rise and present his objections. It was said by many that\r\nif the vote could have been taken at that moment, no power could have\r\nprevented a majority in favor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Very truly yours, Mary Putnam Jacobi\"]\r\n\r\nThe women of New York City were accorded a hearing May 31, and it was on\r\nthis occasion, with the petitions of the 600,000 stacked on a table in\r\nfront of her, that Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi made that masterly speech\r\nwhich ranks as a classic. Miss Margaret Livingstone Chanler, in a\r\nbeautiful address, also spoke in behalf of the \"Sherry contingent.\" The\r\nregular New York City League was ably represented by Lillie Devereux\r\nBlake and Harriet A. Keyser. The platform was filled with the\r\ndistinguished women of the State, Miss Anthony, Mrs. Greenleaf and Dr.\r\nJacobi occupying the central position.\r\n\r\nOn June 7 a hearing was granted to the women from the senatorial\r\ndistricts, each presenting in a five-minute speech the claims of the\r\nthousands of petitioners from her district. Among these speakers were\r\nsome of the best-known women in the State, socially and intellectually;\r\nand a number of others, of equal standing, who never had taken part in\r\npublic work and who now left their homes only to plead for the power\r\nwhich would enable women better to conserve the interests of home.[97]\r\nThe State president, Mrs. Greenleaf, presided over all of these\r\nhearings, her commanding presence, great dignity and fine mental power\r\ngiving especial prestige to these bodies of women, who in character and\r\nintellect could not be surpassed. The final hearing of those in favor of\r\nthe amendment was held June 28, when U. S. Senator Joseph M. Carey, who\r\nhad come by urgent invitation, made a most convincing speech, describing\r\nthe practical workings of woman suffrage in Wyoming and urging the men\r\nof New York to enfranchise the women of the State. He was followed by\r\nMrs. Mary T. Burt, representing the W. C. T. U., and by Mary Seymour\r\nHowell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Your cause has become the cause of states and\r\nnations. Your success will form a [illegible] for the generations to\r\ncome. Sincerely Yours, Joseph M. Carey\"]\r\n\r\nOne hearing was given to the \"Remonstrants,\" or \"Antis,\" as the press\r\nhad dubbed them. Because of their extreme modesty, and for other more\r\nobvious reasons, they did not make their own appeals but were\r\nrepresented by the male of their species. Their petition was presented\r\nby Elihu Root. Hon. Francis M. Scott, whose wife was one of the leading\r\n\"Antis\" in New York, made the principal address. He described\r\npathetically the timid and shrinking class of women for whom he pleaded,\r\ninsisted that the legislature never had refused women anything they\r\nasked, declared the suffrage advocates represented only an\r\n\"insignificant minority,\"[98] and closed with the eloquent peroration:\r\n\"I vote, not because I am intelligent, not because I am moral, but\r\nsolely and simply because I am a man.\" Rev. Clarence A. Walworth, Hon.\r\nMatthew Hale and J. Newton Fiero were the other speakers. The first\r\nindividual did not believe in universal manhood suffrage and could not\r\nfavor anything which would double the vote. Mr. Hale devoted most of his\r\nargument to the so-called \"bad women,\" declaring there were over 100,000\r\nof them in the State who would sell their votes as they did their\r\nbodies--enough to overcome the votes of the virtuous women. Mr. Fiero\r\nsaid woman was unfitted for the ballot because she was influenced by\r\npity, passion and prejudice rather than by judgment. A letter was read\r\nfrom Hon. Abram S. Hewitt, objecting to the amendment because the\r\nmajority of women do not care to vote.\r\n\r\nThese insults to their sex seemed very acceptable to the fashionably\r\ndressed \"Antis\" who occupied the front rows of seats. How far their\r\ninfluence affected the adverse vote of the convention it is of course\r\nimpossible to determine. While the liquor dealers were sending to\r\nwavering members their kegs of beer and jugs of whiskey, the \"Antis\"\r\nsupplemented their efforts with champagne suppers, flowers, music and\r\nlow-necked dresses. And the suffrage advocates hoped to offset these\r\npolitical methods by trudging through mud and snow with their petitions\r\nand using their scanty funds to send out literature! A mistaken policy,\r\nperhaps, but the only one possible to the class of women who are asking\r\nfor enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nThe committee, as had been foreordained, brought in an adverse report.\r\nThe evenings of August 8, 9, 14 and 15, were devoted to a discussion of\r\nthis report. The Assembly chamber was crowded at each session. The women\r\nhad known for weeks that they were defeated but had not abated their\r\nefforts in the slightest degree. Their work was now finished and they\r\nassembled in large numbers to hear the final debate. The amendment had,\r\nfrom first to last, an able and earnest champion in Edward Lauterbach,\r\nof New York, who opened the discussion in a speech of an hour and a\r\nquarter, said to have been the ablest made in the convention. Nineteen\r\nmembers spoke in favor and fourteen in opposition. The debate throughout\r\nwas serious and respectful and as dignified as was possible with the\r\nfrivolous objections made by the opponents. The delegates showed an\r\nevident appreciation of the importance of the question at issue, which\r\nwas about to be sacrificed as usual to political exigency.\r\n\r\nThe opponents were led by Elihu Root, of New York, who begged\r\npathetically that \"we be not robbed of the women of our homes;\" and\r\ndeclared that \"he would hesitate to put into the hands of women the\r\nright to defend his wife and the women he loved and respected.\" William\r\nP. Goodelle, of Syracuse, chairman of the committee, closed the\r\ndiscussion with a long speech in which he asserted that \"the question\r\nwas not whether large numbers of male and female citizens asked for\r\nwoman suffrage, or protested against it, or are taxed or not, but was it\r\nfor the benefit of the State?\" This being the case, why did Mr. Goodelle\r\nnot favor its being submitted to the voters of the State in order that\r\nthey might decide?\r\n\r\nIt required an hour and a half to take the vote, as most of the members\r\nfound it necessary to explain why they voted as they did. While it was\r\nbeing taken President Choate left his chair and talked earnestly with\r\nmany of the delegates--probably about the weather--stopping occasionally\r\nto receive the approving smiles of the \"Antis.\" When his name was called\r\nfor the last vote he recorded himself against the amendment, and the\r\ngreat battle was over![99] In favor of submission 58, opposed 98.\r\n\r\nNo question before the convention had attracted so much attention\r\nthroughout the State. The New York Recorder led the newspapers which\r\nchampioned the submission of the amendment, and Harper's Weekly and the\r\nEvening Post were prominent among the opposition, a mighty descent from\r\nthe days when they were under the editorial management of George William\r\nCurtis and William Cullen Bryant. The day after the vote was taken the\r\nsuffrage committee closed its Albany headquarters in the Capitol and the\r\nladies returned to their homes. They had raised $10,000 and expended it\r\nin the most economical manner; they had given a year of the hardest and\r\nmost conscientious work; and they did not regret a dollar of the money\r\nor a day of the time.[100] In her president's report Mrs. Jean Brooks\r\nGreenleaf said:\r\n\r\n     These days will never be forgotten by the trio of the State\r\n     committee who daily met to work and plan--to make the campaign\r\n     \"bricks\" without financial \"straw.\" No one with a heart will recall\r\n     the pecuniary distress of last winter without a shudder, and to\r\n     those who had, what was in their estimation, a cause at stake\r\n     precious as life itself, the outlook was often well nigh\r\n     disheartening.... Could the full history of the past winter's work\r\n     be given, the doubts expressed of woman's desire for the ballot\r\n     would be set at rest forever. No more pathetic stories are told of\r\n     the struggle for liberty in the days of the Revolution than could\r\n     be told of the women of New York in this campaign....\r\n\r\n     In closing, we come to the name of one who, we all know, is the\r\n     inspired leader of women up the heights of honor, purity and\r\n     self-devotion--Susan B. Anthony. To her marvellous energy and\r\n     resolution we owe both the conception and the success of this\r\n     wonderful campaign. In her seventy-fifth year she started out as\r\n     one of the principal speakers to be heard in the sixty counties of\r\n     the State; never once did she fail to keep an appointment, never\r\n     once did she cry a halt.... This noble woman, leaving a home of\r\n     which she is as fond as any woman can be, travelled night or day,\r\n     as the case required, not only speaking, but plying her busy\r\n     pen--and all for what? Not for money, for she has stoutly refused\r\n     to receive one penny of a salary, which, had it been paid, would\r\n     have exceeded the sum of $3,000. She gave her services for love of\r\n     liberty and justice, with the hope that New York would prove to be\r\n     in truth the Empire State of the Union.\r\n\r\nFrom the hour when she learned that a Constitutional Convention would be\r\nheld, up to the opening of this convention, Miss Anthony had believed\r\nthat it would incorporate a suffrage amendment which, in all\r\nprobability, would be allowed by the voters to pass with the rest of the\r\nconstitution. She found herself outwitted by the politicians, as she had\r\nbeen so many times before, but while this defeat was the bitterest\r\ndisappointment of her life, it did not crush her dauntless spirit. It\r\nis related of her that as she came down the steps of the Capitol with\r\nthe other ladies at midnight, after the vote had been taken, she began\r\nplanning another campaign.\r\n\r\nAmong the many appreciative and sympathetic letters she received at this\r\ntime was one from Isabella Charles Davis, secretary International King's\r\nDaughters, saying for herself and Mrs. Mary Lowe Dickinson: \"I do not\r\nbelieve you know how tenderly we love you and in what high respect and\r\nhonor we hold you. Mrs. Dickinson was present at one of those meetings\r\nat Sherry's, and she said the only thing lacking to make the occasion\r\nperfect was dear Miss Anthony's strong, brave face looking down upon the\r\ngreat multitude.\" Henry B. Blackwell wrote: \"You are to be congratulated\r\non having made a splendid fight in New York. To have secured 600,000\r\npetitions is itself a victory.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to a letter from Isabel Howland, the efficient State recording\r\nsecretary, she expressed the welcome recognition which she always\r\nextended to young workers: \"Well, I am truly glad for the discovery of\r\nour twin New York girls, Harriet May Mills and Isabel Howland, who\r\npromise to take up the laboring oar and pull us to the promised land.\r\nGive my warmest regards to your precious mother and aunt Emily; how I\r\nhave learned to know and love the two!\" She went as a guest of the\r\nHowlands for a few brief days in the Catskills, and they drove over to\r\nEagle's Nest, in Twilight Park, where Miss Willard and Lady Henry\r\nSomerset were spending the summer.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony lectured at Keuka College, August 7, and on the 22d, gave\r\nthe annual address on suffrage, at Cassadaga lake. The next day she\r\nfound herself thus reported in the Buffalo Express:\r\n\r\n     If, instead of Spiritualists, this great body of people had been\r\n     Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists or Catholics, their praises for\r\n     the firm stand they have taken for the enfranchisement of half the\r\n     people of this country, would have been everywhere sung in song and\r\n     told in story. But the suffrage women of America always have been\r\n     afraid to give voice to the \"thank you\" in their hearts, for\r\n     Spiritualism has been fully as unpopular as woman suffrage; and\r\n     they feared if they displayed too much gratitude for this\r\n     endorsement the public would at once pronounce them Spiritualists\r\n     and they would thus be doubly damned. But there are a few of our\r\n     members who are brave enough to rejoice in the damnation of\r\n     orthodox religions and orthodox politics!\r\n\r\nHer consternation at these closing words was intensified by the letters\r\nwhich began coming in upon her before forty-eight hours. She wrote at\r\nonce to the paper: \"This is all right until you come to the last\r\nsentence. I had illustrated also the danger of expressing kind words to\r\nunpopular political parties, and then I concluded--not as printed--but\r\nwith: 'There are still a few of us brave enough to rejoice in every good\r\nword and work said and done for woman, and to publicly express our\r\nthanks therefor, notwithstanding the \"denunciation\" (not damnation) of\r\northodox religionists and orthodox politicians.'\" The Express published\r\nher correction, but it is doubtful if it ever was able to overtake the\r\noriginal statement.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was very anxious to influence the next legislature, through\r\nthe public sentiment which had been created, to submit a suffrage\r\namendment. For this purpose she laid out a plan of work to continue the\r\norganization and petitions, and herself held meetings in a number of\r\ncounties. It was decided by the committee to go before the Republican\r\nand Democratic State Conventions, which were to be held at Saratoga. An\r\naddress was prepared and a resolution asking for an endorsement of a\r\nwoman suffrage amendment. Miss Anthony, Mrs. Greenleaf and Mr.\r\nLauterbach went before the resolution committee, September 18, which\r\nallowed five minutes for the three to present their case, and never gave\r\nit one minute's attention afterwards.\r\n\r\nFrances Willard and Lady Somerset came down from their mountain retreat\r\nto attend this convention, and after their return Miss Willard wrote:\r\n\"... As for you, our leader of leaders, I wish I could transfer to your\r\nbrain all the loving thoughts and words of our trio toward you. As you\r\nstood before that roomful of people, so straight and tall and masterful,\r\nwith that fine senatorial head and face, on which the strength and\r\nheroism of your character are so plainly marked, I thought, 'There is\r\none of the century's foremost figures; there is the woman who has been\r\nfaithful among the faithless and true among the false!'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"I am with sisterly regard, Frances E\r\nWillard\"]\r\n\r\nFive minutes allowed such women! Had they represented an enfranchised\r\nclass, the whole committee would have been at their feet.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony, Mrs. Blake and Mrs. Greenleaf went to the Democratic\r\nconvention and met with about the same experience. They were permitted\r\nto address the resolution committee and bowed out as quickly as\r\npossible. There was no especial rudeness or discourtesy, but they had no\r\nconstituency behind them, no political power, and in the hurry and worry\r\nof a State convention the men did not care to waste time with them, even\r\nhad they been the most eminent women on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony had a number of urgent invitations to spend the hot months\r\nof July, August and September at various charming summer homes in the\r\nmountains and at the seaside, but she declined all and resolutely\r\ncontinued at work. The hardest for her to resist had been a triumphant\r\ncall from the women of Colorado to come and help them celebrate the\r\nFourth of July. It was to be the jubilee of their political\r\nemancipation, the first since their enfranchisement. The State\r\npresident, Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford, wrote: \"The women of Colorado feel\r\nthat their precious holiday will be less precious if the beloved\r\nsuffrage leader and the suffrage flag are not present.\" At first she\r\nsent an acceptance, but later, affairs in New York became so pressing\r\nthat she was obliged, most reluctantly, to recall it. After filling an\r\nengagement to lecture before the alumnæ of the Girls' Normal School in\r\nPhiladelphia, October 13, she started on the 16th for the final struggle\r\nin Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89] In November of this year Miss Anthony called at the office of the\r\nNew York Sun and had an interview with Mr. Dana, who always had\r\nmaintained that when any considerable number of women expressed a desire\r\nfor the ballot, the men would grant it. She asked him how many names\r\nwould suffice and he replied: \"If you can get a petition of 100,000\r\nwomen it will be amply sufficient to compel the convention to submit the\r\namendment.\" Although more than twice this number signed the petition,\r\nMr. Dana's very first editorial after the convention had refused to\r\nsubmit the amendment, declared the reason was that not enough women had\r\nasked for it!\r\n\r\n[90] A salary was voted to Mary Anthony which she declined to accept;\r\nMrs. Almy received $50 a month; the clerks either donated their services\r\nor gave them for a mere trifle.\r\n\r\n[91] The president's report pays this tribute:\r\n\r\n\"The corresponding secretary, Miss Mary S. Anthony, ostensibly had\r\ncharge of the department of distribution and State correspondence, but\r\nall this was only a small fraction of the labor performed by her. Being\r\npresident of the local club of Rochester, she had charge of the canvass\r\nof that city; and it is enough to say that no city or town equalled hers\r\nin the work done or results obtained. As our chieftain was leading our\r\nhosts through the State, the housekeeping, too, fell to the said\r\nsecretary's charge and, it being convenient for the speakers and\r\nmanagers to stay at headquarters when in town, her family was seldom a\r\nsmall one; and all this gratuitously, be it understood. I can not hope\r\nto tell the story in full, but I trust I have said enough to cause you\r\nall, when you say, \"God bless Susan B. Anthony,\" to add \"and her sister\r\nMary, also.\"\r\n\r\n[92] During this time Miss Anthony gave ten days to the national\r\nconvention in Washington; and the day after the last of the mass\r\nmeetings she started for Kansas; stopped in Cincinnati for the Ohio\r\nconvention, speaking each of the three days; opened the Kansas campaign\r\nMay 4, spoke in that State every day for two weeks; and on May 21\r\npresented herself, fresh and cheerful, at the Constitutional Convention\r\nin Albany, N. Y.\r\n\r\n[93] As has been noted, Miss Anthony spoke at Ann Arbor, Mich., January\r\n13, 14, 15, 16 and 17; at Toledo the 19th, and was ready to open the New\r\nYork campaign the 22d.\r\n\r\n[94] In December Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton had issued an address\r\ncalling upon the women of New York to unite in this grand effort for\r\npolitical freedom. During the entire campaign Mrs. Stanton contributed\r\nto the New York Sun masterly arguments for woman suffrage, which were\r\nwidely copied by the press of the State.\r\n\r\n[95] Mrs. Jane Marsh Parker, a newspaper woman of Rochester, attempted\r\nto organize a club there and secure a petition in opposition to the\r\namendment. Her efforts evidently did not meet with marked success for,\r\nin a letter to the New York Evening Post, she says, \"In offering the\r\n'protest' for signatures, quality rather than quantity has been\r\nconsidered.\" That prince of editors, Joseph O'Connor, at that time in\r\ncharge of the Rochester Post-Express, gave the lady a delicious dressing\r\ndown in an editorial beginning: \"What is 'quality'?\" and ending:\r\n\"Probably she means no more by the offensive words 'quality' and\r\n'quantity' than this--that she has secured to the protest only the\r\nsignatures of a few representative women, no better and no worse than\r\nmany of their opponents. Such an interpretation saves the statement from\r\nbeing insulting; but unhappily very many women in Rochester give it a\r\ndifferent interpretation.\"\r\n\r\n[96] Mr. Choate might claim that he did not know the position of these\r\nmen on this question, but it was so well understood that Miss Anthony\r\nand her associates felt all hope depart when they read the names of the\r\ncommittee. John Bigelow and Gideon J. Tucker had favored a woman\r\nsuffrage amendment when they were members of the Constitutional\r\nConvention in 1867, but, being now over eighty, were not able to make an\r\naggressive fight for it.\r\n\r\n[97] The addresses made on this occasion were issued in pamphlet form\r\nand presented to the suffrage association by Messrs. Lauterbach and\r\nTowns, of the committee.\r\n\r\n[98] Although their petitions contained 600,000 names and those of the\r\n\"Antis\" 15,000.\r\n\r\n[99] Mrs. Choate was one of the women who signed the first call for the\r\nsuffrage advocates to meet at Sherry's; just as, in 1867, Mrs. Greeley\r\ncanvassed her whole county to secure signatures to the woman's petition.\r\nHorace Greeley, as chairman of the suffrage committee of that\r\nConstitutional Convention, threw the whole weight of his influence\r\nagainst the amendment, lest it might hurt the Republican party; just as\r\nMr. Choate did in this one, lest it might hurt the party and himself.\r\nSignificant answers to the threadbare assertion that the husband\r\nrepresents the wife!\r\n\r\n[100] From official report: Emily Howland generously contributed $1,200.\r\nThat staunch friend, Sarah L. Willis, of Rochester, gave $720. Abby L.\r\nPettengill, of Chautauqua county, gave $220. General Christiansen, of\r\nBrooklyn, began the contributions of $100, of which there were, if I\r\nmistake not, seven others from our own State--Semantha V. Lapham,\r\nEbenezer Butterick, of New York, Mrs. H. S. Holden, of Syracuse, Marian\r\nSkidmore, of Chautauqua county, Hannah L. Howland, of Sherwood, Mr. and\r\nMrs. James Sargent and Colonel H. S. Greenleaf, of Rochester, completing\r\nthe number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND KANSAS CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n1894.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kansas legislature of 1893 had submitted an amendment conferring\r\nfull suffrage on women, to be voted on in November, 1894. Mrs. Laura M.\r\nJohns, president of the State Suffrage Association, had written Miss\r\nAnthony in April, 1893: \"Republicans and Populists are pledged to the\r\nsupport of the amendment. I consider both parties equally committed by\r\ntheir platforms this year, and by their votes in the legislature. We\r\nought to have somebody present in each county convention of both, next\r\nyear, to secure a suffrage resolution which would insure such a plank in\r\neach State platform. You see if one party leaves it out the other will\r\ntake it up and use it against the first.\"\r\n\r\nDuring all the voluminous correspondence of 1893, in which Mrs. Johns\r\nassured Miss Anthony again and again that her assistance in the campaign\r\nwas absolutely necessary to success, the latter did not once fail to\r\nimpress upon her that the endorsement of the political parties was the\r\none essential without which they could hope for nothing. She mapped out\r\nand sent to Mrs. Johns a complete plan of work, covering many pages of\r\nfoolscap, arranging for a thorough organization of every precinct in the\r\nState, for the specific purpose of bringing to bear a pressure upon the\r\npolitical conventions the next summer which would compel them to put a\r\nplank in their platforms endorsing the amendment. She made it perfectly\r\nclear that, if the conventions did not do this, she would not go into\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nWhen the Kansas women came to the Washington convention in February,\r\n1894, Miss Anthony for the first time had her suspicions aroused that\r\nthe politicians of that State were getting in some shrewd work to\r\nprevent them from pressing the question of planks in the platforms. Mrs.\r\nJohns had made the serious mistake of accepting also the presidency of\r\nthe State Republican Woman's Association, and had been actively\r\norganizing clubs and conferring with Republican leaders. She insisted\r\nthat she was making woman suffrage the primary feature of her work, but\r\nMiss Anthony held that her strong Republican affiliations could not\r\navoid weakening her influence with the Populists. She did, it is true,\r\nsend out circulars urging the local organizations to work for planks in\r\nboth State conventions; and she did advise the women to keep clear of\r\npartisan action, but this advice could hardly be effective coming from\r\nthe State president of the Republican Woman's Association. Miss Anthony\r\nwrote her: \"My dear Laura, you must choose whom you will serve--the\r\nRepublican party or the cause of woman's enfranchisement;\" and she\r\nreplied: \"Please don't insult my loyalty with any such suggestion as\r\nthis; I have never served anything but the suffrage cause since I began\r\nthe suffrage work;\" and continued to look after the welfare of her\r\nRepublican clubs and arrange Republican meetings.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that a tremendous pressure was brought to bear upon\r\nthe suffrage leaders by the Republican politicians. If space would\r\npermit the publication of their many letters now on file they would make\r\ninteresting reading. That of Charles F. Scott, of the Iola Register,\r\nurging Mrs. Johns to call off her women and telling her the exact\r\nlanguage in which to do it, is a masterpiece of political shrewdness. It\r\nconcludes: \"Try to get E. W. Hoch nominated for governor and we won't\r\nneed any platform.\" As a specimen of pure humor might be quoted one from\r\nCase Broderick, M. C., in which he says:\r\n\r\n     I have thought a good deal about this question and have concluded\r\n     we can recognize the movement by a resolution similar to this:\r\n     \"While the question of the amendment of the constitution, now\r\n     pending, granting the right of suffrage to women, is wholly\r\n     non-partisan and should not be made a test of Republicanism, yet\r\n     we can not view with apprehension the effort to fully confer upon\r\n     the women of Kansas the elective franchise.\"\r\n\r\nHe then closes: \"Some will contend that we ought to say one thing or the\r\nother ... but such a resolution as this would not drive any from our\r\nparty.\" One must admit that it would not scare them to death. Mr.\r\nBroderick, however, was an honest believer in woman suffrage and later\r\ndid attempt to secure some recognition for it in the platform. The\r\nRepublicans sent an agent of adroit address among the suffrage clubs to\r\nexplain to them how \"an endorsement by the political parties would be\r\nreally a hindrance to their success,\" and it was charged that this was\r\ndone with the consent of some of the leading women.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony wrote to Mrs. Johns at this time: \"You know as well as I do\r\nthat not one of those Republicans thinks party endorsement will damage\r\nthe suffrage amendment, as they are trying to make the women believe,\r\nbut every one of them does fear that it will hurt his chances for some\r\nposition and lose the party the votes of the Germans and the whiskey\r\ndealers. The shame for them now is vastly greater than it was\r\ntwenty-seven years ago, for then they feared to lose the enfranchisement\r\nof the negro. Their proposal to leave out the plank now, after they have\r\ncarried the question thus far, is too wicked to be tolerated by any sane\r\nwoman![101] I marvel that you do not see and feel the insult and\r\nhumiliation.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 1894, Mrs. Johns wrote: \"I find a stampede here on the plank\r\nquestion. _Women_ of _both_ parties are going against it. Judge Johnston\r\nof the supreme bench is opposed to it; so is Judge Horton. Do write them\r\nfor their views; you know they are good friends of ours. I am worried.\r\nThe Republicans will hold the first convention, and the general talk of\r\ncandidates, managers and leaders is against a plank. I was yesterday\r\nabout to go into print in regard to it, but am afraid if I make\r\nstrenuous efforts and am beaten that it will hurt us more than if I keep\r\nquiet. Prominent men are writing and besieging me to relieve the party\r\nof the embarrassment of this demand. I am not clear in my own mind what\r\nto do.\"\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went on it became more and more apparent that the women\r\nwere yielding to the pressure. The officers of the National-American\r\nAssociation, which had pledged nearly $2,300 to help Kansas, insisted\r\nthat the women should continue to demand the endorsement of the\r\npolitical parties and let the onus of failure rest upon the men and not\r\nupon themselves. It might not be worth while to quote from the official\r\nletters sent, the campaign having passed into history, but for the fact\r\nthat they may serve as a guide to other States in the future.\r\n\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt, the national organizer, wrote: \"It is very plain\r\nthat the chief fight is now. We must compel endorsement, and I believe\r\nwe can do it. How any man in his sane senses could think non-endorsement\r\nwould give votes and sympathy, I can not conceive; or how the women can\r\nhave a hope of winning without it, after all the experience of our\r\ncampaigns.\" Henry B. Blackwell, editor of the Woman's Journal and an\r\nexperienced politician, wrote Miss Anthony:\r\n\r\n     At the request of Mrs. Johns I enclose a letter from Mr. Wagener,\r\n     of Topeka. He gives the worst possible advice, and Mrs. Johns'\r\n     letter seems to show that she is surrounded by bad advisers and in\r\n     doubt as to her course. If there is anything which twenty-seven\r\n     years' work has taught us, it is that a woman suffrage amendment\r\n     can not be carried without at least one political party squarely\r\n     behind it. In Colorado, for the first time, we have had a majority;\r\n     and Mrs. Catt, and Mrs. Reynolds and Mrs. Stansbury of Denver, all\r\n     say that the amendment could not have been carried if the\r\n     Republican, Populist and many of the Democratic district\r\n     conventions had not first endorsed it in their platforms. It thus\r\n     became a live issue and the masses of voters became interested and\r\n     enlightened.\r\n\r\n     On the other hand, our South Dakota experience is conclusive....\r\n     All three parties ignored it, and the press of the State joined in\r\n     a conspiracy of silence. The campaign speakers were instructed not\r\n     to name it. We had to rely for the discussions upon the efforts of\r\n     suffragists as outsiders. Consequently ... we were beaten two to\r\n     one. The same will surely be true in Kansas in 1894.... If we do\r\n     not capture the Republican and Populist State conventions we shall\r\n     be beaten in advance. All hinges on that!\r\n\r\n     I have just talked with Mrs. Lease, who fully agrees with me. The\r\n     Republican convention will be the first to meet. If Mrs. Johns will\r\n     go before the resolution committee and urge her plank, securing at\r\n     least its presentation as a minority report offered in open\r\n     session, it will stampede the convention and be carried. Then the\r\n     Populists will put one in so as not to be behind the Republicans,\r\n     and _then_ we shall probably win. Do write Mrs. Johns to stand by\r\n     her guns. No one but her can do this work, because she is\r\n     personally dear to the Republicans. The fate of the amendment will\r\n     be then and there decided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carrie Chapman Catt (Signed: \"Yours Faithfully Carrie\r\nChapman Catt\")]\r\n\r\nRev. Anna Shaw, vice-president-at-large, wrote Mrs. Johns in this\r\nvigorous language:\r\n\r\n     I must confess that while I can readily understand the abject\r\n     cowardice and selfishness which prompt men and political tricksters\r\n     to urge the abandonment of the plank, I can not understand how you\r\n     or any other woman with a grain of sense can listen to such\r\n     proposals for a moment. That endorsement is our only hope. If that\r\n     fail us, our cause is lost in advance; for it will show the body of\r\n     the party what the leaders think and feel on the subject, and be a\r\n     tacit command to kill it. The hypocrisy of the whole business\r\n     should not receive from women even a show of belief. What wonder\r\n     men despise us as a shallow lot of simpletons, if we are deceived\r\n     by so thin a pretense as this? I for one protest against it so\r\n     strongly that if your committee agree to it and do not push party\r\n     endorsement, I must decline to fool away my time in Kansas. If you\r\n     give up that point I must refuse to go a single step or raise a\r\n     dollar. I am sick of the weakness of women, forever dictated to by\r\n     men. Experience has taught us what a campaign unendorsed means.\r\n     Think of submitting our measure to the advice of politicians! I\r\n     would as soon submit the subject of the equality of a goose to a\r\n     fox. No; we must have party endorsement or we are dead.\r\n\r\n     If I am not to go to Kansas, I want to know it immediately. It is\r\n     too late even now, for I refused twenty consecutive engagements for\r\n     May in one State, thinking it was all given up to Kansas. The man\r\n     or woman who urges surrender now is more a political partisan than\r\n     a lover of freedom. I care nothing for all the political parties in\r\n     the world except as they stand for justice. I can not tell you how\r\n     even the suggestion of this surrender affects me. For the love of\r\n     woman, do not be fooled by those men any longer.\r\n\r\nFinally, as the case grew more hopeless, Miss Anthony, as president of\r\nthe National-American Association, on March 11, sent the following:\r\n\r\n     _To the Kansas Woman Suffrage Amendment Campaign Committee--Laura\r\n     M. Johns, Bina M. Otis, Sarah A. Thurston, Annie L. Diggs and\r\n     Others:_\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR FRIENDS: I have the letter of your chairman, Mrs. Johns,\r\n     together with one she forwards from a lawyer of Topeka, with the\r\n     added assertion that Judges Horton, Johnston et al., and leading\r\n     editors and politicians, are begging your committee to cease to\r\n     demand of the two great political parties, the Republican and\r\n     People's, that they put a suffrage plank in their platforms; but\r\n     instead, simply allow the amendment to go before the electors on\r\n     its merits--that is to say, repeat the experiment as it has been\r\n     made and has failed eight times over....\r\n\r\n     The one and only sure hope of carrying the amendment in Kansas is\r\n     to have on its side all the aid of the political machinery of its\r\n     two great parties. My one object in consenting to go into your\r\n     campaign for May and June, was to create so strong a public demand\r\n     as to make sure that every delegate elected to the State nominating\r\n     conventions of the Republican and People's parties shall be\r\n     instructed by his constituents, in county convention assembled, to\r\n     vote for a woman suffrage plank in the platform. The moment your\r\n     committee abandons this aim, I shall lose all interest in your\r\n     work. You say: \"Prominent Republicans are besieging us to relieve\r\n     their party of the embarrassment of this demand.\" So did they\r\n     besiege us twenty-seven years ago. No; not for a moment should you\r\n     think of relieving the politicians from the duty of declaring for\r\n     this amendment. If you do, you are unworthy the trust reposed in\r\n     you. I surely never would have promised to go into your campaign,\r\n     or begged the friends to contribute, had I dreamed of the\r\n     possibility of your surrendering to the cowardice of political\r\n     trimmers.\r\n\r\n     If the convention which meets first do not endorse the amendment,\r\n     then the other will not; in which event, its discussion will not be\r\n     germane in either party's fall campaign. On the other hand, if the\r\n     first put a plank in its platform, the other will be sure to do so;\r\n     and then the question will be a legitimate one to be advocated in\r\n     the meetings of both parties and this will ensure the presentation\r\n     of our cause to all the voters of the State.\r\n\r\n     By this means the two parties will run your amendment campaign, and\r\n     you will not be compelled to make a separate suffrage campaign.\r\n     That you can not do in any event, because (1st) you can not get\r\n     either the speakers or the money necessary; and (2d) if you could\r\n     get both, you would have only women in your meetings, and defeat\r\n     would be just as certain as in the eight States which have had such\r\n     separate woman's campaigns. Therefore, if you decide to abandon the\r\n     demand for political endorsement and active help, as the first and\r\n     chief object of this spring's work, you may count me out of it; for\r\n     I will not be a party, even though a protesting one, to such a\r\n     surrender of our only hope of success.\r\n\r\n     I came home for a rest over Sunday, after speaking five successive\r\n     nights in five different counties, in our New York campaign, and\r\n     these letters with the weak--the wicked--thought of not demanding\r\n     of the political leaders to make their parties help carry the\r\n     amendment, raged through my brain all night long. How to put the\r\n     shame of surrender strongly enough was my constant study, sleeping\r\n     and waking alike. No, a thousand times no, I say; and if you do\r\n     yield to this demand at the behest of men claiming to be your\r\n     friends, you make yourselves a party with those men to ensure your\r\n     defeat. The speakers will advocate no measure, and the vast\r\n     majority of men will vote for none, which is not approvingly\r\n     mentioned in the platform. If you give up trying for political\r\n     endorsement, or fail after trying, all hope of carrying the\r\n     amendment will be gone. So, over and over I say, demand party help!\r\n\r\n     Lovingly but protestingly,\r\n\r\n                                             SUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns, of course, indignantly rejected the imputation that she was\r\nnot working night and day to secure a plank from the Republican\r\nconvention. She was a most efficient manager, but the cause of her\r\nweakness and that of the other women, was that they were trying to serve\r\ntwo masters. The very fact that the Republican men were begging them not\r\nto ask for a plank, shows the power which the women already possessed in\r\ntheir municipal suffrage, and they should have had the courage to stand\r\nfirm in their demands for recognition in the platform, for the dignity\r\nof their cause and their womanhood, whether there were hope of getting\r\nit or not. There is no doubt that Mrs. Johns did make an earnest effort\r\nto this end, but there is also no doubt that every Republican leader\r\nunderstood that even if the party did not endorse the suffrage\r\namendment, she and her associates still would be no less Republicans and\r\nwould work no less vigorously for the party's success. Miss Anthony's\r\nKansas correspondence during 1894 comprises 300 letters and all confirm\r\nthe statements thus briefly outlined.\r\n\r\nThe Republican politicians made the women believe if they would not\r\ninsist on the party's placing itself on record and thus losing the\r\nsupport of the elements opposed to woman suffrage, all of them would\r\nvote for the amendment. Should the women of Kansas ever become\r\npolitically free, the publication of these letters would be fatal to\r\nsome aspiring male candidates, but so long as the men still have it in\r\ntheir power to grant to women or to withhold the full franchise, it is\r\nthe part of wisdom to leave them on their files. There were many Kansas\r\nwomen, however, who refused to be deceived and sustained Miss Anthony's\r\nposition. In April she wrote to one of the Republican leaders:\r\n\r\n     If the Republicans had two grains of political sense, they would\r\n     see that for them to espouse the amendment and gain the glory, as\r\n     they surely would, of lifting the women of the State into full\r\n     suffrage, would give them new life, prestige and power greater and\r\n     grander than they ever possessed; and they would not be halting\r\n     and belittling themselves with such idiotic stuff and nonsense as\r\n     their advice to let the amendment go to the electors of the State\r\n     \"on its own merits.\" But however politicians may waver, our\r\n     suffrage women must not have a doubt, but must persist in the\r\n     demand for full recognition in both platforms. We must exact\r\n     justice and if they do not give it, the curse be on their heads,\r\n     not ours.\r\n\r\nThe same month she wrote Mrs. Johns:\r\n\r\n     I can not tell you how more and more it is borne in upon me that\r\n     our one chance lies in securing the Republican pledge to carry us\r\n     to victory, for that will mean a Populist pledge, and both planks\r\n     will mean a clean-cut battle between the different elements of the\r\n     grand old party combined as one on this question--and the Democracy\r\n     of the State. Even with so solid an alliance of the two branches,\r\n     we shall have a hard enough fight of it. Every woman who listens to\r\n     the siren tongues of political wire-pullers and office-seekers not\r\n     to demand a plank, will thereby help to sell Kansas back into the\r\n     hands of the whiskey power. Behind every anti-plank man's word,\r\n     written or spoken, is his willingness to let Kansas return to\r\n     saloon rule. Sugar coat it as they may, that is the unsavory pill\r\n     in the motive of every one of them.\r\n\r\n     Sincerely and hopefully yours, trusting in good and keeping our\r\n     powder dry.\r\n\r\nEnough has been quoted to show the situation. Miss Anthony, Mrs. Catt\r\nand Miss Shaw went to Kansas to open the spring canvass, May 4, to\r\ninfluence the State conventions. Miss Anthony had been advertised for\r\nforty-three speeches. The women of New York, where a great campaign was\r\nin progress, were highly indignant that she should leave her own State,\r\nbut she had put her heart into this Kansas campaign as never into any\r\nother, and she fully believed that, if properly managed, the result\r\ncould not fail to be victory for the amendment. The three ladies held\r\nthe first meeting in Kansas City, May 4. Miss Anthony made a speech\r\nwhich fairly raised the hair of her audience, demanding in unqualified\r\nterms the endorsement of the amendment by the Republican and People's\r\nparties. She closed by offering the following resolution, which was\r\nunanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, From the standpoint of justice, political expediency and\r\n     grateful appreciation of their wise and practical use of school\r\n     suffrage from the organization of the State, and of municipal\r\n     suffrage for the past eight years, we, of the Republican and\r\n     People's parties, descendants of that grand old party of splendid\r\n     majorities which extended these rights to the women of Kansas, in\r\n     mass meeting assembled do hereby\r\n\r\n     _Resolve_, That we urgently request our delegates in their\r\n     approaching State conventions to endorse the woman suffrage\r\n     amendment in their respective platforms.\r\n\r\nThat night she wrote in her journal: \"Never did I speak under such a\r\nfearful pressure of opposition. Mrs. Johns, presiding, never smiled, and\r\nother women on the platform whispered angrily and said audibly, 'She is\r\nlosing us thousands of votes by this speech.'\" Miss Anthony repeated it\r\nin the county mass conventions at Leavenworth and Topeka, to the dismay\r\nof the Republican women and the wrath of the men.[102] While at the\r\nlatter place she received an urgent summons to return immediately to New\r\nYork, as fresh dangers threatened; and so she hastened eastward, leaving\r\nthe others to fill her engagements. On her way, she stopped by\r\ninvitation at Kansas City, Mo., and with Miss Shaw held a Sunday\r\nafternoon meeting at which $133 were raised for the Kansas campaign.\r\n\r\nIn three weeks Miss Anthony returned to Kansas, arriving June 5. She\r\nfound the Republican Woman's State Convention in session, Mrs. Johns\r\npresiding. The committee reported a weak resolution declaring that they\r\nwould not make the adoption of a suffrage plank by the Republican State\r\nConvention \"a test of party fealty,\" etc. Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw\r\ncondemned this in the strongest English they could command. Mrs. Johns\r\nalso severely criticised the committee, but Mrs. J. Ellen Foster, who\r\nhad come for both conventions, said: \"I care more for the dominant\r\nprinciples of the Republican party than I do for woman suffrage.\" The\r\ncommittee finally were compelled to report a stronger resolution asking\r\nfor recognition.\r\n\r\nThe Republican convention met June 6. C. V. Eskridge, of Emporia, the\r\noldest and bitterest opponent of woman suffrage in the State of Kansas,\r\nwas made chairman of the committee on resolutions. The proposal to hear\r\nthe women speak, during an interim in the proceedings, was met by a\r\nstorm of noes. Finally Mrs. Foster and Mrs. Johns were permitted to\r\npresent the claims of women, but neither Miss Anthony nor Miss Shaw was\r\ngiven an opportunity to address the convention. They did, however, plead\r\nthe women's cause most eloquently before the resolution committee of\r\nthirty-five members, but the platform was entirely silent on the\r\nsubject, not even containing the usual complimentary allusions,\r\nrecognition of their services, etc.[103] Not the slightest attempt was\r\nmade to deny the fact that agents of the party had been at work for\r\nweeks among the various county conventions to see that delegates were\r\nappointed who were opposed to a suffrage plank, and that the resolution\r\ncommittee had been carefully \"packed\" to prevent any danger of one. In\r\nconversations which Miss Anthony held with several of the leading\r\ncandidates who in times past had advocated woman suffrage, they did not\r\nhesitate to admit that the party had formed an alliance with the whiskey\r\nring to defeat the Populists. \"We must redeem the State,\" was their only\r\ncry. \"Redeem it from what?\" she asked. \"From financial heresies,\" was\r\nthe answer. \"Yes,\" she retorted, \"even if you sink it to the depths of\r\nhell on moral issues.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Your Brother, D R Anthony\"]\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that any earthly power could have secured Republican\r\nendorsement at this time, although heretofore the party always had posed\r\nas the champion of this cause. There never was a more pitiable\r\nexhibition of abject subserviency to party domination. Men who had stood\r\nboldly for woman suffrage in the legislature, men who had spoken for it\r\non the platform in every county in the State, sat dumb as slaves in this\r\nconvention, sacrificing without scruple a lifelong principle for the\r\nsake of a paltry political reward. While many of the papers had spoken\r\nearnestly in favor of the amendment, the Leavenworth Times, owned and\r\nedited by D. R. Anthony, was the only one of size and influence which\r\ndemanded party endorsement.[104] The Republican managers had but one\r\nidea--to overthrow Populist rule and get back the reins of\r\ngovernment--and they were ready to take on or pitch overboard whatever\r\nwould contribute to this end.\r\n\r\nA suffrage mass meeting was held in Topeka the Saturday following the\r\nconvention and, in spite of a heavy thunderstorm, there was an audience\r\nof over one thousand. Annie L. Diggs presided and Miss Anthony and Miss\r\nShaw spoke, the former on \"Reasons why the dominant parties do not put a\r\nplank in their platforms;\" the latter on, \"Woman first, Republican or\r\nPopulist afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe great question now was whether it were wise to ask for a suffrage\r\nplank in the Populist platform, and here again was great diversity of\r\nopinion. Some thought that endorsement by this party would make it\r\nappear like a Populist measure, and the Republicans would vote against\r\nit rather than allow them to have the credit of carrying it. Others held\r\nthat the Populists carried the State at the last election and were\r\nlikely to do so again, and with their party vote, the Prohibition and\r\nsuch Republican votes as certainly could be counted on, the amendment\r\nwould go through without fail. Miss Anthony belonged to the latter class\r\nand directed every energy towards securing an endorsement in their State\r\nconvention, June 12. Although woman suffrage had been one of the tenets\r\nof this party from its beginning, there was by no means a unanimous\r\nsentiment in favor of a plank of endorsement. This was especially true\r\nin regard to the leaders. Governor Lewelling, who was a candidate for\r\nre-election, was openly opposed, and P. P. Elder, chairman of the\r\nresolution committee, made a determined fight against it.\r\n\r\nWhile the resolution committee was out Miss Anthony addressed the\r\nconvention, saying in the course of her remarks: \"I belong to but one\r\nparty under the shadow of the flag, and that is the party of idiots and\r\ncriminals. I don't like my company. Are you going to leave your mothers,\r\nwives and sisters in that category? I ask you to say that every woman by\r\nyour side shall have the same rights as you have.\" When she concluded\r\none of the delegates said: \"Miss Anthony, with all due respect, I wish\r\nto ask, in the event of the Populists putting a woman suffrage plank in\r\ntheir platform, will you work for the success of this party?\" The\r\nnewspapers thus report her reply and what followed:\r\n\r\n     \"For forty years I have labored for woman's enfranchisement, and I\r\n     have always said that for the party which endorsed it, whether\r\n     Republican, Democratic or Populist, I would wave my handkerchief. I\r\n     will go before the people at your meetings, and though I know very\r\n     little about the other principles of your party and never discuss\r\n     finance and tariff, I will try to persuade every man in those\r\n     meetings to vote for woman suffrage.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Miss Anthony,\" said Mr. Carpenter, \"we want more than the waving\r\n     of your handkerchief, and if the People's party put a woman\r\n     suffrage plank in its platform, will you go before the voters of\r\n     this State and tell them that because the People's party has\r\n     espoused the cause of woman suffrage it deserves the vote of every\r\n     one who is a supporter of that cause?\"\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony answered: \"I most certainly will!\"\r\n\r\n     Immediately upon hearing this, the convention went wild--yelled and\r\n     cheered and applauded to its very utmost--hundreds rose to their\r\n     feet--the cheering lasted five minutes without intermission.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion Miss Anthony thus finished her interrupted sentence:\r\n\r\n     \"For I would surely choose to ask votes for the party which stood\r\n     for the principle of justice to women, though wrong on financial\r\n     theories, rather than for the party which was sound on the\r\n     questions of money and tariff, and silent on the pending amendment\r\n     to secure political equality to half the people.\"\r\n\r\nNone of the reporters caught this and, as a result, the simple\r\nstatement, \"I certainly will,\" appeared in all the Kansas papers and\r\nwent the rounds of the press of the entire country.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage question had its opponents and advocates among leaders and\r\ndelegates. It occupied the resolution committee until late at night, and\r\nfinally went down to defeat, 8 to 13. When the resolutions were reported\r\nthey considered finance, labor, taxes, banks, bonds, arbitration,\r\npensions, irrigation, freight rates, transportation, initiative and\r\nreferendum--everything under the sun but the suffrage amendment. In\r\nregard to that much agitated point they were painfully silent. On this\r\ncommittee was one woman delegate, Mrs. Eliza Hudson, who could not be\r\ncoaxed or bullied. She gave notice at once that she would make a\r\nminority report and carry it to the floor of the convention. The\r\nfollowing was signed by herself and seven other members of the\r\ncommittee: \"_Whereas_, The People's party came into existence and won\r\nits glorious victories on the fundamental principles of equal rights to\r\nall and special privileges to none; therefore be it resolved that we\r\nfavor the pending constitutional amendment.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Miss Anthony, Mrs. Catt and Miss Shaw addressed the convention\r\nand were enthusiastically received. When the minority report was\r\npresented and every possible parliamentary tactic had failed to prevent\r\nits consideration, it was vehemently discussed for four hours, in\r\nfive-minute speeches, Judge Frank Doster leading the affirmative. The\r\ndebate was closed by Mrs. Diggs, and the resolution was adopted, ayes\r\n337, noes 269; carried by 68 majority in a delegate body of 606. During\r\nthe fray a tail in some way tacked itself on to the resolution, which\r\nsaid, \"_but we do not regard this as a test of party fealty_.\" So the\r\nparty adopted a plank declaring that it did not regard a belief in one\r\nof its own fundamental principles as a test of fealty; but in the wild\r\nexcitement which ensued, a little thing like this was not noticed. The\r\nState Journal thus describes the scene:\r\n\r\n     When it became evident the resolution had carried, and before the\r\n     vote could be announced, the convention jumped up and yelled. Canes\r\n     were waved, hats thrown high in the air, men stood on chairs and\r\n     shouted frantically. The whole convention was one deep,\r\n     all-prevailing impersonated voice. How they howled and stamped, as\r\n     though every one loved suffrage and suffragists with all their\r\n     hearts!\r\n\r\n     \"I want Miss Shaw to come forward and give that Populist whoop that\r\n     she promised she would last night,\" said a delegate. Miss Shaw came\r\n     to the front of the platform and said: \"I do not know any better\r\n     whoop than that good old tune, 'Praise God From Whom All Blessings\r\n     Flow.'\" \"Sing,\" said Chairman Dunsmore. The vast audience shook\r\n     every particle of air in the big hall with the full round notes of\r\n     the long meter doxology. \"Let all the people cry amen,\" said Alonzo\r\n     Wardall, who was on the platform. Hundreds of voices which had not\r\n     pronounced the word for years joined in the great, resounding,\r\n     unanimous \"amen\" that filled the hall.\r\n\r\n     Susan B. Anthony, Annie L. Diggs and Anna Shaw leaned over the\r\n     front of the stage and shook every man's hand as he passed along,\r\n     and hundreds of brown, calloused hands were thrust up to give a\r\n     grasp of congratulation. Miss Anthony warmed to her work and had to\r\n     push up her sleeves, but she didn't mind that for suffrage, for\r\n     which she had just won a glorious victory. Many said, as they\r\n     grasped her hand: \"You're going to be a Populist now, ain't you?\"\r\n\r\nDuring the confusion an old soldier came up and pinned a Populist badge\r\non her dress, and this was magnified by the newspapers into the\r\nthrilling description: \"Miss Anthony seized a Populist badge and,\r\npinning it on her breast, declared: 'Henceforth and forever I belong to\r\nthe People's party!'\"\r\n\r\nThe State Prohibition convention was in progress at Emporia at the same\r\ntime, and the women had been notified that a suffrage plank would be\r\nadopted without any effort on their part. On June 13 the following\r\ntelegram was sent by the secretary of the convention to Miss Anthony and\r\nMiss Shaw: \"Recognizing the right of suffrage as inherent in\r\ncitizenship, the Prohibition party stands unequivocally pledged to use\r\nits utmost efforts to secure the adoption of the pending constitutional\r\namendment for the enfranchisement of women.\" This was their response\r\nfrom the Populist convention hall: \"The National-American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation sends greeting, and is gratified that there is one political\r\nparty which does not need to be urged to declare for justice to women.\"\r\nThe Capitol said: \"There was a wild demonstration as their names were\r\nread.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to give an adequate idea of the storm which\r\nfollowed the announcement of Miss Anthony's declaration in regard to\r\nthe People's party. There was scarcely a newspaper in the country which\r\ndid not have its fling. Kate Field's Washington led off with a full\r\nfirst page entitled, \"The Unholy Alliance.\" Editors opposed to woman\r\nsuffrage made it a text for double leaders. Republican papers berated\r\nher without mercy. Letters poured in upon her from personal friends,\r\njudges, mayors, ministers, members of Congress, accepting the published\r\nreports and condemning her in unmeasured terms. Others wrote begging her\r\nto set herself right in the eyes of the public, as they knew she had\r\nbeen misrepresented. It seemed impossible, however, for her to make\r\nherself clearly understood. She writes in her journal: \"One would think\r\nI had committed the unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost in thanking\r\nthe Populists for their good promise and saying I preferred them with\r\njustice to women, no matter what their financial folly, to the\r\nRepublicans without justice to women, no matter what their financial\r\nwisdom.\"\r\n\r\nShe returned home June 20 and all the Rochester reporters were on hand\r\nfor an interview. The following from the Democrat and Chronicle is\r\npractically what appeared in all:\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony was perfectly willing to talk, and this is a resume of\r\n     what the reporter learned: 1. Miss Anthony is not a Populist. 2.\r\n     Miss Anthony is not a Democrat. 3. Miss Anthony is not a\r\n     Republican. 4. Miss Anthony can not say what party she will join\r\n     when the right to vote is given her.\r\n\r\n     \"I didn't go over to the Populists by doing what I did in Kansas,\"\r\n     she said. \"I have been like a drowning man for a long time, waiting\r\n     for some one to throw a plank to me. The Republicans refused, but\r\n     the Populists threw an excellent plank in my direction. I didn't\r\n     step on the whole platform, but just on the woman suffrage plank. I\r\n     went forward at the close of the convention and told the men how\r\n     glad I was to see one of the dominant parties take up woman\r\n     suffrage. I said that we had been besieging the big political\r\n     parties for twenty-five years. Here is a party in power which is\r\n     likely to remain in power, and if it will give its endorsement to\r\n     our movement, we want it.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not claim to know anything of the merits of the issues which\r\n     brought the Populist party into existence. All I know is that it is\r\n     chiefly made up from the rank and file of the old Republican party\r\n     of that State, and that the men who compose it think they have\r\n     better methods for the correction of existing evils. They are\r\n     protesting against the present order of things, and certainly no\r\n     one will deny there is ground for it. I do not endorse their\r\n     platform, but I would be one of the last to condemn an honest\r\n     protest.\"\r\n\r\n     \"But,\" said the reporter, \"it always has been understood that you\r\n     are a strong Republican.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Why has it been so understood? Simply because a majority of the\r\n     national legislators who have favored us have been Republicans.\r\n     Suppose the Republican party of New York, at its coming convention,\r\n     refuses to endorse woman suffrage; suppose the Democratic does\r\n     endorse it. My action with the Democrats would be just what it was\r\n     with the Populists of Kansas. I am for woman suffrage and will work\r\n     with any party which will help us. Remember I say 'with,' not\r\n     'for.'\"\r\n\r\nMiss Shaw finished her two months' engagement in Kansas and did not\r\nreturn to that State. Mrs. Catt wrote Miss Anthony a few weeks after the\r\nconventions:\r\n\r\n     It is remarkable the difference of opinion that is floating about.\r\n     We hear of Populists who are so mad about the plank they declare\r\n     they will go back to the Democratic party. Others, even those who\r\n     are suffragists, are so mad at the women for putting the plank\r\n     forward they say they will vote against the amendment. Democrats\r\n     say there can be no fusion and that will mean death to the Populist\r\n     party. Some Republicans say they will not vote for the amendment\r\n     because it is now a Populist question. Again some Republicans and\r\n     some Democrats say they will vote the Populist ticket because of\r\n     the plank. From all these varied ideas it is impossible to find out\r\n     whether we are better or worse off.... At any rate, the question\r\n     now has a political standing, and it will depend upon party\r\n     developments where we find ourselves. My own hope is that it may\r\n     bring the Republicans to time, but if the Populists say too much,\r\n     it may drive them to secret opposition, and then we are done for.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony took a much more cheerful view and replied to the various\r\nletters:\r\n\r\n     At last one of the dominant parties in a State, and that one the\r\n     party in power, has adopted a woman suffrage amendment, and upon\r\n     that one plank I have planted my feet. The Republicans by ignoring\r\n     us give party sanction to every anti-suffrage man among them; while\r\n     the Populists' endorsement makes every anti-suffrage man among them\r\n     feel that he will be the better Populist if he vote \"yes.\"...\r\n\r\n     Meantime, every Farmers' Alliance picnic, every school-house\r\n     meeting, will be on fire with the enthusiasm born of their party's\r\n     heroic action; for such it was, in defiance of their leaders'\r\n     command to imitate the Republicans and ignore the amendment. The\r\n     900 Republicans in the State convention obeyed their masters; while\r\n     68 more than one-half of the 606 Populists rebelled against theirs.\r\n     Surely there is more to hope from the party, a majority of whose\r\n     men dare vote opinions against their bosses, than for the one in\r\n     which not a single man dares even raise a protest. What would our\r\n     friends have had us do? Bless the Republicans for slapping us in\r\n     the face, and blast the Populists for giving us a helping hand?\r\n\r\nAmong the comforting letters which came during these troublous times was\r\none from Wm. Lloyd Garrison, with whose father she had fought the battle\r\nof Abolitionism, in which he said: \"I saw Mrs. Isabel Barrows yesterday\r\nand heard from her of your weary journey together from Chicago, your\r\ndiscouragement regarding Kansas, and the personal pain occasioned you by\r\nuntrue newspaper reports and the harsh criticism of friends. I write to\r\nexpress my word of sympathy and cheer. Send me a brief statement of the\r\nPopulist matter and let me break a lance in your behalf. A reformer's\r\nlife is full of misrepresentations. How little they signify in the long\r\nrun and, if they did not wound the spirit, would not be worth the\r\nmention. To be misjudged by one's own friends hurts more than all the\r\nbitterness of the rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\nIn a public address made this summer, Miss Anthony referred to the\r\nmatter in the following beautiful words:\r\n\r\n     Had the Republicans of Kansas adopted a woman suffrage plank, and\r\n     Miss Shaw and Miss Anthony declared that, because of such\r\n     endorsement, they would prefer the success of that party, nobody\r\n     would have thought it meant that they had endorsed the whole\r\n     Republican platform, and made themselves responsible for the right\r\n     conduct of every officer and nominee of that party.\r\n\r\n     I was born and reared a Quaker, and am one still; I was trained by\r\n     my father, a cotton manufacturer, in the Henry Clay school of\r\n     protection to American products; but today all sectarian creeds and\r\n     all political policies sink into utter insignificance compared with\r\n     the essence of religion and the fundamental principle of\r\n     government--equal rights. Wherever, religiously, socially,\r\n     educationally, politically, justice to woman is preached and\r\n     practiced, I find a bond of sympathy, and I hope and trust that\r\n     henceforth I shall be brave enough to express my thanks to every\r\n     individual and every organization, popular or unpopular, that gives\r\n     aid and comfort to our great work for the emancipation of woman,\r\n     and through her the redemption of the world.\r\n\r\nTo a letter from Henry B. Blackwell, urging her to be non-partisan if\r\nshe could not be Republican, she replied, July 9:\r\n\r\n     The difference between yourself and me, and Mrs. Johns and me, is\r\n     precisely this--that you two are and have been Republicans _per\r\n     se_, while I have been a Republican only in so far as the party and\r\n     its members were more friendly to the principle of woman suffrage.\r\n     I agree with you that it will be in line with Mrs. Johns' ideas for\r\n     her to work for the Republican party, false though its platform and\r\n     its managers are to the pending amendment; but I could not do so.\r\n     The rank and file of the Populist men of Kansas may not possess\r\n     equal book or brain power with the Republicans, but they are more\r\n     honest and earnest to establish justice, and 337 of their delegates\r\n     had manhood enough to break out of the whiskey-Democratic bargain\r\n     which their leaders, like the Republican fixers, had made. No, I\r\n     shall not praise the Republicans of Kansas, or wish or work for\r\n     their success, when I know by their own confessions to me that the\r\n     rights of the women of their State have been traded by them in cold\r\n     blood for the votes of the lager beer foreigners and whiskey\r\n     Democrats....\r\n\r\n     I have not allied and shall not ally myself to any party or any\r\n     measure save the one of justice and equality for woman; but the\r\n     time has come when I strike, and proclaim my contempt for the\r\n     tricksters who put their political heel on the rights of women at\r\n     the very moment when their help is most needed. I never, in my\r\n     whole forty years' work, so utterly repudiated any set of\r\n     politicians as I do those Republicans of Kansas. When it is a mere\r\n     matter of theory, a thousand miles from a practical question, they\r\n     can resolve pretty words, but when the crucial moment comes they\r\n     sacrifice us without conscience or honor. The hubbub with the\r\n     Republicans shows they have been struck in the right place. I never\r\n     was surer of my position that no self-respecting woman should wish\r\n     or work for the success of a party which ignores her political\r\n     rights.\r\n\r\nThese few extracts from scores of similar letters, speeches and\r\ninterviews, show the position consistently and unflinchingly maintained\r\nby Miss Anthony, and justified by many years of experience in such\r\ncampaigns. During the summer of 1894, while she was being thus harassed,\r\nshe kept steadily on, speaking and working in the New York campaign and\r\npreparing to return to Kansas in the fall. She wrote to the Republican\r\nand the Populist central committees, offering to speak on the suffrage\r\nquestion upon their platforms. The former, through its chairman, Cyrus\r\nLeland, declined her offer.\r\n\r\nTo John W. Breidenthal, of the People's party, she wrote: \"Do you not\r\nthink it will be a great deal better, both for the suffrage amendment\r\nand the Populist party, if in all the announcements it shall be\r\ndistinctly stated that Miss Anthony speaks only on the subject of\r\nwoman's enfranchisement?\" To this he replied, August 6: \"I leave the\r\nmatter entirely with you whether you confine yourself only to the\r\nsuffrage amendment, or whether you add to that the discussion of the\r\nother questions now attracting public attention.\" Meanwhile she had\r\nbeen receiving cheerful messages from the Populist women of Kansas,\r\namong them a long and cordial letter from Annie L. Diggs, written August\r\n16:\r\n\r\n     Nearly everything along the line of my experience and observation\r\n     would make you glad. I have large audiences, say the best and\r\n     strongest things I know for suffrage and always find the heartiest\r\n     response. I see more and more the wisdom of your insistence on\r\n     platform mention. Oh, I am so thankful that I, too, saw straight\r\n     before it was too late to get the Populist endorsement. I have been\r\n     speaking almost constantly, sometimes twice a day, and at every\r\n     meeting other speakers and _candidates_ say the best kind of words\r\n     for the amendment. Governor Lewelling speaks in warm endorsement,\r\n     reports to the contrary notwithstanding. I can not say that he does\r\n     so always, but he did at the three meetings which we held together.\r\n     The Populists who wanted to shake my head off at the convention,\r\n     give me, if possible, warmer greetings than the others. They are\r\n     truly glad they took that righteous step....\r\n\r\n     We Populists wish so much for you and Miss Shaw to come to Kansas.\r\n     People constantly ask me if you will talk for the Populists when\r\n     you come. I answer that you will talk suffrage at Populist meetings\r\n     and will also say that, inasmuch as in Kansas the Populists endorse\r\n     suffrage, therefore the party ought to win. Is not that your\r\n     intention? How I wish I could describe to you some of the success I\r\n     have had in talking to German audiences. But I have not another\r\n     minute only to thank you for your kind words about me, and to say\r\n     again, as I have said so many years, \"I love and revere you.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Faithfully yours, Annie L. Diggs.\"]\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns wrote, August 27: \"I think the Republicans are conscious\r\ndimly of the increasing strength of the Populists. It looks as if they\r\nwill win, and it is generally believed the amendment will go through.\"\r\nAs late as October 12, Mrs. Catt, who had been speaking at suffrage\r\nmeetings for the past six weeks and whose judgment was generally sound,\r\nsaid in a letter from Hutchinson:\r\n\r\n     After all the vicissitudes, hard feelings and distresses of the\r\n     campaign, it begins to look as if we were going to come in \"on the\r\n     home stretch.\" The last two weeks have wrought wonderful changes.\r\n     The tide has set in our favor. I think the chief cause is the\r\n     published fact that we are going to count the votes to see how many\r\n     out of each party are cast for the amendment, and Republicans\r\n     understand they will be in a bad way if they don't make a good\r\n     showing. Since this came out, Morrill has spoken for the amendment.\r\n     Judge Peters, at the big McKinley meeting here, advocated it and\r\n     they tell me it created more enthusiasm than anything else during\r\n     the meeting. Cyrus Leland admits that it will carry. The\r\n     Republicans are coming over splendidly and, if the Populists stand\r\n     firm, we will surely come in with a fine majority. It seems as if\r\n     nothing can defeat us now.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks before the election, October 21, Mr. Breidenthal wrote her: \"I\r\nam confident the amendment will have 30,000 majority.\" Miss Anthony\r\nreached the State October 20 and began her two weeks' tour the 22d,\r\nspeaking at Populist meetings in the largest cities up to election day,\r\nNovember 6.[105] From the hour of her arrival she realized there was not\r\na shadow of hope for the amendment, and it was marvellous to her how the\r\nothers could have been so deceived.\r\n\r\nAt the previous election when the Populists came into power it had been\r\nthrough a fusion with the Democrats. This year the Democrats had their\r\nown ticket, and not only had ignored the pleading of the Democratic\r\nwomen for a suffrage plank, but had adopted a resolution denouncing\r\nit.[106] The great railroad strike and its attendant evils, during that\r\nsummer, were attributed by many to Populistic sentiment and created a\r\nstrong prejudice against the party. The argument was made that if the\r\namendment carried, the women would feel so grateful to the Populists\r\nthat it would result in securing to them the woman's vote, thus keeping\r\nthem in power. This induced many to vote against it who disliked\r\nPopulism, and it decided a number of even those Republicans who believed\r\nin woman suffrage to reject the amendment this year rather than allow\r\nthe Populists to have the credit of carrying it. To destroy the last\r\nhope, word came from Colorado that the People's party was about to be\r\ndefeated there. It was the first time for the women of that State to\r\nvote and, while there was no evidence to prove that they were\r\nresponsible, the bare possibility was enough to stampede the Kansas\r\nPopulists and prevent their giving the ballot to the women of that\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was lost by 34,827 votes; 95,302 for; 130,139 against. The\r\ntotal vote cast for governor was 299,231; total vote on suffrage\r\namendment, 225,441; not voting on amendment, 73,790. There was an\r\nattempt to keep count of the ballots according to parties, but it was\r\nnot successful and there was no way of correctly estimating the\r\npolitical complexion of the vote. The vote for Governor Morrill lacked\r\nonly 1,800 of that for the other three candidates combined, which shows\r\nhow easily the Republican party might have carried the amendment.\r\nSubtracting the 5,000 Prohibition votes which it was conceded were cast\r\nfor the amendment, it lacked 28,000 of receiving as many votes as were\r\ncast for the Populist candidate for governor. Since some Republicans\r\nmust have voted for it, the figures prove that a vast number of\r\nPopulists did not do so. In Miss Anthony's journal on the night of the\r\nelection she wrote: \"Our friends remembered to forget to vote for the\r\nsuffrage amendment, while not an enemy forgot to remember to stamp his\r\nticket against it.\"\r\n\r\nThough she had expected defeat, her regret was none the less keen. In\r\nall the past years she had given more time and work to Kansas than to\r\nany other State, even her own. Her hopes had been centered there. It\r\nhaving been the first State to grant school suffrage and the first to\r\ngrant municipal suffrage to women, she had confidently expected that\r\nwhen the amendment for full suffrage was again submitted it would be\r\ncarried. The events of the campaign confirmed her belief that the\r\ngranting of municipal suffrage is a hindrance rather than a help toward\r\nsecuring full enfranchisement. By its exercise women naturally become\r\npartisan, show the influence they can wield through the ballot, and\r\nthereby create enmities and arouse antagonisms which bitterly oppose any\r\nfurther extension of this power. She resolved henceforth to advise women\r\nnot to attempt to secure fragmentary suffrage, but to demand the whole\r\nright and work for nothing less.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[101] It was the Republicans who framed the original constitution of the\r\nState so as to give women liberal property rights, equal guardianship of\r\ntheir children, and school suffrage. In 1867 they gave to women an equal\r\nvoice on the question of local option. In 1887 they granted to them\r\nmunicipal suffrage. In various State conventions they adopted an\r\nunequivocal endorsement of full suffrage for women.\r\n\r\n[102] See Appendix for full speech.\r\n\r\n[103] The women of the Topeka Equal Suffrage Club, at their next\r\nmeeting, adopted a resolution thanking the Republican convention _for\r\nnot declaring against the amendment_!\r\n\r\n[104] It will be cowardice for the Republicans to fail to endorse woman\r\nsuffrage in their State platform. In past years, when no amendment was\r\npending, the Republican party of Kansas has encouraged the presentation\r\nof such an amendment. Will it now attempt to sneak out of the\r\nresponsibility and go back on its past record? The women of our State\r\nhave shown themselves intelligent voters, in every way worthy of being\r\nentrusted with full suffrage. None of the evils have come upon us which\r\nwere predicted by the opponents of the reform, and they never will come.\r\nTo place a plank in the platform will save many votes to the party. It\r\nis the right, the brave thing to do. What is brave and right has, in the\r\npast, been the thing that the Republican party has done. Let it not now\r\nbegin to do the cowardly thing.--Leavenworth Times, May 17, 1894.\r\n\r\n[105] Miss Anthony did not receive a dollar for her services daring the\r\nyear in Kansas, and was enabled to make the three trips there solely\r\nthrough the kindness of her brother Daniel R., who furnished\r\ntransportation. It was also by his assistance that she had made her long\r\nrailroad journeys from east to west during the past thirty years.\r\n\r\n[106] Fifteenth.--We oppose woman suffrage as tending to destroy the\r\nhome and family, the true basis of political safety, and express the\r\nhope that the helpmeet and guardian of the family sanctuary may not be\r\ndragged from the modest purity of self-imposed seclusion to be thrown\r\nunwillingly into the unfeminine places of political strife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN TRIP--THE ATLANTA CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n1895\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day following the Kansas election, November 7, 1894, Miss Anthony\r\nstarted at 10 o'clock in the morning for Beatrice, Neb., to make the\r\nopening speech at the State Suffrage Convention; arrived at 6 P. M.,\r\ntook a cup of tea, dressed and, without having had one moment's rest,\r\nfound herself at the opera house in the presence of a splendid audience.\r\nAfter she was seated on the platform a telegram was handed her saying\r\nthe suffrage amendment had been lost in Kansas by an immense majority.\r\nYet, in spite of the terrible physical strain of the past weeks and in\r\nthe face of this stunning news, it is said she never made a stronger,\r\nmore logical and comprehensive speech than on this occasion. She\r\nreviewed the amendment campaigns of the last twenty-five years,\r\ndescribing the causes of defeat or success, and pointing out the\r\nnecessity of educational effort beginning with the primaries and\r\ncontinuing through all the conventions and political meetings up to the\r\nvery day of election.\r\n\r\nAlthough she received urgent invitations to speak at various points in\r\nthe State, she declined all and left the next morning early for\r\nLeavenworth; and the day following, November 9, was on her way eastward.\r\nAfter a day in Chicago she went directly to Philadelphia, where she\r\nattended a reception given by the New Century Club to Mary Mapes Dodge;\r\nhad several business meetings regarding the affairs of the national\r\nassociation; then hastened by night train to the New York convention at\r\nIthaca. Here again, without a day's rest, she made a stirring address to\r\nan audience which packed the opera house to the top row of the upper\r\ngallery, sat on the steps and filled the aisles. The convention was\r\nwelcomed by the mayor of Ithaca and President Schurmann, of Cornell. The\r\nlatter invited the officers and delegates to visit the university and\r\naccompanied them on their tour of inspection. Miss Anthony spoke to the\r\ngirls of Sage College after dinner, gave them many new ideas long to be\r\nremembered, and was received with enthusiasm and affection.\r\n\r\nThe next evening, November 15, she returned to Rochester. She had just\r\nconcluded two of the hardest campaigns ever made for woman suffrage; for\r\nalmost one year she had found no rest for the sole of her foot, not an\r\nhour's respite for the tired brain, and yet the letters and the entries\r\nin the journal show her to be as cheerful, as philosophical, as full of\r\nhopeful plans, as ever she had been in all her long and busy life. After\r\njust one day at home she started for Cleveland. The W. C. T. U. were\r\nholding a national convention in that city and were to have a great\r\n\"gospel suffrage\" meeting in Music Hall, Sunday afternoon, which she was\r\ninvited to address. The Cleveland Leader, in describing the occasion,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Miss Willard, the chieftain of the white ribbon army, introduced\r\n     Miss Anthony, the chieftain of the yellow ribbon army, saying:\r\n     \"Once we would not have allowed the yellow ribbon to be so\r\n     generously displayed here. Had its wearers asked us to admit it\r\n     with the white we might have voted it down; but the yellow badge of\r\n     the suffragists looks natural now. The golden rule has done it.\r\n     Well do I remember that in the hard struggle mother and I had in\r\n     paying the taxes on our little home, no man appeared to pay them\r\n     for us. Had I been condemned to death I would not have expected a\r\n     man to startup and take my place. Susan B. Anthony--she of the\r\n     senatorial mind--will be remembered when the politicians of today\r\n     have long been doomed to 'innocuous desuetude.'\" Miss Willard then\r\n     quoted a few familiar lines ending with the sentence, \"And Susan B.\r\n     Anthony has been ordained of God to lead us on.\"\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony was greeted with a rousing Chautauqua salute. \"I am\r\n     delighted beyond measure,\" she said, \"that at last the women of\r\n     this great national body have found there is only one way by which\r\n     they can reach their desired end, and that is by the ballot. What\r\n     is 'gospel suffrage?' It is a system by which truth and justice\r\n     might be made the uppermost principles of government. Every\r\n     election is the solution of a mathematical problem, the figuring\r\n     out of what the majority desire. We have in this country\r\n     mercantile, mining, manufacturing and all kinds of business by\r\n     which money can be made. The interests of every one of these are\r\n     put into the political scale, but when the moral issues are put in\r\n     the other side the material pull them down. Why? Because the moral\r\n     issues are not weighted with votes. The men who are associated with\r\n     women in movements of reform get no more in the way of legislation\r\n     than do women themselves, because when they go to the legislatures\r\n     or to Congress they have back of them only a disfranchised class.\r\n\r\n     \"If you would have your requests granted your legislators must know\r\n     that you are a part of a body of constituents who stand with\r\n     ballots in their hands. Women, we might as well be dogs baying the\r\n     moon as petitioners without the power to vote! If you have no care\r\n     for yourselves, you should at least take pity on the men associated\r\n     with you in your good works. So long as State constitutions say\r\n     that all may vote when twenty-one, save idiots, lunatics, convicts\r\n     and women, you are brought down politically to the level of those\r\n     others disfranchised. This discrimination is a relic of the dark\r\n     ages. The most ignorant and degraded man who walks to the polls\r\n     feels himself superior to the most intelligent woman. We should\r\n     demand the wiping out of all legislation which keeps us\r\n     disfranchised.\r\n\r\nAlmost every sentence of this brief address was punctuated with applause\r\nfrom the immense audience.\r\n\r\nAlways when in Cleveland Miss Anthony was a guest at the palatial home\r\nof Mrs. Louisa Southworth, At this time, with her hostess' permission,\r\nshe had summoned the entire National-American Board to a business\r\nmeeting, and all were entertained under this hospitable roof. For thirty\r\nyears Mrs. Southworth had been among the leading representatives of the\r\nsuffrage movement in northern Ohio, and during all that time had been\r\nMiss Anthony's staunch and unfailing friend. She had given thousands of\r\ndollars to the suffrage cause, and hundreds to Miss Anthony for her\r\npersonal use. On this occasion she presented her with $1,000 to open the\r\nmuch desired national headquarters. One such supporter in every State\r\nwould win many battles which are lost because of insufficient funds to\r\ndo the necessary work.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony soon afterwards went to New York to prepare with Mrs.\r\nStanton the call and resolutions for the approaching national\r\nconvention, and to revise the article on \"Woman's Rights\" for Johnson's\r\nnew edition of the Encyclopedia. She was the guest of her cousin, Mrs.\r\nSemantha Vail Lapham, whose home overlooked Central Park. Mrs. Stanton's\r\ncosy flat was on the other side, and through this lovely pleasure ground\r\neach bright day Miss Anthony took her morning walk. When the weather was\r\ninclement she was sent in the carriage, and the two old friends talked\r\nand worked together as they had done so many times in days gone by.\r\n\r\nThe evenings were spent with her cousin and various friends and\r\nrelatives. Once they dined with a kinsman in his elegant Tiffany\r\napartments. She and Mrs. Stanton, Mrs. Josephine Shaw Lowell, Mrs. Henry\r\nM. Sanders and Mrs. George Putnam, had a delightful luncheon with Dr.\r\nMary Putnam Jacobi. She was invited by Mr. and Mrs. Edward Lauterbach to\r\nhear the opera of Faust, which was followed by a supper at the Waldorf.\r\nWith a relative she attended the \"Authors' Uncut Leaves Club,\" at\r\nSherry's. One Sunday she went to hear Robert Collyer and the diary says:\r\n\"His grand face, his rich voice, his white hair, were all as attractive\r\nas ever; he was a beautiful picture in the pulpit. He gave me a cordial\r\ngreeting at the close of the sermon.\" She ran over to Orange for a few\r\ndays with a loved cousin, Ellen Hoxie Squier; and then on down to\r\nPhiladelphia and Somerton for a little visit with the friends there, of\r\nwhich she writes: \"Rachel and I had a soul-to-soul talk all the day long\r\nand until after midnight.\" She was a guest at the Foremothers' Dinner,\r\nDecember 22, given at Jaeger's by the New York City Woman Suffrage\r\nLeague, Lillie Devereux Blake, president, with nearly 300 prominent\r\nwomen at the table.[107] The dinner and the speeches lasted until after\r\n5 o'clock, Miss Anthony responding to the toast, \"Our Future Policy.\"\r\n\r\nThus a month slipped pleasantly by, and then, with the work all\r\nfinished, the body rested and the mind refreshed, she returned home to\r\nspend Christmas. The two sisters dined with Dr. and Mrs. F. H. Sanford\r\nand a few old-time friends, and passed a happy day. Among the numerous\r\nChristmas remembrances were several pieces of fine china and an elegant\r\nvelvet cloak from Mrs. Gross.[108]\r\n\r\nOn December 30, Miss Anthony received word of the death of her old\r\nco-worker, Amelia Bloomer, at Council Bluffs, Ia., aged seventy-seven,\r\nand sent a telegram of sympathy to the husband. A death felt most keenly\r\nin 1894 was that of Virginia L. Minor, of St. Louis, August 14, which\r\nclosed a beautiful and unbroken friendship of thirty years. She left\r\nMiss Anthony a testimonial of her love and confidence in a legacy of\r\n$1,000.\r\n\r\nThe year ended amidst the usual pressure of requests, invitations and\r\nengagements. Would she lecture for the Art League, for the Musical\r\nSociety, for the Church Guild and for a dozen other organizations of\r\nwhose purposes she knew practically nothing? Would she accept a\r\n\"reception\" from the Scribblers' Club of Buffalo? Would she send a\r\npackage of documents to the girls of Vassar College, who were going to\r\ndebate woman suffrage? Would she please reply to the following\r\nquestions, from various newspapers: \"Have not women as many rights now\r\nas men have? What is woman's ideal existence and what woman has most\r\nnearly attained it? Have you formed any resolutions for the coming year,\r\nand what has been the fate of former New Year's resolutions?\" and so on,\r\nad infinitum.\r\n\r\nThe \"woman's edition\" fever raged with great violence at this time, and\r\nit is not an exaggeration to say that the editors of ninety-nine\r\nhundredths of them wrote to Miss Anthony for an article. Of course it\r\nwas an impossibility to comply, but occasionally some request struck her\r\nso forcibly that she made time for an answer. For instance, the woman's\r\nedition of the Elmira Daily Advertiser was for the purpose of helping\r\nthe Young Men's Christian Association, and to its editor, Mrs. J. Sloat\r\nFassett, she wrote:\r\n\r\n     I should feel vastly more interested in, and earnest to aid the Y.\r\n     M. C. A., if the men composing it were, as a body, helping to\r\n     educate the people into the recognition of the right of their\r\n     mothers and sisters to an equal voice with themselves in the\r\n     government of the city, State and nation. Nevertheless, I avail\r\n     myself of your kindly request, and urge all to study the intricate\r\n     problem of bettering the world; not merely the individual\r\n     sufferings in it, but the general conditions. Such study will show\r\n     the great need of a new balance of power in the body politic; and\r\n     the conscientious student must arrive at the conclusion that this\r\n     will have to be obtained by enfranchising a new class--women. If\r\n     the Y. M. C. A. really desire to make better moral and social\r\n     conditions possible, they should hasten to obey the injunction of\r\n     St. Paul, and \"help those women\" who are working to secure\r\n     enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony received soon after this a consignment of pamphlets, etc.,\r\nthat she had ordered printed, on the outside of which the manager of the\r\nprinting house, a man entirely unknown to her, had written:\r\n\r\n    \"A wreath, twine a wreath for the brave and the true,\r\n    Who, for love of the many, dared stand with the few.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the pleasant letters was one from Mrs. Mary B. Willard, who was\r\nthen abroad, in which she said: \"I am so glad that you live on to know\r\nhow much you are loved and to enjoy the fruit of your blessed labors.\"\r\nOne invitation which Miss Anthony especially appreciated came from Rev.\r\nJenkin Lloyd Jones, of Chicago, editor of Unity and pastor of All Souls\r\nchurch: \"I am sure your heart goes out with us in our dreams as\r\nrepresented by the enclosed printed matter.[109] One number of the\r\nprogram is, 'What is woman's part in this larger synthesis,' or 'What\r\ncan woman do for liberal religion?' I enclose Dr. Thomas' letter that it\r\nmay reinforce my own pleading that you should come and speak on this\r\ntopic. Phrase it yourself. Pour your whole heart into it. Make it the\r\nspeech of your life. Give your large religious nature freedom. We will\r\npay all your expenses and I do hope you will make an effort to come. We\r\nwill give you from thirty to forty minutes, then we would want to ask\r\none or two women to follow in the discussion, perhaps a Jewess and may\r\nbe some woman who represents the independent church, like Dr. Thomas'\r\nand Prof. Swing's....\"\r\n\r\nDr. H. W. Thomas' letter said in part: \"Your suggestion is wise; no\r\nother can perhaps so fittingly and ably represent the larger place and\r\nwork of woman as Susan B. Anthony. It will honor her and help the cause\r\nto have her speak at the congress. Bless her dear soul, how I would like\r\nto see her--to hear her--to have her one with us--her counsel, her\r\nspirit, her great heart of love and hope so much like the Christ.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the receipt of Miss Anthony's reply Dr. Jones wrote again: \"I\r\nreceived your modest protest against being made, as you are, one of the\r\nvice-presidents of the Liberal Congress organization; but the very\r\nreason you urged against it is the very reason for putting you on. We\r\nwant you not for what you can do but for what you are. We can not take\r\nthe congress into the polemics of the woman question, but George\r\nWashington went into the first Continental Congress with his uniform on,\r\nsaid nothing, yet that was his speech. So we organize with Susan B.\r\nAnthony's name among our vice-presidents, and this is our war speech on\r\nthat question. Do let your name stay there.... Ever rejoicing in your\r\nwork and its slowly approaching triumph, I am, brotherly yours.\"\r\n\r\nThe New Year of 1895 promised less in the way of work and anxiety than\r\nthe one which had just closed. There were to be no State amendment\r\ncampaigns with their annoying complexities, their arduous labors, their\r\nusual defeats. So many capable and energetic women had come into the\r\nnational organization that Miss Anthony was relieved of much of the\r\nburden which used to rest upon her in the olden times, when she had to\r\nattend personally to details of arrangement and assume the financial\r\nresponsibility. She found it difficult at first to adapt herself to the\r\nnew regime, but soon learned to have confidence in the judgment and\r\nability of her much-loved \"body guard,\" as she liked to call the\r\nofficial board. It was not so easy for others of the old workers to\r\naccept the new order of things, and they rebelled occasionally against\r\nthe \"red tape\" requirements of this executive body. To one of these Miss\r\nAnthony wrote: \"My dear, what we older ones all have to learn is that\r\nthese young and active women now doing the drudgery in each of the\r\nforty-five States, must be consulted and must have a vote on all\r\nquestions pertaining to the association, and we must abide by the\r\ndecision of the majority. This is what I am trying to learn. No one or\r\ntwo can manage now, but all must have a voice.\"\r\n\r\nThe voluminous correspondence shows, however, that the new workers were\r\nvery glad to feel the touch of her firm and experienced hand on the\r\nhelm, and that usually she was consulted on every point. She especially\r\nimpressed upon them the necessity of keeping the financial accounts with\r\nthe strictest care and accuracy, and for a number of years would not\r\nallow a report to be published until she herself had examined every\r\ndetail. At one time when two contributions had been accidentally omitted\r\nfrom the statement sent for her inspection, she wrote: \"Not finding\r\nthose two in your copy congealed the blood to the very ends of my\r\nfingers and toes, lest the givers should think I had not sent their\r\nmoney to you.\"\r\n\r\nNew Year's Day twelve friends were gathered around the Anthony table,\r\nthe Gannetts, the Greenleafs, the Sanfords, Mrs. Hallowell and Mrs.\r\nWillis, and the occasion was a pleasant one. A week later Miss Anthony\r\nstarted on an extended southern trip. There had been practically no\r\nsuffrage work done in the South, with the exception of Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, Missouri and Louisiana. As the national convention was to\r\nmeet in Atlanta, Miss Anthony thought it advisable to make a lecture\r\ntour through the South to arouse a sentiment which might be felt there a\r\nmonth later. She invited Mrs. Chapman Catt to accompany her,\r\nguaranteeing her expenses although she had no assurance she would be\r\nable to make even her own.\r\n\r\nAt Lexington they were guests in the fine old home of Mrs. Mary J.\r\nWarfield Clay and daughter Laura, and spoke in the Christian church to a\r\nsympathetic audience. They held meetings at Wilmore, Louisville,\r\nOwensboro, Paducah and Milan, receiving many social courtesies at each\r\nplace visited, and they reached Memphis January 17. The management here\r\nwas in the capable hands of the Woman's Council and a fine audience\r\ngreeted them at the Young Men's Hebrew Association Hall. They were\r\nintroduced by their hostess, Mrs. Lide Meriwether, president of the\r\nEqual Suffrage Club, and cordially received. The Appeal, Avalanche and\r\nScimitar gave long and interesting reports. The next morning Miss\r\nAnthony and Mrs. Catt were handsomely entertained by the ladies of the\r\nNineteenth Century Club. In the afternoon Mrs. Mary Jameson Judah,\r\npresident of the Woman's Club, gave a reception in their honor. Saturday\r\nmorning they were guests of the Colored Women's Club; in the afternoon\r\nthe Woman's Council, composed of forty-six local clubs, tendered a large\r\nreception, and in the evening they lectured again. Sunday morning they\r\nspoke in the Tabernacle to the colored people; and they left at 5.30 P.\r\nM. feeling they had not wasted much time at Memphis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"For your lifelong work for Truth and Liberty\r\nI am, Gratefully yours, Laura Clay.\"]\r\n\r\nThey reached New Orleans Monday morning; were met at the train by the\r\npresident and several members of the Portia Club, and escorted to the\r\nresidence of Judge Merrick. Each of the daily papers contained lengthy\r\nand excellent mention of the lectures. The Picayune said at the\r\nbeginning of a four-column report:\r\n\r\n     If any one doubted the interest that southern women feel in the\r\n     all-absorbing question of the day, \"Woman and her Rights,\" that\r\n     idea would have forever been dispelled by a glance at the splendid\r\n     audience assembled last night to hear Miss Susan B. Anthony, the\r\n     world-famed apostle of woman suffrage, and Mrs. Carrie Chapman\r\n     Catt, the distinguished western leader. The hall was literally\r\n     packed to overflowing, not only with women but with men, prominent\r\n     representatives in every walk of life. Standing room was at a\r\n     premium, corridors and windows were filled with a sea of earnest,\r\n     interested faces, the name of Miss Anthony was on every lip, and\r\n     all eyes were directed to the platform, which was beautifully\r\n     decorated with palms and potted plants, the suffrage color, yellow,\r\n     predominating among the verdant foliage.\r\n\r\n     Seated upon the platform were the four ladies who have successively\r\n     filled the position of president of the Portia Club, Mrs. Elizabeth\r\n     Lyle Saxon, Mrs. Caroline E. Merrick, Mrs. Evelyn B. Ordway and\r\n     Miss Florence Huberwald. The entrance of Miss Anthony and Mrs. Catt\r\n     was the signal for a burst of applause, which rose into an ovation\r\n     when Miss Huberwald, in a few graceful words, presented Mrs.\r\n     Merrick, who in turn introduced Miss Anthony as the most famous\r\n     woman in America. When the applause subsided, Miss Anthony, whose\r\n     voice is singularly sweet and clear, began to speak.\r\n\r\nShe was presented with a basket of flowers and a bouquet from Mrs. J. M.\r\nFerguson, president of the Arena club. At the close hundreds pressed\r\nforward to take the hands of the speakers.\r\n\r\nThey left this charming and hospitable city Wednesday evening, Mrs. Catt\r\ngoing to Greenville, Miss Anthony to Shreveport. Here she was\r\nentertained by Mrs. M. F. Smith and Professor C. E. Byrd, principal of\r\nthe high school. The Hypatia Club sent her two lovely floral offerings.\r\nOf her lecture the Times said editorially:\r\n\r\n     This veteran apostle of woman's rights addressed a magnificent\r\n     audience last evening at the court-house, a representative\r\n     assemblage comprising all the best elements of all the best classes\r\n     of Shreveport's citizens, and one which was equally divided between\r\n     men and women. Miss Anthony is certainly a remarkable woman in\r\n     every respect, and one whose genius will leave its mark not only on\r\n     the recorded history of the nineteenth century, but in the advanced\r\n     position of woman now and for all time to come. She was one of the\r\n     first women in America to raise her voice in advocacy of woman's\r\n     rights, and she has lived to see herself and her sisters gradually\r\n     released from legalized bondage and, in everything but suffrage,\r\n     made the full equal of man. No one can deny that her claims are\r\n     founded on justice; and in the light of cold and clear reason,\r\n     divested of all sentiment and cleansed of all prejudice, her\r\n     arguments can not be successfully controverted.\r\n\r\nBy failure of the train to connect with the ferry she was unable to join\r\nMrs. Catt and keep her appointment at Jackson. When, after waiting two\r\nhours, she finally reached that station at half-past nine, she found a\r\nmessage from Mrs. Catt that she was holding a magnificent audience for\r\nher. According to her journal she \"was too oozed-out even to be looked\r\nat, much less to try to speak in the House of Representatives packed\r\nwith the flower of southern chivalry;\" so she went on to Birmingham.\r\nHere she found inadequate arrangements had been made and a northern\r\nblizzard interfered with her meetings. The News, however, gave an\r\nexcellent two-column account beginning:\r\n\r\n     Only a moderate audience greeted Susan B. Anthony, the chief\r\n     suffrage leader in the United States, but that audience was\r\n     cultured and able to appreciate the very energetic, clear-minded\r\n     and vigorous woman, whose name is as well-known as that of any man\r\n     in the Union, and who has done more than any other woman to prove,\r\n     by her strong and unique personality, the mental equality of woman\r\n     with man and her fitness for the things sought to be entrusted to\r\n     her care, share and share alike with the sterner sex. After a\r\n     graceful introduction by Colonel J. W. Bush, the lecturer plunged\r\n     at once with ease and distinction into her subject and line of\r\n     argument.... She is a very able and incisive speaker, talks\r\n     fluently and distinctly, and makes easy and graceful gestures. In a\r\n     word, she is as good a lecturer as a good man-lecturer.\r\n\r\nThey spoke in the opera house at New Decatur, and were the guests of\r\nMrs. E. S. Hildreth. At Huntsville they were entertained by Mrs. Milton\r\nHume, and introduced to the audience by Mrs. Clay-Klopton. The Evening\r\nTribune headed its report, \"Grand and Enthusiastic Meeting; Eloquent\r\nAddresses Presented by Noble and Gifted Women;\" and said:\r\n\r\n     Much to the surprise of a great many, the city hall was filled last\r\n     night with a very large and intelligent audience of ladies and\r\n     gentlemen.... Miss Anthony spoke for an hour in a plain, unassuming\r\n     manner, but ably and learnedly. She has been an active worker for\r\n     more than forty years in this cause and now, at life's closing\r\n     hours, sees the right accorded woman in the States of Wyoming and\r\n     Colorado, and the cause gaining momentum as intelligence spreads\r\n     and the blessings become known which follow in the pathway of\r\n     woman's ballot. No one can look upon the face of that venerated,\r\n     noble woman, who has grown gray in her life-work, and not be\r\n     impressed that there has been something more than sentiment, more\r\n     than a cranky idea, impelling her in all these long, sacrificing\r\n     years.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Chapman Catt as completely charmed as she surprised the large\r\n     audience. She is a young woman of winning personality, as beautiful\r\n     as she is brilliant, with a command of language and convincing\r\n     eloquence that would do credit to the matchless Prentiss....\r\n\r\nThe next day, with Mrs. Alberta Chapman Taylor, they started for\r\nAtlanta, joining the Kentucky delegation at Knoxville and reaching their\r\ndestination at noon. The headquarters were at the Aragon, where they\r\nfound a large number of delegates, warm rooms and everything bright and\r\ncomfortable, with the promise of a fine meeting.\r\n\r\nThe Twenty-seventh Annual Convention opened at De Give's opera house,\r\nJanuary 31, continuing six days. Ninety-three delegates were present\r\nfrom twenty-eight states, numbers were in attendance from southern\r\ncities, and the people of Atlanta turned out en masse. An evidence of\r\nthe interest taken in this convention is the fact that a number of the\r\nNew York papers had daily reports of several thousand words telegraphed,\r\nand the large newspapers throughout the country had extended accounts.\r\nThe Atlanta Constitution had had columns of matter pertaining to it,\r\npictures and personal descriptions of the prominent women, which, added\r\nto its extended daily reports, contributed largely to the success of the\r\nmeeting; but it was as careful to avoid editorial endorsement as its\r\ncontemporaries in the North. The other city papers were generous with\r\nspace and complimentary mention, but the Sunny South, edited by Colonel\r\nHenry Clay Fairman, was the only one which advocated the principle of\r\nwoman suffrage.\r\n\r\nMany beautiful homes were opened to the visitors, and all the officers\r\nand speakers were entertained at the Aragon at the expense of the newly\r\nformed Georgia State Association. The most of it was borne, in fact, by\r\nthree sisters residing at Columbus, H. Augusta Howard, Miriam Howard Du\r\nBose and Claudia Howard Maxwell. With the genuine southern hospitality,\r\nthey declined the offer of several societies and of the association to\r\nreimburse them. A handsome reception at the hotel was attended by\r\nhundreds of Atlanta's representative citizens. Mrs. W. A. Hemphill, one\r\nof the board of the Atlanta Exposition, received the visitors in her\r\nlovely home, assisted by the wife of the recently-elected Governor\r\nAtkinson.\r\n\r\nA Baptist preacher, Rev. J. B. Hawthorne, built on the antiquated plan,\r\ndelivered a sermon not only denouncing suffrage but abusing its\r\nadvocates. The result was to make the other ministers in the city offer\r\ntheir pulpits to the convention speakers, and on Sunday lectures were\r\ngiven in various churches by Emily Howland, Elizabeth Upham Yates, Mrs.\r\nColby and Mrs. Meriwether. Rev. Anna Shaw preached in the opera house\r\nand the Constitution prefaced its report as follows: \"When the opening\r\nhour arrived there was not an empty chair in the house. So dense became\r\nthe crowd that the doors were ordered closed before the services began.\r\nThe vast congregation was made up of all classes of citizens. Every\r\nchair that could be found had been utilized and then boxes and benches\r\nwere pressed into service. Many prominent professional and business men\r\nwere standing on the stage and in different parts of the house.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony, besides her president's address, made many brief speeches\r\nand also read Mrs. Stanton's fine paper on \"Educated Suffrage,\" which\r\nwas especially acceptable to a southern audience.[110] One of the most\r\neloquent speakers was General Robert R. Hemphill, member of the South\r\nCarolina legislature. Among the able and interesting southern delegates\r\nLaura Clay and Josephine K. Henry, of Kentucky, and A. Viola Neblett and\r\nHelen Lewis Morris, of North Carolina, were especial favorites. After\r\nthe convention a mass meeting was held in the courthouse, which was\r\ncrowded with an enthusiastic audience. Mrs. M. L. McLendon, president of\r\nthe Atlanta Club, requested Miss Anthony to take charge. The\r\nConstitution said:\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony was received with such a warmth of demonstration on\r\n     the part of the large audience as to thoroughly convince her that\r\n     she was addressing those who were in sympathy with the suffrage\r\n     movement. As she stood up in the presence of the vast congregation\r\n     of faces a profound silence filled the hall and every one seemed to\r\n     be intently waiting for her opening words. Within the railing a\r\n     large number of men, who preferred to stand near the speaker rather\r\n     than secure seats in the rear of the hall, were grouped in a solid\r\n     mass, and appeared to be equally as much concerned as the ladies.\r\n\r\nThere were many distinguished women present at the convention, from the\r\nSouth and the North, and all separated with the feeling that fraternal\r\nbonds had been strengthened and many converts made to the belief in\r\nequal suffrage.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was much revered by the colored race and while here she\r\naddressed the students of the Atlanta University, and spoke with Bishop\r\nTurner to an immense audience at Bethel church. She was invited also to\r\naddress the alumnæ of the girls' high school. At the close of the\r\nconvention she went, with her sister Mary, niece Lucy, Anna Shaw and\r\nMrs. Upton, for a three days' visit at the spacious old-time mansion of\r\nthe Howards, in Columbus. She left for Aiken, S. C., February 9, where\r\nshe spoke in the courthouse and was introduced by the Baptist minister.\r\nHere she was the guest of Miss Martha Schofield, and was much interested\r\nin the very successful industrial school for colored children, founded\r\nby her during the war. On February 12, she lectured at Columbia for the\r\nPractical Progress Club, introduced by Colonel V. P. Clayton. The Pine\r\nTree State contained an excellent editorial in favor of woman suffrage,\r\nbut thought \"it could be more successfully advocated in that locality by\r\nsome one of less pronounced abolitionism.\" Her hostess, Mrs. Helen\r\nBrayton, gave a reception for her, and she met a large number of the\r\nrepresentative people of Columbia. Her last lecture was given at\r\nCulpepper, Va. The six weeks' southern trip had been very pleasant; she\r\nhad made many friends and found much sentiment in favor of suffrage. The\r\nonly drawback had been the severity of the weather, the coldest ever\r\nknown in that locality, which will long be remembered because of the\r\ndestruction of the orange groves.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony reached Washington on the morning of her seventy-fifth\r\nbirthday, February 15. The National Woman's Council was to open its\r\nsecond triennial meeting on the 18th, and its official board and many\r\ndelegates were already in the city. When she arrived she found that\r\n\"her girls,\" as she was fond of designating the younger workers, had\r\narranged for a banquet in her honor at the Ebbitt House that evening.\r\nCovers were laid for fifty and it was a beautiful affair. After a number\r\nof speeches had been made, Rachel Foster Avery arose and stated that the\r\nfriends of Miss Anthony from ocean to ocean and the lakes to the gulf,\r\nhad placed in her hands sums of money amounting to $5,000. This she had\r\nput into a trust fund, purchasing therewith an \"annuity\" of $800, which\r\nshe now took great pleasure in presenting. There were 202 contributors\r\nand although Mrs. Avery had been for several months collecting the\r\nmoney, incredible as it may seem, the whole matter was a complete\r\nsurprise to Miss Anthony. Realizing that during the last forty-five\r\nyears she had spent practically all she had earned and all that had been\r\ngiven her, to advance the cause to which she had devoted her life, they\r\ndetermined to put this testimonial into such shape as would make it\r\nimpossible thus to expend it. She was greatly overcome and for once\r\ncould not command the words to voice her feelings.\r\n\r\nAs each three months have rolled around since that occasion, and the\r\n$200 check has been sent with a pleasant greeting from the Penn Mutual\r\ninsurance company, hoping that she might live to use the entire\r\nprincipal, her heart has thrilled anew with gratitude and affection to\r\nMrs. Avery and the friends who put their love and appreciation into this\r\nmaterial shape. It suffices to pay the monthly expenses of the modest\r\nhousehold and, with the income from the few thousands that have been\r\nlaid away, an occasional paid lecture and the gifts from generous\r\nfriends, Miss Anthony is freed from financial anxiety, although obliged\r\nto exercise careful economy.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in this limited space to attempt a description of that\r\ngreat council extending through the days and evenings of two weeks,\r\nattended by delegates from twenty national organizations, representing\r\nthe highest intellects and activities among women and covering a wide\r\nrange of vital questions. Miss Anthony stood for the department of\r\nGovernment Reform. Although at this council she desired to be simply\r\none of the many representatives of different organizations, the public\r\nwould make her the central figure of all occasions. On February 28, Mrs.\r\nJohn R. McLean, assisted by Mrs. Calvin Brice, gave a reception in her\r\nhonor, attended by many of the official, literary, artistic and musical\r\npeople of the capital.\r\n\r\nFrederick Douglass came into the council the afternoon of the 20th and\r\nwas invited by the president, Mrs. Sewall, to a seat on the platform. He\r\naccepted, but declined to speak, acknowledging the applause only by a\r\nbow. Upon entering his home in Anacostia, a few hours later, he dropped\r\nto the floor and expired instantly. Funeral services were held in the\r\nAfrican Metropolitan church, Washington, February 25, in which, at the\r\nrequest of the family, Miss Anthony took part, paid a brief tribute and\r\nread Mrs. Stanton's touching memorial of the only man who sustained her\r\ndemand for the enfranchisement of women in that famous first convention\r\nof 1848.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the council Miss Anthony lectured at Lincoln, Va., in\r\nthe ancient Quaker meeting house. Returning to Washington she was\r\nentertained by Mrs. Mary S. Lockwood at a dinner party on the evening of\r\nthe Travel Club, at which she was one of the speakers. Reaching\r\nPhiladelphia March 9, she turned her steps, as was always her custom,\r\ndirectly towards her old friend Adeline Thomson, and her surprise and\r\ngrief may be imagined when she found that she had died a month previous.\r\nHer relations with Adeline and Annie Thomson, who had passed away nearly\r\nten years before, had been those of affectionate sisters, and for nearly\r\nforty years their home had been as her own. She had received many\r\ncontributions from them, and Adeline had made her a personal gift of\r\n$1,000. She often had said to her and written in her letters, that she\r\nhad $5,000 more laid away for her after she herself should have no\r\nfurther use for it, but as is so often the case she neglected to make\r\nprovision for this, and all her property went to a nephew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rachel Foster Avery (Signed: \"Always lovingly yours,\r\nRachel Foster Avery\")]\r\n\r\nFrom Mrs. Avery's suburban home at Somerton, Miss Anthony sent grateful\r\nletters to every one of the 202 contributors to her annuity. She\r\naddressed the 500 students at Drexel Institute, and left for New York\r\nMarch 12. Here she had an important business meeting with Mary Lowe\r\nDickinson, the newly elected president of the National Council, and then\r\nwent to tell all about the Atlanta convention, the Woman's Council and\r\nvarious other events to Mrs. Stanton, who still felt the liveliest\r\ninterest although not physically able to take an active part.\r\n\r\nThe day after Miss Anthony reached home she read in the morning paper\r\nthat two of the State Industrial School girls and two of the free\r\nacademy boys had been seen the night before coming out of a questionable\r\nplace; the girls were arrested and locked up in the station house, the\r\nboys were told to go home. It was an everyday injustice but she\r\ndetermined to protest, so she went straightway to the police court,\r\nwhere she insisted that the boys should not go free while the girls were\r\npunished. She pleaded in vain; the girls were sent to the reformatory,\r\nthe boys being used as witnesses against them and then dismissed without\r\nso much as a reprimand.\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards Miss Anthony went to the Baptist church one\r\nSunday evening to hear a young colored woman, Miss Ida Wells, lecture on\r\nthe lynching of negroes in the South. The speaker was rudely interrupted\r\nseveral times by a fellow from Texas who was in Rochester attending the\r\ntheological school. She answered him politely but at length he asked:\r\n\"If the negroes don't like it in the South, why don't they leave and go\r\nNorth?\" At this Miss Anthony, who had been growing more indignant every\r\nmoment, sprung to her feet and, with flashing eyes and ringing voice,\r\nsaid: \"I will tell you why; it is because they are treated no better in\r\nthe North than they are in the South.\" She then related a number of\r\ninstances, which had come to her own knowledge, of the cruel\r\ndiscrimination made against colored people, to the utter amazement of\r\nthe audience who did not believe such things possible.[111]\r\n\r\nShe took Miss Wells home with her for the rest of her stay. She had\r\nemployed a young woman stenographer for a few weeks to clear up her\r\naccumulated correspondence and, having to go away the next day, she told\r\nMiss Wells the girl might help her with her pile of letters. When she\r\nreturned in the evening she found her scribbling away industriously and\r\nthe stenographer at leisure. In answer to her inquiry the latter\r\nreplied: \"I don't choose to write for a colored person.\" \"If you can not\r\noblige me by assisting a guest in my house,\" said Miss Anthony, \"you can\r\nnot remain in my employ.\" The girl, although in destitute circumstances,\r\ngave up her situation.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony had been feeling for a long time that, in justice to\r\nherself and to the State Industrial School, she should resign her\r\nposition on the board of managers. When she accepted it she had intended\r\nto give up the greater part of her travelling and direct her forces from\r\nthe seat of government in her own home, but she had found this\r\npractically impossible. The demands for her actual presence and personal\r\nwork were too strong to be resisted. There were very few women in the\r\ncountry who could draw so large an audience as herself, or who knew so\r\nwell how to manage a convention or carry on a campaign, and the women of\r\nthe different States, who had one or the other of these in hand, were\r\nunwilling to accept a substitute. She was as well and vigorous as at\r\nfifty, and there seemed to be no adequate reason why she should refuse\r\nthe many opportunities to advance the cause for which she had given the\r\nactive service of nearly half a century. The several years since she\r\nbegan housekeeping, therefore, had found her at home no more of the time\r\nthan those which had preceded.\r\n\r\nWhen she first visited the school she found the boys' departments fitted\r\nup with all the appliances of a steam laundry, while a large number of\r\nthe girls were bending their backs over washtubs and ironing-boards the\r\nwhole of every week. She soon succeeded in having the washing sent over\r\nto the laundry, where a few girls were able to do it all in two or three\r\ndays; she also made many valuable suggestions in the sewing department.\r\nWhen in the city she went to the school on Sunday, helped with the\r\nservices and talked to the 700 boys and 150 girls. Some of the latter\r\ncame to her one Sunday and said pathetically that it was the first time\r\na speaker ever had seemed to know there were any girls there! She wrote\r\nin her journal, with quiet humor, that the men on the board were going\r\nthe next day to select a cooking stove. She realized even more strongly\r\nthan ever that, though the best and wisest men may be on the boards of\r\npublic institutions, there is need also of women, but she felt that,\r\nwith so vast an amount of other work on hand, she could not do her duty\r\nby the school. As she was about to go away again for a number of months\r\nshe decided to delay her resignation no longer and forwarded it to\r\nGovernor Morton April 15, after having served about two and a half\r\nyears. She then finished her lecture engagements and completed\r\narrangements for what proved to be one of the pleasantest journeys of\r\nher life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[107] At these annual feasts gentlemen are permitted to sit in the\r\ngallery, listen to the toasts and watch the ladies enjoy the dinner.\r\n\r\n[108] During this year Mrs. Gross had presented Miss Anthony with $1,000\r\nto complete the education of a nephew and niece.\r\n\r\n[109] A plan for a great Liberal Religious Congress, the outgrowth of\r\nthe Parliament of Religions in 1893.\r\n\r\n[110] After 1892 Miss Anthony had to read most of Mrs. Stanton's\r\naddresses, and the latter wrote her: \"If you pronounce what I write\r\n'good,' I know it is up to the mark. Many thanks for reading all my\r\npapers so well as everybody says you do. I am sure of your rich voice\r\nand deep sympathy with the subject, and I much prefer to have you read\r\nmy speeches rather than any other person, as I am always told that your\r\nreading makes a deep impression. Our thoughts have the same trend on the\r\nwoman suffrage question, and we have written and talked over every phase\r\nof the subject so much together that what I write is essentially yours\r\nas well as mine.\"\r\n\r\n[111] The Rochester dailies came out next morning with full reports of\r\nthis episode and editorial remarks; citizens of both sexes wrote to the\r\npapers, pro and con; other newspapers took up the question, and a wave\r\nof comment swept over the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND VISIT TO CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\n1895.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said in another chapter that Miss Anthony established\r\nherself firmly and forever in the hearts of the people at the Columbian\r\nExposition of 1893. Men and women were there from every State in the\r\nUnion, many of whom never had seen or heard her and had been deeply\r\nprejudiced against her, but she conquered all and they returned home\r\nhenceforth to sing her praises. Naturally they wanted their friends and\r\nneighbors to be converted like themselves, and invitations to lecture\r\ncame from all quarters. One of the most urgent was from the Woman's\r\nCongress Auxiliary of the great California Midwinter Exposition, which\r\nfollowed the World's Fair, but as she had two campaigns on hand in 1894\r\nshe could not accept it. Out of this auxiliary had grown a permanent\r\nWoman's Congress Association, with Sarah B. Cooper at its head. When a\r\npressing request came to attend their first anniversary in San\r\nFrancisco, in 1895, she accepted with pleasure. The corresponding\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Minna V. Gaden, wrote in reply:\r\n\r\n     I can not attempt to express to you the joy and gratification of\r\n     the executive board over your consent to be with us and take part\r\n     in the congress in May. I wish I could have phonographed the\r\n     exclamations of delight and photographed the beaming countenances\r\n     of the members when I read them your letter. In answer to your\r\n     question as to whether we desired to have you speak upon some\r\n     special point of the subject for which you stand, I would say we\r\n     want Susan B. Anthony and all that she is; and we are sure that\r\n     the right word will be said, the great facts made plain and the\r\n     true inspiration given. We want _you_ and all that your presence\r\n     means and all that your life's work has brought.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony had another reason for wishing to go to California in\r\naddition to the desire of meeting and helping the women of that\r\nbeautiful State in their congress. Its legislature, the previous winter,\r\nhad submitted a woman suffrage amendment which was to be voted on in\r\n1896. This visit would enable her to look over the field, talk with the\r\nmen and women, and render any assistance they might desire towards\r\nplanning their campaign. She wrote Mrs. Cooper stating that she did not\r\nwish to make the journey alone, that she liked to have one of her\r\n\"lieutenants\" to relieve her of the burden of much speaking, and would\r\nbe glad of the privilege of bringing with her Rev. Anna Shaw. Mrs.\r\nCooper responded with a check of $450, for travelling expenses, saying:\r\n\"We rejoice to know that Miss Shaw will come with you, as another grand\r\nhelper for us. I send you the money and want you to have every possible\r\ncomfort on the journey.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that time until Miss Anthony reached California not over three days\r\never passed without a letter from Mrs. Cooper, rejoicing over the\r\npromised visit. \"Everybody is full of expectancy looking for your\r\nadvent. I have engaged the First Congregational church of San Francisco\r\nfor Miss Shaw's sermon. Hattie and I send you a heart full of love. May\r\nGod hold you safe in His keeping.\" \"San Francisco and the whole Pacific\r\ncoast have a warm welcome for you both; every one is looking forward to\r\nmeeting you, great and noble champion of all that is good.\" So the\r\nletters ran, and they were supplemented by long and loving ones from the\r\ndaughter Harriet, who lived but to second her mother's work and wishes.\r\n\r\nWhen the papers heralded abroad the news that Miss Anthony was going to\r\nCalifornia, the large western towns along the route sent earnest\r\nrequests for lectures and visits, and the journey assumed the aspect of\r\na triumphal tour. She started April 27, full of health and spirit and\r\nwith happy anticipations; spent one day with Mrs. Upton, at Warren, O.,\r\none with Mrs. Sewall, at Indianapolis, going thence to Chicago, where\r\nshe was entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Gross. Here she found Harriet\r\nHosmer, who had been with them seven months, while she worked on her\r\nstatue of Lincoln. In the evening half a dozen reporters called and the\r\npapers bristled with interviews. The next day she went with her hostess\r\nto the famous Woman's Club. Miss Shaw joined Miss Anthony in Chicago,\r\nand May 1 they left for St. Louis, where they remained four days at the\r\nNew Planters' Hotel, the guests of Mrs. Gross, who had accompanied them.\r\n\r\nTheir mission at St. Louis was to address the Mississippi Valley Woman's\r\nCongress, under the auspices of the W. C. T. U., Mrs. E. B. Ingalls,\r\npresiding. Miss Anthony spoke on \"The Present Outlook,\" and the papers\r\ndescribed enthusiastically \"the splendid ovation\" she received, the many\r\nfloral offerings, and the hundreds of personal greetings at the close of\r\nthe evening. Just before her address, seventy-five little boys and\r\ngirls, several colored ones among them, marched past her on the\r\nplatform, each laying a rose in her lap. The day after the congress the\r\nState Suffrage Association held its convention, and on the evening of\r\nMay 4 a handsome banquet, with covers laid for 200, was given for her at\r\nthe Mercantile Club rooms.\r\n\r\nShe reached Denver May 8, at 4 A. M., remained in the sleeper till six\r\nand then could stand it no longer but took a carriage and sallied forth.\r\nWhen the reception committee came to the station at seven to escort her\r\nto the elaborate breakfast which had been prepared at the Brown Palace\r\nHotel, where a large number of friends were waiting, the guest had flown\r\nand could not be found. While in the city she was entertained at the\r\nhome of Hon. Thomas M. Patterson, of the Rocky Mountain News, whose\r\nprogressive and cultured wife was her warm personal friend and had been\r\nan advocate of suffrage long before it was granted to the women of\r\nColorado. Reverend Anna was the guest of ex-Governor and Mrs. Routt.\r\nThat afternoon Miss Anthony went to Boulder, where she was engaged to\r\nlecture.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Woman's Club gave a large reception in their honor at\r\nthe Brown Palace Hotel, attended by over 1,200 women. The News, in its\r\naccount, said: \"The scene marked, to the retrospective mind, the\r\nenormous change that has taken place in the status of the sex within the\r\nlifetime of one woman. It hardly seemed possible, as the spectator\r\nbeheld Miss Anthony surrounded by the richest and most conservative\r\nwomen of Denver, to believe that in her youth the great lecturer was\r\nhissed from the stage in the most cultured and liberal cities of the\r\nUnited States, and cast out from polite society like a pariah. It is not\r\noften either that one who has been a pioneer in an unpopular cause lives\r\nto see it become fashionable and herself the center of attention from a\r\nyounger generation which has profited by her labors of earlier years.\"\r\nThe same paper commented editorially: \"To accomplish the political\r\nenfranchisement of her sex and open a broader field of work and\r\ninfluence for women everywhere, Miss Anthony has devoted her life....\r\nAmong all the noble women who have stood boldly to champion the cause of\r\ntheir sisters, she is easily chief, and is worthy of all the honors that\r\nhave been bestowed upon her. It must have been a proud satisfaction for\r\nher yesterday to meet the women of Colorado, who are now endowed with\r\nequal political rights because of the crusade she has been instrumental\r\nin starting and maintaining. Well may these newly enfranchised women do\r\nher reverence. Not more loyal should the silver men of Colorado be to\r\nDick Bland, than the women of Colorado to the apostle of equal\r\nsuffrage--Susan B. Anthony.\"\r\n\r\nThe Denver Times said in a leading editorial: \"To Miss Anthony the women\r\nof today owe a great debt, for through her life's work they enjoy a\r\nhundred privileges denied them fifty years ago. From her devotion to a\r\ncause which for decades made her a martyr to the derision of an\r\nunsympathetic public, has grown a new order of things. Her hand has most\r\nhelped to open every profession and every line of business to women.\r\nWhile all the women of the United States are under many obligations to\r\nher, those of Colorado, who are now equal citizens, owe her the\r\ngreatest allegiance.\" The Times also quotes in an interview with Miss\r\nAnthony: \"When asked what subject she would take for her speeches to the\r\npeople of Colorado, she shook her head with a kindly smile and said: 'My\r\nusual lectures will not do. What can I say to the women who have the\r\nfranchise? I can only encourage them to use their new power wisely, to\r\nstand bravely for the right, and to help the equal suffrage cause in\r\nother States.'\"\r\n\r\nThe ladies lectured that evening to an immense audience in the Broadway\r\nTheater. The papers reported with great headlines: \"Enthusiastic\r\nGreeting by Colorado's Enfranchised Citizens. Miss Anthony Overcome with\r\nHearty Congratulations. America's Joan of Arc Shakes Hands with an Army\r\nof Women Voters.\" One searches in vain in these newspapers for evidences\r\nof the terrible loss of respect which women were to experience when they\r\nwere endowed with the ballot. The News, in over a column report, said:\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony's voice was clear and powerful, filling the big\r\n     theater without any apparent effort. She began by saying that she\r\n     believed the thing she had always claimed had come true; that the\r\n     women had learned a new and higher self-respect with their added\r\n     rights and responsibilities.... She paid the men of Colorado the\r\n     compliment of declaring them the best in the world. The men of\r\n     Wyoming had occupied this proud position up to 1893, but those of\r\n     Colorado had granted the ballot to a disfranchised class not\r\n     through the legislature, but by a popular vote. This act stands\r\n     alone in the history of the world; no class of men has ever done as\r\n     much for even another class of men....\r\n\r\n     She said she had heard that some of the women had voted with\r\n     sagacity and some had not. This was not strange, since men\r\n     continued to do this after more than one hundred years of voting.\r\n     If women made mistakes this year, they would remedy them next year,\r\n     and in time she believed they would become the balance of power\r\n     between the two parties in all social, moral and educational\r\n     questions.\r\n\r\nAt Cheyenne Senator and Mrs. Carey gave an elegant dinner party in their\r\nhonor, attended by Governor and Mrs. Rich, Senator and Mrs. Warren, Mrs.\r\nEsther Morris, the first woman judge, Mrs. Therese Jenkins, State\r\npresident, Mrs. Amalia Post, a suffrage pioneer, and other distinguished\r\nguests. They went immediately from dinner to the new Baptist church,\r\nwhich was filled to overflowing, and were introduced by the governor. At\r\nthe close of the lectures, Mrs. Jenkins said, \"Now I desire to introduce\r\nthe audience to the speakers.\" She then called the names of the governor\r\nand all his staff, the attorney-general, the United States judges, the\r\nsenators and congressmen, the mayor and members of the city council.\r\nEach rose as his name was mentioned, and before she was through, it\r\nseemed as if half the audience were on their feet, and the applause was\r\nmost enthusiastic. Here again one could not discern an indication of the\r\ndreadful loss of respect which was to be the portion of enfranchised\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIt was long after midnight before the travellers were quietly in bed in\r\nthe delightful home of the Careys, but at half-past seven they had\r\nfinished breakfast and were on board train en route for Salt Lake City.\r\nLearning from the conductor that Mrs. Leland Stanford's private car was\r\nattached, Miss Anthony sent her card and soon was invited to a seat in\r\nthat luxurious conveyance, where she enjoyed a visit of several hours.\r\nMrs. Stanford told her of the government suit against the estate, and\r\nMiss Anthony's parting words were a warning not to leave her lawyers to\r\ngo before the Supreme Court alone, but to be present herself in\r\nWashington to protect her own interests and those of the great\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nAt Salt Lake, on Sunday morning, a large delegation of women,\r\nrepresenting the different religious sects and political organizations,\r\nmet the travellers and drove to the Templeton, where seventy-five sat\r\ndown to breakfast, and they were then taken for a drive over the city.\r\nMiss Anthony was the guest of Mrs. Beatie, daughter of Brigham and Zina\r\nD. H. Young, and Miss Shaw of Mrs. McVicker. At 3 P. M., the Reverend\r\nAnna preached in the great Tabernacle, Bishops Whitney and Richards\r\nassisting. At the close they congratulated her on having preached a\r\nMormon sermon; afterwards a Methodist minister who was in the audience\r\nthanked her for her good Methodist sermon; and a little later a\r\nPresbyterian minister shook her hand heartily and expressed his pleasure\r\nat hearing her Presbyterian doctrine; so she concluded she had made a\r\npolitic address. Sunday evening she preached in the theater at what was\r\nintended to be a union service. All of the Gentile ministers had been\r\ninvited to take part and all declined but the pastor of the Unitarian\r\nchurch. He and the principal of the public schools, formerly a Unitarian\r\nminister, were the only men on the stage.\r\n\r\nThe Inter-Mountain Woman Suffrage Association of Utah, Montana and Idaho\r\nopened the next morning, May 13. The first day's sessions were held in\r\nthe new city building, but it was so crowded that an overflow meeting\r\nwas necessary and the next day the convention was transferred to the big\r\nassembly hall. The seat of honor was given to Miss Anthony; on her right\r\nMrs. Emmeline B. Wells, president of the Utah association, on her left,\r\nRev. Anna Shaw. They were surrounded by a semicircle of the illustrious\r\nwomen of the Territory who, for many years, had been active in the work\r\nfor suffrage. The hall was draped with the national colors and above the\r\nstage were portraits of Lincoln, Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton. The\r\nintroductory address was made by Governor West, who, after paying an\r\nearnest tribute to Miss Anthony, predicted that the new State\r\nconstitution, which was to go to the voters containing a woman suffrage\r\nclause, would be overwhelmingly ratified.\r\n\r\nDuring their stay in Salt Lake Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw received the\r\nhighest consideration. Monday afternoon Mr. and Mrs. F. S. Richards gave\r\na reception in their honor, and were assisted in receiving by Governor\r\nWest, President Woodruff, Hon. George Q. Cannon, and many ladies. The\r\nnext afternoon a reception was tendered by the W. C. T. U. In the\r\nevening, a large party went to Ogden, where a banquet was given, a great\r\nmeeting held in the city hall, and an overflow meeting in one of the\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nThe 16th of May found the travellers at Reno, Nev., where they were the\r\nguests of Mrs. Elda A. Orr, president of the State association. In the\r\nmorning Miss Anthony talked to the 800 men and women students of the\r\nState University. In the evening they spoke in the opera house, which\r\nwas crowded to its limits, while on the stage were the representative\r\nmen and women of the city and neighboring towns. The house was\r\nbeautifully decorated with flowers and banners, a brass band played on\r\nthe balcony and an orchestra within. They were introduced by Miss Hannah\r\nH. Clapp, who had presented Miss Anthony to a Nevada audience at Carson,\r\nin 1871. Saturday afternoon they enjoyed a charming reception in the\r\nparlors of the women's clubhouse.\r\n\r\nLate that day they resumed their journey, took supper at Truckee on the\r\nsummit of the Sierras, and had a delicious glimpse of Lake Donner just\r\nas they plunged into the forty miles of snow-sheds. They were glad of a\r\nlong night's rest after the strain of the last three weeks and, when\r\nthey awoke the next morning, were rolling through the fertile Sacramento\r\nvalley. California in May! Never was there a pen inspired with the power\r\nto describe its beauties. Not the brush of the most gifted artist could\r\npicture the mountains with their green foot-hills and snow-capped\r\nsummits; the valleys, nature's own lovely and fragrant conservatories of\r\nbrilliant blossoms and luxuriant, riotous vines, and the great oaks with\r\ntheir glossy foliage, all enveloped in a warm and shimmering atmosphere\r\nand, bending above, the soft blue sky scarcely dimmed by a fleeting\r\ncloud. They can not be put into words, they must be lived.\r\n\r\nThe travellers had been up and dressed and enjoying the sweet air and\r\nlovely landscape for a long time when the train stopped at the Oakland\r\nstation at half-past seven Sunday morning, May 19. Early as was the\r\nhour, with the mists still hovering over the bay, they found awaiting\r\nthem, laden with flowers, Mrs. Cooper and her daughter Harriet, from San\r\nFrancisco, Mrs. Isabel A. Baldwin, Mrs. Ada Van Pelt and several other\r\nOakland ladies, and Rev. John K. McLean, the Congregational minister,\r\nwhose eldest brother was the husband of Miss Anthony's sister. He\r\nconveyed her at once to his own home, while the others took charge of\r\nMiss Shaw. At 11 o'clock the reverend lady was in Dr. McLean's pulpit,\r\nfresh and smiling, in her soft, black ministerial robes, with dainty\r\nwhite lawn at neck and wrists. Every seat was filled, chairs were\r\nplaced in the aisles, people sitting on the steps, and the happiest\r\nwoman in all the throng was Susan B. Anthony as she sat beside her\r\nfriend. That evening the scene was repeated in the Congregational church\r\nof San Francisco, where the chancel was adorned with lilies and the\r\nrevered Sarah B. Cooper made the opening prayer.\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Congress opened at Golden Gate Hall, on the morning of May\r\n20. The newspapers of San Francisco had decreed that this congress\r\nshould be a success, and to this end they had been as generous with\r\nspace and as complimentary in tone as the most exacting could have\r\ndesired. The result was that at not a session during the week was the\r\ngreat hall large enough to hold the audience which sought admission. It\r\npresented a beautiful sight on the opening morning, festooned from end\r\nto end with banners; the stage a veritable conservatory, with a\r\nbackground of palms, bamboo and other tropical plants, and in front a\r\nbewildering array of lilies, roses, carnations, sweet peas and other\r\nfragrant blossoms. Grouped upon the platform, on chairs and divans,\r\nunder tall, shaded lamps, were the speakers and guests. At the right of\r\nthe president's desk was a large arm-chair artistically draped with\r\nflowers beneath a canopy of La France roses. At half-past ten Mrs.\r\nCooper stepped out from the wings escorting Miss Anthony, followed by\r\nMayor Adolph Sutro and Rev. Anna Shaw. The audience burst into a storm\r\nof applause and, amid cheers and the waving of handkerchiefs, Miss\r\nAnthony was conducted to her floral throne. As soon as she was seated,\r\none woman after another came up with arms full of flowers until she was\r\nliterally buried under an avalanche of the choicest blossoms. No one who\r\nwas present ever will forget the lovely scene.\r\n\r\nMayor Sutro made the address of welcome, in which he emphasized his\r\nbelief that \"the ballot should be placed in the hands of woman as the\r\nmost powerful agent for the uplifting of humanity.\" At the preceding\r\ncongress the general topic had been, \"The Relation of Women to the\r\nAffairs of the World,\" and the criticism had been made that it was too\r\nmuch of a woman suffrage meeting. For this one the subject selected was\r\n\"The Home,\" but the results were the same. Whatever the\r\npaper--\"Hereditary Influence,\" \"The Parents' Power,\" \"The Family and the\r\nState\"--all led to suffrage; and the more suffrage, the greater the\r\napplause from the audience. Mrs. Cooper had written Miss Anthony, \"I\r\ntold the committee to put you and Miss Shaw anywhere on the program,\r\nthat you could speak on one subject as well as another;\" so they found\r\nthemselves down for \"Educational Influences of Home Life;\" \"Which Counts\r\nMore, Father's or Mother's Influence?\" \"Does Wifehood Preclude\r\nCitizenship?\" \"The Evolution of the Home;\" \"The Family and the State;\"\r\n\"Shall We Co-operate?\" \"The Rights of Motherhood;\" and numerous other\r\ntopics. Both spoke every day during the Congress and the people seemed\r\nnever to tire of hearing them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cooper presided in her dignified and beautiful manner, and in her\r\npresentation said: \"I have the very great honor and pleasure of\r\nintroducing to this assembly one who has done more towards lifting up\r\nwomen than any other one person--Miss Susan B. Anthony.\" The Chronicle\r\nreported: \"Then the audience made still further demonstrations. They\r\nclapped and cheered and waved, and some of the gray-haired women wiped\r\ntheir eyes because it is so seldom that people live to be appreciated.\r\nBut Susan B. stood like a princess of the blood royal. Very erect of\r\nhead and clear of voice she began her little speech. It was full of\r\nreminiscences, but some few people have the privilege of telling\r\nrecollections without the fear of ever boring any one. Miss Anthony is\r\none of these....\"\r\n\r\nMiss Shaw also received a hearty welcome; and all through that wonderful\r\nweek the bright, appreciative, warm-hearted California audiences crowded\r\nthe hall and listened and applauded and brought their offerings of\r\nflowers and fruit to lay at the feet of these two women, who had come\r\nfrom the far East to clasp their hands and unite with them in one great\r\ncause--the uplifting of womanhood. The Chronicle said:\r\n\r\n     Twelve hundred women went to Golden Gate Hall on Monday; fourteen\r\n     hundred went Tuesday; two thousand Wednesday; twenty-five\r\n     hundred Thursday. Golden Gate Hall could not hold one-fourth of\r\n     the crowds, so all three of yesterday's sessions were held at the\r\n     First Congregational church. Even there a stream of humanity\r\n     blocked every aisle clear to the platform. Nobody ever supposed\r\n     that the women of San Francisco cared for aught except their gowns,\r\n     their teas and their babies. But they do. They like brains, even in\r\n     their own sex. And they can applaud good speeches even if made by\r\n     women, and they have all fallen madly, desperately in love with a\r\n     very short, very plump little woman whose name is Anna Shaw. A year\r\n     ago there were not more than a hundred women in San Francisco who\r\n     could have been dragged to a suffrage meeting, but yesterday\r\n     twenty-five times that number struggled and tore their clothing in\r\n     their determination to hear Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sarah B. Cooper (Signed: \"Always Affectionately Yours,\r\nSarah B Cooper\")]\r\n\r\nAgain it commented: \"There has been some talk that the Woman's Congress\r\nwhich expired last night attracted its crowds under false\r\npretenses--that it promised to talk about the home and then preached\r\nsuffrage. That is usually the case when Miss Anthony is about, but it\r\nwas always suffrage in its relation to the home. Who, knowing Miss\r\nAnthony's reputation, could suppose that she would cross the continent\r\nin the evening of her life to discuss the draping of a lace curtain or\r\nthe best colors for a parlor carpet?... Five thousand people waiting on\r\nthe steps of the Temple Emanu-El for the purpose of hearing the woman\r\npreacher's last address does not look as if her position were uncertain.\r\nMere curiosity does not take the same people to nineteen consecutive\r\nsessions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Apotheosis of Woman,\" the Examiner headed its fine reports; and the\r\nCall, the Bulletin, the Post, the Report, and the newspapers around the\r\nbay all gave columns of space to this great meeting which had discovered\r\nto the State of California its own remarkable women.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony had been the guest of her old friend, Mrs. A. A. Sargent,\r\nwhose hospitality she had enjoyed so many years in Washington City. As\r\nthe suffrage amendment was to come up the next year, Miss Anthony and\r\nMiss Shaw met with a large number of ladies at the Congregational church\r\nand helped them organize a campaign committee, with Mrs. Cooper as its\r\nchairman. In accepting the office she said: \"I intend to put all there\r\nis of me into current coin and use it to forward this Heaven-ordained\r\nwork. If ever a woman was thoroughly converted to this idea I have\r\nbeen, and in this spirit I accept the charge.\"\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of this same day Mrs. Cooper escorted them to the Y. M.\r\nC. A. Hall to address the Congregational ministers at their regular\r\nMonday meeting, to which they had been officially invited. That evening\r\nthey were the guests of honor at the Unitarian Club dinner at the Palace\r\nHotel, Miss Anthony responding to the toast, \"The Rights and Privileges\r\nof Man;\" Miss Shaw to \"The Manly Man;\" Rev. A. C. Hirst and Dr. Horatio\r\nStebbins to \"The Rights and Privileges of Woman\" and \"The Womanly\r\nWoman;\" and the evening was a lively one. They addressed the girls' high\r\nschool, and accepted also an invitation to speak to the 900 teachers at\r\nthe institute in session at Golden Gate Hall. They were the guests of\r\nthe Century Club, Sorosis and other San Francisco societies of women.\r\n\r\nA friend, Mrs. Mary Grafton Campbell, wrote from Palo Alto that she\r\nheard President Jordan say every remaining day and evening of the\r\nsemester were filled, and when she exclaimed, \"But Miss Anthony is\r\ncoming; what about her?\" he replied, \"There will be room for Miss\r\nAnthony if we have to give up classes.\" Immediately he wrote her a\r\ncordial invitation to visit the university, offering to pay her\r\ntravelling expenses and expressing a wish to entertain her in his home.\r\nShe accepted for herself and Miss Shaw, and they spoke to as many\r\nstudents as could crowd into the chapel. Mrs. Stanford sent a personal\r\ninvitation for them to attend the reception which she was to give the\r\nfirst graduating class in her San Francisco residence.[112] They were\r\ninvited to the beautiful Water Carnival at Santa Cruz, and to the Flower\r\nFestival at Santa Barbara. It would be impossible, indeed, to mention\r\nall the delightful invitations of both a public and private nature, and\r\nthere was not a day that did not bring a remembrance in the shape of\r\nflowers and the delicious fruit in which Miss Anthony revelled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours with friendly greetings, Jane L.\r\nStanford\"]\r\n\r\nOn May 29 the Ebell Club of Oakland gave them a breakfast at 11:30; at 2\r\nP. M. they addressed the Alameda County Auxiliary of the Woman's\r\nCongress, Rev. Eliza Tupper Wilkes, president. The audience filled every\r\ninch of space in the Unitarian church, the most prominent ladies of\r\nOakland occupied seats on the platform, and a large reception in the\r\nparlors followed the speaking. The evening session was held in the\r\nCongregational church, an enthusiastic crowd in attendance. The next\r\nafternoon they started for the Yosemite Valley, having for companions\r\nDr. Elizabeth Sargent and Dr. Henry A. Baker, Miss Anthony's\r\ngrand-nephew. There Miss Anthony, at the age of seventy-five, made the\r\nusual trips on the back of a mule. She relates that the name of her\r\nsteed was Moses and Anna Shaw's Ephraim, and they had great sport over\r\nthem. They enjoyed to the full all the beauties of that wonderful\r\nregion, which never pall, no matter how often one visits them or how\r\nlong one remains among them. During this trip Miss Shaw went with one of\r\nthe Yosemite commissioners, George B. Sperry, to the Mariposa Big Trees.\r\nTwo, in a group of the largest three, were christened George Washington\r\nand Abraham Lincoln, and he offered her the privilege of naming the\r\nthird. She gave it the title of Susan B. Anthony, it was appropriately\r\nmarked, and thus it will be known to future generations.\r\n\r\nAt San Jose they were the guests of Mrs. Sarah Knox Goodrich, who gave a\r\ndinner for them, and over a hundred called during the evening. Sunday\r\nafternoon Miss Anthony spoke in the Unitarian church, and Monday morning\r\naddressed the students of the Normal School. At noon Mrs. Elizabeth Lowe\r\nWatson gave a luncheon party under the great trees at her lovely home,\r\nSunny Brae, where the ladies spoke in the afternoon to several hundred\r\npeople from neighboring ranches. In the evening they lectured at San\r\nJose and, although fifty cents admission was charged, not nearly all who\r\nhad bought tickets could get into the building. When they left for Los\r\nAngeles Mrs. Goodrich slipped into the hand of each $50 in gold, as a\r\npresent; just as Mrs. Sargent had done when they left San Francisco.\r\n\r\nLong before Miss Anthony had started for California, cordial invitations\r\nhad been received from the southern part of the State, from old friends\r\nand new. It was of course impossible to accept more than a small\r\nfraction of these, but from the time the twain reached Los Angeles,\r\nthere was one continuous ovation. On the evening of their arrival, June\r\n12, they addressed an audience of over 2,000 in Simpson tabernacle,\r\nwhich had been transformed into a bower of choicest blossoms. While in\r\nthe city they were the guests of Mrs. Caroline M. Severance, with whom\r\nMiss Anthony had worked for suffrage in Ohio forty years before.\r\n\r\nIn Riverside a reception was given them at the Glenwood by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nF. M. Richardson, relatives of Miss Anthony. The beautiful drives for\r\nwhich that place is famous were greatly enjoyed, and they went into\r\nraptures over the oranges, which they never before had seen in such\r\nquantities. They spoke to a large audience in the handsomely decorated\r\nMethodist tabernacle at Pasadena. While here they were the guests of\r\nMrs. P. C. Baker, on Orange Avenue, and received many social attentions\r\nfrom the people of this lovely little city. Thence they went to Pomona,\r\nwhere they were met at the station by a delegation of ladies, escorted\r\nto the Palomares Hotel, and found the committee had adorned their rooms\r\nwith flowers in a profusion which would be impossible outside of\r\nCalifornia. They spoke here also in the Methodist church. The next day\r\nMiss Shaw preached in Los Angeles and Miss Anthony spent the Sunday at\r\nWhittier with Mrs. Harriet R. Strong at her ranche, so widely noted for\r\nits walnut groves and pampas fields.\r\n\r\nMonday morning they journeyed to San Diego where they were the guests of\r\nMiss Anthony's niece, Mrs. George L. Baker. Elaborate preparations had\r\nbeen made to receive them and they addressed a large audience in the\r\nevening. The next afternoon a reception was given at the Hotel Florence\r\nby all the woman's clubs of the city. The Union said: \"The two guests of\r\nhonor were simply loaded and garlanded with flowers. They were presented\r\nwith baskets of sweet peas by the Y. W. C. A., yellow blossoms by the\r\nsuffrage club, red, white and blue by the Datus Coon corps; bouquets of\r\nwhite roses by the W. C. T. U., of red and white carnations in a holder\r\nof blue satin by Heintzelman W. R. C., of red roses by the Woman's\r\nLeague, of pink roses by the Jewish women. There was music by an\r\norchestra as an accompaniment to the sociability of the occasion, in\r\nwhich some 700 women participated during the afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThe following day a picnic was given by the Woman's Club at \"Olivewood,\"\r\nthe home of Mrs. Flora M. Kimball, near National City, where tables were\r\nspread on the lawn for the 200 guests who came by train and carriage.\r\nThat same evening, by request of many who could not be present at the\r\nfirst meeting, the two ladies lectured again in San Diego. The next day\r\nthey returned to Los Angeles, laden with souvenirs of their delightful\r\nvisit; and that evening, without an hour's rest, addressed a mass\r\nmeeting there.\r\n\r\nThe following day the Los Angeles Herald gave an excursion to Santa\r\nMonica in their honor. The ladies of that pretty seaside resort, under\r\nthe leadership of Mrs. C. H. Ivens, met them with carriages and\r\nconducted them to the Hotel Arcadia. After luncheon, as they started for\r\nthe hall where they were to speak, twelve little girls strewed flowers\r\nin their pathway, and after the addresses twelve large bouquets of\r\nchoice blossoms were laid at their feet. They were taken for a long\r\ndrive by Mrs. E. J. Gorham, then to the residence of her brother,\r\nSenator John P. Jones; and at the close of a lovely day, returned to Los\r\nAngeles. That evening a reception was given them by Mrs. Mark Sibley\r\nSeverance, which Miss Anthony always remembered as one of the handsomest\r\nin her long experience. The next morning they met a committee from the\r\nsuffrage club and had a conference on the broad piazza of their hostess\r\nin regard to the work of the coming campaign; and in the afternoon took\r\nthe train for San Francisco, after two of the most delightful weeks in\r\nall their recollection. An especially gratifying feature was the\r\nattitude of the press of Southern California. There had been scarcely a\r\ndiscordant note in the extended reports of the public meetings and\r\nsocial entertainments, and the editorial comments on the two ladies and\r\nthe cause of which they were leading representatives, were dignified,\r\nfair and friendly.[113]\r\n\r\nThey reached San Francisco June 24 and were welcomed at the ferry by a\r\nnumber of friends from the two cities. The next day they were\r\nentertained at an elaborate dinner-party of ladies and gentlemen in the\r\nartistic home of Mrs. Emma Shafter Howard, of Oakland. From the table\r\nthey went at once to the evening meeting. The Enquirer said: \"It needed\r\nno preliminary brass band or blare of trumpets to pack the\r\nCongregational church with a live Oakland audience. The simple\r\nannouncement that Susan B. Anthony and Rev. Anna H. Shaw were to speak\r\nwas sufficient, and the chairman, Colonel John P. Irish, looked out over\r\nan animated sea of faces.\"\r\n\r\nThe following evening the San Francisco farewell meeting was held in\r\nMetropolitan Temple. Friday and Saturday were filled with social\r\nengagements, sight-seeing and shopping. On Sunday Miss Shaw preached in\r\nthe California street Methodist church in the morning and the Second\r\nCongregational in the evening, while Miss Anthony addressed a union\r\nmeeting of all the colored congregations in the city at the M. E. Zion\r\nchurch, the historic building in which Starr King preached before the\r\nwar. Monday they spoke again at the Ministers' Meeting. The fact that\r\nthey would be present had been announced in the papers, and ministers of\r\nall denominations were there from most of the towns within a radius of\r\nforty miles. Miss Anthony told them in vigorous language: \"The reason\r\nwhy they, as a class, had so little influence with men of business and\r\npolitical affairs was because the vast majority of the people they\r\nrepresented had neither money nor votes; that if four or five hundred\r\nministers of the State should go up to Sacramento to ask for any\r\nlegislation, they would be treated politely and bowed out precisely as\r\nwould so many of their women church members. Whereas, on the other hand,\r\none manufacturer, one railroad official, one brewer or distiller, could\r\ngo before the same body and get whatever he asked, because every member\r\nwould know that behind this request were not only thousands of dollars\r\nbut thousands of votes.\" The ministers seemed to realize fully the force\r\nof this statement and many expressed themselves thoroughly in favor of\r\nthe enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nThe State Suffrage Association, with a good delegate representation, met\r\nin Golden Gate Hall, July 3, for their annual convention. There had been\r\nheretofore some dissensions in this organization and, at this critical\r\ntime, co-operation was so vitally necessary that the friendly offices of\r\nMiss Anthony and Miss Shaw were requested in the interests of harmony.\r\nIn view of the arduous campaign approaching, all desired that Mrs. A. A.\r\nSargent should accept the presidency, and the close of the convention\r\nfound the forces united and ready for work.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth of July witnessed the last public appearance of the two\r\neminent visitors, and thereby hangs a tale. The last of May Miss Anthony\r\nhad received from the chairman of the Fourth of July Executive\r\nCommittee, William H. Davis, the following: \"Fully realizing the great\r\nimportance of your life-work, and rejoicing with you in the certainty\r\nthat the fruition of your labors and hopes is now no longer problematic,\r\nbut merely a question of days, we take much pleasure in extending to you\r\nthe right hand of American fellowship ... We cordially invite you to an\r\nhonorary position on our committee, and hope that you will do us the\r\nhonor of allowing us to select for you an appropriate and prominent\r\nplace in the celebration of our national independence.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it had been decided to celebrate the Fourth on a more elaborate\r\nscale than usual, an auxiliary board was appointed, composed of the\r\nleading women of the city, with Sarah B. Cooper, chairman. Thinking to\r\nadd an interesting feature to the occasion, she requested of the\r\nliterary committee that Rev. Anna Shaw be placed on the program as one\r\nof the orators of the day. To her amazement she was refused in\r\ndiscourteous manner and language. The executive committee, learning of\r\nthis action, requested that it should be reconsidered and Miss Shaw\r\ninvited to speak. This being refused, the executive committee notified\r\nthem that unless it was done, their committee would be discharged and a\r\nnew one appointed. They then yielded to the inevitable, placing Miss\r\nShaw's name upon the list of orators, and the announcement was received\r\nwith cheers by all the other committees. The reverend lady had not the\r\nslightest desire to make a Fourth of July speech, but she did wish to\r\nsee Mrs. Cooper win her battle with the little sub-committee. Meanwhile\r\nthe committee in Oakland, P. M. Fisher, chairman, did not wait to be\r\nasked, but invited her to deliver an oration in that city as soon as she\r\nhad finished in San Francisco, and she accepted.\r\n\r\nIn the great Fourth of July procession, the very next carriage to that\r\nof the mayor contained Mrs. Cooper, Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw, and the\r\nrousing cheers of the people along the whole line of march showed their\r\nappreciation of the victory gained for woman. At 2 o'clock in the\r\nafternoon the ladies took seats on the platform at Woodward's Pavilion,\r\nfacing an audience of 5,000 people. San Francisco never heard such an\r\noration as was delivered that day by the little Methodist preacher, her\r\nnatural eloquence fired by the efforts to prevent her making it. After\r\nshe had finished and the cheers upon cheers had died away, there was a\r\ngreat shout from the immense crowd, \"Miss Anthony, Miss Anthony!\"\r\nFinally she was obliged to come forward and, when a stillness had\r\nsettled upon the audience, she said in strong, ringing tones: \"You have\r\nheard today a great deal of what George Washington, the father of his\r\ncountry, said a hundred years ago. I will repeat to you just one\r\nsentence which Abraham Lincoln, the savior of his country, uttered\r\nwithin the present generation: 'No man is good enough to govern another\r\nman without his consent.' Now I say unto you, 'No man is good enough to\r\ngovern any woman without her consent;'\" and sat down amidst roars of\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nMiss Shaw had been placed at the very end of the program and when she\r\ngot out into the street it was 5 o'clock. It would require an hour to\r\nreach Oakland, and she supposed of course some one had telegraphed the\r\nsituation and the people there had long since gone home; but this had\r\nnot been done, and a great audience on that side of the bay had\r\nassembled in the Tabernacle, many going as early as 1 o'clock, and had\r\nwaited until 6. Knowing there was some mistake they separated with the\r\nunderstanding that if Miss Shaw could be secured for the evening the\r\nchurch bells would be rung. That lady had just seated herself at the\r\ndinner table when a telegram was received explaining the situation. She\r\nreplied at once: \"I will be with you at half-past eight.\" Miss Anthony\r\nwould not let her go alone and so, exhausted as they both were by the\r\nhard demands of the day, they crossed the bay, reaching Oakland at 8\r\no'clock. No one was at the station to meet them, so they took a carriage\r\nand drove to the Tabernacle but found it dark and deserted. They then\r\nwent the rounds of the churches, but all were closed. Finally they gave\r\nup in despair and made the long journey back to San Francisco, reaching\r\nthe Sargent home at 11 o'clock. Why the telegram was not received was\r\nnever satisfactorily determined.\r\n\r\nAfter a meeting with the amendment campaign committee the next morning\r\nand a long discussion of their plan of work, the travellers started\r\neastward at 6 P. M. They were met at the Oakland ferry by a crowd of\r\nfriends from both cities with flowers, fruit and lunch baskets, and left\r\namidst a shower of affectionate farewells. They carried away the\r\nsweetest memories of a lifetime and could find no words to express their\r\nlove and admiration for the people of California.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony preserves, as a memento of this visit, a large scrap-book\r\nof over 200 pages entirely filled with personal notices from the\r\nnewspapers of that State during the six weeks of her stay, all, with a\r\nfew exceptions, of such a character as to make their reading a pleasure.\r\nA source of even greater satisfaction was the wide discussion of woman\r\nsuffrage which her visit had inspired and the favorable consideration\r\naccorded it by the press. In the months which followed she received\r\nscores of letters from California women, many of them unknown to her,\r\nexpressing the sentiments of one from a teacher, which may be quoted:\r\n\"Many of us who could attend but few of the meetings and had not even\r\ntime to meet you personally, have caught something of their spirit and\r\nhave been with you in heart. We bless the day which brought you to us;\r\nfor your kindly words to women, and to men for women, have lifted the\r\nfog, and the veiling mists are drifting away, leaving us a clearer view\r\nof our duty not only to humanity but to ourselves. You have left a trail\r\nof light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] As soon as they arrived in California they were presented by Mrs.\r\nStanford with railroad passes throughout the State.\r\n\r\n[113] The Los Angeles Times, Harrison Gray Otis, editor, furnished the\r\nonly exception of any importance to this rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nMRS. STANTON'S BIRTHDAY--THE BIBLE RESOLUTION.\r\n\r\n1895-1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the way homeward they were met at every large station by friends with\r\nsomething to add to the pleasure of their trip. Miss Shaw went through\r\nto Chicago, but Miss Anthony journeyed towards Leavenworth. She dined\r\nwith friends at Topeka, and while waiting in the station, one of them\r\nremarked, \"We are to have our suffrage meeting tomorrow, what shall we\r\ntell them from you?\" In a spirit of fun she dashed off a resolution\r\nsaying that \"since 130,000 Kansas men declared themselves against woman\r\nsuffrage at the late election and 74,000 showed their opposition by not\r\nvoting; therefore it is the duty of every self-respecting woman in the\r\nState to fold her hands and refuse to help any religious, charitable or\r\nmoral reform or any political association, until the men shall strike\r\nthe adjective 'male' from the suffrage clause of the constitution.\"\r\n\r\nShe was in Topeka only five hours, but during that time attended a\r\ndinner party, gave a two-column interview to a reporter from each of the\r\ncity papers, and furnished a resolution which set all the newspapers in\r\nthe country by the ears. \"Talk about hysterics,\" she said, laughingly,\r\nas she read the clippings, \"it takes the editors to have 'em, if they\r\nare opposed to woman suffrage and can get hold of something to help them\r\nout.\" Any one who could have the patience to read the fearful morals\r\nwhich were deduced, the frightful sermons which were preached, from what\r\nwas intended as a joking resolution, would quite agree with her. Even\r\nhad it been meant seriously, it would have been only such retaliation\r\nas men would have visited upon women had the latter been possessed of\r\nthe power and voted three to one to take the ballot away from them.\r\n\r\nShe visited a week in Leavenworth and Fort Scott, arrived at Chicago\r\nJuly 15, and was thus described by a Herald reporter:\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony has grown slightly thinner since she was in Chicago\r\n     attending the World's Fair Congresses, thinner and more\r\n     spiritual-looking. As she sat last night with her transparent hands\r\n     grasping the arms of her chair, her thin, hatchet face and white\r\n     hair, with only her keen eyes flashing light and fire, she looked\r\n     like Pope Leo XIII. The whole physical being is as nearly submerged\r\n     as possible in a great mentality. She recalls facts, figures, names\r\n     and dates with unerring accuracy. It was no Argus-eyed autocrat who\r\n     told with pardonable pride last night of how her chair at every\r\n     great function in San Francisco was hung with floral wreaths, how\r\n     bouquets were piled at her feet until she could scarcely step for\r\n     them. It was a pleasing story, told by a sweet old woman, of honors\r\n     which she accepted for the sake of a beloved cause.\r\n\r\nThe next day she resumed her journey with Mr. and Mrs. Gross and Harriet\r\nHosmer, who were going to Bar Harbor. She reached her own home at\r\ndaybreak, and here, the diary shows, she sat down on the steps of the\r\nfront porch and read the paper for an hour or two rather than disturb\r\nher sister's morning nap. The first word received from Miss Shaw was\r\nthat she had arrived at her summer home on Cape Cod with a raging fever,\r\nthe result of the great strain of constant speaking and travelling so\r\nmany weeks without rest, and she continued alarmingly ill the remainder\r\nof the summer. She was much distressed because of an engagement she had\r\nto lecture to the Chautauqua Assembly at Lakeside, O., and to relieve\r\nher mind Miss Anthony telegraphed her that she would go in her place.\r\nShe herself felt not the slightest ill effect from her journey, and the\r\nlong interviews published in all the Rochester papers during the week\r\nshe was at home, displayed the keenest and strongest mental power. She\r\nreached Lakeside on the 25th of July and the next day spoke to a large\r\naudience. Towards the close of her address, she ended abruptly, dropped\r\ninto her chair and sank into a dead faint.\r\n\r\nShe was taken at once to Mrs. Southworth's summer home, at which she\r\nwas a guest, and telegrams were sent out by the press reporters\r\nannouncing that she could not live till morning. She learned afterwards\r\nthat long obituary notices were put in type in many of the newspaper\r\noffices. One Chicago paper telegraphed its correspondent: \"5,000 words\r\nif still living; no limit, if dead.\" She was very much vexed at this\r\nmomentary weakness and, using her will-power, by the next day had\r\nrallied sufficiently to return home. The national suffrage business\r\ncommittee, by previous arrangement, met at her house, and she forced\r\nherself to keep up for two days, but felt very dull and tired, and on\r\nthe morning of July 30 she did not rise. A physician was summoned and a\r\ntrained nurse, and for a month she lay helpless with nervous\r\nprostration; her first serious illness in seventy-five years.\r\n\r\nShe is quoted as saying that if she \"had pinched herself right hard she\r\nwould not have fainted.\" One of the papers remarked that \"then she never\r\nwould have known how much the American people thought of her.\" Every\r\nnewspaper had something pleasant to say,[114] many friends wrote letters\r\nof sympathy, and scores whom she had not known personally sent their\r\nwords of admiration. Only her body was weak, her mind was abnormally\r\nalert; she appreciated all that was said and done for her, and remarked\r\noften that this was the only real _rest_ of her lifetime. A number of\r\nrelatives came to visit her, and a little later Mrs. Coonley and Mrs.\r\nSewall. Mr. and Mrs. Gross also stopped on their way home, the latter\r\nleaving $50 for \"the very prettiest wrapper that could be had.\" From her\r\nold anti-slavery co-worker, Samuel May, now eighty-five, came the words:\r\n\r\n     I suppose there is hardly another person in the United States, man\r\n     or woman, who has been engaged in actual hard public labor so long\r\n     as yourself; and is it not a part of your business and a part of\r\n     your duty--in view of the unattained results--to allow yourself\r\n     larger spaces of rest and to put upon yourself more moderate and\r\n     less exhausting tasks? We would not willingly see you retire from\r\n     the field altogether; therefore we want you to do less of the\r\n     common soldier's work and take charge of the reserves, keeping\r\n     watch from your tower of experience, and personally appearing only\r\n     when and where the enemy rallies in unusual numbers or with unusual\r\n     craftiness. This does not imply a lessening of your usefulness but\r\n     an increase, being a wiser application of your strength and\r\n     resources.\r\n\r\nFrom Parker Pillsbury, the old comrade, aged eighty-six: \"We have heard\r\nof your late illness, a warning to constant prudence and care for your\r\nhealth as you come down to 'life's latest stage.' Hold on, my\r\ndear--_our_ dear--Susan, hold on to the last hour possible. You have\r\nseen great and glorious changes, almost revolutions, but yet how much\r\nremains to be encountered and accomplished.... We shall hope you may\r\nlive to see the one grand achievement--the equal civil and political\r\nrights of all women before the law. Then you may well say: 'Lord, now\r\nlettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace; for mine eyes have seen Thy\r\nsalvation.'\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton wrote: \"I never realized how desolate the world would be to\r\nme without you until I heard of your sudden illness. Let me urge you\r\nwith all the strength I have, and all the love I bear you, to stay at\r\nhome and rest and save your precious self.\" From Mrs. Cooper this urgent\r\nmessage: \"You are too far along in years to work as hard as you do. Take\r\nit easy, my beloved friend, and let your young lieutenants bear the heat\r\nand burden of the day, while you give directions from the hill-top of\r\nsurvey. Age has the right to be peaceful, as childhood has the right to\r\nbe playful. You are the youngest of us all, nevertheless nature cries a\r\nhalt and you must obey her call in order to be with us as our leader for\r\na score of years to come.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a long hiatus in the diary, and then for many days the brief\r\nentry, \"On the mend.\" In September she began to walk out a little and\r\nthen to call on the nearest friends, and by the last of the month she\r\nattended a few committee meetings. The rumor had been persistently\r\ncirculated that she was to resign the presidency of the\r\nNational-American Association and retire to private life. In fact, she\r\nnever had the slightest intention of giving up active work. She realized\r\nthat inactivity meant stagnation and hastened both physical and mental\r\ndecay, and she was determined to keep on and \"drop in the harness\" when\r\nthe time came to stop.[115] It was evident, however, that she must have\r\nrelief in her immense correspondence. This she recognized, and so\r\nsecured an efficient stenographer and typewriter in Mrs. Emma B. Sweet,\r\nwho assumed her duties October 1, 1895. The five large files packed with\r\ncopies of letters sent out during the remaining months of the year show\r\nhow pressing was the need of her services. Miss Anthony relates in her\r\ndiary with much satisfaction, that she \"managed to have a letter at\r\nevery State suffrage convention held that fall.\"\r\n\r\nShe thought possibly she might have to work a little more moderately for\r\na while, and one of her first letters was written to the head of the\r\nSlayton Lecture Bureau: \"I should love dearly to say 'yes' to your\r\nproposition for a series of lectures at $100 a night. Nothing short of\r\nthat would tempt me to go on the lyceum platform again, and even to\r\nthat, for the present, I must say 'nay.' I am resolved to be a home-body\r\nthe coming year, with the exception of attending the celebration of Mrs.\r\nStanton's eightieth birthday and our regular Washington convention.\"\r\nAmong the characteristic short letters is this to Dr. Sarah Hackett\r\nStevenson, of Chicago, who had asked for a word of encouragement in\r\nregard to a hospital she was founding for mothers whose children were\r\nborn out of wedlock:\r\n\r\n     I hope your beneficent enterprise may succeed. I trust the day will\r\n     come when there will be no such unfortunate mothers, but until\r\n     then, it certainly is the duty of society to provide for them. The\r\n     first step towards bringing that day is to make women not only\r\n     self-supporting but able to win positions of honor and emolument.\r\n     Since no disfranchised class of men ever had equal chances in the\r\n     world, it is fair to conclude that the first requisite to bring\r\n     them to women is enfranchisement. It is not that all when\r\n     enfranchised will be capable, honest and chaste, but it is that\r\n     they will possess the power to control their own conditions and\r\n     those of society equally with men. Therefore my panacea for the\r\n     ills which your hospital would fain mitigate is the ballot in the\r\n     hands of women.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the Voice wrote for her opinion as to the cause of the\r\nprevailing \"hard times,\" and she answered:\r\n\r\n     The work of my life has been less to find out the causes of men's\r\n     failure to successfully manage affairs, than to try to show them\r\n     their one great failure in attempting to make a successful\r\n     government without the help of women. It used to be said in\r\n     anti-slavery days that a people who would tacitly consent to the\r\n     enslavement of 4,000,000 human beings, were incapable of being just\r\n     to each other, and I believe the same rule holds with regard to the\r\n     injustice practiced by men towards women. So long as all men\r\n     conspire to rob women of their citizen's right to perfect equality\r\n     in all the privileges and immunities of our so-called \"free\"\r\n     government, we can not expect these same men to be capable of\r\n     perfect justice to each other. On the contrary, the inevitable\r\n     result must be trusts, monopolies and all sorts of schemes to get\r\n     an undue share of the proceeds of labor. There is money enough in\r\n     this country today in the hands of the few, if justly distributed,\r\n     to make \"good times\" for all.\r\n\r\nReporters were constantly besieging her for her views on \"bloomers,\"\r\nwhich had been re-introduced by the bicycle, and she usually replied in\r\neffect:\r\n\r\n     My opinion about \"bloomers\" and dress generally for both men and\r\n     women is that people should dress to accommodate whatever business\r\n     or pastime they pursue. It would be quite out of good taste as well\r\n     as good sense, for a woman to go to her daily work with trailing\r\n     skirts, flowing sleeves, fringes and laces; and certainly, if women\r\n     ride the bicycle or climb mountains, they should don a costume\r\n     which will permit them the use of their legs. It is very funny that\r\n     it is ever and always the men who are troubled about the propriety\r\n     of the women's costume. My one word about the \"bloomers\" or any\r\n     other sort of dress, is that every woman, like every man, should be\r\n     permitted to wear exactly what she chooses.\r\n\r\n     When women have equal chances in the world they will cease to live\r\n     merely to please the conventional fancy of men. As long as there\r\n     was no alternative for women but to marry, it was about as much as\r\n     any woman's life was worth to be an old maid, and her one idea was\r\n     to dress and behave so as to escape this fate. She now has other\r\n     objects in life, and her new liberty has brought with it a freedom\r\n     in matters of dress which is cause for rejoicing.\r\n\r\nThese opinions might be multiplied almost to infinity and all would\r\nemphasize two points: 1st, the broad views entertained by Miss Anthony\r\non all questions, based on her idea of individual freedom, the same for\r\nboth sexes; 2d, her fundamental belief that, until women cease to be a\r\nsubject class, and until they stand upon the plane of perfect equality\r\nof rights and privileges, there can be no such thing as a fair solution\r\nor adjustment of the issues of the day, either great or small; in other\r\nwords, that these can not be satisfactorily and permanently settled\r\nthrough the judgment and decision of only one-half the people.\r\n\r\nOn October 18 she celebrated her complete recovery by accepting an\r\ninvitation to \"come and take a cup of tea with Aunt Maria Porter,\" in\r\nhonor of her ninetieth birthday. She was obliged to cancel her\r\nengagement to speak at the Atlanta Exposition, but during this month\r\nmade a trial of her strength by an hour's speech at the annual meeting\r\nof the Monroe County Suffrage Club at Brockport, \"attempting it,\" she\r\nsays, \"with fear and trembling, but going through as if I never had had\r\na scare.\" Assured by this that she had herself well in hand once more,\r\nshe went to Ashtabula, Ohio, for a three days' convention of the State\r\nassociation, attending every business meeting and public session. This\r\nfact being duly heralded in the newspapers, they put the obituary\r\nnotices back into their pigeonholes.\r\n\r\nShe started for New York November 6 to be present at an event to which\r\nshe had looked forward with more pleasure than to anything of that\r\nnature in all her life--the celebration of the eightieth birthday of\r\nMrs. Stanton. At the convention in February it had been unanimously\r\ndecided that the National-American Association should have charge of\r\nthis, but at the Woman's Council in Washington it was agreed that it\r\nwould have greater significance if held under the auspices of that\r\nbody, which cheerfully accepted the charge. Its new president, Mary Lowe\r\nDickinson, urged Miss Anthony to take the chairmanship of the committee\r\nof arrangements, insisting that no one else could make so great a\r\nsuccess of it, but Miss Anthony assured her of what afterwards proved to\r\nbe true, that no one could manage the affair more perfectly than Mrs.\r\nDickinson herself.\r\n\r\nNaturally many of the suffrage women resented having any one outside\r\ntheir own association as the leader on this great occasion, and Lillie\r\nDevereux Blake wrote: \"Mrs. Stanton stands for suffrage above all else\r\nand she should be honored by our societies. To have the celebration\r\nunder the charge of the secretary of the King's Daughters, an orthodox\r\norganization, seems very much out of taste, greatly as I honor Mrs.\r\nDickinson. I do not think any one else will make the celebration such a\r\nsuccess as you would; you, the long-time companion and co-worker with\r\nour dear leader, are the person who should be at the head and, with your\r\nadmirable manner as a presiding officer, you would give a tone to it\r\nthat no one else could.\" To this Miss Anthony replied:\r\n\r\n     All of you fail to see the higher honor to Mrs. Stanton in having\r\n     the celebration mothered by a great body composed of twenty\r\n     national societies, instead of by only our one. Surely, for all\r\n     classes of women--liberal, orthodox, Jewish, Mormon, suffrage and\r\n     anti-suffrage, native and foreign, black and white--to unite in\r\n     paying a tribute of respect to the greatest woman reformer,\r\n     philosopher and statesman of the century, will be the realization\r\n     of Mrs. Stanton's most optimistic dream. I am surprised and\r\n     delighted at the action of the council. It shows a breadth and\r\n     comprehensiveness on the part of the leaders of its twenty-in-one\r\n     organization of which I am very proud. Of course Mrs. Stanton\r\n     stands for suffrage first, last and all the time, and the\r\n     conservative women who join in this celebration do so knowing that\r\n     she stands thus for a free and enfranchised womanhood.\r\n\r\n     Don't you see that for Anthony to head the fray, preside and be\r\n     general master of ceremonies, would reduce it to a mere mutual\r\n     admiration affair? The celebration is not taken away from us. We,\r\n     the suffrage women, will have our modicum of time to set forth what\r\n     Mrs. Stanton has done for our specific cause, and the other women\r\n     will have theirs. O, no, my dear, it is not possible that the\r\n     greater can be less than one of the parts which compose it.\r\n\r\nHer own \"girls,\" Mrs. Sewall and Mrs. Avery, could not help being a\r\nlittle jealous for their general, and insisted that her name should head\r\nthe invitations, but to them she wrote:\r\n\r\n     Do you not see that for Susan B. Anthony's name to stand at the\r\n     top, will frighten the conservatives? Everybody will conclude that\r\n     the big suffrage elephant has possessed the council, body and\r\n     soul--all thrust into the suffrage hopper and the wheel turned by\r\n     S. B. A. To make me chairman will wholly spoil the intention of the\r\n     council, which is and should be to bring the fruits of Mrs.\r\n     Stanton's first demand, fifty years ago, and lay them at her feet;\r\n     not only the suffrage children, but those of education, literature,\r\n     science, reform, religion, all as one. If Mrs. Dickinson single out\r\n     the hoofed and horned head of suffrage as the commander-in-chief,\r\n     not only the nineteen other societies but all the world outside\r\n     will say it is suffrage after all; which it will be, because the\r\n     others won't train under our leadership. No, no; Mrs. Dickinson\r\n     herself must be the chief cook of this broth and appoint her own\r\n     lieutenants, one of whom, with name far down in the middle of the\r\n     list, I shall be most happy to be, and do all I possibly can to\r\n     help, but always in the name of the president of the council.\r\n\r\nShe was true to her word, and in every way assisted Mrs. Dickinson in\r\nthe immense amount of preparation necessary for what was the largest and\r\nmost perfect affair of this nature ever given in America. At her request\r\nMiss Anthony wrote over a hundred letters to collect funds, secure the\r\npresence of the pioneer workers among women, etc., but still insisted on\r\nkeeping herself so much in the background as even to refuse to make one\r\nof the principal speeches of the occasion. When she reached New York,\r\nshe went for the night to her cousin, Mrs. Lapham, and early the next\r\nmorning to Mrs. Stanton's to read over the birthday speech, of which she\r\nwrites: \"My only criticism was that she did not rest her case after\r\ndescribing the wonderful advance made in state, church, society and\r\nhome, instead of going on to single out the church and declare it to be\r\nespecially slow in accepting the doctrine of equality to women. I tried\r\nto make her see that it had advanced as rapidly as the other departments\r\nbut I did not succeed, and it is right that she should express her own\r\nideas, not mine.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day she went to Newburgh to address the State convention,\r\nreturning to New York on the 9th. Friends had come from all parts of\r\nthe country to attend the celebration, and the three days following were\r\npleasantly spent in visiting with them at the different hotels. On the\r\nevening of the 12th occurred the birthday fête. There is not room in\r\nthese pages to describe in full that magnificent gathering, the great\r\nMetropolitan Opera House crowded from pit to dome, each of the boxes\r\nbrilliantly and appropriately decorated and occupied by the\r\nrepresentatives of some organization of women. On the stage was a throne\r\nof flowers and above it an arch with the name \"Stanton\" wrought in red\r\ncarnations on a white ground. When Mrs. Stanton entered, the entire\r\naudience of 3,000 rose to salute her with waving handkerchiefs. At the\r\nright and left of the floral throne sat Miss Anthony and Mrs. Dickinson.\r\nInstead of responding with a set speech, when called upon, Miss Anthony\r\npaid an eloquent tribute to the \"pioneers,\" and then read the most\r\nimportant of the one hundred telegrams of congratulation which had been\r\nreceived from noted societies and eminent men and women in the United\r\nStates and Europe.[116] The New York Sun said: \"In ordinary hands this\r\ntask would have been dull enough, but Miss Anthony enlivened it with her\r\nwit and cleverness and made a success of it.\" It may be truly said that\r\nnot one woman in that audience, not even Mrs. Stanton herself, was\r\nprouder or happier than Miss Anthony over this splendid ovation.\r\n\r\nThe next day a large reception was given at the Savoy by Mrs. Henry\r\nVillard, the only daughter of Wm. Lloyd Garrison; and after various\r\nluncheons and dinners and good-by calls, Miss Anthony returned to\r\nRochester. She plunged into the mountain of correspondence and,\r\nexpecting to spend most of the next year at home, gave every spare\r\nmoment to the arranging and classifying of her mass of documents,\r\npreparatory to some contemplated literary work. On November 21, the\r\nPolitical Equality Club celebrated Mrs. Stanton's birthday in a\r\nbeautiful manner at the Anthony home, over 200 guests attending. Several\r\nunkind newspaper attacks being made upon Miss Anthony by disgruntled\r\nwomen, she wrote Mrs. Stanton, who was much distressed: \"This fresh\r\nonslaught reminds me of the old adage, 'When one is over-praised by the\r\nmany, the few will try to pull down and destroy.' Certainly I know that\r\nin my head and heart there never has been any but the strongest desire\r\nthat all the other workers should have their full meed of opportunity\r\nand reward.\"\r\n\r\nA telegram came November 25 announcing the sudden death, in Boston, of\r\nMrs. Ellen Battelle Dietrick. She had been actively in the suffrage work\r\nfor only a few years, but in that time Miss Anthony had learned her\r\nsplendid powers and had said of her: \"I feel that into her hands can\r\nsafely fall the work of the future, both as to principle and policy.\"\r\nShe had been made chairman of the national press work, and had shown an\r\nunsurpassed beauty and strength of style and thought. \"She was a\r\nphilosopher, a student,\" Miss Anthony wrote, \"possessed of the\r\nconscience and the courage to stand by the truth as she saw it. Can it\r\nbe that she is gone in the very prime of her womanhood? Why can not we\r\nkeep with us the brave and beautiful souls; why can not the weak and\r\nwicked go? The world seems darker to me now, a light has gone out.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 2 she gathered about her a group of the very oldest and\r\ndearest friends in memory of what would have been her mother's one\r\nhundred and second birthday. She records attending a lecture by\r\nPresident Andrew D. White, at the close of which he presented his wife\r\nto her, saying: \"I want you to know her; she is of your kind.\" The day\r\nbefore Christmas came another telegram, this one from May Wright Sewall,\r\ncontaining simply the words: \"Dear General, my Theodore is taken.\" It\r\nmeant the desolation of one of the happiest, most perfect homes ever\r\nmade by two mortals. It told the breaking of as strong and sweet a tie\r\nas ever united husband and wife. What could she write? Only, \"Be brave\r\nin this inevitable hour; take unto yourself the 'joy of sorrow' that you\r\ndid all in mortal power for his restoration, that his happiness was the\r\ndesire of your life; find comfort in the blessed memories of his tender\r\nand never-failing love and care for you in all these beautiful years.\"\r\nBut the poverty, the powerlessness of words in times like this!\r\n\r\nAnd so the old year rolled into the past and the record was finished.\r\nAmong the letters which came to cheer its close, was one from Mary Lowe\r\nDickinson, which ended:\r\n\r\n     In every way, in all this work, how grandly you stood by and helped\r\n     me! Some day you will understand how grateful I am, and how\r\n     thoroughly I appreciate the support, moral and other, that you have\r\n     given me. I know this holiday season will bring you a great many\r\n     loving souvenirs from all over the world, and I haven't sent you\r\n     anything at all; but I have a gift for you, notwithstanding, a gift\r\n     of loyal reverence for the grand outspoken bravery of your life and\r\n     service, a gift of genuine gratitude for what you have been and\r\n     what you have done, and an affection that has been growing ever\r\n     since my first talk with you in Chicago. This is quite a\r\n     declaration for a reserved woman, but it is as sincere as it is\r\n     unusual, and I wish you all sorts of blessings for the New Year,\r\n     and most of all that it may show great progress in the work which\r\n     lies so close to your heart.\r\n\r\nAnd this from her beloved friend, Mrs. Leland Stanford:\r\n\r\n     It is needless for me to express all I feel in regard to your\r\n     tender and long-continued friendship. I always prized it when I had\r\n     my dear husband by my side to help me bear the burdens and sorrows\r\n     of life, but now, standing as I do alone with the weighty cares and\r\n     sacred duties depending upon me, I cherish your sympathy, your\r\n     friendship and your tender words as an evidence of God's love. He\r\n     can instigate and guide hearts to reach out sustaining helpfulness\r\n     to His children, who need just such support as you have given me.\r\n     Long years past and gone, you and Mrs. Stanton were appreciated and\r\n     extolled by my husband more than you ever realized. He predicted\r\n     twenty years ago what has now come, and mainly through the\r\n     instrumentality of yourself and her--the advancement and elevation\r\n     of womanhood--and we are only on the eve of what is to follow in\r\n     the twentieth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Leland Stanford\"]\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was very glad to go back to Washington with the annual\r\nconvention, which was held January 23 to 28, 1896. She went on a week\r\nbeforehand to satisfy herself that all was in readiness. Although the\r\ndetails of the work were assumed by the younger members of the board,\r\nshe was always on the scene of action early enough to look over the\r\nground before the battle opened. This year the papers said: \"A notable\r\nfeature of the suffrage movement is the large number of college alumnæ\r\nand professional women who are coming into the ranks.\" The committee\r\nreported organizations in every State and Territory except Alaska.\r\nDelegates were present from almost every one, among them Mrs. Hughes,\r\nwife of the governor of Arizona, Mrs. Teller, wife of the senator from\r\nColorado, Mrs. Sanders, wife of the ex-senator from Montana, the wives\r\nof Representatives Arnold, Allen, Shafroth and Pickler, Mrs. Ella\r\nKnowles Haskell, assistant attorney-general of Montana. Most of them\r\naddressed the committees of the Senate and House, who gave long and\r\nrespectful hearings.\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of rejoicing at this convention was the admission of\r\nUtah as a State with the full enfranchisement of women. A clause to this\r\neffect had been put into the State constitution, endorsed by all\r\npolitical parties, voted on by the men of the Territory and carried.\r\nThis constitution had been accepted, the new State admitted by Congress,\r\nand the bill was signed by President Cleveland January 4, 1896. A\r\nnoteworthy circumstance in this case was that, while the admission of\r\nWyoming with a woman suffrage clause in its constitution was fought for\r\nmany days in both Senate and House in 1890, that of Utah was accepted\r\nwith scarcely a protest against its enfranchisement of women. There was\r\nalso rejoicing over the fact that, during the autumn of 1895, the full\r\nfranchise had been conferred upon the women of South Australia.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of the convention which forever made its memory a sad one\r\nto Miss Anthony was the so-called \"Bible resolution.\" It had this effect\r\nnot only because of the resolution itself but because those who were\r\nresponsible for it were especially near and dear to her. Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton, assisted by a committee of women, had been for several years\r\npreparing a work called the \"Woman's Bible.\" It contained no discussion\r\nof doctrinal questions but was simply a commentary upon those texts and\r\nchapters directly referring to women, and a few others from which they\r\nwere conspicuously excluded. Naturally, however, this pamphlet caused a\r\ngreat outcry, especially from those who had not read a word of it. That\r\nwomen should dare analyze even the passages referring to themselves in a\r\nbook which heretofore, neither in the original writing nor in all the\r\nrevisions of the centuries, had felt the impress of a woman's brain or\r\nthe touch of a woman's hand, stirred the orthodox to their greater or\r\nless depths. Mrs. Stanton was honorary president of the\r\nNational-American Suffrage Association, but had not attended its\r\nmeetings or actively participated in its work for a number of years.\r\n\r\nSeveral members of the board, who were children when she and Miss\r\nAnthony founded that organization, and unborn when Mrs. Stanton called\r\nthe first woman's rights convention, decided that her Woman's Bible was\r\ninjuring the association, although only the chapters on the Pentateuch\r\nthus far had been published. They determined that this body should take\r\nofficial action on the question, but they understood perfectly that it\r\nwould have to be brought before the convention without any previous\r\nknowledge on the part of Miss Anthony. Therefore it was planned to have\r\na paragraph of condemnation and renunciation of the Woman's Bible\r\nincorporated in the report of the corresponding secretary. When it was\r\nread in open meeting she was struck dumb. Mrs. Colby sprung to her feet\r\nand moved that the report be accepted, all but the paragraph relating to\r\nthe Woman's Bible. After an animated discussion the secretary's report\r\nwas laid on the table and later was adopted with the offending clause\r\nstricken out. Miss Anthony supposed this was the end of the matter but,\r\nto her amazement, the committee on resolutions reported the following:\r\n\"This association is non-sectarian, being composed of persons of all\r\nshades of religious opinions, and has no official connection with the\r\nso-called Woman's Bible, or any theological publication.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution was wholly gratuitous. While true that the association\r\nwas composed of persons of all shades of religious opinion, it comprised\r\nalso among some of its oldest and ablest members those who entertained\r\nno so-called religious beliefs. Mrs. Stanton invariably had announced\r\nthat this revision of the Scriptures was the individual work of herself\r\nand her committee, and there was no ground for holding the whole\r\nassociation responsible. The resolution, however, was debated for an\r\nhour. Miss Anthony was moved as never before. Not only was she fired\r\nwith indignation at this insult to the woman whom she loved and revered\r\nabove all others, but she was outraged at this deliberate attempt to\r\ndeny personal liberty of thought and speech. Leaving the chair she said\r\nin an impassioned appeal:\r\n\r\n     The one distinct feature of our association has been the right of\r\n     individual opinion for every member. We have been beset at each\r\n     step with the cry that somebody was injuring the cause by the\r\n     expression of sentiments which differed from those held by the\r\n     majority. The religious persecution of the ages has been carried on\r\n     under what was claimed to be the command of God. I distrust those\r\n     people who know so well what God wants them to do, because I notice\r\n     it always coincides with their own desires. All the way along the\r\n     history of our movement there has been this same contest on account\r\n     of religious theories. Forty years ago one of our noblest men said\r\n     to me, \"You would better never hold another convention than allow\r\n     Ernestine L. Rose on your platform;\" because that eloquent woman,\r\n     who ever stood for justice and freedom, did not believe in the\r\n     plenary inspiration of the Bible. Did we banish Mrs. Rose? No,\r\n     indeed!\r\n\r\n     Every new generation of converts threshes over the same old straw.\r\n     The point is whether you will sit in judgment on one who questions\r\n     the divine inspiration of certain passages in the Bible derogatory\r\n     to women. If Mrs. Stanton had written approvingly of these passages\r\n     you would not have brought in this resolution for fear the cause\r\n     might be injured among the _liberals_ in religion. In other words,\r\n     if she had written _your_ views, you would not have considered a\r\n     resolution necessary. To pass this one is to set back the hands on\r\n     the dial of reform.\r\n\r\n     What you should say to outsiders is that a Christian has neither\r\n     more nor less rights in our association than an atheist. When our\r\n     platform becomes too narrow for people of all creeds and of no\r\n     creeds, I myself can not stand upon it. Many things have been said\r\n     and done by our _orthodox_ friends which I have felt to be\r\n     extremely harmful to our cause; but I should no more consent to a\r\n     resolution denouncing them than I shall consent to this. Who is to\r\n     draw the line? Who can tell now whether these commentaries may not\r\n     prove a great help to woman's emancipation from old superstitions\r\n     which have barred its way? Lucretia Mott at first thought Mrs.\r\n     Stanton had injured the cause of all woman's other rights by\r\n     insisting upon the demand for suffrage, but she had sense enough\r\n     not to bring in a resolution against it. In 1860 when Mrs. Stanton\r\n     made a speech before the New York Legislature in favor of a bill\r\n     making drunkenness a ground for divorce, there was a general cry\r\n     among the friends that she had killed the woman's cause. I shall be\r\n     pained beyond expression if the delegates here are so narrow and\r\n     illiberal as to adopt this resolution. You would better not begin\r\n     resolving against individual action or you will find no limit. This\r\n     year it is Mrs. Stanton; next year it may be I or one of\r\n     yourselves, who will be the victim.\r\n\r\n     If we do not inspire in women a broad and catholic spirit, they\r\n     will fail, when enfranchised, to constitute that power for better\r\n     government which we have always claimed for them. Ten women\r\n     educated into the practice of liberal principles would be a\r\n     stronger force than 10,000 organized on a platform of intolerance\r\n     and bigotry. I pray you vote for religious liberty, without\r\n     censorship or inquisition. This resolution adopted will be a vote\r\n     of censure upon a woman who is without a peer in intellectual and\r\n     statesmanlike ability; one who has stood for half a century the\r\n     acknowledged leader of progressive thought and demand in regard to\r\n     all matters pertaining to the absolute freedom of women.\r\n\r\nRev. Anna Shaw, Carrie Chapman Catt, Henry B. and Alice Stone Blackwell,\r\nLaura M. Johns, Annie L. Diggs, Rachel Foster Avery, Laura Clay, Mariana\r\nW. Chapman, Elizabeth Upham Yates, and others spoke in favor of the\r\nresolution; Lillie Devereux Blake, Clara B. Colby, Mary S. Anthony,\r\nEmily Rowland, Charlotte Perkins Stetson and Caroline Hallowell Miller\r\nwere among those who opposed it. The vote resulted, 53 ayes, 41 nays;\r\nand the resolution was adopted. The situation was felicitously expressed\r\nin a single sentence by Mrs. Caroline McCullough Everhard, president of\r\nthe Ohio Suffrage Association: \"If women were governed more by principle\r\nand less by prejudice, how strong they would be!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony's feelings could not be put into words. At first she\r\nseriously contemplated resigning her office, but from all parts of the\r\ncountry came letters from the pioneer workers--the women who had stood\r\nby her for more than twoscore years--pointing out that this action of\r\nthe convention was a striking illustration of the necessity for her\r\nremaining at the helm. Mrs. Stanton urged that they both resign, but\r\nMiss Anthony replied:\r\n\r\n     During three weeks of agony of soul, with scarcely a night of\r\n     sleep, I have felt I must resign my presidency, but then the rights\r\n     of the minority are to be respected and protected by me quite as\r\n     much as the action of the majority is to be resented; and it is\r\n     even more my duty to stand firmly with the minority because\r\n     principle is with them. I feel very sure that after a year's\r\n     reflection upon the matter, the same women, and perhaps the one\r\n     man, who voted for this interference with personal rights, will be\r\n     ready to declare that their duty as individuals does not require\r\n     them to disclaim freedom of speech in their co-workers. Sister Mary\r\n     says the action of the convention convinces her that the time has\r\n     not yet come for me to resign; whereas she had felt most strongly\r\n     that I ought to do it for my own sake. No, my dear, instead of my\r\n     resigning and leaving those half-fledged chickens without any\r\n     mother, I think it my duty and the duty of yourself and all the\r\n     liberals to be at the next convention and try to reverse this\r\n     miserable, narrow action.\r\n\r\nIn letters to the different members of her \"cabinet,\" who had voted in\r\nfavor of the resolution, she thus expressed herself:\r\n\r\n     In this action I see nothing but the beginning of a petty\r\n     espionage, a revival of the Spanish inquisition, subjecting to\r\n     spiritual torture every one who speaks or writes what the other\r\n     members consider not good for the association. Such disclaimers\r\n     bring quite as much of martyrdom for our civilization as did the\r\n     rack and fire in the barbarous ages of the past.\r\n\r\n     That a majority of the delegates could see no wrong personally to\r\n     Mrs. Stanton and no violation of the right of individual judgment,\r\n     makes me sick at heart; and still, I don't know what better one\r\n     could expect when our ranks are now so filled with young women not\r\n     yet out of bondage to the idea of the infallibility of that book.\r\n     To every person who really believes in religious freedom, it is no\r\n     worse to criticise those pages in the Bible which degrade woman\r\n     than it is to criticise the laws on our statute books which degrade\r\n     her. Everything spoken or written by Jew or Greek, Gentile or\r\n     Christian, or by any human being whomsoever, is not too sacred to\r\n     be criticised by any other human being.\r\n\r\nShe was far too magnanimous, however, and loved the cause too well to\r\nrelax her efforts for the welfare of the association. Before the year\r\nclosed she received from Mrs. Avery and Mrs. Upton most tender and\r\nbeautiful letters, acknowledging their mistake, expressing their sorrow\r\nand begging to be reinstated in her confidence and affection.[117]\r\n\r\nIn order that Miss Anthony's position maybe clearly understood and that\r\nshe may not appear biased and one-sided, and in order also to consider\r\nthis question all at one time, her point of view will be a little\r\nfurther illustrated. In an interview in the Rochester Democrat and\r\nChronicle she is thus reported:\r\n\r\n     \"Did you have anything to do with the new Bible, Miss Anthony?\" was\r\n     asked.\r\n\r\n     \"No, I did not contribute to it, though I knew of its preparation.\r\n     My own relations to or ideas of the Bible always have been\r\n     peculiar, owing to my Quaker training. The Friends consider the\r\n     book as historical, made up of traditions, but not as a plenary\r\n     inspiration. Of course people say these women are impious and\r\n     presumptuous for daring to interpret the Scriptures as they\r\n     understand them, but I think women have just as good a right to\r\n     interpret and twist the Bible to their own advantage as men always\r\n     have twisted and turned it to theirs.... It was written by men, and\r\n     therefore its reference to women reflects the light in which they\r\n     were regarded in those days. In the same way the history of our\r\n     Revolutionary War was written, in which very little is said of the\r\n     noble deeds of women, though we know how they stood by and helped\r\n     the great work; and it is the same with history all through.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough she stood so firm for individual rights she nevertheless\r\nregretted that Mrs. Stanton should give the few remaining years of her\r\nprecious life to this commentary, and frequently wrote in the following\r\nstrain, when importuned to assist in it:\r\n\r\n     I can not help but feel that in this you are talking down to the\r\n     most ignorant masses, whereas your rule always has been to speak to\r\n     the highest, knowing there would be a few who would comprehend, and\r\n     would in turn give of their best to those on the next lower round\r\n     of the ladder. The cultivated men and women of today are above the\r\n     need of your book. Even the liberalized orthodox ministers are\r\n     coming to our aid and their conventions are passing resolutions in\r\n     favor of woman's equality, and I feel that these men and women who\r\n     are just born into the kingdom of liberty can better reach the\r\n     minds of their followers than can any of us out-and-out radicals.\r\n     But while I do not consider it my duty to tear to tatters the\r\n     lingering skeletons of the old superstitions and bigotries, yet I\r\n     rejoice to see them crumbling on every side.\r\n\r\nMonths after this Washington convention, when Miss Anthony was in the\r\nmidst of a great political campaign in California, she sent Mrs. Stanton\r\nthis self-explanatory letter:\r\n\r\n     You say \"women must be emancipated from their superstitions before\r\n     enfranchisement will be of any benefit,\" and I say just the\r\n     reverse, that women must be enfranchised before they can be\r\n     emancipated from their superstitions. Women would be no more\r\n     superstitious today than men, if they had been men's political and\r\n     business equals and gone outside the four walls of home and the\r\n     other four of the church into the great world, and come in contact\r\n     with and discussed men and measures on the plane of this mundane\r\n     sphere, instead of living in the air with Jesus and the angels. So\r\n     you will have to keep pegging away, saying, \"Get rid of religious\r\n     bigotry and then get political rights;\" while I shall keep pegging\r\n     away, saying, \"Get political rights first and religious bigotry\r\n     will melt like dew before the morning sun;\" and each will continue\r\n     still to believe in and defend the other.\r\n\r\n     Now, especially in this California campaign, I shall no more thrust\r\n     into the discussions the question of the Bible than the manufacture\r\n     of wine. What I want is for the men to vote \"yes\" on the suffrage\r\n     amendment, and I don't ask whether they make wine on the ranches in\r\n     California or believe Christ made it at the wedding feast. I have\r\n     your grand addresses before Congress and enclose one in nearly\r\n     every letter I write. I have scattered all your \"celebration\"\r\n     speeches that I had, but I shall not circulate your \"Bible\"\r\n     literature a particle more than Frances Willard's prohibition\r\n     literature. So don't tell Mrs. Colby or anybody else to load me\r\n     down with Bible, social purity, temperance, or any other arguments\r\n     under the sun but just those for woman's right to have her opinion\r\n     counted at the ballot-box.\r\n\r\n     I have been pleading with Miss Willard for the last three months to\r\n     withdraw her threatened W. C. T. U. invasion of California this\r\n     year, and at last she has done it; now, for heaven's sake, don't\r\n     you propose a \"Bible invasion.\" It is not because I hate religious\r\n     bigotry less than you do, or because I love prohibition less than\r\n     Frances Willard does, but because I consider suffrage more\r\n     important just now.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Miss Anthony's attitude ought to be perfectly understood\r\nby the testimony here presented. It is one from which she never has\r\nswerved and on which she is willing to stand in the pages of\r\nhistory--entire freedom for herself from religious superstition--the\r\nmost absolute religious liberty for every other human being.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Washington convention: Among many pleasant social\r\nfeatures Miss Anthony was invited to an elegant luncheon given by Mrs.\r\nJohn R. McLean in honor of the seventieth birthday of Mrs. Ulysses S.\r\nGrant and, at the reception which followed, received the guests with\r\nMrs. Grant and Mrs. McLean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"I am yours with great respect and sincere\r\nadmiration, Julia D. Grant\"]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the convention the principal speakers and many of the\r\ndelegates went to Philadelphia to a national conference, which was\r\nlargely attended. It was here that \"Nelly Bly\" had the famous interview\r\npublished in the New York World of February 2, 1896. She had tried to\r\nsecure this in Washington, but Miss Anthony could not spare time for it,\r\nso she followed her to Philadelphia. It filled a page of the Sunday\r\nedition and contained Miss Anthony's opinions on most of the leading\r\ntopics of the day, in the main correctly reported, although not a note\r\nwas taken. It began thus:\r\n\r\n     Susan B. Anthony! She was waiting for me. I stood for an instant in\r\n     the doorway and looked at her. She made a picture to remember and\r\n     to cherish. She sat in a low rocking-chair, an image of repose and\r\n     restfulness. Her well-shaped head, with its silken snowy hair\r\n     combed smoothly over her ears, rested against the back of the\r\n     chair. Her shawl had half fallen from her shoulders and her soft\r\n     black silk gown lay in gentle folds about her. Her slender hands\r\n     were folded idly in her lap, and her feet, crossed, just peeped\r\n     from beneath the edge of her skirt. If she had been posed for a\r\n     picture, it could not have been done more artistically.\r\n\r\n     \"Do you know the world is a blank to me?\" she said after we had\r\n     exchanged greetings. \"I haven't read a newspaper in ten days and I\r\n     feel lost to everything. Tell me about Cuba! I almost would be\r\n     willing to postpone the enfranchisement of women to see Cuba\r\n     free....\"\r\n\r\n     \"Do you believe in immortality?\"\r\n\r\n     \"I don't know anything about heaven or hell,\" she answered, \"or\r\n     whether I will meet my friends again or not, but as no particle of\r\n     matter is ever destroyed, I have a feeling that no particle of mind\r\n     is ever lost. I am sure that the same wise power which manages the\r\n     present may be trusted with the hereafter.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Then you don't find life tiresome?\"\r\n\r\n     \"O, mercy, no! I don't want to die as long as I can work; the\r\n     minute I can not, I want to go. I dread the thought of being\r\n     enfeebled. The older I get, the greater power I seem to have to\r\n     help the world; I am like a snowball--the further I am rolled the\r\n     more I gain. But,\" she added, significantly, \"I'll have to take it\r\n     as it comes. I'm just as much in eternity now as after the breath\r\n     goes out of my body.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Do you pray?\"\r\n\r\n     \"I pray every single second of my life; not on my knees, but with\r\n     my work. My prayer is to lift woman to equality with man. Work and\r\n     worship are one with me. I can not imagine a God of the universe\r\n     made happy by my getting down on my knees and calling him\r\n     'great.'...\r\n\r\n     \"What do I think of marriage? True marriage, the real marriage of\r\n     soul, when two people take each other on terms of perfect equality,\r\n     without the desire of one to control the other, is a beautiful\r\n     thing; it is the highest condition of life; but for a woman to\r\n     marry for support is demoralizing; and for a man to marry a woman\r\n     merely because she has a beautiful figure or face is\r\n     degradation....\"\r\n\r\n     \"Do you like flowers?\" I asked, leading her into another channel.\r\n\r\n     \"I like roses first and pinks second, and nothing else after,\" Miss\r\n     Anthony laughed. \"I don't call anything a flower that hasn't a\r\n     sweet perfume.\"\r\n\r\n     \"What is your favorite hymn or ballad?\"\r\n\r\n     \"The dickens!\" she exclaimed merrily. \"I don't know! I can't tell\r\n     one tune from another. I know there are such hymns as 'Sweet By and\r\n     By' and 'Old Hundred,' but I can not tell them apart. All music\r\n     sounds alike to me, but still if there is the slightest discord it\r\n     hurts me. Neither do I know anything about art,\" she continued,\r\n     \"yet when I go into a room filled with pictures my friends say I\r\n     invariably pick out the best. I have good company, I always think,\r\n     in my musical ignorance. Wendell Phillips couldn't recognize tunes;\r\n     neither could Anna Dickinson.\"\r\n\r\n     \"What's your favorite motto, or have you one?\"\r\n\r\n     \"For the last thirty years I have written in all albums, 'Perfect\r\n     equality of rights for women, civil and political;' or, 'I know\r\n     only woman and her disfranchised.' There is another, one of Charles\r\n     Sumner's, 'Equal rights for all.' I never write sentimental\r\n     things....\r\n\r\n     \"Yes, I'll tell you what I think of bicycling,\" she said, leaning\r\n     forward and laying a hand on my arm. \"I think it has done more to\r\n     emancipate woman than any one thing in the world. I rejoice every\r\n     time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives her a feeling of\r\n     self-reliance and independence the moment she takes her seat; and\r\n     away she goes, the picture of untrammelled womanhood.\"\r\n\r\n     \"What do you think the new woman will be?\"\r\n\r\n     \"She'll be free,\" said Miss Anthony. \"Then she'll be whatever her\r\n     best judgment dictates. We can no more imagine what the true woman\r\n     will be than what the true man will be. We haven't him yet, and it\r\n     will be generations after we gain freedom before we have the\r\n     highest man and woman. They will constantly change for the better,\r\n     as the world does. What is the best possible today will be outgrown\r\n     tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n     \"What would you call woman's best attribute?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Good common sense; she has a great deal of uncommon sense now, but\r\n     I want her to be an all-around woman, not gifted overly in one\r\n     respect and lacking in others....\"\r\n\r\n     \"And now,\" I said, approaching a very delicate subject on tip-toe,\r\n     \"tell me one thing more. Were you ever in love?\"\r\n\r\n     \"In love?\" she laughed. \"Bless you, Nelly, I've been in love a\r\n     thousand times!\"\r\n\r\n     \"Really!\" I gasped, taken back by this startling confession.\r\n\r\n     \"Yes, really,\" nodding her snowy head; \"but I never loved anyone so\r\n     much that I thought it would last. In fact, I never felt I could\r\n     give up my life of freedom to become a man's housekeeper. When I\r\n     was young, if a girl married poverty, she became a drudge; if she\r\n     married wealth, she became a doll. Had I married at twenty-one, I\r\n     would have been either a drudge or a doll for fifty-five years.\r\n     Think of it!\" and she laughed again....\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony's seventy-sixth birthday was celebrated by the Rochester\r\nPolitical Equality Club at the residence of Dr. and Mrs. S. A. Linn. The\r\nspacious and beautifully decorated rooms were crowded with guests, and\r\ninteresting addresses were given by Mrs. Greenleaf, Mrs. Gannett, Mr. J.\r\nM. Thayer and Mary Seymour Howell, to which Miss Anthony made a happy\r\nresponse. On February 17 she spoke at a church fair given by the colored\r\npeople of Bath, and then completed her preparations for a long journey\r\nand a great campaign. It will be remembered that Miss Anthony had\r\ndecided to rest from \"field work\" during 1896, and to arrange her papers\r\nfor the writing of the history of her life, which her friends felt was\r\nnow the most important thing for her to do. To this end a roomy\r\nhalf-story had been built on the substantial Rochester home, and therein\r\nwere placed all the big boxes and trunks of letters and documents which\r\nhad been accumulating during the last fifty years and stored in\r\nwoodshed, cellar and closets; a stenographer had been engaged and all\r\nwas in readiness for the great work. Then came an appeal from 3,000\r\nmiles away which rent asunder all her resolutions.\r\n\r\nWhen she had been in California the previous year and had helped the\r\nwomen plan their approaching campaign, nothing had been further from her\r\nthoughts than returning to give her personal assistance. As the time for\r\naction drew near, those who had the matter in charge began to realize\r\nthat the task before them was far greater than they had anticipated, and\r\nthat they were lacking in the experience which would be needed. There\r\nwere very few women who could be depended on to draw together and\r\naddress great audiences of thousands of people, to speak thirty\r\nconsecutive nights in each month, and to be equal to every emergency of\r\na political campaign; nor were there any considerable number who\r\nunderstood the best methods of organization. It was then both natural\r\nand sensible that the State society should appeal to the national\r\nassociation for assistance. It is an essential part of the business of\r\nthe officers of that body to respond to such calls.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony had been home from California but a short time in 1895 when\r\nEllen C. Sargent, president of the State association, wrote an earnest\r\nofficial request for the help of the national board. At the same time\r\nSarah B. Cooper, president of the campaign committee, sent the strongest\r\nletter her eloquent pen could write, emphasizing Mrs. Sargent's\r\ninvitation. These were followed by similar pleas from the other members\r\nof the board and from many prominent women of the State. Miss Anthony\r\nfelt at first as if it would not be possible for her to make the long\r\ntrip and endure the fatigue of a campaign, which she understood so well\r\nfrom having experienced it seven times over. On the other hand she\r\nrealized what a tremendous impetus would be given to the cause of woman\r\nsuffrage if the great State of California should carry this amendment,\r\nand she longed to render every assistance in her power. It was not,\r\nhowever, until early in February that she yielded to the appeals and\r\ndecided to abandon all the plans she had cherished for the year. The\r\nmoment her decision reached California, Harriet Cooper, secretary of the\r\ncommittee, telegraphed their delight and sent her a check of $120 for\r\ntravelling expenses.\r\n\r\nThe question now arose with Miss Anthony what she should do with her\r\nsecretary, whom she had engaged for a year but did not feel able to take\r\nwith her. This was settled in a few days through the action of Rev. and\r\nMrs. W. C. Gannett, who went among the friends and in a short time\r\nraised the money to pay Mrs. Sweet's expenses to California and back,\r\nall agreeing that Miss Anthony must have some one to relieve her of the\r\nmechanical part of the burden she was about to assume. This seemed too\r\ngood to be true, as she had had no such help in all her forty-five years\r\nof public work. The two started on the evening of February 27, a large\r\nparty of friends assembling at the station to say good-by to the veteran\r\nof seventy-six years about to enter another battle. They stopped at Ann\r\nArbor for the Michigan convention, the guests of Mrs. Hall, and then a\r\nfew days in Chicago, where Miss Anthony and Mrs. Gross sat for a\r\nstatuette by Miss Bessie Potter.\r\n\r\nShe reached San Diego March 10 and, after attending the Woman's Club,\r\nwent to Los Angeles where she was beautifully received, sharing the\r\nhonors with Robert J. Burdette at the Friday Morning Club. Mrs. Alice\r\nMoore McComas wrote to Mrs. Sargent and Mrs. Cooper the next day: \"Dear\r\nMiss Anthony came, saw and conquered, and we are hers! Letters and\r\ntelegrams were dispatched in every direction as soon as we found she was\r\ncoming and she has been able to reach women that I have almost despaired\r\nof. Dozens who have heretofore held aloof, have promised me today to\r\nstand by the amendment till all is over, and with these recruits we feel\r\nthat we can undertake the convention work in this county. The women are\r\naroused and we will see that they stay aroused. Miss Anthony's visit was\r\nopportune and just what was needed.\"\r\n\r\nShe arrived at San Francisco a few days later, being joyfully greeted at\r\nthe Oakland station by Mrs. Cooper and Harriet. She went directly to the\r\nSargent residence, and from this delightful home, Miss Anthony, the\r\nNational president, and Mrs. Sargent, the State president, directed the\r\ngreat campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[114] The following from the Wichita Eagle is noteworthy because in the\r\nKansas campaign the year before, and in all previous years, it had been\r\nabusive beyond description and had at all times put every possible\r\nstumbling-block in the way of woman suffrage and berated all who\r\nadvocated it:\r\n\r\n\"What an experience Miss Anthony has had! None but a remarkable woman\r\ncould have accepted such a life-work at a time when prejudice and\r\neducation ran all in the opposite direction. Finely-balanced and\r\nself-educated as to her special cause, she has not only won a name and\r\nfame world-wide, but turned perceptibly the entire current of human\r\nconviction. And she has been, through it all, the modest woman, truly\r\nwomanly. The men and women of this country--of the world--who believe\r\nthat the ballot for woman means better government and the elevation of\r\nsociety to a higher plane, must ever recognize Susan B. Anthony as the\r\nreal pioneer prophetess of the cause, for so will history record her.\"\r\n\r\n[115] Miss Anthony was many times besought to tell the secret of her\r\nwonderful vitality and power for work, and on one occasion wrote the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"As machinery in motion lasts longer than when lying idle, so a body and\r\nsoul in active exercise escape the corroding rust of physical and mental\r\nlaziness, which prematurely cuts off the life of so many women. I\r\nbelieve I am able to endure the strain of daily travelling and lecturing\r\nat over threescore years and ten, mainly because I have always worked\r\nand loved work. As to my habits of life, it has been impossible for me\r\nto have fixed rules for eating, resting, sleeping, etc. The only advice\r\nI could give a young person on this point would be: 'Live as simply as\r\nyou can. Eat what you find agrees with your constitution--when you can\r\nget it; sleep whenever you are sleepy, and think as little of these\r\ndetails as possible.'\"\r\n\r\n[116] Among others was a beautiful testimonial from Theodore Tilton, who\r\nhad been for many years a resident of Paris, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"At the present day, every woman who seeks the legal custody of her\r\nchildren, or the legal control of her property; every woman who finds\r\nthe doors of a college or a university opening to her; every woman who\r\nadministers a post-office or a public library; every woman who enters\r\nupon a career of medicine, law or theology; every woman who teaches a\r\nschool, or tills a farm, or keeps a shop; every one who drives a horse,\r\nrides a bicycle, skates at a rink, swims at a summer resort, plays golf\r\nor tennis in a public park, or even snaps a kodak; every such woman, I\r\nsay, owes her liberty largely to yourself and to your earliest and\r\nbravest co-workers in the cause of woman's emancipation. So I send my\r\ngreetings not to you alone, but also to the small remainder now living\r\nof your original bevy of noble assistants, among whom--first, last and\r\nalways--has been and still continues to be your fit mate, chief\r\ncounselor and executive right hand, Susan B. Anthony; a heroine of hard\r\nwork who, when her own eightieth birthday shall roll round, will\r\nlikewise deserve a national ovation, at which she should not\r\ninappropriately receive the old Roman crown of oak.\"\r\n\r\nThis was accompanied by a personal letter to Miss Anthony, saying,\r\nbesides other pleasant things: \"I heard lately that you were dying! I\r\ndid not believe the canard. Dying? No! You are to live forever. Give my\r\nlove to the heroine of the hour--and prepare yourself for an equal\r\npicnic when your own time shall come. Ever yours as of old.\"\r\n\r\n[117] In a letter to the Woman's Tribune Mrs. Jean Brooks Greenleaf\r\nsaid: \"I was absent from the convention and could not vote against that\r\nresolution. The 'Woman's Bible' a hindrance to organization? Of course\r\nit is. What of it? The belief in the old theories about women, which had\r\ntheir basis in doctrines taught from King James' version of the Bible,\r\nwas a much more monumental hindrance to the work of the pioneers, in not\r\nonly the woman suffrage movement but in all movements for the\r\nadvancement of women.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their State convention of 1894 the Republicans of California had\r\nadopted the strongest possible plank in favor of woman suffrage and, as\r\nthe legislature the next year was Republican by a considerable majority,\r\nClara Foltz and Laura de Force Gordon, attorneys, and Nellie Holbrook\r\nBlinn, at that time State president, Mrs. Peet, Madame Sorbier, Mrs.\r\nBidwell, Mrs. Spencer, of Lassen county, and others made a determined\r\neffort to secure a bill enfranchising women. That failing, the\r\nlegislature consented to submit an amendment to the constitution to be\r\nvoted on in 1896. This bill was signed by Governor James H. Budd and the\r\nwomen then prepared to canvass the State to secure a favorable majority.\r\n\r\nOut of the officers of the State suffrage association and the amendment\r\ncommittee, a joint campaign committee was formed and, in addition to\r\nthis, a State central committee.[118] These two constituted the working\r\nforce at State headquarters. There were also speakers and organizers,\r\nand a regularly officered society in each county, co-operating with the\r\nofficials at headquarters.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the State committee Miss Anthony's niece, Lucy E., for\r\nseven years Miss Shaw's secretary and thoroughly experienced in planning\r\nand arranging meetings, went out early in February to assist Dr.\r\nElizabeth Sargent in the preparations for the first series of\r\nconventions. She carried with her a complete list, made by Miss Anthony\r\nherself with great labor and care, of every town of over two hundred\r\ninhabitants in every county in the State, with instructions to plan for\r\na meeting there during the campaign. One scarcely can describe the\r\nperplexing work of these young women in arranging this great sweep of\r\nconventions, two days in every county seat, each convention overlapping\r\nthe next, getting the speakers from one to the other on time, finding\r\nwomen in each town or city who would take charge of local arrangements,\r\nand rounding up the whole series in season for the Woman's Congress in\r\nMay. In March the campaign committee invited Mary G. Hay, who had had\r\ntwelve years' experience in organization work, and Harriet May Mills,\r\nthe State organizer of New York, to manage the conventions; and Rev.\r\nAnna Shaw and Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates as speakers. It is impossible\r\nto follow these meetings in detail further than to say that, with but\r\nfew exceptions, they were very successful, the audiences were large and\r\ncordial, clubs were formed, much suffrage sentiment was created, and the\r\nconventions considerably more than paid all expenses. The women of\r\nCalifornia possessed ability, energy, patriotism and desire for\r\npolitical freedom, but up to this time they had no conception of the\r\nimmense amount of money and work which would be required for a campaign.\r\nAs soon as they grasped the situation they were fully equal to its\r\ndemands and never in all the history of the movement was so much\r\nsplendid work done, or so large a fund raised, by the women of any\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ellen Clark Sargent (Signed: \"Ellen Clark Sargent.\")]\r\n\r\nIt was unanimously agreed that Miss Anthony should remain in San\r\nFrancisco, answering the numerous calls for addresses in that city and\r\nthe surrounding towns, and having general oversight of the campaign.\r\nMrs. Sargent assigned to her the largest, sunniest room in her spacious\r\nhome, but her hospitality and her services to the cause of the amendment\r\ndid not end here. Another large apartment was appropriated to Rev. Anna\r\nShaw and her secretary. The room formerly used as the senator's\r\noffice was dedicated to the work, the typewriters ensconced there, and\r\nit soon was crowded with documents, newspapers and all the paraphernalia\r\nof a campaign. In a little while they encroached on the library and it\r\nwas filled with the litter. Then a typewriter found its way into one\r\ncorner of the long dining-room. The committee meetings were held in the\r\ndrawing-room; and, during the whole eight months, there was scarcely a\r\nmeal at which there were not from one to half a dozen speakers, members\r\nof committees, out-of-town workers and others besides her family at the\r\ntable. Every hour of Mrs. Sargent's and Dr. Elizabeth's time was devoted\r\nto the campaign. The latter was placed at the head of the literary\r\ncommittee and also took entire charge of the petition work for the\r\nState, involving months of most exacting labor. In addition to all this,\r\nboth gave most liberally in money. How much was accomplished by Mrs.\r\nSargent's quiet influence, her wise and judicial advice, her many\r\nlogical and dignified appeals in person and by letter, never can be\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\nThe State board and committees were composed of women of fine character\r\nand social standing, who commanded the highest respect; and during the\r\nlong campaign they put aside every other duty and pleasure and devoted\r\nthemselves, mind and body, to the success of the amendment. Across the\r\nbay in Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley were a large and active county\r\nsociety, Mrs. Isabel A. Baldwin, president, and city organizations of\r\nwomen of equal ability and prestige, who were in daily communication\r\nwith State headquarters and performed the most valuable and\r\nconscientious work. What was true here was equally so of the women in\r\nall the counties from San Diego to Del Norte. It seems invidious to\r\nmention a single name where so many gave such excellent service. It must\r\nbe admitted, however, that while hundreds of women worked for their\r\npolitical freedom, thousands contributed absolutely nothing in either\r\nmoney or service; and yet there were many among them who believed fully\r\nin the principle of woman suffrage. They simply allowed domestic duties\r\nor the demands of society or apathetic indifference to prevent their\r\nrendering any assistance, and they could not be prevailed upon even to\r\ngive money to help those who performed the labor. If all such had lent\r\ntheir influence, the women of California today would be enfranchised;\r\nbut they left the whole burden to be carried by the few, and these could\r\nnot do the work necessary for success, because human nature has its\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the press of California deserves especial mention\r\nbecause to it was largely due the marked consideration which the\r\nsuffrage amendment received throughout the State. Miss Anthony met in\r\nCalifornia an acquaintance, Mrs. Ida H. Harper, recently of the\r\neditorial staff of the Indianapolis News, and requested her to act as\r\nchairman of the press committee. As the press of San Francisco could\r\nkill the amendment at the very start, if it chose to do so, they decided\r\nto call upon the editors of the daily papers in that city and ascertain\r\ntheir position. They visited the managing editors of the Call, Examiner,\r\nChronicle, Post, Report and Bulletin and, without a single exception,\r\nwere received with the greatest courtesy and assured that the amendment\r\nand the ladies who were advocating it would be treated with respect,\r\nthat there would be no ridiculing, no cartooning and no attempt to\r\ncreate a sentiment in opposition.\r\n\r\nThe Post came out editorially in favor of the amendment and established\r\na half-page department, headed \"The New Citizen,\" which was continued\r\ndaily during the campaign, the largest amount of space ever given by any\r\npaper to woman suffrage. Dr. Elizabeth Sargent assumed most of the\r\nresponsibility for this department, assisted by members of the staff.\r\nThe Report gave editorial endorsement and a double-column department\r\nentitled \"The Woman Citizen,\" edited every Saturday by Winnifred Harper.\r\nThe Bulletin expressed itself as friendly and later in the campaign\r\nopened a suffrage department conducted by Eliza D. Keith; but the paper\r\ncontained editorials from time to time, which the friends did not\r\nconstrue as favorable to the measure. The managing editor gave the\r\nladies to understand that there would be no opposition from the\r\nChronicle, and during the campaign it contained several strong\r\neditorials, not advocating the amendment, but decidedly favorable to\r\nwoman suffrage. This paper also gave a prominent place to a number of\r\narticles from Mrs. Harper and others. Two days before election, however,\r\nit advised its readers to vote against the amendment.\r\n\r\nThe Examiner was friendly and offered a column on the editorial page of\r\nthe Sunday edition, throughout the campaign if Miss Anthony would fill\r\nit. She protested that she was not a writer, but it was only upon this\r\ncondition that the space would be given. It was too valuable to be\r\nsacrificed and so she accepted it, and for seven months furnished Sunday\r\narticles of 1,600 words. These were widely copied, not only throughout\r\nthe State, but in all parts of the country. Every possible influence was\r\nexerted to persuade William R. Hearst, the proprietor, who was residing\r\nin New York, to bring out the paper editorially in favor of the\r\namendment. Miss Anthony wrote an earnest personal letter which closed:\r\n\"So, I pray you for the love of justice, for the love of your noble\r\nmother, and for the sake of California--lead the way for the Democratic\r\nparty of your State to advocate the suffrage amendment. The Examiner has\r\ndone splendidly thus far in publishing fair and full reports of our\r\nmeetings and articles from our leading suffrage women. The one and only\r\nthing we do ask is that it will editorially champion the amendment as it\r\nwill every other measure it believes in which is to be voted upon next\r\nNovember.\" All pleadings were in vain and the great paper remained\r\nsilent. It did not, however, contain a line in opposition.\r\n\r\nDuring Miss Anthony's visit to San Francisco the previous year, the\r\nMonitor, the official Catholic organ of California, had come out in two\r\neditions with full-page editorials in favor of woman suffrage, as strong\r\nas anything ever written on that subject. When the two ladies called on\r\nthe editor, he assured them of his full sympathy and agreed to accept a\r\nseries of articles from the chairman of the press committee. These were\r\npublished regularly for a time and then suddenly were refused, and every\r\neffort to ascertain the reason was unsuccessful. Miss Anthony called on\r\nhim several times and waited for half an hour in his anteroom, but he\r\ndeclined to see her and, during the remainder of the campaign, the\r\namendment received no recognition from the Monitor.\r\n\r\nThe response from the other papers of the State was most remarkable. The\r\nPopulist press, without exception, was for woman suffrage. Every\r\nnewspaper in Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley spoke in favor of the\r\namendment. The majority of those in Los Angeles and San Diego counties\r\nendorsed it. All but one in San Jose, and all but one in Sacramento, did\r\nlikewise. Before the campaign closed, 250 newspapers declared\r\neditorially for the suffrage amendment. Only two of prominence in the\r\nentire State came out boldly in opposition, the Record-Union, of\r\nSacramento, and the Times of Los Angeles. The former ceased its\r\nopposition some time before election; the latter continued to the end,\r\nridiculing, misrepresenting, denouncing, and even going to the extent of\r\ngrossly caricaturing Miss Anthony.\r\n\r\nThe Star, the Voice of Labor and other prominent journals published in\r\nthe interests of the wage-earning classes; those conducted by the\r\ncolored people; the Spanish, French and Italian papers; the leading\r\nJewish papers; the temperance, the A. P. A. and the Socialist organs;\r\nand many published for individual enterprises, agriculture, insurance,\r\netc., spoke strongly for the amendment. The firm which supplied plate\r\nmatter to hundreds of the smaller papers accepted a short article every\r\nweek. There were very few newspapers in the State which did not grant\r\nspace for woman suffrage departments, and these were ably edited by the\r\nwomen of the different localities. Matter on this question was furnished\r\nto the chairman of the press committee by the San Francisco Clipping\r\nBureau, and these clippings were carefully tabulated and filed. At the\r\nclose of the eight months' campaign they numbered 9,000, taken from the\r\npress of California alone. Twenty-seven papers came out in opposition;\r\nthese included a number of San Francisco weeklies of a sensational\r\ncharacter and a few published in small towns.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, in this connection, that the woman suffrage\r\norganization had not a dollar to pay for newspaper influence, had no\r\nadvertising to bestow, and that even the notices for meetings were\r\ngratuitous. All this advocacy on the part of the papers was purely a\r\nfree-will offering and represented the honest and courageous sentiments\r\nof the editors. It is deemed especially worthy of notice because there\r\nwas never anything like it in previous suffrage campaigns. Toward the\r\nend, when the influence of the opposition began to do its fatal work,\r\nthese papers were closely watched and in not one instance was there a\r\ndefection.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this splendid support of the press, Miss Anthony was\r\nfirm in her decision that she would not remain through the campaign\r\nunless the amendment could secure the endorsement of the political\r\nparties, and every energy was directed toward this point. Several of the\r\nRepublican county conventions declared for it, and a number of\r\nRepublican leaders who were visited, announced themselves in favor of\r\nthe plank. The State Convention was to be held May 5. On May 3, the\r\nSunday edition of the San Francisco Call, the largest and most\r\ninfluential Republican paper in the State, came out with flaming\r\nheadlines declaring boldly and unequivocally for woman suffrage! The\r\nsensation created was tremendous, and amendment stock went up above par.\r\nThe Monday and Tuesday editions continued the editorial endorsement,\r\ndeclaring that the Republican party stood committed to woman suffrage,\r\nand that the Call constituted itself the champion and would carry it to\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nTuesday morning the Republican convention opened at Sacramento. The\r\nwoman suffrage delegation, consisting of Mrs. Sargent, Mrs. John F.\r\nSwift, Mrs. Blinn, Mrs. Austin Sperry, Mrs. Knox Goodrich, Miss Anthony,\r\nRev. Anna Shaw, Miss Hay, Miss Yates, Mrs. Harper, opened their\r\nheadquarters at the Golden Eagle Hotel, decorated their parlor with\r\nflowers, spread out their literature and badges and waited for the\r\ndelegates. They had not long to wait. With the influence of the Sunday\r\nCall, a copy of which had been laid on the seat of every delegate in the\r\nconvention hall, they had a prestige which found favor in the eyes of\r\nthe politicians. The visitors came early and stayed late; they went away\r\nand returned bringing their friends to be converted. The Call account\r\nsaid: \"They went in twos and threes, in large groups and in entire\r\ndelegations, to pay homage to their more modest workers and apparently\r\nto beg the privilege of serving them.\" The rooms were crowded until\r\nafter midnight.\r\n\r\nThe delegates put on the badges, and when the convention opened 250 of\r\nthem were wearing the little flag with its three stars. The ladies were\r\ngiven the best seats in the great building. The delegates were divided\r\ninto two hostile camps, representing opposite wings of the party, and\r\nthe women had to move very carefully, as it was by no means certain\r\nwhich faction would secure control of the convention. They also had to\r\nframe many non-committal answers to the question, \"How do you stand on\r\nthe A. P. A.?\" The headquarters were thronged with reporters; every\r\nwoman was interviewed at length and her opinions telegraphed to the\r\ngreat San Francisco dailies. Miss Anthony's interviews occupied a column\r\nin the Examiner, each day of the convention. Those alarmists who fear\r\nwomen will lose the respect of men when they are invested with political\r\ninfluence should have had this object lesson.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the convention was considered not favorable to woman\r\nsuffrage. Of the seven men appointed on the resolution committee, five\r\nwere said to be opposed to the plank. The spirits of the ladies began to\r\ndroop. In the evening permission was given them to address the platform\r\ncommittee. Mrs. Harper wrote the San Francisco Call:\r\n\r\n     I wish I could picture that scene. In the small room, seated around\r\n     the table, were the seven men who held the fate of this question in\r\n     their hands. At one end stood Miss Anthony, the light from above\r\n     shining upon her silver hair until it seemed like a halo, and she\r\n     spoke as no one ever heard her speak before. On the face of every\r\n     delegate was an expression of the deepest seriousness, and before\r\n     she had finished tears were in the eyes of more than one. She was\r\n     followed by Miss Shaw, who stood there the embodiment of all that\r\n     is pure, sweet and womanly, and in a low, clear voice presented the\r\n     subject as no one else could have done. As we were about to leave\r\n     the room, the chairman said, \"Ladies, we will take the vote now, if\r\n     you desire.\" We thanked him, but said no, we would withdraw and\r\n     leave them to consider the matter at their leisure.\r\n\r\n     Within a very few minutes we had their decision--six in favor of\r\n     the resolution and one opposed. Here I want to call attention to\r\n     one thing. Eight women knew of the favorable action of the\r\n     committee by 9 o'clock, but although we were besieged by reporters\r\n     and delegates until nearly midnight we gave no sign, and the\r\n     Wednesday morning papers could only say that it was probable there\r\n     would be a woman suffrage plank. It is charged that women can not\r\n     keep a secret, but this is one of those many ancient myths which\r\n     take a long time to die.\r\n\r\nThe plank was adopted next day in the big convention with only one\r\ndissenting voice. The Woman's Congress was in session at San Francisco\r\nand when Mrs. Cooper, its president, stepped forward on the platform and\r\nread the telegram announcing the result, the enthusiasm hardly can be\r\ndescribed. The ladies went down from Sacramento to the Congress the next\r\nday and received a continuous ovation throughout the rest of the\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\nAmong the pleasant letters which came to Miss Anthony was one from\r\nAbigail Scott Duniway, of Portland, Ore., in which she said: \"Your\r\ntriumphs in California are marvellous. Hurrah, and again, hurrah! I\r\nbelieve now the women of the Golden State will win. All honor to you and\r\nyour noble confreres!\" And one from Lucy Underwood McCann, of Santa\r\nCruz, saying: \"It is to you, most honored and revered of women, we owe\r\nthe fact, because of your long martyrdom in this great reform, that we\r\nstand now, as we hope and pray, upon the brink of realization of our\r\nrights. This has been made possible only through the patient toil of\r\nsuch heroic souls as your own. Your wisdom in planning this campaign, in\r\nwhich we confidently expect a glorious victory, is our mainstay, upon\r\nwhich all other hopes depend.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony's happiness over the action of the Republicans knew no\r\nbounds, and she began with renewed courage to prepare for the Populist\r\nconvention May 12. The prominent Populists who were visited assured the\r\nladies that they need not waste time or money going to Sacramento to\r\nsecure a plank in their platform, as woman suffrage was one of the\r\nfundamental principles of their party. The suffrage leaders felt,\r\nhowever, that this convention was entitled to the same courtesy as the\r\nothers and they attended in a body, headed by Miss Anthony and Mrs.\r\nSargent. When they entered the convention hall they were received with\r\ncheers and waving of hats, escorted to the front seats, invited to\r\naddress the convention and surrounded by delegates during the recess.\r\nWithout any solicitation the resolution committee reported and the\r\nconvention adopted a strong woman suffrage plank, and then gave three\r\ncheers for the ladies. They were told that not half a dozen men in that\r\nbody were opposed to the amendment.\r\n\r\nFrom here they went to the Prohibition convention at Stockton, were met\r\nat the station by a delegation of ladies, and received with\r\ndistinguished consideration by the convention. Miss Anthony was twice\r\ninvited to address them, and the plank endorsing the amendment was\r\nadopted by a hearty and unanimous vote. A reception was then held at the\r\nhotel and over a hundred ladies called.\r\n\r\nOne convention yet remained, the Democratic. While a few of the leaders\r\nof this party were in favor of the amendment, most of them were opposed\r\nand gave no encouragement to the attempt to secure a plank. The ladies,\r\nhowever, carried out the program, and the same large delegation returned\r\nto Sacramento June 16, the number increased by Mrs. Cooper, Mrs. E. O.\r\nSmith, of San Jose, Mrs. Alice M. Stocker, of Pleasanton, and several\r\nothers. A month had intervened and the opposition had had time to\r\norganize. Some of the county conventions had declared against the\r\namendment and many of the delegates had been instructed to vote against\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage representatives were disappointed in the hope that they\r\nmight come to this convention with the editorial endorsement of the\r\nExaminer, but they were greatly pleased to receive from that paper, on\r\nthe morning of the opening, a package of 2,000 woman suffrage leaflets.\r\nThe Examiner had collected at its own expense a large amount of fresh\r\nand valuable testimony from the leading editors and officials of\r\nColorado and Wyoming, as to its satisfactory practical working in those\r\nStates, and had arranged it in large type on heavy cream-tinted paper,\r\nmaking the handsomest leaflet of the kind ever issued. These were placed\r\nin the hands of the delegates, and also distributed throughout the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe women's headquarters at the Golden Eagle were practically unvisited.\r\nA few lone delegates, and two or three delegations that had been\r\ninstructed to vote for the amendment, strayed up to express their\r\nsympathy, but most of them were too well subjugated by the political\r\nbosses even to pay a visit of courtesy. A new element was introduced\r\nhere in the person of a woman of somewhat unpleasant record who claimed\r\nto be the representative of the anti-suffrage organization. The platform\r\ncommittee consisted of thirty-five and met in a large room filled with\r\nspectators. The ladies presented a petition signed by 40,000 California\r\nmen and women asking for woman suffrage. The entire delegation of\r\nspeakers, with Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw at the head, was granted\r\ntwenty minutes to present its claims, and the one woman above referred\r\nto was given the same amount of time. She did not occupy more than a\r\nminute of it, simply saying that her anti-suffrage league was going to\r\norganize all over the State and work for the Democratic party. The\r\nresolution was laid on the table, almost before they were out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nA minority report was prepared by Charles Wesley Reed, of San Francisco,\r\nand signed by himself, Mr. Alford, chairman of the committee, and two\r\nothers. In a letter to the Call, Mrs. Harper thus describes subsequent\r\nevents:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Reed assured the ladies that he would bring this report before\r\n     the convention and he kept his word, although he had other fights\r\n     on hand and endangered them by standing for woman suffrage. This\r\n     minority report, although properly drawn and signed by four members\r\n     of the platform committee, including the chairman, was \"smothered\"\r\n     by the secretary of the convention and its chairman, Mr. Frank\r\n     Gould. Every other minority report was read and acted upon by the\r\n     convention; that alone on woman suffrage was held back. In vain Mr.\r\n     Reed protested; the chairman ignored him and called for a vote on\r\n     the platform as a whole. It was adopted with a roar, and our fight\r\n     was lost! It was near midnight. We had sat two long hot days in the\r\n     convention, had slept but little, were worn out and very, very\r\n     wrathy. At this juncture John P. Irish addressed the convention,\r\n     stating that a distinguished lady was present, etc., and would they\r\n     hear Miss Susan B. Anthony? Thinking it was too late for her to do\r\n     any harm, she was received with loud applause.\r\n\r\n     It was impossible to say what the convention expected, but they got\r\n     a rebuke for allowing such action on the part of their chairman and\r\n     for treating the women of the State in this unjust and undemocratic\r\n     manner, which caused a hush to fall upon the whole body. It was a\r\n     dramatic and impressive scene, one not to be forgotten. At its\r\n     conclusion there were loud cries for Anna Shaw. The little fighter\r\n     was at the boiling point, but she stepped upon the platform with a\r\n     smile, and with that sarcasm of which she is complete master\r\n     supplemented Miss Anthony's remarks. As she stepped down, half the\r\n     convention were on their feet demanding the minority report. The\r\n     chairman stated that it was too late for that, but a resolution\r\n     might be offered. The original resolution was at once presented,\r\n     and then there was an attempt to take a viva-voce vote, but our\r\n     friends demanded a roll-call. It resulted in 149 ayes and 420 noes.\r\n     Mr. Gould's own county voted almost solidly in favor. Alameda\r\n     county, led by W. W. Foote, gave 32 noes and 3 ayes, yet this\r\n     county sent in the largest petition for woman suffrage of any in\r\n     the State.\r\n\r\nTo secure more than a one-fourth vote of a convention which had been\r\ndetermined not to allow the question even to come before it, was not a\r\ntotal defeat.[119]\r\n\r\nThe battle was now fairly begun and it grew hotter with every passing\r\nweek for the next five months. A few days after the last convention the\r\nwomen held a mass meeting in Metropolitan Temple to ratify the planks.\r\nThe great hall was crowded to the doors and hundreds stood during all\r\nthe long exercises. As the ladies who had been to the conventions came\r\nupon the stage, the building fairly rang with applause. The Republican,\r\nPopulist, Prohibition, Democratic and Socialist-Labor parties were\r\nrepresented by prominent men who made strong suffrage speeches.\r\nCongressman James G. Maguire spoke for those individual Democrats who\r\nbelieved in woman suffrage, among whom he was always a staunch\r\nadvocate. Miss Anthony was cheered to the echo and it seemed as if the\r\naudience could not get enough of her bright, pithy remarks, as she\r\nintroduced the different speakers.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage advocates, elated with their victory in three conventions,\r\nopened headquarters in the large new Parrott building and swung their\r\nbanner across the street.[120] Five rooms were filled with busy workers\r\ndirected by Mary G. Hay, chairman of the State central committee, while\r\nthe other members took turns in receiving the reporters, the people on\r\nbusiness and the throngs of visitors from all parts of the State. To\r\nfollow this campaign in detail, to name all of those most prominently\r\nconnected with it, would be obviously impracticable. It would be utterly\r\nimpossible to mention individually the hundreds of women who thoroughly\r\ncanvassed their own precincts and deserve a full share of the credit for\r\nthe large vote cast. A number of competent California women took up the\r\norganization of the different counties. Every woman in the State who\r\ncould address an audience found her place and work. Mrs. Alice Moore\r\nMcComas and Rev. Mila Tupper Maynard headed the list of Southern\r\nCalifornia speakers. Miss Sarah M. Severance spoke under the auspices of\r\nthe W. C. T. U. Mrs. Naomi Anderson represented the colored women. Rev.\r\nAnna Shaw spoke every night during the campaign, except the one month\r\nwhen she returned East to fill engagements. She paid the salary of her\r\nsecretary and donated her services to the headquarters for five months.\r\nMiss Elizabeth Upham Yates, of Maine, made about one hundred speeches.\r\nThe last two months Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, national organizer, gave\r\nseveral addresses each day. There were very few men who worked as hard\r\nduring that campaign as did scores of the women, each according to her\r\nability.\r\n\r\nNo description could give an adequate idea of the amount of labor\r\nperformed by Miss Anthony during those eight months. There was scarcely\r\na day, including Sundays, that she did not make from one to three\r\nspeeches, often having a long journey between them. She addressed great\r\npolitical rallies of thousands of people; church conventions of every\r\ndenomination; Spiritualist and Freethinkers' gatherings; Salvation Army\r\nmeetings; African societies; Socialists; all kinds of labor\r\norganizations; granges; Army and Navy Leagues; Soldiers' Homes and\r\nmilitary encampments; women's clubs and men's clubs; Y. M. C. A.'s and\r\nW. C. T. U.'s. She spoke at farmers' picnics on the mountaintops, and\r\nBethel Missions in the cellars of San Francisco; at parlor meetings in\r\nthe most elegant homes; and in pool-rooms where there was printed on the\r\nblackboard, \"Welcome to Susan B. Anthony.\"\r\n\r\nShe was in constant demand for social functions, where her presence gave\r\nan opportunity for a discussion of the all-absorbing question. One of\r\nthe handsomest of these was a breakfast of two hundred covers, given by\r\nthe Century Club in the \"maple room\" of the Palace Hotel, where were\r\ngathered the leading women of San Francisco and other cities in the\r\nState. Miss Anthony sat at the right hand of the president and responded\r\nto the toast, \"Those who break bread with us.\" The club privileges were\r\nextended to her and, at the close of the campaign, she was made an\r\nhonorary member. This club was composed largely of conservative women,\r\nbut its president, Mrs. Mary Wood Swift, was one of the most prominent\r\nof the suffrage advocates. She addressed the Woman's Press Association,\r\nthe Laurel Hall Club, the Forum, Sorosis, Association of Collegiate\r\nAlumnæ and most of the other women's organizations of San Francisco. An\r\ninvitation to luncheon was received from Mrs. Stanford signed, \"Your\r\nsincere friend and believer in woman suffrage,\" and a very pleasant day\r\nwas spent in her lovely home at Menlo Park.\r\n\r\nA breakfast was given in her honor by the Ebell Club of Oakland, Mrs. G.\r\nW. Bunnell, president. She rode in a beautifully decorated carriage at\r\nthe great Fabiola Fête, or floral festival, held annually in this city.\r\nMany social courtesies were extended in the towns around the bay, among\r\nthem being dinner parties by Senator and Mrs. Fred Stratton, Mr. and\r\nMrs. A. A. Moore, Mrs. Henry Vrooman, Mr. and Mrs. F. M. Smith, Mrs.\r\nEmma Shafter Howard, Mr. and Mrs. F. C. Havens, Mrs. Alice H. Wellman,\r\nof Oakland; Judge and Mrs. J. A. Waymire, of Alameda; Mr. and Mrs.\r\nWilliam A. Keith, of Berkeley. All this would have been very enjoyable\r\nbut for the fact that most of these occasions included a speech, and she\r\nwas usually obliged to come from just having spoken, or to rush away to\r\nkeep another engagement. One unique experience was a complimentary trip\r\ntendered, through Mrs. Lovell White, by the proprietors of the new Mill\r\nValley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railway, to Miss Anthony and a large\r\nnumber of guests. From the top of this high peak, which overlooks the\r\nGolden Gate, they enjoyed a view that for beauty and grandeur is not\r\nsurpassed in the world.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony visited also various towns throughout the central part of\r\nthe State and along the coast, speaking in wigwams, halls, churches,\r\nschoolhouses and the open air, taking trains at all hours, travelling\r\nthrough heat and dust, wind and cold; and there was never a word of\r\ncomplaint during all the long campaign. She was always ready to go,\r\nalways on time, always full of cheer and hope.\r\n\r\nThe first week in June she went to Portland to attend the Woman's\r\nCongress, Abigail Scott Duniway, president. Its officers were among the\r\nprominent women of the city, and she was royally received. She spoke a\r\nnumber of times during the nine sessions and was handsomely treated by\r\nthe press. Sarah B. Cooper joined her here, on her way home from the\r\nNational Federation of Clubs at Louisville, Ky. A number of receptions\r\nwere given in their honor, among them one by the Woman's Club. There was\r\nan elaborate luncheon at \"the Curtis;\" and a reception was tendered by\r\nthe managers of the Woman's Union. No effort was spared to make their\r\nvisit in everyday delightful. Miss Anthony lectured in the opera house\r\nat Seattle under the auspices of the Woman's Century Club, and a\r\nreception was given by her hostess, Mrs. Kate Turner Holmes. Many\r\ninducements were offered for her to extend the visit, but she was\r\ndesirous of returning to the field of work in California at the earliest\r\npossible moment and was absent only nine days.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was invited by both Republican and Populist managers to\r\naddress their ratification meetings in San Francisco, and received an\r\novation from the great audiences representing the two parties. One wing\r\nof the Democrats held their ratification meeting after night in the open\r\nair and of course she was not invited to speak, but the other wing\r\nextended a cordial invitation and she addressed them in Metropolitan\r\nTemple, receiving an enthusiastic greeting. The suffrage women\r\nthemselves held a second mass meeting September 10, according to the\r\nCall, \"amid a mighty outburst of popular enthusiasm, the like of which\r\nhas seldom if ever been seen at a political meeting held in this city.\"\r\nHere again the part taken by prominent men from all political parties\r\ndemonstrated the non-partisan character of the woman's campaign. This\r\nwas Mrs. Catt's first appearance before a California audience and the\r\npapers said: \"As she and the other ladies delivered their clear-cut,\r\nlogical speeches, cheers rent the air and handkerchiefs and hats were\r\nwaved with overmastering enthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the months went by, with their cares and pleasures, their hopes\r\nand fears, their elation and depression. In her letters to her sister,\r\nMiss Anthony wrote: \"Sometimes I have a homesick hour and feel as if I\r\nmust leave all and rush back to my own hearthstone, but then I pull\r\nmyself together and resolve to go through to the end.\" A similar\r\ncampaign was in progress in Idaho and Mrs. Catt was there in August at\r\nthe request of that State board, to represent the national association.\r\nThey were very anxious that Miss Anthony should come also, but to their\r\nmany letters she replied:\r\n\r\n     I should love dearly to go to Boise at once, as you request, and I\r\n     should have been in Idaho during the last two months had it been\r\n     possible for one human being to be in two places at the same\r\n     time.... I learn that the men who believe in suffrage in your\r\n     State, object to an open demand for party endorsement, but prefer a\r\n     \"still hunt.\" I have seen this tried before, but our opponents\r\n     always can make a stiller hunt. Our only hope of success lies in\r\n     open, free and full discussions through the newspapers and\r\n     political party speakers.... Won't it be a magnificent feather in\r\n     our cap if we get both California and Idaho into the fold this\r\n     year? How beautiful the blue field will look with two more\r\n     stars--five little gold stars! Remember that the woman suffrage\r\n     stars are gold, not silver. Not that I think gold is better than\r\n     silver, but it is a different color from the forty-five on the\r\n     regular flag.[121]\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, some misrepresentations, both intentional and\r\nunintentional, of Miss Anthony's attitude. The fact of her speaking on\r\nthe platforms of all political parties was something which many people\r\ncould not comprehend, and the party organs could not refrain from\r\ntwisting her remarks a little bit in the direction of their doctrines;\r\nthen would come a storm of protests from the other side, and she would\r\nhave to explain what she actually said. Thus, with the reporters\r\nconstantly at her elbow, the public watching every utterance and the\r\npoliticians on the alert to discover what party she and her\r\nfellow-workers really did favor, she lived indeed for many months in\r\n\"the fierce light that beats upon a throne.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, that I had you by my side; what a team we would make!\" she often\r\nwrote to Mrs. Stanton, who answered: \"I read all the papers you send and\r\nwatch closely the progress of the campaign. I feel at times as if I\r\nshould fly to your help. We are the only class in history that has been\r\nleft to fight its battles alone, unaided by the ruling powers. White\r\nlabor and the freed black men had their champions, but where are ours?\"\r\n\r\nIn June the National Republican Convention was held at St. Louis. Miss\r\nAnthony could not make the long journey but she sent the following\r\nresolution and asked its adoption: \"The Republican Party in national\r\nconvention assembled hereby recommends that Congress shall submit an\r\namendment to the Federal Constitution providing that the right of\r\ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by\r\nthe United States, or by any State, on account of sex.\"\r\n\r\nThe platform committee labored and this is what it brought forth: \"The\r\nRepublican party is mindful of the rights and interests of women.\r\nProtection of American industries includes equal opportunities, equal\r\npay for equal work, and protection to the home. We favor the admission\r\nof women to wider spheres of usefulness, and welcome their co-operation\r\nin rescuing the country from Democratic mismanagement and Populist\r\nmisrule.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony's indignation, anger and contempt when she read this\r\nresolution can not be put into words. It required the combined efforts\r\nof those who were nearest her to prevent the expression of her opinion\r\nin reply to the many reporters and letters wanting to know how she\r\nregarded this plank. \"You must not offend the Republicans and injure our\r\namendment,\" they argued, and she would acquiesce and subside. Then,\r\nafter thinking it over, she would again burst forth and declare the\r\nwomen of the country should not be compelled to submit to this insult\r\nwithout a protest from her. \"Women want the suffrage as a sword to smite\r\ndown Democratic and Populist misrule. Infamous!\" she exclaimed again and\r\nagain. \"That climaxes all the outrages ever offered to women in the\r\nhistory of political platforms.\" To Mrs. Stanton she wrote: \"O, that you\r\nwere young and strong and free, and could fire off of the planet such\r\nineffable slush as is being slobbered over our cause!\" But she held her\r\npeace, and all the brainy women who were conducting this great campaign\r\nkept silent, although there was not one of them who did not feel exactly\r\nlike Miss Anthony in regard to this plank. Nor was there a woman in the\r\ncountry, who was able to comprehend the resolution, that did not regard\r\nit as an insult and feel that she would prefer never again to have women\r\nmentioned in a national platform if the men who should make it had no\r\nhigher conception of justice than this.\r\n\r\nOn October 11, Miss Anthony started on a southern tour, speaking first\r\nat San Luis Obispo to an audience which crowded the hall. From here to\r\nSanta Barbara, through the courtesy of Superintendent Johnson, of the\r\nnarrow gauge railroad, the train was stopped at every station for a\r\nten-minute address. At some places a stage had been extemporized, at\r\nothers she spoke from the rear platform of the car. Her coming had been\r\nannounced and, even in those rather thinly settled regions, there would\r\nbe as many as a thousand people gathered at the station. When she\r\nconcluded, quantities of flowers would be thrown in her pathway and the\r\nplatform literally banked with them.[122] After a stage ride of forty\r\nmiles she received an enthusiastic welcome at Santa Barbara, where she\r\nwas the guest of Dr. Ida Stambach. The ovation was continued at all the\r\ntowns visited in the southern part of the State.\r\n\r\nA little flurry had been caused early in the campaign by the\r\nannouncement that the National W. C. T. U. Convention would be held in\r\nSan Francisco during the autumn of 1896. Miss Anthony had written Miss\r\nWillard that she thought this would be very injudicious. She then had\r\nagreed to postpone it until after the election, and Miss Anthony again\r\nhad objected, saying:\r\n\r\n     I am glad you think it will be possible to postpone your convention\r\n     to November; but, you see, even to do that all California will be\r\n     full of your advertisements, and the papers all telling how the W.\r\n     C. T. U. is going to bring its convention to San Francisco\r\n     immediately after the women have the right to vote, so as to\r\n     educate them to destroy the wine-growing and brandy-distilling\r\n     business; in other words, that it is going to start in the first\r\n     thing to ruin what today is the one means of livelihood for immense\r\n     numbers of ranchmen throughout the State. So, I hope--nay, I\r\n     beseech that you will withdraw the convention altogether from\r\n     California for this year. I have had letters from the amendment\r\n     campaign committee, and every one of them deplores the coming of\r\n     the convention....\r\n\r\n     Now, my dear, hold your convention any place but in a State where\r\n     we are trying to persuade every license man, every wine-grower,\r\n     every drinker and every one who does not believe in prohibition,\r\n     as well as every one who does, to vote \"yes\" on the woman suffrage\r\n     question. If you only will do this, I am sure you will do the most\r\n     effective work in the power of any mortal to secure the end we all\r\n     so much desire.\r\n\r\nMiss Willard replied in a cordial letter that she had not the slightest\r\nwish to antagonize her or the suffrage movement and would use her\r\ninfluence to have the place of the convention changed. To Mrs. B.\r\nSturtevant Peet, president of the California W. C. T. U., who was\r\nsomewhat in doubt as to the necessity for such change, Miss Anthony\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     What you say of the good influence of your national convention in\r\n     San Francisco is true so far as concerns the actual Prohibition\r\n     men; but we must consider those who are making their daily bread\r\n     out of the manufacture as well as the sale of liquors. There are\r\n     many excellent men in California who are not total abstainers, but\r\n     who believe in wine as the people of Italy and France believe in\r\n     it; and I think that, in waging our campaign, we should be careful\r\n     not to run against the prejudices or the pecuniary interests of\r\n     that class. As I have said before, if it were a Prohibition\r\n     amendment which was pending I should think it exceedingly unwise to\r\n     run that campaign under the banner of woman suffrage. The average\r\n     human mind is incapable of taking in more than one idea at a time.\r\n     The one we want to get into the heads of the voters this year is\r\n     woman's enfranchisement, and we must pull every string with every\r\n     possible individual man and class of men to secure their votes for\r\n     this amendment. We should be extremely careful to base all our\r\n     arguments upon the right of every individual to have his or her\r\n     opinion counted at the ballot-box, whether it is in accordance with\r\n     ours or not. Therefore, the amendment must not be urged as a\r\n     measure for temperance, social purity, or any other reform, but\r\n     simply as a measure to give to women the right to vote yea or nay\r\n     on each and all of them. I want every woman in California to work\r\n     for the amendment, but I want her to work in the name of suffrage,\r\n     not of prohibition.\r\n\r\nThe national convention was withdrawn entirely from California, and the\r\nW. C. T. U. women, in most places, worked under the one banner of the\r\nsuffrage amendment during the campaign. In proof that there was no\r\nfeeling on the part of the leaders against Miss Anthony, it may be\r\nstated that she received official invitations to be present at the\r\nbirthday celebration of Mrs. Peet, in April; to address the State W. C.\r\nT. U. Convention at Petaluma, in October; to attend the National\r\nConvention at St. Louis in November; and to join in the farewell\r\nreception to Miss Willard in New York on the eve of her departure for\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe managers of the woman's campaign supposed of course that the\r\nendorsement by the Populist and Republican State Conventions meant not\r\nonly that the speakers of those parties would advocate the suffrage\r\nplank just as they did the others in their respective platforms, but\r\nthat they also would permit the women themselves to speak for it in\r\ntheir political meetings. When they applied to Mr. Wardall and the other\r\nmembers of the Populist Central Committee, the schedule was promptly\r\nfurnished and they were assured that their speakers would be welcomed.\r\nWhen they applied to the Republican Central Committee, to their\r\namazement, they were put off with an evasive answer. Meanwhile they had\r\nMiss Anthony, Miss Shaw, Mrs. Catt and other speakers waiting for\r\nengagements and did not dare make dates ahead lest it might interfere\r\nwith the big Republican rallies which they wished them to address. Again\r\nand again they went to the Republican Central Committee and asked for\r\nthe schedule of their meetings and the privilege of sending their\r\nspeakers to them. Finally, after weeks of anxious waiting, the chairman,\r\nMajor Frank McLaughlin, sent a letter to the suffrage headquarters\r\nsaying in effect: \"The committee had decided not to grant this\r\nprivilege; in the language used at one time by Miss Anthony, it meant\r\n'too many bonnets at their meetings,' and they wished to reach the\r\nvoters.\"\r\n\r\nHe added that they were at liberty to make any arrangements they chose\r\nwith the county chairmen. This meant, of course, that they must\r\nascertain the name and address of every county chairman in the State,\r\nwatch the papers for the announcements of meetings, hold their speakers\r\nin reserve, and beg the privilege of having them heard. All this, when\r\nthe endorsement of the suffrage amendment was the first plank in the\r\nRepublican platform unanimously adopted by the State convention! There\r\nwas nothing, however, except to make the best of it; but when they\r\nattempted to arrange with the county chairmen, they found Major\r\nMcLaughlin had written them not to allow the women speakers on their\r\nplatforms! While many of them refused to obey his orders, he had\r\npractically destroyed the best opportunity for reaching the people.\r\n\r\nThe Republican State Convention had enthusiastically adopted a\r\nresolution declaring for \"the free coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to\r\n1.\" When the National Convention met in St. Louis soon afterwards it\r\nadopted a gold standard plank, and there they were! The Populists and\r\nDemocrats who agreed on a financial plank saw here an opportunity and,\r\nin many counties, effected a fusion and held their meetings together.\r\nThis, of course, nullified the permission given the women to put\r\nspeakers on the Populist platform, since the Democrats, as a party, were\r\nopposed to woman suffrage, and there they were! If they attempted to\r\nhold simply suffrage meetings, they could get only audiences of women,\r\nbecause all the men were in attendance at the political rallies. So the\r\nonly thing left was for the women in every city and town in the State,\r\nwhenever a political mass meeting was advertised, to go to the managers\r\nand humbly beg to have one of their speakers on the platform.\r\n\r\nThis was not often refused, and it was just as easy to get this\r\npermission from Democrats as from Republicans. The former felt that if\r\nthe amendment should carry they would not object to a little of the\r\ncredit, and they soon found also that the women were a drawing card.\r\nWhenever there was a purely Populist meeting, a conspicuous place and\r\nall the time desired were given to the women, but at Republican,\r\nDemocratic or Fusion meetings, they always were placed at the end of the\r\nprogram and allowed only five or, at most, ten minutes. In order simply\r\nto get this little word, the women speakers would make long journeys and\r\nsit on the platform until every long-winded male orator had finished his\r\nspeech, and until they were ready to drop from their chairs. But the\r\naudience waited for them, no matter how late, and never failed to\r\nreceive them with the wildest enthusiasm. Many times when the managers\r\nwould have been willing to sandwich them between other speakers, the\r\nlatter would object, saying the people would go home as soon as the\r\nwomen had finished!\r\n\r\nAs the campaign wore on it became a fight for life with the political\r\nparties. The Call, which had come out so valiantly for woman suffrage,\r\nhad been struck in a vital part, i.e., in the counting-room, by the\r\nopponents of this measure, who withdrew valuable advertising and in\r\nevery possible way sought to injure the paper. Its support was used by\r\nthe other wing of the Republican party to create a prejudice against the\r\ncandidates it advocated; the principal stockholders were not friendly to\r\nthe amendment; as the organ of the Central Committee it was deprived of\r\nindependent action. So it was not surprising that, long before the close\r\nof the campaign, the great fight which the Call agreed to make had\r\ndwindled to an occasional skirmish when the pleading of the women grew\r\ntoo strong to be resisted.\r\n\r\nAlmost without exception the Republican orators were silent on the\r\nquestion of woman suffrage, even those who personally favored it. The\r\nwomen wrote them, interviewed them and begged them to advocate the first\r\nplank in their platform as they did all the rest, and occasionally when\r\nthey would go in a body and sit on the front seats to watch the speaker,\r\nhe would say a few mild words in favor of the amendment, but there were\r\nseveral of the Democrats who did as much. Some of the Populists\r\nadvocated it, but the most prominent, who always before had spoken for\r\nit, went through the entire campaign without so much as a mention, in\r\norder to secure Democratic support. When Thomas B. Reed came into the\r\nState, at the very end of the campaign, the women felt sure of an ally,\r\nas he had long been a pronounced advocate, but he did not so much as\r\nrefer to the question in his tour of the State, although they bombarded\r\nhim with letters which would have impressed a heart of stone. At the\r\nlast grand rally in Oakland, the day before election, with Miss Anthony\r\non one side of him and Miss Shaw on the other, he did say that he \"knew\r\nof no more reason why a woman should not vote than why a man should\r\nnot\"--but the battle then was already lost.\r\n\r\nUp to within a few weeks of election, in spite of all the drawbacks, it\r\nlooked as if the amendment would win. The general sentiment throughout\r\nthe State seemed to be in favor. The mere mention of the subject at any\r\nmeeting was received with the greatest enthusiasm. Almost every delegate\r\nbody which assembled in convention during that summer adopted a\r\nresolution of endorsement; this was true of most of the church\r\nconferences, the teachers' institutes, the State Grange and farmers'\r\ninstitutes, the Chautauqua assemblies and countless others. And still\r\nthe women watched and waited! There was one element more powerful than\r\nall these combined, which had not yet shown its hand. It never had\r\nfailed in any State to fight woman suffrage to the death, and there was\r\nno reason to believe it would not kill it in California.\r\n\r\nTen days before election the fatal blow came. The representatives of the\r\nLiquor Dealers' League met in San Francisco and resolved \"to take such\r\nsteps as were necessary to protect their interests.\" The political\r\nleaders, the candidates, the rank and file of the voters recognized the\r\nhandwriting on the wall. From that moment the fate of the amendment was\r\nsealed. The women had determined, from the beginning of the campaign,\r\nthat they would give the liquor business no excuse to say its interests\r\nwere threatened, and therefore the temperance question had been kept out\r\nof the discussion as had the religious, the tariff and the financial\r\nquestions. They took the sensible view that it had no more place than\r\nthese in the demand for women's right to vote as they pleased on all\r\nsubjects. Therefore the action of the liquor dealers had no\r\njustification in anything which the women had said or done. It simply\r\nshowed that they considered woman suffrage a dangerous foe. The\r\nfollowing letter, signed by the wholesale liquor firms of San Francisco,\r\nwas sent to the saloon-keepers, hotel proprietors, druggists and grocers\r\nthroughout the State:\r\n\r\n     At the election to be held on November 3, Constitutional Amendment\r\n     No. Six, which gives the right to vote to women, will be voted on.\r\n\r\n     It is to your interest and ours to vote against this amendment. We\r\n     request and urge you to vote and work against it and do all you can\r\n     to defeat it.\r\n\r\n     See your neighbor in the same line of business as yourself, and\r\n     have him be with you in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe men in the slums of San Francisco were taken in squads and, with\r\nsample ballots, were taught how to put the cross against the suffrage\r\namendment and assured that if it carried there never would be another\r\nglass of beer sold in the city. When the chairman of the press committee\r\nwent to a prominent editor, who was opposed to woman suffrage and knew\r\nthat these things were being done, and asked if there were no way by\r\nwhich some suffrage literature could be given to those men so that they\r\nmight see there was no ground for these threats, he said: \"Most of them\r\ncan not read and if they could the whiskey men would never allow a page\r\nof it to get into their hands.\" In what way the liquor dealers worked\r\nupon the political parties, it is not necessary to speculate. The\r\nmethods were not new and are pretty well understood. They control tens\r\nof thousands of votes not only in California but in every State, which\r\nthey can deliver to either of the great parties that does their bidding\r\nand regards their interests.\r\n\r\nIt is absurd, however, to attribute the defeat of the suffrage amendment\r\nwholly to the liquor dealers, or to the densely ignorant, or to the\r\nforeigners. In the wealthiest and most aristocratic wards of San\r\nFrancisco and Oakland, where there were none of these, the proportion of\r\nvotes against the amendment was just as great as it was in the slum\r\nwards of the two cities. Those respectable, law-abiding citizens who\r\ncast their ballots against the amendment, thereby voted to continue the\r\npower of the above mentioned classes.\r\n\r\nFor weeks before the election, the most frantic efforts were made by the\r\npoliticians to register new voters and colonize them in the wards where\r\nthey would be most needed.[123] Columns of appeals were issued in all\r\nthe newspapers to get the vast numbers of lately arrived immigrants to\r\ncome to the city hall and register. Men were sent around ringing big\r\nbells and calling upon them to do this, and interpreters were employed\r\nto explain that it would not cost them a cent. Finally the registry\r\nbooks were carried to the parks and other places where these men were\r\nemployed, in order to secure their names.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the intelligent, order-loving, sober and industrious women of\r\nthe State were making such efforts as never were made by any class of\r\nmen, to secure this same privilege of placing in the ballot-box and\r\nhaving counted their opinions on questions relating to the public\r\nwelfare;--opinions, one would think, that ought to be considered of as\r\nmuch value to the State as those which such strenuous attempts were\r\nbeing made to obtain. It seems, however, that intelligence, morality and\r\nthrift must wait the pleasure of ignorance, vice and idleness.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of the early spring, through the efforts of a few\r\nwomen who worked without pay and used only their spare moments, the\r\nnames of nearly 30,000 women were secured to a petition asking for the\r\nsuffrage. This, of course, represented only a fraction of those which\r\nmight have been obtained by continued effort, but a petition signed by\r\neven 30,000 men would have been considered worthy of attention. The vast\r\nmajority of women have no money of their own and those who work for\r\nwages, as a rule, receive but a pittance, and yet there were raised in\r\nCalifornia for this amendment campaign almost $19,000, and the amount\r\ncontributed by men was so small as not to be worth mentioning. The\r\nfinancial success was due very largely to the State treasurer, Mrs.\r\nAustin Sperry. She not only made a donation of $500, but borrowed from\r\nthe bank on her personal note, when necessary, and signed blank checks\r\nto be used when the treasury was empty and repaid when outstanding\r\npledges were collected. Mrs. Phoebe Hearst headed the list with $1,000.\r\nMrs. Stanford gave almost as much in railroad transportation to the\r\nspeakers and organizers. The next largest contributor was Mrs. Knox\r\nGoodrich, of San Jose, who for nearly thirty years had stood in\r\nCalifornia a faithful advocate of woman suffrage, giving time, money and\r\ninfluence. She added to her past donations nearly $500 for this\r\ncampaign. Mrs. Sargent's munificence has been mentioned. A few women\r\nsubscribed $100 each, but all the rest was given in sums ranging down\r\nto a few cents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sarah L. Knox Goodrich (Signed: \"Sarah L. Knox\r\nGoodrich\")]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"regard with deep respect your heroic life and\r\nentire devotion to the cause you have consecrated it to. Yours very\r\nsincerely. Phebe A. Hearst.\"]\r\n\r\nThe true record of these contributions would wring the heart of every\r\nman in the State. A large photograph of Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw was\r\ngiven for every $2 pledge, and many poor seamstresses and washerwomen\r\nfulfilled their pledges in twenty-five cent installments, coming eight\r\ntimes with their mite. Often when there was not enough money on hand at\r\nheadquarters to buy a postage stamp, there would come a timid knock at\r\nthe door and a poorly dressed woman would enter with a quarter or\r\nhalf-dollar, saying, \"I have done without tea this week to bring you\r\nthis money;\" or a poor little clerk would say, \"I made a piece of fancy\r\nwork evenings and sold it for this dollar.\" Many a woman who worked hard\r\nten hours a day to earn her bread, would come to headquarters and carry\r\nhome a great armload of circulars to fold and address after night. And\r\nthere were teachers and stenographers and other workingwomen who went\r\nwithout a winter cloak in order to give the money to this movement for\r\nfreedom. This pathetic story ought to be written in full and given to\r\nevery man who eases his conscience by saying, \"The majority of women do\r\nnot want to vote;\" and to every well-fed, well-clothed woman who\r\ndeclares in her selfish ease, \"I have all the rights I want.\"\r\n\r\nKnowing that if the suffrage amendment were placed first or last among\r\nthe six which were to be voted on, it would be a target for those who\r\ncould not read, the ladies wrote to the Secretary of State asking that\r\nit be placed in the middle of the list. He answered, June 26: \"It shall\r\nbe as you request and the suffrage amendment be third in order as\r\ncertified by me to the various county clerks.\" When the tickets were\r\nprinted, however, it was placed at the end of the list and thus\r\nnecessarily at the end of the whole ticket, making it a conspicuous\r\nmark. The explanation given was that Governor Budd had directed the\r\namendments to be placed on the ballot in the same order as they had\r\nappeared in his proclamation. As this had not been issued until July 20,\r\na month after the official request of the ladies had been granted, one\r\nmust conclude there was a mistake somewhere. The results were exactly\r\nwhat had been feared. In San Francisco alone hundreds of ballots were\r\ncast on which there was only one cross and that against the amendment;\r\nnot even the presidential electors voted for.\r\n\r\nThere were 247,454 votes cast on the suffrage amendment; 110,355 for;\r\n137,099 against; defeated by 26,734. The majority against in San\r\nFrancisco was 23,772; in Alameda county, comprising Oakland, Alameda and\r\nBerkeley, 3,627; total, 27,399-665 votes more than the whole majority\r\ncast against the amendment. Berkeley gave a majority in favor, so in\r\nreality it was defeated by the vote of San Francisco, Oakland and\r\nAlameda.[124] Alameda is the banner Republican county and gave a good\r\nmajority for the Republican ticket. There never had been a hope of\r\ncarrying San Francisco for the amendment, but the result in Alameda\r\ncounty was a most unpleasant surprise, as the voters were principally\r\nRepublicans and Populists, both of whom were pledged in the strongest\r\npossible manner in their county conventions to support the amendment,\r\nand every newspaper in the county had declared in favor of it. The fact\r\nremains, however, that a change of 13,400 votes in the entire State\r\nwould have carried the amendment; and proves beyond question that, if\r\nsufficient organization work had been done, this might have been\r\naccomplished in spite of the combined efforts of the liquor dealers and\r\nthe political bosses.\r\n\r\nNear midnight of election day, a touching sight might have been\r\nwitnessed on a certain street in San Francisco: two women over seventy\r\nyears of age, one the beloved wife of a man whom California had selected\r\nas its representative in the United States Senate and whom the\r\ngovernment had sent as its minister to the court of Germany; the other a\r\nwoman universally admitted to be the peer of any man in the country in\r\nstatesmanship and knowledge of public affairs--Mrs. A. A. Sargent and\r\nSusan B. Anthony. In the darkness of night, arm in arm, they went down\r\nthe street, peering into the windows of the rough little booths where\r\nthe judges and clerks of the election were counting votes. The rooms\r\nwere black with tobacco smoke and in one they saw a man fall off his\r\nchair too drunk to finish the count. They listened to the oaths and\r\njeers as the votes were announced against the suffrage amendment, to\r\nwhich they had given almost their lives. Then in the darkness they crept\r\nsilently home, mournfully realizing that women must wait for another and\r\nbetter generation of men to give them the longed-for freedom.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when Miss Anthony came down to breakfast she found a\r\ngroup in the Sargent library reading the news of the election, and all\r\nlooked at her in sorrowing sympathy. She stood still in the center of\r\nthe room for a moment and then said sadly: \"I don't care for myself, I\r\nam used to defeat, but these dear California women who have worked so\r\nhard, how can they bear it?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony not only had donated her own services but had paid her\r\nsecretary's salary of $75 per month and permitted her to give her entire\r\ntime to the State headquarters for seven months, while she herself\r\nattended to the drudgery of her immense correspondence whenever she\r\ncould get a spare hour. Even at the small sum of $25 for a regular\r\nspeech, she would have contributed over $3,000 to this campaign, in\r\naddition to the scores of little parlor and club addresses. She gave her\r\nservices freely and willingly and did not regret them, but often said\r\nthat the California campaign was the most harmonious and satisfactory of\r\nany in which she ever was engaged. There was not the slightest friction\r\nbetween herself and the State association or State headquarters, and\r\nmost of those prominent in the work were of such refinement and nobility\r\nof character that it was a pleasure to be associated with them. Not a\r\nday passed that she did not receive some token of affection from the\r\nwomen of the State. The Sargent home was filled with the flowers and\r\nbaskets and boxes of fresh and dried fruits, etc., which were sent to\r\nher.[125]\r\n\r\nOn November 5, two days after the election, a large body of California\r\nwomen met in Golden Gate Hall to hold the annual State Suffrage\r\nConvention. Miss Anthony and all the national officers remained to help.\r\nThere was not a trace of defeat or disappointment; all were brave,\r\ncheerful and ready to go to work again. Twelve hundred dollars were\r\nraised to settle all outstanding bills and the campaign closed without a\r\ndollar of indebtedness. As Mrs. Sargent was going abroad, a worthy\r\npresidential successor was elected, Mrs. Mary Wood Swift, wife of John\r\nF. Swift, minister to Japan, a fine presiding officer, a lady of much\r\nculture, travel and social prestige, who had rendered valuable service\r\nthroughout the campaign. The next evening the suffrage forces held a\r\ngrand rally in Metropolitan Temple. Every seat in that fine auditorium\r\nwas occupied and the aisles were crowded. It was not a meeting of the\r\nadherents of a lost cause, but of one which had suffered only temporary\r\ndefeat. Miss Anthony presided and was given a true California ovation\r\nand, as her voice rang out with all its old-time vigor, there was not\r\none in that vast audience but hoped she might return to lead her hosts\r\nto victory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours with Love, Mary Wood Swift\"]\r\n\r\nSaturday evening at 6 o'clock the seven eastern women started homewards,\r\nladen with tokens of affection, accompanied across the bay by a large\r\nnumber of loving friends, and moving off amidst smiles and tears and a\r\nshower of fragrant blossoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[118] Joint campaign committee: Ellen C. Sargent, chairman; Sarah B.\r\nCooper, vice-chairman; Ida H. Harper, corresponding secretary; Harriet\r\nCooper, recording secretary; Mary S. Sperry, treasurer; Mary Wood Swift\r\nand Sarah Knox Goodrich, auditors. State central committee: Mrs.\r\nSargent, Miss Anthony, Mrs. Swift, Mrs. Sperry, Mrs. Blinn, with Mary G.\r\nHay, chairman.\r\n\r\n[119] About 1 o'clock in the morning, after this eventful night, the\r\nladies were awakened by loud laughter and women's voices. They arose and\r\nwent to the window and there in the brilliantly lighted street in front\r\nof the hotel were two carriages containing several gaily dressed women.\r\nA number of the convention delegates came out and crowded around them,\r\nthree or four climbed into the carriages, wine bottles were passed and\r\nfinally, with much talk and laughter, they drove off down the street,\r\nthe men with their arms about the women's waists. The ladies returned to\r\ntheir slumbers thoroughly convinced that they had not used the correct\r\nmethods for capturing the delegates of a Democratic convention.\r\n\r\n[120] The use of these rooms was donated by the manager of the Emporium,\r\nthe large department store in the building. All through the summer and\r\nautumn a number of most capable young women, who were employed as\r\nstenographers, teachers, etc., gave every waking moment outside business\r\nhours to the work at headquarters, carrying home with them great\r\npackages of leaflets and circulars to be folded and addressed, looking\r\nafter their own precincts, and rendering services which could not have\r\nbeen paid for in money. Although all were breadwinners they labored from\r\nlove of the cause and without a thought of thanks or remuneration.\r\n\r\n[121] In Idaho all political State conventions, Republican, Populist and\r\nDemocratic, endorsed the amendment, it received a majority of the\r\npopular vote, and the women now have full suffrage.\r\n\r\n[122] To commemorate this journey Miss Selina Solomons, of San\r\nFrancisco, wrote a tender poem, beginning:\r\n\r\n    \"She walks on roses! she whose feet\r\n      Have trod so long the stony way,\r\n    They tread who lead mankind to greet\r\n      The coming of a brighter day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[123] Some of the women going the rounds with suffrage petitions in San\r\nFrancisco found a house consisting of one room with three cots, where\r\nwere registered twenty-seven voters.\r\n\r\n[124] Los Angeles gave a majority of 3,600 in favor of the amendment.\r\n\r\n[125] In her president's report, at the next annual convention, Mrs.\r\nSargent said: \"Susan B. Anthony! We can never forget her labor of love\r\nand devotion to the cause of woman suffrage in California. She counted\r\nnot her life dear to her so that she could help to awaken the interest\r\nof men and women in the great principle to which she has devoted her\r\nlife. She was not cold, nor hungry, nor tired, nor sleepy, while there\r\nwas a chance to push forward the work. Throughout the campaign Miss\r\nAnthony gave her own services and those of her secretary without money\r\nand without price. She reminds one of the great Niagara, which would be\r\nwonderful if its waters rolled and dashed for only a short period; but\r\nwhen they roll and dash on ceaselessly, nor ever stop to rest, there the\r\nwonder of it all comes in, and we can only gaze, admire and acknowledge\r\nthe great law or power behind it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nHER LETTERS--BIRTHDAY PARTY--BIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n1896-1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the way home from California Miss Anthony and Mrs. Catt stopped at\r\nReno, Nev., lecturing there Sunday, while Miss Shaw hastened on to speak\r\nat Salt Lake City. Then all met at Kansas City to attend the Missouri\r\nconvention, where they were the guests of Mrs. Sarah Chandler Coates.\r\nThe papers refer to Miss Anthony's speeches at this convention as being\r\nthe very strongest she ever had made, and of her perfect physical\r\ncondition at the close of an eight months' campaign.\r\n\r\nShe went from here directly home, and on November 19 a brilliant banquet\r\nwas given in honor of Miss Shaw and herself at the Hotel Livingston by\r\nthe Political Equality Club. Mary Lewis Gannett was toast-mistress and\r\nabout 250 guests were seated at the tables. This was followed by the\r\nState convention at Rochester. After a few days' rest Miss Anthony went\r\nto the home of Mrs. Catt, near New York, where a business meeting was\r\nheld of the national executive board. With Mrs. Avery she then took one\r\nof the great Sound steamers for Boston to attend a meeting of the\r\nNational Woman's Council. A reception was given by Mrs. Charles W. Bond,\r\nof Commonwealth Avenue, and one at the Hotel Vendome. She ran up to\r\nConcord, N. H., for a few days' visit with her aged friends, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Parker Pillsbury and Mrs. Armenia S. White. Then back again to the\r\nGarrisons', and out to Medford for a day with Mrs. Edward M. Davis, the\r\ndaughter of Lucretia Mott.\r\n\r\nShe left Boston December 9, to fulfill a promise made to Elizabeth\r\nBuffum Chace, to spend her ninetieth birthday at her home in Valley\r\nFalls, R. I. Mrs. Chace had written a number of letters with her own\r\ntrembling hand to arrange for this visit. It was only a family party,\r\nbut the diary tells of the cake with ninety little candles, and other\r\nbirthday features. Anna Shaw came in time for the supper, and the next\r\nday Mrs. Chace sent them in her carriage to Providence to attend the\r\nState convention. Here they were guests in the handsome old Eddy\r\nhomestead, and Miss Anthony addressed a large audience in the evening.\r\nShe stopped a day in New York to tell Mrs. Stanton about the California\r\ncampaign, and Sunday morning reached her own dear home. Her old and\r\nloved friend, Maria Porter, had died the preceding night, and she\r\nattended the funeral services next day. On December 23 she went to\r\nNiagara Falls with her stenographer to secure reminiscences from her\r\ncousin, Sarah Anthony Burtis, aged eighty-six, who was a teacher in the\r\nhome school at Battenville over sixty years before.\r\n\r\nThe year just closed had been busy but pleasant. It had brought the\r\nusual number of tokens of appreciation, one of which was notice of\r\nelection as honorary member of the Chicago Woman's Club. Among the\r\nscores of invitations on file were one from Judge George F. Danforth to\r\nmeet the justices of the appellate court at his home; and one to the\r\ngolden wedding of her old fellow-laborers, Giles B. and Catharine F.\r\nStebbins, at Detroit, the latter one of the secretaries of that famous\r\nfirst convention of 1848. Major James B. Pond, the well-known lecture\r\nmanager, wrote Miss Mary Anthony: \"Thank you for your kind letter and\r\nthe excellent photograph of your great sister, whom I have admired and\r\nhoped and prayed for since I was a poor boy out in Kansas. I still\r\nbelieve she will be spared to witness a general triumph of her noble\r\ncause.\" The letter contained an offer of $100 for a parlor lecture by\r\nMiss Anthony at Jersey City.\r\n\r\nA few of Miss Anthony's own letters, taken almost at random from copies\r\non her file, will illustrate the vast scope of her correspondence and\r\nher peculiarly trenchant mode of expression. To one who wanted a\r\ntestimonial from her that she might show in vindication of certain\r\naccusations, she wrote:\r\n\r\n     I went through all the fire of charges of stealing, and of every\r\n     other crime in the whole calendar, twenty-five years ago--charges\r\n     made, too, by people of vastly more influence than any of the women\r\n     who are talking and writing today about you. I never made a public\r\n     denial of one of them, through all the years of the bitterest kind\r\n     of persecution, and believe I was greatly the gainer by working\r\n     right on and ignoring them. It will be the mistake of your life if\r\n     you go into print in your own defence. Your denial will reach a new\r\n     set of people and start them to talking, while the ones who read\r\n     the original charges will never see the refutation of them.\r\n\r\nTo one of the newly-enfranchised women of Utah:\r\n\r\n     The one word I should have to say to the women throughout your\r\n     State would be, not so much to try to get women elected to the\r\n     offices as to get the best persons, whether men or women. Naturally\r\n     there will be a far less number of women than of men capable of\r\n     holding office, from the very fact of their long disfranchisement.\r\n     I do hope your women therefore will set a good example not only for\r\n     Utah, but also for the States where they are not enfranchised;\r\n     namely, that of proving it is not the spoils of office they are\r\n     after. I think the women of Wyoming always have been wonderfully\r\n     judicious in not being anxious to hold offices themselves, but\r\n     mightily anxious as to what men hold them. It will be considered a\r\n     strong objection to woman suffrage if the vast majority of your\r\n     women should prove themselves mere partisans.\r\n\r\nTo a New York cousin: \"Your little birthday present, the Book of\r\nProverbs, came duly. Solomon's wise sayings, however, don't help me very\r\nmuch in my work of trying to persuade men to do justice to women. These\r\nmen and their progenitors for generations back have read Solomon over\r\nand over again, and learned nothing therefrom of fair play for woman,\r\nand I fear generations to come will continue to read to as little\r\npurpose. At any rate, I propose to peg away in accordance with my own\r\nsense of wisdom rather than Solomon's. All those old fellows were very\r\ngood for their time, but their wisdom needs to be newly interpreted in\r\norder to apply to people of today.\"\r\n\r\nIn answer to a letter from Illinois asking the secret of her success in\r\nlife:\r\n\r\n     If I may be said to have made a success of my life, the one great\r\n     element in it has been constancy of purpose--not allowing myself\r\n     to be switched off the main road or tempted into bypaths of other\r\n     movements. It always has been clear to me that woman suffrage is\r\n     the one great principle underlying all reforms. With the ballot in\r\n     her hand woman becomes a vital force--declaring her will for\r\n     herself, instead of praying and beseeching men to declare it for\r\n     her. It has been a long, hard fight, a dark, discouraging road, but\r\n     all along the way here and there a little bright spot to cheer us\r\n     on. And now we have four true republics, whose women are\r\n     full-fledged citizens, and the prospects are hopeful for others\r\n     soon to follow in the wake of those blessed four. One of the most\r\n     cheering things in these days is the large number of young women\r\n     who are entering the work, bringing to it a new, strong enthusiasm\r\n     which will push on to victory. The women over all the country are\r\n     waking up to the fact that truly to possess themselves, to have\r\n     their opinions respected, they must have this right of suffrage.\r\n\r\nA letter from the secretary of a national conference which was seeking\r\nto bring about a union of reformers, Prohibitionists, Free Silver\r\nadvocates, etc., asked her assistance and called forth the following\r\nresponse:\r\n\r\n     It is all very well for you men, who have the power to make and\r\n     unmake political parties, to form a third, fourth or fiftieth\r\n     party, as the case may be; but as for myself and all who are of my\r\n     class, disfranchised and helpless, we have nothing to do with any\r\n     of them--old or new--except to ask each and all to put a woman\r\n     suffrage plank in their platform and educate their members to place\r\n     a ballot in the hands of women. I never have identified myself with\r\n     any political party, but have stood outside of all, asking each to\r\n     pledge itself to the enfranchisement of women. Whenever any one of\r\n     them has asked me to speak in its meetings on the suffrage\r\n     question, I have accepted the invitation, but I never have\r\n     advocated the specific measures of any.\r\n\r\n     So, you see, I can be of no help to you, but I do know that no one\r\n     of the reform political parties ever will amount to much standing\r\n     alone, and that it would be a good thing for all of them to come\r\n     together in one body. I might say, however, that least of all could\r\n     I join yours, which makes \"God the author of civil government.\" If\r\n     such civil government as we have was made by God, what reason is\r\n     there to expect any improvement in the future?\r\n\r\nFrom a letter to Isabella Beecher Hooker:\r\n\r\n     Fortune indeed does not smile any too favorably upon us who feel so\r\n     longingly the need to use money. I am crippled all the time and\r\n     prevented from doing what I might by lack of funds. The old faith\r\n     would say, I suppose, that whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth\r\n     financially, but seems to me I could better do His work and my own\r\n     for the regeneration of the world, if I had the money to do it\r\n     with.... What a fuss the men are making nowadays over \"good\r\n     government\"--the idiots! Can't they see it is impossible to\r\n     improve things until they get a new and better balance of power\r\n     that will outweigh the one which now pulls down the political\r\n     scales and makes decency kick the beam every time? It does try my\r\n     soul that we can not make them see they are simply trying to lift\r\n     themselves by their bootstraps. Well, they are born of\r\n     disfranchised mothers, a subject class, and one can not expect\r\n     different results.\r\n\r\n     If I could spare the time and money I would love to accept your\r\n     invitation to sit with you and your dear John in your summer\r\n     retreat, and chat over the world of work for our good cause. Of the\r\n     before and the after I know absolutely nothing, and have very\r\n     little desire and less time to question or to study. I know this\r\n     seems very material to you, and yet to me it is wholly spiritual,\r\n     for it is giving time and study rather to making things better in\r\n     the _between_, which is really all that we can influence; but\r\n     perhaps when I can no longer enter into active, practical work, I\r\n     may lapse into speculations.\r\n\r\nTo a debating society asking her opinion on the question of \"educated\r\nand property suffrage:\"\r\n\r\n     I always have taken the negative; that is, have believed in\r\n     universal suffrage without either property or educational\r\n     qualification. I hold that every citizen has a right to a voice in\r\n     the government under which he lives. While an education is highly\r\n     desirable, yet a man may be unable to read but may attend political\r\n     meetings, talk with his neighbors and form intelligent opinions. He\r\n     may be honest and beyond bribery, and a more desirable voter than\r\n     many wily and unscrupulous men who have a graduate's diploma. It\r\n     is, however, the duty of the State to educate its citizens; and the\r\n     Australian ballot, which has been largely adopted, is in itself an\r\n     educational qualification.\r\n\r\n     As to a property qualification: while in the majority of cases,\r\n     perhaps, the possession of property is evidence of ability and\r\n     thrift, there are many who do not own property and yet are\r\n     possessed of good sense and are more capable of casting an honest\r\n     and intelligent ballot than some of the wealthy men of the country;\r\n     then, too, those who have least are the ones who suffer most from\r\n     the legislation of the rich, and need the ballot for\r\n     self-protection. I am decidedly opposed to a property\r\n     qualification.\r\n\r\nTo one who was in deep grief she said in an affectionate letter: \"Do\r\nassure me that you are beginning to think of your dear one as he was\r\nwhen well and moving about in his always helpful and cheering manner. To\r\nget far enough from the sickness, the suffering and the death of our\r\nfriends, so as to be able to have only the thought of them in their full\r\nvigor of life, is the greatest joy which possibly can come to those who\r\nhave lost their beloved.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Anthony was thus constantly giving out from the vast wealth\r\nof her heart and brain, she was receiving, also, from all parts of the\r\ncountry the strong and loving tributes of noble souls. A beautiful one\r\nwhich shines on the pages of 1896 was pronounced by the eloquent Dr. H.\r\nW. Thomas, of Chicago, in the course of a Sunday sermon entitled\r\n\"Progressive Greatness,\" delivered to a large audience assembled in\r\nMcVicker's Theater:\r\n\r\n     A Washington and a Lincoln have come in our great century, and\r\n     between their birthdays was born a Susan B. Anthony, whose grand\r\n     life has been given to a noble cause; once the target for the cruel\r\n     and bitter shafts of ridicule; now deemed the noblest among women.\r\n     The task of Washington and Lincoln could not be complete till the\r\n     crown was placed on the brow of woman as well as man; and when the\r\n     angels shall call Susan B. Anthony to the life immortal, her name,\r\n     her memory on earth should and will take its place among the\r\n     martyrs and saints of liberty, not for man alone, but for woman and\r\n     child.\"\r\n\r\nTo watch the old year out and the New Year in, Miss Anthony went to\r\nGeneva, and here spent a few days very pleasantly with Elizabeth Smith\r\nMiller and her guest, Harriot Stanton Blatch. Among the New Year's\r\nremembrances were $50 from Mrs. Elda A. Orr, of Reno, Nev.; $150 from\r\nMrs. Gross, of Chicago; and $300 from Mrs. Cornelia Collins Hussey, of\r\nOrange, N. J. The usual number of congratulatory letters were received\r\nfrom all classes of people, high and low, old and young, white and\r\ncolored.\r\n\r\nTo show their wide range two or three may be given. From Mrs. Ellen M.\r\nHenrotin, president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs: \"I send\r\nto you on the New Year a fraternal greeting and my best wishes that this\r\nmay prove for you and the interests you represent, a year of\r\nfulfillment. We are all serving the same cause and we are surely among\r\nthe happy ones of earth that we are enabled to assist, by even a slight\r\nimpetus, the 'power which makes for righteousness.' ... Therefore I send\r\nyou today my heartfelt wishes for the continued success of your cause\r\nand the peace and prosperity of your life.\"\r\n\r\nHer friend of fifty years, John W. Hutchinson, the last of that\r\nnever-equalled family of singers, sent his New Year's greetings and\r\nadded: \"I bless you and your work. Wonderful possibilities will be the\r\nresult of this great movement, which you have led, for equal rights and\r\nthe franchise for women.\" The president of the National Council of\r\nWomen, Mary Lowe Dickinson, an earnest, efficient worker for humanity,\r\nsaid in the course of a long letter dated January 9:\r\n\r\n     I pray that all strength and blessing of every kind may crown this\r\n     coming year of your life; and O, how earnestly I hope that in it\r\n     you may see the fruition of some of the work that you have been\r\n     struggling with these many, many years. When I run over in my mind\r\n     the present situation of the cause you represent--which seems to me\r\n     more and more the one cause which must succeed if we are going to\r\n     have genuine success anywhere else--I see what ground you have for\r\n     encouragement and what a vast advance has been made; but I see,\r\n     too, how slow it must seem to you, and how weary of waiting you\r\n     must become. I know no courage like yours, and I do that courage\r\n     full honor.\r\n\r\nShe had received a telegram of greeting from Frances E. Willard as soon\r\nas she arrived home from California, and January 5 accepted her urgent\r\ninvitation for a little visit with her at the sanitarium of Dr. Cordelia\r\nGreen, Castile; and while there addressed a parlor gathering of the\r\npatients. On January 15 she was guest of honor at a luncheon given by\r\nthe Educational and Industrial Union of Rochester, at the Genesee\r\nclubhouse, to the State executive committee of the Federation of Clubs.\r\nMrs. Charlotte Perkins Stetson spent a few days with her, and she\r\narranged for her to hold Sunday evening services in the Unitarian\r\nchurch. On January 20 the two ladies, with Miss Mary, started for the\r\ntwenty-ninth annual convention of the national association, which was to\r\nbe held this year at Des Moines, Ia. The thermometer was 15° below zero,\r\nthe snow very deep, and Miss Anthony's friends saw her set forth on the\r\njourney to this cold western city with much anxiety. All their protests,\r\nhowever, were not sufficient to keep her at home; but she thought with\r\nmuch longing of the clean, beautiful streets of Washington, the mild\r\nclimate, the Congressional committees, the crowds of visitors there from\r\nvarious parts of the country who always came to the convention, and she\r\nfelt more strongly than ever that it was a serious mistake to take it\r\naway from the national capital.\r\n\r\nShe stopped at Chicago for a few days, and a characteristic little entry\r\nin her diary says: \"I slept on a $6,000 bed last night; my! how much\r\ngood suffrage work could have been done with that money.\" On the\r\nafternoon of January 23, Miss Anthony addressed a large meeting of the\r\nWoman's Club and in the course of her remarks paid a tribute to that\r\norganization, in which she said: \"This is the banner club of the United\r\nStates, not because it has such nice women for members, and not even\r\nbecause it is located in Chicago, but because it is a club which does a\r\nlarge amount of practical work.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Foster Avery joined the party at Chicago and they reached Des\r\nMoines January 24, where they found the rest of the executive board, and\r\nall were entertained in the suburban mansion of James and Martha C.\r\nCallanan. The meetings were held in the Central Christian church, whose\r\npastor, Rev. H. O. Breeden, extended a cordial greeting. Notwithstanding\r\nthe extreme severity of the weather, 24° below zero, the audience-room\r\nwas crowded to its capacity at every public session, and overflow\r\nmeetings were held. The convention was officially welcomed by Governor\r\nFrancis M. Drake and Mayor John McVicar; Mrs. Adelaide Ballard, State\r\npresident, made the opening address, and Mrs. Macomber spoke in behalf\r\nof the women's clubs of the city. State Senator Rowan was one of the\r\nspeakers. Among the letters of greeting was one from Miss Kitty Reed,\r\ndaughter of Speaker Thomas B. Reed. The memorial services showed that\r\nnever in any previous year had so long a list of friends to the cause\r\npassed away as in 1896. There were thirty-seven names mentioned in the\r\nresolutions.[126]\r\n\r\nIn Miss Anthony's address she spoke of the great victories in 1896, as\r\nshown by the full enfranchisement of the women of Utah and Idaho. Mrs.\r\nM. C. Woods, from the latter State, presented an interesting account of\r\nthe late campaign and an outline of their work for the future. Her\r\nmother, Emmeline B. Wells, made the report for Utah. Delegates were\r\npresent from twenty States, and most of them were entertained in the\r\nhospitable homes of the city. A reception, attended by 500 guests, was\r\ntendered by Mr. and Mrs. Hubbell, at their elegant residence on Terrace\r\nHill. An imaginative reporter on this occasion transformed Miss\r\nAnthony's historic garnet velvet gown, worn for the past fourteen years,\r\ninto a \"magnificent royal purple,\" and her one simple little pin into\r\n\"handsome diamonds.\" A pleasant reception also was given by the Woman's\r\nClub in their commodious parlors. The daily newspapers contained\r\nexcellent reports of the convention, but not one gave editorial\r\nendorsement of the cause it represented.\r\n\r\nThose who believed in holding the alternate national conventions away\r\nfrom Washington were satisfied with the result; those who thought\r\ndifferently continued to hold the same opinion, and among the latter was\r\nMiss Anthony, who soon afterwards wrote to one of the business\r\ncommittee:\r\n\r\n     The conventions at Atlanta and Des Moines have but confirmed me in\r\n     my judgment that our delegated body always should meet in\r\n     Washington. For local propaganda both were undoubtedly good, but\r\n     for effect in securing Congressional action, absolutely nil. I\r\n     believe in resuming our old plan of holding at least two\r\n     conventions every year, one for the election of officers and for\r\n     its influence upon Congress in Washington every winter; the other\r\n     in whatsoever State we have constitutional amendments pending,\r\n     where we need to do our greatest amount of work in that direction.\r\n     The best way for the national association to help create local\r\n     sentiment is to build up and make a success of the different State\r\n     annual meetings, and to have at least two of its ablest and most\r\n     popular speakers attend as many of them as possible every year; and\r\n     I think by this means we can do a great deal more to make the\r\n     States feel that the national is mother to them, than by once in a\r\n     lifetime holding a delegate convention within their borders. I am\r\n     more and more convinced that some of the national officers must be\r\n     present at every State annual meeting, and if well advertised there\r\n     would be as many representatives of the local clubs present as go\r\n     to our national convention.\r\n\r\nOn the way home from Des Moines Miss Anthony spent a few days at\r\nIndianapolis. The evening of February 3, Mrs. Sewall gave a reception in\r\nher honor, to which were invited the governor, members of the\r\nlegislature, State officials and their wives, members of the Woman's\r\nCouncil and their husbands. At one end of the large drawing-room, on a\r\nslightly raised platform covered with rugs, sat Miss Anthony and\r\nIndiana's most revered woman, Zerelda G. Wallace, to whom Mrs. Sewall\r\npresented the guests. Later in the evening both of these ladies, from\r\ntheir \"throne,\" as it was laughingly called, gave pleasant informal\r\naddresses, to which Senator Roots responded on behalf of the\r\nlegislature. The next day Mrs. Wallace and Miss Anthony's old friend,\r\nHon. George W. Julian, were entertained at luncheon and had a long\r\nafternoon chat. In the evening a reception was given for her by Mr. John\r\nC. and Mrs. Lillian Wright Dean at their pleasant home \"The Pines.\"\r\n\r\nThe morning of February 5 Miss Anthony was invited to address a joint\r\nsession of the Indiana legislature in the Assembly chamber. The judges\r\nof the supreme and appellate courts and most of the State officials were\r\npresent, and all the visitors' seats on the floor and in the galleries\r\nwere filled with Indianapolis ladies. Miss Anthony was introduced with\r\nwords of praise by Representative Packard, and spoke for an hour, making\r\nher usual strong plea for a Sixteenth Amendment enfranchising women.\r\n\r\nOn February 6, at 9 A. M., in the midst of rain and sleet, she arrived\r\nin Rochester and, in less than an hour, reporters from every newspaper\r\nin the city were on hand for an interview. They had learned long since\r\nthat they always were sure of a cordial reception at her cozy home, and\r\nthat the returned traveller would not fail to tell them something which\r\nwould make interesting reading. Miss Anthony was actuated by two motives\r\nin this: One was her desire to get as much suffrage news as possible\r\ninto the papers, for no one could have a higher appreciation of the\r\nvalue of the press; the other was a strong sentiment of admiration and\r\nfriendship for the faithful and industrious men and women who earn a\r\nliving at newspaper work.\r\n\r\nSunday night, February 14, the birthday of Frederick Douglass was\r\nobserved in the Plymouth Congregational Church. Miss Anthony presided\r\nover the large meeting and introduced the speakers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANTHONY RESIDENCE.\r\n\r\nSINCE 1865, ROCHESTER, N. Y.]\r\n\r\nThere had been something in the air of Rochester for several weeks,\r\nsomething of a social nature in which most of the people in the city\r\nseemed interested, and it promised to culminate on the approaching 15th\r\nof February, when Miss Anthony should be eleven times seven years old.\r\nThis famous birthday, which had been beautifully celebrated in New York,\r\nWashington and numbers of other cities and towns throughout the country,\r\nalso had been often pleasantly observed in Rochester; but it was thought\r\nby many people here that it was time Miss Anthony's own city should hold\r\na celebration which should eclipse all on record. The first intimation\r\nshe had was the receipt of this invitation:\r\n\r\n     The woman's clubs of this city are planning to give a reception in\r\n     your honor at Powers Hall on the evening of your seventy-seventh\r\n     birthday, February 15, 1897. They have chosen this means of\r\n     publicly expressing the great esteem in which they hold you, and\r\n     the pride they feel in reckoning among their number a woman of\r\n     national reputation. They trust that this date will be\r\n     satisfactory, and this manner of showing their respect not\r\n     distasteful to you. Very sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                     OLIVE DAVIS,\r\n          _Corresponding Secretary of the Committee on Arrangements_.\r\n\r\nThe committee was composed of one member of each of the sixteen woman's\r\nclubs, and the admirable manner in which the affair was conducted\r\ncertainly indicated that it was in the hands of representative\r\nwomen.[127] Most of the Rochester papers contained editorials of\r\ncongratulation. Among others the Post-Express said of the celebration:\r\n\r\n     Its purpose is to indicate the esteem in which she is held by the\r\n     people of the city of which she has, for many years, been a\r\n     resident. It is not intended as a demonstration in behalf of the\r\n     cause with which she has been especially identified. Its meaning is\r\n     deeper and its scope is broader than this. It is the woman, rather\r\n     than the advocate, who is to be honored....\r\n\r\n     Rochester is proud of Susan B. Anthony--proud that it can call her\r\n     its citizen. It has come to appreciate her quality. It understands,\r\n     not alone that she has stood in the front ranks of those who have\r\n     done battle for the equality of woman with man at the ballot-box,\r\n     but that she has also done much for the emancipation of woman from\r\n     civil thralldom and social inferiority, and that in all good causes\r\n     she has been distinguished--in philanthropies as in politics, in\r\n     the reformation of moral abuses as in the righting of what seemed\r\n     to her civic wrongs. As her work has proceeded, she has conquered\r\n     prejudice and persuaded respect--respect for herself independent of\r\n     and even superior to that for the causes in which she has enlisted.\r\n     And so it occurs that the citizens of Rochester, without regard to\r\n     the opinions they entertain upon woman suffrage and cognate\r\n     movements, but wholly in admiration and affection for a noble\r\n     woman, unite in the reception which awaits her, cordial and full of\r\n     meaning. It will be a notable occasion, and one long to be\r\n     remembered.\r\n\r\nThe daily papers gave long and elaborate reports of this great\r\nreception, headed, \"Our beloved Susan; Two thousand hands grasped by the\r\nGrand Old Woman;\" \"Rochester Shows its Love for Her,\" etc., etc. A\r\nportion of the Herald account may be quoted as indicating the tone of\r\nall:\r\n\r\n     The reception accorded to Susan B. Anthony at Powers Hall by the\r\n     woman's clubs of Rochester was one of the most brilliant events of\r\n     the kind ever held in this city. All the prominent people of both\r\n     sexes were there, and each vied with the others in doing honor to\r\n     the woman whose splendid attributes of mind and heart have\r\n     reflected so much credit on the city. But little preliminary work\r\n     was needed, as it partook largely of the nature of a spontaneous\r\n     tribute. Fully 2,000 people, representing the beauty, wealth and\r\n     intelligence of the city, passed before this unostentatious, kindly\r\n     woman during the evening and esteemed it an honor to press her\r\n     hand.\r\n\r\n     The guests began to arrive at 8:30 o'clock and continued to come in\r\n     a steady stream for two hours thereafter. Miss Anthony stood at the\r\n     western end of the large room and around her were gathered the\r\n     reception committee, composed of representatives from each of the\r\n     woman's clubs in the city. The guests formed in line as they\r\n     entered and each in succession took the hand of Miss Anthony. She\r\n     greeted every one cordially and had a pleasant word for each. In\r\n     one hand she held a beautiful bouquet of white and yellow roses\r\n     sent by Miss Frances E. Willard.\r\n\r\nThere were more than Rochester's most distinguished citizens; hundreds\r\nof the poor and the humble, a number of colored people, men and women in\r\nall the walks of life, thronged the great hall surrounded with famous\r\npaintings and radiant with electric lights, flowers and beautiful\r\ncostumes. They came to grasp the hand of one who had made no distinction\r\nof race or rank or belief in her fifty years' work of uplifting all\r\nhumanity. If these had not been present, Miss Anthony would have felt\r\nthat her own city had not offered its full tribute of recognition.\r\n\r\nAt the Anthony home the day was a happy one. Rev. Anna Shaw came to help\r\ncelebrate. The house was filled with guests from out of town and many\r\ncallers, and the bell was ringing all day for telegrams, letters and\r\npackages. There were potted plants and cut flowers, baskets of violets\r\nand hyacinths, and great bunches of roses and carnations. Letters and\r\ntelegrams came from California and Massachusetts, and a number of States\r\nbetween. Clubs of many descriptions sent messages, and even\r\nSunday-schools offered greetings. Mariana W. Chapman, president New York\r\nState Suffrage Association, expressed the congratulations of that body,\r\nand from all the National-American officers came words of appreciation.\r\nAmong these were the following from the national organizer, Carrie\r\nChapman Catt:\r\n\r\n     When a woman lives to be seventy-seven years old, having given a\r\n     whole half-century and more to the cause of human liberty, her age\r\n     becomes a crown of glory, before which every lover of progress bows\r\n     in acknowledgment. Such a woman is she whom we know as \"Saint\r\n     Susan.\" Upon her birthday I have but one wish, and in this millions\r\n     of grateful American women join with me; may she live in health and\r\n     strength undiminished, until she witnesses the last woman in the\r\n     United States blessed with all the political privileges of\r\n     citizenship. If this wish might be fulfilled, I know it would bring\r\n     the highest joy ever permitted a human being; therefore because I\r\n     love her tenderly I make it, with gratitude for her years of\r\n     service and with a reverence unspeakable for the woman whose\r\n     courage, determination and adherence to principle made the service\r\n     possible.\r\n\r\nA few evenings later Miss Anthony attended a meeting held in Rochester\r\nby the Cuban League. As soon as she entered she was invited to a seat\r\non the stage and then the audience insisted on a speech. Finally she\r\ncame forward and said:\r\n\r\n     From the report of the first outrage in Cuba down to the present\r\n     time, there has not been a moment but that its people have had my\r\n     sympathy. Never since I began to know the meaning of the word\r\n     \"freedom\" has anything taken a stronger hold on me than this\r\n     struggle in Cuba. Even where all men are free, women are not, and I\r\n     trust that when Cuban men achieve their independence and frame\r\n     their constitution, they will not forget the women who have borne\r\n     the struggle with them, as our Revolutionary fathers forgot the\r\n     women who toiled by their side. The men of only four out of\r\n     forty-five States of our republic have yet granted liberty to the\r\n     women. I never can speak in a meeting like this without bearing\r\n     testimony to the cowardice of the men of this nation in refusing to\r\n     make the women free. I believe in liberty and equality for every\r\n     human being under every flag, not for men alone but for women also.\r\n\r\nThe last of February a telegram announced the death of Maude, wife of\r\nSenator L. H. Humphrey, who but a few weeks before had visited the\r\nAnthony home, and stated that the husband desired Miss Anthony to speak\r\nat the funeral. She was a young and lovely wife and mother, treasurer of\r\nthe State Federation of Clubs and an officer of the State and county\r\nsuffrage associations. It was said that Miss Anthony spoke as one\r\ninspired of the woman in whose death everything good had lost a helpful\r\nhand, who had gone out of life with no fear for herself but only loving\r\nthoughtfulness for others. She told of her courage in following the\r\ntruth wherever it might lead, of the freedom into which she had grown,\r\nand the beautiful faith and trust in which she had lived; she said that\r\nit was such who walked with God, and that her spiritual life could be\r\ncomprehended only by those who lived on the same high plane. It was a\r\ndeep regret to all who heard this exquisite eulogy that it was not\r\npreserved word for word.\r\n\r\nReference has been made in a preceding chapter to Miss Anthony's\r\npreparations for the writing of her biography, which were interrupted by\r\nthe urgent call from California. All her letters from friends and many\r\nfrom strangers, for several years, had urged that it should not longer\r\nbe deferred. But who should do it? That was the important question.\r\nThere were a number of women who possessed the ability and the desire,\r\nbut some were absorbed in family cares and others in breadwinning\r\noccupations; where was the one who could and would give a year or more\r\nof her life to this vast undertaking? The question was still unanswered\r\nwhen Miss Anthony laid everything else aside and plunged into the\r\nCalifornia campaign. Long before this had ended, she had exacted a\r\npromise from Mrs. Harper, who had charge of the State press during that\r\nlong and trying period, to come to Rochester and write the biography.\r\nShe herself agreed to remain at home till the work should be finished,\r\nand give every possible assistance from the storehouse of reminiscence\r\nand the wealth of material which had been so carefully garnered during\r\nall the years.\r\n\r\nSo the first of March, 1897, the work began. A little while before, Miss\r\nAnthony had written to a friend: \"Some one soon will write the story of\r\nmy life and will want everything she can get about me, but she will find\r\nthere is precious little when she sits down to the task.\" What the\r\nbiographer did find was two large rooms filled, from floor to ceiling,\r\nwith material of a personal and historical nature. It seemed at first as\r\nif nothing less than a cyclopedia could contain what would have to be\r\nused. Ranged around the walls were trunks, boxes and bags of letters and\r\nother documents, dating back for a century and tied in bundles just as\r\nthey had been put away from year to year. There were piles of legal\r\npapers, accounts, receipts and memoranda of every description, and the\r\ndiaries and note-books of sixty years. The shelves were filled with\r\ncongressional, convention and other reports; there were stacks of\r\nmagazines and newspapers, large numbers of scrap-books and bushels of\r\nscraps waiting to be pasted. There was, in fact, everything of this\r\nnature which can be imagined, all carefully saved and put away, waiting\r\nfor the leisure when they could be sorted and classified.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate indeed that the two women, who went to work so\r\ncheerfully on that March morning, did not realize the task which was\r\nbefore them, or their courage might have wavered. With the assistance of\r\ntheir efficient secretary, Miss Genevieve Lel Hawley, the work went\r\nsteadily on from daylight till dark for many days, until at length the\r\nsheep all were separated from the goats; the matter likely to be used\r\nplaced in one room, and the remainder arranged conveniently for\r\nreference in the other. Every scrap of writing was pressed out and each\r\nyear's quota not only placed in a separate box, but arranged according\r\nto months and days. The printed matter was carefully classified and the\r\nscrap-books all finished, a complete set of nearly fifty years.\r\n\r\nThen commenced the far more difficult labor of culling the most\r\nimportant and interesting points from this great mass of material, and\r\ncondensing them into such space as would permit the reading of the\r\nbiography during at least an average lifetime. And thus was the task\r\ncontinued, day after day, and far into the night, for much more than a\r\nyear. The snows of winter melted away; the bare branches of the tall\r\nchestnut trees which towered above the windows put forth their buds and\r\nburst into a wilderness of snowy blossoms; the birds built their nests\r\namong the green leaves, reared their young and flew away with them to\r\nwarmer climes before the chill winds of approaching autumn; the\r\nluxuriant foliage faded and dropped to the earth; again the naked\r\nbranches stretched out to a stormy sky, and the snow lay deep on the\r\nfrozen ground; while the story followed the life and work of this great\r\nhistoric character through the slow unfolding out of the depths of the\r\npast; the development from the springtime of youth into the fruitful\r\nsummer of maturity; the mellowing into the richness and beauty of\r\nautumn; the coming at last into the snowy spotlessness of serene and\r\nbeautiful old age.\r\n\r\nThe attic workrooms were an ideal place for this long and exacting task,\r\nsecluded from all interruption and dedicated so entirely to the work\r\nthat not a book or paper ever was disturbed. A pretty description\r\nwritten by Mrs. Minette Cheshire Hair, of the Rochester Democrat and\r\nChronicle staff, and published in a number of papers, thus began:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATTIC WORK-ROOMS WHERE THE BIOGRAPHY WAS WRITTEN.]\r\n\r\n     Way up on the third floor of the cozy home at 17 Madison street,\r\n     away from the dust and noise of the pavement, in a charming den\r\n     admirably arranged for the purpose, two women have for months\r\n     been busily engaged getting together material and putting it in\r\n     shape for the publishers, which will give to the world a story--the\r\n     story of a career as remarkable as any ever written. Pausing on the\r\n     threshold, a description of the sanctum is not out of place, for\r\n     the pleasant atmosphere and surroundings at once impress the\r\n     visitor, so unconsciously have the occupants stamped it with their\r\n     own strong individuality. It consists of two large and airy rooms\r\n     which appear to be literally perched in the tree-tops, so close are\r\n     the swaying branches, which seem to nod approval and encouragement\r\n     to the two busy workers seated before a large bow window. Patches\r\n     of the blue sky glimmer above and through them, and the scene\r\n     without is restful and inspiring. Within is a large, low table\r\n     where the writing is done, and an easy couch piled with pillows\r\n     invites repose when the brain grows too weary.\r\n\r\n     The rooms are plain and ceiled above in natural wood, and on\r\n     shelves arranged along the sides are boxes containing years of\r\n     correspondence and documents, dating back to 1797--just one\r\n     century. In the room beyond, three stenographers do their part of\r\n     the work, and here also are large chests filled with the\r\n     accumulations of years of public life. It would seem as if the task\r\n     before these two dauntless women were almost endless, for every\r\n     letter must be read and carefully noted, every newspaper clipping\r\n     gleaned--and these alone would make volumes--old diaries perused,\r\n     and the whole digested and woven into the fabric of facts which not\r\n     only go to make the story of one woman, but the history of the\r\n     great progressive movement of women during the past fifty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[126] Among them were Harriet Beecher Stowe, Sarah B. Cooper, Drs. Hiram\r\nCorson and Caroline B. Winslow, Judges E. G. Merrick and O. P. Stearns,\r\nMary Grew, J. Elizabeth Jones, Hannah Tracy Cutler, Sarah Southwick.\r\n\r\n[127] The idea of giving the reception originated among the members of\r\nthe Wednesday Club, some of whom conceived the thought that it was time\r\nfor the women of Rochester in some way to recognize Miss Anthony's\r\nability, energy and labors in behalf of her sex.... Reformers, as a\r\nrule, are not popular in their day, and Miss Anthony ran the gauntlet of\r\nderision and abuse years ago, but today the magnificent services she has\r\nrendered for woman are everywhere recognized.\r\n\r\nThe plans have been perfected upon a very elaborate scale. The following\r\nare represented in the movement: the Wednesday Club, the Ethical\r\nSociety, the Women's Educational and Industrial Union, the Wellesley\r\nAssociation, the Cornell Association, the Coterie, the Woman's Saturday\r\nClub, the Holyoke Association, the Jewish Council, the Sisterhood of\r\nBerith Kodesh, the Ignorance Club, the Tuesday Reading Club, the\r\nLivingston Park Seminary Alumnæ, the Rochester Female Academy Alumnæ,\r\nthe Ladies' Travellers' Club, and Mrs. Hall's Art Class.\r\n\r\nThe reception is not to women only, but it is expected that a large\r\nnumber of men will be present. [Then follows a list of names of many of\r\nthe prominent ladies of Rochester, who acted as a reception committee,\r\nand of equally well-known young men, who served as ushers.]--Democrat\r\nand Chronicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTIC VIEWS ON MANY QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was strong in her determination to remain at home and\r\ndevote herself to the biographical task, but found it almost an\r\nimpossibility to resist the calls for her services which came from all\r\ndirections. Occasionally she would slip out for a lecture, but long\r\njourneys and convention work for the most part were given up, and never\r\nduring fifty years had she remained at home a fraction of the time that\r\nshe spent here in 1897. Monday evening of each week was set apart to\r\nreceive callers and the pleasant parlors often were crowded, many of the\r\nRochester people declaring that this was their first chance of getting\r\nacquainted with their illustrious townswoman. There were two rôles,\r\nhowever, which she never could fill with any pleasure to herself, that\r\nof the society or the literary woman. While no one loves her friends\r\nmore faithfully or better enjoys receiving visits from them, she cares\r\nfor social life, in general, only so far as it can advance her cause.\r\nAlthough letter-writing is a pleasure, she hates the use of the pen for\r\nso-called literary work. Standing on the platform, words and ideas rush\r\nupon her more rapidly than she can give them utterance, but with pen in\r\nhand the thoughts still come but refuse to be formulated.\r\n\r\nIn the chapters describing the preparation of the History of Woman\r\nSuffrage was set forth in detail her restiveness at such confinement. \"I\r\nlove to make history but hate to write it,\" was her oft-repeated\r\nassertion. The years had brought no change of feeling and her\r\ncorrespondence shows how she chafed under the search of old records, the\r\nreading of faded letters. Many times she wrote: \"There is so much to be\r\ndone, so much more money is needed and so many more women are wanted for\r\nthe present work, that half the time I feel conscience-smitten to be\r\ndwelling among the scenes and people of the past. There are so very few\r\nof my early co-workers now on this side of the big river, that I am\r\nreally living with the dead most of the time; but as there is no way out\r\nof this job except through it--through it I must go.\" In the journal she\r\nsays: \"O, how it tires me to think over and talk over those old days,\r\nnot only of my own labors, but of the never-ceasing efforts to stir up\r\nothers to work.\"\r\n\r\nThe 9th of March Miss Anthony lectured before the Men's Club of the\r\nCentral Church at Auburn. On the 12th she spoke at a meeting addressed\r\nby Booker Washington in the interest of the Tuskeegee Colored Institute.\r\nThe 24th she went to Albany with Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, Mrs. Catt,\r\nElizabeth Burrill Curtis, daughter of George William Curtis, Mrs.\r\nChapman, State president; and all addressed the senate judiciary\r\ncommittee in behalf of a woman suffrage amendment. Miss Anthony went to\r\nthis hearing much against her will and, at its conclusion, declared she\r\nnever again would stoop to plead her cause before one of these\r\ncommittees. She had made her appeals to their fathers and grandfathers,\r\nand she was tired of begging for her liberty from men not half her own\r\nage and with not a hundredth part of her knowledge of State and national\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe seventieth birthday of the devoted sister Mary would occur on April\r\n2, and Miss Anthony decided to have a home reception in her honor. When\r\nshe broached the subject to a few intimate friends in the Unitarian\r\nchurch and the Political Equality Club, she found they already had such\r\narrangements well under way and they insisted that she should leave the\r\nmatter entirely in their hands. Anything which concerned the Anthony\r\nsisters interested Rochester, and the city papers contained extended\r\nnotices. The Herald began a long interview as follows:\r\n\r\n     Seventy! It did not seem possible that the sprightly, energetic\r\n     little woman who answered the reporter's ring could have reached\r\n     the allotted threescore and ten. Old Father Time is certainly no\r\n     more than a myth to Miss Mary Anthony. \"Yes,\" said she, laughing,\r\n     \"I am about to make my debut. Just think of it, a real reception in\r\n     my honor! By the time I'm eighty, my existence will probably have\r\n     become one whirl of delicious excitement.\"\r\n\r\n     The reporter asked to see Miss Susan B. Anthony; five minutes would\r\n     be sufficient; the matter was urgent and important.... Turning to\r\n     her the reporter said: \"The Herald would like you to give an\r\n     account of your sister. You know she would never admit that she\r\n     ever did anything worth mentioning, so it is from you that the true\r\n     story must come.\"\r\n\r\n     She laughed as she took off her glasses, leaned back in her chair\r\n     and asked, \"Where shall I begin?\"\r\n\r\n     \"At the beginning, please.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Well then, my sister was born in Battenville, the youngest of four\r\n     daughters. One thing may surprise you. She, not I, is the suffrage\r\n     pioneer in our family. She attended the first woman's rights\r\n     convention, and when I came home from teaching school, I heard\r\n     nothing but suffrage talk, and how lovely Lucretia Mott was, and\r\n     how sweet Elizabeth Cady Stanton was. I didn't believe in it then,\r\n     and made fun of it; but sister Mary was a firm advocate. My\r\n     brother-in-law used to tell me that I could preach woman's rights,\r\n     but it took Mary to practice them.\r\n\r\n     \"For twenty-six consecutive years, from 1857 to 1883, she taught in\r\n     our public schools. Many of the best citizens of Rochester once\r\n     went to school to her; and it is perhaps her influence upon those\r\n     minds and lives that my sister considers the most important part of\r\n     her life-work. She has always been identified with the suffrage\r\n     cause in this city and State, as I have with the national. For a\r\n     number of years she was corresponding secretary of the State\r\n     society, and for five years has been president of the city\r\n     Political Equality Club.\r\n\r\n     \"I can not tell you how she has helped and sustained me. She has\r\n     kept a home where I might come to rest. From the very beginning,\r\n     she has cheered and comforted me. She has looked after the great\r\n     mass of details, my wardrobe, my business, etc., leaving me free.\r\n     She is the unseen worker who ought to share equally in whatever of\r\n     reward and praise I may have won.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democrat and Chronicle thus commenced a two-column account of the\r\nreception:\r\n\r\n     ... The occasion was the seventieth anniversary of Miss Mary\r\n     Anthony's birth and, in the afternoon and evening, crowds of her\r\n     friends gathered to offer their congratulations and do homage to\r\n     one who has done so much for the educational interests of the city\r\n     and social and political equality for her sex. Miss Mary, to be\r\n     sure, has not gained the national reputation which her famous\r\n     sister enjoys, yet among the people of Rochester she is regarded as\r\n     a sharer in the laurels won by Susan B. Whenever one is mentioned\r\n     the personality of the other is immediately brought to mind.... It\r\n     was with rare hospitality, interwoven with personal love and\r\n     respect, that Dr. and Mrs. J. E. Sanford devoted their handsome\r\n     home to the celebration of this birthday. Attired in black satin\r\n     and duchesse lace, with a pretty bouquet of bride roses in her\r\n     hand, Miss Mary presented a womanly and attractive appearance.\r\n\r\nIn the name of the club, Mrs. Sanford presented, with a felicitous\r\nlittle speech, a handsome, jetted broadcloth cape. She was followed by\r\nMrs. Greenleaf, who tendered in affectionate words a purse containing\r\n$70, a golden tribute for each year from many friends.[128] John M.\r\nThayer then made a witty and interesting address. He was followed by\r\nRev. W. C. Gannett, who dwelt especially on the work done by Miss Mary\r\nin looking after the poor and needy for the past twenty years, not only\r\nas an officer of the city charitable association but in a private\r\ncapacity, and closed by saying:\r\n\r\n     It takes two sorts of people to make a reform: One who become\r\n     public speakers and bear the brunt of obloquy, and the other who in\r\n     obscurity lend their assistance to the work. There are hundreds of\r\n     this latter class that the world never hears about. It is the\r\n     blessed silent side of life, and it seems to me that Mary is the\r\n     very incarnation of the quiet majority of this great reform which\r\n     is yet to celebrate its triumphs. In after years, when the story is\r\n     written of this political equality movement, men will say that the\r\n     battle was won by the two sisters, because there never could have\r\n     been a Susan abroad if it had not been for a Mary at home.\r\n\r\nIf there ever was a time when Miss Anthony was speechless from supreme\r\nsatisfaction it was on this occasion. All the honors ever bestowed upon\r\nherself had not afforded her the joy of this testimonial to her gentle,\r\nunassuming but strong and helpful sister, on whom she leaned far more\r\nthan the world could ever know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARY S. AND SUSAN B. ANTHONY, 1897.]\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony assisted at the elegant golden wedding celebration of Mr.\r\nand Mrs. James Sargent, April 29; not one in the receiving line under\r\nseventy, and yet not one broken or enfeebled by age. The men erect\r\nand vigorous, the women beautifully dressed and full of animation,\r\nformed a striking illustration of the changed physical and social\r\nconditions of the last half-century.\r\n\r\nEarly in June Miss Anthony, Rev. Anna Shaw, Miss Emily Howland and Mrs.\r\nHarper went to Auburn to visit Eliza Wright Osborne, with whom Mrs.\r\nStanton and her daughter, Mrs. Lawrence, were spending the summer. The\r\ndays were delightfully passed, driving through the shaded streets of\r\nthat \"loveliest village of the plain\" and walking about the spacious\r\npark and gardens surrounding the Osborne mansion; while in the evenings\r\nthe party gathered in the large drawing-room and listened to chapters\r\nfrom the forthcoming biography, followed with delightful reminiscences\r\nby the two elder ladies and Mrs. Osborne, whose mother, Martha C.\r\nWright, was one of their first and best-beloved friends and helpers. It\r\nwas a rare and sacred occasion, and those who were present ever will\r\ncherish the memory of those two grand pioneers, sitting side by\r\nside--Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony--the one just beyond, the\r\nother nearing the eightieth milestone of life, both having given to the\r\nworld fifty years of unremitting service, and yet both as strong in\r\nmind, as keen in satire, as brimming with cheerfulness, as in those\r\nearly days when they set about to revolutionize the prejudices and\r\ncustoms of the ages.[129]\r\n\r\nThe correspondence this year seemed heavier than ever before, letters\r\npouring in from all parts of the United States and Europe. Even from\r\nfar-off Moscow, in conservative Russia, came the cry of women for help.\r\nPages written by the pen of another could not give so accurate an idea\r\nof Miss Anthony's opinions on various topics as single paragraphs culled\r\nfrom copies of her own letters, preserved, alas, only during the past\r\nfew years since she has employed a stenographer. One scarcely knows\r\nwhich to select. To a newspaper inquiry she answered: \"The 'greatest\r\ncompliment' ever paid me was, that by my life-work I had helped to make\r\nthe conditions of the world better for women.\" She wrote to an\r\nexasperated Ohio woman:\r\n\r\n     The plan you propose, of our getting all the members of suffrage\r\n     clubs, and all individual women outside, in each State, to march to\r\n     the polls every election day and attempt to deposit their ballots,\r\n     sounds very well. But, my dear, it is impossible thus to persuade\r\n     the women, after the Supreme Court of the United States has\r\n     declared they have no right to vote under the National\r\n     Constitution. Your suggestion means a revolution which women will\r\n     not create against their own fathers, husbands, brothers and sons.\r\n     A whole race of men under a foreign or tyrannical government, like\r\n     the Cubans, may rise in rebellion, but for women thus to band\r\n     themselves against the power enthroned in their own households is\r\n     quite another matter. Hundreds have recommended your plan, so it is\r\n     nothing new, but it is utterly impractical. There can be but one\r\n     possible way for women to be freed from the degradation of\r\n     disfranchisement, and that is through the slow processes of\r\n     agitation and education, until the vast majority of women\r\n     themselves desire freedom. So long as mothers teach their sons and\r\n     daughters, by acquiescence at least, that present conditions need\r\n     no improving, you can not expect men to change them. Therefore do\r\n     not waste a single moment trying to devise any sort of\r\n     insurrectionary movement on the part of the women.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Mrs. Stanton she said:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Besant lunched with us, and I heard her last evening for the\r\n     second time. She is master of the English language, and whether or\r\n     not one can believe she sees and hears from the world of the\r\n     disembodied what she feels she does, one can not but realize that\r\n     she is a great woman and has a wonderful theory of how human souls\r\n     return to earth. But I tell her that it seems to me repellent that\r\n     we have to come back here through Dame Nature's processes, after a\r\n     period of such great freedom in the occult world, and again go\r\n     through with teething, mumps, measles, and similar inflictions. The\r\n     truth is, I can no more see through Theosophy than I can through\r\n     Christian Science, Spiritualism, Calvinism or any other of the\r\n     theories, so I shall have to go on knocking away to remove the\r\n     obstructions in the road of us mortals while in these bodies and on\r\n     this planet; and leave Madam Besant and you and all who have\r\n     entered into the higher spheres, to revel in things unknown to\r\n     me.... I will join you at Mrs. Miller's Saturday, and we'll chat\r\n     over men, women and conditions--not theories, theosophies and\r\n     theologies, they are all Greek to me.\r\n\r\nThere had been a question after the late election in Idaho whether the\r\nsuffrage amendment required a majority of all the votes cast, or only a\r\nmajority of those cast on the amendment. If the former, then it was\r\ndefeated. The case was carried to the supreme court, which put the\r\nlatter construction on the law. Miss Anthony wrote to the judges, Isaac\r\nN. Sullivan, Joseph W. Huston, Ralph P. Quarles, (John T. Morgan\r\nretired):\r\n\r\n     On behalf of the suffrage women of the United States, I thank you\r\n     for the decision which you have rendered. I had studied over the\r\n     clause a great deal and felt that if your judgments were biased by\r\n     the precedents and prejudices which had controlled the decisions of\r\n     the Supreme Courts of the United States, and of the different\r\n     States, upon the extension of rights to women, you certainly would\r\n     give the narrow interpretation. Instead of that, for the first time\r\n     in the history of our judiciary, the broadest and most liberal\r\n     interpretation possible has been given.\r\n\r\nThe Kentucky Daughters of the American Revolution, who were marking\r\nhistoric spots, she advised as follows:\r\n\r\n     I hope in your selections you will be exceedingly careful to\r\n     distinguish those actions in which our Revolutionary mothers took\r\n     part. Men have been faithful in noting every heroic act of their\r\n     half of the race, and now it should be the duty, as well as the\r\n     pleasure, of women to make for future generations a record of the\r\n     heroic deeds of the other half. It is a splendid thing for your\r\n     association to devote the Fourth of July to a commemoration of\r\n     women. If I had the time, I too might be one of the\r\n     \"Daughters,\"[130] for my Grandfather Read enlisted and fought on\r\n     the heights of Quebec and at the battles of Bennington and\r\n     Ticonderoga; but I have been, and must continue to be, so busy\r\n     working to secure to the women of this day the paramount right for\r\n     which the Revolutionary War was waged, that I can give neither time\r\n     nor money to associations of women for any other purpose, however\r\n     good it may be.\r\n\r\nWhen the answer came that they were doing the very thing that she\r\nwished, she replied:\r\n\r\n     I am delighted; for however heroic our pioneer fathers may have\r\n     been, our pioneer mothers, in the very nature of things, must have\r\n     braved all the hardships of the men by their side with the added\r\n     one of bearing and rearing children when deprived of even the vital\r\n     necessities of maternity. Self-government is as necessary for the\r\n     best development of women as of men. Sentiment never was and never\r\n     can be a guarantee for justice, but with equal political power\r\n     women will be able to secure justice for themselves. We have had\r\n     chivalry and sentiment from the beginning of time, with some\r\n     privileges granted as a favor. We now demand rights, guaranteed to\r\n     us by codes and constitutions; and if their possession shall\r\n     forfeit us gallantry, we will make the best of it. But I do not\r\n     believe woman's utter dependence on man wins for her his respect;\r\n     it may cause him to love and pet her as a child, but never to\r\n     regard and treat her as a peer.\r\n\r\nTo Prof. C. Howard Young, of Hartford, Conn., for thirteen years an\r\ninvalid and yet an ardent advocate of woman suffrage, she wrote: \"I want\r\nyou to feel that the dollar you have sent from year to year all this\r\ntime for your membership in the national association has helped bring to\r\nus Idaho, for our organization committee's work in that State was a\r\nlarge factor in securing the victory. Every one who gives a dollar helps\r\ndo the work where it is most needed to gain the practical result.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are self-explanatory:\r\n\r\n     The vast majority of women easily can have their sympathies drawn\r\n     upon to help personal and public charities, while very few are\r\n     capable of seeing that the cause of nine-tenths of all the\r\n     misfortunes which come to women, and to men also, lies in the\r\n     subjection of woman, and therefore the important thing is to lay\r\n     the axe at the root. Now, my dear, if you and all the women who are\r\n     working for the different charities and reforms of your city, had\r\n     the right to vote, how long do you suppose the brothels and\r\n     gambling houses would be allowed to keep their doors open? Do you\r\n     believe that if women could vote for every officer whose duty it is\r\n     to enforce the laws, these dens would be licensed, or if not\r\n     absolutely licensed, would be allowed to run year in and year out\r\n     merely by the payment of fines from time to time? How long do you\r\n     think our streets would be infested with men walking up and down\r\n     seeking whom they might devour, and with women doing the same?\r\n     While some of you must work, as you are doing, giving heart and\r\n     soul to the mitigation of the horrors of our semi-barbaric\r\n     conditions, I must strike at the cause which produces them.\r\n\r\nTo the women of Kansas:\r\n\r\n     I hope your State association won't do the foolish thing of wasting\r\n     your time in asking the legislature to pass a law granting\r\n     \"presidential\" suffrage to women. Our chances in your State have\r\n     been postponed, if not absolutely killed, because of municipal\r\n     suffrage, and now if you should induce your legislature to give\r\n     \"presidential\" suffrage and the women should thwart the men's\r\n     wishes in their votes for President, as they already have done with\r\n     their limited franchise, you would be doomed never to get the right\r\n     to vote for congressmen, governor and legislators. I wish women\r\n     never would ask for any but full suffrage; and also that they would\r\n     stop asking the legislatures to submit an amendment to the voters,\r\n     until they have created public sentiment enough to get at least one\r\n     of the leading parties to stand for it from year to year. We have\r\n     been working at the top with the members of legislatures,\r\n     delegates to conventions, etc., too long; it is now time to begin\r\n     at the bottom with the voting precincts. Nothing short of this\r\n     should be considered organization.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony received many poems every year from admiring friends of\r\nboth sexes. This acknowledgment of one raises the suspicion that she was\r\nnot so appreciative as she might have been: \"I find in a very handsome\r\nlavender envelope a poem inscribed on lavender paper, addressed to Susan\r\nB. Anthony. Since I know nothing of the merits of poetry, I am not able\r\nto pass any opinion upon this, but I can see that 'reap' and 'deep,'\r\n'prayers' and 'bears,' 'ark' and 'dark,' 'true' and 'grew' do rhyme, and\r\nso I suppose it is a splendid effort, but if you had written it in plain\r\nprose, I could have understood it a great deal better and read it a\r\ngreat deal more easily. Nevertheless, I am thankful to you for poetizing\r\nover me--although the fact is that I am the most prosaic, matter-of-fact\r\ncreature that ever drew the breath of life.\"\r\n\r\nA relative in California wrote that \"God would punish the people in that\r\nState who worked against the woman suffrage amendment,\" and Miss Anthony\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n     It is hardly worth while for you or anybody to talk about \"God's\r\n     punishing people.\" If He does, He has been a long time about it in\r\n     a good many cases and not succeeded in doing it very thoroughly. He\r\n     certainly didn't punish the liquor dealers of San Francisco;\r\n     instead of that, He let them rejoice over us women because of their\r\n     power to cheat us out of right and justice. I think it is quite\r\n     time, at least for anybody who has Anthony blood in her, to see\r\n     that God allows the wheat and the tares to grow up together, and\r\n     that the tares frequently get the start of the wheat and kill it\r\n     out. The only difference between the wheat and human beings is that\r\n     the latter have intellect and ought to combine and pull out the\r\n     tares, root and branch. Instead of that, good men stay away from\r\n     the ballot-box or else form third, fourth and forty-'leventh\r\n     parties, thus leaving the liquor men and vicious elements, who\r\n     always know enough to stand together, a balance of power on the\r\n     side of the candidate or the party that will do most for their\r\n     interests. If the good men were as bright as the bad men, they\r\n     would pull together instead of separately.\r\n\r\nTo the Jewish Woman's Council: \"From day to day I read the press reports\r\nof your meetings, and was pleased to see how successful they were;\r\nespecially was I glad at the answer one of your women made to the\r\ncriticism of your holding a meeting on Sunday. It is time to teach some\r\nof our Protestant women that it is just as worthy to do a good thing on\r\nSunday as on Monday or any other day in the week, and no worse to do a\r\nbad one. They should learn also that they have no more right to ask you\r\nto hold their Sunday sacred than you have to demand that they shall\r\nobserve your Jewish Sabbath.\"\r\n\r\nSome California women wrote her that the politicians were advising them\r\nto ask for \"educated and property suffrage,\" and she replied:\r\n\r\n     I should answer them that it is quite difficult enough for women to\r\n     push their demand for enfranchisement on an _equal_ basis with men.\r\n     They all know there is not a man who has any political aspirations\r\n     or a party which hopes for success, that would take a public stand\r\n     in favor of such a measure as they wish us to adopt. I do not agree\r\n     with them that we have too many voters now. Instead of that, I say\r\n     we have just half enough, for a majority of the opinions of all the\r\n     people combined is sure to be better than the opinions of any one\r\n     class. They call it a \"mistake\" giving to poor and uneducated men\r\n     the right to vote; whereas, the greatest wrongs in our government\r\n     are perpetrated by rich men, the wire-pulling agents of the\r\n     corporations and monopolies, in which the poor and the ignorant\r\n     have no part.\r\n\r\n     No, they can not persuade me that it would be a right or even a\r\n     politic thing to ask that only educated, tax-paying women be\r\n     enfranchised. It would antagonize not only every man who had\r\n     neither property nor education but also every one whose wife had\r\n     neither, and all such would vote against the enfranchisement of the\r\n     rich and educated women. You can not start a demand for any sort of\r\n     restrictive qualification for women which will not lose more votes\r\n     for the measure in one direction than it can possibly gain in\r\n     another.\r\n\r\nThe habit of many women of continually intruding their religious beliefs\r\ninto their public work was a great annoyance to Miss Anthony. To a\r\nprominent speaker on the Prohibition platform with whom she was well\r\nacquainted, she wrote: \"It seems to me that by your using constantly the\r\nwords 'God' and 'Jesus' as if they were material beings, when to you\r\nthey are no longer such, you impress upon your audience, grounded as the\r\nvast majority yet are in the old beliefs, that you still hold to the\r\nidea of their personality. The world, especially women, love to cling to\r\na personal, material help--God a strong man, Jesus a loving man.\" And\r\nthen a little further on, referring to the common habit of regarding\r\nphysical misfortunes as the punishment of God, she said: \"God is not\r\nresponsible for our human ills and we should not believe or disbelieve\r\nin Him on account of our aches and pains. It surely is not the good\r\npeople who escape bodily ailments. Certain fixed laws govern all, and\r\nthose who come nearest to obeying these laws will suffer least; but even\r\nthen we must suffer for the failures of our ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the leading women in a State where a suffrage amendment was\r\npending, wrote her that she felt sure the Lord would interpose in its\r\nbehalf and she should try to influence the voters by prayer. In response\r\nMiss Anthony said:\r\n\r\n     I think you do not fully realize that the vast majority of the men\r\n     whom you have to convert to suffrage, neither know nor care whether\r\n     you and the rest of the women who want to vote, are especially\r\n     inspired by God to make the demand. Those who are good Methodists\r\n     like yourself ought to believe in suffrage already, and therefore\r\n     your appeals are to be made to the men who are not Methodists,\r\n     possibly not even Christians, and would be repelled by your\r\n     presenting any of the religious motives which are so powerful with\r\n     you and other church members. To prevail with the rank and file of\r\n     voters, you must appeal to their sense of justice. I am glad to\r\n     have you tell me personally about your communings with the Lord,\r\n     but for you to give that talk of \"miraculous intervention\" to the\r\n     common run of voters would be, as the Good Book says, \"casting\r\n     pearls before swine.\"\r\n\r\nTo a nephew, D. R. Anthony, Jr., and his bride on the day of their\r\nwedding, she telegraphed the beautiful words of Lucretia Mott: \"May your\r\nindependence be equal, your dependence mutual, your obligations\r\nreciprocal.\"\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1897 a great cry was raised about what was called\r\n\"yellow\" journalism, the mischievous sensationalism of certain\r\nmetropolitan newspapers. The matter was taken up by the W. C. T. U. and\r\nMiss Willard sent out an address to prominent women asking that they\r\nshould protest against this journalism and also against such spectacles\r\nas the recent Corbett-Fitzsimmons prize fight. When it reached Miss\r\nAnthony she answered:\r\n\r\n     Your circular letter came duly, proposing that women should refuse\r\n     to patronize the so-called \"yellow\" newspapers, and also protest\r\n     against prize fighting. It seems to me that for the women of the\r\n     country to come out now with their little piping voices, after all\r\n     the great daily papers of the nation have written the strongest\r\n     kind of editorials against both these evils, would be very like the\r\n     caricatures of the old Conkling-Platt fight in the United States\r\n     Senate--the tall Conkling dealing his blow, and the little Platt\r\n     peeping, \"Me, too.\"\r\n\r\n     Instead of going around echoing one or another class of men, it is\r\n     time for women to put their heads together and demand to have their\r\n     opinions counted the same as those of the men who make possible\r\n     \"yellow journalism\" and prize fighting. They who wish may waste\r\n     their time trying to make bricks without straw--to change the\r\n     conditions of society without votes--I shall go on clamoring for\r\n     the ballot and trying not to antagonize any man or set of men.\r\n     Don't you see, if women ever get the right to vote it must be\r\n     through the consent of not only the moral and decent men of the\r\n     nation, but also through that of the other kind? Is it not\r\n     perfectly idiotic for us to be telling the latter class that the\r\n     first thing we shall do with our ballots will be to knock them out\r\n     of the enjoyment of their pet pleasures and vices? If you still\r\n     think it wise to keep on sticking pins into the men whom we are\r\n     trying to persuade to give women equal power with themselves, you\r\n     will have to go on doing it. I certainly will not be one of your\r\n     helpers in that particular line of work.\r\n\r\nIn reading these and scores of similar expressions of wisdom and\r\nphilosophy, one can but echo the words of Rev. Anna Shaw, who wrote to\r\nMiss Anthony: \"Your letters sound like a trumpet blast. They read like\r\nSt. Paul's Epistles to the Romans, so strong, so clear, so full of\r\ncourage.\" Miss Anthony and Miss Willard always continued the best of\r\nfriends, each great enough to respect the other's individuality. In\r\nreply to the above, Miss Willard wrote: \"Dearest Susan, two women as\r\nsettled in their opinions as you and I, show their highest wisdom when\r\nthey mildly agree to differ and go on their way rejoicing, with mutual\r\ngood word, good will, good heart. Ever yours with warm affection.\" A\r\nlittle later Miss Willard added to the official invitations to the\r\nWorld's and the National W. C. T. U. Conventions, her warm personal\r\nrequest for Miss Anthony's presence.\r\n\r\nThere was no end to the invitations which came by every mail: a banquet\r\ngiven by the New York Woman's Press Club; the twenty-fifth anniversary\r\nof the Woman's Club at Orange, N. J.; an anniversary breakfast of\r\nSorosis, at the Waldorf; a reunion of the old Abolitionists in Boston;\r\nthe Pilgrim Mothers' Dinner in the Astor Gallery; the dedication of the\r\nMother Bickerdyke Hospital in Kansas; the opening reception of the\r\nTennessee Centennial--the very answering of them consumed hours of\r\nprecious time.[131] Neither was there any limit to the newspaper\r\nrequests for opinions, such as, \"Do you favor the use of birds for\r\npersonal adornment? Why, or why not?\" \"Christ's message, 'Peace on\r\nearth, good will to men'--what has it done and what does it mean after\r\nnineteen centuries?\" etc. She seldom attempted to answer such queries,\r\nbut her comments while looking them over in her daily mail, if preserved\r\nby stenographer and historian, would make piquant reading.\r\n\r\nAn amusing letter turns up among the almost nine hundred received in\r\n1897, in which a county official, not seventy-five miles from Rochester,\r\nasks these questions: \"In how many cities have you spoken? How many\r\nlectures delivered? Have you ever spoken in Washington before Congress?\r\nHave you ever spoken in Albany before the legislature? How many people\r\nwould you think you had addressed in your lifetime?\" Miss Anthony\r\nresponded: \"It would be hard to find a city in the northern and western\r\nStates in which I have not lectured, and I have spoken in many of the\r\nsouthern cities. I have been on the platform over forty-five years and\r\nit would be impossible to tell how many lectures I have delivered; they\r\nprobably would average from seventy-five to one hundred every year. I\r\nhave addressed the committees of every Congress since 1869, and our New\r\nYork legislature scores of times.\"\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, she never replied to personal attacks, but during\r\n1897 one so unjust and so bitter was made by a disgruntled woman of New\r\nYork City in the St. Louis Republic, that she yielded to the importunity\r\nof friends and answered briefly:\r\n\r\n     I have been an officer in the National Suffrage Association since\r\n     1852, and its president since 1892. During that time I never have\r\n     had one dollar of salary, nor have I ever received any money for my\r\n     suffrage work from this association. I usually am paid for\r\n     lectures by any society which sends for me to come to a special\r\n     place. In all of the laborious State campaigns I have given my\r\n     services without money and without price. The various bequests\r\n     which have been left to me, to use at my discretion, all have been\r\n     appropriated directly to the suffrage cause. Not one officer of the\r\n     national association is or ever has been paid for her services, and\r\n     most of them have contributed many years of hard work and a large\r\n     amount of their own money.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of July the biography was so well advanced that the two\r\nworkers felt entitled to a vacation during midsummer. The completed\r\nchapters were locked securely in the safety deposit vault and, with a\r\nfervent hope that the house would not catch fire and burn up the\r\nunwritten part of the book during their absence, they started, July 15,\r\nfor a little tour, going first to the home of Mr. and Mrs. James Sargent\r\non \"Summerland,\" one of the loveliest of the Thousand Islands. Here Miss\r\nAnthony tried very hard for a whole week to do nothing. Even\r\nletter-writing was laid aside and she sat on the veranda and watched the\r\ngreat steamers and the pleasure boats go up and down the broad St.\r\nLawrence; took long naps in the hammock swayed by the soft breezes;\r\nwandered through the picturesque ravine and along the water's edge; at\r\nevening watched the sun set in gorgeous splendor, leaving a trail of\r\nglory on the waters which slowly faded as the stars came out in the\r\nbeauty of the night and were reflected in the still depths. Every day,\r\nwith host and hostess and the other guests in the house, she boarded the\r\nlittle launch and sailed up the river, winding in and out among those\r\nwonderful islands with their diversity of hotels, clubhouses, elegant\r\nmansions and pretty cottages; but all surpassed by the adornments of\r\nnature, tall trees with luxuriant vines climbing to the very tops, and\r\nthe great rocks of the ages, rent and cleft and covered with mosses and\r\nferns.\r\n\r\nIt was a charming week but, although the stay might have been prolonged\r\nthrough the summer, Miss Anthony was far too busy a woman for much\r\nvisiting, and on the 22d started for her old home at Adams, Mass., where\r\na unique and long anticipated event took place, which will be described\r\nin the next chapter. A number of relatives, who had come from various\r\nparts of the country for this occasion, returned to Rochester with her.\r\nA little trip was made to Geneva to visit with Mrs. Stanton at Mrs.\r\nMiller's, and so the summer sped quickly and pleasantly away.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony attended the Ohio convention at Alliance, October 5, and\r\nwas the guest of Mrs. Emma Cantine. While here, at the request of\r\nPresident Marsh, she addressed the students of Mount Union College on\r\n\"The Progress of Women during my Lifetime.\" She had said again and again\r\nthat she would not leave her work and go to this convention, but when at\r\nlast a telegram was received, \"For heaven's sake come; all depends on\r\nyou\"--she put on her bonnet and went, just as she had done a hundred\r\ntimes before.\r\n\r\nShe spoke, October 20, at the celebration of the hundredth birthday of\r\nRev. Samuel J. May, in the beautiful church erected to his memory in\r\nSyracuse. She had known Mr. May intimately from 1850 to the time of his\r\ndeath, and those who have read the first chapters of this book and seen\r\nwhat he was to her in those early days of abolitionism and woman's\r\nrights when the enemies far outnumbered the friends, can imagine how\r\neloquently she voiced the love and gratitude in her heart.\r\n\r\nThe next evening Miss Anthony left Rochester for ten days at Nashville,\r\nTenn. The Woman's Board had invited a number of national organizations\r\nto hold conventions during the Exposition, and the last week was set\r\napart for the Woman's Council. This was not a suffrage meeting; it was\r\nsimply a national council where each one of the speakers asked for the\r\nsuffrage to enable her association to do its work. Headquarters were at\r\nthe Maxwell House, and the officers and many other notable women came\r\nfrom various parts of the country for the week. The public sessions were\r\nheld in the Woman's Building, which was crowded to its capacity.\r\nAlthough suffrage was a comparatively new subject in this city, the\r\nannouncement of Miss Anthony's address filled the assembly-room and she\r\nwas received with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThey met with a hearty greeting from the people of Nashville. Among the\r\nelegant receptions given in their honor was one by Mr. and Mrs. W. W.\r\nBerry at Vauxhall Place. The president of the Exposition, Mr. John W.\r\nThomas, and his wife gave a handsome entertainment, of which the\r\nAmerican's account said: \"By the hostess stood her honored guest, Miss\r\nSusan B. Anthony, in simple attire. Warm was the reception accorded this\r\ngray-haired woman, and her grand face impressed all with the noble part\r\nshe had played in this century.\" At the close of the council the\r\nvisitors, as the guests of the lady directors, were driven in tally-ho\r\nand carriages to the beautiful country-seat of the president of the\r\nboard, Mrs. Van Leer Kirkman, where they were royally received.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony spoke also before the Liberal Congress of Religions in\r\nsession at this time, and was introduced by the president, Dr. Thomas,\r\nas \"one who had stood for the cause of liberty when it cost something to\r\nstand, and had borne the storm of calumny and abuse for fifty years.\"\r\nWhile she was in Nashville President Erastus M. Cravath, of Fiske\r\nUniversity, called with his carriage and took her to that institution,\r\nwhere she addressed the faculty and 600 students, speaking, by request,\r\non \"The Early Days of Abolitionism.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a day or two at home Miss Anthony attended the New York Suffrage\r\nConvention at Geneva, November 3. Here she made a speech criticising the\r\nwomen of New York City for having gone so actively into partisan\r\npolitics during the recent campaign, although none of the parties\r\nadvocated giving them the right of suffrage, and pointed out the\r\nabsurdity of hoping for \"good government\" from any party until it was\r\nreinforced by the votes of women. The speech created something of a\r\nsensation, and when she reached home a reporter was waiting for her, to\r\nwhom she gave an interview which intensified the original excitement.\r\nNot only did she review the political situation in New York, but she\r\ndeclared also that no movement could succeed unless it were managed by a\r\nso-called \"ring.\" Leaders must be surrounded by those who are in\r\nsympathy with their ideas and willing to carry out their methods, or\r\nnothing can be accomplished. In commenting, the paper quoted the remark\r\nso often made, \"When Susan B. Anthony was born a woman, an adroit\r\nstatesman was lost to the world.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 11 Miss Anthony started on a great swing of western\r\nconventions, or conferences, stopping on her way to the railroad station\r\nto attend the golden wedding reception of her friends of nearly fifty\r\nyears, Dr. and Mrs. Edward M. Moore. These conferences--Miss Anthony,\r\nMrs. Catt, Miss Shaw, speakers--were for the purpose of arousing\r\ninterest and raising money for the suffrage celebration to be held in\r\nWashington in the winter of 1898. They began at Minneapolis and\r\ncontinued for two days each in Madison, Chicago, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo\r\nand Toledo. At the first city Miss Anthony addressed the students of the\r\nState University, introduced by President Cyrus Northrop. A reception\r\nwas given in the public library building by the local Woman's Council.\r\n\r\nAt each of the cities visited the ladies were entertained by prominent\r\nresidents, the audiences were large and appreciative, and the newspapers\r\ncontained long and favorable reports. There was not a discord in the\r\nchorus of pleasant welcome; not a disrespectful word of either the\r\nspeakers or the cause they advocated. The question was treated with the\r\nsame consideration and dignity as others before the public for\r\ndiscussion, and it required no more courage to present it than to talk\r\nof any other reform of the day.\r\n\r\nIf one desire an illustration of the progress made by women during half\r\na century, let him turn to the early chapters of this book and read the\r\nstory of those first meetings where Miss Anthony, rising timidly in her\r\nseat and asking to make a remark, was literally howled down because no\r\nwoman was allowed to speak in public; and then let him read these\r\nclosing chapters of her ovations extending from ocean to ocean. From a\r\ncanvass of New York State in a sleigh, speaking to little handfuls of\r\npeople in country schoolhouses, ridiculed by the newspapers and outlawed\r\nby society--to an endless series of conventions and congresses in all\r\nthe great cities of the country, with no hall large enough to hold the\r\naudiences and with almost the unanimous approval of press and people!\r\nOnly a short period of less than fifty years, scarcely a second in the\r\neons of history, and yet in that brief time a revolution in public\r\nsentiment, an overturning of the customs and prejudices of the ages, the\r\nrelease of womanhood from unknown centuries of bondage!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[128] Among other birthday remembrances were a diamond pin from Miss\r\nShaw, Mrs. Avery, Mrs. Louise Mosher James and Lucy E. Anthony; $50 from\r\nMrs. Gross; many smaller gifts and quantities of flowers.\r\n\r\n[129] During this month a fine medallion of Miss Anthony was made for\r\nthe Political Equality Club of Rochester and put on sale to obtain money\r\nfor the suffrage fund. Some time before, a handsome souvenir spoon was\r\ndesigned by Mrs. Millie Burtis Logan, of Rochester.\r\n\r\n[130] Later Miss Anthony was made honorary member of Irondequoit\r\nChapter, D. A. R. (Rochester).\r\n\r\n[131] Miss Anthony was this year made honorary member of the Cuban\r\nLeague, the Rochester Historical Society, the Ladies of the Maccabees,\r\nand various other organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nHOME LIFE--THE REUNION--THE WOMAN.\r\n\r\n1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unsurpassed powers of endurance, which have enabled Miss Anthony to\r\nwork without ceasing for more than sixty years, are due to her perfect\r\nphysical condition. She comes of a long-lived race, in which\r\ncentenarians have been not unusual. Her paternal grandfather lived past\r\nthe age of ninety-seven, able to oversee his farm to the very last; the\r\ngrandmother lived beyond sixty-seven; both the maternal grandparents\r\ndied in their eighty-fourth year; her father at sixty-nine, and her\r\nmother at eighty-six. She never has abused her inheritance of a fine,\r\nstrong constitution. Travelling so much of the time, she has not been\r\nable to observe regular hours and, being usually entertained in private\r\nfamilies, has not had a choice of food, but nevertheless, as far as\r\npossible, she has observed the laws of health which she made for herself\r\nin youth.\r\n\r\nShe never fails to take each morning, regardless of the weather, a cold\r\nsponge bath from head to foot, followed by a brisk rubbing, which puts\r\nthe skin in excellent condition. She has a good appetite, drinks tea and\r\ncoffee moderately and eats always the simplest food, cereals, bread and\r\nbutter, vegetables, eggs, milk, a little meat once a day, plenty of\r\nfruit at every meal, whatever is in season, and never can be tempted by\r\nrich salads, desserts or fancy dishes. Whenever it is possible she rests\r\na short time after each meal, and lies down for an hour during the\r\nafternoon, even if she can not sleep; retires at nine or ten and rises\r\nat six or seven. She travels by night, when convenient, as she thus can\r\navoid much of the fatigue of the journey. When travelling in the daytime\r\nshe reads very little, never writes or dictates letters on the train, as\r\nmany busy people do, but makes herself comfortable and dozes and rests.\r\n\r\nAn invariable rule, with which nothing is allowed to interfere, is\r\nplenty of fresh air and exercise, and she regards these as the\r\nmainspring of her long years of health and activity. If she has been on\r\nthe cars all day, she walks from the station to her stopping-place.\r\nAfter a speech, she walks home. When in Rochester she often writes until\r\nnearly 10 o'clock at night, then puts on a long cloak, ties a scarf over\r\nher head, goes out to the mail box, and walks eight or ten blocks,\r\nreturning in a warm glow; gives herself a thorough rubbing, and is ready\r\nfor a night's rest in a room where the window is open at all seasons.\r\nThe policemen are accustomed to the late pedestrian and often speak a\r\nword of greeting as she passes. It is not an unusual thing for her to\r\ntake up a broom, when it has been snowing all the evening, and sweep the\r\nwalks around and in front of the house, just before going to bed. While\r\nnot an adherent of any special \"sciences\" or \"cures,\" she believes\r\nthoroughly in not dwelling upon either mental or bodily ills; giving\r\ndisagreeable things and people only such attention as is absolutely\r\nnecessary, and then putting them out of mind; observing the laws of\r\nhygiene with regard to the body and then banishing it also from the\r\nthoughts. Over and above all else is she an advocate of work, employment\r\nfor mind and body, as a means of salvation.\r\n\r\nIn dress Miss Anthony is extremely particular. She considers it poor\r\neconomy to wear cheap material, always buys the best fabrics, linings\r\nand trimmings, and employs a competent dressmaker. She has one gown a\r\nyear and often this is a present from some loving friend. While she\r\nwears only black silk or satin in public, she loves color and her house\r\ndress is usually maroon or soft cardinal. Her laces and few pieces of\r\njewelry are gifts from women. The slender little ring, worn on the\r\n\"wedding finger,\" was placed there thirty years ago by her devoted\r\nfriend, Dr. Clemence Lozier. She never in a lifetime has changed the\r\nstyle of wearing her hair, once dark brown, glossy and abundant, now\r\nthin and fine and shining like spun silver, which is always evenly\r\nparted, combed over the ears and coiled low at the back, thus showing\r\nthe fine contour of her head. In all the details of the toilet she is\r\nmost fastidious, and a rent, a missing button or a frayed edge is\r\nconsidered almost an unpardonable sin.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony attends Unitarian church but retains her membership in the\r\nSociety of Quakers. On the rare occasions when she needs a physician,\r\nshe consults some woman of the homeopathic school, but she is opposed to\r\nmuch medicine, believing that proper diet and exercise are the best cure\r\nfor most maladies. Although pleased always to welcome callers, she makes\r\nfew visits, except to the faithful friends of olden times whose names so\r\noften have been mentioned in these pages. She finds the days all too\r\nshort and too few for the great work whose demands increase with every\r\nyear. While Miss Anthony feels an abiding interest in household affairs,\r\nthe details and management necessarily devolve upon her sister Mary, who\r\nalso looks carefully after the finances, to see that the modest income\r\nis not all appropriated to the cause of woman suffrage. In matters of a\r\nmaterial nature she is the needed complement to the life of her gifted\r\nsister. On all vital questions, suffrage, religion, the various reforms,\r\nthe two are in perfect accord and, as they sit together in the quiet\r\nhome for the usual twilight chat before the lamps are lighted, there is\r\nnone of that dwelling in the past, to which old people are so prone, but\r\nall is of the present, the live topics of the day, and the plans and\r\nhopes which they share alike.\r\n\r\nThe Anthony home in Rochester stands in Madison street, one of the\r\nnicely paved, well-shaded avenues in the western part of that beautiful\r\ncity. It is a plain, substantial two-and-a-half story brick house of\r\nthirteen rooms, with modern conveniences, and belongs to Miss Mary. It\r\nis furnished with Quakerlike simplicity but with everything necessary to\r\nmake life comfortable. In the front parlor are piano, easy chairs and\r\nmany pictures and pieces of bric-a-brac, given by friends. Over the\r\nmantel hangs a fine, large painting of the Yosemite, presented to Miss\r\nAnthony in 1896 by William Keith, the noted artist of California.\r\nBeneath it stand three fine photographs, Mary Wollstonecraft, Lucretia\r\nMott and Frederick Douglass. Between the windows is the very mahogany\r\ntable upon which were written the call and resolutions for the first\r\nwoman's rights convention ever held--the gift of Mrs. Stanton. In the\r\nback parlor the most conspicuous object is the library table strewn with\r\nthe papers and magazines which come by every mail. This is surrounded\r\nwith arm-chairs, tempting one to pause awhile and enjoy this luxury of\r\nliterature. On one side are the bookcases, and on the walls large\r\nengravings of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and a handsome\r\ncopy of Murillo's Madonna, while in one corner stands the mother's\r\nspinning-wheel. Opening out of this room is Miss Mary's study, the big\r\ndesk filled with work pertaining to the Political Equality Club of 200\r\nmembers, whose efficient president she has been for a number of years;\r\nand here she spends several hours every day looking after her own work\r\nand relieving her sister of a part of hers. There is a sewing-machine\r\nhere also, and a big, old-fashioned haircloth sofa, suggesting a nap and\r\na dream of bygone days.\r\n\r\nIn the dining-room is a handsomely carved mahogany sideboard, a family\r\nheirloom, containing china and silver which belonged to mother and\r\ngrandmother, and here hang very old steel engravings of Washington and\r\nLincoln. The large, light kitchen, with its hard coal range, is a\r\nfavorite apartment, and Miss Anthony especially enjoys sitting there in\r\na low rocking-chair while she reads the morning paper. The front room\r\nupstairs, with little dressing-room attached, is the guest chamber. It\r\ncontains a great chest of drawers, a dressing-table and mirror which\r\nwere part of the mother's wedding outfit over eighty years ago, a\r\nmahogany bedstead and a modern writing-desk and rocking-chairs. On the\r\nwalls are several paintings, the work of loved hands long since at rest,\r\nand two engravings, over one hundred years old, such as used to hang in\r\nevery Abolitionist's parlor in early days. They are copies of paintings\r\nby G. Morland, engraved in 1794, by \"J. R. Smith, King St., Covent\r\nGarden, engravers to H. R. H. the Prince of Wales.\" One is entitled\r\n\"African Hospitality,\" and represents a ship wrecked off the coast of\r\nAfrica with the white passengers rescued and tenderly cared for by the\r\nnatives; the other is named \"The Slave Trade,\" and shows these same\r\nnegroes loaded with chains and driven aboard ship by the white men whom\r\nthey had saved. These pictures have little meaning to the present\r\ngeneration, but one can imagine how they must have fired the hearts of\r\nthose who were laboring to eradicate the curse of slavery from the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nBack of the guest chamber, in this interesting home, is Miss Mary's\r\nsleeping-room, with quaint old furniture and family pictures; then the\r\nmaid's room, another guest chamber and, in the southwest corner, next\r\nthe bathroom, the pleasant bedroom of Miss Anthony with the pictures of\r\nthose she loves best, and the dresser littered with the little toilet\r\narticles of which she is very fond. The most attractive room in the\r\nhouse, naturally, is Miss Anthony's study in the south wing on the\r\nsecond floor. It is light and sunshiny and has an open gas fire. Looking\r\ndown from the walls are Benjamin Lundy, Garrison, Phillips, Gerrit\r\nSmith, Frances Wright, Ernestine L. Rose, Abby Kelly Foster, Harriet\r\nBeecher Stowe, Lucy Stone, Lydia Maria Child and, either singly or in\r\ngroups, many more of the great reformers of the past and present\r\ncentury. On one side are the book shelves, with cyclopedia, histories\r\nand other volumes of reference; on another an inviting couch, where the\r\nbusy worker may drop down for a few moment's repose of mind and body. By\r\none window is the typewriter, and by the other the great desk weighted\r\nwith letters and documents.\r\n\r\nEach morning, as soon as the postman arrives, Miss Anthony sits down at\r\nher desk and, going over the piles of letters, puts to one side those\r\nwhich can wait, dictates replies to those requiring the longest answers\r\nand, while they are being typewritten, plunges with her pen into the\r\nrest. Many hours every day and often into the night she writes steadily,\r\nbut the pile never diminishes. As president of the National-American\r\nAssociation not only must she direct the work for suffrage, which is\r\nbeing carried on in all parts of the country to a much greater extent\r\nthan the public imagines, but she also must keep in touch with the\r\nhundreds of individuals each of whom is helping in a quiet but effective\r\nway. There are few days that do not bring requests from libraries,\r\nassociations, colleges, high schools or clubs for literature and other\r\ninformation concerning woman suffrage, which is now the subject of\r\ndebate from the great universities down to the cross roads schoolhouse.\r\nIn past years libraries have been very deficient in matter upon this\r\nquestion because there was no general call for it, but now the demand is\r\nso large that it scarcely can be supplied, and all instinctively turn to\r\nMiss Anthony for information.\r\n\r\nSome idea has been given of the scope of her correspondence of a public\r\nnature, but it hardly would be possible to describe the private letters.\r\nStanding for half a century as the friend and defender of women, and\r\nknown so widely through her travels and newspaper notices, she is\r\noverwhelmed with appeals for advice and assistance. From the number of\r\nwives, and husbands also, who pour the tale of their domestic grievances\r\ninto her ears, she would be fully justified in believing marriage a\r\nfailure. She is daily requested to sign petitions for every conceivable\r\npurpose, and begged for letters of recommendation by people of whom she\r\nnever heard. Women entreat her to obtain positions for their husbands\r\nand children and to help themselves get pensions, or damages, or wages\r\nout of which they have been defrauded. Girls and boys want advice about\r\ntheir plans for the future. Women, and men too, without education or\r\nexperience, insist upon being placed as speakers on the suffrage\r\nplatform. Authors send books asking for a review. People write of their\r\nbusiness ventures, their lawsuits, their surgical operations, their\r\ndiseases and those of all their family, and of every imaginable\r\nhousehold matter. Scores of letters ask for a \"word of greeting\" on all\r\nsorts of occasions. Editors of papers and pamphlets, advocating every\r\nology and ism under the sun, send them with the entreaty that she will\r\nexamine and express an opinion, each insisting that \"it will take only\r\na few hours of her time.\" She is besieged to dress dolls and make aprons\r\nfor fairs, to write her name upon pieces to be used for quilts and\r\ncushions, and to furnish scraps of her gowns for the same purpose.\r\nBabies are named for her and she is asked to send a letter of\r\nacknowledgment and a little keepsake. Requests for autographs outnumber\r\nthe days of the year.\r\n\r\nShe is constantly importuned to examine MSS., and not only to do this\r\nbut to secure a publisher. During the year 1897 one man sent an article\r\nof sixty-eight closely typewritten pages of legal cap, asking that she\r\ngive it a careful reading, revise it, and send it where it would be\r\npublished; and no postage stamps accompanied this nervy request. A woman\r\nwhose grammar and rhetoric were most defective announced that she had\r\nwritten a book called \"The Intemperate Life of my Father;\" also two\r\nstories and a play. She would send all of them to Miss Anthony, to 'fix\r\nup just as if they were her own and help her sell them; she wanted the\r\nproceeds to assist her brothers who had failed in business.' It is a\r\ncommon occurrence for persons to ask, without so much as enclosing a\r\nstamp, that she prepare an address on woman suffrage and send for them\r\nto read as their own production. One enthusiastic poem begins:\r\n\r\n    \"When the grain is ripe we will gather the sheaves,\r\n    And weave a crown for your brow of laurel leaves.\"\r\n\r\nA man from the great Northwest sends a long article entitled, \"Sun and\r\nMoon Bathed in Blood! Ring, Ring the Bells!\" desiring that it be put in\r\nthe \"index of the biography,\" meaning the appendix. One writes: \"You are\r\nsaid to be very good about assisting helpless girls; now you could not\r\nfind one more helpless than I am;\" and then requests that she select,\r\nhave made and pay for a school outfit for her. Another has a great\r\nscheme for starting a \"workingwoman's home\" and wants Miss Anthony to\r\nfurnish the money. The list might be extended almost indefinitely and,\r\nwhile one is amused and disgusted by turns, there are among this vast\r\ncorrespondence many letters which touch the heart. During the tariff\r\ndebate in Congress in 1897 a paragraph was widely published that a tax\r\nwas to be placed on tea, and this note, evidently written by a child,\r\nwas received: \"My mamma goes out to work while I go to school and she\r\nloves her cup of tea. Our groceryman tells us we will have to pay more\r\nfor it now. I have heard how good you are to the poor, do please spare\r\ntime to write to the President and ask him not to make our tea dearer.\r\nTell him to put the tax on beer and whiskey.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony is very conscientious about answering letters, too much so,\r\nher friends think, for she is a slave to her correspondence. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, she reaches the point of exasperation, as when she opened eight\r\npages of a faintly written scrawl beginning, \"My heart goes out to you\r\nin sympathy.\" \"Well, I wish it would go out in blacker ink,\" she\r\nexclaimed, and threw it into the waste-basket. Invitations to lecture\r\nand to attend all sorts of gatherings pour in, and she often says to the\r\nyounger workers, \"If I might but transfer them to you, how much good you\r\ncould accomplish.\" Every mail brings also loving and appreciative\r\nletters which illuminate the whole day, take the sting out of the unkind\r\nones and lighten the burdens never entirely lifted. The women who have\r\ncome into the work in late years continually ask, \"How have you borne it\r\nso long?\" Sometimes when their own endurance ceases they write her that\r\nthey will have to resign, and she makes answer: \"If all the young women\r\nfail, then the octogenarian must work the harder till a new reserve\r\ncomes to the rescue;\" and of course they are ashamed and redouble their\r\nlabors to show their loyalty.\r\n\r\nWith all her hours of toil she is never satisfied with what she has\r\naccomplished, but always feels that she might have done a little more,\r\nthat something or somebody has been neglected. In looking over the\r\nmention made in these chapters of a few of the most valuable gifts and\r\nnoteworthy letters, she said with sadness: \"And no notice has been taken\r\nof the hundreds of little tokens of affection which cost far more of\r\nsacrifice on the part of the givers, and of the thousands of letters\r\nfrom obscure but faithful women, without which I never could have had\r\nthe courage to do my work.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANTHONY FAMILY AT THE REUNION, ADAMS, MASS., JULY 30,\r\n1897.]\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Anthony has remained at home more days in 1897 than in any\r\nprevious year for half a century it has been one of the busiest in\r\nregard to letter-writing. It is the dream of her life to raise a\r\npermanent fund to be placed in the hands of trustees, after the manner\r\nof the famous Peabody fund, the income to be used to further the cause\r\nof woman suffrage. To accomplish this she is exerting her strongest\r\npowers of appeal. During all these years of labor for humanity she has\r\nhad to beg practically every dollar she has used, and she longs to\r\nrelieve the workers of the future from this drudgery and humiliation, by\r\nproviding an assured income, so they may not be obliged to expend half\r\ntheir time and strength in obtaining the money with which to do the\r\nwork. In addition to this Standing Fund, she is endeavoring also to\r\nsecure enough money for the early establishment of a Press Bureau for\r\nthe purpose of taking up and answering, day by day, the false statements\r\nmade in regard to woman suffrage, its ultimate aims and actual results;\r\nto furnish news and arguments where they are desired; and to enlist the\r\nsupport of the press for this question, which is now acknowledged to be\r\none of the leading issues of the day.\r\n\r\nThe event of 1897 which gave Miss Anthony more pleasure than all others,\r\nin fact one of the happiest incidents of her life, was the Anthony\r\nReunion at Adams, Mass., the last of July. The Historical and Scientific\r\nSociety of Berkshire had for many years held an annual meeting at some\r\none of the historic spots for which that county is especially noted. In\r\n1895 this had been held in the dooryard of the old Anthony homestead,\r\nand she had been invited to be present, but was otherwise engaged. It\r\nhad been the custom to eulogize her highly at these gatherings but it\r\nwas determined that now she must come and speak for herself, therefore\r\nthe invitation was repeated for 1896, but then she was in California. In\r\n1897 the letter from the president, A. L. Perry, said: \"The present\r\nwriting is to give you a formal and official invitation, in the name of\r\nthe people of the entire county, whose representatives we are, to be\r\npresent and participate in our next meeting. You may be sure of a warm\r\nwelcome from your old neighbors who remain, and from the generation of\r\nBerkshire people, men and women, now on the stage.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting was to be held in Lee, and she wrote that if they would\r\nagain hold it at the old Anthony homestead she would put aside\r\neverything else and come. She soon received this answer from Rev. A. B.\r\nWhipple: \"It gives me pleasure, as vice-president of the Berkshire\r\nHistorical Society, to inform you that we have decided to gratify your\r\n'bit of sentiment' as well as our own inclination to meet again 'in that\r\nold dooryard,' to do you honor as one of the natives of Berkshire whose\r\nhistoric lives are finding a deserved and permanent record in our\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony ever wanted her friends to share in her joys and was\r\nanxious that everybody should know her friends, so she wrote that she\r\nwould like to have the Berkshire people hear Miss Shaw and others among\r\nthe noted speakers. After some exchange of letters the officers of the\r\nsociety requested her to take charge of the program of the day, and\r\npromised to second all her arrangements. As she always combined business\r\nwith pleasure she appointed a meeting of the national suffrage committee\r\nthat week, and thus brought to Adams her \"body guard,\" Miss Shaw, Miss\r\nBlackwell, Mrs. Catt, Mrs. Avery, Mrs. Upton[132] and, by invitation,\r\nMrs. Sewall, Mrs. Colby and Mrs. Harper. She had decided also to have at\r\nthis time a family reunion, and for many weeks had been writing far and\r\nwide to the Anthonys, the Laphams, the Reads and the Richardsons,\r\nbidding all come to Adams on the 29th of July, and as a result the \"Old\r\nHive\" swarmed as it never had done, even in the early days. She went on\r\na week ahead and joined forces with her cousin, Mrs. Fannie Bates, who\r\nlived in the house. Albert Anthony, another cousin and near neighbor,\r\nput himself, his horses and vehicles at their service; other relatives\r\ncame to their assistance, beds were set up, provisions laid in; and for\r\na week fifteen people picnicked in the old homestead. The overflow was\r\nreceived in the hospitable homes of other relatives in the neighborhood,\r\nand even Hotel Greylock, in the village, was pressed into service to\r\nentertain the guests, who came from Kansas, Illinois, New York,\r\nPennsylvania, New Jersey, New Hampshire and other States.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage committee meetings were held during several days and\r\nevenings preceding the Historical Society celebration. It was a picture\r\nalways to be remembered, that group of distinguished women, standing at\r\nthe very head of the greatest progressive movement of the age, gathered\r\nin serious conclave in those old-fashioned, low-ceiled rooms built over\r\na century ago, concocting schemes which would have filled their Quaker\r\nowners with holy horror. It seemed almost as if they would come back\r\nfrom the dim past to ask what it all meant. And yet, when one recalled\r\nthat the Quakers never commanded their women to keep silence in the\r\nmeeting house, but recognized their full equality there and elsewhere,\r\nand stood for liberty in a world given over to religious and political\r\ntyranny, it seemed indeed most fitting that the representatives of this\r\ngreat association for securing freedom to all, should come together\r\nunder the roof of one of these old Friends. One felt as if the ancient\r\ndoor-latch should lift, and Aunt Hannah, the wise and gentle Quaker\r\npreacher, should glide in and take her seat among these other women whom\r\nthe Spirit also had moved. But the most remarkable feature of this\r\nunique occasion was that the woman presiding over the deliberations of\r\nthis body of reformers, should have carried on her childish games in\r\nthis very room, seventy-five years before, and listened with awe to\r\nparents and grandparents as they discussed the burning questions of\r\nintemperance, slavery and religious intolerance.\r\n\r\nAn unseasonable storm of several days' duration had made it necessary to\r\ntransfer the meeting of the Historical Society to the pavilion in\r\nPlunkett's Park. The ladies of Adams and vicinity, with Mrs. Susan\r\nAnthony Brown at their head, had prepared a bountiful luncheon for the\r\nofficers of the society and the fifty invited guests, and here, at noon\r\non July 29, Miss Anthony sat at the upper end of the long table with\r\nRev. Anna Shaw on one hand and Rev. A. B. Whipple on the other. At the\r\nconclusion of the luncheon, the officers and speakers took seats on the\r\nstage in the large pavilion, which soon was filled with an audience that\r\nhad come from Williamstown, North Adams, Pittsfield, Great Barrington,\r\nLee and other surrounding towns. The Adams Freeman said: \"If the group\r\nof women speakers were brilliant, the audience that honored them, while\r\nless so perhaps in renown, was equal in intellectual attainments. It was\r\na cultured assembly, including the most progressive people of\r\nBerkshire.\"[133]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THE OLD HOMESTEAD, JULY 30, 1897.]\r\n\r\nIn a few words of welcome Rev. Louis Zahner, the Episcopal minister,\r\nspoke of the Anthony family as having laid the foundations of the\r\nschools, the industries and the prosperity of Adams, and of the\r\ncommunity's indebtedness to them for the best it has today. Mr. Whipple,\r\nin a cordial address, then introduced Miss Anthony and placed the\r\nmeeting in her charge. Can any pen describe her pride and happiness in\r\nreturning thus to the loved home of her birth and childhood, to meet\r\nthis warm and appreciative welcome and to introduce in turn her cabinet\r\nof eminent women?\r\n\r\nAfter relating some very interesting recollections of her ancestors and\r\nof early events, which were especially appreciated by the old residents,\r\nshe introduced Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, who said in the course of a\r\ngraceful address:\r\n\r\n     There is no citizen of this great nation who would not be delighted\r\n     with the privilege of visiting these Berkshire hills, famed for\r\n     their beauty, but it is not because of this that most of us have\r\n     made this pilgrimage to Adams; rather have we come with much of\r\n     that spirit which led the thousands upon thousands of Christians in\r\n     the early centuries to Jerusalem, or which later prompted thousands\r\n     of Mohammedans to make their pilgrimage to the city of Mecca. We\r\n     have come to Adams because it is the birthplace of the greatest\r\n     woman of our time.\r\n\r\n     Many centuries ago, on the 15th of February, there was born a man\r\n     whose name is familiar to every school-child throughout the\r\n     civilized world, and yet that man never knew a happy day. He was\r\n     reviled, persecuted, martyred, tried, condemned, and died sorrowful\r\n     and broken-hearted. And what was his offense? He declared that this\r\n     earth turned upon its axis and that it moved around the sun. There\r\n     were no newspapers in that day, but every pulpit thundered its\r\n     denunciation against the great Galileo. When he was condemned to\r\n     die he was compelled to renounce this belief, but under his breath\r\n     he said, \"The world does move!\" A century after he had gone, not a\r\n     pulpit in Christendom, not a scholar, was there but knew that he\r\n     had told the truth.\r\n\r\n     It is a curious coincidence that upon the anniversary of the\r\n     birthday of Galileo there was born Susan B. Anthony. She also\r\n     perceived a great truth and the world did not agree with her. It\r\n     reviled her for the belief she had propounded, but in this century\r\n     she never renounced that belief, but thundered back to the pulpit\r\n     and to the newspapers that the world does move and the time will\r\n     come when women shall be free; the time will come when they shall\r\n     have every right, every privilege, every liberty which any man\r\n     enjoys.... We, today, are making the first pilgrimage to the\r\n     birthplace of Susan B. Anthony, but I prophesy that in another\r\n     quarter of a century there will be many pilgrimages hither, and no\r\n     child will be so illiterate as not to know that in this county it\r\n     was this greatest of American women was born.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel Foster Avery followed with an entertaining account of her\r\ntrip abroad with Miss Anthony and the latter's utter indifference to the\r\ntitles of the nobility. As she never could get them right she discarded\r\nall of them and insisted on calling everybody plain \"Mr.\" and \"Mrs.\" She\r\nthen related this incident:\r\n\r\n     We had in our party for a few weeks a couple of English ladies.\r\n     When driving in Rome, one of them, a great dame of noble lineage,\r\n     was admiring an old palace belonging to some very ancient Roman\r\n     family and made the statement that this same family owned five\r\n     other famous palaces in Italy. Miss Anthony seemed to be making a\r\n     mental calculation, and finally said with enthusiasm, \"What a\r\n     magnificent orphan asylum that would make.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Why, Miss Anthony, do you mean that you would actually turn the\r\n     home of this old family into an orphan asylum?\"\r\n\r\n     \"Yes,\" said she, \"I think about 700 of these little ragamuffins\r\n     could be put in there. Think of the streets just full of them, and\r\n     all these big houses vacant! I don't see a better use to which\r\n     these old palaces could be put.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Upton in her bright, humorous way related some amusing stories\r\nwhich she had heard from her ancestors, who were born in Berkshire, and\r\nadroitly turned them into an argument for woman suffrage. A beautiful\r\npoem was read, entitled \"Pioneers,\" dedicated to Miss Anthony by her old\r\nfriend John M. Thayer, of Rochester. Col. D. R. Anthony created great\r\nmirth by telling among other stories that eighty years ago his father\r\nhad a cotton mill of twenty-six looms; one day all of them suddenly\r\nstopped and, rushing out to ascertain the cause, he found that his wife,\r\nin rinsing her mop in the stream, had stopped the power which moved the\r\nmachinery! He then referred to the Plunkett factories with 2,600 looms,\r\nand the other great mills of Adams, as illustrating the progress of the\r\ncentury. In an address which glowed with beauty and eloquence, Mrs. May\r\nWright Sewall thus compared Miss Anthony's character with the scenes\r\namidst which she was born:\r\n\r\n     We, who own and follow our general, know that she goes where\r\n     Liberty leads, where Justice calls, where Love whispers his divine\r\n     commands; and we have found in her the gravity of your stately\r\n     mountains, the yearning for freedom of your lofty hills lifted\r\n     toward the sky spaces. We have found in her the impetuosity of your\r\n     mountain streams, which, fretting against narrow bounds, broke\r\n     through them, widening and widening ever the channel of the life of\r\n     American womanhood; and so we, who love appropriateness, gaze with\r\n     delight upon this scenery, the environment of her infancy and the\r\n     nurturing influence of her childhood, as a fine illustration of the\r\n     eternal fitness of things.\r\n\r\nOne of the most exquisite addresses of the day was made by Mrs. Clara B.\r\nColby, who said in part:\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony's love of justice links her with the divine. This has\r\n     been her impelling motive, and her patient endurance has been the\r\n     secret of her success. No matter how keen might have been her sense\r\n     of the injustice done to women, no matter how courageously she\r\n     might have set out to right the wrong, had she lacked endurance,\r\n     she had never been the one to lead us to victory. As justice is the\r\n     root of the tree of character, and patience the stalk from which\r\n     all growth proceeds, so tenderness is the outflowering of the\r\n     divinity within. By her tenderness Miss Anthony has made herself\r\n     loved where she might have only been honored.\r\n\r\n     It was perhaps the drop hardest to swallow from the cup of\r\n     bitterness which was ever pressed to the lips of the early woman\r\n     suffragists, that they were destroyers of the home. To Miss\r\n     Anthony, the home and kindred-lover--homeless only for the sake of\r\n     the homes of the mother-half of the race--this must have been\r\n     especially hard to bear. There are such all over the land where she\r\n     has been a tender and sympathetic friend and where she is enshrined\r\n     in the hearts of the homekeepers.... Thus Miss Anthony,\r\n     justice-loving, patient and tender, has erected for herself a\r\n     lasting monument in the hearts of the women of this nation. May the\r\n     time be long deferred when she shall pass from the leadership of\r\n     her now triumphant host, but when that day comes, let there be, as\r\n     she has enjoined upon us, no tears, but only glad thankfulness for\r\n     a great life-work wrought in courage, fidelity and tenderness.\r\n\r\nMrs. Colby urged the Historical Society to purchase the old homestead,\r\nif possible, as a depository not only for relics of the Anthony family\r\nbut for mementoes of suffrage work and workers. No report ever can give\r\nan adequate idea of the eloquence of Anna Shaw, so artistically\r\ndiversified by delicious bits of humor and keen points of satire. A\r\nportion of her address was as follows:\r\n\r\n     Amidst all the eulogy which has surrounded Miss Anthony this\r\n     afternoon, her brother said to me, \"Don't you think they will turn\r\n     Susan's head?\" I answered, \"No, she has had so many years of\r\n     misrepresentation and abuse that if they keep on eulogizing her as\r\n     long as she lives, it won't balance the other side.\" There is no\r\n     danger in this world that the leader of an unpopular cause ever\r\n     will die of overpraise, for, in America as in Jerusalem, the\r\n     prophets of God have always been received with stones. We who know\r\n     her best love her most, and to me the truest and deepest love of my\r\n     existence, since my mother entered the life beyond, is that which I\r\n     cherish for Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\n     The remonstrants today tell us that our movement will destroy the\r\n     affectionate tenderness of the womanly nature and unsex woman until\r\n     she becomes a weak man. I believe in men, and I do not believe that\r\n     all the love, the tenderness, the power to sacrifice is feminine. I\r\n     believe that the love of man is as true and deep and tender as the\r\n     love of woman. I will not accept the theory that \"man is the head\"\r\n     and \"woman is the heart.\" I believe that when God created head and\r\n     heart for the human race He divided them equally and gave man his\r\n     part and woman hers, and both have kept their own all the way down\r\n     the centuries.\r\n\r\n     The part of Miss Anthony's life which is dearest to us is that into\r\n     which she has admitted the few who belong to the sacred inner\r\n     circle, who have seen her toil, her suffering, her soul's anguish\r\n     and travail for the freedom, the larger growth, the diviner\r\n     possibilities of womanhood; and if there is any evidence that\r\n     living in the world, working for its uplift, does not destroy this\r\n     trait in human character, it is shown in the life of Miss Anthony.\r\n     There is no human being whom I have ever known who had more\r\n     tenderness for the erring and greater willingness to overlook the\r\n     frailties of human life. In this she shows that contact with the\r\n     most disagreeable side of the reformer's work, makes the real woman\r\n     not less but more womanly. I believe that if the principles which\r\n     she advocates, the ideals for which she stands, were embodied in\r\n     all womankind, we would have a motherhood diviner than any this\r\n     world has ever known, a motherhood such as God had in his thought\r\n     when he created woman to be the mother of the race....\r\n\r\n     It is not a name we love today, it is not a person we revere, but a\r\n     great, an ideal life of a woman who has battled with the world, who\r\n     has been misunderstood, who has borne its scorn, who has been\r\n     ostracised, and who, in the midst of all, has kept her life sweet,\r\n     her heart young, her love tender; and when the best thing shall be\r\n     said of her which men and women can say, it will be--she was true,\r\n     she was noble, she was woman.\r\n\r\nThe day after the meeting of the Historical Society, occurred the\r\nAnthony Reunion at the old homestead, when eighty of the clan sat down\r\nat the long tables spread in grandfather's room, the keeping-room and\r\nthe weaving-room; and what a dinner the famous cooks of the\r\nAnthony-Lapham-Read-Richardson families had prepared for this great\r\noccasion! Not the least important features were the eighteen apple-pies\r\neaten with the world-renowned Berkshire cheese; and then the sweet bread\r\nand butter, the fried chicken, the baked beans, the rich preserves and\r\ncream, the delicious cake--but why attempt to describe a New England\r\ndinner prepared by New England women? Those who have eaten know what it\r\nis; those who have not, can not be made to understand.\r\n\r\nWhere Susan B. Anthony sat was the head of the table; at her right hand,\r\nthe brother Daniel R.; at her left, the brother Merritt; and close by,\r\nthe quiet, smiling sister Mary; and then all along down the line, the\r\ncousins, the nephews, the nieces, three and four generations, who had\r\njoined so heartily with her for the success of this rare occasion.\r\nBefore the dinner began, Miss Anthony asked that, in accordance with the\r\ncustom of their ancestors, there might be a moment of silent thanks; and\r\nat the close of the meal, when the chatter and mirth were stilled, she\r\narose and in touching words paid tribute to the loved and gone who once\r\nblessed these rooms by their presence. She then called upon the\r\nrepresentatives of the different branches, old and young, who, in prose\r\nor poetry, with wit or pathos, made delightful response.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE QUAKER MEETING HOUSE, ADAMS, MASS. 150 YEARS OLD.\r\nSEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE ANTHONY FAMILY IN THE GROUP OF PIONEERS.]\r\n\r\nAfter all had finished they adjourned to the dooryard and a reception\r\ncommenced which even the roomy old house could not have accommodated.\r\nFor several hours a long line of carriages wound up the hill--the people\r\nof Adams and vicinity coming to pay respect to their illustrious\r\ntownswoman and her relatives and friends. The immediate members of the\r\nfamily were photographed in a group on the old porch, as was also the\r\ndinner party gathered in the historic dooryard. The mountain air was\r\nsweet and invigorating, and the view in every direction most enchanting.\r\nA more picturesque spot scarcely can be imagined: in front, the long\r\nrange of Berkshire hills, a spur of the Green mountains of Vermont whose\r\nfaint outlines are visible in the distance; at the back, glorious \"Old\r\nGreylock,\" the highest peak in the State; at the right, the steep,\r\nwinding road leading down to the village a mile below, through a ravine\r\nperfectly bewildering in its beauty of overhanging trees, moss-grown\r\nrocks and fern-bordered brook tumbling over the massive boulders in its\r\nrapid descent to join the Hoosac; and then united they flow through the\r\npretty town of Adams, turning the countless wheels of the great mills\r\nand factories.\r\n\r\nThe next day after the reunion a merry party of thirty, the guests of a\r\ncousin, William Anthony, started in two great coaches, each drawn by six\r\nhorses, for the all-day trip to the top of Mount Greylock. The gayest\r\nand happiest of them all was Miss Anthony, with her red shawl over her\r\nshoulders, and her heart as light as when she used to climb these\r\nmountainsides, a little, barefooted girl, more than seventy years ago.\r\nSeveral days thereafter were spent visiting the pleasant homes of the\r\nrelatives, and going with her friends to point out the various places of\r\ninterest. Every spot connected with her early life was as sacred to them\r\nas it was dear to her. Together they went to the deserted Quaker meeting\r\nhouse, a century and a half old, and were shown the very spot where sat\r\nthe grandfather, the father, mother and little ones; and the raised\r\nbench occupied by the grandmother, who was a \"high-seat Quaker,\" and\r\nAunt Hannah Hoxie, the preacher. They strolled through the little\r\ngraveyard, with its lines of unmarked mounds. They visited the site of\r\nthe old mill, built by Daniel Anthony at the very beginning of the\r\nmanufacturing industry, where now only a few sunken stones mark the\r\nfoundation. They rested beneath the great trees which stand like\r\nsentinels in front of the girlhood home of the mother, the house long\r\nsince crumbled away. They gazed curiously at the ancient Bowen's Tavern,\r\nthe favorite stopping-place of the mountaineers in early days.\r\n\r\nAnd then they went with Miss Anthony into her own old home. They stepped\r\nreverently into the very room where she was born. They climbed to the\r\ngarret and she pointed out the exact spot by the tiny window where she\r\nused to sit with her simple playthings. They stood with her by the\r\nlittle stream which still ran merrily through the dooryard, and listened\r\nwith misty eyes as she recalled many touching incidents of days long\r\npast; but, however her own heart might have ached with tender\r\nrecollections, there were no words of vain longing, no useless tears for\r\nthose who had fulfilled their mission and passed away, leaving to her\r\ntheir legacy of hope and courage and determination. Strong, brave and\r\ncheerful, she honored the memory of the dead in showing herself by her\r\nworks to be the worthy descendant of a noble race. And here, where the\r\nstory of this pure, single-hearted, self-sacrificing life began, it\r\nshall be ended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe usual fate of reformers is \"praise when the ear has grown too dull\r\nto hear, fame when the heart it should have thrilled is numb.\" Seldom it\r\nis, indeed, that they live to see the fulfillment of the end for which\r\nthey labored, and even recognition usually is deferred until it can be\r\ngiven only to a memory, but there are a few happy exceptions. While true\r\nreformers seek no personal reward, those who love them rejoice when they\r\nare spared to receive the honors they have earned. Susan B. Anthony's\r\nself-imposed task, for almost half a century, has been to secure equal\r\nrights for women--social, civil and political. When she began her\r\ncrusade, woman in social life was \"cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,\" to an\r\nextent which scarcely can be conceived by the present independent and\r\nself-reliant generation; in law she was but little better than a slave;\r\nin politics, a mere cipher. Today in society she has practically\r\nunlimited freedom; in the business world most of the obstacles have been\r\nremoved; the laws, although still unjust in many respects, have been\r\nrevolutionized in her favor; in four States women have the full\r\nfranchise, in one the municipal ballot, in twenty-five a vote on school\r\nquestions, and in four others some form of suffrage; while in each\r\ncampaign their recognition as a political factor grows more marked. Miss\r\nAnthony's part in securing these concessions may be judged from the\r\nrecord of these pages. She is the only woman who has given her whole\r\ntime and effort to this one end, with no division of interest in behalf\r\nof husband and children, no diversion of other public questions. Is\r\nthere an example in all history of either man or woman who devoted half\r\na century of the hardest, most persistent labor for one reform?\r\n\r\n\"Of the dead naught shall be spoken except good,\" is a rule so\r\nuniversally observed that post mortem compliments have little weight,\r\nbut when beautiful things are said of those who still live and toil,\r\nthey are full of meaning. Not only is it a delight to her\r\ncontemporaries, but it will be a pleasure to future generations who\r\nshall read her history, that Miss Anthony lived to receive her meed of\r\nappreciation. While not all of even the enlightened minds of today have\r\nprogressed far enough to accept her doctrine of perfect equality, which\r\nwill be universally admitted by the next generation, there are few who\r\ndo not recognize and honor the splendid character of the woman and the\r\nservice she has rendered. Just as these closing words are being written,\r\nthe State superintendent of public works, George W. Aldridge, announces\r\nthat he has ordered her face to be carved in the Capitol at Albany, one\r\nof the magnificent public buildings of the world. Here, wrought in\r\nimperishable stone, amidst those of the country's greatest warriors and\r\nstatesmen, it will look down forever upon that grand staircase whose\r\nmarble steps were so many times pressed by her weary feet, as she made\r\nher annual pilgrimage to plead for liberty.\r\n\r\nThe sweetest strains in this great oratorio are the tributes of women\r\nvoicing their love and gratitude. They come from those in all the walks\r\nof life, and a distinguishing feature is that they who have known her\r\nlongest and best are most loyal and devoted. The secret of this is\r\nperfectly expressed by May Wright Sewall, when she says:\r\n\r\n     Mortals with all their consciousness of their own infirmities are\r\n     exacting of one another. It is a proof of the infinite\r\n     possibilities involved in the human soul, and a foundation for the\r\n     infinite hope which sustains us, that we are satisfied with nothing\r\n     less than perfection in other people. Is a woman great? To please\r\n     us she must be also good. Is a woman both great and good? We are\r\n     not satisfied unless she be likewise loving and lovable. No one can\r\n     come near to the life of Miss Anthony without realizing how\r\n     responsive she is to personal needs; how lively in her sympathies;\r\n     how instinctive her outreaching of the helping hand. The same\r\n     fidelity and single-minded loyalty which have characterized her\r\n     public career, distinguish her in all private relations. Others may\r\n     forget us in our griefs, she never forgets. Others may forget us in\r\n     our pleasures, she never forgets.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed true that Miss Anthony never forgets. In her letters to\r\nhundreds of people, she recollects always to send a message to the\r\ndifferent members of the family, to refer to some agreeable incident of\r\ntheir acquaintance, and to express either pleasure or regret over\r\npersonal affairs which any one else would have failed to remember amidst\r\nsuch a pressure of work and responsibility.\r\n\r\nAfter an unbroken friendship of twenty-five years, Frances E. Willard,\r\nherself one of the grandest women of the century, paid this beautiful\r\ntribute in December, 1897:\r\n\r\n     Ever since I \"came to myself\" my love and loyalty have enveloped\r\n     the name, Susan B. Anthony. I look upon her as that figure full of\r\n     courage, resource and dignity which will yet be enshrined in the\r\n     admiring affection of the whole republic, even as it already has\r\n     been for so long in that of thoughtful women. Others have done\r\n     nobly and we count over their names with devout remembrance and\r\n     gratitude, but Susan B. Anthony by reason of her heroic\r\n     self-sacrifice, her lonely life, her changeless devotion, her\r\n     disregard for money and position, her concentration of purpose and\r\n     universal good will, has made for herself a place on the highest\r\n     pedestal in America's pantheon of women.\r\n\r\n     We do not forget \"the slings and arrows\" of the earlier time, now\r\n     that she is justly honored in these years of greater intelligence\r\n     and progress; we do not forget that high sense of personal\r\n     integrity which led her to pay off the debts on The Revolution,\r\n     although no legal obligation rested upon her to do so; we do not\r\n     forget her testing of an unjust law in the great \"case\" in\r\n     Rochester; we do not forget that (jointly with her great associate,\r\n     Mrs. Stanton) she prepared for us that invaluable historic record\r\n     of the suffrage movement from its earliest inception; we do not\r\n     forget the untiring labors which have carried her, from youth to\r\n     age, into every nook and corner of the Union; and many of us are\r\n     cognizant of unnumbered acts of personal kindness toward women in\r\n     need who cherish her as if she were their sister or their mother.\r\n     Although the press once misrepresented her, it would hardly venture\r\n     to do so now, for her standing with the public is such that not to\r\n     know Miss Anthony argues one's self unknown, and to vilify her\r\n     argues one's self a villain.\r\n\r\n     Blessed Sister Susan, accept the homage of one whom you have\r\n     cheered and comforted, and who rejoices to believe that the loving\r\n     friendship begun here shall grow and deepen in the bright light of\r\n     that happier world where there is no injustice, and where we have\r\n     abundant reason to believe that women will stand on a plane of\r\n     perfect equality.\r\n\r\nA number of years ago, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, in her own unsurpassed\r\nbeauty of language, said:\r\n\r\n     I will attempt no analysis of one as dear to me as those of my own\r\n     household. In an intimate friendship of many years, without a break\r\n     or shadow; in daily consultation, sometimes for months together\r\n     under the same roof, often in circumstances of great trial and\r\n     perplexity, I can truly say that Susan B. Anthony is the most\r\n     charitable, self-reliant, magnanimous human being that I ever knew.\r\n\r\n     As I recall the honesty and heroism of her public life; her\r\n     tenderness and generous self-sacrifice to friends in private; her\r\n     spontaneous good will towards her worst enemies, a new hope kindles\r\n     within me for womankind--a hope that by giving some high purpose to\r\n     their lives, all women may be lifted above the petty envy,\r\n     jealousy, malice and discontent that now poison so many hearts\r\n     which might, in healthy action, overflow with love and helpfulness\r\n     to all humanity. Miss Anthony's grand life is a lesson to all\r\n     unmarried women, showing that the love-element need not be wholly\r\n     lost if it is not centered on husband and children. To live for a\r\n     principle, for the triumph of some reform by which all mankind are\r\n     to be lifted up--to be wedded to an idea--may be, after all, the\r\n     holiest and happiest of marriages.\r\n\r\nIn the twilight of age, when Mrs. Stanton prepared for future\r\ngenerations the Reminiscences of her life and work of fourscore years,\r\nshe wrote to her old friend: \"The current of our lives has run in the\r\nsame channel so long it can not be separated, and my book is as much\r\nyour story as, I doubt not, yours is mine;\" and when it was ended she\r\nplaced upon it the inscription, \"I dedicate this volume to Susan B.\r\nAnthony, my steadfast friend for half a century.\"\r\n\r\nSteadfast! No other word so fitly defines the keystone of the arch of\r\nnoble attributes upon which this heroic life is founded--as constant to\r\na principle as to a friendship. There is nothing of the martyr in Miss\r\nAnthony's nature and she refuses to consider herself in the light of a\r\nvicarious sacrifice. \"I do not look back upon a hard life,\" she says; \"I\r\nhave been continually at work because I enjoyed being busy. Had this\r\nnever-ending toil made me wretched in mind or body, I have no doubt that\r\nin some way I should have gotten out of it.\" \"What thanks did you\r\nreceive for the stand you made?\" once was asked her. \"I had my own\r\nthanks for retaining my self-respect,\" was the reply. Again one\r\ninquired, \"Did you not grow discouraged in those olden times?\" \"Never,\"\r\nshe answered; \"I knew that my cause was just, and I was always in good\r\ncompany.\" Her character, instead of growing embittered by the hard\r\nexperiences of early days, has been sweetened and strengthened by the\r\nhigh moral purpose which has dominated her life. She is a philanthropist\r\nin her love of mankind and her work for humanity, but she is governed by\r\nphilosophy rather than emotion, ever examining causes and effects by the\r\npure light of reason and logic.\r\n\r\nSusan B. Anthony has been called the Napoleon of the woman suffrage\r\nmovement and, in the planning of campaigns and the boldness and daring\r\nof carrying them forward, there may be the qualities of that famous\r\ngeneral, but in character and principles the comparison fails utterly.\r\nShe has been termed the Gladstone among women, and in statesmanlike\r\nability and long years of distinguished service, there may be points of\r\nresemblance, but she would repudiate the sacrifice of justice to party\r\nexpediency, oftentimes charged against the noted English politician. It\r\nhas been said that she has been the great Liberator of women, as Lincoln\r\nwas of the negroes. There is indeed something in her countenance and\r\nmanner which reminds one of Lincoln, the same unconscious dignity, the\r\nsame rugged endurance, the same strong, resolute face, softened by lines\r\nof weariness and care and spiritualized by an expression of infinite\r\npatience and indescribable pathos. She has not, however, the\r\nconservatism, the forbearance, the reverence for existing laws and\r\nconstitutions, which made Lincoln slow to act and tolerant almost to the\r\npoint of criticism.\r\n\r\nShe has been described as being to the cause of woman's emancipation,\r\nwhat Garrison was to that of the slave. She has, perhaps, more of the\r\ncharacteristics of Garrison than of the other three conspicuous figures\r\nof the century. His motto, \"No Compromise,\" has been her watchword. Like\r\nGarrison, she strikes a body-blow straight from the shoulder. She\r\nrecognizes no such word as expediency and accepts no halfway measures.\r\nTheoretically a non-resistant, she fights to the last ditch and never\r\naccepts a defeat as final. She has the natural gift of selecting always\r\nthe strongest word, and the power of carrying conviction to her\r\naudience. She is conventional in outward observances, but most radical\r\nin thought and speech. She detests all forms of cruelty and oppression,\r\nbut it is the action, not the person, that she censures, and she is most\r\ncharitable in excuses for the faults and failings of others. She bears\r\nthe ills of life with cheerful fortitude, and accepts the blessings with\r\nfine humility. There is no need of comparison. She has her own strong\r\nindividuality, which has made its indelible impress upon history and\r\nsecured for her a place among the immortals. Now, in life's evening, her\r\nworld is illumined with the beauty of a sunset undimmed by clouds--and\r\nas she contemplates the infinite, she takes no heed of the gathering\r\ndarkness of night, but looking into a clear sky beholds only the\r\nineffable glory of other spheres.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[132] Miss Laura Clay and Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch, the national\r\nauditors, were unable to be present.\r\n\r\n[133] There were present also reporters from the New York Sun, New York\r\nWorld, Springfield Republican, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, and\r\nother papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV--PAGE 229.\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO PRESIDENT LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n_Adopted by the Women's National Loyal League, May 14, 1863._\r\n\r\n... We ask not for ourselves or our friends redress of specific\r\ngrievances or posts of honor or emolument. We speak from no\r\nconsiderations of mere material gain; but, inspired by true patriotism,\r\nin this dark hour of our nation's destiny, we come to pledge the loyal\r\nwomen of the Republic to freedom and our country. We come to strengthen\r\nyou with earnest words of sympathy and encouragement. We come to thank\r\nyou for your proclamation, in which the nineteenth century seems to echo\r\nback the Declaration of Seventy-six. Our fathers had a vision of the\r\nsublime idea of liberty, equality and fraternity; but they failed to\r\nclimb the heights which with anointed eyes they saw. To us, their\r\nchildren, belongs the work to build up the living reality of what they\r\nconceived and uttered. It is not our mission to criticise the past.\r\nNations, like individuals, must blunder and repent. It is not wise to\r\nwaste our energy in vain regret, but from each failure we should rise up\r\nwith renewed conscience and courage for nobler action. The follies and\r\nfaults of yesterday we cast aside as the old garments we have outgrown.\r\nBorn anew to freedom, slave creeds and codes and constitutions all now\r\nmust pass away. \"For men do not put new wine into old bottles, else the\r\nbottles break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish; but they\r\nput new wine into new bottles and both are preserved.\"\r\n\r\nOur special thanks are due to you, that by your proclamation 2,000,000\r\nwomen are freed from the foulest bondage humanity ever suffered. Slavery\r\nfor man is bad enough, but the refinements of cruelty ever must fall on\r\nthe mothers of the oppressed race, defrauded of all the rights of the\r\nfamily relation and violated in the most holy instincts of their nature.\r\nA mother's life is bound up in that of her child. There center all her\r\nhopes and ambitions. But the slave-mother in her degradation rejoices\r\nnot in the future promise of her daughter, for she knows by experience\r\nwhat her sad fate must be. No pen can describe the unutterable agony of\r\nthat mother whose past, present and future all are wrapped in darkness;\r\nwho knows the crown of thorns she wears must press her daughter's brow;\r\nwho knows the wine-press she treads those tender feet must tread alone.\r\nFor, by the law of slavery, \"the child follows the condition of the\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\nBy your act, the family, that great conservator of national virtue and\r\nstrength, has been restored to millions of humble homes around whose\r\naltars coming generations shall magnify and bless the name of Abraham\r\nLincoln. By a mere stroke of the pen you have emancipated millions from\r\na condition of wholesale concubinage. We now ask you to finish the work\r\nby declaring that nowhere under our national flag shall the motherhood\r\nof any race plead in vain for justice and protection. So long as one\r\nslave breathes in this republic, we drag the chain with him. God has so\r\nlinked the race, man to man, that all must rise or fall together. Our\r\nhistory exemplifies this law. It was not enough that we at the North\r\nabolished slavery for ourselves, declared freedom of speech and press,\r\nbuilt churches, colleges and free schools, studied the science of\r\nmorals, government and economy, dignified labor, amassed wealth,\r\nwhitened the sea with our commerce and commanded the respect and\r\nadmiration of the nations of the earth--so long as the South, by the\r\nnatural proclivities of slavery, was sapping the very foundations of our\r\nnational life....\r\n\r\nYou are the first President ever borne on the shoulders of freedom into\r\nthe position you now fill. Your predecessors owed their elevation to the\r\nslave oligarchy, and in serving slavery they did but obey their masters.\r\nIn your election, northern freemen threw off the yoke, and with you\r\nrests the responsibility that our necks never shall bow again. At no\r\ntime in the annals of the nation has there been a more auspicious moment\r\nto retrieve the one false step of the fathers in their concessions to\r\nslavery. The Constitution has been repudiated and the compact broken by\r\nthe southern traitors now in arms. The firing of the first gun on Sumter\r\nreleased the North from all constitutional obligations to slavery. It\r\nleft the government, for the first time in our history, free to carry\r\nout the declaration of our Revolutionary fathers, and made us in fact\r\nwhat we ever have claimed to be, a nation of freemen.\r\n\r\n\"The Union as it was\"--a compromise between barbarism and\r\ncivilization--can never be restored, for the opposing principles of\r\nfreedom and slavery can not exist together. Liberty is life, and every\r\nform of government yet tried proves that slavery is death. In obedience\r\nto this law, our republic, divided and distracted by the collisions of\r\nclass and caste, is tottering to its base and can be reconstructed only\r\non the sure foundation of impartial freedom to all. The war in which we\r\nare involved is not the result of party or accident, but a forward step\r\nin the progress of the race never to be retraced. Revolution is no time\r\nfor temporizing or diplomacy. In a radical upheaving the people demand\r\neternal principles on which to stand.\r\n\r\nNorthern power and loyalty never can be measured until the purpose of\r\nthe war be liberty to man; for a lasting enthusiasm ever is based on a\r\ngrand idea, and unity of action demands a definite end. At this time our\r\ngreatest need is not men or money, valiant generals or brilliant\r\nvictories, but a _consistent policy_, based on the principle that \"all\r\ngovernments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.\"\r\nThe nation waits for you to say that there is no power under our\r\ndeclaration of rights nor under any laws, human or divine, by which free\r\nmen can be made slaves; and therefore that your pledge to the slaves is\r\nirrevocable, and shall be redeemed.\r\n\r\nIf it be true, as it is said, that northern women lack enthusiasm in\r\nthis war, the fault rests with those who have confused and confounded\r\nits policy. The pages of history glow with instances of self-sacrifice\r\nby women in the hour of their country's danger. Fear not that the\r\ndaughters of this republic will count any sacrifice too great to insure\r\nthe triumph of freedom. Let the men who wield the nation's power be\r\nwise, brave and magnanimous, and its women will be prompt to meet the\r\nduties of the hour with devotion and heroism.\r\n\r\nWhen Fremont on the western breeze proclaimed a day of jubilee to the\r\nbondmen within our gates, the women of the nation echoed back a loud\r\namen. When Hunter freed a million men and gave them arms to fight our\r\nbattles, justice and mercy crowned that act and tyrants stood appalled.\r\nWhen Butler, in the chief city of the southern despotism, hung a traitor\r\nwe felt a glow of pride; for that one act proved that we had a\r\ngovernment and one man brave enough to administer its laws. And when\r\nBurnside would banish Vallandigham to the Dry Tortugas, let the sentence\r\nbe approved and the nation will ring with plaudits. Your proclamation\r\ngives you immortality. Be just, and share your glory with men like these\r\nwho wait to execute your will.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the Women's National Loyal League,\r\n\r\n                         ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, _President_.\r\n                         SUSAN B. ANTHONY, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV--PAGE 247.\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n_Address Delivered at Ottumwa, Kansas, July 4, 1865._\r\n\r\n_Mr. President, and Men and Women of Kansas:_\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to me, beyond the reach of words, to be with you today.\r\nI accepted the invitation of your committee that I might feast my eyes\r\non your grand prairies, ever fringed with the darker green of their\r\ntimber-skirted creeks and rivers. I came here on this 89th anniversary\r\nof our National Independence, that I might look into the honest, earnest\r\nfaces of the men and the women who, ten years ago, taught the nation\r\nanew, that \"resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.\" Through all this\r\nglorious decade of heroic struggle, my interests, my sympathies, my\r\naffections have been bound up with yours; for, during and since the\r\ncruel outrages of the summer of 1856, my two and only brothers have\r\nstood shoulder to shoulder with the freedom-loving, freedom-voting,\r\nfreedom-fighting men of Kansas. And, as I have waited the telegraphic\r\nword that trembled along the western wires, telling of your successes\r\nand your defeats, it has ever been with bated breath lest those of my\r\nown home circle, too, should be numbered among the slain. Therefore,\r\nthough not here in person through all these trial years, in spirit I\r\nhave been with you, in your privations and hardships, in your sufferings\r\nand sacrifices to make freedom and free institutions the sure\r\ninheritance of Kansas and the nation.\r\n\r\nYou have already listened to the grand old Declaration of the Fathers of\r\n1776. You have heard the true words of your representative to the next\r\nCongress.[134] His manly utterances here today give you assurance that\r\nhe will faithfully reflect the highest and truest sentiments of his\r\nconstituency. Men and women of Kansas, I congratulate you, that you have\r\nin this chosen agent a man who will speak and vote on the vital\r\nquestions to come before the next Congress from the standpoint of human\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose to call your attention to the recent declarations of\r\nour President to our \"erring sister States\" of the South. I ask you\r\nspecially to note his proclamation to Mississippi. After pointing out\r\nthat the Constitution of the United States guarantees to every State in\r\nthe Union a republican form of government, and that the late rebellion\r\nhas deprived the people of Mississippi of all civil government, he\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n     Now, therefore, in obedience to the high and solemn duties imposed\r\n     upon me by the Constitution of the United States, and for the\r\n     purpose of enabling the loyal people of said State to organize a\r\n     State government, whereby justice may be established, domestic\r\n     tranquillity insured, and loyal citizens protected in all their\r\n     rights of life, liberty, and property, I, Andrew Johnson, President\r\n     of the United States, and Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy\r\n     of the United States, do hereby appoint William L. Sharkey\r\n     Provisional Governor of the State of Mississippi, whose duty it\r\n     shall be, at the earliest practicable period, to prescribe such\r\n     rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for convening\r\n     a convention, composed of delegates to be chosen by that portion of\r\n     the people of said State who are loyal to the United States, and no\r\n     others, for the purpose of altering or amending the constitution\r\n     thereof; and with authority to exercise, within the limits of said\r\n     State, all the powers necessary and proper to enable such loyal\r\n     people of the State of Mississippi to restore said State to its\r\n     constitutional relations to the Federal government, and to present\r\n     such republican form of State government as will entitle the State\r\n     to the guarantee of the United States therefor, and its people to\r\n     protection by the United States against invasion, insurrection, and\r\n     domestic violence: Provided, That in any election that may be\r\n     hereafter held for choosing delegates to any State Convention as\r\n     aforesaid, no person shall be qualified as an elector, or shall be\r\n     eligible as a member of such convention, unless he shall have\r\n     previously taken and subscribed the oath of amnesty, as set forth\r\n     in the President's proclamation of May 29, A. D. 1865, _and is a\r\n     voter qualified as prescribed by the Constitution and laws of the\r\n     State, of Mississippi, in force immediately before the ninth (9th)\r\n     of January, A. D. 1861, the date of the so-called ordinance of\r\n     secession_; and the said convention, when convened, or the\r\n     Legislature that may be thereafter assembled, will prescribe the\r\n     qualifications of electors, and the eligibility of persons to hold\r\n     office under the Constitution and laws of the State, a power the\r\n     people of the several States composing the Federal Union have\r\n     rightfully exercised from the origin of the government to the\r\n     present time.\r\n\r\nThe President says he finds the people of Mississippi \"deprived of all\r\ncivil government\" by the revolutionary progress of the rebellion;\r\ntherefore he appoints a provisional governor, to call an election of the\r\nloyal people for delegates to a convention to alter or amend the\r\nconstitution that was in force prior to the rebellion. He does this \"for\r\nthe purpose of enabling the loyal people of said State to organize a\r\nState government whereby justice may be established, domestic\r\ntranquillity insured, and loyal citizens protected in all their rights\r\nof life, liberty and property.\" To this laudable end he instructs the\r\ngovernor, who is his military agent, to allow no man to vote or to be\r\nvoted for, unless he shall have previously taken and subscribed to the\r\noath of amnesty of May 29, 1865, _and is a voter by the old constitution\r\nand laws of the slaveholding State of Mississippi_. By this ordering,\r\nthe President makes it impossible for the great mass of the loyal people\r\nto have a voice in organizing the new government. He re-establishes\r\nprecisely the same basis of class representation that worked out the\r\nruin of the old State government. Not to mention the loyal women, who\r\nmake fully one-half of the loyal people, he shuts out all the loyal\r\nblack men, with all the loyal poor white men, who were not allowed to\r\nvote under the old regime of slavery.\r\n\r\nThus, by this initiative step, the President makes it inevitable that\r\nthe rebuilding of the government shall be controlled by the ex-rebels;\r\nthe men who have fought desperately for four years to overthrow the\r\nfederal government; the men who hate republicanism; the men who love and\r\nare determined to enjoy aristocracy. The loyal white men there, who have\r\nstood firmly and truly by the government through all the cruel\r\npersecutions of this bloody rebellion, are today a most powerless and\r\npitiable minority; and yet the President tells this little handful that\r\ntheir only hope of organizing a genuine republican form of government\r\nlies in their ability to outvote the vast horde of disloyal civilians\r\nand pardoned, but not penitent, returned rebel soldiers. Such an\r\noffence against white loyalty is enough to make the very stones cry out.\r\n\r\nBut what shall we say of the other and deeper crime against the\r\nthousands of loyal black soldiers, who have fought bravely for us from\r\nthe hour we permitted them to shoulder the musket; against the entire\r\nslave population, who have welcomed our Yankee soldiers, been faithful\r\nspies and guides to our armies, nursed our sick and wounded, relieved\r\nand rescued our starving prisoners, and in every conceivable way and\r\nmanner given \"aid and comfort\" to our Union cause? I tell you, men and\r\nwomen of Kansas, no tongue can speak the ingratitude, the injustice, the\r\nshame and outrage of a proposition thus to leave those true and faithful\r\nfreedmen to the cruel legislation of their old tyrants and oppressors,\r\nmade tenfold more their enemies, because of their attachment and service\r\nto the government which they themselves have failed to destroy. Think of\r\nit, to thrust four million loyal people under the political heel of\r\neight millions, almost to a man, disloyal!\r\n\r\nI am sure you, who have given the best blood of Kansas to put down the\r\nslaveholders' rebellion against the rightful rule of the majority, will\r\nnever by your silence give seeming consent to a reorganization of those\r\nrebel States on any basis save that of the ballot to all loyal citizens,\r\nblack and white. You will never consent that loyal Union soldiers and\r\nfriends, for no crime but the color of their skin, shall be made\r\nsubjects, if not slaves, to disloyal rebel soldiers and enemies, with no\r\nvirtue but that of belonging to the \"governing race,\" as the President's\r\nNorth Carolina appointee calls the white faces. No, no, you will make\r\nthese grand old prairies ring with your thunder-toned protests until\r\nthey shall be felt and feared in the legislative halls at Washington.\r\nThen will your honorable and honored representative say for you on the\r\nfloor of the next Congress, as he has said here today in the shadow of\r\nthese mighty oaks of your Neosho, \"no reconstruction except on the basis\r\nof the ballot in every loyal hand, black and white.\" Then will your\r\nsenator[135] echo your voice from his seat in the Capitol, as he did the\r\nother day in old, Faneuil Hall, when he said, \"the price of our\r\nvictories is lost unless we give the negro the homestead, the musket,\r\nand the ballot.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then will your other senator,[136] who has not spoken since he, with\r\nhis colleagues in the Senate, said, \"colonize\" the faithful, loyal\r\nblacks; since he said, admit Louisiana and Arkansas back into the Union\r\non the vote of the merest minority of their freshly-oathed white\r\nmen--then will he say \"no reconstruction without negro suffrage.\" But,\r\ngood people, I charge you, suffer not this man to return to his seat in\r\nthe Senate, until he has not only repented and confessed, but given sure\r\npromise forever to forsake his old sins of \"white suffrage\" and \"black\r\ncolonization.\" You owe it to yourselves and your country to see that\r\nyour entire representation in the next Congress is right on this one\r\nvital question of reunion. Tell your senator if he must advocate a class\r\nand caste government in the rebel States, it must be loyal blacks, not\r\ndisloyal whites. If he must colonize somebody, it must be the cowed,\r\nunconverted rebels, the anti-negro-equality white faces. Tell him\r\nhenceforth to speak and vote to disfranchise, and drive out if need be,\r\nthe persons who make war and oppress and outrage, and are resolved not\r\nto give \"fair play\" to peaceable, industrious citizens. You have but to\r\nspeak and you will be obeyed, for it is the people's will, not that of\r\ntheir servants, which is law.\r\n\r\nNow, a word on your State legislature: One of the first reports that met\r\nmy ear on my arrival in your State last winter, was that the Republicans\r\nof Kansas, almost in a body, had voted against a bill for \"negro\r\nsuffrage,\" and that they voted thus for the reason that the question was\r\nintroduced and urged by the opposition party of the State. My humble but\r\nearnest advice to you is that you permit those delegates who voted\r\nagainst right, against justice, against equality to all men, for so\r\npaltry a reason, henceforth to remain quietly at home. Teach them and\r\nall other aspirants for your suffrages that your representatives must\r\nspeak and vote for the right, though the arch-demon from the pit below\r\nshall present the measure. That miserable political quibbling at Topeka\r\nlast winter lost Kansas the place which of right belonged to her--that\r\nof being the first of the loyal States to give her freedmen their\r\ninalienable right to self-protection.\r\n\r\nOur hope of salvation from the fatal errors that are now fastening\r\nthemselves upon the plan and the policy of reorganization, lies in the\r\nprompt and right action of the coming Congress. The delegates from any\r\nand all of the rebel States, sent up to Washington by \"free white loyal\r\nmale\" suffrages to knock for admission into the Union, must be sent home\r\nwith instructions that no member will be admitted to Congress except he\r\nbe elected by a majority of all the loyal men of the State, black as\r\nwell as white. To the end that Congress may thus reject the amnestied\r\nwhite suffrage delegates, the people, all over the country, should unite\r\nin one mighty voice and demand that their representatives shall thus\r\nspeak and thus vote. \"The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.\" If we\r\nsleep now, all is lost; for on this one question of the negro hangs the\r\nfuture of our republic.\r\n\r\nSince the firing of the first gun of the rebellion there has been no\r\nhour fraught with so much danger as is the present. To have been\r\nvanquished on the field of battle would have involved much of misery;\r\nbut to be foiled now in gathering up the fruits of our blood-bought\r\nvictories, and to re-enthrone slavery under the new guise of negro\r\ndisfranchisement, negro serfdom, would be a defeat and disaster, a\r\ncruelty and crime, which would surely bequeath to coming generations a\r\nlegacy of wars and rumors of wars, equalled only by that which the\r\nRevolutionary fathers entailed upon their descendants by their fatal\r\ncompromises with slavery. It would leave the final triumph of the great\r\nprinciples of republicanism, universal freedom and equality, \"taxation\r\nand representation inseparable,\" the \"consent of the governed,\" to be\r\nworked out and established in each of those old slave States, through a\r\nfearful re-enactment of the early struggles which you of Kansas so well\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nIf Congress shall admit the rebel representatives on the basis of white\r\nsuffrage, those States will have added to their old representation the\r\nother two-fifths of what used to be \"all other persons,\" which will give\r\nthem an increase of fourteen votes in the House as a reward for their\r\nfour years of fire and sword against the government. With this added\r\npower on the floor of Congress united to their political aiders and\r\nabettors from the Northern States, there is scarcely any project they\r\nmay not be able to carry through in their own time and way. Nor is there\r\nroom for a doubt, that it is the spirit and purpose of the slave\r\noligarchy, whipped and cowed as they say by force of might, not right,\r\nto make a most desperate political fight to regain their old supremacy\r\nin the legislation of the country.\r\n\r\nI base my estimate of the nature and intentions of the to-be-restored\r\nrepresentation of the South, on the results of the elections already\r\nheld in several of the rebel States, and from the efforts everywhere\r\namong the old planters again to reduce the black freedmen, as nearly as\r\npossible, to the status of slavery. In Virginia, the elections gave a\r\nlegislature largely secession and almost wholly anti-negro. The planters\r\nhave solemnly leagued themselves together to pay only five dollars per\r\nmonth to able field hands, each laborer to furnish his own clothes and\r\npay his own doctor bills. This, too, when these same planters used to\r\npay or receive for the hire of these same laborers, the sum of fifteen\r\ndollars and upwards. In South Carolina, Gen. Rufus Saxton reports that\r\nthe old planters are actually driving the freedmen to work in the fields\r\nin chain gangs, and that the woods are strewn with the bodies of negroes\r\nshot dead in their efforts to escape the cruel torture. In Murfreesboro,\r\nTennessee, the city election resulted in a secession mayor and common\r\ncouncil. The only Union success I have noticed is that of Fernandina,\r\nFlorida, and there the negroes were allowed to vote. Even the loyal\r\nState of Missouri saved her free constitution by less than two thousand\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nThe result of white suffrage can not be other than the election of large\r\nmajorities of anti-negro, if not absolutely secession State and National\r\nrepresentatives. Tennessee, the President's own State, of the loyalty of\r\nwhose people we have heard much, has adopted a free constitution, and\r\nunder it framed a new code of anti-negro laws; and we can hardly expect\r\nany rebel State to do better, for these new free State law-makers are\r\nthe persecuted loyal men of Tennessee who have been outraged in their\r\nhomes, hunted to the caves and mountains, or for a time driven out of\r\nthe State altogether by the secessionists. One of these new free State\r\nlaws says, the testimony of no \"free colored person shall be received in\r\ncourt against any white person.\" By this enactment, the meanest white\r\nman may enter the home of the bravest black soldier, or wealthiest\r\ncolored citizen, may murder his sons, ravish his wife and daughters,\r\npillage and burn his house, commit any and every possible crime against\r\nhim and his, and yet, if no human eye but his own, or that of his\r\nfamily, or his colored friends, witness the barbarisms, that black man,\r\nthe father, the husband, the land-holder, outraged beyond measure, has\r\nno possible legal redress in the courts of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThen again, in case a free colored person is imprisoned and unable to\r\npay his jail fees, he may be apprenticed out to labor until the sum be\r\npaid. And yet again, the courts may apprentice colored children as they\r\nsee proper. The law does not even say friendless or orphan children. Is\r\nnot that slavery under a new form? Thus, to leave those devoted black\r\nmen's lives, liberties and property to be protected by white men, whose\r\nloyalty to the government is because it is a means to secure power to\r\nthemselves, not from any love of its republican principles, is to doom\r\nthem to all the ignominies and cruelties of slavery itself.\r\n\r\nLet us not be deceived by the wicked wiles of politicians who tell us\r\nthat President Johnson can not give the right to the ballot to the black\r\nloyalists of the South; for it is but the new \"refuge of lies\" to which\r\nslavery resorts. The same men told us that Lincoln had not the power to\r\nemancipate the slaves; that the government had no right to arm the\r\nnegro, etc. If President Johnson has constitutional authority, either\r\ncivil or military, to take away a man's right to vote, as a punishment\r\nfor disloyalty, he must have power to give a man the same right, as a\r\nreward for loyalty; if the President may disfranchise a rebel soldier in\r\norder to enable the loyal people of a State to organize a republican\r\nform of government, he may also enfranchise a Union soldier to\r\naccomplish the same purpose. If the President has not the right nor the\r\npower to give the ballot to any person not entitled to it under the old\r\norder of slavery, how will he organize South Carolina, by whose old\r\nconstitution no person was allowed to vote unless he owned ten slaves or\r\nwas worth ten thousand dollars? Of course nobody owns ten slaves, and\r\nhow many men, think you, who remained loyal at home, or how many\r\nreturned soldiers or amnestied civilians have the requisite ten thousand\r\ndollars? In South Carolina, therefore, the President will be compelled\r\nto create voters; and, if he shall enfranchise any of the white\r\nnon-voters, can he not also enfranchise the loyal black non-voters?\r\n\r\nLet us watch and pray without ceasing. Let us hope that the day will\r\ndawn, and that soon, when law shall be found on the side of justice to\r\nthe black race. These objectors never questioned McClellan's military\r\nright to put down slave insurrections with an \"iron hand,\" or Halleck's\r\ninfamous Order No. 3 to drive all negroes outside the military lines. It\r\nwas only when Generals Fremont, Hunter and others declared the slaves\r\nfree, that they might cripple the rebel armies and add them to our Union\r\nforces, that the cry of no law, no power was raised. Thus it is clear\r\nthat the blindness and inability to find rightful authority, civil or\r\nmilitary, first to emancipate, then to arm, and now to enfranchise the\r\nnegroes, have the one source. Slavery perpetrated the \"sum of all\r\nvillainies\" on the negroes, and then, to justify its wickedness, filled\r\nthe whole land with atrocious lies of their depraved and degraded\r\nnature. The American people consented to the outrage; and their\r\ncontinued prejudice against that oppressed race but proves the adage,\r\n\"we hate those whom we have injured.\"\r\n\r\nLast of all comes the objection that the old masters will influence the\r\nvote of the negroes, and that, therefore, to enfranchise them will but\r\ngive increased power to the old lords of the lash. Do not believe such\r\nnonsense. Think you, men who for four years have withstood every\r\npossible temptation and torture to induce them to fight for the slave\r\noligarchy, can now be wheedled into voting for it? No, no. Those loyal,\r\nbrave, black men who have known enough to fight on the right side will\r\nknow enough to vote on the right side; and it is because the aiders and\r\nabettors of the old slave power believe and know that the negroes will\r\nbe an invincible host on the side of equality, that they thus fear them.\r\n\r\nWe never from the beginning have had a genuine republican form of\r\ngovernment in any State in the Union; for in no State have \"the people\"\r\never been permitted to elect their representatives. Even in\r\nMassachusetts and Vermont, the States nearest republican, only one-half\r\nof the people, the \"male inhabitants,\" are allowed to vote. In other\r\nStates it is only all \"free white male persons,\" and in others still,\r\nall \"free white male inhabitants owning so many slaves or so much\r\nproperty.\" It is not true therefore that _the people_ have ever\r\nexercised the right to prescribe the qualifications of voters or\r\nofficers. From the beginning, Congress always has settled the question\r\nin its organic act. That of your own Territory read, \"Every free, white,\r\nmale inhabitant shall vote at the first election, and be eligible to any\r\noffice within the Territory.\" Thus you see Congress, not you, the\r\npeople, decided who should and who should not vote in Kansas. And when\r\nthe delegates of the prescribed \"free, white, male\" order met in\r\nconvention, they proved themselves nothing above human, very like the\r\nso-elected conventions of other States, and retained all legislative\r\npower within the limits of the original congressional permit. The same\r\nis true of the rebel States, in which the President now finds the people\r\ndestitute of all civil government; when he specifies who may vote, when\r\nhe excludes any class from the ballot-box, he makes it impossible for\r\n\"the people\" to form a republican government.\r\n\r\nWhen the loyal black men are not allowed their right to vote in the\r\nfirst election of the rebel States, their governments are thrown into\r\nthe hands of a very small minority, and that too of very doubtful\r\nloyalty. The President by adhering to the old slave definition of \"the\r\npeople,\" rules that all our brave black Union soldiers and our best\r\nfriends and allies, without whose aid we should still be struggling with\r\nrebels in arms, shall be subjects, not citizens, of the government they\r\nhave rescued from the Confederate usurpers. It is not in human nature\r\nthat a people fanatically believing themselves a superior race, and\r\nthereby rightful legislators over another and inferior race, shall\r\nexecute justice and equality toward those whom they decree shall be\r\n\"hewers of wood and drawers of water.\" No, the black man's guarantee to\r\nthe protection of his inalienable rights to \"life, liberty and\r\nproperty,\" is bound up in his right to the ballot.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak of the inalienable rights of the negro, I do not forget\r\nthat these belong equally to woman. Though the government shall be\r\nreconstructed on the basis of universal manhood suffrage, it yet will\r\nnot be a true republic. Still one-half of the people will be in\r\nsubjection to the other half, and the time will surely come when the\r\nwhole question will have to be reopened and an accounting made with this\r\nother subject class. There will have to be virtually another\r\nreconstruction, based on the duty of the national government to\r\nguarantee to every citizen the right of self-protection, and this right,\r\nfor woman as for man, is vested in the ballot.\r\n\r\nThat this superior \"white male\" class may not be trusted even to\r\nlegislate for their own mothers, sisters, wives and daughters, the cruel\r\nstatutes in nearly all the States, both slave and free, give ample\r\nproof. In scarcely a State has a married woman the legal right to the\r\ncontrol of her person, to the earnings of her hands or brain, to the\r\nguardianship of her children, to sue or be sued, or to testify in the\r\ncourts, and by these laws women have suffered wrongs and outrages second\r\nonly to those of chattel slavery itself. If this be true, that this\r\nso-called superior class can not legislate justice even to those nearest\r\nand dearest in their own hearts and homes, is it not a crime to place a\r\nseparate race, one hated and despised, wholly at the will of that\r\ngoverning class?\r\n\r\nIt must not be; and the one great work for the people at this hour, and\r\nevery hour, between this and next December, is to agitate this question\r\nuntil the entire nation shall speak in tones not to be mistaken, which\r\nshall compel the coming Congress to refuse admission to every\r\nrepresentative from the rebel States, who is sent there by the so-called\r\n\"loyal white male\" people.\r\n\r\n\"_No reorganization without Negro Suffrage_\" is the word to send back to\r\nevery rebel State. Until Congress shall define and settle this question,\r\nit can not in the future, as it has not in the past, perform its\r\nduty--guarantee a republican form of government in each of the States.\r\nWhen Congress shall thus decide, there will be work to do in most of the\r\nloyal States. Let us all labor to that end.\r\n\r\nMen and women of Kansas, what say you, shall new loyal States or old\r\nrebel States be admitted into the Union until they present constitutions\r\nand laws truly republican, until they send representatives to Washington\r\nelected by a majority of all the people--white and black, men and women?\r\nYou say No; your blood-enriched prairies, your battle-fought ravines,\r\nyour sacked and burned cities, say No; your martyred dead, your own\r\nimmortal John Brown, their freed souls all gloriously marching on, say\r\nNo!\r\n\r\nMy friends, there is one word more I must leave with you. There is yet\r\nanother danger. The reverence, the almost idolatry of the American\r\npeople for their martyred President, is being used and abused by the\r\npolitical managers at Washington, and over all the country. The people\r\nare lulled to sleep over the most startling propositions, by insidious\r\nwhisperings that President Lincoln originated or approved them. Almost\r\nevery reconstruction plan is sent over the wires \"sugar-coated\" with,\r\n\"President Johnson, in this, is but carrying out the spirit and purpose\r\nof Mr. Lincoln!\" And there is no disguising or denying the fact, that\r\nthe people are today accepting, and that too without questioning, the\r\nanti-negro reorganization plans already inaugurated, because of these\r\nwily, insinuating appeals to their reverence for the memory of their\r\nsacred dead.\r\n\r\nIf the four years' administration of Abraham Lincoln taught the American\r\npeople any one lesson above another, it was that they must think and\r\nspeak and proclaim, and that he, as President, was bound to execute\r\ntheir will, not his own. And if Lincoln were alive today, he would say\r\nas he did four years ago, \"I wait the voice of the people.\" The stern\r\nlogic of the events of today would guide him, not those of yesterday.\r\nTherefore let us not be thrown off our watch by any of these appeals to\r\nour reverence for the opinions and plans of our departed President. If\r\nhis freed spirit is permitted today to hover over each and all of the\r\nvast gatherings of the loyal people throughout the nation, it is\r\nbeckoning every soul upward and onward in the path of equal justice to\r\nall; it is urging the great heart of the nation to plant our new Union\r\non the everlasting rock of republicanism--universal freedom and\r\nuniversal suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[134] Sidney Clark, of Lawrence.\r\n\r\n[135] S.

Anthony.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives:_\r\n\r\nWe already have presented to your honorable body during this session\r\nmany petitions asking the enfranchisement of women; and now, from our\r\nnational convention, we again make our appeal and urge you to lay no\r\nhand on that \"pyramid of rights,\" the Constitution of the Fathers,\r\nunless to add glory to its height and strength to its foundation.\r\n\r\nWe will not rehearse the oft-repeated arguments on the natural rights of\r\nevery citizen, pressed as they have been on the nation's conscience for\r\nthe last thirty years in securing freedom for the black race, and so\r\ngrandly echoed on the floor of Congress during the past winter. We can\r\nnot add one line or precept to the comprehensive speech recently made by\r\nCharles Sumner in the Senate, to prove that \"no just government can be\r\nformed without the consent of the governed;\" to prove the dignity, the\r\neducation, the power, the necessity, the salvation of the ballot in the\r\nhand of every man and woman; to prove that a just government and a true\r\nchurch rest alike on the sacred rights of the individual.\r\n\r\nAs you are familiar with Sumner's speech on \"Equal Rights to All,\" so\r\nconvincing in facts, so clear in philosophy, and so elaborate in\r\nquotations from the great minds of the past, without reproducing the\r\nchain of argument, permit us to call your attention to a few of its\r\nunanswerable assertions regarding the ballot:\r\n\r\n     I plead now for the ballot, as the great guarantee, and the only\r\n     sufficient guarantee--being in itself peacemaker, reconciler,\r\n     schoolmaster and protector--to which we are bound by every\r\n     necessity and every reason; and I speak also for the good of the\r\n     States lately in rebellion, as well as for the glory and safety of\r\n     the republic, that it may be an example to mankind.\r\n\r\n     Ay, sir, the ballot is the Columbiad of our political life, and\r\n     every citizen who has it is a full-armed Monitor.\r\n\r\n     The ballot is schoolmaster. Reading and writing are of inestimable\r\n     value, but the ballot teaches what these can not teach.\r\n\r\n     Plutarch records that the wise man of Athens charmed the people by\r\n     saying that equality causes no war, and \"both the rich and the poor\r\n     repeated it.\"\r\n\r\n     The ballot is like charity, which never faileth, and without which\r\n     man is only as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. The ballot is\r\n     the one thing needful, without which rights of testimony and all\r\n     other rights will be no better than cobwebs which the master will\r\n     break through with impunity. To him who has the ballot all other\r\n     things shall be given--protection, opportunity, education, a\r\n     homestead. The ballot is like the horn of abundance, out of which\r\n     overflow rights of every kind, with corn, cotton, rice and all the\r\n     fruits of the earth. Or, better still, it is like the hand of the\r\n     body, without which man, who is now only a little lower than the\r\n     angels, must have continued only a little above the brutes. They\r\n     are fearfully and wonderfully made; but as is the hand in the work\r\n     of civilization, so is the ballot in the work of government. \"Give\r\n     me the ballot, and I can move the world.\"\r\n\r\n     Do you wish to see harmony truly prevail, so that industry,\r\n     society, government, civilization, may all prosper, and the\r\n     republic may wear a crown of true greatness? Then do not neglect\r\n     the ballot.\r\n\r\n     Lamartine said, \"Universal suffrage is the first truth and only\r\n     basis of every national republic.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to \"taxation without representation,\" Mr. Sumner quotes from\r\nLord Coke:\r\n\r\n     The supreme power can not take from any man any part of his\r\n     property without consent in person or by representation.\r\n\r\n     Taxes are not to be laid on the people, but by their consent in\r\n     person or by representation.\r\n\r\n     I can see no reason to doubt but that the imposition of taxes,\r\n     whether on trade, or on land or houses or ships, or real or\r\n     personal, fixed or floating property in the colonies, is absolutely\r\n     irreconcilable with the rights of the colonies, as British subjects\r\n     and as men. I say men, for in a state of nature no man can take any\r\n     property from me without my consent. If he does, he deprives me of\r\n     my liberty and makes me a slave. The very act of taxing, exercised\r\n     over those who are not represented, appears to me to deprive them\r\n     of one of their most essential rights as freemen, and if continued\r\n     seems to be in effect an entire disfranchisement of every civil\r\n     right. For what one civil right is worth a rush, after a man's\r\n     property is subject to be taken from him at pleasure without his\r\n     consent?\r\n\r\nIn demanding suffrage for the black man you recognize the fact that, as\r\na freedman, he is no longer a \"part of the family,\" and that therefore\r\nhis master is no longer his representative; hence, as he will now be\r\nliable to taxation, he must also have representation. Woman, on the\r\ncontrary, has never been such a \"part of the family\" as to escape\r\ntaxation. Although there has been no formal proclamation giving her an\r\nindividual existence, the single woman always has had the right to\r\nproperty and wages, the right to make contracts and do business in her\r\nown name. And even married women, by recent legislation, have been\r\nsecured in these civil rights. Woman now holds a vast amount of the\r\nproperty in the country and pays her full proportion of taxes, revenue\r\nincluded. On what principle, then, do you deny her representation? By\r\nwhat process of reasoning was Charles Sumner able to stand up in the\r\nSenate, a few days after these sublime utterances, and rebuke 15,000,000\r\ndisfranchised tax-payers for the exercise of their mere right of\r\npetition? If he felt that this was not the time for woman even to\r\nmention her right to representation, why did he not, in some of his\r\nsplendid sentences, propose to release the wage-earning and\r\nproperty-owning women from the tyranny of taxation?\r\n\r\nWe propose no new theories. We simply ask that you secure the practical\r\napplication of the immutable principles of our government to all,\r\nwithout distinction of race, color or sex. And we urge our demand now,\r\nbecause you have now the opportunity and the power to take this onward\r\nstep in legislation. The nations of the earth stand watching and waiting\r\nto see if our Revolutionary idea, \"all men are created equal,\" can be\r\nrealized in government. Crush not, we pray you, the myriad hopes which\r\nhang on our success. Peril not this nation with another bloody war. Men\r\nand parties must pass away, but justice is eternal; and only they who\r\nwork in harmony with its laws are immortal. All who have carefully\r\ncontrasted the speeches of this Congress with those made under the old\r\nregime of slavery, must have seen the added power and eloquence which\r\ngreater freedom gives. But still you propose no action on your grand\r\nideas. Your joint resolutions, your reconstruction reports, do not\r\nreflect your highest thought.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, as it stands, in basing representation on \"respective\r\nnumbers\" covers a broader ground than any you have yet proposed. Is not\r\nthe only amendment needed to Article 1, Section 3, to strike out the\r\nexceptions which follow \"respective numbers?\" And is it not your duty,\r\nby securing a republican form of government to every State, to see that\r\nthese \"respective numbers\" are made up of enfranchised citizens, thus\r\nbringing your legislation up to the Constitution--not the Constitution\r\ndown to your party possibilities? The only tenable ground of\r\nrepresentation is universal suffrage, as it is only through universal\r\nsuffrage that the principle of \"equal rights to all\" can be realized.\r\nAll prohibitions based on race, color, sex, property or education are\r\nviolations of the republican idea; and the various qualifications now\r\nproposed are but so many plausible pretexts to debar new classes from\r\nthe ballot-box. The limitations of property and intelligence, though\r\nunfair, can be met; as with freedom must come the repeal of statute laws\r\nthat deny schools and wages to the negro, and time will make him a\r\nvoter. But color and sex! Neither time nor statutes can make black,\r\nwhite, or woman, man! You assume to be the representatives of 15,000,000\r\nwomen--American citizens--who already possess every attainable\r\nqualification for the ballot. Women read and write, hold many offices\r\nunder government, pay taxes and suffer the penalties of crime, and yet\r\nare denied individual representation.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years we have labored to bring the statute-laws of the\r\nseveral States into harmony with the broad principles of the\r\nConstitution, and have been so far successful that in many of them\r\nlittle remains to be done except to secure the right of suffrage. Hence,\r\nour prompt protest against the propositions before Congress to introduce\r\nthe word \"male\" into the Federal Constitution, which, if successful,\r\nwould sanction all State action in withholding the ballot from woman. As\r\nthe only way in which disfranchised citizens can appear before you, we\r\navailed ourselves of the sacred right of petition; and, as our\r\nrepresentatives, it was your duty to give those petitions a respectful\r\nreading and a serious consideration. How a Republican Senate failed in\r\nthat duty, is already inscribed on the page of history. Some tell us it\r\nis not judicious to press the claims of women now; that this is not the\r\ntime. Time? When you propose legislation so fatal to the best interests\r\nof woman and the nation, shall we be silent until after the deed is\r\ndone? No! As we love justice, we must resist tyranny. As we honor the\r\nposition of American senator, we must appeal from the politician to the\r\nman.\r\n\r\nWith man, woman shared the dangers of the Mayflower on a stormy sea, the\r\ndreary landing on Plymouth Rock, the rigors of New England winters and\r\nthe privations of a seven years' war. With him she bravely threw off the\r\nBritish yoke, felt every pulsation of his heart for freedom, and\r\ninspired the glowing eloquence which maintained it through the century.\r\nWith you, we have just passed through the agony and death, the\r\nresurrection and triumph of another revolution, doing all in our power\r\nto mitigate its horrors and gild its glories. And now, think you, we\r\nhave no souls to fire, no brains to weigh your arguments; that, after\r\neducation such as this, we can stand silent witnesses while you sell our\r\nbirthright of liberty to save from a timely death an effete political\r\norganization? No, as we respect womanhood, we must protest against this\r\ndesecration of the magna charta of American liberties; and with an\r\nimportunity not to be repelled, our demand must ever be, \"No compromise\r\nof human rights\"--\"No admission to the Constitution of inequality of\r\nrights or disfranchisement on account of color or sex.\"\r\n\r\nIn the oft-repeated experiments of class and caste, who can number the\r\nnations that have risen but to fall? Do not imagine you come one line\r\nnearer the demand of justice by enfranchising but another shade of\r\nmanhood; for, in denying representation to woman, you still cling to the\r\nsame false principle on which all the governments of the past have been\r\nwrecked. The right way, the safe way, is so clear, the path of duty is\r\nso straight and simple, that we who are equally interested with\r\nyourselves in the result, conjure you to act not for the passing hour,\r\nnot with reference to transient benefits, but to do now the one grand\r\ndeed which shall mark the zenith of the century--proclaim Equal Eights\r\nto All. We press our demand for the ballot at this time in no narrow,\r\ncaptions or selfish spirit; from no contempt of the black man's claims,\r\nnor antagonism to you who, in the progress of civilization, are now the\r\nprivileged order; but from the purest patriotism, for the highest good\r\nof every citizen, for the safety of the republic, and as a glorious\r\nexample to the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX--PAGE 342.\r\n\r\nMISS ANTHONY'S FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY.\r\n\r\n_February 15, 1870._\r\n\r\nCareful readers of the Tribune have probably succeeded in discovering\r\nthat we have not always been able to applaud the course of Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony. Indeed, we have often felt, and sometimes said, that her\r\nmethods were as unwise as we thought her aims undesirable. But through\r\nthese years of disputation and struggling, she has thoroughly impressed\r\nfriends and enemies alike with the sincerity and earnestness of her\r\npurposes....\r\n\r\nFifty years ago the full moon of suffrage rose in the small, red and\r\nwrinkled countenance of the infant Susan B. Anthony. \"Agitation is the\r\nword,\" says Miss Anthony, in these her later years. Agitation was\r\nprobably the word then, as a happy family surrounded the cradle of the\r\nboisterous phenomenon. Miss Anthony has compressed into her half-century\r\na deal of work, talk, hurry and resolution. Beginning with the women's\r\ntemperance conventions in 1848, she has strewn the gliding years with\r\norganizations, societies, conventions innumerable, to the wonderment, if\r\nnot always to the admiration, of an observant world. \"Through all these\r\nyears,\" remarks Mrs. Henry B. Stanton, \"Miss Anthony was the connecting\r\nlink between me and the outer world--the reform scout who went to see\r\nwhat was going on in the enemy's camp, and returned with maps and\r\nobservations to plan the mode of attack.\" It has been intimated that\r\nMiss Anthony has not remained sweet Dian's votary, in maiden meditation\r\nfancy free, because nobody asked her to change her name and station.\r\nMany victims, we are told, are carrying crushed hearts and blighted\r\nhopes through life, and all because of the unrelenting cruelty exercised\r\nby this usually good-humored woman towards the whole male sex.--The\r\nTribune.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony bears her fifty summers lightly. Whatever our sentiments\r\nmay be as to the cause she advocates, we do full justice to her\r\nresistless energy and activity and unswerving fidelity to her\r\nprinciples. Charming and cordial in her manners, with kind words for\r\nall, she welcomed every guest last evening and made them at ease.--The\r\nTimes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was regarded last night, and was a topic of conversation, that the\r\npublic announcement that Miss Anthony was fifty years old was one more\r\nof the courageous things for which her life has been distinguished.\r\nBattling with the wrong and striving for the right has not left so rigid\r\na mark of the progress of time upon her features as to prevent her\r\nkeeping up a little fiction about being fair and forty. Miss Anthony\r\nprefers the truth, and she says that the register in the family Bible\r\nsupports the assertion that a half-century of rolling years have passed\r\nbefore her.--The Herald.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony looked her very best last night, and let the truth be said,\r\neven should it be followed by persecuting proposals from the bachelors,\r\nshe didn't look much more than five-and-twenty. The genial salutations\r\nand happy surroundings of the hour effaced for the time those lines\r\nwhich care and labor and fifty years will make, however pure the soul\r\nwithin. Miss Anthony was happy and she looked it.... She wears her years\r\nand honors well. May we live till the celebration of her centenary, and\r\nshe read the report thereof next day in the columns of the Evening\r\nMail.--The Mail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn these latter days the aspirations and activities of woman are greatly\r\nquickened, and her day of pure and perfect freedom seems near at hand.\r\nWhen the year of jubilee shall at last ring in, no name will be more\r\nhighly honored than that of Miss Susan B. Anthony; and her honors have\r\nbeen well deserved. Early and late, in season and out, in places high\r\nand low, all over this broad land, by voice and pen, has she labored\r\nwith unflagging zeal for the exalted liberty of woman.... Men who have\r\nhonored mothers, pure sisters, devoted wives and loving daughters, owe\r\nto Miss Anthony a heavy debt of gratitude for her life-work in behalf of\r\nwomen.--The Globe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony's reception has been one of the events of the week.... Men\r\nwho have expended about half of the time and half of the energy in the\r\nbusiness of money-making which Miss Anthony has expended in benefiting\r\nthe race, have become millionaires, and have been held up to the rising\r\ngeneration as examples of energy and industry worthy of imitation.\r\nBronzes have been erected and numerous biographies written to do them\r\nhonor. Had Miss Anthony labored for herself as devotedly as she has for\r\nothers, she would no doubt have received the usual reward in greenbacks;\r\nand but for the fact of her being a woman, might have had a bronze\r\nerected in her honor.--The Courier.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not always true that \"the good die young,\" for Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony has lived to celebrate her fiftieth birthday.... Right glad are\r\nwe that the anniversary was observed with due pomp and circumstance. No\r\nkindly tribute to great moral worth is too good for this good woman. As\r\none of the chief heroines of our generation, she abundantly deserves all\r\nthe honors which were paid her on that festal night. There are many\r\npublic-spirited workers in our busy land; many noble souls who have\r\ndevoted their life-long energies to the elevation of their\r\nfellow-beings; many moral pioneers, who, when they die, will leave the\r\nworld better than they found it; and conspicuous among these is the\r\nstaunch, unwearied and indomitable woman who, at the end of half a\r\ncentury of life, can remember but few idle or wasted days. If Miss\r\nAnthony's persevering efforts in behalf of her sex are not worthy of\r\ngenerous praise, then there is no just fame due to a brave career. If\r\nher methods have sometimes lacked soundness of judgment, they have never\r\nlacked nobility of purpose. There exists a peculiar, invaluable and\r\ntime-honored class of plain and substantial women who are said to be \"as\r\nhonest as the day is long;\" and Susan B. Anthony is the queen of this\r\nroyal race. Dauntless and tireless as the sterner sex, sympathetic and\r\ntender as the gentler, we sometimes think that she is both man and woman\r\nin one. She is one of the sterling characters of our day. The whole\r\npeople ought to rejoice that such a woman was born, has lived and still\r\ntoils.--The Independent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOut of scores of letters received space allows the reproduction of but a\r\nfew:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall always be present in sympathy with any number of people who will\r\nexpress their admiration of the sterling traits which adorn the life and\r\ncharacter of the lady who now passes the fiftieth anniversary of her\r\nmost devoted and unselfish life. I am glad to tender the legal\r\nrepresentative of a dollar for each of these years, with the confident\r\nassurance of the early triumph of that cause to which her life has been\r\nsingularly devoted. This greenback is no surer of being redeemed in gold\r\nthan is my confidence in the golden era of legal enfranchisement for\r\nwoman!... Long before Miss Anthony sees her \"threescore and ten,\" the\r\npolitical equality of all American citizens will be fully established.\r\nWith sentiments of the highest esteem, I am, very cordially and truly,\r\n\r\n                                             S. C. POMEROY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... God bless her, and may she live many happy, joyous years! That she\r\nand her noble co-workers are soon to see the complete triumph of the\r\nwoman's cause I firmly believe. And when in after years the great\r\nbenefactors of this century are sought for, Susan B. Anthony's name will\r\nbe found occupying one of the highest niches in the temple of honest\r\nfame. Truly yours,\r\n\r\n                         J. P. ROOT. [Lieutenant-Governor of Kansas.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... Enclosed is a check for $50, one for each year of your life. Will\r\nagree to give you the same pro rata sum on your one hundredth, birthday.\r\nWith love, your brother,\r\n\r\n                                             D. R. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere will be among those who sympathize with and rejoice in your\r\nlabors, no lack of testimony tonight to their persistency and value; but\r\nfrom one who deplores both, you will perhaps be willing to hear a\r\nhearty, cordial, admiring expression of the regard he is nevertheless\r\nforced to cherish for the sincerity and the unmistakably disinterested\r\ndevotion which has marked your long and hopeful work in the cause you\r\nhold so dear and serve so faithfully. I can not wish you the success you\r\nseek--let me give you this better wish, that the anniversary your\r\nfriends celebrate tonight may never bring fewer tokens of regard than\r\nnow, and never find you seeming less the faithful worker \"of cheerful\r\nyesterdays and confident tomorrows.\" With renewed congratulations I am,\r\nvery cordially yours,\r\n\r\n                                             WHITELAW REID.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI could not be where I longed to be last evening, where I could look\r\nupon the toilworn face of the true, tried and never found wanting--the\r\none of all others who has borne the heat of the day, and that without\r\nwilting or complaining ever hopeful and ever pursuing \"the even tenor of\r\nher way.\" Absence shall not keep from thee my mite, and how I wish it\r\nwere ten, yes, twenty times as much, but here it is with my love,\r\nrespect and genuine friendship. Be of brave heart and believe that I am\r\nthy fast friend,\r\n\r\n                                             ABBY HOPPER GIBBONS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYours is a \"golden wedding\" indeed--for the fiftieth anniversary of a\r\nlife that has been wedded to a great cause is a far more glorious golden\r\nwedding than those which generally go by that name. Accept my heartiest\r\nwishes for your welfare and for the success of your novel celebration.\r\nHeretofore the privilege of growing old and possessing common sense has\r\nbelonged exclusively to the other sex. Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                             FRANCES ELLEN BURR.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPlease accept the enclosed check of $50, as a slight token of regard\r\nfrom our absent trio. As I hardly need tell you, the lion's share of\r\nthis birthday gift is sent by my father, but neither mother nor I will\r\nadmit that in the unsubstantial, and yet I hope not valueless part of\r\nthe offering, the personal regard and appreciation of your noble work\r\nfor woman which accompany it, our contribution is any less than his. I\r\nremain yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                                             LAURA CURTIS BULLARD.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou have worked for the slave and for woman. Your fifty years shine\r\nabout you and rest like a halo of glory around your head.... Fifty years\r\ntoday! When that half-century again rolls around, you and I will be in\r\nour graves and our names and work will stand back of us to all time. But\r\ninto that future I look with prophetic eye to see woman no longer\r\nenslaved, and to find, not only on this continent, but over the world,\r\nas benefactor of the race, the name of Susan B. Anthony. Your\r\naffectionate friend,\r\n\r\n                                             MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy good husband in writing from Toledo says: \"Tell Susan that all the\r\nnewspaper accounts taken together could not increase the pride which I\r\nhave long felt in her pertinacious, obstinate, fault-finding, raspish,\r\nstrong-minded, dogmatic and grand career. God bless her!\" To all of\r\nwhich I subscribe most affectionately,\r\n\r\n                                             ELIZABETH R. TILTON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... If your Bible says you are fifty, I will try to be as reverential as\r\npossible when next we meet. I wish you similar health and strength when\r\nyou are seventy-five--you'll find no change in me. I send you by express\r\ntoday Whittier's poems. Ever affectionately,\r\n\r\n                                             ELLEN WRIGHT GARRISON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll the people who know you and who don't know you were given\r\nopportunity to utter their good wishes, and poor me, wandering across\r\nthese western spaces, quite left out in the cold! Please ma'am, why did\r\nI know nothing of your reception till it was all over? I should have\r\nsent you what I now send--a gray silk gown, wherein you are to make\r\nyourself fine and grand, and a draft for $200 as a little nest-egg.\r\n\r\nIf I only had a happy ease with my pen, how glad I would have been to\r\nput on paper in glowing words just what I think of the faithful,\r\nunselfish, earnest, single-minded, courageous years, which my dear old\r\nSusan has given to the service of humanity. How, through poverty and\r\npersecution, evil tongues and slanderous words, ridicule and reproach,\r\nshe has said, \"Nothing shall daunt me; 'tis God's service;\" and so\r\nspeaking, has held fast the profession of her faith without wavering....\r\nGod bless her! God bless her! The tears come to my eyes as I write that\r\nbenediction, and think how gently and earnestly men and women alike in\r\ntime to come will repeat it when her name is mentioned; when those same\r\nmen and women shall see her life and her work, not as now \"through a\r\nglass darkly,\" but as those who gaze through the sunshine of truth.\r\nGood-by, dear friend--many happy years for you, prays your loving\r\n\r\n                                             ANNA E.

So, if need be, fight as valiantly, dear sister, for the\r\nnext twenty years as for the last, or at least till woman's right to a\r\nvoice in the laws by which she is governed shall be acknowledged in\r\nevery State and Territory of our country. Affectionately your sister,\r\n\r\n                                             MARY S.

What woman has gained already, and it is much, what\r\nI and others have been able to achieve in professional life, must be\r\nmainly ascribed to you, and such as you....

I wish I could have been there\r\nto assist at the merrymaking. Miss Manning has kindly offered to take a\r\nlittle remembrance [an Etruscan gold and garnet pin] to you when she\r\ngoes home, which you are to wear with that new silk dress. You see how\r\nselfish I am. I wish to compel you not only to think of me, but to\r\nassociate me in your mind with our peerless Anna, God bless the dear\r\nchild!

In addition were a broché shawl\r\nfrom Mrs. Stanton, gold watch, chain and pin from Miss Sarah Johnston,\r\npen-and-ink sketch from Eliza Greatorex, point and duchesse lace collars\r\nand handkerchiefs, sets of books, engravings, gold pens, pocket-books,\r\ntravelling case, and floral offerings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV--PAGE 435.\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n_Delivered in twenty-nine of the post-office districts of Monroe, and\r\ntwenty-one of Ontario, in Miss Anthony's canvass of those counties prior\r\nto her trial in June, 1873._\r\n\r\n_Friends and Fellow-Citizens:_--I stand before you under indictment for\r\nthe alleged crime of having voted at the last presidential election,\r\nwithout having a lawful right to vote. It shall be my work this evening\r\nto prove to you that in thus doing, I not only committed no crime, but\r\ninstead simply exercised my citizen's right, guaranteed to me and all\r\nUnited States citizens by the National Constitution beyond the power of\r\nany State to deny.\r\n\r\nOur democratic-republican government is based on the idea of the natural\r\nright of every individual member thereof to a voice and a vote in making\r\nand executing the laws. We assert the province of government to be to\r\nsecure the people in the enjoyment of their inalienable rights. We throw\r\nto the winds the old dogma that government can give rights. No one\r\ndenies that before governments were organized each individual possessed\r\nthe right to protect his own life, liberty and property. When 100 or\r\n1,000,000 people enter into a free government, they do not barter away\r\ntheir natural rights; they simply pledge themselves to protect each\r\nother in the enjoyment of them through prescribed judicial and\r\nlegislative tribunals. They agree to abandon the methods of brute force\r\nin the adjustment of their differences and adopt those of civilization.\r\nNor can you find a word in any of the grand documents left us by the\r\nfathers which assumes for government the power to create or to confer\r\nrights. The Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution,\r\nthe constitutions of the several States and the organic laws of the\r\nTerritories, all alike propose to _protect_ the people in the exercise\r\nof their God-given rights. Not one of them pretends to bestow rights.\r\n\r\n     All men are created equal, and endowed by their Creator with\r\n     certain inalienable rights. Among these are life, liberty and the\r\n     pursuit of happiness. To secure these, governments are instituted\r\n     among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the\r\n     governed.\r\n\r\nHere is no shadow of government authority over rights, or exclusion of\r\nany class from their full and equal enjoyment. Here is pronounced the\r\nright of all men, and \"consequently,\" as the Quaker preacher said, \"of\r\nall women,\" to a voice in the government. And here, in this first\r\nparagraph of the Declaration, is the assertion of the natural right of\r\nall to the ballot; for how can \"the consent of the governed\" be given,\r\nif the right to vote be denied? Again:\r\n\r\n     Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,\r\n     it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to\r\n     institute a new government, laying its foundations on such\r\n     principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them\r\n     shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\r\n\r\nSurely the right of the whole people to vote is here clearly implied;\r\nfor however destructive to their happiness this government might become,\r\na disfranchised class could neither alter nor abolish it, nor institute\r\na new one, except by the old brute force method of insurrection and\r\nrebellion. One-half of the people of this nation today are utterly\r\npowerless to blot from the statute books an unjust law, or to write\r\nthere a new and a just one. The women, dissatisfied as they are with\r\nthis form of government, that enforces taxation without\r\nrepresentation--that compels them to obey laws to which they never have\r\ngiven their consent--that imprisons and hangs them without a trial by a\r\njury of their peers--that robs them, in marriage, of the custody of\r\ntheir own persons, wages and children--are this half of the people who\r\nare left wholly at the mercy of the other half, in direct violation of\r\nthe spirit and letter of the declarations of the framers of this\r\ngovernment, every one of which was based on the immutable principle of\r\nequal rights to all. By these declarations, kings, popes, priests,\r\naristocrats, all were alike dethroned and placed on a common level,\r\npolitically, with the lowliest born subject or serf. By them, too, men,\r\nas such, were deprived of their divine right to rule and placed on a\r\npolitical level with women. By the practice of these declarations all\r\nclass and caste distinctions would be abolished, and slave, serf,\r\nplebeian, wife, woman, all alike rise from their subject position to the\r\nbroader platform of equality.\r\n\r\nThe preamble of the Federal Constitution says:\r\n\r\n     We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more\r\n     perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,\r\n     provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare and\r\n     secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do\r\n     ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of\r\n     America.\r\n\r\nIt was we, the people, not we, the white male citizens, nor we, the male\r\ncitizens; but we, the whole people, who formed this Union. We formed it\r\nnot to give the blessings of liberty but to secure them; not to the half\r\nof ourselves and the half of our posterity, but to the whole\r\npeople--women as well as men. It is downright mockery to talk to women\r\nof their enjoyment of the blessings of liberty while they are denied the\r\nonly means of securing them provided by this democratic-republican\r\ngovernment--the ballot.\r\n\r\nThe early journals of Congress show that, when the committee reported to\r\nthat body the original articles of confederation, the very first one\r\nwhich became the subject of discussion was that respecting equality of\r\nsuffrage. Article IV said:\r\n\r\n     The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and\r\n     intercourse between the people of the different States of this\r\n     Union, the free inhabitants of each of the States (paupers,\r\n     vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted) shall be entitled to\r\n     all the privileges and immunities of the free citizens of the\r\n     several States.\r\n\r\nThus, at the very beginning, did the fathers see the necessity of the\r\nuniversal application of the great principle of equal rights to all, in\r\norder to produce the desired result--a harmonious union and a\r\nhomogeneous people.\r\n\r\nLuther Martin, attorney-general of Maryland, in his report to the\r\nlegislature of that State of the convention which framed the United\r\nStates Constitution, said:\r\n\r\n     Those who advocated the equality of suffrage took the matter up on\r\n     the original principles of government: that the reason why each\r\n     individual man in forming a State government should have an equal\r\n     vote, is because each individual, before he enters into government,\r\n     is equally free and equally independent.\r\n\r\nJames Madison said:\r\n\r\n     Under every view of the subject, it seems indispensable that the\r\n     mass of the citizens should not be without a voice in making the\r\n     laws which they are to obey, and in choosing the magistrates who\r\n     are to administer them.... Let it be remembered, finally, that it\r\n     has ever been the pride and the boast of America that the rights\r\n     for which she contended were the rights of human nature.\r\n\r\nThese assertions by the framers of the United States Constitution of the\r\nequal and natural right of all the people to a voice in the government,\r\nhave been affirmed and reaffirmed by the leading statesmen of the nation\r\nthroughout the entire history of our government. Thaddeus Stevens, of\r\nPennsylvania, said in 1866: \"I have made up my mind that the elective\r\nfranchise is one of the inalienable rights meant to be secured by the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.\" B. Gratz Brown, of Missouri, in the three\r\ndays' discussion in the United States Senate in 1866, on Senator Cowan's\r\nmotion to strike \"male\" from the District of Columbia suffrage bill,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Mr. President, I say here on the floor of the American Senate, I\r\n     stand for universal suffrage and as a matter of fundamental\r\n     principle, do not recognize the right of society to limit it on any\r\n     ground of race or sex. I will go farther and say that I recognize\r\n     the right of franchise as being intrinsically a natural right. I do\r\n     not believe that society is authorized to impose any limitations\r\n     upon it that do not spring out of the necessities of the social\r\n     state itself. Sir, I have been shocked, in the course of this\r\n     debate, to hear senators declare this right only a conventional and\r\n     political arrangement, a privilege yielded to you and me and\r\n     others; not a right in any sense, only a concession! Mr. President,\r\n     I do not hold my liberties by any such tenure. On the contrary, I\r\n     believe that whenever you establish that doctrine, whenever you\r\n     crystallize that idea in the public mind of this country, you ring\r\n     the death-knell of American liberties.\r\n\r\nCharles Sumner, in his brave protests against the Fourteenth and\r\nFifteenth Amendments, insisted that so soon as by the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment the slaves became free men, the original powers of the United\r\nStates Constitution guaranteed to them equal rights--the right to vote\r\nand to be voted for. In closing one of his great speeches he said:\r\n\r\n     I do not hesitate to say that when the slaves of our country became\r\n     \"citizens\" they took their place in the body politic as a component\r\n     part of the \"people,\" entitled to equal rights and under the\r\n     protection of these two guardian principles: First, that all just\r\n     governments stand on the consent of the governed; and second, that\r\n     taxation without representation is tyranny; and these rights it is\r\n     the duty of Congress to guarantee as essential to the idea of a\r\n     republic.\r\n\r\nThe preamble of the constitution of the State of New York declares the\r\nsame purpose. It says: \"We, the people of the State of New York,\r\ngrateful to Almighty God for our freedom, in order to secure its\r\nblessings, do establish this constitution.\" Here is not the slightest\r\nintimation either of receiving freedom from the United States\r\nConstitution, or of the State's conferring the blessings of liberty upon\r\nthe people; and the same is true of every other State constitution. Each\r\nand all declare rights God-given, and that to secure the people in the\r\nenjoyment of their inalienable rights is their one and only object in\r\nordaining and establishing government. All of the State constitutions\r\nare equally emphatic in their recognition of the ballot as the means of\r\nsecuring the people in the enjoyment of these rights. Article I of the\r\nNew York State constitution says:\r\n\r\n     No member of this State shall be disfranchised or deprived of the\r\n     rights or privileges secured to any citizen thereof, unless by the\r\n     law of the land, or the judgment of his peers.\r\n\r\nSo carefully guarded is the citizen's right to vote, that the\r\nconstitution makes special mention of all who may be excluded. It says:\r\n\"Laws may be passed excluding from the right of suffrage all persons who\r\nhave been or may be convicted of bribery, larceny or any infamous\r\ncrime.\"\r\n\r\nIn naming the various employments which shall not affect the residence\r\nof voters, Section 3, Article II, says \"that neither being kept in any\r\nalmshouse, or other asylum, at public expense, nor being confined in any\r\npublic prison, shall deprive a person of his residence,\" and hence of\r\nhis vote. Thus is the right of voting most sacredly hedged about. The\r\nonly seeming permission in the New York State constitution for the\r\ndisfranchisement of women is in Section 1, Article II, which says:\r\n\"Every male citizen of the age of twenty-one years, etc., shall be\r\nentitled to vote.\"\r\n\r\nBut I submit that in view of the explicit assertions of the equal right\r\nof the whole people, both in the preamble and previous article of the\r\nconstitution, this omission of the adjective \"female\" should not be\r\nconstrued into a denial; but instead should be considered as of no\r\neffect. Mark the direct prohibition, \"No member of this State shall be\r\ndisfranchised, unless by the law of the land, or the judgment of his\r\npeers.\" \"The law of the land\" is the United States Constitution; and\r\nthere is no provision in that document which can be fairly construed\r\ninto a permission to the States to deprive any class of citizens of\r\ntheir right to vote. Hence New York can get no power from that source to\r\ndisfranchise one entire half of her members. Nor has \"the judgment of\r\ntheir peers\" been pronounced against women exercising their right to\r\nvote; no disfranchised person is allowed to be judge or juror--and none\r\nbut disfranchised persons can be women's peers. Nor has the legislature\r\npassed laws excluding women as a class on account of idiocy or lunacy;\r\nnor have the courts convicted them of bribery, larceny or any infamous\r\ncrime. Clearly, then, there is no constitutional ground for the\r\nexclusion of women from the ballot-box in the State of New York. No\r\nbarriers whatever stand today between women and the exercise of their\r\nright to vote save those of precedent and prejudice, which refuse to\r\nexpunge the word \"male\" from the constitution.\r\n\r\nThe clauses of the United States Constitution cited by our opponents as\r\ngiving power to the States to disfranchise any classes of citizens they\r\nplease, are contained in Sections 2 and 4, Article I. The second says:\r\n\r\n     The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen\r\n     every second year by the people of the several States; and the\r\n     electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for\r\n     electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislature.\r\n\r\nThis can not be construed into a concession to the States of the power\r\nto destroy the right to become an elector, but simply to prescribe what\r\nshall be the qualifications, such as competency of intellect, maturity\r\nof age, length of residence, that shall be deemed necessary to enable\r\nthem to make an intelligent choice of candidates. If, as our opponents\r\nassert, it is the duty of the United States to protect citizens in the\r\nseveral States against higher or different qualifications for electors\r\nfor representatives in Congress than for members of the Assembly, then\r\nit must be equally imperative for the national government to interfere\r\nwith the States, and forbid them from arbitrarily cutting off the right\r\nof one-half the people to become electors altogether. Section 4 says:\r\n\r\n     The times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and\r\n     representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the\r\n     legislature thereof; but Congress may at any time, by law, make or\r\n     alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing\r\n     senators.\r\n\r\nHere is conceded to the States only the power to prescribe times, places\r\nand manner of holding the elections; and even with these Congress may\r\ninterfere in all excepting the mere place of choosing senators. Thus,\r\nyou see, there is not the slightest permission for the States to\r\ndiscriminate against the right of any class of citizens to vote. Surely,\r\nto regulate can not be to annihilate; to qualify can not be wholly to\r\ndeprive. To this principle every true Democrat and Republican said amen,\r\nwhen applied to black men by Senator Sumner in his great speeches from\r\n1865 to 1869 for equal rights to all; and when, in 1871, I asked that\r\nsenator to declare the power of the United States Constitution to\r\nprotect women in their right to vote--as he had done for black men--he\r\nhanded me a copy of all his speeches during that reconstruction period,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n     Put \"sex\" where I have \"race\" or \"color,\" and you have here the\r\n     best and strongest argument I can make for woman. There is not a\r\n     doubt but women have the constitutional right to vote, and I will\r\n     never vote for a Sixteenth Amendment to guarantee it to them. I\r\n     voted for both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth under protest; would\r\n     never have done it but for the pressing emergency of that hour;\r\n     would have insisted that the power of the original Constitution to\r\n     protect all citizens in the equal enjoyment of their rights should\r\n     have been vindicated through the courts. But the newly-made\r\n     freedmen had neither the intelligence, wealth nor time to await\r\n     that slow process. Women do possess all these in an eminent degree,\r\n     and I insist that they shall appeal to the courts, and through them\r\n     establish the powers of our American magna charta to protect every\r\n     citizen of the republic.\r\n\r\nBut, friends, when in accordance with Senator Sumner's counsel I went to\r\nthe ballot-box, last November, and exercised my citizen's right to vote,\r\nthe courts did not wait for me to appeal to them--they appealed to me,\r\nand indicted me on the charge of having voted illegally. Putting sex\r\nwhere he did color, Senator Sumner would have said:\r\n\r\n     Qualifications can not be in their nature permanent or\r\n     insurmountable. Sex can not be a qualification any more than size,\r\n     race, color or previous condition of servitude. A permanent or\r\n     insurmountable qualification is equivalent to a deprivation of the\r\n     suffrage. In other words, it is the tyranny of taxation without\r\n     representation, against which our Revolutionary mothers, as well as\r\n     fathers, rebelled.\r\n\r\nFor any State to make sex a qualification, which must ever result in the\r\ndisfranchisement of one entire half of the people, is to pass a bill of\r\nattainder, an ex post facto law, and is therefore a violation of the\r\nsupreme law of the land. By it the blessings of liberty are forever\r\nwithheld from women and their female posterity. For them, this\r\ngovernment has no just powers derived from the consent of the governed.\r\nFor them this government is not a democracy; it is not a republic. It is\r\nthe most odious aristocracy ever established on the face of the globe.\r\nAn oligarchy of wealth, where the rich govern the poor; an oligarchy of\r\nlearning, where the educated govern the ignorant; or even an oligarchy\r\nof race, where the Saxon rules the African, might be endured; but this\r\noligarchy of sex which makes father, brothers, husband, sons, the\r\noligarchs over the mother and sisters, the wife and daughters of every\r\nhousehold; which ordains all men sovereigns, all women subjects--carries\r\ndiscord and rebellion into every home of the nation. This most odious\r\naristocracy exists, too, in the face of Section 4, Article IV, which\r\nsays: \"The United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a\r\nrepublican form of government.\"\r\n\r\nWhat, I ask you, is the distinctive difference between the inhabitants\r\nof a monarchical and those of a republican form of government, save that\r\nin the monarchical the people are subjects, helpless, powerless, bound\r\nto obey laws made by political superiors; while in the republican the\r\npeople are citizens, individual sovereigns, all clothed with equal power\r\nto make and unmake both their laws and law-makers? The moment you\r\ndeprive a person of his right to a voice in the government, you degrade\r\nhim from the status of a citizen of the republic to that of a subject.\r\nIt matters very little to him whether his monarch be an individual\r\ntyrant, as is the Czar of Russia, or a 15,000,000 headed monster, as\r\nhere in the United States; he is a powerless subject, serf or slave; not\r\nin any sense a free and independent citizen.\r\n\r\nIt is urged that the use of the masculine pronouns _he, his_ and _him_\r\nin all the constitutions and laws, is proof that only men were meant to\r\nbe included in their provisions. If you insist on this version of the\r\nletter of the law, we shall insist that you be consistent and accept the\r\nother horn of the dilemma, which would compel you to exempt women from\r\ntaxation for the support of the government and from penalties for the\r\nviolation of laws. There is no _she_ or _her_ or _hers_ in the tax laws,\r\nand this is equally true of all the criminal laws.\r\n\r\nTake for example the civil rights law which I am charged with having\r\nviolated; not only are all the pronouns in it masculine, but everybody\r\nknows that it was intended expressly to hinder the rebel men from\r\nvoting. It reads, \"If any person shall knowingly vote without _his_\r\nhaving a lawful right.\" It was precisely so with all the papers served\r\non me the United States marshal's warrant, the bail-bond, the petition\r\nfor habeas corpus, the bill of indictment--not one of them had a\r\nfeminine pronoun; but to make them applicable to me, the clerk of the\r\ncourt prefixed an \"s\" to the \"he\" and made \"her\" out of \"his\" and \"him;\"\r\nand I insist if government officials may thus manipulate the pronouns to\r\ntax, fine, imprison and hang women, it is their duty to thus change them\r\nin order to protect us in our right to vote.\r\n\r\nSo long as any classes of men were denied this right, the government\r\nmade a show of consistency by exempting them from taxation. When a\r\nproperty qualification of $250 was required of black men in New York,\r\nthey were not compelled to pay taxes so long as they were content to\r\nreport themselves worth less than that sum; but the moment the black\r\nman died and his property fell to his widow or daughter, the black\r\nwoman's name was put on the assessor's list and she was compelled to pay\r\ntaxes on this same property. This also is true of ministers in New York.\r\nSo long as the minister lives, he is exempted from taxation on $1,500 of\r\nproperty, but the moment the breath leaves his body, his widow's name\r\ngoes on the assessor's list and she has to pay taxes on the $1,500. So\r\nmuch for special legislation in favor of women!\r\n\r\nIn all the penalties and burdens of government (except the military)\r\nwomen are reckoned as citizens, equally with men. Also, in all the\r\nprivileges and immunities, save those of the jury and the ballot-box,\r\nthe foundation on which rest all the others. The United States\r\ngovernment not only taxes, fines, imprisons and hangs women, but it\r\nallows them to pre-empt lands, register ships and take out passports and\r\nnaturalization papers. Not only does the law permit single women and\r\nwidows the right of naturalization, but Section 2 says, \"A married woman\r\nmay be naturalized without the concurrence of her husband;\" (I wonder\r\nthe fathers were not afraid of creating discord in the families of\r\nforeigners;) and again:\r\n\r\n     When an alien, having complied with the law and declared his\r\n     intention to become a citizen, dies before he is actually\r\n     naturalized, his widow and children shall be considered citizens,\r\n     entitled to all rights and privileges as such, on taking the\r\n     required oath.\r\n\r\nIf a foreign born woman by becoming a naturalized citizen is entitled to\r\nall the rights and privileges of citizenship, do not these include the\r\nballot which would have belonged to her husband? If this is true of a\r\nnaturalized woman, is it not equally true of one who is native born?\r\n\r\nThe question of the masculine pronouns--yes, and nouns too--was settled\r\nby the United States Supreme Court, in the case of Silver _versus_ Ladd,\r\nDecember, 1868. The court said:\r\n\r\n     In construing a benevolent statute of the government, made for the\r\n     benefit of its own citizens, inviting and encouraging them to\r\n     settle on its distant public lands, the words \"single man\" and\r\n     \"unmarried man\" may, especially if aided by the context and other\r\n     parts of the statute, be taken in a generic sense. Held,\r\n     accordingly, that the Fourth Section of the Act of Congress, of\r\n     September 21, 1850, granting by way of donation lands in Oregon\r\n     Territory to every white settler or occupant, American half-breed\r\n     Indians included, embraced within the term single man an unmarried\r\n     woman.\r\n\r\nThough the words persons, people, inhabitants, electors, citizens, are\r\nall used indiscriminately in the national and State constitutions, there\r\nwas always a conflict of opinion, prior to the war, as to whether they\r\nwere synonymous terms, but whatever room there was for doubt, under the\r\nold regime, the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment settled that\r\nquestion forever in its first sentence:\r\n\r\n     All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject\r\n     to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States, and\r\n     of the State wherein they reside.\r\n\r\nThe second settles the equal status of all citizens:\r\n\r\n     No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the\r\n     privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor\r\n     shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property\r\n     without due process of law, or deny to any person within its\r\n     jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\nThe only question left to be settled now is: Are women persons? I\r\nscarcely believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood to say\r\nthey are not. Being persons, then, women are citizens, and no State has\r\na right to make any new law, or to enforce any old law, which shall\r\nabridge their privileges or immunities. Hence, every discrimination\r\nagainst women in the constitutions and laws of the several States is\r\ntoday null and void, precisely as is every one against negroes.\r\n\r\nIs the right to vote one of the privileges or immunities of citizens? I\r\nthink the disfranchised ex-rebels and ex-State prisoners all will agree\r\nthat it is not only one of them, but the one without which all the\r\nothers are nothing. Seek first the kingdom of the ballot and all things\r\nelse shall be added, is the political injunction.\r\n\r\nWebster, Worcester and Bouvier all define citizen to be a person, in the\r\nUnited States, entitled to vote and hold office. Prior to the adoption\r\nof the Thirteenth Amendment, by which slavery was forever abolished and\r\nblack men transformed from property to persons, the judicial opinions of\r\nthe country had always been in harmony with this definition: In order to\r\nbe a citizen one must be a voter. Associate-Justice Washington, in\r\ndefining the privileges and immunities of the citizen, more than fifty\r\nyears ago, said: \"They include all such privileges as are fundamental in\r\ntheir nature; and among them is the right to exercise the elective\r\nfranchise, and to hold office.\" Even the Dred Scott decision, pronounced\r\nby the Abolitionists and Republicans infamous because it virtually\r\ndeclared \"black men had no rights white men were bound to respect,\" gave\r\nthis true and logical conclusion, that to be one of the people was to be\r\na citizen and a voter.\r\n\r\nChief-Justice Daniels said:\r\n\r\n     There is not, it is believed, to be found in the theories of\r\n     writers on government, or in any actual experiment heretofore made,\r\n     an exposition of the term citizen which has not been considered as\r\n     conferring the actual possession and enjoyment of an entire\r\n     equality of privileges, civil and political.\r\n\r\nAssociate-Justice Taney said:\r\n\r\n     The words \"people of the United States\" and \"citizens\" are\r\n     synonymous terms, and mean the same thing. They both describe the\r\n     political body, who, according to our republican institutions, form\r\n     the sovereignty, and who hold the power and conduct the government\r\n     through their representatives. They are what we familiarly call\r\n     \"the sovereign people,\" and every citizen is one of this people,\r\n     and a constituent member of this sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThus does Judge Taney's decision, which was so terrible a ban to the\r\nblack man while he was a slave, now that he is a person and no longer\r\nproperty, pronounce him a citizen, possessed of entire equality of\r\nprivileges, civil and political; and not only the black man, but the\r\nblack woman, and all women. It was not until after the abolition of\r\nslavery, by which the negroes became free men and hence citizens, that\r\nany contrary opinion was rendered. U. S. Attorney-General Bates then\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     The Constitution uses the word \"citizen\" only to express the\r\n     political quality, [not equality, mark,] of the individual in his\r\n     relation to the nation; to declare that he is a member of the body\r\n     politic, and bound to it by the reciprocal obligations of\r\n     allegiance on the one side and protection on the other. The\r\n     phrase, \"a citizen of the United States,\" without addition or\r\n     qualification, means neither more nor less than a member of the\r\n     nation.\r\n\r\nThen, to be a citizen of this republic is no more than to be a subject\r\nof an empire. You and I, and all true and patriotic citizens, must\r\nrepudiate this base conclusion. We all know that American citizenship,\r\nwithout addition or qualification, means the possession of equal rights,\r\ncivil and political. We all know that the crowning glory of every\r\ncitizen of the United States is that he can either give or withhold his\r\nvote from every law and every legislator under the government.\r\n\r\nDid \"I am a Roman citizen\" mean nothing more than that I am a \"member\"\r\nof the body politic of the republic of Rome, bound to it by the\r\nreciprocal obligations of allegiance on the one side and protection on\r\nthe other? When you, young man, shall travel abroad, among the\r\nmonarchies of the old world, and there proudly boast yourself an\r\n\"American citizen,\" will you thereby declare yourself neither more nor\r\nless than a \"member\" of the American nation?\r\n\r\nThis opinion of Attorney-General Bates, that a black citizen was not a\r\nvoter, given merely to suit the political exigency of the Republican\r\nparty in that transition hour between emancipation and enfranchisement,\r\nwas no less infamous, in spirit or purpose, than was the decision of\r\nJudge Taney, that a black man was not one of the people, rendered in the\r\ninterest and at the behest of the old Democratic party in its darkest\r\nhour of subjection to the slave power. Nevertheless, all of the adverse\r\narguments, congressional reports and judicial opinions, thus far, have\r\nbeen based on this purely partisan, time-serving decision of General\r\nBates, that the normal condition of the citizen of the United States is\r\nthat of disfranchisement; that only such classes of citizens as have had\r\nspecial legislative guarantee have a legal right to vote.\r\n\r\nIf this decision of Attorney-General Bates was infamous, as against\r\nblack men, but yesterday plantation slaves, what shall we pronounce upon\r\nJudge Bingham, in the House of Representatives, and Carpenter, in the\r\nSenate of the United States, for citing it against the women of the\r\nentire nation, vast numbers of whom are the peers of those honorable\r\ngentlemen themselves in morals, intellect, culture, wealth, family,\r\npaying taxes on large estates, and contributing equally with them and\r\ntheir sex, in every direction, to the growth, prosperity and well-being\r\nof the republic? And what shall be said of the judicial opinions of\r\nJudges Cartter, Jameson, McKay and Sharswood, all based upon this\r\naristocratic, monarchial idea of the right of one class to govern\r\nanother?\r\n\r\nI am proud to mention the names of the two United States judges who have\r\ngiven opinions honorable to our republican idea, and honorable to\r\nthemselves--Judge Howe, of Wyoming Territory, and Judge Underwood, of\r\nVirginia. The former gave it as his opinion a year ago, when the\r\nlegislature seemed likely to revoke the law enfranchising the women of\r\nthat Territory that, in case they succeeded, the women would still\r\npossess the right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment. The latter, in\r\nnoticing the recent decision of Judge Cartter, of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe District of Columbia, denying to women the right to vote under the\r\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, says:\r\n\r\n     If the people of the United States, by amendment of their\r\n     Constitution, could expunge, without any explanatory or assisting\r\n     legislation, an adjective of five letters from all State and local\r\n     constitutions, and thereby raise millions of our most ignorant\r\n     fellow-citizens to all of the rights and privileges of electors,\r\n     why should not the same people, by the same amendment, expunge an\r\n     adjective of four letters from the same State and local\r\n     constitutions, and thereby raise other millions of more educated\r\n     and better informed citizens to equal rights and privileges,\r\n     without explanatory or assisting legislation?\r\n\r\nIf the Fourteenth Amendment does not secure to all citizens the right to\r\nvote, for what purpose was that grand old charter of the fathers\r\nlumbered with its unwieldy proportions? The Republican party, and Judges\r\nHoward and Bingham, who drafted the document, pretended it was to do\r\nsomething for black men; and if that something were not to secure them\r\nin their right to vote and hold office, what could it have been? For by\r\nthe Thirteenth Amendment black men had become people, and hence were\r\nentitled to all the privileges and immunities of the government,\r\nprecisely as were the women of the country and foreign men not\r\nnaturalized. According to Associate-Justice Washington, they already\r\nhad:\r\n\r\n     Protection of the government, the enjoyment of life and liberty,\r\n     with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and\r\n     to pursue and obtain happiness and safety, subject to such\r\n     restraints as the government may justly prescribe for the general\r\n     welfare of the whole; the right of a citizen of one State to pass\r\n     through or to reside in any other State for the purpose of trade,\r\n     agriculture, professional pursuit, or otherwise; to claim the\r\n     benefit of the writ of habeas corpus, to institute and maintain\r\n     actions of any kind in the courts of the State; to take, hold, and\r\n     dispose of property, either real or personal, and an exemption from\r\n     higher taxes or impositions than are paid by the other citizens of\r\n     the State.\r\n\r\nThus, you see, those newly-freed men were in possession of every\r\npossible right, privilege and immunity of the government, except that of\r\nsuffrage, and hence needed no constitutional amendment for any other\r\npurpose. What right in this country has the Irishman the day after he\r\nreceives his naturalization papers that he did not possess the day\r\nbefore, save the right to vote and hold office? The Chinamen now\r\ncrowding our Pacific coast are in precisely the same position. What\r\nprivilege or immunity has California or Oregon the right to deny them,\r\nsave that of the ballot? Clearly, then, if the Fourteenth Amendment was\r\nnot to secure to black men their right to vote it did nothing for them,\r\nsince they possessed everything else before. But if it was intended to\r\nprohibit the States from denying or abridging their right to vote, then\r\nit did the same for all persons, white women included, born or\r\nnaturalized in the United States; for the amendment does not say that\r\nall male persons of African descent, but that all persons are citizens.\r\n\r\nThe second section is simply a threat to punish the States by reducing\r\ntheir representation on the floor of Congress, should they disfranchise\r\nany of their male citizens, and can not be construed into a sanction to\r\ndisfranchise female citizens, nor does it in any wise weaken or\r\ninvalidate the universal guarantee of the first section.\r\n\r\nHowever much the doctors of the law may disagree as to whether people\r\nand citizens, in the original Constitution, were one and the same, or\r\nwhether the privileges and immunities in the Fourteenth Amendment\r\ninclude the right of suffrage, the question of the citizen's right to\r\nvote is forever settled by the Fifteenth Amendment. \"The right of\r\ncitizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged\r\nby the United States, or by any State, on account of race, color or\r\nprevious condition of servitude.\" How can the State deny or abridge the\r\nright of the citizen, if the citizen does not possess it? There is no\r\nescape from the conclusion that to vote is the citizen's right, and the\r\nspecifications of race, color or previous condition of servitude can in\r\nno way impair the force of that emphatic assertion that the citizen's\r\nright to vote shall not be denied or abridged.\r\n\r\nThe political strategy of the second section of the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nfailing to coerce the rebel States into enfranchising their negroes, and\r\nthe necessities of the Republican party demanding their votes throughout\r\nthe South to ensure the re-election of Grant in 1872, that party was\r\ncompelled to place this positive prohibition of the Fifteenth Amendment\r\nupon the United States and all the States thereof.\r\n\r\nIf once we establish the false principle that United States citizenship\r\ndoes not carry with it the right to vote in every State in this Union,\r\nthere is no end to the petty tricks and cunning devices which will be\r\nattempted to exclude one and another class of citizens from the right of\r\nsuffrage. It will not always be the men combining to disfranchise all\r\nwomen; native born men combining to abridge the rights of all\r\nnaturalized citizens, as in Rhode Island. It will not always be the rich\r\nand educated who may combine to cut off the poor and ignorant; but we\r\nmay live to see the hard-working, uncultivated day laborers, foreign and\r\nnative born, learning the power of the ballot and their vast majority of\r\nnumbers, combine and amend State constitutions so as to disfranchise the\r\nVanderbilts, the Stewarts, the Conklings and the Fentons. It is a poor\r\nrule that won't work more ways than one. Establish this precedent, admit\r\nthe State's right to deny suffrage, and there is no limit to the\r\nconfusion, discord and disruption that may await us. There is and can be\r\nbut one safe principle of government--equal rights to all.\r\nDiscrimination against any class on account of color, race, nativity,\r\nsex, property, culture, can but embitter and disaffect that class, and\r\nthereby endanger the safety of the whole people. Clearly, then, the\r\nnational government not only must define the rights of citizens, but\r\nmust stretch out its powerful hand and protect them in every State in\r\nthis Union.\r\n\r\nIf, however, you will insist that the Fifteenth Amendment's emphatic\r\ninterdiction against robbing United States citizens of their suffrage\r\n\"on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude,\" is a\r\nrecognition of the right of either the United States or any State to\r\ndeprive them of the ballot for any or all other reasons, I will prove to\r\nyou that the class of citizens for whom I now plead are, by all the\r\nprinciples of our government and many of the laws of the States,\r\nincluded under the term \"previous condition of servitude.\"\r\n\r\nConsider first married women and their legal status. What is servitude?\r\n\"The condition of a slave.\" What is a slave? \"A person who is robbed of\r\nthe proceeds of his labor; a person who is subject to the will of\r\nanother.\" By the laws of Georgia, South Carolina and all the States of\r\nthe South, the negro had no right to the custody and control of his\r\nperson. He belonged to his master. If he were disobedient, the master\r\nhad the right to use correction. If the negro did not like the\r\ncorrection and ran away, the master had the right to use coercion to\r\nbring him back. By the laws of almost every State in this Union today,\r\nNorth as well as South, the married woman has no right to the custody\r\nand control of her person. The wife belongs to the husband; and if she\r\nrefuse obedience he may use moderate correction, and if she do not like\r\nhis moderate correction and leave his \"bed and board,\" the husband may\r\nuse moderate coercion to bring her back. The little word \"moderate,\" you\r\nsee, is the saving clause for the wife, and would doubtless be\r\noverstepped should her offended husband administer his correction with\r\nthe \"cat-o'-nine-tails,\" or accomplish his coercion with blood-hounds.\r\n\r\nAgain the slave had no right to the earnings of his hands, they belonged\r\nto his master; no right to the custody of his children, they belonged to\r\nhis master; no right to sue or be sued, or to testify in the courts. If\r\nhe committed a crime, it was the master who must sue or be sued. In many\r\nof the States there has been special legislation, giving married women\r\nthe right to property inherited or received by bequest, or earned by the\r\npursuit of any avocation outside the home; also giving them the right to\r\nsue and be sued in matters pertaining to such separate property; but not\r\na single State of this Union has ever secured the wife in the enjoyment\r\nof her right to equal ownership of the joint earnings of the marriage\r\ncopartnership. And since, in the nature of things, the vast majority of\r\nmarried women never earn a dollar by work outside their families, or\r\ninherit a dollar from their fathers, it follows that from the day of\r\ntheir marriage to the day of the death of their husbands not one of them\r\never has a dollar, except it shall please her husband to let her have\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn some of the States, also, laws have been passed giving to the mother\r\na joint right with the father in the guardianship of the children.\r\nTwenty-five years ago, when our woman's rights movement commenced, by\r\nthe laws of all the States the father had the sole custody and control\r\nof the children. No matter if he were a brutal, drunken libertine, he\r\nhad the legal right, without the mother's consent, to apprentice her\r\nsons to rumsellers or her daughters to brothel-keepers. He even could\r\nwill away an unborn child from the mother. In most of the States this\r\nlaw still prevails, and the mothers are utterly powerless.\r\n\r\nI doubt if there is, today, a State in this Union where a married woman\r\ncan sue or be sued for slander of character, and until recently there\r\nwas not one where she could sue or be sued for injury of person. However\r\ndamaging to the wife's reputation any slander may be, she is wholly\r\npowerless to institute legal proceedings against her accuser unless her\r\nhusband shall join with her; and how often have we heard of the husband\r\nconspiring with some outside barbarian to blast the good name of his\r\nwife? A married woman can not testify in courts in cases of joint\r\ninterest with her husband.\r\n\r\nA good farmer's wife in Illinois, who had all the rights she wanted, had\r\nhad made for herself a full set of false teeth. The dentist pronounced\r\nthem an admirable fit, and the wife declared it gave her fits to wear\r\nthem. The dentist sued the husband for his bill; his counsel brought the\r\nwife as witness; the judge ruled her off the stand, saying, \"A married\r\nwoman can not be a witness in matters of joint interest between herself\r\nand her husband.\" Think of it, ye good wives, the false teeth in your\r\nmouths are a joint interest with your husbands, about which you are\r\nlegally incompetent to speak! If a married woman is injured by\r\naccident, in nearly all of the States it is her husband who must sue,\r\nand it is to him that the damages will be awarded. In Massachusetts a\r\nmarried woman was severely injured by a defective sidewalk. Her husband\r\nsued the corporation and recovered $13,000 damages, which belong to him\r\nabsolutely, and whenever that unfortunate wife wishes a dollar of that\r\nmoney she must ask her husband for it; and if he be of a niggardly\r\nnature, she will hear him say, every time, \"What have you done with the\r\ntwenty-five cents I gave you yesterday?\" Isn't such a position\r\nhumiliating enough to be called \"servitude?\" That husband sued and\r\nobtained damages for the loss of the services of his wife, precisely as\r\nhe would have done had it been his ox, cow or horse; and exactly as the\r\nmaster, under the old regime, would have recovered for the services of\r\nhis slave.\r\n\r\nI submit the question, if the deprivation by law of the ownership of\r\none's own person, wages, property, children, the denial of the right as\r\nan individual to sue and be sued and testify in the courts, is not a\r\ncondition of servitude most bitter and absolute, even though under the\r\nsacred name of marriage? Does any lawyer doubt my statement of the legal\r\nstatus of married women? I will remind him of the fact that the common\r\nlaw of England prevails in every State but two in this Union, except\r\nwhere the legislature has enacted special laws annulling it. I am\r\nashamed that not one of the States yet has blotted from its statute\r\nbooks the old law of marriage, which, summed up in the fewest words\r\npossible, is in effect \"husband and wife are one, and that one the\r\nhusband.\"\r\n\r\nThus may all married women and widows, by the laws of the several\r\nStates, be technically included in the Fifteenth Amendment's\r\nspecification of \"condition of servitude,\" present or previous. The\r\nfacts also prove that, by all the great fundamental principles of our\r\nfree government, not only married women but the entire womanhood of the\r\nnation are in a \"condition of servitude\" as surely as were our\r\nRevolutionary fathers when they rebelled against King George. Women are\r\ntaxed without representation, governed without their consent, tried,\r\nconvicted and punished without a jury of their peers. Is all this\r\ntyranny any less humiliating and degrading to women under our\r\ndemocratic-republican government today than it was to men under their\r\naristocratic, monarchial government one hundred years ago? There is not\r\nan utterance of John Adams, John Hancock or Patrick Henry, but finds a\r\nliving response in the soul of every intelligent, patriotic woman of the\r\nnation. Show me a justice-loving woman property-holder, and I will show\r\nyou one whose soul is fired with all the indignation of 1776 every time\r\nthe tax-collector presents himself at her door. You will not find one\r\nsuch but feels her condition of servitude as galling as did James Otis\r\nwhen he said:\r\n\r\n     The very act of taxing exercised over those who are not represented\r\n     appears to me to be depriving them of one of their most essential\r\n     rights, and if continued seems to be in effect an entire\r\n     disfranchisement of every civil right. For what one civil right is\r\n     worth a rush after a man's property is subject to be taken from him\r\n     at pleasure without his consent? If a man is not his own assessor\r\n     in person, or by deputy, his liberty is gone, for he is wholly at\r\n     the mercy of others.\r\n\r\nWhat was the three-penny tax on tea or the paltry tax on paper and sugar\r\nto which our Revolutionary fathers were subjected, when compared with\r\nthe taxation of the women of this republic? And again, to show that\r\ndisfranchisement was precisely the slavery of which the fathers\r\ncomplained, allow me to cite Benjamin Franklin, who in those olden times\r\nwas admitted to be good authority, not merely in domestic but also in\r\npolitical economy:\r\n\r\n     Every man of the commonalty, except infants, insane persons and\r\n     criminals, is, of common right and the law of God, a freeman and\r\n     entitled to the free enjoyment of liberty. That liberty or freedom\r\n     consists in having an actual share in the appointment of those who\r\n     are to frame the laws, and who are to be the guardians of every\r\n     man's life, property and peace. For the all of one man is as dear\r\n     to him as the all of another; and the poor man has an equal right,\r\n     but more need, to have representatives in the legislature than the\r\n     rich one. They who have no voice or vote in the electing of\r\n     representatives do not enjoy liberty, but are absolutely enslaved\r\n     to those who have votes and to their representatives; for to be\r\n     enslaved is to have governors whom other men have set over us, and\r\n     to be subject to laws made by the representatives of others,\r\n     without having had representatives of our own to give consent in\r\n     our behalf.\r\n\r\nSuppose I read it with the feminine gender:\r\n\r\n     Women who have no voice or vote in the electing of representatives\r\n     do not enjoy liberty, but are absolutely enslaved to men who have\r\n     votes and to their representatives; for to be enslaved is to have\r\n     governors whom men have set over us, and to be subject to the laws\r\n     made by the representatives of men, without having representatives\r\n     of our own to give consent in our behalf.\r\n\r\nAnd yet one more authority, that of Thomas Paine, than whom not one of\r\nthe Revolutionary patriots more ably vindicated the principles upon\r\nwhich our government is founded:\r\n\r\n     The right of voting for representatives is the primary right by\r\n     which other rights are protected. To take away this right is to\r\n     reduce man to a state of slavery; for slavery consists in being\r\n     subject to the will of another; and he that has not a vote in the\r\n     election of representatives is in this case. The proposal,\r\n     therefore, to disfranchise any class of men is as criminal as the\r\n     proposal to take away property.\r\n\r\nIs anything further needed to prove woman's condition of servitude\r\nsufficient to entitle her to the guarantees of the Fifteenth Amendment?\r\nIs there a man who will not agree with me that to talk of freedom\r\nwithout the ballot is mockery to the women of this republic, precisely\r\nas New England's orator, Wendell Phillips, at the close of the late war\r\ndeclared it to be to the newly emancipated black man? I admit that,\r\nprior to the rebellion, by common consent, the right to enslave, as well\r\nas to disfranchise both native and foreign born persons, was conceded to\r\nthe States. But the one grand principle settled by the war and the\r\nreconstruction legislation, is the supremacy of the national government\r\nto protect the citizens of the United States in their right to freedom\r\nand the elective franchise, against any and every interference on the\r\npart of the several States; and again and again have the American people\r\nasserted the triumph of this principle by their overwhelming majorities\r\nfor Lincoln and Grant.\r\n\r\nThe one issue of the last two presidential elections was whether the\r\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments should be considered the irrevocable\r\nwill of the people; and the decision was that they should be, and that\r\nit is not only the right, but the duty of the national government to\r\nprotect all United States citizens in the full enjoyment and free\r\nexercise of their privileges and immunities against the attempt of any\r\nState to deny or abridge. In this conclusion Republicans and Democrats\r\nalike agree. Senator Frelinghuysen said: \"The heresy of State rights has\r\nbeen completely buried in these amendments, and as amended, the\r\nConstitution confers not only National but State citizenship upon all\r\npersons born or naturalized within our limits.\"\r\n\r\nThe call for the National Republican Convention of 1872 said: \"Equal\r\nsuffrage has been engrafted on the National Constitution; the privileges\r\nand immunities of American citizenship have become a part of the organic\r\nlaw.\" The National Republican platform said: \"Complete liberty and exact\r\nequality in the enjoyment of all civil, political and public rights,\r\nshould be established and maintained throughout the Union by efficient\r\nand appropriate State and Federal legislation.\"\r\n\r\nIf that means anything it is that Congress should pass a law to protect\r\nwomen in their equal political rights, and that the States should enact\r\nlaws making it the duty of inspectors of elections to receive the votes\r\nof women on precisely the same conditions as they do those of men.\r\n\r\nJudge Stanley Matthews, a substantial Ohio Democrat, in his preliminary\r\nspeech at the Cincinnati Liberal Convention, said most emphatically:\r\n\"The constitutional amendments have established the political equality\r\nof all citizens before the law.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Grant, in his message to Congress, March 30, 1870, on the\r\nadoption of the Fifteenth Amendment, said, \"A measure which makes at\r\nonce four millions of people voters, is indeed a measure of greater\r\nimportance than any act of the kind from the foundation of the\r\ngovernment to the present time.\"\r\n\r\nHow could _four_ million negroes be made voters if two million out of\r\nthe four were women?\r\n\r\nThe California Republican platform of 1872 said:\r\n\r\n     Among the many practical and substantial triumphs of the principles\r\n     achieved by the Republican party during the past twelve years, it\r\n     enumerates with pride and pleasure the prohibiting of any State\r\n     from abridging the privileges of any citizen of the republic, the\r\n     declaring the civil and political equality of every citizen, and\r\n     the establishing all these principles in the Federal Constitution,\r\n     by amendments thereto, as the permanent law.\r\n\r\nBenjamin F. Butler, in a recent letter to me, said: \"I do not believe\r\nanybody in Congress doubts that the Constitution authorizes the right of\r\nwomen to vote, precisely as it authorizes trial by jury and many other\r\nlike rights guaranteed to citizens.\"\r\n\r\nIt is upon this just interpretation of the United States Constitution\r\nthat our National Woman Suffrage Association, which celebrates the\r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the woman's rights movement next May in New\r\nYork City, has based all its arguments and action since the passage of\r\nthese amendments. We no longer petition legislature or Congress to give\r\nus the right to vote, but appeal to women everywhere to exercise their\r\ntoo long neglected \"citizen's right.\" We appeal to the inspectors of\r\nelection to receive the votes of all United States citizens, as it is\r\ntheir duty to do. We appeal to United States commissioners and marshals\r\nto arrest, as is their duty, the inspectors who reject the votes of\r\nUnited States citizens, and leave alone those who perform their duties\r\nand accept these votes. We ask the juries to return verdicts of \"not\r\nguilty\" in the cases of law-abiding United States citizens who cast\r\ntheir votes, and inspectors of election who receive and count them.\r\n\r\nWe ask the judges to render unprejudiced opinions of the law, and\r\nwhereever there is room for doubt to give the benefit to the side of\r\nliberty and equal rights for women, remembering that, as Sumner says,\r\n\"The true rule of interpretation under our National Constitution,\r\nespecially since its amendments, is that anything _for_ human rights is\r\nconstitutional, everything _against_ human rights unconstitutional.\" It\r\nis on this line that we propose to fight our battle for the\r\nballot--peaceably but nevertheless persistently--until we achieve\r\ncomplete triumph and all United States citizens, men and women alike,\r\nare recognized as equals in the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV--PAGE 436\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPER COMMENT ON MISS ANTHONY'S TRIAL.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps needless to say that whoever listens candidly to Susan B.\r\nAnthony, no matter how he previously regarded her and her sentiments, is\r\ncertain to respect her and them afterwards.--Geneva Courier.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Susan B. Anthony is sharp enough for a successful politician. She\r\nis under arrest in Rochester for voting illegally, and is conducting her\r\ncase in a way which beats even lawyers. She stumped the county of Monroe\r\nand spoke in every post-office district so powerfully that she has\r\nactually converted nearly the entire male population to the woman\r\nsuffrage doctrine. The sentiment is so universal that the United States\r\ndistrict-attorney dare not trust his case to a jury drawn from that\r\ncounty, and has changed the venue to Ontario. Now Miss Anthony proposes\r\nto stump Ontario immediately, and has procured the services of Matilda\r\nJoslyn Gage, of Fayetteville, to assist her. By the time the case comes\r\non, Miss Anthony will have Ontario county converted to her\r\ndoctrine.--Syracuse Standard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf Miss Anthony has converted every man in Monroe county to her views of\r\nthe suffrage question, as the district-attorney intimates in his recent\r\nefforts to have her case adjourned, it is pretty good evidence--unless\r\nevery man in Monroe county is a fool--that the lady has done no wrong.\r\n\"Her case,\" remarks the Auburn Bulletin, \"will probably be carried over\r\nto another term, and all she has to do is to canvass and convert another\r\ncounty. A shrewd woman that! Again we say she ought to vote.\"--Rochester\r\nDemocrat and Chronicle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is perplexity in the northern district of New York. It was in that\r\njurisdiction that Miss Susan B. Anthony and sundry \"erring sisters\"\r\nvoted at the November election. For this they were arrested and\r\nindicted. The venue was laid in Monroe county and there the trial was to\r\ntake place. Miss Anthony then proceeded to stump Monroe county and every\r\ntown and village thereof, asking her bucolic hearers the solemn\r\nconundrum, \"Is it a crime for a United States citizen to vote?\" The\r\nanswer is supposed generally to be in the negative, and so convincing is\r\nSister Anthony's rhetoric regarded that it is supposed no jury can be\r\nfound to convict her. Her case has gone to the jurymen of Monroe, in her\r\nown persuasive pleadings, before they are summoned. The\r\ndistrict-attorney has, therefore, postponed the trial to another term of\r\nthe court, and changed the place thereof to Ontario county; whereupon\r\nthe brave Susan takes the stump in Ontario, and personally makes known\r\nher woes and wants. It is a regular St. Anthony's dance she leads the\r\ndistrict-attorney; and, in spite of winter cold or summer heat, she\r\nwill carry her case from county to county precisely as fast as the venue\r\nis changed. One must rise very early in the morning to get the start of\r\nthis active apostle of the sisterhood.--New York Commercial Advertiser.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that the decision of the court will be in Miss Anthony's\r\nfavor. If such be the result the advocates of woman suffrage will change\r\nplaces with the public. They will no longer be forced to obtain hearings\r\nfrom congressional and legislative committees for their claims, but will\r\nexercise their right to vote by the authority of a legal precedent\r\nagainst which positive laws forbidding them from voting will be the only\r\nremedy. It is a question whether such laws can be passed in this\r\ncountry. A careful examination of the subject must precede any such\r\nlegislation, and the inference from the result of Judge Selden's\r\ninvestigation is that the more the subject is studied the less likely\r\nwill any legislative body be to forbid those women who want to vote from\r\nso doing.--New York Evening Post.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMiss Susan B. Anthony, whatever else she may be, is evidently of the\r\nright stuff for a reformer. Of all the woman suffragists she has the\r\nmost courage and resource, and fights her own and her sisters' battle\r\nwith the most wonderful energy, resolution and hopefulness. It is well\r\nknown that she is now under indictment for voting illegally in Rochester\r\nlast November. Voting illegally in her case means simply voting, for it\r\nis held that women can not lawfully vote at all. She is to be tried\r\nsoon, but in the meantime, while at large on bail, she has devoted her\r\ntime to missionary work on behalf of woman suffrage, and has spoken, it\r\nis said, in every post-office district in Monroe county, where her trial\r\nwould have been held in the natural course of things. She has argued her\r\ncause so well that almost all the male population of the county have\r\nbeen converted to her views on this subject. The district-attorney is\r\nafraid to trust the case to a jury from that county, and has obtained a\r\nchange of venue to Ontario on the ground that a fair trial can not be\r\nhad in Monroe.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony, rather cheered than discouraged by this unwilling\r\ntestimony to the strength of her cause and her powers of persuasion, has\r\nmade arrangements to canvass Ontario county as thoroughly as Monroe.\r\nSome foolish and bigoted people who edit newspapers are complaining that\r\nMiss Anthony's proceedings are highly improper, inasmuch as they are\r\nintended to influence the decision of a cause pending in the courts.\r\nThey even talk about contempt of court, and declare that Miss Anthony\r\nshould be compelled to desist from making these invidious harangues. We\r\nsuspect that the courts will not venture to interfere with this lady's\r\nspeech-making tour, but will be of the opinion that she has the same\r\nright which other people, male or female, have to explain her political\r\nviews and make converts to them if she can. We have never known it\r\nclaimed before that a person accused of an offense was thereby deprived\r\nof the common right of free speech on political and other\r\nquestions.--Worcester Spy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe vapid efforts of a part of the newspaper press to entertain the\r\npublic, of late, by descriptions, criticisms and comments, founded upon\r\npretended interviews with Miss Anthony, reveal a standard of courtesy\r\nand truth discreditable to the American press, and a meagerness of\r\ninteresting matter suggesting the propriety of the suspension of such\r\nsheets altogether. The Pittsburg Leader, among others, disgraces itself\r\nby a scurrilous report of what \"the gay old girl said to a reporter;\"\r\nand the New York World, of course, waxed very funny in its account of\r\nthe late convention. These gibes at Miss Anthony's personal appearance,\r\nunwillingness to tell her age, \"fishy eyes,\" etc., are read by her\r\nfriends in Rochester with indignation and with contempt for the press\r\nwhich will publish such misrepresentations as truth.\r\n\r\nAll Rochester will assert--at least all of it worth heeding--that Miss\r\nAnthony holds here the position of a refined and estimable woman,\r\nthoroughly respected and beloved by the large circle of staunch friends\r\nwho swear by her common sense and loyalty, if not by her peculiar views.\r\nAs for her age, she tells it often enough unsolicited, whenever the\r\nfamous silk dress is alluded to; the dear old dress that a New York\r\nreporter held up as such perfection of taste and fashion! Anna Dickinson\r\ngave that dress to Miss Anthony upon her fiftieth birthday a number of\r\nyears ago, and the news was in all the papers. That dress is going into\r\nhistory with Commissioner Storrs, Judge Selden and the illustrious rest.\r\nIt has always been worn by a lady--a genuine lady--no pretense nor\r\nsham--but good Quaker metal. She is no \"sour old maid,\" our Miss\r\nAnthony, nor are the young men shy of her when she can find time to\r\naccept an invitation out; genial, cheery, warm-hearted, overflowing with\r\nstories and reminiscences, utterly fearless and regardless of mere\r\npublic opinion, yet having a woman's delicate sensitiveness as to\r\nanything outre in dress or appearance.\r\n\r\nOur Susan B. Anthony will work up into a charming bit of biography some\r\nday without a dull page within the covers, providing, of course,\r\nstupidity does not have the writing of it. Never mind what she has been\r\nfighting for, and will fight for till the victory is sure, we must all\r\nown hers a brave record, and she has already accomplished for her sex\r\nmuch that their scorn and contumely did not prevent her striving for. We\r\nheard a lady remark after attending the suffrage convention: \"No, I am\r\nnot converted to what these women advocate, I am too cowardly for that;\r\nbut I am converted to Susan B. Anthony.\"--Rochester Evening Express.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII--PAGE 472.\r\n\r\nWOMAN WANTS BREAD, NOT THE BALLOT!\r\n\r\n_Delivered in most of the large cities of the United States, between\r\n1870 and 1880. The speech never was written, and this abstract was\r\nprepared from scattered notes and newspaper reports._\r\n\r\nMy purpose tonight is to demonstrate the great historical fact that\r\ndisfranchisement is not only political degradation, but also moral,\r\nsocial, educational and industrial degradation; and that it does not\r\nmatter whether the disfranchised class live under a monarchial or a\r\nrepublican form of government, or whether it be white workingmen of\r\nEngland, negroes on our southern plantations, serfs of Russia, Chinamen\r\non our Pacific coast, or native born, tax-paying women of this republic.\r\nWherever, on the face of the globe or on the page of history, you show\r\nme a disfranchised class, I will show you a degraded class of labor.\r\nDisfranchisement means inability to make, shape or control one's own\r\ncircumstances. The disfranchised must always do the work, accept the\r\nwages, occupy the position the enfranchised assign to them. The\r\ndisfranchised are in the position of the pauper. You remember the old\r\nadage, \"Beggars must not be choosers;\" they must take what they can get\r\nor nothing! That is exactly the position of women in the world of work\r\ntoday; they can not choose. If they could, do you for a moment believe\r\nthey would take the subordinate places and the inferior pay? Nor is it a\r\n\"new thing under the sun\" for the disfranchised, the inferior classes\r\nweighed down with wrongs, to declare they \"do not want to vote.\" The\r\nrank and file are not philosophers, they are not educated to think for\r\nthemselves, but simply to accept, unquestioned, whatever comes.\r\n\r\nYears ago in England when the workingmen, starving in the mines and\r\nfactories, gathered in mobs and took bread wherever they could get it,\r\ntheir friends tried to educate them into a knowledge of the causes of\r\ntheir poverty and degradation. At one of these \"monster bread meetings,\"\r\nheld in Manchester, John Bright said to them, \"Workingmen, what you need\r\nto bring to you cheap bread and plenty of it, is the franchise;\" but\r\nthose ignorant men shouted back to Mr. Bright, precisely as the women of\r\nAmerica do to us today, \"It is not the vote we want, it is bread;\" and\r\nthey broke up the meeting, refusing to allow him, their best friend, to\r\nexplain to them the powers of the franchise. The condition of those\r\nworkingmen was very little above that of slavery. Some of you may\r\nremember when George Thompson came over to this country and rebuked us\r\nfor our crime and our curse of slavery, how the slaveholders and their\r\nabettors shouted back to Mr. Thompson, \"Look at home, look into your\r\nmines and your factories, you have slavery in England.\"\r\n\r\nYou recollect a book published at that time entitled, \"The Glory and\r\nShame of England.\" Her glory was the emancipation of slaves in the\r\nBritish West Indies, and her shame the degraded and outraged condition\r\nof those very miners and factory men. In their desperation, they\r\norganized trades unions, went on strike, fought terrible battles, often\r\ndestroying property and sometimes even killing their employers. Those\r\nwho have read Charles Reade's novel, \"Put Yourself in his Place,\" have\r\nnot forgotten the terrible scenes depicted. While those starving men\r\nsometimes bettered their condition financially, they never made a ripple\r\non the surface of political thought. No member ever championed their\r\ncause on the floor of Parliament. If spoken of at all, it was as our\r\npoliticians used to speak of the negroes before the war, or as they\r\nspeak of the Chinese today--as nuisances that ought to be suppressed.\r\n\r\nBut at length, through the persistent demands of a little handful of\r\nreformers, there was introduced into the British Parliament the\r\n\"household suffrage\" bill of 1867. John Stuart Mill not only championed\r\nthat bill as it was presented, but moved an amendment to strike out the\r\nword \"man\" and substitute therefor the word \"person,\" so that the bill\r\nshould read, \"every person who shall pay a seven-pound rental per annum\r\nshall be entitled to the franchise.\" You will see that Mr. Mill's motive\r\nwas to extend the suffrage to women as well as men. But when the vote\r\nwas taken, only seventy-four, out of the nearly seven hundred members of\r\nthe British Parliament, voted in its favor.\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion of the original bill, the opposition was\r\nchampioned by Robert Lowe, who presented all the stock objections to the\r\nextension of the franchise to \"those ignorant, degraded workingmen,\" as\r\nhe called them, that ever were presented in this country against giving\r\nthe ballot to the negroes, and that are today being urged against the\r\nenfranchisement of women. Is it not a little remarkable that no matter\r\nwho the class may be that it is proposed to enfranchise, the objections\r\nare always the same? \"The ballot in the hands of this new class will\r\nmake their condition worse than before, and the introduction of this new\r\nclass into the political arena will degrade politics to a lower level.\"\r\nBut notwithstanding Mr. Lowe's persistent opposition, the bill became a\r\nlaw; and before the session closed, that same individual moved that\r\nParliament, having enfranchised these men, should now make an\r\nappropriation for the establishment and support of schools for the\r\neducation of them and their sons. Now, mark you his reason why! \"Unless\r\nthey are educated,\" said he, \"they will be the means of overturning the\r\nthrone of England.\" So long as these poor men in the mines and factories\r\nhad not the right to vote, the power to make and unmake the laws and\r\nlaw-makers, to help or hurt the government, no measure ever had been\r\nproposed for their benefit although they were ground under the heel of\r\nthe capitalist to a condition of abject slavery. But the moment this\r\npower is placed in their hands, before they have used it even once, this\r\nbitterest enemy to their possessing it is the first man to spring to his\r\nfeet and make this motion for the most beneficent measure possible in\r\ntheir behalf--public schools for the education of themselves and their\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nFrom that day to this, there never has been a session of the British\r\nParliament that has not had before it some measure for the benefit of\r\nthe working classes. Parliament has enacted laws compelling employers\r\nto cut down the number of hours for a day's work, to pay better wages,\r\nto build decent houses for their employes, and has prohibited the\r\nemployment of very young children in the mines and factories. The\r\nhistory of those olden times records that not infrequently children were\r\nborn in the mines and passed their lives there, scarcely seeing the\r\nsunlight from the day of their birth to the day of their death.\r\n\r\nSad as is the condition of the workingmen of England today, it is\r\ninfinitely better than it was twenty years ago. At first the votes of\r\nthe workingmen were given to the Liberal party, because it was the\r\nleaders of that party who secured their enfranchisement; but soon the\r\nleaders of the Conservative party, seeing the power the workingmen had,\r\nbegan to vie with the Liberals by going into their meetings and pledging\r\nthat if they would vote the Tory ticket and bring that party into\r\ncontrol, it would give them more and better laws even than the Liberals.\r\nIn 1874 enough workingmen did go over to bring that party to the front,\r\nwith Disraeli at its head, where it stood till 1880 when the rank and\r\nfile of the workingmen of England, dissatisfied with Disraeli's policy,\r\nboth domestic and foreign, turned and again voted the Liberal ticket,\r\nputting that party in power with Gladstone as its leader. This is the\r\nway in which the ballot in the hands of the masses of wage-earners, even\r\nunder a monarchial form of government, makes of them a tremendous\r\nbalance of power whose wants and wishes the instinct of self-interest\r\ncompels the political leaders to study and obey.\r\n\r\nThe great distinctive advantage possessed by the workingmen of this\r\nrepublic is that the son of the humblest citizen, black or white, has\r\nequal chances with the son of the richest in the land if he take\r\nadvantage of the public schools, the colleges and the many opportunities\r\nfreely offered. It is this equality of rights which makes our nation a\r\nhome for the oppressed of all the monarchies of the old world.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, notwithstanding the declaration of our Revolutionary fathers,\r\n\"all men created equal,\" \"governments derive their just powers from\r\nthe consent of the governed,\" \"taxation and representation\r\ninseparable\"--notwithstanding all these grand enunciations, our\r\ngovernment was founded upon the blood and bones of half a million human\r\nbeings, bought and sold as chattels in the market. Nearly all the\r\noriginal thirteen States had property qualifications which disfranchised\r\npoor white men as well as women and negroes. Thomas Jefferson, at the\r\nhead of the old Democratic party, took the lead in advocating the\r\nremoval of all property qualifications, as so many violations of the\r\nfundamental principle of our government--\"the right of consent.\" In New\r\nYork the qualification was $250. Martin Van Buren, the chief of the\r\nDemocracy, was a member of the Constitutional Convention held in Buffalo\r\nin 1821, which wiped out that qualification so far as white men were\r\nconcerned. He declared, \"The poor man has as good a right to a voice in\r\nthe government as the rich man, and a vastly greater need to possess it\r\nas a means of protection to himself and his family.\" It was because the\r\nDemocrats enfranchised poor white men, both native and foreign, that\r\nthat strong old party held absolute sway in this country for almost\r\nforty years, with only now and then a one-term Whig administration.\r\n\r\nIn those olden days Horace Greeley, at the head of the Whig party and\r\nhis glorious New York Tribune, used to write long editorials showing the\r\nworkingmen that they had a mistaken idea about the Democratic party;\r\nthat it was not so much the friend of the poor man as was the Whig, and\r\nif they would but vote the Whig ticket and put that party in power, they\r\nwould find that it would give them better laws than the Democrats had\r\ndone. At length, after many, many years of such education and\r\npersuasion, the workingmen's vote, native and foreign, was divided, and\r\nin 1860 there came to the front a new party which, though not called\r\nWhig, was largely made up of the old Whig elements. In its turn this new\r\nparty enfranchised another degraded class of labor. Because the\r\nRepublicans gave the ballot to negroes, they have been allied to that\r\nparty and have held it solid in power from the ratification of the\r\nFifteenth Amendment, in 1870, to the present day. Until the Democrats\r\nconvince them that they will do more and better for them than the\r\nRepublicans are doing, there will be no appreciable division of the\r\nnegro vote.\r\n\r\nThe vast numbers of wage-earning men coming from Europe to this country,\r\nwhere manhood suffrage prevails with no limitations, find themselves\r\ninvested at once with immense political power. They organize their\r\ntrades unions, but not being able to use the franchise intelligently,\r\nthey continue to strike and to fight their battles with the capitalists\r\njust as they did in the old countries. Neither press nor politicians\r\ndare to condemn these strikes or to demand their suppression because the\r\nworkingmen hold the balance of power and can use it for the success or\r\ndefeat of either party.\r\n\r\n     [Miss Anthony here related various timely instances of strikes\r\n     where force was used to prevent non-union men from taking the\r\n     places of the strikers, and neither the newspapers nor political\r\n     leaders ventured to sustain the officials in the necessary steps to\r\n     preserve law and order, or if they did they were defeated at the\r\n     next election.]\r\n\r\nIt is said women do not need the ballot for their protection because\r\nthey are supported by men. Statistics show that there are 3,000,000\r\nwomen in this nation supporting themselves. In the crowded cities of the\r\nEast they are compelled to work in shops, stores and factories for the\r\nmerest pittance. In New York alone, there are over 50,000 of these women\r\nreceiving less than fifty cents a day. Women wage-earners in different\r\noccupations have organized themselves into trades unions, from time to\r\ntime, and made their strikes to get justice at the hands of their\r\nemployers just as men have done, but I have yet to learn of a successful\r\nstrike of any body of women. The best organized one I ever knew was that\r\nof the collar laundry women of the city of Troy, N. Y., the great\r\nemporium for the manufacture of shirts, collars and cuffs. They formed a\r\ntrades union of several hundred members and demanded an increase of\r\nwages. It was refused. So one May morning in 1867, each woman threw down\r\nher scissors and her needle, her starch-pan and flat-iron, and for three\r\nlong months not one returned to the factories. At the end of that time\r\nthey were literally starved out, and the majority of them were compelled\r\nto go back, but not at their old wages, for their employers cut them\r\ndown to even a lower figure.\r\n\r\nIn the winter following I met the president of this union, a bright\r\nyoung Irish girl, and asked her, \"Do you not think if you had been 500\r\ncarpenters or 500 masons, you would have succeeded?\" \"Certainly,\" she\r\nsaid, and then she told me of 200 bricklayers who had the year before\r\nbeen on strike and gained every point with their employers. \"What could\r\nhave made the difference? Their 200 were but a fraction of that trade,\r\nwhile your 500 absolutely controlled yours.\" Finally she said, \"It was\r\nbecause the editors ridiculed and denounced us.\" \"Did they ridicule and\r\ndenounce the bricklayers?\" \"No.\" \"What did they say about you?\" \"Why,\r\nthat our wages were good enough now, better than those of any other\r\nworkingwomen except teachers; and if we weren't satisfied, we had better\r\ngo and get married.\" \"What then do you think made this difference?\"\r\nAfter studying over the question awhile she concluded, \"It must have\r\nbeen because our employers bribed the editors.\" \"Couldn't the employers\r\nof the bricklayers have bribed the editors?\" She had never thought of\r\nthat. Most people never do think; they see one thing totally unlike\r\nanother, but the person who stops to inquire into the cause that\r\nproduces the one or the other is the exception. So this young Irish girl\r\nwas simply not an exception, but followed the general rule of people,\r\nwhether men or women; she hadn't thought. In the case of the\r\nbricklayers, no editor, either Democrat or Republican, would have\r\naccepted the proffer of a bribe, because he would have known that if he\r\ndenounced or ridiculed those men, not only they but all the trades union\r\nmen of the city at the next election would vote solidly against the\r\nnominees advocated by that editor. If those collar laundry women had\r\nbeen voters, they would have held, in that little city of Troy, the\r\n\"balance of political power\" and the editor or the politician who\r\nignored or insulted them would have turned that balance over to the\r\nopposing party.\r\n\r\nMy friends, the condition of those collar laundry women but represents\r\nthe utter helplessness of disfranchisement. The question with you, as\r\nmen, is not whether you want your wives and daughters to vote, nor with\r\nyou, as women, whether you yourselves want to vote; but whether you will\r\nhelp to put this power of the ballot into the hands of the 3,000,000\r\nwage-earning women, so that they may be able to compel politicians to\r\nlegislate in their favor and employers to grant them justice.\r\n\r\nThe law of capital is to extort the greatest amount of work for the\r\nleast amount of money; the rule of labor is to do the smallest amount of\r\nwork for the largest amount of money. Hence there is, and in the nature\r\nof things must continue to be, antagonism between the two classes;\r\ntherefore, neither should be left wholly at the mercy of the other.\r\n\r\nIt was cruel, under the old regime, to give rich men the right to rule\r\npoor men. It was wicked to allow white men absolute power over black\r\nmen. It is vastly more cruel, more wicked to give to all men--rich and\r\npoor, white and black, native and foreign, educated and ignorant,\r\nvirtuous and vicious--this absolute control over women. Men talk of the\r\ninjustice of monopolies. There never was, there never can be, a monopoly\r\nso fraught with injustice, tyranny and degradation as this monopoly of\r\nsex, of all men over all women. Therefore I not only agree with Abraham\r\nLincoln that, \"No man is good enough to govern another man without his\r\nconsent;\" but I say also that no man is good enough to govern a woman\r\nwithout her consent, and still further, that all men combined in\r\ngovernment are not good enough to govern all women without their\r\nconsent. There might have been some plausible excuse for the rich\r\ngoverning the poor, the educated governing the ignorant, the Saxon\r\ngoverning the African; but there can be none for making the husband the\r\nruler of the wife, the brother of the sister, the man of the woman, his\r\npeer in birth, in education, in social position, in all that stands for\r\nthe best and highest in humanity.\r\n\r\nI believe that by nature men are no more unjust than women. If from the\r\nbeginning women had maintained the right to rule not only themselves but\r\nmen also, the latter today doubtless would be occupying the subordinate\r\nplaces with inferior pay in the world of work; women would be holding\r\nthe higher positions with the big salaries; widowers would be doomed to\r\na \"life interest of one-third of the family estate;\" husbands would \"owe\r\nservice\" to their wives, so that every one of you men would be begging\r\nyour good wives, \"Please be so kind as to 'give me' ten cents for a\r\ncigar.\" The principle of self-government can not be violated with\r\nimpunity. The individual's right to it is sacred--regardless of class,\r\ncaste, race, color, sex or any other accident or incident of birth. What\r\nwe ask is that you shall cease to imagine that women are outside this\r\nlaw, and that you shall come into the knowledge that disfranchisement\r\nmeans the same degradation to your daughters as to your sons.\r\n\r\nGovernments can not afford to ignore the rights of those holding the\r\nballot, who make and unmake every law and law-maker. It is not because\r\nthe members of Congress are tyrants that women receive only half pay and\r\nare admitted only to inferior positions in the departments. It is simply\r\nin obedience to a law of political economy which makes it impossible for\r\na government to do as much for the disfranchised as for the\r\nenfranchised. Women are no exception to the general rule. As\r\ndisfranchisement always has degraded men, socially, morally and\r\nindustrially, so today it is disfranchisement that degrades women in the\r\nsame spheres.\r\n\r\nAgain men say it is not votes, but the law of supply and demand which\r\nregulates wages. The law of gravity is that water shall run down hill,\r\nbut when men build a dam across the stream, the force of gravity is\r\nstopped and the water held back. The law of supply and demand regulates\r\nfree and enfranchised labor, but disfranchisement estops its operation.\r\nWhat we ask is the removal of the dam, that women, like men, may reap\r\nthe benefit of the law. Did the law of supply and demand regulate work\r\nand wages in the olden days of slavery? This law can no more reach the\r\ndisfranchised than it did the enslaved. There is scarcely a place where\r\na woman can earn a single dollar without a man's consent.\r\n\r\nThere are many women equally well qualified with men for principals and\r\nsuperintendents of schools, and yet, while three-fourths of the teachers\r\nare women, nearly all of them are relegated to subordinate positions on\r\nhalf or at most two-thirds the salaries paid to men. The law of supply\r\nand demand is ignored, and that of sex alone settles the question. If a\r\nbusiness man should advertise for a book-keeper and ten young men,\r\nequally well qualified, should present themselves and, after looking\r\nthem over, he should say, \"To you who have red hair, we will pay full\r\nwages, while to you with black hair we will pay half the regular price;\"\r\nthat would not be a more flagrant violation of the law of supply and\r\ndemand than is that now perpetrated upon women because of their sex.\r\n\r\nAnd then again you say, \"Capital, not the vote, regulates labor.\"\r\nGranted, for the sake of the argument, that capital does control the\r\nlabor of women, Chinamen and slaves; but no one with eyes to see and\r\nears to hear, will concede for a moment that capital absolutely\r\ndominates the work and wages of the free and enfranchised men of this\r\nrepublic. It is in order to lift the millions of our wage-earning women\r\ninto a position of as much power over their own labor as men possess\r\nthat they should be invested with the franchise. This ought to be done\r\nnot only for the sake of justice to the women, but to the men with whom\r\nthey compete; for, just so long as there is a degraded class of labor in\r\nthe market, it always will be used by the capitalists to checkmate and\r\nundermine the superior classes.\r\n\r\nNow that as a result of the agitation for equality of chances, and\r\nthrough the invention of machinery, there has come a great revolution in\r\nthe world of economics, so that wherever a man may go to earn an honest\r\ndollar a woman may go also, there is no escape from the conclusion that\r\nshe must be clothed with equal power to protect herself. That power is\r\nthe ballot, the symbol of freedom and equality, without which no citizen\r\nis sure of keeping even that which he hath, much less of getting that\r\nwhich he hath not. Women are today the peers of men in education, in the\r\narts and sciences, in the industries and professions, and there is no\r\nescape from the conclusion that the next step must be to make them the\r\npeers of men in the government--city, State and national--to give them\r\nan equal voice in the framing, interpreting and administering of the\r\ncodes and constitutions.\r\n\r\nWe recognize that the ballot is a two-edged, nay, a many-edged sword,\r\nwhich may be made to cut in every direction. If wily politicians and\r\nsordid capitalists may wield it for mere party and personal greed; if\r\noppressed wage-earners may invoke it to wring justice from legislators\r\nand extort material advantages from employers; if the lowest and most\r\ndegraded classes of men may use it to open wide the sluice-ways of vice\r\nand crime; if it may be the instrumentality by which the narrow,\r\nselfish, corrupt and corrupting men and measures rule--it is quite as\r\ntrue that noble-minded statesmen, philanthropists and reformers may make\r\nit the weapon with which to reverse the above order of things, as soon\r\nas they can have added to their now small numbers the immensely larger\r\nratio of what men so love to call \"the better half of the people.\" When\r\nwomen vote, they will make a new balance of power that must be weighed\r\nand measured and calculated in its effect upon every social and moral\r\nquestion which goes to the arbitrament of the ballot-box. Who can doubt\r\nthat when the representative women of thought and culture, who are today\r\nthe moral backbone of our nation, sit in counsel with the best men of\r\nthe country, higher conditions will be the result?\r\n\r\nInsurrectionary and revolutionary methods of righting wrongs, imaginary\r\nor real, are pardonable only in the enslaved and disfranchised. The\r\nmoment any class of men possess the ballot, it is their weapon and their\r\nshield. Men with a vote have no valid excuse for resorting to the use of\r\nillegal means to fight their battles. When the masses of wage-earning\r\nmen are educated into a knowledge of their own rights and of their\r\nduties to others, so that they are able to vote intelligently, they can\r\ncarry their measures through the ballot-box and will have no need to\r\nresort to force. But so long as they remain in ignorance and are\r\nmanipulated by the political bosses they will continue to vote against\r\ntheir own interests and turn again to violence to right their wrongs.\r\n\r\nIf men possessing the power of the ballot are driven to desperate means\r\nto gain their ends, what shall be done by disfranchised women? There are\r\ngrave questions of moral, as well as of material interest in which women\r\nare most deeply concerned. Denied the ballot, the legitimate means with\r\nwhich to exert their influence, and, as a rule, being lovers of peace,\r\nthey have recourse to prayers and tears, those potent weapons of women\r\nand children, and, when they fail, must tamely submit to wrong or rise\r\nin rebellion against the powers that be. Women's crusades against\r\nsaloons, brothels and gambling-dens, emptying kegs and bottles into the\r\nstreets, breaking doors and windows and burning houses, all go to prove\r\nthat disfranchisement, the denial of lawful means to gain desired ends,\r\nmay drive even women to violations of law and order. Hence to secure\r\nboth national and \"domestic tranquillity,\" to \"establish justice,\" to\r\ncarry out the spirit of our Constitution, put into the hands of all\r\nwomen, as you have into those of all men, the ballot, that symbol of\r\nperfect equality, that right protective of all other rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII--PAGE 468.\r\n\r\nSOCIAL PURITY.\r\n\r\n_First delivered at Chicago in the Spring of 1875, in the Sunday\r\nafternoon Dime lecture course._\r\n\r\nThough women, as a class, are much less addicted to drunkenness and\r\nlicentiousness than men, it is universally conceded that they are by far\r\nthe greater sufferers from these evils. Compelled by their position in\r\nsociety to depend on men for subsistence, for food, clothes, shelter,\r\nfor every chance even to earn a dollar, they have no way of escape from\r\nthe besotted victims of appetite and passion with whom their lot is\r\ncast. They must endure, if not endorse, these twin vices, embodied, as\r\nthey so often are, in the person of father, brother, husband, son,\r\nemployer. No one can doubt that the sufferings of the sober, virtuous\r\nwoman, in legal subjection to the mastership of a drunken, immoral\r\nhusband and father over herself and children, not only from physical\r\nabuse, but from spiritual shame and humiliation, must be such as the man\r\nhimself can not possibly comprehend.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to harrow your feelings by any attempt at depicting\r\nthe horrible agonies of mind and body that grow out of these monster\r\nsocial evils. They are already but too well known. Scarce a family\r\nthroughout our broad land but has had its peace and happiness marred by\r\none or the other, or both. That these evils exist, we all know; that\r\nsomething must be done, we as well know; that the old methods have\r\nfailed, that man, alone, has proved himself incompetent to eradicate, or\r\neven regulate them, is equally evident. It shall be my endeavor,\r\ntherefore, to prove to you that we must now adopt new measures and bring\r\nto our aid new forces to accomplish the desired end.\r\n\r\nForty years' efforts by men alone to suppress the evil of intemperance\r\ngive us the following appalling figures: 600,000 common drunkards!\r\nWhich, reckoning our population to be 40,000,000, gives us one drunkard\r\nto every seventeen moderate drinking and total-abstinence men. Granting\r\nto each of these 600,000 drunkards a wife and four children, we have\r\n3,000,000 of the women and children of this nation helplessly,\r\nhopelessly bound to this vast army of irresponsible victims of appetite.\r\n\r\n     [Reference was here made to woman's helplessness under the laws.]\r\n\r\nThe roots of the giant evil, intemperance, are not merely moral and\r\nsocial; they extend deep and wide into the financial and political\r\nstructure of the government; and whenever women, or men, shall\r\nintelligently and seriously set themselves about the work of uprooting\r\nthe liquor traffic, they will find something more than tears and prayers\r\nneedful to the task. Financial and political power must be combined\r\nwith moral and social influence, all bound together in one earnest,\r\nenergetic, persistent force.\r\n\r\n     [Statistics given of pauperism, lunacy, idiocy and crime growing\r\n     out of intemperance.]\r\n\r\nThe prosecutions in our courts for breach of promise, divorce, adultery,\r\nbigamy, seduction, rape; the newspaper reports every day of every year\r\nof scandals and outrages, of wife murders and paramour shootings, of\r\nabortions and infanticides, are perpetual reminders of men's incapacity\r\nto cope successfully with this monster evil of society.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of New York show the number of professional prostitutes\r\nin that city to be over twenty thousand. Add to these the thousands and\r\ntens of thousands of Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, New Orleans, St.\r\nLouis, Chicago, San Francisco, and all our cities, great and small, from\r\nocean to ocean, and what a holocaust of the womanhood of this nation is\r\nsacrificed to the insatiate Moloch of lust. And yet more: those myriads\r\nof wretched women, publicly known as prostitutes, constitute but a small\r\nportion of the numbers who actually tread the paths of vice and crime.\r\nFor, as the oft-broken ranks of the vast army of common drunkards are\r\nsteadily filled by the boasted moderate drinkers, so are the ranks of\r\nprofessional prostitution continually replenished by discouraged,\r\nseduced, deserted unfortunates, who can no longer hide the terrible\r\nsecret of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe Albany Law Journal, of December, 1876, says: \"The laws of\r\ninfanticide must be a dead letter in the District of Columbia. According\r\nto the reports of the local officials, the dead bodies of infants,\r\nstill-born and murdered, which have been found during the past year,\r\nscattered over parks and vacant lots in the city of Washington, are to\r\nbe numbered by hundreds.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the Catholics established a Foundling Hospital in New York City.\r\nAt the close of the first six months Sister Irene reported thirteen\r\nhundred little waifs laid in the basket at her door. That meant thirteen\r\nhundred of the daughters of New York, with trembling hands and breaking\r\nhearts, trying to bury their sorrow and their shame from the world's\r\ncruel gaze. That meant thirteen hundred mothers' hopes blighted and\r\nblasted. Thirteen hundred Rachels weeping for their children because\r\nthey were not!\r\n\r\nNor is it womanhood alone that is thus fearfully sacrificed. For every\r\nbetrayed woman, there is always the betrayer, man. For every abandoned\r\nwoman, there is always _one_ abandoned man and oftener many more. It is\r\nestimated that there are 50,000 professional prostitutes in London, and\r\nDr. Ryan calculates that there are 400,000 men in that city directly or\r\nindirectly connected with them, and that this vice causes the city an\r\nannual expenditure of $40,000,000.\r\n\r\nAll attempts to describe the loathsome and contagious disease which it\r\nengenders defy human language. The Rev. Wm. G. Eliot, of St. Louis, says\r\nof it: \"Few know of the terrible nature of the disease in question and\r\nits fearful ravages, not only among the guilty, but the innocent. Since\r\nits first recognized appearance in Europe in the fifteenth century, it\r\nhas been a desolation and a scourge. In its worst forms it is so subtle,\r\nthat its course can with difficulty be traced. It poisons the\r\nconstitution, and may be imparted to others by those who have no outward\r\nor distinguishable marks of it themselves. It may be propagated months\r\nand years after it seems to have been cured. The purity of womanhood and\r\nthe helplessness of infancy afford no certainty of escape.\"\r\n\r\n     [Medical testimony given from cities in Europe.]\r\n\r\nMan's legislative attempts to set back this fearful tide of social\r\ncorruption have proved even more futile and disastrous than have those\r\nfor the suppression of intemperance--as witness the Contagious Diseases\r\nActs of England and the St. Louis experiment. And yet efforts to\r\nestablish similar laws are constantly made in our large cities, New York\r\nand Washington barely escaping last winter.\r\n\r\nTo license certain persons to keep brothels and saloons is but to throw\r\naround them and their traffic the shield of law, and thereby to blunt\r\nthe edge of all moral and social efforts against them. Nevertheless, in\r\nevery large city, brothels are virtually licensed. When \"Maggie Smith\"\r\nis made to appear before the police court at the close of each quarter,\r\nto pay her fine of $10, $25 or $100, as an inmate or a keeper of a\r\nbrothel, and allowed to continue her vocation, so long as she pays her\r\nfine, _that is license_. When a grand jury fails to find cause for\r\nindictment against a well-known keeper of a house of ill-fame, that,\r\ntoo, is _permission_ for her and all of her class to follow their trade,\r\nagainst the statute laws of the State, and that with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe work of woman is not to lessen the severity or the certainty of the\r\npenalty for the violation of the moral law, but to prevent this\r\nviolation by the removal of the causes which lead to it. These causes\r\nare said to be wholly different with the sexes. The acknowledged\r\nincentive to this vice on the part of man is his own abnormal passion;\r\nwhile on the part of woman, in the great majority of cases, it is\r\nconceded to be destitution--absolute want of the necessaries of life.\r\nLecky, the famous historian of European morals, says: \"The statistics of\r\nprostitution show that a great proportion of those women who have fallen\r\ninto it have been impelled by the most extreme poverty, in many\r\ninstances verging on starvation.\" All other conscientious students of\r\nthis terrible problem, on both continents, agree with Mr. Lecky. Hence,\r\nthere is no escape from the conclusion that, while woman's want of bread\r\ninduces her to pursue this vice, man's love of the vice itself leads him\r\ninto it and holds him there. While statistics show no lessening of the\r\npassional demand on the part of man, they reveal a most frightful\r\nincrease of the temptations, the necessities, on the part of woman.\r\n\r\nIn the olden times, when the daughters of the family, as well as the\r\nwife, were occupied with useful and profitable work in the household,\r\ngetting the meals and washing the dishes three times in every day of\r\nevery year, doing the baking, the brewing, the washing and the ironing,\r\nthe whitewashing, the butter and cheese and soap making, the mending and\r\nthe making of clothes for the entire family, the carding, spinning and\r\nweaving of the cloth--when everything to eat, to drink and to wear was\r\nmanufactured in the home, almost no young women \"went out to work.\" But\r\nnow, when nearly all these handicrafts are turned over to men and to\r\nmachinery, tens of thousands, nay, millions, of the women of both\r\nhemispheres are thrust into the world's outer market of work to earn\r\ntheir own subsistence. Society, ever slow to change its conditions,\r\npresents to these millions but few and meager chances. Only the barest\r\nnecessaries, and oftentimes not even those, can be purchased with the\r\nproceeds of the most excessive and exhausting labor.\r\n\r\nHence, the reward of virtue for the homeless, friendless, penniless\r\nwoman is ever a scanty larder, a pinched, patched, faded wardrobe, a\r\ndank basement or rickety garret, with the colder, shabbier scorn and\r\nneglect of the more fortunate of her sex. Nightly, as weary and worn\r\nfrom her day's toil she wends her way through the dark alleys toward her\r\nstill darker abode, where only cold and hunger await her, she sees on\r\nevery side and at every turn the gilded hand of vice and crime\r\noutstretched, beckoning her to food and clothes and shelter; hears the\r\nwhisper in softest accents, \"Come with me and I will give you all the\r\ncomforts, pleasures and luxuries that love and wealth can bestow.\" Since\r\nthe vast multitudes of human beings, women like men, are not born to the\r\ncourage or conscience of the martyr, can we wonder that so many poor\r\ngirls fall, that so many accept material ease and comfort at the expense\r\nof spiritual purity and peace? Should we not wonder, rather, that so\r\nmany escape the sad fate?\r\n\r\nClearly, then, the first step toward solving this problem is to lift\r\nthis vast army of poverty-stricken women who now crowd our cities, above\r\nthe temptation, the necessity, to sell themselves, in marriage or out,\r\nfor bread and shelter. To do that, girls, like boys, must be educated to\r\nsome lucrative employment; women, like men, must have equal chances to\r\nearn a living. If the plea that poverty is the cause of woman's\r\nprostitution be not true, perfect equality of chances to earn honest\r\nbread will demonstrate the falsehood by removing that pretext and\r\nplacing her on the same plane with man. Then, if she is found in the\r\nranks of vice and crime, she will be there for the same reason that man\r\nis and, from an object of pity, she, like him, will become a fit subject\r\nof contempt. From being the party sinned against, she will become an\r\nequal sinner, if not the greater of the two. Women, like men, must not\r\nonly have \"fair play\" in the world of work and self-support, but, like\r\nmen, must be eligible to all the honors and emoluments of society and\r\ngovernment. Marriage, to women as to men, must be a luxury, not a\r\nnecessity; an incident of life, not all of it. And the only possible way\r\nto accomplish this great change is to accord to women equal power in the\r\nmaking, shaping and controlling of the circumstances of life. That\r\nequality of rights and privileges is vested in the ballot, the symbol of\r\npower in a republic. Hence, our first and most urgent demand--that women\r\nshall be protected in the exercise of their inherent, personal,\r\ncitizen's right to a voice in the government, municipal, state,\r\nnational.\r\n\r\nAlexander Hamilton said one hundred years ago, \"Give to a man the right\r\nover my subsistence, and he has power over my whole moral being.\" No one\r\ndoubts the truth of this assertion as between man and man; while, as\r\nbetween man and woman, not only does almost no one believe it, but the\r\nmasses of people deny it. And yet it is the fact of man's possession of\r\nthis right over woman's subsistence which gives to him the power to\r\ndictate to her a moral code vastly higher and purer than the one he\r\nchooses for himself. Not less true is it, that the fact of woman's\r\ndependence on man for her subsistence renders her utterly powerless to\r\nexact from him the same high moral code she chooses for herself.\r\n\r\nOf the 8,000,000 women over twenty-one years of age in the United\r\nStates, 800,000, one out of every ten, are unmarried, and fully one-half\r\nof the entire number, or 4,000,000, support themselves wholly or in part\r\nby the industry of their own hands and brains. All of these, married or\r\nsingle, have to ask man, as an individual, a corporation, or a\r\ngovernment, to grant to them even the privilege of hard work and small\r\npay. The tens of thousands of poor but respectable young girls\r\nsoliciting copying, clerkships, shop work, teaching, must ask of men,\r\nand not seldom receive in response, \"Why work for a living? There are\r\nother ways!\"\r\n\r\nWhoever controls work and wages, controls morals. Therefore, we must\r\nhave women employers, superintendents, committees, legislators; wherever\r\ngirls go to seek the means of subsistence, there must be some woman.\r\nNay, more; we must have women preachers, lawyers, doctors--that wherever\r\nwomen go to seek counsel--spiritual, legal, physical--there, too, they\r\nwill be sure to find the best and noblest of their own sex to minister\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nIndependence is happiness. \"No man should depend upon another; not even\r\nupon his own father. By depend I mean, obey without examination--to the\r\nwill of any one whomsoever.\" This is the conclusion to which Pierre, the\r\nhero of Madame Sand's \"Monsieur Sylvestre,\" arrives, after running away\r\nfrom the uncle who had determined to marry him to a woman he did not\r\nchoose to wed. In freedom he discovers that, though deprived of all the\r\nluxuries to which he had been accustomed, he is happy, and writes his\r\nfriend that \"without having realized it, he had been unhappy all his\r\nlife; had suffered from his dependent condition; that nothing in his\r\nlife, his pleasures, his occupations, had been of his own choice.\" And\r\nis not this the precise condition of what men call the \"better half\" of\r\nthe human family?\r\n\r\nIn one of our western cities I once met a beautiful young woman, a\r\nsuccessful teacher in its public schools, an only daughter who had left\r\nher New England home and all its comforts and luxuries and culture. Her\r\nfather was a member of Congress and could bring to her all the\r\nattractions of Washington society. That young girl said to me, \"The\r\nhappiest moment of my life was when I received into my hand my first\r\nmonth's salary for teaching.\" Not long after, I met her father in\r\nWashington, spoke to him of his noble daughter, and he said: \"Yes, you\r\nwoman's rights people have robbed me of my only child and left the home\r\nof my old age sad and desolate. Would to God that the notion of\r\nsupporting herself had never entered her head!\" Had that same lovely,\r\ncultured, energetic young girl left the love, the luxury, the protection\r\nof that New England home for marriage, instead of self-support; had she\r\ngone out to be the light and joy of a husband's life, instead of her\r\nown; had she but chosen another man, instead of her father, to decide\r\nfor her all her pleasures and occupations; had she but taken another\r\nposition of dependence, instead of one of independence, neither her\r\nfather nor the world would have felt the change one to be condemned....\r\n\r\nFathers should be most particular about the men who visit their\r\ndaughters, and, to further this reform, pure women not only must refuse\r\nto meet intimately and to marry impure men, but, finding themselves\r\ndeceived in their husbands, they must refuse to continue in the\r\nmarriage relation with them. We have had quite enough of the sickly\r\nsentimentalism which counts the woman a heroine and a saint for\r\nremaining the wife of a drunken, immoral husband, incurring the risk of\r\nher own health and poisoning the life-blood of the young beings that\r\nresult from this unholy alliance. Such company as ye keep, such ye are!\r\nmust be the maxim of married, as well as unmarried, women....\r\n\r\n     [Numerous instances cited of the unjust discrimination against\r\n     women where men were equally guilty.]\r\n\r\nSo long as the wife is held innocent in continuing to live with a\r\nlibertine, and every girl whom he inveigles and betrays becomes an\r\noutcast whom no other wife will tolerate in her house, there is, there\r\ncan be, no hope of solving the problem of prostitution. As long\r\nexperience has shown, these poor, homeless girls of the world can not be\r\nrelied on, as a police force, to hold all husbands true to their\r\nmarriage vows. Here and there, they will fail and, where they do, wives\r\nmust make not the girls alone, but their husbands also suffer for their\r\ninfidelity, as husbands never fail to do when their wives weakly or\r\nwickedly yield to the blandishments of other men.\r\n\r\n     [Examples given to prove this point.]\r\n\r\nIn a western city the wives conspired to burn down a house of ill-fame\r\nin which their husbands had placed a half-dozen of the demi-monde. Would\r\nit not have shown much more womanly wisdom and virtue for those legal\r\nwives to have refused to recognize their husbands, instead of wreaking\r\ntheir vengeance on the heads of those wretched women? But how could they\r\nwithout finding themselves, as a result, penniless and homeless? The\r\nperson, the services, the children, the subsistence, of each and every\r\none of those women belonged by law, not to herself, but to her\r\nunfaithful husband.\r\n\r\nNow, why is it that man can hold woman to this high code of morals, like\r\nCæsar's wife--not only pure but above suspicion--and so surely and\r\nseverely punish her for every departure, while she is so helpless, so\r\npowerless to check him in his license, or to extricate herself from his\r\npresence and control? His power grows out of his right over her\r\nsubsistence. Her lack of power grows out of her dependence on him for\r\nher food, her clothes, her shelter.\r\n\r\nMarriage never will cease to be a wholly unequal partnership until the\r\nlaw recognizes the equal ownership in the joint earnings and\r\npossessions. The true relation of the sexes never can be attained until\r\nwoman is free and equal with man. Neither in the making nor executing of\r\nthe laws regulating these relations has woman ever had the slightest\r\nvoice. The statutes for marriage and divorce, for adultery, breach of\r\npromise, seduction, rape, bigamy, abortion, infanticide--all were made\r\nby men. They, alone, decide who are guilty of violating these laws and\r\nwhat shall be their punishment, with judge, jury and advocate all men,\r\nwith no woman's voice heard in our courts, save as accused or witness,\r\nand in many cases the married woman is denied the poor privilege of\r\ntestifying as to her own guilt or innocence of the crime charged against\r\nher.\r\n\r\nSince the days of Moses and the prophets, men and ministers have\r\npreached the law of \"visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the\r\nchildren and the children's children, to the third and fourth\r\ngenerations.\" But with absolute power over woman and all the conditions\r\nof life for the whole 6,000 years, man has proved his utter inability\r\neither to put away his own iniquities, or to cease to hand them down\r\nfrom generation to generation; hence, the only hope of reform is in\r\nsharing this absolute power with some other than himself, and that other\r\nmust be woman. When no longer a subject, but an equal--a free and\r\nindependent sovereign, believing herself created primarily for her own\r\nindividual happiness and development and secondarily for man's,\r\nprecisely as man believes himself created first for his own enjoyment\r\nand second for that of woman--she will constitute herself sole umpire in\r\nthe sacred domain of motherhood. Then, instead of feeling it her\r\nChristian duty to live with a drunken, profligate husband, handing down\r\nto her children his depraved appetites and passions, she will _know_\r\nthat God's curse will be upon her and her children if she flee not from\r\nhim as from a pestilence.\r\n\r\nIt is worse than folly, it is madness, for women to delude themselves\r\nwith the idea that their children will escape the terrible penalty of\r\nthe law. The taint of their birth will surely follow them. For pure\r\nwomen to continue to devote themselves to their man-appointed mission of\r\nvisiting the dark purlieus of society and struggling to reclaim the\r\nmyriads of badly-born human beings swarming there, is as hopeless as\r\nwould be an attempt to ladle the ocean with a teaspoon; as\r\nunphilosophical as was the undertaking of the old American Colonization\r\nSociety, which, with great labor and pains and money, redeemed from\r\nslavery and transported to Liberia annually 400 negroes; or the Fugitive\r\nSlave Societies, which succeeded in running off to Canada, on their\r\n\"under-ground railroads,\" some 40,000 in a whole quarter of a century.\r\nWhile those good men were thus toiling to rescue the 400 or the 40,000\r\nindividual victims of slavery, each day saw hundreds and each year\r\nthousands of human beings born into the terrible condition of\r\nchattelism. All see and admit now what none but the Abolitionists saw\r\nthen, that the only effectual work was the entire overthrow of the\r\nsystem of slavery; the abrogation of the law which sanctioned the right\r\nof property in man.\r\n\r\nIn answer to my proposal to speak in one of the cities of Iowa, an\r\nearnest woman replied, \"It is impossible to get you an audience; all of\r\nour best women are at present engaged in an effort to establish a 'Home\r\nfor the Friendless.' All the churches are calling for the entire time of\r\ntheir members to get up fairs, dinners, concerts, etc., to raise money.\r\nIn fact, even our woman suffragists are losing themselves in devotion to\r\nsome institution.\"\r\n\r\nThus, wherever you go, you find the best women, in and out of the\r\nchurches, all absorbed in establishing or maintaining benevolent or\r\nreform institutions; charitable societies, soup-houses, ragged schools,\r\nindustrial schools, mite societies, mission schools--at home and\r\nabroad--homes and hospitals for the sick, the aged, the friendless, the\r\nfoundling, the fallen; asylums for the orphans, the blind, the deaf and\r\ndumb, the insane, the inebriate, the idiot. The women of this century\r\nare neither idle nor indifferent. They are working with might and main\r\nto mitigate the evils which stare them in the face on every side, but\r\nmuch of their work is without knowledge. It is aimed at the effects, not\r\nthe cause; it is plucking the spoiled fruit; it is lopping off the\r\npoisonous branches of the deadly upas tree, which but makes the root\r\nmore vigorous in sending out new shoots in every direction. A right\r\nunderstanding of physiological law teaches us that the cause must be\r\nremoved; the tree must be girdled; the tap-root must be severed.\r\n\r\nThe tap-root of our social upas lies deep down at the very foundations\r\nof society. It is woman's dependence. It is woman's subjection. Hence,\r\nthe first and only efficient work must be to emancipate woman from her\r\nenslavement. The wife must no longer echo the poet Milton's ideal Eve,\r\nwhen she adoringly said to Adam, \"God, thy law; thou, mine!\" She must\r\nfeel herself accountable to God alone for every act, fearing and obeying\r\nno man, save where his will is in line with her own highest idea of\r\ndivine law.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Howard Mission School, New York, said, \"Miss\r\nAnthony, it is a marvel to me that, with so much brain and common sense,\r\nyou should always devote yourself to mere abstractions. Why is it that\r\nyou never set yourself about some practical work?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the Howard Mission?\" said I. \"How many less children have you now\r\nthan ten years ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no less, but many, many more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be a practical work, then, to make it possible for every\r\nmother to support her own children? That is my aim and my work; while\r\nyours is simply to pick up the poor children, leaving every girl-child\r\nto the mother's heritage of helpless poverty and vice. My aim is to\r\nchange the condition of women to self-help; yours, simply to ameliorate\r\nthe ills that must inevitably grow out of dependence. My work is to\r\nlessen the numbers of the poor; yours, merely to lessen the sufferings\r\nof their tenfold increase.\"\r\n\r\nIf the divine law visits the sins of the fathers upon the children,\r\nequally so does it transmit to them their virtues. Therefore, if it is\r\nthrough woman's ignorant subjection to the tyranny of man's appetites\r\nand passions that the life-current of the race is corrupted, then must\r\nit be through her intelligent emancipation that the race shall be\r\nredeemed from the curse, and her children and children's children rise\r\nup to call her blessed. When the mother of Christ shall be made the true\r\nmodel of womanhood and motherhood, when the office of maternity shall be\r\nheld sacred and the mother shall consecrate herself, as did Mary, to the\r\none idea of bringing forth the Christ-child, then, and not till then,\r\nwill this earth see a new order of men and women, prone to good rather\r\nthan evil.\r\n\r\nI am a full and firm believer in the revelation that it is through woman\r\nthat the race is to be redeemed. And it is because of this faith that I\r\nask for her immediate and unconditional emancipation from all political,\r\nindustrial, social and religious subjection.\r\n\r\n\"What is most needed to ensure the future greatness of the empire?\"\r\ninquired Madame Campan of the great Napoleon. \"Mothers!\" was the terse\r\nand suggestive reply. Ralph Waldo Emerson says, \"Men are what their\r\nmothers made them.\" But I say, to hold mothers responsible for the\r\ncharacter of their sons while you deny them any control over the\r\nsurroundings of their lives, is worse than mockery, it is cruelty!\r\nResponsibilities grow out of rights and powers. Therefore, before\r\nmothers can be held responsible for the vices and crimes, the wholesale\r\ndemoralization of men, they must possess all possible rights and powers\r\nto control the conditions and circumstances of their own and their\r\nchildren's lives.\r\n\r\nA minister of Chicago sums up the infamies of that great metropolis of\r\nthe West as follows: 3,000 licensed dram-shops and myriad patrons; 300\r\ngambling houses and countless frequenters, many of them young men from\r\nthe best families of the city; 79 obscene theatres, with their thousands\r\nof degraded men and boys nightly in attendance; 500 brothels, with their\r\nthousands of poor girls, bodies and souls sacrificed to the 20,000 or\r\n30,000 depraved men--young and old, married and single--who visit them.\r\nWhile all the participants in all these forms of iniquity, victims and\r\nvictimizers alike--the women excepted--may go to the polls on every\r\nelection day and vote for the mayor and members of the common council,\r\nwho will either continue to license these places, or fail to enforce the\r\nlaws which would practically close them--not a single woman in that city\r\nmay record her vote against those wretched blots on civilization. The\r\nprofane, tobacco-chewing, whiskey-drinking, gambling libertines may\r\nvote, but not their virtuous, intelligent, sober, law-abiding wives and\r\nmothers!\r\n\r\nYou remember the petition of 18,000 of the best women of Chicago, a year\r\nago, asking the common council not to repeal the Sunday Liquor Law? Why\r\nwere they treated with ridicule and contempt? Why was their prayer\r\nunheeded? Was it because the honorable gentlemen had no respect for\r\nthose women or their demand? No; on the contrary, many of them,\r\ndoubtless, were men possessed of high regard for women, who would have\r\nbeen glad to aid them in their noble efforts; but the power that placed\r\nthose men in office, the representatives of the saloons, brothels and\r\nobscene shows, crowded the council chamber and its corridors,\r\nthreatening political death to the man who should dare give his voice or\r\nhis vote for the maintenance of that law. Could those 18,000 women, with\r\nthe tens of thousands whom they represented, have gone to the ballot-box\r\nat the next election and voted to re-elect the men who championed their\r\npetition, and defeat those who opposed it, does any one doubt that it\r\nwould have been heeded by the common council?\r\n\r\nAs the fountain can rise no higher than the spring that feeds it, so a\r\nlegislative body will enact or enforce no law above the average\r\nsentiment of the people who created it. Any and every reform work is\r\nsure to lead women to the ballot-box. It is idle for them to hope to\r\nbattle successfully against the monster evils of society until they\r\nshall be armed with weapons equal to those of the enemy--votes and\r\nmoney. Archimedes said, \"Give to me a fulcrum on which to plant my\r\nlever, and I will move the world.\" And I say, give to woman the ballot,\r\nthe political fulcrum, on which to plant her moral lever, and she will\r\nlift the world into a nobler and purer atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTwo great necessities forced this nation to extend justice and equality\r\nto the negro:\r\n\r\nFirst, Military necessity, which compelled the abolition of the crime\r\nand curse of slavery, before the rebellion could be overcome.\r\n\r\nSecond, Political necessity, which required the enfranchisement of the\r\nnewly-freed men, before the work of reconstruction could begin.\r\n\r\nThe third is now pressing, Moral necessity--to emancipate woman, before\r\nSocial Purity, the nation's safeguard, ever can be established.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV--PAGE 642.\r\n\r\nOPEN LETTER TO BENJAMIN HARRISON,\r\n\r\n_Republican Nominee for President._\r\n\r\n                                   INDIANAPOLIS, IND., June 30, 1888.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR: We, representatives of the National Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation, respectfully ask you to consider the following facts:\r\n\r\nThe first plank in the platform adopted by the Republican convention\r\nrecently held in Chicago, entitled \"The Purity of the Ballot,\" reaffirms\r\nthe unswerving devotion of the Republican party to the personal rights\r\nand liberties of citizens in all the States and Territories of the\r\nUnion, and especially to \"the supreme and sovereign right of every\r\nlawful citizen, rich or poor, native or foreign, white or black, to cast\r\none free ballot in public elections and to have that ballot duly\r\ncounted.\" And again the platform says: \"We hold the free and honest\r\npopular ballot, and the just and equal representation of all the people,\r\nto be the foundation of our republican government.\"\r\n\r\nThese declarations place the Republican party in its original attitude\r\nas the defender of the personal freedom and political liberties of all\r\ncitizens of the United States. These sentiments, even the phraseology in\r\nwhich they are here expressed, may be found in every series of\r\nresolutions adopted by the National Woman Suffrage Association since its\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of woman suffrage would have been glad to see the phrase\r\n\"male or female\" inserted after the phrase \"white or black\" in the\r\nresolution above quoted, because this would be a fitting conclusion to\r\nthe enumeration by antithesis of the classes into which citizens are\r\ndivided. However, no enumeration of classes was necessary to explain or\r\nto enforce the declaration of the party's devotion to \"the supreme and\r\nsovereign right of every lawful citizen to cast one free ballot in\r\npublic elections and to have that ballot duly counted.\" It is the\r\nunimpeded exercise of this \"supreme and sovereign right of every lawful\r\ncitizen\" which the women we represent demand.\r\n\r\nThat women are \"lawful citizens\" is undeniable, since the law recognizes\r\nthem as such through the visits of the assessor and tax-gatherer; since\r\nit recognizes them as such in the police stations, the jails, the courts\r\nand the prisons. Only at the ballot-box is the lawful citizenship of\r\nwomen challenged! Only at the ballot-box, which is declared to be the\r\nsole safe-guard of the citizen's liberty--only there is the liberty of\r\nthe female citizen denied.\r\n\r\nBut reverting to the first resolution in the Republican platform, so\r\nsatisfactory in its sentiments, we beg to suggest that its value will\r\ndepend solely upon its interpretation, and that its authoritative\r\ninterpretation must be given by the leaders of the Republican party.\r\nTherefore to you, the chosen head of that party, we address ourselves,\r\nasking that your letter of acceptance of the nomination to the\r\npresidency of the United States be so framed as to indicate clearly your\r\nrecognition of the fact that the Republican party has pledged itself to\r\nprotect _every citizen_ in the free exercise of \"the supreme and\r\nsovereign right\" to vote at public elections.\r\n\r\nIt appears to us that the application of Republican principles which we\r\nseek must be in harmony with your own inherited tendencies. One familiar\r\nwith the history of the English-speaking people, during the last two and\r\na half centuries, with their struggles for conscience, and freedom's\r\nsake, must deem it a matter of course that by this time the sense of\r\nindividual responsibility has become strong even in the hearts of women;\r\nand the descendant of one who in the name of individual liberty stood\r\nwith Cromwell against the \"divine right of kings\" and the tyranny\r\nconsequent upon that obnoxious doctrine, can not be surprised to find\r\nhimself appealed to by his country-women, in that same sacred name, to\r\nstand with the most enlightened portion of his party--with such men as\r\nMorton, Sumner and Lincoln--against the divine right of sex and the\r\npolitical tyranny involved in this doctrine, which in a republic\r\npresents such an anomaly.\r\n\r\nHoping that the question suggested by this appeal will command from you\r\nthe attention which its importance merits, we subscribe ourselves,\r\n\r\n                         Yours with high esteem,\r\n                                    SUSAN B. ANTHONY,\r\n                            _Vice-President-at-Large N. W. S. A._\r\n\r\n                                    MAY WRIGHT SEWALL,\r\n                            _Chairman Executive Committee N. W. S. A._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII--PAGE 785.\r\n\r\nDEMAND FOR PARTY RECOGNITION.\r\n\r\n_Delivered in Kansas City at the opening of the campaign, May 4, 1894._\r\n\r\nI come to you tonight not as a stranger, not as an outsider but, in\r\nspirit and in every sense, as one of you. I have been connected with you\r\nby the ties of relationship for nearly forty years. Twenty-seven years\r\nago I canvassed this entire State of Kansas in your first woman suffrage\r\ncampaign. During the last decade I have made a speaking tour of your\r\ncongressional districts over and over again. Now I come once more to\r\nappeal to you for justice to the women of your State.\r\n\r\nTo preface, I want to say that when the rebellion broke out in this\r\ncountry, we of the woman suffrage movement postponed our meetings, and\r\norganized ourselves into a great National Women's Loyal League with\r\nheadquarters in the city of New York. We sent out thousands of petitions\r\npraying Congress to abolish slavery, as a war measure, and to these\r\npetitions we obtained 365,000 signatures. They were presented by Charles\r\nSumner, that noblest Republican of them all, and it took two stalwart\r\nnegroes to carry them into the Senate chamber. We did our work\r\nfaithfully all those years. Other women scraped lint, made jellies,\r\nministered to sick and suffering soldiers and in every way worked for\r\nthe help of the government in putting down that rebellion. No man, no\r\nRepublican leader, worked more faithfully or loyally than did the women\r\nof this nation in every city and county of the North to aid the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 I made my first visit to Kansas and, on the 2d of July, went by\r\nstage from Leavenworth to Topeka. O, how I remember those first acres\r\nand miles of cornfields I ever had seen; how I remember that ride to\r\nTopeka and from there in an open mail wagon to Ottumwa, where I was one\r\nof the speakers at the Fourth of July celebration. Those were the days,\r\nas you recollect, just after the murder of Lincoln and the accession to\r\nthe presidential chair of Andrew Johnson, who had issued his\r\nproclamation for the reconstruction of Mississippi. So the question of\r\nthe negro's enfranchisement was uppermost in the minds of leading\r\nRepublicans, though no one save Charles Sumner had dared to speak it\r\naloud. In that speech, I clearly stated that the government never would\r\nbe reconstructed, that peace never would reign and justice never be\r\nuppermost until not only the black men were enfranchised but also the\r\nwomen of the entire nation. The men congratulated me upon my speech, the\r\nfirst part of it, every word I said about negro suffrage, but declared\r\nthat I should not have mentioned woman suffrage at so critical an hour.\r\n\r\nA little later the Associated Press dispatch came that motions had been\r\nmade on the floor of the House of Representatives at Washington to\r\ninsert the word \"male\" in the second clause of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment. You remember the first clause, \"All persons born or\r\nnaturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction\r\nthereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they\r\nreside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the\r\nprivileges and immunities of citizens.\" That was magnificent. Every\r\nwoman of us saw that it included the women of the nation as well as\r\nblack men. The second section, as Thaddeus Stevens drew it, said, \"If\r\nany State shall disfranchise any of its citizens on account of color,\r\nall that class shall be counted out of the basis of representation;\" but\r\nat once the enemy asked, \"Do you mean that if any State shall\r\ndisfranchise its negro women, you are going to count all of the black\r\nrace out of the basis of representation?\" And weak-kneed Republicans,\r\nafter having fought such a glorious battle, surrendered; they could not\r\nstand the taunt. Charles Sumner said he wrote over nineteen pages of\r\nfoolscap in order to keep the word \"male\" out of the Constitution; but\r\nhe could not do it so he with the rest subscribed to the amendment: \"If\r\nany State shall disfranchise any of its MALE citizens all of that class\r\nshall be counted out of the basis of representation.\"\r\n\r\nThere was the first great surrender and, in all those years of\r\nreconstruction, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the great leader of our woman\r\nsuffrage movement, declared that because the Republicans were willing to\r\nsacrifice the enfranchisement of the women of the nation they would lose\r\neventually the power to protect the black man in his right to vote. But\r\nthe leaders of the Republican party shouted back to us, \"Keep silence,\r\nthis is the negro's hour.\" Even our glorious Wendell Phillips, who said,\r\n\"To talk to a black man of freedom without the ballot is mockery,\"\r\njoined in the cry, \"This is the negro's hour;\" but we never yielded the\r\npoint that, \"To talk to women of freedom without the ballot is mockery\r\nalso.\" But timidity, cowardice and want of principle carried forward the\r\nreconstruction of the government with the women left out.\r\n\r\nThen came in 1867 the submission by your Kansas legislature of three\r\namendments to your constitution: That all men who had served in the\r\nrebel army should be disfranchised; that all black men should be\r\nenfranchised; and that all women should be enfranchised. The Democrats\r\nheld their State convention and resolved they would have nothing to do\r\nwith that \"modern fanaticism of woman's rights.\" The Germans held a\r\nmeeting in Lawrence, and denounced this \"new-fangled idea.\" The\r\nRepublicans held their State convention and resolved to be \"neutral.\"\r\nAnd they were neutral precisely as England was neutral in the rebellion.\r\nWhile England declared neutrality, she allowed the _Shenandoah_, the\r\n_Alabama_ and other pirate ships to be fitted up in her ports to maraud\r\nthe seas and capture American vessels. The fact was not a single stump\r\nspeaker appointed by the Republican committee advocated the woman\r\nsuffrage amendment and, more than this, all spoke against it.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, we had to make a woman suffrage campaign through the\r\nmonths of September and October. We did our best. Everywhere we had\r\nsplendid audiences and I think we had a larger ratio of men in those\r\nolden times than we have nowadays. Election day came, that 5th day of\r\nNovember, 1867, when 9,070 men voted yes, and over 18,000 voted no. On\r\nthe negro suffrage amendment, 10,500 voted yes and the remainder voted\r\nno. Both amendments were lost. All the political power of the national\r\nand State Republican party was brought to bear to induce every man to\r\nvote for negro suffrage; on the other hand, all the enginery and power\r\nof the Republican, as well as of the Democratic party, were against us;\r\nand many were so ignorant they absolutely believed that to vote for\r\nwoman suffrage was to vote against the negro. It was exactly like\r\ndeclaring here tonight that if every woman in this house should fill her\r\nlungs with oxygen, she would rob all you men of enough to fill yours.\r\nNobody is robbed by letting everybody have equal rights.\r\n\r\nSince 1867 seven other States have submitted the question. Let me run\r\nthem over.\r\n\r\n     [Miss Anthony then gave a graphic description of the campaigns in\r\n     Michigan, 1874; Colorado, 1877; Nebraska, 1882; Oregon, 1884; Rhode\r\n     Island, 1886; Washington, 1889; South Dakota, 1890; all of which\r\n     failed for lack of support from the political platforms, editors\r\n     and speakers.]\r\n\r\nBut at last in Colorado, in the second campaign, we won by the popular\r\nvote, _gained through party endorsement_, the enfranchisement of women.\r\nDuring the summer of 1893 nearly every Republican and Populist and not a\r\nfew Democratic county conventions put approving planks in their\r\nplatforms. When the fall campaign opened every stump orator was\r\nauthorized to speak favorably upon the subject; no man could oppose it\r\nunless he ran counter to the principles laid down in his party platform.\r\nThat made it a truly educational campaign to all the voters of the\r\nState. A word to the wise is sufficient. Let every man who wants the\r\nsuffrage amendment carried, demand a full and hearty endorsement of the\r\nmeasure by his political party, be it Democrat, Republican, Populist or\r\nProhibition, so that Kansas shall win as did her neighbor State,\r\nColorado.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans of Kansas made the Prohibition amendment a party measure\r\nin 1880. After they secured the law they had planks in their platform\r\nfor its enforcement from year to year, until they were tired of fighting\r\nthe liquor dealers, backed by the Democrats in the State and on the\r\nborders. They wearied of being taunted with the fact that they had not\r\nthe power to enforce the law. Then in 1887 they gave municipal suffrage\r\nto women as a sheer party necessity. Just as much as it was a necessity\r\nof the Republicans in reconstruction days to enfranchise the negroes, so\r\nwas it a political necessity in the State of Kansas to enfranchise the\r\nwomen, because they needed a new balance of power to help them elect and\r\nre-elect officers who would enforce the law. Where else could they go to\r\nget that balance? Every man in the State, native and foreign, drunk and\r\nsober, outside of the penitentiary, the idiot and lunatic asylums,\r\nalready had the right to vote. They had nobody left but the women. As a\r\nlast resort the Republicans, by a straight party vote, extended\r\nmunicipal suffrage to women.\r\n\r\nThis political power was put into the hands of the women of this State\r\nby the old Republican party with its magnificent majorities--82,000, you\r\nremember, the last time you bragged. It was before you had the quarrel\r\nand division in the family; it was by that grand old party, solid as it\r\nwas in those bygone days!\r\n\r\nLast year, and two years ago, after the People's party was organized,\r\nwhen their State convention was held, and also when the Republican\r\nconvention was held, each put a plank in its platform declaring that the\r\ntime had come for the submission of a proposition for full suffrage to\r\nwomen. What then could the women infer but that such action meant\r\npolitical help in carrying this amendment? If I had not believed this I\r\nnever would have come to the State and given my voice in twenty-five or\r\nthirty political meetings, reminding the Republicans what a grand and\r\nglorious record they had made, not only in the enfranchisement of the\r\nblack men but in furnishing all the votes on the floor of Congress ever\r\ngiven for women's enfranchisement there, and in extending municipal\r\nsuffrage to the women of Kansas. I have vowed, from the time I began to\r\nsee that woman suffrage could be carried only through party help, that I\r\nnever would lend my influence to either of the two dominant parties that\r\ndid not have a woman suffrage plank in its platform.\r\n\r\nI consider, by every pledge of the past, by the passage of the\r\nresolution through the legislature when the representatives of the two\r\nparties, the People's and Republican, vied with each other to see who\r\nwould give the largest majority, that both promised to make this a party\r\nmeasure and I speak tonight to the two parties as the old Republican\r\nparty. You are not the same men altogether, but you are the descendants,\r\nthe children, of that party; and I am here tonight, and have come all\r\nthe way from my home, to beg you to stand by the principles which have\r\nmade you great and strong, and to finish the work you have so nobly\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans are to have their State convention the 6th of June. I\r\nshall be ashamed if the telegraph wires flash the word over the country,\r\n\"No pledge for the amendment,\" as was flashed from the Republican League\r\nthe other day. Should this happen, as I have heard intimated, and there\r\nis a woman in the State of Kansas who has any affiliation with the\r\nRepublican party, any sympathy with it, who will float its banner after\r\nit shall have thus failed to redeem its pledge, I will disown her; she\r\nis not one of my sort.\r\n\r\nThe Populist convention is to be held the 12th of June. If it should\r\nshirk its responsibility, and not put a strong suffrage plank in its\r\nplatform, pledging itself to use all its educational powers and all its\r\nparty machinery to carry the amendment, then I shall have no respect for\r\nany woman who will speak or work for its success.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats have declared their purpose. They are going to fight us.\r\nWhat does the good Book say? \"He that is not for me is against me.\" We\r\nknow where the Democratic party is, it is against us. If the Republican\r\nand People's parties say nothing for us, they say and do everything\r\nagainst us. No plank will be equivalent to saying to every woman\r\nsuffrage Republican and Populist speaker, \"You must not advocate this\r\namendment, for to do so will lose us the whisky vote, it will lose us\r\nthe foreign vote.\" Hence, no plank means no word for us, and no word for\r\nus means no vote for us. But while no word can be spoken in favor, every\r\ncampaign orator, as in 1867, is free to speak in opposition.\r\n\r\nMen of the Republican party, it comes your time first to choose whom\r\nyou will have for your future constituents, to make up the bone and\r\nsinew of your party; whether you will have the most ignorant foreigners,\r\njust landed on our shores, who have not learned a single principle of\r\nfree government--or the women of your own households; whether you will\r\nlose to-day a few votes of the high license or the low license\r\nRepublicans, foreign or native, black or white, as the case may be, and\r\ngain to yourselves hereafter the votes of the women of the State. These\r\nare the alternatives. It has been stated that you can not have a\r\nsuffrage plank in the Republican platform in Saline county because it\r\nwould lose the votes of the Scandinavians. Will those 1,000 Scandinavian\r\nmen be of more value to the Republicans than will be the votes of their\r\nown wives, mothers, daughters and sisters in all the years to come?\r\n\r\nThe crucial moment is upon you now, and I say unto you, men of both\r\nparties, you will have driven the last nail in the coffin of this\r\namendment and banished all hope of carrying it at the ballot-box if you\r\ndo not incorporate woman suffrage in your platforms. I know what the\r\nparty managers will say, I have talked with and heard from many of them.\r\nI read Mr. Morrill's statement that \"this question should go to the\r\nballot-box on its merits and should not be spoken of in the political\r\nmeetings or made a party measure.\"\r\n\r\nThe masses are rooted and grounded in the old beliefs in the inferiority\r\nand subjection of women, and consider them born merely to help man carry\r\nout his plans and not to have any of their own. Now, friends, because\r\nthis is true, because no man believes in political equality for woman,\r\nexcept he is educated out of every bigotry, every prejudice and every\r\nusage that he was born into, in the family, in the church and in the\r\nstate, so there can be no hope of the rank and file of men voting for\r\nthis amendment, until they are taught the principles of justice and\r\nright; and there is no possibility that these men can be reached, can be\r\neducated, through any other instrumentality than that of the campaign\r\nmeetings and campaign papers of the political parties. Therefore, when\r\nyou say this is not to be a political question, not to be in your\r\nplatform, not to be discussed in your meetings, not to be advocated in\r\nyour papers, you make it impossible for its merits to be brought before\r\nthe voters.\r\n\r\nWho are the men that come to our women's meetings? We have just finished\r\nthe tour of the sixty counties in the State of New York. We had\r\nmagnificent gatherings, composed of people from the farthest townships\r\nin the county, and in many of them from every township, with the largest\r\nopera houses packed, hundreds going away who could not get in. Our\r\naudiences have been five-sixths women, and the one man out of the six,\r\nwho was he? A man who already believed there was but one means of\r\nsalvation for the race or the country, and that was through the\r\npolitical equality of women, making them the peers of men in every\r\ndepartment of life. How are we going to reach the other five-sixths of\r\nthe men who never come to women's meetings? There is no way except\r\nthrough the political rallies which are attended by all men. Now if you\r\nshut out of these the discussion of this question, then I say the fate\r\nof this amendment is sealed.\r\n\r\nEven if it were possible to reach the men through separate meetings,\r\nthe women of Kansas can not carry on a fall campaign. They can not get\r\nthe money to do it unless you men furnish it. Our eastern friends have\r\nalready contributed to the extent of their ability to hold these spring\r\nmeetings, and you very well know that after the husbands shall have paid\r\ntheir party assessments there will be nothing left for them to \"give to\r\ntheir wives\" to defray the expenses of a woman suffrage campaign.\r\nTherefore, no discussion in the regular political meetings means no\r\ndiscussion anywhere. But suppose there were plenty of money, and there\r\ncould be a most thorough fall campaign, what then? Why, the same old\r\nstory of \"women talking to women,\" not one of whom can vote on the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nAgain, with what decency can either of the parties ask women to come to\r\ntheir political meetings to expound Populist or Republican doctrines\r\nafter they have set their heels on the amendment? Do you not see that if\r\nit will lose votes to the parties to have the plank, it will lose votes\r\nto allow women to advocate the amendment on their platforms? And what a\r\nspectacle it would be to see women pleading with men to vote for the one\r\nor the other party, while their tongues were tied on the question of\r\ntheir own right to vote! Heaven and the Republican and Populist State\r\nConventions spare us such a dire humiliation!\r\n\r\nBut should the Republicans refuse to insert the plank on June 6 and the\r\nPopulists put a good solid one in their platform on June 12, what then?\r\nDo you suppose all the women in the State would shout for the\r\nRepublicans and against the Populists? Would they pack the Republican\r\nmeetings, where no word could be spoken for their liberty, and leave the\r\nbenches empty in the Populist meetings where at every one hearty appeals\r\nwere made to vote for woman's enfranchisement? My dear friends, woman\r\nsurely will be able to see that her highest interest, her liberty, her\r\nright to a voice in government, is the great issue of this campaign, and\r\novertops, outweighs, all material questions which are now pending\r\nbetween the parties.\r\n\r\nI know you think your Kansas men are going to vote on this amendment\r\nindependently of party endorsement. You are no more sanguine today than\r\nwere the men and women, myself included, in 1867, that those Free State\r\nmen, who had given up every comfort which human beings prize for the\r\nsake of liberty, who had fought not only through the border ruffian\r\nwarfare but through the four years of the rebellion, would vote freedom\r\nto the heroic women of Kansas. Where would you ever expect to find a\r\nmajority more ready to grant to women equal rights than among those old\r\nFree State men? You have not as glorious a generation of men in Kansas\r\ntoday as you had in 1867. I do not wish to speak disparagingly, but in\r\nthe nature of things there can not be another race of men as brave as\r\nthose. If you had told me then that a majority of those men would have\r\ngone to the ballot-box and voted against equal rights for women, I\r\nshould have defended them with all my power; but they did it, two to\r\none.\r\n\r\nDo you mean to repeat the experiment of 1867? If so, do not put a plank\r\nin your platform; just have a \"still hunt.\" Think of a \"still hunt\" when\r\nit must be necessarily a work of education! My friends, I know enough of\r\nthis State, to feel that it is worth saving. I have given more time and\r\nmoney and effort to Kansas than to any other State in the Union, because\r\nI wanted it to be the first to make its women free. Women of Kansas,\r\nall is lost if you sit down and supinely listen to politicians and\r\ncandidates. Both reckon what they will lose or what they will gain. They\r\nstudy expediency rather than principle. I appeal to you, men and women,\r\nmake the demand imperative: \"The amendment must be endorsed by the\r\nparties and advocated on the platform and in the press.\" Let me propose\r\na resolution:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, From the standpoint of justice, political expediency and\r\n     grateful appreciation of their wise and practical use of school\r\n     suffrage from the organization of the State, and of municipal\r\n     suffrage for the past eight years, we, Republicans and Populists,\r\n     descendants of that grand old party of splendid majorities which\r\n     extended these rights to the women of Kansas, in mass meeting\r\n     assembled do hereby\r\n\r\n     _Resolve_, That we urgently request our delegates in their\r\n     approaching State conventions to endorse the woman suffrage\r\n     amendment in their respective platforms.\r\n\r\n     [The resolution was adopted by a unanimous vote.]\r\n\r\nThat vote fills my soul with joy and hope. Now I want to say to you, my\r\ngood friends, I never would have made a 1,500 mile journey hither to\r\nappeal to the thinking, justice-loving men of Kansas. They already are\r\nconverted, but they are a minority. We have to consider those whose\r\nvotes can be obtained only by that party influence and machinery which\r\npoliticians alone know how to use. This hearty response is a pledge that\r\nyou will demand of your State conventions that the full power of this\r\npolitical machinery shall be used to carry the woman suffrage amendment\r\nto victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.[137]\r\n\r\n  AARON, RABBI, addresses suff. con., 762.\r\n\r\n  ABBE, MRS.
