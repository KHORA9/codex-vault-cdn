Four days later the United States Government sent to Germany a\r\nnote of protest which has come to be known as the \"strict\r\naccountability note.\" After pointing out that a serious infringement\r\nof American rights on the high seas was likely to occur, should\r\nGermany carry out her war-zone decree in the manner she had\r\nproclaimed, it declared:\r\n\r\n     \"If such a deplorable situation should arise, the Imperial\r\n     German Government can readily appreciate that the Government\r\n     of the United States would be constrained to hold the\r\n     Imperial German Government to a strict accountability for\r\n     such acts of their naval authorities and to take any steps\r\n     it might be necessary to take to safeguard American lives\r\n     and property and to secure to American citizens the full\r\n     enjoyment of their acknowledged rights on the high seas.\"\r\n\r\nThe war-zone decree went into effect on Feb. 18. Two days later\r\ndispatches were cabled to Ambassador Page at London and to Ambassador\r\nGerard at Berlin suggesting that a modus vivendi be entered into by\r\nEngland and Germany by which submarine warfare and sowing of mines at\r\nsea might be abandoned if foodstuffs were allowed to reach the German\r\ncivil population under American consular inspection.\r\n\r\nGermany replied to this on March 1, expressing her willingness to act\r\nfavorably on the proposal. The same day the British Government stated\r\nthat because of the war-zone decree of the German Government the\r\nBritish Government must take measures to prevent commodities of all\r\nkinds from reaching or leaving Germany. On March 15 the British\r\nGovernment flatly refused the modus vivendi suggestion.\r\n\r\nOn April 4 Count von Bernstorff, the German Ambassador at Washington,\r\nsubmitted a memorandum to the United States Government regarding\r\nGerman-American trade and the exportation of arms. Mr. Bryan replied\r\nto the memorandum on April 21, insisting that the United States was\r\npreserving her strict status of neutrality according to the accepted\r\nlaws of nations.\r\n\r\nOn May 7 the Cunard steamship Lusitania was sunk by a German submarine\r\nin the war zone as decreed by Germany, and more than 100 American\r\ncitizens perished, with 1,000 other persons on board.\r\n\r\nThereupon, on May 13, the United States transmitted to the German\r\nGovernment a note on the subject of this loss. It said:\r\n\r\n     \"American citizens act within their indisputable rights in\r\n     taking their ships and in traveling wherever their\r\n     legitimate business calls them upon the high seas, and\r\n     exercise those rights in what should be the well justified\r\n     confidence that their lives will not be endangered by acts\r\n     done in clear violation of universally acknowledged\r\n     international obligations, and certainly in the confidence\r\n     that their own Government will sustain them in the exercise\r\n     of their rights.\"\r\n\r\nThis note concluded:\r\n\r\n     \"The Imperial Government will not expect the Government of\r\n     the United States to omit any word or any act necessary to\r\n     the performance of its sacred duty of maintaining the rights\r\n     of the United States and its citizens and of safeguarding\r\n     their free exercise and enjoyment.\"\r\n\r\nGermany replied to this note on May 29. It stated that it had heard\r\nthat the Lusitania was an armed naval ship which had attempted to use\r\nAmerican passengers as a protection, and that, anyway, such passengers\r\nshould not have been present. It added:\r\n\r\n     \"The German commanders are consequently no longer in a\r\n     position to observe the rules of capture otherwise usual and\r\n     with which they invariably complied before this.\"\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing the United States maintained in a note sent to the\r\nGerman Government on June 9 that the Lusitania was not an armed vessel\r\nand that she had sailed in accordance with the laws of the United\r\nStates, and that \"only her actual resistance to capture or refusal to\r\nstop when ordered to do so ... could have afforded the commander of\r\nthe submarine any justification for so much as putting the lives of\r\nthose on board the ship in jeopardy.\"\r\n\r\nIn support of this view the note cited international law and added:\r\n\r\n     \"It is upon this principle of humanity, as well as upon the\r\n     law founded upon this principle, that the United States must\r\n     stand.\"\r\n\r\nExactly one month later, on July 9, came Germany's reply. Its preamble\r\npraised the United States for its humane attitude and said that\r\nGermany was fully in accord therewith. Something, it asserted, should\r\nbe done, for \"the case of the Lusitania shows with horrible clearness\r\nto what jeopardizing of human lives the manner of conducting war\r\nemployed by our adversaries leads,\" and that under certain conditions\r\nwhich it set forth, American ships might have safe passage through the\r\nwar zone, or even some enemy ships flying the American flag. It\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n     \"The Imperial Government, however, confidently hopes the\r\n     American Government will assume to guarantee that these\r\n     vessels have no contraband on board, details of arrangements\r\n     for the unhampered passage of these vessels to be agreed\r\n     upon by the naval authorities of both sides.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to this reply that the note of the United States Government made\r\npublic on July 24 is an answer.\r\n\r\nGermany's reply of July 8 and President Wilson's final rejoinder of\r\nJuly 21--which was given to the American press of July 24--are\r\npresented below, together with accounts of the recent German\r\nsubmarine attacks on the ships Armenian, Anglo-Californian, Normandy,\r\nand Orduna, involving American lives, and an appraisal of the German\r\noperations in the submarine \"war zone\" since February 18, 1915, when\r\nit was proclaimed. Also Austro-Hungary's note of June 29, protesting\r\nagainst American exports of arms, and an account of American and\r\nGerman press opinion on the Lusitania case are treated hereunder.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR AT\r\nBERLIN\r\n\r\nBERLIN, July 8, 1915.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has the honor to make the following reply to his\r\nExcellency Ambassador Gerard to the note of the 10th ultimo re the\r\nimpairment of American interests by the German submarine war:\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Government learned with satisfaction from the note how\r\nearnestly the Government of the United States is concerned in seeing\r\nthe principles of humanity realized in the present war. Also this\r\nappeal finds ready echo in Germany, and the Imperial Government is\r\nquite willing to permit its statements and decisions in the present\r\ncase to be governed by the principles of humanity just as it has done\r\nalways.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Government welcomed with gratitude when the American\r\nGovernment, in the note of May 15, itself recalled that Germany had\r\nalways permitted itself to be governed by the principles of progress\r\nand humanity in dealing with the law of maritime war.\r\n\r\nSince the time when Frederick the Great negotiated with John Adams,\r\nBenjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson the Treaty of Friendship and\r\nCommerce of September 9, 1785, between Prussia and the Republic of the\r\nWest, German and American statesmen have, in fact, always stood\r\ntogether in the struggle for the freedom of the seas and for the\r\nprotection of peaceable trade.\r\n\r\nIn the international proceedings which since have been conducted for\r\nthe regulation of the laws of maritime war, Germany and America have\r\njointly advocated progressive principles, especially the abolishment\r\nof the right of capture at sea and the protection of the interests of\r\nneutrals.\r\n\r\nEven at the beginning of the present war the German Government\r\nimmediately declared its willingness, in response to proposals of the\r\nAmerican Government, to ratify the Declaration of London and thereby\r\nsubject itself in the use of its naval forces to all the restrictions\r\nprovided therein in favor of neutrals.\r\n\r\nGermany likewise has been always tenacious of the principle that war\r\nshould be conducted against the armed and organized forces of an enemy\r\ncountry, but that the enemy civilian population must be spared as far\r\nas possible from the measures of war. The Imperial Government\r\ncherishes the definite hope that some way will be found when peace is\r\nconcluded, or perhaps earlier, to regulate the law of maritime war in\r\na manner guaranteeing the freedom of the seas, and will welcome it\r\nwith gratitude and satisfaction if it can work hand in hand with the\r\nAmerican Government on that occasion.\r\n\r\nIf in the present war the principles which should be the ideal of the\r\nfuture have been traversed more and more, the longer its duration, the\r\nGerman Government has no guilt therein. It is known to the American\r\nGovernment how Germany's adversaries, by completely paralyzing\r\npeaceful traffic between Germany and neutral countries, have aimed\r\nfrom the very beginning and with increasing lack of consideration at\r\nthe destruction not so much of the armed forces as the life of the\r\nGerman nation, repudiating in doing so all the rules of international\r\nlaw and disregarding all rights of neutrals.\r\n\r\nOn November 3, 1914, England declared the North Sea a war area, and by\r\nplanting poorly anchored mines and by the stoppage and capture of\r\nvessels, made passage extremely dangerous and difficult for neutral\r\nshipping, thereby actually blockading neutral coasts and ports\r\ncontrary to all international law. Long before the beginning of\r\nsubmarine war England practically completely intercepted legitimate\r\nneutral navigation to Germany also. Thus Germany was driven to a\r\nsubmarine war on trade.\r\n\r\nOn November 14, 1914, the English Premier declared in the House of\r\nCommons that it was one of England's principal tasks to prevent food\r\nfor the German population from reaching Germany via neutral ports.\r\nSince March 1 England has been taking from neutral ships without\r\nfurther formality all merchandise proceeding to Germany, as well as\r\nall merchandise coming from Germany, even when neutral property. Just\r\nas it was also with the Boers, the German people is now to be given\r\nthe choice of perishing from starvation with its women and children or\r\nof relinquishing its independence.\r\n\r\nWhile our enemies thus loudly and openly proclaimed war without mercy\r\nuntil our utter destruction, we were conducting a war in self-defense\r\nfor our national existence and for the sake of peace of an assured\r\npermanency. We have been obliged to adopt a submarine warfare to meet\r\nthe declared intentions of our enemies and the method of warfare\r\nadopted by them in contravention of international law.\r\n\r\nWith all its efforts in principle to protect neutral life and property\r\nfrom damage as much as possible, the German Government recognized\r\nunreservedly in its memorandum of February 4 that the interests of\r\nneutrals might suffer from the submarine warfare. However, the\r\nAmerican Government will also understand and appreciate that in the\r\nfight for existence, which has been forced upon Germany by its\r\nadversaries and announced by them, it is the sacred duty of the\r\nImperial Government to do all within its power to protect and save the\r\nlives of German subjects. If the Imperial Government were derelict in\r\nthese, its duties, it would be guilty before God and history of the\r\nviolation of those principles of highest humanity which are the\r\nfoundation of every national existence.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Lusitania shows with horrible clearness to what\r\njeopardizing of human lives the manner of conducting war employed by\r\nour adversaries leads. In the most direct contradiction of\r\ninternational law all distinctions between merchantmen and war vessels\r\nhave been obliterated by the order to British merchantmen to arm\r\nthemselves and to ram submarines, and the promise of rewards therefor,\r\nand neutrals who use merchantmen as travelers thereby have been\r\nexposed in an increasing degree to all the dangers of war.\r\n\r\nIf the commander of the German submarine which destroyed the Lusitania\r\nhad caused the crew and passengers to take to the boats before firing\r\na torpedo this would have meant the sure destruction of his own\r\nvessel. After the experiences in sinking much smaller and less\r\nseaworthy vessels it was to be expected that a mighty ship like the\r\nLusitania would remain above water long enough, even after the\r\ntorpedoing, to permit passengers to enter the ship's boats.\r\nCircumstances of a very peculiar kind, especially the presence on\r\nboard of large quantities of highly explosive materials, defeated this\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nIn addition it may be pointed out that if the Lusitania had been\r\nspared, thousands of cases of munitions would have been sent to\r\nGermany's enemies and thereby thousands of German mothers and children\r\nrobbed of breadwinners.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of friendship wherewith the German nation has been\r\nimbued toward the Union (United States) and its inhabitants since the\r\nearliest days of its existence, the Imperial Government will always be\r\nready to do all it can during the present war also to prevent the\r\njeopardizing of lives of American citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Government, therefore, repeats the assurances that\r\nAmerican ships will not be hindered in the prosecution of legitimate\r\nshipping and the lives of American citizens in neutral vessels shall\r\nnot be placed in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nIn order to exclude any unforeseen dangers to American passenger\r\nsteamers, made possible in view of the conduct of maritime war by\r\nGermany's adversaries, German submarines will be instructed to permit\r\nthe free and safe passage of such passenger steamers when made\r\nrecognizable by special markings and notified a reasonable time in\r\nadvance. The Imperial Government, however, confidently hopes that the\r\nAmerican Government will assume to guarantee that these vessels have\r\nno contraband on board, details of arrangements for the unhampered\r\npassage of these vessels to be agreed upon by the naval authorities of\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nIn order to furnish adequate facilities for travel across the\r\nAtlantic for American citizens, the German Government submits for\r\nconsideration a proposal to increase the number of available steamers\r\nby installing in passenger service a reasonable number of neutral\r\nsteamers under the American flag, the exact number to be agreed upon\r\nunder the same condition as the above-mentioned American steamers.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Government believes it can assume that in this manner\r\nadequate facilities for travel across the Atlantic Ocean can be\r\nafforded American citizens. There would, therefore, appear to be no\r\ncompelling necessity for American citizens to travel to Europe in time\r\nof war on ships carrying an enemy flag. In particular the Imperial\r\nGovernment is unable to admit that American citizens can protect an\r\nenemy ship through the mere fact of their presence on board.\r\n\r\nGermany merely followed England's example when she declared part of\r\nthe high seas an area of war. Consequently, accidents suffered by\r\nneutrals on enemy ships in this area of war cannot well be judged\r\ndifferently from accidents to which neutrals are at all times exposed\r\nat the seat of war on land, when they betake themselves into dangerous\r\nlocalities in spite of previous warnings. If, however, it should not\r\nbe possible for the American Government to acquire an adequate number\r\nof neutral passenger steamers, the Imperial Government is prepared to\r\ninterpose no objections to the placing under the American flag by the\r\nAmerican Government of four enemy passenger steamers for passenger\r\ntraffic between North America and England. Assurances of \"free and\r\nsafe\" passage for American passenger steamers would then extend to\r\napply under the identical pro-conditions to these formerly hostile\r\npassenger steamers.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States has declared his readiness, in a\r\nway deserving of thanks, to communicate and suggest proposals to the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain with particular reference to the\r\nalteration of maritime war. The Imperial Government will always be\r\nglad to make use of the good offices of the President, and hopes that\r\nhis efforts in the present case as well as in the direction of the\r\nlofty ideal of the freedom of the seas, will lead to an understanding.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned requests the Ambassador to bring the above to the\r\nknowledge of the American Government, and avails himself of the\r\nopportunity to renew to his Excellency the assurance of his most\r\ndistinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nVON JAGOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Rejoinder\r\n\r\nTHE SECRETARY OF STATE AT WASHINGTON TO THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR AT\r\nBERLIN\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\nWashington, July 21, 1915.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State to Ambassador Gerard:\r\n\r\nYou are instructed to deliver textually the following note to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs:\r\n\r\nThe note of the Imperial German Government, dated the 8th day of July,\r\n1915, has received the careful consideration of the Government of the\r\nUnited States, and it regrets to be obliged to say that it has found\r\nit very unsatisfactory, because it fails to meet the real differences\r\nbetween the two Governments, and indicates no way in which the\r\naccepted principles of law and humanity may be applied in the grave\r\nmatter in controversy, but proposes, on the contrary, arrangements for\r\na partial suspension of those principles which virtually set them\r\naside.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States notes with satisfaction that the\r\nImperial German Government recognizes without reservation the validity\r\nof the principles insisted on in the several communications which this\r\nGovernment has addressed to the Imperial German Government with regard\r\nto its announcement of a war zone and the use of submarines against\r\nmerchantmen on the high seas--the principle that the high seas are\r\nfree, that the character and cargo of a merchantman must first be\r\nascertained before she can lawfully be seized or destroyed, and that\r\nthe lives of noncombatants may in no case be put in jeopardy unless\r\nthe vessel resists or seeks to escape after being summoned to submit\r\nto examination, for a belligerent act of retaliation is per se an act\r\nbeyond the law, and the defense of an act as retaliatory is an\r\nadmission that it is illegal.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is, however, keenly disappointed\r\nto find that the Imperial German Government regards itself as in large\r\ndegree exempt from the obligation to observe these principles, even\r\nwhen neutral vessels are concerned, by what it believes the policy and\r\npractice of the Government of Great Britain to be in the present war\r\nwith regard to neutral commerce. The Imperial German Government will\r\nreadily understand that the Government of the United States cannot\r\ndiscuss the policy of the Government of Great Britain with regard to\r\nneutral trade except with that Government itself, and that it must\r\nregard the conduct of other belligerent governments as irrelevant to\r\nany discussion with the Imperial German Government of what this\r\nGovernment regards as grave and unjustifiable violations of the\r\nrights of American citizens by German naval commanders.\r\n\r\nIllegal and inhuman acts, however justifiable they may be thought to\r\nbe, against an enemy who is believed to have acted in contravention of\r\nlaw and humanity, are manifestly indefensible when they deprive\r\nneutrals of their acknowledged rights, particularly when they violate\r\nthe right to life itself. If a belligerent cannot retaliate against an\r\nenemy without injuring the lives of neutrals, as well as their\r\nproperty, humanity, as well as justice and a due regard for the\r\ndignity of neutral powers, should dictate that the practice be\r\ndiscontinued. If persisted in it would in such circumstances\r\nconstitute an unpardonable offense against the sovereignty of the\r\nneutral nation affected.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is not unmindful of the\r\nextraordinary conditions created by this war or of the radical\r\nalterations of circumstance and method of attack produced by the use\r\nof instrumentalities of naval warfare which the nations of the world\r\ncannot have had in view when the existing rules of international law\r\nwere formulated, and it is ready to make every reasonable allowance\r\nfor these novel and unexpected aspects of war at sea; but it cannot\r\nconsent to abate any essential or fundamental right of its people\r\nbecause of a mere alteration of circumstance. The rights of neutrals\r\nin time of war are based upon principle, not upon expediency, and the\r\nprinciples are immutable. It is the duty and obligation of\r\nbelligerents to find a way to adapt the new circumstances to them.\r\n\r\nThe events of the past two months have clearly indicated that it is\r\npossible and practicable to conduct such submarine operations as have\r\ncharacterized the activity of the Imperial German Navy within the\r\nso-called war zone in substantial accord with the accepted practices\r\nof regulated warfare. The whole world has looked with interest and\r\nincreasing satisfaction at the demonstration of that possibility by\r\nGerman naval commanders. It is manifestly possible, therefore, to lift\r\nthe whole practice of submarine attack above the criticism which it\r\nhas aroused and remove the chief causes of offense.\r\n\r\nIn view of the admission of illegality made by the Imperial Government\r\nwhen it pleaded the right of retaliation in defense of its acts, and\r\nin view of the manifest possibility of conforming to the established\r\nrules of naval warfare, the Government of the United States cannot\r\nbelieve that the Imperial Government will longer refrain from\r\ndisavowing the wanton act of its naval commander in sinking the\r\nLusitania or from offering reparation for the American lives lost, so\r\nfar as reparation can be made for a needless destruction of human life\r\nby an illegal act.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States, while not indifferent to the\r\nfriendly spirit in which it is made, cannot accept the suggestion of\r\nthe Imperial German Government that certain vessels be designated and\r\nagreed upon which shall be free on the seas now illegally proscribed.\r\nThe very agreement would, by implication, subject other vessels to\r\nillegal attack, and would be a curtailment and therefore an\r\nabandonment of the principles for which this Government contends, and\r\nwhich in times of calmer counsels every nation would concede as of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States and the Imperial German Government\r\nare contending for the same great object, have long stood together in\r\nurging the very principles upon which the Government of the United\r\nStates now so solemnly insists. They are both contending for the\r\nfreedom of the seas. The Government of the United States will continue\r\nto contend for that freedom, from whatever quarter violated, without\r\ncompromise and at any cost. It invites the practical co-operation of\r\nthe Imperial German Government at this time, when co-operation may\r\naccomplish most and this great common object be most strikingly and\r\neffectively achieved.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial German Government expresses the hope that this object may\r\nbe in some measure accomplished even before the present war ends. It\r\ncan be. The Government of the United States not only feels obliged to\r\ninsist upon it, by whomsoever violated or ignored, in the protection\r\nof its own citizens, but is also deeply interested in seeing it made\r\npracticable between the belligerents themselves, and holds itself\r\nready at any time to act as the common friend who may be privileged to\r\nsuggest a way.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the very value which this Government sets upon the\r\nlong and unbroken friendship between the people and Government of the\r\nUnited States and the people and Government of the German nation\r\nimpels it to press very solemnly upon the Imperial German Government\r\nthe necessity for a scrupulous observance of neutral rights in this\r\ncritical matter. Friendship itself prompts it to say to the Imperial\r\nGovernment that repetition by the commanders of German naval vessels\r\nof acts in contravention of those rights must be regarded by the\r\nGovernment of the United States, when they affect American citizens,\r\nas deliberately unfriendly.\r\n\r\nLANSING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGerman and American Press Opinion\r\n\r\nON THE GERMAN NOTE OF JULY 8\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German answer to the United States with regard to submarine\r\nwarfare was reported from Berlin on July 10 as having caused the most\r\nintense satisfaction among the Germans and brought relief to them, for\r\nthe mere thought that the submarine war would be abandoned would cause\r\nwidespread resentment.\r\n\r\nThe Berlin newspapers printed long editorials approving the\r\nGovernment's stand and \"conciliatory\" tone. Captain Perseus, in the\r\nTageblatt, said that the \"new note makes clearer that the present\r\ncourse will be continued with the greatest possible consideration for\r\nAmerican interests.\" The note \"stands under the motto, 'On the way to\r\nan understanding,' without, however, failing to emphasize the firm\r\ndetermination that our interests must hold first place,\" in other\r\nwords, that Germany \"cannot surrender the advantages that the use of\r\nthe submarine weapon gives to the German people.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lokal Anzeiger of Berlin commented:\r\n\r\n\"Feeling has undoubtedly cooled down somewhat on the other side of the\r\nwater, and Americans will undoubtedly admit that it is not Germany\r\nthat tries to monopolize the freedom of the seas for itself alone.\r\n\r\n\"In any event, we have now done our utmost and can quietly await what\r\nanswer President Wilson and his advisers will think suitable.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Bernhard in the Vossische Zeitung remarked that the publication\r\nof the note means \"liberation from many of the doubts that have\r\nexcited a large part of the German people in recent weeks. The note\r\n... means unconditional refusal to let any outsider prescribe to us\r\nhow far and with what weapons we may defend ourselves against\r\nEngland's hunger war.\"\r\n\r\nWhat they considered the moderation of the note impressed most Berlin\r\nnewspapers. Thus the Morgen Post said: \"Those who had advised that we\r\nought to humble ourselves before America will be just as disappointed\r\nas those who thought we ought to bring the fist down on the table and\r\nanswer America's representations with a war threat.\"\r\n\r\nCount von Reventlow, radical editor of the Tageszeitung, said: \"The\r\nsubstance of the proposals is to create a situation making it\r\nunnecessary for Americans to travel to Europe on ships under an enemy\r\nflag,\" and the Taegliche Rundschau said that the \"answer with\r\ngratifying decisiveness, guards the conscience of the nation in the\r\nquestion of continuing the submarine war,\" but it criticises the note\r\nfor possibly going too far in making concessions, which \"may prove\r\nimpracticable and result in weakening the submarine war.\"\r\n\r\nThe unfavorable reception of Germany's note in the United States, as\r\nreported through English and French agencies, was read in Berlin with\r\nincredulity.\r\n\r\nThe Kreuz-Zeitung, the Tageszeitung, and the Boersen Zeitung expressed\r\nthe belief that British and French news agencies had purposely\r\nselected unfavorable editorial expressions from the American\r\nnewspapers for the sake of the effect they would have in Great Britain\r\nand France.\r\n\r\n\"Regarding the reception of the German note in America,\" the\r\nKreuz-Zeitung said, \"several additional reports from British sources\r\nare now at hand. Reuter's Telegram Company presents about a dozen\r\nshort sentences from as many American papers. Were these really\r\napproximately a faithful picture of the thought of the American press\r\nas a unit, we should have to discard every hope of a possibility of an\r\nunderstanding. The conception of a great majority of the German people\r\nis that we showed in our note an earnest desire to meet, as far as\r\npossibly justified, American interests.\"\r\n\r\nLike the Berlin press, German-American newspapers were unanimous in\r\npraise of the German note; to the New Yorker Staats-Zeitung it\r\nappeared a \"sincere effort to meet the questions involved\" and as\r\n\"eminently satisfactory.\" The New Yorker Herold thought that any one\r\nwith \"even a spark of impartiality\" would have to admit the \"quiet,\r\nconciliatory tone of the German note\" as \"born of the consciousness in\r\nthe heart of every German that Germany did not want the war\"; that\r\nafter it was forced on her she \"waged it with honorable means.\" The\r\nIllinois Staats-Zeitung of Chicago declared it to be the \"just demand\r\nof Germany\" that Americans should not \"by their presence on hostile\r\nboats try to protect war materials to be delivered by a friendly\r\nnation at a hostile shore.\" From the Cincinnati Freie Presse came the\r\ncomment that Washington \"has no business to procure safety on the\r\nocean for British ships carrying ammunition.\"\r\n\r\nThe American newspapers were nearly unanimous in adverse criticism of\r\nthe note. THE NEW YORK TIMES said that Germany's request was \"to\r\nsuspend the law of nations, the laws of war and of humanity for her\r\nbenefit.\" The Chicago Herald declared that the German answer \"is\r\ndisappointing to all who had hoped that it would clearly open the way\r\nto a continuance of friendly relations.\" While the San Francisco\r\nChronicle discerned in the note \"an entire absence of the belligerent\r\nspirit,\" it found that \"Germany is asking us to abridge certain of our\r\nrights on the high seas.\" To the Denver Post the reply was the\r\n\"extreme of arrogance, selfishness, and obstinacy,\" while The Atlanta\r\n(Ga.) Constitution remarks that German words and German deeds are\r\nseparate matters: \"The all-important fact remains that since President\r\nWilson's first note was transmitted to that country, Germany has given\r\nus no single reasonable cause of complaint.\" The Louisville (Ky.)\r\nCourier-Journal believes the German reply would carry more weight and\r\npersuasion \"if it could be considered wholly and apart as an _ex\r\nparte_ statement.\" \"Without equivocation and with a politeness of\r\noffensively insinuating,\" the Boston Transcript concludes, \"Germany\r\nrejects each and all of our demands and attempts to bargain with\r\nrespect to the future.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE AMERICAN NOTE OF JULY 21\r\n\r\nPublication of the American note in Berlin was delayed until July 25,\r\nowing to difficulty in translating its shades of meaning. While German\r\nstatesmen and editors expressed keen appreciation of its literary\r\nstyle, the press was unanimous in considering the note disappointing,\r\nexpressing pained surprise at the American stand. Captain Perseus,\r\nnaval critic of the Berlin Tageblatt, said that the note \"expresses a\r\ndetermination to rob us of the weapon to which we pin the greatest\r\nhopes in the war on England,\" and indicates that the \"pro-British\r\ntroublemakers have finally won over the President.\" Count von\r\nReventlow in the Tageszeitung complains of the note's \"far too\r\nthreatening and peremptory tone.\" The Kreuz-Zeitung says: \"We are\r\ntrying hard to resist the thought that the United States with its\r\nstandpoint as expressed in the note, aims at supporting England,\" and\r\nGeorg Bernhard of the Vossische Zeitung believes that yielding to\r\nPresident Wilson's argument means \"the weakening of Germany to the\r\nenemy's advantage,\" adding that any one who has this in mind \"is not\r\nneutral, but takes sides against Germany and for her enemies.\" The\r\nBoersen Zeitung says it is compelled to say, with regret, that the\r\nnote is very unsatisfactory and \"one cannot escape feeling that the\r\nshadow of England stands behind it.\" The New Yorker Staats-Zeitung\r\nsays that the note is distinguished for its \"clear language,\" and\r\nquotes the phrase \"deliberately unfriendly\" while noting the demand\r\nfor disavowal and reparation. \"Of quite unusual weight,\" the\r\nStaats-Zeitung says, \"is the hint on the fact that the United States\r\nand Germany, so far as the freedom of the seas is concerned, have the\r\nsame object in view.\" \"Sharp and clear is it also explained\" that\r\nafter the end of the war the United States is \"ready to play the role\r\nof an intermediary, in order to find a practicable way out.\" In fact,\r\nthe note handed to the Government in Berlin \"is at the same time meant\r\nfor London,\" since it expresses itself as determined to protect\r\nneutrals \"against every one of the warring nations.\" The New Yorker\r\nHerold is \"certain that the complications will be settled amicably,\"\r\nwhile the Illinois Staats-Zeitung feels that \"apparently our\r\nGovernment has a secret agreement with England intentionally to\r\nprovoke Germany.\"\r\n\r\nIn praise of this note American press opinion is again nearly\r\nunanimous. The New York World says that \"what the President exacts of\r\nGermany is the minimum that a self-respecting nation can demand.\" The\r\nNew York Tribune calls the note an admirable American document. The\r\nRochester Democrat and Chronicle says it is strongly put, but not too\r\nstrongly, and the Boston Herald thinks there is no escape from its\r\nlogic. The Philadelphia Public Ledger says \"the final word of\r\ndiplomacy has obviously been said,\" and the Administration cannot\r\n\"engage in further debate or yield on any point.\" The Chicago Herald\r\nbelieves the note is couched in terms that \"no intelligent man would\r\nresent from a neighbor whose friendship he values.\" The St. Louis\r\nRepublic says: \"One hundred and twenty-eight years of American history\r\nand tradition speak in President Wilson's vindication.\" The St. Paul\r\nPioneer Press calls the note \"a great American charter of rights,\" and\r\nthe Charleston News and Courier declares that \"we have drawn a line\r\nacross which Germany must not step.\" The Portland Oregonian says: \"If\r\nthere was any expectation that the President's note to Germany would\r\nyield any measure of American rights or descend from the noble and\r\nimpressive determination of the original warning to and demand upon\r\nGermany, it has not been fulfilled.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary's Protest\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch dated London, July 16, says:_\r\n\r\nAccording to an Amsterdam dispatch to Reuter's Telegram Company it is\r\nstated from Vienna that the Austro-Hungarian Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs sent a note to the American Ambassador at Vienna on June 29,\r\ndrawing attention to the fact that commercial business in war material\r\non a great scale is proceeding between the United States and Great\r\nBritain and her Allies, while Austria-Hungary and Germany are\r\ncompletely cut off from the American market.\r\n\r\nIt is set forth in the note that this subject has occupied the\r\nGovernment of the Dual Monarchy from the very beginning, and, although\r\nthe Government is convinced that the American attitude arises from no\r\nother intention than to observe the strictest neutrality and\r\ninternational agreements, yet \"the question arises whether conditions\r\nas they have developed during the course of the war, certainly\r\nindependently of the wish of the American Government, are not of such\r\na kind as in their effect to turn the intentions of the Washington\r\nCabinet in a contrary direction.\r\n\r\n\"If this question is answered in the affirmative, and its affirmation\r\ncannot be doubted,\" according to the opinion of the Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment, \"then the question follows whether it does not seem\r\npossible, or even necessary, that appropriate measures should be taken\r\nto make fully respected the wish of the American Government to remain\r\na strictly impartial vis-a-vis of both belligerent parties.\"\r\n\r\nThe note continues:\r\n\r\n\"A neutral government cannot be allowed to trade in contraband\r\nunhindered, if the trade take the form and dimensions whereby the\r\nneutrality of the country will be endangered. The export of war\r\nmaterial from the United States as a proceeding of the present war is\r\nnot in consonance with the definition of neutrality. The American\r\nGovernment, therefore, is undoubtedly entitled to prohibit the export\r\nof war material.\r\n\r\n\"Regarding the possible objections that American industry is willing\r\nto supply Austria-Hungary and Germany, which, however, is impossible\r\nowing to the war situation, it may be pointed out that the American\r\nGovernment is in a position to redress this state of things. It would\r\nbe quite sufficient to advise the enemies of Austria-Hungary and\r\nGermany that the supply of foodstuffs and war material would be\r\nsuspended if legitimate trade in these articles between Americans and\r\nneutral countries was not permitted.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Austro-Hungarian Government appeals to the United\r\nStates, calling attention to the uninterrupted good relations and\r\nfriendship between that country and the dual monarchy, to take the\r\npresent note under careful consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY AUSTRIA ACTED\r\n\r\n_A dispatch from Vienna, via London, dated July 16, gives the\r\nfollowing information from The Associated Press:_\r\n\r\nFrom a highly authoritative source at the Foreign Office a\r\nrepresentative of The Associated Press has received an explanation of\r\nthe motives that are said to have inspired the dispatch of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian note to the United States regarding the American\r\ntraffic in war munitions.\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian statesman who spoke said that, although the facts\r\nupon which the note was based had been in existence for a long time,\r\nthe communication was sent only now, when, after great victories in\r\nGalicia, it could not be interpreted as a cry for help from a land in\r\ndistress. He disavowed in advance any idea that the note was sent at\r\nthe request or inspiration of Germany, asserting that the step was\r\ntaken spontaneously in the hope that, owing to the undisturbed\r\nfriendly relations between Austria-Hungary and the United States, the\r\nnote would be assured a sympathetic reception in the latter country.\r\n\r\n\"The note,\" said this statesman, \"is inspired by friendly feelings of\r\nthe monarchy toward the Union, where so many of our subjects have\r\nfound a second home. It is the speech of a friend to a friend--an\r\nattitude which we are the more justified in taking because the\r\nrelations of the two states have never been clouded.\r\n\r\n\"It might, perhaps, easily be a source of wonder that, since the basic\r\ngrounds of the note have been in existence for months, the note was\r\nnot sent long ago; but there is a reason for its appearance at this\r\nparticular time. In view of the incredible rumors and reports about\r\nthe condition of the monarchy which have been circulating throughout\r\nthe United States, this note would surely have been interpreted at an\r\nearlier stage of events as a confession of weakness, as an appeal for\r\nhelp in distress. Today, when a rich harvest is being garnered\r\nthroughout the monarchy, when talk of starving out Austria-Hungary\r\ntherefore is rendered idle, when complaints of shortage of ammunition\r\nare heard everywhere else except in the allied central monarchies,\r\nthere cannot be the slightest question of this.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, it might be asked why the note, under these\r\nconditions, was issued at all. With nothing to check the victorious\r\nprogress of the central powers in sight, with their ability to meet\r\npressure in the economic field demonstrated, it might well be thought\r\nthat it is a matter of indifference to them whether America continues\r\nher policy or not. That, however, is not the case. The problems of\r\ninternational law which this war has brought up are of far-reaching\r\nimportance. The solutions reached will be standards of action for\r\ndecades to come.\r\n\r\n\"For eminently practical as well as theoretical reasons, therefore,\r\nthe monarchy is forced now not only to concern itself with the\r\nquestions of the day, but also to feel its responsibility toward the\r\nfuture interests of mankind; and for this reason the Government\r\nthought it necessary to approach the subject under discussion--the\r\nmore so because it felt that the previous debate pro and con had not,\r\nas it wished, led to the desired result, and because it believed that\r\nnumbers of arguments specially laid down in The Hague Convention\r\nhitherto had escaped consideration.\r\n\r\n\"It may, of course, be assumed that the note is a product of mature\r\nconsideration, and was drafted after consultation with international\r\nlaw experts of the first rank. The absence of the slightest hostile\r\nintent in it against the Union is shown not only by the opening\r\nphrases, but by the fact that it was published only after it leaked\r\nout in the United States that there was no objection to its\r\npublication.\r\n\r\n\"The question of whether Austria-Hungary feels that she is being cut\r\noff by America may be answered unreservedly in the affirmative. The\r\nmilitary monarchy can and will continue the war as long as necessary.\r\nThe population will, as hitherto, suffer neither starvation nor\r\nmaterial want. But there are other interests than those connected\r\nprimarily with war which every Government is bound to consider, and\r\nunhampered trade relations with the United States are of the greatest\r\nimportance to us.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, not only material, also I might say sentimental, interests\r\nplay a certain role not to be underestimated among the people. Many\r\nwarm friends of America among us are painfully affected by the fact\r\nthat actual conditions give the impression that America, even though\r\nunintentionally, differentiates between the belligerents.\r\n\r\n\"Austro-Hungarian statesmen, conscious of the great role that America\r\nwill be called upon to play in the future, would forget their duty if\r\nthey neglected to do everything in their power to clear away the\r\ncircumstances that shake the confidence of the bravely fighting armies\r\nand the whole population in the justice of America. It is clear that\r\nthe war would have been ended long ago if America had not supplied our\r\nenemies with the means of continuing it.\r\n\r\n\"The assumption that the Austro-Hungarian note was sent at the wish of\r\nthe German Government is incorrect. On the contrary, it is a\r\ncompletely spontaneous demonstration, inspired wholly by the\r\nAustro-Hungarian considerations. We hope it will be received and\r\njudged in America in the same spirit in which it was sent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. WOOLSEY'S OPINION\r\n\r\n_Theodore S. Woolsey, formerly Professor of International Law at Yale\r\nUniversity, in Leslie's Weekly, for July 29, has an article entitled\r\n\"The Case for the Munitions Trade.\" In part Professor Woolsey says:_\r\n\r\nIn the midst of widespread industrial depression came a great war.\r\nThis war intensified the depression. It cut off markets, raised\r\nfreights, retarded payments, upset the whole commercial world and we\r\nsuffered with the rest. Then shortly came a demand for certain\r\nproducts and certain manufactures caused by the war itself, varied,\r\nconsiderable, even unexpected. This demand grew until it became an\r\nappreciable factor in our industrial life, a welcome source of profit\r\nwhen so many other sources of profit were cut off. It was a good\r\nthing; at the same time it was a temporary, unnatural thing, and\r\ndirectly or indirectly it was based upon the desire of some of our\r\nfriends to kill others of our friends. Accordingly people began to\r\ngive this trade bad names. They called it unneutral, wrong, inhuman.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of our pockets we were adding to the sum of human\r\nsuffering and slaughter, and they urged that, even if legally\r\njustified, ethically this trade was a blot upon our character as a\r\nhumane and civilized people and must be stopped. Where does the truth\r\nlie? What can the munitions trade say for itself?\r\n\r\nNaturally, it turns for justification first to the usage of other\r\nwars, to the recognized rules of international law. As expressed in\r\nArticle 7, Convention XIII, of the 1907 Conference at The Hague, the\r\nlaw is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A neutral power is not bound to prevent the export or transit, for\r\nthe use of either belligerent, of arms, ammunitions or, in general, of\r\nanything which could be of use to an army or fleet.\"\r\n\r\nThe next previous article had prohibited a Government from engaging in\r\nthis trade, so that the distinction between what the State and the\r\nindividual may do is made perfectly clear, provided both belligerents\r\nare treated alike. To permit trade in arms with one belligerent and\r\nforbid it with another would be unneutral and illegal.\r\n\r\nWe permit the munitions trade with both belligerents, it is true, and\r\nyet, owing to the chances of war, the right to buy inures to the\r\nadvantage of one only. Does this stamp our conduct as unneutral? Quite\r\nthe contrary. To embargo munitions bought by one because the other\r\nside does not choose to buy would be the unneutral act. Germany\r\ndoesn't buy because she cannot transport.\r\n\r\nShe cannot transport, because she does not care to contest the\r\ncontrol of the sea with her enemies. Have we aught to do with that? To\r\nsupplement her naval inferiority by denying to the Allies the fruits\r\nof their superiority would be equivalent to sharing in the war on the\r\nGerman side. Moreover, to assume and base action upon German naval\r\ninferiority in advance of any general trial of strength would be not\r\nonly illegal, but even an insult to Germany. Notice that no complaints\r\nof our export of munitions have come from the German Government. To\r\nmake such complaint would be to plead the baby act. Rather than risk\r\nher fleet by contesting the control of the sea, thus gaining her share\r\nof munitions imports, Germany has chosen to withdraw it behind\r\nfortifications, thus losing the munitions trade. Probably the decision\r\nis a sound one, but she must accept the results.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the trade seems to come from two classes:\r\n\r\n(1) German sympathizers who seek to minimize the advantage which sea\r\npower gives the Allies.\r\n\r\n(2) Those who are governed by their emotions rather than by reason and\r\nrespect for law. I would call the attention of both these classes to\r\nthe usage, especially to the German usage, in other wars.\r\n\r\nProfessor Gregory, in an interesting article, gives statistics of the\r\nlarge German exports of arms to the British forces in the Boer war\r\nafter the Boer trade had been cut off. In the Russo-Japanese war Krupp\r\nnotoriously supplied both sides. In the Balkan war there was said to\r\nbe competition between Krupp and Creusot in furnishing cannon. No\r\nstate in the nature of things can satisfy its needs in war completely\r\nfrom its own resources. Every belligerent has bought, every neutral\r\nhas allowed its citizens to sell, munitions since modern war began.\r\nEngland sympathized with the South in our civil war, yet sold to the\r\nNorth. She did the same in 1870 to France.\r\n\r\nIf the trade in munitions is to be forbidden, then every state must\r\naccumulate its own supply or greatly enlarge its arms manufacturing\r\ncapacity, both wasteful processes. To say that a moderate trade is\r\nlawful which a big trade is not is like the excuse of the lady who\r\nthought her baby born out of wedlock did not matter because it was\r\nsuch a little one.\r\n\r\nThe critics of the munitions trade must note furthermore that in our\r\nown country that trade cannot be forbidden without explicit\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the Spanish war such legislation was passed, as a war\r\nmeasure, forbidding the export of coal or other war material at the\r\ndiscretion of the President. But by resolution of Congress of March\r\n14, 1912, the 1898 resolution was so amended as to apply to American\r\ncountries only. The reason for this distinction was, of course, to\r\nlimit the danger of such exports of arms to our neighbor states,\r\nparticularly to Mexico, as might endanger our own peace and safety.\r\nThe general right to trade was left undisturbed.\r\n\r\nBut let us argue the question on ethical grounds alone. I can see no\r\ndifference between a peace trade and a war trade from the humanitarian\r\nstandpoint; between arming a neighbor by our exports in preparation\r\nfor war and rearming him during war. In both cases we help him to\r\nkill. Now, if one regards all war as wrong, aid in waging war by trade\r\nin munitions, whether in peace time or war time, should be abhorrent\r\nto one's conscience. A Quaker gun is not only a paradox, but a sinful\r\none.\r\n\r\nMost of us, however, believe that a defensive war, against aggression\r\nthreatening the life and liberties of a nation, is just and right. In\r\nthe present war both parties claim to be fighting in self-defense. We\r\nare not their judge; we must take both at their word; what we owe\r\nboth, ethically, is simply equality of treatment.\r\n\r\nWe help both alike in waging a just war. To do otherwise is to take\r\npart in their war. With the flux and flow of the contest which makes\r\nour trade valuable or worthless now to one side, now to the other,\r\nboth ethically and legally we have nothing to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArmenian, Orduna, and Others\r\n\r\n\r\n_The diplomatic significance of the sinking of the Leyland liner\r\nArmenian on June 28 off the northwest coast of Cornwall is thus dwelt\r\nupon in a Washington dispatch to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES, _dated July 2,\r\n1915:_\r\n\r\nThe lessons to be derived from the destruction of the Leyland liner\r\nArmenian off the English coast are expected to have a most important\r\nbearing upon the diplomatic controversy between Germany and the United\r\nStates over the safety of human life in the submarine warfare.\r\n\r\nIt is believed here that the Armenian affair demonstrates that it is\r\npossible for German submarines of the latest types, when equipped with\r\noutside rapid-fire guns, to comply with the demand of President Wilson\r\nthat the belligerent right of visit and search must be complied with\r\nbefore merchantmen and passenger ships are torpedoed.\r\n\r\nWhatever the facts as to minor detail, the outstanding lesson of the\r\naffair is that a merchantman tried to escape capture and was finally\r\nforced to halt and surrender by a pursuing submarine, and the\r\ndestruction of the liner by torpedo was not attempted until after\r\nthose on board who survived the chase had an opportunity to take to\r\nthe boats. It is evident that if the Armenian's Captain had heeded the\r\nwarning shots of the submarine and halted the steamer he could have\r\nsubmitted to visit and search and in all probability the destruction\r\nof the Armenian could have been effected without loss of life. All\r\ninternational law experts agree that a vessel that refuses to halt\r\nwhen challenged by warning shots from a properly commissioned\r\nbelligerent war vessel proceeds at her own peril.\r\n\r\nIn its broader aspects, the Armenian incident presents the most\r\nimportant lesson that has come out of the German undersea campaign for\r\nconsideration by those engaged in the diplomatic controversy over the\r\nvarious acts of the German submarines--and the lesson is considered\r\nextremely vital in its bearing on the pending negotiations, because,\r\nif it is at all possible for submarines to exercise the right of visit\r\nand search and they actually proceed in accordance with that rule, the\r\nGermans may proceed with their warfare against merchantmen carrying\r\ncontraband without running counter to the expectations of the United\r\nStates Government. Occasional merchantmen may try to escape capture or\r\ndestruction by disregarding warning shots, but that will be their\r\naffair and the responsibility for loss of life due to efforts to elude\r\nsubmarines, and caused during the period of continued efforts to\r\nescape, would not then rest upon the submarines.\r\n\r\nThe effective use of rapid-fire guns mounted on submarines in bona\r\nfide efforts to halt merchant steamers for purpose of visit and search\r\nis the important factor in the situation. A submarine not so equipped\r\nwould find it difficult, if not impossible, to apply the rule of visit\r\nand search. Without the outside guns such a submarine would possess no\r\nother effective weapon than the torpedo. The submarine that carried no\r\nexterior armament could not compel obedience to its mandate for the\r\nmerchant Captain to stop without firing a torpedo and thus risking the\r\ndestruction of life with the sinking of the steamer, and a submarine\r\nwith no outside armament might run the risk, as frequently contended\r\nby the German Admiralty, of bomb attack from the rails of the merchant\r\nsteamer when going alongside of such a vessel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL CARLO CANEVA\r\n\r\nOne of the Most Conspicuous of Italian Military Commanders\r\n\r\n(_Photo from Central News._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.I.M. FRANCIS JOSEPH I.\r\n\r\nLatest Portrait of the Venerable Sovereign of the Austro-Hungarian\r\nEmpire\r\n\r\n(_Photo from Bain._)]\r\n\r\nA submarine like the U-38, which sank the Armenian, carrying one or\r\nmore outside guns, capable of discharging various kinds of shell, from\r\nblank shots to shrapnel, represents an important evolution in the\r\ndevelopment of marine warfare. Such a craft has the equipment to\r\nenable her to visit and search a passing merchantman, and to provide\r\nfor the safe removal of officers, crew or passengers from a challenged\r\nsteamer, before the destruction of the vessel. It is only necessary\r\nfor such a submarine to fire her torpedoes as a last resort for the\r\ndestruction of the steamer. With her exterior guns a submarine like\r\nthe U-38, upon meeting a merchant vessel, may fire one or more warning\r\nshots, as Captain Trickey of the Armenian says the U-38 did.[1] The\r\nraider, he said, fired two warning shots, and when he turned away from\r\nher and put on speed, the submarine's guns opened fire on him with\r\nshrapnel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Captain Trickey, describing the destruction of his\r\nvessel, through which several Americans lost their lives, said on July\r\n1 in Liverpool:\r\n\r\n\"We sighted the submarine about 6.48 o'clock Monday night, June 28,\r\nwhen we were about twenty miles west of Trevose Head, on the northwest\r\ncoast of Cornwall. We were then about four miles away. She drew\r\ncloser. She fired two shots across our bows. I then turned my stern to\r\nher and ran for all I was worth. The submarine shelled us all the\r\ntime, killing several of the crew and cutting away several of our\r\nboats. The boats had already been swung out, and some of the men had\r\ntaken up positions in them ready for the order to lower away. In some\r\ncases the falls were cut by shrapnel, and several of the men fell into\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n\"A stern chase ensued, lasting for about an hour, the German shelling\r\nus unceasingly. My steering gear was cut and knocked out of order. One\r\nshell came through the engine-room skylight, and another knocked the\r\nMarconi house away. Still another shell went down the funnel,\r\ndisabling the stokehole and making it impossible to keep up a full\r\nhead of steam. Thirteen of my crew were lying dead on the deck, and\r\nthe ship was on fire in three places. Then I decided to surrender. It\r\nwas the only thing I could do. By this time the submarine had\r\ndecreased the distance between us to about a mile.\r\n\r\n\"From the moment we surrendered the Germans acted fairly toward us and\r\ngave us ample time to get out of the ship. They even rescued some of\r\nthe men--three, I think--who had previously fallen from the boats and\r\nwere still afloat aided by their lifebelts. When we had got away from\r\nthe ship the submarine fired two torpedoes into her and she sank at\r\n8.07 o'clock. We remained in the boats all night and were picked up\r\nthe next morning by the Belgian steam trawler President Stevens.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANGLO-CALIFORNIAN\r\n\r\n_Like the Armenian, the British merchantman Anglo-Californian refused\r\nto lie-to when signaled by a German submarine on July 2. Her crew of\r\nninety-five included fifty Americans and Canadians. A Queenstown\r\ndispatch of July 5 gave the following account of the action:_\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Californian left Montreal for the British Isles on June 24.\r\nThe submarine was sighted at 8 o'clock last Sunday morning. Captain\r\nParslow ordered full steam ahead and wireless calls for aid were sent\r\nout. The submarine on the surface proved to be a far speedier craft\r\nthan the steamer and rapidly overhauled her, meanwhile deluging her\r\nwith shells. One shot put the wireless apparatus on the\r\nAnglo-Californian out of action. Finding that he could not escape by\r\nrunning for it Captain Parslow devoted his attention to manoeuvring\r\nhis ship so as to prevent the submarine from using torpedoes\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n\"Our Captain was a brave man,\" said one of the narrators. \"He kept at\r\nhis post on the bridge, coolly giving orders as the submarine circled\r\naround us vainly seeking to get a position from which it could give us\r\na death blow with a torpedo. All the while the under-water boat\r\ncontinued to rain, shot and shell upon us, and at times was so close\r\nthat she was able to employ rifle fire effectively.\r\n\r\n\"At last one shell blew the Captain off the bridge, killing him\r\noutright and terribly mutilating him. Just before that he had given\r\norders to launch the boats, but this was very difficult under the\r\nshell fire. Several men were struck down while working at the davits.\r\nUltimately four boats were got overboard and were rowed away until\r\npicked up.\"\r\n\r\nThe son of Captain Parslow, serving as second mate, was standing by\r\nhis father's side when the Captain was killed. The son was knocked\r\ndown by the violence of the explosion. Springing to his feet, he\r\nseized the wheel, and, as ably as his father had done, continued\r\ndodging the submarine. Another shell burst alongside him, shattering\r\none of the spokes of the wheel, but young Parslow retained his post.\r\n\r\nThe wireless SOS calls that had been sent out at the first alarm had\r\nreached those able to give more than passive assistance, however, and\r\nBritish destroyers appeared. On their approach the submarine abandoned\r\nthe attack and submerged. Young Parslow was still at the wheel when\r\nthe destroyers came up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: War zone area showing where the Armenian, (British);\r\nNormandy, (American); Anglo-Californian, (British), and Orduna,\r\n(British) ships were attacked during the month of July.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORMANDY\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch from Liverpool, dated July 13, 1915,\r\nreported:_\r\n\r\nHow an American ship is alleged to have been used as a shield by a\r\nGerman submarine for the sinking of another vessel is related by\r\nmembers of the crew of the American bark Normandy, which has arrived\r\nhere from Gulfport, Miss.\r\n\r\nThe story is that the Normandy was stopped by a German submarine sixty\r\nmiles southwest of Tuskar Rock, off the southeast coast of Ireland,\r\nFriday night. The captain was called aboard the submarine, whence his\r\npapers were examined and found to show that the ship was chartered by\r\nan American firm January 5.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the bark, it was asserted, was allowed to return to\r\nthe Normandy, but under the threat that his ship would be destroyed\r\nunless he stood by and obeyed orders. These orders, it was stated,\r\nwere that he was to act as a shield for the submarine, which lay\r\naround the side of the bark, hiding itself from an approaching vessel.\r\n\r\nThis vessel proved to be the Russian steamer Leo. Presently the\r\nsubmarine submerged and proceeded around the bow of the Normandy, so\r\nthe story went, and ten minutes later the crew of the Normandy saw the\r\nLeo blown up.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five persons were on board, of whom eleven were drowned,\r\nincluding three stewardesses. Those saved included three Americans,\r\nWalter Emery of North Carolina, Harry Clark of Sierra, and Harry\r\nWhitney of Camden, N.J. All these three men when interviewed\r\ncorroborated the above story. They declared that no opportunity was\r\ngiven those on board the Leo for saving lives.\r\n\r\nThe Leo was bound from Philadelphia for Manchester with a general\r\ncargo.\r\n\r\nThe Captain of the Normandy told the survivors that he would have\r\nliked to signal their danger to them, but that he dared not do so,\r\nbecause his uninsured ship would then have been instantly sunk.\r\n\r\n_In a Washington dispatch to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES, _sent July 13,\r\nappeared the following:_\r\n\r\nThe State Department received a short dispatch late this afternoon\r\nfrom Consul General Washington at Liverpool, confirming the report\r\nthat three Americans were among those rescued by the American bark\r\nNormandy at the time of the sinking of the Russian merchant steamer\r\nLeo by a German submarine off the Irish coast Friday night. This is\r\nthe case in which press dispatches asserted that the submarine\r\ncommander forced the Captain of the Normandy to use his bark as a\r\nshield behind which the submarine hid before firing the torpedo which\r\nsank the Leo.\r\n\r\nThe cablegram from Consul General Washington makes no mention of this\r\nphase of the affair, and does not show whether the German submarine\r\ngave any warning to the commander of the Russian merchant ship before\r\nfiring the shot which destroyed the latter vessel. The official\r\nmessage says that the Normandy was stopped by the submarine, that the\r\nNormandy's papers were examined, and that she was allowed to proceed.\r\nThe message added that the Normandy rescued three American citizens\r\nwho were members of the crew of the Leo, and names them as Walter\r\nEmery, seaman, of Swan Quarter, N.C.; Harry Whitney, steward, of\r\nCamden, N.J., and Harry Clark, fireman, of 113 East Fifty-second\r\nStreet, Seattle, Wash.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDUNA\r\n\r\n_This is the official statement of Captain Thomas M. Taylor of the\r\nCunard liner Orduna, concerning the attack made on his vessel by a\r\nGerman submarine off Queenstown, westbound, on the morning of July 9:_\r\n\r\nAt 6.05 A.M., July 9, the lookout man on the after bridge rang the\r\ntelegraph, at the same time pointing his hand downward and out on the\r\nport beam. The third officer was immediately sent aft to inquire what\r\nwas seen. He returned quickly and reported both men had seen a torpedo\r\npass across the stern from port to starboard, only ten feet clear of\r\nthe rudder. In the meantime both the chief officer and myself\r\ndistinctly saw the trail of the torpedo, extending from the stern to\r\nabout 200 yards out on the port beam. About eight minutes afterwards\r\nthe chief officer and I saw the submarine come to the surface about\r\ntwo points on the starboard quarter, a distance of about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile, with five or six men on her deck, getting\r\nher guns ready.\r\n\r\nI immediately ordered all possible steam, altered the course, and\r\nbrought her right astern, when they began shelling us. The first shot\r\nstruck the water abreast of the forecastle on the starboard side,\r\nabout thirty feet off. The second dropped just under the bridge;\r\nthird, abreast of No. 5 hatch, quite close alongside; fourth, under\r\nthe stern, sending up a volume of water forty feet high; fifth and\r\nsixth and last shells all fell short. The firing then ceased, and the\r\nsubmarine was soon left far astern.\r\n\r\nMarconi distress signals were sent out at once. We were thirty-seven\r\nmiles south of Queenstown. I got a reply that assistance would be with\r\nus in an hour, but it was four hours before the small armored yacht\r\nJennette appeared. I account for the torpedo missing the ship to their\r\nmisjudging the speed, allowing fourteen knots instead of sixteen,\r\nwhich we were doing at the time. The torpedo passed only ten feet\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nIt was an ideal day for torpedo attack--light wind, slight ripple,\r\nclear weather. The periscope could only have been a few inches above\r\nwater, for a very strict lookout was being kept at the time by chief\r\nand third officers and myself and four lookout men. However, we failed\r\nto see her before she fired the torpedo.\r\n\r\nNot the least warning was given, and most or nearly all the passengers\r\nwere asleep at the time. It was almost another case of brutal murder.\r\n\r\nWe had twenty-one American passengers on board.\r\n\r\n_A Washington dispatch of July 20 to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _announced:_\r\n\r\nThe President and the Cabinet decided today to have an investigation\r\nmade in the case of the British steamer Orduna, which was attacked by\r\na German submarine on July 9 while on her way from Liverpool to New\r\nYork. This action was taken following the receipt of a statement from\r\nW.O. Thompson, counsel of the Federal Industrial Commission, who was a\r\npassenger on the ship.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson did not see any torpedo fired at the Orduna by the German\r\nsubmarine, and was unable to give first-hand testimony that the Orduna\r\nhad been fired on without notice. It was determined, however, that the\r\nreport of Mr. Thompson justified the Government in making an\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Secretary Lansing wrote a letter to Secretary McAdoo,\r\nrequesting that his department undertake the investigation, which will\r\nprobably be intrusted to the Collector of Customs at New York.\r\n\r\nAt the State Department it was said that the attention of the German\r\nGovernment had not been called to the charge that the Orduna was fired\r\non by a German submarine without warning. Any action of that sort, if\r\ntaken, will follow the investigation which is now ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEBRASKAN'S CASE\r\n\r\n_Ambassador Gerard on July 15 formally transmitted to Washington\r\nGermany's admission of liability and expression of regret for the\r\nattack by a German submarine on the American steamer Nebraskan._\r\n\r\n_Secretary Lansing's announcement of the German memorandum follows:_\r\n\r\nAmbassador Gerard has telegraphed to the Department of State the\r\nfollowing memorandum from the German Foreign Office relative to the\r\ndamaging of the American steamer Nebraskan by a German submarine:\r\n\r\n\"The German Government received from newspaper reports the\r\nintelligence that the American steamer Nebraskan had been damaged by a\r\nmine or torpedo on the southwest coast of Ireland. It therefore\r\nstarted a thorough investigation of the case without delay, and from\r\nthe result of the investigation it has become convinced that the\r\ndamage to the Nebraskan was caused by an attack by a submarine.\r\n\r\n\"On the evening of May 25 last the submarine met a steamer bound\r\nwestward without a flag and no neutral markings on her freeboard,\r\nabout 65 nautical miles west of Fastnet Rock. No appliance of any kind\r\nfor the illumination of the flag or markings was to be seen. In the\r\ntwilight, which had already set in, the name of the steamer was not\r\nvisible from the submarine. Since the commander of the submarine was\r\nobliged to assume from his wide experience in the area of maritime war\r\nthat only English steamers, and no neutral steamers, traversed the war\r\narea without flag and markings, he attacked the vessel with a torpedo,\r\nin the conviction that he had an enemy vessel before him. Some time\r\nafter the shot the commander saw that the vessel had in the meantime\r\nhoisted the American flag. As a consequence, he, of course, refrained\r\nfrom any further attack. Since the vessel remained afloat, he had no\r\noccasion to concern himself further with the boats which had been\r\nlaunched.\r\n\r\n\"It results from this that without a doubt that attack on the steamer\r\nNebraskan was not meant for the American flag, nor is it traceable to\r\nany fault on the part of the commander of the German submarine, but is\r\nto be considered an unfortunate accident. The German Government\r\nexpresses its regret at the occurrence to the Government of the United\r\nStates of America and declares its readiness to make compensation for\r\nthe damage thereby sustained by American citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults of Submarine Warfare\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVERPOOL'S EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\n_A London cable dispatch to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES, _dated London, July\r\n8, said:_\r\n\r\nNearly 20,000 vessels have entered or left the port of Liverpool since\r\nthe German submarine blockade began. This, said Sir A. Norman Hill,\r\nSecretary of the Liverpool Steamship Owners' Association, speaking at\r\nLiverpool yesterday, showed that the Germans had failed in their\r\nattempt to blockade British ports.\r\n\r\nOn these 20,000 voyages the Germans had captured or destroyed only\r\ntwenty-nine ships, he continued. What did that represent? Ships which\r\nhad sailed in and out of Liverpool had completed in safety 998 out of\r\nevery 1,000 voyages upon which they started. That was a magnificent\r\nrecord, he held, of perils faced and overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST WEEK WITH NO LOSS\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch of July 22 from London remarked:_\r\n\r\nSo far as British vessels were concerned, the German submarines drew a\r\nblank during the week ended yesterday. Not a single British merchant\r\nship or fishing craft was sunk.\r\n\r\nIt was the first week since the war began that some loss to British\r\nshipping had not been occasioned by German cruisers, mines, or\r\nsubmarines.\r\n\r\nDuring the week 1,326 vessels of more than 300 tons each arrived at or\r\ndeparted from ports of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe German war-zone decree went into effect on February 18. Since then\r\nthe weekly losses of ships and lives from torpedoes have been as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_Week Ending_    _Vessels._   _Lives._\r\nFebruary 25         11           9\r\nMarch 4              1           0\r\nMarch 11             7          38\r\nMarch 18             6          13\r\nMarch 25             7           2\r\nApril 1             13         165\r\nApril 8              8          13\r\nApril 15             4           0\r\nApril 22             3          10\r\nApril 29             3           0\r\nMay 6               24           5\r\nMay 13               2       1,260\r\nMay 20               7          13\r\nMay 27               7           7\r\nJune 3              19          32\r\nJune 10             36          21\r\nJune 17             19          19\r\nJune 24              3           1\r\nJuly 1               9          29\r\nJuly 8              15           2\r\nJuly 15             12          13\r\nJuly 22              2           0\r\n                   ---       -----\r\nTotal              218       1,652\r\n\r\nOf the two vessels torpedoed in the week of July 22, the Russian\r\nsteamer Balwa was attacked on July 16. On the following day another\r\nRussian steamer, the General Radetzky, was torpedoed. Both hailed from\r\nRiga, and the crews of both were saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARFARE MODIFIED?\r\n\r\n_A record reported to have been compiled chiefly from British\r\nAdmiralty sources since the sinking of the Lusitania was published by\r\nThe New York American on July 13, showing that out of 122 ships sunk\r\nby German submarines in the war zone, every passenger or sailor was\r\nsaved on all but 14. Following is The American's summary:_\r\n\r\nTotal number of ships definitely reported\r\nsunk by German submarines\r\nin sixty-four days, since the\r\nLusitania was torpedoed                       122\r\n\r\nNumber of ships on which any loss\r\nof life occurred                               14\r\n\r\n[Note: Some of these fatalities\r\noccurred, according to British Admiralty\r\nreports, either from explosion\r\nof torpedoes or from upsetting\r\nof lifeboats, or from gunfire of submarines\r\nwhile the enemy ship was\r\ntrying to escape.]\r\n\r\nTotal loss of life on 122 ships, from\r\nall causes                                    131\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN ACCOUNTS\r\n\r\n_In a Berlin dispatch of July 14, by wireless to Sayville, Long\r\nIsland, the following was given out by the Overseas News Agency:_\r\n\r\nDuring the month of June twenty-nine British, three French, one\r\nBelgian, and nine Russian merchantmen were sunk by German submarines.\r\n\r\nThe total loss of the Entente Allies by submarines, including fishing\r\nsteamers, which mostly were armed patrol boats, aggregated 125,000\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nThe loss of human life was remarkably small, the submarines using\r\nevery precaution and giving ample warning and time for crews to leave\r\ntheir ships if no resistance was attempted.\r\n\r\n_The total of losses in ships of the Allies' merchant marine around\r\nthe English coast in the period between February 18 (the beginning of\r\nthe German submarine war zone) and May 18, as compiled from German\r\ndata, was published in the Frankfurter Zeitung of June 6. This\r\npublication, the first issue from German quarters, contains also a\r\nlist of the various allied ships sunk, totaling 111, together with the\r\nnationality and tonnage of each, and a charted map of the British\r\nIsles showing where each ship was sunk._\r\n\r\n_In describing the achievements of the German submarine against their\r\nfoes--the neutral ships sunk are not included--the Frankfurter\r\nZeitung's article says:_\r\n\r\nIn the period of three months since the 18th of February, a day\r\nmemorable for history, our submarines have inflicted on the enemy\r\nmerchant shipping, in the first place the English merchant marine, a\r\ntotal loss of 111 ships with a displacement of 234,239 tons. The\r\nfigures may, perhaps, not seem especially large in comparison with the\r\ngigantic number of merchant ships flying the flag of the enemy. But in\r\nthis method of warfare the percentage loss of ships of our opponent as\r\ncompared with his total does not count, but rather the fact that\r\nthrough the regularity and inevitableness of the marine catastrophes\r\nthe enemy shipping shall be disturbed as poignantly as possible, and\r\nthat there should as a result of this disturbance appear in the\r\neconomic life of England phenomena similar to those which the English\r\nplan of the isolation of Germany aims at without, however, having\r\nsucceeded in getting any nearer to its goal, owing to the inherent\r\nstrength and power of adaptation of German business.\r\n\r\nThe rise of prices now prevalent in England, and the paralyzing of\r\ngreat branches of trade which could not occur in an England that\r\nreally ruled the sea, may be attributed in chief part to this war of\r\nthe submarines. The advantage of the insular position of England has\r\nbeen greatly lessened, thanks to this excellent German weapon, even if\r\nit cannot be completely eliminated. But if one compares with the total\r\nvoyages of the English merchant shipping the losses of the English\r\nmerchant marine, amounting to more than 100 ships in a period of\r\nexactly ninety days, and a tonnage of 216,000 tons, (from the totals\r\nmentioned above there must be deducted the shares of France and\r\nRussia,) then we must consider only that part of the British merchant\r\nmarine that entered ports of the island kingdom in this period or left\r\nthem; and one must bear in mind further that a large number of those\r\nships is contained several times in the English statistics, since they\r\ndo coast service.\r\n\r\nBut as valuable booty for our submarines particularly those ships are\r\nto be regarded that import any kinds of commodities to England. And\r\nstatistics will later be able to show on the basis of these figures\r\nthe great success of the German submarine warfare, as indicated by\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map that accompanies the list of losses suffices to\r\nshow that mine fields as little as great distances are factors of\r\ndecisive importance in the activities of our submarines. The closing\r\nof the English Channel and of the North Channel (between Ireland and\r\nScotland) has not prevented our boats from penetrating wherever there\r\nwas booty. Even on the northwest coast of Scotland and out in the west\r\nof Ireland the German submarines have carried on a successful hunt.\r\nThe numbers in the little circles on the map represent the successive\r\nships on the list.\r\n\r\n_The Frankfurter Zeitung adds figures given by the British Admiralty\r\non the same subject. These, it says, total 130 merchant ships with a\r\nregistered tonnage of 457,000 tons, from the beginning of the war to\r\nMay 26. Added to these, it says, are 83 fishing vessels with a tonnage\r\nof 13,585 tons, making a total of 213 ships with 470,585 tons. It\r\nsays:_\r\n\r\nThese figures, however, are certainly incomplete, inasmuch as up to\r\nMarch 16 there had already been announced 145 ships with a total\r\ntonnage of 500,000 as lost, and the figures published by us above,\r\nbased upon authentic material, concerning the victims of our\r\nsubmarines in three months, contradict beyond any power of dispute the\r\neuphemistic presentation of the British Admiralty. Even so, however,\r\nthe English list still shows that since the beginning of the submarine\r\nwarfare, although in that period there was little to speak of in the\r\nway of activities of the German cruisers abroad, the damage done to\r\nthe English fleet has risen according to the confession of the\r\nAdmiralty itself. Since Feb. 18, that is to say, since scarcely more\r\nthan a quarter of a year, according to the English figures, no less\r\nthan 56 British merchant ships with a tonnage of 187,000 tons (that is\r\nto say, more than 40 per cent. of the total number of merchant ships\r\ndesignated as lost) have been sunk. But if instead of these English\r\nfigures the German compilation, which is indubitably correct, be\r\naccepted, then the entire picture changes considerably in our favor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Memoriam:\r\n\r\nREGINALD WARNEFORD\r\n\r\n[From Truth of London]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Young gallant soul, unversed in fear,\r\n      Who swiftly flew aloft to fame,\r\n      And made yourself a world-wide name,\r\n    Ere scarce had dawned your brief career.\r\n\r\n    To glory some but slowly climb\r\n      By painful inches of ascent,\r\n      And some, hereon though sternly bent,\r\n    Ne'er reach it all their life's long time.\r\n\r\n    But you--you soared as eagles soar;\r\n      At one strong flight you flashed on high;\r\n      The sudden chance came sudden nigh;\r\n    You seized it; off its spoils you bore.\r\n\r\n    And now, while still the welkin rings\r\n      With your unmatched heroic deed,\r\n      To paean elegies succeed,\r\n    The mournful Muse your requiem sings.\r\n\r\n    A requiem, yet with triumph rife!\r\n      How not, while men their souls would give\r\n      To die your death, so they might live\r\n    Your \"crowded hour of glorious life\"?\r\n\r\n    Great hour, that knows not time nor tide,\r\n      Wild hour, that drinks an age's sweets,\r\n      Brave hour, that throbs with breathless feats,\r\n    Short hour, whose splendours long abide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Preparedness\r\n\r\nBy Theodore Roosevelt\r\n\r\n\r\n_In an address at the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco,\r\ndelivered on July 21, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt said:_\r\n\r\nI have a very strong feeling about the Panama Exposition. It was my\r\ngood fortune to take the action in 1903, failure to take which, in\r\nexactly the shape I took it, would have meant that no Panama Canal\r\nwould have been built for half a century, and, therefore, that there\r\nwould have been no exposition to celebrate the building of the canal.\r\nIn everything we did in connection with the acquiring of the Panama\r\nZone we acted in a way to do absolute justice to all other nations, to\r\nbenefit all other nations, including especially the adjacent States,\r\nand to render the utmost service, from the standpoint alike of honor\r\nand of material interest, to the United States. I am glad that this is\r\nthe case, for if there were the slightest taint upon our title or our\r\nconduct it would have been an improper and shameful thing to hold this\r\nexposition.\r\n\r\nThe building of the canal nearly doubles the potential efficiency of\r\nthe United States Navy, as long as it is fortified and is in our\r\nhands; but if left unfortified it would at once become a menace to us.\r\n\r\nWhat is true as to our proper attitude in regard to the canal is no\r\nless true as regards our proper attitude concerning the interests of\r\nthe United States taken as a whole. The canal is to be a great agency\r\nfor peace; it can be such only, and exactly in proportion as it\r\nincreased our potential efficiency in war.\r\n\r\nThose men who like myself believe that the highest duty of this nation\r\nis to prepare itself against war so that it may safely trust its honor\r\nand interest to its own strength are advocating merely that we do as a\r\nnation regarding our general interests what we have already done in\r\nPanama. If, instead of acting as this nation did in the Fall of 1903,\r\nwe had confined ourselves to debates in Congress and diplomatic notes;\r\nif, in other words, we had treated elocution as a substitute for\r\naction, we would have done nobody any good, and for ourselves we would\r\nhave earned the hearty derision of all other nations--the canal would\r\nnot even have been begun at the present day, and there would have been\r\na general consensus of international opinion to the effect that we\r\nwere totally unfit to perform any of the duties of international life,\r\nespecially in connection with the Western hemisphere.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately in the last few years we have as regards pretty much\r\neverything not connected with the Isthmus of Panama so failed in our\r\nduty of national preparedness that I fear there actually is a general\r\nconsensus of opinion to precisely this effect among the nations of the\r\nworld as regards the United States at the present day. This is\r\nprimarily due to our unpreparedness.\r\n\r\nWe have been culpably, well-nigh criminally, remiss as a nation in not\r\npreparing ourselves, and if, with the lessons taught the world by the\r\ndreadful tragedies of the last twelve months, we continue with soft\r\ncomplacency to stand helpless and naked before the world, we shall\r\nexcite only contempt and derision if and when disaster ultimately\r\noverwhelms us.\r\n\r\nPreparedness against war does not invariably avert war any more than a\r\nfire department in a city will invariably avert a fire; and there are\r\nwell-meaning foolish people who point out this fact as offering an\r\nexcuse for unpreparedness. It would be just as sensible if after the\r\nChicago fire Chicago had announced that it would abolish its fire\r\ndepartment as for our people to take the same view as regards\r\nmilitary preparedness. Some years ago I was looking over some very old\r\nnewspapers contemporaneous with the early establishment of paid fire\r\ndepartments in this country, and to my amusement I came across a\r\nletter which argued against a paid fire department upon the ground\r\nthat the knowledge of its existence would tend to make householders\r\ncareless, and therefore would encourage fires.\r\n\r\nGreece was not prepared for war when she went to war with Turkey a\r\nscore of years ago. But this fact did not stop the war. It merely made\r\nthe war unsuccessful for Greece. China was not prepared for war with\r\nJapan twenty-odd years ago, nor for war with the Allies who marched to\r\nPeking fifteen years ago.\r\n\r\n_Colonel Roosevelt then discussed in detail the cases of China and\r\nBelgium, comparing Belgium with Switzerland, and asserting that\r\nSwitzerland would have met Belgium's fate if she had not been prepared\r\nto oppose invasion. Then taking up the case of China, he said:_\r\n\r\nShe has acted on the theory that the worst peace was better than the\r\nbest war, and therefore she has suffered all the evils of the worst\r\nwar and the worst peace. The average Chinaman took the view that China\r\nwas too proud to fight and in practice made evident his hearty\r\napproval of the sentiments of that abject pacifist song: \"I Didn't\r\nRaise My Boy to be a Soldier,\" a song which should have as a companion\r\npiece one entitled: \"I Didn't Raise my Girl to be a Mother,\" approval\r\nof which of course deprives any men or women of all right of kinship\r\nwith the soldiers and with the mothers and wives of the soldiers,\r\nwhose valor and services we commemorate on the Fourth of July and on\r\nDecoration Day; a song, the singing of which seems incredible to every\r\nman and woman capable of being stirred to lofty and generous\r\nenthusiasm by the tremendous surge of Julia Ward Howe's \"Battle Hymn\r\nof the Republic.\" China has steadily refused to prepare for war.\r\nAccordingly China has had province after province lopped off her,\r\nuntil one-half of her territory is now under Japanese, Russian,\r\nEnglish and French control.\r\n\r\nThe professional pacifists, the peace-at-any-price, non-resistance,\r\nuniversal arbitration people are now seeking to Chinafy this country.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year or so this nation has negotiated some thirty\r\nall-inclusive peace treaties by which it is agreed that if any issue\r\narises, no matter of what kind, between itself and any other nation,\r\nit would take no final steps about it until a commission of\r\ninvestigation had discussed the matter for a year. This was an\r\nexplicit promise in each case that if American women were raped and\r\nAmerican men murdered, as has actually occurred in Mexico; or American\r\nmen, women, and children drowned on the high seas, as in the case of\r\nthe Gulflight and Lusitania; or if a foreign power secured and\r\nfortified Magdalena Bay or the Island of St. Thomas, we would appoint\r\na commission and listen to a year's conversation on the subject before\r\ntaking action.\r\n\r\nEngland and France entered into these treaties with us, and we begged\r\nGermany to enter into one, and, although Germany refused, yet if we\r\nwere right in entering into them with England and France, we deprived\r\nourselves of moral justification in refusing to fulfill their spirit\r\nas regards Germany. Personally I believe that it was absolutely\r\nnecessary when the concrete case arose to repudiate the principle to\r\nwhich we had thus committed ourselves. But it was a shameful thing to\r\nhave put ourselves in such a position that it had to be repudiated,\r\nand it was inexcusable of us to decline to follow the principle in the\r\ncase of the Lusitania without at the same time making frank confession\r\nof our error and misconduct by notifying all the powers with whom we\r\nhad already made the treaties that they were withdrawn, because in\r\npractice we had found it impossible and improper to follow out the\r\nprinciple to which they committed us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Year of the War\r\n\r\nMilitary Resumes of Operations on All Fronts--August, 1914 to August,\r\n1915\r\n\r\nBy Lieutenant Walter E. Ives\r\n\r\n_Formerly of the Royal Prussian Thirteenth Dragoons_\r\n\r\n_and_\r\n\r\nBy An American Military Expert\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Year's War\r\n\r\nBy LIEUTENANT WALTER E. IVES\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\nThe first year of the European war has drawn to a close. A resume\r\ncovering the military events it has produced brings to view two\r\ndistinct phases of the campaign. The first phase comprises the period\r\nfrom Aug. 3 to Oct. 27, and consists of a tenacious effort to carry\r\nthrough the original plan of war of the German General Staff: to\r\nstrike a crushing blow at France, and after putting her \"hors de\r\ncombat,\" to turn on the enemy in the East. The second phase comprises\r\nthe time from Oct. 27 to the present, and consists in the pursuance of\r\nmilitary aims forming the direct reversal of the original ones.\r\n\r\nThe campaign against France, in consequence of the German plan of\r\nstrategy the first one to come into prominence, can, in its first\r\nphase, be divided into four periods.\r\n\r\nThe first period comprises the operations in Belgium, German Lorraine\r\nand Alsace, from Aug. 3 to Aug. 23, the day before the Battle for the\r\nInvasion of France, commonly, but incorrectly known as the battle of\r\nMons.\r\n\r\nThe main blow at France was to come through Belgium. Five German\r\narmies out of eight were hurled against this gateway to Northern\r\nFrance. In Lorraine and Alsace the Germans were temporarily to remain\r\non the defensive. The protection of Lorraine was intrusted to the\r\nBavarian (Sixth) Army, that of Alsace to the remaining two armies.\r\n\r\nThe French plan of operation was to check the invasion of Belgium on\r\nthe line Tongres-Liege-Longwy, where the Belgian Army, from a strictly\r\nmilitary point of view, forming the advance guards of the French Army\r\nof the North, was holding strong positions, and with superior forces\r\nto strike at the German Army of Lorraine. The aim was, avoiding Metz,\r\nto reach the Moselle near Trier through the valley of the Saar, and to\r\nroll up the German Army of the North from its left wing. An invasion\r\nof Alsace was merely to satisfy political aspirations.\r\n\r\nThe German advance in Belgium, however, remained unchecked, and in\r\nLorraine the battles of Dieuze and Saarbourg on Aug. 20 decided the\r\nissue in favor of the Bavarians. In Alsace the French were victorious\r\nover the Eighth Army and took Muelhausen, while further north, between\r\nMuenster and Shirmeck, the Seventh Army checked the French invasion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the German avalanche in Belgium had reached the second line\r\nof defense, Brussels-Namur-Longwy, before the French Army of the\r\nNorth. The capture of Namur prompted the French staff to recall\r\nadvance guards, which had reached the fortress just as it surrendered,\r\nand to accept battle in the line Mons-Charleroi-Givet-Longwy. The\r\nbattle for the invasion of France and the retirement of the French\r\narmies in all the theatres of action which it caused opens the second\r\nperiod of the campaign against France.\r\n\r\nThe English contingent from Havre had joined the French Army just\r\nbefore the German onslaught began. The battle was lost by the Allies\r\ntactically and strategically through the defeat of their right wing at\r\nLongwy and Neufchateau, and through the encircling of their left wing\r\nat Mons. The direct result of the outcome was the German invasion of\r\nFrance; the indirect consequence (resulting from the necessity of\r\ndrawing troops from the other fields of action to stem the German\r\ninvasion) was the retirement of the French armies in Lorraine and\r\nAlsace to the line Verdun-Nancy-St. Die, and further south to the\r\npasses of the Vosges, which they have been holding ever since.\r\n\r\nSweeping on through Northern France, the German Army of the North was\r\nbreaking up all resistance in its path, such as was attempted by the\r\nBritish at St. Quentin on Aug. 28, and was tearing with it all\r\nfortresses, such as Longwy, La Fere, Maubeuge, and others; but it was\r\nfailing in its principal aim: to embrace the skillfully retreating\r\nenemy before he could reach the line Paris-Verdun, which he had\r\nselected and prepared for the next stand.\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 30 the German plan of strategy was changed, and it was\r\nresolved to break the centre of the enemy, throwing his left wing into\r\nParis and on the Seine and his right wing into Verdun, Toul, and\r\nEpinal. The armies of the centre were pushed forward, while either\r\nwing held back. The Allies were established in the general line\r\nParis-Verdun.\r\n\r\nThe battle ensuing on Sept. 5 and the retreat of the Germans to the\r\nAisne are the events of the third period of this campaign, lasting\r\nfrom Sept. 5 to Sept. 28. On Sept. 8, while the German attacks had all\r\nbut pierced the French centre, having already bent it back beyond the\r\nline Sezanne-Vitry, the German right wing found itself outflanked by a\r\nnew allied army from Paris, which was rapidly moving northward and\r\nthreatened to roll up the entire German battle front from the\r\ndirection of Compiegne. The critical question, who would succeed\r\nfirst, the Allies in outflanking the German right or the Germans in\r\npiercing the French centre, was decided in favor of the Allies.\r\nAnglo-French strategy triumphed.\r\n\r\nThe tactical aspect of the situation, though, is best illustrated by\r\nthe message sent to his commander-in-chief by General Foch, commanding\r\nthe French Army of the Centre when he received the order to\r\ncounter-attack: \"My left has been forced back, my right is routed. I\r\nshall attack with the centre.\" When the counter-attack came it found\r\nbut rear guards opposing it. The retreat of the Germans, their right\r\nflank constantly in danger of being rolled up, was a fine military\r\nachievement. On Sept. 12 it halted on the Aisne. In the regions\r\nnortheast of Verdun the German left wing joined hands with the Sixth\r\nGerman Army, which had followed up the retirement of the French Army\r\nof Lorraine to the line Verdun-St. Die.\r\n\r\nThus resting on Metz with its left wing the German battle-front was\r\nstrongly established on a line passing Verdun, to the east and\r\nnortheast, extending from there in a general westerly direction to the\r\nvalley of the Aisne as far as the region north of Compiegne, and from\r\nthat point northward to the region west of Peronne and Cambrai.\r\n\r\nThe stability of this line, enabling a constant shifting of forces\r\ntoward the right wing, and the arrival there of the army released from\r\nMaubeuge, made possible the extension of the battle-front to the\r\nregion of Arras, and frustrated all flanking movements on the part of\r\nthe Allies.\r\n\r\nThe situation was again safe, but the plan to put the French army hors\r\nde combat was far from having been realized. The German General Staff\r\ntherefore decided on a new plan. Its purpose was to gain control of\r\nthe northeast coast of France. A wedge should be driven between the\r\ntwo allied countries, and Pas-de-Calais made the base of further\r\noperations against both. The following out of this plan constitutes\r\nthe fourth and last period of the first phase of the western\r\ncampaign. It starts with the beginning of the siege of Antwerp on\r\nSept. 28 and ends with the first battle of Ypres on Oct. 27.\r\n\r\nThe first step toward the accomplishment of the new aims was the\r\ncapture of Antwerp. Antwerp in the hands of the Allies meant a\r\nconstant menace to the German line of communication; in possession of\r\nthe Germans it signified the key to Northern France. The fortress was\r\ntaken on Oct. 9. The next point of strategic importance for the\r\npursuance of the German plan was Lille, which was taken on Oct. 12.\r\n\r\nBut the change in the German plan of strategy had been recognized by\r\nthe Allies, and a new English army from Havre was hurried to the line\r\nBethune-Dunkirk to extend the allied left wing to the coast and block\r\nthe road to Calais. It reached West Flanders on Oct. 13, and on Oct.\r\n16 it came in contact with the German Army that approached from\r\nAntwerp. The latter joined the German right wing north of Lille and\r\nextended it to Westende. On the 18th, after having brought up all\r\ntheir reserves, the Germans began their onslaught to break through in\r\nthe region of Dixmude and Ypres.\r\n\r\nWhile, by Oct. 27, no appreciable impression had been made on the\r\nallied battleline, the situation in the eastern seat of war had begun\r\nto assume an alarming aspect, and necessitated the complete change in\r\nthe German plan of strategy, which marks the beginning of the second\r\nphase of the war.\r\n\r\nOn the western front this second phase meant for the Germans the going\r\ninto the defensive along the entire battleline, which the allied\r\narmies have been relentlessly attempting to break. In spite of their\r\ncontinuous heroic efforts only minor successes, such as that of the\r\nBritish at Neuve Chapelle and that of the French to the north of\r\nArras, have been achieved. Counter attacks, forming the most essential\r\nelement of the modern defensive, have been launched by the Germans\r\nincessantly, and have on several occasions resulted in successes\r\nsimilar to those of the Allies, as, for instance, at Soissons and at\r\nYpres. On the whole, no changes of strategic importance have taken\r\nplace, and the German wall in France stands firm to this day.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE EASTERN CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\nWhile, in the early days of August, the bulk of the German Army was\r\nmoving westward, not more than ten army corps were available for the\r\ncampaign against Russia. To them and to the Austrian armies fell the\r\ntask of laying the basis for the offensive contemplated for a later\r\ndate. The plan of campaign was to draw the Russians into the Polish\r\nbag and tie it up. It was based on the knowledge that Russia's\r\nprincipal strategic aim must, under all circumstances, be Cracow, the\r\ngateway to Vienna and Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was to be allowed to reach it through Poland, while the\r\nGermans should hold on to East Prussia and the Austrians to Galicia,\r\nto flank the Russian advance from the north and south in preparation\r\nfor a campaign against the Russian lines of communication. This scheme\r\nof bagging the enemy has governed all strategic moves of the campaign\r\nagainst Russia to this day.\r\n\r\nBut the Muscovites were on their guard. They paid little attention to\r\nthe few German divisions that were thrown into Poland in August, in\r\norder to attract a Russian offensive, and began hammering at the\r\nTeutonic flanking positions along the East Prussian frontier in the\r\nnorth and the line Lublin-Tarnopol in the south.\r\n\r\nWhile the Russian offensive in East Prussia came to grief at\r\nTannenberg, it was most successful against Galicia, and the eighth\r\nweek of the war already found the Russian invasion west of the San,\r\nPrzemysl besieged, and the Austrian right wing flanked by vast bodies\r\nof cavalry, which had penetrated the Carpathian passes and reached the\r\nregion of Munkacs.\r\n\r\nTo relieve the pressure exerted on their Allies and give them a chance\r\nonce more to establish themselves in north-eastern Galicia, four\r\nGerman army corps invaded Poland and advanced toward Radom and\r\nIvangorod. This counter move was successful. Menaced in their right\r\nflank, the Russians quickly took back their army beyond the San. The\r\nAustrians followed, raised the siege of Przemysl, and drove the\r\ninvaders from Hungary and straightened out their line from Sandomir to\r\nCzernowitz.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile heavy Russian reinforcements had been brought up from\r\nIvangorod and were gradually put in action against the Germans east of\r\nRadom. On Oct. 24, as soon as the Russian superiority became alarming,\r\nthe four German army corps, having, temporarily at least, accomplished\r\ntheir purpose of re-establishing the Austrian campaign, beat a hasty\r\nretreat toward Silesia, during which the second purpose of their\r\ninvasion, to draw into the Polish bag great masses of Russian troops,\r\nwas successfully achieved, the Russians having been led to believe\r\nthat they were pursuing a great German army.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, though, with their advance in the path of the German\r\nretreat in Poland, the Russians once more concentrated vast forces\r\nagainst the menacing projection of the Austrian battleline in Galicia,\r\nand the early days of November witnessed the second invasion of the\r\nAustrian province. At the same time a new drive was made on East\r\nPrussia, and the Germans were forced back into the region of the\r\nMasurian Lakes.\r\n\r\nThe retirement of the entire Teutonic battleline before the Russians,\r\nwho toward the end of October had reached the maximum of their\r\nstrength, marks the end of the first phase of the eastern campaign. It\r\nhad not accomplished all that had been expected of it. The enemy had\r\nbeen drawn far into South Poland, but the base of operations for the\r\ngeneral offensive against his communications in the north had not been\r\nestablished just where it should have been, and the Russian frontier\r\nfortifications had been found better prepared for resistance than\r\nthose of Belgium, while in the south the Austrian base of operations\r\nwas entirely in the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe second phase of the eastern campaign was therefore opened from a\r\nnew base--Thorn, where the main army had been gathered ever since Oct.\r\n27, when the Russian danger had become alarming, and the offensive in\r\nthe west had been abandoned. It was suddenly launched with\r\nirresistible force on Nov. 12, and rolled back numerically inferior\r\nRussian armies, whose task it had been to protect the right flank of\r\nthe Russian advance on Silesia.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the danger to their operations in South Poland and\r\nGalicia, where they had meanwhile approached the line of the Warta,\r\nCracow, and Neu Sandec, the Russians threw troops into North Poland\r\nfrom all sides and succeeded in temporarily detaining the German\r\nadvance there, while they were continuing their supreme efforts to\r\nbreak the Austro-German line south of Cracow. But the line held. At\r\nthe same time the German drive in North Poland was making steady\r\nheadway.\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 6 the Germans took Lodz, and further north advanced on Lowitz,\r\nand the Russian offensive in the Cracow district was given up. While\r\nall troops that could be spared were sent northeast to support the\r\nprepared lines of the Bzura and Rawka Rivers, the Russians in the\r\nsouth fell back behind the Nida and Dunajec, joining with their right\r\nwing their northern army in the region of Tomaschew, and extending\r\ntheir left through the region of Gorlitz and Torka toward the Pruth.\r\nIn this line the Teutonic advance was checked. A new German drive on\r\nthe road from Soldau to Warsaw could likewise make no headway beyond\r\nMlawa, while on the other hand in East Prussia the Russian offensive\r\nhad been brought to a standstill.\r\n\r\nA siege warfare, like that in France, seemed imminent, except in the\r\nBukowina, where Russian forces during January were driving Austrian\r\ntroops before them. The Russian invasion of that province, however,\r\nso distant from all strategically important points, was but a\r\npolitical manoeuvre.\r\n\r\nThe first movement of any consequence to occur was a desperate attempt\r\nof the Austrians early in February to push forward with their right\r\nwing in the direction of Stanislau, chiefly to bring relief to the\r\ngarrison of Przemysl. Simultaneously they began sweeping the Russians\r\nout of Bukovina. The latter undertaking was successful, but the\r\nadvance on Stanislau was thrown back toward Nadworna.\r\n\r\nWhile the Austrian offensive was under way, General von Hindenburg\r\nunexpectedly launched a vigorous attack in East Prussia, which\r\nresulted in the destruction of the Russian East Prussian Army in the\r\nregion of the Masurian Lakes. Once more a successful drive at the\r\nRussian \"bread line\" from the north seemed at hand. Already the armies\r\npursuing the Russians were hammering at the Russian fortifications\r\nalong the Niemen, Bobr, and Narew when the surrender of Przemysl, the\r\nsiege of which had uninterruptedly gone on behind the Russian lines\r\nsince November, on March 22 again presented to the Russians an\r\nopportunity to break the Austrian battleline.\r\n\r\nTo check the onslaught of the reinforced Russian armies against the\r\nCarpathian passes early in April, troops must be drawn from General\r\nvon Hindenberg's armies, and the consequence was another deadlock in\r\nthe north. Meanwhile the reinforced Teutonic troops were hurriedly\r\nconcentrated for the counter-attack against the Russian offensive in\r\nthe Carpathians, and a great drive began against the Russian positions\r\non the Dunajec line, east of Cracow, early in May. Breaking all\r\nresistance, it swept on toward Jaroslau and Przemysl on a sixty-mile\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nThreatened in their right and left flanks, respectively, the Russian\r\nlines on the Nida and in the Carpathians fell back rapidly, while\r\nreinforcements were sent to stem the Teutonic advance along the San.\r\nBut the Russian efforts were in vain. The momentum the Teutonic\r\noffensive had gained carried it across the river, while further south\r\nthe Austrian right wing cleared the entire Carpathian front of the\r\nenemy, hotly pushing his retreat.\r\n\r\nPrzemysl was recaptured, the third Russian line of defense from\r\nRawa-Ruska to Grodeck and the Dniester was broken, and the end of June\r\nsaw Lemberg once more in the hands of the Teutons, and the Russian\r\nline on the defensive and sorely pressed along a front extending from\r\nthe Bessarabian frontier along the Dniester to the mouth of the\r\nZlota-Lipa, and from there along the Zlota-Lipa and the Bug, well into\r\nRussian territory, leaving the river southeast of Grubeschow, and\r\ncontinuing from there in a northwesterly direction to the region of\r\nKrasnik.\r\n\r\nHere it joined hands with the left wing of the Russian Army of the\r\nNida, which had retired before the Austro-German advance in a\r\nnortheasterly direction, intrenching along a line from Krasnik across\r\nthe Vistula and through Sjenno and Jastrshob (about fifteen miles\r\nsouthwest of Radom) to the region of Tomaschew on the Pilitza.\r\n\r\nWhile this great Spring offensive from the Dunajec line was well under\r\nway, small German forces invaded the Russian province of Courland.\r\nFinding at first little resistance in the path of their unexpected\r\nadvance, they took Libau and established themselves on the\r\nDubissa-Windau line. During July the operations in Courland steadily\r\nassumed greater proportions.\r\n\r\nTwo bases for the campaign against the Russian lines of communication\r\nhave thus been firmly established in the flanks of the Russian Armies\r\nwest of the Vistula, both protruding far into their rear. Drives\r\nagainst the Dunaburg-Warsaw line from the north and the\r\nMinsk-Ivangorod line from the south will open the second year of the\r\neastern campaign. The first year of the incessant struggle has brought\r\nthe aims of the German strategy, the bagging of the Russian Armies,\r\nwithin sight of its realization.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGNS OF MINOR IMPORTANCE\r\n\r\nWhile the struggle in the two principal seats of war has been going\r\non, the passing year has witnessed fighting also of secondary\r\nimportance, though not less heroic, in three other fields of action:\r\nSerbia, Turkey, and the Austro-Italian frontier. Whereas Turkey joined\r\nthe Teutons but three months after the beginning of hostilities, and\r\nItaly was involved only at the end of May, Serbia was one of the first\r\nnations to take the field.\r\n\r\nAustria's campaign against the little kingdom could under no\r\ncircumstances influence the events of the war, and was therefore void\r\nof any strategic importance. For this reason, but three Austrian Army\r\ncorps were engaged in it.\r\n\r\nThe purpose was merely to keep the Serbians busy, and prevent them\r\nfrom invading Austrian soil. For the sake of the moral effect on the\r\nother Balkan States the capture of Belgrade should be attempted. In\r\nview of the strength of the Danube fortifications the operations were\r\nlaunched from Bosnia and resulted in the forcing of the Drina line and\r\nthe capture of Valjevo on Nov. 17. The Serbian positions on the Danube\r\nhaving thus been flanked, the abandonment of Belgrade on Dec. 2 was a\r\nnatural consequence of the Battle of Valjevo.\r\n\r\nMisled by their successes into the belief that the Serbian army had\r\nbeen placed hors de combat, the Austrians advanced beyond the lines\r\ndestined to constitute the object of their offensive. In the difficult\r\nmountain districts southeast of Valjevo the Serbians turned on the\r\ninvaders with superior forces and defeated them. The Austrian retreat\r\nto the Drina which followed, necessitated the evacuation of Belgrade\r\non Dec. 15. Since then, the situation on the Serbian frontier has been\r\na deadlock, only desultory and insignificant fighting occurring for\r\nthe rest of the year.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the operations in Serbia, Turkey's campaign has direct\r\nbearing on the European war. Its chief feature, the closing of the\r\nDardanelles, has been a serious blow to Russia. The frantic efforts of\r\nthe Allies to open them are the plainest evidence of its importance.\r\n\r\nThe attempt in March to force the straits by naval power having\r\nresulted in failure, an army was landed on the west coast of\r\nGallipoli, and after heavy fighting established itself on a line\r\nrunning from Eski-Hissarlik on the south coast of the peninsula to the\r\nregion of Sari-Bair, on the north coast, constituting a front of\r\napproximately twenty miles, within five miles of the west coast. No\r\nprogress further than this have the Allies been able to make up to the\r\npresent, and the watch at the Dardanelles stands firm as yet.\r\n\r\nThe attacks of the Anglo-French armies, however, exerted influence on\r\nTurkey's operations in other fields of action. They caused the\r\ncomplete abandonment of a contemplated invasion of Egypt and compelled\r\nthe Turkish troops to go on the defensive in the Caucasian seat of\r\nwar. This enabled Russia to call back to Poland troops sorely needed\r\nthere, with which they had had to check the Turkish advance on Kars in\r\nJanuary. Since February both battlelines along the Caucasian front\r\nhave been weakened and no fighting of any consequence has occurred in\r\nthis campaign of merely secondary importance.\r\n\r\nThe operations in the latest field of action, along the Austro-Italian\r\nfrontier, have been going on for but eight weeks, and do not,\r\ntherefore, allow any conclusions as to their importance to be made as\r\nyet. So far the Italians have been unable to make any effective\r\nimpression on either Austria's Tyrolese frontier or on the front of\r\nthe Isonzo. All attempts to break through the Austrian lines have thus\r\nfar failed. The aim of Austria's strategy is to maintain a deadlock\r\nuntil the issue has been decided in Poland.\r\n\r\nIn determining the results of the first year of the world war the\r\nquestion as to which side is holding the advantage at the close of\r\nthis important period depends entirely upon what were the political\r\naims of the adversaries. The Teutonic allies' contention has ever\r\nbeen, rightly or wrongly, that they are not waging a war for\r\nterritorial aggrandizement, but purely one in self-defense. From this\r\npoint of view they can be well satisfied with the results they have so\r\nfar attained.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn American View\r\n\r\nBy the Military Expert of The New York Times\r\n\r\nFIRST PHASE\r\n\r\nOpening the Way to France Through Belgium\r\n\r\nBy Aug. 4, 1914, war had been declared by all the nations now engaged\r\nexcept Turkey and Italy. Subsequent events have proved that of them\r\nall the Teutonic allies were the only nations actually prepared and\r\nthat as between Austria and Germany the preparation of the latter was\r\nmuch more complete. It was the Germans, therefore, who, with the\r\nentire campaign carefully mapped out in advance, took the initiative.\r\nGermany, too, at the very outset saw the one clear path to victory.\r\n\r\nOne or the other of her Continental enemies must not only be defeated,\r\nbut crushed and eliminated from the conflict before the other could\r\nmobilize against her. One of them, Russia, would probably take the\r\nlonger time to effect her mobilization. Russia had started, it is\r\ntrue, before war was declared. But interior railroads in Russia are\r\nfew. Russia, too, is proverbially slow, if for no other reason than by\r\nvirtue of her ponderous numbers. France, on the other hand, is checked\r\nand counter-checked by good strategic railroads, and, having no such\r\nvast territory over which her troops would have to be moved, would be\r\nable to mobilize in a much shorter time than her ally. England, for a\r\nfew weeks at least, could be disregarded. Deceived as to the extent of\r\nRussian unpreparedness and believing that Russia's slowness would\r\nprevent an active offense for some weeks, Germany selected France as\r\nher first objective, and took immediate steps to hurl twenty-four army\r\ncorps across the French border at various points, aiming at Paris.\r\n\r\nThese twenty-four corps were divided into three armies--the Army of\r\nthe Meuse, based on Cologne; the Army of the Moselle, based on Metz\r\nand Coblenz, and the Army of the Rhine, based on Strassburg. All of\r\nthese three armies were naturally to converge on Paris. The route of\r\nthe Army of the Meuse would pass through Liege, Namur, and Maubeuge,\r\nand would therefore have to cross a part of Belgium; the Army of the\r\nMoselle would take a route through Sedan and Soissons, passing north\r\nof the Verdun fortress, but of necessity crossing the Duchy of\r\nLuxemburg; the Army of the Rhine, after crossing the screen of the\r\nVosges Mountains, would pass through Nancy and Toul, between the\r\nfortresses of Epinal and Belfort.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the march to Paris would be most quickly achieved\r\nthrough the flat country of Belgium, where the French frontier is\r\npractically unguarded and only the weakly manned barrier fortresses of\r\nBelgium barred the way. The remainder of the French frontier from\r\nLuxemburg to Switzerland was well fortified, and Germany had no time\r\nto spend in reducing fortified places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS A. EDISON\r\n\r\nThe American Inventor, Now Associated With the Navy Department as\r\nChief of the Advisory Board of Civilian Inventors and Engineers]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUDSON MAXIM\r\n\r\nAmerican Inventor of High Explosives and Other Materials of War\r\n\r\n(_Photo by White._)]\r\n\r\nThe main advance was therefore to take place through Belgium, the Army\r\nof the Moselle co-operating, while to the Army of the Rhine was\r\nassigned the offensive-defensive role of advancing to the barrier\r\nfortresses of Epinal and Belfort to check any French advance that\r\nmight be directed against the communications of the Armies of the\r\nMoselle and the Meuse to the north. The railroad communications\r\nthrough the Belgian plain were splendidly adapted to this plan, backed\r\nas they were by the military railroads which Germany had constructed\r\nseveral years before, running through the industrial districts in the\r\nnorth of the German Empire up to the Belgian border.\r\n\r\nGermany's first move was the invasion of Luxemburg, violating the\r\nneutrality of a State which, under the treaty making her independent\r\nand guaranteeing neutrality, (to which treaty Germany was a party,)\r\nwas not permitted to maintain an army. Two days later Germany asked\r\npassage for her troops through Belgium, for the purpose of attacking\r\nFrance. Belgium promptly refused, and on Aug. 4 Germany began the\r\nforcing of this passage by an attack on Liege.\r\n\r\nThus, at the outset the German plan went awry. Although the\r\ncontemplated line of advance was through Liege and Namur, it was not\r\nsufficient, with Belgium openly in arms to defend her country, to\r\nreduce only these two towns. The Belgian Army could, and later did,\r\nfall back to the north on Louvain, Brussels, and Antwerp, and so be\r\ndirectly on the German flank and in a position to strike at the line\r\nof communications. It was therefore necessary to subjugate all of\r\nBelgium either by destroying the Belgian Army or driving it before\r\nthem in their advance.\r\n\r\nThus, the German advance was not only doomed to delay, but at least\r\n100,000 troops were needed to garrison a hostile country and to\r\nprotect the life lines running to the rear.\r\n\r\nThree days after the attack on Liege opened the Germans penetrated\r\nbetween the outer forts, their infantry advancing in close formation\r\nand sustaining enormous losses. But Liege was worth the price paid.\r\nSome of the forts held out for days, but were finally reduced by the\r\nfire of the 42-centimeter guns--the first of the German surprises. The\r\nBelgian garrison, however, had done its work. The German advance was\r\ndelayed for ten precious days, during which the first consignment of\r\nthe British expeditionary force had reached the Continent and France\r\nand Russia had largely completed their mobilization.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was realized that the unexpected Belgian resistance had\r\nretarded the German advance and in all probability had disarranged the\r\nGerman plan of campaign, the French, even before the guns of Liege had\r\ncooled, struck at Alsace, through the Belford Gap and over the Vosges\r\nMountains. At first this French offensive was successful. Points on\r\nthe Metz-Strassburg Railroad were taken and the town of Muelhausen\r\ncaptured. But almost before the news of success reached Paris the\r\nFrench had been defeated, not only in Alsace but also in Lorraine,\r\nwhence French troops had been sent to engage the German Army of the\r\nMoselle. The result was the retirement of the French to the line of\r\ntheir first defense--a line that had been prepared for just such an\r\nemergency during the years since 1871.\r\n\r\nWhile the German armies of the Moselle and of the Rhine were thus\r\noccupied in repelling the French advance the Army of the Meuse was\r\nforcing its way through Belgium. Throwing out a strong cavalry screen\r\nin its front, this army advanced through Tongres, St. Frond, Laugen,\r\nHaelen, and Terlemont, and finally confronted the Belgians on the line\r\nfrom Louvain to Namur. Fighting on this front filled almost a week,\r\nwhen the destruction of the fortifications of Namur forced the\r\nBelgians to fall back, pivoting on Louvain to the line from Louvain to\r\nWavre, the last line in front of Brussels. On Aug. 20 the Belgians\r\nwere defeated at Louvain and the Germans entered Brussels, the Belgian\r\nGovernment having previously retired to Antwerp. The first phase of\r\nthe German advance was thus completed and the way to France was open.\r\n\r\nSECOND PHASE\r\n\r\nFrom the Fall of Brussels to von Kluck's Retreat to the Aisne\r\n\r\nImmediately following the fall of Namur, which forced the Belgians to\r\ntake up the Louvain-Wavre line, the main German Army of the Meuse\r\nstarted for France, leaving possibly two army corps to drive the\r\nBelgians from Brussels and to protect their flank and their lines of\r\ncommunication. The German advance first came in contact with the\r\nFrench and British along a line from Mons to Charleroi, southwest of\r\nBrussels. The British were supposed to have been between two French\r\narmies, but for some reason the army which had been assigned to\r\nposition on the British left did not appear. Being outflanked, a\r\nretreat followed, the French being defeated at the same time at\r\nCharleroi. The German Army of the Moselle then attacked along the\r\nMeuse, and, being also successful, was on the flank and rear of the\r\nBritish and French retreating from Mons and Charleroi.\r\n\r\nThus a great enveloping movement was disclosed which for some days\r\ngave every evidence of being successful. It was defeated, however,\r\nentirely by the British, who, though outflanked and outnumbered three\r\nto one, fought steadily night and day for six days, their small force\r\nholding in complete check all of von Kluck's army corps. Retreat was\r\nof course inevitable, but the retreat was made in good order and with\r\nthe morale of the troops unshaken.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the German General Staff, which had confidently\r\nexpected to crush France before Russia could become a factor to be\r\nreckoned with, saw with alarm Russia pouring her troops into East\r\nPrussia in a drive against Koenigsberg, while in South Poland another\r\nRussian army was preparing a drive against Galicia, operating from the\r\nIvangorod-Rowno railroad. Germany saw the Austrians being defeated\r\neverywhere; Lemberg, the capital of Galicia, captured; Przemysl\r\nmasked, and the Russians fighting their way westward through Galicia\r\nbetween the Carpathians and the Vistula. But Austria's troubles at\r\nthis stage were her own. Germany had all she could do to turn back the\r\nRussian invasion of East Prussia.\r\n\r\nTo face the peril on her eastern borders Germany detached several army\r\ncorps--probably five--from the western front, with them reinforced\r\nher eastern army, and in a few days after their arrival inflicted a\r\ndisastrous defeat on the Russians at Tannenburg, driving them back\r\npractically to their own borders. But the damage had been done. The\r\narmies of the west had been weakened at a critical point, and General\r\nJoffre was given the opportunity he had been seeking since the\r\nbeginning of the war.\r\n\r\nThe French and British, whose retreat had carried them to the Marne,\r\nnow outnumbered the Germans, and, what is more important, were able to\r\nconcentrate their forces by calling in those troops who had been\r\nengaged in the counter-offensive in Alsace. Taking advantage of their\r\nsuperiority in numbers, the Allies took the offensive. Holding the\r\nGermans fast in the centre, the Paris garrison struck hurriedly\r\nnortheast toward Soisson with the idea of getting around von Kluck's\r\nflank. For several days it seemed that von Kluck and his army must be\r\ncaptured. But, moving north with great rapidity, abandoning much of\r\nhis artillery and supplies, he escaped the net Joffre had spread for\r\nhim, and anchored himself securely behind the Aisne. The great German\r\nmovement was thus brought to an abrupt halt, and they were now on the\r\ndefensive. Paris was saved. For ten days the Allies fought desperately\r\nto cross the Aisne and force von Kluck to continue his retreat. But\r\nfinally the effort was given up, and the two armies faced each other\r\nacross the Aisne deadlocked.\r\n\r\nThe Russians meanwhile had not been idle. Although their operations\r\nagainst the reinforced German Army had a negative result, against the\r\nAustrians in Galicia their success continued. Przemysl had not been\r\ntaken, but, hemming it in securely, the Russians passed on and took\r\nthe fortified town of Jaroslau, near the lower San. The menace of the\r\nRussian invasion of Galicia then became apparent. Galicia, with her\r\nwealth of oil and minerals, the fertile plains of Hungary just the\r\nother side of the Carpathians, Cracow, opening the gate to Breslau and\r\nBerlin--these were the things the Teutons stood in danger of losing,\r\nand it is not surprising that they viewed the Russian advance with\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nThere is but one more incident to record before closing what might\r\nwell be considered the second phase of the war. That is the fall of\r\nAntwerp. It was Belgium's final sacrifice on the altar of her national\r\nhonor. And no matter what our ancestry may be, nor how our sympathies\r\nmay lie, we cannot but reverence a people whose sense of national duty\r\nand honor is so high that they are willing to sacrifice and do\r\nsacrifice their all to maintain it.\r\n\r\nTHIRD PHASE\r\n\r\nFrom the Fall of Antwerp to the Beginning of the Battle for Warsaw\r\n\r\nWhen it became apparent to General French that the line of the Aisne,\r\nto which the Germans had retreated after the battle of the Marne, was\r\ntoo strong to be forced, he withdrew his troops, about 100,000 men,\r\nfrom the line, his place being filled by the French reserves. The\r\nobject of the withdrawal was another flanking movement against the\r\nGerman right. The idea seems to have been that by withdrawing and\r\nentraining at night the movement would be entirely concealed from the\r\nGermans until the British were actually in Belgium, and that an\r\nadvance along the left bank of the Scheldt would turn the flank of the\r\nwhole German army in France, compelling a general retreat. The\r\nmovement was discovered by German air scouts, however, and the troops\r\nthat had been before Antwerp met and checked the British, who took up\r\nfinally the line along the Yser Canal, through Ypres to La Bassee,\r\nopposed by three German army corps.\r\n\r\nBut one thing saved the British from another defeat and prevented a\r\nmore disastrous retreat than that from Mons and Charleroi. When the\r\nGermans took Antwerp the Belgian garrison of about 50,000 men escaped\r\nand by a brilliant retreat retired to a line from Nieuport to Dixmude.\r\nThey thus guarded the left flank of the British line and by a\r\nstubborn resistance prevented this flank from being turned and the\r\nBritish driven south toward Paris. Nothing else prevented Dunkirk,\r\nCalais, and Boulogne from falling into German hands at this time.\r\n\r\nAs it afterward turned out, the German plan, after the fall of\r\nAntwerp, was a sudden drive to Calais. The plan was conceived and the\r\nmovement begun at the same time General French put into execution his\r\nattempt to outflank the German position. These forces met on the\r\nYpres-La Bassee line, and both were halted. It was a fortuitous\r\nchance, then, that the Germans were held back from the coast, as well\r\nas deprived of an opportunity to strike at Paris from the north. For\r\nthree weeks the Germans battled fiercely, with almost total disregard\r\nfor the loss of life involved. Finally the attack died out, and with\r\nits death the whole line from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier\r\nsettled down to trench warfare.\r\n\r\nWhile the armies in the west were checking each other until the status\r\nof a \"stalemate\" had been reached, affairs in the eastern theatre had\r\nbeen moving rapidly. Persuaded by German money, a temptation the Turk\r\nhas ever been powerless to resist, Turkey late in October joined hands\r\nwith the Teutons and declared war on the Allies. The Japanese, who had\r\nat the outset joined hands with England, had, after a wonderful\r\ndefense by the Germans, taken the German Chinese city of Kiao-Chau.\r\nBut of more importance still was the activity of the opposing armies\r\nin Russia and in Galicia.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Fannenburg, in which Russia was defeated and\r\ndriven back to her own borders, the Germans invaded Suwalki Province\r\nin Northern Poland. The Russians again took the offensive, defeated\r\nthe Germans in the battle of Augustovo, and, pressing westward, again\r\nentered East Prussia in the region of the Mazurian Lakes. In this\r\nterritory a deadlock followed, both Russians and Germans remaining\r\nwith horns locked and unable to move until early Spring.\r\n\r\nIn Galicia, however, events moved with greater rapidity, and the\r\nresults were vastly more important. After the fall of Lemberg and\r\nJaroslau the Russians pressed forward across the San to Tarnow,\r\nmasking Przemysl on the way, and took up a line along the Dunajec to\r\nthe Carpathians and east through Galicia along the Dniester and the\r\nPruth to the Rumanian frontier, thus threatening not only the plains\r\nof Hungary, which lay just across the Carpathian summits, but also\r\nBukowina, the Crownland of Austria.\r\n\r\nAustria's plight was desperate, and German assistance was necessary.\r\nVon Hindenburg's first attack on Warsaw, the battle being called the\r\nbattle of the Vistula, was the answer. The Germans advanced against\r\nthe Russian centre, the Austrians against the left in Galicia. At\r\nfirst both were successful, but heavy Russian reinforcements succeeded\r\nin turning the German left, almost at the very gates of Warsaw. The\r\nGermans were forced to retreat, and fell back to their own borders.\r\nThe Austrians were at the same time compelled to retreat, due to the\r\nuncovering of their flank, and again Russia was in supreme control of\r\nGalicia as far west as Cracow. As the Germans retreated the Russians\r\nfollowed, and another invasion of Germany was threatened, and it was\r\nvon Hindenburg again who was to throw it back.\r\n\r\nThis he did, driving forward in three columns, two of which were\r\nintended to move against the Russian flanks. The Russian centre fell\r\nback to Lodz, but the right was still threatened. Again Russia\r\nassembled her reserves, and before von Hindenburg realized the\r\nsituation a Russian army was not only on his flank but in his rear. A\r\nretreat was necessary. The Germans, assisted by corps drawn from the\r\nwest, cut their way out and escaped from the Russian trap through the\r\nfailure of one of the Russian armies to co-operate in the movement in\r\ntime. But the German offense had failed and the effort had been\r\nterribly expensive.\r\n\r\nAnother offense was immediately planned--this time to move along the\r\nVistula and strike at Warsaw from the southwest. This also was a\r\nfailure, and the two armies finally became deadlocked along the line\r\nof the Bzura and the Rawka Rivers.\r\n\r\nNo further fighting of importance in this theatre until February, when\r\nthe battle of the Mazurian Lakes was fought. It will be recalled that\r\nafter the German defeat at Augustovo the Russians pursued the Germans\r\ninto the lake district, where the two armies became practically\r\ndeadlocked. This situation was broken by the Germans, who suddenly\r\nattacked both flanks of the Russian army and inflicted upon it a\r\ndisastrous defeat, in which one army corps surrendered and the\r\nremainder escaped only after enormous losses.\r\n\r\nBut the victory, like other German victories, while decisive as far as\r\nthe particular Russian army involved was concerned, did nothing toward\r\nhastening peace. The beginning of Spring found the armies in both\r\ntheatres completely at a standstill, except in Galicia.\r\n\r\nIn the west since the failure of the German drive on Calais there has\r\nbeen no movement that has affected the general situation. The\r\nanniversary of the declaration of war finds the lines of the Germans\r\nand the French practically where they were six months ago. A number of\r\nbattles have been fought for the possession of certain points of\r\nvantage--in the Champagne, the Argonne, at Neuve Chapelle, Ypres, Les\r\nEparges, Hartmannsweilerkopf, Metzeral, Souchez--but they have\r\nresulted in only a local effect, although they have been accompanied\r\nin almost every case by losses that have been staggering.\r\n\r\nThe principal event of the Spring in the west has been the advent of\r\nItaly into the maelstrom. But this has not affected the situation up\r\nto the present time. Italy has a hard problem on her hands which must\r\nbe solved before she can make herself felt. She has but one line of\r\nadvance--the line of the Isonzo. But she dare not advance and leave\r\nthe passes through the Tyrolean and the Carnic Alps open for Germany\r\nand Austria to pour troops in against her flank and rear. Her task\r\ntherefore is first to stop every pass by which this can be done; and\r\nthen, and then only, is she ready to move. This is being done, but\r\nthe task is a difficult one, the country impossible from a military\r\nviewpoint, and progress necessarily slow.\r\n\r\nIn the east, however, the coming of Spring brought a series of the\r\nmost tremendous movements of the war. The Allies began an operation\r\nagainst the Dardanelles, with the object of forcing the strait, taking\r\nConstantinople, and thus at once releasing the great store of grain in\r\nSouthern Russia and providing a means of getting ammunition to Russia\r\nfrom the west. The operations at first were entirely naval. But after\r\nserious loss, with no corresponding advantage, it was realized that\r\nthe naval forces alone were not sufficient, and troops were landed on\r\nthe western end of the Gallipoli Peninsula. This force has been for\r\nthree months hammering at the positions of the Turks along the\r\nAchibaba line, but, except for the possible influence on the Balkan\r\nStates of the presence of these expeditionary forces on Gallipoli,\r\nlittle headway has been made. Certain it is that there is no\r\nindication that the near future will bring the Allies into\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nIn Galicia the Spring began with the capitulation of Przemysl and the\r\nsurrender to the Russians of about 125,000 Austrians. This was the\r\ngreatest victory in the eastern theatre thus far, and immediately\r\nopened the way wide to the passes in the Carpathians that led to the\r\nHungarian plains and to Cracow. Russia evidently felt that if she\r\nconfined her operations to Austria she could, by pushing the attack\r\ninto Hungary, crush Austria completely and eliminate her from the war.\r\nAccordingly, the opportunity of laying siege to Cracow was passed by\r\nand Russian efforts concentrated in forcing the Carpathian passes.\r\n\r\nFor weeks the battle of the Carpathians was in progress. The\r\nAustrians, reinforced by strong German contingents, fought\r\ndesperately, and, although several of the passes were finally\r\ncaptured, Uzok Pass, the centre of the line and the key to the whole\r\nCarpathian situation, held out. While the battle for its possession\r\nwas in progress the Germans were quietly concentrating along the\r\nDunajec. Suddenly their attack was launched, the line of the Dunajec\r\nforced, and the Russian flank and their lines of communication were\r\nseriously involved. To prevent being cut off, the forces in the\r\nCarpathians were compelled to fall back to their lateral lines.\r\nPreponderance of artillery forced the retreat through Galicia, and in\r\nan incredibly short time Jaroslaw, Przemysl, and Lemberg were again in\r\nthe hands of the Teutons and Galicia practically cleared of the\r\nRussian invaders.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the Spring the Germans under von Buelow had landed in\r\nNorthern Russia and the Gulf of Riga, and, gradually working south,\r\nhad effected a junction with von Hindenburg's army in front of Warsaw.\r\nComing north through Galicia, Mackensen had driven the Russians back\r\nto the line of the Ivangorod-Lublin railroad and had established\r\nconnections with von Hindenburg's right. Von Linsengen and the\r\nAustrian Archduke Francis Joseph completed the line facing the\r\nRussians along the upper Viprez, the Bug, the Flota Lipa, and the\r\nDniester. Simultaneously, with all flanks guarded, the Teutons began\r\nto close in on Warsaw in the most stupendous military movement of\r\nhistory. As this article is written it seems that nothing can save the\r\nPolish capital; before it goes to press, even Warsaw may be in German\r\nhands. One thing is evident--the Kaiser has returned to his plan of a\r\nyear ago--Napoleon's plan--the only plan that can succeed--completely\r\nto crush one opponent first and then turn against the other; only now\r\nit is Russia and not France upon which the blows are falling.\r\n\r\n     NOTE: A military review of the European warfare during\r\n     August will appear in the next number of CURRENT HISTORY, in\r\n     connection with the Chronology.--[_Editor_, CURRENT\r\n     HISTORY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInferences from Eleven Months of the European Conflict\r\n\r\nBy Charles W. Eliot, President Emeritus of Harvard University\r\n\r\n\r\nAsticou, Maine, July 16, 1915.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the New York Times:_\r\n\r\nThe inferences of the first importance are military and naval. In the\r\nconduct of war on land it has been demonstrated during the past eleven\r\nmonths that success in battle depends primarily on the possession and\r\nskillful use of artillery and machine guns. The nation which can\r\ncommand the largest quantity of artillery in great variety of calibre\r\nand range, has developed the amplest and quickest means of\r\ntransporting artillery and supplies of all sorts, and whose troops can\r\nuse mortars, howitzers, and cannon at the highest speed and with the\r\ngreatest accuracy will have important advantages over an enemy less\r\nwell provided, or less skillful. Before every assault by infantry\r\nartillery must sweep and plow the position to be captured, and so soon\r\nas the enemy has lost a trench or a redoubt the enemy's artillery will\r\ntry to destroy the successful troops with shell and shrapnel, before\r\nthe enemy's infantry makes a counter-attack. Whenever troops have open\r\nground to cross before they reach the intrenchments of the enemy, they\r\nencounter a withering fire from machine guns, which is so effective\r\nthat assaults over open ground have, for the most part, to be\r\nundertaken at night or in fog, or by some sort of surprise.\r\n\r\nIn general the defense has great advantage over the attack, as regards\r\nexpenditure of both men and munitions. So decided is the advantage of\r\nthe defense, that Germany can dismiss all those apprehensions about\r\ninvasion by the Russian hordes with which she set out on this war.\r\nSuccess in military movements on a large scale depends on the means of\r\ntransportation at hand; and these means of transportation must include\r\nrailroads, automobiles, and horse wagons, the function of the\r\nautomobile being of high importance wherever the roads are tolerably\r\ngood. There is little use for cavalry in the new fighting; for\r\naeroplanes can do better scouting and more distant raiding than\r\ncavalry ever could, and large bodies of infantry with their\r\nindispensable supplies can be moved faster and further by automobiles\r\nthan cavalry could ever be.\r\n\r\nThe aeroplane also defeats the former use of cavalry to screen from\r\nthe enemy's view the movements of troops and their trains behind the\r\nactual fronts. Moreover, cavalry cannot stand at all against the new\r\nartillery and the machine gun. An old-fashioned cavalry charge in the\r\nopen is useless, and indeed impossible. Aerial warfare is still\r\nundeveloped, but the war has proved that the aeroplane, even in its\r\npresent imperfect condition, is a useful instrument. The Zeppelin, on\r\nthe other hand, seems to be too fragile and too unmanageable for\r\neffective use in war. Rifle fire is of far less importance than\r\nartillery and machine gun fire; and, indeed, the abandonment of the\r\nrifle as the principal arm for infantry is clearly suggested.\r\n\r\nElaborate forts made of iron and concrete are of little use against a\r\ncompetent invader, and fortifications round about cities are of no use\r\nfor protection against an enemy that possesses adequate artillery. For\r\nthe defense of a frontier, or of the approaches to a railroad junction\r\nor a city, a system of trenches is immeasurably superior to forts,\r\nparticularly if behind the trenches a network of railways or of smooth\r\nhighways exists. Wounds are often inflicted by jagged pieces of metal\r\nwhich carry bits of dirty clothing and skin into the wounds, and the\r\nwounded often lie on the ground for hours or even days before aid can\r\nreach them. Hence the surgery of this war is largely the surgery of\r\ninfected wounds, and not of smooth aseptic cuts and holes. A\r\nconsiderable percentage of deaths and permanent disabilities among the\r\nwounded is the inevitable result. Surgeons and dressers are more\r\nexposed to death and wounds than in former wars, because of the large\r\nuse of artillery of long range, the field hospitals being often under\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nFrom these changes in the methods of war on land it may be safely\r\ninferred that a nation which would be strong in war on land must be\r\nstrong in all sorts of manufacturing, and particularly in the\r\nmetallurgical industries. A nation chiefly devoted to agriculture and\r\nthe ancient trades cannot succeed in modern war, unless it can beg,\r\nborrow, or buy from sympathizers or allies the necessary artillery and\r\nmunitions. No amount of courage and devotion in troops can make up for\r\nan inadequate supply of artillery, machine guns, shells, and shrapnel,\r\nor for the lack of ample means of rapid transportation. Only in a\r\nrough country without good roads, like the United States in 1861-65,\r\nor Serbia or Russia now, can the rifle, light artillery, and horse or\r\nox wagons win any considerable success; and in such a country the\r\ntrench method can bring about a stalemate, if the combatants are well\r\nmatched in strength, diligence, and courage.\r\n\r\nThe changes in naval warfare are almost equally remarkable. Mines and\r\nsubmarines can make the offensive operation of dreadnoughts and\r\ncruisers near ports practically impossible, and can inflict great\r\ndamage on an enemy's commerce. Hence important modifications in the\r\nrules concerning effective blockade. In squadron actions victory will\r\nprobably go to the side which has the gun of longest range\r\nwell-manned. Defeated war vessels sink as a rule with almost all on\r\nboard. Commercial vessels can seldom be taken into port as prizes, and\r\nmust therefore be sunk to make their capture effective. There have\r\nbeen no actions between large fleets; but the indications are that a\r\ndefeated fleet would be sunk for the most part, the only vessels to\r\nescape being some of the speedier sort. Crews would go down with their\r\nvessels. Shore batteries of long-range guns can keep at a distance a\r\nconsiderable fleet, and can sink vessels that come too near. Mines and\r\nshore batteries together can prevent the passage of war vessels\r\nthrough straits ten to fifteen miles wide, no matter how powerful the\r\nvessel's batteries may be. Every war vessel is now filled with\r\nmachinery of various sorts, much of which is delicate or easily\r\ndisabled. Hence a single shell exploding violently in a sensitive spot\r\nmay render a large ship unmanageable, and therefore an easy victim. A\r\ncrippled ship will probably be sunk, unless a port is near.\r\n\r\nTo build and keep in perfect condition a modern fleet requires\r\ndockyards and machine shops of large capacity, and great metallurgical\r\nindustries always in operation within the country which maintains the\r\nfleet. No small nation can create a powerful fleet; and no nation\r\nwhich lives chiefly by agriculture can maintain one. A great naval\r\npower must be a mining, manufacturing, and commercial power, with a\r\nsound banking system available all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe war has proved that it is possible for a combination of strong\r\nnaval powers to sweep off the ocean in a few months all the warships\r\nof any single great power, except submarines, and all its commerce.\r\nGermany has already suffered that fate, and incidentally the loss of\r\nall her colonies, except portions of German East Africa and Kamerun,\r\nboth of which remnants are vigorously assailed and will soon be lost.\r\nNevertheless, she still exports and imports through neutral countries,\r\nthough to a small amount in comparison with the volume of her normal\r\ntrade. Here is another illustration of the general truth that colonies\r\nare never so good to trade with as independent and prosperous nations.\r\n\r\nAgain the war has proved that it is not possible in a normal year to\r\nreduce by blockade or non-intercourse the food supply of a large\r\nnation to the point of starvation, or even of great distress, although\r\nthe nation has been in the habit of importing a considerable fraction\r\nof its food supply. An intelligent population will make many economies\r\nin its food, abstain from superfluities, raise more food from its\r\nsoil, use grains for food instead of drinks, and buy food from neutral\r\ncountries so long as its hard money holds out. Any large country which\r\nhas a long seaboard or neutral neighbors can probably prevent its\r\nnoncombatant population from suffering severely from want of food or\r\nclothing while at war. This would not be true of the districts in\r\nwhich actual fighting takes place or over which armies pass; for in\r\nthe regions of actual battle modern warfare is terribly\r\ndestructive--as Belgium, Northern France, Poland, and Serbia know.\r\n\r\nA manufacturing people whose commercial vessels are driven off the\r\nseas will, of course, suffer the loss of such raw materials of its\r\nindustries as habitually came to it over seas in its own bottoms--a\r\nloss mitigated, however, by the receipt of some raw materials from or\r\nthrough neutral countries. This abridgment of its productive\r\nindustries will, in the long run, greatly diminish its powers of\r\nresistance in war; but much time may be needed for the full\r\ndevelopment of this serious disability.\r\n\r\nBecause of the great costliness of the artillery, munitions of war,\r\nand means of transportation used in the present war, the borrowings of\r\nall the combatant nations are heavy beyond any precedent; so that\r\nalready all the nations involved have been compelled to raise the\r\nrates of interest on the immense loans they have put upon the market.\r\nThe burdens thus being prepared for the coming generations in the\r\nbelligerent nations will involve very high rates of taxation in all\r\nthe countries now at war. If these burdens continue to accumulate for\r\ntwo or three years more, no financier, however experienced and\r\nfar-seeing, can imagine today how the resulting loans are to be paid\r\nor how the burden of taxation necessary to pay the interest on them\r\ncan be borne or how the indemnities probably to be exacted can be paid\r\nwithin any reasonable period by the defeated nation or nations.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these established facts that a small nation--a nation\r\nof not more than fifteen millions, for example--can have no\r\nindependent existence in Europe except as a member of a federation of\r\nStates having similar habits, tendencies, and hopes, and united in an\r\noffensive and defensive alliance, or under guarantees given by a group\r\nof strong and trustworthy nations. The firm establishment of several\r\nsuch federations, or the giving of such guarantees by a group of\r\npowerful and faith-keeping nations ought to be one of the outcomes of\r\nthe war of 1914-15. Unless some such arrangement is reached, no small\r\nState will be safe from conquest and absorption by any strong,\r\naggressive military power which covets it--not even if its people live\r\nchiefly by mining and manufacturing as the Belgians did.\r\n\r\nThe small States, being very determined to exist and to obtain their\r\nnatural or historical racial boundaries, the problem of permanent or\r\nany durable peace in Europe resolves itself into this: How can the\r\nsmall or smaller nations be protected from attack by some larger\r\nnation which believes that might makes right and is mighty in\r\nindustries, commerce, finance, and the military and naval arts? The\r\nexperience gained during the past year proves that there is but one\r\neffective protection against such a power, namely, a firm league of\r\nother powers--not necessarily numerous--which together are stronger in\r\nindustries, commerce, finance, and the military and naval arts than\r\nthe aggressive and ambitious nation which heartily believes in its own\r\ninvincibility and cherishes the ambition to conquer and possess.\r\n\r\nSuch a league is the present combination of Great Britain, France,\r\nRussia, Italy, and Japan against the aggressive Central Monarchies and\r\nTurkey; but this combination was not formed deliberately and with\r\nconscious purpose to protect small States, to satisfy natural\r\nnational aspirations, and to make durable peace possible by removing\r\nboth fear of invasion and fear of the cutting off of overseas food and\r\nraw materials. In spite of the lack of an explicit and comprehensive\r\npurpose to attain these wise and precious ends, the solidity of the\r\nalliance during a year of stupendous efforts to resist military\r\naggression on the part of Germany and Austria-Hungary certainly\r\naffords good promise of success for a somewhat larger league in which\r\nall the European nations--some, like the Scandinavian and the Balkans,\r\nby representation in groups--and the United States should be included.\r\nSuch a league would have to act through a distinct and permanent\r\ncouncil or commission which would not serve arbitrary power, or any\r\npeculiar national interest, and would not in the least resemble the\r\n\"Concert of Europe,\" or any of the disastrous special conferences of\r\ndiplomatists and Ministers for Foreign Affairs, called after wars\r\nsince that of 1870-71 to \"settle\" the questions the wars raised.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the past twelve months proves that such a league\r\ncould prevent any nation which disobeyed its orders from making use of\r\nthe oceans and from occupying the territory of any other nation.\r\nReduction of armaments, diminution of taxation, and durable peace\r\nwould ensue as soon as general confidence was established that the\r\nleague would fairly administer international justice, and that its\r\nmilitary and naval forces were ready and effective. Its function would\r\nbe limited to the prevention and punishment of violation of\r\ninternational agreements, or, in other words, to the enforcement of\r\ntreaty obligations, until new treaties were made.\r\n\r\nThe present alliance is of good promise in three important\r\nrespects--its members refuse to make any separate peace, they\r\nco-operate cordially and efficiently in military measures, and the\r\nricher members help the poorer financially. These policies have been\r\nhastily devised and adopted in the midst of strenuous fighting on an\r\nimmense scale. If deliberately planned and perfected in times of\r\npeace, they could be made in the highest degree effective toward\r\ndurable peace.\r\n\r\nThe war has demonstrated that the international agreements for the\r\nmitigation of the horrors of war, made by treaties, conferences, and\r\nconventions in times of peace, may go for nothing in time of war;\r\nbecause they have no sanction, or, in other words, lack penalties\r\ncapable of systematic enforcement. To provide the lacking sanction and\r\nthe physical force capable of compelling the payment of penalties for\r\nviolating international agreements would be one of the best functions\r\nof the international council which the present alliance foreshadows.\r\nSome years would probably be required to satisfy the nations concerned\r\nthat the sanction was real and the force trustworthy and sufficient.\r\nThe absolute necessity of inventing and applying a sanction for\r\ninternational law, if Europe is to have international peace and any\r\nnational liberty, will be obvious to any one who has once perceived\r\nthat the present war became inevitable when Austria-Hungary, in\r\nviolation of an international agreement to which she was herself a\r\nparty, seized and absorbed Bosnia and Herzegovina, and became general\r\nand fierce when Germany, under Prussian lead, in violation of an\r\ninternational agreement to which she was herself a party, entered and\r\nplundered neutralized Belgium.\r\n\r\nA strong, trustworthy international alliance to preserve the freedom\r\nof the seas under all circumstances would secure for Great Britain and\r\nher federated commonwealths everything secured by the burdensome\r\ntwo-navies policy which now secures the freedom of the seas for\r\nBritish purposes. The same international alliance would secure for\r\nGermany the same complete freedom of the seas which in times of peace\r\nbetween Germany and Great Britain she has long enjoyed by favor of\r\nGreat Britain, but has lost in time of war with the Triple Entente.\r\nThis security, with the general acceptance of the policy of the \"open\r\ndoor,\" would fully meet Germany's need of indefinite expansion for her\r\nmanufacturing industries and her commerce, and of room \"in the sun\"\r\nfor her surplus population.\r\n\r\nIt is a safe inference from the events of the past six months that the\r\nlonger the war lasts the more significant will be the political and\r\nsocial changes which result from it. It is not to be expected, and\r\nperhaps not to be desired, that the ruling class in the countries\r\nautocratically governed should themselves draw this inference at\r\npresent, but all lovers of freedom and justice will find consolation\r\nfor the prolongation of the war in this hopeful reflection.\r\n\r\nTo devise the wise constitution of an international council or\r\ncommission with properly limited powers, and to determine the most\r\npromising composition of an international army and an international\r\nnavy are serious tasks, but not beyond the available international\r\nwisdom and goodwill, provided that the tasks be intrusted to\r\ninternational publicists, business men of large experience, and\r\nsuccessful administrators, rather than to professional diplomatists\r\nand soldiers. To dismiss such a noble enterprise with the remark that\r\nit is \"academic,\" or beyond the reach of \"practical\" politics, is\r\nunworthy of courageous and humane men; for it seems now to be the only\r\nway out of the horrible abyss into which civilization has fallen. At\r\nany rate, some such machinery must be put into successful operation\r\nbefore any limitation of national armaments can be effected. The war\r\nhas shown to what a catastrophe competitive national arming has led,\r\nand would probably again lead the most civilized nations of Europe.\r\nShall the white race despair of escaping from this hell? The only way\r\nof escape in sight is the establishment of a rational international\r\ncommunity. Should the enterprise fail after fair trial, the world will\r\nbe no worse off than it was in July, 1914, or is today.\r\n\r\nWhoever studies the events of the past year with some knowledge of\r\npolitical philosophy and history, and with the love of his neighbor in\r\nhis heart, will discover, amid the horrors of the time and its moral\r\nchaos, three hopeful leadings for humanitarian effort, each involving\r\na great constructive invention. He will see that humanity needs\r\nsupremely a sanction for international law, rescue from alcoholism,\r\nand a sound basis for just and unselfish human relations in the great\r\nindustries, and particularly in the machinery industries. The war has\r\nbrought out all three of these needs with terrible force and\r\nvividness. Somehow they must be met, if the white race is to succeed\r\nin \"the pursuit of happiness,\" or even to hold the gains already made.\r\n\r\nCHARLES W. ELIOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Revenge for Elisabeth!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Vienna \"Arbeiter Zeitung\" of June 22, 1915, prints the appeal of\r\nDr. Wolfgang Madjera, a well-known authority on municipal affairs,\r\nwhich he has issued to Austrian soldiers departing for the Italian\r\nfront. He says:_\r\n\r\n\"The day has arrived,\" says Herr Madjera, \"when you will have to\r\nrevenge your murdered Empress [the late Empress Elisabeth who was\r\nmurdered in Geneva by an Italian named Luccheni]. It was a son of that\r\nland which has now committed a scandalous act of treason on Austria\r\nwho made your old Emperor a lonely man on his throne of thorns. Take a\r\nthousandfold revenge on the brethren of that miserable wretch.\r\nAustria's warriors feel the strength within them to defeat and smash\r\nwith iron hand the raised hand of the murderer. It is Luccheni's\r\nspirit which leads the army of our enemy. May Elisabeth's spirit lead\r\nour spirit!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Year of the War in Africa and Asia\r\n\r\nBy Charles Johnston\r\n\r\n\r\nI. RE-MAPPING THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on July 14, A. Bonar Law, British Colonial Secretary,\r\nannounced that the Entente Allies have already occupied 450,000 square\r\nmiles of German colonial possessions. Add Turkish possessions in Asia\r\nin the hands of the Entente powers, and the total reaches 500,000\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\nTwo outstanding facts are that this transfer, if permanent, will\r\nchange the destiny of all Africa and Asia, and that, for the first\r\ntime in history, the oversea dominions of Britain have initiated and\r\ncarried on wars of conquest, Australia and New Zealand, in union,\r\nhaving already taken 100,000 square miles of German colonies in the\r\nPacific; while the Union of South Africa has conquered German\r\nSouthwest Africa.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of Africa, France and Belgium are co-operating with\r\nEnglish imperial forces, while in East Africa and on the Persian Gulf\r\nthe brunt of the fighting is being borne by British Indian troops and\r\ntroops provided by the Princes of India. The movement now in progress\r\nwill, if completed, give the Entente powers the whole of Africa; will\r\ngive Britain all Southern Asia, from the Mount Sinai peninsula to\r\nSiam; and will, in all probability, make the Entente powers heirs of\r\nthe whole Eastern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThese immense territories are the ultimate stakes of the battles in\r\nFrance, in Poland, on the Dardanelles. We lose sight of them, perhaps,\r\nin the details of local fighting. In reality, nothing less is being\r\neffected than the re-mapping of the whole eastern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. TOGOLAND AND KAMERUN.\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 1, a year ago, German colonial possessions in Africa totaled\r\nover a million square miles, in four regions--Togo, Kamerun, Southwest\r\nAfrica, and East Africa. Togo, running from the north shore of the\r\nGulf of Guinea, is wedged between French and English colonies. In\r\nAugust, France and England joined in attacking it, and on Aug. 26\r\ntheir occupation was complete, a rich area of 33,000 square miles thus\r\npassing from Germany to the Entente powers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Togo, the German Colony which was surrendered to a\r\nFranco-English expeditionary force.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: German East Africa\r\n\r\nScene of Operation of Anglo-French forces against the German Colony of\r\nKamerun]\r\n\r\nKamerun, in the elbow of the Gulf of Guinea, is about ten times as\r\nlarge, one-third of this having been conceded by France to Germany in\r\n1911, through the agency of M. Caillaux. Recent letters to The\r\nLondon Times describe the fighting there:\r\n\r\n     On the 7th (May) we had a trying experience. Our company\r\n     commander went out with myself and another subaltern and\r\n     about forty men. We crossed the Mungo River in canoes, and\r\n     then did a long and very difficult march all through the\r\n     night in absolute dense forest. However the guides managed\r\n     it passes comprehension.\r\n\r\n     About 5 in the morning, when it was just getting light, our\r\n     advance party were just on the point of stumbling on to the\r\n     German outpost, when what should happen but an elephant\r\n     suddenly walked in between and scattered our opposing\r\n     parties in all directions. I was in the rear of our little\r\n     column, and was left in bewilderment, all our carriers\r\n     dropping their loads and every one disappearing into the\r\n     bush. After a few minutes we got our men together and our\r\n     scouts went forward again, and found the Germans had bolted\r\n     from their outpost, but soon returned and opened fire on our\r\n     scouts.\r\n\r\nA British officer writes:\r\n\r\n     I hope you have heard ere this of our capture of Duala and\r\n     Bonaberi, and our further advance along the Duala Railway to\r\n     Tusa, and along the Wari River to Jabassi. The heat and\r\n     climate are very trying. It's awfully hot, far hotter than\r\n     the last coast place I was in; a drier heat and sun\r\n     infinitely more powerful, and yet the rains are full on and\r\n     we get terrific tornadoes. The nights, however, are cooler.\r\n\r\n     We are surrounded by mangrove swamps, and they breed\r\n     mosquitos, and consequently malaria and black-water fever.\r\n\r\n     This is quite a pretty little place (Duala) with some jolly\r\n     houses, typical German of the Schloss villa type; nice\r\n     inside and out. The country is pretty, the soil good. A good\r\n     deal of timber and rubber. I found some beautiful tusks the\r\n     other day, worth a good bit. Elephants abound. The native\r\n     villages around are totally different from other West\r\n     African ones--here their houses are mostly one long mud or\r\n     palm erection, with thatched roof, and are divided into\r\n     compartments instead of the smaller separate huts one is\r\n     accustomed to see in these parts.\r\n\r\n     The notices all over the place are strangely reminiscent of,\r\n     say, the Black Forest--\"Baekerei,\" \"Conditorei,\" &c., and yet\r\n     it is the heart of tropical Africa. None of the natives,\r\n     strange to say, talk German; all pigeon English. The Hausa\r\n     boys are splendid chaps, as different from the Duala boys or\r\n     Sierra Leone boys as chalk from cheese. Smile and make an\r\n     idiotic but beautiful remark, they rush with a roar of\r\n     laughter for the biggest load.\r\n\r\n     We get some beautiful sunset effects here. At sundown night\r\n     before last, on the sea near mouth of river, it was\r\n     absolutely gorgeous with the purple mountains standing\r\n     clear out against the orange and emerald sky and the dark\r\n     gray shapes of our ships lying sombrely in the background,\r\n     talking to each other in flashing Morse. The great mountain,\r\n     Fernando Po, standing up out of the water to starboard and\r\n     the Peak of Cameroon (13,760 feet) wreathed in mist to port;\r\n     Victoria invisible, as also Buea--both hidden behind the\r\n     clouds as we passed disdainfully by and entered the estuary\r\n     of the Cameroon River.\r\n\r\nAs an added detail for West Africa, it should be recorded that, on\r\nMarch 19, a combined French and Belgian force occupied Molundu in the\r\nGerman Congo territory, and Ngaundere on June 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. WITH BOTHA IN SOUTHWEST AFRICA.\r\n\r\nOn July 13 a resolution, moved by Premier Asquith, was passed by\r\nacclamation in the House of Commons thanking General Louis Botha,\r\nGeneral Smuts and the forces of the Union of South Africa for their\r\nwork in \"the remarkable campaign which has just been brought to a\r\nremarkable and glorious conclusion.\" Premier Asquith concluded:\r\n\r\n     The German dominion of Southwest Africa has ceased to exist.\r\n     I ask the House to testify to the admiration of the whole\r\n     empire for its gratitude to the illustrious General who has\r\n     rendered such an inestimable service to the empire, which he\r\n     entered by adoption and of which he has become one of the\r\n     most honored and cherished sons, and to his dauntless and\r\n     much enduring troops, whether of Burgher or British birth,\r\n     who fought like brethren, side by side, in the cause which\r\n     is equally dear to them as to us--the broadening of the\r\n     bounds of human liberty.\r\n\r\nThe event which the British Premier thus read into the minutes of\r\nhistory marks the end of a campaign begun by General Botha on Sept.\r\n27, when troops of the Union of South Africa first entered German\r\nterritory. On Christmas Day Walfisch (Whale) Bay was occupied, and on\r\nJan. 14 Swakopmund, a military railroad joining them being finished a\r\nmonth later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The German Colonial Possessions]\r\n\r\nThe progress of General Botha's campaign from the south and west is\r\nthus summarized by The Sphere (July 3):\r\n\r\n     The occupation of Windhoek was effected by General Botha's\r\n     North Damaraland forces working along the railway from\r\n     Swakopmund. At the former place General Vanderventer\r\n     joined up with General Botha's forces. The force from\r\n     Swakopmund met with considerable opposition, first at\r\n     Tretskopje, a small township in the great Namib Desert fifty\r\n     miles to the northeast of Swakopmund, and secondly at\r\n     Otjimbingwe, on the Swakop River, sixty miles northwest of\r\n     Windhoek.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: The theatre of operations in German South\r\n     West Africa.]\r\n\r\n     Apart from these two determined stands, however, little\r\n     other opposition was encountered, and Karibib was occupied\r\n     on May 5 and Okahandja and Windhoek on May 12. With the fall\r\n     of the latter place 3,000 Europeans and 12,000 natives\r\n     became prisoners.\r\n\r\n     The wireless station--one of Germany's most valuable\r\n     high-power stations, which was able to communicate with one\r\n     relay only with Berlin--was captured almost intact, and much\r\n     rolling stock also fell into the hands of the Union forces.\r\n\r\n     The advance from the south along the\r\n     Luederitzbucht-Seeheim-Keetmanshoop Railway, approximately\r\n     500 miles in length, was made by two forces which joined\r\n     hands at Keetmanshoop. The advance from Aus (captured on\r\n     April 1) was made by General Smuts's forces. Colonel\r\n     (afterward General) Vanderventer, moving up from the\r\n     direction of Warmbad and Kalkfontein, around the flanks of\r\n     Karas Mountain, pushed on after reaching Keetmanshoop in the\r\n     direction of Gibeon. Bethany had previously been occupied\r\n     during the advance to Seeheim. At Kabus, twenty miles to the\r\n     north of Keetmanshoop, and at Gibeon pitched battles were\r\n     fought between General Vanderventer's forces and the enemy.\r\n     No other opposition of importance was encountered, and the\r\n     operations were brought to a successful conclusion at\r\n     Windhoek.\r\n\r\nA part of the German forces had retreated to the northward, intending\r\nto carry on guerrilla warfare in the hills. General Botha went in\r\npursuit. A Reuter's telegram, dated June 26, announced that\r\nOtjivarongo, approximately 120 miles north of Karibib, on the Otavi\r\nRailway, was occupied on that day by General Botha, the enemy having\r\nretired northward during the previous night. General Botha's movements\r\nhave again been characterized by rapid and extraordinary marching\r\nthrough dense bush country, which is almost waterless. The retirement\r\nof the enemy was more suggestive of a flight than a strategic retreat.\r\n\r\nA telegram from Lord Buxton, the Governor General of the Union of\r\nSouth Africa, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, concludes\r\nthe story:\r\n\r\n     This morning, July 9, General Botha accepted from Governor\r\n     Seitz the surrender of all the German forces in Southwest\r\n     Africa. Hostilities have ceased and the campaign has thus\r\n     been brought to a successful conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe newly conquered territory, which is half as large again as the\r\nGerman Empire, is destined to become a part of the South African\r\nUnion. As a great part of it is 5,000 feet above sea level, it is well\r\nadapted for white settlers. Its chief resources are diamond mines and\r\ngrazing.\r\n\r\nGeneral Botha's force is likely to be divided between the European\r\nseat of war, to which the South African Union has up to the present\r\nsent no troops, and German East Africa, much of which still remains in\r\nthe hands of the Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. GERMAN EAST AFRICA.\r\n\r\nThe early stage of the struggle for German East Africa is lucidly\r\nsummarized in The Sphere for May 8:\r\n\r\n     The fighting in British East Africa (immediately north of\r\n     the German colony) may be said to have really begun toward\r\n     the end of September, 1914, when the Germans made a\r\n     determined attempt to capture Mombasa, the commercial\r\n     capital of British East Africa and the terminus of the\r\n     Uganda Railway.\r\n\r\n     Previous to this, somewhat half-hearted attempts had been\r\n     made by them to wreck the railway line at various points,\r\n     destroy the telegraph, and occupy Voi and Mombasa. The\r\n     Germans, who were in strong force, were, however, for\r\n     various reasons, unable to cut the railway or even to\r\n     destroy the bridge across the Tsava River, and they were\r\n     beaten back both at Voi and the post at Taveta.\r\n\r\n     The attack on Mombasa itself was repulsed at Gazi, some\r\n     twenty-five miles to the southwest. The German plan of\r\n     action was to move up the road from Vanga to Mombasa,\r\n     arriving at the latter place somewhere about the time the\r\n     Koenigsburg was expected to arrive and bombard it from the\r\n     sea. The Koenigsburg was, of course, prevented from doing\r\n     this by the proximity of British warships, and the land\r\n     attack was also frustrated.\r\n\r\n     The Germans were held at Nargerimi by a mere handful of\r\n     Arabs and King's African Rifles--about 300 men all\r\n     told--until the arrival of the Indian troops strengthened\r\n     our position and the enemy was beaten back to his original\r\n     lines.\r\n\r\n     The next big actions were the British attack on Tanga and\r\n     Jassin very early in November; this was the direct outcome\r\n     of the German attack on Mombasa. Tanga is a post of\r\n     considerable importance in German East Africa, and lies\r\n     midway between Zanzibar and Mombasa. It is the seaport of an\r\n     important railway line which connects it with Moshi, lying\r\n     among the foothills of Kilimanjaro (18,700 feet) and which\r\n     taps most of the intervening country.\r\n\r\n     The force dispatched for the attack on Tanga consisted of\r\n     4,000 Indian Imperial Service troops, 1,000 Indian regulars,\r\n     together with 1,000 white regulars. The force took no kit of\r\n     any kind except rations. It was disembarked from the\r\n     troopship near Tanga, and then moved against the position.\r\n\r\n     The day the British attacked, however, 1,000 Germans had\r\n     been rushed up from Moshi and then took up a position to the\r\n     right of the town. With them were great numbers of\r\n     quick-firing guns of various sorts. This unexpected\r\n     reinforcement made the capture of Tanga almost impossible by\r\n     the forces present. During the fight many casualties were\r\n     incurred on both sides.\r\n\r\n     As regards the advance against Tanga and Jassin, the German\r\n     forces which had previously advanced on Mombasa were, up to\r\n     as recently as January, maintaining themselves in the valley\r\n     of the Umba River. To drive them from their positions a\r\n     column of 1,800 men, composed of Indians and King's African\r\n     Rifles, with artillery, was dispatched.\r\n\r\n     After gaining Jassin and leaving a garrison of 300 men, the\r\n     post was attacked and subsequently surrendered to a force of\r\n     2,000 Germans. The minor operations along the\r\n     Anglo-German frontier include the attack on Shirati--a\r\n     German post on the southeast shore of Lake Victoria\r\n     Nyanza--on Jan. 9.\r\n\r\n     Fighting also took place near Karunga in March, and on this\r\n     occasion the German force was driven back in disorder and\r\n     with heavy loss into their own territory, while Kisu--which\r\n     had been captured by the Germans--was reoccupied after the\r\n     defeat of Karunga. On Jan. 10 the large Island of Mafia, off\r\n     the coast of the German colony, was taken by the British and\r\n     is being administered by them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR CECIL ARTHUR SPRING-RICE\r\n\r\nBritish Ambassador to Washington. Present When J.P. Morgan was\r\nAssaulted by Erich Muenter, Alias Holt]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J.P.

Photograph taken Immediately after his Arrest.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: German East Africa and the fighting which has taken\r\nplace.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the war in this region is brought up to date by a\r\nBritish Press Bureau statement issued on June 30:\r\n\r\n     Further details are now to hand of the operations which have\r\n     been taking place west of Lake Victoria Nyanza. It will be\r\n     remembered that the general scheme for the attack on Bukoba\r\n     was to be a simultaneous advance on the part of two forces,\r\n     one starting from the line of the Kagera River, south of\r\n     Uganda, the other starting on steamers from Kisumu.\r\n\r\n     The junction of the two forces was successfully\r\n     accomplished, and the attack took place on June 22. During\r\n     the action the enemy received reinforcements which brought\r\n     his force up to 400 rifles, and he made a most determined\r\n     resistance, the Arabs especially fighting most bravely. They\r\n     were, however, heavily outnumbered, and eventually the whole\r\n     force broke and fled, utterly demoralized.... Our troops\r\n     distinguished themselves greatly, both in the arduous march\r\n     from the Kagera and in the subsequent fighting. A telegram\r\n     was sent on June 28 from Lord Kitchener to Major Gen.\r\n     Tighe, commanding the troops in British East Africa,\r\n     congratulating him on the success of the operations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Conquered German African Territory.]\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE PERSIAN GULF AND MESOPOTAMIA.\r\n\r\nTurkey's entry into the war has had four results: 1, The annexation of\r\nCyprus (previously a protectorate) by Britain on Nov. 5; 2, the\r\nBritish expedition against Turkish territory on the Persian Gulf two\r\nweeks later; 3, the loss of Turkey's suzerainty over Egypt, which\r\nbecame a British protectorate under a Sultan on Dec. 17, and, 4, the\r\nattack on the Gallipoli Peninsula, still in progress.\r\n\r\nAn excellent summary of the Persian Gulf expedition is given in The\r\nSphere, May 15:\r\n\r\n     The Shatt-el-Arab, (the united Euphrates and Tigris,) for\r\n     the greater part of its course, forms the boundary between\r\n     Persia and Turkey. Some twenty miles below Basra (or\r\n     Bussorah) it is joined by the Kasun, near whose course,\r\n     about a hundred miles from its mouth, are the Anglo-Persian\r\n     Company's oil fields.\r\n\r\n     The effective protection of these is necessarily an object\r\n     of vital importance. It was also of considerable importance\r\n     to create a diversion which should cause the Osmanli\r\n     Generals to feel uneasiness as to a possible advance up the\r\n     Euphrates. Whether more than the occupation of Basra and the\r\n     protection of the oil fields was or is intended cannot, of\r\n     course, be at present definitely stated.\r\n\r\n     The expeditionary force, under Lieut. Gen. Sir Arthur\r\n     Barrett, consisted--apparently--of three Indo-British\r\n     infantry brigades, a brigade of Indian cavalry, and\r\n     artillery and auxiliary services in proportion--in all\r\n     probability some 15,000 to 18,000 men. It included at least\r\n     three British battalions--the Second Dorsets, the Second\r\n     Norfolks, and the Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry.\r\n\r\n     The advanced brigade reached the Shatt-el-Arab on Nov. 7,\r\n     and after a brief fight occupied Fao, a few miles up the\r\n     river. On the 9th a night attack was made upon it by a force\r\n     from Basra, which was easily beaten off. Shortly afterwards\r\n     the main body of the expeditionary force began to arrive,\r\n     and by the 16th it had entirely disembarked at Saniyeh, a\r\n     place above Fao.\r\n\r\n     The weather was wretched. Rain converted the alluvial flats\r\n     into a wilderness of mud. The men were drenched and caked\r\n     with the riverine clay, the very rifles were often choked.\r\n\r\n     Meanwhile the advance guard carried out a reconnoissance up\r\n     the river and located the enemy in position at Sahilo, about\r\n     nine miles distant. They numbered about 5,000 men, with\r\n     twelve guns, under General Subr Bey, the Vali (Governor) of\r\n     Basra. The reconnoissance carried an advanced position with\r\n     a loss of sixty killed and wounded, and withdrew unmolested\r\n     to report.\r\n\r\n     On the 17th General Barrett paraded for the attack the bulk\r\n     of his force. After a trying march through a veritable\r\n     quagmire, the troops sometimes up to their waists in slush,\r\n     the division at about 9 A.M. came within range of the\r\n     Turkish position, and the leading brigade, the Belgaum,\r\n     (Major Gen. Fry,) deployed for attack.\r\n\r\n     The ground was absolutely open, and the Turks had a perfect\r\n     field of fire. On our side the men had the greatest\r\n     difficulty in getting forward through the clayey mud-beds\r\n     and the worn-out horses could not bring up the field\r\n     artillery. Nevertheless, the Belgaum brigade steadily\r\n     advanced, and the attack being presently supported by other\r\n     troops and assisted by the first of the two gunboats on the\r\n     river, at last closed upon the Turkish intrenchments and\r\n     carried them, capturing two guns and one hundred prisoners,\r\n     besides inflicting a very heavy loss in killed and wounded.\r\n\r\n     The retreat of the enemy was assisted by a mirage which\r\n     disconcerted our gunners. Subr Bey retreated on Basra, but\r\n     he had no hope of being able to hold the big spreading place\r\n     with his small force, and evacuated it. He retreated to\r\n     Kurna, where the Tigris joins the Euphrates. There he\r\n     intrenched himself. His main body was in Kurna, a large\r\n     village encircled by palm groves, in the marshy angle formed\r\n     by the two rivers, with a strong detachment in the\r\n     straggling village of Mazera, on the left bank of the\r\n     Tigris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The scene of the Persian Gulf Campaign.]\r\n\r\n     On Dec. 7 General Fry advanced upon the Kurna position. The\r\n     defenders of Mazera made a hard fight of it, assisted by the\r\n     strength of their position among a maze of pottery works\r\n     backed up by the ubiquitous palms, but in the afternoon the\r\n     village was carried.\r\n\r\n     Kurna was now isolated, but its capture presented great\r\n     difficulties. All through the 8th General Fry bombarded it\r\n     from Mazera, while his infantry were slowly ferried over\r\n     higher up. This was prepared by some daring sappers, who\r\n     swam the broad river and fixed a wire rope by which the\r\n     boats were worked backward and forward, and an advance was\r\n     made against Kurna from the rear.\r\n\r\n     Subr Bey had lost very heavily at Mazera, so he accepted the\r\n     inevitable and surrendered. So a brilliant little episode\r\n     came to a victorious conclusion. Subr Bey was returned his\r\n     sword and complimented on his stubborn defense.\r\n\r\n     The capture of Kurna secured the possession of the Basra\r\n     region. Since then operations have been directed to securing\r\n     it against Turkish attempts at recovery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: German Colonial Possessions in the Pacific]\r\n\r\nA recent stage of this campaign is thus described in The Pioneer Mail\r\n(Allahabad) June 4, 1915:\r\n\r\n     It is announced from Simla that on the morning of May 31 a\r\n     further advance up the Tigris River was made by the British\r\n     expeditionary force in close co-operation with the navy.\r\n     Notwithstanding the excessive heat the troops advanced with\r\n     great dash and determination, and successively captured four\r\n     positions held by the enemy. As far as reported we suffered\r\n     only a few casualties. Valuable work was performed by our\r\n     aeroplanes. The operations are proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe British force at the end of June had reached Shaiba.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE \"UNREST\" IN INDIA.\r\n\r\nThe splendid work done by Indian regulars and Indian imperial forces\r\n(the forces supplied by native Princes) in Europe, in Africa, in\r\nEgypt, in Mesopotamia is a sufficient answer to the suggestion that\r\nBritish influence in India has been weakened by the war. The\r\nenthusiastic formation of volunteer corps, both of Europeans and of\r\nnatives, is a further proof that the peoples of India, now more than\r\never, realize the benefits of liberty and security which they enjoy.\r\nIn India the torpedoing of the Lusitania made a profound impression,\r\nas the native press proves.\r\n\r\nA notable trial, the Lahore conspiracy case, disclosed the curious\r\nfact that almost the only case of \"unrest\" in India was \"made in\r\nAmerica\" by returned emigrants from Canada and California, who, on\r\ntheir way back, were interviewed by the German Consuls at Chinese\r\nports and advised to stir up an insurrection. This they tried to do,\r\nusing bombs made of brass inkpots, and bombarding the houses of\r\nwell-to-do natives, seeking in this way to raise money to finance the\r\nrising.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer Mail (Allahabad) gives an interesting account of the trial\r\nof these peculiar patriots, half of whom seem to have informed on the\r\nother half. It appears that they, or others like them, were\r\ninstrumental in causing the recent riot at Singapore, in which some\r\ntwenty European men and women were killed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. GERMAN ISLANDS IN THE PACIFIC.\r\n\r\nA curious result of the world war has been the expeditions initiated\r\nby the great oversea dominions of Britain and by India. The work of\r\ntwo of these, in Africa and Mesopotamia, has been already described.\r\nThere remain the joint Australian and New Zealand expeditions against\r\nthe island colonies of Germany and the great semi-continental area of\r\nNew Guinea.\r\n\r\nA lively account of the expedition against the Samoa Islands is\r\nprinted in The Sydney Bulletin for Sept. 24:\r\n\r\n     The recent expedition to Samoa furnished many surprises,\r\n     chief among which was the adaptability of the Maorilanders\r\n     to military discipline. When the men came on board the\r\n     transports (Moeraki and Monowai) discipline simply wasn't in\r\n     their dictionaries. They acknowledged orders with a \"Right\r\n     O, Sport,\" or with an argument. Companies were referred to\r\n     as mobs, the commanding officer as the boss or the\r\n     admiral....\r\n\r\n     The night before we reached Samoa an English military\r\n     officer on board told me it was remarkable, and highly\r\n     creditable, the rapidity with which the men had adapted\r\n     themselves to the changed circumstances....\r\n\r\n     The expedition called at Noumea to pick up the French\r\n     warship Montcalm, also the Australia and Melbourne of ours.\r\n     Noumea had been very worried since the war began, lest the\r\n     German fleet from Samoa would come along and bombard the\r\n     place. Had notices up to the effect that five shots would\r\n     signify the arrival of the Germans, and that every\r\n     inhabitant was then to grab rations and make for the\r\n     horizon. The welcome the French handed to us would have\r\n     stirred the blood of a jellyfish.\r\n\r\n     Samoa proved a walk-over. Not a gun, not a ship, not a mine.\r\n     A bunch of schoolboys with Shanghais and a hatful of rocks\r\n     could have taken it. The German fleet that was supposed to\r\n     be waiting to welcome us hadn't been around for eleven\r\n     months. Seemingly the German fleet has gone into the\r\n     business of not being around.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. GERMAN NEW GUINEA.\r\n\r\nThe Australasian (Melbourne) for Sept. 19 prints the following,\r\ndescribing the conquest of German New Guinea, which, with the Bismarck\r\nArchipelago, off the coast, has an area of 90,000 square\r\nmiles--something less than half the size of the German Empire:\r\n\r\n     The Minister for Defense (Mr. Millen) has received the\r\n     following further information by wireless regarding the\r\n     operations at Herbertshohe and Rabaul, from Admiral Patey:\r\n     The Australian naval reserve captured the wireless station\r\n     at Herbertshohe at 1 P.M. on Sept. 12, after eighteen hours'\r\n     bush fighting over about six miles. Herbertshohe and Rabaul,\r\n     the seat of Government, have been garrisoned and a base has\r\n     been established at Simpsonshafen.\r\n\r\n     Have prisoners: German officers, 2, including commandant;\r\n     German non-commissioned officers, 15; and native police, 56.\r\n     German casualties about 20 to 30 killed. Simpsonshafen swept\r\n     and ready to be entered Sept. 12.\r\n\r\n     Naval force landed under Commander Beresford of the\r\n     Australian Navy met with vigorous opposition. Advanced party\r\n     at dawn established landing before enemy aware of intention.\r\n     From within a few hundred yards of landing bush fight for\r\n     almost four miles. Roads and fronts also mined in places,\r\n     and stations intrenched. Officer commanding German forces in\r\n     trench 500 yards seaward side of station has surrendered\r\n     unconditionally.\r\n\r\n     Our force have reconnoitred enemy strength holding station.\r\n     Have landed 12-pounder guns, and if station does not\r\n     surrender intend shelling. Regret to report following\r\n     casualties: 4 killed, 3 wounded.\r\n\r\nLater a wireless message from Rear-Admiral Sir George Patey informed\r\nthe Minister for Defense (Mr. E.D. Millen) on Monday, Sept. 14, that,\r\nas a result of the operations of the Australian Expeditionary Force,\r\nRabaul, the seat of government in German New Guinea, had been\r\noccupied. The British flag was hoisted over the town at 3:30 on Sunday\r\nafternoon (Sept. 13, 1914) and it was saluted. A proclamation was then\r\nread by Rear-Admiral Patey, formerly setting out the occupation.\r\n\r\nApia (Samoa) had been occupied by British forces on Aug. 29. The\r\nCaroline Islands, first occupied by Japan, were turned over to New\r\nZealand. The Marshall and Solomon Islands were likewise occupied on\r\nDec. 9, thus completing the tale of Germany's colonial possessions in\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\nThere remain large areas in Kamerun and East Africa, but in both cases\r\nthe coast line is in the possession of the Entente powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. FIGHTING IN THE CAUCASUS.\r\n\r\nThe first considerable battle in the Caucasus, after Turkey entered\r\nthe war, was decided in favor of Russia, on Jan. 3. On Jan. 16 the\r\nEleventh Corps of the Turkish Army was cut up at Kara Urgaun. On Jan.\r\n30 the Russians occupied Tabriz. On Feb. 8 Trebizond was bombarded by\r\nRussian destroyers. On May 4 the Turks were again defeated, leaving\r\n3,500 dead.\r\n\r\nThe most recent considerable action was the taking of the ancient and\r\nimportant City of Van, which is graphically described in Novoe Vremya,\r\nJune 19:\r\n\r\n     \"When our armies scattered the forces of Halil Bey and\r\n     gained marked successes in the western part of Azerbijan,\r\n     the question of taking Van and the more important towns on\r\n     Lake Van arose. At the same time we received news of the\r\n     desperate situation of the Christians (Armenians) of the Van\r\n     vilayet, who had been compelled to take up arms against the\r\n     Kurds.\r\n\r\n     \"Our division was directed to go to Van through the Sanjak\r\n     of Bajazet, crossing the Tatar Pass under fire of Turkish\r\n     regulars and Kurds. In spite of the Spring season, the whole\r\n     pass was covered with a thick carpet of snow, in places up\r\n     to our men's belts. At the highest point of the pass, 10,000\r\n     feet, we were forced to halt. After a brief rest we reached\r\n     Taparitz and were immediately in contact with the enemy, who\r\n     attacked with shell and rifle fire, but we soon silenced\r\n     them with our rifles and machine guns. Scattering, the Turks\r\n     and Kurds hid among the rocks and sniped at us.\r\n\r\n     \"From Taparitz we advanced much more rapidly along the Abaga\r\n     Valley, then turned to the west along the River\r\n     Bendimach-Su, the best route to Van. We were informed that\r\n     Begri-Kala was strongly occupied by Turks who were\r\n     determined to defend it to the last.\r\n\r\n     \"They began an irregular fire, which soon developed into a\r\n     hotly contested battle. We were compelled to reply with\r\n     bullet and bayonet. We took several mountain guns, many\r\n     rifles and cartridges and much ammunition. Many of the\r\n     enemy threw up their hands and surrendered. We liberated\r\n     several dozen Christian girls who had been captured by the\r\n     Kurds at the time of the Turk and Kurd raid on the Armenian\r\n     villages.\r\n\r\n     \"We then resumed our march on Van, after driving the Turks\r\n     from the Village of Sor. The enemy gathered in the Town of\r\n     Janik, one march from Van, on the northeast shore of Lake\r\n     Van. To take Janik cost us several days' fighting. The Turks\r\n     fought desperately, undaunted by enormous losses, their dead\r\n     falling in heaps on all sides. The Turkish infantry fought a\r\n     brave and honorable fight, but the Kurds are foul fighters,\r\n     murdering and looting.\r\n\r\n     \"Attacking directly with only a part of our forces, we sent\r\n     the rest by a long detour around the enemy's position,\r\n     taking the Turks in flank; then our men charged with the\r\n     bayonet, and the fight was over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scene of operation of Russians against the Turks in the\r\nCaucasus.]\r\n\r\n     \"The fall of Janik decided the fate of Van. On the night of\r\n     May 5 (18) the Turks evacuated Van, leaving twenty-six guns,\r\n     3,000 poods (a pood equals 36 pounds) of powder, their\r\n     treasure and documents; they went so silently that the\r\n     inhabitants did not know of it until the next morning.\r\n\r\n     \"On May 6 (19) the birthday of Czar Nicholas II., we entered\r\n     antique Van, the centre of the large and once wealthy\r\n     vilayet of the same name, amid extraordinary rejoicings, the\r\n     entire Christian population coming forth to meet us,\r\n     strewing flowers and green branches in the streets and\r\n     decking our soldiers with garlands.\r\n\r\n     \"The capture of Van is as important politically as it is\r\n     strategically. The advance on Mush and Bitlis is a necessary\r\n     consequence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn \"Insult\" to War\r\n\r\n\r\nMount Kisco, N.Y., July 11, 1915.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of The New York Times:_\r\n\r\nOn Friday night at Carnegie Hall Miss Jane Addams stated that in the\r\npresent war, in order to get soldiers to charge with the bayonet, all\r\nnations are forced first to make them drunk. I quote from THE TIMES\r\nreport:\r\n\r\n     In Germany they have a regular formula for it [she said]. In\r\n     England they use rum and the French resort to absinthe. In\r\n     other words, therefore, in the terrible bayonet charges they\r\n     speak of with dread, the men must be doped before they\r\n     start.\r\n\r\nIn this war the French or English soldier who has been killed in a\r\nbayonet charge gave his life to protect his home and country. For his\r\nsupreme exit he had prepared himself by months of discipline. Through\r\nthe Winter in the trenches he has endured shells, disease, snow and\r\nice. For months he had been separated from his wife, children,\r\nfriends--all those he most loved. When the order to charge came it was\r\nfor them he gave his life, that against those who destroyed Belgium\r\nthey might preserve their home, might live to enjoy peace.\r\n\r\nMiss Addams denies him the credit of his sacrifice. She strips him of\r\nhonor and courage. She tells his children, \"Your father did not die\r\nfor France, or for England, or for you; he died because he was drunk.\"\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, since the war began, no statement had been so unworthy\r\nor so untrue and ridiculous. The contempt it shows for the memory of\r\nthe dead is appalling; the credulity and ignorance it displays are\r\ninconceivable.\r\n\r\nMiss Addams does not know that even from France they have banished\r\nabsinthe. If she doubts that in this France had succeeded let her ask\r\nfor it. I asked for it, and each maitre d'hotel treated me as though I\r\nhad proposed we should assassinate General Joffre.\r\n\r\nIf Miss Addams does know that the French Government has banished\r\nabsinthe, then she is accusing it of openly receiving the\r\ncongratulations of the world for destroying the drug while secretly\r\nusing it to make fiends of the army.

The official\r\n     German reports of the campaign concentrated upon the Polish\r\n     capital of Warsaw follow. On July 19 a Petrograd dispatch to\r\n     the London Morning Post reported that Emperor William had\r\n     telegraphed his sister, the Queen of Greece, to the effect\r\n     that he had \"paralyzed Russia for at least six months to\r\n     come\" and was on the eve of \"delivering a coup on the\r\n     western front that will make all Europe tremble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORMING OF RADYMNO\r\n\r\n_The semi-official report dispatched by the Wolff Telegraphic Bureau\r\nfrom Berlin on June 3, 1915, reads as follows:_\r\n\r\nFrom the Great Headquarters we learn the following concerning the\r\nbattles at Radymno:\r\n\r\nThe corps of General von Mackensen, on the evening of the 23d of May,\r\nstood on both sides of the San in a great bow directed toward the\r\neast. On the right wing Bavarian troops stood on the watch facing the\r\nnorthwest front of the fortress of Przemysl. In touch with the\r\nBavarian troops German and Austro-Hungarian forces stood south of the\r\nSan before the strongly fortified bridgehead of Radymno. Farther north\r\nstill other troops linked up with the army.\r\n\r\nThe bridgehead of Radymno consisted of a threefold line of field\r\nworks. There was in the first place the main position well provided\r\nwith wire entanglements. This ran along the heights that lie westward\r\nof the village of Ostroro and through the low lands of the San up to\r\nthis river. Then there was a well-constructed intermediate position\r\nwhich was laid through the long straggling village of Ostroro. Finally\r\nthere was the so-called bridgehead of Zagrody which was constructed\r\nfor the protection of the street and railroad bridges crossing the\r\nriver to the east of Radymno. Air-men had photographed all these\r\npositions and had reduced the views by the photogrammeter and\r\ntransferred them to the map.\r\n\r\nThe first task was to render the enemy's main positions ripe for\r\nattack. With this object the artillery on the afternoon of May 23\r\nbegan its fire, which was continued on the next day. From the heights\r\nnear Jaroslau could be seen the valley of the San lying in the mists,\r\nout of which jutted the cupola towers of Radymno and the hamlets of\r\nOstroro, Wietlin, Wysocko, etc. The artillery fire was raised to the\r\nutmost pitch of intensity. The heavy projectiles howling, furrowed the\r\nair, lit great fires as they struck and excavated vast pits in the\r\nearth. The Russian artillery replied.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock in the morning the long infantry lines rose in their\r\nstorming positions and advanced to the attack. The flyers reported\r\nthat behind the enemy's positions they observed grazing cattle and\r\nbaggage carts. The enemy seemed not to expect a serious attack.\r\nAnyhow, the Petersburg bulletin had announced that the battles in\r\nGalicia had decreased in intensity, that the Teutonic allies had\r\npractically throughout gone over to the defensive.\r\n\r\nAt six-thirty in the morning the enemy's main position in its whole\r\nextent was in the hands of the German troops. Shaken by the heavy\r\nartillery fire the enemy had made only brief resistance; he was in\r\nhasty retreat toward the east.\r\n\r\nBut just in that direction and into Radymno, whence the enemy's\r\nreinforcements were to be expected, the artillery had in the meantime\r\nturned its fire. Great clouds of smoke covered these villages set\r\nafire by the bombardment. The Russians thus did not have the chance to\r\ntake permanent footing in Ostroro. The troops holding the town\r\nsurrendered, leaving hundreds of guns and great quantities of\r\nammunition in the hands of the victors.\r\n\r\nAlong the whole line the German infantry was now advancing upon\r\nRadymno and the villages connecting with this place, Skolowszo and\r\nZamojsce. With every step forward the number of prisoners was\r\nincreased. Soon one division reported to headquarters that it did not\r\nhave enough men to attend to the removal of the great masses of\r\nprisoners without prejudice to the conduct of the action. Cavalry was\r\ntherefore assigned to this task.\r\n\r\nAt Radymno the enemy's troops had become jammed in crowds. A wooden\r\nwagon bridge over the San had been burned down too soon. From the\r\nposition of the staff directing the battle one could see the leaping\r\nflames and the clouds of heavy black smoke caused by the pouring on of\r\nnaphtha. One could also see long columns fleeing eastward covering the\r\nstreet toward Dunkowice with their disordered crowds. As the Russian\r\nrecruits which had been gathered in Radymno made only a brief\r\nresistance, this place together with all the artillery which was\r\nattempting to escape through the town to the San, was also lost. Only\r\nat the bridgehead of Zagrody did the Russian leaders, by hastily\r\nbringing up fresh reserves, finally check the attack of the Germans.\r\nOn this day 70 officers, 9,000 men, 42 machine guns, 52 cannon of\r\nwhich 10 were heavy, 14 ammunition wagons, and extensive other booty\r\nwas reported. But also on the north bank of the San a great battle had\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRZEMYSL\r\n\r\n_A semi-official dispatch by the Wolff Telegraphic Bureau dated\r\nBerlin, June 6, said:_\r\n\r\nFrom the Great Headquarters we have received the following telegram\r\nconcerning the fall of the fortress Przemysl:\r\n\r\nWhen on the 2d of May the offensive of the allies in West Galicia\r\nbegan, few probably could have imagined that four weeks later the\r\nheavy guns of the Central Powers would open their fire on Przemysl.\r\nThe Russian staff was not likely to have been prepared for this\r\npossibility. Its decision swayed this way and that, whether, as\r\noriginally planned, to hold the fortress, for \"political reasons\" or\r\n\"voluntarily to withdraw\" from it. Constantly our airmen reported the\r\nmarching of troops in and out of the fortress. On the 21st of May the\r\ndecision seemed to have been reached to abandon it. In spite of this,\r\neight days later the place was stubbornly defended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eight German military positions about Przemysl and\r\nLemberg.]\r\n\r\nGeneral von Kneussl pushed the line of his Bavarian regiments from the\r\nnorth closer to the fortress to shut in the foe. About eleven o'clock\r\nin the forenoon the heavy batteries began to engage the forts on the\r\nnorth front. In the night from the 30th to the 31st of May the\r\ninfantry pushed forward closer to the wire entanglements. It awaited\r\nthe effect of the heavy artillery. This confined the defenders to\r\ntheir bomb-proof shelters, so that our infantry could step out of its\r\ntrenches and from the top of the breastworks watch the tremendous\r\ndrama of destruction. The lighter guns of the assailants found ideal\r\npositions in the battery emplacements formerly built by the Russians\r\nas part of their siege works when operating against the Austrians in\r\nPrzemysl. So, too, General von Kneussl with his staff found shelter\r\nnear, and the chief of artillery in the observation station\r\nconstructed by the Russians near Batycze. From this point, distant\r\nfrom the line of forts only a little more than two kilometers, one\r\ncould observe the whole front of Forts 10 and 11. On the 31st of May,\r\nat four in the afternoon, the heavy guns ceased firing. Simultaneously\r\nthe infantry, Bavarian regiments, a Prussian regiment and a detachment\r\nof Austrian sharp-shooters, moved to the attack. The destruction of\r\nthe works and advanced points of support of the fortress by the heavy\r\nartillery had such a shattering and depressing effect on its garrison\r\nthat it was not capable of offering any effective resistance to the\r\nattacking infantry.\r\n\r\nThe troops manning Forts 10a, 11a, and 11, such of them as did not lie\r\nburied in the shattered casemates, fled, leaving behind their entire\r\nwar material, including a great number of the newest light and heavy\r\nRussian guns. The enemy replied to the assailants who pushed forward\r\nto the circular connecting road, only with artillery fire, and in the\r\nnight made no counter attack of any kind. On the 1st of June the enemy\r\nthrew several single battalions into a counter attack. These attacks\r\nwere repulsed without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe heavy artillery now fought down Forts 10 and 11. The Prussian\r\ninfantry regiment No. 45, jointly with Bavarian troops, stormed two\r\nearthworks lying to the east of Fort 11 which the enemy had\r\nstubbornly defended. On the 2d of June, at noon, the 22d regiment of\r\nBavarian infantry stormed Fort 10, in which all \"bombproofs\" except\r\none had been made heaps of debris by the action of the heavy\r\nartillery. A battalion of fusiliers of the Queen Augusta Guard\r\nregiment of grenadiers in the evening took Fort 12. Works 10b, 9a and\r\n9b capitulated.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the troops of General von Kneussl began the attack in\r\nthe direction of the city. The village Zurawica and the fortified\r\npositions of the enemy situated there were captured. The enemy now\r\ndesisted from all further resistance. Thus the German troops, followed\r\nlater by the 4th Austro-Hungarian cavalry division were able to occupy\r\nthe strongly built inner line of forts, and at 3 o'clock in the\r\nmorning after making numerous prisoners, to march into the relieved\r\ncity of Przemysl.\r\n\r\nHere, where a battalion of the third infantry regiment of the Guard\r\nwas the first troop to enter, there was still a last halt before the\r\nburned bridges over the San. But these were soon replaced with\r\nmilitary bridges. After a siege of only four days the fortress of\r\nPrzemysl was again in the hands of the allies. The Russians had in\r\nvain attacked this fortress for months. Although they brought\r\nhecatombs of bloody sacrifices they had not succeeded in taking the\r\nfortress by storm. Only by starvation did they bring it to fall, and\r\nthey were enabled to enjoy their possession only nine weeks. Energetic\r\nand daring leadership, supported by heroically fighting troops and\r\nexcellent heavy artillery, had in the briefest possible space of time\r\nreduced the great fortress.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF GRODEK\r\n\r\n_A semi-official dispatch by the Wolff Telegraphic Bureau, dated\r\nBerlin, June 27, reported as follows:_\r\n\r\nFrom the Great Headquarters we have received the following telegram\r\nabout the battle for Grodek and the Wereszyca position:\r\n\r\nIn the night from the 15th to the 16th of June the enemy began his\r\nretreat in front of the allied troops in an easterly and northeasterly\r\ndirection. He was now unquestionably withdrawing to his defenses on\r\nthe Wereszyca and the so-called Grodek position. The Wereszyca is a\r\nlittle stream that rises in the hilly lands of Magierow and flows in a\r\nsoutherly course to the Dniester. Insignificant as the streamlet is in\r\nitself, it yet forms, because of the width of its valley and the ten\r\nrather large lakes in it, a locality peculiarly well fitted for\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nWhatever was lacking to the situation in natural strength had been\r\nsupplied by art. This the Russians displayed above all in the Grodek\r\nposition which, joining the Wereszyca on the north at Janow, stretches\r\nfor a distance of more than 70 kilometres in a northwestern direction\r\nas far as the region of Narol Miasto. Thousands of laborers had here\r\nworked for months to construct a fortified position which does honor\r\nto the Russian engineers. Here extensive clearings have been made in\r\nthe forests. Dozens of works for infantry defense, hundreds of\r\nkilometres of rifle trenches, covering and connecting trenches, had\r\nbeen dug, the hilly forest land quite transformed, and finally vast\r\nwire entanglements stretched along the entire Wereszyca and Grodek\r\nfront. Taken as a whole this position formed the last great bulwark\r\nwith which the Russians hoped to check their victorious opponents and\r\nto bring their advance upon Lemberg to a permanent halt.\r\n\r\nThe Russian army found itself incapable of acting up to these\r\nexpectations of its leaders. A cavalry regiment of the Guard, with the\r\ncannon and machine guns assigned to it, succeeded on the 16th of June,\r\non the road Jaworow-Niemirow, in making a surprise attack on a Russian\r\ninfantry brigade marching northward to the Grodek position and in\r\nscattering it in the forests. In the evening the city of Niemirow was\r\nstormed. On the 18th of June the armies of General von Mackensen\r\ndeployed into line of battle before the Russian positions. On the\r\nfollowing day they moved to the attack. Early in the morning the\r\ndecisive onslaught was made on the Grodek position and in the evening\r\non the Wereszyca line. Very soon the hostile positions on both sides\r\nof the Sosnina forest were taken. Four of the enemy's guns were\r\ncaptured, and the Russian positions on Mt. Horoszyko, which had been\r\nbuilt up into a veritable fortress, were stormed.\r\n\r\nThe main attack was made by regiments of the Prussian Guard. Before\r\nthem lay, to the west of Magierow, Hill 350. Even from a distance it\r\ncan be seen that this elevation, rising to a height of fifty metres\r\nabove the slope, is the key to the whole position. The defenses\r\nconsisted of two rows of trenches, lying one over the other, with\r\nstrong cover, and with wire entanglements and abattis in front of\r\nthem. At daybreak began the artillery battle. This already at six\r\no'clock in the morning resulted in the complete subduing of the\r\nRussian artillery, which, as always in the recently preceding days,\r\nheld back and only very cautiously and with sparing use of ammunition\r\ntook part in the battle. At seven the hostile position was considered\r\nripe for storming and the infantry attack ordered. Although the forces\r\nmanning the heights still took up the fire against the attackers, it\r\nwas without, however, inflicting on them losses worth mentioning. The\r\nGerman heavy artillery had done its duty. The enemy was so demoralized\r\nthat, although in the beginning he kept up his fire, he preferred to\r\nabsent himself before the entry of the Germans into his trenches.\r\n\r\nMore than 700 prisoners and about a dozen machine guns fell into the\r\nhands of the attackers. In the ditches that were taken alone there lay\r\n200 dead Russians. In the meantime the attack was directed against the\r\nneighboring sections. Soon the Russians found themselves compelled\r\nalso to vacate without giving battle the very strong position running\r\nnorth of the street that leads to Magierow, with its front toward the\r\nsouth. Since the German troops were able to penetrate with the fleeing\r\nenemy into Magierow and to advance north of the city toward the east,\r\nthe position at Bialo-Piaskowa also became untenable. The Russians\r\nflowed backward and only at Lawryko again tried to get a firm\r\nfooting. Late in the evening a Guard regiment took the railroad\r\nstation of Dabrocin, where but a short time before the Russians had\r\nbeen trans-shipping troops, and thus won the Lemberg-Rawa-Ruska road.\r\nThe adjoining corps in the evening stood about on a level with the\r\nregiments of the Guard. Again penetration of the Russian front had\r\nsucceeded to a width of 25 kilometres, and the fate of Lemberg had\r\nbeen decided here and on the Wereszyca. This line was stormed late in\r\nthe evening and partly in the early morning hours of the 20th of June.\r\nThe German corps, which on this day had been joined by the German\r\nEmperor, stormed the hostile positions of Stawki as far as the Bulawa\r\noutwork. Since the morning hours of the 20th of June the enemy, who in\r\nplaces had already withdrawn in the night, was in full retreat toward\r\nthe east along the whole front. The pursuit was at once undertaken. On\r\nthe evening of the same day Royal and Imperial troops stood close\r\nbefore the fortifications of Lemberg.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF LEMBERG\r\n\r\n_A semi-official report dispatch by the Wolff Telegraphic Bureau from\r\nBerlin, June 28, reads:_\r\n\r\nFrom the Great Headquarters we have received the following telegram\r\nabout the taking of Lemberg:\r\n\r\nThe Russians entered Lemberg, the capital of Galicia, a city of\r\n250,000 inhabitants, in the beginning of September, 1914. They at once\r\nrestored to the city its Polish name, Lwow, and during their reign in\r\nthe beautiful town made themselves exceedingly well at home. They\r\nbegan promptly to develop Lemberg into a great fortress and for the\r\nfurther protection of their new possession to construct the fortified\r\nlines of Grodek and Wereszyca. The protective works of Lemberg built\r\nby the Austrians were strengthened and extended by the Russians,\r\nespecially along the south and southwest fronts. The existing depot\r\nfacilities were enlarged and a number of railways, both field and\r\npermanent, extended throughout the domain of the fortress. To\r\nguarantee the maintenance of the fortress of Lemberg, even in case the\r\nGrodek position should be penetrated and have to be given up, a\r\nstrongly fortified supporting work had been built. This ran along the\r\nheights to the west of the Lemberg-Rawa-Ruska railway to the vicinity\r\nof Dobrocin.\r\n\r\nAfter the armies of General von Mackensen had broken through the\r\nGrodek and Wereszyca position, German divisions and allied troops\r\nstruck these supporting works. The centre of the Army Boehm-Ermolli\r\nsimultaneously approached the west from Lemberg. The main body of this\r\narmy attacked sections of the hostile army which had prepared for\r\nrenewed resistance behind the Szczerzek and Stavczonka streams and in\r\ncontact with the fortress on the south. This position on the evening\r\nof the 21st of June was successfully penetrated at several points and\r\nthe attacking troops were pushed closer to the defenses on the west\r\nfront of Lemberg. German connecting troops under the leadership of\r\nGeneral von der Marwitz on the same day stormed the most important\r\npoints of the stubbornly defended supporting position. They thus\r\ncompelled the enemy to evacuate this position in the whole of its\r\nextent and opened for the adjacent Austrian troops the road to the\r\ndefenses on the northwest front of the fortress. In consequence the\r\nAustro-Hungarian troops were able on the 22d of June to take the works\r\non the northwest and west fronts.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock in the morning fell the fortification Rzesna, soon\r\nthereafter Sknilow, and toward eleven Lysa Gora. This work was\r\nconquered by infantry regiment No. 34, \"William I., German Emperor and\r\nKing of Prussia.\" In the Rzesna fortification alone, besides gun\r\nlimbers and machine guns, 400 prisoners were taken who belonged to no\r\nless than eighteen different Russian divisions. In the work there was\r\nfound, besides masses of weapons and ammunition, a large number of\r\nunopened wooden boxes containing steel blinders (Stahlblenden).\r\n\r\nAt noon of that day the victorious troops set foot in the Galician\r\ncapital in which the Russians had ruled for nearly ten months. About\r\nfour o'clock in the afternoon the Austrian commander made his entry\r\ninto the city, which was quite undamaged and decked with flags. In the\r\nstreets, in the windows and on balconies stood thousands and thousands\r\nof the inhabitants, who enthusiastically greeted their deliverers and\r\nshowered the automobiles with a rain of flowers. The next day the\r\ncommander-in-chief, General von Mackensen, congratulated in Lemberg\r\nthe conqueror of the fortress, the Austrian General of Cavalry von\r\nBoehm-Ermolli. The German Emperor, on receiving the announcement of\r\nthe fall of Lemberg, sent the following telegram to General von\r\nMackensen:\r\n\r\n\"Accept on the crowning event of your brilliantly led Galician\r\ncampaign, the fall of Lemberg, my warmest congratulations. It\r\ncompletes an operation which, systematically prepared and executed\r\nwith energy and skill, has led in only six weeks to successes in\r\nbattles and amount of booty, and that, too, in the open field, seldom\r\nrecorded in the history of wars. To God's gracious support we, in the\r\nfirst instance, owe this shining victory, and then to your\r\nbattle-tried leadership and the bravery of the allied troops under\r\nyou, both fighting in true comradeship. As an expression of my\r\nthankful recognition I appoint you field marshal.\r\n\r\n(Signed) \"Wilhelm I.R.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time the commander of the Austrian army, Grand Duke\r\nFrederick, was appointed a Prussian general field marshal. The\r\nfaithful working together of the allied armies had borne rich fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CZAR'S RESCRIPT\r\n\r\n_The following Imperial Rescript addressed to the Premier, M.\r\nGoremykin, was announced at Petrograd on June 30:_\r\n\r\nFrom all parts of the country I have received appeals testifying to\r\nthe firm determination of the Russian peoples to devote their strength\r\nto the work of equipping the Army. I derive from this national\r\nunanimity the unshakable assurance of a brilliant future. A prolonged\r\nwar calls for ever-fresh efforts. But, surmounting growing\r\ndifficulties and parrying the vicissitudes which are inevitable in\r\nwar, let us strengthen in our hearts the resolution to carry on the\r\nstruggle, with the help of God, to the complete triumph of the Russian\r\narms. The enemy must be crushed, for without that peace is impossible.\r\n\r\nWith firm faith in the inexhaustible strength of Russia, I anticipate\r\nthat the governmental and public institutions of Russian industry and\r\nall faithful sons of the Fatherland, without distinction of ideas and\r\nclasses, will work together in harmony to satisfy the needs of our\r\nvaliant Army. This is the only and, henceforth, the national problem\r\nto which must be directed all the thoughts of united Russia,\r\ninvincible in her unity.\r\n\r\nHaving formed, for the discussion of questions of supplying the Army,\r\na special commission, in which members of the Legislative Chambers and\r\nrepresentatives of industry participate, I recognize the necessity, in\r\nconsequence, of advancing the date of the reopening of these\r\nLegislative bodies in order to hear the voice of the country.\r\n\r\nHaving decided that the sessions of the Duma and the Council of the\r\nEmpire shall be resumed in the month of August at the latest, I rely\r\non the Council of Ministers to draw up, according to my indications,\r\nthe Bills necessitated by a time of war.--_Reuter._\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA'S DEFENSIVE PLAN\r\n\r\n_A dispatch to the London Daily Chronicle from Petrograd on July 6\r\nsaid:_\r\n\r\nThe Russian defense is now a two-fold and rather complex process.\r\nAlong the frontiers the army is parrying blows of the enemy and\r\nwearing him down, avoiding big battles, losing territory indeed,\r\nlittle by little, but gaining time and husbanding resources.\r\n\r\nThe other side of the process is the rally of the nation to the\r\nsupport of the army. It would be wholly wrong to regard the gradual\r\nadvance of the Germans and Austrians in Russian territory as evidence\r\nthat Russian resistance is breaking down. On the contrary the nation\r\nhas never been so thoroughly aroused as now.\r\n\r\nThe broad back of the Russian soldier has done marvels in sustaining\r\nthe heavy burden of war, but when retreat in Galicia began it suddenly\r\nflashed on the nation that this was not enough--valor must be\r\nreinforced by technique. The attitude of the nation to the war\r\nimmediately changed. Formerly it was a spectator watching with eager\r\nhope mingled with anxiety the deeds of the army that was part of its\r\nvery self. Now it has become an active reserve of the army and in\r\nsecuring liberty to act it has gained in moral force.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet is being strengthened, more effective contact is being\r\nestablished between the Government and the nation, and the War Office\r\nis now the centre of popular interest.\r\n\r\nRussia has not yet followed the example of her allies in appointing a\r\nMinister of Munitions, but the course of events is tending in this\r\ndirection and the new War Minister, General Polivanoff, commands the\r\nconfidence of the Duma and nation generally. The War Office has become\r\nthe focus of the new national organizing movement of which all\r\nexisting public bodies are being made the nucleus.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGHTING ON TWO RIVERS\r\n\r\n_The statement issued by the German Army Headquarters Staff in Berlin\r\non June 30 reported:_\r\n\r\nBetween the Bug and the Vistula Rivers the German and Austro-Hungarian\r\ntroops have reached the districts of Belz, Komanow and Zamosc and the\r\nnorthern border of the forest-plantations in the Tanew section. Also\r\non a line formed by the banks of the Vistula and in the district of\r\nZawichost, to the east of Zarow, the enemy has commenced a retreat.\r\n\r\nAn enemy aeroplane was forced to descend behind our lines. The\r\noccupants of the machine were made prisoners.\r\n\r\n_On July 1 the situation on the Russian front was thus officially\r\nreported from Berlin:_\r\n\r\nEastern theatre of war: Our positions here are unchanged. The booty\r\ntaken during June amounts to two flags and 25,695 prisoners, of whom\r\n120 were officers; seven cannon, six mine throwers, fifty-two machine\r\nguns, and one aeroplane, besides much material of war.\r\n\r\nSoutheastern theatre of war: After bitter fighting the troops under\r\nGeneral von Linsingen yesterday stormed the Russian positions east of\r\nthe Gnila Lipa River near Kunioze and Luozynoe and to the north of\r\nRohatyn. Three officers and 2,328 men were made prisoners and five\r\nmachine guns were captured.\r\n\r\nEast of Lemberg the Austro-Hungarian troops have pressed forward into\r\nthe enemy positions. The army under Field Marshal von Mackensen is\r\ncontinuing to press forward between the Bug and Vistula Rivers. West\r\nof the Vistula, after stubborn fighting by the Russians, the Teutonic\r\nallies are advancing on both sides of the Kamenna in pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of captures during June made by the Teutonic allied\r\ntroops under General von Linsingen, Field Marshal von Mackensen, and\r\nGeneral von Woyrich amounts to 409 officers and 140,650 men and 80\r\ncannon and 268 machine guns.\r\n\r\n_From Vienna--The following official communication was issued on July\r\n1 by the War Office:_\r\n\r\nBattles in Eastern Galicia continued on July 1 on the Gnila Lipa and\r\nin the region east of Lemberg. Our troops advanced in several places\r\non the heights east of the Gnila Lipa and broke through hostile\r\npositions. The allied troops also succeeded, after stubborn fighting,\r\nin reaching the eastern bank of the Rohatyn.\r\n\r\nOn the Dniester complete calm prevails. In the region of the source of\r\nthe Wieprz we occupied Zamoso, north of the Tanew all lower lands are\r\noccupied. West of the Vistula our troops pursued the flying enemy up\r\nto Tarlow.\r\n\r\nThe total booty taken during June by the allied troops during the\r\nfighting in the northeast comprises 521 officers and 194,000 men, 93\r\nguns, 164 machine guns, 78 caisson, and 100 military railroad\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\n\r\nKRASNIK REACHED\r\n\r\n_The statement issued by German Army Headquarters on July 2 says:_\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern Theatre: Southwest of Kalwarya, after stubborn fighting\r\nwe took a mine position from the enemy and made 600 Russians\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\nIn the Southeastern Theatre: After storming the heights southeast of\r\nBu-Kaszowice, north of Halicz, the Russians along the whole front from\r\nthe district of Maryampol to just north of Firjilow have been obliged\r\nto retreat. Troops under General von Linsingen are pursuing the\r\ndefeated enemy.\r\n\r\nUp to yesterday we had taken 7,765 prisoners, of whom 11 are officers.\r\nWe also captured eighteen machine guns.\r\n\r\n_The German official report of July 3 reads:_\r\n\r\nIn the Southeastern Theatre: North of the Dniester River our troops\r\nare advancing under continuous fighting in pursuit of the enemy and\r\npenetrating by way of the line of Mariampol, Narajoa and Miasto toward\r\nthe Zlota Lipa section. They have reached the Bug at several places\r\nbetween Kamionka and Strzumilowa and below Krylow and are quickly\r\nadvancing in a northerly direction between the Bug and the Vistula.\r\n\r\nThe lowlands of the Labunka now are in our possession, after our\r\nopponents had offered stubborn resistance at certain places.\r\n\r\nGerman troops also obtained a firm foothold on the northern bank of\r\nthe river in the Wysnica section, between Krasnik and the mouth of the\r\nLabunka.\r\n\r\nBetween the left bank of the Vistula and the Pilica River the\r\nsituation remains generally unchanged.\r\n\r\nA Russian counter-attack southeast of Radom was repulsed.\r\n\r\n_The following Austrian official war statement was given out in Vienna\r\non July 3:_\r\n\r\nIn East Galicia the Teutonic allied troops are advancing, pursuing the\r\nenemy east of Halicz and across the Narajowska, and to the north\r\nattacking successfully on the heights east of Janozyn. On the Bug\r\nRiver the situation is unchanged.\r\n\r\nBetween the Vistula and the Bug Rivers the Teutonic allied troops are\r\nsteadily advancing, with fierce fighting. Zamosc has been stormed.\r\nWest of there the Russians everywhere have been repulsed beyond the\r\nPor Plain, which is in our possession. At several places we forced a\r\npassage of the brook.\r\n\r\nEast of Krasnik, for which fighting is still proceeding, Studzianki\r\nhas been captured. The village of Wysnica, west of Krasnik, also was\r\nstormed. Here and elsewhere in this sector the enemy was repulsed.\r\n\r\nFriday on the Por and near Krasnik, 4,800 prisoners were captured, and\r\nthree machine guns were taken.\r\n\r\nWest of the Vistula there were artillery duels.\r\n\r\n_Following is the official report of the operations on the front in\r\nGalicia and Southern Poland, wirelessed July 4 from Berlin to\r\nSayville, N.Y.:_\r\n\r\nGeneral von Linsingen's army, in full pursuit of the enemy, is\r\nadvancing toward the Zlota Lipa. Three thousand Russians were taken\r\nprisoners yesterday. Under pressure of the Germans the enemy is\r\nevacuating his positions from Narajow to Miasto, and to the north of\r\nPrzemyslany from Kamionka to Krylow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.R.H.

JACKSON\r\n\r\nWho Succeeded Lord Fisher as First Sea Lord of the British Admiralty\r\n\r\n(_Photo by Elliott & Fry._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nON ZLOTA LIPA RIVER\r\n\r\n_Following is the Austrian official war statement given out from\r\nVienna on July 6:_\r\n\r\nIn Eastern Galicia the Teutonic allied troops under General von\r\nLinsingen, after two weeks of successful battles, have reached the\r\nZlota Lipa River, the western bank of which has been cleared of the\r\nenemy. In the sectors of Kamionka Strumilowa and Krasno battles\r\nagainst the Russian rearguards are continuing.\r\n\r\nNear Krylow (on the Bug River), in Southern Russian Poland, near the\r\nGalician border, the enemy has evacuated the western bank of the Bug\r\nand burned the village of Krylow.\r\n\r\nFighting is proceeding on both banks of the Upper Wieprz.\r\n\r\nThe Teutonic allied troops drove the enemy from positions north of the\r\nsmall River Por and advanced to Faras and Plonka.\r\n\r\nThe western army, commanded by Archduke Joseph Ferdinand, after\r\nseveral days' battle, broke through the Russian front on both sides of\r\nKrasnik and drove the Russians back with heavy losses in a northerly\r\ndirection. We captured twenty-nine officers and 8,000 men and took six\r\ncaissons and six machine guns.\r\n\r\nWest of the Vistula River the situation is unchanged.\r\n\r\n_The Petrograd correspondent of The London Times telegraphed on July\r\n6:_\r\n\r\nNo apprehension is entertained as to the fate of Warsaw, for the city\r\nbids fair to be protected. Even if the Germans should reach Ivangorod,\r\nthis would not necessarily involve the surrender of Warsaw.\r\n\r\nThe Russian waiting game in fact has been justified. The critic of the\r\nNovoe Vremya correctly explains the withdrawal as a manoeuvre\r\ndeliberately undertaken with the object of accepting battle under the\r\nbest conditions for the Russians. He adds that on the Vistula front\r\nthe ground which offers the Russians the greatest advantage is that\r\nwith Brest Litovsk as a base, Ivangorod on the right flank and a\r\nstrong army occupying the flank and rear positions in relation to the\r\nright flank of General von Boehm-Ermolli's Army.\r\n\r\n_The War Department at Vienna on July 6 gave out the following\r\nofficial statement:_\r\n\r\nThe Russians, who, in the second battle of Krasnik, were defeated by\r\nthe army of Archduke Joseph Ferdinand, are retreating in a northern\r\nand north-eastern direction, pursued by the Austrians who are pressing\r\nto attack.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians on Monday captured the district of Cieszanow and the\r\nheights north of Wysnica. Under pressure of our advance the enemy is\r\nretreating on the Wieprz beyond Tarnogora. Our booty in this fighting\r\nhas increased to 41 officers and 11,500 men and 17 machine guns.\r\n\r\nOn the Bug River and in East Galicia the situation is unchanged.\r\n\r\nOn the Zlota Lipa and Dniester Rivers quiet prevails.\r\n\r\n_German Army Headquarters wirelessed the following report from Berlin\r\nto Sayville, N.Y., on July 7:_\r\n\r\nDuring pursuit of the Russians to the Zlota Lipa River from July 3 to\r\nJuly 5 the Germans captured 3,850 men. The number of prisoners made\r\nsouth of Biale River has been increased to seven officers and about\r\n800 men.\r\n\r\nIn Poland, south of the Vistula, the Germans stormed Height 95, to the\r\neast of Dolowatka and south of Borzymow. The Russian losses were very\r\nconsiderable. Ten machine guns, one revolver gun and a quantity of\r\nrifles were taken.\r\n\r\nMore to the northward, near the Vistula, a Russian charge was\r\nrepulsed.\r\n\r\nThe Czernowitz, Bukowina, correspondent of the Zeitung am Mittag,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The scarcity of rifles with the Russians is growing greater daily.\r\nThe reserves are unarmed until they begin the attack, and then they\r\ntake rifles from their fallen comrades. The Russian artillery fire,\r\nhowever, has grown more active.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFEAT AT KRASNIK\r\n\r\n_From Austrian Army Headquarters in Galicia, July 11, came the\r\nfollowing:_\r\n\r\nThe relative subsidence of activity on the part of the Teutonic allies\r\nduring the last week may be explained by the fact that the goal set\r\nfor the Lemberg campaign already has been attained. This was the\r\nrecapture of the city and the securing of strong defensive positions\r\nto the eastward and northward. These positions have now been secured\r\nalong the line of the Zlota Lipa and Bug Rivers and the ridge to the\r\nnorthward of Krasnik.\r\n\r\nThe Russians attempted a counter-offensive from Lubin against the\r\nAustro-German positions north of Krasnik, bringing up heavy\r\nreinforcements for this purpose. Owing to this movement the Austrian\r\ntroops, which had rushed beyond the positions originally selected,\r\nwithdrew to the ridge, where they have been successfully resisting all\r\nRussian attacks. They feel secure in their present positions, and it\r\nis believed here that they can be easily held against whatever forces\r\nRussia can throw against them.\r\n\r\nIndications now point to a period of quiet along the Russo-Galician\r\nfront, while the Teutonic allies are preparing for operations in other\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n_This statement from Russian General Headquarters was published in\r\nPetrograd on July 14:_\r\n\r\nIn the direction of Lomza (Russian Poland) on the evening of July 12\r\nand also on the 13th, the enemy developed an intensive artillery fire.\r\nOn the right bank of the Pissa, on July 13, the Germans succeeded in\r\ncapturing Russian trenches on a front of two versts (about one and\r\none-third miles). They, however, were driven back by a counter-attack\r\nand the trenches were recaptured.\r\n\r\nOn both banks of the Shikva stubborn fighting has taken place.\r\nConsiderable enemy forces between the Orjetz (Orzyc?) and the Lydymia\r\nadopted the offensive and the Russians, declining a decisive\r\nengagement, retreated during the night of the 13th to their second\r\nline of positions. On the left bank of the Vistula the situation is\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nIn the battle near Wilkolaz, south of Lublin, during the week ending\r\nJuly 11 the Russians captured 97 officers and 22,464 men.\r\n\r\nIn the Cholm region engagements have taken place along the Volitza\r\nRiver, and on the night of July 13 we captured over 150 prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn the rest of the front there have been the usual artillery\r\nengagements. On the evening of July 12 the enemy assumed the offensive\r\non the Narew front.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRZASNYSZ OCCUPIED\r\n\r\nIn the eastern theater: In the course of minor fights on the Windau\r\nbelow Koltany 425 Russians were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Niemen River, in the neighborhood of Kalwarya, our troops\r\ncaptured several outer positions at Franziskowa and Osowa and\r\nmaintained them against fierce counter-attacks.\r\n\r\nTo the northeast of Suwalki the Heights of Olszauka were taken by\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nSouth of Kolno we captured the village of Konsya, and the enemy\r\npositions east of this village and south of the Tartak line. Two\r\nthousand four hundred prisoners and eight machine guns fell into our\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nBattles in the neighborhood of Przasnysz are being continued. Several\r\nenemy lines were captured by our troops, and the City of Przasnysz,\r\nfor which we were fighting hotly in the last days of February, and\r\nwhich was strongly fortified by the Russians, we have occupied by our\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nIn the southeastern theater the situation generally is the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN \"NUT-CRACKER\"\r\n\r\n_A Petrograd dispatch to the London Morning Post said on July 15:_\r\n\r\nThe Germans have opened a new campaign for the conquest of Russia.\r\nTheir plan is to catch the Russian armies like a nut between\r\nnutcrackers.\r\n\r\nThe German line of advance from the northwest lies between the\r\nMlawa-Warsaw Railway line and the River Pissa and from the south from\r\nthe Galician line. On paper the German scheme is that these two fronts\r\nshall move to meet one another and everything between them must be\r\nground to powder. But the nut to be cracked is rather a formidable\r\narea of space and well fortified, the kernel sound and healthy, being\r\nformed of the Russian armies inspired not merely with the\r\nrighteousness of their cause, but the fullest confidence in themselves\r\nand absolute devotion to the proved genius of their Commander in\r\nChief. The area referred to cannot be less than eighty miles in\r\nextent, north to south, by 120 miles west to east. That is the mere\r\nnucleus and minimum area, as contained between the Novo Georgievsk\r\nfortress in the north to the Ivangorod fortress in the south and the\r\nRussian lines on the Bzura in the west to Brest-Litovsk on the east.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The German battle line on July 24, in Russian Poland.]\r\n\r\nThe Germans have an incalculable amount of fighting to face before\r\nthey win to that area, the nut to be cracked, and then the cracking is\r\nstill to be done. It is all sheer frontal fighting. The Germans have\r\nbeen twelve months trying frontal attacks against Warsaw on a\r\ncomparatively narrow front, and in vain. What chance have they of\r\nsuccess by dividing their forces against the united strength of\r\nRussia?\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAKING RUSSIA'S LINES\r\n\r\n_An official German bulletin dated Berlin, July 17, reported:_\r\n\r\nThe offensive movement begun a few days ago in the eastern theatre of\r\nwar, under command of Field Marshal von Hindenburg, has led to great\r\nresults. The army of General von Buelow, which on July 14 crossed the\r\nWindau River near and north of Kurshany, continued its victorious\r\nadvance. Eleven officers and 2,450 men were taken prisoners, and three\r\ncannon and five machine guns were captured.\r\n\r\nThe army of General von Gallwitz proceeded against the Russian\r\npositions in the district south and southeast of Olawa. After a\r\nbrilliant attack three Russian lines, situated behind each other\r\nnorthwest and northeast of Przasnysz, were pierced. Dzielin was\r\ncaptured and Lipa was reached and attacked by pressure exerted from\r\nboth these directions. The Russians retreated, after the evacuation of\r\nPrzasnysz on the 14th, to their line of defense from Ciechanow to\r\nKrasnosielo, lying behind them. On the 15th German troops also took\r\nthese enemy positions by storm, and pierced the position south of\r\nZielona, over a front of seven kilometers, forcing their opponents to\r\nretreat. They were supported by troops under General von Scholtz,\r\nwhich are occupied with a pursuit from the direction of Kolno. Since\r\nyesterday the Russians have been retreating on the center front,\r\nbetween the Pissa and Vistula Rivers, in the direction of Narew.\r\n\r\nSoutheastern Theatre of War.--After the Teutonic allies had taken\r\nduring the last few days a series of Russian positions on the River\r\nBug and between the Bug and the Vistula, important battles developed\r\nyesterday on this entire front under the leadership of Field Marshal\r\nvon Mackensen. West of the Vierpz, in the district southwest of\r\nKrasnostav, German troops broke through the enemy's line. So far 28\r\nofficers and 6,380 men have fallen into our hands, and 9 machine guns\r\nhave been captured.\r\n\r\nWest of the Upper Vistula the offensive has again been begun by the\r\narmy of General von Woyrich.\r\n\r\n_An official statement issued by general headquarters in Vienna on\r\nJuly 18 says:_\r\n\r\nOn the Bug River, in the region of Sokol, our troops drove the enemy\r\nfrom a series of stubbornly defended places. To the northeast of\r\nSienvno we broke through the Russian front.\r\n\r\nThe enemy is evacuating his positions between the Vistula and the\r\nKielce-Radom Railway.\r\n\r\n_An earlier bulletin, dated July 17, read as follows:_\r\n\r\nBetween the Vistula and the Bug Rivers important battles have\r\ndeveloped favorably for the allied troops. Some Austro-Hungarians,\r\noperating closely with the Germans west of Grabovetz, took an\r\nimportant enemy point of support after storming it several times, and\r\npressed forward into the enemy's main position.\r\n\r\nSouthwest of Krasnostav the Germans broke through the enemy's lines.\r\n\r\nOn the Upper Bystrcz and north of Krasnik our troops took advanced\r\npositions of the enemy. The offensive also was resumed successfully\r\nwest of the Vistula.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERLIN'S REJOICING\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch from Berlin via London on July 18 said:_\r\n\r\nThe news of Field Marshal von Hindenburg's newest surprise for the\r\nRussians, which the War Office announces has resulted in important\r\nvictories, was made known late yesterday, causing general rejoicing\r\nand the appearance of flags all over the city.\r\n\r\nMilitary critics attach great significance to the breaking of the\r\nRussian lines and the consequent Russian retreat toward the Narew\r\nRiver, particularly as the German advance between the Pissa and\r\nVistula rivers threatens to crumple the right flank positions of the\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\nWith Field Marshal von Mackensen proceeding against the other flank,\r\nthe maintenance of communications offers a serious problem for the\r\nRussians. The breaking of the Russian line near Krasnostav,\r\nthirty-four miles south of Lublin, brings the Germans dangerously near\r\nCholm and Lublin, both of which points are of the highest importance\r\nfor the Russians in maintaining their position in the Vistula region.\r\n\r\nThe following official bulletin concerning the operations was issued\r\ntonight by the War Office:\r\n\r\n     Portions of the army of General von Buelow have defeated the\r\n     Russian forces near Autz, where 3,620 men and six guns and\r\n     three machine guns were captured. They are pursuing the\r\n     enemy in an easterly direction.\r\n\r\n     Other portions of this army are fighting to the northeast of\r\n     Kurshany. East of that town an enemy advance position has\r\n     been stormed.\r\n\r\n     On the southeastern front the offensive was taken by the\r\n     army under General von Woyrich, which made successful\r\n     progress under the heavy fire of the enemy.\r\n\r\n     Our troops on Saturday morning took a narrow point in the\r\n     wire entanglements of a strongly fortified enemy main\r\n     position, and through this opening stormed an enemy trench\r\n     on a front of 2,000 meters (about a mile and a third). In\r\n     the course of the day the wedge was widened and pushed\r\n     forward, with tenacious hand-to-hand fighting, far into the\r\n     enemy's position.\r\n\r\n     In the evening the enemy's Moscow Grenadier Corps was\r\n     defeated by our landwehr and reserve troops. The enemy\r\n     retreated during the night behind the Iljanka River to the\r\n     district south of Zwolen, suffering heavy losses in their\r\n     retirement.\r\n\r\n     Between the Pissa and Vistula Rivers the Russian troops are\r\n     retreating and the troops of General von Schaltz and von\r\n     Gallwitz are close behind them.\r\n\r\n     The enemy is attacked and driven back where he offers\r\n     resistance in prepared positions.\r\n\r\n     Reserve troops and a levy of troops of General von Schaltz\r\n     have stormed the towns of Poremky and Wykplock, and\r\n     regiments of General von Gallwitz have broken through the\r\n     extended positions of Mlodzi, Nome and Kaniewo. The number\r\n     of prisoners was considerably increased and four guns were\r\n     captured.\r\n\r\n     From the north of the Vistula to the Pilica the Russians\r\n     also have begun to retreat. Our troops in a short engagement\r\n     during the pursuit made 620 prisoners.\r\n\r\n     Between the Upper Vistula and the Bug fighting continues\r\n     under the command of Field Marshal von Mackensen. The\r\n     Russians have been driven by the German troops from the\r\n     hills of Biclaczkowice, south of Piaski, as far as\r\n     Krosnoskow, and both these places have been taken by storm.\r\n     The fire of the Siberian army corps could not ward off\r\n     defeat. We made more than 1000 prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARSAW'S EVACUATION\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch from London dated July 20 recorded the\r\ndoubt in the English capital of Warsaw's holding out, as follows:_\r\n\r\nThe Morning Post's Budapest correspondent reports that the gradual\r\nevacuation of Warsaw has been ordered by the Russians.\r\n\r\nContinued successes of the great Teutonic movement against the Polish\r\ncapital were indicated in the German official bulletin received from\r\nBerlin this morning. This stated that the Russians were retreating\r\nalong the whole front between the Vistula and the Bug. The bulletin\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n     The Germans have occupied Tukum and Windau (Province of\r\n     Courland).\r\n\r\n     Between the Vistula and the Bug the battle continues with\r\n     unabated violence.\r\n\r\n     The Austro-Hungarians have forced a crossing of the Wolicza\r\n     River in the neighborhood of Grabovetz and advanced across\r\n     the Bug to the north of Sokal, the Russians having during\r\n     the night retreated along the whole front between the\r\n     Vistula and the Bug.\r\n\r\n     The Germans captured from July 16 to July 18 16,000\r\n     prisoners and twenty-three machine guns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scene of German operations in Courland]\r\n\r\nThat German columns have occupied Tukum, thirty-eight miles west of\r\nRiga, and Doblen eighteen miles west of Mitau, is admitted by an\r\nofficial statement issued at the headquarters of the Russian general\r\nstaff. The same report admits that the Austrians have gained the right\r\nbank of the Volitza and have crossed the Bug River on a front reaching\r\nto Sokal. The bulletin says:\r\n\r\n     On the Narew front the night of the 18th the enemy took the\r\n     offensive, capturing the village of Poredy, on the right\r\n     bank of the Pissa River. On the left bank of the Skwa enemy\r\n     attacks against the villages of Vyk and Pchetchniak were\r\n     repulsed with success. West of the Omulew our troops,\r\n     retiring progressively toward a bridgehead on the Narew,\r\n     delivered on the evening of the 17th a rearguard action of a\r\n     stubborn character near the town of Mahoff. Near the village\r\n     of Karnevo we made a brilliant counter-attack.\r\n\r\n     In the direction of Lublin enemy attacks during the 18th on\r\n     the front Wilkolaz-Vychawa (east and north of Krasnik) were\r\n     successfully repulsed.\r\n\r\n     At dawn of the 18th the enemy captured Krasnostav,\r\n     thirty-four miles south of Lublin on the Vieprz, and crossed\r\n     upstream. During the course of the 19th enemy attacks\r\n     between the stream flowing from Rybtchevbitze toward the\r\n     village of Piaski and the Vieprz remained without result. On\r\n     the right bank of the Vieprz we repulsed near Krasnostav\r\n     and the River Volitza many extremely stubborn enemy attacks.\r\n\r\n     Nevertheless, near the mouth of the Volitza and the village\r\n     of Gaevniki the enemy succeeded in establishing himself on\r\n     the right bank of this river, after which we judged it\r\n     advisable to retire to our second-line positions.\r\n\r\n     In the region of the village of Grabovetz on the 18th we\r\n     repulsed four furious enemy attacks on a wide front,\r\n     supported by a curtain of fire from his artillery.\r\n\r\n     Between Geneichva and the Bug on the evening of the 17th,\r\n     after a desperate fight we drove the enemy from all the\r\n     trenches previously occupied by him.\r\n\r\n     On the Bug energetic fighting continued against the enemy,\r\n     who crossed on the 18th on the front Skomorskhy-Sokal.\r\n\r\n\"Can Warsaw be held?\" is the question now being asked here.\r\n\r\nWith the German Field Marshals, von Hindenburg on the north and von\r\nMackensen on the south, whipping forward the two ends of a great arc\r\naround the city, it is realized in England that Grand Duke Nicholas,\r\nCommander in Chief of the Russian armies, has the most severe task\r\nimposed on him since the outbreak of the European war, and the\r\nmilitary writers of some of the London papers seem to think that the\r\ntask is well-nigh impossible.\r\n\r\nThere was sustained confidence that Germany's previous violent attacks\r\nalong the Bzura-Rawka front would never pierce the Russian line, but\r\nthe present colossal co-ordinate movement was developed with such\r\nsuddenness, and has been carried so far without meeting serious\r\nRussian resistance, that more and more the British press is\r\ndiscounting the fall of the Polish capital, and, while not giving up\r\nall hope of its retention, is pointing out the enormous difficulty the\r\nRussian armies have labored under from the start by the existence of\r\nsuch a salient.\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch from London on July 21 said:_\r\n\r\nFrom the shores of the Gulf of Riga in the north to that part of\r\nSouthern Poland into which they drove the Russians back from Galicia,\r\nthe Austro-German armies are still surging forward, and if Warsaw can\r\nbe denied them it will be almost a miracle.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the opinion even among those in England who\r\nheretofore have been hopeful that the Russians would turn and deliver\r\na counter-blow, and news of the evacuation of the Polish capital,\r\nfollowed by the triumphant entry of the Germans amid such scenes as\r\nwere enacted at Przemysl and Lemberg, would come as no surprise.\r\n\r\nThe German official statement, beginning at the northern tip of the\r\neastern battle line, records the progress of the German troops to\r\nwithin about fifty miles of Riga. Then, following the great battle arc\r\nsouthward, chronicles further successes in the sector northeast of\r\nWarsaw, culminating in the capture of Ostrolenka, one of the\r\nfortresses designed to shield the capital.\r\n\r\nThe acute peril to Warsaw is accentuated by the Russian official\r\ncommunication which says that German columns are within artillery\r\nrange of the fortress of Novo Georgievsk, the key to the capital from\r\nthe northwest, and only about twenty miles from it.\r\n\r\nImmediately southwest of the city, seventeen miles from it, Blonie has\r\nfallen, and further south Grojec, twenty-six miles distant, while\r\nGerman cavalry have captured Radom, capital of the province of that\r\nname, on the railroad to the great fortress of Ivangorod. The\r\nLublin-Chelm Railway is still in the hands of the Russians, so far as\r\nis known, but the Russian Commander-in-Chief has issued, through the\r\nCivil Governor, an order that in case of a retreat from the town of\r\nLublin, the male population is to attach itself to the retiring\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nThe belief is expressed in Danish military circles, according to a\r\nCopenhagen dispatch to the Exchange Telegraph Company, that the\r\nGermans intend to use Windau and Tukum as bases for operations\r\ndesigned to result in the capture of Riga, which would be used as a\r\nnew naval base after the Gulf of Riga had been cleared of mines.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTROLENKA FORT TAKEN\r\n\r\n_From Berlin on July 20 came this report from the German War Office:_\r\n\r\nEastern theatre of war: In Courland the Russians were repulsed near\r\nGrosschmarden, east of Tukum, and near Gruendorf and Usingen. East of\r\nKurshany the enemy also is retreating before our attack.\r\n\r\nNorth of Novgorod, on the Narew, German troops captured enemy\r\npositions north of the confluence of the Skroda and Pissa rivers.\r\nFresh Landsturm troops who were under fire for the first time\r\nespecially distinguished themselves. North of the mouth of the Skwa we\r\nreached the Narew. The permanent fortifications of Ostrolenka, on the\r\nnorthwest bank of the river, were captured.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Vistula our troops advanced into hostile positions to\r\nBlonie and Grojec. (Blonie is seventeen miles west of Warsaw, and\r\nGrojec twenty-six miles south of the city.) In rearguard fighting the\r\nRussians lost 560 prisoners and two machine guns.\r\n\r\nSoutheastern theatre of war: German Landwehr and reserve troops of the\r\narmy of General von Woyrich repulsed superior forces of the enemy from\r\ntheir position at Ilzanka. All counter attacks made by Russian\r\nreserves, which were brought up quickly, were repulsed. We captured\r\nmore than 5,000 prisoners. Our troops are closely pursuing the enemy.\r\nOur cavalry already has reached the railway line from Radom to\r\nIvangorod.\r\n\r\nBetween the upper Vistula and the Bug we are following the retreating\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n_A bulletin, issued early on July 20, had announced the capture of the\r\nBaltic port of Windau, thus bringing the Germans within a few miles of\r\nRiga, seat of the Governor General of the Baltic Provinces. It read:_\r\n\r\nGerman troops occupied Tukum and captured Windau. (Windau is a seaport\r\nin Courland on the Baltic Sea at the mouth of the Windau River, 100\r\nmiles northwest of Mitau.) Pursuing the enemy, who was defeated on the\r\nAa River at Alt Autz, our troops yesterday undiminished energy, and\r\nat some points report that progress has been made.\r\n\r\nThey are operating, however, through country which the retiring troops\r\nhave laid waste and in which what roads there are, are little suited\r\nfor the movement of the heavy artillery which is necessary for the\r\nbombardment of the great fortresses that bar their way.\r\n\r\nIt is not expected, therefore, that decisive actions on any of the\r\nfronts will be fought for a few days yet, although the battle between\r\nthe Vistula and the Bug Rivers, where the German Field Marshal von\r\nMackensen's army is advancing toward the Lublin-Chelm Railroad, has\r\nabout reached a climax. Here, according to the German official\r\ncommunication issued this afternoon, the Germans have succeeded in\r\nbreaking the obstinate resistance of the Russians at several points\r\nand forced them to retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval Losses During the War\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following diagram, compiled mainly from information given in a\r\nJune number of the Naval and Military Record and appearing in the\r\nLondon Morning Post of July 8, 1915, shows the different causes of\r\nloss to each side in tonnage of capital ships, gunboats, destroyers,\r\nsubmarines, torpedo-boats, and armed merchantmen to the end of May.\r\nThe diagram being drawn to scale the true proportion of each loss from\r\neach cause can be accurately gauged at a glance. It will be seen that\r\nthe Triple Entente and Japan have had no loss from capture or\r\ninternment, that the Entente's characteristic of fighting has been\r\n\"above board,\" _i.e._, by gunfire, while that of the enemy has been by\r\nsubmarines and mines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [diagram]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBattles in the West\r\n\r\nSir John French's Own Story\r\n\r\nFrance's \"Eyewitness\" Reports and Germany's Offensive in the Argonne\r\n\r\n     Since June 15, 1915, the British army, reinforced by\r\n     divisions of the \"new\" army now in France, has held\r\n     practically the same position on the front to the north and\r\n     south of Ypres. The subjoined report by Sir John French,\r\n     Commanding-in-Chief the British forces in France, published\r\n     July 12, covers the operations from April 5 down to June 15,\r\n     and deals particularly with the great poison-gas attacks by\r\n     the enemy, the capture and loss of Hill 60, the second\r\n     battle of Ypres, and the battle of Festubert. It embodies\r\n     the story by Sir Herbert Plumer of the terrible fighting\r\n     that began May 5. France's official reports, following, tell\r\n     of the battle of Hilgenfirst in the Vosges, the week's\r\n     battle in the Fecht valley, the 120 days' struggle between\r\n     Betlaine and Arras, and the battle of Fontenelle. The Crown\r\n     Prince's \"drive\" in the Argonne resulting in German\r\n     advantages is also dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE FIELD-MARSHAL COMMANDING-IN-CHIEF THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nTo the Secretary of State for War, War Office, London, S.W.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HEADQUARTERS,\r\nJune 15, 1915.\r\n\r\nMy Lord,\r\n\r\nI have the honor to report that since the date of my last dispatch\r\n(April 5, 1915) the Army in France under my command has been heavily\r\nengaged opposite both flanks of the line held by the British Forces.\r\n\r\n1. In the North the town and district of Ypres has once more in this\r\ncampaign been successfully defended against vigorous and sustained\r\nattacks made by large forces of the enemy and supported by a mass of\r\nheavy and field artillery, which, not only in number, but also in\r\nweight and caliber, is superior to any concentration of guns which has\r\npreviously assailed that part of the line.\r\n\r\nIn the South a vigorous offensive has again been taken by troops of\r\nthe First Army, in the course of which a large area of entrenched and\r\nfortified ground has been captured from the enemy, whilst valuable\r\nsupport has been afforded to the attack which our Allies have carried\r\non with such marked success against the enemy's positions to the east\r\nof Arras and Lens.\r\n\r\n2. I much regret that during the period under report the fighting has\r\nbeen characterized on the enemy's side by a cynical and barbarous\r\ndisregard of the well-known usages of civilized war and a flagrant\r\ndefiance of The Hague Convention.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In a long statement seeking to justify the use of\r\nasphyxiating gases in warfare the semi-official Wolff Telegraph Bureau\r\nasserted in German newspapers of June 25 that the Allies first used\r\nsuch gases against the Germans, and it cites French documents as proof\r\nthat France in February, months before the German advance at Ypres,\r\nmade extensive preparations for the application of gases and for\r\ncounteracting their effects on the attacking troops.\r\n\r\nAfter quoting the official German war report of April 16 that the\r\nFrench were making increased use of asphyxiating bombs, the statement\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"For every one who has kept an unbiased judgment, these official\r\nassertions of the strictly accurate and truthful German military\r\nadministration will be sufficient to prove the prior use of\r\nasphyxiating gases by our opponents. But let whoever still doubts\r\nconsider the following instructions for the systematic preparation of\r\nthis means of warfare by the French, issued by the French War\r\nMinistry, under date of Feb. 21, 1915:\r\n\r\n     Minister of War, Feb. 21, 1915.\r\n\r\n     Remarks concerning shells with stupefying gases:\r\n\r\n     The so-called shells with stupefying gases that are being\r\n     manufactured by our central factories contain a fluid which\r\n     streams forth after the explosion, in the form of vapors\r\n     that irritate the eyes, nose, and throat. There are two\r\n     kinds: hand grenades and cartridges.\r\n\r\n     Hand Grenades.--The grenades have the form of an egg; their\r\n     diameter in the middle is six centimeters, their height\r\n     twelve centimeters, their weight 400 grams. They are\r\n     intended for short distances, and have an appliance for\r\n     throwing by hand. They are equipped with an inscription\r\n     giving directions for use. They are lighted with a small bit\r\n     of material for friction pasted on the directions, after\r\n     which they must be thrown away. The explosion follows seven\r\n     seconds after lighting. A small cover of brass and a top\r\n     screwed on protect the lighted matter. Their purpose is to\r\n     make untenable the surroundings of the place where they\r\n     burst. Their effect is often considerably impaired by a\r\n     strong rising wind.\r\n\r\n     Cartridges.--The cartridges have a cylindrical form. Their\r\n     diameter is twenty-eight millimeters, their height ten\r\n     centimeters, their weight 200 grams. They are intended for\r\n     use at longer distances than can be negotiated with the hand\r\n     grenades. With an angle of twenty-five degrees at departure\r\n     they will carry 230 meters. They have central lighting\r\n     facilities and are fired with ignition bullet guns. The\r\n     powder lights a little internal ignition mass by means of\r\n     which the cartridges are caused to explode five seconds\r\n     after leaving the rifle. The cartridges have the same\r\n     purpose as the hand grenades but because of their very small\r\n     amount of fluid they must be fired in great numbers at the\r\n     same time.\r\n\r\n     Precautionary measures to be observed in attacks on trenches\r\n     into which shells with asphyxiating gases have been\r\n     thrown.--The vapors spread by means of the shells with\r\n     asphyxiating gases are not deadly, at least when small\r\n     quantities are used and their effect is only momentary. The\r\n     duration of the effect depends upon the atmospheric\r\n     conditions.\r\n\r\n     It is advisable therefore to attack the trenches into which\r\n     such hand grenades have been thrown and which the enemy has\r\n     nevertheless not evacuated before the vapors are completely\r\n     dissipated. The attacking troops, moreover, must wear\r\n     protective goggles and in addition be instructed that the\r\n     unpleasant sensations in nose and throat are not dangerous\r\n     and involve no lasting disturbance.\r\n\r\n\"Here we have a conclusive proof that the French in their State\r\nworkshops manufactured shells with asphyxiating gases fully half a\r\nyear ago at least,\" says the semi-official Telegraph Bureau. \"The\r\nnumber must have been so large that the French War Ministry at last\r\nfound itself obliged to issue written instructions concerning the use\r\nof this means of warfare. What hypocrisy when the same people grow\r\n'indignant' because the Germans much later followed them on the path\r\nthey had pointed out! Very characteristic is the twist of the French\r\nofficial direction: 'The vapors spread by the shells with asphyxiating\r\ngases are not deadly, at least not when used in small quantities.' It\r\nis precisely this limitation that contains the unequivocal confession\r\nthat the French asphyxiating gases work with deadly effect when used\r\nin large quantities.\"]\r\n\r\nAll the scientific resources of Germany have apparently been brought\r\ninto play to produce a gas of so virulent and poisonous a nature that\r\nany human being brought into contact with it is first paralyzed and\r\nthen meets with a lingering and agonizing death.\r\n\r\nThe enemy has invariably preceded, prepared and supported his attacks\r\nby a discharge in stupendous volume of these poisonous gas fumes\r\nwhenever the wind was favorable.\r\n\r\nSuch weather conditions have only prevailed to any extent in the\r\nneighborhood of Ypres, and there can be no doubt that the effect of\r\nthese poisonous fumes materially influenced the operations in that\r\ntheater, until experience suggested effective counter-measures, which\r\nhave since been so perfected as to render them innocuous.\r\n\r\nThe brain power and thought which has evidently been at work before\r\nthis unworthy method of making war reached the pitch of efficiency\r\nwhich has been demonstrated in its practice shows that the Germans\r\nmust have harbored these designs for a long time.\r\n\r\nAs a soldier I cannot help expressing the deepest regret and some\r\nsurprise that an Army which hitherto has claimed to be the chief\r\nexponent of the chivalry of war should have stooped to employ such\r\ndevices against brave and gallant foes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF HILL 60\r\n\r\n3. On the night of Saturday, April 17, a commanding hill which\r\nafforded the enemy excellent artillery observation toward the west\r\nand northwest was successfully mined and captured.\r\n\r\nThis hill, known as Hill 60, lies opposite the northern extremity of\r\nthe line held by the 2d Corps.\r\n\r\nThe operation was planned and the mining commenced by Major-General\r\nBulfin before the ground was handed over to the troops under\r\nLieutenant-General Sir Charles Fergusson, under whose supervision the\r\noperation was carried out.\r\n\r\nThe mines were successfully fired at 7 P.M. on the 17th inst., and\r\nimmediately afterwards the hill was attacked and gained, without\r\ndifficulty, by the 1st Battalion Royal West Kent Regiment and the 2d\r\nBattalion King's Own Scottish Borderers. The attack was well supported\r\nby the Divisional Artillery, assisted by French and Belgian batteries.\r\n\r\nDuring the night several of the enemy's counter-attacks were repulsed\r\nwith heavy loss, and fierce hand-to-hand fighting took place; but on\r\nthe early morning of the 18th the enemy succeeded in forcing back the\r\ntroops holding the right of the hill to the reverse slope, where,\r\nhowever, they hung on throughout the day.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 18th these two battalions were relieved by the\r\n2d Battalion West Riding Regiment and the 2d Battalion King's Own\r\nYorkshire Light Infantry, who again stormed the hill under cover of\r\nheavy artillery fire, and the enemy was driven off at the point of the\r\nbayonet.\r\n\r\nIn this operation fifty-three prisoners were captured, including four\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th and following days many unsuccessful attacks by the enemy\r\nwere made on Hill 60, which was continually shelled by heavy\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nOn May 1 another attempt to recapture Hill 60 was supported by great\r\nvolumes of asphyxiating gas, which caused nearly all the men along a\r\nfront of about 400 yards to be immediately struck down by its fumes.\r\n\r\nThe splendid courage with which the leaders rallied their men and\r\nsubdued the natural tendency to panic (which is inevitable on such\r\noccasions), combined with the prompt intervention of supports, once\r\nmore drove the enemy back.\r\n\r\nA second and more severe \"gas\" attack, under much more favorable\r\nweather conditions, enabled the enemy to recapture this position on\r\nMay 5.\r\n\r\nThe enemy owes his success in this last attack entirely to the use of\r\nasphyxiating gas. It was only a few days later that the means, which\r\nhave since proved so effective, of counteracting this method of making\r\nwar were put into practice. Had it been otherwise, the enemy's attack\r\non May 5 would most certainly have shared the fate of all the many\r\nprevious attempts he had made.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND BATTLE OF YPRES\r\n\r\n4. It was at the commencement of the second battle of Ypres on the\r\nevening of April 22, referred to in paragraph 1 of his report, that\r\nthe enemy first made use of asphyxiating gas.\r\n\r\nSome days previously I had complied with General Joffre's request to\r\ntake over the trenches occupied by the French, and on the evening of\r\nthe 22d the troops holding the lines east of Ypres were posted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nFrom Steenstraate to the east of Langemarck, as far as the\r\nPoelcappelle Road, a French Division.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The British battle line in Flanders, Belgium.]\r\n\r\nThence, in a south-easterly direction toward the\r\nPasschendaele-Becelaere Road, the Canadian Division.\r\n\r\nThence a Division took up the line in a southerly direction east of\r\nZonnebeke to a point west of Becelaere, whence another Division\r\ncontinued the line southeast to the northern limit of the Corps on its\r\nright.\r\n\r\nOf the 5th Corps there were four battalions in Divisional Reserve\r\nabout Ypres; the Canadian Division had one battalion of Divisional\r\nReserve and the 1st Canadian Brigade in Army Reserve. An Infantry\r\nBrigade, which had just been withdrawn after suffering heavy losses on\r\nHill 60, was resting about Vlamernighe.\r\n\r\nFollowing a heavy bombardment, the enemy attacked the French Division\r\nat about 5 P.M., using asphyxiating gases for the first time. Aircraft\r\nreported that at about 5 P.M. thick yellow smoke had been seen issuing\r\nfrom the German trenches between Langemarck and Bixschoote. The French\r\nreported that two simultaneous attacks had been made east of the\r\nYpres-Staden Railway, in which these asphyxiating gases had been\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Arras region, showing battle line and scene of\r\nfiercest battle in recent months.]\r\n\r\nWhat follows almost defies description. The effect of these poisonous\r\ngases was so virulent as to render the whole of the line held by the\r\nFrench Division mentioned above practically incapable of any action at\r\nall. It was at first impossible for any one to realize what had\r\nactually happened. The smoke and fumes hid everything from sight, and\r\nhundreds of men were thrown into a comatose or dying condition, and\r\nwithin an hour the whole position had to be abandoned, together with\r\nabout fifty guns.\r\n\r\nI wish particularly to repudiate any idea of attaching the least blame\r\nto the French Division for this unfortunate incident.\r\n\r\nAfter all the examples our gallant Allies have shown of dogged and\r\ntenacious courage in the many trying situations in which they have\r\nbeen placed throughout the course of this campaign it is quite\r\nsuperfluous for me to dwell on this aspect of the incident, and I\r\nwould only express my firm conviction that, if any troops in the world\r\nhad been able to hold their trenches in the face of such a treacherous\r\nand altogether unexpected onslaught, the French Division would have\r\nstood firm.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CANADIANS' PART\r\n\r\nThe left flank of the Canadian Division was thus left dangerously\r\nexposed to serious attack in flank, and there appeared to be a\r\nprospect of their being overwhelmed and of a successful attempt by the\r\nGermans to cut off the British troops occupying the salient to the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the danger to which they were exposed the Canadians held\r\ntheir ground with a magnificent display of tenacity and courage; and\r\nit is not too much to say that the bearing and conduct of these\r\nsplendid troops averted a disaster which might have been attended with\r\nthe most serious consequences.\r\n\r\nThey were supported with great promptitude by the reserves of the\r\ndivisions holding the salient and by a brigade which had been resting\r\nin billets.\r\n\r\nThroughout the night the enemy's attacks were repulsed, effective\r\ncounter-attacks were delivered, and at length touch was gained with\r\nthe French right, and a new line was formed.\r\n\r\nThe 2d London Heavy Battery, which had been attached to the Canadian\r\nDivision, was posted behind the right of the French Division, and,\r\nbeing involved in their retreat, fell into the enemy's hands. It was\r\nrecaptured by the Canadians in their counter-attack, but the guns\r\ncould not be withdrawn before the Canadians were again driven back.\r\n\r\nDuring the night I directed the Cavalry Corps and the Northumbrian\r\nDivision, which was then in general reserve, to move to the west of\r\nYpres, and placed these troops at the disposal of the General Officer\r\nCommanding the Second Army. I also directed other reserve troops from\r\nthe 3d Corps and the First Army to be held in readiness to meet\r\neventualities.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion of the gas and smoke the Germans succeeded in\r\ncapturing the bridge at Steenstraate and some works south of Lizerne,\r\nall of which were in occupation by the French.\r\n\r\nThe enemy having thus established himself to the west of the Ypres\r\nCanal, I was somewhat apprehensive of his succeeding in driving a\r\nwedge between the French and Belgian troops at this point. I directed,\r\ntherefore, that some of the reinforcements sent north should be used\r\nto support and assist General Putz, should he find difficulty in\r\npreventing any further advance of the Germans west of the canal.\r\n\r\nAt about ten o'clock on the morning of the 23d connection was finally\r\nensured between the left of the Canadian Division and the French\r\nright, about 800 yards east of the canal; but as this entailed the\r\nmaintenance by the British troops of a much longer line than that\r\nwhich they had held before the attack commenced on the previous night,\r\nthere were no reserves available for counter-attack until\r\nreinforcements, which were ordered up from the Second Army, were able\r\nto deploy to the east of Ypres.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 23d I went to see General Foch, and from\r\nhim I received a detailed account of what had happened, as reported by\r\nGeneral Putz. General Foch informed me that it was his intention to\r\nmake good the original line and regain the trenches which the French\r\nDivision had lost. He expressed the desire that I should maintain my\r\npresent line, assuring me that the original position would be\r\nre-established in a few days. General Foch further informed me that he\r\nhad ordered up large French reinforcements, which were now on their\r\nway, and that troops from the North had already arrived to reinforce\r\nGeneral Putz.\r\n\r\nI fully concurred in the wisdom of the General's wish to re-establish\r\nour old line, and agreed to co-operate in the way he desired,\r\nstipulating, however, that if the position was not re-established\r\nwithin a limited time I could not allow the British troops to remain\r\nin so exposed a situation as that which the action of the previous\r\ntwenty-four hours had compelled them to occupy.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the 23d the enemy's artillery was very active, and\r\nhis attacks all along the front were supported by some heavy guns\r\nwhich had been brought down from the coast in the neighborhood of\r\nOstend.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the guns on the night of the 22d prevented this fire from\r\nbeing kept down, and much aggravated the situation. Our positions,\r\nhowever, were well maintained by the vigorous counter-attacks made by\r\nthe 5th Corps.\r\n\r\nDuring the day I directed two brigades of the 3d Corps, and the Lahore\r\nDivision of the Indian Corps, to be moved up to the Ypres area and\r\nplaced at the disposal of the Second Army.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these two or three days many circumstances combined\r\nto render the situation east of the Ypres Canal very critical and most\r\ndifficult to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe confusion caused by the sudden retirement of the French Division,\r\nand the necessity for closing up the gap and checking the enemy's\r\nadvance at all costs, led to a mixing up of units and a sudden\r\nshifting of the areas of command, which was quite unavoidable. Fresh\r\nunits, as they came up from the South, had to be pushed into the\r\nfiring line in an area swept by artillery fire, which, owing to the\r\ncapture of the French guns, we were unable to keep down.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAVY CASUALTIES\r\n\r\nAll this led to very heavy casualties, and I wish to place on record\r\nthe deep admiration which I feel for the resource and presence of mind\r\nevinced by the leaders actually on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe parts taken by Major-General Snow and Brigadier-General Hull were\r\nreported to me as being particularly marked in this respect.\r\n\r\nAn instance of this occurred on the afternoon of the 24th, when the\r\nenemy succeeded in breaking through the line at St. Julien.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Hull, acting under the orders of Lieutenant-General\r\nAlderson, organized a powerful counter-attack with his own brigade and\r\nsome of the nearest available units. He was called upon to control,\r\nwith only his brigade staff, parts of battalions from six separate\r\ndivisions which were quite new to the ground. Although the attack did\r\nnot succeed in retaking St. Julien, it effectually checked the enemy's\r\nfurther advance.\r\n\r\nIt was only on the morning of the 25th that the enemy were able to\r\nforce back the left of the Canadian Division from the point where it\r\nhad originally joined the French line.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, and the early morning of the 25th, the enemy\r\ndirected a heavy attack against the Division at Broodseinde\r\ncross-roads, which was supported by a powerful shell fire, but he\r\nfailed to make any progress.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this time the town of Ypres and all the roads to\r\nthe East and West were uninterruptedly subjected to a violent\r\nartillery fire, but in spite of this the supply of both food and\r\nammunition was maintained throughout with order and efficiency.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon of the 25th many German prisoners were taken,\r\nincluding some officers. The hand-to-hand fighting was very severe,\r\nand the enemy suffered heavy loss.\r\n\r\nDuring the 26th the Lahore Division and a Cavalry Division were pushed\r\nup into the fighting line, the former on the right of the French, the\r\nlatter in support of the 5th Corps.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the Lahore Division, in conjunction with the French\r\nright, succeeded in pushing the enemy back some little distance toward\r\nthe north, but their further advance was stopped owing to the\r\ncontinual employment by the enemy of asphyxiating gas.\r\n\r\nOn the right of the Lahore Division the Northumberland Infantry\r\nBrigade advanced against St. Julien and actually succeeded in\r\nentering, and for a time occupying, the southern portion of that\r\nvillage. They were, however, eventually driven back, largely owing to\r\ngas, and finally occupied a line a short way to the south. This attack\r\nwas most successfully and gallantly led by Brigadier-General Riddell,\r\nwho, I regret to say, was killed during the progress of the operation.\r\n\r\nAlthough no attack was made on the southeastern side of the salient,\r\nthe troops operating to the east of Ypres were subjected to heavy\r\nartillery fire from this direction, which took some of the battalions,\r\nwhich were advancing north to the attack, in reverse.\r\n\r\nSome gallant attempts made by the Lahore Division on the 27th, in\r\nconjunction with the French, pushed the enemy further north; but they\r\nwere partially frustrated by the constant fumes of gas to which they\r\nwere exposed. In spite of this, however, a certain amount of ground\r\nwas gained.\r\n\r\nThe French had succeeded in retaking Lizerne, and had made some\r\nprogress at Steenstraate and Het Sas; but up to the evening of the\r\n28th no further progress had been made toward the recapture of the\r\noriginal line.\r\n\r\nI sent instructions, therefore, to Sir Herbert Plumer, who was now in\r\ncharge of the operation, to take preliminary measures for the\r\nretirement to the new line which had been fixed upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT ZEPPELIN\r\n\r\nInventor of the Air-ship that has Still to Demonstrate its Efficiency\r\nas an Engine of War]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL ERICH VON FALKENHAYN\r\n\r\nChief of the General Staff of the German Army\r\n\r\n(_Photo from Ruschin._)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRONG REINFORCEMENTS\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 29th I had another interview with General Foch,\r\nwho informed me that strong reinforcements were hourly arriving to\r\nsupport General Putz, and urged me to postpone issuing orders for any\r\nretirement until the result of his attack, which was timed to commence\r\nat daybreak on the 30th, should be known. To this I agreed, and\r\ninstructed Sir Herbert Plumer accordingly.\r\n\r\nNo substantial advance having been made by the French, I issued orders\r\nto Sir Herbert Plumer at one o'clock on May 1 to commence his\r\nwithdrawal to the new line.\r\n\r\nThe retirement was commenced the following night, and the new line was\r\noccupied on the morning of May 4.\r\n\r\nI am of opinion that this retirement, carried out deliberately with\r\nscarcely any loss, and in the face of an enemy in position, reflects\r\nthe greatest possible credit on Sir Herbert Plumer and those who so\r\nefficiently carried out his orders.\r\n\r\nThe successful conduct of this operation was the more remarkable from\r\nthe fact that on the evening of May 2, when it was only half\r\ncompleted, the enemy made a heavy attack, with the usual gas\r\naccompaniment, on St. Julien and the line to the west of it.\r\n\r\nAn attack on a line to the east of Fortuin was made at the same time\r\nunder similar conditions.\r\n\r\nIn both cases our troops were at first driven from their trenches by\r\ngas fumes, but on the arrival of the supporting battalions and two\r\nbrigades of a cavalry division, which were sent up in support from\r\nabout Potijze, all the lost trenches were regained at night.\r\n\r\nOn May 3, while the retirement was still going on, another violent\r\nattack was directed on the northern face of the salient. This was also\r\ndriven back with heavy loss to the enemy.\r\n\r\nFurther attempts of the enemy during the night of the 3d to advance\r\nfrom the woods west of St. Julien were frustrated entirely by the fire\r\nof our artillery.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the 4th the enemy heavily shelled the trenches we\r\nhad evacuated, quite unaware that they were no longer occupied. So\r\nsoon as the retirement was discovered the Germans commenced to\r\nentrench opposite our new line and to advance their guns to new\r\npositions. Our artillery, assisted by aeroplanes, caused him\r\nconsiderable loss in carrying out these operations.\r\n\r\nUp to the morning of the 8th the enemy made attacks at short\r\nintervals, covered by gas, on all parts of the line to the east of\r\nYpres, but was everywhere driven back with heavy loss.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole period since the first break of the line on the\r\nnight of April 22 all the troops in this area had been constantly\r\nsubjected to violent artillery bombardment from a large mass of guns\r\nwith an unlimited supply of ammunition. It proved impossible whilst\r\nunder so vastly superior fire of artillery to dig efficient trenches,\r\nor to properly reorganize the line, after the confusion and\r\ndemoralization called by the first great gas surprise and the\r\nsubsequent almost daily gas attacks. Nor was it until after this date\r\n(May 8) that effective preventatives had been devised and provided. In\r\nthese circumstances a violent bombardment of nearly the whole of the\r\n5th Corps front broke out at 7 A.M. on the morning of the 8th, which\r\ngradually concentrated on the front of the Division between north and\r\nsouth of Frezenberg. This fire completely obliterated the trenches and\r\ncaused enormous losses.\r\n\r\nThe artillery bombardment was shortly followed by a heavy infantry\r\nattack, before which our line had to give way.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR H. PLUMER'S STORY[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: General Sir Herbert Charles Onslow Plumer, K.C.B., was\r\nborn in 1857. He entered the York and Lancaster Regiment in 1876, and\r\nserved with distinction in the Sudan and South Africa. He was Q.M.G.\r\nand third military member of the Army Council, 1904-5, and commanded\r\nthe 5th Division Irish Command, 1906-9. He was knighted in 1906.]\r\n\r\nI relate what happened in Sir Herbert Plumer's own words:\r\n\r\n\"The right of one brigade was broken about 10.15 A.M.; then its\r\ncentre, and then part of the left of the brigade in the next section\r\nto the south. The Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry,\r\nhowever, although suffering very heavily, stuck to their fire or\r\nsupport trenches throughout the day. At this time two battalions were\r\nmoved to General Headquarters second line astride the Menin road to\r\nsupport and cover the left of their division.\r\n\r\n\"At 12.25 P.M. the center of a brigade further to the left also broke;\r\nits right battalion, however, the 1st Suffolks, which had been refused\r\nto cover a gap, still held on, and were apparently surrounded and\r\noverwhelmed. Meanwhile, three more battalions had been moved up to\r\nreinforce, two other battalions were moved up in support to General\r\nHeadquarters line and an infantry brigade came up to the grounds of\r\nVlamertinghe Chateau in corps reserve.\r\n\r\n\"At 11.30 A.M. a small party of Germans attempted to advance against\r\nthe left of the British line, but were destroyed by the 2d Essex\r\nRegiment.\r\n\r\n\"A counter-attack was launched at 3.30 P.M. by the 1st York and\r\nLancaster Regiment, 3d Middlesex Regiment, 2d East Surrey Regiment, 2d\r\nRoyal Dublin Fusiliers, and the 1st Royal Warwickshire Regiment. The\r\ncounter-attack reached Frezenberg, but was eventually driven back and\r\nheld up on a line running about north and south through Verlorenhoek,\r\ndespite repeated efforts to advance. The 12th London Regiment on the\r\nleft succeeded at great cost in reaching the original trench line, and\r\ndid considerable execution with their machine gun.\r\n\r\n\"The 7th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the 1st East Lancashire\r\nRegiment attacked in a northeasterly direction toward Wieltje, and\r\nconnected the old trench line with the ground gained by the\r\ncounter-attack, the line being consolidated during the night.\r\n\r\n\"During the night orders were received that two Cavalry Divisions\r\nwould be moved up and placed at the disposal of the 5th Corps, and a\r\nTerritorial Division would be moved up to be used if required.\r\n\r\n\"On the 9th the Germans again repeated their bombardment. Very heavy\r\nshell fire was concentrated for two hours on the trenches of the 2d\r\nGloucestershire Regiment and 2d Cameron Highlanders, followed by an\r\ninfantry attack which was successfully repulsed. The Germans again\r\nbombarded the salient, and a further attack in the afternoon succeeded\r\nin occupying 150 yards of trench. The Gloucesters counter-attacked,\r\nbut suffered heavily, and the attack failed. The salient being very\r\nexposed to shell fire from both flanks, as well as in front, it was\r\ndeemed advisable not to attempt to retake the trench at night, and a\r\nretrenchment was therefore dug across it.\r\n\r\n\"At 3 P.M. the enemy started to shell the whole front of the center\r\nDivision, and it was reported that the right Brigade of this Division\r\nwas being heavily punished, but continued to maintain its line.\r\n\r\n\"The trenches of the Brigades on the left center were also heavily\r\nshelled during the day and attacked by infantry. Both attacks were\r\nrepulsed.\r\n\r\n\"On the 10th instant the trenches on either side of the Menin-Ypres\r\nroad were shelled very severely all the morning. The 2d Cameron\r\nHighlanders, 9th Royal Scots, and the 3d and 4th King's Royal Rifles,\r\nhowever, repulsed an attack made, under cover of gas, with heavy loss.\r\nFinally, when the trenches had been practically destroyed and a large\r\nnumber of the garrison buried, the 3d King's Royal Rifles and 4th\r\nRifle Brigade fell back to the trenches immediately west of\r\nBellewaarde Wood. So heavy had been the shell fire that the proposal\r\nto join up the line with a switch through the wood had to be\r\nabandoned, the trees broken by the shells forming an impassable\r\nentanglement.\r\n\r\n\"After a comparatively quiet night and morning (10th-11th) the hostile\r\nartillery fire was concentrated on the trenches of the 2d Cameron\r\nHighlanders and 1st Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders at a slightly\r\nmore northern point than on the previous day. The Germans attacked in\r\nforce and gained a footing in part of the trenches, but were promptly\r\nejected by a supporting company of the 9th Royal Scots. After a second\r\nshort artillery bombardment the Germans again attacked about 5.15\r\nP.M., but were again repulsed by rifle and machine-gun fire. A third\r\nbombardment followed, and this time the Germans succeeded in gaining\r\na trench--or rather what was left of it--a local counter-attack\r\nfailing. However, during the night the enemy were again driven out.\r\nThe trench by this time being practically non-existent, the garrison\r\nfound it untenable under the very heavy shell fire the enemy brought\r\nto bear upon it, and the trench was evacuated. Twice more did the\r\nGerman snipers creep back into it, and twice more they were ejected.\r\nFinally, a retrenchment was made, cutting off the salient which had\r\nbeen contested throughout the day. It was won owing solely to the\r\nsuperior weight and number of the enemy's guns, but both our infantry\r\nand our artillery took a very heavy toll of the enemy, and the ground\r\nlost has proved of little use to the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"On the remainder of the front the day passed comparatively quietly,\r\nthough most parts of the line underwent intermittent shelling by guns\r\nof various calibers.\r\n\r\n\"With the assistance of the Royal Flying Corps the 31st Heavy Battery\r\nscored a direct hit on a German gun, and the North Midland Heavy\r\nBattery got on to some German howitzers with great success.\r\n\r\n\"With the exception of another very heavy burst of shell fire against\r\nthe right Division early in the morning the 12th passed uneventfully.\r\n\r\n\"On the night of the 12th-13th the line was reorganized, the center\r\nDivision retiring into Army Reserve to rest, and their places being\r\ntaken in the trenches by the two Cavalry Divisions; the Artillery and\r\nEngineers of the center Division forming with them what was known as\r\nthe 'Cavalry Force,' under the command of General De Lisle.\r\n\r\n\"On the 13th, the various reliefs having been completed without\r\nincident, the heaviest bombardment yet experienced broke out at 4.30\r\nA.M., and continued with little intermission throughout the day. At\r\nabout 7.45 A.M. the Cavalry Brigade astride the railway, having\r\nsuffered very severely, and their trenches having been obliterated,\r\nfell back about 800 yards. The North Somerset Yeomanry, on the right\r\nof the Brigade, although also suffering severely, hung on to their\r\ntrenches throughout the day, and actually advanced and attacked the\r\nenemy with the bayonet. The Brigade on its right also maintained its\r\nposition; as did also the Cavalry Division, except the left squadron,\r\nwhich, when reduced to sixteen men, fell back. The 2d Essex Regiment,\r\nrealizing the situation, promptly charged and retook the trench,\r\nholding it till relieved by the cavalry. Meanwhile a counter-attack by\r\ntwo cavalry brigades was launched at 2.30 P.M., and succeeded, in\r\nspite of very heavy shrapnel and rifle fire, in regaining the original\r\nline of trenches, turning out the Germans who had entered it, and in\r\nsome cases pursuing them for some distance. But a very heavy shell\r\nfire was again opened on them, and they were again compelled to retire\r\nto an irregular line in rear, principally the craters of shell holes.\r\nThe enemy in their counter-attack suffered very severe losses.\r\n\r\n\"The fighting in other parts of the line was little less severe. The\r\n1st East Lancashire Regiment were shelled out of their trenches, but\r\ntheir support company and the 2d Essex Regiment, again acting on their\r\nown initiative, won them back. The enemy penetrated into the farm at\r\nthe northeast corner of the line, but the 1st Rifle Brigade, after a\r\nsevere struggle, expelled them. The 1st Hampshire Regiment also\r\nrepelled an attack, and killed every German who got within fifty yards\r\nof their trenches. The 5th London Regiment, despite very heavy\r\ncasualties, maintained their position unfalteringly. At the southern\r\nend of the line the left brigade was once again heavily shelled, as\r\nindeed was the whole front. At the end of a very hard day's fighting,\r\nour line remained in its former position, with the exception of the\r\nshort distance lost by one cavalry division. Later, the line was\r\npushed forward, and a new line was dug in a less exposed position,\r\nslightly in rear of that originally held. The night passed quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Working parties of from 1,200 to 1,800 men have been found every\r\nnight by a Territorial Division and other units for work on rear\r\nlines of defence, in addition to the work performed by the garrisons\r\nin reconstructing the front line trenches which were daily destroyed\r\nby shell fire.\r\n\r\n\"The work performed by the Royal Flying Corps has been invaluable.\r\nApart from the hostile aeroplanes actually destroyed, our airmen have\r\nprevented a great deal of aerial reconnaissance by the enemy, and have\r\nregistered a large number of targets with our artillery.\r\n\r\n\"There have been many cases of individual gallantry. As instances, may\r\nbe given the following:\r\n\r\n\"During one of the heavy attacks made against our infantry gas was\r\nseen rolling forward from the enemy's trenches. Private Lynn, of the\r\n2d Lancashire Fusiliers, at once rushed to the machine-gun without\r\nwaiting to adjust his respirator. Single-handed he kept his gun in\r\naction the whole time the gas was rolling over, actually hoisting it\r\non the parapet to get a better field of fire. Although nearly\r\nsuffocated by the gas, he poured a stream of lead into the advancing\r\nenemy and checked their attack. He was carried to his dug-out, but,\r\nhearing another attack was imminent, he tried to get back to his gun.\r\nTwenty-four hours later he died in great agony from the effects of the\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n\"A young subaltern in a cavalry regiment went forward alone one\r\nafternoon to reconnoiter. He got into a wood 1,200 yards in front of\r\nour lines, which he found occupied by Germans, and came back with the\r\ninformation that the enemy had evacuated a trench and were digging\r\nanother--information which proved most valuable to the artillery as\r\nwell as to his own unit.\r\n\r\n\"A patrol of two officers and a non-commissioned officer of the 1st\r\nCambridgeshires went out one night to reconnoiter a German trench 350\r\nyards away. Creeping along the parapet of the trench they heard sounds\r\nindicating the presence of six or seven of the enemy. Further on they\r\nheard deep snores apparently proceeding from a dug-out immediately\r\nbeneath them. Although they knew that the garrison of the trench\r\noutnumbered them they decided to procure an identification.\r\nUnfortunately in pulling out a clasp knife with which to cut off the\r\nsleeper's identity disc, one of the officer's revolvers went off. A\r\nconversation in agitated whispers broke out in the German trench, but\r\nthe patrol crept safely away, the garrison being too startled to fire.\r\n\r\n\"Despite the very severe shelling to which the troops had been\r\nsubjected, which obliterated trenches and caused very many casualties,\r\nthe spirit of all ranks remains excellent. The enemy's losses,\r\nparticularly on May 10 and 13, have unquestionably been serious. On\r\nthe latter day they evacuated trenches (in face of the cavalry\r\ncounter-attack) in which were afterwards found quantities of equipment\r\nand some of their own wounded. The enemy have been seen stripping our\r\ndead, and on three occasions men in khaki have been seen advancing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJOINT BRITISH AND FRENCH ATTACKS\r\n\r\nThe fight went on by the exchange of desultory shell and rifle fire,\r\nbut without any remarkable incident until the morning of May 24.\r\nDuring this period, however, the French on our left had attained\r\nconsiderable success. On May 15 they captured Steenstraate and the\r\ntrenches in Het Sas, and on May 16 they drove the enemy headlong over\r\nthe canal, finding 2,000 German dead. On May 17 they made a\r\nsubstantial advance on the east side of the canal, and on May 20 they\r\nrepelled a German counter-attack, making a further advance in the same\r\ndirection, and taking 100 prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn the early morning of May 24 a violent outburst of gas against\r\nnearly the whole front was followed by heavy shell fire, and the most\r\ndetermined attack was delivered against our position east of Ypres.\r\n\r\nThe hour the attack commenced was 2.45 A.M. A large proportion of the\r\nmen were asleep, and the attack was too sudden to give them time to\r\nput on their respirators.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Royal Irish and the 9th Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders,\r\novercome by gas fumes, were driven out of a farm held in front of the\r\nleft Division, and this the enemy proceeded to hold and fortify.\r\n\r\nAll attempts to retake this farm during the day failed, and during the\r\nnight of May 24-25 the General Officer Commanding the left Division\r\ndecided to take up a new line which, although slightly in rear of the\r\nold one, he considered to be a much better position. This operation\r\nwas successfully carried out.\r\n\r\nThroughout the day the whole line was subjected to one of the most\r\nviolent artillery attacks which it had ever undergone; and the 5th\r\nCorps and the Cavalry Divisions engaged had to fight hard to maintain\r\ntheir positions. On the following day, however, the line was\r\nconsolidated, joining the right of the French at the same place as\r\nbefore, and passing through Wieltje (which was strongly fortified) in\r\na southerly direction on to Hooge, where the cavalry have since\r\nstrongly occupied the chateau, and pushed our line further east.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of a promise which I made to the French\r\nCommander-in-Chief to support an attack which his troops were making\r\non May 9 between the right of my line and Arras, I directed Sir\r\nDouglas Haig to carry out on that date an attack on the German\r\ntrenches in the neighborhood of Rougebanc (northwest of Fromelles) by\r\nthe 4th Corps, and between Neuve Chapelle and Givenchy by the 1st and\r\nIndian Corps.\r\n\r\nThe bombardment of the enemy's positions commenced at 5 A.M.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later the 8th Division of the 4th Corps captured the\r\nfirst line of German trenches about Rougebanc, and some detachments\r\nseized a few localities beyond this line. It was soon found, however,\r\nthat the position was much stronger than had been anticipated and that\r\na more extensive artillery preparation was necessary to crush the\r\nresistance offered by his numerous fortified posts.\r\n\r\nThroughout May 9 and 10 repeated efforts were made to make further\r\nprogress. Not only was this found to be impossible, but the violence\r\nof the enemy's machine-gun fire from his posts on the flanks rendered\r\nthe captured trenches so difficult to hold that all the units of the\r\n4th Corps had to retire to their original position by the morning of\r\nMay 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL PLAN OF ATTACK\r\n\r\nThe 1st and Indian Divisions south of Neuve Chapelle met with no\r\ngreater success, and on the evening of May 10 I sanctioned Sir Douglas\r\nHaig's proposal to concentrate all our available resources on the\r\nsouthern point of attack.\r\n\r\nThe 7th Division was moved round from the 4th Corps area to support\r\nthis attack, and I directed the General Officer Commanding the First\r\nArmy to delay it long enough to insure a powerful and deliberate\r\nartillery preparation.\r\n\r\nThe operations of May 9 and 10 formed part of a general plan of attack\r\nwhich the Allies were conjointly conducting on a line extending from\r\nthe north of Arras to the south of Armentieres; and, although\r\nimmediate progress was not made during this time by the British\r\nforces, their attack assisted in securing the brilliant successes\r\nattained by the French forces on their right, not only by holding the\r\nenemy in their front, but by drawing off a part of the German\r\nreinforcements which were coming up to support their forces east of\r\nArras.\r\n\r\nOn May 15 I moved the Canadian Division into the 1st Corps area and\r\nplaced them at the disposal of Sir Douglas Haig.\r\n\r\nThe infantry of the Indian Corps and the 2d Division of the 1st Corps\r\nadvanced to the attack of the enemy's trenches which extended from\r\nRichebourg L'Avoue in a south-westerly direction.\r\n\r\nBefore daybreak the 2d Division had succeeded in capturing two lines\r\nof the enemy's trenches, but the Indian Corps were unable to make any\r\nprogress owing to the strength of the enemy's defenses in the\r\nneighborhood of Richebourg L'Avoue.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF FESTUBERT\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the 7th Division, on the night of the 2d, advanced to the\r\nattack, and by 7 A.M. had entrenched themselves on a line running\r\nnearly north and south, halfway between their original trenches and La\r\nQuinque Rue, having cleared and captured several lines of the enemy's\r\ntrenches, including a number of fortified posts.\r\n\r\nAs it was found impossible for the Indian Corps to make any progress\r\nin face of the enemy's defenses, Sir Douglas Haig directed the attack\r\nto be suspended at this point and ordered the Indian Corps to form a\r\ndefensive flank.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the day was spent in securing and consolidating\r\npositions which had been won, and endeavoring to unite the inner\r\nflanks of the 7th and 2d Divisions, which were separated by trenches\r\nand posts strongly held by the enemy.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts which were made throughout the day to secure this\r\nobject had not succeeded at nightfall in driving the enemy back.\r\n\r\nThe German communications leading to the rear of their positions were\r\nsystematically shelled throughout the night.\r\n\r\nAbout 200 prisoners were captured on May 16.\r\n\r\nFighting was resumed at daybreak; and by eleven o'clock the 7th\r\nDivision had made a considerable advance, capturing several more of\r\nthe enemy's trenches. The task allotted to this Division was to push\r\non in the direction of Rue D'Ouvert, Chateau St. Roch and Canteleux.\r\n\r\nThe 2d Division was directed to push on when the situation permitted\r\ntoward the Rue de Marais and Violaines.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Division was ordered to extend its front far enough to\r\nenable it to keep touch with the left of the 2d Division when they\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nOn this day I gave orders for the 51st (Highland) Division to move\r\ninto the neighborhood of Estaires to be ready to support the\r\noperations of the First Army.\r\n\r\nAt about noon the enemy was driven out of the trenches and posts which\r\nhe occupied between the two Divisions, the inner flanks of which were\r\nthus enabled to join hands.\r\n\r\nBy nightfall the 2d and 7th Divisions had made good progress, the area\r\nof captured ground being considerably extended to the right by the\r\nsuccessful operations of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe state of the weather on the morning of May 18 much hindered an\r\neffective artillery bombardment, and further attacks had,\r\nconsequently, to be postponed.\r\n\r\nInfantry attacks were made throughout the line in the course of the\r\nafternoon and evening, but, although not very much progress was made,\r\nthe line was advanced to the La Quinque Rue-Bethune Road before\r\nnightfall.\r\n\r\nOn May 19 the 7th and 2d Divisions were drawn out of the line to rest.\r\nThe 7th Division was relieved by the Canadian Division and the 2d\r\nDivision by the 51st (Highland) Division.\r\n\r\nSir Douglas Haig placed the Canadian and 51st Divisions, together with\r\nthe artillery of the 2d and 7th Divisions, under the command of\r\nLieutenant-General Alderson, whom he directed to conduct the\r\noperations which had hitherto been carried on by the General Officer\r\nCommanding First Corps; and he directed the 7th Division to remain in\r\nArmy Reserve.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of May 19-20 a small post of the enemy in front of La\r\nQuinque Rue was captured.\r\n\r\nDuring the night of May 20-21 the Canadian Division brilliantly\r\ncarried on the excellent progress made by the 7th Division by seizing\r\nseveral of the enemy's trenches and pushing forward their whole line\r\nseveral hundred yards. A number of prisoners and some machine guns\r\nwere captured.\r\n\r\nOn May 22 the 51st (Highland) Division was attached to the Indian\r\nCorps, and the General Officer Commanding the Indian Corps took charge\r\nof the operations at La Quinque Rue, Lieutenant-General Alderson with\r\nthe Canadians conducting the operations to the north of that place.\r\n\r\nOn this day the Canadian Division extended their line slightly to the\r\nright and repulsed three very severe hostile counter-attacks.\r\n\r\nOn May 24 and 25 the 47th Division (2d London Territorial) succeeded\r\nin taking some more of the enemy's trenches and making good the\r\nground gained to the east and north.\r\n\r\nI had now reason to consider that the battle, which was commenced by\r\nthe First Army on May 9 and renewed on May 16, having attained for the\r\nmoment the immediate object I had in view, should not be further\r\nactively proceeded with; and I gave orders to Sir Douglas Haig to\r\ncurtail his artillery attack and to strengthen and consolidate the\r\nground he had won.\r\n\r\nIn the battle of Festubert above described the enemy was driven from a\r\nposition which was strongly entrenched and fortified, and ground was\r\nwon on a front of four miles to an average depth of 600 yards.\r\n\r\nThe enemy is known to have suffered very heavy losses, and in the\r\ncourse of the battle 785 prisoners and ten machine guns were captured.\r\nA number of machine guns were also destroyed by our fire.\r\n\r\nDuring the period under report the Army under my command has taken\r\nover trenches occupied by some other French divisions.\r\n\r\nI am much indebted to General D'Urbal, commanding the 10th French\r\nArmy, for the valuable and efficient support received throughout the\r\nbattle of Festubert from three groups of French 75 centimetre guns.\r\n\r\nIn spite of very unfavorable weather conditions, rendering observation\r\nmost difficult, our own artillery did excellent work throughout the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the successful attempts to deceive the enemy in this\r\nrespect it may be mentioned that on the afternoon of May 24 a\r\nbombardment of about an hour was carried out by the 6th Division with\r\nthe object of distracting attention from the Ypres salient.\r\n\r\nConsiderable damage was done to the enemy's parapets and wire; and\r\nthat the desired impression was produced on the enemy is evident from\r\nthe German wireless news on that day, which stated, \"West of Lille the\r\nEnglish attempts to attack were nipped in the bud.\"\r\n\r\nI have much pleasure in again expressing my warm appreciation of the\r\nadmirable manner in which all branches of the Medical Services now in\r\nthe field, under the direction of Surgeon-General Sir Arthur Sloggett,\r\nhave met and dealt with the many difficult situations resulting from\r\nthe operations during the last two months.\r\n\r\nThe medical units at the front were frequently exposed to the enemy's\r\nfire, and many casualties occurred amongst the officers of the\r\nregimental Medical Service. At all times the officers, non-commissioned\r\nofficers and men, and nurses carried out their duties with fearless\r\nbravery and great devotion to the welfare of the sick and wounded.\r\n\r\nThe whole organization of the Medical Services reflects the highest\r\ncredit on all concerned.\r\n\r\nI have once more to call your Lordship's attention to the part taken\r\nby the Royal Flying Corps in the general progress of the campaign, and\r\nI wish particularly to mention the invaluable assistance they rendered\r\nin the operations described in this report, under the able direction\r\nof Major-General Sir David Henderson.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Flying Corps is becoming more and more an indispensable\r\nfactor in combined operations. In co-operation with the artillery, in\r\nparticular, there has been continuous improvement both in the methods\r\nand in the technical material employed. The ingenuity and technical\r\nskill displayed by the officers of the Royal Flying Corps in effecting\r\nthis improvement have been most marked.\r\n\r\nSince my last dispatch there has been a considerable increase both in\r\nthe number and in the activity of German aeroplanes in our front.\r\nDuring this period there have been more than sixty combats in the air,\r\nin which not one British aeroplane has been lost. As these flights\r\ntake place almost invariably over or behind the German lines, only one\r\nhostile aeroplane has been brought down in our territory. Five more,\r\nhowever, have been definitely wrecked behind their own lines, and many\r\nhave been chased down and forced to land in most unsuitable ground.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the opposition of hostile aircraft, and the great number\r\nof anti-aircraft guns employed by the enemy, air reconnaissance has\r\nbeen carried out with regularity and accuracy.\r\n\r\nI desire to bring to your Lordship's notice the assistance given by\r\nthe French military authorities, and in particular by General\r\nHirschauer, Director of the French Aviation Service, and his\r\nassistants, Colonel Bottieaux and Colonel Stammler, in the supply of\r\naeronautical material, without which the efficiency of the Royal\r\nFlying Corps would have been seriously impaired.\r\n\r\nIn this dispatch I wish again to remark upon the exceptionally good\r\nwork done throughout this campaign by the Army Service Corps and by\r\nthe Army Ordnance Department, not only in the field, but also on the\r\nlines of communication and at the base ports.\r\n\r\nTo foresee and meet the requirements in the matter of ammunition,\r\nstores, equipment, supplies, and transport has entailed on the part of\r\nthe officers, non-commissioned officers and men of these services a\r\nsustained effort which has never been relaxed since the beginning of\r\nthe war, and which has been rewarded by the most conspicuous success.\r\n\r\nThe close co-operation of the Railway Transport Department, whose\r\nexcellent work, in combination with the French Railway Staff, has\r\nensured the regularity of the maintenance services, has greatly\r\ncontributed to this success.\r\n\r\nThe degree of efficiency to which these services have been brought was\r\nwell demonstrated in the course of the second battle of Ypres.\r\n\r\nThe roads between Poperinghe and Ypres, over which transport, supply\r\nand ammunition columns had to pass, were continually searched by\r\nhostile heavy artillery during the day and night; whilst the passage\r\nof the canal through the town of Ypres, and along the roads east of\r\nthat town, could only be effected under most difficult and dangerous\r\nconditions as regards hostile shell fire. Yet, throughout the whole\r\nfive or six weeks during which these conditions prevailed the work was\r\ncarried on with perfect order and efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"NEW\" BRITISH ARMY\r\n\r\nSince the date of my last report some divisions of the \"New\" Army have\r\narrived in this country.\r\n\r\nI made a close inspection of one division, formed up on parade, and\r\nhave at various times seen several units belonging to others.\r\n\r\nThese divisions have as yet had very little experience in actual\r\nfighting; but, judging from all I have seen, I am of opinion that they\r\nought to prove a valuable addition to any fighting force.\r\n\r\nAs regards the infantry, their physique is excellent, whilst their\r\nbearing and appearance on parade reflects great credit on the officers\r\nand staffs responsible for their training. The units appear to be\r\nthoroughly well officered and commanded. The equipment is in good\r\norder and efficient.\r\n\r\nSeveral units of artillery have been tested in the firing line behind\r\nthe trenches, and I hear very good reports of them. Their shooting has\r\nbeen extremely good, and they are quite fit to take their places in\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer Battalions have created a very favorable impression, the\r\nofficers being keen and ingenious, and the men of good physique and\r\ngood diggers. The equipment is suitable. The training in field works\r\nhas been good, but, generally speaking, they require the assistance of\r\nRegular Royal Engineers as regards laying out of important works. Man\r\nfor man in digging the battalions should do practically the same\r\namount of work as an equivalent number of sappers, and in riveting,\r\nentanglements, etc., a great deal more than the ordinary infantry\r\nbattalions.\r\n\r\nDuring the months of April and May several divisions of the\r\nTerritorial Force joined the Army under my command.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that these troops have now reached a standard of\r\nefficiency which enables them to be usefully employed in complete\r\ndivisional units.\r\n\r\nSeveral divisions have been so employed; some in the trenches, others\r\nin the various offensive and defensive operations reported in this\r\ndispatch.\r\n\r\nIn whatever kind of work these units have been engaged, they have all\r\nborne an active and distinguished part, and have proved themselves\r\nthoroughly reliable and efficient.\r\n\r\nThe opinion I have expressed in former dispatches as to the use and\r\nvalue of the Territorial Force has been fully justified by recent\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister was kind enough to accept an invitation from me to\r\nvisit the Army in France, and arrived at my Headquarters on May 30.\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith made an exhaustive tour of the front, the hospitals and\r\nall the administrative arrangements made by Corps Commanders for the\r\nhealth and comfort of men behind the trenches.\r\n\r\nIt was a great encouragement to all ranks to see the Prime Minister\r\namongst them; and the eloquent words which on several occasions he\r\naddressed to the troops had a most powerful and beneficial effect.\r\n\r\nAs I was desirous that the French Commander-in-Chief should see\r\nsomething of the British troops, I asked General Joffre to be kind\r\nenough to inspect a division on parade.\r\n\r\nThe General accepted my invitation, and on May 27 he inspected the 7th\r\nDivision, under the command of Major-General H. de la P. Gough, C.B.,\r\nwhich was resting behind the trenches.\r\n\r\nGeneral Joffre subsequently expressed to me in a letter the pleasure\r\nit gave him to see the British troops, and his appreciation of their\r\nappearance on parade. He requested me to make this known to all\r\nranks.\r\n\r\nThe Moderator of the Church of Scotland, the Right Rev. Dr. Wallace\r\nWilliamson, Dean of the Order of the Thistle, visited the Army in\r\nFrance between May 7 and 17, and made a tour of the Scottish regiments\r\nwith excellent results.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the constant strain put upon them by the arduous nature of\r\nthe fighting which they are called upon to carry out daily and almost\r\nhourly, the spirit which animates all ranks of the Army in France\r\nremains high and confident.\r\n\r\nThey meet every demand made upon them with the utmost cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nThis splendid spirit is particularly manifested by the men in\r\nhospital, even amongst those who are mortally wounded.\r\n\r\nThe invariable question which comes from lips hardly able to utter a\r\nsound is, \"How are things going on at the front?\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I desire to bring to your Lordship's special notice the\r\nvaluable services rendered by General Sir Douglas Haig in his\r\nsuccessful handling of the troops of the First Army throughout the\r\nBattle of Festubert, and Lieutenant-General Sir Herbert Plumer for his\r\nfine defence of Ypres throughout the arduous and difficult operations\r\nduring the latter part of April and the month of May.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be your Lordship's most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.D.P. FRENCH,\r\nField-Marshal, Commanding-in-Chief,\r\nthe British Army in France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance's \"Eyewitness\" Reports\r\n\r\n\r\nHILGENFIRST\r\n\r\n_The following details published in Paris on July 11 by an official\r\n\"Eyewitness\" with the French army of the desperate fighting which\r\nresulted in the capture of the summit of Hilgenfirst, more than 3,000\r\nfeet high, in the Langenfeldkopf region, in the Vosges Mountains, are\r\ngiven in an account of the struggle written by an official eyewitness\r\nwith the French army._\r\n\r\nIn the fight for the capture of the eminence of Hilgenfirst, one\r\ncompany of our advance guard which forced a breach in the German lines\r\nwas cut off from its battalion as the result of a German\r\ncounter-attack. This company, nevertheless, succeeded in maintaining\r\nthe conquered position four days until finally relieved.\r\n\r\nOn June 14 the Sixth Company of the Seventh Battalion crawled from its\r\ntrenches and deployed toward a clearing in the woods opposite. It then\r\ncharged, taking the German trenches. The Germans fled to the woods,\r\nleaving a quick-firer. Our men immediately began fortifying the\r\nposition, but our sentries reported that German patrols had been seen\r\nencircling the French. Other companies were ordered forward\r\nimmediately to support the one in the trench.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile large German reinforcements had been brought up, making it\r\nimpossible to reach our men. The captain in the trench, realizing that\r\nhe was surrounded, ordered some of his men to form a hollow square and\r\ndefend the position while others dug trenches on four sides. The\r\nGermans attacked in great force with quick firers and rifles, but\r\nwithdrew at nightfall after a battle lasting two hours. Our men\r\ndefending the position numbered 137, including five officers. One\r\nofficer and twenty-seven men were wounded.\r\n\r\nThe following day, despite a well-directed fire from our main\r\npositions, the Germans again attacked in large numbers, advancing in\r\ncolumns of four. The situation now began to look critical, but at the\r\ncrucial moment a hail of shrapnel from our 75.8 completely decimated\r\none advancing column. The edge of the wood out of which the column\r\nadvanced was piled high with German bodies and the remainder of the\r\nforce scattered in flight.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the Germans again prepared for an attack, but the\r\nattempt was frustrated by our infantry fire. During the night the\r\ncaptain told off men to rest in squads, the others being constantly on\r\nthe alert. At dawn a second lieutenant and a few men surprised a small\r\nGerman scouting detachment of twenty men commanded by a\r\nnon-commissioned officer. Our men threw themselves upon the Germans,\r\nkilling the officer and two men, the others taking to their heels at\r\ntop speed.\r\n\r\nAt 10 o'clock the main body of our troops succeeded in establishing\r\ncommunications with the isolated company which called for help in the\r\nprovincial dialect. We answered that we would attack at nightfall, but\r\nthat the attack would be preceded by a heavy bombardment.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they constructed heavy bomb-proof shelters on the four\r\nsides of the square and anxiously waited. At 9 o'clock the attack was\r\nbegun with artillery, quick firers and rifles, but it was insufficient\r\nto drive out the Germans, who had in the meanwhile established\r\nwell-protected trenches and, with an excellent telephone system, made\r\nany surprise movement impossible.\r\n\r\nThe company's rations were now becoming very low. Delirious cries of\r\nthe wounded added to the discomfiture of the men. The following\r\nmorning a German patrol tried to take the position by storm, and some\r\nof the men succeeded even in mounting the parapet. These were driven\r\noff by a quick firer which had been captured from the Germans. On\r\nother advancing troops of the enemy huge boulders, dug from the\r\nhillside, were rolled down and we succeeded in dispersing the attack.\r\n\r\nAnother attack was prepared by us for that night, but the danger was\r\ngreat on account of the narrowness of the position occupied by the\r\ncompany. The captain of the company was ordered to light fires at the\r\nopposite ends of his position, so that our artillery could better\r\nregulate its fire, as there was great danger of killing our own men.\r\n\r\nThe artillery opened a crushing fire, and the Germans began to\r\nretreat. As they passed the company's position their men were mowed\r\ndown by the exactness of the fire of our troops, and finally the brave\r\ncompany was delivered.\r\n\r\nThe general in command of the army in the Vosges said, in\r\ncomplimenting the men for their bravery, the company henceforth should\r\nbe called \"Company Sid Ibrahim.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battle line in the Vosges, July 20]\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF FONTENELLE\r\n\r\n_The official French \"Eyewitness\" at the front reported on July 18\r\ngiving details of the French success in the battle of Fontenelle, in\r\nthe Vosges. The scene of the conflict is in the neighborhood of the\r\nvillage of Senones and the forest of Ormont, and the ground is\r\ndescribed as undulating and cut by deep ravines._\r\n\r\n_It was in this region, says the observer, that the Germans, after the\r\nbattle of the Marne, look up a position on a summit commanding the\r\nsurrounding countryside. This hill was Height 627, which is known as\r\nFontenelle._\r\n\r\nOn June 22, after severe losses, the enemy succeeded in occupying\r\nFontenelle, says the observer. Although we counter-attacked\r\nvigorously, taking 142 prisoners, the enemy held the summit. General\r\nVan Kuderzen, in a report dated July 3, said that after a careful\r\ninspection of the German works and trenches he finally believed that\r\nthe hill had been transformed into an impregnable fortress, and that\r\nits capture would necessitate tremendous losses.\r\n\r\nOn July 8 all necessary preparations for the attack had been\r\ncompleted. The same day, at nightfall, three columns, aided by a\r\nremarkably accurate artillery fire, took a portion of the enemy's\r\ntrenches. In the center we also attacked, forcing the enemy to the\r\nwest of Launois in ten minutes. The attack on the left proceeded more\r\nslowly, but, aided by gathering darkness, we took possession of the\r\nnorthwestern portion of the hill.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak not only the whole of the summit had been retaken, but a\r\nmajority of the German defenses as far as the road from Launois to\r\nMoyen-Moutier. Thanks to our artillery, all preparations for\r\ncounter-attacks were immediately stopped.\r\n\r\nDuring the battles of July 8 and 9 we took 881 prisoners, including 21\r\nofficers. When questioned the prisoners gave great praise to our\r\nexcellent artillery marksmanship, saying: \"We did not believe there\r\ncould be such a hell of fire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBETWEEN BETHUNE AND ARRAS\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch dated on the heights of Notre Dame de\r\nLorette, near Arras, July 10, gave the following account of the 120\r\ndays' fight ended successfully by the use of high explosives:_\r\n\r\nAfter fighting 120 days for the hill country between Bethune and\r\nArras, the French forces are in possession of all the eminences\r\nlooking out upon the plain of Flanders. Lille, Douai, and Chambrai all\r\nare visible from here.\r\n\r\nEvery position along the broad national road between Arras and Bethune\r\nhas been won except Souchez, and last night another quarter mile of\r\ntrenches in the Souchez web was torn away. The attack was made under\r\nparachute rocket lights, the French burning bluish white and the\r\nGermans greenish white, covering the scene of the desperate conflict\r\nwith a ghastly glow.\r\n\r\nThe most desperate fighting has been along the short ten-mile front\r\nfrom Arras to Aix-Noulette, which began March 9 with the taking of a\r\nfew hundred yards of trenches on the watershed of Notre Dame de\r\nLorette, where there are the ruins of an old Merovingian military\r\nroad. Every day since then some section of the German trenches has\r\nbeen taken, lost, or retaken.\r\n\r\nEach side has been employing formidable artillery both of small and\r\nheavy calibre, the French guns being somewhat more numerous and served\r\nwith unlimited quantities of high explosive shells.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of The Associated Press today went through five or six\r\nmiles of the trenches formerly held by the Germans and reconstructed\r\nby the French, who now have abandoned them to move forward. Upward of\r\n100,000 Germans have fallen or been captured in these trenches,\r\naccording to the French official count, since the second week of\r\nMarch. The French losses, the correspondent was confidentially\r\ninformed, while serious, have been much smaller than those of the\r\nGermans. There are thickets of little crosses made of twigs tied\r\ntogether, marking the graves between the trenches. Some of these\r\ngraves have been torn up by the shell fire.\r\n\r\nAlmost every square yard of this region is marked by miniature craters\r\ncaused by exploding shells. Spots where shells penetrated the earth\r\nwithout exploding are indicated by signs bearing the words \"Live\r\nShell.\"\r\n\r\nOne line of the German works was just below the summit of a steep\r\nslope which, from the nature of the ground, could not be shelled\r\nwithout danger to the French position a little higher up. The Germans\r\nwere sheltered in dugouts under the hillside, and their French\r\nassailants, sliding or jumping down into the trenches, were shot or\r\nbayoneted from caves. The line was finally taken by tossing grenades\r\nby the basketful into the trenches until most of the defenders in the\r\nconcaved shelters were killed or wounded. Every curve or angle in the\r\nmiles of labyrinthine cuttings has its story of tragedy and heroism.\r\n\r\nIn the party which went over this ground and into the firing trenches\r\nwithin calling distance of the German lines with The Associated Press\r\ncorrespondent were Owen Johnson, Arnold Bennett, Walter Hale and\r\nGeorge H. Mair, the last representing the British Foreign Office. As\r\nthey approached the lines one shell from a four-inch gun burst within\r\ntwenty-five yards of them, while others exploded only thirty or forty\r\nyards away. This incident seemed greatly to amuse the soldiers in the\r\ntrenches, who laughed heartily at the embarrassment of the civilians.\r\n\r\nThe visitors were invited by the soldiers into their shelters, which\r\nare dry caves with narrow entrances and with clay floors covered with\r\nmatting or sacking and faintly illuminated by the light which filters\r\nin from the entrance or by bits of candle on the inside. Men who had\r\nbeen on duty throughout the night were sleeping in these caves.\r\n\r\nThe men on the firing line express the utmost confidence that what was\r\ndone yesterday and this morning they can keep on doing until the war\r\nhas been won. They never hear the vague, unverified reports circulated\r\nin Paris, sometimes of tremendous and impossible victories, sometimes\r\nsinister hints of disaster. They know what they have done since March\r\n9, when they were ordered to act on this part of the Aisne. They talk\r\nas a matter of course of another winter campaign, because, they say,\r\nit will take another year to break the German power.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS' GRASS-GROWN STREETS\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch of July 9 from Arras via Paris reads:_\r\n\r\nShells have been dropping into Arras at intervals today, as they have\r\nbeen for 250 days. Each twenty-four hours a few more buildings crumple\r\nor burn, although the Fire Department still is efficient in\r\nextinguishing flames.\r\n\r\nOne thousand civilians out of a former population of 35,000 are still\r\nhere. There were 4,000 in December when The Associated Press\r\ncorrespondent first visited the town. A few scores of the inhabitants\r\nhave been killed or wounded, while the others have been persuaded by\r\nthe military authorities to go away. None of those remaining thinks of\r\nsleeping anywhere except in a cellar. The rest of their time they\r\nspend out of doors, when no shells are falling.\r\n\r\nThe streets, which formerly were filled with traffic, are now\r\ngrass-grown. Two postmen deliver the mail, which comes regularly once\r\na day by military post. Several shops located underground are open for\r\nbusiness. Displayed on cellar doors are baskets of fresh vegetables,\r\nwhich can be bought at about the same prices as in Paris. Inside the\r\nprincipal grocery are many standard brands of American, French, and\r\nBritish canned goods.\r\n\r\nAbout half the outer walls of the beautiful City Hall are still\r\nstanding, but there remains only one jagged corner of the imposing\r\nbelfry which once adorned the great square of Arras. A citizen\r\noccupying a cellar on the other side of the square counted the shells\r\nwhich struck the belfry, and says it took 360 to shatter the beautiful\r\nbit of architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRAS CATHEDRAL\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch from Paris dated July 13 reports:_\r\n\r\nSince June 27 the Germans have systematically bombarded various parts\r\nof Arras with projectiles of all calibres, says an official\r\ncommunication given out today by the French War Department.\r\n\r\nOn June 27 the bombardment was extremely violent and was executed by\r\nsix-inch, eight-inch and seventeen-inch guns, between the hours of 8\r\nA.M. and 2 P.M., and between 6 P.M. and 7:30 P.M. The fire was\r\ndirected particularly at the citadel and neighboring streets.\r\n\r\nOn July 3, toward 6:30 o'clock in the evening, a further bombardment\r\ntook place in which incendiary shells were used, and they started a\r\nmost violent fire.\r\n\r\nOn July 5 at 4:30 P.M., the statement continues, the enemy recommenced\r\nits bombardment of the city, concentrating its fire upon the environs\r\nof the cathedral, more especially upon St. Vaast, the ancient Bishop's\r\npalace, which had been transformed into a museum. Incendiary shells\r\nset the building on fire, and the use of fuse shells from three-inch\r\nand four-inch guns prevented our organizing to combat the fire, which\r\nsoon assumed great proportions and completely destroyed the palace.\r\nDuring the night there was an intermittent bombardment.\r\n\r\nOn July 6, about 7 A.M., shells fell on the Cathedral, the roof of\r\nwhich took fire, and, despite the efforts of our troops, was entirely\r\nconsumed, as were the Cathedral organs.\r\n\r\nThe departmental archives, which had been deposited in the Palace of\r\nSt. Vaast, had been placed in the cellar of the palace before the\r\nbombardment and were saved. The sacred ornaments and part of the\r\nfurnishings in the Cathedral were removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE FECHT VALLEY\r\n\r\n_The French official \"Eyewitness\" reported on July 15 the French\r\nvictory in the battle of Metzeral in upper Alsace, as follows:_\r\n\r\nThe operations by which our troops captured the towns of Metzeral and\r\nSondernach, which are situated in the Fecht Valley, have been\r\nremarkable because of the means employed and the results obtained, and\r\nas the Alpine troops have been forced to surmount all possible\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n_Metzeral, the eyewitness explains, is situated in a valley surrounded\r\nby high hills, the sides of which dropped precipitously down to the\r\nFecht region. On these hills was stationed artillery, to the rear of\r\nwhich, within easy access, large reinforcements could be massed and\r\nbrought to the front when needed. He continued:_\r\n\r\nFrom prisoners we learned that the Germans considered their position\r\nimpregnable. It was surrounded by several lines of trenches and barbed\r\nwire entanglements. We made long preparations for the attack,\r\nconcentrating troops and bringing supplies up the Vosges through\r\nwinding, narrow, and hastily constructed roads, twenty miles in\r\nlength. New trenches were dug, mines laid, and various other details\r\nattended to.\r\n\r\nOn June 15, after prolonged and heavy artillery fire on both sides of\r\nthe valley, the attack was begun against Hill 830, on which we\r\ncaptured trenches situated on the slopes, taking two companies\r\nprisoners. A portion of the trenches on Braunkopf also fell into our\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nAt Eichwald we gained less, as here the German fortifications were\r\nstrongest. At Anlass, also, although many grenades were thrown, the\r\nfortifications were of such a character as to make it impossible to\r\nbreak through.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the attack was resumed, with the purpose of\r\ngaining us all the positions on Braunkopf and Hill 830. We began at\r\nthis point to encircle Eichwald, as the road to Metzeral now lay open.\r\nThe Germans remained at Anlass, where our attack always stopped, and\r\nwith their fire across the valley on Braunkopf made it impossible for\r\nus to proceed.\r\n\r\nAll our efforts were now concentrated on Anlass. We attacked on June\r\n18 and 19, and on the 20th the German positions fell into our hands.\r\nOur troops continued on down the valley, capturing 6 officers, 11\r\nnon-commissioned officers, and 140 men.\r\n\r\nAn attack directed at the same time against Winterhagel, situated to\r\nthe south of Anlass, was marked by a sad incident. A small group of\r\nchasseurs who succeeded in breaking through the barbed-wire\r\nentanglements found themselves under a crossfire of quick-firers. The\r\nmen tried to construct a shelter with the tools they carried. The\r\nGermans cried \"Surrender!\" Not one man answered. The quick-firers\r\naccomplished their work, and the men were found lying with faces to\r\nthe ground, as if they had dropped when drawn up in line for parade.\r\n\r\nOur attacks were now centred on Metzeral. The factory at Steinbruck\r\nwas taken on the night of June 17, and a battalion entered Altenkof\r\nthe day following. On June 21 our men came down from Braunkopf,\r\nsurrounded the village on the north, and took the railway station. The\r\nGermans in Metzeral, threatened with capture, placed quick-firers in\r\nseveral houses to protect their retreat and prepared to set the place\r\non fire. Our artillery quickly demolished the houses in which German\r\nartillery had been placed, and our troops entered the flaming streets\r\nfrom the north and west. The village was burned.\r\n\r\nOn the two following nights, while our troops harassed the retreating\r\nenemy, Winterhagel and Sondernach fell into our hands and our line was\r\nestablished along the length of the valley of the Fecht as far as\r\nSondernach.\r\n\r\nThe action resulted in the capture of 20 officers, 53 non-commissioned\r\nofficers, and 638 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince in the Argonne\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch from Paris stated on June 30 that the\r\nGerman attempt to divert the attention of the French from the latter's\r\noffensive in the region north of Arras has been productive of gains in\r\nthe Argonne, where a three-days' bombardment of the French trenches\r\nwas followed by the capture of French positions near Bagatelle.\r\nElsewhere, particularly on the Yser, to the north of Arras, north of\r\nVerdun and near Metzeral in Alsace, there have been artillery\r\nexchanges without notable results._\r\n\r\n_The dispatch recorded the following French official communication,\r\nissued June 30:_\r\n\r\nIn the Argonne, after a bombardment lasting three days, the Germans\r\nattacked our positions on the road between Binarville and Le Four de\r\nParis, but were twice repulsed. They succeeded only in their third\r\nattack in gaining a foothold in some parts of our lines near\r\nBagatelle, and they were everywhere else thrown back after a violent\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nThere has been a bombardment on the front north of Verdun, in the Bois\r\nd'Ailly, as well as in the region of Metzeral.\r\n\r\n_On July 4 Berlin's official report said:_\r\n\r\nIn the Argonne the Germans continue their offensive. Our booty has\r\nincreased considerably, and amounted on July 1 and 2 to 2,556\r\nprisoners--among them 37 officers--25 machine guns, 72 mine throwers,\r\nand one revolver gun.\r\n\r\n_It was reported from London on July 14 that the attack of the German\r\nCrown Prince's army in the Argonne, having for its objective the\r\ninvestment of the French forts of the Verdun area, had resulted in an\r\nadvance of two-thirds of a mile and the capture of 2,581 prisoners and\r\nseveral pieces of artillery, according to German official reports. A\r\ncommunique issued in Paris, while admitting the German success,\r\nasserts that nowhere did the assailants gain more than a quarter of a\r\nmile and announces that the Crown Prince's offensive had been\r\ndefinitely checked._\r\n\r\n_Following is the text of the German official statement of July 14:_\r\n\r\nIn the Argonne a German attack resulted in complete success northeast\r\nof Vienne-le-Chateau. Our troops took by storm the enemy positions in\r\nthe hills extending over a width of three kilometers (about a mile and\r\nthree-quarters) and a depth of one kilometer. Hill No. 285, La Fille\r\nMorte, is in our possession. Two thousand five hundred and eighty-one\r\nuninjured prisoners, including fifty-one officers, fell into our\r\nhands. In addition, 300 wounded were taken under our care. Two field\r\ncannon, two revolver cannon, six machine guns, and a large quantity of\r\ntools were captured. Our troops advanced as far as the positions of\r\nthe French artillery and rendered eight cannon useless. These are now\r\nstanding between the French and German lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scene of the German Crown Prince's drive in the\r\nArgonne.]\r\n\r\n_The official statement issued at Berlin on July 15 says:_\r\n\r\nThe French made repeated attempts yesterday, which lasted into the\r\nnight, to recapture the positions we took from them in the Forest of\r\nArgonne. Notwithstanding the employment of large quantities of\r\nammunition and of strong forces recently brought up, all their attacks\r\nbroke down. In many places there was bitter fighting with hand\r\ngrenades and encounters at close quarters.\r\n\r\nThe enemy paid for his unsuccessful efforts with extraordinarily heavy\r\nlosses. The number of French prisoners has been increased to 68\r\nofficers and 3,688 men.\r\n\r\nThe success of our troops was all the more remarkable as, according to\r\ncorresponding statements made by prisoners, the French had prepared\r\nfor a great attack against our positions on the Argonne front on July\r\n14, their national festival day.\r\n\r\n_The text of the German official statement published July 16 is as\r\nfollows:_\r\n\r\nFrench attacks delivered yesterday and the day before to the west of\r\nthe Argonne Forest failed in the face of the North German Landwehr,\r\nwho inflicted large and sanguinary losses on the enemy in bitter\r\nhand-to-hand fighting. We captured 462 prisoners.\r\n\r\nSince June 20 our troops have fought continually in the Argonne and to\r\nthe west of that forest, with the exception of short interruptions. In\r\naddition to the gain in territory and booty in materials a total of\r\n116 officers and 7,009 French prisoners has been reached up to the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nOn our front which joins the Argonne to the east, lively artillery\r\nbattles are in progress. Attacks made by the enemy in this region were\r\nrepulsed without difficulty.\r\n\r\n_In a dispatch from Berlin, dated July 16, by Wireless to Sayville,\r\nN.Y., it is reported that in the news items given out by the Overseas\r\nNews Agency was the following:_\r\n\r\nGerman military tacticians point out that the German victory in the\r\nForest of Argonne, in France, is of special importance, as it shows\r\nthat the connections toward Western France are gradually being cut.\r\n\r\nThe large amount of war materials captured by the Germans in the last\r\nbattle illustrates the importance attributed to the positions by the\r\nFrench commanders. The French, however, were unable to resist the\r\nterrific offensive of the Crown Prince's army.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGallipoli's Shambles\r\n\r\nAllied Operations Around the Turks' Fortress of Achi Baba\r\n\r\n     The subjoined narratives, official and semi-official, show\r\n     clearly the formidable nature of the Allies' land\r\n     undertaking in the attempt to force the passage of the\r\n     Dardanelles. It will be noted that Compton Mackenzie, the\r\n     novelist, has temporarily replaced E. Ashmead-Bartlett as\r\n     the British press \"eyewitness\" on the peninsula, and that\r\n     General Sir Ian Hamilton's reports have for the first time\r\n     begun to appear. A notable sketch of his career appears in\r\n     the Atlantic Monthly for July by the pen of Alfred G.\r\n     Gardiner. A poet and a man of romantic ancestry and taste,\r\n     experienced in commands in India, in Egypt, and in South\r\n     Africa, General Hamilton was called by the late Lord Roberts\r\n     the ablest commander in the field. For his qualities of\r\n     daring and inspiration, as well as for his coolness in\r\n     directing the complex movements of the battlefield, he was\r\n     chosen for this most dangerous and bloody of enterprises\r\n     against the German-officered Turks.[4]\r\n\r\n     Mr. Mackenzie estimates the losses of the Turks up to June\r\n     30 at not less than 70,000. Prime Minister Asquith in the\r\n     House of Commons, on July 1, announced that the British\r\n     naval and military losses up to May 31 aggregated 38,635\r\n     officers and men. Yet the great fortress of Achi Baba, by\r\n     that time one of the most powerful in the world, was untaken\r\n     up to July 20, and the French and British Allies held but a\r\n     small corner of the area to be conquered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: His first report, covering the actions from March 13,\r\nwhen he left London, to May 20, is here omitted because other official\r\nreports covering the same period were printed in the June and July\r\nnumbers of CURRENT HISTORY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF THE LONGEST DAY\r\n\r\nBy Compton Mackenzie\r\n\r\nAuthorized Press Representative at the Dardanelles.\r\n\r\nDardanelles, via Alexandria,\r\nJune 30, 1915.\r\n\r\nThe battle of the Fourth of June ended with substantial progress on\r\nour centre, although on our left and on our right, notwithstanding the\r\nmost violent charges and counter-charges, we were unable to\r\nconsolidate some of our initial gains. The reason of this may be found\r\nin the natural strongholds of the Turkish flanks, natural strongholds\r\nthat are helped by the most elaborate fortifications.\r\n\r\nThe British and French line from the Aegean to the Dardanelles is\r\nconfronted by rising ground that culminates in the centre with the\r\nflat summit of Achi Baba, 800 ft. high. On either side the ground\r\nfalls away to the sea in ravines and dry watercourses (_deres_), which\r\nthe Turks have had time to make impregnable to any except those superb\r\ntroops that are now fighting to pass over them.\r\n\r\nThere is no room upon the Gallipoli Peninsula to find weak points, and\r\nwe are now in the position of having to storm an immensely strong\r\nfortress, the advanced works of which, by an amazing feat of arms, we\r\nalready hold, and the glacis of which has to be crossed before we move\r\nforward to the assault upon the bastion of Achi Baba and beyond to the\r\nfinal assault upon the very walls of that fortress, the Kilid Bahr\r\nPlateau.\r\n\r\nFarther up the coast the Australians and New Zealanders have made a\r\nlodgment upon one of the strongest advanced works of the Kilid Bahr\r\nPlateau. As seen from the northwest here they threaten the\r\ncommunications of the \"fortress\" and are drawing against them a large\r\npart of the garrison. This is composed of the flower of the Turkish\r\nArmy, and, notwithstanding casualties that must already amount to\r\n70,000, the troops are fighting with gallantry--with desperation,\r\nindeed, because they realize that when the bastion of Achi Baba falls\r\nthe occupation of the Kilid Bahr Plateau becomes a mere question of\r\ntime, and that when Kilid Bahr falls the doom of Constantinople is at\r\nhand. In view of the difficulties--were it not for the landing one\r\nwould be tempted to say the impossibilities--which confront our men,\r\nthe gain of a score of yards in the Gallipoli Peninsula may fairly\r\nrepresent for the purposes of comparison a gain of 500 yards in the\r\nWestern theatre of war. Therefore, to find its importance the gain of\r\n500 yards on June 4 must be measured with affairs like Neuve Chapelle;\r\nand the few quiet days that succeeded may be accepted as repose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Gallipoli Peninsula, showing the mountainous\r\nnature of the terrain, and Achi Baba.]\r\n\r\nAfter a violent effort on the night of June 11 to 12 there was a\r\nbrilliant little action by the Border Regiment and the South Wales\r\nBorderers which resulted in the gain of two trenches. On the 16th the\r\nenemy, led by a Turkish and a German officer, made an assault on the\r\ntrenches of the 88th Brigade, but were driven off with loss. However,\r\nthat night the trenches gained by the two regiments on the 11th were\r\nheavily bombed, so heavily that our men were forced to retire about 30\r\nyards and dig themselves in. At dawn we were able to enfilade with\r\nmachine-guns the vacated trenches.\r\n\r\nThen the Dublin Fusiliers charged with the bayonet, and once more gave\r\nus possession of our gains at heavy cost to the Turks, whose dead\r\nfilled one trench.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 18th the enemy bombarded very heavily another\r\nportion of our trenches on this side of the line. They were evidently\r\nattempting in miniature our own methods of Neuve Chapelle and June 4,\r\nas immediately after the bombardment they were seen to be massing for\r\nan attack. However, the imitation ended rather abruptly at this point,\r\nand the affair petered out.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 19th the Turks by a fierce attack, managed to\r\nget into an awkward salient which had remained in our hands after June\r\n4. For some time there was great difficulty in recovering this, but\r\nthe 5th Royal Scots and a company of the Worcesters, led by\r\nLieut.-Colonel Wilson of the former regiment, made a glorious attack,\r\nand drove out the Turks.\r\n\r\nOf the Royal Scots, one can add nothing but that they are Edinburgh\r\nTerritorials brought in by the fortune of war to make the twelfth\r\nregiment of the immortal 29th Division whose deeds since April 25\r\nmight have stirred the ghost of Homer to sing their valour.\r\n\r\nMention has been made already of the difficulties that oppose our\r\nadvance upon the two flanks. On June 21 it was determined to\r\nstraighten the line upon the extreme right, and at 1.30 A.M. the\r\npreliminary bombardment began. The dawn had been clear, but soon a\r\ncurtain of silver, through which gleamed the ghost of the rising sun,\r\nhung over the Kereves Dere. This was the smoke of bursting shells.\r\nSlowly as the sun climbed up the curtain became more substantial. Then\r\nit seemed to droop and sweep along the hollows like a vanishing mist\r\nof dawn, and during a respite the thin blue smoke of the bivouac fires\r\ncame tranquilly up into the still air. The respite was very brief, and\r\nthe bombardment began again with greater fierceness than before. The\r\n75's drummed unceasingly. The reverberation of the 125's and of the\r\nhowitzers shook the observation post. Over the Kereves Dere, and\r\nbeyond, upon the sloping shoulders of Achi Baba, the curtain became a\r\npall. The sun climbed higher and higher. All that first mirage of\r\nbeauty had disappeared, and there was nothing but the monstrous shapes\r\nof bursting shells, giants of smoke that appeared one after another\r\nalong the Turkish lines. All through the morning the cannonade went\r\non.\r\n\r\nBy noon the Second Division of the French had on the left stormed and\r\ncaptured all the Turkish trenches of the first two lines. Even the\r\nHaricot Redoubt, with its damnable entanglements and its maze of\r\ncommunicating trenches, was in French hands. On the right, however,\r\nthe First Division, after reaching their objective, had been\r\ncounter-attacked so effectively that they had fallen back. Again they\r\nadvanced; again they took the trenches; again they were driven out. It\r\nbegan to look as if the victory upon the left would be fruitless, that\r\nthe position would become an untenable salient and the Haricot Redoubt\r\nrevert to the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt this moment a message was sent to say that the trenches must be\r\nrecaptured, and, when recaptured, held. There were still five hours of\r\ndaylight for this battle of the longest day. British guns and\r\nhowitzers were asked for and were lent at once. The bombardment was\r\nresumed throughout that afternoon, and at half-past five it seemed as\r\nif every gun on earth were pouring shells on the Turkish lines.\r\n\r\nAt six o'clock the third assault was delivered. In one trench there\r\nwas a temporary shortage of ammunition, but the enemy fought even with\r\nstones and sticks and fists. A battalion came hurrying up from the\r\nTurkish right to reinforce it, was caught on open ground by the\r\ndrumming 75's, and it melted away. Six hundred yards of Turkish\r\ntrenches were taken, and still the bombardment was continued in order\r\nto ward off the counter-attack that was anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe smoke of the shells, which at dawn had been ethereal, almost\r\ntranslucent, was now, in the sunset, turbid and sinister, yet the\r\nsunset was very splendid, flaming in crimson streamers over Imbros,\r\ntinting the east with rosy reflections and turning the peaks of Asia\r\nto sapphires. It had a peculiar significance on this longest day of\r\nthe year, crowning as it did those precious five hours of daylight\r\nthat, for the French, had been fraught with such achievement. Slowly\r\nthe colour faded out, and now, minute by minute, the flashes of the\r\nguns became more distinct; the smoke was merged in the gathering dusk,\r\nand away over the more distant Turkish lines the bursts of shrapnel\r\ncame out like stars against the brief twilight. One knew the anxiety\r\nthere would be in the darkness that now was falling upon this 21st of\r\nJune, but in the morning we heard gladly that the enemy's\r\ncounter-attacks had failed, and that our Allies were indeed firmly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish casualties were at least 7,000. One trench, 200 yards long\r\nand 10 feet deep, was brimming over with the dead. They were valiant\r\nthose dead men. French officers who have fought in the West say that,\r\nas a fighting unit, one Turk is worth two Germans; in fact, with his\r\nback to the wall, the Turk is magnificent. The French casualties were\r\nmarvellously few considering what a day it had been, what an enemy was\r\nbeing attacked, and how much had been gained.\r\n\r\nThe right of the line now commands Kereves Dere, and the profile of\r\nAchi Baba seems to write itself less solidly against the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACK BY LAND AND SEA\r\n\r\n_The British Press Bureau on June 30, 1915, issued the following:_\r\n\r\nGeneral Sir Ian Hamilton reports that the plan of operations on the\r\n28th was to throw forward the left of his line southeast of Krithia,\r\npivoting on a point about one mile from the sea, and after advancing\r\non the extreme left for about half a mile to establish a new line\r\nfacing east on ground thus gained. This plan entailed the capture in\r\nsuccession of two lines of the Turkish trenches east of the Saghir\r\nDere, and five lines of trenches west of it. The Australian Corps was\r\nordered to co-operate by making a vigorous demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe action opened at nine o'clock with a bombardment by heavy\r\nartillery. The assistance rendered by the French in this bombardment\r\nwas most valuable.\r\n\r\nAt 10.20 the Field Artillery opened fire to cut wire in front of\r\nTurkish trenches, and this was effectively done. The effect on the\r\nenemy's trench near the sea was great. The very accurate fire of his\r\nMajesty's ships Talbot, Scorpion and Wolverine succeeded in keeping\r\ndown his artillery fire from that quarter.\r\n\r\nAt 10.45 a small Turkish advanced work in the Saghir Dere known as the\r\nBoomerang Redoubt was assaulted. This little fort, which was very\r\nstrongly sited and protected by extra strong wire entanglements, has\r\nlong been a source of trouble. After special bombardment by trench\r\nmortar, and while bombardment of surrounding trenches was at its\r\nheight, part of the Border Regiment at the exact moment prescribed\r\nleapt from their trenches as one man like a pack of hounds, and\r\npouring out of cover raced across, and took the work most brilliantly.\r\n\r\nThe artillery bombardment increased in intensity till 11 A.M., when\r\nthe range was lengthened, and infantry advanced. The infantry attack\r\nwas carried out with great dash along the whole line.\r\n\r\nWest of Saghir Dere three lines of trenches were captured with little\r\nopposition. The trenches were full of dead Turks, many buried by the\r\nbombardment, and one hundred prisoners were taken in them.\r\n\r\nEast of the Ravine the Royal Scots made a fine attack, capturing the\r\ntwo lines of trenches assigned to their objective, but the remainder\r\nof the Brigade on their right met with severe opposition and were\r\nunable to get forward.\r\n\r\nAt 11.30 the Royal Fusiliers led its Brigade in the second phase of\r\nthe attack west of the Ravine. The Brigade advanced with great\r\nsteadiness and resolution through the trenches already captured, and\r\non across the open, and taking two more lines of trenches reached the\r\nobjective allotted to them, the Lancashire Fusiliers inclining\r\nhalf-right and forming line to connect with our new position east of\r\nthe Ravine.\r\n\r\nThe northernmost objective had now been attained, but the Gurkhas\r\npressing on under the cliffs captured an important knoll still further\r\nforward, actually due west of Krithia. This they fortified and held\r\nduring the night, making our total gain on the left precisely one\r\nthousand yards.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon the trenches, a small portion of which remained\r\nuncaptured on the right, were attacked, but the enemy held on\r\nstubbornly supported by machine-guns and artillery, and the attacks\r\ndid not succeed.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the enemy counter-attacked the furthest trenches\r\ngained, but was repulsed with heavy loss. A party of Turks, who\r\npenetrated from the flank between two lines of captured trenches, was\r\nsubjected to machine-gun fire at daybreak, suffered very heavily, and\r\nthe survivors surrendered.\r\n\r\nExcept for a small portion of trench already mentioned, which is still\r\nheld by the enemy, all and more than was hoped for from operations has\r\nbeen gained. On the extreme left the line has been pushed forward to a\r\nspecially strong point well beyond the limit of the advance originally\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\nAll engaged did well, but certainly the chief factor in the success\r\nwas the splendid attack carried out by the 29th Division, whose\r\nconduct on this, as on previous occasions, was beyond praise.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIANS IN ACTION\r\n\r\n_The British Press Bureau states on July 1 that, in continuation of\r\nhis last message respecting the British advance in the Gallipoli\r\nPeninsula, Sir Ian Hamilton had reported as follows:_\r\n\r\nFurther details have now been received with regard to the part played\r\nby the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps in the operations of the\r\n29th. As previously stated, the General Officer Commanding the\r\nAustralian and New Zealand Army Corps was instructed to undertake\r\noperations with a view to preventing the enemy in his front from\r\ndetaching troops to the southern area.\r\n\r\nBetween 11.30 A.M. and 12 noon the action was opened, His Majesty's\r\nships Humber, Pincher, and Chelmer engaging enemy's heavy guns. At 1\r\nP.M. part of the Second Light Horse Brigade and the Third Infantry\r\nBrigade moved out on the right of the position, advancing some 700\r\nyards, when the enemy was encountered in strength. Meanwhile the\r\nartillery engaged the enemy's reserves, which were collecting in the\r\nravine opposite right centre, by shelling them effectively with guns\r\nand howitzers.\r\n\r\nAbout 2.30 P.M. the enemy appeared to be preparing a counter-attack\r\nagainst the left of our advanced troops, but on howitzer and\r\nmachine-gun fire being turned on the enemy's attacks were easily\r\nrepulsed. The retirement of the advanced troops was begun at 3 P.M.,\r\nwell covered by rifle, machine-gun, and artillery fire, and the troops\r\nwere all back in the trenches between 4.30 and 5.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nOur machine-guns and artillery did considerable execution. Naval gun\r\nfire also gave valuable assistance. Demonstrations made after dark at\r\n8.45 and 11.30 P.M. with flares, star shell, and destroyer bombardment\r\nwere successfully carried out.\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Corps report 180 prisoners taken since the morning of the\r\n28th, namely, 38 of the Sixteenth Regiment, 139 of the Thirty-third\r\nRegiment, and three of the Thirteenth Regiment. A Circassian prisoner\r\ncarried a wounded private of Royal Scots into our lines under fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACKED BY THE TURKS\r\n\r\n_Sir Ian Hamilton reported, as published by the British Press Bureau\r\non July 6, the following details of the attack made by the Turks on\r\nthe night of 29th-30th June:_\r\n\r\nAbout 2 A.M. searchlights of His Majesty's ship Scorpion discovered\r\nhalf a Turkish battalion advancing near the sea northwest of Krithia.\r\nScorpion opened fire, and few of the enemy got away. Simultaneously\r\nthe enemy attacked the knoll we captured due west of Krithia,\r\nadvancing from a nullah in close formation in several lines. The\r\nattack came under artillery and enfilade rifle fire, and the enemy\r\nlost heavily. The foremost Turks got within forty yards of the\r\nparapet, but only a few returned.\r\n\r\nThe Turks made several heavy bomb attacks during the night, our troops\r\nbeing twice driven back a short distance. Early in the morning we\r\nregained these trenches by bayonet attack, and they have since been\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\nAt 5.30 A.M. 2,000 Turks, moving from Krithia into the ravine, were\r\nscattered by machine-gun fire. The operations reflect great credit on\r\nthe vigilance and accurate shooting of His Majesty's ship Scorpion.\r\nThe Turkish losses in the nullah and ravine are estimated at 1,500 to\r\n2,000 dead.\r\n\r\nAbout 10 P.M. on the 30th of June the Turks again attacked with bombs\r\na portion of the most northerly trench captured by us on 28th. An\r\nofficer of the Gurkhas being wounded, not dangerously as it turned\r\nout, the men became infuriated, flung all their bombs at the enemy,\r\nand then charging down out of the trench used their kukris for the\r\nfirst time and with excellent effect. About dawn the Turks once more\r\nattempted an attack over the open, but nearly the whole of these\r\nattacking forces, about half a battalion, were shot down, and a final\r\nbomb attack, though commenced, failed utterly.\r\n\r\nFurther reports from Australia and New Zealand Corps, as to the\r\nenemy's attack on 29th-30th on our right flank, state that the action\r\ncommenced by very heavy fire from midnight till 1.30 A.M., to which\r\nour men only replied by a series of cheers. The Turks then launched\r\ntheir attack, and came right on with bayonet and bombs. Those who\r\nsucceeded in getting into our saps were instantly killed; the\r\nremainder were dealt with by bomb and rifle fire from the 7th and 8th\r\nLight Horse. By 2 A.M. the enemy broke, and many were killed while\r\nwithdrawing. The enemy's attack was strongest on his right. They were\r\ncompletely taken aback by a concealed sap constructed well ahead of\r\nour main line, and the dead are lying thickly in front of this. Some\r\ngot into the sap and several across it; all these were wiped out by\r\nfire from the main parapet farther back.\r\n\r\nFollowing the defeat of this attack, the enemy attacked at 3 A.M. on\r\nour left, and 30 men came over the parapets in front of the right of\r\nQuinn's Post. These were duly polished off. Prisoners brought in state\r\nthat three fresh battalions were employed in the main attack, which\r\nwas made by the personal order of Enver Pasha, who, as they definitely\r\nassert, was present in the trenches on June 29. This is confirmed by\r\nthe statement of an intelligent Armenian prisoner captured on that\r\ndate. According to him, stringent orders were recently issued that no\r\nfurther attacks were to be made, because if the Turks remained on the\r\ndefensive the British would be forced to attack, and would suffer as\r\nseverely as the Turks had hitherto suffered. But Enver Pasha, when he\r\narrived in the northern section, overrode this instruction, and orders\r\nwere received by the prisoner's regiment that the Australians were to\r\nbe driven into the sea.\r\n\r\nOn July 2, after a heavy bombardment of our advanced positions by high\r\nexplosives and shrapnel, lasting half an hour, the enemy infantry\r\nadvanced, but were driven back to the main nullah about a mile to our\r\nfront by the accurate shooting of His Majesty's ship Scorpion and by\r\nour rifle and machine-gun fire. About 7 P.M. the Turkish artillery\r\nrecommenced their bombardment, under cover of which two battalions\r\nemerged from the nullah to the northeast of our most advanced trench\r\nand commenced an attack across the open, advancing in two regular\r\nlines. At the outset very effective shrapnel fire from the 10th\r\nBattery Royal Field Artillery caused great execution among the\r\nattackers. Gurkha supports then advanced, and there being insufficient\r\nroom in trenches took up a position on some excavated earth in rear,\r\nwhence deadly rifle fire was poured into the advancing lines. Turkish\r\nofficers could be seen endeavouring to get their men forward, but they\r\nwould not face the fire and retreated in disorder after suffering\r\nheavy casualties.\r\n\r\nThe ground in front of our trenches in every direction can be seen\r\ncovered with Turkish dead, and patrols sent out at night report that\r\nthe valleys and ravine are also full of them. There can be no possible\r\ndoubt that the enemy's losses have been very heavy. After checking and\r\ncounter-checking reports from all sources, I put down their total\r\ncasualties between June 28 and July 2 at 5,150 killed and 15,000\r\nwounded. The number of killed is, therefore, approximately correct,\r\nwhile the wounded is an estimate based partly on the knowledge of the\r\nnumber already reported arrived at Constantinople, and on experience\r\nof proportion of wounded to killed in previous engagements. Since June\r\n29 the total amount of Turkish arms and ammunition collected is 516\r\nrifles, 51 bayonets, 200 sets of equipment, 126,400 rounds of\r\nammunition, 100 bombs.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from captured divisional orders: \"There is\r\nnothing that causes us more sorrow, increases the courage of the\r\nenemy, and encourages him to attack more freely, causing us great\r\nlosses, than the losing of these trenches. Henceforth commanders who\r\nsurrender these trenches, from whatever side the attack may come,\r\nbefore the last man is killed will be punished in the same way as if\r\nthey had run away. Especially will the commanders of units told off to\r\nguard a certain front be punished if, instead of thinking about their\r\nwork, supporting their units and giving information to the higher\r\ncommand, they only take action after a regrettable incident has taken\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that this will not occur again. I give notice that if it does\r\nI shall carry out the punishment. I do not desire to see a blot made\r\non the courage of our men by those who escape from the trenches to\r\navoid the rifle and machine-gun fire of the enemy. Henceforth I shall\r\nhold responsible all officers who do not shoot with their revolvers\r\nall the privates who try to escape from the trenches on any pretext.\r\nCommander of the 11th Div., Colonel Rifaat.\"\r\n\r\nTo the copy from which this extract was taken the following note is\r\nappended: \"To Commander of the 1st Battalion. The contents will be\r\ncommunicated to the officers, and I promise to carry out the orders\r\ntill the last drop of our blood has been shed. Sign and return.\r\nSigned. Hassan, Commander, 127th Regiment. Then follow signatures\r\ncompany commanders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAVY TURKISH LOSSES\r\n\r\n_The British Press Bureau on July 7 issued this report by General Ian\r\nHamilton:_\r\n\r\nThe night of July 3-4 was quiet in the northern section, but at 4 A.M.\r\nthe enemy started a heavy bombardment of the trenches. All the guns\r\npreviously used against us, and some new ones, were in action, but the\r\nbombardment died away about 6 A.M. without doing much damage. During\r\nthe bombardment about twenty 11.2-inch shells were dropped from a\r\nTurkish battleship in the strait.\r\n\r\nIn the southern section the Turks kept up a heavy musketry fire along\r\nthe whole line during the night and did not leave their trenches. At 4\r\nA.M. their batteries started the most violent bombardment that has yet\r\nbeen experienced. At least 5,000 rounds of artillery ammunition were\r\nexpended by them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile this shelling of our lines on the peninsula proved the\r\npreliminary to a general attack on our front with special efforts at\r\ncertain points. The principal effort was made at the junction of the\r\nRoyal Naval Division section with that of the French.\r\n\r\nHere, at 7.30 A.M., the Turks drove back our advanced troops and\r\nassaulted a portion of the line held by the Royal Naval Division. Some\r\nfifty Turks gained a footing in our trench, where, nevertheless, some\r\nmen of the Royal Naval Division held on to our supports, and the men\r\nwho had retired counter-attacked immediately and hurled the Turks out\r\nof the trench again.\r\n\r\nAnother attack on the right of the Twenty-ninth Division section, was\r\npractically wiped out by rifle and machine-gun fire. On our left the\r\nTurks massed in a nullah, to the northeast of our newly-captured\r\ntrenches, and attempted several attacks. None of these was able to get\r\nhome owing to the steadiness of our troops and our effective artillery\r\nsupport. The bombardment died down toward 11 A.M., though it was\r\nresumed at intervals.\r\n\r\nNot only was the result a complete failure, but while our losses were\r\nnegligible and no impression was made on our line, the enemy added a\r\nlarge number to his recent very heavy casualties. It seems plain from\r\nthe disjointed nature of his attack that he is finding it difficult to\r\ndrive his infantry forward to face our fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAUGHTER BY CANNON LIGHT\r\n\r\n_In a dispatch by George Renwick to The London Daily Chronicle, dated\r\nat Lemnos, July 11, the following description of fighting, followed by\r\nheavy Turco-German casualties, appeared:_\r\n\r\nThe heaviest fighting which has taken place on Gallipoli Peninsula\r\nsince the allied forces landed there began late on Tuesday and lasted\r\nwell into Wednesday. It resulted in a swing forward of the southern\r\nline of the allied armies for five furlongs and in the infliction of\r\nstaggering losses on the enemy. Those who were in the battle place the\r\nTurco-German casualties at 7,000 killed and from 14,000 to 15,000\r\nwounded. Many prisoners were taken.\r\n\r\nThe whole army in the southern part of the peninsula was engaged, and\r\nthe Australians and New Zealanders further north also played a part.\r\nThe victory marks a definite stage in the initial work of throwing\r\nforces around Achi Baba, which may now be described as one of the\r\nstrongest fortresses in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Allies had been resting in comparative tranquillity and the Turks\r\nhad evidently become persuaded the enemy was experiencing a shortage\r\nof ammunition. This belief convinced them of the excellent opportunity\r\nof driving the invaders into the sea. Late Tuesday night the first\r\nsigns of the enemy's movement were detected. No time was lost in\r\nflashing a warning message to headquarters. The French were soon alert\r\nand the artillery at that portion of the line against which the attack\r\nwas being prepared was quickly and strongly reinforced.\r\n\r\nFrench and British machine guns were rushed to the front until a\r\nperfect wall of heavy and light guns was in position. Then there came\r\na short interval of silence and waiting, almost oppressive. Suddenly\r\nthe stillness was broken by a tremendous burst of shells from the\r\nTurkish guns, and for a time shrapnel poured down on the French front.\r\nBut the men were safely positioned in dugouts and little loss\r\nresulted. From the strait loud booming began. The battered Goeben was\r\nat work again, and during the bombardment she pounded our right with\r\nsome forty 11-inch shells. Many did not burst--they were apparently of\r\nTurkish manufacture.\r\n\r\nThis hail of shells lasted just an hour and a half and was the\r\nseverest bombardment to which our lines have been subjected during the\r\nweeks of struggle on the peninsula. No sooner had the heavy fire\r\nceased than great solid masses of Turks leaped forward to the attack.\r\nOn they came, the silence unbroken save for their shouts, until they\r\nreached a point within sixty or seventy yards of the French position.\r\nThen from 200 well placed machine guns a devastating answering fire\r\nburst from our Allies' trenches, and the rifles joined in, 20,000 of\r\nthem. The big guns flared and cast a lurid light over the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nItaly's War on Austria\r\n\r\nSecond Month Closes with Offensive Operations in Swing Against Gorizia\r\n\r\n     On July 23, after two months of her war against Austria, an\r\n     appraisement may be taken of Italy's extensive and\r\n     business-like preparation for the conflict. Rapidly the\r\n     passes leading to the Trentino, Carinthia, Friuli, and the\r\n     valley of the Isonzo were secured, almost over night; and\r\n     then, with the regularity of a railway time-table, the\r\n     Italians began their hard, patient work, in hitherto\r\n     impassable regions, of neutralizing the Trentino, so as to\r\n     make impossible an invasion from that territory, and of\r\n     linking up their columns along the Isonzo, so that now, at\r\n     the beginning of August, a battle-front of seventy-five\r\n     miles extending from Tarvis to the Adriatic, is ready to\r\n     move eastward in the direction of Klagenfurt, beyond which\r\n     there are no Austrian fortifications until Vienna is\r\n     reached, 170 miles away--about as far as Cape Cod is from\r\n     New York City. The right flank of this battle-front has been\r\n     developed along the Carso plateau so as to neutralize, as\r\n     the Trentino was neutralized, the Peninsula of Istria with\r\n     the great commercial port of Trieste, the naval base of\r\n     Pola, and the Hungarian Free City of Fiume.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Italian field of activity saw during the week ended July 24 the\r\nblazing out of the Italian offensive. Italy apparently was then\r\nsatisfied that all the passages by means of which Austria could pour\r\ntroops to attack her rear are effectively stopped and has therefore\r\nbegun a determined advance along the Isonzo front from Tarvis to the\r\nAdriatic, with the object of breaking down completely Austria's first\r\ndefensive screen. The battle is, as is natural, centring around\r\nGorizia.\r\n\r\nOnce Gorizia falls, the Italian problem in so far as Trieste is\r\nconcerned, will be near solution. The Italians have made notable\r\nadvances in Cadore and along the Isonzo, on the plateau of Carso. But\r\nGorizia must be taken before a decided local victory can be recorded.\r\nThe fighting has not progressed as yet to the point where definite\r\ninformation is available, but in late July it seemed to have reached\r\nthe culminating stage. The surroundings of Gorizia, which is the key\r\nto the Isonzo district and the junction of five main roads and four\r\nmain railway lines, are protected with all manner of fortifications.\r\nThe official report from Rome on June 25 recorded the Italian\r\noccupation of Globna, north of Plava, and of the edge of the plateau\r\nbetween Sagrado and Monfalcone. From that date reports from Vienna\r\nrecorded continuous and heavy Italian attacks from the bridgehead at\r\nGoritz to the sea. The correspondent of the Berliner Tageblatt at the\r\nIsonzo front reported on July 7 that the second great Italian\r\noffensive had forced its way into the Austrian line at Podzora--a\r\nheight covering the bridgehead at Goritz--and at Vermegliano, between\r\nDoberdo and Monfalcone. A Geneva dispatch, dated July 14, reported the\r\ncapture by the Italians of two miles of trenches in the Carnic Alps,\r\nthe Alpine troops dragging their artillery to an altitude of 6,600\r\nfeet near Roskopel, and capturing to the south of Gorizia two\r\nimportant forts. On July 16 a dispatch from Rome told of a war council\r\nat the front held by King Victor Emmanuel and Premier Salandra, with\r\nCount Cadorna, Chief of the General Staff, and General Porro, his\r\nchief assistant. A Vienna official dispatch of that date reported\r\nincreased artillery activity in the coast district and in Carinthia.\r\nTwo passes at a height of over 10,000 feet were taken by the Italians\r\nat Venerodolol and Brizio, as reported July 17, and on July 18 they\r\nbegan an advance in Cadore, attacking a ring of powerful forts at a\r\ngreat height at Paneveggio, San Pelegrino, Monet, Livinallongo, and\r\nTresassi, while Goritz was shelled from land and air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Austro-Italian frontier, the scene of the\r\nfighting.]\r\n\r\nThen began, on July 20, a great general Italian assault on a 75-mile\r\nline from Tarvis to the Adriatic shore. A dispatch from Turin from the\r\ncorrespondent of The London Daily Chronicle announced a victorious\r\nadvance by the Italians on the Carso plateau, east of Sagrado, with\r\nthe capture of 2,000 Austrian prisoners. The War Office in Rome\r\nreported on July 21 that while the Italian defense continued to\r\ndevelop energetically in Cadore, and the artillery was effectively\r\nworking in Carnia, the struggle in the Isonzo zone continued with\r\nincreasing intensity. Toward Goritz the Italians gained part of the\r\nline of the heights which form the right bank of the river commanding\r\nthe town and the Isonzo bridges. On the Carso Plateau the Austrians\r\nwere reported driven from some trenches, and 3,500 prisoners and much\r\nmaterial captured. On July 22 the fall of Goritz and Tolmino was\r\nreported to be near, the War Office in Rome announcing a development\r\nof the offensive \"along the whole front from Monte Nero to the Carso\r\nPlateau. Vienna reported that the heavy attacks were being repulsed.\r\nBut on July 23 the official report from Rome for the first time\r\ndeclared that the Italian armies in the battle along the whole Isonzo\r\nfront were achieving success,\" which was \"constantly becoming more\r\nclearly apparent.\" On July 24 a dispatch from Udine said that General\r\nCadorna was personally directing the battle in the presence of King\r\nVictor Emmanuel and the Duke of Aosta. A Milan dispatch to The London\r\nDaily News on July 25 reported the evacuation of Goritz by the\r\nAustrian General Staff in view of the imminence of its fall. Below\r\nappears a prospective account of Italy's formidable task, written on\r\nJuly 1 by an Italian correspondent of The London Morning Post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Task of Italy\r\n\r\n[By a Special Correspondent of The London Morning Post]\r\n\r\n\r\nCormons, July 1.\r\n\r\nThe Italian battle for the conquest of the fortified lines on the\r\nIsonzo and the entrenched camps of Gorizia is one of the most\r\nimportant in the European conflict. The battle of the Isonzo is not to\r\nbe regarded as a mere episode, but a prolonged siege over a front of\r\nmore than a hundred miles of a natural fortress, consisting of a chain\r\nof precipitous mountains. Perhaps never before in a European war has\r\nthe value of individual qualities been shown so conclusively as by the\r\nItalian troops in this war. The very steep cliffs, which are almost\r\nperpendicular, along the course of the river are almost impossible to\r\nscale. The mountain passes which open along the river are very few and\r\nalso narrow. In addition the geological nature of that district,\r\ncomposed of strong walls of granite towers, which dominate the River\r\nIsonzo, is favorable to its defence.\r\n\r\nTo this natural defense have been added strong fortifications built by\r\nthe Austrians during past years in anticipation of being used for the\r\nsubjugation of Italians at some time or other. Finally, during the\r\nlast nine months of Italy's neutrality the Austrians have employed the\r\nlatest technical improvements in defensive warfare, and I have never\r\nseen their equal during my excursions to the front in France and\r\nBelgium, not even at Antwerp. This remark applies especially to Carso\r\nand Gorizia.\r\n\r\nThe artillery officers of the Italian Military Staff whom I met at the\r\nfront have explained to me the nature of the Austrian defensive works.\r\nUpon the Carso and around Gorizia the Austrians have placed\r\ninnumerable batteries of powerful guns mounted on rails and protected\r\nby armor plates. Numerous other artillery advantages are possessed by\r\nthe Austrians in the form of medium and smaller guns, though the\r\nefficiency of their action is modified by the long distances\r\nseparating the armies.\r\n\r\nIn view of these advantages possessed by the Austrians, the Italians\r\nhave accomplished marvels and are worthy of great admiration. The\r\ninfantry is much exposed while crossing large and deep rivers. With\r\nthe exception of the two positions of Podgora and Sabotino, all the\r\nAustrian line on the Isonzo has been taken by the Italians.\r\n\r\nTo the conquest of Gorizia are directed the efforts of the Eastern\r\nItalian Army. The Italian infantry which crossed the Isonzo ran\r\nagainst a net of trenches which the Austrians had excavated and\r\nconstructed in cement all along the edge of the hills which dominate\r\nthe course of the river. These trenches, already occupying a position\r\nnearly impregnable because so mountainous, are defended by every\r\nmodern protective device. They are armed with numerous machine-guns\r\nsurrounded by wire entanglements, through which runs a strong electric\r\ncurrent. These lines of trenches follow without interruption from the\r\nbanks of the Isonzo to the summit of the mountains which dominate it.\r\nThey form a kind of formidable staircase, which must be conquered step\r\nby step with enormous sacrifice. The Italian troops have accomplished\r\nthis marvel.\r\n\r\nThe crossing of the Isonzo and the conquest of the first mountainous\r\npositions were accomplished by the Italians in four strategic places:\r\nAt Caporetto, at Tolurino, at Plava, and at Sagrado. These four\r\nplaces, situated in the strong line of Austrian defense, are about\r\ntwenty miles distant from one another. The chain of fortifications of\r\nwhich Gorizia is a center was broken in these four essential points.\r\nThe immediate effect has been the disorganization of the defensive\r\nplans of the enemy. The crossing of the river was accomplished\r\ngenerally at night, and was conducted with a rapidity which took the\r\nenemy by surprise. Complete regiments crossed in the night upon light\r\nbridges constructed in a short time by the engineers, whose technical\r\nskill was equal to their audacity. These \"bridge-heads,\" which were\r\nconstructed with incredible courage, made possible an attack by the\r\nreinforcements which followed them. When these came in contact with\r\nthe lower lines of the Austrian trenches they attacked the defenders\r\nin such a way that the latter were unable to impede seriously the more\r\nimportant work of the construction of strong bridges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Devoted Nations\r\n\r\nBy MAURICE MAETERLINCK\r\n\r\n     The subjoined letter, dedicated by the Belgian writer to\r\n     stricken Poland, was received on July 12, 1915, by the\r\n     Polish Relief Committee of New York, of which Mme. Marcella\r\n     Sembrich is President.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Name of Belgium I Bring the Homage of a Martyred Nation to the\r\nNation Crucified:\r\n\r\nOf all the people engaged in this frightful war, Poland and Belgium\r\nwill have suffered most, and we must add (though all the horrors of\r\nwar are most revolting) they will have suffered most innocently. They\r\nare two victims of their innocence and grandeur of soul.\r\n\r\nIn misfortune and in glory their fates are the same. One, in\r\nsacrificing herself wholly to a cult, to an unparalleled passion for\r\nhonor, has by breaking the first blow of barbarous invasion probably\r\nsaved Europe, just as the other, the older sister, in grief and\r\nheroism several centuries ago saved Europe many times.\r\n\r\nThey are now joined forever in the memory of men. Across the combats\r\nand the sorrows which they are now enduring their hands meet in the\r\nsame sacrifice, in the same invincible hope. Today these countries are\r\nbut ruins. Nothing remains of them. They appear to be dead. But we,\r\nwho are their sons and who know them as we know our mother, we know,\r\nwe feel in our hearts, that they were never more alive, never purer,\r\nnever more beautiful.\r\n\r\nAfter having offered to the world a great example of pride, of\r\nabnegation, of heroism, they are again giving to it a deeper lesson, a\r\nmore valuable, a more efficacious one. They are proving that no\r\nmisfortune counts, that nothing is lost while the soul does not\r\nabdicate. The powers of darkness will never prevail against the forces\r\nof light and love that are leading humanity towards the heights which\r\nvictory is already making clear to us on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRumania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece\r\n\r\nComment About Continued Neutrality from the Balkan and Russian\r\nCapitals\r\n\r\n\r\nAn elaborate argument that Italy is about to co-operate with the\r\nAllies at the Dardanelles in order to influence Greece and the Balkan\r\nStates generally to intervene against the Germanic Powers appeared in\r\nThe Frankfurter Zeitung near the close of June. A dispatch from\r\nBucharest on July 12 announced that Austria had made concessions to\r\nRumania in the hope of averting intervention by that Power,\r\naccompanying the offer with an ultimatum setting a month for Rumania's\r\nreply. The German Social-Democratic paper Vorwaerts published on July\r\n17 a statement that Rumania had definitely refused to permit German\r\narms and ammunition to traverse her territory to Turkey. This shows a\r\ndistinct turning away from the German propaganda in that kingdom,\r\nwhich on May 26 spoke through the editorial columns of Moldova, a\r\ndaily of Bucharest, as follows:\r\n\r\n     We must tread in the path opened to us by the late King\r\n     Carol and the great Rumanian statesmen. We must always be\r\n     attached to the Central European Powers, from which we shall\r\n     secure the fulfillment of our aspirations, on that day when\r\n     we shall move against Russia.\r\n\r\nFrom Lupte, a Nationalist daily of Bucharest, a definite declaration\r\nof the kingdom's policy was demanded on June 4:\r\n\r\n     The smaller a nation is the more dangerous to her existence\r\n     are diplomatic intrigues. Mr. Bratiano's Government has for\r\n     the past eight months been coquetting with Petrograd as well\r\n     as with Berlin and Vienna. With which side are we in this\r\n     war? The two belligerent groups are asking this and the same\r\n     question is asked of Bulgaria and Greece. We must have a\r\n     sound national policy, for in this most modern war there is\r\n     no profit in the old Machiavellian tactics.\r\n\r\nThat a crisis is approaching in Balkan affairs is clearly indicated in\r\nan editorial warning headed \"Beware, ye Balkan Peoples!\" appearing on\r\nMay 29 in Dnevnik, an independent Bulgarian daily of Sofia. It says:\r\n\r\n     The lust of Europe for territorial aggrandizement becomes\r\n     every day more pronounced. From a struggle for self-defense\r\n     this has become a war of conquest. Germany has appropriated\r\n     Belgium, Russia fights for the Bosporus and Constantinople,\r\n     Italy has almost taken Albania--with the approval of\r\n     Austria, as we have discovered. The westernmost edge of the\r\n     Balkan Peninsula has fallen; tomorrow the easternmost\r\n     extremity will fall, together with Constantinople. Will the\r\n     European Powers then spare us?... What the United States of\r\n     America did for the preservation of their independence\r\n     against foreign conquest we Balkan peoples must do unless we\r\n     would see our doom sealed.\r\n\r\n\"The Dangers of a Neutral Policy\" is the theme of Mir, the organ of\r\nthe Bulgarian Nationalist Party of Sofia, which on May 29 said: \"If\r\nBulgaria remains neutral to the end of the war, she runs the risk of\r\nbeing condemned to live forever within the narrow limits she has\r\ntoday, hemmed in on every side. The duty of the Balkan States is to\r\nact in a war which will solve all pending political and national\r\nproblems.\"\r\n\r\nSerbia's jealousy of Italy, despite that nation's late adhesion to the\r\nAllies, was voiced on May 25 by Politika, a Nationalist daily of\r\nBelgrade, which accuses Italy of trying to profit at Serbia's expense.\r\nThe Entente Powers must pay for Italian aid, this paper says; and\r\nItaly may be \"satisfied with Savoy, Corsica, Malta, Tunis, Algiers,\r\nAsia Minor, or Egypt.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Balkan Newspapers\r\n\r\nIn the left upper corner, the Bulgarian daily Narodai Prava (National\r\nRights) of Sofia, semi-official organ of the Bulgarian Government of\r\nDr. B. Radoslavoff; upper right, the Athenian daily Athinae (Athens),\r\nrepresenting the extreme anti-Venizelists; at lower right, the daily\r\nPolitika (Politics), an independent paper of Belgrade, Serbia; lower\r\nleft, the Bucharest (Rumania) daily Dimineata (Morning), an\r\nInterventionist paper, and, at center, the Constantinople Khavar\r\n(Star), a Pro-Islamist daily.]\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman Empire being under martial law, comment by the Turkish\r\npapers regarding military and political events is restricted by the\r\nGovernment. But Enver Pasha, the all-powerful young Turk leader, and\r\nhis colleague for the Interior, Talaat Bey, early in May gave an\r\ninterview printed in the Vienna Neue Freie Presse. Enver Pasha\r\npredicts the collapse of the Allied campaign on the Gallipoli\r\nPeninsula, where the French and British hold a small corner against\r\noverwhelming odds. \"The bringing thither of provisions is extremely\r\ndifficult,\" he says, and \"even the drinking water for the troops must\r\nbe brought from the ships.\" Both he and Talaat Bey report the morale\r\nof the Turkish troops to be excellent, \"as many of the older officers\r\nhave been replaced by energetic young men.\"\r\n\r\nGreece is in suspense. The Kairoi, an independent daily of Athens,\r\nsaid on June 22 that, while Greece does not forget her debt to the\r\nthree protective powers, France, England, and Russia, she must\r\nnevertheless weigh the promise of Germany to give full protection to\r\nGreek interests in the event of her continued neutrality. \"Just how\r\nGermany keeps her promises,\" this paper says, is \"shown by Cavalla,\r\nthe Macedonian city allotted to Greece after the second Balkan war at\r\nthe express instance of the Kaiser;\" and it notes that the Entente\r\nPowers are now eager to cede this territory to Bulgaria. The Embros,\r\nan independent daily of Athens, prophesied on June 22:\r\n\r\n     We can afford to follow events with growing solicitude and\r\n     remain neutral as long as we may. Whether or not we maintain\r\n     this neutrality to the end our action can change neither the\r\n     fortunes of Greece nor the position of other Powers. It is\r\n     to be presumed that the power driving this giant conflict to\r\n     the conclusion has more remote motives and that to all\r\n     appearance, the war will end without any of the participants\r\n     suffering a crushing defeat.\r\n\r\nWhile Russian aspirations are generally considered to be in harmony\r\nwith those of the Balkan kingdoms, the following extracts from Russian\r\npapers representing varying shades of Muscovite opinion show now an\r\nunfavorable or critical attitude. Thus the foremost organ of the\r\nPanslavist Party, the Russian weekly Slavianski Izvestija, April No.\r\n8, disapproved the Bulgarian plea to give Thrace and Adrianople\r\nthrough Russian influence. Of the Macedonian question this paper\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Bulgarians expect that Russia will get for them Macedonia\r\n     Thrace, and Dobrudja, to reward their honest labors. Alas,\r\n     they must learn that not every day, but every hour,\r\n     Macedonia is receding from their grasp. For Russia the\r\n     Macedonian question hardly exists. If Macedonia finds it\r\n     hard to be under heroic and benevolent Serbia, what would\r\n     become of her on the day when she should fall into the hands\r\n     of Bulgaria? And should we Russians, in order to assure\r\n     Macedonia such a future, grieve now our dear ally Serbia?\r\n\r\nThe semi-official Novoye Vremya of Petrograd commented on May 27, on\r\nthe statement of the Bulgarian Premier Radoslavoff published in\r\nVienna, that Bulgaria cannot engage to intervene without a formal\r\ntreaty, a policy, it believes, that says but one thing, namely: \"You\r\nRussians tricked us Bulgarians once; you shall not trick us again.\"\r\nThis attitude of Bulgaria shows, the Novoye Vremya thinks, \"how\r\nthick-headed and insensate its people are.\" The Birjevaja Viedomosti,\r\na standpat Russian daily of Petrograd, on May 23 warned Serbia that,\r\nwhereas the war began in her behalf and on her account rivers of blood\r\nare flowing, her complaints of the allotment of Dalmatia to Italy\r\nshould not \"assert principles which have nothing to do with\r\nactualities.\" The same newspaper says of the whole Balkan situation:\r\n\r\n     The German policy of von Buelow, having failed in Rome, is\r\n     courting failure in Bucharest. In fact, all the German\r\n     promises to Rumania seem to go no further than sharpening\r\n     the Rumanian appetite for Russian Bessarabia, while holding\r\n     out as a last bait the cession of a small parcel of\r\n     Bukowina--supposing the Hungarians never consent to yielding\r\n     Transylvania to Rumania.\r\n\r\n     On the other hand, Germany promises Bulgaria the Turkish\r\n     province of Thrace and Serbian and Greek Macedonia; but\r\n     these compensations have as much value as the cessions of\r\n     Corsica and Nice and Tunis in the early days of the war.\r\n\r\nBut Germany cannot give to Bulgaria Serbian Macedonia so long as the\r\nAustrian armies are not masters of the whole of Serbia; she cannot\r\ngive her Thrace because Turkey objects to such cession, and Turkey is\r\nher ally; and, finally, she cannot urge Greece too closely to cede\r\nCavalla to Bulgaria, because such a pressure may bring a contrary\r\nresult, i.e. make Greece to declare herself openly an ally of the\r\nEntente. Therefore both Bulgaria and Rumania must perforce side with\r\nthe great European Alliance. Had Italy remained neutral matters would\r\nbe different, but as it is now Bulgars and Rumanians, and the Balkan\r\npeoples in general, have to fight with us, unless they want the\r\ndiplomacy of the Entente to disappoint utterly the ever-growing\r\nappetite of these small nationalities....\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that all the opinions quoted concerning the Balkans\r\nrelate to the division of territory as the price of neutrality or\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Conybeare's Recantation\r\n\r\nBy SIR WALTER RALEIGH\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the [London] Times:_\r\n\r\nSir,--During a recent visit to America I saw Dr. Conybeare's letter in\r\na paper called the _Vital Issue_. All who know Dr. Conybeare know him\r\nto be honest and frank, and to be very deeply distressed by the\r\nsufferings and cruelties of the war. After my return, I wrote to him,\r\npointing out that his letter is being widely circulated in America,\r\nand that the material points in his accusation of Sir Edward Grey and\r\nMr. Asquith have been answered. I enclose Dr. Conybeare's reply, for\r\nwhich he desires the fullest publicity.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\nWALTER RALEIGH.\r\n\r\nThe Hangings, Ferry Hinksey, near Oxford, July 1, 1915.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBanbury-road, Oxford, June 30.\r\n\r\nDear Sir Walter Raleigh,--During the past week I have been studying\r\nafresh the published records of the diplomatic transactions of last\r\nJuly, and on my return to Oxford I find your kind letter, and\r\ntherefore take the liberty of addressing this to yourself. My new\r\nstudy has forced upon me the conviction that in my letter to a friend\r\nresiding in America, which, against my wishes and injunctions, was\r\npublished there, apart from the deplorable tone of my allusions to Sir\r\nE. Grey and Mr. Asquith, I was quite wrong in imputing the motives\r\nwhich I did, especially to the former. It does appear to me, as I read\r\nthese dispatches over again, that Sir Edward throughout had in view\r\nthe peace of Europe, and that I ought to have set down to the awful\r\ncontingencies with which he was faced many passages which I was guilty\r\nof grossly misinterpreting. I was too ready to forget that in the\r\nyears of the Balkan wars it was after all he alone who, by his patient\r\nand conciliatory treatment of the situation, held in check the\r\nantagonistic forces which last July he was ultimately unable to\r\ncontrol. I was too ready to ascribe to want of good will on his part\r\nresults which harsh necessity entailed on him; and I deeply regret\r\nthat I mistook his aims and, in my endeavour to be fair to the enemy,\r\nwas grossly unjust to him. I am only anxious to undo, if it be still\r\npossible, some of the harm which my hasty judgment and intemperate\r\nlanguage has caused.\r\n\r\nIf you think it would do any good to print this, I beg you to send it\r\nto _The Times_ and _Morning Post_, whose remarks led me to go back\r\nonce more to the documentary sources. Second thoughts are best, and if\r\nI had only kept my American letter till the morning for revision, I\r\nshould first have struck out all the vituperation and all the\r\nimputation of motives, and have ended by never sending it at all.\r\n\r\nI remain yours very sincerely,\r\n\r\nFRED. C. CONYBEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Case of Muenter\r\n\r\nAttack on Mr. Morgan's Life and the Setting of Fire-Bombs on Ships\r\n\r\n\r\nThat a group of bankers in New York City, headed by J.P. Morgan &\r\nCompany, was negotiating with the British Treasury authorities for the\r\nflotation in the United States of $100,000,000 of the new British war\r\nloan was announced in the newspapers on July 3, 1915. Mr. Morgan's\r\nfirm had handled contracts to furnish war munitions to the Allies,\r\namounting to $500,000,000, and this had been widely published. On the\r\nmorning of July 3 J.P. Morgan was attacked and wounded with a revolver\r\nat his country estate on East Island, near Glen Cove, Long Island, by\r\nErich Muenter, alias Frank Holt. Holt was an Instructor in German at\r\nCornell University; Muenter was a Harvard instructor for whom the\r\npolice had been seeking since the spring of 1906 on a charge of\r\nmurdering his wife. After his suicide in jail on July 6, Professor\r\nC.N. Gould, of the University of Chicago, and Professor Hugo\r\nMuensterberg, of Harvard, among others, identified Holt and Muenter as\r\nthe same person.\r\n\r\nMuenter's insane attack on Mr. Morgan, because he had failed to \"use\r\nhis influence to prevent the exportation of arms and ammunition,\"\r\nfollowed the wrecking of the United States Senate reception room in\r\nthe Capitol at Washington on July 2 by the explosion of an infernal\r\nmachine set by Muenter. On July 6 a trunk owned by Muenter containing\r\ntwenty pounds of explosives was found in New York. During his stay in\r\njail Muenter wrote to his wife that two ships were to sink at sea on\r\nJuly 7, if his calculations went right, naming the Philadelphia and\r\nthe Saxonia. The ships were duly warned by wireless, but no bombs were\r\nfound aboard them, nor were any confederates of Muenter discovered. On\r\nJuly 7 the steamship Minnehaha reported by wireless a \"fire caused by\r\nexplosion\" under control.\r\n\r\nIncendiary bombs had been discovered aboard four freight steamships\r\nsailing from New York for Havre in April and May. On July 12 Secretary\r\nof the Navy Daniels, acting on advices received from The New Orleans\r\nPicayune, directed the naval radio station at Arlington, Virginia, to\r\nflash a warning to all ships at sea to be on the lookout for bombs\r\nsupposed to have been placed on board certain vessels, and warning\r\nparticularly the steamers Howth Head and Baron Napier that information\r\nhad come to the Navy Department that explosive bombs might have been\r\nplaced on those two vessels. All ships were requested to try to\r\ncommunicate with the Howth Head and the Baron Napier. On July 11 a\r\nwritten threat to assassinate J.P. Morgan, Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the\r\nBritish Ambassador, and destroy by bombs British ships clearing from\r\nAmerican ports, thus carrying out some of the plans of Erich Muenter,\r\nwas reported in a letter signed \"Pearce,\" who styled himself a partner\r\nand intimate associate of Muenter. This letter was received by The New\r\nOrleans Times-Picayune.\r\n\r\nTwo more \"Pearce\" letters were received on July 13 by an afternoon\r\nnewspaper of New Orleans and by its Chief of Police, saying that Erich\r\nMuenter had taught the writer the use of explosives. On the same day\r\nthe Samland of the Atlantic Transport Line and the Strathlay,\r\nchartered by the Fabre Line, survived attempts to destroy them by fire\r\nbombs, and on July 15 \"Pearce\" threatened in another letter to destroy\r\nthe Rochambeau. A bomb thought to be intended for the Orduna in a car\r\nloaded with coal consigned to the Cunard Line was discovered at\r\nMorrisville, N.J., on July 18. The Washington Times, the Philadelphia\r\nPublic-Ledger and the Brooklyn Eagle received on July 16, 19 and 20,\r\nrespectively, letters from \"Pearce\" declaring that henceforth persons\r\nleaving America on British ships would do so at their peril, and\r\nharking back to the German Embassy's warning before the Lusitania was\r\ntorpedoed. On July 26 an SOS call was received at the Fire Island\r\nstation, at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and by the coast guard ship\r\nMohawk, but the distressed ship's appeal for help was broken off\r\nbefore her name or position could be given. \"Pearce's\" letter to The\r\nBrooklyn Eagle reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Sir: You people of Brooklyn have already had one experience with the\r\nwork of our men, and so, perhaps, it will be unnecessary to say more\r\nthan a few words of warning. The Kirkoswald affair is still fresh in\r\nyour memory; therefore, we will not waste words discussing this\r\nmatter. The purpose of this communication is to warn the American\r\ncitizens living in your vicinity to keep clear of British vessels\r\nsailing from Brooklyn, New York, New Orleans, Savannah, Newport News,\r\nand Montreal. Our men are now operating from each of these ports, and\r\nAmericans will do well to heed this warning ere it is too late.\r\n\r\n\"The Imperial German Government derives no satisfaction or profit from\r\nthe killing of neutral Americans, and we are instructed to go to great\r\nlengths in order to give timely warnings to all Americans who\r\ncontemplate voyages to Europe within the next two months. The\r\nexplosive operations will supplement the submarine operations, which\r\nhave proved inadequate to prevent the enemy from importing munitions\r\nfrom America.\r\n\r\n\"We earnestly advise Americans who find it imperative to travel to\r\nEurope to sail only on vessels flying the American flag. Such steamers\r\nas those of the American Line, for instance, will be perfectly immune\r\nfrom either submarine or explosive operation. The Imperial German\r\nGovernment will, if requested, offer no objection to the American\r\nGovernment pressing into service the interned German vessels if the\r\nAmerican vessels are found to be unable to accommodate the traffic to\r\nEurope. By publishing this warning American lives may be spared.\r\n\r\n\"The circumstances under which this communication is written make it\r\nimpossible for us to affix our proper signatures; therefore, we trust\r\nthat you will accept for a signature our pen name.\r\n\r\n\"PEARCE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevotion to the Kaiser\r\n\r\n\r\n_The annual general conference of the clergy of the North German\r\nLutheran Churches met in Berlin during the week of June 24, 1915, and\r\nsent the following \"telegram of devotion\" to the Kaiser:_\r\n\r\n\"Your Imperial and Royal Majesty will most graciously deign to accept\r\nthis most humble blessing and the assurance of true German devotion\r\nfrom the preachers of the North German Evangelical Conference\r\nassembled in conference. We raise our eyes with respect and love to\r\nyour Majesty, the powerful and purposeful leader of the German nation.\r\nWe are filled with the consciousness that the sources of German power\r\nare unconquerable, not only because of the complete union of the\r\nGerman princes and peoples, but because of the unexampled spirit of\r\nsacrifice which animates rich and poor alike, and, before all else,\r\nbecause we are a praying nation.\r\n\r\n\"However great the pressure of our enemies may be on our victorious\r\narmies, the army of those who are praying at home will wrestle all the\r\nmore earnestly in prayer, praying before God's throne for victory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientists and the Military\r\n\r\nMovement in Great Britain and the United States to Consult Civilian\r\nExperts\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in June, H.G. Wells, the \"novelist of science,\" wrote to the\r\nLondon Times a letter urging the necessity of mobilizing Great\r\nBritain's scientific and inventive forces for the war. On June 22 The\r\nLondon Times printed a second letter from Mr. Wells proposing the\r\nestablishment of a bureau for inventors--\"a small department\r\ncollateral rather than subordinate to the War Office and Admiralty.\"\r\nAt the annual meeting in London of the British Science Guild on July\r\n1, eminent scientists and chemists, Sir William Mather, Sir William\r\nRamsay, Sir Boverton Redwood, Sir Philip Magnus, Professor Petry, Sir\r\nRonald Ross, Sir Archibald Geikie and Sir Alexander Pedler, condemned\r\nthe attitude adopted by the British Government toward science in\r\nconnection with the war, and demanded that in future greater use\r\nshould be made of the opportunities afforded by scientific knowledge\r\nin the prosecution of the struggle. A letter conveying this opinion\r\nwas sent by these scientists to Prime Minister Asquith. On July 18 it\r\nwas announced in London that a number of eminent scientists and\r\ninventors had been appointed to assist Admiral Lord Fisher, as\r\nChairman of the Invention Board, to co-ordinate and encourage\r\nscientific work in relation to the requirements of the British navy.\r\nLord Bryce was said to be instrumental in this undertaking.\r\n\r\nIn the United States a similar movement was in progress. THE NEW YORK\r\nTIMES published on May 30 an interview with Thomas A. Edison declaring\r\nthat in its preparations for war the American Government should\r\n\"maintain a great research laboratory, jointly under military and\r\nnaval and civilian control.\" In this could be developed the\r\n\"continually increasing possibilities of great guns, the minutiae of\r\nnew explosives, all the technique of military and naval progression,\r\nwithout any vast expense.\" If any foreign power should seriously\r\nconsider an attack upon this country \"a hundred men of special\r\ntraining quickly would be at work here upon new means of repelling the\r\ninvaders,\" Mr. Edison said; \"I would be at it, myself.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Navy Daniels thereupon wrote to Mr. Edison a\r\ncongratulatory letter, saying: \"I think your ideas and mine coincide\r\nif an interview with you recently published in THE NEW YORK TIMES was\r\ncorrect.\" He added:\r\n\r\n     One of the imperative needs of the navy, in my judgment, is\r\n     machinery and facilities for utilizing the natural inventive\r\n     genius of Americans to meet the new conditions of warfare as\r\n     shown abroad, and it is my intention if a practical way can\r\n     be worked out, as I think it can be, to establish at the\r\n     earliest moment a department of invention and development,\r\n     to which all ideas and suggestions, either from the service\r\n     or from civilian inventors, can be referred for\r\n     determination as to whether they contain practical\r\n     suggestions for us to take up and perfect....\r\n\r\n     What I want to ask is if you would be willing, as a service\r\n     to your country, to act as an adviser to this board, to take\r\n     such things as seem to you to be of value, but which we are\r\n     not, at present, equipped to investigate, and to use your\r\n     own magnificent facilities in such investigation if you feel\r\n     it worth while.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was Mr. Edison's appointment to head an advisory board\r\nof civilian inventors and engineers for a Bureau of Invention and\r\nDevelopment created in the Navy Department. After a conference with\r\nMr. Edison Secretary Daniels on July 19 wrote to eight leading\r\nscientific societies asking each of them to select two members to\r\nserve on the Naval Advisory Committee, and as a first fruit of the\r\nmovement it was announced on July 23 that at the request of Mr.\r\nEdison, the American Society of Aeronautic Engineers had been formed\r\nwith Henry A. Wise Wood as President and Orville Wright, Glenn H.\r\nCurtiss, W. Starling Burgess, Peter Cooper Hewitt, Elmer A. Sperry and\r\nJohn Hays Hammond, Jr., as Vice-presidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHudson Maxim on Explosives\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES _on July 11 printed an interview with Hudson Maxim,\r\nthe inventor of explosives, in which Mr. Maxim said:_\r\n\r\nModern war is a warfare of explosives. The highly developed methods of\r\ndefense, designed especially against explosives, are practically proof\r\nagainst everything but them.\r\n\r\nAttacking forces must disemburrow the defending forces; they must be\r\nblasted out of the ground. This warfare amounts, literally, to that.\r\nIt is as if boys hunted woodchucks with dynamite.\r\n\r\nEach of the hard-won successes of the war has been a victory for\r\nwell-placed high explosives. In the last fight around Przemysl the\r\nGermans fired in one hour, from field guns, 200,000 shells carrying\r\nhigh explosives.\r\n\r\nReports indicate that the result of this was literally unprecedented.\r\nIt actually changed the topography of the country. Valleys were dug\r\nand hills razed.\r\n\r\nRecently Lloyd George used an expressive phrase. \"The trenches,\" he\r\nsaid, \"were sprayed with exploding shells.\"\r\n\r\nSuch \"spraying\" only could be possible through the use of an\r\nincredible number of explosive projectiles.\r\n\r\nAmerica's plants for the production of explosives, cartridges,\r\nshrapnel, and rifles have so increased their capacity that we have\r\ntoday ten times the capacity which we had at the time of the war's\r\noutbreak, and, for certain things, the increase has been even greater.\r\nBy the middle of next winter our capacity will be thirtyfold what it\r\nwas at the beginning of the war.\r\n\r\nThus the fighting among other nations has done much toward preparing\r\nus for war, and, therefore, much toward insuring international peace\r\nfor us, but even our tremendous contribution to the supplies of the\r\nAllies amounts to only about 2 per cent. of what they are consuming,\r\nand the war has not been running a year.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that if we should suddenly be involved in warfare with\r\na great power we should be whipped unless we devised means for the\r\nincrease of our productivity of war supplies, especially explosives\r\nand all ammunition materials, by a hundredfold.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of war material has been unprecedented, and this\r\nindicates what may be expected in future wars. In trench fighting, for\r\nexample, it is estimated that four times as many rifles as men are\r\nrequired. The fighting man must have two because one quickly gets hot\r\nand becomes unusable; he must have a third so that he may still have\r\ntwo if one is hit by the return fire or otherwise rendered\r\ninefficient; he must have the fourth so that at least one of his\r\nweapons may be in the arms hospital undergoing repairs if necessary,\r\nand be ready for him in case one of his others is demolished. This\r\ndevelopment of modern warfare means that a million modern soldiers\r\nneed four million modern rifles.\r\n\r\nThis indicates the enormous necessities which would devolve upon this\r\ncountry in case we were forced into a war. During the past week I have\r\nreceived a cable from an old friend in England who has been selling\r\nwar munitions to the Allies. He asked me how quickly I could get a\r\nmillion rifles made in the United States. The best bids I have been\r\nable to obtain have guaranteed a first delivery at the end of one\r\nyear and final deliveries at the end of three years.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief developments in the matter of explosives has been the\r\nfact that the United States has found it possible to teach Europe much\r\nduring this war in regard to smokeless powder. Several years ago the\r\ndu Pont Powder Company developed a smokeless rifle powder which\r\npermits the firing of more than 20,000 rounds from an ordinary army\r\nrifle without destroying its accuracy.\r\n\r\nWhen the du Ponts developed their new rifle powder the best European\r\npowder destroyed the rifling and accuracy of the gun at about 3,000\r\nrounds. This American invention, therefore, has increased the life of\r\nmilitary rifles by sevenfold. Say that an equipment of military rifles\r\ncost at the rate of, say, $20 each, and we will find that this means a\r\nsaving of, roughly, $100,000,000 in the equipment of a million men\r\nwith one rifle each, and, as they need four rifles each, it means a\r\nsaving of $400,000,000.\r\n\r\nAmerican smokeless powder for cannon also has its advantages. It\r\nerodes the guns much less than any European powder except, possibly,\r\nthat of the Germans. They have a pure nitro-cellulose powder somewhat\r\nsimilar in quality to that of the United States, but ours has an\r\nadvantage in being multi-perforated, whereby a higher velocity is\r\ninsured at a lower pressure with, in consequence, a lessened erosive\r\neffect upon the guns.\r\n\r\nIn the early nineties I made the discovery that tri-nitro-cellulose,\r\nwhen combined with pyro-nitro-cellulose, could be much more readily\r\ngelatinated and made an excellent smokeless powder, while powder made\r\nfrom pure nitro-cellulose would warp and crack all to pieces in\r\ndrying. The present German powder is made from such a compound of\r\ntri-nitro-cellulose and soluble nitro-cellulose.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this compound is a makeshift as compared with the\r\nnitro-cellulose used by this Government. Ours is a far better\r\nexplosive, and is less erosive on the guns, because the gases which it\r\ngenerates are not so hot. We have the best smokeless powder in the\r\nworld, and, after this war is over, our powder will be universally\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThor!\r\n\r\nBy BEATRICE BARRY\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am the God of War--yea, God of Battle am I,\r\n    And the evil men speak about me has moved me to fierce reply.\r\n      Does not the surgeon's knife\r\n      Torture--to save a life?\r\n    So, for the life of nations, men learn to fight and die--\r\n          Even die!\r\n\r\n    Craven through love or fear do the weak of the earth await me\r\n    Tensely, with bated breath--yea, teaching their sons to hate me.\r\n      Lured by my rolling drum,\r\n      Nevertheless they come\r\n    Proudly, their youth and manhood offering up to sate me!\r\n\r\n    You who would grudge me aught but harvest of woe and shame--\r\n    Answer me, you who hate me, cursing my very name--\r\n      When was a serf made free,\r\n      Save and alone through me?\r\n    When was a tyrant vanquished, save through my purging flame?\r\n\r\n    After an age of peace do your sons wax soft, their weakness\r\n    Shown in a love of ease, of sensuousness, and sleekness;\r\n      Then, lest a nation die,\r\n      Loud rings my battle-cry!\r\n    Lo, they forsake snug warmth for desolate cold and bleakness!\r\n\r\n    I am the God of War--yea, God of Battle am I,\r\n    And the bolts of my savage anger I hurl from a threatening sky.\r\n      Speak of me as you will,\r\n      Swift though I be to kill,\r\n    I have made men of weaklings--I teach men how to die--\r\n          Even I!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am the Gravest Danger\"\r\n\r\nBy George Bernard Shaw\r\n\r\n\r\n_In a cablegram to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES, _dated July 17, 1915, it is\r\nreported that an article by George Bernard Shaw in The New Statesman\r\nbegins with a review of Professor Gilbert Murray's book, \"The Foreign\r\nPolicy of Sir Edward Grey,\" and ends with the following characteristic\r\nreference to himself:_\r\n\r\n\"Like other Socialists, I have been too much preoccupied with the\r\natrocities of peace and the problems they raise to pay due attention\r\nto the atrocities of war, but I have not been unconscious of the\r\nEuropean question and I have made a few shots at solutions from time\r\nto time. None of these have been received with the smallest approval,\r\nbut at least I may be permitted to point out that they have all come\r\nout right.\r\n\r\n\"I steadily ridiculed anti-armament agitation, and urged that our\r\narmaments should be doubled, trebled, quadrupled, as they might have\r\nbeen without costing the country one farthing that we were not wasting\r\nin the most mischievous manner.\r\n\r\n\"I said that the only policy which would secure the peace of Europe\r\nwas a policy of using powerful armament to guarantee France against\r\nGermany and Germany against Russia, aiming finally at a great peace\r\ninsurance league of the whole northwest of Europe with the United\r\nStates of America in defense of Western democratic civilization\r\nagainst the menace of the East and possible crusades from primitive\r\nblack Christians in Africa.\r\n\r\n\"When the war broke out I said some more things which were frantically\r\ncontradicted and which have all turned out to be precisely true. I set\r\nthe example of sharp criticism of the Government and the War Office,\r\nwhich was denounced as treasonable and which now proves to be the only\r\nway of saving our army from annihilation, the Government having\r\nmeanwhile collapsed and vanished, as every ordinarily self-possessed\r\nperson foresaw that it must.\r\n\r\n\"One fact seems established by this beyond doubt; to wit, that I am\r\nthe gravest public danger that confronts England, because I have the\r\nstrange power of turning the nation passionately away from the truth\r\nby the simple act of uttering it. The necessity for contradicting me,\r\nfor charging heroically in the opposite direction to that pointed out\r\nby me, is part of the delirium of war fever.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Edward Grey, on the other hand, is spoken well of by all men, but\r\nhe, too, is the victim of a mysterious fate. He is, as Professor\r\nMurray has repeatedly testified, the most truthful of men, yet he\r\nnever opens his mouth without deceiving us. He is the most loyal of\r\nsimple, manly souls, yet he is accused of betraying every country and\r\nevery diplomatist who trusted him.

Only in\r\n     France, whose people are making supreme sacrifices, and in\r\n     Russia, whose factories are not yet organized for the\r\n     nation, does industrial peace prevail. In England the\r\n     Munitions bill, with its proposals for compulsory\r\n     arbitration and for limiting profits unweakened, was passed\r\n     on July 1st. The bill retained, also, the power for the\r\n     Government to proclaim the extension of its strike-stopping\r\n     authority to other trades than the munitions trades.\r\n\r\n     An account of the conditions relating to labor in the\r\n     various countries, beginning with the speech, in part, of\r\n     Lloyd George, introducing the Munitions bill in the House of\r\n     Commons on June 20, appears below.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Volunteer Army of Workers\r\n\r\nBy Lloyd George, British Minister of Munitions\r\n\r\n_Addressing the House of Commons on June 20, 1915, Mr. Lloyd George\r\nsaid, in part:_\r\n\r\nWhat I want to impress not merely upon the House but on the country is\r\nthat the duration of the war, the toll of life and limb levied by the\r\nwar, the amount of exhaustion caused by the war, the economic and\r\nfinancial effect--and in order to understand the whole depth and\r\nmeaning of the problem with which we are confronted I would state the\r\nultimate victory or defeat in this war--depend on the supply of\r\nmunitions which the rival countries can produce to equip their armies\r\nin the field. That is the cardinal fact of the military situation in\r\nthis war. (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nI heard the other day on very good authority--and this will give the\r\nHouse an idea of the tremendous preparations made by the enemy for\r\nthis war and of the expansion which has taken place even since the\r\nwar--that the Central European Powers are turning out 250,000 shells\r\nper day. That is very nearly eight million shells per month. The\r\nproblem of victory for us is how to equal, how to surpass, that\r\ntremendous production. (Hear, hear.)\r\n\r\nThe Central European Powers have probably attained something like the\r\nlimits of their possible output. We have only just crossed the\r\nthreshold of our possibilities. In France I had the privilege of\r\nmeeting M. Thomas, the Under Secretary for War, a man to whose great\r\norganizing capacity a good deal of the success of the French\r\nprovisions of war is attributable, and I am very reassured not merely\r\nas to what France is doing and what France can do but as to what we\r\ncan do when I take into account what France has already accomplished.\r\n\r\nLet us see the position France is in. Her most important industrial\r\nprovinces were in the hands of the enemy. Seventy per cent. of her\r\nsteel production was in the hands of the enemy. She had mobilized an\r\nenormous army and therefore had withdrawn a very considerable\r\nproportion of her population from industry. She is not at best as\r\ngreat an industrial country as we are. She is much of an agricultural\r\nand pastoral country. It is true that we have certain disadvantages\r\ncompared with France, and they are important. She has not the same\r\ngigantic Navy to draw upon the engineering establishments of the\r\ncountry. That makes a very great difference. She has more complete\r\ncommand over her labor. That makes an enormous difference, not merely\r\nin the mobility of labor and the readiness with which she can transfer\r\nthat labor from one center to another, but in the discipline which\r\nobtains in the workshops. She has another advantage with her arsenals,\r\nwhich at the outbreak of war corresponded to the magnitude of her\r\nArmy--a huge Army. We had a small Army to provide for. She, in\r\naddition to that, had undoubtedly a very great trade with other\r\ncountries in the production of munitions of war. These are the\r\nadvantages and disadvantages. Still, knowing these things and taking\r\nthem all into account, the surplus of our engineering resources\r\navailable for the materials of war is undoubtedly greater than that of\r\nFrance, and if we produce these things within the next few months as\r\nmuch as they are likely to produce the Allies would not merely equal\r\nthe production of the Central Powers, but they would have an\r\noverwhelming superiority over the enemy in the material essential to\r\nvictory. That is the first great fact I would like to get into the\r\nminds of all those who can render assistance to the country.\r\n\r\nGermany has achieved a temporary preponderance of material. She has\r\ndone it in two ways. She accumulated great stores before the war. She\r\nhas mobilized the whole of her industries after the war, having no\r\ndoubt taken steps before the war to be ready for the mobilization of\r\nthe workshops immediately after war was declared. Her preponderance in\r\ntwo or three directions is very notable. I mention this because it is\r\nessential they should be understood in inviting the assistance of the\r\ncommunity to enable us to compete with this formidable enemy. The\r\nsuperiority of the Germans in material was most marked in their heavy\r\nguns, their high explosive shells, their rifles, and perhaps most of\r\nall their machine-guns. These have turned out to be about the most\r\nformidable weapons in the war. They have almost superseded the rifle\r\nand rendered it unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe machinery for rifles and machine-guns takes eight and nine months\r\nto construct before you begin to turn a single rifle or machine-gun.\r\nThe Germans have undoubtedly anticipated the character of the war in\r\nthe way no other Power has done. They realized it was going to be a\r\ngreat trench war. They had procured an adequate supply of machinery\r\napplicable to those conditions. The professional man was essentially a\r\nvery conservative one--(hear, hear)--and there are competent soldiers\r\nwho even today assume that his phase is purely a temporary one, that\r\nit would not last long, and we shall be back on the old lines.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt much time was lost owing to that opposition. The\r\nGermans never harbored that delusion, and were fully prepared to\r\nbatter down the deepest trenches of the enemy with the heavy guns and\r\nhigh explosives, and to defend their own trenches with machine-guns.\r\nThat is the story of the war for ten months. We assumed that victory\r\nwas rather due as a tribute from fate, and our problem now is to\r\norganize victory, and not take it for granted. (Cheers.) To do that\r\nthe whole engineering and chemical resources of this country--of the\r\nwhole Empire--must be mobilized. When that is done France and\r\nourselves alone, without Italy or Russia, can overtop the whole\r\nTeutonic output.\r\n\r\nThe plan on which we have proceeded until recently I explained to the\r\nHouse in April. We recognized that the arsenals then in existence were\r\nquite inadequate to supply the new Army or even the old Army, giving\r\nthe necessary material and taking into account the rate at which\r\nammunition was being expended. We had, therefore, to organize new\r\nsources of supply, and the War Office was of opinion that the best\r\nmethod of attaining that object was to work through existing firms,\r\nso as to have expert control and direction over companies and\r\nworkshops, which up to that time had no experience in turning out\r\nshells and guns and ammunition of all sorts. There was a great deal to\r\nbe said for that. There was, first of all, a difficulty unless\r\nsomething of that kind was done of mobilizing all the resources at the\r\ndisposal of the State. The total Army Estimates were L28,000,000 in\r\nthe year of peace. They suddenly became L700,000,000. All that\r\nrepresents not merely twenty or twenty-five times as much money; it\r\nmeans twenty or twenty-five times as much work. It means more than\r\nthat, because it has to be done under pressure. The sort of business\r\nwhich takes years to build up, develop, strengthen, and improve has\r\nsuddenly to be done in about five, six, seven, or eight months. The\r\nWar Office came to the conclusion that the best way of doing that was\r\nto utilize the skill of existing firms which were capable of doing\r\nthis work. The War Office staff are hard-working, capable men, but\r\nthere are not enough. There is one consideration which cannot be left\r\nout of account, and that is that men who are quite equal to running\r\nlong-established businesses run on old-established lines, may not\r\nalways be adequate to the task of organizing and administering a\r\nbusiness thirty times its size on novel and original lines.\r\n\r\nTo be quite candid, the organizing firms--the armament firms--were\r\nalso inadequate to the gigantic task cast upon them of not merely\r\norganizing their own work but of developing the resources of the\r\ncountry outside. They could not command the stock, and sub-contracting\r\nhas undoubtedly been a failure. Sub-contracting has produced something\r\nlike 10,000 shells a month. We have only been at it a few days, and we\r\nhave already placed with responsible firms orders for 150,000 shells a\r\nmonth. In a very short time I am confident it will be a quarter of a\r\nmillion or 300,000. (Cheers.) It is a process of inviting business men\r\nto organize themselves and to assist us to develop the resources of\r\ntheir district.\r\n\r\nWe have secured a very large number of business men; many business men\r\nare engaged in organizing and directing their own business, business\r\nwhich is just as essential to the State in a period of war as even the\r\norganization of this office; but still there are the services of many\r\nable business men which are available, and we propose to utilize them\r\nto the full, first, in the Central Office to organize it; secondly, in\r\nthe localities to organize the resources there; and, thirdly, we\r\npropose to have a great Central Advisory Committee of business men to\r\naid us to come to the right conclusions in dealing with the business\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nI should like just to point out two or three of the difficulties, in\r\norder to show the steps which are taken to overcome them. The first\r\ndifficulty, of course, is that of materials. There is, as I pointed\r\nout, material of which you have abundance in this country, but there\r\nare others which you have got to husband very carefully, and there is\r\nother material on which you have got to spend a considerable sum of\r\nmoney in order to be able to develop it at a later stage. With regard\r\nto this question, I think that it might be necessary ultimately for us\r\nto take complete control of the Metal Market, so that available\r\nmaterial should not be wasted on non-essential work. (Hear, hear.) To\r\na certain extent we have done that.\r\n\r\nI should like to say a word with regard to raw material for\r\nexplosives. We are building new factories so that the expansion of\r\nexplosives shall keep pace with that of shells, and in this respect,\r\nagain, I should like to dwell upon the importance of keeping up our\r\ncoal supplies in this country. It is the basis of all our\r\nhigh-explosives, and if there were a shortage for any reason the\r\nconsequences would be very calamitous.\r\n\r\nSometimes we do not get the best in these yards through the slackness\r\nof a minority and sometimes through regulations, useful, perhaps\r\nessential, in times of peace for the protection of men against undue\r\npressure and strain, but which in times of war have the effect of\r\nrestricting output. If these are withdrawn no doubt it increases the\r\nstrain on the men, and in a long course of years they could not stand\r\nit. But in times of war everybody is working at full strain, and\r\ntherefore it is difficult to exaggerate the importance of suspending\r\nrestrictions which have the effect of diminishing the output of war\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nThe fourth point is that the danger of having stoppages of work by\r\nmeans of strikes and lock-outs ought to be removed during the time of\r\nthe war. (Hear, hear.) I should have liked to have seen strikes and\r\nlock-outs during the war made impossible in any trade, and I do not\r\ndespair of getting the assent of those who object to compulsory\r\narbitration under normal conditions to a temporary application of that\r\nprinciple during the period of the war.\r\n\r\nThe next step is one in which the Trade Unions are concerned. There\r\nwas a very frank discussion between the leaders of the Trade Unions\r\nand myself, and I was bound to point out that if there were an\r\ninadequate supply of labor for the purpose of turning out munitions of\r\nwar which are necessary for the safety of the country compulsion would\r\nbe inevitable.\r\n\r\nThey put forward as an alternative that the Government should give\r\nthem the chance of supplying that number of men. They said, \"Give us\r\nseven days, and if in seven days we cannot get the men we will admit\r\nthat our case is considerably weakened.\" They asked us to place the\r\nwhole machinery of Government at their disposal, because they had not\r\nthe organization to enlist the number. We have arranged terms upon\r\nwhich the men are to be enlisted, and tomorrow morning the seven days\r\nbegin. Advertisements will appear in all the papers, an office has\r\nbeen organized, and the Trade Union representatives are sitting there\r\nin council directing the recruiting operations. I am not sure, but I\r\nbelieve my honorable friend Mr. Brace is the Adjutant-General.\r\nTomorrow we hope to be able to make a start. We have 180 town halls in\r\ndifferent parts of the country placed entirely at our disposal as\r\nrecruiting offices. We invite the assistance of everybody to try to\r\nsecure as many volunteers as they possibly can--men who are not\r\nengaged upon Government work now, skilled men--to enroll themselves in\r\nthe Trade Union army for the purpose of going anywhere where the\r\nGovernment invited them to go to assist in turning out different\r\nmunitions of war. If there are any honorable friends of mine who are\r\nopposed to compulsion, the most effective service they can render to\r\nvoluntarism is to make this army a success. (Cheers.) If we succeed by\r\nthese means--and the Board of Trade, the Munitions Department, and the\r\nWar Office are placing all their services at the disposal of this new\r\nrecruiting office--if within seven days we secure the labor, then the\r\nneed for industrial compulsion will to that extent have been taken\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALL TO BRITISH WORKERS\r\n\r\n_In a special cable dispatch to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES, _dated June 24,\r\nappeared the following:_\r\n\r\n\"England expects every workman to do his duty,\" is the new rendering\r\nof Nelson's Trafalgar signal which is being flagged throughout the\r\ncountry today. Lloyd George has issued an appeal to organized labor to\r\ncome forward within the next seven days in a last supreme effort on\r\nbehalf of the voluntary system, and if it fails nothing remains but\r\ncompulsion.\r\n\r\nThe appeal is being put before them by advertisements in newspapers,\r\nby speeches from labor leaders, and by meetings throughout the\r\ncountry. A new workmen's army is being recruited just as Kitchener's\r\narmy was, and only seven days are given to gather together what may be\r\ntermed a mobile army of industry. It is estimated that a quarter of a\r\nmillion men well equipped for the purposes required are available\r\noutside the ranks of those already engaged in the manufacture of\r\nmunitions. Nearly two hundred industrial recruiting offices throughout\r\nthe country opened at six o'clock last night, and, judging by reports\r\nalready to hand, the voluntary system seems again likely to justify\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"To British Workmen: Your skill is needed,\" runs one advertisement.\r\n\"There are thousands of skilled men who are burning to do something\r\nfor King and country. By becoming a war munitions volunteer each of\r\nthem can do his bit for his homeland. Get into a factory and supply\r\nthe firing line.\"\r\n\r\nPosters and small bills with both an artistic and literary \"punch\" are\r\nbeing prepared and sent out for distribution. Newspapers with special\r\nworking class clientele are making direct appeals to their readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEN THOUSAND MEN A DAY\r\n\r\n_Mr. H.E. Morgan, of the War Munitions Ministry, said in an interview\r\nprinted by The London Daily Chronicle on July 1:_\r\n\r\nThe War Munition Volunteers have amply justified their formation.\r\nDuring the last two days the enrolments throughout the country have\r\naveraged ten thousand skilled and fully qualified mechanics, who are\r\nexactly the type of worker we want. So far as the men are concerned,\r\nthe voluntary principle in industrial labor has triumphed.\r\n\r\nWe have already transferred a large number of skilled mechanics from\r\nnon-war work to munition making, and daily the number grows. London\r\ncompares excellently with other places as regards the number of\r\nvolunteers, but naturally most of the men are coming from the great\r\nengineering centres in the North and Midlands.\r\n\r\n\r\nA REGISTER OF 90,000\r\n\r\n_In a London dispatch of the Associated Press, dated July 16, this\r\nreport appeared:_\r\n\r\nAfter upward of a fortnight's work in the six hundred bureaus which\r\nwere opened when the Minister of Munitions, David Lloyd George, gave\r\nlabor the opportunity voluntarily to enroll as munitions operatives,\r\nclosed today with a total registration of ninety thousand men.\r\nRegistration hereafter will be carried out through the labor\r\nexchanges.\r\n\r\nMore men are needed, but the chief difficulty now is to place them on\r\nwar work with a minimum of red tape. H.G. Morgan, assistant director\r\nof the Munitions Department, said today that this problem was causing\r\nsome unrest among the workers, but that the transfers would take time,\r\nfor the Government was anxious not to disturb industry more than\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"The problem almost amounts to a rearrangement of the whole skilled\r\nlabor of the country,\" said Mr. Morgan. \"This, of course, will take\r\nconsiderable time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAMPAIGN CONTINUED\r\n\r\n_A cable dispatch from London to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _said on July\r\n15:_\r\n\r\nThe Daily Chronicle says that a campaign to urge munition workers to\r\neven greater efforts is to open today with a meeting at Grantham, and\r\nnext week meetings will be held at Luton, Gloucester, Stafford,\r\nPreston, and other centres. In the course of the next few weeks\r\nhundreds of meetings will take place in all parts of the Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe campaign has been organized by the Munitions Parliamentary\r\nCommittee, the secretaries of which have received the following letter\r\nfrom Munitions Minister Lloyd George:\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear that members of the House are responding so\r\nenthusiastically to my pressing appeal to them to undertake a campaign\r\nin the country to impress upon employers and workers in munitions\r\nshops the urgent and even vital necessity for a grand and immediate\r\nincrease in the output of munitions of war.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Mantoux has been asked by the French Munitions Minister to\r\nkeep in touch with the campaign and to report from time to time as to\r\nthe results achieved. It is felt that what affects England affects\r\nFrance, and later a similar campaign may be inaugurated in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSixty members of Parliament have promised to speak at the meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL STRIKE IN WALES\r\n\r\n_Most of the coal for Great Britain's navy comes from South Wales, and\r\nthe supply was reduced by the enlistment of sixty thousand Welsh\r\nminers in the army. The labor crisis was first threatened three months\r\nago, when the miners gave notice that they would terminate the\r\nexisting agreements on July 1, and, in lieu of these, they proposed a\r\nnational program, giving an all-around increase in wages. The owners\r\nobjected to the consideration of the new terms during the war and\r\nasked the miners to accept the existing agreements plus a war bonus.\r\nAfter a series of conferences the union officials agreed to recommend\r\na compromise, which was arranged through the Board of Trade. The\r\nminers, however, voted yesterday against this, and the Government was\r\nobliged to take action._\r\n\r\n_On July 16 the Associated Press cabled from London:_\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee of the South Wales Miners' Federation, most of\r\nthe members of which are opposed to the strike, came to London today\r\nand conferred with Walter Runciman, President of the Board of Trade,\r\nwho, it is understood, made new proposals for a settlement of the\r\ntrouble, which will be considered at a meeting in the morning.\r\n\r\nThere is no indication of any weakening on the part of the men. Even\r\nthe men in one district who last night decided to resume work reversed\r\ntheir decision, and not a pick was moving today.\r\n\r\nHowever, the impression still prevails that a few days will see an end\r\nof the walkout. It is not believed that the introduction of the\r\nMunitions of War act can force the men to return to work, for it is\r\nimpossible to bring 150,000 men before the courts to impose fines for\r\ncontravening the act.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the resort to this measure is believed rather to have made\r\nthe situation worse, and the men's demands now include its withdrawal\r\nso far as coal mining is concerned.\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch from Cardiff, Wales, on July 20\r\nreported:_\r\n\r\nSubject to ratification by the miners themselves through delegates who\r\nwill assemble tomorrow, representatives of the Government and of the\r\ncoal mine owners on the one hand, and the Executive Committee of the\r\nSouth Wales Miners' Federation on the other, agreed today to terms\r\nthat, it is thought, will end the coal miners' strike, which, since\r\nlast Thursday, has tied up the South Wales coal fields and menaced the\r\nfuel supply of the navy.\r\n\r\nThe terms arrived at grant a substantial increase in wages and involve\r\nconcessions to the strikers which are considered by their Executive\r\nCommittee as tantamount to an admission of the miners' claims on\r\nnearly all the outstanding points. Tonight the delegates were visiting\r\ntheir districts, canvassing the sentiment there preparatory to\r\ntomorrow's vote.\r\n\r\nIf tomorrow's meeting should bring a settlement of the strike the\r\nthanks of the country will go chiefly to David Lloyd George, the\r\nMunitions Minister, for it was his arrival here last night that paved\r\nthe way for breaking the deadlock between the miners and the mine\r\nowners.\r\n\r\nIf the vote tomorrow is favorable to ending the strike, two hundred\r\nthousand men will return to work immediately and agree to abide by the\r\nterms of the settlement until six months after the termination of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMMUNITION IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n_M. Millerand, French Minister of War, after the Senate had approved,\r\non June 29, the bill appropriating $1,200,000,000 for war expenses of\r\nthe third quarter of the year, reported as quoted by the Associated\r\nPress:_\r\n\r\nFrom August 1 to April 1 France has increased her military production\r\nsixfold. The curve for munitions has never ceased to mount, nor that\r\nrepresenting the manufacture of our 75s. I can give satisfying\r\nassurances also regarding the heavy artillery and small arms. From the\r\n1st of January to the 15th of May the other essentials of the war have\r\nbeen equally encouraging. We are determined to pursue our enemies,\r\nwhatever arms they may employ.\r\n\r\n_Yves Guyot, the economist and late Minister of Public Works in\r\nFrance, said to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _correspondent on July 3:_\r\n\r\nFrance can hold her own against Germany. She herself makes all the\r\nshells that play such havoc in the enemy's ranks, and she will keep on\r\nmaking all she needs.\r\n\r\nThe munitions problem in France is not so acute as in England. In\r\nFrance as soon as the war started we began turning out the shells as\r\nfast as our factories could work. So, in a short time, they were going\r\nfull blast. We have been able to supply our army with ample ammunition\r\nand to have shells enough to shake up the enemy whenever we put on\r\nspurts.\r\n\r\nIt is vitally important that England has come to the realization of\r\nthe need of equipping her own army with adequate ammunition. Up to now\r\nthe English Army has been sadly handicapped, but with the energetic\r\nLloyd George in command the munitions output in the near future is\r\ncertain to bring a sudden change in the status of England in the war.\r\n\r\nWe in France being in such immediate contact with the horrors of war\r\nhad a stern sense of the necessity of fully equipping our army forced\r\nupon us at the very beginning of the conflict. The only thing we have\r\nlacked has been steel, and we have been getting some of that from our\r\nold friend, the United States. France has steel plants, and they do a\r\ntremendous amount of work, but altogether they do not turn out enough\r\nfor our ammunition works. So we had to turn elsewhere for some of this\r\nproduct, and it was America that came to our aid.\r\n\r\nWe have got the steel with which to make shells. Our workmen are well\r\norganized and the whole spirit prevailing among them is to help France\r\nto win the bloodiest war of her history.\r\n\r\n_The London Daily Chronicle in an interview with Albert Thomas, French\r\nMinister of Munitions, quoted him as follows on July 8:_\r\n\r\nIt is our duty to organize victory. To this we are bending all our\r\nenergies. The war may be long; difficulties may reach us of which we\r\nhad no prevision at the start; but we shall keep on until the end.\r\n\r\nWe know how great are the resources of Britain. We know what immense\r\nefforts she has put forth, which have been a surprise not only to us\r\nbut to the enemy as well, and we have every reason for believing and\r\nknowing that these immense resources will continue to be used in the\r\nservice of the Allies.\r\n\r\nUnderstand me, I do not say that our common task is an easy one, nor\r\ndo I say that we are on the eve of a speedy victory; but what I do say\r\nis that be the struggle long or short, we are both ready to double, to\r\ntreble, to quadruple, and, if necessary, to increase tenfold the\r\noutput of munitions of war.\r\n\r\nWe have pooled our resources, and I, for one, have no doubt, that\r\nthese resources are great enough to stand any strain which we may be\r\ncalled upon to put upon them; nor have I any fear of an ultimate\r\ntriumph. All the great moral forces of the world are on our side. The\r\nAllies are fighting for the freeing of Europe from the domination of\r\nmilitarism; and that is fighting into which every democrat can throw\r\nhimself heart and soul. Defeat in such a cause is unthinkable.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN INDUSTRIALISTS RALLY\r\n\r\n_The Petrograd correspondent of the London Morning Post reported on\r\nJune 11th the annual assembly of leading members of the world of\r\ncommerce and industry, as follows:_\r\n\r\nSpeakers urged a general rally round the Rulers of the States, and\r\nproposals were made that they should express collectively to the\r\nMinisters the readiness of the whole industrial and mercantile class\r\nrepresented at that congress to place themselves at the disposal of\r\nthe State for the purpose of making better provision for the war. The\r\nexample of England in instituting a Ministry of Munitions should serve\r\nas a guide to Russia. A deputation, it was urged, should be appointed\r\nto lay at the feet of the Emperor the heartfelt desire of all to\r\ndevote themselves to the sole purpose of obtaining victory over\r\nGermanism and to expound the ideas of their class for the best means\r\nof employing their resources. England had turned all its manufacturing\r\nresources into factories of munitions of war, and Russia must do the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nSome speakers referred to the lack of capital for the proper\r\nexploitation of the resources of the country, saying that this would\r\nbe especially felt after the war was over. The Congress, however,\r\ndeclined to look beyond the all-important need of the moment, namely,\r\nto direct the entire resources of the country to the achievement of\r\nvictory over Germanism.\r\n\r\nThe final sitting was attended by the President of the Duma, M.\r\nRodzjanko, whose speech was listened to with profound feeling. The\r\nCongress passed with acclamation various patriotic resolutions, its\r\nmain decision being to establish immediately a Central Committee for\r\nthe provision of munitions of war. It is expected that by this means\r\nRussia will be able to accomplish what England is believed to be\r\nachieving in the same direction. Every factory and workshop throughout\r\nthe country is to be organized for the supply of everything needed by\r\nthe armies in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEEDING GERMAN WORKMEN\r\n\r\n_A \"Neutral\" correspondent of The London Daily Chronicle, just\r\nreturned from Germany, was thus quoted in a cable dispatch to_ THE NEW\r\nYORK TIMES _on June 28:_\r\n\r\nIt is in towns, particularly industrial towns, where one sees how\r\nentirely the German nation is organized for war. Into these towns an\r\nenormous number of men have been drafted from the country to work in\r\nfactories, which are humming day and night with activity to keep up\r\nthe supply of all things necessary for the fighting line.\r\n\r\nIn general, the relations between capital and labor there have\r\nexperienced notable amelioration. Indeed, the impression one gains in\r\ntraveling about Germany is one of absolute settled industrial peace,\r\nbut I know this has only been secured because all parties know that\r\nthe first signs of dissatisfaction would be treated \"with the utmost\r\nrigor of the law.\"\r\n\r\nAt some of the largest factories men are often at work fifteen,\r\ntwenty, and even thirty hours on a stretch, with only short intervals\r\nfor rest. Though it is said that there are ample stocks of all kinds\r\nof ammunition, there is noted daily and nightly a feverish haste in\r\nthe factories where it is made.\r\n\r\nThe Government has not officially taken over the factories, but it is\r\nwell known that all factory owners who want Government work can get\r\nit, and, as this is almost the only profitable use to which factories\r\ncan just now be put, there is no lack of candidates for recognition as\r\narmy contractors.\r\n\r\nWhenever a Government contract is given out there is a clause in the\r\ncontract which fixes rates of wages for every grade of workmen so that\r\nany questions of increases that the men might raise are out of the\r\nhands of the employer, and he points to the fact that both he and the\r\nworkmen are in the hands of the State. Strikes are therefore unknown,\r\na further deterrent being the knowledge that any man who does not do\r\nhis utmost without murmuring will quickly be embodied in some regiment\r\ndestined for one of the hottest places at the front.\r\n\r\nIn factories where Government work is being done wages are high, and\r\neven in the few cases where wages of certain unskilled workers have\r\nfallen, the men are allowed to work practically until they drop and so\r\nmake up by more hours what they have lost by the lowered rates.\r\n\r\nThere is keen competition to obtain work in the factories working for\r\nthe State, as the men engaged in these know almost certainly that for\r\nsome time at least they will not be sent to the front, which seems to\r\nbe the chief dread underlying all other thoughts and feelings.\r\n\r\nFor work done on Sunday wages are 50 per cent. higher than the usual\r\nrate. The men are encouraged to work on Sundays and overtime on\r\nweekdays and the prices of food are so high they need little\r\nencouragement. Where women have taken the places of men their wages\r\nare in most cases lower.\r\n\r\n\r\nKRUPPS' IMPENDING STRIKE\r\n\r\n_An Associated Press dispatch from Geneva on July 15 said:_\r\n\r\nA report has reached Basle that a big strike is threatened at the\r\nKrupp Works at Essen, Germany, the movement being headed by the Union\r\nof Metallurgical Workmen and the Association of Mechanics. They demand\r\nhigher wages, the report says, because of the increased cost of living\r\nand shorter hours because of the great strain under which they work.\r\n\r\nThe workmen, according to these advices, are in an angry mood and\r\nthreaten the destruction of machinery unless their demands are granted\r\nimmediately, as they have been put off for three months with promises.\r\nSeveral high officials have arrived at the Krupp Works in an effort to\r\nstraighten out matters and calm the workmen, the advices add, and\r\nBertha Krupp is expected to visit the plant and use her great\r\ninfluence with the workers.\r\n\r\nThe Frankfort Gazette, according to the news reaching Basle, has\r\nwarned the administration of the Krupp plant of the seriousness of the\r\nsituation, and has advised that the men's demands be granted.\r\nMeanwhile, the reports state, several regiments have been moved to the\r\nvicinity of the works to be available should the trouble result in a\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\n_A dispatch to The London Daily Chronicle, dated Chiasso, July 16,\r\nreported:_\r\n\r\nAccording to a telegram from Munich to Swiss papers, the German\r\nmilitary authorities have informed the management and union officials\r\nof the Krupps, where disputes occasioned by the increased cost of\r\nliving have arisen in several departments, that in no circumstances\r\nwill a strike be tolerated.\r\n\r\n_On July 19 an Associated Press dispatch from Geneva reads:_\r\n\r\nAn important meeting was held at Essen yesterday, according to advices\r\nreceived at Basle, between the administration of the Krupp gun works\r\nand representatives of the workmen, in order to settle the dispute\r\nwhich has arisen over the demands of the men for an increase in wages.\r\n\r\nDirectly and indirectly, about one hundred thousand men are involved.\r\nMinor cases in which machinery has been destroyed have been reported.\r\n\r\nThe military authorities before the meeting, the Basle advices say,\r\nwarned both sides that unless an immediate arrangement was reached\r\nsevere measures would be employed.\r\n\r\nThe Krupp officials are understood to have granted a portion of the\r\ndemands of the employees, which has brought about a temporary peace,\r\nbut the workmen still appear to be dissatisfied, and many have left\r\nthe works.\r\n\r\nA strike would greatly affect the supply of munitions, and for this\r\nreason the military have adopted rigorous precautions.\r\n\r\n_On the same date the following brief cable was sent to_ THE NEW YORK\r\nTIMES _from London:_\r\n\r\nA telegram to The Daily Express from Geneva says many men have already\r\nleft the Krupp works because they are unable to bear the strain of\r\nincessant labor, and would rather take their chances in the trenches\r\nthan continue work at Essen under the present conditions.\r\n\r\nSome minor cases of sabotage have already been reported.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINGTON ARMS STRIKE\r\n\r\n_In a special dispatch to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES, _dated Bridgeport,\r\nConn., July 14, appeared the following news of labor trouble in the\r\nAmerican munitions factory:_\r\n\r\nOne hundred workmen, twenty guards, and the Bridgeport police reserves\r\ntook a hand in a riot tonight at the new plant of the Remington Arms\r\nCompany, where it is planned to make small arms for the Allies. The\r\nriot brings to fever heat the labor excitement of the last week, which\r\nyesterday caused the walkout of the structural ironworkers at the\r\nplant and today a walkout of the millwrights and the ironworkers on\r\nthe new plant of the sister company, the Remington Union Metallic\r\nCartridge Company.\r\n\r\nThe three thousand workmen have been stirred into a great unrest in\r\nthe last week by some unseen influence. Major Walter W. Penfield,\r\nU.S.A., retired, head of the arms plant, says pro-Germans are back of\r\nthe strike. This the labor leaders deny.\r\n\r\n_On July 15 the spread of the strike was reported in a special\r\ndispatch from Bridgeport to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES:\r\n\r\nThe strike at the giant new plant of the Remington Arms Company under\r\nconstruction to make arms for the Allies, as well as, it is supposed,\r\nfor the United States Government, spread today from the proportions of\r\na picayune family labor quarrel to an imminent industrial war which\r\nwould paralyze Bridgeport, curtailing the shipment of arms and\r\nammunition from this centre, and which threatens to spread to other\r\ncities in the United States, especially to those where munitions of\r\nwar are being manufactured.\r\n\r\n_On July 20_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _published the demands of the workmen\r\nat the Remington Arms plant, as outlined by J.J. Keppler,\r\nvice-president of the Machinists' Union:_\r\n\r\nMr. Keppler was asked to tell concisely just what the unions wanted.\r\n\r\n\"There are at present,\" he replied, \"just three demands. If the strike\r\ngoes further the demands will increase. The demands are:\r\n\r\n\"1. Recognition of the millwrights as members of the metal trade\r\nunions and not of the carpenters', and fixing of the responsibility\r\nfor the order some one gave for the millwrights to join the\r\ncarpenters' union, an attempt on the part of the Remington or the\r\nStewart people to dictate the international management of the unions.\r\n\r\n\"2. A guarantee of a permanent eight-hour day in all plants in\r\nBridgeport making war munitions. This carries with it a demand for a\r\nguarantee of a minimum wage and double pay for overtime.\r\n\r\n\"3. That all men who go on strike will be taken back to work.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition, of course, Mr. Johnston demands that Major Penfield\r\nretract his charge of German influence being back of the strike.\r\n\r\n_A check, if not a defeat, administered to the fomenters of the strike\r\nwas reported to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _in a Bridgeport dispatch dated\r\nJuly 20, as follows:_\r\n\r\nJohn A. Johnston, International vice-president of the Iron Workers'\r\nUnion, and J.J. Keppler, vice-president of the Machinists', were on\r\nhand to inaugurate the big strike. All of Bridgeport's available\r\npolicemen were on duty at the plant.\r\n\r\nAs the whistle blew the crowd surged about the gates, where barbed\r\nwire and guards held them back. Five minutes passed, ten, twenty, and\r\n12.30 saw Keppler and Johnston pacing up and down before the plant\r\nawaiting their men. At 1 o'clock not a machinist had issued from the\r\nportals. The hoarse whistle blew, calling back the two thousand\r\nworkers to their task, and Keppler and Johnston and the rest were left\r\nin wonder.\r\n\r\nA cog had slipped in this way:\r\n\r\nBefore the noon whistle blew, Major Walter G. Penfield, works manager\r\nof the plant, placed guards at all the exits to ask the machinists to\r\nwait a few minutes. They did. The foreman told them that, on behalf of\r\nthe Remington Company, Major Penfield desired to assure them a\r\npermanent eight-hour day, beginning August 1, and to guarantee a\r\ndollar a day increase in pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Power of the Purse\r\n\r\nHow \"Silver Bullets\" Are Made in Britain\r\n\r\nBy Prime Minister Asquith\r\n\r\n     For the first time in the financial history of Great\r\n     Britain, Prime Minister Asquith declared in his Guildhall\r\n     speech of June 29, an unlimited and democratic war loan was\r\n     popularized, appealing to all classes, including the\r\n     poorest, and advertising the sale through the Post Office of\r\n     vouchers for as low as 5 shillings to be turned into stock.\r\n     His speech was intended also to initiate a movement for\r\n     saving and thrift among the people as the only secure means\r\n     against national impoverishment by the war.\r\n\r\n     A statement by Reginald McKenna, the Chancellor of the\r\n     Exchequer, in the House of Commons on July 13, showed that\r\n     approximately L600,000,000, or $3,000,000,000, had been\r\n     subscribed, making this the greatest war loan raised in the\r\n     history of any nation. The total number of subscribers\r\n     through the Bank of England was 550,000, aggregating\r\n     L570,000,000, or $2,850,000,000, while 547,000 persons had\r\n     subscribed $75,000,000 through the Post Office. Besides this\r\n     no estimate of the small vouchers taken out had been made,\r\n     and the Post Office subscriptions had not been closed. The\r\n     gigantic total, Mr. McKenna said, represented only new\r\n     money, and not any stock which will be issued for purposes\r\n     of conversion. Prime Minister Asquith's speech appears in\r\n     full below.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In his speech in the Guildhall, London, on June 29, 1915, Mr. Asquith\r\nsaid:_\r\n\r\nThis is, I think, the third time since the war began that I have had\r\nthe privilege of addressing you in this hall. On the first occasion,\r\nas far back as September last, I came here to appeal to you to supply\r\nmen to be trained to fight our battles at the front. Today I have come\r\nto ask you here in the City of London for what is equally necessary\r\nfor the success of our cause--for the ways and means which no\r\ncommunity in the Empire is better qualified to provide, to organise,\r\nand to replenish.\r\n\r\nThis is the costliest war that has ever been waged. A hundred years\r\nago our ancestors spent eight hundred millions to vindicate, as we are\r\nvindicating today, the freedom of Europe, in a war which lasted the\r\nbest part of 20 years, which brings out a rough average of\r\nconsiderably less than a million pounds a week. Our total expenditure\r\ntoday approaches for one year a thousand millions, and we are spending\r\nnow, and are likely to spend for weeks and months to come, something\r\nlike three million pounds a day. Our daily revenue from taxation, I\r\nsuppose, works out less than three-quarters of a million per day.\r\n\r\nThose are facts which speak for themselves, and they show the urgent\r\nnecessity, not only for a loan, but for a national loan--a loan far\r\nlarger in its scale, far broader in its basis, and far more imperious\r\nin its demand upon every class and every section of the community than\r\nany in our history.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in our financial experience no limit has been\r\nplaced on the amount to be raised; and that means that every citizen\r\nin the country is invited to subscribe as much as he can to help us to\r\na complete and speedy victory. I need not dwell on its attractiveness\r\nfrom the mere investor's point of view. Indeed, the only criticism\r\nwhich I have heard in or outside the House of Commons is that it is\r\nperhaps a little too generous in its terms. That is a fault, if it be\r\na fault, upon the right side.\r\n\r\nFor L100 in cash you get L100 in stock, with interest at 4-1/2 per\r\ncent. on the credit of the British Exchequer. The loan is redeemable\r\nin thirty years, when every subscriber, or those who succeed him, must\r\nget his money back in full, and the Government retain an option to\r\nrepay at the end of ten years. That is the earliest date on which any\r\nquestion of re-investment can arise. Further, the stock or bonds will\r\nbe accepted at par, with an allowance for accrued interest as the\r\nequivalent of cash, for subscription to any loan that the Government\r\nmay issue in this country throughout the war.\r\n\r\nI want especially to emphasise that this is for the first time in our\r\nfinancial history a great democratic loan. The State is appealing to\r\nall classes, including those whose resources are most limited, to step\r\nin and contribute their share to meet a supreme national need. The\r\nPost Office will receive subscriptions for L5, or any multiple of L5,\r\nand will sell vouchers for 5s. and upwards which can be gradually\r\naccumulated, and by December 1st next turned into stock of the new\r\nloan.\r\n\r\nEvery advantage which is given to the big capitalist is granted also\r\nin the same degree to the smallest supporter of the country's credit\r\nand finance. And, under such conditions, I am confident that the\r\nsuccess of the loan as a financial instrument ought to be, and indeed\r\nis now, absolutely secured. (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nThis meeting was called not only to advertise the advantages of the\r\nWar Loan, but to initiate a concerted national movement for what may\r\nbe called war economy. My text is a very simple one. It is this:\r\n\"Waste on the part either of individuals or of classes, which is\r\nalways foolish and shortsighted, is, in these times, nothing short of\r\na national danger.\" According to statisticians, the annual income of\r\nthis country--I speak of the country and not of the Government--the\r\nannual income of this country is from two thousand two hundred and\r\nfifty to two thousand four hundred millions, and the annual\r\nexpenditure of all classes is estimated at something like two thousand\r\nmillions. It follows that the balance annually saved and invested,\r\neither at home or abroad, is normally between three hundred and four\r\nhundred millions.\r\n\r\nUpon a nation so circumstanced, and with such habits, there has\r\nsuddenly descended--for we did not anticipate it, nor prepared the way\r\nfor it--the thundercloud of war--war which, as we now know well, if we\r\nadd to our own direct expenditure the financing of other countries,\r\nwill cost us in round figures about a thousand millions in the year.\r\nNow how are we, who normally have only three hundred or four hundred\r\nmillions to spare in a year, to meet this huge and unexpected\r\nextraordinary draft upon our resources?\r\n\r\nThe courses open are four. The first is the sale of investments or\r\nproperty. We have, it is said, invested abroad something like four\r\nthousand millions sterling. Can we draw upon that to finance the war?\r\nWell, there are two things to be said about any such suggestion. The\r\nfirst is that our power of sale is limited by the power of other\r\ncountries to buy, and that power, under existing conditions, is\r\nstrictly limited.\r\n\r\nThe second thing to be said is this: That, if we were to try, assuming\r\nit to be practicable, to pay for the war in this way, we should end it\r\nso much poorer. The war must, in any case, impoverish us to some\r\nextent, but we should end it so much poorer, because the income we now\r\nreceive, mainly from goods and services from abroad, would be\r\nproportionately, and permanently, reduced. I dismiss that, therefore,\r\nas out of the question.\r\n\r\nSimilar considerations seem to show the impracticability on any\r\nconsiderable scale of a second possible expedient, namely, borrowing\r\nabroad. The amount that could be raised in any foreign market at this\r\nmoment, in comparison with the sum required, is practically\r\ninfinitesimal, and, if it were possible on any considerable scale, we\r\nshould again have to face the prospects of ending the war a debtor\r\ncountry, with a huge annual drain on our goods and our services, which\r\nwould flow abroad in the payment of interest and the redemption of\r\nprincipal. That again, therefore, for all practical purposes, may be\r\nbrushed aside.\r\n\r\nThere is a third course--payment out of our gold reserve, but that\r\nneed only be stated to be discarded. We cannot impair the basis of the\r\ngreat system of credit which has made this City of London the\r\nfinancial centre and capital of the world.\r\n\r\nThere remains only one course, the one we have come here today to\r\nadvocate, and to press upon our fellow-countrymen--to diminish our\r\nexpenditure and to increase our savings.\r\n\r\nIf you save more you can lend the State more, and the nation will be\r\nproportionately enabled to pay for the war out of its own pocket. A\r\nsecond proposition, equally simple, and equally true, is this. If you\r\nspend less, you either reduce the cost and volume of our imports, or\r\nyou leave a larger volume of commodities available for export.\r\n\r\nThe state of the trade balance between ourselves and other countries\r\nat this moment affords grounds--I do not say for anxiety, but for\r\nserious thought. If you look at the Board of Trade returns for the\r\nfirst five months--that is, to the end of the month of May--of the\r\npresent year--you will find, as compared with the corresponding period\r\nof last year, that our imports have increased by thirty-five and a\r\nhalf millions; while our exports and re-exports have decreased by\r\nseventy-three and three-quarter millions. What does that mean? It\r\nmeans a total addition in five months of our indebtedness to other\r\ncountries of nearly a hundred and ten millions, and if that rate were\r\nto continue till we reached the end of a completed year, the figure of\r\nindebtedness would rise to over two hundred and sixty millions.\r\n\r\nThat is a serious prospect, and I want to ask you, and those outside,\r\nhow can that tendency be counteracted? The answer is a very simple\r\none--by reducing all unnecessary expenditure, first, of imported\r\ngoods--familiar illustrations are tea, tobacco, wine, sugar, petrol; I\r\ncould easily add to the list--and that would mean that we should have\r\nto buy less from abroad; and next, as regards goods which are made at\r\nhome--you can take as an illustration beer--setting a larger quantity\r\nfree for export, which means that we have more to sell abroad, and\r\nenable capital and labour here at home to be more usefully and\r\nappropriately applied. That may seem a rather dry and technical\r\nargument--(laughter)--but it goes to the root of the whole matter.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me to state the result in a sentence, it is this: All money\r\nthat is spent in these days on superfluous comforts or luxuries,\r\nwhether in the shape of goods or in the shape of services, means the\r\ndiversion of energy which can be better employed in the national\r\ninterests, either in supplying the needs of our fighting forces in the\r\nfield or in making commodities for export which will go to reduce our\r\nindebtedness abroad.\r\n\r\nAnd, on the other hand, every saving we make by the curtailment and\r\nlimitation of our productive expenditure increases the resources which\r\ncan be put by our people at the disposal of the State for the\r\ntriumphant vindication of our cause.\r\n\r\nI said our cause. That, after all, is the summary and conclusion of\r\nthe whole matter. We are making here and throughout the Empire a great\r\nnational and Imperial effort, unique, supreme. The recruiting of\r\nsoldiers and sailors, the provision of munitions, the organisation of\r\nour industries, the practice of economy, the avoidance of waste, the\r\naccumulation of adequate war funds, the mobilisation of all our\r\nforces, moral, material, personal--all these are contributory and\r\nconvergent streams which are directed to and concentrated upon one\r\nunifying end, one absorbing and governing purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is not merely with us a question of self-preservation, of\r\nsafeguarding against hostile design and attack the fabric which has\r\nwithstood so many storms of our corporate and national life. That in\r\nitself would justify all our endeavours. But there is something even\r\nlarger and worthier at stake in this great testing trial of our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThere is not a man or a woman among us but he or she is touched even\r\nin the faintest degree with a sense of the higher issues which now\r\nhang in the balance, who has not, during this last year, become\r\ngrowingly conscious that, in the order of Providence, we here have\r\nbeen entrusted with the guardianship of interests and ideals which\r\nstretch far beyond the shores of these islands, beyond even the\r\nconfines of our world-spread Empire, which concern the whole future of\r\nhumanity. (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nIs right or is force to dominate mankind? Comfort, prosperity, luxury,\r\na well-fed and securely sheltered existence, not without the\r\nembellishments and concentrations of art and literature, and perhaps\r\nsome conventional type of religion--all these we can purchase at a\r\nprice, but at what a price! At the sacrifice of what makes life,\r\nnational or personal, alone worth living. My Lord Mayor and citizens\r\nof London, we are not going to make that sacrifice (loud and prolonged\r\ncheers, the audience rising and waving their hats). Rather than make\r\nit, we shall fight to the end, to the last farthing of our money, to\r\nthe last ounce of our strength, to the last drop of our blood.

In explaining\r\n     the bill's intent its introducer, Mr. Walter Long, who is\r\n     President of the Local Government Board, replied on July 9\r\n     to the objection of critics who saw in it the first steps to\r\n     compulsory service. He said that the National Register stood\r\n     or fell by itself. So far as the use of it went, so far as\r\n     the adoption of compulsion went, he declared frankly that\r\n     the Prime Minister would be the last man in England to say,\r\n     in the face of the situation in which Britons found\r\n     themselves, anything which would prevent the Government\r\n     adopting compulsory service tomorrow if they believed it to\r\n     be right and necessary in order to bring this war to an end.\r\n     Their hands were absolutely free. On the same day Earl\r\n     Kitchener opened a recruiting campaign with a speech in the\r\n     London Guildhall, which appears in part below.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lord Mayor of London, in calling upon Lord Kitchener, said the\r\nEmpire had indeed been highly fortunate in having him at the head of\r\nthe War Office in this great national crisis. Earl Kitchener was\r\nreceived with cheers as he said:_\r\n\r\nHitherto the remarks that I have found it necessary to make on the\r\nsubject of recruiting have been mainly addressed to the House of\r\nLords; but I have felt that the time had now come when I may with\r\nadvantage avail myself of the courteous invitation of the Lord Mayor\r\nto appear among you, and in this historic Guildhall make another and a\r\nlarger demand on the resources of British manhood. Enjoying as I do\r\nthe privilege of a Freeman of this great City--(hear, hear!)--I can be\r\nsure that words uttered in the heart of London will be spread\r\nbroadcast throughout the Empire. (Cheers.) Our thoughts naturally turn\r\nto the splendid efforts of the Oversea Dominions and India, who, from\r\nthe earliest days of the war, have ranged themselves side by side\r\nwith the Mother Country. The prepared armed forces of India were the\r\nfirst to take the field, closely followed by the gallant\r\nCanadians--(cheers)--who are now fighting alongside their British and\r\nFrench comrades in Flanders, and are there presenting a solid and\r\nimpenetrable front against the enemy. In the Dardanelles the\r\nAustralians and New Zealanders--(cheers)--combined with the same\r\nelements, have already accomplished a feat of arms of almost\r\nunexampled brilliancy, and are pushing the campaign to a successful\r\nconclusion. In each of these great Dominions new and large contingents\r\nare being prepared, while South Africa, not content with the\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the arduous campaign in South-West Africa, is\r\nnow offering large forces to engage the enemy in the main theatre of\r\nwar. (Cheers.) Strengthened by the unflinching support of our\r\nfellow-citizens across the seas, we seek to develop our own military\r\nresources to their utmost limits, and this is the purpose which brings\r\nus together today.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, when asked what were the three things necessary for a\r\nsuccessful war, replied: \"Money, money, money.\" Today we vary that\r\nphrase, and say: \"Men, material, and money.\" As regards the supply of\r\nmoney for the war, the Government are negotiating a new loan, the\r\nmarked success of which is greatly due to the very favorable response\r\nmade by the City. To meet the need for material, the energetic manner\r\nin which the new Ministry of Munitions is coping with the many\r\ndifficulties which confront the production of our great requirements\r\naffords abundant proof that this very important work is being dealt\r\nwith in a highly satisfactory manner. (Cheers.) There still remains\r\nthe vital need for men to fill the ranks of our Armies, and it is to\r\nemphasize this point and bring it home to the people of this country\r\nthat I have come here this afternoon. When I took up the office that I\r\nhold, I did so as a soldier, not as a politician--(loud cheers)--and I\r\nwarned my fellow countrymen that the war would be not only arduous,\r\nbut long. (Hear, hear.) In one of my earliest statements made after\r\nthe beginning of the war I said that I should require \"More men, and\r\nstill more, until the enemy is crushed.\" I repeat that statement today\r\nwith even greater insistence. All the reasons which led me to think in\r\nAugust, 1914, that this war would be a prolonged one hold good at the\r\npresent time. It is true we are in an immeasurably better situation\r\nnow than ten months ago--(hear, hear)--but the position today is at\r\nleast as serious as it was then. The thorough preparedness of Germany,\r\ndue to her strenuous efforts, sustained at high pressure for some\r\nforty years, have issued in a military organization as complex in\r\ncharacter as it is perfect in machinery. Never before has any nation\r\nbeen so elaborately organized for imposing her will upon the other\r\nnations of the world; and her vast resources of military strength are\r\nwielded by an autocracy which is peculiarly adapted for the conduct of\r\nwar. It is true that Germany's long preparation has enabled her to\r\nutilize her whole resources from the very commencement of the war,\r\nwhile our policy is one of gradually increasing our effective forces.\r\nIt might be said with truth that she must decrease, whilst we must\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to exaggerate the value of the response that has\r\nbeen made to my previous appeals, but I am here today to make another\r\ndemand on the manhood of the country to come forward to its defence. I\r\nwas from the first unwilling to ask for a supply of men in excess of\r\nthe equipment available for them. I hold it to be most undesirable\r\nthat soldiers, keen to take their place in the field, should be thus\r\nchecked and possibly discouraged, or that the completion of this\r\ntraining should be hampered owing to lack of arms. We have now happily\r\nreached a period when it can be said that this drawback has been\r\nsurmounted, and that the troops in training can be supplied with\r\nsufficient arms and material to turn them out as efficient soldiers.\r\n\r\nWhen the great rush of recruiting occurred in August and September of\r\nlast year, there was a natural difficulty in finding accommodation for\r\nthe many thousands who answered to the call for men to complete the\r\nexisting armed forces and the New Armies. Now, however, I am glad to\r\nsay we have throughout the country provided accommodation calculated\r\nto be sufficient and suitable for our requirements. Further, there was\r\nin the early autumn a very natural difficulty in clothing and\r\nequipping the newly raised units. Now we are able to clothe and equip\r\nall recruits as they come in, and thus the call for men is no longer\r\nrestricted by any limitations, such as the lack of material for\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nIt is an axiom that the larger an army is, the greater is its need of\r\nan ever-swelling number of men of recruitable age to maintain it at\r\nits full strength; yet, at the very same time the supply of those very\r\nmen is automatically decreasing. Nor must it be forgotten that the\r\ngreat demand which has arisen for the supply of munitions, equipment,\r\netc., for the armed forces of this country and of our Allies also, as\r\nwell as the economic and financial necessity of keeping up the\r\nproduction of manufactured goods, involves the retention of a large\r\nnumber of men in various trades and manufactures, many of whom would\r\notherwise be available for the Colors. In respect of our great and\r\nincreasing military requirements for men, I am glad to state how much\r\nwe are indebted to the help given to the Recruiting Staff of the\r\nRegular Army and to the Territorial Associations throughout the\r\ncountry by the many Voluntary Recruiting Committees formed in all the\r\ncounties and cities, and in many important boroughs for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe public has watched with eager interest the growth and the rapidly\r\nacquired efficiency of the New Armies, whose dimensions have already\r\nreached a figure which only a short while ago would have been\r\nconsidered utterly unthinkable. (Cheers.) But there is a tendency,\r\nperhaps, to overlook the fact that these larger armies require still\r\nlarger reserves, to make good the wastage at the front. And one cannot\r\nignore the certainty that our requirements in this respect will be\r\nlarge, continuous, and persistent; for one feels that our gallant\r\nsoldiers in the fighting line are beckoning, with an urgency at once\r\nimperious and pathetic, to those who remain at home to come out and\r\nplay their part too. Recruiting meetings, recruiting marches, and the\r\nunwearied labors of the recruiting officers, committees, and\r\nindividuals have borne good fruit, and I look forward with confidence\r\nto such labors being continued as energetically as hitherto.\r\n\r\nBut we must go a step further, so as to attract and attach individuals\r\nwho from shyness--(laughter)--or other causes--(renewed\r\nlaughter)--have not yet yielded to their own patriotic impulses. The\r\nGovernment have asked Parliament to pass a Registration Bill, with the\r\nobject of ascertaining how many men and women there are in the country\r\nbetween the ages of fifteen and sixty-five eligible for the national\r\nservice, whether in the navy or army, or for the manufacture of\r\nmunitions, or to fulfil other necessary services. When this\r\nregistration is completed we shall anyhow be able to note the men\r\nbetween the ages of nineteen and forty not required for munition or\r\nother necessary industrial work and therefore available, if physically\r\nfit, for the fighting line. Steps will be taken to approach, with a\r\nview to enlistment, all possible candidates for the Army--unmarried\r\nmen to be preferred before married men, as far as may be. (Loud\r\ncheers.) Of course, the work of completing the registration will\r\nextend over some weeks, and meanwhile it is of vital and paramount\r\nimportance that as large a number of men as possible should press\r\nforward to enlist, so that the men's training may be complete when\r\nthey are required for the field. I would urge all employers to help\r\nin this matter, by releasing all men qualified for service with the\r\nColors and replacing them by men of unrecruitable age, or by women, as\r\nhas already been found feasible in so many cases.\r\n\r\nWhen the registration becomes operative I feel sure that the\r\nCorporation of the City of London will not be content with its earlier\r\nefforts, intensely valuable as they have been, but will use its great\r\nfacilities to set an example of canvassing for the cause. This canvass\r\nshould be addressed with stern emphasis to such unpatriotic employers\r\nas, according to returns, have restrained their men from enlisting.\r\n\r\nWhat the numbers required are likely to be it is clearly inexpedient\r\nto shout abroad. (Hear, hear.) Our constant refusal to publish either\r\nthese or any other figures likely to prove useful to the enemy needs\r\nneither explanation nor apology. It is often urged that if more\r\ninformation were given as to the work and whereabouts of various\r\nunits, recruiting would be strongly stimulated. But this is the\r\nprecise information which would be of the greatest value to the enemy,\r\nand it is agreeable to note that a German Prince in high command\r\nruefully recorded the other day his complete ignorance as to our New\r\nArmies. (Laughter and cheers.)\r\n\r\nBut one set of figures, available for everybody, and indicating with\r\nsufficient particularity the needs of our forces in the field, is\r\nsupplied by the casualty lists. With regard to these lists,\r\nhowever--serious and sad as they necessarily are--let two points be\r\nborne in mind, first, that a very large percentage of the casualties\r\nrepresents comparatively slight hurts, the sufferers from which in\r\ntime return to the front; and, secondly, that, if the figures seem to\r\nrun very high, the magnitude of the operations is thereby suggested.\r\nIndeed, these casualty lists, whose great length may now and again\r\ninduce undue depression of spirits, are an instructive indication of\r\nthe huge extent of the operations undertaken now reached by the\r\nBritish forces in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican War Supplies\r\n\r\nBy George Wellington Porter\r\n\r\n     The subjoined article appraising the stimulation given to\r\n     the war industries of the United States by the European\r\n     conflict appeared originally in THE NEW YORK TIMES of July\r\n     18.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the last ten months contracts for war supplies estimated to\r\nexceed $1,000,000,000 have been placed in the United States.\r\n\r\nWhen war was declared last August this country was suffering from\r\nacute industrial depression; many factories shut down, others\r\noperating on short time, and labor without employment. After the\r\nparalyzing effect of the news that war was declared had worn away,\r\nbusiness men here realized the great opportunity about to be afforded\r\nthem of furnishing war supplies which must soon be in demand. Their\r\nexpectations were soon fulfilled, as almost immediately most of the\r\nGovernments sent commissions to the United States. Some had orders to\r\nbuy, while others were authorized to get prices and submit samples.\r\n\r\nIt was not long until mills and factories were being operated to\r\ncapacity, turning out boots and shoes, blankets, sweaters, socks,\r\nunderwear, &c. The manufacturers of these articles were merely\r\nrequired to secure additional help in order to increase their plants'\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThe situation was different in relation to filling orders for arms and\r\nammunition. At first, as was natural, this business was placed with\r\nconcerns engaged in the manufacture of these commodities. Shortly they\r\nwere swamped with orders, and to be able to fill them plants were\r\nenlarged, new equipment added, and additional help employed.\r\n\r\nMore and more orders came pouring in, and, as the arms and munition\r\nhouses were by this time up to and some over capacity, acceptance by\r\nthem of further business was impossible. Here, then, was the\r\nopportunity for the manufacturers of rails, rivets, electrical and\r\nagricultural machinery, locomotives, &c., to secure their share of\r\nthis enormous business being offered. The manner in which they arose\r\nto the occasion is striking testimony of the great resourcefulness,\r\nefficiency, ingenuity, and adaptability of the American manufacturer.\r\n\r\nThe question of labor was of minor importance, due primarily to the\r\nfact that many thousands of men were without employment and anxious to\r\nsecure work, and secondarily for the reason that skilled labor was not\r\nan essential factor. Most of the work is done by machinery and in a\r\nshort period of time a mechanic of ordinary intelligence will become\r\nproficient in running a machine. The necessary trained labor could be\r\nsecured without difficulty. Numbers of highly trained employes at\r\nGovernment arsenals are now with private arms and ammunition concerns.\r\nThe labor problem therefore was negligible. However, three serious\r\ndifficulties had yet to be overcome by the manufacturers wishing to\r\nengage in this new line of business--the securing of new machinery,\r\nraw materials, and capital.\r\n\r\nThe larger concerns had machinery and apparatus on hand suitable to\r\nmost of the work, but much new machinery was needed, especially for\r\nthe manufacture of rifles, and needed in a hurry. Time is the essence\r\nof these war supplies contracts, and, as many manufacturers agreed to\r\nmake early deliveries, it was up to them to secure this new machinery\r\nand have it installed without delay; otherwise they could not\r\nmanufacture and make deliveries as agreed to.\r\n\r\nIn this event they would suffer the penalty for non-fulfillment, as\r\nstipulated in the bond given by them to the purchaser at the time of\r\nsigning the contract. These bonds are known as \"fulfillment bonds\"\r\nand are issued by responsible surety companies, usually to the amount\r\nof 5 per cent. of the total contract price, on behalf of the vendors,\r\nguaranteeing their deliveries and fulfillment of the contract.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier stages of this war supply business the question of his\r\nability to secure raw materials with which to manufacture arms and\r\nammunition or picric acid--this latter being used to manufacture\r\nhigher explosives--was of no great concern to the manufacturer taking\r\nan order; but as orders came pouring in from abroad for ever larger\r\namounts of supplies it was clearly evident that the demand for raw\r\nmaterials would shortly equal, if not exceed, the supply thereof. This\r\ncondition was soon brought about, and today is one to be most\r\nseriously reckoned with by the manufacturer before accepting a\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nSome of the materials needed with which to manufacture the supplies\r\nare mild carbon steel for the barrels, bayonets, bolt, and locks;\r\nwell-seasoned ash or maple, straight-grained, for the stocks; brass,\r\niron, powder, antimony, benzol or phenol, sulphuric acid, nitric acid,\r\nand caustic soda, &c. Of these various materials the most difficult to\r\nsecure are those used in the manufacture of picric acid.\r\n\r\nToday it is almost impossible to secure phenol, certainly in any\r\nconsiderable quantities, and it is almost as difficult to secure\r\nsulphuric acid and nitric acid. Germany has been the source of supply\r\nin the past for picric acid. Before the war it sold around 35 cents to\r\n40 cents per pound, dry basis; recently it has sold at over $2 per\r\npound for spot, that is immediate delivery, and is quoted at from\r\n$1.25 to $1.60 per pound for early future deliveries.\r\n\r\nAntimony is becoming so scarce, never having been produced in any\r\ngreat quantity in this country, that in the new contracts being\r\nsubmitted for shrapnel shell it is stipulated that some other\r\nhardening ingredients may be substituted in the bullets, either\r\ntotally or partly replacing the antimony.\r\n\r\nBrass is essential to the manufacture of cartridges. The term \"brass\"\r\nis commonly understood to mean an alloy of copper and zinc.\r\n\r\nUp to a short time ago electrolytic copper was selling at 20-1/2 cents\r\na pound, lead at 7 cents a pound, commercial zinc at 29-1/2 cents a\r\npound. Zinc ore, from which spelter is obtained, reached the price of\r\n$112 a ton. American spelter was nearly $500 a ton, compared with $110\r\na ton before the war. Spelter was almost unobtainable. In England the\r\nsituation was acute, the metal there being quoted only nominally at\r\naround $550 a ton for immediate delivery.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few days prices have dropped materially, but how long\r\nthey will remain at these lower levels it is impossible to predict. If\r\nthe war continues for any length of time the demand for all these\r\nmetals is certainly bound to increase, and this will automatically\r\nagain send up prices.\r\n\r\nThe world's production of spelter in 1913 (the latest authentic\r\nfigures obtainable) was 1,093,635 short tons. Of this the United\r\nStates produced 346,676 tons, or 31.7 per cent.; Germany, 312,075\r\ntons, or 28.6 per cent.; Belgium, 217,928 tons, or 19.9 per cent.;\r\nFrance and Spain, 78,289 tons; and Great Britain, 65,197 tons. The\r\nworld's production of spelter in 1913 exceeded that of 1912 by 25,590\r\ntons, or 2.2 per cent. The greatest increase was contributed by\r\nGermany, which exceeded its production of 1912 by 4.4 per cent. The\r\nUnited States made a gain of 2.3 per cent. The excess of the world's\r\nproduction over consumption in 1913 was only 27,316 tons.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen from the above figures, Germany has control of\r\npractically one-half, possibly now over one-half, of the world's\r\nproduction of spelter. Her position with respect to iron and coal is\r\nequally strong, the United States not included. In 1913 Germany's\r\nproduction of pig iron was 19,000 tons; Great Britain, 10,500 tons;\r\nFrance, 5,225 tons; Russia, 4,475 tons; Austria and Belgium, over\r\n2,000 tons each; Italy, negligible. She has captured a large\r\nproportion of the coal resources of France as well. Her strength is\r\nher own plus that of conquered territory.\r\n\r\nBefore a contract for war supplies is let, more particularly with\r\nreference to contracts for arms and ammunition, the manufacturer is\r\nrequested to \"qualify.\" This means he must show his ability to \"make\r\ngood\" on the contract he wishes to secure. If he is now or has been in\r\nthe past successfully engaged in the manufacture of the particular\r\narticle in question, this is usually sufficient; if it is out of his\r\nregular line, then he must prove to the satisfaction of the War\r\nDepartment or the purchasing agent, as the case may be, that he has\r\nthe technical knowledge necessary for its production. In either event\r\nhe must have an efficient organization, suitable plants, with proper\r\nequipment and men to operate same; also the necessary raw materials in\r\nhand or under option to purchase.\r\n\r\nIn most instances the manufacturer taking these war orders has been\r\nobliged to enlarge his plants, add new machinery and purchase raw\r\nmaterials so as to be able to handle the business. This meant the\r\nexpenditure of large amounts of money on his part.\r\n\r\nHe did not have to depend, however, upon his own normal financial\r\nresources, as the contracts carry a substantial cash payment in\r\nadvance, usually 25 per cent. of the total contract price. This\r\nadvance payment is deposited in some New York bank simultaneously with\r\nthe manufacturer's depositing a surety bond guaranteeing his\r\ndeliveries, and upon the manufacturer executing an additional surety\r\nbond guaranteeing his responsibility he could draw down all or any\r\npart of the cash advance he might wish to use for his immediate needs.\r\n\r\nBefore issuing these bonds the surety companies make rigid examination\r\nas to the ability of the manufacturer to fulfill his contract. The\r\ncommission charged for issuing these bonds is from 2-1/2 to 5 per\r\ncent. on the amount involved. The demand for bonds has been so great\r\nduring the last six months that it has taxed to the limit the combined\r\nresources of all the surety companies in the country.\r\n\r\nThe remaining part of the contract price is usually guaranteed by\r\nbankers' irrevocable letters of credit or deposits made with New York\r\nbanks, to be drawn against as the goods are delivered, f.o.b. the\r\nfactory--that is, free on board the cars--or f.a.s. the seaboard--that\r\nis, free alongside ship--as the terms may provide.\r\n\r\nBanks here are beginning to purchase bank acceptances or bank-accepted\r\nbills of exchange, and in this manner payment is also being made to\r\nAmerican manufacturers for goods sold to the Allies. For example, when\r\na purchasing agent in Paris places an order for ammunition here he\r\nmakes arrangements whereby the manufacturer will be authorized to draw\r\non a New York banking institution at a stipulated maturity, and after\r\nacceptance of his drafts by such banking institution he could then\r\nnegotiate these time drafts with his own banker--thus making them,\r\nless the discount, equivalent to cash--through whom they could be\r\nrediscounted by the Federal Reserve banks. These bank-accepted bills\r\nare discounted at a nominal rate of interest.\r\n\r\nBefore the war we were a debtor nation; today we are rapidly becoming,\r\nif we have not already become, a creditor nation. A year ago we were\r\nselling abroad only about as much goods as we were buying; now the\r\nbalance of trade is greatly in our favor, due to the enormous export\r\nof foodstuffs and war supplies of all kinds. Monthly our exports are\r\nexceeding our imports by many millions of dollars. This indicates that\r\nforeign nations are going into debt to us.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing this article foreign exchange was quoted as\r\nfollows: London exchange, sterling, 4.76-1/2; Paris exchange, franc,\r\n5.45-3/4. By paying down $4.76-1/2 in New York you can get L1 in\r\nLondon, which on a par gold basis is equivalent to $4.86 in London. By\r\npaying down 94-1/2 cents in New York you can get the equivalent to 100\r\ncents in Paris.\r\n\r\nWe now come to another interesting phase of this war supply business,\r\nnamely, how some persons thought these war orders could be secured and\r\nhow they are actually being placed. Almost immediately after the\r\ndeclaration of war, most of the belligerent Governments dispatched\r\n\"commissions\" to the United States. Some had orders to buy, and\r\nothers were authorized to get prices and submit samples. In an\r\nincredibly short period of time it became generally known that foreign\r\nGovernments were shopping and buying in our markets. The knowledge of\r\nthis fact brought about a condition unique in our business life.\r\n\r\nMen in all walks of life, from porters, barbers, clerks in offices, to\r\ndoctors, lawyers, real estate agents, merchants, Wall Street brokers\r\nand bankers, seemed suddenly imbued with the idea of securing or\r\nbringing about the placing of a war order. Self-appointed agents,\r\nmiddlemen and brokers sprang up over night like mushrooms, each and\r\nevery one claiming he had an order or could get an order for war\r\nsupplies; or, as the case might be, he personally knew some\r\nmanufacturer, or he knew a friend who had a friend who knew a\r\nmanufacturer, who in turn wished to secure a contract. An official in\r\none of our large steel companies told me some weeks ago that among\r\nothers who had called at his company's offices, asking prices on\r\nshrapnel, was an undertaker.\r\n\r\nIn most instances the lack of salesmanship experience, to say nothing\r\nof any knowledge of the business and how the particular articles are\r\nmanufactured, was of no consequence to the self-appointed agent in his\r\nmad desire for business.\r\n\r\nThe lobbies of our New York hotels were filled with horsemen and\r\nwould-be horsemen, some months ago, almost every State being\r\nrepresented as far west as California; also with manufacturers and\r\nmanufacturers' agents, all eager to secure a \"war contract,\" be it for\r\nhorses, shrapnel, rifles, picric acid, guncotton, toluol, cartridges,\r\nboots, shoes, sweaters, blankets, machinery and materials, &c. The\r\nvery atmosphere of Manhattan Island seems impregnated with \"war\r\ncontractitis.\" We breathe it, we think it, we see it, we talk it, on\r\nour way downtown, at our offices and places of business, at our clubs,\r\non our way home at night, in our homes, and I have been told that some\r\nhave even slept it, the disease taking the shape of a nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe day of the broker, if indeed he ever had one in this business, is\r\npassed. The original commissioners have been withdrawn, or those who\r\nhave been kept here are now acting as inspectors and have been\r\nreplaced by purchasing agents. The firm of J.P. Morgan & Co. has been\r\nacting as purchasing agent for the English Government for some months\r\npast, is now acting in like capacity for the French Government, and\r\nhas also done considerable buying for the Russian Government.\r\n\r\nIn order properly to handle this vast volume of business, a separate\r\ndepartment was created, known as the Export Department. Connected with\r\nthis department are experts in all lines--men who are thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the various Governments' requirements, who know what\r\nprices should be paid, who are in close touch with each market, and\r\nwho understand fully the materials they are buying.\r\n\r\nThere are a few more concerns, among which are one or two banks, trust\r\ncompanies, and Wall Street houses, which also have formed separate\r\norganizations for the purpose of purchasing war supplies for the\r\nAllies. As all these concerns are in close touch with the\r\nmanufacturers and will only deal directly with them, the brokers and\r\nmiddlemen have very little, if any, chance of doing business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMagazinists of the World on the War\r\n\r\nCondensed from the Leading Reviews\r\n\r\n     While the armies and generals of the belligerents are trying\r\n     to execute by force the policies of their respective\r\n     Governments, their publicists are not less busy in the work\r\n     of voicing the national aspirations. Moreover, such a\r\n     critical examination of the status of each armed Power, from\r\n     its own standpoint and in comparisons and contrasts with its\r\n     opponents, has never been conducted before the peoples of\r\n     the world. It is a time of national heart-searchings, both\r\n     among the warring nations and of neutrals whose destinies\r\n     are only less affected. Resumes of this great process as\r\n     reflected in the world's leading reviews appear below,\r\n     beginning with the British publications.\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany's Long-Nourished Powers\r\n\r\nThat Germany has been preparing forty years for this war is flatly\r\ncontradicted by J. Ellis Barker in his article entitled \"The Secret of\r\nGermany's Strength,\" appearing in the Nineteenth Century and After for\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nNot forty years, but for 260 years, since Frederick William, the Great\r\nElector, came to the Prussian throne, the slow-growing plants of\r\nGerman efficiency and thoroughness have steadily unfolded, Mr. Barker\r\nsays, in the administrative, military, financial, and economic policy\r\nthat make modern Germany. It was the Great Elector who \"ruthlessly and\r\ntyrannously suppressed existing self-government in his possessions,\r\nand gave to his scattered and parochially minded subjects a strong\r\nsense of unity,\" thus clearing the way for his successors. Frederick\r\nWilliam I. founded in the Prussia prepared by his grandfather \"a\r\nperfectly organized modern State, a model administration, and created\r\na perfectly equipped and ever ready army.\" Of him Mr. Barker says:\r\n\r\n     The German people are often praised for their thoroughness,\r\n     industry, frugality, and thrift. These qualities are not\r\n     natural to them. They received them from their rulers, and\r\n     especially from Frederick William the First. He was an\r\n     example to his people, and his son carried on the paternal\r\n     tradition. Both Kings acted not only with thoroughness,\r\n     industry, frugality, and economy, but they enforced these\r\n     qualities upon their subjects. Both punished idlers of every\r\n     rank of society, even of the most exalted. The regime of\r\n     Thorough prevailed under these Kings who ruled during\r\n     seventy-three years. These seventy-three years of hard\r\n     training gave to the Prussian people those sterling\r\n     qualities which are particularly their own, and by which\r\n     they can easily be distinguished from the easy-going South\r\n     Germans and Austrians who have not similarly been\r\n     disciplined.\r\n\r\nWhile the Great Elector prepared the ground, and King Frederick\r\nWilliam I. firmly laid the foundations, \"Frederick the Great erected\r\nthereon the edifice of modern Germany.\" Mr. Barker adds:\r\n\r\n     Among the many pupils of Frederick the Great was Bismarck.\r\n     It is no exaggeration to say that the writings which\r\n     Frederick the Great addressed to posterity are the _arcana\r\n     imperii_ of modern Germany. Those who desire to learn the\r\n     secret of Germany's strength, wealth, and efficiency, should\r\n     therefore most carefully study the teachings of Frederick\r\n     the Great.\r\n\r\n     Frederick's \"Political Testament\" of 1752 addressed to his\r\n     successors begins with the significant words:\r\n\r\n     \"The first duty of a citizen consists in serving his\r\n     country. I have tried to fulfil that duty in all the\r\n     different phases of my life.\"\r\n\r\nFrederick William I. looked out for the education of his successors in\r\nhis own militarist ideals. Instructing Major Borcke in 1751 on the\r\ntutoring of his grand-nephew, the Heir-Presumptive of Prussia, he\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     It is very important that he should love the Army. Therefore\r\n     he must be told at all occasions and by all whom he meets\r\n     that men of birth who are not soldiers are pitiful wretches.\r\n     He must be taken to see the troops drilling as often as he\r\n     likes. He ought to be shown the Cadets, and be given five or\r\n     six of them to drill. That should be an amusement for him,\r\n     not a duty. The great point is that he should become fond of\r\n     military affairs, and the worst that could happen would be\r\n     if he should become bored with them. He should be allowed to\r\n     talk to all, to cadets, soldiers, citizens and officers, to\r\n     increase his self-reliance.\r\n\r\nA thorough monarchist, who noted that \"when Sweden was turned into a\r\nrepublic it became weak,\" Frederick the Great preached a doctrine not\r\ndifferent from that which inspires the speeches of Kaiser Wilhelm II.\r\nwhen he said in his \"Political Testament\" of 1752:\r\n\r\n     As Prussia is surrounded by powerful states my successors\r\n     must be prepared for frequent wars. The soldiers must be\r\n     given the highest positions in Prussia for the same reason\r\n     for which they received them in ancient Rome when that State\r\n     conquered the world. Honors and rewards stimulate and\r\n     encourage talent and praise arouses men to a generous\r\n     emulation. It encourages men to enter the army. It is\r\n     paradoxical to treat officers contemptuously and call theirs\r\n     an honored profession. The men who are the principal\r\n     supports of the State must be encouraged and be preferred to\r\n     the soft and insipid society men who can only grace an\r\n     ante-chamber.\r\n\r\nMr. Barker comments on the fact that in 1776, thirteen years after the\r\nruinous Seven Years' War, Frederick the Great had accumulated\r\nfinancial resources sufficient to pay for another war lasting four\r\nyears, and that he pursued the food policy of his fathers \"which is\r\nstill pursued by the Prusso-German Government.\" Moreover, he first\r\nexalted the German professor:\r\n\r\n     A hundred and fifty years ago Prussia was a land peopled by\r\n     boors. Now it is a land peopled by professors, scientists,\r\n     and artists. Frederick the Great was the first Prussian\r\n     monarch to realize that science and art increase the\r\n     strength and prestige of nations. Hence, he began\r\n     cultivating the sciences and arts, and his successors\r\n     followed his example. As science and art were found to be\r\n     sources of national power, they were as thoroughly promoted\r\n     as was the army itself, while in this country [England]\r\n     education remained amateurish. Men toyed with science and\r\n     the universities rather taught manners than efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe lesson of this centuries-old efficient governmental machine is a\r\nsupreme one to democratic England, Mr. Barker thinks. Not that it is\r\nhopeless for a democracy to compete with a highly organized monarchy,\r\nfor has not Switzerland shown that \"a democracy may be efficient,\r\nbusiness-like, provident, and ready for war?\" England, on the other\r\nhand, has been a lover of luxury and ease. She must gird up her loins\r\nand fight or die. The Anglo-Saxon race is fighting for its existence,\r\nand delay is dangerous:\r\n\r\n     War is a one-man business. Every other consideration must be\r\n     subordinated to that of achieving victory. When the United\r\n     States fought for their life, they made President Lincoln\r\n     virtually a Dictator. The freest and most unruly democracy\r\n     allowed Habeas Corpus to be suspended and conscription to be\r\n     introduced, to save itself. Great emergencies call for great\r\n     measures. The War demands great sacrifices in every\r\n     direction. However, if it leads to England's modernization,\r\n     to the elimination of the weaknesses and vices of\r\n     Anglo-Saxon democracy, if it leads to the unification and\r\n     organization of the Empire, the purification of its\r\n     institutions, and the recreation of the race, the gain may\r\n     be greater than the loss, the colossal cost of the War\r\n     notwithstanding. The British Empire and the United States,\r\n     the Anglo-Saxon race in both hemispheres, have arrived at\r\n     the turning point in their history. The next few months will\r\n     confirm their greatness or mark the beginning of their fatal\r\n     decline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To Avenge\"\r\n\r\nStern is the denunciation of W.S. Lilly, in the same issue of The\r\nNineteenth Century and After, upon the atrocities recounted in an\r\narticle on German atrocities in France by Professor Morgan, appearing\r\nin the next preceding number. Mr. Lilly quotes Thomas Carlyle's\r\nsarcastic words about the \"blind loquacious prurience of\r\nindiscriminate Philanthropism\" that commands no revenge for great\r\ninjustice. He says:\r\n\r\n     Apart from the \"fierce and monstrous gladness,\" with which\r\n     the German people have welcomed the hellish cruelty of their\r\n     soldiery, they must be held responsible for its crimes.\r\n     General von Bernhardi, indeed, assures them that \"political\r\n     morality differs from individual morality because there is\r\n     no power above the State.\" And they have been given over to\r\n     a strong delusion to believe this lie. Above the State is\r\n     the Eternal Rule of Right and Wrong: above the State is the\r\n     Supreme Moral Governor of the Universe; yes, above the State\r\n     is God. Let us proclaim this august verity though in France\r\n     Atheism has been triumphant; in England Agnosticism is\r\n     fashionable; in Lutheran Germany--worst of all--evil has\r\n     been enthroned in the place of good, and \"devils to adore\r\n     for deities\" is the proper cult.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the old Roman patriot that \"Carthage must be\r\ndestroyed\" is quoted by this writer. He adds:\r\n\r\n     As stern a resolution is in the minds and on the lips of all\r\n     true lovers of their country and of mankind, be they English\r\n     or French, Russian, Italian, Japanese, and I do not hesitate\r\n     to add American. German militarism must be utterly destroyed\r\n     and the monstrous creation of blood and iron overthrown.\r\n     Such is the plainest dictate of the instinct of\r\n     self-preservation. It is also the plainest dictate of\r\n     justice. Germany must be paid that she has deserved. When\r\n     the triumphant Allies shall have made good their footing on\r\n     her soil, they will not indeed rival her exploits or\r\n     violating women and butchering children, of murdering\r\n     prisoners and wounded, of slaying unoffending and peaceful\r\n     peasants, of destroying shrines of religion and learning.\r\n     But they will assuredly shoot or hang such of the chief\r\n     perpetrators of these and the like atrocities as may fall\r\n     into their hands. They will strip her of ill-gained\r\n     territory. They will empty her arsenals and burn her war\r\n     workshops. They will impose a colossal indemnity which will\r\n     condemn her for long years to grinding poverty. They will\r\n     confiscate her fleet. They will remove the treasures of her\r\n     galleries and museums, and take toll of her libraries, to\r\n     make compensation for her pillage and incendiarism in\r\n     Belgium. The measure of punishment is always a matter of\r\n     difficulty. But surely anything less than this would be\r\n     wholly disproportionate to the rank offences of Germany. The\r\n     reckoning, the retribution, the retaliation to be just must\r\n     be most stern. The victorious Allies, who will be her\r\n     judges, will not be moved by \"mealymouthed philanthropies.\"\r\n     \"Justice shall strike and Mercy shall not hold her hands:\r\n     she shall strike sore strokes, and Pity shall not break the\r\n     blow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pope, the Vatican, and Italy\r\n\r\nIn The Fortnightly Review for July E.J. Dillon is sweeping in his\r\narraignment of the new Pope Benedict XV. and the Vatican, of the Pope\r\nbecause of his \"neutrality in matters of public morality,\" and of the\r\nVatican because of its hostility to the cause of Allies. Toward\r\nmartyred Belgium and suffering France the Pope \"has been generous in\r\nlip sympathy and promises of rewards in the life to come,\" Mr. Dillon\r\nsays; but he has \"found no word of blame for their executioners.\" Mr.\r\nDillon personally offered Benedict XV. \"some important information on\r\nthe subject which seemed adequate to change his views or modify his\r\naction,\" but he \"turned the conversation to other topics.\" In fairness\r\nhe adds that \"personally Benedict XV. had been careful to keep aloof\r\nfrom Buelow and his band,\" and has neither said nor done anything\r\nblameworthy with the sole exception of the interview and message which\r\nhe was reported to have given \"to an American-German champion of\r\nmilitarism at the instigation of his intimate counsellor, Monsignor\r\nGerlach\"--an interview, by the way, which the Pope has since expressly\r\nrepudiated.\r\n\r\nMonsignor Gerlach, Mr. Dillon says, is \"one of the most compromising\r\nassociates and dangerous mentors that any sovereign ever admitted to\r\nhis privacy,\" and continues:\r\n\r\n     Years ago, the story runs, Gerlach made the acquaintance of\r\n     a worldly minded papal Nuntius in the fashionable salons of\r\n     gay Vienna, and, being men of similar tastes and\r\n     proclivities, the two enjoyed life together, eking out the\r\n     wherewithal for their costly amusements in speculations on\r\n     the Exchange. When the Nuntius returned to Rome, donned the\r\n     Cardinal's hat, and was appointed to the See of Albano as\r\n     Cardinal Agliardi, he bestowed a canonry on the boon\r\n     companion who had followed him to the eternal city. The\r\n     friendship continued unabated, and was further cemented by\r\n     the identity of their political opinions, which favored the\r\n     Triple Alliance. Gerlach became Agliardi's tout and\r\n     electioneering agent when that Cardinal set up as candidate\r\n     for the papacy on the death of Leo XIII. But as his chances\r\n     of election were slender, the pair worked together to defeat\r\n     Rampolla, who was hated and feared by Germany and Austria.\r\n     Their bitter opponent was Cardinal Richard, a witty French\r\n     prelate who labored might and main for Rampolla, and told me\r\n     some amusing stories about Agliardi. Some years ago\r\n     Gerlach's name emerged above the surface of private life in\r\n     Rome in connection with what the French term _un drame\r\n     passionel_, which led to violent scenes in public and to a\r\n     number of duels later on. That this man of violent\r\n     Pan-German sentiments should be the Pope's mentor and guide\r\n     through the labyrinth of international politics seems a\r\n     curious anachronism.\r\n\r\nAlthough Cardinal della Chiesa, shortly before he became Benedict XV.,\r\nwas spoken of as the inheritor of Rampolla's Francophile leanings, it\r\nis \"now conjectured that at the Conclave this legend secured from his\r\nnot only the votes of the Teutonic Cardinals, who knew what his\r\nsentiments really were, but also those of the French and Belgians, who\r\nerroneously fancied that they knew,\" Dr. Dillon says. He does not\r\nhesitate to believe that the Pope is \"at heart a staunch friend of\r\nAustria and a warm admirer of Germany, whom he looks upon as the\r\nembodiment of the principle of authority and conservatism.\" For the\r\nVatican his words are more unsparing:\r\n\r\n     The Vatican, as distinguished from the Pope, was and is\r\n     systematically hostile to the Allies. Its press organs,\r\n     inspired by an astute and influential Italian ecclesiastic\r\n     named Tedeschini, by Koeppenberg, a rabid German convert,\r\n     and by the Calabrian Daffina, organized a formidable\r\n     campaign against the King's Government and their supposed\r\n     interventionist leanings. Its agents, including the priest\r\n     Boncampagni and the German Catholics Erzberger, Koeppenberg,\r\n     and others, were wont to meet in the Hotel de Russie to\r\n     arrange their daily plan of campaign, and when at last the\r\n     people rose up against Giolitti and his enormities, the\r\n     Vatican had its mob in readiness to make\r\n     counter-demonstrations, and was prevented from letting it\r\n     loose only by the superhuman efforts of decent Catholics and\r\n     orderly citizens. It is a fair thing to add that the\r\n     attitude of the Roman Catholic clergy throughout Italy has\r\n     with some few exceptions been consistently patriotic. Even\r\n     the bishops and archbishops of the provinces have deserved\r\n     well of their King and country, while their flocks have left\r\n     nothing to be desired on the score of loyalty and\r\n     patriotism.\r\n\r\nBuelow's mission to Italy and his relations with Giolitti, the\r\ndefeated abettor of Austria in the business preceding Italy's\r\ndeclaration of war, when they encountered the statecraft of Sonnino\r\nand Salandra, are given in this version of Buelow's playing of his\r\n\"trump card\":\r\n\r\n     Although the die was cast and Italy's decision taken, he had\r\n     the Austrian concessions greatly amplified, and he offered\r\n     them, _not to the King's Government_, but to Giolitti, his\r\n     secret ally, who was not in office, but was known to be the\r\n     Dictator of Italy. And Giolitti accepted them on the\r\n     condition, to be fulfilled after the Cabinet's fall, that\r\n     the territory would be further enlarged and consigned to\r\n     Italy before the end of the war. The increase of prestige\r\n     which this concession would bestow on the tribune was to be\r\n     his reward for co-operation with the German Ambassador.\r\n     Giolitti having thus approved the offer, undertook to have\r\n     it ratified by Parliament, _in spite of the engagements\r\n     which the Cabinet had already entered into with the Allied\r\n     Powers_. In this sense he spoke to the King, wrote a letter\r\n     designed for the nation, and obtained the public adhesion of\r\n     a majority of the Chamber which was not then sitting.\r\n     Thereupon the Cabinet resigned and left the destinies of\r\n     Italy in the hands of the King and the nation. On the part\r\n     of the Cabinet this was a brilliant tactical move and a\r\n     further proof of the praiseworthy moral courage which it had\r\n     displayed throughout the crisis. Indeed, the firmness,\r\n     perseverance, and dignified disregard of mild invective and\r\n     more deliberate criticism manifested by Sonnino and\r\n     Salandra, entitle these Ministers to the lasting gratitude\r\n     of their country. For it should be borne in mind that they\r\n     had against them not only the Senate, the Chamber, a section\r\n     of the Press, the \"cream\" of the aristocracy, the puny sons\r\n     and daughters of the leaders of the Risorgimento, but also,\r\n     strange to say, the majority of Italian diplomatists in the\r\n     capitals of the Great Powers, one of whom actually fell ill\r\n     at the thought that Italy was about to fight shoulder to\r\n     shoulder with the State to which he was accredited. It would\r\n     be interesting to psychologists to learn how this\r\n     diplomatist and one or two of his colleagues felt when a few\r\n     days later they were serenaded by enthusiastic crowds whom\r\n     they were constrained to address.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre the Allies Winning?\r\n\r\nIn a Doubting Thomas article headed \"Are We Winning?\" the anonymous\r\n\"Outis\" in The Fortnightly Review concludes that \"the Allies are\r\nwinning, but very slowly. If their conquest is to be assured, Great\r\nBritain's task is to mobilize every soldier and every workman, in\r\norder to prove that whoever may fail, she at least does not intend to\r\ndesist until the final triumph is won.\" Moreover, the conquest must be\r\nin the West \"if anywhere,\" and he looks somewhat askance at the\r\nDardanelles adventure:\r\n\r\n     A good many competent authorities have disliked the idea of\r\n     the Dardanelles expedition, on the strength of a general\r\n     principle applicable to all military operations. It is said\r\n     that in every war there is one distinct objective, and that\r\n     that should never be neglected for any subsidiary\r\n     operations. Thus, in the present instance, our main effort\r\n     is to drive the Germans out of France and Belgium, and then\r\n     to attack them in their own territory. Anything which\r\n     interferes with this or throws it, however temporarily, into\r\n     the background, is held to be unwise, because it leads to\r\n     the most dangerous of results in warfare--the dissipation of\r\n     forces, which, if united, would win the desired success, but\r\n     if disunited will probably fail. Thus we are told that we\r\n     must not fritter away our energies in enterprises which,\r\n     however important in themselves, are not comparable with the\r\n     one unique preoccupation of our minds--the conquest of\r\n     Germany in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelling Arms to the Allies\r\n\r\nHorace White has no two opinions in his article in The North American\r\nReview for July as to the wisdom and justice of the practice of\r\nAmerican manufacturers in selling munitions which the Allies are using\r\nto kill their Germanic enemies. Mr. White expresses it as the belief\r\nof the great majority of people in the United States that Germany's\r\nwar is without sufficient cause, and that when she invaded Belgium she\r\n\"made herself the outlaw of the nations--a country whom no agreements\r\ncan bind.\" Therefore he can see why no limit should ever be put to the\r\nworld's expenditure for armaments \"while one incorrigible outlaw is at\r\nlarge.\" He adds:\r\n\r\n     It is the opinion of most Americans that the most\r\n     incorrigible and dangerous outlaw and armed maniac now\r\n     existing is Germany, and that the first and indispensable\r\n     step toward a restriction of armaments and a quiet world is\r\n     to throttle and disarm her, and that no price is too great\r\n     to pay for such a consummation. Any result of the present\r\n     war which falls short of this will be the preliminary to a\r\n     new armament and another war on a wider scale than the\r\n     present one, since the United States will make preparations\r\n     for the next one and most probably take part in it.\r\n\r\nHence proceeds Mr. White's justification for this neutral nation's\r\nsupplying the Allies with arms:\r\n\r\n     Germany, by bursting her way through Belgium, was enabled to\r\n     seize eighty to ninety per cent. of the coal and iron\r\n     resources of France and the greater part of her apparatus\r\n     for the production of arms. She holds also the entire\r\n     resources of Belgium, both of raw material and finished\r\n     product. The foul blow by which she possessed herself of\r\n     these indispensable treasures had two consequences which she\r\n     did not look for--the active hostility of England and the\r\n     moral indignation of all other nations. In helping France to\r\n     make good the loss which she sustained through such perfidy\r\n     the American people think that they are doing God's service,\r\n     and their only regret is that they cannot do more of it. If\r\n     they had foreseen the present conditions they would have\r\n     enlarged their gun factories and powder mills to meet the\r\n     emergency more promptly.\r\n\r\n     A German writer in the New York _Times_ of May 30, Mr. Vom\r\n     Bruck, says: \"If the German nation is wiped out with the\r\n     help of American arms and ammunition no man of the white\r\n     race in the United States would be able to think of such a\r\n     catastrophe without horror and remorse.\" All of the\r\n     contending nations say that they are fighting for existence,\r\n     which means that if they do not win in the end they will be\r\n     wiped out. With such an alternative staring us in the face\r\n     very few tears would be shed by Americans, of any color, if\r\n     both the Hohenzollerns and the Hapsburgs, with all their\r\n     belongings, should be wiped off the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar and Non-Resistance\r\n\r\nThe pacifist \"mollycoddle,\" as Theodore Roosevelt dubbed him in his\r\nSan Francisco Exposition speech, finds expression in these words of\r\nBertrand Russell in the August number of the Atlantic Monthly:\r\n\r\n     All these three motives for armaments--cowardice, love of\r\n     dominion, and lust for blood--are no longer ineradicable in\r\n     civilized human nature. All are diminishing under the\r\n     influence of modern social organization. All might be\r\n     reduced to a degree which would make them almost innocuous,\r\n     if early education and current moral standards were directed\r\n     to that end. Passive resistance, if it were adopted\r\n     deliberately by the will of a whole nation, with the same\r\n     measure of courage and discipline which is now displayed in\r\n     war, might achieve a far more perfect protection for what is\r\n     good in national life than armies and navies can ever\r\n     achieve, without demanding the carnage and waste and welter\r\n     of brutality involved in modern war.\r\n\r\nBut it is hardly to be expected, Mr. Russell reluctantly concludes,\r\nthat progress will come in this way, because \"the imaginative effort\r\nrequired is too great.\" He adds:\r\n\r\n     It is much more likely that it will come, like the reign of\r\n     law within the state, by the establishment of a central\r\n     government of the world, able and willing to secure\r\n     obedience by force, because the great majority of men will\r\n     recognize that obedience is better than the present\r\n     international anarchy.\r\n\r\n     A central government of this kind would command assent not\r\n     as a partisan, but as the representative of the interests of\r\n     the whole. Very soon resistance to it would be seen to be\r\n     hopeless and wars would cease. Force directed by a neutral\r\n     authority is not open to the same abuse or likely to cause\r\n     the same long-drawn conflicts as force exercised by\r\n     quarreling nations, each of which is the judge in its own\r\n     cause. Although I firmly believe that the adoption of\r\n     passive instead of active resistance would be good if a\r\n     nation could be convinced of its goodness, yet it is rather\r\n     to the ultimate creation of a strong central authority that\r\n     I should look for the ending of war. But war will end only\r\n     after a great labor has been performed in altering men's\r\n     moral ideals, directing them to the good of all mankind, and\r\n     not only of the separate nations into which men happen to\r\n     have been born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Good Natured Germany\"\r\n\r\nThe leading article in the June issue of the Sueddeutsche Monatshefte\r\n(Munich) is by Dr. George Grupp, one of Germany's most able scholars,\r\nand is entitled, \"Never Can Germany be Overcome if She be United.\" Dr.\r\nGrupp finds evidences for this assertion all through history, and\r\nquotes some of the earliest commentators and historians to this\r\neffect:\r\n\r\n     As early as 1487 Felix Fabri, a Dominican of Ulm wrote: \"Si\r\n     Germani essent ubique concordes, totum orbem domarent.\" (If\r\n     the Germans were united they would conquer the whole world.)\r\n\r\n     The sentence is an echo of the fiery address which one\r\n     Aeneas Silvius, later to become pope, delivered to the\r\n     German princes after the fall of Constantinople, and from\r\n     which Felix Fabri himself gives a quotation....\r\n\r\n     To Germany alone the Greeks looked for any considerable\r\n     help. An evidence of this is the beautiful and often quoted\r\n     remark of the Athenian Laonikos Chalkokondylas: \"If the\r\n     Germans were united and the princes would obey, they would\r\n     be unconquerable and the strongest of all mortals.\"\r\n\r\n     We encounter similar statements very frequently, both\r\n     earlier and later, from the Roman courtier Dietrich von\r\n     Nieheim and from the humanists, from the Alsatian Wimpheling\r\n     and Sebastian Brant, from the Swabian Nauclerus and the\r\n     Frank Pirckheimer. \"What could Germany be,\" they cry, \"if\r\n     she would only make use of her own strength, exploit her own\r\n     resources for herself! No people on earth could offer her\r\n     resistance!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Grupp claims that Germany's lack of unity has resulted only from\r\nher rule of goodwill toward all, within her borders as well as\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n     It never occurred to the Germans as to other peoples to\r\n     disturb the peaceful development of their neighbors. They\r\n     allowed mighty powers to build themselves up unmolested and\r\n     to rise above Germany's head. In their internal affairs they\r\n     observed the same principle of justice; no line, no class,\r\n     no province, no grant succeeded in obtaining so oppressive\r\n     an ascendancy, that other lines and classes, other provinces\r\n     and grants were simply annihilated. The unfortunate\r\n     consequence was lack of unity.\r\n\r\n     Nowhere were or are there so many cultural centres, so many\r\n     different movements, tendencies, parties. This great\r\n     multifariousness of the German life was recognized and\r\n     admired by others. But this very multifariousness had its\r\n     darker side, the fatal, much deplored lack of unity.\r\n\r\nThrough the centuries, Dr. Grupp claims, Germany has been altogether\r\ntoo good-natured, allowing other nations to all but bleed her to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n     In her peaceable disharmony Germany has dreamed along\r\n     carelessly and good-naturedly for centuries until the abrupt\r\n     awakening when she saw a yawning abyss opened up at her\r\n     feet. Good-naturedly she has allowed herself to be plundered\r\n     and faithfully she has fought other nations' battles. As\r\n     early as the 15th century the humanists remarked the fact\r\n     that alien states gladly took German soldiers into their\r\n     service, and later on it was worse than that. Foreign\r\n     countries gladly waged their wars on German territory. Here\r\n     was decided for the most part the fate of the Spanish\r\n     world-empire, here France and England battled for supremacy.\r\n     The Seven Years' War was not only a question of Schleswig;\r\n     it was a question of whether North America and even far-away\r\n     India should be French or English.\r\n\r\n     Now the condition is suddenly reversed; the Germans are\r\n     fighting for themselves, and the fact arouses the limitless\r\n     rage of their opponents. Let us console ourselves with the\r\n     fact that even in the Middle Ages it was said: \"Teutonici\r\n     nullius amici,\" in spite of their peaceableness.\r\n\r\n\r\nItaly's Defection\r\n\r\nDr. Eduard Meyer has contributed an article to the Sueddeutsche\r\nMonatshefte (Munich) on \"Ancient Italy and the Rise of the Italian\r\nNation.\" Dr. Meyer is professor of history in the University of\r\nBerlin, and is a brother of Dr. Kuno Meyer who recently attracted much\r\nattention in this country by severing his connection with Harvard\r\nUniversity because of a prize \"war poem\" written by one of the\r\nundergraduates. A postscript reflects Dr. Meyer's present feeling\r\ntoward Italy's defection:\r\n\r\n     The views which I have presented in this article are the\r\n     fruit of long years of study and research; and I feel myself\r\n     constrained to state explicitly that they are in no wise\r\n     influenced by the events which we have experienced during\r\n     the last few weeks. But it may be that a short postscript is\r\n     necessary.\r\n\r\n     Italy has not won her present national unity by reason of\r\n     her own strength; she owes it to the combinations of the\r\n     changing world-situation and the victories of foreign\r\n     powers, which her statesmen have known how to use to the\r\n     best advantage.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Meyer, Italy's claim to be one of the great powers is\r\nnot based on any actual ability to uphold that claim; it merely\r\nhappens that her assertion has not been challenged.\r\n\r\n     She has claimed for herself the status of a great power on a\r\n     par with the other large nations of the world; but she has\r\n     not possessed the inner strength of herself to support such\r\n     a claim without the help of stronger powers.\r\n\r\n     In August, 1914, Italy had the opportunity to decide her\r\n     fate. If she could have made the choice then, if she could\r\n     have gone into the world-war with all the might that she\r\n     possessed and, staking her whole existence, have fought\r\n     toward the highest goal, she might have won for herself a\r\n     powerful and self-sufficient place in the world.\r\n\r\nOn account of his many utterances since the outbreak of the war,\r\nLudwig Thoma's Maerz (Munich), a weekly founded by him, has attracted\r\nmuch attention. An article entitled \"Italy's Defection,\" in a recent\r\nissue, is most bitter in tone, accusing Italy of long-standing\r\nintrigue and treachery.\r\n\r\n     We know that Italy went still further from the fact that at\r\n     the renewal of the alliance in 1912 in Paris she expressly\r\n     announced that she would not march against France. It will\r\n     be remembered how quick the French army command was to take\r\n     stock of relations on the southeastern border, with the\r\n     result that in the very first days of mobilization their\r\n     troops were called from the Savoy Alps and by the eighth of\r\n     August were giving battle on the Alsatian border.\r\n\r\n     But Italy still guarded the neutrality which she had\r\n     proclaimed and with apparent reasonableness she was able to\r\n     hold that the letter of the Triple Alliance did not compel\r\n     her to enter the conflict. Laughing in her sleeve she could\r\n     even give it out that her sympathetic neutrality would\r\n     sufficiently guarantee to her allies certain suspended\r\n     contracts of an economic nature. Neutral Italy furnished\r\n     Germany to a considerable extent with products of its own\r\n     land and others which were not unwelcome.\r\n\r\n     That the mobilization of an Italian army on France's borders\r\n     might have been able to decide the war as far back as\r\n     September, is a consideration which, in the face of this\r\n     hypocritical neutrality, one cannot face without driving\r\n     one's nails into one's flesh!\r\n\r\nIt was through the connivance of England that Italy weakly found\r\nherself forced to enter the war against her former allies.\r\n\r\n     Sir Edward Grey found the way to do it. Italy learned that\r\n     England was no longer in a situation to hold the Straits of\r\n     Gibraltar and the Suez Canal open and was obliged to take\r\n     over the control of Italian imports. Even before this\r\n     British agents had control of the port of Genoa and there\r\n     was no doubt that through most irritating measures on\r\n     England's part which skillfully concealed the motive behind\r\n     them, a blow would be struck at the very roots of Italy's\r\n     existence and famine would set in. Presently the Italian\r\n     politicians and the crown were confronted with a dilemma\r\n     which left them the choice only between war and\r\n     revolution....\r\n\r\n     Not every people has the political government which it\r\n     deserves; the Italian people are the victims of a\r\n     government, essentially undeserved but traditionally\r\n     faithless.\r\n\r\n     But Mars is now shaking the dice and behind the curtain of\r\n     the future Revolution stands waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nApologies for English Words\r\n\r\nAn indication of the height to which the \"Gott Strafe England\" feeling\r\nhas climbed in Germany is shown in the following announcement by the\r\nmanagement of Die Woche (Berlin):\r\n\r\n     TO OUR READERS!\r\n\r\n     Many readers of Die Woche have taken offense at the words\r\n     \"Copyright by ...\" (in English) and demand that this English\r\n     formula be rendered hereafter in German. This desire,\r\n     springing from patriotic motives, is easily understood, but\r\n     unfortunately cannot be carried out for the form \"Copyright\r\n     by ...\" is demanded by the American copyright law in this\r\n     form. If we did not print these words in English, which is\r\n     the official language of the United States, our copyright in\r\n     America would be void and the protection both of ourselves\r\n     and our writers would be forfeited.\r\n\r\n\r\nGermanic Peace Terms\r\n\r\n[From the Budapest Correspondent of The London Morning Post.]\r\n\r\nTo the Revue de Hongrie, the only French paper in Budapest, Count\r\nAndrassy contributes an article for July entitled \"Les garanties d'une\r\npaix durable,\" and discusses the peace terms the Central Empires are\r\nto put forward in the event of final victory. He objects to the idea\r\nof annexation or anything more than \"boundary corrections,\" and says:\r\n\r\n     Our war is a defensive war, which will achieve its aim when\r\n     our enemies have been expelled from our territory and their\r\n     ring has been broken. This aim could be best served by\r\n     making peace with one or other of our enemies and winning\r\n     him over to our cause. This would be of immense advantage to\r\n     the future of civilization and ensure us against the horrors\r\n     of a prolonged war. A separate peace would be the best\r\n     chance for certain Powers to change their international\r\n     policy. To my mind the issues of this war will greatly\r\n     change the attitude of some hostile States toward us, and\r\n     will bring about more intimate relations between them and\r\n     ourselves, besides widening the foundations of the alliance\r\n     between Hungary and her allies. And this is to be the rock\r\n     upon which the European balance of power is to rest in the\r\n     future. Our war is not a war of conquest, and the boundary\r\n     changes of which some people speak are not the _sine qua\r\n     non_ of a good peace. Therefore I do not even wish to speak\r\n     about certain territorial alterations, which, nevertheless,\r\n     might be necessary.\r\n\r\nRegarding the question of England and nationality, Count Andrassy\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     Victory no doubt affords us the right to demand the\r\n     alteration of the map of Europe, yet, this not being our aim\r\n     and not to our interest, we can be satisfied with certain\r\n     compensations, as no doubt our enemies would not spare us if\r\n     they were victorious. Lloyd George said that the States are\r\n     to be shaped in the future according to nationalities, which\r\n     means that the Monarchy is to be disrupted. An English\r\n     scholar not long ago expressed the same view, and, in fact,\r\n     in England this idea is being impressed upon the people.\r\n     This policy is sounded in a country which dominates so many\r\n     millions of alien nationalities. If England speaks in this\r\n     way, though she is not in direct conflict with us, what can\r\n     we expect from Russia or Italy? Everyone knows that Russia\r\n     wants Galicia, the Bukovina, Maramaros; Serbia wants Bosnia,\r\n     Herzegovina, Croatia, Slavonia, and the Banat; Italy they\r\n     won to their side by promising her our territory;\r\n     Transylvania is promised to the one who cares to take it;\r\n     henceforth, if we wish to defend it, we shall have to\r\n     prepare for a new attack from another quarter. Yet nothing\r\n     would be more alien to our thoughts than that if victorious\r\n     we should annex foreign territory, for we would have\r\n     seriously to consider if such conquest would be to our\r\n     advantage or not. The same policy ought to be applied in\r\n     Germany. Though her enemies would not spare her either, she\r\n     must be cautious not to go too far in her appetites, and\r\n     should seek for monetary compensations. Most of all she has\r\n     to be careful not to claim territory, which would mean\r\n     everlasting unrest and a new irredentism. It would be a bad\r\n     policy even to touch the Balkans, for such interference\r\n     would sooner or later bring Russia back to the Balkans, and\r\n     the peoples there, menaced in their independence by us,\r\n     would turn to Russia. We would thus place nations used to\r\n     independence under alien rule, and such an act would neither\r\n     be a wise nor a paying policy.\r\n\r\nAs regards Italy, Count Andrassy has also a solution which is quite\r\ngenerous. He says:\r\n\r\n     We would not do well if we were influenced by just revenge\r\n     and turned our eyes on Italian territory. To force territory\r\n     from a country whose people are so patriotic would be a\r\n     source of weakness on our part. In the worst case, only\r\n     boundary corrections can be thought of, and no conquest.\r\n     Italy must recompense us by money and not territory, for not\r\n     the Italian people, but its Government, committed a breach\r\n     of faith against us.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance's Bill of Damages\r\n\r\nThe agricultural problem in France is the subject of an article by\r\nProfessor Daniel Zolla in La Revue Hebdomadaire (Paris). Professor\r\nZolla is a leader in the agricultural school at Grignon, and the main\r\npart of his article is a discussion of France's agricultural losses\r\nand how to repair them. He sums the present situation as follows:\r\n\r\n     At the end of May the enemy were occupying territory\r\n     amounting to about two million hectares. In this zone as in\r\n     the regions invaded though immediately evacuated, the\r\n     agricultural losses have been admittedly severe: harvests,\r\n     livestock, implements, fodder, have been stolen or\r\n     destroyed; the buildings, burned or ruined, will have to be\r\n     entirely rebuilt. The soil itself, ploughed with trenches,\r\n     dug up by shells, infested with weeds, has lost much of its\r\n     fertility....\r\n\r\n     In the invaded region which is one of the richest and most\r\n     fertile in all France, the farming capital amounts at the\r\n     least to five hundred francs per hectare, not counting the\r\n     value of the buildings and of the land itself. For a total\r\n     of two million hectares, the sum thus represented in the\r\n     personal advances of farmers reach or surpass a billion, for\r\n     in French Flanders and in Artois this minimum estimate of\r\n     five hundred francs is greatly exceeded.\r\n\r\nConcerning future indemnification for these losses, Professor Zolla\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     It is the entire country at which the enemy wished to strike\r\n     by ruining a certain number of the people; it is the country\r\n     which should repair the ruin and indemnify the losses. Never\r\n     will the principle of national solidarity apply with more\r\n     justice and reason. The interest of the state can demand, it\r\n     is true, that the victim who has become a creditor of the\r\n     country shall not exact immediate payment of the sums due\r\n     him. This is a question of the time needed to enable the\r\n     country to pay and the representatives of the nation must be\r\n     the judges of that.\r\n\r\n     But admitting the principle, it will suffice if it be known\r\n     that the Treasury accepts the liability; it will be\r\n     sufficient if certain annuities are promised and managed so\r\n     that the parties can procure through the ordinary avenues of\r\n     credit, the necessary indemnities.\r\n\r\n     This is the method which the National Assembly adopted in\r\n     1873. A sum of one hundred and eleven millions voted as\r\n     relief, was represented by twenty-six annuities including\r\n     interest at five per cent. and redemption.\r\n\r\nProfessor Zolla admits that France is going to encounter a serious\r\ndifficulty in the scarcity of labor which is sure to follow the close\r\nof the war. It is not too early, he advises, to begin working on the\r\nsolution of this problem so that France will be ready to meet it when\r\nit arises:\r\n\r\n     There are in the main, two methods by which the scarcity of\r\n     farm labor can be offset:\r\n\r\n     1. By multiplying the machines which replace manual labor,\r\n\r\n     2. By modifying our agricultural methods so that preference\r\n     is given to those which demand the least proportion of\r\n     manual labor....\r\n\r\n     All the associations which are fortunately so numerous in\r\n     our country, all the agricultural societies, all the\r\n     co-operative societies which are already formed, should\r\n     double their efforts to put at the disposition of their\r\n     members those implements which on account of their high\r\n     price are not available for the individual farmer.\r\n\r\nPrices will rise after the war, but this, argues Professor Zolla, will\r\nbe beneficial rather than otherwise.\r\n\r\n     High prices will be offset by large production: this excess\r\n     of production will, however, follow on the activity of the\r\n     rural producer, and that activity will be maintained and\r\n     increased by high prices which always insure large profits.\r\n\r\n     In short, the rise in price wall be most favorable to the\r\n     agricultural interests just at a time when the difficulties\r\n     of obtaining labor will come to swell the necessary expenses\r\n     of production. The crisis which might be in store is thus\r\n     dissipated and the agricultural situation remains much as it\r\n     was before the war--that is to say, very satisfactory.\r\n\r\n     The losses undergone will be considerable in the invaded\r\n     regions, the obstacles which the farmer must overcome will\r\n     be great but not insurmountable, but success will recompense\r\n     the valor and the hard labor of our countrymen. And to be\r\n     just we must not forget that this will be made possible by\r\n     the work of the French women in the fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nA French Rejoinder\r\n\r\nIn the Revue des Deux Mondes (Paris), of which he is managing editor,\r\nM. Francis Charmes, of the Academie Francaise, replies to a speech\r\nmade by von Bethmann-Hollweg before the Reichstag, in which the German\r\nChancellor expressed sympathy for the deluded French soldiers, who\r\nhad not an inkling of the true course which the war was taking. M.\r\nCharmes ironically remarks:\r\n\r\n     We do not publish, he [von Bethmann-Hollweg] claims, any of\r\n     the German dispatches, so that opinion is quite\r\n     unenlightened as to what is actually happening on the field\r\n     of battle.\r\n\r\n     One would think, according to M. de Bethmann-Hollweg, that\r\n     the German dispatches are a source on which one can rely\r\n     with full confidence, and one would imagine, too, since he\r\n     had thus reproached us, that the German newspapers published\r\n     the French dispatches.\r\n\r\n     As a matter of fact, they do not and if it is necessary to\r\n     hear both sides to know the truth then the Germans are quite\r\n     ignorant of it. They are indeed very far removed from\r\n     knowing it, and it is a constant surprise to our officers\r\n     and our soldiers to discover when they question their\r\n     prisoners, the profound illusions under which they labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. von Bode's Polemic\r\n\r\nSome time ago Dr. Wilhelm von Bode, the well-known director of the\r\nBerlin Art Museums and Germany's authority in matters of art, issued a\r\njustification of German conduct in Rheims and Louvain, which he\r\nsupported by a review of Germany's world-contribution to art. \"The\r\nGerman Science of Art and the War,\" was the title of the article.\r\nJacques Mesnil, writing in the Mercure de France, presents a reply to\r\nDr. von Bode's polemic.\r\n\r\nHe brands as infantile the reasoning by which Dr. Bode proves the\r\nGerman soldier incapable of destroying a work of art. The German\r\nprofessor stated that civilization, and with it art, could not have\r\nsurvived were it not for the protection of German militarism. M.\r\nMesnil replies:\r\n\r\n     M. Bode should have been able to separate a little better\r\n     two things which have nothing to do with each other:\r\n     strategy and the history of art. He should have explained\r\n     the conduct of the soldiers by the service which is required\r\n     of them; he should have pointed out precisely the point of\r\n     view of the archaeologist as incompatible with that of the\r\n     warrior and he should have freed of responsibility those\r\n     who, loving the picturesque old cities and the pure\r\n     creations of artists, could not sympathize with those who\r\n     destroy them.\r\n\r\n     Far from this, he has invoked the merits of German science\r\n     to justify the outrages of the soldiery and in his eyes the\r\n     fact that German savants have added to the progress of\r\n     archaeology suffices to prove that the German army is\r\n     incapable of destroying works of art.\r\n\r\nExamination of Professor von Bode's claim that Germany leads the world\r\nin the \"science of art,\" would seem to M. Mesnil to show that the\r\nGerman art-scientist is little more than a painstaking classifier, a\r\nmere cataloguer.\r\n\r\n     Taken as a whole, the art historians in Germany are a lot of\r\n     excellent laborers, energetic and conscientious, who could\r\n     render valuable service were they well directed. But it is\r\n     precisely their direction which is at fault. Those among\r\n     them who play the role of leader do not know how to\r\n     distinguish the relative importance of the problems which\r\n     come to their consideration; in confused multitude of facts,\r\n     they follow a purely exterior and quite military order in\r\n     their classifications; in the same way that a man in the\r\n     army is a man only and that all the human units are in rigid\r\n     divisions, so for the apostles of \"the science of art\" a\r\n     fact is a fact and automatically falls under the head\r\n     destined for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Carnegie and German Peace\"\r\n\r\nAn article in La Revue (Paris), \"Carnegie and the German Peace,\" would\r\nseem to indicate that France is not yet looking toward peace. The\r\narticle is by Jean Finot himself, the well-known editor and publisher\r\nof La Revue, and it gives the pacifists short shrift indeed. The\r\nAmerican peace propaganda, M. Finot characterizes as \"the attempt at\r\ncorruption,\" and he holds Mr. Carnegie responsible:\r\n\r\n     Unfortunately Mr. Carnegie endeavors to keep them [his\r\n     opinions regarding peace] alive by supporting them with\r\n     considerable sums of money for their diffusion abroad. A\r\n     movement for \"a German peace\" has thus sprung up in America\r\n     and it is taking on more and more disquieting\r\n     proportions....\r\n\r\n     Mr. Carnegie has been accused and not perhaps without\r\n     reason, of subsidizing many Germanophile publications and\r\n     thus of aiding in the work of corruption which Germany and\r\n     her agents are carrying on throughout the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe recent peace congress of women at The Hague comes in for some\r\nstrong language:\r\n\r\n     The international congress of women pacifists seems to be\r\n     due to Mr. Carnegie's generosity. This poisoning of public\r\n     opinion, carried out systematically by his agents and his\r\n     money, has become particularly odious. We do not suspect the\r\n     honesty of his intentions, but we deplore his profound lack\r\n     of comprehension of the events which have been taking place\r\n     before his eyes.\r\n\r\n     Among the American women noted for their talent and\r\n     character, Miss Jane Addams occupies a prominent place. But\r\n     it seems that her sturdy honesty was not sufficient to\r\n     resist the temptation of putting herself at the heels of Mr.\r\n     Carnegie. We are convinced the charges of other than purely\r\n     disinterested motives against Miss Addams are wholly\r\n     unjustified. But she has participated in the women's\r\n     congress at The Hague under truly regrettable conditions.\r\n\r\nM. Finot's references to Chautauqua and the part it plays in the\r\npreparation of American opinion are veiled but none the less\r\nsuggestive:\r\n\r\n     The important role which the Chautauqua conferences play in\r\n     the United States is well known. These conferences of\r\n     teachers which have so profound an influence on American\r\n     opinion have been supported by Mr. Carnegie in the interests\r\n     of realizing this idea of a precipitate peace, of a German\r\n     peace. All manner of adventurers and seekers of easy\r\n     fortunes have gathered around this strange deviation of the\r\n     pacifist ideal represented by the multi-millionaire and the\r\n     men of his stripe.\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia's Supply of Warriors\r\n\r\nIn an article headed \"Ought the War to Last Long--and Can It Last\r\nLong?\" V. Kuzmin-Karavaeff says in the Russian European Messenger for\r\nJune:\r\n\r\n     It is, of course, impossible to say how long the war will\r\n     last. But the case is altered if the question be put in\r\n     another form: _Ought_ the war to last long, and _can_ it\r\n     last long? The ten months which have elapsed make it\r\n     entirely possible to answer it, for, in answering it, there\r\n     is no need to guess at the thoughts, wishes, and hopes of\r\n     the Germans which are bound up with the war.\r\n\r\n     In the eyes of Russia and her Allies the present war has as\r\n     its object the crushing and dispersing of \"the nest of\r\n     militarism,\" constructed in the centre of Europe by the hand\r\n     of Bismarck and the vainglory of Wilhelm II. That was\r\n     clearly defined last autumn by our diplomatic department.\r\n     That is precisely the way in which it was and is defined by\r\n     all classes of the Russian people, not excluding those who\r\n     are represented by Kropotkin and Plekhanoff. The present war\r\n     became far more for Germany than a war for the integrity of\r\n     her territory, for her colonial interests, or for her\r\n     commercial supremacy, from the moment when three--now\r\n     four--great powers rose at her arrogant challenge. Germany\r\n     is everywhere attacking, but, in reality, she is conducting\r\n     a desperate war of defence for the organization of her\r\n     existence, which, for the space of forty years, has rested\r\n     on a nervous anticipation of war with her neighbors.\r\n     Germany's offensive is a strategical manoeuvre. As a\r\n     matter of fact, she is fighting like a wild animal\r\n     surrounded on all sides. And, of course, she will carry on\r\n     the war until the last degree of exhaustion is reached. She\r\n     has accumulated within her many forces--technical forces.\r\n     Mere technical forces cannot stand their ground in the end.\r\n     But no little time must still elapse. And the war _must_\r\n     continue for a long time still, if the \"nest of militarism\"\r\n     is to be annihilated.\r\n\r\n     But, on the other hand, _can_ it continue a long time? We\r\n     Russians have a complete right to say, with conviction: Yes.\r\n     Ten months of war have plainly demonstrated that we still\r\n     possess a land which is still intact, and personal and\r\n     economic forces.\r\n\r\n     To the east of the Dnieper and Moscow the war is hardly felt\r\n     at all. This is particularly true of the principal\r\n     foundations of our life--the peasant country parts numbering\r\n     their hundred millions. The villages have sent to the war\r\n     millions of young men, and even fathers of families, heads\r\n     of households. Many tears have already been shed in the\r\n     country, and there are many orphans, many cripples. But the\r\n     peasant countryside has not suffered economically. On the\r\n     contrary, after ten months of war and closed liquor-shops,\r\n     it has reconstructed itself and smartened itself up to a\r\n     noteworthy degree. The fields have been sown. From among the\r\n     huge mass only those laboring hands have been withdrawn for\r\n     the war which would not have remained at home in any case,\r\n     but would have been lured away to earn money elsewhere.\r\n\r\n     The same thing is observable also in the towns. The masses\r\n     in the towns have increased their deposits in the savings\r\n     banks tenfold, while consuming more meat than before the\r\n     war, and resorting less frequently to the loan banks.\r\n     Information made its way out of Germany long ago to the\r\n     effect that all the males there, with the exception of\r\n     decrepit old men and small children, have been called to the\r\n     army. The peculiar \"crisis in men\" in Berlin has frequently\r\n     served as a subject of jest in the humorous press.\r\n\r\n     In Russia, every railway station swarms with young, healthy,\r\n     powerful porters who offer their services; every large\r\n     restaurant has a host of waiters; the wharves on the Volga\r\n     and, in conclusion, the mere throngs on the streets bear\r\n     witness to the fact that nothing resembling the \"crisis in\r\n     men\" exists with us. Numerous as have been the soldiers who\r\n     have gone to the war, the supply of men who are capable of\r\n     bearing arms is still colossally great with us.\r\n     Consequently, we have the material to fill up losses in the\r\n     army. And that being the case, we can go on with the war for\r\n     a long time to come--for as long a time as may be necessary\r\n     to bring it to a proper ending.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAKE JONESCO\r\n\r\nA Former Cabinet Minister, and Leader of Pro-Ally Party in Rumania\r\n\r\n(_Photo from Central News._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEMETRIOS GOUNARIS\r\n\r\nLeader of the Neutralist Party, who Succeeded Venizelos as Premier of\r\nGreece]\r\n\r\n\r\nAustria and the Balkans\r\n\r\nGermanic influences in the Balkan Peninsula are discussed by A.\r\nPogodin in the magazine Russian Thought. Mr. Pogodin says:\r\n\r\n     Without having in view any acquisitions whatsoever in the\r\n     northern part of the Peninsula, Russia is deeply interested\r\n     in seeing to it that Germanic influence does not acquire\r\n     preponderance there, because that influence, in its turn,\r\n     has no aims save territorial acquisition. The Balkan\r\n     Peninsula is admitted to be the most influential camp of\r\n     Pan-Germanism for the colony desired by the Germanic world,\r\n     from which it is but a step to Central Asia. And it was this\r\n     plan that Russia was compelled to combat. Unfortunately, she\r\n     resisted too feebly, and our diplomacy betrayed an extremely\r\n     poor comprehension of Russian problems. Austria's snatching\r\n     appetite was fully revealed in the formula of partition of\r\n     the Peninsula into two spheres of influence: Austria was to\r\n     have Serbia and Bosnia, Russia the Bulgarian provinces of\r\n     the Ottoman Empire. We all know how that ended: Serbia was\r\n     abandoned by Russia at the Berlin Congress, and had no\r\n     choice but to throw herself into the arms of Austria, which\r\n     wrought fearful demoralization in the land. Tens of years\r\n     were required before little, tormented Serbia--which had\r\n     not, nevertheless, lost her freshness of spiritual power\r\n     \"found herself,\" that is to say, turned again to Russia, and\r\n     did not reject her even during the period of the\r\n     persecutions of 1908 which followed. This constituted the\r\n     great service rendered to his people by the King of Serbia,\r\n     Peter. Serbia has not perished, has not fallen into ruin,\r\n     and has shown herself able to endure a war with Turkey, as\r\n     she is now bearing the incredible blows of Austria-Hungary.\r\n     But Bulgaria, which rejected Russia, has been seized in the\r\n     grip of internal disturbances; she stands distracted before\r\n     her Slavonic duty, and knows not whither she must go or why.\r\n     If, at the last moment, she has sufficient sense to find her\r\n     only way of salvation, which is in friendship with Slavdom,\r\n     that, again, will be to the credit of Russia.\r\n\r\n     That is why, at the present moment, when the last act of the\r\n     Balkan tragedy, begun long ago, is being played, we can look\r\n     history in the face with calm eyes. Whatever may be formed\r\n     after the end of this war, whether a Slavonic Federation, in\r\n     which Russia could hardly take much interest, since she\r\n     requires, first of all, the concentration of her own forces,\r\n     or a series of independent, separate Slavonic kingdoms, we\r\n     may say that, in having summoned the Slavs to unity, Russia\r\n     has not deceived them, has not led them along a false road\r\n     to destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nItaly's Publications in War-Time\r\n\r\nAbsolutely nothing is published in the Italian papers or reviews\r\nconcerning military or naval operations until the result of a given\r\nmovement is known. Meanwhile, what are Italians reading and what is\r\nthe intellectual food given them to sustain the wonderful sentimental\r\nenthusiasm with which they welcomed the war?\r\n\r\nPrevious to Italy's declaration of war against Austria-Hungary, on May\r\n24, the press in general dealt with the negotiations between the two\r\nGovernments from the point of view of domestic politics, which gave\r\nforeigners the impression that Italy was only waiting to receive her\r\nprice to remain neutral until the end of the war. Austrian intrigue\r\nand dilatoriness were alike criticized. Little was said about Germany\r\nin regard to Italy, although her military methods in Belgium and\r\nnorthern France, her raids on the defenseless coast towns of England,\r\nand her submarine activities in the War Zone were severely condemned.\r\nThis censure, however, was entirely academic and objective. The\r\nreviews republished a quantity of English, French, Russian, and even\r\nAmerican articles as to the causes of the war, and the illustrations\r\nwhich accompanied them could hardly be considered pro-Teutonic. Only\r\nthe comic press--and this in spite of its augmenting circulation which\r\nshould have indicated to observers the sentiment that was elsewhere\r\nsuppressed--gave full vent to popular emotion.\r\n\r\nThe moment war was declared there was a complete change. To be sure\r\nthe \"Green Book\" was published in numerous 20-cent editions and sold\r\nby the hundreds of thousands and the closing speeches of Italian and\r\nAustrian diplomats were given in full with comments, yet little time\r\nwas wasted with explanations of the failure of the Italo-Austrian\r\nnegotiations and the meaning of the Seventh Article of the Triple\r\nAlliance. The daily press, the weekly periodicals, and the monthly\r\nreviews suddenly changed their objective expositions of Germany's\r\nconduct in regard to others and began to expound, explain, and\r\nelucidate, in an intimate subjective manner, how that conduct affected\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nAustria was almost ignored. The anti-German riots at Milan and other\r\ncities, where thousands of dollars worth of property was\r\nsystematically destroyed before the authorities could interfere,\r\nshowed the volcano that had been lying dormant beneath the surface.\r\nArticles which must have been prepared months before suddenly appeared\r\nin the press and reviews showing how Germany had come to control the\r\nbanks and steamship lines of the Peninsula and how German capital,\r\nunder the guise of promoting Italian enterprises, had laid hold of\r\nvast industries whose profits went to fill the pockets of the Germans;\r\nand, worst of all, how the savings of Italian immigrants in America\r\nhad gone, through the German-conducted banks, to enrich the same\r\npersons without any contingent benefit to Italians.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it almost seemed as though the press and reviews alike had\r\nbeen organized as completely as had the army and navy for the\r\nprosecution of the war with the sole object in view of preventing\r\nGermany ever again from using the Peninsula as a territory for\r\nexploitation. The propaganda for _Italia Irredenta_ suddenly sank into\r\ninsignificance beside the determination to throw off, once and for\r\nall, the German commercial, industrial, and financial yoke, revealing\r\nthe abiding faith of the Italian people that their army would attend\r\nto the former as completely as desirable and without the advice and\r\ncriticism of civilians. Faith in their King and their army and in\r\ntheir ultimate success is not a matter for argument among Italians.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the staffs of all publications, from editors to\r\ncompositors, have felt the weight of conscription--sacrifices they\r\nenthusiastically make for the common cause. Their pages may be fewer\r\nand some favorite contributors may be heard of no more, but they are\r\nsure that the public will bear with them. On the other hand, a new\r\nperiodical has sprung into existence called La Guerra d'Italia nel\r\n1915--The Italian War of 1915--the first number of which has just come\r\nto hand. Its introduction accompanied with several well-made portraits\r\nconstructs the basis of Italy's action--how Italy having been tricked\r\nthrough a fancied fear of France and the apparent unresponsiveness of\r\nEngland into entering the Triple Alliance in 1882, had been forced to\r\nremain there, possibly protected thereby from actual Austrian\r\naggression, but ever a prey to German exploitation. Then comes an\r\nanalysis of the Italo-Austrian negotiations, conducted directly and\r\nthrough Prince von Buelow, the Special German Ambassador in Rome,\r\nshowing why these negotiations could not possibly have succeeded. Like\r\nthe Government itself the new periodical is in no haste to describe\r\nmilitary operations.\r\n\r\nThe first review to devote almost its entire space to the war was La\r\nVita Internazionale of Milan. The opening article is by the well-known\r\npublicist E.T. Moneta. He begins:\r\n\r\n     Without boast but with self-esteem secure, Italy has taken\r\n     her place in the combat among the nations which for ten\r\n     months have been fighting for the liberty of the people and\r\n     the cause of civilization. The enthusiasm with which this\r\n     announcement has been received in France, Russia, and\r\n     England, and especially in martyred Belgium, is enormous.\r\n     For they have all understood what decisive effect our army\r\n     would produce on the destiny of the Great War.\r\n\r\n     The fighters for liberty and civilization who have always\r\n     hoped for an ultimate victory, today feel the certainty of\r\n     that hope, and that the duration of the war with the loss of\r\n     millions of other lives will be shortened. For this reason,\r\n     from those governments and people, from their parliaments\r\n     and from their press, from workingmen's societies and from\r\n     institutions of learning there have come to our country warm\r\n     words of admiration and of social unity. All these things\r\n     form an added inspiration for us to do our best to hasten\r\n     the end of this slaughter of men.\r\n\r\nSignor Moneta goes on to compliment the diplomacy of Premier Salandra\r\nfor resigning from office and thus giving the people the opportunity\r\nto show through their demonstrations that they desired war and to\r\nsilence once and forever the propaganda of Giolitti who had declaimed\r\nin vain that the people did not want war, as they could secure by\r\nnegotiations unredeemed Italy--as though that were all.\r\n\r\nAnother article is by D. Giuseppe Antonini and is entitled \"The German\r\nMadness.\" Its subject, full of quotations from Treitschke, Nietzsche,\r\nand Bernhardi, is not new to Americans. For Italians it may come as a\r\nrevelation. It demonstrates the formative influences which have found\r\nexpression in what is called \"Prussian Militarism,\" as an attitude of\r\nmind which believes in the supremacy of force over all things--over\r\ngoodness, virtue, kindness, and all else that make life worth living.\r\nIt declares that Prussian Militarism has so possessed all Germans that\r\nnot only their moral but their logical point of view has become\r\ndistorted, so that they behold nought but virtue in applying science\r\nto bring about Mediaeval results. The conflict, he declares, is\r\nbetween absolutism which pretends to be sufficient unto itself and\r\ndemocracy which receives its power from the people, and that the\r\nlatter must win unless centuries of the power, by revolutions without\r\nnumber, for the benefit of the masses are to end in failure.\r\n\r\nPaolo Baccari deals with \"The Supreme Duty.\" He says that the\r\nintervention of Italy was not merely to complete Unification by\r\nuniting all Italians of the Peninsula and the Adriatic littoral under\r\none flag and government, but to register herself as standing for\r\njustice, law, and humanity against organized barbarity, injustice,\r\nillegality, and inhumanity, which, if victorious, would not rest until\r\nit had conquered the world. He calls the peace propaganda at this time\r\na \"vile lie of conventionality\" because its success could only mean\r\nthe victory of those forces which all honest nationalities and persons\r\ncondemn.\r\n\r\nAs to the other serious reviews, such as the Nuova Antologia and the\r\nRivista d'Italia, their June numbers, aside from expounding Italy's\r\nrelations to Germany, have not gone beyond academic discussion of the\r\ncauses of the war and the economic phases as revealed by the budgets\r\nof France, England, and Russia, and the sacrifices that Italy must\r\nendure in order to make her a worthy ally of these countries, all\r\nputting forth their greatest efforts in the battle for the world's\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\nThere are in Italy a large number of popular, well illustrated,\r\nmonthly magazines, which, taking it for granted that their readers\r\nhave already been thoroughly instructed as to the diplomatic phases of\r\nthe war, have started a campaign of education in regard to the war\r\nitself. There are articles contrasting the armies of the days of\r\nGaribaldi and the great King Victor Emmanuel with those of the\r\npresent. There are also articles, historical and descriptive,\r\nsociological and economic, on Trieste, Trent, and other cities of\r\nUnredeemed Italy, and historical monographs showing the bonds that\r\nformerly bound Italy to England and to France which have now been\r\ncemented anew, free from all Teutonic influence.\r\n\r\nAmong the magazines of this class are the Secolo XX, the Noi e il\r\nMondo, and La Lettura; all, whenever the occasion offers, deal\r\ngenerously and enthusiastically with Italy's allies.\r\n\r\nIn all this published matter one thing has been revealed since Italy\r\nentered the war. Previously all the Italian writers placed in the same\r\ncategory of contempt the alleged attempts that were being made to\r\ninfluence Italy by the Central Empires as well as by the Entente\r\nPowers and unblushingly declared that if Italy ever entered the war it\r\nwould not be for the benefit of one party or the other but for the\r\nbenefit of herself alone. Now they frankly confess that the Entente\r\nPowers made no attempt to influence Italy, knowing all the time that\r\nwhen she was ready she would line up on their side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSweden and the Lusitania\r\n\r\nBy SWEDISH ARTISTS AND PROFESSORS\r\n\r\n\r\nStockholm, May 10, 1915.\r\n\r\nEnglish people know that the Swedish nation is practically unanimous\r\nin supporting the Government in its policy of strict neutrality. Yet a\r\nlarge section of the people, whether the majority or not we cannot\r\nsay, is anything but neutral in their feelings at the methods of\r\nwarfare which have been adopted in this terrible war, and have\r\nculminated in the sinking of the Lusitania.\r\n\r\nThe misconception that war suspends all laws of humanity must prove\r\nfatal to the future of civilization and disastrous for that human\r\nsolidarity that is of such vital interest to the smaller nations\r\nespecially.\r\n\r\n(Signed)\r\n\r\nSVANTE ARRHENIUS, Professor.\r\nBARON ADELSWARD.\r\nVICTOR ALMQUIST, Chief Director for State Prisons.\r\nW.

If the\r\npeople that are spending their thousands so freely had come out\r\nfrankly and stated that they were pro-German, and that the success of\r\ntheir propaganda would mean defeat for the Allies, short of\r\nammunition, and victory for a nation that has nine-tenths of all the\r\nammunition in Europe, then at least we should have the sheep separated\r\nfrom the goats; we could put it down to masculine influence over the\r\nweaker female vessel, which at least was trying to be honest, and let\r\nit go at that.\r\n\r\nBut I hold that such a poster, flaring from every billboard, is a\r\ndefamation of patriotic American women, and a distinct blow to the\r\ncause of suffrage. It will not only antagonize men, who alone have the\r\npower to grant the franchise in those States still obdurate, but\r\ndisgust thousands of women not yet won over to the cause, and far too\r\nintelligent not to know the precise meaning behind those lying and\r\nhypocritical words. For if that poster were really representative of\r\nAmerican women it would mean that American women were traitors to\r\ntheir country, just as all pro-German American men, whatever their\r\ndescent, are traitors, whether they realize it or not. What was the\r\ncause of the roar of indignation that went up all over the United\r\nStates on Aug. 1? Anti-Germanism? Not a bit of it. If Russia had made\r\nthe declaration of war the roar would have been as immediate and as\r\nloud. It was the spontaneous protest of the spirit of democracy\r\nagainst an arrogant autocracy that dared to plunge Europe into war and\r\nthe world into panic, without the consent of the people; the manifest\r\nof a mediaeval power by an ambitious and unscrupulous group over\r\nmillions of industrious, peace-loving men who had nothing to gain and\r\nall to lose.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out over and over again how diametrically opposed\r\nare the German and American ideals; therefore, it seems incredible\r\nthat every American who champions the cause of a powerful and\r\nsublimely egotistic nation does not realize that what he hopes to see\r\nis not only the victory of the German arms in Europe, but the eventual\r\ndestruction of democracy, the annihilation of the spirit of America as\r\nepitomized in the Declaration of Independence. I have not the least\r\napprehension of immediate war with Germany, any more than of physical\r\ndefeat at her hands did she, with the rest of Europe prostrate, make a\r\nraid on our shores; but it seems hardly open to question that with\r\nEurope Prussianized, we, the one heterogeneous race, and always ready\r\nto absorb and imbibe from the parent countries, should lose, in the\r\ncourse of half a century, our tremendous individual hustle, and\r\ngratefully permit a benevolent (and cast iron) despotism (not\r\nunnecessarily of our own make) to do our thinking, perhaps to select\r\nour jobs and apportion our daily tasks.\r\n\r\nFor that is what it almost amounts to now in Germany, and it is for\r\nthis reason, no less than to escape military service, that so many\r\nmillions of Germans have immigrated to this country. Unlike the vast\r\nmajority of the bourgeois and lower classes, a kindly but stupid\r\npeople, they were born with an alertness of mind and an energy of\r\ncharacter which gave them the impetus to transfer themselves to a land\r\nwhere life might be harder but where soul and body could attain to a\r\ncomplete independence. Their present attitude is, however\r\nunconsciously, hypocritical, but it is not altogether as traitorous as\r\nthat of the American born, who has not the excuse of that peculiar\r\nform of sentimentality which has fermented in Germans at home and\r\nabroad during this period of their Fatherland's peril. It is this\r\ncurious and wholly German brand of sentimentality which is the\r\ncohering force in the various and extraordinarily clever devices by\r\nwhich modern Germany has been solidified. It is a sentimentality\r\ncapable of rising to real exaltation that no other nation is capable\r\nof, and that alone should make the American pro-German pause and\r\nmeditate upon a future United States where native individualism was\r\nless and less reluctantly heading for the iron jaws of the\r\nPrussianized American machine; and, furthermore, upon the weird\r\nspectacle of the real gladiatorial contest--German sentimentality\r\nwrestling in a death grapple with American downright unpicturesque\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\nDuring the seven years that I lived in Munich I learned to like\r\nGermany better than any state in Europe. I liked and admired the\r\nGerman people; I never suffered from an act of rudeness, and I never\r\nwas cheated out of a penny. I was not even taxed until the year before\r\nI left, because I made no money out of the country and turned in a\r\nconsiderable amount in the course of a year. When my maid went to the\r\nRathaus to pay my taxes, (moderate enough,) the official apologized,\r\nsaying that he had disliked to send me a bill, but the increased cost\r\nof the army compelled the country to raise money in every way\r\npossible. This was in 1908. The only disagreeable German I met during\r\nall those years was my landlord, and as we always dodged each other in\r\nthe house or turned an abrupt corner to avoid encounter on the street,\r\nwe steered clear of friction. And he was the only landlord I had.\r\n\r\nI left Munich with the greatest regret, and up to the moment of the\r\ndeclaration of war I continued to like Germany better than any country\r\nin the world except my own.\r\n\r\nThe reason I left was significant. I spent, as a rule, seven or eight\r\nmonths in Munich, then a similar period in the United States, unless I\r\ntraveled. I always returned to my apartment with such joy that if I\r\narrived at night I did not go to bed lest I forget in sleep how\r\noverjoyed I was to get back to that stately and picturesque city, so\r\nprodigal with every form of artistic and aesthetic gratification. But\r\nthat was just the trouble. For as long a time after my return as it\r\ntook to write the book I had in mind I worked with the stored American\r\nenergy I had within me; then for months and in spite of good\r\nresolutions and some self-anathema I did nothing. What was the use?\r\nThe beautiful German city so full of artistic delight was made to live\r\nin, not to work in. The entire absence of poverty in that city of half\r\na million inhabitants alone gave it an air of illusion, gave one the\r\nsense of being the guest of a hospitable monarch who only asked to\r\nprovide a banquet for all that could appreciate. I look back upon\r\nMunich as the romance of my life, the only place on this globe that\r\ncame near to satisfying every want of my nature. And that is the\r\nreason why, in a sort of panic, I abruptly pulled up stakes and left\r\nit for good and all. It is not in the true American idea to be too\r\ncontent; it means running to seed, a weakening of the will and the\r\nvital force. If I remained too long in that lovely land--so admirably\r\ngoverned that I could not have lost myself, or my cat, had I possessed\r\none--I should in no long course yield utterly to a certain resentfully\r\nadmitted tendency to dream and drift and live for pure beauty;\r\nfinally desert my own country with the comfortable reflection: Why all\r\nthis bustle, this desire to excel, to keep in the front rank, to find\r\npleasure in individual work, when so many artistic achievements are\r\nready-made for all to enjoy without effort? For--here is the point--an\r\nAmerican, the American of today--accustomed to high speed, constant\r\nenergy, nervous tenseness, the uncertainty, and the fight, cannot\r\ncultivate the leisurely German method, the almost scientific and\r\nimpersonal spirit that informs every profession and branch of art. It\r\nis our own way or none for us Americans.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if loving Germany as I did, and with only the most\r\nenchanting memories of her, I had not immediately permitted the\r\nAmerican spirit to assert itself last August and taken a hostile and\r\ndefinite stand against the German idea (which includes, by the way,\r\nthe permanent subjection of woman) I should have been a traitor, for I\r\nknew out of the menace I had felt to my own future, as bound up with\r\nan assured development under insidious influences, what the future of\r\nmy country, which stands for the only true progress in the world\r\ntoday, and a far higher ideal of mortal happiness than the most\r\nbenevolent paternalism can bestow, had in store for it, with Germany\r\nvictorious, and America (always profoundly moved by success owing to\r\nher very practicality) disturbed, but compelled to admire.\r\n\r\nThe Germans living here, destitute as their race seems to be of\r\npsychology when it comes to judging other races, must know all this;\r\nso I say that they are traitors if they have taken the oath of\r\nallegiance to the United States. If they have not, and dream of\r\nreturning one day to the fatherland, then I have nothing to say, for\r\nthere is no better motto for any man than: \"My country, right or\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Gott Mit Uns\"\r\n\r\nBy C.

But the joint\r\n     work was brought to a sudden end by Prince Hohenlohe's\r\n     death, and Friedrich Curtius devoted himself, for the next\r\n     six or seven years, to the completion of the unfinished\r\n     task. When the _Memoirs_ were finally published, first in\r\n     America and then in Germany, they were so outspoken as to\r\n     bring down on Prince Alexander Hohenlohe and Friedrich\r\n     Curtius the disfavour of the Kaiser. This article by Curtius\r\n     appeared originally in the Deutsche Revue, May, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_All the world must hate or love; no choice remains. The Devil is\r\nneutral._\"\r\n\r\nSo sang Clemens Brentano in the year 1813. Today, we once more realize\r\nthat the attempt to remain neutral through a conflict which is\r\ndeciding the history of the world not only brings great spiritual\r\ndifficulties, but is even felt to be a downright moral impossibility,\r\njust as the poet saw it a hundred years ago. Legal neutrality is, of\r\ncourse, a simple thing. Every state can itself practice it, and impose\r\nit as a duty on its citizens. One may even think that modern states\r\nshould go further in this direction than they do. The indifference of\r\nthe Government toward the business transactions of its citizens with\r\nforeign states is a political anomaly, comprehensible in an age when\r\nforeign policy in war and peace was viewed as something that concerned\r\nthe ruler only, but contradictory in a democratic age, when wars are\r\npeoples' wars. Today, in all civilized states, the Government is\r\nmorally answerable for those activities of its subjects which have\r\ninternational results. The American policy which permits the supply of\r\nweapons to England but allows England to prevent the export of grain\r\nto Germany, is a bad neutrality, morally untenable, a mere passivity,\r\nwhich lacks the will to do right. Such a standpoint might exist in a\r\ndespotically governed state, but in a democratic Republic it is\r\nincomprehensible. For, from a genuinely democratic point of view, it\r\ndoes not signify whether the government or the citizens intervene to\r\nhelp or to hinder in an armed conflict. If we venture to speak at the\r\nright time of the development of international law, this, before all,\r\nmust be demanded: that neutral states shall forbid the export of\r\nweapons, and that belligerents shall not hinder the import of\r\nfoodstuffs for civilian populations.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the insecurity of the international attitude of neutrals is\r\nonly a symptom of the difficulties to which neutrality of view is\r\nsubject. These begin with the outbreak of the war. Each belligerent\r\ngovernment believes itself to be in the right, and publishes a\r\ncollection of documents which seem to it fitted to prove this right.\r\nThis literature appearing in all the colours of the spectrum is really\r\naimed at neutrals. For the belligerent nations themselves have\r\nweightier matters in hand than to sit in judgment upon their own\r\ngovernments. But the neutrals find themselves to decide which side is\r\nright. Yet this whole idea of a \"just war\" (coming to us from the\r\nmoral philosophy of the Schoolmen) which shall expiate an injustice,\r\nas the judge punishes crimes, is antiquated. When, in the middle ages,\r\nthe citizens of a town were maltreated or robbed by the authorities or\r\ncitizens of another town, and the guilty party refused satisfaction,\r\nthen the consequent feud might be viewed as a modified criminal case,\r\nand the right of the wronged town to help itself must be recognized.\r\nIn exactly the same way, differences over questions of inheritance\r\nbetween independent states could only be decided by force, where, as\r\nin a civil suit, each party was convinced of its own justice. But the\r\ngreat wars of our time arise from causes which are different from\r\ntheir immediate occasions, from opposed interests which can only be\r\ndecided by discovering which side has the power to enforce its will.\r\nIf one wishes to ascribe the blame for a war to one of the parties,\r\none need only ask which of them pursued an aim which could not be\r\nreached through a peaceful understanding. In the present war, we\r\nGermans have clear consciences, for we know, concerning ourselves and\r\nour government, that we strove for nothing but the maintenance of our\r\nposition as a world-power, bought with heavy sacrifices, and the free,\r\npeaceful expansion of our sphere of action in the world. On the other\r\nhand, Russia desired to get to Constantinople ahead of Berlin and\r\nVienna, France desired to win back Metz and Strassburg, England\r\ndesired to destroy our sea-power and commerce--goals which could only\r\nbe reached over prostrate Germany. On this understanding, it would not\r\nbe difficult for neutrals to arrive at a clear and just judgment. But\r\nas the belligerents themselves did not announce their purposes, but\r\nmuch rather took pains to turn public attention from the causes to the\r\noccasion of the conflict, the judgment of neutrals is affected by\r\nthis, and if they are really impartial in their view, they suffer\r\nmorally under the burden of an insoluble problem. But if outspoken\r\nsympathy draws them toward one of the belligerent powers, then their\r\njudgment is as little objective as that of the belligerents\r\nthemselves. Their pretended neutrality gives to their expressions a\r\nloathsome Pharisaical aspect, because they come to a decision\r\naccording to their opinions as if they stood on a height above the\r\ncontestants and, from this lofty standpoint, were holding an\r\nanticipated Last Judgment on kings and statesmen.\r\n\r\nThe same phenomena show themselves with regard to judgments concerning\r\nmethods of warfare. It goes without saying that each belligerent party\r\nreports all the atrocities which are committed by its opponents and is\r\nsilent as to its own shortcomings. Once more, neutrals feel compelled\r\nto form a judgment, and therefore, if they are conscientious, read the\r\nreports of both sides, and, as a result, find themselves in a\r\ndesperate situation, because it is impossible, from the assertions and\r\ncounter-assertions of the belligerents, to ascertain the actual facts\r\nof the case. In practice, mere chance decides which set of reports one\r\ncomes across. And the exact proof of details is impossible to the most\r\nzealous newspaper-reader. Therefore one's judgment remains\r\nvacillating, and one is likely to come to this conclusion: to believe\r\nnothing at all. Naturally, the case is different here also, if one is\r\npreviously in sympathy with one party. Then one believes the reports\r\ncoming from that side, and leaves out of consideration those that\r\nstand against them. In this case, again, neutrals become as one-sided\r\nas belligerents, without having the indubitable right to be one-sided\r\nwhich the belligerents have.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, in the decisive question, neutrality is excluded.\r\nWhatever judgments one may form as to the cause of the war, and as to\r\nmethods of waging it, the final outcome is always the decisive factor.\r\nOnly a completely demoralized and stupid man can boast, in cynical\r\nindifference, that the result of the war leaves him cold. Where\r\nspiritual life functions, wishes and prayers, hopes and fears, are\r\npassionately involved in the course of the mighty conflict. For it is\r\nnot a question whether this or that nation shall experience more\r\npleasure or pain, but the form of all Europe and of the world, for\r\nlong periods to come, will be fixed by the decision of this war. That\r\ncannot be a matter of indifference for any thinking human being. An\r\nequilibrium of view, a real neutrality is as little possible here as\r\nit would have been in the Persian or Punic wars, or, a hundred years\r\nago, in the revolt of Europe, against the domination of Napoleon. He\r\nwho, invoking the neutrality of his state, does not takes sides in\r\nthis decisive question, debases himself and his people with him. For\r\nto stand indifferent, taking no part in the mightiest events of\r\nhistory, is a degradation of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe neutrals in this world-war are, therefore, to be pitied rather\r\nthan esteemed happy. Either they are only legally uncommitted, but\r\nhave, in feeling and thought, taken the side of one of the belligerent\r\nparties: in which case it must weigh heavily on their hearts not to be\r\nable to come out openly for that side and to aid it with all their\r\npower; or they hold to neutrality as a positive political ideal: then\r\nthe ethical solution of the dark questions of the right and wrong of\r\nthe war, and the methods of warfare become a torturing and hopeless\r\nproblem, and, in considering the future, the weakness and\r\nimpracticability of what one has accepted as a legal precept becomes\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nIf the world-war should last much longer, then neutrality, as such,\r\nwill probably go bankrupt. The economic injuries of the war weigh on\r\nneutrals as heavily as on belligerents. But they are far harder to\r\nbear when one has nothing to hope from the outcome of the war, when\r\none must make continued sacrifices in sheer passivity, without knowing\r\nwhy. One would finally fall into despair, and accept anything that\r\nwould bring this intolerable condition to an end. We hope that this\r\nextremity will not be reached, but rather that the decision of the war\r\nwill come early enough to permit neutrals to preserve their attitude.\r\nThat this should happen, is the common interest of mankind. For, in\r\nthe collective life of civilized nations, neutrals have their own\r\nmission. Just because they share only the sufferings of the war, but\r\ndo not partake of its inspiring and exalting forces, they are, of\r\nnecessity, opponents of war, the providential mediators of the idea of\r\npeace, of international understanding, of the development and\r\nstrengthening of international law. They can, during and after the\r\nconclusion of peace--if they unite and go forward with clearly formed\r\nideals--have a notable effect. It will, in part, depend on their\r\nwisdom and firmness, whether it will be possible, within a conceivable\r\ntime, to heal the deep wounds of humanity and international comity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChlorine Warfare\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Reuter dispatch, dated Amsterdam, June 26, 1915, reports that the\r\n\"Koelnische Zeitung,\" in a semi-official defence of the German\r\nemployment of gases, says:_\r\n\r\n\"The basic idea of the Hague agreements was to prevent unnecessary\r\ncruelty and unnecessary killing when milder methods of putting the\r\nenemy out of action suffice and are possible. From this standpoint the\r\nletting loose of smoke-clouds which, in a gentle wind, move quite\r\nslowly towards the enemy is not only permissible by international law,\r\nbut is an extraordinarily mild method of war. It has always been\r\npermissible to compel the enemy to evacuate positions by artificially\r\ncaused flooding.\r\n\r\n\"Those who were not indignant, or even surprised, when our enemies in\r\nFlanders summoned water as a weapon against us, have no cause to be\r\nindignant when we make air our ally and employ it to carry stupefying\r\n(_betaeubende_) gases against the enemy. What the Hague Convention\r\ndesired to prevent was the destruction without chance of escape of\r\nhuman lives _en masse_, which would have been the case if shells with\r\npoisonous gas were rained down on a defenceless enemy who did not see\r\nthem coming and was exposed to them irremediably. The changing forms\r\nof warfare make new methods of war continually necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRheims Cathedral\r\n\r\nBy Pierre Loti\r\n\r\n     This article by Pierre Loti (Captain Viaud) originally\r\n     appeared in L'Illustration as the last of a series of three\r\n     entitled \"Visions of the Battle Front,\" and is translated\r\n     for THE NEW YORK TIMES CURRENT HISTORY by Charles Johnston.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see it, our legendary and marvellous French basilica, to bid it\r\nfarewell, before its fall and irremediable crumbling to dust, I had\r\nmade my military auto make a detour of two hours on my return from\r\ncompleting a service mission.\r\n\r\nThe October morning was foggy and cold. The hillsides of Champagne\r\nwere on that day deserted; with their vines with leaves of blackened\r\nbrown, damp with rain, they seemed all clad in a sort of shining\r\nleather. We had also passed through a forest, keeping our eyes alert,\r\nour weapons ready, for the possibility of marauding Uhlans. And at\r\nlast we had perceived the immense form of a church, far off in the\r\nmist, rising in all its great height above the plots of reddish\r\nsquares, which must be the roofs of houses; evidently that was it.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to Rheims: defences of every kind, barriers of stone,\r\ntrenches, spiked fences, sentinels with crossed bayonets. To pass, the\r\nuniform and accoutrements of a soldier are not enough. We must answer\r\nquestions, give the pass-words....\r\n\r\nIn the great city, which I had not visited before, I ask the way to\r\nthe cathedral, for it is no longer visible; its silhouette which, seen\r\nfrom a distance, so completely dominates everything, as a giant's\r\ncastle might dominate the dwellings of dwarfs, its high gray\r\nsilhouette seems to have bent down to hide itself. \"The cathedral,\"\r\nthe people reply, \"at first straight on; then you must turn to the\r\nleft, then to the right, and so on.\" And my auto plunges into the\r\ncrowded streets. Many soldiers, regiments on the march, files of\r\nambulance wagons; but also many chance passers-by, no more concerned\r\nthan if nothing was happening; even many well-dressed women with\r\nprayer-books in their hands, for it is Sunday.\r\n\r\nWhere two streets cross, there is a crowd before a house, the walls of\r\nwhich have been freshly scratched; a shell fell there, just now,\r\nwithout any useful result, as without any excuse. A mere brutal jest,\r\nto say: \"You know, we are here!\" A mere game, a question of killing a\r\nfew people, choosing Sunday morning because there are more people in\r\nthe streets. But, in truth, one would say that this city has\r\ncompletely made up its mind to being under the savage field-glasses\r\nambushed on the neighboring hillsides; these passers-by stop a minute\r\nto look at the wall, the marks of the bits of iron, and then quietly\r\ncontinue their Sunday walk. This time it was some women, they tell us,\r\nand little girls that this neat jest laid low in pools of blood; they\r\ntell us that; and they think no more of it, as if it were a very small\r\nthing in days like these.... Now the district becomes deserted; closed\r\nhouses, a silence, as of mourning. And at the end of a street, the\r\ngreat gray doors appear, the high pointed arches marvellously\r\nchiseled, the high towers. Not a sound, and not a living soul on the\r\nsquare where the phantom basilica still sits enthroned, and an icy\r\nwind blows there, under an opaque sky.\r\n\r\nIt still keeps its place as by a miracle, the basilica of Rheims, but\r\nso riddled and torn that one divines that it is ready to founder at\r\nthe slightest shock; it gives the impression of a great mummy, still\r\nupright and majestic, but which a mere nothing will turn to ashes. The\r\nground is strewn with precious relics of it. It has been hurriedly\r\nsurrounded with a solid barrier of white boards, within which its\r\nholy dust has formed heaps: fragments of rose-windows, broken piles of\r\nstained glass, heads of angels, the joined hands of saints. From the\r\ntop of the tower to the base, the charred stone has taken on a strange\r\ncolor of cooked flesh, and the holy personages, still upright in rows\r\non the cornices, have been peeled, as it were, by the fire; they no\r\nlonger have faces or fingers, and, with their human forms, which still\r\npersist, they look like the dead drawn up in files, their contours\r\nvaguely indicated under a sort of reddish grave-clothes.\r\n\r\nWe make the circuit of the square without meeting anyone, and the\r\nbarrier which isolates the fragile and still admirable phantom is\r\neverywhere solidly closed. As for the old palace adjoining the\r\nbasilica, the episcopal palace where the kings of France came to rest\r\non the day of their consecration, it is no longer anything more than a\r\nruin, without windows or roof, everywhere licked and blackened by the\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nWhat a peerless jewel it was, this cathedral, still more beautiful\r\nthan Notre Dame in Paris. More open and lighter, more slender also,\r\nwith its columns like long reeds, wonderful to be so fragile, and yet\r\nto hold firm; a wonder of our French religious art, a masterpiece\r\nwhich the faith of our ancestors had caused to blossom there in its\r\nmystic purity, before they came to us from Italy, to materialize and\r\nspoil everything, the sensual heaviness of what we have agreed to call\r\nthe Renaissance....\r\n\r\nOh! the coarse and cowardly and imbecile brutality of those bundles of\r\niron, launched in full flight against the lace-work, so delicate, that\r\nhad risen confidently in the air for centuries, and which so many\r\nbattles, invasions, scourges have never dared to touch!...\r\n\r\nThat great closed house, there, on the square, must be the\r\nArchbishop's residence. I try ringing the bell at the entrance to ask\r\nthe favor of admission to the cathedral. \"His Eminence,\" I am told,\r\n\"is at mass, but will soon return.\" If I am willing to wait.... And,\r\nwhile I wait, the priest who receives me relates to me the burning of\r\nthe episcopal palace: \"Beforehand, they had sprinkled the roofs with I\r\nknow not what diabolical substance; when they then threw their\r\nincendiary bombs, the timbers burned like straw, and you saw\r\neverywhere jets of green flame, which spread with the noise of\r\nfireworks.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the barbarians had premeditated this sacrilege, and prepared\r\nit long ago; in spite of their foolishly absurd pretexts, in spite of\r\ntheir shameless denials, what they wished to destroy here was the very\r\nheart of old France; some superstitious fancy drove them to it, as\r\nmuch as their instinct of savages, and this is the task they plunged\r\ninto desperately, when nothing else in the city, or almost nothing,\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\n\"Could not an effort be made,\" I said, \"to replace the burned roof of\r\nthe cathedral?--to cover the vaulted roofs again as quickly as\r\npossible? For without this they cannot resist the coming winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Evidently,\" he said, \"at the first snows, at the first rains, there\r\nis a risk that everything will fall, the more so, as those charred\r\nstones have lost their power of resistance. But we cannot even try\r\nthat, to preserve them a little, for the Germans never take their eyes\r\noff us; at the end of their field-glasses, it is the cathedral, always\r\nthe cathedral; and as soon as a man ventures to appear on a turret, in\r\na tower, the rain of shells immediately begins again. No, there is\r\nnothing to be done. It is in the hands of God.\"\r\n\r\nReturning, the prelate graciously gives me a guide, who has the keys\r\nof the barrier, and at last I penetrate into the ruins of the\r\ncathedral, into the denuded nave, which thus appears still higher and\r\nmore immense. It is cold there; it is sad enough to make one weep.\r\nThis unexpected cold, this cold much keener than outside, is, perhaps,\r\nwhat from the first takes hold of you, disconcerts you; instead of the\r\nslightly heavy odor which generally fills ancient churches--the vapor\r\nof so much incense that has been burned there, the emanations of so\r\nmany coffins that have been blessed there, of so many generations of\r\nmen that have crowded there, for agony and prayer--instead of this, a\r\ndamp and icy wind, which enters rustling through all the crevices of\r\nthe walls, through the breaches in the stained glass windows and the\r\nholes in the vaulted ceilings. Those vaulted roofs, up there, here and\r\nthere smashed by grapeshot--one's eyes are immediately lifted up by\r\ninstinct to look at them, one's eyes are, as it were, drawn to them by\r\nthe up-springing of all these columns, as slender as reeds, which rise\r\nin sheaves to sustain them; they have retreating curves of exquisite\r\ngrace, which seem to have been imagined, so as not to allow the\r\nglances sent heavenward to fall back again. One never grows weary of\r\nbending one's head back in order to see them, to see the sacred roofs\r\nwhich are about to fall into nothingness; and they are up there also,\r\nfar up, the long series of almost aerial pointed arches, on which they\r\nare supported, pointed arches indefinitely alike from one end of the\r\nnave to the other, and which, in spite of their complicated carvings,\r\nare restful to follow in their retreating perspective, so harmonious\r\nare they.\r\n\r\nAnd it is better to go forward beneath them with raised head, not too\r\ncarefully looking where one walks, for this pavement, rather sadly\r\nsonorous, has recently been soiled and blackened by the charring of\r\nhuman flesh. It is known that, on the day of the fire, the cathedral\r\nwas full of German wounded, stretched on straw beds which caught fire,\r\nand it became a scene of horror worthy of a dream of Dante; all these\r\ncreatures, whose raw wounds were baked in the flames, dragging\r\nthemselves, screaming, on their red stumps, to try to reach the narrow\r\ndoors. One knows also the heroism of the ambulance bearers, priests\r\nand nuns, risking their lives in the midst of the bombs, to try to\r\nsave these hapless brutes, whom their own brother Germans had not even\r\nthought of sparing; however, they did not succeed in saving them all;\r\nsome remained, and were burned to death in the nave, leaving foul\r\nclots on the sacred flagstones, where of old processions of kings and\r\nqueens slowly dragged their ermine mantles, to the music of the great\r\norgan and the Gregorian chants....\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" says my guide to me, showing me a large hole in one of the\r\naisles, \"that is the work of a shell which they fired at us yesterday\r\nevening; then come and see a miracle.\" And he leads me into the choir,\r\nwhere the statue of Jeanne d'Arc, preserved, one would say, by some\r\nspecial grace, is still there, intact, with eyes of gentle ecstasy.\r\n\r\nThe most irreparable loss is that of the great stained glass windows,\r\nwhich the mysterious artists of the thirteenth century so religiously\r\ncomposed, in meditation and dream, gathering the saints by hundreds,\r\nwith their translucent draperies, their luminous halos. There also\r\nGerman scrap-iron rushed in great stupid bundles, crushing everything.\r\nThe masterpieces, which no one will ever reproduce, have scattered\r\ntheir fragments on the flagstones, forever impossible to separate, the\r\ngolds, the reds, the blues, whose secret is lost. Ended, the rainbow\r\ntransparencies, ended, the graceful, naive attitudes of all these holy\r\npeople, with their pale little ecstatic faces; the thousands of\r\nprecious fragments of these stained glass windows which, in the course\r\nof centuries, had little by little become iris-tinted like opals, are\r\nlying on the ground--where they still shine like jewels....\r\n\r\nA whole splendid cycle of our history, which seemed to go on living in\r\nthis sanctuary, with a life almost terrestrial, though immaterial, has\r\njust been plunged suddenly into the abyss of things that are ended,\r\nwhose very memory will soon perish. The Great Barbarity has passed by,\r\nthe modern barbarism from beyond the Rhine, a thousand times worse\r\nthan the ancient, because it is stupidly and outrageously\r\nself-satisfied, and, in consequence, fundamental, incurable,\r\nfinal--destined, if it be not crushed, to throw a sinister night of\r\neclipse over the world....\r\n\r\nVerily, this Jeanne d'Arc in the choir has very strangely remained,\r\nuntouched, immaculate, in the midst of the disorder, with not even the\r\nslightest scratch on her dress....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English Falsehood\r\n\r\nBy Sven Hedin\r\n\r\n     Early in the war Sven Hedin, the Swedish explorer and\r\n     writer, visited the German front to see the world-war at\r\n     first hand. \"A People in Arms,\" published in Leipzig and\r\n     dedicated to the German soldiers, is the result. A preface\r\n     proclaims the author's neutrality as a Swede and announces\r\n     that he \"swears before God that I have written not a line\r\n     which is not the truth and have depicted nothing which I\r\n     have not witnessed with my own eyes.\" This article is one of\r\n     his concluding sketches.\r\n\r\n\r\nI should like to have seen how the troops of India stood the raw\r\nautumn in Artois and Flanders. But the Indian prisoners at Lille were\r\ntransferred to the East in order to make room for fresh contingents.\r\nI, myself, have experienced the difficulty of transplanting Indians to\r\na colder climate. On my last journey to Tibet I had two Kadschputs\r\nfrom Cashmere with me. When we got into the mountains they nearly\r\nfroze to death, and my caravan leader, Muhamed Isa, declared they\r\nwould be about as useful as puppies. I had to send them back. The same\r\nthing happened to me with my Indian cook; outside India he was\r\nabsolutely useless. In Tibet they live on meat, in India on\r\nvegetables. How could he stand so sudden a change of both climate and\r\ndiet!\r\n\r\nNow the press has been claiming that the English have ordered a full\r\ncontingent from India to Europe. I found it hard to believe but at the\r\nfront I learned that it was true. \"How do you treat the Indian\r\nsoldiers?\" I once asked a couple of officers. \"We just arrest them,\"\r\nanswered one, and the other added: \"We don't need to do even that;\r\nthey will soon die in the trenches.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I admit that I myself made a stupid blunder in thinking that\r\nIndians could do service in Tibet, I am justified in claiming that\r\nLord Charles Beresford made ten times as stupid a blunder when he\r\nexpressed the hope of seeing \"Indian lances roaming the streets of\r\nBerlin and the little brown Gurkas making themselves comfortable in\r\nthe park of Sans Souci.\"\r\n\r\nBut the import of Indian troops is more than a stupid blunder--it is a\r\ncrime!\r\n\r\nFor almost a century and a half Great Britain has performed the\r\nshining mission of acting as India's guardian; no other people\r\nprobably could successfully carry through so gigantic a task. Indian\r\ntroops have fought with honor against their neighbors, and, moreover\r\nhave assisted in maintaining order among the 300 millions of their\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBut never has it occurred to an English government as now to the\r\nLiberal government, to oppose black infidels to Christian Europeans!\r\nThat is a crime against culture, against civilization and against\r\nChristianity. And if the English missionaries approve it, then are\r\nthey hypocrites and false bearers of the Gospel.\r\n\r\nIndia's English rulers despise--and rightfully--all marital relations\r\nbetween whites and Hindoos; the children of such marriages are\r\nregarded as mules, and are often called such; they are neither horse\r\nnor ass, they are half caste. In Calcutta they have their own quarter\r\nand are allowed to live in no other part of the city. But--when it\r\ncomes to the question of overthrowing the \"German barbarians,\" then an\r\nalliance with the bronze-skinned people is good enough for England!\r\n\r\nIs it one of the twentieth century's worthy advances in culture and\r\ncivilization that the unsuspecting Indian is brought hundreds of miles\r\nover land and sea that he may on the battlefields of Europe drive to\r\ndestruction the first soldiers of the world, the German army? Even\r\nthough some may answer this question in the affirmative, I hold\r\nunshaken to my assertion that such a course of action is the very\r\nheight of frightfulness! Not frightful to the German soldiers, for I\r\nknow what sort of feeling the Indian fighters have for them--respect\r\nand sympathy!\r\n\r\nAnd we aren't much nearer that \"roaming about in the streets of\r\nBerlin,\" and the lindens of Sans Souci are not yet waving above the\r\nwarriors from the slopes of the Himalayas.\r\n\r\nWhat must these Indian troops think of their white masters? That the\r\nfuture will show. Whoever has seen something of the land of a thousand\r\nlegends, who has ridden over the crests of the Himalayas, who has\r\ndreamed in the moonlight before the Taj Mahal, who has seen the holy\r\nGanges slip gray and soft past the wharves of Benares, who has been\r\nentranced by the train of elephants under the mango trees of\r\nDekkan--in short, whoever has loved India and admired the order and\r\nsecurity which prevails there under the English rule, he will need no\r\nvery powerful imagination to understand with what thoughts the Indian\r\nsoldiers will go back, and with what feelings their families and their\r\nfellow countrymen in the little narrow huts on the slopes of the\r\nHimalayas will listen to their accounts. Only with a shudder can we\r\nthink of this, for it must be said that here a crime against\r\ncivilization and Christianity has been done in the name of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe question cannot be suppressed: Will the Indian contingent really\r\nbe used? Will not the white millions of Great Britain, Canada and\r\nAustralia suffice, to say nothing of the French, Belgians, Russians,\r\nSerbians, Montenegrins and Japanese? Apparently not. In _The Times_ of\r\nSeptember 5th appears in large letters: The need for more men. Already\r\nthey are in need of more people to overthrow the Kultur of the \"German\r\nbarbarians\"! The English people must be educated by a special method\r\nin order to understand both the cause and the aim of this war.\r\nOtherwise the Englishman will stay at home and play, football and\r\ncricket.\r\n\r\nAnd what is this education of the people? In regard to this the\r\nEnglish press informs us daily. It is a systematic lie! The fatal\r\nreality, that England is slowly sliding to catastrophe, must be hidden\r\nby a strict censorship. The English people has no suspicion of\r\nHindenburg's victories. The development of the German operations in\r\nPoland is translated into a victorious move of the Russians on Berlin!\r\nThe most shameful slander concerning the Kaiser is spread abroad! The\r\nGermans are barbarians who must be annihilated, and the civilized\r\npeoples of Servia, Senegambia and Portugal must take part in this\r\npraiseworthy undertaking!\r\n\r\nEngland carries on this war with a perversion of the truth, and truth\r\nis as rare in the English press as lies in the German.\r\n\r\nBut do the people really believe what they read in the English\r\nnewspapers? Yes, blindly! I have been convinced of this by letters\r\nreceived from England. An appeal signed by many scholars--among them\r\nseveral Nobel prize winners--and sent to me, closes with the words:\r\n\r\n     We regret deeply that under the unwholesome influence of a\r\n     military system and its unrestrained dreams of domination,\r\n     the country which we have once honored now has become\r\n     Europe's common enemy and the enemy of all people who\r\n     respect the rights of nations. We must carry to an end this\r\n     war which we have entered. For us as for the Belgians it is\r\n     a war of defense, which will be fought through for peace and\r\n     freedom.\r\n\r\nThe old story of the splinter and the beam! Is England's rule of the\r\nsea no military system then? Can there be conceived a more\r\nfar-reaching militarism than that which stretches out its conquests\r\nover five continents? Which even clutches at the straw which\r\nrepublican Portugal holds out and announces \"the need for more men\" in\r\nthe newspapers?\r\n\r\nWhat was the Boer War then? An expression perhaps of this same humane\r\nsolicitude for the small states which now causes England to break the\r\nlance for Belgium's independence?\r\n\r\nIt would be useless at this late day to attempt to determine what\r\nwould have been the course of the great war had England stayed out of\r\nit. But this much is certain, that Belgium's loss of independence\r\nwould have lasted only until the conclusion of peace. The war would\r\nthen not have grown as now to be a world-war--to be the greatest and\r\nmost tragic catastrophe which the human race has ever suffered. No\r\nnation has ever incurred a greater, a more comprehensive\r\nresponsibility than England! And one can only regret most deeply that\r\nthese men will have to bear now and in the world to come the full and\r\noppressive burden of that responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalais or Suez?\r\n\r\nWhich Should be Germany's Objective?\r\n\r\n\r\n_By special cable to_ THE NEW YORK TIMES _from London on July 1, 1915,\r\ncame the following information:_\r\n\r\nCount von Reventlow, in last Sunday's Deutsche Tageszeitung, explains\r\nthe importance and meaning of Calais as a German objective in the west\r\nand as a key to the destruction of the British Empire. Dr. Ernst\r\nJaeckh, in an article called \"Calais or Suez,\" maintained that if an\r\nEnglish statesman had to make a choice he would undoubtedly give up\r\nCalais and cling to Suez rather than give up Suez and control Calais.\r\nReventlow maintains there is no reality about this alternative.\r\n\r\nAbout the importance of Suez, Jaeckh and Reventlow are agreed.\r\nReventlow for his part declares England's main interest in the\r\nDardanelles operations is the desire to protect Egypt and that this is\r\nthe explanation of all her efforts to range the Balkan countries\r\nagainst Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Turkey. As translated in THE\r\nTIMES he proceeds:\r\n\r\n\"These efforts are not yet at an end, and they will be continued with\r\na desperate expenditure of strength and all possible means. It was\r\nbelieved that the Russian armies and influence exercised upon the\r\nBalkan peoples would make Egypt safe. These hopes are now tottering or\r\nvanishing. All the greater must be the energy of our triple alliance\r\nin order completely to clear the way and then at the proper moment to\r\ntake it with firm determination to see the thing through. Here also we\r\nsee the correctness of our old argument, that for Germany and her\r\nallies success lies in a long war and that time works for them if they\r\nemploy the time in working. Our forces are increasing with time and,\r\nas has been said, Germany has the assured possibility of gaining time.\r\nTo strike our chief enemy at a vital point is worth the greatest\r\nefforts and sacrifice of time, quite apart from the fact that we owe\r\nit to the Turkish Empire to assist with all our strength in restoring\r\nEgypt, which was stolen by England.\"\r\n\r\nReventlow then says that a comparison of \"the Calais idea\" with Suez\r\nis as idle as the comparison of a chair with a table. He says Jaeckh\r\nis mistaken in supposing Calais does not concern more than the south\r\ncoast of England or that it merely threatens one of many ways to and\r\nfrom England. Reventlow says:\r\n\r\n\"This by no means completes the Calais idea. From a military or\r\npolitical or economic point of view one should look at the matter with\r\nthe eyes of Great Britain and define the Calais idea as a possibility\r\nfor a seafaring continental power to conduct a war against Great\r\nBritain from the continental coast channel and with all military\r\nresources while holding open communication between the Atlantic Ocean\r\nand the North Sea.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL LOUIS BOTHA\r\n\r\nThe Boer Commander Who Added German Southwest Africa to the British\r\nCrown\r\n\r\n(_Photo from Medem Photo Service._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. ANTON MEYER-GERHARD\r\n\r\nSent by Count Bernstorff to inform the Kaiser upon the state of\r\nAmerican Opinion\r\n\r\n(_Photo from American Press Association._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote on the Principle of Nationality\r\n\r\nBy John Galsworthy\r\n\r\n     This article, dealing with the consequences of the war,\r\n     originally appeared in La Revue of Paris, and is here\r\n     reproduced by permission of Mr. Galsworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these times one dread lies heavy on heart and brain--the thought\r\nthat after all the unimaginable suffering, waste, and sacrifice of\r\nthis war, nothing may come of it, no real relief, no permanent benefit\r\nto Europe, no improvement to the future of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe pronouncements of publicists--\"This must never happen again,\"\r\n\"Conditions for abiding peace must be secured,\" \"The United States of\r\nEurope must be founded,\" \"Militarism must cease\"--all such are the\r\nnatural outcome of this dread. They are proclamations admirable in\r\nsentiment and intention. But human nature being what it has been and\r\nis likely to remain, we must face the possibility that nothing will\r\ncome of the war, save the restoration of Belgium, (that, at least, is\r\ncertain;) some alterations of boundaries; a long period of economic\r\nand social trouble more bitter than before; a sweeping moral reaction\r\nafter too great effort. Cosmically regarded, this war is a debauch\r\nrather than a purge, and debauches have always to be paid for.\r\n\r\nConfronting the situation in this spirit, we shall be the more\r\nrejoiced if any of our wider hopes should by good fortune be attained.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the restoration of Belgium--for what do we continue to\r\nfight? We go on, as we began, because we all believe in our own\r\ncountries and what they stand for. And in considering how far the\r\nprinciple of nationality should be exalted, one must well remember\r\nthat it is in the main responsible for the present state of things. In\r\ntruth, the principle of nationality of itself and by itself is a quite\r\ninsufficient ideal. It is a mere glorification of self in a world full\r\nof other selves; and only of value in so far as it forms part of that\r\nlarger ideal, an--international ethic, which admits the claims and\r\nrespects the aspirations of all nations. Without that ethic little\r\nnations are (as at the present moment) the prey--and, according to the\r\nmere principle of nationality, the legitimate prey--of bigger nations.\r\nGermany absorbed Alsace-Lorraine, Schleswig, and now Belgium, by\r\nvirtue of nationalism, of an overweening belief in the perfection of\r\nits national self. Austria would subdue Serbia from much the same\r\nfeeling. France does not wish to absorb or subdue any European people\r\nof another race, because France, as ever, a little in advance of her\r\nage, is already grounded in this international ethic, of unshakable\r\nrespect for the rights of all nations which belong, roughly speaking,\r\nto the same stage of development. The same may be said of the other\r\nwestern democratic powers, Britain and America. \"To live and let\r\nlive,\" \"to dwell together in unity,\" are the guiding maxims of the\r\ninternational ethic, by virtue of which alone have the smaller\r\ncommunities of men--the Belgiums, Bohemias, Polands, Serbias,\r\nDenmarks, Switzerlands of Europe--any chance of security in the\r\nmaintenance of their national existences. In short the principle of\r\nnationality, unless it is prepared to serve this international ethic,\r\nis but a frank abettor of the devilish maxim, \"Might is right.\" All\r\nthis is truism; but truisms are often the first things we forget.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of nationality in Europe bristles with\r\ndifficulties. It cannot be solved by theory and rule of thumb. What is\r\na nation? Shall it be determined by speech, by blood, by geographical\r\nboundary, by historic tradition? The freedom and independence of a\r\ncountry can and ever should be assured when with one voice it demands\r\nthe same. It is seldom as easy as all that. Belgium, no doubt, is as\r\none man. Poland is as one man in so far as the Poles are concerned;\r\nbut what of the Austrians, Russians, Germans settled among them? What\r\nof Ireland split into two camps? What of the Germans in Bohemia, in\r\nAlsace, in Schleswig-Holstein? Compromise alone is possible in many\r\ncases, going by favor of majority. And there will always remain the\r\npoignant question of the rights and aspirations of minorities. Let us\r\nby all means clear the air by righting glaring wrongs, removing\r\npalpable anomalies, redressing obvious injustices, securing so far as\r\npossible the independent national life of homogeneous groups; but let\r\nus not, dazzled by the glamour of a word, dream that by restoring a\r\nfew landmarks, altering a few boundaries, and raising a paean to the\r\nword Nationality, we can banish all clouds from the sky of Europe, and\r\nmuzzle the ambitions of the stronger nations.\r\n\r\nIn my convinced belief the one solid hope for future peace, the one\r\npromise of security for the rights and freedom of little countries,\r\nthe one reasonable guarantee of international justice and general\r\nhumanity, lies in the gradual growth of democracy, of rule by consent\r\nof the governed. When this has spread till the civilization of the\r\nWestern world is on one plane--instead of as now on two--then and then\r\nonly we shall begin to draw the breath of assurance. Then only will\r\nthe little countries sleep quietly in their beds. It is conceivable,\r\nnay probable, that the despotic will of a perfect man could achieve\r\nmore good for his country and for the world at large in a given time\r\nthan the rule of the most enlightened democracy. It is certain that\r\nsuch men occupy the thrones of this earth but once in a blue moon.\r\n\r\nIf proof be needed that the prevalence of democracy alone can end\r\naggression among nations, secure the rights of small peoples, foster\r\njustice and humaneness in man--let the history of this last century\r\nand a half be well examined, and let the human probabilities be\r\nweighed. Which is the more likely to advocate wars of aggression?\r\nThey, who by age, position, wealth, are secure against the daily\r\npressure of life and the sacrifice that war entails, they who have\r\npassed their time out of touch with the struggle for existence, in an\r\natmosphere of dreams, ambitions, and power over other men? Or they,\r\nwho every hour are reminded how hard life is, even at its most\r\nprosperous moments, who have nothing to gain by war, and all, even\r\nlife, to lose; who by virtue of their own struggles have a deep\r\nknowledge of, a certain dumb sympathy with, the struggles of their\r\nfellow-creatures; an instinctive repugnance to making those struggles\r\nharder; who have heard little and dreamed less of those so-called\r\n\"national interests,\" that are so often mere chimeras; who love, no\r\ndoubt, in their inarticulate way the country where they were born, and\r\nthe modes of life and thought to which they are accustomed, but know\r\nof no traditional and artificial reasons why the men of other\r\ncountries should not be allowed to love their own land and modes of\r\nthought and life in equal peace and security?\r\n\r\nAssuredly, the latter of these two kinds of men are the less likely to\r\nfavor ambitious projects and aggressive wars. According as \"the\r\npeople\" have or have not the final decision in such matters, the\r\nfuture of Europe will be made of war or peace; of respect or of\r\ndisregard for the rights of little nations. It is advanced against\r\ndemocracies that the workers of a country, ignorant and provincial in\r\noutlook, have no grasp of international politics. This is true in\r\nEurope where national ambitions and dreams are still for the most part\r\nhatched and nurtured in nests perched high above the real needs and\r\nsentiments of the simple working folk who form nine-tenths of the\r\npopulation of each country. But once those nests of aggressive\r\nnationalism have fallen from their high trees, so soon as all Europe\r\nconforms to the principle of rule by consent of the governed, it will\r\nbe found--as it has been already found in France--that the general\r\nsense of the community informed by an ever-growing publicity (through\r\nmeans of communication ever speeding-up) is quite sufficient trustee\r\nof national safety; quite able, even enthusiastically able, to defend\r\nits country from attack. The problem before the world at the end of\r\nthis war is how to eliminate the virus of an aggressive nationalism\r\nthat will lead to fresh outbursts of death. It is a problem that I,\r\nfor one, frankly believe will beat the powers and goodwill of all,\r\nunless there should come a radical change of Governments in Central\r\nEurope; unless the real power in Germany and Austria-Hungary passes\r\ninto the hands of the people of those countries, as already it has\r\npassed in France and Britain. This is in my belief the only chance for\r\nthe defeat of militarism, of that raw nationalism, which, even if\r\nbeaten down at first, will ever be lying in wait, preparing secret\r\nrevenge and fresh attacks.\r\n\r\nHow this democratization of Central Europe can be brought about I\r\ncannot tell. It is far off as yet. But if this be not at last the\r\noutcome of the war, we may still talk in vain of the rights of little\r\nnations, of peace, disarmament, of chivalry, justice, and humanity. We\r\nmay whistle for a changed world.\r\n\r\nJOHN GALSWORTHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSinger of \"La Marseillaise\"\r\n\r\nBy H.T.

It is here\r\n     reproduced by Mr. Bennett's express permission.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a recent article I said that for reasons discoverable and\r\nundiscoverable the military situation had been of late considerably\r\nfalsified in the greater part of the Press. This saying (which by the\r\nway was later confirmed by the best military experts writing in the\r\nPress) aroused criticism both public and private. That it should have\r\nbeen criticised in certain organs was natural, for these organs had\r\ncertainly been colouring or manipulating their war news, including\r\ncasualties, chiefly by headlines and type, and even influencing their\r\nexpert analysis of war-news, to suit what happened to be at the moment\r\ntheir political aims.\r\n\r\nEven the invasion scare was last week revived by the \"Daily Mail\" as\r\nan aid to compulsion. The \"Daily Mail\" asserted that, whatever we\r\nmight say, invasion was possible. True. It is. Most things are. But\r\ninvasion is responsibly held to be so wildly improbable that our\r\nmilitary, as distinguished from our naval, plans are permitted\r\npractically to ignore the possibility. Compulsion or no compulsion,\r\nthose plans will be the same. They will be unaffected by any amount of\r\ninvasion-scaring, and therefore to try to foster pessimism in the\r\npublic by alarums about invasion is both silly and naughty.\r\n\r\nNewspapers quite apart, however, there has been in the country a\r\nconsiderable amount of pessimism which I have not been able to\r\nunderstand, much less sympathise with; pessimism of the kind that\r\nrefuses to envisage the future at all. It has not said: \"We shall be\r\nbeaten.\" But it has groaned and looked gloomy, and asked mute\r\nquestions with its eyes. It has resented confident faith and demanded\r\nwith sardonic superiority the reasons for such faith.\r\n\r\nOf the tribe of pessimists I count some superlative specimens among my\r\nimmediate acquaintances. The explanation of their cases is, I contend,\r\nthreefold. First, they lack faith, not merely in the Allied arms, but\r\nin anything. They have not the faculty of faith. Secondly, they\r\nunconsciously enjoy depression, and this instinct distorts all\r\nphenomena for them. Thus they exhibited no satisfaction whatever at\r\nthe capture of Przemysl full of men and munitions by the Russians,\r\nwhereas the recapture of Przemysl empty of men and munitions by the\r\nGermans filled them with delicious woe. Thirdly, they lack patience,\r\nand therefore a long-sustained effort gets on their nerves. Others I\r\ncan inoculate with my optimism, but the effect passes quickly, and\r\neach succeeding reinoculation has been less and less effective, with\r\nthe monotonous questioning, ever more sardonic in tone: \"How can you\r\nbe deluded by the official bulletins?\" or: \"What do you know about\r\nwar, to make you so cocksure?\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is that I am not deluded by the official bulletins. I don't\r\nknow how long it is since I learnt to appreciate official bulletins at\r\ntheir true value, but it is a long while ago. A full perception of\r\nthe delusiveness of official bulletins can only be obtained by reading\r\nhistories of the war. The latest I have read are those of Mr. John\r\nBuchan and Mr. Hillaire Belloc. (Mr. Buchan's is good. Mr. Belloc's is\r\nmore than good: it is--apart from a few failures in style, due either\r\nto fatigue or to the machinery of dictation--absolutely brilliant,\r\nboth militarily and politically. I am inclined to rate the last dozen\r\npages of Mr. Belloc's book as the finest piece of writing yet produced\r\nby the war.) And when one compares, in these works, the coherent,\r\nimpartial, and convincing accounts of, say, the first month of the\r\nwar, with the official bulletins of the Allies during that month, one\r\nmarvels that even officialism could go so far in evasion and\r\nduplicity, and the reputation of official bulletins is ruined for the\r\nwhole duration of the conflict. No wonder the contents of the Allied\r\nnewspapers in that period inspired the Germans with a scornful\r\nincredulity, which nothing that has since happened can shake.\r\n\r\nIt is not that official bulletins are incorrect; they are incomplete,\r\nand, therefore, misleading. The policy which frames them seems now to\r\nbe utterly established, but my motion that it is a mistaken policy\r\nremains unaltered. When the policy is pushed as far as the suppression\r\nof isolated misfortunes which flame in the headlines of the enemy\r\nPress from Cologne to Constantinople, then I begin to wonder whether I\r\nam living in three dimensions or in four.\r\n\r\nIf, then, he does not rely on the official bulletins, and he has no\r\nmilitary expertise, how is the civilian justified in being optimistic?\r\nThe reply is that the use of his common-sense may justify his\r\noptimism. The realm of common-sense being universal, even war comes\r\nwithin it. And the fact is that the major aspects of the war are no\r\nmore military than they are political, social, and psychological. Take\r\none of the most important aspects--the character of generals. It\r\ncannot be denied that after ten months, confidence in Joffre has\r\nincreased. At the beginning of the war, when the German plan was\r\nbeing exactly followed and was succeeding, when the Germans had an\r\nimmense advantage of numbers, when their reserves of men and munitions\r\nwere untouched, when everything was against us, and everything in\r\nfavour of the Germans, Joffre, aided by the British, defeated the\r\nGermans. He defeated them by superior generalship. Common-sense says\r\nthat now, when the boot is on the other leg, Joffre will assuredly\r\ndefeat the Germans--and decisively, and common-sense is quite prepared\r\nto wait until Joffre is ready. Again, take the case of the Grand Duke.\r\nThe Grand Duke has shown over and over again that he is an extremely\r\nbrilliant general of the first order. In the very worst days, when\r\neverything was against him and everything in favour of the Germans, as\r\nin the West, he held his own and he has continually produced many more\r\ncasualties in the German ranks than the Germans have produced in his\r\nranks. He still has many things against him, but it is not possible\r\nreasonably to believe that the Grand Duke will let himself in for a\r\ndisaster. That he should avoid a disaster is all that the West front\r\ndemands of him at present.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, General von Moltke, head of the German Great\r\nGeneral Staff, has been superseded. What German General has advanced\r\nin reputation? There is only one answer--von Hindenberg. Von\r\nHindenberg won the largest (not the most important) victory of the war\r\nin the Battle of Tannenberg. He won it because the ground was\r\nexceedingly difficult, and because he knew the ground far better than\r\nany other man on earth. He was entitled to very high credit. He got\r\nit. He became the idol of the German populace, and the bugbear of the\r\nAllied countries. But he has done nothing since. Soon after Tannenberg\r\nhe made a fool of himself on the Russian frontier, and showed that\r\nsuccess had got into his head. He subsequently initiated several\r\nterrific attempts, all of which were excessively costly and none of\r\nwhich was carried through. If he has not ceased to be an idol, he has\r\nat any rate ceased to be a bugbear.\r\n\r\nAs for the average intelligence of the opposing forces, it may be said\r\nthat Prussian prestige, though it dies very slowly, is dying, even in\r\nthe minds of our pessimists. Their zest for elaborate organization of\r\nplan gave the Germans an immense advantage at the start, but it is\r\nproved that, once the plan has gone wrong, they are at the best not\r\nbetter in warfare than ourselves. Their zest for discipline, and their\r\nreserves, have enabled them to stave off a catastrophe longer than\r\nperhaps any other nation could have staved it off. But time is now\r\nshowing that excessive discipline and organization produce defects\r\nwhich ultimately outweigh the qualities they spring from. The tenacity\r\nof the Germans is remarkable, but does it surpass ours? Man for man, a\r\nsoldier of the Allies is better than a soldier of the Central\r\nPowers--or ten thousand observers have been deceived. As for the\r\nintelligence of the publics upon whose moral the opposing forces\r\nultimately depend, it is undeniable that the German public is\r\nextremely hysterical, and far more gullible even than ourselves at our\r\nvery worst. The legends believed by the German public today are\r\nridiculous enough to stamp Germany for a century as an arch-simpleton\r\namong nations. Its vanity is stupendous, eclipsing all previously\r\nknown vanities. The Great General Staff must know fairly well how\r\nmatters stand, and yet not the mere ignorant public, but the King of\r\nBavaria himself, had the fatuity as late as last week to talk about\r\nthe new territory that Germany would annex as a result of the war!\r\n\r\nIn numbers we in the West had got the better of them, and were slowly\r\nincreasing our lead, before Italy, by joining us, increased the\r\nAllies' advantage at a stroke by over three-quarters of a million\r\nfully mobilised men, and much more than as many reserves.\r\n\r\nIn financial resources there is simply no comparison between the enemy\r\nand ourselves. We are right out of sight of the enemy in this\r\nfundamental affair.\r\n\r\nWe lack nothing--neither leading, nor brains, nor numbers, nor\r\nmoney--save ammunition. Does any pessimist intend to argue that we\r\nshall not get all the ammunition we need? It is inconceivable that we\r\nshould not get it. When we have got it the end can be foretold like\r\nthe answer to a mathematical problem.\r\n\r\nLastly, while the Germans have nothing to hope for in the way of\r\nfurther help, we have much to hope for. We have, for example, Rumania\r\nto hope for; and other things needless to mention. And we have in hand\r\nenterprises whose sudden development might completely change the face\r\nof the war in a few hours; but whose failure would not prejudice our\r\nmain business, because our main business is planned and nourished\r\nindependently of them. One of these enterprises is known to all men.\r\nThe other is not. The Germans have no such enterprises in hand.\r\n\r\nFor all the foregoing argument no military expertise is necessary. It\r\nlies on a plane above military expertise. It appeals to common-sense\r\nand it cannot be gainsaid. I have not yet met anybody of real\r\nauthority who has attempted to gainsay it, or who has not endorsed it.\r\nThe sole question is, not whether we shall win or lose, but when we\r\nshall win.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I strongly object to statesmen, no matter who they be,\r\ngoing about and asserting to listening multitudes that we are fighting\r\nfor our very existence as a nation. We most emphatically are not. It\r\nis just conceivable that certain unscrupulous marplots might by\r\nchicane produce such domestic discord in this country as would\r\nundermine the very basis of victory. I regard the thing as in the very\r\nhighest degree improbable, but it can be conceived. The result might\r\nbe an inconclusive peace, and another war, say, in twenty years, when\r\nwe probably _should_ be fighting for our very existence as a nation.\r\nBut we are not now, and at the worst shall not be for a long time,\r\nfighting for our very existence as a nation. Nobody believes such an\r\nassertion; pessimists themselves do not believe it. And when\r\nstatesmen give utterance to it in the hope of startling the\r\nworking-class into a desired course of conduct, they under-rate the\r\nintelligence of the working-class and the result of such oratory is\r\nfar from what they could wish.\r\n\r\nOur national existence is as safe as it has been any time this\r\ncentury; indeed, it is safer, for its chief menace has received a\r\nterrible blow, and the Prussian superstition is exploded. All that can\r\nbe urged is that we have an international job to finish; that in order\r\nto finish it properly and within a reasonable period we must work with\r\na will and in full concord; and that if we fail to do this the job\r\nwill be botched, with a risk of sinister consequences to the next\r\ngeneration. The notion that to impress the public it is necessary to\r\npile on the agony with statements that no moderately enlightened\r\nperson can credit, is a wrong notion, and, like all wrong notions, can\r\nonly do harm. The general public is all right, quite as all right as\r\nthe present Government or any other. Had it not been so we should not\r\nbe where we are today, but in a far less satisfactory position. Not\r\nGovernments, not generals, but the masses make success in these mighty\r\naltercations. Read Tolstoi's \"War and Peace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe War and Racial Progress\r\n\r\n[From the Morning Post of London, July 2, 1915]\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Leonard Darwin, in his presidential address on \"Eugenics During\r\nand After the War\" to the Eugenics Education Society at the Grafton\r\nGalleries yesterday, said that our military system seemed to be\r\ndevised with the object of insuring that all who were defective should\r\nbe exempt from risks, whilst the strong, courageous, and patriotic\r\nshould be endangered. Men with noble qualities were being destroyed,\r\nwhilst the unfit remained at home to become fathers of families, and\r\nthis must deteriorate the natural qualities of the coming generations.\r\nThe chances of stopping war were small, and we must consider how to\r\nminimize its evils. If conscription were adopted future wars would\r\nproduce less injury to the race, because the casualty lists would more\r\nnearly represent a chance selection of the population; though whether\r\na conscript army would ever fight as well as our men were doing in\r\nFrance was very doubtful. The injurious effects of the war on all\r\nuseful sections of the community should be mitigated. Military\r\ntraining was eugenic if the men were kept with the colours only for\r\nshort periods. Officers must, of course, be engaged for long periods,\r\nand amongst them the birth rate was very low. An increase of pay would\r\nbe beneficial in this respect, but only if given in the form of an\r\nadditional allowance for each living child. In the hope of increasing\r\nthe birth rate attempts were likely to be made to exalt the \"unmarried\r\nwife,\" a detestable term against which all true wives should protest.\r\nIf a change in moral standards was demanded in the hope that an\r\nincrease in the habit of forming irregular unions would result in an\r\nincrease in the population, that plea entirely failed because the\r\ndesired effect would not thus be produced. A special effort ought now\r\nto be made on eugenic as well as on other grounds to maintain the high\r\nstandards of home life which had ever existed in our race, and which\r\nhad been in large measure the basis of our social and racial progress\r\nin the past. If we did not now take some steps to insure our own\r\nracial progress being at least as rapid as that of our neighbours, and\r\nif our nation should in consequence cease in future to play a great\r\npart in the noble and eternal struggle for human advancement, then the\r\nfault would be ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English Word, Thought, and Life\r\n\r\nBy Russian Men of Letters\r\n\r\n     A group of sixty-seven Russian writers and publicists,\r\n     comprising the best men of letters of the nation, with the\r\n     exception of Vladimir Korolenko, who is at present in\r\n     France, have signed a reply to the tribute to the writers of\r\n     Russia by English men of letters, a translation of which was\r\n     printed in CURRENT HISTORY for February, 1915. The text of\r\n     the reply, given below, is taken from the Moscow daily\r\n     newspaper, Outro Rossii; its translation into English by Leo\r\n     Pasvolsky appeared in the New York Evening Post of June\r\n     20th.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have known you for a long time. We have known you since we Russians\r\ncame to a communion with Western Europe and began to draw from the\r\ngreat spiritual treasury created by our brethren of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nFrom generation to generation we have watched intently the life of\r\nEngland, and have stored away in our minds and our hearts everything\r\nbrilliant, peculiar, and individual, that has impressed itself upon\r\nthe English word, the English thought, and the English life.\r\n\r\nWe have always wondered at the breadth and the manifoldness of the\r\nEnglish soul, in whose literature one finds, side by side, Milton and\r\nSwift, Scott and Shelley, Shakespeare and Byron. We have always been\r\namazed by the incessant and constantly growing power of civic life in\r\nEngland; we have always known that the English people was the first\r\namong the peoples of the world to enter upon a struggle for civic\r\nrights, and that nowhere does the word _freedom_ ring so proud and so\r\ntriumphant as it does in England.\r\n\r\nWith wonder and veneration, have we watched the English people, that\r\ncombines the greatest idealism with the most marvellous creative\r\ngenius, that constantly transforms words into deeds, aspirations into\r\nactions, thoughts and feelings into institutions, go onward, from step\r\nto step, reaching out into the heavens, yet never relinquishing the\r\nearth, higher and higher along its triumphant road, still onward in\r\nits work of creating the life of England.\r\n\r\nKingdoms and peoples, cultures and institutions, pass away like\r\ndreams. But thoughts and words remain, whether they be of white men,\r\nor black, or yellow, whether they be of Jews or of Hellenes, whether\r\nthey be inscribed on slabs of stone, or on boards of clay, or on\r\nstrips of papyrus. Words and thoughts live to the present day; they\r\nstill move us and uplift us, even though we have already forgotten the\r\nnames of those who spoke them. And we know that only the winged words\r\nlive on, the words that are intelligible to the whole of mankind, that\r\nappeal to the whole of humanity, to the common human mind, the common\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nWe know the vast power of the English word. We know what a marvellous\r\ncontribution the English writers have made to the life not of England\r\nalone, but to that of the whole world, the whole humanity. It is with\r\na feeling of long-standing affection and veneration that we turn to\r\nthe ancient book, called \"England,\" whose pages never grow yellow,\r\nwhose letters are never effaced, whose thoughts never become dim,\r\nwhose new chapters bear witness to the fact that the book is still\r\nbeing written, that new pages are still being added, and that these\r\nnew pages are permeated with that same bright and powerful spirit of\r\nhumanity that illumines and enlivens the pages of the past.\r\n\r\nWe feel proud because you have recognized the great individual worth\r\nof the Russian literature, and we are moved by your ardent expressions\r\nof sympathy and friendship. You scarcely know what Lord Byron was to\r\nus at the dawn of our literature, how our greatest poets, Poushkin and\r\nLermontov, were swayed by him. You scarcely know to what an extent the\r\nShakespearean Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark, has become a part of our\r\nliterature, how near to us is Hamlet's tragedy.\r\n\r\nWe, too, pronounce the names of Copperfield and Snodgrass with a\r\nlittle difficulty, but the name of Dickens is as familiar to us and as\r\nnear to our hearts as the names of some of our own writers.\r\n\r\nWe trust, and we even permit ourselves to hope, that our friendship\r\nwill not end on the fields of battle, but that our mutual\r\nunderstanding will continue to grow, as it lives on together with\r\nthose sincere and heartfelt words, with which you have addressed us.\r\nWe trust that it will be transformed into a spiritual unity between\r\nus, a unity based on the universal achievements of the spirit of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nWe trust even further. We trust that evil will finally become\r\nextinguished in the hearts of men, that mutual ill-feeling will be\r\nbitter and poignant no longer, and that, when ears of corn will be\r\nagain fluttering upon the fields, mutilated by trenches and ramparts,\r\nand drenched in human blood, when wild flowers will begin to grow over\r\nthe countless unknown graves, time will come, when the nations that\r\nare separated by such a tremendous gulf today, will come together\r\nagain upon the one great road of humanity and will turn back once more\r\nto the great, universal words, that are common to all men.\r\n\r\nWe trust, and we hope.\r\n\r\nGreetings to you.\r\n\r\n(Signed)\r\n\r\nL.

It is of no use to rush it in a motor; you might as well hop\r\nover by aeroplane. In order to savor the experience to the full, you\r\nmust take staff and scrip, like the Ritter Tannhaeuser, and go the\r\npilgrim's way. It is a joy even to pass from the guttural and\r\nexplosive place names of Teutonia to the liquid music of the southern\r\nvocables--from Brieg to Domo d'Ossola, from Goeschenen to Bellinzona,\r\nfrom St. Moritz to Chiavenna, from Botzen and Brixen to Ala and\r\nVerona. It is a still greater joy to exchange the harsh, staring\r\ncolors of the north for the soft luminosity of the south, as you\r\nzigzag down from the bare snows to the pines, from the pines to the\r\nchestnuts, from the chestnuts to the trellised vineyards. And just\r\nabout where the vineyards begin, you come upon two wayside posts, one\r\nof them inscribed \"Schweiz\" or \"Oesterreich,\" the other bearing the\r\nmagic word \"Italia.\" If your heart does not leap at the sight of it\r\nyou may as well about-turn and get you home again; for you have no\r\nsense of history, no love of art, no hunger for divine, inexhaustible\r\nbeauty. For all these things are implicit in the one word, \"Italy.\"\r\n\r\nAlas! the charm of this excursion has from of old made irresistible\r\nappeal to the northern barbarian. That has been Italy's historic\r\nmisfortune. For certain centuries, under the dominance of Rome, she\r\nkept the Goths and Huns and Vandals aloof by what is called in India a\r\n\"forward policy\"--by throwing the outworks of civilization far beyond\r\nthe Alpine barrier. But Rome fell to decay, and, wave upon wave, the\r\nbarbarian--generally the Teuton, under one alias or another--surged\r\nover her glorious highlands, her bounteous lowlands, and her marvelous\r\ncities. It is barely half a century since the hated Tedeschi were\r\nexpelled from the greater part of their Cisalpine possessions; and\r\nnow, in the fullness of time, Italy has resolved to redeem the last of\r\nher ravished provinces and to make her boundaries practically\r\nconterminous with Italian speech and race.\r\n\r\nThe political and military aspects of the situation have been fully\r\ndealt with elsewhere; but a lifelong lover of Italy may perhaps be\r\npermitted to state his personal view of her action. While the\r\nnegotiations lasted, her position was scarcely a dignified one. It\r\nseemed that she was willing, not, indeed, to sell her birthright for a\r\nmess of pottage, but to buy her birthright at the cost of complicity\r\nin monstrous crime. Neither Italy nor Europe would have profited in\r\nthe long run by the substitution of \"Belgia Irredenta\" for \"Italia\r\nIrredenta.\" But now that she has repudiated the sops offered to her\r\nhonor and conscience, her position is clear and fine. She has rejected\r\nlarger concessions, probably, than any great power has ever before\r\nbeen prepared to make without stroke of sword; and she has thrown in\r\nher lot with the Allies in no time-serving spirit, but at a point when\r\ntheir fortunes were by no means at their highest. This is a gesture\r\nentirely worthy of a great and high-spirited people.\r\n\r\nIt is true that she had no guarantee for the promised concessions\r\nexcept the \"Teutonica fides,\" which has become a byword and a\r\nreproach. But I am much mistaken if that was the sole or main motive\r\nthat determined her resort to arms. She took a larger view. She felt\r\nthat even if Germany, by miracle, kept her faith, the world, after a\r\nGerman victory, would be no place for free men to live in. She was not\r\nmoved by the care for a few square miles of territory, more or less,\r\nbut by a strong sense of democratic solidarity and of human dignity.\r\nAfter the events of the past ten months, she felt that, to a\r\nself-respecting man or nation, German hate was infinitely preferable\r\nto German love. It was, in fact, a patent of nobility.\r\n\r\nAnd now that Italy is ranked with us against the powers of evil, it\r\nbecomes more than ever our duty to strain every nerve for their\r\ndefeat. We are now taking our share in the guardianship of the world's\r\ngreat treasure house of historic memories and of the creations of\r\ngenius. We have become, as it were, co-trustees of an incomparable,\r\nirreplaceable heritage of beauty. Italy has been the scene of many and\r\nterrible wars; but since she emerged from the Dark Ages I do not know\r\nthat war has greatly damaged the glory of her cities. She has not, of\r\nrecent centuries, had to mourn a Louvain or a Rheims. But if the\r\nTeuton, in his present temper, should gain any considerable footing\r\nwithin her bounds, the Dark Ages would be upon her once more. What\r\neffort can be too great to avert such a calamity!\r\n\r\nI am not by way of being versed in the secrets of Courts; but I recall\r\ntoday, with encouragement, a conversation I had some years ago with an\r\nex-Ambassador to Italy (not a British Ambassador) who had been on\r\nintimate terms with the King, and spoke with enthusiasm of his\r\nMajesty's character. He told me of his bravery, his devotion to duty,\r\nhis simple manners, his high intelligence. One little anecdote I may\r\nrepeat without indiscretion. A Minister of Education said to my friend\r\nthat when he had an interview with the King he felt like a schoolboy\r\nbringing up to an exacting though kindly master a half-prepared\r\nlesson; and when this was repeated to his Majesty, he smiled and said:\r\n\"Ministers come and go, but I, you see, am always here.\" He merited\r\nfar better than his grandfather (said my informant) the title of \"il\r\nRe Galantuomo.\" Under such a Chief of State Italy may, with high hope\r\nand courage, set about her task of tearing away her unredeemed fringes\r\nfrom that patchwork of tyrannies known as the Austrian Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWho Died Content!\r\n\r\n[From the Westminster Gazette]\r\n\r\n     Rex and Wilfred Winslow were the first men who died on the\r\n     field of German South West Africa.

It is not true that our troops brutally destroyed Louvain. It is\r\nnot true that we make war in contempt of the rights of mankind. Our\r\nsoldiers commit neither undisciplined nor cruel acts...._\"\r\n\r\n_MANIFESTO OF THE GERMAN INTELLECTUALS._\r\n\r\n\"_If the savants make science what it is, science does not make the\r\ncharacter of the savants what it is._\"\r\n\r\n_EDMOND PERRIER._\r\n\r\n\"_... Scientific barbarism_.\"\r\n\r\n_EMILE BOUTROUX._\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIf we were able--at this hour, when, through the act of the Teutonic\r\nEmpire, the world may witness unnamable deeds--if we were able to cite\r\nthe most odious of them, we should say that, after the massacre of\r\ninnocent people and all the assaults on the rights of mankind\r\ncommitted by the German armies, the worst has seemed to us the\r\nshameless manner in which the superior intellects beyond the Rhine\r\nhave dared to cover up these crimes. It is not that we ever believed\r\nthat from any corner of Germany there could come to us an appearance\r\nof fellow-feeling, in these circumstances wherein no one has any other\r\nright than that of giving himself body and soul to his native land. We\r\nknow that, before speaking for the universe, men threatened by the\r\nenemy should be faithful to their flag, in the face of everything and\r\nagainst everything--and with resolution. At no hour, therefore, have\r\nwe thought that German savants and artists could raise their voice to\r\nrepudiate their armies, when the latter were going to war with the\r\nobject of further extending their empire. But, at least, they should\r\nkeep silence, and before the horror of crimes to be judged especially\r\nby the tribunal of the elite they should not have shown their\r\nmiserable enthusiasm. \"You see,\" as a clear-sighted Dutch professor[5]\r\nhas well written on this point, \"if these intellectuals were not\r\nblinded they would rather have asked themselves if, in this war that\r\nstains Europe with blood, the Prussian military authorities were not\r\nlosing for centuries the reputation of the great name of Germany.\" And\r\nsuppose it were even a small matter if they had lost only the great\r\nname of Germany, that the epoch of Goethe, Kant, and Beethoven had\r\ncovered with glory. But with it they have vilified as well the noble\r\nrole of the philosopher, of the historian, of the savant, and of the\r\nartist. In truth they have betrayed their own gods, and the\r\nprofessions to which they belong can no longer be honored by them--so\r\nfar as the question of conscience goes, at least. And as for the\r\nsacred thing called civilization, which is above our interests and our\r\nvanities of an hour, they may have served it usefully by their\r\npersonal work in the past, but they were unequal to the task of\r\nremaining its protectors when their mere silence would perhaps have\r\nhelped to save it.[6] They have thus shown that, with their more or\r\nless sparkling black eagles and under the bedizenment of their Court\r\ncostumes, they are for the most part narrow fanatics or paid scribes\r\nwhose pen is only a tool in the hands of their master of a day. It is\r\nnot even sure whether through their cult of this \"militarism,\" to\r\nwhich they have given the most shameful blind-signature, they have not\r\nhopelessly condemned it, by testifying that under the rule of the\r\nGerman sabre human thought has no other course than to humiliate\r\nitself!... But on the score of what they are worth in professional\r\nmorality and courage, agreement is certain today, everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Professor Dake.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: On the score of certain names important in Germany--names\r\nnot found under the manifesto of the Intellectuals--a question arises:\r\nWere they not solicited as well to cover up these crimes, or did they\r\nrefuse? If the question were one of a simple memorial, carrying with\r\nit no abdication of conscience, this point would be without\r\nimportance, for it would simply mean that a list, however long, could\r\nnot bring together all the men of renown of a country, and omissions\r\nwould often have to be laid to chance. But here a venomous manifesto\r\nwas to be signed, made up of violent lies and of arbitrary theories;\r\nand with this in mind one may see a meaning in certain abstentions.\r\nWithout any possible doubt they are the act of courageous men, who,\r\nfeeling deeply where the truth is, will not ally themselves against\r\nit; and by their resistance they do it honor.]\r\n\r\nTheir great affair--and that of every thinking German--is to object,\r\nwhen spoken to of their crimes, either that they were born of\r\nnecessity or that they did not take place. As against these\r\nallegations, unsupported by any proof, the most formal denials have\r\nofficially been given. But to the latter we shall now add the true\r\ndescription of the facts. And we think that, in spite of the power and\r\nthe dogmatic authority of its elite, the activity of its emissaries in\r\nall parts of the world, and, finally, all its vast apparatus of\r\nconquest--military and civil--Germany cannot long make its stand\r\nagainst the humble little truth, which advances, noiselessly but also\r\nfearlessly, with the tenacious light in its hand that it received from\r\nReality--from unquenchable and ardent Reality.\r\n\r\nWe come to you armed with the facts. It is only these unanswerable\r\nwitnesses that we have wished to oppose to the gratuitous affirmations\r\nof our colleagues beyond the Rhine. We might have taken you into the\r\nmazes of twenty frightful dramas, for _at every place where the German\r\ntroops have advanced they have trodden under foot the rights of\r\nmankind and counted as nothing the civilization and the patrimony of\r\nnations_. We have thought it wiser to limit ourselves to the relation\r\nof certain events bearing the seal of certainty.\r\n\r\nNot all the cities which may have suffered have as yet opened their\r\ngates to our brothers. Not being able to collect authentic testimony\r\nthere we prefer, then, not to speak of them--for the moment. But in\r\nall those evacuated by the enemy, commissions[7] have hurried to\r\nascertain the losses on the spot. It is from these legal examinations\r\nthat we have written this report, which, in impartial fashion, makes\r\nyou the judges.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Throughout this work we shall often have recourse to the\r\nreports of these commissions. At the end of the present volume will be\r\nfound certain of these documents, unpublished till now.]\r\n\r\nUnhappy cities have been tortured in body and soul, that is to say, in\r\ntheir population and in the works built by their hands, the immortal\r\nrelics of the dead. Of the miseries the people have suffered it is not\r\npermitted us to speak. But as to those noble houses built with art\r\nwhich have been destroyed, as to those constructions erected by our\r\nancestors for the edification of men of all classes, of all times, and\r\nall countries, which are today but ruins; as to those masterpieces in\r\nwhich all the elegant poetry of our race was realized and that\r\nbelonged to the civilized world, of which they were a glory and an\r\nornament, and which subsist as nothing but a mournful heap of\r\ndebris--of these we are not bound to keep silent. But not one\r\nexaggerated word shall be uttered by us. The account we shall give is\r\nestablished by high testimony and by irrefutable documents.\r\n\r\nBut let us cease all this preparation and come to the events of\r\nRheims.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Page 59 of the book.)\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\nNo. 1.\r\n\r\nAT RHEIMS.\r\n\r\n_M. Henry Jadart, Librarian of the City of Rheims and Curator of the\r\nMuseum of that city, was present at the bombardments of the 4th and\r\nthe 19th of September. He was well placed to enlighten us on the\r\ndestruction accomplished at the time._\r\n\r\n_He was kind enough to send us the communication which we publish\r\nbelow. From the testimony of M. Jadart, it will appear how many\r\nmonumental constructions at Rheims were mutilated or destroyed, and\r\nhow these attest, not less than the ruins of the cathedral, the\r\nvandalism of the German armies:_\r\n\r\nFriday, Sept. 4.--The bombardment, which took place suddenly from\r\nhalf-past 9 till quarter-past 10 in the morning, caused some accidents\r\nto the cathedral, more or less notable from the point of view of art,\r\n(some stained glass more or less ancient, some slight scratches to the\r\nstatues;) at the Church of Saint-Remi (ancient stained glass, tapestry\r\nof the sixteenth century, pictures of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, altar screen, statues, south portal, and vault of transept)\r\nand at the Museum of Fine Arts, Rue Chanzy, 8, (salle Henry Vasnier\r\nbroken in by a shell, about twenty modern pictures damaged.) Besides,\r\namong the houses struck, the Gothic house, 57 Rue de Vesle, suffered\r\nmutilation in the sculpture of a fireplace--it was entirely demolished\r\nby the bombardment and fire of Sept. 19.\r\n\r\nSaturday, Sept. 19.--This was the day of the great destruction by the\r\nbombs and the fires caused in the cathedral, the ancient residence of\r\nthe Archbishop, in the houses of the Place Royale, and the Ceres\r\nquarter. On the afternoon of this day and during the night from\r\nSaturday to Sunday, flames consumed the most precious collections of\r\nthe city, at the Archbishop's palace and in private houses, an\r\ninventory of which it will never be possible to prepare.\r\n\r\nThe top of the cathedral burned after the scaffolding of the northern\r\ntower of the great portal had taken fire, toward 3 o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. The statues and sculptures of this side of the same portal\r\nwere licked by the flames and scorched through and through. The eight\r\nbells in this tower also were caught by the flames, and the whole\r\nthing fell down near the cross aisle of the transept. The spire of the\r\nBelfry of the Angel, at the apse, fell, and with it disappeared the\r\nleaden heads which decorated its base. In the interior the sculptures\r\nand the walls of the edifice were damaged by fire in the straw which\r\nhad been strewn about for the German wounded; the great eighteenth\r\ncentury tympanums of the lateral doors, west side, were damaged\r\nlikewise. The thirteenth century stained glass suffered shocks from\r\nthe air and were perforated, in the rose windows as also in the high\r\nwindows of the nave. The pictures in the transept were spared, but the\r\nchoir stalls (eighteenth century work) were consumed--at the left on\r\nentering.\r\n\r\nOf the adjacent palace all the buildings were attacked by the flames\r\nand are now nothing but ruined walls, save the chapel of the\r\nthirteenth century, of which the main part subsists intact, and the\r\nlower hall of the King's Lodge, under the Hall of Anointment, (of the\r\nend of the fifteenth century.) The anointment rooms on the ground\r\nfloor, reconstructed in the seventeenth century, contained a great\r\nnumber of historical portraits and furniture of various periods, which\r\nwere all a prey to the flames. It was the same in the apartments of\r\nthe Archbishops, which also contained numerous pictures and different\r\nviews of the city, transported from the Hotel de Ville and intended\r\nfor the formation of a historical museum of Rheims. Precious\r\nfurniture, bronzes of great value--like the foot of the candelabra of\r\nSaint Remi and the candelabra of the Abbaye d'Igny--were also in these\r\napartments, of which nothing is left but the walls. The archaeological\r\ncollections of the city were consumed in the upper apartments, as also\r\na whole museum, organized and classified to represent the ethnography\r\nof la Champagne by a thousand objects tracing back the ancient\r\nindustries, the trades, the arts, and usages of this province.\r\nFinally, the rich library founded by Cardinal Gousset, offering superb\r\neditions and assembled in a vast paneled hall, was totally burned up\r\nin the modern building constructed for it at the expense of the State.\r\n\r\nAfter the disasters to the arts at the cathedral and the palace, we\r\nmust note also the mansions and private houses, remarkable through\r\ntheir architecture and their decoration, that were demolished, burned,\r\nand annihilated. No. 1 Rue du Marc, Renaissance mansion--damage to the\r\nsculptured ceiling and the sculptures of the court. Two pavilions of\r\nthe Place Royale, creations of the eighteenth century, are now only\r\ncalcined walls. The same fate overtook the Gothic house, 57 Rue de\r\nVesle, (of which mention was made above;) the house, 40 Rue de\r\nl'Universite, built in the eighteenth century; the house next to the\r\nEcu de Rheims, of the same period; the mansion at 12 Rue la Grue,\r\nwhich was decorated with carved lintels and forged iron banisters; the\r\nmansion at 19 Rue Eugene-Destenque, in the style of the Henri IV.\r\nperiod, having a great stone fireplace and decorative paintings in one\r\ngallery. Finally, in the Rue des Trois-Raisinets, the remains of the\r\nmonastery of the Franciscans, with a cloister, and the framework of a\r\ngranary of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThese notes are really only observations to be completed later with\r\nthe aid of descriptions of ancient date, but they offer sure\r\ninformation of the lamentable losses suffered by our unfortunate city\r\nduring the first month of its bombardment.\r\n\r\nParis, Jan. 20, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 2.\r\n\r\nTHE FIXED IDEA.\r\n\r\n_From M. Auguste Dorchain we receive this striking observation:_\r\n\r\nThe idea of destroying the cathedral haunted them for a hundred years,\r\nat least. Three dates, three texts, three proofs:\r\n\r\nApril, 1814, Jean-Joseph Goerres, an illustrious professor, the pious\r\nauthor of a \"Christian Mysticism,\" in four volumes, wrote, in the\r\nRheinische Merkur:\r\n\r\n\"Reduce to ashes that basilica of Rheims where Klodovig was anointed,\r\nwhere that Empire of the Franks was born--the false brothers of the\r\nnoble Teutons; burn that cathedral!...\"\r\n\r\nSept. 5, 1914, we read in the Berliner Blatt:\r\n\r\n\"The western group of our armies in France has already passed the\r\nsecond line of defensive forts, except Rheims, whose royal splendor,\r\nwhich dates back to the time of the white lilies, will not fail to\r\ncrumble to dust, soon, under the fire of our mortars.\"\r\n\r\nJan. 1, 1915. In the artistic and literary supplement of the Berlin\r\nLokal-Anzeiger M. Rudolf Herzog sings an ode \"in honor of the\r\ndestruction of the Cathedral of Rheims\":\r\n\r\n\"The bells sound no more in the cathedral with two towers. Finished is\r\nthe benediction!... With lead, O Rheims, we have shut your house of\r\nidolatry!\"\r\n\r\nA lyric cry of the heart, when the national wish, a century old, is at\r\nlast accomplished.\r\n\r\nNo comment on these three texts--it suffices to bring them together.\r\n\r\nAUGUSTE DORCHAIN.\r\n\r\nFeb. 20, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 4.\r\n\r\nLETTER OF M. L'ABBE DOURLENT.\r\n\r\n_M. l'Abbe Dourlent, Curate Archpresbyter of the Cathedral of Senlis,\r\nwas one of the principal witnesses of the drama. So he has had to\r\nspeak of it several times. But up to now we had no written deposition\r\nfrom him over his signature. Here is the document which comes from\r\nthis priest. It attests his courage and sincerity at the same time._\r\n\r\nDiocese of Beauvais, Archpresbytery and Parish of Senlis, (Oise.)\r\n\r\nSENLIS, Jan. 8, 1915.\r\n\r\nMonsieur: You do me the honor to ask for my testimony as to the\r\nactions of the enemy at Senlis at the time of the occupation, on the\r\n2d of September.\r\n\r\nI beg to send you my attestation, and express my confusion and regret\r\nat not having been able to do so sooner.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of September an engagement took place between the French and\r\nGerman troops on the plain of Senlis from 10 o'clock till about\r\nhalf-past 2, and it was ended by the bombardment of our beautiful\r\ncathedral and a part of the city. The enemy entered the city about\r\nhalf-past 3 and were received at the end of the Faubourg St. Martin by\r\na fusillade directed against them by delayed soldiers and a company\r\narmed with machine guns, charged with arresting the pursuit of the\r\nFrench Army, which was bending back toward Paris.\r\n\r\nImmediately the superior officer, who was conversing with M. Odent,\r\nthe Mayor of Senlis, accused the civilians of having fired on the\r\nGerman Army, and rendered him responsible for it. Then began the\r\nburning of the whole Rue de la Republique. This untruth was\r\nimmediately spread about, and two hours after the affray a General\r\nsaid at Villers-Saint-Frambourg what another General said next morning\r\nat Nanteuil-le-Haudouin: That Senlis was burned because the civilians\r\nhad fired on the German Army. The thirty-seven hostages brought to\r\nChamant heard the same statement.\r\n\r\nTo this testimony I will add my own, which will only confirm what is\r\nsaid above: As soon as the enemy arrived soldiers of the cyclist corps\r\nobliged me to conduct them to the top of the belfry of our cathedral,\r\nfrom which they pretended that they had been shot at. Their inspection\r\nrevealed nothing of what they thought to find, for I alone had the key\r\nand I had confided it to no one. Some moments later I was consigned to\r\nthe Hotel du Grand-Cerf as a hostage. The German General Staff had\r\ngone to Chamant. Some hours later I accosted a superior officer and\r\nasked him what I should do, seeing no one of whom I could inquire the\r\nreason for my arrest. \"Remain here, where you will at least be in\r\nsafety. Poor curate! Poor Senlis! But, then, why did you receive us as\r\nyou did? The civilians shot at us, and we were fired at from the tower\r\nof your church. So Senlis is condemned. You see that street in flames?\r\n(and, in fact, the Rue de la Republique was burning everywhere, 114\r\nhouses in ruins) well, this night the city itself will be entirely\r\nburned down. We have the order to make of Senlis a French Louvain. At\r\nLouvain the Belgians shot at us from their houses, from their\r\nbelfries--Louvain no longer exists. Tomorrow it will be the same with\r\nyour place. We admit fighting among soldiers, that is war; but we are\r\npitiless with civilians. Paris and the whole of France need a terrible\r\nexample which shall remind them that warfare by civilians is a crime\r\nthat cannot be too severely punished.\"\r\n\r\nMy energetic protest against the accusation concerning the cathedral\r\nand my other doubts formulated against the intervention of civilians\r\n(I did not know what was the nature of the engagement in the Faubourg)\r\nseemed to interest the officer, who promised to make a report to the\r\nGeneral and to plead our cause. Thanks to God, the sentence was\r\nrepealed; our poor Mayor and ten hostages were shot, but the city was\r\nspared.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts, which I thought might be of interest in your\r\nresearches. I am at your orders to complete them if you need more.\r\n\r\nI beg you, Sir, to accept the expression of my most respectful\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\n(Signed.) DOURLENT.\r\nCurate Archpresbyter of Senlis.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 5.\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY OF LOUVAIN.\r\n\r\n_To close the series of depositions collected by us, here is that of\r\nM. Paul Delannoy, Librarian of the University of Louvain. The few\r\nlines he was kind enough to address to us will suffice to show the\r\nextent of the treasure formerly at Louvain and also of the disaster\r\naccomplished, which seems irreparable:_\r\n\r\nThe library of the University of Louvain possessed 500 manuscripts,\r\nabout 800 incunabulae, and 250,000 to 300,000 volumes. One noted\r\nespecially the original of the bull of foundation of the university in\r\n1425, an example on vellum of the famous work of Andre Vesale, De\r\nHumani Corporis Fabrica, an example given to the university by Charles\r\nV., a precious manuscript by Thomas a Kempis. The bibliographical\r\ncuriosities were numerous; the collection of old Flemish bindings of\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries contained some curious\r\nspecimens. The souvenirs of the ancient university, seals, diplomas,\r\nmedals, &c., were preciously guarded in cases. The old printed matters\r\nof the sixteenth century formed an extremely rare treasury; all the\r\npieces, pamphlets, and placards on the reform of the Low Countries\r\nwere kept together in a \"varia\" volume, thus constituting a unique\r\nensemble. It was the same with a host of pieces relating to Jansenism.\r\n\r\nThe great halls of the books, with artistic woodwork, were jewels of\r\neighteenth century architecture; the Salle des Pas-Perdus of the\r\nHalles Universitaires, with its vaults and capitals, has been\r\nreproduced in manuals of art and archaeology.\r\n\r\nThe reading room of the library contained a whole gallery of portraits\r\nof professors of the ancient university; this museum was a very\r\nprecious source for the literary history of the Low Countries.\r\n\r\nPAUL DELANNOY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 6.\r\n\r\nTHE TESTIMONY OF M. PIERRE LOTI.\r\n\r\n_Finally, covering these various testimonies, and deriving from his\r\nillustrious signature a character of high distinction, here is what M.\r\nPierre Loti writes us:_\r\n\r\nMore or less, everywhere in the north and east of our dear France, I\r\nhave seen with my eyes the German abominations, in which, without this\r\nexperience, I could not have believed.\r\n\r\nIn indignation and horror I associate myself with the protestations\r\nabove, as well as with all those, not yet formulated, which will come\r\nout later on and which will always be below the monstrous reality.\r\n\r\nPIERRE LOTI.\r\n\r\n_So we may say that the present memorial, tempered many a time, is\r\nless an excessive than a perfectly moderate picture._\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II.\r\n\r\nNo. 1.\r\n\r\nNOTRE DAME DE PARIS.\r\n\r\n_It will be remembered that on the 11th of October a Taube, having\r\nmanaged to penetrate the zone of Paris, flew over the city, hovered\r\njust above Notre Dame, and dropped several bombs on the cathedral.\r\nNote that this was on Sunday and that at the hour when this Taube\r\naccomplished its disastrous mission there was in Notre Dame a very\r\ngreat crowd of worshippers. None of them was hurt, but the distinction\r\nwas undeniably that of killing unarmed people and mutilating a marvel\r\nof French art._\r\n\r\n_Let us now read the first report, signed by M. Harancourt, who was\r\nable to proceed to interesting discoveries on the very day of the\r\nattempt:_\r\n\r\nMusee des Thermes et de l'Hotel de Cluny.\r\nSunday, Oct. 11, 1914.\r\n\r\nTo the Under Secretary of State for the Fine Arts, Service of Historic\r\nMonuments.\r\n\r\nAs I reside in the arrondissement of Notre Dame, I got to the\r\ncathedral some moments after the explosion of the bombs. In the\r\ncompany of a Commissary of Police, of an architect of the city, of a\r\nCanon, and of two Sergeants of the Fire Department, I examined the\r\ndamage caused in order to be able to advise the Service of Historical\r\nMonuments immediately if the case should be urgent.\r\n\r\nThe bomb exploded on the west slope of the roof of the north transept,\r\na little above the gutter, near the clock. After having pierced the\r\nlead covering it seems to have exploded only after having struck the\r\ntransverse beam, whose end is splintered. The explosion, having thus\r\ntaken place under the covering, pushed the edges of the tear outward,\r\nmaking a hole in this covering through which a young person could\r\npass; six small beams were split round about. The bomb was loaded like\r\nshrapnel, apparently with leaden bullets of different calibres, for\r\nthe roof is riddled with circular holes to a distance of twenty meters\r\nfrom there. The holes are of various diameters, but none of the\r\nbullets could be found. The nearest turret was damaged--several\r\nornaments were broken from it--the modern clockstand that incases the\r\nbig clock was riddled by pieces of shell. The bomb thrown at the apse\r\nand which fell in the garden was not this time a shrapnel bomb, but an\r\nincendiary bomb, which only threw out a sheet of flame. The third\r\nhaving fallen into the Seine, toward the south side of the porch, it\r\nis difficult to say whether it was a shrapnel bomb or an incendiary.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the damage from the artistic point of view is almost nil;\r\nit simply calls for some work by carpenters and roofers.\r\n\r\nBut the intention to harm the building is evident, and I have thought\r\nthat perhaps it would be well to take certain precautions to protect,\r\nif possible, the fine fourteenth century statue of the Virgin that\r\nstands near the pillar, and that it is not impossible perhaps to\r\ntransfer it to a safer place.\r\n\r\nE. HARANCOURT,\r\nMember of the Commission on Historical Monuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A report from M. Paul Boeswillwald, Inspector General of Historical\r\nMonuments, confirms the first statements:_\r\n\r\nHistorical Monuments, Cathedral of Paris.\r\n\r\nPARIS, Oct. 12, 1914.\r\n\r\nThe Inspector General of Historical Monuments to the Under Secretary\r\nof State for the Fine Arts.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to report that I went this morning to Notre Dame to\r\nexamine the damage caused by the bomb thrown yesterday afternoon on to\r\nthe cathedral by a German aviator. The bomb struck the lower part of\r\nthe west slope of the top of the north transept, tearing the lead,\r\nbreaking a piece of the wooden frame, and smashing by its explosion\r\nthe crown of the pinnacle which cuts the balustrade at the right of\r\nthe flying buttress intermediary in the sexpartite vault of the\r\ntransept. Other effects of the explosion were the striking of some\r\nstones and the leads of the dormer window which carries the frame of a\r\nclock, as also some small windows. The fragments of the pinnacle fell\r\non the roof of the lower slope, where they made a deep imprint on the\r\nlead cover without breaking it through.\r\n\r\nThe projectile was not an incendiary bomb, since the wood splintered\r\nby it bears no trace of fire.\r\n\r\nTo resume, the damage is, fortunately, quite unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe order has been given to set aside all the fragments of stone\r\nbelonging to the decoration of the pinnacle, remains of crockets,\r\nornaments, &c.\r\n\r\n(Signed) PAUL BOESWILLWALD.\r\n\r\n_With all the friends of civilization and of art, we think that the\r\nquestion of the slightness of the damage caused by this Taube is not\r\nto be considered at all. But the fact of this Taube having\r\naccomplished such a raid with the sole design of bombarding a\r\ncathedral in a peaceful city, 100 kilometres off from the military\r\noperations--is it not the most patent and evident demonstration of the\r\nkind of Neronian dilettantism which, along with calculation, inspires\r\nthe crimes of the barbarians?_\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III.\r\n\r\nNo. 1.\r\n\r\nWHAT OUR PROVINCIAL CITIES ARE.\r\n\r\n_Here is a page published by Anatole France apropos of the bombardment\r\nof Soissons:_\r\n\r\nI had just read in a newspaper that the Germans, who have been\r\nbombarding Soissons these four months, have dropped eighty shells on\r\nthe cathedral. A moment later chance brought before me a book of M.\r\nAndre Hallays, where I find these lines, which I take pleasure in\r\ntranscribing:\r\n\r\n\"Soissons is a white city, peaceful and smiling, that raises its tower\r\nand pointed spires at the edge of a lazy river, at the centre of a\r\ncircle of green hills. The city and the landscape make one think of\r\nthe little pictures that the illuminators of our old manuscripts\r\nlovingly painted.... Precious monuments show the whole history of the\r\nFrench Monarchy, from the Merovingian crypts of the Abbaye de\r\nSaint-Medard to the fine mansion erected on the eve of the Revolution\r\nfor the Governors of the province. Amid narrow streets and little\r\ngardens a magnificent cathedral extends the two arms of its great\r\ntransept; at the north is a straight wall, and an immense\r\nstained-glass window; at the south, that marvelous apse where the\r\nogive and the full centre combine in so delicate a fashion.\" (\"Around\r\nParis,\" Page 207.)\r\n\r\nThat charming page from a writer who dearly loves the cities and\r\nmonuments of France brought tears to my eyes. It charmed my sadness. I\r\nwant to thank my colleague for it publicly.\r\n\r\nThe brutal and stupid destruction of monuments consecrated by art and\r\nthe years is a crime that war does not excuse. May it be an eternal\r\nopprobrium for the Germans!\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 2.\r\n\r\nMARTYRDOM THAT ENNOBLES.\r\n\r\n_To illustrate this memorial, which is first addressed to the Friends\r\nof the Beautiful, and whose object is to touch the heart, we give a\r\nsonnet of M. Edmond Rostand. It is entitled, \"The Cathedral,\" and will\r\nshow that pride may be taken by the victim of violence, and that a\r\ncrime against the beautiful diminishes only the brute who commits it:_\r\n\r\nNought have they done but render it more immortal! The work does not\r\nperish that a scoundrel has struck. Ask Phidias, then, or ask of Rodin\r\nif before bits of his work men no longer say, \"It is his!\" The\r\nfortress dies when once dismantled, but the temple shattered lives but\r\nthe more nobly; and our eyes, of a sudden, remember the roof with\r\ndisdain and prefer to see the sky in the lace work of the stone. Let\r\nus give thanks, since till now we lacked what the Greeks possess on\r\nthe hill of gold--the symbol of beauty consecrated by insult! Let us\r\ngive thanks to the layers of the stupid cannon, since from their\r\nGerman skill there results for them--shame; for us--a Parthenon!\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 3.\r\n\r\nA SOLEMN PROTEST.\r\n\r\n_We mean the one issued on the 29th of October by the Academie\r\nFrancaise at one of its sessions, meeting under the Presidency of M.\r\nMarcel Prevost, M. Etienne Lamy being Perpetual Secretary. The\r\nPresident of the Republic, M. Raymond Poincare, made it a point to be\r\npresent at this session, and here is the document that, after long\r\ndeliberation, was approved by the unanimous vote of the members\r\npresent:_\r\n\r\nThe Academie Francaise protests against all the affirmations by which\r\nGermany lyingly imputes to France or to its allies the responsibility\r\nfor the war.\r\n\r\nIt protests against all the negations opposed to the evident\r\nauthenticity of the abominable acts committed by the German armies.\r\n\r\nIn the name of French civilization and human civilization, it\r\nstigmatizes the violators of Belgian neutrality, the killers of women\r\nand children, the savage destroyers of noble monuments of the past,\r\nthe incendiaries of the University of Louvain, of the Cathedral of\r\nRheims, and those who wanted also to burn Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nIt expresses its enthusiasm for the armies that struggle against the\r\ncoalition of Germany and Austria.\r\n\r\nWith profound emotion it salutes our soldiers who, animated by the\r\nvirtues of our ancestors, are thus demonstrating the immortality of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n_When these words were published they may have appeared excessive to\r\ncertain minds outside of the best-informed circles.... Since then\r\ndiplomatic documents have appeared, followed by various official\r\nreports on German atrocities, and today the truth is known to all._\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 4.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH POINT OF VIEW.\r\n\r\n_On the 9th of November the President of the Council, M. Rene\r\nViviani, traveled to Rheims in order to deliver to the Mayor, M.\r\nLanglet, the Cross of the Legion of Honor that his courage had gained\r\nfor him. On this occasion the President of the Council pronounced the\r\ndiscourse from which the following is cited as exhibiting French\r\nthought on the present war:_\r\n\r\nAs if it were really necessary to accentuate the role of France,\r\nGerman militarism has raised its voice. It proclaims, through the\r\norgan of those whose mission it is to think for it, the cult of force\r\nand that history asks no accounts from the victor. We are not a\r\nchimerical people, nor dreamers, we do not despise force; only we put\r\nit in its place, which is at the service of the right. It is for the\r\nright that we are contending, for that Belgium is struggling by our\r\nside, she who sacrificed herself for honor; and for that, also, our\r\nEnglish and Russian allies whose armies, while waiting till they can\r\ntread this unchained force under foot, oppose it with an invincible\r\nrampart. France is not a preying country; it does not stretch out\r\nrapacious hands to enslave the world. Since war has been forced upon\r\nher, she makes war. Soon the legitimate reparations will come which\r\nshall restore to the French hearth the souls that the brutality of\r\narms separated from it. Associated in a work of human liberation we\r\nshall go on, allies and Frenchmen united in war and for peace, as long\r\nas we have not broken Prussian militarism and the sword of murder with\r\nthe sword of freedom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChronology of the War\r\n\r\nShowing Progress of Campaigns on All Fronts and Collateral Events from\r\nJune 15, 1915, Up to and Including July 15, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN IN EASTERN EUROPE\r\n\r\nJune 16--Austro-German drive toward Lemberg continues, although\r\nRussians are moving reinforcements to their retreating line;
