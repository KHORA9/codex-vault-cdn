II.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOUR WAR AND OUR WANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan this great republic of our forefathers exist with slavery in it?\r\n\r\nWhether we like or dislike the question, it must be answered. As the war\r\nstands, we have gone too far to retreat. It clamors for a brave and\r\nmanly solution. Let us see if we can, laying aside all prejudices, all\r\ndislikes whatever, discover an honest course, simply with a view to\r\npreserve the Union and insure its future prosperity. Let us avoid all\r\nforegone conclusions, all extraneous issues, adhering strictly to the\r\none great need of the hour--how to conquer the foe, reëstablish the\r\nUnion, and do this in a manner most consonant with our future national\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest enough that in a continent destined at no distant day to\r\ncontain its hundred millions, the question whether these shall form one\r\ngreat nation or a collection of smaller states is one of fearful\r\nimportance. He who belongs to a _great_ nation is thereby great of\r\nhimself. He has the right to be proud, and will work out his life more\r\nproudly and vigorously and freely than the dweller in a corner-country.\r\nDo those men ever _reflect_, who talk so glibly of this government as\r\ntoo large, and as one which must inevitably be sundered, to what a\r\ndegradation they calmly look forward! No; Union,--come what may,--now\r\nand ever. Greatness is to every brave man a _necessity_. Out on the\r\ncraven and base-hearted who aspire to being less than the co-rulers of a\r\ncontinent. See how vile and mean are those men who in the South have\r\nlost all national pride in a small-minded provincial attachment to a\r\nState, who love their local county better still, and concentrate their\r\nreal political interests in the feudal government of a plantation. Shall\r\n_we_ be as such,--_we_, the men who hold the destinies of a hemisphere\r\nwithin our grasp? Never,--God help us,--_never!_\r\n\r\nOn the basis of free labor we are pressing onward over the mighty West.\r\nTwo great questions now require grappling with. The one is, whether\r\nslavery shall henceforth be tolerated; the other, whether we shall\r\nstrengthen this great government of the Union so as to preserve it in\r\nfuture from the criminal intrigues of would-be seceding, ambitious men\r\nof no principle. Now is the time to decide.\r\n\r\nWe must not be blind to a great opportunity which may be lost, of\r\nforever quelling a foul nuisance which would, if neglected _now_, live\r\nforever. Do we not see, feel, and understand what sort of _white men_\r\nare developed by slavery, and do we intend to keep up such a race among\r\nus? _Do we want all this work to do over again_ every ten or five years\r\nor all the time? For a quarter of a century, slavery and nothing else\r\nhas kept us in a growing fever, and now that it has reached a crisis the\r\nquestion is whether we shall calm down the patient with cool rose-water.\r\nIn the crisis comes a physician who knows the constitution of his\r\npatient, and proposes searching remedies and a thorough cure,--and, lo!\r\nthe old nurse cries out that he is interfering and acting unwisely,\r\nthough he is quite as willing to adopt her cooling present solace as\r\nshe.\r\n\r\nIf we had walked over the war-course last spring without opposition,--if\r\nwe had conquered the South, would we have put an end to this trouble?\r\nDoes any one believe that we would? This is not now a question of the\r\nright to hold slaves, or the wrong of so doing. All of that old\r\nabolition jargon went out and died with the present aspect of the war.\r\nSo far as nine-tenths of the North ever cared, or do now care, slaves\r\nmight have hoed away down in Dixie, until supplanted, as they have been\r\nin the North, by the irrepressible advance of manufactures and small\r\nfarms, or by free labor. 'Keep your slaves and hold your tongues,' was,\r\nand would be now, our utterance. But they would not hold their tongues.\r\nIt was 'rule or ruin' with them. And if, as it seems, a man can not hold\r\nslaves without being arrogant and unjust to others, we must take his\r\nslaves away.\r\n\r\nAnd why is not this the proper time to urge emancipation? Divested of\r\nall deceitful and evasive turns, the question reduces itself to\r\nthis,--are we to definitely conquer the enemy once and for all, the\r\ngreat enemy Oligarchy, by taking out its very heart? or are we to keep\r\nup this strife with slaveholders forever? It is a great and hard thing\r\nto do, this crushing the difficulty, but we must either do it or be done\r\nfor. In a few months 'the tax-gatherer will be around.' If anybody has\r\nread the report of the Secretary of the Treasury without a grave\r\nsensation, he is very fortunate. How would such reports please us\r\nannually for many years? So long as there exists in the Union a body of\r\nmen disowning allegiance to it, puffed up in pride, loathing and\r\nscorning the name of free labor, especially as the ally of capital, just\r\nso long will the tax-gatherer be around,--and with a larger bill than\r\never.\r\n\r\nTo such an extent is this arrogance carried of urging utter silence at\r\npresent on the subject of slavery, that one might almost question\r\nwhether the right of free speech or thought is to be left at all, save\r\nto those who have determined on a certain course of conduct. When it is\r\nremembered that those who wish to definitely conclude this great\r\nnational trouble are in the great majority, we stand amazed at the\r\npresumption which forbids them to utter a word. One may almost distrust\r\nhis senses to hear it so brazenly urged that because he happens to think\r\nthat our fighting and victories may go hand in hand with a measure which\r\nis to prevent future war, he is 'opposed to the Administration,' is 'a\r\nselfish traitor thinking of nothing but the Nigger,' and altogether a\r\nstumbling-block and an untimely meddler. If he protest that he cares no\r\nmore for the welfare of the Negro than for that of the man in the moon,\r\nhe is still reviled as an 'abolitionist.' If he insist that emancipation\r\nwill end the war, his 'conservative' foe becomes pathetic over his\r\nindifference as to what is to become of the four millions of 'poor\r\nblacks.' And, in short, when he urges the great question whether this\r\ncountry is to tolerate slavery or no, he is met with trivial fribbling\r\nside-issues, every one of which _should_ vanish like foam before the\r\ndetermined will and onward march of a great, _free_ people.\r\n\r\nNow let every friend of the Union boldly assume that _so far as the\r\nsettlement of this question is concerned he_ does not care one straw for\r\nthe Negro. Leave the Negro out altogether. Let him sink or swim, so far\r\nas this difficulty goes. Men have tried for thirty years to appeal to\r\nhumanity, without success, for the Negro, and now let us try some other\r\nexpedient. Let us regard him not as a man and a brother, but as 'a\r\nmiserable nigger,' if you please, and a nuisance. But whatever he be, if\r\nthe effect of owning such creatures is to make the owner an intolerable\r\nfellow, seditious and insolent, it becomes pretty clear that such\r\nownership should be put an end to. If Mr. Smith can not have a horse\r\nwithout riding over his neighbor, it is quite time that Smith were\r\nunhorsed, no matter how honestly he may have acquired the animal. And if\r\nthe Smiths, father and sons, threaten to keep their horse in spite of\r\nlaw,--nay, and breed up a race of horses from him, whereon to roughride\r\neverybody who goes afoot,--then it becomes still more imperative that\r\nthe Smith family cease cavaliering it altogether.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another point which the stanch Union-lover must keep in\r\nview. In pushing on the war with heart and soul, we inevitably render\r\nslaveholding at any rate a most precarious institution, and one likely\r\nto be broken up altogether. Seeing this, many unreflectingly ask, 'Why\r\nthen meddle with it?' But it _must_ be considered in some way, and\r\nprovided for as the war advances, or we shall find ourselves in such an\r\nimbroglio as history never saw the like of. He who cuts down a tree must\r\ntake forethought how it may fall, or he will perchance find himself\r\ncrushed. He who in a tremendous conflagration would blow up a block of\r\nhouses with powder, must, even amid the riot and roar, so manage the\r\nexplosion that lives be not wantonly lost. We must clear the chips away\r\nas our work advances. The matter in hand is the war--if you choose,\r\nnothing but the war. But pushing on singly and simply at _the war_\r\nimplies _some_ wisdom and a certain regard to the future and to\r\nconsequences. The mere abolitionist of the old school, who regards the\r\nConstitution as a league with death and a covenant with hell, may, if he\r\npleases, see in the war only an opportunity to wreak vengeance on the\r\nSouth and free the black. But the 'emancipationist' sees this in a very\r\ndifferent light. He sees that we are _not_ fighting for the Negro, or\r\nout of hatred to anybody. He knows that we are fighting to restore the\r\nUnion, and that this is the first great thought, to be carried out at\r\n_all_ hazards. But he feels that this carrying out involves some action\r\nat the same time on the great trouble which first caused the war, and\r\nwhich, if neglected, will prolong the war forever. He feels that the\r\nfuture of the greatest republic in existence depends on settling this\r\nquestion now and forever, and that if it be left to the chances of war\r\nto settle itself, there is imminent danger that even a victory may not\r\nprevent a disrupture of the Union. For, disguise it as we may, there is\r\na vast and uncontrollable body at the North who hate slavery, and pity\r\nthe black, and these men will not be silent or inactive. Did the\r\nelection of Abraham Lincoln involve nothing of this? We know that it\r\ndid. Will this 'extreme left,' this radical party, keep quiet and do\r\nnothing? Why they are the most fiercely active men on our continent. Let\r\nhim who would prevent this battle degenerating into a furious strife\r\nbetween radical abolition and its opponents weigh this matter well.\r\nThere are fearful elements at work, which may be neutralized, if we who\r\nfight for the _Union_ will be wise betimes, and remove the bone of\r\ncontention.\r\n\r\nAbove all, let every man bear in mind that, even as the war stands,\r\nsomething _must_ be done to regulate and settle the Negro question.\r\nAfter what has been already effected in the border States and South\r\nCarolina, it would be impossible to leave the Negro and his owner in\r\nsuch an undefined relation as now exists. And yet this very fact--one of\r\nthe strongest which can be alleged to prove the necessity of legislation\r\nand order--is cited to prove that the matter will settle itself. Take,\r\nfor instance, the following from the correspondence of a daily\r\ncotemporary:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE ARMY SPOILING THE SLAVES.--Whatever may be the policy of the\r\n     government in regard to the status of the slaves, one thing is\r\n     certain, that wherever our army goes, it will most effectually\r\n     spoil all the slaves and render them worthless to their masters.\r\n     This will be the necessary result, and we think it perfectly\r\n     useless to disturb the administration and distract the minds of the\r\n     people with the everlasting discussion of this topic. Soon our army\r\n     will be in Georgia, Florida, and Louisiana, and the soldiers will\r\n     carry with their successful arms an element of liberty that will\r\n     infuse itself into every slave in those States. The only hope for\r\n     the South, if, indeed, it has not passed away, is to throw down\r\n     their arms and submit unconditionally to the government.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, we are to free the slave, only we must not say so!\r\nRather than take a bold, manly stand, avow what we are actually doing,\r\nand adopt a measure which would at once conciliate and harmonize the\r\nwhole North, we are to suffer a tremendous disorder to spring up and\r\nmake mischief without end! Can we never get over this silly dread of\r\nworn-out political abuse and grapple fairly with the truth? Are we\r\nreally so much afraid of being falsely called abolitionists and\r\nnegro-lovers that we can not act and think like _men!_ Here we are\r\nfrightened at _names_, dilly-dallying and quarreling over idle words,\r\nwhen a tremendous crisis calls for acts. But this can not last forever.\r\nSomething must be done right speedily for the myriad of blacks whom we\r\nshall soon have on our hands. Barracooning contrabands by thousands may\r\ndo for the present, but how as to the morrow? Let it be repeated again\r\nand again, that they who argue against touching the Negro question _at\r\npresent_ are putting off from day to day an evil which becomes terrible\r\nas it is delayed. It can _not_ be let alone. Already those in power at\r\nWashington are terrified at its extent, but fear to act, owing to\r\n'abolition,' while all the time the foul old political ties and\r\nintrigues are gathering closely about. Let us cut the knot betimes, act\r\nbravely and manfully, and settle the difficulty ere it settles us.\r\nSomething must be done, and that right early.\r\n\r\nBut what is to become of the freed blacks? Again and again does this\r\npreposterous bugbear rise up to prove, by the terror which it excites,\r\nthe vast ignorance of the subject which prevails in this country, and\r\nthe small amount of deliberate reasoning generally bestowed on matters\r\nof the most vital importance. Reader, if you would answer it, go to\r\nfacts. You have probably all your life accepted as true the statement\r\nthat the black when free promptly becomes an idle, worthless vagabond.\r\nYou have believed that a _majority_ of the free blacks in the North are\r\ngood for nothing. Now I tell you calmly and deliberately, and\r\nchallenging inquiry, that _this is not true_. Admitting that about\r\none-fifth of them are so, you have but a weak argument. As for the\r\nforlorn, unacclimated exiles in Canada, where there is no demand for the\r\nlabor which they are peculiarly fit to render, they are not a case in\r\npoint. The black servants, cooks, barbers, white-washers, carpet-beaters\r\nand grooms of Baltimore and Philadelphia, which form the four-fifths\r\nmajority of free blacks in those cities, are not idle vagabonds. Above\r\nall, reader, I beg of you to read the dispassionate and calmly written\r\n_Cotton Kingdom_ of Frederick Law Olmstead, recently published by Mason\r\nBrothers, of New York. You will there find the fact set forth by closest\r\nobservation that the negroes in part are indeed lazy vagabonds, but that\r\nthe majority, when allowed to work for themselves, and when free, _do_\r\nwork, and that right steadily. In the Virginia tobacco factories slaves\r\ncan earn on an average as much money for themselves, in the 'over hours'\r\nallowed them, as the manufacturer pays their owner for their services\r\nduring the day. There are cases in which slaves, hired for one hundred\r\ndollars a year, have made for themselves three hundred.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: 'If the slaves be emancipated, what with their own natural\r\nability and such aids and appliances as the government and 20,000,000 of\r\npeople in the North can furnish, I do not believe but that they will get\r\nemployment, and pay, and, of course, subsistence.'--HON. GEORGE S.\r\nBOUTWELL.]\r\n\r\nBut the vagabond surplus,--the minority? Is it possible that with Union\r\nor disunion before us we can hesitate as to taking on this incumbrance?\r\nIn a hard-working land vagabonds must die off,--'tis a hard case, but\r\nthe emergency for the white men of this and a coming age is much harder.\r\nAfter all, there are only some fifteen hundred or two thousand lazy free\r\nnegroes in New York city,--the climate, we are told, is too severe for\r\nthem,--and this among well-nigh a million of inhabitants. We think it\r\nwould be possible to find one single alderman in that city who has\r\nwasted as much capital, and injured the commonwealth quite as much, in\r\none year, as all the negroes there put together, during the same time.\r\nIt would be absurd to imagine that the emancipation of every negro in\r\nAmerica to-morrow would add one million idlers and vagabonds to our\r\npopulation. _But what if it did?_ Would their destiny or injury to us be\r\nof such tremendous importance that we need for it peril our welfare as a\r\nnation? The standing armies of Germany absorb about one-fifth of the\r\nentire capital of the land. Better one million of negative negroes than\r\na million of positive soldiers!\r\n\r\nThere was never yet in history a time when such a glorious future\r\noffered itself to a nation as that which is now within our grasp. In its\r\ngreatness and splendor it is beyond all description. The great problem\r\nof Republicanism--the question of human progress--has reached its last\r\ntrial. If we keep this mighty nation one and inseparable, we shall have\r\nanswered it forever; if not, why then those who revile man as vile and\r\nirreclaimably degraded may raise their pæans of triumph; the black\r\nspectres of antique tyrants may clap their hands gleefully in the land\r\nof accursed shadows, and hell hold high carnival, for, verily, it would\r\nseem as if they had triumphed, and that hope were a lie.\r\n\r\nBut who are they who dare accuse us of wishing to weaken the\r\nadministration and impede its course? Bring the question to light! If\r\nthere be one thing more than another which those who demand emancipation\r\ndesire, it is that the central government should be _strengthened_--aye,\r\nstrengthened as it has never been before; so that, in future, there can\r\nbe no return of secession. We have never been a republic--only an\r\naggregate of smaller republics. If we _had_ been one, the first movement\r\ntoward disunion would have hurled the traitors urging it to the dust.\r\nAye, strengthen the government; and let its first manifestation of\r\nstrength and will be the settling of the negro question. Give the\r\nadministration as full power as you please--the more the better; it is\r\nonly conferring strength on the people. There is no danger that the men\r\nof the North will ever lose a shadow of individual rights. They are too\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\nAnd now let the freemen of America speak, and the work will be done. A\r\ngreat day is at hand; hasten it. The hour which sees this Union\r\nre-united will witness the most glorious triumph of humanity,--the\r\ngreatest step towards realizing the social aim of Christianity, and of\r\nHim who died for all,--the recognition of the rights of every one.\r\nOnward!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBROWN'S LECTURE TOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--HOW HE CAME TO DO IT.\r\n\r\nMy last speculation had proved a failure. I was left with a stock of\r\nfifty impracticable washing-machines on my hands, and a cash capital of\r\nforty-four cents. With the furniture of my room, these constituted my\r\ntotal assets. I had an unsettled account of forty dollars with Messrs.\r\nRoller & Ems, printers, for washing-machine circulars, cards, etc.;\r\nand--\r\n\r\nRap, rap, rap!\r\n\r\n[_Enter boy_.]\r\n\r\n'Mr. Peck says as how you'll please call around to his office and settle\r\nup this afternoon, sure.'\r\n\r\n[_Exit boy_.]\r\n\r\n  _New York, Nov. 30, 1859_.\r\n\r\n  Mr. GREEN D. BROWN,\r\n\r\n  _TO_ JOHN PECK, _Dr_.\r\n\r\n  _To Rent of Room to date_     $9 00\r\n\r\n  _Rec'd Pay't_,\r\n\r\nI came to the emphatic conclusion that I was 'hard up.'\r\n\r\nI kept bachelor's hall in Franklin Street, in apartments not altogether\r\nsumptuous, yet sufficiently so for my purposes,--to wit, to sit in and\r\nto sleep in; and inasmuch as I took my meals amid the gilded splendors\r\nof the big saloon on the corner of Broadway, I was not disposed to\r\nreproach myself with squalor. Yet the articles of furniture in my room\r\nwere so far removed, separately or in the aggregate, from anything like\r\nthe superfluous, that when I calmly deliberated what to part with, there\r\nwas nothing which struck me as a luxury or a comfort as distinct from a\r\nnecessary of life. I took a second mental inventory: two common chairs,\r\na table, a mirror, a rocking-chair, a bed, a lounge, and a single\r\npicture on the wall.\r\n\r\nI declare, thought I, here's nothing to spare.\r\n\r\nBut things were getting to a crisis. I must 'make a raise,' somehow.\r\nBorrow? Ah, certainly--where was the benevolent moneyed individual? My\r\ncredit had gone with my cash; both were sunk in the washing-machines.\r\n\r\nI lighted my pipe, and surveyed my household goods once more.\r\n\r\nThere was the picture: couldn't I do without that?\r\n\r\nPossibly. But that picture I had had--let me see--fifteen, yes, sixteen\r\nyears. That picture was a third prize for excellence in declamation,\r\npresented me at the school exhibition in ---- Street, when I was twelve\r\nyears old. That was in 1843, and here, on the first of December, 1859, I\r\nsat deliberately meditating its sale for paltry bread and butter!\r\n\r\nNo, no; I'd go hungry a little longer, before I'd part with that old\r\nrelic--remembrancer of the proudest day of my life. What a pity I hadn't\r\npermitted that day to give a direction to my life, instead of turning my\r\nattention to the paltry expedients for money-making followed by the\r\ncommon herd! I might have been an accomplished orator by this time,\r\ncapable of drawing crowds and pocketing a thousand a month, or so. But\r\nmy tastes had run in other channels since the day when I took that\r\nprize.\r\n\r\nStill, when I thought of it deliberately, I made bold to believe there\r\nwas that yet in me which could meet the expectant eyes of audiences nor\r\nquail before them.\r\n\r\nA thought struck me! Was not here an 'opening' for an enterprising young\r\nman? Was not the lecture-season at hand? Did not lecturers get from ten\r\nto two hundred dollars per night? Couldn't I talk off a lecture with the\r\nbest of them, perhaps? Well, perhaps I could, and perhaps not, but if I\r\nwouldn't try it on, I hoped I might be blessed--that--was all.\r\n\r\nI thought proper, after having reached this conclusion, to calculate my\r\nwealth in the way of preliminary requisites to success. By preliminary\r\nrequisites to success, I mean those which lead to the securing of\r\ninvitations to lecture. I flattered myself that all matters consequent\r\nto this point in my career would very readily turn themselves to my\r\nadvantage. The preliminary requisites were as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. _Notoriety_. I could boast of nothing in this line. I had no\r\nreputation whatever. I had never written a line for publication.\r\n\r\nWhen I had satisfied myself that I lacked this grand requisite, I turned\r\nmy attention to the subject again only to find that No. 1 was quite\r\nalone in its glory. It was the Alpha and Omega of the preliminary\r\nrequisites. I should never be able to get a solitary invitation.\r\n\r\nHere I was for a moment disheartened; but, persevering in my\r\nnewly-assumed part of literary philosopher, I proceeded to the\r\nconsideration of the consequent requisites:--\r\n\r\n1. _Literary ability_. To say the truth, my literary abilities had\r\nhitherto been kept in the background. I was glad they were now going to\r\ncome forward. For present purposes, it was sufficient that the Astor\r\nLibrary was handy, and that I could string words together respectably.\r\n\r\n2. _Oratorical ability_. As already indicated, I was conscious of no\r\nmean alloy of the Demosthenic gold tempering the baser metal of my\r\ngeneral composition. My voice was deep and strong.\r\n\r\n3. _Facial brass_. I felt brazen enough to set up a bell-foundery on my\r\npersonal curve. My cheeks were of that metalline description that never\r\nknew a blush, before an audience of one or many.\r\n\r\n4. _Personal appearance_. I consulted my mirror on that point. It showed\r\nme a young man of only twenty-eight, and tall and shapely proportions; a\r\nwell-dressed young man, with light-colored hair, prominent nose, and\r\nheavy red beard and moustache. I twisted the latter institution\r\nundecidedly, and ventured the belief that by shaving myself clean and\r\nbridging my nose with a pair of black-bowed spectacles I could pass\r\nmuster.\r\n\r\nThe result total was satisfactory. I resolved to disregard the\r\npreliminary respecting invitations, and to make a modest effort of my\r\nown to secure an audience, by going into the country, and advertising\r\nmyself in proper form. I commenced the work of writing a lecture\r\nforthwith; and in a few days I had ready what I deemed a rather superior\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--HOW HE PROCEEDED TO DO IT.\r\n\r\nI gave up my lodgings in town, sold all my salable possessions, settled\r\nup with my landlord, paid my printers in the usual way (i.e., with\r\npromises), and, supplied with a satchel-full of hand-bills (from a rival\r\nestablishment), started for the country. My ticket was for Sidon--a\r\nplace I knew nothing whatever about; the only circumstance of a positive\r\ncharacter connected with it was, that it was the farthest point from New\r\nYork which I could reach by the Rattle and Smash Railroad for the net\r\namount of funds in my pocket. I stepped into the streets of Sidon with a\r\nlight heart, and looked out on the scene of my contemplated triumph. I\r\nmade up my mind at once that if ancient Sidon was no more of a place\r\nthan modern Sidon, it couldn't lay claim to being much of a town. The\r\nhouses, including shops and stores, would not exceed one hundred. I\r\nwalked to the tavern, and delivered my satchel to the custody of a\r\nrough-looking animal, whom I subsequently found to be landlord, hostler,\r\nbar-tender, table-waiter, and general manager-at-all-work. He was a very\r\nuninviting subject; but, being myself courteously inclined, and having\r\nalso a brisk eye to business, I inquired if there was a public hall or\r\nlecture-room in the place.\r\n\r\n'I've got a dance-hall up-stairs. Be you a showman?'\r\n\r\nI said I was a lecturer by profession, and asked if churches were ever\r\nused for such purposes in Sidon.\r\n\r\n'Never heard of any. 'Ain't got no church. Be you goin' to lecter?'\r\n\r\nI replied that I thought some of it, and inquired if it was common to\r\nuse his hall for lectures.\r\n\r\n'Wal, Sidon ain't much of a place for shows anyhow. When they is any, I\r\ngit 'em in, if they ain't got no tent o' their own.'\r\n\r\nI would look at the hall.\r\n\r\nWe went up a rickety stairway, into a dingy room. The plaster had fallen\r\nfrom the ceiling in several places, and the room had a mouldy smell.\r\nThere was a platform at one end, where the musicians sat when saltatory\r\n_fêtes_ were held, and on this I mounted to 'take a view.' I didn't feel\r\ncalled upon to admire the hall in audible terms; but as I stood there an\r\ninspiring scene arose before my mental vision--a scene of up-turned\r\nfaces, each representing the sum of fifteen cents, that being the\r\nregular swindle for getting into shows round here, the landlord said. I\r\nstruck a bargain for the hall, at once--a bargain by which I was to have\r\nit for two dollars if I didn't do very well, or five dollars if I had a\r\nregular big crowd; bill-stickers and doorkeeper included, free.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, I went to the village post-office, which was merely a\r\ncorner of the village store, and inquired if there was a letter there\r\nfor Professor Green D. Brown. I knew very well there was not, of course,\r\nbut I had the not unexpected pleasure of seeing the postmaster's eyes\r\ndilate inquiringly, so that I felt called upon to say:--\r\n\r\n'I am a stranger, sir, in Sidon, at present, but I hope to enjoy the\r\nhonor of making the acquaintance of a large number of your intelligent\r\ncitizens during my brief stay with you. I propose lecturing in this\r\nvillage to-morrow evening, on a historical, or perhaps I should say\r\nbiographical, subject.'\r\n\r\nThe postmaster, who appeared like an intelligent gentleman, said he was\r\nglad to see me, and glad to hear I was going to lecture; and he shook\r\nhands with me cordially. The store contained about half the adult\r\npopulation of the village, lounging about the warm stove, talking and\r\ndozing; and the postmaster introduced me to Squire Johnson, and Dr.\r\nTomson, and Mr. Dickson, and Mr. Dobson and Mr. Potkins, who, five,\r\nconstituted the upper ten of Sidon. With these gentlemen I held a very\r\nentertaining conversation, during which I remember I was struck with the\r\nextreme deference paid to my opinion, and the extreme contempt\r\nmanifested for the opinions of each other. They all agreed, however,\r\nthat my visit would be likely to prove of the greatest importance to\r\nSidon in a literary and educational point of view.\r\n\r\nI returned to the hotel, and retired with heart elate.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, it was with emotions of a peculiarly pleasurable nature\r\nthat I observed, profusely plastered on posts and fences, the\r\nannouncement, in goodly capitals:--\r\n\r\n  LECTURE!!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  PROF. G.D. BROWN,\r\n\r\n  OF NEW YORK CITY,\r\n\r\n  WILL LECTURE THIS EVENING, DECEMBER 14,\r\n\r\n  IN JONES'S HALL, SIDON,\r\n\r\n  AT 7 O'CLOCK.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  SUBJECT: 'EURIPIDES, THE ATHENIAN POET.'\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  ADMISSION 15 CENTS. DOORS OPEN AT 6 O'CLOCK.\r\n\r\nThe critical reader may experience a desire to propound to me a\r\nquestion:--'Professor of what?'\r\n\r\nNow I profess honesty, as an abstract principle--being, perhaps the\r\nconscientious reader will think, more of a professor than a practicer\r\nherein. But the truth is, in the present mendicant state of the word\r\n'Professor,' I conceived I had a perfect right and title to it, by\r\nvirtue of my poverty, and so appropriated it for the behoof and\r\nadvantage of Number One. Which explanation, it is hoped, will do.\r\n\r\nFriday passed in cultivating still farther the acquaintance of the\r\nprevious evening, and receiving the most cordial assurances of interest\r\non their part in my visit and its object. I was candidly (and I thought\r\nkindly) informed by my good friends, not to get my expectations too\r\nhigh, as a very large house could scarcely, they feared, be expected;\r\nbut I deemed an audience of even no more than fifty or seventy-five a\r\nfair beginning,--a very fair beginning,--and had no fears.\r\n\r\nI retired to my room at five o'clock, and remained locked in, with my\r\nlecture before me, oblivious of all external affairs, until a few\r\nminutes past seven, when I concluded my audience had gathered. I then\r\nsmoothed my hair, adjusted my spectacles, took my MS. in my hand, and\r\nproceeded to the lecture-room. The doorkeeper was fast asleep, and the\r\nlong wicks of the tallow candles were flaring wildly and dimly on a\r\nscene of emptiness. Not an auditor was present!\r\n\r\nI descended to the bar-room. It was full of loungers, smoking, dozing,\r\nand drinking. Without entering, I hastened across the way to the\r\npost-office. There was the courteous postmaster, engaged in a sleepy\r\ntalk with Squire Johnson and Dr. Tomson and Mr. Dickson and Mr. Dobson\r\nand Mr. Potkins, who sat precisely as they sat the evening previous.\r\n\r\nI returned to the hotel and called out the landlord.\r\n\r\n'There's no audience, I perceive,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Wal, I didn't cal'late much of anybody'd go in. They gen'ally go over\r\nto Tyre when they want shows. Tyre's quite a town. You'd do better over\r\nthar; 's on'y seven mile over to Tyre.'\r\n\r\nI explained my position to the landlord at once, and threw myself on his\r\nmercy. I told him I had no money, but would walk over to Tyre that very\r\nevening, rather than task his hospitality longer. After making a little\r\nmoney in Tyre, I would return to Sidon and settle his little bill. To\r\nwhich the generous-hearted fellow responded,--\r\n\r\n'Yas, I think likely; but ye see I'm _some_ on gettin' my pay outen\r\nthese show chaps that go round. I reckon that thar satchel o' yourn's\r\ngot the wuth o' my bill in it. I'll hold on to it till ye git back, ye\r\nknow.'\r\n\r\nRemonstrance was in vain. I found that my sharp landlord had entered my\r\nroom while I was looking in at the post-office door, and had taken my\r\ncarpet-bag, with everything I had, even my overcoat, and stowed all in a\r\ncupboard under the bar, under lock and key. He would not so much as\r\nallow me a clean shirt; and I started for Tyre, wishing from the bottom\r\nof my heart that the inhuman landlord might engage in a washing-machine\r\nspeculation, and involve with himself Mr. Potkins and Mr. Dobson and Mr.\r\nDickson and Dr. Tomson and Squire Johnson.\r\n\r\nI reached Tyre at ten o'clock, and found that I had not been deceived\r\nrespecting its size. It was quite a large Tillage, with well laid out\r\nstreets, handsome residences, two large hotels, and three or four\r\nchurches. I took this inventory of the principal objects in Tyre with\r\nconsiderable more anxiety than I had ever supposed it possible for me to\r\nentertain concerning any country town in Christendom. I was interested\r\nin the prosperity of Tyre. I sincerely hoped that the hard times had not\r\nentered its quiet and beautiful streets. The streets certainly were both\r\nquiet and beautiful, as I looked upon them in the clear moonlight of ten\r\no'clock at night, an hour when honest people in the country are, for the\r\nmost part, asleep. I entered the handsomest of the hotels, and\r\nregistered my name in a bran-new book on the clerk's counter.\r\n\r\n  Name.\r\n\r\n  Residence.\r\n\r\n  Destination.\r\n\r\n  _Prof. D.G. Brown,\r\n  N.Y. City.\r\n  Lecture in Tyre_.\r\n\r\n'Beautiful evening, sir,' said the clerk, who was also the landlord, but\r\nnot also the bar-tender and the hostler.\r\n\r\n'You are right, sir,' said I; 'it is truly a lovely evening. I have\r\nrarely seen moonlight so beautiful. Indeed, such were the beauties of\r\nthe evening, that I have positively been tempted so far as to walk over\r\nhere from Sidon this evening, leaving my baggage to follow me in the\r\nmorning.'\r\n\r\n'Ah! lectured in Sidon perhaps?'\r\n\r\n'Well, ah! um! yes; that is, I intend to do so, but unforeseen\r\ncircumstances induced me to relinquish that purpose. Sidon is very\r\nsmall.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, small place. Never heard of a lecture, or any kind of a\r\nperformance, there before. Fact is, they're a hard set over to Sidon,\r\nand the place is better known by the name of Sodom around here.'\r\n\r\nI felt much encouraged at hearing this; for, to tell the truth, my\r\ncogitations as I tramped over the rough road between Tyre and Sidon had\r\nbeen anything but cheerful. This was a realization of my fond dreams of\r\na ten-to-fifty-dollars-a-night lecture tour, such as I had hardly\r\nanticipated, and as I drew nigh unto Tyre I had been thinking whether I\r\nhad not better try to get a situation as a farm-hand or dry-goods clerk\r\nbefore my troubles should have crushed me and driven me to suicide.\r\n\r\nBut the landlord cheered me. Tyre was a model town. Tyre had a\r\nnewspaper, and Tyre patronized literary entertainments. There was a good\r\nhall in Tyre, and the Tyrians had filled it to overflowing last winter\r\nwhen Chapin spoke there. I went to bed under the benignant influence of\r\nmy cheerful host, and dreamed of lecturing to an audience of many\r\nthousands in a hall a trifle larger than the Academy of Music, and with\r\nevery nook and corner crowded with enthusiastic listeners, whose joy\r\nculminated with my peroration into such a tumult of delight that they\r\nrushed upon the stage and hoisted me on their shoulders amid cheers so\r\nboisterous that they awoke me. I found I had left my bed and mounted\r\ninto a window, with the intention, doubtless, of stepping into the\r\nstreet and concluding my career at once, lest an anti-climax should be\r\nmy fate.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, I called on the editor of the newspaper.\r\n\r\nI desire to recommend my reader to subscribe at once to _The Tyre\r\nTimes_, and thus aid to sustain the paper of a gentleman and a scholar,\r\nwho was, as editors usually are, a plain-spoken, sensible man, conscious\r\nof the presence of talent in his sanctum, by 'sympathetic attraction.'\r\nThe editor of the _Times_ looked into the circumstances of my case with\r\nan experienced and kindly eye, and then said to me,--\r\n\r\n'My dear sir, you can not succeed here with a lecture. We have had\r\nseveral in our village within a few years, but never one which 'paid,'\r\nunless it was one on phrenology, or physiology, or psychology, and\r\nplentifully spiced with humor of the coarsest sort. If you want to make\r\nmoney in Tyre, you'll take my advice and get a two-headed calf, a\r\nlearned pig, or a band of nigger minstrels. Any of these things will\r\nanswer your purpose, if you want money; but if you have ambition to\r\ngratify, if you want to lecture for the sake of lecturing, that's a\r\ndifferent thing. At all events, you shall have my good wishes, and I'll\r\ndo all I can to get you a house. But it won't pay.'\r\n\r\nThe reader knows that if I had not been a fool I would have understood\r\nand heeded a statement so plain as this, made by an editor. But then, if\r\nI hadn't been a fool, you know I should never have started on a lecture\r\ntour at all. So, being a fool, I had bills printed, hired a hall (at ten\r\ndollars), and was duly announced to lecture in Tyre on the coming\r\nTuesday evening. The same afternoon, _The Tyre Times_ appeared, and its\r\neditorial column contained the following notice, which I read with great\r\ninterest, it being my first appearance in any periodical:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     LECTURE AT GRECIAN HALL.--We take pleasure in announcing that Prof.\r\n     GREEN D. BROWN, of New York city, will favor the citizens of Tyre\r\n     with a lecture on Tuesday evening next. From what we know of the\r\n     gentleman, we are satisfied our citizens will not regret attending\r\n     the lecture. We trust he may not be met with an audience so small\r\n     as lectures have heretofore drawn out in Tyre. The apathy of our\r\n     citizens in these matters, we have before stated, is disgraceful.\r\n     Let there be a good turn-out.\r\n\r\nBut there was not a good turn-out. The receipts were two dollars and a\r\nhalf. The proprietor of the hall consented to take the receipts for his\r\npay, and I returned to the hotel to muse over my unhappy fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe landlord took occasion the next morning, as I was passing out of the\r\nhouse, to remind me that my baggage had not arrived.\r\n\r\n'No,' said I, 'but, as I soon leave Tyre, I shan't need it.'\r\n\r\nThe landlord looked at my dirty collar and bosom as if he doubted either\r\nmy sanity or my decency, and remarked that perhaps I knew his rules\r\ncompelled him to present the bills of strangers semi-weekly.\r\n\r\n'O, yes! that's all right,' said I; 'I'll see you when I come back from\r\nthe printing-office.'\r\n\r\nI noticed that mine host stood watching to see that I entered the\r\nprinting-office safely.\r\n\r\nThe editor remarked, after I had told him all the experience narrated\r\nhere, commencing with the washing-machines,--\r\n\r\n'It's a bad case, and I don't admire your experience at all, to speak\r\ncandidly; but I have a little idea of my own to work out, and you can\r\nhelp me do it, perhaps. In the first place, though, I want to know\r\nwhether you intend to continue in this line of business,--eh?'\r\n\r\n'Not I,' was my fervent reply; 'I'm satisfied to leave lecturing to\r\nthose who have a reputation, and to earn my bread and butter in a, for\r\nme, more legitimate way. But what is it you have in view?'\r\n\r\n'Come and see me this evening, when I am at leisure, and I'll tell you\r\nwhat my enterprise is. Meantime, will you sell me your lecture? I can't\r\nafford to pay much for it, but I'll agree to settle your hotel bill if\r\nyou'll part with it. Not that I think it's worth it, but you need to be\r\nhelped somehow right away.'\r\n\r\nI jumped at the chance, and thanked my friend heartily. He asked if I\r\nwould please go and send the landlord to him, and I retired to perform\r\nthat errand.\r\n\r\nI was punctual to my appointment in the evening, and listened to the\r\nproject my editorial angel had in view; a plan by which he proposed to\r\ninflict a lesson on the negligent Tyrians, and at the same time\r\nreplenish my purse. He explained to me the part I was to perform in this\r\nenterprise, and I found I could enter heartily into the spirit of it. We\r\nshook hands in the best of humors, and parted that evening understanding\r\neach other perfectly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--HE MAKES A HIT IN TYRE.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the entire jobbing facilities of the _Times_ office were\r\nbrought into requisition, and toward evening a mammoth bill was posted\r\naround the town, which read as follows:--\r\n\r\n    MONS. BELITZ'S\r\n    CELEBRATED AND MAGNIFICENT EXHIBITION,\r\n    THE GREAT TRAVELING HUMBURG!\r\n    The most wonderful entertainment, whether\r\n    CAININE, PRISTINE, OR QUININE,\r\n    ever brought before the astonished Public's visual organs!!!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The _avant courier_ of this monster troupe has the honor of\r\n    announcing to the ladies and gentlemen of Tyre, that Mons. BELITZ,\r\n    accompanied by his entire retinue of attachés and supes, Female\r\n    Dancers and Dogs, Operatic Vocalists and Vixens, Royal Musicians and\r\n    Monsters, Bengal Tigers and Time-servers, Magicians and Madmen,\r\n    Flying Birds, Swimming Fishes, Walking Cats and Dogs, Crawling\r\n    Reptiles, and various other extraordinary and impossible\r\n    arrangements, the like of which never before appeared in Bog county,\r\n    until the arrival of the present occasion, to wit:--\r\n\r\n    AT GRECIAN HALL, TYRE,\r\n\r\n    On Saturday Evening, December 22, 1859.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     ---> LOOK AT THE ARRAY OF TALENT! <---\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    MONS. BELITZ,\r\n    the celebrated Magician from Egypt, performer general to\r\n\r\n    THE GRAND FOO FOO,\r\n    and professor of the Black Art to all the crowned heads of the\r\n    Cannibal Islands and Ham Sandwichlands!!\r\n\r\n    MADEMOISELLE HELIOTROPE,\r\n    the charming Danseuse from all the city theatres, but most recently\r\n    from the Imperial _Deutscher Yolks Garten_, Liverpool, Ireland!\r\n\r\n    SIGNOR STRAWSTEKOWSKI,\r\n    the celebrated Demagogue and Snake eater, whose unrivaled feat with\r\n    a living _Gryllus_, whose fangs have never been extracted, fills\r\n    thousands with awe and delight!\r\n\r\n    YANKEE SHOCKWIG,\r\n    the mirth-splitting and side-provoking delineator of down-east horse\r\n    peculiarities. Must be appreciated to be seen.\r\n\r\n    HERR BALAMSASS,\r\n    the distinguished Vocalist from Italy, whose lower notes, as\r\n    recently discovered by the celebrated examination before the Council\r\n    of Trent, reach so far below the _epigastrium_ as to be utterly\r\n    inaudible to the most acute auricular organs!\r\n\r\n    BRUDDER GEORGE AND AUNTY CLAWSON,\r\n    the never-to-be-sufficiently-equaled delineators of Ethiopian\r\n    eccentricities, whose performances during the winter of 1869\r\n    delighted overflowing houses in the Cape Cod Lunatic Asylum for 4000\r\n    consecutive nights.\r\n\r\n    BENJAMIN BOLT, Esq.,\r\n    the justly-celebrated trumpeter from the splendid orchestral band\r\n    attached to Marnum's Buseum, New York city, for the past fifty\r\n    years!\r\n\r\n    FANTADIMO FANTODIMUS,\r\n    the graceful and efficient master of ceremonies, whose efforts have\r\n    been awarded by the entire available population of Blackwell's\r\n    Island, in a series of resolutions of the most pathetic description!\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Owing to future engagements, the stay of this troupe in Tyre will be\r\n    POSITIVELY FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY, when the Programme will be specified\r\n    in small bills of the evening.\r\n\r\n    Admittance, 25 cents. Doors open at 6; Master of Ceremonies makes\r\n    his bow at 7.\r\n\r\n    PROF. BROWN D. GREEN, AGENT.\r\n\r\nAgainst the advice of the editor of the Times, I dispatched an agent\r\nover to Sidon, with a supply of blanked bills from the same form, with\r\ninstructions to arrange for a similar 'sell' on the following Monday\r\nevening in that charming village.\r\n\r\nI was sufficiently busy during the interval that lay between this and\r\nSaturday evening in rehearsing my part for the entertainment thus\r\nadvertised. I was not entirely free from doubts of the success of a\r\n'take-in' so palpable and ridiculous, and even if a house-full of\r\nnumbsculls _should_ gather, I deemed the experiment a dangerous one for\r\nme; but my editorial friend took the risk, remarking that he had\r\ncalculated his chances, and knew what he was about. Nevertheless, it\r\nwas not without some trepidation that I entered Grecian Hall by the\r\nprivate door, at a little before seven o'clock, and laid my hat behind\r\nthe temporary curtain that had been erected for the accommodation of the\r\ngreat Humbug Troupe. Applying my eye to a chink in the cloth, I\r\nperceived that the hall was crowded to suffocation. My editorial friend\r\nsat in a prominent position near the stage, and the audience was\r\nmanifesting those signs of impatience which seem to be equally orthodox\r\namong the news-boys in the pit of the old Bowery Theatre and the coarse\r\nyoung rustics who go to 'shows' in the back villages of ruraldom. I\r\ntinkled a bell. The uproar grew quiet. I drew aside my curtain, and made\r\nmy bow, amid the silent wonderment of my auditors. Then I said:--\r\n\r\n'Ladies and gentlemen: You now see before you the redoubtable Fantadimo\r\nFantodimus, master of ceremonies for the Great Humbug Troupe. You also\r\nsee before you, ladies and gentlemen, Mons. Belitz, the renowned\r\nmagician, Mademoiselle Heliotrope, the graceful danseuse, Signor\r\nStrawstekowski, Herr Balamsass; and, in short, ladies and gentlemen, you\r\nsee before you the sum and substance of the Great Humbug Troupe, as it\r\nexists in all its original splendor. We salute you!\r\n\r\n'My friends, you were drawn here to-night by the extravagantly worded\r\nand outlandish representations of a poster which promised you only one\r\nsingle thing, namely, that you should behold a Great Traveling Humbug.\r\nNothing could be more honest, though some things might be more\r\nstraightforward. Force of circumstances compels me this evening to\r\nrepresent the Great Traveling Humbug you came to see. I am this evening\r\nthe greatest of humbugs. I travel. A week ago, I traveled into this\r\nvillage with the laudable intention of giving you a sensible lecture on\r\nEURIPIDES, a historical personage of whom some of you may have heard. I\r\ntraveled over to this hall on the evening of my lecture, and spoke to a\r\nbeggarly array of empty seats. To-morrow morning, I intend to travel to\r\nchurch in your beautiful village, repent of my sins, and on Monday\r\ntravel home to New York, where I shall at once take measures to rid\r\nmyself of the title I wear this evening, by earning my bread in the\r\nold-fashioned way, by the sweat of my brow.\r\n\r\n'Humbug, ladies and gentlemen, is a pill not at all disagreeable to\r\ntake, when gilded carefully. My pill has been prepared by the hand of a\r\nnovice, and you have swallowed it with your eyes open. May it benefit\r\nyou!'\r\n\r\nSymptoms of a disturbance immediately became manifest, when my editorial\r\nangel arose and spread his wings over the troubled audience.\r\n\r\n'People of Tyre,' said he, 'the exhibition of the Great Humbug Troupe\r\nis, in my opinion, one of the most interesting and least objectionable\r\nthat ever appeared in our village. It remains for us to make it\r\ninstructive. I propose that we give three cheers for our brave\r\nentertainer,--hip, hip,\r\n\r\n'_Hurrah!_ HURRAH! HURRAH!'\r\n\r\nLike young thunder the last cheer arose; and my bacon was saved!\r\n\r\nThe receipts placed me in possession of fifty dollars, after defraying\r\nall expenses in Tyre and settling my bill and recovering my satchel from\r\nSidon--which I did by a messenger the same evening after the lecture. My\r\neditorial friend advised me now to stop at Sidon only long enough to\r\ntake the first train home, leaving the Sidonites to discover the sell\r\nwithout expense. But I scouted the idea. I was flushed with the success\r\nof the previous evening (a success mainly due, as the sagacious reader\r\nknows, to the editor of the _Times_ and his _corps_ of confidants\r\ndistributed at intervals over the hall); I was chagrined at the turn my\r\noriginal enterprise had taken, but determined to carry it out 'to the\r\ndeath;' and, more than all, I was burning to revenge myself on the\r\nperfidious postmaster of Sidon, and Dr. Tomson and Squire Johnson and\r\nMr. Dickson and Mr. Dobson and Mr. Potkins. And on Monday evening I\r\nfaced an audience in Jones's Hall, Sidon, prominent among whom I\r\nnoticed, the principal objects of my ire.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--HE DON'T MAKE A HIT IN SIDON, THOUGH SOME PERSON IN THE AUDIENCE\r\nDOES.\r\n\r\nNo time for contemplation was left on my hands, however; for as soon as\r\nI had articulated the words 'ladies and gentlemen,' an offensive missile\r\nhit me between my eyes, exploded, and deluged me with an odor in\r\ncomparison with which that of Limberger cheese would be mere geranium. I\r\nwas betrayed. Tyre had sent over a detachment of spies, and the\r\nSidonites were armed. I briskly dodged several companion eggs whose\r\nfoulness was permitted to adorn the walls of Jones's Hall behind me, and\r\nthen undertook to escape. Simultaneously with the explosion of the first\r\nshot, a howl had burst from the audience, which boded no good for any\r\nprospects of comfort and profit I might entertain. Escaping on my part\r\nbecame no joke; and I beg the reader to believe that my chagrin was\r\nquite overwhelmed in the all-impressive desire to protect myself from\r\ntotal annihilation. In my subsequent gratitude at having accomplished\r\nthis feat, I overlooked the little discomforts of an eye in mourning, a\r\nbroken finger, and garments perfumed throughout in defiance of _la\r\nmode_.\r\n\r\nAt present, I am engaged in a business which I deem far more respectable\r\nand lucrative than lecturing, to wit, explaining the merits and\r\nadvantages of a patent needle-threader to interested crowds on Broadway.\r\nHere my oratorical abilities are advantageously displayed, my audiences\r\nare attentive, and my profits are good.\r\n\r\n[_Exit Brown_]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE WATCHWORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n  'Trust in the Lord, and keep your powder dry!'\r\n    So cried stout OLIVER in the storm, before\r\n    That redder rain on bloody Marston Moor,\r\n  Which whelmed the flower of English chivalry.\r\n  Repeat the watchword when the sullen sky\r\n    Stoops with its weight of terror, while the roar\r\n    Of the far thunder deepens, and no more\r\n  God's gracious sunshine greets the lifted eye!\r\n  Not Faith alone, but Faith with Action armed,\r\n    Shall win the battle, when the anointed host\r\n  Wars with the alien armies, and, unharmed,\r\n    Snatch victory from a field where all seemed lost.\r\n  Front Death and Danger with a level eye;\r\n  Trust in the Lord, _and keep your powder dry!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTINTS AND TONES OF PARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a curious test of national character to compare the prevalent\r\nimpressions of one country in regard to another whereof the natural and\r\nhistorical description is quite diverse: and in the case of France and\r\nEngland, there are so many and so constantly renewed incongruities, that\r\nwe must discriminate between the effect of immediate political jealousy,\r\nin such estimates, and the normal and natural bias of instinct and\r\ntaste. To an American, especially, who may be supposed to occupy a\r\ncomparatively disinterested position between the two, this mutual\r\ncriticism is an endless source of amusement. In conversation, at the\r\ntheatre, on the way from Calais or Dover to either capital, at a Paris\r\n_café_, or a London club-house, he hears these ebullitions of prejudice\r\nand partiality, of self-love or generous appreciation, and finds therein\r\nan endless illustration of national character as well as of human\r\nnature. But perhaps the literature of the two countries most\r\nemphatically displays their respective points of view and tone of\r\nfeeling. While a popular French author sums up the elements of life in\r\nEngland as being _la vie de famille, la politique, et les\r\naffaires_,--'domestic life, politics, and business,'--he complacently\r\ninfers that _le fond du caractère Anglais_, 'the basis of the English\r\ncharacter,' is nothing more nor less than _le manque de bonheur_--'a\r\nwant of anything like happiness.' An English thinker, on the other hand,\r\nfinds in the very language of France the evidence of superficial emotion\r\nand unaspiring, irreverent intelligence. 'How exactly,' writes Julius\r\nHam, 'do _esprit_ and _spirituel_ express what the French deem the\r\nhighest glory of the human mind! A large part of their literature is\r\n_mousseux_; and whatever is so, soon grows flat. Our national quality is\r\nsense, which may, perhaps, betray a tendency to materialism; but which,\r\nat all events, comprehends a greater body of thought, that has settled\r\ndown and become substantiated in maxims.'[A] How far a Frenchman is from\r\nappreciating this distinction, as unfavorable to his own race, we can\r\nrealize from the following estimate of the historical evil which an\r\nadmired modern writer considers that race has suffered from the English,\r\nand from the character of the latter as recognized by another equally a\r\nfavorite:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Guesses at Truth.]\r\n\r\n'Iniquitous England,' writes a popular novelist, 'the vile executioner\r\nof all in which France most exulted, murdered grace in Marie Stuart, as\r\nit did inspiration in Jeanne d'Arc, and genius in Napoleon;'--'a race,'\r\nsays another, 'gifted with a national feeling which well-nigh approaches\r\nsuperstition, yet which has chosen the whole world for its country. The\r\ngravity of _these beings_, accidentally brought together and isolated by\r\nmere interest, their life of mechanical activity, and of labor without\r\nrelaxation as without life, all interest, yet freeze you at the same\r\ntime.' 'The Englishman has made unto himself a language appropriate to\r\nhis placid manners and silent habits. This language is a murmur\r\ninterrupted by subdued hisses,'--'_un murmure entre-coupé de sifflements\r\ndoux_.'\r\n\r\nThe gregarious hotel life in America commends itself to the time-saving\r\nhabits of a busy race; but the love of speciality in France modifies\r\nthis advantage: in our inns a stated price covers all demands except for\r\nwine; here each separate necessity is a specific charge--the sheet of\r\nwriting paper, the cake of soap, and the candle figure among the\r\ninnumerable items of the bill. Thus an infinite subdivision makes all\r\nbusiness tedious, involving so many distinct processes and needless\r\nconditions; at every step we realize of how much less comparative value\r\nis time in the Old World. On the other hand, the rigid system that\r\ngoverns municipal life, the means adopted to render all public\r\ninstitutions both accessible and attractive, claim perpetually the\r\ngratitude of artists, students, and philosophers. A programme of\r\nexploration may be arranged at will, yielding a complete insight, and,\r\nwhen achieved, such has been the order, communicativeness and facility,\r\nthat we have a more distinct and reliable idea of the whole circle of\r\nobservation than it is possible to obtain elsewhere. We are continually\r\nreminded of Buffon's maxim: '_la genie est la patience_.' A curious\r\nillustration of this systematic habit of the French occurred at\r\nConstantinople, during the Crimean war, where they immediately numbered\r\nthe houses and named the streets, to the discomfiture of the passive\r\nTurks--one of whom, in his wonder at the mechanical superiority of these\r\nFrank allies, asked a soldier if the high fur cap on his head would come\r\noff. The _concièrge_ beneath each _porte cochére_, the social\r\ndistinction which makes each _café_ and restaurant the nucleus of a\r\nparticular class, the organized provision for all exigencies of human\r\nlife in Paris, illustrate the same trait on a larger and more useful\r\nscale. If we survey the institutions and the monuments with care, and\r\nrefer to their origin, associations and purposes, the historical and\r\neconomical national facts are revealed with the utmost clearness and\r\nunity. The old Bastile represented, in its gloomy stolidity, the whole\r\ntragedy of the Revolution; and St. Genevieve combines the holy memories\r\nof the early church with that of the first French kings; the site of a\r\n_fosse commune_ attests the valor of republican martyrs; the Champs\r\nElysées are the popular earthly fields of a French paradise. One _café_\r\nis famed for the beauty of its mistress, another for the great\r\nchess-players who make it a resort; one is the daily rendezvous of the\r\nliberals, another of royalists, one of military men, another of artists;\r\nthey flourish and fade with dynasties, and are respectively the\r\nfavorites of provincials and citizens, gourmands and traders, men of\r\nletters and men of state.[A] The _Monte de Piété_ acquaints us with the\r\nvicissitudes and expedients of fortune; the _Hotel Dieu_ is a temple of\r\nancient charity; the _Hospice des Enfants Trouvées_ startles us with the\r\nastounding fact that half the children born in Paris are illegitimate;\r\nand the Morgue yields no less appalling statistics of suicide. In\r\nVernet's studio we feel the predominance of military taste and education\r\nin France; in the _Ecole Polytecnique_, the policy by which her youth\r\nare bred to serve their country; at the manufactories of the Gobelines\r\nand Sévres china, we perceive how naturally the mechanical genius of the\r\nrace finds development in pottery and fabrics instead of ships and\r\nmachines, as across the Channel and beyond the ocean; and in the\r\nself-possession, knowledge of affairs, and variety of occupation of the\r\nmiddle class of women, we see why they have no occasion to advocate\r\ntheir rights and complain of the inequality of the sexes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: 'Mes habitudes de dîner chez les restaurants,' says a\r\nParisian philosopher, 'ont été pour moi une source intarrissable de\r\nsurprises, de decouvertes, et de revelations sur l'humanité.']\r\n\r\nAll large cities furnish daily material for tragedy, and life there,\r\nkeenly observed and aptly narrated, proves continually how much more\r\nstrange is truth than fiction; but the impressive manners and\r\nmelo-dramatic taste of the people, as well as their intricate police\r\nsystem, bring out more vividly these latent points of interest, as a\r\nreference to the _Causes Célébres_ and the Memoirs of Vidocq illustrate.\r\nA friend of mine, returning from a trip to Lyons, became acquainted in\r\nthe rail-car with an English gentleman, and when they reached the\r\nstation, just before midnight, the two left for their hotels in the same\r\ncab. After a short drive, the vehicle suddenly came to a halt, the\r\ncabman sprang to the ground, and his passengers were left to surmise the\r\noccasion of their abrupt abandonment: presently a crowd collected, a\r\nshout was raised, and they learned that a valise had been stolen from\r\nthe top of the carriage, and its owner had set off in pursuit of the\r\nthief. He ran with great swiftness, doubled corners, sprang over\r\nobstacles, and was in a fair way to distance his pursuer, when a\r\nsoldier thrust out his foot and tripped up the fugitive, who was taken\r\nto the nearest police station. Confronted with the owner of the valise,\r\nhe declared it was his own property, placed by mistake on the wrong cab.\r\nThe official authorized to settle the difficulty not being present, my\r\nfriend and his companion were informed they must leave the article in\r\ndispute, and the case itself, until the following morning, when a\r\nhearing would be had before one of the courts. On reaching their\r\ndestination, the gentlemen parted with the understanding that they would\r\ndine together at a certain restaurant the next day. The appointed hour\r\ncame, but not the Englishman; and my friend's appetite and patience were\r\nkeen set, when, after an hour's delay, the truant made his appearance,\r\nlooking pale, _triste_ and exhausted. He soon explained the cause of his\r\ndetention. He had gone to the police court to prove and regain his\r\nvalise, and found at the bar a young man of genteel address and\r\nremarkable beauty; his costume was in the latest fashion, though\r\nsomewhat soiled and torn from his fall and rough handling the previous\r\nnight; but his countenance was intelligent and refined, and his bearing\r\nthat of a gentleman. Upon a table lay the valise and the contents of the\r\nprisoner's pockets, among them a large penknife; he held convulsively to\r\nthe rail and kept his eyes cast down; the judge had taken his seat, and\r\na crowd of idlers and gens d'armes filled the room. The claimant\r\nimmediately satisfied the court that the valise belonged to him by\r\nmentioning several articles it contained and producing the key. In the\r\nmean time the accused, earnestly watching the entrance, started and\r\nturned pale and red by turns as a beautiful girl, in the dress of a\r\nprosperous grisette, pushed her way into the crowd, stood on tiptoe, and\r\nexchanged glances with the prisoner. The latter, when asked his name,\r\nreplied, 'I have brought disgrace enough upon it already,' and, seizing\r\nthe penknife, thrust it into his heart, and fell dead. He was the\r\ndescendant of a noble house in one of the southern provinces, and came\r\nto Paris as a medical student, and, through a devoted attachment to his\r\nmistress, whose costly tastes soon drained his purse, was induced to\r\nsteal the trunks of travelers as they left the railway stations at\r\nnight. In his apartment was found a large wardrobe; and a month's\r\npurloining was thus summarily expiated. Similar incidents occur\r\nelsewhere, but the details, when the scene is laid in Paris, are more\r\npicturesque and dramatic.\r\n\r\nTwo instances which I heard related will illustrate this same dramatic\r\nsignificance in the municipal system. After an _émeute_, the _chef_ of\r\npolice in a certain _arrondissement_, while engaged in superintending\r\nthe removal of corpses from a barricade, noticed the body of a female\r\nwhose delicate hands and finely-wrought robe were so alien to the scene\r\nas to excite suspicion. He ordered it to be placed in a separate\r\napartment for examination. A more careful inspection confirmed his\r\nsurmise that this was the body of no amazonian whose warlike zeal or\r\naccidental presence in such an affray could explain its discovery. There\r\nwas no trace whereby the remains could be identified except a geranium\r\nleaf that was found imbedded in her long and disheveled tresses. This\r\nwas given to a celebrated botanist, with orders to learn, if possible,\r\nfrom what plant it had been taken. The man of science visited all the\r\nhouses of the neighborhood, and critically examined every specimen of\r\nthe shrub he could find. At length, in the elegant library of a young\r\nabbé, he not only discovered one of the species, but, by means of a\r\npowerful microscope, detected the very branch whence the leaf had been\r\nnipped. By dexterous management the _chef_, thus scientifically put on\r\nthe track, brought home the charge to the priest, who confessed the\r\nmurder of the young lady in a fit of jealousy, and, by depositing her\r\nbody, at night, amid the dead of humbler lineage, who had fallen in the\r\nrevolutionary strife, thought to conceal all knowledge of his crime.\r\n\r\nThe lessee of an extensive 'hotel' had reason to believe that a child\r\nhad entered and left the world in one of his tenants' apartments,\r\nwithout the cognizance of a human being except the mother; and, aware,\r\nas a landlord in Paris should be, of his responsibility to the municipal\r\ngovernment, he communicated his suspicions to the authorities. The rooms\r\nwere searched, the charge denied, and no proof elicited to warrant\r\nfurther action; and here the matter would have ended in any other\r\ncountry. But the police agent entrusted with the inquiry raked over the\r\ncontents of a pigsty in the courtyard, and discovered a square inch of\r\nthin bone, which he exhibited to an anatomist, who pronounced it a\r\nfragment of a new-born infant's skull; the hogs were instantly killed,\r\nthe contents of their stomachs examined, and small portions of the body\r\nfound. The question then arose whether the child was born alive; pieces\r\nof the lungs were placed in a basin of water, and the fact that they\r\nfloated on its surface proved, beyond a doubt, that the child had\r\nbreathed; the crime of infanticide was then charged upon the unhappy\r\nmother, who, appalled by this evidence of her guilt, confessed.\r\n\r\nIn the gray of the dawn a watchful observer may behold the two extremes\r\nof Paris life ominously hinted;--a cloaked figure stealthily dropping a\r\nswathed effigy of humanity, just 'sent into this breathing world,' in\r\nthe rotary cradle of the asylum for _enfants trouvés_, and a cart full\r\nof the corpses of the poor, driven into the yard of a hospital for\r\ndissection.\r\n\r\nSummoned one evening at dusk to the sick chamber of a countryman, I\r\nrealized the shadows of life in Paris. From the dazzling Boulevard the\r\ncab soon wound through dim thoroughfares, up a deserted acclivity, to a\r\ngloomy porch. A cold mist was falling, and I heard the bell sound\r\nthrough a vaulted arch with desolate echoes. When the massive door\r\nopened, a lamp suspended from a chain revealed a paved _entresol_ and\r\nbroad staircase; there was something prison-like even in the patrician\r\ndimensions of the edifice; the light nickered at every gust. Ascending,\r\nI pulled a _cordon bleu_, and was admitted into the apartment. It\r\nconsisted of four places or rooms, the furniture of which was in the\r\nneatest French style, both of wood and tapestry; but the fireplace was\r\nnarrow, and so ill-constructed that while the heat ascended the chimney\r\nthe smoke entered the room. A nurse, with one of those keen,\r\nself-possessed faces and that efficient manner so often encountered in\r\nParis, ushered me to the invalid's presence. He was a fair specimen of a\r\nphilosophic bachelor inured to the life of the French metropolis;\r\neverything about him was in good taste, from the model of the lamp to\r\nthe cover of the arm-chair; and yet an indescribable cheerlessness\r\npervaded his elegant lodging. The last play of Scribe, the day's\r\n_Journal des Debats_, a bouquet, and a Bohemian glass, were on the\r\nmarble table at his side. His languid eye brightened and his feverish\r\nhand tightened convulsively over mine; years had elapsed since he left\r\nour native town; he had drunk of the cup of pleasure, and cultivated the\r\nresources of literature and science in this their great centre; but now,\r\nin the hour of physical weakness, the yearning for domestic and home\r\nscenes filled his heart; and his mind reacted from the blandishments of\r\na luxurious materialism and a refined egotism of life. It was like\r\nfalling back upon the normal conditions of existence thus to behold the\r\n'ills that flesh is heir to' in the midst of a city where such rich\r\noutward provision for human activity and enjoyment fills the senses.\r\nExcessive civilization has its morbid tendencies, and great refinement\r\nin one direction is paralleled by an equal degree of savagery in\r\nanother. There is in absolute relation between the facilities for\r\npleasure and the frequency of suicide. Of all places in the world, Paris\r\nis the most desolate to an invalid stranger. The custom of living there\r\nin lodgings isolates the visitor; the occupants of the dwelling are not\r\nalive to the claims of neighborhood; with his landlord he has only a\r\nbusiness and formal connection; thus thrown upon himself, without the\r\nnerve or the spirits for external amusement, few situations are more\r\nforlorn. The Parisian French are intensely calculating and selfish;\r\nillness and grief are so alien to their tastes that, to the best of\r\ntheir ability, they ignore and abjure them. As long as health permits,\r\nout-of-door life or companionship solaces that within; the stranger may\r\nbe enchanted; but when confined to his apartment and dependent on chance\r\nvisitors or hireling services, he longs for a land where domestic life\r\nand household comfort are better cultivated and understood.\r\n\r\nThe stranger's funeral is peculiarly sad everywhere, but in Paris its\r\nmelancholy is enhanced by the interference of foreign usages. Over the\r\ndead as well as the living the municipal authorities claim instant\r\npower, and the bereaved must submit to their time and arrangements in\r\ndepositing the mortal remains of the loved in the grave. The black\r\nscarfs and chapeaux of the undertakers and their prescriptive orders\r\nwere strangely dissonant to the group of Americans collected at the\r\nobsequies of a young countryman, and seemed incongruous when associated\r\nwith the simple Protestant ceremonial performed in another tongue. Under\r\nthe direction of those sable officials we entered the mourning coaches\r\nand followed the plumed hearse. It is an impressive custom--one of the\r\nhumanities of the Catholic--to lift the hat at the sight of such a\r\nprocession; such an act, performed like this by prince and beggar in the\r\ncrowded street, so gay, busy, self-absorbed, bears affecting witness to\r\nthe common vicissitudes and instincts of mankind. The dead leaves\r\nstrewed the avenue of Pere la Chaise, and the bare trees creaked in the\r\ngale as we threaded sarcophagi, tablets, and railed cenotaphs; in the\r\ndistance, smoke-canopied, stretched the vast city; around were countless\r\neffigies of the dead of every rank, from the plain slab of the\r\nundistinguished citizen to the wreathed obelisk of the hero, from the\r\nancient monument of Abelard and Heloise to the broken turf on the new\r\ngrave of poverty only designated by a wooden cross; gray clouds flitted\r\nalong the zenith, and a pale streak of light defined the wide horizon;\r\nParis with its frivolity, temples, business, pleasures, trophies and\r\nteeming life, sent up a confused and low murmur in the distance; only\r\nthe wind was audible among the tombs. Never had the beautiful Church of\r\nEngland services appeared to me so grand and pathetic as when here read\r\nover the coffin of one who had died in exile, and with only a few of his\r\ncountrymen, most of them unacquainted even with his features, to attend\r\nhis burial.\r\n\r\nHowever a change of government may interfere with a Parisian's freedom\r\nof speech and pen, the autocrat is yet to appear who dares place an\r\ninterdict on his culinary aptitudes. The science of dining in Paris has,\r\nnotwithstanding, its new mysteries; and in order to be abreast of the\r\ntimes, it is wise, instead of drawing on past experience, to take\r\ncounsel of a friend who holds the present clue to the labyrinth of bills\r\nof fare and fair bills. The little cabinet of my favorite restaurant,\r\nsacred to the initiated, had the same marble table, cheerful outlook,\r\npictured ceiling and breezy curtains,--the same look of elegant\r\nsnugness; but, when we had seated ourselves in garrulous conclave over\r\nthe _carte_, it was to the member of our party whose knowledge was of\r\nthe latest acquisition that we submitted the choice of a repast; and as\r\nhe discoursed of the mysterious excellences of _cotelletes a la\r\nVictoria, rissoles a la Orleans, patés de fois gras a la Bonaparte,\r\npaupicettes de veau a la Demidoff, truffes a la Perigord_, etc., we\r\nrealized that the same incongruous blending of associations, the same\r\nzest for glory and dramatic instinct, ruled the world of cookery as of\r\nletters, and that, with all the political vicissitudes since our last\r\ndinner in Paris, her prandial distinction had progressed.\r\n\r\nFrom the restaurant to the theatre, is, in Paris, a most natural\r\ntransition; and the play and players of the day will be found far more\r\nclosely representative of the social tone, the political creed, the\r\nartistic tastes of the hour, than elsewhere. The drama, for instance, in\r\nvogue not long since at the Vaudeville Theatre in the Place de la\r\nBourse, is one we can scarcely imagine successful in another city, at\r\nleast to such a degree. It was _Les Filles de Marbre_; and this is the\r\nplot. The opening scene is at Athens, in the studio of Phidias. It is\r\nthe day after that on which Alcibiades cut off his dog's tail; and,\r\nexulting in the effect produced by that exploit, he enters with the rich\r\nGorgias, who has ordered and paid Phidias in advance for statues of his\r\nthree friends, Laïs, Phryné, and Aspasia. He finds Phidias unwilling to\r\npart with the statues, on which he has worked so long and ardently till,\r\nlike Pygmalion of old, he has fallen in love with his own creation; he\r\nwill not even allow Gorgias to see them, and the latter departs swearing\r\nvengeance. Diogenes enters, and a satirical brisk dialogue ensues, at\r\nthe end of which Phidias draws aside a curtain and shows his work to\r\nDiogenes, who, stoic as he is, can not refrain from an exclamation of\r\ndelight. The group is admirably arranged on the stage, and the effect is\r\nvery fine as Theä, a young slave, holds back the drapery from the group\r\nwhile the moon illumines it with a soft light. At this moment an\r\napproaching tumult is heard. Theä drops the curtain, and Gorgias with\r\nhis friends, heated with Cyprus wine, enters, accompanied by the\r\n'myrmidons of the law.' He again demands the statues, for which Phidias\r\nhas already received his gold. Phidias expostulates, then entreats,--no,\r\nGorgias will have his statues. At this, Theä, who had long loved\r\nPhidias, unknown to him, hardly noticed, never requited, throws herself\r\nat Gorgias's feet and cries, 'Take me, sell me; I am young and strong,\r\nbut leave Phidias his statues.' Gorgias says, 'Who are you? Poor\r\ncreature, you are not worth over fifty drachmas! Away! Guards, do your\r\nduty! Slaves, seize the statues.' Then Diogenes, hitherto half asleep on\r\na mat in the corner, cries, 'Stop, Gorgias! You always profess justice,\r\nstrict justice. Why don't you ask with whom of you the statues will\r\nprefer to stay?' A shout of laughter from his jolly companions makes\r\nGorgias accede to this droll proposal. 'So be it!' cries he; and\r\nDiogenes draws aside the curtain, and holds up his lantern, which, with\r\na strong French reflector, throws a powerful light on the upper part of\r\nthe group, with a fine and startling effect. The group represents\r\nAspasia seated, with a scroll and stylus, Laïs leaning over her, and\r\nPhryné at her feet looking up, all draped, artistically _posed_, and the\r\nthree beautiful girls that perform the parts look as like marble as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n'Now, Phidias,' cries Diogenes, 'come, what have you to say to your\r\nmarble girls?'\r\n\r\n'Laïs, Aspasia, Phryné, I am Phidias. You owe me your existence, and I\r\nlove you; you know it, and that I am poor.'\r\n\r\n'That's a bad argument, Phidias,' says Diogenes.\r\n\r\n'I am poor, and have nothing but you. Stay by him to whom you owe your\r\nglory and your immortality!'\r\n\r\nThe statues remain immovable.\r\n\r\nGorgias addresses them: 'I am Gorgias, the rich Athenian; I alone am as\r\nrich as all the kings of Asia, and I offer you a palace paved with gold.\r\nAspasia, Laïs, Phryné, which of us do you choose?'\r\n\r\nThe statues turn their heads and smile faintly on Gorgias, who starts\r\nand stands as if petrified. The Athenians look horror-struck. Phidias\r\ncovers his face with his hands, and, uttering a cry, falls to the\r\nground. A soft and enervating strain of music fills the air.\r\n\r\n'By all the gods!' cries Gorgias, 'I believe the statues moved their\r\nlips as if to smile upon me.'\r\n\r\n'I know you by that smile, O girls of marble,' says\r\nDiogenes,--'courtesans of the past, courtesans of the future!' and he\r\nreturns to his mat.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Theä's voice is heard in the far distance, singing a few\r\nmystical, mournful bars of music, and the curtain falls.\r\n\r\nThis is the 'argument,'--the other four acts work it out.\r\n\r\nThe next act opens in a restaurant of to-day in the Bois de Boulogne,\r\nnear Paris. A young artist lives there, and falls desperately in love\r\nwith an actress, for whom he leaves his art, his mother, and his\r\nbetrothed, is ruined in purse, and returns at last, heart-broken, to\r\nhis old home, to die; the actress all the while sees his despair with\r\nindifference, and proves herself therefore a '_fille de marbre_'\r\n\r\nIn another recent piece, we are told that a 'procession of nuns, dressed\r\nin white, sing a lay at midnight. In the intervals, a chorus of frogs in\r\nthe neighboring swamp croak the refrain in unison. Sax, the great\r\nbrass-founder, who made the Last Trumpets for the 'Wandering Jew,' and\r\nthe instruments for the Band of the Guides, is engaged upon the\r\nfrogpipes required. The illusion will be heightened by characteristic\r\nscenery and mephitic exhalations. M. Sax visited the pool in the Bois de\r\nBoulogne, known as the _Marée d'Auteuil_, and brought back many useful\r\nideas in reference to the quadruped with whose vocal powers he desired\r\nto become acquainted. The frog voices will be a series of eight,\r\nrepresenting a full octave.'\r\n\r\nThe Provincial, at Paris, is a standard theme for playwrights; what the\r\nScotch were to Johnson, Lamb, and Sidney Smith, is the native of\r\nProvence or Brittany to the comic writers of the metropolis,--a nucleus\r\nfor wit and an occasion for practical jokes. One of the late pieces,\r\ncalled 'My Uncle,' turned upon the devices of a wild youth to obtain\r\nmoney from his simple-hearted relative in the country. For months a\r\npretended love affair, a marriage, and the birth of an heir, elicited\r\nremittances, which were expended upon banquets, at which a bevy of gay\r\nstudents applauded the ingenuity of their entertainer. At last the uncle\r\ncomes to town, and it becomes quite a study to carry on the game, which\r\nyields occasion for innumerable salient contrasts between rustic\r\nsimplicity and city acumen. A diagnosis of the provincial's ways in\r\nParis, like every form of life there, has been given by a shrewd\r\nobserver, who mentions among other signs that the novice may be\r\nrecognized by the fact that he keeps his toothpick after dinner and\r\ncarries it to the theatre.\r\n\r\nI found that marvelous actress, Rachel, before her visit to America,\r\nmuch attenuated; indeed, she resembled a bundle of nerves electrified\r\nwith vitality; her bleached skin, thin arms, large, scintillating eyes,\r\nand that indescribable something which marks the Jewish physiognomy,\r\ngave her a weird, sibyl-like appearance, as of one wasted by long\r\nvigils. There was in her glance and action the spasmodic inspiration\r\nobservable in Malibran towards the close of her career. The play was\r\nRacine's Andromache, and the depth and energy of Hermione's emotions\r\nwere illustrated by a sudden transition of tone, a working of the\r\nfeatures, that a painter might study forever, and a gesture, bearing,\r\nlook and utterance which were the consummation of histrionic art; yet so\r\nexclusively was this the ease, that admiration never lost itself in\r\nsympathy; it was the perfection of acting, not of nature; it won and\r\nchained the scrutinizing mind, but failed to sway the heart; it lacked\r\nthe magnetic element; and while the critic was baffled in the attempt to\r\npick a flaw, and the elocutionist in raptures at the sublime\r\npossibilities of his art, it was Rachel, not Hermione, the genius of the\r\nperformer, not the reality of the character, that won the earnest\r\nattention, and woke the constant plaudits. [A] That over-consciousness\r\nwhich belongs to the French nature, so evident in their 'Confessions,'\r\ntheir oratory, their manners, their conversation, and their life, and\r\nwhich is the great reason of their want of persistence and\r\nself-dependence in political affairs, modifies their ideal\r\nrepresentations on the stage as well as in literature. The process\r\ndescribed so philosophically by Coleridge, to lose 'self in an idea\r\ndearer than self,' is the condition of all greatness. It sublimated the\r\nlife of Washington, and made it unique in the annals of nations; it\r\nenabled Shakspeare to incarnate the elements of humanity in dramatic\r\ncreations, and Kean to reproduce them on the stage; it is the grand law\r\nof the highest achievements in statesmanship, in letters, and in art,\r\nwithout which they fall short of wide significance and enduring\r\nvitality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The very description of her enthusiastic admirers suggests\r\nthat such were the original traits and the special character of Rachel.\r\nAt first we are told by the patron who earliest recognized her genius,\r\n'a delirious popularity surrounded the young _tragedienne_, and with her\r\nthe antique tragedy which she had revived.' How different from the\r\noriginal relation of Kemble, Kean, or Siddons to the Shaksperian drama!\r\nThen the manner in which she prepared herself for artistic triumph is\r\nequally suggestive of the artificial and the conventional: 'Elle se\r\ndrape,' we are told, 'avec un art merveilleux; au theatre elle fait\r\npreuve d'études intelligentes de la statuaire antique.' It was in the\r\nexternal form rather than by sympathetic emotion that she wooed the\r\ntragic muse. Véron compares her to Thiers. 'C'est la même netteté de\r\nvues, la même ardeur, les mêmes ruses vigéreuses, la même fecondité\r\nd'expedients, la même tableau phllosophique que ne la comprend ni la\r\nvengeance ni les haines, qui se contente de negocier avec les inimities,\r\nd'apaiser les rancunes et de conquerir toutes les influences, toutes les\r\namitiés qui peuvent devenir utiles.']\r\n\r\nAlthough thus destitute of great central principles, nowhere is human\r\nlife more enriched by minor philosophy; it may be a fate, a routine, a\r\ndrudgery, and an accident in other parts of the world, but in Paris it\r\nis or can easily be made an art. The science of substitution, the law of\r\ncompensation, nowhere more obviously triumphs; taste cheaply gratified\r\natones for limited destinies; manners yield a charm, which, for the\r\ntime, renders us oblivious of age; tact proves as good a resource as\r\nlearning, wit as beauty, cheerfulness as fortune. The _boudoir_, by\r\nmeans of chintz, gauze, and human vivacity, is as prolific of fine talk\r\nand good company as the drawing-room. A bunch of violets or a box of\r\nmignonnette suggests to sensitive imaginations the whole cornucopia of\r\nFlora. Perhaps the eclectic provision for enjoyment in the French\r\ncapital was never more apparent than during the sojourn of the allied\r\narmies there after the battle of Waterloo. It was as good as a play\r\nillustrative of national manners and taste, to note how Russian, German,\r\nCossack, and English, hussar, diplomat, and general, found the dish, the\r\npastime, and the observance each most coveted, when that vast city was\r\nlike a bivouac of the soldiers of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe communicative habit and social tendency of life, under every aspect,\r\nin Paris, often promotes success by making individuals famous,--a\r\nprocess far easier of achievement there than in any other metropolis. A\r\npoor fellow who opened a _café_, and had so little patronage as at the\r\nend of his first quarter to be on the verge of bankruptcy, resorted, one\r\nday, to the expedient of firing a heavily-charged musket in the midst of\r\nhis neat but unfrequented saloon. The report instantly brought half a\r\nscore of policemen, two gens d'armes, and a crowd of idlers, to the\r\nspot; curiosity was on tiptoe to hear of a murder, a suicide, or an\r\ninfernal machine; strange rumors began to spread from the crowd within\r\nto the street; and a long investigation was held on the premises.\r\nMeantime people wanted refreshments, which the hitherto indolent waiters\r\nof the _café_ supplied; the place was found to be quite snug and\r\ntasteful, and the proprietor quite a lion; thenceforth his credit was\r\nestablished in the neighborhood, and a regular set of customers\r\nliberally sustained his enterprise. Dr. Véron informs us that, after\r\nwaiting six weeks for a patient, upon first commencing practice, he had\r\nthe good fortune to stop the bleeding nose of a _concièrge_, in his\r\nvicinity, which had resisted all the usual appliances; the news of his\r\nexploit was soon noised abroad, its merit exaggerated, and he was\r\nastonished to receive six or seven patients a day, attracted by his\r\nsudden reputation. Unfortunately, however, one day an old lady, of much\r\nconsideration in that quartier, requested him to bleed her; she was so\r\nfat that he made two or three unsuccessful attempts to open a vein, when\r\nshe rose indignantly and pronounced him an _imbecile_,--a judgment which\r\nwas so quickly adopted by the gossips, that in less than a week he sank\r\ninto his original obscurity.\r\n\r\nAnother speciality of Parisian life occurred in the person of an old\r\nman, who came hither in youth, and while pursuing his studies received\r\nnews of the loss of his fortune,--a pittance only remained; and so\r\nenamored had he become of the means of study and the monastic freedom\r\nhere possible for the poor dreamer, that, hiring a cheap and obscure\r\nlodging, he remained a voluntary exile, unallured by the attractions of\r\nAmerican enterprise, which soon revived the broken fortunes of his\r\nbrothers. A more benign cosmopolite or meek disciple of learning it\r\nwould be difficult to find; unlike his restless countrymen, he had\r\nacquired the art of living in the present;--the experience of a\r\nlooker-on in Paris was to him more satisfactory than that of a\r\nparticipant in the executive zeal of home.\r\n\r\nSuch instances form a pleasing contrast to the outward gayety we\r\nhabitually associate with Paris. It boasts a world of patient labor.\r\nEmile Souvestre has drawn some faithful and charming pictures of these\r\nscenes, wherein philosophy and cheerfulness illumine the haunts of\r\nmodest toil. In England and America only artists of great merit enjoy\r\nconsideration; but in Paris the pursuit itself insures countenance and\r\nsympathy, which in themselves yield vast encouragement. There are more\r\nodd characters ensconced in the nooks of this capital than anywhere else\r\nin Europe;--men who have become unconsciously metropolitan\r\nfriars--living in celibate dens, haunting libraries and gardens,\r\nsubsisting on a bare competence, and working out some darling theory or\r\nspeculative problem; lonely in the midst of a crowd, and content in\r\ntheir self-imposed round of frugality and investigation.\r\n\r\nI found the dissatisfied spirit of a young artist, whom I had known in\r\nAmerica, here completely soothed; instead of feeling himself overpowered\r\nby the commercial spirit of his own country, one of a neglected\r\nminority, striving in vain to excite interest in a vocation too\r\nprofitless for a community absorbed in trade, politics, and fashion, he\r\nnow experienced the advantage of a recognized class, and the excitement\r\nof a fraternity in art; his life, studies, aims were those of hundreds\r\nas limited in their circumstances and as ideal in their aspirations;\r\ngalleries, studios, lectures, models, criticism, illustrious men, noble\r\nexamples, friendly words and true companionship, made his daily life,\r\nindependent of its achievements, one of self-respect, of growing\r\nknowledge, and assured satisfaction. Without some pursuit thus enlisting\r\nthe higher powers and justifying, as it were, the independent career of\r\na resident, it is astonishing how the crust of selfishness gathers over\r\nthe heart in Paris; the habit of living with an exclusive view to\r\npersonal enjoyment, where the arrangements of life are so favorable,\r\nbecomes at last engrossing; and a soulless machine, with no instincts\r\nbut those of self-gratification, is often the result, especially if no\r\nties of kindred mitigate the hardihood of epicurism.\r\n\r\nWe soon learn to echo Rochefoucauld's words as he entered Mazarin's\r\ncarriage,--'everything happens in France;' and, like Goethe, cast\r\nourselves on the waves of accident with a more than Quixotic\r\npresage,--if not of actual adventure, at least of adventurous\r\nobservation; for it is a realm where Fashion, the capricious tyrant of\r\nmodern civilization, has her birth, where the '_vielle femme remplissait\r\nune mission importante et tutelaire pour tous les âges_;' where the\r\n_raconteur_ exists not less in society than in literature; the elysium\r\nof the scholar, the nucleus of opinion, the arena of pleasure, and the\r\nhead-quarters of experiment, scientific, political, artistic, and\r\nsocial.\r\n\r\nImagine a disciplined mind alive to the lessons of the past and yet with\r\nsympathy for casual impressions, free, intent and reflective,--and Paris\r\nbecomes a museum of the world. Such a visitor wanders about the French\r\ncapital with the zest of a philosopher; he warms at the frequent\r\nspectacle of enjoyable old age, notwithstanding the hecatombs left at\r\nMoscow and Waterloo, Sebastopol and Magenta; he reads on the dome of the\r\nInvalides the names of a hundred battle-fields; muses on the proximity\r\nof the lofty and time-stained Cathedral, and the little book-stall,\r\nwhere poor students linger in the sun; detects a government spy in the\r\nloquacious son of Crispin who acts as porter at his lodgings; pulls the\r\n_cordon bleu_ at a dear author's oaken door on the _quatrième etage_ in\r\na social mood, and recalls Wellington's marquee on the Boulevard\r\nItalien, in the midst of the gay throng; notes the dexterity of a\r\nperipatetic shoeblack at his work; loves to sup in one of the\r\nrestaurants of the Palais Royal, because there Dr. Franklin was\r\nentertained by the Duke of Orleans; remembers, at the church of St.\r\nGenevieve, that Abelard once lectured on its site; and, gazing on the\r\nbeautiful ware in one of the cabinets of the Louvre, muses of the holy\r\npatience of Palissy. By the handsome quays and bridges of the Seine, he\r\ntries to realize that once only an islet covered with mud hovels met the\r\nwanderer's view. He smiles at the abundance of fancy names, some chosen\r\nfor their romantic sound, and others for the renowned associations,\r\nwhich are attached to vocalist, shop, and mouchoir. He separates, in his\r\nthought, the incongruous emblems around him at this moment,--tricolor\r\nand cresent, St. George and the Lilies, 'God save the Queen' and High\r\nMass, banners that have floated over adverse armies since the\r\ncrusades,--amicably folded over the corpse of a French veteran! Nor are\r\ncharacter and manners less suggestive to such an observer; if an\r\nAmerican, he beholds with astonishment, after all he has heard of the\r\nproverbial courtesy of the French, women habitually yield the wall to\r\nmen, and stops with ill-disguised impatience, on returning from an\r\nafternoon's ride, to have his carriage examined at the gate; contrasts\r\nthe degraded state of the lower orders with the general urbanity and\r\nquietness of demeanor and the stern sway of political rule; marks the\r\nlittle crucifix and cup of holy water at the head of the peasant's bed,\r\nand the diamond cross on the lace kerchief of the kneeling empress;\r\nrecognizes the force of character, the self-dependence, the mental\r\nhardihood of the women, the business method displayed in their exercise\r\nof sentiment, and the exquisite mixture in their proceedings of tact,\r\ncalculation, and geniality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE BASIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever at any stage of American history was there such a crisis of ideas\r\nas at present, and never was there such urgent necessity of setting\r\npromptly, vigorously and clearly before the people the great and new\r\nprinciples which this crisis is bringing to life. So vast are the issues\r\ninvolved, so tremendous their inevitable consequences, that we acquit of\r\nexaggeration the statesman who, in comparing even the gradual unfolding\r\nof the mighty past with this our present, exclaimed, 'Now is the first\r\nof the world's progress.'[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Hon. Daniel S. Dickinson.]\r\n\r\nThe reader is doubtless perfectly familiar with the fact that in the\r\nbattle between the North and the South two opposite principles are\r\ninvolved,--the same which have been at the bottom of all wars for\r\nfreedom, from the beginning of time. The one party believes that one\r\nportion of society must flourish at the expense of another part, of a\r\npermanently sunken class; while the other holds that history proves that\r\nthe lot of all persons in a commonwealth is capable of being gradually\r\nameliorated, and that in any case it is our sacred duty to legislate for\r\nthe poor, on this basis, by allowing them equal rights, and making every\r\nexertion to extend the best blessings of education to them, and open to\r\nevery man, without distinction, every avenue of employment for which he\r\nis qualified.\r\n\r\nThe Northern party, or that of equal rights and free labor, like their\r\npredecessors, hold many ideas which coming years will see realized,\r\nfor--as has always been the case in these contests--science and learning\r\nare always on the liberal side. By a strange accident, for the first\r\ntime almost in history, the Republican party is for once in its\r\nconstituted rights, on its own ground, while the feudal or conservative\r\nwing form the aggressors. As of old, too, the Southern conservatives are\r\nenforcing theories once the property of their foes, who have now\r\nadvanced to broader, nobler, and more gloriously liberal views.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the men of the South believe that labor and capital are\r\nstill antagonisms. Now it is true enough that they _once_ were, and that\r\nwhen the _people_ in different ages first began to rebel against their\r\nhereditary tyrants, the workman was only a serf to his capitalist\r\nemployer. That was the age when demagogues flourished by setting 'the\r\npoor' against 'the rich.' A painful, sickening series of wars it was,\r\nending too often by labor's killing itself with its adversary. Then, a\r\nfoul, false 'democracy' was evolved, which was virtually a rank\r\naristocracy, not of nobility, but of those who could wheedle the poor\r\ninto supporting them. Such was the history of nearly all 'radicalism'\r\nand 'democracy' from the days of Cleon and Alcibiades down to the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nBut the enormous developments of science and of industry have of late\r\nyears opened newer and broader views to the world. As capital has\r\nprogressed in its action it is seen that at every step labor is\r\nbecoming--slowly, but surely, as Heaven's law--identified with it. The\r\nharmony of interests is now no longer a vague Fourieristic notion,--for\r\nnothing is plainer than that the more the operative becomes interested\r\nin the success of the enterprise which employs him, the better is it for\r\nhim and it. And all _work_ in it--the owner and the employee. But then,\r\nwe are told that 'the owner gets the profits.' Does he? Sum up the\r\ncompanies and capitalists who have failed during the past\r\ndecade,--compare what they have lost with what they have paid their\r\nworkmen, and then see who have really pocketed the money, and whether on\r\nthe whole the capitalists have been more than properly repaid for their\r\nrisks, and wear and tear of _brains_. To be sure we are as yet far from\r\nhaving realized a regularly arranged harmony of interests. But I see\r\nthat here, even in this New England, there is nothing which the great\r\nand most intelligent capitalists desire more than this harmony, or a\r\nsystem in which every man's brains and labor shall be properly and\r\nabundantly remunerated, since they see (as all must see who reflect)\r\nthat the nearer we approach such practical adjustment of forces, the\r\nless liable will they be to fail. And the world, as it has reflected\r\nthat labor has flourished among barren rocks, covering them with smiling\r\nvillages, under the fostering care of capital, when fertile Southern\r\nlands are a wilderness for want of this harmony between it and capital,\r\nhas concluded that the old battle between rich and poor was a folly. The\r\nobscure hamlets of New England, which have within thirty years become\r\nbeautiful towns, with lyceums, libraries, and schools, are the most\r\nstriking examples on earth of the arrant folly of this gabble of\r\n'capital as opposed to labor.' In the South, however, the old theory is\r\nheld as firmly as in the days when John Randolph prophesied Northern\r\ninsurrections of starving factory-slaves against manufacturing lords,\r\nand--as President Lincoln recently intimated in his Message--the effort\r\nis there being made to formally enslave labor to capital. That is to\r\nsay, the South not only adheres to the obsolete theory that labor is a\r\nfoe to capital, but proposes to subdue it to the latter. The progress of\r\nfree labor in the North is, however, a constantly increasing proof that\r\nlabor _is_ capital.\r\n\r\nLet the reader carefully digest this statement, and regard it not as an\r\nabstraction of political economy, but as setting forth a vital truth\r\nintimately allied to our closest interests, and to a future involving\r\nthe most serious emergencies. We are at a crisis which demands a new\r\ninflux of political thought and new principles. Our Revolution, with its\r\nConstitution, was such an epoch; so too was the old strife between\r\nFederalism and Democracy, in which both sides contended for what were\r\ntheir rights. Since those days we have gone further, and the present\r\nstruggle, precipitated by the madness and folly of the South, sees\r\nthose who understand the great and glorious question of free labor with\r\nits affinities to capital, endeavoring to prepare the way for a grand\r\ncoming North American Union, in which poor and rich hand in hand shall\r\npress on, extending civilization, and crushing to the ground all\r\nobsolete demagogueism, corruption, and folly.\r\n\r\nIt is time that the word 'radical' were expunged from our political\r\ndictionary. Under the old system of warfare men were regarded as being\r\ndivided into the 'poor,' who were 'out' of capital, and the rich, who\r\nwere 'in.' The progress of good, honest, unflinching _labor_ is causing\r\nmen to look higher than these old limitations. We want no 'outs' or\r\n'ins'--in this country every man should be 'in,' given heart and soul to\r\nhonest industry. And no man or woman who can _work_ is without capital,\r\nfor every such person is a capital in self. When politics are devoted,\r\nas they must be, to extending education and protecting industry, we\r\nshall hear no more of these absurd quarrels between the 'conservative'\r\nand 'radical' elements.\r\n\r\nWhen the government shall have triumphed in this great struggle,--when\r\nthe South, with its obsolete theories of the supremacy of capital over\r\nlabor, shall have yielded to the great advancing truth of the age,--when\r\nfree labor, rendered freer and nobler than ever, shall rule all powerful\r\nfrom ocean to ocean, then we shall see this great American republic\r\nrestored to its original strength and beauty, progressing in the path\r\nlaid down by our Revolutionary forefathers, and stripped of the cruel\r\nimpediments which have clogged its course for years, proving to the\r\nworld the great assertion of all time, that man is capable of\r\nself-government. It is this which lies before us,--neither a gloomy\r\n'conservative' prospect of old-fashioned unchangeability, and still less\r\nthe gorgeous but preposterous dreams of Fourierite or other socialist;\r\nbut simply the healthy future of a hard-working country, in which every\r\nimpediment shall be removed from free labor and its every right\r\nrespected. And to bring this to pass there is but one first step\r\nrequired. Push on the war, support the Administration, triumph at any\r\nrisk or cost, and then make of this America one great free land.\r\nFreedom! _In hoc signo vinces_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK FLAG.\r\n\r\n  You wish that slavers once again\r\n    May freely darken every sea,\r\n  Nor think that honor takes a stain\r\n    From what the world calls piracy;\r\n  And now your press in thunder tones\r\n    Calls for the Black Flag in each street--\r\n  O, add to it a skull and bones,\r\n    And let the banner be complete.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ACTRESS WIFE.\r\n\r\n[CONCLUDED.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments he arose, and, staggering towards me, grasped my\r\nhand and shook it violently, stuttering out, 'Evelyn Afton is an\r\nangel--that is, your wife, I mean, would have made a greater actress\r\nthan Mrs. Siddons. Sefton's a rascal--d----d rascal. You see, Mr. Bell,\r\nI'm not what I was once. The cursed liquor--that's what made me this.\r\nJohn Foster once held his head as high as anybody. Want, sir, absolute\r\nwant, brought me from my \"high estate\"--_id est_, liquor. Cursed liquor\r\nmade me poor, and poverty made me mean.' He continued for some time in a\r\nbroken strain, interrupted by hiccoughs and sobs, exhibiting in his\r\ndemeanor the remains of former brilliancy, but now everything\r\nimpaired--voice, manner, eyesight and intellect--by excessive\r\nindulgence.\r\n\r\nThe result of my conference was learning that Foster had been the agent\r\nof Sefton in a conspiracy against my wife. Foster had of late years made\r\na precarious livelihood by occasional engagement on the stages, and a\r\nfew weeks since had strayed to this city. Being well known to Sefton,\r\nthe latter had promised him ample provision if he would feign illness,\r\ninduce my wife to visit him from motives of charity, and subsequently,\r\nwhen called upon for testimony, allege that her visits were the renewal\r\nof an old licentious intimacy. To these disgraceful propositions\r\nFoster's degradation acceded, though in his better moments he contemned\r\nhis employer and himself.\r\n\r\n'What,' I meditated, 'can be Sefton's design? Can it be to compel my\r\nwife to his passion through threats of destroying her reputation?' I\r\nsmiled as I thought of the futility of such a scheme, for Evelyn would\r\ntreat with the most scornful defiance any attempt at coercion, although\r\nresistance would sacrifice not only her honor but her life. But this can\r\nnot be his real object, else why would he have advised a divorce? I have\r\nit. He is really infatuated with her, and desires to free her from my\r\npossession that she may come into his--knowing his ability to clear her\r\ncharacter, should it appear contaminated, but reckoning chiefly on its\r\npreservation by my own delicacy from any public stain.\r\n\r\nFoster informed me that he always made Sefton aware of my wife's\r\nvisits,--as she appointed the evenings for them,--and that Sefton\r\nattended the interviews, concealed in the next room. I therefore\r\narranged with Foster to inform Sefton that she would be present the next\r\nevening, and then took my leave, Foster repeating again and again,\r\n'Sefton's a rascal--Mrs. Bell's an angel. Only want, absolute want, made\r\nme undertake this. Yes, sir,--I assure you,--_want_.'\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the arrangement, I visited Foster the next evening,\r\narriving before Sefton, and going into the next apartment. Sefton soon\r\nafter entered and engaged in a conversation with Foster, which fully\r\ncorroborated the information I had previously obtained. During its\r\nprogress I entered upon them. Sefton was amazed, and struck with a\r\nconsciousness of discovered guilt.\r\n\r\n'I am now fully aware,' I said, 'Mr. Sefton, of your cause for interest\r\nin my affairs, and of the manner in which you have evinced it'\r\n\r\nHe had by a violent effort recovered his equanimity, and\r\nsaid,--'Prevarication or denial I suppose to be useless. You have\r\nprobably outbid me for the confidence of this miserable villain. What do\r\nyou propose to do?'\r\n\r\n'Were we both young,' I replied, 'there would be only one answer to that\r\nquestion. It would be necessary to have recourse to a duel. As it is, I\r\nam too old a man to be indulged leniently by the public in such a\r\nproceeding. Moreover, I am conscientiously averse to initiating it.\r\nBesides, it will not be permissible in this case to drag my wife's name\r\ninto any publicity. My only alternative, therefore, is to remain content\r\nwith the private discovery of your rascality, and hereafter to forbid\r\nyou any association with what pertains to me or my affairs.'\r\n\r\n'I will obviate all your objections,' he replied. 'I will assume the\r\ninitiative, and attribute your acceptance of a challenge to such causes\r\nas will excuse you to the public. Some story may easily be devised which\r\nwill cover the real motives for our proceeding.'\r\n\r\n'_Now_,' I meditated, 'I have the clue to the mystery. Relying properly\r\non my wife's pride, and (alas!) her probable want of regard for me, this\r\nman was convinced that she would not relate his attempt upon her, and\r\nthat I should never therefore be able to trace his connection with the\r\nconspiracy. My opportune knowledge has counteracted his designs.\r\nEvidently he has determined to possess Evelyn in marriage, since he can\r\nin no other way. Therefore he suggested the divorce; and now, being an\r\nexcellent shot (while unaware of my own skill), he counts on removing me\r\nby death--thus destroying all proof of his villany, and at the same time\r\nall obstacles in his path to her. Well, I am not called on to meet him,\r\nbut I will take this hazard, as well as every other, for her.'\r\n\r\nI signified my assent to his proposals, and there, on the scene of his\r\ndetected iniquity, we calmly discussed the necessary arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe next day, in pursuance of them, we met as by accident in the most\r\nfrequented hotel, and, after the usual salutations, engaged in\r\nconversation, handling various papers, as if transacting a negotiation\r\nof some kind. Gradually we warmed and our tones became louder, until\r\nfinally he exclaimed, 'It is false, Mr. Bell! Entirely false! I never\r\nmade any such representation.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps,' I answered mildly, 'you mean to intimate that I am mistaken,\r\nand would not charge me, as your words imply, with wilful falsehood.'\r\n\r\n'You must make your own application, sir,' he rejoined. 'I say your\r\nstatement is false--so false that a mere mistake can scarcely be\r\nconsidered responsible for it.'\r\n\r\n'Such a reiteration of your insult,' I said, 'leaves me no redress\r\nexcept by force. As you gave the first offense, I return it to your\r\nkeeping.' So saying, I struck him.\r\n\r\nBy-standers, who had been attracted around, now seized us, and there\r\nwas, of course, much excitement and confusion.\r\n\r\n'This is a simple matter of private business, gentlemen,' said Mr.\r\nSefton, 'and its settlement will take place elsewhere.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, gentlemen,' I added, 'your interference now is not required, and\r\nhereafter will be of no avail.' So we separated.\r\n\r\nI proceeded to my place of business and retired to my secret chamber,\r\ngiving orders to admit no one to me (lest I should be disturbed by the\r\nofficiousness of friends seeking to 'arrange' matters), but to send up\r\nany letters. Soon a formal challenge arrived, to which I despatched a\r\nformal answer. At the hour of closing business I sought my chief clerk,\r\nwhom I knew to be a sporting man, and briefly informed him of the\r\nanticipated duel, which was appointed for an early hour the next\r\nmorning, the weapons pistols, and the place a short distance from the\r\ncity, and engaged him to act as my second.\r\n\r\nI occupied the evening in the necessary preparations of my affairs for\r\nthe contingency of a fatal issue. Near midnight I went to my residence,\r\nand in the seclusion of my sleeping chamber passed an hour in a\r\ntumultuous variety of thought. I had briefly written, for Evelyn's\r\nperusal, a history of my life as connected with her, and a true version\r\nof the circumstances leading to the duel. 'If I fall'--I sadly\r\nthought--'will she appreciate my self-offering? Shall I leave her a\r\nlegacy of sorrow, if my death under these circumstances would grieve\r\nher? No! I will die as I have thus far lived--making no expression of\r\nthe love which sways my soul.' I tore my letter into fragments and\r\nburned them. Passing silently into her chamber,--the first time I had\r\nentered it for long months,--I kneeled at her bedside and sobbed. By the\r\ndim light I could trace the marks of grief--cold, heart-consuming\r\ngrief--on her beautiful features--marks which in the day-time resolute\r\npride effaced; as the furrows in the rocks of the sea-shore are seen at\r\nebb-tide, but are concealed when the waters bound at their flood. Slowly\r\nand cautiously I approached my lips to hers, and lightly touched them.\r\nShe stirred, and I sank to the floor. Her sleep being but lightly\r\ndisturbed, I glided like a ghost from the chamber, and with a\r\nheart-rending groan threw myself on my bed and forced forgetfulness and\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nAll parties were on the field at the appointed hour, and the\r\npreliminaries were quickly arranged. There was in Sefton's countenance\r\nthe expression of deliberate criminality, encouraged by the expectation\r\nof an easy triumph. Immediately upon the word, he fired. The ball grazed\r\nmy breast, tore from my shirt-front a pin, and, glancing off, fell into\r\na creek which partly encircled the ground. Had he been a moment less\r\nprecipitate in his determination to ensure my death, the slight movement\r\nI would have made in raising my arm to fire would probably have changed\r\nmy position sufficiently to have received the bullet. My shot followed\r\nimmediately upon his. He was seen to stagger, but declared himself\r\nunhurt, and demanded a second shot. The pistols were prepared and\r\ndelivered. I noticed that Sefton received his with the left hand. We\r\nwere again placed, and just as the word were being given, he fell to the\r\nground. On examination it appeared that at the first fire my ball had\r\nstruck immediately in front of the arm and shattered the clavicle,\r\nthence passing--in one of the freaks peculiar to bullets--immediately\r\nbeneath the flesh, half round the body, lodging under the opposite\r\nshoulder. He had fainted from the wound.\r\n\r\nOf course the duel was ended. Sefton was confined to his house for\r\nweeks, and on recovering removed to Texas, where in a few months\r\nafterward he died from _mania a potu_.\r\n\r\nOn returning home, I found that the tidings of my difficulty with\r\nSefton, and its anticipated consequences, had been communicated to my\r\nwife. She met me in the hall, her eyes flashing, but her manner evincing\r\nmore tenderness than I had ever before witnessed in it. 'Is this true,\r\nMr. Bell,' she asked, 'that public rumor has informed me? Have you had a\r\nquarrel with Mr. Sefton? Have you fought with him?'\r\n\r\n'It is true, my dear,' I replied. 'I have just returned from a duel.'\r\n\r\n'Are you injured? Tell me,' she exclaimed, passionately.\r\n\r\n'Not in the least,' I replied, 'but desperately--hungry.'\r\n\r\n'And he?'\r\n\r\n'I believe he is quite severely wounded. He was carried from the field\r\ninsensible.'\r\n\r\n'Thank God,' she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nI knew it was on her lips to tell me that I had been drawn into a\r\nconflict by a villain, who had met his just deserts, but I forestalled\r\nall explanations by demanding my breakfast, and after her first emotions\r\nhad subsided, merely gave her a matter-of-fact account of our pretended\r\nquarrel, and of the duel.\r\n\r\nBut I laid up in my heart, as a sweet episode in my desolate life, the\r\nanxiety she had manifested for my safety.\r\n\r\nPublic conversation and the newspapers were for a time employed on the\r\nduel, but fortunately the truth was not suggested in the remotest\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nI provided liberally for Foster, and sent him from the city. Where he\r\nnow is I know not. He had informed Evelyn, by a letter, that, his health\r\nhaving improved, he designed to remove.\r\n\r\nI had long since learned Frank's early history, and, through persons to\r\nwhose patronage I had commended him and who had visited his studio at\r\nFlorence, was well acquainted with all his proceedings. My charity\r\ntowards him was producing ample fruits.\r\n\r\nA few months after the duel, Evelyn and I were making a tour in Europe.\r\n\r\nAt a comparatively early hour on the morning after our arrival in\r\nFlorence, we proceeded, without previous announcement, to visit Frank's\r\nstudio. Being ushered into an antechamber of the rather luxurious range\r\nof apartments, which, as I was aware, he occupied, in company with\r\nseveral other bachelors, I merely sent him word that a gentleman and\r\nlady had called to see his works, the servant informing us that he was\r\nat breakfast. Of this our own ears received a sufficient evidence, for,\r\nfrom an adjacent apartment, we heard not only the rattle of table\r\nservice in industrious requisition, but conversation and laughter, which\r\nproved that the bachelors were jolly over their meal. Indeed, their\r\nmutual rallying was not altogether of the most delicate kind, and\r\nseveral favorite signoritas were allude to with various degrees of\r\ninsinuation. In all this, Frank, whose voice I could well distinguish\r\n(its echoes had never left my ear), and which I was satisfied, from\r\nEvelyn's peculiar expression, that she also recognized, bore a prominent\r\npart. Evelyn was astonished. Frank soon appeared, looking the least like\r\nthe imaginative and love-vitalized artist possible, and entirely like\r\nthe gay young dog I knew he had become. The confused character of\r\n_their_ greetings may be conceived. But of this I professed to be\r\nentirely uncognizant, and, after a hasty visit to the studio, gave Frank\r\nan invitation to dinner on the succeeding day, and we departed.\r\n\r\nThe money with which I had liberally supplied Frank had induced him to\r\nenter with a youthful zest into the pleasures of life, and his dream of\r\nlove for Evelyn had attenuated into a mere memory. He was now a\r\nsuccessful and courted artist. I was possessed of another fact in\r\nreference to him--that he was very much domesticated in an American\r\nfamily residing in the city, one of whose young lady members was greatly\r\ndisposed, much to Frank's satisfaction, to recompense to him whatever\r\nsubtractions from his fund of love had previously been wasted on Evelyn.\r\nAccess to this family had been secured to Frank on my recommendation,\r\ngiven before they left America. I conveyed Evelyn to their residence,\r\nand, after also inviting them to our proposed dinner, we returned to our\r\ntemporary home.\r\n\r\nI was careful not to intrude on Evelyn during the evening, leaving her\r\nalone to struggle with the melancholy which I knew the incidents of the\r\nday must induce.\r\n\r\nFrank arrived early the next day. Evelyn's presence had evidently\r\nrenewed the power of his former feelings. Indeed, had opportunity\r\noffered, he was prepared to give way to them, but I was careful that\r\nnone should be afforded. When our other guests arrived he was thrown\r\ninto unexpected confusion. The conflict between the past and the present\r\nlove--the ideal and the real--the shadow and the substance--the memory\r\nand the actual--was painful, yet ridiculous to look upon. I calmly\r\nwatched, without giving any symptom of observation, the results of my\r\nstrategy, and never did a chess-player more rejoice over the issue of a\r\nhard-fought contest. Evelyn, as I perceived, soon discovered all the\r\ncircumstances, and I could trace the conflict of passions in her\r\nbosom--the revulsion at Frank's infidelity, yet the spontaneous\r\nacknowledgment of her heart that he had acted wisely. She was also\r\nreflecting, I was confident, on the weakness that constrained him to\r\nabandon the worship of her image,--however vain and unsatisfactory it\r\nmight be,--and to elevate on the altar of his affections such a goddess\r\nas supplied her place. For the young female in whose service Frank was\r\nenrolled was a plump, merry and matter-of-fact girl, destitute of\r\ngenius, though possessing all the qualities which adapt woman to fulfill\r\nthe duties of the domestic relations.\r\n\r\nMy time for a final demonstration had now arrived. In the despair of her\r\nabandonment, Evelyn must, either welcome me as her deliverer, or she\r\nmust perish in her pride. Death alone could sever us--death alone\r\nfurnished me a remedy for the deprivation of her love.\r\n\r\nIn one of the large, gloomy apartments of the dilapidated palace we\r\noccupied, I sat alone as the twilight was gathering. My pistol case was\r\non the table at my side. I rang the bell, and directed the servant who\r\nanswered it to desire Evelyn's presence, and bring lights. She soon\r\nappeared--cold, passive, incurious, yet beneath this I could see the\r\nconfined struggle of passion.\r\n\r\nI remarked on her looks as peculiar, and expressed a fear that she was\r\nunwell. No, she assured me, her health was as usual. Perhaps, then, she\r\ndid not find her stay in Florence agreeable. Perfectly so. She had no\r\ndesire to go or to remain, except as I had arranged in the programme of\r\nour tour. But, I urged, she seemed dejected. Something must have\r\noccurred to depress her mind. Not at all. She was unaware that her humor\r\nwas different from ordinary.\r\n\r\n'Indeed, Evelyn,' said I, 'there is deception in this, and I insist on\r\nan explanation.'\r\n\r\nShe looked surprised, but did not yet comprehend my purport; so\r\nanswered, in a proper, wife-like manner, that my anxiety had deceived\r\nme--that in all respects her feelings, and, so far as she knew, her\r\nappearance, differed not from what they had been.\r\n\r\n'Well, then,' said I, 'your feelings and appearance must be changed. I\r\nwill tolerate them no longer.'\r\n\r\nHer features evinced the greatest astonishment. 'You are inexplicable,'\r\nshe said. 'May I beg to know your meaning?'\r\n\r\n'Know it? You shall, and you shall conform yourself to it. Resistance\r\nwill be vain, for (displaying the pistols) I have the means of\r\ncoercion.'\r\n\r\nShe thought I was mad, and rose on the impulse to summon help.\r\n\r\n'Do not stir a step,' I said, aiming a pistol at her, 'or it will be\r\nyour last.' She stopped, without exhibiting the least symptom of fear,\r\nbut simply because she saw that to proceed would be useless.\r\n\r\n'Ha! ha! Evelyn,' said I, forcing an imitation of incoherent laughter,\r\n'I am but trifling with you. I am not mad. I sought but to rouse some\r\npassion in you--either of fear or of anger. But, alas! I have not\r\nsufficient power over you even for that. Sit down. I have something to\r\nrelate. When I have ended, these pistols may be useful for one or both\r\nof us. But you do not fear them. I have long known that life was too\r\nvalueless to you for fear of losing it to make any impression.'\r\n\r\nShe saw that something unusual was impending--what she did not fully\r\nunderstand, but calmly took her seat to await it. At this moment a\r\nservant knocked and entered with a letter. I mechanically opened it and\r\nread. It was an announcement from my partners that my inattention to the\r\nbusiness had involved us all in ruin. The clerk to whom I had entrusted\r\nit (the sporting character before mentioned) had defaulted and fled. He\r\nhad contracted large debts in the name of the firm, and gambled away all\r\nthe accessible funds. The ruin was supposed to be irretrievable, and\r\nwith many bitter reproaches I was summoned to return with speed to\r\nextricate affairs, and--make such reparation as I could.\r\n\r\nThe letter filled me with almost demoniacal joy. I was ruined, and for\r\nher sake. I gloated over the thought.\r\n\r\n'These weapons will now be useless,' said I. 'Place them on the shelf\r\nbeside you. This letter will answer in their stead.'\r\n\r\nShe obeyed me, and I then related the information I had received. 'This\r\nruin comes upon me through you.' She thought I was about to make a\r\nvulgar complaint of extravagance, and for once flushed with anger.\r\n'Remain entirely quiet,' I said. 'Hear me, but do not interrupt by word\r\nor gesture. You do not yet understand me.'\r\n\r\nThen I entered on all the particulars of my life; recounted my passion\r\nfor her; told how in my mad infatuation I had bargained for her; how in\r\nmy selfish exultation I had assumed all the freedoms of love, never\r\nstopping to question my right to exercise them; how I was aroused from\r\nmy stupid content by accidentally witnessing her interview with Frank. I\r\nrelated the feelings this excited within me; how for the first time I\r\nlearned the miserable and contemptible part I had acted; how I then\r\nunderstood the sorrow of her life; how I would have crushed out my love\r\nand given her to Frank, had there been any practicable way; how, knowing\r\nthat the only chance for happiness to both was in mutual love, I had\r\ndetermined to gain hers by every act of devotion; how I sought to give\r\nher the only relation to Frank she could properly bear--his\r\nbenefactress. I told her of my secret studies, designed to fit me for\r\ncompanionship with her; of my withdrawing with her into the wilderness,\r\nthat her grief might be alleviated in the inspiring presence of\r\nuncontaminated nature; of my expenditures to gratify her wishes and\r\ntastes. I narrated the incidents which preceded the duel, and informed\r\nher that I was perfectly acquainted with Sefton's object in seeking an\r\nencounter with me; that I gratified him because willing to undertake\r\nevery hazard for her sake. Finally, I avowed my knowledge of all the\r\ndisappointment her heart had experienced by Frank's inconstancy.' know\r\nyou feel, to-night,' I said, 'that existence is an imposture--worse than\r\nthe meanest jiggle. So do I. The only thing that can render it a reality\r\nis love. I intended to say to you, let us end it. For two years, I have\r\nborne the mask of a hypocrite that I might thus tell you of my idolatry,\r\nand say give me love or die. This letter necessitates a change of\r\npurpose. I welcome it as announcing that my sacrifice is\r\ncomplete--inadequate in comparison with the one you made in uniting\r\nyourself to me, but all that I have to give. It is requisite that I must\r\nyet live to do others justice--to provide for our children; although\r\nthey have been valueless to me since I knew that their souls were not\r\nlinks between ours. But you I release. Before dawn I shall be on my\r\nreturn. The provision for your future, thank heaven, no demands of\r\njustice can infringe. Hereafter know me not as your husband, but as one\r\nwho wronged you, devoted his all to reparation, and failed.'\r\n\r\nI rose--weak and tottering--and passed to the door. I caught but a\r\nglimpse of her face. There was in it, and particularly in her\r\neyes,--which, perhaps, on account of her dramatic cultivation, had the\r\nfaculty of concentrating in a wonderful manner the most powerful as well\r\nas the most indefinable expressions,--a peculiar light, which then I did\r\nnot understand, but afterwards, oh, too well. Fool, fool, that I was,\r\nafter all my anxious scrutiny of her moods through two years of\r\nintensest agony, not to understand this one. The alchemist, who wasted\r\nhis life in vigils over his crucible, but stood uncognizant of the gold\r\nwhen it gleamed lustrously before him, was not more a dolt. Thrice\r\nafterward I beheld that light in her glorious eyes. To my spiritual\r\nsight I can ever recall it. When you asked me her history, those orbs of\r\nbeauty beamed out upon me with that same fascinating light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI went immediately to America. My ruin was entire. I had greatly\r\nembarrassed my fortune in wild extravagances for Evelyn, and the\r\nremainder I surrendered to my partners. Their criminations were somewhat\r\nassuaged, and our partnership relations being dissolved, the business\r\nwas reorganized, and I was engaged in a humble clerical capacity. Moody\r\nand taciturn, I was regarded simply as the ordinary victim of a\r\nrecklessly spendthrift wife, and was ridiculed and pitied as such. What\r\ncared I for ridicule or pity?\r\n\r\nA letter came from Evelyn, stating that she designed resuming her\r\nprofession, and would appear immediately in London. Sometime in the\r\nSpring I should hear from her again.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the letter was a formal legal surrender of such property as\r\nshe possessed by my gift or otherwise, and a demand that I should apply\r\nit to cancel my obligations. She would hereafter, she said, provide for\r\nherself. Except a small reservation for the benefit of the children, I\r\ncomplied with her direction. No mandate of hers would I disobey.\r\n\r\nSo existence dragged on. I resided in a humble dwelling with my two\r\nchildren. Their presence did not soothe me,--their infantile affection\r\nmade no appeal to my heart,--but their dependence claimed my\r\ncare.--Memories of Evelyn alone possessed me. I secured full files of\r\nLondon papers, and watched for notices of her appearance. At last they\r\ncame. A new star, the papers said, had suddenly appeared, unheralded, in\r\nthe theatrical firmament, and rapidly culminated in the zenith. She was\r\nunderstood to be an American lady, formerly an actress, who had returned\r\nto the stage on account of domestic difficulties. Some papers intimated\r\nthat her husband was a brute, who had forsaken her; others, that by a\r\nseries of mischances she had been compelled to the stage to support a\r\nhusband and numerous dependent relations. Lengthy criticisms on her\r\nvarious performances were inserted, most of them stuffed with the\r\npseudo-taste and finical ostentation of knowledge prevalent in that\r\ndepartment of newspaper literature, but all according her the most\r\nexalted merit. The tragedies involving the intense domestic affections\r\nwere those she had selected for her _rôles_. Romeo and Juliet, Evadne,\r\nDouglas, Venice Preserved, and others of that class, were mentioned. The\r\ncritics, however, devoted their most enthusiastic encomiums to her\r\nperformance of Imogen in Shakspeare's Cymbeline, a version of which, it\r\nseems, she had herself adapted. The reproduction of this piece, which\r\nhad vanished from the modern _repertoire_, attracted marked attention.\r\nHer rendering of 'Imogen'--was pronounced superb.\r\n\r\nThe papers also made passing allusions to her personal beauty. Soon\r\nparagraphs appeared concerning the attentions of Lord A---- and the Earl\r\nof B---- to her; of the infatuation of certain members of the various\r\ndiplomatic corps. Young men of fashion were reported as throwing to her\r\nbouquets containing diamonds; others sent horses and carriages to her\r\nresidence, with requests for her acceptance. One paper alluded\r\nmaliciously to the fact that a certain antiquated nobleman had given her\r\na New Year's present of _bon bons_, every 'sugared particle' being\r\nfolded in a five-pound Bank of England note. The paper added some rough\r\nwitticism, and informed the nobleman that his 'assiduities' would be\r\nineffectual, saying that 'the lady, with true Yankee shrewdness, accepts\r\nall offerings at her shrine, but confers no favors in return.'\r\n\r\nSo the season wore away until the Spring had again come around. I saw an\r\nannouncement in a New York paper that Evelyn Afton (her maiden name),\r\nwho had recently acquired such a brilliant reputation in London, etc.,\r\nwould perform during a short engagement at the Park Theatre. The next\r\nmorning saw me on the route to New York. I placed myself in an obscure\r\ncorner of the theatre. The curtain rose. There was a brief absence of\r\nall consciousness, and then she came upon the stage. The play was\r\nCymbeline. I know nothing of what transpired, save that when she\r\nrendered the words,--\r\n\r\n  'Oh for a horse with wings,'--\r\n\r\nthat light again appeared in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThe performance ended, and a man, feeling himself old and weary, passed\r\ninto the streets, and wandered through them till morning, wondering if\r\nhe had not in some way been connected with the brilliant being he had\r\nseen; it seemed to him that once there had been some entwining of their\r\nfates, but the recollection of it came like the indistinct memory of a\r\nhalf-impressed dream,--as if it had been in some previous condition of\r\nexistence, and the consciousness of it had lingered through a subsequent\r\nmetempsychosis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was sitting solitary in an apartment of the humble dwelling which I\r\noccupied, poring in a slow, melancholy memory over my past life, and\r\nquestioning myself when Evelyn would fulfil the promise of again\r\ninforming me of her intentions. My mood was scarcely disturbed by a\r\nknock at the outer door, which was responded to by the maid who had\r\ncharge of my children, and the next instant I was thrilled almost to\r\nstupefaction by seeing Evelyn enter the room.\r\n\r\n'I've come! I've come!' she cried, in wild eagerness. 'Have you not\r\nexpected me? I'm home--home once more. Dearest--lover--husband--I'm\r\nhere, never to leave you!'\r\n\r\nI only gasped forth--'Evelyn!'\r\n\r\nI knew not but it was an illusion.\r\n\r\nThen she threw herself upon me, and covered me with kisses, uttered a\r\nvolume of passionate endearments, entwined her arms about me in all\r\ntender embraces. I reasoned with myself that it was a dream, and would\r\nnot stir lest it should dissolve.\r\n\r\nShe stood above me, and again I saw that light in her eyes. Then for the\r\nfirst time I understood its import. Oh! the strange, deep, glorious\r\nlight of love and resolute devotion.\r\n\r\nI rose falteringly, and asked in feeble accents,--'Is it you, Evelyn?\r\nHave you indeed come?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, your Evelyn at last,--come to your arms and your heart. Your\r\nown Evelyn, so long unworthy of you. Will you receive me?'\r\n\r\nI but threw my arms around her, and sank down with her on my breast.\r\nNature exhausted itself in the intensity of that embrace. Language was\r\ndenied to emotion. For some moments she lay like a child, nestling to my\r\nheart, then suddenly started up and disappeared in the hall. Again I\r\nthought it was a dream, and that it had fled. She reappeared, bearing a\r\nsmall casket, which in a quick, frantic sort of way she thrust on the\r\ntable, opened and pulled out gold pieces, jewels and bank notes,\r\nflinging them down, some on the table and some on the floor, exclaiming,\r\n'See, you ruined yourself for me, and I have come to repay you. Look,\r\nall these your Evelyn brings to testify to her love. The children!' she\r\nexclaimed, as she threw out the last contents,--'where are they? Come,\r\nshow me.' She seized the lamp, and, grasping my arm, dragged me in my\r\nhalf-bewildered state to the next apartment, where the infants lay\r\nsleeping. She flung herself eagerly but tenderly upon them, and devoured\r\nthem with kisses. 'Now you will love them, for my sake,' she said; and,\r\nfor the first time since discovering that she loved me not, I bestowed\r\nupon them a voluntary paternal caress--I bowed over them and gently\r\nkissed their foreheads. Her love for them had restored them to my heart.\r\n\r\nThen again, with her wild, impetuous manner, she led me back to the\r\nother room. I sat upon the sofa and drew her to my breast. She lay\r\npassive a moment, then started up and paced the floor, with rapid\r\nutterances, broken with half sobs and half laughter. She returned to me,\r\nand again repeated this, till finally interrupted with a violent fit of\r\ncoughing, occasioned, as I supposed, by excitement.\r\n\r\n'Be calm, Evelyn,' I said. 'Come and lie in my arms. This joy is too\r\ngreat for me to realize. I must feel you on my bosom to convince me that\r\nI am not deceived.'\r\n\r\nSo she reposed in my arms, and--with broken sobs, the intervals of which\r\ngradually increased, she finally slept. A lethargy also fell upon me,\r\nwhich endured how long I know not. As I returned to wakefulness, I\r\nshuddered with a cold thrill, such as one might feel on suddenly finding\r\nhimself in the presence of a spirit; for I heard what was of more\r\nterrible meaning to me than any other sound. The rest of the precious\r\nsleeper at my side was disturbed frequently by a short, husky cough,\r\nfollowed by a low moan as of dull pain. Well I knew the prediction\r\nconveyed by those sounds. Long watchings by the bedside of a\r\nslowly-dying mother had made me fearfully familiar with them. Through\r\nthe lingering hours of that night I sat listening to them with an\r\nagonized ear, and in my bitterness I almost cursed Heaven for providing\r\nthe doom I anticipated.\r\n\r\nAt the first glimpse of morning I bore her carefully to the side of the\r\nsleeping children, and, after replacing in the casket its contents, sped\r\nto the house of the physician whom I have previously mentioned, and,\r\nleaving word for immediate attendance, hastened back, and resumed my\r\nwatch. Oh! in the dawn how pallid and sunken the features which I had so\r\noften seen flushed and full with the animation of life and genius!\r\nEvelyn woke and smiled peacefully on me, but lay as if still exhausted\r\nwith weariness. The physician came. He was already aware that my wife\r\nhad been engaged in her profession, though ignorant of the objects which\r\nhad induced her to it. I informed him of my apprehensions. Conducting\r\nhim to Evelyn, I excused his presence by stating my fear that she might\r\nrequire his advice after her excitement and fatigue. With skillful\r\ncaution he observed her, and in conversation elicited the statement that\r\nsome months since she had been ill from exposure. She had recovered, she\r\nsaid, and was entirely well, except that occasionally slight exertion\r\nprostrated her. Even while she spoke the monitor was continually making\r\nitself heard.\r\n\r\nI drew him to the other apartment, and in a hoarse whisper said,--'Well,\r\nyour verdict;--but I know it already from your countenance.'\r\n\r\n'If you were wealthy,' he replied--\r\n\r\n'Wealthy! I am rich--rich,' I interrupted him. 'Look!' (with this I\r\nopened the casket, and run my fingers through the glittering contents,\r\nlike a miser through his coin.) 'Tell me what wealth can do, and these\r\nshall do it. To gain these she has imperiled life. Let them restore it\r\nif they can.'\r\n\r\nI saw suspicion on his countenance. 'It is false,' I exclaimed, 'false!\r\nI tell you she is as pure as heaven. It was for me that she earned all\r\nthese.' And I dashed them on the floor and ground them under my feet.\r\n\r\nHe seized me and was weeping. 'You are mad,' he said. 'I believe you.\r\nNow I understand all. Do not delay. Take her to Italy, and may Heaven\r\npreserve her to you.'\r\n\r\nIn a week's time we were on our voyage, accompanied by the children and\r\nthe physician--the latter professing to Evelyn that he desired to make\r\nthe tour of Europe. My own apology for the voyage was a wish to complete\r\nthe tour previously interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe passage was long and tedious. Before reaching our destination my\r\nhopes of Evelyn's recovery had vanished. Her demeanor was so gentle,\r\nchildlike and affectionate, my heart was wrung with anguish. I could not\r\nbreak her sweet serenity by disclosing the fate which was impending. She\r\nseemed to have reached a period of the most holy and perfect\r\nsatisfaction. All the suppressed bitterness of former years--all the\r\nearnest resolution of the later time--had vanished, and she rested happy\r\nin the enjoyment of our mutual love. This quiet assisted the process of\r\ndestruction. Had there been something to rouse her old energy, I am\r\nconfident she would have made a desperate, perhaps successful, struggle\r\nfor life. But I could not force myself to excite it by a warning against\r\nthe insidious destroyer.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival she was in a deplorable condition of weakness. She\r\nimputed this debility to the voyage. Day by day I saw the flame of life\r\ndwindling, but she was unsuspicious, and only wondered that her recovery\r\nwas so slow. Once, as she was watching, in a half-declining position,\r\nthe setting sun, and talking of the happy days to come, I could contain\r\nmyself no longer, but burst forth into a frenzy of sobbing.\r\n\r\n'Evelyn,' I said, 'you are dying. You know it not, but, oh God, it is\r\ntrue. You are dying before me, and I can not save you. Perhaps it is too\r\nlate for you to save yourself.'\r\n\r\nAt first she supposed that my emotion was only the undue result of\r\nanxiety for her, but as I grew calmer, and told her more precisely my\r\nmeaning, and the causes of my fears, she said, with something of her old\r\nfirmness,--\r\n\r\n'If this be true, let me become fully convinced. Call in Dr. ----, and\r\nleave me alone with him. I have not thought of dying, but should have\r\nknown that my present happiness was too exquisite to last.'\r\n\r\nI sent in the doctor, and he told her all. What passed between us, on my\r\nreturn, is too sacred for relation. It is enough that the bitterness of\r\nthat hour filled all the capacity of the human heart for anguish and\r\ndespair. Afterwards we became more reconciled to the dispositions of\r\nHeaven.\r\n\r\nThe history of her gradual decline need not be related--the hopes, the\r\nsuspense, the disappointments--the reviving indications of health, the\r\nincreasing symptoms of fatal disease--the flush and brilliancy as of\r\nexuberant vitality--the fading of all the hues of life--all the\r\nvicissitudes of the unrelenting progress of decay--one after another,\r\nresolving themselves into the lineaments of death.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed too late.\r\n\r\nFrank still remained in Florence, but had discarded the society of his\r\nbachelor friends for that of the young lady previously mentioned, who\r\nwas now entitled to call him husband.\r\n\r\nSoon after our arrival I called upon him, announced Evelyn's illness,\r\nwith its hopeless character. The young man was shocked. He had never\r\nthought of disease or death in connection with Evelyn. Who could?\r\nBesides, I could read in his face a horror mixed with thankfulness at\r\nthe escape, as his memory recalled the madness which would have urged to\r\nguilt, her who was about to leave the scenes of earthly passion. I\r\ninvited him to return with me. He did so, and I left him alone with\r\nEvelyn. I knew that his presence would now give her no shock.\r\n\r\nWhat passed between them I never heard; but it was not beyond\r\nconjecture. The method of his regard for her subsequently, fully\r\nrevealed it. It was the most lofty and refined feeling of which humanity\r\nis capable--the worship of the artist--the friendship of the man.\r\n\r\nWell,--the last scene arrived. We knew that the time had come. It was,\r\nas she had hoped, at sunset. She gazed long at the changing splendors of\r\nthe western sky. 'Such,' she said, 'is death. Life merely revolves away\r\nfrom us, but the soul still shines the same upon another sphere. The\r\nfaith that invests death with terror is a false one. We pass from one\r\nworld to another--drop one style of existence for a higher. We enter on\r\na life in which may be realized all which here we have vainly sought\r\nfor. The soul-longings shall all be there fulfilled. Come soon--all of\r\nyou. I shall be waiting you. There love and friendship--unsullied and\r\nunruffled--without passion or misconception--will give perpetual\r\nhappiness.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so she passed away. This is the tenth anniversary of her death. We\r\nbore hither all that was left of her to us, and Frank's chisel has\r\nmarked her resting place. Her children are beside her, and I wait\r\nimpatiently the time when I may enter with them on that existence where\r\nthe budding affections of earth shall blossom into immortal enjoyment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bell ceased his narrative, I pressed his hand, and without words\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nAbout noon next day the rumor circulated through the streets that he was\r\ndead. I hastened to his house, and learned that it was true. He had been\r\nfound at a late hour of the morning lying on his bed, dressed as I had\r\nleft him. Physicians made an examination of the corpse, and attributed\r\nthe cause to apoplexy. I did not lament him, for I knew his spirit was\r\nin the embrace of the loved ones who went before him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSELF-RELIANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the eaglets' tender wings are feathered\r\n    The old eagles crowd them from the nest;\r\n  Down they flutter till their plumes have gathered\r\n    Strength to lift them to the granite crest\r\n    Of the hills their eldest sires possessed.\r\n\r\n  When the one cub of the lordly lions\r\n    Strikes the earth and shakes his bristling mane,\r\n  Forth they lash him, though he growl defiance,\r\n    O'er the sand-waste to pursue his gain,--\r\n    Shaggy Nimrod of the desert plain!\r\n\r\n  Still the eagles watch out from the eyrie\r\n    On the mountains, their young heirs to screen;\r\n  The old lions on the hot sand-prairie,--\r\n    If some peril track their cub,--unseen,\r\n    Stealthier than the Bedouin, glide between.\r\n\r\n  So the noblest of earth's creatures noble\r\n    Are cast forth to find their way alone,\r\n  So our manhood, in its day of trouble,\r\n    Is but crowded from the sheltering zone\r\n    And broad love-wings, to achieve its throne.\r\n\r\n  We are left to battle, not forsaken,\r\n    Watched in secret by our awful Sire;\r\n  Left to conquer, lest our spirits weaken,\r\n    And forget to wrestle and aspire,\r\n     Finding all things prompter than desire.\r\n\r\n  He hath hid the everlasting presence\r\n    Of his Godhead from the world he made,\r\n  Veiled his incommunicable essence\r\n    In thick darkness of thick clouds arrayed,\r\n    On our bold search flashing through the shade.\r\n\r\n  We are gods in veritable seeming\r\n    When we struggle for our vacant thrones,\r\n  But are earthlings beyond God's redeeming\r\n    While we lean, and creep, and beg in moans,\r\n    And base kneeling cramps our knitted bones.\r\n\r\n  Strength is given us, and a field for labor,\r\n    Boundless vigor and a boundless field;\r\n  Not to eat the harvests of our neighbor,\r\n    But our own fate's reaping-hook to wield--\r\n    Gathering only what our lands may yield;\r\n\r\n  If perchance it may be wheat or darnel,\r\n    Bitter herbs to medicine a wrong,\r\n  Stinging thistles round a haunted charnel,\r\n    Or rich wines to make us glad and strong,--\r\n    Fitting fruits that to each mood belong.\r\n\r\n  While such power and scope to us are given,\r\n    Who shall bind us to the triumph-car\r\n  Of some victor soul, before us driven,\r\n    Earlier hero in the work and war,\r\n    Him to mimic, humbly and afar?\r\n\r\n  No! we will not stoop, and fawn and follow;\r\n    There are victories for our hands to win,\r\n  Rocks to rive, and stubborn glebes to mellow,\r\n    Outward trials leagued to foes within;\r\n    Earth and self to purify from sin.\r\n\r\n  No! our spirits shall not cringe and grovel,\r\n    Stooping lowly to a low thoughts door,\r\n  As if Heaven were straitened to a hovel,\r\n    All its star-worlds set to rise no more,\r\n    And our genius had no wings to soar.\r\n\r\n  Truths bequeathed us are for lures to action;\r\n    Not for grave-stones fane and altar stand,\r\n  Tempting men to wait the resurrection\r\n    Of old prophets from their sunsets grand,--\r\n    Rather mile-stones towards the Promised Land,\r\n\r\n  Gird your mantles and bind on your sandals,\r\n    Each man marching by his own birth-star;\r\n  God will crown us when those glimmering candles\r\n    Swell to suns as forth we track them far,--\r\n    Suns that bear our throne and victory-bannered car!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE HUGUENOT FAMILIES IN AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe celebrated 'Edict of Nantes' was, to speak accurately, a new\r\nconfirmation of former treaties between the French government and the\r\nProtestants, or _Huguenots_--in fact, a royal act of indemnity for all\r\npast offences. The verdicts against the '_Reformed_' were annulled and\r\nerased from the rolls of the Superior Courts, and to them unlimited\r\nliberty of conscience was recognized as a right. This important and\r\nsolemn Edict marked for France the close of the Middle Ages, and the\r\ntrue commencement of modern times; it was sealed with the great seal of\r\ngreen wax, to testify its irrevocable and perpetual character. In\r\nsigning this great document, Henry IV. completely triumphed over the\r\nusages of the Middle Ages, and the illustrious monarch wished nothing\r\nless than to grant to the 'Reformed' all the civil and religious rights\r\nwhich had been refused them by their enemies. For the first time France\r\nraised itself above religious parties. Still, a state policy so new\r\ncould not fail to excite the clamors of the more violent, and the hatred\r\nof factions. The sovereign, however, remained firm. 'I have enacted the\r\nEdict,' said Henry to the Parliament of Paris,--'I wish it to be\r\nobserved. My will must serve as the reason why. I am king. I speak to\r\nyou as king.--I will be obeyed.' To the clergy he said, 'My predecessors\r\nhave given you good words, but I, with my gray jacket,--I will give you\r\ngood deeds. I am all gray on the outside, but I'm all gold within.'\r\nPraise to those noble sentiments, peace was maintained in the realm; the\r\nhonor of which alone belongs to Henry IV.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the seventeenth century, there could be counted in\r\nFrance more than eight hundred Reformed churches, with sixty-two\r\nConferences. Such was the prosperity and powerful organization of the\r\nProtestant party until the fall of La Rochelle, which was emphatically\r\ncalled the citadel of 'the Reform.' This misfortune terminated the\r\nreligious wars of France. The Huguenots, now excluded from the\r\nemployment of the civil service and the court, became the industrial\r\narms of the kingdom. They cultivated the fine lands of the Cevennes, the\r\nvineyards of Guienne, the cloths of Caen. In their hands were almost\r\nentirely the maritime trade of Normandy, with the silks and taffetas of\r\nLyons, and, from even the testimony of their enemies, they combined with\r\nindustry, frugality, integrity all those commercial virtues, which were\r\nhallowed by earnest love of religion and a constant fear of God. The\r\nvast plains which they owned in Bearn waved with bounteous harvests.\r\nLanguedoc, so long devastated by civil wars, was raised from ruin by\r\ntheir untiring industry. In the diocese of Nimes was the valley of\r\nVannage, renowned for its rich vegetation. Here the Huguenots had more\r\nthan sixty churches or 'temples,' and they called this region '_Little\r\nCanaan_.' Esperon, a lofty summit of the Cevennes, filled with sparkling\r\nsprings and delicious wild flowers, was known as '_Hort-dieu_' the\r\ngarden of the Lord.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant party in France did not confine themselves to\r\nmanufactures and commerce, but entered largely into the liberal\r\npursuits. Many of the 'Reformed' distinguished themselves as physicians,\r\nadvocates and writers, contributing largely to the literary glory of the\r\nage of Louis XIV. In all the principal cities of the kingdom, the\r\nHuguenots maintained colleges, the most flourishing of which were those\r\nat Orange, Caen, Bergeracs and Nimes, etc. etc. To the Huguenot\r\ngentlemen, in the reign of Louis XIII. and Louis XIV., France was\r\nindebted for her most brilliant victories. Marshal Rantzan, brave and\r\ndevoted, received no less than sixty wounds, lost an arm, a leg, and an\r\neye, his heart alone remaining untouched, amidst his many battles. Need\r\nwe add the names of Turenne, one of the greatest tacticians of his day,\r\nwith Schomberg, who, in the language of Madame de Sevigne, 'was a hero\r\nalso,' or glorious Duquesne, the conqueror of De Ruyter? He beat the\r\nSpaniards and English by sea, bombarded Genoa and Algiers, spreading\r\nterror among the bold corsairs of the Barbary States; the Moslemin\r\ntermed him 'The old French captain who had wedded the sea, and whom the\r\nangel of death had forgotten.' All these were illustrious leaders, with\r\ncrowds of distinguished officers, and belonged to the Reformed religion.\r\nWonderful and strange to relate, in the midst of all this national\r\nhappiness and prosperity, the kingdom of France was again to appear\r\nbefore the world as the persecutor of her best citizens, the destroyer\r\nof her own vital interests. The Edict of Nantes was revoked on 22d\r\nOctober, 1685. It is not our purpose to name the causes of this suicidal\r\npolicy, as they are indelibly written on the pages of our world's\r\nhistory, nor shall we point to the well-known provisions of this insane\r\nand bloody act. In a word, Protestant worship was abolished throughout\r\nFrance, under the penalty of arrest, with the confiscation of goods.\r\nHuguenot ministers were to quit the kingdom in a fortnight. Protestant\r\nschools were closed, and the laity were forbidden to follow their\r\nclergy, under severe and fatal penalties. All the strict laws concerning\r\nheretics were again renewed. But, in spite of all these enactments,\r\ndangers and opposition, the Huguenots began to leave France by\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nMany entreated the court, but in vain, for permission to withdraw\r\nthemselves from France. This favor was only granted to the Marshal de\r\nSchomberg and the Marquis de Ruoigny, on condition of their retiring to\r\nPortugal and England. Admiral Duquesne, then aged eighty, was strongly\r\nurged by the king to change his religion. 'During sixty years,' said the\r\nold hero, showing his gray hairs,' I have rendered unto Cæsar the things\r\nwhich I owe to Cæsar; permit me now, sire, to render unto God the thing\r\nwhich I owe to God.' He was permitted to end his days in his native\r\nland. The provisions of the Edict were carried out with inflexible\r\nrigor. In the month of June, 1686, more than six hundred of the Reformed\r\ncould be counted in the galleys at Marseilles, and nearly as many in\r\nthose of Toulon, and the most of them condemned by the decision of a\r\nsingle marshal (de Mortieval). Fortunately for the refugees, the guards\r\nalong the coast did not at all times faithfully execute the royal\r\norders, but often aided the escape of the fugitives. Nor were the, land\r\nfrontiers more faithfully guarded. In our day, it is impossible to state\r\nthe correct numbers of the Protestant emigration. Assuming that one\r\nhundred thousand Protestants were distributed among twenty millions of\r\nRoman Catholics, we think it safe to calculate that from two hundred and\r\nfifty to three hundred thousand, during fifteen years, expatriated\r\nthemselves from France. Sismondi estimates their number at three or four\r\nhundred thousand. Reaching London, Amsterdam or Berlin, the refugees\r\nwere received with open purses and arms, and England, America, Germany,\r\nSwitzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Prussia, and Holland, all profited\r\nby this wholesale proscription of Frenchmen. All agree that these\r\nProtestant emigrants were among the bravest, the most industrious, loyal\r\nand pious in the kingdom of France, and that they carried with them the\r\narts by which they had enriched their own land, and abundantly repaid\r\nthe hospitality of those countries which afforded them that asylum\r\ndenied them in their own.\r\n\r\nThe influence which the Huguenot refugees especially exerted upon trade\r\nand manufactures in those countries where they settled, was very\r\nstriking and lasting. England and Holland, of all other nations, owe\r\ngratitude to the Protestants of France for the various branches of\r\nindustry introduced by them, and which have greatly contributed in\r\nmaking their 'merchants princes,' and, their 'traffickers the honorable\r\nof the earth.' We refer to these nations particularly, because they are\r\nso intimately connected with the colonization of our own favored land.\r\nThe Huguenot refugees in England introduced the silk factories in\r\nSpitalfields, using looms like those of Lyons and of Tours. They also\r\ncommenced the manufacture of fine linen, calicoes, sail-cloth,\r\ntapestries, and paper, most of which had before been imported from\r\nFrance. It has been estimated that these refugees thus brought into\r\nGreat Britain a trade which deprived France of an annual income of\r\nnearly ten millions of dollars. Science, arms, jurisprudence and\r\nliterature, were also advanced by their arrival. The _first_ newspaper\r\nin Ireland was published by the Pastor Droz, a refugee, who also founded\r\na library in Dublin. Thelluson (Lord Redlesham), a brave soldier in the\r\nPeninsular war, General Ligonier, General Prevost of the British army,\r\nSir Samuel Romilly, Majendie, Bishop of Chester, Henry Layard, the\r\nexcavator of Nineveh, all are the descendants of the French Huguenots.\r\nSaurin secured the reputation of his powerful eloquence at the Hague;\r\nbut in the French Church, Threadneedle street, London, he reached the\r\nsummit of his splendid pulpit eloquence. Most of the Huguenots who fled\r\nto England for an asylum were natives of Normandy, Brittany, Picardy,\r\nand Guienne. Their numbers at the revocation may be calculated at eighty\r\nthousand. Hume estimates them at fifty thousand, another writer at\r\nseventy thousand, but we believe these calculations are too low. In\r\n1676, the communicants of the Protestant French Church at Canterbury\r\nreached not less than twenty-five hundred. Of all the services of the\r\nHuguenots to England, none was more important than the energetic support\r\nto the Prince of Orange against James II. The Prince employed no less\r\nthan seven hundred and thirty-six French officers, brave men who had\r\nbeen learned to conquer under the banner of Turenne and Condi. Schomberg\r\nwas the hero at the battle of Boyne. One of his standards bore a BIBLE,\r\nsupported on three swords, with the motto--'_Ie maintiendray_.' The\r\ngallant old man, now eighty-two years of age, fell mortally wounded, but\r\ntriumphing, and with his dying eyes he saw the soldiers of James\r\nvanquished, and dispersed in headlong flight. Ruoigny, in the same\r\nbattle, received a mortal wound, and, covered with blood, before the\r\nadvancing French refugee regiments, cheered them on, crying, 'Onward, my\r\nlads, to glory! onward to glory!'\r\n\r\nIn England, the French Protestants long remained as a distinct people,\r\npreserving in a good degree a nationality of their own, but in the lapse\r\nof years this disappeared. One hardly knows in our day where to find a\r\ngenuine Saxon,--'pure English undefiled,'--for the Huguenot blood\r\ncirculates beneath many a well-known patronymic. Who would imagine that\r\nanything French could be traced in the colorless names of White and\r\nBlack, or the authoritative ones of King and Masters? Still it is a\r\nwell-known fact that such names, at the close of the last century,\r\ndelighted in the designations of Leblanck (White), Lenoir (Black),\r\nLoiseau (Bird), Lejeune (Young), Le Tonnellier (Cooper), Lemaitre\r\n(Master), Leroy (King). These names were thus translated into good\r\nstrong Saxon, the owners becoming one with the English in feeling,\r\nlanguage, and religion. Holland, too, glorious Protestant Holland! the\r\nfatherland of American myriads, welcomed the fugitive Huguenots. From\r\nthe beginning of the Middle Ages that noble land had been a hospitable\r\nhome for the persecuted from all parts of Europe. During the last twenty\r\nyears of the seventeenth century, the French emigration into that\r\ncountry became a political event. Amsterdam granted to all citizenship,\r\nwith freemen's privilege of trade, and exemption of taxes for three\r\nyears; and all the other towns of that nation rivalled each other in the\r\nsame liberal and Christian spirit. In the single year of the revocation,\r\nmore than two hundred and fifty Huguenot preachers reached the free soil\r\nof the United Provinces. Pensions were allowed to them, the married\r\nreceiving four hundred florins, those in celibacy two hundred. The\r\nPrince of Orange attached two French preachers to his person, with many\r\nFrench officers to his army against James II.--thanks to the generous\r\nPrincess of Orange, who selected several Huguenot dames as ladies of\r\nhonor. One house at Harlaem was exclusively reserved for young ladies of\r\nnoble birth. At the Hague, an ancient convent of preaching monks was\r\nchanged into an asylum for the persecuted ladies. Of all lands which\r\nreceived the refugees, none witnessed such crowds as the Republic of\r\nHolland; and hence Boyle called it '_the grand arch of the refugees_.'\r\nNo documents exactly compute their number; one author calculates it at\r\nfifty-five thousand, and another, in 1686, at nearly seventy-five\r\nthousand souls. In the Dutch Republic and Germany, as was the result in\r\nEngland, the Huguenots exercised a most powerful influence on politics,\r\nliterature, war, and religion, and industry and commerce. Holland,\r\ncontrary to the general expectation, outlived the invasion of 1672, the\r\nPrince of Orange fortunately checking the designs of Louis XIV. Refugee\r\nsoldiers had powerfully contributed to the triumph of his cause in\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland, and then they followed him, with valor,\r\nin the war against Louis XIV., which compelled that monarch to sue for\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nLiterary men and preachers obtained repose and liberty in that land,\r\nwith consideration and honor. Amsterdam alone received sixteen banished\r\nrefugee ministers; and more than two hundred spread themselves through\r\nall the towns of the United Provinces. Very eloquent French pastors\r\nfilled the pulpits of the Hague, Rotterdam, Leyden, and Harlaem. Their\r\nmost brilliant orator was James Saurin. Abbaddié, hearing him for the\r\nfirst time, exclaimed, 'Is this a man or an angel, who is speaking to\r\nus?' Let us dwell a moment upon the character of this wonderful man. By\r\nthe elevation of his thoughts and brilliancy of imagination, his\r\nluminous expositions, purity of style, with vigor of expression, he\r\nproduced the most profound impression on the refugees and others who\r\ncrowded to hear his varied eloquence. What charmed them most was the\r\nunion in his style of Genevese zeal and earnestness with southern ardor,\r\nand especially those solemn prayers, with which he loved to close his\r\ndiscourses. Saurin displayed in these petitions strains of supplication\r\nwhich up to this time among the Hollanders had never been observed in\r\nany other preacher.\r\n\r\nAll the branches of human learning were advanced in Holland by the\r\nProtestant Frenchmen. Here no fetters on genius, no secret censorship or\r\npersecution, existed. The boldest democratic theories, with the most\r\ndaring philosophic systems, were freely discussed, and the refugees\r\npromoted this spirit of investigation. They also increased the commerce\r\nand manufactures and agriculture of the Netherlands, and rendered\r\nAmsterdam one of the most famous cities of the world. Like the ancient\r\ncity of Tyre, which the prophet named the 'perfection of beauty,' her\r\nmerchant princes traded with all islands and nations. Macpherson, in his\r\nAnnals of Commerce, estimates the annual loss to France, caused by the\r\nrefugees establishing themselves in England and Holland, was not less\r\nthan 3,582,000 pounds sterling, or about ninety millions of francs.\r\nUntil the close of the eighteenth century, the descendants of the\r\nHuguenots in Holland were united among themselves, by intermarriage and\r\nthe bonds of mutual sympathies. But in time a fusion with the Dutch\r\nbecame inevitable. Then, in Holland, as was the case with England and\r\nGermany, many refugees, abjuring their nationality, changed their French\r\nnames into Dutch. The Leblancs called themselves De Witt,--the\r\nDeschamps, Van de Velde,--the Dubois, Van den Bosch,--the Chevaliers,\r\nRuyter,--the Legrands, De Groot, etc. etc. With the change of names,\r\nHuguenot churches began to disappear, so that out of sixty-two which\r\ncould be counted among the seven provinces in 1688, eleven only now\r\nremain,--among them those at Hague, Amsterdam, Leyden, Utrecht,\r\nRotterdam, and Groningen. These are the last monuments of the Huguenot\r\nemigration to Holland, and a certain number of families preserve some\r\nsentiment of nationality, who consider themselves honored by their\r\nFrench, noble, Protestant origin, while at the same time they are united\r\nby patriotic affection to their newly adopted country.\r\n\r\nThis rapid chapter of the expulsion of the 'Huguenots,' or\r\n'Protestants,' or 'Refugees,' from their native land, with their\r\nsettlement in England and Holland, seem necessary for a better\r\nunderstanding of our subject. Thence, they emigrated to America, and it\r\nis our object to collect something concerning their origin and\r\ndescendants among us. The Huguenots of America is a volume which still\r\nremains fully and correctly to be written. This is a period when\r\nincreased attention and study are directed to historical subjects, and\r\nwe gladly will contribute what mite we may possess to the important\r\nobject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK WITCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n'A witch,' according to my nurse's account, 'must be a haggard old\r\nwoman, living in a little rotten cottage under a hill by a wood-side,\r\nand must be frequently spinning by the door; she must have a black cat,\r\ntwo or three broom-sticks, and must be herself of so dry a nature, that\r\nif you fling her into a river she will not sink: so hard then is her\r\nfate, that, if she is to undergo the trial, if she does not drown she\r\nmust be burnt, as many have been within the memory of man.'\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND ABOUT OUR COAL FIRE.\r\n\r\nIn a bustling New England village there lived, not many years ago, a\r\npoor, infirm, deformed little old woman, who was known to the\r\nmiddle-aged people living there and thereabout as 'Aunt Hannah.' The\r\nyounger members of the little community had added another and very\r\nodious title to the 'Aunt'--they called her 'Aunt Hannah, the Black\r\nWitch.' Not that she was of negro blood. Her pale, pinched and patient\r\nface was white as the face of a corpse; so, also, was her thin hair,\r\ncombed smoothly down under the plain cap she always wore. Very white\r\nindeed she was, as to face, and hair, and cap, but otherwise she was all\r\nand always black, especially so as regarded an ugly pair of gloves,\r\nwhich were never removed from her hands, so far as the youngsters were\r\naware, and which added to the fearfully mysterious aspect of those\r\nmembers. Exactly what they covered, the children never knew, but they\r\nsaw that one hideous glove enclosed something like a gigantic, withered\r\nbird's claw, while within the other there musts have been a repulsive\r\nand horrid knob, without proper form, and lacking any remotest attempt\r\nat thumb and fingers.\r\n\r\nThese shapeless members, forever covered from the world, wrought fearful\r\nimages in the minds of the children, and their youthful imaginations\r\nconjured up all sorts of uses to which such strange members might be\r\napplied. Upon one point they were agreed. There was no doubt in any\r\nlittle head among them that Aunt Hannah had at some time sold herself to\r\nSatan, and that he had placed this deformity upon her as a mark of\r\nownership. Then she had a humped back, poor woman, the result of the\r\ncruel weight of many weary years; and she leaned upon an old-fashioned\r\nstaff with a curved and crutch-like handle; and her bleared eyes were\r\nbent forever on the ground; and her thin lips twitched convulsively, and\r\nshe muttered to herself as she crawled about the village streets; and\r\nit was said by those who knew, that she was nearly a hundred years of\r\nage. So the youngsters called her the 'Black Witch,' and sometimes\r\nhooted after her in the streets, or hobbled on before her with bowed\r\nheads and ridiculous affectation of infirmity. Thanks to her evil name,\r\nnone of them ever ventured to actually assault the poor old creature,\r\nand their taunts she bore with patient meekness, going ever quietly upon\r\nher accustomed, peaceful way.\r\n\r\nThe older villagers regarded her with a pity that was half pity and half\r\ndisgust. Those fearful hands they never could forget, nor the bowed\r\nfigure, nor the strange working of the lips. Therefore, they held her in\r\na sort of dreading, but still her lonely life, and her patient,\r\nuncomplaining spirit, moved their hearts. Then a vague\r\ntradition--nothing more, for neither kith nor kin had ancient Hannah--a\r\nvague tradition said that she had once been very beautiful; that when\r\nshe was in her fresh and lovely youth, some strange misfortune had\r\nfallen upon her, and that she had worn since then--most innocently--the\r\nmark of a direful tragedy. One lady, old, nearly, as Aunt Hannah, but\r\nupon whom there had never fallen any blight of poverty or wrong, loved\r\nthe poor creature well, and she only, of all the inhabitants of the\r\nvillage, frequently entered the cottage where the 'Black Witch' dwelt.\r\nThis lady, it was said, had known her when both were young, and carried\r\nforever locked in her heart the story of that saddened youth. None\r\ncalled good Mrs. Marjoram a witch. _Her_ face was clear, her smile\r\nbright, her eyes sparkling, and she bore her years with an upright and\r\ncheerful carriage.\r\n\r\nThe little, one-storied house where Aunt Hannah dwelt was situated in a\r\nhollow just out of the village, in the shadow of a grove of tangled\r\nhemlocks and pines. It consisted of two rooms only, with an unfinished\r\nattic overhead; and before her door the poor old soul might be seen any\r\npleasant day, sitting meekly in the sun. She could neither knit nor sew\r\nas other old women do, but she sat there waiting patiently for the time\r\nwhen her kind Father should call her home, to lose forever the blackness\r\nthat clung to her in this weary world.\r\n\r\nShe did not live here entirely alone, for, true to the universal\r\nreputation of witches, she kept, not one cat only, but several; all\r\nblack cats, too. It was the only fancy she indulged in, the only luxury\r\nshe allowed herself, and it was sad that this harmless freak should cost\r\nher so many taunts. Sometimes the boys tried to kill her cats, aided in\r\nthe murderous attempt by the village dogs, but no dog ever came back\r\nscatheless from those sharp and spiteful claws. Hence the boys were\r\ncertain as to the witchcraft, and 'knew' that these savage animals were\r\ntrue imps of Satan.\r\n\r\nThis weak and defenceless creature, living thus apart from human\r\ncompanionship, was supported on a small annuity, paid her quarterly by a\r\nvery honest company, that would have been ruined with many such\r\nvenerable clients. On pleasant days she crept about the town to do her\r\nmeagre marketing, or crawled to the paupers' pew in the old brick\r\nmeeting-house. During the warm summer weather her scant life was\r\nsomewhat cheered, and a faint attempt at joyousness sometimes winked in\r\nher old eyes, but with the winter's cold came the cruel cramps and\r\nrheumatism, the sleepless nights and painful days. Then Mrs. Marjoram\r\nfrequently drove to her door, carrying medicines and nourishing\r\nfood,--over and above all, bringing cheerful words and a warm and hearty\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nOne winter Mrs. Marjoram was taken ill, and, being so very old, her life\r\nwas despaired of. During this sickness there came a great fall of snow,\r\npiling up four or five feet on the level, and driving and drifting into\r\nthe hollows, so that for several days the less frequented roads in that\r\npart of the country were impassible. And now, when Mrs. Marjoram, but\r\nfor her own sad plight, would have thought of poor Aunt Hannah, there\r\nwas no one enough interested to give her loneliness a moment's\r\nconsideration, till, one morning, one street lad cried out suddenly to\r\nanother that Aunt Hannah must be buried alive!\r\n\r\nBuried _alive?_ The men, suddenly summoned from their business or their\r\nleisure, hardly thought _that_ possible in the deep hollow, filled\r\nnearly to the level with heavily packed and frozen snow.\r\n\r\nMen walked out on the firm crust till they were directly over the spot\r\nwhere, full twenty feet below, stood Aunt Hannah's little house. And\r\nthey shook their heads mournfully at the sickening thought of what must\r\nlie below them.\r\n\r\nIt was a good day's work for twenty men to open a gradually descending\r\nway to the lonely house,--a good day's work; so that when they reached\r\nthe door--finding it locked inside--they sent back to the village for\r\nlanterns and candles before bursting it in.\r\n\r\nThe sight that startled and horrified them after they had forced the\r\ndoor, they never liked to speak of. The sounds from the furious,\r\nspitting and snarling cats they never forgot.\r\n\r\nHer disfigured and mutilated remains were decently interred, and when\r\nthe spring-time carried away the snow, they leveled the house with the\r\nground. But, though they buried her out of their sight and pulled down\r\nthe rotten cottage she had inhabited for so many weary years, the\r\nfearful memory of her evil name and dreadful end remained, and nearly\r\nall the village came to regard her as, in very truth, a witch.\r\n\r\nOnly Mrs. Marjoram took from the cottage with pious love an ancient and\r\nmuch-thumbed book, on whose fly-leaf was written 'Jason Fletcher, His\r\nBible.' Then, having no longer any reason to conceal the early history\r\nof the deceased, she related to the village gossips--as a warning\r\nagainst trusting too fully to evil appearances--the following\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORY OF POOR HANNAH LEE.\r\n\r\nA long time ago--before the middle of the last century, in fact--there\r\ndwelt in one of the most flourishing towns in Western Massachusetts a\r\nfamily of Puritan extraction named Fletcher. Straitest among the strict,\r\nJohn Cotton Fletcher and his wife Mehitabel held all lightness of\r\nconduct or gamesomeness of speech as sin most devoutly to be prayed and\r\nstriven against, and not only 'kept' the ten commandments with pious\r\nzeal, but, for the better serving of the Lord, invented an eleventh,\r\nwhich read 'Laugh not at all.' _Holy days_ they knew, in number during\r\nthe year fifty-four, namely, the fifty-two 'Sabbaths' and the governor's\r\nFast and Thanksgiving days; _holidays_ they held in utter abhorrence,\r\ndeeming Christmas, especially, an invention of the devil. On 'work-days'\r\nthey worked; on 'Sabbath-days' they attended the preaching of the word;\r\notherwise, on the Lord's day, doing nothing save to eat and drink what\r\nwas absolutely necessary to keep them from faintness. They lived to\r\npraise the Lord, and they must eat to live. But no cooking or other\r\nlabor was done on that day, and if the old horse was saddled to carry\r\nthem to meeting it was because that was a work of necessity. On Fast and\r\nThanksgiving days--because they were peculiarly of Puritan origin--there\r\nwas an especial effort at godliness, and woe, then, to any profaning\r\nyoungster who dared to shout or play within sound or sight of Deacon\r\nFletcher's premises. Every Saturday night, at sunset, all tools for men\r\nand playthings for children were put away, to be disturbed no more till\r\nsunset on Sunday. All papers, books, knitting-work, sewing, were\r\ndisposed of 'out of the way.' It was necessary to milk the cows, feed\r\nthe pigs, and saddle the horse, but that was all the work that was\r\nallowed. As to any jest on any holy day, that was, beyond all other\r\nthings, most abhorrent to their ideas of Christian duty. Life with them\r\nwas a continued strife against sin, cheered only by the hope of casting\r\noff all earthly trammels at last, to enter upon one long, never-ending\r\nSabbath. And their Sabbath of idleness was more dreary than their\r\n'week-day' of work.\r\n\r\nYet were they an humble, honest, and upright pair, walking purely before\r\nGod according to the light they had, and as highly respected and honored\r\nin the community, that the fiat of the minister himself--and in those\r\ndays the minister's word was 'law and gospel' in the smaller New England\r\nvillages--was hardly more potent than that of Deacon Fletcher.\r\n\r\nTo this couple was born one son, and one only. Much as they mourned when\r\nthey saw their neighbors adding almost yearly to their groups of olive\r\nbranches, the Lord in his wisdom vouchsafed to them only this one child,\r\nand they bowed meekly to the providence and tried to be content. Why his\r\nfather named the boy 'Jason,' no one could rightly tell; perhaps because\r\nthe fleece of his flocks had been truly fleece of gold to him; at all\r\nevents, thus was the child named, and in the strict rule of this\r\nChristian couple was Jason reared.\r\n\r\nIt would be sad as well as useless to tell of the dreary winter-Sundays\r\nin the cold meeting-house (it was thought a wicked weakness to have a\r\nfire in a church then) through which he shivered and froze; of the\r\nfearful sitting in the corner after the two-hours sermons and the\r\nthirty-minutes prayers were done; of the utter absence of all cheerful\r\nthemes or thoughts on the holy days which they so straitly remembered to\r\nkeep; of the visions of sudden death, and the bottomless pit thereafter,\r\nwhich haunted the child through long nights; of the sighing for green\r\nfields and the singing of birds, on some summer Sundays, when the sun\r\nwas warm and the sky was fair; and the clapping of the old-fashioned\r\nwooden seats, as the congregation rose to pray or praise, was sweeter\r\nmusic than the blacksmith made who 'led the singing' through his nose.\r\nIt would be a dreary task to follow the boy through all this youthful\r\nmisery, and so I will let it pass. Doubtless all these things brought\r\nforth their fruits when his day of freedom came. He was a large-framed,\r\nfull-blooded boy, with more than the usual allowance of animal spirits.\r\nBut his father was larger framed and tougher, and in his occasional\r\ncontests with his son victory naturally perched upon his banners, so\r\nthat the boy's spirit (which rebelled alway against the iron rule of the\r\nhousehold), if not broken down, was certainly so far kept under that it\r\nrarely showed itself. It was a slumbering volcano, ready, when it\r\nreached its strength, to pour out burning lava of passion and\r\nevil-doing.\r\n\r\nThus the boy grew up almost to manhood, with very few rays of sunshine\r\ncast over his early path to look back upon when he should Teach the\r\nmiddle eminence of life. And the gloom of the present cheerless and\r\naustere way caused him to look forward with the more rapture to that\r\ntime, when, with his twenty-first birth-day, should come the power to do\r\nas he pleased with himself: with his hours of labor and of ease, with\r\nhis Sabbath-days and his work-days.\r\n\r\nA little before the time when big majority was to come and set him\r\npartially free--for then, according to the good old Puritan custom, he\r\nwould have his 'freedom-suit,' and probably a few hundred dollars and a\r\nhorse, and might remain with his father or go elsewhere--there fell\r\nacross Jason's path a sweet gleam of golden sunshine, such as he had\r\nnever known before, nor ever dreamed of. When he was in his twenty-first\r\nyear, his father, the Deacon,--being urged thereto by the failing health\r\nof his overtasked wife,--adopted as half daughter, half serving maid, a\r\nbeautiful and friendless girl, who might otherwise have gone to ruin.\r\nHer name was plain Hannah Lee. No name can be imagined too liquid, sweet\r\nand voluptuous in its sound to typify her loveliness. It was not\r\nstrange, therefore, that she had not been long in the house before Jason\r\nFletcher, hitherto deprived of much cheerful female society, felt\r\nstealing over him a new and strange excitement of mingled joy and\r\nwonder. It is trite and tame to say that for him there came new flowers\r\nin all the fields and by all the road-sides, and a hitherto unknown\r\nfragrance in the balmy air; rosier colors to the sunset, softer tints to\r\nthe yellow gray east at dawn, brighter sparkle to the brooks, breezier\r\nglories to the mountain-tops; but, doubtless, this was strictly true, as\r\nit has been many times before and since to many other men, but scarce\r\never accompanied by so great and complete a change.\r\n\r\nHis father might have expected it, and his mother have reckoned upon it,\r\nbut no thought of love in connection with their quiet and awkward son\r\never entered into their minds, and so they put this sweet creature into\r\nthe youth's way, not reflecting that only one result--on his side, at\r\nleast--could follow.\r\n\r\nThey kept no watch upon the pair, and knew not of the many meetings,\r\naccidental, apparently, even to themselves, that took place between the\r\ninnocent youth and girl. It needs no reading of light books to make a\r\nsuccessful lover, nor grace, nor elegant carriage; and Nature points the\r\nway to the most modest and untrained wooer. So, without a word having\r\nbeen spoken on the subject, nor any caress exchanged, except, perhaps,\r\nan occasional momentarily clasped hand, or the necessary and proper\r\ncontact, when Hannah rode, sometimes, behind Jason on the pillion (one\r\narm around him to keep her in her seat), they became lovers, and none\r\nthe less so that they had given no verbal or labial utterance to their\r\nloves.\r\n\r\nAnd the summer flew by on wings of the fleetest, and Jason's\r\ntwenty-first birth-day approached.\r\n\r\nIt fell this year upon a Sunday. The family had 'been to meeting' all\r\nthe day as usual, no reference being made to the fact that the youth was\r\nnow 'free.' (His father had said to him, as they milked the cows on\r\nSaturday night, 'We will put by your \"Freedom Day\" till Monday.') But\r\nall day Jason had walked, and thought, and eaten, and drunk, not to the\r\nglory of the Lord, as his father and mother piously believed _they_ did,\r\nbut to the glory of himself--no longer a child, but a man!\r\n\r\nIt lacked a full half hour to sunset, and there was no cooler resting\r\nplace that warm summer afternoon than beneath the shade of a\r\nthick-leaved grape-vine that overspread a stunted pear tree some little\r\ndistance in the rear of the house. Hannah, with her natural love for\r\npleasant things and places, had induced Jason, some time before, to make\r\na seat for her in this charming spot. It was quite out of sight from the\r\nhouse, and the little bower the vine made could be entered only from one\r\nside. In this bower Hannah sat this sunny afternoon, wondering if it\r\nwould change Jason very much to be a boy no longer, and devoutly praying\r\nin the depths of her pure little heart that it would not.\r\n\r\nShe sat, half sadly, and not very distinctly, dreaming over this\r\nproblem, when the shade was deepened, and, looking up, she was aware\r\nthat Jason stood at the entrance to the arbor. Her heart stopped beating\r\nfor half a moment, and she felt quite faint and sick. Then she said,\r\nwith a smile, half sad, half jocose, 'You are a _man_ now, Jason, are\r\nyou not?'\r\n\r\nThere was room for two on the seat, and she moved a little toward the\r\nfurther end as she spoke.\r\n\r\n'I am a man to-day, Hannah,' he said. 'Father wants to keep me boy till\r\nto-morrow, because this is the Lord's day, and I suppose it is wicked to\r\nbe a man on Sunday. To-morrow I shall go away from here, and not come\r\nback for a long, long time.' His voice trembled, and sounded very cold\r\nand sad.\r\n\r\nHannah put her two elbows on her knees, rested her face in her hands,\r\nand uttered a little, low, wailing cry, most painful to hear.\r\n\r\nThen Jason seated himself beside her, put his arms about her, and,\r\nraising her gently up, kissed her on the cheek. He had never before\r\nkissed any woman save his mother.\r\n\r\n'When I come back,' he said, 'I will marry you, if you love me, and then\r\nwe will always live together.'\r\n\r\nThe little maid dried her eyes, and a look sweet and calm, such as,\r\nperhaps, the angels wear, stole over her innocent face.\r\n\r\n'Oh, do you love me so? Will you?' she said.\r\n\r\n'So help me God, I will,' he said.\r\n\r\nThen she put her arms about his neck, and lifting up her innocent face\r\nto his, gave him her heart in one long kiss.\r\n\r\n(Just then a light foot, passing toward the house from a neighbor's,\r\npaused at the arbor door, all unknown to those within, and little Martha\r\nHopkins, the neighbor's daughter and Hannah's special pet, looked in\r\nupon them for a moment. Then she sped quickly to Deacon Fletcher's\r\nhouse, and burst, all excitement, into the kitchen.)\r\n\r\n'Will you wait for me, Hannah, darling,' said Jason, 'all the time it\r\nmay take me to get ready for a wife, and never love any other man, nor\r\nlet any other man love you? Never forget me, for years and years,\r\nperhaps, till I come back for you? Will you always remember that we love\r\neach other, and that you are to be my wife?'\r\n\r\n'I will wait for you, dear, if I wait till I die,' she answered.\r\n\r\nHe folded her yet more closely to his breast.\r\n\r\nWhile they held each other thus, forgetting all else in the world, his\r\nfather burst, furious and terrible, into the arbor!\r\n\r\nHe seized them with a strong and cruel rasp, and tore them pitilessly\r\nasunder.\r\n\r\n'Go into the house, boy,' he cried, 'and leave this'--\r\n\r\n'Stop!' shouted Jason, springing to his feet, his face as white as death\r\nand his eyes flashing--'Stop! Do not call her any name but a good name!\r\nI would not bear it if you were twenty times my father!'\r\n\r\nThe old man stood transfixed.\r\n\r\n'She is as good as you or as my mother, and will go to heaven as well as\r\nyou when she dies,' he continued passionately; 'as well as any of us; as\r\nwell as the minister! What did you come here for? Haven't you driven my\r\nlife almost to death ever since I can remember; and isn't that enough,\r\nbut you must come here and kill my darling, my dear, my love?'\r\n\r\nHe knelt where she lay on the ground.\r\n\r\n'Hear the boy,' cried the father, in a rage equally terrible and far\r\nless noble. 'Hear the boy go on about the baggage!'\r\n\r\nThe boy still knelt, unheeding anything save the senseless form beside\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'Wasn't it enough that you should wanton with a young woman in this\r\nstyle, but you must do it on the holy Sabbath day?' the old man\r\ncontinued. 'Mother,' he cried, jerking the words over his shoulder at\r\nhis wife, who stood behind him, 'do you bring such profligates as this\r\ninto the world, to disgrace a pious man's fame and bring his house to\r\nsorrow? Let him go forth--my oldest and youngest born, and eat husks\r\nwith the swine; he shall have no portion, and there shall be no fatted\r\ncalf killed when he returns!'\r\n\r\nStill the youth knelt, and now his head had fallen upon the prostrate\r\nbody, and he was covering her cold hand with kisses.\r\n\r\n'Look here, young man,' the father cried, 'leave go that girl's hand and\r\ncome into the house; as true as there's a God in Israel I'll teach you\r\nwhat a stout rawhide is made of!'\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture neighbor Hopkins and his wife, warned by\r\nquick-flying little Martha that something terrible was going on at\r\nDeacon Fletcher's, appeared, hurrying towards the spot.\r\n\r\nPeter Hopkins was considered a somewhat ungodly but a very just man, and\r\nwhile the Deacon most highly disapproved of his spiritual state, and\r\ndoubted that he and 'vital piety' were strangers, he still respected\r\nPeter's rugged honesty and directness of purpose, and ranked him\r\nforemost among the 'world's people.' He was a man of powerful frame and\r\nstrong impulses, and when his feelings were aroused he stood in awe of\r\nno man, high or low. When he forced his way into the arbor, therefore,\r\nthe Deacon paused in his invective and made no remonstrance.\r\n\r\nPeter Hopkins at once put the worst construction on the scene before\r\nhim. He saw in the son of Deacon Fletcher only a seducer, in poor Hannah\r\nLee only a victim, and his blood rose to boiling heat. Without pausing\r\nto ask any question, grasping at one guess, as he supposed, the whole\r\nsad history, he seized Jason by the collar, and, lifting him up, dashed\r\nhim violently down again, the boy's head striking a corner of the bench\r\nas he fell.\r\n\r\nThen he took the girl tenderly up and faced about upon the father,\r\nactually foaming with wrath.\r\n\r\n'This comes of psalm singing,' he cried. 'Clear the way there!' and he\r\nbore the still unconscious maiden toward his own house.\r\n\r\nThen a sudden and strange revulsion came over Deacon Fletcher. For the\r\nfirst time, perhaps, in twenty-one years, the father's heart triumphed\r\nover the Deacon's prejudices. As he saw his son--his only son--lying\r\npale and bleeding on the ground, all recollection of his offense, all\r\nthought of sinfulness or godliness in connection with his conduct,\r\nvanished, and he only considered whether this pride of his, this strong\r\nand beautiful son, were to die there, or to live and bless him. He\r\nstooped, sobbing, over the boy, reconciled, at last, to humanity, and\r\nconscious of a strong human love.\r\n\r\nNot more tenderly was poor Hannah Lee borne to the house of Peter\r\nHopkins than the father carried the son he had only just received into\r\nhis own dwelling. There were no thoughts of husks now, but only a\r\nsorrowful joy that one so long dead to him was at length alive, that a\r\nnew heart, full of human instincts, had found birth within his bosom.\r\nBut mingled with this joy was the fear that he had only, at length,\r\npossessed his son to lose him.\r\n\r\nWhile Jason Fletcher lay tossing, week after week, through the fever\r\nthat followed the scene of violence in the arbor, poor Hannah went sadly\r\nbut patiently about the light duties that farmer Hopkins and his wife\r\nallowed her to perform.\r\n\r\nThoroughly convinced, through his wife's communications with Hannah, of\r\nthe innocence of the pair, Peter Hopkins had gone to Deacon Fletcher and\r\nremonstrated with him on his outrageous conduct.\r\n\r\n'Your son is a fine lad,' he said, 'and Hannah is fit to be queen\r\nanywhere; and if you don't give her a fitting out when he's well enough\r\nto marry her, hang me if _I_ won't! I owe the boy something for the ill\r\ntrick I played him in my hot-headedness, and he shall have it, too! Say,\r\nnow, that they shall be man and wife!'\r\n\r\nDeacon Fletcher astonished the hot-hearted man beyond measure by quietly\r\ntelling him that, God willing, his dear son should marry Hannah as soon\r\nas the visitation that now kept him on a bed of raving illness was taken\r\naway. He added meekly that he hoped God would forgive him if he had\r\nabused the trust placed in him, and, misled by a vanity of holiness, had\r\ndone his son great wrong, these many years.\r\n\r\n'Give us your hand, Deacon,' cried the delighted pleader; 'you are a\r\ngood man, if you _are_ a Deacon, and that's more'n I'd have said a week\r\nago! You _have_ hurt that boy, and no mistake! You've either beaten the\r\nspirit all out of him, or you have shut up a devil in him that'll break\r\nout one o' these days, worse'n them that went into the pigs that we read\r\nabout! But 'tain't too late to mend, an' if a stitch in time _does_ save\r\nnine, it's better to take the _nine_ stitches than to wait till they are\r\nninety times nine. You've got to be a thousand times kinder to the boy\r\nthan you would if you hadn't been so hard on him all his life.'\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that while the fever held its course nothing should be\r\nsaid to poor Hannah, and so the two men parted--warm friends for the\r\nfirst time in their lives.\r\n\r\nAnd poor Hannah Lee went droopingly and patiently about her duties,\r\nasking quietly from day to day as to the health of Jason, and telling no\r\nsoul how her heart seemed breaking within her, and how all the future\r\nlooked to her like a dreary waste.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hopkins threw out gentle hints that the Deacon might relent, and\r\nthat if he did the wish that was ever in Hannah's heart might be\r\nrealized. But the poor child paid little heed to her suggestions, a\r\nforeshadowing of some direful calamity constantly enfolding and\r\nsaddening her. Still she kept bravely and quietly about her duties, and\r\nit was only when she was alone in her chamber at night that she gave way\r\nto the terrible wofulness that oppressed her, and prayed, and wept, and\r\nwrestled with her sorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd this sweet and lovely creature was the same pious and patient soul\r\nwho was afterwards taunted by rude village boys, and pointed at as one\r\nwho had sold herself to Satan.\r\n\r\nOne night she had cried herself asleep, and lay in an unquiet and fitful\r\nslumber. As she thought of him alway by day, so now in her dreams the\r\nimage of Jason Fletcher was fantastically and singularly busy. It seemed\r\nto her that she stood upon an eminence overlooking a peaceful valley of\r\nthat charming sort only to be seen in dreams. Afar off, and still, in\r\nsome strange way, very near, she beheld the youth of her love, who\r\nreclined upon a bank beside a quiet stream. Everything was at rest. The\r\nsoft moonbeams--for, in her dream, evening rested on the valley--bathed\r\nall the prospect in a cool effulgence. There was no sound, save only\r\nthat sweet music of never-sleeping nature which is forever heard within\r\nall her broad domain. Still the dreamer felt that there was something\r\ndireful and most to be dreaded that threatened to invade and mar the\r\nheavenly peacefulness. She felt it coming, and fearfully awaited its\r\napproach. And she had not long to wait. For presently there appeared,\r\nflying between the calm moonlight and the figure, and casting a doleful\r\nshadow over his form, a scaly and dreadful dragon, like those we read of\r\nthat devastated whole countries in the old, old times. This hideous\r\nbeast breathed fire and smoke from its horrid nostrils as it flew, and\r\nit flapped its fearful way downwards to scorch and destroy the figure\r\nrecumbent by the stream.\r\n\r\nJust when it was stooping upon its unconscious victim, a heavy scale,\r\nbeaten from its side by the bat-like wings, fell upon the night-mare\r\nstricken sleeper's breast, and she awoke.\r\n\r\nThe moon was shining peacefully into the room, and she found upon the\r\nbed a black cat that had leaped in through the low window. It was a\r\ngentle and loving animal, that had made friends with her upon her first\r\narrival, and it had already coiled itself up on the bed with a gentle\r\npurring.\r\n\r\nEverything was most quiet and calm as she lay gazing out through the\r\nwindow; still the dreadful memory of her dream weighed upon and\r\noppressed her. She arose and leaned out into the cool night air. So\r\nleaning, she could see Deacon Fletcher's house, standing bare and brown\r\nin the moonlight only a few rods distant. She could gaze, with what\r\npleasure or sorrow she might, at the windows of the room where poor\r\nJason lay tossing with the fever.\r\n\r\nShe gazes earnestly thitherward, and her breath comes thick and short,\r\nwhile her heart seems rising into her throat. For she sees, gathered\r\nthick and dun above the house, a dense, undulating and ever-increasing\r\nshadow, that threatens to obscure the low-floating moon! There is no\r\nwind, and it rises slowly but steadily! Deacon Fletcher's house is on\r\nfire!\r\n\r\nHer shrill cries, uttered in wild and rapid succession, aroused the\r\nhousehold of Peter Hopkins to the fact that there was fire\r\nsomewhere--fire, that most terrible fiend to awake before in the dead of\r\nnight. As for Hannah, it was but an instant's work for her to throw on a\r\nlittle clothing and spring from the low window into the yard. Then she\r\nran, with what trembling speed she might, towards the burning house.\r\n\r\nThe smoke still rose sombre and heavy from the roof, and about one of\r\nthe chimneys little tongues of flame leaped up as she approached. She\r\ncould hear a fierce crackling, too, of that spiteful sort made by the\r\nburning of dry wood. The house was all of wood, and old, and it was\r\nevidently thoroughly afire within.\r\n\r\nShe realized this as she hurried up to it. In the brief seconds of her\r\ncrossing the field and leaping a small stream that ran near the house,\r\nshe thought of Jason, so noble, so self-denying, so persecuted, so\r\nbeautiful, lying there in his little upper room, powerless from the\r\nfever, and doomed to die a dreadful death. She thought of him, weak and\r\nhelpless, with no strength even to shrink from the flames that should\r\nlap over him and lick him to death with their fiery tongues. All this as\r\nshe sped across the field and leaped the stream.\r\n\r\nReaching the house, she glanced upward, and could perceive the light of\r\nthe flames already showing itself through the upper front windows, next\r\nthe room where slept the Deacon and his wife. Fortunately Jason's room\r\nwas in the rear. Then she remembered that an old nurse from the village\r\nwatched with him, and she called fiercely on her name, but with no\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nAs she had approached the house, the nearest outer door was that facing\r\nthe road, immediately over which the fire was evidently about to break\r\nout, and this door she tried, finding it fast. Then she remembered a\r\nside entrance, through an old wood-shed, that was seldom locked, and she\r\nimmediately made her way to it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fire was busy with the dry wood-work of the house, and\r\nthough there was no wind, it spread with fearful rapidity. Already the\r\nflames had burst out through the roof in two or three places, and in the\r\nfront of the house they were cruelly curling and creeping about the\r\neaves. They seemed confined, however, to the upper portion of the\r\nbuilding, and therein she had hope.\r\n\r\nAs she had anticipated, she found the side door unfastened, and she made\r\nher way rapidly to the foot of the back stairway. When she opened the\r\ndoor to ascend, a thick, black smoke rushed down, almost overpowering\r\nher. The opening of the door seemed to aid the fire, too, and there was\r\na sort of explosive eagerness in the new start it took as it now\r\ncrackled and roared above her. Then she recognized in the sickening\r\nsmoke a smell of burning feathers, and she felt faint and weak as she\r\nthought that it might be _his_ bed that was on fire.\r\n\r\nThis was only for an instant. Staggering backward before the cloud of\r\nsmoke, with outstretched, groping hands, like one suddenly struck blind,\r\nan 'instinct,' or what you please to call it, struck her, and she tore\r\noff her flannel petticoat, wrapping it about her head and shoulders.\r\nThen, holding her hands over mouth and nose, she rushed desperately up\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\nNo one, unless he has been through such a smoke, can conceive of the\r\ntrials she had to undergo in mounting those stairs. No one can fancy,\r\nexcept from the recollection of such an experience, how the fierce heat\r\nbeat her back when she reached the upper hall. The walls were not yet\r\nfully on fire, but great tongues of flame curled along the ceiling, and\r\nhot blasts swept across her path.\r\n\r\nShe knew his room. It was but a step to it, and the door opened easily.\r\nThe nurse was fast asleep, so fast that poor Hannah's warning cry, as\r\nshe stumbled in, hardly aroused her. On the bed lay Jason, so thin, so\r\nwhite, so corpse-like, she would hardly have known him. In the fierce\r\nstrength of her despair it was no task to lift that emaciated body, but,\r\nah! how to get out of the house with it? For when she turned she saw\r\nthat the hall was now wholly on fire.\r\n\r\nBut she did not hesitate. Wrapping him quickly and tenderly in a blanket\r\ntaken from the bed, she rushed out into the flames.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Peter Hopkins and his 'hired man' had been aroused by Hannah's\r\nfirst screams, and had hurriedly scrambled on a portion of their\r\nclothing and rushed out. They had been in time--running quickly across\r\nthe field--to see Hannah disappear behind the house. Neither of them\r\nsupposed for an instant that she had entered it.\r\n\r\nTrying the front door, and finding it fast, Peter uplifted his stout\r\nfoot and kicked it crashing in, but he found it impossible to enter by\r\nthe breach he had made. The front stairway was all in flames, and the\r\nfierce heat drove him hopelessly back. Then they ran around to the rear.\r\nBy this time the entire upper portion of the building seemed to be one\r\nmass of fire and smote, and now they could hear shrill and terrible\r\nshrieks, evidently proceeding from the suddenly awakened inmates. They\r\nran to the kitchen door and burst it in.\r\n\r\nAs they did so there rushed towards them from the foot of the kitchen\r\nstairs some horrible, blazing, and unnatural shape, that came stumbling\r\nbut swiftly forward. With it came smoke and flame and a horrible sound\r\nof stifled moans.\r\n\r\nAt the approach of this strange and unsightly object they sprang back\r\namazed, and it passed them headlong into the open air; passed them and\r\n_dropped apart_, as it were, into the stream before the door.\r\n\r\nFor many years thereafter the slumbers of Farmer Hopkins were disturbed\r\nby visions of what he saw when the two two parts of that terrible\r\napparition were taken from the water.\r\n\r\nThere lay Hannah Lee, no longer beautiful and fresh as the morning, but\r\nblackened, crisped, scorched and shrunken, with all her wealth of silken\r\nhair burned to ashes, with all her clear loveliness of complexion gone\r\nforever. And there lay Jason Fletcher, unburned,--so carefully had she\r\ncovered him as she fled,--but senseless, and to all appearance a corpse.\r\n\r\nThus Hannah Lee went through fire and water, even unto worse than death,\r\nfor the sake of him she loved. And verily she had her reward.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose, there only remained a black and ugly pit to mark the\r\nplace where Deacon Fletcher's house had stood.\r\n\r\nAnd of all its inmates, only Jason--carefully watched and tended at the\r\nhouse of Peter Hopkins--was left to tell the tale of that night's\r\ntragedy. And he, poor fellow, had no tale to tell, the delirium of fever\r\nhaving been upon him all the night. It was very doubtful if he would\r\nrecover,--more than doubtful. Not one in a thousand could do so, with\r\nsuch an exposure at the critical period of his sickness.\r\n\r\nEven more tenderly, with even more anxiety, did all in the country round\r\nminister to poor Hannah Lee. The story of her love, of her bravery, of\r\nher heroic self-abnegation, spread throughout all those parts, and there\r\nwas no end to what was done for her by neighbors and friends. So widely\r\ndid her fame spread, that people from thirty, forty, and even fifty\r\nmiles away came to see her, or sent messages, or money, or delicacies to\r\ncomfort her.\r\n\r\nWhat _could_ be done for them was done, and they both lived.\r\n\r\nWhen Jason Fletcher arose from his sick bed, he arose another man than\r\nthe Jason Fletcher who was thrown down in the arbor by Farmer Hopkins.\r\nHe went sick, a dependent, simple, good-hearted, though impatient boy,\r\nworn out by the constraints of twenty years, but capable of future\r\ncultivation and improvement; he arose from his sickness a moody,\r\ncross-grained, dogged and impatient man, whose only memories were tinged\r\nred with wrong, and made bitter by thought of what he had endured. It\r\nwas little matter to him that all his father's broad acres were now his\r\nown--the thought of the horrible death his parents had died only\r\nsuggested a question in his mind, whether it were not a 'judgment' on\r\nthem: they having lived to persecute him too long already. Through all\r\nthe vista of his past life he saw only gloom and shadows, and no ray of\r\nbrightness cheered the retrospective glance.\r\n\r\nNo ray? Yes, there was one. He saw a fair young girl, loving and\r\ninnocent, whose sweet face scarce ever left his thoughts. She reigned\r\nwhere father and mother held no sway; and she made, with the sunshine of\r\nher love, a clear heaven for him even in the purgatory of the past. So\r\nhe lay, slowly gathering strength, dreaming about her. And presently\r\nthey told him--gently as might be--how she had saved him. And they\r\nnearly killed him in the telling.\r\n\r\nWhen he was well enough to be about, it was strange that they would not\r\nallow him to see her. She was still very ill, they said, and the doctor,\r\na reasonable man enough usually, utterly refused him admission to her\r\nchamber. He fretted at this, and as he gained strength he 'went wrong.'\r\n\r\nMingled with the memory of his old privations was a full assurance of\r\nhis present liberty. He was of age, and he owned, by right, all the\r\nextensive property the Deacon, his father, had so laboriously amassed.\r\nDuring all his boyhood he had never had a shilling, at any one time,\r\nthat he could call his own; now hundreds of pounds stood ready at his\r\nbidding, and he proceeded very speedily to spend them. During all his\r\nboyhood he had been cut off from the amusements common to the youth of\r\nthat day; now he launched out into the most extravagant pleasures his\r\nmoney could procure. Money was nothing, for he had it in plenty;\r\ncharacter was nothing, for he had none to lose; only love remained to\r\nhim of all the good things he might have held, and love lay bleeding\r\nwhile he was denied access to Hannah. Love lay bleeding, and he turned\r\nfor comfort to the wine-cup, and raised Bacchus to the place Cupid\r\nshould have occupied. Alas for Jason Fletcher!\r\n\r\nWeeks rolled on and passed into months, and still he was refused speech\r\nwith, or right of, Hannah. And he chafed at the denial. Had she not\r\nrisked everything to save his life? And he could not even thank her!\r\n\r\nAt length, being unable to find further excuse wherewith to put him off,\r\nthey one day told him he could see his love. They endeavored to prepare\r\nhim by hints and suggestions as to the probable consequences of the\r\ntrial she had passed through, but all that they could say or he imagine\r\nhad not prepared him for the fearful sight.\r\n\r\nPoor Hannah Lee! This scarred, deformed and helpless body, without\r\nproper hands--oh! white hands, how well he remembered them!--without\r\ncomeliness of form or feature, was all that was left of the once\r\nglorious creature, whose heaven-given beauty had ensnared his fresh and\r\nuntutored heart! Poor Hannah Lee!\r\n\r\nThe rough youth, loving her yet, but repelled by the horrible aspect she\r\npresented, fell sobbing upon his knees and buried his face in the\r\nbed-clothing. He spoke no word, but the tumultuous throes of his agony\r\nshook the room as he knelt beside her. And from the bed arose a wail\r\nmore terrible in its utter, eternal sorrowfulness than had ever fallen\r\nupon the ears of those present. It was the wail of a soul recognizing\r\nfor the first time that the loveliness of life had passed away forever.\r\n\r\nThey mingled their cries thus for a little time, and then Jason arose\r\nand staggered from the room. He would have spoken, but the dreadful\r\nsorrow rose up and choked him. All the memories of the past were linked\r\nwith youth and beauty. He could not speak to the blight before him, as\r\nto his love and his life, and so, with blind and lumbering footsteps, he\r\ntoiled heavily from the house.\r\n\r\nThe fires of the Revolution had broken forth and swept over New England,\r\nburning out like stubble the little loyalty to the crown left in men's\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Bunker Hill Jason Fletcher fought like a tiger. Last\r\namong the latest, he clubbed his musket, and was driven slowly backward\r\nfrom the slight redoubt.\r\n\r\nHe was heard of at White Plains, at Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine,\r\nGermantown, and always with marvelous mention of courage and prowess.\r\nThen he was promoted from the ranks, and was mentioned as 'Lieutenant\r\nFletcher.' Then there were rumors of some dishonor that had sullied the\r\nbrightness of his fame; and then it came to be hinted about that in all\r\nthe rank and file of the patriot army there was no one so utterly\r\ndissolute and drunken as he. And then came news of his ignominiously\r\nquitting the service, and a cloud dropped down about him, and no word,\r\ngood or bad, came home from the castaway any more.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile poor Hannah Lee languished upon her bed of suffering, but did\r\nnot die. And finally, when spring after spring had spread new verdure\r\nover the rough hills among which she dwelt, she got, by little and\r\nlittle, to venturing out into the village streets. And when they saw her\r\nbowed form and her ugly, misshapen hands, the village children, knowing\r\nher history, forbore to sneer at or taunt her. All the village loved the\r\nunfortunate creature, and all the village strove together to do her\r\nkindness.\r\n\r\nOne man in the town--a cousin of Jason the wanderer--was supposed to\r\nhold communication with him. This man notified Hannah one day that a\r\nsafe life annuity had been purchased for her, and thereafter she lived\r\nat the house of Farmer Hopkins, not as a loved dependent, but as a\r\ncherished and faithful friend. Thus freed from the bitter sting of\r\nhelpless poverty, Hannah sank resignedly into a quiet and honorable\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAt length, one warm summer day, when Jason Fletcher should have been\r\nabout forty years of age, there strayed into the village a blind\r\nmendicant, with a dog for guide, and a wooden leg rudely fastened to one\r\nstiff stump. This stranger, white-headed and with the care-lines of many\r\nyears on his sadly furrowed face, sought out poor Hannah Lee, and told\r\nher that he had, by the grace of God, come back, at last, to die.\r\nLeading him with gentle counsels to that Mercy Seat where none ever seek\r\nin vain, poor Hannah saw him bend with contrite and humble spirit, and\r\nseek the forgiveness needed to atone for many years of sin. Patient and\r\npenitent he passed a few quiet years, and then she followed to the tomb\r\nthe earthly remains of him for whom she had sacrificed a life.\r\n\r\nAnd this being done, she removed to a distant town, where Martha\r\nHopkins, now kind Mrs. Marjoram, dwelt.\r\n\r\nAnd many years afterwards Mrs. Marjoram told her story, as a lesson that\r\nmen should never judge a living soul by its outward habiliments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFREEDOM'S STARS.\r\n\r\n  From Everglades to Dismal Swamp\r\n    Rose on the hot and trembling air\r\n  Cloud after cloud, in dark array,\r\n    Enfolding from their serpent lair\r\n  The starry flag that guards the free:--\r\n    One after one its stars grew dun,\r\n  Heaven given to shine on Liberty.\r\n\r\n  But swifter than the lightning's gleam\r\n    Flashed out the spears of Northern-light,\r\n  And with the north wind's saving wings,\r\n    The cloud-host, vanquished, took to flight.\r\n  Then in her white-winged radiance there\r\n    The angel Freedom conquering came,\r\n  Relit once more her brilliant stars,\r\n    To burn with an eternal flame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON THE PLAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plains is the current designation of the region stretching westward\r\nfrom Missouri--or rather from the western settlements of Kansas and\r\nNebraska--to the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains. Part of it is\r\nincluded under the vague designation of 'the Great American Desert;' but\r\nthat title is applicable to a far larger area westward than eastward of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. The Great Basin, whereof Salt Lake is the lowest\r\npoint, and the Valley of the Colorado, which skirts it on the east, are\r\nmainly sterile from drouth or other causes--not one acre in each hundred\r\nof their surface being arable without irrigation, and not one in ten\r\ncapable of being made productive by irrigation. Arid, naked, or thinly\r\nshrub-covered mountains traverse and chequer those deep yet elevated\r\nvalleys, wherein few savages or even wild animals of any size or value\r\nwere ever able to find subsistence. Probably that of the Colorado is, as\r\na whole, the most sterile and forbidding of any valley of equal size on\r\nearth, unless it be that of one of the usually frozen rivers in or near\r\nthe Arctic circle. Even Mormon energy, industry, frugality and\r\nsubservience to sacerdotal despotism, barely suffice to wrench a rude,\r\ncoarse living from those narrow belts and patches of less niggard soil\r\nwhich skirt those infrequent lakes and scanty streams of the Great Basin\r\nwhich are susceptible of irrigation; mines alone (and they must be rich\r\nones) can ever render populous the extensive country which is interposed\r\nbetween the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada.\r\n\r\nThe Plains differ radically from their western counterpoise. They have\r\nno mountains, and very few considerable hills; they are not rocky: in\r\nfact, they are rendered all but worthless by their destitution of rock.\r\nIn Kansas, a few ridges, mainly (I believe) of lime, rise to the\r\nsurface; beyond these, and near the west line of the new State,\r\nstretches a thin-soiled, rolling sandstone district, perhaps forty miles\r\nwide; then comes the Buffalo range, formerly covering the entire valley\r\nof the Mississippi, and even stretching fitfully beyond the Rocky\r\nMountains, but now shrunk to a strip hardly more than one hundred and\r\nfifty miles in width, but extending north and south from Texas into the\r\nBritish territory which embosoms the Red River of the North. Better soil\r\nthan that of the Buffalo region west of Kansas is rarely found, though\r\nthe scarcity of wood, and the unfitness of the little that skirts the\r\nlonger and more abiding streams for any use but that of fuel, must be a\r\ngreat drawback to settlement and cultivation. The coarse, short, hearty\r\ngrass that carpets most of this region, and which is allowed to attain\r\nits full growth only in the valleys of the Chugwater and a few other\r\nstreams which have their course mainly within or very near the Rocky\r\nMountains, and which the Buffalo no longer visit, seems worthy at least\r\nof trial by the farmers and shepherds of our older States. Its ability\r\nto resist drouth and overcropping and hard usage generally must be\r\ngreat, and I judge that many lawns and pastures would be improved by it.\r\nThat it has merely held its ground for ages, in defiance of the crushing\r\ntread and close feeding of the enormous herds of the Plains, proves it a\r\nplant of signal hardihood and tenacity of life; while the favor with\r\nwhich it is regarded by passing teams and herds combines with its\r\nevident abundance of nutriment to render its intrinsic value\r\nunquestionable.\r\n\r\nThe green traveler or emigrant in early summer has traversed, since he\r\ncrossed the Missouri, five hundred miles of almost uniformly arable\r\nsoil, most of it richly grassed, with belts of timber skirting its\r\nmoderately copious and not unfrequent water-courses, and he very\r\nnaturally concludes 'the American Desert' a misnomer, or at best a\r\ngross exaggeration. But, from the moment of leaving the Buffaloes behind\r\nhim, the country begins to _shoal_, as a sailor might say, growing\r\nrapidly sterile, treeless, and all but grassless. The scanty forage that\r\nis still visible is confined to the immediate banks or often submerged\r\nintervales of streams, though a little sometimes lingers in hollows or\r\nravines where the drifted snows of winter evidently lay melting slowly\r\ntill late in the spring. By-and-by the streams disappear, or are plainly\r\non the point of vanishing; of living wood there is none, and only\r\nexperienced plainsmen know where to look for the fragments of dead trees\r\nwhich still linger on the banks of a few slender or dried-up brooks,\r\nwhence sweeping fires or other destructive agencies long since\r\neradicated all growing timber. The last living, or, indeed, standing\r\ntree you passed was a stunted, shabby specimen of the unlovely\r\nCotton-wood, rooted in naked sand beside a water-course, and shielded\r\nfrom prairie-fires by the high, precipitous bank; for, scanty as is the\r\nherbage of the desert, the fierce winds which sweep over it will yet,\r\nespecially in late spring or early summer, drive a fire (which has\r\nobtained a start in some fairly grassed vale or nook) through its dead,\r\ntinder-like remains. How far human improvidence and\r\nrecklessness--especially that of our own destructive Caucasian race--has\r\ncontributed to denude the Plains of the little wood that thinly dotted\r\ntheir surface at a period not very remote, I can not pretend to decide;\r\nbut it is very evident that there are far fewer trees now standing than\r\nthere were even one century ago.\r\n\r\nOf rocks rising above or nearing the surface, the Plains are all but\r\ndestitute; hence their eminent lack first of wood, then of moisture.\r\nYour foot will scarcely strike a pebble from Lawrence to Denver; and the\r\nvery few rocky terraces or perpendicular ridges you encounter appear to\r\nbe a concrete of sand and clay, hardened to stone by the persistent,\r\npetrifying action of wind and rain. Of other rock, save the sandstone\r\nridges already noticed, there is none: hence the rivers, though running\r\nswiftly, are never broken by falls; hence the prairie-fires are nowhere\r\narrested by swamps or marshes; hence the forests, if this region was\r\never generally wooded, have been gradually swept away and devoured,\r\nuntil none remain. In fact, from the river bottoms of the lower Kansas\r\nto those of the San Joaquin and Sacramento, there is no swamp, though\r\ntwo or three miry meadows of inconsiderable size, near the South Pass,\r\nknown as 'Ice Springs' and 'Pacific Springs,' are of a somewhat swampy\r\ncharacter. Beside these, there is nothing approximating the natural\r\nmeadows of New England, the fenny, oozy flats of nearly all inhabited\r\ncountries. Bilious fevers find no aliment in the dry, pure breezes of\r\nthis elevated region; but this exemption is dearly bought by the absence\r\nof lakes, of woods, of summer rains, and unfailing streams.\r\n\r\nVast, rarely-trodden forests are wild and lonely: the cit who plunges\r\ninto one, a stranger to its ways, is awed by its gloom, its silence, its\r\nrestricted range of vision, its stifled winds, and its generally\r\nforbidding aspect. He may talk bravely and even blithely to his\r\ncompanions, but his ease and gayety are unnatural: Leatherstocking is at\r\nhome in the forest, but Pelham is not, and can not be. On the better\r\nportion of the Plains--say in the heart of the Buffalo region--it is\r\notherwise: though you are hundreds of miles from a human habitation\r\nother than a rude mail-station tent or ruder Indian lodge, the country\r\nwears a subdued, placid aspect; you rise a gentle slope of two or three\r\nmiles, and look down the opposite incline or 'divide,' and up the\r\ncounterpart of that you have just traversed, seeing nothing but these\r\ngentle, wave-like undulations of the surface to limit your gaze, which\r\ncontemplates at once some fifty to eighty square miles of unfenced,\r\ntreeless, but green and close-cropped pasturage; and it is hard to\r\nrealize that you are out of the pale of civilization, hundreds of miles\r\nfrom a decent dwelling-house, and that the innumerable cattle moving and\r\ngrazing before you--so countless that they seem thickly to cover half\r\nthe district swept by your vision--are not domestic and heritable--the\r\ncollected herds of some great grazing county, impelled from Texas or New\r\nMexico to help subdue some distant Oregon. It seems a sad waste to see\r\nso much good live-stock ranging to no purpose and dying to no profit:\r\nfor the roving, migrating whites who cross the Plains slaughter the\r\nbuffalo in mere wantonness, leaving scores of carcasses to rot where\r\nthey fell, perhaps taking the tongue and the hump for food, but oftener\r\ncontent with mere wanton destruction. The Indian, to whom the buffalo is\r\nfood, clothing, and lodging (for his tent, as well as his few if not\r\nscanty habiliments, is formed of buffalo-skins stretched over\r\nlodge-poles), justly complains of this shameful improvidence and\r\ncruelty. Were _he_ to deal thus with an emigrant's herd, he would be\r\nshot without mercy; why, then, should whites decimate his without\r\nexcuse?\r\n\r\nBeyond the Buffalo region the Plains are bleak, monotonous, and\r\nsolitary. The Antelope, who would be a deer if his legs were shorter and\r\nhis body not so stout, is the redeeming feature of the well-grassed\r\nplains next to Kansas, and which recur under the shadow of the Rocky\r\nMountains; but he is an animal of too much sense to remain in the\r\nscantily grassed desert which separates the buffalo range from the\r\nlatter. There the lean Wolf strolls and hunts and starves; there the\r\npetty Prairie-Wolf, a thoroughly contemptible beast, picks up such a\r\ndirty living as he may; while the sprightly, amusing little Prairie-Dog,\r\nwho is a rather short-legged gray squirrel, with a funny little yelp and\r\na troglodyte habitation, lives in villages or cities of from five\r\nhundred to five thousand dens, each (or most of them) tenanted in common\r\nwith him by a harmless little Owl and a Rattlesnake of questionable\r\namiability. The Owl sits by the mouth of the hole till driven away by\r\nyour approach, when he follows his confrere's example by diving; the\r\nRattlesnake stays usually below, to give any prowling, thieving\r\nprairie-wolf, or other carnivorous intruder, the worst of the bargain,\r\nshould he attempt to dig out the architect of this subterranean abode.\r\nBut for this nice little family arrangement, the last prairie-dog would\r\nlong since have been unearthed and eaten. As it is, the rattlesnake gets\r\na den for nothing, while the prairie-dog sleeps securely under the\r\nguardianship of his poison-tongued confederate. The owl, I presume,\r\neither pays _his_ scot by hunting mice and insects for the general\r\naccount, or by keeping watch against all felonious approaches. Even man\r\ndoes not care to dig out such a nest, and prefers to drown out the\r\ninmates by pouring in pail after pail of water till they have to put in\r\nan appearance above ground. The only defense against this is to\r\nconstruct a prairie-dog town as far as possible from water, and this is\r\ncarefully attended to. I heard on the Plains of one being drowned out by\r\na sudden and overwhelming flood; but of the hundreds I passed, not one\r\nwas located where this seemed possible.\r\n\r\nAbsence of rock in place--that is, of ridges or strata of rock rising\r\nthrough the soil above or nearly to the surface--has determined the\r\ncharacter not only of the Plains but of much of the roll of the great\r\nrivers east and south of them. Even at the very base of the Rocky\r\nMountains, the Chugwater shows a milky though rapid current, while the\r\nNorth Platte brings a considerable amount of earthy sediment from the\r\nheart of that Alpine region. After fairly entering upon the Plains,\r\nevery stream begins to burrow and to wash, growing more and more turbid,\r\nuntil it is lost in 'Big Muddy,' the most opaque and sedimentary of all\r\ngreat rivers. I suspect that all the other rivers of this continent\r\nconvey in the aggregate less earthy matter to the ocean than the\r\nMissouri pours into the previously transparent Mississippi, thenceforth\r\nan unfailing testimony that evil company corrupts and defiles.\r\nLouisiana is the spoil of the Plains, which have in process of time\r\nbeen denuded to an average depth of not less than fifty and perhaps to\r\nthat of two or three hundred feet. I passed hills along the eastern base\r\nof the Rocky Mountains where this process is less complete and more\r\nactive than is usual,--hills which are the remaining vestiges of a\r\nformer average level of the plain adjacent, and which have happened to\r\nwear away so steeply and sharply that very little vegetation ever finds\r\nsupport on their sides, which every rain is still abrading. At a single\r\npoint only do I remember a phenomenon presented by some other mountain\r\nbases,--that of a water-course (dry perhaps half the year, but evidently\r\na heady torrent at times), which had gradually built up a bed and banks\r\nof boulders, pebbles and gravel, washed down from a higher portion of\r\nits headlong course, so that its current, when it had a current, was\r\nconsiderably above the general surface on either side of it. Away from\r\nthe mountains, however, boulders or loose stones of any size are rarely\r\nseen in the beds of even the largest and deepest channeled streams,\r\nwhich are usually swift, but never broken by a fall, because never down\r\nto the subjacent rock in place, assuming that such rock must be.\r\n\r\nIn the rare instances of rocky banks skirting the immediate valley of a\r\nstream, the seeming rock is evidently a modern concrete of clay and the\r\nusual sand or gravel composing the soil,--a concrete slowly formed by\r\nthe action of sun and rain and wind, on a bank left nearly or quite\r\nperpendicular by the wearing action of the stream. In the neighborhood\r\nof Cheyenne Pass,--say for a distance of fifty to a hundred miles S.S.W.\r\nof Laramie,--this effect is exhibited on the grandest scale in repeated\r\ninstances, and in two or three cases for an extent of miles. Along\r\neither bank of the Chugwater, at distances of twenty to forty miles,\r\nabove its junction with the Laramie affluent of the North Platte,\r\nstretch perpendicular rocky terraces, thirty to forty feet high,\r\nlooking, from a moderate distance, as regular and as artificial as the\r\nfaçade of any row of city edifices. I did not see 'Chimney Rock,'\r\nfarther down the Platte; but I presume that this, too, is a relic of\r\nwhat was once the average level of the adjacent country, from which all\r\naround has been gradually washed away, while this 'spared monument' has\r\nbeen hardened by exposure and the action of the elements from earth to\r\nenduring rock--a gigantic natural _adobe_.\r\n\r\nThe Plains attest God's wisdom in usually providing surface-rock in\r\ngenerous abundance as the only reliable conservative force against the\r\ninsidious waste and wear of earth by water. Storms, rills, and rivers\r\nare constantly at work to carry off the soil of every island and\r\ncontinent, and lose it in the depths of seas and oceans. Rock in place\r\nimpedes this tendency, by arresting the headlong course of streams, and\r\ndepositing in their stiller depths the spoils that the current was\r\nhastening away; still more by the formation of swamps and marshes, which\r\narrest the sweep of fires, and so protect the youth and growth of trees\r\nand forests. An uninhabited, moderately-rolling or nearly flat country,\r\nwherein no ridges of stubborn rock gave protection to fire-repelling\r\nmarshes, would gradually be swept of trees by fires, and converted into\r\nprairie or desert.\r\n\r\nLife on the Plains--the life of white men, by courtesy termed\r\ncivilized--is a rough and rugged matter. I can not concur with J.B.\r\nFicklin, long a mail-agent ranging from St. Joseph to Salt Lake (now, I\r\nregret to say, a quarter-master in the rebel army), who holds that a man\r\ngoing on the Plains should never wash his face till he comes off again;\r\nbut water is used there for purposes of ablution with a frugality not\r\nfully justified by its scarcity. A 'biled shirt' lasts a good while. I\r\nnoted some in use which the dry, fine dust of that region must have been\r\nweeks in bringing to the rigidity and clayey yellow or tobacco-stain hue\r\nwhich they unchangeably wore during the days that I enjoyed the society\r\nof the wearers. Pilot-bread, a year or so baked, and ever since\r\nsubjected to the indurating influences of an atmosphere intensely dry,\r\nis not particularly succulent or savory food, and I did not find it\r\nimproved by some minutes' immersion in the frying-pan of hot lard from\r\nwhich our rations of pork had just been turned out; but others of more\r\nexperience liked it much. The pork of the Plains is generally poor,\r\ncomposed of the lightly-salted and half-smoked sides of shotes who had\r\nevidently little personal knowledge of corn. The coffee I did not drink;\r\nbut, in the absence of milk, and often of sugar also, and in view of its\r\nmanufacture by the rudest and rawest of masculine cooks, I judge that\r\nthe temptation to excessive indulgence in this beverage was not\r\nirresistible. Most of the water of the Plains, unlike that of the Great\r\nBasin, is pretty good; but as you near the Rocky Mountains, 'alkali'\r\nbecomes a terror to man and beast.\r\n\r\nThe present Buffalo range will, doubtless, in time, be covered with\r\ncivilized herdsmen and their stock; but beyond that to the fairly\r\nwatered and timbered vicinity of the Rocky Mountains, settlers will be\r\nfew and far between for many generations. What the Plains universally\r\nneed is a plant that defies intense protracted drouth, and will\r\npropagate itself rapidly and widely by the aid of winds and streams\r\nalone. I do not know that the Canada thistle could be made to serve a\r\ngood purpose here, but I suspect it might. Let the plains be well\r\ncovered by some such deep-rooting, drouth-defying plant, and the most of\r\ntheir soil would be gradually arrested, the quality of that which\r\nremains, meliorated, and other plants encouraged and enabled to attain\r\nmaturity under its protection. Shrubs would follow, then trees; until\r\nthe region would become once more, as I doubt not it already has been,\r\nhospitable and inviting to man. At present, I can only commend it as\r\nvery healthful, with a cooling, non-putrefying atmosphere; and, while I\r\nadvise no man to take lodgings under the open sky, still, I say that if\r\none must sleep with the blue arch for his counterpane and the stars for\r\nits embellishments, I know no other region where an out-door roll in a\r\nMackinaw blanket for a night's rest is less perilous or more\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSEVEN DEVILS:\r\n\r\nA REMEMBRANCE OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time--see the Arabian Nights Entertainments--as the Caliph\r\nHaroun Alraschid--blessed be his memory!--walked, disguised, as was his\r\nwont, through the streets of Bagdad, he observed a young man lashing\r\nfuriously a beautiful, snow-white mare to the very verge of cruelty.\r\nComing every day to the same place, and finding the spectacle repeated,\r\nthe curiosity of the humane Caliph, was excited to learn the cause of\r\nsuch treatment. Mr. Rarey had not yet been born; but the Arab knows, and\r\nalways has known, how to subdue and to control his steed with equal\r\nskill, without resort to severity. The explanation of this afterwards\r\nappears in that wonderful book.\r\n\r\nOne Sidi Norman having married, as the custom was, without ever having\r\nseen his bride, was agreeably surprised, when the veil was removed, at\r\nfinding her dazzlingly beautiful. He enfolded her in his arms with joy\r\nunspeakable, and so the honeymoon began. Short dream of bliss; she\r\nbecame capricious at once, and seven devils at least seemed to have\r\nnestled in her lovely bosom. Sid was touchy himself, and not the man to\r\nbear with such humors. Every day she sat at his bountiful board, and,\r\ninstead of partaking the food which he set before her, she would\r\ndaintily and mincingly pick out a few grains of rice with the point of a\r\nbodkin. Sid asked her what she meant by such conduct, and whether his\r\ntable was not well supplied. To this she deigned no reply. When she ate\r\nno rice, she would choke down a few crumbs of bread, not enough for a\r\nsparrow. His indignation was aroused, but his curiosity also. He looked\r\ndaggers; but he was a still man, kept his counsel to himself, and set\r\nhimself to study out the solution of this problem.\r\n\r\nOne night, when his wife stole away from his side,--she thought he was\r\nasleep, did she?--he followed her with the stealthiness of a cat; and,\r\noh horrible! tracked her steps to a graveyard, where she began to cut\r\nand carve; and he then discovered, to his great loathing, that he had\r\nbeen married to a ghoul!\r\n\r\nAmina came home after a good feast. Sid was snoring away, apparently in\r\nthe profound depths of sleep, hiding away from any Caudle lectures. He\r\nwas about as sound asleep as a weasel. Breakfast passed off most\r\ncharmingly without a word said by any one; and he walked round to the\r\nkhan to scrutinize some figs.\r\n\r\n'How does the lady?' said Ben Hadad, sarcastically.\r\n\r\n'Very well indeed, I thank you,' replied Sid.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-bell rang, down they sat, and out came the bodkin. It did\r\nnot, however, 'his quietus make.'\r\n\r\n'My dear,' he said, smothering up his Arabian fury, 'do you not like\r\nthis bill of fare, or does the sight of me take away your taste for\r\nfood? Could you obtain a better meal even at the Bagdad St. Nicholas?'\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n'All well,' said he; 'I suppose that this food is not so toothsome to\r\nyou as dead men's flesh!'\r\n\r\nThunder and furies! A more dreadful domestic scene was never beheld. The\r\nlovely Amina turned black in the face, her eyes bulged out of her head,\r\nshe foamed at the mouth, and, seizing a goblet of water, dashed it into\r\nthe face of the unfortunate man.\r\n\r\n'Take that,' said she, 'and learn to mind your own business.' Whereupon\r\nhe became a dog, and a miserable dog at that.\r\n\r\nMany adventures he then had. For full particulars, see the Arabian\r\nNights. He used to fight for a bone, or lick up a mouthful from a\r\ngutter. He had not the spirit to prick up his ears, or to wag or curl up\r\nhis tail, if he had one--for, shortly after his transformation, the end\r\nof it was wedged into a door by his wife, and he was cur-tailed.\r\n\r\nHappy is he who gets into trouble by necromancy, who can get out of it\r\nby the same. The devil rarely bolts and unbolts his door for his own\r\nguests. He is not wont to say, 'Walk in, my friend,' and afterward,\r\n'Good-by.' But it so turned out in the case of Sid Norman, because he\r\nhad not been knowingly bewitched; and Mrs. Amina Ghoul Sid Norman\r\nlearned to respect the motto, _Cave canem!_\r\n\r\nWhile his canine sufferings lasted, he fell in with various masters, and\r\nnosed about to see if he could substitute reason for instinct, and get\r\nestablished on two legs again. He looked up wistfully into the faces of\r\npassers-by, as if to say, 'I am not a dog, but the man for whom a large\r\nreward has been offered.' On one occasion, seeing Amina come from a shop\r\nwhere she had just purchased a Cashmere shawl of great size and value,\r\nhe set his teeth like a steel trap, and made a grab at her ankles. But\r\nshe recognized him on all fours, with a diabolical grin, and fetching\r\nhim a kick with her little foot, caused him to yelp most pitifully.\r\nRunning under a little cart which stood in the way, he skinned his\r\nteeth, and growled to himself, 'By the prophet, but I can almost love\r\nher again; she distinguished herself by that kick, which was aimed with\r\ninfinite tact; it went right to the spot, and struck me like a\r\ndischarge from a catapult, drove all the wind out of me, and left an\r\nabsolute vacuum, as if a stomach-pump had sucked me out.\r\nYap--yow--eaow--yeaow--yap--snif--xquiz;' and, after a good deal of\r\npanting and distress, he at last yawned so wide as nearly to dislocate\r\nhis jaws, sneezed once or twice, and then trotted off on three legs,\r\nwith his half a tail tucked up underneath, and lay down disconsolate in\r\nan ash-hole.\r\n\r\n'Oh, how distressing it is,' said he, 'to be bewitched by a bad woman!\r\nIt metamorphoses one entirely. He loses all semblance to his former\r\nself, parts with all his reason, no more walks upright, and bids\r\nphilosophy adieu. One drop from the cup of her incantations, and the\r\ngossamer net-work which she threw about him is changed into prisonbars,\r\nher silken chain into links of forged iron; strong will is dwindled, and\r\nhe who on some 'heaven-kissing hill' stood up to gaze upon the stars, is\r\nfit to grovel in a sty.--Miserable dog! Bow-wow, bow-wow!'\r\n\r\nOne day, as the story proceeds, Sid's master was offered a base coin in\r\nhis shop, when this 'learned dog' at once put his foot upon it, and in\r\nfact put his foot in the bargain.\r\n\r\n'Ah, indeed!' said a Bagdad lady, who stood by; 'that's no dog, or, if\r\nhe is, the Caliph ought to have him.' So, snapping her fingers slyly as\r\nshe went out, he followed her.\r\n\r\n'Daughter,' said she to the fair Xarifa, who was working embroidery, 'I\r\nhave brought the baker's famous dog that can distinguish money. There is\r\nsome sorcery about it.--You have once walked on two legs,' said she,\r\nlooking down upon the fawning animal, 'have you not? If so, wag your\r\ntail.'\r\n\r\nSid thumped the floor most furiously with the stump of it, whereupon she\r\npoured liquid into a phial, threw it into his face, and he stood up once\r\nmore a man,--Sid Norman, lost and saved by a woman, his eyes beaming one\r\nmoment with the tenderest gratitude, but on the next flashing with the\r\nmost deadly revenge. Heaven and hell, the one with its joyous sunshine,\r\nthe other with its lurid lights, appeared to struggle and mix up their\r\nflashes on Sid Norman's countenance, till gratitude, that rarest grace,\r\nwas quenched, and hell triumphed.\r\n\r\n'Than all the nectar ever served in golden cups and brewed by houries in\r\nMahomet's paradise, revenge is sweeter,' he murmured to himself.\r\n\r\n'Stay,' said Xarifa, who divined his thoughts; 'you will transform\r\nyourself back again. There will be no transmigration of soul for you, if\r\nyou are lost by your own sorcery. Let dogs delight to bark and bite.'\r\n\r\n'Hold your tongue, Xarifa,' said the mother, who was not so amiable.\r\n'The man shall have revenge. Since he has trotted about so long on all\r\nfours, he must be paid for it. It is not revenge, it is sheer justice.'\r\n\r\n'True as the Koran,' exclaimed Sid Norman, who was becoming infatuate\r\nagain, and would have fallen down at the knees of this new charmer and\r\nworshiped her. The fact is, that he was too easily transformed, and\r\nsubmitted too quickly to the latest magic; otherwise he would have\r\nalways walked erect, instead of wearing fur on his back, and a tail at\r\nthe end of it. A coat of tar and feathers would have been a mere\r\ncircumstance compared with such an indignity. Well, it was the fault,\r\nperhaps it should rather be called the misfortune, of character.\r\n\r\n'Sidi Norman,' said the lady, fixing upon him an amorous glance, 'you\r\nshall not only have revenge, but the richest kind of it. You have a bone\r\nto pick with your wife. She was brought up in the same school of magic\r\nthat I was, hence I hate her. She has the secret of the same rouge, and\r\nconcocts the same potions and love-filters; but she shall smart for it.\r\nExcellent man! injured husband! Monopolize to yourself all the\r\nwhip-cords of Bagdad.'\r\n\r\nSid Norman kneeled and kissed her hand. Xarifa looked up from her\r\nembroidery and frowned.\r\n\r\nThe benefactress withdrew to consult her books, but returned presently.\r\n\r\n'Your wife,' she said, 'has gone out shopping, also to leave some cards,\r\nto fulfil an engagement with the French minister, and to engage a band\r\nof music for an entertainment at which Prince Schearazade is expected to\r\nbe present. Wait patiently for her return, then confront her boldly,\r\nupbraid her, toss this liquor in her eyes, and then you shall see what\r\nyou shall see.'\r\n\r\nSid Norman went to his late home, which was in the West End, the Fifth\r\nAvenue of Bagdad. He opened the door, but silence prevailed. Costly\r\nsilks, and many extravagant and superfluous things, lay strewn about. He\r\nsat down in a rocking-chair and gazed at a full-length portrait of the\r\nHaroun Alraschid.\r\n\r\nAbout noon the lady came in, with six shop clerks after her, bearing\r\npackages, tossed off her head-dress, and flung herself inanimately on\r\nthe sofa.\r\n\r\n'Ahem,' grunted Sid Norman, who was concealed in the shadow of an\r\nalcove.\r\n\r\nAmina looked up. Furies! what an appalling rencontre! She looked as pale\r\nas the corpses which she adored; she would have shrieked, but had no\r\nmore voice than a ghost; she would have fled, but was riveted as with\r\nthe gaze of a basilisk.\r\n\r\n'Dear,' said Sid Norman, with an uxorious smile, 'what ails you? Has the\r\nfast of Kamazan begun? Hardly yet, for this looks more like the\r\ncarnival. How much gave you for this Cashmere, my love?'\r\n\r\nA great sculptor was Sid Norman, for, without lifting a hand, or using\r\nany other tool than a keen eye and a sharp tongue, he had wrought out\r\nbefore him, carved as in cold marble, the statue of a beautiful, bad\r\nwoman. Such is genius. Such is conscience!\r\n\r\n'Mrs. Amina Sidi Ghoul Norman,' proceeded the husband, giving his wife\r\ntime to relax a little from her rigor, 'is dinner ready? We want nothing\r\nbut a little rice. Set on only two plates, a knife and fork for me, and\r\na _bodkin_ for you, if you please, madam.'\r\n\r\n(_A symptom of hysterics, checked by a nightmare inability of action_.)\r\n\r\n'Have you nothing to say? Is thy servant a dog? Why have you wrought\r\nthis deviltry? Take that.'\r\n\r\nTherewith he flung some liquid in her face, and the late fashionable\r\nlady of Bagdad became a mare. Sid seized a cow-skin, and laid on with a\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n'You may now cut up as many capers as you please,' said he, reining her\r\nin with a bit and bridle, and cutting her with the whip until the blood\r\nrolled. 'To-morrow you may go to grass in the graveyard.'\r\n\r\nEvery day he made a practice of lashing her around the square, if\r\npossible, to get the devil out of her. When the Caliph Haroun Alraschid\r\nlearned the true cause of such conduct, he remarked that it was\r\npunishment enough to be transformed into a beast; and, while the stripes\r\nshould be remitted, still he would not have the woman to assume her own\r\nshape again, as she would be a dangerous person in his good city of\r\nBagdad.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moral of this tale of sorcery, which is equal to any in Æsop's\r\nFables, may be drawn from a posthumous letter which was found among the\r\npapers of Sidi Norman, and is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  'TO BEN HADAD, SON OF BEN HADAD.\r\n\r\n'You, who stand upon the verge of youth,--for that is the age, and there\r\nis the realm, of genii, fairies, and wild 'enchantments,--learn wisdom\r\nfrom the said story of Sidi Norman.\r\n\r\n'I was brought up to respect the laws of God and the prophet. When I\r\ncame to marriageable age, and, \"unsight, unseen,\" was induced to espouse\r\nthe veiled Amina, it was, as we say in Bagdad, like \"buying a pig in a\r\npoke,\" although rumor greatly magnified her charms, and a secret\r\ninclination prompted me. I longed eagerly for the wedding-day; and when\r\nher face was revealed to conjugal eyes, methought that Mahomet had sent\r\ndown a houri from his paradise. Yet I found out, to my cost, that a\r\nlittle knowledge of a woman is worse than ignorance, and that the\r\nblinding light of beauty hides the truth more than the thick veil of\r\ndarkness. Oh, her bosom was white as the snows of Lebanon, and her eyes\r\nwere like those of the dear gazelle. Cheeks had she as red as the\r\nDamascus rose, and a halo encircled her like that of the moon. Her\r\nsmiles were sunshine, her lips dropped honey. I thought I saw upon her\r\nshoulders the cropping out of angelic wings. I sought out the carpets of\r\nPersia for the soft touch of her tiny feet, and hired all the lutes of\r\nBagdad to be strung in praise of my beloved. I sent plum-cake to the\r\nnewspapers, and placed a costly fee in the hand of the priest. Oh,\r\nblissful moments! But I purchased hell with them, for she began to lead\r\nme a dog's life. She had no taste for home, no appetite for healthful\r\nfood; she ran me into debt, hated my friends, loved my enemies, and\r\nchanged her soft looks into daggers to stab me with. Her bloom became\r\nblight; her lips oozed out poison, and she dabbled in corrupt things. I\r\ntracked her footsteps from my sacred couch as they led to the very brink\r\nof the grave.\r\n\r\n'O, my son, beware of your partner in the dance of life; for, as Mahomet\r\nused to say, in his jocular moods, 'those who will dance must pay the\r\nfiddler.' To be tied, forever, for better, for worse, to such a ---- as\r\nAmina Ghoul, is to be transformed in one's whole nature. It is the\r\ntransmigration of a soul from amiability to peevishness, from activity\r\nto discouragement, from love to hate, and from high-souled sentiment to\r\nthe dog-kennel of humility. Go thou, and don't do likewise.\r\n\r\n'Woe is me! Who takes one wrong step, gets out of it by another; and so\r\nI went on from enchantment to enchantment, and fell out of the\r\nfrying-pan into the fire. If I stood erect, and no longer groveled, if I\r\nwas not any more a beast, I became like the devils which possessed them.\r\nSo did I scourge and lash the object of my hatred with feelings of the\r\ndeadliest revenge.\r\n\r\n'Oh, my Ben Hadad, presume not from my ultimate escape. If I have ceased\r\nto snap and snarl and growl,--if I now, in the decline of life, pursue\r\nthe even tenor of my way,--if I have been redeemed from snares, and\r\nlearned even to forgive my enemies, it is because the fair Xarifa\r\nrepresented my better nature, and that has triumphed because I took\r\ncounsel of her. Farewell, my son, and, in the pilgrimage of life,\r\nreflect upon the dear-bought experience of SIDI NORMAN.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH US?'\r\n\r\n\r\n  What will we do with you, if God\r\n    Should give you over to our hands,\r\n  To pass in turn beneath the rod,\r\n    And wear at last the captive's bands?'\r\n  'What will we do?' Our very best\r\n    To make of each a glorious State,\r\n  Worthy to match with North and West,--\r\n    Free, vigorous, beautiful and great!\r\n  As God doth live, as Truth is true,\r\n    We swear we'll do all this to you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA late _National Review_ asserts with true English shrewdness that\r\nAmerican literature is yet to be born,--that it has scarcely a\r\nsubstantive existence. 'Its best works,' says this modern Scaliger, 'are\r\nscarcely more than a promise of excellence; the precursors of an advent;\r\nshadows cast before, and, like most shadows, they are too vague and\r\nill-defined, too fluctuating and easily distorted into grotesque forms,\r\nto enable us to discriminate accurately the shape from which they are\r\nflung.... The truth is, that American literature, apart from that of\r\nEngland, has no separate existence.... The United States have yet to\r\nsign their intellectual Declaration of Independence: they are mentally\r\nstill only a province of this country.' With a gallantry too\r\ncharacteristic to be startling, a discernment that does all honor to his\r\ntaste, and a coolness highly creditable to his equatorial regions of\r\ndiscussion, the critic continues by assuring his readers that Washington\r\nIrving was not an American. He admits that by an accident, for which he\r\nis not responsible, this beloved scholar, writer and gentleman claimed\r\nour country as his birthplace, and even, perhaps, had a 'full appetite\r\nto this place of his kindly ingendure,' but informs us he was an\r\nundeniable contemporary of Addison and Steele, a veritable member of the\r\nKit-Cat Club. We may reasonably anticipate that the next investigation\r\nof this penetrative ethnologist may result in the appropriation to us of\r\nthat fossil of nineteenth-century literature, Martin Farquhar Tupper, an\r\nintellectual _quid pro quo_, which will doubtless be received gratefully\r\nby a public already supposed to be lamenting the unexpected loss of its\r\nco-nationality with Irving.\r\n\r\nWhat species of giant the watchful affection of Motherland awaits in a\r\nliterature whose unfledged bantlings are Cooper, Emerson, Holmes, Motley\r\nand Lowell, our imagination does not attempt to depict. We venture,\r\nhowever, to predict that the _National Review_ will not be called upon\r\nto stand sponsor for the bairn, whose advent it so pleasantly announces,\r\nand for whose christening should be erected a cathedral more vast than\r\nSt. Peter's, a temple rarer than that of Baalbec. But while our\r\nsensitive cousin across the water would pin us down to a _credo_ as\r\nabsurd as that of Tertullian, and hedge us in with the adamantine wall\r\nof his own lordly fiat, let us, who fondly hope we have a literature,\r\nwhose principal defect--a defect to which the one infallible remedy is\r\ndaily applied by the winged mower--is youth, inquire into its leading\r\ncharacteristics, seeing if haply we may descry the elements of a golden\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that we are a gloomy people; it is currently\r\nreported that the Hippocrene in which of old the Heliconian muses bathed\r\ntheir soft skins, is now fed only with their tears; that instead of\r\nbranches of luxuriant olive, these maidens, now older grown and wise,\r\npresent to their devout adorers twigs of suggestive birch and thorny\r\nstaves, by whose aid these mournful priests wander gloomily up and down\r\nthe rugged steeps of the past. We have begun to believe that our writers\r\nare afflicted with a sort of myopy that shuts out effectually sky and\r\nstar and sea, and sees only the pebbles and thistles by the dusty\r\nroadside. Truly, the prospect is at first disheartening. The great\r\nByron, who wept in faultless metre, and whose aristocratic maledictions\r\nflow in graceful waves that caress where they mean to stifle, has so\r\npoisoned our 'well of English undefiled,' that wise men now drink from\r\nit warily, and only after repeated filterings and skillful analyses by\r\nthe Boerhaaves of the press. And Poe, who, with all the great poet's\r\nfaults, possessed none of his few genial features, has painted the fatal\r\nskull and cross-bones upon our banners, that should own only the\r\noriflamme. Yet it is Poe whom the English critic honors as exceeding all\r\nour authors in intensity, and approaching more nearly to genius than\r\nthey all.\r\n\r\nNow may St. Loy defend us! At the proposition of Poe's intensity we do\r\nnot demur. All of us who have shrieked in infancy at the charnel-house\r\nnovelettes of imprudent nurses, shivered in childhood at the mysterious\r\nabbeys and concealed tombs of Anne Radcliffe, or rushed in horror from\r\nthe apparition of the dead father of the Archivarius of Hoffman,\r\ntumbling his wicked son down stairs in the midst of the onyx quarrel,\r\nwill willingly and with trembling fidelity bear witness to the intensity\r\nof Poe. He was indeed our Frankenstein (of whom many prototypes do\r\nabound), wandering in the Cimmerian regions of thought, the graveyards\r\nof the mind, and veiling his monstrous creations with the filmy drapery\r\nof rhyme and the mists of a perverted reason. In his sad world eternal\r\nnight reigns and the sun is never seen.\r\n\r\n  'Tristis Erinnys,\r\n  Prætulit infaustas sanguinolenta faces,'\r\n\r\nby whose red light awed audiences see the fruit of his labors.\r\n\r\nBut what right has he to a place in our van, who never asked our\r\nsympathy, whose every effort was but to widen the gulf between him and\r\nhis fellow-man, whose sword was never drawn in defence of the right?\r\nGenius! The very word is instinct with nobility and heartiness. Genius\r\nclasps hands with true souls everywhere: it wakes the chord of\r\nbrotherhood in rude hearts in hovels, and quickens the pulses under the\r\npurple and ermine of palaces. It has a smile for childhood and a\r\nreverent tone for white-haired age. Its clasp takes in the frail flower\r\nbending from slender stems and the stars in their courses. There is\r\nlaughter in its soul, and a huge banquet-table there to which all are\r\nwelcome. And to us, on its borders, come the summer-breath of Pæstum\r\nroses and the aroma of the rich red wine of Valdepeñas; and there toasts\r\nare given to the past and to the future, for genius knows no nation nor\r\nany age. It sparkles along the current of history, and under its warm\r\nsmile deserts blossom like the rose.\r\n\r\nAnd Poe? With a mind neither well balanced nor unprejudiced, and an\r\nimagination that mistook the distorted fantasies of a fevered brain for\r\nthe pure impulses of some mysterious muse, and gave the reins to\r\ncoursers that even Phaeton would have feared to trust, he can only\r\nexcite our pity where he desires our admiration. _Qui non dat quod amat,\r\nnon accipit ille quod optat_, was an inscription on an old chequer-board\r\nof the times of Henry II. And what did Poe love? Truth shrugs her\r\nshoulders, but forbears to answer,--Himself. His were the vagaries of\r\ngenius without its large-hearted charities; its nice discrimination\r\nwithout its honesty of purpose; its startling originality without its\r\nharmonious proportions; its inevitable errors without its persevering\r\nenergies. He acknowledged no principle; he was actuated by no high aim;\r\nhe even busied himself--as so many of the unfortunate great have\r\ndone--with no chimera. From a mind so highly cultured, an organization\r\nso finely strung, we expected the rarest blossoms, the divinest\r\nmelodies. The flowers lie before us, mere buds, from which the green\r\ncalyx of immaturity has not yet curled, and in whose cold heart the\r\nperfume is not born; the melodies vibrate around us, matchless in\r\nmechanism, wondrous in miraculous accord, but as destitute of the _soul_\r\nof harmony as the score of Beethoven's sonata in A flat to unlearned\r\neyes. If his analyses and criticisms are keen and graceful, they are\r\nunreliable and contradictory, for he was often influenced by private\r\npiques, and unpardonable egotism, and the opinions of those whose favor\r\nhe courted. He was Byron without Byron's wonderful perceptions of\r\nnature, Byron's consciousness of the good.\r\n\r\nAnd is it from a genius like this that our literature has taken its\r\ntone? Heaven forbid! Wee Apollos there may be, 'the little Crichtons of\r\nthe hour,' who twist about their brows the cypress sprays that have\r\nfallen from this perverted poet's wreath, and fancy themselves crowned\r\nwith the laurel of a nation's applause. But these men are not types of\r\nour literature. The truly great mind is never molded by the idol of a\r\nday, a clique, a sect. Pure-hearted and strong the man must be whose\r\nhands take hold of the palaces of the world's heart, who grasps the\r\nspirit of the coming time. Errors may be forgiven, vices may be\r\nforgotten, where only a noble aim has influenced, as a true creative\r\ngenius gleamed.\r\n\r\nBut larger constellations have appeared in our literary sky, that burn\r\nwith undimmed lustre even beside that great morning star that rose above\r\nthe horizon of the Middle Ages. Historians we have, with all of\r\nChaucer's truthfulness and luxuriance of expression, and poets with his\r\nfresh tendernesses, his flashing thoughts, and exquisite simplicity of\r\nheart. And perhaps, if we inquire for the distinguishing features of our\r\nliterature, we shall discover them to be the strength and cheerfulness\r\nso pre-eminently the characteristics of Chaucer, which we have so long\r\nbeen accustomed to deny to ourselves. Observe the stately but flowing\r\nperiods of Motley; his polished courtliness of style, the warm but not\r\nexaggerated coloring of his descriptions, the firm but never ungraceful\r\noutlines of his sketches of character that mark him the Michael Angelo\r\namong historians. In his brilliant imagery, his splendid scholarship,\r\nhis fine analytical power, he is not surpassed by Macaulay, while he far\r\nexceeds him in impartiality,--that diamond of the historian,--and in his\r\nkeen comprehension of the great motive-principles of the age which he\r\ndescribes. Neither are Prescott, Bancroft, or Irving inferior to Gibbon,\r\nHume, or Robertson.\r\n\r\nAnd over and through our poetry blow fresh and inspiring the winds from\r\nour own vast prairies. Those names, few, but honorable, that have become\r\nas household words among us, are gilded, not with the doubtful lustre of\r\na moonlit sentimentality, but with the real gold of day-dawn. If they\r\nare few, let it be remembered that we are now but first feeling our\r\nmanhood, trying our thews and sinews, and must needs stop to wonder a\r\nlittle at the gradual development of our unsuspected powers. The most of\r\nour great men have been but stalwart mechanics, busied with the\r\nmachinery of government, using intellect as a lever to raise ponderous\r\nwheels, whereon our chariot may run to Eldorado. We have a right to be\r\nproud of our poets; their verses are the throbs of our American heart.\r\nAnd if we do but peer into their labyrinth of graceful windings and\r\nreach their Chrimhilde Rose-garden, we shall find it begirt with the\r\nstrong, fighting men of humor. This element lurks under many a musical\r\nstrophe and crowns many a regal verse. And yet in real humorous poetry\r\nwe have been sadly deficient. Only of late years have the constant lions\r\nby the gate begun to rouse from their strong slumber, to shake their\r\ntawny manes, and rumble out a warning of their future prowess.\r\n\r\nNor is it strange that we, who were scarcely an organized people, should\r\nhave lacked this great witness to the vitality and stability of a race.\r\nThe features of a national character must be marked and prominent, and a\r\nstrong sense of a national individuality be developed, before that last,\r\nbest faculty of man is aroused, and leaps forth to maturity in verse.\r\nThe one magnificent trait of true humorous poetry is, that in its very\r\nnature it is incapable of trivialities. It must grasp as its key-note\r\nsome vast truth, must grapple with some great injustice, must hurl its\r\nlances at some wide-spread prejudice, or toy with the tangles of some\r\nmighty Nærea's hair. Undines and satyrs, cupids and merry fauns, may\r\nspring laughing from under the artist's hand, but it is from the\r\nunyielding marble that these slender children of his mirthful hours are\r\ncarved. It was not in her infancy that Rome produced her Juvenal.\r\nMartial and Plautus caricatured the passions of humanity after Carthage\r\nhad been destroyed and Julius Cæsar had made of his tomb a city of\r\npalaces. Aristophanes wrote when Greece had her Parthenon and had\r\nboasted her Pericles. France had given birth to Richelieu when Molière\r\nassumed the sack, and England had sustained the Reformation and\r\nconquered the land of the Cid when Butler, with his satires, shaking\r\nchurch and state, appeared before her king. So with America. It was not\r\nuntil wrongs were to be redressed, and unworthy ambitions to be checked,\r\nthat the voice of LOWELL'S scornful laughter was heard in the land,\r\npiercing, with its keen cadences and mirth-provoking rhyme, the policy\r\nof government and the ghostly armor of many a spectral faith and ism.\r\n\r\nTrue, we had the famous 'Hasty Pudding' of Joel Barlow, the 'Terrible\r\nTractoration' of Fessenden, and Halleck's 'Fanny,' but these were mere\r\n_jeux_, gallant little histories, over which we laughed and _voila le\r\ntout!_ And our Astolfo, Holmes, flying by on his winged horse, sends\r\ndown now and then\r\n\r\n  'His arrowes an elle long\r\n  With pecocke well ydight,'\r\n\r\nwhich we gather, and our fair dames weave into brilliant fans that\r\nflutter and snap in many a gay assembly, and whose myriad eyes of blue\r\nand purple smile with irresistible mirthfulness into the most hostile\r\ncountenances. Still Holmes apparently likes best the unrestrained\r\nfreedom of prose. His genius delights in periods finished after its own\r\nheart,--pyramidal, trapezoidian, isoscelesian, rhomboidical. But\r\nLowell's genius is infinitely pliable, accommodating itself without\r\nhesitation to the arbitrary requirements of the Sieur Spondee, and\r\nlaughing in the face of the halting Dactyl. His Birdofredom could, we\r\ndoubt not, sail majestically in the clouds of a stately hexameter, make\r\nthe aristocratic Alexandrine cry for quarter, and excel the old\r\nTrouveurs in the _Rime équivoquée_. From the quiet esteem which his\r\nearly poems and essays had won for him, he leaped at once into the high\r\ntide of popularity, and down its stream\r\n\r\n  'Went sailing with vast celerity,'\r\n\r\nwith the 'Biglow Papers' for his sail. This work electrified the public.\r\nIt pierced the crust of refinement and intelligence, and roused the\r\nlatent laughter of its heart. Even newsboys chuckled with delight over\r\nits caustic hits at the powers that were, against which, with the\r\ncharacteristic precocity of Young America, each had his private\r\nindividual spite; while they found in its peculiar phraseology a mine of\r\nfun. Patriots rejoiced that one vigilant thinker dared stand guard over\r\nour national honor, with the two-edged sword of satire in his hand. Men\r\nin authority, at whom the shafts of its scathing rebukes were leveled,\r\nwrithed on their cushions of state, while, in sheer deference to his\r\noriginality and humor, they laughed with the crowd at--themselves. And\r\nin sooth it was a goodly sight, the young scholar, who had hitherto only\r\ndabbled delicately with the treasures of poetry, whose name was a very\r\nsynonym for elegance and the repose of a genial dignity, whom we\r\nsuspected of no keen outlooks into the practical world of to-day,--to\r\nsee this man suddenly flashing into the dusty arena, with indignation\r\nrustling through his veins and breathing more flame\r\n\r\n  'Than ten fire-kings could swallow,'\r\n\r\nscorching with his burning words, which an inimitable carelessness made\r\ndoubly effective, the willful absurdities of government and the palpable\r\nwrongs of society, to question which had seemed before almost a heresy.\r\nBut Lowell's humor was the chrism, snatching together parallels whose\r\napparent inequalities, yet real justice, were powerfully convincing. He\r\nnever sought the inconsistencies of his subject, they flocked to meet\r\nhim uninvited. And his infinite cheerfulness, his freedom, even in his\r\nmost daring onslaughts, from ill-nature, these were the influences meet,\r\n\r\n  'That bowed our hearts like barley bending.'\r\n\r\nScarcely did we know our knight in his new armor. Off with the hauberk\r\nand visor, down with the glittering shield of his mediæval crusade, and,\r\nlo! with his hand on the plow and his eyes on the fair fields of his own\r\nNew England, our country boy sings his _Ave Aquila!_ while other men are\r\nrubbing the sunbeams of of the new-born day into their sleepy eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not alone in our own country that this newly developed phase\r\nof our poet's genius was acknowledged and applauded. Says a British\r\nReview, with an admiration whose reservations are unfortunately too just\r\nto be disputed: 'All at once we have a batch of small satirists,--Mr.\r\nBailey at their head,--in England, and one really powerful satirist in\r\nAmerica, namely, Mr. J.R. Lowell, whose \"Biglow Papers\" we most gladly\r\nwelcome as being not only the best volume of satires since the\r\nAnti-Jacobin, but also the first work of real and efficient poetical\r\ngenius which has reached us from the United States. We have been under\r\nthe necessity of telling some unpleasant truths about American\r\nliterature from time to time, and it is with hearty pleasure that we are\r\nnow able to own that the Britishers have been for the present utterly\r\nand apparently hopelessly beaten by a Yankee in one important department\r\nof poetry. In the United States, social and political evils have a\r\nbreadth and tangibility which are not at present to be found in the\r\ncondition of any other civilized country. The \"peculiar domestic\r\ninstitution,\" the fillibustering tendencies of the nation, the\r\ncharlatanism which is the price of political power, are butts for the\r\nshafts of the satirist, which European poets may well envy Mr. Lowell.\r\nWe do not pretend to affirm that the evils of European society may not\r\nbe as great in their own way as those which affect the credit of the\r\nUnited States, with the exception, of course, of slavery, which makes\r\nAmerican freedom deservedly the laughing-stock of the world; but what we\r\ndo say is, that the evils in point have a boldness and simplicity which\r\nour more sophisticated follies have not, and that a hundred years hence\r\nMr. Lowell's Yankee satires will be perfectly intelligible to every\r\none.'\r\n\r\nThe predictions of the English reviewer are fulfilled already. The\r\nprescribed century has not elapsed, and in a decade the 'Yankee satires'\r\nare comprehended as perhaps even their author failed to comprehend as he\r\ncreated them. There is something positively startling and uncanny in his\r\nprophetic insight into the passions that have attained their majority in\r\nthis present year of grace,--passions that,\r\n\r\n  'Like aconite, where'er they spread, they kill.'\r\n\r\nHe does not approach with the old show of superstitious reverence the\r\naltar of our vaunted destiny, where men have sung their\r\nin-secula-seculorums, while pagans at the chancel rail have been\r\ndistributing to infidel hordes the relics of their holiest saints, and\r\nthreatening the very fane itself with fire. Mere words will never strike\r\nhim dumb. He does not bow to the shadow of Justice or kneel with the\r\nignorant and unsuspicious at the shrine of every plausible Madonna by\r\nthe roadside. Hear him on the constitutional pillars that heaven and\r\nearth are now moved to keep in place, and let us commiserate what must\r\nnow be the distracting dread of Increse D. O'Phace, Esquire, lest some\r\nSamson in blind revenge entomb himself in the ruins of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n  'Wy, all o' them grand constitootional pillers,\r\n  Our four fathers fetched with 'em over the billers,\r\n  Them pillers the people so soundly hev slept on,\r\n  Wile to slav'ry, invasion an' debt they were swept on,\r\n  Wile our destiny higher an' higher kep mountin'\r\n  (Though I guess folks'll stare wen she hands her account in).\r\n  Ef members in this way go kickin' agin 'em,\r\n  They won't hev so much ez a feather left in em.'\r\n\r\nNot less wonderful than his penetration into political affairs is\r\nLowell's command of the pure Yankee dialect. His knowledge of it is\r\nperfect; he elevates it to the dignity of a distinct tongue, having its\r\nown peculiar etymology, and only adopting the current rules of prosody\r\nin tender consideration for its thousands of English readers. There is,\r\nhowever, we are tolerably assured, a certain class of critics who\r\nventure to lament that this laughter-inspiring muse should have\r\ndescended from the sunny Parnassus of its own vernacular to the meads\r\nbelow, where disport the unlearned and uninspired, the mere kids and\r\nlambs of its celestial audience: a generous absurdity, at which the very\r\nDevil of Delphos might have demurred. These are the dapper gentlemen,\r\nwho, tripping gayly along to the blasts and tinklings of Lanner's\r\nWaltzes, would judge every man's intellect by the measure of their own.\r\nKnow, oh dwarfed descendants of Procustes, that the quality of humor is\r\nnot strained, but droppeth as the gentle dew from heaven; and if, after\r\npatient blending with grains of intolerance and egotism, in the mortar\r\nof your minds, it seems to you but that poisonous foam that of old\r\nsorcerers drew, by their incantations, from the moon, we can only smile\r\nwith Voltaire at your 'foolish ingenuities,' and recommend to you a new\r\ncareer. 'Go pype in an ivy lefe,' Monsieur Mustard-seed, or 'blow the\r\nbukkes' horne.'\r\n\r\nIt is no trifling merit in a work of so extraordinary a character that\r\nthe original programme should have been so perfectly carried out. The\r\npoet never relaxes, even into a Corinthian elegance of allusion; his\r\nmetaphors are always fresh and ungarnished; they no more shine with the\r\npolish of the court than do those of Panurge. In fact, there is a flavor\r\nof the camp about them, a pleasant suspicion, and more than a suspicion,\r\nof life in the open air, the fresh smell of the up-turned earth, the\r\nodor of clover blossoms. The poet is walking in the _fresco_, and the\r\nsharp winds cut a pathway across every page. Equally remarkable and\r\npervaded by a most delightful personality are the editorial lucubrations\r\nof the Rev. Homer Wilbur. The very lustre of the midnight oil shines\r\nupon their glittering fragments of philosophy, admirably twisted to suit\r\nthe requirements of an eminently unphilosophical age; moral axioms from\r\nheathen writers applied judiciously to the immoral actions of Christian\r\ndoers; distorted shadows of a monstrous political economy, and\r\ndispassionate and highly commendable views '_de propagandâ fide_.' Like\r\nJohnson,\r\n\r\n  'He forced Latinisms into his line,\r\n  Like raw undrilled recruits,'\r\n\r\nthat have yet done immense service in his conflicts with the enemy. This\r\npedantry, so inimitable, is unequaled even by the most weighty pages of\r\nthe 'Pseudodoxia Epidemica' of Sir Thomas Browne. That it should prove\r\nobnoxious to some critics only testifies to its perfection and their own\r\nincapacity for enjoyment. If a man does not relish the caviare and\r\ntruffles at a dinner, he does not question the wisdom of his Lucullus in\r\nproviding them; the fault is in his own palate, not in the judgment of\r\nhis host. The aggrieved individuals, who are either too weak or too\r\nindolent to scale the numberless peaks of Lowell's genius, may comfort\r\nthemselves with the reflection that the treasures of their minds will\r\nnever be tesselated into the mosaic of any satirist's fancy, for in them\r\ncan abound only emptiness and cobwebs--as saith the Staphyla of\r\nPlautus:--\r\n\r\n  'Nam hic apud nos nihil est aliud qua sti furibus,\r\n  Ita inaniis sunt oppletæ atque araneis.'\r\n\r\nCaricatures have never been disdained by the greatest minds. They were\r\nrather the healthful diversion of their leisure hours. Even the stern\r\nand rugged-natured artist, Annibale Caracci, was famous for his humorous\r\ninventions, and the good Leonardo da Vinci esteemed them as most useful\r\nexercises. We all remember the group of the Laocoon that Titian sketched\r\nwith apes, and those whole humorous poems in lines found in Herculaneum,\r\nwhere Anchises and Æneas are represented with the heads of apes and\r\npigs. Lessing even tells us in his Laocoon that in Thebes the rage for\r\nthese _caricatura_ was so great that a law was passed forbidding the\r\nproduction of any work conflicting with the severe and absolute laws of\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nIn quite another vein, yet transfused with the same irrepressible mirth,\r\nwe have Lowell's 'Fable for Critics,' which, with its 'preliminary notes\r\nand few candid remarks to the reader,' is a literary curiosity whose\r\nparallel we have not in any work by an American author. It is all one\r\nmerry outburst of youth and health, and music and poetry, with the spice\r\nof a criticism so rare and genial, that one could almost court\r\ndissection at his hands, for the mere exquisitely epicurean bliss of an\r\nartistic euthanasia. It is genius on a frolic, coquetting with all the\r\nGraces, and unearthing men long since become gnomes,\r\n\r\n            'In that country\r\n  Where are neither stars nor meadows,'\r\n\r\nto join in his merry carousing. They float on floods of Chian and moor\r\ntheir barks under 'hills of spice.' What golden wine of inspiration has\r\nour poet drunk, whose flush is on his brow and its fire in his veins?\r\nFor every sentence of this poem is aglow with vigor and life and power;\r\n\r\n  'Its feeldes have een and its woodes have eeres.'\r\n\r\nAnd if he sometimes stumbles over a metre or lets his private\r\nfriendships and preferences run away with his cool discretion and\r\njudgment, why, _bonus dormitat Homerus_, let us, like the miser Euclio,\r\nbe thankful for the good the gods vouchsafe us. Taken in themselves and\r\nwithout regard to their poetical surroundings, no more comprehensive,\r\nfaithful, concise portraitures of our authors have ever been produced.\r\nThey unite in the highest degree candor and justice, and there is withal\r\na tone so kindly and a wit so pure, that we almost believe him to be\r\ndescribing a community of brothers affiliated by the close ties of deep\r\nmutual appreciation. He flings his diamonds of learning upon the page,\r\nand we recognize the scholar whom no extravagance in knowledge can make\r\nbankrupt. We seem to have come by rare chance upon one of those\r\nwardrobes of the early kings, wherein are all savory treasures,--the\r\nrose and violet colored sugars of Alexandria, sweet almonds, and\r\nsharp-toothed ginger. We pardon his puns, indeed we believe them to be\r\ninevitable, the flash of the percussion cap, the sparks of electricity,\r\nSt. Elmo's stars, phosphorescent gleams, playing over the restless ocean\r\nof his fruitful imagination. And we are persuaded that if the venerable\r\nDemocritus (who was uncanonized only because the Holy See was still\r\nwavering, an anomalous body, in _Weissnichtwo_, and who existed forty\r\ndays on the mere sight of bread and honey) had been regaled with the\r\npiquant delicacies of Lowell's picture of a Critic, he might have\r\ncontinued unto this present. It is a satire so pleasantly constructed,\r\nso full of palpable hits at the 'musty dogmas' of the day, so rich in\r\nmirthful allusion, and with such a generously insinuated tribute to the\r\ntrue and earnest-hearted critic, that we know not which most to admire,\r\nthe sketch, or the soul whence it emanated. The following description of\r\na 'regular heavy reviewer' is complete:\r\n\r\n  'And here I must say he wrote excellent articles\r\n  On the Hebraic points, or the force of Greek particles,\r\n  They filled up the space nothing else was prepared for;\r\n  And nobody read that which nobody cared for;\r\n  If any old book reached a fiftieth edition,\r\n  He could fill forty pages with safe erudition;\r\n  He could gauge the old books by the new set of rules,\r\n  And his very old nothings pleased very old fools.\r\n  But give him a new book fresh out of the heart,\r\n  And you put him at sea without compass or chart,--\r\n  His blunders aspired to the rank of an art;\r\n  For his lore was engraft, something foreign that grew in him,\r\n  Exhausting the sap of the native, and true in him,\r\n  So that when a man came with a soul that was new in him,\r\n  Carving new forms of truth out of Nature's old granite,\r\n  New and old at their birth, like Le Verrier's planet,\r\n  Which, to get a true judgment, themselves must create\r\n  In the soul of their critic the measure and weight,\r\n  Being rather themselves a fresh standard of grace,\r\n  To compute their own judge and assign him his place,\r\n  Our reviewer would crawl all about it and round it,\r\n  And reporting each circumstance just as he found it,\r\n  Without the least malice--his record would be\r\n  Profoundly æsthetic as that of a flea,\r\n  Which, supping on Wordsworth, should print, for our sakes,\r\n  Recollections of nights with the Bard of the Lakes,\r\n  Or, borne by an Arab guide, venture to render a\r\n  General view of the ruins of Denderah.'\r\n\r\nHe draws with a few strokes of his magical charcoal a sharp silhouette\r\nof Brownson upon the wall of our waiting curiosity, fills in his sketch\r\nof Parker with a whole wilderness of classical shades, disposes of\r\nWillis with a kiss and a blow, gives pages of sharp pleasantries to\r\nEmerson, pays a graceful tribute to Whittier, and Hawthorne,--\r\n\r\n  'His strength is so tender, his wildness so meek,\r\n  That a suitable parallel sets one to seek,--\r\n  He's a John Bunyan Fouqué, a Puritan Tieck;\r\n  When Nature was shaping him, clay was not granted\r\n  For making so full-sized a man as she wanted,\r\n  So to fill out her model, a little she spared\r\n  From some finer-grained stuff for a woman prepared,\r\n  And she could not have hit a more excellent plan\r\n  For making him fully and perfectly man.'\r\n\r\nTurning backward from these evidences of Lowell's ripening powers to his\r\nearly poems, astonishment at his versatility is the first emotion\r\nproduced. It is hard to believe that the 'Biglow Papers' slid from under\r\nthe hand that wrote the 'Prometheus' and the 'Legend of Brittany.' His\r\ngenius flashes upon us like a certain flamboyant style of poetic\r\narchitecture--the flowing, flame-like curves of his humor blending\r\nhappily with the Gothic cusps of veneration for the old, with quaint\r\nivy-leaves, green and still rustling under the wind and rain, springing\r\neasily out of its severer lines. What resistless magic is there in the\r\nfingers whose touch upon the same rich banks of keys, summons solemn,\r\nvibrant peals as of Beethoven's grandest fugues, endless harmonies as of\r\nthe deep seas, and the light and graceful fantasies of Rossini, which\r\nare as the glad sunshine upon their waves. Truly the poet's gift is a\r\ndivine and an awful one. His heart must needs be proud and humble too,\r\nwho is claimed as nearer of kin than a brother by myriads of stranger\r\nsouls, each, perhaps, owning its separate creed, and in whose unspoken\r\nprayers his name is ever present. In his 'Conversations on some of the\r\nold Poets,' we discover the alembic through which his crude opinions,\r\nhis glowing impulses, his exquisitely minute discrimination were\r\ndistilled;--the old poets, to whom the heart turns ever lovingly as to\r\nthe wide west at eve. They were the nursing mothers of his intellectual\r\ninfancy, and it is probably to his reverent but not blind esteem for\r\nthem, his earnest study of them, not merely as poets, but as men,\r\ncitizens, and friends, that much of the buoyancy and vigor of his poetry\r\nis to be attributed. The 'Conversations' themselves are alive with that\r\nenthusiasm and sympathetic inquiry that disproves the false saying of\r\nthe Parisian Aspasia of Landor--'Poets are soon too old for mutual\r\nlove.' They are the warm photographs of feeling as it bubbles from a\r\nburning heart; sometimes burned over-deep, with a leaning to fanaticism,\r\nbut with so much of the generosity and justice of maturity in their\r\ndecisions that these necessary errors of an ardent youth are overlooked,\r\nand the more as they have disappeared almost entirely from the\r\nproductions of later years. He betrays in his quick conception of an\r\nauthor's mood and meaning a delicacy so extreme, an organization so\r\nnervously alive to beauties and discords, and a religious sentiment so\r\ncultured to the last degree of feeling, that we dread lest we shall\r\nencounter the weakness, morbidness or bigotry that naturally results\r\nfrom the contact of such a soul with the passions of everyday life,\r\nrecalling the oft-quoted '_Medio in fonte leporum_'--\r\n\r\n  'In the bowl where pleasures swim,\r\n  The bitter rises to the brim,\r\n  And roses from the veriest brake\r\n  May press the temples till they ache.'\r\n\r\nBut among the roses of his criticisms we look in vain for thorns. In\r\nstyle, it is true, these essays are halting and unequal. His adoption of\r\nthe colloquial form for the expression of opinion to the public has\r\nnever seemed to us remarkably felicitous, in spite of its venerable\r\nprecedents. Where his imagery becomes lofty and his flow of thought\r\nshould be continuous, we are indignant at its sudden arrest, and\r\ninvoluntarily devote the intruder to a temporary bungalow in Timbuctoo.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to lose the moony Tennysonian sensuousness which\r\ninduced, with Lowell's vigorous imagination, the blank artificiality of\r\nstyle which was visible in several of his early poems. There was a\r\ntendency, too, to the Byzantine liberty of gilding the bronze of our\r\ncommon words, a palpable longing after the _ississimus_ of Latin\r\nadjectives, of whose softness our muscular and variegated language will\r\nnot admit. Mr. Lowell's Sonnets, too, we could wish unwritten, not from\r\nany defect in their construction, but from a fancied want of\r\ncongeniality between their character and his own. In spite of its\r\nItalian origin, the sonnet always seems to demand the severest classical\r\noutlines, both in spirit and expression, calm and steadfastly flowing\r\nwithout ripples or waves, a poem cut in the marble of stately cadences\r\nthat imprison some vast and divine thought. Lowell is too elastic,\r\nimpulsive, for a sonneteer. But considered apart from our peculiar ideas\r\nof the sonnet, the following is full of a very tender beauty:--\r\n\r\n  'I ask not for those thoughts that sudden leap\r\n  From being's sea, like the isle-seeming Kraken,\r\n  With whose great rise the ocean all is shaken,\r\n  And a heart-tremble quivers through the deep;\r\n  Give me that growth which some perchance deem sleep,\r\n  Wherewith the steadfast coral-stems uprise,\r\n  Which by the toil of gathering energies\r\n  Their upward way into clear sunshine keep,\r\n  Until, by Heaven's sweetest influences,\r\n  Slowly and slowly spreads a speck of green\r\n  Into a pleasant island in the seas,\r\n  Where, 'mid tall palms, the cave-roofed home is seen\r\n  And wearied men shall sit at sunset's hour,\r\n  Hearing the leaves and loving God's dear power.'\r\n\r\nAnd what could be more drippingly quaint than his song to 'Violets,'\r\nwhich breathes so gentle and real a sympathy with its subject, that we\r\nalmost imagine it was written in those early times when men communed\r\nwith Nature in her own audible language. It is even more beautiful than\r\nHerrick's\r\n\r\n  'Why do ye weep, sweet babe? Can tears\r\n  Speak grief in you, who were but born\r\n  Just as the modest morn\r\n  Teemed her refreshing dew?'\r\n\r\nWe give but a fragment of the Violet.\r\n\r\n  'Violet! sweet violet!\r\n  Thine eyes are full of tears;\r\n    Are they wet\r\n    Even yet\r\n  With the thought of other years?\r\n  Or with gladness are they full,\r\n  For the night is beautiful,\r\n  And longing for those far-off spheres?\r\n  Thy little heart, that hath with love\r\n  Grown colored, like the sky above\r\n  On which thou lookest ever--\r\n    Can it know\r\n    All the woe\r\n  Of hope for what returneth never,\r\n  All the sorrow and the longing\r\n  To these hearts of ours belonging?'\r\n\r\nAnd there are touches of what we are wont to call dear, womanly feeling,\r\nas when the 'Forlorn,' out in the bitter cold,\r\n\r\n  'Hears a woman's voice within\r\n    Singing sweet words her childhood knew,\r\n  And years of misery and sin\r\n    _Furl off and leave her heaven blue_.'\r\n\r\nThe 'Changeling' alone would sustain a reputation. It seems always like\r\nthe plaintive but sweet warble of some unknown bird rising from the\r\nmidst of tall water-rushes in the day's dim dawning. A wonderful melody\r\nas of Mrs. Browning's best efforts pervades every verse, priceless and\r\nrare as some old intaglio. But when we come to his 'Odes to the Past and\r\nthe Future,' the full power of poesy unfolds before us. Their images are\r\nnot the impalpable spectres of a poet's dream, but symbols hardened into\r\nmarble by his skill, and informed with the fire of life by his genius.\r\n\r\n  'Wondrous and awful are thy silent halls,\r\n    O kingdom of the past!\r\n  There lie the bygone ages in their palls,\r\n    Guarded by shadows vast;\r\n  There all is hushed and breathless,\r\n    Save when some image of old error falls,\r\n  Earth worshiped once as deathless.'\r\n\r\nWas ever picture of silence more effective and complete? We can see the\r\ndesolate quiet of the vast arched halls, left undisturbed by centuries,\r\nand as the moldering statue totters forward from its niche, we feel a\r\nfaith has fallen which was once the heaven of nations, and the awful\r\ntumult is audible as a voice from the drear kingdom of death. And the\r\nhymn to the Future, with all the joyful Titian hues of its opening\r\nstrophes, the glowing fervor of its deep yearning, swelling through\r\n'golden-winged dreams' of the 'Land of Promise':--\r\n\r\n  'To thee the Earth lifts up her fettered hands\r\n    And cries for vengeance; with a pitying smile\r\n  Thou blessest her, and she forgets her bands,\r\n    And her old woe-worn face a little while\r\n  Grows young and noble: unto thee the Oppressor\r\n      Looks and is dumb with awe;\r\n      The eternal law\r\n  Which makes the crime its own blindfold redresser,\r\n  Shadows his heart with perilous foreboding,\r\n      And he can see the grim-eyed Doom\r\n      From out the trembling gloom\r\n  Its silent-footed steeds toward his palace goading.'\r\n\r\nWe pass by the 'Legend of Brittany,' which, as a mere artistic study of\r\nlight and shade in words, is worthy an extended notice. Its fine polish\r\nand refinement of feeling remind us of Spencer's silver verses, frosted\r\nhere and there with the old fret-work of his lovable affectations. But\r\nwe pause at the 'Prometheus,' honestly believing that no poem made up of\r\nso many excellences was ever written in America. Its defects are not of\r\nconception, but in an occasional carelessness of execution--a gasp in\r\nthe rhythm; and when we consider its richness and majesty, when we feel\r\nits resistless grasp upon the heart, we could pardon it if its great\r\npearls were strung on straws or its diamonds hidden in a sand-hill of\r\nsentimentality. But never was poem freer from morbidness: it repels the\r\nsickly pallor of our modern stereotyped sorrow, and is made up only of a\r\ngrief that is regal--more--divine. If any place by its side the\r\nPrometheus of Æschylus and appeal to the unapproachable dignity of their\r\nmodel, we can only say that we hold these two poems distinct as the East\r\nis from the West, only between them springs boldly the blue arch of a\r\nuniversal humanity that suffered and enjoyed as now when the earth was\r\nyoung. But it must not be forgotten that the Greek lived when with men\r\nwas born a boundless sympathy for, and pride in, their gods; that what\r\nare now to us but the wonderful dreams of a primeval poesy, shadowing\r\nmighty truths, were to the ancients living influences that molded their\r\nlives. And if it be urged that already faith must have grown dim in so\r\ngreat a mind as that of Æschylus, then indeed we wonder not at the\r\nmarvels of magnificent despair, the death-in-life of a godlike suffering\r\nwhich reach in his 'Prometheus Chained' a height of sublimity we may\r\nscarcely hope to see approached in modern times, for the mind that\r\ncreated it stood in a light shallop, drifting away from the old\r\nlandmarks of a worn-out creed into the dark, unknown night of doubt and\r\nspeculation. But the Prometheus of Lowell is not the god-man writhing in\r\nan awful conflict with his slavery but begun. His heart\r\n\r\n  'For ages hath been empty of all joy,\r\n  Except to brood upon its silent hope,\r\n  As o'er its hope of day the sky doth now.'\r\n\r\nThe defiant pride and scornful dignity that raised him above our\r\nsympathy in Æschylus, are tempered by Lowell with a human longing for\r\ncomfort that, in its mighty woe, might melt adamant, or draw from the\r\nwatchful heavens\r\n\r\n  'Mild-eyed Astarte, his best comforter,\r\n  With her pale smile of sad benignity.'\r\n\r\nChained to the rock in utter loneliness he lies. Long since the 'crisped\r\nsmiles' of the waves and the 'swift-winged winds' had ceased to listen\r\nto his call.\r\n\r\n  'Year after year will pass away and seem\r\n  To me, in mine eternal agony,\r\n  But as the shadows of dark summer clouds,\r\n  Which I have watched so often darkening o'er\r\n  The vast Sarmatian plain, league-wide at first,\r\n  But, with still swiftness lessening on and on,\r\n  Till cloud and shadow meet and mingle where\r\n  The gray horizon fades into the sky,\r\n  Far, far to northward. Yes, for ages yet\r\n  Must I lie here upon my altar huge,\r\n  A sacrifice for man.'\r\n\r\n'A sacrifice for man.' The theme has won a high significance with time.\r\nOne more passage, and we are done--a passage which rivals Shakspeare in\r\nits startling vividness, as it whispers with awful power close to our\r\nears. All night had the prisoned god heard voices,--\r\n\r\n            'Deeper yet\r\n  The deep, low breathings of the silence grew\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n            And then toward me came\r\n  A shape as of a woman; very pale\r\n  It was, and calm; its cold eyes did not move,\r\n  And mine moved not, but only stared on them.\r\n  Their fixed awe went through my brain like ice;\r\n  A skeleton hand seemed clutching at my heart,\r\n  And a sharp chill, as if a dank night-fog\r\n  Suddenly closed me in, was all I felt.\r\n  And then, methought, I heard a freezing sigh,\r\n  A long, deep, shivering sigh, as from blue lips\r\n  Stiffening in death, close to mine ear. I thought\r\n  Some doom was close upon me, and I looked\r\n  And saw the red morn, through the heavy mist,\r\n  Just setting, and it seemed as it were falling,\r\n  Or reeling to its fall, so dim and dead\r\n  And palsy-struck it looked. Then all sounds merged\r\n  Into the rising surges of the pines,\r\n  Which, leagues below me, clothing the gaunt loins\r\n  Of ancient Caucasus with hairy strength,\r\n  Sent up a murmur in the morning wind,\r\n  Sad as the wail that from the populous earth\r\n  All day and night to high Olympus soars,\r\n  Fit incense to thy wicked throne, O Jove!'\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell is no fine dreamer, no enthusiast in the filmy questions of\r\nsome cloud-land of poetry: the sword of power is in his hand, and the\r\nstern teachings of Right and Justice ring through his heart. To such\r\nmen, Destiny looks for her unfolding. Woe to them, if upon their\r\nsilence, inaction or irresolution in these great days, the steadfast\r\ngaze of her high expectation falls unheeded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRESURGAMUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Go where the sunlight brightly falls,\r\n    Through tangled grass too thick to wave;\r\n  Where silence, save the cricket's calls,\r\n    Reigns o'er a patriot's grave;\r\n  And you shall see Faith's violets spring\r\n  From whence his soul on heavenward wing\r\n    Rose to the realms where heroes dwell:\r\n    Heroes who for their country fell;\r\n    Heroes for whom our bosoms swell;\r\n      Heroes in battle slain.\r\n  God of the just! they are not dead,--\r\n  Those who have erst for freedom bled;--\r\n  Their every deed has boldly said\r\n      We all shall rise again.\r\n\r\n  A patriot's deeds can never die,--\r\n    Time's noblest heritage are they,--\r\n  Though countless æons pass them by,\r\n    They rise at last to day.\r\n  The spirits of our fathers rise\r\n  Triumphant through the starry skies;\r\n    And we may hear their choral song,--\r\n    The firm in faith, the noble throng,--\r\n    It bids us crush a deadly wrong,\r\n      Wrought by red-handed Cain.\r\n  AND WE SHALL CONQUER! for the Right\r\n  Goes onward with resistless might:\r\n  His hand shall win for us the fight.\r\n      WE, too, shall rise again!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMONG THE PINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy last article left the reader in the doorway of the Colonel's mansion.\r\nBefore entering, we will linger there awhile and survey the outside of\r\nthe premises.\r\n\r\nThe house stands where two roads meet, and, unlike most planters'\r\ndwellings, is located in full view of the highway. It is a rambling,\r\ndisjointed structure, thrown together with no regard to architectural\r\nrules, and yet there is a kind of rude harmony in its very\r\nirregularities that has a pleasing effect. The main edifice, with a\r\nfrontage of nearly eighty feet, is only one and a half stories high, and\r\nis overshadowed by a broad projecting roof, which somehow, though in a\r\nvery natural way, drops down at the eaves, and forms the covering of a\r\npiazza, twenty-feet in width, and extending across the entire front of\r\nthe house. At its south-easterly angle, the roof is truncated, and made\r\nagain to form a covering for the piazza, which there extends along a\r\nline of irregular buildings for sixty yards. A portion of the verandah\r\non this side being enclosed, forms a bowling-alley and smoking-room, two\r\nessential appendages to a planter's residence. The whole structure is\r\ncovered with yellow-pine weather boarding, which in some former age was\r\ncovered with paint of a grayish brown color. This, in many places, has\r\npeeled off and allowed the sap to ooze from the pine, leaving every here\r\nand there large blotches on the surface, which somewhat resemble the\r\n'warts' I have seen on the trunks of old trees.\r\n\r\nThe house is encircled by grand, old pines, whose tall, upright stems,\r\nsoaring eighty and ninety feet in the air, make the low hamlet seem\r\nlower by the contrast. They have stood there for centuries, their rough,\r\nshaggy coats buttoned close to their chins, and their long, green locks\r\nwaving in the wind; but man has thrust his long knife into their veins,\r\nand their life-blood is fast oozing away.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the negro huts, which are scattered at irregular\r\nintervals through the woods in the rear of the mansion, there is not a\r\nhuman habitation within an hour's ride; but such a cosey, inviting,\r\nhospitable atmosphere surrounds the whole place, that a stranger does\r\nnot realize he has happened upon it in a wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the dwelling is in keeping with the exterior, though in\r\nthe drawing-rooms, where rich furniture and fine paintings actually\r\nlumber the apartments, there is evident the lack of a nice perception of\r\nthe 'fitness of things,' and over the whole hangs a 'dusty air,' which\r\nreminds one that the Milesian Bridget does not 'flourish' in South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nI was met in the entrance-way by a tall, fine-looking woman, to whom the\r\nColonel introduced me as follows:--\r\n\r\n'Mr. K----, this is Madam ----, my housekeeper; she will try to make you\r\nforget that Mrs. J---- is absent.'\r\n\r\nAfter a few customary courtesies were exchanged, I was shown to a\r\ndressing-room, and with the aid of 'Jim,' a razor, and one of the\r\nColonel's shirts,--all of mine having undergone a drenching,--soon made\r\na tolerably presentable appearance. The negro then conducted me to the\r\nbreakfast-room, where I found the family assembled.\r\n\r\nIt consisted, besides the housekeeper, of a tall, raw-boned,\r\nsandy-haired personage, with a low brow, a blear eye and a sneaking\r\nlook, the Overseer of the plantation; and of a well-mannered,\r\nintelligent lad,--with the peculiarly erect carriage and uncommon\r\nblending of good-natured ease and dignity which distinguished my\r\nhost,--who was introduced to me as the housekeeper's son.\r\n\r\nMadam P----, who presided over the 'tea things,' was a person of perhaps\r\nthirty-five, but a rich olive complexion, enlivened by a delicate\r\nred-tint, and relieved by thick masses of black hair, made her appear to\r\na casual observer several years younger. Her face showed vestiges of\r\ngreat beauty, which time, and, perhaps, care, had mellowed but not\r\nobliterated, while her conversation indicated high cultivation. She had\r\nevidently mingled in refined society in this country and in Europe, and\r\nit was a strange freak of fortune that reduced her to a menial condition\r\nin the family of a backwoods planter.\r\n\r\nAfter some general conversation, the Colonel remarked that his wife and\r\ndaughter would pass the winter in Charleston.\r\n\r\n'And do _you_ remain on the plantation?' I inquired.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes, I am needed here,' he replied; 'but Madam's son is with my\r\nfamily.'\r\n\r\n'Madam's son!' I exclaimed in astonishment, forgetting in my surprise\r\nthat the lady was present.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir,' she remarked, 'my oldest boy is twenty.'\r\n\r\n'Excuse me, Madam; I forgot that in your climate one never grows old.'\r\n\r\n'There you are wrong, sir; I'm sure I _feel_ old when I think how soon\r\nmy boys will be men.'\r\n\r\n'Not old yet, Alice,' said the Colonel, in a singularly familiar tone;\r\n'you seem to me no older than when you were fifteen.'\r\n\r\n'You have been long acquainted,' I remarked, not knowing exactly what to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n'Oh yes,' replied my host, 'we were children together.'\r\n\r\n'Your Southern country, Madam, affords a fine field for young men of\r\nenterprise.'\r\n\r\n'My eldest son resides in Germany,' replied the lady. 'He expects to\r\nmake that country his home. He would have passed his examination at\r\nHeidelberg this autumn had not circumstances called him here.'\r\n\r\n'You are widely separated,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir; his father thinks it best, and I suppose it is. Thomas, here,\r\nis to return with his brother, and I may live to see neither of them\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\nMy curiosity was naturally much excited to learn more, but nothing\r\nfurther being volunteered, and the conversation turning to other topics,\r\nI left the table with it unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nAfter enjoying a quiet hour with the Colonel in the smoking-room, he\r\ninvited me to join him in a ride over the plantation. I gladly assented,\r\nand 'Jim' shortly announced the horses were ready. That darky, who\r\ninvariably attended his master when the latter proceeded from home,\r\naccompanied us. As we were mounting I bethought me of Scip, and asked\r\nJim where he was.\r\n\r\n'He'm gwine to gwo, massa. He want to say good-by to you.'\r\n\r\nIt seemed madness for Scip to start on a journey of seventy miles\r\nwithout rest, so I requested the Colonel to let him remain till the next\r\nday. He cheerfully assented, and sent Jim to find him. While waiting for\r\nthe darky, I spoke of how faithfully he had served me during my journey.\r\n\r\n'He's a splendid nigger,' replied the Colonel; 'worth his weight in\r\ngold. If affairs were more settled I would buy him.'\r\n\r\n'But Colonel A---- tells me he is too intelligent. He objects to\r\n\"knowing\" niggers.'\r\n\r\n'_I_ do not,' replied my host, 'if they are honest, and I would trust\r\nScip with uncounted gold. Look at him,' he continued, as the negro\r\napproached; 'were flesh and bones ever better put together?'\r\n\r\nThe darky _was_ a fine specimen of sable humanity, and I readily\r\nunderstood why the practiced eye of the Colonel appreciated his physical\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\n'Scip,' I said, 'you must not think of going to-day; the Colonel will be\r\nglad to let you remain until you are fully rested.'\r\n\r\n'Tank you, massa, tank you bery much, but de ole man will spec me, and I\r\norter gwo.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, never mind old ----,' said the Colonel, 'I'll take care of him.'\r\n\r\n'Tank you, Cunnel, den I'll stay har till de mornin.'\r\n\r\nTaking a by-path which led through the forest in the rear of the\r\nmansion, we soon reached a small stream, and, following its course for\r\na short distance, came upon a turpentine distillery, which the Colonel\r\nexplained to me was one of three that prepared the product of his\r\nplantation for market, and provided for his family of two hundred souls.\r\n\r\nIt was enclosed, or rather roofed, by a rude structure of rough boards,\r\nopen at the sides, and sustained on a number of pine poles about thirty\r\nfeet in height, and bore a strong resemblance to the usual covering of a\r\nNew England haystack.\r\n\r\nThree stout negro men, divested of all clothing excepting a pair of\r\ncoarse gray trowsers and a red shirt,--it was a raw, cold, wintry\r\nday,--and with cotton bandannas bound about their heads, were 'tending\r\nthe still.' The foreman stood on a raised platform level with its top,\r\nbut as we approached very quietly seated himself on a turpentine barrel\r\nwhich a moment before he had rolled over the mouth of the boiler.\r\nAnother negro was below, feeding the fire with 'light wood,' and a third\r\nwas tending the trough by which the liquid rosin found its way into the\r\nsemi-circle of rough barrels intended for its reception.\r\n\r\n'Hello, Junius, what in creation are you doing there?' asked the\r\nColonel, as we approached, of the negro on the turpentine barrel.\r\n\r\n'Holein' her down, Cunnel; de ole ting got a mine to blow up dis mornin;\r\nI'se got dis barrl up har to hole her down.'\r\n\r\n'Why, you everlasting nigger, if the top leaks you'll be blown to\r\neternity in half a second.'\r\n\r\n'Reckon not, massa; de barrl and me kin hole her. We'll take de risk.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps _you_ will,' said the Colonel, laughing, 'but I won't. Nigger\r\nproperty isn't of much account, but you're too good a darky, June, to be\r\nsent to the devil for a charge of turpentine.'\r\n\r\n'Tank you, massa, but you dun kno' dis ole ting like I do. You cudn't\r\nblow her up nohow; I'se tried her afore dis way.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you do it again; now mind; if you do I'll make a white man of\r\nyou.' (This I suppose referred to a process of flaying with a switch;\r\nthough the switch is generally thought to _redden_, not _whiten_, the\r\ndarky.)\r\n\r\nThe negro did not seem at all alarmed, for he showed his ivories in a\r\nbroad grin as he replied, 'Jess as you say, massa; you'se de boss in dis\r\nshanty.'\r\n\r\nDirecting the fire to be raked out, and the still to stand unused until\r\nit was repaired, the Colonel turned his horse to go, when he observed\r\nthat the third negro was shoeless, and his feet chapped and swollen with\r\nthe cold. 'Jake,' he said, 'where are your shoes?'\r\n\r\n'Wored out, massa.'\r\n\r\n'Worn out! Why haven't you been to me?'\r\n\r\n''Cause, massa, I know'd you'd jaw; you tole me I wears 'em out mighty\r\nfass.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you do, that's a fact; but go to Madam and get a pair; and you,\r\nJune, you've been a decent nigger, you can ask for a dress for Rosey.\r\nHow is little June?'\r\n\r\n'Mighty pore, massa; de ma'am war dar lass night and dis mornin', and\r\nshe reckun'd he's gwine to gwo sartain.'\r\n\r\n'Sorry to hear that,' said the Colonel. I'll go and see him. Don't feel\r\nbadly, June,' he continued, for the tears welled up to the eyes of the\r\nblack man as he spoke of his child; 'we all must die.'\r\n\r\n'I knows dat, massa, but it am hard to hab em gwo.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, it is, June, but we may save him.'\r\n\r\n'Ef you cud, massa! Oh, ef you cud!' and the poor darky covered his face\r\nwith his great hands and sobbed like a child.\r\n\r\nWe rode on to another 'still,' and there dismounting, the Colonel\r\nexplained to me the process of gathering and manufacturing turpentine.\r\nThe trees are 'boxed' and 'tapped' early in the year, while the frost is\r\nstill in the ground. 'Boxing' is the process of scooping a cavity in the\r\ntrunk of the tree by means of a peculiarly shaped axe, made for the\r\npurpose; 'tapping' is scarifying the rind of the wood above the boxes.\r\nThis is never done until the trees have been worked one season, but it\r\nis then repeated year after year, till on many plantations they present\r\nthe marks of twenty and frequently thirty annual 'tappings,' and are\r\noften denuded of bark for a distance of thirty feet from the ground. The\r\nnecessity for this annual tapping arises from the fact that the scar on\r\nthe trunk heals at the end of a season, and the sap will no longer run\r\nfrom it; a fresh wound is therefore made each spring. The sap flows down\r\nthe scarified surface and collects in the boxes, which are emptied six\r\nor eight times in a year, according to the length of the season. This is\r\nthe process of 'dipping,' and it is done with a tin or iron vessel\r\nconstructed to fit the cavity in the tree.\r\n\r\nThe turpentine gathered from the newly boxed or virgin tree is very\r\nvaluable, on account of its producing a peculiarly clear and white\r\nrosin, which is used in the manufacture of the finer kinds of soap, and\r\nby 'Rosin the Bow,' and commands, ordinarily, nearly five times the\r\nprice of the common article. When barreled, the turpentine is frequently\r\nsent to market in its crude state, but more often is distilled on the\r\nplantation, the gatherers generally possessing means sufficient to own a\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nIn the process of distilling, the crude turpentine is 'dumped' into the\r\nboiler through an opening in the top,--the same as that on which we saw\r\nJunius composedly seated,--water is then poured upon it, the aperture\r\nmade tight by screwing down the cover and packing it with clay, a fire\r\nbuilt underneath, and when the heat reaches several hundred degrees\r\nFahrenheit, the process of manufacture begins. The volatile and more\r\nvaluable part of the turpentine, by the action of the heat, rises as\r\nvapor, then condensing flows off through a pipe in the top of the still,\r\nand comes out spirits of turpentine, while the heavier portion finds\r\nvent at a lower aperture, and comes out rosin.\r\n\r\nNo article of commerce is so liable to waste and leakage as turpentine.\r\nThe spirits can only be preserved in tin cans, or in thoroughly seasoned\r\noak barrels, made tight by a coating of glue on the inner side. Though\r\nthe material for these barrels exists at the South in luxuriant\r\nabundance, they are all procured from the North, and the closing of the\r\nSouthern ports has now entirely cut off the supply; for while the\r\nturpentine farmer may improvise coopers, he can by no process give the\r\noak timber the seasoning which is needed to render the barrel\r\nspirit-tight. Hence it is certain that a large portion of the last crop\r\nof turpentine must have gone to waste. When it is remembered that the\r\none State of North Carolina exports annually nearly twenty millions in\r\nvalue of this product, and employs fully three-fourths of its negroes in\r\nits production, it will be seen how dearly the South is paying for the\r\nmad freak of secession. Putting out of view his actual loss of produce,\r\nhow does the turpentine farmer feed and employ his negroes? and, pressed\r\nas these blacks inevitably are by both hunger and idleness, those\r\nprolific breeders of sedition, what will keep them quiet?\r\n\r\n'What effect would secession have on your business?' I asked the\r\nColonel, after a while.\r\n\r\n'A favorable one. I should ship my crop direct to Liverpool and London,\r\ninstead of selling it to New York middlemen.'\r\n\r\n'But is not the larger portion of the turpentine crop consumed at the\r\nNorth?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes. We should have to deal with the Yankees anyhow, but we should\r\ndo as little with them as possible.'\r\n\r\n'Suppose the Yankees object to your setting up by yourselves, and put\r\nyour ports under lock and key?'\r\n\r\n'They won't do that, and if they did England would break the blockade.'\r\n\r\n'We might rap John Bull over the knuckles in that event,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Well, suppose you did, what then?'\r\n\r\n'Merely, England would not have a ship in six months to carry your\r\ncotton. A war with her would ruin the shipping trade of the North. Our\r\nmarine would seek employment at privateering, and soon sweep every\r\nBritish merchant ship from the ocean. We could afford to give up ten\r\nyears' trade with you, and have to put down seccession by force, for the\r\nsake of a year's brush with John Bull.'\r\n\r\n'But, my good friend, where would the British navy be all the while?'\r\n\r\n'Asleep. The English haven't a steamer that can catch a Brookhaven\r\nschooner. The last war proved that vessels of war are no match for\r\nprivateers.'\r\n\r\n'Well, well! but the Yankees won't fight.'\r\n\r\n'Suppose they do. Suppose they shut up your ports, and leave you with\r\nyour cotton and turpentine unsold? You raise scarcely anything\r\nelse--what would you eat?'\r\n\r\n'We would turn our cotton-fields into corn and wheat. Turpentine-makers,\r\nof course, would suffer.'\r\n\r\n'Then why are not _you_ a Union man?'\r\n\r\n'My friend, I have two hundred mouths to feed. I depend on the sale of\r\nmy crop to give them food. If our ports are closed, I can not do\r\nit,--they will starve, and I be ruined. But sooner than submit to the\r\ndomination of the cursed Yankees, I will see my negroes starving and my\r\nchild a beggar.'\r\n\r\nAt this point in the conversation we arrived at the negro shanty where\r\nthe sick child was. Dismounting, the Colonel and I entered.\r\n\r\nThe cabin was almost a counterpart of the 'Mills House,' described in my\r\nprevious paper, but it had a plank flooring, and was scrupulously neat\r\nand clean. The logs were stripped of bark, and whitewashed. A bright,\r\ncheerful fire was blazing on the hearth, and an air of rude comfort\r\npervaded the whole interior. On a low bed in the farther corner of the\r\nroom lay the sick child. He was a boy of about twelve years, and\r\nevidently in the last stages of consumption. By his side, bending over\r\nhim as if to catch his almost inaudible words, sat a tidy,\r\nyouthful-looking colored woman, his mother, and the wife of the negro we\r\nhad met at the 'still.' Playing on the floor, was a younger child,\r\nperhaps five years old, but while the faces of the mother and the sick\r\nlad were of the hue of charcoal, _his_ skin, by a process well\r\nunderstood at the South, had been bleached to a bright yellow.\r\n\r\nThe woman took no notice of our entrance, but the little fellow ran to\r\nthe Colonel and caught hold of the skirts of his coat in a free-and-easy\r\nway, saying, 'Ole massa, you got suffin' for Dickey?'\r\n\r\n'No, you little nig,' replied the Colonel, patting his woolly head as I\r\nmight have done a white child's, 'Dickey isn't a good boy.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, I is,' said the little darky; 'you'se ugly ole massa, to gib\r\nnuffin' to Dickey.'\r\n\r\nAroused by the Colonel's voice, the woman turned towards us. Her eyes\r\nwere swollen and her face bore traces of deep emotion.\r\n\r\n'Oh massa!' she said, 'de chile am dyin'! It'm all along ob his workin'\r\nin de swamp,--no _man_ orter work dar, let alone a chile like dis.'\r\n\r\n'Do you think he is dying, Rosey?' asked the Colonel, approaching the\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\n'Shore, massa, he'm gwine fass. Look at 'em.'\r\n\r\nThe boy had dwindled to a skeleton, and the skin lay on his face in\r\ncrimpled folds, like a mask of black crape. His eyes were fixed, and he\r\nwas evidently going.\r\n\r\n'Don't you know massa, my boy?' said the Colonel, taking his hand\r\ntenderly in his.\r\n\r\nThe child's lips slightly moved, but I could hear no sound. The Colonel\r\nput his ear down to him for a moment, then, turning to me, said,--\r\n\r\n'He _is_ dying. Will you be so good as to step to the house and ask\r\nMadam P---- here, and please tell Jim to go for Junius and the old man.'\r\n\r\nI returned in a short while with the lady, but found the boy's father\r\nand 'the old man'--the darky preacher of the plantation--there before\r\nus. The preacher was a venerable old negro, much bowed by years, and\r\nwith thin wool as white as snow. When we entered he was bending over the\r\ndying boy, but shortly turning to my host, said,--\r\n\r\n'Massa, de blessed Lord am callin' for de chile,--shall we pray?'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel nodded assent, and we all, blacks and whites, knelt down on\r\nthe floor, while the old preacher made a short, heart-touching prayer.\r\nIt was a simple, humble acknowledgment of the dependence of the creature\r\non the Creator,--of His right to give and to take away, and was uttered\r\nin a free, conversational tone, as if long communion with his Maker had\r\nplaced the old negro on a footing of friendly familiarity with Him, and\r\ngiven the black slave the right to talk with the Deity as one man talks\r\nwith another.\r\n\r\nAs we rose from our knees my host said to me, 'It is my duty to stay\r\nhere, but I will not detain you. Jim will show you over the plantation.\r\nI will join you at the house when this is over.' The scene was a painful\r\none, and I gladly availed myself of the Colonel's suggestion.\r\n\r\nMounting our horses, Jim and I rode off to the negro house where Scip\r\nwas staying.\r\n\r\nScip was not at the cabin, and the old negro woman told us he had been\r\naway for several hours.\r\n\r\n'Reckon he'll be 'way all day, sar,' said Jim, as we turned our horses\r\nto go.\r\n\r\n'He ought to be resting against the ride of to-morrow. Where has he\r\ngone?'\r\n\r\n'Dunno, sar, but reckon he'm gwine to fine Sam.'\r\n\r\n'Sam? Oh, he's the runaway the Colonel has advertised.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, sar, he'm 'way now more'n a monfh.'\r\n\r\n'How can Scip find him?'\r\n\r\n'Dunno, sar. Scipio know most ebery ting,--reckon he'll track him. He\r\nknow him well, and Sam'll cum back ef he say he orter.'\r\n\r\n'Where do you think Sam is?'\r\n\r\n'P'raps in the swamp.'\r\n\r\n'Where is the swamp?'\r\n\r\n''Bout ten mile from har.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes! the shingles are cut there. I should think a runaway would be\r\ndiscovered where so many men are at work.'\r\n\r\n'No, massa, dar'm places dar whar de ole debil cudn't fine him, nor de\r\ndogs nudder.'\r\n\r\n'I thought the bloodhounds would track a man anywhere.'\r\n\r\n'Not t'ru de water, massa; dey lose de scent in de swamp.'\r\n\r\n'But how can a negro live there,--how get food?'\r\n\r\n'De darkies work dar and dey take 'em nuff.'\r\n\r\n'Then the other negroes often know where the runaways are; don't they\r\nsometimes betray them?'\r\n\r\n'Neber, massa; a darky neber tells on anoder. De Cunnel had a boy in dat\r\nswamp once, good many years.'\r\n\r\n'Is it possible? Did he come back?'\r\n\r\n'No, he died dar. Sum ob de hands found him dead one mornin' in de hut\r\nwhar he lib'd, and dey buried him dar.'\r\n\r\n'Why did Sam run away?'\r\n\r\n''Cause de Oberseer flog him. He use him bery hard, massa.'\r\n\r\n'What had Sam done?'\r\n\r\n'Nuffin', massa.'\r\n\r\n'Then why was he flogged? Did the Colonel know it?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yas; Moye cum de possum ober de Cunnel, and make him b'lieve Sam\r\nwar bad. De Cunnel dunno de hull ob dat story.'\r\n\r\n'Why didn't _you_ tell him? The Colonel trusts you.'\r\n\r\n'Twudn't hab dun no good; de Cunnel wud hab flogged _me_ for tellin' on\r\na wite man. Nigga's word ain't ob no account.'\r\n\r\n'What is the story about Sam?'\r\n\r\n'You won't tell dat _I_ tole you, massa?'\r\n\r\n'No, but I'll tell the Colonel the truth.'\r\n\r\n'Wal den, sar, you see Sam's wife am bery good-lookin', her skin's most\r\nwite,--her mudder war a mulatter, her fader a wite man,--she lub'd Sam\r\n'bout as well as de wimmin ginrally lub dar husbands,' (Jim was a\r\nbachelor, and his observation of plantation morals had given him but\r\nlittle faith in the sex), 'but most ob 'em, ef dey'm married or no, tink\r\ndey must smile on de wite men, so Jule she smiled on de Oberseer,--so\r\nSam tought,--and it made him bery jealous. He war sort o' sassy, and de\r\nOberseer strung him up and flog him bery hard. Den Sam took to de swamp,\r\nbut he didn't know whar to gwo, and de dogs tracked him; he'd ha' got\r\n'way dough ef de Oberseer hadn't shot him; den he cudn't run. Den Moye\r\nflogged him till he war 'most dead, and arter dat chained him up in de\r\nole cabin and gabe him 'most nuffin' to eat. De Cunnel war gwine to take\r\nSam to Charles'on and sell him, but sumhow he got a file and sawed fru\r\nde chain and got 'way in de night to de 'still.' When de Oberseer cum\r\ndar in de mornin', Sam jump on him and 'most kill him. He'd hab sent him\r\nwhar dar ain't no niggas ef Junius hadn't a holed him. _I'd_ a let de\r\nole debil gwo.'\r\n\r\n'Junius, then, is a friend of the Overseer.'\r\n\r\n'No, sar; _he_ hain't no friends, 'cep de debil; but June am a good\r\nnigga, and he said 'twarn't right to kill ole Moye so sudden, for den\r\ndar'd be no chance for de Lord forgibin' him.'\r\n\r\n'Then Sam got away again?'\r\n\r\n'O yas; nary one but darkies war round, and dey wouldn't hole him. Ef\r\ndey'd cotched him den, dey'd hung him, shore.'\r\n\r\n'Why hung him?'\r\n\r\n''Cause he'd struck a wite man; it 'm shore death to do dat.'\r\n\r\n'Do you think Scip will bring him back?'\r\n\r\n'Yas; 'cause he 'm gwine to tell massa de hull story. De Cunnel will\r\nb'lieve Scipio ef he _am_ brack. Sam'll know dat, and he'll come back.\r\nDe Cunnel'll make de State too hot to hole ole Moye, when he fine him\r\nout.'\r\n\r\n'Does Sam's wife \"smile\" on the Overseer now?'\r\n\r\n'No; she see de trubble she bring on Sam, and she bery sorry. She won't\r\nlook at a wite man now.'\r\n\r\nDuring the conversation above recorded, we had ridden for several miles\r\nover the western half of the plantation, and were then again near the\r\nhouse. My limbs being decidedly stiff and sore from the effects of the\r\nprevious day's journey, I decided to alight and rest at the house until\r\nthe hour for dinner.\r\n\r\nI mentioned my jaded condition to Jim, who said,--\r\n\r\n'Dat's right, massa; come in de house. I'll cure de rumatics; I knows\r\nhow to fix dem.'\r\n\r\nFastening the horses at the door, Jim accompanied me to my\r\nsleeping-room, where he lighted a pile of pine knots, and in a moment\r\nthe fire blazed up on the hearth and sent a cheerful glow through the\r\napartment; then, saying he would return after stabling the horses, the\r\ndarky left me.\r\n\r\nI took off my boots, drew the sofa near the fire, and stretched myself\r\nat full length upon it. If ever mortal was tired, 'I reckon' I was. It\r\nseemed as if every joint and bone in my body had lost the power of\r\nmotion, and sharp, acute pains danced along my nerves, as I have seen\r\nlightning play along the telegraph wires. My entire system had the\r\ntoothache.\r\n\r\nJim soon returned, bearing in one hand a decanter of 'Otard,' and in the\r\nother a mug of hot water and a crash towel.\r\n\r\n'I'se got de stuff dat'll fix de rumatics, massa.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, Jim; a glass will do me good. Where did you get it?' I\r\nasked, thinking it strange the Colonel should leave his brandy-bottle\r\nwithin reach of the darkies, who have an universal weakness for spirits.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I keeps de keys; de Cunnel hisself hab to come to me wen he want\r\nsuffin' to warm hisself.'\r\n\r\nIt was the fact; Jim had exclusive charge of the wine-cellar; in short,\r\nwas butler, barber, porter, footman, and body-servant, all combined.\r\n\r\n'Now, massa, you lay right whar you is, and I'll make you ober new in\r\nless dan no time.'\r\n\r\nAnd he did; but I emptied the brandy-bottle. Lest my temperance friends\r\nshould be horror-stricken, I will mention, however, that I took the\r\nfluid by external absorption. For all rheumatic sufferers, I would\r\nprescribe, hot brandy in plentiful doses, a coarse towel, and an active\r\nSouthern darky, and if on the first application the patient is not\r\ncured, the fault will not be the nigger's. Out of mercy to the\r\nchivalry, I hope our government, in saving the Union, will not\r\nannihilate the order of body-servants. They are the only perfect\r\ninstitution in the Southern country, and, so far as I have seen, about\r\nthe only one worth saving.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-bell sounded a short while after Jim had finished the\r\nscrubbing operation, and I went to the table with an appetite I had not\r\nfelt for a week. My whole system seemed rejuvenated, and I am not sure\r\nthat I should, at that moment, have declined a wrestling match with\r\nHeenan himself.\r\n\r\nI found at dinner only the Overseer and the young son of Madam P----,\r\nthe Colonel and the lady being still at the cabin of the dying boy. The\r\ndinner, though a queer mixture of viands, would not have disgraced,\r\nexcept, perhaps, in the cooking, the best of our Northern hotels.\r\nVenison, bacon, wild fowl, hominy, poultry, corn-bread, French\r\n'made-dishes,' and Southern 'common doin's,' with wines and brandies of\r\nthe choicest brands, were placed on the table together.\r\n\r\n'Dis, massa,' said Jim, 'am de raal juice; it hab ben in de cellar eber\r\nsince de house war built. Massa tole me to gib you some, wid him\r\ncomplimen's.'\r\n\r\nPassing it to my companions, we drank the Colonel's health in as fine\r\nwine as I ever tasted.\r\n\r\nI had taken an instinctive dislike to the Overseer at the\r\nbreakfast-table, and my aversion was not lessened by learning his\r\ntreatment of Sam; curiosity to learn what manner of man he was, however,\r\nled me, towards the close of our meal, to 'draw him out,' as follows:--\r\n\r\n'What is the political sentiment, sir, of this section of the State?'\r\n\r\n'Wal, I reckon most of the folks 'bout har' is Union; they're from the\r\n\"old North,\" and gin'rally pore trash.'\r\n\r\n'I have heard that the majority of the turpentine getters are\r\nenterprising men and good citizens,--more enterprising, even, than the\r\ncotton and rice planters.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, they is enterprisin', 'cause they don't keer for nuthin' 'cep'\r\nmoney.'\r\n\r\n'The man who is absorbed in money-getting is generally a quiet citizen.'\r\n\r\n'P'raps that's so. But I think a man sh'u'd hev a soul suthin' 'bove\r\ndollars. Them folks will take any sort o' sarce from the Yankees, ef\r\nthey only buy thar truck.'\r\n\r\n'What do you suffer from the Yankees?'\r\n\r\n'Suffer from the Yankees? Don't they steal our niggers, and hain't they\r\n'lected an ab'lishener for President?'\r\n\r\n'I've been at the North lately, but I am not aware that is so.'\r\n\r\n'So! it's damnably so, sir. I knows it. We don't mean to stand it eny\r\nlonger.'\r\n\r\n'What will you do?'\r\n\r\n'We'll secede, and then give 'em h--l, ef they want it!'\r\n\r\n'Will it not be necessary to agree among yourselves before you do that?\r\nI met a turpentine farmer below here who openly declared that he is\r\nfriendly to abolishing slavery. He thinks the masters can make more\r\nmoney by hiring than by owning the negroes.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, that's the talk of them North County[A] fellers, who've squatted\r\nround har. We'll hang every mother's son on 'em, by G----.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The 'North Counties' are the north-eastern portion of North\r\nCarolina, and include the towns of Washington and Newberne. They are an\r\nold turpentine region, and the trees are nearly exhausted. The finer\r\nvirgin forests of South Carolina, and other cotton States, have tempted\r\nmany of these farmers to emigrate thither, within the past ten years,\r\nand they now own nearly all the trees that are worked in South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, and Florida. They generally have few slaves of their own, their\r\nhands being hired of wealthier men in their native districts. The\r\n'hiring' is an annual operation, and is done at Christmas time, when the\r\nnegroes are frequently allowed to go home. They treat the darkies well,\r\ngive them an allowance of meat (salt pork or beef), as much corn as they\r\ncan eat, and a gill of whisky daily. No class of men at the South are so\r\nindustrious, energetic, and enterprising. Though not so well informed,\r\nthey have many of the traits of our New England farmers; in fact, are\r\nfrequently called 'North Carolina Yankees.' It was these people the\r\nOverseer proposed to hang. The reader will doubtless think that 'hanging\r\nwas not good enough for them.']\r\n\r\n'I wouldn't do that: in a free country every man has a right to his\r\nopinions.'\r\n\r\n'Not to sech opinions as them. A man may think, but he mustn't think\r\nonraasonable.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know, but it seems to me reasonable, that if the negroes cost\r\nthese farmers now one hundred and fifty dollars a year, and they could\r\nhire them, if free, for a hundred, that they would make by abolition.'\r\n\r\n'Ab'lish'n! By G----, sir, ye ain't an ab'lishener, is ye?' exclaimed\r\nthe fellow, in an excited tone, bringing his hand down on the table in a\r\nway that set the crockery a-dancing.\r\n\r\n'Come, come, my friend,' I replied, in a mild tone, and as unruffled as\r\na basin of water that has been out of a December night; 'you'll knock\r\noff the dinner things, and I'm not quite through.'\r\n\r\n'Wal, sir, I've heerd yer from the North, and I'd like to know if yer an\r\nab'lishener.'\r\n\r\n'My dear sir, you surprise me. You certainly can't expect a modest man\r\nlike me to speak of himself.'\r\n\r\n'Ye can speak of what ye d---- please, but ye can't talk ab'lish'n har,\r\nby G----,' he said, again applying his hand to the table, till the\r\nplates and saucers jumped up, performed several jigs, then several\r\nreels, and then rolled over in graceful somersaults to the floor.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, the Colonel and Madam P---- entered.\r\n\r\nObserving the fall in his crockery, and the general confusion of things,\r\nthe Colonel quietly asked, 'What's to pay?'\r\n\r\nI said nothing, but burst into a fit of laughter at the awkward fix the\r\nOverseer was in. That gentleman also said nothing, but looked as if he\r\nwould like to find vent through a rat-hole or a window-pane. Jim,\r\nhowever, who stood at the back of my chair, gave _his_ eloquent thoughts\r\nutterance, very much as follows:--\r\n\r\n'Moye hab 'sulted Massa K----, Cunnel, awful bad. He hab swore a blue\r\nstreak at him, and called him a d---- ab'lishener, jess 'cause Massa\r\nK---- wudn't get mad and sass him back. He hab disgrace your hosspital,\r\nCunnel, wuss dan a nigga.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel turned white with rage, and, striding up to the Overseer,\r\nseized him by the throat, yelling, rather than speaking, these words:\r\n'You d---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----, have you dared to insult a\r\nguest in my house?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't mean to 'sult him,' faltered out the Overseer, his voice\r\nrunning through an entire octave, and changing with the varying pressure\r\nof the Colonel's fingers on his throat; 'but he said he war an\r\nab'lishener.'\r\n\r\n'No matter what he said,' replied the Colonel; 'he is my guest, and in\r\nmy house he shall say what he pleases, by G----. Apologize to him, or\r\nI'll send you to h---- in a second.'\r\n\r\nThe fellow turned cringingly to me, and ground out something like this,\r\nevery word seeming to give him the toothache:--\r\n\r\n'I meant no offence, sar; I hope ye'll excuse me.'\r\n\r\nThis satisfied me, but, before I could make a reply, the Colonel again\r\nseized him by the throat, and yelled,--\r\n\r\n'None of your sulkiness; get on your knees, you d---- white-livered\r\nhound, and ask the gentleman's pardon like a man.'\r\n\r\nThe fellow then fell on his knees, and got out, with less effort than\r\nbefore,--\r\n\r\n'I 'umbly ax yer pardon, sar, very 'umbly, indeed.'\r\n\r\n'I am satisfied, sir,' I replied. 'I bear you no ill-will.'\r\n\r\n'Now go,' said the Colonel; 'and in future, take your meals in the\r\nkitchen. I have none but gentlemen at my table.'\r\n\r\nThe fellow went. As soon as he had closed the door, the Colonel said to\r\nme,--\r\n\r\n'Now, my dear friend, I hope you will pardon _me_ for this occurrence. I\r\nsincerely regret you have been insulted in my house.'\r\n\r\n'Don't speak of it, my dear sir; the fellow is ignorant, and really\r\nthinks I am an abolitionist. It was his zeal in politics that led to his\r\nwarmth. I blame him very little,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'But he lied, Massa K----,' chimed in Jim, very warmly; 'you neber said\r\nyou war an ab'lishener.'\r\n\r\n'You know what _they_ are, don't you, Jim?' said the Colonel, laughing,\r\nand taking no notice of Jim's breach of decorum in wedging his black\r\nideas into a white conversation.\r\n\r\n'Yas, I does dat,' said the darky, grinning.\r\n\r\n'Jim,' said the Colonel, 'you're a prince of a nigger, but you talk too\r\nmuch; ask me for something to-day, and I reckon you'll get it; but go\r\nnow, and tell Chloe (the cook) to get us some dinner.'\r\n\r\nThe darky left, and, excusing myself, I soon followed suit.\r\n\r\nI went to my room, laid down on the lounge, and soon fell asleep. It was\r\nnearly five o'clock when a slight noise in the apartment awoke me, and,\r\nlooking up, I saw the Colonel quietly seated by the fire, smoking a\r\ncigar. His feet were elevated above his head, and he appeared absorbed\r\nin no very pleasant reflections.\r\n\r\n'How is the sick boy, Colonel?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'It's all over with him, my friend. He died easy; but 'twas very painful\r\nto me, for I feel I have done him wrong.'\r\n\r\n'How so?'\r\n\r\n'I was away all summer, and that cursed Moye sent him to the swamp to\r\ntote for the shinglers. It killed him.'\r\n\r\n'Then you are not to blame,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'I wish I could feel so.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel remained with me till supper-time, evidently much depressed\r\nby the events of the morning, which had affected him more than I could\r\nhave conceived possible. I endeavored, by cheerful conversation, and by\r\ndirecting his mind to other topics, to cheer him, and in a measure\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nWhile we were seated at the supper-table, the black cook entered from\r\nthe kitchen,--a one-story shanty, detached from and in the rear of the\r\nhouse,--and, with a face expressive of every conceivable emotion a negro\r\ncan feel,--joy, sorrow, wonder, and fear all combined,--exclaimed, 'O\r\nmassa, massa! dear massa! Sam, O Sam!'\r\n\r\n'Sam,' said the Colonel; 'what about Sam?'\r\n\r\n'Why, he hab--dear, dear massa, don't yer, don't yer hurt him--he hab\r\ncome back!'\r\n\r\nIf a bombshell had fallen in the room, a greater sensation could not\r\nhave been produced. Every individual arose from the table, and the\r\nColonel, striding up and down the apartment, exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n'Is he mad? The everlasting fool! Why in h---- has he come back?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, don't ye hurt him, massa,' said the black cook, wringing her hands.\r\n'Sam hab ben bad, bery bad, but he won't be so no more.'\r\n\r\n'Stop your noise, aunty,' said the Colonel, but with no harshness in his\r\ntone. 'I shall do what I think right.'\r\n\r\n'Send for him, David,' said Madam P----; 'let us hear what he has to\r\nsay. He would not come back if he meant to be ugly.'\r\n\r\n'_Send_ for him, Alice!' replied my host. 'He's prouder than Lucifer,\r\nand would send me word to come to _him_. I will go. Will you accompany\r\nme, Mr. K----? You'll hear what a runaway nigger thinks of slavery: Sam\r\nhas the gift of speech, and uses it regardless of persons.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir, I'll go with pleasure.'\r\n\r\nSupper being over, we went. It was about an hour after nightfall when we\r\nemerged from the door of the mansion and took our way to the negro\r\nquarters. The full moon had risen half way above the horizon, and the\r\ndark pines cast their shadows around the little collection of negro\r\nhuts, which straggled about through the woods for the distance of a\r\nthird of a mile. It was dark, but I could distinguish the figure of a\r\nman striding along at a rapid pace a few hundred yards in advance of us.\r\n\r\n'Isn't that Moye?' I asked the Colonel, directing his attention to the\r\nreceding figure.\r\n\r\n'I reckon so; that's his gait. He's had a lesson to-day that'll do him\r\ngood.'\r\n\r\n'I don't like that man's looks,' I replied, carelessly; 'but I've heard\r\nof singed cats.'\r\n\r\n'He _is_ a sneaking d----l,' said the Colonel; 'but he's very valuable\r\nto me. I never had an overseer who got so much work out of the hands.'\r\n\r\n'Is he cruel to them?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I reckon he is; but a nigger is like a dog,--you must flog him to\r\nmake him like you.'\r\n\r\n'I judge your niggers haven't been flogged into liking Moye,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Why, have you heard any of them speak of him?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; though, of course, I've made no effort to draw gossip from them. I\r\nhad to hear.'\r\n\r\n'O yes; I know; there's no end to their gabble; niggers will talk. But\r\nwhat have you heard?'\r\n\r\n'That Moye is to blame in this affair of Sam, and that you don't know\r\nthe whole story.'\r\n\r\n'What _is_ the whole story?' asked the Colonel, stopping short in the\r\nroad; 'tell me before I see Sam.'\r\n\r\nI then told him what Jim had recounted to me. He heard me through\r\nattentively, then laughingly exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n'Is that all! Lord bless you; he didn't seduce her. There's no seducing\r\nthese women; with them it's a thing of course. It was Sam's d---- high\r\nblood that made the trouble. His father was the proudest man in\r\nVirginia, and Sam is as like him as a nigger can be like a white man.'\r\n\r\n'No matter what the blood is, it seems to me such an injury justifies\r\nrevenge.'\r\n\r\n'Pshaw, my good fellow, you don't know these people. I'll stake my\r\nplantation against a glass of whisky there's not a virtuous woman with a\r\ndrop of black blood in her veins in all South Carolina. They prefer the\r\nwhite men; their husbands know it, and take it as a matter of course.'\r\n\r\nWe had here reached the negro cabin. It was one of the more remote of\r\nthe collection, and stood deep in the woods, an enormous pine growing up\r\ndirectly beside the doorway. In all respects it was like the other huts\r\non the plantation. A bright fire lit up its interior, and through the\r\ncrevices in the logs we saw, as we approached, a scene that made us\r\npause involuntarily, when within a few rods of the house. The mulatto\r\nman, whose clothes were torn and smeared with swamp mud, stood near the\r\nfire. On a small pine table near him lay a large carving-knife, which\r\nglittered in the blaze, as if recently sharpened. His wife was seated on\r\nthe side of the low bed at his back, weeping. She was two or three\r\nshades lighter than the man, and had the peculiar brown, kinky hair,\r\nstraight, flat nose, and speckled, gray eyes which mark the metif.\r\nTottling on the floor at the feet of the man, and caressing his knees,\r\nwas a child of perhaps two years.\r\n\r\nAs we neared the house, we heard the voice of the Overseer issuing from\r\nthe doorway on the other side of the pine-tree.\r\n\r\n'Come out, ye black rascal.'\r\n\r\n'Come in, you wite hound, ef you dar,' responded the negro, laying his\r\nhand on the carving-knife.\r\n\r\n'Come out, I till ye; I sha'n't ax ye agin.'\r\n\r\n'I'll hab nuffin' to do wid you. G'way and send your massa har,' replied\r\nthe mulatto man, turning his face away with a lordly, contemptuous\r\ngesture, that spoke him a true descendant of Pocahontas. This movement\r\nexposed his left side to the doorway, outside of which, hidden from us\r\nby the tree, stood the Overseer.\r\n\r\n'Come away, Moye,' said the Colonel, advancing with me toward the door;\r\n'_I'll_ speak to him.'\r\n\r\nBefore all of the words had escaped the Colonel's lips, a streak of fire\r\nflashed from where the Overseer stood, and took the direction of the\r\nnegro. One long, wild shriek,--one quick, convulsive bound in the\r\nair,--and Sam fell lifeless to the floor, the dark life-stream pouring\r\nfrom his side. The little child also fell with him, and its\r\ngreasy-grayish shirt was dyed with its father's blood. Moye, at the\r\ndistance of ten feet, had discharged the two barrels of a\r\nheavily-loaded shot-gun directly through the negro's heart.\r\n\r\n'You incarnate son of h----,' yelled the Colonel, as he sprang on the\r\nOverseer, bore him to the ground, and wrenched the shot-gun from his\r\nhand. Clubbing the weapon, he raised it to brain him. The movement\r\noccupied but a second; the gun was descending, and in another instant\r\nMoye would have met Sam in eternity, had not a brawny arm caught the\r\nColonel's, and, winding itself around his body, pinned his limbs to his\r\nside so that motion was impossible. The woman, half frantic with\r\nexcitement, thrust open the door when her husband fell, and the light\r\nwhich came through it revealed the face of the new-comer. But his voice,\r\nwhich rang out on the night air as clear as a bugle, had there been no\r\nlight, would have betrayed him. It was Scip. Spurning the prostrate\r\nOverseer with his foot, he shouted,--\r\n\r\n'Run, you wite debil, run for your life!'\r\n\r\n'Let me go, you black scoundrel,' shrieked the Colonel, wild with rage.\r\n\r\n'When he'm out ob reach, you'd kill him,' replied the negro, as cool as\r\nif he was doing an ordinary thing.\r\n\r\n'I'll kill you, you black ---- hound, if you don't let me go,' again\r\nscreamed the Colonel, struggling violently in the negro's grasp, and\r\nliterally foaming at the mouth.\r\n\r\n'I shan't lef you gwo, Cunnel, till you 'gree not to do dat.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was a stout, athletic man, in the very prime of life, and\r\nhis rage gave him more than his ordinary strength, but Scip held him as\r\nI might have held a child.\r\n\r\n'Here, Jim,' shouted the Colonel to his body-servant, who just then\r\nemerged from among the trees, 'rouse the plantation--shoot this d----\r\nnigger.'\r\n\r\n'Dar ain't one on 'em wud touch him, massa. He'd send _me_ to de hot\r\nplace wid one fist.'\r\n\r\n'You ungrateful dog,' groaned his master. 'Mr. K----, will you stand by\r\nand see me handcuffed by a miserable slave?'\r\n\r\n'The black means well, my friend; he has saved you from murder. Say he\r\nis safe, and I'll answer for his being away in an hour.'\r\n\r\nThe Colonel made one more ineffectual attempt to free himself from the\r\nvice-like grip of the negro, then relaxed his efforts, and, gathering\r\nhis broken breath, said, 'You're safe _now_, but if you're found within\r\nten miles of my plantation by sunrise, by G---- you're a dead man.'\r\n\r\nThe negro relinquished his hold, and, without saying a word, walked\r\nslowly away.\r\n\r\n'Jim, you d---- rascal,' said the Colonel to that courageous darky, who\r\nwas skulking off, 'raise every nigger on the plantation, catch Moye, or\r\nI'll flog you within an inch of your life.'\r\n\r\n'I'll do dat, Cunnel; I'll kotch de ole debil, ef he's dis side de hot\r\nplace.'\r\n\r\nHis words were echoed by about twenty other darkies, who, attracted by\r\nthe noise of the fracas, had gathered within a safe distance of the\r\ncabin. They went off with Jim, to raise the other plantation hands, and\r\ninaugurate the hunt.\r\n\r\n'If that d---- nigger hadn't held me, I'd had Moye in h---- by this\r\ntime,' said the Colonel to me, still livid with excitement.\r\n\r\n'The law will deal with him. The negro has saved you from murder, my\r\nfriend.'\r\n\r\n'The law be d----; it's too good for such a -- hound; and that the d----\r\nnigger should have dared to hold me,--by G----, he'll rue it.'\r\n\r\nHe then turned, exhausted with the recent struggle, and, with a weak,\r\nuncertain step, entered the cabin. Kneeling down by the dead body of the\r\nnegro, he attempted to raise it; but his strength was gone. Motioning to\r\nme to aid him, we placed the corpse on the bed. Tearing open the\r\nclothing, we wiped away the still flowing blood, and saw the terrible\r\nwound which had sent the negro to his account. It was sickening to look\r\non, and I turned to go.\r\n\r\nThe negro woman, who was weeping and wringing her hands, now approached\r\nthe bed, and, in a voice nearly choked with sobs, said,--\r\n\r\n'Massa, oh massa, I done it! it's me dat killed him!'\r\n\r\n'I know you did, you d---- ----. Get out of my sight.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, massa,' sobbed the woman, falling on her knees, 'I'se so sorry; oh,\r\nforgib me!'\r\n\r\n'Go to ----, you ---- ----, that's the place for you,' said the Colonel,\r\nstriking the kneeling woman with his foot, and felling her to the floor.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to see or hear more, I left the master with the slave. A\r\nquarter of a mile through the woods brought me to the cabin of the old\r\nnegress where Scip lodged. I rapped at the door, and was admitted by the\r\nold woman. Scip, nearly asleep, was lying on a pile of blankets in the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n'Are you mad?' I said to him. 'The Colonel is frantic with rage, and\r\nswears he will kill you. You must be off at once.'\r\n\r\n'No, no, massa; neber fear; I knows him. He'd keep his word, ef he loss\r\nhis life by it. I'm gwine afore sunrise; till den I'm safe.'\r\n\r\nOf the remainder of that night, more hereafter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. SEWARD'S PUBLISHED DIPLOMACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the executive capacity and marked forensic versatility of William\r\nHenry Seward whilst Governor and Senator of the Empire State, the great\r\npublic have long been familiar. That public are now for the first time\r\npractically discussing his diplomatic statesmanship. A world of\r\nspectators or auditors witness or listen to the debate, and are eager to\r\npronounce favorable judgment, because so much of national honor is now\r\nentrusted to him. Our national history discloses no crisis of domestic\r\nor foreign affairs so momentous as the present one. The most remarkable\r\nchapter in that history will be made up from the complications of this\r\ncrisis, and from the disasters to or the successes of our national fame.\r\nHence to himself and to his friends, more than to the watchful public\r\neven, Mr. Seward's course attracts an interest which may attend upon the\r\nvery climacteric excellence of his statesman-career during a\r\nquarter-century.\r\n\r\nMuch, that remains obscure or is merely speculative when these pages at\r\nthe holiday season undergo magazine preparation, will have been unfolded\r\nor explained at the hour in which they may be read. The national\r\nfirmament, which at the Christmas season displayed the star of war and\r\nnot of peace, may at midwinter display the raging comet; or that star of\r\nwar may have had a speedy setting, to the mutual joy of two nations who\r\nonly one year ago played the role of Host and Guest, whilst the young\r\nroyal son of one government rendered peaceful homage at the tomb of the\r\noldest Father of the other nation.\r\n\r\nHence, it is not the province of this paper to indulge in speculations\r\nregarding the future of Mr. Seward's diplomacy;--only to collect a few\r\nfacts and critical suggestions respecting the diplomatic labors of\r\nSecretary Seward since his accession to honor, with some interesting\r\nreferences to our British complications which have passed under his\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the enlightenment of the somewhat prejudiced audience\r\nwho listen to our American discussion, there appeared simultaneously\r\nwith the publications of British prints the governmental volume of\r\npapers relating to foreign affairs which usually accompanies a\r\nPresident's Message. It is not commonly printed for many months after\r\nreception by Congress. But the sagacity of Mr. Seward caused its\r\ntypographical preparation in advance of presidential use. It therefore\r\nbecomes an antidote to the heated poison of the Palmerston or Derby\r\nprints, which emulate in seizing the last national outrage for party\r\npurposes. And its inspection enables the great public, after perusing\r\nwhat Secretary Seward has written during the past troublous half year,\r\nto acquire a calm reliance upon his skill in navigating our glorious\r\nship of state over the more troublous waters of the next half year.\r\n\r\nThe most cursory inspection of this volume must put to shame those\r\nWashington news-mongers, who from March to December pictured the\r\nSecretary as locked up in his office, in order to merely shun\r\noffice-seekers, or as idling his time at reviews and sham-fights. The\r\ncollection demonstrates, that his logic, persuasion, and rhetorical\r\nexcellence have in diplomatic composition maintained their previous\r\nexcellences in other public utterances; and that his physical capacity\r\nfor labor, and his mental sympathy with any post of duty, have been as\r\neffective, surrounded by the dogs of war, as they were when tasked amid\r\nthe peaceful herds of men. The maxim, _inter arma silent leges_, is\r\nsuspended by the edicts of diplomacy!\r\n\r\nMr. Seward entered the State Department March the fifth (according to\r\nreliable Washington gossip), before breakfast, and was instantly at\r\nwork. He found upon his table, with the ink scarcely dry, the draft of a\r\n(February 28th) circular from his predecessor, Mr. Black (now U.S.\r\nSupreme Court reporter), addressed to all the ministers of the United\r\nStates. That circular very briefly recited the leading facts of the\r\ndisunion movement, and instructed the ministers to employ all means to\r\nprevent a recognition of the confederate States. The document in\r\nquestion is dated at the very time when President Lincoln was perfecting\r\nhis inaugural; and why its imperative and necessary commands were\r\ndelayed until that late hour, is something for Mr. Buchanan to explain\r\nin that volume of memoirs which he is said to be preparing at the\r\nfalling House of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nFrom the dates of Mr. Seward's circulars, it is evident that he devoted\r\nsmall time to official 'house-warming' or 'cleaning up.' Some time, no\r\ndoubt, was passed in consulting the indexes to the foreign affairs of\r\nthe past eventful four months, and in making himself master of the\r\nsituation. His first act is to transmit to all the (Buchanan)\r\nsubordinates abroad copies of the President's Message, accompanying it\r\nwith a score of terse and sparkling paragraphs regarding the rebellion;\r\nyet, in those few paragraphs, demonstrating the illusory and ephemeral\r\nadvantages which foreign nations would derive from any connection they\r\nmight form with any 'dissatisfied or discontented portion, State, or\r\nsection of the Union.' In this connection, he refers to the\r\n'governments' of J. Davis, Esq., as 'those States of this Union in whose\r\nname a provisional government has been _announced_;'--which is the\r\nhappiest description yet in print.\r\n\r\nThere is apparently a fortnight's interregnum, during which a procession\r\nof would-be consuls and ministers marches from the State Department to\r\nthe Senate chamber to receive the _accolade_ of diplomacy. The Minister\r\nto Prussia, Mr. Judd, first finds gazette, and on March 22d the\r\nSecretary prepares for him instructions suitable to the crisis. There\r\nare 'stars' affixed to the published extracts, showing _coetera desunt_,\r\nmatters of _secret_ moment perchance! And here we may fitly remark, that\r\nwhilst the labors of the diplomatist which came before the public for\r\ninspection display his industry, it is certain that quite as voluminous,\r\nperhaps more, must be the unpublished and secret dispatches. 'The note\r\nwhich thanked Prince Gortchacow through M. De Stoeckl was reprehensibly\r\nbrief,' the leading gazettes said; _but are they sure nothing else was\r\nprepared and transmitted, of which the public must remain uncertain?_\r\nAre they ready to assert that Russia has become a convert to an _open_\r\ndiplomacy? Or does she still feel most complimented with ciphers and\r\nmystery?\r\n\r\nSo early as the date of the Judd dispatch, the text of the Lincoln\r\nadministration appears. 'Owing to the very peculiar structure of our\r\nfederal government, and the equally singular character and habits of the\r\nAmerican people, this government _not only wisely, but necessarily,\r\nhesitates to resort to coercion and compulsion to secure a return of the\r\ndisaffected portion of the people to their customary allegiance_. The\r\nUnion was formed upon popular consent, and must always practically stand\r\non the same basis. The temporary causes of alienation must pass away;\r\n_there must needs be disasters and disappointments resulting from the\r\nexercise of unlawful authority by the revolutionists_, while happily it\r\nis certain that there is a general and profound sentiment of loyalty\r\npervading the public mind throughout the United States. While it is the\r\nintention of the President to maintain the sovereignty and rightful\r\nauthority of the Union everywhere, with firmness as well as discretion,\r\nhe at the same time relies with great confidence on the salutary working\r\nof the agencies I have mentioned to restore the harmony and union of the\r\nStates. But to this end, it is of the greatest importance that the\r\ndisaffected States shall not succeed in obtaining favor or recognition\r\nfrom foreign nations.'\r\n\r\nTwo months prior to this, and on the Senate floor, Mr. Seward had said,\r\n'taking care always that speaking goes before voting, voting goes before\r\ngiving money, and all go before a battle, which I should regard as\r\nhazardous and dangerous; and therefore the last, as it would be the most\r\npainful measure to be resorted to for the salvation of the Union.'\r\n\r\nA day or two succeeding the Judd dispatch, Mr. Seward writes for\r\nMinister Sanford (about to leave for Belgium) instructions; commingling\r\nviews upon non-recognition with considerations respecting tariff\r\nmodifications. In these appears a sentence kindred to those just\r\nquoted--'_The President, confident of the ultimate ascendency of law,\r\norder, and the Union, through the deliberate action of the people in\r\nconstitutional forms_,' etc.\r\n\r\nFrom those diplomatic suggestions, which are accordant with _European_\r\nexigencies, Mr. Seward readily turns his attention to Mexican affairs,\r\nin a carefully considered and most ably written letter of instructions\r\nfor Minister Corwin. He touches upon the robberies and murder of\r\ncitizens, the violation of contracts, and then gracefully withdraws them\r\nfrom immediate attention until the incoming Mexican administration shall\r\nhave had time to cement its authority and reduce the yet disturbed\r\nelements of their society to order and harmony. He avers that the\r\nPresident not only forbids discussion of our difficulties among the\r\nforeign powers, but will not allow his ministers '_to invoke even\r\ncensure against those of our fellow-citizens who have arrayed themselves\r\nin opposition to authority_.' He refers to the foreshadowed protectorate\r\nin language complimentary to Mexico, yet firm in assurance that the\r\nPresident neither has, nor can ever have, any sympathy with\r\nrevolutionary designs for Mexico, _in whatever quarter they may arise,\r\nor whatever character they may take on_.'\r\n\r\nWithin one week (and at dates which contradict the prevailing gossip of\r\nlast April, that Messrs. Adams, Dayton, Burlingame, Schurz and Co. were\r\ndetained _awaiting_ Mr. Seward's advices) still more elaborate and\r\nmasterly instructions are given out to these gentlemen. The paper to Mr.\r\nAdams will in future years be quoted and referred to as a model history\r\nof the rise and progress of the secession enormity. It may be asked, Why\r\nare such dispatches and instructions needed? Why such elaborate briefs\r\nand compendiums required for gentlemen each of whom may have said,\r\nrespecting his connection with subject-matter of the Secretary (none\r\nmore emphatically so than Messrs. Adams and Burlingame), _quorum pars\r\nmagna fui?_ Yet, it must be remembered that diplomacy, like\r\njurisprudence (with its red tape common to both), taketh few things for\r\ngranted, and constantly maketh records for itself, under the maxim _de\r\nnon apparentibus non existentibus eadem est ratio_; and ever beareth in\r\nmind that when _certioraris_ to international tribunals are served, the\r\ninitiatory expositions and the matured results must not be subjected to\r\na pretence of diminution, but be full and complete.\r\n\r\nThe early dispatch for Mr. Burlingame contains the caustic sentence,\r\n'Our representatives at Vienna seem generally to have come, after a\r\nshort residence there, to the conclusion that there was nothing for them\r\nto do, and little for them to learn.' But 'the President expects that\r\n_you_ will be diligent in obtaining not only information about political\r\nevents, but also commercial and even scientific facts, and in reporting\r\nthem to this department.'\r\n\r\nAlthough the Austrian mantle was soon transferred to the classic\r\nshoulders of Mr. Motley,--another honored Bay-state-ian,--the caustic\r\nreference to predecessors, and the implied compliment of request, did\r\nnot at all lose their respective significance.\r\n\r\nWhat a compact statement is contained in the following sentence of the\r\ninstructions to the representative of foreign affairs at Vienna!--'The\r\npolitical affairs in Austria present to us the aspect of an ancient and\r\nvery influential power, oppressed with fiscal embarrassments,--the\r\nlegacy of long and exhausting wars,--putting forth at one and at the\r\nsame time efforts for material improvement and still mightier ones to\r\nprotect its imperfectly combined dominion from dismemberment and\r\ndisintegration, seriously menaced from without, aided by strong and\r\nintense popular passions within.' A lyceum lecturer might consume an\r\nevening over the present political condition of Austria, and yet not\r\nconvey a more perfect idea thereof than is comprehended by the preceding\r\nparagraph!\r\n\r\nMr. Seward in first addressing Mr. Dayton discusses the slavery element\r\nof the rebellion, and elucidates more particularly the relations of\r\nFrance to a preserved or a dismembered Union; and evolves this plucky\r\nsentence: 'The President neither expects nor desires any intervention,\r\n_or even any favor_, from the government of France, or any other, in\r\nthis emergency.' But a still more spirited paragraph answers a question\r\noften asked by the great public, 'What will be the course of the\r\nadministration should foreign intervention be given?' Foreign\r\nintervention _would oblige us_ to treat those who should yield it as\r\nallies of the insurrectionary party, and to carry on the war against\r\nthem as enemies. The case would not be relieved, but, on the contrary,\r\nwould only be aggravated, if _several_ European states should combine in\r\nthat intervention. _The President and the people of the United States\r\ndeem the Union which would then be at stake, worth all the cost and all\r\nthe sacrifices of a contest with the world in arms, if such a contest\r\nshould prove inevitable_.'\r\n\r\nIn the advices to Mr. Schurz, at Madrid, occurs a most ingenious\r\napplication of the doctrine of secession to Spanish consideration in\r\nrespect to Cuba and Castile; to Aragon and the Philippine Islands; as\r\nwell as a most opportune reference to the proffered commercial\r\nconfederate advantages. 'What commerce,' asks the Secretary, 'can there\r\nbe between states whose staples are substantially identical? Sugar can\r\nnot be exchanged for sugar, nor cotton for cotton.' And another sentence\r\nis deserving remembrance for its truthful sarcasm: 'It seems the\r\nnecessity of faction in every country, that whenever it acquires\r\nsufficient boldness to inaugurate revolution, it then alike forgets the\r\ncounsels of prudence, and stifles the instincts of patriotism, and\r\nbecomes a suitor to foreign courts for aid and assistance to subvert and\r\ndestroy the most cherished and indispensable institutions of its own.'\r\n\r\nThus, within six weeks succeeding his entrance into the chambers of\r\nState, Mr. Seward had mapped out in his own brain a much more\r\ncomprehensive policy than he had even laboriously and ably outlined upon\r\npaper. He had placed himself in magnetico-diplomatic communication with\r\nthe great courts of Europe; surrounded by place-seekers, dogged by\r\nreporters, and paragraphed at by a thousand newspapers, from 'Fundy' to\r\n'Dolores.' And the most remarkable rhetorical feature of these many\r\ndispatches is the absence of iteration, notwithstanding they were\r\nwritten upon substantially one text. It is characteristic of them, as of\r\nhis speeches, that no one interlaces the other; each is complete of\r\nitself. Mr. Seward has always possessed that varied fecundity of\r\nexpression for which Mr. Webster was admired. A gentleman who\r\naccompanied him upon his Lincoln-election tour from Auburn to Kansas,\r\nremarked, that listening to and recalling all the bye-play, depot\r\nspeeches, and more elaborate addresses uttered by Mr. Seward during the\r\ncampaign, he never heard him repeat upon himself, nor even speak twice\r\nin the same groove of thought. Neither will any reader discover\r\nthroughout even these early dispatches a marked haste of thought, or a\r\nslovenly word-link in the Saxon rhetoric.\r\n\r\nSo far, we have alluded only to the instructions prepared before\r\nplenipotentiary departure. But the executive axe in the block of foreign\r\naffairs having been scoured, and new faces having fully replaced the\r\ndecapitated heads in foreign diplomatic baskets, circulars, instructions\r\nand dispatches daily accumulate, 'treading on each other's heels.' The\r\nvolume contains _one hundred and forty emanations_ from the pen of\r\nSecretary Seward. How many more there exist is only known to the Cabinet\r\nor the exigencies of secret service. Is not the bare arithmetical\r\nannouncement sufficient to satisfy the inquirer into Mr. Seward's\r\ndiplomatic assiduity? If not, will he please to remember as well Mr.\r\nSeward's perusals of foreign mails, cabinet meetings, consultation of\r\narchives or state papers or precedents, examinations into the relation\r\nof domestic events to foreign policy, and the inspection of the sands of\r\npeace or war in the respective hour-glasses of his department?\r\n\r\nThe circulars of Secretaries Black and Seward are promptly answered by\r\nMr. Dallas about a month after the inauguration, and whilst awaiting the\r\narrival of Charles Francis Adams. He said, among other things, 'English\r\nopinion tends rather, I apprehend, to the theory that a peaceful\r\nseparation may work beneficially for both groups of States, and not\r\ninjuriously affect the rest of the world. The English can not be\r\nexpected to appreciate the weakness, discredit, complications and\r\ndangers which _we_ instinctively and justly ascribe to disunion.'\r\n\r\nIn this connection, let us remark, that we recently listened to a very\r\ninteresting discussion, at the 'Union' club, between an English traveler\r\nof high repute, and a warm Unionist, upon the attitude of England. The\r\nformer seemed as ardent as was the latter disputant in his abhorrence of\r\nthe Southern traitors; but he constructed a very fair argument for the\r\nconsistency of England. Taking for his first position, that foreign\r\nnations viewed the Jeff Davis movement as a revolution, self-sustained\r\nfor nearly a year, his second was, that the most enlightened American\r\nabolitionists, as well as the most conservative Federalist, coincided in\r\nthe belief that disunion was ultimate emancipation. Then, acquiescing in\r\nthe statement of his antagonist, that the English nation had always\r\nreprehended American slavery, and desired its speedy overthrow, he\r\ninquired what more inconsistency there was in the English nation\r\nconstruing disunion in the same way wherein the American abolitionist\r\nand conservative Unionist did, as the inevitable promotion of slavery's\r\noverthrow? When it was rejoined that the canker of slavery had eaten\r\naway many bonds of Union, and promoted secession, the English disputant\r\ndemanded whether the war aimed at rebuking slavery in a practical way,\r\nor by strengthening it as a locally constitutional institution? When the\r\nquestion was begged by the assertion that recognition of the Southern\r\nconfederacy, although granted to be of abolition tendencies, was\r\nungenerous and unfraternal, the position assumed was that nations, like\r\nindividuals, cherished self-love, and always sought to turn intestine\r\ntroubles among competitive powers into the channels of\r\nhome-aggrandizement; and it was asked whether, should Ireland maintain\r\na provisional government for nearly a year, there would not be found a\r\nstrong _party_ in the States advocating her recognition?\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Seward, in replying to Mr. Dallas in a dispatch to Mr. Adams,\r\ndismissed all arguments of policy or consistency, and remarked: 'Her\r\nBritannic Majesty's government is at liberty to choose whether it will\r\nretain the friendship of this government, by refusing all aid and\r\ncomfort to its enemies, now in flagrant rebellion against it, _as we\r\nthink the treaties existing between the two countries require_, or\r\nwhether the government of her Majesty will take _the precarious benefits\r\nof a different course_.'\r\n\r\nSo early as May 2d, the British Secretary told Mr. Dallas that _an\r\nunderstanding existed between the British and French governments which\r\nwould lead both to take one and the same course as to recognition_. Mr.\r\nSeward comments upon this in one of the most manly letters ever written\r\nby an American Secretary. It will be preserved upon the same historic\r\nshelf whereon reposes the manuscript of Daniel Webster's letter to the\r\nChevalier Hulsemann. To Mr. Adams he says, that the communication loses\r\nits value because withheld until the knowledge was acquired from other\r\nsources, together with the additional fact that other European states\r\nare apprized by France and England of the agreement, and _are expected\r\nto concur with or follow them in whatever measures they adopt on the\r\nsubject of recognition!_ Great Britain, if intervening, is assured that\r\nshe will calculate for herself the ultimate as well as the immediate\r\nconsequences; and must consider what position she will hold when she\r\nshall have lost forever the sympathies and affections of the only nation\r\nupon whose sympathies and affections she has a natural claim. In making\r\nthat calculation she will do well to remember that in the controversy\r\nshe proposes to open, we shall be actuated neither by pride, nor\r\npassion, nor cupidity, nor ambition; but we shall stand simply upon the\r\nprinciple of self-preservation, our cause involving the independence of\r\nnations and the rights of human nature. These utterances were doubtless,\r\nin their book form, perused by the British cabinet during the Christmas\r\nholidays.\r\n\r\nTaking the pages which close up the word-tilts of the diplomatists at\r\ndate of November first (and we dare say our Board-of-Brokers readers\r\nregret that complete dispatches down to the sailing of the Africa, with\r\nthat interesting pouch of letters on board, are not to be had at all the\r\nbook-stores!) we may imagine Messrs. Russell, Adams, Seward and Lyons\r\nresolved into a conversational club, and talking as follows from week to\r\nweek:--\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams_. It is gratifying to the grandson of the first American\r\nMinister at this court to feel that there are now fewer topics of direct\r\ndifference between the two countries than have, probably, existed at any\r\npreceding time; and even these are withdrawn from discussion at St.\r\nJames, to be treated at Washington. It would have been more gratifying\r\nto find that the good will, so recently universally felt at my home for\r\nyour country, was unequivocally manifested here.\r\n\r\n_Lord Russell (smiling blandly)_. To what do you allude?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams_. It is with pain that I am compelled to admit that from the\r\nday of my arrival I have felt in the proceedings of both houses of\r\nParliament, in the language of her Majesty's ministers, and in the tone\r\nof opinion prevailing in private circles, more of uncertainty about this\r\nthan I had before thought possible. (_Lord Russell silent and still\r\nsmiling blandly_). It is therefore the desire of my government to learn\r\nwhether it was the intention of her Majesty's ministers to adopt a\r\npolicy which would have the effect to widen, if not to make irreparable\r\na breach which I believe yet to be entirely manageable.\r\n\r\n_Lord Russell_. I beg to assure your Excellency there is no such\r\nintention. The clearest evidence of this is to be found in the assurance\r\ngiven by me to Mr. Dallas, before your arrival. But you must admit that\r\nI hardly can see my way to bind my government to any specific course,\r\nwhen circumstances beyond our agency render it difficult to tell what\r\nmight happen.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward (aside)_. But the future will care for itself. We deal with\r\nthe 'Now.' '_There is \"Yet\" in that word \"Hereafter.\"_' Great Britain\r\nhas already acted on the assumption that the Confederate States (so\r\ncalled) are _de facto_ a self-sustaining power. After long forbearance,\r\ndesigned to soothe discontent and avert the need of civil war, the land\r\nand naval forces of the United States have been put in motion to repress\r\ninsurrection. The _true_ character of the pretended new state is\r\nrevealed. It is seen to be a power existing in pronunciamento only. It\r\nhas obtained no forts that were not betrayed into its hands or seized in\r\nbreach of trust. It commands not a single port, nor one highway from its\r\npretended capital by land.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams_. Her Majesty's proclamation and the language of her\r\nministers in both houses have raised insurgents to the level of a\r\nbelligerent state.\r\n\r\n_Lord Russell_. I think more stress is laid upon these events than they\r\ndeserve. It was a necessity to define the course of the government in\r\nregard to the participation of the subjects of Great Britain in the\r\nimpending conflict. The legal officers were consulted. They said war _de\r\nfacto_ existed. Seven States were in open resistance.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams_. But your action was very rapid. The new administration had\r\nbeen but sixty days in office. All departments were demoralized. The\r\nBritish government then takes the initiative, and decides practically it\r\nis a struggle of two sides, just as the country commenced to develop its\r\npower to cope with the rebellion. It considered the South a marine power\r\nbefore it had exhibited a single privateer on the ocean. The Greeks at\r\nthe time of recognition had 'covered the sea with cruisers.'\r\n\r\n_Lord Russell (smiling yet more blandly)_. I cite you the case of the\r\nFillmore government towards Kossuth and Hungary. Was not an agent sent\r\nto the latter country with a view to recognition?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward (aside)_. The proclamation, unmodified and unexplained,\r\nleaves us no alternative but to regard the government of Great Britain\r\nas questioning our free exercise of all the rights of self-defence\r\nguaranteed to us by our Constitution, and the laws of nature and of\r\nnations, to suppress insurrection. But now as to the propositions sent,\r\nviz. (1.) Privateering abolished. (2.) Neutral flag covers enemy's goods\r\nexcept contraband of war. (3.) Neutral goods safe under enemy's flag,\r\nwith same exception. (4.) Effective blockades.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams (aside to Mr. Seward)_. It is to be agreed to, if there be\r\nreceived a written declaration by Great Britain, to accompany the\r\nsignature of her minister,--'Her Majesty does not intend thereby to\r\nundertake any engagement which shall have any bearing, direct _or\r\nindirect_, on the internal differences now prevailing in the United\r\nStates.'\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward (still aside)_. I am instructed by the President to say it\r\nis inadmissible. (1.) It is virtually a new and distinct article\r\nincorporated into the projected convention. (2.) The United States must\r\naccede to the Declaration of the Congress of Paris on the same terms\r\nwith other parties, or not at all. (3.) It is not mutual in effect, for\r\nit does not provide for a melioration of _our_ obligations in internal\r\ndifferences now prevailing in, or which may hereafter arise in, Great\r\nBritain. (4.) It would permit a foreign power for the first time to take\r\ncognizance of, and adjust its relations upon, _assumed_ internal and\r\npurely domestic differences. (5.) The general parties to the Paris\r\nconvention can not adopt it as one of universal application.\r\n\r\n_Lord Russell_. Touching the disagreements as to acquiescing in the\r\nParis convention and the proposed modification, I ask to explain the\r\nreason of the latter. The United States government regards the\r\nconfederates as rebels, and their privateersmen as pirates. We regard\r\nthe confederates as belligerents. As between us and your government,\r\nprivateering would be abolished. We would and could have no concurrent\r\nconvention with the confederate power upon the subject. We would have in\r\ngood faith to treat the confederate privateersmen as pirates. Yet we\r\nacknowledge them belligerents. Powers not a party to the convention may\r\nrightfully arm privateers. Hence, instead of an agreement, charges of\r\nbad faith and violation of a convention might be brought in the United\r\nStates against us should we accept the propositions unreservedly.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams_. Your Lordship's government adhere to the proposition of\r\nmodification?\r\n\r\n_Lord Russell_. Such are my instructions.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams_. Then, refraining for the present from reviewing our past\r\nconversations to ascertain the relative responsibilities of the parties\r\nfor this failure of these negotiations, I have to inform you that they\r\nare for the time being suspended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams_. But your Lordship has many time _unofficially_ received the\r\nconfederate ambassadors, so styled. This has excited uneasiness in my\r\ncountry. It has, indeed, given great dissatisfaction to my government.\r\nAnd, in all frankness and courtesy, I have to add, that any further\r\nprotraction of this relation can scarcely fail to be viewed by us as\r\nhostile in spirit.\r\n\r\n_Lord Russell_. It has been custom, both here and in France, for a long\r\ntime back, to receive such persons unofficially. Pole, Hungarians,\r\nItalians, and such like, have been allowed unofficial interviews, in\r\norder that we might hear what they had to say. But this never implied\r\nrecognition in their case, any more than in yours!\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams_. I observe in the newspapers an account of a considerable\r\nmovement of troops to Canada. In the situation of our governments this\r\nwill excite attention at home. Are they ordered with reference to\r\npossible difficulties with us?\r\n\r\n_Lord Russell_. Canada has been denuded of troops for some time back.\r\nThe new movement is regarded, in restoring a part of them, as a proper\r\nmeasure of _precaution_ in the present disordered condition of things in\r\nthe United States. But Mr. Ashmun is in Canada, remonstrating as to\r\nalleged breaches of neutrality.\r\n\r\n(_Lord Lyons_. I viewed the subject as cause of complaint.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward_. And I instantly recalled Mr. Ashmun.)\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams_. He was in Canada to watch and prevent just such a\r\ntransaction as the fitting out of a pirate or privateer--the Peerless\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n_Lord Russell_. Mr. Seward threatened to have the Peerless seized on\r\nLake Ontario.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams_. I respectfully doubt your Lordship's information. It was\r\nsurely an odd way of proceeding to furnish at once the warning in time\r\nto provide against its execution!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams_. I deeply regret a painful necessity which compels me to\r\nmake a representation touching the conduct of Consul Bunch at\r\nCharleston. A private and opened letter, intercepted on the person of a\r\nnaturalized American citizen and colonel in the confederate\r\narmy,--Robert Mure, bearer of dispatches to Great Britain,--disclosed\r\nthese words: 'Mr. Bunch, on oath of secrecy, communicated to me that the\r\nfirst step to recognition was taken. _So prepare for active business_ BY\r\nTHE FIRST OF JANUARY.'\r\n\r\n_Lord Russell_. I will without hesitation state to you _that, in\r\npursuance of an agreement between the British and French governments,\r\nMr. Bunch was instructed to communicate to the persons exercising\r\nauthority in the so-called confederate States, the desire of those\r\ngovernments that certain articles of the declaration of Paris should be\r\nobserved by them in their hostilities(!)_ But regarding the other\r\nstatement, I as frankly say, Her Majesty's government have not\r\nrecognized, and are not prepared to recognize, the so-called confederate\r\nStates as a separate and independent power.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward (aside to Mr. Adams)_. The President revokes the exequatur\r\nof Consul Bunch, who has not only been the bearer of communications\r\nbetween the insurgents and a foreign government in violation of our\r\nlaws, but has abused equally the confidence of the two governments by\r\nreporting, without the authority of his government, and in violation of\r\ntheir own policy, as well as of our national rights, that the proceeding\r\nin which he was engaged was in the nature of a treaty with the\r\ninsurgents, and the first step toward a recognition by Great Britain of\r\ntheir sovereignty. His whole conduct has been, not that of a friend to\r\nthis government, nor of a neutral even, but of a partisan of faction and\r\ndisunion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Lord Lyons_. My government are concerned to find that two British\r\nsubjects, Mr. Patrick and Mr. Rahming, have been subjected to arbitrary\r\narrest.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward_. At the time of arrest it was not known they were British\r\nsubjects. They have been released.\r\n\r\n_Lord Lyons_. They applied for habeas corpus, and its exercise was\r\nrefused. Congress has not suspended the writ. Our law officers say that\r\nthe authority of Congress is necessary to justify this arrest and\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Seward (with suavity, but profound dignity, as if the nation\r\nspoke)_. I have to regret that, after so long an official intercourse\r\nbetween the governments of the United States and Great Britain, it\r\nshould be necessary now to inform her Majesty's ministers that _all_\r\nexecutive proceedings are of the President. Congress has no executive\r\npower or responsibility. The President constitutionally exercises the\r\nright of suspending the writ of habeas corpus. This government does not\r\nquestion the learning of the legal advisers of the British Crown, or the\r\njustice of the deference which her Majesty's government pays to them;\r\nnevertheless, the British government will hardly expect that the\r\nPresident will accept _their_ explanation of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAre not the following inferences legitimately to be made from a close\r\nand calm study of the published dispatches respecting our foreign\r\nrelations with Great Britain, and in connection with much that has\r\ntranspired since their congressional publication?--\r\n\r\n1. The British government officers were in some way prepared to expect\r\nthat the election of Mr. Lincoln would result in an attempted disruption\r\nof the Union. The arrival of Governor Pickens in England just before the\r\npresidential election, and his arrival in New York, and immediate\r\njourney to South Carolina, on the day of that election, may be cited as\r\none of many coincidences--showing that the spirit of Cobb, Floyd, and\r\nThompson, if not their doings and plans, were parodied on the other side\r\nof the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n2. The British government were not averse to disunion from the outset,\r\nand seized every pretext of tariff, or of inaction respecting the\r\nrebellion, that it might quibble with the United States authority.\r\n\r\n3. The tone of the press, ministry and people was early heard, and\r\nechoed by Mr. Dallas to our government. Mr. Seward therefore, at the\r\noutset, knew his position, and most opportunely and dignifiedly\r\nmaintained a bearing all the more noble because it proceeded from a\r\ngovernment which had taken arms against a sea of troubles.\r\n\r\n4. The British government waited _only_ so long as international decency\r\ntechnically warranted before proclaiming an acknowledgment of _civil_\r\nwar in the United States, and accepting the government of Mr. Davis as\r\nan equal belligerent with that of Mr. Lincoln. This was a matured step,\r\nand a strong link in a chain of ultimate recognition.\r\n\r\n5. The Crown ministers early sought and obtained an understanding with\r\nFrance for mutual action: an understanding palpably hostile to the\r\nUnited States and tantalizingly acknowledged by open diplomacy.\r\n\r\n6. The British ministry construed strictly as against the Washington\r\ngovernment, but liberally as toward that of Jeff Davis, in regard to all\r\narising complications.\r\n\r\n7. The British government palpably permitted purchases and shipments of\r\ncontraband articles by Southern emissaries, but exercised the utmost\r\nvigilance when the United States agents entered the market for similar\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n8. The action of Lord Russell respecting the proposition to abolish\r\nprivateering was covertly insulting. It asked to interpolate a new\r\ncondition as between France and England of the one part and the United\r\nStates of the other; and a condition conceived in a spirit of liberality\r\ntoward Jeff Davisdom, and promulgated in a meddlesome mood toward the\r\nUnited States government.\r\n\r\n9. The tone of Lord Lyons was a more permissible manifestation of\r\nBritish spleen than the higher functionaries at home displayed, yet none\r\nthe more acrid. This appears in all his letters and dispatches\r\nrespecting blockade, privateering, the arrest of spies, and the\r\ndetention of British subjects, or the seizure of prizes. It is\r\nespecially offensive in the letter to Mr. Seward which drew forth a\r\ndiplomatic rebuke upon a dictation by English law authority regarding\r\nconstitutional construction.\r\n\r\n10. The correspondence of the State Department was conducted by Mr.\r\nSeward (as was well said by the N.Y. Evening Post, Dec. 21) with great\r\nskill and adroitness. It was also firm in the defence of our national\r\nhonor and rights. His rhetoric was always measured by the dignified,\r\ntasteful, and cautious rules of international intercourse. Its entire\r\ntone in correspondence was earnest but restrained, and in style fully\r\nequaling his best, and most ornate efforts.\r\n\r\nWhat are Mr. Seward's views in the 'Past' respecting England and the\r\nemergency of a war with her, is a question now much mooted. It can be\r\nreadily answered by reference to a speech made at a St. Patrick's Day\r\ndinner whilst he was Governor. 'Gentlemen, the English are in many\r\nrespects a wise as they are a great and powerful nation. They have\r\nobtained an empire and ascendancy such as Rome once enjoyed. As the\r\nTiber once bore, the Thames now bears the tribute of many nations, and\r\nthe English name is now feared and respected as once the Roman was in\r\nevery part of the world. England has been alike ambitious and\r\nsuccessful. England too is prosperous, and her people are contented and\r\nloyal. But contentment and loyalty have not been universal in the\r\nprovinces and dependencies of the English government. The desolation\r\nwhich has followed English conquest in the East Indies has been lamented\r\nthroughout the civilized world. Ireland has been deprived of her\r\nindependence without being admitted to an equality with her\r\nsister-island, and discontent has marked the history of her people ever\r\nsince the conquest. England has not the magnanimity and generosity of\r\nthe Romans. She derives wealth from her dependencies, but lavishes it\r\nupon objects unworthy of herself. She achieves victories with their aid,\r\nbut appropriates the spoils and trophies exclusively to herself. For\r\ncenturies she refused to commit trusts to Irishmen, or confer privileges\r\nupon them, unless they would abjure the religion of their ancestors.'\r\n\r\nTen years later, in the United States Senate, during the debate upon the\r\nFisheries dispute, Mr. Seward said, after discussing England's financial\r\nand commercial position: 'England can not wisely desire nor safely dare\r\na war with the United States. She would find that there would come over\r\nus again that dream of conquest of those colonies which broke upon us\r\neven in the dawn of the Revolution, when we tendered them an invitation\r\nto join their fortunes with ours, and followed it with the sword--that\r\ndream which returned again in 1812, when we attempted to subjugate them\r\nby force; and that now, when we have matured the strength to take them,\r\nwe should find the provinces willingly consenting to captivity. A war\r\nabout these fisheries would be a war which would result either in the\r\nindependence of the British Provinces, or in their annexation to the\r\nUnited States. I devoutly pray God that _that_ consummation may come;\r\nthe sooner the better: but I do not desire it at the cost of war _or of\r\ninjustice_. I am content to wait for the ripened fruit which must fall.\r\nI know the wisdom of England too well to believe that she would hazard\r\nshaking that fruit into our hands.'\r\n\r\nAnother question, now asked,--'Will Mr. Seward exhaust\r\nnegotiation?'--may be in like manner answered by himself. In a\r\nsucceeding debate on the same 'fisheries' controversy, commenting upon\r\nnegotiation, he said: '_Sir, it is the business of the Secretary of\r\nState, and of the government, always to be ready, in my humble judgment,\r\nto negotiate under all circumstances, whether there be threats or no\r\nthreats, whether there be force or no force: but the manner and the\r\nspirit and the terms of the negotiation will be varied by the position\r\nthat the opposing party may occupy_.'\r\n\r\nIt can not be denied that more cordial relations exist between the\r\nPresident and the Secretary of State than ever any previous\r\nadministration disclosed: so that when Mr. Seward acts, the government\r\nwill prove a powerful unit. Indeed, in this connection, history will\r\nhereafter write precisely what Mr. Seward, in his speech on the\r\n'Clayton-Bulwer treaty,' said respecting the Taylor\r\nadministration:--'Sir, whatever else may have been the errors or\r\nmisfortunes of that administration, want of mutual confidence between\r\nthe Secretary of State and his distinguished chief was not one of them.\r\nThey stood together firmly, undivided, and inseparable to the last.\r\n_Storms of faction from within their own party and from without beset\r\nthem, and combinations and coalitions in and out of Congress assailed\r\nthem with a degree of violence that no other administration has ever\r\nencountered_. But they never yielded.'\r\n\r\nWe can not better conclude this paper, while the volumes of Mr. Seward's\r\nworks are open on the table, than by quoting still again, and asking the\r\nreader to apply his own remarks on Secretary of State Webster in the\r\nfisheries-war speech, before alluded to: 'I shall enter into no encomium\r\non the Secretary of State; he needs none. I should be incompetent to\r\ngrasp so great a theme, if it were needed. The Secretary of State! There\r\nhe is! Behold him, and judge for yourselves. There is his history; there\r\nare his ideas; his thoughts spread over every page of your annals for\r\nnear half a century. _There are his ideas, his thoughts impressed upon\r\nand inseparable from the mind of his country and the spirit of the age_.\r\nThe past is at least secure. The past is enough of itself to guarantee a\r\nfuture of fame unapproachable and inextinguishable.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Yankee chain you'd gladly split,\r\n  And yet begin by heating it!\r\n  But when the iron is all aglow,\r\n  'Twill closer blend at every blow.\r\n  Learn wisdom from a warning word,\r\n  Beat not the chain into a sword.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE HEIR OF ROSETON.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1.\r\n\r\nQui curios simulant, et Bacchanalia vivunt. JUV.\r\n\r\nOdi Persicos apparatus. HOR.\r\n\r\nIndulge Genio: carpamus dulcia. PERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoseton awoke. A silver clock upon the mantle, so constructed as to\r\nrepresent Guido's 'Hours,' had just struck the hour of eight,\r\naccompanying the signal with the festal _la ci darem_ of Don Giovanni.\r\nThis was Roseton's invariable hour of waking, no matter what might be\r\nthe season, or what might have been his time of retiring. Slightly\r\nstirring upon the couch, the night drapery became relaxed, and from his\r\nsleeve of Mechlin lace appeared a hand and wrist of unspeakable\r\ndelicacy, yet of iron strength. Another slight movement, and one saw the\r\nupper portions of the form of the late slumberer; 'a graceful\r\ncomposition in one of Nature's happiest moments.' It was indeed\r\ndifficult properly to estimate either the beauty of his proportions or\r\ntheir amazing strength. The most celebrated sculptors of Europe had made\r\npilgrimages across the sea to refresh their perceptions by gazing upon a\r\nfigure which, even in the unclassic habiliments of modern dress, caused\r\nthe Apollo to resemble a plowboy; and the athletes of both hemispheres\r\nhad, singly, and in pairs, and even in triplets, measured their powers\r\nvainly against his unaided arms. To keep ten fifty-sixes in the air for\r\nan hour at a time was to him the merest trifle; but the _ennui_ of such\r\ndiversions had long since crept upon him, and only on occasions of the\r\nextremest urgency did he exercise any other faculties than those of the\r\nwill. In compliance with an effort of the latter nature, his favorite\r\nservant now entered the apartment. The Rev. Geo. Langford had but a\r\nmoment before been deeply engaged in solving the problem of the fourth\r\nsatellite of Jupiter, when a sharp, tingling sensation in the rear of\r\nhis brain convinced him that a master will desired his attendance. The\r\nscholar, who thus rose to be the servant of Roseton,--a position that\r\neven the President of a Western college might envy, such were its\r\ndignities and emoluments,--stood for a moment at the foot of Roseton's\r\ncouch, and in silence received the silent orders of the day. No words\r\npassed, but in an incredibly short space of time Roseton's commands had\r\nflashed into the mind of his attendant, and the latter withdrew to\r\nreduce them to writing for the benefit of the four masters of the four\r\ndepartments of the House. They in turn methodized them for their\r\nforty-eight deputies, and one hundred and ninety-two servants--in\r\naddition to the female who came to the house to receive the weekly\r\nwash--performed their daily task intelligently and harmoniously.\r\n\r\nA bath of atar of roses next received the master of the House of\r\nPont-Noir. This was renewed every hour of the day; for Roseton's fancy\r\nindulged the frequent and the casual lavation, and his exacting taste\r\ndemanded the strictest purity. A careless servant once ventured to leave\r\nthe bath filled without a change of the fluid, after it had been\r\noccupied; but the negligence was at once detected by the master of\r\nPont-Noir, and his weekly allowance of cologne-water was summarily\r\nreduced. Upon the ceiling, over the bath, were frescoed, in Titianelli's\r\nrichest style, the most graceful legends of mythology. Here Theseus\r\ntoyed with Ariadne; here the infant Mercury furtively enticed the\r\nGrecian Short-horns; here Triton blew his seaweed-tangled horn, and\r\ntroops of ocean-nymphs threw the surface of the deep into 'sparkling\r\ncommotions of splendor;' here Venus allured Anchises, by sweetly calling\r\nhim to the leafy tops of Ida; here Deucalion surmounted the miraculous\r\nfloods; and here Pyrrha first instructed wondering men in the knowledge\r\nof the existence, beauties and duties of the fairer part of creation.\r\nHere, reclining in dreamful ease, and indulging in the perpetual warmth\r\nby which the bath confessed the power of unseen caloric agency, Roseton\r\nwas wont ever to sport with delicious memories, now with rapturous\r\nhopes, and at times to compose those elegant sonnets for the New York\r\nweekly newspapers, for each one of which a thousand dollars was joyfully\r\ngiven by the delighted proprietors to the poor of the city.\r\n\r\nCarefully wiped, and clothed in a morning robe by twelve gentlemanly\r\nattendants, each one a scion of the first families of the metropolis,\r\nRoseton was borne to the breakfasting apartment. Here, indeed, a scene\r\npresented itself, among whose splendors imagination only could safely\r\ndwell, and before which the practical and the prosaic mind might well\r\ngrow comatose or skeptical. Malachite tables of every conceivable shape\r\nfrom the Ural; carpets to whose texture the shawls of Cashmere had\r\nbecome tributary; paintings by all the known, and many of the unknown,\r\nold masters; these were only rivaled by chairs of the most undeniable\r\nand gorgeous curled maple; and a beaufet of true cherry acknowledged, in\r\ncommon with a Jerome horologe, a Connecticut origin. These incredible\r\nadjuncts to luxury were, however, eclipsed by the dazzling glory of a\r\nvast pyramid of purest oreide, which at its apex separated into four\r\ndivisions to the sound of slow music, by forty hidden performers,\r\nrevealing, as it descended to the floor, an equal number of tables, on\r\nwhich plate, Sévres China, Nankin porcelain, and the emerald glass of\r\nNew England, rivaled the display of damask, fruits, liqueurs, and\r\ndelicatest meats. Here smoked a sweetbread, here gleamed a porgy, not\r\nyet forty-eight hours caught, and here the strawberry crimsoned the\r\ncream that lapped its blushing sides. Here the Arabian berry evolved\r\nclouds of perfume; here Curaçoa glistened from behind its strawy shield;\r\nand here a decanter of warranted real French brandy, side by side with a\r\nbottle of Stoughton's bitters, suggested that a cocktail might not only\r\nbe desirable, but possible. But Roseton's eyes gazed languidly upon the\r\nspectacle, and the walls of the pyramid again ascending, shut the\r\nquadruple banquets from the sight.\r\n\r\nA moment elapsed, and they fell once more. A fountain of cool, fragrant\r\ndistillation threw showers of delight into the atmosphere, under the\r\ncanopy of which again appeared four luxurious tables. Upon one, tea and\r\ntoast suggested the agreeable and appropriate remedy for an over-night's\r\ndissipation; upon another, an array of marmalades, icy tongues reduced\r\nby ether to a temperature of minus sixty, Finnane haddock, and oaten\r\nmeal of rarest bolting, indicated and offered to gratify the erratic\r\ntaste of a Caledonian. Again, upon another, a Strasburg pie displayed\r\nits delicious brown, the members of the emerald songster of the fen lay\r\nwhitely delicate, and accompanying absinthe revealed the knowledge of\r\nGallic preferences. Upon the fourth, smoking and olent Rio, puddings of\r\nIndian, cakes composed of one third butter, one third flour, one third\r\nsaleratus, and the crisping bean, surmounted by crimped pork, showed\r\nthat a Providence Yankee might well find an appropriate entertainment.\r\nBut again the eyes of Roseton looked vacantly on, and again, amid\r\nstrains of music, the walls of the pyramid ascended.\r\n\r\nA short pause, and they sunk again. Now appeared, as a central figure,\r\nan odalisque. In each ivory hand she bore a double fan of exquisite\r\nworkmanship, on each of which again glistened a delicate and fairy\r\nbanquet. Here were ultimate quintessences--pines reduced to a drop of\r\nhoneyed delight; bananas whose life lay in points of bewildering\r\nsweetness; enormous steamboat puddings compressed within the compass of\r\na thimble, exclusive of the sauce; chocolates, oceans of which lay in\r\nmimic lakes, each of which the bill of a humming-bird might expand;\r\ntongues of most melodious singing birds--the nightingale, the thrush,\r\nand the goldfinch; lambs _en suprême_, each eliminated of earthly\r\nparticles, and spiritualized in scarcely tangible results. Over all\r\nhovered the memories of exquisite beverages, which became realities when\r\nyou approached, and stole over the sense with insidious deliciousness.\r\n\r\nThese, too, faded away amid the disregard of their owner, though the\r\nodalisque shed floods of tears of disappointment; and others succeeded,\r\nbut they tempted Roseton vainly, and a glance at the clock showed that\r\nit was now ten o'clock by New Haven time. At this moment the Rev. George\r\nLangford experienced another biological sensation; Roseton had conceived\r\na breakfast.\r\n\r\nRepairing to a battery in a recess of his laboratory, Langford\r\nattentively studied the ebullitions occasioned by an ultimate dilution\r\nand aggregation of the chemicals in the formula HP + O^(22). During this\r\ntime the sensations in his brain successively continued to rack and\r\nagonize him; but, faithful to his mission, he remained immersed in\r\nthought until his intellect grasped the key of the problem. Issuing then\r\nfrom the recess, he promulgated the results of his investigation to the\r\nfour masters of the house, These, with the aid of the forty-eight\r\ndeputies, executed the inchoate idea, and once more--and finally--the\r\npyramid unfolded. But now a single table appeared, bearing upon its\r\nsnowy mantle a Yarmouth bloater, and a bottle of Dublin stout. Roseton's\r\neyes lighted up with unaccustomed pleasure, and he gave instant commands\r\nfor the duplication of the salary of his esteemed attendant-in-chief.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the custom of the house, the morning journals now\r\nappeared; and here the fancy of Roseton had therein a living and\r\ndistinctive character over each. Youths, of perfect beauty, who had,\r\nduring the three previous hours, diligently studied the sheets in\r\nquestion, passed before him, one by one, dressed in appropriate costume,\r\nand each one delivered to him in mental short-hand the entire contents\r\nof the journal which he represented. These were rendered wholly in the\r\nSanscrit tongue, in which Roseton was an adept; with the exception of\r\nthe _Tribune_, the language of which, Roseton was accustomed to say, is\r\nunique, and incapable of translation. First appeared the representative\r\nof the _Herald_, dressed as a jockey; an irresistible air of assurance\r\naccompanied him, and he threw frequent summersaults with inconceivable\r\nquickness. Next marched the _Tribune_;--a youth shrouded in inexplicable\r\ngarments, and the living centre of a whirlwind of exploding theories.\r\nThen stepped the _Times_ in rapid succession; a blooming boy dressed\r\nwith precision, and delicately balancing himself as he delivered his\r\npart. Next appeared the _World_, habited as a theological student, and\r\nsorrow for irreparable loss was indicated by a Weed upon his hat. One\r\nlooked for the embodiment of the _News_ in vain, but a Wooden figure,\r\nwheeled in silence through the apartment, was thought to convey a\r\nmysterious lesson. A martial ghost, wearing upon his head a triple\r\ncrown, like the vision of Macbeth, yet bravely supporting himself under\r\nthe three-fold encumbrance, seemed the _Courier_ of Wall Street. The\r\npageant passed, but Roseton seemed unsatisfied; and it soon occurred to\r\nhim that the deep draughts of secession news, which he had been\r\naccustomed to receive each morning from the _Journal of Commerce_, had,\r\non this occasion, failed him. But on further reflection his infallible\r\nlogic convinced him that the existence of this paper must have ceased at\r\nthe same time with that of the Southern mails.\r\n\r\nIt now remained to perform the morning toilet; and a corps of attendants\r\nconveyed Roseton to his dressing-room. Here the lavish wealth of the\r\nPont-Noirs found another appropriate field for its display. The floor\r\nwas of Carrera marble, curiously tesselated, rising in the centre to the\r\nsupport of a fountain, where water-nymphs breathed forth shattered\r\ncolumns of fragrant spray, whose parabolic curves filled a spacious lake\r\nbelow. Vases of diamond, emerald and ruby crowded the mantles, each\r\nfilled with some unknown perfume--the result of Roseton's miraculous\r\nchemistry; for in this science Roseton was supreme. In a single day he\r\nexhausted the resources of American laboratories, and a short visit to\r\nEurope convinced him that henceforth he must be his own instructor.\r\nSavants in vain solicited his formulas. 'Why,' he reasoned, 'should I\r\nfurnish children in science with tools of which they can not comprehend\r\nthe use?' Delicate tables, chiseled from the humbler gems, were\r\nscattered about the chamber; agate, topaz, lapis-lazuli, amethyst, and a\r\nsmaragdus of miraculous beauty. Chairs of golden wire completed the\r\nfurniture of this unequaled apartment.\r\n\r\nThe hangings of the walls were a freak at once of genius and lavishness.\r\nThey consisted of the bills of the Valley Bank, extravagantly lapped,\r\nand of untold denomination. But the ceiling--how shall I describe it?\r\nDid you, indeed, look up inimitably into a Hesperian sky, or was this\r\nfirmament the creation of the painter's art? Nothing flecked the\r\nprofound, unsearchable, impassive blue. There brooded the primeval\r\nheavens, undimmed by earthly vapors, unfathomed by earthly instruments;\r\nforever indescribable by earthly tongues.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years before, a Pont-Noir of the Roseton branch accumulated\r\nimmense wealth from a diamond mine in East Haddam, Connecticut. He was a\r\nman of deep and ardent imagination, and uncomprehended by the simple\r\nvillagers, who irreverently styled him the 'mad Roseton.' He died, and\r\nleft a singular will. It provided that his estates, money, and jewels,\r\nshould be realized and invested on interest for the space of two hundred\r\nyears, by a committee of trustees, consisting of the governors of the\r\nsix New England States, to be assisted by the fiscal board of\r\nMississippi, whenever such a State should be organized. At the\r\nexpiration of that time, the avails were to be paid to Roseton, of\r\nPont-Noir, provided but one of that name should exist; if more were\r\nliving, the estate was to remain in abeyance until such a condition\r\nshould be reached. Not undiscerningly had he foreseen the probability\r\nthat his will would be disputed, and a short time before his death he\r\ncaused a formal attestation of his sanity to be made by the entire body\r\nof clergymen comprising the Middlesex Conference. His mode of proof was\r\nsimple, consisting only of an original manuscript, refuting the Arminian\r\nheresy; but it sufficed, and the will was obeyed. Not unwisely, also,\r\nhad he calculated upon the energies of population; for, during one\r\nhundred and fifty years, the Pont-Noirs spread over both continents.\r\nThen they paused, and but two of the race--chosen by lot--were allowed\r\nto marry. At the expiration of twenty-five years, a single male of the\r\nrace, also chosen by lot, married, and became the father of the present\r\nRoseton. On the day that Roseton was twenty-four years old, his father\r\nsummoned him to his apartment. 'To-morrow,' said he, 'the mystical two\r\nhundred years expire, and an estate of inconceivable magnitude will vest\r\nin the single Roseton--if there be but one. My son, my life is of less\r\nconsequence than yours, since it is farther spent; but it still has\r\nsweetness, and it is the _only_ life that I possess. Here are three\r\ngoblets of wine--one is Scuppernong, the other two are harmless. I will\r\napportion our chances fairly, and will drink two; you shall drink one.\r\nThe lawyers are at hand to arrange the inquest, and to confer the\r\ntitle-deeds to the estate.' In silence the son consented, and the\r\ndevoted pair drank off the goblets as proposed, and at once sat down to\r\na banquet prepared for them, and for the legal gentlemen attendant. When\r\nthe ices came in, the elder Roseton was carried out; and the heir of\r\nPont-Noir, having seen the remains properly bestowed in a place of\r\nsafety, and a special inquest held, finished the night with the\r\ncounsellors in the enjoyment of a tempered hilarity, and rose next\r\nmorning the possessor of wealth so boundless, so unspeakable, that my\r\nbrain reels as I endeavor to grasp at even its outlying fragments.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of presenting some of its details to the reader, I procured,\r\nat an enormous expense, a Babbage calculating engine, and during three\r\nsuccessive weeks worked it without pause upon the illimitable figures.\r\nIt then became clogged, and the village Vulcan, whose impartial hand\r\ncorrects at once the time-pieces and the plowshares of the neighborhood,\r\nhaving knocked the machinery to pieces with a sledge, declared himself\r\nincompetent to explain and unable to repair. My results therefore are\r\nmaimed and imperfect, but I trust they will show that I have not\r\nexaggerated the difficulty of the process of reduction and estimation.\r\n\r\nThe fragmentary portions of the estate, then, are: the entire capital\r\nstock of thirty-eight of the Banks of New York city (though here a wise\r\npolicy has suggested the employment of various respectable names as\r\nthose of shareholders, in order to protect these institutions from the\r\nfury of a mob); all that portion of the metropolis lying between the\r\nTwelfth and Twenty-second Avenues, from Canal Street to the suburb of\r\nPoughkeepsie, comprising of necessity the water rights and quarries;\r\neighteen thousand millions of bullion specially deposited in the State\r\nBank of Mississippi, to the order of the six New England Governors,\r\ntrustees; the Pont-Noir mansion on Nultiel Street, surrounded by\r\ntwenty-five acres of land, the very heart of the best New York\r\nresidences, and variously estimated from six to eight millions of\r\ndollars; the remote but tolerably well known villages of Boston and\r\nPhiladelphia in their entirety; and one undivided tenth of the stock of\r\nthe Valley Bank. It was upon the last investment that Roseton chiefly\r\ndrew for his expenses. 'My fancy,' said he, 'inclines me to convert\r\nBoston into an observatory, and Philadelphia into a tea-garden, and\r\nnothing but an amiable regard for the comfort of a handful of families\r\nprevents at once from carrying such plans into effect. My mansion is of\r\nnecessity unproductive; and the Mississippi bullion is greatly needed\r\nwhere it already is. City property is a dreadful nuisance, the taxes are\r\noutrageous and the tenants pay poorly; and although the New York Banks\r\nannounce dividends, yet when you come to look at their actual condition,\r\nhum, hum;--is that door shut?--just put your ear a little this way, so;\r\nthere, I say nothing; there are Banks and Banks; but a building may have\r\ntwo doors, and what goes _out_ at one may come _in_ again at the other,\r\neh? Mind, I say nothing. So you see, beside the East Haddam diamond\r\nmines, which are at present badly worked; and a few South American\r\nrepublics which are chiefly occupied in assassinating their presidents;\r\nand a border State or two that usually leave me to provide for their\r\nhalf-yearly coupons;--besides these resources, you see, I have really\r\nlittle else to look to but the Valley Bank.'\r\n\r\nWhile the possessor of this wealth is undergoing his morning toilet, let\r\nus attend the steps of his butler in chief, whose duty it was to prepare\r\nthe eleven-o'clocker with which Roseton was accustomed to fortify\r\nhimself against the fatigues of the middle part of the day. Passing down\r\na succession of flights of stairs, each one consisting of two hundred\r\nand twenty-five steps of the finest ebony, we at last find ourselves in\r\nan immense cavern, dimly lighted by the internal fires of the earth,\r\nwhich are here approached and verified. It was, however, left for\r\nRoseton to discover that these flames consisted of negative qualities as\r\nto caloric; and a project for cooling the streets of Newport by night,\r\nin summer, by means of floods of brilliant radiance, every point of\r\nwhich shall surpass the calcium light of the Museum, will soon evince to\r\nsociety that Roseton has not lived in vain. It was indeed a place of\r\nrarest temperature, and a sublime sense of personal exaltation thrilled\r\nyou as you entered. The butler approached an arch, and unlocking a\r\nwicker door which was ingeniously contrived to admit air, but to exclude\r\nthe furtive or the inquisitive hand, threw open to your inspection the\r\nimmense wine-cellar within.\r\n\r\nSuch indeed were the dimensions of the crypt that some little time might\r\nelapse before your eye could fully gauge them: but on accustoming\r\nyourself to the enlarged mensuration occasioned by the unearthly light,\r\nyou saw that the cavity in question could not be less than six feet high\r\nat the top of the arch, three feet wide, and at least forty-eight inches\r\ndeep. It was musty, cobwebbed, and encrusted with stalactic nitre, but\r\nthe spirit of rare old vintages exhaled from its depths, and visionary\r\nclusters of purplest grapes dangled in every direction. And first your\r\neye lighted upon a half dozen real old India Port, picked up by golden\r\nchance at an assignee's sale in Rivington Street. The chalk-mark on the\r\nbottles was intended to be cabalistically private, but an acquaintance\r\nwith the occult dialect of Spanish Zingari convinced you that 1/2, meant\r\nnothing else than that the bottles represented twelve and a half cents\r\neach, with three years interest,--a fabulous sum, but lavished in a\r\ndirection where the pledge of a dukedom had not been irrational, if the\r\nobject could not have been otherwise accomplished. Next a row of Medoc\r\nclaimed the enraptured attention; delicately overspread with the dust of\r\nyears, but flashing through the filmy covering the undeniable blood of\r\nthe Honduras forest. Here might one well pause and indulge in Clautian\r\nmemories: the violent remonstrances of Nature against, and her\r\nsubsequent acquiescence in, the primal draughts of _vin ordinaire_,\r\nwhether expertly served by a Delmonico, or carelessly decanted by the\r\nHibernian attendant in the gorgeous saloon of a Taylor; next the ascent\r\nto St. Julien, Number 2, when haply a friend from the country lingers at\r\nthe office, and you see no way of escape but an exodus in quest of\r\nchicken and green peas; a blushing crimson at the surface and unknown\r\nclouds below; then the _De Grave_ in delicate flagons, a fit sacrifice\r\nto the exquisite tastes of the editor who is to notice your forthcoming\r\nvolume, or to the epicurean palate of some surcharged capitalist, into\r\nwhose custody you are about to negotiate some land-grant bonds.\r\nRecovering from these delicious souvenirs, your attention was drawn to\r\nthe Sauternes, indisputably titled at a Wall Street sale, and priceless.\r\nThis wine had never yet been tasted, for Roseton was wont to say, 'I\r\nonly care for vitriol when it is a hundred years old,' and this had only\r\nseen the summer of twenty. But a precious odor breathed from the casks,\r\nand the corroding capsules confessed the mighty powers that lurked\r\nwithin. Inhaling this odor, you seemed to see the Original White Hermit\r\nhimself, brooding over his tiny principality of barren rock, and\r\nperforming miracles with the aid of the imported carboy and the\r\nindigenous rill. As the evening gloomed, and twilight fell among the\r\ncrags, a faint snicker spread upon the air, and in the dim light of the\r\nrising moon one might fancy a finger laid to the side of the nose of the\r\nholy man. From these reveries, a smart blow on the back, neatly executed\r\nby the butler, recalled your active attention to a demi-john of\r\nwarranted French brandy, and a can of Bourbon certified by the\r\nhand-writing of Louis Capet himself. Upon the sawdust in the lower\r\nniches of the vault lay packages of the finest Hollands, wicker\r\ncasements of Curaçoa, and the apple-jack of Jersey in gleaming glass.\r\nBut the eye dwelt finally, and with a crowning wonder and approval, upon\r\nan entire basket of the celebrated eleven-dollar Heidsieck champagne,\r\nblue label, that lay upon the floor of the crypt.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this treasure was one of those rare good-fortunes by\r\nwhich the life of here and there an individual is illustrated. About a\r\nyear previous to this, in the dead of night, a mysterious stranger\r\nsolicited audience of the master of Pont-Noir. Attended by the entire\r\nforce of the house in complete armor, Roseton granted the interview. The\r\nstranger advanced within easy gun-shot, and said:--'The great house of\r\nBoscobello, Bolaro and Company is in imminent peril. Unless a certain\r\nsum can be raised by two o'clock to-morrow, their acceptances will lie\r\nover. These acceptances constitute the entire loan and discount line of\r\nthirty-eight of the Banks of this city, for they have latterly made it a\r\nrule to take nothing else.' A meaning glance shot from the stranger's\r\neye as he delivered this fearful announcement, but Roseton remained\r\nfirm, though a cold shiver passed through the frames of his domestics,\r\nwho were aware how vitally he was interested. 'The pledge of their stock\r\nof wine alone,' continued the mysterious visitant, 'will relieve them\r\nfrom their difficulties, and the capitalists then stand ready to carry\r\nthem forward if they will retire from the Southern trade. Ten hundred\r\nnickels is the sum required, and I stand prepared to deliver the\r\nsecurity by ten o'clock, A.M. The discount is immense, but the\r\nexigencies of the case are weighty.'\r\n\r\nA consultation ensued. The bill for the kitchen crockery had just come\r\nin, and a set of three-tined forks were badly needed; but Roseton's\r\nintellect grasped the necessities of the operation, and the necessary\r\nfunds were ordered to be advanced; and the pledge, now forever forfeited\r\nby the loan clause of the Revised Statutes, lay upon the floor of the\r\nvault.\r\n\r\nThe aged butler delicately lifted a flask from its encampment of straw,\r\nand bore it to that section of the apartment where the light was\r\nclearest. 'I wonder if the boss would miss it, if we should just smell\r\nof this here bottle,' said the faithful servitor. Turning it his hand,\r\nit flashed brilliant rays on every side. Entangled among these played\r\nvivid and beautiful pictures, changeable as auroras, yet perfect, during\r\ntheir brief instant of existence, as the imaginations of Raphael, or the\r\ntranscripts of Claude.\r\n\r\nHere then you saw a sunny hill, and troops of vintagers dispersed along\r\nits sides, whose outlines wavered in the afternoon heats. But you\r\nrapidly outlived this scene, and now the broad plains of Hungary lay\r\nbefore your gaze. Speeding over the contracted domains of the Tokay, you\r\nentered upon the Sarmatian wastes, where the wild vines fought for life\r\nwith the icy soil and the chill winds of the desert. Uncouth proprietors\r\nurged on the unwilling peasants to the acrid press, and rolled out\r\nbarrels of the 'Rackcheekzi' and the 'Quiteenough-thankzi' vintage,\r\ncuriously labeled to a New York destination. Soon you beheld Water\r\nStreet, and long low cellars, where groups of boys cleansed now the\r\nclouded flask, and now the imperfectly preserved cork. Now bubbles of\r\nthe rarest carbonic acid gas flow, in obedience to the powerful machine,\r\nin all directions through the glassy prison; and rows of gleaming\r\nbottles indicate the activity of the enterprise. Then you saw the dining\r\nrooms of the Saint Sycophant and the Cosmopolitan Hotels. Here flew the\r\nresounding cork, to be instantly snatched up by the attendant Ethiopian,\r\nand scarcely were the champagne flasks emptied before they were reft\r\nfrom the tables with unimpaired labels. At the rear doors, there seemed\r\nto wait handcarts, and soon in these the corks, the bottles, and the\r\nbaskets were carefully bestowed for their down-town journey, and money\r\nappeared to pass from hand to hand. Then you saw a sleighing party in\r\nthe country, and soon a hostel of goodly size. The travelers entered and\r\ndemanded banquet; and while they masticated the underdone and tendonous\r\nChanticleer, quaffed deeply of the amber vintage of the previous\r\nvisions. Again you saw morning couches, where lovely woman tore her\r\nValenciennes night-cap in agonies of headache, and where her ruder\r\npartner filled the air with cries for 'soda-water!'\r\n\r\nEngaged with these enchanting dreams, the butler made a false step, and\r\nthe precious package, falling to the floor, was instantly shattered. The\r\nfluid trickled away in rivulets, but the ascending odors made amends for\r\nthe untimely loss, and you felt that it might all be for the best, and\r\nhaply a bill for medical attendance avoided. But the butler brooded over\r\nthe scene of the calamity in hopeless despair; and you perceived that it\r\nwould be necessary for him deeply to infringe upon his master's stores\r\nof cordial before his former serenity might be regained.\r\n\r\nIt was now after eleven, and Roseton's carriage waited. He entered,\r\nsimply saying to the footman who lifted him in, 'To Mundus;' and shortly\r\nthe vehicle stopped before the most palatial mansion in the entire\r\nextent of the Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\nI pause a moment before I attempt the portraiture of the young wife of\r\nMundus. Her shadow has indeed flitted once before across these pages\r\n(see Chapter Four of the Novel), but the dim outlines of a shadow may be\r\ntraced by a hand that is powerless to paint the living, breathing\r\nfigure. The boudoir where she sat was draped with the fairest pinks of\r\nthe Saxony loom, and the carpet confessed an original Axminster\r\nworkmanship. With this one, the pattern was created and extinguished,\r\nand, though it cost Mundus five thousand dollars, he drew his check for\r\nthe bill with a smile. The sofas and chairs were of hand-embroidered\r\nvelvet, representing the delicate adventures of Wilhelm Meister; and the\r\npaintings that profusely lined the walls gave form to the warmest scenes\r\nof Farquahar's 'gayest' comedies. Bella herself sat near a window,\r\nnegligently posed, reading the 'Journal of a Summer in the Country,'\r\nover which she had now hung for three hours in speechless admiration,\r\nbreakfastless, and with her slipper-ribbons not yet tied. 'I _must_ see\r\nwhat becomes of Wigwag,' she replied to Mundus, as he called through the\r\ndoor that he was eating all the eggs. 'Thank Heaven,' she finally\r\nexclaimed, as he went down into the smoking room, 'that's the last of\r\n_him_ to-day; and now I shall have this delicious book all to myself,\r\nand all myself to this delicious book.'\r\n\r\n'That's very prettily turned now,' said a silvery voice; 'nothing could\r\nhave been prettier,--but you'--\r\n\r\n'Oh, you naughty man, is that you already?' said Bella; 'didn't you meet\r\nthe Bear as you came in?'\r\n\r\n'He is in the front basement, sucking his paws,' replied Roseton, for it\r\nwas indeed he, 'and he is trying to do a stupider thing, if possible.'\r\n\r\n'What's that?' asked the fair Bella. 'Now don't tire me with any of your\r\nnonsense.'\r\n\r\n'To read himself,' answered Roseton.\r\n\r\n'You alarm me,' exclaimed she; 'it can't be possible that the servants\r\nhave let him have a looking-glass, contrary to my express instructions!'\r\n\r\n'No, no,' said the master of Pont-Noir, 'he is at work over the\r\n_World_.'\r\n\r\n'The _World?_' said Bella, inquiringly. 'Pray don't give me a headache.'\r\n\r\nRoseton leaned over her shoulder, and placed in her lap a miniature\r\nAndrews and Stoddard's Lexicon, open at the eight hundredth page. 'You\r\ntake?' he said: '_Mundus_, the World.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, Percy,' sighed Bella, 'why do you thus unnecessarily fatigue me?\r\nHave I not often told you that, faultless as you are in every other\r\ndepartment of life, and how I love to dwell upon this fact, still,\r\nstill, my Percy, your puns, or rather your attempts, are worse than\r\nthose of a Yale College freshman? You are cruel, indeed you are, thus to\r\ndisappoint and wound me. Be persuaded by me, and _never_ try again.'\r\n\r\nRoseton paused, irresolute--it was a great struggle; but what will not\r\none do for the woman one loves? 'I promise,' said he, at last; and,\r\nbending over her, laid a kiss--like an egg--upon her brow. 'This will\r\nforever bind me.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, dear Percy,' said Bella; 'and I hope you'll keep your\r\npromise better than you did the last one you made about giving up\r\nsmoking. You're sure you haven't tumbled my collar, and that you wiped\r\nthe egg off your moustache before you came in; get me the toilet-glass,\r\nthere's a good boy. You men are _so_ careless, and I shouldn't like it\r\nto dry on my forehead.'\r\n\r\nLet us approach, and gaze into the mirror. Can one describe that\r\nface--the lovely brown eyebrows; the eyes, like a spring sky, just as\r\nthe light, fleecy clouds are leaving it after a shower; the perfect\r\nroses, dipped in milk, of the skin; the lips where good-nature,\r\nsprightliness, and love, lay mingled in ambush; the dewy teeth never\r\nquite concealed? It is, indeed, useless to attempt it. And, what is very\r\nremarkable, Bella knew it. 'There, Percy,' said she, 'your indiscretion\r\nis cleared away, and now upon my word I don't know which flatters me\r\nmost, you or the glass.'\r\n\r\n'Why, I haven't tried yet,' replied Roseton.\r\n\r\n'That's only because you know you can't,' said she;' neither can this\r\npoor little mirror. But to think what Mundus said yesterday!'\r\n\r\n'What did he say?'\r\n\r\n'He said--he said--he saw a pretty apple-girl in Wall Street, and I\r\npresume the wretch paid her some compliment or other while he was buying\r\nher apples, for he appeared very much pleased after he came home, and he\r\nhasn't bestowed a compliment on me since the month after we were\r\nmarried. Ah, fated word! Ah, Percy, Percy!--on that ill-omened day, what\r\ncaused you to linger? We _might_ even then have retraced our steps, and\r\nbeen--happy.'\r\n\r\n'I was waiting--at the dock--for the news--of the Heenan prize-fight,\r\nBella,' gasped Roseton, turning away to conceal his emotion, and to\r\nassuage the tears that fell from his manly eyes. It is a mournful sight,\r\na strong man, in the morning of life, weeping; but Roseton's agony might\r\nwell excuse it. 'I know it was unpardonable, but my card of invitation\r\nhad been tampered with, the date altered; and, Bella--my Bella--we were\r\nthe victims of a base deception!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, my Percy,' faintly cried Bella, letting the book fall to the\r\nground in her confusion; 'traitorous wiles, indeed, encompassed us, and\r\nthe arts of a Mundus were too subtle for my girlish brain. I sometimes\r\nfear that my poor frame will sink under the agonies I endure.'\r\n\r\nRoseton raised the volume from the floor. 'I am told,' said he, 'that\r\nthis is a very ingenious work, and that no gentleman's library is\r\ncomplete without it; but I never read. My days, my nights, are filled,\r\nBella, with thoughts of you. Yes,' continued he, seating himself upon\r\nthe sofa by her side, and passing his arm about her throbbing waist,\r\n'yes, you are my muse--my only volume. You are the inspiration of the\r\npoetical trifles that I send to the weekly newspapers, and which I may\r\nsay, without vanity, are considered equal to Mrs. Sigourney's. Without\r\nyou, life were indeed a dreary void; and without you, I should be\r\ndreadfully bored of a morning.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, Percy,' murmured the fair listener, 'so could I hear you talk\r\nforever.'\r\n\r\n'Bella,' whispered Roseton, in her fairy ear, 'could you prepare your\r\nmind to entertain the idea of flight with me?'\r\n\r\n'To Staten Island?' cried she, jumping up and clapping her hands. 'Oh,\r\nlet's go to Staten Island! Mundus can never follow us there, the boats\r\nare so dangerous.'\r\n\r\n'But, Bella _mia_' said Roseton, in the soft accent of Italy, 'as the\r\neminent but slightly impractical Hungarian--I refer to Kossuth--said,\r\nStaten Island \"is lovely, but exposed.\" We should not be safe there.\r\nListen; in my house I have prepared a secret chamber, fifty feet square,\r\nplentifully supplied with healthful though plain provisions, and\r\nfurnished with a tolerable degree of comfort. There will we dwell, until\r\nthe curiosity of Mundus and the whispers of the metropolis are overpast.\r\nWe will then re-appear in society, and assert our happiness. Bella,\r\n_mia_ Bella, shall it be so?'\r\n\r\n'Ah, Percy,' sighed she, leaning back in his arms, 'let it be just as\r\nyou say.'\r\n\r\nTheir lips--\r\n\r\n'Bella,' said Mundus, leaning over the pair, and fumbling among the\r\nvases over the fireplace, 'is there any stage change on the mantlepiece,\r\nor have either you or Roseton got such a thing about you as a sixpence?\r\nI have nothing in my pocket but hundred-dollar city bills, and those\r\ninfernal omnibus drivers make change with Valley Bank notes, which a\r\ncertain _person_ furnishes them,'--and Mundus fixed his eyes full on the\r\nmaster of Pont-Noir.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Roseton,' he continued, 'will you be so kind as to call at my\r\noffice after the Second Board, to-day? I have matters of importance to\r\ndiscuss with you.' And so saying, the haughty banker strode from the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nRoseton's eyes mechanically followed him. In an instant he turned to\r\nBella. She had fainted upon the sofa. His first impulse was to apply his\r\nvinaigrette; but 'no,' he said to himself, 'this will probably last\r\ntwenty minutes, and do her good. During that time I can smoke a cigar,\r\nand arrange my plans. But stop,'--and here a cold sweat broke out upon\r\nhim, and a livid paleness overspread his features,--'what did Mundus say\r\nabout the notes? He refuses them! Strange, strange, indeed! Can it then\r\nbe that the Valley Bank has bu--?'[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: This is all of this interesting family tale that will\r\nappear in this place.

At the present moment, however, the condition\r\nof the country is unpromising enough; yet not so gloomy as to preclude\r\nthe hope of a fortunate issue. The sacrifices and sufferings of the\r\npeople are greater in civil than in foreign wars, and the ultimate\r\nadvantages and benefits are proportionately large. We speak now of those\r\ncivil wars which have occurred between people inhabiting the same\r\ndistrict of country,--as the civil wars of England. Other contests, as\r\nthe revolutions of Hungary, Poland, and Ireland even, were not, strictly\r\nspeaking, civil wars. The parties were of different origin, and had\r\nnever assimilated in language, customs, or ideas. The struggle was for\r\nthe reëstablishment of a government which had once existed, and not for\r\nthe reformation or change of a government that at the moment of the\r\nconflict was performing its ordinary functions.\r\n\r\nThe civil war in America does not belong to either of the classes named.\r\nTo be sure, in Missouri, Kentucky, and Western Virginia, the contest has\r\nbeen between the inhabitants of the several localities, aided by forces\r\nfrom the rebel States on the one hand, and forces from the loyal States\r\non the other. But those States, as such, were never committed to the\r\nrebellion; and the struggle within their limits has demonstrated the\r\ninability of the so-called Confederate States to command the adhesion of\r\nMissouri, Kentucky, and Western Virginia by force; but it does not, in\r\nthe accomplished results, demonstrate the ability of the United States\r\nto crush the rebellion. The border States were debatable ground; but the\r\nquestion has been settled in favor of the government so far, at least,\r\nas Western Virginia and Missouri are concerned.\r\n\r\nIn the eleven seceded States there is no apparent difference of opinion\r\namong those in authority, or among those accustomed to lead in public\r\naffairs. The sentiment of attachment to the old Union has been\r\ndisappearing rapidly since the secession of South Carolina, until there\r\nare now no open avowals of adherence to the government, unless such are\r\nmade by the mountaineers of Eastern Tennessee and Western North\r\nCarolina. These men are for the present destitute of power. Should our\r\narmies penetrate those regions, the inhabitants may essentially aid in\r\nthe reëstablishment of the government. Still, for the present, we must\r\nregard the eleven States as a unit in the rebellion. Thus we are called\r\nto note the anomalous fact that the rebels seek a division between a\r\npeople who speak the same language, occupy a territory which has no\r\nmarked lines or features of separation, and who have from the first day\r\nof their national existence been represented by the same national\r\ngovernment. Hence it is plain, whatever may be the immediate result of\r\nthe contest, that there can be no permanent peace until the territory\r\nclaimed as the territory of the United States is again subject to one\r\ngovernment. This may be the work of a few months, it may be the work of\r\na few years, or it may be the business of a century. Without the\r\nreëstablishment of the government over the whole territory of the Union\r\nthere can be no peace; and without the reëstablishment of that\r\ngovernment there can be no prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe armies of the rebel States will march to the great lakes, or the\r\narmies of the loyal States will march to the gulf of Mexico. We are\r\ntherefore involved in a war which does not admit of adjustment by\r\nnegotiation. In a foreign war, peace might be secured by mutual\r\nconcessions, and preserved by mutual forbearance. In ordinary civil\r\nstrife the peace of a state or of an empire might be restored by\r\nconcessions to the disaffected, by a limitation of the privileges of the\r\nfew, or an extension of the rights of the many. But none of these\r\nexpedients meet the exigency in which we find ourselves. The rebels\r\ndemand the overthrow of the government, the division of the territory of\r\nthe Union, the destruction of the nation. The question is, _Shall this\r\nnation longer exist?_ And why is the question forced upon us? Is there a\r\ndifference of language? Not greater than is found in single States.\r\nIndeed, Louisiana is the only one of the eleven where any appreciable\r\ndifference exists, and the number of French in that State is less than\r\nthe number of Germans in Pennsylvania. Nor has nature indicated lines of\r\nseparation like the St. Lawrence and the lakes on the north and the\r\nRocky Mountains on the west. The lines marked by nature--the Rocky\r\nMountains, the Mississippi River, and the Alleghanies--cut the line\r\nproposed by the confederates transversely, and force the suggestion that\r\neach section will be put in possession of three halves of different\r\nwholes, instead of a single unit essential to permanent national\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nDo the products of the industry of the two sections so conflict with\r\neach other in domestic or foreign markets as to encourage the idea that\r\nby separation the South could gain in this particular? Not in the least.\r\nThe North has been a large customer for the leading staple of the South,\r\nand the South is constantly in need of those articles which the North is\r\nfitted to produce. The South complains of the growth of the North, and\r\nvainly imagines that by separation its own prosperity would be promoted.\r\nThe answer to all this is, that there has never been a moment for fifty\r\nyears when the seceded States had not employment, for all the labor that\r\nthey could command, in vocations more profitable than any leading\r\nindustry of the North; and, moreover, every industry of the North has\r\nbeen open to the free competition of the South. Not argument, only\r\nstatement, is needed to show that by origin, association, language,\r\nbusiness, and labor interests, as well as by geographical laws, unity\r\nand not diversity is the necessity of our public life. Yet, in defiance\r\nof these considerations, the South has undertaken the task of destroying\r\nthe government. Nor do the rebels assert that the plan of government is\r\nessentially defective. The Montgomery constitution is modeled upon that\r\nof the United States; though the leaders no longer disguise their\r\npurpose to abolish its democratic features and incorporate aristocratic\r\nand monarchical provisions. They hope, also, to throw off the restraints\r\nof law, bid defiance to the general public sentiment of the world, and\r\nreopen the trade in slaves from Africa. It remains to be seen whether\r\nthe desire of England for cotton and conquest, and her sympathy with the\r\nrebels, will induce her to pander to this inhuman traffic.\r\n\r\nIt has happened occasionally that a government has so wielded its powers\r\nas to contribute, unconsciously, to its own destruction. But our\r\nexperience furnishes the first instance of a government having been\r\nseized by a set of conspirators, and its vast powers used for its own\r\noverthrow.\r\n\r\nIt is now accredited generally that several members of Mr. Buchanan's\r\ncabinet were conspirators, and that they used the power confided to them\r\nfor the purpose of destroying the government itself. Hence it appears,\r\nwhatever the test applied, that the present rebellion is distinguished\r\nfrom all others in the fact that it does not depend upon any of the\r\ncauses on which national dissensions have been usually based.\r\n\r\nThe public discontents in Ireland, in their causes, bore a slight\r\nanalogy to our own. There were existing in that country various systems\r\nand customs that were prejudicial to the prosperity of the island. Among\r\nthese may be mentioned the Encumbered Estates and Absenteeism; and it is\r\nworthy of remark that whatever has been done by the British government\r\nfor the promotion of the prosperity of Ireland, and the pacification of\r\nits people, has been by a reformation of the institutions of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nRebels in arms may be overthrown and dispersed by superior force, but\r\nthe danger of rebellion will continue so long as the disposition to\r\nrebel animates the people. This disposition can not be reached by\r\nmilitary power merely; the exciting cause must be removed, or, at least,\r\nso limited and modified as to impair its influence as a disturbing force\r\nin the policy of the country. As we have failed to trace this rebellion\r\nto any of the causes that have led to civil disturbances in other\r\ncountries, it only remains to suggest that cause which in its relations\r\nand conditions is peculiar to the United States. All are agreed that\r\nslavery is the cause of the rebellion. Yet slavery exists in other\r\ncountries,--as Brazil, for example,--and thus far without exhibiting its\r\nmalign influence in conspiracy and rebellion. This is no doubt true; but\r\nit should be borne in mind that, in the United States, slavery has power\r\nin the government as the basis of representation, and that the slave\r\nStates are associated in the government with free States. If the\r\ninstitution of slavery had not been a basis of political power, or had\r\nall the States maintained slavery, it is probable that the rebellion\r\nwould never have been organized, or, if organized, it could never have\r\nattained its present gigantic proportions.\r\n\r\nWe have now reached a point where we can see the error of our public\r\nnational life. The doctrine announced by President Lincoln, while he was\r\nonly Mr. Lincoln, of Springfield, that the nation must be all free or\r\nall slave, was not new with him. The men who framed the constitution\r\nacted under the same idea, though they may not have so distinctly\r\nexpressed the truth. There is, however, abundant circumstantial evidence\r\nthat they so believed, and that their only hope for the country was\r\nbased on the then reasonable expectation that slavery would disappear,\r\nand that the nation would be all free. It was reserved for modern\r\npolitical alchemists to discover the idea on which the leading\r\npoliticians have been acting for thirty or forty years, that one half of\r\na nation might believe in the fundamental principle on which the\r\ngovernment is based, and the other half deny it, and yet the government\r\ngo on harmoniously, wielding its powers acceptably and safely to all.\r\nThis is the error. Our failure is not in the plan of government; the\r\nerror is not that our fathers supposed that a government could be based\r\nand permanently sustained upon slavery and freedom advancing _pari\r\npassu_. They indulged in no such delusion. The error is modern. When\r\nslavery demanded concessions, and freedom yielded; when slavery\r\nsuggested compromises, and freedom accepted them; when slavery,\r\nunrebuked, claimed equal rights under the constitution, and freedom\r\nacknowledged the justice of the claim,--then came the test whether the\r\ngovernment itself should be administered in the service of slavery or in\r\nbehalf of freedom. Two considerations influenced the slaveholders.\r\nFirst, even should they be permitted to wield the government, they\r\nforesaw that its provisions were inadequate to meet the exigencies of\r\nslavery. No despotism can be sustained by the voluntary efforts of its\r\nsubjects. Slavery is a despotism; and as such can only be supported by\r\npower independent of that of the slaves themselves, and always\r\nsufficient for their control. The slaves were yearly increasing in\r\nnumbers and gaining in knowledge. These changes indicated the near\r\napproach of the time when the slaves of the South would reenact the\r\nscenes of St. Domingo. The plantations of the cotton region are remote\r\nfrom each other, and the proportion of slaves on a single plantation is\r\noften as many as fifty for every free person, The sale of negroes from\r\nthe northern slave States has introduced an element upon the plantations\r\nat once intelligent and hostile, and, of course, dangerous, The time\r\nmust come when the white populations of plantations, districts, or\r\nStates even, would disappear in a single night, In such a moment of\r\nterror and massacre how, and to what extent, would the United States\r\ngovernment, acting under the constitution, afford protection, aid, or\r\neven secure a barren vengeance? These were grave questions, and admitted\r\nonly of an unsatisfactory answer at best. The government has power to\r\nput down insurrections; but for what good would a body of troops be\r\nmarched to a scene of desolation and blood a fortnight or a month after\r\nthe servile outbreak had done its work? These considerations controlled\r\nthe intelligent minds of the South, and they were driven irresistibly to\r\nthe conclusion that the government of the United States was insufficient\r\nfor the institution of slavery, even though the friends of slavery were\r\nentrusted with the administration. What hope beyond? They dared to\r\nbelieve that by separation and the establishment of a military\r\nslaveholding oligarchy, to which the public opinion and public policy of\r\nthe seceded States now tend, they would be able to guard the institution\r\nagainst all tumults from within and all attacks from without. If success\r\nwere to crown their present undertakings, is it probable that the\r\ngovernment contemplated would be strong enough for the task proposed? If\r\nRussia could not hold her serfs in bondage, can the South set up a\r\ngovernment which can guard, and defend, and secure slavery? Or will a\r\nFrench or English protectorate render that stable which the government\r\nof the United States was incompetent to uphold? These questions remain,\r\nbut the one first suggested is settled:--That the government of the\r\nUnited States, howsoever and by whomsoever administered,\r\nconstitutionally, is inadequate to meet the exigencies of slavery.\r\n\r\nSecondly. The leaders of the rebellion foresaw, a long time since, that\r\nslavery had no security that the government would be administered in the\r\ninterest of that institution. The admission of California, followed by\r\nthe admission of three other free States, forced the slaveholders into a\r\nhopeless minority in the Senate of the United States. The census of 1860\r\npromised to reduce the delegation of the slave States in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Previous to 1870 other free States were likely to be\r\nadmitted into the Union; and thus by successive and unavoidable events,\r\nthe government was sure to pass into the hands of the non-slave States.\r\nIt would not be just to the South to omit to say that apprehensions\r\nthere existed that the North would disregard the constitution. These\r\napprehensions were fostered for unholy purposes; and so sealed is the\r\nSouth to the progress of truth, through the domination of the\r\nslaveholders over the press and public men, and by the consequent\r\nignorance of the mass of the people, that these misapprehensions have\r\nnever been removed in any degree by the declarations of Congress or of\r\npolitical parties in the North.\r\n\r\nThe mind of the South was thus brought logically to two conclusions:\r\nFirst, that the government of the United States was inadequate to meet\r\nthe exigencies of slavery, even though it should be administered\r\nuniformly by the friends of slavery. Secondly, that the administration\r\nof the government would be controlled by the ideas of the free States.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions would have been sufficiently unwelcome to the Southern\r\nleaders, if they had had no purpose or policy beyond the maintenance of\r\nslavery where it exists; but they had already determined to extend the\r\ninstitution southward over Mexico and Central America, and they knew\r\nfull well the necessity of destroying the Union and the government\r\nbefore such an enterprise could be undertaken with any hope of success.\r\nHence they denied the right of the majority to rule unless they ruled in\r\nobedience to the will of the minority. Thus the slaveholders came\r\nnaturally and unavoidably to the denial of the fundamental principle of\r\nthe government; and, having denied the principle, there remained no\r\nreason why they should not undertake the overthrow of the government\r\nitself. And thus the conspiracy and the rebellion sprung naturally and\r\nunavoidably from the institution of slavery.\r\n\r\nFurther, slavery is the support of the conspiracy and the rebellion both\r\nin Europe and America. However disastrous slavery may be to the mass of\r\nthe whites, it affords to the governing class the opportunity and means\r\nfor constant attention to public affairs.\r\n\r\nIn all our history the North has felt the force of this advantage. As a\r\ngeneral thing, a northern member occupies a seat in Congress for one or\r\ntwo terms, and then his place is taken by an untried man. And even\r\nduring his term of service, his attention is given in part to his\r\nprivate affairs, or to plans and schemes designed to secure a\r\nre-election. The Southern member takes his seat with a conscious\r\nindependence due to the fact that his slaves are making crops upon his\r\nplantation, and that his re-election does not depend upon the hot breath\r\nof the multitude. He enjoys a long and independent experience in the\r\npublic service; and he thus acquires a power to serve his party, his\r\ncountry or his section, which is disproportionate even to his\r\nexperience. A good deal of the consideration which the South enjoys\r\nabroad, and especially in England, is due to the fact that in the South\r\na governing class is recognized, which corresponds to the governing\r\nclasses wherever an aristocracy or monarchism exists. By a community of\r\nideas the South commands the sympathy, and enjoys the confidence and\r\nsecret support of the enemies of democracy the world over. Through the\r\npolitical and pecuniary support which the public men of that section\r\nhave derived from slavery, they have been able to take and maintain\r\nsocial positions at Washington, which, by circumstances, were denied to\r\nmuch the larger number of northern representatives, and thus they have\r\ninfluenced the politics of this country and the opinions of other\r\nnations. Consider by how many sympathies and interests England is bound\r\nto encourage the policy and promote the fortunes of the South. There is\r\nthe sympathy of the governing class in England for the governing class\r\nin the South, even though they are slaveholders; there is the hostility\r\nof the ignorant operatives in their manufacturing towns, who, through\r\nexterior influences, have been led to believe that whatever hardships\r\nthey are brought to endure are caused by the desire of the North to\r\nsubjugate the South; there is the purpose of English merchants and\r\nmanufacturers to cripple, or if possible to destroy the manufactures and\r\ncommerce of the North; and, finally, there is the hope of all classes\r\nthat by the alienation or separation of the two sections England would\r\nderive additional commercial advantages, and that the scheme of here\r\nestablishing a continental republic would be abandoned, never to be\r\nagain revived. There is, moreover, a reasonable expectation, founded in\r\nthe nature of things, and possibly already supported by positive\r\npromises and pledges, that England is to stand in the relation of\r\nprotector to the confederated States. Nor will she be in the least\r\ndisturbed by the institution of slavery, if perchance that institution\r\nsurvives the struggle. If she can be secure in the monopoly of the best\r\ncotton lands on the globe, if she can be manufacturer and shop-keeper\r\nfor the South, if she can deprive the North of one half of its\r\nlegitimate commerce, if she can obtain the control of the gulf of\r\nMexico, of the mouth of the Mississippi, if she can command the line of\r\nsea-coast from Galveston to Fortress Monroe or even to Charleston, and\r\nthus compel us to make our way to the Pacific by the passes of the Rocky\r\nMountains exclusively, there is no sacrifice of men, or of money, or of\r\nprinciple, or of justice, that would be deemed too great by the English\r\npeople and government. But what then? Are we to make war upon England\r\nbecause her sympathies and interests run thus with the South? Is it not\r\nwiser to consider why it is that the South is sustained by the interests\r\nand sympathies of England? If slavery for fifty years had been unknown\r\namong us, could there be found a hundred men, within the limits of the\r\nUnited States, who would accept a British protectorate under any\r\ncircumstances or for any purpose whatever? And is it not therein\r\nmanifest, that our foreign and domestic perils are alike due to slavery?\r\nAnd shall we not have dealt successfully with all our foreign\r\ndifficulties when we shall have established the jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States over the territory claimed by the rebels? But until that\r\nhappy day arrives, we shall not be relieved for an instant from the\r\ndanger of a foreign war; and if the rebellion last six months longer,\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that a foreign war can be averted. When we\r\noffer so tempting a prize to nations that wish us ill, can we expect\r\nthem to put aside the opportunity which we have not the courage and\r\nability to master? We have observed the hot haste of England to\r\nrecognize the rebels as belligerents; we have seen the flimsy covering\r\nof neutrality that she has thrown over the illegitimate commerce that\r\nher citizens have carried on with the South, and from the time, manner,\r\nand nature of her demand for the release of Mason and Slidell, we are\r\nforced to infer that she will seize every opportunity to bring about an\r\nopen rupture with the United States. And though Mr. Seward has carried\r\nthe country successfully through the difficulty of the Trent, we ought\r\nto expect the presentation of demands which we can not so readily and\r\njustly meet. Indeed, enough is known of the Mexican question to suggest\r\nthe most serious apprehensions of foreign war on that account.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for speedily crushing the rebellion is as strong as it was\r\nat the moment when Lord Lyons made the demand for the release of the\r\npersons taken from the deck of the Trent.\r\n\r\nIs there any reason, even the slightest, to suppose that by military and\r\nnaval means alone the rebellion can be crushed by the 19th of April\r\nnext?\r\n\r\nYet every day's delay gives the confederate States additional strength,\r\nand renders them in the estimation of mankind more and more worthy of\r\nrecognition and independent government. Their recognition will be\r\nfollowed by treaties of friendship and alliance; and those treaties will\r\ngive strength to the rebels and increase the embarrassments of our own\r\ngovernment. It is the necessity of our national life that the settlement\r\nof this question should not be much longer postponed.\r\n\r\nBy some means we must satisfy the world, and that speedily, that the\r\nrebellion is a failure. Nor can we much longer tender declarations of\r\nwhat we intend to do, or offer promises as to what we will do, in the\r\nface of the great fact that for eight months the capital of the Republic\r\nhas been in a state of siege. If, in these circumstances of necessity\r\nand peril to us, the armies of the rebels be not speedily dispersed, and\r\nthe leaders of the rebellion rendered desperate, will the government\r\nallow the earth to again receive seed from the hand of the slave, under\r\nthe dictation of the master, and for the support of the enemies of the\r\nconstitution and the Union? If there were any probability that the\r\nStates would return to their allegiance, then indeed we might choose to\r\nadd to our own burthens rather than interfere their internal affairs.\r\nBut there is no hope whatever that the seceded States will return\r\nvoluntarily to the Union.\r\n\r\nThere could be no justifying cause for the emancipation of the slaves in\r\ntime of peace by the action of the general government; and now it must\r\nbe demanded and defended as the means by which the war is to be closed,\r\nand a permanent peace secured. If before the return of seed-time the\r\nemancipation of the slaves in several or in all of the disloyal States\r\nbe declared as a military necessity, and the blacks be invited to the\r\nsea-coast where we have and may have possession, they will raise\r\nsupplies for themselves, and the rebellion will come to an ignominious\r\nend, through the inability of the masters, when deprived of the services\r\nof their slaves, to procure the means of carrying on the war.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSHE SITS ALONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  She sits alone, with folded hands,\r\n     While from her full and lustrous eyes\r\n  Imperial light wakes love to life,--\r\n     Love that, unheeded, quickly dies.\r\n\r\n  She sits alone, among them all\r\n     So near, and yet so far,--they seem\r\n  But our coarse waking thoughts, while she\r\n     Is the reflection of a dream.\r\n\r\n  She sits alone, so still, so calm,\r\n     So queenly in her grand repose,\r\n  You wish that Love would slap her cheeks\r\n     And make the white a blush-red rose!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHEAP COTTON BY FREE LABOR. By a Cotton Manufacturer. Second\r\n     edition. Boston: A. Williams & Company, 100 Washington Street.\r\n     1861. Price 12 cents.\r\n\r\nIt seldom happens that we find so many weighty facts within so short a\r\ncompass as are given in this pamphlet. For many years the assertion that\r\nonly the negro, and the negro as a slave, could be profitably employed\r\nin raising cotton in America, has been accepted most implicitly by the\r\nwhole country, and this has been the great basis of pro-slavery\r\nargument. But of late years, doubt has been thrown, from time to time,\r\non this assumption, and in the little work before us there is given an\r\narray of concise statements, which, until their absolute falsehood is\r\nproved, must be regarded as conclusive of the fact, that the white man\r\nis _better_ adapted than the negro to labor at the cultivation of\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nOur 'cotton manufacturer' begins properly by bursting the enormous\r\nbubble of the failure of free labor in the British West Indies; showing,\r\nwhat is too little known, that the decrease in the export of sugar from\r\nJamaica began and rapidly continued for thirty years before the\r\nemancipation of slaves, but has _since_ been well-nigh arrested. With\r\nthis decrease of export the _import of food has decreased, although the\r\npopulation, has increased_; but, at the present day, the aggregate value\r\nof the exports of _all_ the British West Indies is now nearly as great\r\nas it was in the palmiest days of slavery, while on an average the free\r\nblacks now earn far more for themselves than they formerly did for their\r\nmasters, and are therefore 'better off.' Even those who regard the\r\nnegro, whether a slave or free, as fulfilling his whole earthly mission\r\nin proportion to the profit which he yields Lancashire spinners, have no\r\njust grounds of complaint. But as regards the United States, there are\r\ncertain facts to be considered. According to the census of 1850, there\r\nwere in our slave States, 'where it is frequently asserted that white\r\nmen can not labor in the fields,' eight hundred thousand free whites\r\nover fifteen years of age employed exclusively in agriculture, and over\r\none million exclusively in out-door labor. Again, wherever the\r\nfree-white labor and small-farm system of growing cotton has been tried,\r\nit has invariably proved more productive than that of employing slaves.\r\nIt can not be denied that, deducting the expense of maintaining decrepit\r\nand infant slaves, every field hand costs $20 per month, and German\r\nlabor could be hired for less than this, the success of such labor in\r\nTexas fully establishing its superiority,--and Texas contains cotton and\r\nsugar land enough to supply three times the entire crop now raised in\r\nthis country. Such being the case, has not free labor a _right_ to\r\ndemand that these fields be thrown open to it, without being degraded by\r\ncomparison to and competition with slaves? Our author consequently\r\nsuggests that Texas, at least, shall be made free, and a limit thereby\r\nestablished to slavery in the older States. It would cost less than one\r\nhundred millions of dollars to purchase all the slaves now there, and\r\nthe completion of the Galveston railroad would have the effect of giving\r\nto Texas well-nigh the monopoly of the cotton supply. Such are, in\r\nbrief, the main points of this pamphlet, which we trust will be\r\ncarefully read, and so far as possible tested by every one desirous of\r\nobtaining information on the greatest social and economical question of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. By Joseph E. Worcester, LL.D.\r\n     Boston: Swan, Brewer & Tileston. 1862.\r\n\r\nTo boldly declare in favor of any _one_ dictionary at the present day,\r\nwould be as bold, and we may add as untimely and illogical a proceeding\r\nas to endorse any one grammar, when nothing can be clearer to the\r\nstudent of language than that our English tongue is more unfixed and\r\nundergoing changes more rapidly than any other which boasts a truly\r\ngreat literature. The scholar, consequently, generally pursues an\r\neclectic system, if timid conforming as nearly as may be to 'general\r\nusage,' if bold and 'troubled with originality,' making up words for\r\nhimself, after the manner of CARLYLE, which if 'apt,' after being more\r\nor less ridiculed, are tacitly and generally adopted. But, amid the 'war\r\nof words' and of rival systems, people must have dictionaries, and\r\nfortunately there is this of WORCESTER'S, which has of late risen\r\nimmensely in public favor. We say fortunately, for whatever discords and\r\ninconvenience may arise at the time from the rivalry of different\r\ndictionaries, it can not be doubted that each effort contributes vastly\r\nto enrich our mother-tongue, and render easier the future task of the\r\n'coming man' who is, years hence, to form from the whole one perfect\r\nwork. Our own verdict in the matter would, accordingly, be, that we\r\nshould most unwillingly dispense with either of the great candidates for\r\npopular orthographic favor.\r\n\r\n\r\n     RELIGIO MEDICI, A LETTER TO A FRIEND, CHRISTIAN MORALS, URN BURIAL,\r\n     AND OTHER PAPERS. By Sir Thomas Browne, Kt., M.D. Boston: Ticknor\r\n     and Fields. 1862.\r\n\r\nBeautiful indeed is the degree of typographic art displayed in this\r\nedition of one of the raciest and most readable of our sterling English\r\nclassics. The antique lettering of the title alone, in which words of\r\ncarmine-red alternate with the 'letters blake,' the counterpart\r\nportrait, and the neat red-illumined capitals of every chapter, not to\r\nmention the type and binding, all render this volume one of the most\r\nappropriate of gift-books for a friend of true scholarly tastes. Few\r\nwriters are so perfectly loved as Sir THOMAS BROWNE is by such\r\n'friends;' as in BACON'S or MONTAIGNE'S essays, his every sentence has\r\nits weight of wisdom, and he who should read this volume until every\r\nsentence were cut deeply in memory, would never deem the time lost which\r\nwas thus spent. Yet, while so deeply interesting to the most general\r\nreader, let it not be forgotten that it was with the greatest truth that\r\nDr. JOHNSON testified of him that 'there is scarcely a writer to be\r\nfound, whose profession was not divinity, that has so frequently\r\ntestified his belief of the sacred writings, has appealed to them with\r\nsuch unlimited submission, or mentioned them with such unvaried\r\nreverence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     TRAGEDY OF ERRORS. _Aux plus déshérités le plus d'amour_.

We can not agree with its very talented author in finding so\r\nmuch that is touching and beautiful in the negro, believing that the\r\nmotto which prefaces this work is simply a sentimental mistake. The\r\nnegro _is_ degraded, vile if you please, and not admirable at all, and\r\ntherefore we should work hard, and induce him too to work, rise, and\r\npurify himself. Apart from this little difference as to a fact, we have\r\nonly praise for this work, which is most admirably written, abounding in\r\nnoble passages of brave poetry, and bearing, like the 'Record of an\r\nObscure Man,' genial evidence of scholarship and refined thoughts and\r\ninstincts. It will, we sincerely hope, be very widely read, and we are\r\nconfident that all who _do_ read it will be impressed, as we have been,\r\nby the true genius of the author, even though they may dissent, as we\r\ndo, from the idealization of the negro as is here done. The cause of the\r\npoor was never yet aided by false gilding.\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past month our domestic difficulties have threatened to\r\nbecome doubly difficult, owing to the demand made upon this country by\r\nEngland, and to the circumstances attending it.\r\n\r\nVery recently it became known that on board of an English mail steamer,\r\n'The Trent,' were two men, Messrs. SLIDELL and MASON, accredited agents\r\nfrom a portion of the United States which is in open and flagrant\r\nrebellion against a constituted government which has been recognized as\r\nsuch by every nation in the world. Those men, calling themselves\r\nambassadors, and just as much entitled to that dignity or to official\r\nrecognition as two agents from NENA SAHIB would have been during the\r\nrevolt stirred up by that Hindoo, were taken by an officer of the United\r\nStates government from the Trent, under the full impression by him that\r\nthe seizure was in every sense legal.\r\n\r\nThe British government regarded this arrest an outrage, and promptly\r\nresponded by a demand for the restoration of Messrs. SLIDELL and MASON.\r\nNumerous 'indignation meetings' held in the great centres of English\r\ncommerce and manufactures echoed this demand, which received a\r\nthreatening form from the fact that great military and naval\r\npreparations, evidently aimed against the United States, were at once\r\nput under way.\r\n\r\nWas the seizure illegal?\r\n\r\nThe vast amount of international law which has been brought to light on\r\nthis subject, not merely in the press, but from the researches and pens\r\nof eminent jurists, led us to no severely definite conclusion. That an\r\nemissary is not a contraband of war as much as a musket or a soldier,\r\nappears preposterous, and offers a distinction which, as Mr. SEWARD\r\nobserves, disappears before the spirit of the law, M. THOUVENEL to the\r\ncontrary, notwithstanding. It was therefore in the mode of procedure in\r\nregard to the seizure of the emissaries that the trouble lay. According\r\nto law, the vessel, if carrying contraband of war, is liable to seizure.\r\nBut if this assumed contraband be _men_, these may not be guilty, and\r\nare entitled to a trial. Still, as the law--or want of law--stands, the\r\nseizure of the vessel is the requisite step, the minor issue being\r\npractically regarded as the major; an anomaly not less striking than\r\nthat which still prevails in certain courts, where, to recover damages\r\nfor seduction, the defendant can only be mulcted in a penalty for the\r\nloss of time caused to his victim. It was not possible for Captain\r\nWILKES to seize the vessel, Great Britain declined to waive her claim to\r\nthe execution of every jot and tittle of the letter of the law, and\r\nconsequently the 'contrabands' were surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of involving two great nations in a war, on account of a\r\nlegal paradox of this nature, requires no comment. The dry comment of\r\nGeneral SCOTT, that the 'wrong' would have been none had it only been\r\ngreater, recalls the absurd line in the old play:--\r\n\r\n  'My wound is great because it is so small;'\r\n\r\nand the supplement,--\r\n\r\n  'Then 'twould be greater were it none at\r\n  all.'\r\n\r\nBut, absurd or not, the law must be followed. Great nations must settle\r\ntheir disputes by the law, even as individuals do, and there is no shame\r\nin submitting to it, for submission to the constituted authorities is\r\nthe highest proof of honor and of civilization. And if England chooses\r\nto strain the law to its utmost tension, to thereby push her neutrality\r\nto the very verge of sympathy with our rebels, and manifest, by a\r\nperemptory and discourteous exercise of her rights, total want of\r\nsympathy with our efforts to suppress rebellion,--why, we must bear it.\r\n\r\nAnd here, leaving the letter of the law, we may appropriately say a few\r\nwords of the _animus_ which has inspired the 'influential classes' in\r\nEngland as regards this country, during our struggle with the South. We\r\nare assured that the mass of the English people sympathize with us, and\r\nwe are glad to hear it,--just as we are to know that Ireland is friendly\r\nin her disposition. But we can not refrain--and we do it with no view to\r\nwords which may stir up ill-feeling--from commenting, in sorrow rather\r\nthan anger, on the fact that such a majority of journalists,\r\ncapitalists, yes, and the mass of inhabitants of English cities, have so\r\nunblushingly, for the mere sake of money, turned their backs on those\r\nprinciples of freedom of which they boasted for so many years, flouting\r\nus the while for being behind them in the race of philanthropy! It is\r\npitiful and painful to see pride brought so low. We of the Federal Union\r\nare striving, heart and soul, to uphold our government--a government\r\nwhich has been a great blessing to England and to the world. Who shall\r\nsay what revolutions, what tremendous disasters, would not have\r\novertaken Great Britain had it not been for the escape-valve of\r\nemigration hither? If ever a situation appealed to the noblest\r\nsympathies of mankind, ours does. Struggling to maintain a government\r\nwhich has given to the poor man fuller rights and freer exercise of\r\nlabor than he has ever before known on this earth; fighting heroically\r\nto uphold the best republic ever realized;--who would have dreamed that\r\n'brave, free, honest Old England' would have regarded us coldly, sneered\r\nat our victories, grinned over our defeats? But more than this. Though\r\nnot avowed as an aim, and though secondary to our first great\r\nobject,--the reëstablishment of the Union and a constitutional\r\ngovernment,--we _all_ know, and so does every Englishman, that the\r\nemancipation of the slave, to a greater or less degree, _must_\r\ninevitably follow our success. Here comes the test of that English\r\nabolition of the blackest and fiercest stamp which has for years been\r\navowed in Great Britain, and which has done as much as aught else\r\ntowards stirring up this foul rebellion. Where be your gibes _now_, O\r\nBritannia? Where be your bitter jeers against the 'lying Constitution,'\r\nagainst the 'stars for the white man and the stripes for the negro,'\r\nagainst everything American, because America was the land of the slave?\r\nWe are fighting--dying--to directly uphold ourselves, and indirectly to\r\neffect this very emancipation for which you clamored; we are losing\r\ncotton and suffering everything;--but _you_, when it comes to the pinch,\r\nwill endure nothing for your boasted abolition, but slide off at once\r\ntowards aiding the inception of the foulest, blackest, vilest\r\nslaveocracy ever instituted on earth! Disguise, quibble, lie, let them\r\nthat will--these are _facts_. Because we, in our need, have instituted a\r\nprotective tariff, which was absolutely necessary to keep us from utter\r\nruin, and on the flimsy pretext that we are not fighting directly for\r\nemancipation, proud, free, and honest Old England, as publicly\r\nrepresented, eats all her old words, and, worse than withholding all\r\nsympathy from us, shows in a thousand ill-disguised ways an itching\r\nimpatience to aid the South! Men of England, _we_ are suffering for a\r\nprinciple common to all humanity; can not you suffer somewhat with us?\r\nCan you not, out of the inexhaustible wealth of your islands, find\r\nwherewithal to stave off the bitter need, for a season, of your\r\ncotton-spinners? Feed them?--why we would, for a little aid in our dire\r\nneed, have poured in millions of bushels of wheat to your poor,--one\r\nbrave, decided act of sympathy on your part for us would ere this have\r\ntrampled down secession, and sent cotton to your marts, even to\r\nsuperfluity. Or, were you so minded, and could 'worry through' a single\r\nyear, you might raise in your own colonies cotton enough, and be forever\r\nfree of America.\r\n\r\nOr is it really true, as many think, that your statesmen would gladly\r\ndismember this Union? The suggestion reveals such a depth of infamy that\r\nwe will not pause on it. Let it pass--if the hour of need _should_ come\r\nwe will revive it, and out of that need will arise a giant of Union such\r\nas was never before dreamed of. Let the country believe _that_, and from\r\nMaine to California there will be such a blending into one as time can\r\nnever dissolve!\r\n\r\nBut be it borne in mind;--and we would urge it with greater earnestness\r\nthan, aught which we have yet said,--there is in England a large, noble\r\nbody of men who do _not_ sympathize with the Southern rebels; who are\r\n_not_ sold, soul and body, to cotton; who see this struggle of ours as\r\nit is, and who would not willingly see us divided. These men believe in\r\nindustry, in free labor, in having every country developed as much as\r\npossible, in order that the industry of each may benefit by that of the\r\nother. Honor to whom honor is due,--and much is due to these men.\r\nMeanwhile we can wait,--and, waiting, we shall strive to do what is\r\nright. England has her choice between the cotton of the South and the\r\nmarket of the North. Let her choose the former, and she will grasp ruin.\r\nWe should suffer for a time, bitterly. But out of that suffering we\r\nshould come so strengthened, so united, and so perfectly able to\r\ndispense with all foreign labor, that where we were before as rough ore,\r\nthen we should be pure gold in our prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe first statesmen of England have shown by their speeches, as the\r\nfirst British journals have indicated in their articles, that they\r\nearnestly believe what Stephens and hundreds of other Southerners have\r\nasserted, that _all_ the wealth of the Northern States has come from the\r\nSouth, and that the South is the great ultimate market for the major\r\nportion of our imports. Glancing over our map,--as was done by _The\r\nTimes_,-the Englishman may well believe this. He sees a vast extent of\r\nterritory,--he has heard and witnessed the boasts and extravagance of\r\nSoutherners abroad,--he knows that where so many million bales of cotton\r\ngo out, just so much money must flow in; he is angry at our Northern\r\ntariff of emergency, and so believes that by opening to himself the\r\nSouth he will secure a vast market. Little does he reflect on the fact\r\nthat, this step once taken, he will close up in the North and West his\r\ngreatest market, one worth ten times that of the South, and constantly\r\nincreasing, just in proportion as our population progresses more rapidly\r\nthan that of the slave States. It is no exaggeration,--strange as it may\r\nseem,--but this extraordinary ignorance has been manifested time and\r\nagain by high authority in England since the war began. But supposing\r\nthe balance struck, and cotton found to be worth more to England than\r\nthe market of the North. Does not our very independence of English\r\nmanufactures imply such a stimulus to our own, as to threaten that we\r\nshall thereby be in a much shorter time in a condition to compete with\r\nher in every market of the world? Drive us to manufacturing for\r\nourselves, and we shall manufacture for every one. Already every year\r\nwitnesses American inventiveness achieving new triumphs over British\r\nrivalry. Has England forgotten the report of Messrs. Whitworth and\r\nWallis on American manufactures, in which they were told that of late\r\nyears they have been more indebted to American skill for useful\r\ninventions than to their own? War and non-intercourse will doubtless\r\ncompel us to economy, and render labor cheaper in America, but they can\r\nnot quench our innate Yankee-Saxon inventiveness and industry. But if\r\nlabor is made cheaper in America, then our final triumph will only be\r\nhastened. If England seeks her own ruin, she could not advance it more\r\nrapidly than she would do by a war or a difference with us. And this\r\nmany think that she will do for the sake of one season's supply of\r\nAmerican cotton! The fable of him who killed the goose for the sake of\r\nthe golden egg becomes terrible when acted out by a great nation. And if\r\nthis be true, then the uplifted sword of Albion is, verily, nothing but\r\na goose-killing knife.\r\n\r\n'God is not dead yet.' If we are in the right, He will guide and guard\r\nus, and they who contend for right and justice and the liberty of the\r\npoor, first fully taught on earth by the Saviour Jesus Christ, will not\r\nsuffer in the end. When we first entered on this struggle with the\r\nSouth, it was soon realized that we had undertaken the greatest struggle\r\nof history, the reformation of the modern age, the grandest battle for\r\nprogress and against the old serpent of oppression ever known. Let them\r\nlaugh who will, but such a trial of republicanism against the last of\r\nfeudalism is this, and nothing less. God aid us! But it may be that, as\r\nthe contest widens, grander accomplishments lie before us. Whether it be\r\ndone by the sword, or by peaceful industry; whether as victors, or as\r\nthe unrighteously borne-down in our sorest hour of need,--it is not\r\nimpossible that, in one way or the other, it is yet in our destiny to\r\nrefute the monstrous theory that whatever the most powerful nation on\r\nearth does is necessarily right, and that all considerations must yield\r\nto its enormous interests. Such has been till the present the morality\r\nof English and of all European diplomacy,--who will deny it? Can it be\r\npossible that this is to last forever, and that nations are in the\r\nonward march of progress privileged to adopt a different course from\r\nthat enjoined by God on individuals? 'Was Israel punished for this?' No,\r\nit can not be. We stand at the portal of a new age; step by step Truth\r\nmust yet find her way even into the selfish camarilla councils of\r\n'diplomacy.' Storms, sorrows, trials, and troubles may be before\r\nus,--but we are working through a mighty time. 'Nothing without labor.'\r\n_Our_ task for the present is the restoration of the sacred Union. From\r\n_this_ let _nothing_ turn us aside, neither the threats of England or of\r\nthe world. If we must be humiliated by the law, then let us bear the\r\nhumiliation. Our Great Master bore aforetime the most cruel disgrace in\r\nthe same holy cause of vindicating the rights of man. If new struggles\r\nare forced upon us, let us battle like men. We are living now in the\r\nserious and the great,--let us bear ourselves accordingly, and the end\r\nshall crown the work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is no use in disguising the fact--the people of the North,\r\nnotwithstanding their sufferings and sacrifices, are not yet _aroused_.\r\nWhile immediate apprehensions--were entertained of war with England, it\r\nwas promptly said, that if this state of irritation continued, we should\r\nbe able to sweep the South away like chaff.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the North is full of secession sympathizers and traitors, and\r\nthey are most amiably borne with. There are journals which, in their\r\nextreme 'democracy,' defend the South as openly as they dare in all\r\npetty matters, and ridicule or discredit to their utmost every statement\r\nreflecting on our enemies. They are, it is true, almost beneath contempt\r\nand punishment; but their existence is a proof of an amiable, impassive\r\nstate of feeling, which will never proceed to very vigorous measures.\r\nWere the whole people fairly aflame, such paltry treason would vanish\r\nlike straw in a fiery furnace.\r\n\r\nYet all the time we hold the great weapon idly in our hands, and fear to\r\nuse it! By and by it will be too late. By and by emancipation-time will\r\nhave gone by, and when it is too late, we shall possibly see it adopted,\r\nand hear its possible failure attributed to those who urged the prompt,\r\nefficient application of it betimes.\r\n\r\nThe article in this number of the Continental entitled The Huguenot\r\nFamilies in America, is the first of a series which will embrace a great\r\namount of interesting details relative to the ancestry of the early\r\nFrench Protestant settlers in this country. Those who are familiar with\r\nthe English version of WEISS'S History of the Huguenots, and who may\r\nrecall the merits of that concluding portion which is devoted to the\r\nfortunes of the exiles in this country, will be pleased to learn that\r\nits writer and our contributor are the same person--a gentleman whose\r\ndescent from the stock which he commemorates, and whose life-long\r\nstudies relative to his ancestral faith and its followers, have\r\npeculiarly fitted him for the task. Descendants of _any_ of the Huguenot\r\nfamilies, in any part of this country, would confer a special favor by\r\ntransmitting to the author, through the care of the editor, any details,\r\nfamily anecdotes, short biographic sketches, or other material suitable\r\nfor his history. It is especially desirable that some account should be\r\ngiven of all those descendants of Huguenots who have in any way whatever\r\ndistinguished themselves in this country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of the N.Y. Central Railroad it appears that the\r\naverage reduction of wages of the employes of that company, since the\r\nbeginning of the war, has been from $1.12 1/2 _per diem_ to 75 cents.\r\nTaking increased taxation and the rise in prices into consideration, we\r\nmay assume that the working men of the North have lost fifty per cent.\r\nof their usual gains.\r\n\r\nSo far as this is an honorable sacrifice for the war, it is good. But\r\nhow long is it to last? It will last until the _whole_ country shall\r\nhave lost a sneaking sympathy for the enemy and their institutions, and\r\nuntil every man and woman shall cease to openly approve of those\r\nprinciples which, as the secessionists truly maintain, constitute us\r\n'two peoples.' With what consistency can any one avow fidelity to the\r\nUnion and yet profess views according in the main with the platform of\r\nMessrs. DAVIS and STEPHENS?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDivested of all other issues, the great complaint of Europe against our\r\nconduct of the war is our 'inefficient blockade.' If we are to attach\r\nfaith to those arch-factors of falsehood, the New Orleans newspaper\r\neditors, a vessel leaves their port daily and securely for the Havana.\r\nIt was the same journals which some months since announced in each\r\nsucceeding issue that 'the fifteen millions loan is all taken;' 'the\r\nloan is very nearly taken;' 'it gives us pleasure to announce that the\r\nloan is now completed,' and so on, backing up their assertion's by a\r\nseries of truly amusing details of 'proof.'\r\n\r\nThat sundry vessels _have_ broken the blockade is as palpable as that it\r\nwas for some time most inefficiently conducted. Yet, at the same time,\r\nlet the enormous difficulties of the task be remembered, and our great\r\nwant of means at the beginning of the war, when, stripped by the\r\nmachinations of traitors for years, we had indeed to _begin_ from almost\r\nnothing. The coast from Maryland to Mexico is a different affair from\r\nthat of France or England. The great Napoleon himself, with all his\r\nefforts, could never keep his coast-line unbroken by smugglers. Had\r\nforeign critics of our war made the slightest friendly or kindly\r\nallowance, they would never have spoken as they do of our 'inefficient\r\nblockade.' But the great majority of their comments have been neither\r\nkindly nor friendly.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the work goes bravely on. 'The Stone Fleet' will soon have\r\neffectually stopped that 'rat-hole,' Charleston, and it is evident that,\r\nunless distracted by foreign intervention, the whole coast will be well\r\nwalled in and guarded. It must, will, and shall be done in time. 'It is\r\nmore difficult to move a mountain than a marble.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to trace the probable European results of a war\r\nbetween America and England. Russia, threatened with a servile war,\r\nwould find in a war with England the most effectual means of settling\r\nhome difficulties. Louis NAPOLEON, it is said, tacitly encourages\r\nEngland to get to war. How long would he remain her ally when an\r\nopportunity would present itself of avenging Waterloo? Or if Hungary\r\nand the Sclavonian provinces blazed up in insurrection, what price less\r\nthan the long-coveted Rhine, and perhaps Belgium, would Louis NAPOLEON\r\naccept for his services in aiding Austria? Or would he not take it\r\nwithout rendering such problematic service? Let England beware his\r\nfriendship. He is a great man, and for his subjects a good one,--but woe\r\nto those who trust him for their own ends or believe in his lore! There\r\nwas one VICTOR EMMANUEL who trusted him once--with the result set forth\r\nin the following merry lay:--\r\n\r\nA TRUE FABLE, WITHOUT A MORAL.\r\n\r\n  'This LOUIS is a rascal, friend;\r\n  From all his arts may Heaven defend!\r\n  And be thou ever on thy guard,\r\n  Lest thy faith meet a sad reward.\r\n  And if he swear he loves thee, laugh!\r\n  For give him thy little finger half,\r\n  And the iron chains of his stern control\r\n  Will sink like fire on thy poor soul!'\r\n\r\n  Now VICTOR heard all this, one day,\r\n  And smiled--'It's queer how men can say\r\n    Such things to injure their neighbors!\r\n  For do but look at this wonderful man,\r\n  So rich in thought, so fertile in plan,\r\n  Who, to place all tyranny under ban,\r\n    Never remits his labors,--\r\n  This dear, good soul, who, with magical art,\r\n  Brings freedom and peace to my trembling heart.'\r\n\r\n  Soon after, Sir LOUIS rode over the moor:\r\n  'My VICTOR, how comes it you're still so poor,\r\n    When I have paid all your debts, sir?\r\n  I've made you so rich, I've made you so great;\r\n  I've brought you gifts of money and plate;\r\n  Is there anything more to complete your state,\r\n    That you'd like to have, _I_ can get, sir?\r\n  Come, VICTOR, confess to your faithful friend,\r\n  Who to make you happy his honor would lend.'\r\n\r\n  'Oh, worthy man,--my tower and strength!\r\n  How sweet it is that I may, at length,\r\n    Confide in you as a brother!'\r\n  'Yes, take what you will, my statesman hold,\r\n  Only ask not whence comes the shining gold.\r\n  Just see what a beauty here I hold;\r\n    If you're good I may bring you another!--\r\n  A crown so rich in costly gems\r\n  It will match the Eastern diadems!'\r\n\r\n  Little VICTOR gazed at the sparkling crown,\r\n  Then fell at the feet of his LOUIS down,\r\n    Overcome by deep emotion.\r\n  'Oh! oh! is it true? is it all for me?\r\n  This beautiful crown, with its diamonds _three?_\r\n  And he clapped his hands in boundless glee,\r\n    And vowed eternal devotion;\r\n  While LOUIS looked on with a happy heart,\r\n  And blessed himself for his consummate art.\r\n\r\n  'Yes, VICTOR,' he said, 'it gives me joy\r\n  To present you, to-day, with this pretty toy,\r\n    With such freedom from envy or rancor!\r\n  But get up from your knees; 'tisn't quite orthodox\r\n  To kneel to a man; you might get on the rocks\r\n    Of his HOLINESS' anger.\r\n  Now lay the crown in your jewel-box,\r\n  And, lest some wandering, cunning fox\r\n  Should steal it, be sure to secure the locks.'\r\n\r\n  'Oh, a friend in need is a friend indeed!'\r\n  Quoth VICTOR; 'but this is beyond my meed.\r\n    And what gift of mine can repay you?'\r\n  'The key of the casket, friend, if you please,\r\n  I will take to my safe beyond the seas.\r\n  Your grateful heart will thus rest at ease;\r\n    So give it to me, I pray you.'\r\n  But VICTOR'S eyes grew large with fright,\r\n  And he cried, 'Oh, LOUIS! this can't be right;\r\n  For how can I get of my jewels a sight?\r\n    You might as well take them away too.'\r\n  'Give me the key!' screamed his guardian angel,\r\n  'Or receive the curse of the LORD'S evangel!'\r\n\r\n  Poor VICTOR trembled with fear and pain,\r\n  When he found his entreaties were all in vain,\r\n    And the key was lost forever.\r\n  Alas, alas for the counsel scorned;\r\n  For the jewels hid and the freedom mourned.\r\n    And the faith returning never!\r\n  For link after link of the adamant chain\r\n  Mounted endless guard over heart and brain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe London _Times_ of Dec. 12 contained the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     Blind indeed must be the fury of the Americans if they can\r\n     voluntarily superadd a war with this country to their present\r\n     overwhelming embarrassments. It is clear, notwithstanding the\r\n     sanguine spirit in which small successes are regarded, that the\r\n     Federal Government is making no material progress in the war.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, 'We have you at disadvantage. Now is our time to strike.\r\nA year ago we might have been afraid, but not now.' When John Bull is\r\nnext cited as the standard authority for fair play, let his very manly\r\nvaunts at this time be quoted in illustration!\r\n\r\nUp through the misty medium of 'News from the South' have struggled of\r\nlate divers rumors to the effect that the triumphant HOLLINS, of Steam\r\nRam and Greytown memory, has been somewhat shorn of his 'lorrels.' How\r\nhis stock fell below par is solemnly narrated in the second and\r\nfollowing instalment of our' Chronicles:'--\r\n\r\n  CHRONICLES OF SECESSIA.\r\n\r\n  BOOK II.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a man and his name was HOLLINS.\r\n\r\nHe was of those that go down to the sea in ships, and sometimes across\r\nthe bay in very different conveyances.\r\n\r\nBold of speech, with a face like unto a brazen idol of Gath, and a voice\r\neven as a bull of Bashan; a man such as Gog and Magog, and ever agog for\r\nto be praised of men, or any other man.\r\n\r\nNow this HOLLINS was greatly esteemed of the South, howbeit he was held\r\nof but little worth in the North, since they who made songs and jokes\r\nfor the papers had aforetime laughed him to scorn.\r\n\r\nFor it had come to pass that sundry niggers, the children of Ham, with\r\nothers of the heathen, walking in darkness, had built unto themselves\r\nshanties of sticks and mud, and dwellings of palm-leaves, and given unto\r\nthe place a name; even Greytown called they it;\r\n\r\nAnd, waxing saucy, had reviled the powers that be, and chosen unto\r\nthemselves a king, wearing pantaloons.\r\n\r\nAnd HOLLINS said unto himself, 'Lo! here is glory!\r\n\r\n'Verily here be niggers who are not men of war, strength is not in them,\r\nand their habitations are as naught.'\r\n\r\nSo he went against them with cannon and sailors, men of war and\r\nhorse-marines, and made war upon the children of Ham,\r\n\r\nBombarding their town from the rising of the sun even unto the going\r\ndown of the same--there was not left one old woman there, no, not one.\r\n\r\nNow when the men of the South, and they which dwell in the isles of the\r\nsea, with those of the uplands,\r\n\r\nHeard that HOLLINS had battered down the cabins of the niggers and slain\r\ntheir hens,\r\n\r\nThen they said, 'This is a great man, and no abolitionist.'\r\n\r\nAnd his fame went abroad into all lands, and they made a feast for him,\r\nwhere they sung aloud, merrily,\r\n\r\n'We will not go home, no, not until the morning.\r\n\r\n'Until the dayspring shineth we will not repair unto our dwellings.\r\n\r\n'Advance rapidly in the days of thy youth,\r\n\r\n'For it will come to pass that in thy declining years it will not be\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n'Let the tongue of scandal be silent, and let the foot of dull care be\r\nno longer in our dwelling.\r\n\r\n'It was in the centre of the Boomjalang, even on a summer day did it\r\ncome to pass,--rip snap, let her be again exalted!\r\n\r\n'Now let all the elders who are not wedded, even they that are without\r\nwives, fill up the goblet, and let those who are assembled live for many\r\nyears!\r\n\r\n'Let them drink each unto the handmaid of his heart. May we live for\r\nmany years!\r\n\r\n'_Vive l'amour, vive le vin, vive la compagnie!_\r\n\r\n'We will dance through the hours of darkness to the dayspring, and\r\nreturn with the damsels, even unto their dwellings.\r\n\r\n'There was a man named JOHN BROWN; he owned a little one and it was an\r\nIndian, yea, two Indian boys were among his heritage.\r\n\r\n'The ten spot taketh the nine, but is itself taken by the ace, and since\r\nwe are here assembled let us drink!\r\n\r\n'I will advance on my charger all night, even by day will I not tarry;\r\nlo! I have wagered my shekels on the steed with a shortened tail; who\r\nwill stake his gold on the bay?\r\n\r\n'Great was COCK ROBIN, and JAMES BUCHANAN was not small, neither is\r\nWIKOFF,\r\n\r\n'But greater than all is HOLLINS,--who shall prevail against him?'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days of war, even after the South had seceded,\r\n\r\nWhen the arrows of the North were pointed, and the strong men had gone\r\nforth unto battle;\r\n\r\nWhen the ships had closed up the ports of the great cities, and their\r\nmarts were desolate;\r\n\r\nWhen the damsels that had aforetime walked in fine linen and purple, and\r\nprecious stones, were clad in homespun and went to indigenous parties;\r\nWhen the Mississippi was blockaded by the Preble and Vincennes, and many\r\nmore and several such;\r\n\r\nThen HOLLINS got himself ready for battle: with great boasting and\r\nmighty words did he gird on his armor,\r\n\r\nSaying, 'Be not afraid, it is I who will unfold the terrors of my wrath;\r\nthe Yankees shall utterly wither away, their ships will I burn, and\r\ntheir captains will I take captive, in a highly extra manner.\r\n\r\n'Did I not burn Greytown? was it not I who made the niggers run? who\r\nshall stand before me?'\r\n\r\nNow they had made a thing which they called a steam-ram, an iron-covered\r\nboat, like unto a serpent, even like unto the evil beast which crawleth\r\nupon its belly, eating dirt, as do many of those who made it.\r\n\r\nAnd all the South rejoiced over it, the voices of many editors were\r\nuplifted,\r\n\r\nAccording to the Revised Statutes,\r\n\r\nProphesying sure death and sudden ruin, on back action principles.\r\n\r\nYea, there were those who opined that the ram would suffice to destroy\r\nthe whole North, or at least its navy--there or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nAnd they cried aloud that the rams of Jericho were nowhere, and that the\r\ngreat ram of Derby, was but as a ramlet compared to this.\r\n\r\nAnd the reporters of the _Crescent_ and _Bee_, and _Delta_, and\r\n_Picayune_, and they of the kangaroon Creole French press, went to see\r\nit,\r\n\r\nAnd returned with their eyes greatly enlarged, so that they seemed as\r\nthose of the fish men take from a mile depth in the Gulf of Nice,--which\r\nare excessively magnocular,--even as large as the round tower of\r\nCopenhagen were their optics,\r\n\r\nDeclaring that on the face of the earth was no such marvel as the ram;\r\nthe wonderful wonder of wonders did it seem unto them; sharp death at\r\nshort notice on craft of all sizes.\r\n\r\nThen HOLLINS got unto himself divers tugs and clam-boats, ferry-boats,\r\nand one or two larger craft, which thieves had stolen privily aforetime\r\nfrom the government,\r\n\r\nFor in that land all was done in those days by stealing; pilfering and\r\nrobbing were among them from the beginning.\r\n\r\nAnd he went forth to battle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it was about the middle of the third watch of the night,\r\n\r\nCame a messenger bearing good tidings unto the Philistines, even unto\r\nthe Pelicans and Swampers of New Orleans,\r\n\r\nSaying, 'He has done it, well he has. _C'est un fait accompli_.'\r\n\r\nThen got they all together in great joy, crying aloud, '_Vive_\r\nHollane!--hurrah for Hollins! _viva el adelantado!_ Massa Hollums fur\r\nebber! _Der_ Hollins _soll leben!_ Go it, old Haulins! _Evviva il\r\ncapitano_ Hollino! Hip, hip, hurroo, ye divils, for Hollins!'\r\n\r\nThen there stood up in the high place one bearing a dispatch, which was\r\nopened, the words whereof read he unto them:\r\n\r\n[THE DISPATCH.]\r\n\r\n'I have peppered them.\r\n\r\n'Peppered, peppered, peppered, peppepa-peppered them.\r\n\r\n'Pip, pap, pep, pop, pup-uppered 'em.\r\n\r\n'I drove 'em all before me--glory, g'lang; knocked 'em higher 'n a kite\r\nand peppered 'em.\r\n\r\n'I sunk the Preble, and the Vincennes did I send to thunder. I peppered\r\n'em.\r\n\r\n'The ram has rammed everything to pieces, and the rest did I drive high\r\nand dry ashore, where I peppered 'em.\r\n\r\n'What was left did my ships destroy; verily I peppered 'em.\r\n\r\n'The residue thereof, lo! was it not burnt up by my fire-ships?--yea,\r\nthey were peppered.\r\n\r\n'The remainder I am even now peppering, and the others will I continue\r\nto pepper.\r\n\r\n'Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers--even so did I--such a\r\npeppering never yet was seen, neither aforetime, or aftertime, not in\r\nthe land where the pepper grows, or any other time.\r\n\r\n'I peppered 'em.'\r\n\r\nAnd lo! when this was read there arose such a cry of joy as never was\r\nheard, no, not at the Tower of Babel on Saturday night.\r\n\r\nAnd he who read, said: 'Rome was redeemed for a thousand pounds of\r\npepper and a thousand of gold, pound for pound did they weigh it out.\r\nBut such pepper as this is beyond price--yea, beyond all gold.\r\n\r\n'But what are they whom he has conquered, oh my soul? Dirt and Iniquity\r\nis their name, evil are their ways, cuss and confound them!\r\n\r\n'It was not worth the while for a gentleman to fight such\r\nscallawags--behold, a blind nigger in a mud-scow could have put them to\r\nflight--even a blind nigger should we have sent against them.\r\n\r\n'Great and glorious is HOLLINS, splendid is his fame, great is his\r\nvictory, beyond all those of the Meads and Prussians, Cherrynea and\r\nChepultapec, Thermopilus and Vagrom.'\r\n\r\nThen it was telegrammed all over the South, and the rest of mankind,\r\nthat HOLLINS had peppered the fleet, and pulverized the last particle\r\nthereof into small-sized annihilation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut on the evening of the first day there came yet other tidings of a\r\nreactive character,\r\n\r\nSaying that a confounded abolitionist man-of-war was still there giving\r\nblock-aid to Uncle Sam.\r\n\r\nAnd HOLLINS, who was in town, being asked what this might mean,\r\n\r\nSaid, 'Fudge!\r\n\r\n'Go to, it is naught. Now I come to think of it, there _was_ one\r\ninfernal little sneaking 90-gun Yankee frigate,\r\n\r\n'Which, hearing of my coming, ran away six hours before the battle--ere\r\nthat I had peppered 'em.'\r\n\r\nBut lo! even as he spake came yet another message, declaring there were\r\ntwain.\r\n\r\nThen HOLLINS declared, 'It is a d----d lie, and he who says it is\r\nanother--an abolitionist is he in his heart. Did I not pepper 'em?'\r\n\r\nBut lo, even as he sware there came yet another,\r\n\r\nSaying, 'Let not my lord be angry, but with these eyes have I seen it;\r\nby many others was it perceived.\r\n\r\n'Whether the ships which my lord peppered have risen again I know not,\r\nbut if the whole Yankee fleet isn't there again, all sound and right\r\nside up with care, I hope I may be drotted into everlasting turpentine.'\r\n\r\nThen the newspapers arose and reviled HOLLINS,\r\n\r\nCalling him a humbug--even a humbug called they him.\r\n\r\nAs for the multitude, they laughed him to scorn; such a blackguarding\r\nnever received man before,\r\n\r\nCalling him an old blower and bloat, a gas-bag and _fanfaron_, a Gascon\r\nand a _carajo_, _alma miserabile_, and a pudding-head, a _sacre menteur_\r\nand a _verfluchte prahlerische Hauptesel_, a brassy old blunder-head and\r\na spupsy, _un sot sans pareil_ and a darned old hoffmagander; a\r\npepper-_pot-pourri_, a thafe of the wurreld and an owld baste, the\r\ndivil's blissing an him!\r\n\r\nIn French, English, Dutch, Spanish and Irish, Yankee and Creole, yea,\r\neven in Nigger and in Natchez Indian, reviled they him.\r\n\r\nAnd the rumor thereof went abroad into all lands, that HOLLINS had been\r\ncompelled to hand in his horns.\r\n\r\nHow are the mighty fallen, how is he that was exalted cut down in his\r\nsalary!\r\n\r\nBeware, oh my son, that thou pullest not the long bow ere the bowstring\r\nbe twisted, or ever the arrow be at hand--send not in thy bill ere the\r\ncustomer have bought the goods.\r\n\r\nSell not the skin ere thou catchest the bear, and give not out thy\r\nwedding cards before thou hast popped the question.\r\n\r\nFor all these things did HOLLINS--verily he hath his reward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER NORTH, in _Blackwood_, and many others since him, have\r\npopularized this style of chronicle-English of the sixteenth century,\r\nand our contributor has sound precedent for his imitations.

Who has not\r\nheard of mistakes which have occurred owing to their frequency and\r\nsimilarity, and who in fact has not lost one himself? That these\r\nmistakes may sometimes lead to merrily-moving, serio-comic results, is\r\nset forth, not badly, as it seems to us, in the following story:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THREE TRAVELLING-BAGS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were three of them, all of shining black leather: one on top of\r\nthe pile of trunks; one on the ground; one in the owner's hand;--all\r\ngoing to Philadelphia; all waiting to be checked.\r\n\r\nThe last bell rang. The baggageman bustled, fuming, from one pile of\r\nbaggage to another, dispensing chalk to the trunks, checks to the\r\npassengers, and curses to the porters, in approved railway style.\r\n\r\n'Mine!--Philadelphia!' cried a stout, military-looking man, with\r\nenormous whiskers and a red face, crowding forward, as the baggageman\r\nlaid his hand on the first bag.\r\n\r\n'Won't you please to give me a check for this, now?' entreated a pale,\r\nslender, carefully-dressed young man, for the ninth time, holding out\r\nbag No. 2. 'I have a lady to look after.'\r\n\r\n'Say! be you agoin' to give me a check for that 'are, or not?' growled\r\nthe proprietor of bag No. 3, a short, pockmarked fellow, in a shabby\r\novercoat.\r\n\r\n'All right, gen'l'men. Here you are,' says the functionary, rapidly\r\ndistributing the three checks. 'Philadelfy, this? Yes,\r\nsir,--1092--1740.11--1020. All right.'\r\n\r\n'All aboard!' shouted the conductor.\r\n\r\n'Whoo-whew!' responded the locomotive; and the train moved slowly out of\r\nthe station-house.\r\n\r\nThe baggageman meditatively watched it, as it sped away in the distance,\r\nand then, as if a thought suddenly struck him, slapping his thigh, he\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n'Blest if I don't believe--'\r\n\r\n'What?' inquired the switchman.\r\n\r\n'That I've gone and guv them three last fellers the wrong checks! The\r\ncussed little black things was all alike, and they bothered me.'\r\n\r\n'Telegraph,' suggested the switchman.\r\n\r\n'Never you mind,' replied the baggageman. 'They was all going to\r\nPhiladelfy. They'll find it out when they get there.'\r\n\r\nThey did.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scene shifts to the Continental Hotel, Philadelphia.--Front parlor,\r\nup stairs.--Occupants, the young gentleman alluded to in Chapter I., and\r\na young lady. In accordance with the fast usages of the times, the twain\r\nhad been made one in holy matrimony at 7.30 A.M.; duly kissed and\r\ncongratulated till 8.15; put aboard the express train at 8.45, and\r\ndeposited at the Continental, bag and baggage, by 12.58.\r\n\r\nThey were seated on the sofa, the black broadcloth coat-sleeve\r\nencircling the slender waist of the gray traveling-dress, and the jetty\r\nmoustache in equally affectionate proximity to the glossy curls.\r\n\r\n'Are you tired, dearest?'\r\n\r\n'No, love, not much. But you are, arn't you?'\r\n\r\n'No, darling.'\r\n\r\nKiss, and a pause.\r\n\r\n'Don't it seem funny?' said the lady.\r\n\r\n'What, love?'\r\n\r\n'That we should be married.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, darling.'\r\n\r\n'Won't they be glad to see us at George's?'\r\n\r\n'Of course they will.'\r\n\r\n'I'm sure I shall enjoy it so much. Shall we get there to-night?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, love, if--'\r\n\r\nRap-rap-rap, at the door.\r\n\r\nA hasty separation took place between man and wife--to opposite ends of\r\nthe sofa; and then--\r\n\r\n'Come in.'\r\n\r\n'Av ye plaze, sur, it's an M.P. is waiting to see yez.'\r\n\r\n'To see _me_! A policeman?'\r\n\r\n'Yis, sur.'\r\n\r\n'There must be some mistake.'\r\n\r\n'No, sur, it's yourself; and he's waiting in the hall, beyant.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll go to--No, tell him to come here.'\r\n\r\n'Sorry to disturb you, sir,' said the M.P., with a huge brass star on\r\nhis breast, appearing with great alacrity at the waiter's elbow.\r\n'B'lieve this is your black valise?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, that is ours, certainly. It has Julia's--the lady's things in it.'\r\n\r\n'Suspicious sarcumstances about that 'ere valise, sir. Telegraph come\r\nthis morning that a burglar started on the 8.45 Philadelphia train,\r\nwith a lot of stolen spoons, in a black valise.--Spoons marked\r\nT.B.--Watched at the Ferry.--Saw the black valise.--Followed it up\r\nhere.--Took a peek inside. Sure enough, there was the spoons. Marked\r\nT.B., too. Said it was yours. Shall have to take you in charge.'\r\n\r\n'Take _me_ in charge!' echoed the dismayed bridegroom. 'But I assure\r\nyou, my dear sir, there is some strange mistake. It's all a mistake.'\r\n\r\n'S'pose you'll be able to account for the spoons being in your valise,\r\nthen?'\r\n\r\n'Why, I--I--it isn't mine. It must be somebody else's. Somebody's put\r\nthem there. It is some villanous conspiracy.'\r\n\r\n'Hope you'll be able to tell a straighter story before the magistrate,\r\nyoung man; 'cause if you don't, you stand a smart chance of being sent\r\nup for six months.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Charles! this is horrid. Do send him away. Oh dear! I wish I was\r\nhome,' sobbed the little bride.\r\n\r\n'I tell you, sir,' said the bridegroom, bristling up with indignation,\r\n'this is all a vile plot. What would I be doing with your paltry spoons?\r\nI was married this morning, in Fifth Avenue, and I am on my wedding\r\ntour. I have high connections in New York. You'll repent it, sir, if you\r\ndare to arrest me.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, come, now,' said the incredulous official, 'I've hearn stories like\r\nthat before. This ain't the first time swindlers has traveled in\r\ncouples. Do you s'pose I don't know nothin'? 'Tan't no use; you've just\r\ngot to come along to the station-house. Might as well go peaceably,\r\n'cause you'll have to.'\r\n\r\n'Charles, this is perfectly dreadful! Our wedding night in the\r\nstation-house! Do send for somebody. Send for the landlord to explain\r\nit.'\r\n\r\nThe landlord was sent for, and came; the porters were sent for, and\r\ncame; the waiters, and chambermaids, and bar-room loungers came, without\r\nbeing sent for, and filled the room and the adjoining hall,--some to\r\nlaugh, some to say they wouldn't have believed it, but nearly all to\r\nexult that the unhappy pair had been 'found out.' No explanation could\r\nbe given; and the upshot was, that, in spite of tears, threats,\r\nentreaties, rage, and expostulations, the unfortunate newly-married pair\r\nwere taken in charge by the relentless policeman, and marched down\r\nstairs, _en route_ for the police office.\r\n\r\nAnd here let the curtain drop on the melancholy scene, while we follow\r\nthe fortunes of black valise No. 2.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the train stopped at Camden, four gentlemen got off, and walked,\r\narm-in-arm, rapidly and silently, up one of the by-streets, and struck\r\noff into a foot-path leading to a secluded grove outside the town. Of\r\nthe first two, one was our military friend in a blue coat, apparently\r\nthe leader of the party. Of the second two, one was a smiling, rosy\r\nlittle man, carrying a black valise. Their respective companions walked\r\nwith hasty, irregular strides, were abstracted, and--apparently ill at\r\nease.\r\n\r\nThe party stopped.\r\n\r\n'This is the place,' said Captain Jones.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Doctor Smith.\r\n\r\nThe Captain and the Doctor conferred together. The other two studiously\r\nkept apart.\r\n\r\n'Very well. I'll measure the ground, and do you place your man.'\r\n\r\nIt was done.\r\n\r\n'Now for the pistols,' whispered the Captain to his fellow-second.\r\n\r\n'They are all ready, in the valise,' replied the Doctor.\r\n\r\nThe principals were placed, ten paces apart, and wearing that decidedly\r\nuncomfortable air a man has who is in momentary expectation of being\r\nshot.\r\n\r\n'You will fire, gentlemen, simultaneously, when I give the word,' said\r\nthe Captain. Then, in an undertone, to the Doctor, 'Quick, the pistols.'\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, stooping over and fumbling at the valise, appeared to find\r\nsomething that surprised him.\r\n\r\n'Why, what the devil--'\r\n\r\n'What's the matter?' asked the Captain, striding up. 'Can't you find the\r\ncaps?'\r\n\r\n'Deuce a pistol or cap, but this!'\r\n\r\nHe held up--a lady's night-cap!\r\n\r\n'Look here--and here--and here!'--holding up successively a hair-brush,\r\na long, white night-gown, a cologne-bottle, and a comb.\r\n\r\nThey were greeted with a long whistle by the Captain, and a blank stare\r\nby the two principals.\r\n\r\n'Confound the luck!' ejaculated the Captain; 'if we haven't made a\r\nmistake, and brought the wrong valise!'\r\n\r\nThe principals looked at the seconds. The seconds looked at the\r\nprincipals. Nobody volunteered a suggestion. At last the Doctor\r\ninquired,\r\n\r\n'Well, what's to be done?'\r\n\r\n'D----d unlucky!' again ejaculated the Captain. 'The duel can't go on.'\r\n\r\n'Evidently not,' responded the Doctor, 'unless they brain each other\r\nwith the hair-brush, or take a pop at each other with the\r\ncologne-bottle.'\r\n\r\n'You are quite sure there are no pistols in the valise?' said one of the\r\nprincipals, with suppressed eagerness, and drawing a long breath of\r\nevident relief.\r\n\r\n'We might go over to the city and get pistols,' proposed the Captain.\r\n\r\n'And by that time it will he dark,' said the Doctor.\r\n\r\n'D----d unlucky,' said the Captain again.\r\n\r\n'We shall be the laughing-stock of the town,' consolingly remarked the\r\nDoctor, 'if this gets wind.'\r\n\r\n'One word with you, Doctor,' here interposed his principal.\r\n\r\nThey conferred.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the conference with his principal, the Doctor, advancing\r\nto the Captain, conferred with him. Then the Captain conferred with his\r\nprincipal. Then the seconds conferred with each other. Finally, it was\r\nformally agreed between the contending parties that a statement should\r\nbe drawn up in writing, whereby Principal No. 1 tendered the assurance\r\nthat the offensive words 'You are a liar' were not used by him in any\r\npersonal sense, but solely as an abstract proposition, in a general way,\r\nin regard to the matter of fact under dispute. To which Principal No. 2\r\nappended his statement of his high gratification at this candid and\r\nhonorable explanation, and unqualifiedly withdrew the offensive words\r\n'You are a scoundrel,' they having been used by him under a\r\nmisapprehension of the intent and purpose of the remark which preceded\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere being no longer a cause of quarrel, the duel was of course ended.\r\nThe principals shook hands, first with each other, and next with the\r\nseconds, and were evidently very glad to get out of it.\r\n\r\n'And now that it is so happily settled,' said the Doctor, chuckling and\r\nrubbing his hands, 'it proves to have been a lucky mistake, after all,\r\nthat we brought the wrong valise. Wonder what the lady that owns it will\r\nsay when she opens ours and finds the pistols.'\r\n\r\n'Very well for you to laugh about,' growled the Captain; 'but it's no\r\njoke for me to lose my pistols. Hair triggers--best English make, and\r\ngold mounted. There arn't a finer pair in America.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, we'll find 'em. We'll go on a pilgrimage from house to house,\r\nasking if any lady there has lost a night-cap and found a pair of\r\ndueling-pistols.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn very good spirits, the party crossed the river, and inquired at the\r\nbaggage-room in reference to each and all black leather traveling-bags\r\narrived that day, took notes of where they were sent, and set out to\r\nfollow them up. In due time they reached the Continental, and, as luck\r\nwould have it, met the unhappy bridal pair just coming down stairs in\r\ncharge of the policeman.\r\n\r\n'What's all this?' inquired the Captain.\r\n\r\n'Oh, a couple of burglars, caught with a valise full of stolen\r\nproperty.'\r\n\r\n'A valise!--what kind of a valise?'\r\n\r\n'A black leather valise. That's it, there.'\r\n\r\n'Here!--Stop!--Hallo!--Policeman!--Landlord! It's all right. You're all\r\nwrong. That's my valise. It's all a mistake. They got changed at the\r\ndepot. This lady and gentleman are innocent. Here's their valise, with\r\nher night-cap in it.'\r\n\r\nGreat was the laughter, multifarious the comments, and deep the interest\r\nof the crowd in all this dialogue, which they appeared to regard as a\r\ndelightful entertainment, got up expressly for their amusement.\r\n\r\n'Then you say this 'ere is yourn?' said the policeman, relaxing his hold\r\non the bridegroom, and confronting the Captain.\r\n\r\n'Yes, it's mine.'\r\n\r\n'And how did you come by the spoons?'\r\n\r\n'Spoons, you jackanapes!' said the Captain. 'Pistols!--dueling-pistols!'\r\n\r\n'Do you call these pistols?' said the policeman, holding up one of the\r\nsilver spoons marked 'T.B.'\r\n\r\nThe Captain, astounded, gasped, 'It's the wrong valise again, after\r\nall!'\r\n\r\n'Stop! Not so fast!' said the police functionary, now invested with\r\ngreat dignity by the importance of the affair he found himself engaged\r\nin. 'If so be as how you've got this 'ere lady's valise, she's all\r\nright, and can go. But, in that case, this is yourn, and it comes on you\r\nto account for them 'are stole spoons. Have to take _you_ in charge, all\r\nfour of ye.'\r\n\r\n'Why, you impudent scoundrel!' roared the Captain; 'I'll see you in\r\n----. I wish I had my pistols here; I'd teach you how to insult\r\ngentlemen!'--shaking his fist.\r\n\r\nThe dispute waxed fast and furious. The outsiders began to take part in\r\nit, and there is no telling how it would have ended, had not an\r\nexplosion, followed by a heavy fall and a scream of pain, been heard in\r\nan adjoining room.\r\n\r\nThe crowd rushed to the scene of the new attraction.\r\n\r\nThe door was fast. It was soon burst open, and the mystery explained.\r\nThe thief, who had carried off the Captain's valise by mistake for his\r\nown, had taken it up to his room, and opened it to gloat over the booty\r\nhe supposed it to contain, thrusting his hand in after the spoons. In so\r\ndoing he had touched one of the hair triggers, and the pistol had gone\r\noff, the bullet making a round hole through the side of the valise, and\r\na corresponding round hole in the calf of his leg.\r\n\r\nThe wounded rascal was taken in charge, first by the policeman, and then\r\nby the doctor; and the duelists and the wedded pair struck up a\r\nfriendship on the score of their mutual mishaps, which culminated in a\r\nsupper, where the fun was abundant, and where it would he hard to say\r\nwhich was in the best spirits,--the Captain for recovering his pistols,\r\nthe bride for getting her night-cap, the bridegroom for escaping the\r\nstation-house, or the duelists for escaping each other. All resolved to\r\n'mark that day with a white stone,' and henceforth to mark their names\r\non their black traveling-bags, in white letters.\r\n\r\nMORAL.--Go thou and do likewise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy odd coincidence, this is not the only 'tale of a traveler' and of a\r\nsmall carpet-bag in this our present number. The reader will find\r\nanother, but of a tragic cast, in the 'Tints and Tones of Paris' among\r\nour foregoing pages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are errors and errors, as the French say. The following is not\r\nwithout a foundation in fact:--\r\n\r\nTHACKERAY'S young lady, who abused a gentleman for associating with low,\r\nradical literary friends, must have had about as elevated an opinion of\r\nliterature as an Irishman I lately heard of had of the medical\r\nprofession, as represented by its non-commissioned officers.\r\n\r\nMy friend BOB handed his man-servant some books, to return to the\r\nFranklin Library. Noticing, a few minutes afterwards, while passing\r\nthrough the hall, that he was busy carefully wrapping them up in\r\nnewspaper, he asked him what he was doing that for.\r\n\r\n'Och, shure, Mister ----, I'm afraid, if they say me carr'ing books\r\nrouhnd undher me ahrm, they'll be afther tayking me for a _maydical\r\nstudent_!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe very remarkable and enthusiastic welcome which has been extended to\r\nour proposal to establish the CONTINENTAL as an _independent_ magazine,\r\ncalls for the warmest gratitude from us, and at the same time induces us\r\nto lay stress upon the fact that our pages are open to contributions of\r\na very varied character; the only condition being that they shall be\r\nwritten by friends of the Union. While holding firmly to our own views\r\nas set forth under the 'Editorial' heading, _we by no means profess to\r\nendorse those of our contributors_, leaving the reader to make his own\r\ncomments on these. In a word, we shall adopt such elements of\r\n_independent_ action as have been hitherto characteristic of the\r\nnewspaper press, but which we judge to be quite as suitable to a monthly\r\nmagazine. We offer a fair field and _all_ favors to all comers, avoiding\r\nall petty jealousies and exclusiveness. Will our readers please to bear\r\nthis in mind in reading all articles published in our pages?\r\n\r\nWe can not conclude without expressing the warmest gratitude to the\r\npress and the public for the comment, commendation and patronage which\r\nthey have so liberally bestowed upon us. We have been obliged to print\r\nthree times the number for which we had anticipated sale, and believe\r\nthat no American magazine ever circulated so many copies of a first\r\nnumber. In consequence of this demand we have been compelled to go to\r\npress earlier than was anticipated. Articles promised for February, by\r\nMessrs. BAYARD TAYLOR and CHARLES F. BROWNE, but not yet received, are\r\nnecessarily deferred. From the latter gentleman we have a note promising\r\na positive appearance in March.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE KNICKERBOCKER\r\n\r\nFOR 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the last year, when its present proprietors assumed\r\ncontrol of the Knickerbocker, they announced their determination to\r\nspare no pains to place it in its true position as the leading\r\n_literary_ Monthly in America. When rebellion had raided a successful\r\nfront, and its armies threatened the very existence of the Republic, it\r\nwas impossible to permit a magazine, which in its circulation reached\r\nthe best intellects in the land, to remain insensible or indifferent to\r\nthe dangers which threatened the Union. The proprietors accordingly gave\r\nnotice, that it would present in its pages, forcible expositions with\r\nregard to the great question of the times,--_how to preserve the_ UNITED\r\nSTATES OF AMERICA _in their integrity and unity_. How far this pledge\r\nhas been redeemed the public must judge. It would, however, be mere\r\naffectation to ignore the seal of approbation which has been placed on\r\nthese efforts. The proprietors gratefully acknowledge this, and it has\r\nled them to embark in a fresh undertaking, as already announced,--the\r\npublication of the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY, devoted to Literature and\r\nNational Policy; in which magazine, those who have sympathized with the\r\npolitical opinions recently set forth in the KNICKERBOCKER, will find\r\nthe same views more fully enforced and maintained by the ablest and most\r\nenergetic minds in America.\r\n\r\nThe KNICKERBOCKER, while it will continue firmly pledged to the cause of\r\nthe Union, will henceforth be more earnestly devoted to literature, and\r\nwill leave no effort untried to attain the highest excellence in those\r\ndepartments of letters which it has adopted as specialties.\r\n\r\nThe January number commences its thirtieth year. With such antecedents\r\nas it possesses, it seems unnecessary to make any especial pledges as to\r\nits future, but it may not be amiss to say that it will be the aim of\r\nits conductors to make it more and more deserving of the liberal support\r\nit has hitherto received. The same eminent writers who have contributed\r\nto it during the past year will continue to enrich its pages, and in\r\naddition, contributions will appear from others of the highest\r\nreputation, as well as from many rising authors. While it will, as\r\nheretofore, cultivate the genial and humorous, it will also pay\r\nassiduous attention to the higher departments of art and letters, and\r\ngive fresh and spirited articles on such biographical, historical,\r\nscientific, and general subjects as are of especial interest to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nIn the January issue will commence a series of papers by CHARLES GODFREY\r\nLELAND, entitled \"SUNSHINE IN LETTERS,\" which will be found interesting\r\nto scholars as well as to the general reader, and in an early number\r\nwill appear the first chapters of a NEW and INTERESTING NOVEL,\r\ndescriptive of American life and character.\r\n\r\nAccording to the unanimous opinion of the American press, the\r\nKNICKERBOCKER has been greatly improved during the past year, _and it is\r\ncertain that at no period of its long career did it ever attract more\r\nattention or approbation_. Confident of their enterprise and ability,\r\nthe proprietors are determined that it shall be still more eminent in\r\nexcellence, containing all that is best of the old, and being\r\ncontinually enlivened by what is most brilliant of the new.\r\n\r\nTERMS.--Three dollars a year, in advance. Two copies for Four Dollars\r\nand fifty cents. Three copies for Six dollars. Subscribers remitting\r\nThree Dollars will receive as a premium, (post-paid,) a copy of Richard\r\nB. Kimball's great work, \"THE REVELATIONS OF WALL STREET,\" to be\r\npublished by G.P. Putnam, early in February next, (price $1.)\r\nSubscribers remitting Four Dollars will receive the KNICKERBOCKER and\r\nthe CONTINENTAL MONTHLY for one year. As but one edition of each number\r\nof the Knickerbocker is printed, those desirous of commencing with the\r\nvolume should subscribe at once.\r\n\r\n[Symbol: Pointing Hand] The publisher, appreciating the importance of\r\nliterature to the soldier on duty, will send a copy _gratis_, during the\r\ncontinuance of the war, to any regiment in active service, on\r\napplication being made by its Colonel or Chaplain. Subscriptions will\r\nalso be received from those desiring it sent to soldiers in the ranks at\r\n_half price_, but in such cases it must be mailed from the office of\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nJ.R. GILMORE, 532 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\nC.T. EVANS, General Agent, 533 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\nAll communications and contributions, intended for the Editorial\r\ndepartment, should be addressed to CHARLES G. LELAND, Editor of the\r\n\"Knickerbocker,\" care of C.T. EVANS, 532 Broadway, New York.\r\n\r\nNewspapers copying the above and giving the Magazine monthly notices,\r\nwill be entitled to an exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPECTUS\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nThe Continental Monthly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are periods in the world's history marked by extraordinary and\r\nviolent crises, sudden as the breaking forth of & volcano, or the\r\nbursting of a storm on the ocean. These crises sweep away in a moment\r\nthe landmarks of generations. They call out fresh talent, and give to\r\nthe old a new direction. It is then that new ideas are born, new\r\ntheories developed. Such periods demand fresh exponents, and new men for\r\nexpounders.\r\n\r\nThis Continent has lately been convulsed by an upheaving so sudden and\r\nterrible that the relations of all men and women to each other are\r\nviolently disturbed, and people look about for the elements with which\r\nto sway the storm and direct the whirlwind. Just at present, we do not\r\nknow what all this is to bring forth; but we do know that great results\r\nMUST flow from such extraordinary commotions.\r\n\r\nAt a juncture so solemn and so important, there is a special need that\r\nthe intellectual force of the country should be active and efficient. It\r\nis a time for great minds to speak their thoughts boldly, and to take\r\nposition as the advance guard. To this end, there is a special want\r\nunsupplied. It is that of an Independent Magazine, which shall be open\r\nto the first intellects of the land, and which shall treat the issues\r\npresented, and to be presented to the country, in a tone no way tempered\r\nby partisanship, or influenced by fear, favor, or the hope of reward;\r\nwhich shall seize and grapple with the momentous subjects that the\r\npresent disturbed state of affairs heave to the surface, and which CAN\r\nNOT be laid aside or neglected.\r\n\r\nTo meet this want, the undersigned have commenced, under the editorial\r\ncharge of CHARLES GODFREY LELAND, the publication of a new magazine,\r\ndevoted to Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\nIn POLITICS, it will advocate, with all the for command, measures best\r\nadapted to preserve the oneness and integrity of these United States. It\r\nwill never yield to the idea of any disruption of the Republic,\r\npeaceably or otherwise; and it will discuss with honesty and\r\nimpartiality what must be done to save it. In this department, some of\r\nthe most eminent statesmen of the time will contribute regularly to its\r\npages.\r\n\r\nIn LITERATURE, it will be sustained by the best writers and ablest\r\nthinkers of this country.\r\n\r\nAmong its attractions will be presented, in an early number, a NEW\r\nSERIAL of American Life, by RICHARD B. KIMBALL, ESQ., the very popular\r\nauthor of \"The Revelations of Wall Street,\" \"St. Leger,\" &c. A series of\r\npapers by HON. HORACE GREELEY, embodying the distinguished author's\r\nobservations on the growth and development of the Great West. A series\r\nof articles by the author of \"Through the Cotton States,\" containing the\r\nresult of an extended tour in the seaboard Slave States, just prior to\r\nthe breaking out of the war, and presenting a startling and truthful\r\npicture of the real condition of that region. No pains will be spared to\r\nrender the literary attractions of the CONTINENTAL both brilliant and\r\nsubstantial. The lyrical or descriptive talents of the most eminent\r\n_literati_ have been promised to its pages; and nothing will be admitted\r\nwhich will not be distinguished by marked energy, originality, and solid\r\nstrength. Avoiding every influence or association partaking of clique or\r\ncoterie, it will be open to all contributions of real merit, even from\r\nwriters differing materially in their views; the only limitation\r\nrequired being that of devotion to the Union, and the only standard of\r\nacceptance that of intrinsic excellence.\r\n\r\nThe EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT will embrace, in addition to vigorous and\r\nfearless comments on the events of the times, genial gossip with the\r\nreader on all current topics, and also devote abundant space to those\r\nracy specimens of American wit and humor, without which there can be no\r\nperfect exposition of our national character. Among those who will\r\ncontribute regularly to this department may be mentioned the name of\r\nCHARLES F. BROWNE (\"Artemus Ward\"), from whom we shall present in the\r\nMARCH number, the first of an entirely new and original series of\r\nSKETCHES OF WESTERN LIFE.\r\n\r\nThe CONTINENTAL will be liberal and progressive, without yielding to\r\nchimeras and hopes beyond the grasp of the age; and it will endeavor to\r\nreflect the feelings and the interests of the American people, and to\r\nillustrate both their serious and humorous peculiarities. In short, no\r\npains will be spared to make it the REPRESENTATIVE MAGAZINE of the time.\r\n\r\nTERMS:--Three Dollars per year, in advance (postage paid by the\r\nPublishers;) Two Copies for Five Dollars; Three Copies for Six Dollars,\r\n(postage unpaid); Eleven copies for Twenty Dollars, (postage unpaid).\r\nSingle numbers can be procured of any News-dealer in the United States.\r\nThe KNICKERBOCKER MAGAZINE and the CONTINENTAL MONTHLY will be furnished\r\nfor one year at FOUR DOLLARS.\r\n\r\nAppreciating the importance of literature to the soldier on duty, the\r\npublisher will send the CONTINENTAL, _gratis_, to any regiment in active\r\nservice, on application being made by its Colonel or Chaplain; he will\r\nalso receive subscriptions from those desiring to furnish it to soldiers\r\nin the ranks at half the regular price; but in such cases it must be\r\nmailed from the office of publication.\r\n\r\nJ.R. GILMORE, 110 Tremont Street, Boston.\r\n\r\nCHARLES T. EVANS, at G.P. PUTNAM'S, 532 Broadway, New York, is\r\nauthorized to receive Subscriptions in that City.\r\n\r\nN.B.--Newspapers publishing this Prospectus, and giving the CONTINENTAL\r\nmonthly notices, will be entitled to an exchange.",
