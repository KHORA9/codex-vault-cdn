Slush Funds\r\n\r\nAccording to David McClintick (\"Swordfish: A True\r\nStory of Ambition, Savagery, and Betrayal\"), in the late\r\n1980's, the FBI and DEA set up dummy corporations to\r\ndeal in drugs. They funneled into these corporate fronts\r\nmoney from drug-related asset seizures.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to infiltrate global crime networks but a lot\r\nof the money in \"Operation Swordfish\" may have ended\r\nup in the wrong pockets. Government agents and sheriffs\r\ngot mysteriously and filthily rich and the whole sorry\r\naffair was wound down. The GAO reported more than\r\n$3.6 billion missing. This bit of history gave rise to at\r\nleast one blockbuster with Oscar-winner Halle Berry.\r\n\r\nAlas, slush funds are much less glamorous in reality. They\r\nusually involve grubby politicians, pawky bankers, and\r\nphilistine businessmen - rather than glamorous hackers\r\nand James Bondean secret agents.\r\n\r\nThe Kazakh prime minister, Imanghaliy\r\nTasmaghambetov, freely admitted on April 4, 2002 to his\r\ncountry's rubber-stamp parliament the existence of a $1\r\nbillion slush fund. The money was apparently skimmed\r\noff the proceeds of the opaque sale of the Tengiz oilfield.\r\n\r\nRemitting it to Kazakhstan - he expostulated with a poker\r\nface - would have fostered inflation. So, the country's\r\npresident, Nazarbaev, kept the funds abroad \"for use in\r\nthe event of either an economic crisis or a threat to\r\nKazakhstan's security\".\r\n\r\nThe money was used to pay off pension arrears in 1997\r\nand to offset the pernicious effects of the 1998\r\ndevaluation of the Russian ruble. What was left was duly\r\ntransferred to the $1.5 billion National Fund, the PM\r\ninsisted. Alas, the original money in the Fund came\r\nentirely from another sale of oil assets to Chevron, thus\r\ncasting in doubt the official version.\r\n\r\nThe National Fund was, indeed, augmented by a transfer\r\nor two from the slush fund - but at least one of these\r\ntransfers occurred only 11 days after the damning\r\nrevelations. Moreover, despite incontrovertible evidence\r\nto the contrary, the unfazed premier denied that his\r\npresident possesses multi-million dollar bank accounts\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nHe later rescinded this last bit of disinformation. The\r\npresident, he said, has no bank accounts abroad but will\r\npromptly return all the money in these non-existent\r\naccounts to Kazakhstan. These vehemently denied\r\naccounts, he speculated, were set up by the president's\r\nadversaries \"for the purpose of compromising his name\".\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 2002 even the docile opposition had enough\r\nof this fuzzy logic. They established a People Oil's Fund\r\nto monitor, henceforth, the regime's financial shenanigans.\r\n\r\nBy their calculations less than 7 percent of the income\r\nfrom the sale of hydrocarbon fuels (c. $4-5 billion\r\nannually) make it to the national budget.\r\n\r\nSlush funds infect every corner of the globe, not only the\r\nmore obscure and venal ones. Every secret service - from\r\nthe Mossad to the CIA - operates outside the stated state\r\nbudget. Slush funds are used to launder money, shower\r\ncronies with patronage, and bribe decision makers. In\r\nsome countries, setting them up is a criminal offense, as\r\nper the 1990 Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure,\r\nand Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime. Other\r\njurisdictions are more forgiving.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Bishops Conference of Papua New Guinea\r\nand the Solomon Islands issued a press release November\r\n2001 in which it welcomed the government's plans to\r\nabolish slush funds. They described the poisonous effect\r\nof this practice:\r\n\"With a few notable exceptions, the practice of directing\r\nfunds through politicians to district projects has been\r\ndisastrous. It has created an atmosphere in which\r\ncorruption is thought to have flourished. It has reduced\r\nthe responsibility of public servants, without reducing\r\ntheir numbers or costs. It has been used to confuse\r\npeople into believing public funds are the 'property' of\r\nindividual members rather than the property of the\r\npeople, honestly and fairly administered by the servants\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThe concept of 'slush-funds' has resulted in well-\r\ndocumented inefficiencies and failures. There were even\r\naccusations made that funds were withheld from certain\r\nmembers as a way of forcing them into submission. It\r\nseems that the era of the 'slush funds' has been a\r\nshameful period.\"\r\n\r\nBut even is the most orderly and lawful administration,\r\nfunds are liable to be mislaid. \"The Economist\" reported\r\nrecently about a $10 billion class-action suit filed by\r\nnative-Americans against the US government. The funds,\r\nsupposed to be managed in trust since 1880 on behalf of\r\nhalf a million beneficiaries, were \"either lost or stolen\"\r\naccording to officials.\r\n\r\nRob Gordon, the Director of the National Wilderness\r\nInstitute accused \"The US Interior Department (of)\r\nlooting the special funds that were established to pay for\r\nwildlife conservation and squandering the money instead\r\non questionable administrative expenses, slush funds and\r\nemployee moving expenses\".\r\n\r\nCharles Griffin, the Deputy Director of the Heritage\r\nFoundation's Government Integrity Project, charges:\r\n\"The federal budget provides numerous slush funds that\r\ncan be used to subsidize the lobbying and political\r\nactivities of special-interest groups\".\r\n\r\nOn his list of \"Top Ten Federal Programs That Actively\r\nSubsidize Politics and Lobbying\" are: AmeriCorps, Senior\r\nCommunity Service Employment Program, Legal\r\nServices Corporation, Title X Family Planning, National\r\nEndowment for the Humanities, Market Promotion\r\nProgram, Senior Environmental Employment Program,\r\nSuperfund Worker Training, HHS Discretionary Aging\r\nProjects, Telecomm. & Info. Infrastructure Assistance.\r\n\r\nThese federal funds alone total $1.8 billion.\r\n\"Next\" and \"China Times\" - later joined by \"The\r\nWashington Post\" - accused the former Taiwanese\r\npresident, Lee Teng-hui, of forming a $100 million\r\noverseas slush fund intended to finance the gathering of\r\ninformation, influence-peddling, and propaganda\r\noperations. Taiwan footed the bills trips by Congressional\r\naides and funded academic research and think tank\r\nconferences.\r\n\r\nHigh ranking Japanese officials, among others, may have\r\nreceived payments through this stealthy venue. Lee is\r\nalleged to have drawn $100,000 from the secret account in\r\nFebruary 1999. The money was used to pay for the studies\r\nof a former Japanese Vice-Defense Minister Masahiro\r\nAkiyama's at Harvard.\r\n\r\nRyutaro Hashimoto, the former Japanese prime minister,\r\nwas implicated as a beneficiary of the fund. So were the\r\nprestigious lobbying firm, Cassidy and Associates and\r\nassorted assistant secretaries in the Bush administration.\r\n\r\nCarl Ford, Jr., currently assistant secretary of state for\r\nintelligence and research, worked for Cassidy during the\r\nrelevant period and often visited Taiwan. James Kelly,\r\nassistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific\r\nAffairs enjoyed the Taiwanese largesse as well. Both are\r\nin charge of crafting America's policy on Taiwan.\r\n\r\nJohn Bolton, erstwhile undersecretary of state for arms\r\ncontrol and international security, admitted, during his\r\nconfirmation hearings, to having received $30,000 to\r\ncover the costs of writing 3 research papers.\r\n\r\nThe Taiwanese government has yet to deny the news\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nA Japanese foreign ministry official used slush fund\r\nmoney to finance the extra-marital activities of himself\r\nand many of his colleagues - often in posh hotel suites.\r\n\r\nBut this was no exception. According to Asahi Shimbun,\r\nmore than half of the 60 divisions of the ministry\r\nmaintained similar funds. The police and the ministry are\r\ninvestigating. One arrest has been made. The ministry's\r\naccounting division has discovered these corrupt practices\r\ntwenty years before but kept mum.\r\n\r\nEven low-level prefectural bureaucrats and teachers in\r\nJapan build up slush funds by faking business trips or\r\npadding invoices and receipts. Japanese citizens' groups\r\nconservatively estimated that $20 million in travel and\r\nentertainment expenses in the prefectures in 1994 were\r\nfaked, a practice known as \"kara shutcho\" (i.e., empty\r\nbusiness trip).\r\n\r\nOfficials of the Hokkaido Board of Education admitted to\r\nthe existence of a 100 million yen secret fund. In a\r\nresulting probe, 200 out of 286 schools were found to\r\nmaintain their own slush funds. Some of the money was\r\nused to support friendly politicians.\r\n\r\nBut slush funds are not a sovereign prerogative.\r\n\r\nMultinationals, banks, corporation, religious\r\norganizations, political parties, and even NGO's salt away\r\nsome of their revenues and profits in undisclosed\r\naccounts, usually in off-shore havens.\r\n\r\nSecret election campaign slush funds are a fixture in\r\nAmerican politics. A 5-year old bill requires disclosure of\r\ndonors to such funds but the House is busy loosening its\r\nprovisions. \"The Economist\" listed in 2002 the tsunami of\r\nscandals that engulfs Germany, both its major political\r\nparties, many of the Lander and numerous highly placed\r\nand mid-level bureaucrats. Secret, mainly party, funds\r\nseem to be involved in the majority of these lurid affairs.\r\n\r\nItalian firms made donations to political parties through\r\nslush funds, though corporate donations - providing they\r\nare transparent - are perfectly legal in Italy. Both the right\r\nand, to a lesser extent, the left in France are said to have\r\nmanaged enormous political slush funds.\r\n\r\nPresident Chirac is accused of having abused for his\r\npersonal pleasure, one such municipal fund in Paris, when\r\nhe was its mayor. But the funds were mostly used to\r\nprovide party activists with mock jobs. Corporations paid\r\nkickbacks to obtain public works or local building\r\npermits. Ostensibly, they were paying for sham\r\n\"consultancy services\".\r\n\r\nThe epidemic hasn't skipped even staid Ottawa. Its Chief\r\nElectoral Officer told Sun Media in September 2001 that\r\nhe is \"concerned\" about millions stashed away by Liberal\r\ncandidates. Sundry ministers who coveted the prime\r\nminister's job, have raised funds covertly and probably\r\nillegally.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, 2002 UPI reported that Spain's second-\r\nlargest bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA),\r\nheld nearly $200 million hidden in secret offshore\r\naccounts, \"which were allegedly used to manipulate\r\npoliticians, pay off the 'revolutionary tax' to ETA - the\r\nBasque terrorist organization - and open the door for\r\nbusiness deals, according to news reports\".\r\n\r\nThe money may have gone to luminaries such as\r\nVenezuela's Hugo Chavez, Peru's Alberto Fujomori and\r\nVladimiro Montesinos. The bank's board members\r\nreceived fat, tax-free, \"pensions\" from the illegal accounts\r\nopened in 1987 - a total of more than $20 million.\r\n\r\nLatin American drug money launderers - from Puerto\r\nRico to Colombia - may have worked through these funds\r\nand the bank's clandestine entities in the Cayman Islands\r\nand Jersey. The current Spanish Secretary of State for the\r\nTreasury has been the bank's tax advisor between 1992-7.\r\n\r\nThe \"Financial Times\" reported in June 2000 that, in\r\nanticipation of new international measures to curb\r\ncorruption, \"leading European arms manufacturers\"\r\nresorted to the creation of off-shore slush funds. The\r\nmoney is intended to bribe foreign officials to win tenders\r\nand contracts.\r\n\r\nKim Woo-chung, Daewoo's former chairman, is at the\r\ncenter of a massive scandal involving dozens of his\r\ncompany's executive, some of whom ended up in prison.\r\n\r\nHe stands accused of diverting a whopping $20 billion to\r\nan overseas slush fund.\r\n\r\nA mind boggling $10 billion were alleged to have been\r\nused to bribe Korean government officials and politicians.\r\n\r\nBut his conduct and even the scale of the fraud he\r\nperpetrated may have been typical to Korea's post-war\r\nincestuous relationship between politics and business.\r\n\r\nIn his paper \"The Role of Slush Funds in the Preparation\r\nof Corruption Mechanisms\", reprinted by Transparency\r\nInternational, Gherardo Colombo defines corporate slush\r\nfunds thus:\r\n\"Slush funds are obtained from a joint stock company's\r\nfinances, carefully managed so that the amounts\r\ninvolved do not appear on the balance sheet. They do not\r\nnecessarily have to consist of money, but can also take\r\nthe form of stocks and shares or other economically\r\nvaluable goods (works of art, jewels, yachts, etc.) It is\r\nenough that they can be used without any particular\r\ndifficulty or that they can be transferred to a third party.\r\n\r\nIf a fund is in the form of money, it is not even necessary\r\nto refer to it outside the company accounts, since it can\r\nappear in them in disguised form (the 'accruals and\r\ndeferrals' heads are often resorted to for the purpose of\r\nhiding slush money). In light of this, it is not always\r\ncorrect to regard it as a reserve fund that is not\r\naccounted for in the books. Deception, trickery or\r\nforgery of various kinds are often resorted to for the\r\npurpose of setting up a slush fund\".\r\n\r\nHe mentions padded invoices, sham contracts, fictitious\r\nloans, interest accruing on holding accounts, back to back\r\ntransactions with related entities (Enron) - all used to\r\nfunnel money to the slush funds. Such funds are often set\r\nup to cover for illicit and illegal self-enrichment,\r\nembezzlement, or tax evasion.\r\n\r\nLess known is the role of these furtive vehicles in\r\nfinancing unfair competitive practices, such as dumping.\r\n\r\nClients, suppliers, and partners receive hidden rebates and\r\nsubsidies that much increase the - unreported - real cost of\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nBBVA's payments to ETA may have been a typical\r\npayment of protection fees. Both terrorists and organized\r\ncrime put slush funds to bad use. They get paid from such\r\nfunds - and maintain their own. Ransom payments to\r\nkidnappers often flow through these channels.\r\n\r\nBut slush funds are overwhelmingly used to bribe corrupt\r\npoliticians. The fight against corruption has been titled\r\nagainst the recipients of illicit corporate largesse. But to\r\nsucceed, well-meaning international bodies, such as the\r\nOECD's FATF, must attack with equal zeal those who\r\nbribe. Every corrupt transaction is between a venal\r\npolitician and an avaricious businessman. Pursuing the\r\none while ignoring the other is self-defeating.\r\n\r\nNote - The Psychology of Corruption\r\nMost politicians bend the laws of the land and steal\r\nmoney or solicit bribes because they need the funds to\r\nsupport networks of patronage. Others do it in order to\r\nreward their nearest and dearest or to maintain a lavish\r\nlifestyle when their political lives are over.\r\n\r\nBut these mundane reasons fail to explain why some\r\nofficeholders go on a rampage and binge on endless\r\nquantities of lucre. All rationales crumble in the face of a\r\nMobutu Sese Seko or a Saddam Hussein or a Ferdinand\r\nMarcos who absconded with billions of US dollars from\r\nthe coffers of Zaire, Iraq, and the Philippines,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThese inconceivable dollops of hard cash and valuables\r\noften remain stashed and untouched, moldering in bank\r\naccounts and safes in Western banks. They serve no\r\npurpose, either political or economic. But they do fulfill a\r\npsychological need. These hoards are not the\r\nmegalomaniacal equivalents of savings accounts. Rather\r\nthey are of the nature of compulsive collections.\r\n\r\nErstwhile president of Sierra Leone, Momoh, amassed\r\nhundreds of video players and other consumer goods in\r\nvast rooms in his mansion. As electricity supply was\r\nintermittent at best, his was a curious choice. He used to\r\nsit among these relics of his cupidity, fondling and\r\ncounting them insatiably.\r\n\r\nWhile Momoh relished things with shiny buttons, people\r\nlike Sese Seko, Hussein, and Marcos drooled over money.\r\n\r\nThe ever-heightening mountains of greenbacks in their\r\nvaults soothed them, filled them with confidence,\r\nregulated their sense of self-worth, and served as a love\r\nsubstitute. The balances in their bulging bank accounts\r\nwere of no practical import or intent. They merely catered\r\nto their psychopathology.\r\n\r\nThese politicos were not only crooks but also\r\nkleptomaniacs. They could no more stop thieving than\r\nHitler could stop murdering. Venality was an integral part\r\nof their psychological makeup.\r\n\r\nKleptomania is about acting out. It is a compensatory act.\r\n\r\nPolitics is a drab, uninspiring, unintelligent, and, often\r\nhumiliating business. It is also risky and rather arbitrary. It\r\ninvolves enormous stress and unceasing conflict.\r\n\r\nPoliticians with mental health disorders (for instance,\r\nnarcissists or psychopaths) react by decompensation. They\r\nrob the state and coerce businessmen to grease their palms\r\nbecause it makes them feel better, it helps them to repress\r\ntheir mounting fears and frustrations, and to restore their\r\npsychodynamic equilibrium. These politicians and\r\nbureaucrats \"let off steam\" by looting.\r\n\r\nKleptomaniacs fail to resist or control the impulse to steal,\r\neven if they have no use for the booty. According to the\r\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual IV-TR (2000), the bible\r\nof psychiatry, kleptomaniacs feel \"pleasure, gratification,\r\nor relief when committing the theft.\" The good book\r\nproceeds to say that \" ... (T)he individual may hoard the\r\nstolen objects ...\".\r\n\r\nAs most kleptomaniac politicians are also psychopaths,\r\nthey rarely feel remorse or fear the consequences of their\r\nmisdeeds. But this only makes them more culpable and\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Corruption and Transparency\r\n\r\nI. The Facts\r\nJust days before a much-awaited donor conference, the\r\ninfluential International Crisis Group (ICG) recommended\r\nto place all funds pledged to Macedonia under the\r\noversight of a \"corruption advisor\" appointed by the\r\nEuropean Commission. The donors ignored this and other\r\nrecommendations. To appease the critics, the affable\r\nAttorney General of Macedonia charged a former Minister\r\nof Defense with abuse of duty for allegedly having\r\nchanneled millions of DM to his relatives during the\r\nrecent civil war. Macedonia has belatedly passed an anti-\r\nmoney laundering law recently - but failed, yet again, to\r\nadopt strict anti-corruption legislation.\r\n\r\nIn Albania, the Chairman of the Albanian Socialist Party,\r\nFatos Nano, was accused by Albanian media of\r\nlaundering $1 billion through the Albanian government.\r\n\r\nPavel Borodin, the former chief of Kremlin Property,\r\ndecided not appeal his money laundering conviction in a\r\nSwiss court. The Slovak daily \"Sme\" described in\r\nscathing detail the newly acquired wealth and lavish\r\nlifestyles of formerly impoverished HZDS politicians.\r\n\r\nSome of them now reside in refurbished castles. Others\r\nhave swimming pools replete with wine bars.\r\n\r\nPavlo Lazarenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister, is\r\ndetained in San Francisco on money laundering charges.\r\n\r\nHis defense team accuses the US authorities of \"selective\r\nprosecution\".\r\n\r\nThey are quoted by Radio Free Europe as saying:\r\n\"The impetus for this prosecution comes from allegations\r\nmade by the Kuchma regime, which itself is corrupt and\r\ndedicated to using undemocratic and repressive methods\r\nto stifle political opposition ... (other Ukrainian officials)\r\nincluding Kuchma himself and his closest associates, have\r\ncommitted conduct similar to that with which Lazarenko\r\nis charged but have not been prosecuted by the U.S.\r\ngovernment\".\r\n\r\nThe UNDP estimated, in 1997, that, even in rich,\r\nindustrialized, countries, 15% of all firms had to pay\r\nbribes. The figure rises to 40% in Asia and 60% in Russia.\r\n\r\nCorruption is rife and all pervasive, though many\r\nallegations are nothing but political mud-slinging.\r\n\r\nLuckily, in countries like Macedonia, it is confined to its\r\nrapacious elites: its politicians, managers, university\r\nprofessors, medical doctors, judges, journalists, and top\r\nbureaucrats. The police and customs are hopelessly\r\ncompromised. Yet, one rarely comes across graft and\r\nvenality in daily life. There are no false detentions (as in\r\nRussia), spurious traffic tickets (as in Latin America), or\r\nwidespread stealthy payments for public goods and\r\nservices (as in Africa).\r\n\r\nIt is widely accepted that corruption retards growth by\r\ndeterring foreign investment and encouraging brain drain.\r\n\r\nIt leads to the misallocation of economic resources and\r\ndistorts competition. It depletes the affected country's\r\nendowments - both natural and acquired. It demolishes the\r\ntenuous trust between citizen and state. It casts civil and\r\ngovernment institutions in doubt, tarnishes the entire\r\npolitical class, and, thus, endangers the democratic system\r\nand the rule of law, property rights included.\r\n\r\nThis is why both governments and business show a\r\ngrowing commitment to tackling it. According to\r\nTransparency International's \"Global Corruption Report\r\n2001\", corruption has been successfully contained in\r\nprivate banking and the diamond trade, for instance.\r\n\r\nHence also the involvement of the World Bank and the\r\nIMF in fighting corruption. Both institutions are\r\nincreasingly concerned with poverty reduction through\r\neconomic growth and development. The World Bank\r\nestimates that corruption reduces the growth rate of an\r\naffected country by 0.5 to 1 percent annually. Graft\r\namounts to an increase in the marginal tax rate and has\r\npernicious effects on inward investment as well.\r\n\r\nThe World Bank has appointed last year a Director of\r\nInstitutional Integrity - a new department that combines\r\nthe Anti-Corruption and Fraud Investigations Unit and the\r\nOffice of Business Ethics and Integrity. The Bank helps\r\ncountries to fight corruption by providing them with\r\ntechnical assistance, educational programs, and lending.\r\n\r\nAnti-corruption projects are an integral part of every\r\nCountry Assistance Strategy (CAS). The Bank also\r\nsupports international efforts to reduce corruption by\r\nsponsoring conferences and the exchange of information.\r\n\r\nIt collaborates closely with Transparency International,\r\nfor instance.\r\n\r\nAt the request of member-governments (such as Bosnia-\r\nHerzegovina and Romania) it has prepared detailed\r\ncountry corruption surveys covering both the public and\r\nthe private sectors. Together with the EBRD, it publishes\r\na corruption survey of 3000 firms in 22 transition\r\ncountries (BEEPS - Business Environment and Enterprise\r\nPerformance Survey). It has even set up a multilingual\r\nhotline for whistleblowers.\r\n\r\nThe IMF made corruption an integral part of its country\r\nevaluation process. It suspended arrangements with\r\nendemically corrupt recipients of IMF financing. Since\r\n1997, it has introduced policies regarding misreporting,\r\nabuse of IMF funds, monitoring the use of debt relief for\r\npoverty reduction, data dissemination, legal and judicial\r\nreform, fiscal and monetary transparency, and even\r\ninternal governance (e.g., financial disclosure by staff\r\nmembers).\r\n\r\nYet, no one seems to agree on a universal definition of\r\ncorruption. What amounts to venality in one culture\r\n(Sweden) is considered no more than hospitality, or an\r\nexpression of gratitude, in another (France, or Italy).\r\n\r\nCorruption is discussed freely and forgivingly in one\r\nplace - but concealed shamefully in another. Corruption,\r\nlike other crimes, is probably seriously under-reported and\r\nunder-penalized.\r\n\r\nMoreover, bribing officials is often the unstated policy of\r\nmultinationals, foreign investors, and expatriates. Many of\r\nthem believe that it is inevitable if one is to expedite\r\nmatters or secure a beneficial outcome. Rich world\r\ngovernments turn a blind eye, even where laws against\r\nsuch practices are extant and strict.\r\n\r\nIn his address to the Inter-American Development Bank\r\non March 14, President Bush promised to \"reward nations\r\nthat root out corruption\" within the framework of the\r\nMillennium Challenge Account initiative. The USA has\r\npioneered global anti-corruption campaigns and is a\r\nsignatory to the 1996 IAS Inter-American Convention\r\nagainst Corruption, the Council of Europe's Criminal Law\r\nConvention on Corruption, and the OECD's 1997 anti-\r\nbribery convention. The USA has had a comprehensive\r\n\"Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\" since 1977.\r\n\r\nThe Act applies to all American firms, to all firms -\r\nincluding foreign ones - traded in an American stock\r\nexchange, and to bribery on American territory by foreign\r\nand American firms alike. It outlaws the payment of\r\nbribes to foreign officials, political parties, party officials,\r\nand political candidates in foreign countries. A similar law\r\nhas now been adopted by Britain.\r\n\r\nYet, \"The Economist\" reports that the American SEC has\r\nbrought only three cases against listed companies until\r\n1997. The US Department of Justice brought another 30\r\ncases. Britain has persecuted successfully only one of its\r\nofficials for overseas bribery since 1889. In the\r\nNetherlands bribery is tax deductible. Transparency\r\nInternational now publishes a name and shame Bribery\r\nPayers Index to complement its 91-country strong\r\nCorruption Perceptions Index.\r\n\r\nMany rich world corporations and wealthy individuals\r\nmake use of off-shore havens or \"special purpose entities\"\r\nto launder money, make illicit payments, avoid or evade\r\ntaxes, and conceal assets or liabilities. According to Swiss\r\nauthorities, more than $40 billion are held by Russians in\r\nits banking system alone. The figure may be 5 to 10 times\r\nhigher in the tax havens of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn a survey it conducted last month of 82 companies in\r\nwhich it invests, \"Friends, Ivory, and Sime\" found that\r\nonly a quarter had clear anti-corruption management and\r\naccountability systems in place.\r\n\r\nTellingly only 35 countries signed the 1997 OECD\r\n\"Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public\r\nOfficials in International Business Transactions\" -\r\nincluding four non-OECD members: Chile, Argentina,\r\nBulgaria, and Brazil. The convention has been in force\r\nsince February 1999 and is only one of many OECD anti-\r\ncorruption drives, among which are SIGMA (Support for\r\nImprovement in Governance and Management in Central\r\nand Eastern European countries), ACN (Anti-Corruption\r\nNetwork for Transition Economies in Europe), and FATF\r\n(the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering).\r\n\r\nMoreover, The moral authority of those who preach\r\nagainst corruption in poor countries - the officials of the\r\nIMF, the World Bank, the EU, the OECD - is strained by\r\ntheir ostentatious lifestyle, conspicuous consumption, and\r\n\"pragmatic\" morality.\r\n\r\nII. What to Do? What is Being Done?\r\nTwo years ago, I proposed a taxonomy of corruption,\r\nvenality, and graft. I suggested this cumulative definition:\r\na. The withholding of a service, information, or\r\ngoods that, by law, and by right, should have been\r\nprovided or divulged.\r\nb. The provision of a service, information, or goods\r\nthat, by law, and by right, should not have been\r\nprovided or divulged.\r\nc. That the withholding or the provision of said\r\nservice, information, or goods are in the power of\r\nthe withholder or the provider to withhold or to\r\nprovide AND That the withholding or the\r\nprovision of said service, information, or goods\r\nconstitute an integral and substantial part of the\r\nauthority or the function of the withholder or the\r\nprovider.\r\nd. That the service, information, or goods that are\r\nprovided or divulged are provided or divulged\r\nagainst a benefit or the promise of a benefit from\r\nthe recipient and as a result of the receipt of this\r\nspecific benefit or the promise to receive such\r\nbenefit.\r\ne. That the service, information, or goods that are\r\nwithheld are withheld because no benefit was\r\nprovided or promised by the recipient.\r\n\r\nThere is also what the World Bank calls \"State Capture\"\r\ndefined thus:\r\n\"The actions of individuals, groups, or firms, both in the\r\npublic and private sectors, to influence the formation of\r\nlaws, regulations, decrees, and other government policies\r\nto their own advantage as a result of the illicit and non-\r\ntransparent provision of private benefits to public\r\nofficials\".\r\n\r\nWe can classify corrupt and venal behaviors according to\r\ntheir outcomes:\r\na. Income Supplement - Corrupt actions whose sole\r\noutcome is the supplementing of the income of the\r\nprovider without affecting the \"real world\" in any\r\nmanner.\r\nb. Acceleration or Facilitation Fees - Corrupt\r\npractices whose sole outcome is to accelerate or\r\nfacilitate decision making, the provision of goods\r\nand services or the divulging of information.\r\nc. Decision Altering (State Capture) Fees - Bribes\r\nand promises of bribes which alter decisions or\r\naffect them, or which affect the formation of\r\npolicies, laws, regulations, or decrees beneficial to\r\nthe bribing entity or person.\r\nd. Information Altering Fees - Backhanders and\r\nbribes that subvert the flow of true and complete\r\ninformation within a society or an economic unit\r\n(for instance, by selling professional diplomas,\r\ncertificates, or permits).\r\ne. Reallocation Fees - Benefits paid (mainly to\r\npoliticians and political decision makers) in order\r\nto affect the allocation of economic resources and\r\nmaterial wealth or the rights thereto. Concessions,\r\nlicenses, permits, assets privatized, tenders\r\nawarded are all subject to reallocation fees.\r\n\r\nTo eradicate corruption, one must tackle both giver and\r\ntaker.\r\n\r\nHistory shows that all effective programs shared these\r\ncommon elements:\r\na. The persecution of corrupt, high-profile, public\r\nfigures, multinationals, and institutions (domestic\r\nand foreign). This demonstrates that no one is\r\nabove the law and that crime does not pay.\r\nb. The conditioning of international aid, credits, and\r\ninvestments on a monitored reduction in\r\ncorruption levels. The structural roots of\r\ncorruption should be tackled rather than merely its\r\nsymptoms.\r\nc. The institution of incentives to avoid corruption,\r\nsuch as a higher pay, the fostering of civic pride,\r\n\"good behavior\" bonuses, alternative income and\r\npension plans, and so on.\r\nd. In many new countries (in Asia, Africa, and\r\nEastern Europe) the very concepts of \"private\"\r\nversus \"public\" property are fuzzy and\r\nimpermissible behaviors are not clearly\r\ndemarcated. Massive investments in education of\r\nthe public and of state officials are required.\r\ne. Liberalization and deregulation of the economy.\r\n\r\nAbolition of red tape, licensing, protectionism,\r\ncapital controls, monopolies, discretionary, non-\r\npublic, procurement. Greater access to information\r\nand a public debate intended to foster a\r\n\"stakeholder society\".\r\nf. Strengthening of institutions: the police, the\r\ncustoms, the courts, the government, its agencies,\r\nthe tax authorities - under time limited foreign\r\nmanagement and supervision.\r\n\r\nAwareness to corruption and graft is growing - though it\r\nmostly results in lip service. The Global Coalition for\r\nAfrica adopted anti-corruption guidelines in 1999. The\r\notherwise opaque Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation\r\n(APEC) forum is now championing transparency and\r\ngood governance. The UN is promoting its pet convention\r\nagainst corruption.\r\n\r\nThe G-8 asked its Lyon Group of senior experts on\r\ntransnational crime to recommend ways to fight\r\ncorruption related to large money flows and money\r\nlaundering. The USA and the Netherlands hosted global\r\nforums on corruption - as will South Korea next year. The\r\nOSCE is rumored to respond with its own initiative, in\r\ncollaboration with the US Congressional Helsinki\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nThe south-eastern Europe Stability Pact sports its own\r\nStability Pact Anti-corruption Initiative (SPAI). It held its\r\nfirst conference in September 2001 in Croatia. More than\r\n1200 delegates participated in the 10th International Anti-\r\nCorruption Conference in Prague last year. The\r\nconference was attended by the Czech prime minister, the\r\nMexican president, and the head of the Interpol.\r\n\r\nThe most potent remedy against corruption is sunshine -\r\nfree, accessible, and available information disseminated\r\nand probed by an active opposition, uncompromised\r\npress, and assertive civic organizations and NGO's. In the\r\nabsence of these, the fight against official avarice and\r\ncriminality is doomed to failure. With them, it stands a\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nCorruption can never be entirely eliminated - but it can be\r\nrestrained and its effects confined. The cooperation of\r\ngood people with trustworthy institutions is indispensable.\r\n\r\nCorruption can be defeated only from the inside, though\r\nwith plenty of outside help. It is a process of self-\r\nredemption and self-transformation. It is the real\r\ntransition.\r\n\r\nIII. Asset Confiscation and Asset Forfeiture\r\nThe abuse of asset confiscation and forfeiture statutes by\r\ngovernments, law enforcement agencies, and political\r\nappointees and cronies throughout the world is well-\r\ndocumented. In many developing countries and countries\r\nin transition, assets confiscated from real and alleged\r\ncriminals and tax evaders are sold in fake auctions to\r\nparty hacks, cronies, police officers, tax inspectors, and\r\nrelatives of prominent politicians at bargain basement\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nThat the assets of suspects in grave crimes and corruption\r\nshould be frozen or \"disrupted\" until they are convicted or\r\nexonerated by the courts - having exhausted their appeals\r\n- is understandable and in accordance with the Vienna\r\nConvention. But there is no justification for the seizure\r\nand sale of property otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland, financial institutions are obliged to\r\nautomatically freeze suspect transactions for a period of\r\nfive days, subject to the review of an investigative judge.\r\n\r\nIn France, the Financial Intelligence Unit can freeze funds\r\ninvolved in a reported suspicious transaction by\r\nadministrative fiat. In both jurisdictions, the fast track\r\nfreezing of assets has proven to be a more than adequate\r\nmeasure to cope with organized crime and venality.\r\n\r\nThe presumption of innocence must fully apply and due\r\nprocess upheld to prevent self-enrichment and corrupt\r\ndealings with confiscated property, including the unethical\r\nand unseemly use of the proceeds from the sale of\r\nforfeited assets to close gaping holes in strained state and\r\nmunicipal budgets.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, according to The Civil Asset\r\nForfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (HR 1658), the assets of\r\nsuspects under investigation and of criminals convicted of\r\na variety of more than 400 minor and major offenses\r\n(from soliciting a prostitute to gambling and from\r\nnarcotics charges to corruption and tax evasion) are often\r\nconfiscated and forfeited (\"in personam, or value-based\r\nconfiscation\").\r\n\r\nTechnically and theoretically, assets can be impounded or\r\nforfeited and disposed of even in hitherto minor Federal\r\ncivil offenses (mistakes in fulfilling Medicare or tax\r\nreturn forms)\r\nThe UK's Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) that is in\r\ncharge of enforcing the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, had\r\nthis chilling statement to make on May 24, 2007:\r\n\"We are pursuing the assets of those involved in a wide\r\nrange of crime including drug dealing, people\r\ntrafficking, fraud, extortion, smuggling, control of\r\nprostitution, counterfeiting, benefit fraud, tax evasion\r\nand environmental crimes such as illegal dumping of\r\nwaste and illegal fishing.\" (!)\r\nDrug dealing and illegal fishing in the same sentence.\r\n\r\nThe British firm Bentley-Jennison, who provide Forensic\r\nAccounting Services, add:\r\n\"In some cases the defendants will even have their assets\r\nseized at the start of an investigation, before any charges\r\nhave been considered. In many cases the authorities will\r\nassume that all of the assets held by the defendant are\r\nillegally obtained as he has a \"criminal lifestyle\". It is\r\nthen down to the defendant to prove otherwise. If the\r\ndefendant is judged to have a criminal lifestyle then it\r\nwill be assumed that physical assets, such as properties\r\nand motor vehicles, have been acquired through the use\r\nof criminal funds and it will be necessary to present\r\nevidence to contradict this.\r\n\r\nThe defendant's bank accounts will also be scanned for\r\nevidence of spending and any expenditure on\r\nunidentified assets (and in some cases identified assets)\r\nis also likely to be included as alleged criminal benefit.\r\n\r\nThis often leads to the inclusion of sums from legitimate\r\nsources and double counting both of which need to be\r\neliminated\".\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the post-September 11 United\r\nStates and the FATF (Financial Action Task Force on\r\nMoney Laundering), Canada, Australia, the United\r\nKingdom, Greece, South Korea, and Russia have similar\r\nasset recovery and money laundering laws in place.\r\n\r\nInternational treaties (for instance, the 1959 European\r\nConvention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal\r\nMatters, the 1990 Convention of the Council of Europe on\r\nLaundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the\r\nProceeds from Crime (ETS 141), and The U.N.\r\n\r\nConvention against Corruption 2003- UNCAC) and\r\nEuropean Union Directives (e.g., 2001/97/EC) allow the\r\nseizure and confiscation of the assets and \"unexplained\r\nwealth\" of criminals and suspects globally, even if their\r\nalleged or proven crime does not constitute an offense\r\nwhere they own property or have bank accounts.\r\n\r\nThis abrogation of the principle of dual criminality\r\nsometimes leads to serious violations of human and civil\r\nrights. Hitler could have used it to ask the United\r\nKingdom's Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) to confiscate\r\nthe property of refugee Jews who committed \"crimes\" by\r\ninfringing on the infamous Nuremberg race laws.\r\n\r\nOnly offshore tax havens, such as Andorra, Antigua,\r\nAruba, the British Virgin Islands, Guernsey, Monaco, the\r\nNetherlands Antilles, Samoa, St. Vincent, the US Virgin\r\nIslands, and Vanuatu still resist the pressure to join in the\r\nefforts to trace and seize suspects' assets and bank\r\naccounts in the absence of a conviction or even charges.\r\n\r\nEven worse, unlike in other criminal proceedings, the\r\nburden of proof is on the defendant who has to\r\ndemonstrate that the source of the funds used to purchase\r\nthe confiscated or forfeited assets is legal. When the\r\ndefendant fails to furnish such evidence conclusively and\r\nconvincingly, or if he has left the United States or had\r\ndied, the assets are sold at an auction and the proceeds\r\nusually revert to various law enforcement agencies, to the\r\ngovernment's budget, or to good social causes and\r\nprograms. This is the case in many countries, including\r\nUnited Kingdom, United States, Germany, France, Hong\r\nKong, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Austria, Greece, Ireland,\r\nNew Zealand, Singapore and Switzerland.\r\n\r\nAccording to a brief written by Jack Smith, Mark Pieth,\r\nand Guillermo Jorge at the Basel Institute on Governance,\r\nInternational Centre for Asset Recovery:\r\n\"Article 54(1)(c) of the UNCAC recommends that states\r\nparties establish non-criminal systems of confiscation,\r\nwhich have several advantages for recovery actions: the\r\nstandard of evidence is lower (\"preponderance of the\r\nevidence\" rather than \"beyond a reasonable doubt\");\r\nthey are not subject to some of the more restrictive\r\ntraditional safeguards of international cooperation such\r\nas the offense for which the defendant is accused has to\r\nbe a crime in the receiving state (dual criminality); and\r\nit opens more formal avenues for negotiation and\r\nsettlements. This is already the practice in some\r\njurisdictions such as the US, Ireland, the UK, Italy,\r\nColombia, Slovenia, and South Africa, as well as some\r\nAustralian and Canadian States\".\r\n\r\nIn most countries, including the United Kingdom, the\r\nUnited States, Austria, Germany, Indonesia, Macedonia,\r\nand Ireland, assets can be impounded, confiscated, frozen,\r\nforfeited, and even sold prior to and without any criminal\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, Austria, Ireland, Hong-Kong, New Zealand,\r\nSingapore, United Kingdom, South Africa, United States\r\nand the Netherlands alleged and suspected criminals, their\r\nfamily members, friends, employees, and partners can be\r\nstripped of their assets even for crimes they have\r\ncommitted in other countries and even if they have merely\r\nmade use of revenues obtained from illicit activities (this\r\nis called \"in rem, or property-based confiscation\"). This\r\noften gives rise to cases of double jeopardy.\r\n\r\nTypically, the defendant is notified of the impending\r\nforfeiture or confiscation of his or her assets and has\r\nrecourse to a hearing within the relevant law enforcement\r\nagency and also to the courts. If he or she can prove\r\n\"substantial harm\" to life and business, the property may\r\nbe released to be used, though ownership is rarely\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nWhen the process of asset confiscation or asset forfeiture\r\nis initiated, banking secrecy is automatically lifted and the\r\ngovernment indemnifies the banks for any damage they\r\nmay suffer for disclosing confidential information about\r\ntheir clients' accounts.\r\n\r\nIn many countries from South Korea to Greece, lawyer-\r\nclient privilege is largely waived. The same requirements\r\nof monitoring of clients' activities and reporting to the\r\nauthorities apply to credit and financial institutions,\r\nventure capital firms, tax advisers, accountants, and\r\nnotaries.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, there are some other worrying developments:\r\nIn Bulgaria, the assets of tax evaders have recently begun\r\nto be confiscated and turned over to the National Revenue\r\nAgency and the State Receivables Collection Agency.\r\n\r\nProperty is confiscated even when the tax assessment is\r\ndisputed in the courts. The Agency cannot, however,\r\nconfiscate single-dwelling houses, bank accounts up to\r\n250 leva of one member of the family, salary or pension\r\nup to 250 leva a month, social care, and alimony, support\r\nmoney or allowances.\r\n\r\nVenezuela has recently reformed its Organic Tax Code to\r\nallow for:\r\n\" (P)re-judgment enforcement measures (to) include\r\nclosure of premises for up to ten days and confiscation\r\nof merchandise. These measures will be applied in\r\naddition to the attachment or sequestration of personal\r\nproperty and the prohibition against alienation or\r\nencumbrance of realty. During closure of premises, the\r\nemployer must continue to pay workers, thereby\r\navoiding an appeal for constitutional protection\".\r\n\r\nFinally, in many states in the United States, \"community\r\nresponsibility\" statutes require of owners of legal\r\nbusinesses to \"abate crime\" by openly fighting it\r\nthemselves. If they fail to tackle the criminals in their\r\nneighborhood, the police can seize and sell their property,\r\nincluding their apartments and cars. The proceeds from\r\nsuch sales accrue to the local municipality.\r\n\r\nIn New-York City, the police confiscated a restaurant\r\nbecause one of its regular patrons was an alleged drug\r\ndealer. In Alabama, police seized the home of a senior\r\ncitizen because her yard was used, without her consent,\r\nfor drug dealing. In Maryland, the police confiscated a\r\nfamily's home and converted it into a retreat for its\r\nofficers, having mailed one of the occupants a package of\r\nmarijuana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.Money Laundering in A Changed World\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you shop with a major bank, chances are that all the\r\ntransactions in your account are scrutinized by AML (Anti\r\nMoney Laundering) software. Billions of dollars are being\r\ninvested in these applications. They are supposed to track\r\nsuspicious transfers, deposits, and withdrawals based on\r\noverall  statistical patterns. Bank directors, exposed, under\r\nthe Patriot Act, to personal liability for money laundering\r\nin their establishments, swear by it as a legal shield and\r\nthe holy grail of the on-going war against financial crime\r\nand the finances of terrorism.\r\n\r\nQuoted in Wired.com, Neil Katkov of Celent\r\nCommunications, pegs future investments in compliance-\r\nrelated activities and products by American banks alone at\r\nclose to $15 billion in the next 3 years (2005-2008). The\r\nUnited State's Treasury Department's Financial Crimes\r\nEnforcement Network (finCEN) received c. 15 million\r\nreports in each of the years 2003 and 2004.\r\n\r\nBut this is a drop in the seething ocean of illicit financial\r\ntransactions, sometimes egged on and abetted even by the\r\nvery Western governments ostensibly dead set against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIsrael has always turned a blind eye to the origin of funds\r\ndeposited by Jews from South Africa to Russia. In Britain\r\nit is perfectly legal to hide the true ownership of a\r\ncompany. Underpaid Asian bank clerks on immigrant\r\nwork permits in the Gulf states rarely require identity\r\ndocuments from the mysterious and well-connected\r\nowners of multi-million dollar deposits.\r\n\r\nHawaladars continue plying their paperless and trust-\r\nbased trade - the transfer of billions of US dollars around\r\nthe world. American and Swiss banks collaborate with\r\ndubious correspondent banks in off shore centres.\r\n\r\nMultinationals shift money through tax free territories in\r\nwhat is euphemistically known as \"tax planning\". Internet\r\ngambling outfits and casinos serve as fronts for narco-\r\ndollars. British Bureaux de Change launder up to 2.6\r\nbillion British pounds annually.\r\n\r\nThe 500 Euro note makes it much easier to smuggle cash\r\nout of Europe. A French parliamentary committee accused\r\nthe City of London of being a money laundering haven in\r\na 400 page report. Intelligence services cover the tracks of\r\ncovert operations by opening accounts in obscure tax\r\nhavens, from Cyprus to Nauru. Money laundering, its\r\nvenues and techniques, are an integral part of the\r\neconomic fabric of the world. Business as usual?\r\nNot really. In retrospect, as far as money laundering goes,\r\nSeptember 11 may be perceived as a watershed as\r\nimportant as the precipitous collapse of communism in\r\n1989. Both events have forever altered the patterns of the\r\nglobal flows of illicit capital.\r\n\r\nWhat is Money Laundering?\r\nStrictly speaking, money laundering is the age-old process\r\nof disguising the illegal origin and criminal nature of\r\nfunds (obtained in sanctions-busting arms sales,\r\nsmuggling, trafficking in humans, organized crime, drug\r\ntrafficking, prostitution rings, embezzlement, insider\r\ntrading, bribery, and computer fraud) by moving them\r\nuntraceably and investing them in legitimate businesses,\r\nsecurities, or bank deposits. But this narrow definition\r\nmasks the fact that the bulk of money laundered is the\r\nresult of tax evasion, tax avoidance, and outright tax\r\nfraud, such as the \"VAT carousel scheme\" in the EU\r\n(moving goods among businesses in various jurisdictions\r\nto capitalize on differences in VAT rates). Tax-related\r\nlaundering nets between 10-20 billion US dollars annually\r\nfrom France and Russia alone. The confluence of criminal\r\nand tax averse funds in money laundering networks serves\r\nto obscure the sources of both.\r\n\r\nThe Scale of the Problem\r\nAccording to a 1996 IMF estimate, money laundered\r\nannually amounts to 2-5% of world GDP (between 800\r\nbillion and 2 trillion US dollars in today's terms). The\r\nlower figure is considerably larger than an average\r\nEuropean economy, such as Spain's.\r\n\r\nThe System\r\nIt is important to realize that money laundering takes\r\nplace within the banking system. Big amounts of cash are\r\nspread among numerous accounts (sometimes in free\r\neconomic zones, financial off shore centers, and tax\r\nhavens), converted to bearer financial instruments (money\r\norders, bonds), or placed with trusts and charities. The\r\nmoney is then transferred to other locations, sometimes as\r\nbogus payments for \"goods and services\" against fake or\r\ninflated invoices issued by holding companies owned by\r\nlawyers or accountants on behalf of unnamed\r\nbeneficiaries. The transferred funds are re-assembled in\r\ntheir destination and often \"shipped\" back to the point of\r\norigin under a new identity. The laundered funds are then\r\ninvested in the legitimate economy. It is a simple\r\nprocedure - yet an effective one. It results in either no\r\npaper trail - or too much of it. The accounts are invariably\r\nliquidated and all traces erased.\r\n\r\nWhy is It a Problem?\r\nCriminal and tax evading funds are idle and non-\r\nproductive. Their injection, however surreptitiously, into\r\nthe economy transforms them into a productive (and\r\ncheap) source of capital. Why is this negative?\r\nBecause it corrupts government officials, banks and their\r\nofficers, contaminates legal sectors of the economy,\r\ncrowds out legitimate and foreign capital, makes money\r\nsupply unpredictable and uncontrollable, and increases\r\ncross-border capital movements, thereby enhancing the\r\nvolatility of exchange rates.\r\n\r\nA multilateral, co-ordinated, effort (exchange of\r\ninformation, uniform laws, extra-territorial legal powers)\r\nis required to counter the international dimensions of\r\nmoney laundering. Many countries opt in because money\r\nlaundering has also become a domestic political and\r\neconomic concern. The United Nations, the Bank for\r\nInternational Settlements, the OECD's FATF (Financial\r\nAction Task Force), the EU, the Council of Europe, the\r\nOrganisation of American States, all published anti-\r\nmoney laundering standards. Regional groupings were\r\nformed (or are being established) in the Caribbean, Asia,\r\nEurope, southern Africa, western Africa, and Latin\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nMoney Laundering in the Wake of the September 11\r\nAttacks\r\nRegulation\r\nThe least important trend is the tightening of financial\r\nregulations and the establishment or enhancement of\r\ncompulsory (as opposed to industry or voluntary)\r\nregulatory and enforcement agencies.\r\n\r\nNew legislation in the US which amounts to extending the\r\npowers of the CIA domestically and of the DOJ extra-\r\nterritorially, was rather xenophobically described by a\r\nDOJ official, Michael Chertoff, as intended to \"make sure\r\nthe American banking system does not become a haven\r\nfor foreign corrupt leaders or other kinds of foreign\r\norganized criminals\".\r\n\r\nPrivacy and bank secrecy laws have been watered down.\r\n\r\nCollaboration with off shore \"shell\" banks has been\r\nbanned. Business with clients of correspondent banks was\r\ncurtailed. Banks were effectively transformed into law\r\nenforcement agencies, responsible to verify both the\r\nidentities of their (foreign) clients and the source and\r\norigin of their funds. Cash transactions were partly\r\ncriminalized. And the securities and currency trading\r\nindustry, insurance companies, and money transfer\r\nservices are subjected to growing scrutiny as a conduit for\r\n\"dirty cash\".\r\n\r\nStill, such legislation is highly ineffective. The American\r\nBankers' Association puts the cost of compliance with the\r\nlaxer anti-money-laundering laws in force in 1998 at 10\r\nbillion US dollars - or more than 10 million US dollars per\r\nobtained conviction. Even when the system does work,\r\ncritical alerts drown in the torrent of reports mandated by\r\nthe regulations. One bank actually reported a suspicious\r\ntransaction in the account of one of the September 11\r\nhijackers - only to be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury Department established Operation Green\r\nQuest, an investigative team charged with monitoring\r\ncharities, NGO's, credit card fraud, cash smuggling,\r\ncounterfeiting, and the Hawala networks. This is not\r\nwithout precedent. Previous teams tackled drug money,\r\nthe biggest money laundering venue ever, BCCI (Bank of\r\nCredit and Commerce International), and ... Al Capone.\r\n\r\nThe more veteran, New-York based, El-Dorado anti\r\nmoney laundering Task Force (established in 1992) will\r\nlend a hand and share information.\r\n\r\nMore than 150 countries promised to co-operate with the\r\nUS in its fight against the financing of terrorism - 81 of\r\nwhich (including the Bahamas, Argentina, Kuwait,\r\nIndonesia, Pakistan, Switzerland, and the EU) actually\r\nfroze assets of suspicious individuals, suspected charities,\r\nand dubious firms, or passed new anti money laundering\r\nlaws and stricter regulations (the Philippines, the UK,\r\nGermany).\r\n\r\nA EU directive now forces lawyers to disclose\r\nincriminating information about their clients' money\r\nlaundering activities. Pakistan initiated a \"loyalty\r\nscheme\", awarding expatriates who prefer official bank\r\nchannels to the much maligned (but cheaper and more\r\nefficient) Hawala, with extra baggage allowance and\r\nspecial treatment in airports.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of this international collaboration is\r\nunprecedented. But this burst of solidarity may yet fade.\r\n\r\nChina, for instance, refuses to chime in. As a result, the\r\nstatement issued by APEC in November 2001 on\r\nmeasures to stem the finances of terrorism was lukewarm\r\nat best. And, protestations of close collaboration to the\r\ncontrary, Saudi Arabia has done nothing to combat money\r\nlaundering \"Islamic charities\" (of which it is proud) on its\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nStill, a universal code is emerging, based on the work of\r\nthe OECD's FATF (Financial Action Task Force) since\r\n1989 (its famous \"40 recommendations\") and on the\r\nrelevant UN conventions. All countries are expected by\r\nthe West, on pain of possible sanctions, to adopt a\r\nuniform legal platform (including reporting on suspicious\r\ntransactions and freezing assets) and to apply it to all\r\ntypes of financial intermediaries, not only to banks. This\r\nis likely to result in...\r\n\r\nThe Decline of off Shore Financial Centres and Tax\r\nHavens\r\nBy far the most important outcome of this new-fangled\r\njuridical homogeneity is the acceleration of the decline of\r\noff shore financial and banking centres and tax havens.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between off-shore and on-shore will\r\nvanish. Of the FATF's \"name and shame\" blacklist of 19\r\n\"black holes\" (poorly regulated territories, including\r\nIsrael, Indonesia, and Russia) - 11 have substantially\r\nrevamped their banking laws and financial regulators.\r\n\r\nCoupled with the tightening of US, UK, and EU laws and\r\nthe wider interpretation of money laundering to include\r\npolitical corruption, bribery, and embezzlement - this\r\nwould make life a lot more difficult for venal politicians\r\nand major tax evaders. The likes of Sani Abacha (late\r\nPresident of Nigeria), Ferdinand Marcos (late President of\r\nthe Philippines), Vladimiro Montesinos (former, now\r\nstanding trial, chief of the intelligence services of Peru),\r\nor Raul Salinas (the brother of Mexico's President) -\r\nwould have found it impossible to loot their countries to\r\nthe same disgraceful extent in today's financial\r\nenvironment. And Osama bin Laden would not have been\r\nable to wire funds to US accounts from the Sudanese Al\r\nShamal Bank, the \"correspondent\" of 33 American banks.\r\n\r\nQuo Vadis, Money Laundering?\r\nCrime is resilient and fast adapting to new realities.\r\n\r\nOrganized crime is in the process of establishing an\r\nalternative banking system, only tangentially connected to\r\nthe West's, in the fringes, and by proxy. This is done by\r\npurchasing defunct banks or banking licences in territories\r\nwith lax regulation, cash economies, corrupt politicians,\r\nno tax collection, but reasonable infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe countries of Eastern Europe - Yugoslavia\r\n(Montenegro and Serbia), Macedonia, Ukraine, Moldova,\r\nBelarus, Albania, to mention a few - are natural targets. In\r\nsome cases, organized crime is so all-pervasive and local\r\npoliticians so corrupt that the distinction between criminal\r\nand politician is spurious.\r\n\r\nGradually, money laundering rings move their operations\r\nto these new, accommodating territories. The laundered\r\nfunds are used to purchase assets in intentionally botched\r\nprivatizations, real estate, existing businesses, and to\r\nfinance trading operations. The wasteland that is Eastern\r\nEurope craves private capital and no questions are asked\r\nby investor and recipient alike.\r\n\r\nThe next frontier is cyberspace. Internet banking, Internet\r\ngambling, day trading, foreign exchange cyber\r\ntransactions, e-cash, e-commerce, fictitious invoicing of\r\nthe launderer's genuine credit cards - hold the promise of\r\nthe future. Impossible to track and monitor, ex-territorial,\r\ntotally digital, amenable to identity theft and fake\r\nidentities - this is the ideal vehicle for money launderers.\r\n\r\nThis nascent platform is way too small to accommodate\r\nthe enormous amounts of cash laundered daily - but in ten\r\nyears time, it may. The problem is likely to be\r\nexacerbated by the introduction of smart cards, electronic\r\npurses, and payment-enabled mobile phones.\r\n\r\nIn its \"Report on Money Laundering Typologies\"\r\n(February 2001) the FATF was able to document concrete\r\nand suspected abuses of online banking, Internet casinos,\r\nand web-based financial services. It is difficult to identify\r\na customer and to get to know it in cyberspace, was the\r\nalarming conclusion. It is equally complicated to establish\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\nMany capable professionals - stockbrokers, lawyers,\r\naccountants, traders, insurance brokers, real estate agents,\r\nsellers of high value items such as gold, diamonds, and art\r\n- are employed or co-opted by money laundering\r\noperations. Money launderers are likely to make increased\r\nuse of global, around the clock, trading in foreign\r\ncurrencies and derivatives. These provide instantaneous\r\ntransfer of funds and no audit trail.\r\n\r\nThe underlying securities involved are susceptible to\r\nmarket manipulation and fraud. Complex insurance\r\npolicies (with the \"wrong\" beneficiaries), and the\r\nsecuritization of receivables, leasing contracts, mortgages,\r\nand low grade bonds are already used in money\r\nlaundering schemes. In general, money laundering goes\r\nwell with risk arbitraging financial instruments.\r\n\r\nTrust-based, globe-spanning, money transfer systems\r\nbased on authentication codes and generations of\r\ncommercial relationships cemented in honour and blood -\r\nare another wave of the future. The Hawala and Chinese\r\nnetworks in Asia, the Black Market Peso Exchange\r\n(BMPE) in Latin America, other evolving courier systems\r\nin Eastern Europe (mainly in Russia, Ukraine, and\r\nAlbania) and in Western Europe (mainly in France and\r\nSpain).\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with encrypted e-mail and web\r\nanonymizers, these networks are virtually impenetrable.\r\n\r\nAs emigration increases, diasporas established, and\r\ntransport and telecommunications become ubiquitous,\r\n\"ethnic banking\" along the tradition of the Lombards and\r\nthe Jews in medieval Europe may become the the\r\npreferred venue of money laundering. September 11 may\r\nhave retarded world civilization in more than one way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Hawala, or The Bank that Never Was\r\n\r\n\r\nI. OVERVIEW\r\nIn the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the\r\nUSA, attention was drawn to the age-old, secretive, and\r\nglobe-spanning banking system developed in Asia and\r\nknown as \"Hawala\" (to change, in Arabic). It is based on a\r\nshort term, discountable, negotiable, promissory note (or\r\nbill of exchange) called \"Hundi\". While not limited to\r\nMoslems, it has come to be identified with \"Islamic\r\nBanking\".\r\n\r\nIslamic Law (Sharia'a) regulates commerce and finance in\r\nthe Fiqh Al Mua'malat, (transactions amongst people).\r\n\r\nModern Islamic banks are overseen by the Shari'a\r\nSupervisory Board of Islamic Banks and Institutions\r\n(\"The Shari'a Committee\").\r\n\r\nThe Shi'a \"Islamic Laws according to the Fatawa of\r\nAyatullah al Uzama Syed Ali al-Husaini Seestani\" has this\r\nto say about Hawala banking:\r\n\"2298. If a debtor directs his creditor to collect his debt\r\nfrom the third person, and the creditor accepts the\r\narrangement, the third person will, on completion of all\r\nthe conditions to be explained later, become the debtor.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the creditor cannot demand his debt from the\r\nfirst debtor\".\r\n\r\nThe prophet Muhammad (a cross border trader of goods\r\nand commodities by profession) encouraged the free\r\nmovement of goods and the development of markets.\r\n\r\nNumerous Moslem scholars railed against hoarding and\r\nharmful speculation (market cornering and manipulation\r\nknown as \"Gharar\"). Moslems were the first to use\r\npromissory notes and assignment, or transfer of debts via\r\nbills of exchange (\"Hawala\"). Among modern banking\r\ninstruments, only floating and, therefore, uncertain,\r\ninterest payments (\"Riba\" and \"Jahala\"), futures contracts,\r\nand forfeiting are frowned upon. But agile Moslem traders\r\neasily and often circumvent these religious restrictions by\r\ncreating \"synthetic Murabaha (contracts)\" identical to\r\nWestern forward and futures contracts. Actually, the only\r\nallowed transfer or trading of debts (as distinct from the\r\nunderlying commodities or goods) is under the Hawala.\r\n\"Hawala\" consists of transferring money (usually across\r\nborders and in order to avoid taxes or the need to bribe\r\nofficials) without physical or electronic transfer of funds.\r\n\r\nMoney changers (\"Hawaladar\") receive cash in one\r\ncountry, no questions asked. Correspondent hawaladars in\r\nanother country dispense an identical amount (minus\r\nminimal fees and commissions) to a recipient or, less\r\noften, to a bank account. E-mail, or letter (\"Hundi\")\r\ncarrying couriers are used to convey the necessary\r\ninformation (the amount of money, the date it has to be\r\npaid on) between Hawaladars. The sender provides the\r\nrecipient with code words (or numbers, for instance the\r\nserial numbers of currency notes), a digital encrypted\r\nmessage, or agreed signals (like handshakes), to be used\r\nto retrieve the money. Big Hawaladars use a chain of\r\nmiddlemen in cities around the globe.\r\n\r\nBut most Hawaladars are small businesses. Their Hawala\r\nactivity is a sideline or moonlighting operation. \"Chits\"\r\n(verbal agreements) substitute for certain written records.\r\n\r\nIn bigger operations there are human \"memorizers\" who\r\nserve as arbiters in case of dispute. The Hawala system\r\nrequires unbounded trust. Hawaladars are often members\r\nof the same family, village, clan, or ethnic group. It is a\r\nsystem older than the West. The ancient Chinese had their\r\nown \"Hawala\" - \"fei qian\" (or \"flying money\"). Arab\r\ntraders used it to avoid being robbed on the Silk Road.\r\n\r\nCheating is punished by effective ex-communication and\r\n\"loss of honour\" - the equivalent of an economic death\r\nsentence. Physical violence is rarer but not unheard of.\r\n\r\nViolence sometimes also erupts between money recipients\r\nand robbers who are after the huge quantities of physical\r\ncash sloshing about the system. But these, too, are rare\r\nevents, as rare as bank robberies. One result of this\r\neffective social regulation is that commodity traders in\r\nAsia shift hundreds of millions of US dollars per trade\r\nbased solely on trust and the verbal commitment of their\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\nHawala arrangements are used to avoid customs duties,\r\nconsumption taxes, and other trade-related levies.\r\n\r\nSuppliers provide importers with lower prices on their\r\ninvoices, and get paid the difference via Hawala.\r\n\r\nLegitimate transactions and tax evasion constitute the bulk\r\nof Hawala operations. Modern Hawala networks emerged\r\nin the 1960's and 1970's to circumvent official bans on\r\ngold imports in Southeast Asia and to facilitate the\r\ntransfer of hard earned wages of expatriates to their\r\nfamilies (\"home remittances\") and   their conversion at\r\nrates more favourable (often double) than the\r\ngovernment's. Hawala provides a cheap (it costs c. 1% of\r\nthe amount transferred), efficient, and frictionless\r\nalternative to morbid and corrupt domestic financial\r\ninstitutions. It is Western Union without the hi-tech gear\r\nand the exorbitant transfer fees.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these networks have been hijacked and\r\ncompromised by drug traffickers (mainly in Afganistan\r\nand Pakistan), corrupt officials, secret services, money\r\nlaunderers, organized crime, and terrorists. Pakistani\r\nHawala networks alone move up to 5 billion US dollars\r\nannually according to estimates by Pakistan's Minister of\r\nFinance, Shaukut Aziz. In 1999, Institutional Investor\r\nMagazine identified 1100 money brokers in Pakistan and\r\ntransactions that ran as high as 10 million US dollars\r\napiece. As opposed to stereotypes, most Hawala networks\r\nare not controlled by Arabs, but by Indian and Pakistani\r\nexpatriates and immigrants in the Gulf. The Hawala\r\nnetwork in India has been brutally and ruthlessly\r\ndemolished by Indira Ghandi (during the emergency\r\nregime imposed in 1975), but Indian nationals still play a\r\nbig part in international Hawala networks. Similar\r\nnetworks in Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Bangladesh\r\nhave also been eradicated.\r\n\r\nThe OECD's Financial Action Task Force (FATF) says\r\nthat:\r\n\"Hawala remains a significant method for large\r\nnumbers of businesses of all sizes and individuals to\r\nrepatriate funds and purchase gold.... It is favoured\r\nbecause it usually costs less than moving funds through\r\nthe banking system, it operates 24 hours per day and\r\nevery day of the year, it is virtually completely reliable,\r\nand there is minimal paperwork required.\"\r\n(Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and\r\nDevelopment (OECD), \"Report on Money Laundering\r\nTypologies 1999-2000,\" Financial Action Task Force,\r\nFATF-XI, February 3, 2000, at\r\nhttp://www.oecd.org/fatf/pdf/TY2000_en.pdf )\r\nHawala networks closely feed into Islamic banks\r\nthroughout the world and to commodity trading in South\r\nAsia. There are more than 200 Islamic banks in the USA\r\nalone and many thousands in Europe, North and South\r\nAfrica, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states (especially in the free\r\nzone of Dubai and in Bahrain), Pakistan, Malaysia,\r\nIndonesia, and other South East Asian countries. By the\r\nend of 1998, the overt (read: tip of the iceberg) liabilities\r\nof these financial institutions amounted to 148 billion US\r\ndollars. They dabbled in equipment leasing, real estate\r\nleasing and development, corporate equity, and\r\ntrade/structured trade and commodities financing (usually\r\nin consortia called \"Mudaraba\").\r\n\r\nWhile previously confined to the Arab peninsula and to\r\nsouth and east Asia, this mode of traditional banking\r\nbecame truly international in the 1970's, following the\r\nunprecedented flow of wealth to many Moslem nations\r\ndue to the oil shocks and the emergence of the Asian\r\ntigers. Islamic banks joined forces with corporations,\r\nmultinationals, and banks in the West to finance oil\r\nexploration and drilling, mining, and agribusiness. Many\r\nleading law firms in the West (such as Norton Rose,\r\nFreshfields, Clyde and Co. and Clifford Chance) have\r\n\"Islamic Finance\" teams which are familiar with Islam-\r\ncompatible commercial contracts.\r\n\r\nII. HAWALA AND TERRORISM\r\nRecent anti-terrorist legislation in the US and the UK\r\nallows government agencies to regularly supervise and\r\ninspect businesses that are suspected of being a front for\r\nthe ''Hawala'' banking system, makes it a crime to\r\nsmuggle more than $10,000 in cash across USA borders,\r\nand empowers the Treasury secretary (and its Financial\r\nCrimes Enforcement Network - FinCEN) to tighten\r\nrecord-keeping and reporting rules for banks and financial\r\ninstitutions based in the USA. A new inter-agency Foreign\r\nTerrorist Asset Tracking Center (FTAT) was set up. A\r\n1993 moribund proposed law requiring US-based\r\nHalawadar to register and to report suspicious transactions\r\nmay be revived. These relatively radical measures reflect\r\nthe belief that the al-Qaida network of Osama bin Laden\r\nuses the Hawala system to raise and move funds across\r\nnational borders. A Hawaladar in Pakistan (Dihab Shill)\r\nwas identified as the financier in the attacks on the\r\nAmerican embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.\r\n\r\nBut the USA is not the only country to face terrorism\r\nfinanced by Hawala networks.\r\n\r\nIn mid-2001, the Delhi police, the Indian government's\r\nEnforcement Directorate (ED), and the Military\r\nIntelligence (MI) arrested six Jammu Kashmir Islamic\r\nFront (JKIF) terrorists. The arrests led to the exposure of\r\nan enormous web of Hawala institutions in Delhi, aided\r\nand abetted, some say, by the ISI (Inter Services\r\nIntelligence, Pakistan's security services). The Hawala\r\nnetwork was used to funnel money to terrorist groups in\r\nthe disputed Kashmir Valley.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the common perception that Hawala financing is\r\npaperless is wrong. The transfer of information regarding\r\nthe funds often leaves digital (though heavily encrypted)\r\ntrails. Couriers and \"contract memorizers\", gold dealers,\r\ncommodity merchants, transporters, and moneylenders\r\ncan be apprehended and interrogated. Written, physical,\r\nletters are still the favourite mode of communication\r\namong small and medium Hawaladars, who also\r\ninvariably resort to extremely detailed single entry\r\nbookkeeping.  And the sudden appearance and\r\ndisappearance of funds in bank accounts still have to be\r\nexplained. Moreover, the sheer scale of the amounts\r\ninvolved entails the collaboration of off shore banks and\r\nmore established financial institutions in the West. Such\r\nflows of funds affect the local money markets in Asia and\r\nare instantaneously reflected in interest rates charged to\r\nfrequent borrowers, such as wholesalers. Spending and\r\nconsumption patterns change discernibly after such\r\ninfluxes. Most of the money ends up in prime world banks\r\nbehind flimsy business facades. Hackers in Germany\r\nclaimed (without providing proof) to have infiltrated\r\nHawala-related bank accounts.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that banks and financial institutions - and\r\nnot only in dodgy offshore havens (\"black holes\" in the\r\nlingo) - clam up and refuse to divulge information about\r\ntheir clients. Banking is largely a matter of fragile trust\r\nbetween bank and customer and tight secrecy. Bankers are\r\nreluctant to undermine either. Banks use mainframe\r\ncomputers which can rarely be hacked through cyberspace\r\nand can be compromised only physically in close co-\r\noperation with insiders. The shadier the bank - the more\r\nformidable its digital defenses. The use of numbered\r\naccounts (outlawed in Austria, for instance, only recently)\r\nand pseudonyms (still possible in Lichtenstein)\r\ncomplicates matters. Bin Laden's accounts are unlikely to\r\nbear his name. He has collaborators.\r\n\r\nHawala networks are often used to launder money, or to\r\nevade taxes. Even when employed for legitimate\r\npurposes, to diversify the risk involved in the transfer of\r\nlarge sums, Hawaladars apply techniques borrowed from\r\nmoney laundering. Deposits are fragmented and wired to\r\nhundreds of banks the world over (\"starburst\").\r\n\r\nSometimes, the money ends up in the account of origin\r\n(\"boomerang\").\r\n\r\nHence the focus on payment clearing and settlement\r\nsystems. Most countries have only one such system, the\r\nrepository of  data regarding all banking (and most non-\r\nbanking) transactions in the country. Yet, even this is a\r\npartial solution. Most national systems maintain records\r\nfor 6-12 months, private settlement and clearing systems\r\nfor even less.\r\n\r\nYet, the crux of the problem is not the Hawala or the\r\nHawaladars. The corrupt and inept governments of Asia\r\nare to blame for not regulating their banking systems, for\r\nover-regulating everything else, for not fostering\r\ncompetition, for throwing public money at bad debts and\r\nat worse borrowers, for over-taxing, for robbing people of\r\ntheir life savings through capital controls, for tearing at\r\nthe delicate fabric of trust between customer and bank\r\n(Pakistan, for instance, froze all foreign exchange\r\naccounts two years ago). Perhaps if Asia had reasonably\r\nexpedient, reasonably priced, reasonably regulated, user-\r\nfriendly banks - Osama bin Laden would have found it\r\nimpossible to finance his mischief so invisibly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Straf - Corruption in Central and Eastern Europe\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three policemen barked \"straf\", \"straf\" in unison. It\r\nwas a Russianized version of the German word for \"fine\"\r\nand a euphemism for bribe. I and my fianće were\r\nstranded in an empty ally at the heart of Moscow,\r\nphysically encircled by these young bullies, an ominous\r\npropinquity. They held my passport ransom and began to\r\ndrag me to a police station nearby. We paid.\r\n\r\nTo do the fashionable thing and to hold the moral high\r\nground is rare. Yet, denouncing corruption and fighting it\r\nsatisfies both conditions. Such hectoring is usually the\r\npreserve of well-heeled bureaucrats, driving utility\r\nvehicles and banging away at wireless laptops. The\r\nGeneral Manager of the IMF makes 400,000 US dollars a\r\nyear, tax-free, and perks. This is the equivalent of 2,300\r\n(!) monthly salaries of a civil servant in Macedonia - or\r\n7,000 monthly salaries of a teacher or a doctor in\r\nYugoslavia, Moldova, Belarus, or Albania. He flies only\r\nfirst class and each one of his air tickets is worth the bi-\r\nannual income of a Macedonian factory worker. His\r\nshareholders - among them poor and developing countries\r\n- are forced to cough up these exorbitant fees and to\r\nfinance the luxurious lifestyle of the likes of Kohler and\r\nWolfensohn. And then they are made to listen to the IMF\r\nlecture them on belt tightening and how uncompetitive\r\ntheir economies are due to their expensive labour force.\r\n\r\nTo me, such a double standard is the epitome of\r\ncorruption. Organizations such as the IMF and World\r\nBank will never be possessed of a shred of moral\r\nauthority in these parts of the world unless and until they\r\nforgo their conspicuous consumption.\r\n\r\nYet, corruption is not a monolithic practice. Nor are its\r\noutcomes universally deplorable or damaging. One would\r\ndo best to adopt a utilitarian and discerning approach to it.\r\n\r\nThe advent of moral relativism has taught us that \"right\"\r\nand \"wrong\" are flexible, context dependent and culture-\r\nsensitive yardsticks.\r\n\r\nWhat amounts to venality in one culture (Slovenia) is\r\nconsidered no more than gregariousness or hospitality in\r\nanother (Macedonia).\r\n\r\nMoreover, corruption is often \"imported\" by\r\nmultinationals, foreign investors, and expats. It is\r\nintroduced by them to all levels of governments, often in\r\norder to expedite matters or secure a beneficial outcome.\r\n\r\nTo eradicate corruption, one must tackle both giver and\r\ntaker.\r\n\r\nThus, we are better off asking \"cui bono\" than \"is it the\r\nright thing to do\". Phenomenologically, \"corruption\" is a\r\ncommon - and misleading - label for a group of\r\nbehaviours. One of the following criteria must apply:\r\n(a) The withholding of a service, information, or goods\r\nthat, by law, and by right, should have been provided or\r\ndivulged.\r\n\r\nTo have a phone installed in Russia one must openly bribe\r\nthe installer (according to a rather rigid tariff). In many of\r\nthe former republics of Yugoslavia, it is impossible to\r\nobtain statistics or other data (the salaries of senior public\r\nofficeholders, for instance) without resorting to kickbacks.\r\n(b) The provision of a service, information, or goods that,\r\nby law, and by right, should not have been provided or\r\ndivulged.\r\n\r\nTenders in the Czech Republic are often won through\r\nbribery. The botched privatizations all over the former\r\nEastern Bloc constitute a massive transfer of wealth to\r\nselect members of a nomenklatura. Licences and\r\nconcessions are often granted in Bulgaria and the rest of\r\nthe Balkan as means of securing political allegiance or\r\npaying off old political \"debts\".\r\n(c) That the withholding or the provision of said service,\r\ninformation, or goods are in the power of the withholder\r\nor the provider to withhold or to provide AND That the\r\nwithholding or the provision of said service, information,\r\nor goods constitute an integral and substantial part of the\r\nauthority or the function of the withholder or the provider.\r\n\r\nThe post-communist countries in transition are a\r\ndichotomous lot. On the one hand, they are intensely and\r\nstiflingly bureaucratic. On the other hand, none of the\r\ninstitutions functions properly or lawfully. While these\r\ncountries are LEGALISTIC - they are never LAWFUL.\r\n\r\nThis fuzziness allows officials in all ranks to usurp\r\nauthority, to trade favours, to forge illegal consensus and\r\nto dodge criticism and accountability. There is a direct\r\nline between lack of transparency and venality. Eran\r\nFraenkel of Search for Common Ground in Macedonia\r\nhas coined the phrase \"ambient corruption\" to capture this\r\ncomplex of features.\r\n(d) That the service, information, or goods that are\r\nprovided or divulged are provided or divulged against a\r\nbenefit or the promise of a benefit from the recipient and\r\nas a result of the receipt of this specific benefit or the\r\npromise to receive such benefit.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to assume that corruption is necessarily, or\r\neven mostly, monetary or pecuniary. Corruption is built\r\non mutual expectations. The reasonable expectation of a\r\nfuture benefit is, in itself, a benefit. Access, influence\r\npeddling, property rights, exclusivity, licences, permits, a\r\njob, a recommendation - all constitute benefits.\r\n(e) That the service, information, or goods that are\r\nwithheld are withheld because no benefit was provided or\r\npromised by the recipient.\r\n\r\nEven then, in CEE, we can distinguish between a few\r\ntypes of corrupt and venal behaviours in accordance with\r\ntheir OUTCOMES (utilities):\r\n(1) Income Supplement\r\nCorrupt actions whose sole outcome is the supplementing\r\nof the income of the provider without affecting the \"real\r\nworld\" in any manner.\r\n\r\nThough the perception of corruption itself is a negative\r\noutcome - it is so only when corruption does not\r\nconstitute an acceptable and normative part of the playing\r\nfield. When corruption becomes institutionalised - it also\r\nbecomes predictable and is easily and seamlessly\r\nincorporated into decision making processes of all\r\neconomic players and moral agents. They develop \"by-\r\npasses\" and \"techniques\" which allow them to restore an\r\nefficient market equilibrium. In a way, all-pervasive\r\ncorruption is transparent and, thus, a form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThis is the most common form of corruption exercised by\r\nlow and mid-ranking civil servants, party hacks and\r\nmunicipal politicians throughout the CEE.\r\n\r\nMore than avarice, the motivating force here is sheer\r\nsurvival. The acts of corruption are repetitive, structured\r\nand in strict accordance with an un-written tariff and code\r\nof conduct.\r\n(2) Acceleration Fees\r\nCorrupt practices whose sole outcome is to\r\nACCELERATE decision making, the provision of goods\r\nand services or the divulging of information. None of the\r\noutcomes or the utility functions are altered. Only the\r\nspeed of the economic dynamics is altered. This kind of\r\ncorruption is actually economically BENEFICIAL. It is a\r\nlimited transfer of wealth (or tax) which increases\r\nefficiency. This is not to say that bureaucracies and venal\r\nofficialdoms, over-regulation and intrusive political\r\ninvolvement in the workings of the marketplace are good\r\n(efficient) things. They are not. But if the choice is\r\nbetween a slow, obstructive and passive-aggressive civil\r\nservice and a more forthcoming and accommodating one\r\n(the result of bribery) - the latter is preferable.\r\n\r\nAcceleration fees are collected mostly by mid-ranking\r\nbureaucrats and middle rung decision makers in both the\r\npolitical echelons and the civil service.\r\n(3) Decision Altering Fees\r\nThis is where the line is crossed from the point of view of\r\naggregate utility. When bribes and promises of bribes\r\nactually alter outcomes in the real world - a less than\r\noptimal allocation of resources and distribution of means\r\nof production is obtained. The result is a fall in the general\r\nlevel of production. The many is hurt by the few. The\r\neconomy is skewed and economic outcomes are distorted.\r\n\r\nThis kind of corruption should be uprooted on utilitarian\r\ngrounds as well as on moral ones.\r\n(4) Subversive Outcomes\r\nSome corrupt collusions lead to the subversion of the flow\r\nof information within a society or an economic unit.\r\n\r\nWrong information often leads to disastrous outcomes.\r\n\r\nConsider a medical doctor or an civil engineer who bribed\r\ntheir way into obtaining a professional diploma.\r\n\r\nHuman lives are at stake. The wrong information, in this\r\ncase is the professional validity of the diplomas granted\r\nand the scholarship (knowledge) that such certificates\r\nstand for. But the outcomes are lost lives. This kind of\r\ncorruption, of course, is by far the most damaging.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is widespread in CEE. It is proof of the\r\ncollapse of the social treaty, of social solidarity and of the\r\nfraying of the social fabric.\r\n\r\nNo Western country accepts CEE diplomas without\r\nfurther accreditation, studies and examinations. Many\r\n\"medical doctors\" and \"engineers\" who emigrated to\r\nIsrael from Russia and the former republics of the USSR -\r\nwere suspiciously deficient professionally. Israel was\r\nforced to re-educate them prior to granting them a licence\r\nto practice locally.\r\n(5) Reallocation Fees\r\nBenefits paid (mainly to politicians and political decision\r\nmakers) in order to affect the allocation of economic\r\nresources and material wealth or the rights thereto.\r\n\r\nConcessions, licences, permits, assets privatised, tenders\r\nawarded are all subject to reallocation fees. Here the\r\ndamage is materially enormous (and visible) but, because\r\nit is widespread, it is \"diluted\" in individual terms. Still, it\r\nis often irreversible (like when a sold asset is purposefully\r\nunder-valued) and pernicious. a factory sold to avaricious\r\nand criminally minded managers is likely to collapse and\r\nleave its workers unemployed.\r\n\r\nCorruption pervades daily life even in the prim and often\r\nhectoring countries of the West. It is a win-win game (as\r\nfar as Game Theory goes) - hence its attraction. We are all\r\ncorrupt to varying degrees. But it is wrong and wasteful -\r\nreally, counterproductive - to fight corruption in CEE in a\r\nwide front and indiscriminately.  It is the kind of\r\ncorruption whose evil outcomes outweigh its benefits that\r\nshould be fought. This fine (and blurred) distinction is too\r\noften lost on decision makers and law enforcement\r\nagencies in both East and West.\r\n\r\nERADICATING CORRUPTION\r\nAn effective program to eradicate corruption must include\r\nthe following elements:\r\n1. Egregiously corrupt, high-profile, public figures,\r\nmultinationals, and institutions (domestic and\r\nforeign) must be singled out for harsh (legal)\r\ntreatment and thus demonstrate that no one is\r\nabove the law and that crime does not pay.\r\n2. All international aid, credits, and investments must\r\nbe conditioned upon a clear, performance-based,\r\nplan to reduce corruption levels and intensity.\r\n\r\nSuch a plan should be monitored and revised as\r\nneeded. Corruption retards development and\r\nproduces instability by undermining the\r\ncredentials of democracy, state institutions, and\r\nthe political class. Reduced corruption is,\r\ntherefore, a major target of economic and\r\ninstitutional developmental.\r\n3. Corruption cannot be reduced only by punitive\r\nmeasures. A system of incentives to avoid\r\ncorruption must be established. Such incentives\r\nshould include a higher pay, the fostering of civic\r\npride, educational campaigns, \"good behaviour\"\r\nbonuses, alternative income and pension plans,\r\nand so on.\r\n4. Opportunities to be corrupt should be minimized\r\nby liberalizing and deregulating the economy. Red\r\ntape should be minimized, licensing abolished,\r\ninternational trade freed, capital controls\r\neliminated, competition introduced, monopolies\r\nbroken, transparent public tendering be made\r\nmandatory, freedom of information enshrined, the\r\nmedia should be directly supported by the\r\ninternational community, and so on. Deregulation\r\nshould be a developmental target integral to every\r\nprogram of international aid, investment, or credit\r\nprovision.\r\n5. Corruption is a symptom of systemic institutional\r\nfailure. Corruption guarantees efficiency and\r\nfavourable outcomes. The strengthening of\r\ninstitutions is of critical importance. The police,\r\nthe customs, the courts, the government, its\r\nagencies, the tax authorities, the state owned\r\nmedia - all must be subjected to a massive\r\noverhaul. Such a process may require foreign\r\nmanagement and supervision for a limited period\r\nof time. It most probably would entail the\r\nreplacement of most of the current - irredeemably\r\ncorrupt - personnel. It would need to be open to\r\npublic scrutiny.\r\n6. Corruption is a symptom of an all-pervasive sense\r\nof helplessness. The citizen (or investor, or firm)\r\nfeels dwarfed by the overwhelming and capricious\r\npowers of the state. It is through corruption and\r\nvenality that the balance is restored. To minimize\r\nthis imbalance, potential participants in corrupt\r\ndealings must be made to feel that they are real\r\nand effective stakeholders in their societies. A\r\nprocess of public debate coupled with\r\ntransparency and the establishment of just\r\ndistributive mechanisms will go a long way\r\ntowards rendering corruption obsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. The Kleptocracies of the East\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process of transition from communism to capitalism\r\nwas largely hijacked either by outright criminals in\r\nbudding outfits of organized crime - or by pernicious and\r\nall-pervasive kleptocracies: politicians and political\r\nparties bent on looting the state and suppressing the\r\nopposition, sometimes fatally.\r\n\r\nIn the past 16 years, industrial production in the\r\neconomies in transition tumbled in real terms by more\r\nthan 60 percent. The monthly salary in the poorer bits\r\nequals the daily wage of a skilled German industrial\r\nworker, or one seventh the European Union's average.\r\n\r\nGross domestic product per capita is less than one third\r\nthe EU's. Infrastructure, internal and export markets, state\r\ninstitutions - all crumbled with dizzying speed.\r\n\r\nIn some countries - not the least Russia - privatization\r\namounted to a mass transfer of assets to cronies and\r\ninsiders, often well-connected members of the communist\r\nnomenclature: managers, members of the security services\r\nand other penumbral figures. Laws were passed and\r\ninstitutions tweaked to reflect the special interests of these\r\ngroupings.\r\n\"Classical\" forms of crime flourished throughout the\r\nbenighted region. Prostitution, gambling, drugs,\r\nsmuggling, kidnapping, organ trafficking and other\r\nvarieties of delinquency yielded to their perpetrators\r\nbillions of dollars annually. In the impoverished\r\neconomies of the east, these fantastic revenues - laundered\r\nthrough off shore accounts - were leveraged by criminals\r\nto garner political favors, to buy into legitimate businesses\r\nand to infiltrate civil society.\r\n\r\nNone of this is new to Western publics. Rogues and\r\n\"robber barons\" have always doubled as entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThe oil, gaming and railways industries in America, for\r\ninstance, owe their existence to dubious personas and\r\nquestionable practices. Well into the 17th century, the\r\nBritish sovereign maintained a monopoly on chartering\r\nbusinesses and awarded the coveted licenses to loyal\r\nservants and obsequious sycophants.\r\n\r\nStill, the ubiquity of crime in east Europe and its reach are\r\nunprecedented in European annals. In the void-like\r\ninterregnum between centrally planned and free market\r\neconomies only criminals, politicians, managers, and\r\nemployees of the security services were positioned to\r\nbenefit from the upheaval.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of transition, the underworld constituted an\r\nembryonic private sector, replete with international\r\nnetworks of contacts, cross-border experience, capital\r\nagglomeration and wealth formation, sources of venture\r\n(risk) capital, an entrepreneurial spirit, and a diversified\r\nportfolio of investments and revenue generating assets.\r\n\r\nCriminals were used to private sector practices: price\r\nsignals, competition, joint venturing, and third party\r\ndispute settlement.\r\n\r\nCrime - alone among all economic activities in communist\r\nsocieties - obeyed the laws of the free market. Criminals\r\nhad to be entrepreneurial and profitable to survive. Their\r\ninstincts sharpened by - often lethal - competition, they\r\nwere never corrupted by central planning.\r\n\r\nDeprived of access to state largesse, criminals invested\r\ntheir own capital in efficiently-run small to medium size\r\nenterprises. Attuned to the needs and wishes of their\r\ncustomers, criminals engaged in primitive forms of\r\nmarket research, through neighborhood and grassroots\r\n\"pollsters\" and \"activists\". They responded with agility\r\nand in real time to changes in the patterns of supply and\r\ndemand by altering their product mix and their pricing.\r\n\r\nThey have always been pioneers of bleeding-edge\r\ntechnologies.\r\n\r\nCriminals are effective organizers and managers. They\r\nexcel at enforcing workplace discipline with irresistible\r\nincentives and irreversible disincentives, at setting targets\r\nand at networking. The superior felonious echelons are\r\nupwardly mobile and have a clear career path. Every\r\nmanagement fad - from territorially exclusive franchises\r\nto  \"stock\" options - has been invented by criminals long\r\nbefore they triumphed in the boardroom.\r\n\r\nIn east Europe, criminals on all levels, from the organized\r\nto the petty, often substituted for the dysfunctional, or\r\nideologically hidebound organs of the state. Consider the\r\ndispensation of justice. The criminal code of conduct and\r\ncourt system replaced the compromised and lethargic\r\nofficial judiciary. Debt collectors and enforcers stood in\r\nfor venal and incompetent police forces.\r\n\r\nCrime is a growth industry and sustains hordes of\r\nprofessionals: accountants and lawyers, forgers and cross\r\nborder guides, weapons experts and bankers, mechanics\r\nand hit-men. Expertise, know-how and acumen, amassed\r\nover centuries of practice, are taught in the criminal\r\nuniversities known as penitentiaries: roads less traveled,\r\ncountries more lenient, passports to be bought, sold, or\r\nforged, how-to manuals, goods and services on offer and\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nProfit margins in crime are outlandish and lead to feverish\r\nwealth accumulation. The banking system is used both to\r\nstash the proceeds and to launder them. Tax havens, off\r\nshore financial institutions and money couriers - all form\r\npart of a global web. Thus cleansed and rendered\r\nuntraceable, the money is invested in legitimate activities.\r\n\r\nIn some countries - especially on the drug path, or on the\r\ntrail of white slavery - crime is a major engine of\r\neconomic growth.\r\n\r\nAs opposed to the visible sectors of the east's demonetized\r\neconomies, criminal enterprises never run out of liquidity\r\nand thus are always keen to invest. Moreover, crime is\r\ninternational and cosmopolitan. It is accustomed to\r\nsophisticated export-import transactions.\r\n\r\nMany criminals - as opposed to the vast majority of their\r\ncountrymen - are polyglottal, well-traveled, aware of\r\nworld prices, the international financial system and\r\ndemand and supply in various markets. They are\r\nexperienced negotiators. In short: criminals are well-\r\nheeled international businessmen, well-connected both\r\nabroad and with the various indigenous elites.\r\n\r\nThe Wild East in Europe is often compared to the Wild\r\nWest in America a century or so ago. The Russian\r\noligarchs, goes the soothing analogy, are local versions of\r\nMorgan, Rockefeller, Pullman and Vanderbilt. But this\r\naffinity is spurious. the United States always had a civic\r\nculture with civic values and an aspiration to, ultimately,\r\ncreate a harmonious and benevolent civic society.\r\n\r\nCriminality was regarded as a shameful stepping stone on\r\nthe way to an orderly community of learned, civilized,\r\nlaw-abiding citizens.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be said about Russia, for instance. The\r\ncriminal there is, if anything, admired and emulated. Even\r\nthe language of legal business in countries in transition is\r\nsuffused with underworld parlance. There is no - and\r\nnever was - a civic tradition in the countries of eastern\r\nEurope, a Bill of Rights, a veritable Constitution, a\r\nmodicum of self rule, a true abolition of classes and\r\nnomenclatures. These territories are accustomed to being\r\ngoverned by paranoiac and murderous tyrants akin to the\r\ncurrent crop of delinquents. That some criminals are\r\nmembers of the new political, financial and industrial\r\nelites (and vice versa) - tends to support this long-rooted\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nIn all the countries of the region, politicians and managers\r\nabuse the state and its simulacrum institutions in close\r\nsymbiosis with felons. Patronage and sinecures extend to\r\ncollaborating lawbreakers. Veritable villains gain access\r\nto state owned assets and resources in a cycle of money\r\nlaundering.  Law enforcement agencies and the courts are\r\n\"encouraged\" to turn a blind eye, or even to help criminals\r\neliminate internal and external competition in their turf.\r\n\r\nCriminals, in return, serve as the \"long and anonymous\r\narm\" of politicians, obtaining for them illicit goods, or\r\nproviding \"black\" services. Corruption often flows\r\nthrough criminal channels or via the mediation and\r\nconduit of delinquents. Within the shared sphere of the\r\ninformal economy, assets are shifted among these\r\neconomic players. Both players oppose attempts at reform\r\nand transparency and encourage - even engender -\r\nnationalism and racism, paranoias and grievances to\r\nrecruit foot soldiers.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there is the irrepressible urge to become\r\nlegitimate. Politicians, who grope for a new ideological\r\ncover for their opportunism, partner with legitimacy-\r\nseeking, established crime lords. Both groups benefit from\r\na swelling economic pie. They fight against other, less\r\nsuccessful, criminals, who wish to persist in their old\r\nways and, thus, hamper economic growth. The battle is\r\nnever won but at least it succeeds to firmly drive crime\r\nwhere it belongs: underground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. FIMACO - Russia's Missing Billions\r\n\r\n\r\nRussia's Audit Chamber - with the help of the Swiss\r\nauthorities and their host of dedicated investigators - may\r\nbe about to solve a long standing mystery. An\r\nannouncement by the Prosecutor's General Office is said\r\nto be imminent. The highest echelons of the Yeltsin\r\nentourage - perhaps even Yeltsin himself - may be\r\nimplicated - or exonerated. A Russian team has been\r\nspending the better part of the last two months poring over\r\ndocuments and interviewing witnesses in Switzerland,\r\nFrance, Italy, and other European countries.\r\n\r\nAbout $4.8 billion of IMF funds are alleged to have gone\r\namiss during the implosion of the Russian financial\r\nmarkets in August 1998. They were supposed to prop up\r\nthe banking system (especially SBS-Agro) and the ailing\r\nand sharply devalued ruble. Instead, they ended up in the\r\nbank accounts of obscure corporations - and, then,\r\nincredibly, vanished into thin air.\r\n\r\nThe person in charge of the funds in 1998 was none other\r\nthan Mikhail Kasyanov, Russia's current Prime Minister -\r\nat the time, Deputy Minister of Finance for External Debt.\r\n\r\nHis signature on all foreign exchange transactions - even\r\nthose handled by the central bank - was mandatory. In\r\nJuly 2000, he was flatly accused by the Italian daily, La\r\nReppublica, of authorizing the diversion of the disputed\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nFollowing public charges made by US Treasury Secretary\r\nRobert Rubin as early as March 1999, both Russian and\r\nAmerican media delved deeply over the years into the\r\naffair. Communist Duma Deputy Viktor Ilyukhin jumped\r\non the bandwagon citing an obscure \"trustworthy foreign\r\nsource\" to substantiate his indictment of Kremlin cronies\r\nand oligarchs contained in an open letter to the Prosecutor\r\nGeneral, Yuri Skuratov.\r\n\r\nThe money trail from the Federal Reserve Bank of New\r\nYork to Swiss and German subsidiaries of the Russian\r\ncentral Bank was comprehensively reconstructed. Still,\r\nthe former Chairman of the central bank, Sergei Dubinin,\r\ncalled Ilyukhin's allegations and the ensuing Swiss\r\ninvestigations - \"a black PR campaign ... a lie\".\r\n\r\nOthers pointed to an outlandish coincidence: the ruble\r\ncollapsed twice in Russia's post-Communist annals. Once,\r\nin 1994, when Dubinin was Minister of Finance and was\r\nforced to resign. The second time was in 1998, when\r\nDubinin was governor of the central bank and was, again,\r\nousted.\r\n\r\nDubinin himself seems to be unable to make up his mind.\r\n\r\nIn one interview he says that IMF funds were used to prop\r\nup the ruble - in others, that they went into \"the national\r\npot\" (i.e., the Ministry of Finance, to cover a budgetary\r\nshortfall).\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of the Federation Council at the time,\r\nYegor Stroev, appointed an investigative committee in\r\n1999. Its report remains classified but Stroev confirmed\r\nthat IMF funds were embezzled in the wake of the 1998\r\nforced devaluation of the ruble.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion was weakly disowned by Eleonora\r\nMitrofanova, an auditor within the Duma's Audit\r\nChamber who said that they discovered nothing \"strictly\r\nillegal\" - though, incongruously, she accused the central\r\nbank of suppressing the Chamber's damning report. The\r\nChairman of the Chamber of Accounts, Khachim\r\nKarmokov, quoted by PwC, said that \"the audits\r\nperformed by the Chamber revealed no serious procedural\r\nbreaches in the bank's performance\".\r\n\r\nBut Nikolai Gonchar, a Duma Deputy and member of its\r\nBudget Committee, came close to branding both as liars\r\nwhen he said that he read a copy of the Audit Chamber\r\nreport and that it found that central bank funds were\r\nsiphoned off to commercial accounts in foreign banks.\r\n\r\nThe Moscow Times cited a second Audit Chamber report\r\nwhich revealed that the central bank was simultaneously\r\nselling dollars for rubles and extending ruble loans to a\r\nfew well-connected commercial banks, thus subsidizing\r\ntheir dollar purchases. The central bank went as far as\r\nprinting rubles to fuel this lucrative arbitrage. The dollars\r\ncame from IMF disbursements.\r\n\r\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, based on its own\r\nsources and an article in the Russian weekly \"Novaya\r\nGazeta\", claims that half the money was almost instantly\r\ndiverted to shell companies in Sydney and London. The\r\nother half was mostly transferred to the Bank of New\r\nYork and to Credit Suisse.\r\n\r\nWhy were additional IMF funds transferred to a chaotic\r\nRussia, despite warnings by many and a testimony by a\r\nRussian official that previous tranches were squandered?\r\nMoreover, why was the money sent to the Central Bank,\r\nthen embroiled in a growing scandal over the\r\nmanipulation of treasury bills, known as GKO's and other\r\ndebt instruments, the OFZ's - and not to the Ministry of\r\nFinance, the beneficiary of all prior transfers? The central\r\nbank did act as MinFin's agent - but circumstances were\r\nunusual, to say the least.\r\n\r\nThere isn't enough to connect the IMF funds with the\r\nmoney laundering affair that engulfed the Bank of New\r\nYork a year later to the day, in August 1999 - though\r\nseveral of the personalities straddled the divide between\r\nthe bank and its clients. Swiss efforts to establish a firm\r\nlinkage failed as did their attempt to implicate several\r\nbanks in the Italian canton of Ticino. The Swiss - in\r\ncollaboration with half a dozen national investigation\r\nbureaus, including the FBI - were more successful in Italy\r\nproper, where they were able to apprehend a few dozen\r\nsuspects in an elaborate undercover operation.\r\n\r\nFIMACO's name emerged rather early in the swirl of\r\nrumors and denials. At the IMF's behest,\r\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was commissioned by\r\nRussia's central bank to investigate the relationship\r\nbetween the Russian central bank and its Channel Islands\r\noffshoot, Financial Management Company Limited,\r\nimmediately when the accusations surfaced.\r\n\r\nSkuratov unearthed $50 billion in transfers of the nation's\r\nhard currency reserves from the central bank to FIMACO,\r\nwhich was majority-owned by Eurobank, the central\r\nbank's Paris-based daughter company. According to PwC,\r\nEurobank was 23 percent owned by \"Russian companies\r\nand private individuals\".\r\n\r\nDubinin and his successor, Gerashchenko, admit that\r\nFIMACO was used to conceal Russia's assets from its\r\nunrelenting creditors, notably the Geneva-based Mr.\r\n\r\nNessim Gaon, whose companies sued Russia for $600\r\nmillion. Gaon succeeded to freeze Russian accounts in\r\nSwitzerland and Luxemburg in 1993. PwC alerted the\r\nIMF to this pernicious practice, but to no avail.\r\n\r\nMoreover, FIMACO paid exorbitant management fees to\r\nself-liquidating entities, used funds to fuel the speculative\r\nGKO market, disbursed non-reported profits from its\r\nactivities, through \"trust companies\", to Russian subjects,\r\nsuch as schools, hospitals, and charities - and, in general,\r\ntransformed itself into a mammoth slush fund and source\r\nof patronage. Russia admitted to lying to the IMF in 1996.\r\n\r\nIt misstated its reserves by $1 billion.\r\n\r\nSome of the money probably financed the fantastic\r\nsalaries of Dubinin and his senior functionaries. He earned\r\n$240,000 in 1997 - when the average annual salary in\r\nRussia was less than $2000 and when Alan Greenspan,\r\nChairman of the Federal Reserve of the USA, earned\r\nbarely half as much.\r\n\r\nFormer Minister of Finance, Boris Fedorov, asked the\r\ngovernor of the central bank and the prime minister in\r\n1993 to disclose how were the country's foreign exchange\r\nreserves being invested. He was told to mind his own\r\nbusiness. To Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty he said, six\r\nyears later, that various central bank schemes were set up\r\nto \"allow friends to earn handsome profits ... They\r\nallowed friends to make profits because when companies\r\nare created without any risk, and billions of dollars are\r\ntransferred, somebody takes a (quite big) commission ... a\r\nminimum of tens of millions of dollars. The question is:\r\nWho received these commissions? Was this money\r\nrepatriated to the country in the form of dividends?\"\r\nDubinin's vehement denials of FIMACO's involvement in\r\nthe GKO market are disingenuous. Close to half of all\r\nforeign investment in the money-spinning market for\r\nRussian domestic bonds were placed through FIMACO's\r\nnominal parent company, Eurobank and, possibly, through\r\nits subsidiary, co-owned with FIMACO, Eurofinance\r\nBank.\r\n\r\nNor is Dubinin more credible when he denies that profits\r\nand commissions were accrued in FIMACO and then\r\ndrained off. FIMACO's investment management\r\nagreement with Eurobank, signed in 1993, entitled it to\r\n0.06 percent of the managed funds per quarter.\r\n\r\nEven accepting the central banker's ludicrous insistence\r\nthat the balance never exceeded $1.4 billion - FIMACO\r\nwould have earned $3.5 million per annum from\r\nmanagement fees alone - investment profits and brokerage\r\nfees notwithstanding. Even Eurobank's president at the\r\ntime, Andrei Movchan, conceded that FIMACO earned\r\n$1.7 million in management fees.\r\n\r\nThe IMF insisted that the PwC reports exonerated all the\r\nparticipants. It is, therefore, surprising and alarming to\r\nfind that the online copies of these documents, previously\r\nmade available on the IMF's Web site, were \"Removed\r\nSeptember 30, 1999 at the request of\r\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\".\r\n\r\nThe cover of the main report carried a disclaimer that it\r\nwas based on procedures dictated by the central bank and\r\n\"...consequently, we (PwC) make no representation\r\nregarding the sufficiency of the procedures described\r\nbelow ... The report is based solely on financial and other\r\ninformation provided by, and discussions with, the\r\npersons set out in the report. The accuracy and\r\ncompleteness of the information on which the report is\r\nbased is the sole responsibility of those persons. ...\r\n\r\nPricewaterhouseCoopers have not carried out any\r\nverification work which may be construed to represent\r\naudit procedures ... We have not been provided access to\r\nOst West Handelsbank (the recipient of a large part of the\r\n$4.8 IMF tranche)\".\r\n\r\nThe scandal may have hastened the untimely departure of\r\nthe IMF's Managing Director at the time, Michel\r\nCamdessus, though this was never officially\r\nacknowledged. The US Congress was reluctant to\r\naugment the Fund's resources in view of its controversial\r\nhandling of the Asian and Russian crises and contagion.\r\n\r\nThis reluctance persisted well into the new millennium. A\r\ncongressional delegation, headed by James Leach (R,\r\nIowa), Chairman of the Banking and Financial Services\r\nCommittee, visited Russia in April 2000, accompanied by\r\nthe FBI, to investigate the persistent contentions about the\r\nmisappropriation of IMF funds.\r\n\r\nCamdessus himself went out of his way to defend his\r\nrecord and reacted in an unprecedented manner to the\r\nallegations. In a letter to Le Mond, dated August 18, 1999\r\n- and still posted on the IMF's Web site, three years later -\r\nhe wrote, inadvertently admitting to serious\r\nmismanagement:\r\n\"I wish to express my indignation at the false statements,\r\nallegations, and insinuations contained in the articles and\r\neditorial commentary appearing in Le Monde on August\r\n6, 8, and 9 on the content of the PricewaterhouseCoopers\r\n(PWC) audit report relating to the operations of the\r\nCentral Bank of Russia and its subsidiary, FIMACO.\r\n\r\nYour readers will be shocked to learn that the report in\r\nquestion, requested and made public at the initiative of the\r\nIMF ... (concludes that) no misuse of funds has been\r\nproven, and the report does not criticize the IMF's\r\nbehavior ... I would also point out that your representation\r\nof the IMF's knowledge and actions is misleading. We did\r\nknow that part of the reserves of the Central Bank of\r\nRussia was held in foreign subsidiaries, which is not an\r\nillegal practice; however, we did not learn of FIMACO's\r\nactivities until this year--because the audit reports for\r\n1993 and 1994 were not provided to us by the Central\r\nBank of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe IMF, when apprised of the possible range of\r\nFIMACO activities, informed the Russian authorities that\r\nit would not resume lending to Russia until a report on\r\nthese activities was available for review by the IMF and\r\ncorrective actions had been agreed as needed ... I would\r\nadd that what the IMF objected to in FIMACO's\r\noperations extends well beyond the misrepresentation of\r\nRussia's international reserves in mid-1996 and includes\r\nseveral other instances where transactions through it had\r\nresulted in a misleading representation of the reserves and\r\nof monetary and exchange policies. These include loans to\r\nRussian commercial banks and investments in the GKO\r\nmarket\".\r\n\r\nNo one accepted - or accepts - the IMF's convoluted post-\r\nfacto \"clarifications\" at face value. Nor was Dubinin's\r\ntortured sophistry - IMF funds cease to be IMF funds\r\nwhen they are transferred from the Ministry of Finance to\r\nthe central bank - countenanced.\r\n\r\nEven the compromised office of the Russian Prosecutor-\r\nGeneral urged Russian officials, as late as July 2000, to\r\nre-open the investigation regarding the diversion of the\r\nfunds. The IMF dismissed this sudden burst of rectitude as\r\nthe rehashing of old stories. But Western officials -\r\ninterviews by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty - begged\r\nto differ.\r\n\r\nYuri Skuratov, the former Prosecutor-General, ousted for\r\nundue diligence, wrote in a book he published two years\r\nago, that only c. $500 million of the $4.8 were ever used\r\nto stabilize the ruble. Even George Bush Jr., when still a\r\npresidential candidate accused Russia's former Prime\r\nMinister Viktor Chernomyrdin of complicity in\r\nembezzling IMF funds. Chernomyrdin threatened to sue.\r\n\r\nThe rot may run even deeper. The Geneva daily \"Le\r\nTemps\", which has been following the affair relentlessly,\r\naccused, two years ago, Roman Abramovich, a Yeltsin-\r\nera oligarch and a member of the board of directors of\r\nSibneft, of colluding with Runicom, Sibneft's trading arm,\r\nto misappropriate IMF funds. Swiss prosecutors raided\r\nRunicom's offices just one day after Russian Tax Police\r\nraided Sibneft's Moscow headquarters.\r\n\r\nAbsconding with IMF funds seemed to have been a\r\npattern of behavior during Yeltsin's venal regime. The\r\ncolumnist Bradley Cook recounts how Aldrich Ames, the\r\nmole within the CIA, \"was told by his Russian control\r\nofficer during their last meeting, in November 1993, that\r\nthe $130,000 in fresh $100 bills that he was being bribed\r\nwith had come directly from IMF loans.\" Venyamin\r\nSokolov, who headed the Audit Chamber prior to Sergei\r\nStepashin, informed the US Senate of $2 billion that\r\nevaporated from the coffers of the central bank in 1995.\r\n\r\nEven the IMF reluctantly admits:\r\n\"Capital transferred abroad from Russia may represent\r\nsuch legal activities as exports, or illegal sources. But it is\r\nimpossible to determine whether specific capital flows\r\nfrom Russia-legal or illegal-come from a particular\r\ninflow, such as IMF loans or export earnings. To put the\r\nscale of IMF lending to Russia into perspective, Russia's\r\nexports of goods and services averaged about $80 billion a\r\nyear in recent years, which is over 25 times the average\r\nannual disbursement from the IMF since 1992\".\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER\r\nSam Vaknin served in various senior capacities in Mr.\r\n\r\nGaon's firms and advises governments in their\r\nnegotiations with the IMF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. The Enrons of the East\r\n\r\n\r\nHermitage Capital Management, an international\r\ninvestment firm owned by HSBC London, is suing PwC\r\n(PricewaterhouseCoopers), the biggest among the big four\r\naccounting firms (Andersen, the fifth, is being\r\ncannibalized by its competitors).\r\n\r\nHermitage also demands to have PwC's license suspended\r\nin Russia. All this fuss over allegedly shoddy audits of\r\nGazprom, the Russian energy behemoth with over $20\r\nbillion in annual sales and the world's largest reserves of\r\nnatural gas. Hermitage runs a $600 million Russia fund\r\nwhich is invested in the shares of the allegedly misaudited\r\ngiant.\r\n\r\nThe accusations are serious. According to infuriated\r\nHermitage, PwC falsified and distorted the 2000-1 audits\r\nby misrepresenting the sale of Gazprom's subsidiary,\r\nPurgaz, to Itera, a conveniently obscure entity. Other loss\r\nspinning transactions were also creatively tackled.\r\n\r\nStoitransgaz - partly owned by former Gazprom managers\r\nand their relatives - landed more than $1 billion in\r\nlucrative Gazprom contracts.\r\n\r\nThese shenanigans resulted in billions of dollars of losses\r\nand a depressed share price. AFP quotes William\r\nBrowder, Hermitage's disgruntled CEO, as saying: \"This\r\nis Russia's Enron\". PwC threatened to counter-sue\r\nHermitage over its \"completely unfounded\" allegations.\r\n\r\nBut Browder's charges are supported by Boris Fyodorov,\r\na former Russian minister of finance and a current\r\nGazprom independent director. Fyodorov manages his\r\nown investment boutique, United Financial Group.\r\n\r\nBrowder is a former Solomon Brothers investment\r\nbanker. Other investment banks and brokerage firms -\r\nforeign and Russian - are supportive of his allegations.\r\n\r\nThey won't and can't be fobbed.\r\n\r\nFyodorov speculates that PwC turned a blind eye to many\r\nof Gazprom's shadier deals in order to keep the account.\r\n\r\nGazprom shareholders will decide in June whether to\r\nretain it as an auditor or not. Browder is initiating a class\r\naction lawsuit in New York of Gazprom ADR holders\r\nagainst PwC.\r\n\r\nEven Russia's president concurs. A year ago, he muttered\r\nominously about \"enormous amounts of misspent money\r\n(in Gazprom)\". He replaced Rem Vyakhirev, the oligarch\r\nthat ran Gazprom, with his own protégé. Russia owns 38\r\npercent of the company.\r\n\r\nGazprom is just the latest in an inordinately long stream\r\nof companies with dubious methods. Avto VAZ bled itself\r\nwhite - under PwC's nose - shipping cars to dealers,\r\nwithout guarantees or advance payments. The penumbral\r\ndealers then vanished without a trace. Avto VAZ wrote\r\noff more than $1 billion in \"uncollected bills\" by late\r\n1995. PwC did make a mild comment in the 1997 audit.\r\n\r\nBut the first real warning appeared only three years later\r\nin the audit for the year 2000.\r\n\r\nAndrei Sharonov, deputy minister in the federal Ministry\r\nof Economics said, in an interview he granted \"Business\r\nWeek\" last February: \"Auditors have been working on\r\nbehalf of management rather than shareholders.\" In a\r\nseries of outlandish ads, published in Russian business\r\ndailies in late February, senior partners in the PwC\r\nMoscow office made this incredible statement: \"(Audit)\r\ndoes not represent a review of each transaction, or a\r\nqualitative assessment of a company's performance\".\r\n\r\nThe New York Times quotes a former employee of\r\nErnst&Young in Moscow as saying: \"A big client is god.\r\n\r\nYou do what they want and tell you to do. You can play\r\nstraight-laced and try to be upright and protect your\r\nreputation with minor clients, but you can't do it with the\r\nbig guys. If you lose that account, no matter how justified\r\nyou are, that's the end of a career\".\r\n\r\nPwC should know. When it mentioned suspicious heavily\r\ndiscounted sales of oil to Rosneft in a 1998 audit report,\r\nits client, Purneftegaz, replaced it with Arthur Andersen.\r\n\r\nThe dubious deals dutifully vanished from the audit\r\nreports, though they continue apace. Andersen claims\r\nsuch transactions do not require disclosure under Russian\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nHow times change! Throughout the 1990's, Russia and its\r\nnascent private sector were subjected to self-righteous\r\nharangues from visiting Big Five accountants. The\r\nhectoring targeted the lack of good governance among\r\nRussia's corporations and public administration alike.\r\n\r\nHordes of pampered speakers and consultants espoused\r\ntransparent accounting, minority shareholders' rights,\r\nmanagement accessibility and accountability and other\r\nnoble goals.\r\n\r\nThat was before Enron. The tables have turned. The Big\r\nFive - from disintegrating Andersen to KPMG - are being\r\nchastised and fined for negligent practices, flagrant\r\nconflicts of interests, misrepresentation, questionable\r\nethics and worse. Their worldwide clout, moral authority,\r\nand professional standing have been considerably dented.\r\n\r\nAmerica's GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting\r\nPractices) - once considered the undisputable benchmark\r\nof rectitude and disclosure - are now thought in need of\r\nurgent revision. The American issuer of accounting\r\nstandards - FASB (Financial Accounting Standards\r\nBoard) - is widely perceived to be an incestuous\r\narrangement between the clubby members of a rapacious\r\nand unscrupulous profession. Many American scholars\r\neven suggest to adopt the hitherto much-derided\r\nalternative - the International Accounting Standards (IAS)\r\nrecently implemented through much of central and eastern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nRussia's Federal Commission for the Securities Market\r\n(FCSM) convened a conclave of Western and domestic\r\nauditing firms. The theme was how to spot and neutralize\r\nbad auditors. With barely concealed and gleeful\r\nschadenfreude, the Russians said that the Enron scandal\r\nundermined their confidence in Western accountants and\r\nthe GAAP.\r\n\r\nThe Institute of Corporate Law and Corporate Governance\r\n(ICLG), having studied the statements of a few major\r\nRussian firms, concluded that there are indications of\r\nfinancial problems, \"not mentioned by (mostly Western)\r\nauditors\". They may have a point. Most of the banks that\r\ncollapsed ignominiously in 1998 received glowing audits\r\nsigned by Western auditors, often one of the Big Five.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Investor Protection Association (IPA) and\r\nInstitute of Professional Auditors (IPAR) embarked on a\r\nsurvey of Russian investors, enterprises, auditors, and\r\nstate officials - and what they think about the quality of\r\nthe audit services they are getting.\r\n\r\nMany Russian managers - as avaricious and venal as ever\r\n- now can justify hiring malleable and puny local auditors\r\ninstead of big international or domestic ones.\r\n\r\nSurgutneftegaz - with $2 billion net profit last year and\r\non-going dispute with its shareholders about dividends -\r\nwants to sack \"Rosexperitza\", a respectable Russian\r\naccountancy, and hire \"Aval\", a little known accounting\r\noutfit. Aval does not even make it to the list of 200 largest\r\naccounting firms in Russia, according to Renaissance\r\nCapital, an investment bank.\r\n\r\nOther Russian managers are genuinely alarmed by the\r\nvertiginous decline in the reputation of the global\r\naccounting firms and by the inherent conflict of interest\r\nbetween consulting and audit jobs performed by the same\r\nentity. Sviazinvest, a holding and telecom company, hired\r\nAccenture on top of - some say instead of - Andersen\r\nConsulting.\r\n\r\nA decade of achievements in fostering transparency,\r\nbetter corporate governance, and more realistic accounting\r\nin central and eastern Europe - may well evaporate in the\r\nwake of Enron and other scandals. The forces of reaction\r\nand corruption in these nether lands - greedy managers,\r\nvenal bureaucrats, and anti-reformists - all seized the\r\nopportunity to reverse what was hitherto considered an\r\nirreversible trend towards Western standards. This, in\r\nturn, is likely to deter investors and retard the progress\r\ntowards a more efficient market economy.\r\n\r\nThe Big Six accounting firms were among the first to\r\nestablish a presence in Russia. Together with major league\r\nconsultancies, such as Baker-McKinsey, they coached\r\nRussian entrepreneurs and managers in the ways of the\r\nWest. They introduced investors to Russia when it was\r\nstill considered a frontier land. They promoted Russian\r\nenterprises abroad and nursed the first, precarious, joint\r\nventures between paranoid Russians and disdainful\r\nWesterners.\r\n\r\nCompanies like Ernst&Young are at the forefront of the\r\nfight to include independent directors in the boards of\r\nRussian firms, invariably stuffed with relatives and\r\ncronies. Together with IPA, Ernst&Young recently\r\nestablished the National Association of Independent\r\nDirectors (NAID). It is intended to \"assist Russian\r\ncompanies to increase their efficiency through\r\nintroduction of best independent directors' practices\".\r\n\r\nBut even these - often missionary - pioneers were blinded\r\nby the spoils of a \"free for all\", \"winner takes all\", and\r\n\"might is right\" environment. They geared the accounts of\r\ntheir clients - by minimizing their profits - towards tax\r\navoidance and the abolition of dividends. Quoting\r\nunnamed former employees of the audit firms, \"The New\r\nYork Times\" described how \"... the auditors often chose\r\nto play by Russian rules, and in doing so sacrificed the\r\ntransparency that investors were counting on them to\r\nensure\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. The Typology of Financial Scandals\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Overview\r\nThe recent implosion of the global equity markets - from\r\nHong Kong to New York - engendered yet another round\r\nof the semipternal debate: should central banks\r\ncontemplate abrupt adjustments in the prices of assets -\r\nsuch as stocks or real estate - as they do changes in the\r\nconsumer price indices? Are asset bubbles indeed\r\ninflationary and their bursting deflationary?\r\nCentral bankers counter that it is hard to tell a bubble until\r\nit bursts and that market intervention bring about that\r\nwhich it is intended to prevent. There is insufficient\r\nhistorical data, they reprimand errant scholars who insist\r\notherwise. This is disingenuous. Ponzi and pyramid\r\nschemes have been a fixture of Western civilization at\r\nleast since the middle Renaissance.\r\n\r\nAssets tend to accumulate in \"asset stocks\". Residences\r\nbuilt in the 19th century still serve their purpose today.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of new assets created at any given period is,\r\ninevitably, negligible compared to the stock of the same\r\nclass of assets accumulated over decades and, sometimes,\r\ncenturies. This is why the prices of assets are not anchored\r\n- they are only loosely connected to their production costs\r\nor even to their replacement value.\r\n\r\nAsset bubbles are not the exclusive domain of stock\r\nexchanges and shares. \"Real\" assets include land and the\r\nproperty built on it, machinery, and other tangibles.\r\n\"Financial\" assets include anything that stores value and\r\ncan serve as means of exchange - from cash to securities.\r\n\r\nEven tulip bulbs will do.\r\n\r\nIn 1634, in what later came to be known as \"tulipmania\",\r\ntulip bulbs were traded in a special marketplace in\r\nAmsterdam, the scene of a rabid speculative frenzy. Some\r\nrare black tulip bulbs changed hands for the price of a big\r\nmansion house. For four feverish years it seemed like the\r\ncraze would last forever. But the bubble burst in 1637. In\r\na matter of a few days, the price of tulip bulbs was slashed\r\nby 96%!\r\nUniquely, tulipmania was not an organized scam with an\r\nidentifiable group of movers and shakers, which\r\ncontrolled and directed it. Nor has anyone made explicit\r\npromises to investors regarding guaranteed future profits.\r\n\r\nThe hysteria was evenly distributed and fed on itself.\r\n\r\nSubsequent investment fiddles were different, though.\r\n\r\nModern dodges entangle a large number of victims. Their\r\nsize and all-pervasiveness sometimes threaten the national\r\neconomy and the very fabric of society and incur grave\r\npolitical and social costs.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of bubbles.\r\n\r\nAsset bubbles of the first type are run or fanned by\r\nfinancial intermediaries such as banks or brokerage\r\nhouses. They consist of \"pumping\" the price of an asset or\r\nan asset class.\r\n\r\nThe assets concerned can be shares, currencies, other\r\nsecurities and financial instruments - or even savings\r\naccounts. To promise unearthly yields on one's savings is\r\nto artificially inflate the \"price\", or the \"value\" of one's\r\nsavings account.\r\n\r\nMore than one fifth of the population of 1983 Israel were\r\ninvolved in a banking scandal of Albanian proportions. It\r\nwas a classic pyramid scheme. All the banks, bar one,\r\npromised to gullible investors ever increasing returns on\r\nthe banks' own publicly-traded shares.\r\n\r\nThese explicit and incredible promises were included in\r\nprospectuses of the banks' public offerings and won the\r\nimplicit acquiescence and collaboration of successive\r\nIsraeli governments. The banks used deposits, their\r\ncapital, retained earnings and funds illegally borrowed\r\nthrough shady offshore subsidiaries to try to keep their\r\nimpossible and unhealthy promises. Everyone knew what\r\nwas going on and everyone was involved. It lasted 7\r\nyears. The prices of some shares increased by 1-2 percent\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nOn October 6, 1983, the entire banking sector of Israel\r\ncrumbled. Faced with ominously mounting civil unrest,\r\nthe government was forced to compensate shareholders. It\r\noffered them an elaborate share buyback plan over 9\r\nyears. The cost of this plan was pegged at  $6 billion -\r\nalmost 15 percent of Israel's annual GDP. The indirect\r\ndamage remains unknown.\r\n\r\nAvaricious and susceptible investors are lured into\r\ninvestment swindles by the promise of impossibly high\r\nprofits or interest payments.\r\n\r\nThe organizers use the money entrusted to them by new\r\ninvestors to pay off the old ones and thus establish a\r\ncredible reputation. Charles Ponzi perpetrated many such\r\nschemes in 1919-1925 in Boston and later the Florida real\r\nestate market in the USA. Hence a \"Ponzi scheme\".\r\n\r\nIn Macedonia, a savings bank named TAT collapsed in\r\n1997, erasing the economy of an entire major city, Bitola.\r\n\r\nAfter much wrangling and recriminations - many\r\npoliticians seem to have benefited from the scam - the\r\ngovernment, faced with elections in September, has\r\nrecently decided, in defiance of IMF diktats, to offer\r\nmeager compensation to the afflicted savers. TAT was\r\nonly one of a few similar cases. Similar scandals took\r\nplace in Russia and Bulgaria in the 1990's .\r\n\r\nOne third of the impoverished population of Albania was\r\ncast into destitution by the collapse of a series of nation-\r\nwide leveraged investment plans in 1997. Inept political\r\nand financial crisis management led Albania to the verge\r\nof disintegration and a civil war. Rioters invaded police\r\nstations and army barracks and expropriated hundreds of\r\nthousands of weapons.\r\n\r\nIslam forbids its adherents to charge interest on money\r\nlent - as does Judaism. To circumvent this onerous decree,\r\nentrepreneurs and religious figures in Egypt and in\r\nPakistan established \"Islamic banks\". These institutions\r\npay no interest on deposits, nor do they demand interest\r\nfrom borrowers.  Instead, depositors are made partners in\r\nthe banks' - largely fictitious - profits. Clients are charged\r\nfor - no less fictitious - losses. A few Islamic banks were\r\nin the habit of offering vertiginously high \"profits\". They\r\nwent the way of other, less pious, pyramid schemes.\r\n\r\nThey melted down and dragged economies and political\r\nestablishments with them.\r\n\r\nBy definition, pyramid schemes are doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nThe number of new \"investors\" - and the new money they\r\nmake available to the pyramid's organizers - is limited.\r\n\r\nWhen the funds run out and the old investors can no\r\nlonger be paid, panic ensues. In a classic \"run on the\r\nbank\", everyone attempts to draw his money\r\nsimultaneously. Even healthy banks - a distant relative of\r\npyramid schemes - cannot cope with such stampedes.\r\n\r\nSome of the money is invested long-term, or lent. Few\r\nfinancial institutions keep more than 10 percent of their\r\ndeposits in liquid on-call reserves.\r\n\r\nStudies repeatedly demonstrated that investors in pyramid\r\nschemes realize their dubious nature and stand forewarned\r\nby the collapse of other contemporaneous scams. But they\r\nare swayed by recurrent promises that they could draw\r\ntheir money at will (\"liquidity\") and, in the meantime,\r\nreceive alluring returns on it (\"capital gains\", \"interest\r\npayments\", \"profits\").\r\n\r\nPeople know that they are likelier to lose all or part of\r\ntheir money as time passes. But they convince themselves\r\nthat they can outwit the organizers of the pyramid, that\r\ntheir withdrawals of profits or interest payments prior to\r\nthe inevitable collapse will more than amply compensate\r\nthem for the loss of their money. Many believe that they\r\nwill succeed to accurately time the extraction of their\r\noriginal investment based on - mostly useless and\r\nsuperstitious - \"warning signs\".\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the speculative rash lasts, a host of pundits,\r\nanalysts, and scholars aim to justify it. The \"new\r\neconomy\" is exempt from \"old rules and archaic modes of\r\nthinking\". Productivity has surged and established a\r\nsteeper, but sustainable, trend line. Information\r\ntechnology is as revolutionary as electricity. No, more\r\nthan electricity. Stock valuations are reasonable. The Dow\r\nis on its way to 33,000. People want to believe these\r\n\"objective, disinterested analyses\" from \"experts\".\r\n\r\nInvestments by households are only one of the engines of\r\nthis first kind of asset bubbles. A lot of the money that\r\npours into pyramid schemes and stock exchange booms is\r\nlaundered, the fruits of illicit pursuits. The laundering of\r\ntax-evaded money or the proceeds of criminal activities,\r\nmainly drugs, is effected through regular banking\r\nchannels. The money changes ownership a few times to\r\nobscure its trail and the identities of the true owners.\r\n\r\nMany offshore banks manage shady investment ploys.\r\n\r\nThey maintain two sets of books. The \"public\" or\r\n\"cooked\" set is made available to the authorities - the tax\r\nadministration, bank supervision, deposit insurance, law\r\nenforcement agencies, and securities and exchange\r\ncommission. The true record is kept in the second,\r\ninaccessible, set of files.\r\n\r\nThis second set of accounts reflects reality: who deposited\r\nhow much, when and subject to which conditions - and\r\nwho borrowed what, when and subject to what terms.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements are so stealthy and convoluted that\r\nsometimes even the shareholders of the bank lose track of\r\nits activities and misapprehend its real situation.\r\n\r\nUnscrupulous management and staff sometimes take\r\nadvantage of the situation. Embezzlement, abuse of\r\nauthority, mysterious trades, misuse of funds are more\r\nwidespread than acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThe thunderous disintegration of the Bank for Credit and\r\nCommerce International (BCCI) in London in 1991\r\nrevealed that, for the better part of a decade, the\r\nexecutives and employees of this penumbral institution\r\nwere busy stealing and misappropriating $10 billion. The\r\nBank of England's supervision department failed to spot\r\nthe rot on time. Depositors were - partially - compensated\r\nby the main shareholder of the bank, an Arab sheikh. The\r\nstory repeated itself with Nick Leeson and his\r\nunauthorized disastrous trades which brought down the\r\nvenerable and veteran Barings Bank in 1995.\r\n\r\nThe combination of black money, shoddy financial\r\ncontrols, shady bank accounts and shredded documents\r\nrenders a true account of the cash flows and damages in\r\nsuch cases all but impossible. There is no telling what\r\nwere the contributions of drug barons, American off-shore\r\ncorporations, or European and Japanese tax-evaders -\r\nchanneled precisely through such institutions - to the\r\nstratospheric rise in Wall-Street in the last few years.\r\n\r\nBut there is another - potentially the most pernicious -\r\ntype of asset bubble. When financial institutions lend to\r\nthe unworthy but the politically well-connected, to\r\ncronies, and family members of influential politicians -\r\nthey often end up fostering a bubble. South Korean\r\nchaebols, Japanese keiretsu, as well as American\r\nconglomerates frequently used these cheap funds to prop\r\nup their stock or to invest in real estate, driving prices up\r\nin both markets artificially.\r\n\r\nMoreover, despite decades of bitter experiences - from\r\nMexico in 1982 to Asia in 1997 and Russia in 1998 -\r\nfinancial institutions still bow to fads and fashions. They\r\nact herd-like in conformity with \"lending trends\". They\r\nshift assets to garner the highest yields in the shortest\r\npossible period of time. In this respect, they are not very\r\ndifferent from investors in pyramid investment schemes.\r\n\r\nII. Case Study - The Savings and Loans Associations\r\nBailout\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\nAsset bubbles - in the stock exchange, in the real estate or\r\nthe commodity markets - invariably burst and often lead\r\nto banking crises. One such calamity struck the USA in\r\n1986-1989. It is instructive to study the decisive reaction\r\nof the administration and Congress alike. They tackled\r\nboth the ensuing liquidity crunch and the structural flaws\r\nexposed by the crisis with tenacity and skill. Compare this\r\nto the lackluster and hesitant tentativeness of the current\r\nlot. True, the crisis - the result of a speculative bubble -\r\nconcerned the banking and real estate markets rather than\r\nthe capital markets. But the similarities are there.\r\n\r\nThe savings and loans association, or the thrift, was a\r\nstrange banking hybrid, very much akin to the building\r\nsociety in Britain. It was allowed to take in deposits but\r\nwas really merely a mortgage bank. The Depository\r\nInstitutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of\r\n1980 forced S&L's to achieve interest parity with\r\ncommercial banks, thus eliminating the interest ceiling on\r\ndeposits which they enjoyed hitherto.\r\n\r\nBut it still allowed them only very limited entry into\r\ncommercial and consumer lending and trust services.\r\n\r\nThus, these institutions were heavily exposed to the\r\nvicissitudes of the residential real estate markets in their\r\nrespective regions. Every normal cyclical slump in\r\nproperty values or regional economic shock - e.g., a\r\nplunge in commodity prices - affected them\r\ndisproportionately.\r\n\r\nInterest rate volatility created a mismatch between the\r\nassets of these associations and their liabilities. The\r\nnegative spread between their cost of funds and the yield\r\nof their assets - eroded their operating margins. The 1982\r\nGarn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act encouraged\r\nthrifts to convert from mutual - i.e., depositor-owned -\r\nassociations to stock companies, allowing them to tap the\r\ncapital markets in order to enhance their faltering net\r\nworth.\r\n\r\nBut this was too little and too late. The S&L's were\r\nrendered unable to further support the price of real estate\r\nby rolling over old credits, refinancing residential equity,\r\nand underwriting development projects. Endemic\r\ncorruption and mismanagement exacerbated the ruin. The\r\nbubble burst.\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of depositors scrambled to\r\nwithdraw their funds and hundreds of savings and loans\r\nassociation (out of a total of more than 3,000) became\r\ninsolvent instantly, unable to pay their depositors. They\r\nwere besieged by angry - at times, violent - clients who\r\nlost their life savings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe illiquidity spread like fire. As institutions closed their\r\ngates, one by one, they left in their wake major financial\r\nupheavals, wrecked businesses and homeowners, and\r\ndevastated communities. At one point, the contagion\r\nthreatened the stability of the entire banking system.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Savings and Loans Insurance Corporation\r\n(FSLIC) - which insured the deposits in the savings and\r\nloans associations - was no longer able to meet the claims\r\nand, effectively, went bankrupt. Though the obligations of\r\nthe FSLIC were never guaranteed by the Treasury, it was\r\nwidely perceived to be an arm of the federal government.\r\n\r\nThe public was shocked. The crisis acquired a political\r\ndimension.\r\n\r\nA hasty $300 billion bailout package was arranged to\r\ninject liquidity into the shriveling system through a\r\nspecial agency, the FHFB. The supervision of the banks\r\nwas subtracted from the Federal Reserve. The role of the\r\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was\r\ngreatly expanded.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1989, savings and loans were insured by the now-\r\ndefunct FSLIC. The FDIC insured only banks. Congress\r\nhad to eliminate FSLIC and place the insurance of thrifts\r\nunder FDIC. The FDIC kept the Bank Insurance Fund\r\n(BIF) separate from the Savings Associations Insurance\r\nFund (SAIF), to confine the ripple effect of the meltdown.\r\n\r\nThe FDIC is designed to be independent. Its money comes\r\nfrom premiums and earnings of the two insurance funds,\r\nnot from Congressional appropriations. Its board of\r\ndirectors has full authority to run the agency.\r\n\r\nThe board obeys the law, not political masters. The FDIC\r\nhas a preemptive role. It regulates banks and savings and\r\nloans with the aim of avoiding insurance claims by\r\ndepositors.\r\n\r\nWhen an institution becomes unsound, the FDIC can\r\neither shore it up with loans or take it over. If it does the\r\nlatter, it can run it and then sell it as a going concern, or\r\nclose it, pay off the depositors and try to collect the loans.\r\n\r\nAt times, the FDIC ends up owning collateral and trying\r\nto sell it.\r\n\r\nAnother outcome of the scandal was the Resolution Trust\r\nCorporation (RTC). Many savings and loans were treated\r\nas \"special risk\" and placed under the jurisdiction of the\r\nRTC until August 1992. The RTC operated and sold these\r\ninstitutions - or paid off the depositors and closed them. A\r\nnew government corporation (Resolution Fund\r\nCorporation, RefCorp) issued federally guaranteed bailout\r\nbonds whose proceeds were used to finance the RTC until\r\n1996.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) was also\r\nestablished in 1989 to replace the dismantled Federal\r\nHome Loan Board (FHLB) in supervising savings and\r\nloans. OTS is a unit within the Treasury Department, but\r\nlaw and custom make it practically an independent\r\nagency.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) regulates the\r\nsavings establishments for liquidity. It provides lines of\r\ncredit from twelve regional Federal Home Loan Banks\r\n(FHLB). Those banks and the thrifts make up the Federal\r\nHome Loan Bank System (FHLBS). FHFB gets its funds\r\nfrom the System and is independent of supervision by the\r\nexecutive branch.\r\n\r\nThus a clear, streamlined, and powerful regulatory\r\nmechanism was put in place. Banks and savings and loans\r\nabused the confusing overlaps in authority and regulation\r\namong numerous government agencies. Not one regulator\r\npossessed a full and truthful picture. Following the\r\nreforms, it all became clearer: insurance was the FDIC's\r\njob, the OTS provided supervision, and liquidity was\r\nmonitored and imparted by the FHLB.\r\n\r\nHealthy thrifts were coaxed and cajoled to purchase less\r\nsturdy ones. This weakened their balance sheets\r\nconsiderably and the government reneged on its promises\r\nto allow them to amortize the goodwill element of the\r\npurchase over 40 years. Still, there were 2,898 thrifts in\r\n1989. Six years later, their number shrank to 1,612 and it\r\nstands now at less than 1,000. The consolidated\r\ninstitutions are bigger, stronger, and better capitalized.\r\n\r\nLater on, Congress demanded that thrifts obtain a bank\r\ncharter by 1998. This was not too onerous for most of\r\nthem. At the height of the crisis the ratio of their\r\ncombined equity to their combined assets was less than\r\n1%. But in 1994 it reached almost 10% and remained\r\nthere ever since.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable turnaround was the result of serendipity\r\nas much as careful planning. Interest rate spreads became\r\nhighly positive. In a classic arbitrage, savings and loans\r\npaid low interest on deposits and invested the money in\r\nhigh yielding government and corporate bonds. The\r\nprolonged equity bull market allowed thrifts to float new\r\nstock at exorbitant prices.\r\n\r\nAs the juridical relics of the Great Depression - chiefly\r\namongst them, the Glass-Steagall Act - were repealed,\r\nbanks were liberated to enter new markets, offer new\r\nfinancial instruments, and spread throughout the USA.\r\n\r\nProduct and geographical diversification led to enhanced\r\nfinancial health.\r\n\r\nBut the very fact that S&L's were poised to exploit these\r\nopportunities is a tribute to politicians and regulators alike\r\n- though except for setting the general tone of urgency and\r\nresolution, the relative absence of political intervention in\r\nthe handling of the crisis is notable. It was managed by\r\nthe autonomous, able, utterly professional, largely a-\r\npolitical Federal Reserve. The political class provided the\r\nprofessionals with the tools they needed to do the job.\r\n\r\nThis mode of collaboration may well be the most\r\nimportant lesson of this crisis.\r\n\r\nIII. Case Study - Wall Street, October 1929\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\nClaud Cockburn, writing for the \"Times of London\" from\r\nNew-York, described the irrational exuberance that\r\ngripped the nation just prior to the Great Depression.\r\n\r\nAs Europe wallowed in post-war malaise, America\r\nseemed to have discovered a new economy, the secret of\r\nuninterrupted growth and prosperity, the fount of\r\ntransforming technology:\r\n\"The atmosphere of the great boom was savagely exciting,\r\nbut there were times when a person with my European\r\nbackground felt alarmingly lonely. He would have liked to\r\nbelieve, as these people believed, in the eternal upswing\r\nof the big bull market or else to meet just one person with\r\nwhom he might discuss some general doubts without\r\nbeing regarded as an imbecile or a person of deliberately\r\nevil intent-some kind of anarchist, perhaps\".\r\n\r\nThe greatest analysts with the most impeccable credentials\r\nand track records failed to predict the forthcoming crash\r\nand the unprecedented economic depression that followed\r\nit. Irving Fisher, a preeminent economist, who, according\r\nto his biographer-son, Irving Norton Fisher, lost the\r\nequivalent of $140 million in today's money in the crash,\r\nmade a series of soothing predictions. On October 22 he\r\nuttered these avuncular statements: \"Quotations have not\r\ncaught up with real values as yet ... (There is) no cause for\r\na slump ... The market has not been inflated but merely\r\nreadjusted..\".\r\n\r\nEven as the market convulsed on Black Thursday,\r\nOctober 24, 1929 and on Black Tuesday, October 29 - the\r\nNew York Times wrote: \"Rally at close cheers brokers,\r\nbankers optimistic\".\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an editorial on October 26, it blasted rabid speculators\r\nand compliant analysts: ``We shall hear considerably less\r\nin the future of those newly invented conceptions of\r\nfinance which revised the principles of political economy\r\nwith a view solely to fitting the stock market's vagaries.''\r\nBut it ended thus: \"(The Federal Reserve has) insured the\r\nsoundness of the business situation when the speculative\r\nmarkets went on the rocks.''\r\nCompare this to Alan Greenspan Congressional testimony\r\nthis summer: \"While bubbles that burst are scarcely\r\nbenign, the consequences need not be catastrophic for the\r\neconomy ... (The Depression was brought on by) ensuing\r\nfailures of policy\".\r\n\r\nInvestors, their equity leveraged with bank and broker\r\nloans, crowded into stocks of exciting \"new technologies\",\r\nsuch as the radio and mass electrification. The bull market\r\n- especially in issues of public utilities - was fueled by\r\n\"mergers, new groupings, combinations and good\r\nearnings\" and by corporate purchasing for \"employee\r\nstock funds\".\r\n\r\nCautionary voices - such as Paul Warburg, the influential\r\nbanker, Roger Babson, the \"Prophet of Loss\" and\r\nAlexander Noyes, the eternal Cassandra from the New\r\nYork Times - were derided. The number of brokerage\r\naccounts doubled between March 1927 and March 1929.\r\n\r\nWhen the market corrected by 8 percent between March\r\n18-27 - following a Fed induced credit crunch and a series\r\nof mysterious closed-door sessions of the Fed's board -\r\nbankers rushed in. The New York Times reported:\r\n``Responsible bankers agree that stocks should now be\r\nsupported, having reached a level that makes them\r\nattractive.'' By August, the market was up 35 percent on\r\nits March lows. But it reached a peak on September 3 and\r\nit was downhill since then.\r\n\r\nOn October 19, five days before \"Black Thursday\",\r\nBusiness Week published this sanguine prognosis:\r\n\"Now, of course, the crucial weaknesses of such periods --\r\nprice inflation, heavy inventories, over-extension of\r\ncommercial credit -- are totally absent. The security\r\nmarket seems to be suffering only an attack of stock\r\nindigestion... There is additional reassurance in the fact\r\nthat, should business show any further signs of fatigue, the\r\nbanking system is in a good position now to administer\r\nany needed credit tonic from its excellent Reserve\r\nsupply\".\r\n\r\nThe crash unfolded gradually. Black Thursday actually\r\nended with an inspiring rally. Friday and Saturday  -\r\ntrading ceased only on Sundays - witnessed an upswing\r\nfollowed by mild profit taking. The market dropped 12.8\r\npercent on Monday, with Winston Churchill watching\r\nfrom the visitors' gallery - incurring a loss of $10-14\r\nbillion.\r\n\r\nThe Wall Street Journal warned naive investors:\r\n\"Many are looking for technical corrective reactions from\r\ntime to time, but do not expect these to disturb the upward\r\ntrend for any prolonged period.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe market plummeted another 11.7 percent the next day\r\n- though trading ended with an impressive rally from the\r\nlows. October 31 was a good day with a \"vigorous,\r\nbuoyant rally from bell to bell\". Even Rockefeller joined\r\nthe myriad buyers. Shares soared. It seemed that the worst\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times was optimistic:\r\n\"It is thought that stocks will become stabilized at their\r\nactual worth levels, some higher and some lower than the\r\npresent ones, and that the selling prices will be guided in\r\nthe immediate future by the worth of each particular\r\nsecurity, based on its dividend record, earnings ability and\r\nprospects. Little is heard in Wall Street these days about\r\n'putting stocks up.'\"\r\nBut it was not long before irate customers began blaming\r\ntheir stupendous losses on advice they received from their\r\nbrokers. Alec Wilder, a songwriter in New York in 1929,\r\ninterviewed by Stud Terkel in \"Hard Times\" four decades\r\nlater, described this typical exchange with his money\r\nmanager:\r\n\"I knew something was terribly wrong because I heard\r\nbellboys, everybody, talking about the stock market.\r\n\r\nAbout six weeks before the Wall Street Crash, I persuaded\r\nmy mother in Rochester to let me talk to our family\r\nadviser. I wanted to sell stock which had been left me by\r\nmy father. He got very sentimental: 'Oh your father\r\nwouldn't have liked you to do that.' He was so persuasive,\r\nI said O.K. I could have sold it for $160,000. Four years\r\nlater, I sold it for $4,000\".\r\n\r\nExhausted and numb from days of hectic trading and back\r\noffice operations, the brokerage houses pressured the\r\nstock exchange to declare a two day trading holiday.\r\n\r\nExchanges around North America followed suit.\r\n\r\nAt first, the Fed refused to reduce the discount rate.\r\n\"(There) was no change in financial conditions which the\r\nboard thought called for its action.\" - though it did inject\r\nliquidity into the money market by purchasing\r\ngovernment bonds. Then, it partially succumbed and\r\nreduced the New York discount rate, which, curiously,\r\nwas 1 percent above the other Fed districts - by 1 percent.\r\n\r\nThis was too little and too late. The market never\r\nrecovered after November 1. Despite further reductions in\r\nthe discount rate to 4 percent, it shed a whopping 89\r\npercent in nominal terms when it hit bottom three years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nEveryone was duped. The rich were impoverished\r\novernight. Small time margin traders - the forerunners of\r\ntoday's day traders - lost their shirts and much else\r\nbesides. The New York Times:\r\n\"Yesterday's market crash was one which largely affected\r\nrich men, institutions, investment trusts and others who\r\nparticipate in the market on a broad and intelligent scale.\r\n\r\nIt was not the margin traders who were caught in the rush\r\nto sell, but the rich men of the country who are able to\r\nswing blocks of 5,000, 10,000, up to 100,000 shares of\r\nhigh-priced stocks. They went overboard with no more\r\nconsideration than the little trader who was swept out on\r\nthe first day of the market's upheaval, whose prices, even\r\nat their lowest of last Thursday, now look high by\r\ncomparison ...\r\n\r\nTo most of those who have been in the market it is all the\r\nmore awe-inspiring because their financial history is\r\nlimited to bull markets\".\r\n\r\nOverseas - mainly European - selling was an important\r\nfactor. Some conspiracy theorists, such as Webster\r\nTarpley in his \"British Financial Warfare\", supported by\r\ncontemporary reporting by the likes of \"The Economist\",\r\nwent as far as writing:\r\n\"When this Wall Street Bubble had reached gargantuan\r\nproportions in the autumn of 1929, (Lord) Montagu\r\nNorman (governor of the Bank of England 1920-1944)\r\nsharply (upped) the British bank rate, repatriating British\r\nhot money, and pulling the rug out from under the Wall\r\nStreet speculators, thus deliberately and consciously\r\nimploding the US markets. This caused a violent\r\ndepression in the United States and some other countries,\r\nwith the collapse of financial markets and the contraction\r\nof production and employment. In 1929, Norman\r\nengineered a collapse by puncturing the bubble\".\r\n\r\nThe crash was, in large part, a reaction to a sharp reversal,\r\nstarting in 1928, of the reflationary, \"cheap money\",\r\npolicies of the Fed intended, as Adolph Miller of the Fed's\r\nBoard of Governors told a Senate committee, \"to bring\r\ndown money rates, the call rate among them, because of\r\nthe international importance the call rate had come to\r\nacquire. The purpose was to start an outflow of gold - to\r\nreverse the previous inflow of gold into this country (back\r\nto Britain).\" But the Fed had already lost control of the\r\nspeculative rush.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crash of 1929 was not without its Enrons and\r\nWorld.com's. Clarence Hatry and his associates admitted\r\nto forging the accounts of their investment group to show\r\na fake net worth of $24 million British pounds - rather\r\nthan the true picture of 19 billion in liabilities. This led to\r\nforced liquidation of Wall Street positions by harried\r\nBritish financiers.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Middle West Utilities, run by the energy\r\ntycoon, Samuel Insull, exposed a web of offshore holding\r\ncompanies whose only purpose was to hide losses and\r\ndisguise leverage. The former president of NYSE, Richard\r\nWhitney was arrested for larceny.\r\n\r\nAnalysts and commentators thought of the stock exchange\r\nas decoupled from the real economy. Only one tenth of\r\nthe population was invested - compared to 40 percent\r\ntoday. \"The World\" wrote, with more than a bit of\r\nSchadenfreude: \"The country has not suffered a\r\ncatastrophe ... The American people ... has been gambling\r\nlargely with the surplus of its astonishing prosperity.\"\r\n\"The Daily News\" concurred: \"The sagging of the stocks\r\nhas not destroyed a single factory, wiped out a single farm\r\nor city lot or real estate development, decreased the\r\nproductive powers of a single workman or machine in the\r\nUnited States.\" In Louisville, the \"Herald Post\"\r\ncommented sagely: \"While Wall Street was getting rid of\r\nits weak holder to their own most drastic punishment,\r\ngrain was stronger. That will go to the credit side of the\r\nnational prosperity and help replace that buying power\r\nwhich some fear has been gravely impaired\".\r\n\r\nDuring the Coolidge presidency, according to the\r\nEncyclopedia Britannica, \"stock dividends rose by 108\r\npercent, corporate profits by 76 percent, and wages by 33\r\npercent. In 1929, 4,455,100 passenger cars were sold by\r\nAmerican factories, one for every 27 members of the\r\npopulation, a record that was not broken until 1950.\r\n\r\nProductivity was the key to America's economic growth.\r\n\r\nBecause of improvements in technology, overall labour\r\ncosts declined by nearly 10 percent, even though the\r\nwages of individual workers rose\".\r\n\r\nJude Waninski adds in his tome \"The Way the World\r\nWorks\" that \"between 1921 and 1929, GNP grew to\r\n$103.1 billion from $69.6 billion. And because prices\r\nwere falling, real output increased even faster.\" Tax rates\r\nwere sharply reduced.\r\n\r\nJohn Kenneth Galbraith noted these data in his seminal\r\n\"The Great Crash\":\r\n\"Between 1925 and 1929, the number of manufacturing\r\nestablishments increased from 183,900 to 206,700; the\r\nvalue of their output rose from $60.8 billions to $68\r\nbillions. The Federal Reserve index of industrial\r\nproduction which had averaged only 67 in 1921 ... had\r\nrisen to 110 by July 1928, and it reached 126 in June 1929\r\n... (but the American people) were also displaying an\r\ninordinate desire to get rich quickly with a minimum of\r\nphysical effort\".\r\n\r\nPersonal borrowing for consumption peaked in 1928 -\r\nthough the administration, unlike today, maintained twin\r\nfiscal and current account surpluses and the USA was a\r\nlarge net creditor.\r\n\r\nCharles Kettering, head of the research division of\r\nGeneral Motors described consumeritis thus, just days\r\nbefore the crash: \"The key to economic prosperity is the\r\norganized creation of dissatisfaction\".\r\n\r\nInequality skyrocketed. While output per man-hour shot\r\nup by 32 percent between 1923 and 1929, wages crept up\r\nonly 8 percent. In 1929, the top 0.1 percent of the\r\npopulation earned as much as the bottom 42 percent.\r\n\r\nBusiness-friendly administrations reduced by 70 percent\r\nthe exorbitant taxes paid by those with an income of more\r\nthan $1 million. But in the summer of 1929, businesses\r\nreported sharp increases in inventories. It was the\r\nbeginning of the end.\r\n\r\nWere stocks overvalued prior to the crash? Did all stocks\r\ncollapse indiscriminately? Not so. Even at the height of\r\nthe panic, investors remained conscious of real values. On\r\nNovember 3, 1929 the shares of American Can, General\r\nElectric, Westinghouse and Anaconda Copper were still\r\nsubstantially higher than on March 3, 1928.\r\n\r\nJohn Campbell and Robert Shiller, author of \"Irrational\r\nExuberance\", calculated, in a joint paper titled \"Valuation\r\nRatios and the Lon-Run Market Outlook: An Update\"\r\nposted on Yale University' s Web Site, that share prices\r\ndivided by a moving average of 10 years worth of\r\nearnings reached 28 just prior to the crash. Contrast this\r\nwith 45 on March 2000.\r\n\r\nIn an NBER working paper published December 2001 and\r\ntellingly titled \"The Stock Market Crash of 1929 - Irving\r\nFisher was Right\", Ellen McGrattan and Edward Prescott\r\nboldly claim:\r\n\r\n\"We find that the stock market in 1929 did not crash\r\nbecause the market was overvalued. In fact, the evidence\r\nstrongly suggests that stocks were undervalued, even at\r\ntheir 1929 peak\".\r\n\r\nAccording to their detailed paper, stocks were trading at\r\n19 times after-tax corporate earning at the peak in 1929, a\r\nfraction of today's valuations even after the recent\r\ncorrection. A March 1999 \"Economic Letter\" published\r\nby the Federal Reserve Bank of San-Francisco\r\nwholeheartedly concurs. It notes that at the peak, prices\r\nstood at 30.5 times the dividend yield, only slightly above\r\nthe long term average.\r\n\r\nContrast this with an article published in June 1990 issue\r\nof the \"Journal of Economic History\" by Robert Barsky\r\nand Bradford De Long and titled \"Bull and Bear Markets\r\nin the Twentieth Century\":\r\n\"Major bull and bear markets were driven by shifts in\r\nassessments of fundamentals: investors had little\r\nknowledge of crucial factors, in particular the long run\r\ndividend growth rate, and their changing expectations of\r\naverage dividend growth plausibly lie behind the major\r\nswings of this century\".\r\n\r\nJude Waninski attributes the crash to the disintegration of\r\nthe pro-free-trade coalition in the Senate which later led to\r\nthe notorious Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. He traces\r\nall the important moves in the market between March\r\n1929 and June 1930 to the intricate protectionist danse\r\nmacabre in Congress.\r\n\r\nThis argument may never be decided. Is a similar crash on\r\nthe cards? This cannot be ruled out.\r\n\r\nThe 1990's resembled the 1920's in more than one way.\r\n\r\nAre we ready for a recurrence of 1929? About as we were\r\nprepared in 1928. Human nature - the prime mover behind\r\nmarket meltdowns - seemed not to have changed that\r\nmuch in these intervening seven decades.\r\n\r\nWill a stock market crash, should it happen, be followed\r\nby another \"Great Depression\"? It depends which kind of\r\ncrash. The short term puncturing of a temporary bubble -\r\ne.g., in 1962 and 1987 - is usually divorced from other\r\neconomic fundamentals. But a major correction to a\r\nlasting bull market invariably leads to recession or worse.\r\n\r\nAs the economist Hernan Cortes Douglas reminds us in\r\n\"The Collapse of Wall Street and the Lessons of History\"\r\npublished by the Friedberg Mercantile Group, this was the\r\nsequence in London in 1720 (the infamous \"South Sea\r\nBubble\"), and in the USA in 1835-40 and 1929-32.\r\n\r\nIV. Britain's Real Estate\r\nThe five ghastly \"Jack the Ripper\" murders took place in\r\nan area less than a quarter square mile in size. Houses in\r\nthis haunting and decrepit no man's land straddling the\r\nCity and metropolitan London could be had for 25-50,000\r\nBritish pounds as late as a decade ago. How things\r\nchange!\r\nThe general buoyancy in real estate prices in the capital\r\ncoupled with the adjacent Spitalfields urban renewal\r\nproject have lifted prices. A house not 50 yards from the\r\nscene of the Ripper's last - and most ghoulish - slaying\r\nnow sells for over 1 million pounds. In central London,\r\none bedroom apartments retail for an outlandish half a\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\nAccording to research published in September 2002 by\r\nHalifax, the UK's largest mortgage lender, the number of\r\n1 million pound homes sold has doubled in 1999-2002 to\r\n2600. By 2002, it has increased elevenfold since 1995.\r\n\r\nAccording to The Economist's house price index, prices\r\nrose by a further 15.6% in 2003, 10.2% in 2004 and a\r\nwhopping 147% in total since 1997. In Greater London,\r\none in every 90 homes fetches even a higher price. The\r\naverage UK house now costs 100,000 pounds. In the\r\nUSA, the ratios of house prices to rents and to median\r\nincome are at historic highs.\r\n\r\nOne is reminded of the Japanese boast, at the height of\r\ntheir realty bubble, that the grounds of the royal palace in\r\nTokyo are worth more than the entire real estate of\r\nManhattan. Is Britain headed the same way?\r\nA house - much like a Big Mac - is a basket of raw\r\nmaterials, goods, and services. But, unlike the Big Mac -\r\nand the purchasing power index it spawned - houses are\r\nalso investment vehicles and stores of value. They yield\r\noften tax exempt capital gains, rental income, or benefits\r\nfrom occupying them (rent payments saved). Real estate is\r\nused to hedge against inflation, save for old age, and\r\nspeculate. Prices of residential and commercial property\r\nreflect scarcity, investment fads, and changing moods.\r\n\r\nHomeowners in both the UK and the USA - spurred on by\r\naggressive marketing and the lowest interest rates in 30\r\nyears - have been refinancing old, more expensive,\r\nmortgages and heavily borrowing against their \"equity\" -\r\ni.e., against the meteoric rise in the market prices of their\r\nabodes.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Milken Institute in Los Angeles, asset\r\nbubbles tend to both enhance and cannibalize each other.\r\n\r\nProfits from surging tradable securities are used to buy\r\nproperty and drive up its values. Borrowing against\r\nresidential equity fuels overvaluations in fervid stock\r\nexchanges. When one bubble bursts - the other initially\r\nbenefits from an influx of funds withdrawn in panic from\r\nthe shriveling alternative.\r\n\r\nQuantitatively, a considerably larger share of the nation's\r\nwealth is tied in real estate than in the capital markets.\r\n\r\nYet, the infamous wealth effect - an alleged fluctuation in\r\nthe will to consume as a result of changing fortunes in the\r\nstock exchange - is equally inconspicuous in the realty\r\nmarkets. It seems that consumption is correlated with\r\nlifelong projected earnings rather than with the state of\r\none's savings and investments.\r\n\r\nThis is not the only counter-intuitive finding. Asset\r\ninflation - no matter how vertiginous - rarely spills into\r\nconsumer prices. The recent bubbles in Japan and the\r\nUSA, for instance, coincided with a protracted period of\r\ndisinflation. The bursting of bubbles does have a\r\ndeflationary effect, though.\r\n\r\nIn a late 2002 survey of global house price movements,\r\n\"The Economist\" concluded that real estate inflation is a\r\nglobal phenomenon. Though Britain far outpaces the\r\nUnited States and Italy (65% rise since 1997), it falls\r\nbehind Ireland (179%) and South Africa (195%). It is in\r\nleague with Australia (with 113%) and Spain (132%).\r\n\r\nThe paper notes wryly:\r\n\"Just as with equities in the late 1990s, property bulls\r\nare now coming up with bogus arguments for why\r\nrampant house-price inflation is sure to continue.\r\n\r\nDemographic change ... Physical restrictions and tough\r\nplanning laws ... Similar arguments were heard in\r\nJapan in the late 1980s and Germany in the early 1990s\r\n- and yet in recent years house prices in these two\r\ncountries have been falling. British house prices also\r\ntumbled in the late 1980s\".\r\n\r\nThey are bound to do so again. In the long run, the rise in\r\nhouse prices cannot exceed the increase in disposable\r\nincome. The effects of the bursting of a property bubble\r\nare invariably more pernicious and prolonged than the\r\noutcomes of a bear market in stocks. Real estate is much\r\nmore leveraged. Debt levels can well exceed home equity\r\n(\"negative equity\") in a downturn. Nowadays, loans are\r\nnot eroded by high inflation. Adjustable rate mortgages -\r\none third of the annual total in the USA - will make sure\r\nthat the burden of real indebtedness mushrooms as interest\r\nrates rise.\r\n\r\nThe Economist (April 2005):\r\n\"An IMF study on asset bubbles estimates that 40% of\r\nhousing booms are followed by housing busts, which last\r\nfor an average of four years and see an average decline\r\nof roughly 30% in home values. But given how many\r\nhomebuyers in booming markets seem to be basing their\r\npurchasing decisions on expectations of outsized\r\nreturns-a recent survey of buyers in Los Angeles\r\nindicated that they expected their homes to increase in\r\nvalue by a whopping 22% a year over the next decade-\r\nnasty downturns in at least some markets seem likely\".\r\n\r\nWith both the equity and realty markets in gloom, people\r\nrevert to cash and bonds and save more - leading to\r\ndeflation or recession or both. Japan is a prime example of\r\nsuch a shift of investment preferences. When prices\r\ncollapse sufficiently to become attractive, investors pile\r\nback into both the capital and real estate markets. This\r\ncycle is as old and as inevitable as human greed and fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. The Shadowy World of International Finance\r\n\r\n\r\nStrange, penumbral, characters roam the boardrooms of\r\nbanks in the countries in transition. Some of them pop\r\napparently from nowhere, others are very well connected\r\nand equipped with the most excellent introductions. They\r\nall peddle financial transactions which are too good to be\r\ntrue and often are. In the unctuously perfumed propinquity\r\nof their Mercedesed, Rolex waving entourage - the\r\npolydipsic natives dissolve in their irresistible charm and\r\nthe temptations of the cash: mountainous returns on\r\ncapital, effulgent profits, no collaterals, track record, or\r\nbusiness plan required. Total security is cloyingly assured.\r\n\r\nThese Fausts roughly belong to four tribes:\r\nThe Shoppers\r\nThese are the shabby operators of the marginal shadows\r\nof the world of finance. They broker financial deals with\r\nmeretricious sweat only to be rewarded their meagre,\r\nhumiliated fees. Most of their deals do not materialize.\r\n\r\nThe principle is very simple:\r\nThey approach a bank, a financial institution, or a\r\nborrower and say: \"We are connected to banks or\r\nfinancial institutions in the West. We can bring you\r\nmoney in the form of credits. But to do that - you must\r\nfirst express interest in getting this money. You must\r\nfurnish us with a bank guarantee / promissory note / letter\r\nof intent that indicates that you desire the credit and that\r\nyou are willing to provide a liquid financial instrument to\r\nback it up.\". Having obtained such instruments, the\r\nshoppers begin to \"shop around\". They approach banks\r\nand financial institutions (usually, in the West). This time,\r\nthey reverse their text: \"We have an excellent client, a\r\ngood borrower. Are you willing to lend to it?\" An\r\ninformal process of tendering ensues. Sometimes it ends\r\nin a transaction and the shopper collects a small\r\ncommission (between one quarter of a percentage point\r\nand two percentage points - depending on the amount).\r\n\r\nMostly it doesn't -and the Flying Dutchman resumes his\r\nwanderings looking for more venal gulosity and less legal\r\nprobity.\r\n\r\nThe Con-Men\r\nThese are crooks who set up elaborate schemes (\"sting\r\noperations\") to extract money from unsuspecting people\r\nand financial institutions. They establish \"front\" or\r\n\"phantom\" firms and offices throughout the world. They\r\ntempt the gullible by offering them enormous, immediate,\r\ntax-free, effort-free, profits. They let the victims profit in\r\nthe first round or two of the scam. Then, they sting: the\r\nvictims invest money and it evaporates together with the\r\ndishonest operators. The \"offices\" are deserted, the fake\r\nidentities, the forged bank references, the falsified\r\nguarantees are all exposed (often with the help of an\r\ninside informant).\r\n\r\nProbably the most famous and enduring scam is the\r\n\"Nigerian-type Connection\". Letters - allegedly composed\r\nby very influential and highly placed officials - are sent\r\nout to unsuspecting businessmen. The latter are asked to\r\nmake their bank accounts available to the former, who\r\nprofess to need the third party bank accounts through\r\nwhich to funnel the sweet fruits of corruption. The\r\naccount owners are promised huge financial rewards if\r\nthey collaborate and if they bear some minor-by-\r\ncomparison upfront costs. The con-men pocket these\r\n\"expenses\" and vanish. Sometimes, they even empty the\r\naccounts of their entire balance as they evaporate.\r\n\r\nThe Launderers\r\nA lot of cash goes undeclared to tax authorities in\r\ncountries in transition. The informal economy (the\r\ndaughter of both criminal and legitimate parents)\r\ncomprises between 15% (Slovenia) and 50% (Russia,\r\nMacedonia) of the official one. Some say these figures are\r\na deliberate and ferocious understatement. These are mind\r\nboggling amounts, which circulate between financial\r\ncentres and off shore havens in the world: Cyprus, the\r\nCayman Islands, Liechtenstein (Vaduz), Panama and\r\ndozens of aspiring laundrettes.\r\n\r\nThe money thus smuggled is kept in low-yielding cash\r\ndeposits. To escape the cruel fate of inflationary\r\ncorrosion, it has to be reinvested. It is stealthily re-\r\nintroduced to the very economy that it so sought to evade,\r\nin the form of investment capital or other financial assets\r\n(loans and credits). Its anxious owners are preoccupied\r\nwith legitimising their stillborn cash through the conduit\r\nof tax-fearing enterprises, or with lending it to same. The\r\nemphasis is on the word: \"legitimate\". The money surges\r\nin through mysterious and anonymous foreign\r\ncorporations, via off-shore banking centres, even through\r\nrespectable financial institutions (the Bank of New York\r\nwe mentioned?). It is easy to recognize a laundering\r\noperation. Its hallmark is a pronounced lack of selectivity.\r\n\r\nThe money is invested in anything and everything, as long\r\nas it appears legitimate. Diversification is not sought by\r\nthese nouveau tycoons and they have no core investment\r\nstrategy. They spread their illicit funds among dozens of\r\ndisparate economic activities and show not the slightest\r\ninterest in the putative yields on their investments, the\r\nmaturity of their assets, the quality of their newly acquired\r\nbusinesses, their history, or real value. Never the\r\nsedulous, they pay exorbitantly for all manner of\r\nprestidigital endeavours. The future prospects and other\r\nnormal investment criteria are beyond them. All they are\r\nafter is a mirage of lapidarity.\r\n\r\nThe Investors\r\nThis is the most intriguing group. Normative, law abiding,\r\nbusinessmen, who stumbled across methods to secure\r\nexcessive yields on their capital and are looking to borrow\r\ntheir way into increasing it. By cleverly participating in\r\nbond tenders, by devising ingenious option strategies, or\r\nby arbitraging - yields of up to 300% can be collected in\r\nthe immature markets of transition without the normally\r\nassociated risks. This sub-species can be found mainly in\r\nRussia and in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nIts members often buy sovereign bonds and notes at\r\ndiscounts of up to 80% of their face value. Russian\r\nobligations could be had for less in August 1998 and\r\nMacedonian ones during the Kosovo crisis. In cahoots\r\nwith the issuing country's central bank, they then convert\r\nthe obligations to local currency at par (for 100% of their\r\nface value). The difference makes, needless to add, for an\r\nimmediate and hefty profit, yet it is in (often worthless\r\nand vicissitudinal) local currency. The latter is then\r\nhurriedly disposed of (at a discount) and sold to\r\nmultinationals with operations in the country of issue,\r\nwhich are in need of local tender. This fast becomes an\r\nalmost addictive avocation.\r\n\r\nIntoxicated by this pecuniary nectar, the fortunate, those\r\nprivy to the secret, try to raise more capital by hunting for\r\nfinancial instruments they can convert to cash in Western\r\nbanks. A bank guarantee, a promissory note, a confirmed\r\nletter of credit, a note or a bond guaranteed by the Central\r\nBank - all will do as deposited collateral against which a\r\ncredit line is established and cash is drawn. The cash is\r\nthen invested in a new cycle of inebriation to yield\r\nfantastic profits.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to identify these \"investors\". They eagerly seek\r\nfinancial instruments from almost any local bank, no\r\nmatter how suspect. They offer to pay for these coveted\r\ndocuments (bank guarantees, bankers' acceptances, letters\r\nof credit) either in cash or by lending to the bank's clients\r\nand this within a month or more from the date of their\r\nissuance. They agree to \"cancel\" the locally issued\r\nfinancial instruments by offering a \"counter-financial-\r\ninstrument\" (safe keeping receipt, contra-guarantee,\r\ncounter promissory note, etc.). This \"counter-instrument\"\r\nis issued by the very Prime World or European Bank in\r\nwhich the locally issued financial instruments are\r\ndeposited as collateral.\r\n\r\nThe Investors invariably confidently claim that the\r\nfinancial instrument issued by the local bank will never be\r\npresented or used (which is true) and that this is a risk free\r\ntransaction (which is not entirely so). If they are forced to\r\nlend to the bank's clients, they often ignore the quality of\r\nthe credit takers, the yields, the maturities and other\r\nconsiderations which normally tend to interest lenders\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\nWhether a financial instrument cancelled by another is\r\nstill valid, presentable and should be honoured by its\r\nissuer is still debated. In some cases it is clearly so. If\r\nsomething goes horribly (and rarely, admittedly) wrong\r\nwith these transactions - the local bank stands to suffer,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nIt all boils down to a terrible hunger, the kind of thirst that\r\ncan be quelled only by the denominated liquidity of lucre.\r\n\r\nIn the post nuclear landscape of this part of the world, a\r\nfantasy is shared by both predators and prey. Circling\r\neach other in marble temples, they switch their roles in\r\ndizzying progression. Tycoons and politicians,\r\nindustrialists and bureaucrats all vie for the attention of\r\nMammon. The shifting coalitions of well groomed man in\r\nback stabbed suits, an hallucinatory carousel of avarice\r\nand guile. But every circus folds and every Luna park is\r\ndestined to shut down. The dying music, the frozen\r\naccounts of the deceived, the bankrupt banks, the Jurassic\r\nPark of skeletal industrial beasts - a muted testimony to a\r\nwild age of mutual assured destruction and self deceit.\r\n\r\nThe future of Eastern and South Europe. The present of\r\nRussia, Albania and Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. Treasure Island Revisited On Maritime Piracy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rumors concerning the demise of maritime piracy\r\nback in the 19th century were a tad premature. The\r\nscourge has so resurged that the International Maritime\r\nBoard (IMB), founded by the International Chamber of\r\nCommerce (ICC) in 1981, is forced to broadcast daily\r\npiracy reports to all shipping companies by satellite from\r\nits Kuala Lumpur Piracy Reporting Center, established in\r\n1992 and partly funded by maritime insurers. The reports\r\ncarry this alarming disclaimer:\r\n\"For statistical purposes, the IMB defines piracy and\r\narmed robbery as: An act of boarding or attempting to\r\nboard any ship with the apparent intent to commit theft or\r\nany other crime and with the apparent intent or capability\r\nto use force in the furtherance of that act. This definition\r\nthus covers actual or attempted attacks whether the ship is\r\nberthed, at anchor or at sea. Petty thefts are excluded,\r\nunless the thieves are armed\".\r\n\r\nThe 1994 United Nations Convention on the Law of the\r\nSea defines piracy as \"any illegal acts of violence or\r\ndetention, or any act of depredation, committed by\r\nindividuals (borne aboard a pirate vessel) for private ends\r\nagainst a private ship or aircraft (the victim vessel)\".\r\n\r\nWhen no \"pirate vessel\" is involved - for instance, when\r\ncriminals embark on a ship and capture it - the legal term\r\nis hijacking.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 2002 seven pirates, armed with long knives\r\nattacked an officer of a cargo ship berthed in Chittagong\r\nport in Bangladesh, snatched his gold chain and watch and\r\ndislocated his arm. This was the third such attack since the\r\nship dropped anchor in this minacious port.\r\n\r\nThree days earlier, in Indonesia, similarly-armed pirates\r\nescaped with the crew's valuables, having tied the hands\r\nof the duty officer. Pirates in small boats stole anodes\r\nfrom the stern of a bulk carrier in Bangladesh. Others, in\r\nIndonesia, absconded with a life raft.\r\n\r\nThe pirates of Guyana are either unlucky or untrained.\r\n\r\nThey were consistently scared off by flares hurled at them\r\nand alarms set by vigilant hands on deck. A Colombian\r\nband, riding a high speed boat, attempted to board a\r\ncontainer ship. Warring parties in Somalia hijacked yet\r\nanother ship in June 2002.\r\n\r\nA particularly egregious case - and signs of growing\r\nsophistication and coordinated action - is described in the\r\nJuly 1-8, 2002 report of the IMB:\r\n\"Six armed pirates boarded a chemical tanker from a\r\nsmall boat and stole ship's stores. Another group of pirates\r\nbroke in to engine room and stole spare parts. Thefts took\r\nplace in spite of the ship engaging three shore security\r\nwatchmen.\" Piracy incidents have been reported in India,\r\nMalaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, the Red Sea,\r\nthe Gulf of Aden, Nigeria, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican\r\nRepublic, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela.\r\n\r\nAccording to the ICC Year 2001 Piracy Report, more than\r\n330 attacks on seafaring vessels were reported in 2001 -\r\ndown by a quarter compared to 2000 but 10 percent\r\nhigher than 1999 and four times the 1991 figure. Piracy\r\nrose 40 percent between 1998 and 1999 alone.\r\n\r\nSixteen ships - double the number in 2000 - were captured\r\nand taken over in 2001. Eighty seven attacks were\r\nreported during the first quarter of 2002 - up from 68 in\r\nthe corresponding period the year before. Seven of these\r\nwere hijackings - compared to only 1 in the first quarter of\r\n2001. Nine of every 10 hijacked ships are ultimately\r\nrecovered, often with the help of the IMB.\r\n\r\nMany masters and shipowners do not report piracy for\r\nfear of delays due to protracted investigations, increased\r\ninsurance premiums, bad publicity, and stifling red tape.\r\n\r\nThe number of unreported attacks in 1999 was estimated\r\nby the World Maritime Piracy Report to be 130.\r\n\r\nAccording to \"The Economist\", the IMO believes that half\r\nof all incidents remain untold. Still, increased patrols and\r\ninternational collaboration among law enforcement\r\nagencies dented the clear upward trend in maritime crime\r\n- even in the piracy capital, Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThe number of incidents in the pirate-infested Malacca\r\nStraits dropped from 75 in 2000 to 17 in 2001 - though the\r\nnumber of crew \"kidnap and ransom\" operations,\r\nespecially in Aceh, has increased. Owners usually pay the\r\n\"reasonable\" amounts demanded - c. $100,000 per ship.\r\n\r\nContrary to folklore, most ships are attacked while at\r\nanchor.\r\n\r\nTwenty one people, including passengers, were killed in\r\n2001 - and 210 taken hostage. Assaults involving guns\r\nwere up 50 percent to 73 - those involving mere knives\r\ndown by a quarter to 105. Piracy seems to ebb and flow\r\nwith the business cycles of the host economies. The Asian\r\ncrisis, triggered by the freefall of the Thai baht in 1997-8,\r\ngave a boost to East Asian maritime robbers. So did the\r\ndebt crises of Latin America a decade earlier. Drug\r\ntransporters - armed with light aircraft and high speed\r\nmotorboats - sometimes double as pirates during the dry\r\nseason of crop growth.\r\n\r\nPirates endanger ship and crew. But they often cause\r\ncollateral damage as well. Pirates have been known to\r\ndump noxious cargo into the sea, or tie up the crew and let\r\nan oil tanker steam ahead, its navigational aides smashed,\r\nor tamper with substances dangerous to themselves and to\r\nothers, or cast crew and passengers adrift in tiny rafts with\r\nlittle food and water.\r\n\r\nMany shipowners resorted to installing on-board satellite\r\ntracking systems, such as Shiploc, and aircraft-like \"black\r\nboxes\". A bulletproof life vest, replete with an integral\r\njagged edged knife, was on display in the millennium\r\nexhibition at the Millennium Dome two years ago. The\r\nInternational Maritime Organization (IMO) is considering\r\nto compel shipowners to tag their vessels with visibly\r\nembossed numbers in compliance with the Safety of Life\r\nat Sea Convention.\r\n\r\nThe IMB also advises shipping companies to closely\r\nexamine the papers of crew and masters, thousands of\r\nwhom carry forged documents. In  54 maritime\r\nadministrations surveyed in 2001 by the Seafarers'\r\nInternational Research Centre, Cardiff University in\r\nWales, more than 12,000 cases of forged certificates of\r\ncompetency were unearthed.\r\n\r\nMany issuing authorities are either careless or venal or\r\nboth. The IMB accused the Coast Guard Office of Puerto\r\nRico for issuing 500 such \"suspicious\" certificates. The\r\nChinese customs and navy - especially along the southern\r\ncoast - have often been decried for working hand in glove\r\nwith pirates.\r\n\r\nFalse documents are an integral - and crucial - part of\r\nmaritime piracy. The IMB says:\r\n\"Many of the phantom ships that set off to sea with a\r\ncargo and then disappear are sailed by crewmen with false\r\npassports and competency certificates. They usually\r\nescape detection by the port authorities. In a recent case of\r\na vessel located and arrested in South-East Asia further to\r\nIMB investigations, it has emerged that all the senior\r\nofficers had false passports. The ship's registry documents\r\nwere also false\".\r\n\r\nAs documents go electronic and integrated in proprietary\r\nor common cargo tracking systems, such forgery will\r\nwane. Bolero - an international digital bill of lading ledger\r\n- is backed by the European Union, banks, shipping and\r\ninsurance companies. The IMO is a proponent of a\r\ntechnology to apply encrypted \"digital signatures\" to\r\nelectronic bills of lading. Still, the industry is highly\r\nfragmented and many ships and ports don't even possess\r\nrudimentary information technology. The protection\r\nafforded by the likes of Bolero is at least five years away.\r\n\r\nPirates sometimes work hand in hand with conspiring\r\ncrew members (or, less often, stowaways). In many\r\ncountries - in East Asia, Latin America, and Africa -\r\nCoast Guard operatives, corrupt drug agents, and other\r\nlaw enforcement officials, moonlight as pirates. Renegade\r\nmembers of British trained Indonesian anti-piracy squads\r\nare still roaming the Malacca Straits.\r\n\r\nPirates also enjoy the support of an insidious and vast\r\nnetwork of suborned judges and bureaucrats. Local\r\nvillagers along the coasts of Indonesia and Malaysia - and\r\nAfrica - welcome pirate business and provide the\r\nperpetrators with food and shelter.\r\n\r\nMoreover, large tankers, container ships, and cargo\r\nvessels are largely computerized and their crew members\r\nfew. The value of an average vessel's freight has increased\r\ndramatically with improvements in container and oil\r\nstorage technologies. \"Flag of convenience\" registration\r\nhas assumed monstrous proportions, allowing ship owners\r\nand managers to conceal their identity effectively. Belize,\r\nHonduras, and Panama are the most notorious, no\r\nquestions asked, havens.\r\n\r\nPiracy has matured into a branch of organized crime.\r\n\r\nHijacking requires money, equipment, weapons, planning,\r\nexperience and contacts with corrupt officials. The loot\r\nper vessel ranges from $8 million to $200 million.\r\n\r\nPottengal Mukundan, Director of ICC's Commercial\r\nCrime Services states in an IMB press release:\r\n\"(Piracy) typically involves a mother ship from which to\r\nlaunch the attacks, a supply of automatic weapons, false\r\nidentity papers for the crew and vessel, fake cargo\r\ndocuments, and a broker network to sell the stolen goods\r\nillegally. Individual pirates don't have these resources.\r\n\r\nHijackings are the work of organized crime rings\".\r\n\r\nThe IMB describes the aftermath of a typical hijacking:\r\n\"The Global Mars has probably been given a new name\r\nand repainted. Armed with false registration papers and\r\nbills of lading, the pirates - or more likely the mafia\r\nbosses pulling the strings - will then try to dispose of their\r\nbooty. The vessel has probably put in to a port where the\r\nfalse identity of vessel and cargo may escape detection.\r\n\r\nEven when identified, the gangs have been known to bribe\r\nlocal officials to allow them to sell the cargo and leave the\r\nport\".\r\n\r\nSuch a ship is often \"recycled\" a few times. It earns its\r\noperators an average of $40-50 million per \"cycle\",\r\naccording to \"The Economist\". The pirates contract with\r\nsellers or shipping agents to load it with a legitimate\r\nconsignment of goods or commodities. The sellers and\r\nagents are unaware of the true identity of the ship, or of its\r\nunsavory \"owners/managers\".\r\n\r\nThe pirates invariably produce an authentic vessel\r\nregistration certificate that they acquired from crooked\r\nofficials - and provide the sellers or agents with a bill of\r\nlading. The payload is then sold to networks of traders in\r\nstolen merchandise or to gullible buyers in a different port\r\nof destination - and the ship is ready for yet another\r\nround.\r\n\r\nIn January 2002, the Indonesian Navy has permanently\r\nstationed six battleships in the Malacca Straits, three of\r\nthem off the coast of the secessionist region of Aceh. A\r\nfurther 20-30 ships and 10 aircraft conduct daily patrols of\r\nthe treacherous traffic lane. Some 200-600 ships cross the\r\nStraits daily. A mere 50 ships or so are boarded and\r\nsearched every month.\r\n\r\nThe Greek government has gunboats patrolling the 2\r\nmiles wide Corfu Channel, where yachts frequently fall\r\nprey to Albanian pirates. Brazil has imposed an unpopular\r\nanti-piracy inspection fee on berthing vessels and used the\r\nproceeds to finance a SWAT team to protect ships and\r\ntheir crews while in port. Both India and Thailand have\r\nsimilar units.\r\n\r\nInternational cooperation is also on the rise. About one\r\nthird of the world's shipping traffic goes through the\r\nSouth China Sea. A conference convened by Japan in\r\nMarch 2000 - Japanese vessels have become favored\r\ntargets of piracy in the last few years - pushed for the\r\nratification of the International Maritime Organisation's\r\n(IMO) 1988 Rome Convention on the Suppression of\r\nUnlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation\r\nby Asian and ASEAN countries.\r\n\r\nThe Convention makes piracy an extraterritorial crime\r\nand, thus, removes the thorny issue of jurisdiction in cases\r\nof piracy carried in another country's territorial waters or\r\nout on the high seas. The Comite Maritime International -\r\nthe umbrella organization of national maritime law\r\nassociations - promulgated a model anti-piracy law last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThough it rejected Japan's offer for collaboration, in a\r\nsharp reversal of its previous policy, China started\r\nhanding down death sentences against murderous pirates.\r\n\r\nThe 13 marauders who seized the Cheung Son and\r\nmassacred its 23 Chinese sailors were executed five years\r\nago in the southern city of Shanwei. Another 25 people\r\nreceived long prison sentences. The - declared - booty\r\namounted to a mere $300,000.\r\n\r\nIndia and Iran - two emerging \"pirates safe harbor\"\r\ndestinations - have also tightened up sentencing and port\r\ninspections. In the Alondra Rainbow hijacking, the Indian\r\nNavy captured the Indonesian culprits in a cinematic\r\nchase off Goa. They were later sentenced severely under\r\nboth the Indian Penal Code and international law. Even\r\nthe junta in Myanmar has taken tentative steps against\r\ncompatriots with piratical predilections.\r\n\r\nLaw enforcement does not tolerate a vacuum. \"The\r\nEconomist\" reports about two private military companies\r\n- Marine Risk Management and Satellite Protection\r\nServices (SPS) - which deploy airborne mercenaries to\r\ndeal with piracy. SPS has even suggested to station 2500\r\nformer Dutch marines in Subic Bay in the Philippines -\r\nfor a mere $2500 per day per combatant.\r\n\r\nShipowners are desperate. Quoted by \"The Economist\",\r\nthey \"suggest that the region's governments negotiate the\r\nright for navies to chase pirates across national\r\nboundaries: the so-called 'right of hot pursuit'. So far, only\r\nSingapore and Indonesia have negotiated limited rights.\r\n\r\nSome suggest that the American navy should be invited\r\ninto territorial waters to combat piracy, a 'live' exercise it\r\nmight relish. At the very least, countries such as Indonesia\r\nshould advertise which bits of their territorial waters at\r\nany time are patrolled and safe from pirates. No countries\r\ncurrently do this\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.  Legalizing Crime\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso Read:\r\nNarcissists, Ethnic or Religious Affiliation, and Terrorists\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Those who have the command of the arms in a country\r\nare masters of the state, and have it in their power to\r\nmake what revolutions they please. [Thus,] there is no\r\nend to observations on the difference between the\r\nmeasures likely to be pursued by a minister backed by a\r\nstanding army, and those of a court awed by the fear of\r\nan armed people\".\r\n\r\nAristotle (384-322 BC), Greek philosopher\r\n\"Murder being the very foundation of our social\r\ninstitutions, it is consequently the most imperious\r\nnecessity of civilised life. If there were no murder,\r\ngovernment of any sort would be inconceivable. For the\r\nadmirable fact is that crime in general, and murder in\r\nparticular, not simply excuses it but represents its only\r\nreason to exist ... Otherwise we would live in complete\r\nanarchy, something we find unimaginable ..\".\r\n\r\nOctave Mirbeau (1848-1917), The Torture Garden\r\nThe state has a monopoly on behaviour usually deemed\r\ncriminal. It murders, kidnaps, and locks up people.\r\n\r\nSovereignty has come to be identified with the unbridled -\r\nand exclusive - exercise of violence. The emergence of\r\nmodern international law has narrowed the field of\r\npermissible conduct. A sovereign can no longer commit\r\ngenocide or ethnic cleansing with impunity, for instance.\r\n\r\nMany acts - such as the waging of aggressive war, the\r\nmistreatment of minorities, the suppression of the freedom\r\nof association - hitherto sovereign privilege, have\r\nthankfully been criminalized. Many politicians, hitherto\r\nimmune to international prosecution, are no longer so.\r\n\r\nConsider Yugoslavia's Milosevic and Chile's Pinochet.\r\n\r\nBut, the irony is that a similar trend of criminalization -\r\nwithin national legal systems - allows governments to\r\noppress their citizenry to an extent previously unknown.\r\n\r\nHitherto civil torts, permissible acts, and common\r\nbehaviour patterns are routinely criminalized by\r\nlegislators and regulators. Precious few are\r\ndecriminalized.\r\n\r\nConsider, for instance, the criminalization in the\r\nEconomic Espionage Act (1996) of the misappropriation\r\nof trade secrets and the criminalization of the violation of\r\ncopyrights in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\r\n(2000) - both in the USA. These used to be civil torts.\r\n\r\nThey still are in many countries. Drug use, common\r\nbehaviour in England only 50 years ago - is now criminal.\r\n\r\nThe list goes on.\r\n\r\nCriminal laws pertaining to property have malignantly\r\nproliferated and pervaded every economic and private\r\ninteraction. The result is a bewildering multitude of laws,\r\nregulations statutes, and acts.\r\n\r\nThe average Babylonian could have memorizes and\r\nassimilated the Hammurabic code 37 centuries ago - it\r\nwas short, simple, and intuitively just.\r\n\r\nEnglish criminal law - partly applicable in many of its\r\nformer colonies, such as India, Pakistan, Canada, and\r\nAustralia - is a mishmash of overlapping and\r\ncontradictory statutes - some of these hundreds of years\r\nold - and court decisions, collectively known as \"case\r\nlaw\".\r\n\r\nDespite the publishing of a Model Penal Code in 1962 by\r\nthe American Law Institute, the criminal provisions of\r\nvarious states within the USA often conflict. The typical\r\nAmerican can't hope to get acquainted with even a\r\nnegligible fraction of his country's fiendishly complex and\r\nhopelessly brobdignagian criminal code. Such inevitable\r\nignorance breeds criminal behaviour - sometimes\r\ninadvertently - and transforms many upright citizens into\r\ndelinquents.\r\n\r\nIn the land of the free - the USA - close to 2 million adults\r\nare behind bars and another 4.5 million are on probation,\r\nmost of them on drug charges. The costs of\r\ncriminalization - both financial and social - are mind\r\nboggling. According to \"The Economist\", America's\r\nprison system cost it $54 billion a year - disregarding the\r\nprice tag of law enforcement, the judiciary, lost product,\r\nand rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nWhat constitutes a crime? A clear and consistent\r\ndefinition has yet to transpire.\r\n\r\nThere are five types of criminal behaviour: crimes against\r\noneself, or \"victimless crimes\" (such as suicide, abortion,\r\nand the consumption of drugs), crimes against others\r\n(such as murder or mugging), crimes among consenting\r\nadults (such as incest, and in certain countries,\r\nhomosexuality and euthanasia), crimes against collectives\r\n(such as treason, genocide, or ethnic cleansing), and\r\ncrimes against the international community and world\r\norder (such as executing prisoners of war). The last two\r\ncategories often overlap.\r\n\r\nThe Encyclopaedia Britannica provides this definition of a\r\ncrime: \"The intentional commission of an act usually\r\ndeemed socially harmful or dangerous and specifically\r\ndefined, prohibited, and punishable under the criminal\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\nBut who decides what is socially harmful? What about\r\nacts committed unintentionally (known as \"strict liability\r\noffences\" in the parlance)? How can we establish\r\nintention - \"mens rea\", or the \"guilty mind\" - beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt?\r\nA much tighter definition would be: \"The commission of\r\nan act punishable under the criminal law.\" A crime is\r\nwhat the law - state law, kinship law, religious law, or any\r\nother widely accepted law - says is a crime. Legal systems\r\nand texts often conflict.\r\n\r\nMurderous blood feuds are legitimate according to the\r\n15th century \"Qanoon\", still applicable in large parts of\r\nAlbania. Killing one's infant daughters and old relatives is\r\nsocially condoned - though illegal - in India, China,\r\nAlaska, and parts of Africa. Genocide may have been\r\nlegally sanctioned in Germany and Rwanda - but is\r\nstrictly forbidden under international law.\r\n\r\nLaws being the outcomes of compromises and power\r\nplays, there is only a tenuous connection between justice\r\nand morality. Some \"crimes\" are categorical imperatives.\r\n\r\nHelping the Jews in Nazi Germany was a criminal act -\r\nyet a highly moral one.\r\n\r\nThe ethical nature of some crimes depends on\r\ncircumstances, timing, and cultural context. Murder is a\r\nvile deed - but  assassinating Saddam Hussein may be\r\nmorally commendable. Killing an embryo is a crime in\r\nsome countries - but not so killing a fetus. A \"status\r\noffence\" is not a criminal act if committed by an adult.\r\n\r\nMutilating the body of a live baby is heinous - but this is\r\nthe essence of Jewish circumcision. In some societies,\r\ncriminal guilt is collective. All Americans are held\r\nblameworthy by the Arab street for the choices and\r\nactions of their leaders. All Jews are accomplices in the\r\n\"crimes\" of the \"Zionists\".\r\n\r\nIn all societies, crime is a growth industry. Millions of\r\nprofessionals - judges, police officers, criminologists,\r\npsychologists, journalists, publishers, prosecutors,\r\nlawyers, social workers, probation officers, wardens,\r\nsociologists, non-governmental-organizations, weapons\r\nmanufacturers, laboratory technicians, graphologists, and\r\nprivate detectives - derive their livelihood, parasitically,\r\nfrom crime. They often perpetuate models of punishment\r\nand retribution that lead to recidivism rather than to to the\r\nreintegration of criminals in society and their\r\nrehabilitation.\r\n\r\nOrganized in vocal interest groups and lobbies, they harp\r\non the insecurities and phobias of the alienated urbanites.\r\n\r\nThey consume ever growing budgets and rejoice with\r\nevery new behaviour criminalized by exasperated\r\nlawmakers. In the majority of countries, the justice system\r\nis a dismal failure and law enforcement agencies are part\r\nof the problem, not its solution.\r\n\r\nThe sad truth is that many types of crime are considered\r\nby people to be normative and common behaviours and,\r\nthus, go unreported. Victim surveys and self-report studies\r\nconducted by criminologists reveal that most crimes go\r\nunreported. The protracted fad of criminalization has\r\nrendered criminal many perfectly acceptable and recurring\r\nbehaviours and acts. Homosexuality, abortion, gambling,\r\nprostitution, pornography, and suicide have all been\r\ncriminal offences at one time or another.\r\n\r\nBut the quintessential example of over-criminalization is\r\ndrug abuse.\r\n\r\nThere is scant medical evidence that soft drugs such as\r\ncannabis or MDMA (\"Ecstasy\") - and even cocaine - have\r\nan irreversible effect on brain chemistry or functioning.\r\n\r\nLast month an almighty row erupted in Britain when Jon\r\nCole, an addiction researcher at Liverpool University,\r\nclaimed, to quote \"The Economist\" quoting the\r\n\"Psychologist\", that:\r\n\"Experimental evidence suggesting a link between\r\nEcstasy use and problems such as nerve damage and brain\r\nimpairment  is flawed ... using this ill-substantiated cause-\r\nand-effect to tell the 'chemical generation' that they are\r\nbrain damaged when they are not creates public health\r\nproblems of its own\".\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is commonly accepted that alcohol abuse and\r\nnicotine abuse can be at least as harmful as the abuse of\r\nmarijuana, for instance. Yet, though somewhat curbed,\r\nalcohol consumption and cigarette smoking are legal. In\r\ncontrast, users of cocaine - only a century ago\r\nrecommended by doctors as tranquilizer - face life in jail\r\nin many countries, death in others. Almost everywhere pot\r\nsmokers are confronted with prison terms.\r\n\r\nThe \"war on drugs\" - one of the most expensive and\r\nprotracted in history - has failed abysmally. Drugs are\r\nmore abundant and cheaper than ever. The social costs\r\nhave been staggering: the emergence of violent crime\r\nwhere none existed before, the destabilization of drug-\r\nproducing countries, the collusion of drug traffickers with\r\nterrorists, and the death of millions - law enforcement\r\nagents, criminals, and users.\r\n\r\nFew doubt that legalizing most drugs would have a\r\nbeneficial effect. Crime empires would crumble\r\novernight, users would be assured of the quality of the\r\nproducts they consume, and the addicted few would not\r\nbe incarcerated or stigmatized - but rather treated and\r\nrehabilitated.\r\n\r\nThat soft, largely harmless, drugs continue to be illicit is\r\nthe outcome of compounded political and economic\r\npressures by lobby and interest groups of manufacturers\r\nof legal drugs, law enforcement agencies, the judicial\r\nsystem, and the aforementioned long list of those who\r\nbenefit from the status quo.\r\n\r\nOnly a popular movement can lead to the\r\ndecriminalization of the more innocuous drugs. But such a\r\ncrusade should be part of a larger campaign to reverse the\r\noverall tide of criminalization. Many \"crimes\" should\r\nrevert to their erstwhile status as civil torts. Others should\r\nbe wiped off the statute books altogether. Hundreds of\r\nthousands should be pardoned and allowed to reintegrate\r\nin society, unencumbered by a past of transgressions\r\nagainst an inane and inflationary penal code.\r\n\r\nThis, admittedly, will reduce the leverage the state has\r\ntoday against its citizens and its ability to intrude on their\r\nlives, preferences, privacy, and leisure. Bureaucrats and\r\npoliticians may find this abhorrent. Freedom loving\r\npeople should rejoice.\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX - Should Drugs be Legalized?\r\nThe decriminalization of drugs is a tangled issue\r\ninvolving many separate moral/ethical and practical\r\nstrands which can, probably, be summarized thus:\r\n\r\n(a) Whose body is it anyway? Where do I start and the\r\ngovernment begins? What gives the state the right to\r\nintervene in decisions pertaining only to my self and\r\ncontravene them?\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL:\r\n\r\nThe government exercises similar \"rights\" in other cases\r\n(abortion, military conscription, sex)\r\n\r\n(b) Is the government the optimal moral agent, the best or\r\nthe right arbiter, as far as drug abuse is concerned?\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL:\r\n\r\nFor instance, governments collaborate with the illicit drug\r\ntrade when it fits their realpolitik purposes.\r\n\r\n(c) Is substance abuse a personal or a social choice? Can\r\none limit the implications, repercussions and outcomes of\r\none's choices in general and of the choice to abuse drugs,\r\nin particular? If the drug abuser in effect makes decisions\r\nfor others, too - does it justify the intervention of the\r\nstate? Is the state the agent of society, is it the only agent\r\nof society and is it the right agent of society in the case of\r\ndrug abuse?\r\n\r\n(d) What is the difference (in rigorous philosophical\r\nprinciple) between legal and illegal substances? Is it\r\nsomething in the nature of the substances? In the usage\r\nand what follows? In the structure of society? Is it a moral\r\nfashion?\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL:\r\n\r\nDoes scientific research support or refute common myths\r\nand ethos regarding drugs and their abuse?\r\n\r\nIs scientific research influenced by the current anti-drugs\r\ncrusade and hype? Are certain facts suppressed and\r\ncertain subjects left unexplored?\r\n\r\n(e) Should drugs be decriminalized for certain purposes\r\n(e.g., marijuana and glaucoma)? If so, where should the\r\nline be drawn and by whom?\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL:\r\n\r\nRecreational drugs sometimes alleviate depression.\r\n\r\nShould this use be permitted?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. Begging Your Trust in Africa\r\n\r\n\r\nThe syntax is tortured, the grammar mutilated, but the\r\nmessage - sent by snail mail, telex, fax, or e-mail - is\r\ncoherent: an African bigwig or his heirs wish to transfer\r\nfunds amassed in years of graft and venality to a safe bank\r\naccount in the West. They seek the recipient's permission\r\nto make use of his or her inconspicuous services for a\r\npercentage of the loot - usually many millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nA fee is required to expedite the proceedings, or to pay\r\ntaxes, or to bribe officials - they plausibly explain. A\r\nrecent (2005) variant involves payment with expertly\r\nforged postal money orders for goods exported to a transit\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nIt is a scam two decades old - and it still works. In\r\nSeptember 2002, a bookkeeper for a Berkley, Michigan\r\nlaw firm embezzled $2.1 million and wired it to various\r\nbank accounts in South Africa and Taiwan. Other victims\r\nwere kidnapped for ransom as they traveled abroad to\r\ncollect their \"share\". Some never made it back. Every\r\nyear, there are 5 such murders as well as 8-10 snatchings\r\nof American citizens alone. The usual ransom demanded\r\nis half a million to a million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe scam is so widespread that the Nigerians saw fit to\r\nexplicitly ban it in article 419 of their penal code. The\r\nNigerian President, Olusegun Obasanjo castigated the\r\nfraudsters for inflicting \"incalculable damage to Nigerian\r\nbusinesses\" and for \"placing the entire country under\r\nsuspicion\".\r\n\"Wired\" quotes statistics presented at the International\r\nConference on Advance Fee (419) Frauds in New York on\r\nSept. 17, 2002:\r\n\"Roughly 1 percent of the millions of people who receive\r\n419 e-mails and faxes are successfully scammed. Annual\r\nlosses to the scam in the United States total more than\r\n$100 million, and law enforcement officials believe\r\nglobal losses may total over $1.5 billion\".\r\n\r\nAccording to the \"IFCC 2001 Internet Fraud Report\",\r\npublished by the FBI and the National White Collar Crime\r\nCenter, Nigerian letter fraud cases amount to 15.5 percent\r\nof all grievances. The Internet Fraud Complaint Center\r\nrefers such rip-offs to the US Secret Service. While the\r\nmedian loss in all manner of Internet fraud was $435 - in\r\nthe Nigerian scam it was a staggering $5575. But only one\r\nin ten successful crimes is reported, says the FBI's report.\r\n\r\nThe IFCC provides this advisory to potential targets:\r\n? Be skeptical of individuals representing\r\nthemselves as Nigerian or other foreign\r\ngovernment officials asking for your help in\r\nplacing large sums of money in overseas bank\r\naccounts.\r\n? Do not believe the promise of large sums of\r\nmoney for your cooperation.\r\n? Do not give out any personal information\r\nregarding your savings, checking, credit, or other\r\nfinancial accounts.\r\n? If you are solicited, do not respond and quickly\r\nnotify the appropriate authorities.\r\n\r\nThe \"419 Coalition\" is more succinct and a lot more\r\npessimistic:\r\n1. \"NEVER pay anything up front for ANY reason.\r\n2. NEVER extend credit for ANY reason.\r\n3. NEVER do ANYTHING until their check clears.\r\n4. NEVER expect ANY help from the Nigerian\r\nGovernment.\r\n5. NEVER rely on YOUR Government to bail you\r\nout\".\r\n\r\nThe State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics\r\nand Law Enforcement Affairs published a brochure titled\r\n\"Nigerian Advance Fee Fraud\". It describes the history of\r\nthis particular type of  swindle:\r\n\"AFF criminals include university-educated\r\nprofessionals who are the best in the world for\r\nnonviolent spectacular crimes. AFF letters first surfaced\r\nin the mid-1980s around the time of the collapse of\r\nworld oil prices, which is Nigeria's main foreign\r\nexchange earner. Some Nigerians turned to crime in\r\norder to survive. Fraudulent schemes such as AFF\r\nsucceeded in Nigeria, because Nigerian criminals took\r\nadvantage of the fact that Nigerians speak English, the\r\ninternational language of business, and the country's\r\nvast oil wealth and natural gas reserves - ranked 13th in\r\nthe world - offer lucrative business opportunities that\r\nattract many foreign companies and individuals\".\r\n\r\nAccording to London's Metropolitan Police Company\r\nFraud Department, potential targets in the UK and the\r\nUSA alone receive c. 1500 solicitations a week. The US\r\nSecret Service Financial Crime Division takes in 100 calls\r\na day from Americans approach by the con-men. It now\r\nacknowledges that \"Nigerian organized crime rings\r\nrunning fraud schemes through the mail and phone lines\r\nare now so large, they represent a serious financial threat\r\nto the country\".\r\n\r\nSometimes even the stamps affixed to such letters are\r\nforged. Nigerian postal workers are known to be in\r\ncahoots with the fraudsters. Names and addresses are\r\nobtained from \"trade journals, business directories,\r\nmagazine and newspaper advertisements, chambers of\r\ncommerce, and the Internet\".\r\n\r\nVictims are either too intimidated to complain or else\r\nreluctant to admit their collusion in money laundering and\r\nfraud. Others try in vain to recoup their losses by\r\nploughing more money into the scheme.\r\n\r\nContrary to popular image, the scammers are often violent\r\nand involved in other criminal pursuits, such as drug\r\ntrafficking, According to Nigeria's Drug Law\r\nEnforcement Agency. The blight has spread to other\r\ncountries. Letters from Sierra Leone, Ghana, Congo,\r\nLiberia, Togo, Ivory Coast, Benin, Burkina Faso, South\r\nAfrica, Taiwan, or even Canada, the United Kingdom,\r\nOman, and Vietnam are not uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe dodges fall into a few categories.\r\n\r\nOver-invoiced contract scams involve the ostensible\r\ntransfer of amounts obtained through inflated invoices to\r\nthe bank account of an unrelated foreign firm. Contract\r\nfraud or \"trade default\" is simply a bogus order\r\naccompanied by a fraudulent bank draft (or fake postal or\r\nother money order) for the products of an export company\r\naccompanied by demand for \"samples\" and various\r\ntransaction \"fees and charges\".\r\n\r\nSome of the rackets are plain outlandish. In the \"wash-\r\nwash\" confidence trick people have been known to pay up\r\nto $200,000 for a special solution to remove stains from\r\nmillions in defaced dollar notes. Others \"bought\" heavily\r\n\"discounted\" crude oil stored in \"secret\" locations - or real\r\nestate in rezoned locales. \"Clearing houses\" or \"venture\r\ncapital organizations\" claiming to act on behalf of the\r\nCentral Bank of Nigeria launder the proceeds of the\r\nscams.\r\n\r\nIn another twist, charities, academic institutions, nonprofit\r\norganizations, and religious groups are asked to pay the\r\ninheritances tax on a \"donation\". Some \"dignitaries\" and\r\ntheir relatives may seek to flee the country and ask the\r\nvictims to advance the bribe money in return for a\r\ngenerous cut of the wealth they have stashed abroad.\r\n\"Bankers\" may find inactive accounts with millions of\r\ndollars - often in lottery winnings - waiting to be\r\ntransferred to a safe off-shore haven. Bogus jobs with\r\ninflated wages are another ostensible way to defraud state-\r\nowned companies - as is the sale of the target's used\r\nvehicle to them for an extravagant price. There seems to\r\nbe no end to criminal ingenuity.\r\n\r\nLately, the correspondence purports to be coming from -\r\noften white - disinterested professional third parties.\r\n\r\nAccountants, lawyers, directors, trustees, security\r\npersonnel, or bankers pretend to be acting as fiduciaries\r\nfor the real dignitary in need of help. Less gullible victims\r\nare subjected to plain old extortion with verbal\r\nintimidation and stalking.\r\n\r\nThe more heightened public awareness grows with over-\r\nexposure and the tighter the net of international\r\ncooperation against the scam, the wilder the stories it\r\nspawns. Letters have surfaced recently signed by dying\r\nrefugees, tsunami victims, survivors of the September 11\r\nattacks, and serendipitous US commandos on mission in\r\nAfghanistan.\r\n\r\nGovernments throughout the world have geared up to\r\nprotect their businessmen. The US Department of\r\nCommerce, for instance, publishes the \"World Traders\r\ndata Report\", compiled by US embassy in Nigeria. It\r\n\"provides the following types of information: types of\r\norganizations, year established, principal owners, size,\r\nproduct line, and financial and trade references\".\r\n\r\nUnilateral US activity, inefficacious collaboration with the\r\nNigerian government some of whose officials are rumored\r\nto be in on the deals, multilateral efforts in the framework\r\nof the OECD and the Interpol, education and information\r\ncampaigns - nothing seems to be working.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of 419 fraudsters in Nigeria is so lenient\r\nthat, according to the \"Nigeria Tribune\", the United States\r\nthreatened the country with sanctions if it does not\r\nconsiderably improve its record on financial crime by\r\nNovember 2002. Both the US Treasury's Financial Crime\r\nEnforcement Network (FINCEN) and the OECD's\r\nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) had characterized\r\nthe country as \"one of the worst perpetrators of financial\r\ncrimes in the world\". The Nigerian central bank promises\r\nto get to grips with this debilitating problem.\r\n\r\nNigerian themselves - though often victims of the scams -\r\ntake the phenomenon in stride. The Nigerian \"Daily\r\nChampion\", proffered this insightful apologia on behalf of\r\nthe ruthless and merciless 419 gangs. It is worth quoting\r\nat length:\r\n\"To eradicate the 419 scourge, leaders at all levels\r\nshould work assiduously to create employment\r\nopportunities and people perception of the leaders as\r\nrole models. The country's very high unemployment\r\nfigure has made nonsense of the so-called democracy\r\ndividends. Great majority of Nigerian youthful school\r\nleaver's including University graduates, are without\r\nvisible means of livelihood... The fact remains that most\r\nof these teeming youths cannot just watch our so-called\r\nleaders siphon their God-given wealthy. So, they resorted\r\nto alternative fraudulent means of livelihood called 419,\r\nat least to be seen as have arrived... Some of these 419ers\r\nare in the National Assembly and the State Houses of\r\nAssembly while some surround the President and\r\ngovernors across the country\".\r\n\r\nSome swindlers seek to glorify their criminal activities\r\nwith a political and historical context. The Web site of the\r\n\"419 Coalition\" contains letters casting the scam as a form\r\nof forced reparation for slavery, akin to the compensation\r\npaid by Germany to survivors of the holocaust. The\r\nconfidence tricksters boast of defrauding the \"white\r\ncivilization\" and unmasking the falsity of its claims for\r\nsuperiority. But a few delusional individuals aside, this is\r\nnothing but a smokescreen.\r\n\r\nGreed outweighs fear and avarice enmeshes people in\r\nclearly criminal enterprises. The \"victims\" of advance fee\r\nscams are rarely incognizant of their alleged role. They\r\nknowingly and intentionally collude with self-professed\r\ncriminals to fleece governments and institutions. This is\r\none of the rare crimes where prey and perpetrator may\r\nwell deserve each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. Organ Trafficking in Eastern Europe\r\n\r\n\r\nA kidney fetches $2700 in Turkey. According to the\r\nOctober 2002 issue of the Journal of the American\r\nMedical Association, this is a high price. An Indian or\r\nIraqi kidney enriches its former owner by a mere $1000.\r\n\r\nWealthy clients later pay for the rare organ up to\r\n$150,000.\r\n\r\nCBS News aired, five years ago, a documentary, filmed\r\nby Antenna 3 of Spain, in which undercover reporters in\r\nMexico were asked, by a priest acting as a middleman for\r\na doctor, to pay close to 1 million dollars for a single\r\nkidney. An auction of a human kidney on eBay in\r\nFebruary 2000 drew a bid of $100,000 before the\r\ncompany put a stop to it. Another auction in September\r\n1999 drew $5.7 million - though, probably, merely as a\r\nprank.\r\n\r\nOrgan harvesting operations flourish in Turkey, in central\r\nEurope, mainly in the Czech Republic, and in the\r\nCaucasus, mainly in Georgia. They operate on Turkish,\r\nMoldovan, Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Romanian,\r\nBosnian, Kosovar, Macedonian, Albanian and assorted\r\neast European donors.\r\n\r\nThey remove kidneys, lungs, pieces of liver, even corneas,\r\nbones, tendons, heart valves, skin and other sellable\r\nhuman bits. The organs are kept in cold storage and air\r\nlifted to illegal distribution centers in the United States,\r\nGermany, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, Israel, South\r\nAfrica, and other rich, industrialized locales. It gives\r\n\"brain drain\" a new, spine chilling, meaning.\r\n\r\nOrgan trafficking has become an international trade. It\r\ninvolves Indian, Thai, Philippine, Brazilian, Turkish and\r\nIsraeli doctors who scour the Balkan and other destitute\r\nregions for tissues. The Washington Post reported, in\r\nNovember 2002, that in a single village in Moldova, 14\r\nout of 40 men were reduced by penury to selling body\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, Moldova cut off the thriving baby\r\nadoption trade due to an - an unfounded - fear the toddlers\r\nwere being dissected for spare organs. According to the\r\nIsraeli daily, Ha'aretz, the Romanians are investigating\r\nsimilar allegations in Israel and have withheld permission\r\nto adopt Romanian babies from dozens of eager and out of\r\npocket couples. American authorities are scrutinizing a\r\ntwo year old Moldovan harvesting operation based in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nOrgan theft and trading in Ukraine is a smooth operation.\r\n\r\nAccording to news agencies, in August 2002, three\r\nUkrainian doctors were charged in Lvov with trafficking\r\nin the organs of victims of road accidents. The doctors\r\nused helicopters to ferry kidneys and livers to colluding\r\nhospitals. They charged up to $19,000 per organ.\r\n\r\nThe West Australian daily surveyed in January 2002 the\r\nthriving organs business in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Sellers\r\nare offering their wares openly, through newspaper ads.\r\n\r\nPrices reach up to $68,000. Compared to an average\r\nmonthly wage of less than $200, this is an unimaginable\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nNational health insurance schemes turn a blind eye.\r\n\r\nIsrael's participates in the costs of purchasing organs\r\nabroad, though only subject to rigorous vetting of the\r\nsources of the donation. Still, a May 2001 article in a the\r\nNew York Times Magazine, quotes \"the coordinator of\r\nkidney transplantation at Hadassah University Hospital in\r\nJerusalem (as saying that) 60 of the 244 patients currently\r\nreceiving post-transplant care purchased their new kidney\r\nfrom a stranger - just short of 25 percent of the patients at\r\none of Israel's largest medical centers participating in the\r\norgan business\".\r\n\r\nMany Israelis - attempting to avoid scrutiny - travel to\r\neast Europe, accompanied by Israeli doctors, to perform\r\nthe transplantation surgery. These junkets are\r\neuphemistically known as \"transplant tourism\". Clinics\r\nhave sprouted all over the benighted region. Israeli\r\ndoctors have recently visited impoverished Macedonia,\r\nBulgaria, Kosovo and Yugoslavia to discuss with local\r\nbusinessmen and doctors the setting up of kidney\r\ntransplant clinics.\r\n\r\nSuch open involvement in what can be charitably\r\ndescribed as a latter day slave trade gives rise to a new\r\nwave of thinly disguised anti-Semitism. The Ukrainian\r\nEcho, quoting the Ukrinform news agency, reported, on\r\nJanuary 7, 2002, that, implausibly, a Ukrainian guest\r\nworker died in Tel-Aviv in mysterious circumstances and\r\nhis heart was removed. The Interpol, according to the\r\npaper, is investigating this lurid affair.\r\n\r\nAccording to scholars, reports of organ thefts and related\r\nabductions, mainly of children, have been rife in Poland\r\nand Russia at least since 1991. The buyers are supposed to\r\nbe rich Arabs.\r\n\r\nNancy Scheper-Hughes, an anthropologist at the\r\nUniversity of California at Berkeley and co-founder of\r\nOrgans Watch, a research and documentation center, is\r\nalso a member and co-author of the Bellagio Task Force\r\nReport on Transplantation, Bodily Integrity and the\r\nInternational Traffic in Organs. In a report presented in\r\nJune 2001 to the House Subcommittee on International\r\nOperations and Human Rights, she substantiated at least\r\nthe nationality of the alleged buyers, though not the urban\r\nlegends regarding organ theft:\r\n\r\n\"In the Middle East residents of the Gulf States (Kuwait,\r\nSaudi Arabia, and Oman) have for many years traveled to\r\nIndia, the Philippines, and to Eastern Europe to purchase\r\nkidneys made scarce locally due to local fundamentalist\r\nIslamic teachings that allow organ transplantation (to save\r\na life), but prohibit organ harvesting from brain-dead\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, hundreds of kidney patients from Israel,\r\nwhich has its own well -developed, but under-used\r\ntransplantation centers (due to ultra-orthodox Jewish\r\nreservations about brain death) travel in 'transplant tourist'\r\njunkets to Turkey, Moldova, Romania where desperate\r\nkidney sellers can be found, and to Russia where an\r\nexcess of lucrative cadaveric organs are produced due to\r\nlax standards for designating brain death, and to South\r\nAfrica where the amenities in transplantation clinics in\r\nprivate hospitals can resemble four star hotels.\r\n\r\nWe found in many countries - from Brazil and Argentina\r\nto India, Russia, Romania, Turkey to South Africa and\r\nparts of the United States - a kind of 'apartheid medicine'\r\nthat divides the world into two distinctly different\r\npopulations of 'organs supplies' and 'organs receivers'.\"\r\n\r\nRussia, together with Estonia, China and Iraq, is, indeed, a\r\nmajor harvesting and trading centre. International news\r\nagencies described, five years ago, how a grandmother in\r\nRyazan tried to sell her grandchild to a mediator. The boy\r\nwas to be smuggled to the West and there dismembered\r\nfor his organs. The uncle, who assisted in the matter, was\r\nsupposed to collect $70,000 - a fortune in Russian terms.\r\n\r\nWhen confronted by the European Union on this issue,\r\nRussia responded that it lacks the resources required to\r\nmonitor organ donations. The Italian magazine, Happy\r\nWeb, reports that organ trading has taken to the Internet.\r\n\r\nA simple query on the Google search engine yields\r\nthousands of Web sites purporting to sell various body\r\nparts - mostly kidneys - for up to $125,000. The sellers are\r\nRussian, Moldovan, Ukrainian and Romanian.\r\n\r\nScheper-Hughes, an avid opponent of legalizing any form\r\nof trade in organs, says that \"in general, the movement\r\nand flow of living donor organs - mostly kidneys - is from\r\nSouth to North, from poor to rich, from black and brown\r\nto white, and from female to male bodies\".\r\n\r\nYet, in the summer of 2002, bowing to reality, the\r\nAmerican Medical Association commissioned a study to\r\nexamine the effects of paying for cadaveric organs would\r\nhave on the current shortage. The 1984 National Organ\r\nTransplant Act that forbids such payments is also under\r\nattack. Bills to amend it were submitted recently by\r\nseveral Congressmen. These are steps in the right\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOrgan trafficking is the outcome of the international ban\r\non organ sales and live donor organs. But wherever there\r\nis demand there is a market. Excruciating poverty of\r\npotential donors, lengthening patient waiting lists and the\r\nbetter quality of organs harvested from live people make\r\norgan sales an irresistible proposition. The medical\r\nprofessions and authorities everywhere would do better to\r\nlegalize and regulate the trade rather than transform it into\r\na form of organized crime. The denizens of Moldova\r\nwould surely appreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. Selling Arms to Rogue States\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\nRussian Roulette - The Security Apparatus\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a desperate bid to fend off sanctions, the Bosnian\r\ngovernment banned yesterday all trade in arms and\r\nmunitions. A local, Serb-owned company was\r\ndocumented by the State Department selling spare parts\r\nand maintenance for military aircraft to Iraq via Yugoslav\r\nshell companies.\r\n\r\nHeads rolled. In the Republika Srpska, the Serb\r\ncomponent of the ramshackle Bosnian state, both the\r\nDefense Minister Slobodan Bilic and army Chief of Staff\r\nNovica Simic resigned. Another casualty was the general\r\ndirector of the Orao Aircraft Institute of Bijeljina - Milan\r\nPrica. On the Yugoslav side, Jugoimport chief Gen Jovan\r\nCekovic and federal Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Djokic\r\nstood down.\r\n\r\nBosnia's is only the latest in a series of embarrassing\r\ndisclosures in practically every country of the former\r\neastern bloc, including all the EU accession candidates.\r\n\r\nWith the crumbling of the Warsaw pact and the\r\neconomies of the region, millions of former military and\r\nsecret service operators resorted to peddling weapons and\r\nmartial expertise to rogue states, terrorist outfits, and\r\norganized crime. The confluence - and, lately,\r\nconvergence - of these interests is threatening Europe's\r\nvery stability.\r\n\r\nLast week, the Polish \"Rzeczpospolita\" accused the\r\nMilitary Information services (WSI) of illicit arms sales\r\nbetween 1992-6 through both private and state-run\r\nentities. The weapons were plundered from the Polish\r\narmy and sold at half price to Croatia and Somalia, both\r\nunder UN arms embargo.\r\n\r\nDeals were struck with the emerging international\r\noperations of the Russian mafia. Terrorist middlemen and\r\nLatvian state officials were involved. Breaching Poland's\r\ndemocratic veneer, the Polish Ministry of Defense\r\nthreatened to sue the paper for disclosing state secrets.\r\n\r\nPolice in Lodz is still investigating the alarming\r\ndisappearance of 4 Arrow anti-aircraft missiles from a\r\ntrain transporting arms from a factory to the port of\r\nGdansk, to be exported. The private security escort claim\r\ninnocence.\r\n\r\nThe Czech Military Intelligence Services (VZS) have long\r\nbeen embroiled in serial scandals. The Czech defense\r\nattaché to India, Miroslav Kvasnak, was recently fired for\r\ndisobeying explicit orders from the minister of defense.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jane's, Kvasnak headed URNA - the elite\r\nanti-terrorist unit of the Czech National Police. He was\r\nsacked in 1995 for selling Semtex, the notorious Czech\r\nplastic explosive, as well as weapons and munitions to\r\norganized crime gangs.\r\n\r\nIn late August, the Czechs arrested arms traffickers,\r\nmembers of an international ring, for selling Russian\r\nweapons - including, incredibly, tanks, fighter planes,\r\nnaval vessels, long range rockets, and missile platforms -\r\nto Iraq. The operation has lasted 3 years and was\r\nconducted from Prague.\r\n\r\nAccording to the \"Wall Street Journal\", the Czech\r\nintelligence services halted the sale of $300 million worth\r\nof the Tamara radar systems to Iraq in 1997. Czech firms,\r\nsuch as Agroplast, a leading waste processing company,\r\nhave often been openly accused of weapons smuggling.\r\n\"The Guardian\" tracked in February a delivery of missiles\r\nand guidance systems from the Czech Republic through\r\nSyria to Iraq.\r\n\r\nGerman go-betweens operate in the Baltic countries. In\r\nMay a sale of more than two pounds of the radioactive\r\nelement cesium-137 was thwarted in Vilnius, the capital\r\nof Lithuania. The substance was sold to terrorist groups\r\nbent on producing a \"dirty bomb\", believe US officials\r\nquoted by \"The Guardian\". The Director of the CIA, John\r\nDeutsch, testified in Congress in 1996 about previous\r\ncases in Lithuania involving two tons of radioactive\r\nwolfram and 220 pounds of uranium-238.\r\n\r\nStill, the epicenters of the illicit trade in weapons are in\r\nthe Balkan, in Russia, and in the republics of the former\r\nSoviet Union. Here, domestic firms intermesh with\r\nWestern intermediaries, criminals, terrorists, and state\r\nofficials to engender a pernicious, ubiquitous and\r\nmalignant web of smuggling and corruption.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Center for Public Integrity and the\r\nWestern media, over the last decade, renegade Russian\r\narmy officers have sold weapons to every criminal and\r\nterrorist organization in the world - from the IRA to al-\r\nQaida and to every failed state, from Liberia to Libya.\r\n\r\nThey are protected by well-connected, bribe-paying, arms\r\ndealers and high-level functionaries in every branch of\r\ngovernment. They launder the proceeds through Russian\r\noil multinationals, Cypriot, Balkan, and Lebanese banks,\r\nand Asian, Swiss, Austrian, and British trading\r\nconglomerates - all obscurely owned and managed.\r\n\r\nThe most serious breach of the united international front\r\nagainst Iraq may be the sale of the $100 million anti-\r\nstealth Ukrainian Kolchuga radar to the pariah state two\r\nyears ago. Taped evidence suggests that president Leonid\r\nKuchma himself instructed the General Director of the\r\nUkrainian arms sales company, UkrSpetzExport, Valery\r\nMalev to conclude the deal. Malev died in a mysterious\r\ncar accident on March 6, three days after his taped\r\nconversation with Kuchma surfaced.\r\n\r\nThe Ukrainians insist that they were preempted by\r\nRussian dealers who sold a similar radar system to Iraq -\r\nbut this is highly unlikely as the Russian system was still\r\nin development at the time. the American and British are\r\ncurrently conducting a high-profile investigation in Kyiv.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, illegal arms are traded mainly by the Western\r\nGroup of Forces in cahoots with private companies, both\r\ndomestic and foreign. The Air Defense Army specializes\r\nin selling light arms. The army is the main source of\r\nweapons - plastic explosives, grenade launchers,\r\nmunitions - of both Chechen rebels and Chechen\r\ncriminals. Contrary to received opinion, volunteer-\r\nsoldiers, not conscripts, control the arms trade. The state\r\nitself is involved in arms proliferation. Sales to China and\r\nIran were long classified. From June, all sales of materiel\r\nenjoy \"state secret\" status.\r\n\r\nThere is little the US can do. The Bush administration has\r\nimposed in May sanctions on Armenian and Moldovan\r\ncompanies, among others, for aiding and abetting Iran's\r\nefforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction. Armenian\r\npresident, Robert Kocharian, indignantly denied\r\nknowledge of such transactions and vowed to get to the\r\nbottom of the American allegations.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Policy Research Institute, quoted by Radio\r\nFree Europe/Radio Liberty, described a \"Department of\r\nEnergy (DOE) initiative, underway since 1993, to\r\nimprove 'material protection, control and accountability' at\r\nformer Soviet nuclear enterprises. The program enjoys\r\nsubstantial bipartisan support in the United States and is\r\nconsidered the first line of defense\r\nagainst unwanted proliferation episodes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As of February 2000, more than 8 years after the collapse\r\nof the USSR, new security systems had been installed at\r\n113 buildings, most of them in Russia; however, these\r\nsites contained only 7 percent of the estimated 650 tons of\r\nweapons-usable material considered at risk for theft or\r\ndiversion. DOE plans call for safeguarding 60 percent of\r\nthe material by 2006 and the rest in 10 to 15 years or\r\nlonger\".\r\n\r\nRussian traders learned to circumvent official channels\r\nand work through Belarus. Major General Stsyapan\r\nSukharenka, the first deputy chief of the Belarusian KGB,\r\ndenied, in March, any criminal arms trading in his\r\ncountry. This vehement protest is gainsaid by the\r\npreponderance of Belarusian arms traders replete with\r\nfake end-user certificates in Croatia during the Yugoslav\r\nwars of secession (1992-5).\r\n\r\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State Steven Pifer said that\r\nUN inspectors unearthed Belarusian artillery in Iraq in\r\n1996. Iraqis are also being trained in Belarus to operate\r\nvarious advanced weapons systems. The secret services\r\nand armies of Ukraine, Russia, and even Romania use\r\nBelarus to mask the true origin of weapons sold in\r\ncontravention of UN sanctions.\r\n\r\nWestern arms manufacturers lobby their governments to\r\nenhance their sales. Legitimate Russian and Ukrainian\r\nsales are often thwarted by Western political arm-twisting.\r\n\r\nWhen Macedonia, in the throes of a civil war it was about\r\nto lose, purchased helicopter gunships from Ukraine, the\r\nAmerican Embassy leaned on the government to annul the\r\ncontracts and threatened to withhold aid and credits if it\r\ndoes not succumb.\r\n\r\nThe duopoly, enjoyed by the USA and Russia, forces\r\ncompetitors to go underground and to seek rogue or\r\nfelonious customers. Yugoslav scientists, employed by\r\nJugoimport and other firms run by former army officers,\r\nare developing cruise missiles for Iraq, alleges the\r\nAmerican administration. The accusation, though, is\r\ndubious as Iraq has no access to satellites to guide such\r\nmissiles.\r\n\r\nAnother Yugoslav firm, Brunner, constructed a Libyan\r\nrocket propellant manufacturing facility. In an interview\r\nto the \"Washington Post\", Yugoslavia's president Vojislav\r\nKostunica brushed off the American complaints about, as\r\nhe put it disdainfully, \"overhauling older-generation\r\naircraft engines\".\r\n\r\nSuch exploits are not unique to Yugoslavia or Bosnia. The\r\nCroat security services are notorious for their collusion in\r\ndrug and arms trafficking, mainly via Hungary.\r\n\r\nMacedonian construction companies collaborate with\r\nmanufacturers of heavy machinery and purveyors of\r\nmissile technology in an effort to recoup hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars in Iraqi debts. Albanian crime gangs\r\ncollude with weapon smugglers based in Montenegro and\r\nKosovo. The Balkan - from Greece to Hungary - is\r\nteeming with these penumbral figures.\r\n\r\nArms smuggling is a by-product of criminalized societies,\r\ndestitution, and dysfunctional institutions. The prolonged\r\nperiod of failed transition in countries such as Yugoslavia,\r\nMacedonia, Bosnia, Moldova, Belarus, and Ukraine has\r\nentrenched organized crime. It now permeates every\r\nlegitimate economic sphere and every organ of the state.\r\n\r\nWhether this situation is reversible is the subject of heated\r\ndebate. But it is the West which pays the price in\r\nincreased crime rates and, probably in Iraq, in added\r\nfatalities once it launches war against that murderous\r\nregime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.   The Industrious Spies\r\n\r\nBy: Dr. Sam Vaknin\r\nAlso published by United Press International (UPI)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Web site of GURPS (Generic Universal Role Playing\r\nSystem) lists 18 \"state of the art equipments (sic) used for\r\nadvanced spying\". These include binoculars to read lips,\r\nvoice activated bugs, electronic imaging devices,\r\ncomputer taps, electromagnetic induction detectors,\r\nacoustic stethoscopes, fiber optic scopes, detectors of\r\nacoustic emissions (e.g., of printers), laser mikes that can\r\ndecipher and amplify voice-activated vibrations of\r\nwindows, and other James Bond gear.\r\n\r\nSuch contraptions are an integral part of industrial\r\nespionage. The American Society for Industrial Security\r\n(ASIC) estimated a few years ago that the damage caused\r\nby economic or commercial espionage to American\r\nindustry between 1993-5 alone was c. $63 billion.\r\n\r\nThe average net loss per incident reported was $19 million\r\nin high technology, $29 million in services, and $36\r\nmillion in manufacturing. ASIC than upped its estimate to\r\n$300 billion in 1997 alone - compared to $100 billion\r\nassessed by the 1995 report of the White House Office of\r\nScience and Technology.\r\n\r\nThis figures are mere extrapolations based on anecdotal\r\ntales of failed espionage. Many incidents go unreported.\r\n\r\nIn his address to the 1998 World Economic Forum, Frank\r\nCiluffo, Deputy Director of the CSIS Global Organized\r\nCrime Project, made clear why:\r\n\"The perpetrators keep quiet for obvious reasons. The\r\nvictims do so out of fear. It may jeopardize shareholder\r\nand consumer confidence. Employees may lose their jobs.\r\n\r\nIt may invite copycats by inadvertently revealing\r\nvulnerabilities. And competitors may take advantage of\r\nthe negative publicity. In fact, they keep quiet for all the\r\nsame reasons corporations do not report computer\r\nintrusions\".\r\n\r\nInteractive Television Technologies complained - in a\r\npress release dated August 16, 1996 - that someone broke\r\ninto its Amherst, NY, offices and stole \"three computers\r\ncontaining the plans, schematics, diagrams and\r\nspecifications for the BUTLER, plus a number of\r\ncomputer disks with access codes.\" BUTLER is a\r\nproprietary technology which helps connect television to\r\ncomputer networks, such as the Internet. It took four years\r\nto develop.\r\n\r\nIn a single case, described in the Jan/Feb 1996 issue of\r\n\"Foreign Affairs\", Ronald Hoffman, a software scientist,\r\nsold secret applications developed for the Strategic\r\nDefense Initiative to Japanese corporations, such as\r\nNissan Motor Company, Mitsubishi Electric, Mitsubishi\r\nHeavy Industries, and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy\r\nIndustries. He was caught in 1992, having received\r\n$750,000 from his \"clients\", who used the software in\r\ntheir civilian aerospace projects.\r\n\r\nCanal Plus Technologies, a subsidiary of French media\r\ngiant Vivendi, filed a lawsuit last March against NDS, a\r\ndivision of News Corp. Canal accused NDS of hacking\r\ninto its pay TV smart cards and distributing the cracked\r\ncodes freely on a piracy Web site. It sued NDS for $1.1\r\nbillion in lost revenues. This provided a rare glimpse into\r\ninformation age, hacker-based, corporate espionage\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\nExecutives of publicly traded design software developer\r\nAvant! went to jail for purchasing batches of computer\r\ncode from former employees of Cadence in 1997.\r\n\r\nReuters Analytics, an American subsidiary of Reuters\r\nHoldings, was accused in 1998 of theft of proprietary\r\ninformation from Bloomberg by stealing source codes\r\nfrom its computers.\r\n\r\nIn December 2001, Say Lye Ow, a Malaysian subject and\r\na former employee of Intel, was sentenced to 24 months in\r\nprison for illicitly copying computer files containing\r\nadvanced designs of Intel's Merced (Itanium)\r\nmicroprocessor. It was the crowning achievement of a\r\ncollaboration between the FBI's High-Tech squad and the\r\nUS Attorney's Office CHIP - Computer Hacking and\r\nIntellectual Property - unit.\r\n\r\nU.S. Attorney David W. Shapiro said: \"People and\r\ncompanies who steal intellectual property are thieves just\r\nas bank robbers are thieves. In this case, the Itanium\r\nmicroprocessor is an extremely valuable product that took\r\nIntel and HP years to develop. These cases should send\r\nthe message throughout Silicon Valley and the Northern\r\nDistrict that the U.S. Attorney's Office takes seriously the\r\ntheft of intellectual property and will prosecute these\r\ncases to the full extent of the law\".\r\n\r\nYet, such cases are vastly more common than publicly\r\nacknowledged.\r\n\"People have struck up online friendships with employers\r\nand then lured them into conspiracy to commit espionage.\r\n\r\nPeople have put bounties on laptops of executives. People\r\nhave disguised themselves as janitors to gain physical\r\naccess,\" Richard Power, editorial director of the Computer\r\nSecurity Institute told MSNBC.\r\n\r\nMarshall Phelps, IBM Vice President for Commercial and\r\nIndustry Relations admitted to the Senate Judiciary\r\nCommittee as early as April 1992:\r\n\"Among the most blatant actions are outright theft of\r\ncorporate proprietary assets. Such theft has occurred from\r\nmany quarters: competitors, governments seeking to\r\nbolster national industrial champions, even employees.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, IBM has been the victim of such acts\".\r\n\r\nRaytheon, a once thriving defense contractor, released\r\n\"SilentRunner\", a $25,000-65,000 software package\r\ndesigned to counter the \"insider threat\". Its brochure,\r\nquoted by \"Wired\", says:\r\n\"We know that 84 percent of your network threats can be\r\nexpected to come from inside your organization.... This\r\nleast intrusive of all detection systems will guard the\r\nintegrity of your network against abuses from\r\nunauthorized employees, former employees, hackers or\r\nterrorists and competitors\".\r\n\r\nThis reminds many of the FBI's Carnivore massive\r\nnetwork sniffer software. It also revives the old dilemma\r\nbetween privacy and security. An Omni Consulting\r\nsurvey of 3200 companies worldwide pegged damage\r\ncaused by insecure networks at $12 billion.\r\n\r\nThere is no end to the twists and turns of espionage cases\r\nand to the creativity shown by the perpetrators.\r\n\r\nOn June 2001 an indictment was handed down against\r\nNicholas Daddona. He stands accused of a unique\r\nvariation on the old theme of industrial espionage: he was\r\nemployed by two firms - transferring trade secrets from\r\none (Fabricated Metal Products) to the other (Eyelet).\r\n\r\nJungsheng Wang was indicted last year for copying the\r\narchitecture of the Sequoia ultrasound machine developed\r\nby Acuson Corporation. He sold it to Bell Imaging, a\r\nCalifornian company which, together with a Chinese firm,\r\nowns a mainland China corporation, also charged in the\r\ncase. The web of collaboration between foreign - or\r\nforeign born - scientists with access to trade and\r\ntechnology secrets, domestic corporations and foreign\r\nfirms, often a cover for government interests - is clearly\r\nexposed here.\r\n\r\nKenneth Cullen and Bruce Zak were indicted on April\r\n2001 for trying to purchase a printed or text version of the\r\nsource code of a computer application for the processing\r\nof health care benefit claim forms developed by ZirMed.\r\n\r\nThe legal status of printed source code is unclear. It is\r\nundoubtedly intellectual property - but of which kind? Is it\r\nsoftware or printed matter?\r\nPeter Morch, a senior R&D team leader for CISCO was\r\naccused on March 2001 for simply burning onto compact\r\ndiscs all the intellectual property he could lay his hands on\r\nwith the intent of using it in his new workplace, Calix\r\nNetworks, a competitor of CISCO.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most bizarre case involves Fausto Estrada. He\r\nwas employed by a catering company that served the\r\nprivate lunches to Mastercard's board of directors. He\r\noffered to sell Visa proprietary information that he\r\nclaimed to have stolen from Mastercard. In a letter signed\r\n\"Cagliostro\", Fausto demanded $1 million. He was caught\r\nred-handed in an FBI sting operation on February 2001.\r\n\r\nMultinationals are rarely persecuted even when known to\r\nhave colluded with offenders. Steven Louis Davis pleaded\r\nguilty on January 1998 to stealing trade secrets and\r\ndesigns from Gillette and selling them to its competitors,\r\nsuch as Bic Corporation, American Safety Razor, and\r\nWarner Lambert. Yet, it seems that only he paid the price\r\nfor his misdeeds - 27 months in prison. Bic claims to have\r\nimmediately informed Gillette of the theft and to have\r\ncollaborated with Gillette's Legal Department and the\r\nFBI.\r\n\r\nNor are industrial espionage or the theft of intellectual\r\nproperty limited to industry. Mayra Justine Trujillo-Cohen\r\nwas sentenced on October 1998 to 48 months in prison for\r\nstealing proprietary software from Deloitte-Touche, where\r\nshe worked as a consultant, and passing it for its own.\r\n\r\nCaroll Lee Campbell, the circulation manager of Gwinette\r\nDaily Post (GDP), offered to sell proprietary business and\r\nfinancial information of his employer to lawyers\r\nrepresenting a rival paper locked in bitter dispute with\r\nGDP.\r\n\r\nNor does industrial espionage necessarily involve\r\nclandestine, cloak and dagger, operations. The Internet\r\nand information technology are playing an increasing role.\r\n\r\nIn a bizarre case, Caryn Camp developed in 1999 an\r\nInternet-relationship with a self-proclaimed entrepreneur,\r\nStephen Martin. She stole he employer's trade secrets for\r\nMartin in the hope of attaining a senior position in\r\nMartin's outfit - or, at least, of being richly rewarded.\r\n\r\nCamp was exposed when she mis-addressed an e-mail\r\nexpressing her fears - to a co-worker.\r\n\r\nSteven Hallstead and Brian Pringle simply advertised their\r\nwares - designs of five advanced Intel chips - on the Web.\r\n\r\nThey were, of course, caught and sentenced to more than\r\n5 years in prison. David Kern copied the contents of a\r\nlaptop inadvertently left behind by a serviceman of a\r\ncompeting firm. Kern trapped himself. He was forced to\r\nplead the Fifth Amendment during his deposition in a civil\r\nlawsuit he filed against his former employer. This, of\r\ncourse, provoked the curiosity of the FBI.\r\n\r\nStolen trade secrets can spell the difference between\r\nextinction and profitability. Jack Shearer admitted to\r\nbuilding an $8 million business on trade secrets pilfered\r\nfrom Caterpillar and Solar Turbines.\r\n\r\nUnited States Attorney Paul E. Coggins stated: \"This is\r\nthe first EEA case in which the defendants pled guilty to\r\ntaking trade secret information and actually converting the\r\nstolen information into manufactured products that were\r\nplaced in the stream of commerce. The sentences handed\r\ndown today (June 15, 2000) are among the longest\r\nsentences ever imposed in an Economic Espionage case\".\r\n\r\nEconomic intelligence gathering - usually based on open\r\nsources - is both legitimate and indispensable. Even\r\nreverse engineering - disassembling a competitor's\r\nproducts to learn its secrets - is a grey legal area. Spying is\r\ndifferent. It involves the purchase or theft of proprietary\r\ninformation illicitly. It is mostly committed by firms. But\r\ngovernments also share with domestic corporations and\r\nmultinationals the fruits of their intelligence networks.\r\n\r\nFormer - and current - intelligence operators (i.e., spooks),\r\npolitical and military information brokers, and assorted\r\nshady intermediaries - all switched from dwindling Cold\r\nWar business to the lucrative market of \"competitive\r\nintelligence\".\r\n\r\nUS News and World Report described on May 6, 1996,\r\nhow a certain Mr. Kota - an alleged purveyor of secret\r\nmilitary technology to the KGB in the 1980's - conspired\r\nwith a scientist, a decade later, to smuggle\r\nbiotechnologically modified hamster ovaries to India.\r\n\r\nThis transition fosters international tensions even among\r\nallies. \"Countries don't have friends - they have interests!\"\r\n- screamed a DOE poster in the mid-nineties. France has\r\nvigorously protested US spying on French economic and\r\ntechnological developments - until it was revealed to be\r\ndoing the same. French relentless and unscrupulous\r\npursuit of purloined intellectual property in the USA is\r\ndescribed in Peter Schweizer's \"Friendly Spies: How\r\nAmerica's Allies Are Using Economic Espionage to Steal\r\nOur Secrets.\"\r\n\"Le Mond\" reported back in 1996 about intensified\r\nAmerican efforts to purchase from French bureaucrats and\r\nlegislators information regarding France's WTO,\r\ntelecommunications, and audio-visual policies. Several\r\nCIA operators were expelled.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, according to Robert Dreyfuss in the January\r\n1995 issue of \"Mother Jones\", Non Official Cover (NOC)\r\nCIA operators - usually posing as businessmen - are\r\nstationed in Japan. These agents conduct economic and\r\ntechnological espionage throughout Asia, including in\r\nSouth Korea and China.\r\n\r\nEven the New York Times chimed in, accusing American\r\nintelligence agents of assisting US trade negotiators by\r\neavesdropping on Japanese officials during the car\r\nimports row in 1995. And President Clinton admitted\r\nopenly that intelligence gathered by the CIA regarding the\r\nillegal practices of French competitors allowed American\r\naerospace firms to win multi-billion dollar contracts in\r\nBrazil and Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nThe respected German weekly, Der Spiegel, castigated the\r\nUSA, in 1990, for arm-twisting the Indonesian\r\ngovernment into splitting a $200 million satellite contract\r\nbetween the Japanese NEC and US manufacturers. The\r\nAmerican, alleged the magazines, intercepted messages\r\npertaining to the deal, using the infrastructure of the\r\nNational Security Agency (NSA). Brian Gladwell, a\r\nformer NATO computer expert, calls it \"state-sponsored\r\ninformation piracy\".\r\n\r\nRobert Dreyfuss, writing in \"Mother Jones\", accused the\r\nCIA of actively gathering industrial intelligence (i.e.,\r\nstealing trade secrets) and passing them on to America's\r\nBig Three carmakers. He quoted Clinton administration\r\nofficials as saying: \"(the CIA) is a good source of\r\ninformation about the current state of technology in a\r\nforeign country ... We've always managed to get\r\nintelligence to the business community. There is contact\r\nbetween business people and the intelligence community,\r\nand information flows both ways, informally\".\r\n\r\nA February 1995 National Security Strategy statement\r\ncited by MSNBC declared:\r\n\"Collection and analysis can help level the economic\r\nplaying field by identifying threats to U.S. companies\r\nfrom foreign intelligence services and unfair trading\r\npractices\".\r\n\r\nThe Commerce Department's Advocacy Center solicits\r\ncommercial information thus:\r\n\"Contracts pursued by foreign firms that receive\r\nassistance from their home governments to pressure a\r\ncustomer into a buying decision; unfair treatment by\r\ngovernment decision-makers, preventing you from a\r\nchance to compete; tenders tied up in bureaucratic red\r\ntape, resulting in lost opportunities and unfair advantage\r\nto a competitor. If these or any similar export issues are\r\naffecting your company, it's time to call the Advocacy\r\nCenter\".\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there is Echelon.\r\n\r\nExposed two years ago by the European Parliament in\r\ngreat fanfare, this telecommunications interception\r\nnetwork, run by the US, UK, New Zealand, Australia, and\r\nCanada has become the focus of bitter mutual\r\nrecriminations and far flung conspiracy theories.\r\n\r\nThese have abated following the brutal terrorist attacks of\r\nSeptember 11 when the need for Echelon-like system with\r\neven laxer legal control was made abundantly clear.\r\n\r\nFrance, Russia, and 28 other nations operate indigenous\r\nmini-Echelons, their hypocritical protestations to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nBut, with well over $600 billion a year invested in easily\r\npilfered R&D, the US is by far the prime target and main\r\nvictim of such activities rather than their chief perpetrator.\r\n\r\nThe harsh - and much industry lobbied - \"Economic\r\nEspionage (and Protection of Proprietary Economic\r\nInformation) Act of 1996\" defines the criminal offender\r\nthus:\r\n\"Whoever, intending or knowing that the offense will\r\nbenefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality,\r\nor foreign agent, knowingly\" and \"whoever, with intent to\r\nconvert a trade secret, that is related to or included in a\r\nproduct that is produced for or placed in interstate or\r\nforeign commerce, to the economic benefit of anyone\r\nother than the owner thereof, and intending or knowing\r\nthat the offense will , injure any owner of that trade\r\nsecret\":\r\n\"(1) steals, or without authorization appropriates, takes,\r\ncarries away, or conceals, or by fraud, artifice, or\r\ndeception obtains a trade secret (2) without authorization\r\ncopies, duplicates, sketches, draws, photographs,\r\ndownloads, uploads, alters, destroys, photocopies,\r\nreplicates, transmits, delivers, sends, mails,\r\ncommunicates, or conveys a trade secret (3) receives,\r\nbuys, or possesses a trade secret, knowing the same to\r\nhave been stolen or appropriated, obtained, or converted\r\nwithout authorization (4) attempts to commit any offense\r\ndescribed in any of paragraphs (1) through (3); or (5)\r\nconspires with one or more other persons to commit any\r\noffense described in any of paragraphs (1) through (4),\r\nand one or more of such persons do any act to effect the\r\nobject of conspiracy\".\r\n\r\nOther countries either have similar statutes (e.g., France) -\r\nor are considering to introduce them. Taiwan's National\r\nSecurity Council has been debating a local version of an\r\neconomic espionage law lat month. There have been\r\ndozens of prosecutions under the law hitherto. Companies\r\n- such as \"Four Pillars\" which stole trade secrets from\r\nAvery Dennison - paid fines of millions of US dollars.\r\n\r\nEmployees - such as PPG's Patrick Worthing - and their\r\naccomplices were jailed.\r\n\r\nForeign citizens - like the Taiwanese Kai-Lo Hsu and\r\nProf. Charles Ho from National Chiao Tung university -\r\nwere detained. Mark Halligan of Welsh and Katz in\r\nChicago lists on his Web site more than 30 important\r\neconomic espionage cases tried under the law by July last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe Economic Espionage law authorizes the FBI to act\r\nagainst foreign intelligence gathering agencies toiling on\r\nUS soil with the aim of garnering proprietary economic\r\ninformation. During the Congressional hearings that\r\npreceded the law, the FBI estimated that no less that 23\r\ngovernments, including the Israeli, French, Japanese,\r\nGerman, British, Swiss, Swedish, and Russian, were busy\r\ndoing exactly that. Louis Freeh, the former director of the\r\nFBI, put it succinctly: \"Economic Espionage is the\r\ngreatest threat to our national security since the Cold\r\nWar\".\r\n\r\nThe French Ministry of Foreign Affairs runs a program\r\nwhich commutes military service to work at high tech US\r\nfirms. Program-enrolled French computer engineers were\r\narrested attempting to steal proprietary source codes from\r\ntheir American employers.\r\n\r\nIn an interview he granted to the German ZDF Television\r\nquoted by \"Daily Yomiuri\" and Netsafe, the former\r\nDirector of the French foreign counterintelligence service,\r\nthe DGSE, freely confessed:\r\n\"....All secret services of the big democracies undertake\r\neconomic espionage ... Their role is to peer into hidden\r\ncorners and in that context business plays an important\r\npart ... In France the state is not just responsible for the\r\nlaws, it is also an entrepreneur. There are state-owned and\r\nsemi-public companies. And that is why it is correct that\r\nfor decades the French state regulated the market with its\r\nright hand in some ways and used its intelligence service\r\nwith its left hand to furnish its commercial companies ... It\r\nis among the tasks of the secret services to shed light on\r\nand analyze the white, grey and black aspects of the\r\ngranting of such major contracts, particularly in far-off\r\ncountries\".\r\n\r\nThe FBI investigated 400 economic espionage cases in\r\n1995 - and 800 in 1996. It interfaces with American\r\ncorporations and obtains investigative leads from them\r\nthrough its 26 years old Development of Espionage,\r\nCounterintelligence, and Counter terrorism Awareness\r\n(DECA) Program renamed ANSIR (Awareness of\r\nNational Security Issues and Response). Every local FBI\r\noffice has a White Collar Crime squad in charge of\r\nthwarting industrial espionage. The State Department runs\r\na similar outfit called the Overseas Security Advisory\r\nCouncil (OSAC).\r\n\r\nThese are massive operations. In 1993-4 alone, the FBI\r\nbriefed well over a quarter of a million corporate officers\r\nin more than 20,000 firms. By 1995, OSAC collaborated\r\non overseas security problems with over 1400 private\r\nenterprises. \"Country Councils\", comprised of embassy\r\nofficial and private American business, operate in dozens\r\nof foreign cities. They facilitate the exchange of timely\r\n\"unclassified\" and threat-related security information.\r\n\r\nMore than 1600 US companies and organization are\r\ncurrently permanently affiliated wit OSAC. Its Advisory\r\nCouncil is made up of twenty-one private sector and four\r\npublic sector member organizations that, according to\r\nOSAC, \"represent specific industries or agencies that\r\noperate abroad. Private sector members serve for two to\r\nthree years. More than fifty U.S. companies and\r\norganizations have already served on the Council.\r\n\r\nMember organizations designate representatives to work\r\non the Council.\r\n\r\nThese representatives provide the direction and guidance\r\nto develop programs that most benefit the U.S. private\r\nsector overseas. Representatives meet quarterly and staff\r\ncommittees tasked with specific projects. Current\r\ncommittees include Transnational Crime, Country\r\nCouncil Support, Protection of Information and\r\nTechnology, and Security Awareness and Education\".\r\n\r\nBut the FBI is only one of many agencies that deal with\r\nthe problem in the USA. The President's Annual Report to\r\nCongress on \"Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial\r\nEspionage\" dated July 1995, describes the multiple\r\ncompetitive intelligence (CI) roles of the Customs\r\nService, the Department of Defense, the Department of\r\nEnergy, and the CIA.\r\n\r\nThe federal government alerts its contractors to CI threats\r\nand subjects them to \"awareness programs\" under the\r\nDOD's Defense Information Counter Espionage (DICE)\r\nprogram. The Defense Investigative Service (DIS)\r\nmaintains a host of useful databases such as the Foreign\r\nOwnership, Control, or Influence (FOCI) register. It is\r\nactive otherwise as well, conducting personal security\r\ninterviews by industrial security representatives and\r\nkeeping tabs on the foreign contacts of security cleared\r\nfacilities. And the list goes on.\r\n\r\nAccording to the aforementioned report to Congress:\r\n\"The industries that have been the targets in most cases of\r\neconomic espionage and other collection activities include\r\nbiotechnology; aerospace; telecommunications, including\r\nthe technology to build the 'information superhighway';\r\ncomputer software/ hardware; advanced transportation\r\nand engine technology; advanced materials and coatings,\r\nincluding 'stealth' technologies; energy research; defense\r\nand armaments technology; manufacturing processes; and\r\nsemiconductors. Proprietary business information-that is,\r\nbid, contract, customer, and strategy in these sectors is\r\naggressively targeted. Foreign collectors have also shown\r\ngreat interest in government and corporate financial and\r\ntrade data\".\r\n\r\nThe collection methods range from the traditional - agent\r\nrecruitment and break ins - to the technologically\r\nfantastic. Mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, research\r\nand development partnerships, licensing and franchise\r\nagreements, friendship societies, international exchange\r\nprograms, import-export companies - often cover up for\r\nold fashioned reconnaissance. Foreign governments\r\ndisseminate disinformation to scare off competitors - or\r\nlure then into well-set traps.\r\n\r\nForeign students, foreign employees, foreign tourist\r\nguides, tourists, immigrants, translators, affable\r\nemployees of NGO's, eager consultants, lobbyists, spin\r\ndoctors, and mock journalists are all part of national\r\nconcerted efforts to prevail in the global commercial\r\njungle. Recruitment of traitors and patriots is at its peak in\r\ninternational trade fairs, air shows, sabbaticals, scientific\r\ncongresses, and conferences.\r\n\r\nOn May 2001, Takashi Okamoto and Hiroaki Serizwa\r\nwere indicted of stealing DNA and cell line reagents from\r\nLerner Research Institute and the Cleveland Clinic\r\nFoundation. This was done on behalf of the Institute of\r\nPhysical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in Japan - an\r\noutfit 94 funded by the Japanese government. The\r\nindictment called RIKEN \"an instrumentality of the\r\ngovernment of Japan\".\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications\r\nwas involved on May 2001 in an egregious case of theft of\r\nintellectual property. Two development scientists of\r\nChinese origin transferred the PathStar Access Server\r\ntechnology to a Chinese corporation owned by the\r\nministry. The joint venture it formed with the\r\nthieves promptly came out with its own product probably\r\nbased on the stolen secrets.\r\n\r\nThe following ad appeared in the Asian Wall Street\r\nJournal in 1991 - followed by a contact phone number in\r\nwestern Europe:\r\n\"Do you have advanced/privileged information of any\r\ntype of project/contract that is going to be carried out in\r\nyour country? We hold commission/agency agreements\r\nwith many large European companies and could introduce\r\nthem to your project/contract. Any commission received\r\nwould be shared with yourselves\".\r\n\r\nBen Venzke, publisher of Intelligence Watch Report,\r\ndescribes how Mitsubishi filed c. 1500 FOIA (Freedom of\r\nInformation Act) requests in 1987 alone, in an effort to\r\nenter the space industry. The US Patent office is another\r\ngreat source of freely available proprietary information.\r\n\r\nIndustrial espionage is not new. In his book, \"War by\r\nOther Means: Economic Espionage in America\", The\r\nWall Street Journal's John Fialka, vividly describes how\r\nFrances Cabot Lowell absconded from Britain with the\r\nplans for the cutting edge Cartwright loom in 1813.\r\n\r\nStill, the phenomenon has lately become more egregious\r\nand more controversial. As Cold War structures - from\r\nNATO to the KGB and the CIA - seek to redefine\r\nthemselves and to assume new roles and new functions,\r\neconomic espionage offers a tempting solution.\r\n\r\nMoreover, decades of increasing state involvement in\r\nmodern economies have blurred the traditional\r\ndemarcation between the private and the public sectors.\r\n\r\nMany firms are either state-owned (in Europe) or state-\r\nfinanced (in Asia) or sustained by state largesse and\r\npatronage (the USA). Many businessmen double as\r\npoliticians and numerous politicians serve on corporate\r\nboards.\r\n\r\nEisenhower's \"military-industrial complex\" though not as\r\nsinister as once imagined is, all the same, a reality. The\r\ndeployment of state intelligence assets and resources to\r\nhelp the private sector gain a competitive edge is merely\r\nits manifestation.\r\n\r\nAs foreign corporate ownership becomes widespread, as\r\nmultinationals expand, as nation-states dissolve into\r\nregions and coalesce into supranational states - the classic,\r\nexclusionary, and dichotomous view of the world (\"we\"\r\nversus \"they\") will fade. But the notion of \"proprietary\r\ninformation\" is here to stay. And theft will never cease as\r\nlong as there is profit to be had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.  Russia's Idled Spies\r\n\r\nAlso Read\"\r\nThe Industrious Spies\r\nRussian Roulette - The Security Apparatus\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 11, 2002, Sweden expelled two Russian\r\ndiplomats for spying on radar and missile guidance\r\ntechnologies for the JAS 39 British-Swedish Gripen\r\nfighter jet developed by Telefon AB LM Ericsson, the\r\ntelecommunications multinational. The Russians\r\nthreatened to reciprocate. Five current and former\r\nemployees of the corporate giant are being investigated.\r\n\r\nIronically, the first foreign buyer of the aircraft may well\r\nbe Poland, a former Soviet satellite state and a current\r\nEuropean Union candidate.\r\n\r\nSweden arrested in February 2001 a worker of the Swiss-\r\nSwedish engineering group, ABB, on suspicion of spying\r\nfor Russia. The man was released after two days for lack\r\nof evidence and reinstated. But the weighty Swedish\r\ndaily, Dagens Nyheter, speculated that the recent Russian\r\nindiscretion was in deliberate retaliation for Swedish\r\nespionage in Russia. Sweden is rumored to have been in\r\nthe market for Russian air radar designs and the JAS radar\r\nsystem is said by some observers to uncannily resemble\r\nits eastern counterparts.\r\n\r\nThe same day, a Russian military intelligence (GRU)\r\ncolonel, Aleksander Sipachev, was sentenced in Moscow\r\nto eight years in prison and stripped of his rank.\r\n\r\nAccording to Russian news agencies, he was convicted of\r\nattempting to sell secret documents to the CIA. Russian\r\nsecret service personnel, idled by the withering of Russia's\r\nglobal presence, resort to private business or are re-\r\ndeployed by the state to spy on industrial and economic\r\nsecrets in order to aid budding Russian multinationals.\r\n\r\nAccording to the FBI and the National White-collar Crime\r\nCenter, Russian former secret agents have teamed with\r\ncomputer hackers to break into corporate networks to steal\r\nvital information about product development and\r\nmarketing strategies. Microsoft has admitted to such a\r\ncompromising intrusion.\r\n\r\nIn a December 1999 interview to Segodnya, a Russia\r\npaper, Eyer Winkler, a former high-ranking staffer with\r\nthe National Security Agency (NSA) confirmed that\r\n\"corruption in the Russian Government, the Foreign\r\nIntelligence Service, and the Main Intelligence\r\nDepartment allows Russian organized criminal groups to\r\nuse these departments in their own interests. Criminals\r\nreceive the major part of information collected by the\r\nRussian special services by means of breaking into\r\nAmerican computer networks\".\r\n\r\nWhen the KGB was dismantled and replaced by a host of\r\nnew acronyms, Russian industrial espionage was still in\r\ndiapers. as a result, it is a bureaucratic no-man's land\r\nroamed by agents of the GRU, the Foreign Intelligence\r\nService (SVR), and smaller outfits, such as the Federal\r\nAgency on Government Communications and Information\r\n(FAPSI).\r\n\r\nAccording to Stratfor, the strategic forecasting\r\nconsultancy, \"the SVR and GRU both handle manned\r\nintelligence on U.S. territory, with the Russian Federal\r\nSecurity Service (FSB) doing counterintelligence in\r\nAmerica. Also, both the SVR and GRU have internal\r\ncounterintelligence units created for finding foreign\r\nintelligence moles.\" This, to some extent, is the division\r\nof labor in Europe as well.\r\n\r\nGermany's Federal Prosecutor has consistently warned\r\nagainst $5 billion worth of secrets pilfered annually from\r\nGerman industrial firms by foreign intelligence services,\r\nespecially from east Europe and Russia. The\r\nCounterintelligence News and Developments newsletter\r\npegs the damage at $13 billion in 1996 alone:\r\n\"Modus operandi included placing agents in\r\ninternational organizations, setting up joint-ventures\r\nwith German companies, and setting up bogus\r\ncompanies. The (Federal Prosecutor's) report also\r\nwarned business leaders to be particularly wary of\r\nformer diplomats or people who used to work for foreign\r\nsecret services because they often had the language\r\nskills and knowledge of Germany that made them\r\nexcellent agents\".\r\n\r\nRussian spy rings now operate from Canada to Japan.\r\n\r\nMany of the spies have been dormant for decades and\r\nrecalled to service following the implosion of the USSR.\r\n\r\nAccording to Asian media, Russians have become\r\nincreasingly active in the Far East, mainly in Japan, South\r\nKorea, Taiwan, and mainland China.\r\n\r\nRussia is worried about losing its edge in avionics,\r\nelectronics, information technology and some emerging\r\ndefense industries such as laser shields, positronics,\r\nunmanned vehicles, wearable computing, and real time\r\ntriple C (communication, command and control)\r\ncomputerized battlefield management. The main targets\r\nare, surprisingly, Israel and France. According to media\r\nreports, the substantive clients of Russia's defense\r\nindustry - such as India - insist on hollowing out Russian\r\ncraft and installing Israeli and west European systems\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nRussia's paranoid state of mind extends to its interior.\r\n\r\nUralinformbureau reported earlier in 2002 that the Yamal-\r\nNenets autonomous okrug (district) restricted access to\r\nforeigners citing concerns about industrial espionage and\r\npotential sabotage of oil and gas companies. The Kremlin\r\nmaintains an ever-expanding list of regions and territories\r\nwith limited - or outright - forbidden - access to\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\nThe FSB, the KGB's main successor, is busy arresting\r\nspies all over the vast country. To select a random events\r\nof the dozens reported every year - and many are not - the\r\nRussian daily Kommersant recounted in February 2002\r\nhow when the Trunov works at the Novolipetsk\r\nmetallurgical combine concluded an agreement with a\r\nChinese company to supply it with slabs, its chief\r\nnegotiator was nabbed as a spy working for \"circles in\r\nChina\". His crime? He was in possession of certain\r\ndocuments which contained \"intellectual property\" of the\r\ncrumbling and antiquated mill pertaining to a slab quality\r\nenhancement process.\r\n\r\nForeigners are also being arrested, though rarely. An\r\nAmerican businessman, Edmund Pope, was detained in\r\nApril 2000 for attempting to purchase the blueprints of an\r\nadvanced torpedo from a Russian scientist. There have\r\nbeen a few other isolated apprehensions, mainly for\r\n\"proper\", military, espionage. But Russians bear the brunt\r\nof the campaign against foreign economic intelligence\r\ngathering.\r\n\r\nStrana.ru reported in December 2001 that, speaking on the\r\noccasion of Security Services Day, Putin - himself a KGB\r\nalumnus - warned veterans that the most crucial task\r\nfacing the services today is \"protecting the country's\r\neconomy against industrial espionage\".\r\n\r\nThis is nothing new. According to History of Espionage\r\nWeb site, long before they established diplomatic\r\nrelations with the USA in 1933, the Soviets had Amtorg\r\nTrading Company. Ostensibly its purpose was to\r\nencourage joint ventures between Russian and American\r\nfirms. Really it was a hub of industrial undercover\r\nactivities. Dozens of Soviet intelligence officers\r\nsupervised, at its peak during the Depression, 800\r\nAmerican communists. The Soviet Union's European\r\noperations in Berlin (Handelsvertretung) and in London\r\n(Arcos, Ltd.) were even more successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. The Business of Torture\r\n\r\nAlso Read\r\nThe Argument for Torture\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 16, 2003, the European Court of Human\r\nRights agreed - more than two years after the applications\r\nhave been filed - to hear six cases filed by Chechens\r\nagainst Russia. The claimants accuse the Russian military\r\nof torture and indiscriminate killings. The Court has ruled\r\nin the past against the Russian Federation and awarded\r\nassorted plaintiffs thousands of euros per case in\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nAs awareness of human rights increased, as their\r\ndefinition expanded and as new, often authoritarian\r\npolities, resorted to torture and repression - human rights\r\nadvocates and non-governmental organizations\r\nproliferated. It has become a business in its own right:\r\nlawyers, consultants, psychologists, therapists, law\r\nenforcement agencies, scholars and pundits tirelessly\r\npeddle books, seminars, conferences, therapy sessions for\r\nvictims, court appearances and other services.\r\n\r\nHuman rights activists target mainly countries and\r\nmultinationals.\r\n\r\nIn June 2001, the International Labor Rights Fund filed a\r\nlawsuit on behalf of 11 villagers against the American oil\r\nbehemoth, ExxonMobile, for \"abetting\" abuses in Aceh,\r\nIndonesia. They alleged that the company provided the\r\narmy with equipment for digging mass graves and helped\r\nin the construction of interrogation and torture centers.\r\n\r\nIn November 2002, the law firm of Cohen, Milstein,\r\nHausfeld & Toll joined other American and South African\r\nlaw firms in filing a complaint that \"seeks to hold\r\nbusinesses responsible for aiding and abetting the\r\napartheid regime in South Africa ... forced labor,\r\ngenocide, extrajudicial killing, torture, sexual assault, and\r\nunlawful detention\".\r\n\r\nAmong the accused: \"IBM and ICL which provided the\r\ncomputers that enabled South Africa to ... control the\r\nblack South African population. Car manufacturers\r\nprovided the armored vehicles that were used to patrol the\r\ntownships. Arms manufacturers violated the embargoes\r\non sales to South Africa, as did the oil companies. The\r\nbanks provided the funding that enabled South Africa to\r\nexpand its police and security apparatus\".\r\n\r\nCharges were leveled against Unocal in Myanmar and\r\ndozens of other multinationals. In September 2002, Berger\r\n& Montague filed a class action complaint against Royal\r\nDutch Petroleum and Shell Transport. The oil giants are\r\ncharged with \"purchasing ammunition and using ...\r\nhelicopters and boats and providing logistical support for\r\n'Operation Restore Order in Ogoniland'\" which was\r\ndesigned, according to the law firm, to \"terrorize the\r\ncivilian population into ending peaceful protests against\r\nShell's environmentally unsound oil exploration and\r\nextraction activities\".\r\n\r\nThe defendants in all these court cases strongly deny any\r\nwrongdoing.\r\n\r\nBut this is merely one facet of the torture business.\r\n\r\nTorture implements are produced - mostly in the West -\r\nand sold openly, frequently to nasty regimes in developing\r\ncountries and even through the Internet. Hi-tech devices\r\nabound: sophisticated electroconvulsive stun guns, painful\r\nrestraints, truth serums, chemicals such as pepper gas.\r\n\r\nExport licensing is universally minimal and non-intrusive\r\nand completely ignores the technical specifications of the\r\ngoods (for instance, whether they could be lethal, or\r\nmerely inflict pain).\r\n\r\nAmnesty International and the UK-based Omega\r\nFoundation, found more than 150 manufacturers of stun\r\nguns in the USA alone. They face tough competition from\r\nGermany (30 companies), Taiwan (19), France (14),\r\nSouth Korea (13), China (12), South Africa (nine), Israel\r\n(eight), Mexico (six), Poland (four), Russia (four), Brazil\r\n(three), Spain (three) and the Czech Republic (two).\r\n\r\nMany torture implements pass through \"off-shore\" supply\r\nnetworks in Austria, Canada, Indonesia, Kuwait, Lebanon,\r\nLithuania, Macedonia, Albania, Russia, Israel, the\r\nPhilippines, Romania and Turkey. This helps European\r\nUnion based companies circumvent legal bans at home.\r\n\r\nThe US government has traditionally turned a blind eye to\r\nthe international trading of such gadgets.\r\n\r\nAmerican high-voltage electro-shock stun shields turned\r\nup in Turkey, stun guns in Indonesia, and electro-shock\r\nbatons and shields, and dart-firing taser guns in torture-\r\nprone Saudi Arabia. American firms are the dominant\r\nmanufacturers of stun belts. Explains Dennis Kaufman,\r\nPresident of Stun Tech Inc, a US manufacturer of this\r\ninnovation: ''Electricity speaks every language known to\r\nman. No translation necessary. Everybody is afraid of\r\nelectricity, and rightfully so.'' (Quoted by Amnesty\r\nInternational).\r\n\r\nThe Omega Foundation and Amnesty claim that 49 US\r\ncompanies are also major suppliers of mechanical\r\nrestraints, including leg-irons and thumbcuffs. But they\r\nare not alone. Other suppliers are found in Germany (8),\r\nFrance (5), China (3), Taiwan (3), South Africa (2), Spain\r\n(2), the UK (2) and South Korea (1).\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the Commerce Department doesn't keep\r\ntab on this category of exports.\r\n\r\nNor is the money sloshing around negligible. Records\r\nkept under the export control commodity number A985\r\nshow that Saudi Arabia alone spent in the United States\r\nmore than $1 million a year between 1997-2000 merely\r\non stun guns. Venezuela's bill for shock batons and such\r\nreached $3.7 million in the same period. Other clients\r\nincluded Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mexico and - surprisingly -\r\nBulgaria. Egypt's notoriously brutal services - already\r\nwell-equipped - spent a mere $40,000.\r\n\r\nThe United States is not the only culprit. The European\r\nCommission, according to an Amnesty International\r\nreport titled \"Stopping the Torture Trade\" and published\r\nin 2001:\r\n\"Gave a quality award to a Taiwanese electro-shock\r\nbaton, but when challenged could not cite evidence as to\r\nindependent safety tests for such a baton or whether\r\nmember states of the European Union (EU) had been\r\nconsulted. Most EU states have banned the use of such\r\nweapons at home, but French and German companies are\r\nstill allowed to supply them to other countries\".\r\n\r\nTorture expertise is widely proffered by former soldiers,\r\nagents of the security services made redundant, retired\r\npolicemen and even rogue medical doctors. China, Israel,\r\nSouth Africa, France, Russia, the United kingdom and the\r\nUnited States are founts of such useful knowledge and its\r\npropagators.\r\n\r\nHow rooted torture is was revealed in September 1996\r\nwhen the US Department of Defense admitted that\r\n''intelligence training manuals'' were used in the Federally\r\nsponsored School of the Americas - one of 150 such\r\nfacilities - between 1982 and 1991.The manuals, written\r\nin Spanish and used to train thousands of Latin American\r\nsecurity agents, \"advocated execution, torture, beatings\r\nand blackmail\", says Amnesty International.\r\n\r\nWhere there is demand there is supply. Rather than ignore\r\nthe discomfiting subject, governments would do well to\r\nlegalize and supervise it. Alan Dershowitz, a prominent\r\nAmerican criminal defense attorney, proposed, in an op-\r\ned article in the Los Angeles Times, published November\r\n8, 2001, to legalize torture in extreme cases and to have\r\njudges issue \"torture warrants\". This may be a radical\r\ndeparture from the human rights tradition of the civilized\r\nworld. But dispensing export carefully reviewed licenses\r\nfor dual-use implements is a different matter altogether -\r\nand long overdue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.  The Criminality of Transition\r\n\r\nLecture given at the Netherlands Economic\r\nInstitute (NEI) on 18/4/2001\r\n\r\n\r\nHuman vice is the most certain thing after death and taxes,\r\nto paraphrase Benjamin Franklin. The only variety of\r\neconomic activity, which will surely survive even a\r\nnuclear holocaust, is bound to be crime. Prostitution,\r\ngambling, drugs and, in general, expressly illegal\r\nactivities generate c. 400 billion USD annually to their\r\nperpetrators, thus making crime the third biggest industry\r\non Earth (after the medical and pharmaceutical\r\nindustries).\r\n\r\nMany of the so called Economies in Transition and of\r\nHPICs (Highly Indebted Poor Countries) do resemble\r\npost-nuclear-holocaust ashes. GDPs in most of these\r\neconomies either tumbled nominally or in real terms by\r\nmore than 60% in the space of less than a decade. The\r\naverage monthly salary is the equivalent of the average\r\ndaily salary of the German industrial worker. The GDP\r\nper capita - with very few notable exceptions - is around\r\n20% of the EU's average and the average wages are 14%\r\nthe EU's average (2000). These are the telltale overt signs\r\nof a comprehensive collapse of the infrastructure and of\r\nthe export and internal markets. Mountains of internal\r\ndebt, sky high interest rates, cronyism, other forms of\r\ncorruption, environmental, urban and rural dilapidation -\r\ncharacterize these economies.\r\n\r\nInto this vacuum - the interregnum between centrally\r\nplanned and free market economies - crept crime. In most\r\nof these countries criminals run at least half the economy,\r\nare part of the governing elites (influencing them behind\r\nthe scenes through money contributions, outright bribes,\r\nor blackmail) and - through the mechanism of money\r\nlaundering - infiltrate slowly the legitimate economy.\r\n\r\nWhat gives crime the edge, the competitive advantage\r\nversus the older, ostensibly more well established elites?\r\nThe free market does. When communism collapsed, only\r\ncriminals, politicians, managers, and employees of the\r\nsecurity services were positioned to benefit from the\r\nupheaval. Criminals, for instance, are much better\r\nequipped to deal with the onslaught of this new\r\nconceptual beast, the mechanism of the market, than most\r\nother economic players in these tattered economies are.\r\n\r\nCriminals, by the very nature of their vocation, were\r\nalways private entrepreneurs. They were never state\r\nowned or subjected to any kind of central planning. Thus,\r\nthey became the only group in society that was not\r\ncorrupted by these un-natural inventions. They invested\r\ntheir own capital in small to medium size enterprises and\r\nran them later as any American manager would have\r\ndone. To a large extent the criminals, single handedly,\r\ncreated a private sector in these derelict economies.\r\n\r\nHaving established a private sector business, devoid of\r\nany involvement of the state, the criminal-entrepreneurs\r\nproceeded to study the market. Through primitive forms\r\nof market research (neighbourhood activists) they were\r\nable to identify the needs of their prospective customers,\r\nto monitor them in real time and to respond with agility to\r\nchanges in the patterns of supply and demand. Criminals\r\nare market-animals and they are geared to respond to its\r\ngyrations and vicissitudes. Though they were not likely to\r\nengage in conventional marketing and advertising, they\r\nalways stayed attuned to the market's vibrations and\r\nsignals. They changed their product mix and their pricing\r\nto fit fluctuations in demand and supply.\r\n\r\nCriminals have proven to be good organizers and\r\nmanagers. They have very effective ways of enforcing\r\ndiscipline in the workplace, of setting revenue targets, of\r\nmaintaining a flexible hierarchy combined with rigid\r\nobeisance - with very high upward mobility and a clear\r\ncareer path. A complex system of incentives and\r\ndisincentives drives the workforce to dedication and\r\nindustriousness. The criminal rings are well run\r\nconglomerates and the more classic industries would have\r\ndone well to study their modes of organization and\r\nmanagement. Everything - from sales through territorially\r\nexclusive licences (franchises) to effective \"stock\" options\r\n- has been invented in the international crime\r\norganizations long before it acquired the respectability of\r\nthe corporate boardroom.\r\n\r\nThe criminal world has replicated those parts of the state\r\nwhich were rendered ineffective by unrealistic ideology or\r\nby pure corruption. The court system makes a fine\r\nexample. The criminals instituted their own code of\r\njustice (\"law\") and their own court system. A unique -\r\nand often irreversible - enforcement arm sees to it that\r\nrespect towards these indispensable institutions is\r\nmaintained. Effective - often interactive - legislation, an\r\nefficient court system, backed by ominous and ruthless\r\nagents of enforcement - ensure the friction-free\r\nfunctioning of the giant wheels of crime. Crime has\r\nreplicated numerous other state institutions. Small wonder\r\nthat when the state disintegrated - crime was able to\r\nreplace it with little difficulty. The same pattern is\r\ndiscernible in certain parts of the world where terrorist\r\norganizations duplicate the state and overtake it, in time.\r\n\r\nSchools, clinics, legal assistance, family support, taxation,\r\nthe court system, transportation and telecommunication\r\nservices, banking and industry - all have a criminal\r\ndoppelganger.\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\nAt the outset of transition, the underworld constituted an\r\nembryonic private sector, replete with international\r\nnetworks of contacts, cross-border experience, capital\r\nagglomeration and wealth formation, sources of venture\r\n(risk) capital, an entrepreneurial spirit, and a diversified\r\nportfolio of investments, revenue generating assets, and\r\nsources of wealth. Criminals were used to private sector\r\npractices: price signals, competition, joint venturing, and\r\nthird party dispute settlement.\r\n\r\nTo secure this remarkable achievement - the underworld\r\nhad to procure and then maintain - infrastructure and\r\ntechnologies. Indeed, criminals are great at innovating and\r\neven more formidable at making use of cutting edge\r\ntechnologies. There is not a single technological advance,\r\ninvention or discovery that criminals were not the first to\r\nutilize or the first to contemplate and to grasp its full\r\npotential. There are enormous industries of services\r\nrendered to the criminal in his pursuits. Accountants and\r\nlawyers, forgers and cross border guides, weapons experts\r\nand bankers, mechanics and hit-men - all stand at the\r\ndisposal of the average criminal. The choice is great and\r\nprices are always negotiable. These auxiliary\r\nprofessionals are no different to their legitimate\r\ncounterparts, despite the difference in subject matter. A\r\nbody of expertise, know-how and acumen has\r\naccumulated over centuries of crime and is handed down\r\nthe generations in the criminal universities known as jail-\r\nhouses and penitentiaries. Roads less travelled, countries\r\nmore lenient, passports to be bought, sold, or forged, how\r\nto manuals, classified ads, goods and services on offer and\r\ndemand - all feature in this mass media cum educational\r\n(mostly verbal) bulletins. This is the real infrastructure of\r\ncrime. As with more mundane occupations, human capital\r\nis what counts.\r\n\r\nCriminal activities are hugely profitable (though wealth\r\naccumulation and capital distribution are grossly non-\r\negalitarian). Money is stashed away in banking havens\r\nand in more regular banks and financial institutions all\r\nover the globe. Electronic Document Interchange and\r\nelectronic commerce transformed what used to be an\r\ninconveniently slow and painfully transparent process -\r\ninto a speed-of-light here-I-am, here-I-am-gone type of\r\noperation. Money is easily movable and virtually\r\nuntraceable. Special experts take care of that: tax havens,\r\noff shore banks, money transactions couriers with the\r\nright education and a free spirit. This money, in due time\r\nand having cooled off - is reinvested in legitimate\r\nactivities. Crime is a major engine of economic growth in\r\nsome countries (where drugs are grown or traded, or in\r\ncountries such as Italy, in Russia and elsewhere in CEE).\r\n\r\nIn many a place, criminals are the only ones who have any\r\nliquidity at all. The other, more visible, sectors of the\r\neconomy are wallowing in the financial drought of a\r\ndemonetized economy. People and governments tend to\r\nlose both their scruples and their sense of fine distinctions\r\nunder these unhappy circumstances. They welcome any\r\nkind of money to ensure their very survival. This is where\r\ncrime comes in. In Central and Eastern Europe the process\r\nwas code-named: \"privatization\".\r\n\r\nMoreover, most of the poor economies are also closed\r\neconomies. They are the economies of nations\r\nxenophobic, closed to the outside world, with currency\r\nregulations, limitations on foreign ownership, constrained\r\n(instead of free) trade. The vast majority of the populace\r\nof these economic wretches has never been further than\r\nthe neighbouring city - let alone outside the borders of\r\ntheir countries. Freedom of movement is still restricted.\r\n\r\nThe only ones to have travelled freely - mostly without\r\nthe required travel documents - were the criminals. Crime\r\nis international. It involves massive, intricate and\r\nsophisticated operations of export and import, knowledge\r\nof languages, extensive and frequent trips, an intimate\r\nacquaintance with world prices, the international financial\r\nsystem, demand and supply in various markets, frequent\r\nbusiness negotiations with foreigners and so on. This list\r\nwould fit any modern businessman as well. Criminals are\r\ninternational businessmen. Their connections abroad\r\ncoupled with their connections with the various elites\r\ninside their country and coupled with their financial\r\nprowess - made them the first and only true businessmen\r\nof the economies in transition. There simply was no one\r\nelse qualified to fulfil this role - and the criminals stepped\r\nin willingly.\r\n\r\nThey planned and timed their moves as they always do:\r\nwith shrewdness, an uncanny knowledge of human\r\npsychology and relentless cruelty. There was no one to\r\noppose them - and so they won the day. It will take one or\r\nmore generations to get rid of them and to replace them by\r\na more civilized breed of entrepreneurs. But it will not\r\nhappen overnight.\r\n\r\nIn the 19th century, the then expanding USA went through\r\nthe same process. Robber barons seized economic\r\nopportunities in the Wild East and in the Wild West and\r\nreally everywhere else. Morgan, Rockefeller, Pullman,\r\nVanderbilt - the most ennobled families of latter day\r\nAmerica originated with these rascals. But there is one\r\nimportant difference between the USA at that time and\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe today. A civic culture with\r\ncivic values and an aspiration to, ultimately, create a civic\r\nsociety permeated the popular as well as the high-brow\r\nculture of America. Criminality was regarded as a\r\nshameful stepping stone on the way to an orderly society\r\nof learned, civilized, law-abiding citizens. This cannot be\r\nsaid about Russia, for instance. The criminal there is, if\r\nanything, admired and emulated. The language of\r\nbusiness in countries in transition is suffused with the\r\ncriminal parlance of violence. The next generation is\r\nencouraged to behave similarly because no clear (not to\r\nmention well embedded) alternative is propounded. There\r\nis no - and never was - a civic tradition in these countries,\r\na Bill of Rights, a veritable Constitution, a modicum of\r\nself rule, a true abolition of classes and nomenclatures.\r\n\r\nThe future is grim because the past was grim. Used to\r\nbeing governed by capricious, paranoiac, criminal tyrants\r\n- these nations know no better. The current criminal class\r\nseems to them to be a natural continuation and extension\r\nof generations-long trends. That some criminals are\r\nmembers of the new political, financial and industrial\r\nelites (and vice versa) - surprises them not.\r\n\r\nIn most countries in transition, the elites (the political-\r\nmanagerial complex) make use of the state and its\r\nsimulacrum institutions in close symbiosis with the\r\ncriminal underworld. The state is often an oppressive\r\nmechanism deployed in order to control the populace and\r\nmanipulate it. Politicians allocate assets, resources, rights,\r\nand licences to themselves, and to their families and\r\ncronies. Patronage extends to collaborating criminals.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the sovereign state is regarded as a means to\r\nextract foreign aid and credits from donors, multilaterals,\r\nand NGOs.\r\n\r\nThe criminal underworld exploits the politicians.\r\n\r\nPoliticians give criminals access to state owned assets and\r\nresources. These are an integral part of the money\r\nlaundering cycle. \"Dirty\" money is legitimized through\r\nthe purchase of businesses and real estate from the state.\r\n\r\nPoliticians induce state institutions to turn a blind eye to\r\nthe criminal activities of their collaborators and ensure\r\nlenient law enforcement. They also help criminals\r\neliminate internal and external competition in their\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nIn return, criminals serve as the \"long and anonymous\r\narm\" of politicians. They obtain illicit goods for them and\r\nprovide them with illegal services. Corruption often flows\r\nthrough criminal channels or via the mediation and\r\nconduit of delinquents. Within the shared sphere of the\r\ninformal economy, assets are often shifted among these\r\neconomic players. Both have an interest to maintain a\r\ncertain lack of transparency, a bureaucracy (=dependence\r\non state institutions and state employees) and NAIRU\r\n(Non Abating Internal Recruitment Unemployment).\r\n\r\nNationalism and racism, the fostering of paranoia and\r\ngrievances are excellent tactics of mobilization of foot\r\nsoldiers. And the needs to dispense with a continuous\r\nstream of patronage and provide venues for the\r\nlegitimization of illegally earned funds delay essential\r\nreforms and the disposal of state assets.\r\n\r\nThis urge to become legitimate - largely the result of\r\nsocial pressure - leads to a deterministic, four stroke cycle\r\nof co-habitation between politicians and criminals. In the\r\nfirst phase, politicians grope for a new ideological cover\r\nfor their opportunism. This is followed by a growing\r\npartnership between the elites and the crime world. A\r\ndivergence then occurs. Politicians team up with\r\nlegitimacy-seeking, established crime lords. Both groups\r\nbenefit from a larger economic pie. They fight against\r\nother, less successful, criminals, who wish to persist in\r\ntheir old ways. This is low intensity warfare and it\r\ninevitably ends in the triumph of the former over the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. The Economics of Conspiracy Theories\r\n\r\n\r\nBarry Chamish is convinced that Shimon Peres, Israel's\r\nwily old statesman, ordered the assassination of Yitzhak\r\nRabin, back in 1995, in collaboration with the French. He\r\npoints to apparent tampering with evidence. The blood-\r\nstained song sheet in Mr. Rabin's pocket lost its bullet\r\nhole between the night of the murder and the present.\r\n\r\nThe murderer, Yigal Amir, should have been immediately\r\nrecognized by Rabin's bodyguards. He has publicly\r\nattacked his query before. Israel's fierce and fearsome\r\ninternal security service, the Shabak, had moles and\r\nagents provocateurs among the plotters. Chamish\r\npublished a book about the affair. He travels and lectures\r\nwidely, presumably for a fee.\r\n\r\nChamish's paranoia-larded prose is not unique. The\r\ntranscripts of Senator Joseph McCarthy's inquisitions are\r\nno less outlandish. But it was the murder of John F.\r\n\r\nKennedy, America's youthful president, that ushered in a\r\ngolden age of conspiracy theories.\r\n\r\nThe distrust of appearances and official versions was\r\nfurther enhanced by the Watergate scandal in 1973-4.\r\n\r\nConspiracies and urban legends offer meaning and\r\npurposefulness in a capricious, kaleidoscopic,\r\nmaddeningly ambiguous, and cruel world. They empower\r\ntheir otherwise helpless and terrified believers.\r\n\r\nNew Order one world government, Zionist and Jewish\r\ncabals, Catholic, black, yellow, or red subversion, the\r\nmachinations attributed to the freemasons and the\r\nilluminati - all flourished yet again from the 1970's\r\nonwards. Paranoid speculations reached frenzied nadirs\r\nfollowing the deaths of celebrities, such as \"Princess Di\".\r\n\r\nBooks like \"The Da Vinci Code\" (which deals with an\r\nimprobable Catholic conspiracy to erase from history the\r\ntrue facts about the fate of Jesus) sell millions of copies\r\nworldwide.\r\n\r\nTony Blair, Britain's ever righteous prime minister\r\ndenounced the \"Diana Death Industry\". He was referring\r\nto the tomes and films which exploited the wild rumors\r\nsurrounding the fatal car crash in Paris in 1997. The\r\nPrincess, her boyfriend Dodi al-Fayed, heir to a fortune,\r\nas well as their allegedly inebriated driver were killed in\r\nthe accident.\r\n\r\nAmong the exploiters were \"The Times\" of London which\r\npromptly published a serialized book by Time magazine\r\nreports. Britain's TV networks, led by Live TV,\r\ncapitalized on comments made by al-Fayed's father to the\r\n\"Mirror\" alleging foul play.\r\n\r\nBut there is more to conspiracy theories than mass\r\npsychology. It is also big business. Voluntary associations\r\nsuch as the Ku Klux Klan and the John Birch Society are\r\npast their heyday. But they still gross many millions of\r\ndollars a year.\r\n\r\nThe monthly \"Fortean Times\" is the leading brand in\r\n\"strange phenomena and experiences, curiosities,\r\nprodigies and portents\". It is widely available on both\r\nsides of the Atlantic. In its 29 years of existence it has\r\ncovered the bizarre, the macabre, and the ominous with\r\npanache and open-mindedness.\r\n\r\nIt is named after Charles Fort who compiled unexplained\r\nmysteries from the scientific literature of his age (he died\r\nin 1932). He published four bestsellers in his lifetime and\r\nlived to see \"Fortean societies\" established in many\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nA 12 months subscription to \"Fortean Times\" costs c. $45.\r\n\r\nWith a circulation of  60,000, the magazine was able to\r\nspin off \"Fortean Television\" - a TV show on Britain's\r\nChannel Four. Its reputation was further enhanced when it\r\nwas credited with inspiring the TV hit series X-Files and\r\nThe Sixth Sense.\r\n\"Lobster Magazine\" - a bi-annual publication - is more\r\nmodest at $15 a year. It is far more \"academic\" looking\r\nand it sells CD ROM compilations of its articles at\r\nbetween $80 (for individuals) and $160 (for institutions\r\nand organizations) a piece. It also makes back copies of its\r\nissues available.\r\n\r\nIts editor, Robin Ramsay, said in a lecture delivered to the\r\n\"Unconvention 96\", organized by the \"Fortean Times\":\r\n\"Conspiracy theories certainly are sexy at the moment ...\r\n\r\nI've been contacted by five or six TV companies in the\r\npast six months - two last week - all interested in making\r\nprogrammes about conspiracy theories. I even got a call\r\nfrom the Big Breakfast Show, from a researcher who had\r\nno idea who I was, asking me if I'd like to appear on it ...\r\n\r\nThese days we've got conspiracy theories everywhere; and\r\nabout almost everything\".\r\n\r\nBut these two publications are the tip of a gigantic and\r\never-growing iceberg. \"Fortean Times\" reviews, month in\r\nand month out, books, PC games, movies, and software\r\nconcerned with its subject matter. There is an average of 8\r\nitems per issue with a median price of $20 per item.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 186,600 Web sites dedicated to\r\nconspiracy theories in Google's database of 3 billion\r\npages. The \"conspiracy theories\" category in the Open\r\nDirectory Project, a Web directory edited by volunteers,\r\ncontains hundreds of entries.\r\n\r\nThere are 1077 titles about conspiracies listed in Amazon\r\nand another 12078 in its individually-operated ZShops. A\r\nnew (1996) edition of the century-old anti-Semitic\r\npropaganda pamphlet faked by the Czarist secret service,\r\n\"Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\", is available\r\nthrough Amazon. Its sales rank is a respectable 64,000 -\r\nout of more than 2 million titles stocked by the online\r\nbookseller.\r\n\r\nIn a disclaimer, Amazon states:\r\n\"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion is classified\r\nunder \"controversial knowledge\" in our store, along with\r\nbooks about UFOs, demonic possession, and all manner\r\nof conspiracy theories\".\r\n\r\nYet, cinema and TV did more to propagate modern\r\nnightmares than all the books combined. The Internet is\r\nstarting to have a similar impact compounded by its\r\nnetworking capabilities and by its environment of\r\nsimulated reality - \"cyberspace\". In his tome, \"Enemies\r\nWithin: The Culture of Conspiracy in Modern America\",\r\nRobert Alan Goldberg comes close to regarding the\r\nparanoid mode of thinking as a manifestation of\r\nmainstream American culture.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Internet Movie Database, the first 50 all\r\ntime hits include at least one \"straight\" conspiracy theory\r\nmovie (in the 13th place) - \"Men in Black\" with $587\r\nmillion in box office receipts. JFK (in the 193rd place)\r\ngrossed another $205 million. At least ten other films\r\namong the first 50 revolve around a conspiracy theory\r\ndisguised as science fiction or fantasy. \"The Matrix\" - in\r\nthe 28th place - took in $456 million. \"The Fugitive\"\r\ncloses the list with $357 million. This is not counting\r\n\"serial\" movies such as James Bond, the reification of\r\nparanoia shaken and stirred.\r\n\r\nX-files is to television what \"Men in Black\" is to cinema.\r\n\r\nAccording to \"Advertising Age\", at its peak, in 1998, a 30\r\nseconds spot on the show cost $330,000 and each chapter\r\nraked in $5 million in ad revenues. Ad prices declined to\r\n$225,000 per spot two years later, according to CMR\r\nBusiness to Business.\r\n\r\nStill, in its January 1998 issue, \"Fortune\" claimed that \"X-\r\nFiles\" (by then a five year old phenomenon) garnered Fox\r\nTV well over half a billion dollars in revenues. This was\r\nbefore the eponymous feature film was released. Even at\r\nthe end of 2000, the show was regularly being watched by\r\n12.4 million households - compared to 22.7 million\r\nviewers in 1998. But X-files was only the latest, and the\r\nmost successful, of a line of similar TV shows, notably\r\n\"The Prisoner\" in the 1960's.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to tell how many people feed off the\r\nparanoid frenzy of the lunatic fringe. I found more than\r\n3000 lecturers on these subjects listed by the Google\r\nsearch engine alone. Even assuming a conservative\r\nschedule of one lecture a month with a modest fee of $250\r\nper appearance - we are talking about an industry of c.\r\n$10 million.\r\n\r\nCollective paranoia has been boosted by the Internet.\r\n\r\nConsider the computer game \"Majestic\" by Electronic\r\nArts. It is an interactive and immersive game, suffused\r\nwith the penumbral  and the surreal. It is a Web\r\nreincarnation of the borderlands and the twilight zone -\r\ncentered around a nefarious and lethal government\r\nconspiracy. It invades the players' reality - the game\r\nleaves them mysterious messages and \"tips\" by phone,\r\nfax, instant messaging, and e-mail. A typical round lasts 6\r\nmonths and costs $10 a month.\r\n\r\nNeil Young, the game's 31-years old, British-born,\r\nproducer told Salon.com recently:\r\n\"... The concept of blurring the lines between fact and\r\nfiction, specifically around conspiracies. I found myself\r\non a Web site for the conspiracy theory radio show by Art\r\nBell ... the Internet is such a fabulous medium to blur\r\nthose lines between fact and fiction and conspiracy,\r\nbecause you begin to make connections between things.\r\n\r\nIt's a natural human reaction - we connect these dots\r\naround our fears. Especially on the Internet, which is so\r\nconspiracy-friendly. That was what was so interesting\r\nabout the game; you couldn't tell whether the sites you\r\nwere visiting were Majestic-created or normal Web\r\nsites..\".\r\n\r\nMajestic creates almost 30 primary Web sites per episode.\r\n\r\nIt has dozens of \"bio\" sites and hundreds of Web sites\r\ncreated by fans and linked to the main conspiracy threads.\r\n\r\nThe imaginary gaming firm at the core of its plots,\r\n\"Amin-X\", has often been confused with the real thing. It\r\neven won the E3 Critics Award for best original product...\r\n\r\nConspiracy theories have pervaded every facet of our\r\nmodern life. A.H. Barbee describes in \"Making Money\r\nthe Telefunding Way\" (published on the Web site of the\r\nInstitute for First Amendment Studies) how conspiracy\r\ntheorists make use of non-profit \"para-churches\".\r\n\r\nThey deploy television, radio, and direct mail to raise\r\nbillions of dollars from their followers through\r\n\"telefunding\". Under section 170 of the IRS code, they are\r\ntax-exempt and not obliged even to report their income.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Trade commission estimates that 10% of the\r\n$143 billion donated to charity each year may be solicited\r\nfraudulently.\r\n\r\nLawyers represent victims of the Gulf Syndrome for hefty\r\nsums. Agencies in the USA debug bodies - they \"remove\"\r\nbrain  \"implants\" clandestinely placed by the CIA during\r\nthe Cold War. They charge thousands of dollars a pop.\r\n\r\nCranks and whackos - many of them religious\r\nfundamentalists - use inexpensive desktop publishing\r\ntechnology to issue scaremongering newsletters\r\n(remember Mel Gibson in the movie \"Conspiracy\r\nTheory\"?).\r\n\r\nTabloids and talk shows - the only source of information\r\nfor nine tenths of the American population - propagate\r\nthese \"news\". Museums - the UFO museum in New\r\nMexico or the Kennedy Assassination museum in Dallas,\r\nfor instance - immortalize them. Memorabilia are sold\r\nthrough auction sites and auction houses for thousands of\r\ndollars an item.\r\n\r\nNumerous products were adversely affected by\r\nconspiratorial smear campaigns. In his book \"How the\r\nParanoid Style Flourishes and Where it Comes From\",\r\nDaniel Pipes describes how the sales of Tropical Fantasy\r\nplummeted by 70% following widely circulated rumors\r\nabout the sterilizing substances it allegedly contained -\r\nput there by the KKK. Other brands suffered a similar\r\nfate: Kool and Uptown cigarettes, Troop Sport clothing,\r\nChurch's Fried Chicken, and Snapple soft drinks.\r\n\r\nIt all looks like one giant conspiracy to me. Now, here's\r\none theory worth pondering...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. The Demise of the Work Ethic\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"When work is a pleasure, life is a joy!\r\n     When work is a duty, life is slavery\".\r\n\r\nMaxim Gorky (1868-1936), Russian novelist, author,\r\nand playright\r\n\r\n\r\nAirplanes, missiles, and space shuttles crash due to lack of\r\nmaintenance, absent-mindedness, and pure ignorance.\r\n\r\nSoftware support personnel, aided and abetted by\r\nCustomer Relationship Management application suites,\r\nare curt (when reachable) and unhelpful. Despite\r\nexpensive, state of the art supply chain management\r\nsystems, retailers, suppliers, and manufacturers habitually\r\nrun out of stocks of finished and semi-finished products\r\nand raw materials. People from all walks of life and at all\r\nlevels of the corporate ladder skirt their responsibilities\r\nand neglect their duties.\r\n\r\nWhatever happened to the work ethic? Where is the pride\r\nin the immaculate quality of one's labor and produce?\r\nBoth dead in the water. A series of earth-shattering social,\r\neconomic, and technological trends converged to render\r\ntheir jobs loathsome to many - a tedious nuisance best\r\navoided.\r\n1. Job security is a thing of the past. Itinerancy in various\r\nMcJobs reduces the incentive to invest time, effort, and\r\nresources into a position that may not be yours next week.\r\n\r\nBrutal layoffs and downsizing traumatized the workforce\r\nand produced in the typical workplace a culture of\r\nobsequiousness, blind obeisance, the suppression of\r\nindependent thought and speech, and avoidance of\r\ninitiative and innovation. Many offices and shop floors\r\nnow resemble prisons.\r\n2. Outsourcing and offshoring of back office (and, more\r\nrecently, customer relations and research and\r\ndevelopment) functions sharply and adversely effected the\r\nquality of services from helpdesks to airline ticketing and\r\nfrom insurance claims processing to remote maintenance.\r\n\r\nCultural mismatches between the (typically Western)\r\nclient base and the offshore service department (usually in\r\na developing country where labor is cheap and plenty)\r\nonly exacerbated the breakdown of trust between\r\ncustomer and provider or supplier.\r\n3. The populace in developed countries are addicted to\r\nleisure time. Most people regard their jobs as a necessary\r\nevil, best avoided whenever possible. Hence phenomena\r\nlike the permanent temp - employees who prefer a\r\nsuccession of temporary assignments to holding a proper\r\njob. The media and the arts contribute to this perception of\r\nwork as a drag - or a potentially dangerous addiction\r\n(when they portray raging and abusive workaholics).\r\n4. The other side of this dismal coin is workaholism - the\r\naddiction to work. Far from valuing it, these addicts resent\r\ntheir dependence. The job performance of the typical\r\nworkaholic leaves a lot to be desired. Workaholics are\r\nfatigued, suffer from ancillary addictions, and short\r\nattention spans. They frequently abuse substances, are\r\nnarcissistic and destructively competitive (being driven,\r\nthey are incapable of team work).\r\n5. The depersonalization of manufacturing - the\r\nintermediated divorce between the artisan/worker and his\r\nclient - contributed a lot to the indifference and alienation\r\nof the common industrial worker, the veritable\r\n\"anonymous cog in the machine\".\r\n\r\nNot only was the link between worker and product broken\r\n- but the bond between artisan and client was severed as\r\nwell. Few employees know their customers or patrons first\r\nhand. It is hard to empathize with and care about a\r\nstatistic, a buyer whom you have never met and never\r\nlikely to encounter. It is easy in such circumstances to feel\r\nimmune to the consequences of one's negligence and\r\napathy at work. It is impossible to be proud of what you\r\ndo and to be committed to your work - if you never set\r\neyes on either the final product or the customer! Charlie\r\nChaplin's masterpiece, \"Modern Times\" captured this\r\nestrangement brilliantly.\r\n6. Many former employees of mega-corporations abandon\r\nthe rat race and establish their own businesses - small and\r\nhome enterprises. Undercapitalized, understaffed, and\r\noutperformed by the competition, these fledging and\r\namateurish outfits usually spew out shoddy products and\r\nlamentable services - only to expire within the first year of\r\nbusiness.\r\n7. Despite decades of advanced notice, globalization\r\ncaught most firms the world over by utter surprise. Ill-\r\nprepared and fearful of the onslaught of foreign\r\ncompetition, companies big and small grapple with\r\nlogistical nightmares, supply chain calamities, culture\r\nshocks and conflicts, and rapacious competitors. Mere\r\nsurvival (and opportunistic managerial plunder) replaced\r\nclient satisfaction as the prime value.\r\n8. The decline of the professional guilds on the one hand\r\nand the trade unions on the other hand greatly reduced\r\nworker self-discipline, pride, and peer-regulated quality\r\ncontrol. Quality is monitored by third parties or\r\ncompromised by being subjected to Procrustean financial\r\nconstraints and concerns.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of malpractice and its punishment are\r\nnow at the hand of vast and ill-informed bureaucracies,\r\neither corporate or governmental. Once malpractice is\r\nexposed and admitted to, the availability of malpractice\r\ninsurance renders most sanctions unnecessary or toothless.\r\n\r\nCorporations prefer to bury mishaps and malfeasance\r\nrather than cope with and rectify them.\r\n9. The quality of one's work, and of services and products\r\none consumed, used to be guaranteed. One's personal\r\nidiosyncrasies, eccentricities, and problems were left at\r\nhome. Work was sacred and one's sense of self-worth\r\ndepended on the satisfaction of one's clients. You simply\r\ndidn't let your personal life affect the standards of your\r\noutput.\r\n\r\nThis strict and useful separation vanished with the rise of\r\nthe malignant-narcissistic variant of individualism. It led\r\nto the emergence of idiosyncratic and fragmented\r\nstandards of quality. No one knows what to expect, when,\r\nand from whom. Transacting business has become a form\r\nof psychological warfare. The customer has to rely on the\r\ngoodwill of suppliers, manufacturers, and service\r\nproviders - and often finds himself at their whim and\r\nmercy. \"The client is always right\" has gone the way of\r\nthe dodo. \"It's my (the supplier's or provider's) way or the\r\nhighway\" rules supreme.\r\n\r\nThis uncertainty is further exacerbated by the pandemic\r\neruption of mental health disorders - 15% of the\r\npopulation are severely pathologized according to the\r\nlatest studies. Antisocial behaviors - from outright crime\r\nto pernicious passive-aggressive sabotage - once rare in\r\nthe workplace, are now abundant.\r\n\r\nThe ethos of teamwork, tempered collectivism, and\r\ncollaboration for the greater good is now derided or\r\ndecried. Conflict on all levels has replaced negotiated\r\ncompromise and has become the prevailing narrative.\r\n\r\nLitigiousness, vigilante justice, use of force, and \"getting\r\naway with it\" are now extolled. Yet, conflicts lead to the\r\nmisallocation of economic resources. They are non-\r\nproductive and not conducive to sustaining good relations\r\nbetween producer or provider and consumer.\r\n10. Moral relativism is the mirror image of rampant\r\nindividualism. Social cohesion and discipline diminished,\r\nideologies and religions crumbled, and anomic states\r\nsubstituted for societal order. The implicit contracts\r\nbetween manufacturer or service provider and customer\r\nand between employee and employer were shredded and\r\nreplaced with ad-hoc negotiated operational checklists.\r\n\r\nSocial decoherence is further enhanced by the\r\nanonymization and depersonalization of the modern chain\r\nof production (see point 5 above).\r\n\r\nNowadays, people facilely and callously abrogate their\r\nresponsibilities towards their families, communities, and\r\nnations. The mushrooming rate of divorce, the decline in\r\npersonal thrift, the skyrocketing number of personal\r\nbankruptcies, and the ubiquity of venality and corruption\r\nboth corporate and political are examples of such\r\ndissipation. No one seems to care about anything. Why\r\nshould the client or employer expect a different treatment?\r\n11. The disintegration of the educational systems of the\r\nWest made it difficult for employers to find qualified and\r\nmotivated personnel. Courtesy, competence, ambition,\r\npersonal responsibility, the ability to see the bigger picture\r\n(synoptic view), interpersonal aptitude, analytic and\r\nsynthetic skills, not to mention numeracy, literacy, access\r\nto technology, and the sense of belonging which they\r\nfoster - are all products of proper schooling.\r\n12. Irrational beliefs, pseudo-sciences, and the occult\r\nrushed in to profitably fill the vacuum left by the\r\ncrumbling education systems. These wasteful\r\npreoccupations encourage in their followers an\r\noverpowering sense of fatalistic determinism and hinder\r\ntheir ability to exercise judgment and initiative. The\r\ndiscourse of commerce and finance relies on unmitigated\r\nrationality and is, in essence, contractual. Irrationality is\r\ndetrimental to the successful and happy exchange of\r\ngoods and services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. The Morality of Child Labor\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the comfort of their plush offices and five to six\r\nfigure salaries, self-appointed NGO's often denounce\r\nchild labor as their employees rush from one five star\r\nhotel to another, $3000 subnotebooks and PDA's in hand.\r\n\r\nThe hairsplitting distinction made by the ILO between\r\n\"child work\" and \"child labor\" conveniently targets\r\nimpoverished countries while letting its budget\r\ncontributors - the developed ones - off-the-hook.\r\n\r\nReports regarding child labor surface periodically.\r\n\r\nChildren crawling in mines, faces ashen, body deformed.\r\n\r\nThe agile fingers of famished infants weaving soccer balls\r\nfor their more privileged counterparts in the USA. Tiny\r\nfigures huddled in sweatshops, toiling in unspeakable\r\nconditions. It is all heart-rending and it gave rise to a\r\nveritable not-so-cottage industry of activists,\r\ncommentators, legal eagles, scholars, and\r\nopportunistically sympathetic politicians.\r\n\r\nAsk the denizens of Thailand, sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil,\r\nor Morocco and they will tell you how they regard this\r\naltruistic hyperactivity - with suspicion and resentment.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the compelling arguments lurks an agenda of\r\ntrade protectionism, they wholeheartedly believe.\r\n\r\nStringent - and expensive - labor and environmental\r\nprovisions in international treaties may well be a ploy to\r\nfend off imports based on cheap labor and the competition\r\nthey wreak on well-ensconced domestic industries and\r\ntheir political stooges.\r\n\r\nThis is especially galling since the sanctimonious West\r\nhas amassed its wealth on the broken backs of slaves and\r\nkids. The 1900 census in the USA found that 18 percent\r\nof all children - almost two million in all - were gainfully\r\nemployed. The Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional laws\r\nbanning child labor as late as 1916. This decision was\r\noverturned only in 1941.\r\n\r\nThe GAO published a report last week in which it\r\ncriticized the Labor Department for paying insufficient\r\nattention to working conditions in manufacturing and\r\nmining in the USA, where many children are still\r\nemployed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs the\r\nnumber of working children between the ages of 15-17 in\r\nthe USA at 3.7 million. One in 16 of these worked in\r\nfactories and construction. More than 600 teens died of\r\nwork-related accidents in the last ten years.\r\n\r\nChild labor - let alone child prostitution, child soldiers,\r\nand child slavery - are phenomena best avoided. But they\r\ncannot and should not be tackled in isolation. Nor should\r\nunderage labor be subjected to blanket castigation.\r\n\r\nWorking in the gold mines or fisheries of the Philippines\r\nis hardly comparable to waiting on tables in a Nigerian or,\r\nfor that matter, American restaurant.\r\n\r\nThere are gradations and hues of child labor. That\r\nchildren should not be exposed to hazardous conditions,\r\nlong working hours, used as means of payment, physically\r\npunished, or serve as sex slaves is commonly agreed. That\r\nthey should not help their parents plant and harvest may\r\nbe more debatable.\r\n\r\nAs Miriam Wasserman observes in \"Eliminating Child\r\nLabor\", published in the Federal Bank of Boston's\r\n\"Regional Review\", second quarter of 2000, it depends on\r\n\"family income, education policy, production\r\ntechnologies, and cultural norms.\" About a quarter of\r\nchildren under-14 throughout the world are regular\r\nworkers. This statistic masks vast disparities between\r\nregions like Africa (42 percent) and Latin America (17\r\npercent).\r\n\r\nIn many impoverished locales, child labor is all that\r\nstands between the family unit and all-pervasive, life\r\nthreatening, destitution. Child labor declines markedly as\r\nincome per capita grows. To deprive these bread-earners\r\nof the opportunity to lift themselves and their families\r\nincrementally above malnutrition, disease, and famine - is\r\nan apex of immoral hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nQuoted by \"The Economist\", a representative of the much\r\ndecried Ecuador Banana Growers Association and\r\nEcuador's Labor Minister, summed up the dilemma\r\nneatly: \"Just because they are under age doesn't mean we\r\nshould reject them, they have a right to survive. You can't\r\njust say they can't work, you have to provide alternatives\".\r\n\r\nRegrettably, the debate is so laden with emotions and self-\r\nserving arguments that the facts are often overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe outcry against soccer balls stitched by children in\r\nPakistan led to the relocation of workshops ran by Nike\r\nand Reebok. Thousands lost their jobs, including\r\ncountless women and 7000 of their progeny. The average\r\nfamily income - anyhow meager - fell by 20 percent.\r\n\r\nEconomists Drusilla Brown, Alan Deardorif, and Robert\r\nStern observe wryly:\r\n\"While Baden Sports can quite credibly claim that their\r\nsoccer balls are not sewn by children, the relocation of\r\ntheir production facility undoubtedly did nothing for their\r\nformer child workers and their families\".\r\n\r\nSuch examples abound. Manufacturers - fearing legal\r\nreprisals and \"reputation risks\" (naming-and-shaming by\r\noverzealous NGO's) - engage in preemptive sacking.\r\n\r\nGerman garment workshops fired 50,000 children in\r\nBangladesh in 1993 in anticipation of the American\r\nnever-legislated Child Labor Deterrence Act.\r\n\r\nQuoted by Wasserstein, former Secretary of Labor, Robert\r\nReich, notes:\r\n\"Stopping child labor without doing anything else could\r\nleave children worse off. If they are working out of\r\nnecessity, as most are, stopping them could force them\r\ninto prostitution or other employment with greater\r\npersonal dangers. The most important thing is that they be\r\nin school and receive the education to help them leave\r\npoverty\".\r\n\r\nContrary to hype, three quarters of all children work in\r\nagriculture and with their families. Less than 1 percent\r\nwork in mining and another 2 percent in construction.\r\n\r\nMost of the rest work in retail outlets and services,\r\nincluding \"personal services\" - a euphemism for\r\nprostitution. UNICEF and the ILO are in the throes of\r\nestablishing school networks for child laborers and\r\nproviding their parents with alternative employment.\r\n\r\nBut this is a drop in the sea of neglect. Poor countries\r\nrarely proffer education on a regular basis to more than\r\ntwo thirds of their eligible school-age children. This is\r\nespecially true in rural areas where child labor is a\r\nwidespread blight. Education - especially for women - is\r\nconsidered an unaffordable luxury by many hard-pressed\r\nparents. In many cultures, work is still considered to be\r\nindispensable in shaping the child's morality and strength\r\nof character and in teaching him or her a trade.\r\n\"The Economist\" elaborates:\r\n\"In Africa children are generally treated as mini-adults;\r\nfrom an early age every child will have tasks to perform in\r\nthe home, such as sweeping or fetching water. It is also\r\ncommon to see children working in shops or on the\r\nstreets. Poor families will often send a child to a richer\r\nrelation as a housemaid or houseboy, in the hope that he\r\nwill get an education\".\r\n\r\nA solution recently gaining steam is to provide families in\r\npoor countries with access to loans secured by the future\r\nearnings of their educated offspring. The idea - first\r\nproposed by Jean-Marie Baland of the University of\r\nNamur and James A. Robinson of the University of\r\nCalifornia at Berkeley - has now permeated the\r\nmainstream.\r\n\r\nEven the World Bank has contributed a few studies,\r\nnotably, in June, \"Child Labor: The Role of Income\r\nVariability and Access to Credit Across Countries\"\r\nauthored by Rajeev Dehejia of the NBER and Roberta\r\nGatti of the Bank's Development Research Group.\r\n\r\nAbusive child labor is abhorrent and should be banned\r\nand eradicated. All other forms should be phased out\r\ngradually. Developing countries already produce millions\r\nof unemployable graduates a year - 100,000 in Morocco\r\nalone. Unemployment is rife and reaches, in certain\r\ncountries - such as Macedonia - more than one third of the\r\nworkforce. Children at work may be harshly treated by\r\ntheir supervisors but at least they are kept off the far more\r\nmenacing streets. Some kids even end up with a skill and\r\nare rendered employable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. The Myth of the Earnings Yield\r\n\r\n\r\nIn American novels, well into the 1950's, one finds\r\nprotagonists using the future stream of dividends\r\nemanating from their share holdings to send their kids to\r\ncollege or as collateral.  Yet, dividends seemed to have\r\ngone the way of the Hula-Hoop. Few companies distribute\r\nerratic and ever-declining dividends. The vast majority\r\ndon't bother. The unfavorable tax treatment of distributed\r\nprofits may have been the cause.\r\n\r\nThe dwindling of dividends has implications which are\r\nnothing short of revolutionary. Most of the financial\r\ntheories we use to determine the value of shares were\r\ndeveloped in the 1950's and 1960's, when dividends were\r\nin vogue.  They invariably relied on a few implicit and\r\nexplicit assumptions:\r\n1. That the fair \"value\" of a share is closely\r\ncorrelated to its market price;\r\n2. That price movements are mostly random, though\r\nsomehow related to the aforementioned \"value\" of\r\nthe share. In other words, the price of a security is\r\nsupposed to converge with its fair \"value\" in the\r\nlong term;\r\n3. That the fair value responds to new information\r\nabout the firm and reflects it  - though how\r\nefficiently is debatable. The strong efficiency\r\nmarket hypothesis assumes that new information is\r\nfully incorporated in prices instantaneously.\r\n\r\nBut how is the fair value to be determined?\r\nA discount rate is applied to the stream of all future\r\nincome from the share - i.e., its dividends. What should\r\nthis rate be is sometimes hotly disputed - but usually it is\r\nthe coupon of \"riskless\" securities, such as treasury bonds.\r\n\r\nBut since few companies distribute dividends -\r\ntheoreticians and analysts are increasingly forced to deal\r\nwith \"expected\" dividends rather than \"paid out\" or actual\r\nones.\r\n\r\nThe best proxy for expected dividends is net earnings. The\r\nhigher the earnings - the likelier and the higher the\r\ndividends. Thus, in a subtle cognitive dissonance, retained\r\nearnings - often plundered by rapacious managers - came\r\nto be regarded as some kind of deferred dividends.\r\n\r\nThe rationale is that retained earnings, once re-invested,\r\ngenerate additional earnings. Such a virtuous cycle\r\nincreases the likelihood and size of future dividends. Even\r\nundistributed earnings, goes the refrain, provide a rate of\r\nreturn, or a yield - known as the earnings yield. The\r\noriginal meaning of the word \"yield\" - income realized by\r\nan investor - was undermined by this Newspeak.\r\n\r\nWhy was this oxymoron - the \"earnings yield\" -\r\nperpetuated?\r\nAccording to all current theories of finance, in the absence\r\nof dividends - shares are worthless. The value of an\r\ninvestor's holdings is determined by the income he stands\r\nto receive from them. No income - no value. Of course, an\r\ninvestor can always sell his holdings to other investors\r\nand realize capital gains (or losses). But capital gains -\r\nthough also driven by earnings hype - do not feature in\r\nfinancial models of stock valuation.\r\n\r\nFaced with a dearth of dividends, market participants -\r\nand especially Wall Street firms - could obviously not live\r\nwith the ensuing zero valuation of securities. They\r\nresorted to substituting future dividends - the outcome of\r\ncapital accumulation and re-investment - for present ones.\r\n\r\nThe myth was born.\r\n\r\nThus, financial market theories starkly contrast with\r\nmarket realities.\r\n\r\nNo one buys shares because he expects to collect an\r\nuninterrupted and equiponderant stream of future income\r\nin the form of dividends. Even the most gullible novice\r\nknows that dividends are a mere apologue, a relic of the\r\npast. So why do investors buy shares? Because they hope\r\nto sell them to other investors later at a higher price.\r\n\r\nWhile past investors looked to dividends to realize income\r\nfrom their shareholdings - present investors are more into\r\ncapital gains. The market price of a share reflects its\r\ndiscounted expected capital gains, the discount rate being\r\nits volatility. It has little to do with its discounted future\r\nstream of dividends, as current financial theories teach us.\r\n\r\nBut, if so, why the volatility in share prices, i.e., why are\r\nshare prices distributed? Surely, since, in liquid markets,\r\nthere are always buyers - the price should stabilize around\r\nan equilibrium point.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that share prices incorporate expectations\r\nregarding the availability of willing and able buyers, i.e.,\r\nof investors with sufficient liquidity. Such expectations\r\nare influenced by the price level - it is more difficult to\r\nfind buyers at higher prices - by the general market\r\nsentiment, and by externalities and new information,\r\nincluding new information about earnings.\r\n\r\nThe capital gain anticipated by a rational investor takes\r\ninto consideration both the expected discounted earnings\r\nof the firm and market volatility - the latter being a\r\nmeasure of the expected distribution of willing and able\r\nbuyers at any given price. Still, if earnings are retained\r\nand not transmitted to the investor as dividends - why\r\nshould they affect the price of the share, i.e., why should\r\nthey alter the capital gain?\r\nEarnings serve merely as a yardstick, a calibrator, a\r\nbenchmark figure. Capital gains are, by definition, an\r\nincrease in the market price of a security. Such an increase\r\nis more often than not correlated with the future stream of\r\nincome to the firm - though not necessarily to the\r\nshareholder. Correlation does not always imply causation.\r\n\r\nStronger earnings may not be the cause of the increase in\r\nthe share price and the resulting capital gain. But\r\nwhatever the relationship, there is no doubt that earnings\r\nare a good proxy to capital gains.\r\n\r\nHence investors' obsession with earnings figures. Higher\r\nearnings rarely translate into higher dividends. But\r\nearnings - if not fiddled - are an excellent predictor of the\r\nfuture value of the firm and, thus, of expected capital\r\ngains. Higher earnings and a higher market valuation of\r\nthe firm make investors more willing to purchase the\r\nstock at a higher price - i.e., to pay a premium which\r\ntranslates into capital gains.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental determinant of future income from share\r\nholding was replaced by the expected value of share-\r\nownership. It is a shift from an efficient market - where all\r\nnew information is instantaneously available to all rational\r\ninvestors and is immediately incorporated in the price of\r\nthe share - to an inefficient market where the most critical\r\ninformation is elusive: how many investors are willing\r\nand able to buy the share at a given price at a given\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nA market driven by streams of income from holding\r\nsecurities is \"open\". It reacts efficiently to new\r\ninformation. But it is also \"closed\" because it is a zero\r\nsum game. One investor's gain is another's loss. The\r\ndistribution of gains and losses in the long term is pretty\r\neven, i.e., random. The price level revolves around an\r\nanchor, supposedly the fair value.\r\n\r\nA market driven by expected capital gains is also \"open\"\r\nin a way because, much like less reputable pyramid\r\nschemes, it depends on new capital and new investors. As\r\nlong as new money keeps pouring in, capital gains\r\nexpectations are maintained - though not necessarily\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nBut the amount of new money is finite and, in this sense,\r\nthis kind of market is essentially a \"closed\" one. When\r\nsources of funding are exhausted, the bubble bursts and\r\nprices decline precipitously. This is commonly described\r\nas an \"asset bubble\".\r\n\r\nThis is why current investment portfolio models (like\r\nCAPM) are unlikely to work. Both shares and markets\r\nmove in tandem (contagion) because they are exclusively\r\nswayed by the availability of future buyers at given prices.\r\n\r\nThis renders diversification inefficacious. As long as\r\nconsiderations of \"expected liquidity\" do not constitute an\r\nexplicit part of income-based models, the market will\r\nrender them increasingly irrelevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. The Future of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\r\n\r\nInterview with Gary Goodenow\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June 2005, William H. Donaldson was forced to resign\r\nas Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission\r\n(SEC).  The reason? As the New York Times put it:\r\n\"criticism that his enforcement was too heavy-handed\".\r\n\r\nPresident Bush chose California Rep. Christopher Cox, a\r\nRepublican, to replace him.\r\n\r\nGary Langan Goodenow is an attorney licensed to\r\npractice in the State of Florida and the District of\r\nColumbia. The Webmaster of\r\nwww.RealityAtTheSEC.com, he worked at the Miami\r\noffice of the SEC for about six years, in the Division of\r\nEnforcement.\r\n\r\nHis experience is varied. As a staff attorney, he\r\ninvestigated and prosecuted cases enforcing the federal\r\nsecurities laws. As a branch chief, he supervised the work\r\nof several staff attorneys. As a Senior Trial Counsel, he\r\nwas responsible for litigating about thirty enforcement\r\ncases at any one time in federal court. As Senior Counsel,\r\nhe made the final recommendations on which cases the\r\noffice would investigate and prosecute, or decline.\r\n\r\nHe describes an experience he had after he left the SEC.\r\n\"I represented an Internet financial writer with a Web\r\nsite that touted stocks, Mr. Ted Melcher of SGA Whisper\r\nStocks.  The SEC sued Ted because as he was singing\r\nthe praises of certain stocks in his articles, he was selling\r\nthem into a rising market. He got his shares from the\r\nissuers in exchange for doing the promotional\r\ntouting. Unfortunately for him, the SEC and the\r\nDepartment of Justice made an example of his case, and\r\nhe went to jail\".\r\n\r\nQ. The SEC is often accused of lax and intermittent\r\nenforcement of the law.  Is the problem with the\r\nenforcement division - or with the law? Can you describe\r\na typical SEC investigation from start to finish?\r\nA. The problem lies with both.\r\n\r\nAt the SEC, the best argument in support of a proposed\r\ncourse of action is \"that's what we did last time\". That will\r\ninevitably please the staff attorney's superiors.\r\n\r\nSEC rules and regulations remind me of an old farmhouse\r\nthat has been altered and adapted, sometimes for\r\nconvenience, other times for necessity. But it has never\r\nbeen just plain pulled down and rebuilt despite incredible\r\nchanges around it. To the uninitiated, the house is\r\nrambling with hidden passages, dark corners, low ceilings,\r\nfolklore and horror stories, and accumulations of tons of\r\nantique rubbish that sometimes no one - not even some\r\nSEC Commissioners - can wade through.\r\n\r\nWandering from room to room in this farmhouse are the\r\nSEC staff.  Regretfully, I found that many are ignorant or\r\nindifferent to their mission, or scornful of investors'\r\nplight, too addicted to their petty specializations in their\r\ndetailed job descriptions, and way too prone to follow\r\nonly the well-trodden path.\r\n\r\nThey are stunned by the rapidity, multiplicity, immensity\r\nand intelligence behind the scams. Their tools of research,\r\ninvestigation and prosecution are confusingly changed\r\nperiodically when Congress passes some new \"reform\"\r\nlegislation, or a new Chairman or new Enforcement\r\nDirector issues some memo edict on a \"new approach\".\r\n\r\nStaff attorneys typically bring investors only bad news\r\nand are numbed by the latters' emotional reactions, in a\r\nkind of \"shell shock\". The SEC lost one quarter of its staff\r\nin the last two years. The turnover of its 1200 attorneys, at\r\n14%, is nearly double the government's average.\r\n\r\nOne SEC official was quoted as saying \"We are losing our\r\nfuture - the people who would have had the experience to\r\nmove into the senior ranks\". Those that stay behind and\r\nrise in the ranks are often the least inspired. At the SEC\r\nenforcement division, one is often confronted with the\r\n\"evil of banality\".\r\n\r\nThe SEC is empowered by the Securities Act of 1933\r\nand the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to seek\r\ninjunctive relief where it appears that a person is engaged\r\nor about to engage in violations of the federal securities\r\nlaws. This is a civil remedy, not a criminal law\r\nsanction. Under well-settled case law, the purpose of\r\ninjunctive relief is deterrence, rather than punishment, of\r\nthose who commit violations. Investors do not know that,\r\nand are uniformly shocked when told.\r\n\r\nThe \"likelihood requirement\" means that, once the\r\nCommission demonstrates a violation, for injunctive relief\r\nit needs only show that there is some reasonable\r\nlikelihood of future violations. \"Positive proof' of\r\nlikelihood, as one court demanded, is hard to provide. At\r\nthe other extreme, I had one former Commissioner tell me\r\nthat, as he understood the law, if the person is alive and\r\nbreathing, the Commission enforcement staff can show\r\nlikelihood of future violations.\r\n\r\nThe broad powers of the federal courts are used in\r\nactions brought by the Commission to prevent securities\r\nviolators from enjoying the fruits of their misconduct. But\r\nbecause this is a civil and not a criminal remedy, the SEC\r\nhas a unique rule where defendants can consent to an\r\ninjunction without \"admitting or denying the allegations\r\nof the complaint\". This leads to what are called \"waivers\",\r\nand I submit that \"waivers\" are the fundamental flaw in\r\nU.S. securities laws enforcement.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, here is the problem. A \"fraudster\"\r\ncommits a fraud. The Commission sues for an injunction.\r\n\r\nThe fraudster consents to the injunction as per above. The\r\nCourt then orders the fraudster to \"disgorge\" his \"ill gotten\r\ngains\" from the scam, usually within 30 days and with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the fraudster doesn't pay it all and the\r\nCommission moves to hold him in civil contempt for\r\ndisobeying the Court's order. The fraudster claims to the\r\nCourt that it is impossible for him to comply because the\r\nmoney is gone and  he is \"without the financial means to\r\npay\". The Commission then issues a \"waiver\" and that's\r\nthe way many cases end. Thus both sides can put the case\r\nbehind them. The fraudster agrees to the re-opening of the\r\ncase if he turns out to have lied.\r\n\r\nThis procedure is problematic. The Commission\r\ntypically alleges that these fraudsters have lied through\r\ntheir teeth in securities sales - but is forced to accept their\r\nword in an affidavit swearing that they have no money to\r\npay the disgorgement. So the waivers are based on an\r\nassumption of credibility that has no basis in experience\r\nand possibly none in fact.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Division of Enforcement has no\r\nmechanism in place to check if the fraudster has, indeed,\r\nlied. After the waiver, the files of the case get stored. The\r\ncase is closed. I don't know if there's even a central place\r\nwhere the records of waivers are kept.\r\n\r\nIn the six years I was at the Commission, I never heard\r\nof a case involving a breach of waiver affidavit. I doubt if\r\none has ever been brought by the Commission -\r\nanywhere. UPI ought to do a Freedom Of Information Act\r\nRequest on that.\r\n\r\nSomething similar happens with the Commission's\r\nmuch vaunted ability to levy civil penalties. The statute\r\nrequires that a court trial be held to determine the\r\negregiousness of the fraud. Based on its findings, the court\r\ncan levy the fines. But, according to some earlier non-\r\nSEC case law, a fraudster can ask for a jury trial regarding\r\nthe amount of the civil penalties because he or she lack\r\nthe means to pay them. U.S. district courts being as busy\r\nas they are, there's no way the court is going to hold a jury\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nInstead, the fraudster consents to a court order \"noting\r\nthe appropriateness of civil penalties for the case, but\r\ndeclining to set them based on a demonstrated inability to\r\npay\". Again, if the fraudster lied, the Commission can ask\r\nthe Court to revisit the issue.\r\n\r\nQ. Internet fraud, corporate malfeasance, derivatives, off-\r\nshore special purpose entities, multi-level marketing,\r\nscams, money laundering - is the SEC up to it? Isn't its\r\nstaff overwhelmed and under-qualified?\r\nA. The staff is overwhelmed.  The longest serving are\r\noften the least qualified because the talented usually leave.\r\n\r\nWe've already got the criminal statutes on the books for\r\ncriminal prosecution of securities fraud at the federal\r\nlevel. Congress should pass a law deputizing staff\r\nattorneys of the Commission Division of Enforcement,\r\nwith at least one-year experience and high performance\r\nratings, as Special Assistant United States Attorneys for\r\nthe prosecution of securities fraud.  In other words, make\r\nthem part of the Department of Justice to make criminal,\r\nnot just civil cases, against the fraudsters.\r\n\r\nThe US Department of Justice does not have the person\r\npower to pursue enough criminal securities cases in the\r\nInternet Age. Commission attorneys have the expertise,\r\nbut not the legal right, to bring criminal prosecution. The\r\nafore-described waiver system only makes the fraudsters\r\nmore confident that the potential gain from fraud\r\noutweighs the risk.\r\n\r\nI'd keep the civil remedies. In an ongoing fraud, with no\r\ntime to make out a criminal case, the Commission staff\r\ncan seek a Temporary Restraining Order and an asset\r\nfreeze. This more closely resembles the original intent of\r\nCongress in the 1930s. But after the dust settles, the\r\ninvesting public deserves to demand criminal\r\naccountability for the fraud, not just waivers.\r\n\r\nQ. Is the SEC - or at least its current head - in hock to\r\nspecial interests, e.g., the accounting industry?\r\nA. \"In hock to special interests\" is too explicit a statement\r\nabout US practice. It makes a good slogan for a Marxist\r\nlaw school professor, but reality is far subtler.\r\n\r\nBy unwritten bipartisan agreement, the Chairman of the\r\nSEC is always a political figure. Two of the five SEC\r\nCommissioners are always Democrats, two Republicans,\r\nand the Chairman belongs to the political party of the\r\nPresident. I am curious to see if this same agreement will\r\napply to the boards established under the Sarbannes-Oxley\r\nAct.\r\n\r\nThus, both parties typically choose a candidate for\r\nChairman of impeccable partisan credentials and\r\nconsistent adherence to the \"party line\". The less\r\nconnected, the less partisan, and academicians serve as\r\nCommissioners, not Chairmen.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman's tenure normally overlaps with a specific\r\nPresident's term in office, even when, as with President\r\nBush the elder following President Reagan, the same party\r\nremains in power. SEC jobs lend themselves to lucrative\r\npost-Commission employment. This explains the dearth of\r\n\"loyal opposition\". Alumni pride themselves on their\r\nconnections following their departure.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman is no more and no less \"in hock\" than any\r\nleading member of a US political party. Still, I faulted\r\nChairman Pitt, and became the first former member of\r\nSEC management to call for his resignation, in an Op/Ed\r\nitem in the Miami Herald. In my view, he was\r\nimpermissibly indulgent of his former law clients at the\r\nexpense of SEC enforcement.\r\n\r\nQ. What more could stock exchanges do to help the SEC?\r\nA. At the risk of being flippant, enforce their own\r\nrules. The major enforcement action against the\r\nNASDAQ brokers a few years ago, for instance, was\r\ntoothless. Presently, Merrill Lynch is being scrutinized by\r\nthe State of New York, but there is not a word from the\r\nNYSE.\r\n\r\nQ. Do you regard the recent changes to the law -\r\nespecially the Sarbanes-Oxley Act - as toothless or an\r\nimportant enhancement to the arsenal of law enforcement\r\nagencies? Do you think that the SEC should have any\r\ninput in professional self-regulating and regulatory bodies,\r\nsuch as the recently established accountants board?\r\nA. It remains to be seen. The Act establishes a Public\r\nAccounting Oversight Board (\"the Board\"). It reflects one\r\nmajor aspect of SEC enforcement practice: unlike in many\r\ncountries, the SEC does not recognize an\r\naccountant/client privilege, though it does recognize an\r\nattorney/client privilege.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, in my experience, attorneys organize at least\r\nas much securities fraud as accountants. Yet in the US,\r\none would never see an \"attorneys oversight board\". For\r\none thing, Congress has more attorneys than accountants.\r\n\r\nSection 3 of the Act, titled \"Commission Rules and\r\nEnforcement\", treats a violation of the Rules of the\r\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board as a\r\nviolation of the '34 Act, giving rise to the same\r\npenalties. It is unclear if this means waiver after waiver,\r\nas in present SEC enforcement. Even if it does, the Rules\r\nmay still be more effective because US state regulators\r\ncan forfeit an accountant's license based on a waived\r\ninjunction.\r\n\r\nThe Act's provision, in Section 101, for the membership\r\nof said Board has yet to be fleshed out. Appointed to five-\r\nyear   terms, two of the members must be - or have been -\r\ncertified public accountants, and the remaining three must\r\nnot be and cannot have been CPAs. Lawyers are the\r\nlikeliest to be appointed to these other seats. The\r\nChairmanship may be held by one of the CPA members,\r\nprovided that he or she has not been engaged as a\r\npracticing CPA for five years, meaning, ab initio, that he\r\nor she will be behind the practice curb at a time when\r\nchange is rapid.\r\n\r\nNo Board member may, during their service on the Board,\r\n\"share in any of the profits of, or receive payments from, a\r\npublic accounting firm,\" other than \"fixed continuing\r\npayments,\" such as retirement payments. This mirrors\r\nSEC practice with the securities industry, but does little to\r\ntackle \"the revolving door\".\r\n\r\nThe Board members are appointed by the SEC, \"after\r\nconsultation with\" the Federal Reserve Board Chairman\r\nand the Treasury Secretary. Given the term lengths, it is\r\nsafe to predict that every new presidential administration\r\nwill bring with it a new Board.\r\n\r\nThe major powers granted to the Board will effectively\r\nchange the accounting profession in the USA, at least with\r\nregards to public companies, from a self-regulatory body\r\nlicensed by the states, into a national regulator.\r\n\r\nUnder Act Section 103, the Board shall: (1) register public\r\naccounting firms; (2) establish \"auditing, quality control,\r\nethics, independence, and other standards relating to the\r\npreparation of audit reports for issuers;\" (3) inspect\r\naccounting firms; and (4) investigate and discipline firms\r\nto enforce compliance with the Act, the Rules,\r\nprofessional standards and the federal securities\r\nlaws. This is a sea change in the US.\r\n\r\nAs to professional standards, the Board must \"cooperate\r\non an on-going basis\" with certain accountants advisory\r\ngroups. Yet, US federal government Boards do not \"co-\r\noperate\" - they dictate. The Board can \"to the extent that it\r\ndetermines appropriate\" adopt proposals by such groups.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, it has authority to reject any standards\r\nproffered by said groups. This will then be reviewed by\r\nthe SEC, because the Board must report on its standards to\r\nthe Commission every year. The SEC may - by rule -\r\nrequire the Board to cover additional ground. The Board,\r\nand the SEC through the Board, now run the US\r\naccounting profession.\r\n\r\nThe Board is also augments the US effort to establish\r\nhegemony over the global practice of accounting. Act\r\nSection 106, Foreign Public Accounting Firms, subjects\r\nforeigners who audit U.S. companies - including foreign\r\nfirms that perform audit work that is used by the primary\r\nauditor on a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. company - to\r\nregistration with the Board.\r\n\r\nI am amazed that the EU was silent on this inroad to their\r\nsovereignty. This may prove more problematic in US\r\noperations in China. I do not think the US can force its\r\naccounting standards on China without negatively\r\naffecting our trade there.\r\n\r\nUnder Act Section 108, the SEC now decides what are\r\n\"generally\" accepted accounting principles. Registered\r\npublic accounting firms are barred from providing certain\r\nnon-audit services to an issuer they audit. Thus, the split,\r\nfirst proposed by the head of Arthur Anderson in 1974, is\r\nnow the law.\r\n\r\nAct Section 203, Audit Partner Rotation, is a gift to the\r\naccounting profession. The lead audit or coordinating\r\npartner and the reviewing partner must rotate every 5\r\nyears. That means that by law, the work will be spread\r\naround. Note that the law says \"partner\", not\r\n\"partnership\". Thus, we are likely to continue to see\r\ninstitutional clients serviced by \"juntas\" at accounting\r\nfirms, not by individuals. This will likely end forever the\r\ndays when a single person controlled major amounts of\r\nbusiness at an accounting firm. US law firms would never\r\ncountenance such a change, as the competition for major\r\nclients is intense.\r\n\r\nAct Section 209, Consideration by Appropriate State\r\nRegulatory Authorities, \"throws a bone\" to the states. It\r\nrequires state regulators to make an independent\r\ndetermination whether Board standards apply to small and\r\nmid-size non-registered accounting firms. No one can\r\nseriously doubt the outcome of these determinations.  But\r\nwe now pretend that we still have real state regulation of\r\nthe accounting profession, just as we pretend that we have\r\nstate regulation of the securities markets through \"blue\r\nsky laws\". The reality is that the states will be confined\r\nhence to the initial admission of persons to the accounting\r\nprofession. Like the \"blue sky laws\", it will be a revenue\r\nsource, but the states will be completely junior to the\r\nBoard and the SEC.\r\n\r\nAct Section 302, Corporate Responsibility For Financial\r\nReports, mandates that the CEO and CFO of each issuer\r\nshall certify the \"appropriateness of the financial\r\nstatements and disclosures contained in the periodic\r\nreport, and that those financial statements and disclosures\r\nfairly present, in all material respects, the operations and\r\nfinancial condition of the issuer\". This may prove\r\nproblematic with global companies. We have already seen\r\nresistance by Daimler-Benz of Germany.\r\n\r\nAct Section 305: Officer And Director Bars And\r\nPenalties; Equitable Relief, will be used by the SEC to\r\ncounterattack arguments arising out of the Central Bank\r\ncase. As I maintained in the American Journal of Trial\r\nAdvocacy, the real significance of the Supreme Court\r\ndecision in Central Bank was that the remedial sanctions\r\nof the federal securities laws should be narrowly\r\nconstrued.\r\n\r\nWell, now the SEC has a Congressional mandate. Federal\r\ncourts are authorized to \"grant any equitable relief that\r\nmay be appropriate or necessary for the benefit of\r\ninvestors\". That is an incredibly broad delegation of\r\nrights, and is an end run around Central Bank.  I was\r\nsurprised that this received no publicity.\r\n\r\nLastly, Act Section 402, Prohibition on Personal Loans\r\nto Executives, shows how low this generation of US\r\nleadership has sunk. President Bush has signed a law that\r\nmakes illegal the type of loans from which he and his\r\nextended family have previously benefited.\r\n\r\nTacitly, the Act admits that some practices of Enron were\r\nnot illegal inter se. Act Section 401, Study and Report on\r\nSpecial Purpose Entities, provides that the SEC should\r\nstudy off-balance sheet disclosures to determine their\r\nextent and whether they are reported in a sufficiently\r\ntransparent fashion. The answer will almost certainly be\r\nno, and the Board will change GAAP accordingly.\r\n\r\nQ. Does the SEC collaborate with other financial\r\nregulators and law enforcement agencies internationally?\r\nDoes it share information with other US law enforcement\r\nagencies? Is there interagency rivalry and does it hamper\r\ninvestigations? Can you give us an example?\r\nA. The SEC and other regulators - as well as two House\r\nsubcommittees - have only very recently begun\r\nconsidering information sharing between financial\r\nregulators.\r\n\r\nThis comes too late for the victims of Martin Frankel,\r\nwho, having been barred for life from the securities\r\nindustry by the SEC and NASD in 1992, simply moved\r\nover to the insurance industry to perpetrate a scam where\r\ninvestors have lost an estimated $200 million dollars.\r\n\r\nHad the state insurance regulators known this person's\r\nbackground, he would have been unable to set up multiple\r\ninsurance companies. Failure to share information is a\r\ngenuine problem, but \"turf\" considerations generally\r\ntrump any joint efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV. Trading from a Suitcase. The Case of Shuttle Trade\r\n\r\n\r\nThey all sport the same shabby clothes, haggard looks,\r\nand bulging suitcases bound with frayed ropes. These are\r\nthe shuttle traders. You can find them in Mongolia and\r\nRussia, China and Ukraine, Bulgaria and Kosovo, the\r\nWest Bank and Turkey. They cross the border as\r\n\"tourists\", sometimes as often as 10 times a year, and\r\ncome back with as much merchandise as they can carry in\r\ntheir enormous luggage. Some of them resort to freight\r\nforwarding their \"personal belongings\".\r\n\r\nThey distort trade figures, smuggle goods across ill-\r\nguarded borders, ignore international treaties and\r\nconventions and, in short, revive moribund economies.\r\n\r\nThey are the life-blood and the only manifestation of true\r\nentrepreneurship in swathes of economic wastelands.\r\n\r\nThey meet demands for consumer goods unmet by\r\ndomestic manufacturers or by officially-sanctioned\r\nimporters.\r\n\r\nIn recognition of their vital role, the worried Kyrgyz\r\ngovernment held a round table discussion last summer\r\nabout the precarious state of Kyrgyzstan's shuttle trade.\r\n\r\nMany former Soviet republics have tightened up their\r\nborder controls. In May last year, Russian officials seized\r\nhalf a million dollars worth of shuttle goods belonging to\r\n1500 traders. When two million dollars worth of goods\r\nwere confiscated in a similar incident in fall 2001, eight\r\nKyrgyz traders committed suicide.\r\n\r\nThe number of Kyrgyz shuttle traders dropped in 2002 to\r\n300,000 (from 500,000 in 1996). The majority of those\r\nwho remain are insolvent. Many of them emigrated to\r\nother countries. The shuttle traders asked the government\r\nto legalize and regulate their vanishing trade and thus to\r\nsave them from avaricious and minacious customs\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nEven prim international financial institutions recognize\r\nthe survival-value of shuttle trade to the economies of\r\ndeveloping and transition countries. It employs millions,\r\nboosts investments in transport and infrastructure, and\r\nencourages grassroots capitalism. The IMF - in the 11th\r\nmeeting of its Committee on Balance of Payments\r\nStatistics in 1998 - officially recognized shuttle trade as a\r\nbusiness activity to be recorded under \"goods\".\r\n\r\nBut there is a seedier and seamier side to shuttle trade\r\nwhere it interfaces with organized crime and official\r\ncorruption. Shuttle trade also constitutes unfair\r\ncompetition to legitimate, tax and customs duties paying\r\nenterprises - the manufacturers of textiles, shoes,\r\ncigarettes, alcoholic drinks, and food products. Shuttled\r\ngoods are not subject to health and safety inspections, or\r\nquality control.\r\n\r\nAccording to the March 27th 2002 issue of East West\r\nInstitute's \"Russian Regional Report\", the value of\r\nChinese goods shuttled into the borderlands of the\r\nRussian Far East is a whopping $50 million a month.\r\n\r\nChina benefits from the serendipitous proceeds of these\r\ninformal exports - but is unhappy at the lost tax revenues.\r\n\r\nEWI claims that Russian banks in the region (such as\r\nDalOVK, Primsotsbank, and Regiobank) are already\r\noffering money transfer services to China. DalOVK alone\r\ntransfers $1 million a month - a fortune in local terms. But\r\neven these figures may be a serious under-estimate. The\r\ntrade between Khabarovsk Territory in Russia and\r\nHeilongjiang Province in China - most of it in shuttle\r\nform - was $1.5 billion in 2001. The bulk of it was one\r\nway, from China to Russia.\r\n\r\nShuttle trade is even more prominent between Iraq and\r\nTurkey. The Anatolia News Agency expected it to\r\nincrease to $2 billion in 2002. By comparison, the official\r\nexports of Turkey to Iraq amount to $800 million. The\r\nthen prime minister Bulent Ecevit himself stated to the\r\nAnkara Anatolia news agency: \"We have provided\r\nnecessary support to increase shuttle trade\".\r\n\r\n\"The Economist\" reports about the flourishing \"petty\r\ntrade\" between China and Vietnam. Western and\r\ncounterfeit goods are smuggled to bazaars in Vietnam,\r\nowned and operated by Chinese nationals. The border\r\nbetween these two erstwhile enemies opened in 1990.\r\n\r\nThis led to the rise of criminal networks which involve\r\nborder guards and policemen.\r\n\r\nAnother hot spot is the Balkan. In a report dated July\r\n2001, the Balkan Information Exchange describes the\r\n\"Tulip Market\" in Istanbul. Vendors are fluent in Russian,\r\nBulgarian and Romanian and most of the clients are East\r\nEuropean. They buy wholesale and use special vans and\r\nbuses to transport the goods - mainly textiles -\r\nnorthwards, frequently to destinations in the Balkan. This\r\nkind of trade is estimated to be worth $8 billion a year -\r\nmore than one quarter of Turkey's official exports.\r\n\r\nBulgarian customs officials, border patrols, and policemen\r\nform part of these efficient rings - as do their Macedonian\r\nand, to a lesser extent, Greek counterparts. The Sofia-\r\nbased Center for the Study of Democracy thinks that a\r\nthird of the Bulgarian workforce (i.e., c. 1 million people)\r\nmay be involved. Many of the traders maintain mom-and-\r\npop establishments or stalls in public bazaars, where\r\nmembers of their family sell the goods.\r\n\r\nSome of the merchandise ends up in Serbia, which was\r\nsubjected to UN sanctions until lately. Fuel smuggling on\r\nbikes and other forms of sanctions busting have largely\r\nended but they have been replaced by cigarettes, alcohol,\r\nfirearms, stolen cars, and mobile phones.\r\n\r\nThe Serbian authorities often round up and deport\r\nBulgarian shuttle traders, provoking furious resentment in\r\nBulgaria. Headlines like \"(Serbian) Policemen take away\r\nour countrymen's money\" and \"Serbs searching\r\n(Bulgarian) women's genitals for money\" are pretty\r\ncommon. The Bulgarians are embittered. They used to\r\nsmuggle medicines and fuel into embargoed Serbia - only\r\nto be abused by Serb officials now, that the embargo has\r\nbeen lifted.\r\n\r\nEast European buyers used to reach as far as India where\r\nthey shopped wholesale in winter. Russians used to buy\r\nreadymade clothes, leather goods, and cheap jewelry in\r\nNew Delhi and elsewhere and sell the goods in the\r\nnumerous flea markets back home.\r\n\r\nTo finance their purchases, they used to sell in India\r\nRussian cosmetics and consumer goods such as watches,\r\ncameras, or hair dryers. But the 1998 financial crisis and\r\nsub-standard wares offered by unscrupulous Indian traders\r\nput a stop to this particular venue.\r\n\r\nGovernments are trying to stem the shuttle trade. The\r\nRussian news agency, ITAR-TASS, reports that Sergei\r\nStepashin, the dynamic chairman of the Russian Audit\r\nChamber (and a former short-lived prime minister of\r\nRussia) is bent on tightening the cooperation between\r\nmember states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.\r\n\r\nThe audit agencies of China, Russia, Kazakhstan,\r\nKyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will exchange\r\ninformation and strive to control the thriving shuttle trade\r\nacross their porous borders. China and Russia are poised\r\nto sign a bilateral accord regarding these issues in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nThe WPS Monitoring Agency reported last November that\r\nthe Economic Development and Trade Ministry of Russia\r\nintends to treat cargos of more than 50 kilos as a\r\nconsignment of commercial goods, subject to import\r\ntariffs (on top of the current tax of 30 percent).\r\n\r\nThe Ministry claimed that shuttle trade accounts for up to\r\n90 percent of all imported goods \"in certain spheres\" (e.g.,\r\nfurs). As late as 1994, Russians were allowed to import up\r\nto $5000 of duty-free goods in their accompanied baggage\r\n- a relic of communist days when only the privileged few\r\nwere allowed to travel.\r\n\r\nUp to 2 million Russian citizens may be engaged in\r\nshuttle trade and the value of \"gray\" goods may be as high\r\nas $10 billion annually. Goods from Turkey alone\r\namounted in 2002 to $1.5-2 billion, according to then\r\nvice-premier Viktor Khristenko, but shuttle traders also\r\noperate in the United Arab Emirates, Syria, Israel,\r\nPakistan, India, China, Poland, Hungary, and Italy.\r\n\r\nA set of figures published for the first quarter of 2001\r\nshows that shuttle trade amounted to $2.6 billion, or 8\r\npercent of Russia's total foreign trade. Shuttle traded\r\ngoods made up 1.5 percent of exports - but a full quarter\r\nof imports.\r\n\r\nBut the shuttle trade's coup de grace may well be EU\r\nenlargement. Already a new \"iron curtain\", comprised of\r\nvisas and regulations, is rising between EU candidates and\r\nother East European and Balkan countries.\r\n\r\nConsider the EU's eastern boundary. More than a million\r\npeople cross the busy Ukrainian-Polish border every\r\nmonth. Enhanced regulation on the Polish side and new,\r\nIMF-inspired, tax laws on the Ukrainian side - led to a\r\nmassive increase in corruption and smuggling. Truck\r\nowners now bribe customs officials to the tune of $300\r\nper vehicle, according to a January 2001 report by CEPS.\r\n\r\nThe results are grave. Following the introduction of these\r\nnew measures, cross border traffic fell by 50 percent and\r\nunemployment in the Polish border zones jumped by 40\r\npercent in 2002 alone. It has since doubled. The IMF and\r\nthe EU are much decried by the Polish minority now\r\ntrapped in Western Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThe situation is likely to be further exacerbated with the\r\nintroduction of a reciprocal visa regime between the two\r\ncountries. Shuttle trade may be decimated by the resulting\r\nbureaucratic bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nStill, it may no longer be needed now that Poland acceded\r\nto the EU. Shuttle trade thrives on poverty. It arbitrates\r\nbetween inefficient markets. It satisfies unrequited\r\ndemand for goods. The single market ought to rid Europe\r\nof all these distortions - and, thus, most probably of this\r\nmakeshift though resilient solution, the shuttle trader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI. The Blessings of the Black Economy\r\n\r\n\r\nSome call it the \"unofficial\" or \"informal\" economy,\r\nothers call it the \"grey economy\" but the old name fits it\r\nbest: the \"black economy\". In the USA \"black\" means\r\n\"profitable, healthy\" and this is what the black economy\r\nis. Macedonia should count its blessings for having had a\r\nblack economy so strong and thriving to see it through the\r\ntransition. If Macedonia had to rely only on its official\r\neconomy it would have gone bankrupt long ago.\r\n\r\nThe black economy is made up of two constituent\r\nactivities:\r\n1. Legal activities that are not reported to the tax\r\nauthorities and the income from which goes\r\nuntaxed and unreported. For instance: it is not\r\nillegal to clean someone's house, to feed people or\r\nto drive them. It is, however, illegal to hide the\r\nincome generated by these activities and not to pay\r\ntax on it. In most countries of the world, this is a\r\ncriminal offence, punishable by years in prison.\r\n2. Illegal activities which, needless to say, are also\r\nnot reported to the state (and, therefore, not taxed).\r\n\r\nThese two types of activities together are thought to\r\ncomprise between 15% (USA, Germany) to 60% (Russia)\r\nof the economic activity (as measured by the GDP),\r\ndepending on the country. It would probably be an\r\nunderestimate to say that 40% of the GDP in Macedonia\r\nis \"black\". This equals 1.2 billion USD per annum. The\r\nmoney generated by these activities is largely held in\r\nforeign exchange outside the banking system or smuggled\r\nabroad (even through the local banking system).\r\n\r\nExperience in other countries shows that circa 15% of the\r\nmoney \"floats\" in the recipient country and is used to\r\nfinance consumption. This should translate to 1 billion\r\nfree floating dollars in the hands of the 2 million citizens\r\nof Macedonia. Billions are transferred to the outside world\r\n(mostly to finance additional transactions, some of it to be\r\nsaved in foreign banks away from the long hand of the\r\nstate). A trickle of money comes back and is \"laundered\"\r\nthrough the opening of small legal businesses.\r\n\r\nThese are excellent news for Macedonia. It means that\r\nwhen the macro-economic, geopolitical and (especially)\r\nthe micro-economic climates will change - billions of\r\nUSD will flow back to Macedonia. People will bring their\r\nmoney back to open businesses, to support family\r\nmembers and just to consume it. It all depends on the\r\nmood and on the atmosphere and on how much these\r\npeople feel that they can rely on the political stability and\r\nrational management. Such enormous flows of capital\r\nhappened before: in Argentina after the Generals and their\r\ncorrupt regime were ousted by civilians, in Israel when\r\nthe peace process started and in Mexico following the\r\nsignature of NAFTA, to mention but three cases. These\r\nreserves can be lured back and transform the economy.\r\n\r\nBut the black economy has many more important\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nThe black economy is a cash economy. It is liquid and\r\nfast. It increases the velocity of money. It injects much\r\nneeded foreign exchange to the economy and\r\ninadvertently increases the effective money supply and the\r\nresulting money aggregates. In this sense, it defies the\r\ndictates of \"we know better\" institutions such as the IMF.\r\n\r\nIt fosters economic activity and employs people. It\r\nencourages labour mobility and international trade. Black\r\neconomy, in short, is very positive. With the exception of\r\nillegal activities, it does everything that the official\r\neconomy does - and, usually, more efficiently.\r\n\r\nSo, what is morally wrong with the black economy? The\r\nanswer, in brief: it is exploitative. Other parts of the\r\neconomy, which are not hidden (though would have liked\r\nto be), are penalized for their visibility. They pay taxes.\r\n\r\nWorkers in a factory owned by the state or in the\r\ngovernment service cannot avoid paying taxes. The\r\nmoney that the state collects from them is invested, for\r\ninstance, in infrastructure (roads, phones, electricity) or\r\nused to pay for public services (education, defence,\r\npolicing). The operators of the black economy enjoy these\r\nservices without paying for them, without bearing the\r\ncosts and worse: while others bear the costs. These\r\nencourages them, in theory to use these resources less\r\nefficiently.\r\n\r\nAnd all this might be true in a highly efficient, almost\r\nideal market economy. The emphasis is on the word\r\n\"market\". Unfortunately, we all live in societies which are\r\nregulated by bureaucracies which are controlled (in\r\ntheory, rarely in practice) by politicians. These elites have\r\na tendency to misuse and to abuse resources and to\r\nallocate them in an inefficient manner. Even economic\r\ntheory admits that any dollar left in the hands of the\r\nprivate sector is much more efficiently used than the same\r\ndollar in the hands of the most honest and well meaning\r\nand well planning civil servant. Governments all over the\r\nworld distort economic decisions and misallocate scarce\r\neconomic resources.\r\n\r\nThus, if the goals are to encourage employment and\r\neconomic growth - the black economy should be\r\nwelcomed. This is precisely what it does and, by\r\ndefinition, it does so more efficiently than the\r\ngovernment. The less tax dollars a government has - the\r\nless damage it does. This is an opinion shares by most\r\neconomists in the world today. Lower tax rates are an\r\nadmission of this fact and a legalization of parts of the\r\nblack economy.\r\n\r\nThe black economy is especially important in times of\r\neconomic hardships. Countries in transition are a private\r\ncase of emerging economies which are a private case of\r\ndeveloping countries which used to be called (in less\r\npolitically correct times) \"Third World Countries\". They\r\nsuffer from all manner of acute economic illnesses. They\r\nlost their export markets, they are technologically\r\nbackward, their unemployment skyrockets, their plant and\r\nmachinery are dilapidated, their infrastructure decrepit\r\nand dysfunctional, they are lethally illiquid, they become\r\nimmoral societies (obligations not honoured, crime\r\nflourishes), their trade deficits and budget deficits balloon\r\nand they are conditioned to be dependent on handouts and\r\ndictates from various international financial institutions\r\nand donor countries.\r\n\r\nRead this list again: isn't the black economy a perfect\r\nsolution until the dust settles?\r\nIt enhances exports (and competitiveness through\r\nimports), it encourages technology transfers, it employs\r\npeople, it invests in legitimate businesses (or is practised\r\nby them), it adds to the wealth of the nation (black\r\nmarketeers are big spenders, good consumers and build\r\nreal estate), it injects liquidity to an otherwise dehydrated\r\nmarket. Mercifully, the black economy is out of the reach\r\nof zealous missionaries such as the IMF. It goes its own\r\nway, unnoticed, unreported, unbeknownst, untamed. It\r\ndoesn't pay attention to money supply targets (it is much\r\nbigger than the official money supply figure), or to\r\nmacroeconomic stability goals. It plods on: doing business\r\nand helping the country to survive the double scourges of\r\ntransition and Western piousness and patronizing. As long\r\nas it is there, Macedonia has a real safety net. The\r\ngovernment is advised to turn a blind eye to it for it is a\r\nblessing in disguise.\r\n\r\nThere is one sure medicine: eliminate the population and\r\nboth unemployment and inflation will be eliminated.\r\n\r\nWithout the black economy, the population of Macedonia\r\nwould not have survived. This lesson must be\r\nremembered as the government prepares to crack down on\r\nthe only sector of the economy which is still alive and\r\nkicking.\r\n\r\nOperational Recommendations\r\nThe implementation of these recommendations and\r\nreforms should be obliged to be GRADUAL. The\r\ninformal economy is an important pressure valve for the\r\nrelease of social pressures, it ameliorates the social costs\r\ninherent to the period of transition and it constitutes an\r\nimportant part of the private sector.\r\n\r\nAs we said in the body of our report, these are the reasons\r\nfor the existence of an informal economy and they should\r\nbe obliged to all be tackled:\r\n? High taxation level (in Macedonia, high payroll\r\ntaxes);\r\n? Onerous labour market regulations;\r\n? Red tape and bureaucracy (which often leads to\r\ncorruption);\r\n? Complexity and unpredictability of the tax system.\r\n\r\nReporting Requirements and Transparency\r\n? All banks should be obliged to report foreign\r\nexchange transactions of more than 10,000 DM\r\n(whether in one transaction or cumulatively by the\r\nsame legal entity). The daily report should be\r\nsubmitted to the Central Bank. In extreme cases,\r\nthe transactions should be investigated.\r\n? All the ZPP account numbers of all the firms in\r\nMacedonia should be publicly available through\r\nthe Internet and in printed form.\r\n? Firms should be obliged by law to make a list of\r\nall their bank accounts available to the ZPP, to the\r\ncourts and to plaintiffs in lawsuits.\r\n? All citizens should be obliged to file annual,\r\npersonal tax returns (universal tax returns, like in\r\nthe USA). This way, discrepancies between\r\npersonal tax returns and other information can lead\r\nto investigations and discoveries of tax evasion\r\nand criminal activities.\r\n? All citizens should be obliged to file bi-annual\r\ndeclarations of personal wealth and assets\r\n(including real estate, vehicles, movables,\r\ninventory of business owned or controlled by the\r\nindividual, financial assets, income from all\r\nsources, shares in companies, etc.).\r\n? All retail outlets and places of business should be\r\nrequired to install - over a period of 3 years - cash\r\nregisters with \"fiscal brains\". These are cash\r\nregisters with an embedded chip. The chips are\r\nbuilt to save a trail (detailed list) of all the\r\ntransactions in the place of business. Tax\r\ninspectors can pick the chip at random, download\r\nits contents to the tax computers and use it to issue\r\ntax assessments. The information thus gathered\r\ncan also be crossed with and compared to\r\ninformation from other sources (see: \"Databases\r\nand Information Gathering\"). This can be done\r\nonly after the full implementation of the\r\nrecommendations in the section titled \"Databases\r\nand Information Gathering\". I do not regard it as\r\nan effective measure. While it increases business\r\ncosts - it is not likely to prevent cash or otherwise\r\nunreported transactions.\r\n? All taxis should be equipped with taximeters,\r\nwhich include a printer. This should be a licencing\r\ncondition.\r\n? Industrial norms (for instance, the amount of sugar\r\nneeded to manufacture a weight unit of chocolate,\r\nor juice) should be revamped. Norms should NOT\r\nbe determined according to statements provided by\r\nthe factory - but by a panel of experts. Each norm\r\nshould be signed by three people, of which at least\r\none is an expert engineer or another expert in the\r\nrelevant field. Thought should be dedicated to the\r\npossibility of employing independent laboratories\r\nto determine norms and supervise them.\r\n? Payments in wholesale markets should be done\r\nthrough a ZPP counter or branch in the wholesale\r\nmarket itself. Release of the goods and exiting the\r\nphysical location of the wholesale market should\r\nbe allowed only against presentation of a ZPP\r\npayment slip.\r\n\r\nReduction of Cash Transactions\r\n? Cash transactions are the lifeblood of the informal\r\neconomy. Their reduction and minimization is\r\nabsolutely essential in the effort to contain it. One\r\nway of doing it is by issuing ZPP payment (debit)\r\ncards to businesses, firm and professionals. Use of\r\nthe payment cards should be mandatory in certain\r\nbusiness-to-business transactions.\r\n? All exchange offices should be obliged to issue\r\nreceipt for every cash transaction above 100 DM\r\nand to report to the Central Bank all transactions\r\nabove 1000 DM. Suspicious transactions (for\r\ninstance, transactions which exceed the financial\r\nwherewithal of the client involved) should be duly\r\ninvestigated.\r\n? The government can reduce payroll taxes if the\r\nsalary is not paid in cash (for instance, by a\r\ntransfer to the bank account of the employee). The\r\ndifference between payroll taxes collected on cash\r\nsalaries and lower payroll taxes collected on\r\nnoncash salaries - should be recovered by\r\nimposing a levy on all cash withdrawals from\r\nbanks. The banks can withhold the tax and transfer\r\nit to the state monthly.\r\n? Currently, checks issued to account-holders by\r\nbanks are virtually guaranteed by the issuing\r\nbanks. This transforms checks into a kind of cash\r\nand checks are used as cash in the economy. To\r\nprevent this situation, it is recommended that all\r\nchecks will be payable to the beneficiary only. The\r\naccount-holder will be obliged to furnish the bank\r\nwith a monthly list of checks he or she issued and\r\ntheir details (to whom, date, etc.). Checks should\r\nbe valid for 5 working days only.\r\n? An obligation can be imposed to oblige businesses\r\nto effect payments only through their accounts\r\n(from account to account) or using their debit\r\ncards. Cash withdrawals should be subject to a\r\nwithholding tax deducted by the bank. The same\r\nwithholding tax should be applied to credits given\r\nagainst cash balances or to savings houses\r\n(stedilnicas). Alternatively, stedilnicas should also\r\nbe obliged to deduct, collect and transfer the cash\r\nwithdrawal withholding tax.\r\n? In the extreme and if all other measures fail after a\r\nreasonable period of time, all foreign trade related\r\npayments should be conducted through the Central\r\nBank. But this is really a highly irregular,\r\nemergency measure, which I do not recommend at\r\nthis stage.\r\n? The interest paid on cash balances and savings\r\naccounts in the banks should be increased (starting\r\nwith bank reserves and deposits in the central\r\nbank).\r\n? The issuance of checkbook should be made easy\r\nand convenient. Every branch should issue\r\ncheckbooks. All the banks and the post office\r\nshould respect and accept each other's checks.\r\n? A Real Time Gross Settlement System should be\r\nestablished to minimize float and facilitate\r\ninterbank transfers.\r\n\r\nGovernment Tenders\r\n? Firms competing for government tenders should\r\nbe obliged to acquire a certificate from the tax\r\nauthorities that they owe no back-taxes.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, they should be barred from bidding in\r\ngovernment tenders and RFPs (Requests for\r\nProposals).\r\n\r\nDatabases and Information Gathering\r\n? Estimating the informal economy should be a\r\npriority objective of the Bureau of Statistics,\r\nwhich should devote considerable resources to this\r\neffort. In doing so, the Bureau of Statistics should\r\ncoordinate closely with a wide variety of relevant\r\nministries and committees that oversee various\r\nsectors of the economy.\r\n? All registrars should be computerized: land, real\r\nestate, motor vehicles, share ownership,\r\ncompanies registration, tax filings, import and\r\nexport related documentation (customs), VAT,\r\npermits and licences, records of flights abroad,\r\nownership of mobile phones and so on. The tax\r\nauthorities and the Public Revenue Office (PRO)\r\nshould have unrestricted access to ALL the\r\nregisters of all the registrars. Thus, they should be\r\nable to find tax evasion easily (ask for sources of\r\nwealth- how did you build this house and buy a\r\nnew car if you are earning 500 DM monthly\r\naccording to your tax return?).\r\n? The PRO should have complete access to the\r\ncomputers of the ZPP and to all its computerized\r\nand non-computerized records.\r\n? The computer system should constantly compare\r\nVAT records and records and statements related to\r\nother taxes in order to find discrepancies between\r\nthem.\r\n? Gradually, submissions of financial statements, tax\r\nreturns and wealth declarations should be\r\ncomputerized and done even on a monthly basis\r\n(for instance, VAT statements).\r\n? A system of informants and informant rewards\r\nshould be established, including anonymous phone\r\ncalls. Up to 10% of the intake or seizure value\r\nrelated to the information provided by the\r\ninformant should go to the informant.\r\n\r\nLaw Enforcement\r\n? Tax inspectors and customs officials should\r\nreceive police powers and much higher salaries\r\n(including a percentage of tax revenues). The\r\nsalaries of all tax inspectors - regardless of their\r\noriginal place of employment - should be\r\nequalized (of course, taking into consideration\r\ntenure, education, rank, etc.).\r\n? Judges should be trained and educated in matters\r\npertaining to the informal economy. Special courts\r\nfor taxes, for instance, are a good idea (see\r\nrecommendation below). Judges have to be trained\r\nin tax laws and the state tax authorities should\r\nprovide BINDING opinions to entrepreneurs,\r\nbusinessmen and investors regarding the tax\r\nimplications of their decisions and actions.\r\n? It is recommended to assign tax inspectors to the\r\npublic prosecutors' office to work as teams on\r\ncomplex or big cases.\r\n? To establish an independent Financial and Tax\r\nPolice with representatives from all relevant\r\nministries but under the exclusive jurisdiction of\r\nthe PRO. The remit of this Police should include\r\nall matters financial (including foreign exchange\r\ntransactions, property and real estate transactions,\r\npayroll issues, etc.).\r\n? Hiring and firing procedures in all the branches of\r\nthe tax administration should be simplified. The\r\nnumber of administrative posts should be reduced\r\nand the number of tax inspectors and field agents\r\nincreased.\r\n? Tax arrears and especially the interest accruing\r\nthereof should be the first priority of the ZPP,\r\nbefore all other payments.\r\n? All manufacturers and sellers of food products\r\n(including soft drinks, sweetmeats and candy,\r\nmeat products, snacks) should purchase a licence\r\nfrom the state and be subjected to periodic and\r\nrigorous inspections.\r\n? All contracts between firms should be registered in\r\nthe courts and stamped to become valid. Contracts\r\nthus evidenced should be accompanied by the\r\nregistration documents (registrar extract) of the\r\ncontracting parties. Many \"firms\" doing business\r\nin Macedonia are not even legally registered.\r\n\r\nReforms and Amnesty\r\n? A special inter-ministerial committee with\r\nMINISTER-MEMBERS and headed by the PM\r\nshould be established. Its roles: to reduce\r\nbureaucracy, to suggest appropriate new\r\nlegislation and to investigate corruption.\r\n? Bureaucracy should be pared down drastically.\r\n\r\nThe more permits, licences, tolls, fees and\r\ndocuments needed - the more corruption. Less\r\npower to state officials means less corruption. The\r\nOne Stop Shop concept should be implemented\r\neverywhere.\r\n? A general amnesty should be declared. Citizens\r\ndeclaring their illegal wealth should be pardoned\r\nBY LAW and either not taxed or taxed at a low\r\nrate once and forever on the hitherto undeclared\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nThe Tax Code\r\n? To impose a VAT system. VAT is one the best\r\ninstruments against the informal economy because\r\nit tracks the production process throughout a chain\r\nof value added suppliers and manufacturers.\r\n? The Tax code needs to be simplified. Emphasis\r\nshould be placed on VAT, consumption taxes,\r\ncustoms and excise taxes, fees and duties. To\r\nrestore progressivity, the government should\r\ndirectly compensate the poor for the excess\r\nrelative burden.\r\n? After revising the tax code in a major way, the\r\ngovernment should declare a moratorium on any\r\nfurther changes for at least four years.\r\n? The self-employed and people whose main\r\nemployment is directorship in companies should\r\nbe given the choice between paying a fixed % of\r\nthe market value of their assets (including\r\nfinancial assets) or income tax.\r\n? All property rental contracts should be registered\r\nwith the courts. Lack of registration in the courts\r\nand payment of a stamp tax should render the\r\ncontract invalid. The courts should be allowed to\r\nevidence and stamp a contract only after it carries\r\nthe stamp of the Public Revenue Office (PRO).\r\n\r\nThe PRO should register the contract and issue an\r\nimmediate tax assessment. Contracts, which are\r\nfor less than 75% of the market prices, should be\r\nsubject to tax assessment at market prices. Market\r\nprices should be determined as the moving average\r\nof the last 100 rental contracts from the same\r\nregion registered by the PRO.\r\n? Filing of tax returns - including for the self-\r\nemployed - should be only with the PRO and not\r\nwith any other body (such as the ZPP).\r\n\r\nLegal Issues\r\n? The burden of proof in tax court cases should shift\r\nfrom the tax authorities to the person or firm\r\nassessed.\r\n? Special tax courts should be established within the\r\nexisting courts. They should be staffed by\r\nspecifically trained judges. Their decisions should\r\nbe appealed to the Supreme Court. They should\r\nrender their decisions within 180 days. All other\r\njuridical and appeal instances should be cancelled\r\n- except for an appeal instance within the PRO.\r\n\r\nThus, the process of tax collection should be\r\ngreatly simplified. A tax assessment should be\r\nissued by the tax authorities, appealed internally\r\n(within the PRO), taken to a tax court session (by a\r\nplaintiff) and, finally, appealed to the Supreme\r\nCourt (in very rare cases).\r\n? The law should allow for greater fines, prison\r\nterms and for the speedier and longer closure of\r\ndelinquent businesses.\r\n? Seizure and sale procedures should be specified in\r\nall the tax laws and not merely by way of\r\nreference to the Income Tax Law. Enforcement\r\nprovisions should be incorporated in all the tax\r\nlaws.\r\n? To amend the Law on Tax Administration, the\r\nLaw on Personal Income Tax and the Law on\r\nProfits Tax as per the recommendations of the IRS\r\nexperts (1997-9).\r\n\r\nCustoms and Duties\r\n? Ideally, the customs service should be put under\r\nforeign contract managers. If this is politically too\r\nsensitive, the customs personnel should be entitled\r\nto receive a percentage of customs and duties\r\nrevenues, on a departmental incentive basis. In any\r\ncase, the customs should be subjected to outside\r\ninspection by expert inspectors who should be\r\nrewarded with a percentage of the corruption and\r\nlost revenues that they expose.\r\n? In the case of imports or payments abroad,\r\ninvoices, which include a price of more than 5%\r\nabove the list price of a product, should be rejected\r\nand assessment for the purposes of paying customs\r\nduties and other taxes should be issued at the list\r\nprice.\r\n? In the case of exports or payments from abroad,\r\ninvoices which include a discount of more than\r\n25% on the list price of a product should be\r\nrejected and assessment for the purposes of paying\r\ncustoms duties and other taxes should be issued at\r\nthe list price.\r\n? The numbers of tax inspectors should be\r\nsubstantially increased and their pay considerably\r\nenhanced. A departmental incentive system should\r\nbe instituted involving a percentage of the intake\r\n(monetary fines levied, goods confiscated, etc.).\r\n? The computerized database system (see\r\n\"Databases and Information Gathering\") should be\r\nused to compare imports of raw materials for the\r\npurposes of re-export and actual exports (using\r\ninvoices and customs declarations). Where there\r\nare disparities and discrepancies, severe and\r\nimmediate penal actions should be taken. Anti-\r\ndumping levies and measures, fines and criminal\r\ncharges should be adopted against exporters\r\ncolluding with importers in hiding imported goods\r\nor reducing their value.\r\n? Often final products are imported and declared to\r\nthe customs as raw materials (to minimize customs\r\nduties paid). Later these raw materials are either\r\nsold outright in the domestic or international\r\nmarkets or bartered for finished products (for\r\nexample: paints and lacquers against furniture or\r\nsugar against chocolate). This should be a major\r\nfocus of the fight against the informal economy. I\r\nfollow with an analysis of two products, which are\r\noften abused in this manner.\r\n? I study two examples (white sugar and cooking\r\noil) though virtually all raw materials and foods\r\nare subject to the aforementioned abuse.\r\n? White Sugar is often imported as brown sugar.\r\n\r\nOne way to prevent this is to place sugar on the list\r\nof LB (import licence required) list, to limit the\r\neffective period of each licence issued, to connect\r\neach transaction of imported brown sugar to a\r\ntransaction of export, to apply the world price of\r\nsugar to customs duties, to demand payment of\r\ncustoms duties in the first customs terminal, to\r\ndemand a forwarder's as well as an importer's\r\nguarantee and to require a certificate of origin. The\r\nsame goes for Cooking Oil (which - when it is\r\nimported packaged - is often declared as some\r\nother goods).\r\n? All payments to the customs should be made only\r\nthrough the ZPP. Customs and tax inspectors\r\nshould inspect these receipts periodically.\r\n? All goods should be kept in the customs terminal\r\nuntil full payment of the customs duties, as\r\nevidenced by a ZPP receipt, is effected.\r\n\r\nPublic Campaign\r\n? The government should embark on a massive\r\nPublic Relations and Information campaign. The\r\ncitizens should be made to understand what is a\r\nbudget, how the taxes are collected, how they are\r\nused. They should begin to view tax evaders as\r\ncriminals. \"He who does not pay his taxes - is\r\nstealing from you and from your children\", \"Why\r\nshould YOU pay for HIM?\" \"If we all did not pay\r\ntaxes- there would be no roads, bridges, schools,\r\nor hospitals\" (using video to show disappearing\r\nroads, bridges, suffering patients and students\r\nwithout classes), \"Our country is a partnership -\r\nand the tax-evader is stealing from the till (kasa)\"\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n*  The phrase \"Gray Economy\" should be replaced\r\nby the more accurate phrases \"Black Economy\" or\r\n\"Criminal Economy\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII. Public Procurement and Very Private Benefits\r\n\r\n\r\nIn every national budget, there is a part called \"Public\r\nProcurement\". This is the portion of the budget allocated\r\nto purchasing services and goods for the various\r\nministries, authorities and other arms of the executive\r\nbranch. It was the famous management consultant,\r\nParkinson, who once wrote that government officials are\r\nlikely to approve a multi-billion dollar nuclear power\r\nplant much more speedily that they are likely to authorize\r\na hundred dollar expenditure on a bicycle parking device.\r\n\r\nThis is because everyone came across 100 dollar\r\nsituations in real life - but precious few had the fortune to\r\nexpend with billions of USD.\r\n\r\nThis, precisely, is the problem with public procurement:\r\npeople are too acquainted with the purchased items. They\r\ntend to confuse their daily, household-type, decisions with\r\nthe processes and considerations which should permeate\r\ngovernmental decision making. They label perfectly\r\nlegitimate decisions as \"corrupt\" - and totally corrupt\r\nprocedures as \"legal\" or merely \"legitimate\", because this\r\nis what was decreed by the statal mechanisms, or because\r\n\"this is the law\".\r\n\r\nProcurement is divided to defence and non-defence\r\nspending. In both these categories - but, especially in the\r\nformer - there are grave, well founded, concerns that\r\nthings might not be all what they seem to be.\r\n\r\nGovernment - from India's to Sweden's to Belgium's - fell\r\nbecause of procurement scandals which involved bribes\r\npaid by manufacturers or service providers either to\r\nindividual in the service of the state or to political parties.\r\n\r\nOther, lesser cases, litter the press daily. In the last few\r\nyears only, the burgeoning defence sector in Israel saw\r\ntwo such big scandals: the developer of Israel's missiles\r\nwas involved in one (and currently is serving a jail\r\nsentence) and Israel's military attache to Washington was\r\nimplicated - though, never convicted - in yet another.\r\n\r\nBut the picture is not that grim. Most governments in the\r\nWest succeeded in reigning in and fully controlling this\r\nparticular budget item. In the USA, this part of the budget\r\nremained constant in the last 35(!) years at 20% of the\r\nGDP.\r\n\r\nThere are many problems with public procurement. It is\r\nan obscure area of state activity, agreed upon in\r\n\"customized\" tenders and in dark rooms through a series\r\nof undisclosed agreements. At least, this is the public\r\nimage of these expenditures.\r\n\r\nThe truth is completely different.\r\n\r\nTrue, some ministers use public money to build their\r\nprivate \"empires\". It could be a private business empire,\r\ncatering to the financial future of the minister, his cronies\r\nand his relatives. These two plagues - cronyism and\r\nnepotism - haunt public procurement. The spectre of\r\ngovernment official using public money to benefit their\r\npolitical allies or their family members - haunts public\r\nimagination and provokes public indignation.\r\n\r\nThen, there are problems of plain corruption: bribes or\r\ncommissions paid to decision makers in return for\r\nwinning tenders or awarding of economic benefits\r\nfinanced by the public money. Again, sometimes these\r\nmoneys end in secret bank accounts in Switzerland or in\r\nLuxembourg. At other times, they finance political\r\nactivities of political parties. This was rampantly abundant\r\nin Italy and has its place in France. The USA, which was\r\nconsidered to be immune from such behaviours - has\r\nproven to be less so, lately, with the Bill Clinton alleged\r\nelection financing transgressions.\r\n\r\nBut, these, with all due respect to \"clean hands\"\r\noperations and principles, are not the main problems of\r\npublic procurement.\r\n\r\nThe first order problem is the allocation of scarce\r\nresources. In other words, prioritizing. The needs are\r\nenormous and ever growing. The US government\r\npurchases hundreds of thousands of separate items from\r\noutside suppliers. Just the list of these goods - not to\r\nmention their technical specifications and the\r\ndocumentation which accompanies the transactions -\r\noccupies tens of thick volumes. Supercomputers are used\r\nto manage all these - and, even so, it is getting way out of\r\nhand. How to allocate ever scarcer resources amongst\r\nthese items is a daunting - close to impossible - task. It\r\nalso, of course, has a political dimension. A procurement\r\ndecision reflects a political preference and priority. But\r\nthe decision itself is not always motivated by rational - let\r\nalone noble - arguments. More often, it is the by product\r\nand end result of lobbying, political hand bending and\r\nextortionist muscle. This raises a lot of hackles among\r\nthose who feel that were kept out of the pork barrel. They\r\nfeel underprivileged and discriminated against. They fight\r\nback and the whole system finds itself in a quagmire, a\r\nnightmare of conflicting interests. Last year, the whole\r\nbudget in the USA was stuck - not approved by Congress\r\n- because of these reactions and counter-reactions.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is the supervision, auditing and\r\ncontrol of actual spending. This has two dimensions:\r\n1. How to make sure that the expenditures match and\r\ndo not exceed the budgetary items. In some\r\ncountries, this is a mere ritual formality and\r\ngovernment departments are positively expected to\r\noverstep their procurement budgets. In others, this\r\nconstitutes a criminal offence.\r\n2. How to prevent the criminally corrupt activities\r\nthat we have described above - or even the non\r\ncriminal incompetent acts which government\r\nofficials are prone to do.\r\n\r\nThe most widespread method is the public, competitive,\r\ntender for the purchases of goods and services.\r\n\r\nBut, this is not as simple as it sounds.\r\n\r\nSome countries publish international tenders, striving to\r\nsecure the best quality in the cheapest price - no matter\r\nwhat is its geographical or political source. Other\r\ncountries are much more protectionist (notably: Japan and\r\nFrance) and they publish only domestic tenders, in most\r\ncases. A domestic tender is open only to domestic bidders.\r\n\r\nYet other countries limit participation in the tenders on\r\nvarious backgrounds:\r\nthe size of the competing company, its track record, its\r\nownership structure, its human rights or environmental\r\nrecord and so on. Some countries publish the minutes of\r\nthe tender committee (which has to explain WHY it\r\nselected this or that supplier). Others keep it a closely\r\nguarded secret (\"to protect commercial interests and\r\nsecrets\").\r\n\r\nBut all countries state in advance that they have no\r\nobligation to accept any kind of offer - even if it is the\r\ncheapest. This is a needed provision: the cheapest is not\r\nnecessarily the best. The cheapest offer could be coming\r\nfrom a very unreliable supplier with a bad past\r\nperformance or a criminal record or from a supplier who\r\noffers goods of shoddy quality.\r\n\r\nThe tendering policies of most of the countries in the\r\nworld also incorporates a second principle: that of\r\n\"minimum size\". The cost of running a tender is\r\nprohibitive in the cases of purchases in small amounts.\r\n\r\nEven if there is corruption in such purchases it is bound to\r\ncause less damage to the public purse than the costs of the\r\ntender which is supposed to prevent it!\r\nSo, in most countries, small purchases can be authorized\r\nby government officials - larger amounts go through a\r\ntedious, multi-phase tendering process. Public competitive\r\nbidding is not corruption-proof: many times officials and\r\nbidders collude and conspire to award the contract against\r\nbribes and other, noncash, benefits. But we still know of\r\nno better way to minimize the effects of human greed.\r\n\r\nProcurement policies, procedures and tenders are\r\nsupervised by state auditing authorities. The most famous\r\nis, probably, the General Accounting Office, known by its\r\nacronym: the GAO.\r\n\r\nIt is an unrelenting, very thorough and dangerous\r\nwatchdog of the administration. It is considered to be\r\nhighly effective in reducing procurement - related\r\nirregularities and crimes. Another such institutions the\r\nIsraeli State Reviser. What is common to both these\r\norgans of the state is that they have very broad authority.\r\n\r\nThey possess (by law) judicial and criminal prosecution\r\npowers and they exercise it without any hesitation. They\r\nhave the legal obligation to review the operations and\r\nfinancial transactions of all the other organs of the\r\nexecutive branch. Their teams select, each year, the\r\norgans to be reviewed and audited. They collect all\r\npertinent documents and correspondence. They cross the\r\ninformation that they receive from elsewhere. They ask\r\nvery embarrassing questions and they do it under the\r\nthreat of perjury prosecutions. They summon witnesses\r\nand they publish damning reports which, in many cases,\r\nlead to criminal prosecutions.\r\n\r\nAnother form of review of public procurement is through\r\npowers granted to the legislative arm of the state\r\n(Congress, Parliament, Bundestag, or Knesset). In almost\r\nevery country in the world, the elected body has its own\r\nprocurement oversight committee. It supervises the\r\nexpenditures of the executive branch and makes sure that\r\nthey conform to the budget. The difference between such\r\nsupervisory, parliamentary, bodies and their executive\r\nbranch counterparts - is that they feel free to criticize\r\npublic procurement not only in the context of its\r\nadherence to budget constraints or its cleanliness - but\r\nalso in a political context. In other words, these\r\ncommittees do not limit themselves to asking HOW - but\r\nalso engage in asking WHY. Why this specific expense in\r\nthis given time and location - and not that expense,\r\nsomewhere else or some other time. These elected bodies\r\nfeel at liberty - and often do - intervene in the very\r\ndecision making process and in the order of priorities.\r\n\r\nThey have the propensity to alter both quite often.\r\n\r\nThe most famous such committee is, arguably, the\r\nCongressional Budget Office (CBO). It is famous because\r\nit is non-partisan and technocratic in nature. It is really\r\nmade of experts which staff its offices.\r\n\r\nIts apparent - and real - neutrality makes its judgements\r\nand recommendations a commandment not to be avoided\r\nand, almost universally, to be obeyed. The CBO operates\r\nfor and on behalf of the American Congress and is, really,\r\nthe research arm of that venerable parliament. Parallelly,\r\nthe executive part of the American system - the\r\nAdministration - has its own guard against waste and\r\nworse: the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\r\n\r\nBoth bodies produce learned, thickset, analyses, reports,\r\ncriticism, opinions and recommendations. Despite quite a\r\nprodigious annual output of verbiage - they are so highly\r\nregarded, that virtually anything that they say (or write) is\r\nminutely analysed and implemented to the last letter with\r\nan air of awe.\r\n\r\nOnly a few other parliaments have committees that carry\r\nsuch weight. The Israeli Knesset have the extremely\r\npowerful Finance Committee which is in charge of all\r\nmatters financial, from appropriations to procurement.\r\n\r\nAnother parliament renowned for its tight scrutiny is the\r\nFrench Parliament - though it retains very few real\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nBut not all countries chose the option of legislative\r\nsupervision. Some of them relegated parts or all of these\r\nfunctions to the executive arm.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, the Ministry of Finance still scrutinizes (and has\r\nto authorize) the smallest expense, using an army of\r\nclerks. These clerks became so powerful that they have\r\nthe theoretical potential to secure and extort benefits\r\nstemming from the very position that they hold. Many of\r\nthem suspiciously join companies and organizations\r\nwhich they supervised or to which they awarded contracts\r\n- immediately after they leave their previous, government,\r\npositions. The Ministry of Finance is subject to a major\r\nreform in the reform-bent government of Prime Minister\r\nHashimoto. The Japanese establishment finally realized\r\nthat too much supervision, control, auditing and\r\nprosecution powers might be a Pyrrhic victory: it might\r\nencourage corruption - rather than discourage it.\r\n\r\nBritain opted to keep the discretion to use public funds\r\nand the clout that comes with it in the hands of the\r\npolitical level. This is a lot like the relationship between\r\nthe butter and the cat left to guard it. Still, this\r\nidiosyncratic British arrangement works surprisingly well.\r\n\r\nAll public procurement and expenditure items are\r\napproved by the EDX Committee of the British Cabinet\r\n(=inner, influential, circle of government) which is headed\r\nby the Ministry of Finance. Even this did not prove\r\nenough to restrain the appetites of Ministers, especially as\r\nquid pro quo deals quickly developed. So, now the word\r\nis that the new Labour Prime Minister will chair it-\r\nenabling him to exert his personal authority on matters of\r\npublic money.\r\n\r\nBritain, under the previous, Tory, government also\r\npioneered an interesting and controversial incentive\r\nsystem for its public servants as top government officials\r\nare euphemistically called there. They receive, added to\r\ntheir salaries, a portion of the savings that they effect in\r\ntheir departmental budgets. This means that they get a\r\nsmall fraction of the end of the fiscal year difference\r\nbetween their budget allowances and what they actually\r\nspent. This is very useful in certain segments of\r\ngovernment activity - but could prove very problematic in\r\nothers. Imagine health officials saving on medicines, or\r\nothers saving on road maintenance or educational\r\nconsumables. This, naturally, will not do.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that no country officially approves of the\r\npayment of bribes or commission to officials in charge of\r\npublic spending, however remote the connection is\r\nbetween the payment and the actions.\r\n\r\nYet, law aside many countries accept the intertwining of\r\nelites - business and political - as a fact of life, albeit a sad\r\none. Many judicial systems in the world even make a\r\ndifference between a payment which is not connected to\r\nan identifiable or discernible benefit and those that are.\r\n\r\nThe latter - and only the latter - are labelled \"bribery\".\r\n\r\nWhere there is money - there is wrongdoing. Humans are\r\nhumans - and sometimes not even that.\r\n\r\nBut these unfortunate derivatives of social activity can be\r\nminimized by the adoption of clear procurement policies,\r\ntransparent and public decision making processes and the\r\nright mix of supervision, auditing and prosecution. Even\r\nthen the result is bound to be dubious, at best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.  Crisis of the Bookkeepers\r\n\r\nThe Future of the Accounting Profession\r\nInterview with David Jones\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 31, 2005, the US Supreme Court overturned the\r\nconviction of accounting firm Arthur Anderson on\r\ncharges related to its handling of the books of the now\r\ndefunct energy concern, Enron. It was only the latest\r\nscene in a drama which unfolded at the height of the wave\r\nof corporate malfeasance in the USA.\r\n\r\nDavid C. Jones is a part-time research fellow at the Center\r\nfor Urban Development Studies of the Graduate School of\r\nDesign, Harvard University. He has been associated with\r\nthe University since 1987 when he retired from the World\r\nBank, where he served as financial adviser for water\r\nsupply and urban development.\r\n\r\nHe had joined the World Bank, as a senior financial\r\nanalyst, in 1970, after working as a technical assistance\r\nadvisor for the British Government in East Africa. He\r\nbegan his career in British local government. He is a\r\nChartered Public Finance Accountant and a Chartered\r\nCertified Accountant (UK). He is the author of\r\n\"Municipal Accounting for Developing Countries\"\r\noriginally published by the World Bank and the Chartered\r\nInstitute of Public Finance and Accountancy (UK) in\r\n1982.\r\n\r\nQ: Accounting scandals seem to form the core of\r\ncorporate malfeasance in the USA. Is there something\r\nwrong with the GAAP - or with American accountants?\r\nA: Accounting is based on some fundamental principles.\r\n\r\nAs I say at the beginning of my textbook, the accountant\r\n\"records and interprets variations in financial position ...\r\nduring any period of time, at the end of which he can\r\nbalance net results (of past operations) against net\r\nresources (available for future operations)\".\r\n\r\nAccountancy includes the designing of financial records,\r\nthe recording of financial information based on actual\r\nfinancial transactions (i.e., bookkeeping), the production\r\nof financial statements from the recorded information,\r\ngiving advice on financial matters, and interpreting and\r\nusing financial data to assist in making the best\r\nmanagement decisions.\r\n\r\nSimple as these principles may sound, they are, in\r\npractice, rather complicated to implement, to interpret and\r\nto practice. About 80% of the transactions require only\r\nabout 20% of the effort because they are straightforward\r\nand obvious to a book-keeper, once the rules are learned.\r\n\r\nBut - and it is a big but - the other 20% or so of\r\ntransactions require 80% of the intellectual effort. These\r\ntransactions are most likely to have major impacts on the\r\nprofit and loss account and the balance sheet.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues and I, all qualified accountants, have\r\nheated discussion over something as simple as the\r\ndefinition of a debit or a credit. Debits can be records of\r\neither expenses or assets. The former counts against\r\nincome in the statement of profit and loss. The latter is\r\ntreated as a continuing resource in a balance sheet. It is\r\nsometimes gradually allocated (expensed) against income\r\nin subsequent years, sometimes not.\r\n\r\nA fundamental problem with the financial reporting of\r\nWorldCom, for example, was that huge quantities of\r\nexpenses were misallocated in the accounts as assets.\r\n\r\nThus, by reducing expenditures, profit appeared to be\r\nincreased. The effect of this on stock values and, thereby,\r\non executive rewards are secondary and tertiary outcomes\r\nnot caused directly by the accountancy.\r\n\r\nAnother example concerns interest on loans that may have\r\nbeen raised to finance capital investment, while a large\r\nasset is under construction, often for several years.\r\n\r\nSome argue that the interest should be accounted for as\r\npart of the capital cost until the asset is operational. Others\r\nclaim that because the interest is an expense, it should be\r\ncharged against that year's profits. Yet, the current year's\r\nincome includes none of the income generated by the new\r\nasset, so profit is under-stated. And what if a hydro-\r\nelectric power station starts to operate three of its ten\r\nturbines while still under construction? How does one\r\nallocate what costs, as expenses or assets, in such cases?\r\nInterestingly, the Generally Accepted Accounting\r\nPrinciples (GAAP) require that \"interest during\r\nconstruction\" be capitalized, that is included in the cost of\r\nthe asset. The International Accounting Standards (IAS)\r\nprefer expensing but allow capitalization. From an\r\neconomic viewpoint, both are wrong - or only partially\r\nright!\r\nThe accountancy profession should get together to\r\nestablish common practices for comparing companies,\r\nlimiting the scope for judgment. Accountants used to\r\nmake the rules in the USA and elsewhere until the\r\nbusiness community demanded input from other\r\nprofessionals, to provide a more \"balanced\" view.\r\n\r\nThis led to the establishment of the Financial Accounting\r\nStandards Board (FASB), with non-accountants as\r\nmembers. The GAAP has been tempered by political and\r\nbusiness lobbying. Moreover, accounting rules for\r\ntaxation purposes and applied to companies quoted on\r\nstock exchanges are not always consistent with the\r\nGAAP.\r\n\r\nAccountants who do not follow the rules are disciplined.\r\n\r\nAmerican accountants are among the best educated and\r\nbest-trained in the world. Those who wish to be\r\nrecognized as auditors of significant enterprises must be\r\nCPAs. Thus, they must have obtained at least a finance-\r\nrelated bachelor's degree and then have passed a five-part\r\nexamination that is commonly set, nation-wide, by the\r\nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants\r\n(AICPA). To practice publicly, they must be licensed by\r\nthe state in which they live or practice. To remain a CPA,\r\neach must abide by the standards of conduct and ethics of\r\nthe AICPA, including a requirement for continuing\r\nprofessional education.\r\n\r\nMost other countries have comparable rules. Probably the\r\nclosest comparisons to the USA are found in the UK and\r\nits former colonies.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you briefly compare the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of the GAAP and the IAS?\r\nA: It is asserted that the GAAP tend to be \"rule-based\"\r\nand the IAS are \"principle-based.\" GAAP, because they\r\nare founded on the business environment of the USA are\r\nclosely aligned to its laws and regulations. The IAS seek\r\nto prescribe how credible accounting practices can operate\r\nwithin a country's existing legal structure and prevailing\r\nbusiness practices.\r\n\r\nAlas, sometimes the IAS and the GAAP are in\r\ndisagreement. The two rule-making bodies - FASB and\r\nIASB - are trying to cooperate to eliminate such\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nThe Inter-American Development Bank, having reviewed\r\nthe situation in Latin America, concluded that most of the\r\ncountries in that region - as well as Canada and the EU\r\naspirants - are IAS-orientated. Still, the USA is by far the\r\nlargest economy in the world, with significant political\r\ninfluence. It also has the world's most important financial\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nQ: Can accounting cope with derivatives, off-shore\r\nentities, stock options - or is there a problem in the very\r\neffort to capture dynamics and uncertainties in terms of a\r\nstatic, numerical representation?\r\nA: Most, if not all, of these matters can be handled by\r\nproper application of accounting principles and practices.\r\n\r\nMuch has been made of expensing employee stock\r\noptions, for instance. But an FASB proposal in the early\r\nnineties was watered down at the insistence of US\r\ncompany lobbyists and legislators.\r\n\r\nHow to value stock options and when to recognize them is\r\nnot clear. A paper on the topic identified sixteen different\r\nvaluation parameters. But accountants are accustomed to\r\ndealing with such practical matters.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you describe the state of the art (i.e., recent\r\ntrends) of municipal finance in the USA, Europe, Latin\r\nAmerica (mainly Argentina and Brazil), and in emerging\r\neconomies (e.g., central and eastern Europe)?\r\nA: There are no standard practices for governmental\r\naccounting - whether national, federal, state, or local. The\r\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) urged\r\naccountants to follow various practices. It subsequently\r\nsettled mainly on accrual accounting standards.\r\n\r\nSome countries - the UK, for local government, New\r\nZealand for both central and local government - use full\r\naccrual at current value, which is beyond many private\r\nsector practices. This is being reviewed in the UK. The\r\ncentral government there is introducing \"resource-based\"\r\naccounting, approximating full accrual at current value.\r\n\r\nThe US Governmental Accounting Standards Board has\r\nrecently recommended that US local governments\r\nproduce dual financial reports, combining \"commercially-\r\nbased\" practices with those emanating from the truly\r\nunique US \"fund accounting\" system.\r\n\r\nIn my book I recognized that fixed assets are being funded\r\nless and less entirely by debt, private sector accounting\r\npractices increasingly intrude into the public sector, and\r\ncosts of services must be much more carefully assessed.\r\n\r\nQ: Are we likely to witness municipal Enrons and\r\nWorld.com's?\r\nA: We already have! Remember the financial downfall\r\nand restructuring of New York City in the seventies.\r\n\r\nOther state and local governments have had serious\r\ndefaults in USA and elsewhere. Shortcomings of their\r\naccounting, politicians choosing to ignore predictive\r\nbudgeting, borrowing used to cover operating\r\nexpenditures - similar to WorldCom. In the case of the\r\nNew York City debacle, operating expenditures were\r\ntreated as capital expenditures to balance the operating\r\nbudget.\r\n\r\nMore recently, I testified to the US Congress about\r\nWashington DC, where the City Council ran up a huge\r\naccumulated operating deficit, of c. $700 million. It then\r\nsought Congressional approval to cover this deficit by\r\nborrowing.\r\n\r\nEven more recently, the State of Virginia decided to\r\nabolish the property tax on domestic vehicles. This left a\r\nhuge gap in the following year's current budget. The\r\ngovernor proposed to use a deceptive accounting device\r\nand to set up a separate - and, thus not subject to a\r\nreferendum - \"revenue\" bond-issuing entity (shades of\r\nEnron's \"Special Purpose Entities\"). The bonds were then\r\nto be serviced by expected annual receipts from the\r\nnegotiated tobacco settlement, at that time not even\r\nfinalized. This crazy and illegal plan was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe fact that both accounting and financial reporting for\r\nlocal governments are very often in slightly modified\r\ncash-based formats adds to the confusion. But these\r\nformats could be built on. Indeed, in the very tight\r\nbudgetary situations facing virtually every local\r\ngovernment, it is essential that cash management on a day-\r\nto-day basis be given high priority.\r\n\r\nStill, the system can be misleading. It produces extremely\r\nscant information on costs - the use of resources - compared\r\nwith expenditures (i.e., cash-flows). More seriously, cash\r\naccounting allows indiscriminate allocation of funds\r\nbetween capital and recurrent purposes, thus permitting no\r\nuseful assessment of annual or other periodic financial\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nA cash-based system cannot engender a credible balance\r\nsheet. It produces meaningless and incoherent information\r\non assets and liabilities and the ownership, or trusteeship, of\r\nseparate (or separable) funds. It is not a sound system of\r\nbudgetary control. When year-end unpaid invoices are held\r\nover, it creates a false impression of operating within\r\napproved budgetary limits. Thus, local government units\r\ncan run serious budgetary deficits that are hidden from\r\npublic view merely by not paying their bills on time and\r\nin full! A cash accounting system will not reveal this.\r\n\r\nStill, moving to an accrual system should be done slowly\r\nand cautiously. Private sector experience, in former Soviet\r\ncountries, of changing to accrual accounting was\r\nadministratively traumatic. Their public sector systems\r\nmay not easily survive any major tinkering, let alone an -\r\neventually inevitable - full overhaul. Skills, tools, and\r\naccess to proper professional knowledge are required\r\nbefore this is attempted.\r\n\r\nQ: Can you compare municipal and corporate accounting\r\nand financing practices as far as governance and control\r\nare concerned?\r\nA: In corporate accounting practice, the notional owners\r\nand managers are the shareholders. In practice, through\r\nthe use of proxies and other devices, the real control is\r\nnormally in the hands of a board of directors. Actual day\r\nto day control reverts to the company chairmen, president,\r\nchief executive or chief operating officer. The chief\r\nfinancial officer is often - though not necessarily - an\r\naccountant and he or she oversees qualified accountants.\r\n\r\nThe company's accountants must produce the annual and\r\nother financial statements. It is not the responsibility of\r\nthe auditors whose obligation is to report to the\r\nshareholders on the credibility and legality of the financial\r\nstatements. The shareholders may appoint an audit\r\ncommittee to review the audit reports on their behalf. The\r\naudit is carried out by Certified Public Accountants with\r\nrecognized accounting credentials. Both the qualified\r\naccountants in the audit firm and those in the corporation\r\nare subject to professional discipline of their accounting\r\ninstitutions and of the law.\r\n\r\nIn local government accounting practice, the public\r\ntrustees and managers are normally a locally elected\r\ncouncil. Often, the detailed control over financial\r\nmanagement is in the hands of a finance committee or\r\nfinance commission, usually comprised only of elected\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, only the elected council may take major\r\nfinancial decisions, such as approving a budget, levying\r\ntaxes and borrowing. Actual day to day control of a local\r\ngovernment may be by an executive mayor, or by an\r\nelected or appointed chief executive. There normally is a\r\nchief financial officer, often - though not necessarily - an\r\naccountant in charge of other qualified accountants.\r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of the accountants of the local\r\ngovernment to produce the annual and other financial\r\nstatements. It is not the responsibility of the auditors\r\nwhose obligation is to report to the local elected council\r\non the credibility and legality of the financial statements.\r\n\r\nThe council may appoint an audit committee to review the\r\naudit reports on their behalf, or they may ask the finance\r\ncommittee to do this.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is quite common, in many countries, for local\r\ngovernment financial statements to be audited by properly\r\nauthorized public officials. Auditors should be qualified,\r\nindependent, experienced, and competent. Audits should\r\nbe regular and comprehensive. It is unclear whether or not\r\npublic official auditors always fulfill these conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom, for example, there is a Local\r\nGovernment Audit Commission which employs qualified\r\naccountants either on its own staff or from hired\r\naccountancy firms. Thus, it clearly follows high standards.\r\n\r\nQ: How did the worldwide trend of devolution affect\r\nmunicipal finance?\r\nA: Outside of the former Soviet Union and Eastern\r\nEurope, municipal finance was not significantly affected\r\nby devolution, though there has been a tendency for\r\ndecentralization. Central governments hold the purse-\r\nstrings and almost all local governments operate under\r\nlegislation engendered by the national, or - in federal\r\nsystems - state, governments. Local governments rarely\r\nhave separate constitutional authority, although there are\r\nvarying degrees of local autonomy.\r\n\r\nIn the former Soviet Empire, changes of systems and of\r\nattitudes were much more dramatic. Local government\r\nunits, unlike under the former Soviet system, are not\r\nbranches of the general government. They are separate\r\ncorporate bodies, or legal persons. But in Russia, and in\r\nother former socialist countries, they have often been\r\ngranted \"de jure\" (legal) independence but not full \"de\r\nfacto\" (practical) autonomy.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be an unwillingness to accept that the two\r\nsystems are intended to operate quite differently. What is\r\ngood for a central government is not necessarily equally\r\ngood for a local government unit. For example, the main\r\npurpose of local government is to provide public services,\r\nwith only enough authority to perform them effectively. It\r\nis almost always the responsibility of a central or state\r\ngovernment to enact and enforce the criminal and civil\r\nlaw. Local by-laws or ordinances are usually concerned\r\nonly with minor matters and are subject to an enabling\r\nlegislation. Moreover, they may prove to be \"ultra vires\"\r\n(beyond their powers) and, therefore, unconstitutional, or\r\nat least unenforceable.\r\n\r\nIt may be appropriate, under certain circumstances, for a\r\ncentral government to run budgetary deficits, whether\r\ncaused by current or capital transactions. In local\r\ngovernment units, there is almost always a necessity to\r\ndistinguish between such transactions. Moreover, in most\r\ncountries, local government units are required by law to\r\nhave balanced budgets, without resort to borrowing to\r\ncover current deficits.\r\n\r\nA corporate body (legal person), whether a private or a\r\npublic sector entity, has a separate legal identity from the\r\ncentral government and from the members, shareholders, or\r\nelectorate who own and manage it. It has its own corporate\r\nname. Typically, its formal decisions are by resolution of its\r\nmanaging body (board or council). Written documents are\r\nauthenticated by its common seal. It may contract, sue and\r\nbe sued in its own name. Indeed, unless specifically\r\nprevented by law, it may even sue the central government!\r\nIt may also have legal relationships with its own individual\r\nmembers or with its staff. It is often said to have perpetual\r\nsuccession, meaning that it lives on, even though the\r\nindividual members may die, resign or otherwise cease their\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\nWhile a corporation owes its existence to legislation, a\r\nlocal government unit is established, typically, under\r\nsomething like a \"Local Government Organic Law\".\r\n\r\nCorporate status differs fundamentally from that of (say)\r\ngovernment departments in a system of de-concentration.\r\n\r\nPermanent closure or abolition of a municipal council, or\r\nindeed any change in its powers and duties, would almost\r\nalways require formal legal action, typically national\r\nparliamentary legislation.\r\n\r\nA local government unit makes its own policy decisions,\r\nsome of which, especially the financial ones, often require\r\napproval by a central government authority. Still, the central\r\ngovernment rarely runs, or manages, a local government\r\nunit on a daily basis. The relationship is at arms length and\r\nnot hands on. A local government unit usually is\r\nempowered to own land and real estate. Sometimes, public\r\nassets - such as with roads or drainage systems - are deemed\r\nto be \"vested in\" the local authority because they cannot be\r\nowned in the same way as buildings are.\r\n\r\nQ: Local authorities issue bonds, partake in joint ventures,\r\nlend to SME's - in short, encroach on turf previously\r\nexclusively occupied by banks, the capital markets, and\r\nbusiness. Is this a good or a bad thing?\r\nA: Local governments are established to provide services\r\nand perform activities required or allowed by law!\r\nNormally, they won't seek or be permitted to engage in\r\ncommercial activities, best left to the private sector.\r\n\r\nHowever, there have always been natural monopolies\r\n(such as water supply), coping with negative economic\r\nexternalities (such as sewerage and solid waste\r\nmanagement), the provision of whole or partial public\r\ngoods (such as street lighting, or roads) and merit goods\r\n(such as education, health, and welfare), and services that\r\nthe community, for economic or social reasons, seeks to\r\nsubsidize (such as urban transport). Left to the private\r\nmarketplace, these services would be absent, or under-\r\nsupplied, or over-charged for.\r\n\r\nSuch services are wholly or partially financed by local\r\ntaxation, either imposed by local governments, or by\r\ncentral (or state) taxation, through a grant or revenue-\r\nsharing system. What has changed in recent years is that\r\nlocal governments have been encouraged and empowered\r\nto outsource these services to the private sector, or to\r\n\"public-private\" partnerships.\r\n\r\nCharges for services, and revenues from taxation cover\r\ncurrent operating expenditures with a small operating\r\nsurplus used to partly fund capital expenditure or to\r\nservice long, or medium term debt, such as bond issues\r\nsecured against future revenues. Commercial banks,\r\nbecause of their tendency to lend only for relatively short\r\nperiods of time, usually have a relatively minor role in\r\nsuch funding, except perhaps as fiscal agents or bond\r\nissue managers.\r\n\r\nOther funding is obtained via direct - and dependence-\r\nforming - capital grants from the central or state\r\ngovernment. Alternatively, the central government can\r\nestablish a quasi-autonomous local government loans\r\nauthority, which it may wholly or partially fund. The\r\nauthority may also seek to raise additional funds from\r\ncommercial sources and make loans on reasonable terms\r\nto the local governments.\r\n\r\nThird, the central government may lend directly to local\r\ngovernments, or guarantee their borrowing. Finally, local\r\ngovernments are left to their own devices to raise loans as\r\nand when they can, on whatever terms are available. This\r\nusually leaves them in a precarious position, because the\r\nmarket for this kind of long and medium term credit is\r\nthin and costly.\r\n\r\nCommercial banks make short term loans to local\r\ngovernments to cover temporary shortages of working\r\ncapital. If not properly controlled, such short-term loans\r\nare rolled over and accumulate unsustainably. That is\r\nwhat happed in New York City, in the seventies.\r\n\r\nQ: In the age of the Internet and the car, isn't the added\r\nlayer of municipal bureaucracy superfluous or even\r\ncounterproductive? Can't the center - at least in smallish\r\ncountries - administer things at least as well?\r\nA: I am quite sure that they can. There are many glaring\r\nexamples of mismatches of sizes, shapes and\r\nresponsibilities of local government units. For example,\r\nNew York, Moscow and Bombay are each single local\r\ngovernment units. Yet, they each have much bigger\r\npopulations than many countries, such as New Zealand,\r\nthe republics of former Yugoslavia, and the Baltic states.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Greater Washington Metropolitan\r\nArea comprises a federal district, four counties and\r\nseveral small cities. The local government systems are\r\nunder the jurisdictions of two states and the federal\r\ngovernment. Each of the two states has a completely\r\ndifferent traditions and systems of local governance,\r\nemanating from pre-independence times. Accordingly, the\r\nlocal government systems north and east of the Potomac\r\nRiver (which flows through the Washington area) are\r\nsubstantially different from those to the south and west.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Boston area, a cradle of U.S. democracy, is\r\ngoverned by a conglomerate of over 40 local government\r\njurisdictions. Even its most famous college, Harvard, is in\r\nCambridge and not in Boston itself. Many of the\r\njurisdictions are so small (Boston is not very big by U.S.\r\nstandards) that common services are run by agencies of\r\nthe State of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe problem of centralizing financial records would,\r\nindeed, be relatively simple to solve. If credit card\r\ncompanies can maintain linkages world-wide, there is no\r\npractical reason why local government accounts for (say)\r\na city in Macedonia could not be kept in China. The issue\r\nhere is quite different. It revolves around democracy,\r\ntradition, living in community, service delivery at a local\r\nlevel, civil society, and the common wealth. It really has\r\nvery little to do with accountancy, which is just one tool\r\nof management, albeit an important one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX. Competition Laws\r\n\r\n\r\nA. THE PHILOSOPHY OF COMPETITION\r\nThe aims of competition (anti-trust) laws are to ensure\r\nthat consumers pay the lowest possible price (=the most\r\nefficient price) coupled with the highest quality of the\r\ngoods and services which they consume. This, according\r\nto current economic theories, can be achieved only\r\nthrough effective competition. Competition not only\r\nreduces particular prices of specific goods and services - it\r\nalso tends to have a deflationary effect by reducing the\r\ngeneral price level. It pits consumers against producers,\r\nproducers against other producers (in the battle to win the\r\nheart of consumers) and even consumers against\r\nconsumers (for example in the healthcare sector in the\r\nUSA). This everlasting conflict does the miracle of\r\nincreasing quality with lower prices. Think about the vast\r\nimprovement on both scores in electrical appliances. The\r\nVCR and PC of yesteryear cost thrice as much and\r\nprovided one third the functions at one tenth the speed.\r\n\r\nCompetition has innumerable advantages:\r\na. It encourages manufacturers and service providers\r\nto be more efficient, to better respond to the needs of their\r\ncustomers, to innovate, to initiate, to venture. In\r\nprofessional words: it optimizes the allocation of\r\nresources at the firm level and, as a result, throughout the\r\nnational economy.\r\n\r\nMore simply: producers do not waste resources (capital),\r\nconsumers and businesses pay less for the same goods and\r\nservices and, as a result, consumption grows to the benefit\r\nof all involved.\r\nb. The other beneficial effect seems, at first sight, to\r\nbe an adverse one: competition weeds out the\r\nfailures, the incompetents, the inefficient, the fat\r\nand slow to respond. Competitors pressure one\r\nanother to be more efficient, leaner and meaner.\r\n\r\nThis is the very essence of capitalism. It is wrong\r\nto say that only the consumer benefits. If a firm\r\nimproves itself, re-engineers its production\r\nprocesses, introduces new management\r\ntechniques, modernizes - in order to fight the\r\ncompetition, it stands to reason that it will reap the\r\nrewards. Competition benefits the economy, as a\r\nwhole, the consumers and other producers by a\r\nprocess of natural economic selection where only\r\nthe fittest survive. Those who are not fit to survive\r\ndie out and cease to waste the rare resources of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nThus, paradoxically, the poorer the country, the less\r\nresources it has - the more it is in need of competition.\r\n\r\nOnly competition can secure the proper and most efficient\r\nuse of its scarce resources, a maximization of its output\r\nand the maximal welfare of its citizens (consumers).\r\n\r\nMoreover, we tend to forget that the biggest consumers\r\nare businesses (firms). If the local phone company is\r\ninefficient (because no one competes with it, being a\r\nmonopoly) - firms will suffer the most: higher charges,\r\nbad connections, lost time, effort, money and business. If\r\nthe banks are dysfunctional (because there is no foreign\r\ncompetition), they will not properly service their clients\r\nand firms will collapse because of lack of liquidity. It is\r\nthe business sector in poor countries which should head\r\nthe crusade to open the country to competition.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the first discernible results of the\r\nintroduction of free marketry are unemployment and\r\nbusiness closures. People and firms lack the vision, the\r\nknowledge and the wherewithal needed to support\r\ncompetition. They fiercely oppose it and governments\r\nthroughout the world bow to protectionist measures. To\r\nno avail. Closing a country to competition will only\r\nexacerbate the very conditions which necessitate its\r\nopening up. At the end of such a wrong path awaits\r\neconomic disaster and the forced entry of competitors. A\r\ncountry which closes itself to the world - will be forced to\r\nsell itself cheaply as its economy will become more and\r\nmore inefficient, less and less competitive.\r\n\r\nThe Competition Laws aim to establish fairness of\r\ncommercial conduct among entrepreneurs and competitors\r\nwhich are the sources of said competition and innovation.\r\n\r\nExperience - later buttressed by research - helped to\r\nestablish the following four principles:\r\n1. There should be no barriers to the entry of new\r\nmarket players (barring criminal and moral\r\nbarriers to certain types of activities and to certain\r\ngoods and services offered).\r\n2. A larger scale of operation does introduce\r\neconomies of scale (and thus lowers prices).\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not infinitely true. There is a\r\nMinimum Efficient Scale - MES - beyond which\r\nprices will begin to rise due to monopolization of\r\nthe markets. This MES was empirically fixed at\r\n10% of the market in any one good or service. In\r\nother words: companies should be encouraged to\r\ncapture up to 10% of their market (=to lower\r\nprices) and discouraged to cross this barrier, lest\r\nprices tend to rise again.\r\n3. Efficient competition does not exist when a market\r\nis controlled by less than 10 firms with big size\r\ndifferences. An oligopoly should be declared\r\nwhenever 4 firms control more than 40% of the\r\nmarket and the biggest of them controls more than\r\n12% of it.\r\n4. A competitive price will be comprised of a\r\nminimal cost plus an equilibrium profit which does\r\nnot encourage either an exit of firms (because it is\r\ntoo low), nor their entry (because it is too high).\r\n\r\nLeft to their own devices, firms tend to liquidate\r\ncompetitors (predation), buy them out or collude with\r\nthem to raise prices. The 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act in\r\nthe USA forbade the latter (section 1) and prohibited\r\nmonopolization or dumping as a method to eliminate\r\ncompetitors. Later acts (Clayton, 1914 and the Federal\r\nTrade Commission Act of the same year) added forbidden\r\nactivities: tying arrangements, boycotts, territorial\r\ndivisions, non-competitive mergers, price discrimination,\r\nexclusive dealing, unfair acts, practices and methods.\r\n\r\nBoth consumers and producers who felt offended were\r\ngiven access to the Justice Department and to the FTC or\r\nthe right to sue in a federal court and be eligible to receive\r\ntreble damages.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to mention the \"intellectual competition\",\r\nwhich opposes the above premises. Many important\r\neconomists thought (and still do) that competition laws\r\nrepresent an unwarranted and harmful intervention of the\r\nState in the markets. Some believed that the State should\r\nown important industries (J.K. Galbraith), others - that\r\nindustries should be encouraged to grow because only size\r\nguarantees survival, lower prices and innovation (Ellis\r\nHawley). Yet others supported the cause of laissez faire\r\n(Marc Eisner).\r\n\r\nThese three antithetical approaches are, by no means,\r\nnew. One led to socialism and communism, the other to\r\ncorporatism and monopolies and the third to jungle-\r\nization of the market (what the Europeans derisively call:\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon model).\r\n\r\nB. HISTORICAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\nWhy does the State involve itself in the machinations of\r\nthe free market? Because often markets fail or are unable\r\nor unwilling to provide goods, services, or competition.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of competition laws is to secure a\r\ncompetitive marketplace and thus protect the consumer\r\nfrom unfair, anti-competitive practices. The latter tend to\r\nincrease prices and reduce the availability and quality of\r\ngoods and services offered to the consumer.\r\n\r\nSuch state intervention is usually done by establishing a\r\ngovernmental Authority with full powers to regulate the\r\nmarkets and ensure their fairness and accessibility to new\r\nentrants. Lately, international collaboration between such\r\nauthorities yielded a measure of harmonization and\r\ncoordinated action (especially in cases of trusts which are\r\nthe results of mergers and acquisitions).\r\n\r\nYet, competition law embodies an inherent conflict: while\r\nprotecting local consumers from monopolies, cartels and\r\noligopolies - it ignores the very same practices when\r\ndirected at foreign consumers. Cartels related to the\r\ncountry's foreign trade are allowed even under\r\nGATT/WTO rules (in cases of dumping or excessive\r\nexport subsidies). Put simply: governments regard acts\r\nwhich are criminal as legal if they are directed at foreign\r\nconsumers or are part of the process of foreign trade.\r\n\r\nA country such as Macedonia - poor and in need of\r\nestablishing its export sector - should include in its\r\ncompetition law at least two protective measures against\r\nthese discriminatory practices:\r\n1. Blocking Statutes - which prohibit its legal entities\r\nfrom collaborating with legal procedures in other\r\ncountries to the extent that this collaboration\r\nadversely affects the local export industry.\r\n2. Clawback Provisions - which will enable the local\r\ncourts to order the refund of any penalty payment\r\ndecreed or imposed by a foreign court on a local\r\nlegal entity and which exceeds actual damage\r\ninflicted by unfair trade practices of said local\r\nlegal entity. US courts, for instance, are allowed to\r\nimpose treble damages on infringing foreign\r\nentities. The clawback provisions are used to battle\r\nthis judicial aggression.\r\n\r\nCompetition policy is the antithesis of industrial policy.\r\n\r\nThe former wishes to ensure the conditions and the rules\r\nof the game - the latter to recruit the players, train them\r\nand win the game. The origin of the former is in the 19th\r\ncentury USA and from there it spread to (really was\r\nimposed on) Germany and Japan, the defeated countries in\r\nthe 2nd World War. The European Community (EC)\r\nincorporated a competition policy in articles 85 and 86 of\r\nthe Rome Convention and in Regulation 17 of the Council\r\nof Ministers, 1962.\r\n\r\nStill, the two most important economic blocks of our time\r\nhave different goals in mind when implementing\r\ncompetition policies. The USA is more interested in\r\neconomic (and econometric) results while the EU\r\nemphasizes social, regional development and political\r\nconsequences. The EU also protects the rights of small\r\nbusinesses more vigorously and, to some extent, sacrifices\r\nintellectual property rights on the altar of fairness and the\r\nfree movement of goods and services.\r\n\r\nPut differently: the USA protects the producers and the\r\nEU shields the consumer. The USA is interested in the\r\nmaximization of output at whatever social cost - the EU is\r\ninterested in the creation of a just society, a liveable\r\ncommunity, even if the economic results will be less than\r\noptimal.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that Macedonia should follow the EU\r\nexample. Geographically, it is a part of Europe and, one\r\nday, will be integrated in the EU. It is socially sensitive,\r\nexport oriented, its economy is negligible and its\r\nconsumers are poor, it is besieged by monopolies and\r\noligopolies.\r\n\r\nIn my view, its competition laws should already\r\nincorporate the important elements of the EU\r\n(Community) legislation and even explicitly state so in the\r\npreamble to the law. Other, mightier, countries have done\r\nso. Italy, for instance, modelled its Law number 287 dated\r\n10/10/90 \"Competition and Fair Trading Act\" after the EC\r\nlegislation. The law explicitly says so.\r\n\r\nThe first serious attempt at international harmonization of\r\nnational antitrust laws was the Havana Charter of 1947. It\r\ncalled for the creation of an umbrella operating\r\norganization (the International Trade Organization or\r\n\"ITO\") and incorporated an extensive body of universal\r\nantitrust rules in nine of its articles. Members were\r\nrequired to \"prevent business practices affecting\r\ninternational trade which restrained competition, limited\r\naccess to markets, or fostered monopolistic control\r\nwhenever such practices had harmful effects on the\r\nexpansion of production or trade\". the latter included:\r\na. Fixing prices, terms, or conditions to be observed\r\nin dealing with others in the purchase, sale, or lease of any\r\nproduct;\r\nb. Excluding enterprises from, or allocating or\r\ndividing, any territorial market or field of business\r\nactivity, or allocating customers, or fixing sales\r\nquotas or purchase quotas;\r\nc. Discriminating against particular enterprises;\r\nd. Limiting production or fixing production quotas;\r\ne. Preventing by agreement the development or\r\napplication of technology or invention, whether\r\npatented or non-patented; and\r\nf. Extending the use of rights under intellectual\r\nproperty protections to matters which, according to\r\na member's laws and regulations, are not within\r\nthe scope of such grants, or to products or\r\nconditions of production, use, or sale which are\r\nnot likewise the subject of such grants.\r\n\r\nGATT 1947 was a mere bridging agreement but the\r\nHavana Charter languished and died due to the objections\r\nof a protectionist US Senate.\r\n\r\nThere are no antitrust/competition rules either in GATT\r\n1947 or in GATT/WTO 1994, but their provisions on\r\nantidumping and countervailing duty actions and\r\ngovernment subsidies constitute some elements of a more\r\ngeneral antitrust/competition law.\r\n\r\nGATT, though, has an International Antitrust Code\r\nWriting Group which produced a \"Draft International\r\nAntitrust Code\" (10/7/93). It is reprinted in II, 64\r\nAntitrust & Trade Regulation Reporter (BNA), Special\r\nSupplement at S-3 (19/8/93).\r\n\r\nFour principles guided the (mostly German) authors:\r\n1. National laws should be applied to solve\r\ninternational competition problems;\r\n2. Parties, regardless of origin, should be treated as\r\nlocals;\r\n3. A minimum standard for national antitrust rules\r\nshould be set (stricter measures would be\r\nwelcome); and\r\n4. The establishment of an international authority to\r\nsettle disputes between parties over antitrust\r\nissues.\r\n\r\nThe 29 (well-off) members of the Organization for\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) formed\r\nrules governing the harmonization and coordination of\r\ninternational antitrust/competition regulation among its\r\nmember nations (\"The Revised Recommendation of the\r\nOECD Council Concerning Cooperation between Member\r\nCountries on Restrictive Business Practices Affecting\r\nInternational Trade,\" OECD Doc. No. C(86)44 (Final)\r\n(June 5, 1986), also in 25 International Legal Materials\r\n1629 (1986). A revised version was reissued. According\r\nto it, \" .Enterprises should refrain from abuses of a\r\ndominant market position; permit purchasers, distributors,\r\nand suppliers to freely conduct their businesses; refrain\r\nfrom cartels or restrictive agreements; and consult and\r\ncooperate with competent authorities of interested\r\ncountries\".\r\n\r\nAn agency in one of the member countries tackling an\r\nantitrust case, usually notifies another member country\r\nwhenever an antitrust enforcement action may affect\r\nimportant interests of that country or its nationals (see:\r\nOECD Recommendations on Predatory Pricing, 1989).\r\n\r\nThe United States has bilateral antitrust agreements with\r\nAustralia, Canada, and Germany, which was followed by\r\na bilateral agreement with the EU in 1991. These provide\r\nfor coordinated antitrust investigations and prosecutions.\r\n\r\nThe United States thus reduced the legal and political\r\nobstacles which faced its extraterritorial prosecutions and\r\nenforcement. The agreements require one party to notify\r\nthe other of imminent antitrust actions, to share relevant\r\ninformation, and to consult on potential policy changes.\r\n\r\nThe EU-U.S. Agreement contains a \"comity\" principle\r\nunder which each side promises to take into consideration\r\nthe other's interests when considering antitrust\r\nprosecutions. A similar principle is at the basis of Chapter\r\n15 of the North American Free Trade Agreement\r\n(NAFTA) - cooperation on antitrust matters.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Restrictive Business\r\nPractices adopted a code of conduct in 1979/1980 that was\r\nlater integrated as a U.N. General Assembly Resolution\r\n[U.N. Doc. TD/RBP/10 (1980)]: \"The Set of\r\nMultilaterally Agreed Equitable Principles and Rules\".\r\n\r\nAccording to its provisions, \"independent enterprises\r\nshould refrain from certain practices when they would\r\nlimit access to markets or otherwise unduly restrain\r\ncompetition\".\r\n\r\nThe following business practices are prohibited:\r\n1. Agreements to fix prices (including export and\r\nimport prices);\r\n2. Collusive tendering;\r\n3. Market or customer allocation (division)\r\narrangements;\r\n4. Allocation of sales or production by quota;\r\n5. Collective action to enforce arrangements, e.g., by\r\nconcerted refusals to deal;\r\n6. Concerted refusal to sell to potential importers;\r\nand\r\n7. Collective denial of access to an arrangement, or\r\nassociation, where such access is crucial to\r\ncompetition and such denial might hamper it. In\r\naddition, businesses are forbidden to engage in the\r\nabuse of a dominant position in the market by\r\nlimiting access to it or by otherwise restraining\r\ncompetition by:\r\na. Predatory behaviour towards\r\ncompetitors;\r\nb. Discriminatory pricing or terms or\r\nconditions in the supply or purchase\r\nof goods or services;\r\nc. Mergers, takeovers, joint ventures,\r\nor other acquisitions of control;\r\nd. Fixing prices for exported goods or\r\nresold imported goods;\r\ne. Import restrictions on legitimately-\r\nmarked trademarked goods;\r\nf. Unjustifiably - whether partially or\r\ncompletely - refusing to deal on an\r\nenterprise's customary commercial\r\nterms, making the supply of goods\r\nor services dependent on\r\nrestrictions on the distribution or\r\nmanufacturer of other goods,\r\nimposing restrictions on the resale\r\nor exportation of the same or other\r\ngoods, and purchase \"tie-ins\".\r\n\r\nC. ANTI - COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES\r\nAny Competition Law in Macedonia should, in my view,\r\nexcplicitly include strict prohibitions of the following\r\npractices (further details can be found in Porter's book -\r\n\"Competitive Strategy\").\r\n\r\nThese practices characterize the Macedonian market.\r\n\r\nThey influence the Macedonian economy by discouraging\r\nforeign investors, encouraging inefficiencies and\r\nmismanagement, sustaining artificially high prices,\r\nmisallocating very scarce resources, increasing\r\nunemployment, fostering corrupt and criminal practices\r\nand, in general, preventing the growth that Macedonia\r\ncould have attained.\r\n\r\nStrategies for Monopolization\r\nExclude competitors from distribution channels. - This is\r\ncommon practice in many countries. Open threats are\r\nmade by the manufacturers of popular products: \"If you\r\ndistribute my competitor's products - you cannot distribute\r\nmine. So, choose.\" Naturally, retail outlets, dealers and\r\ndistributors will always prefer the popular product to the\r\nnew. This practice not only blocks competition - but also\r\ninnovation, trade and choice or variety.\r\n\r\nBuy up competitors and potential competitors. - There is\r\nnothing wrong with that. Under certain circumstances, this\r\nis even desirable. Think about the Banking System: it is\r\nalways better to have fewer banks with bigger capital than\r\nmany small banks with capital inadequacy (remember the\r\nTAT affair). So, consolidation is sometimes welcome,\r\nespecially where scale represents viability and a higher\r\ndegree of consumer protection. The line is thin and is\r\ncomposed of both quantitative and qualitative criteria.\r\n\r\nOne way to measure the desirability of such mergers and\r\nacquisitions (M&A) is the level of market concentration\r\nfollowing the M&A. Is a new monopoly created? Will the\r\nnew entity be able to set prices unperturbed? stamp out its\r\nother competitors? If so, it is not desirable and should be\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nEvery merger in the USA must be approved by the\r\nantitrust authorities. When multinationals merge, they\r\nmust get the approval of all the competition authorities in\r\nall the territories in which they operate. The purchase of\r\n\"Intuit\" by \"Microsoft\" was prevented by the antitrust\r\ndepartment (the \"Trust-busters\"). A host of airlines was\r\nconducting a drawn out battle with competition authorities\r\nin the EU, UK and the USA lately.\r\n\r\nUse predatory [below-cost] pricing (also known as\r\ndumping) to eliminate competitors. - This tactic is mostly\r\nused by manufacturers in developing or emerging\r\neconomies and in Japan. It consists of \"pricing the\r\ncompetition out of the markets\". The predator sells his\r\nproducts at a price which is lower even than the costs of\r\nproduction. The result is that he swamps the market,\r\ndriving out all other competitors. Once he is left alone - he\r\nraises his prices back to normal and, often, above normal.\r\n\r\nThe dumper loses money in the dumping operation and\r\ncompensates for these losses by charging inflated prices\r\nafter having the competition eliminated.\r\n\r\nRaise scale-economy barriers. - Take unfair advantage of\r\nsize and the resulting scale economies to force conditions\r\nupon the competition or upon the distribution channels. In\r\nmany countries Big Industry lobbies for a legislation\r\nwhich will fit its purposes and exclude its (smaller)\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\nIncrease \"market power (share) and hence profit\r\npotential\".\r\n\r\nStudy the industry's \"potential\" structure and ways it\r\ncan be made less competitive. - Even thinking about sin\r\nor planning it should be prohibited. Many industries have\r\n\"think tanks\" and experts whose sole function is to show\r\nthe firm the way to minimize competition and to increase\r\nits market shares. Admittedly, the line is very thin: when\r\ndoes a Marketing Plan become criminal?\r\nArrange for a \"rise in entry barriers to block later\r\nentrants\" and \"inflict losses on the entrant\". - This\r\ncould be done by imposing bureaucratic obstacles (of\r\nlicencing, permits and taxation), scale hindrances (no\r\npossibility to distribute small quantities), \"old boy\r\nnetworks\" which share political clout and research and\r\ndevelopment, using intellectual property right to block\r\nnew entrants and other methods too numerous to recount.\r\n\r\nAn effective law should block any action which prevents\r\nnew entry to a market.\r\n\r\nBuy up firms in other industries \"as a base from which\r\nto change industry structures\" there. - This is a way of\r\nsecuring exclusive sources of supply of raw materials,\r\nservices and complementing products. If a company owns\r\nits suppliers and they are single or almost single sources\r\nof supply - in effect it has monopolized the market. If a\r\nsoftware company owns another software company with a\r\nproduct which can be incorporated in its own products -\r\nand the two have substantial market shares in their\r\nmarkets - then their dominant positions will reinforce each\r\nother's.\r\n\"Find ways to encourage particular competitors out of\r\nthe industry\". - If you can't intimidate your competitors\r\nyou might wish to \"make them an offer that they cannot\r\nrefuse\". One way is to buy them, to bribe the key\r\npersonnel, to offer tempting opportunities in other\r\nmarkets, to swap markets (I will give you my market\r\nshare in a market which I do not really care about and you\r\nwill give me your market share in a market in which we\r\nare competitors). Other ways are to give the competitors\r\nassets, distribution channels and so on providing that they\r\ncollude in a cartel.\r\n\"Send signals to encourage competition to exit\" the\r\nindustry. - Such signals could be threats, promises, policy\r\nmeasures, attacks on the integrity and quality of the\r\ncompetitor, announcement that the company has set a\r\ncertain market share as its goal (and will, therefore, not\r\ntolerate anyone trying to prevent it from attaining this\r\nmarket share) and any action which directly or indirectly\r\nintimidates or convinces competitors to leave the industry.\r\n\r\nSuch an action need not be positive - it can be negative,\r\nneed not be done by the company - can be done by its\r\npolitical proxies, need not be planned - could be\r\naccidental. The results are what matters.\r\n\r\nMacedonia's Competition Law should outlaw the\r\nfollowing, as well:\r\n'Intimidate' Competitors\r\nRaise \"mobility\" barriers to keep competitors in the\r\nleast-profitable segments of the industry. - This is a tactic\r\nwhich preserves the appearance of competition while\r\nsubverting it. Certain segments, usually less profitable or\r\ntoo small to be of interest, or with dim growth prospects,\r\nor which are likely to be opened to fierce domestic and\r\nforeign competition are left to the competition. The more\r\nlucrative parts of the markets are zealously guarded by the\r\ncompany. Through legislation, policy measures,\r\nwithholding of technology and know-how - the firm\r\nprevents its competitors from crossing the river into its\r\nprotected turf.\r\n\r\nLet little firms \"develop\" an industry and then come in\r\nand take it over. - This is precisely what Netscape is\r\nsaying that Microsoft is doing to it. Netscape developed\r\nthe now lucrative Browser Application market. Microsoft\r\nwas wrong in discarding the Internet as a fad. When it was\r\nfound to be wrong - Microsoft reversed its position and\r\ncame up with its own (then, technologically inferior)\r\nbrowser (the Internet Explorer). It offered it free (sound\r\nsuspiciously like dumping) to buyers of its operating\r\nsystem, \"Windows\". Inevitably it captured more than 30%\r\nof the market, crowding out Netscape. It is the view of the\r\nantitrust authorities in the USA that Microsoft utilized its\r\ndominant position in one market (that of the Operating\r\nSystems) to annihilate a competitor in another (that of the\r\nbrowsers).\r\n\r\nEngage in \"promotional warfare\" by \"attacking shares\r\nof others\". - This is when the gist of a marketing,\r\nlobbying, or advertising campaign is to capture the market\r\nshare of the competition. Direct attack is then made on the\r\ncompetition just in order to abolish it. To sell more in\r\norder to maximize profits, is allowed and meritorious - to\r\nsell more in order to eliminate the competition is wrong\r\nand should be disallowed.\r\n\r\nUse price retaliation to \"discipline\" competitors. -\r\nThrough dumping or even unreasonable and excessive\r\ndiscounting. This could be achieved not only through the\r\nprice itself. An exceedingly long credit term offered to a\r\ndistributor or to a buyer is a way of reducing the price.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to sales, promotions, vouchers, gifts.\r\n\r\nThey are all ways to reduce the effective price. The\r\ncustomer calculates the money value of these benefits and\r\ndeducts them from the price.\r\n\r\nEstablish a \"pattern\" of severe retaliation against\r\nchallengers to \"communicate commitment\" to resist\r\nefforts to win market share. - Again, this retaliation can\r\ntake a myriad of forms: malicious advertising, a media\r\ncampaign, adverse legislation, blocking distribution\r\nchannels, staging a hostile bid in the stock exchange just\r\nin order to disrupt the proper and orderly management of\r\nthe competitor. Anything which derails the competitor\r\nwhenever he makes a headway, gains a larger market\r\nshare, launches a new product - can be construed as a\r\n\"pattern of retaliation\".\r\n\r\nMaintain excess capacity to be used for \"fighting\"\r\npurposes to discipline ambitious rivals. - Such excess\r\ncapacity could belong to the offending firm or - through\r\ncartel or other arrangements - to a group of offending\r\nfirms.\r\n\r\nPublicize one's \"commitment to resist entry\" into the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nPublicize the fact that one has a \"monitoring system\" to\r\ndetect any aggressive acts of competitors.\r\n\r\nAnnounce in advance \"market share targets\" to\r\nintimidate competitors into yielding their market share.\r\n\r\nProliferate Brand Names\r\nContract with customers to \"meet or match all price cuts\r\n(offered by the competition)\" thus denying rivals any\r\nhope of growth through price competition.\r\n\r\nSecure a big enough market share to \"corner\" the\r\n\"learning curve,\" thus denying rivals an opportunity to\r\nbecome efficient. - Efficiency is gained by an increase in\r\nmarket share. Such an increase leads to new demands\r\nimposed by the market, to modernization, innovation, the\r\nintroduction of new management techniques (example:\r\nJust In Time inventory management), joint ventures,\r\ntraining of personnel, technology transfers, development\r\nof proprietary intellectual property and so on. Deprived of\r\na growing market share - the competitor will not feel\r\npressurized to learn and to better itself. In due time, it will\r\ndwindle and die.\r\n\r\nAcquire a wall of \"defensive\" patents to deny\r\ncompetitors access to the latest technology.\r\n\"Harvest\" market position in a no-growth industry by\r\nraising prices, lowering quality, and stopping all\r\ninvestment and advertising in it.\r\n\r\nCreate or encourage capital scarcity. - By colluding with\r\nsources of financing (e.g., regional, national, or\r\ninvestment banks), by absorbing any capital offered by the\r\nState, by the capital markets, through the banks, by\r\nspreading malicious news which serve to lower the credit-\r\nworthiness of the competition, by legislating special tax\r\nand financing loopholes and so on.\r\n\r\nIntroduce high advertising-intensity. - This is very\r\ndifficult to measure. There could be no objective criteria\r\nwhich will not go against the grain of the fundamental\r\nright to freedom of expression. However, truth in\r\nadvertising should be strictly imposed. Practices such as\r\ndragging a competitor through the mud or derogatorily\r\nreferring to its products or services in advertising\r\ncampaigns should be banned and the ban should be\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nProliferate \"brand names\" to make it too expensive for\r\nsmall firms to grow. - By creating and maintaining a host\r\nof absolutely unnecessary brandnames, the competition's\r\nbrandnames are crowded out. Again, this cannot be\r\nlegislated against. A firm has the right to create and\r\nmaintain as many brandnames as it wishes. The market\r\nwill exact a price and thus punish such a company\r\nbecause, ultimately, its own brandname will suffer from\r\nthe proliferation.\r\n\r\nGet a \"corner\" (control, manipulate and regulate) on\r\nraw materials, government licenses, contracts, subsidies,\r\nand patents (and, of course, prevent the competition\r\nfrom having access to them).\r\n\r\nBuild up \"political capital\" with government bodies;\r\noverseas, get \"protection\" from \"the host government\".\r\n'Vertical' Barriers\r\nPractice a \"preemptive strategy\" by capturing all\r\ncapacity expansion in the industry (simply buying it,\r\nleasing it or taking over the companies that own or\r\ndevelop it).\r\n\r\nThis serves to \"deny competitors enough residual\r\ndemand\". Residual demand, as we previously explained,\r\ncauses firms to be efficient. Once efficient, they develop\r\nenough power to \"credibly retaliate\" and thereby \"enforce\r\nan orderly expansion process\" to prevent overcapacity\r\nCreate \"switching\" costs. - Through legislation,\r\nbureaucracy, control of the media, cornering advertising\r\nspace in the media, controlling infrastructure, owning\r\nintellectual property, owning, controlling or intimidating\r\ndistribution channels and suppliers and so on.\r\n\r\nImpose vertical \"price squeezes\". - By owning,\r\ncontrolling, colluding with, or intimidating suppliers and\r\ndistributors, marketing channels and wholesale and retail\r\noutlets into not collaborating with the competition.\r\n\r\nPractice vertical integration (buying suppliers and\r\ndistribution and marketing channels).\r\n\r\nThis has the following effects:\r\nThe firm gains a \"tap (access) into technology\" and\r\nmarketing information in an adjacent industry. It defends\r\nitself against a supplier's too-high or even realistic prices.\r\n\r\nIt defends itself against foreclosure, bankruptcy and\r\nrestructuring or reorganization. Owning suppliers means\r\nthat the supplies do not cease even when payment is not\r\naffected, for instance.\r\n\r\nIt \"protects proprietary information from suppliers\" -\r\notherwise the firm might have to give outsiders access to\r\nits technology, processes, formulas and other intellectual\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIt raises entry and mobility barriers against competitors.\r\n\r\nThis is why the State should legislate and act against any\r\npurchase, or other types of control of suppliers and\r\nmarketing channels which service competitors and thus\r\nenhance competition.\r\n\r\nIt serves to \"prove that a threat of full integration is\r\ncredible\" and thus intimidate competitors.\r\n\r\nFinally, it gets \"detailed cost information\" in an adjacent\r\nindustry (but doesn't integrate it into a \"highly competitive\r\nindustry\").\r\n\"Capture distribution outlets\" by vertical integration to\r\n\"increase barriers\".\r\n'Consolidate' the Industry\r\nSend \"signals\" to threaten, bluff, preempt, or collude\r\nwith competitors.\r\n\r\nUse a \"fighting brand\" (a low-price brand used only for\r\nprice-cutting).\r\n\r\nUse \"cross parry\" (retaliate in another part of a\r\ncompetitor's market).\r\n\r\nHarass competitors with antitrust suits and other\r\nlitigious techniques.\r\n\r\nUse \"brute force\" (\"massed resources\" applied \"with\r\nfinesse\") to attack competitors\r\nor use \"focal points\" of pressure to collude with\r\ncompetitors on price.\r\n\"Load up customers\" at cut-rate prices to \"deny new\r\nentrants a base\" and force them to \"withdraw\" from\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nPractice \"buyer selection,\" focusing on those that are\r\nthe most \"vulnerable\" (easiest to overcharge) and\r\ndiscriminating against and for certain types of\r\nconsumers.\r\n\"Consolidate\" the industry so as to \"overcome industry\r\nfragmentation\".\r\n\r\nThis arguments is highly successful with US federal\r\ncourts in the last decade. There is an intuitive feeling that\r\nfew is better and that a consolidated industry is bound to\r\nbe more efficient, better able to compete and to survive\r\nand, ultimately, better positioned to lower prices, to\r\nconduct costly research and development and to increase\r\nquality. In the words of Porter: \"(The) pay-off to\r\nconsolidating a fragmented industry can be high because...\r\nsmall and weak competitors offer little threat of\r\nretaliation\".\r\n\r\nTime one's own capacity additions; never sell old\r\ncapacity \"to anyone who will use it in the same\r\nindustry\" and buy out \"and retire competitors'\r\ncapacity\".\r\n\r\nA Note on the Spiteful Application of Competition Laws\r\nIn many developing countries and countries in transition\r\nfrom Communism to capitalism, competition laws are\r\nused to reward cronies or to damage opponents. The\r\ndiscriminatory and partial application of such laws and\r\nregulations sustains networks of patronage and cements\r\npolitical-economic alliances.\r\n\r\nThis abuse of the rule of Law and the regulatory regime is\r\nfurther compounded by the seething pathological envy\r\nthat is typical of erstwhile egalitarian societies now\r\nexposed to growing income inequalities. The mob,\r\nbusiness rivals, political parties, and the populace at large\r\nleverage competition laws to tear down businesses and\r\nhumiliate entrepreneurs whose success grates on their\r\nnerves and provokes their unbridled jealousy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX.  The Benefits of Oligopolies\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wall Street Journal has recently published an elegiac\r\nlist:\r\n\"Twenty years ago, cable television was dominated by a\r\npatchwork of thousands of tiny, family-operated\r\ncompanies. Today, a pending deal would leave three\r\ncompanies in control of nearly two-thirds of the market.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, three big publishers of college textbooks\r\naccounted for 35% of industry sales. Today they have\r\n62% ... Five titans dominate the (defense) industry, and\r\none of them, Northrop Grumman ... made a surprise\r\n(successful) $5.9 billion bid for (another) TRW ... In\r\n1996, when Congress deregulated telecommunications,\r\nthere were eight Baby Bells. Today there are four, and\r\ndozens of small rivals are dead. In 1999, more than 10\r\nsignificant firms offered help-wanted Web sites. Today,\r\nthree firms dominate\".\r\n\r\nMergers, business failures, deregulation, globalization,\r\ntechnology, dwindling and more cautious venture capital,\r\navaricious managers and investors out to increase share\r\nprices through a spree of often ill-thought acquisitions -\r\nall lead inexorably to the congealing of industries into a\r\nfew suppliers. Such market formations are known as\r\noligopolies. Oligopolies encourage customers to\r\ncollaborate in oligopsonies and these, in turn, foster\r\nfurther consolidation among suppliers, service providers,\r\nand manufacturers.\r\n\r\nMarket purists consider oligopolies - not to mention\r\ncartels - to be as villainous as monopolies. Oligopolies,\r\nthey intone, restrict competition unfairly, retard\r\ninnovation, charge rent and price their products higher\r\nthan they could have in a perfect competition free market\r\nwith multiple participants. Worse still, oligopolies are\r\ngoing global.\r\n\r\nBut how does one determine market concentration to start\r\nwith?\r\nThe Herfindahl-Hirschmann index squares the market\r\nshares of firms in the industry and adds up the total. But\r\nthe number of firms in a market does not necessarily\r\nimpart how low - or high - are barriers to entry. These are\r\ndetermined by the structure of the market, legal and\r\nbureaucratic hurdles, the existence, or lack thereof of\r\nfunctioning institutions, and by the possibility to turn an\r\nexcess profit.\r\n\r\nThe index suffers from other shortcomings. Often the\r\nmarket is difficult to define. Mergers do not always drive\r\nprices higher. University of Chicago economists studying\r\nIndustrial Organization - the branch of economics that\r\ndeals with competition - have long advocated a shift of\r\nemphasis from market share to - usually temporary -\r\nmarket power. Influential antitrust thinkers, such as\r\nRobert Bork, recommended to revise the law to focus\r\nsolely on consumer welfare.\r\n\r\nThese - and other insights - were incorporated in a theory\r\nof market contestability. Contrary to classical economic\r\nthinking, monopolies and oligopolies rarely raise prices\r\nfor fear of attracting new competitors, went the new\r\nschool. This is especially true in a \"contestable\" market -\r\nwhere entry is easy and cheap.\r\n\r\nAn Oligopolistic firm also fears the price-cutting reaction\r\nof its rivals if it reduces prices, goes the Hall, Hitch, and\r\nSweezy theory of the Kinked Demand Curve. If it were to\r\nraise prices, its rivals may not follow suit, thus\r\nundermining its market share. Stackleberg's amendments\r\nto Cournot's Competition model, on the other hand,\r\ndemonstrate the advantages to a price setter of being a\r\nfirst mover.\r\n\r\nIn \"Economic assessment of oligopolies under the\r\nCommunity Merger Control Regulation, in European\r\nCompetition law Review (Vol 4, Issue 3), Juan Briones\r\nAlonso writes:\r\n\"At first sight, it seems that ... oligopolists will sooner or\r\nlater find a way of avoiding competition among\r\nthemselves, since they are aware that their overall profits\r\nare maximized with this strategy. However, the question\r\nis much more complex. First of all, collusion without\r\nexplicit agreements is not easy to achieve. Each supplier\r\nmight have different views on the level of prices which\r\nthe demand would sustain, or might have different price\r\npreferences according to its cost conditions and market\r\nshare. A company might think it has certain advantages\r\nwhich its competitors do not have, and would perhaps\r\nperceive a conflict between maximising its own profits\r\nand maximizing industry profits.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if collusive strategies are implemented, and\r\noligopolists manage to raise prices significantly above\r\ntheir competitive level, each oligopolist will be confronted\r\nwith a conflict between sticking to the tacitly agreed\r\nbehaviour and increasing its individual profits by\r\n'cheating' on its competitors. Therefore, the question of\r\nmutual monitoring and control is a key issue in collusive\r\noligopolies\".\r\n\r\nMonopolies and oligopolies, went the contestability\r\ntheory, also refrain from restricting output, lest their\r\nmarket share be snatched by new entrants. In other words,\r\neven monopolists behave as though their market was fully\r\ncompetitive, their production and pricing decisions and\r\nactions constrained by the \"ghosts\" of potential and\r\nthreatening newcomers.\r\n\r\nIn a CRIEFF Discussion Paper titled \"From Walrasian\r\nOligopolies to Natural Monopoly - An Evolutionary\r\nModel of Market Structure\", the authors argue that:\r\n\"Under decreasing returns and some fixed cost, the market\r\ngrows to 'full capacity' at Walrasian equilibrium\r\n(oligopolies); on the other hand, if returns are increasing,\r\nthe unique long run outcome involves a profit-maximising\r\nmonopolist\".\r\n\r\nWhile intellectually tempting, contestability theory has\r\nlittle to do with the rough and tumble world of business.\r\n\r\nContestable markets simply do not exist. Entering a\r\nmarket is never cheap, nor easy. Huge sunk costs are\r\nrequired to counter the network effects of more veteran\r\nproducts as well as the competitors' brand recognition and\r\nability and inclination to collude to set prices.\r\n\r\nVictory is not guaranteed, losses loom constantly,\r\ninvestors are forever edgy, customers are fickle, bankers\r\nitchy, capital markets gloomy, suppliers beholden to the\r\ncompetition. Barriers to entry are almost always\r\nformidable and often insurmountable.\r\n\r\nIn the real world, tacit and implicit understandings\r\nregarding prices and competitive behavior prevail among\r\ncompetitors within oligopolies. Establishing a reputation\r\nfor collusive predatory pricing deters potential entrants.\r\n\r\nAnd a dominant position in one market can be leveraged\r\ninto another, connected or derivative, market.\r\n\r\nBut not everyone agrees. Ellis Hawley believed that\r\nindustries should be encouraged to grow because only size\r\nguarantees survival, lower prices, and innovation. Louis\r\nGalambos, a business historian at Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, published a 1994 paper titled \"The Triumph of\r\nOligopoly\". In it, he strove to explain why firms and\r\nmanagers - and even consumers - prefer oligopolies to\r\nboth monopolies and completely free markets with\r\nnumerous entrants.\r\n\r\nOligopolies, as opposed to monopolies, attract less\r\nattention from trustbusters. Quoted in the Wall Street\r\nJournal on March 8, 1999, Galambos wrote:\r\n\"Oligopolistic competition proved to be beneficial ...\r\nbecause it prevented ossification, ensuring that\r\nmanagements would keep their organizations innovative\r\nand efficient over the long run\".\r\n\r\nIn his recently published tome \"The Free-Market\r\nInnovation Machine - Analysing the Growth Miracle of\r\nCapitalism\", William Baumol of Princeton University,\r\nconcurs. He daringly argues that productive innovation is\r\nat its most prolific and qualitative in oligopolistic markets.\r\n\r\nBecause firms in an oligopoly characteristically charge\r\nabove-equilibrium (i.e., high) prices - the only way to\r\ncompete is through product differentiation. This is\r\nachieved by constant innovation - and by incessant\r\nadvertising.\r\n\r\nBaumol maintains that oligopolies are the real engines of\r\ngrowth and higher living standards and urges antitrust\r\nauthorities to leave them be. Lower regulatory costs,\r\neconomies of scale and of scope, excess profits due to the\r\nability to set prices in a less competitive market - allow\r\nfirms in an oligopoly to invest heavily in  research and\r\ndevelopment. A new drug costs c. $800 million to develop\r\nand get approved, according to Joseph DiMasi of Tufts\r\nUniversity's Center for the Study of Drug Development,\r\nquoted in The wall Street Journal.\r\n\r\nIn a paper titled \"If Cartels Were Legal, Would Firms Fix\r\nPrices\", implausibly published by the Antitrust Division\r\nof the US Department of Justice in 1997, Andrew Dick\r\ndemonstrated, counterintuitively, that cartels are more\r\nlikely to form in industries and sectors with many\r\nproducers. The more concentrated the industry - i.e., the\r\nmore oligopolistic it is - the less likely were cartels to\r\nemerge.\r\n\r\nCartels are conceived in order to cut members' costs of\r\nsales. Small firms are motivated to pool their purchasing\r\nand thus secure discounts. Dick draws attention to a\r\nparadox: mergers provoke the competitors of the merging\r\nfirms to complain. Why do they act this way?\r\nMergers and acquisitions enhance market concentration.\r\n\r\nAccording to conventional wisdom, the more concentrated\r\nthe industry, the higher the prices every producer or\r\nsupplier can charge. Why would anyone complain about\r\nbeing able to raise prices in a post-merger market?\r\nApparently, conventional wisdom is wrong. Market\r\nconcentration leads to price wars, to the great benefit of\r\nthe consumer. This is why firms find the mergers and\r\nacquisitions of their competitors worrisome. America's\r\nsoft drink market is ruled by two firms - Pepsi and Coca-\r\nCola. Yet, it has been the scene of ferocious price\r\ncompetition for decades.\r\n\"The Economist\", in its review of the paper, summed it up\r\nneatly:\r\n\"The story of America's export cartels suggests that when\r\nfirms decide to co-operate, rather than compete, they do\r\nnot always have price increases in mind. Sometimes, they\r\nget together simply in order to cut costs, which can be of\r\nbenefit to consumers\".\r\n\r\nThe very atom of antitrust thinking - the firm - has\r\nchanged in the last two decades. No longer hierarchical\r\nand rigid, business resembles self-assembling, nimble, ad-\r\nhoc networks of entrepreneurship superimposed on ever-\r\nshifting product groups and profit and loss centers.\r\n\r\nCompetition used to be extraneous to the firm - now it is\r\ncommonly an internal affair among autonomous units\r\nwithin a loose overall structure. This is how Jack\r\n\"neutron\" Welsh deliberately structured General Electric.\r\n\r\nAOL-Time Warner hosts many competing units, yet no\r\none ever instructs them either to curb this internecine\r\ncompetition, to stop cannibalizing each other, or to start\r\ncollaborating synergistically. The few mammoth agencies\r\nthat rule the world of advertising now host a clutch of\r\ncreative boutiques comfortably ensconced behind Chinese\r\nwalls. Such outfits often manage the accounts of\r\ncompetitors under the same corporate umbrella.\r\n\r\nMost firms act as intermediaries. They consume inputs,\r\nprocess them, and sell them as inputs to other firms. Thus,\r\nmany firms are concomitantly consumers, producers, and\r\nsuppliers. In a paper published last year and titled\r\n\"Productive Differentiation in Successive Vertical\r\nOligopolies\", that authors studied:\r\n\"An oligopoly model with two brands. Each downstream\r\nfirm chooses one brand to sell on a final market. The\r\nupstream firms specialize in the production of one input\r\nspecifically designed for the production of one brand, but\r\nthey also produce he input for the other brand at an extra\r\ncost. (They concluded that) when more downstream\r\nbrands choose one brand, more upstream firms will\r\nspecialize in the input specific to that brand, and vice\r\nversa. Hence, multiple equilibria are possible and the\r\nsoftening effect of brand differentiation on competition\r\nmight not be strong enough to induce maximal\r\ndifferentiation\" (and, thus, minimal competition).\r\n\r\nBoth scholars and laymen often mix their terms.\r\n\r\nCompetition does not necessarily translate either to\r\nvariety or to lower prices. Many consumers are turned off\r\nby too much choice. Lower prices sometimes deter\r\ncompetition and new entrants. A multiplicity of vendors,\r\nretail outlets, producers, or suppliers does not always\r\nfoster competition. And many products have umpteen\r\nsubstitutes. Consider films - cable TV, satellite, the\r\nInternet, cinemas, video rental shops, all offer the same\r\nservice: visual content delivery.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the issue of technological standards. It is\r\nincalculably easier to adopt a single worldwide or\r\nindustry-wide standard in an oligopolistic environment.\r\n\r\nStandards are known to decrease prices by cutting down\r\nR&D expenditures and systematizing components.\r\n\r\nOr, take innovation. It is used not only to differentiate\r\none's products from the competitors' - but to introduce\r\nnew generations and classes of products. Only firms with\r\na dominant market share have both the incentive and the\r\nwherewithal to invest in R&D and in subsequent branding\r\nand marketing.\r\n\r\nBut oligopolies in deregulated markets have sometimes\r\nsubstituted price fixing, extended intellectual property\r\nrights, and competitive restraint for market regulation.\r\n\r\nStill, Schumpeter believed in the faculty of  \"disruptive\r\ntechnologies\" and \"destructive creation\" to check the\r\npower of oligopolies to set extortionate prices, lower\r\ncustomer care standards, or inhibit competition.\r\n\r\nLinux threatens Windows. Opera nibbles at Microsoft's\r\nInternet Explorer. Amazon drubbed traditional\r\nbooksellers. eBay thrashes Amazon. Bell was forced by\r\nCovad Communications to implement its own technology,\r\nthe DSL broadband phone line.\r\n\r\nBarring criminal behavior, there is little that oligopolies\r\ncan do to defend themselves against these forces. They\r\ncan acquire innovative firms, intellectual property, and\r\ntalent. They can form strategic partnerships. But the\r\nsupply of innovators and new technologies is infinite - and\r\nthe resources of oligopolies, however mighty, are finite.\r\n\r\nThe market is stronger than any of its participants,\r\nregardless of the hubris of some, or the paranoia of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI. Anarchy as an Organizing Principle\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent spate of accounting fraud scandals signals the\r\nend of an era. Disillusionment and disenchantment with\r\nAmerican capitalism may yet lead to a tectonic\r\nideological shift from laissez faire and self regulation to\r\nstate intervention and regulation. This would be the\r\nreversal of a trend dating back to Thatcher in Britain and\r\nReagan in the USA. It would also cast some fundamental -\r\nand way more ancient - tenets of free-marketry in grave\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\nMarkets are perceived as self-organizing, self-assembling,\r\nexchanges of information, goods, and services. Adam\r\nSmith's \"invisible hand\" is the sum of all the mechanisms\r\nwhose interaction gives rise to the optimal allocation of\r\neconomic resources. The market's great advantages over\r\ncentral planning are precisely its randomness and its lack\r\nof self-awareness.\r\n\r\nMarket participants go about their egoistic business,\r\ntrying to maximize their utility, oblivious of the interests\r\nand action of all, bar those they interact with directly.\r\n\r\nSomehow, out of the chaos and clamor, a structure\r\nemerges of order and efficiency unmatched. Man is\r\nincapable of intentionally producing better outcomes.\r\n\r\nThus, any intervention and interference are deemed to be\r\ndetrimental to the proper functioning of the economy.\r\n\r\nIt is a minor step from this idealized worldview back to\r\nthe Physiocrats, who preceded Adam Smith, and who\r\npropounded the doctrine of \"laissez faire, laissez passer\" -\r\nthe hands-off battle cry. Theirs was a natural religion. The\r\nmarket, as an agglomeration of individuals, they\r\nthundered, was surely entitled to enjoy the rights and\r\nfreedoms accorded to each and every person. John Stuart\r\nMill weighed against the state's involvement in the\r\neconomy in his influential and exquisitely-timed\r\n\"Principles of Political Economy\", published in 1848.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by mounting evidence of market failures - for\r\ninstance to provide affordable and plentiful public goods -\r\nthis flawed theory returned with a vengeance in the last\r\ntwo decades of the past century. Privatization,\r\nderegulation, and self-regulation became faddish\r\nbuzzwords and part of a global consensus propagated by\r\nboth commercial banks and multilateral lenders.\r\n\r\nAs applied to the professions - to accountants, stock\r\nbrokers, lawyers, bankers, insurers, and so on - self-\r\nregulation was premised on the belief in long-term self-\r\npreservation. Rational economic players and moral agents\r\nare supposed to maximize their utility in the long-run by\r\nobserving the rules and regulations of a level playing\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThis noble propensity seemed, alas, to have been\r\ntampered by avarice and narcissism and by the immature\r\ninability to postpone gratification. Self-regulation failed\r\nso spectacularly to conquer human nature that its demise\r\ngave rise to the most intrusive statal stratagems ever\r\ndevised. In both the UK and the USA, the government is\r\nmuch more heavily and pervasively involved in the\r\nminutia of accountancy, stock dealing, and banking than it\r\nwas only two years ago.\r\n\r\nBut the ethos and myth of \"order out of chaos\" - with its\r\nproponents in the exact sciences as well - ran deeper than\r\nthat. The very culture of commerce was thoroughly\r\npermeated and transformed. It is not surprising that the\r\nInternet - a chaotic network with an anarchic modus\r\noperandi - flourished at these times.\r\n\r\nThe dotcom revolution was less about technology than\r\nabout new ways of doing business - mixing umpteen\r\nirreconcilable ingredients, stirring well, and hoping for the\r\nbest. No one, for instance, offered a linear revenue model\r\nof how to translate \"eyeballs\" - i.e., the number of visitors\r\nto a Web site - to money (\"monetizing\"). It was\r\ndogmatically held to be true that, miraculously, traffic - a\r\nchaotic phenomenon - will translate to profit - hitherto the\r\noutcome of painstaking labour.\r\n\r\nPrivatization itself was such a leap of faith. State owned\r\nassets - including utilities and suppliers of public goods\r\nsuch as health and education - were transferred wholesale\r\nto the hands of profit maximizers. The implicit belief was\r\nthat the price mechanism will provide the missing\r\nplanning and regulation. In other words, higher prices\r\nwere supposed to guarantee an uninterrupted service.\r\n\r\nPredictably, failure ensued - from electricity utilities in\r\nCalifornia to railway operators in Britain.\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous crumbling of these urban legends - the\r\nliberating power of the Net, the self-regulating markets,\r\nthe unbridled merits of privatization - inevitably gave rise\r\nto a backlash.\r\n\r\nThe state has acquired monstrous proportions in the\r\ndecades since the Second world War. It is about to grow\r\nfurther and to digest the few sectors hitherto left\r\nuntouched. To say the least, these are not good news. But\r\nwe libertarians - proponents of both individual freedom\r\nand individual responsibility - have brought it on\r\nourselves by thwarting the work of that invisible regulator\r\n- the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII. Narcissism in the Boardroom\r\n\r\n\r\nThe perpetrators of the recent spate of financial frauds in\r\nthe USA acted with callous disregard for both their\r\nemployees and shareholders - not to mention other\r\nstakeholders. Psychologists have often remote-diagnosed\r\nthem as \"malignant, pathological narcissists\".\r\n\r\nNarcissists are driven by the need to uphold and maintain\r\na false self - a concocted, grandiose, and demanding\r\npsychological construct typical of the narcissistic\r\npersonality disorder. The false self is projected to the\r\nworld in order to garner \"narcissistic supply\" - adulation,\r\nadmiration, or even notoriety and infamy. Any kind of\r\nattention is usually deemed by narcissists to be preferable\r\nto obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe false self is suffused with fantasies of perfection,\r\ngrandeur, brilliance, infallibility, immunity, significance,\r\nomnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience. To be a\r\nnarcissist is to be convinced of a great, inevitable personal\r\ndestiny. The narcissist is preoccupied with ideal love, the\r\nconstruction of brilliant, revolutionary scientific theories,\r\nthe composition or authoring or painting of the greatest\r\nwork of art, the founding of a new school of thought, the\r\nattainment of fabulous wealth, the reshaping of a nation or\r\na conglomerate, and so on. The narcissist never sets\r\nrealistic goals to himself. He is forever preoccupied with\r\nfantasies of uniqueness, record breaking, or breathtaking\r\nachievements. His verbosity reflects this propensity.\r\n\r\nReality is, naturally, quite different and this gives rise to a\r\n\"grandiosity gap\". The demands of the false self are never\r\nsatisfied by the narcissist's accomplishments, standing,\r\nwealth, clout, sexual prowess, or knowledge. The\r\nnarcissist's grandiosity and sense of entitlement are\r\nequally incommensurate with his achievements.\r\n\r\nTo bridge the grandiosity gap, the malignant\r\n(pathological) narcissist resorts to shortcuts. These very\r\noften lead to fraud.\r\n\r\nThe narcissist cares only about appearances. What matters\r\nto him are the facade of wealth and its attendant social\r\nstatus and narcissistic supply. Witness the travestied\r\nextravagance of Tyco's Denis Kozlowski. Media attention\r\nonly exacerbates the narcissist's addiction and makes it\r\nincumbent on him to go to ever-wilder extremes to secure\r\nuninterrupted supply from this source.\r\n\r\nThe narcissist lacks empathy - the ability to put himself in\r\nother people's shoes. He does not recognize boundaries -\r\npersonal, corporate, or legal. Everything and everyone are\r\nto him mere instruments, extensions, objects\r\nunconditionally and uncomplainingly available in his\r\npursuit of narcissistic gratification.\r\n\r\nThis makes the narcissist perniciously exploitative. He\r\nuses, abuses, devalues, and discards even his nearest and\r\ndearest in the most chilling manner. The narcissist is\r\nutility- driven, obsessed with his overwhelming need to\r\nreduce his anxiety and regulate his labile sense of self-\r\nworth by securing a constant supply of his drug -\r\nattention. American executives acted without\r\ncompunction when they raided their employees' pension\r\nfunds - as did Robert Maxwell a generation earlier in\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThe narcissist is convinced of his superiority - cerebral or\r\nphysical. To his mind, he is a Gulliver hamstrung by a\r\nhorde of narrow-minded and envious Lilliputians. The\r\ndotcom \"new economy\" was infested with \"visionaries\"\r\nwith a contemptuous attitude towards the mundane:\r\nprofits, business cycles, conservative economists, doubtful\r\njournalists, and cautious analysts.\r\n\r\nYet, deep inside, the narcissist is painfully aware of his\r\naddiction to others - their attention, admiration, applause,\r\nand affirmation. He despises himself for being thus\r\ndependent. He hates people the same way a drug addict\r\nhates his pusher. He wishes to \"put them in their place\",\r\nhumiliate them, demonstrate to them how inadequate and\r\nimperfect they are in comparison to his regal self and how\r\nlittle he craves or needs them.\r\n\r\nThe narcissist regards himself as one would an expensive\r\npresent, a gift to his company, to his family, to his\r\nneighbours, to his colleagues, to his country. This firm\r\nconviction of his inflated importance makes him feel\r\nentitled to special treatment, special favors, special\r\noutcomes, concessions, subservience, immediate\r\ngratification, obsequiousness, and lenience. It also makes\r\nhim feel immune to mortal laws and somehow divinely\r\nprotected and insulated from the inevitable consequences\r\nof his deeds and misdeeds.\r\n\r\nThe self-destructive narcissist plays the role of the \"bad\r\nguy\" (or \"bad girl\"). But even this is within the traditional\r\nsocial roles cartoonishly exaggerated by the narcissist to\r\nattract attention. Men are likely to emphasise intellect,\r\npower, aggression, money, or social status. Narcissistic\r\nwomen are likely to emphasise body, looks, charm,\r\nsexuality, feminine \"traits\", homemaking, children and\r\nchildrearing.\r\n\r\nPunishing the wayward narcissist is a veritable catch-22.\r\n\r\nA jail term is useless as a deterrent if it only serves to\r\nfocus attention on the narcissist. Being infamous is second\r\nbest to being famous - and far preferable to being ignored.\r\n\r\nThe only way to effectively punish a narcissist is to\r\nwithhold narcissistic supply from him and thus to prevent\r\nhim from becoming a notorious celebrity.\r\n\r\nGiven a sufficient amount of media exposure, book\r\ncontracts, talk shows, lectures, and public attention - the\r\nnarcissist may even consider the whole grisly affair to be\r\nemotionally rewarding. To the narcissist, freedom, wealth,\r\nsocial status, family, vocation - are all means to an end.\r\n\r\nAnd the end is attention. If he can secure attention by\r\nbeing the big bad wolf - the narcissist unhesitatingly\r\ntransforms himself into one. Lord Archer, for instance,\r\nseems to be positively basking in the media circus\r\nprovoked by his prison diaries.\r\n\r\nThe narcissist does not victimise, plunder, terrorise and\r\nabuse others in a cold, calculating manner. He does so\r\noffhandedly, as a manifestation of his genuine character.\r\n\r\nTo be truly \"guilty\" one needs to intend, to deliberate, to\r\ncontemplate one's choices and then to choose one's acts.\r\n\r\nThe narcissist does none of these.\r\n\r\nThus, punishment breeds in him surprise, hurt and\r\nseething anger. The narcissist is stunned by society's\r\ninsistence that he should be held accountable for his deeds\r\nand penalized accordingly. He feels wronged, baffled,\r\ninjured, the victim of bias, discrimination and injustice.\r\n\r\nHe rebels and rages.\r\n\r\nDepending upon the pervasiveness of his magical\r\nthinking, the narcissist may feel besieged by\r\noverwhelming powers, forces cosmic and intrinsically\r\nominous. He may develop compulsive rites to fend off\r\nthis \"bad\", unwarranted, persecutory influences.\r\n\r\nThe narcissist, very much the infantile outcome of stunted\r\npersonal development, engages in magical thinking. He\r\nfeels omnipotent, that there is nothing he couldn't do or\r\nachieve if only he sets his mind to it. He feels omniscient -\r\nhe rarely admits to ignorance and regards his intuitions\r\nand intellect as founts of objective data.\r\n\r\nThus, narcissists are haughtily convinced that\r\nintrospection is a more important and more efficient (not\r\nto mention easier to accomplish) method of obtaining\r\nknowledge than the systematic study of outside sources of\r\ninformation in accordance with strict and tedious\r\ncurricula. Narcissists are \"inspired\" and they despise\r\nhamstrung technocrats.\r\n\r\nTo some extent, they feel omnipresent because they are\r\neither famous or about to become famous or because their\r\nproduct is selling or is being manufactured globally.\r\n\r\nDeeply immersed in their delusions of grandeur, they\r\nfirmly believe that their acts have - or will have - a great\r\ninfluence not only on their firm, but on their country, or\r\neven on Mankind. Having mastered the manipulation of\r\ntheir human environment - they are convinced that they\r\nwill always \"get away with it\". They develop hubris and a\r\nfalse sense of immunity.\r\n\r\nNarcissistic immunity is the (erroneous) feeling,\r\nharboured by the narcissist, that he is impervious to the\r\nconsequences of his actions, that he will never be effected\r\nby the results of his own decisions, opinions, beliefs,\r\ndeeds and misdeeds, acts, inaction, or membership of\r\ncertain groups, that he is above reproach and punishment,\r\nthat, magically, he is protected and will miraculously be\r\nsaved at the last moment. Hence the audacity, simplicity,\r\nand transparency of some of the fraud and corporate\r\nlooting in the 1990's. Narcissists rarely bother to cover\r\ntheir traces, so great is their disdain and conviction that\r\nthey are above mortal laws and wherewithal.\r\n\r\nWhat are the sources of this unrealistic appraisal of\r\nsituations and events?\r\nThe false self is a childish response to abuse and trauma.\r\n\r\nAbuse is not limited to sexual molestation or beatings.\r\n\r\nSmothering, doting, pampering, over-indulgence, treating\r\nthe child as an extension of the parent, not respecting the\r\nchild's boundaries, and burdening the child with excessive\r\nexpectations are also forms of abuse.\r\n\r\nThe child reacts by constructing false self that is\r\npossessed of everything it needs in order to prevail:\r\nunlimited and instantaneously available Harry Potter-like\r\npowers and wisdom. The false self, this Superman, is\r\nindifferent to abuse and punishment. This way, the child's\r\ntrue self is shielded from the toddler's harsh reality.\r\n\r\nThis artificial, maladaptive separation between a\r\nvulnerable (but not punishable) true self and a punishable\r\n(but invulnerable) false self is an effective mechanism. It\r\nisolates the child from the unjust, capricious, emotionally\r\ndangerous world that he occupies. But, at the same time, it\r\nfosters in him a false sense of \"nothing can happen to me,\r\nbecause I am not here, I am not available to be punished,\r\nhence I am immune to punishment\".\r\n\r\nThe comfort of false immunity is also yielded by the\r\nnarcissist's sense of entitlement. In his grandiose\r\ndelusions, the narcissist is sui generis, a gift to humanity,\r\na precious, fragile, object. Moreover, the narcissist is\r\nconvinced both that this uniqueness is immediately\r\ndiscernible - and that it gives him special rights. The\r\nnarcissist feels that he is protected by some cosmological\r\nlaw pertaining to \"endangered species\".\r\n\r\nHe is convinced that his future contribution to others - his\r\nfirm, his country, humanity - should and does exempt him\r\nfrom the mundane: daily chores, boring jobs, recurrent\r\ntasks, personal exertion, orderly investment of resources\r\nand efforts, laws and regulations, social conventions, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nThe narcissist is entitled to a \"special treatment\": high\r\nliving standards, constant and immediate catering to his\r\nneeds, the eradication of any friction with the humdrum\r\nand the routine, an all-engulfing absolution of his sins,\r\nfast track privileges (to higher education, or in his\r\nencounters with bureaucracies, for instance). Punishment,\r\ntrusts the narcissist, is for ordinary people, where no great\r\nloss to humanity is involved.\r\n\r\nNarcissists are possessed of inordinate abilities to charm,\r\nto convince, to seduce, and to persuade. Many of them are\r\ngifted orators and intellectually endowed. Many of them\r\nwork in in politics, the media, fashion, show business, the\r\narts, medicine, or business, and serve as religious leaders.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of their standing in the community, their\r\ncharisma, or their ability to find the willing scapegoats,\r\nthey do get exempted many times. Having recurrently\r\n\"got away with it\" - they develop a theory of personal\r\nimmunity, founded upon some kind of societal and even\r\ncosmic \"order\" in which certain people are above\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nBut there is a fourth, simpler, explanation. The narcissist\r\nlacks self-awareness. Divorced from his true self, unable\r\nto empathise (to understand what it is like to be someone\r\nelse), unwilling to constrain his actions to cater to the\r\nfeelings and needs of others - the narcissist is in a constant\r\ndreamlike state.\r\n\r\nTo the narcissist, his life is unreal, like watching an\r\nautonomously unfolding movie. The narcissist is a mere\r\nspectator, mildly interested, greatly entertained at times.\r\n\r\nHe does not \"own\" his actions. He, therefore, cannot\r\nunderstand why he should be punished and when he is, he\r\nfeels grossly wronged.\r\n\r\nSo convinced is the narcissist that he is destined to great\r\nthings - that he refuses to accept setbacks, failures and\r\npunishments. He regards them as temporary, as the\r\noutcomes of someone else's errors, as part of the future\r\nmythology of his rise to power/brilliance/wealth/ideal\r\nlove, etc. Being punished is a diversion of his precious\r\nenergy and resources from the all-important task of\r\nfulfilling his mission in life.\r\n\r\nThe narcissist is pathologically envious of people and\r\nbelieves that they are equally envious of him. He is\r\nparanoid, on guard, ready to fend off an imminent attack.\r\n\r\nA punishment to the narcissist is a major surprise and a\r\nnuisance but it also validates his suspicion that he is being\r\npersecuted. It proves to him that strong forces are arrayed\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nHe tells himself that people, envious of his achievements\r\nand humiliated by them, are out to get him. He constitutes\r\na threat to the accepted order. When required to pay for\r\nhis misdeeds, the narcissist is always disdainful and bitter\r\nand feels misunderstood by his inferiors.\r\n\r\nCooked books, corporate fraud, bending the (GAAP or\r\nother) rules, sweeping problems under the carpet, over-\r\npromising, making grandiose claims (the \"vision thing\") -\r\nare hallmarks of a narcissist in action. When social cues\r\nand norms encourage such behaviour rather than inhibit it\r\n- in other words, when such behaviour elicits abundant\r\nnarcissistic supply - the pattern is reinforced and become\r\nentrenched and rigid. Even when circumstances change,\r\nthe narcissist finds it difficult to adapt, shed his routines,\r\nand replace them with new ones. He is trapped in his past\r\nsuccess. He becomes a swindler.\r\n\r\nBut pathological narcissism is not an isolated\r\nphenomenon. It is embedded in our contemporary culture.\r\n\r\nThe West's is a narcissistic civilization. It upholds\r\nnarcissistic values and penalizes alternative value-\r\nsystems. From an early age, children are taught to avoid\r\nself-criticism, to deceive themselves regarding their\r\ncapacities and attainments, to feel entitled, and to exploit\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nAs Lilian Katz observed in her important paper,\r\n\"Distinctions between Self-Esteem and Narcissism:\r\nImplications for Practice\", published by the Educational\r\nResources Information Center, the line between enhancing\r\nself-esteem and fostering narcissism is often blurred by\r\neducators and parents.\r\n\r\nBoth Christopher Lasch in \"The Culture of Narcissism\"\r\nand Theodore Millon in his books about personality\r\ndisorders, singled out American society as narcissistic.\r\n\r\nLitigiousness may be the flip side of an inane sense of\r\nentitlement. Consumerism is built on this common and\r\ncommunal lie of \"I can do anything I want and possess\r\neverything I desire if I only apply myself to it\" and on the\r\npathological envy it fosters.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, narcissistic disorders are more common\r\namong men than among women. This may be because\r\nnarcissism conforms to masculine social mores and to the\r\nprevailing ethos of capitalism. Ambition, achievements,\r\nhierarchy, ruthlessness, drive - are both social values and\r\nnarcissistic male traits. Social thinkers like the\r\naforementioned Lasch speculated that modern American\r\nculture - a self-centred one - increases the rate of\r\nincidence of the narcissistic personality disorder.\r\n\r\nOtto Kernberg, a notable scholar of personality disorders,\r\nconfirmed Lasch's intuition: \"Society can make serious\r\npsychological abnormalities, which already exist in some\r\npercentage of the population, seem to be at least\r\nsuperficially appropriate\".\r\n\r\nIn their book \"Personality Disorders in Modern Life\",\r\nTheodore Millon and Roger Davis state, as a matter of\r\nfact, that pathological narcissism was once the preserve of\r\n\"the royal and the wealthy\" and that it \"seems to have\r\ngained prominence only in the late twentieth century\".\r\n\r\nNarcissism, according to them, may be associated with\r\n\"higher levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs ...\r\n\r\nIndividuals in less advantaged nations .. are too busy\r\ntrying (to survive) ... to be arrogant and grandiose\".\r\n\r\nThey - like Lasch before them - attribute pathological\r\nnarcissism to \"a society that stresses individualism and\r\nself-gratification at the expense of community, namely the\r\nUnited States.\" They assert that the disorder is more\r\nprevalent among certain professions with \"star power\" or\r\nrespect. \"In an individualistic culture, the narcissist is\r\n'God's gift to the world'. In a collectivist society, the\r\nnarcissist is 'God's gift to the collective\".\r\n\r\nMillon quotes Warren and Caponi's \"The Role of Culture\r\nin the Development of Narcissistic Personality Disorders\r\nin America, Japan and Denmark\":\r\n\"Individualistic narcissistic structures of self-regard (in\r\nindividualistic societies) ... are rather self-contained and\r\nindependent ... (In collectivist cultures) narcissistic\r\nconfigurations of the we-self ... denote self-esteem\r\nderived from strong identification with the reputation and\r\nhonor of the family, groups, and others in hierarchical\r\nrelationships\".\r\n\r\nStill, there are malignant narcissists among subsistence\r\nfarmers in Africa, nomads in the Sinai desert, day laborers\r\nin east Europe, and intellectuals and socialites in\r\nManhattan. Malignant narcissism is all-pervasive and\r\nindependent of culture and society. It is true, though, that\r\nthe way pathological narcissism manifests and is\r\nexperienced is dependent on the particulars of societies\r\nand cultures.\r\n\r\nIn some cultures, it is encouraged, in others suppressed. In\r\nsome societies it is channeled against minorities - in\r\nothers it is tainted with paranoia. In collectivist societies,\r\nit may be projected onto the collective, in individualistic\r\nsocieties, it is an individual's trait.\r\n\r\nYet, can families, organizations, ethnic groups, churches,\r\nand even whole nations be safely described as\r\n\"narcissistic\" or \"pathologically self-absorbed\"? Can we\r\ntalk about a \"corporate culture of narcissism\"?\r\nHuman collectives - states, firms, households, institutions,\r\npolitical parties, cliques, bands - acquire a life and a\r\ncharacter all their own. The longer the association or\r\naffiliation of the members, the more cohesive and\r\nconformist the inner dynamics of the group, the more\r\npersecutory or numerous its enemies, competitors, or\r\nadversaries, the more intensive the physical and emotional\r\nexperiences of the individuals it is comprised of, the\r\nstronger the bonds of locale, language, and history - the\r\nmore rigorous might an assertion of a common pathology\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nSuch an all-pervasive and extensive pathology manifests\r\nitself in the behavior of each and every member. It is a\r\ndefining - though often implicit or underlying - mental\r\nstructure. It has explanatory and predictive powers. It is\r\nrecurrent and invariable - a pattern of conduct melding\r\ndistorted cognition and stunted emotions. And it is often\r\nvehemently denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII. The Revolt of the Poor\r\n\r\nThe Demise of Intellectual Property?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1997, I published a book of short stories in Israel. The\r\npublishing house belongs to Israel's leading (and\r\nexceedingly wealthy) newspaper. I signed a contract\r\nwhich stated that I am entitled to receive 8% of the\r\nincome from the sales of the book after commissions\r\npayable to distributors, shops, etc. A few months later\r\n(1997), I won the coveted Prize of the Ministry of\r\nEducation (for short prose). The prize money (a few\r\nthousand DMs) was snatched by the publishing house on\r\nthe legal grounds that all the money generated by the book\r\nbelongs to them because they own the copyright.\r\n\r\nIn the mythology generated by capitalism to pacify the\r\nmasses, the myth of intellectual property stands out. It\r\ngoes like this: if the rights to intellectual property were\r\nnot defined and enforced, commercial entrepreneurs\r\nwould not have taken on the risks associated with\r\npublishing books, recording records, and preparing\r\nmultimedia products. As a result, creative people will\r\nhave suffered because they will have found no way to\r\nmake their works accessible to the public. Ultimately, it is\r\nthe public which pays the price of piracy, goes the refrain.\r\n\r\nBut this is factually untrue. In the USA there is a very\r\nlimited group of authors who actually live by their pen.\r\n\r\nOnly select musicians eke out a living from their noisy\r\nvocation (most of them rock stars who own their labels -\r\nGeorge Michael had to fight Sony to do just that) and very\r\nfew actors come close to deriving subsistence level\r\nincome from their profession. All these can no longer be\r\nthought of as mostly creative people. Forced to defend\r\ntheir intellectual property rights and the interests of Big\r\nMoney, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Schwarzenegger and\r\nGrisham are businessmen at least as much as they are\r\nartists.\r\n\r\nEconomically and rationally, we should expect that the\r\ncostlier a work of art is to produce and the narrower its\r\nmarket - the more emphasized its intellectual property\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nConsider a publishing house.\r\n\r\nA book which costs 50,000 DM to produce with a\r\npotential audience of 1000 purchasers (certain academic\r\ntexts are like this) - would have to be priced at a a\r\nminimum of 100 DM to recoup only the direct costs. If\r\nillegally copied (thereby shrinking the potential market as\r\nsome people will prefer to buy the cheaper illegal copies)\r\n- its price would have to go up prohibitively to recoup\r\ncosts, thus driving out potential buyers. The story is\r\ndifferent if a book costs 10,000 DM to produce and is\r\npriced at 20 DM a copy with a potential readership of\r\n1,000,000 readers. Piracy (illegal copying) should in this\r\ncase be more readily tolerated as a marginal phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThis is the theory. But the facts are tellingly different. The\r\nless the cost of production (brought down by digital\r\ntechnologies) - the fiercer the battle against piracy. The\r\nbigger the market - the more pressure is applied to clamp\r\ndown on samizdat entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nGovernments, from China to Macedonia, are introducing\r\nintellectual property laws (under pressure from rich world\r\ncountries) and enforcing them belatedly. But where one\r\nfactory is closed on shore (as has been the case in\r\nmainland China) - two sprout off shore (as is the case in\r\nHong Kong and in Bulgaria).\r\n\r\nBut this defies logic: the market today is global, the costs\r\nof production are lower (with the exception of the music\r\nand film industries), the marketing channels more\r\nnumerous (half of the income of movie studios emanates\r\nfrom video cassette sales), the speedy recouping of the\r\ninvestment virtually guaranteed. Moreover, piracy thrives\r\nin very poor markets in which the population would\r\nanyhow not have paid the legal price. The illegal product\r\nis inferior to the legal copy (it comes with no literature,\r\nwarranties or support). So why should the big\r\nmanufacturers, publishing houses, record companies,\r\nsoftware companies and fashion houses worry?\r\nThe answer lurks in history. Intellectual property is a\r\nrelatively new notion. In the near past, no one considered\r\nknowledge or the fruits of creativity (art, design) as\r\n\"patentable\", or as someone's \"property\". The artist was\r\nbut a mere channel through which divine grace flowed.\r\n\r\nTexts, discoveries, inventions, works of art and music,\r\ndesigns - all belonged to the community and could be\r\nreplicated freely. True, the chosen ones, the conduits,\r\nwere honoured but were rarely financially rewarded. They\r\nwere commissioned to produce their works of art and\r\nwere salaried, in most cases. Only with the advent of the\r\nIndustrial Revolution were the embryonic precursors of\r\nintellectual property introduced but they were still limited\r\nto industrial designs and processes, mainly as embedded\r\nin machinery. The patent was born. The more massive the\r\nmarket, the more sophisticated the sales and marketing\r\ntechniques, the bigger the financial stakes - the larger\r\nloomed the issue of intellectual property. It spread from\r\nmachinery to designs, processes, books, newspapers, any\r\nprinted matter, works of art and music, films (which, at\r\ntheir beginning were not considered art), software,\r\nsoftware embedded in hardware, processes, business\r\nmethods, and even unto genetic material.\r\n\r\nIntellectual property rights - despite their noble title - are\r\nless about the intellect and more about property. This is\r\nBig Money: the markets in intellectual property outweigh\r\nthe total industrial production in the world. The aim is to\r\nsecure a monopoly on a specific work. This is an\r\nespecially grave matter in academic publishing where\r\nsmall- circulation magazines do not allow their content to\r\nbe quoted or published even for non-commercial\r\npurposes. The monopolists of knowledge and intellectual\r\nproducts cannot allow competition anywhere in the world\r\n- because theirs is a world market. A pirate in Skopje is in\r\ndirect competition with Bill Gates. When he sells a pirated\r\nMicrosoft product - he is depriving Microsoft not only of\r\nits income, but of a client (=future income), of its\r\nmonopolistic status (cheap copies can be smuggled into\r\nother markets), and of its competition-deterring image (a\r\nmajor monopoly preserving asset). This is a threat which\r\nMicrosoft cannot tolerate. Hence its efforts to eradicate\r\npiracy - successful in China and an utter failure in legally-\r\nrelaxed Russia.\r\n\r\nBut what Microsoft fails to understand is that the problem\r\nlies with its pricing policy - not with the pirates. When\r\nfaced with a global marketplace, a company can adopt one\r\nof two policies: either to adjust the price of its products to\r\na world average of purchasing power - or to use\r\ndiscretionary differential pricing (as pharmaceutical\r\ncompanies were forced to do in Brazil and South Africa).\r\n\r\nA Macedonian with an average monthly income of 160\r\nUSD clearly cannot afford to buy the Encyclopaedia\r\nEncarta Deluxe. In America, 50 USD is the income\r\ngenerated in 4 hours of an average job. In Macedonian\r\nterms, therefore, the Encarta is 20 times more expensive.\r\n\r\nEither the price should be lowered in the Macedonian\r\nmarket - or an average world price should be fixed which\r\nwill reflect an average global purchasing power.\r\n\r\nSomething must be done about it not only from the\r\neconomic point of view. Intellectual products are very\r\nprice sensitive and highly elastic. Lower prices will be\r\nmore than compensated for by a much higher sales\r\nvolume. There is no other way to explain the pirate\r\nindustries: evidently, at the right price a lot of people are\r\nwilling to buy these products. High prices are an implicit\r\ntrade-off favouring small, elite, select, rich world\r\nclientele. This raises a moral issue: are the children of\r\nMacedonia less worthy of education and access to the\r\nlatest in human knowledge and creation?\r\nTwo developments threaten the future of intellectual\r\nproperty rights. One is the Internet. Academics, fed up\r\nwith the monopolistic practices of professional\r\npublications - already publish on the web in big numbers.\r\n\r\nI published a few book on the Internet and they can be\r\nfreely downloaded by anyone who has a computer or a\r\nmodem. The full text of electronic magazines, trade\r\njournals, billboards, professional publications, and\r\nthousands of books is available online. Hackers even\r\nmade sites available from which it is possible to download\r\nwhole software and multimedia products. It is very easy\r\nand cheap to publish on the Internet, the barriers to entry\r\nare virtually nil. Web pages are hosted free of charge, and\r\nauthoring and publishing software tools are incorporated\r\nin most word processors and browser applications. As the\r\nInternet acquires more impressive sound and video\r\ncapabilities it will proceed to threaten the monopoly of the\r\nrecord companies, the movie studios and so on.\r\n\r\nThe second development is also technological. The oft-\r\nvindicated Moore's law predicts the doubling of computer\r\nmemory capacity every 18 months. But memory is only\r\none aspect of computing power. Another is the rapid\r\nsimultaneous advance on all technological fronts.\r\n\r\nMiniaturization and concurrent empowerment by software\r\ntools have made it possible for individuals to emulate\r\nmuch larger scale organizations successfully. A single\r\nperson, sitting at home with 5000 USD worth of\r\nequipment can fully compete with the best products of the\r\nbest printing houses anywhere. CD-ROMs can be written\r\non, stamped and copied in house. A complete music\r\nstudio with the latest in digital technology has been\r\ncondensed to the dimensions of a single chip. This will\r\nlead to personal publishing, personal music recording, and\r\nthe to the digitization of plastic art. But this is only one\r\nside of the story.\r\n\r\nThe relative advantage of the intellectual property\r\ncorporation does not consist exclusively in its\r\ntechnological prowess. Rather it lies in its vast pool of\r\ncapital, its marketing clout, market positioning, sales\r\norganization, and distribution network.\r\n\r\nNowadays, anyone can print a visually impressive book,\r\nusing the above-mentioned cheap equipment. But in an\r\nage of information glut, it is the marketing, the media\r\ncampaign, the distribution, and the sales that determine\r\nthe economic outcome.\r\n\r\nThis advantage, however, is also being eroded.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is a psychological shift, a reaction to the\r\ncommercialization of intellect and spirit. Creative people\r\nare repelled by what they regard as an oligarchic\r\nestablishment of institutionalized, lowest common\r\ndenominator art and they are fighting back.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the Internet is a huge (200 million people), truly\r\ncosmopolitan market, with its own marketing channels\r\nfreely available to all. Even by default, with a minimum\r\ninvestment, the likelihood of being seen by surprisingly\r\nlarge numbers of consumers is high.\r\n\r\nI published one book the traditional way - and another on\r\nthe Internet. In 50 months, I have received 6500 written\r\nresponses regarding my electronic book. Well over\r\n500,000 people read it (my Link Exchange meter\r\nregistered c. 2,000,000 impressions since November\r\n1998). It is a textbook (in psychopathology) - and 500,000\r\nreaders is a lot for this kind of publication. I am so\r\nsatisfied that I am not sure that I will ever consider a\r\ntraditional publisher again. Indeed, my last book was\r\npublished in the very same way.\r\n\r\nThe demise of intellectual property has lately become\r\nabundantly clear. The old intellectual property industries\r\nare fighting tooth and nail to preserve their monopolies\r\n(patents, trademarks, copyright) and their cost advantages\r\nin manufacturing and marketing.\r\n\r\nBut they are faced with three inexorable processes which\r\nare likely to render their efforts vain:\r\nThe Newspaper Packaging\r\nPrint newspapers offer package deals of cheap content\r\nsubsidized by advertising. In other words, the advertisers\r\npay for content formation and generation and the reader\r\nhas no choice but be exposed to commercial messages as\r\nhe or she studies the content.\r\n\r\nThis model - adopted earlier by radio and television -\r\nrules the internet now and will rule the wireless internet in\r\nthe future. Content will be made available free of all\r\npecuniary charges. The consumer will pay by providing\r\nhis personal data (demographic data, consumption\r\npatterns and preferences and so on) and by being exposed\r\nto advertising. Subscription based models are bound to\r\nfail.\r\n\r\nThus, content creators will benefit only by sharing in the\r\nadvertising cake. They will find it increasingly difficult to\r\nimplement the old models of royalties paid for access or\r\nof ownership of intellectual property.\r\n\r\nDisintermediation\r\nA lot of ink has been spilt regarding this important trend.\r\n\r\nThe removal of layers of brokering and intermediation -\r\nmainly on the manufacturing and marketing levels - is a\r\nhistoric development (though the continuation of a long\r\nterm trend).\r\n\r\nConsider music for instance. Streaming audio on the\r\ninternet or downloadable MP3 files will render the CD\r\nobsolete. The internet also provides a venue for the\r\nmarketing of niche products and reduces the barriers to\r\nentry previously imposed by the need to engage in costly\r\nmarketing (\"branding\") campaigns and manufacturing\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nThis trend is also likely to restore the balance between\r\nartist and the commercial exploiters of his product. The\r\nvery definition of \"artist\" will expand to include all\r\ncreative people. One will seek to distinguish oneself, to\r\n\"brand\" oneself and to auction off one's services, ideas,\r\nproducts, designs, experience, etc. This is a return to pre-\r\nindustrial times when artisans ruled the economic scene.\r\n\r\nWork stability will vanish and work mobility will increase\r\nin a landscape of shifting allegiances, head hunting,\r\nremote collaboration and similar labour market trends.\r\n\r\nMarket Fragmentation\r\nIn a fragmented market with a myriad of mutually\r\nexclusive market niches, consumer preferences and\r\nmarketing and sales channels - economies of scale in\r\nmanufacturing and distribution are meaningless.\r\n\r\nNarrowcasting replaces broadcasting, mass customization\r\nreplaces mass production, a network of shifting\r\naffiliations replaces the rigid owned-branch system. The\r\ndecentralized, intrapreneurship-based corporation is a late\r\nresponse to these trends. The mega-corporation of the\r\nfuture is more likely to act as a collective of start-ups than\r\nas a homogeneous, uniform (and, to conspiracy theorists,\r\nsinister) juggernaut it once was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV. The Kidnapping of Content\r\n\r\nhttp://www.plagiarism.org and http://www.Turnitin.com\r\n\r\n\r\nLatin kidnapped the word \"plagion\" from ancient Greek\r\nand it ended up in English as \"plagiarism\". It literally\r\nmeans \"to kidnap\" - most commonly, to misappropriate\r\ncontent and wrongly attribute it to oneself. It is a close kin\r\nof piracy. But while the software or content pirate does\r\nnot bother to hide or alter the identity of the content's\r\ncreator or the software's author - the plagiarist does.\r\n\r\nPlagiarism is, therefore, more pernicious than piracy.\r\n\r\nEnter Turnit.com. An off-shoot of  www.iparadigms.com,\r\nit was established by a group of concerned (and\r\ncommercially minded) scientists from UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\nWhereas digital rights and asset management systems are\r\ngeared to prevent piracy - plagiarism.org and its\r\ncommercial arm, Turnit.com, are the cyber equivalent of a\r\nlaw enforcement agency, acting after the fact to discover\r\nthe culprits and uncover their misdeeds. This, they claim,\r\nis a first stage on the way to a plagiarism-free Internet-\r\nbased academic community of both teachers and students,\r\nin which the educational potential of the Internet can be\r\nfully realized.\r\n\r\nThe problem is especially severe in academia. Various\r\nsurveys have discovered that a staggering 80%(!) of US\r\nstudents cheat and that at least 30% plagiarize written\r\nmaterial. The Internet only exacerbated this problem.\r\n\r\nMore than 200 cheat-sites have sprung up, with thousands\r\nof papers available on-line and tens of thousands of\r\nsatisfied plagiarists the world over. Some of these hubs -\r\nlike cheater.com, cheatweb or cheathouse.com - make no\r\nbones about their offerings. Many of them are located\r\noutside the USA (in Germany, or Asia) and at least one\r\noffers papers in a few languages, Hebrew included.\r\n\r\nThe problem, though, is not limited to the ivory towers. E-\r\nzines plagiarize. The print media plagiarize. Individual\r\njournalists plagiarize, many with abandon. Even\r\nadvertising agencies and financial institutions plagiarize.\r\n\r\nThe amount of material out there is so overwhelming that\r\nthe plagiarist develops a (fairly justified) sense of\r\nimmunity. The temptation is irresistible, the rewards big\r\nand the pressures of modern life great.\r\n\r\nSome of the plagiarists are straightforward copiers. Others\r\nsubstitute words, add sentences, or combine two or more\r\nsources. This raises the question: \"when should content be\r\nconsidered original and when - plagiarized?\". Should the\r\ntest for plagiarism be more stringent than the one applied\r\nby the Copyright Office? And what rights are implicitly\r\ngranted by the material's genuine authors or publishers\r\nonce they place the content on the Internet? Is the Web a\r\npublic domain and, if yes, to what extent? These questions\r\nare not easily answered. Consider reports generated by\r\nusers from a database. Are these reports copyrighted - and\r\nif so, by whom - by the database compiler or by the user\r\nwho defined the parameters, without which the reports in\r\nquestion would have never been generated? What about\r\n\"fair use\" of text and works of art? In the USA, the\r\nbacklash against digital content piracy and plagiarism has\r\nreached preposterous legal, litigious and technological\r\nnadirs.\r\n\r\nPlagiarism.org has developed a statistics-based\r\ntechnology (the \"Document Source Analysis\") which\r\ncreates a \"digital fingerprint\" of every document in its\r\ndatabase. Web crawlers are then unleashed to scour the\r\nInternet and find documents with the same fingerprint and\r\na colour-coded report is generated. An instructor, teacher,\r\nor professor can then use the report to prove plagiarism\r\nand cheating.\r\n\r\nPiracy is often considered to be a form of viral marketing\r\n(even by software developers and publishers). The\r\nauthor's, publisher's, or software house's data are\r\npreserved intact in the cracked copy. Pirated copies of e-\r\nbooks often contribute to increased sales of the print\r\nversions. Crippled versions of software or pirated copies\r\nof software without its manuals, updates and support -\r\noften lead to the purchase of a licence. Not so with\r\nplagiarism. The identities of the author, editor, publisher\r\nand illustrator are deleted and replaced by the details of\r\nthe plagiarist. And while piracy is discussed freely and\r\nfought vigorously - the discussion of plagiarism is still\r\ntaboo and actively suppressed by image-conscious and\r\nendowment-weary academic institutions and media. It is\r\nan uphill struggle but plagiarism.org has taken the first\r\nresolute step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV. The Economics of Spam\r\n\r\n\r\nTennessee resident K. C. \"Khan\" Smith owes the internet\r\nservice provider EarthLink $24 million. According to the\r\nCNN, in August 2001 he was slapped with a lawsuit\r\naccusing him of violating federal and state Racketeering\r\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statutes, the\r\nfederal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984, the\r\nfederal Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986\r\nand numerous other state laws. On July 19, 2002 - having\r\nfailed to appear in court - the judge ruled against him. Mr.\r\n\r\nSmith is a spammer.\r\n\r\nBrightmail, a vendor of e-mail filters and anti-spam\r\napplications warned that close to 5 million spam \"attacks\"\r\nor \"bursts\" occurred in June 2002 and that spam has\r\nmushroomed 450 percent since June 2001. This pace\r\ncontinued unabated well into the beginning of 2004 when\r\nthe introduction of spam filters began to take effect. PC\r\nWorld concurs.\r\n\r\nBetween one half and three quarters of all e-mail\r\nmessages are spam or UCE (Unsolicited Commercial\r\nEmail) - unsolicited and intrusive commercial ads, mostly\r\nconcerned with sex, scams, get rich quick schemes,\r\nfinancial services and products, and health articles of\r\ndubious provenance. The messages are sent from spoofed\r\nor fake e-mail addresses. Some spammers hack into\r\nunsecured servers - mainly in China and Korea - to relay\r\ntheir missives anonymously.\r\n\r\nStarting in 2003, malicious hackers began using spam to\r\ninstall malware - such as viruses, adware, spyware, and\r\nTrojans - on the unprotected personal computers of less\r\nsavvy users. They thus transform these computers into\r\n\"zombies\", organize them into spam-spewing \"bots\"\r\n(networks), and sell access to them to criminals on\r\npenumbral boards and forums all over the Net.\r\n\r\nSpam is an industry. Mass e-mailers maintain lists of e-\r\nmail addresses, often \"harvested\" by spamware bots -\r\nspecialized computer applications - from Web sites. These\r\nlists are rented out or sold to marketers who use bulk mail\r\nservices. They come cheap - c. $100 for 10 million\r\naddresses. Bulk mailers provide servers and bandwidth,\r\ncharging c. $300 per million messages sent.\r\n\r\nAs spam recipients become more inured, ISPs less\r\ntolerant, and both more litigious - spammers multiply their\r\nefforts in order to maintain the same response rate. Spam\r\nworks. It is not universally unwanted - which makes it\r\ntricky to outlaw. It elicits between 0.1 and 1 percent in\r\npositive follow ups, depending on the message. Many\r\nmessages now include HTML, JavaScript, and ActiveX\r\ncoding and thus resemble (or actually contain) viruses and\r\nTrojans.\r\n\r\nJupiter Media Matrix predicted in 2001 that the number of\r\nspam messages annually received by a typical Internet\r\nuser will double to 1400 and spending on legitimate e-\r\nmail marketing will reach $9.4 billion by 2006 - compared\r\nto $1 billion in 2001. Forrester Research pegs the number\r\nat $4.8 billion in 2003.\r\n\r\nMore than 2.3-5 billion spam messages are sent daily.\r\neMarketer puts the figures a lot lower at 76 billion\r\nmessages in 2002. By 2006, daily spam output will soar to\r\nc. 15 billion missives, says Radicati Group. Jupiter\r\nprojects a more modest 268 billion annual messages this\r\nyear (2005). An average communication costs the\r\nspammer 0.00032 cents.\r\n\r\nPC World quotes the European Union as pegging the\r\nbandwidth costs of spam worldwide in 2002 at $8-10\r\nbillion annually. Other damages include server crashes,\r\ntime spent purging unwanted messages, lower\r\nproductivity, aggravation, and increased cost of Internet\r\naccess.\r\n\r\nInevitably, the spam industry gave rise to an anti-spam\r\nindustry. According to a Radicati Group report titled\r\n\"Anti-virus, anti-spam, and content filtering market trends\r\n2002-2006\", anti-spam revenues were projected to exceed\r\n$88 million in 2002 - and more than double by 2006. List\r\nblockers, report and complaint generators, advocacy\r\ngroups, registers of known spammers, and spam filters all\r\nproliferate. The Wall Street Journal reported in its June\r\n25, 2002 issue about a resurgence of anti-spam startups\r\nfinanced by eager venture capital.\r\n\r\nISPs are bent on preventing abuse - reported by victims -\r\nby expunging the accounts of spammers. But the latter\r\nsimply switch ISPs or sign on with free services like\r\nHotmail and Yahoo! Barriers to entry are getting lower by\r\nthe day as the costs of hardware, software, and\r\ncommunications plummet.\r\n\r\nThe use of e-mail and broadband connections by the\r\ngeneral population is spreading. Hundreds of thousands of\r\ntechnologically-savvy operators have joined the market in\r\nthe last five years, as the dotcom bubble burst. Still, Steve\r\nLinford of the UK-based Spamhaus.org insists that most\r\nspam emanates from c. 80 large operators.\r\n\r\nNow, according to Jupiter Media, ISPs and portals are\r\npoised to begin to charge advertisers in a tier-based\r\nsystem, replete with premium services. Writing back in\r\n1998, Bill Gates described a solution also espoused by\r\nEsther Dyson, chair of the Electronic Frontier Foundation:\r\n\"As I first described in my book 'The Road Ahead' in\r\n1995, I expect that eventually you'll be paid to read\r\nunsolicited e-mail. You'll tell your e-mail program to\r\ndiscard all unsolicited messages that don't offer an\r\namount of money that you'll choose. If you open a paid\r\nmessage and discover it's from a long-lost friend or\r\nsomebody else who has a legitimate reason to contact\r\nyou, you'll be able to cancel the payment. Otherwise,\r\nyou'll be paid for your time\".\r\n\r\nSubscribers may not be appreciative of the joint ventures\r\nbetween gatekeepers and inbox clutterers. Moreover,\r\ndominant ISPs, such as AT&T and PSINet have\r\nrecurrently been accused of knowingly collaborating with\r\nspammers. ISPs rely on the data traffic that spam\r\ngenerates for their revenues in an ever-harsher business\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nThe Financial Times and others described how WorldCom\r\nrefuses to ban the sale of spamware over its network,\r\nclaiming that it does not regulate content. When \"pink\"\r\n(the color of canned spam) contracts came to light, the\r\nimplicated ISPs blame the whole affair on rogue\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\nPC World begs to differ:\r\n\"Ronnie Scelson, a self-described spammer who signed\r\nsuch a contract with PSInet, (says) that backbone\r\nproviders are more than happy to do business with bulk\r\ne-mailers. 'I've signed up with the biggest 50 carriers\r\ntwo or three times', says Scelson ... The Louisiana-based\r\nspammer claims to send 84 million commercial e-mail\r\nmessages a day over his three 45-megabit-per-second\r\nDS3 circuits. 'If you were getting $40,000 a month for\r\neach circuit', Scelson asks, 'would you want to shut me\r\ndown?'\"\r\nThe line between permission-based or \"opt-in\" e-mail\r\nmarketing and spam is getting thinner by the day. Some\r\nlist resellers guarantee the consensual nature of their\r\nwares. According to the Direct Marketing Association's\r\nguidelines, quoted by PC World, not responding to an\r\nunsolicited e-mail amounts to \"opting-in\" - a marketing\r\nstrategy known as \"opting out\". Most experts, though,\r\nstrongly urge spam victims not to respond to spammers,\r\nlest their e-mail address is confirmed.\r\n\r\nBut spam is crossing technological boundaries. Japan has\r\njust legislated against wireless SMS spam targeted at\r\nhapless mobile phone users. Many states in the USA as\r\nwell as the European parliament have followed suit. Ideas\r\nregarding a \"do not spam\" list akin to the \"do not call\" list\r\nin telemarketing have been floated. Mobile phone users\r\nwill place their phone numbers on the list to avoid\r\nreceiving UCE (spam). Email subscribers enjoy the\r\nbenefits of a similar list under the CAN-Spam Act of\r\n2003.\r\n\r\nExpensive and slow connections make mobile phone\r\nspam and spim (instant messaging spam) particularly\r\nresented. Still, according to Britain's Mobile Channel, a\r\nmobile advertising company quoted by \"The Economist\",\r\nSMS advertising - a novelty - attracts a 10-20 percent\r\nresponse rate - compared to direct mail's 1-3 percent.\r\n\r\nNet identification systems - like Microsoft's Passport and\r\nthe one proposed by Liberty Alliance - will make it even\r\neasier for marketers to target prospects.\r\n\r\nThe reaction to spam can be described only as mass\r\nhysteria. Reporting someone as a spammer - even when\r\nhe is not - has become a favorite pastime of vengeful, self-\r\nappointed, vigilante \"cyber-cops\". Perfectly legitimate,\r\nopt-in, email marketing businesses and discussion forums\r\noften find themselves in one or more black lists - their\r\nreputation and business ruined.\r\n\r\nIn January 2002, CMGI-owned Yesmail was awarded a\r\ntemporary restraining order against MAPS - Mail Abuse\r\nPrevention System - forbidding it to place the reputable e-\r\nmail marketer on its Real-time Blackhole list. The case\r\nwas settled out of court.\r\n\r\nHarris Interactive, a large online opinion polling\r\ncompany, sued not only MAPS, but ISPs who blocked its\r\nemail messages when it found itself included in MAPS'\r\nBlackhole. Their CEO accused one of their competitors\r\nfor the allegations that led to Harris' inclusion in the list.\r\n\r\nCoupled with other pernicious phenomena - such as\r\nviruses, Trojans, and spyware - the very foundation of the\r\nInternet as a fun, relatively safe, mode of communication\r\nand data acquisition is at stake.\r\n\r\nSpammers, it emerges, have their own organizations.\r\n\r\nNOIC - the National Organization of Internet Commerce\r\nthreatened to post to its Web site the e-mail addresses of\r\nmillions of AOL members. AOL has aggressive anti-\r\nspamming policies. \"AOL is blocking bulk email because\r\nit wants the advertising revenues for itself (by selling pop-\r\nup ads)\" the president of NOIC, Damien Melle,\r\ncomplained to CNET.\r\n\r\nSpam is a classic \"free rider\" problem. For any given\r\nindividual, the cost of blocking a spammer far outweighs\r\nthe benefits. It is cheaper and easier to hit the \"delete\"\r\nkey. Individuals, therefore, prefer to let others do the job\r\nand enjoy the outcome - the public good of a spam-free\r\nInternet. They cannot be left out of the benefits of such an\r\naftermath - public goods are, by definition, \"non-\r\nexcludable\". Nor is a public good diminished by a\r\ngrowing number of \"non-rival\" users.\r\n\r\nSuch a situation resembles a market failure and requires\r\ngovernment intervention through legislation and\r\nenforcement. The FTC - the US Federal Trade\r\nCommission - has taken legal action against more than\r\n100 spammers for promoting scams and fraudulent goods\r\nand services.\r\n\"Project Mailbox\" is an anti-spam collaboration between\r\nAmerican law enforcement agencies and the private\r\nsector. Non government organizations have entered the\r\nfray, as have lobbying groups, such as CAUCE - the\r\nCoalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-mail.\r\n\r\nBut, a few recent anti-spam and anti-spyware Acts\r\nnotwithstanding, Congress is curiously reluctant to enact\r\nstringent laws against spam. Reasons cited are free\r\nspeech, limits on state powers to regulate commerce,\r\navoiding unfair restrictions on trade, and the interests of\r\nsmall business. The courts equivocate as well. In some\r\ncases - e.g., Missouri vs. American Blast Fax - US courts\r\nfound \"that the provision prohibiting the sending of\r\nunsolicited advertisements is unconstitutional\".\r\n\r\nAccording to Spamlaws.com,  the 107th Congress, for\r\ninstance, discussed these laws but never enacted them:\r\nUnsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail Act of 2001\r\n(H.R. 95), Wireless Telephone Spam Protection Act (H.R.\r\n113), Anti-Spamming Act of 2001 (H.R. 718), Anti-\r\nSpamming Act of 2001 (H.R. 1017), Who Is E-Mailing\r\nOur Kids Act (H.R. 1846), Protect Children From E-Mail\r\nSmut Act of 2001 (H.R.  2472), Netizens Protection Act\r\nof 2001 (H.R. 3146), \"CAN SPAM\" Act of 2001 (S. 630).\r\n\r\nAnti-spam laws fared no better in the 106th Congress.\r\n\r\nSome of the states have picked up the slack. Arkansas,\r\nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho,\r\nIllinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota,\r\nMissouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma,\r\nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee,\r\nUtah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\nThe situation is no better across the pond. The European\r\nparliament decided in 2001 to allow each member country\r\nto enact its own spam laws, thus avoiding a continent-\r\nwide directive and directly confronting the\r\ncommunications ministers of the union. Paradoxically, it\r\nalso decided, in March 2002, to restrict SMS spam.\r\n\r\nConfusion clearly reigns. Finally, in May 2002, it adopted\r\nstrong anti-spam provisions as part of a Directive on Data\r\nProtection.\r\n\r\nResponding to this unfavorable legal environment, spam\r\nis relocating to developing countries, such as Malaysia,\r\nNepal, and Nigeria. In a May 2005 report, the OECD\r\n(Organization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment) warned that these countries lack the\r\ntechnical know-how and financial resources (let alone the\r\nwill) to combat spam. Their users, anyhow deprived of\r\nbandwidth, endure, as a result, a less reliable service and\r\nan intermittent access to the Internet;\r\n\"Spam is a much more serious issue in developing\r\ncountries...as it is a heavy drain on resources that are\r\nscarcer and costlier in developing countries than\r\nelsewhere\" - writes the report's author, Suresh\r\nRamasubramanian, an OECD advisor and postmaster for\r\nOutblaze.com.\r\n\r\nISPs, spam monitoring services, and governments in the\r\nrich industrialized world react by placing entire countries\r\n- such as Macedonia and Costa Rica - on black lists and,\r\nthus denying access to their users en bloc.\r\n\r\nInternational collaboration against the looming destruction\r\nof the Internet by crime organizations is budding. The\r\nFTC had just announced that it will work with its\r\ncounterparts abroad to cut zombie computers off the\r\nnetwork. A welcome step - but about three years late.\r\n\r\nSpammers the world over are still six steps ahead and are\r\nhaving the upper hand.\r\n\r\nThe Content Downloader's Profile\r\nInterview granted to Tim Emmerling, a student at Eastern\r\nIllinois University.\r\n\r\nQ. What do you know about people illegally\r\ndownloading files over the internet?\r\nA. I know what everyone knows from being exposed to\r\nthe news media and to lawsuits filed by publishers: the\r\nphenomenon is widespread and most of the millions of\r\nexchanged files are music tracks and films (though book\r\nrip-offs are not unknown as well).\r\n\r\nQ. Why do you think people are taking part in these\r\nelectronic transactions? Does the cost of purchasing the\r\nmedia come into play?\r\nA. It's a complex canvass of motivations, I guess. Many\r\nmedia products (especially in developing and poor\r\ncountries) are overpriced in terms of the local purchasing\r\npower. Illegally downloading them is often an act of\r\nprotest or defiance against what disgruntled consumers\r\nperceive as excessive profiteering. It may also be the only\r\nrealistic way to gain ownership of coveted content.\r\n\r\nThe fact that everything - from text to images - is digital\r\nmakes replication facile and enticing. Illegal downloading\r\nalso probably confers an aura of daring and mystique on\r\nthe \"pirates\" involved (whose life may otherwise be a lot\r\ndrearier and mundane).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, these products resemble public goods in that\r\nthey are nonrivalrous (the cost of extending the service or\r\nproviding the good to another person is (close to) zero)\r\nand largely nonexcludable.\r\n\r\nMost products are rivalrous (scarce) - zero sum games.\r\n\r\nHaving been consumed, they are gone and are not\r\navailable to others. Public goods, in contrast, are\r\naccessible to growing numbers of people without any\r\nadditional marginal cost. This wide dispersion of benefits\r\nrenders them unsuitable for private entrepreneurship. It is\r\nimpossible to recapture the full returns they engender. As\r\nSamuelson observed, they are extreme forms of positive\r\nexternalities (spillover effects).\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is impossible to exclude anyone from\r\nenjoying the benefits of a public good, or from defraying\r\nits costs (positive and negative externalities). Neither can\r\nanyone willingly exclude himself from their remit.\r\n\r\nNeedless to emphasize that media products are not public\r\ngoods at all! They only superficially resemble public\r\ngoods. Still, the fact that many books, music, and some\r\nfilms are, indeed, in the public domain further exacerbates\r\nthe consumer's confusion. \"Why can I (legally) download\r\ncertain books and music tracks free of charge - but not\r\nothers?\" - wonders the baffled surfer, who is rarely versed\r\nin the intricacies of copyright laws.\r\n\r\nQ. Do you think this leads to a feeling of disrespect\r\ntoward the various pieces of media by the person that\r\nsteals it so frequently? (If I download music all the time,\r\nwill I lose interest in it?)\r\n\r\nA. I am not sure that the word \"respect\" is relevant here.\r\n\r\nPeople don't respect or disrespect music - they enjoy it,\r\nlike it, or dislike it. But frequent illegal downloading of\r\nmedia products is, probably, the outcome of disrespect\r\ntowards content intermediaries such as publishers,\r\nproducers, and retail outlets. I don't know for sure because\r\nthere is no research to guide us in this matter, but I would\r\nimagine that these people (wrongly) perceive content\r\nintermediaries as parasitic and avaricious.\r\n\r\nQ. Downloading is still a widespread act today. The\r\nthreats of lawsuits and legal action against downloaders\r\nhasn't stopped the problem. What, in your opinion,\r\nneeds to be done to stop this behavior?\r\n\r\nA. Law enforcement activities and lawsuits are already\r\nhaving an effect. But you cannot prosecute thousands of\r\npeople on a regular basis without suffering a\r\ncommensurate drop in popularity and a tarnished image.\r\n\r\nPeople do not perceive these acts as self-defense but as\r\nDavid vs. Goliath bullying. Sooner or later, the efficacy of\r\nsuch measures is bound to decline.\r\n\r\nMedia companies would do better to adopt new\r\ntechnologies rather than fight them. They must come forth\r\nwith new business models and new venues of\r\ndissemination of content. They have to show more\r\ngenerosity in the management of digital rights. They have\r\nto adopt differential pricing of their products across the\r\nboard, to reflect disparities in earnings and purchasing\r\npower in the global marketplace. They have to transform\r\nthemselves rather than try to coerce the world into their\r\nantiquated and Procrustean ways of doing things.\r\n\r\nQ. Psychologically speaking, is there a certain kind of\r\nperson who is more likely to take part in this behavior?\r\nDo you feel that this is a generational issue?\r\n\r\nA. I cannot but speculate. There is a dearth of data at this\r\nearly stage. I would imagine that illegal downloaders are\r\nhoarders. They are into owning things rather than into\r\nusing or consuming them. They are into building libraries\r\nand collections. They are young and intelligent, but not\r\naffluent. They are irreverent, rebellious, and non-\r\nconformist. They may be loners who network socially\r\nonly online. Some of them love culture and its artifacts\r\nbut they need not be particularly computer-savvy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII. The Fabric of Economic Trust\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomics acquired its dismal reputation by pretending to\r\nbe an exact science rather than a branch of mass\r\npsychology. In truth it is a narrative struggling to describe\r\nthe aggregate behavior of humans. It seeks to cloak its\r\nuncertainties and shifting fashions with mathematical\r\nformulae and elaborate econometric computerized\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\nSo much is certain, though - that people operate within\r\nmarkets, free or regulated, patchy or organized. They\r\nattach numerical (and emotional) values to their inputs\r\n(work, capital) and to their possessions (assets, natural\r\nendowments). They communicate these values to each\r\nother by sending out signals known as prices.\r\n\r\nYet, this entire edifice - the market and its price\r\nmechanism - critically depends on trust. If people do not\r\ntrust each other, or the economic \"envelope\" within which\r\nthey interact - economic activity gradually grinds to a halt.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong correlation between the general level of\r\ntrust and the extent and intensity of economic activity.\r\n\r\nFrancis Fukuyama, the political scientist, distinguishes\r\nbetween high-trust and prosperous societies and low-trust\r\nand, therefore, impoverished collectives. Trust underlies\r\neconomic success, he argued in a 1995 tome.\r\n\r\nTrust is not a monolithic quantity. There are a few\r\ncategories of economic trust. Some forms of trust are akin\r\nto a public good and are closely related to governmental\r\naction or inaction, the reputation of the state and its\r\ninstitutions, and its pronounced agenda. Other types of\r\ntrust are the outcomes of kinship, ethnic origin, personal\r\nstanding and goodwill, corporate brands and other data\r\ngenerated by individuals, households, and firms.\r\n\r\nI. Trust in the playing field\r\nTo transact, people have to maintain faith in a relevant\r\neconomic horizon and in the immutability of the\r\neconomic playing field or \"envelope\". Put less obscurely,\r\na few hidden assumptions underlie the continued\r\neconomic activity of market players.\r\n\r\nThey assume, for instance, that the market will continue to\r\nexist for the foreseeable future in its current form. That it\r\nwill remain inert - unhindered by externalities like\r\ngovernment intervention, geopolitical upheavals, crises,\r\nabrupt changes in accounting policies and tax laws,\r\nhyperinflation, institutional and structural reform and\r\nother market-deflecting events and processes.\r\n\r\nThey further assume that their price signals will not be\r\ndistorted or thwarted on a consistent basis thus skewing\r\nthe efficient and rational allocation of risks and rewards.\r\n\r\nInsider trading, stock manipulation, monopolies, hoarding\r\n- all tend to consistently but unpredictably distort price\r\nsignals and, thus, deter market participation.\r\n\r\nMarket players take for granted the existence and\r\ncontinuous operation of institutions - financial\r\nintermediaries, law enforcement agencies, courts. It is\r\nimportant to note that market players prefer continuity and\r\ncertainty to evolution, however gradual and ultimately\r\nbeneficial. A venal bureaucrat is a known quantity and\r\ncan be tackled effectively. A period of transition to good\r\nand equitable governance can be more stifling than any\r\nlevel of corruption and malfeasance. This is why\r\neconomic activity drops sharply whenever institutions are\r\nreformed.\r\n\r\nII. Trust in other players\r\nMarket players assume that other players are (generally)\r\nrational, that they have intentions, that they intend to\r\nmaximize their benefits and that they are likely to act on\r\ntheir intentions in a legal (or rule-based), rational manner.\r\n\r\nIII. Trust in market liquidity\r\nMarket players assume that other players possess or have\r\naccess to the liquid means they need in order to act on\r\ntheir intentions and obligations. They know, from\r\npersonal experience, that idle capital tends to dwindle and\r\nthat the only way to, perhaps, maintain or increase it is to\r\ntransact with others, directly or through intermediaries,\r\nsuch as banks.\r\n\r\nIV. Trust in others' knowledge and ability\r\nMarket players assume that other players possess or have\r\naccess to the intellectual property, technology, and\r\nknowledge they need in order to realize their intentions\r\nand obligations. This implicitly presupposes that all other\r\nmarket players are physically, mentally, legally and\r\nfinancially able and willing to act their parts as stipulated,\r\nfor instance, in contracts they sign.\r\n\r\nThe emotional dimensions of contracting are often\r\nneglected in economics. Players assume that their\r\ncounterparts maintain a realistic and stable sense of self-\r\nworth based on intimate knowledge of their own strengths\r\nand weaknesses. Market participants are presumed to\r\nharbor realistic expectations, commensurate with their\r\nskills and accomplishments. Allowance is made for\r\nexaggeration, disinformation, even outright deception -\r\nbut these are supposed to be marginal phenomena.\r\n\r\nWhen trust breaks down - often the result of an external or\r\ninternal systemic shock - people react expectedly. The\r\nnumber of voluntary interactions and transactions\r\ndecreases sharply. With a collapsed investment horizon,\r\nindividuals and firms become corrupt in an effort to\r\nshortcut their way into economic benefits, not knowing\r\nhow long will the system survive. Criminal activity\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\nPeople compensate with fantasies and grandiose delusions\r\nfor their growing sense of uncertainty, helplessness, and\r\nfears.  This is a self-reinforcing mechanism, a vicious\r\ncycle which results in under-confidence and a fluctuating\r\nself esteem. They develop psychological defence\r\nmechanisms.\r\n\r\nCognitive dissonance (\"I really choose to be poor rather\r\nthan heartless\"), pathological envy (seeks to deprive\r\nothers and thus gain emotional reward), rigidity (\"I am\r\nlike that, my family or ethnic group has been like that for\r\ngenerations, there is nothing I can do\"), passive-\r\naggressive behavior (obstructing the work flow,\r\nabsenteeism, stealing from the employer, adhering strictly\r\nto arcane regulations) - are all reactions to a breakdown in\r\none or more of the four aforementioned types of trust.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, people in a trust crisis are unable to\r\npostpone gratification. They often become frustrated,\r\naggressive, and deceitful if denied. They resort to reckless\r\nbehavior and stopgap economic activities.\r\n\r\nIn economic environments with compromised and\r\nimpaired trust, loyalty decreases and mobility increases.\r\n\r\nPeople switch jobs, renege on obligations, fail to repay\r\ndebts, relocate often. Concepts like exclusivity, the\r\nsanctity of contracts, workplace loyalty, or a career path -\r\nall get eroded. As a result, little is invested in the future, in\r\nthe acquisition of skills, in long term savings. Short-\r\ntermism and bottom line mentality rule.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes of a crisis of trust are, usually, catastrophic:\r\nEconomic activity is much reduced, human capital is\r\ncorroded and wasted, brain drain increases, illegal and\r\nextra-legal activities rise, society is polarized between\r\nhaves and haves-not, interethnic and inter-racial tensions\r\nincrease. To rebuild trust in such circumstances is a\r\ndaunting task. The loss of trust is contagious and, finally,\r\nit infects every institution and profession in the land. It is\r\nthe stuff revolutions are made of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. The Distributive Justice of the Market\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public outcry against executive pay and compensation\r\nfollowed disclosures of insider trading, double dealing,\r\nand outright fraud. But even honest and productive\r\nentrepreneurs often earn more money in one year than\r\nAlbert Einstein did in his entire life. This strikes many -\r\nespecially academics - as unfair. Surely Einstein's\r\ncontributions to human knowledge and welfare far exceed\r\nanything ever accomplished by sundry businessmen?\r\nFortunately, this discrepancy is cause for constructive\r\njealousy, emulation, and imitation. It can, however, lead\r\nto an orgy of destructive and self-ruinous envy.\r\n\r\nSuch envy is reinforced by declining social mobility in the\r\nUnited States. Recent (2006-7) studies by the OECD\r\n(Organization for Economic Cooperation and\r\nDevelopment) clearly demonstrate that the American\r\nDream is a myth. In an editorial dated July 13, 2007, the\r\nNew-York Times described the rapidly deteriorating\r\nsituation thus:\r\n\"... (M)obility between generations - people doing\r\nbetter or worse than their parents - is weaker in\r\nAmerica than in Denmark, Austria, Norway, Finland,\r\nCanada, Sweden, Germany, Spain and France. In\r\nAmerica, there is more than a 40 percent chance that if\r\na father is in the bottom fifth of the earnings'\r\ndistribution, his son will end up there, too. In Denmark,\r\nthe equivalent odds are under 25 percent, and they are\r\nless than 30 percent in Britain.\r\n\r\nAmerica's sluggish mobility is ultimately unsurprising.\r\n\r\nWealthy parents not only pass on that wealth in\r\ninheritances, they can pay for better education, nutrition\r\nand health care for their children. The poor cannot\r\nafford this investment in their children's development -\r\nand the government doesn't provide nearly enough help.\r\n\r\nIn a speech earlier this year, the Federal Reserve\r\nchairman, Ben Bernanke, argued that while the\r\ninequality of rewards fuels the economy by making\r\npeople exert themselves, opportunity should be \"as\r\nwidely distributed and as equal as possible.\" The\r\nproblem is that the have-nots don't have many\r\nopportunities either\".\r\n\r\nStill, entrepreneurs recombine natural and human\r\nresources in novel ways. They do so to respond to\r\nforecasts of future needs, or to observations of failures\r\nand shortcomings of current products or services.\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurs are professional - though usually intuitive -\r\nfuturologists. This is a valuable service and it is financed\r\nby systematic risk takers, such as venture capitalists.\r\n\r\nSurely they all deserve compensation for their efforts and\r\nthe hazards they assume?\r\nExclusive ownership is the most ancient type of such\r\nremuneration. First movers, entrepreneurs, risk takers,\r\nowners of the wealth they generated, exploiters of\r\nresources - are allowed to exclude others from owning or\r\nexploiting the same things. Mineral concessions, patents,\r\ncopyright, trademarks - are all forms of monopoly\r\nownership. What moral right to exclude others is gained\r\nfrom being the first?\r\nNozick advanced Locke's Proviso. An exclusive\r\nownership of property is just only if \"enough and as good\r\nis left in common for others\". If it does not worsen other\r\npeople's lot, exclusivity is morally permissible. It can be\r\nargued, though, that all modes of exclusive ownership\r\naggravate other people's situation. As far as everyone, bar\r\nthe entrepreneur, are concerned, exclusivity also prevents\r\na more advantageous distribution of income and wealth.\r\n\r\nExclusive ownership reflects real-life irreversibility. A\r\nfirst mover has the advantage of excess information and of\r\nirreversibly invested work, time, and effort. Economic\r\nenterprise is subject to information asymmetry: we know\r\nnothing about the future and everything about the past.\r\n\r\nThis asymmetry is known as \"investment risk\". Society\r\ncompensates the entrepreneur with one type of asymmetry\r\n- exclusive ownership - for assuming another, the\r\ninvestment risk.\r\n\r\nOne way of looking at it is that all others are worse off by\r\nthe amount of profits and rents accruing to owner-\r\nentrepreneurs. Profits and rents reflect an intrinsic\r\ninefficiency. Another is to recall that ownership is the\r\nresult of adding value to the world. It is only reasonable to\r\nexpect it to yield to the entrepreneur at least this value\r\nadded now and in the future.\r\n\r\nIn a \"Theory of Justice\" (published 1971, p. 302), John\r\nRawls described an ideal society thus:\r\n\"(1) Each person is to have an equal right to the most\r\nextensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible\r\nwith a similar system of liberty for all. (2) Social and\r\neconomic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are\r\nboth: (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged,\r\nconsistent with the just savings principle, and (b) attached\r\nto offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair\r\nequality of opportunity\".\r\n\r\nIt all harks back to scarcity of resources - land, money,\r\nraw materials, manpower, creative brains. Those who can\r\nafford to do so, hoard resources to offset anxiety\r\nregarding future uncertainty. Others wallow in paucity.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of means is thus skewed. \"Distributive\r\njustice\" deals with the just allocation of scarce resources.\r\n\r\nYet, even the basic terminology is somewhat fuzzy. What\r\nconstitutes a resource? what is meant by allocation? Who\r\nshould allocate resources - Adam Smith's \"invisible\r\nhand\", the government, the consumer, or business? Should\r\nit reflect differences in power, in intelligence, in\r\nknowledge, or in heredity? Should resource allocation be\r\nsubject to a principle of entitlement? Is it reasonable to\r\ndemand that it be just - or merely efficient? Are justice\r\nand efficiency antonyms?\r\nJustice is concerned with equal access to opportunities.\r\n\r\nEqual access does not guarantee equal outcomes,\r\ninvariably determined by idiosyncrasies and differences\r\nbetween people. Access leveraged by the application of\r\nnatural or acquired capacities - translates into accrued\r\nwealth. Disparities in these capacities lead to\r\ndiscrepancies in accrued wealth.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of equal access is founded on the\r\nequivalence of Men. That all men are created equal and\r\ndeserve the same respect and, therefore, equal treatment is\r\nnot self evident. European aristocracy well into this\r\ncentury would have probably found this notion abhorrent.\r\n\r\nJose Ortega Y Gasset, writing in the 1930's, preached that\r\naccess to educational and economic opportunities should\r\nbe premised on one's lineage, up bringing, wealth, and\r\nsocial responsibilities.\r\n\r\nA succession of societies and cultures discriminated\r\nagainst the ignorant, criminals, atheists, females,\r\nhomosexuals, members of ethnic, religious, or racial\r\ngroups, the old, the immigrant, and the poor. Communism\r\n- ostensibly a strict egalitarian idea - foundered because it\r\nfailed to reconcile strict equality with economic and\r\npsychological realities within an impatient timetable.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers tried to specify a \"bundle\" or \"package\" of\r\ngoods, services, and intangibles (like information, or\r\nskills, or knowledge). Justice - though not necessarily\r\nhappiness - is when everyone possesses an identical\r\nbundle. Happiness - though not necessarily justice - is\r\nwhen each one of us possesses a \"bundle\" which reflects\r\nhis or her preferences, priorities, and predilections. None\r\nof us will be too happy with a standardized bundle,\r\nselected by a committee of philosophers - or bureaucrats,\r\nas was the case under communism.\r\n\r\nThe market allows for the exchange of goods and services\r\nbetween holders of identical bundles. If I seek books, but\r\ndetest oranges - I can swap them with someone in return\r\nfor his books. That way both of us are rendered better off\r\nthan under the strict egalitarian version.\r\n\r\nStill, there is no guarantee that I will find my exact match\r\n- a person who is interested in swapping his books for my\r\noranges. Illiquid, small, or imperfect markets thus inhibit\r\nthe scope of these exchanges. Additionally, exchange\r\nparticipants have to agree on an index: how many books\r\nfor how many oranges? This is the price of oranges in\r\nterms of books.\r\n\r\nMoney - the obvious \"index\" - does not solve this\r\nproblem, merely simplifies it and facilitates exchanges. It\r\ndoes not eliminate the necessity to negotiate an \"exchange\r\nrate\". It does not prevent market failures. In other words:\r\nmoney is not an index. It is merely a medium of exchange\r\nand a store of value. The index - as expressed in terms of\r\nmoney - is the underlying agreement regarding the values\r\nof resources in terms of other resources (i.e., their relative\r\nvalues).\r\n\r\nThe market - and the price mechanism - increase\r\nhappiness and welfare by allowing people to alter the\r\ncomposition of their bundles. The invisible hand is just\r\nand benevolent. But money is imperfect. The\r\naforementioned Rawles demonstrated (1971), that we\r\nneed to combine money with other measures in order to\r\nplace a value on intangibles.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing market theories postulate that everyone has\r\nthe same resources at some initial point (the \"starting\r\ngate\"). It is up to them to deploy these endowments and,\r\nthus, to ravage or increase their wealth. While the initial\r\ndistribution is equal - the end distribution depends on how\r\nwisely - or imprudently - the initial distribution was used.\r\n\r\nEgalitarian thinkers proposed to equate everyone's income\r\nin each time frame (e.g., annually). But identical incomes\r\ndo not automatically yield the same accrued wealth. The\r\nlatter depends on how the income is used - saved,\r\ninvested, or squandered. Relative disparities of wealth are\r\nbound to emerge, regardless of the nature of income\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nSome say that excess wealth should be confiscated and\r\nredistributed. Progressive taxation and the welfare state\r\naim to secure this outcome. Redistributive mechanisms\r\nreset the \"wealth clock\" periodically (at the end of every\r\nmonth, or fiscal year). In many countries, the law dictates\r\nwhich portion of one's income must be saved and, by\r\nimplication, how much can be consumed. This conflicts\r\nwith basic rights like the freedom to make economic\r\nchoices.\r\n\r\nThe legalized expropriation of income (i.e., taxes) is\r\nmorally dubious. Anti-tax movements have sprung all\r\nover the world and their philosophy permeates the\r\nideology of political parties in many countries, not least\r\nthe USA. Taxes are punitive: they penalize enterprise,\r\nsuccess, entrepreneurship, foresight, and risk assumption.\r\n\r\nWelfare, on the other hand, rewards dependence and\r\nparasitism.\r\n\r\nAccording to Rawles' Difference Principle, all tenets of\r\njustice are either redistributive or retributive. This ignores\r\nnon-economic activities and human inherent variance.\r\n\r\nMoreover, conflict and inequality are the engines of\r\ngrowth and innovation - which mostly benefit the least\r\nadvantaged in the long run. Experience shows that\r\nunmitigated equality results in atrophy, corruption and\r\nstagnation. Thermodynamics teaches us that life and\r\nmotion are engendered by an irregular distribution of\r\nenergy. Entropy - an even distribution of energy - equals\r\ndeath and stasis.\r\n\r\nWhat about the disadvantaged and challenged - the\r\nmentally retarded, the mentally insane, the paralyzed, the\r\nchronically ill? For that matter, what about the less\r\ntalented, less skilled, less daring? Dworkin (1981)\r\nproposed a compensation scheme. He suggested a model\r\nof fair distribution in which every person is given the\r\nsame purchasing power and uses it to bid, in a fair\r\nauction, for resources that best fit that person's life plan,\r\ngoals and preferences.\r\n\r\nHaving thus acquired these resources, we are then\r\npermitted to use them as we see fit. Obviously, we end up\r\nwith disparate economic results. But we cannot complain -\r\nwe were given the same purchasing power and the\r\nfreedom to bid for a bundle of our choice.\r\n\r\nDworkin assumes that prior to the hypothetical auction,\r\npeople are unaware of their own natural endowments but\r\nare willing and able to insure against being naturally\r\ndisadvantaged. Their payments create an insurance pool to\r\ncompensate the less fortunate for their misfortune.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is highly unrealistic. We are usually very\r\nmuch aware of natural endowments and liabilities - both\r\nours and others'. Therefore, the demand for such insurance\r\nis not universal, nor uniform. Some of us badly need and\r\nwant it - others not at all. It is morally acceptable to let\r\nwilling buyers and sellers to trade in such coverage (e.g.,\r\nby offering charity or alms) - but may be immoral to make\r\nit compulsory.\r\n\r\nMost of the modern welfare programs are involuntary\r\nDworkin schemes. Worse yet, they often measure\r\ndifferences in natural endowments arbitrarily, compensate\r\nfor lack of acquired skills, and discriminate between types\r\nof endowments in accordance with cultural biases and\r\nfads.\r\n\r\nLibertarians limit themselves to ensuring a level playing\r\nfield of just exchanges, where just actions always result in\r\njust outcomes. Justice is not dependent on a particular\r\ndistribution pattern, whether as a starting point, or as an\r\noutcome. Robert Nozick \"Entitlement Theory\" proposed\r\nin 1974 is based on this approach.\r\n\r\nThat the market is wiser than any of its participants is a\r\npillar of the philosophy of capitalism. In its pure form, the\r\ntheory claims that markets yield patterns of merited\r\ndistribution - i.e., reward and punish justly. Capitalism\r\ngenerate just deserts. Market failures - for instance, in the\r\nprovision of public goods - should be tackled by\r\ngovernments. But a just distribution of income and wealth\r\ndoes not constitute a market failure and, therefore, should\r\nnot be tampered with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX.  The Agent-Principal Conundrum\r\n\r\nIn the catechism of capitalism, shares represent the part-\r\nownership of an economic enterprise, usually a firm. The\r\nvalue of shares is determined by the replacement value of\r\nthe assets of the firm, including intangibles such as\r\ngoodwill. The price of the share is determined by\r\ntransactions among arm's length buyers and sellers in an\r\nefficient and liquid market. The price reflects expectations\r\nregarding the future value of the firm and the stock's\r\nfuture stream of income - i.e., dividends.\r\n\r\nAlas, none of these oft-recited dogmas bears any\r\nresemblance to reality. Shares rarely represent ownership.\r\n\r\nThe float - the number of shares available to the public - is\r\nfrequently marginal. Shareholders meet once a year to\r\nvent and disperse. Boards of directors are appointed by\r\nmanagement - as are auditors. Shareholders are not\r\nrepresented in any decision making process - small or big.\r\n\r\nThe dismal truth is that shares reify the expectation to find\r\nfuture buyers at a higher price and thus incur capital gains.\r\n\r\nIn the Ponzi scheme known as the stock exchange, this\r\nexpectation is proportional to liquidity - new suckers - and\r\nvolatility. Thus, the price of any given stock reflects\r\nmerely the consensus as to how easy it would be to\r\noffload one's holdings and at what price.\r\n\r\nAnother myth has to do with the role of managers. They\r\nare supposed to generate higher returns to shareholders by\r\nincreasing the value of the firm's assets and, therefore, of\r\nthe firm. If they fail to do so, goes the moral tale, they are\r\nbooted out mercilessly. This is one manifestation of the\r\n\"Principal-Agent Problem\". It is defined thus by the\r\nOxford Dictionary of Economics:\r\n\"The problem of how a person A can motivate person B to\r\nact for A's benefit rather than following (his) self-\r\ninterest\".\r\n\r\nThe obvious answer is that A can never motivate B not to\r\nfollow B's self-interest - never mind what the incentives\r\nare. That economists pretend otherwise - in \"optimal\r\ncontracting theory\" - just serves to demonstrate how\r\ndivorced economics is from human psychology and, thus,\r\nfrom reality.\r\n\r\nManagers will always rob blind the companies they run.\r\n\r\nThey will always manipulate boards to collude in their\r\nshenanigans. They will always bribe auditors to bend the\r\nrules. In other words, they will always act in their self-\r\ninterest. In their defense, they can say that the damage\r\nfrom such actions to each shareholder is minuscule while\r\nthe benefits to the manager are enormous. In other words,\r\nthis is the rational, self-interested, thing to do.\r\n\r\nBut why do shareholders cooperate with such corporate\r\nbrigandage? In an important Chicago Law Review article\r\nwhose preprint was posted to the Web a few weeks ago -\r\ntitled \"Managerial Power and Rent Extraction in the\r\nDesign of Executive Compensation\" - the authors\r\ndemonstrate how the typical stock option granted to\r\nmanagers as part of their remuneration rewards mediocrity\r\nrather than encourages excellence.\r\n\r\nBut everything falls into place if we realize that\r\nshareholders and managers are allied against the firm - not\r\npitted against each other. The paramount interest of both\r\nshareholders and managers is to increase the value of the\r\nstock - regardless of the true value of the firm. Both are\r\nconcerned with the performance of the share - rather than\r\nthe performance of the firm. Both are preoccupied with\r\nboosting the share's price - rather than the company's\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nHence the inflationary executive pay packets.\r\n\r\nShareholders hire stock manipulators - euphemistically\r\nknown as \"managers\" - to generate expectations regarding\r\nthe future prices of their shares. These snake oil salesmen\r\nand snake charmers - the corporate executives - are\r\nallowed by shareholders to loot the company providing\r\nthey generate consistent capital gains to their masters by\r\nprovoking persistent interest and excitement around the\r\nbusiness. Shareholders, in other words, do not behave as\r\nowners of the firm - they behave as free-riders.\r\n\r\nThe Principal-Agent Problem arises in other social\r\ninteractions and is equally misunderstood there. Consider\r\ntaxpayers and their government. Contrary to conservative\r\nlore, the former want the government to tax them\r\nproviding they share in the spoils. They tolerate\r\ncorruption in high places, cronyism, nepotism, inaptitude\r\nand worse - on condition that the government and the\r\nlegislature redistribute the wealth they confiscate. Such\r\nredistribution often comes in the form of pork barrel\r\nprojects and benefits to the middle-class.\r\n\r\nThis is why the tax burden and the government's share of\r\nGDP have been soaring inexorably with the consent of the\r\ncitizenry. People adore government spending precisely\r\nbecause it is inefficient and distorts the proper allocation\r\nof economic resources. The vast majority of people are\r\nrent-seekers. Witness the mass demonstrations that erupt\r\nwhenever governments try to slash expenditures,\r\nprivatize, and eliminate their gaping deficits. This is one\r\nreason the IMF with its austerity measures is universally\r\nunpopular.\r\n\r\nEmployers and employees, producers and consumers -\r\nthese are all instances of the Principal-Agent Problem.\r\n\r\nEconomists would do well to discard their models and go\r\nback to basics. They could start by asking:\r\nWhy do shareholders acquiesce with executive\r\nmalfeasance as long as share prices are rising?\r\nWhy do citizens protest against a smaller government -\r\neven though it means lower taxes?\r\nCould it mean that the interests of shareholders and\r\nmanagers are identical? Does it imply that people prefer\r\ntax-and-spend governments and pork barrel politics to the\r\nThatcherite alternative?\r\nNothing happens by accident or by coercion. Shareholders\r\naided and abetted the current crop of corporate executives\r\nenthusiastically. They knew well what was happening.\r\n\r\nThey may not have been aware of the exact nature and\r\nextent of the rot - but they witnessed approvingly the\r\npublic relations antics, insider trading, stock option\r\nresetting , unwinding, and unloading, share price\r\nmanipulation, opaque transactions, and outlandish pay\r\npackages. Investors remained mum throughout the\r\ncorruption of corporate America. It is time for the\r\nhangover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL.  The Green-Eyed Capitalist\r\n\r\nConservative sociologists self-servingly marvel at the\r\npeaceful proximity of abject poverty and ostentatious\r\naffluence in American - or, for that matter, Western -\r\ncities. Devastating riots do erupt, but these are reactions\r\neither to perceived social injustice (Los Angeles 1965) or\r\nto political oppression (Paris 1968). The French\r\nRevolution may have been the last time the urban sans-\r\nculotte raised a fuss against the economically\r\nenfranchised.\r\n\r\nThis pacific co-existence conceals a maelstrom of envy.\r\n\r\nBehold the rampant Schadenfreude which accompanied\r\nthe antitrust case against the predatory but loaded\r\nMicrosoft. Observe the glee which engulfed many\r\ndestitute countries in the wake of the September 11\r\natrocities against America, the epitome of triumphant\r\nprosperity. Witness the post-World.com orgiastic\r\ncastigation of avaricious CEO's.\r\n\r\nEnvy - a pathological manifestation of destructive\r\naggressiveness - is distinct from jealousy.\r\n\r\nThe New Oxford Dictionary of English defines envy as:\r\n\"A feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by\r\nsomeone else's possessions, qualities, or luck ...\r\n\r\nMortification and ill-will occasioned by the contemplation\r\nof another's superior advantages\".\r\n\r\nPathological envy - the fourth deadly sin - is engendered\r\nby the realization of some lack, deficiency, or inadequacy\r\nin oneself. The envious begrudge others their success,\r\nbrilliance, happiness, beauty, good fortune, or wealth.\r\n\r\nEnvy provokes misery, humiliation, and impotent rage.\r\n\r\nThe envious copes with his pernicious emotions in five\r\nways:\r\n1. They attack the perceived source of frustration in\r\nan attempt to destroy it, or \"reduce it\" to their\r\n\"size\". Such destructive impulses often assume the\r\ndisguise of championing social causes, fighting\r\ninjustice, touting reform, or promoting an\r\nideology.\r\n2. They seek to subsume the object of envy by\r\nimitating it. In extreme cases, they strive to get\r\nrich quick through criminal scams, or corruption.\r\n\r\nThey endeavor to out-smart the system and\r\nshortcut their way to fortune and celebrity.\r\n3. They resort to self-deprecation. They idealize the\r\nsuccessful, the rich, the mighty, and the lucky and\r\nattribute to them super-human, almost divine,\r\nqualities. At the same time, they humble\r\nthemselves. Indeed, most of this strain of the\r\nenvious end up disenchanted and bitter, driving the\r\nobjects of their own erstwhile devotion and\r\nadulation to destruction and decrepitude.\r\n4. They experience cognitive dissonance. These\r\npeople devalue the source of their frustration and\r\nenvy by finding faults in everything they most\r\ndesire and in everyone they envy.\r\n5. They avoid the envied person and thus the\r\nagonizing pangs of envy.\r\n\r\nEnvy is not a new phenomenon. Belisarius, the general\r\nwho conquered the world for Emperor Justinian, was\r\nblinded and stripped of his assets by his envious peers. I -\r\nand many others - have written extensively about envy in\r\ncommand economies. Nor is envy likely to diminish.\r\n\r\nIn his book, \"Facial Justice\", Hartley describes a post-\r\napocalyptic dystopia, New State, in which envy is\r\nforbidden and equality extolled and everything enviable is\r\nobliterated. Women are modified to look like men and\r\ngiven identical \"beta faces\". Tall buildings are razed.\r\n\r\nJoseph Schumpeter, the prophetic Austrian-American\r\neconomist, believed that socialism will disinherit\r\ncapitalism. In \"Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy\" he\r\nforesaw a conflict between a class of refined but dirt-poor\r\nintellectuals and the vulgar but filthy rich businessmen\r\nand managers they virulently envy and resent. Samuel\r\nJohnson wrote: \"He was dull in a new way, and that made\r\nmany people think him great.\" The literati seek to tear\r\ndown the market economy which they feel has so\r\ndisenfranchised and undervalued them.\r\n\r\nHitler, who fancied himself an artist, labeled the British a\r\n\"nation of shopkeepers\" in one of his bouts of raging\r\nenvy. Ralph Reiland, the Kenneth Simon professor of free\r\nenterprise at Robert Morris University, quotes David\r\nBrooks of the \"weekly Standard\", who christened this\r\nphenomenon \"bourgeoisophobia\":\r\n\"The hatred of the bourgeoisie is the beginning of all\r\nvirtue' - wrote Gustav Flaubert. He signed his letters\r\n'Bourgeoisophobus' to show how much he despised 'stupid\r\ngrocers and their ilk ... Through some screw-up in the\r\ngreat scheme of the universe, their narrow-minded greed\r\nhad brought them vast wealth, unstoppable power and\r\ngrowing social prestige\".\r\n\r\nReiland also quotes from Ludwig van Mises's \"The Anti-\r\nCapitalist Mentality\":\r\n\"Many people, and especially intellectuals, passionately\r\nloathe capitalism. In a society based on caste and status,\r\nthe individual can ascribe adverse fate to conditions\r\nbeyond his control. In ... capitalism ... everybody's station\r\nin life depends on his doing ... (what makes a man rich is)\r\nnot the evaluation of his contribution from any 'absolute'\r\nprinciple of justice but the evaluation on the part of his\r\nfellow men who exclusively apply the yardstick of their\r\npersonal wants, desires and ends ... Everybody knows\r\nvery well that there are people like himself who succeeded\r\nwhere he himself failed. Everybody knows that many of\r\nthose he envies are self-made men who started from the\r\nsame point from which he himself started. Everybody is\r\naware of his own defeat. In order to console himself and\r\nto restore his self- assertion, such a man is in search of a\r\nscapegoat. He tries to persuade himself that he failed\r\nthrough no fault of his own. He was too decent to resort to\r\nthe base tricks to which his successful rivals owe their\r\nascendancy. The nefarious social order does not accord\r\nthe prizes to the most meritorious men; it crowns the\r\ndishonest, unscrupulous scoundrel, the swindler, the\r\nexploiter, the 'rugged individualist'\".\r\n\r\nIn \"The Virtue of Prosperity\", Dinesh D'Souza accuses\r\nprosperity and capitalism of inspiring vice and temptation.\r\n\r\nInevitably, it provokes envy in the poor and depravity in\r\nthe rich.\r\n\r\nWith only a modicum of overstatement, capitalism can be\r\ndepicted as the sublimation of jealousy. As opposed to\r\ndestructive envy - jealousy induces emulation. Consumers\r\n- responsible for two thirds of America's GDP - ape role\r\nmodels and vie with neighbors, colleagues, and family\r\nmembers for possessions and the social status they endow.\r\n\r\nProductive and constructive competition - among\r\nscientists, innovators, managers, actors, lawyers,\r\npoliticians, and the members of just about every other\r\nprofession - is driven by jealousy.\r\n\r\nThe eminent Nobel prize winning British economist and\r\nphilosopher of Austrian descent, Friedrich Hayek,\r\nsuggested in \"The Constitution of Liberty\" that innovation\r\nand progress in living standards are the outcomes of class\r\nenvy. The wealthy are early adopters of expensive and\r\nunproven technologies. The rich finance with their\r\nconspicuous consumption the research and development\r\nphase of new products. The poor, driven by jealousy,\r\nimitate them and thus create a mass market which allows\r\nmanufacturers to lower prices.\r\n\r\nBut jealousy is premised on the twin beliefs of equality\r\nand a level playing field. \"I am as good, as skilled, and as\r\ntalented as the object of my jealousy.\" - goes the subtext -\r\n\"Given equal opportunities, equitable treatment, and a bit\r\nof luck, I can accomplish the same or more\".\r\n\r\nJealousy is easily transformed to outrage when its\r\npresumptions - equality, honesty, and fairness - prove\r\nwrong. In a paper recently published by Harvard\r\nUniversity's John M. Olin Center for Law and titled\r\n\"Executive Compensation in America: Optimal\r\nContracting or Extraction of Rents?\", the authors argue\r\nthat executive malfeasance is most effectively regulated\r\nby this \"outrage constraint\":\r\n\"Directors (and non-executive directors) would be\r\nreluctant to approve, and executives would be hesitant to\r\nseek, compensation arrangements that might be viewed by\r\nobservers as outrageous\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes on the Economics of\r\nGame Theory\r\n\r\nConsider this:\r\nCould Western management techniques be successfully\r\nimplemented in the countries of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope (CEE)? Granted, they have to be adapted,\r\nmodified and cannot be imported in their entirety. But\r\ntheir crux, their inalienable nucleus - can this be\r\ntransported and transplanted in CEE? Theory provides us\r\nwith a positive answer. Human agents are the same\r\neverywhere and are mostly rational. Practice begs to\r\ndiffer. Basic concepts such as the money value of time or\r\nthe moral and legal meaning of property are non existent.\r\n\r\nThe legal, political and economic environments are all\r\nunpredictable. As a result, economic players will prefer to\r\nmaximize their utility immediately (steal from the\r\nworkplace, for instance) - than to wait for longer term\r\n(potentially, larger) benefits. Warrants (stock options)\r\nconvertible to the company's shares constitute a strong\r\nworkplace incentive in the West (because there is an\r\nhorizon and they increase the employee's welfare in the\r\nlong term). Where the future is speculation - speculation\r\nwithers. Stock options or a small stake in his firm, will\r\nonly encourage the employee to blackmail the other\r\nshareholders by paralysing the firm, to abuse his new\r\nposition and will be interpreted as immunity, conferred\r\nfrom above, from the consequences of illegal activities.\r\n\r\nThe very allocation of options or shares will be interpreted\r\nas a sign of weakness, dependence and need, to be\r\nexploited. Hierarchy is equated with slavery and\r\nemployees will rather harm their long term interests than\r\nfollow instructions or be subjected to criticism - never\r\nmind how constructive. The employees in CEE regard the\r\ncorporate environment as a conflict zone, a zero sum\r\ngame (in which the gains by some equal the losses to\r\nothers). In the West, the employees participate in the\r\nincrease in the firm's value. The difference between these\r\nattitudes is irreconcilable.\r\n\r\nNow, let us consider this:\r\nAn entrepreneur is a person who is gifted at identifying\r\nthe unsatisfied needs of a market, at mobilizing and\r\norganizing the resources required to satisfy those needs\r\nand at defining a long-term strategy of development and\r\nmarketing. As the enterprise grows, two processes\r\ncombine to denude the entrepreneur of some of his initial\r\nfunctions. The firm has ever growing needs for capital:\r\nfinancial, human, assets and so on. Additionally, the\r\ncompany begins (or should begin) to interface and interact\r\nwith older, better established firms. Thus, the company is\r\nforced to create its first management team: a general\r\nmanager with the right doses of respectability,\r\nconnections and skills, a chief financial officer, a host of\r\nconsultants and so on. In theory - if all our properly\r\nmotivated financially - all these players (entrepreneurs\r\nand managers) will seek to maximize the value of the\r\nfirm. What happens, in reality, is that both work to\r\nminimize it, each for its own reasons. The managers seek\r\nto maximize their short-term utility by securing enormous\r\npay packages and other forms of company-dilapidating\r\ncompensation. The entrepreneurs feel that they are\r\n\"strangled\", \"shackled\", \"held back\" by bureaucracy and\r\nthey \"rebel\". They oust the management, or undermine it,\r\nturning it into an ineffective representative relic. They\r\nassume real, though informal, control of the firm. They do\r\nso by defining a new set of strategic goals for the firm,\r\nwhich call for the institution of an entrepreneurial rather\r\nthan a bureaucratic type of management. These cycles of\r\ninitiative-consolidation-new initiative-revolution-\r\nconsolidation are the dynamos of company growth.\r\n\r\nGrowth leads to maximization of value. However, the\r\nplayers don't know or do not fully believe that they are in\r\nthe process of maximizing the company's worth. On the\r\ncontrary, consciously, the managers say: \"Let's maximize\r\nthe benefits that we derive from this company, as long as\r\nwe are still here.\" The entrepreneurs-owners say: \"We\r\ncannot tolerate this stifling bureaucracy any longer. We\r\nprefer to have a smaller company - but all ours.\" The\r\ngrowth cycles forces the entrepreneurs to dilute their\r\nholdings (in order to raise the capital necessary to finance\r\ntheir initiatives). This dilution (the fracturing of the\r\nownership structure) is what brings the last cycle to its\r\nend. The holdings of the entrepreneurs are too small to\r\nmaterialize a coup against the management. The\r\nmanagement then prevails and the entrepreneurs are\r\nneutralized and move on to establish another start-up. The\r\nonly thing that they leave behind them is their names and\r\ntheir heirs.\r\n\r\nWe can use Game Theory methods to analyse both these\r\nsituations. Wherever we have economic players\r\nbargaining for the allocation of scarce resources in order\r\nto attain their utility functions, to secure the outcomes and\r\nconsequences (the value, the preference, that the player\r\nattaches to his outcomes) which are right for them - we\r\ncan use Game Theory (GT).\r\n\r\nA short recap of the basic tenets of the theory might be in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nGT deals with interactions between agents, whether\r\nconscious and intelligent - or Dennettic. A Dennettic\r\nAgent (DA) is an agent that acts so as to influence the\r\nfuture allocation of resources, but does not need to be\r\neither conscious or deliberative to do so. A Game is the\r\nset of acts committed by 1 to n rational DA and one a-\r\nrational (not irrational but devoid of rationality) DA\r\n(nature, a random mechanism). At least 1 DA in a Game\r\nmust control the result of the set of acts and the DAs must\r\nbe (at least potentially) at conflict, whole or partial. This\r\nis not to say that all the DAs aspire to the same things.\r\n\r\nThey have different priorities and preferences. They rank\r\nthe likely outcomes of their acts differently. They engage\r\nStrategies to obtain their highest ranked outcome. A\r\nStrategy is a vector, which details the acts, with which the\r\nDA will react in response to all the (possible) acts by the\r\nother DAs. An agent is said to be rational if his Strategy\r\ndoes guarantee the attainment of his most preferred goal.\r\n\r\nNature is involved by assigning probabilities to the\r\noutcomes. An outcome, therefore, is an allocation of\r\nresources resulting from the acts of the agents. An agent is\r\nsaid to control the situation if its acts matter to others to\r\nthe extent that at least one of them is forced to alter at\r\nleast one vector (Strategy). The Consequence to the agent\r\nis the value of a function that assigns real numbers to each\r\nof the outcomes. The consequence represents a list of\r\noutcomes, prioritized, ranked. It is also known as an\r\nordinal utility function. If the function includes relative\r\nnumerical importance measures (not only real numbers) -\r\nwe call it a Cardinal Utility Function.\r\n\r\nGames, naturally, can consist of one player, two players\r\nand more than two players (n-players). They can be zero\r\n(or fixed) - sum (the sum of benefits is fixed and whatever\r\ngains made by one of the players are lost by the others).\r\n\r\nThey can be nonzero-sum (the amount of benefits to all\r\nplayers can increase or decrease). Games can be\r\ncooperative (where some of the players or all of them\r\nform coalitions) - or non-cooperative (competitive). For\r\nsome of the games, the solutions are called Nash\r\nequilibria. They are sets of strategies constructed so that\r\nan agent which adopts them (and, as a result, secures a\r\ncertain outcome) will have no incentive to switch over to\r\nother strategies (given the strategies of all other players).\r\n\r\nNash equilibria (solutions) are the most stable (it is where\r\nthe system \"settles down\", to borrow from Chaos Theory)\r\n- but they are not guaranteed to be the most desirable.\r\n\r\nConsider the famous \"Prisoners' Dilemma\" in which both\r\nplayers play rationally and reach the Nash equilibrium\r\nonly to discover that they could have done much better by\r\ncollaborating (that is, by playing irrationally). Instead,\r\nthey adopt the \"Paretto-dominated\", or the \"Paretto-\r\noptimal\", sub-optimal solution. Any outside interference\r\nwith the game (for instance, legislation) will be construed\r\nas creating a NEW game, not as pushing the players to\r\nadopt a \"Paretto-superior\" solution.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the players reveals to us their order of\r\npreferences. This is called \"Preference Ordering\" or\r\n\"Revealed Preference Theory\". Agents are faced with sets\r\nof possible states of the world (=allocations of resources,\r\nto be more economically inclined). These are called\r\n\"Bundles\". In certain cases they can trade their bundles,\r\nswap them with others. The evidence of these swaps will\r\ninevitably reveal to us the order of priorities of the agent.\r\n\r\nAll the bundles that enjoy the same ranking by a given\r\nagent - are this agent's \"Indifference Sets\". The\r\nconstruction of an Ordinal Utility Function is, thus, made\r\nsimple. The indifference sets are numbered from 1 to n.\r\n\r\nThese ordinals do not reveal the INTENSITY or the\r\nRELATIVE INTENSITY of a preference - merely its\r\nlocation in a list. However, techniques are available to\r\ntransform the ordinal utility function - into a cardinal one.\r\n\r\nA Stable Strategy is similar to a Nash solution - though\r\nnot identical mathematically. There is currently no\r\ncomprehensive theory of Information Dynamics. Game\r\nTheory is limited to the aspects of competition and\r\nexchange of information (cooperation). Strategies that\r\nlead to better results (independently of other agents) are\r\ndominant and where all the agents have dominant\r\nstrategies - a solution is established. Thus, the Nash\r\nequilibrium is applicable to games that are repeated and\r\nwherein each agent reacts to the acts of other agents. The\r\nagent is influenced by others - but does not influence\r\nthem (he is negligible). The agent continues to adapt in\r\nthis way - until no longer able to improve his position.\r\n\r\nThe Nash solution is less available in cases of cooperation\r\nand is not unique as a solution. In most cases, the players\r\nwill adopt a minimax strategy (in zero-sum games) or\r\nmaximin strategies (in nonzero-sum games). These\r\nstrategies guarantee that the loser will not lose more than\r\nthe value of the game and that the winner will gain at least\r\nthis value. The solution is the \"Saddle Point\".\r\n\r\nThe distinction between zero-sum games (ZSG) and\r\nnonzero-sum games (NZSG) is not trivial. A player\r\nplaying a ZSG cannot gain if prohibited to use certain\r\nstrategies. This is not the case in NZSGs. In ZSG, the\r\nplayer does not benefit from exposing his strategy to his\r\nrival and is never harmed by having foreknowledge of his\r\nrival's strategy. Not so in NZSGs: at times, a player stands\r\nto gain by revealing his plans to the \"enemy\". A player\r\ncan actually be harmed by NOT declaring his strategy or\r\nby gaining acquaintance with the enemy's stratagems. The\r\nvery ability to communicate, the level of communication\r\nand the order of communication - are important in\r\ncooperative cases. A Nash solution:\r\n1. Is not dependent upon any utility function;\r\n2. It is impossible for two players to improve the\r\nNash solution (=their position) simultaneously\r\n(=the Paretto optimality);\r\n3. Is not influenced by the introduction of irrelevant\r\n(not very gainful) alternatives; and\r\n4. Is symmetric (reversing the roles of the players\r\ndoes not affect the solution).\r\n\r\nThe limitations of this approach are immediately evident.\r\n\r\nIt is definitely not geared to cope well with more complex,\r\nmulti-player, semi-cooperative (semi-competitive),\r\nimperfect information situations.\r\n\r\nVon Neumann proved that there is a solution for every\r\nZSG with 2 players, though it might require the\r\nimplementation of mixed strategies (strategies with\r\nprobabilities attached to every move and outcome).\r\n\r\nTogether with the economist Morgenstern, he developed\r\nan approach to coalitions (cooperative efforts of one or\r\nmore players - a coalition of one player is possible).\r\n\r\nEvery coalition has a value - a minimal amount that the\r\ncoalition can secure using solely its own efforts and\r\nresources. The function describing this value is super-\r\nadditive (the value of a coalition which is comprised of\r\ntwo sub-coalitions equals, at least, the sum of the values\r\nof the two sub-coalitions). Coalitions can be\r\nepiphenomenal: their value can be higher than the\r\ncombined values of their constituents. The amounts paid\r\nto the players equal the value of the coalition and each\r\nplayer stands to get an amount no smaller than any\r\namount that he would have made on his own. A set of\r\npayments to the players, describing the division of the\r\ncoalition's value amongst them, is the \"imputation\", a\r\nsingle outcome of a strategy. A strategy is, therefore,\r\ndominant, if: (1) each player is getting more under the\r\nstrategy than under any other strategy and (2) the players\r\nin the coalition receive a total payment that does not\r\nexceed the value of the coalition. Rational players are\r\nlikely to prefer the dominant strategy and to enforce it.\r\n\r\nThus, the solution to an n-players game is a set of\r\nimputations. No single imputation in the solution must be\r\ndominant (=better). They should all lead to equally\r\ndesirable results. On the other hand, all the imputations\r\noutside the solution should be dominated. Some games are\r\nwithout solution (Lucas, 1967).\r\n\r\nAuman and Maschler tried to establish what is the right\r\npayoff to the members of a coalition. They went about it\r\nby enlarging upon the concept of bargaining (threats,\r\nbluffs, offers and counter-offers). Every imputation was\r\nexamined, separately, whether it belongs in the solution\r\n(=yields the highest ranked outcome) or not, regardless of\r\nthe other imputations in the solution. But in their theory,\r\nevery member had the right to \"object\" to the inclusion of\r\nother members in the coalition by suggesting a different,\r\nexclusionary, coalition in which the members stand to\r\ngain a larger payoff. The player about to be excluded can\r\n\"counter-argue\" by demonstrating the existence of yet\r\nanother coalition in which the members will get at least as\r\nmuch as in the first coalition and in the coalition proposed\r\nby his adversary, the \"objector\". Each coalition has, at\r\nleast, one solution.\r\n\r\nThe Game in GT is an idealized concept. Some of the\r\nassumptions can - and should be argued against. The\r\nnumber of agents in any game is assumed to be finite and\r\na finite number of steps is mostly incorporated into the\r\nassumptions. Omissions are not treated as acts (though\r\nnegative ones). All agents are negligible in their\r\nrelationship to others (have no discernible influence on\r\nthem) - yet are influenced by them (their strategies are not\r\n- but the specific moves that they select - are). The\r\ncomparison of utilities is not the result of any ranking -\r\nbecause no universal ranking is possible. Actually, no\r\nranking common to two or n players is possible (rankings\r\nare bound to differ among players). Many of the problems\r\nare linked to the variant of rationality used in GT. It is\r\ncomprised of a clarity of preferences on behalf of the\r\nrational agent and relies on the people's tendency to\r\nconverge and cluster around the right answer / move.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is only a tendency. Some of the time,\r\nplayers select the wrong moves. It would have been much\r\nwiser to assume that there are no pure strategies, that all\r\nof them are mixed. Game Theory would have done well to\r\nborrow mathematical techniques from quantum\r\nmechanics. For instance: strategies could have been\r\ndescribed as wave functions with probability distributions.\r\n\r\nThe same treatment could be accorded to the cardinal\r\nutility function. Obviously, the highest ranking (smallest\r\nordinal) preference should have had the biggest\r\nprobability attached to it - or could be treated as the\r\ncollapse event. But these are more or less known, even\r\ntrivial, objections. Some of them cannot be overcome. We\r\nmust idealize the world in order to be able to relate to it\r\nscientifically at all. The idealization process entails the\r\nincorporation of gross inaccuracies into the model and the\r\nignorance of other elements. The surprise is that the\r\napproximation yields results, which tally closely with\r\nreality - in view of its mutilation, affected by the model.\r\n\r\nThere are more serious problems, philosophical in nature.\r\n\r\nIt is generally agreed that \"changing\" the game can - and\r\nvery often does - move the players from a non-\r\ncooperative mode (leading to Paretto-dominated results,\r\nwhich are never desirable) - to a cooperative one. A\r\ngovernment can force its citizens to cooperate and to obey\r\nthe law. It can enforce this cooperation. This is often\r\ncalled a Hobbesian dilemma. It arises even in a population\r\nmade up entirely of altruists. Different utility functions\r\nand the process of bargaining are likely to drive these\r\ngood souls to threaten to become egoists unless other\r\naltruists adopt their utility function (their preferences,\r\ntheir bundles). Nash proved that there is an allocation of\r\npossible utility functions to these agents so that the\r\nequilibrium strategy for each one of them will be this kind\r\nof threat. This is a clear social Hobbesian dilemma: the\r\nequilibrium is absolute egoism despite the fact that all the\r\nplayers are altruists. This implies that we can learn very\r\nlittle about the outcomes of competitive situations from\r\nacquainting ourselves with the psychological facts\r\npertaining to the players. The agents, in this example, are\r\nnot selfish or irrational - and, still, they deteriorate in their\r\nbehaviour, to utter egotism. A complete set of utility\r\nfunctions - including details regarding how much they\r\nknow about one another's utility functions - defines the\r\navailable equilibrium strategies. The altruists in our\r\nexample are prisoners of the logic of the game. Only an\r\n\"outside\" power can release them from their predicament\r\nand permit them to materialize their true nature. Gauthier\r\nsaid that morally-constrained agents are more likely to\r\nevade Paretto-dominated outcomes in competitive games\r\n- than agents who are constrained only rationally. But this\r\nis unconvincing without the existence of an Hobesian\r\nenforcement mechanism (a state is the most common\r\none). Players would do better to avoid Paretto dominated\r\noutcomes by imposing the constraints of such a\r\nmechanism upon their available strategies. Paretto\r\noptimality is defined as efficiency, when there is no state\r\nof things (a different distribution of resources) in which at\r\nleast one player is better off - with all the other no worse\r\noff. \"Better off\" read: \"with his preference satisfied\". This\r\ndefinitely could lead to cooperation (to avoid a bad\r\noutcome) - but it cannot be shown to lead to the formation\r\nof morality, however basic. Criminals can achieve their\r\ngoals in splendid cooperation and be content, but that does\r\nnot make it more moral. Game theory is agent neutral, it is\r\nutilitarianism at its apex. It does not prescribe to the agent\r\nwhat is \"good\" - only what is \"right\". It is the ultimate\r\nproof that effort at reconciling utilitarianism with more\r\ndeontological, agent relative, approaches are dubious, in\r\nthe best of cases. Teleology, in other words, in no\r\nguarantee of morality.\r\n\r\nActs are either means to an end or ends in themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is no infinite regression. There is bound to be an holy\r\ngrail (happiness?) in the role of the ultimate end. A more\r\ncommonsense view would be to regard acts as means and\r\nstates of affairs as ends. This, in turn, leads to a\r\nteleological outlook: acts are right or wrong in accordance\r\nwith their effectiveness at securing the achievement of the\r\nright goals. Deontology (and its stronger version,\r\nabsolutism) constrain the means. It states that there is a\r\npermitted subset of means, all the other being immoral\r\nand, in effect, forbidden. Game Theory is out to shatter\r\nboth the notion of a finite chain of means and ends\r\nculminating in an ultimate end - and of the deontological\r\nview. It is consequentialist but devoid of any value\r\njudgement.\r\n\r\nGame Theory pretends that human actions are breakable\r\ninto much smaller \"molecules\" called games. Human acts\r\nwithin these games are means to achieving ends but the\r\nends are improbable in their finality. The means are\r\nsegments of \"strategies\": prescient and omniscient\r\nrenditions of the possible moves of all the players. Aside\r\nfrom the fact that it involves mnemic causation (direct and\r\ndeterministic influence by past events) and a similar\r\ninfluence by the utility function (which really pertains to\r\nthe future) - it is highly implausible. Additionally, Game\r\nTheory is mired in an internal contradiction: on the one\r\nhand it solemnly teaches us that the psychology of the\r\nplayers is absolutely of no consequence. On the other, it\r\nhastens to explicitly and axiomatically postulate their\r\nrationality and implicitly (and no less axiomatically) their\r\nbenefit-seeking behaviour (though this aspect is much\r\nmore muted). This leads to absolutely outlandish results:\r\nirrational behaviour leads to total cooperation, bounded\r\nrationality leads to more realistic patterns of cooperation\r\nand competition (coopetition) and an unmitigated rational\r\nbehaviour leads to disaster (also known as Paretto\r\ndominated outcomes).\r\n\r\nMoreover, Game Theory refuses to acknowledge that real\r\ngames are dynamic, not static. The very concepts of\r\nstrategy, utility function and extensive (tree like)\r\nrepresentation are static. The dynamic is retrospective, not\r\nprospective. To be dynamic, the game must include all the\r\ninformation about all the actors, all their strategies, all\r\ntheir utility functions. Each game is a subset of a higher\r\nlevel game, a private case of an implicit game which is\r\nconstantly played in the background, so to say. This is a\r\nhyper-game of which all games are but derivatives. It\r\nincorporates all the physically possible moves of all the\r\nplayers. An outside agency with enforcement powers (the\r\nstate, the police, the courts, the law) are introduced by the\r\nplayers. In this sense, they are not really an outside event\r\nwhich has the effect of altering the game fundamentally.\r\n\r\nThey are part and parcel of the strategies available to the\r\nplayers and cannot be arbitrarily ruled out. On the\r\ncontrary, their introduction as part of a dominant strategy\r\nwill simplify Game theory and make it much more\r\napplicable. In other words: players can choose to compete,\r\nto cooperate and to cooperate in the formation of an\r\noutside agency. There is no logical or mathematical\r\nreason to exclude the latter possibility. The ability to thus\r\ninfluence the game is a legitimate part of any real life\r\nstrategy. Game Theory assumes that the game is a given -\r\nand the players have to optimize their results within it. It\r\nshould open itself to the inclusion of game altering or\r\nredefining moves by the players as an integral part of their\r\nstrategies. After all, games entail the existence of some\r\nagreement to play and this means that the players accept\r\nsome rules (this is the role of the prosecutor in the\r\nPrisoners' Dilemma). If some outside rules (of the game)\r\nare permissible - why not allow the \"risk\" that all the\r\nplayers will agree to form an outside, lawfully binding,\r\narbitration and enforcement agency - as part of the game?\r\nSuch an agency will be nothing if not the embodiment, the\r\nmaterialization of one of the rules, a move in the players'\r\nstrategies, leading them to more optimal or superior\r\noutcomes as far as their utility functions are concerned.\r\n\r\nBargaining inevitably leads to an agreement regarding a\r\ndecision making procedure. An outside agency, which\r\nenforces cooperation and some moral code, is such a\r\ndecision making procedure. It is not an \"outside\" agency\r\nin the true, physical, sense. It does not \"alter\" the game\r\n(not to mention its rules). It IS the game, it is a procedure,\r\na way to resolve conflicts, an integral part of any solution\r\nand imputation, the herald of cooperation, a representative\r\nof some of the will of all the players and, therefore, a part\r\nboth of their utility functions and of their strategies to\r\nobtain their preferred outcomes. Really, these outside\r\nagencies ARE the desired outcomes. Once Game Theory\r\ndigests this observation, it could tackle reality rather than\r\nits own idealized contraptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII.  Market Impeders and Market Inefficiencies\r\n\r\nEven the most devout proponents of free marketry and\r\nhidden hand theories acknowledge the existence of market\r\nfailures, market imperfections and inefficiencies in the\r\nallocation of economic resources. Some of these are the\r\nresults of structural problems, others of an accumulation\r\nof historical liabilities. But, strikingly, some of the\r\ninefficiencies are the direct outcomes of the activities of\r\n\"non bona fide\" market participants. These \"players\"\r\n(individuals, corporations, even larger economic bodies,\r\nsuch as states) act either irrationally or egotistically (too\r\nrationally).\r\n\r\nWhat characterizes all those \"market impeders\" is that\r\nthey are value subtractors rather than value adders. Their\r\nactivities generate a reduction, rather than an increase, in\r\nthe total benefits (utilities) of all the other market players\r\n(themselves included). Some of them do it because they\r\nare after a self interest which is not economic (or, more\r\nstrictly, financial). They sacrifice some economic benefits\r\nin order to satisfy that self interest (or, else, they could\r\nnever have attained these benefits, in the first place).\r\n\r\nOthers refuse to accept the self interest of other players as\r\ntheir limit. They try to maximize their benefits at any cost,\r\nas long as it is a cost to others. Some do so legally and\r\nsome adopt shadier varieties of behaviour. And there is a\r\ngroup of parasites - participants in the market who feed\r\noff its very inefficiencies and imperfections and, by their\r\nvery actions, enhance them. A vicious cycle ensues: the\r\nbody economic gives rise to parasitic agents who thrive on\r\nits imperfections and lead to the amplification of the very\r\nimpurities that they prosper on.\r\n\r\nWe can distinguish six classes of market impeders:\r\n1. Crooks and other illegal operators. These take\r\nadvantage of ignorance, superstition, greed, avarice,\r\nemotional states of mind of their victims - to strike. They\r\nre-allocate resources from (potentially or actually)\r\nproductive agents to themselves. Because they reduce the\r\nlevel of trust in the marketplace - they create negative\r\nadded value. (See: \"The Shadowy World of International\r\nFinance\" and \"The Fabric of Economic Trust\")\r\n2. Illegitimate operators include those treading the\r\nthin line between legally permissible and ethically\r\ninadmissible. They engage in petty cheating\r\nthrough misrepresentations, half-truths, semi-\r\nrumours and the like. They are full of pretensions\r\nto the point of becoming impostors. They are\r\nwheeler-dealers, sharp-cookies, Daymon Ranyon\r\ncharacters, lurking in the shadows cast by the sun\r\nof the market. Their impact is to slow down the\r\neconomic process through disinformation and the\r\nresulting misallocation of resources. They are the\r\nsand in the wheels of the economic machine.\r\n3. The \"not serious\" operators. These are people too\r\nhesitant, or phobic to commit themselves to the\r\nassumption of any kind of risk. Risk is the coal in\r\nthe various locomotives of the economy, whether\r\nlocal, national, or global. Risk is being assumed,\r\ntraded, diversified out of, avoided, insured against.\r\n\r\nIt gives rise to visions and hopes and it is the most\r\nefficient \"economic natural selection\" mechanism.\r\n\r\nTo be a market participant one must assume risk, it\r\nin an inseparable part of economic activity.\r\n\r\nWithout it the wheels of commerce and finance,\r\ninvestments and technological innovation will\r\nimmediately grind to a halt. But many operators\r\nare so risk averse that, in effect, they increase the\r\ninefficiency of the market in order to avoid it.\r\n\r\nThey act as though they are resolute, risk assuming\r\noperators. They make all the right moves, utter all\r\nthe right sentences and emit the perfect noises. But\r\nwhen push comes to shove - they recoil, retreat,\r\ndefeated before staging a fight. Thus, they waste\r\nthe collective resources of all that the operators\r\nthat they get involved with. They are known to\r\nendlessly review projects, often change their\r\nminds, act in fits and starts, have the wrong\r\npriorities (for an efficient economic functioning,\r\nthat is), behave in a self defeating manner, be\r\nhorrified by any hint of risk, saddled and\r\nsurrounded by every conceivable consultant,\r\nglutted by information. They are the stick in the\r\nspinning wheel of the modern marketplace.\r\n4. The former kind of operators obviously has a\r\ncharacter problem. Yet, there is a more\r\nproblematic species: those suffering from serious\r\npsychological problems, personality disorders,\r\nclinical phobias, psychoneuroses and the like. This\r\nhuman aspect of the economic realm has, to the\r\nbest of my knowledge, been neglected before.\r\n\r\nEnormous amounts of time, efforts, money and\r\nenergy are expended by the more \"normal\" -\r\nbecause of the \"less normal\" and the \"eccentric\".\r\n\r\nThese operators are likely to regard the\r\nmaintaining of their internal emotional balance as\r\nparamount, far over-riding economic\r\nconsiderations. They will sacrifice economic\r\nadvantages and benefits and adversely affect their\r\nutility outcome in the name of principles, to quell\r\npsychological tensions and pressures, as part of\r\nobsessive-compulsive rituals, to maintain a false\r\ngrandiose image, to go on living in a land of\r\nfantasy, to resolve a psychodynamic conflict and,\r\ngenerally, to cope with personal problems which\r\nhave nothing to do with the idealized rational\r\neconomic player of the theories. If quantified, the\r\namounts of resources wasted in these coping\r\nmanoeuvres is, probably, mind numbing. Many\r\ndeals clinched are revoked, many businesses\r\nstarted end, many detrimental policy decisions\r\nadopted and many potentially beneficial situations\r\navoided because of these personal upheavals.\r\n5. Speculators and middlemen are yet another\r\nspecies of parasites. In a theoretically totally\r\nefficient marketplace - there would have been no\r\nniche for them. They both thrive on information\r\nfailures. The first kind engages in arbitrage\r\n(differences in pricing in two markets of an\r\nidentical good - the result of inefficient\r\ndissemination of information) and in gambling.\r\n\r\nThese are important and blessed functions in an\r\nimperfect world because they make it more\r\nperfect. The speculative activity equates prices\r\nand, therefore, sends the right signals to market\r\noperators as to how and where to most efficiently\r\nallocate their resources. But this is the passive\r\nspeculator. The \"active\" speculator is really a\r\nmarket rigger. He corners the market by the\r\ndubious virtue of his reputation and size. He\r\ninfluences the market (even creates it) rather than\r\nmerely exploit its imperfections. Soros and Buffet\r\nhave such an influence though their effect is likely\r\nto be considered beneficial by unbiased observers.\r\n\r\nMiddlemen are a different story because most of\r\nthem belong to the active subcategory. This means\r\nthat they, on purpose, generate market\r\ninconsistencies, inefficiencies and problems - only\r\nto solve them later at a cost extracted and paid to\r\nthem, the perpetrators of the problem. Leaving\r\nethical questions aside, this is a highly wasteful\r\nprocess. Middlemen use privileged information\r\nand access - whereas speculators use information\r\nof a more public nature. Speculators normally\r\nwork within closely monitored, full disclosure,\r\ntransparent markets. Middlemen thrive of\r\ndisinformation, misinformation and lack of\r\ninformation. Middlemen monopolize their\r\ninformation - speculators share it, willingly or not.\r\n\r\nThe more information becomes available to more\r\nusers - the greater the deterioration in the\r\nresources consumed by brokers of information.\r\n\r\nThe same process will likely apply to middlemen\r\nof goods and services. We are likely to witness the\r\ndeath of the car dealer, the classical retail outlet,\r\nthe music records shop. For that matter, inventions\r\nlike the internet is likely to short-circuit the whole\r\ndistribution process in a matter of a few years.\r\n6. The last type of market impeders is well known\r\nand is the only one to have been tackled - with\r\nvarying degrees of success by governments and by\r\nlegislators worldwide. These are the trade\r\nrestricting arrangements: monopolies, cartels,\r\ntrusts and other illegal organizations. Rivers of\r\ninks were spilled over forests of paper to explain\r\nthe pernicious effects of these anti-competitive\r\npractices (see: \"Competition Laws\"). The short\r\nand the long of it is that competition enhances and\r\nincreases efficiency and that, therefore, anything\r\nthat restricts competition, weakens and lessens\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nWhat could anyone do about these inefficiencies? The\r\nworld goes in circles of increasing and decreasing free\r\nmarketry. The globe was a more open, competitive and, in\r\ncertain respects, efficient place at the beginning of the 20th\r\ncentury than it is now. Capital flowed more freely and so\r\ndid labour. Foreign Direct Investment was bigger. The\r\nmore efficient, \"friction free\" the dissemination of\r\ninformation (the ultimate resource) - the less waste and\r\nthe smaller the lebensraum for parasites. The more\r\nadherence to market, price driven, open auction based,\r\nmeritocratic mechanisms - the less middlemen,\r\nspeculators, bribers, monopolies, cartels and trusts. The\r\nless political involvement in the workings of the market\r\nand, in general, in what consenting adults conspire to do\r\nthat is not harmful to others - the more efficient and\r\nflowing the economic ambience is likely to become.\r\n\r\nThis picture of \"laissez faire, laissez aller\" should be\r\ncomplimented by even stricter legislation coupled with\r\neffective and draconian law enforcement agents and\r\nmeasures. The illegal and the illegitimate should be\r\nstamped out, cruelly. Freedom to all - is also freedom\r\nfrom being conned or hassled. Only when the righteous\r\nfreely prosper and the less righteous excessively suffer -\r\nonly then will we have entered the efficient kingdom of\r\nthe free market.\r\n\r\nThis still does not deal with the \"not serious\" and the\r\n\"personality disordered\". What about the inefficient havoc\r\nthat they wreak? This, after all, is part of what is known,\r\nin legal parlance as: \"force majeure\".\r\n\r\nNote\r\nThere is a raging debate between the \"rational\r\nexpectations\" theory and the \"prospect theory\". The\r\nformer - the cornerstone of rational economics - assumes\r\nthat economic (human) players are rational and out to\r\nmaximize their utility (see: \"The Happiness of Others\",\r\n\"The Egotistic Friend\" and \"The Distributive Justice of\r\nthe Market\"). Even ignoring the fuzzy logic behind the ill-\r\ndefined philosophical term \"utility\" - rational economics\r\nhas very little to do with real human being and a lot to do\r\nwith sterile (though mildly useful) abstractions. Prospect\r\ntheory builds on behavioural research in modern\r\npsychology which demonstrates that people are more loss\r\naverse than gain seekers (utility maximizers). Other\r\neconomists have succeeded to demonstrate irrational\r\nbehaviours of economic actors (heuristics, dissonances,\r\nbiases, magical thinking and so on).\r\n\r\nThe apparent chasm between the rational theories\r\n(efficient markets, hidden hands and so on) and\r\nbehavioural economics is the result of two philosophical\r\nfallacies which, in turn, are based on the misapplication\r\nand misinterpretation of philosophical terms.\r\n\r\nThe first fallacy is to assume that all forms of utility are\r\nreducible to one another or to money terms. Thus, the\r\nvalues attached to all utilities are expressed in monetary\r\nterms. This is wrong. Some people prefer leisure, or\r\nfreedom, or predictability to expected money. This is the\r\nvery essence of risk aversion: a trade off between the\r\nutility of predictability (absence or minimization of risk)\r\nand the expected utility of money. In other words, people\r\nhave many utility functions running simultaneously - or,\r\nat best, one utility function with many variables and\r\ncoefficients. This is why taxi drivers in New York cease\r\nworking in a busy day, having reached a pre-determined\r\nincome target: the utility function of their money equals\r\nthe utility function of their leisure.\r\n\r\nHow can these coefficients (and the values of these\r\nvariables) be determined? Only by engaging in extensive\r\nempirical research. There is no way for any theory or\r\n\"explanation\" to predict these values. We have yet to\r\nreach the stage of being able to quantify, measure and\r\nnumerically predict human behaviour and personality\r\n(=the set of adaptive traits and their interactions with\r\nchanging circumstances). That economics is a branch of\r\npsychology is becoming more evident by the day. It\r\nwould do well to lose its mathematical pretensions and\r\nadopt the statistical methods of its humbler relative.\r\n\r\nThe second fallacy is the assumption underlying both\r\nrational and behavioural economics that human nature is\r\nan \"object\" to be analysed and \"studied\", that it is static\r\nand unchanged. But, of course, humans change\r\ninexorably. This is the only fixed feature of being human:\r\nchange. Some changes are unpredictable, even in\r\ndeterministic principle. Other changes are well\r\ndocumented. An example of the latter class of changes in\r\nthe learning curve. Humans learn and the more they learn\r\nthe more they alter their behaviour. So, to obtain any\r\nmeaningful data, one has to observe behaviour in time, to\r\nobtain a sequence of reactions and actions. To isolate,\r\nobserve and manipulate environmental variables and\r\nstudy human interactions. No snapshot can approximate a\r\nvideo sequence where humans are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII. The Pettifogger Procurators\r\n\r\nDiplomats in Post-Communist Countries\r\n\r\nIn 2001, the most unusual event has gone unnoticed in the\r\ninternational press. A former minister of finance has\r\naccused the more prominent members of the diplomatic\r\ncorps in his country of corruption. He insisted that these\r\nparagons of indignant righteousness and hectoring\r\nmorality have tried to blackmail him into paying them\r\nhefty commissions from money allotted to exigent\r\nhumanitarian aid. This was immediately and from afar -\r\nand, therefore, without proper investigation - denied by\r\ntheir superiors in no uncertain terms.\r\n\r\nThe facts are these: most (though by no means all)\r\nWestern diplomats in the nightmarish wasteland that is\r\nEast Europe and the Balkan, the unctuously fulsome and\r\nthe frowzily wizened alike, are ageing and sybaritic basket\r\ncases. They have often failed miserably in their bootless\r\nprevious posts - or have insufficiently submerged in the\r\nByzantine culture of their employers. Thus emotionally\r\ninjured and cast into the frigorific outer darkness of a\r\nravaged continent, they adopt the imperial patina of\r\nRoman procurators in narcissistic compensation. Their\r\nlong suffering wives - bored to distraction in the\r\nimpassibly catatonic societies of post communism -\r\nimpose upon a reluctant and flummoxed population the\r\nnescient folderol of their distaff voluntary urges or\r\nexiguous artistic talents. Ever more crapulous, they\r\naestivate and hibernate, the queens of tatty courts and\r\nshabby courtiers.\r\n\r\nThe cold war having ebbed, these emissaries of\r\nquestionable provenance engage in the promotion of the\r\nnarrow interests of specific industries or companies. They\r\nlobby the local administration, deploying bare threats and\r\nobloquies where veiled charm fails. They exert subtle or\r\nbrutal pressure through the press. They co-opt name-\r\ndropping bureaucrats and bribe pivotal politicians. They\r\nget fired those who won't collaborate or threaten to expose\r\ntheir less defensible misdeeds. They are glorified delivery\r\nboys, carrying apocryphal messages to and fro. They are\r\nbloviating PR campaigners, seeking to aggrandize their\r\nmeagre role and, incidentally, that of their country. They\r\nwine and dine and banter endlessly with the provincial\r\nsomnolent variety of public figures, members of the venal\r\nand pinchbeck elites that now rule these tortured\r\nterritories. In short - forced to deal with the bedizened\r\nmiscreants that pass for businessmen and politicians in\r\nthis nether world - they are transformed, assuming in the\r\nprocess the identity of their obdurately corrupted hosts.\r\n\r\nThus, they help to sway elections and hasten to endorse\r\ntheir results, however disputed and patently fraudulent.\r\n\r\nThey intimidate the opposition, negotiate with\r\nbusinessmen, prod favoured politicians, spread roorbacks\r\nand perambulate their fiefdom to gather intelligence.\r\n\r\nMore often than not, they cross the limpid lines between\r\npromotion and extortion, lagniappe and pelf, friendship\r\nand collusion, diplomacy and protectorate, the kosher and\r\nthe criminal.\r\n\r\nThey are the target and the address of a legion of\r\npressures and demands. Their government may ask them\r\nto help depose one coalition and help install another.\r\n\r\nTheir secret services - disguised as intrusive NGOs or\r\nworkers at the embassy - often get them involved in shady\r\nacts and unscrupulous practices. Real NGOs ask for their\r\nassiduous assistance and protection. Their hosts - and\r\ncenturies old protocol - expect them to surreptitiously\r\nprovide support while openly refrain from intervening,\r\nmaintaining equipoise. Other countries protest, compete,\r\nor leak damaging reports to an often hostile media. The\r\ntorpid common folk resent them for their colonial ways\r\nand hypocritical demarches. Lacking compunction, they\r\nare nobody's favourites and everybody's scapegoats at one\r\ntime or another.\r\n\r\nAnd they are ill-equipped to deal with these subtleties.\r\n\r\nNot of intelligence, they end where they now are and wish\r\nthey weren't. Ignorant of business and entrepreneurship,\r\nthey occupy the dead end, otiose and pension-orientated\r\njobs they do. Devoid of the charm, negotiating skills and\r\nhuman relations required by the intricacies of their\r\nprofession - they are relegated to the Augean outskirts of\r\ncivilization. Dishonest and mountebank, they persist in\r\ntheir mortifying positions, inured to the conniving they\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nThis blatantly discernible ineptitude provokes the\r\n\"natives\" into a wholesale rejection of the West, its values\r\nand its culture. The envoys are perceived as the cormorant\r\nreification of their remote controllers. Their voluptuary\r\ndecadence is a distant echo of the West's decay, their\r\nnonage greed - a shadow of its avarice, their effrontery\r\nand hidebound peremptory nature - its mien. They are in\r\nno position to preach or teach.\r\n\r\nThe diplomats of the West are not evil. Some of them\r\nmean well. To the best of their oft limited abilities, they\r\ncadge and beg and press and convince their governments\r\nto show goodwill and to contribute to their hosts. But soon\r\ntheir mettle is desiccated by the vexatious realities of their\r\nnew habitation. Reduced to susurrus cynicism and\r\nsardonic contempt, they perfunctorily perform their\r\nfunctions, a distant look in their now empty eyes. They\r\nhave been assimilated, rendered useless to their\r\ndispatchers and to their hosts alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV. Microsoft's Third Front\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Property Wars\r\n\r\n\r\nElated investors greeted chairman Bill Gates and chief\r\nexecutive officer Steve Ballmer for Microsoft's victory in\r\nthe titanic antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the\r\nDepartment of Justice and assorted state attorneys general.\r\n\r\nThey also demanded that Microsoft distribute its pile of\r\ncash - $40 billion in monopoly profits - as dividends.\r\n\r\nBut Microsoft may need that hoard. The battle is far from\r\nover. The European Commission, though much weakened\r\nby recent European Court of First Instance rulings against\r\nits competition commissioner, Mario Monti, can fine the\r\ncompany up to one tenth its worldwide turnover if it finds\r\nagainst it. Microsoft is being investigated by the European\r\nwatchdog for anti-competitive practices now threatening\r\nto spread into the high-end server software and digital\r\nmedia markets.\r\n\r\nBut the software colossus faces an even more daunting\r\nthird front in central and eastern Europe and Asia. It is the\r\nwar against piracy. Both its operating system, Windows,\r\nand its office productivity suite, Office, are widely\r\ncracked and replicated throughout these regions.\r\n\r\nThree years ago, Microsoft negotiated a $3 million\r\nsettlement with the government of Macedonia, one of the\r\nsingle largest abusers of intellectual property rights in this\r\ntiny country. More than 1 percent of Macedonia's GDP is\r\nsaid by various observers to be derived from software and\r\ndigital content piracy.\r\n\r\nAccording to Yugoslavia's news agency, Tanjug, The\r\ngovernments of Serbia and Yugoslavia purchased, last\r\nmonth, 30,000 software licenses from the Redmond giant.\r\n\r\nAnother 10-15,000 are in the pipeline. Aleksandar\r\nBojovic, public relations manager of Microsoft's\r\nrepresentative office in Belgrade was ebullient:\r\n\"Before the signing of an agreement on a strategic\r\npartnership with authorities of Yugoslavia and Serbia, the\r\npercentage of legal software used by the citizens and\r\nindustry of Serbia and Montenegro was only a few\r\npercents. Presently it is about 20 percents. Microsoft is\r\nmore than surprised at the interest for legalization that\r\nexists in Yugoslavia\".\r\n\r\nAccording to the Yugoslav newspaper Danas, Microsoft\r\nYugoslavia has developed versions of Windows and\r\nOffice in Serbian, replete with a spell-checker. There are\r\nc. 1 million computers in Yugoslavia. The company\r\nundertook, last year, to revamp the Yugoslav labyrinthine\r\nhealth, education, customs and tax systems. It also sent\r\nrepresentatives to a delegation of businessmen that visited\r\nBosnia-Herzegovina in February.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft obstinately refused to price its products\r\ndifferentially - to charge less in poorer markets. The\r\nOffice suite costs the equivalent of 6 weeks of the average\r\nwage in Macedonia and a whopping 3 months' wages in\r\nSerbia. This extortionate pricing gave rise to resentment\r\nand thriving markets in pilfered Microsoft applications.\r\n\r\nPirated software costs between $1.5 per compact disk in\r\nMacedonia and $3 in Moscow's immense open-air\r\nGorbushka market.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Russia-based Compulog Computer\r\nConsultants, quoted by USA Today, most communist\r\nstates maintained large-scale hacking operations involving\r\nnot only the security services, but also the computers and\r\nelectrical engineering departments of universities and\r\nprestigious research institutes. American bans on the sale\r\nof certain software applications - such as computer-aided\r\ndesign and encryption - fostered the emergence of an\r\nofficially-sanctioned subculture of crackers and pirates.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years, Russian organized crime has evolved\r\nto incorporate computer fraud, identity theft, piracy of\r\nsoftware and digital media and other related offenses. The\r\nRussian mafia employs programmers and graduates of\r\ncomputer sciences. The British Daily Express reported in\r\nSeptember that - probably Russian - hackers broke into\r\nMicrosoft's computer network and absconded with\r\ninvaluable source codes. These are believed to be now\r\nalso in the possession of the FSB, the chief successor to\r\nRussia's notorious KGB.\r\n\r\nThe Business Software Alliance, a United States based\r\ntrade group, claims that 87-92 percent of all business\r\ncomputer programs used in Russia are bootlegged - a\r\npiracy rate second only to China's. Microsoft sells c. $80-\r\n100 million a year in the Russian Federation and the CIS.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for piracy, its revenues could have\r\nclimbed well above the $1 billion mark.\r\n\r\nAccording to Moscow Times and RosBalt, Microsoft's\r\nsales in Russia almost doubled in the last 12 months and it\r\nhas decided to expand into the regions outlying Moscow\r\nand into Kazakhstan and Ukraine. Yet, the company's\r\nattempts to stamp out illicit copying in the last years of\r\nRussian president Boris Yeltsin's regime - including a\r\nmuch publicized visit by Bill Gates and a series of\r\ntelevised raids on disk stamping factories - floundered and\r\nyielded a wave of xenophobic indignation.\r\n\r\nStill, central and eastern Europe is a natural growth\r\nmarket for the likes of Microsoft. The region is awash\r\nwith highly qualified, talented, and - by Western measure\r\n- sinfully cheap experts. Purchasing power has increased\r\nprecipitously in countries like the Czech Republic,\r\nHungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, parts of Russia, and Croatia.\r\n\r\nBoth governments and businesses are at the initial stages\r\nof investing in information technology infrastructure.\r\n\r\nTechnological leapfrogging rendered certain countries\r\nhere more advanced than the West in terms of broadband\r\nand wireless networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV. NGOs - The Self-Appointed Altruists\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir arrival portends rising local prices and a culture\r\nshock. Many of them live in plush apartments, or five star\r\nhotels, drive SUV's, sport $3000 laptops and PDA's. They\r\nearn a two figure multiple of the local average wage. They\r\nare busybodies, preachers, critics, do-gooders, and\r\nprofessional altruists.\r\n\r\nAlways self-appointed, they answer to no constituency.\r\n\r\nThough unelected and ignorant of local realities, they\r\nconfront the democratically chosen and those who voted\r\nthem into office. A few of them are enmeshed in crime\r\nand corruption. They are the non-governmental\r\norganizations, or NGO's.\r\n\r\nSome NGO's - like Oxfam, Human Rights Watch,\r\nMedecins Sans Frontieres, or Amnesty - genuinely\r\ncontribute to enhancing welfare, to the mitigation of\r\nhunger, the furtherance of human and civil rights, or the\r\ncurbing of disease. Others - usually in the guise of think\r\ntanks and lobby groups - are sometimes ideologically\r\nbiased, or religiously-committed and, often, at the service\r\nof special interests.\r\n\r\nNGO's - such as the International Crisis Group - have\r\nopenly interfered on behalf of the opposition in the last\r\nparliamentary elections in Macedonia. Other NGO's have\r\ndone so in Belarus and Ukraine, Zimbabwe and Israel,\r\nNigeria and Thailand, Slovakia and Hungary - and even in\r\nWestern, rich, countries including the USA, Canada,\r\nGermany, and Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe encroachment on state sovereignty of international\r\nlaw - enshrined in numerous treaties and conventions -\r\nallows NGO's to get involved in hitherto strictly domestic\r\naffairs like corruption, civil rights, the composition of the\r\nmedia, the penal and civil codes, environmental policies,\r\nor the allocation of economic resources and of natural\r\nendowments, such as land and water. No field of\r\ngovernment activity is now exempt from the glare of\r\nNGO's. They serve as self-appointed witnesses, judges,\r\njury and executioner rolled into one.\r\n\r\nRegardless of their persuasion or modus operandi, all\r\nNGO's are top heavy with entrenched, well-remunerated,\r\nextravagantly-perked bureaucracies. Opacity is typical of\r\nNGO's. Amnesty's rules prevent its officials from publicly\r\ndiscussing the inner workings of the organization -\r\nproposals, debates, opinions - until they have become\r\nofficially voted into its Mandate. Thus, dissenting views\r\nrarely get an open hearing.\r\n\r\nContrary to their teachings, the financing of NGO's is\r\ninvariably obscure and their sponsors unknown. The bulk\r\nof the income of most non-governmental organizations,\r\neven the largest ones, comes from - usually foreign -\r\npowers. Many NGO's serve as official contractors for\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nNGO's serve as long arms of their sponsoring states -\r\ngathering intelligence, burnishing their image, and\r\npromoting their interests. There is a revolving door\r\nbetween the staff of NGO's and government bureaucracies\r\nthe world over. The British Foreign Office finances a host\r\nof NGO's - including the fiercely \"independent\" Global\r\nWitness - in troubled spots, such as Angola. Many host\r\ngovernments accuse NGO's of - unwittingly or knowingly\r\n- serving as hotbeds of espionage.\r\n\r\nVery few NGO's derive some of their income from public\r\ncontributions and donations. The more substantial NGO's\r\nspend one tenth of their budget on PR and solicitation of\r\ncharity. In a desperate bid to attract international attention,\r\nso many of them lied about their projects in the Rwanda\r\ncrisis in 1994, recounts \"The Economist\", that the Red\r\nCross felt compelled to draw up a ten point mandatory\r\nNGO code of ethics. A code of conduct was adopted in\r\n1995. But the phenomenon recurred in Kosovo.\r\n\r\nAll NGO's claim to be not for profit - yet, many of them\r\npossess sizable equity portfolios and abuse their position\r\nto increase the market share of firms they own. Conflicts\r\nof interest and unethical behavior abound.\r\n\r\nCafedirect is a British firm committed to \"fair trade\"\r\ncoffee. Oxfam, an NGO, embarked, three years ago, on a\r\ncampaign targeted at Cafedirect's competitors, accusing\r\nthem of exploiting growers by paying them a tiny fraction\r\nof the retail price of the coffee they sell. Yet, Oxfam owns\r\n25% of Cafedirect.\r\n\r\nLarge NGO's resemble multinational corporations in\r\nstructure and operation. They are hierarchical, maintain\r\nlarge media, government lobbying, and PR departments,\r\nhead-hunt, invest proceeds in professionally-managed\r\nportfolios, compete in government tenders, and own a\r\nvariety of unrelated businesses. The Aga Khan Fund for\r\nEconomic Development owns the license for second\r\nmobile phone operator in Afghanistan - among other\r\nbusinesses. In this respect, NGO's are more like cults than\r\nlike civic organizations.\r\n\r\nMany NGO's promote economic causes - anti-\r\nglobalization, the banning of child labor, the relaxing of\r\nintellectual property rights, or fair payment for\r\nagricultural products. Many of these causes are both\r\nworthy and sound. Alas, most NGO's lack economic\r\nexpertise and inflict damage on the alleged recipients of\r\ntheir beneficence. NGO's are at times manipulated by - or\r\ncollude with - industrial groups and political parties.\r\n\r\nIt is telling that the denizens of many developing countries\r\nsuspect the West and its NGO's of promoting an agenda of\r\ntrade protectionism. Stringent - and expensive - labor and\r\nenvironmental provisions in international treaties may\r\nwell be a ploy to fend off imports based on cheap labor\r\nand the competition they wreak on well-ensconced\r\ndomestic industries and their political stooges.\r\n\r\nTake child labor - as distinct from the universally\r\ncondemnable phenomena of child prostitution, child\r\nsoldiering, or child slavery.\r\n\r\nChild labor, in many destitute locales, is all that separates\r\nthe family from all-pervasive, life threatening, poverty. As\r\nnational income grows, child labor declines. Following\r\nthe outcry provoked, in 1995, by NGO's against soccer\r\nballs stitched by children in Pakistan, both Nike and\r\nReebok relocated their workshops and sacked countless\r\nwomen and 7000 children. The average family income -\r\nanyhow meager - fell by 20 percent.\r\n\r\nThis affair elicited the following wry commentary from\r\neconomists Drusilla Brown, Alan Deardorif, and Robert\r\nStern:\r\n\"While Baden Sports can quite credibly claim that their\r\nsoccer balls are not sewn by children, the relocation of\r\ntheir production facility undoubtedly did nothing for their\r\nformer child workers and their families\".\r\n\r\nThis is far from being a unique case. Threatened with\r\nlegal reprisals and \"reputation risks\" (being named-and-\r\nshamed by overzealous NGO's) - multinationals engage in\r\npreemptive sacking. More than 50,000 children in\r\nBangladesh were let go in 1993 by German garment\r\nfactories in anticipation of the American never-legislated\r\nChild Labor Deterrence Act.\r\n\r\nFormer Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich, observed:\r\n\"Stopping child labor without doing anything else could\r\nleave children worse off. If they are working out of\r\nnecessity, as most are, stopping them could force them\r\ninto prostitution or other employment with greater\r\npersonal dangers. The most important thing is that they be\r\nin school and receive the education to help them leave\r\npoverty\".\r\n\r\nNGO-fostered hype notwithstanding, 70% of all children\r\nwork within their family unit, in agriculture. Less than 1\r\npercent are employed in mining and another 2 percent in\r\nconstruction. Again contrary to NGO-proffered panaceas,\r\neducation is not a solution. Millions graduate every year\r\nin developing countries - 100,000 in Morocco alone. But\r\nunemployment reaches more than one third of the\r\nworkforce in places such as Macedonia.\r\n\r\nChildren at work may be harshly treated by their\r\nsupervisors but at least they are kept off the far more\r\nmenacing streets. Some kids even end up with a skill and\r\nare rendered employable.\r\n\"The Economist\" sums up the shortsightedness,\r\ninaptitude, ignorance, and self-centeredness of NGO's\r\nneatly:\r\n\"Suppose that in the remorseless search for profit,\r\nmultinationals pay sweatshop wages to their workers in\r\ndeveloping countries. Regulation forcing them to pay\r\nhigher wages is demanded... The NGOs, the reformed\r\nmultinationals and enlightened rich-country governments\r\npropose tough rules on third-world factory wages, backed\r\nup by trade barriers to keep out imports from countries\r\nthat do not comply. Shoppers in the West pay more - but\r\nwillingly, because they know it is in a good cause. The\r\nNGOs declare another victory. The companies, having\r\nshafted their third-world competition and protected their\r\ndomestic markets, count their bigger profits (higher wage\r\ncosts notwithstanding). And the third-world workers\r\ndisplaced from locally owned factories explain to their\r\nchildren why the West's new deal for the victims of\r\ncapitalism requires them to starve\".\r\n\r\nNGO's in places like Sudan, Somalia, Myanmar,\r\nBangladesh, Pakistan, Albania, and Zimbabwe have\r\nbecome the preferred venue for Western aid - both\r\nhumanitarian and financial - development financing, and\r\nemergency relief. According to the Red Cross, more\r\nmoney goes through NGO's than through the World Bank.\r\n\r\nTheir iron grip on food, medicine, and funds rendered\r\nthem an alternative government - sometimes as venal and\r\ngraft-stricken as the one they replace.\r\n\r\nLocal businessmen, politicians, academics, and even\r\njournalists form NGO's to plug into the avalanche of\r\nWestern largesse. In the process, they award themselves\r\nand their relatives with salaries, perks, and preferred\r\naccess to Western goods and credits. NGO's have evolved\r\ninto vast networks of patronage in Africa, Latin America,\r\nand Asia.\r\n\r\nNGO's chase disasters with a relish. More than 200 of\r\nthem opened shop in the aftermath of the Kosovo refugee\r\ncrisis in 1999-2000. Another 50 supplanted them during\r\nthe civil unrest in Macedonia a year later. Floods,\r\nelections, earthquakes, wars - constitute the cornucopia\r\nthat feed the NGO's.\r\n\r\nNGO's are proponents of Western values - women's lib,\r\nhuman rights, civil rights, the protection of minorities,\r\nfreedom, equality. Not everyone finds this liberal menu\r\npalatable. The arrival of NGO's often provokes social\r\npolarization and cultural clashes. Traditionalists in\r\nBangladesh, nationalists in Macedonia, religious zealots\r\nin Israel, security forces everywhere, and almost all\r\npoliticians find NGO's irritating and bothersome.\r\n\r\nThe British government ploughs well over $30 million a\r\nyear into \"Proshika\", a Bangladeshi NGO. It started as a\r\nwomen's education outfit and ended up as a restive and\r\naggressive women empowerment political lobby group\r\nwith budgets to rival many ministries in this\r\nimpoverished, Moslem and patriarchal country.\r\n\r\nOther NGO's - fuelled by $300 million of annual foreign\r\ninfusion - evolved from humble origins to become mighty\r\ncoalitions of full-time activists. NGO's like the\r\nBangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) and\r\nthe Association for Social Advancement mushroomed\r\neven as their agendas have been fully implemented and\r\ntheir goals exceeded. It now owns and operates 30,000\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nThis mission creep is not unique to developing countries.\r\n\r\nAs Parkinson discerned, organizations tend to self-\r\nperpetuate regardless of their proclaimed charter.\r\n\r\nRemember NATO? Human rights organizations, like\r\nAmnesty, are now attempting to incorporate in their ever-\r\nexpanding remit \"economic and social rights\" - such as\r\nthe rights to food, housing, fair wages, potable water,\r\nsanitation, and health provision. How insolvent countries\r\nare supposed to provide such munificence is conveniently\r\noverlooked.\r\n\"The Economist\" reviewed a few of the more egregious\r\ncases of NGO imperialism.\r\n\r\nHuman Rights Watch lately offered this tortured argument\r\nin favor of expanding the role of human rights NGO's:\r\n\"The best way to prevent famine today is to secure the\r\nright to free expression - so that misguided government\r\npolicies can be brought to public attention and corrected\r\nbefore food shortages become acute.\" It blatantly ignored\r\nthe fact that respect for human and political rights does\r\nnot fend off natural disasters and disease. The two\r\ncountries with the highest incidence of AIDS are Africa's\r\nonly two true democracies - Botswana and South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Centre for Economic and Social Rights, an American\r\noutfit, \"challenges economic injustice as a violation of\r\ninternational human rights law\". Oxfam pledges to\r\nsupport the \"rights to a sustainable livelihood, and the\r\nrights and capacities to participate in societies and make\r\npositive changes to people's lives\". In a poor attempt at\r\nemulation, the WHO published an inanely titled document\r\n- \"A Human Rights Approach to Tuberculosis\".\r\n\r\nNGO's are becoming not only all-pervasive but more\r\naggressive. In their capacity as \"shareholder activists\",\r\nthey disrupt shareholders meetings and act to actively\r\ntarnish corporate and individual reputations. Friends of\r\nthe Earth worked hard four years ago to instigate a\r\nconsumer boycott against Exxon Mobil - for not investing\r\nin renewable energy resources and for ignoring global\r\nwarming. No one - including other shareholders -\r\nunderstood their demands. But it went down well with the\r\nmedia, with a few celebrities, and with contributors.\r\n\r\nAs \"think tanks\", NGO's issue partisan and biased reports.\r\n\r\nThe International Crisis Group published a rabid attack on\r\nthe then incumbent government of Macedonia, days\r\nbefore an election, relegating the rampant corruption of its\r\npredecessors - whom it seemed to be tacitly supporting -\r\nto a few footnotes. On at least two occasions - in its\r\nreports regarding Bosnia and Zimbabwe - ICG has\r\nrecommended confrontation, the imposition of sanctions,\r\nand, if all else fails, the use of force. Though the most\r\nvocal and visible, it is far from being the only NGO that\r\nadvocates \"just\" wars.\r\n\r\nThe ICG is a repository of former heads of state and has-\r\nbeen politicians and is renowned (and notorious) for its\r\nprescriptive - some say meddlesome - philosophy and\r\ntactics. \"The Economist\" remarked sardonically: \"To say\r\n(that ICG) is 'solving world crises' is to risk\r\nunderestimating its ambitions, if overestimating its\r\nachievements\".\r\n\r\nNGO's have orchestrated the violent showdown during the\r\ntrade talks in Seattle in 1999 and its repeat performances\r\nthroughout the world. The World Bank was so intimidated\r\nby the riotous invasion of its premises in the NGO-\r\nchoreographed \"Fifty Years is Enough\" campaign of\r\n1994, that it now employs dozens of NGO activists and let\r\nNGO's determine many of its policies.\r\n\r\nNGO activists have joined the armed - though mostly\r\npeaceful - rebels of the Chiapas region in Mexico.\r\n\r\nNorwegian NGO's sent members to forcibly board\r\nwhaling ships. In the USA, anti-abortion activists have\r\nmurdered doctors. In Britain, animal rights zealots have\r\nboth assassinated experimental scientists and wrecked\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nBirth control NGO's carry out mass sterilizations in poor\r\ncountries, financed by rich country governments in a bid\r\nto stem immigration. NGO's buy slaves in Sudan thus\r\nencouraging the practice of slave hunting throughout sub-\r\nSaharan Africa. Other NGO's actively collaborate with\r\n\"rebel\" armies - a euphemism for terrorists.\r\n\r\nNGO's lack a synoptic view and their work often\r\nundermines efforts by international organizations such as\r\nthe UNHCR and by governments. Poorly-paid local\r\nofficials have to contend with crumbling budgets as the\r\nfunds are diverted to rich expatriates doing the same job\r\nfor a multiple of the cost and with inexhaustible hubris.\r\n\r\nThis is not conducive to happy co-existence between\r\nforeign do-gooders and indigenous governments.\r\n\r\nSometimes NGO's seem to be an ingenious ploy to solve\r\nWestern unemployment at the expense of down-trodden\r\nnatives. This is a misperception driven by envy and\r\navarice.\r\n\r\nBut it is still powerful enough to foster resentment and\r\nworse. NGO's are on the verge of provoking a ruinous\r\nbacklash against them in their countries of destination.\r\n\r\nThat would be a pity. Some of them are doing\r\nindispensable work. If only they were a wee more\r\nsensitive and somewhat less ostentatious. But then they\r\nwouldn't be NGO's, would they?\r\n\r\nInterview granted to Revista Terra, Brazil, September\r\n2005\r\nQ. NGOs are growing quickly in Brazil due to the\r\ndiscredit politicians and governmental institutions face\r\nafter decades of corruption, elitism etc. The young\r\npeople feel they can do something concrete working as\r\nactivists in a NGOs. Isn't that a good thing? What kind\r\nof dangers someone should be aware before enlisting\r\nhimself as a supporter of a NGO?\r\nA. One must clearly distinguish between NGOs in the\r\nsated, wealthy, industrialized West - and (the far more\r\nnumerous) NGOs in the developing and less developed\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nWestern NGOs are the heirs to the Victorian tradition of\r\n\"White Man's Burden\". They are missionary and charity-\r\norientated. They are designed to spread both aid (food,\r\nmedicines, contraceptives, etc.) and Western values. They\r\nclosely collaborate with Western governments and\r\ninstitutions against local governments and institutions.\r\n\r\nThey are powerful, rich, and care less about the welfare of\r\nthe indigenous population than about \"universal\"\r\nprinciples of ethical conduct.\r\n\r\nTheir counterparts in less developed and in developing\r\ncountries serve as substitutes to failed or dysfunctional\r\nstate institutions and services. They are rarely concerned\r\nwith the furthering of any agenda and more preoccupied\r\nwith the well-being of their constituents, the people.\r\n\r\nQ. Why do you think many NGO activists are narcissists\r\nand not altruists? What are the symptoms you identify\r\non them?\r\nA. In both types of organizations - Western NGOs and\r\nNGOs elsewhere - there is a lot of waste and corruption,\r\ndouble-dealing, self-interested promotion, and, sometimes\r\ninevitably, collusion with unsavory elements of society.\r\n\r\nBoth organizations attract narcissistic opportunists who\r\nregards NGOs as venues of upward social mobility and\r\nself-enrichment. Many NGOs serve as sinecures,\r\n\"manpower sinks\", or \"employment agencies\" - they\r\nprovide work to people who, otherwise, are\r\nunemployable. Some NGOs are involved in political\r\nnetworks of patronage, nepotism, and cronyism.\r\n\r\nNarcissists are attracted to money, power, and glamour.\r\n\r\nNGOs provide all three. The officers of many NGOs draw\r\nexorbitant salaries (compared to the average salary where\r\nthe NGO operates) and enjoy a panoply of work-related\r\nperks. Some NGOs exert a lot of political influence and\r\nhold power over the lives of millions of aid recipients.\r\n\r\nNGOs and their workers are, therefore, often in the\r\nlimelight and many NGO activists have become minor\r\ncelebrities and frequent guests in talk shows and such.\r\n\r\nEven critics of NGOs are often interviewed by the media\r\n(laughing).\r\n\r\nFinally, a slim minority of NGO officers and workers are\r\nsimply corrupt. They collude with venal officials to enrich\r\nthemselves. For instance: during the Kosovo crisis in\r\n1999, NGO employees sold in the open market food,\r\nblankets, and medical supplies intended for the refugees.\r\n\r\nQ. How can one choose between good and bad NGOs?\r\nA. There are a few simple tests:\r\n1. What part of the NGO's budget is spent on salaries and\r\nperks for the NGO's officers and employees? The less the\r\nbetter.\r\n2. Which part of the budget is spent on furthering the aims\r\nof the NGO and on implementing its promulgated\r\nprograms? The more the better.\r\n3. What portion of the NGOs resources is allocated to\r\npublic relations and advertising? The less the better.\r\n4. What part of the budget is contributed by governments,\r\ndirectly or indirectly? The less the better.\r\n5. What do the alleged beneficiaries of the NGO's\r\nactivities think of the NGO? If the NGO is feared,\r\nresented, and hated by the local denizens, then something\r\nis wrong!\r\n6. How many of the NGO's operatives are in the field,\r\ncatering to the needs of the NGO's ostensible\r\nconstituents? The more the better.\r\n7. Does the NGO own or run commercial enterprises? If it\r\ndoes, it is a corrupt and compromised NGO involved in\r\nconflicts of interest.\r\n\r\nQ. The way you describe, many NGO are already more\r\npowerful and politically influential than many\r\ngovernments. What kind of dangers this elicits? Do you\r\nthink they are a pest that need control? What kind of\r\ncontrol would that be?\r\nA. The voluntary sector is now a cancerous phenomenon.\r\n\r\nNGOs interfere in domestic politics and take sides in\r\nelection campaigns. They disrupt local economies to the\r\ndetriment of the impoverished populace. They impose\r\nalien religious or Western values. They justify military\r\ninterventions. They maintain commercial interests which\r\ncompete with indigenous manufacturers. They provoke\r\nunrest in many a place. And this is a partial list.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that, as opposed to most governments in the\r\nworld, NGOs are authoritarian. They are not elected\r\ninstitutions. They cannot be voted down. The people have\r\nno power over them. Most NGOs are ominously and\r\ntellingly secretive about their activities and finances.\r\n\r\nLight disinfects. The solution is to force NGOs to become\r\nboth democratic and accountable. All countries and\r\nmultinational organizations (such as the UN) should pass\r\nlaws and sign international conventions to regulate the\r\nformation and operation of NGOs.\r\n\r\nNGOs should be forced to democratize. Elections should\r\nbe introduced on every level. All NGOs should hold\r\n\"annual stakeholder meetings\" and include in these\r\ngatherings representatives of the target populations of the\r\nNGOs. NGO finances should be made completely\r\ntransparent and publicly accessible. New accounting\r\nstandards should be developed and introduced to cope\r\nwith the current pecuniary opacity and operational double-\r\nspeak of NGOs.\r\n\r\nQ. It seems that many values carried by NGO are\r\ntypically modern and Western. What kind of problems\r\nthis creates in more traditional and culturally different\r\ncountries?\r\nA. Big problems. The assumption that the West has the\r\nmonopoly on ethical values is undisguised cultural\r\nchauvinism. This arrogance is the 21st century equivalent\r\nof the colonialism and racism of the 19th and 20th\r\ncentury. Local populations throughout the world resent\r\nthis haughty presumption and imposition bitterly.\r\n\r\nAs you said, NGOs are proponents of modern Western\r\nvalues - democracy, women's lib, human rights, civil\r\nrights, the protection of minorities, freedom, equality. Not\r\neveryone finds this liberal menu palatable. The arrival of\r\nNGOs often provokes social polarization and cultural\r\nclashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII.   Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?\r\n\r\nWho is Guarding the Guards in Countries in Transition from Communism?\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten: August 23, 1999\r\n\r\nIzetbegovic, the nominal president of the nominal Bosnian\r\nstate, the darling of the gullible western media, denies that\r\nhe and his cronies and his cronies' cronies stole 40% of all\r\ncivilian aid targeted at Bosnia - a minor matter of 1 billion\r\nUS dollars and change, in less than 4 years. The tribes of\r\nthe Balkans stop bleeding each other to death only when\r\nthey gang up to bleed another. In this, there are no races\r\nand no traces - everyone is equal under the sign of the\r\ndollar. Serbs, Bosnians and Croats divided the loot with\r\nthe loftiest of egalitarian instincts. Honour among thieves\r\ntransformed into honour among victims and their\r\nmurderers. Mammon is the only real authority in this god\r\nforsaken, writhing rump of a country.\r\n\r\nAnd not only there.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, billions (3 to 5) were transferred to secret off\r\nshore bank accounts to be \"portfolio managed\" by\r\nmysterious fly-by-night entities. Many paid with their jobs\r\nwhen the trail led to the incestuous Yeltsin clan and their\r\nbyzantine court.\r\n\r\nConvoys snake across the mountainous Kosovo, bringing\r\nsmuggled goods at exorbitant prices to the inhabitants of\r\nthis parched territory - all under the avuncular gaze of\r\nmultinational peacekeepers.\r\n\r\nIn Romania, Hungary and Greece, UN forces have been\r\nknown to take bribes to allow goods into besieged Serbia.\r\n\r\nOil, weapons and strategic materials, all slid across this\r\ngreasy channel of the international brotherhood of cash.\r\n\r\nA lot of the aid, ostensibly intended to ameliorate the state\r\nof refugedom imposed upon the unsuspecting, harried\r\npopulation of Kosovo - resurfaced in markets, white and\r\nblack, across the region. Food, blankets, tents, electrical\r\nequipment, even toys - were on offer in bazaars from\r\nSkopje to Podgorica and from Sofia to Thessaloniki,\r\nreplete with the stamps of the unwitting donors. Aid\r\nworkers scurried back and forth in expensive utility\r\nvehicles, buzzing mobile phones in hand and latest model,\r\nofficially purchased, infrared laptops humming in the air\r\nconditioned coolness of their five star hotel rooms (or\r\nfancy apartments). In their back pockets they safeguarded\r\ntheir first class tickets (the food is better and the\r\nstewardesses ...). The scavengers of every carnage, they\r\ndescended upon this tortured land in redundant hordes,\r\nfeeding off the misery, the autoimmune deficiency of the\r\nsyndrome of humanism.\r\n\r\nAsk yourselves: how could one of every 3 dollars - 50%\r\nof GNP - be stolen in a country the size of a tiny\r\nAmerican state - without the knowledge and collaboration\r\nof the international organizations which ostensibly\r\nmanage this bedlam? Why did the IMF renew the credit\r\nlines to a Russia which cheated bold-facely regarding its\r\nforeign exchange reserves? How was Serbia awash and\r\nflush with oil and other goods prohibited under the terms\r\nof the never-ending series of embargoes imposed upon it?\r\nThe answer is that potent cocktail of fear and graft. First\r\ncame fear - that Russia will collapse, that the Balkans will\r\nspill over, that Bosnia will disintegrate. Nuclear\r\nnightmares intermingled with Armenian and Jewish\r\nflashbacks of genocide. The west shut its eyes tight and\r\nthrew money at the bad spirits of irredentism and re-\r\nemergent communism. The long arm of the USA, the\r\n\"international\" financial institutions, collaborated in\r\nconstructing the habit forming dole house that Eastern and\r\nSouthern Europe has become. This conflict-reticence,\r\nthese approach-avoidance cycles led to an inevitable\r\ncollusion between the ruling mob families that pass for\r\nregimes in these parts of the planet - and the unilateral\r\ninstitutions that pass for multilateral ones in the rest of it.\r\n\r\nAn elaborate system of winks and nods, the sign language\r\nof institutional rot and decaying governance, took over.\r\n\r\nGreasy palms clapped one another with the eerie silence\r\nof conspiracy. The world looked away as both -\r\ninternational financial institutions and corrupt regimes -\r\nrobbed their constituencies blind. This was perceived to\r\nbe the inevitable moral cost of stability. Survival of the\r\nmajority entailed the filthy enrichment of the minority.\r\n\r\nAnd the west acquiesced.\r\n\r\nBut this grand design backfired. Like insidious bacteria,\r\ncorruption breeds violence and hops from host to host. It\r\ndoes not discriminate, this plague of black conscience,\r\nbetween east and west. As it infected the indigenous, it\r\nalso effected their guardians. They were all engulfed by\r\nraging greed, by a degradation of the inhibitions and by\r\nthe intoxicating promiscuity of lawlessness. Inebriated by\r\ntheir newly found powers, little ceasars - natives and\r\nfinancial colonialists - claimed their little plots of crime\r\nand avarice, a not so secret order of disintegration of the\r\nsocial fabric. A ghoulish landscape, shrouded in the\r\nopaque mist of the nomenclature, the camaraderie of the\r\nomnipotent.\r\n\r\nAnd corruption bred violence. The Chicago model\r\nimported lock, stock and the barrel of the gun. Former\r\ncronies disappeared mysteriously, bloated corpses in stale\r\nhotel rooms - being the only \"contracts\" honoured.\r\n\r\nTerritories were carved up in constant, unrelenting\r\nwarfare. One billion dollars are worth a lot of blood and it\r\nwas spilled with glee, with the enthusiasm of the\r\ninevitable, with the elation of gambling all on a single\r\nspin of the Russian roulette.\r\n\r\nIt is this very violence that the west tried to drown with its\r\ncredits. But unbeknownst to it, this very violence thrived\r\non these pecuniary fertilizers. A plant of horrors, it\r\ndevoured its soil and its cultivators alike. And 120,000\r\npeople paid with their lives for this wrong gamble.\r\n\r\nCounting its losses, the west is poised to spin the wheel\r\nagain. More money is amassed, the dies are cast and more\r\npeople cast to die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII.  The Honorary Academic Higher Education for Sale\r\n\r\nIn Countries in Transition from Communism\r\n\r\nMira Markovic is an \"Honorary Academic\" of the Russian\r\nAcademy of Science. It cost a lot of money to obtain this\r\ntitle and the Serb multi-billionnaire Karic was only too\r\nglad to cough it up. Whatever else you say about Balkan\r\ncronies, they rarely bite the hand that feeds them (unless\r\nand until it is expedient to do so). And whatever else you\r\nsay about Russia, it adapted remarkably to capitalism.\r\n\r\nEverything has a price and a market. Israel had to learn\r\nthis fact the hard way when Russian practical-nurse-level\r\nmedical doctors and construction-worker-level civil\r\nengineers flooded its shores. Everything is for sale in this\r\nregion of opportunities, instant education inclusive.\r\n\r\nIt seems that academe suffered the most during the\r\nnumerous shock therapies and transition periods showered\r\nupon the impoverished inhabitants of Eastern and Central\r\nEurope. The resident of decrepit communist-era buildings,\r\nit had to cope with a flood of eager students and a deluge\r\nof anachronistic \"scholars\". But in Russia, the CIS and the\r\nBalkans the scenery is nothing short of Dantesque.\r\n\r\nUnschooled in any major European language, lazily\r\ncontent with their tenured positions, stagnant and formal -\r\nthe academics and academicians of the Balkans are both\r\nfailures and a resounding indictment of the rigor mortis\r\nthat was socialism. Economics textbooks stop short of\r\nmentioning Friedman or Phelps. History textbooks should\r\nbetter be relegated to the science fiction shelves. A brave\r\nfacade of self sufficiency covers up a vast hinterland of\r\ninferiority complex fully supported by real inferiority. In\r\nantiquated libraries, shattered labs, crooked buildings and\r\ninadequate facilities, student pursue redundant careers\r\nwith the wrong teachers.\r\n\r\nCorruption seethes under this repellent surface. Teachers\r\nsell exams, take bribes, trade incestuous sex with their\r\nstudents. They refuse to contribute to their communities.\r\n\r\nIn all my years in the Balkans, I have yet to come across a\r\nvoluntary act - a single voluntary act - by an academic.\r\n\r\nAnd I have come across numerous refusals to help and to\r\ncontribute. Materialism incarnate.\r\n\r\nThis sorry state of affairs has a twofold outcome. On the\r\none hand, herds of victims of rigidly dictated lectures and\r\nthe suppression of free thought. These academic products\r\nsuffer from the twin afflictions of irrelevance of skills and\r\nthe inability to acquire relevant ones, the latter being the\r\nresult of decades of brainwashing and industrial\r\neducational methods. Unable to match their anyhow\r\noutdated knowledge with anything a modern marketplace\r\ncan offer - they default on to menial jobs, rebel or pull\r\nlevers to advance in life. Which leads us to the death of\r\nmeritocracy and why this region's future is behind it.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the downfall of all the major ideologies of\r\nthe 20th century - Fascism, Communism, etc. the New\r\nOrder, heralded by President Bush, emerged as a battle of\r\nOpen Club versus Closed Club societies, at least from the\r\neconomic point of view.\r\n\r\nAll modern states and societies must choose whether to be\r\ngoverned by merit (meritocracy) or by the privileged few\r\n(oligarchy). It is inevitable that the social and economic\r\nstructures be controlled by elites. It is a complex world\r\nand only a few can master the knowledge it takes to\r\ngovern effectively. What sets meritocracy apart is not the\r\nnumber of members of its ruling (or leading) class,\r\nusually no larger than an oligarchy. No, it is distinguished\r\nby its membership criteria and by the mode of their\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nThe meritocratic elite is an open club because it satisfies\r\nthree conditions:\r\n1. The process and rules of joining up (i.e., the\r\ncriteria) are transparent and widely known.\r\n2. The application and membership procedures are\r\nuniform, equal to all and open to continuous public\r\nscrutiny and criticism.\r\n3. The system alters its membership requirements in\r\ndirect response to public feedback and to the\r\nchanging social and economic environment.\r\n\r\nTo belong to a meritocracy one needs to satisfy a series of\r\ndemands, whose attainment is entirely up to he individual.\r\n\r\nAnd that is all that one needs to do. The rules of joining\r\nand of membership are cast in iron. The wishes and\r\nopinions of those who happen to comprise the club at any\r\ngiven moment are of no importance and of no\r\nconsequence. Meritocracy is a \"fair play\" by rules of equal\r\nchance to derive benefits. Put differently, is the rule of\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nTo join a meritocratic club, one needs to demonstrate that\r\none is in possession of, or has access to, \"inherent\"\r\nparameters, such as intelligence, a certain level of\r\neducation, a potential to contribute to society. An inherent\r\nparameter must correspond to a criterion and the latter\r\nmust be applied independent of the views and\r\npredilections of those who sometimes are forced to apply\r\nit. The members of a committee or a board can disdain an\r\napplicant, or they might wish not to approve a candidate.\r\n\r\nOr they may prefer someone else for the job because they\r\nowe her something, or because they play golf with him.\r\n\r\nYet, they are permitted to consider only the applicant's or\r\nthe candidate's \"inherent\" parameters: does he have the\r\nnecessary tenure, qualifications, education, experience?\r\nDoes he contribute to his workplace, community, society\r\nat large? In other words: is he \"worthy\" or \"deserving\"?\r\nNot WHO he is - but WHAT he is.\r\n\r\nGranted, these processes of selection, admission,\r\nincorporation and assimilation are administered by mere\r\nhumans and are, therefore, subject to human failings. Can\r\nqualifications be always judged \"objectively,\r\nunambiguously and unequivocally\"? Can \"the right\r\npersonality traits\" or \"the ability to engage in teamwork\"\r\nbe evaluated \"objectively\"? These are vague and\r\nambiguous enough to accommodate bias and bad will.\r\n\r\nStill, at least appearances are kept in most cases - and\r\ndecisions can be challenged in courts.\r\n\r\nWhat characterizes oligarchy is the extensive, relentless\r\nand ruthless use of \"transcendent\" (in lieu of \"inherent\")\r\nparameters to decide who will belong where, who will get\r\nwhich job and, ultimately, who will enjoy which benefits.\r\n\r\nThe trouble with transcendent parameters is that there is\r\nnothing much an applicant or a candidate can do about\r\nthem. Usually, they are accidents, occurrences absolutely\r\nbeyond the reach or control of those most affected by\r\nthem. Race is such a transcendent parameter and so are\r\ngender, familial affiliation or contacts and influence.\r\n\r\nIn many corners of the globe, to join a closed, oligarchic\r\nclub, to get the right job, to enjoy excessive benefits - one\r\nmust be white (racism), male (sexual discrimination), born\r\nto the right family (nepotism), or to have the right political\r\n(or other) contacts (cronyism). And often, belonging to\r\none such club is the prerequisite for joining another.\r\n\r\nIn France, for instance, the whole country is politically\r\nand economically run by graduates of the Ecole Normale\r\nd'Administration (ENA). They are known as the\r\nENArques (=the royal dynasty of ENA graduates).\r\n\r\nThe privatization of state enterprises in most East and\r\nCentral European countries provided a glaring example of\r\noligarchic machinations. In most of these countries (the\r\nCzech Republic, Macedonia, Serbia and Russia are\r\nnotorious examples) - state companies, the nation's only\r\nassets, were \"sold\" to political cronies, creating in the\r\nprocess a pernicious amalgam of capitalism and oligarchy,\r\nknown as \"crony capitalism\" or privateering. The national\r\nwealth was passed on to the hands of relatively few, well\r\nconnected, individuals, at a ridiculously low price. The\r\nnations involved were robbed, their riches either\r\nsquandered or smuggled abroad.\r\n\r\nIn the affairs of humans, not everything falls neatly into\r\nplace. Take money, for instance. Is it an inherent\r\nparameter or an expressly transcendent one? Making\r\nmoney indicates the existence of some merit, some\r\ninherent advantageous traits of the money-making\r\nindividual. To make money consistently, a person needs\r\nto be diligent, resilient, hard working, to prevail and\r\novercome hardships, to be far sighted and to possess a\r\nhost of other - universally acclaimed - traits. On the other\r\nhand, is it fair when someone who made his fortune\r\nthrough corruption, inheritance, or luck - be preferred to a\r\npoor genius?\r\nThat is a contentious issue. In the USA money talks.\r\n\r\nBeing possessed of money means being virtuous and\r\nmeritorious. To preserve a fortune inherited is as difficult\r\na task as to make it in the first place, the thinking goes.\r\n\r\nThus, the source of the money is secondary.\r\n\r\nAn oligarchy tends to have long term devastating\r\neconomic effects.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the best and the brightest - when shut\r\nout by the members of the ruling elites - emigrate. In a\r\ncountry where one's job is determined by his family\r\nconnections or by influence peddling - those best fit to do\r\nthe job are likely to be disappointed, then disgusted and\r\nthen to leave the place altogether.\r\n\r\nThis is the phenomenon known as \"Brain Drain\". It is one\r\nof the biggest migratory tidal waves in human history.\r\n\r\nCapable, well-trained, educated, young people leave their\r\noligarchic, arbitrary, influence peddling societies and\r\nmigrate to less arbitrary meritocracies (mostly to be found\r\nin what is collectively known as \"The West\").\r\n\r\nThis is colonialism of the worst kind. The mercantilist\r\ndefinition of a colony is a territory which exports raw\r\nmaterials only to re-import them in the form of finished\r\nproducts. The Brain drain is exactly that: the poorer\r\ncountries are exporting raw brains and buying back the\r\nfinished products masterminded, invented and\r\nmanufactured by theses brains.\r\n\r\nYet, while in classical colonialism, the colony at least\r\nreceived some recompense for its goods - here the poor\r\ncountry is actually the poorer for its exports. The bright\r\nyoung people who depart (most of them never to return)\r\ncarry with them an investment of the scarce resources of\r\ntheir homeland - and award it to their new, much richer,\r\nhost countries. This is an absurd situation, a subsidy\r\ngranted reluctantly by the poor to the rich. This is also one\r\nof the largest capital transfers (really capital flight) in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nSome poor countries understood these basic, unpleasant,\r\nfacts of life. They extracted an \"education fee\" from those\r\nemigrating. This fee was supposed to, at least partially,\r\nrecapture the costs of educating and training the\r\nimmigrants. Romania and the USSR imposed such levies\r\non Jews emigrating to Israel in the 1970s. Others\r\ndespairingly regard the brain drain as a natural\r\ncatastrophe. Very few countries are trying to tackle the\r\nfundamental, structural and philosophical flaws of the\r\nsystem, the roots of the disenchantment of those who\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nThe Brain Drain is so serious that some countries lost up\r\nto a third of their total young and educated population to it\r\n(Macedonia in South-eastern Europe, some less developed\r\ncountries in South East Asia and in Africa). Others were\r\ndrained of almost one half of the growth in their educated\r\nworkforce (for instance, Israel during the 1980s).\r\n\r\nBrains are an ideal natural resource: they can be\r\ncultivated, directed, controlled, manipulated, regulated.\r\n\r\nThey are renewable and replicable. Brains tend to grow\r\nexponentially through interaction and they have an\r\nunparalleled economic value added. The profit margin in\r\nknowledge and information related industries far exceeds\r\nanything common to more traditional, second wave,\r\nindustries (not to mention first wave agriculture and\r\nagribusiness).\r\n\r\nWhat is even more important:\r\nPoor countries are uniquely positioned to take advantage\r\nof this third revolution. With cheap, educated workforce -\r\nthey can monopolize basic data processing and\r\ntelecommunications functions worldwide. True, this calls\r\nfor massive initial investments in physical infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBut the important input is the wetware, the brains. To\r\nconstrain them, to disappoint them, to make them run\r\naway, to more merit-orientated places - is to sentence\r\noneself to a permanent disadvantage and deprivation.\r\n\r\nThis is what the countries in the Balkans are doing.\r\n\r\nDriving away the best part of their population by\r\nencouraging the worst part. Abandoning their future by\r\ndwelling on their past. Caught in a fatal spider web of\r\nfamily connections and political cronyism of their own\r\ndesign. Their factories and universities and offices and\r\ngovernment filled to the brim with third rate relatives of\r\nthird rate professors and bureaucrats. Turning themselves\r\ninto third rate countries in a self perpetuating, self feeding\r\nprocess of decline. And all the while eyeing the new and\r\nthe foreign with the paranoia that is the result of true guilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII.  Rasputin in Transition\r\n\r\nFrauds and Con-men in Countries in Transition from Communism\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mad glint in his eyes is likely to be nothing more\r\nominous than maladjusted contact lenses. If not clean\r\nshaven, he is likely to sport nothing wilder than a goatee.\r\n\r\nMore likely an atheist than a priest, this mutation of the\r\nageless confidence artist is nonetheless the direct spiritual\r\ndescendent of Rasputin, the raving maniac who governed\r\nRussia until his own execution by Russian noblemen and\r\npatriots.\r\n\r\nThey are to be found in all countries in transition. Wild\r\nand insidious weeds, the outcome of wayward pollination\r\nby mutated capitalism. They prey on their victims, at first\r\nacquiring their confidence and love, then penetrating their\r\npolitical, social and financial structures almost as a virus\r\nwould: stealthily and treacherously. By the time their\r\nquarry wakes up to its infection and subjugation - it is\r\nalready too late. By then, the invader will have become\r\npart of the invaded or its master, either through blackmail\r\nor via tempting subornation.\r\n\r\nThis region of the CEE and the Balkans provides for\r\nfertile grounds. It is a Petrie dish upon which cultures of\r\ncorruption and scandalous conduct are fermented. The\r\ntypical exploiter of these vulnerabilities is a foreigner.\r\n\r\nThings foreign are held in awe and adulation by a\r\npopulace so down trodden and made to feel inferior in\r\nevery way, not least by foreign tutors and advisors. The\r\ncraving to be loved, this gnawing urge to be accepted, to\r\nbe a member of the club, to be distinguished from one's\r\nformer neighbours - are irresistible. The modern Rasputin\r\ndoles out this unconditional acceptance, this all\r\nencompassing affinity, the echoes of avuncularity. In\r\ndoing so, he evokes in the recipients such warmth, such\r\nrelief, such fervour and reciprocity - that he becomes an\r\nidol, a symbol of a paradise long lost, a golden braid.\r\n\r\nHaving thus completed the first phase of his meticulous\r\nattack - he moves on to the second chapter in this book of\r\nbody snatching.\r\n\r\nArmed with his new-fangled popularity, the crook moves\r\non and leverages it to the hilt. He does so by feigning\r\ncharity, by faking interest, by false \"constructive\r\ncriticism\". To his slow forming army, he recruits the\r\nmedia, the flower children, the bleeding hearts, reformers,\r\ndissidents and the occasional freak. By holding old\r\nauthority in disdain, by declaring his contempt for the\r\nmethods of the \"tried and true\", by appearing to make war\r\nupon all rot and immorality - this creature of expediency\r\nemerges as a folk hero. It is the more cynical and world\r\nweary and \"sophisticated\" members of society that lead\r\nthe way, succumbing to his ardour and conviction, to his\r\nchild-like innocence, to his unwavering agenda. He\r\ncleverly thrusts at them the double edge of their own\r\ndisillusionment and disappointment. Thus mirrored, they\r\nare transformed and converted into his camp of renewal\r\nand clean promises by this epiphany. They hand him the\r\nkeys to every medium, the very codes and secrets that\r\nmake him so powerful. They pledge their alliance and\r\nallegiance and render to him the access they possess to the\r\nnerve centres of society. The castle gates thus opened\r\nfrom inside, his victory assured, the rogue moves on to\r\nconsummate this unholy marriage between himself and\r\nthe deceived.\r\n\r\nAlways in fear of light, he surreptitiously and cunningly\r\nbegins to interact with the foci of power and money in the\r\nland. However loathsome he is to them, however\r\nrepulsive the experience, however undesirable the effects\r\nof their surrender - they are made to recognize him as\r\ntheir equal. With the might of the media and a large part\r\nof the people behind him, he can no longer be ignored.\r\n\r\nTheir conspiracy-prone mind, awash with superstitions\r\nand its attaching phobias, tries to comprehend his\r\nmeteoric rise, the forcefulness with which he treads, his\r\nunmitigated, inane, self confidence. Is he a spy? A\r\nmember of a secret order? The latent agent of a\r\nhyperpower? The heart of a world conspiracy? Has he no\r\nfear of retribution and no remorse? Before this great\r\nunknown, they kneel and yield, an atavistic reaction to\r\natavistic fears. Now all doors are thrown open, all deals\r\nare made available, all secrets are revealed. The more he\r\nlearns, the mightier he becomes - the more his might, the\r\nmore he learns. To him, a virtuous cycle, to his hosts - a\r\nvicious one.\r\n\r\nIn all this tumult, he does not lose sight of his original\r\ngoals - power, money, fame, all three. It is a relentless\r\npursuit, an obsessive hunt, a ruthless and unscrupulous\r\nchase. In his war, no prisoners are taken, no price too\r\ndear, no human in his orbit left untouched. He will\r\nmanipulate and threat and beg and promise and plead and\r\nblackmail and extort to accomplish that which he set out\r\nto achieve: decision making powers, wealth, clout,\r\nexposure and resultant fame. It is at this stage that the\r\nlatter day Rasputin emerges from the shadows and joins\r\nofficialdom or concludes lucrative transactions based on\r\nfavourably deflated prices and insider dealing. By now,\r\nhis shady past is no longer a hindrance. His prowess far\r\nexceeds his invidious biography. Well installed, he\r\nignores both media and the people. He brushes aside\r\ncontemptuously all criticism and enquiry. His true,\r\nnarcissistic, face is exposed and it is hideous to behold.\r\n\r\nBut there is nothing to be done and all resistance is futile.\r\n\r\nThe con-man now is in a haste to maximize his hard\r\nearned profits and exit the scene, on his way to another\r\nrealm of guile and naivet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIX. The Eureka Connection\r\n\r\nHow East and Central Europeans Defraud the Gullible West\r\n\r\n\r\nA common, guttural cry of \"Eureka\" echoed as the\r\npeoples of East Europe and the Balkan emerged from the\r\nCommunist steam bath. It was at once an expression of\r\njoy and disbelief. That the West should be willing to\r\nbankroll the unravelling of a failed social experiment,\r\nfreely entered into, exceeded the wildest imaginings. That\r\nit would do so indefinitely and with no strings attached\r\nwas a downright outlandish fortuity.\r\n\r\nTransition in the post communist countries was coupled\r\nwith a hubristic and haughty conviction in the\r\ntransforming powers of the Western values, Western\r\ntechnology, and Western economics. The natives - awe\r\nstruck and grateful - were supposed to assimilate these\r\nendowments and thus become honorary Westerners\r\n(\"white men\"). Where osmosis and immitation failed -\r\nbayonets and bombs were called upon. These were later\r\nreplaced by soft credits and economic micromanagement\r\nby a host of multilateral institutions.\r\n\r\nAccustomed to Pavolvian interactions, adept at\r\nmanipulating \"the system\", experts in all manner of make\r\nbelief - the shrewd denizens of the East exercised the\r\nreflexive levers of the Great Democracies. They adopted\r\nstratagems whose sole purpose was to extract additional\r\naid, to foster a dependency of giving, to emotionally\r\nextort. In one sentence: they learned how to corrupt the\r\ndonors.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious subterfuge involved the mindless\r\nrepetition of imported mantras. Possessed of the same\r\nglazed eyes and furled lips, the loyal members of a\r\nperfidious nomenklatura uttered with the same seemingly\r\nperfervid conviction the catechism of a new religion.\r\n\r\nYesterday communism - today capitalism, unblushingly,\r\nunhesitatingly, cynically. Yesterday, a recondite\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat or, more often, a personality\r\ncult - today \"democracy\". Yesterday - brotherhood and\r\nunity, today - genocidal \"self determination\". Yesterday -\r\ngenocidal inclinations, today - a \"growth and stability\r\npact\". If required to bark in the nude in order to secure the\r\nflow of unsupervised funding (mainly to their pockets),\r\nthese besuited \"gentlemen\" would have done so with self-\r\nsacrificial ardour, no doubt.\r\n\r\nWhen it dawned upon them that the West is willing to pay\r\nfor every phase of self-betterment, for every stage of self-\r\nimprovement, for every functioning institution and law\r\npassed - this venal class (the soi-disant \"elite\" in\r\ngovernment, in industry and academe) embarked on a\r\ngargantuan blackmail plot. The inventors of the most\r\ncontorted and impervious bureaucracies ever, have\r\nrecreated them. They have transformed the simplest tasks\r\nof reform into tortuous, hellish processes, mired in a\r\nmiasma of numerous committees and deluged by cavils,\r\ncaptious \"working\" papers and memoranda of stupefying\r\ntrumpery. They have stalled and retraced, reversed and\r\nregressed, opined and debated, refused and accepted\r\ngrudgingly. The very processes of transformation and\r\ntransition - a simulacrum to begin with - acquired an  aura\r\nof somnolent lassitude and the nightmarish quality of\r\nensnarement. And they made the West bribe them into\r\nyielding that which was ostensibly in their very own\r\ninterest. Every act of legislation was preceded and\r\nfollowed by dollops of foreign cash. Every ministry\r\nabolished was conditioned upon more aid. Every court\r\nestablished, every bloodletting firm privatized, every bank\r\nsold, every system made more efficient, every procedure\r\nsimplified, every tender concluded and every foreign\r\ninvestor spared - had a tariff. \"Pay or else ...\" was the\r\novert message - and the West preferred to pay and to\r\nappease, as it has always done.\r\n\r\nThe money lavished on these \"new democracies\" was\r\nrouted rather conspicuously into the private bank accounts\r\nof the thin layer of vituperable \"leaders\", \"academics\" and\r\n\"businessmen\" (often the same people). One third\r\ncigarette smugglers, one third uncommon criminals and\r\none third cynical con-artists, these people looted the\r\ncoffers of their states. The IMF - this sanctuary of fourth\r\nrate economists from third world countries, as I am never\r\nwont of mentioning - collaborated with the US\r\ngovernment, the European Union and the World Bank in\r\ncovering up this stark reality. They turned a common\r\nblind eye to the diversion of billions in aid and credits to\r\nmysterious bank accounts in dubious tax havens. They\r\nignored fake trading deals, itinerant investment houses,\r\nshady investors and shoddy accounting. They expressed\r\nmerely polite concern over blatant cronyism and rampant\r\nnepotism. They kept pouring money into the rapidly\r\ngrowing black hole that Eastern Europe and the Balkan\r\nhave become. They pretended not to know and feigned\r\nsurprise when confronted with the facts. In their\r\ncomplicity, they have encouraged the emergence of a\r\ncriminal class of unprecedented proportions, hold and\r\npenetration in many of the countries within their remit.\r\n\r\nTo qualify to participate in this grand larceny, one needed\r\nonly to have a \"sovereign\" \"state\". Sovereign states are\r\nentitled to hold shares in multilateral financial institutions\r\nand to receive international aid and credits. In other\r\nwords: sovereignty is the key to instant riches. The\r\nunregenerate skulks that pass for political parties in many\r\ncountries in East Europe and the Balkan (though not in all\r\nof them - there are exceptions), carved up the territory.\r\n\r\nThis led to a suspicious proliferation of \"republics\", each\r\nwith its own access to international funds. It also led to\r\n\"wars\" among these emergent entities.\r\n\r\nRecent revelations regarding the close and cordial co-\r\noperation between Croatia's late president, Franjo\r\nTudjman and Yugoslavia's current strongman, Slobodan\r\nMilosevic - ostensibly, bitter enemies - expose the role\r\nthat warfare and instability played in increasing the flow\r\nof aid (both civil and military) to belligerent countries.\r\n\r\nThe more unstable the region, the more ominous its\r\nrhetoric, the more fractured its geopolitics - the more\r\nmoney flowed in. It was the right kind of money:\r\nmultilateral - not multinational, public - not private,\r\ndeliberately ignorant - not judiciously cognizant. It was\r\nthe \"quantum fund\" - capable of \"tunnelling\" (as the\r\nCzechs called it) - vanishing in one place (the public\r\npurse) and appearing in another (the private wallet)\r\nsimultaneously. Even the exception - the never-enforced\r\nsanctions against Yugoslavia - served to enrich its\r\ncankerous ruling class by way of smuggling and\r\nmonopolies.\r\n\r\nAnd why did the West collaborate in this charade? Why\r\ndid it compromise its goodwill, its carefully crafted\r\ninstitutions, its principles and ethos? The short and the\r\nlong of it is: to get rid of a nuisance at a minimal cost. It is\r\nmuch cheaper to grease the palms of a deciding few - than\r\nto embark on the winding path of true and painful growth.\r\n\r\nIt is more convenient to co-opt a political leader than to\r\nconfront an angry mob. It is by far easier to throw money\r\nat a problem than to solve it.\r\n\r\nIt was not a sinister conspiracy of the Great Powers as\r\nmany would have it. Nor was it the result of foresight,\r\ninsight, perspicacity, or planning. It was a typical\r\nimprovident European default, adopted by a succession of\r\nlacklustre and lame American administrations. It enriched\r\nthe few and impoverished the many. It fostered anti-\r\nWestern sentiments. It provoked skirmishes that provoked\r\nwars that led to massacres. To reverse it would require\r\nmore resources than should have been committed in the\r\nfirst place. These are not forthcoming. The West is again\r\nmisleading and deceiving and collaborating to defraud the\r\npeoples of these unfortunate netherlands. It again\r\npromises prosperity it cannot deliver, growth it will not\r\nguarantee and stability it cannot ensure. This\r\nprestidigitation is bound to lead to ever larger bills and to\r\nthe attrition of good will of both donor and recipient.\r\n\r\nNever before was such a unique historical opportunity so\r\nthoroughly missed. The consequences may well be as\r\nunprecedented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL.  The Treasure Trove of Kosovo\r\n\r\nNothing like a juicy, photogenic human catastrophe to\r\nenrich corrupt politicians and bottom-line-orientated,\r\nstock-option-motivated corporate executives. The Balkan\r\nis teeming with both these sad days.\r\n\r\nEven as the war was raging, shortages of food and other\r\nsupplies led to the dispensation of political favours (in the\r\nform of import licences, for instance) to the chosen few.\r\n\r\nBulgarian, Greek and Albanian firms, owned by ruthless\r\ncriminals and criminals-turned-politicians benefited\r\nmightily. Millions were made and shared as artificially\r\nhigh prices were maintained by various means while\r\ncronies and crime controlled firms shared the spoils. This\r\norgiastic intercourse between the corrupt and the criminal\r\nwas not confined to one country. The whole region\r\npartook in robbing the most impoverished populations in\r\nEurope by \"legal\" means.\r\n\r\nTheir more refined and perfumed Western brethren were\r\nnever far behind in taking advantage of American largesse\r\non the one hand and re-emerging alarmist tendencies, on\r\nthe other. Thus, American, German, Greek, French and\r\nItalian firms enjoyed funds allocated to international\r\nhumanitarian aid by the likes of the US government, the\r\nUnited Nations, the World Bank, the IMF and other long\r\narms of the American octopus. Defence contractors and\r\nthe dubious characters known as weapons intermediaries\r\nstoked the atavistic fires of war in securing defence\r\ncontracts. And aid workers resided in six star hotels,\r\ndriving the latest sports utility vehicles and brandishing\r\nfuturistic laptop computers as they went about the\r\nbusiness of dispensing aid. In the meantime, at least one\r\nhalf of all aid money was pilfered - not to use a harsher\r\nterm. Aid rations were freely available in Macedonian,\r\nAlbanian, Greek and Bulgarian markets - offered at a\r\ndiscount by aid workers who stole them from their\r\nsupposed recipients. The refugees were never given\r\nmattresses, were short of blankets, water, showers and\r\ntoilets (I visited the camps - this is an eyewitness\r\naccount). Only bread was abundant.\r\n\r\nNow that the war is over, some people are counting their\r\ndead - while others are counting their blessings. But this\r\nhas all been a prelude. It is the next wave of aid which is\r\nthe main course in this bacchanalia. Outlandishly feverish\r\nnumbers are tossed around. Kosovo's immediate\r\nreconstruction (housing and infrastructure) will require\r\nwell over 2 billion US dollars in the next 2 years. Of this,\r\n1.5 billion dollars has already been raised. A further 2\r\nbillion USD is slated as direct aid to the shattered\r\neconomies of Macedonia and Albania. But the real booty\r\nlies in Serbia. A minimum of 10-13 billion dollars will be\r\nrequired simply to restore Serbia's infrastructure to its\r\nformer, inglorious self. To resuscitate the whole\r\nlanguishing area, a staggering 30 billion dollars is touted\r\nas the minimal bill.\r\n\r\nRest assured that at least one third of this generous\r\ncornucopia will end up lining the pockets of the rich and\r\nmighty. At least 1 billion dollars will end up festering in\r\nSwiss, Cypriot, South African and Israeli bank accounts.\r\n\r\nThe politicians know it, the \"grupirovki\" (business cartels\r\ncontrolled by mafia-style organizations) know it, Western\r\ngovernments know it. This is the REAL stability pact.\r\n\r\nFinancially inebriated politicians are better motivated to\r\nmaintain peace and stability, or so the thinking goes.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Balkans will play a major role in\r\ndetermining the topography and geography of this flood\r\nof cronyism, nepotism, criminality and vice. The Balkan\r\nis composed of states run by crime organizations and\r\ncrime organizations run by states. Old alliances last long\r\n(as opposed to the Middle East where alliances, dune-like,\r\nshift with the winds). Bulgaria and Macedonia, for\r\ninstance. Serbia and Greece. Albania and Kosovo. And\r\nnow Albania and Macedonia. Meetings of regional\r\n\"leaders\" in the Balkans were always reminiscent of\r\nscenes from \"The Godfather\". The dons, uncomfortably\r\nclad in expensive business suits and wearing golden rings,\r\ndeciding life and death and a jovial yet vaguely menacing\r\natmosphere. Only the leaders of the New Balkans are\r\nmuch younger, less experienced, more prone to\r\nsuperstition, extremism and moodiness. The old tension\r\nare bound to re-emerge, this time in the employ of\r\nbusiness interests. Expect a flare up of animosity between\r\nGreece and Macedonia. Despite its Bulgarophile regime,\r\nexpect uneasy moments between Bulgaria and Macedonia.\r\n\r\nAnd expect an unholy alliance of business interests\r\nbetween Mr. Thaci and his sprawling business empire and\r\nthe governments of Albania and Macedonia. If not\r\nassassinated before, Thaci is definitely the Man to watch.\r\n\r\nYoung, well educated, ruthless, involved in business\r\n(read: corrupt to the core) - an aptly dangerous man in\r\ndangerous times.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that everyone hold high expectations. This\r\nis a poor recipe for an amicable carving of the cake of\r\ninternational funding. Macedonia expects to lead the\r\nreconstruction effort of Kosovo. It was offended greatly\r\nby the decision to base the Kosovo reconstruction agency\r\nin Pristina. Greek and Italian firms expect to snatch profits\r\nout of the jaws of their near treacherous behaviour during\r\nthe war. Turkish firms except to be rewarded for the\r\nloyalty of Turkey during the same. American and German\r\nfirms expect to exclude all else in gaining access to\r\nAmerican and German (=EU) funds (as they have done in\r\nBosnia). These all are mutually incompatible expectations\r\nand they will lead to mutually exclusive behaviour.\r\n\r\nExpect some very ugly scenes, including spilt doses of\r\nthis cheap, red liquid, blood.\r\n\r\nAlbania, already governed by the ungovernable crime\r\ngangs it spawned in the last few years, has formed an\r\nalliance with the KLA, never a moral standard-bearer.\r\n\r\nThis expanded amusement park of drug trafficking,\r\nprostitution, weapons smuggling, contraband and much\r\nworse is now threatening to take over its more virtuous\r\n(though by no means virginal) neighbour, Macedonia. A\r\nflare up of hitherto unimaginable brotherly love has\r\nindicated this sacrilegious rapprochement. The\r\nMacedonian Prime Minister - encumbered by a\r\ndemanding Albanian coalition partner - has met Thaci and\r\nthe encounter had all the trappings of a state visit. Soon\r\nafter senior albanian politicians started talking about a\r\nMacedonian recognition of an independent state of\r\nKosovo and an Albanian language university (the reason\r\nfor student riots just two years before).\r\n\r\nTo a large extent, the Kosovo war was a gang warfare.\r\n\r\nThe Serb criminal organization known as Yugoslavia\r\nagainst the Albanian gang known as the KLA. It was a\r\nwar over turf and lucrative businesses. In what used to be\r\nthe Third World and moreso in the post-communist\r\ncountries in transition, criminal activities often\r\naccompany \"wars of liberation\". In Congo, in Sierra\r\nLeone, in Chechnyia, in Kashmir - wars are as much\r\nabout diamonds, oil and opium poppies as about national\r\naspirations. Kosovo is no exception but it was here that\r\nthe West was duped into intervention. NATO was called\r\nupon to arbiter between two crime gangs. There is no end\r\nto the mischievous irony of history.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the following incidents are more telling than any\r\nlearned analysis:\r\nIn late April, the Albanian telecom switched off the\r\nroaming facility of cell phones in Albania. Foreigners -\r\nincluding aid workers - had to pay the company 1000\r\ndollars for a special roaming-enabled chip.\r\n\r\nRumour has it that the post of the Chief of Police in the\r\nTirana Airport was \"sold\" at the beginning of April for an\r\nundisclosed amount (presumably 250,000 US dollars).\r\n\r\nThe reasons: all shippers (including NATO and aid\r\norganizations) have to pay enormous kickbacks to airport\r\nand customs officials to release their goods.\r\n\r\nMost Albanian families charged refugee families an\r\naverage of 500 DM a month for their accommodation in\r\nsubhuman conditions. Refugees who could not pay (or\r\nwho had no relatives in Germany and Switzerland to pay\r\nfor them) were evicted, often cruelly.\r\n\r\nAs Serbs were murdering their supposed brothers in\r\nKosovo, Albanian crime gangs laid an oil pipeline\r\n(through Lake Shkoder) to Serbia and supplied the Serb\r\narmy with the oil it was deprived of by NATO.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Balkans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI.  Milosevic's Treasure Island\r\n\r\n\r\nMilosevic and his cronies stand accused of plundering\r\nSerbia's wealth - both pecuniary and natural. Yet, the\r\nmedia tends to confuse three modes of action with two\r\ndiametrically opposed goals. There was state sanctioned\r\ncapital flight. Gold and foreign exchange were smuggled\r\nout of Yugoslavia and deposited in other countries. This\r\nwas meant to provide a cushion against embargo and\r\nsanctions imposed on Yugoslavia by the West.\r\n\r\nThe scale of these operations has been wildly over-\r\nestimated at 4 billion US dollars. A figure half as big is\r\nmore reasonable. Most of the money was used\r\nlegitimately, to finance the purchase of food, medicines,\r\nand energy products. Yugoslavia would have frozen to\r\ndeath had its leaders not have the foresight to act as they\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nThis had nothing to do with party officials, cronies, and\r\ntheir family members enriching themselves by \"diverting\"\r\nexport proceeds and commodities into private accounts in\r\nforeign lands. The culprits often disguised these acts of\r\nplunder as sanctions-busting operations. Hence the\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nThirdly, members of the establishment and their relatives\r\nwere allowed to run lucrative smuggling and black market\r\noperations fuelled by cheap credits coerced out of the\r\ndilapidated and politicised \"banking\" system.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1987, a network of off-shore bank accounts\r\nand holding companies was established by Serbia's\r\nCommunist party and, later, by Yugoslavia. This frantic\r\ngroping for alternatives reached a peak during 1989 and\r\n1991 and after 1992 when accounts were opened in\r\nCyprus, Israel, Greece, and Switzerland and virtually all\r\nmajor Yugoslav firms opened Cypriot subsidiaries or\r\nholding structures. Starting in 1991, the Central Bank's\r\ngold (and a small part of the foreign exchange reserves)\r\nwere deposited in Switzerland (mainly in Zurich). A\r\ncompany by the name of \"Metalurski Kombinat\r\nSmederevo - MKS\" (renamed \"Sartid\" after its bogus\r\nprivatisation) was instrumental in this through its MKS\r\nZurich subsidiary. MKS was a giant complex of metal\r\nprocessing factories, headed by a former Minister of\r\nIndustry and a Milosevic loyalist, Dusko Matkovic. The\r\nlatter also served as deputy chairman of Milosevic's party.\r\n\r\nThe lines between party, state and personal fortunes\r\nblurred fast. Small banking institutions were established\r\neverywhere, even in London (the AY Bank) and\r\nconducted operations throughout the world. They were\r\nowned by bogus shareholders, out of the reach of the\r\ninternational sanctions regime.\r\n\r\nWhen UN sanctions were imposed in stages (1992-5), the\r\nstate made sure its export proceeds were out of harm's\r\nway and never in sanctions-bound UK and USA banks.\r\n\r\nThe main financial agent was \"Beogradska Banka\" and its\r\nbranch in Novi Sad. In a series of complex transactions\r\ninvolving foreign exchange trades, smuggled privatisation\r\nproceeds, and inflated import invoices, it was able to stash\r\naway hundreds of millions of dollars. This money was\r\nused to finance imports and defray the exorbitant\r\ncommissions, fees, and costs charged by numerous\r\nintermediaries. Yugoslavia (and the regime) had no choice\r\n- it was either that or starvation, freezing and explosive\r\nsocial discontent.\r\n\r\nConcurrently, a massive and deeply criminalized web of\r\nsmuggling, illegal (customs-exempt) imports, bribe and\r\ncorruption has stifled all legal manufacturing and\r\ncommerce activities. Cigarettes through Montenegro,\r\nalcohol and oil through Romania, petrol, other goods\r\n(finished and semi-finished) and raw materials from\r\nGreece through the Vardar river (Macedonia), absolutely\r\neverything through Croatia, drugs from Turkey (and\r\nAfghanistan). UN personnel happily colluded and\r\ncollaborated - for a fee, of course. The export of\r\ncommodities - such as grain or precious metals (gold,\r\neven Uranium) - was granted in monopoly to Milosevic\r\nstalwarts. These were vast fiefdoms controlled by a few\r\nprominent \"families\" and Milosevic favourites. It was also\r\nimmensely lucrative. Even minor figures were able to\r\ndeposit millions of US dollars in their Russian, Cypriot,\r\nLebanese, Greek, Austrian, Swiss, and South African\r\naccounts. The regime leaned heavily on Yugoslav banks\r\nto finance these new rich with cheap, soft, and often non-\r\nreturnable, credits. These were often used to speculate in\r\nthe frenetic informal foreign exchange markets for\r\nimmediate windfalls.\r\n\r\nThe new Yugoslav authorities are likely to be deeply\r\nfrustrated and disappointed. Most of the money was\r\nexpended on essentials for the population. The personal\r\nfortunes made are tiny by comparison and well-shielded\r\nin off-shore banking havens. Milosevic himself has almost\r\nnothing to his name. His son and daughter may constitute\r\nricher pickings but not by much. The hunt for the\r\nMilosevic treasure is bound to be an expensive, futile\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII.  Macedonia's Augean Stables,\r\n\r\nor: Don't Hurry to Invest in Macedonia\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the near past, Macedonia seemed to have been bent on\r\nbreaking its own record of surrealism. While politicians in\r\nother countries in transition from communism and\r\nsocialism strive to be noticed for not stealing, their\r\nMacedonian counterparts, without a single exception, aim\r\nto steal without being noticed.\r\n\r\nThe previous VMRO-DPMNE government (1999-2002),\r\nin which Nikola Gruevski, the current Prime Minister,\r\nserved as Minister of Finance, plundered the country\r\nshamelessly. The local papers accused then outgoing\r\nprime minister, Ljubco Georgievski - a virtual pauper\r\nwhen he attained power - of owning land and a residential\r\nbuilding in the capital's most expensive neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe erstwhile Minister of Defense, Ljuben Paunovski,\r\nwas recently sentenced to 42 months in prison for his\r\npecuniary shenanigans during his tenure. Another leading\r\nfigure, the former Minister of interior, Ljube Boskovski, is\r\nin the dock in the Hague on war crime charges.\r\n\r\nInevitably, VMRO-DPMNE lost power to the SDSM in\r\nthe heated elections of 2002 and then fractured as its new\r\nleader, Gruevski, purged the old guard and installed his\r\nown cohorts everywhere.\r\n\r\nThen prime minister designate, Branko Crvnkovski (the\r\ncountry's current President whose legitimacy is contested\r\nby the Gruevski government), vowed to learn from his\r\nparty's (SDSM) past mistakes when they venally ruled the\r\nland until 1998. In a sudden and politically-motivated\r\nresurrection, the high court began scrutinizing the \"Okta\"\r\ndeal: the opaque sale of the country's loss-making refinery\r\nto the Greeks in 1999. Heads will roll, promised both the\r\nelection victors (the SDSM) and their Western sponsors.\r\n\r\nNothing happened.\r\n\r\nThe country's current Governor of the Central bank and\r\nthen minister of finance, Petar Goshev, a former socialist\r\nhigh-level functionary known for his integrity, announced\r\nthat his top priority would be to eradicate corruption by\r\ninstituting structural and legal reforms. His newfound\r\nsocialist partners - he headed a center-right outfit - found\r\nthis bizarre ardor unpalatable and promptly kicked him\r\nout of office.\r\n\r\nFour years later, with Georgievski relegated to the\r\npolitical wasteland, Crvnkovski ensconced in the\r\npresidential suite, and his successor, Buckovski a\r\nresounding failure, Gruevski's ascent in 2006 was all but\r\nsecure. It was the SDSM's turn to crumble acrimoniously\r\namid a virulent contest for its leadership. It has never\r\nrecovered and Macedonia has had no viable opposition\r\never since.\r\n\r\nMacedonia's post-electoral euphoria faded, in July 2006,\r\ninto arduous coalition-building negotiations replete with\r\narm-twisting by the worried representatives of the\r\n\"international community\".\r\n\r\nThe country's new VMRO-DPMNE Prime Minister,\r\nNikola Gruevski (36), excluded from his government the\r\nparty that won the majority of Albanian votes because of\r\nits roots in the much-hated Albanian NLA, National\r\nLiberation Army, the instigator of the 2001 near-civil-war.\r\n\r\nAlbanian factions clashed in a chilling reminder of the\r\ncountry's inter-ethnic fragility.\r\n\r\nTo add to Macedonia's precarious standing, its greenhorn\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, Antonio Milososki, engaged\r\nin intermittent - and utterly avoidable - spats with its\r\nneighbor and biggest foreign investor, Greece, virtually\r\nguarantee delayed accession to both NATO and the\r\nEuropean Union, the much ballyhooed strategic goals of\r\nthe current administration. Milososki adopted a similarly\r\nbelligerent and ill-informed stance against Bulgaria,\r\nanother flanking polity and the newest member of the\r\ncoveted European club.\r\n\r\nWhere the government claims great strides is in its\r\nuncompromising stance against all forms of malfeasance\r\nand delinquency in both the public and the private sectors.\r\n\r\nFrom the army to various municipalities, scandals erupt\r\ndaily in an atmosphere often bordering on a frenzied,\r\nmedia saturated, witch-hunt.\r\n\r\nGruevski is alleged to have rejected a bribe of 3 million\r\neuros (c. 4 million USD) offered to him by a Serb firm.\r\n\r\nHis government embarked on highly publicized\r\ncampaigns against illegal construction (the \"urban mafia\")\r\nand other festering nests of corruption.\r\n\r\nAlas, Gruevski himself appointed members of his family\r\nand innumerable political hacks to senior government\r\npositions in a series of blatant acts of nepotism and\r\ncronyism decried by the European Union and other\r\nwatchdogs. Consequently, with one exception (Zoran\r\nStavreski, the talented vice-premier), the government in\r\nall echelons is largely made up of utterly inexperienced\r\noperators. Plus ca change.\r\n\r\nPolitics, venality, and terrorism are the sole venues of\r\nsocial mobility in this tiny, landlocked, country of 2\r\nmillion impoverished people. Immediately following their\r\ninsurgency, the former terrorists of the Albanian National\r\nLiberation - courtesy of Western pressure and the\r\nAlbanian voters - occupied crucial ministries with\r\nlucrative opportunities of patronage of which they are\r\nrumored to have availed themselves abundantly.\r\n\r\nComic relief is often provided by bumbling NGOs, such\r\nas the International Crisis Group. In 2001, its\r\nrepresentative in Macedonia, Edward Joseph, went to\r\nPrilep to conduct an impromptu investigation of the\r\nthriving cigarette smuggling trade. Posing to the cameras\r\nhe declared that only the local leaf-rolling plant was not\r\ninvolved in this pernicious line of work.\r\n\r\nMacedonia is a hub of expats and consultants in the\r\nBalkans. Ante Markovic, an Austria-based former\r\nYugoslav prime minister, who served as an oft-criticized\r\neconomic advisor to the government until he was dumped,\r\nsued Macedonia for $1 million. In 2001-3, the youthful\r\nformer minister of finance, Nikola Gruevski, was asked\r\nby USAID, on behalf of the Serbian-Montenegrin\r\ngovernment, to serve as its consultant on matters of\r\nreform of the financial system. The author of this article\r\nacted as Economic Advisor to Georgievski's government\r\nand, later, to Gruevski himself.\r\n\r\nBut to no avail. The country is a shambles. In the wake of\r\na civil war, the official unemployment rate is 31-35\r\npercent. Close to 70,000 people work in the bloated\r\ncentral and local administrations. The trade deficit is an\r\nunparalleled 17 percent of GDP. In 2001, the budget\r\ndeficit climbed to 5 percent, though it was since halved.\r\n\"The Heritage Foundation\" has consistently ranked\r\nMacedonia 95-97 out of 155 countries in terms of\r\neconomic freedom. The country is \"mostly unfree\" it\r\ncorrectly concludes in its reports, though it cites\r\nsometimes erroneous data. A moderate level of trade\r\nprotectionism, low tax rates, moderate inflation, a\r\nmoderate burden of the government, moderate barriers to\r\ncapital flows and foreign investment, and moderate\r\ninterference in the economy are offset by a dysfunctional\r\nbanking system, intervention in wages and prices, low\r\nlevel of protection of property, a high level of regulation,\r\nand a very high level of activity of the black market.\r\n\r\nOwing to the IMF's misguided emphasis on exchange rate\r\nstability, the currency is inanely overvalued. The\r\nmanufacturing sector has all but evaporated. Industrial\r\nproduction declined by a vertiginous 20 percent in August\r\n2002 compared to the average the year before - or by 11\r\npercent year on year. The trend has not been reversed\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nMacedonian steel is exempt from the latest bout of\r\nAmerican protectionism, but not so its textile industry.\r\n\r\nEurope is fending off the country's agricultural products.\r\n\r\nPeople make their meager and desultory living catering to\r\nthe needs of an ever-expanding international presence or\r\ndabbling in illicit activities. Piracy of intellectual property,\r\nfor instance, is thought to yield c. 1 percent of GDP.\r\n\r\nClose to half the population is under the poverty line. The\r\nnumber of welfare cases increased by 70 percent between\r\n1994 and 2002. Generous and incessant multilateral and\r\nbilateral credits sustain the faltering economy (and line\r\npoliticians' ever-deepening pockets). The country is\r\nalternately buffeted by floods and droughts. There has\r\nbeen only one day of rain in all of January 2007.\r\n\r\nIn a much-touted donor conference after the 2001\r\nskirmishes, the pledges amounted to a whopping 15\r\npercent of GDP. Then governor of the central bank, Ljube\r\nTrpski (currently detained for his role in a murky affair\r\ninvolving the country's foreign exchange reserves),\r\ncheerfully predicted that these handouts will cover the\r\ngaping hole in the balance of payments.\r\n\r\nMacedonia also received 7.5 percent of the gold reserves\r\nof the former federated Yugoslavia of which it was a\r\ncomponent. At between $700 million and one billion USD\r\nnet, foreign exchange reserves are at an all-time high.\r\n\r\nMacedonia has recently decided to prepay its $104 million\r\ndebt to the Paris Club creditors.\r\n\r\nBoth the IMF and the World Bank, who did their best to\r\nobstruct the previous VMRO-DPMNE government in its\r\nlast few months in power, promised a speedy return to\r\nbusiness as usual. An hitherto elusive standby\r\narrangement is likely to be concluded by the end of the\r\nyear. World Bank funds, frozen in material breach of its\r\nwritten contracts with the state, will flow again. The EU\r\npromised development funds if the new government acts\r\nin a \"European spirit\" - i.e., obeys the diktats of Brussels.\r\n\r\nThe incoming administration is likely to enjoy a period of\r\ngrace with both the trade unions and international\r\ncreditors. Strikes and demonstrations by dispossessed\r\nminers and underpaid railways workers have waned. But\r\nMacedonia joined the WTO in 2002 and will thus be\r\nforced to open even more to devastating competition.\r\n\r\nLabor unrest is likely to re-erupt soon.\r\n\r\nForeign investment in the country mysteriously wanes and\r\nwaxes - some of it laundered money reinvested in\r\nlegitimate businesses. The government is doing a great job\r\nof building up the image of Macedonia as an FDI (Foreign\r\nDirect Investment) destination. But public relations and\r\nperceptions management must be followed by palpable\r\nactions and the new government is woefully short on\r\nconcrete steps. It talks the talk but hitherto does not walk\r\nthe walk.\r\n\r\nThe government's attempts to attract foreign investors by\r\nintroducing lower taxes may backfire: studies clearly\r\nevince that multinationals worry less about taxation and\r\nmore about functioning institutions, a commodity that\r\nMacedonia is irreparably short of. Moreover, vanishingly\r\nlower taxes signal desperation and Macedonia indeed\r\nsounds more desperate than confident. No one wants to\r\nbuy the country's leading bank, long on offer. Only one\r\ncontender (Mobilkom Austria) entered a bid for\r\nMacedonia's third operator cellular network licence.\r\n\r\nOn a few occasions, domestic firms, using international\r\nfronts, have bid for local factories, such as the textile plant\r\n\"Astibo\". The national payment card project has been\r\nguzzled by two banks incestuously close to the outgoing\r\nruling party, VMRO-DPMNE.\r\n\r\nBut there are real investments, too. The capital's central\r\nheating utility was purchased by a unidentified French\r\nenergy outfit, announced the general manager. The\r\nutility's shares were listed in the Athens stock exchange.\r\n\r\nThe Macedonian construction firm \"Granit\" will build a\r\n$59 million highway in Ukraine, with which Macedonia\r\nenjoyed an unusually cordial relationship, to American\r\nchagrin. Johnson Controls and others are eying a string of\r\nfree trade zones and infrastructure projects (dams, roads,\r\nrailways, oil pipeline). A much hyped Vardar Silicone\r\nValley is in the works.\r\n\r\nThe contentious census in the first two weeks of\r\nNovember 2002, a part of the \"Ohrid Framework\r\nAgreement\" which ended the internecine fighting the year\r\nbefore, was conducted fairly. The count showed that\r\nAlbanians make c. one quarter of the population rather\r\nthan one third, as most Albanians spuriously insisted.\r\n\r\nBut, with Kosovo's independence looming across the\r\nborder, the restive Albanians are likely to coerce the\r\nenfeebled Macedonia into translating this numerical\r\nreality into political and economic clout. The\r\nMacedonians are likely to resist. The West will intervene.\r\n\r\nMacedonia is facing a hot spring and a sizzling summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII. The Macedonian Lottery\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery conflict has its economic moments and dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe current conflict in Macedonia perhaps even more so.\r\n\r\nThe USA and its Western allies regard Macedonia as a\r\nbridge between Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Albania.\r\n\r\nHence the EU's plans for the revival of transport corridors\r\n8 and 10 connecting these countries. If all goes well (and\r\nnothing has hitherto), railways will connect Bulgaria to\r\nMacedonia and river traffic will flow to Serbia from its\r\nsouthern neighbours. All this is envisioned in the Stability\r\nPact. There are talks of an oil pipeline across Macedonia's\r\nterritory. A pacified Macedonia is fairly crucial to Serbia's\r\nrecovery and to the prospects of the whole region to\r\nattract FDI.\r\n\r\nNATO is afraid of Turkish-Greek clashes in the aftermath\r\nof Kosovo and Macedonia. Turkey has increasingly cast\r\nitself in its ancient role of \"protector of the Balkan\r\nMuslims\". Greece is the only Orthodox-Christian member\r\nof the EU and an old foe of the erstwhile Sick Man of\r\nEurope from which it won bloody independence at the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century. Such clashes are likely to\r\ndestabilize the southern flank of NATO and block the\r\nWest's access to Iraq, the Middle East, oil-rich Central\r\nAsia, and northern China. This will seriously dent the new\r\n\"Pacific and Middle East Orientations\" of the Bush\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nAnd what about the actual combatants?\r\nAlbanians and Macedonian crime gangs (in cahoots with\r\nkleptocratic and venal local politicians) regard Macedonia\r\nas a vital route for drugs, stolen cars, smuggled cigarettes\r\nand soft drinks, illegal immigrants, white slavery, and\r\nweapons dealing. These criminal activities far outweigh\r\nthe GDP of all the adversary states combined. This\r\nconflict is about controlling territory and the economic\r\nbenefits attendant to such control.\r\n\r\nCrime and war provide employment, status, regular\r\nincome, perks, and livelihood to many denizens of\r\nMacedonia, Albania, and Bulgaria. They constitute an\r\noutlet for entrepreneurship, however perverted. Fighting\r\nfor the cause and smuggling often means travel abroad\r\n(for instance, on fund raising missions), five star\r\naccommodation, and a lavish lifestyle. It also translates\r\ninto powers of patronage and excesses of self-enrichment.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in ossified, socially stratified, ethnically\r\npolarized, and economically impoverished societies, war\r\nand crime engender social mobility. The likes of Hashim\r\nThaci, Ramush Harajdini, and Ali Ahmeti often start as\r\nrebels and end as part of the cosseted establishment. Many\r\na criminal dabble in politics and business.\r\n\r\nHence the tenacity of both phenomena. Hence the bleak\r\nand pessimistic outlook for this region. The \"formal\"\r\neconomies simply cannot compete. Jobs are not created,\r\nthe educated are often bitterly idle, salaries are minuscule\r\nif paid at all, the future is past. Crime and politics (one\r\nand the same in the Balkan) are alluring alternatives.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the NLA and its political successor DUI is not\r\na monolithic entity. It is more like an umbrella\r\norganization with serious and fracturing differences of\r\nopinion regarding the ultimate goals of the insurrection\r\nfour years ago (2001) and the means to obtain these goals.\r\n\r\nRoughly, NLA was made up of one third veteran Kosovo\r\nfighters, some of them professional soldiers, who also\r\nfought in Croatia, or in the Foreign Legion. These people\r\nare bitter and disgruntled by what they see as the betrayal\r\nof the West in refusing to guarantee an independent\r\nKosovo and the failure of the current Kosovar leadership\r\nto integrate them economically into the emerging polity\r\nthere. Their motives for joining the fighting in Macedonia\r\nwere part emotional and part pecuniary.\r\n\r\nAnother third was made of unemployed, young Albanians,\r\nmainly from Macedonia itself. Their fighting is self-\r\ninterested. They get a monthly salary and perks and,\r\nlacking education and skills, they don't have much of a\r\nchoice outside the killing fields.\r\n\r\nThe rest are diehard, hardcore, idealists who either\r\nfervently espouse a Great Albania, or would like to take\r\nover Western Macedonian in a \"constitutional coup\"\r\nwhich will grant them their own police force,\r\nmunicipalities, institutions, universities, budgets, and\r\nsemi-political structures.\r\n\r\nThe NLA itself was not directly involved in criminal\r\nactivities, though a few of its members are. But the money\r\nthat financed it (from the Czech Republic, Switzerland,\r\nGermany, and the USA) is tainted by drug dealing, white\r\nslavery, illegal immigration, and the smuggling of\r\neverything illicit, from cigarettes to stolen cars, to\r\nweapons. In this they collaborate with politicians and\r\ncriminals in Macedonia - both Albanian and Macedonian.\r\n\r\nBeing a politician in the Balkan is an extremely lucrative\r\nproposition. Both Albanian and Macedonian politicians\r\nwill abandon the peace process if they believe it leads to\r\nelectoral ruin. Given the current atmosphere, it pays to be\r\na pacifist. Virulent nationalism is a guaranteed vote\r\nloser. But every re-election ticket still requires a modicum\r\nof xenophobia, ethnic exclusivity, and radicalism. Here\r\nlies the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV.  Crime Fighting Computer Systems and Databases\r\n\r\nAs crime globalizes, so does crime fighting. Mobsters,\r\nserial killers, and terrorists cross state lines and borders\r\neffortlessly, making use of the latest advances in mass\r\nmedia, public transportation, telecommunications, and\r\ncomputer networks. The police - there are 16,000 law\r\nenforcement agencies in the Unites States alone - is never\r\nvery far behind.\r\n\r\nQuotes from the official Web pages of some of these\r\ndatabases:\r\nNational Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime\r\n(NCAVC)\r\nIts mission is to combine investigative and operational\r\nsupport functions, research, and training in order to\r\nprovide assistance, without charge, to federal, state, local,\r\nand foreign law enforcement agencies investigating\r\nunusual or repetitive violent crimes. The NCAVC also\r\nprovides support through expertise and consultation in\r\nnon-violent matters such as national security, corruption,\r\nand white-collar crime investigations.\r\n\r\nIt comprises the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU), Child\r\nAbduction and Serial Murder Investigative Resources\r\nCenter (CASMIRC), and Violent Criminal\r\nApprehension Program (VICAP).\r\n\r\nVICAP is a nationwide data information center designed\r\nto collect, collate, and analyze crimes of violence -\r\nspecifically murder. It collates and analyzes the\r\nsignificant characteristics of all murders, and other violent\r\noffenses.\r\n\r\nHomicide Investigation Tracking System (HITS)\r\nA program within the Washington state's Attorney\r\nGeneral's Office that tracks and investigates homicides\r\nand rapes.\r\n\r\nViolent Crime Linkage System (ViCLAS)\r\nCanada-wide computer system that assists specially\r\ntrained investigators to identify serial crimes and\r\ncriminals by focusing on the linkages that exist among\r\ncrimes by the same offender. This system was developed\r\nby the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) in the\r\nearly 1990s.\r\n\r\nUTAP, stands for The Utah Criminal Tracking and\r\nAnalysis Project\r\nGathers experts from forensic science, crime scene\r\nanalysis, psychiatry and other fields to screen unsolved\r\ncases for local law enforcement agencies.\r\n\r\nInternational Criminal Police Organization (ICPO) -\r\nInterpol's DNA Gateway\r\nProvides for the transfer of profile data between two or\r\nmore countries and for the comparison of profiles that\r\nconform to Interpol standards in a centralized database.\r\n\r\nInvestigators can access the database via their Interpol\r\nNational Central Bureau (NCB) using Interpol's secure\r\nglobal police communications system, I-24/7.\r\n\r\nInterpol's I-24/7\r\nGlobal communication system to connect its member\r\ncountries and provide them with user-friendly access to\r\npolice information. Using this system, Interpol National\r\nCentral Bureaus (NCBs) can search and cross-check data\r\nin a matter of seconds, with direct and immediate access\r\nto databases containing critical information (ASF\r\nNominal database of international criminals, electronic\r\nnotices, stolen motor vehicles, stolen/lost/counterfeit\r\ntravel and ID documents, stolen works of art, payment\r\ncards, fingerprints and photographs, a terrorism watch list,\r\na DNA database, disaster victim identification,\r\ninternational weapons tracking and trafficking in human\r\nbeings-related information, etc).\r\n\r\nInterpol Fingerprints\r\nProvides information on the development and\r\nimplementation of fingerprinting systems for the general\r\npublic and international law enforcement entities.\r\n\r\nEuropol (European Union's criminal intelligence\r\nagency) Computer System (TECS)\r\nMember States can directly input data into the information\r\nsystem in compliance with their national procedures, and\r\nEuropol can directly input data supplied by non EU\r\nMember States and third bodies.

The economics, the politics, the geopolitics, the\r\nconspiracies, the corruption, the old and the new, the plough and the internet - it is all\r\nhere, in colourful and provocative prose.\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Mind of Darkness\":\r\n\"'The Balkans' - I say - 'is the unconscious of the world'. People stop to digest this\r\nmetaphor and then they nod enthusiastically. It is here that the repressed memories of\r\nhistory, its traumas and fears and images reside. It is here that the psychodynamics of\r\nhumanity - the tectonic clash between Rome and Byzantium, West and East, Judeo-\r\nChristianity and Islam - is still easily discernible. We are seated at a New Year's dining\r\ntable, loaded with a roasted pig and exotic salads. I, the Jew, only half foreign to this\r\ncradle of Slavonics. Four Serbs, five Macedonians. It is in the Balkans that all ethnic\r\ndistinctions fail and it is here that they prevail anachronistically and atavistically.\r\n\r\nContradiction and change the only two fixtures of this tormented region. The women of\r\nthe Balkan - buried under provocative mask-like make up, retro hairstyles and too\r\nnarrow dresses. The men, clad in sepia colours, old fashioned suits and turn of the\r\ncentury moustaches. In the background there is the crying game that is Balkanian\r\nmusic: liturgy and folk and elegy combined. The smells are heavy with muskular\r\nperfumes. It is like time travel. It is like revisiting one's childhood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV.
