RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME II\r\n\r\n\r\n1897\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrefatory Note\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first volume of this compilation was given to Congress and the\r\npublic about May 1, 1896. I believe I am warranted in saying here that\r\nit met with much favor by all who examined it. The press of the country\r\nwas unsparing in its praise. Congress, by a resolution passed on the 22d\r\nday of May, ordered the printing of 15,000 additional copies, of the\r\nentire publication.\r\n\r\nI have inserted in this volume a steel engraving of the Treasury\r\nbuilding; the succeeding volumes will contain engravings of other\r\nimportant public buildings.\r\n\r\nThe resolution authorizing this work required the publication of\r\nthe annual, special, and veto messages, inaugural addresses, and\r\nproclamations of the Presidents. I have found in addition to these\r\ndocuments others which emanated from the Chief Magistrats, called\r\nExecutive orders; they are in the nature of proclamations, and have like\r\nforce and effect. I have therefore included in this, and will include\r\nin the succeeding volumes, all such Executive orders as may appear to\r\nhave national importance or to possess more than ordinary interest.\r\n\r\nIf this volume meets the same degree of favor as the first, I shall be\r\ngreatly gratified.\r\n\r\nJAMES D. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\nJULY 4, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Monroe\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1817, to March 4, 1825\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Monroe\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Monroe was born April 28, 1758, in Westmoreland County, Va. He was\r\nthe son of Spence Monroe and Elizabeth Jones, both natives of Virginia.\r\nWhen in his eighteenth year he enlisted as a private soldier in the\r\nArmy to fight for independence; was in several battles, and was wounded\r\nin the engagement at Trenton; was promoted to the rank of captain of\r\ninfantry. During 1777 and 1778 he acted as aid to Lord Stirling, and\r\ndistinguished himself. He studied law under the direction of Thomas\r\nJefferson, then governor of Virginia, who in 1780 appointed him to visit\r\nthe army in South Carolina on an important mission. In 1782 he was\r\nelected to the Virginia assembly by the county of King George, and was\r\nby that body chosen a member of the executive council. The next year\r\nhe was chosen a delegate to the Continental Congress, and remained a\r\nmember until 1786; while a member he married a Miss Kortright, of New\r\nYork City. Retiring from Congress, he began the practice of law at\r\nFredericksburg, Va., but was at once elected to the legislature. In 1788\r\nwas a delegate to the State convention assembled to consider the Federal\r\nConstitution. Was a Senator from Virginia from 1790 to 1794. In May,\r\n1794, was appointed by Washington minister to France. He was recalled\r\nin 1796 and was again elected to the legislature. In 1799 was elected\r\ngovernor of Virginia. In 1802 was appointed by President Jefferson envoy\r\nextraordinary to France, and in 1803 was sent to London as the successor\r\nof Rufus King. In 1805 performed a diplomatic mission to Spain in\r\nrelation to the boundary of Louisiana, returning to London the following\r\nyear; returned to the United States in 1808. In 1811 was again elected\r\ngovernor of his State, but in the same year resigned that office to\r\nbecome Secretary of State under President Madison. After the capture\r\nof Washington, in 1814, he was appointed to the War Department, which\r\nposition he held until 1815, without relinquishing the office of\r\nSecretary of State. He remained at the head of the Department of State\r\nuntil the close of Mr. Madison's term. Was elected President in 1816,\r\nand reelected in 1820, retiring March 4, 1825, to his residence in\r\nLoudoun County, Va. In 1829 was elected a member of the convention\r\ncalled to revise the constitution of the State, and was unanimously\r\nchosen to preside over its deliberations. He was forced by ill health\r\nto retire from office, and removed to New York to reside with his\r\nson-in-law, Mr. Samuel L. Gouverneur. He died July 4, 1831, and was\r\nburied in New York City, but in 1858 his remains were removed to\r\nRichmond, Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT ELECT.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Senate communicated the following letter from the\r\nPresident elect of the United States:\r\n\r\nCITY OF WASHINGTON, _March 1, 1817_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN GAILLARD.\r\n\r\n_President of the Senate of the United States_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I beg leave through you to inform the honorable Senate of the\r\nUnited States that I propose to take the oath which the Constitution\r\nprescribes to the President of the United States before he enters on\r\nthe execution of his office on Tuesday, the 4th instant, at 12 o'clock,\r\nin the Chamber of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant,\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI should be destitute of feeling if I was not deeply affected by the\r\nstrong proof which my fellow-citizens have given me of their confidence\r\nin calling me to the high office whose functions I am about to assume.\r\nAs the expression of their good opinion of my conduct in the public\r\nservice, I derive from it a gratification which those who are conscious\r\nof having done all that they could to merit it can alone feel. My\r\nsensibility is increased by a just estimate of the importance of the\r\ntrust and of the nature and extent of its duties, with the proper\r\ndischarge of which the highest interests of a great and free people\r\nare intimately connected. Conscious of my own deficiency, I can not\r\nenter on these duties without great anxiety for the result. From a just\r\nresponsibility I will never shrink, calculating with confidence that in\r\nmy best efforts to promote the public welfare my motives will always\r\nbe duly appreciated and my conduct be viewed with that candor and\r\nindulgence which I have experienced in other stations.\r\n\r\nIn commencing the duties of the chief executive office it has been the\r\npractice of the distinguished men who have gone before me to explain the\r\nprinciples which would govern them in their respective Administrations.\r\nIn following their venerated example my attention is naturally drawn to\r\nthe great causes which have contributed in a principal degree to produce\r\nthe present happy condition of the United States. They will best explain\r\nthe nature of our duties and shed much light on the policy which ought\r\nto be pursued in future.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of our Revolution to the present day almost forty\r\nyears have elapsed, and from the establishment of this Constitution\r\ntwenty-eight. Through this whole term the Government has been what may\r\nemphatically be called self-government. And what has been the effect? To\r\nwhatever object we turn our attention, whether it relates to our foreign\r\nor domestic concerns, we find abundant cause to felicitate ourselves\r\nin the excellence of our institutions. During a period fraught with\r\ndifficulties and marked by very extraordinary events the United States\r\nhave nourished beyond example. Their citizens individually have been\r\nhappy and the nation prosperous.\r\n\r\nUnder this Constitution our commerce has been wisely regulated with\r\nforeign nations and between the States; new States have been admitted\r\ninto our Union; our territory has been enlarged by fair and honorable\r\ntreaty, and with great advantage to the original States; the States,\r\nrespectively protected by the National Government under a mild, parental\r\nsystem against foreign dangers, and enjoying within their separate\r\nspheres, by a wise partition of power, a just proportion of the\r\nsovereignty, have improved their police, extended their settlements, and\r\nattained a strength and maturity which are the best proofs of wholesome\r\nlaws well administered. And if we look to the condition of individuals\r\nwhat a proud spectacle does it exhibit! On whom has oppression fallen in\r\nany quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person\r\nor property? Who restrained from offering his vows in the mode which he\r\nprefers to the Divine Author of his being? It is well known that all\r\nthese blessings have been enjoyed in their fullest extent; and I add\r\nwith peculiar satisfaction that there has been no example of a capital\r\npunishment being inflicted on anyone for the crime of high treason.\r\n\r\nSome who might admit the competency of our Government to these\r\nbeneficent duties might doubt it in trials which put to the test its\r\nstrength and efficiency as a member of the great community of nations.\r\nHere too experience has afforded us the most satisfactory proof in its\r\nfavor. Just as this Constitution was put into action several of the\r\nprincipal States of Europe had become much agitated and some of them\r\nseriously convulsed. Destructive wars ensued, which have of late only\r\nbeen terminated. In the course of these conflicts the United States\r\nreceived great injury from several of the parties. It was their interest\r\nto stand aloof from the contest, to demand justice from the party\r\ncommitting the injury, and to cultivate by a fair and honorable conduct\r\nthe friendship of all. War became at length inevitable, and the result\r\nhas shown that our Government is equal to that, the greatest of trials,\r\nunder the most unfavorable circumstances. Of the virtue of the people\r\nand of the heroic exploits of the Army, the Navy, and the militia I need\r\nnot speak.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the happy Government under which we live--a Government\r\nadequate to every purpose for which the social compact is formed, a\r\nGovernment elective in all its branches, under which every citizen may\r\nby his merit obtain the highest trust recognized by the Constitution;\r\nwhich contains within it no cause of discord, none to put at variance\r\none portion of the community with another; a Government which protects\r\nevery citizen in the full enjoyment of his rights, and is able to\r\nprotect the nation against injustice from foreign powers.\r\n\r\nOther considerations of the highest importance admonish us to cherish\r\nour Union and to cling to the Government which supports it. Fortunate as\r\nwe are in our political institutions, we have not been less so in other\r\ncircumstances on which our prosperity and happiness essentially depend.\r\nSituated within the temperate zone, and extending through many degrees\r\nof latitude along the Atlantic, the United States enjoy all the\r\nvarieties of climate, and every production incident to that portion\r\nof the globe. Penetrating internally to the Great Lakes and beyond\r\nthe sources of the great rivers which communicate through our whole\r\ninterior, no country was ever happier with respect to its domain.\r\nBlessed, too, with a fertile soil, our produce has always been very\r\nabundant, leaving, even in years the least favorable, a surplus for\r\nthe wants of our fellow-men in other countries. Such is our peculiar\r\nfelicity that there is not a part of our Union that is not particularly\r\ninterested in preserving it. The great agricultural interest of the\r\nnation prospers under its protection. Local interests are not less\r\nfostered by it. Our fellow-citizens of the North engaged in navigation\r\nfind great encouragement in being made the favored carriers of the vast\r\nproductions of the other portions of the United States, while the\r\ninhabitants of these are amply recompensed, in their turn, by the\r\nnursery for seamen and naval force thus formed and reared up for\r\nthe support of our common rights. Our manufactures find a generous\r\nencouragement by the policy which patronizes domestic industry, and the\r\nsurplus of our produce a steady and profitable market by local wants in\r\nless-favored parts at home.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, being the highly favored condition of our country, it is the\r\ninterest of every citizen to maintain it. What are the dangers which\r\nmenace us? If any exist they ought to be ascertained and guarded\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\nIn explaining my sentiments on this subject it may be asked, What raised\r\nus to the present happy state? How did we accomplish the Revolution? How\r\nremedy the defects of the first instrument of our Union, by infusing\r\ninto the National Government sufficient power for national purposes,\r\nwithout impairing the just rights of the States or affecting those of\r\nindividuals? How sustain and pass with glory through the late war?\r\nThe Government has been in the hands of the people. To the people,\r\ntherefore, and to the faithful and able depositaries of their trust is\r\nthe credit due. Had the people of the United States been educated in\r\ndifferent principles, had they been less intelligent, less independent,\r\nor less virtuous, can it be believed that we should have maintained the\r\nsame steady and consistent career or been blessed with the same success?\r\nWhile, then, the constituent body retains its present sound and\r\nhealthful state everything will be safe. They will choose competent\r\nand faithful representatives for every department. It is only when\r\nthe people become ignorant and corrupt, when they degenerate into\r\na populace, that they are incapable of exercising the sovereignty.\r\nUsurpation is then an easy attainment, and an usurper soon found. The\r\npeople themselves become the willing instruments of their own debasement\r\nand ruin. Let us, then, look to the great cause, and endeavor to\r\npreserve it in full force. Let us by all wise and constitutional\r\nmeasures promote intelligence among the people as the best means of\r\npreserving our liberties.\r\n\r\nDangers from abroad are not less deserving of attention. Experiencing\r\nthe fortune of other nations, the United States may be again involved\r\nin war, and it may in that event be the object of the adverse party to\r\noverset our Government, to break our Union, and demolish us as a nation.\r\nOur distance from Europe and the just, moderate, and pacific policy of\r\nour Government may form some security against these dangers, but they\r\nought to be anticipated and guarded against. Many of our citizens are\r\nengaged in commerce and navigation, and all of them are in a certain\r\ndegree dependent on their prosperous state. Many are engaged in the\r\nfisheries. These interests are exposed to invasion in the wars between\r\nother powers, and we should disregard the faithful admonition of\r\nexperience if we did not expect it. We must support our rights or lose\r\nour character, and with it, perhaps, our liberties. A people who fail\r\nto do it can scarcely be said to hold a place among independent nations.\r\nNational honor is national property of the highest value. The sentiment\r\nin the mind of every citizen is national strength. It ought therefore\r\nto be cherished.\r\n\r\nTo secure us against these dangers our coast and inland frontiers should\r\nbe fortified, our Army and Navy, regulated upon just principles as to\r\nthe force of each, be kept in perfect order, and our militia be placed\r\non the best practicable footing. To put our extensive coast in such a\r\nstate of defense as to secure our cities and interior from invasion will\r\nbe attended with expense, but the work when finished will be permanent,\r\nand it is fair to presume that a single campaign of invasion by a naval\r\nforce superior to our own, aided by a few thousand land troops, would\r\nexpose us to greater expense, without taking into the estimate the loss\r\nof property and distress of our citizens, than would be sufficient for\r\nthis great work. Our land and naval forces should be moderate, but\r\nadequate to the necessary purposes--the former to garrison and preserve\r\nour fortifications and to meet the first invasions of a foreign foe,\r\nand, while constituting the elements of a greater force, to preserve the\r\nscience as well as all the necessary implements of war in a state to be\r\nbrought into activity in the event of war; the latter, retained within\r\nthe limits proper in a state of peace, might aid in maintaining the\r\nneutrality of the United States with dignity in the wars of other powers\r\nand in saving the property of their citizens from spoliation. In time\r\nof war, with the enlargement of which the great naval resources of the\r\ncountry render it susceptible, and which should be duly fostered in\r\ntime of peace, it would contribute essentially, both as an auxiliary\r\nof defense and as a powerful engine of annoyance, to diminish the\r\ncalamities of war and to bring the war to a speedy and honorable\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nBut it ought always to be held prominently in view that the safety of\r\nthese States and of everything dear to a free people must depend in an\r\neminent degree on the militia. Invasions may be made too formidable to\r\nbe resisted by any land and naval force which it would comport either\r\nwith the principles of our Government or the circumstances of the United\r\nStates to maintain. In such cases recourse must be had to the great body\r\nof the people, and in a manner to produce the best effect. It is of the\r\nhighest importance, therefore, that they be so organized and trained as\r\nto be prepared for any emergency. The arrangement should be such as to\r\nput at the command of the Government the ardent patriotism and youthful\r\nvigor of the country. If formed on equal and just principles, it can not\r\nbe oppressive. It is the crisis which makes the pressure, and not the\r\nlaws which provide a remedy for it. This arrangement should be formed,\r\ntoo, in time of peace, to be the better prepared for war. With such an\r\norganization of such a people the United States have nothing to dread\r\nfrom foreign invasion. At its approach an overwhelming force of gallant\r\nmen might always be put in motion.\r\n\r\nOther interests of high importance will claim attention, among which\r\nthe improvement of our country by roads and canals, proceeding always\r\nwith a constitutional sanction, holds a distinguished place. By thus\r\nfacilitating the intercourse between the States we shall add much to\r\nthe convenience and comfort of our fellow-citizens, much to the ornament\r\nof the country, and, what is of greater importance, we shall shorten\r\ndistances, and, by making each part more accessible to and dependent\r\non the other, we shall bind the Union more closely together. Nature\r\nhas done so much for us by intersecting the country with so many great\r\nrivers, bays, and lakes, approaching from distant points so near to each\r\nother, that the inducement to complete the work seems to be peculiarly\r\nstrong. A more interesting spectacle was perhaps never seen than is\r\nexhibited within the limits of the United States--a territory so vast\r\nand advantageously situated, containing objects so grand, so useful,\r\nso happily connected in all their parts!\r\n\r\nOur manufactures will likewise require the systematic and fostering care\r\nof the Government. Possessing as we do all the raw materials, the fruit\r\nof our own soil and industry, we ought not to depend in the degree we\r\nhave done on supplies from other countries. While we are thus dependent\r\nthe sudden event of war, unsought and unexpected, can not fail to plunge\r\nus into the most serious difficulties, it is important, too, that the\r\ncapital which nourishes our manufactures should be domestic, as its\r\ninfluence in that case instead of exhausting, as it may do in foreign\r\nhands, would be felt advantageously on agriculture and every other\r\nbranch of industry. Equally important is it to provide at home a market\r\nfor our raw materials, as by extending the competition it will enhance\r\nthe price and protect the cultivator against the casualties incident to\r\nforeign markets.\r\n\r\nWith the Indian tribes it is our duty to cultivate friendly relations\r\nand to act with kindness and liberality in all our transactions. Equally\r\nproper is it to persevere in our efforts to extend to them the\r\nadvantages of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe great amount of our revenue and the flourishing state of the\r\nTreasury are a full proof of the competency of the national resources\r\nfor any emergency, as they are of the willingness of our fellow citizens\r\nto bear the burdens which the public necessities require. The vast\r\namount of vacant lands, the value of which daily augments, forms an\r\nadditional resource of great extent and duration. These resources,\r\nbesides accomplishing every other necessary purpose, put it completely\r\nin the power of the United States to discharge the national debt at an\r\nearly period. Peace is the best time for improvement and preparation of\r\nevery kind; it is in peace that our commerce flourishes most, that taxes\r\nare most easily paid, and that the revenue is most productive.\r\n\r\nThe Executive is charged officially in the Departments under it with\r\nthe disbursement of the public money, and is responsible for the\r\nfaithful application of it to the purposes for which it is raised. The\r\nLegislature is the watchful guardian over the public purse. It is its\r\nduty to see that the disbursement has been honestly made. To meet the\r\nrequisite responsibility every facility should be afforded to the\r\nExecutive to enable it to bring the public agents intrusted with the\r\npublic money strictly and promptly to account. Nothing should be\r\npresumed against them; but if, with the requisite facilities, the public\r\nmoney is suffered to lie long and uselessly in their hands, they\r\nwill not be the only defaulters, nor will the demoralizing effect be\r\nconfined to them. It will evince a relaxation and want of tone in the\r\nAdministration which will be felt by the whole community. I shall do all\r\nI can to secure economy and fidelity in this important branch of the\r\nAdministration, and I doubt not that the Legislature will perform its\r\nduty with equal zeal. A thorough examination should be regularly made,\r\nand I will promote it.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly gratifying to me to enter on the discharge of these\r\nduties at a time when the United States are blessed with peace. It is a\r\nstate most consistent with their prosperity and happiness. It will be my\r\nsincere desire to preserve it, so far as depends on the Executive, on\r\njust principles with all nations, claiming nothing unreasonable of any\r\nand rendering to each what is its due.\r\n\r\nEqually gratifying is it to witness the increased harmony of opinion\r\nwhich pervades our Union. Discord does not belong to our system.\r\nUnion is recommended as well by the free and benign principles of our\r\nGovernment, extending its blessings to every individual, as by the other\r\neminent advantages attending it. The American people have encountered\r\ntogether great dangers and sustained severe trials with success. They\r\nconstitute one great family with a common interest. Experience has\r\nenlightened us on some questions of essential importance to the country.\r\nThe progress has been slow, dictated by a just reflection and a faithful\r\nregard to every interest connected with it. To promote this harmony in\r\naccord with the principles of our republican Government and in a manner\r\nto give them the most complete effect, and to advance in all other\r\nrespects the best interests of our Union, will be the object of my\r\nconstant and zealous exertions.\r\n\r\nNever did a government commence under auspices so favorable, nor ever\r\nwas success so complete. If we look to the history of other nations,\r\nancient or modern, we find no example of a growth so rapid, so gigantic,\r\nof a people so prosperous and happy. In contemplating what we have still\r\nto perform, the heart of every citizen must expand with joy when he\r\nreflects how near our Government has approached to perfection; that in\r\nrespect to it we have no essential improvement to make; that the great\r\nobject is to preserve it in the essential principles and features which\r\ncharacterize it, and that that is to be done by preserving the virtue\r\nand enlightening the minds of the people; and as a security against\r\nforeign dangers to adopt such arrangements as are indispensable to the\r\nsupport of our independence, our rights and liberties. If we persevere\r\nin the career in which we have advanced so far and in the path already\r\ntraced, we can not fail, under the favor of a gracious Providence, to\r\nattain the high destiny which seems to await us.\r\n\r\nIn the Administrations of the illustrious men who have preceded me\r\nin this high station, with some of whom I have been connected by the\r\nclosest ties from early life, examples are presented which will always\r\nbe found highly instructive and useful to their successors. From these\r\nI shall endeavor to derive all the advantages which they may afford.\r\nOf my immediate predecessor, under whom so important a portion of this\r\ngreat and successful experiment has been made, I shall be pardoned for\r\nexpressing my earnest wishes that he may long enjoy in his retirement\r\nthe affections of a grateful country, the best reward of exalted talents\r\nand the most faithful and meritorious services. Relying on the aid to\r\nbe derived from the other departments of the Government, I enter on the\r\ntrust to which I have been called by the suffrages of my fellow citizens\r\nwith my fervent prayers to the Almighty that He will be graciously\r\npleased to continue to us that protection which He has already so\r\nconspicuously displayed in our favor.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1817.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Niles's Weekly Register, vol. 12, p. 176.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act entitled \"An act providing for the sale of the tract\r\nof land at the lower rapids of Sandusky River,\" passed on the 27th day\r\nof April, 1816, it was enacted that all the lands in the said tract,\r\nexcept the reservations made in the said act, should be offered for\r\nsale to the highest bidder at Wooster, in the State of Ohio, under the\r\ndirection of the register of the land office and the receiver of public\r\nmoneys at Wooster, and on such day or days as shall, by a public\r\nproclamation of the President of the United States, be designated for\r\nthat purpose; and\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act entitled \"An act providing for the sale of the tract\r\nof land at the British fort at the Miami of the Lake, at the foot of the\r\nrapids, and for other purposes,\" passed the 27th day of April, 1816, it\r\nwas enacted that all the land contained in the said tract, except the\r\nreservations and exceptions made in the said act, should be offered for\r\nsale to the highest bidder at Wooster, in the State of Ohio, under the\r\ndirection of the register of the land office and the receiver of public\r\nmoneys at Wooster, and on such day or days as shall, by a public\r\nproclamation of the President of the United States, be designated for\r\nthat purpose:\r\n\r\nWherefore I, James Monroe, President of the United States, in conformity\r\nwith the provisions of the acts before recited, do hereby declare and\r\nmake known that the lands authorized to be sold by the first mentioned\r\nact shall be offered for sale to the highest bidder at Wooster, in the\r\nState of Ohio, on the first Monday in July next, and continue open for\r\nseven days and no longer, and that the lands authorized to be sold by\r\nthe last-mentioned act shall be offered for sale to the highest bidder\r\nat the same place on the third Tuesday in July next, and continue open\r\nfor seven days and no longer.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand this 15th day of April, 1817.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  J. MEIGS,\r\n    _Commissioner of the General Land Office_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAt no period of our political existence had we so much cause to\r\nfelicitate ourselves at the prosperous and happy condition of our\r\ncountry. The abundant fruits of the earth have filled it with plenty. An\r\nextensive and profitable commerce has greatly augmented our revenue. The\r\npublic credit has attained an extraordinary elevation. Our preparations\r\nfor defense in case of future wars, from which, by the experience\r\nof all nations, we ought not to expect to be exempted, are advancing\r\nunder a well-digested system with all the dispatch which so important\r\na work will admit. Our free Government, founded on the interest and\r\naffections of the people, has gained and is daily gaining strength.\r\nLocal jealousies are rapidly yielding to more generous, enlarged, and\r\nenlightened views of national policy. For advantages so numerous and\r\nhighly important it is our duty to unite in grateful acknowledgments\r\nto that Omnipotent Being from whom they are derived, and in unceasing\r\nprayer that He will endow us with virtue and strength to maintain and\r\nhand them down in their utmost purity to our latest posterity.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that an arrangement which had\r\nbeen commenced by my predecessor with the British Government for the\r\nreduction of the naval force by Great Britain and the United States on\r\nthe Lakes has been concluded, by which it is provided that neither party\r\nshall keep in service on Lake Champlain more than one vessel, on Lake\r\nOntario more than one, and on Lake Erie and the upper lakes more than\r\ntwo, to be armed each with one cannon only, and that all the other armed\r\nvessels of both parties, of which an exact list is interchanged, shall\r\nbe dismantled. It is also agreed that the force retained shall be\r\nrestricted in its duty to the internal purposes of each party, and\r\nthat the arrangement shall remain in force until six months shall have\r\nexpired after notice given by one of the parties to the other of its\r\ndesire that it should terminate. By this arrangement useless expense\r\non both sides and, what is of still greater importance, the danger of\r\ncollision between armed vessels in those inland waters, which was great,\r\nis prevented.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction also to state that the commissioners under the\r\nfourth article of the treaty of Ghent, to whom it was referred to decide\r\nto which party the several islands in the bay of Passamaquoddy belonged\r\nunder the treaty of 1783, have agreed in a report, by which all the\r\nislands in the possession of each party before the late war have been\r\ndecreed to it. The commissioners acting under the other articles of the\r\ntreaty of Ghent for the settlement of boundaries have also been engaged\r\nin the discharge, of their respective duties, but have not yet completed\r\nthem. The difference which arose between the two Governments under that\r\ntreaty respecting the right of the United States to take and cure fish\r\non the coast of the British provinces north of our limits, which had\r\nbeen secured by the treaty of 1783, is still in negotiation. The\r\nproposition made by this Government to extend to the colonies of Great\r\nBritain the principle of the convention of London, by which the commerce\r\nbetween the ports of the United States and British ports in Europe had\r\nbeen placed on a footing of equality, has been declined by the British\r\nGovernment. This subject having been thus amicably discussed between\r\nthe two Governments, and it appearing that the British Government\r\nis unwilling to depart from its present regulations, it remains for\r\nCongress to decide whether they will make any other regulations in\r\nconsequence thereof for the protection and improvement of our\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation with Spain for spoliations on our commerce and the\r\nsettlement of boundaries remains essentially in the state it held by the\r\ncommunications that were made to Congress by my predecessor. It has been\r\nevidently the policy of the Spanish Government to keep the negotiation\r\nsuspended, and in this the United States have acquiesced, from an\r\namicable disposition toward Spain and in the expectation that her\r\nGovernment would, from a sense of justice, finally accede to such an\r\narrangement as would be equal between the parties. A disposition has\r\nbeen lately shown by the Spanish Government to move in the negotiation,\r\nwhich has been met by this Government, and should the conciliatory\r\nand friendly policy which has invariably guided our councils be\r\nreciprocated, a just and satisfactory arrangement maybe expected. It\r\nis proper, however, to remark that no proposition has yet been made\r\nfrom which such a result can be presumed.\r\n\r\nIt was anticipated at an early stage that the contest between Spain and\r\nthe colonies would become highly interesting to the United States. It\r\nwas natural that our citizens should sympathize in events which affected\r\ntheir neighbors. It seemed probable also that the prosecution of the\r\nconflict along our coast and in contiguous countries would occasionally\r\ninterrupt our commerce and otherwise affect the persons and property of\r\nour citizens. These anticipations have been realized. Such injuries have\r\nbeen received from persons acting under authority of both the parties,\r\nand for which redress has in most instances been withheld. Through every\r\nstage of the conflict the United States have maintained an impartial\r\nneutrality, giving aid to neither of the parties in men, money, ships,\r\nor munitions of war. They have regarded the contest not in the light\r\nof an ordinary insurrection or rebellion, but as a civil war between\r\nparties nearly equal, having as to neutral powers equal rights. Our\r\nports have been open to both, and every article the fruit of our soil\r\nor of the industry of our citizens which either was permitted to take\r\nhas been equally free to the other. Should the colonies establish their\r\nindependence, it is proper now to state that this Government neither\r\nseeks nor would accept from them any advantage in commerce or otherwise\r\nwhich will not be equally open to all other nations. The colonies will\r\nin that event become independent states, free from any obligation to or\r\nconnection with us which it may not then be their interest to form on\r\nthe basis of a fair reciprocity.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the present year an expedition was set on foot against\r\nEast Florida by persons claiming to act under the authority of some of\r\nthe colonies, who took possession of Amelia Island, at the mouth of\r\nthe St. Marys River, near the boundary of the State of Georgia. As\r\nthis Province lies eastward of the Mississippi, and is bounded by the\r\nUnited States and the ocean on every side, and has been a subject of\r\nnegotiation with the Government of Spain as an indemnity for losses by\r\nspoliation or in exchange for territory of equal value westward of the\r\nMississippi, a fact well known to the world, it excited surprise that\r\nany countenance should be given to this measure by any of the colonies.\r\nAs it would be difficult to reconcile it with the friendly relations\r\nexisting between the United States and the colonies, a doubt was\r\nentertained whether it had been authorized by them, or any of them.\r\nThis doubt has gained strength by the circumstances which have unfolded\r\nthemselves in the prosecution of the enterprise, which have marked it as\r\na mere private, unauthorized adventure. Projected and commenced with an\r\nincompetent force, reliance seems to have been placed on what might be\r\ndrawn, in defiance of our laws, from within our limits; and of late, as\r\ntheir resources have failed, it has assumed a more marked character of\r\nunfriendliness to us, the island being made a channel for the illicit\r\nintroduction of slaves from Africa into the United States, an asylum for\r\nfugitive slaves from the neighboring States, and a port for smuggling of\r\nevery kind.\r\n\r\nA similar establishment was made at an earlier period by persons of the\r\nsame description in the Gulf of Mexico at a place called Galvezton,\r\nwithin the limits of the United States, as we contend, under the cession\r\nof Louisiana. This enterprise has been marked in a more signal manner by\r\nall the objectionable circumstances which characterized the other, and\r\nmore particularly by the equipment of privateers which have annoyed our\r\ncommerce, and by smuggling. These establishments, if ever sanctioned\r\nby any authority whatever, which is not believed, have abused their\r\ntrust and forfeited all claim to consideration. A just regard for the\r\nrights and interests of the United States required that they should be\r\nsuppressed, and orders have been accordingly issued to that effect. The\r\nimperious considerations which produced this measure will be explained\r\nto the parties whom it may in any degree concern.\r\n\r\nTo obtain correct information on every subject in which the United\r\nStates are interested; to inspire just sentiments in all persons in\r\nauthority, on either side, of our friendly disposition so far as it may\r\ncomport with an impartial neutrality, and to secure proper respect to\r\nour commerce in every port and from every flag, it has been thought\r\nproper to send a ship of war with three distinguished citizens along the\r\nsouthern coast with instruction to touch at such ports as they may find\r\nmost expedient for these purposes. With the existing authorities, with\r\nthose in the possession of and exercising the sovereignty, must the\r\ncommunication be held; from them alone can redress for past injuries\r\ncommitted by persons acting under them be obtained; by them alone can\r\nthe commission of the like in future be prevented.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the other powers of Europe have experienced no\r\nessential change since the last session. In our intercourse with each\r\ndue attention continues to be paid to the protection of our commerce,\r\nand to every other object in which the United States are interested.\r\nA strong hope is entertained that, by adhering to the maxims of a just,\r\na candid, and friendly policy, we may long preserve amicable relations\r\nwith all the powers of Europe on conditions advantageous and honorable\r\nto our country.\r\n\r\nWith the Barbary States and the Indian tribes our pacific relations have\r\nbeen preserved.\r\n\r\nIn calling your attention to the internal concerns of our country the\r\nview which they exhibit is peculiarly gratifying. The payments which\r\nhave been made into the Treasury show the very productive state of the\r\npublic revenue. After satisfying the appropriations made by law for\r\nthe support of the civil Government and of the military and naval\r\nestablishments, embracing suitable provision for fortifications and for\r\nthe gradual increase of the Navy, paying the interest of the public\r\ndebt, and extinguishing more than eighteen millions of the principal,\r\nwithin the present year, it is estimated that a balance of more than\r\n$6,000,000 will remain in the Treasury on the 1st day of January\r\napplicable to the current service of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nThe payments into the Treasury during the year 1818 on account of\r\nimposts and tonnage, resulting principally from duties which have\r\naccrued in the present year, may be fairly estimated at $20,000,000;\r\nthe internal revenues at $2,500,000; the public lands at $1,500,000;\r\nbank dividends and incidental receipts at $500,000; making in the\r\nwhole $24,500,000.\r\n\r\nThe annual permanent expenditure for the support of the civil Government\r\nand of the Army and Navy, as now established by law, amounts to\r\n$11,800,000, and for the sinking fund to $10,000,000, making in the\r\nwhole $21,800,000, leaving an annual excess of revenue beyond the\r\nexpenditure of $2,700,000, exclusive of the balance estimated to be\r\nin the Treasury on the 1st day of January, 1818.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of the Treasury the whole of the Louisiana debt\r\nmaybe redeemed in the year 1819, after which, if the public debt\r\ncontinues as it now is, above par, there will be annually about five\r\nmillions of the sinking fund unexpended until the year 1825, when the\r\nloan of 1812 and the stock created by funding Treasury notes will be\r\nredeemable.\r\n\r\nIt is also estimated that the Mississippi stock will be discharged\r\nduring the year 1819 from the proceeds of the public lands assigned to\r\nthat object, after which the receipts from those lands will annually\r\nadd to the public revenue the sum of one million and a half, making the\r\npermanent annual revenue amount to $26,000,000, and leaving an annual\r\nexcess of revenue after the year 1819 beyond the permanent authorized\r\nexpenditure of more than $4,000,000.\r\n\r\nBy the last returns to the Department of War the militia force of the\r\nseveral States may be estimated at 800,000 men--infantry, artillery, and\r\ncavalry. Great part of this force is armed, and measures are taken to\r\narm the whole. An improvement in the organization and discipline of\r\nthe militia is one of the great objects which claims the unremitted\r\nattention of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe regular force amounts nearly to the number required by law, and is\r\nstationed along the Atlantic and inland frontiers.\r\n\r\nOf the naval force it has been necessary to maintain strong squadrons in\r\nthe Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nFrom several of the Indian tribes inhabiting the country bordering on\r\nLake Erie purchases have been made of lands on conditions very favorable\r\nto the United States, and, as it is presumed, not less so to the tribes\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nBy these purchases the Indian title, with moderate reservations, has\r\nbeen extinguished to the whole of the land within the limits of the\r\nState of Ohio, and to a part of that in the Michigan Territory and of\r\nthe State of Indiana. From the Cherokee tribe a tract has been purchased\r\nin the State of Georgia and an arrangement made by which, in exchange\r\nfor lands beyond the Mississippi, a great part, if not the whole, of the\r\nland belonging to that tribe eastward of that river in the States of\r\nNorth Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, and in the Alabama Territory\r\nwill soon be acquired. By these acquisitions, and others that may\r\nreasonably be expected soon to follow, we shall be enabled to extend our\r\nsettlements from the inhabited parts of the State of Ohio along Lake\r\nErie into the Michigan Territory, and to connect our settlements by\r\ndegrees through the State of Indiana and the Illinois Territory to\r\nthat of Missouri. A similar and equally advantageous effect will soon\r\nbe produced to the south, through the whole extent of the States and\r\nterritory which border on the waters emptying into the Mississippi and\r\nthe Mobile. In this progress, which the rights of nature demand and\r\nnothing can prevent, marking a growth rapid and gigantic, it is our duty\r\nto make new efforts for the preservation, improvement, and civilization\r\nof the native inhabitants. The hunter state can exist only in the vast\r\nuncultivated desert. It yields to the more dense and compact form and\r\ngreater force of civilized population; and of right it ought to yield,\r\nfor the earth was given to mankind to support the greatest number of\r\nwhich it is capable, and no tribe or people have a right to withhold\r\nfrom the wants of others more than is necessary for their own support\r\nand comfort. It is gratifying to know that the reservations of land made\r\nby the treaties with the tribes on Lake Erie were made with a view to\r\nindividual ownership among them and to the cultivation of the soil by\r\nall, and that an annual stipend has been pledged to supply their other\r\nwants. It will merit the consideration of Congress whether other\r\nprovision not stipulated by treaty ought to be made for these tribes and\r\nfor the advancement of the liberal and humane policy of the United\r\nStates toward all the tribes within our limits, and more particularly\r\nfor their improvement in the arts of civilized life.\r\n\r\nAmong the advantages incident to these purchases, and to those which\r\nhave preceded, the security which may thereby be afforded to our inland\r\nfrontiers is peculiarly important. With a strong barrier, consisting\r\nof our own people, thus planted on the Lakes, the Mississippi, and\r\nthe Mobile, with the protection to be derived from the regular force,\r\nIndian hostilities, if they do not altogether cease, will henceforth\r\nlose their terror. Fortifications in those quarters to any extent will\r\nnot be necessary, and the expense attending them may be saved. A people\r\naccustomed to the use of firearms only, as the Indian tribes are,\r\nwill shun even moderate works which are defended by cannon. Great\r\nfortifications will therefore be requisite only in future along the\r\ncoast and at some points in the interior connected with it. On these\r\nwill the safety of our towns and the commerce of our great rivers, from\r\nthe Bay of Fundy to the Mississippi, depend. On these, therefore, should\r\nthe utmost attention, skill, and labor be bestowed.\r\n\r\nA considerable and rapid augmentation in the value of all the public\r\nlands, proceeding from these and other obvious causes, may henceforward\r\nbe expected. The difficulties attending early emigrations will be\r\ndissipated even in the most remote parts. Several new States have been\r\nadmitted into our Union to the west and south, and Territorial\r\ngovernments, happily organized, established over every other portion in\r\nwhich there is vacant land for sale. In terminating Indian hostilities,\r\nas must soon be done, in a formidable shape at least, the emigration,\r\nwhich has heretofore been great, will probably increase, and the demand\r\nfor land and the augmentation in its value be in like proportion. The\r\ngreat increase of our population throughout the Union will alone produce\r\nan important effect, and in no quarter will it be so sensibly felt as in\r\nthose in contemplation. The public lands are a public stock, which ought\r\nto be disposed of to the best advantage for the nation. The nation\r\nshould therefore derive the profit proceeding from the continual rise\r\nin their value. Every encouragement should be given to the emigrants\r\nconsistent with a fair competition between them, but that competition\r\nshould operate in the first sale to the advantage of the nation rather\r\nthan of individuals. Great capitalists will derive all the benefit\r\nincident to their superior wealth under any mode of sale which may be\r\nadopted. But if, looking forward to the rise in the value of the public\r\nlands, they should have the opportunity of amassing at a low price vast\r\nbodies in their hands, the profit will accrue to them and not to the\r\npublic. They would also have the power in that degree to control the\r\nemigration and settlement in such a manner as their opinion of their\r\nrespective interests might dictate. I submit this subject to the\r\nconsideration of Congress, that such further provision may be made in\r\nthe sale of the public lands, with a view to the public interest, should\r\nany be deemed expedient, as in their judgment may be best adapted to the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the vast extent of territory within the United States,\r\nthe great amount and value of its productions, the connection of its\r\nparts, and other circumstances on which their prosperity and happiness\r\ndepend, we can not fail to entertain a high sense of the advantage to be\r\nderived from the facility which may be afforded in the intercourse\r\nbetween them by means of good roads and canals. Never did a country of\r\nsuch vast extent offer equal inducements to improvements of this kind,\r\nnor ever were consequences of such magnitude involved in them. As this\r\nsubject was acted on by Congress at the last session, and there may\r\nbe a disposition to revive it at the present, I have brought it into\r\nview for the purpose of communicating my sentiments on a very important\r\ncircumstance connected with it with that freedom and candor which a\r\nregard for the public interest and a proper respect for Congress\r\nrequire. A difference of opinion has existed from the first formation\r\nof our Constitution to the present time among our most enlightened and\r\nvirtuous citizens respecting the right of Congress to establish such a\r\nsystem of improvement. Taking into view the trust with which I am now\r\nhonored, it would be improper after what has passed that this discussion\r\nshould be revived with an uncertainty of my opinion respecting the\r\nright. Disregarding early impressions, I have bestowed on the subject\r\nall the deliberation which its great importance and a just sense of my\r\nduty required, and the result is a settled conviction in my mind that\r\nCongress do not possess the right. It is not contained in any of the\r\nspecified powers granted to Congress, nor can I consider it incidental\r\nto or a necessary means, viewed on the most liberal scale, for carrying\r\ninto effect any of the powers which are specifically granted. In\r\ncommunicating this result I can not resist the obligation which I feel\r\nto suggest to Congress the propriety of recommending to the States\r\nthe adoption of an amendment to the Constitution which shall give to\r\nCongress the right in question. In cases of doubtful construction,\r\nespecially of such vital interest, it comports with the nature and\r\norigin of our institutions, and will contribute much to preserve them,\r\nto apply to our constituents for an explicit grant of the power. We may\r\nconfidently rely that if it appears to their satisfaction that the power\r\nis necessary, it will always be granted.\r\n\r\nIn this case I am happy to observe that experience has afforded the most\r\nample proof of its utility, and that the benign spirit of conciliation\r\nand harmony which now manifests itself throughout our Union promises\r\nto such a recommendation the most prompt and favorable result. I think\r\nproper to suggest also, in case this measure is adopted, that it be\r\nrecommended to the States to include in the amendment sought a right\r\nin Congress to institute likewise seminaries of learning, for the\r\nall-important purpose of diffusing knowledge among our fellow-citizens\r\nthroughout the United States.\r\n\r\nOur manufactories will require the continued attention of Congress. The\r\ncapital employed in them is considerable, and the knowledge acquired in\r\nthe machinery and fabric of all the most useful manufactures is of great\r\nvalue. Their preservation, which depends on due encouragement is\r\nconnected with the high interests of the nation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the progress of the public buildings has been as favorable as\r\ncircumstances have permitted, it is to be regretted that the Capitol is\r\nnot yet in a state to receive you. There is good cause to presume that\r\nthe two wings, the only parts as yet commenced, will be prepared for\r\nthat purpose at the next session. The time seems now to have arrived\r\nwhen this subject may be deemed worthy the attention of Congress on\r\na scale adequate to national purposes. The completion of the middle\r\nbuilding will be necessary to the convenient accommodation of Congress,\r\nof the committees, and various offices belonging to it. It is evident\r\nthat the other public buildings are altogether insufficient for the\r\naccommodation of the several Executive Departments, some of whom are\r\nmuch crowded and even subjected to the necessity of obtaining it in\r\nprivate buildings at some distance from the head of the Department,\r\nand with inconvenience to the management of the public business. Most\r\nnations have taken an interest and a pride in the improvement and\r\nornament of their metropolis, and none were more conspicuous in that\r\nrespect than the ancient republics. The policy which dictated the\r\nestablishment of a permanent residence for the National Government and\r\nthe spirit in which it was commenced and has been prosecuted show that\r\nsuch improvement was thought worthy the attention of this nation. Its\r\ncentral position, between the northern and southern extremes of our\r\nUnion, and its approach to the west at the head of a great navigable\r\nriver which interlocks with the Western waters, prove the wisdom of the\r\ncouncils which established it.\r\n\r\nNothing appears to be more reasonable and proper than that convenient\r\naccommodation should be provided on a well-digested plan for the\r\nheads of the several Departments and for the Attorney-General, and\r\nit is believed that the public ground in the city applied to these\r\nobjects will be found amply sufficient. I submit this subject to the\r\nconsideration of Congress, that such further provision may be made in\r\nit as to them may seem proper.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the happy situation of the United States, our attention\r\nis drawn with peculiar interest to the surviving officers and soldiers\r\nof our Revolutionary army, who so eminently contributed by their\r\nservices to lay its foundation. Most of those very meritorious citizens\r\nhave paid the debt of nature and gone to repose. It is believed that\r\namong the survivors there are some not provided for by existing laws,\r\nwho are reduced to indigence and even to real distress. These men have a\r\nclaim on the gratitude of their country, and it will do honor to their\r\ncountry to provide for them. The lapse of a few years more and the\r\nopportunity will be forever lost; indeed, so long already has been the\r\ninterval that the number to be benefited by any provision which may be\r\nmade will not be great.\r\n\r\nIt appearing in a satisfactory manner that the revenue arising from\r\nimposts and tonnage and from the sale of the public lands will be fully\r\nadequate to the support of the civil Government, of the present military\r\nand naval establishments, including the annual augmentation of the\r\nlatter to the extent provided for, to the payment of the interest of the\r\npublic debt, and to the extinguishment of it at the times authorized,\r\nwithout the aid of the internal taxes, I consider it my duty to\r\nrecommend to Congress their repeal. To impose taxes when the public\r\nexigencies require them is an obligation of the most sacred character,\r\nespecially with a free people. The faithful fulfillment of it is among\r\nthe highest proofs of their virtue and capacity for self-government.\r\nTo dispense with taxes when it may be done with perfect safety is\r\nequally the duty of their representatives. In this instance we have\r\nthe satisfaction to know that they were imposed when the demand was\r\nimperious, and have been sustained with exemplary fidelity. I have to\r\nadd that however gratifying it may be to me regarding the prosperous and\r\nhappy condition of our country to recommend the repeal of these taxes at\r\nthis time, I shall nevertheless be attentive to events, and, should any\r\nfuture emergency occur, be not less prompt to suggest such measures and\r\nburdens as may then be requisite and proper.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2, 1817.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit to the Senate, for their consideration and advice, the\r\nfollowing treaties entered into with several of the Indian tribes,\r\nto wit:\r\n\r\nA treaty of peace and friendship made and concluded by William Clark,\r\nNinian Edwards, and Auguste Choteau, commissioners on the part of the\r\nUnited States of America, and the chiefs and warriors of the Menomene\r\ntribe or nation of Indians, on the 30th of March, 1817, at St. Louis.\r\n\r\nA treaty of peace and friendship made and concluded on the 4th June,\r\n1817, at St. Louis, by William Clark, Ninian Edwards, and Auguste\r\nChoteau, commissioners on the part of the United States of America,\r\nand the chiefs and warriors of the Ottoes tribe of Indians.\r\n\r\nA treaty of peace and friendship made and concluded on the 5th June,\r\n1817, at St. Louis, by William Clark, Ninian Edwards, and Auguste\r\nChoteau, commissioners on the part of the United States of America,\r\nand the chiefs and warriors of the Poncarar tribe of Indians.\r\n\r\nA treaty concluded at the Cherokee Agency on the 8th of July, 1817,\r\nbetween Major-General Andrew Jackson, Joseph McMinn, governor of the\r\nState of Tennessee, and General David Meriwether, commissioners of the\r\nUnited States of America, of the one part, and the chiefs, headmen, and\r\nwarriors of the Cherokee Nation east of the Mississippi River and the\r\nchiefs, headmen, and warriors of the Cherokees on the Arkansas River,\r\nand their deputies, John D. Chisholm and James Rogers.\r\n\r\nA treaty concluded on the 29th day of September, 1817, at the foot of\r\nthe Rapids of the Miami of Lake Erie, between Lewis Cass and Duncan\r\nMcArthur, commissioners of the United States, and the sachems, chiefs,\r\nand warriors of the Wyandot, Seneca, Delaware, Shawnese, Potawatamies,\r\nOttawas, and Chippewa tribes of Indians.\r\n\r\nThe Wyandots and other tribes parties to the treaty lately concluded\r\nwith them have, by a deputation to this city, requested permission to\r\nretain possession of such lands as they actually cultivate and reside\r\non, for the ensuing year. They have also expressed a desire that the\r\nreservations made in their favor should be enlarged, representing that\r\nthey had entered into the treaty in full confidence that that would be\r\ndone, preferring a reliance on the justice of the United States for such\r\nextension rather than that the treaty should fail.\r\n\r\nThe Wyandots claim an extension of their reservation to 16 miles square,\r\nand the other tribes in a proportional degree. Sufficient information is\r\nnot now in the possession of the Executive to enable it to decide how\r\nfar it may be proper to comply with the wishes of these tribes in the\r\nextent desired. The necessary information may be obtained in the course\r\nof the next year, and if they are permitted to remain in the possession\r\nof the lands they cultivate during that time such further extension of\r\ntheir reservations may be made by law at the next session as justice and\r\na liberal policy toward these people may require. It is submitted to the\r\nconsideration of the Senate whether it may not be proper to annex to\r\ntheir advice and consent for the ratification of the treaty a\r\ndeclaration providing for the above objects.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 11, 1817.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 15, 1817_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 8th of this month, I transmit, for the information of the House, a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State, with the documents referred to in it,\r\ncontaining all the information in the possession of the Executive which\r\nit is proper to disclose, relative to certain persons who lately took\r\npossession of Amelia Island and Galvezton.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 18, 1817.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 11th of this\r\nmonth, I transmit, for the information of the Senate, a report from the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, relating to the progress made in surveying\r\nthe several tracts of military bounty lands appropriated by Congress for\r\nthe late army of the United States, and the time at which such survey\r\nwill probably be completed.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 22, 1817.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n11th of this month, requesting to be informed of the present strength\r\nof the Army of the United States, its distribution among the several\r\nmilitary posts which it is designed to protect, and its competency to\r\npreserve and defend the fortifications amongst which it is distributed,\r\nand to aid in constructing such other military works, if any, as it may\r\nbe deemed proper to erect for the more effectual security of the United\r\nStates and of the Territories thereof, I now transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of War which contains the information desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 29, 1817.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 16th of this month,\r\nrequesting information touching the execution of so much of the first\r\narticle of the treaty of Ghent as relates to the restitution of slaves,\r\nwhich has not heretofore been communicated, I now transmit a report of\r\nthe Secretary of State on that subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 29, 1817.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n12th of this month, requesting to be informed whether any, and which, of\r\nthe Representatives in a list thereto annexed have held offices since\r\nthe 4th of March last, designating the offices, the times of appointment\r\nand acceptance, and whether they were at that time so held or when they\r\nhad been resigned, I now transmit a report from the Secretary of State\r\nwhich contains the information desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 12, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe claim of the representatives of the late Caron de Beaumarchais\r\nhaving been recommended to the favorable consideration of the\r\nLegislature by my predecessor in his message to Congress of the 31st of\r\nJanuary last, and concurring in the sentiments therein expressed, I now\r\ntransmit copies of a new representation relative to it received by the\r\nSecretary of State from the minister of France, and of a correspondence\r\non the subject between the minister of the United States at Paris and\r\nthe Duke of Richelieu, inclosed with that representation.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform Congress that the establishment at\r\nAmelia Island has been suppressed, and without the effusion of blood.\r\nThe papers which explain this transaction I now lay before Congress.\r\n\r\nBy the suppression of this establishment and of that at Galveztown,\r\nwhich will soon follow; if it has not already ceased to exist, there is\r\ngood cause to believe that the consummation of a project fraught with\r\nmuch injury to the United States has been prevented.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the persons engaged in it, being adventurers from\r\ndifferent countries, with very few, if any, of the native inhabitants\r\nof the Spanish colonies; the territory on which the establishments were\r\nmade--one on a portion of that claimed by the United States westward\r\nof the Mississippi, the other on a part of East Florida, a Province\r\nin negotiation between the United States and Spain; the claim of their\r\nleader as announced by his proclamation on taking possession of Amelia\r\nIsland, comprising the whole of both the Floridas, without excepting\r\nthat part of West Florida which is incorporated into the State of\r\nLouisiana; their conduct while in the possession of the island making it\r\ninstrumental to every species of contraband, and, in regard to slaves,\r\nof the most odious and dangerous character, it may fairly be concluded\r\nthat if the enterprise had succeeded on the scale on which it was formed\r\nmuch annoyance and injury would have resulted from it to the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOther circumstances were thought to be no less deserving of attention.\r\nThe institution of a government by foreign adventurers in the island,\r\ndistinct from the colonial governments of Buenos Ayres, Venezuela, or\r\nMexico, pretending to sovereignty and exercising its highest offices,\r\nparticularly in granting commissions to privateers, were acts which\r\ncould not fail to draw after them the most serious consequences. It was\r\nthe duty of the Executive either to extend to this establishment all the\r\nadvantages of that neutrality which the United States had proclaimed,\r\nand have observed in favor of the colonies of Spain who, by the strength\r\nof their own population and resources, had declared their independence\r\nand were affording strong proof of their ability to maintain it, or of\r\nmaking the discrimination which circumstances required.\r\n\r\nHad the first course been pursued, we should not only have sanctioned\r\nall the unlawful claims and practices of this pretended Government\r\nin regard to the United States, but have countenanced a system of\r\nprivateering in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere the ill effects of\r\nwhich might, and probably would, have been deeply and very extensively\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nThe path of duty was plain from the commencement, but it was painful to\r\nenter upon it while the obligation could be resisted. The law of 1811,\r\nlately published, and which it is therefore proper now to mention, was\r\nconsidered applicable to the case from the moment that the proclamation\r\nof the chief of the enterprise was seen, and its obligation was daily\r\nincreased by other considerations of high importance already mentioned,\r\nwhich were deemed sufficiently strong in themselves to dictate the\r\ncourse which has been pursued.\r\n\r\nEarly intimation having been received of the dangerous purposes of these\r\nadventurers, timely precautions were taken by the establishment of a\r\nforce near the St. Marys to prevent their effect, or it is probable that\r\nit would have been more sensibly felt.\r\n\r\nTo such establishments, made so near to our settlements in the\r\nexpectation of deriving aid from them, it is particularly gratifying\r\nto find that very little encouragement was given. The example so\r\nconspicuously displayed by our fellow-citizens that their sympathies\r\ncan not be perverted to improper purposes, but that a love of country,\r\nthe influence of moral principles, and a respect for the laws are\r\npredominant with them, is a sure pledge that all the very flattering\r\nanticipations which have been formed of the success of our institutions\r\nwill be realized. This example has proved that if our relations with\r\nforeign powers are to be changed it must be done by the constituted\r\nauthorities, who alone, acting on a high responsibility, are competent\r\nto the purpose, and until such change is thus made that our\r\nfellow-citizens will respect the existing relations by a faithful\r\nadherence to the laws which secure them.\r\n\r\nBelieving that this enterprise, though undertaken by persons some\r\nof whom may have held commissions from some of the colonies, was\r\nunauthorized by and unknown to the colonial governments, full confidence\r\nis entertained that it will be disclaimed by them, and that effectual\r\nmeasures will be taken to prevent the abuse of their authority in all\r\ncases to the injury of the United States.\r\n\r\nFor these injuries, especially those proceeding from Amelia Island,\r\nSpain would be responsible if it was not manifest that, though committed\r\nin the latter instance through her territory, she was utterly unable to\r\nprevent them. Her territory, however, ought not to be made instrumental,\r\nthrough her inability to defend it, to purposes so injurious to the\r\nUnited States. To a country over which she fails to maintain her\r\nauthority, and which she permits to be converted to the annoyance of her\r\nneighbors, her jurisdiction for the time necessarily ceases to exist.\r\nThe territory of Spain will nevertheless be respected so far as it may\r\nbe done consistently with the essential interests and safety of the\r\nUnited States. In expelling these adventurers from these posts it was\r\nnot intended to make any conquest from Spain or to injure in any degree\r\nthe cause of the colonies. Care will be taken that no part of the\r\nterritory contemplated by the law of 1811 shall be occupied by a\r\nforeign government of any kind, or that injuries of the nature of\r\nthose complained of shall be repeated; but this, it is expected, will\r\nbe provided for with every other interest in a spirit of amity in the\r\nnegotiation now depending with the Government of Spain.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 13, 1818.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 23, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n9th of December last, requesting information of what roads have been\r\nmade or are in progress under the authority of the Executive of the\r\nUnited States, the States and Territories through which they pass or are\r\nintended to pass, the periods when they were ordered to be made, and\r\nhow far they have been executed, I now communicate a report from the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, and likewise a report from the Secretary\r\nof War, containing the information which is desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 28, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 22d of this month,\r\nrequesting to be informed \"in what manner the troops in the service of\r\nthe United States now operating against the Seminole tribe of Indians\r\nhave been subsisted, whether by contract or otherwise, and whether they\r\nhave been furnished regularly with rations,\" I now transmit a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of War containing the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 29, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 23d of December last, requesting information relative to the\r\nimprisonment and detention in confinement of Richard W.

All the public\r\nfurniture provided before 1814 having been destroyed with the public\r\nbuildings in that year, and little afterwards procured, owing to the\r\ninadequacy of the appropriation, it has become necessary to provide\r\nalmost every article requisite for such an establishment, whence the\r\nsum to be expended will be much greater than at any former period. The\r\nfurniture in its kind and extent is thought to be an object not less\r\ndeserving attention than the building for which it is intended. Both\r\nbeing national objects, each seems to have an equal claim to legislative\r\nsanction. The disbursement of the public money, too, ought, it is\r\npresumed, to be in like manner provided for by law. The person who may\r\nhappen to be placed by the suffrage of his fellow-citizens in the high\r\ntrust, having no personal interest in these concerns, should be exempted\r\nfrom undue responsibility respecting them.\r\n\r\nFor a building so extensive, intended for a purpose exclusively\r\nnational, in which in the furniture provided for it a mingled regard\r\nis due to the simplicity and purity of our institutions and to the\r\ncharacter of the people who are represented in it, the sum already\r\nappropriated has proved altogether inadequate, The present is therefore\r\na proper time for Congress to take the subject into consideration, with\r\na view to all the objects claiming attention, and to regulate it by law.\r\nOn a knowledge of the furniture procured and the sum expended for it\r\na just estimate may be formed regarding the extent of the building of\r\nwhat will still be wanting to furnish the house. Many of the articles,\r\nbeing of a durable nature, may be handed down through a long series of\r\nservice, and being of great value, such as plate, ought not to be left\r\naltogether and at all times to the care of servants alone. It seems to\r\nbe advisable that a public agent Should be charged with it during the\r\noccasional absences of the President, and have authority to transfer\r\nit from one President to another, and likewise to make reports of\r\noccasional deficiencies, as the basis on which further provision should\r\nbe made.\r\n\r\nIt may also merit consideration whether it may not be proper to commit\r\nthe care of the public buildings, particularly the President's house and\r\nthe Capitol, with the grounds belonging to them, including likewise the\r\nfurniture of the latter, in a more special manner to a public agent.\r\nHitherto the charge of this valuable property seems to have been\r\nconnected with the structure of the buildings and committed to those\r\nemployed in it. This guard will necessarily cease when the buildings\r\nare finished, at which time the interest in them will be proportionably\r\naugmented. It is presumed that this trust is, in a certain degree at\r\nleast, incidental to the other duties of the superintendent of the\r\npublic buildings, but it may merit consideration whether it will not be\r\nproper to charge him with it more explicitly, and to give him authority\r\nto employ one or more persons under him for these purposes.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 12, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the House of Representatives copies of two communications\r\nreceived at the Department of State from the minister of Great Britain,\r\nand submit to their consideration the propriety of making such\r\nlegislative provisions as may be necessary for a compliance with the\r\nrepresentations contained in them.\r\n\r\nBy the express terms of that compact it was, when ratified by the two\r\nGovernments, to be in force for the term of four years _from the day of\r\nits signature_. The revocation of all the discriminating duties became,\r\ntherefore, the obligation of both Governments _from that day_, and it\r\nis conceived that every individual who has been required to pay, and\r\nwho has paid, any of the extra duties revoked by the convention has a\r\njust and lawful claim upon the respective Governments for its return.\r\nFrom various accidents it has happened that both here and in Great\r\nBritain the cessation of the extra duties has been fixed to commence\r\nat different times. It is desirable that Congress should pass an act\r\nproviding for the return of _all_ the extra duties _incompatible with\r\nthe terms of the convention_ which have been levied upon British vessels\r\nor merchandise after the 3d of July, 1815. The British Parliament have\r\nalready set the example of fixing that day for the cessation of the\r\nextra duties of export by their act of 30th of June last, and the\r\nminister of the United States in London is instructed to require the\r\nextension of the same principle to _all_ the extra duties levied on\r\nvessels and merchandise of the United States in the ports of Great\r\nBritain since that day. It is not doubted that the British Government\r\nwill comply with this requisition, and that the act suggested may be\r\npassed by Congress with full confidence that the reciprocal measure\r\nwill receive the sanction of the British Parliament.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate requesting me to cause to\r\nbe laid before them a statement of all the arms and accouterments which\r\nhave been manufactured at the different armories of the United States,\r\nwith the cost of each stand, and the number delivered to each State,\r\nrespectively, under the act for arming the whole body of militia, I now\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of War, with the documents marked\r\nA, B, and C, which, together with a report to him from the Ordnance\r\nDepartment, contains the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 19th of January,\r\n1818, requesting information of measures which have been taken in\r\npursuance of so much of the act to authorize the appointment of a\r\nsurveyor for lands in the northern part of the Mississippi Territory,\r\npassed the 3d of March, 1817, as relates to the reservation of certain\r\nsections for the purpose of laying out and establishing towns thereon,\r\nI now transmit a report from the Secretary of the Treasury, which, with\r\nthe letters and charts referred to in it, contains all the information\r\nwhich is desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 25, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe commissioners of the two Governments, under the fourth article\r\nof the treaty of Ghent, having come to a decision upon the questions\r\nsubmitted to them, I lay before Congress copies of that decision,\r\ntogether with copies of the declaration signed and reported by the\r\ncommissioners of this Government.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 27, 1818.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith to the House of Representatives a copy of a\r\nletter from the governor of the State of South Carolina to the Secretary\r\nof State, together with extracts from the journals of proceedings in\r\nboth branches of the legislature of that Commonwealth, relative to a\r\nproposed amendment of the Constitution, which letter and extracts are\r\nconnected with the subject of my communication to the House of the 6th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the House a report from the Secretary of State, together\r\nwith the papers relating to the claims of merchants of the United States\r\nupon the Government of Naples, in conformity with the resolution of the\r\nHouse of the 30th January last.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 11, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate requesting information\r\nrespecting the requisitions that were made on the contractors between\r\nthe 1st of June and the 24th of December, 1817, for deposits of\r\nprovisions in advance at the several posts on the frontiers of Georgia\r\nand the adjoining territory, their conduct in compliance therewith, the\r\namount of money advanced to B. G. Orr, and the extent of his failure,\r\nwith a copy of the articles of contract entered into with him, I now lay\r\nbefore the Senate a report from the Secretary of War, which, with the\r\ndocuments accompanying it, will afford the information desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 14, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 16th of December\r\nand of the House of Representatives of the 24th of February last,\r\nI lay before Congress a report of the Secretary of State, and the\r\npapers referred to in it, respecting the negotiation with the Government\r\nof Spain. To explain fully the nature of the differences between the\r\nUnited States and Spain and the conduct of the parties it has been found\r\nnecessary to go back to an early epoch. The recent correspondence,\r\nwith the documents accompanying it, will give a full view of the whole\r\nsubject, and place the conduct of the United States in every stage and\r\nunder every circumstance, for justice, moderation, and a firm adherence\r\nto their rights, on the high and honorable ground which it has\r\ninvariably sustained.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 16, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the United States of\r\nthe 31st of December last, requesting the President to cause to be laid\r\nbefore them a statement of the proceedings which may have been had under\r\nthe act of Congress passed on the 3d March, 1817, entitled \"An act to\r\nset apart and dispose of certain public lands for the encouragement and\r\ncultivation of the vine and olive,\" I now transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, containing all the information possessed by\r\nthe Executive relating to the proceedings under the said act.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 16, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the United States of\r\nthe 3d of February last, requesting the President to cause to be laid\r\nbefore them \"a statement of the progress made under the act to provide\r\nfor surveying the coast of the United States, passed February 10, 1807,\r\nand any subsequent acts on the same subject, and the expenses incurred\r\nthereby,\" I transmit a report from the Secretary of the Treasury\r\ncontaining the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 19, 1818.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn the course of the last summer a negotiation was commenced with\r\nthe Government of the Netherlands with a view to the revival and\r\nmodification of the commercial treaty existing between the two\r\ncountries, adapted to their present circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe report from the Secretary of State which I now lay before Congress\r\nwill show the obstacles which arose in the progress of the conferences\r\nbetween the respective plenipotentiaries, and which resulted in the\r\nagreement between them then to refer the subject to the consideration\r\nof their respective Governments. As the difficulties appear to be of a\r\nnature which may, perhaps, for the present be more easily removed by\r\nreciprocal legislative regulations, formed in the spirit of amity and\r\nconciliation, than by conventional stipulations, Congress may think it\r\nadvisable to leave the subsisting treaty in its present state, and to\r\nmeet the liberal exemption from discriminating tonnage duties which has\r\nbeen conceded in the Netherlands to the vessels of the United States\r\nby a similar exemption to the vessels of the Netherlands which have\r\narrived, or may hereafter arrive, in our ports, commencing from the time\r\nwhen the exemption was granted to the vessels of the United States. I\r\nwould further recommend to the consideration of Congress the expediency\r\nof extending the benefit of the same regulation, to commence from the\r\npassage of the law, to the vessels of Russia, Hamburg, and Bremen, and\r\nof making it prospectively general in favor of every nation in whose\r\nports the vessels of the United States are admitted on the same footing\r\nas their own.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 23, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate a report from the Secretary of the Navy, with\r\nthe estimate of the expense which will be incurred by the establishment\r\nof two dockyards for repairing vessels of the largest size.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 25, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress all the information in the possession of\r\nthe Executive respecting the war with the Seminoles, and the measures\r\nwhich it has been thought proper to adopt for the safety of our\r\nfellow-citizens on the frontier exposed to their ravages. The inclosed\r\ndocuments show that the hostilities of this tribe were unprovoked, the\r\noffspring of a spirit long cherished and often manifested toward the\r\nUnited States, and that in the present instance it was extending itself\r\nto other tribes and daily assuming a more serious aspect. As soon as the\r\nnature and object of this combination were perceived the major-general\r\ncommanding the Southern division of the troops of the United States was\r\nordered to the theater of action, charged with the management of the war\r\nand vested with the powers necessary to give it effect. The season of\r\nthe year being unfavorable to active operations, and the recesses of\r\nthe country affording shelter to these savages in case of retreat, may\r\nprevent a prompt termination of the war; but it may be fairly presumed\r\nthat it will not be long before this tribe and its associates receive\r\nthe punishment which they have provoked and justly merited.\r\n\r\nAs almost the whole of this tribe inhabits the country within the limits\r\nof Florida, Spain was bound by the treaty of 1795 to restrain them from\r\ncommitting hostilities against the United States. We have seen with\r\nregret that her Government has altogether failed to fulfill this\r\nobligation, nor are we aware that it made any effort to that effect.\r\nWhen we consider her utter inability to check, even in the slightest\r\ndegree, the movements of this tribe by her very small and incompetent\r\nforce in Florida, we are not disposed to ascribe the failure to any\r\nother cause. The inability, however, of Spain to maintain her authority\r\nover the territory and Indians within her limits, and in consequence to\r\nfulfill the treaty, ought not to expose the United States to other and\r\ngreater injuries. When the authority of Spain ceases to exist there, the\r\nUnited States have a right to pursue their enemy on a principle of\r\nself-defense. In this instance the right is more complete and obvious\r\nbecause we shall perform only what Spain was bound to have performed\r\nherself. To the high obligations and privileges of this great and sacred\r\nright of self-defense will the movement of our troops be strictly\r\nconfined. Orders have been given to the general in command not to enter\r\nFlorida unless it be in pursuit of the enemy, and in that case to\r\nrespect the Spanish authority wherever it is maintained; and he will be\r\ninstructed to withdraw his forces from the Province as soon as he shall\r\nhave reduced that tribe to order, and secure our fellow-citizens in that\r\nquarter by satisfactory arrangements against its unprovoked and savage\r\nhostilities in future.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 25, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n5th of December last, I now transmit a report of the Secretary of State,\r\nwith a copy of the documents which it is thought proper to communicate\r\nrelating to the independence and political condition of the Provinces of\r\nSpanish America,\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 26, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives, in compliance with their\r\nresolution of March 20, such information not heretofore communicated\r\nas is in the possession of the Executive relating to the occupation of\r\nAmelia Island. If any doubt had before existed of the improper conduct\r\nof the persons who authorized and of those who were engaged in the\r\ninvasion and previous occupancy of that island, of the unfriendly spirit\r\ntoward the United States with which it was commenced and prosecuted, and\r\nof its injurious effect on their highest interests, particularly by its\r\ntendency to compromit them with foreign powers in all the unwarrantable\r\nacts of the adventurers, it is presumed that these documents would\r\nremove it. It appears by the letter of Mr. Pazos, agent of Commodore\r\nAury, that the project of seizing the Floridas was formed and executed\r\nat a time when it was understood that Spain had resolved to cede them\r\nto the United States, and to prevent such cession from taking effect.\r\nThe whole proceeding in every stage and circumstance was unlawful. The\r\ncommission to General M'Gregor was granted at Philadelphia in direct\r\nviolation of a positive law, and all the measures pursued under it by\r\nhim in collecting his force and directing its movements were equally\r\nunlawful. With the conduct of these persons I have always been unwilling\r\nto connect any of the colonial governments, because I never could\r\nbelieve that they had given their sanction either to the project in its\r\norigin or to the measures which were pursued in the execution of it.\r\nThese documents confirm the opinion which I have invariably entertained\r\nand expressed in their favor.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 28, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate relative to the pensioners\r\nof the United States, the sum annually paid to each, and the States or\r\nTerritories in which said pensioners are respectively paid, I now\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of War, which, with documents\r\nmarked A and B, contains all the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 6, 1818.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAn arrangement having been made and concluded between this Government\r\nand that of Great Britain with respect to the naval armament of\r\nthe two Governments, respectively, on the Lakes, I lay before the\r\nSenate a copy of the correspondence upon that subject, including the\r\nstipulations mutually agreed upon by the two parties. I submit it to the\r\nconsideration of the Senate whether this is such an arrangement as the\r\nExecutive is competent to enter into by the powers vested in it by the\r\nConstitution, or is such an one as requires the advice and consent of\r\nthe Senate, and, in the latter case, for their advice and consent should\r\nit be approved.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 9, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate requesting me to cause\r\nto be laid before them a list of the names of the several agents of\r\nIndian affairs and of agents of Indian trading houses, with the pay and\r\nemolument of the agents, respectively, I now transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of War, which contains the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 10, 1818.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate respecting the supplies\r\nof the Northwestern army, within certain periods therein specified, by\r\ncontractors, commissaries, and agents, and the expense thereby incurred,\r\nI now transmit to them a report from the Secretary of War, which, with\r\nthe documents accompanying it, will afford the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 15, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 10th instant, relative to the capture and imprisonment of certain\r\npersons, citizens of the United States, therein specifically mentioned,\r\nI now transmit a report from the Secretary of State, which, with the\r\ndocuments accompanying it, embraces the objects contemplated by the\r\nsaid resolution.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 20, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a copy of the rules, regulations, and\r\ninstructions for the naval service of the United States, prepared by the\r\nBoard of Navy Commissioners in obedience to an act of Congress passed\r\n7th of February, 1815, entitled \"An act to alter and amend the several\r\nacts for establishing a Navy Department by adding thereto a Board of\r\nCommissioners.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the lieutenant-governor, council, and assembly of\r\nHis Britannic Majesty's Province of Nova Scotia, passed in the year\r\n1816, it was, among other things, enacted that from and after the 1st\r\nday of May of that year \"no plaster of paris, otherwise called gypsum,\r\nwhich should be laden or put on board any ship or vessel at any port\r\nor place within the limits of the said Province to be transported from\r\nthence to any other port or place within or without the said limits\r\nshould, directly or indirectly, be unladen or landed or put on shore at\r\nany port or place in the United States of America eastward of Boston,\r\nin the State of Massachusetts, nor unladen or put on board any American\r\nship, vessel, boat, or shallop of any description at any port or place\r\neastward of Boston aforesaid, under the penalty of the forfeiture of\r\nevery such ship or vessel from which any such plaster of paris, or\r\ngypsum, should be unladen contrary to the provision of the said act,\r\ntogether with her boats, tackle, apparel, and furniture, to be seized\r\nand prosecuted in the manner thereinafter mentioned;\" and\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the Congress of the United States passed on the\r\n3d day of March, 1817, it was enacted that from and after the 4th day\r\nof July then next no plaster of paris the production of any country or\r\nits dependencies from which the vessels of the United States were not\r\npermitted to bring the same article should be imported into the United\r\nStates in any foreign vessel, and that all plaster of paris imported or\r\nattempted to be imported into the United States contrary to the true\r\nintent and meaning of the said act of Congress, and the vessel in which\r\nthe same might be imported or attempted to be imported, together with\r\nthe cargo, tackle, apparel, and furniture, should be forfeited to the\r\nUnited States and liable to be seized, prosecuted, and condemned in the\r\nmanner therein prescribed;

and\r\n\r\nWhereas an act of the lieutenant-governor, council, and assembly\r\nof His Britannic Majesty's Province of Nova Scotia, repealing the\r\nabove-mentioned act of the said Province, passed in the year 1816, has\r\nbeen officially communicated by his said Majesty's envoy extraordinary\r\nand minister plenipotentiary to this Government;

that is--\r\n\r\n  On Lake Ontario, to one vessel not exceeding 100 tons burden and\r\n  armed with one 18-pound cannon.\r\n\r\n  On the upper lakes, to two vessels not exceeding like burden each\r\n  and armed with like force.\r\n\r\n  On the waters of Lake Champlain, to one vessel not exceeding like\r\n  burden and armed with like force.\r\n\r\n  All other armed vessels on these lakes shall be forthwith dismantled,\r\n  and no other vessels of war shall be there built or armed.\r\n\r\n  If either party should hereafter be-desirous of annulling this\r\n  stipulation, and should give notice to that effect to the other\r\n  party, it shall cease to be binding after the expiration of six\r\n  months from the date of such notice.\r\n\r\n  The naval force so to be limited shall be restricted to such services\r\n  as will in no respect interfere with the proper duties of the armed\r\n  vessels of the other party.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the Senate of the United States have approved of the said\r\narrangement and recommended that it should be carried into effect, the\r\nsame having also received the sanction of His Royal Highness the Prince\r\nRegent, acting in the name and on the behalf of His Britannic Majesty:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Monroe, President of the United States, do\r\nby this my proclamation make known and declare that the arrangement\r\naforesaid and every stipulation thereof has been duly entered into,\r\nconcluded, and confirmed, and is of full force and effect.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of Washington, this 28th day of\r\nApril, A.D. 1818, and of the Independence of the United States the\r\nforty-second.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  John Quincy Adams,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas it appears by a proclamation of the lieutenant-governor of His\r\nBritannic Majesty's Province of New Brunswick bearing date the 10th day\r\nof April last, and officially communicated by his envoy extraordinary\r\nand minister plenipotentiary residing in the United States to this\r\nGovernment, that the regulations on the subject of the trade in plaster\r\nof paris, prohibiting the exportation thereof to certain ports of the\r\nUnited States, which were in force in the said Province at the time of\r\nthe enactment of the act of the Congress of the United States entitled\r\n\"An act to regulate the trade in plaster of paris,\" passed on the 3d day\r\nof March, 1817, have been and are discontinued:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Monroe, President of the United States, do\r\nhereby declare that fact, and that the restrictions imposed by the said\r\nact of Congress shall from the date hereof cease and be discontinued in\r\nrelation to the said Province of New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of Washington, this 4th day of July,\r\nA.D. 1818, and in the forty-third year of the Independence of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  John Quincy Adams,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 3d of\r\nMarch, 1815, so much of the several acts imposing duties on the ships\r\nand vessels and on goods, wares, and merchandise imported into the\r\nUnited States as imposed a discriminating duty of tonnage between\r\nforeign vessels and vessels of the United States and between goods\r\nimported into the United States in foreign vessels and vessels of the\r\nUnited States were repealed so far as the same respected the produce or\r\nmanufacture of the nation to which such foreign ship or vessel might\r\nbelong, such repeal to take effect in favor of any foreign nation\r\nwhenever the President of the United States should be satisfied that the\r\ndiscriminating or countervailing duties of such foreign nation so far as\r\nthey operate to the disadvantage of the United States have been\r\nabolished;

The fruits of the earth have been unusually\r\nabundant, commerce has flourished, the revenue has exceeded the most\r\nfavorable anticipation, and peace and amity are preserved with foreign\r\nnations on conditions just and honorable to our country. For these\r\ninestimable blessings we can not but be grateful to that Providence\r\nwhich watches over the destiny of nations.\r\n\r\nAs the term limited for the operation of the commercial convention with\r\nGreat Britain will expire early in the month of July next, and it was\r\ndeemed important that there should be no interval during which that\r\nportion of our commerce which was provided for by that convention should\r\nnot be regulated, either by arrangement between the two Governments or\r\nby the authority of Congress, the minister of the United States at\r\nLondon was instructed early in the last summer to invite the attention\r\nof the British Government to the subject, with a view to that object.\r\nHe was instructed to propose also that the negotiation which it\r\nwas wished to open might extend to the general commerce of the two\r\ncountries, and to every other interest and unsettled difference between\r\nthem, particularly those relating to impressment, the fisheries, and\r\nboundaries, in the hope that an arrangement might be made on principles\r\nof reciprocal advantage which might comprehend and provide in a\r\nsatisfactory manner for all these high concerns. I have the satisfaction\r\nto state that the proposal was received by the British Government in\r\nthe spirit which prompted it, and that a negotiation has been opened at\r\nLondon embracing all these objects. On full consideration of the great\r\nextent and magnitude of the trust it was thought proper to commit it to\r\nnot less than two of our distinguished citizens, and in consequence the\r\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United States\r\nat Paris has been associated with our envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary at London, to both of whom corresponding instructions\r\nhave been given, and they are now engaged in the discharge of its\r\nduties. It is proper to add that to prevent any inconvenience resulting\r\nfrom the delay incident to a negotiation on so many important subjects\r\nit was agreed before entering on it that the existing convention should\r\nbe continued for a term not less than eight years.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Spain remain nearly in the state in which they were\r\nat the close of the last session. The convention of 1802, providing for\r\nthe adjustment of a certain portion of the claims of our citizens for\r\ninjuries sustained by spoliation, and so long suspended by the Spanish\r\nGovernment, has at length been ratified by it, but no arrangement has\r\nyet been made for the payment of another portion of like claims, not\r\nless extensive or well founded, or for other classes of claims, or for\r\nthe settlement of boundaries. These subjects have again been brought\r\nunder consideration in both countries, but no agreement has been entered\r\ninto respecting them. In the meantime events have occurred which clearly\r\nprove the ill effect of the policy which that Government has so long\r\npursued on the friendly relations of the two countries, which it is\r\npresumed is at least of as much importance to Spain as to the United\r\nStates to maintain. A state of things has existed in the Floridas the\r\ntendency of which has been obvious to all who have paid the slightest\r\nattention to the progress of affairs in that quarter. Throughout\r\nthe whole of those Provinces to which the Spanish title extends the\r\nGovernment of Spain has scarcely been felt. Its authority has been\r\nconfined almost exclusively to the walls of Pensacola and St. Augustine,\r\nwithin which only small garrisons have been maintained. Adventurers from\r\nevery country, fugitives from justice, and absconding slaves have found\r\nan asylum there. Several tribes of Indians, strong in the number of\r\ntheir warriors, remarkable for their ferocity, and whose settlements\r\nextend to our limits, inhabit those Provinces. These different hordes of\r\npeople, connected together, disregarding on the one side the authority\r\nof Spain, and protected on the other by an imaginary line which\r\nseparates Florida from the United States, have violated our laws\r\nprohibiting the introduction of slaves, have practiced various frauds\r\non our revenue, and committed every kind of outrage on our peaceable\r\ncitizens which their proximity to us enabled them to perpetrate. The\r\ninvasion of Amelia Island last year by a small band of adventurers, not\r\nexceeding 150 in number, who wrested it from the inconsiderable Spanish\r\nforce stationed there, and held it several months, during which a single\r\nfeeble effort only was made to recover it, which failed, clearly proves\r\nhow completely extinct the Spanish authority had become, as the conduct\r\nof those adventurers while in possession of the island as distinctly\r\nshows the pernicious purposes for which their combination had been\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThis country had, in fact, become the theater of every species of\r\nlawless adventure. With little population of its own, the Spanish\r\nauthority almost extinct, and the colonial governments in a state of\r\nrevolution, having no pretension to it, and sufficiently employed in\r\ntheir own concerns, it was in a great measure derelict, and the object\r\nof cupidity to every adventurer. A system of buccaneering was rapidly\r\norganizing over it which menaced in its consequences the lawful commerce\r\nof every nation, and particularly of the United States, while it\r\npresented a temptation to every people, on whose seduction its success\r\nprincipally depended. In regard to the United States, the pernicious\r\neffect of this unlawful combination was not confined to the ocean;\r\nthe Indian tribes have constituted the effective force in Florida.\r\nWith these tribes these adventurers had formed at an early period a\r\nconnection with a view to avail themselves of that force to promote\r\ntheir own projects of accumulation and aggrandizement. It is to the\r\ninterference of some of these adventurers, in misrepresenting the claims\r\nand titles of the Indians to land and in practicing on their savage\r\npropensities, that the Seminole war is principally to be traced. Men who\r\nthus connect themselves with savage communities and stimulate them to\r\nwar, which is always attended on their part with acts of barbarity the\r\nmost shocking, deserve to be viewed in a worse light than the savages.\r\nThey would certainly have no claim to an immunity from the punishment\r\nwhich, according to the rules of warfare practiced by the savages, might\r\njustly be inflicted on the savages themselves.\r\n\r\nIf the embarrassments of Spain prevented her from making an indemnity\r\nto our citizens for so long a time from her treasury for their losses\r\nby spoliation and otherwise, it was always in her power to have provided\r\nit by the cession of this territory. Of this her Government has been\r\nrepeatedly apprised, and the cession was the more to have been\r\nanticipated as Spain must have known that in ceding it she would in\r\neffect cede what had become of little value to her, and would likewise\r\nrelieve herself from the important obligation secured by the treaty of\r\n1795 and all other compromitments respecting it. If the United States,\r\nfrom consideration of these embarrassments, declined pressing their\r\nclaims in a spirit of hostility, the motive ought at least to have been\r\nduly appreciated by the Government of Spain. It is well known to her\r\nGovernment that other powers have made to the United States an indemnity\r\nfor like losses sustained by their citizens at the same epoch.\r\n\r\nThere is nevertheless a limit beyond which this spirit of amity and\r\nforbearance can in no instance be justified. If it was proper to rely on\r\namicable negotiation for an indemnity for losses, it would not have been\r\nso to have permitted the inability of Spain to fulfill her engagements\r\nand to sustain her authority in the Floridas to be perverted by foreign\r\nadventurers and savages to purposes so destructive to the lives of our\r\nfellow-citizens and the highest interests of the United States. The\r\nright of self-defense never ceases. It is among the most sacred, and\r\nalike necessary to nations and to individuals, and whether the attack be\r\nmade by Spain herself or by those who abuse her power, its obligation is\r\nnot the less strong. The invaders of Amelia Island had assumed a popular\r\nand respected title under which they might approach and wound us. As\r\ntheir object was distinctly seen, and the duty imposed on the Executive\r\nby an existing law was profoundly felt, that mask was not permitted to\r\nprotect them. It was thought incumbent on the United States to suppress\r\nthe establishment, and it was accordingly done. The combination in\r\nFlorida for the unlawful purposes stated, the acts perpetrated by that\r\ncombination, and, above all, the incitement of the Indians to massacre\r\nour fellow-citizens of every age and of both sexes, merited a like\r\ntreatment and received it. In pursuing these savages to an imaginary\r\nline in the woods it would have been the height of folly to have\r\nsuffered that line to protect them. Had that been done the war could\r\nnever cease. Even if the territory had been exclusively that of Spain\r\nand her power complete over it, we had a right by the law of nations\r\nto follow the enemy on it and to subdue him there. But the territory\r\nbelonged, in a certain sense at least, to the savage enemy who inhabited\r\nit; the power of Spain had ceased to exist over it, and protection\r\nwas sought under her title by those who had committed on our citizens\r\nhostilities which she was bound by treaty to have prevented, but had not\r\nthe power to prevent. To have stopped at that line would have given new\r\nencouragement to these savages and new vigor to the whole combination\r\nexisting there in the prosecution of all its pernicious purposes.\r\n\r\nIn suppressing the establishment at Amelia Island no unfriendliness was\r\nmanifested toward Spain, because the post was taken from a force which\r\nhad wrested it from her. The measure, it is true, was not adopted in\r\nconcert with the Spanish Government or those in authority under it,\r\nbecause in transactions connected with the war in which Spain and the\r\ncolonies are engaged it was thought proper in doing justice to the\r\nUnited States to maintain a strict impartiality toward both the\r\nbelligerent parties without consulting or acting in concert with either.\r\nIt gives me pleasure to state that the Governments of Buenos Ayres and\r\nVenezuela, whose names were assumed, have explicitly disclaimed all\r\nparticipation in those measures, and even the knowledge of them until\r\ncommunicated by this Government, and have also expressed their\r\nsatisfaction that a course of proceedings had been suppressed which if\r\njustly imputable to them would dishonor their cause.\r\n\r\nIn authorizing Major-General Jackson to enter Florida in pursuit of the\r\nSeminoles care was taken not to encroach on the rights of Spain. I\r\nregret to have to add that in executing this order facts were disclosed\r\nrespecting the conduct of the officers of Spain in authority there in\r\nencouraging the war, furnishing munitions of war and other supplies to\r\ncarry it on, and in other acts not less marked which evinced their\r\nparticipation in the hostile purposes of that combination and justified\r\nthe confidence with which it inspired the savages that by those officers\r\nthey would be protected. A conduct so incompatible with the friendly\r\nrelations existing between the two countries, particularly with the\r\npositive obligation of the fifth article of the treaty of 1795, by which\r\nSpain was bound to restrain, even by force, those savages from acts of\r\nhostility against the United States, could not fail to excite surprise.\r\nThe commanding general was convinced that he should fail in his object,\r\nthat he should in effect accomplish nothing, if he did not deprive\r\nthose savages of the resource on which they had calculated and of the\r\nprotection on which they had relied in making the war. As all the\r\ndocuments relating to this occurrence will be laid before Congress,\r\nit is not necessary to enter into further detail respecting it.\r\n\r\nAlthough the reasons which induced Major-General Jackson to take these\r\nposts were duly appreciated, there was nevertheless no hesitation in\r\ndeciding on the course which it became the Government to pursue. As\r\nthere was reason to believe that the commanders of these posts had\r\nviolated their instructions, there was no disposition to impute to\r\ntheir Government a conduct so unprovoked and hostile. An order was\r\nin consequence issued to the general in command there to deliver the\r\nposts--Pensacola unconditionally to any person duly authorized to\r\nreceive it, and St. Marks, which is in the heart of the Indian country,\r\non the arrival of a competent force to defend it against those savages\r\nand their associates.\r\n\r\nIn entering Florida to suppress this combination no idea was entertained\r\nof hostility to Spain, and however justifiable the commanding general\r\nwas, in consequence of the misconduct of the Spanish officers, in\r\nentering St. Marks and Pensacola to terminate it by proving to the\r\nsavages and their associates that they should not be protected even\r\nthere, yet the amicable relations existing between the United States\r\nand Spain could not be altered by that act alone. By ordering the\r\nrestitution of the posts those relations were preserved. To a change\r\nof them the power of the Executive is deemed incompetent; it is vested\r\nin Congress only.\r\n\r\nBy this measure, so promptly taken, due respect was shown to the\r\nGovernment of Spain. The misconduct of her officers has not been imputed\r\nto her. She was enabled to review with candor her relations with the\r\nUnited States and her own situation, particularly in respect to the\r\nterritory in question, with the dangers inseparable from it, and\r\nregarding the losses we have sustained for which indemnity has been so\r\nlong withheld, and the injuries we have suffered through that territory,\r\nand her means of redress, she was likewise enabled to take with honor\r\nthe course best calculated to do justice to the United States and to\r\npromote her own welfare.\r\n\r\nCopies of the instructions to the commanding general, of his\r\ncorrespondence with the Secretary of War, explaining his motives\r\nand justifying his conduct, with a copy of the proceedings of the\r\ncourts-martial in the trial of Arbuthnot and Ambristie, and of the\r\ncorrespondence between the Secretary of State and the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of Spain near this Government, and of the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States at Madrid with the Government\r\nof Spain, will be laid before Congress.\r\n\r\nThe civil war which has so long prevailed between Spain and the\r\nProvinces in South America still continues, without any prospect of\r\nits speedy termination. The information respecting the condition of\r\nthose countries which has been collected by the commissioners recently\r\nreturned from thence will be laid before Congress in copies of their\r\nreports, with such other information as has been received from other\r\nagents of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt appears from these communications that the Government at Buenos Ayres\r\ndeclared itself independent in July, 1816, having previously exercised\r\nthe power of an independent government, though in the name of the King\r\nof Spain, from the year 1810; that the Banda Oriental, Entre Rios, and\r\nParaguay, with the city of Santa Fee, all of which are also independent,\r\nare unconnected with the present Government of Buenos Ayres; that Chili\r\nhas declared itself independent and is closely connected with Buenos\r\nAyres; that Venezuela has also declared itself independent, and now\r\nmaintains the conflict with various success; and that the remaining\r\nparts of South America, except Monte Video and such other portions of\r\nthe eastern bank of the La Plata as are held by Portugal, are still in\r\nthe possession of Spain or in a certain degree under her influence.\r\n\r\nBy a circular note addressed by the ministers of Spain to the allied\r\npowers, with whom they are respectively accredited, it appears that the\r\nallies have undertaken to mediate between Spain and the South American\r\nProvinces, and that the manner and extent of their interposition would\r\nbe settled by a congress which was to have met at Aix-la-Chapelle\r\nin September last. From the general policy and course of proceeding\r\nobserved by the allied powers in regard to this contest it is inferred\r\nthat they will confine their interposition to the expression of their\r\nsentiments, abstaining from the application of force. I state this\r\nimpression that force will not be applied with the greater satisfaction\r\nbecause it is a course more consistent with justice and likewise\r\nauthorizes a hope that the calamities of the war will be confined\r\nto the parties only, and will be of shorter duration.\r\n\r\nFrom the view taken of this subject, founded on all the information that\r\nwe have been able to obtain, there is good cause to be satisfied with\r\nthe course heretofore pursued by the United States in regard to this\r\ncontest, and to conclude that it is proper to adhere to it, especially\r\nin the present state of affairs.\r\n\r\nI have great satisfaction in stating that our relations with France,\r\nRussia, and other powers continue on the most friendly basis.\r\n\r\nIn our domestic concerns we have ample cause of satisfaction. The\r\nreceipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters of the year\r\nhave exceeded $17,000,000.\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying all the demands which have been made under existing\r\nappropriations, including the final extinction of the old 6 per cent\r\nstock and the redemption of a moiety of the Louisiana debt, it is\r\nestimated that there will remain in the Treasury on the 1st day of\r\nJanuary next more than $2,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained that the gross revenue which has accrued from the\r\ncustoms during the same period amounts to $21,000,000, and that the\r\nrevenue of the whole year may be estimated at not less than $26,000,000.\r\nThe sale of the public lands during the year has also greatly exceeded,\r\nboth in quantity and price, that of any former year, and there is just\r\nreason to expect a progressive improvement in that source of revenue.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that although the annual expenditure has been\r\nincreased by the act of the last session of Congress providing for\r\nRevolutionary pensions to an amount about equal to the proceeds of the\r\ninternal duties which were then repealed, the revenue for the ensuing\r\nyear will be proportionally augmented, and that whilst the public\r\nexpenditure will probably remain stationary, each successive year will\r\nadd to the national resources by the ordinary increase of our population\r\nand by the gradual development of our latent sources of national\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nThe strict execution of the revenue laws, resulting principally from\r\nthe salutary provisions of the act of the 20th of April last amending\r\nthe several collection laws, has, it is presumed, secured to domestic\r\nmanufactures all the relief that can be derived from the duties which\r\nhave been imposed upon foreign merchandise for their protection. Under\r\nthe influence of this relief several branches of this important national\r\ninterest have assumed greater activity, and although it is hoped that\r\nothers will gradually revive and ultimately triumph over every obstacle,\r\nyet the expediency of granting further protection is submitted to your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe measures of defense authorized by existing laws have been pursued\r\nwith the zeal and activity due to so important an object, and with all\r\nthe dispatch practicable in so extensive and great an undertaking. The\r\nsurvey of our maritime and inland frontiers has been continued, and at\r\nthe points where it was decided to erect fortifications the work has\r\nbeen commenced, and in some instances considerable progress has been\r\nmade. In compliance with resolutions of the last session, the Board of\r\nCommissioners were directed to examine in a particular manner the parts\r\nof the coast therein designated and to report their opinion of the\r\nmost suitable sites for two naval depots. This work is in a train of\r\nexecution. The opinion of the Board on this subject, with a plan of all\r\nthe works necessary to a general system of defense so far as it has been\r\nformed, will be laid before Congress in a report from the proper\r\ndepartment as soon as it can be prepared.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the appropriations of the last session, treaties have\r\nbeen formed with the Quapaw tribe of Indians, inhabiting the country on\r\nthe Arkansaw, and with the Great and Little Osages north of the White\r\nRiver; with the tribes in the State of Indiana; with the several tribes\r\nwithin the State of Ohio and the Michigan Territory, and with the\r\nChickasaws, by which very extensive cessions of territory have been made\r\nto the United States. Negotiations are now depending with the tribes in\r\nthe Illinois Territory and with the Choctaws, by which it is expected\r\nthat other extensive cessions will be made. I take great interest\r\nin stating that the cessions already made, which are considered so\r\nimportant to the United States, have been obtained on conditions very\r\nsatisfactory to the Indians.\r\n\r\nWith a view to the security of our inland frontiers, it has been thought\r\nexpedient to establish strong posts at the mouth of Yellow Stone River\r\nand at the Mandan village on the Missouri, and at the mouth of St.\r\nPeters on the Mississippi, at no great distance from our northern\r\nboundaries. It can hardly be presumed while such posts are maintained\r\nin the rear of the Indian tribes that they will venture to attack our\r\npeaceable inhabitants. A strong hope is entertained that this measure\r\nwill likewise be productive of much good to the tribes themselves,\r\nespecially in promoting the great object of their civilization.\r\nExperience has clearly demonstrated that independent savage communities\r\ncan not long exist within the limits of a civilized population.\r\nThe progress of the latter has almost invariably terminated in the\r\nextinction of the former, especially of the tribes belonging to our\r\nportion of this hemisphere, among whom loftiness of sentiment and\r\ngallantry in action have been conspicuous. To civilize them, and even\r\nto prevent their extinction, it seems to be indispensable that their\r\nindependence as communities should cease, and that the control of the\r\nUnited States over them should be complete and undisputed. The hunter\r\nstate will then be more easily abandoned, and recourse will be had to\r\nthe acquisition and culture of land and to other pursuits tending to\r\ndissolve the ties which connect them together as a savage community and\r\nto give a new character to every individual. I present this subject to\r\nthe consideration of Congress on the presumption that it may be found\r\nexpedient and practicable to adopt some benevolent provisions, having\r\nthese objects in view, relative to the tribes within our settlements.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary during the present year to maintain a strong naval\r\nforce in the Mediterranean and in the Gulf of Mexico, and to send some\r\npublic ships along the southern coast and to the Pacific Ocean. By\r\nthese means amicable relations with the Barbary Powers have been\r\npreserved, our commerce has been protected, and our rights respected.\r\nThe augmentation of our Navy is advancing with a steady progress toward\r\nthe limit contemplated by law.\r\n\r\nI communicate with great satisfaction the accession of another State\r\n(Illinois) to our Union, because I perceive from the proof afforded by\r\nthe additions already made the regular progress and sure consummation of\r\na policy of which history affords no example, and of which the good\r\neffect can not be too highly estimated. By extending our Government on\r\nthe principles of our Constitution over the vast territory within our\r\nlimits, on the Lakes and the Mississippi and its numerous streams, new\r\nlife and vigor are infused into every part of our system. By increasing\r\nthe number of the States the confidence of the State governments in\r\ntheir own security is increased and their jealousy of the National\r\nGovernment proportionally diminished. The impracticability of one\r\nconsolidated government for this great and growing nation will be more\r\napparent and will be universally admitted. Incapable of exercising local\r\nauthority except for general purposes, the General Government will\r\nno longer be dreaded. In those cases of a local nature and for all\r\nthe great purposes for which it was instituted its authority will be\r\ncherished. Each government will acquire new force and a greater freedom\r\nof action within its proper sphere. Other inestimable advantages will\r\nfollow. Our produce will be augmented to an incalculable amount in\r\narticles of the greatest value for domestic use and foreign commerce.\r\nOur navigation will in like degree be increased, and as the shipping of\r\nthe Atlantic States will be employed in the transportation of the vast\r\nproduce of the Western country, even those parts of the United States\r\nwhich are most remote from each other will be further bound together by\r\nthe strongest ties which mutual interest can create.\r\n\r\nThe situation of this District, it is thought, requires the attention of\r\nCongress. By the Constitution the power of legislation is exclusively\r\nvested in the Congress of the United States. In the exercise of this\r\npower, in which the people have no participation, Congress legislate in\r\nall cases directly on the local concerns of the District. As this is a\r\ndeparture, for a special purpose, from the general principles of our\r\nsystem, it may merit consideration whether an arrangement better adapted\r\nto the principles of our Government and to the particular interests\r\nof the people may not be devised which will neither infringe the\r\nConstitution nor affect the object which the provision in question\r\nwas intended to secure. The growing population, already considerable,\r\nand the increasing business of the District, which it is believed\r\nalready interferes with the deliberations of Congress on great national\r\nconcerns, furnish additional motives for recommending this subject to\r\nyour consideration.\r\n\r\nWhen we view the great blessings with which our country has been\r\nfavored, those which we now enjoy, and the means which we possess of\r\nhanding them down unimpaired to our latest posterity, our attention is\r\nirresistibly drawn to the source from whence they flow. Let us, then,\r\nunite in offering our most grateful acknowledgments for these blessings\r\nto the Divine Author of All Good.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 30, 1818.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate, for their advice and consent, the several\r\ntreaties which have recently been made with the Chickasaws, the Quapaws,\r\nthe Wyandot, Seneca, Delaware, Shawnese, Potawatamies, Ottawas, and\r\nChippewas, the Peoria, Kaskaskias, Mitchigamia, Cahokia, and Tamarois,\r\nthe Great and Little Osages, the Weas, Potawatamies, Delaware and Miami,\r\nthe Wyandot, and the four Pawnees tribes of Indians.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the journal of the commissioners it appears that George\r\nand Levi Colbert have bargained and sold to the United States the\r\nreservations made to them by the treaty of September, 1816, and that\r\na deed of trust of the same has been made by them to James Jackson,\r\nof Nashville. I would therefore suggest, in case the Chickasaw treaty\r\nbe approved by the Senate, the propriety of providing by law for\r\nthe payment of the sum stipulated to be given to them for their\r\nreservations.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2, 1818.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate copies of such of the documents referred to in\r\nthe message of the 17th of last month as have been prepared since that\r\nperiod. They contain a copy of the reports of Mr. Rodney and Mr. Graham,\r\ntwo of the commissioners to South America, who returned first from the\r\nmission, and of the papers connected with those reports. They also\r\npresent a full view of the operations of our troops employed in the\r\nSeminole war in Florida.\r\n\r\nIt would have been gratifying to me to have communicated with the\r\nmessage all the documents referred to in it, but as two of our\r\ncommissioners from South America made their reports a few days only\r\nbefore the meeting of Congress and the third on the day of its meeting,\r\nit was impossible to transmit at that time more than one copy of the\r\ntwo reports first made.\r\n\r\nThe residue of the documents will be communicated as soon as they are\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 2, 1818_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of 25th of last month,\r\nrequesting to be furnished with such information as may be possessed by\r\nthe Executive touching the execution of so much of the first article of\r\nthe late treaty of peace and amity between His Britannic Majesty and the\r\nUnited States as relates to the restitution of slaves, and which has not\r\nheretofore been communicated, I lay before the Senate a report made by\r\nthe Secretary of State on the 1st instant in relation to that subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2, 1818.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives copies of such documents\r\nreferred to in the message of the 17th ultimo as have been prepared\r\nsince that period.

It will appear\r\nfrom these documents that the vessels of the United States and the\r\nmerchandise laden in them are in the ports of those Governments,\r\nrespectively, entitled to the same advantages in respect to imposts and\r\nduties as those of the native subjects of the countries themselves.\r\n\r\nThe principle of reciprocity appears to entitle them to the return of\r\nthe same favor on the part of the United States, and I recommend it to\r\nCongress that provision to that effect may be made.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 22, 1819.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a treaty of amity, settlement, and limits\r\nbetween the United States of America and His Catholic Majesty,\r\nconcluded and signed this day, for the decision of the Senate as to\r\nits ratification. Copies of the correspondence between the Secretary\r\nof State and the minister from Spain connected with this subject since\r\nthe renewal of the negotiation are likewise inclosed.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 26, 1819_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe treaty of amity, settlement, and limits between the United States\r\nand His Catholic Majesty having been on the part of the United States\r\nratified, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, copies of\r\nit are now transmitted to Congress. As the ratification on the part\r\nof Spain may be expected to take place during the recess of Congress,\r\nI recommend to their consideration the adoption of such legislative\r\nmeasures contingent upon the event of the exchange of the ratifications\r\nas may be necessary or expedient for carrying the treaty into effect\r\nin the interval between the sessions, and until Congress at their next\r\nsession may see fit to make further provision on the subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 2, 1819.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nA convention having been concluded between John C. Calhoun, Secretary of\r\nWar, especially authorized therefor by me, and the chiefs and headmen of\r\nthe Cherokee Nation of Indians, likewise duly authorized and empowered\r\nby said nation, I now lay the original instrument before the Senate for\r\nthe exercise of its constitutional power respecting the ratification\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1819_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe public buildings being advanced to a stage to afford accommodation\r\nfor Congress, I offer you my sincere congratulations on the\r\nrecommencement of your duties in the Capitol.\r\n\r\nIn bringing to view the incidents most deserving attention which have\r\noccurred since your last session, I regret to have to state that several\r\nof our principal cities have suffered by sickness, that an unusual\r\ndrought has prevailed in the Middle and Western States, and that a\r\nderangement has been felt in some of our moneyed institutions which has\r\nproportionably affected their credit. I am happy, however, to have it in\r\nmy power to assure you that the health of our cities is now completely\r\nrestored; that the produce of the year, though less abundant than usual,\r\nwill not only be amply sufficient for home consumption, but afford a\r\nlarge surplus for the supply of the wants of other nations, and that the\r\nderangement in the circulating paper medium, by being left to those\r\nremedies which its obvious causes suggested and the good sense and\r\nvirtue of our fellow-citizens supplied, has diminished.\r\n\r\nHaving informed Congress, on the 27th of February last, that a treaty of\r\namity, settlement, and limits had been concluded in this city between\r\nthe United States and Spain, and ratified by the competent authorities\r\nof the former, full confidence was entertained that it would have been\r\nratified by His Catholic Majesty with equal promptitude and a like\r\nearnest desire to terminate on the conditions of that treaty the\r\ndifferences which had so long existed between the two countries. Every\r\nview which the subject admitted of was thought to have justified this\r\nconclusion. Great losses had been sustained by citizens of the United\r\nStates from Spanish cruisers more than twenty years before, which had\r\nnot been redressed. These losses had been acknowledged and provided for\r\nby a treaty as far back as the year 1802, which, although concluded at\r\nMadrid, was not then ratified by the Government of Spain, nor since,\r\nuntil the last year, when it was suspended by the late treaty, a more\r\nsatisfactory provision to both parties, as was presumed, having been\r\nmade for them. Other differences had arisen in this long interval,\r\naffecting their highest interests, which were likewise provided for by\r\nthis last treaty. The treaty itself was formed on great consideration\r\nand a thorough knowledge of all circumstances, the subject-matter of\r\nevery article having been for years under discussion and repeated\r\nreferences having been made by the minister of Spain to his Government\r\non the points respecting which the greatest difference of opinion\r\nprevailed. It was formed by a minister duly authorized for the purpose,\r\nwho had represented his Government in the United States and been\r\nemployed in this long-protracted negotiation several years, and who, it\r\nis not denied, kept strictly within the letter of his instructions. The\r\nfaith of Spain was therefore pledged, under circumstances of peculiar\r\nforce and solemnity, for its ratification. On the part of the United\r\nStates this treaty was evidently acceded to in a spirit of conciliation\r\nand concession. The indemnity for injuries and losses so long before\r\nsustained, and now again acknowledged and provided for, was to be\r\npaid by them without becoming a charge on the treasury of Spain. For\r\nterritory ceded by Spain other territory of great value, to which our\r\nclaim was believed to be well founded, was ceded by the United States,\r\nand in a quarter more interesting to her. This cession was nevertheless\r\nreceived as the means of indemnifying our citizens in a considerable\r\nsum, the presumed amount of their losses. Other considerations of great\r\nweight urged the cession of this territory by Spain. It was surrounded\r\nby the Territories of the United States on every side except on that of\r\nthe ocean. Spain had lost her authority over it, and, falling into the\r\nhands of adventurers connected with the savages, it was made the means\r\nof unceasing annoyance and injury to our Union in many of its most\r\nessential interests. By this cession, then, Spain ceded a territory\r\nin reality of no value to her and obtained concessions of the highest\r\nimportance by the settlement of long-standing differences with the\r\nUnited States affecting their respective claims and limits, and likewise\r\nrelieved herself from the obligation of a treaty relating to it which\r\nshe had failed to fulfill, and also from the responsibility incident to\r\nthe most flagrant and pernicious abuses of her rights where she could\r\nnot support her authority.\r\n\r\nIt being known that the treaty was formed under these circumstances, not\r\na doubt was entertained that His Catholic Majesty would have ratified\r\nit without delay. I regret to have to state that this reasonable\r\nexpectation has been disappointed; that the treaty was not ratified\r\nwithin the time stipulated and has not since been ratified. As it is\r\nimportant that the nature and character of this unexpected occurrence\r\nshould be distinctly understood, I think it my duty to communicate to\r\nyou all the facts and circumstances in my possession relating to it.\r\n\r\nAnxious to prevent all future disagreement with Spain by giving the\r\nmost prompt effect to the treaty which had been thus concluded, and\r\nparticularly by the establishment of a government in Florida which\r\nshould preserve order there, the minister of the United States who\r\nhad been recently appointed to His Catholic Majesty, and to whom the\r\nratification by his Government had been committed to be exchanged for\r\nthat of Spain, was instructed to transmit the latter to the Department\r\nof State as soon as obtained, by a public ship subjected to his order\r\nfor the purpose. Unexpected delay occurring in the ratification by\r\nSpain, he requested to be informed of the cause. It was stated in\r\nreply that the great importance of the subject, and a desire to obtain\r\nexplanations on certain points which were not specified, had produced\r\nthe delay, and that an envoy would be dispatched to the United States to\r\nobtain such explanations of this Government. The minister of the United\r\nStates offered to give full explanation on any point on which it might\r\nbe desired, which proposal was declined. Having communicated this\r\nresult to the Department of State in August last, he was instructed,\r\nnotwithstanding the disappointment and surprise which it produced, to\r\ninform the Government of Spain that if the treaty should be ratified and\r\ntransmitted here at any time before the meeting of Congress it would\r\nbe received and have the same effect as if it had been ratified in due\r\ntime. This order was executed, the authorized communication was made\r\nto the Government of Spain, and by its answer, which has just been\r\nreceived, we are officially made acquainted for the first time with\r\nthe causes which have prevented the ratification of the treaty by His\r\nCatholic Majesty. It is alleged by the minister of Spain that this\r\nGovernment had attempted to alter one of the principal articles of the\r\ntreaty by a declaration which the minister of the United States had\r\nbeen ordered to present when he should deliver the ratification by his\r\nGovernment in exchange for that of Spain, and of which he gave notice,\r\nexplanatory of the sense in which that article was understood. It is\r\nfurther alleged that this Government had recently tolerated or protected\r\nan expedition from the United States against the Province of Texas,\r\nThese two imputed acts are stated as the reasons which have induced His\r\nCatholic Majesty to withhold his ratification from the treaty, to obtain\r\nexplanations respecting which it is repeated that an envoy would be\r\nforthwith dispatched to the United States. How far these allegations\r\nwill justify the conduct of the Government of Spain will appear on\r\na view of the following facts and the evidence which supports them:\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the documents transmitted herewith that the\r\ndeclaration mentioned relates to a clause in the eighth article\r\nconcerning certain grants of land recently made by His Catholic Majesty\r\nin Florida, which it was understood had conveyed all the lands which\r\ntill then had been ungranted; it was the intention of the parties to\r\nannul these latter grants, and that clause was drawn for that express\r\npurpose and for none other. The date of these grants was unknown, but it\r\nwas understood to be posterior to that inserted in the article; indeed,\r\nit must be obvious to all that if that provision in the treaty had not\r\nthe effect of annulling these grants, it would be altogether nugatory.\r\nImmediately after the treaty was concluded and ratified by this\r\nGovernment an intimation was received that these grants were of anterior\r\ndate to that fixed on by the treaty and that they would not, of course,\r\nbe affected by it. The mere possibility of such a case, so inconsistent\r\nwith the intention of the parties and the meaning of the article,\r\ninduced this Government to demand an explanation on the subject, which\r\nwas immediately granted, and which corresponds with this statement. With\r\nrespect to the other act alleged, that this Government had tolerated or\r\nprotected an expedition against Texas, it is utterly without foundation.\r\nEvery discountenance has invariably been given to any such attempt from\r\nwithin the limits of the United States, as is fully evinced by the acts\r\nof the Government and the proceedings of the courts. There being cause,\r\nhowever, to apprehend, in the course of the last summer, that some\r\nadventurers entertained views of the kind suggested, the attention of\r\nthe constituted authorities in that quarter was immediately drawn to\r\nthem, and it is known that the project, whatever it might be, has\r\nutterly failed.\r\n\r\nThese facts will, it is presumed, satisfy every impartial mind that the\r\nGovernment of Spain had no justifiable cause for declining to ratify\r\nthe treaty. A treaty concluded in conformity with instructions is\r\nobligatory, in good faith, in all its stipulations, according to the\r\ntrue intent and meaning of the parties. Each party is bound to ratify\r\nit. If either could set it aside without the consent of the other, there\r\nwould be no longer any rules applicable to such transactions between\r\nnations. By this proceeding the Government of Spain has rendered to the\r\nUnited States a new and very serious injury. It has been stated that a\r\nminister would be sent to ask certain explanations of this Government;\r\nbut if such were desired, why were they not asked within the time\r\nlimited for the ratification? Is it contemplated to open a new\r\nnegotiation respecting any of the articles or conditions of the treaty?\r\nIf that were done, to what consequences might it not lead? At what time\r\nand in what manner would a new negotiation terminate? By this proceeding\r\nSpain has formed a relation between the two countries which will justify\r\nany measures on the part of the United States which a strong sense of\r\ninjury and a proper regard for the rights and interests of the nation\r\nmay dictate.\r\n\r\nIn the course to be pursued these objects should be constantly held in\r\nview and have their due weight. Our national honor must be maintained,\r\nand a new and a distinguished proof be afforded of that regard for\r\njustice and moderation which has invariably governed the councils of\r\nthis free people. It must be obvious to all that if the United States\r\nhad been desirous of making conquests, or had been even willing to\r\naggrandize themselves in that way, they could have had no inducement\r\nto form this treaty. They would have much cause for gratulation at the\r\ncourse which has been pursued by Spain. An ample field for ambition\r\nis open before them, but such a career is not consistent with the\r\nprinciples of their Government nor the interests of the nation.\r\n\r\nFrom a full view of all circumstances, it is submitted to the\r\nconsideration of Congress whether it will not be proper for the United\r\nStates to carry the conditions of the treaty into effect in the same\r\nmanner as if it had been ratified by Spain, claiming on their part all\r\nits advantages and yielding to Spain those secured to her. By pursuing\r\nthis course we shall rest on the sacred ground of right, sanctioned in\r\nthe most solemn manner by Spain herself by a treaty which she was bound\r\nto ratify, for refusing to do which she must incur the censure of other\r\nnations, even those most friendly to her, while by confining ourselves\r\nwithin that limit we can not fail to obtain their well-merited\r\napprobation. We must have peace on a frontier where we have been so long\r\ndisturbed; our citizens must be indemnified for losses so long since\r\nsustained, and for which indemnity has been so unjustly withheld from\r\nthem. Accomplishing these great objects, we obtain all that is\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nBut His Catholic Majesty has twice declared his determination to send a\r\nminister to the United States to ask explanations on certain points and\r\nto give them respecting his delay to ratify the treaty. Shall we act by\r\ntaking the ceded territory and proceeding to execute the other\r\nconditions of the treaty before this minister arrives and is heard? This\r\nis a case which forms a strong appeal to the candor, the magnanimity,\r\nand the honor of this people. Much is due to courtesy between nations.\r\nBy a short delay we shall lose nothing, for, resting on the ground of\r\nimmutable truth and justice, we can not be diverted from our purpose.\r\nIt ought to be presumed that the explanations which may be given to the\r\nminister of Spain will be satisfactory, and produce the desired result.\r\nIn any event, the delay for the purpose mentioned, being a further\r\nmanifestation of the sincere desire to terminate in the most friendly\r\nmanner all differences with Spain, can not fail to be duly appreciated\r\nby His Catholic Majesty as well as by other powers. It is submitted,\r\ntherefore, whether it will not be proper to make the law proposed for\r\ncarrying the conditions of the treaty into effect, should it be adopted,\r\ncontingent; to suspend its operation, upon the responsibility of the\r\nExecutive, in such manner as to afford an opportunity for such friendly\r\nexplanations as may be desired during the present session of Congress.\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress a copy of the treaty and of the instructions\r\nto the minister of the United States at Madrid respecting it; of his\r\ncorrespondence with the minister of Spain, and of such other documents\r\nas may be necessary to give a full view of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the course which the Spanish Government have on this occasion thought\r\nproper to pursue it is satisfactory to know that they have not been\r\ncountenanced by any other European power. On the contrary, the opinion\r\nand wishes both of France and Great Britain have not been withheld\r\neither from the United States or from Spain, and have been unequivocal\r\nin favor of the ratification. There is also reason to believe that the\r\nsentiments of the Imperial Government of Russia have been the same, and\r\nthat they have also been made known to the cabinet of Madrid.\r\n\r\nIn the civil war existing between Spain and the Spanish Provinces in\r\nthis hemisphere the greatest care has been taken to enforce the laws\r\nintended to preserve an impartial neutrality. Our ports have continued\r\nto be equally open to both parties and on the same conditions, and our\r\ncitizens have been equally restrained from interfering in favor of\r\neither to the prejudice of the other. The progress of the war, however,\r\nhas operated manifestly in favor of the colonies. Buenos Ayres still\r\nmaintains unshaken the independence which it declared in 1816, and has\r\nenjoyed since 1810. Like success has also lately attended Chili and the\r\nProvinces north of the La Plata bordering on it, and likewise Venezuela.\r\n\r\nThis contest has from its commencement been very interesting to other\r\npowers, and to none more so than to the United States. A virtuous people\r\nmay and will confine themselves within the limit of a strict neutrality;\r\nbut it is not in their power to behold a conflict so vitally important\r\nto their neighbors without the sensibility and sympathy which naturally\r\nbelong to such a case. It has been the steady purpose of this Government\r\nto prevent that feeling leading to excess, and it is very gratifying\r\nto have it in my power to state that so strong has been the sense\r\nthroughout the whole community of what was due to the character and\r\nobligations of the nation that very few examples of a contrary kind\r\nhave occurred.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the colonies from the parent country and the great\r\nextent of their population and resources gave them advantages which it\r\nwas anticipated at a very early period would be difficult for Spain to\r\nsurmount. The steadiness, consistency, and success with which they have\r\npursued their object, as evinced more particularly by the undisturbed\r\nsovereignty which Buenos Ayres has so long enjoyed, evidently give them\r\na strong claim to the favorable consideration of other nations. These\r\nsentiments on the part of the United States have not been withheld\r\nfrom other powers, with whom it is desirable to act in concert. Should\r\nit become manifest to the world that the efforts of Spain to subdue\r\nthese Provinces will be fruitless, it may be presumed that the Spanish\r\nGovernment itself will give up the contest. In producing such a\r\ndetermination it can not be doubted that the opinion of friendly powers\r\nwho have taken no part in the controversy will have their merited\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nIt is of the highest importance to our national character and\r\nindispensable to the morality of our citizens that all violations of\r\nour neutrality should be prevented. No door should be left open for the\r\nevasion of our laws, no opportunity afforded to any who may be disposed\r\nto take advantage of it to compromit the interest or the honor of the\r\nnation. It is submitted, therefore, to the consideration of Congress\r\nwhether it may not be advisable to revise the laws with a view to this\r\ndesirable result.\r\n\r\nIt is submitted also whether it may not be proper to designate by law\r\nthe several ports or places along the coast at which only foreign ships\r\nof war and privateers may be admitted. The difficulty of sustaining the\r\nregulations of our commerce and of other important interests from abuse\r\nwithout such designation furnishes a strong motive for this measure.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the negotiation for the renewal of the commercial\r\nconvention between the United States and Great Britain a hope had been\r\nentertained that an article might have been agreed upon mutually\r\nsatisfactory to both countries, regulating upon principles of justice\r\nand reciprocity the commercial intercourse between the United States and\r\nthe British possessions as well in the West Indies as upon the continent\r\nof North America. The plenipotentiaries of the two Governments not\r\nhaving been able to come to an agreement on this important interest,\r\nthose of the United States reserved for the consideration of this\r\nGovernment the proposals which had been presented to them as the\r\nultimate offer on the part of the British Government, and which they\r\nwere not authorized to accept. On their transmission here they were\r\nexamined with due deliberation, the result of which was a new effort to\r\nmeet the views of the British Government. The minister of the United\r\nStates was instructed to make a further proposal, which has not been\r\naccepted. It was, however, declined in an amicable manner. I recommend\r\nto the consideration of Congress whether further prohibitory provisions\r\nin the laws relating to this intercourse may not be expedient. It is\r\nseen with interest that although it has not been practicable as yet\r\nto agree in any arrangement of this important branch of their commerce,\r\nsuch is the disposition of the parties that each will view any\r\nregulations which the other may make respecting it in the most friendly\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nBy the fifth article of the convention concluded on the 20th of October,\r\n1818, it was stipulated that the differences which have arisen between\r\nthe two Governments with regard to the true intent and meaning of the\r\nfifth article of the treaty of Ghent, in relation to the carrying away\r\nby British officers of slaves from the United States after the exchange\r\nof the ratifications of the treaty of peace, should be referred to\r\nthe decision of some friendly sovereign or state to be named for that\r\npurpose. The minister of the United States has been instructed to name\r\nto the British Government a foreign sovereign, the common friend to\r\nboth parties, for the decision of this question. The answer of that\r\nGovernment to the proposal when received will indicate the further\r\nmeasures to be pursued on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\nAlthough the pecuniary embarrassments which affected various parts of\r\nthe Union during the latter part of the preceding year have during the\r\npresent been considerably augmented, and still continue to exist, the\r\nreceipts into the Treasury to the 30th of September last have amounted\r\nto $19,000,000. After defraying the current expenses of the Government,\r\nincluding the interest and reimbursement of the public debt payable to\r\nthat period, amounting to $18,200,000, there remained in the Treasury on\r\nthat day more than $2,500,000, which, with the sums receivable during\r\nthe remainder of the year, will exceed the current demands upon the\r\nTreasury for the same period.\r\n\r\nThe causes which have tended to diminish the public receipts could not\r\nfail to have a corresponding effect upon the revenue which has accrued\r\nupon imposts and tonnage during the three first quarters of the present\r\nyear. It is, however, ascertained that the duties which have been secured\r\nduring that period exceed $18,000,000, and those of the whole year will\r\nprobably amount to $23,000,000.\r\n\r\nFor the probable receipts of the next year I refer you to the statements\r\nwhich will be transmitted from the Treasury, which will enable you to\r\njudge whether further provision be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe great reduction in the price of the principal articles of domestic\r\ngrowth which has occurred during the present year, and the consequent\r\nfall in the price of labor, apparently so favorable to the success of\r\ndomestic manufactures, have not shielded them against other causes\r\nadverse to their prosperity. The pecuniary embarrassments which have so\r\ndeeply affected the commercial interests of the nation have been no less\r\nadverse to our manufacturing establishments in several sections of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe great reduction of the currency which the banks have been\r\nconstrained to make in order to continue specie payments, and the\r\nvitiated character of it where such reductions have not been attempted,\r\ninstead of placing within the reach of these establishments the\r\npecuniary aid necessary to avail themselves of the advantages resulting\r\nfrom the reduction in the prices of the raw materials and of labor, have\r\ncompelled the banks to withdraw from them a portion of the capital\r\nheretofore advanced to them. That aid which has been refused by the\r\nbanks has not been obtained from other sources, owing to the loss of\r\nindividual confidence from the frequent failures which have recently\r\noccurred in some of our principal commercial cities.\r\n\r\nAn additional cause for the depression of these establishments may\r\nprobably be found in the pecuniary embarrassments which have recently\r\naffected those countries with which our commerce has been principally\r\nprosecuted. Their manufactures, for the want of a ready or profitable\r\nmarket at home, have been shipped by the manufacturers to the United\r\nStates, and in many instances sold at a price below their current value\r\nat the place of manufacture. Although this practice may from its nature\r\nbe considered temporary or contingent, it is not on that account less\r\ninjurious in its effects. Uniformity in the demand and price of an\r\narticle is highly desirable to the domestic manufacturer.\r\n\r\nIt is deemed of great importance to give encouragement to our domestic\r\nmanufacturers. In what manner the evils which have been adverted to may\r\nbe remedied, and how far it may be practicable in other respects to\r\nafford to them further encouragement, paying due regard to the other\r\ngreat interests of the nation, is submitted to the wisdom of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe survey of the coast for the establishment of fortifications is\r\nnow nearly completed, and considerable progress has been made in the\r\ncollection of materials for the construction of fortifications in the\r\nGulf of Mexico and in the Chesapeake Bay. The works on the eastern bank\r\nof the Potomac below Alexandria and on the Pea Patch, in the Delaware,\r\nare much advanced, and it is expected that the fortifications at the\r\nNarrows, in the harbor of New York, will be completed the present year.\r\nTo derive all the advantages contemplated from these fortifications it\r\nwas necessary that they should be judiciously posted, and constructed\r\nwith a view to permanence, The progress hitherto has therefore been\r\nslow; but as the difficulties in parts heretofore the least explored\r\nand known are surmounted, it will in future be more rapid. As soon as\r\nthe survey of the coast is completed, which it is expected will be done\r\nearly in the next spring, the engineers employed in it will proceed to\r\nexamine for like purposes the northern and northwestern frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe troops intended to occupy a station at the mouth of the St. Peters,\r\non the Mississippi, have established themselves there, and those who\r\nwere ordered to the mouth of the Yellow Stone, on the Missouri, have\r\nascended that river to the Council Bluff, where they will remain\r\nuntil the next spring, when they will proceed to the place of their\r\ndestination. I have the satisfaction to state that this measure has\r\nbeen executed in amity with the Indian tribes, and that it promises to\r\nproduce, in regard to them, all the advantages which were contemplated\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nMuch progress has likewise been made in the construction of ships of war\r\nand in the collection of timber and other materials for shipbuilding. It\r\nis not doubted that our Navy will soon be augmented to the number and\r\nplaced in all respects on the footing provided for by law.\r\n\r\nThe Board, consisting of engineers and naval officers, have not yet\r\nmade their final report of sites for two naval depots, as instructed\r\naccording to the resolutions of March 18 and April 20, 1818, but they\r\nhave examined the coast therein designated, and their report is expected\r\nin the next month.\r\n\r\nFor the protection of our commerce in the Mediterranean, along the\r\nsouthern Atlantic coast, in the Pacific and Indian oceans, it has been\r\nfound necessary to maintain a strong naval force, which it seems proper\r\nfor the present to continue. There is much reason to believe that if any\r\nportion of the squadron heretofore stationed in the Mediterranean should\r\nbe withdrawn our intercourse with the powers bordering on that sea would\r\nbe much interrupted, if not altogether destroyed. Such, too, has been\r\nthe growth of a spirit of piracy in the other quarters mentioned, by\r\nadventurers from every country, in abuse of the friendly flags which\r\nthey have assumed, that not to protect our commerce there would be to\r\nabandon it as a prey to their rapacity. Due attention has likewise been\r\npaid to the suppression of the slave trade, in compliance with a law of\r\nthe last session. Orders have been given to the commanders of all our\r\npublic ships to seize all vessels navigated under our flag engaged in\r\nthat trade, and to bring them in to be proceeded against in the manner\r\nprescribed by that law. It is hoped that these vigorous measures,\r\nsupported by like acts by other nations, will soon terminate a commerce\r\nso disgraceful to the civilized world.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of the duty imposed by these acts, and of a high trust\r\nconnected with it, it is with deep regret I have to state the loss which\r\nhas been sustained by the death of Commodore Perry. His gallantry in a\r\nbrilliant exploit in the late war added to the renown of his country.\r\nHis death is deplored as a national misfortune.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1819_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate a collection of the commercial\r\nregulations of the different foreign countries with which the United\r\nStates have commercial intercourse, which has been compiled in\r\ncompliance with the resolution of the Senate of 3d March, 1817.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 14, 1819_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 24th of February last, I now transmit a report of the Secretary of\r\nState, with extracts and copies of several letters, touching the causes\r\nof the imprisonment of William White, an American citizen, at Buenos\r\nAyres.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1819_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nSome doubt being entertained respecting the true intent and meaning\r\nof the act of the last session entitled \"An act in addition to the\r\nacts prohibiting the slave trade,\" as to the duties of the agents to\r\nbe appointed on the coast of Africa, I think it proper to state the\r\ninterpretation which has been given of the act and the measures adopted\r\nto carry it into effect, that Congress may, should it be deemed\r\nadvisable, amend the same before further proceeding is had under it.\r\n\r\nThe obligation to instruct the commanders of all our armed vessels to\r\nseize and bring into port all ships or vessels of the United States,\r\nwheresoever found, having on board any negro, mulatto, or person of\r\ncolor in violation of former acts for the suppression of the slave\r\ntrade, being imperative, was executed without delay. No seizures have\r\nyet been made, but as they were contemplated by the law, and might be\r\npresumed, it seemed proper to make the necessary regulations applicable\r\nto such seizures for carrying the several provisions of the act into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nIt is enjoined on the Executive to cause all negroes, mulattoes, or\r\npersons of color who may be taken under the act to be removed to Africa.\r\nIt is the obvious import of the law that none of the persons thus taken\r\nshould remain within the United States, and no place other than the\r\ncoast of Africa being designated, their removal or delivery, whether\r\ncarried from the United States or landed immediately from the vessels\r\nin which they were taken, was supposed to be confined to that coast. No\r\nsettlement or station being specified, the whole coast was thought to be\r\nleft open for the selection of a proper place at which the persons thus\r\ntaken should be delivered. The Executive is authorized to appoint one\r\nor more agents residing there to receive such persons, and $100,000 are\r\nappropriated for the general purposes of the law.\r\n\r\nOn due consideration of the several sections of the act, and of its\r\nhumane policy, it was supposed to be the intention of Congress that\r\nall the persons above described who might be taken under it and landed\r\nin Africa should be aided in their return to their former homes, or in\r\ntheir establishment at or near the place where landed. Some shelter and\r\nfood would be necessary for them there as soon as landed, let their\r\nsubsequent disposition be what it might. Should they be landed without\r\nsuch provision having been previously made, they might perish.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed, by the authority given to the Executive to appoint\r\nagents residing on that coast, that they should provide such shelter\r\nand food, and perform the other beneficent and charitable offices\r\ncontemplated by the act. The coast of Africa having been little\r\nexplored, and no persons residing there who possessed the requisite\r\nqualifications to entitle them to the trust being known to the\r\nExecutive, to none such could it be committed. It was believed that\r\ncitizens only who would go hence well instructed in the views of their\r\nGovernment and zealous to give them effect would be competent to these\r\nduties, and that it was not the intention of the law to preclude their\r\nappointment. It was obvious that the longer these persons should be\r\ndetained in the United States in the hands of the marshals the greater\r\nwould be the expense, and that for the same term would the main purpose\r\nof the law be suspended. It seemed, therefore, to be incumbent on me\r\nto make the necessary arrangements for carrying this act into effect\r\nin Africa in time to meet the delivery of any persons who might be\r\ntaken by the public vessels and landed there under it.\r\n\r\nOn this view of the policy and sanctions of the law it has been decided\r\nto send a public ship to the coast of Africa with two such agents,\r\nwho will take with them tools and other implements necessary for the\r\npurposes above mentioned. To each of these agents a small salary has\r\nbeen allowed--$1,500 to the principal and $1,200 to the other.\r\n\r\nAll our public agents on the coast of Africa receive salaries for their\r\nservices, and it was understood that none of our citizens possessing the\r\nrequisite qualifications would accept these trusts, by which they would\r\nbe confined to parts the least frequented and civilized, without\r\na reasonable compensation, Such allowance therefore seemed to be\r\nindispensable to the execution of the act. It is intended also to\r\nsubject a portion of the sum appropriated to the order of the principal\r\nagent for the special objects above stated, amounting in the whole,\r\nincluding the salaries of the agents for one year, to rather less than\r\none third of the appropriation. Special instructions will be given to\r\nthese agents, defining in precise terms their duties in regard to the\r\npersons thus delivered to them, the disbursement of the money by the\r\nprincipal agent, and his accountability for the same. They will also\r\nhave power to select the most suitable place on the coast of Africa at\r\nwhich all persons who may be taken under this act shall be delivered to\r\nthem, with an express injunction to exercise no power founded on the\r\nprinciple of colonization or other power than that of performing the\r\nbenevolent offices above recited by the permission and sanction of the\r\nexisting government under which they may establish themselves. Orders\r\nwill be given to the commander of the public ship in which they will\r\nsail to cruise along the coast to give the more complete effect to the\r\nprincipal object of the act.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1819_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of Congress of the 27th March, 1818,\r\nthe journal, acts, and proceedings of the convention which formed the\r\npresent Constitution of the United States have been published. The\r\nresolution directs that 1,000 copies should be printed, of which one\r\ncopy should be furnished to each member of the Fifteenth Congress, and\r\nthe residue to be subject to the future disposition of Congress. The\r\nnumber of copies sufficient to supply the members of the late Congress\r\nhaving been reserved for that purpose, the remainder are now deposited\r\nat the Department of State subject to the order of Congress.

In February, 1805, it was again presented by a message from\r\nthe President to the consideration of Congress, but has not since been\r\ndefinitively acted upon.\r\n\r\nThe minister resident from Denmark and the consul-general from Hamburg\r\nhaving recently renewed applications in behalf of the respective\r\nowners of the vessel and cargo, I transmit herewith copies of their\r\ncommunications for the further consideration of the Legislature, upon\r\nwhose files all the documents relating to the claim are still existing.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 31, 1819.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its advice and consent as to the\r\nratification, three treaties which have been concluded in the course of\r\nthe present year with the Kickapoos, the Chippaways, and the Kickapoos\r\nof the Vermillion by commissioners who were duly authorized for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWith the Chippaways there is a supplementary article stipulating certain\r\nadvantages in their favor on condition that the same shall be ratified\r\nby the Executive, with the advice and consent of the Senate, which I\r\nlikewise submit to your consideration.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 8, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n14th December, 1819, requesting me to cause to be laid before it any\r\ninformation I may possess respecting certain executions which have been\r\ninflicted in the Army of the United States since the year 1815 contrary\r\nto the laws and regulations provided for the government of the same,\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of War containing a detailed\r\naccount in relation to the object of the said resolution.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 8, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 20th of January,\r\n1819, requesting me \"to cause a report to be laid before them at their\r\nnext session of such facts as may be within the means of the Government\r\nto obtain shewing how far it may be expedient or not to provide by\r\nlaw for clothing the Army with articles manufactured in the United\r\nStates,\" I transmit a report from the Secretary of War, which, with\r\nthe accompanying documents, comprehends all the information required\r\nby the Senate in their resolution aforesaid.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 19, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nrequesting me \"to lay before it at as early a day as may be convenient\r\nan account of the expenditure of the several sums appropriated for\r\nbuilding fortifications from the year 1816 to the year 1819, inclusive,\r\nindicating the places at which works of defense have been begun, the\r\nmagnitude of the works contemplated at each place, their present\r\ncondition, the amount already expended, and the estimated amount\r\nrequisite for the completion of each, also the mode by which the\r\nfortifications are built, by contract or otherwise,\" I now transmit\r\nto the House a report from the Secretary of War, to whom the said\r\nresolution was referred, which, with the documents accompanying it,\r\ncontains all the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 8, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n24th January, 1820, requesting me \"to inform the House what loans, if\r\nany, have been made since the peace, to private citizens, of powder,\r\nlead, and other munitions belonging to the Government by officers of any\r\ndepartment of the Army or Navy, specifying the times, terms, objects,\r\nand extent of such loans, the names of the persons by whom and to\r\nwhom made, the different times of repayment, and also the amount of\r\nthe ultimate loss, if any, likely to be incurred by the Government in\r\nconsequence thereof,\" I now transmit a report from the Secretary of War,\r\nwhich, with the accompanying documents, contains all the information\r\nthat can be furnished on the subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 1, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n4th of February last, requesting to be informed what progress has been\r\nmade in surveying certain parts of the coast of North Carolina and in\r\nascertaining the latitude and longitude of the extreme points of Cape\r\nHatteras, Cape Look Out, and Cape Fear, according to a resolution of the\r\n19th of January, 1819, I have to state that it is intended to carry the\r\nresolution of the 19th of March into effect in the present year. The\r\ncooperation of the Board of Engineers with Naval Commissioners being\r\nnecessary in executing that duty, and the Board having been engaged\r\nlast year in surveying the eastern coast of our Union, it would have\r\ninterfered with previous arrangements and been attended with increased\r\nexpense had they been withdrawn from it. The Board will, however, be\r\nemployed during the present summer in the regular execution of its\r\nduties in the survey of the coast of North Carolina, when instructions\r\nwill be given it to afford the necessary aid to carry the resolution of\r\nthe 19th of January of the last year into effect.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 4, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, in pursuance of their resolution of the 4th of\r\nJanuary last, a report from the Secretary of State, with a list of fines\r\nincurred under the act of Congress entitled \"An act in addition to the\r\nact for the punishment of certain crimes against the United States,\"\r\nwhich appear from the records of the Department of State to have been\r\nremitted by the Executive authority of the United States.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 8, 1820_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate copies of sundry papers having relation to the\r\ntreaty of 22d February, 1819, between the United States and Spain, which\r\nhave been received at the Department of State, and have not before been\r\ncommunicated to the Senate.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 8, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a report from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nwhich, with the accompanying documents, will shew that the act of the\r\n20th May, 1812, respecting the northern and western boundaries of the\r\nState of Ohio, has been executed.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 17, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt being stipulated by the fourth article of the articles of agreement\r\nand cession entered into on the 24th of April, 1802, with the State of\r\nGeorgia that the United States should at their own expense extinguish\r\nfor the use of that State, as soon as it might be done on reasonable\r\nterms, the Indian title to all the lands within its limits, and the\r\nlegislature of Georgia being desirous to make a further acquisition of\r\nsaid lands at this time, presuming that it may be done on reasonable\r\nterms; and it being also represented that property of considerable value\r\nwhich had been taken by the Creek and Cherokee Indians from citizens of\r\nGeorgia, the restoration of which had been provided for by different\r\ntreaties, but which has never been made, it is proposed to hold a treaty\r\nwith those nations, and more particularly with the Creeks, in the course\r\nof this summer. For the attainment of these objects I submit the subject\r\nto the consideration of Congress, that a sum adequate to the expenses\r\nattending such treaty may be appropriated should Congress deem it\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 20, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 16th of February,\r\n1820, requesting me to cause to be laid before it \"abstracts of the\r\nbonds or other securities given under the laws of the United States by\r\nthe collectors of the customs, receivers of public moneys for lands, and\r\nregisters of public lands, paymasters in the Army, and pursers in the\r\nNavy, who are now in office, or who have heretofore been in office, and\r\nwhose accounts remain unsettled, together with a statement of such other\r\nfacts as may tend to shew the expediency or inexpediency of so far\r\naltering the laws respecting such officers that they may hereafter\r\nbe appointed for limited periods, subject to removal as heretofore,\"\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nwhich, with the documents accompanying it, will afford all the\r\ninformation required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 27, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress an extract of a letter from the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States at St. Petersburg, of the 1st of\r\nNovember last, on the subject of our relations with Spain, indicating\r\nthe sentiments of the Emperor of Russia respecting the nonratification\r\nby His Catholic Majesty of the treaty lately concluded between the\r\nUnited States and Spain, and the strong interest which His Imperial\r\nMajesty takes in promoting the ratification of that treaty. Of this\r\nfriendly disposition the most satisfactory assurance has been since\r\ngiven directly to this Government by the minister of Russia residing\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nI transmit also to Congress an extract of a letter from the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States at Madrid of a later date than\r\nthose heretofore communicated, by which it appears that, at the instance\r\nof the chargé d'affaires of the Emperor of Russia, a new pledge had been\r\ngiven by the Spanish Government that the minister who had been lately\r\nappointed to the United States should set out on his mission without\r\ndelay, with full power to settle all differences in a manner\r\nsatisfactory to the parties.\r\n\r\nI have further to state that the Governments of France and Great Britain\r\ncontinue to manifest the sentiments heretofore communicated respecting\r\nthe nonratification of the treaty by Spain, and to interpose their good\r\noffices to promote its ratification.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to add that the Governments of France and Russia have\r\nexpressed an earnest desire that the United States would take no steps\r\nfor the present on the principle of reprisal which might possibly tend\r\nto disturb the peace between the United States and Spain. There is good\r\ncause to presume from the delicate manner in which this sentiment has\r\nbeen conveyed that it is founded in a belief as well as a desire that\r\nour just objects may be accomplished without the hazard of such an\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\nOn full consideration of all these circumstances, I have thought it my\r\nduty to submit to Congress whether it will not be advisable to postpone\r\na decision on the questions now depending with Spain until the next\r\nsession. The distress of that nation at this juncture affords a motive\r\nfor this forbearance which can not fail to be duly appreciated. Under\r\nsuch circumstances the attention of the Spanish Government may be\r\ndiverted from its foreign concerns, and the arrival of a minister here\r\nbe longer delayed. I am the more induced to suggest this course of\r\nproceeding from a knowledge that, while we shall thereby make a just\r\nreturn to the powers whose good offices have been acknowledged, and\r\nincrease by a new and signal proof of moderation our claims on Spain,\r\nour attitude in regard to her will not be less favorable at the next\r\nsession than it is at the present.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 9, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress a correspondence which has taken place\r\nbetween the Secretary of State and the envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary of His Catholic Majesty since the message\r\nof the 27th March last, respecting the treaty which was concluded\r\nbetween the United States and Spain on the 22d February, 1819.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of His Catholic Majesty for so long a time to ratify\r\nthe treaty, it was expected that this minister would have brought with\r\nhim the ratification, or that he would have been authorized to give\r\nan order for the delivery of the territory ceded by it to the United\r\nStates. It appears, however, that the treaty is still unratified and\r\nthat the minister has no authority to surrender the territory. The\r\nobject of his mission has been to make complaints and to demand\r\nexplanations respecting an imputed system of hostility on the part of\r\ncitizens of the United States against the subjects and dominions of\r\nSpain, and an unfriendly policy in their Government, and to obtain new\r\nstipulations against these alleged injuries as the condition on which\r\nthe treaty should be ratified.\r\n\r\nUnexpected as such complaints and such a demand were under existing\r\ncircumstances, it was thought proper, without compromising the\r\nGovernment as to the course to be pursued, to meet them promptly and to\r\ngive the explanations that were desired on every subject with the utmost\r\ncandor. The result has proved what was sufficiently well known before,\r\nthat the charge of a systematic hostility being adopted and pursued by\r\ncitizens of the United States against the dominions and subjects of\r\nSpain is utterly destitute of foundation, and that their Government in\r\nall its branches has maintained with the utmost rigor that neutrality in\r\nthe civil war between Spain and the colonies which they were the first\r\nto declare. No force has been collected nor incursions made from within\r\nthe United States against the dominions of Spain, nor have any naval\r\nequipments been permitted in favor of either party against the other.\r\nTheir citizens have been warned of the obligations incident to the\r\nneutral condition of their country; their public officers have been\r\ninstructed to see that the laws were faithfully executed, and severe\r\nexamples have been made of some who violated them.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the stipulation proposed as the condition of the\r\nratification of the treaty, that the United States shall abandon the\r\nright to recognize the revolutionary colonies in South America, or to\r\nform other relations with them when in their judgment it may be just and\r\nexpedient so to do, it is manifestly so repugnant to the honor and even\r\nto the independence of the United States that it has been impossible\r\nto discuss it. In making this proposal it is perceived that His\r\nCatholic Majesty has entirely misconceived the principles on which\r\nthis Government has acted in being a party to a negotiation so long\r\nprotracted for claims so well founded and reasonable, as he likewise has\r\nthe sacrifices which the United States have made, comparatively, with\r\nSpain in the treaty to which it is proposed to annex so extraordinary\r\nand improper a condition.\r\n\r\nHad the minister of Spain offered an unqualified pledge that the treaty\r\nshould be ratified by his Sovereign on being made acquainted with the\r\nexplanations which had been given by this Government, there would have\r\nbeen a strong motive for accepting and submitting it to the Senate for\r\ntheir advice and consent, rather than to resort to other measures for\r\nredress, however justifiable and proper; but he gives no such pledge;\r\noil the contrary, he declares explicitly that the refusal of this\r\nGovernment to relinquish the right of judging and acting for itself\r\nhereafter, according to circumstances, in regard to the Spanish\r\ncolonies, a right common to all nations, has rendered it impossible for\r\nhim under his instructions to make such engagement. He thinks that his\r\nSovereign will be induced by his communications to ratify the treaty,\r\nbut still he leaves him free either to adopt that measure or to decline\r\nit. He admits that the other objections are essentially removed and will\r\nnot in themselves prevent the ratification, provided the difficulty on\r\nthe third point is surmounted. The result, therefore, is that the treaty\r\nis declared to have no obligation whatever; that its ratification is\r\nmade to depend not on the considerations which led to its adoption and\r\nthe conditions which it contains, but on a new article unconnected with\r\nit, respecting which a new negotiation must be opened, of indefinite\r\nduration and doubtful issue.\r\n\r\nUnder this view of the subject the course to be pursued would appear to\r\nbe direct and obvious if the affairs of Spain had remained in the state\r\nin which they were when this minister sailed. But it is known that an\r\nimportant change has since taken place in the Government of that country\r\nwhich can not fail to be sensibly felt in its intercourse with other\r\nnations. The minister of Spain has essentially declared his inability to\r\nact in consequence of that change. With him, however, under his present\r\npowers nothing could be done. The attitude of the United States must now\r\nbe assumed on full consideration of what is due to their rights, their\r\ninterest and honor, without regard to the powers or incidents of the\r\nlate mission. We may at pleasure occupy the territory which was intended\r\nand provided by the late treaty as an indemnity for losses so long\r\nsince sustained by our citizens; but still, nothing could be settled\r\ndefinitively without a treaty between the two nations. Is this the time\r\nto make the pressure? If the United States were governed by views of\r\nambition and aggrandizement, many strong reasons might be given in its\r\nfavor; but they have no objects of that kind to accomplish, none which\r\nare not founded in justice and which can be injured by forbearance.\r\nGreat hope is entertained that this change will promote the happiness of\r\nthe Spanish nation. The good order, moderation, and humanity which have\r\ncharacterized the movement are the best guaranties of its success.\r\n\r\nThe United States would not be justified in their own estimation should\r\nthey take any step to disturb its harmony. When the Spanish Government\r\nis completely organized on the principles of this change, as it is\r\nexpected it soon will be, there is just ground to presume that our\r\ndifferences with Spain will be speedily and satisfactorily settled.\r\n\r\nWith these remarks I submit it to the wisdom of Congress whether it will\r\nnot still be advisable to postpone any decision on this subject until\r\nthe next session.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 11, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate a report from the Secretary of State,\r\ntogether with the returns of causes depending in the courts of the\r\nUnited States, collected conformably to a resolution of the Senate of\r\nthe 18th of January, 1819.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 12, 1820_.\r\n\r\nThe SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, with the document prepared in pursuance of a resolution of the\r\nHouse of the 14th ultimo, on the subject of claims of citizens of the\r\nUnited States for Spanish spoliations upon their property and commerce.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the 3d of\r\nMarch, 1815, so much of the several acts imposing duties on the ships\r\nand vessels and on goods, wares, and merchandise imported into the\r\nUnited States as imposed a discriminating duty of tonnage between\r\nforeign vessels and vessels of the United States and between goods\r\nimported into the United States in foreign vessels and vessels of the\r\nUnited States were repealed so far as the same respected the produce\r\nor manufacture of the nation to which such foreign ship or vessel\r\nmight belong, such repeal to take effect in favor of any foreign\r\nnation whenever the President of the United States should be satisfied\r\nthat the discriminating or countervailing duties of such foreign nation\r\nso far as they operate to the disadvantage of the United States have\r\nbeen abolished; and\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory proof has been received by me from the\r\nburgo-masters and senate of the free and Hanseatic city of Lubeck that\r\nfrom and after the 30th day of October, 1819, all discriminating or\r\ncountervailing duties of the said city so far as they operated to\r\nthe disadvantage of the United States have been and are abolished:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Monroe, President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of the several\r\nacts imposing duties on the tonnage of ships and vessels and on goods,\r\nwares, and merchandise imported into the United States as imposed a\r\ndiscriminating duty of tonnage between vessels of the free and Hanseatic\r\ncity of Lubeck and vessels of the United States and between goods\r\nimported into the United States in vessels of Lubeck and vessels of\r\nthe United States are repealed so far as the same respect the produce\r\nor manufacture of the said free Hanseatic city of Lubeck.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand, at the city of Washington, this 4th day of May,\r\nA.D. 1820, and forty-fourth year of the Independence of the United\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN QUINCY ADAMS,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _November 14, 1820_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn communicating to you a just view of public affairs at the\r\ncommencement of your present labors, I do it with great satisfaction,\r\nbecause, taking all circumstances into consideration which claim\r\nattention, I see much cause to rejoice in the felicity of our situation.\r\nIn making this remark I do not wish to be understood to imply that\r\nan unvaried prosperity is to be seen in every interest of this great\r\ncommunity. In the progress of a nation inhabiting a territory of such\r\nvast extent and great variety of climate, every portion of which is\r\nengaged in foreign commerce and liable to be affected in some degree\r\nby the changes which occur in the condition and regulations of foreign\r\ncountries, it would be strange if the produce of our soil and the\r\nindustry and enterprise of our fellow-citizens received at all times\r\nand in every quarter an uniform and equal encouragement. This would be\r\nmore than we would have a right to expect under circumstances the most\r\nfavorable. Pressures on certain interests, it is admitted, have been\r\nfelt; but allowing to these their greatest extent, they detract but\r\nlittle from the force of the remarks already made. In forming a just\r\nestimate of our present situation it is proper to look at the whole in\r\nthe outline as well as in the detail. A free, virtuous, and enlightened\r\npeople know well the great principles and causes on which their\r\nhappiness depends, and even those who suffer most occasionally in their\r\ntransitory concerns find great relief under their sufferings from the\r\nblessings which they otherwise enjoy and in the consoling and animating\r\nhope which they administer. From whence do these pressures come? Not\r\nfrom a government which is founded by, administered for, and supported\r\nby the people. We trace them to the peculiar character of the epoch\r\nin which we live, and to the extraordinary occurrences which have\r\nsignalized it. The convulsions with which several of the powers of\r\nEurope have been shaken and the long and destructive wars in which\r\nall were engaged, with their sudden transition to a state of peace,\r\npresenting in the first instance unusual encouragement to our commerce\r\nand withdrawing it in the second even within its wonted limit, could not\r\nfail to be sensibly felt here. The station, too, which we had to support\r\nthrough this long conflict, compelled as we were finally to become\r\na party to it with a principal power, and to make great exertions,\r\nsuffer heavy losses, and to contract considerable debts, disturbing\r\nthe ordinary course of affairs by augmenting to a vast amount the\r\ncirculating medium, and thereby elevating at one time the price of\r\nevery article above a just standard and depressing it at another below\r\nit, had likewise its due effect.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that the pressures of which we complain have proceeded\r\nin a great measure from these causes. When, then, we take into view\r\nthe prosperous and happy condition of our country in all the great\r\ncircumstances which constitute the felicity of a nation--every\r\nindividual in the full enjoyment of all his rights, the Union blessed\r\nwith plenty and rapidly rising to greatness under a National Government\r\nwhich operates with complete effect in every part without being felt\r\nin any except by the ample protection which it affords, and under\r\nState governments which perform their equal share, according to\r\na wise distribution of power between them, in promoting the public\r\nhappiness--it is impossible to behold so gratifying, so glorious a\r\nspectacle without being penetrated with the most profound and grateful\r\nacknowledgments to the Supreme Author of All Good for such manifold and\r\ninestimable blessings. Deeply impressed with these sentiments, I can not\r\nregard the pressures to which I have adverted otherwise than in the\r\nlight of mild and instructive admonitions, warning us of dangers to\r\nbe shunned in future, teaching us lessons of economy corresponding\r\nwith the simplicity and purity of our institutions and best adapted\r\nto their support, evincing the connection and dependence which the\r\nvarious parts of our happy Union have on each other, thereby augmenting\r\ndaily our social incorporation and adding by its strong ties new strength\r\nand vigor to the political; opening a wider range, and with new\r\nencouragement, to the industry and enterprise of our fellow-citizens at\r\nhome and abroad, and more especially by the multiplied proofs which it\r\nhas accumulated of the great perfection of our most excellent system of\r\ngovernment, the powerful instrument in the hands of our All-merciful\r\nCreator in securing to us these blessings.\r\n\r\nHappy as our situation is, it does not exempt us from solicitude and\r\ncare for the future. On the contrary, as the blessings which we enjoy\r\nare great, proportionably great should be our vigilance, zeal, and\r\nactivity to preserve them. Foreign wars may again expose us to new\r\nwrongs, which would impose on us new duties for which we ought to be\r\nprepared. The state of Europe is unsettled, and how long peace may\r\nbe preserved is altogether uncertain; in addition to which we have\r\ninterests of our own to adjust which will require particular attention.\r\nA correct view of our relations with each power will enable you to form\r\na just idea of existing difficulties, and of the measures of precaution\r\nbest adapted to them.\r\n\r\nRespecting our relations with Spain nothing explicit can now be\r\ncommunicated. On the adjournment of Congress in May last the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States at Madrid was instructed to inform\r\nthe Government of Spain that if His Catholic Majesty should then ratify\r\nthe treaty this Government would accept the ratification so far as\r\nto submit to the decision of the Senate the question whether such\r\nratification should be received in exchange for that of the United\r\nStates heretofore given. By letters from the minister of the United\r\nStates to the Secretary of State it appears that a communication in\r\nconformity with his instructions had been made to the Government of\r\nSpain, and that the Cortes had the subject under consideration. The\r\nresult of the deliberations of that body, which is daily expected,\r\nwill be made known to Congress as soon as it is received. The friendly\r\nsentiment which was expressed on the part of the United States in the\r\nmessage of the 9th of May last is still entertained for Spain. Among\r\nthe causes of regret, however, which are inseparable from the delay\r\nattending this transaction it is proper to state that satisfactory\r\ninformation has been received that measures have been recently adopted\r\nby designing persons to convert certain parts of the Province of East\r\nFlorida into depots for the reception of foreign goods, from whence\r\nto smuggle them into the United States. By opening a port within the\r\nlimits of Florida, immediately on our boundary where there was no\r\nsettlement, the object could not be misunderstood. An early accommodation\r\nof differences will, it is hoped, prevent all such fraudulent and\r\npernicious practices, and place the relations of the two countries\r\non a very amicable and permanent basis.\r\n\r\nThe commercial relations between the United States and the British\r\ncolonies in the West Indies and on this continent have undergone no\r\nchange, the British Government still preferring to leave that commerce\r\nunder the restriction heretofore imposed on it on each side. It is\r\nsatisfactory to recollect that the restraints resorted to by the United\r\nStates were defensive only, intended to prevent a monopoly under British\r\nregulations in favor of Great Britain, as it likewise is to know that\r\nthe experiment is advancing in a spirit of amity between the parties.\r\n\r\nThe question depending between the United States and Great Britain\r\nrespecting the construction of the first article of the treaty of Ghent\r\nhas been referred by both Governments to the decision of the Emperor of\r\nRussia, who has accepted the umpirage.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made with the Government of France to regulate by\r\ntreaty the commerce between the two countries on the principle of\r\nreciprocity and equality. By the last communication from the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of the United States at Paris, to whom full power had\r\nbeen given, we learn that the negotiation had been commenced there; but\r\nserious difficulties having occurred, the French Government had resolved\r\nto transfer it to the United States, for which purpose the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of France had been ordered to repair to this city, and\r\nwhose arrival might soon be expected. It is hoped that this important\r\ninterest may be arranged on just conditions and in a manner equally\r\nsatisfactory to both parties. It is submitted to Congress to decide,\r\nuntil such arrangement is made, how far it may be proper, on the\r\nprinciple of the act of the last session which augmented the tonnage\r\nduty on French vessels, to adopt other measures for carrying more\r\ncompletely into effect the policy of that act.\r\n\r\nThe act referred to, which imposed new tonnage on French vessels, having\r\nbeen in force from and after the 1st day of July, it has happened that\r\nseveral vessels of that nation which had been dispatched from France\r\nbefore its existence was known have entered the ports of the United\r\nStates, and been subject to its operation, without that previous notice\r\nwhich the general spirit of our laws gives to individuals in similar\r\ncases. The object of that law having been merely to countervail the\r\ninequalities which existed to the disadvantage of the United States\r\nin their commercial intercourse with France, it is submitted also to\r\nthe consideration of Congress whether, in the spirit of amity and\r\nconciliation which it is no less the inclination than the policy of the\r\nUnited States to preserve in their intercourse with other powers, it may\r\nnot be proper to extend relief to the individuals interested in those\r\ncases by exempting from the operation of the law all those vessels which\r\nhave entered our ports without having had the means of previously\r\nknowing the existence of the additional duty.\r\n\r\nThe contest between Spain and the colonies, according to the most\r\nauthentic information, is maintained by the latter with improved\r\nsuccess. The unfortunate divisions which were known to exist some time\r\nsince at Buenos Ayres it is understood still prevail. In no part of\r\nSouth America has Spain made any impression on the colonies, while in\r\nmany parts, and particularly in Venezuela and New Grenada, the colonies\r\nhave gained strength and acquired reputation, both for the management\r\nof the war in which they have been successful and for the order of the\r\ninternal administration. The late change in the Government of Spain,\r\nby the reestablishment of the constitution of 1812, is an event which\r\npromises to be favorable to the revolution. Under the authority of the\r\nCortes the Congress of Angostura was invited to open a negotiation\r\nfor the settlement of differences between the parties, to which it\r\nwas replied that they would willingly open the negotiation provided\r\nthe acknowledgment of their independence was made its basis, but not\r\notherwise. Of further proceedings between them we are uninformed. No\r\nfacts are known to this Government to warrant the belief that any of\r\nthe powers of Europe will take part in the contest, whence it may be\r\ninferred, considering all circumstances which must have weight in\r\nproducing the result, that an adjustment will finally take place on\r\nthe basis proposed by the colonies. To promote that result by friendly\r\ncounsels with other powers, including Spain herself, has been the\r\nuniform policy of this Government.\r\n\r\nIn looking to the internal concerns of our country you will, I am\r\npersuaded, derive much satisfaction from a view of the several objects\r\nto which, in the discharge of your official duties, your attention will\r\nbe drawn. Among these none holds a more important place than the public\r\nrevenue, from the direct operation of the power by which it is raised on\r\nthe people, and by its influence in giving effect to every other power\r\nof the Government. The revenue depends on the resources of the country,\r\nand the facility by which the amount required is raised is a strong\r\nproof of the extent of the resources and of the efficiency of the\r\nGovernment. A few prominent facts will place this great interest in a\r\njust light before you. On the 30th of September, 1815, the funded and\r\nfloating debt of the United States was estimated at $119,635,558. If to\r\nthis sum be added the amount of 5 per cent stock subscribed to the Bank\r\nof the United States, the amount of Mississippi stock and of the stock\r\nwhich was issued subsequently to that date, the balances ascertained to\r\nbe due to certain States for military services and to individuals for\r\nsupplies furnished and services rendered during the late war, the public\r\ndebt may be estimated as amounting at that date, and as afterwards\r\nliquidated, to $158,713,049. On the 30th of September, 1820, it amounted\r\nto $91,993,883, having been reduced in that interval by payments\r\n$66,879,165. During this term the expenses of the Government of the\r\nUnited States were likewise defrayed in every branch of the civil,\r\nmilitary, and naval establishments; the public edifices in this city\r\nhave been rebuilt with considerable additions; extensive fortifications\r\nhave been commenced, and are in a train of execution; permanent arsenals\r\nand magazines have been erected in various parts of the Union; our Navy\r\nhas been considerably augmented, and the ordnance, munitions of war, and\r\nstores of the Army and Navy, which were much exhausted during the war,\r\nhave been replenished.\r\n\r\nBy the discharge of so large a proportion of the public debt and the\r\nexecution of such extensive and important operations in so short a\r\ntime a just estimate may be formed of the great extent of our national\r\nresources. The demonstration is the more complete and gratifying when it\r\nis recollected that the direct tax and excise were repealed soon after\r\nthe termination of the late war, and that the revenue applied to these\r\npurposes has been derived almost wholly from other sources.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury from every source to the 30th of\r\nSeptember last have amounted to $16,794,107.66, whilst the public\r\nexpenditures to the same period amounted to $16,871,534.72, leaving in\r\nthe Treasury on that day a sum estimated at $1,950,000. For the probable\r\nreceipts of the following year I refer you to the statement which will\r\nbe transmitted from the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe sum of $3,000,000 authorized to be raised by loan by an act of the\r\nlast session of Congress has been obtained upon terms advantageous to\r\nthe Government, indicating not only an increased confidence in the faith\r\nof the nation, but the existence of a large amount of capital seeking\r\nthat mode of investment at a rate of interest not exceeding 5 per cent\r\nper annum.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to add that there is now due to the Treasury for the sale\r\nof public lands $22,996,545. In bringing this subject to view I consider\r\nit my duty to submit to Congress whether it may not be advisable to\r\nextend to the purchasers of these lands, in consideration of the\r\nunfavorable change which has occurred since the sales, a reasonable\r\nindulgence. It is known that the purchases were made when the price\r\nof every article had risen to its greatest height, and that the\r\ninstallments are becoming due at a period of great depression. It\r\nis presumed that some plan may be devised by the wisdom of Congress,\r\ncompatible with the public interest, which would afford great relief\r\nto these purchasers.\r\n\r\nConsiderable progress has been made during the present season in\r\nexamining the coast and its various bays and other inlets, in the\r\ncollection of materials, and in the construction of fortifications for\r\nthe defense of the Union at several of the positions at which it has\r\nbeen decided to erect such works. At Mobile Point and Dauphin Island,\r\nand at the Rigolets, leading to Lake Pontchartrain, materials to\r\na considerable amount have been collected, and all the necessary\r\npreparations made for the commencement of the works. At Old Point\r\nComfort, at the mouth of James River, and at the Rip-Rap, on the\r\nopposite shore in the Chesapeake Bay, materials to a vast amount have\r\nbeen collected; and at the Old Point some progress has been made in the\r\nconstruction of the fortification, which is on a very extensive scale.\r\nThe work at Fort Washington, on this river, will be completed early in\r\nthe next spring, and that on the Pea Patch, in the Delaware, in the\r\ncourse of the next season. Fort Diamond, at the Narrows, in the harbor\r\nof New York, will be finished this year. The works at Boston, New York,\r\nBaltimore, Norfolk, Charleston, and Niagara have been in part repaired,\r\nand the coast of North Carolina, extending south to Cape Fear, has been\r\nexamined, as have likewise other parts of the coast eastward of Boston.\r\nGreat exertions have been made to push forward these works with the\r\nutmost dispatch possible; but when their extent is considered, with the\r\nimportant purposes for which they are intended--the defense of the whole\r\ncoast, and, in consequence, of the whole interior--and that they are to\r\nlast for ages, it will be manifest that a well-digested plan, founded on\r\nmilitary principles, connecting the whole together, combining security\r\nwith economy, could not be prepared without repeated examinations\r\nof the most exposed and difficult parts, and that it would also take\r\nconsiderable time to collect the materials at the several points where\r\nthey would be required. From all the light that has been shed on this\r\nsubject I am satisfied that every favorable anticipation which has\r\nbeen formed of this great undertaking will be verified, and that when\r\ncompleted it will afford very great if not complete protection to our\r\nAtlantic frontier in the event of another war--a protection sufficient\r\nto counterbalance in a single campaign with an enemy powerful at sea the\r\nexpense of all these works, without taking into the estimate the saving\r\nof the lives of so many of our citizens, the protection of our towns\r\nand other property, or the tendency of such works to prevent war.\r\n\r\nOur military positions have been maintained at Belle Point, on the\r\nArkansas, at Council Bluffs, on the Missouri, at St. Peters, on the\r\nMississippi, and at Green Bay, on the upper Lakes. Commodious barracks\r\nhave already been erected at most of these posts, with such works as\r\nwere necessary for their defense. Progress has also been made in opening\r\ncommunications between them and in raising supplies at each for the\r\nsupport of the troops by their own labor, particularly those most\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nWith the Indians peace has been preserved and a progress made in\r\ncarrying into effect the act of Congress making an appropriation for\r\ntheir civilization, with the prospect of favorable results. As connected\r\nequally with both these objects, our trade with those tribes is thought\r\nto merit the attention of Congress. In their original state game\r\nis their sustenance and war their occupation, and if they find no\r\nemployment from civilized powers they destroy each other. Left to\r\nthemselves their extirpation is inevitable. By a judicious regulation of\r\nour trade with them we supply their wants, administer to their comforts,\r\nand gradually, as the game retires, draw them to us. By maintaining\r\nposts far in the interior we acquire a more thorough and direct control\r\nover them, without which it is confidently believed that a complete\r\nchange in their manners can never be accomplished. By such posts, aided\r\nby a proper regulation of our trade with them and a judicious civil\r\nadministration over them, to be provided for by law, we shall, it is\r\npresumed, be enabled not only to protect our own settlements from their\r\nsavage incursions and preserve peace among the several tribes, but\r\naccomplish also the great purpose of their civilization.\r\n\r\nConsiderable progress has also been made in the construction of ships of\r\nwar, some of which have been launched in the course of the present year.\r\n\r\nOur peace with the powers on the coast of Barbary has been preserved,\r\nbut we owe it altogether to the presence of our squadron in the\r\nMediterranean. It has been found equally necessary to employ some of\r\nour vessels for the protection of our commerce in the Indian Sea, the\r\nPacific, and along the Atlantic coast. The interests which we have\r\ndepending in those quarters, which have been much improved of late, are\r\nof great extent and of high importance to the nation as well as to the\r\nparties concerned, and would undoubtedly suffer if such protection was\r\nnot extended to them.

States heretofore executed.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was submitted to the consideration of the Cortes of that\r\nKingdom before its ratification, which was finally given with their\r\nassent and sanction. The correspondence between the Spanish minister of\r\nforeign affairs and the minister of the United States at Madrid on that\r\noccasion is also herewith communicated to the Senate, together with a\r\nmemorandum by the Secretary of State of his conference with the Spanish\r\nenvoy here yesterday, when that minister gave notice of his readiness\r\nto exchange the ratifications.\r\n\r\nThe return of the original papers now transmitted, to avoid the delay\r\nnecessary to the making of copies, is requested.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 22, 1821_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 16th instant,\r\nrequesting \"the President of the United States to cause to be laid\r\nbefore the Senate the original order for building the barracks at\r\nSacketts Harbor, together with all communications between the War\r\nDepartment and Major-General Brown relative thereto, and the amount\r\nof public moneys expended thereon,\" I now transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of War, with the papers inclosed, which contains the\r\ninformation desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 22, 1821_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe treaty of amity, settlement, and limits between the United States\r\nand Spain, signed on the 22d of February, 1819, having been ratified by\r\nthe contracting parties, and the ratifications having been exchanged,\r\nit is herewith communicated to Congress, that such legislative measures\r\nmay be taken as they shall judge proper for carrying the same into\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 24, 1821_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a letter from the Secretary of War, inclosing\r\nan annual return of the militia of the United States, prepared by the\r\nAdjutant and Inspector General conformably to the militia laws on that\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1821_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to Congress certain extracts and a copy of letters\r\nreceived by the Secretary of State from the marshal of the United States\r\nfor the eastern district of Virginia, in relation to the execution of\r\nthe act of the 14th of March, 1820, to provide for taking the Fourth\r\nCensus, together with the answers returned to that marshal by the\r\nSecretary of State. As the time within which the assistants of the\r\nmarshals can legally make their returns expired on the first Monday of\r\nthe present month, it would appear by the information from the marshal\r\nat Richmond that the completion of the Fourth Census as it respects the\r\neastern district of Virginia will have been defeated not only as it\r\nregards the period contemplated by law, but during the whole of the\r\ncurrent year, unless Congress, to whom the case is submitted, should by\r\nan act of the present session allow further time for making the returns\r\nin question.\r\n\r\nAs connected with this subject, it is also submitted for the\r\nconsideration of Congress how far the marshals ought to be liable to\r\nthe payment of postage on the conveyance of the papers concerning the\r\ncensus and manufactures by the mail. In one instance it has been already\r\nascertained that this item of contingent expense will amount to nearly a\r\nmoiety of the compensation of the marshal for the whole of his services.\r\nIf the marshals are to be relieved from this charge, provision will be\r\nnecessary by law either for the admission of it in their accounts or the\r\nrefunding of it by the respective postmasters.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 2, 1821_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the two Houses of Congress copies of a treaty this\r\nday ratified on the part of the United States, concluded and signed at\r\nthe Indian Springs on the 8th of January last, with the Creek Nation of\r\nIndians, in order to such legislative measures as may be necessary for\r\ngiving effect to it.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 3, 1821_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe treaty concluded between the United States and the Kickapoo tribe\r\nof Indians on the 30th of July, 1820, having been ratified by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, I now lay a copy of the said\r\ntreaty before the House of Representatives in order to such legislative\r\nprovisions being made as may be necessary to carry into effect the\r\nstipulations therein contained on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens: I shall not attempt to describe the grateful emotions\r\nwhich the new and very distinguished proof of the confidence of my\r\nfellow-citizens, evinced by my reelection to this high trust, has\r\nexcited in my bosom. The approbation which it announces of my conduct\r\nin the preceding term affords me a consolation which I shall profoundly\r\nfeel through life. The general accord with which it has been expressed\r\nadds to the great and never-ceasing obligations which it imposes. To\r\nmerit the continuance of this good opinion, and to carry it with me into\r\nmy retirement as the solace of advancing years, will be the object of my\r\nmost zealous and unceasing efforts.\r\n\r\nHaving no pretensions to the high and commanding claims of my\r\npredecessors, whose names are so much more conspicuously identified\r\nwith our Revolution, and who contributed so preeminently to promote its\r\nsuccess, I consider myself rather as the instrument than the cause of\r\nthe union which has prevailed in the late election. In surmounting,\r\nin favor of my humble pretensions, the difficulties which so often\r\nproduce division in like occurrences, it is obvious that other powerful\r\ncauses, indicating the great strength and stability of our Union, have\r\nessentially contributed to draw you together. That these powerful causes\r\nexist, and that they are permanent, is my fixed opinion; that they may\r\nproduce a like accord in all questions touching, however remotely, the\r\nliberty, prosperity, and happiness of our country will always be the\r\nobject of my most fervent prayers to the Supreme Author of All Good.\r\n\r\nIn a government which is founded by the people, who possess exclusively\r\nthe sovereignty, it seems proper that the person who may be placed by\r\ntheir suffrages in this high trust should declare on commencing its\r\nduties the principles on which he intends to conduct the Administration.\r\nIf the person thus elected has served the preceding term, an opportunity\r\nis afforded him to review its principal occurrences and to give such\r\nfurther explanation respecting them as in his judgment may be useful\r\nto his constituents. The events of one year have influence on those\r\nof another, and, in like manner, of a preceding on the succeeding\r\nAdministration. The movements of a great nation are connected in all\r\ntheir parts. If errors have been committed they ought to be corrected;\r\nif the policy is sound it ought to be supported. It is by a thorough\r\nknowledge of the whole subject that our fellow-citizens are enabled\r\nto judge correctly of the past and to give a proper direction to the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nJust before the commencement of the last term the United States had\r\nconcluded a war with a very powerful nation on conditions equal and\r\nhonorable to both parties. The events of that war are too recent and\r\ntoo deeply impressed on the memory of all to require a development from\r\nme. Our commerce had been in a great measure driven from the sea; our\r\nAtlantic and inland frontiers were invaded in almost every part; the\r\nwaste of life along our coast and on some parts of our inland frontiers,\r\nto the defense of which our gallant and patriotic citizens were called,\r\nwas immense, in addition to which not less than $120,000,000 were added\r\nat its end to the public debt.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the war had terminated, the nation, admonished by its\r\nevents, resolved to place itself in a situation which should be better\r\ncalculated to prevent the recurrence of a like evil, and, in case it\r\nshould recur, to mitigate its calamities. With this view, after reducing\r\nour land force to the basis of a peace establishment, which has been\r\nfurther modified since, provision was made for the construction of\r\nfortifications at proper points through the whole extent of our coast\r\nand such an augmentation of our naval force as should be well adapted\r\nto both purposes. The laws making this provision were passed in 1815\r\nand 1816, and it has been since the constant effort of the Executive\r\nto carry them into effect.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of these fortifications and of an augmented naval\r\nforce in the extent contemplated, in a point of economy, has been\r\nfully illustrated by a report of the Board of Engineers and Naval\r\nCommissioners lately communicated to Congress, by which it appears that\r\nin an invasion by 20,000 men, with a correspondent naval force, in a\r\ncampaign of six months only, the whole expense of the construction of\r\nthe works would be defrayed by the difference in the sum necessary to\r\nmaintain the force which would be adequate to our defense with the aid\r\nof those works and that which would be incurred without them. The reason\r\nof this difference is obvious. If fortifications are judiciously placed\r\non our great inlets, as distant from our cities as circumstances will\r\npermit, they will form the only points of attack, and the enemy will\r\nbe detained there by a small regular force a sufficient time to enable\r\nour militia to collect and repair to that on which the attack is made.\r\nA force adequate to the enemy, collected at that single point, with\r\nsuitable preparation for such others as might be menaced, is all that\r\nwould be requisite. But if there were no fortifications, then the enemy\r\nmight go where he pleased, and, changing his position and sailing from\r\nplace to place, our force must be called out and spread in vast numbers\r\nalong the whole coast and on both sides of every bay and river as\r\nhigh up in each as it might be navigable for ships of war. By these\r\nfortifications, supported by our Navy, to which they would afford like\r\nsupport, we should present to other powers an armed front from St. Croix\r\nto the Sabine, which would protect in the event of war our whole coast\r\nand interior from invasion; and even in the wars of other powers, in\r\nwhich we were neutral, they would be found eminently useful, as, by\r\nkeeping their public ships at a distance from our cities, peace and\r\norder in them would be preserved and the Government be protected from\r\ninsult.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be remarked that these measures have not been resorted\r\nto in a spirit of hostility to other powers. Such a disposition does\r\nnot exist toward any power. Peace and good will have been, and will\r\nhereafter be, cultivated with all, and by the most faithful regard to\r\njustice. They have been dictated by a love of peace, of economy, and\r\nan earnest desire to save the lives of our fellow-citizens from that\r\ndestruction and our country from that devastation which are inseparable\r\nfrom war when it finds us unprepared for it. It is believed, and\r\nexperience, has shown, that such a preparation is the best expedient\r\nthat can be resorted to to prevent war. I add with much pleasure that\r\nconsiderable progress has already been made in these measures of\r\ndefense, and that they will be completed in a few years, considering the\r\ngreat extent and importance of the object, if the plan be zealously and\r\nsteadily persevered in.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Government in what relates to foreign powers\r\nis always an object of the highest importance to the nation. Its\r\nagriculture, commerce, manufactures, fisheries, revenue, in short, its\r\npeace, may all be affected by it. Attention is therefore due to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAt the period adverted to the powers of Europe, after having been\r\nengaged in long and destructive wars with each other, had concluded a\r\npeace, which happily still exists. Our peace with the power with whom we\r\nhad been engaged had also been concluded. The war between Spain and the\r\ncolonies in South America, which had commenced many years before, was\r\nthen the only conflict that remained unsettled. This being a contest\r\nbetween different parts of the same community, in which other powers\r\nhad not interfered, was not affected by their accommodations.\r\n\r\nThis contest was considered at an early stage by my predecessor a civil\r\nwar in which the parties were entitled to equal rights in our ports.\r\nThis decision, the first made by any power, being formed on great\r\nconsideration of the comparative strength and resources of the parties,\r\nthe length of time, and successful opposition made by the colonies, and\r\nof all other circumstances on which it ought to depend, was in strict\r\naccord with the law of nations. Congress has invariably acted on this\r\nprinciple, having made no change in our relations with either party. Our\r\nattitude has therefore been that of neutrality between them, which has\r\nbeen maintained by the Government with the strictest impartiality. No\r\naid has been afforded to either, nor has any privilege been enjoyed by\r\nthe one which has not been equally open to the other party, and every\r\nexertion has been made in its power to enforce the execution of the\r\nlaws prohibiting illegal equipments with equal rigor against both.\r\n\r\nBy this equality between the parties their public vessels have been\r\nreceived in our ports on the same footing; they have enjoyed an equal\r\nright to purchase and export arms, munitions of war, and every other\r\nsupply, the exportation of all articles whatever being permitted under\r\nlaws which were passed long before the commencement of the contest; our\r\ncitizens have traded equally with both, and their commerce with each\r\nhas been alike protected by the Government.\r\n\r\nRespecting the attitude which it may be proper for the United States to\r\nmaintain hereafter between the parties, I have no hesitation in stating\r\nit as my opinion that the neutrality heretofore observed should still\r\nbe adhered to. From the change in the Government of Spain and the\r\nnegotiation now depending, invited by the Cortes and accepted by the\r\ncolonies, it may be presumed that their differences will be settled on\r\nthe terms proposed by the colonies. Should the war be continued, the\r\nUnited States, regarding its occurrences, will always have it in their\r\npower to adopt such measures respecting it as their honor and interest\r\nmay require.\r\n\r\nShortly after the general peace a band of adventurers took advantage\r\nof this conflict and of the facility which it afforded to establish a\r\nsystem of buccaneering in the neighboring seas, to the great annoyance\r\nof the commerce of the United States, and, as was represented, of that\r\nof other powers. Of this spirit and of its injurious bearing on the\r\nUnited States strong proofs were afforded by the establishment at Amelia\r\nIsland, and the purposes to which it was made instrumental by this band\r\nin 1817, and by the occurrences which took place in other parts of\r\nFlorida in 1818, the details of which in both instances are too well\r\nknown to require to be now recited. I am satisfied had a less decisive\r\ncourse been adopted that the worst consequences would have resulted from\r\nit. We have seen that these checks, decisive as they were, were not\r\nsufficient to crush that piratical spirit. Many culprits brought within\r\nour limits have been condemned to suffer death, the punishment due to\r\nthat atrocious crime. The decisions of upright and enlightened tribunals\r\nfall equally on all whose crimes subject them, by a fair interpretation\r\nof the law, to its censure. It belongs to the Executive not to suffer\r\nthe executions under these decisions to transcend the great purpose\r\nfor which punishment is necessary. The full benefit of example being\r\nsecured, policy as well as humanity equally forbids that they should be\r\ncarried further. I have acted on this principle, pardoning those who\r\nappear to have been led astray by ignorance of the criminality of the\r\nacts they had committed, and suffering the law to take effect on those\r\nonly in whose favor no extenuating circumstances could be urged.\r\n\r\nGreat confidence is entertained that the late treaty with Spain, which\r\nhas been ratified by both the parties, and the ratifications whereof\r\nhave been exchanged, has placed the relations of the two countries on a\r\nbasis of permanent friendship. The provision made by it for such of our\r\ncitizens as have claims on Spain of the character described will, it\r\nis presumed, be very satisfactory to them, and the boundary which is\r\nestablished between the territories of the parties westward of the\r\nMississippi, heretofore in dispute, has, it is thought, been settled\r\non conditions just and advantageous to both. But to the acquisition of\r\nFlorida too much importance can not be attached. It secures to the\r\nUnited States a territory important in itself, and whose importance is\r\nmuch increased by its bearing on many of the highest interests of the\r\nUnion. It opens to several of the neighboring States a free passage to\r\nthe ocean, through the Province ceded, by several rivers, having their\r\nsources high up within their limits. It secures us against all future\r\nannoyance from powerful Indian tribes. It gives us several excellent\r\nharbors in the Gulf of Mexico for ships of war of the largest size.\r\nIt covers by its position in the Gulf the Mississippi and other great\r\nwaters within our extended limits, and thereby enables the United States\r\nto afford complete protection to the vast and very valuable productions\r\nof our whole Western country, which find a market through those streams.\r\n\r\nBy a treaty with the British Government, bearing date on the 20th of\r\nOctober, 1818, the convention regulating the commerce between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain, concluded on the 3d of July, 1815, which was\r\nabout expiring, was revived and continued for the term of ten years from\r\nthe time of its expiration. By that treaty, also, the differences which\r\nhad arisen under the treaty of Ghent respecting the right claimed by the\r\nUnited States for their citizens to take and cure fish on the coast of\r\nHis Britannic Majesty's dominions in America, with other differences on\r\nimportant interests, were adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties.\r\nNo agreement has yet been entered into respecting the commerce between\r\nthe United States and the British dominions in the West Indies and\r\non this continent. The restraints imposed on that commerce by Great\r\nBritain, and reciprocated by the United States on a principle of\r\ndefense, continue still in force.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation with France for the regulation of the commercial\r\nrelations between the two countries, which in the course of the last\r\nsummer had been commenced at Paris, has since been transferred to this\r\ncity, and will be pursued on the part of the United States in the spirit\r\nof conciliation, and with an earnest desire that it may terminate in an\r\narrangement satisfactory to both parties.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Barbary Powers are preserved in the same state\r\nand by the same means that were employed when I came into this office.\r\nAs early as 1801 it was found necessary to send a squadron into the\r\nMediterranean for the protection of our commerce, and no period has\r\nintervened, a short term excepted, when it was thought advisable to\r\nwithdraw it. The great interests which the United States have in the\r\nPacific, in commerce and in the fisheries, have also made it necessary\r\nto maintain a naval force there. In disposing of this force in both\r\ninstances the most effectual measures in our power have been taken,\r\nwithout interfering with its other duties, for the suppression of the\r\nslave trade and of piracy in the neighboring seas.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the United States in regard to their resources, the\r\nextent of their revenue, and the facility with which it is raised\r\naffords a most gratifying spectacle. The payment of nearly $67,000,000\r\nof the public debt, with the great progress made in measures of defense\r\nand in other improvements of various kinds since the late war, are\r\nconclusive proofs of this extraordinary prosperity, especially when it\r\nis recollected that these expenditures have been defrayed without a\r\nburthen on the people, the direct tax and excise having been repealed\r\nsoon after the conclusion of the late war, and the revenue applied to\r\nthese great objects having been raised in a manner not to be felt. Our\r\ngreat resources therefore remain untouched for any purpose which may\r\naffect the vital interests of the nation. For all such purposes they\r\nare inexhaustible. They are more especially to be found in the virtue,\r\npatriotism, and intelligence of our fellow-citizens, and in the devotion\r\nwith which they would yield up by any just measure of taxation all their\r\nproperty in support of the rights and honor of their country.\r\n\r\nUnder the present depression of prices, affecting all the productions\r\nof the country and every branch of industry, proceeding from causes\r\nexplained on a former occasion, the revenue has considerably diminished,\r\nthe effect of which has been to compel Congress either to abandon these\r\ngreat measures of defense or to resort to loans or internal taxes to\r\nsupply the deficiency. On the presumption that this depression and the\r\ndeficiency in the revenue arising from it would be temporary, loans\r\nwere authorized for the demands of the last and present year. Anxious\r\nto relieve my fellow-citizens in 1817 from every burthen which could\r\nbe dispensed with, and the state of the Treasury permitting it, I\r\nrecommended the repeal of the internal taxes, knowing that such relief\r\nwas then peculiarly necessary in consequence of the great exertions made\r\nin the late war. I made that recommendation under a pledge that should\r\nthe public exigencies require a recurrence to them at any time while I\r\nremained in this trust, I would with equal promptitude perform the duty\r\nwhich would then be alike incumbent on me. By the experiment now making\r\nit will be seen by the next session of Congress whether the revenue\r\nshall have been so augmented as to be adequate to all these necessary\r\npurposes. Should the deficiency still continue, and especially should it\r\nbe probable that it would be permanent, the course to be pursued appears\r\nto me to be obvious. I am satisfied that under certain circumstances\r\nloans may be resorted to with great advantage. I am equally well\r\nsatisfied, as a general rule, that the demands of the current year,\r\nespecially in time of peace, should be provided for by the revenue\r\nof that year.\r\n\r\nI have never dreaded, nor have I ever shunned, in any situation in\r\nwhich I have been placed making appeals to the virtue and patriotism\r\nof my fellow-citizens, well knowing that they could never be made in\r\nvain, especially in times of great emergency or for purposes of high\r\nnational importance. Independently of the exigency of the case, many\r\nconsiderations of great weight urge a policy having in view a provision\r\nof revenue to meet to a certain extent the demands of the nation,\r\nwithout relying altogether on the precarious resource of foreign\r\ncommerce. I am satisfied that internal duties and excises, with\r\ncorresponding imposts on foreign articles of the same kind, would,\r\nwithout imposing any serious burdens on the people, enhance the price\r\nof produce, promote our manufactures, and augment the revenue, at the\r\nsame time that they made it more secure and permanent.\r\n\r\nThe care of the Indian tribes within our limits has long been an\r\nessential part of our system, but, unfortunately, it has not been\r\nexecuted in a manner to accomplish all the objects intended by it.\r\nWe have treated them as independent nations, without their having any\r\nsubstantial pretensions to that rank. The distinction has flattered\r\ntheir pride, retarded their improvement, and in many instances paved\r\nthe way to their destruction. The progress of our settlements westward,\r\nsupported as they are by a dense population, has constantly driven them\r\nback, with almost the total sacrifice of the lands which they have been\r\ncompelled to abandon. They have claims on the magnanimity and, I may\r\nadd, on the justice of this nation which we must all feel. We should\r\nbecome their real benefactors; we should perform the office of their\r\nGreat Father, the endearing title which they emphatically give to the\r\nChief Magistrate of our Union. Their sovereignty over vast territories\r\nshould cease, in lieu of which the right of soil should be secured to\r\neach individual and his posterity in competent portions; and for the\r\nterritory thus ceded by each tribe some reasonable equivalent should\r\nbe granted, to be vested in permanent funds for the support of civil\r\ngovernment over them and for the education of their children, for their\r\ninstruction in the arts of husbandry, and to provide sustenance for\r\nthem until they could provide it for themselves. My earnest hope is that\r\nCongress will digest some plan, founded on these principles, with such\r\nimprovements as their wisdom may suggest, and carry it into effect as\r\nsoon as it may be practicable.\r\n\r\nEurope is again unsettled and the prospect of war increasing. Should the\r\nflame light up in any quarter, how far it may extend it is impossible to\r\nforesee. It is our peculiar felicity to be altogether unconnected with\r\nthe causes which produce this menacing aspect elsewhere. With every\r\npower we are in perfect amity, and it is our interest to remain so\r\nif it be practicable on just conditions. I see no reasonable cause to\r\napprehend variance with any power, unless it proceed from a violation\r\nof our maritime rights. In these contests, should they occur, and to\r\nwhatever extent they may be carried, we shall be neutral; but as a\r\nneutral power we have rights which it is our duty to maintain. For\r\nlike injuries it will be incumbent on us to seek redress in a spirit\r\nof amity, in full confidence that, injuring none, none would knowingly\r\ninjure us. For more imminent dangers we should be prepared, and\r\nit should always be recollected that such preparation adapted to\r\nthe circumstances and sanctioned by the judgment and wishes of our\r\nconstituents can not fail to have a good effect in averting dangers of\r\nevery kind. We should recollect also that the season of peace is best\r\nadapted to these preparations.\r\n\r\nIf we turn our attention, fellow-citizens, more immediately to the\r\ninternal concerns of our country, and more especially to those on which\r\nits future welfare depends, we have every reason to anticipate the\r\nhappiest results. It is now rather more than forty-four years since we\r\ndeclared our independence, and thirty-seven since it was acknowledged.\r\nThe talents and virtues which were displayed in that great struggle were\r\na sure presage of all that has since followed. A people who were able to\r\nsurmount in their infant state such great perils would be more competent\r\nas they rose into manhood to repel any which they might meet in their\r\nprogress. Their physical strength would be more adequate to foreign\r\ndanger, and the practice of self-government, aided by the light of\r\nexperience, could not fail to produce an effect equally salutary on\r\nall those questions connected with the internal organization. These\r\nfavorable anticipations have been realized.\r\n\r\nIn our whole system, national and State, we have shunned all the defects\r\nwhich unceasingly preyed on the vitals and destroyed the ancient\r\nRepublics. In them there were distinct orders, a nobility and a people,\r\nor the people governed in one assembly. Thus, in the one instance\r\nthere was a perpetual conflict between the orders in society for the\r\nascendency, in which the victory of either terminated in the overthrow\r\nof the government and the ruin of the state; in the other, in which\r\nthe people governed in a body, and whose dominions seldom exceeded the\r\ndimensions of a county in one of our States, a tumultuous and disorderly\r\nmovement permitted only a transitory existence. In this great nation\r\nthere is but one order, that of the people, whose power, by a peculiarly\r\nhappy improvement of the representative principle, is transferred from\r\nthem, without impairing in the slightest degree their sovereignty, to\r\nbodies of their own creation, and to persons elected by themselves, in\r\nthe full extent necessary for all the purposes of free, enlightened,\r\nand efficient government. The whole system is elective, the complete\r\nsovereignty being in the people, and every officer in every department\r\nderiving his authority from and being responsible to them for his\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nOur career has corresponded with this great outline. Perfection in our\r\norganization could not have been expected in the outset either in the\r\nNational or State Governments or in tracing the line between their\r\nrespective powers. But no serious conflict has arisen, nor any contest\r\nbut such as are managed by argument and by a fair appeal to the good\r\nsense of the people, and many of the defects which experience had\r\nclearly demonstrated in both Governments have been remedied. By steadily\r\npursuing this course in this spirit there is every reason to believe\r\nthat our system will soon attain the highest degree of perfection of\r\nwhich human institutions are capable, and that the movement in all its\r\nbranches will exhibit such a degree of order and harmony as to command\r\nthe admiration and respect of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nOur physical attainments have not been less eminent. Twenty-five years\r\nago the river Mississippi was shut up and our Western brethren had no\r\noutlet for their commerce. What has been the progress since that time?\r\nThe river has not only become the property of the United States from its\r\nsource to the ocean, with all its tributary streams (with the exception\r\nof the upper part of the Red River only), but Louisiana, with a fair and\r\nliberal boundary on the western side and the Floridas on the eastern,\r\nhave been ceded to us. The United States now enjoy the complete and\r\nuninterrupted sovereignty over the whole territory from St. Croix to the\r\nSabine. New States, settled from among ourselves in this and in other\r\nparts, have been admitted into our Union in equal participation in\r\nthe national sovereignty with the original States. Our population has\r\naugmented in an astonishing degree and extended in every direction.\r\nWe now, fellow-citizens, comprise within our limits the dimensions\r\nand faculties of a great power under a Government possessing all the\r\nenergies of any government ever known to the Old World, with an utter\r\nincapacity to oppress the people.\r\n\r\nEntering with these views the office which I have just solemnly sworn to\r\nexecute with fidelity and to the utmost of my ability, I derive great\r\nsatisfaction from a knowledge that I shall be assisted in the several\r\nDepartments by the very enlightened and upright citizens from whom I\r\nhave received so much aid in the preceding term. With full confidence\r\nin the continuance of that candor and generous indulgence from my\r\nfellow-citizens at large which I have heretofore experienced, and with\r\na firm reliance on the protection of Almighty God, I shall forthwith\r\ncommence the duties of the high trust to which you have called me.\r\n\r\nMARCH 5, 1821.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE

_December 3, 1821_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe progress of our affairs since the last session has been such as\r\nmay justly be claimed and expected under a Government deriving all\r\nits powers from an enlightened people, and under laws formed by their\r\nrepresentatives, on great consideration, for the sole purpose of\r\npromoting the welfare and happiness of their constituents. In the\r\nexecution of those laws and of the powers vested by the Constitution in\r\nthe Executive, unremitted attention has been paid to the great objects\r\nto which they extend. In the concerns which are exclusively internal\r\nthere is good cause to be satisfied with the result. The laws have had\r\ntheir due operation and effect. In those relating to foreign powers,\r\nI am happy to state that peace and amity are preserved with all by\r\na strict observance on both sides of the rights of each. In matters\r\ntouching our commercial intercourse, where a difference of opinion has\r\nexisted as to the conditions on which it should be placed, each party\r\nhas pursued its own policy without giving just cause of offense to the\r\nother. In this annual communication, especially when it is addressed\r\nto a new Congress, the whole scope of our political concerns naturally\r\ncomes into view, that errors, if such have been committed, may be\r\ncorrected; that defects which have become manifest may be remedied; and,\r\non the other hand, that measures which were adopted on due deliberation,\r\nand which experience has shewn are just in themselves and essential to\r\nthe public welfare, should be persevered in and supported. In performing\r\nthis necessary and very important duty I shall endeavor to place before\r\nyou on its merits every subject that is thought to be entitled to your\r\nparticular attention in as distinct and clear a light as I may be able.\r\n\r\nBy an act of the 3d of March, 1815, so much of the several acts as\r\nimposed higher duties on the tonnage of foreign vessels and on the\r\nmanufactures and productions of foreign nations when imported into the\r\nUnited States in foreign vessels than when imported in vessels of the\r\nUnited States were repealed so far as respected the manufactures and\r\nproductions of the nation to which such vessels belonged, on the\r\ncondition that the repeal should take effect only in favor of any\r\nforeign nation when the Executive should be satisfied that such\r\ndiscriminating duties to the disadvantage of the United States had\r\nlikewise been repealed by such nation. By this act a proposition was\r\nmade to all nations to place our commerce with each on a basis which it\r\nwas presumed would be acceptable to all. Every nation was allowed to\r\nbring its manufactures and productions into our ports and to take the\r\nmanufactures and productions of the United States back to their ports in\r\ntheir own vessels on the same conditions that they might be transported\r\nin vessels of the United States, and in return it was required that a\r\nlike accommodation should be granted to the vessels of the United States\r\nin the ports of other powers. The articles to be admitted or prohibited\r\non either side formed no part of the proposed arrangement. Each party\r\nwould retain the right to admit or prohibit such articles from the other\r\nas it thought proper, and on its own conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen the nature of the commerce between the United States and every\r\nother country was taken into view, it was thought that this proposition\r\nwould be considered fair, and even liberal, by every power. The exports\r\nof the United States consist generally of articles of the first\r\nnecessity and of rude materials in demand for foreign manufactories, of\r\ngreat bulk, requiring for their transportation many vessels, the return\r\nfor which in the manufactures and productions of any foreign country,\r\neven when disposed of there to advantage, may be brought in a single\r\nvessel. This observation is the more especially applicable to those\r\ncountries from which manufactures alone are imported, but it applies in\r\na great extent to the European dominions of every European power and in\r\na certain extent to all the colonies of those powers. By placing, then,\r\nthe navigation precisely on the same ground in the transportation of\r\nexports and imports between the United States and other countries it was\r\npresumed that all was offered which could be desired. It seemed to be\r\nthe only proposition which could be devised which would retain even the\r\nsemblance of equality in our favor.\r\n\r\nMany considerations of great weight gave us a right to expect that this\r\ncommerce should be extended to the colonies as well as to the European\r\ndominions of other powers. With the latter, especially with countries\r\nexclusively manufacturing, the advantage was manifestly on their side.\r\nAn indemnity for that loss was expected from a trade with the colonies,\r\nand with the greater reason as it was known that the supplies which the\r\ncolonies derived from us were of the highest importance to them, their\r\nlabor being bestowed with so much greater profit in the culture of other\r\narticles; and because, likewise, the articles of which those supplies\r\nconsisted, forming so large a proportion of the exports of the United\r\nStates, were never admitted into any of the ports of Europe except in\r\ncases of great emergency to avert a serious calamity. When no article\r\nis admitted which is not required to supply the wants of the party\r\nadmitting it, and admitted then not in favor of any particular country\r\nto the disadvantage of others, but on conditions equally applicable to\r\nall, it seems just that the articles thus admitted and invited should be\r\ncarried thither in the vessels of the country affording such supply and\r\nthat the reciprocity should be found in a corresponding accommodation\r\non the other side. By allowing each party to participate in the\r\ntransportation of such supplies on the payment of equal tonnage a strong\r\nproof was afforded of an accommodating spirit. To abandon to it the\r\ntransportation of the whole would be a sacrifice which ought not to\r\nbe expected. The demand in the present instance would be the more\r\nunreasonable in consideration of the great inequality existing in\r\nthe trade with the parent country.\r\n\r\nSuch was the basis of our system as established by the act of 1815 and\r\nsuch its true character. In the year in which this act was passed a\r\ntreaty was concluded with Great Britain, in strict conformity with\r\nits principles, in regard to her European dominions. To her colonies,\r\nhowever, in the West Indies and on this continent it was not extended,\r\nthe British Government claiming the exclusive supply of those colonies,\r\nand from our own ports, and of the productions of the colonies in return\r\nin her own vessels. To this claim the United States could not assent,\r\nand in consequence each party suspended the intercourse in the vessels\r\nof the other by a prohibition which still exists.\r\n\r\nThe same conditions were offered to France, but not accepted. Her\r\nGovernment has demanded other conditions more favorable to her\r\nnavigation, and which should also give extraordinary encouragement to\r\nher manufactures and productions in ports of the United States. To these\r\nit was thought improper to accede, and in consequence the restrictive\r\nregulations which had been adopted on her part, being countervailed\r\non the part of the United States, the direct commerce between the two\r\ncountries in the vessels of each party has been in a great measure\r\nsuspended. It is much to be regretted that, although a negotiation has\r\nbeen long pending, such is the diversity of views entertained on the\r\nvarious points which have been brought into discussion that there does\r\nnot appear to be any reasonable prospect of its early conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt is my duty to state, as a cause of very great regret, that very\r\nserious differences have occurred in this negotiation respecting the\r\nconstruction of the eighth article of the treaty of 1803, by which\r\nLouisiana was ceded to the United States, and likewise respecting the\r\nseizure of the _Apollo_, in 1820, for a violation of our revenue laws.\r\nThe claim of the Government of France has excited not less surprise than\r\nconcern, because there does not appear to be a just foundation for it in\r\neither instance. By the eighth article of the treaty referred to it is\r\nstipulated that after the expiration of twelve years, during which time\r\nit was provided by the seventh or preceding article that the vessels\r\nof France and Spain should be admitted into the ports of the ceded\r\nterritory without paying higher duties on merchandise or tonnage on the\r\nvessels than such as were paid by citizens of the United States, the\r\nships of France should forever afterwards be placed on the footing of\r\nthe most favored nation. By the obvious construction of this article it\r\nis presumed that it was intended that no favor should be granted to any\r\npower in those ports to which France should not be forthwith entitled,\r\nnor should any accommodation be allowed to another power on conditions\r\nto which she would not also be entitled on the same conditions. Under\r\nthis construction no favor or accommodation could be granted to any\r\npower to the prejudice of France. By allowing the equivalent allowed by\r\nthose powers she would always stand in those ports on the footing of the\r\nmost favored nation. But if this article should be so construed as that\r\nFrance should enjoy, of right, and without paying the equivalent, all\r\nthe advantages of such conditions as might be allowed to other powers in\r\nreturn for important concessions made by them, then the whole character\r\nof the stipulation would be changed. She would not be placed on the\r\nfooting of the most favored nation, but on a footing held by no other\r\nnation. She would enjoy all advantages allowed to them in consideration\r\nof like advantages allowed to us, free from every and any condition\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nAs little cause has the Government of France to complain of the seizure\r\nof the _Apollo_ and the removal of other vessels from the waters of\r\nthe St. Marys. It will not be denied that every nation has a right to\r\nregulate its commercial system as it thinks fit and to enforce the\r\ncollection of its revenue, provided it be done without an invasion of\r\nthe rights of other powers. The violation of its revenue laws is an\r\noffense which all nations punish, the punishment of which gives no just\r\ncause of complaint to the power to which the offenders belong, provided\r\nit be extended to all equally. In this case every circumstance which\r\noccurred indicated a fixed purpose to violate our revenue laws. Had the\r\nparty intended to have pursued a fair trade he would have entered our\r\nports and paid the duties; or had he intended to carry on a legitimate\r\ncircuitous commerce with the United States he would have entered the\r\nport of some other power, landed his goods at the custom-house according\r\nto law, and re-shipped and sent them in the vessel of such power, or\r\nof some other power which might lawfully bring them, free from such\r\nduties, to a port of the United States. But the conduct of the party\r\nin this case was altogether different. He entered the river St. Marys,\r\nthe boundary line between the United States and Florida, and took his\r\nposition on the Spanish side, on which in the whole extent of the river\r\nthere was no town, no port or custom-house, and scarcely any settlement.\r\nHis purpose, therefore, was not to sell his goods to the inhabitants of\r\nFlorida, but to citizens of the United States, in exchange for their\r\nproductions, which could not be done without a direct and palpable\r\nbreach of our laws. It is known that a regular systematic plan had been\r\nformed by certain persons for the violation of our revenue system, which\r\nmade it the more necessary to check the proceeding in its commencement.\r\n\r\nThat the unsettled bank of a river so remote from the Spanish garrisons\r\nand population could give no protection to any party in such a practice\r\nis believed to be in strict accord with the law of nations. It would\r\nnot have comported with a friendly policy in Spain herself to have\r\nestablished a custom-house there, since it could have subserved no other\r\npurpose than to elude our revenue law. But the Government of Spain did\r\nnot adopt that measure. On the contrary, it is understood that the\r\nCaptain-General of Cuba, to whom an application to that effect was made\r\nby these adventurers, had not acceded to it. The condition of those\r\nProvinces for many years before they were ceded to the United States\r\nneed not now be dwelt on. Inhabited by different tribes of Indians and\r\nan inroad for every kind of adventurer, the jurisdiction of Spain may\r\nbe said to have been almost exclusively confined to her garrisons. It\r\ncertainly could not extend to places where she had no authority. The\r\nrules, therefore, applicable to settled countries governed by laws could\r\nnot be deemed so to the deserts of Florida and to the occurrences there.\r\nIt merits attention also that the territory had then been ceded to\r\nthe United States by a treaty the ratification of which had not been\r\nrefused, and which has since been performed. Under any circumstances,\r\ntherefore, Spain became less responsible for such acts committed there,\r\nand the United States more at liberty to exercise authority to prevent\r\nso great a mischief. The conduct of this Government has in every\r\ninstance been conciliatory and friendly to France. The construction of\r\nour revenue law in its application to the cases which have formed the\r\nground of such serious complaint on her part and the order to the\r\ncollector of St. Marys, in accord with it, were given two years before\r\nthese cases occurred, and in reference to a breach which was attempted\r\nby the subjects of another power. The application, therefore, to the\r\ncases in question was inevitable. As soon as the treaty by which these\r\nProvinces were ceded to the United States was ratified, and all danger\r\nof further breach of our revenue laws ceased, an order was given for the\r\nrelease of the vessel which had been seized and for the dismission of\r\nthe libel which had been instituted against her.\r\n\r\nThe principles of this system of reciprocity, founded on the law of the\r\n3d of March, 1815, have been since carried into effect with the Kingdoms\r\nof the Netherlands, Sweden, Prussia, and with Hamburg, Bremen, Lubeck,\r\nand Oldenburg, with a provision made by subsequent laws in regard to\r\nthe Netherlands, Prussia, Hamburg, and Bremen that such produce and\r\nmanufactures as could only be, or most usually were, first shipped from\r\nthe ports of those countries, the same being imported in vessels wholly\r\nbelonging to their subjects, should be considered and admitted as their\r\nown manufactures and productions.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Norway has by an ordinance opened the ports of that\r\npart of the dominions of the King of Sweden to the vessels of the United\r\nStates upon the payment of no other or higher duties than are paid by\r\nNorwegian vessels, from whatever place arriving and with whatever\r\narticles laden. They have requested the reciprocal allowance for the\r\nvessels of Norway in the ports of the United States. As this privilege\r\nis not within the scope of the act of the 3d of March, 1815, and can\r\nonly be granted by Congress, and as it may involve the commercial\r\nrelations of the United States with other nations, the subject is\r\nsubmitted to the wisdom of Congress.\r\n\r\nI have presented thus fully to your view our commercial relations with\r\nother powers, that, seeing them in detail with each power, and knowing\r\nthe basis on which they rest, Congress may in its wisdom decide whether\r\nany change ought to be made, and, if any, in what respect. If this basis\r\nis unjust or unreasonable, surely it ought to be abandoned; but if it\r\nbe just and reasonable, and any change in it will make concessions\r\nsubversive of equality and tending in its consequences to sap the\r\nfoundations of our prosperity, then the reasons are equally strong for\r\nadhering to the ground already taken, and supporting it by such further\r\nregulations as may appear to be proper, should any additional support\r\nbe found necessary.\r\n\r\nThe question concerning the construction of the first article of the\r\ntreaty of Ghent has been, by a joint act of the representatives of\r\nthe United States and of Great Britain at the Court of St. Petersburg,\r\nsubmitted to the decision of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of\r\nRussia. The result of that submission has not yet been received. The\r\ncommissioners under the fifth article of that treaty not having been\r\nable to agree upon their decision, their reports to the two Governments,\r\naccording to the provisions of the treaty, may be expected at an early\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWith Spain the treaty of February 22, 1819, has been partly carried into\r\nexecution. Possession of East and West Florida has been given to the\r\nUnited States, but the officers charged with that service by an order\r\nfrom His Catholic Majesty, delivered by his minister to the Secretary\r\nof State, and transmitted by a special agent to the Captain-General\r\nof Cuba, to whom it was directed and in whom the government of those\r\nProvinces was vested, have not only omitted, in contravention of the\r\norder of their Sovereign, the performance of the express stipulation\r\nto deliver over the archives and documents relating to the property\r\nand sovereignty of those Provinces, all of which it was expected would\r\nhave been delivered either before or when the troops were withdrawn,\r\nbut defeated since every effort of the United States to obtain them,\r\nespecially those of the greatest importance. This omission has given\r\nrise to several incidents of a painful nature, the character of which\r\nwill be fully disclosed by the documents which will be hereafter\r\ncommunicated.\r\n\r\nIn every other circumstance the law of the 3d of March last, for\r\ncarrying into effect that treaty, has been duly attended to. For the\r\nexecution of that part which preserved in force, for the government of\r\nthe inhabitants for the term specified, all the civil, military, and\r\njudicial powers exercised by the existing government of those Provinces\r\nan adequate number of officers, as was presumed, were appointed, and\r\nordered to their respective stations. Both Provinces were formed into\r\none Territory, and a governor appointed for it; but in consideration\r\nof the pre-existing division and of the distance and difficulty of\r\ncommunication between Pensacola, the residence of the governor of West\r\nFlorida, and St. Augustine, that of the governor of East Florida,\r\nat which places the inconsiderable population of each Province was\r\nprincipally collected, two secretaries were appointed, the one to reside\r\nat Pensacola and the other at St. Augustine. Due attention was likewise\r\npaid to the execution of the laws of the United States relating to the\r\nrevenue and the slave trade, which were extended to these Provinces.\r\nThe whole Territory was divided into three collection districts, that\r\npart lying between the river St. Marys and Cape Florida forming one,\r\nthat from the Cape to the Apalachicola another, and that from the\r\nApalachicola to the Perdido the third. To these districts the usual\r\nnumber of revenue officers were appointed; and to secure the due\r\noperation of these laws one judge and a district attorney were appointed\r\nto reside at Pensacola, and likewise one judge and a district attorney\r\nto reside at St. Augustine, with a specified boundary between them;\r\nand one marshal for the whole, with authority to appoint a deputy. In\r\ncarrying this law into effect, and especially that part relating to the\r\npowers of the existing government of those Provinces, it was thought\r\nimportant, in consideration of the short term for which it was to\r\noperate and the radical change which would be made at the approaching\r\nsession of Congress, to avoid expense, to make no appointment which\r\nshould not be absolutely necessary to give effect to those powers, to\r\nwithdraw none of our citizens from their pursuits, whereby to subject\r\nthe Government to claims which could not be gratified and the parties\r\nto losses which it would be painful to witness.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen with much concern that in the performance of these\r\nduties a collision arose between the governor of the Territory and the\r\njudge appointed for the western district. It was presumed that the\r\nlaw under which this transitory government was organized, and the\r\ncommissions which were granted to the officers who were appointed to\r\nexecute each branch of the system, and to which the commissions were\r\nadapted, would have been understood in the same sense by them in which\r\nthey were understood by the Executive. Much allowance is due to officers\r\nemployed in each branch of this system, and the more so as there is good\r\ncause to believe that each acted under the conviction that he possessed\r\nthe power which he undertook to exercise. Of the officer holding the\r\nprincipal station, I think it proper to observe that he accepted it\r\nwith reluctance, in compliance with the invitation given him, and from\r\na high sense of duty to his country, being willing to contribute to the\r\nconsummation of an event which would insure complete protection to an\r\nimportant part of our Union, which had suffered much from incursion and\r\ninvasion, and to the defense of which his very gallant and patriotic\r\nservices had been so signally and usefully devoted.\r\n\r\nFrom the intrinsic difficulty of executing laws deriving their origin\r\nfrom different sources, and so essentially different in many important\r\ncircumstances, the advantage, and indeed the necessity, of establishing\r\nas soon as may be practicable a well-organized government over that\r\nTerritory on the principles of our system is apparent. This subject is\r\ntherefore recommended to the early consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with an injunction of the law of the 3d of March last,\r\nthree commissioners have also been appointed and a board organized for\r\ncarrying into effect the eleventh article of the treaty above recited,\r\nmaking provision for the payment of such of our citizens as have\r\nwell-founded claims on Spain of the character specified by that treaty.\r\nThis board has entered on its duties and made some progress therein.\r\nThe commissioner and surveyor of His Catholic Majesty, provided for by\r\nthe fourth article of the treaty, have not yet arrived in the United\r\nStates, but are soon expected. As soon as they do arrive corresponding\r\nappointments will be made and every facility be afforded for the due\r\nexecution of this service.\r\n\r\nThe Government of His Most Faithful Majesty since the termination of the\r\nlast session of Congress has been removed from Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon,\r\nwhere a revolution similar to that which had occurred in the neighboring\r\nKingdom of Spain had in like manner been sanctioned by the accepted\r\nand pledged faith of the reigning monarch. The diplomatic intercourse\r\nbetween the United States and the Portuguese dominions, interrupted\r\nby this important event, has not yet been resumed, but the change\r\nof internal administration having already materially affected the\r\ncommercial intercourse of the United States with the Portuguese\r\ndominions, the renewal of the public missions between the two countries\r\nappears to be desirable at an early day.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the colonies in South America have had great\r\nsuccess during the present year in the struggle for' their independence.\r\nThe new Government of Colombia has extended its territories and\r\nconsiderably augmented its strength, and at Buenos Ayres, where civil\r\ndissensions had for some time before prevailed, greater harmony and\r\nbetter order appear to have been established. Equal success has attended\r\ntheir efforts in the Provinces on the Pacific. It has long been manifest\r\nthat it would be impossible for Spain to reduce these colonies by force,\r\nand equally so that no conditions short of their independence would be\r\nsatisfactory to them. It may therefore be presumed, and it is earnestly\r\nhoped, that the Government of Spain, guided by enlightened and liberal\r\ncouncils, will find it to comport with its interests and due to its\r\nmagnanimity to terminate this exhausting controversy on that basis. To\r\npromote this result by friendly counsel with the Government of Spain\r\nwill be the object of the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn conducting the fiscal operations of the year it has been found\r\nnecessary to carry into full effect the act of the last session of\r\nCongress authorizing a loan of $5,000,000. This sum has been raised at\r\nan average premium of $5.59 per centum upon stock bearing an interest\r\nat the rate of 5 per cent per annum, redeemable at the option of the\r\nGovernment after the 1st day of January, 1835.\r\n\r\nThere has been issued under the provisions of this act $4,735,296.30 of\r\n5 per cent stock, and there has been or will be redeemed during the year\r\n$3,197,030.71 of Louisiana 6 per cent deferred stock and Mississippi\r\nstock. There has therefore been an actual increase of the public debt\r\ncontracted during the year of $1,538,266.69.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury from the 1st of January to the 30th of\r\nSeptember last have amounted to $16,219,197.70, which, with the balance\r\nof $1,198,461.21 in the Treasury on the former day, make the aggregate\r\nsum of $17,417,658.91. The payments from the Treasury during the same\r\nperiod have amounted to $15,655,288.47, leaving in the Treasury on the\r\nlast-mentioned day the sum of $1,762,370.44. It is estimated that the\r\nreceipts of the fourth quarter of the year will exceed the demands which\r\nwill be made on the Treasury during the same period, and that the amount\r\nin the Treasury on the 30th of September last will be increased on the\r\n1st day of January next.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the last session it was anticipated that the progressive\r\ndiminution of the public revenue in 1819 and 1820, which had been the\r\nresult of the languid state of our foreign commerce in those years,\r\nhad in the latter year reached its extreme point of depression. It\r\nhas, however, been ascertained that that point was reached only at the\r\ntermination of the first quarter of the present year. From that time\r\nuntil the 30th of September last the duties secured have exceeded those\r\nof the corresponding quarters of the last year $1,172,000, whilst the\r\namount of debentures issued during the three first quarters of this year\r\nis $952,000 less than that of the same quarters of the last year.\r\n\r\nThere are just grounds to believe that the improvement which has\r\noccurred in the revenue during the last-mentioned period will not only\r\nbe maintained, but that it will progressively increase through the next\r\nand several succeeding years, so as to realize the results which were\r\npresented upon that subject by the official reports of the Treasury at\r\nthe commencement of the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the most unfavorable circumstances the revenue\r\nfor the next and subsequent years to the year 1825 will exceed the\r\ndemands at present authorized by law.\r\n\r\nIt may fairly be presumed that under the protection given to domestic\r\nmanufactures by the existing laws we shall become at no distant period a\r\nmanufacturing country on an extensive scale. Possessing as we do the raw\r\nmaterials in such vast amount, with a capacity to augment them to an\r\nindefinite extent; raising within the country aliment of every kind to\r\nan amount far exceeding the demand for home consumption, even in the\r\nmost unfavorable years, and to be obtained always at a very moderate\r\nprice; skilled also, as our people are, in the mechanic arts and in\r\nevery improvement calculated to lessen the demand for and the price of\r\nlabor, it is manifest that their success in every branch of domestic\r\nindustry may and will be carried, under the encouragement given by the\r\npresent duties, to an extent to meet any demand which under a fair\r\ncompetition may be made upon it.\r\n\r\nA considerable increase of domestic manufactures, by diminishing the\r\nimportation of foreign, will probably tend to lessen the amount of the\r\npublic revenue. As, however, a large proportion of the revenue which is\r\nderived from duties is raised from other articles than manufactures, the\r\ndemand for which will increase with our population, it is believed that\r\na fund will still be raised from that source adequate to the greater\r\npart of the public expenditures, especially as those expenditures,\r\nshould we continue to be blessed with peace, will be diminished by the\r\ncompletion of the fortifications, dockyards, and other public works, by\r\nthe augmentation of the Navy to the point to which it is proposed to\r\ncarry it, and by the payment of the public debt, including pensions for\r\nmilitary services.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that the more complete our internal resources and\r\nthe less dependent we are on foreign powers for every national as well\r\nas domestic purpose the greater and more stable will be the public\r\nfelicity. By the increase of domestic manufactures will the demand for\r\nthe rude materials at home be increased, and thus will the dependence of\r\nthe several parts of our Union on each other and the strength of the\r\nUnion itself be proportionably augmented. In this process, which is very\r\ndesirable, and inevitable under the existing duties, the resources which\r\nobviously present themselves to supply a deficiency in the revenue,\r\nshould it occur, are the interests which may derive the principal\r\nbenefit from the change. If domestic manufactures are raised by duties\r\non foreign, the deficiency in the fund necessary for public purposes\r\nshould be supplied by duties on the former. At the last session it\r\nseemed doubtful whether the revenue derived from the present sources\r\nwould be adequate to all the great purposes of our Union, including\r\nthe construction of our fortifications, the augmentation of the Navy,\r\nand the protection of our commerce against the dangers to which it is\r\nexposed. Had the deficiency been such as to subject us to the necessity\r\neither to abandon those measures of defense or to resort to other means\r\nfor adequate funds, the course presented to the adoption of a virtuous\r\nand enlightened people appeared to be a plain one. It must be gratifying\r\nto all to know that this necessity does not exist. Nothing, however, in\r\ncontemplation of such important objects, which can be easily provided\r\nfor, should be left to hazard. It is thought that the revenue may\r\nreceive an augmentation from the existing sources, and in a manner to\r\naid our manufactures, without hastening prematurely the result which\r\nhas been suggested. It is believed that a moderate additional duty on\r\ncertain articles would have that effect, without being liable to any\r\nserious objection.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the whole coast, for the construction of permanent\r\nfortifications, from St. Croix to the Sabine, with the exception of part\r\nof the territory lately acquired, will be completed in the present year,\r\nas will be the survey of the Mississippi, under the resolution of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, from the mouth of the Ohio to the ocean, and\r\nlikewise of the Ohio from Louisville to the Mississippi. A progress\r\ncorresponding with the sums appropriated has also been made in the\r\nconstruction of these fortifications at the points designated. As they\r\nwill form a system of defense for the whole maritime frontier, and in\r\nconsequence for the interior, and are to last for ages, the greatest\r\ncare has been taken to fix the position of each work and to form it on\r\nsuch a scale as will be adequate to the purpose intended by it. All the\r\ninlets and assailable parts of our Union have been minutely examined,\r\nand positions taken with a view to the best effect, observing in every\r\ninstance a just regard for economy. Doubts, however, being entertained\r\nas to the propriety of the position and extent of the work at Dauphine\r\nIsland, further progress in it was suspended soon after the last session\r\nof Congress, and an order given to the Board of Engineers and Naval\r\nCommissioners to make a further and more minute examination of it in\r\nboth respects, and to report the result without delay.\r\n\r\nDue progress has been made in the construction of vessels of war\r\naccording to the law providing for the gradual augmentation of the Navy,\r\nand to the extent of existing appropriations. The vessels authorized by\r\nthe act of 1820 have all been completed and are now in actual service.\r\nNone of the larger ships have been or will be launched for the present,\r\nthe object being to protect all which may not be required for immediate\r\nservice from decay by suitable buildings erected over them. A squadron\r\nhas been maintained, as heretofore, in the Mediterranean, by means\r\nwhereof peace has been preserved with the Barbary Powers. This squadron\r\nhas been reduced the present year to as small a force as is compatible\r\nwith the fulfillment of the object intended by it. From past experience\r\nand the best information respecting the views of those powers it is\r\ndistinctly understood that should our squadron be withdrawn they would\r\nsoon recommence their hostilities and depredations upon our commerce.\r\nTheir fortifications have lately been rebuilt and their maritime force\r\nincreased. It has also been found necessary to maintain a naval force on\r\nthe Pacific for the protection of the very important interests of our\r\ncitizens engaged in commerce and the fisheries in that sea. Vessels have\r\nlikewise been employed in cruising along the Atlantic coast, in the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, on the coast of Africa, and in the neighboring seas. In\r\nthe latter many piracies have been committed on our commerce, and so\r\nextensive was becoming the range of those unprincipled adventurers that\r\nthere was cause to apprehend, without a timely and decisive effort\r\nto suppress them, the worst consequences would ensue. Fortunately, a\r\nconsiderable check has been given to that spirit by our cruisers, who\r\nhave succeeded in capturing and destroying several of their vessels.\r\nNevertheless, it is considered an object of high importance to continue\r\nthese cruises until the practice is entirely suppressed. Like success\r\nhas attended our efforts to suppress the slave trade. Under the flag\r\nof the United States and the sanction of their papers the trade may\r\nbe considered as entirely suppressed, and if any of our citizens are\r\nengaged in it under the flags and papers of other powers, it is only\r\nfrom a respect to the rights of those powers that these offenders are\r\nnot seized and brought home to receive the punishment which the laws\r\ninflict. If every other power should adopt the same policy and pursue\r\nthe same vigorous means for carrying it into effect, the trade could\r\nno longer exist.\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with the blessings which we enjoy, and of which we have\r\nsuch manifold proofs, my mind is irresistibly drawn to that Almighty\r\nBeing, the great source from whence they proceed and to whom our most\r\ngrateful acknowledgments are due.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 16, 1821_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a letter from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\ninclosing the report of the commissioners appointed in conformity with\r\nthe provisions of \"An act to authorize the building of light-houses\r\ntherein mentioned, and for other purposes,\" approved the 3d of March,\r\n1821.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 16, 1821_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBy a resolution of Congress approved on the 27th of March, 1818, it was\r\ndirected that the journal, acts, and proceedings of the Convention\r\nwhich formed the present Constitution of the United States should be\r\npublished, under the direction of the President of the United States,\r\ntogether with the secret journals of the acts and proceedings, and the\r\nforeign correspondence (with a certain exception), of the Congress of\r\nthe United States from the first meeting thereof down to the date of the\r\nratification of the definitive treaty of peace between Great Britain\r\nand the United States, in the year 1783, and that 1,000 copies thereof\r\nshould be printed, of which one copy should be furnished to each member\r\nof that (the Fifteenth) Congress, and the residue should remain subject\r\nto the future disposition of Congress.\r\n\r\nAnd by a resolution of Congress approved on the 21st April, 1820, it\r\nwas provided that the secret journal, together with all the papers\r\nand documents connected with that journal, and all other papers and\r\ndocuments heretofore considered confidential, of the old Congress, from\r\nthe date of the ratification of the definitive treaty of the year 1783\r\nto the formation of the present Government, which were remaining in\r\nthe office of the Secretary of State, should be published under the\r\ndirection of the President of the United States, and that I,000 copies\r\nthereof should be printed and deposited in the Library subject to the\r\ndisposition of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of these two resolutions, 1,000 copies of the journals\r\nand acts of the Convention which formed the Constitution have been\r\nheretofore printed and placed at the disposal of Congress, and 1,000\r\ncopies of the secret journals of the Congress of the Confederation,\r\ncomplete, have been printed, 250 copies of which have been reserved to\r\ncomply with the direction of furnishing one copy to each member of the\r\nFifteenth Congress; the remaining 750 copies have been deposited in the\r\nLibrary and are now at the disposal of Congress.\r\n\r\nBy the general appropriation act of 9th April, 1818, the sum of $10,000\r\nwas appropriated for defraying the expenses of printing done pursuant to\r\nthe resolution of the 27th of March of that year. No appropriation has\r\nyet been made to defray the expenses incident to the execution of the\r\nresolution of 21st April, 1820. The whole expense hitherto incurred\r\nin carrying both resolutions into effect has exceeded by $542.56 the\r\nappropriation of April, 1818. This balance remains due to the printers,\r\nand is included in the estimates of appropriation for the year 1822.\r\nThat part of the resolution of the 27th March, 1818, which directs\r\nthe publication of the foreign correspondence of the Congress of the\r\nConfederation remains yet to be executed, and a further appropriation\r\nwill be necessary for carrying it into effect.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 30, 1821.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a treaty of peace and amity concluded between\r\nthe United States and the Dey and Regency of Algiers on the 23d of\r\nDecember, 1816.\r\n\r\nThis treaty is in all respects the same in its provisions with that\r\nwhich had been concluded on the 30th of June, 1815, and was ratified, by\r\nand with the advice and consent of the Senate, on the 26th of December\r\nof that year, with the exception of one additional and explanatory\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which have occasioned the delay in laying the\r\npresent treaty before the Senate for their advice and consent to its\r\nratification are, that having been received in the spring of the year\r\n1817, during the recess of the Senate, in the interval between the time\r\nwhen the Department of State was vacated by its late Secretary and the\r\nentrance of his successor upon the duties of the office, and when a\r\nchange also occurred of the chief clerk of the Department, it was not\r\nrecollected by the officers of the Department that it remained without\r\nthe constitutional sanction of the Senate until shortly before the\r\ncommencement of the present session. The documents explanatory of the\r\nadditional articles are likewise herewith transmitted.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON _January 7, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Congress of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report of the Secretary of the Navy, together with a survey\r\nof the coast of North Carolina, made in pursuance of a resolution of\r\nCongress of the 19th January, 1819.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 8, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of a joint resolution of the two Houses of Congress of the\r\n3d of March, 1821, authorizing the President to cause such number of\r\nastronomical observations to be made by methods which might, in his\r\njudgment, be best adapted to insure a correct determination of the\r\nlongitude of the Capitol, in the city of Washington, from Greenwich or\r\nsome other known meridian in Europe, and that he cause the data, with\r\naccurate calculations on statements founded thereon, to be laid before\r\nthem at their present session, I herewith transmit to Congress the\r\nreport made by William Lambert, who was selected by me on the 10th\r\nof April last to perform the service required by that resolution.\r\n\r\nAs no compensation is authorized by law for the execution of the duties\r\nassigned to Mr. Lambert, it is submitted to the discretion of Congress\r\nto make the necessary provision for an adequate allowance to him and to\r\nthe assistant whom he employed to aid him in his observations.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 17, 1822.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI nominate the persons whose names are stated in the inclosed letter\r\nfrom the Secretary of War for the appointments therein respectively\r\nproposed for them.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the Army growing out of the act of the 2d of March, 1821,\r\n\"to reduce and fix the military peace establishment of the United\r\nStates,\" are exhibited in the Official Register for the year 1822,\r\nherewith submitted for the information of the Senate.\r\n\r\nUnder the late organization of the artillery arm, with the exception of\r\nthe colonel of the regiment of light artillery, there were no grades\r\nhigher than lieutenant-colonel recognized. Three of the four colonels of\r\nartillery provided for by the act of Congress of the 2d of March, 1821,\r\nwere considered, therefore, as original vacancies, to be filled, as the\r\ngood of the service might dictate, from the Army corps.\r\n\r\nThe Pay Department being considered as a part of the military\r\nestablishment, and, within the meaning of the above-recited act,\r\nconstituting one of the corps of the Army, the then Pay master-General\r\nwas appointed colonel of one of the regiments. A contrary construction,\r\nwhich would have limited the corps specified in the twelfth section of\r\nthe act to the line of the Army, would equally have excluded all the\r\nother branches of the staff, as well that of the Pay Department,\r\nwhich was expressly comprehended among those to be reduced. Such a\r\nconstruction did not seem to be authorized by the act, since by its\r\ngeneral terms it was inferred to have been intended to give a power\r\nof sufficient extent to make the reduction by which so many were to\r\nbe disbanded operate with as little inconvenience as possible to the\r\nparties. Acting on these views and on the recommendation of the board of\r\ngeneral officers, who were called in on account of their knowledge and\r\nexperience to aid the Executive in so delicate a service, I thought\r\nit proper to appoint Colonel Towson to one of the new regiments of\r\nartillery, it being a corps in which he had eminently distinguished\r\nhimself and acquired great knowledge and experience in the late war.\r\n\r\nIn reconciling conflicting claims provision for four officers of\r\ndistinction could only be made in grades inferior to those which they\r\nformerly held. Their names are submitted, with the nomination for the\r\nbrevet rank of the grades from which they were severally reduced.\r\n\r\nIt is proper also to observe that as it was found difficult in executing\r\nthe act to retain each officer in the corps to which he belonged, the\r\npower of transferring officers from one corps to another was reserved\r\nin the general orders, published in the Register, till the 1st day of\r\nJanuary last, in order that upon vacancies occurring those who had been\r\nput out of their proper corps might as far as possible be restored to\r\nit. Under this reservation, and in conformity to the power vested in\r\nthe Executive by the first section of the seventy-fifth article of\r\nthe general regulations of the Army, approved by Congress at the last\r\nsession, on the resignation of Lieutenant-Colonel Mitchell, of the corps\r\nof artillery, Lieutenant-Colonel Lindsay, who had belonged to this corps\r\nbefore the late reduction, was transferred back to it in the same grade.\r\nAs an additional motive to the transfer, it had the effect of preventing\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Taylor and Major Woolley being reduced to lower\r\ngrades than those which they held before the reduction, and Captain Cobb\r\nfrom being disbanded under the act. These circumstances were considered\r\nas constituting an extraordinary case within the meaning of the section\r\nalready referred to of the Regulations of the Army. It is, however,\r\nsubmitted to the Senate whether this is a case requiring their\r\nconfirmation; and in case that such should be their opinion, it is\r\nsubmitted to them for their constitutional confirmation.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 20, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives\r\n\"requesting the President of the United States to cause to be laid\r\nbefore this House an account of the expenditures made under the act to\r\nprovide for the civilization of the Indian tribes, specifying the times\r\nwhen, the persons to whom, and the particular purpose for which such\r\nexpenditures have been made,\" I herewith transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 28, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the 2d instant, I transmit a report\r\nof the Secretary of State, with all the documents relating to the\r\nmisunderstanding between Andrew Jackson, while acting as governor of\r\nthe Floridas, and Eligius Fromentin, judge of a court therein; and also\r\nof the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the minister\r\nplenipotentiary of His Catholic Majesty on certain proceedings in that\r\nTerritory in execution of the powers vested in the governor by the\r\nExecutive under the law of the last session for carrying into effect the\r\nlate treaty between the United States and Spain.

our\r\nGovernment in cases submitted to my discretion, as in the present\r\ninstance, to hazard error by the freedom of the communication rather\r\nthan by withholding any portion of information belonging to the subject,\r\nI have thought proper to communicate every document comprised within\r\nthis call.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 30, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House

MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 25, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nUnder the appropriation made by the act of Congress of the 11th of\r\nApril, 1820, for holding treaties with the Creek and Cherokee nations of\r\nIndians for the extinguishment of the Indian title to lands within the\r\nState of Georgia, pursuant to the fourth condition of the first article\r\nof the articles of agreement and cession concluded between the United\r\nStates and the State of Georgia on the 24th day of April, 1802, a treaty\r\nwas held with the Creek Nation, the expense of which upon the settlement\r\nof the accounts of the commissioners who were appointed to conduct the\r\nnegotiation was ascertained to amount to the sum of $24,695, leaving an\r\nunexpended balance of the sum appropriated of $5,305, a sum too small\r\nto negotiate a treaty with the Cherokees, as was contemplated by the\r\nact making the appropriation. The legislature of Georgia being still\r\ndesirous that a treaty should be held for further extinguishment of the\r\nIndian title to lands within that State, and to obtain an indemnity to\r\nthe citizens of that State for property of considerable value, which has\r\nbeen taken from them by the Cherokee Indians, I submit the subject to\r\nthe consideration of Congress, that a further sum, which, in addition\r\nto the balance of the former appropriation, will be adequate to the\r\nexpenses attending a treaty with them, may be appropriated should\r\nCongress deem it expedient.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 4, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n22d ultimo, requesting the President of the United States \"to cause to\r\nbe laid before this House a statement showing the amount of woolens\r\npurchased for the use of the Army during the years 1820 and 1821,\r\ncomprising a description of the articles, of whom the purchases were\r\nmade, at what prices, and what proportion thereof was of American\r\nmanufacture,\" I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 8, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn transmitting to the House of Representatives the documents called for\r\nby the resolution of that House of the 30th January, I consider it my\r\nduty to invite the attention of Congress to a very important subject,\r\nand to communicate the sentiments of the Executive on it, that, should\r\nCongress entertain similar sentiments, there may be such cooperation\r\nbetween the two departments of the Government as their respective rights\r\nand duties may require.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary movement in the Spanish Provinces in this hemisphere\r\nattracted the attention and excited the sympathy of our fellow-citizens\r\nfrom its commencement. This feeling was natural and honorable to\r\nthem, from causes which need not be communicated to you. It has been\r\ngratifying to all to see the general acquiescence which has been\r\nmanifested in the policy which the constituted authorities have deemed\r\nit proper to pursue in regard to this contest. As soon as the movement\r\nassumed such a steady and consistent form as to make the success of the\r\nProvinces probable, the rights to which they were entitled by the law\r\nof nations as equal parties to a civil war were extended to them. Each\r\nparty was permitted to enter our ports with its public and private\r\nships, and to take from them every article which was the subject of\r\ncommerce with other nations. Our citizens, also, have carried on\r\ncommerce with both parties, and the Government has protected it with\r\neach in articles not contraband of war. Through the whole of this\r\ncontest the United States have remained neutral, and have fulfilled with\r\nthe utmost impartiality all the obligations incident to that character.\r\n\r\nThis contest has now reached such a stage and been attended with such\r\ndecisive success on the part of the Provinces that it merits the most\r\nprofound consideration whether their right to the rank of independent\r\nnations, with all the advantages incident to it in their intercourse\r\nwith the United States, is not complete. Buenos Ayres assumed that rank\r\nby a formal declaration in 1816, and has enjoyed it since 1810 free from\r\ninvasion by the parent country. The Provinces composing the Republic\r\nof Colombia, after having separately declared their independence, were\r\nunited by a fundamental law of the 17th of December, 1819. A strong\r\nSpanish force occupied at that time certain parts of the territory\r\nwithin their limits and waged a destructive war. That force has since\r\nbeen repeatedly defeated, and the whole of it either made prisoners\r\nor destroyed or expelled from the country, with the exception of an\r\ninconsiderable portion only, which is blockaded in two fortresses.\r\nThe Provinces on the Pacific have likewise been very successful. Chili\r\ndeclared independence in 1818, and has since enjoyed it undisturbed; and\r\nof late, by the assistance of Chili and Buenos Ayres, the revolution\r\nhas extended to Peru. Of the movement in Mexico our information is less\r\nauthentic, but it is, nevertheless, distinctly understood that the new\r\nGovernment has declared its independence, and that there is now no\r\nopposition to it there nor a force to make any. For the last three years\r\nthe Government of Spain has not sent a single corps of troops to any\r\npart of that country, nor is there any reason to believe it will send\r\nany in future. Thus it is manifest that all those Provinces are not only\r\nin the full enjoyment of their independence, but, considering the state\r\nof the war and other circumstances, that there is not the most remote\r\nprospect of their being deprived of it.\r\n\r\nWhen the result of such a contest is manifestly settled, the new\r\ngovernments have a claim to recognition by other powers which ought not\r\nto be resisted. Civil wars too often excite feelings which the parties\r\ncan not control. The opinion entertained by other powers as to the\r\nresult may assuage those feelings and promote an accommodation between\r\nthem useful and honorable to both. The delay which has been observed in\r\nmaking a decision on this important subject will, it is presumed, have\r\nafforded an unequivocal proof to Spain, as it must have done to other\r\npowers, of the high respect entertained by the United States for her\r\nrights and of their determination not to interfere with them. The\r\nProvinces belonging to this hemisphere are our neighbors, and have\r\nsuccessively, as each portion of the country acquired its independence,\r\npressed their recognition by an appeal to facts not to be contested, and\r\nwhich they thought gave them a just title to it. To motives of interest\r\nthis Government has invariably disclaimed all pretension, being resolved\r\nto take no part in the controversy or other measure in regard to it\r\nwhich should not merit the sanction of the civilized world. To other\r\nclaims a just sensibility has been always felt and frankly acknowledged,\r\nbut they in themselves could never become an adequate cause of action.\r\nIt was incumbent on this Government to look to every important fact and\r\ncircumstance on which a sound opinion could be formed, which has been\r\ndone. When we regard, then, the great length of time which this war has\r\nbeen prosecuted, the complete success which has attended it in favor\r\nof the Provinces, the present condition of the parties, and the utter\r\ninability of Spain to produce any change in it, we are compelled to\r\nconclude that its fate is settled, and that the Provinces which have\r\ndeclared their independence and are in the enjoyment of it ought to\r\nbe recognized.\r\n\r\nOf the views of the Spanish Government on this subject no particular\r\ninformation has been recently received. It may be presumed that the\r\nsuccessful progress of the revolution through such a long series of\r\nyears, gaining strength and extending annually in every direction, and\r\nembracing by the late important events, with little exception, all the\r\ndominions of Spain south of the United States on this continent, placing\r\nthereby the complete sovereignty over the whole in the hands of the\r\npeople, will reconcile the parent country to an accommodation with them\r\non the basis of their unqualified independence. Nor has any authentic\r\ninformation been recently received of the disposition of other powers\r\nrespecting it. A sincere desire has been cherished to act in concert\r\nwith them in the proposed recognition, of which several were some time\r\npast duly apprised; but it was understood that they were not prepared\r\nfor it. The immense space between those powers, even those which border\r\non the Atlantic, and these Provinces makes the movement an affair\r\nof less interest and excitement to them than to us. It is probable,\r\ntherefore, that they have been less attentive to its progress than we\r\nhave been. It may be presumed, however, that the late events will dispel\r\nall doubt of the result.\r\n\r\nIn proposing this measure it is not contemplated to change thereby in\r\nthe slightest manner our friendly relations with either of the parties,\r\nbut to observe in all respects, as heretofore, should the war be\r\ncontinued, the most perfect neutrality between them. Of this friendly\r\ndisposition an assurance will be given to the Government of Spain,\r\nto whom it is presumed it will be, as it ought to be, satisfactory.\r\nThe measure is proposed under a thorough conviction that it is in\r\nstrict accord with the law of nations, that it is just and right as\r\nto the parties, and that the United States owe it to their station\r\nand character in the world, as well as to their essential interests,\r\nto adopt it. Should Congress concur in the view herein presented, they\r\nwill doubtless see the propriety of making the necessary appropriations\r\nfor carrying it into effect.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 9, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of War, together with the annual\r\nreturn of the militia of the United States, and an exhibit of the arms,\r\naccouterments, and ammunition of the several States and Territories of\r\nthe United States, prepared in conformity with the militia laws on that\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 12, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI lay before the Senate the copy of a supplementary report, made by\r\nWilliam Lambert, in relation to the longitude of the Capitol from\r\nGreenwich, in pursuance of a joint resolution of the two Houses of\r\nCongress of the 3d of March, 1821, and I subjoin an extract from the\r\nletter of Mr. Lambert submitting that report.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 26, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nCongress having suspended the appropriation, at the last session,\r\nfor the fortification at Dauphine Island, in consequence of a doubt\r\nwhich was entertained of the propriety of that position, the further\r\nprosecution of the work was suspended, and an order given, as intimated\r\nin the message of the 3d of December, to the Board of Engineers and\r\nNaval Commissioners to examine that part of the coast, and particularly\r\nthat position, as also the position at Mobile Point, with which it is\r\nconnected, and to report their opinion thereon, which has been done,\r\nand which report is herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nBy this report it appears to be still the opinion of the Board that the\r\nconstruction of works at both these positions is of great importance to\r\nthe defense of New Orleans and of all that portion of our Union which is\r\nconnected with and dependent on the Mississippi and on the other waters\r\nwhich empty into the Gulf of Mexico between that river and Cape Florida.\r\nThat the subject may be fully before Congress, I transmit also a copy\r\nof the former report of the Board, being that on which the work was\r\nundertaken and has been in part executed. Approving as I do the opinion\r\nof the Board, I consider it my duty to state the reasons on which I\r\nadopted the first report, especially as they were in part suggested by\r\nthe occurrences of the late war.\r\n\r\nThe policy which induced Congress to decide on and provide for the\r\ndefense of the coast immediately after the war was founded on the marked\r\nevents of that interesting epoch. The vast body of men which it was\r\nfound necessary to call into the field through the whole extent of our\r\nmaritime frontier, and the number who perished by exposure, with the\r\nimmense expenditure of money and waste of property which followed, were\r\nto be traced in an eminent degree to the defenseless condition of the\r\ncoast. It was to mitigate these evils in future wars, and even for the\r\nhigher purpose of preventing war itself, that the decision was formed to\r\nmake the coast, so far as it might be practicable, impregnable, and that\r\nthe measures necessary to that great object have been pursued with so\r\nmuch zeal since.\r\n\r\nIt is known that no part of our Union is more exposed to invasion by the\r\nnumerous avenues leading to it, or more defenseless by the thinness of\r\nthe neighboring population, or offers a greater temptation to invasion,\r\neither as a permanent acquisition or as a prize to the cupidity of\r\ngrasping invaders from the immense amount of produce deposited there,\r\nthan the city of New Orleans. It is known also that the seizure of no\r\npart of our Union could affect so deeply and vitally the immediate\r\ninterests of so many States and of so many of our fellow-citizens,\r\ncomprising all that extensive territory and numerous population which\r\nare connected with and dependent on the Mississippi, as the seizure of\r\nthat city. Strong works, well posted, were therefore deemed absolutely\r\nnecessary for its protection.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, by the Mississippi only, or the waters which\r\ncommunicate directly with or approach nearest to New Orleans, that the\r\ntown is assailable. It will be recollected that in the late war the\r\npublic solicitude was excited not so much by the danger which menaced it\r\nin those directions as by the apprehension that, while a feint might be\r\nmade there, the main force, landing either in the bay of Mobile or other\r\nwaters between that bay and the Rigolets, would be thrown above the town\r\nin the rear of the army which had been collected there for its defense.\r\nFull confidence was entertained that that gallant army, led by the\r\ngallant and able chief who commanded it, would repel any attack to which\r\nit might be exposed in front. But had such a force been thrown above the\r\ntown, and a position taken on the banks of the river, the disadvantage\r\nto which our troops would have been subjected, attacked in front and\r\nrear as they might have been, may easily be conceived. As their supplies\r\nwould have been cut off, they could not long have remained in the city,\r\nand, withdrawing from it, it must have fallen immediately into the hands\r\nof the force below. In ascending the river to attack the force above,\r\nthe attack must have been made to great disadvantage, since it must have\r\nbeen on such ground and at such time as the enemy preferred. These\r\nconsiderations shew that defenses other than such as are immediately\r\nconnected with the city are of great importance to its safety.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to seize New Orleans and the lower part of the Mississippi\r\nwill be made only by a great power or a combination of several powers,\r\nwith a strong naval and land force, the latter of which must be brought\r\nin transports which may sail in shallow water. If the defenses around\r\nNew Orleans are well posted and of sufficient strength to repel any\r\nattack which may be made on them, the city can be assailed only by a\r\nland force, which must pass in the direction above suggested, between\r\nthe Rigolets and the bay of Mobile. It becomes, therefore, an object of\r\nhigh importance to present such an obstacle to such an attempt as would\r\ndefeat it should it be made. Fortifications are useful for the defense\r\nof posts, to prevent the approach to cities and the passage of rivers;\r\nbut as works their effect can not be felt beyond the reach of their\r\ncannon. They are formidable in other respects by the body of men\r\nwithin them, which may be removed and applied to other purposes.\r\n\r\nBetween the Rigolets and the bay of Mobile there is a chain of islands,\r\nat the extremity of which is Dauphine Island, which forms, with Mobile\r\nPoint, from which it is distant about 3-1/4 miles, the entrance into the\r\nbay of Mobile, which leads through that part of the State of Alabama to\r\nthe towns of Mobile and Blakeley. The distance between Dauphine Island\r\nand the Rigolets is 90 miles. The principal islands between them are\r\nMassacre, Horn, Ship, and Cat islands, near to which there is anchorage\r\nfor large ships of war. The first object is to prevent the landing of\r\nany force for the purposes above stated between the Rigolets and the bay\r\nof Mobile; the second, to defeat that force in case it should be landed.\r\nWhen the distance from one point to the other is considered, it is\r\nbelieved that it would be impossible to establish works so near to each\r\nother as to prevent the landing of such a force. Its defeat, therefore,\r\nshould be effectually provided for. If the arrangement should be such as\r\nto make that result evident, it ought to be fairly concluded that the\r\nattempt would not be made, and thus we should accomplish in the best\r\nmode possible and with the least expense the complete security of this\r\nimportant part of our Union, the great object of our system of defense\r\nfor the whole.\r\n\r\nThere are some other views of this subject which it is thought will\r\nmerit particular attention in deciding the point in question. Not being\r\nable to establish a chain of posts, at least for the present, along the\r\nwhole coast from the Rigolets to Dauphine Island, or on all the islands\r\nbetween them, at which point shall we begin? Should an attack on the\r\ncity be anticipated, it can not be doubted that an adequate force would\r\nimmediately be ordered there for its defense. If the enemy should\r\ndespair of making an impression on the works near the town, it may be\r\npresumed that they would promptly decide to make the attempt in the\r\nmanner and in the line above suggested between the Rigolets and the\r\nbay of Mobile. It will be obvious that the nearer the fortification is\r\nerected to the Rigolets with a view to this object, should it be on Cat\r\nor Ship Island, for example, the wider would the passage be left open\r\nbetween that work and the bay of Mobile for such an enterprise. The main\r\narmy, being drawn to New Orleans, would be ready to meet such an attempt\r\nnear the Rigolets or at any other point not distant from the city. It\r\nis probable, therefore, that the enemy, profiting of a fair wind, would\r\nmake his attempt at the greatest distance compatible with his object\r\nfrom that point, and at the bay of Mobile should there not be works\r\nthere of sufficient strength to prevent it. Should, however, strong\r\nworks be erected there, such as were sufficient not only for their own\r\ndefense against any attack which might be made on them, but to hold a\r\nforce connected with that which might be drawn from the neighboring\r\ncountry, capable of cooperating with the force at the city, and which\r\nwould doubtless be ordered to those works in the event of war, it\r\nwould be dangerous for the invading force to land anywhere between the\r\nRigolets and the bay of Mobile and to pass toward the Mississippi above\r\nthe city, lest such a body might be thrown in its rear as to cut off its\r\nretreat. These considerations show the great advantage of establishing\r\nat the mouth of the bay of Mobile very strong works, such as would be\r\nadequate to all the purposes suggested.\r\n\r\nIf fortifications were necessary only to protect our country and cities\r\nagainst the entry of large ships of war into our bays and rivers, they\r\nwould be of little use for the defense of New Orleans, since that city\r\ncan not be approached so near, either by the Mississippi or in any other\r\ndirection, by such vessels for them to make an attack on it. In the\r\nGulf, within our limits west of Florida, which had been acquired since\r\nthese works were decided on and commenced, there is no bay or river into\r\nwhich large ships of war can enter. As a defense, therefore, against an\r\nattack from such vessels extensive works would be altogether unnecessary\r\neither at Mobile Point or at Dauphine Island, since sloops of war only\r\ncan navigate the deepest channel. But it is not for that purpose\r\nalone that these works are intended. It is to provide also against a\r\nformidable invasion, both by land and sea, the object of which may be to\r\nshake the foundation of our system. Should such small works be erected,\r\nand such an invasion take place, they would be sure to fall at once into\r\nthe hands of the invaders and to be turned against us.\r\n\r\nWhether the acquisition of Florida may be considered as affording an\r\ninducement to make any change in the position or strength of these works\r\nis a circumstance which also merits attention. From the view which\r\nI have taken of the subject I am of opinion that it should not. The\r\ndefense of New Orleans and of the river Mississippi against a powerful\r\ninvasion being one of the great objects of such extensive works, that\r\nobject would be essentially abandoned if they should be established\r\neastward of the bay of Mobile, since the force to be collected in\r\nthem would be placed at too great a distance to allow the cooperation\r\nnecessary for those purposes between it and that at the city; in\r\naddition to which, it may be observed that by carrying them to Pensacola\r\nor farther to the east that bay would fall immediately, in case of such\r\ninvasion, into the hands of the enemy, whereby such cooperation would be\r\nrendered utterly impossible, and the State of Alabama would also be left\r\nwholly unprotected.\r\n\r\nWith a view to such formidable invasion, of which we should never lose\r\nsight, and of the great objects to which it would be directed, I think\r\nthat very strong works at some point within the Gulf of Mexico will\r\nbe found indispensable. I think also that those works ought to be\r\nestablished at the bay of Mobile--one at Mobile Point and the other on\r\nDauphine Island--whereby the enemy would be excluded and the complete\r\ncommand of that bay, with all the advantages attending it, be secured\r\nto ourselves. In the case of such invasion, it will, it is presumed,\r\nbe deemed necessary to collect at some point other than at New Orleans\r\na strong force, capable of moving in any direction and affording aid\r\nto any part which may be attacked; and, in my judgment, no position\r\npresents so many advantages as a point of rendezvous for such force as\r\nthe mouth of that bay. The fortification at the Rigolets will defend the\r\nentrance by one passage into Lake Pontchartrain, and also into Pearl\r\nRiver, which empties into the Gulf at that point. Between the Rigolets\r\nand Mobile Bay there are but two inlets which deserve the name, those of\r\nSt. Louis and Pascagola, the entrance into which is too shallow even\r\nfor the smallest vessels; and from the Rigolets to Mobile Bay the whole\r\ncoast is equally shallow, affording the depth of a few feet of water\r\nonly. Cat Island, which is nearest the Rigolets, is about 7-1/2 miles\r\ndistant from the coast and 30 from the Rigolets. Ship Island is distant\r\nabout 10 miles from Cat Island and 12 from the coast. Between these\r\nislands and the coast the water is very shallow.\r\n\r\nAs to the precise depth of water in approaching those islands from the\r\nGulf, the report of the topographical engineers not having yet been\r\nreceived, it is impossible to speak with precision; but admitting it\r\nto be such as for frigates and even ships of the line to enter, the\r\nanchorage at both is unsafe, being much exposed to northwest winds.\r\nAlong the coast, therefore, there is no motive for such strong works on\r\nour part--no town to guard, no inlet into the country to defend--and if\r\nplaced on the islands and the entrance to them is such as to admit large\r\nships of war, distant as they are from the coast, it would be more easy\r\nfor the enemy to assail them with effect.\r\n\r\nThe position, however, at Mobile Bay is essentially different. That bay\r\ntakes its name from the Mobile River, which is formed by the junction of\r\nthe Alabama and Tombigbee, which extend each about 300 miles into the\r\ninterior, approaching at their head waters near the Tennessee River.\r\nIf the enemy possessed its mouth, and fortified Mobile Point and\r\nDauphine Island, being superior at sea it would be very difficult for\r\nus to dispossess him of either, even of Mobile Point; and holding that\r\nposition, Pensacola would soon fall, as without incurring great expense\r\nin the construction of works there it would present but a feeble\r\nresistance to a strong force in its rear. If we had a work at Mobile\r\nPoint only, the enemy might take Dauphine Island, which would afford\r\nhim great aid in attacking the point, and enable him, even should we\r\nsucceed in repelling the attack, to render us great mischief there and\r\nthroughout the whole Gulf. In every view which can be taken of the\r\nsubject it appears indispensable for us to command the entrance into\r\nMobile Bay, and that decision being taken, I think the considerations\r\nwhich favor the occupation of Dauphine Island by a strong work are\r\nconclusive. It is proper to observe that after the repulse before New\r\nOrleans in the late war the British forces took possession of Dauphine\r\nIsland and held it till the peace. Under neither of the reports of the\r\nBoard of Engineers and Naval Commissioners could any but sloops of war\r\nenter the bay or the anchorage between Dauphine and Pelican islands.\r\nBoth reports give to that anchorage 18 feet at low water and 20-1/2 at\r\nhigh. The only difference between them consists in this, that in the\r\nfirst a bar leading to the anchorage, reducing the depth of water to\r\n12 feet at low tide, was omitted. In neither case could frigates enter,\r\nthough sloops of war of larger size might. The whole scope, however, of\r\nthis reasoning turns on a different principle--on the works necessary to\r\ndefend that bay and, by means thereof, New Orleans, the Mississippi, and\r\nall the surrounding country against a powerful invasion both by land and\r\nsea, and not on the precise depth of water in any of the approaches to\r\nthe bay or to the island.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning which is applicable to the works near New Orleans and at\r\nthe bay of Mobile is equally so in certain respects to those which are\r\nto be erected for the defense of all the bays and rivers along the other\r\nparts of the coast. All those works are also erected on a greater scale\r\nthan would be necessary for the sole purpose of preventing the passage\r\nof our inlets by large ships of war. They are in most instances formed\r\nfor defense against a more powerful invasion, both by land and sea.\r\nThere are, however, some differences between the works which are deemed\r\nnecessary in the Gulf and those in other parts of our Union, founded on\r\nthe peculiar situation of that part of the coast. The vast extent of\r\nthe Mississippi, the great outlet and channel of commerce for so many\r\nStates, all of which may be affected by the seizure of that city, or\r\nof any part of the river to a great extent above it, is one of those\r\nstriking peculiarities which require particular provision. The thinness\r\nof the population near the city, making it necessary that the force\r\nrequisite for its defense should be called from distant parts and\r\nStates, is another. The danger which the army assembled at New Orleans\r\nwould be exposed to of being cut off in case the enemy should throw a\r\nforce on the river above it, from the difficulty of ascending the river\r\nto attack it and of making a retreat in any other direction, is a third.\r\nFor an attack on the city of New Orleans, Mobile Bay, or any part of the\r\nintermediate coast ships of war would be necessary only as a convoy to\r\nprotect the transports against a naval force on their passage, and on\r\ntheir approach to the shore for the landing of the men, and on their\r\nreturn home in case they should be repulsed.\r\n\r\nOn the important subject of our defenses generally I think proper to\r\nobserve that the system was adopted immediately after the late war by\r\nCongress, on great consideration and a thorough knowledge of the effects\r\nof that war--by the enormous expense attending it, by the waste of life,\r\nof property, and by the general distress of the country. The amount of\r\ndebt incurred in that war and due at its conclusion, without taking into\r\nthe estimate other losses, having been heretofore communicated, need\r\nnot now be repeated. The interest of the debt thus incurred is four\r\ntimes more than the sum necessary, by annual appropriations, for the\r\ncompletion of our whole system of defense, land and naval, to the extent\r\nprovided for and within the time specified. When that system shall be\r\ncompleted the expense of construction will cease, and our expenditures\r\nbe proportionally diminished. Should another war occur before it is\r\ncompleted, the experience of the last marks in characters too strong\r\nto be mistaken its inevitable consequences; and should such war occur\r\nand find us unprepared for it, what will be our justification to the\r\nenlightened body whom we represent for not having completed these\r\ndefenses? That this system should not have been adopted before the late\r\nwar can not be a cause of surprise to anyone, because all might wish\r\nto avoid every expense the necessity of which might be in any degree\r\ndoubtful. But with the experience of that war before us it is thought\r\nthere is no cause for hesitation. Will the completion of these works and\r\nthe augmentation of our Navy to the point contemplated by law require\r\nthe imposition of onerous burthens on our fellow-citizens such as they\r\ncan not or will not bear? Have such, or any, burthens been imposed to\r\nadvance the system to its present state? It is known that no burthens\r\nwhatever have been imposed; on the contrary, that all the direct or\r\ninternal taxes have been long repealed, and none paid but those which\r\nare indirect and voluntary, such as are imposed on articles imported\r\nfrom foreign countries, most of which are luxuries, and on the vessels\r\nemployed in the transportation--taxes which some of our most enlightened\r\ncitizens think ought to be imposed on many of the articles for the\r\nencouragement of our manufactures, even if the revenue derived from them\r\ncould be dispensed with. It is known also that in all other respects\r\nour condition as a nation is in the highest degree prosperous and\r\nflourishing, nearly half the debt incurred in the late war having\r\nalready been discharged, and considerable progress having also been made\r\nin the completion of this system of defense and in the construction of\r\nother works of great extent and utility, by the revenue derived from\r\nthese sources and from the sale of the public lands. I may add also\r\nthat a very generous provision has been made from the same sources for\r\nthe surviving officers and soldiers of our Revolutionary army. These\r\nimportant facts show that this system has been so far executed, and may\r\nbe completed without any real inconvenience to the public. Were it,\r\nhowever, otherwise, I have full confidence that any burthens which\r\nmight be found necessary for the completion of this system in both\r\nits branches within the term contemplated, or much sooner should any\r\nemergency require it, would be called for rather than complained of\r\nby our fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nFrom these views, applicable to the very important subject of our\r\ndefenses generally as well as to the work at Dauphine Island, I think\r\nit my duty to recommend to Congress an appropriation for the latter.\r\nI considered the withholding it at the last session as the expression\r\nonly of a doubt by Congress of the propriety of the position, and not\r\nas a definitive opinion. Supposing that that question would be decided\r\nat the present session, I caused the position and such parts of the\r\ncoast as are particularly connected with it to be reexamined, that all\r\nthe light on which the decision as to the appropriation could depend\r\nmight be fully before you. In the first survey, the report of which\r\nwas that on which the works intended for the defense of New Orleans,\r\nthe Mississippi, the bay of Mobile, and all the country dependent on\r\nthose waters were sanctioned by the Executive, the commissioners were\r\nindustriously engaged about six months. I should have communicated that\r\nvery able and interesting document then but from a doubt how far the\r\ninterest of our country would justify its publication, a circumstance\r\nwhich I now mention that the attention of Congress may be drawn to it.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 26, 1822.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving executed the act entitled \"An act to reduce and fix the military\r\npeace establishment of the United States\" on great consideration and\r\naccording to my best judgment, and inferring from the rejection of\r\nthe nomination of Colonel Towson and Colonel Gadsden, officers of very\r\ndistinguished merit, that the view which I took of that law has not been\r\nwell understood, I hereby withdraw all the nominations on which the\r\nSenate has not decided until I can make a more full communication and\r\nexplanation of that view and of the principles on which I have acted\r\nin the discharge of that very delicate and important duty.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 27, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n1st instant, requesting \"the President to communicate such information\r\nas he may possess relative to any private claim against the piece of\r\nland in the Delaware River known by the name of the Peapatch, and to\r\nstate if any, and what, process has been instituted in behalf of such\r\nclaim,\" I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of War,\r\nfurnishing the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 28, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit the original reports on the subject of the fortifications on\r\nDauphin Island and Mobile Point, being those on which the works were\r\nundertaken and have been in part executed. The doubt expressed as to the\r\npropriety of publication is applicable to this document, which would\r\nhave accompanied the message of the 26th had it been prepared in time.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 29, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress the translation of two letters from the minister\r\nof France to the Secretary of State, relating to the claim of the heirs\r\nof Caron de Beaumarchais upon this Government, with the documents\r\ntherewith inclosed, recommending them to the favorable consideration\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 5, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith to the House a report from the Secretary of War,\r\ncontaining the information requested by their resolution of the 5th\r\nultimo.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper further to add that the secretaries of both the\r\nTerritories have occasionally required and received the aid of the\r\nmilitary force of the United States stationed within them, respectively,\r\nto carry into effect the acts of their authority.\r\n\r\nThe government of East and West Florida was under the Spanish dominion\r\nalmost exclusively military. The governors of both were military\r\nofficers and united in their persons the chief authority, both civil\r\nand military.\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which the act of Congress of the last session\r\nproviding for the temporary government of the newly ceded Provinces was\r\ncarried into execution has been communicated to Congress in my message\r\nat the opening of the session. It was to leave the authorities of the\r\ncountry as they were found existing at the time of the cession, to be\r\nexercised until the meeting of Congress, when it was known that the\r\nintroduction of a system more congenial to our own institutions would be\r\none of the earliest and most important subjects of their deliberations.\r\nFrom this, among other obvious considerations, military officers were\r\nappointed to take possession of both Provinces. But as the military\r\ncommand of General Jackson was to cease on the 1st of June, General\r\nGaines, the officer next in command, then here, who was first designated\r\nto take possession of East Florida, received from me a verbal direction\r\nto give such effect to any requisition from the governor for military\r\naid to enforce his authority as the circumstances might require. It was\r\nnot foreseen that the command in both the Provinces would before further\r\nlegislation by Congress on that subject devolve upon the secretaries of\r\nthe Territories, but had it been foreseen the same direction would have\r\nbeen given as applicable to them.\r\n\r\nNo authority has been given to either of the secretaries to issue\r\ncommands to that portion of the Army which is in Florida, and whenever\r\nthe aid of _the military_ has been required by them it has been by\r\nwritten requisitions to the officers commanding the troops, who have\r\nyielded compliance thereto doubtless under the directions received\r\nfrom General Gaines as understood by him to be authorized.\r\n\r\nShortly before the meeting of Congress a letter was received at the War\r\nDepartment from Colonel Brooke, the officer commanding at Pensacola,\r\nrequesting instructions how far he was to consider these requisitions\r\nas authoritative, but the assurance that a new organization of the\r\ngovernment was immediately to be authorized by Congress was a motive\r\nfor superseding any specific decision upon the inquiry.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 6, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nrequesting the President of the United States to cause to be furnished\r\nto that House certain information relating to the amount of the public\r\nmoney paid to the Attorney-General over and above his salary fixed by\r\nlaw since the 1st of January, 1817, specifying the time when paid and\r\nthe fund out of which such payments have been made, I transmit a paper,\r\nmarked A, containing the information desired. I transmit also a paper,\r\nmarked B, containing a statement of sums paid to Attorney General of the\r\nUnited States prior to the 1st of January, 1817, and in the paper marked\r\nC a like statement of sums advanced to district attorneys for services\r\nnot required of them by law. These latter documents being necessary to\r\na full view of the subject, it is thought proper to comprise them in\r\nthis communication.\r\n\r\nBy the act of 24th September, 1789, instituting the office of Attorney\r\nGeneral, it was made his duty to prosecute and conduct all suits in the\r\nSupreme Court in which the United States should be concerned, and to\r\ngive his advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the\r\nPresident of the United States, or when requested by the head of any\r\nof the Departments, touching any matters that might concern their\r\nDepartments. It will be seen, therefore, by the statement communicated\r\nthat no money whatever has been paid to the Attorney General for his\r\nservices in that character, nor for any duty belonging to his office,\r\nbeyond his salary as fixed by law.\r\n\r\nIt will also be shewn by the documents communicated that the\r\nconstruction given of the laws imposing duties on the Attorney General\r\nand district attorneys have been invariably the same since the\r\ninstitution of the Government. On the same authority it was thought\r\nthat the compensation allowed to the present Attorney General for\r\ncertain services, considering their importance and the time employed\r\nin rendering them, did not exceed, regarding precedents, what might\r\nfairly be claimed.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 13, 1822.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving cause to infer that the reasons which led to the construction\r\nwhich I gave to the act of the last session entitled \"An act to reduce\r\nand fix the peace establishment of the United States\" have not been well\r\nunderstood, I consider it my duty to explain more fully the view which\r\nI took of that act and of the principles on which I executed the very\r\ndifficult and important duty enjoined on me by it.\r\n\r\nTo do justice to the subject it is thought proper to show the actual\r\nstate of the Army before the passage of the late act, the force in\r\nservice, the several corps of which it was composed, and the grades\r\nand number of officers commanding it. By seeing distinctly the body\r\nin all its parts on which the law operated, viewing also with a just\r\ndiscrimination the spirit, policy, and positive injunctions of that law\r\nwith reference to precedents established in a former analogous case,\r\nwe shall be enabled to ascertain with great precision whether these\r\ninjunctions have or have not been strictly complied with.\r\n\r\nBy the act of the 3d of March, 1815, entitled \"An act fixing the\r\nmilitary peace establishment of the United States,\" the whole force\r\nin service was reduced to 10,000 men--infantry, artillery, and\r\nriflemen--exclusive of the Corps of Engineers, which was retained in its\r\nthen state. The regiment of light artillery was retained as it had been\r\norganized by the act of 3d March, 1814. The infantry was formed into\r\n9 regiments, 1 of which consisted of riflemen. The regiments of light\r\nartillery, infantry, riflemen, and Corps of Engineers were commanded\r\neach by a colonel, lieutenant-colonel, and the usual battalion and\r\ncompany officers; and the battalions of the corps of artillery, of which\r\nthere were 8--4 for the Northern and 4 for the Southern division--were\r\ncommanded by lieutenant-colonels or majors, there being 4 of each grade.\r\nThere were, therefore, in the Army at the time the late law was passed\r\n12 colonels belonging to those branches of the military establishment.\r\nTwo major-generals and 4 brigadiers were likewise retained in service by\r\nthis act; but the staff in several of its branches not being provided\r\nfor, and being indispensable and the omission inadvertent, proceeding\r\nfrom the circumstances under which the act was passed, being at the\r\nclose of the session, at which time intelligence of the peace was\r\nreceived, it was provisionally retained by the President, and provided\r\nfor afterwards by the act of the 24th April, 1816. By this act the\r\nOrdnance Department was preserved as it had been organized by the act\r\nof February 8, 1815, with 1 colonel, 1 lieutenant-colonel, 2 majors,\r\n10 captains, and 10 first, second, and third lieutenants. One Adjutant\r\nand Inspector General of the Army and 2 adjutants-general--1 for the\r\nNorthern and 1 for the Southern division--were retained. This act\r\nprovides also for a Paymaster-General, with a suitable number of\r\nregimental and battalion paymasters, as a part of the general staff,\r\nconstituting the military peace establishment; and the Pay Department\r\nand every other branch of the staff were subjected to the Rules and\r\nArticles of War.\r\n\r\nBy the act of March 2, 1821, it was ordained that the military peace\r\nestablishment should consist of 4 regiments of artillery and 7 of\r\ninfantry, with such officers of engineers, ordnance, and staff as were\r\ntherein specified. It is provided that each regiment of artillery should\r\nconsist of 1 colonel, 1 lieutenant-colonel, 1 major, and 9 companies,\r\nwith the usual company officers, 1 of which to be equipped as light\r\nartillery, and that there should be attached to each regiment of\r\nartillery 1 supernumerary captain to perform ordnance duty, thereby\r\nmerging the regiment of artillery and Ordnance Department into these\r\n4 regiments. It was provided also that each regiment of infantry should\r\nconsist of 1 colonel, 1 lieutenant colonel, 1 major, and 10 companies,\r\nwith the usual company officers. The Corps of Engineers, bombardiers\r\nexcepted, with the topographical engineers and their assistants, were\r\nto be retained under the existing organization. The former establishment\r\nas to the number of major generals and brigadiers was curtailed one-half,\r\nand the office of Inspector and Adjutant General to the Army and of\r\nadjutant-general to each division annulled, and that of Adjutant General\r\nto the Army instituted. The Quartermaster, Paymaster, and Commissary\r\nDepartments were also specially provided for, as was every other branch\r\nof the staff, all of which received a new modification, and were\r\nsubjected to the Rules and Articles of War.\r\n\r\nThe immediate and direct operation of this act on the military peace\r\nestablishment of 1815 was that of reduction, from which no officer\r\nbelonging to it was exempt, unless it might be the topographical\r\nengineers; for in retaining the Corps of Engineers, as was manifest\r\nas well by the clear import of the section relating to it as by the\r\nprovisions of every other clause of the act, reference was had to the\r\norganization, and not to the officers of the Corps. The establishment\r\nof 1815 was reduced from 10,000 to about 6,000 men. The 8 battalions of\r\nartillery, constituting what was called the corps of artillery, and the\r\nregiment of light artillery as established by the act of 1815, were to\r\nbe incorporated together and formed into 4 new regiments. The regiments\r\nof infantry were to be reduced from 9 to 7, the rifle regiment being\r\nbroken. Three of the general officers were to be reduced, with very\r\nmany of the officers belonging to the several corps of the Army, and\r\nparticularly of the infantry. All the provisions of the act declare of\r\nwhat number of officers and men the several corps provided for by it\r\nshould thenceforward consist, and not that any corps as then existing\r\nor any officer of any corps, unless the topographical engineers were\r\nexcepted, should be retained. Had it been intended to reduce the\r\nofficers by corps, or to exempt the officers of any corps from the\r\noperation of the law, or in the organization of the several new corps\r\nto confine the selection of the officers to be placed in them to the\r\nseveral corps of the like kind then existing, and not extend it to the\r\nwhole military establishment, including the staff, or to confine the\r\nreduction to a proportional number of each corps and of each grade\r\nin each corps, the object in either instance might have been easily\r\naccomplished by a declaration to that effect. No such declaration was\r\nmade, nor can such intention be inferred. We see, on the contrary, that\r\nevery corps of the Army and staff was to be reorganized, and most of\r\nthem reduced in officers and men, and that in arranging the officers\r\nfrom the old to the new corps full power was granted to the President\r\nto take them from any and every corps of the former establishment and\r\nplace them in the latter. In this latter grant of power it is proper\r\nto observe that the most comprehensive terms that could be adopted were\r\nused, the authority being to cause the arrangement to be made from the\r\nofficers of the several _corps_ then in the service of the United\r\nStates, comprising, of course, every corps of the staff, as well as of\r\nartillery and infantry, and not from the _corps of troops_, as in the\r\nformer act, and without any limitation as to grades.\r\n\r\nIt merits particular attention that although the object of this\r\nlatter act was reduction and such its effect on an extensive scale,\r\n5 new offices were created by it--4 of the grade of colonel for the\r\n4 regiments of artillery and that of Adjutant-General for the Army. Three\r\nof the first mentioned were altogether new, the corps having been newly\r\ncreated, and although 1 officer of that grade as applicable to the corps\r\nof light artillery had existed, yet as that regiment was reduced and\r\nall its parts reorganized in another form and with other duties, being\r\nincorporated into the 4 new regiments, the commander was manifestly\r\ndisplaced and incapable of taking the command of either of the new\r\nregiments or any station in them until he should be authorized to do so\r\nby a new appointment. The same remarks are applicable to the office of\r\nAdjutant-General to the Army. It is an office of new creation, differing\r\nfrom that of Adjutant and Inspector General, and likewise from that\r\nof adjutant-general to a division, which were severally annulled. It\r\ndiffers from the first in title, rank, and pay, and from the two latter\r\nbecause they had been created by law each for a division, whereas the\r\nnew office, being instituted without such special designation, could\r\nhave relation only to the whole Army. It was manifest, therefore, that\r\nneither of those officers had any right to this new station nor to\r\nany other station unless he should be specially appointed to it, the\r\nprinciple of reduction being applicable to every officer in every corps.\r\nIt is proper also to observe that the duties of Adjutant-General under\r\nthe existing arrangement correspond in almost every circumstance with\r\nthose of the late Adjutant and Inspector General, and not with those\r\nof an adjutant-general of a division.\r\n\r\nTo give effect to this law the President was authorized by the twelfth\r\nsection to cause the officers, noncommissioned officers, artificers,\r\nmusicians, and privates of the several corps then in the service of the\r\nUnited States to be arranged in such manner as to form and complete\r\nout of the same the force thereby provided for, and to cause the\r\nsupernumerary officers, noncommissioned officers, artificers, musicians,\r\nand privates to be discharged from the service.\r\n\r\nIn executing this very delicate and important trust I acted with the\r\nutmost precaution. Sensible of what I owed to my country, I felt\r\nstrongly the obligation of observing the utmost impartiality in\r\nselecting those officers who were to be retained. In executing this law\r\nI had no personal object to accomplish or feeling to gratify--no one\r\nto retain, no one to remove. Having on great consideration fixed the\r\nprinciples on which the reduction should be made, I availed myself\r\nof the example of my predecessor by appointing through the proper\r\ndepartment a board of general officers to make the selection, and\r\nwhose report I adopted.\r\n\r\nIn transferring the officers from the old to the new corps the utmost\r\ncare was taken to place them in the latter in the grades and corps to\r\nwhich they had respectively belonged in the former, so far as it might\r\nbe practicable. This, though not enjoined by the law, appearing to be\r\njust and proper, was never departed from except in peculiar cases and\r\nunder imperious circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn filling the original vacancies in the artillery and in the newly\r\ncreated office of Adjutant-General I considered myself at liberty to\r\nplace in them any officer belonging to any part of the whole military\r\nestablishment, whether of the staff or line. In filling original\r\nvacancies--that is, offices newly created--it is my opinion, as a\r\ngeneral principle, that Congress have no right under the Constitution\r\nto impose any restraint by law on the power granted to the President\r\nso as to prevent his making a free selection of proper persons for these\r\noffices from the whole body of his fellow-citizens. Without, however,\r\nentering here into that question, I have no hesitation in declaring it\r\nas my opinion that the law fully authorized a selection from any branch\r\nof the whole military establishment of 1815. Justified, therefore, as\r\nI thought myself in taking that range by the very highest sanction, the\r\nsole object to which I had to direct my attention was the merit of the\r\nofficers to be selected for these stations. Three generals of great\r\nmerit were either to be dismissed or otherwise provided for. The\r\nvery gallant and patriotic defender of New Orleans had intimated his\r\nintention to retire, but at my suggestion expressed his willingness\r\nto accept the office of commissioner to receive the cession of the\r\nFloridas and of governor for a short time of that Territory. As to one,\r\ntherefore, there was no difficulty. For the other two provision could\r\nonly be made in the mode which was adopted. General Macomb, who had\r\nsignalized himself in the defense of Plattsburg, was placed at the head\r\nof the Corps of Engineers, to which he had originally belonged, and in\r\nwhich he had acquired great experience, Colonel Armistead, then at the\r\nhead of that corps, having voluntarily accepted one of the new regiments\r\nof artillery, for which he possessed very suitable qualifications.\r\nGeneral Atkinson, likewise an officer of great merit, was appointed to\r\nthe newly created office of Adjutant-General. Brevet General Porter, an\r\nofficer of great experience in the artillery, and merit, was appointed\r\nto the command of another of those regiments. Colonel Fenwick, then the\r\noldest lieutenant-colonel of artillery, and who had suffered much in the\r\nlate war by severe wounds, was appointed to a third, and Colonel Towson,\r\nwho had served with great distinction in the same corps and been twice\r\nbrevetted for his gallantry in the late war, was appointed to the last\r\nremaining one. General Atkinson having declined the office of Adjutant\r\nGeneral, Colonel Gadsden, an officer of distinguished merit and believed\r\nto possess qualifications suitably adapted to it, was appointed in\r\nhis stead. In making the arrangement the merits of Colonel Butler and\r\nColonel Jones were not overlooked. The former was assigned to the place\r\nwhich he would have held in the line if he had retained his original\r\nlineal commission, and the latter to his commission in the line, which\r\nhe had continued to hold with his staff appointment.\r\n\r\nThat the reduction of the Army and the arrangement of the officers\r\nfrom the old to the new establishment and the appointments referred to\r\nwere in every instance strictly conformable to law will, I think, be\r\napparent. To the arrangement generally no objection has been heard; it\r\nhas been made, however, to the appointments to the original vacancies,\r\nand particularly to those of Colonel Towson and Colonel Gadsden. To\r\nthose appointments, therefore, further attention is due. If they were\r\nimproper it must be either that they were illegal or that the officers\r\ndid not merit the offices conferred on them. The acknowledged merit of\r\nthe officers and the peculiar fitness for the offices to which they were\r\nrespectively appointed must preclude all objection on that head. Having\r\nalready suggested my impression that in filling offices newly created,\r\nto which on no principle whatever anyone could have a claim of right,\r\nCongress could not under the Constitution restrain the free selection of\r\nthe President from the whole body of his fellow-citizens, I shall only\r\nfurther remark that if that impression is well founded all objection\r\nto these appointments must cease. If the law imposed such restraint,\r\nit would in that case be void. But, according to my judgment, the law\r\nimposed none. An objection to the legality of those appointments must be\r\nfounded either on the principle that those officers were not comprised\r\nwithin the corps then in the service of the United States--that is, did\r\nnot belong to the peace establishment--or that the power granted by\r\nthe word \"arrange\" imposed on the President the necessity of placing\r\nin these new offices persons of the same grade only from the old. It is\r\nbelieved that neither objection is well founded. Colonel Towson belonged\r\nto one of the corps then in the service of the United States, or, in\r\nother words, of the military peace establishment. By the act of 1815-16\r\nthe Pay Department, of which the Paymaster General was the chief, was\r\nmade one of the branches of the staff, and he and all those under him\r\nwere subjected to the Rules and Articles of War. The appointment,\r\ntherefore, of him, and especially to a new office, was strictly\r\nconformable to law.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between the fifth section of the act of 1815 for\r\nreducing the Army and the twelfth section of the act of 1821 for still\r\nfurther reducing it, by which the power to carry those laws into effect\r\nwas granted to the President in each instance, consists in this, that by\r\nthe former he was to cause the arrangement to be made of the officers,\r\nnoncommissioned officers, musicians, and privates of the several _corps\r\nof troops_ then in the service of the United States, whereas in the\r\nlatter the term _troops_ was omitted. It can not be doubted that that\r\nomission had an object, and that it was thereby intended to guard\r\nagainst misconstruction in so very material and important a circumstance\r\nby authorizing the application of the act unequivocally to every corps\r\nof the staff as well as of the line. With that word a much wider range\r\nwas given to the act of 1815 on the reduction which then took place than\r\nunder the last act. The omission of it from the last act, together with\r\nall the sanctions which were given by Congress to the construction of\r\nthe law in the reduction made under the former, could not fail to dispel\r\nall doubt as to the extent of the power granted by the last law and of\r\nthe principles which ought to guide, and on which it was thereby made\r\nthe duty of the President to execute it. With respect to the other\r\nobjection--that is, that officers of the same grade only ought to have\r\nbeen transferred to these new offices--it is equally unfounded. It is\r\nadmitted that officers may be taken from the old corps and reduced and\r\narranged in the new in inferior grades, as was done under the former\r\nreduction. This admission puts an end to the objection in this case;\r\nfor if an officer may be reduced and arranged from one corps to another\r\nby an entire change of grade, requiring a new commission and a new\r\nnomination to the Senate, I see no reason why an officer may not be\r\nadvanced in like manner. In both instances the grade in the old corps\r\nis alike disregarded. The transfer from it to the new turns on the merit\r\nof the party, and it is believed that the claim in this instance is felt\r\nby all with peculiar sensibility. The claim of Colonel Towson is the\r\nstronger because the arrangement of him to the office to which he is now\r\nnominated is not to one from which any officer has been removed, and to\r\nwhich any other officer may in any view of the case be supposed to have\r\nhad a claim. As Colonel Gadsden held the office of Inspector-General,\r\nand as such was acknowledged by all to belong to the staff of the Army,\r\nit is not perceived on what ground his appointment can be objected to.\r\n\r\nIf such a construction is to be given to the act of 1821 as to confine\r\nthe transfer of officers from the old to the new establishment to the\r\n_corps of troops_--that is, to the line of the Army--the whole staff of\r\nthe Army in every branch would not only be excluded from any appointment\r\nin the new establishment, but altogether disbanded from the service.\r\nIt would follow also that all the offices of the staff under the\r\nnew arrangement must be filled by officers belonging to the new\r\nestablishment after its organization and their arrangement in it.\r\nOther consequences not less serious would follow. If the right of the\r\nPresident to fill these original vacancies by the selection of officers\r\nfrom any branch of the whole military establishment was denied, he would\r\nbe compelled to place in them officers of the same grade whose corps had\r\nbeen reduced, and they with them. The effect, therefore, of the law as\r\nto those appointments would be to legislate into office men who had been\r\nalready legislated out of office, taking from the President all agency\r\nin their appointment. Such a construction would not only be subversive\r\nof the obvious principles of the Constitution, but utterly inconsistent\r\nwith the spirit of the law itself, since it would provide offices for\r\na particular grade, and fix every member of that grade in those offices,\r\nat a time when every other grade was reduced, and among them generals\r\nand other officers of the highest merit. It would also defeat every\r\nobject of selection, since colonels of infantry would be placed at the\r\nhead of regiments of artillery, a service in which they might have had\r\nno experience, and for which they might in consequence be unqualified.\r\n\r\nHaving omitted in the message to Congress at the commencement of the\r\nsession to state the principles on which this law had been executed, and\r\nhaving imperfectly explained them in the message to the Senate of the\r\n17th of January last, I deem it particularly incumbent on me, as well\r\nfrom a motive of respect to the Senate as to place my conduct in the\r\nduty imposed on me by that act in a clear point of view, to make this\r\ncommunication at this time. The examples under the law of 1815, whereby\r\nofficers were reduced and arranged from the old corps to the new in\r\ninferior grades, fully justify all that has been done under the law\r\nof 1821. If the power to arrange under the former law authorized the\r\nremoval of one officer from a particular station and the location of\r\nanother in it, reducing the latter from a higher to an inferior grade,\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, it surely justifies under\r\nthe latter law the arrangement of these officers, with a like sanction,\r\nto offices of new creation, from which no one had been removed and to\r\nwhich no one had a just claim. It is on the authority of these examples,\r\nsupported by the construction which I gave to the law, that I have acted\r\nin the discharge of this high trust. I am aware that many officers of\r\ngreat merit, having the strongest claims on their country, have been\r\nreduced and others dismissed, but under the law that result was\r\ninevitable. It is believed that none have been retained who had not,\r\nlikewise, the strongest claims to the appointments which have been\r\nconferred on them. To discriminate between men of acknowledged merit,\r\nespecially in a way to affect so sensibly and materially their feelings\r\nand interests, for many of whom I have personal consideration and\r\nregard, has been a most painful duty; yet I am conscious that I have\r\ndischarged it with the utmost impartiality. Had I opened the door to\r\nchange in any case, even where error might have been committed, against\r\nwhom could I afterwards have closed it, and into what consequences might\r\nnot such a proceeding have led? The same remarks are applicable to the\r\nsubject in its relation to the Senate, to whose calm and enlightened\r\njudgment, with these explanations, I again submit the nominations which\r\nhave been rejected.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 15, 1822.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 12th instant,\r\nrequesting the President of the United States \"to cause to be laid\r\nbefore the Senate the original proceedings of the board of general\r\nofficers charged with the reduction of the Army under the act of the 2d\r\nof March, 1821, together with all communications to and from said board\r\non the subject of reducing the Army, including the case submitted to the\r\nAttorney-General, and his opinion thereon,\" I now transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of War, furnishing the information requested.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 15, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate requesting the President\r\nof the United States to lay before that House any report or information\r\nwhich may be in his possession as to the most eligible situation on\r\nthe Western waters for the erection of a national arsenal, I herewith\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of War, containing all the\r\ninformation on that subject in the possession of the Executive.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 15, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n16th of February last, requesting the President of the United States\r\n\"to communicate to that House whether any foreign government has made\r\nany claim to any part of the territory of the United States upon the\r\ncoast of the Pacific Ocean north of the forty-second degree of latitude,\r\nand to what extent; whether any regulations have been made by foreign\r\npowers affecting the trade on that coast, and how it affects the interest\r\nof this Republic, and whether any communications have been made to this\r\nGovernment by foreign powers touching the contemplated occupation of\r\nColumbia River,\" I now transmit a report from the Secretary of State,\r\ncontaining the information embraced by that resolution.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 18, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the House of Representatives copies of sundry papers\r\nhaving relation to the transactions in East and West Florida, which have\r\nbeen received at the Department of State since my message to the two\r\nHouses of Congress of the 28th of January last, together with copies\r\nof two letters from the Secretary of State upon the same subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n[The same message was sent to the Senate.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 23, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n29th January last, requesting the President of the United States to\r\ncause to be communicated to that House certain information relative to\r\nthe claim made by Jonathan Carver to certain lands within the United\r\nStates near the Falls of St. Anthony.

I transmit a copy of the report of the Secretary of State,\r\nby which it appears that Mr. Russell, on being apprised that the document\r\nreferred to by the resolution had not been deposited in the Department\r\nof State, delivered there \"a paper purporting to be the duplicate of a\r\nletter written by him from Paris on the 11th of February, 1815, to the\r\nthen Secretary of State, to be communicated to the House as the letter\r\ncalled for by the resolution.\"\r\n\r\nOn the perusal of the document called for I find that it communicates\r\na difference of opinion between Mr. Russell and a majority of his\r\ncolleagues in certain transactions which occurred in the negotiations at\r\nGhent, touching interests which have been since satisfactorily adjusted\r\nby treaty between the United States and Great Britain. The view which\r\nMr. Russell presents of his own conduct and that of his colleagues in\r\nthose transactions will, it is presumed, call from the two surviving\r\nmembers of that mission who differed from him a reply containing\r\ntheir view of those transactions and of the conduct of the parties\r\nin them, and who, should his letter be communicated to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, will also claim that their reply should be communicated\r\nin like manner by the Executive--a claim which, on the principle of\r\nequal justice, could not be resisted.

Donojú, and some papers were seen relative to\r\nthose same transactions, it was feared that for forming the treaty\r\nconcluded in Cordova on the 24th of August last between the said General\r\nand the traitor, Colonel Dr. Augustine Iturbide, it had been falsely\r\nsupposed that the former had power from His Catholic Majesty for that\r\nact, and in a little time the correctness of those suspicions was found,\r\nas, among other things, the said O. Donojú, when on the 26th of the same\r\nAugust he sent this treaty to the governor of Vera Cruz, notifying\r\nhim of its prompt and punctual observance, he told him that at his\r\nsailing from the Peninsula preparation for the independence of Mexico\r\nwas already thought of, and that its bases were approved of by the\r\nGovernment and by a commission of the Cortes. His Majesty, on sight\r\nof this and of the fatal impression which so great an imposture had\r\nproduced in some ultramarine Provinces, and what must without difficulty\r\nbe the consequence among the rest, thought proper to order that, by\r\nmeans of a circular to all the chiefs and corporations beyond seas,\r\nthis atrocious falsehood should be disbelieved; and now he has deigned\r\nto command me to make it known to the Government of the United States\r\nthat it is false as far as General O. Donojú published beyond his\r\ninstructions, by pointing out to it that he never could have been\r\nfurnished with other instructions than those conformable to\r\nconstitutional principles.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this order of His Majesty, I can do no less than\r\nobserve to you, sir, how unfounded one of the reasons is in your note\r\nof the 6th instant for the recognition by this Government of those of\r\nthe insurgent Provinces of Spanish-America--that it was founded on the\r\ntreaty made by O. Donojú with Iturbide--since not having had that power\r\nnor instruction to conclude it it is clearly null and of no value.\r\n\r\nI repeat to you, sir, the sentiments of my distinguished consideration,\r\nand pray God that you live many years.\r\n\r\nJOAQUIN DE ANDUAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Don Joaquin de Anduaga to the Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, _April 26, 1822_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS,\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I have received your note of the 15th instant, in which you are\r\npleased to communicate to me the reasons which induce the President\r\nnot only to refuse to His Catholic Majesty the satisfaction which he\r\ndemanded in his royal name for the insults offered by General Jackson\r\nto the Spanish commissaries and officers, but to approve fully of the\r\nsaid chief's conduct.\r\n\r\nBefore answering the contents of the said note I thought it my duty to\r\nrequest instructions from my Government, and therefore without delay I\r\nhave laid it before them. Until they arrive, therefore, I have confined\r\nmyself to two observations:\r\n\r\nFirst. If in my note of the 18th of November last I said that as General\r\nJackson had not specified the actions which had induced him to declare\r\nthe Spanish officers expelled from the Floridas criminal, nor given\r\nproof of them, I thought myself authorized to declare the accusation\r\nfalse, I did not this through inadvertency, but upon the evident\r\nprinciple that every person accused has a right to declare an accusation\r\ndestitute of proof false, and, much more, an accusation not pretended\r\nto be proved. This assertion of mine does not presume that I am not\r\npersuaded of the merit of the said General and of the claim which he has\r\nupon the gratitude of his country; but although it is believed the duty\r\nof his country to eulogize and reward his eminent services, yet it will\r\nbe lawful for the representative of a power outraged by him to complain\r\nof his conduct. I can not persuade myself that to aggravate my said\r\nexpression you could have thought that I had been wanting in due\r\nrespect, it not being possible for that opinion to have entered your\r\nmind, when by his orders Mr. Forsyth had sent to the Spanish minister\r\non the 1st of September last a note, in which, complaining of the\r\nCaptain-General of the island of Cuba, he accuses him of dishonorable\r\npecuniary motives in not having delivered the archives, without giving\r\nany proof of so injurious an assertion; and I must remark that the rank\r\nof General Mabry in Spain is at least as elevated as that of General\r\nJackson in the United States, and that the services performed by him to\r\nhis country have rendered him as worthy as he of its consideration and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nSecond. Although you are pleased to tell me that part of the papers\r\ntaken from Colonel Coppinger are ready to be delivered, which the\r\nAmerican commissioners, _after having examined them_, have adjudged to\r\nbe returned to Spain, I do not think myself authorized to admit their\r\nreturn in this manner, but in the mode which I demanded in my note of\r\nthe 22d of November last.\r\n\r\nAs I have seen by the public papers that the President has communicated\r\nto Congress the note which you were pleased to address to me, dated\r\nthe 15th instant, and that it has been ordered to be printed, I take\r\nthe liberty of requesting that you will have the goodness to use your\r\ninfluence that this my answer may be treated in the same manner, that\r\nCongress and the public may be informed that if I have not answered the\r\nfirst part of it as respects the general business, it is only to wait\r\nfor the instructions of my Government, but that I have answered what\r\nwas personal.\r\n\r\nI renew to you, sir, the sentiments of my distinguished consideration.\r\n\r\nJOAQUIN DE ANDUAGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 6, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 26th of April,\r\nrequesting the President of the United States \"to communicate to the\r\nSenate the report of the Attorney-General relative to any persons\r\n(citizens of the United States) who have been charged with or suspected\r\nof introducing any slaves into the United States contrary to existing\r\nlaws,\" I transmit herewith two reports from the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 7, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 25th of April,\r\nrequesting certain information concerning lead mines on lands of the\r\nUnited States, I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 7, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n23d of April, requesting the President of the United States to cause to\r\nbe communicated to that House certain information respecting the lead\r\nmines of the State of Missouri, I herewith transmit a report of the\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 7, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 7th of May, requesting the President to communicate to that House\r\na letter of Jonathan Russell, esq., referred to in his message of the\r\n4th instant, together with such communications as he may have received\r\nrelative thereto from any of the other ministers of the United States\r\nwho negotiated the treaty of Ghent, I herewith transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of State, with the documents called for by that\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 4, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nHaving duly considered the bill entitled \"An act for the preservation\r\nand repair of the Cumberland road,\" it is with deep regret, approving\r\nas I do the policy, that I am compelled to object to its passage and to\r\nreturn the bill to the House of Representatives, in which it originated,\r\nunder a conviction that Congress do not possess the power under the\r\nConstitution to pass such a law.\r\n\r\nA power to establish turnpikes with gates and tolls, and to enforce the\r\ncollection of tolls by penalties, implies a power to adopt and execute a\r\ncomplete system of internal improvement. A right to impose duties to be\r\npaid by all persons passing a certain road, and on horses and carriages,\r\nas is done by this bill, involves the right to take the land from the\r\nproprietor on a valuation and to pass laws for the protection of the\r\nroad from injuries, and if it exist as to one road it exists as to any\r\nother, and to as many roads as Congress may think proper to establish.\r\nA right to legislate for one of these purposes is a right to legislate\r\nfor the others. It is a complete right of jurisdiction and sovereignty\r\nfor all the purposes of internal improvement, and not merely the\r\nright of applying money under the power vested in Congress to make\r\nappropriations, under which power, with the consent of the States\r\nthrough which this road passes, the work was originally commenced, and\r\nhas been so far executed. I am of opinion that Congress do not possess\r\nthis power; that the States individually can not grant it, for although\r\nthey may assent to the appropriation of money within their limits for\r\nsuch purposes, they can grant no power of jurisdiction or sovereignty by\r\nspecial compacts with the United States. This power can be granted only\r\nby an amendment to the Constitution and in the mode prescribed by it.\r\n\r\nIf the power exist, it must be either because it has been specifically\r\ngranted to the United States or that it is incidental to some power\r\nwhich has been specifically granted. If we examine the specific grants\r\nof power we do not find it among them, nor is it incidental to any power\r\nwhich has been specifically granted.\r\n\r\nIt has never been contended that the power was specifically granted.\r\nIt is claimed only as being incidental to some one or more of the powers\r\nwhich are specifically granted. The following are the powers from which\r\nit is said to be derived:\r\n\r\nFirst, from the right to establish post-offices and post-roads; second,\r\nfrom the right to declare war; third, to regulate commerce; fourth,\r\nto pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare;\r\nfifth, from the power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying\r\ninto execution all the powers vested by the Constitution in the\r\nGovernment of the United States or in any department or officer thereof;\r\nsixth and lastly, from the power to dispose of and make all needful\r\nrules and regulations respecting the territory and other property of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAccording to my judgment it can not be derived from either of those\r\npowers, nor from all of them united, and in consequence it does not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\nHaving stated my objections to the bill, I should now cheerfully\r\ncommunicate at large the reasons on which they are founded if I had\r\ntime to reduce them to such form as to include them in this paper. The\r\nadvanced stage of the session renders that impossible. Having at the\r\ncommencement of my service in this high trust considered it a duty to\r\nexpress the opinion that the United States do not possess the power in\r\nquestion, and to suggest for the consideration of Congress the propriety\r\nof recommending to the States an amendment to the Constitution to vest\r\nthe power in the United States, my attention has been often drawn to the\r\nsubject since, in consequence whereof I have occasionally committed my\r\nsentiments to paper respecting it. The form which this exposition has\r\nassumed is not such as I should have given it had it been intended for\r\nCongress, nor is it concluded. Nevertheless, as it contains my views\r\non this subject, being one which I deem of very high importance, and\r\nwhich in many of its bearings has now become peculiarly urgent, I will\r\ncommunicate it to Congress, if in my power, in the course of the day,\r\nor certainly on Monday next.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 4, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit the paper alluded to in the message of this day, on the\r\nsubject of internal improvements.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIEWS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ON THE SUBJECT OF INTERNAL\r\nIMPROVEMENTS.\r\n\r\nIt may be presumed that the proposition relating to internal\r\nimprovements by roads and canals, which has been several times before\r\nCongress, will be taken into consideration again either for the purpose\r\nof recommending to the States the adoption of an amendment to the\r\nConstitution to vest the necessary power in the General Government or\r\nto carry the system into effect on the principle that the power has\r\nalready been granted. It seems to be the prevailing opinion that great\r\nadvantage would be derived from the exercise of such a power by Congress.\r\nRespecting the right there is much diversity of sentiment. It is of the\r\nhighest importance that this question should be settled. If the right\r\nexist, it ought forthwith to be exercised. If it does not exist, surely\r\nthose who are friends to the power ought to unite in recommending an\r\namendment to the Constitution to obtain it. I propose to examine this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry confined to its proper objects and within the most limited\r\nscale is extensive. Our Government is unlike other governments both in\r\nits origin and form. In analyzing it the differences in certain respects\r\nbetween it and those of other nations, ancient and modern, necessarily\r\ncome into view. I propose to notice these differences so far as they are\r\nconnected with the object of inquiry, and the consequences likely to\r\nresult from them, varying in equal degree from those which have attended\r\nother governments. The digression, if it may be so called, will in every\r\ninstance be short and the transition to the main object immediate and\r\ndirect.\r\n\r\nTo do justice to the subject it will be necessary to mount to the source\r\nof power in these States and to pursue this power in its gradations and\r\ndistribution among the several departments in which it is now vested.\r\nThe great division is between the State governments and the General\r\nGovernment. If there was a perfect accord in every instance as to\r\nthe precise extent of the powers granted to the General Government,\r\nwe should then know with equal certainty what were the powers which\r\nremained to the State governments, since it would follow that those\r\nwhich were not granted to the one would remain to the other. But it is\r\non this point, and particularly respecting the construction of these\r\npowers and their incidents, that a difference of opinion exists, and\r\nhence it is necessary to trace distinctly the origin of each government,\r\nthe purposes intended by it, and the means adopted to accomplish them.\r\nBy having the interior of both governments fully before us we shall have\r\nall the means which can be afforded to enable us to form a correct\r\nopinion of the endowments of each.\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution the present States, then colonies, were separate\r\ncommunities, unconnected with each other except in their common relation\r\nto the Crown. Their governments were instituted by grants from the\r\nCrown, which operated, according to the conditions of each grant, in\r\nthe nature of a compact between the settlers in each colony and the\r\nCrown. All power not retained in the Crown was vested exclusively in\r\nthe colonies, each having a government consisting of an executive, a\r\njudiciary, and a legislative assembly, one branch of which was in every\r\ninstance elected by the people. No office was hereditary, nor did any\r\ntitle under the Crown give rank or office in any of the colonies. In\r\nresisting the encroachments of the parent country and abrogating the\r\npower of the Crown the authority which had been held by it vested\r\nexclusively in the people of the colonies, By them was a Congress\r\nappointed, composed of delegates from each colony, who managed the war,\r\ndeclared independence, treated with foreign powers, and acted in all\r\nthings according to the sense of their constituents. The Declaration of\r\nIndependence confirmed in form what had before existed in substance.\r\nIt announced to the world new States, possessing and exercising complete\r\nsovereignty, which they were resolved to maintain. They were soon after\r\nrecognized by France and other powers, and finally by Great Britain\r\nherself in 1783.\r\n\r\nSoon after the power of the Crown was annulled the people of each\r\ncolony established a constitution or frame of government for themselves,\r\nin which these separate branches--legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary--were instituted, each independent of the others. To these\r\nbranches, each having its appropriate portion, the whole power of the\r\npeople not delegated to Congress was communicated, to be exercised for\r\ntheir advantage on the representative principle by persons of their\r\nappointment, or otherwise deriving their authority immediately from\r\nthem, and holding their offices for stated terms. All the powers\r\nnecessary for useful purposes held by any of the strongest governments\r\nof the Old World not vested in Congress were imparted to these State\r\ngovernments without other checks than such as are necessary to prevent\r\nabuse, in the form of fundamental declarations or bills of right. The\r\ngreat difference between our governments and those of the Old World\r\nconsists in this, that the former, being representative, the persons who\r\nexercise their powers do it not for themselves or in their own right,\r\nbut for the people, and therefore while they are in the highest degree\r\nefficient they can never become oppressive. It is this transfer of\r\nthe power of the people to representative and responsible bodies in\r\nevery branch which constitutes the great improvement in the science\r\nof government and forms the boast of our system. It combines all the\r\nadvantages of every known government without any of their disadvantages.\r\nIt retains the sovereignty in the people, while it avoids the tumult\r\nand disorder incident to the exercise of that power by the people\r\nthemselves. It possesses all the energy and efficiency of the most\r\ndespotic governments, while it avoids all the oppressions and abuses\r\ninseparable from those governments.\r\n\r\nIn every stage of the conflict from its commencement until March,\r\n1781, the powers of Congress were undefined, but of vast extent.\r\nThe assemblies or conventions of the several colonies being formed by\r\nrepresentatives from every county in each colony and the Congress by\r\ndelegates from each colonial assembly, the powers of the latter for\r\ngeneral purposes resembled those of the former for local. They rested\r\non the same basis, the people, and were complete for all the purposes\r\ncontemplated. Never was a movement so spontaneous, so patriotic, so\r\nefficient. The nation exerted its whole faculties in support of its\r\nrights, and of its independence after the contest took that direction,\r\nand it succeeded. It was, however, foreseen at a very early stage\r\nthat although the patriotism of the country might be relied on in\r\nthe struggle for its independence, a well-digested compact would be\r\nnecessary to preserve it after obtained. A plan of confederation was\r\nin consequence proposed and taken into consideration by Congress even\r\nat the moment when the other great act which severed them from Great\r\nBritain and declared their independence was proclaimed to the world.\r\nThis compact was ratified on the 21st March, 1781, by the last State,\r\nand thereupon carried into immediate effect.\r\n\r\nThe following powers were vested in the United States by the Articles\r\nof Confederation. As this, the first bond of union, was in operation\r\nnearly eight years, during which time a practical construction was given\r\nto many of its powers, all of which were adopted in the Constitution\r\nwith important additions, it is thought that a correct view of those\r\npowers and of the manner in which they are executed may shed light on\r\nthe subject under consideration. It may fairly be presumed that where\r\ncertain powers were transferred from one instrument to the other and\r\nin the same terms, or terms descriptive only of the same powers, that\r\nit was intended that they should be construed in the same sense in\r\nthe latter that they were in the former.\r\n\r\nArticle I declares that the style of the Confederacy shall be \"The\r\nUnited States of America.\"\r\n\r\nArticle II. Each State retains its sovereignty, freedom, and\r\nindependence, and every power and right which is not expressly delegated\r\nto the United States.\r\n\r\nArticle III. The States severally enter into a firm league of friendship\r\nwith each other for their common defense, the security of their\r\nliberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves\r\nto assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon\r\nthem on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, etc.\r\n\r\nArticle IV. The free inhabitants of each State, paupers, vagabonds, and\r\nfugitives from justice excepted, shall be entitled to all the privileges\r\nand immunities of free citizens in the several States, etc. Fugitives\r\nfrom justice into any of the States shall be delivered up on the demand\r\nof the executive of the State from which they fled. Full faith and\r\ncredit shall be given in each State to the records and acts of every\r\nother State.\r\n\r\nArticle V. Delegates shall be annually appointed by the legislature of\r\neach State to meet in Congress on the first Monday in November, with a\r\npower to recall, etc. No State shall appoint less than two nor more than\r\nseven, nor shall any delegate hold his office for more than three in six\r\nyears. Each State shall maintain its own delegates. Each State shall\r\nhave one vote. Freedom of speech shall not be impeached, and the members\r\nshall be protected from arrests, except for treason, etc.\r\n\r\nArticle VI. No State shall send or receive an embassy or enter into a\r\ntreaty with a foreign power. Nor shall any person holding any office of\r\nprofit or trust under the United States or any State accept any present,\r\nemolument, office, or title from a foreign power. Nor shall the United\r\nStates or any State grant any title of nobility. No two States shall\r\nenter into any treaty without the consent of Congress. No State shall\r\nlay any imposts or duties which may interfere with any treaties entered\r\ninto by the United States. No State shall engage in war unless it be\r\ninvaded or menaced with invasion by some Indian tribe, nor grant letters\r\nof marque or reprisal unless it be against pirates, nor keep up vessels\r\nof war nor any body of troops in time of peace without the consent of\r\nCongress; but every State shall keep up a well regulated militia, etc.\r\n\r\nArticle VII. When land forces are raised by any State for the common\r\ndefense, all officers of and under the rank of colonel shall be\r\nappointed by the legislature of each State.\r\n\r\nArticle VIII. All charges of war and all other expenses which shall be\r\nincurred for the common defense or general welfare shall be defrayed\r\nout of a common treasury, which shall be supplied by the several\r\nStates in proportion to the value of all the land in each State\r\ngranted to individuals. The taxes for paying each proportion shall\r\nbe levied by the several States.\r\n\r\nArticle IX. Congress shall have the sole and exclusive right and power\r\nof determining on peace and war, except in the cases mentioned in\r\nthe sixth article; of sending and receiving ambassadors; entering\r\ninto alliances, except, etc.; of establishing rules for deciding what\r\ncaptures on land and water shall be legal; of granting letters of marque\r\nand reprisal in time of peace; appointing courts for the trial of\r\npiracies and felonies on the high seas; for deciding controversies\r\nbetween the States and between individuals claiming lands under two or\r\nmore States whose jurisdiction has been adjusted; of regulating the\r\nalloy and value of coin struck by their authority and of foreign coin;\r\nfixing the standard of weights and measures; regulating the trade with\r\nthe Indians; establishing and regulating post offices from one State to\r\nanother and throughout all the States, and exacting such postage as may\r\nbe requisite to defray the expenses of the office; of appointing all\r\nofficers of the land forces except the regimental; appointing all the\r\nofficers of the naval forces; to ascertain the necessary sums of money\r\nto be raised for the service of the United States and appropriate the\r\nsame; to borrow money and emit bills of credit; to build and equip a\r\nNavy; to agree on the number of land forces and to make requisitions\r\non each State for its quota; that the assent of nine States shall be\r\nrequisite to these great acts.\r\n\r\nArticle X regulates the powers of the committee of the States to sit in\r\nthe recess of Congress.\r\n\r\nArticle XI provides for the admission of Canada into the Confederation.\r\n\r\nArticle XII pledges the faith of the United States for the payment of\r\nall bills of credit issued and money borrowed on their account.\r\n\r\nArticle XIII. Every State shall abide by the determination of the United\r\nStates on all questions submitted to them by the Confederation, the\r\nArticles of the Confederation to be perpetual and not to be altered\r\nwithout the consent of every State.\r\n\r\nThis bond of union was soon found to be utterly incompetent to the\r\npurposes intended by it. It was defective in its powers; it was\r\ndefective also in the means of executing the powers actually granted by\r\nit. Being a league of sovereign and independent States, its acts, like\r\nthose of all other leagues, required the interposition of the States\r\ncomposing it to give them effect within their respective jurisdictions.\r\nThe acts of Congress without the aid of State laws to enforce them were\r\naltogether nugatory. The refusal or omission of one State to pass such\r\nlaws was urged as a reason to justify like conduct in others, and thus\r\nthe Government was soon at a stand.\r\n\r\nThe experience of a few years demonstrated that the Confederation could\r\nnot be relied on for the security of the blessings which had been\r\nderived from the Revolution. The interests of the nation required\r\na more efficient Government, which the good sense and virtue of the\r\npeople provided by the adoption of the present Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States was formed by a convention of\r\ndelegates from the several States, who met in Philadelphia, duly\r\nauthorized for the purpose, and it was ratified by a convention in each\r\nState which was especially called to consider and decide on the same.\r\nIn this progress the State governments were never suspended in their\r\nfunctions. On the contrary, they took the lead in it. Conscious of their\r\nincompetency to secure to the Union the blessings of the Revolution,\r\nthey promoted the diminution of their own powers and the enlargement of\r\nthose of the General Government in the way in which they might be most\r\nadequate and efficient. It is believed that no other example can be\r\nfound of a Government exerting its influence to lessen its own powers,\r\nof a policy so enlightened, of a patriotism so pure and disinterested.\r\nThe credit, however, is more especially due to the people of each State,\r\nin obedience to whose will and under whose control the State governments\r\nacted.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States, being ratified by the people of\r\nthe several States, became of necessity to the extent of its powers the\r\nparamount authority of the Union. On sound principles it can be viewed\r\nin no other light. The people, the highest authority known to our\r\nsystem, from whom all our institutions spring and on whom they depend,\r\nformed it. Had the people of the several States thought proper to\r\nincorporate themselves into one community, under one government, they\r\nmight have done it. They had the power, and there was nothing then nor\r\nis there anything now, should they be so disposed, to prevent it. They\r\nwisely stopped, however, at a certain point, extending the incorporation\r\nto that point, making the National Government thus far a consolidated\r\nGovernment, and preserving the State governments without that limit\r\nperfectly sovereign and independent of the National Government. Had the\r\npeople of the several States incorporated themselves into one community,\r\nthey must have remained such, their Constitution becoming then, like the\r\nconstitution of the several States, incapable of change until altered\r\nby the will of the majority. In the institution of a State government\r\nby the citizens of a State a compact is formed to which all and every\r\ncitizen are equal parties. They are also the sole parties and may amend\r\nit at pleasure. In the institution of the Government of the United\r\nStates by the citizens of every State a compact was formed between the\r\nwhole American people which has the same force and partakes of all the\r\nqualities to the extent of its powers as a compact between the citizens\r\nof a State in the formation of their own constitution. It can not be\r\naltered except by those who formed it or in the mode prescribed by the\r\nparties to the compact itself.\r\n\r\nThis Constitution was adopted for the purpose of remedying all\r\ndefects of the Confederation, and in this it has succeeded beyond\r\nany calculation that could have been formed of any human institution.\r\nBy binding the States together the Constitution performs the great\r\noffice of the Confederation; but it is in that sense only that it has\r\nany of the properties of that compact, and in that it is more effectual\r\nto the purpose, as it holds them together by a much stronger bond; and\r\nin all other respects in which the Confederation failed the Constitution\r\nhas been blessed with complete success. The Confederation was a compact\r\nbetween separate and independent States, the execution of whose\r\narticles in the powers which operated internally depended on the State\r\ngovernments. But the great office of the Constitution, by incorporating\r\nthe people of the several States to the extent of its powers into one\r\ncommunity and enabling it to act directly on the people, was to annul\r\nthe powers of the State governments to that extent, except in cases\r\nwhere they were concurrent, and to preclude their agency in giving\r\neffect to those of the General Government. The Government of the United\r\nStates relies on its own means for the execution of its powers, as the\r\nState governments do for the execution of theirs, both governments\r\nhaving a common origin or sovereign, the people--the State governments\r\nthe people of each State, the National Government the people of every\r\nState--and being amenable to the power which created it. It is by\r\nexecuting its functions as a Government thus originating and thus acting\r\nthat the Constitution of the United States holds the States together and\r\nperforms the office of a league. It is owing to the nature of its powers\r\nand the high source from whence they are derived--the people--that it\r\nperforms that office better than the Confederation or any league which\r\never existed, being a compact which the State governments did not form,\r\nto which they are not parties, and which executes its own powers\r\nindependently of them.\r\n\r\nThere were two separate and independent governments established over\r\nour Union, one for local purposes over each State by the people of\r\nthe State, the other for national purposes over all the States by\r\nthe people of the United States. The whole power of the people, on the\r\nrepresentative principle, is divided between them. The State governments\r\nare independent of each other, and to the extent of their powers are\r\ncomplete sovereignties. The National Government begins where the State\r\ngovernments terminate, except in some instances where there is a\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction between them. This Government is also, according\r\nto the extent of its powers, a complete sovereignty. I speak here, as\r\nrepeatedly mentioned before, altogether of representative sovereignties,\r\nfor the real sovereignty is in the people alone.\r\n\r\nThe history of the world affords no such example of two separate and\r\nindependent governments established over the same people, nor can it\r\nexist except in governments founded on the sovereignty of the people.\r\nIn monarchies and other governments not representative there can be no\r\nsuch division of power. The government is inherent in the possessor;\r\nit is his, and can not be taken from him without a revolution. In such\r\ngovernments alliances and leagues alone are practicable. But with us\r\nindividuals count for nothing in the offices which they hold; that\r\nis, they have no right to them. They hold them as representatives, by\r\nappointment from the people, in whom the sovereignty is exclusively\r\nvested. It is impossible to speak too highly of this system taken\r\nin its twofold character and in all its great principles of two\r\ngovernments, completely distinct from and independent of each other,\r\neach constitutional, founded by and acting directly on the people, each\r\ncompetent to all its purposes, administering all the blessings for which\r\nit was instituted, without even the most remote danger of exercising\r\nany of its powers in a way to oppress the people. A system capable\r\nof expansion over a vast territory not only without weakening either\r\ngovernment, but enjoying the peculiar advantage of adding thereby new\r\nstrength and vigor to the faculties of both; possessing also this\r\nadditional advantage, that while the several States enjoy all the rights\r\nreserved to them of separate and independent governments, and each is\r\nsecured by the nature of the Federal Government, which acts directly on\r\nthe people, against the failure of the others to bear their equal share\r\nof the public burdens, and thereby enjoys in a more perfect degree all\r\nthe advantages of a league, it holds them together by a bond altogether\r\ndifferent and much stronger than the late Confederation or any league\r\nthat was ever known before--a bond beyond their control, and which can\r\nnot even be amended except in the mode prescribed by it. So great an\r\neffort in favor of human happiness was never made before; but it became\r\nthose who made it. Established in the new hemisphere, descended from the\r\nsame ancestors, speaking the same language, having the same religion and\r\nuniversal toleration, born equal and educated in the same principles of\r\nfree government, made independent by a common struggle and menaced by\r\nthe same dangers, ties existed between them which never applied before\r\nto separate communities. They had every motive to bind them together\r\nwhich could operate on the interests and affections of a generous,\r\nenlightened, and virtuous people, and it affords inexpressible\r\nconsolation to find that these motives had their merited influence.\r\n\r\nIn thus tracing our institutions to their origin and pursuing them\r\nin their progress and modifications down to the adoption of this\r\nConstitution two important facts have been disclosed, on which it may\r\nnot be improper in this stage to make a few observations. The first is\r\nthat in wresting the power, or what is called the sovereignty, from\r\nthe Crown it passed directly to the people. The second, that it passed\r\ndirectly to the people of each colony and not to the people of all the\r\ncolonies in the aggregate; to thirteen distinct communities and not\r\nto one. To these two facts, each contributing its equal proportion,\r\nI am inclined to think that we are in an eminent degree indebted for\r\nthe success of our Revolution. By passing to the people it vested in\r\na community every individual of which had equal rights and a common\r\ninterest. There was no family dethroned among us, no banished pretender\r\nin a foreign country looking back to his connections and adherents here\r\nin the hope of a recall; no order of nobility whose hereditary rights in\r\nthe Government had been violated; no hierarchy which had been degraded\r\nand oppressed. There was but one order, that of the people, by whom\r\neverything was gained by the change. I mention it also as a circumstance\r\nof peculiar felicity that the great body of the people had been born\r\nand educated under these equal and original institutions. Their habits,\r\ntheir principles, and their prejudices were therefore all on the side\r\nof the Revolution and of free republican government.\r\n\r\nHad distinct orders existed, our fortune might and probably would have\r\nbeen different. It would scarcely have been possible to have united so\r\ncompletely the whole force of the country against a common enemy. A\r\ncontest would probably have arisen in the outset between the orders for\r\nthe control. Had the aristocracy prevailed, the people would have been\r\nheartless. Had the people prevailed, the nobility would probably have\r\nleft the country, or, remaining behind, internal divisions would have\r\ntaken place in every State and a civil war broken out more destructive\r\neven than the foreign, which might have defeated the whole movement.\r\nAncient and modern history is replete with examples proceeding from\r\nconflicts between distinct orders, of revolutions attempted which proved\r\nabortive, of republics which have terminated in despotism. It is owing\r\nto the simplicity of the elements of which our system is composed that\r\nthe attraction of all the parts has been to a common center, that every\r\nchange has tended to cement the union, and, in short, that we have been\r\nblessed with such glorious and happy success.\r\n\r\nAnd that the power wrested from the British Crown passed to the people\r\nof each colony the whole history of our political movement from the\r\nemigration of our ancestors to the present day clearly demonstrates.\r\nWhat produced the Revolution? The violation of our rights. What rights?\r\nOur chartered rights. To whom were the charters granted, to the people\r\nof each colony or to the people of all the colonies as a single\r\ncommunity? We know that no such community as the aggregate existed,\r\nand of course that no such rights could be violated. It may be added\r\nthat the nature of the powers which were given to the delegates by\r\neach colony and the manner in which they were executed show that the\r\nsovereignty was in the people of each and not in the aggregate. They\r\nrespectively presented credentials such as are usual between ministers\r\nof separate powers, which were examined and approved before they entered\r\non the discharge of the important duties committed to them. They voted\r\nalso by colonies and not individually, all the members from one colony\r\nbeing entitled to one vote only. This fact alone, the first of our\r\npolitical association and at the period of our greatest peril, fixes\r\nbeyond all controversy the source from whence the power which has\r\ndirected and secured success to all our measures has proceeded.\r\n\r\nHad the sovereignty passed to the aggregate, consequences might have\r\nensued, admitting the success of our Revolution, which might even yet\r\nseriously affect our system. By passing to the people of each colony\r\nthe opposition to Great Britain, the prosecution of the war, the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, the adoption of the Confederation and\r\nof this Constitution are all imputable to them. Had it passed to the\r\naggregate, every measure would be traced to that source; even the State\r\ngovernments might be said to have emanated from it, and amendments of\r\ntheir constitutions on that principle be proposed by the same authority.\r\nIn short it is not easy to perceive all the consequences into which such\r\na doctrine might lead. It is obvious that the people in mass would have\r\nhad much less agency in all the great measures of the Revolution and in\r\nthose which followed than they actually had, and proportionably less\r\ncredit for their patriotism and services than they are now entitled to\r\nand enjoy. By passing to the people of each colony the whole body in\r\neach were kept in constant and active deliberation on subjects of the\r\nhighest national importance and in the supervision of the conduct of all\r\nthe public servants in the discharge of their respective duties. Thus\r\nthe most effectual guards were provided against abuses and dangers of\r\nevery kind which human ingenuity could devise, and the whole people\r\nrendered more competent to the self-government which by an heroic\r\nexertion they had acquired.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to examine the powers of the General Government,\r\nwhich, like the governments of the several States, is divided into three\r\nbranches--a legislative, executive, and judiciary--each having its\r\nappropriate share. Of these the legislative, from the nature of its\r\npowers, all laws proceeding from it, and the manner of its appointment,\r\nits members being elected immediately by the people, is by far the most\r\nimportant. The whole system of the National Government may be said to\r\nrest essentially on the powers granted to this branch. They mark the\r\nlimit within which, with few exceptions, all the branches must move\r\nin the discharge of their respective functions. It will be proper,\r\ntherefore, to take a full and correct view of the powers granted to it.\r\n\r\nBy the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution it is\r\ndeclared that Congress shall have power--\r\n\r\nFirst. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay\r\nthe debts, and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the\r\nUnited States;\r\n\r\nSecond. To borrow money;\r\n\r\nThird. To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several\r\nStates, and with the Indian tribes;\r\n\r\nFourth. To establish an uniform rule of naturalization and uniform laws\r\nrespecting bankruptcies;\r\n\r\nFifth. To coin money, regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin,\r\nand fix the standard of weights and measures;\r\n\r\nSixth. To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities\r\nand current coin of the United States;\r\n\r\nSeventh. To establish post offices and post-roads;\r\n\r\nEighth. To promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing\r\nfor limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their\r\nrespective writings and discoveries;\r\n\r\nNinth. To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court, to define\r\nand punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and\r\noffenses against the laws of nations;\r\n\r\nTenth. To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make\r\nrules concerning captures on land and water;\r\n\r\nEleventh. To raise and support armies;\r\n\r\nTwelfth. To provide and maintain a navy;\r\n\r\nThirteenth. To make rules for the government of the land and naval\r\nforces;\r\n\r\nFourteenth. To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws\r\nof the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions;\r\n\r\nFifteenth. To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the\r\nmilitia, and for governing such part of them as may be in the service\r\nof the United States, reserving to the States the appointment of the\r\nofficers and the authority of training the militia according to the\r\ndiscipline prescribed by Congress;\r\n\r\nSixteenth. To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatever over\r\nsuch district (not exceeding 10 miles square) as may, by the cession of\r\nparticular States and the acceptance of by Congress, become the seat of\r\nGovernment of the United States; and to exercise like authority over all\r\nplaces purchased, by the consent of the legislature of the State in\r\nwhich the same may be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,\r\ndockyards, and other needful buildings;\r\n\r\nSeventeenth. And to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper\r\nfor carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers\r\nvested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States or\r\nin any department or officer thereof.\r\n\r\nTo the other branches of the Government the powers properly belonging to\r\neach are granted. The President, in whom the executive power is vested,\r\nis made commander in chief of the Army and Navy, and militia when called\r\ninto the service of the United States. He is authorized, with the advice\r\nand consent of the Senate, two-thirds of the members present concurring,\r\nto form treaties, to nominate and, with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, to appoint ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls,\r\njudges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers whose appointments\r\nare not otherwise provided for by law. He has power to grant reprieves\r\nand pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases\r\nof impeachment. It is made his duty to give to Congress from time to\r\ntime information of the state of the Union, to recommend to their\r\nconsideration such measures as he may judge necessary and expedient, to\r\nconvene both Houses on extraordinary occasions, to receive ambassadors,\r\nand to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\r\n\r\nThe judicial power is vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior\r\ncourts as Congress may establish; and it is made to extend to all cases\r\nin law and equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of the\r\nUnited States, and treaties made under their authority. Cases affecting\r\nambassadors and other public characters, cases of admiralty and maritime\r\njurisdiction, causes in which the United States are a party, between two\r\nor more States, between citizens of different States, between citizens\r\nof the same State claiming grants of land under different States,\r\nbetween a State or the citizens thereof and foreign States, are\r\nspecially assigned to these tribunals.\r\n\r\nOther powers have been granted in other parts of the Constitution which,\r\nalthough they relate to specific objects, unconnected with the ordinary\r\nadministration, yet, as they form important features in the Government\r\nand may shed useful light on the construction which ought to be given\r\nto the powers above enumerated, it is proper to bring into view.\r\n\r\nBy Article I, section 9, clause 1, it is provided that the migration\r\nor importation of such persons as any of the States now existing shall\r\nthink proper to admit shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the\r\nyear 1808, but a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation not\r\nexceeding $10 for each person.\r\n\r\nBy Article III, section 3, clause 1, new States may be admitted by\r\nCongress into the Union, but that no new State shall be formed within\r\nthe jurisdiction of another State, nor any State be formed by the\r\njunction of two or more States or parts of States without the consent of\r\nthe legislature of the States concerned as well as of the United States.\r\nAnd by the next clause of the same article and section power is vested\r\nin Congress to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations\r\nrespecting the territory or other property belonging to the United.\r\nStates, with a proviso that nothing in the Constitution shall be so\r\nconstrued as to prejudice any claims of the United States or of any\r\nparticular State.\r\n\r\nBy Article IV, section 4, the United States guarantee to every State a\r\nrepublican form of government and engage to protect each of them against\r\ninvasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive\r\nwhen the legislature can not be convened, against domestic violence.\r\n\r\nOf the other parts of the Constitution relating to power, some form\r\nrestraints on the exercise of the powers granted to Congress and others\r\non the exercise of the powers remaining to the States. The object in\r\nboth instances is to draw more completely the line between the two\r\ngovernments and also to prevent abuses by either. Other parts operate\r\nlike conventional stipulations between the States, abolishing between\r\nthem all distinctions applicable to foreign powers and securing to the\r\ninhabitants of each State all the rights and immunities of citizens in\r\nthe several States.\r\n\r\nBy the fifth article it is provided that Congress, whenever two-thirds\r\nof both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments, or, on\r\nthe application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several States,\r\nshall call a convention for proposing amendments, which in either case\r\nshall be valid as a part of the Constitution when ratified by the\r\nlegislatures of three-fourths of the several States, or by conventions\r\nin three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode may be proposed\r\nby Congress: _Provided_, That no State, without its consent, shall be\r\ndeprived of its equal vote in the Senate, and that no amendment which\r\nmay be made prior to the year 1808 shall affect the first and fourth\r\nclauses in the ninth section of the first article.\r\n\r\nBy the second section of the sixth article it is declared that the\r\nConstitution, and laws of the United States which shall be made in\r\npursuance thereof, and all treaties made under the authority of the\r\nUnited States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and that the judges\r\nin every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or\r\nlaws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. This right in the\r\nNational Government to execute its powers was indispensable to its\r\nexistence. If the State governments had not been restrained from\r\nencroaching on the powers vested in the National Government, the\r\nConstitution, like the Confederation, would soon have been set at\r\nnaught; and it was not within the limit of the human mind to devise\r\nany plan for the accomplishment of the object other than by making a\r\nnational constitution which should be to the extent of its powers the\r\nsupreme law of the land. This right in the National Government would\r\nhave existed under the Constitution to the full extent provided for by\r\nthis declaration had it not been made. To prevent the possibility of\r\na doubt, however, on so important a subject it was proper to make the\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\nHaving presented above a full view of all the powers granted to the\r\nUnited States, it will be proper to look to those remaining to the\r\nStates. It is by fixing the great powers which are admitted to belong\r\nto each government that we may hope to come to a right conclusion\r\nrespecting those in controversy between them. In regard to the National\r\nGovernment, this task was easy because its powers were to be found in\r\nspecific grants in the Constitution; but it is more difficult to give a\r\ndetail of the powers of the State governments, as their constitutions,\r\ncontaining all powers granted by the people not specifically taken\r\nfrom them by grants to the United States, can not well be enumerated.\r\nFortunately, a precise detail of all the powers remaining to the State\r\ngovernments is not necessary in the present instance. A knowledge of\r\ntheir great powers only will answer every purpose contemplated, and\r\nrespecting these there can be no diversity in opinion. They are\r\nsufficiently recognized and established by the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States itself. In designating the important powers of the\r\nState governments it is proper to observe, first, that the territory\r\ncontemplated by the Constitution belongs to each State in its separate\r\ncharacter and not to the United States in their aggregate character.\r\nBach State holds territory according to its original charter, except in\r\ncases where cessions have been made to the United States by individual\r\nStates. The United States had none when the Constitution was adopted\r\nwhich had not been thus ceded to them and which they held on the\r\nconditions on which such cession had been made. Within the individual\r\nStates it is believed that they held not a single acre; but if they did\r\nit was as citizens held it, merely as private property. The territory\r\nacquired by cession lying without the individual States rests on a\r\ndifferent principle, and is provided for by a separate and distinct part\r\nof the Constitution. It is the territory within the individual States to\r\nwhich the Constitution in its great principles applies, and it applies\r\nto such territory as the territory of a State and not as that of the\r\nUnited States. The next circumstance to be attended to is that the\r\npeople composing this Union are the people of the several States, and\r\nnot of the United States in the full sense of a consolidated government.\r\nThe militia are the militia of the several States; lands are held under\r\nthe laws of the States; descents, contracts, and all the concerns of\r\nprivate property, the administration of justice, and the whole criminal\r\ncode, except in the cases of breaches of the laws of the United States\r\nmade under and in conformity with the powers vested in Congress and of\r\nthe laws of nations, are regulated by State laws. This enumeration shows\r\nthe great extent of the powers of the State governments. The territory\r\nand the people form the basis on which all governments are founded.\r\nThe militia constitutes their effective force. The regulation and\r\nprotection of property and of personal liberty are also among the\r\nhighest attributes of sovereignty. This, without other evidence, is\r\nsufficient to show that the great office of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States is to unite the States together under a Government\r\nendowed with powers adequate to the purposes of its institution,\r\nrelating, directly or indirectly, to foreign concerns, to the discharge\r\nof which a National Government thus formed alone could be competent.\r\n\r\nThis view of the exclusive jurisdiction of the several States over the\r\nterritory within their respective limits, except in cases otherwise\r\nspecially provided for, is supported by the obvious intent of the\r\nseveral powers granted to Congress, to which a more particular attention\r\nis now due. Of these the right to declare war is perhaps the most\r\nimportant, as well by the consequences attending war as by the other\r\npowers granted in aid of it. The right to lay taxes, duties, imposts,\r\nand excises, though necessary for the support of the civil government,\r\nis equally necessary to sustain the charges of war; the right to raise\r\nand support armies and a navy and to call forth and govern the militia\r\nwhen in the service of the United States are altogether of the latter\r\nkind. They are granted in aid of the power to make war and intended to\r\ngive effect to it. These several powers are of great force and extent,\r\nand operate more directly within the limits and upon the resources of\r\nthe States than any of the other powers. But still they are means only\r\nfor given ends. War is declared and must be maintained, an army and a\r\nnavy must be raised, fortifications must be erected for the common\r\ndefense, debts must be paid, For these purposes duties, imposts, and\r\nexcises are levied, taxes are laid, the lands, merchandise, and other\r\nproperty of the citizens are liable for them; if the money is not paid,\r\nseizures are made and the lands are sold. The transaction is terminated;\r\nthe lands pass into other hands, who hold them, as the former\r\nproprietors did, under the laws of the individual States. They were\r\nmeans only to certain ends; the United States have nothing further to\r\ndo with them. The same view is applicable to the power of the General\r\nGovernment over persons. The militia is called into the service of the\r\nUnited States; the service is performed; the corps returns to the State\r\nto which it belongs; it is the militia of such State, and not of the\r\nUnited States. Soldiers are required for the Army, who may be obtained\r\nby voluntary enlistment or by some other process founded in the\r\nprinciples of equality. In either case the citizen after the tour of\r\nduty is performed is restored to his former station in society, with his\r\nequal share in the common sovereignty of the nation. In all these cases,\r\nwhich are the strongest which can be given, we see that the right of\r\nthe General Government is nothing more than what it is called in the\r\nConstitution, a power to perform certain acts, and that the subject on\r\nwhich it operates is a means only to that end; that it was both before\r\nand after that act under the protection and subject to the laws of the\r\nindividual State within which it was.\r\n\r\nTo the other powers of the General Government the same remarks are\r\napplicable and with greater force. The right to regulate commerce with\r\nforeign powers was necessary as well to enable Congress to lay and\r\ncollect duties and imposts as to support the rights of the nation in\r\nthe intercourse with foreign powers. It is executed at the ports of\r\nthe several States and operates almost altogether externally. The right\r\nto borrow and coin money and to fix its value and that of foreign\r\ncoin are important to the establishment of a National Government, and\r\nparticularly necessary in support of the right to declare war, as,\r\nindeed, may be considered the right to punish piracy and felonies on\r\nthe high seas and offenses against the laws of nations. The right to\r\nestablish an uniform rule of naturalization and uniform laws respecting\r\nbankruptcies seems to be essentially connected with the right to\r\nregulate commerce. The first branch of it relates to foreigners entering\r\nthe country; the second to merchants who have failed. The right to\r\npromote the progress of useful arts and sciences may be executed without\r\ntouching any of the individual States. It is accomplished by granting\r\npatents to inventors and preserving models, which may be done\r\nexclusively within the Federal district. The right to constitute courts\r\ninferior to the Supreme Court was a necessary consequence of the\r\njudiciary existing as a separate branch of the General Government.\r\nWithout such inferior court in every State it would be difficult and\r\nmight even be impossible to carry into effect the laws of the General\r\nGovernment. The right to establish post-offices and post-roads is\r\nessentially of the same character. For political, commercial, and social\r\npurposes it was important that it should be vested in the General\r\nGovernment. As a mere matter of regulation, and nothing more, I presume,\r\nwas intended by it, it is a power easily executed and involving little\r\nauthority within the States individually. The right to exercise\r\nexclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over the Federal district\r\nand over forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful\r\nbuildings with the consent of the State within which the same may be is\r\na power of a peculiar character, and is sufficient in itself to confirm\r\nwhat has been said of all the other powers of the General Government.\r\nOf this particular grant further notice will hereafter be taken.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude my remarks on this part of the subject by observing\r\nthat the view which has been presented of the powers and character of\r\nthe two Governments is supported by the marked difference which is\r\nobservable in the manner of their endowment. The State governments\r\nare divided into three branches--a legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary--and the appropriate duties of each assigned to it without\r\nany limitation of power except such as is-necessary to guard against\r\nabuse, in the form of bills of right. But in instituting the National\r\nGovernment an entirely different principle was adopted and pursued. The\r\nGovernment itself is organized, like the State governments, into three\r\nbranches, but its powers are enumerated and defined in the most precise\r\nform. The subject has already been too fully explained to require\r\nillustration by a general view of the whole Constitution, every part\r\nof which affords proof of what is here advanced. It will be sufficient\r\nto advert to the eighth section of the first article, being that more\r\nparticularly which defines the powers and fixes the character of the\r\nGovernment of the United States. By this section it is declared that\r\nCongress shall have power, first, to lay and collect taxes, duties,\r\nimposts, and excises, etc.\r\n\r\nHaving shown the origin of the State governments and their endowments\r\nwhen first formed; having also shown the origin of the National\r\nGovernment and the powers vested in it, and having shown, lastly, the\r\npowers which are admitted to have remained to the State governments\r\nafter those which were taken from them by the National Government,\r\nI will now proceed to examine whether the power to adopt and execute\r\na system of internal improvement by roads and canals has been vested\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nBefore we can determine whether this power has been granted to the\r\nGeneral Government it will be necessary to ascertain distinctly the\r\nnature and extent of the power requisite to make such improvements.\r\nWhen that is done we shall be able to decide whether such power is\r\nvested in the National Government.\r\n\r\nIf the power existed it would, it is presumed, be executed by a board of\r\nskillful engineers, on a view of the whole Union, on a plan which would\r\nsecure complete effect to all the great purposes of our Constitution.\r\nIt is not my intention, however, to take up the subject here on this\r\nscale. I shall state a case for the purpose of illustration only. Let\r\nit be supposed that Congress intended to run a road from the city of\r\nWashington to Baltimore and to connect the Chesapeake Bay with the\r\nDelaware and the Delaware with the Raritan by a canal, what must be\r\ndone to carry the project into effect? I make here no question of the\r\nexisting power. I speak only of the power necessary for the purpose.\r\nCommissioners would be appointed to trace a route in the most direct\r\nline, paying due regard to heights, water courses, and other obstacles,\r\nand to acquire the right to the ground over which the road and canal\r\nwould pass, with sufficient breadth for each. This must be done by\r\nvoluntary grants, or by purchases from individuals, or, in case they\r\nwould not sell or should ask an exorbitant price, by condemning the\r\nproperty and fixing its value by a jury of the vicinage. The next object\r\nto be attended to after the road and canal are laid out and made is to\r\nkeep them in repair. We know that there are people in every community\r\ncapable of committing voluntary injuries, of pulling down walls that are\r\nmade to sustain the road, of breaking the bridges over water courses,\r\nand breaking the road itself. Some living near it might be disappointed\r\nthat it did not pass through their lands and commit these acts of\r\nviolence and waste from revenge or in the hope of giving it that\r\ndirection, though for a short time. Injuries of this kind have been\r\ncommitted and are still complained of on the road from Cumberland to the\r\nOhio. To accomplish this object Congress should have a right to pass\r\nlaws to punish offenders wherever they may be found. Jurisdiction over\r\nthe road would not be sufficient, though it were exclusive. It would\r\nseldom happen that the parties would be detected in the act. They would\r\ngenerally commit it in the night and fly far off before the sun\r\nappeared. The power to punish these culprits must therefore reach them\r\nwherever they go. They must also be amenable to competent tribunals,\r\nFederal or State. The power must likewise extend to another object not\r\nless essential or important than those already mentioned. Experience\r\nhas shown that the establishment of turnpikes, with gates and tolls and\r\npersons to collect the tolls, is the best expedient that can be adopted\r\nto defray the expense of these improvements and the repairs which they\r\nnecessarily require. Congress must therefore have power to make such\r\nan establishment and to support it by such regulations, with fines and\r\npenalties in the case of injuries, as may be competent to the purpose.\r\nThe right must extend to all those objects, or it will be utterly\r\nincompetent. It is possessed and exercised by the States individually,\r\nand it must be possessed by the United States or the pretension must be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nLet it be further supposed that Congress, believing that they do\r\npossess the power, have passed an act for those purposes, under which\r\ncommissioners have been appointed, who have begun the work. They are met\r\nat the first farm on which they enter by the owner, who forbids them\r\nto trespass on his land. They offer to buy it at a fair price or at\r\ntwice or thrice its value. He persists in his refusal. Can they, on the\r\nprinciple recognized and acted on by all the State governments that in\r\ncases of this kind the obstinacy and perverseness of an individual must\r\nyield to the public welfare, summon a jury of upright and discreet men\r\nto condemn the land, value it, and compel the owner to receive the\r\namount and to deliver it up to them? I believe that very few would\r\nconcur in the opinion that such a power exists.\r\n\r\nThe next object is to preserve these improvements from injury. The locks\r\nof the canal are broken, the walls which sustained the road are pulled\r\ndown, the bridges are broken, the road itself is plowed up, toll is\r\nrefused to be paid, the gates of the canal or turnpike are forced.\r\nThe offenders are pursued, caught, and brought to trial. Can they\r\nbe punished? The question of right must be decided on principle. The\r\nculprits will avail themselves of every barrier that may serve to screen\r\nthem from punishment. They will plead that the law under which they\r\nstand arraigned is unconstitutional, and that question must be decided\r\nby the court, whether Federal or State, on a fair investigation of the\r\npowers vested in the General Government by the Constitution. If the\r\njudges find that these powers have not been granted to Congress, the\r\nprisoners must be acquitted, and by their acquittal all claim to the\r\nright to establish such a system is at an end.\r\n\r\nI have supposed an opposition to be made to the right in Congress by the\r\nowner of the land and other individuals charged with breaches of laws\r\nmade to protect the works from injury, because it is the mildest form in\r\nwhich it can present itself. It is not, however, the only one. A State,\r\nalso, may contest the right, and then the controversy assumes another\r\ncharacter. Government might contend against government, for to a certain\r\nextent both the Governments are sovereign and independent of each other,\r\nand in that form it is possible, though not probable, that opposition\r\nmight be made. To each limitations are prescribed, and should a contest\r\nrise between them respecting their rights and the people sustain it with\r\nanything like an equal division of numbers the worst consequences might\r\nensue.\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that the opposition suggested by the owner of the\r\nland or by the States individually may be avoided by a satisfactory\r\narrangement with the parties. But a suppression of opposition in that\r\nway is no proof of a right in Congress, nor could it, if confined to\r\nthat limit, remove all the impediments to the exercise of the power.\r\nIt is not sufficient that Congress may by the command and application\r\nof the public revenue purchase the soil, and thus silence that class of\r\nindividuals, or by the accommodation afforded to individual States put\r\ndown opposition on their part. Congress must be able rightfully to\r\ncontrol all opposition or they can not carry the system into effect.\r\nCases would inevitably occur to put the right to the test. The work must\r\nbe preserved from injury, tolls must be collected, offenders must be\r\npunished. With these culprits no bargain can be made. When brought\r\nto trial they must deny the validity of the law, and that plea being\r\nsustained all claim to the right ceases.\r\n\r\nIf the United States possess this power, it must be either because it\r\nhas been specifically granted or that it is incidental and necessary\r\nto carry into effect some specific grant. The advocates for the power\r\nderive it from the following sources: First, the right to establish\r\npost-offices and post-roads; second, to declare war; third, to regulate\r\ncommerce among the several States; fourth, from the power to pay the\r\ndebts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the\r\nUnited States; fifth, from the power to make all laws necessary and\r\nproper for carrying into execution all the powers vested by the\r\nConstitution in the Government of the United States or in any department\r\nor officer thereof; sixth and lastly, from the power to dispose of and\r\nmake all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory and\r\nother property of the United States. It is to be observed that there\r\nis but little accord among the advocates for this power as to the\r\nparticular source from whence it is derived. They all agree, however,\r\nin ascribing it to some one or more of those above mentioned. I will\r\nexamine the ground of the claim in each instance.\r\n\r\nThe first of these grants is in the following words: \"Congress shall\r\nhave power to establish post-offices and post-roads.\" What is the just\r\nimport of these words and the extent of the grant? The word \"establish\"\r\nis the ruling term; \"post-offices and post-roads\" are the subjects on\r\nwhich it acts. The question therefore is, What power is granted by that\r\nword? The sense in which words are commonly used is that in which they\r\nare to be understood in all transactions between public bodies and\r\nindividuals. The intention of the parties is to prevail, and there is\r\nno better way of ascertaining it than by giving to the terms used their\r\nordinary import. If we were to ask any number of our most enlightened\r\ncitizens, who had no connection with public affairs and whose minds were\r\nunprejudiced, what was the import of the word \"establish\" and the extent\r\nof the grant which it controls, we do not think there would be any\r\ndifference of opinion among them. We are satisfied that all of them\r\nwould answer that a power was thereby given to Congress to fix on the\r\ntowns, court-houses, and other places throughout our Union at which\r\nthere should be post-offices, the routes by which the mails should be\r\ncarried from one post-office to another, so as to diffuse intelligence\r\nas extensively and to make the institution as useful as possible, to\r\nfix the postage to be paid on every letter and packet thus carried, to\r\nsupport the establishment, and to protect the post-office and mails from\r\nrobbery by punishing those who should commit the offense. The idea of a\r\nright to lay off the roads of the United States on a general scale of\r\nimprovement, to take the soil from the proprietor by force, to establish\r\nturnpikes and tolls, and to punish offenders in the manner stated above\r\nwould never occur to any such person. The use of the existing road by\r\nthe stage, mail carrier, or postboy in passing over it as others do is\r\nall that would be thought of, the jurisdiction and soil remaining to the\r\nState, with a right in the State or those authorized by its legislature\r\nto change the road at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe intention of the parties is supported by other proof, which ought\r\nto place it beyond all doubt. In the former act of Government, the\r\nConfederation, we find a grant for the same purpose expressed in the\r\nfollowing words: \"The United States in Congress assembled shall have\r\nthe sole and exclusive right and power of establishing and regulating\r\npost-offices from one State to another throughout all the United States,\r\nand exacting such postage on the papers passing through the same as\r\nmay be requisite to defray the expenses of the said office.\" The term\r\n\"establish\" was likewise the ruling one in that instrument, and was\r\nevidently intended and understood to give a power simply and solely to\r\nfix where there should be post-offices. By transferring this term from\r\nthe Confederation into the Constitution it was doubtless intended that\r\nit should be understood in the same sense in the latter that it was\r\nin the former instrument, and to be applied alike to post-offices and\r\npost-roads. In whatever sense it is applied to post-offices it must\r\nbe applied in the same sense to post-roads. But it may be asked, If\r\nsuch was the intention, why were not all the other terms of the grant\r\ntransferred with it? The reason is obvious. The Confederation being a\r\nbond of union between independent States, it was necessary in granting\r\nthe powers which were to be exercised over them to be very explicit\r\nand minute in defining the powers granted. But the Constitution to the\r\nextent of its powers having incorporated the States into one Government\r\nlike the government of the States individually, fewer words in defining\r\nthe powers granted by it were not only adequate, but perhaps better\r\nadapted to the purpose. We find that brevity is a characteristic of the\r\ninstrument. Had it been intended to convey a more enlarged power in the\r\nConstitution than had been granted in the Confederation, surely the same\r\ncontrolling term would not have been used, or other words would have\r\nbeen added, to show such intention and to mark the extent to which the\r\npower should be carried. It is a liberal construction of the powers\r\ngranted in the Constitution by this term to include in it all the powers\r\nthat were granted in the Confederation by terms which specifically\r\ndefined and, as was supposed, extended their limits. It would be absurd\r\nto say that by omitting from the Constitution any portion of the\r\nphraseology which was deemed important in the Confederation the import\r\nof that term was enlarged, and with it the powers of the Constitution,\r\nin a proportional degree, beyond what they were in the Confederation.\r\nThe right to exact postage and to protect the post-offices and mails\r\nfrom robbery by punishing the offenders may fairly be considered as\r\nincidents to the grant, since without it the object of the grant might\r\nbe defeated. Whatever is absolutely necessary to the accomplishment of\r\nthe object of the grant, though not specified, may fairly be considered\r\nas included in it. Beyond this the doctrine of incidental power can not\r\nbe carried.\r\n\r\nIf we go back to the origin of our settlements and institutions and\r\ntrace their progress down to the Revolution, we shall see that it was in\r\nthis sense, and in none other, that the power was exercised by all our\r\ncolonial governments. Post-offices were made for the country, and not\r\nthe country for them. They are the offspring of improvement; they never\r\ngo before it. Settlements are first made, after which the progress is\r\nuniform and simple, extending to objects in regular order most necessary\r\nto the comfort of man--schools, places of public worship, court-houses,\r\nand markets; post-offices follow. Roads may, indeed, be said to be\r\ncoeval with settlements; they lead to all the places mentioned, and\r\nto every other which the various and complicated interests of society\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that not one example can be given, from the first\r\nsettlement of our country to the adoption of this Constitution,\r\nof a post-office being established without a view to existing roads or\r\nof a single road having been made by pavement, turnpike, etc., for the\r\nsole purpose of accommodating a post-office. Such, too, is the uniform\r\nprogress of all societies. In granting, then, this power to the United\r\nStates it was undoubtedly intended by the framers and ratifiers of the\r\nConstitution to convey it in the sense and extent only in which it had\r\nbeen understood and exercised by the previous authorities of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the object of the grant and the\r\nmanner of its execution. The object is the transportation of the mail\r\nthroughout the United States, which may be done on horseback, and was\r\nso done until lately, since the establishment of stages. Between the\r\ngreat towns and in other places where the population is dense stages are\r\npreferred because they afford an additional opportunity to make a profit\r\nfrom passengers; but where the population is sparse and on crossroads it\r\nis generally carried on horseback. Unconnected with passengers and other\r\nobjects, it can not be doubted that the mail itself may be carried in\r\nevery part of our Union with nearly as much economy and greater dispatch\r\non horseback than in a stage, and in many parts with much greater. In\r\nevery part of the Union in which stages can be preferred the roads are\r\nsufficiently good provided those which serve for every other purpose\r\nwill accommodate them. In every other part where horses alone are used\r\nif other people pass them on horseback surely the mail carrier can. For\r\nan object so simple and so easy in its execution it would doubtless\r\nexcite surprise if it should be thought proper to appoint commissioners\r\nto lay off the country on a great scheme of improvement, with the\r\npower to shorten distances, reduce heights, level mountains, and pave\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\nIf the United States possessed the power contended for under this grant,\r\nmight they not in adopting the roads of the individual States for the\r\ncarriage of the mail, as has been done, assume jurisdiction over them\r\nand preclude a right to interfere with or alter them? Might they not\r\nestablish turnpikes and exercise all the other acts of sovereignty\r\nabove stated over such roads necessary to protect them from injury and\r\ndefray the expense of repairing them? Surely if the right exists these\r\nconsequences necessarily followed as soon as the road was established.\r\nThe absurdity of such a pretension must be apparent to all who examine\r\nit. In this way a large portion of the territory of every State might be\r\ntaken from it, for there is scarcely a road in any State which will not\r\nbe used for the transportation of the mail. A new field for legislation\r\nand internal government would thus be opened.\r\n\r\nFrom this view of the subject I think we may fairly conclude that the\r\nright to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement, or any part\r\nof it, has not been granted to Congress under the power to establish\r\npost-offices and post-roads; that the common roads of the country only\r\nwere contemplated by that grant and are fully competent to all its\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe next object of inquiry is whether the right to declare war\r\nincludes the right to adopt and execute this system of improvement.\r\nThe objections to it are, I presume, not less conclusive than those\r\nwhich are applicable to the grant which we have just examined.\r\n\r\nUnder the last-mentioned grant a claim has been set up to as much of\r\nthat system as relates to roads. Under this it extends alike to roads\r\nand canals.\r\n\r\nWe must examine this grant by the same rules of construction that\r\nwere applied to the preceding one. The object was to take this power\r\nfrom the individual States and to vest it in the General Government.\r\nThis has been done in clear and explicit terms, first by granting the\r\npower to Congress, and secondly by prohibiting the exercise of it by\r\nthe States. \"Congress shall have a right to declare war.\" This is the\r\nlanguage of the grant. If the right to adopt and execute this system\r\nof improvement is included in it, it must be by way of incident only,\r\nsince there is nothing in the grant itself which bears any relation to\r\nroads and canals. The following considerations, it is presumed, prove\r\nincontestably that this power has not been granted in that or any other\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe United States are exposed to invasion through the whole extent of\r\ntheir Atlantic coast by any European power with whom we might be engaged\r\nin war--on the northern and northwestern frontier on the side of Canada\r\nby Great Britain, and on the southern by Spain or any power in alliance\r\nwith her. If internal improvements are to be carried to the full extent\r\nto which they may be useful for military purposes, the power as it\r\nexists must apply to all the roads of the Union, there being no\r\nlimitation to it. Wherever such improvements may facilitate the march\r\nof troops, the transportation of cannon, or otherwise aid the operations\r\nor mitigate the calamities of war along the coast or in any part of the\r\ninterior they would be useful for military purposes, and might therefore\r\nbe made. The power following as an incident to another power can be\r\nmeasured as to its extent by reference only to the obvious extent of the\r\npower to which it is incidental. So great a scope was, it is believed,\r\nnever given to incidental power.\r\n\r\nIf it had been intended that the right to declare war should include\r\nall the powers necessary to maintain war, it would follow that nothing\r\nwould have been done to impair the right or to restrain Congress from\r\nthe exercise of any power which the exigencies of war might require.\r\nThe nature and extent of this exigency would mark the extent of the\r\npower granted, which should always be construed liberally, so as to be\r\nadequate to the end. A right to raise money by taxes, duties, excises,\r\nand by loan, to raise and support armies and a navy, to provide for\r\ncalling forth, arming, disciplining, and governing the militia when\r\nin the service of the United States, establishing fortifications and\r\ngoverning the troops stationed in them independently of the State\r\nauthorities, and to perform many other acts is indispensable to the\r\nmaintenance of war--no war with any great power can be prosecuted with\r\nsuccess without the command of the resources of the Union in all these\r\nrespects. These powers, then, would of necessity and by common consent\r\nhave fallen within the right to declare war had it been intended to\r\nconvey by way of incident to that right the necessary powers to maintain\r\nwar. But these powers have all been granted specifically with many\r\nothers, in great detail, which experience had shown were necessary for\r\nthe purposes of war. By specifically granting, then, these powers it\r\nis manifest that every power was thus granted which it was intended\r\nto grant for military purposes, and that it was also intended that no\r\nimportant power should be included in this grant by way of incident,\r\nhowever useful it might be for some of the purposes of the grant.\r\n\r\nBy the sixteenth of the enumerated powers, Article I, section 8,\r\nCongress are authorized to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases\r\nwhatever over such district as may by cession of particular States and\r\nthe acceptance of Congress, not exceeding 10 miles square, become the\r\nseat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like\r\nauthority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature\r\nof the State in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts,\r\nmagazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other useful buildings. If any doubt\r\nexisted on a view of other parts of the Constitution respecting the\r\ndecision which ought to be formed on the question under consideration,\r\nI should suppose that this clause would completely remove it. It has been\r\nshown after the most liberal construction of all the enumerated powers\r\nof the General Government that the territory within the limits of the\r\nrespective States belonged to them; that the United States had no right\r\nunder the powers granted to them, with the exception specified in this\r\ngrant, to any the smallest portion of territory within a State, all\r\nthose powers operating on a different principle and having their full\r\neffect without impairing in the slightest degree this right in the\r\nStates; that those powers were in every instance means to ends, which\r\nbeing accomplished left the subject--that is, the property, in which\r\nlight only land could be regarded--where it was before, under the\r\njurisdiction and subject to the laws of the State governments.\r\n\r\nThe second number of the clause, which is applicable to military\r\nand naval purposes alone, claims particular attention here. It fully\r\nconfirms the view taken of the other enumerated powers, for had it been\r\nintended to include in the right to declare war, by way of incident,\r\nany right of jurisdiction or legislation over territory within a State,\r\nit would have been done as to fortifications, magazines, arsenals,\r\ndockyards, and other needful buildings. By specifically granting the\r\nright as to such small portions of territory as might be necessary for\r\nthese purposes and on certain conditions, minutely and well defined,\r\nit is manifest that it was not intended to grant it as to any other\r\nportion on any condition for any purpose or in any manner whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that although the authority to exercise exclusive\r\nlegislation in certain cases within the States with their consent may\r\nbe considered as a prohibition to Congress to exercise like exclusive\r\nlegislation in any other case, although their consent should be granted,\r\nit does not prohibit the exercise of such jurisdiction or power within\r\na State as would be competent to all the purposes of internal\r\nimprovement. I can conceive no ground on which the idea of such a power\r\nover any part of the territory of a State can be inferred from the power\r\nto declare war. There never can be an occasion for jurisdiction for\r\nmilitary purposes except in fortifications, dockyards, and the like\r\nplaces. If the soldiers are in the field or are quartered in garrisons\r\nwithout the fortifications, the civil authority must prevail where they\r\nare. The government of the troops by martial law is not affected by it.\r\nIn war, when the forces are increased and the movement is on a greater\r\nscale, consequences follow which are inseparable from the exigencies\r\nof the state. More freedom of action and a wider range of power in the\r\nmilitary commanders, to be exercised on their own responsibility, may\r\nbe necessary to the public safety; but even here the civil authority\r\nof the State never ceases to operate. It is also exclusive for all\r\ncivil purposes.\r\n\r\nWhether any power short of that stated would be adequate to the purposes\r\nof internal improvement is denied. In the case of territory one\r\ngovernment must prevail for all the purposes intended by the grant.\r\nThe jurisdiction of the United States might be modified in such manner\r\nas to admit that of the State in all cases and for all purposes not\r\nnecessary to the execution of the proposed power; but the right of the\r\nGeneral Government must be complete for all the purposes above stated.\r\nIt must extend to the seizure and condemnation of the property, if\r\nnecessary; to the punishment of offenders for injuries to the roads and\r\ncanals; to the establishment and enforcement of tolls, etc. It must be\r\na complete right to the extent above stated or it will be of no avail.\r\nThat right does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which operate in favor of the right of exclusive legislation\r\nin forts, dockyards, etc., do not apply to any other places. The safety\r\nof such works and of the cities which they are intended to defend, and\r\neven of whole communities, may sometimes depend on it. If spies are\r\nadmitted within them in time of war, they might communicate intelligence\r\nto the enemy which might be fatal. All nations surround such works\r\nwith high walls and keep their gates shut. Even here, however, three\r\nimportant conditions are indispensable to such exclusive legislation:\r\nFirst, the ground must be requisite for and be applied to those\r\npurposes; second, it must be purchased; third, it must be purchased by\r\nthe consent of the State in which it may be. When we find that so much\r\ncare has been taken to protect the sovereignty of the States over the\r\nterritory within their respective limits, admitting that of the United\r\nStates over such small portions and for such special and important\r\npurposes only, the conclusion is irresistible not only that the power\r\nnecessary for internal improvements has not been granted, but that it\r\nhas been clearly prohibited.\r\n\r\nI come next to the right to regulate commerce, the third source from\r\nwhence the right to make internal improvements is claimed. It is\r\nexpressed in the following words: \"Congress shall have power to regulate\r\ncommerce with foreign nations and among the several States and with the\r\nIndian tribes.\" The reasoning applicable to the preceding claims is\r\nequally so to this. The mischief complained of was that this power could\r\nnot be exercised with advantage by the individual States, and the object\r\nwas to transfer it to the United States. The sense in which the power\r\nwas understood and exercised by the States was doubtless that in which\r\nit was transferred to the United States. The policy was the same\r\nas to three branches of this grant, and it is scarcely possible to\r\nseparate the two first from each other in any view which may be taken\r\nof the subject. The last, relating to the Indian tribes, is of a\r\nnature distinct from the others for reasons too well known to require\r\nexplanation. Commerce between independent powers or communities is\r\nuniversally regulated by duties and imposts. It was so regulated by the\r\nStates before the adoption of this Constitution equally in respect to\r\neach other and to foreign powers. The goods and vessels employed in the\r\ntrade are the only subjects of regulation. It can act on none other.\r\nA power, then, to impose such duties and imposts in regard to foreign\r\nnations and to prevent any on the trade between the States was the only\r\npower granted.\r\n\r\nIf we recur to the causes which produced the adoption of this\r\nConstitution, we shall find that injuries resulting from the regulation\r\nof trade by the States respectively and the advantages anticipated from\r\nthe transfer of the power to Congress were among those which had the\r\nmost weight. Instead of acting as a nation in regard to foreign powers,\r\nthe States individually had commenced a system of restraint on each\r\nother whereby the interests of foreign powers were promoted at their\r\nexpense. If one State imposed high duties on the goods or vessels of\r\na foreign power to countervail the regulations of such power, the next\r\nadjoining States imposed lighter duties to invite those articles into\r\ntheir ports, that they might be transferred thence into the other\r\nStates, securing the duties to themselves. This contracted policy in\r\nsome of the States was soon counteracted by others. Restraints were\r\nimmediately laid on such commerce by the suffering States, and thus had\r\ngrown up a state of affairs disorderly and unnatural, the tendency of\r\nwhich was to destroy the Union itself and with it all hope of realizing\r\nthose blessings which we had anticipated from the glorious Revolution\r\nwhich had been so recently achieved. From this deplorable dilemma, or,\r\nrather, certain ruin, we were happily rescued by the adoption of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nAmong the first and most important effects of this great Revolution\r\nwas the complete abolition of this pernicious policy. The States were\r\nbrought together by the Constitution as to commerce into one community\r\nequally in regard to foreign nations and each other. The regulations\r\nthat were adopted regarded us in both respects as one people. The duties\r\nand imposts that were laid on the vessels and merchandise of foreign\r\nnations were all uniform throughout the United States, and in the\r\nintercourse between the States themselves no duties of any kind were\r\nimposed other than between different ports and counties within the\r\nsame State.\r\n\r\nThis view is supported by a series of measures, all of a marked\r\ncharacter, preceding the adoption of the Constitution. As early as\r\nthe year 1781 Congress recommended it to the States to vest in the\r\nUnited States a power to levy a duty of 5 per cent on all goods imported\r\nfrom foreign countries into the United States for the term of fifteen\r\nyears. In 1783 this recommendation, with alterations as to the kind of\r\nduties and an extension of this term to twenty-five years, was repeated\r\nand more earnestly urged. In 1784 it was recommended to the States\r\nto authorize Congress to prohibit, under certain modifications, the\r\nimportation of goods from foreign powers into the United States for\r\nfifteen years. In 1785 the consideration of the subject was resumed,\r\nand a proposition presented in a new form, with an address to the\r\nStates, explaining fully the principles on which a grant of the power\r\nto regulate trade was deemed indispensable. In 1786 a meeting took place\r\nat Annapolis of delegates from several of the States on this subject,\r\nand on their report a convention was formed at Philadelphia the ensuing\r\nyear from all the States, to whose deliberations we are indebted for\r\nthe present Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn none of these measures was the subject of internal improvement\r\nmentioned or even glanced at. Those of 1784, 1785, 1786, and 1787,\r\nleading step by step to the adoption of the Constitution, had in view\r\nonly the obtaining of a power to enable Congress to regulate trade with\r\nforeign powers. It is manifest that the regulation of trade with the\r\nseveral States was altogether a secondary object, suggested by and\r\nadopted in connection with the other. If the power necessary to this\r\nsystem of improvement is included under either branch of this grant,\r\nI should suppose that it was the first rather than the second. The\r\npretension to it, however, under that branch has never been set up.\r\nIn support of the claim under the second no reason has been assigned\r\nwhich appears to have the least weight.\r\n\r\nThe fourth claim is founded on the right of Congress to \"pay the debts\r\nand provide for the common defense and general welfare\" of the United\r\nStates. This claim has less reason on its side than either of those\r\nwhich we have already examined. The power of which this forms a part\r\nis expressed in the following words: \"Congress shall have power to lay\r\nand collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; to pay the debts and\r\nprovide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States;\r\nbut all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the\r\nUnited States.\" That the second part of this grant gives a right to\r\nappropriate the public money, and nothing more, is evident from the\r\nfollowing considerations: First. If the right of appropriation is not\r\ngiven by this clause, it is not given at all, there being no other grant\r\nin the Constitution which gives it directly or which has any bearing\r\non the subject, even by implication, except the two following: First,\r\nthe prohibition, which is contained in the eleventh of the enumerated\r\npowers, not to appropriate money for the support of armies for a longer\r\nterm than two years; and, second, the declaration of the sixth member\r\nor clause of the ninth section of the first article that no money shall\r\nbe drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by\r\nlaw. Second. This part of the grant has none of the characteristics of\r\na distinct and original power. It is manifestly incidental to the great\r\nobjects of the first part of the grant, which authorizes Congress to lay\r\nand collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, a power of vast extent,\r\nnot granted by the Confederation, the grant of which formed one of the\r\nprincipal inducements to the adoption of this Constitution. If both\r\nparts of the grant are taken together (as they must be, for the one\r\nfollows immediately after the other in the same sentence), it seems\r\nto be impossible to give to the latter any other construction than\r\nthat contended for. Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes,\r\nduties, imposts, and excises. For what purpose? To pay the debts and\r\nprovide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,\r\nan arrangement and phraseology which clearly show that the latter part\r\nof the clause was intended to enumerate the purposes to which the money\r\nthus raised might be appropriated. Third. If this is not the real object\r\nand fair construction of the second part of this grant, it follows\r\neither that it has no import or operation whatever or one of much\r\ngreater extent than the first part. This presumption is evidently\r\ngroundless in both instances. In the first because no part of the\r\nConstitution can be considered useless; no sentence or clause in it\r\nwithout a meaning. In the second because such a construction as made the\r\nsecond part of the clause an original grant, embracing the same object\r\nwith the first, but with much greater power than it, would be in the\r\nhighest degree absurd. The order generally observed in grants, an order\r\nfounded in common sense, since it promotes a clear understanding of\r\ntheir import, is to grant the power intended to be conveyed in the\r\nmost full and explicit manner, and then to explain or qualify it, if\r\nexplanation or qualification should be necessary. This order has, it\r\nis believed, been invariably observed in all the grants contained in\r\nthe Constitution. In the second because if the clause in question is\r\nnot construed merely as an authority to appropriate the public money,\r\nit must be obvious that it conveys a power of indefinite and unlimited\r\nextent; that there would have been no use for the special powers to\r\nraise and support armies and a navy, to regulate commerce, to call forth\r\nthe militia, or even to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and\r\nexcises. An unqualified power to pay the debts and provide for the\r\ncommon defense and general welfare, as the second part of this clause\r\nwould be if considered as a distinct and separate grant, would extend to\r\nevery object in which the public could be interested. A power to provide\r\nfor the common defense would give to Congress the command of the whole\r\nforce and of all the resources of the Union; but a right to provide for\r\nthe general welfare would go much further. It would, in effect, break\r\ndown all the barriers between the States and the General Government and\r\nconsolidate the whole under the latter.\r\n\r\nThe powers specifically granted to Congress are what are called the\r\nenumerated powers, and are numbered in the order in which they stand,\r\namong which that contained in the first clause holds the first place\r\nin point of importance. If the power created by the latter part of the\r\nclause is considered an original grant, unconnected with and independent\r\nof the first, as in that case it must be, then the first part is\r\nentirely done away, as are all the other grants in the Constitution,\r\nbeing completely absorbed in the transcendent power granted in the\r\nlatter part; but if the clause be construed in the sense contended for,\r\nthen every part has an important meaning and effect; not a line, a word,\r\nin it is superfluous. A power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts,\r\nand excises subjects to the call of Congress every branch of the public\r\nrevenue, internal and external, and the addition to pay the debts and\r\nprovide for the common defense and general welfare gives the right of\r\napplying the money raised--that is, of appropriating it to the purposes\r\nspecified according to a proper construction of the terms. Hence it\r\nfollows that it is the first part of the clause only which gives a power\r\nwhich affects in any manner the power remaining to the States, as the\r\npower to raise money from the people, whether it be by taxes, duties,\r\nimposts, or excises, though concurrent in the States as to taxes and\r\nexcises must necessarily do. But the use or application of the money\r\nafter it is raised is a power altogether of a different character.\r\nIt imposes no burden on the people, nor can it act on them in a sense\r\nto take power from the States or in any sense in which power can be\r\ncontroverted, or become a question between the two Governments. The\r\napplication of money raised under a lawful power is a right or grant\r\nwhich may be abused. It may be applied partially among the States, or\r\nto improper purposes in our foreign and domestic concerns; but still\r\nit is a power not felt in the sense of other power, since the only\r\ncomplaint which any State can make of such partiality and abuse is\r\nthat some other State or States have obtained greater benefit from the\r\napplication than by a just rule of apportionment they were entitled to.\r\nThe right of appropriation is therefore from its nature secondary and\r\nincidental to the right of raising money, and it was proper to place\r\nit in the same grant and same clause with that right. By rinding them,\r\nthen, in that order we see a new proof of the sense in which the grant\r\nwas made, corresponding with the view herein taken of it.\r\n\r\nThe last part of this grant, which provides that all duties, imposts,\r\nand excises shall be uniform throughout the United States, furnishes\r\nanother strong proof that it was not intended that the second part\r\nshould constitute a distinct grant in the sense above stated, or\r\nconvey any other right than that of appropriation. This provision\r\noperates exclusively on the power granted in the first part of the\r\nclause. It recites three branches of that power--duties, imposts, and\r\nexcises--those only on which it could operate, the rule by which the\r\nfourth--that is, taxes--should be laid being already provided for in\r\nanother part of the Constitution. The object of this provision is to\r\nsecure a just equality among the States in the exercise of that power\r\nby Congress. By placing it after both the grants--that is, after that\r\nto raise and that to appropriate the public money--and making it apply\r\nto the first only it shows that it was not intended that the power\r\ngranted in the second should be paramount to and destroy that granted in\r\nthe first. It shows also that no such formidable power as that suggested\r\nhad been granted in the second, or any power against the abuse of which\r\nit was thought necessary specially to provide. Surely if it was deemed\r\nproper to guard a specific power of limited extent and well-known\r\nimport against injustice and abuse, it would have been much more so\r\nto have guarded against the abuse of a power of such vast extent and so\r\nindefinite as would have been granted by the second part of the clause\r\nif considered as a distinct and original grant.\r\n\r\nWith this construction all the other enumerated grants, and, indeed,\r\nall the grants of power contained in the Constitution, have their full\r\noperation and effect. They all stand well together, fulfilling the great\r\npurposes intended by them. Under it we behold a great scheme, consistent\r\nin all its parts, a Government instituted for national purposes, vested\r\nwith adequate powers for those purposes, commencing with the most\r\nimportant of all, that of the revenue, and proceeding in regular order\r\nto the others with which it was deemed proper to endow it, all, too,\r\ndrawn with the utmost circumspection and care. How much more consistent\r\nis this construction with the great objects of the institution and with\r\nthe high character of the enlightened and patriotic citizens who framed\r\nit, as well as of those who ratified it, than one which subverts every\r\nsound principle and rule of construction and throws everything into\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt thus long on this part of the subject from an earnest\r\ndesire to fix in a clear and satisfactory manner the import of the\r\nsecond part of this grant, well knowing from the generality of the terms\r\nused their tendency to lead into error. I indulge a strong hope that\r\nthe view herein presented will not be without effect, but will tend to\r\nsatisfy the unprejudiced and impartial that nothing more was granted by\r\nthat part than a power to _appropriate_ the public money raised under\r\nthe other part. To what extent that power may be carried will be the\r\nnext object of inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt is contended on the one side that as the National Government is\r\na government of limited powers it has no right to expend money except\r\nin the performance of acts authorized by the other specific grants\r\naccording to a strict construction of their powers; that this grant\r\nin neither of its branches gives to Congress discretionary power of\r\nany kind, but is a mere instrument in its hands to carry into effect\r\nthe powers contained in the other grants. To this construction I was\r\ninclined in the more early stage of our Government; but on further\r\nreflection and observation my mind has undergone a change, for reasons\r\nwhich I will frankly unfold.\r\n\r\nThe grant consists, as heretofore observed, of a twofold power--the\r\nfirst to raise, the second to appropriate, the public money--and the\r\nterms used in both instances are general and unqualified. Bach branch\r\nwas obviously drawn with a view to the other, and the import of each\r\ntends to illustrate that of the other. The grant to raise money gives\r\na power over every subject from which revenue may be drawn, and is made\r\nin the same manner with the grants to declare war, to raise and support\r\narmies and a navy, to regulate commerce, to establish post-offices\r\nand post-roads, and with all the other specific grants to the General\r\nGovernment. In the discharge of the powers contained in any of these\r\ngrants there is no other check than that which is to be found in the\r\ngreat principles of our system, the responsibility of the representative\r\nto his constituents. If war, for example, is necessary, and Congress\r\ndeclare it for good cause, their constituents will support them in it.\r\nA like support will be given them for the faithful discharge of their\r\nduties under any and every other power vested in the United States.\r\nIt affords to the friends of our free governments the most heartfelt\r\nconsolation to know--and from the best evidence, our own experience--that\r\nin great emergencies the boldest measures, such as form the strongest\r\nappeals to the virtue and patriotism of the people, are sure to obtain\r\nthe most decided approbation. But should the representative act\r\ncorruptly and betray his trust, or otherwise prove that he was unworthy\r\nof the confidence of his constituents, he would be equally sure to lose\r\nit and to be removed and otherwise censured, according to his deserts.\r\nThe power to raise money by taxes, duties, imposts, and excises is alike\r\nunqualified, nor do I see any check on the exercise of it other than\r\nthat which applies to the other powers above recited, the responsibility\r\nof the representative to his constituents. Congress know the extent of\r\nthe public engagements and the sums necessary to meet them; they know\r\nhow much may be derived from each branch of revenue without pressing\r\nit too far; and, paying due regard to the interests of the people,\r\nthey likewise know which branch ought to be resorted to in the first\r\ninstance. From the commencement of the Government two branches of this\r\npower, duties and imposts, have been in constant operation, the revenue\r\nfrom which has supported the Government in its various branches and met\r\nits other ordinary engagements. In great emergencies the other two,\r\ntaxes and excises, have likewise been resorted to, and neither was the\r\nright or the policy ever called in question.\r\n\r\nIf we look to the second branch of this power, that which authorizes the\r\nappropriation of the money thus raised, we find that it is not less\r\ngeneral and unqualified than the power to raise it. More comprehensive\r\nterms than to \"pay the debts and provide for the common defense and\r\ngeneral welfare\" could not have been used. So intimately connected with\r\nand dependent on each other are these two branches of power that had\r\neither been limited the limitation would have had the like effect on\r\nthe other. Had the power to raise money been conditional or restricted\r\nto special purposes, the appropriation must have corresponded with it,\r\nfor none but the money raised could be appropriated, nor could it be\r\nappropriated to other purposes than those which were permitted. On the\r\nother hand, if the right of appropriation had been restricted to certain\r\npurposes, it would be useless and improper to raise more than would be\r\nadequate to those purposes. It may fairly be inferred these restraints\r\nor checks have been carefully and intentionally avoided. The power in\r\neach branch is alike broad and unqualified, and each is drawn with\r\npeculiar fitness to the other, the latter requiring terms of great\r\nextent and force to accommodate the former, which have been adopted,\r\nand both placed in the same clause and sentence.\r\n\r\nCan it be presumed that all these circumstances were so nicely adjusted\r\nby mere accident? Is it not more just to conclude that they were the\r\nresult of due deliberation and design? Had it been intended that\r\nCongress should be restricted in the appropriation of the public money\r\nto such expenditures as were authorized by a rigid construction of the\r\nother specific grants, how easy would it have been to have provided for\r\nit by a declaration to that effect. The omission of such declaration is\r\ntherefore an additional proof that it was not intended that the grant\r\nshould be so construed.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently impossible to have subjected this grant in either\r\nbranch to such restriction without exposing the Government to very\r\nserious embarrassment. How carry it into effect? If the grant had been\r\nmade in any degree dependent upon the States, the Government would have\r\nexperienced the fate of the Confederation. Like it, it would have\r\nwithered and soon perished. Had the Supreme Court been authorized, or\r\nshould any other tribunal distinct from the Government be authorized,\r\nto impose its veto, and to say that more money had been raised under\r\neither branch of this power--that is, by taxes, duties, imposts, or\r\nexcises--than was necessary, that such a tax or duty was useless, that\r\nthe appropriation to this or that purpose was unconstitutional, the\r\nmovement might have been suspended and the whole system disorganized.\r\nIt was impossible to have created a power within the Government or\r\nany other power distinct from Congress and the Executive which should\r\ncontrol the movement of the Government in this respect and not destroy\r\nit. Had it been declared by a clause in the Constitution that the\r\nexpenditures under this grant should be restricted to the construction\r\nwhich might be given of the other grants, such restraint, though the\r\nmost innocent, could not have failed to have had an injurious effect on\r\nthe vital principles of the Government and often on its most important\r\nmeasures. Those who might wish to defeat a measure proposed might\r\nconstrue the power relied on in support of it in a narrow and contracted\r\nmanner, and in that way fix a precedent inconsistent with the true\r\nimport of the grant. At other times those who favored a measure might\r\ngive to the power relied on a forced or strained construction, and,\r\nsucceeding in the object, fix a precedent in the opposite extreme.\r\nThus it is manifest that if the right of appropriation be confined\r\nto that limit, measures may oftentimes be carried or defeated by\r\nconsiderations and motives altogether independent of and unconnected\r\nwith their merits, and the several powers of Congress receive\r\nconstructions equally inconsistent with their true import. No such\r\ndeclaration, however, has been made, and from the fair import of the\r\ngrant, and, indeed, its positive terms, the inference that such was\r\nintended seems to be precluded.\r\n\r\nMany considerations of great weight operate in favor of this\r\nconstruction, while I do not perceive any serious objections to it.\r\nIf it be established, it follows that the words \"to provide for the\r\ncommon defense and general welfare\" have a definite, safe, and useful\r\nmeaning. The idea of their forming an original grant, with unlimited\r\npower, superseding every other grant, is abandoned. They will be\r\nconsidered simply as conveying a right of appropriation, a right\r\nindispensable to that of raising a revenue and necessary to expenditures\r\nunder every grant. By it, as already observed, no new power will be\r\ntaken from the States, the money to be appropriated being raised under\r\na power already granted to Congress. By it, too, the motive for giving\r\na forced or strained construction to any of the other specific grants\r\nwill in most instances be diminished and in many utterly destroyed.\r\nThe importance of this consideration can not be too highly estimated,\r\nsince, in addition to the examples already given, it ought particularly\r\nto be recollected that to whatever extent any specified power may be\r\ncarried the right of jurisdiction goes with it, pursuing it through\r\nall its incidents. The very important agency which this grant has in\r\ncarrying into effect every other grant is a wrong argument in favor of\r\nthe construction contended for. All the other grants are limited by\r\nthe nature of the offices which they have severally to perform, each\r\nconveying a power to do a certain thing, and that only, whereas this is\r\ncoextensive with the great scheme of the Government itself. It is the\r\nlever which raises and puts the whole machinery in motion and continues\r\nthe movement. Should either of the other grants fail in consequence of\r\nany condition or limitation attached to it or misconstruction of its\r\npowers, much injury might follow, but still it would be the failure of\r\none branch of power, of one item in the system only. All the others\r\nmight move on. But should the right to raise and appropriate the public\r\nmoney be improperly restricted, the whole system might be sensibly\r\naffected, if not disorganized. Each of the other grants is limited by\r\nthe nature of the grant itself; this, by the nature of the Government\r\nonly. Hence it became necessary that, like the power to declare war,\r\nthis power should be commensurate with the great scheme of the\r\nGovernment and with all its purposes.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the right to raise and appropriate the public money is not\r\nrestricted to the expenditures under the other specific grants according\r\nto a strict construction of their powers, respectively, is there no\r\nlimitation to it? Have Congress a right to raise and appropriate the\r\nmoney to any and to every purpose according to their will and pleasure?\r\nThey certainly have not. The Government of the United States is a\r\nlimited Government, instituted for great national purposes, and for\r\nthose only. Other interests are committed to the States, whose duty\r\nit is to provide for them. Each government should look to the great\r\nand essential purposes for which it was instituted and confine itself\r\nto those purposes. A State government will rarely if ever apply money to\r\nnational purposes without making it a charge to the nation. The people\r\nof the State would not permit it. Nor will Congress be apt to apply\r\nmoney in aid of the State administrations for purposes strictly local\r\nin which the nation at large has no interest, although the State should\r\ndesire it. The people of the other States would condemn it. They would\r\ndeclare that Congress had no right to tax them for such a purpose, and\r\ndismiss at the next election such of their representatives as had voted\r\nfor the measure, especially if it should be severely felt. I do not\r\nthink that in offices of this kind there is much danger of the two\r\nGovernments mistaking their interests or their duties. I rather expect\r\nthat they would soon have a clear and distinct understanding of them\r\nand move on in great harmony.\r\n\r\nGood roads and canals will promote many very important national\r\npurposes. They will facilitate the operations of war, the movements of\r\ntroops, the transportation of cannon, of provisions, and every warlike\r\nstore, much to our advantage and to the disadvantage of the enemy in\r\ntime of war. Good roads will facilitate the transportation of the mail,\r\nand thereby promote the purposes of commerce and political intelligence\r\namong the people. They will by being properly directed to these objects\r\nenhance the value of our vacant lands, a treasure of vast resource to\r\nthe nation. To the appropriation of the public money to improvements\r\nhaving these objects in view and carried to a certain extent I do not\r\nsee any well-founded constitutional objection.\r\n\r\nIn regard to our foreign concerns, provided they are managed with\r\nintegrity and ability, great liberality is allowable in the application\r\nof the public money. In the management of these concerns no State\r\ninterests can be affected, no State rights violated. The complete and\r\nexclusive control over them is vested in Congress. The power to form\r\ntreaties of alliance and commerce with foreign powers, to regulate by\r\nlaw our commerce with them, to determine on peace or war, to raise\r\narmies and a navy, to call forth the militia and direct their operations\r\nbelongs to the General Government. These great powers, embracing the\r\nwhole scope of our foreign relations, being granted, on what principle\r\ncan it be said that the minor are withheld? Are not the latter clearly\r\nand evidently comprised in the former? Nations are sometimes called upon\r\nto perform to each other acts of humanity and kindness, of which we see\r\nso many illustrious examples between individuals in private life. Great\r\ncalamities make appeals to the benevolence of mankind which ought not\r\nto be resisted. Good offices in such emergencies exalt the character\r\nof the party rendering them. By exciting grateful feelings they soften\r\nthe intercourse between nations and tend to prevent war. Surely if the\r\nUnited States have a right to make war they have a right to prevent it.\r\nHow was it possible to grant to Congress a power for such minor purposes\r\nother than in general terms, comprising it within the scope and policy\r\nof that which conveyed it for the greater?\r\n\r\nThe right of appropriation is nothing more than a right to apply the\r\npublic money to this or that purpose. It has no incidental power, nor\r\ndoes it draw after it any consequences of that kind. All that Congress\r\ncould do under it in the case of internal improvements would be to\r\nappropriate the money necessary to make them. For every act requiring\r\nlegislative sanction or support the State authority must be relied on.\r\nThe condemnation of the land, if the proprietors should refuse to sell\r\nit, the establishment of turnpikes and tolls, and the protection of the\r\nwork when finished must be done by the State. To these purposes the\r\npowers of the General Government are believed to be utterly incompetent.\r\n\r\nTo the objection that the United States have no power in any instance\r\nwhich is not complete to all the purposes to which it may be made\r\ninstrumental, and in consequence that they have no right to appropriate\r\nany portion of the public money to internal improvements because they\r\nhave not the right of sovereignty and jurisdiction over them when made,\r\na full answer has, it is presumed, been already given. It may, however,\r\nbe proper to add that if this objection was well founded it would not\r\nbe confined to the simple case of internal improvements, but would\r\napply to others of high importance. Congress have a right to regulate\r\ncommerce. To give effect to this power it becomes necessary to establish\r\ncustom-houses in every State along the coast and in many parts of\r\nthe interior. The vast amount of goods imported and the duties to be\r\nperformed to accommodate the merchants and secure the revenue make it\r\nnecessary that spacious buildings should be erected, especially in the\r\ngreat towns, for their reception. This, it is manifest, could best be\r\nperformed under the direction of the General Government. Have Congress\r\nthe right to seize the property of individuals if they should refuse\r\nto sell it, in quarters best adapted to the purpose, to have it valued,\r\nand to take it at the valuation? Have they a right to exercise\r\njurisdiction within those buildings? Neither of these claims has ever\r\nbeen set up, nor could it, as is presumed, be sustained. They have\r\ninvariably either rented houses where such as were suitable could be\r\nobtained, or, where they could not, purchased the ground of individuals,\r\nerected the buildings, and held them under the laws of the State. Under\r\nthe power to establish post-offices and post-roads houses are also\r\nrequisite for the reception of the mails and the transaction of the\r\nbusiness of the several offices. These have always been rented or\r\npurchased and held under the laws of the State in the same manner as\r\nif they had been taken by a citizen. The United States have a right to\r\nestablish tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court, and such have been\r\nestablished in every State of the Union. It is believed that the houses\r\nfor these inferior courts have invariably been rented. No right of\r\njurisdiction in them has ever been claimed, nor other right than that of\r\nprivilege, and that only while the court is in session. A still stronger\r\ncase may be urged. Should Congress be compelled by invasion or other\r\ncause to remove the Government to some town within one of the States,\r\nwould they have a right of jurisdiction over such town, or hold even the\r\nhouse in which they held their session under other authority than the\r\nlaws of such State? It is believed that they would not. If they have\r\na right to appropriate money for any of these purposes, to be laid out\r\nunder the protection of the laws of the State, surely they have an equal\r\nright to do it for the purposes of internal improvements.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that there is not a corporation in the Union which does\r\nnot exercise great discretion in the application of the money raised\r\nby it to the purposes of its institution. It would be strange if the\r\nGovernment of the United States, which was instituted for such important\r\npurposes and endowed with such extensive powers, should not be allowed\r\nat least equal discretion and authority. The evil to be particularly\r\navoided is the violation of State rights. Shunning that, it seems to be\r\nreasonable and proper that the powers of Congress should be so construed\r\nas that the General Government in its intercourse with other nations and\r\nin our internal concerns should be able to adopt all such measures lying\r\nwithin the fair scope and intended to facilitate the direct objects of\r\nits powers as the public welfare may require and a sound and provident\r\npolicy dictate.\r\n\r\nThe measures of Congress have been in strict accord with the view taken\r\nof the right of appropriation both as to its extent and limitation, as\r\nwill be shown by a reference to the laws, commencing at a very early\r\nperiod. Many roads have been opened, of which the following are the\r\nprincipal: The first from Cumberland, at the head waters of the Potomac,\r\nin the State of Maryland, through Pennsylvania and Virginia, to the\r\nState of Ohio (March 29, 1806; see vol. 4, p. 13, of the late edition\r\nof the laws). The second from the frontiers of Georgia, on the route\r\nfrom Athens to New Orleans, to its intersection with the thirty-first\r\ndegree of north latitude (April 31, 1806, p. 58). The third from the\r\nMississippi at a point and by a route described to the Ohio (same act).\r\nThe fourth from Nashville, in Tennessee, to Natchez (same act). The\r\nfifth from the thirty-first degree of north latitude, on the route\r\nfrom Athens to New Orleans, under such regulations as might be agreed\r\non between the Executive and the Spanish Government (March 3, 1807,\r\np. 117). The sixth from the foot of the rapids of the river Miami,\r\nof Lake Erie, to the western line of the Connecticut Reserve (December\r\n12, 1811, p. 364). The seventh from the Lower Sandusky to the boundary\r\nline established by the treaty of Greenville (same act). The eighth from\r\na point where the United States road leading from Vincennes to the\r\nIndian boundary line, established by the treaty of Greenville, strikes\r\nthe said line, to the North Bend, in the State of Ohio (January 8, 1812,\r\np. 367). The ninth for repairing and keeping in repair the road between\r\nColumbia, on Duck River, in Tennessee, and Madisonville, in Louisiana,\r\nand also the road between Fort Hawkins, in Georgia, and Fort Stoddard\r\n(April 27, 1816, p. 104 of the acts of that year). The tenth from the\r\nShawneetown, on the Ohio River, to the Sabine, and to Kaskaskias,\r\nin Illinois (April 27, 1816, p. 112). The eleventh from Reynoldsburg,\r\non Tennessee River, in the State of Tennessee, through the Chickasaw\r\nNation, to intersect the Natchez road near the Chickasaw old town (March\r\n3, 1817, p. 252). The twelfth: By this act authority was given to the\r\nPresident to appoint three commissioners for the purpose of examining\r\nthe country and laying out a road from the termination of the Cumberland\r\nroad, at Wheeling, on the Ohio, through the States of Ohio, Indiana,\r\nand Illinois, to a point to be chosen by them, on the left bank of the\r\nMississippi, between St. Louis and the mouth of the Illinois River, and\r\nto report an accurate plan of the said road, with an estimate of the\r\nexpense of making it. It is, however, declared by the act that nothing\r\nwas thereby intended to imply an obligation on the part of the United\r\nStates to make or defray the expense of making the said road or any part\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nIn the late war two other roads were made by the troops for military\r\npurposes--one from the Upper Sandusky, in the State of Ohio, through\r\nthe Black Swamp, toward Detroit, and another from Plattsburg, on Lake\r\nChamplain, through the Chatauga woods toward Sacketts Harbor, which have\r\nsince been repaired and improved by the troops. Of these latter there\r\nis no notice in the laws. The extra pay to the soldiers for repairing\r\nand improving those roads was advanced in the first instance from the\r\nappropriation to the Quartermaster's Department and afterwards provided\r\nfor by a specific appropriation by Congress. The necessity of keeping\r\nthose roads open and in good repair, being on the frontier, to\r\nfacilitate a communication between our posts, is apparent.\r\n\r\nAll of these roads except the first were formed merely by cutting down\r\nthe trees and throwing logs across, so as to make causeways over such\r\nparts as were otherwise impassable. The execution was of the coarsest\r\nkind. The Cumberland road is the only regular work which has been\r\nundertaken by the General Government or which could give rise to any\r\nquestion between the two Governments respecting its powers. It is a\r\ngreat work, over the highest mountains in our Union, connecting from\r\nthe seat of the General Government the Eastern with the Western waters,\r\nand more intimately the Atlantic with the Western States, in the\r\nformation of which $1,800,000 have been expended. The measures pursued\r\nin this case require to be particularly noticed as fixing the opinion\r\nof the parties, and particularly of Congress, on the important question\r\nof the right. Passing through Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia,\r\nit was thought necessary and proper to bring the subject before their\r\nrespective legislatures to obtain their sanction, which was granted by\r\neach State by a legislative act, approving the route and providing for\r\nthe purchase and condemnation of the land. This road was founded on an\r\narticle of compact between the United States and the State of Ohio,\r\nunder which that State came into the Union, and by which the expense\r\nattending it was to be defrayed by the application of a certain portion\r\nof the money arising from the sale of the public lands within that\r\nState. In this instance, which is by far the strongest in respect to\r\nthe expense, extent, and nature of the work done, the United States have\r\nexercised no act of jurisdiction or sovereignty within either of the\r\nStates by taking the land from the proprietors by force, by passing acts\r\nfor the protection of the road, or to raise a revenue from it by the\r\nestablishment of turnpikes and tolls, or any other act founded on the\r\nprinciple of jurisdiction or right. Whatever they have done has, on the\r\ncontrary, been founded on the opposite principle, on the voluntary and\r\nunqualified admission that the sovereignty belonged to the State and not\r\nto the United States, and that they could perform no act which should\r\ntend to weaken the power of the State or to assume any to themselves.\r\nAll that they have done has been to appropriate the public money to\r\nthe construction of this road and to cause it to be constructed, for\r\nI presume that no distinction can be taken between the appropriation\r\nof money raised by the sale of the public lands and of that which\r\narises from taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; nor can I believe that\r\nthe power to appropriate derives any sanction from a provision to that\r\neffect having been made by an article of compact between the United\r\nStates and the people of the then Territory of Ohio. This point may,\r\nhowever, be placed in a clearer light by a more particular notice of\r\nthe article itself.\r\n\r\nBy an act of April 30, 1802, entitled \"An act to enable the people of\r\nthe eastern division of the territory northwest of the river Ohio to\r\nform a constitution and State government, and for the admission of such\r\nState into the Union on an equal footing with the original States, and\r\nfor other purposes,\" after describing the limits of the proposed new\r\nState and authorizing the people thereof to elect a convention to\r\nform a constitution, the three following propositions were made to the\r\nconvention, to be obligatory on the United States if accepted by it:\r\nFirst, that section No. 16 of every township, or, where such section\r\nhad been sold, other lands equivalent thereto, should be granted to the\r\ninhabitants of such township for the use of free schools. Second, that\r\nthe 6 miles' reservation, including the salt springs commonly called\r\nthe Sciota Salt Springs, the salt springs near the Muskingum River and\r\nin the military tract, with the sections which include the same, should\r\nbe granted to the said State for the use of the people thereof, under\r\nsuch regulations as the legislature of the State should prescribe:\r\n_Provided_, That it should never sell or lease the same for more than\r\nten years. Third, that one twentieth part of the proceeds of the public\r\nlands lying within the said State which might be sold by Congress from\r\nand after the 30th June ensuing should be applied to the laying out and\r\nmaking public roads from the navigable waters emptying into the\r\nAtlantic, to the Ohio, and through the State of Ohio, such roads to be\r\nlaid out under the authority of Congress, with the consent of the\r\nseveral States through which they should pass.\r\n\r\nThese three propositions were made on the condition that the convention\r\nof the State should provide by an ordinance, irrevocable without the\r\nconsent of the United States, that every tract of land sold by Congress\r\nafter the 30th of June ensuing should remain for the term of five years\r\nafter sale exempt from every species of tax whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to read the ordinance of the 23d of April, 1784, or\r\nthe provisions of the act of April 30, 1802, which are founded on it,\r\nwithout being profoundly impressed with the enlightened and magnanimous\r\npolicy which dictated them. Anticipating that the new States would be\r\nsettled by the inhabitants of the original States and their offspring,\r\nno narrow or contracted jealousy was entertained of their admission\r\ninto the Union in equal participation in the national sovereignty with\r\nthe original States. It was foreseen at the early period at which that\r\nordinance passed that the expansion of our Union to the Lakes and to\r\nthe Mississippi and all its waters would not only make us a greater\r\npower, but cement the Union itself. These three propositions were well\r\ncalculated to promote these great results. A grant of land to each\r\ntownship for free schools, and of the salt springs to the State, which\r\nwere within its limits, for the use of its citizens, with 5 per cent of\r\nthe money to be raised from the sale of lands within the State for the\r\nconstruction of roads between the original States and the new State, and\r\nof other roads within the State, indicated a spirit not to be mistaken,\r\nnor could it fail to produce a corresponding effect in the bosoms of\r\nthose to whom it was addressed. For these considerations the sole return\r\nrequired of the convention was that the new State should not tax the\r\npublic lands which might be sold by the United States within it for the\r\nterm of five years after they should be sold. As the value of these\r\nlands would be enhanced by this exemption from taxes for that term, and\r\nfrom which the new State would derive its proportionable benefit, and\r\nas it would also promote the rapid sale of those lands, and with it\r\nthe augmentation of its own population, it can not be doubted, had this\r\nexemption been suggested unaccompanied by any propositions of particular\r\nadvantage, that the convention would, in consideration of the relation\r\nwhich had before existed between the parties, and was about to be so\r\nmuch improved, most willingly have acceded to it and without regarding\r\nit as an onerous condition.\r\n\r\nSince, then, it appears that the whole of the money to be employed in\r\nmaking this road was to be raised from the sale of the public lands, and\r\nwhich would still belong to the United States, although no mention had\r\nbeen made of them in the compact, it follows that the application of the\r\nmoney to that purpose stands upon the same ground as if such compact had\r\nnot been made, and in consequence that the example in favor of the right\r\nof appropriation is in no manner affected by it.\r\n\r\nThe same rule of construction of the right of appropriation has been\r\nobserved and the same liberal policy pursued toward the other new\r\nStates, with certain modifications adapted to the situation of each,\r\nwhich were adopted with the State of Ohio. As, however, the reasoning\r\nwhich is applicable to the compact with Ohio in relation to the right\r\nof appropriation, in which light only I have adverted to it, is equally\r\napplicable to the several compacts with the other new States, I deem it\r\nunnecessary to take a particular notice of them.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to observe that the money which was employed in the\r\nconstruction of all the other roads was taken directly from the\r\nTreasury. This fact affords an additional proof that in the\r\ncontemplation of Congress no difference existed in the application of\r\nmoney to those roads between that which was raised by the sale of lands\r\nand that which was derived from taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.\r\n\r\nSo far I have confined my remarks to the acts of Congress respecting the\r\nright of appropriation to such measures only as operate internally and\r\naffect the territory of the individual States. In adverting to those\r\nwhich operate externally and relate to foreign powers I find only two\r\nwhich appear to merit particular attention. These were gratuitous grants\r\nof money for the relief of foreigners in distress--the first in 1794\r\nto the inhabitants of St. Domingo, who sought an asylum on our coast\r\nfrom the convulsions and calamities of the island; the second in 1812\r\nto the people of Caracas, reduced to misery by an earthquake. The\r\nconsiderations which were applicable to these grants have already\r\nbeen noticed and need not be repeated.\r\n\r\nIn this examination of the right of appropriation I thought it proper\r\nto present to view also the practice of the Government under it, and to\r\nexplore the ground on which each example rested, that the precise nature\r\nand extent of the construction thereby given of the right might be\r\nclearly understood. The right to raise money would have given, as is\r\npresumed, the right to use it, although nothing had been said to that\r\neffect in the Constitution; and where the right to raise it is granted\r\nwithout special limitation, we must look for such limitation to other\r\ncauses. Our attention is first drawn to the right to appropriate, and\r\nnot finding it there we must then look to the general powers of the\r\nGovernment as designated by the specific grants and to the purposes\r\ncontemplated by them, allowing to this (the right to raise money), the\r\nfirst and most important of the enumerated powers, a scope which will\r\nbe competent to those purposes. The practice of the Government, as\r\nillustrated by numerous and strong examples directly applicable, ought\r\nsurely to have great weight in fixing the construction of each grant.\r\nIt ought, I presume, to settle it, especially where it is acquiesced\r\nin by the nation and produces a manifest and positive good. A practical\r\nconstruction, thus supported, shows that it has reason on its side and\r\nis called for by the interests of the Union. Hence, too, the presumption\r\nthat it will be persevered in. It will surely be better to admit that\r\nthe construction given by these examples has been just arid proper than\r\nto deny that construction and still to practice on it--to say one thing\r\nand to do another.\r\n\r\nWherein consists the danger of giving a liberal construction to the\r\nright of Congress to raise and appropriate the public money? It has\r\nbeen shown that its obvious effect is to secure the rights of the\r\nStates from encroachment and greater harmony in the political movement\r\nbetween the two governments, while it enlarges to a certain extent\r\nin the most harmless way the useful agency of the General Government\r\nfor all the purposes of its institution. Is not the responsibility of\r\nthe representative to his constituent in every branch of the General\r\nGovernment equally strong and as sensibly felt as in the State\r\ngovernments, and is not the security against abuse as effectual in the\r\none as in the other government? The history of the General Government\r\nin all its measures fully demonstrates that Congress will never venture\r\nto impose unnecessary burdens on the people or any that can be avoided.\r\nDuties and imposts have always been light, not greater, perhaps, than\r\nwould have been imposed for the encouragement of our manufactures had\r\nthere been no occasion for the revenue arising from them; and taxes and\r\nexcises have never been laid except in cases of necessity, and repealed\r\nas soon as the necessity ceased. Under this mild process and the sale\r\nof some hundreds of millions of acres of good land the Government will\r\nbe possessed of money, which may be applied with great advantage to\r\nnational purposes. Within the States only will it be applied, and,\r\nof course, for their benefit, it not being presumable that such appeals\r\nas were made to the benevolence of the country in the instances of\r\nthe inhabitants of St. Domingo and Caracas will often occur. How,\r\nthen, shall this revenue be applied? Should it be idle in the Treasury?\r\nThat our resources will be equal to such useful purposes I have no\r\ndoubt, especially if by completing our fortifications and raising and\r\nmaintaining our Navy at the point provided for immediately after the\r\nwar we sustain our present altitude and preserve by means thereof for\r\nany length of time the peace of the Union.\r\n\r\nWhen we hear charges raised against other governments of breaches\r\nof their constitutions, or, rather, of their charters, we always\r\nanticipate the most serious consequences--communities deprived of\r\nprivileges which they have long enjoyed, or individuals oppressed and\r\npunished in violation of the ordinary forms and guards of trial to\r\nwhich they were accustomed and entitled. How different is the situation\r\nof the United States! Nor can anything mark more strongly the great\r\ncharacteristics of that difference than the grounds on which like\r\ncharges are raised against this Government. It is not alleged that any\r\nportion of the community or any individual has been oppressed or that\r\nmoney has been raised under a doubtful title. The principal charges are\r\nthat a work of great utility to the Union and affecting immediately\r\nand with like advantage many of the States has been constructed; that\r\npensions to the surviving patriots of our Revolution, to patriots who\r\nfought the battles and promoted the independence of their country, have\r\nbeen granted, by money, too, raised not only without oppression, but\r\nalmost without being felt, and under an acknowledged constitutional\r\npower.\r\n\r\nFrom this view of the right to appropriate and of the practice under\r\nit I think that I am authorized to conclude that the right to make\r\ninternal improvements has not been granted by the power \"to pay the\r\ndebts and provide for the common defense and general welfare,\" included\r\nin the first of the enumerated powers; that that grant conveys nothing\r\nmore than a right to appropriate the public money, and stands on the\r\nsame ground with the right to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts,\r\nand excises, conveyed by the first branch of that power; that the\r\nGovernment itself being limited, both branches of the power to raise\r\nand appropriate the public money are also limited, the extent of the\r\nGovernment as designated by the specific grants marking the extent\r\nof the power in both branches, extending, however, to every object\r\nembraced by the fair scope of those grants and not confined to a strict\r\nconstruction of their respective powers, it being safer to aid the\r\npurposes of those grants by the appropriation of money than to extend\r\nby a forced construction the grant itself; that although the right to\r\nappropriate the public money to such improvements affords a resource\r\nindispensably necessary to such a scheme, it is nevertheless deficient\r\nas a power in the great characteristics on which its execution depends.\r\n\r\nThe substance of what has been urged on this subject may be expressed in\r\na few words. My idea is that Congress have an unlimited power to raise\r\nmoney, and that in its appropriation they have a discretionary power,\r\nrestricted only by the duty to appropriate it to purposes of common\r\ndefense and of general, not local, national, not State, benefit.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to the fifth source from which the power is said to\r\nbe derived, viz, the power to make all laws which shall be necessary\r\nand proper for carrying into execution all the powers vested by the\r\nConstitution in the Government of the United States or in any department\r\nor officer thereof. This is the seventeenth and last of the enumerated\r\npowers granted to Congress.\r\n\r\nI have always considered this power as having been granted on a\r\nprinciple of greater caution to secure the complete execution of all\r\nthe powers which had been vested in the General Government. It contains\r\nno distinct and specific power, as every other grant does, such as to\r\nlay and collect taxes, to declare war, to regulate commerce, and the\r\nlike. Looking to the whole scheme of the General Government, it gives\r\nto Congress authority to make all laws which should be deemed necessary\r\nand proper for carrying all its powers into effect. My impression has\r\nbeen invariably that this power would have existed substantially if this\r\ngrant had not been made; for why is any power granted unless it be to be\r\nexecuted when required, and how can it be executed under our Government\r\nunless it be by laws necessary and proper for the purpose--that is, well\r\nadapted to the end? It is a principle universally admitted that a grant\r\nof a power conveys as a necessary consequence or incident to it the\r\nmeans of carrying it into effect by a fair construction of its import.\r\nIn the formation, however, of the Constitution, which was to act\r\ndirectly upon the people and be paramount to the extent of its powers\r\nto the constitutions of the States, it was wise in its framers to leave\r\nnothing to implication which might be reduced to certainty. It is known\r\nthat all power which rests solely on that ground has been systematically\r\nand zealously opposed under all governments with which we have any\r\nacquaintance; and it was reasonable to presume that under our system,\r\nwhere there was a division of the sovereignty between the two\r\nindependent governments, the measures of the General Government would\r\nexcite equal jealousy and produce an opposition not less systematic,\r\nthough, perhaps, less violent. Hence the policy by the framers of our\r\nGovernment of securing by a fundamental declaration in the Constitution\r\na principle which in all other governments had been left to implication\r\nonly. The terms \"necessary\" and \"proper\" secure to the powers of all\r\nthe grants to which the authority given in this is applicable a fair\r\nand sound construction, which is equally binding as a rule on both\r\nGovernments and on all their departments.\r\n\r\nIn examining the right of the General Government to adopt and execute\r\nunder this grant a system of internal improvement the sole question\r\nto be decided is whether the power has been granted under any of the\r\nother grants. If it has, this power is applicable to it to the extent\r\nstated. If it has not, it does not exist at all, for it has not been\r\nhereby granted. I have already examined all the other grants (one only\r\nexcepted, which will next claim attention) and shown, as I presume, on\r\nthe most liberal construction of their powers that the right has not\r\nbeen granted by any of them; hence it follows that in regard to them\r\nit has not been granted by this.\r\n\r\nI come now to the last source from which this power is said to be\r\nderived, viz, the power to dispose of and make all needful rules and\r\nregulations respecting the territory or other property of the United\r\nStates, which is contained in the second clause of the third section\r\nof the fourth article of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nTo form a just opinion of the nature and extent of this power it will\r\nbe necessary to bring into view the provisions contained in the first\r\nclause of the section of the article referred to, which makes an\r\nessential part of the policy in question. By this it is declared that\r\nnew States shall be admitted into the Union, but that no new States\r\nshall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other State,\r\nnor any States be formed by the junction of two or more States or parts\r\nof States, without the consent of the legislatures of the States\r\nconcerned as well as of the United States.\r\n\r\nIf we recur to the condition of our country at the commencement of\r\nthe Revolution, we shall see the origin and cause of these provisions.\r\nBy the charters of the several colonies limits by latitude and other\r\ndescriptions were assigned to each. In commencing the Revolution the\r\ncolonies, as has already been observed, claimed by those limits,\r\nalthough their population extended in many instances to a small portion\r\nof the territory lying within them. It was contended by some of the\r\nStates after the declaration of independence that the vacant lands lying\r\nwithin any of the States should become the property of the Union, as by\r\na common exertion they would be acquired. This claim was resisted by the\r\nothers on the principle that all the States entered into the contest in\r\nthe full extent of their chartered rights, and that they ought to have\r\nthe full benefit of those rights in the event of success. Happily this\r\ncontroversy was settled, as all interfering claims and pretensions\r\nbetween the members of our Union and between the General Government and\r\nany of these members have been, in the most amicable manner and to the\r\nsatisfaction of all parties. On the recommendation of Congress the\r\nindividual States having such territory within their chartered limits\r\nceded large portions thereof to the United States on condition that it\r\nshould be laid off into districts of proper dimensions, the lands to\r\nbe sold for the benefit of the United States, and that the districts\r\nbe admitted into the Union when they should obtain such a population\r\nas it might be thought proper and reasonable to prescribe. This is the\r\nterritory and this the property referred to in the second clause of the\r\nfourth article of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAll the States which had made cessions of vacant territory except\r\nGeorgia had made them before the adoption of the Constitution, and\r\nthat State had made a proposition to Congress to that effect which\r\nwas under consideration at the time the Constitution was adopted. The\r\ncession was completed after the adoption of the Constitution. It was\r\nmade on the same principle and on similar conditions with those which\r\nhad been already made by the other States. As differences might arise\r\nrespecting the right or the policy in Congress to admit new States\r\ninto the Union under the new Government, or to make regulations for the\r\ngovernment of the territory ceded in the intermediate state, or for the\r\nimprovement and sale of the public lands, or to accept other cessions,\r\nit was thought proper to make special provisions for these objects,\r\nwhich was accordingly done by the above-recited clause in the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThus the power of Congress over the ceded territory was not only\r\nlimited to these special objects, but was also temporary. As soon as\r\nthe territory became a State the jurisdiction over it as it had before\r\nexisted ceased. It extended afterwards only to the unsold lands, and\r\nas soon as the whole were sold it ceased in that sense also altogether.\r\nFrom that moment the United States have no jurisdiction or power in the\r\nnew States other than in the old, nor can it be obtained except by an\r\namendment of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nSince, then, it is manifest that the power granted to Congress to\r\ndispose of and make all needful regulations respecting the territory\r\nand other property of the United States relates solely to the territory\r\nand property which had been ceded by individual States, and which after\r\nsuch cession lay without their respective limits, and for which special\r\nprovision was deemed necessary, the main power of the Constitution\r\noperating internally, not being applicable or adequate thereto, it\r\nfollows that this power gives no authority, and has even no bearing on\r\nthe question of internal improvement. The authority to admit new States\r\nand to dispose of the property and regulate the territory is not among\r\nthe enumerated powers granted to Congress, because the duties to be\r\nperformed under it are not among the ordinary duties of that body, like\r\nthe imposition of taxes, the regulation of commerce, and the like. They\r\nare objects in their nature special, and for which special provision was\r\nmore suitable and proper.\r\n\r\nHaving now examined all the powers of Congress under which the right\r\nto adopt and execute a system of internal improvement is claimed and\r\nthe reasons in support of it in each instance, I think that it may\r\nfairly be concluded that such a right has not been granted. It appears\r\nand is admitted that much may be done in aid of such a system by the\r\nright which is derived from several of the existing grants, and more\r\nespecially from that to appropriate the public money. But still it is\r\nmanifest that as a system for the United States it can never be carried\r\ninto effect under that grant nor under all of them united, the great\r\nand essential power being deficient, consisting of a right to take up\r\nthe subject on principle; to cause our Union to be examined by men of\r\nscience, with a view to such improvements; to authorize commissioners to\r\nlay off the roads and canals in all proper directions; to take the land\r\nat a valuation if necessary, and to construct the works; to pass laws\r\nwith suitable penalties for their protection; and to raise a revenue\r\nfrom them, to keep them in repair, and make further improvement by the\r\nestablishment of turnpikes and tolls, with gates to be placed at the\r\nproper distances.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be remarked that this power will operate, like many\r\nothers now existing, without affecting the sovereignty of the States\r\nexcept in the particular offices to be performed. The jurisdiction of\r\nthe several States may still exist over the roads and canals within\r\ntheir respective limits, extending alike to persons and property, as if\r\nthe right to make and protect such improvements had not been vested in\r\nCongress. The right, being made commensurate simply with the purposes\r\nindispensable to the system, may be strictly confined to them. The\r\nright of Congress to protect the works by laws imposing penalties would\r\noperate on the same principles as the right to protect the mail. The act\r\nbeing punishable only, a jurisdiction over the place would be altogether\r\nunnecessary and even absurd.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding inquiry little has been said of the advantages which\r\nwould attend the exercise of such a power by the General Government.\r\nI have made the inquiry under a deep conviction that they are almost\r\nincalculable, and that there was a general concurrence of opinion among\r\nour fellow-citizens to that effect. Still, it may not be improper for\r\nme to state the grounds upon which my own impression is founded. If it\r\nsheds no additional light on this interesting part of the subject, it\r\nwill at least show that I have had more than one powerful motive for\r\nmaking the inquiry. A general idea is all that I shall attempt.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of such a system must depend upon the interests to be\r\naffected by it and the extent to which they may be affected, and those\r\nmust depend on the capacity of our country for improvement and the means\r\nat its command applicable to that object.\r\n\r\nI think that I may venture to affirm that there is no part of our globe\r\ncomprehending so many degrees of latitude on the main ocean and so\r\nmany degrees of longitude into the interior that admits of such great\r\nimprovement and at so little expense. The Atlantic on the one side, and\r\nthe Lakes, forming almost inland seas, on the other, separated by high\r\nmountains, which rise in the valley of the St. Lawrence and determine\r\nin that of the Mississippi, traversing from north to south almost the\r\nwhole interior, with innumerable rivers on every side of those mountains,\r\nsome of vast extent, many of which take their sources near to each other,\r\ngive the great outline. The details are to be seen on the valuable maps\r\nof our country.\r\n\r\nIt appears by the light already before the public that it is practicable\r\nand easy to connect by canals the whole coast from its southern to its\r\nnorthern extremity in one continued inland navigation, and to connect in\r\nlike manner in many parts the Western lakes and rivers with each other.\r\nIt is equally practicable and easy to facilitate the intercourse between\r\nthe Atlantic and the Western country by improving the navigation of\r\nmany of the rivers which have their sources near to each other in the\r\nmountains on each side, and by good roads across the mountains between\r\nthe highest navigable points of those rivers. In addition to the example\r\nof the Cumberland road, already noticed, another of this kind is now in\r\ntrain from the head waters of the river James to those of the Kanawha;\r\nand in like manner may the Savannah be connected with the Tennessee. In\r\nsome instances it is understood that the Eastern and Western waters may\r\nbe connected together directly by canals. One great work of this kind is\r\nnow in its progress and far advanced in the State of New York, and there\r\nis good reason to believe that two others may be formed, one at each\r\nextremity of the high mountains above mentioned, connecting in the one\r\ninstance the waters of the St. Lawrence with Lake Champlain, and in\r\nthe other some of the most important of the Western rivers with those\r\nemptying into the Gulf of Mexico, the advantage of which will be seen\r\nat the first glance by an enlightened observer.\r\n\r\nGreat improvements may also be made by good roads in proper directions\r\nthrough the interior of the country. As these roads would be laid out\r\non principle on a full view of the country, its mountains, rivers, etc.,\r\nit would be useless, if I had the knowledge, to go into detail respecting\r\nthem. Much has been done by some of the States, but yet much remains to\r\nbe done with a view to the Union.\r\n\r\nUnder the colonial governments improvements of this kind were not\r\nthought of. There was, it is believed, not one canal and little\r\ncommunication from colony to colony. It was their policy to encourage\r\nthe intercourse between each colony and the parent country only. The\r\nroads which were attended to were those which led from the interior of\r\neach colony to its principal towns on the navigable waters. By those\r\nroutes the produce of the country was carried to the coast, and shipped\r\nthence to the mercantile houses in London, Liverpool, Glasgow, or other\r\ntowns to which the trade was carried on. It is believed that there was\r\nbut one connected route from North to South at the commencement of the\r\nRevolution, and that a very imperfect one. The existence and principle\r\nof our Union point out the necessity of a very different policy.\r\n\r\nThe advantages which would be derived from such improvements are\r\nincalculable. The facility which would thereby be afforded to the\r\ntransportation of the whole of the rich productions of our country\r\nto market would alone more than amply compensate for all the labor\r\nand expense attending them. Great, however, as is that advantage, it\r\nis one only of many and by no means the most important, Every power of\r\nthe General Government and of the State governments connected with the\r\nstrength and resources of the country would be made more efficient\r\nfor the purposes intended by them. In war they would facilitate the\r\ntransportation of men, ordnance, and provisions, and munitions of war of\r\nevery kind to every part of our extensive coast and interior on which an\r\nattack might be made or threatened. Those who have any knowledge of the\r\noccurrences of the late war must know the good effect which would result\r\nin the event of another war from the command of an interior navigation\r\nalone along the coast for all the purposes of war as well as of commerce\r\nbetween the different parts of our Union. The impediments to all\r\nmilitary operations which proceeded from the want of such a navigation\r\nand the reliance which was placed, notwithstanding those impediments,\r\non such a commerce can not be forgotten. In every other line their\r\ngood effect would be most sensibly felt. Intelligence by means of the\r\nPost-Office Department would be more easily, extensively, and rapidly\r\ndiffused. Parts the most remote from each other would be brought more\r\nclosely together. Distant lands would be made more valuable, and the\r\nindustry of our fellow-citizens on every portion of our soil be better\r\nrewarded.\r\n\r\nIt is natural in so great a variety of climate that there should be\r\na corresponding difference in the produce of the soil; that one part\r\nshould raise what the other might want. It is equally natural that the\r\npursuits of industry should vary in like manner; that labor should be\r\ncheaper and manufactures succeed better in one part than in another;\r\nthat were the climate the most severe and the soil less productive,\r\nnavigation, the fisheries, and commerce should be most relied on.\r\nHence the motive for an exchange for mutual accommodation and active\r\nintercourse between them. Each part would thus find for the surplus\r\nof its labor, in whatever article it consisted, an extensive market\r\nat home, which would be the most profitable because free from duty.\r\n\r\nThere is another view in which these improvements are of still more\r\nvital importance. The effect which they would have on the bond of union\r\nitself affords an inducement for them more powerful than any which have\r\nbeen urged or than all of them united. The only danger to which our\r\nsystem is exposed arises from its expansion over a vast territory.\r\nOur union is not held together by standing armies or by any ties other\r\nthan the positive interests and powerful attractions of its parts toward\r\neach other. Ambitious men may hereafter grow up among us who may promise\r\nto themselves advancement from a change, and by practicing upon the\r\nsectional interests, feelings, and prejudices endeavor under various\r\npretexts to promote it. The history of the world is replete with\r\nexamples of this kind--of military commanders and demagogues becoming\r\nusurpers and tyrants, and of their fellow-citizens becoming their\r\ninstruments and slaves. I have little fear of this danger, knowing well\r\nhow strong the bond which holds us together is and who the people are\r\nwho are thus held together; but still, it is proper to look at and to\r\nprovide against it, and it is not within the compass of human wisdom\r\nto make a more effectual provision than would be made by the proposed\r\nimprovements. With their aid and the intercourse which would grow out\r\nof them the parts would soon become so compacted and bound together\r\nthat nothing could break it.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of our Union over a vast territory can not operate\r\nunfavorably to the States individually. On the contrary, it is believed\r\nthat the greater the expansion within practicable limits--and it is not\r\neasy to say what are not so--the greater the advantage which the States\r\nindividually will derive from it. With governments separate, vigorous,\r\nand efficient for all local purposes, their distance from each other can\r\nhave no injurious effect upon their respective interests. It has already\r\nbeen shown that in some important circumstances, especially with the aid\r\nof these improvements, they must derive great advantage from that cause\r\nalone--that is, from their distance from each other. In every other way\r\nthe expansion of our system must operate favorably for every State in\r\nproportion as it operates favorably for the Union. It is in that sense\r\nonly that it can become a question with the States, or, rather, with\r\nthe people who compose them. As States they can be affected by it only\r\nby their relation to each other through the General Government and by\r\nits effect on the operations of that Government. Manifest it is that to\r\nany extent to which the General Government can sustain and execute its\r\nfunctions with complete effect will the States--that is, the people who\r\ncompose them--be benefited. It is only when the expansion shall be\r\ncarried beyond the faculties of the General Government so as to enfeeble\r\nits operations to the injury of the whole that any of the parts can be\r\ninjured. The tendency in that stage will be to dismemberment and not to\r\nconsolidation. This danger should, therefore, be looked at with profound\r\nattention as one of a very serious character. I will remark here that\r\nas the operations of the National Government are of a general nature,\r\nthe States having complete power for internal and local purposes, the\r\nexpansion may be carried to very great extent and with perfect safety.\r\nIt must be obvious to all that the further the expansion is carried,\r\nprovided it be not beyond the just limit, the greater will be the\r\nfreedom of action to both Governments and the more perfect their\r\nsecurity, and in all other respects the better the effect will be to\r\nthe whole American people. Extent of territory, whether it be great\r\nor small, gives to a nation many of its characteristics. It marks the\r\nextent of its resources, of its population, of its physical force.\r\nIt marks, in short, the difference between a great and a small power.\r\n\r\nTo what extent it may be proper to expand our system of government is a\r\nquestion which does not press for a decision at this time. At the end of\r\nthe Revolutionary war, in 1783, we had, as we contended and believed,\r\na right to the free navigation of the Mississippi, but it was not until\r\nafter the expiration of twelve years, in 1795, that that right was\r\nacknowledged and enjoyed. Further difficulties occurred in the bustling\r\nof a contentious world when, at the expiration of eight years more, the\r\nUnited States, sustaining the strength and energy of their character,\r\nacquired the Province of Louisiana, with the free navigation of the\r\nriver from its source to the ocean and a liberal boundary on the western\r\nside. To this Florida has since been added, so that we now possess all\r\nthe territory in which the original States had any interest, or in which\r\nthe existing States can be said, either in a national or local point\r\nof view, to be in any way interested. A range of States on the western\r\nside of the Mississippi, which already is provided for, puts us\r\nessentially at ease. Whether it will be wise to go further will turn\r\non other considerations than those which have dictated the course\r\nheretofore pursued. At whatever point we may stop, whether it be at\r\na single range of States beyond the Mississippi or by taking a greater\r\nscope, the advantage of such improvements is deemed of the highest\r\nimportance. It is so on the present scale. The further we go the greater\r\nwill be the necessity for them.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that improvements for great national purposes\r\nwould be better made by the National Government than by the governments\r\nof the several States. Our experience prior to the adoption of the\r\nConstitution demonstrated that in the exercise by the individual States\r\nof most of the powers granted to the United States a contracted rivalry\r\nof interest and misapplied jealousy of each other had an important\r\ninfluence on all their measures to the great injury of the whole. This\r\nwas particularly exemplified by the regulations which they severally\r\nmade of their commerce with foreign nations and with each other. It\r\nwas this utter incapacity in the State governments, proceeding from\r\nthese and other causes, to act as a nation and to perform all the duties\r\nwhich the nation owed to itself under any system which left the General\r\nGovernment dependent on the States, which produced the transfer of\r\nthese powers to the United States by the establishment of the present\r\nConstitution. The reasoning which was applicable to the grant of any of\r\nthe powers now vested in Congress is likewise so, at least to a certain\r\nextent, to that in question. It is natural that the States individually\r\nin making improvements should look to their particular and local\r\ninterests, The members composing their respective legislatures represent\r\nthe people of each State only, and might not feel themselves at liberty\r\nto look to objects in these respects beyond that limit. If the resources\r\nof the Union were to be brought into operation under the direction of\r\nthe State assemblies, or in concert with them, it may be apprehended\r\nthat every measure would become the object of negotiation, of bargain\r\nand barter, much to the disadvantage of the system, as well as discredit\r\nto both governments. But Congress would look to the whole and make\r\nimprovements to promote the welfare of the whole. It is the peculiar\r\nfelicity of the proposed amendment that while it will enable the United\r\nStates to accomplish every national object, the improvements made with\r\nthat view will eminently promote the welfare of the individual States,\r\nwho may also add such others as their own particular interests may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the Cumberland road requires the particular and early\r\nattention of Congress. Being formed over very lofty mountains and in\r\nmany instances over deep and wide streams, across which valuable bridges\r\nhave been erected, which are sustained by stone walls, as are many other\r\nparts of the road, all these works are subject to decay, have decayed,\r\nand will decay rapidly unless timely and effectual measures are adopted\r\nto prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe declivities from the mountains and all the heights must suffer from\r\nthe frequent and heavy falls of water and its descent to the valleys,\r\nas also from the deep congelations during our severe winters. Other\r\ninjuries have also been experienced on this road, such as the displacing\r\nthe capping of the walls and other works, committed by worthless people\r\neither from a desire to render the road impassable or to have the\r\ntransportation in another direction, or from a spirit of wantonness to\r\ncreate employment for idlers. These considerations show that an active\r\nand strict police ought to be established over the whole road, with\r\npower to make repairs when necessary, to establish turnpikes and tolls\r\nas the means of raising money to make them, and to prosecute and punish\r\nthose who commit waste and other injuries.\r\n\r\nShould the United States be willing to abandon this road to the States\r\nthrough which it passes, would they take charge of it, each of that\r\nportion within its limits, and keep it in repair? It is not to be\r\npresumed that they would, since the advantages attending it are\r\nexclusively national, by connecting, as it does, the Atlantic with the\r\nWestern States, and in a line with the seat of the National Government.\r\nThe most expensive parts of this road lie within Pennsylvania and\r\nVirginia, very near the confines of each State and in a route not\r\nessentially connected with the commerce of either.\r\n\r\nIf it is thought proper to vest this power in the United States,\r\nthe only mode in which it can be done is by an amendment of the\r\nConstitution. The States individually can not transfer the power\r\nto the United States, nor can the United States receive it. The\r\nConstitution forms an equal and the sole relation between the General\r\nGovernment and the several States, and it recognizes no change in it\r\nwhich shall not in like manner apply to all. If it is once admitted\r\nthat the General Government may form compacts with individual States\r\nnot common to the others, and which the others might even disapprove,\r\ninto what pernicious consequences might it not lead? Such compacts are\r\nutterly repugnant to the principles of the Constitution and of the most\r\ndangerous tendency. The States through which this road passes have given\r\ntheir sanction only to the route and to the acquisition of the soil\r\nby the United States, a right very different from that of jurisdiction,\r\nwhich can not be granted without an amendment to the Constitution, and\r\nwhich need not be granted for the purposes of this system except in the\r\nlimited manner heretofore stated. On full consideration, therefore, of\r\nthe whole subject I am of opinion that such an amendment ought to be\r\nrecommended to the several States for their adoption.\r\n\r\nI have now essentially executed that part of the task which I imposed\r\non myself of examining the right of Congress to adopt and execute a\r\nsystem of internal improvement, and, I presume, have shown that it does\r\nnot exist. It is, I think, equally manifest that such a power vested in\r\nCongress and wisely executed would have the happiest effect on all the\r\ngreat interests of our Union. It is, however, my opinion that the power\r\nshould be confined to great national works only, since if it were\r\nunlimited it would be liable to abuse and might be productive of evil.\r\nFor all minor improvements the resources of the States individually\r\nwould be fully adequate, and by the States such improvements might be\r\nmade with greater advantage than by the Union, as they would understand\r\nbetter such as their more immediate and local interests required.\r\n\r\nIn the view above presented I have thought it proper to trace the\r\norigin of our institutions, and particularly of the State and National\r\nGovernments, for although they have a common origin in the people, yet,\r\nas the point at issue turned on what were the powers granted to the\r\none government and what were those which remained to the other, I was\r\npersuaded that an analysis which should mark distinctly the source of\r\npower in both governments, with its progress in each, would afford the\r\nbest means for obtaining a sound result. In our political career there\r\nare, obviously, three great epochs. The colonial state forms the first;\r\nthe Revolutionary movement from its commencement to the adoption of the\r\nArticles of Confederation the second, and the intervening space from\r\nthat event to the present day the third. The first may be considered\r\nthe infant state. It was the school of morality, of political science\r\nand just principles. The equality of rights enjoyed by the people of\r\nevery colony under their original charters forms the basis of every\r\nexisting institution, and it was owing to the creation by those\r\ncharters of distinct communities that the power, when wrested from the\r\nCrown, passed directly and exclusively to the people of each colony.\r\nThe Revolutionary struggle gave activity to those principles, and its\r\nsuccess secured to them a permanent existence in the governments\r\nof our Union, State and National. The third epoch comprises the\r\nadministration under the Articles of Confederation, with the adoption\r\nof the Constitution and administration under it. On the first and\r\nlast of these epochs it is not necessary to enlarge for any purpose\r\nconnected with the object of this inquiry. To the second, in which we\r\nwere transferred by a heroic exertion from the first to the third stage,\r\nand whose events give the true character to every institution, some\r\nfurther attention is due. In tracing in greater detail the prominent\r\nacts of a movement to which we owe so much I shall perform an office\r\nwhich, if not useful, will be gratifying to my own feelings, and I hope\r\nnot unacceptable to my readers.\r\n\r\nOf the Revolutionary movement itself sentiments too respectful, too\r\nexalted, can not be entertained. It is impossible for any citizen having\r\na just idea of the dangers which we had to encounter to read the record\r\nof our early proceedings and to see the firmness with which they were\r\nmet and the wisdom and patriotism which were displayed in every stage\r\nwithout being deeply affected by it. An attack on Massachusetts was\r\nconsidered an attack on every colony, and the people of each moved in\r\nher defense as in their own cause. The meeting of the General Congress\r\nin Philadelphia on the 6th of September, 1774, appears to have been\r\nthe result of a spontaneous impulse in every quarter at the same time.\r\nThe first public act proposing it, according to the Journals of\r\nthe First Congress, was passed by the house of representatives of\r\nConnecticut on the 3d of June of that year; but it is presumed that the\r\nfirst suggestion came from Massachusetts, the colony most oppressed,\r\nand in whose favor the general sympathy was much excited. The exposition\r\nwhich that Congress made of grievances, in the petition to the King, in\r\nthe address to the people of Great Britain, and in that to the people\r\nof the several colonies, evinced a knowledge so profound of the English\r\nconstitution and of the general principles of free government and of\r\nliberty, of our rights founded on that constitution and on the charters\r\nof the several colonies, and of the numerous and egregious violations\r\nwhich had been committed of them, as must have convinced all impartial\r\nminds that the talent on this side of the Atlantic was at least equal\r\nto that on the other. The spirit in which those papers were drawn, which\r\nwas known to be in strict accord with the public sentiment, proved that,\r\nalthough the whole people cherished a connection with the parent country\r\nand were desirous of preserving it on just principles, they nevertheless\r\nstood embodied at the parting line, ready to separate forever if\r\na redress of grievances, the alternative offered, was not promptly\r\nrendered. That alternative was rejected, and in consequence war and\r\ndismemberment followed.\r\n\r\nThe powers granted to the delegates of each colony who composed the\r\nFirst Congress looked primarily to the support of rights and to a\r\nredress of grievances, and, in consequence, to the restoration of\r\nharmony, which was ardently desired. They justified, however, any\r\nextremity in case of necessity. They were ample for such purposes,\r\nand were executed in every circumstance with the utmost fidelity.\r\nIt was not until after the meeting of the Second Congress, which took\r\nplace on the 10th May, 1775, when full proof was laid before it of the\r\ncommencement of hostilities in the preceding month by a deliberate\r\nattack of the British troops on the militia and inhabitants of Lexington\r\nand Concord, in Massachusetts, that war might be said to be decided on,\r\nand measures were taken to support it. The progress even then was slow\r\nand reluctant, as will be seen by their second petition to the King and\r\ntheir second address to the people of Great Britain, which were prepared\r\nand forwarded after that event. The arrival, however, of large bodies of\r\ntroops and the pressure of war in every direction soon dispelled all\r\nhope of accommodation.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of June, 1775, a commander in chief of the forces raised and\r\nto be raised for the defense of American liberty was appointed by the\r\nunanimous vote of Congress, and his conduct in the discharge of the\r\nduties of that high trust, which he held through the whole of the war,\r\nhas given an example to the world for talents as a military commander;\r\nfor integrity, fortitude, and firmness under the severest trials; for\r\nrespect to the civil authority and devotion to the rights and liberties\r\nof his country, of which neither Rome nor Greece have exhibited the\r\nequal. I saw him in my earliest youth, in the retreat through Jersey,\r\nat the head of a small band, or rather in its rear, for he was always\r\nnext the enemy, and his countenance and manner made an impression on me\r\nwhich time can never efface. A lieutenant then in the Third Virginia\r\nRegiment, I happened to be on the rear guard at Newark, and I counted\r\nthe force under his immediate command by platoons as it passed me, which\r\namounted to less than 3,000 men. A deportment so firm, so dignified,\r\nso exalted, but yet so modest and composed, I have never seen in any\r\nother person.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th July, 1775, Congress published a declaration of the causes\r\nwhich compelled them to take up arms, and immediately afterwards took\r\nmeasures for augmenting the Army and raising a navy; for organizing the\r\nmilitia and providing cannon and small arms and military stores of every\r\nkind; for raising a revenue and pushing the war offensively with all the\r\nmeans in their power. Nothing escaped the attention of that enlightened\r\nbody. The people of Canada were invited to join the Union, and a force\r\nsent into the province to favor the Revolutionary party, which, however,\r\nwas not capable of affording any essential aid. The people of Ireland\r\nwere addressed in terms manifesting due respect for the sufferings, the\r\ntalents, and patriotism of that portion of the British Empire, and a\r\nsuitable acknowledgment was made to the assembly of Jamaica for the\r\napprobation it had expressed of our cause and the part it had taken\r\nin support of it with the British Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of June, 1775, the convention of Massachusetts, by a letter\r\nsigned by their president, of May the 10th, stated to Congress that they\r\nlabored under difficulties for the want of a regular form of government,\r\nand requested to be favored with explicit advice respecting the taking\r\nup and exercising the powers of civil government, and declaring their\r\nreadiness to submit to such a general plan as the Congress might direct\r\nfor the colonies, or that they would make it their great study to\r\nestablish such a form of government there as should not only promote\r\ntheir own advantage, but the union and interest of all America. To this\r\napplication an answer was given on the 9th, by which it was recommended\r\nto the convention \"to write letters to the inhabitants of the several\r\nplaces entitled to representation in assembly, requesting them to choose\r\nsuch representatives, and that the assembly, when chosen, should elect\r\ncouncilors, and that said assembly or council should exercise the powers\r\nof government until a governor of His Majesty's appointment will consent\r\nto govern the colony according to its charter.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 18th October of the same year the delegates from New Hampshire\r\nlaid before Congress an instruction from their convention \"to use their\r\nutmost endeavors to obtain the advice and direction of Congress with\r\nrespect to a method for administering justice and regulating their civil\r\npolice.\" To this a reply was given on the 3d November, by which it was\r\nrecommended to the convention \"to call a full and free representation of\r\nthe people, and that the representatives, if they thought it necessary,\r\nshould establish such a form of government as in their judgment would\r\nbest promote the happiness of the people and most effectually secure\r\npeace and good order in the Province during the continuance of the\r\npresent dispute between Great Britain and the colonies.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th November it was resolved by Congress \"that if the convention\r\nof South Carolina shall find it necessary to establish a form of\r\ngovernment in that colony it be recommended to that convention to\r\ncall a full and free representation of the people; and the said\r\nrepresentatives, if they think it necessary, shall establish such a\r\nform of government as in their judgment will best promote the happiness\r\nof the people and most effectually secure peace and good order in the\r\ncolony during the continuance of the present dispute between Great\r\nBritain and the colonies.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 4th December following a resolution passed recommending the same\r\nmeasure, and precisely in the same words, to the convention of Virginia.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th May, 1776, it was recommended to the respective assemblies\r\nand conventions of the united colonies, where no government sufficient\r\nto the exigencies of their affairs had been established, \"to adopt such\r\ngovernment as should, in the opinion of the representatives of the\r\npeople, best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents\r\nin particular and America in general.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 7th June resolutions respecting independence were moved and\r\nseconded, which were referred to a committee of the whole on the 8th\r\nand 10th, on which latter day it was resolved to postpone a decision on\r\nthe first resolution or main question until the 1st July, but that no\r\ntime might be lost in case the Congress agree thereto that a committee\r\nbe appointed to prepare a declaration to the effect of that resolution.\r\nOn the 11th June, 1776, Congress appointed a committee to prepare and\r\ndigest a plan of confederation for the colonies. On the 12th July the\r\ncommittee reported a draft of articles, which were severally afterwards\r\ndebated and amended until the 15th November, 1777, when they were\r\nadopted. These articles were then proposed to the legislatures of the\r\nseveral States, with a request that if approved by them they would\r\nauthorize their delegates to ratify the same in Congress, and, which\r\nbeing done, to become conclusive. It was not until the 21st of March,\r\n1781, as already observed, that they were ratified by the last State\r\nand carried into effect.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th July, 1776, independence was declared by an act which\r\narrested the attention of the civilized world and will bear the test\r\nof time. For force and condensation of matter, strength of reason,\r\nsublimity of sentiment and expression, it is believed that no document\r\nof equal merit exists. It looked to everything, and with a reach,\r\nperspicuity, and energy of mind which seemed to be master of everything.\r\n\r\nThus it appears, in addition to the very important charge of managing\r\nthe war, that Congress had under consideration at the same time the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, the adoption of a confederation for the\r\nStates, and the propriety of instituting State governments, with the\r\nnature of those governments, respecting which it had been consulted by\r\nthe conventions of several of the colonies. So great a trust was never\r\nreposed before in a body thus constituted, and I am authorized to add,\r\nlooking to the great result, that never were duties more ably or\r\nfaithfully performed.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characteristic of this movement is that although the\r\nconnection which had existed between the people of the several colonies\r\nbefore their dismemberment from the parent country was not only not\r\ndissolved but increased by that event, even before the adoption of the\r\nArticles of Confederation, yet the preservation and augmentation of that\r\ntie were the result of a new creation, and proceeded altogether from\r\nthe people of each colony, into whose hands the whole power passed\r\nexclusively when wrested from the Crown. To the same cause the greater\r\nchange which has since occurred by the adoption of the Constitution is\r\nto be traced.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of our institutions forms the most important epoch\r\nthat history hath recorded. They extend unexampled felicity to the whole\r\nbody of our fellow-citizens, and are the admiration of other nations.\r\nTo preserve and hand them down in their utmost purity to the remotest\r\nages will require the existence and practice of virtues and talents\r\nequal to those which were displayed in acquiring them. It is ardently\r\nhoped and confidently believed that these will not be wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas by the second section of an act of Congress of the 6th of May\r\nlast, entitled \"An act in addition to the act concerning navigation,\r\nand also to authorize the appointment of deputy collectors,\" it is\r\nprovided that in the event of the signature of any treaty or convention\r\nconcerning the navigation or commerce between the United States and\r\nFrance the President of the United States, if he should deem the same\r\nexpedient, may suspend by proclamation until the end of the next session\r\nof Congress the operation of the act entitled \"An act to impose a new\r\ntonnage duty on French ships and vessels, and for other purposes,\" and\r\nalso to suspend, as aforesaid, all other duties on French vessels or\r\nthe goods imported in the same which may exceed the duties on American\r\nvessels and on similar goods imported in the same; and\r\n\r\nWhereas a convention of navigation and commerce between the United\r\nStates of America and His Majesty the King of France and Navarre has\r\nthis day been duly signed by John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State, on\r\nthe part of the United States, and by the Baron Hyde de Neuville, envoy\r\nextraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from France, on the part of\r\nHis Most Christian Majesty, which convention is in the words following:\r\n\r\n[Here follows the treaty.]\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I, James Monroe, President of the\r\nUnited States, in pursuance of the authority aforesaid, do hereby\r\nsuspend from and after the 1st day of October next until the end of\r\nthe next session of Congress, the operation of the act aforesaid,\r\nentitled \"An act to impose a new tonnage duty on French ships and\r\nvessels, and for other purposes,\" and also all other duties on French\r\nvessels and the goods being the growth, produce, and manufacture of\r\nFrance imported in the same which may exceed the duties on American\r\nvessels and on similar goods imported in the same, saving only the\r\ndiscriminating duties payable on French vessels and on articles the\r\ngrowth, produce, and manufacture of France imported in the same\r\nstipulated by the said convention to be paid.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be\r\naffixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at Washington, the 24th day of June, A.D. 1822, and of the\r\nIndependence of the-United States the forty-sixth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  JOHN QUINCY ADAMS,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of the Congress of the United States passed on the\r\n6th day of May last it was provided that on satisfactory evidence being\r\ngiven to the President of the United States that the ports in the\r\nislands or colonies in the West Indies under the dominion of Great\r\nBritain have been opened to the vessels of the United States the\r\nPresident should be, and thereby was, authorized to issue his\r\nproclamation declaring that the ports of the United States should\r\nthereafter be open to the vessels of Great Britain employed in the trade\r\nand intercourse between the United States and such islands or colonies,\r\nsubject to such reciprocal rules and restrictions as the President of\r\nthe United States might by such proclamation make and publish, anything\r\nin the laws entitled \"An act concerning navigation\" or an act entitled\r\n\"An act supplementary to an act concerning navigation\" to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding; and\r\n\r\nWhereas satisfactory evidence has been given to the President of the\r\nUnited States that the ports hereinafter named in the islands or\r\ncolonies in the West Indies under the dominion of Great Britain have\r\nbeen opened to the vessels of the United States;

The operation of our laws on the various subjects to\r\nwhich they apply, with the amendments which they occasionally require,\r\nimposes annually an important duty on the representatives of a free\r\npeople. Our system has happily advanced to such maturity that I am not\r\naware that your cares in that respect will be augmented. Other causes\r\nexist which are highly interesting to the whole civilized world, and to\r\nno portion of it more so, in certain views, than to the United States.\r\nOf these causes and of their bearing on the interests of our Union I\r\nshall communicate the sentiments which I have formed with that freedom\r\nwhich a sense of duty dictates. It is proper, however, to invite your\r\nattention in the first instance to those concerns respecting which\r\nlegislative provision is thought to be particularly urgent.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June last a convention of navigation and commerce was\r\nconcluded in this city between the United States and France by ministers\r\nduly authorized for the purpose. The sanction of the Executive having\r\nbeen given to this convention under a conviction that, taking all its\r\nstipulations into view, it rested essentially on a basis of reciprocal\r\nand equal advantage, I deemed it my duty, in compliance with the\r\nauthority vested in the Executive by the second section of the act of\r\nthe last session of the 6th of May, concerning navigation, to suspend by\r\nproclamation until the end of the next session of Congress the operation\r\nof the act entitled \"An act to impose a new tonnage duty on French ships\r\nand vessels, and for other purposes,\" and to suspend likewise all other\r\nduties on French vessels or the goods imported in them which exceeded\r\nthe duties on American vessels and on similar goods imported in them.\r\nI shall submit this convention forthwith to the Senate for its advice\r\nand consent as to the ratification.\r\n\r\nSince your last session the prohibition which had been imposed on the\r\ncommerce between the United States and the British colonies in the West\r\nIndies and on this continent has likewise been removed. Satisfactory\r\nevidence having been adduced that the ports of those colonies had been\r\nopened to the vessels of the United States by an act of the British\r\nParliament bearing date on the 24th of June last, on the conditions\r\nspecified therein, I deemed it proper, in compliance with the provision\r\nof the first section of the act of the last session above recited, to\r\ndeclare, by proclamation bearing date on the 24th of August last, that\r\nthe ports of the United States should thenceforward and until the end of\r\nthe next session of Congress be opened to the vessels of Great Britain\r\nemployed in that trade, under the limitation specified in that\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\nA doubt was entertained whether the act of Congress applied to the\r\nBritish colonies on this continent as well as to those in the West\r\nIndies, but as the act of Parliament opened the intercourse equally\r\nwith both, and it was the manifest intention of Congress, as well as\r\nthe obvious policy of the United States, that the provisions of the act\r\nof Parliament should be met in equal extent on the part of the United\r\nStates, and as also the act of Congress was supposed to vest in the\r\nPresident some discretion in the execution of it, I thought it advisable\r\nto give it a corresponding construction.\r\n\r\nShould the constitutional sanction of the Senate be given to the\r\nratification of the convention with France, legislative provisions will\r\nbe necessary to carry it fully into effect, as it likewise will be to\r\ncontinue in force, on such conditions as may be deemed just and proper,\r\nthe intercourse which has been opened between the United States and the\r\nBritish colonies. Every light in the possession of the Executive will\r\nin due time be communicated on both subjects.\r\n\r\nResting essentially on a basis of reciprocal and equal advantage, it\r\nhas been the object of the Executive in transactions with other powers\r\nto meet the propositions of each with a liberal spirit, believing that\r\nthereby the interest of our country would be most effectually promoted.\r\nThis course has been systematically pursued in the late occurrences with\r\nFrance and Great Britain, and in strict accord with the views of the\r\nLegislature. A confident hope is entertained that by the arrangement\r\nthus commenced with each all differences respecting navigation and\r\ncommerce with the dominions in question will be adjusted, and a solid\r\nfoundation be laid for an active and permanent intercourse which will\r\nprove equally advantageous to both parties.\r\n\r\nThe decision of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia on the\r\nquestion submitted to him by the United States and Great Britain,\r\nconcerning the construction of the first article of the treaty of Ghent,\r\nhas been received. A convention has since been concluded between the\r\nparties, under the mediation of His Imperial Majesty, to prescribe the\r\nmode by which that article shall be carried into effect in conformity\r\nwith that decision. I shall submit this convention to the Senate for\r\nits advice and consent as to the ratification, and, if obtained, shall\r\nimmediately bring the subject before Congress for such provisions as\r\nmay require the interposition of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with an act of the last session a Territorial government\r\nhas been established in Florida on the principles of our system. By\r\nthis act the inhabitants are secured in the full enjoyment of their\r\nrights and liberties, and to admission into the Union, with equal\r\nparticipation in the Government with the original States on the\r\nconditions heretofore prescribed to other Territories. By a clause in\r\nthe ninth article of the treaty with Spain, by which that Territory was\r\nceded to the United States, it is stipulated that satisfaction shall\r\nbe made for the injuries, if any, which by process of law shall be\r\nestablished to have been suffered by the Spanish officers and individual\r\nSpanish inhabitants by the late operations of our troops in Florida. No\r\nprovision having yet been made to carry that stipulation into effect,\r\nit is submitted to the consideration of Congress whether it will not be\r\nproper to vest the competent power in the district court at Pensacola,\r\nor in some tribunal to be specially organized for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe fiscal operations of the year have been more successful than had\r\nbeen anticipated at the commencement of the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the three first quarters of the\r\nyear have exceeded the sum of $14,745,000. The payments made at the\r\nTreasury during the same period have exceeded $12,279,000, leaving in\r\nthe Treasury on the 30th day of September last, including $1,168,592.24\r\nwhich were in the Treasury on the 1st day of January last, a sum\r\nexceeding $4,128,000.\r\n\r\nBesides discharging all demands for the current service of the year,\r\nincluding the interest and reimbursement of the public debt, the 6 per\r\ncent stock of 1796, amounting to $80,000, has been redeemed. It is\r\nestimated that, after defraying the current expenses of the present\r\nquarter and redeeming the two millions of 6 per cent stock of 1820,\r\nthere will remain in the Treasury on the 1st of January next nearly\r\n$3,000,000. It is estimated that the gross amount of duties which have\r\nbeen secured from the 1st of January to the 30th of September last has\r\nexceeded $19,500,000, and the amount for the whole year will probably\r\nnot fall short of $23,000,000.\r\n\r\nOf the actual force in service under the present military establishment,\r\nthe posts at which it is stationed, and the condition of each post,\r\na report from the Secretary of War which is now communicated will give\r\na distinct idea. By like reports the state of the Academy at West Point\r\nwill be seen, as will be the progress which has been made on the\r\nfortifications along the coast and at the national armories and\r\narsenals.\r\n\r\nThe position on the Red River and that at the Sault of St. Marie are\r\nthe only new posts that have been taken. These posts, with those\r\nalready occupied in the interior, are thought to be well adapted to the\r\nprotection of our frontiers. All the force not placed in the garrisons\r\nalong the coast and in the ordnance depots, and indispensably necessary\r\nthere, is placed on the frontiers.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the several corps composing the Army is such as to\r\nadmit its expansion to a great extent in case of emergency, the officers\r\ncarrying with them all the light which they possess to the new corps to\r\nwhich they might be appointed.\r\n\r\nWith the organization of the staff there is equal cause to be satisfied.\r\nBy the concentration of every branch with its chief in this city, in\r\nthe presence of the Department, and with a grade in the chief military\r\nstation to keep alive and cherish a military spirit, the greatest\r\npromptitude in the execution of orders, with the greatest economy and\r\nefficiency, are secured. The same view is taken of the Military Academy.\r\nGood order is preserved in it, and the youth are well instructed in\r\nevery science connected with the great objects of the institution. They\r\nare also well trained and disciplined in the practical parts of the\r\nprofession. It has been always found difficult to control the ardor\r\ninseparable from that early age in such manner as to give it a proper\r\ndirection. The rights of manhood are too often claimed prematurely, in\r\npressing which too far the respect which is due to age and the obedience\r\nnecessary to a course of study and instruction in every such institution\r\nare sometimes lost sight of. The great object to be accomplished is the\r\nrestraint of that ardor by such wise regulations and government as, by\r\ndirecting all the energies of the youthful mind to the attainment of\r\nuseful knowledge, will keep it within a just subordination and at the\r\nsame time elevate it to the highest purposes. This object seems to be\r\nessentially obtained in this institution, and with great advantage to\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy forms the basis, in regard to science, on which\r\nthe military establishment rests. It furnishes annually, after due\r\nexamination and on the report of the academic staff, many well-informed\r\nyouths to fill the vacancies which occur in the several corps of the\r\nArmy, while others who retire to private life carry with them such\r\nattainments as, under the right reserved to the several States to\r\nappoint the officers and to train the militia, will enable them, by\r\naffording a wider field for selection, to promote the great object of\r\nthe power vested in Congress of providing for the organizing, arming,\r\nand disciplining the militia. Thus by the mutual and harmonious\r\ncooperation of the two governments in the execution of a power divided\r\nbetween them, an object always to be cherished, the attainment of a\r\ngreat result, on which our liberties may depend, can not fail to be\r\nsecured. I have to add that in proportion as our regular force is small\r\nshould the instruction and discipline of the militia, the great resource\r\non which we rely, be pushed to the utmost extent that circumstances\r\nwill admit.\r\n\r\nA report from the Secretary of the Navy will communicate the progress\r\nwhich has been made in the construction of vessels of war, with other\r\ninteresting details respecting the actual state of the affairs of\r\nthat Department. It has been found necessary for the protection of\r\nour commerce to maintain the usual squadrons on the Mediterranean,\r\nthe Pacific, and along the Atlantic coast, extending the cruises of the\r\nlatter into the West Indies, where piracy, organized into a system, has\r\npreyed on the commerce of every country trading thither. A cruise has\r\nalso been maintained on the coast of Africa, when the season would\r\npermit, for the suppression of the slave trade, and orders have been\r\ngiven to the commanders of all our public ships to seize our own\r\nvessels, should they find any engaged in that trade, and to bring\r\nthem in for adjudication.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies piracy is of recent date, which may explain the\r\ncause why other powers have not combined against it. By the documents\r\ncommunicated it will be seen that the efforts of the United States to\r\nsuppress it have had a very salutary effect. The benevolent provision\r\nof the act under which the protection has been extended alike to the\r\ncommerce of other nations can not fail to be duly appreciated by them.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the act of the last session entitled \"An act\r\nto abolish the United States trading establishments,\" agents were\r\nimmediately appointed and instructed, under the direction of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, to close the business of the trading houses\r\namong the Indian tribes and to settle the accounts of the factors and\r\nsubfactors engaged in that trade, and to execute in all other respects\r\nthe injunctions of that act in the mode prescribed therein. A final\r\nreport of their proceedings shall be communicated to Congress as soon\r\nas it is received.\r\n\r\nIt is with great regret I have to state that a serious malady has\r\ndeprived us of many valuable citizens at Pensacola and checked the\r\nprogress of some of those arrangements which are important to the\r\nTerritory. This effect has been sensibly felt in respect to the Indians\r\nwho inhabit that Territory, consisting of the remnants of several tribes\r\nwho occupy the middle ground between St. Augustine and Pensacola, with\r\nextensive claims but undefined boundaries. Although peace is preserved\r\nwith those Indians, yet their position and claims tend essentially to\r\ninterrupt the intercourse between the eastern and western parts of the\r\nTerritory, on which our inhabitants are principally settled. It is\r\nessential to the growth and prosperity of the Territory, as well as to\r\nthe interests of the Union, that these Indians should be removed, by\r\nspecial compact with them, to some other position or concentrated within\r\nnarrower limits where they are. With the limited means in the power of\r\nthe Executive, instructions were given to the governor to accomplish\r\nthis object so far as it might be practicable, which was prevented by\r\nthe distressing malady referred to. To carry it fully into effect in\r\neither mode additional funds will be necessary, to the provision of\r\nwhich the powers of Congress alone are competent. With a view to such\r\nprovision as may be deemed proper, the subject is submitted to your\r\nconsideration, and in the interim further proceedings are suspended.\r\n\r\nIt appearing that so much of the act entitled \"An act regulating the\r\nstaff of the Army,\" which passed on the 14th April, 1818, as relates to\r\nthe commissariat will expire in April next, and the practical operation\r\nof that department having evinced its great utility, the propriety of\r\nits renewal is submitted to your consideration.\r\n\r\nThe view which has been taken of the probable productiveness of the\r\nlead mines, connected with the importance of the material to the public\r\ndefense, makes it expedient that they should be managed with peculiar\r\ncare. It is therefore suggested whether it will not comport with the\r\npublic interest to provide by law for the appointment of an agent\r\nskilled in mineralogy to superintend them, under the direction of\r\nthe proper department.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the Cumberland road, which was constructed at\r\na great expense, has already suffered from the want of that regular\r\nsuperintendence and of those repairs which are indispensable to the\r\npreservation of such a work. This road is of incalculable advantage\r\nin facilitating the intercourse between the Western and the Atlantic\r\nStates. Through it the whole country from the northern extremity of Lake\r\nErie to the Mississippi, and from all the waters which empty into each,\r\nfinds an easy and direct communication to the seat of Government, and\r\nthence to the Atlantic. The facility which it affords to all military\r\nand commercial operations, and also to those of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment, can not be estimated too highly. This great work is likewise\r\nan ornament and an honor to the nation. Believing that a competent power\r\nto adopt and execute a system of internal improvement has not been\r\ngranted to Congress, but that such a power, confined to great national\r\npurposes and with proper limitations, would be productive of eminent\r\nadvantage to our Union, I have thought it advisable that an amendment\r\nof the Constitution to that effect should be recommended to the several\r\nStates. A bill which assumed the right to adopt and execute such a\r\nsystem having been presented for my signature at the last session,\r\nI was compelled, from the view which I had taken of the powers of the\r\nGeneral Government, to negative it, on which occasion I thought it\r\nproper to communicate the sentiments which I had formed, on mature\r\nconsideration, on the whole subject. To that communication, in all the\r\nviews in which the great interest to which it relates may be supposed\r\nto merit your attention, I have now to refer. Should Congress, however,\r\ndeem it improper to recommend such an amendment, they have, according to\r\nmy judgment, the right to keep the road in repair by providing for the\r\nsuperintendence of it and appropriating the money necessary for repairs.\r\nSurely if they had the right to appropriate money to make the road they\r\nhave a right to appropriate it to preserve the road from ruin. From the\r\nexercise of this power no danger is to be apprehended. Under our happy\r\nsystem the people are the sole and exclusive fountain of power. Each\r\ngovernment originates from them, and to them alone, each to its proper\r\nconstituents, are they respectively and solely responsible for the\r\nfaithful discharge of their duties within their constitutional limits;\r\nand that the people will confine their public agents of every station\r\nto the strict line of their constitutional duties there is no cause to\r\ndoubt. Having, however, communicated my sentiments to Congress at the\r\nlast session fully in the document to which I have referred, respecting\r\nthe right of appropriation as distinct from the right of jurisdiction\r\nand sovereignty over the territory in question, I deem it improper to\r\nenlarge on the subject here.\r\n\r\nFrom the best information that I have been able to obtain it appears\r\nthat our manufactures, though depressed immediately after the peace,\r\nhave considerably increased, and are still increasing, under the\r\nencouragement given them by the tariff of 1816 and by subsequent\r\nlaws. Satisfied I am, whatever may be the abstract doctrine in favor of\r\nunrestricted commerce, provided all nations would, concur in it and it\r\nwas not liable to be interrupted by war, which has never occurred and\r\ncan not be expected, that there are other strong reasons applicable to\r\nour situation and relations with other countries which impose on us the\r\nobligation to cherish and sustain our manufactures. Satisfied, however,\r\nI likewise am that the interest of every part of our Union, even of\r\nthose most benefited by manufactures, requires that this subject should\r\nbe touched with the greatest caution, and a critical knowledge of\r\nthe effect to be produced by the slightest change. On full consideration\r\nof the subject in all its relations I am persuaded that a further\r\naugmentation may now be made of the duties on certain foreign articles\r\nin favor of our own and without affecting injuriously any other\r\ninterest. For more precise details I refer you to the communications\r\nwhich were made to Congress during the last session.\r\n\r\nSo great was the amount of accounts for moneys advanced during the late\r\nwar, in addition to others of a previous date which in the regular\r\noperations of the Government necessarily remained unsettled, that it\r\nrequired a considerable length of time for their adjustment. By a report\r\nfrom the First Comptroller of the Treasury it appears that on the 4th of\r\nMarch, 1817, the accounts then unsettled amounted to $103,068,876.41, of\r\nwhich, on the 30th of September of the present year, $93,175,396.56 had\r\nbeen settled, leaving on that day a balance unsettled of $9,893,479.85.\r\nThat there have been drawn from the Treasury, in paying the public debt\r\nand sustaining the Government in all its operations and disbursements,\r\nsince the 4th of March, 1817, $157,199,380.96, the accounts for which\r\nhave been settled to the amount of $137,501,451.12, leaving a balance\r\nunsettled of $19,697,929.84. For precise details respecting each of\r\nthese balances I refer to the report of the Comptroller and the\r\ndocuments which accompany it.\r\n\r\nFrom this view it appears that our commercial differences with France\r\nand Great Britain have been placed in a train of amicable arrangement on\r\nconditions fair and honorable in both instances to each party; that our\r\nfinances are in a very productive state, our revenue being at present\r\nfully competent to all the demands upon it; that our military force is\r\nwell organized in all its branches and capable of rendering the most\r\nimportant service in case of emergency that its number will admit of;\r\nthat due progress has been made, under existing appropriations, in the\r\nconstruction of fortifications and in the operations of the Ordnance\r\nDepartment; that due progress has in like manner been made in the\r\nconstruction of ships of war; that our Navy is in the best condition,\r\nfelt and respected in every sea in which it is employed for the\r\nprotection of our commerce; that our manufactures have augmented in\r\namount and improved in quality; that great progress has been made in\r\nthe settlement of accounts and in the recovery of the balances due by\r\nindividuals, and that the utmost economy is secured and observed in\r\nevery Department of the Administration.\r\n\r\nOther objects will likewise claim your attention, because from the\r\nstation which the United States hold as a member of the great community\r\nof nations they have rights to maintain, duties to perform, and dangers\r\nto encounter.\r\n\r\nA strong hope was entertained that peace would ere this have been\r\nconcluded between Spain and the independent governments south of the\r\nUnited States in this hemisphere. Long experience having evinced the\r\ncompetency of those governments to maintain the independence which they\r\nhad declared, it was presumed that the considerations which induced\r\ntheir recognition by the United States would have had equal weight with\r\nother powers, and that Spain herself, yielding to those magnanimous\r\nfeelings of which her history furnishes so many examples, would have\r\nterminated on that basis a controversy so unavailing and at the same\r\ntime so destructive. We still cherish the hope that this result will\r\nnot long be postponed.\r\n\r\nSustaining our neutral position and allowing to each party while the war\r\ncontinues equal rights, it is incumbent on the United States to claim of\r\neach with equal rigor the faithful observance of our rights according to\r\nthe well-known law of nations. From each, therefore, a like cooperation\r\nis expected in the suppression of the piratical practice which has grown\r\nout of this war and of blockades of extensive coasts on both seas,\r\nwhich, considering the small force employed to sustain them, have not\r\nthe slightest foundation to rest on.\r\n\r\nEurope is still unsettled, and although the war long menaced between\r\nRussia and Turkey has not broken out, there is no certainty that the\r\ndifferences between those powers will be amicably adjusted. It is\r\nimpossible to look to the oppressions of the country respecting which\r\nthose differences arose without being deeply affected. The mention of\r\nGreece fills the mind with the most exalted sentiments and arouses\r\nin our bosoms the best feelings of which our nature is susceptible.\r\nSuperior skill and refinement in the arts, heroic gallantry in action,\r\ndisinterested patriotism, enthusiastic zeal and devotion in favor of\r\npublic and personal liberty are associated with our recollections of\r\nancient Greece. That such a country should have been overwhelmed and so\r\nlong hidden, as it were, from the world under a gloomy despotism has\r\nbeen a cause of unceasing and deep regret to generous minds for ages\r\npast. It was natural, therefore, that the reappearance of those people\r\nin their original character, contending in favor of their liberties,\r\nshould produce that great excitement and sympathy in their favor which\r\nhave been so signally displayed throughout the United States. A strong\r\nhope is entertained that these people will recover their independence\r\nand resume their equal station among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nA great effort has been made in Spain and Portugal to improve the\r\ncondition of the people, and it must be very consoling to all benevolent\r\nminds to see the extraordinary moderation with which it has been\r\nconducted. That it may promote the happiness of both nations is the\r\nardent wish of this whole people, to the expression of which we confine\r\nourselves; for whatever may be the feelings or sentiments which every\r\nindividual under our Government has a right to indulge and express,\r\nit is nevertheless a sacred maxim, equally with the Government and\r\npeople, that the destiny of every independent nation in what relates\r\nto such improvements of right belongs and ought to be left exclusively\r\nto themselves.\r\n\r\nWhether we reason from the late wars or from those menacing symptoms\r\nwhich now appear in Europe, it is manifest that if a convulsion should\r\ntake place in any of those countries it will proceed from causes which\r\nhave no existence and are utterly unknown in these States, in which\r\nthere is but one order, that of the people, to whom the sovereignty\r\nexclusively belongs. Should war break out in any of those countries, who\r\ncan foretell the extent to which it may be carried or the desolation\r\nwhich it may spread? Exempt as we are from these causes, our internal\r\ntranquillity is secure; and distant as we are from the troubled scene,\r\nand faithful to first principles in regard to other powers, we might\r\nreasonably presume that we should not be molested by them. This,\r\nhowever, ought not to be calculated on as certain. Unprovoked injuries\r\nare often inflicted, and even the peculiar felicity of our situation\r\nmight with some be a cause for excitement and aggression. The history\r\nof the late wars in Europe furnishes a complete demonstration that no\r\nsystem of conduct, however correct in principle, can protect neutral\r\npowers from injury from any party; that a defenseless position and\r\ndistinguished love of peace are the surest invitations to war, and that\r\nthere is no way to avoid it other than by being always prepared and\r\nwilling for just cause to meet it. If there be a people on earth whose\r\nmore especial duty it is to be at all times prepared to defend the\r\nrights with which they are blessed, and to surpass all others in\r\nsustaining the necessary burdens, and in submitting to sacrifices to\r\nmake such preparations, it is undoubtedly the people of these States.\r\n\r\nWhen we see that a civil war of the most frightful character rages\r\nfrom the Adriatic to the Black Sea; that strong symptoms of war appear\r\nin other parts, proceeding from causes which, should it break out, may\r\nbecome general and be of long duration; that the war still continues\r\nbetween Spain and the independent governments, her late Provinces,\r\nin this hemisphere; that it is likewise menaced between Portugal and\r\nBrazil, in consequence of the attempt of the latter to dismember\r\nitself from the former, and that a system of piracy of great extent is\r\nmaintained in the neighboring seas, which will require equal vigilance\r\nand decision to suppress it, the reasons for sustaining the attitude\r\nwhich we now hold and for pushing forward all our measures of defense\r\nwith the utmost vigor appear to me to acquire new force.\r\n\r\nThe United States owe to the world a great example, and, by means\r\nthereof, to the cause of liberty and humanity a generous support.\r\nThey have so far succeeded to the satisfaction of the virtuous and\r\nenlightened of every country. There is no reason to doubt that their\r\nwhole movement will be regulated by a sacred regard to principle, all\r\nour institutions being founded on that basis. The ability to support our\r\nown cause under any trial to which it may be exposed is the great point\r\non which the public solicitude rests. It has been often charged against\r\nfree governments that they have neither the foresight nor the virtue to\r\nprovide at the proper season for great emergencies; that their course is\r\nimprovident and expensive; that war will always find them unprepared,\r\nand, whatever may be its calamities, that its terrible warnings will\r\nbe disregarded and forgotten as soon as peace returns. I have full\r\nconfidence that this charge so far as relates to the United States\r\nwill be shewn to be utterly destitute of truth.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 4, 1822.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe convention between the United States and France, concluded at\r\nWashington on the 24th day of June last, is now transmitted to the\r\nSenate for their advice and consent with regard to its ratification,\r\ntogether with the documents relating to the negotiation, which may serve\r\nto elucidate the deliberations of the Senate concerning its objects and\r\nthe purposes to which it was adapted.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 4, 1822.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for their constitutional\r\nconsideration and decision thereon, a convention between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain, concluded at St. Petersburg on the 12th day\r\nof July last, under the mediation of His Imperial Majesty of all the\r\nRussias, together with the documents appertaining thereto, and which\r\nmay elucidate the motives for its negotiation and the objects for the\r\naccomplishment of which it is intended.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 6, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n7th of May last, requiring that a plan for the peace establishment of\r\nthe Navy of the United States and also of the Marine Corps should be\r\ncommunicated to that House at the present session, I transmit a report\r\nof the Secretary of the Navy, containing a plan which has been prepared\r\nfor the proposed establishment.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 8th of May last,\r\nrequesting \"information relative to the copper mines on the southern\r\nshore of Lake Superior, their number, value, and position, the names of\r\nthe Indian tribes who claim them, the practicability of extinguishing\r\ntheir titles, and the probable advantages which may result to the\r\nRepublic from the acquisition and working these mines,\" I herewith\r\ntransmit a report from the Secretary of War, which comprises the\r\ninformation desired in the resolution referred to.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 9, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nRecent information of the multiplied outrages and depredations which\r\nhave been committed on our seamen and commerce by the pirates in the\r\nWest Indies and Gulf of Mexico, exemplified by the death of a very\r\nmeritorious officer, seems to call for some prompt and decisive measures\r\non the part of the Government. All the public vessels adapted to that\r\nservice which can be spared from other indispensable duties are already\r\nemployed in it; but from the knowledge which has been acquired of the\r\nplaces from whence these outlaws issue and to which they escape from\r\ndanger it appears that it will require a particular kind of force,\r\ncapable of pursuing them into the shallow waters to which they retire,\r\neffectually to suppress them. I submit to the consideration of the\r\nSenate the propriety of organizing such force for that important object.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n[The same message, dated December 6, 1822, was sent to the House of\r\nRepresentatives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 9, 1822_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 22d of February\r\nlast, \"requesting the President of the United States to cause to be\r\ncollected and communicated to the Senate at the commencement of the next\r\nsession of Congress the best information which he may be able to obtain\r\nrelative to certain Christian Indians and the lands intended for their\r\nbenefit on the Muskingum, in the State of Ohio, granted under an act\r\nof Congress of June 1, 1796, to the Society of the United Brethren\r\nfor Propagating the Gospel among the Heathen, showing as correctly as\r\npossible the advance or decline of said Indians in numbers, morals, and\r\nintellectual endowments; whether the lands have inured to their sole\r\nbenefit, and, if not, to whom, in whole or in part, have such benefits\r\naccrued,\" I transmit a report from the Secretary of War with the\r\naccompanying documents.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 3, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the three resolutions of the Senate of the 5th April,\r\n1822, requesting the President of the United States to communicate in\r\ndetail the expenses of building each vessel of war authorized by the act\r\nof the 2d of January, 1813, and its supplements, and also the names,\r\nnumber, grade, etc., of the officers and men employed at each navy-yard\r\nand naval station during the two years immediately preceding the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1822, I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, with the accompanying documents, which contains the desired\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 3, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolutions of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 8th of January, 7th May, and 17th December, 1822, requesting the\r\nPresident of the United States to cause to be laid before that House a\r\ndetailed statement of the current expenses of the Ordnance Department\r\nfor the years 1817, 1818, 1819, 1820, and 1821, and as much as can be\r\nshewn for the year 1822, and also the number and local position of each\r\nof the armories, arsenals, and magazines of the United States, the total\r\nexpense of constructing and repairing the same up to the year 1821; the\r\nnumber of cannon and other arms annually made at each, and the expenses\r\nof each armory and arsenal for each year from 1816 to 1821, inclusive,\r\nI herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of War, accompanied by\r\nsuch documents as will be found to contain the desired information.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 3, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of the 19th of December, 1822, requesting the President of\r\nthe United States to cause to be laid before that House the several laws\r\nwhich have been made by the governor and legislative council of Florida,\r\ntogether with such information as may be in the possession of the\r\nExecutive, I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of State,\r\nwith the accompanying documents, which contains the information desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 6, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n19th of December last, requesting the President of the United States\r\nto communicate to the House the progress which has been made in the\r\nexecution of the act of the last session entitled \"An act to abolish\r\nthe Indian trading establishments,\" with a report from the factories,\r\nrespectively, as the same were made to him, I transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, with the documents referred to by that\r\nresolution.

1823.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n12th of December last, requesting the President \"to communicate to the\r\nHouse such information as he might possess with regard to any expedition\r\nprepared in the United States and having sailed from thence within the\r\nyear 1822 against the

Those documents contain all the\r\ninformation in possession of the Executive relating to the subject of\r\nthe resolution.\r\n\r\nThat a force of a very limited extent has been equipped in the ports\r\nof the United States and sailed from thence for the purpose described\r\nin the resolution is manifest from the documents now communicated. The\r\nreports from the collectors of Philadelphia and New York will shew in\r\nwhat manner this equipment escaped their notice.\r\n\r\nThe first information of this equipment was received from St.\r\nBartholomews, the place of its rendezvous. This was confirmed afterwards\r\nfrom Curracoa with an account of its failure. Should any of those\r\npersons return within the jurisdiction of the United States care will\r\nbe taken that the laws applicable to such offenses are duly enforced\r\nagainst them. Whether any aid was afforded by others to the parties\r\nengaged in this unlawful and contemptible adventure in the ports in\r\nwhich it was planned, inconsistent with ordinary commercial transactions\r\nand contrary to the laws of the United States, will be referred to the\r\nAttorney-General, on whose advice any measures in regard to them will\r\ndepend.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 6, 1823.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 28th of January last, requesting information \"whether the treaty\r\nconcluded with the Choctaw Nation of Indians on the 18th of October,\r\n1820, has been executed so far as respects the cession of certain lands\r\nto said nation west of the river Mississippi, and if possession has been\r\ngiven of the lands ceded to them;

whether the Government thereof was claimed by any European\r\nnation, what our commercial relations with the Government of the island\r\nwere, and whether any further commercial relations with that Government\r\nwould be consistent with the interest and safety of the United States.\r\n\r\nFrom the import of the resolution it is inferred that the Senate were\r\nfully aware of the delicate and interesting nature of the subject\r\nembraced by it in all its branches. The call supposes something peculiar\r\nin the nature of the Government of that island and in the character of\r\nits population, to which attention is due. Impressed always with an\r\nanxious desire to meet every call of either House for information,\r\nI most willingly comply in this instance and with a view to the\r\nparticular circumstances alluded to.\r\n\r\nIn adverting to the political state of St. Domingo I have to observe\r\nthat the whole island is now united under one Government, under a\r\nconstitution which retains the sovereignty in the hands of the people\r\nof color, and with provisions which prohibit the employment in the\r\nGovernment of all white persons who have emigrated there since 1816,\r\nor who may hereafter emigrate there, and which prohibit also the\r\nacquisition by such persons of the right of citizenship or to real\r\nestate in the island. In the exercise of this sovereignty the Government\r\nhas not been molested by any European, power. No invasion of the island\r\nhas been made or attempted by any power. It is, however, understood that\r\nthe relations between the Government of France and the island have not\r\nbeen adjusted, that its independence has not been recognized by France,\r\nnor has peace been formally established between the parties.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of a Government of people of color in the island on\r\nthe principles above stated evinces distinctly the idea of a separate\r\ninterest and a distrust of other nations. Had that jealousy been\r\nconfined to the inhabitants of the parent country it would have been\r\nless an object of attention; but by extending it to the inhabitants of\r\nother countries with whom no difference ever existed the policy assumes\r\na character which does not admit of a like explanation. To what extent\r\nthat spirit may be indulged or to what purposes applied our experience\r\nhas yet been too limited to enable us to form a just estimate. These\r\nare inquiries more peculiarly interesting to the neighboring islands.\r\nThey nevertheless deserve the attention of the United States.\r\n\r\nBetween the United States and the island a commercial intercourse\r\nexists, and it will continue to be the object of this Government to\r\npromote it. Our commerce there has been subjected to higher duties than\r\nhave been imposed on like articles from some other nations. It has\r\nnevertheless been extensive, proceeding from the wants of the respective\r\nparties and the enterprise of our citizens. Of this discrimination\r\nto our injury we had a right to complain and have complained. It is\r\nexpected that our commercial intercourse with the island will be placed\r\non the footing of the most favored nation. No preference is sought\r\nin our favor, nor ought any to be given to others. Regarding the high\r\ninterest of our happy Union and looking to every circumstance which\r\nmay by any possibility affect the tranquillity of any part, however\r\nremotely, and guarding against such injury by suitable precautions, it\r\nis the duty of this Government to promote by all the means in its power\r\nand by a fair and honorable policy the best interest of every other\r\npart, and thereby of the whole. Feeling profoundly the force of this\r\nobligation, I shall continue to exert with unwearied zeal my best\r\nfaculties to give it effect.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 26, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives, in pursuance of a resolution\r\nof that House of the 30th January last, a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, containing the information required in relation to the\r\ntransactions of the commissioners under the sixth and seventh articles\r\nof the treaty of Ghent, and also as to the measures which have been\r\ntaken under the fourth article of the treaty with Spain of the 22d of\r\nFebruary, 1819, for fixing the boundary line described in the third\r\narticle of the last-mentioned treaty.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 27, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, made in pursuance of their resolution of the 21st of January\r\nlast, requesting the President of the United States to cause to be\r\narranged and laid before that House a digest shewing such changes in the\r\ncommercial regulations of the different foreign countries with which the\r\nUnited States have intercourse as shall have been adopted and come to\r\nthe knowledge of the Executive subsequently to the formation of the\r\ndigest communicated to the Senate on the 7th December, 1819.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, with copies of sundry papers which should have been included\r\namong those which accompanied my message of the 13th instant, being part\r\nof the correspondence with Great Britain relating to the negotiation of\r\nthe convention of 20th of October, 1818, but which were accidentally\r\nomitted from the papers communicated to the House with that message.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n24th of January, requesting the President to communicate to the House\r\nthe number of persons and the amount due from each whose compensation\r\nhas been withheld or suspended, in pursuance of the law prohibiting\r\npayments to persons in arrears to the United States; whether the amount\r\nwithheld has been applied in all cases to the extinguishment of their\r\ndebts to the Government; whether the said laws have been enforced in\r\nall cases against securities who are liable for the payment of any\r\narrears due; whether any disbursing officer, within the knowledge of\r\nthe President, has given conclusive evidence of his insolvency, and,\r\nif so, whether he is still retained in the service of the United States,\r\nI transmit to the House a report from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nwith the documents mentioned therein.\r\n\r\nThe report has been confined to the operations of the law. Respecting\r\nthe circumstances of individuals in their transactions without the\r\nsphere of their public duties I have no means of information other\r\nthan those which are common to all.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 7, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of this\r\nday, requesting information of the measures taken with regard to the\r\nillegal blockade of the ports of the Spanish Main, and to depredations\r\nof privateers fitted out from Porto Rico and other Spanish islands on\r\nthe commerce of the United States, I transmit to the House a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of State containing the information required by\r\nthe resolution.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 2, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nMany important subjects will claim your attention during the\r\npresent session, of which I shall endeavor to give, in aid of your\r\ndeliberations, a just idea in this communication. I undertake this duty\r\nwith diffidence, from the vast extent of the interests on which I have\r\nto treat and of their great importance to every portion of our Union.\r\nI enter on it with zeal from a thorough conviction that there never\r\nwas a period since the establishment of our Revolution when, regarding\r\nthe condition of the civilized world and its bearing on us, there\r\nwas greater necessity for devotion in the public servants to their\r\nrespective duties, or for virtue, patriotism, and union in our\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nMeeting in you a new Congress, I deem it proper to present this view\r\nof public affairs in greater detail than might otherwise be necessary.\r\nI do it, however, with peculiar satisfaction, from a knowledge that in\r\nthis respect I shall comply more fully with the sound principles of our\r\nGovernment. The people being with us exclusively the sovereign, it is\r\nindispensable that full information be laid before them on all important\r\nsubjects, to enable them to exercise that high power with complete\r\neffect. If kept in the dark, they must be incompetent to it. We are\r\nall liable to error, and those who are engaged in the management of\r\npublic affairs are more subject to excitement and to be led astray by\r\ntheir particular interests and passions than the great body of our\r\nconstituents, who, living at home in the pursuit of their ordinary\r\navocations, are calm but deeply interested spectators of events and\r\nof the conduct of those who are parties to them. To the people\r\nevery department of the Government and every individual in each are\r\nresponsible, and the more full their information the better they can\r\njudge of the wisdom of the policy pursued and of the conduct of each in\r\nregard to it. From their dispassionate judgment much aid may always be\r\nobtained, while their approbation will form the greatest incentive\r\nand most gratifying reward for virtuous actions, and the dread of\r\ntheir censure the best security against the abuse of their confidence.\r\nTheir interests in all vital questions are the same, and the bond, by\r\nsentiment as well as by interest, will be proportionably strengthened as\r\nthey are better informed of the real state of public affairs, especially\r\nin difficult conjunctures. It is by such knowledge that local prejudices\r\nand jealousies are surmounted, and that a national policy, extending its\r\nfostering care and protection to all the great interests of our Union,\r\nis formed and steadily adhered to.\r\n\r\nA precise knowledge of our relations with foreign powers as respects our\r\nnegotiations and transactions with each is thought to be particularly\r\nnecessary. Equally necessary is it that we should form a just estimate\r\nof our resources, revenue, and progress in every kind of improvement\r\nconnected with the national prosperity and public defense. It is by\r\nrendering justice to other nations that we may expect it from them.\r\nIt is by our ability to resent injuries and redress wrongs that we may\r\navoid them. The commissioners under the fifth article of the treaty of\r\nGhent, having disagreed in their opinions respecting that portion of\r\nthe boundary between the Territories of the United States and of Great\r\nBritain the establishment of which had been submitted to them, have\r\nmade their respective reports in compliance with that article, that\r\nthe same might be referred to the decision of a friendly power. It\r\nbeing manifest, however, that it would be difficult, if not impossible,\r\nfor any power to perform that office without great delay and much\r\ninconvenience to itself, a proposal has been made by this Government,\r\nand acceded to by that of Great Britain, to endeavor to establish that\r\nboundary by amicable negotiation. It appearing from long experience\r\nthat no satisfactory arrangement could be formed of the commercial\r\nintercourse between the United States and the British colonies in this\r\nhemisphere by legislative acts while each party pursued its own course\r\nwithout agreement or concert with the other, a proposal has been made\r\nto the British Government to regulate this commerce by treaty, as it has\r\nbeen to arrange in like manner the just claim of the citizens of the\r\nUnited States inhabiting the States and Territories bordering on the\r\nlakes and rivers which empty into the St. Lawrence to the navigation of\r\nthat river to the ocean. For these and other objects of high importance\r\nto the interests of both parties a negotiation has been opened with the\r\nBritish Government which it is hoped will have a satisfactory result.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners under the sixth and seventh articles of the treaty of\r\nGhent having successfully closed their labors in relation to the sixth,\r\nhave proceeded to the discharge of those relating to the seventh. Their\r\nprogress in the extensive survey required for the performance of their\r\nduties justifies the presumption that it will be completed in the\r\nensuing year.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation which had been long depending with the French Government\r\non several important subjects, and particularly for a just indemnity for\r\nlosses sustained in the late wars by the citizens of the United States\r\nunder unjustifiable seizures and confiscations of their property, has\r\nnot as yet had the desired effect. As this claim rests on the same\r\nprinciple with others which have been admitted by the French Government,\r\nit is not perceived on what just ground it can be rejected. A minister\r\nwill be immediately appointed to proceed to France and resume the\r\nnegotiation on this and other subjects which may arise between the two\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nAt the proposal of the Russian Imperial Government, made through the\r\nminister of the Emperor residing here, a full power and instructions\r\nhave been transmitted to the minister of the United States at St.\r\nPetersburg to arrange by amicable negotiation the respective rights and\r\ninterests of the two nations on the northwest coast of this continent.\r\nA similar proposal had been made by His Imperial Majesty to the\r\nGovernment of Great Britain, which has likewise been acceded to. The\r\nGovernment of the United States has been desirous by this friendly\r\nproceeding of manifesting the great value which they have invariably\r\nattached to the friendship of the Emperor and their solicitude to\r\ncultivate the best understanding with his Government. In the discussions\r\nto which this interest has given rise and in the arrangements by which\r\nthey may terminate the occasion has been judged proper for asserting,\r\nas a principle in which the rights and interests of the United States\r\nare involved, that the American continents, by the free and independent\r\ncondition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be\r\nconsidered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.\r\n\r\nSince the close of the last session of Congress the commissioners\r\nand arbitrators for ascertaining and determining the amount of\r\nindemnification which may be due to citizens of the United States\r\nunder the decision of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Russia,\r\nin conformity to the convention concluded at St. Petersburg on the 12th\r\nof July, 1822, have assembled in this city, and organized themselves\r\nas a board for the performance of the duties assigned to them by that\r\ntreaty. The commission constituted under the eleventh article of the\r\ntreaty of the 22d of February, 1819, between the United States and Spain\r\nis also in session here, and as the term of three years limited by the\r\ntreaty for the execution of the trust will expire before the period of\r\nthe next regular meeting of Congress, the attention of the Legislature\r\nwill be drawn to the measures which may be necessary to accomplish the\r\nobjects for which the commission was instituted.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives adopted\r\nat their last session, instructions have been given to all the ministers\r\nof the United States accredited to the powers of Europe and America to\r\npropose the proscription of the African slave trade by classing it under\r\nthe denomination, and inflicting on its perpetrators the punishment, of\r\npiracy. Should this proposal be acceded to, it is not doubted that this\r\nodious and criminal practice will be promptly and entirely suppressed.\r\nIt is earnestly hoped that it will be acceded to, from the firm belief\r\nthat it is the most effectual expedient that can be adopted for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the recent war between France and Spain it was\r\ndeclared by the French Government that it would grant no commissions\r\nto privateers, and that neither the commerce of Spain herself nor\r\nof neutral nations should be molested by the naval force of France,\r\nexcept in the breach of a lawful blockade. This declaration, which\r\nappears to have been faithfully carried into effect, concurring with\r\nprinciples proclaimed and cherished by the United States from the\r\nfirst establishment of their independence, suggested the hope that\r\nthe time had arrived when the proposal for adopting it as a permanent\r\nand invariable rule in all future maritime wars might meet the\r\nfavorable consideration of the great European powers. Instructions have\r\naccordingly been given to our ministers with France, Russia, and Great\r\nBritain to make those proposals to their respective Governments, and\r\nwhen the friends of humanity reflect on the essential amelioration to\r\nthe condition of the human race which would result from the abolition of\r\nprivate war on the sea and on the great facility by which it might be\r\naccomplished, requiring only the consent of a few sovereigns, an earnest\r\nhope is indulged that these overtures will meet with an attention\r\nanimated by the spirit in which they were made, and that they will\r\nultimately be successful.\r\n\r\nThe ministers who were appointed to the Republics of Colombia and Buenos\r\nAyres during the last session of Congress proceeded shortly afterwards\r\nto their destinations. Of their arrival there official intelligence has\r\nnot yet been received. The minister appointed to the Republic of Chile\r\nwill sail in a few days. An early appointment will also be made to\r\nMexico. A minister has been received from Colombia, and the other\r\nGovernments have been informed that ministers, or diplomatic agents of\r\ninferior grade, would be received from each, accordingly as they might\r\nprefer the one or the other.\r\n\r\nThe minister appointed to Spain proceeded soon after his appointment\r\nfor Cadiz, the residence of the Sovereign to whom he was accredited.\r\nIn approaching that port the frigate which conveyed him was warned off\r\nby the commander of the French squadron by which it was blockaded and\r\nnot permitted to enter, although apprised by the captain of the frigate\r\nof the public character of the person whom he had on board, the landing\r\nof whom was the sole object of his proposed entry. This act, being\r\nconsidered an infringement of the rights of ambassadors and of nations,\r\nwill form a just cause of complaint to the Government of France against\r\nthe officer by whom it was committed.\r\n\r\nThe actual condition of the public finances more than realizes the\r\nfavorable anticipations that were entertained of it at the opening of\r\nthe last session of Congress. On the 1st of January there was a balance\r\nin the Treasury of $4,237,427.55. From that time to the 30th September\r\nthe receipts amounted to upward of $16,100,000, and the expenditures to\r\n$11,400,000. During the fourth quarter of the year it is estimated that\r\nthe receipts will at least equal the expenditures, and that there will\r\nremain in the Treasury on the 1st day of January next a surplus of\r\nnearly $9,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1825, a large amount of the war debt and a part\r\nof the Revolutionary debt become redeemable. Additional portions of the\r\nformer will continue to become redeemable annually until the year 1835.\r\nIt is believed, however, that if the United States remain at peace the\r\nwhole of that debt may be redeemed by the ordinary revenue of those\r\nyears during that period under the provision of the act of March 3,\r\n1817, creating the sinking fund, and in that case the only part of the\r\ndebt that will remain after the year 1835 will be the $7,000,000 of\r\n5 per cent stock subscribed to the Bank of the United States, and the\r\n3 per cent Revolutionary debt, amounting to $13,296,099.06, both of\r\nwhich are redeemable at the pleasure of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe state of the Army in its organization and discipline has been\r\ngradually improving for several years, and has now attained a high\r\ndegree of perfection. The military disbursements have been regularly\r\nmade and the accounts regularly and promptly rendered for settlement.\r\nThe supplies of various descriptions have been of good quality,\r\nand regularly issued at all of the posts. A system of economy and\r\naccountability has been introduced into every branch of the service\r\nwhich admits of little additional improvement. This desirable state\r\nhas been attained by the act reorganizing the staff of the Army,\r\npassed on the 14th of April, 1818.\r\n\r\nThe moneys appropriated for fortifications have been regularly and\r\neconomically applied, and all the works advanced as rapidly as the\r\namount appropriated would admit. Three important works will be completed\r\nin the course of this year--that is, Fort Washington, Fort Delaware, and\r\nthe fort at the Rigolets, in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Engineers and the Topographical Corps have been in constant\r\nand active service in surveying the coast and projecting the works\r\nnecessary for its defense.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy has attained a degree of perfection in its\r\ndiscipline and instruction equal, as is believed, to any institution\r\nof its kind in any country.\r\n\r\nThe money appropriated for the use of the Ordnance Department has been\r\nregularly and economically applied. The fabrication of arms at the\r\nnational armories and by contract with the Department has been gradually\r\nimproving in quality and cheapness. It is believed that their quality\r\nis now such as to admit of but little improvement.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the fortifications renders it necessary that there\r\nshould be a suitable appropriation for the purpose of fabricating the\r\ncannon and carriages necessary for those works.\r\n\r\nUnder the appropriation of $5,000 for exploring the Western waters\r\nfor the location of a site for a Western armory, a commission was\r\nconstituted, consisting of Colonel McRee, Colonel Lee, and Captain\r\nTalcott, who have been engaged in exploring the country. They have not\r\nyet reported the result of their labors, but it is believed that they\r\nwill be prepared to do it at an early part of the session of Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of June last General Ashley and his party, who were\r\ntrading under a license from the Government, were attacked by the\r\nRicarees while peaceably trading with the Indians at their request.\r\nSeveral of the party were killed and wounded and their property taken\r\nor destroyed.\r\n\r\nColonel Leavenworth, who commanded Fort Atkinson, at the Council Bluffs,\r\nthe most western post, apprehending that the hostile spirit of the\r\nRicarees would extend to other tribes in that quarter, and that thereby\r\nthe lives of the traders on the Missouri and the peace of the frontier\r\nwould be endangered, took immediate measures to check the evil.\r\n\r\nWith a detachment of the regiment stationed at the Bluffs he\r\nsuccessfully attacked the Ricaree village, and it is hoped that such\r\nan impression has been made on them as well as on the other tribes on\r\nthe Missouri as will prevent a recurrence of future hostility.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War, which is herewith transmitted, will\r\nexhibit in greater detail the condition of the Department in its various\r\nbranches, and the progress which has been made in its administration\r\nduring the three first quarters of the year.\r\n\r\nI transmit a return of the militia of the several States according to\r\nthe last reports which have been made by the proper officers in each to\r\nthe Department of War. By reference to this return it will be seen that\r\nit is not complete, although great exertions have been made to make it\r\nso. As the defense and even the liberties of the country must depend in\r\ntimes of imminent danger on the militia, it is of the highest importance\r\nthat it be well organized, armed, and disciplined throughout the Union.\r\nThe report of the Secretary of War shews the progress made during the\r\nthree first quarters of the present year by the application of the\r\nfund appropriated for arming the militia. Much difficulty is found in\r\ndistributing the arms according to the act of Congress providing for\r\nit from the failure of the proper departments in many of the States to\r\nmake regular returns. The act of May 12, 1820, provides that the system\r\nof tactics and regulations of the various corps of the Regular Army\r\nshall be extended to the militia. This act has been very imperfectly\r\nexecuted from the want of uniformity in the organization of the militia,\r\nproceeding from the defects of the system itself, and especially in its\r\napplication to that main arm of the public defense. It is thought that\r\nthis important subject in all its branches merits the attention of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Navy, which is now communicated,\r\nfurnishes an account of the administration of that Department for the\r\nthree first quarters of the present year, with the progress made in\r\naugmenting the Navy, and the manner in which the vessels in commission\r\nhave been employed.\r\n\r\nThe usual force has been maintained in the Mediterranean Sea, the\r\nPacific Ocean, and along the Atlantic coast, and has afforded the\r\nnecessary protection to our commerce in those seas.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico our naval force has been\r\naugmented by the addition of several small vessels provided for by\r\nthe \"act authorizing an additional naval force for the suppression of\r\npiracy,\" passed by Congress at their last session. That armament has\r\nbeen eminently successful in the accomplishment of its object. The\r\npiracies by which our commerce in the neighborhood of the island of\r\nCuba had been afflicted have been repressed and the confidence of\r\nour merchants in a great measure restored.\r\n\r\nThe patriotic zeal and enterprise of Commodore Porter, to whom the\r\ncommand of the expedition was confided, has been fully seconded by\r\nthe officers and men under his command. And in reflecting with high\r\nsatisfaction on the honorable manner in which they have sustained the\r\nreputation of their country and its Navy, the sentiment is alloyed\r\nonly by a concern that in the fulfillment of that arduous service the\r\ndiseases incident to the season and to the climate in which it was\r\ndischarged have deprived the nation of many useful lives, and among\r\nthem of several officers of great promise.\r\n\r\nIn the month of August a very malignant fever made its appearance\r\nat Thompsons Island, which threatened the destruction of our station\r\nthere. Many perished, and the commanding officer was severely attacked.\r\nUncertain as to his fate and knowing that most of the medical officers\r\nhad been rendered incapable of discharging their duties, it was thought\r\nexpedient to send to that post an officer of rank and experience, with\r\nseveral skillful surgeons, to ascertain the origin of the fever and the\r\nprobability of its recurrence there in future seasons; to furnish every\r\nassistance to those who were suffering, and, if practicable, to avoid\r\nthe necessity of abandoning so important a station. Commodore Rodgers,\r\nwith a promptitude which did him honor, cheerfully accepted that trust,\r\nand has discharged it in the manner anticipated from his skill and\r\npatriotism. Before his arrival Commodore Porter, with the greater\r\npart of the squadron, had removed from the island and returned to the\r\nUnited States in consequence of the prevailing sickness. Much useful\r\ninformation has, however, been obtained as to the state of the island\r\nand great relief afforded to those who had been necessarily left there.\r\n\r\nAlthough our expedition, cooperating with an invigorated administration\r\nof the government of the island of Cuba, and with the corresponding\r\nactive exertions of a British naval force in the same seas, have almost\r\nentirely destroyed the unlicensed piracies from that island, the success\r\nof our exertions has not been equally effectual to suppress the same\r\ncrime, under other pretenses and colors, in the neighboring island\r\nof Porto Rico. They have been committed there under the abusive\r\nissue of Spanish commissions. At an early period of the present year\r\nremonstrances were made to the governor of that island, by an agent\r\nwho was sent for the purpose, against those outrages on the peaceful\r\ncommerce of the United States, of which many had occurred. That officer,\r\nprofessing his own want of authority to make satisfaction for our just\r\ncomplaints, answered only by a reference of them to the Government of\r\nSpain. The minister of the United States to that court was specially\r\ninstructed to urge the necessity of the immediate and effectual\r\ninterposition of that Government, directing restitution and indemnity\r\nfor wrongs already committed and interdicting the repetition of them.\r\nThe minister, as has been seen, was debarred access to the Spanish\r\nGovernment, and in the meantime several new cases of flagrant outrage\r\nhave occurred, and citizens of the United States in the island of Porto\r\nRico have suffered, and others been threatened with assassination for\r\nasserting their unquestionable rights even before the lawful tribunals\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nThe usual orders have been given to all our public ships to seize\r\nAmerican vessels engaged in the slave trade and bring them in for\r\nadjudication, and I have the gratification to state that not one so\r\nemployed has been discovered, and there is good reason to believe\r\nthat our flag is now seldom, if at all, disgraced by that traffic.\r\nIt is a source of great satisfaction that we are always enabled to\r\nrecur to the conduct of our Navy with pride and commendation. As a\r\nmeans of national defense it enjoys the public confidence, and is\r\nsteadily assuming additional importance. It is submitted whether a more\r\nefficient and equally economical organization of it might not in several\r\nrespects be effected. It is supposed that higher grades than now exist\r\nby law would be useful. They would afford well-merited rewards to those\r\nwho have long and faithfully served their country, present the best\r\nincentives to good conduct, and the best means of insuring a proper\r\ndiscipline; destroy the inequality in that respect between military and\r\nnaval services, and relieve our officers from many inconveniences and\r\nmortifications which occur when our vessels meet those of other nations,\r\nours being the only service in which such grades do not exist.\r\n\r\nA report of the Postmaster-General, which accompanies this\r\ncommunication, will shew the present state of the Post-Office Department\r\nand its general operations for some years past.\r\n\r\nThere is established by law 88,600 miles of post-roads, on which the\r\nmail is now transported 85,700 miles, and contracts have been made\r\nfor its transportation on all the established routes, with one or two\r\nexceptions. There are 5,240 post-offices in the Union, and as many\r\npostmasters. The gross amount of postage which accrued from the 1st\r\nJuly, 1822, to the 1st July, 1823, was $1,114,345.12. During the\r\nsame period the expenditures of the Post-Office Department amounted\r\nto $1,169,885.51, and consisted of the following items, viz:\r\nCompensation to postmasters, $353,995.98; incidental expenses,\r\n$30,866.37; transportation of the mail, $784,600.08; payments into\r\nthe Treasury, $423.08. On the 1st of July last there was due to the\r\nDepartment from postmasters $135,245.28; from _late_ postmasters and\r\ncontractors, $256,749.31; making a total amount of balances due to the\r\nDepartment of $391,994.59. These balances embrace all delinquencies\r\nof postmasters and contractors which have taken place since the\r\norganization of the Department. There was due by the Department\r\nto contractors on the 1st of July last $26,548.64.\r\n\r\nThe transportation of the mail within five years past has been greatly\r\nextended, and the expenditures of the Department proportionably\r\nincreased. Although the postage which has accrued within the last three\r\nyears has fallen short of the expenditures $262,821.46, it appears that\r\ncollections have been made from the outstanding balances to meet the\r\nprincipal part of the current demands.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that not more than $250,000 of the above balances can\r\nbe collected, and that a considerable part of this sum can only be\r\nrealized by a resort to legal process. Some improvement in the receipts\r\nfor postage is expected. A prompt attention to the collection of moneys\r\nreceived by postmasters, it is believed, will enable the Department\r\nto continue its operations without aid from the Treasury, unless the\r\nexpenditures shall be increased by the establishment of new mail routes.\r\n\r\nA revision of some parts of the post-office law may be necessary;\r\nand it is submitted whether it would not be proper to provide for the\r\nappointment of postmasters, where the compensation exceeds a certain\r\namount, by nomination to the Senate, as other officers of the General\r\nGovernment are appointed.\r\n\r\nHaving communicated my views to Congress at the commencement of the\r\nlast session respecting the encouragement which ought to be given to our\r\nmanufactures and the principle on which it should be founded, I have\r\nonly to add that those views remain unchanged, and that the present\r\nstate of those countries with which we have the most immediate political\r\nrelations and greatest commercial intercourse tends to confirm them.\r\nUnder this impression I recommend a review of the tariff for the purpose\r\nof affording such additional protection to those articles which we are\r\nprepared to manufacture, or which are more immediately connected with\r\nthe defense and independence of the country.\r\n\r\nThe actual state of the public accounts furnishes additional evidence\r\nof the efficiency of the present system of accountability in relation\r\nto the public expenditure. Of the moneys drawn from the Treasury since\r\nthe 4th March, 1817, the sum remaining unaccounted for on the 30th of\r\nSeptember last is more than a million and a half of dollars less than on\r\nthe 30th of September preceding; and during the same period a reduction\r\nof nearly a million of dollars has been made in the amount of the\r\nunsettled accounts for moneys advanced previously to the 4th of March,\r\n1817. It will be obvious that in proportion as the mass of accounts of\r\nthe latter description is diminished by settlement the difficulty of\r\nsettling the residue is increased from the consideration that in many\r\ninstances it can be obtained only by legal process. For more precise\r\ndetails on this subject I refer to a report from the First Comptroller\r\nof the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe sum which was appropriated at the last session for the repairs of\r\nthe Cumberland road has been applied with good effect to that object.\r\nA final report has not yet been received from the agent who was\r\nappointed to superintend it. As soon as it is received it shall be\r\ncommunicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nMany patriotic and enlightened citizens who have made the subject an\r\nobject of particular investigation have suggested an improvement of\r\nstill greater importance. They are of opinion that the waters of the\r\nChesapeake and Ohio may be connected together by one continued canal,\r\nand at an expense far short of the value and importance of the object\r\nto be obtained. If this could be accomplished it is impossible to\r\ncalculate the beneficial consequences which would result from it.\r\nA great portion of the produce of the very fertile country through\r\nwhich it would pass would find a market through that channel. Troops\r\nmight be moved with great facility in war, with cannon and every kind\r\nof munition, and in either direction. Connecting the Atlantic with the\r\nWestern country in a line passing through the seat of the National\r\nGovernment, it would contribute essentially to strengthen the bond of\r\nunion itself. Believing as I do that Congress possess the right to\r\nappropriate money for such a national object (the jurisdiction remaining\r\nto the States through which the canal would pass), I submit it to your\r\nconsideration whether it may not be advisable to authorize by an\r\nadequate appropriation the employment of a suitable number of the\r\nofficers of the Corps of Engineers to examine the unexplored ground\r\nduring the next season and to report their opinion thereon. It will\r\nlikewise be proper to extend their examination to the several routes\r\nthrough which the waters of the Ohio may be connected by canals with\r\nthose of Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nAs the Cumberland road will require annual repairs, and Congress have\r\nnot thought it expedient to recommend to the States an amendment to the\r\nConstitution for the purpose of vesting in the United States a power to\r\nadopt and execute a system of internal improvement, it is also submitted\r\nto your consideration whether it may not be expedient to authorize the\r\nExecutive to enter into an arrangement with the several States through\r\nwhich the road passes to establish tolls, each within its limits, for\r\nthe purpose of defraying the expense of future repairs and of providing\r\nalso by suitable penalties for its protection against future injuries.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of the 7th of May, 1822, appropriated the sum of\r\n$22,700 for the purpose of erecting two piers as a shelter for vessels\r\nfrom ice near Cape Henlopen, Delaware Bay. To effect the object of the\r\nact the officers of the Board of Engineers, with Commodore Bainbridge,\r\nwere directed to prepare plans and estimates of piers sufficient to\r\nanswer the purpose intended by the act. It appears by their report,\r\nwhich accompanies the documents from the War Department, that the\r\nappropriation is not adequate to the purpose intended; and as the piers\r\nwould be of great service both to the navigation of the Delaware Bay and\r\nthe protection of vessels on the adjacent parts of the coast, I submit\r\nfor the consideration of Congress whether additional and sufficient\r\nappropriation should not be made.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Engineers were also directed to examine and survey the\r\nentrance of the harbor of the port of Presquille, in Pennsylvania, in\r\norder to make an estimate of the expense of removing the obstructions\r\nto the entrance, with a plan of the best mode of effecting the same,\r\nunder the appropriation for that purpose by act of Congress passed 3d\r\nof March last. The report of the Board accompanies the papers from the\r\nWar Department, and is submitted for the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nA strong hope has been long entertained, founded on the heroic struggle\r\nof the Greeks, that they would succeed in their contest and resume their\r\nequal station among the nations of the earth. It is believed that the\r\nwhole civilized world take a deep interest in their welfare. Although\r\nno power has declared in their favor, yet none, according to our\r\ninformation, has taken part against them. Their cause and their\r\nname have protected them from dangers which might ere this have\r\noverwhelmed any other people. The ordinary calculations of interest and\r\nof acquisition with a view to aggrandizement, which mingles so much in\r\nthe transactions of nations, seem to have had no effect in regard to\r\nthem. From the facts which have come to our knowledge there is good\r\ncause to believe that their enemy has lost forever all dominion over\r\nthem; that Greece will become again an independent nation. That she\r\nmay obtain that rank is the object of our most ardent wishes.\r\n\r\nIt was stated at the commencement of the last session that a great\r\neffort was then making in Spain and Portugal to improve the condition of\r\nthe people of those countries, and that it appeared to be conducted with\r\nextraordinary moderation. It need scarcely be remarked that the result\r\nhas been so far very different from what was then anticipated. Of events\r\nin that quarter of the globe, with which we have so much intercourse\r\nand from which we derive our origin, we have always been anxious and\r\ninterested spectators. The citizens of the United States cherish\r\nsentiments the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness\r\nof their fellow-men on that side of the Atlantic. In the wars of the\r\nEuropean powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken\r\nany part, nor does it comport with our policy so to do. It is only when\r\nour rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or\r\nmake preparation for our defense. With the movements in this hemisphere\r\nwe are of necessity more immediately connected, and by causes which must\r\nbe obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers. The political\r\nsystem of the allied powers is essentially different in this respect\r\nfrom that of America. This difference proceeds from that which exists\r\nin their respective Governments; and to the defense of our own, which\r\nhas been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure, and matured\r\nby the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens, and under which we\r\nhave enjoyed unexampled felicity, this whole nation is devoted. We owe\r\nit, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing between\r\nthe United States and those powers to declare that we should consider\r\nany attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this\r\nhemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. With the existing\r\ncolonies or dependencies of any European power we have not interfered\r\nand shall not interfere. But with the Governments who have declared\r\ntheir independence and maintained it, and whose independence we have,\r\non great consideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could\r\nnot view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or\r\ncontrolling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power\r\nin any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly\r\ndisposition toward the United States. In the war between those new\r\nGovernments and Spain we declared our neutrality at the time of their\r\nrecognition, and to this we have adhered, and shall continue to adhere,\r\nprovided no change shall occur which, in the judgment of the competent\r\nauthorities of this Government, shall make a corresponding change on\r\nthe part of the United States indispensable to their security.\r\n\r\nThe late events in Spain and Portugal shew that Europe is still\r\nunsettled. Of this important fact no stronger proof can be adduced than\r\nthat the allied powers should have thought it proper, on any principle\r\nsatisfactory to themselves, to have interposed by force in the internal\r\nconcerns of Spain. To what extent such interposition may be carried, on\r\nthe same principle, is a question in which all independent powers whose\r\ngovernments differ from theirs are interested, even those most remote,\r\nand surely none more so than the United States. Our policy in regard\r\nto Europe, which was adopted at an early stage of the wars which have\r\nso long agitated that quarter of the globe, nevertheless remains the\r\nsame, which is, not to interfere in the internal concerns of any of\r\nits powers; to consider the government _de facto_ as the legitimate\r\ngovernment for us; to cultivate friendly relations with it, and to\r\npreserve those relations by a frank, firm, and manly policy, meeting\r\nin all instances the just claims of every power, submitting to injuries\r\nfrom none. But in regard to those continents circumstances are eminently\r\nand conspicuously different. It is impossible that the allied powers\r\nshould extend their political system to any portion of either continent\r\nwithout endangering our peace and happiness; nor can anyone believe that\r\nour southern brethren, if left to themselves, would adopt it of their\r\nown accord. It is equally impossible, therefore, that we should behold\r\nsuch interposition in any form with indifference. If we look to the\r\ncomparative strength and resources of Spain and those new Governments,\r\nand their distance from each other, it must be obvious that she can\r\nnever subdue them. It is still the true policy of the United States\r\nto leave the parties to themselves, in the hope that other powers will\r\npursue the same course.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the present condition of our Union with its actual state\r\nat the close of our Revolution, the history of the world furnishes no\r\nexample of a progress in improvement in all the important circumstances\r\nwhich constitute the happiness of a nation which bears any resemblance\r\nto it. At the first epoch our population did not exceed 3,000,000.\r\nBy the last census it amounted to about 10,000,000, and, what is more\r\nextraordinary, it is almost altogether native, for the immigration\r\nfrom other countries has been inconsiderable At the first epoch half\r\nthe territory within our acknowledged limits was uninhabited and a\r\nwilderness. Since then new territory has been acquired of vast extent,\r\ncomprising within it many rivers, particularly the Mississippi, the\r\nnavigation of which to the ocean was of the highest importance to the\r\noriginal States. Over this territory our population has expanded in\r\nevery direction, and new States have been established almost equal in\r\nnumber to those which formed the first bond of our Union. This expansion\r\nof our population and accession of new States to our Union have had the\r\nhappiest effect on all its highest interests. That it has eminently\r\naugmented our resources and added to our strength and respectability\r\nas a power is admitted by all. But it is not in these important\r\ncircumstances only that this happy effect is felt. It is manifest that\r\nby enlarging the basis of our system and increasing the number of\r\nStates the system itself has been greatly strengthened in both its\r\nbranches. Consolidation and disunion have thereby been rendered equally\r\nimpracticable. Each Government, confiding in its own strength, has less\r\nto apprehend from the other, and in consequence each, enjoying a greater\r\nfreedom of action, is rendered more efficient for all the purposes\r\nfor which it was instituted. It is unnecessary to treat here of the\r\nvast improvement made in the system itself by the adoption of this\r\nConstitution and of its happy effect in elevating the character and in\r\nprotecting the rights of the nation as well as of individuals. To what,\r\nthen, do we owe these blessings? It is known to all that we derive them\r\nfrom the excellence of our institutions. Ought we not, then, to adopt\r\nevery measure which may be necessary to perpetuate them?\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _December 7, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBy an act of the last session of Congress it was made the duty of\r\nthe accounting officers of the Treasury to adjust and settle the\r\naccounts of Daniel D. Tompkins, late governor of the State of New\r\nYork, on principles of equity and justice, subject to the revision and\r\nfinal decision of the President of the United States. The accounting\r\nofficers have, in compliance with this act, reported to me a balance of\r\n$35,190 in favor of Governor Tompkins, which report I have had under\r\nconsideration, together with his claim to an additional allowance,\r\nand should have decided on the same before the present time had I not\r\ndelayed my decision at his request. From the view which I have taken\r\nof the subject I am satisfied, considering all the circumstances of\r\nthe case, that a larger sum ought to be allowed him than that reported\r\nby the accounting officers of the Treasury. No appropriation, however,\r\nhaving been made by the act, and it appearing by recent information from\r\nhim that the sum reported would afford him an essential accommodation\r\nat this time, the subject is submitted to the consideration of Congress\r\nwith a view to that object.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its advice and consent as to the\r\nratification, a treaty lately concluded with the Seminole Indians in\r\nFlorida, whereby a cession of territory is made to the United States.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 15, 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 23, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to Congress a statement by William Lambert,\r\nexplanatory of his astronomical calculations with a view to establish\r\nthe longitude of the Capitol.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 31, 1823_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, with accompanying documents, containing the information\r\nrequested by the resolution of the House of the 19th instant, relating\r\nto the condition and future prospects of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n18th of December last, requesting copies of contracts for cannon, cannon\r\nshot, muskets, and other small arms which have been entered into since\r\nthe 1st of January, 1820, and for other detailed information therein\r\nspecified, I herewith transmit a report, with accompanying documents,\r\nfrom the Department of War,\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 9, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 18th\r\nof December, 1823, requesting copies of all contracts for cannon,\r\ncannon shot, muskets, and other small arms entered into since the\r\n1st of January, 1820, I herewith transmit a report from the Department\r\nof the Navy, with other documents relating thereto.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 12, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives of December\r\n24, requesting the President of the United States to lay before the\r\nHouse such information as he may possess, and which may be disclosed\r\nwithout injury to the public good, relative to the determination of\r\nany sovereign, or combination of sovereigns, to assist Spain in the\r\nsubjugation of her late colonies on the American continent, and whether\r\nany Government of Europe is disposed or determined to oppose any aid or\r\nassistance which such sovereign or combination of sovereigns may afford\r\nto Spain for the subjugation of her late colonies above mentioned,\r\nI have to state that I possess no information on that subject not known\r\nto Congress which can be disclosed without injury to the public good.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 30, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n15th of December last, requesting the President of the United States \"to\r\ncommunicate a plan for a peace establishment of the Navy of the United\r\nStates,\" I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nwhich contains the plan required.\r\n\r\nIn presenting this plan to the consideration of Congress, I avail myself\r\nof the occasion to make some remarks on it which the importance of the\r\nsubject requires and experience justifies.\r\n\r\nIf a system of universal and permanent peace could be established, or\r\nif in war the belligerent parties would respect the rights of neutral\r\npowers, we should have no occasion for a navy or an army. The expense\r\nand dangers of such establishments might be avoided. The history of all\r\nages proves that this can not be presumed; on the contrary, that at\r\nleast one-half of every century, in ancient as well as modern times,\r\nhas been consumed in wars, and often of the most general and desolating\r\ncharacter. Nor is there any cause to infer, if we examine the condition\r\nof the nations with which we have the most intercourse and strongest\r\npolitical relations, that we shall in future be exempt from that\r\ncalamity within any period to which a rational calculation may be\r\nextended. And as to the rights of neutral powers, it is sufficient to\r\nappeal to our own experience to demonstrate how little regard will be\r\npaid to them whenever they come in conflict with the interests of the\r\npowers at war while we rely on the justice of our cause and on argument\r\nalone. The amount of the property of our fellow-citizens which was\r\nseized and confiscated or destroyed by the belligerent parties in the\r\nwars of the French Revolution, and of those which followed before we\r\nbecame a party to the war, is almost incalculable.\r\n\r\nThe whole movement of our Government from the establishment of our\r\nindependence has been guided by a sacred regard for peace. Situated as\r\nwe are in the new hemisphere, distant from Europe and unconnected with\r\nits affairs, blessed with the happiest Government on earth, and having\r\nno objects of ambition to gratify, the United States have steadily\r\ncultivated the relations of amity with every power; and if in any\r\nEuropean wars a respect for our rights might be relied on, it was\r\nundoubtedly in those to which I have adverted. The conflict being vital,\r\nthe force being nearly equally balanced, and the result uncertain, each\r\nparty had the strongest motives of interest to cultivate our good will,\r\nlest we might be thrown into the opposite scale. Powerful as this\r\nconsideration usually is, it was nevertheless utterly disregarded\r\nin almost every stage of and by every party to those wars. To these\r\nencroachments and injuries our regard for peace was finally forced\r\nto yield.\r\n\r\nIn the war to which at length we became a party our whole coast from St.\r\nCroix to the Mississippi was either invaded or menaced with invasion,\r\nand in many parts with a strong imposing force both land and naval.\r\nIn those parts where the population was most dense the pressure was\r\ncomparatively light, but there was scarcely an harbor or city on any\r\nof our great inlets which could be considered secure. New York and\r\nPhiladelphia were eminently exposed, the then existing works not being\r\nsufficient for their protection. The same remark is applicable in a\r\ncertain extent to the cities eastward of the former, and as to the\r\ncondition of the whole country southward of the latter the events which\r\nmark the war are too recent to require detail. Our armies and Navy\r\nsignalized themselves in every quarter where they had occasion to meet\r\ntheir gallant foe, and the militia voluntarily flew to their aid with\r\na patriotism and fought with a bravery which exalted the reputation of\r\ntheir Government and country and which did them the highest honor. In\r\nwhatever direction the enemy chose to move with their squadrons and to\r\nland their troops our fortifications, where any existed, presented but\r\nlittle obstacle to them. They passed those works without difficulty.\r\nTheir squadrons, in fact, annoyed our whole coast, not of the sea only,\r\nbut every bay and great river throughout its whole extent. In entering\r\nthose inlets and sailing up them with a small force the effect was\r\ndisastrous, since it never failed to draw out the whole population on\r\neach side and to keep it in the field while the squadron remained there.\r\nThe expense attending this species of defense, with the exposure of\r\nthe inhabitants and the waste of property, may readily be conceived.\r\n\r\nThe occurrences which preceded the war and those which attended it were\r\nalike replete with useful instruction as to our future policy. Those\r\nwhich marked the first epoch demonstrate clearly that in the wars of\r\nother powers we can rely only on force for the protection of our neutral\r\nrights. Those of the second demonstrate with equal certainty that in any\r\nwar in which we may be engaged hereafter with a strong naval power the\r\nexpense, waste, and other calamities attending it, considering the vast\r\nextent of our maritime frontier, can not fail, unless it be defended\r\nby adequate fortifications and a suitable naval force, to correspond\r\nwith those which were experienced in the late war. Two great objects\r\nare therefore to be regarded in the establishment of an adequate naval\r\nforce: The first, to prevent war so far as it may be practicable; the\r\nsecond, to diminish its calamities when it may be inevitable. Hence the\r\nsubject of defense becomes intimately connected in all its parts in war\r\nand in peace, for the land and at sea. No government will be disposed in\r\nits wars with other powers to violate our rights if it knows we have the\r\nmeans, are prepared and resolved to defend them. The motive will also be\r\ndiminished if it knows that our defenses by land are so well planned and\r\nexecuted that an invasion of our coast can not be productive of the\r\nevils to which we have heretofore been exposed.\r\n\r\nIt was under a thorough conviction of these truths, derived from the\r\nadmonitions of the late war, that Congress, as early as the year 1816,\r\nduring the term of my enlightened and virtuous predecessor, under whom\r\nthe war had been declared, prosecuted, and terminated, digested and made\r\nprovision for the defense of our country and support of its rights,\r\nin peace as well as in war, by acts which authorized and enjoined the\r\naugmentation of our Navy to a prescribed limit, and the construction\r\nof suitable fortifications throughout the whole extent of our maritime\r\nfrontier and wherever else they might be deemed necessary. It is to the\r\nexecution of these works, both land and naval, and under a thorough\r\nconviction that by hastening their completion I should render the best\r\nservice to my country and give the most effectual support to our free\r\nrepublican system of government that my humble faculties would admit of,\r\nthat I have devoted so much of my time and labor to this great system of\r\nnational policy since I came into this office, and shall continue to do\r\nit until my retirement from it at the end of your next session.\r\n\r\nThe Navy is the arm from which our Government will always derive most\r\naid in support of our neutral rights. Every power engaged in war will\r\nknow the strength of our naval force, the number of our ships of each\r\nclass, their condition, and the promptitude with which we may bring them\r\ninto service, and will pay due consideration to that argument. Justice\r\nwill always have great weight in the cabinets of Europe; but in long and\r\ndestructive wars exigencies often occur which press so vitally on them\r\nthat unless the argument of force is brought to its aid it will be\r\ndisregarded. Our land forces will always perform their duty in the event\r\nof war, but they must perform it on the land. Our Navy is the arm which\r\nmust be principally relied on for the annoyance of the commerce of the\r\nenemy and for the protection of our own, and also, by cooperation with\r\nthe land forces, for the defense of the country. Capable of moving in\r\nany and every direction, it possesses the faculty, even when remote from\r\nour coast, of extending its aid to every interest on which the security\r\nand welfare of our Union depend. Annoying the commerce of the enemy and\r\nmenacing in turn its coast, provided the force on each side is nearly\r\nequally balanced, it will draw its squadrons from our own; and in case\r\nof invasion by a powerful adversary by a land and naval force, which is\r\nalways to be anticipated and ought to be provided against, our Navy may,\r\nby like cooperation with our land forces, render essential aid in\r\nprotecting our interior from incursion and depredation.\r\n\r\nThe great object in the event of war is to stop the enemy at the coast.\r\nIf this is done our cities and whole interior will be secure. For the\r\naccomplishment of this object our fortifications must be principally\r\nrelied on. By placing strong works near the mouths of our great inlets\r\nin such positions as to command the entrances into them, as may be done\r\nin many instances, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for ships\r\nto pass them, especially if other precautions, and particularly that of\r\nsteam batteries, are resorted to in their aid. In the wars between other\r\npowers into which we may be drawn in support of our neutral rights it\r\ncan not be doubted that this defense would be adequate to the purpose\r\nintended by it, nor can it be doubted that the knowledge that such works\r\nexisted would form a strong motive with any power not to invade our\r\nrights, and thereby contribute essentially to prevent war. There are,\r\nit is admitted, some entrances into our interior which are of such\r\nvast extent that it would be utterly impossible for any works, however\r\nextensive or well posted, to command them. Of this class the Chesapeake\r\nBay, which is an arm of the sea, may be given as an example. But, in my\r\njudgment, even this bay may be defended against any power with whom we\r\nmay be involved in war as a third party in the defense of our neutral\r\nrights. By erecting strong works at the mouth of James River, on both\r\nsides, near the capes, as we are now doing, and at Old Point Comfort and\r\nthe Rip Raps, and connecting those works together by chains whenever the\r\nenemy's force appeared, placing in the rear some large ships and steam\r\nbatteries, the passage up the river would be rendered impracticable.\r\nThis guard would also tend to protect the whole country bordering on the\r\nbay and rivers emptying into it, as the hazard would be too great for\r\nthe enemy, however strong his naval force, to ascend the bay and leave\r\nsuch a naval force behind; since, in the event of a storm, whereby his\r\nvessels might be separated, or of a calm, the ships and steam batteries\r\nbehind the works might rush forth and destroy them. It could only be in\r\nthe event of an invasion by a great power or a combination of several\r\npowers, and by land as well as by naval forces, that those works could\r\nbe carried; and even then they could not fail to retard the movement of\r\nthe enemy into the country and to give time for the collection of our\r\nregular troops, militia, and volunteers to that point, and thereby\r\ncontribute essentially to his ultimate defeat and expulsion from our\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nUnder a strong impression that a peace establishment of our Navy is\r\nconnected with the possible event of war, and that the naval force\r\nintended for either state, however small it may be, is connected with\r\nthe general system of public defense, I have thought it proper in\r\ncommunicating this report to submit these remarks on the whole subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 2, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n11th of December last, requesting the President of the United States to\r\ncommunicate to the House all such parts of the correspondence with the\r\nGovernment of Spain relating to the Florida treaty to the period of its\r\nfinal ratification, not heretofore communicated, which, in his opinion,\r\nit might not be inconsistent with the public interest to communicate,\r\nI herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of State, with copies\r\nof the correspondence requested.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives on the 12th instant having \"resolved that\r\nthe President of the United States be requested to inform this House\r\nwhether the rules and regulations compiled by General Scott for the\r\ngovernment of the Army are now in force in the Army, or any part\r\nthereof, and by what authority the same has been adopted and enforced,\"\r\nI herewith transmit a report from the Department of War, which contains\r\nthe information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 11th\r\ninstant, requesting the President of the United States \"to inform this\r\nHouse if the line intended to constitute the western boundary of the\r\nTerritory of Arkansas has been run in conformity with the provisions\r\nof the third section of the act of Congress of the 3d of March, 1823,\r\nentitled 'An act making appropriation for the military service of the\r\nUnited States for the year 1823, and for other purposes,' and, if said\r\nline has not been run, that he inform this House what instructions have\r\nbeen given or measures adopted in relation to the execution of the\r\nprovision of the law, and what causes have prevented said line from\r\nbeing run,\" I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of War,\r\nwhich contains the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives on the 26th ultimo having \"resolved that\r\nthe President of the United States be requested to cause to be laid\r\nbefore the House an estimate of the expense which would be incurred by\r\ntransporting 200 of the troops now at the Council Bluffs to the mouth\r\nof the Columbia or Oregon River,\" I herewith transmit a report of the\r\nSecretary of War, which contains the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to Congress certain documents relating to a claim\r\nof Massachusetts for services rendered by the militia of that State\r\nin the late war, and for which payment was made by the State. From the\r\nparticular circumstances attending this claim I have thought it proper\r\nto submit the subject to the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn forming a just estimate of this claim it will be necessary to recur\r\nto the cause which prevented its admission, or the admission of any part\r\nthereof, at an earlier day. It will be recollected that when a call was\r\nmade on the militia of that State for service in the late war, under\r\nan arrangement which was alike applicable to the militia of all the\r\nStates and in conformity with the acts of Congress, the executive of\r\nMassachusetts refused to comply with the call, on the principle that\r\nthe power vested in Congress by the Constitution to provide for\r\ncalling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress\r\ninsurrections, and repel invasions was not a complete power for\r\nthose purposes, but conditional, and dependent on the consent of the\r\nexecutives of the several States, and, also, that when called into\r\nservice, such consent being given, they could not be commanded by a\r\nregular officer of the United States, or other officer than of the\r\nmilitia, except by the President in person. That this decision of\r\nthe executive of Massachusetts was repugnant to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, and of dangerous tendency, especially when it is\r\nconsidered that we were then engaged in a war with a powerful nation\r\nfor the defense of our common rights, was the decided opinion of this\r\nGovernment; and when the period at which that decision was formed was\r\nconsidered, it being as early as the 5th of August, 1812, immediately\r\nafter the war was declared, and that it was not relinquished during the\r\nwar, it was inferred by the Executive of the United States that the\r\ndecision of the executive of that State was alike applicable to all the\r\nservices that were rendered by the militia of the State during the war.\r\n\r\nIn the correspondence with the governor of Massachusetts at that\r\nimportant epoch, and on that very interesting subject, it was announced\r\nto him by the Secretary of War that if the militia of the State were\r\ncalled into service by the executive of the State, and not put under the\r\ncommand of the Major-General of the United States, as the militia of\r\nthe other States were, the expense attending their service would be\r\nchargeable to the State, and not to the United States. It was also\r\nstated to him at the same time that any claim which the State might\r\nhave for the reimbursement of such expenses could not be allowed by the\r\nExecutive of the United States, since it would involve principles on\r\nwhich that branch of the Government could not decide.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances a decision on the claim of the State of\r\nMassachusetts has hitherto been suspended, and it need not be remarked\r\nthat the suspension has proceeded from a conviction that it would be\r\nimproper to give any sanction by its admission, or by the admission\r\nof any part thereof, either to the construction of the Constitution\r\ncontended for by the then executive of that State or to its conduct\r\nat that period toward the General Government and the Union.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1823, the Representatives in Congress from Massachusetts and\r\nMaine suggested, by memorial, that the constitutional objection could\r\nnot apply to a portion of the claim, and requested that the accounting\r\nofficer of the Government might be instructed to audit and admit such\r\npart as might be free from that objection. In all cases where claims\r\nare presented for militia service it is the duty and the practice of\r\nthe accounting officer to submit them to the Department for instruction\r\nas to the legality of the claim; that is, whether the service had been\r\nrendered by order of the competent authority, or otherwise, under\r\ncircumstances to justify the claim against the United States, admitting\r\nthat the evidence in support of it should be satisfactory. To this\r\nrequest there appeared to be no well-founded objection, under the\r\nreservation as to the constitutional principle, and accordingly an order\r\nwas given to the accounting officers of the Treasury to proceed in\r\nauditing the claim with that reservation.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this arrangement, the executive of Massachusetts\r\nappointed two citizens of that State commissioners to attend to the\r\nsettlement of its claim, and who, in execution of the trust reposed in\r\nthem, have presented to the accounting officer of the Treasury that\r\nportion comprehending the services of the fifth division of the militia\r\nof the State, which has been audited and reported for consideration,\r\nsubject to the objection above stated. I have examined this report, with\r\nthe documents presented by the commissioners, and am of opinion that\r\nthe services rendered by that division were spontaneous, patriotic, and\r\nproper, necessary for self-defense, to repel in some instances actual\r\ninvasion and in others to meet by adequate preparation invasions that\r\nwere menaced. The commissioners of the State having intimated that other\r\nportions of service stood on similar ground, the accounting officer has\r\nbeen instructed, in auditing the whole, to do it in such manner as to\r\nenable the Department to show distinctly under what circumstances each\r\nportion of service was rendered, whether voluntary, called out by\r\ninvasion or the menace of invasion, or by public authority, and in such\r\ncase whether the militia rendering such service was placed under the\r\nauthority of the United States or retained under that of the State.\r\n\r\nIt affords me great pleasure to state that the present executive of\r\nMassachusetts has disclaimed the principle which was maintained by the\r\nformer executive, and that in this disclaimer both branches of the\r\nlegislature have concurred. By this renunciation the State is placed on\r\nthe same ground in this respect with the other States, and this very\r\ndistressing anomaly in our system is removed. It is well known that the\r\ngreat body of our fellow-citizens in Massachusetts are as firmly devoted\r\nto our Union and to the free republican principles of our Government as\r\nour fellow-citizens of the other States. Of this important truth their\r\nconduct in every stage of our Revolutionary struggle and in many other\r\nemergencies bears ample testimony; and I add with profound interest and\r\na thorough conviction that, although the difficulty adverted to in the\r\nlate war with their executive excited equal surprise and regret, it\r\nwas not believed to extend to them. There never was a moment when the\r\nconfidence of the Government in the great body of our fellow-citizens\r\nof that State was impaired, nor is a doubt entertained that they were\r\nat all times willing and ready to support their rights and repel an\r\ninvasion by the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners of Massachusetts have urged, in compliance with their\r\ninstructions, the payment of so much of their claim as applies to the\r\nservices rendered by the fifth division, which have been audited, and\r\nI should have no hesitation in admitting it if I did not think, under\r\nall the circumstances of the case, that the claim in all its parts was\r\ncognizable by Congress alone. The period at which the constitutional\r\ndifficulty was raised by the executive of the State was in the highest\r\ndegree important, as was the tendency of the principle for which it\r\ncontended, and which was adhered to during the war. The public mind\r\nthroughout the Union was much excited by that occurrence, and great\r\nsolicitude was felt as to its consequences. The Executive of the United\r\nStates was bound to maintain, and did maintain, a just construction of\r\nthe Constitution, in doing which it is gratifying to recollect that the\r\nmost friendly feelings were cherished toward their brethren of that\r\nState. The executive of the State was warned, in the correspondence\r\nwhich then took place, of the light in which its conduct was viewed\r\nand of the effect it would have, so far as related to the right of the\r\nExecutive of the United States, on any claim which might afterwards be\r\npresented by the State to compensation for such services. Under these\r\ncircumstances the power of the Executive of the United States to settle\r\nany portion of this claim seems to be precluded. It seems proper, also,\r\nthat this claim should be decided on full investigation before the\r\npublic, that the principle on which it is decided may be thoroughly\r\nunderstood by our fellow-citizens of every State, which can be done by\r\nCongress alone, who alone, also, possess the power to pass laws which\r\nmay be necessary to carry such decision into effect.\r\n\r\nIn submitting this subject to the calm and enlightened judgment of\r\nCongress, I do it with peculiar satisfaction, from a knowledge that you\r\nare now placed, by the course of events, in a situation which will\r\nenable you to adopt such measures as will not only comport with the\r\nsound principles of our Government, but likewise be conducive to other\r\nthe highest interests of our Union. By the renunciation of the principle\r\nmaintained by the then executive of Massachusetts, as has been done by\r\nits present executive and both branches of the legislature in the most\r\nformal manner and in accord with the sentiments of the great body of the\r\npeople, the Constitution is restored in a very important feature (that\r\nconnected with the public defense) and in the most important branch\r\n(that of the militia) to its native strength. It is very gratifying to\r\nknow that this renunciation has been produced by the regular, orderly,\r\nand pacific operation of our republican system, whereby those who\r\nwere in the right at the moment of difficulty and who sustained the\r\nGovernment with great firmness have daily gained strength until this\r\nresult was accomplished. The points on which you will have to decide\r\nare, What is fairly due for the services which were actually rendered?\r\nBy what means shall we contribute most to cement the Union and give the\r\ngreatest support to our most excellent Constitution? In seeking each\r\nobject separately we are led to the same result. All that can be claimed\r\nby our fellow-citizens of Massachusetts is that the constitutional\r\nobjection be waived, and that they be placed on the same footing with\r\ntheir brethren in the other States; that regarding the services rendered\r\nby the militia of other States, for which compensation has been made,\r\ngiving to the rule the most liberal construction, like compensation be\r\nmade for similar services rendered by the militia of that State.\r\n\r\nI have been led to conclude on great consideration that the principles\r\nof justice as well as a due regard for the great interests of our Union\r\nrequire that this claim in the extent proposed should be acceded to.\r\nEssential service was rendered in the late war by the militia of\r\nMassachusetts, and with the most patriotic motives. It seems just,\r\ntherefore, that they should be compensated for such services in like\r\nmanner with the militia of the other States. The constitutional\r\ndifficulty did not originate with them, and has now been removed. It\r\ncomports with our system to look to the service rendered and to the\r\nintention with which it was rendered, and to award the compensation\r\naccordingly, especially as it may now be done without the sacrifice of\r\nprinciple. The motive in this instance is the stronger because well\r\nsatisfied I am that by so doing we shall give the most effectual support\r\nto our republican institutions. No latent cause of discontent will be\r\nleft behind. The great body of the people will be gratified, and even\r\nthose who now survive who were then in error can not fail to see with\r\ninterest and satisfaction this distressing occurrence thus happily\r\nterminated. I therefore consider it my duty to recommend it to Congress\r\nto make provision for the settlement of the claim of Massachusetts\r\nfor services rendered in the late war by the militia of the State,\r\nin conformity with the rules which have governed in the settlement of\r\nthe claims for services rendered by the militia of the other States.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 24, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of War, containing the\r\ninformation called for by a resolution of the House of Representatives\r\nof the United States, passed on the 4th instant, respecting any suit or\r\nsuits which have been or are now depending, in which the United States\r\nare interested, for the recovery of the Pea Patch.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 25, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n17th instant, I now transmit the report of the Secretary of the Navy,\r\naccompanied by statements marked A and B, shewing \"the amount of money\r\nexpended in conformity with the provisions of the act entitled 'An act\r\nfor the gradual increase of the Navy of the United States,' approved\r\nApril 29, 1816, and of the act to amend said act, approved 3d of March,\r\n1821; also the number of vessels built or now on the stocks, with their\r\nrates, the value of the timber purchased, or for which contracts\r\nhave been made, and whether sufficient timber has been purchased or\r\ncontracted for to build the vessels contemplated by the provisions of\r\nsaid acts.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 3, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report of the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\ncontaining copies of the contracts made by the Surveyor-General,\r\nand called for by a resolution of the Senate bearing date the 24th\r\nFebruary, 1824.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which communicates\r\nall the information in possession of the Department called for by a\r\nresolution of the House requesting a copy of the report of the register\r\nof the land office in the eastern district of Louisiana, bearing date\r\nthe 6th of January, 1821, together with all the information from the\r\nsaid register to the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 4, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n1st March, 1823, requesting information of the number and position of\r\nthe permanent fortifications which have been and are now erecting for\r\nthe defense of the coasts, harbors, and frontiers of the United States,\r\nwith the classification and magnitude of each, with the amount expended\r\non each, showing the work done and to be done, the number of guns of\r\nevery caliber for each fortification, the total cost of a complete\r\narmament for each, the force required to garrison each in time of peace\r\nand of war, I transmit to the House a report from the Secretary of War\r\ncontaining the information required by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 8, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the 3d March, 1819, James Miller was first commissioned as governor\r\nof the Territory of Arkansas for the term of three years from that date.\r\n\r\nBefore the expiration of that time, and in the winter of 1821-22, a\r\nnomination of him for reappointment was intended, and believed by me\r\nto have been made to the Senate, and to have received the confirmation\r\nof that body.\r\n\r\nBy some accident, the cause of which is unknown, it appears that this\r\nimpression was erroneous, and in December, 1822, it was discovered that\r\nMr. Miller had not then been recommissioned, though in the confidence\r\nthat he had been he had continued to act in that capacity. He was then\r\nrenominated to the Senate, with the additional proposal that his\r\ncommission should take effect from 3d March, 1822, when his first\r\ncommission had expired.\r\n\r\nThe nomination was confirmed by the Senate so far as regarded the\r\nappointment, but without concurrence in the retrospective effect\r\nproposed to be given to the commission.\r\n\r\nHis second commission, therefore, bears date on the 3d January, 1823,\r\nand the interposition of the Legislature becomes necessary to legalize\r\nhis official acts in the interval between 3d March, 1822, and that time,\r\na subject which I recommend to the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 17, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n17th of February last, requesting \"information whether any measures had\r\nbeen taken for carrying into effect the resolution of Congress of June\r\n17, 1777, directing a monument to be erected to the memory of David\r\nWooster, a brigadier-general in the Army of the United States, who fell\r\nin defending the liberties of America and bravely repelling an inroad\r\nof the British forces to Danbury, in Connecticut,\" I have caused the\r\nnecessary inquiries to be made, and find by the report of the Register\r\nof the Treasury that no monument has been erected to the memory of that\r\npatriotic and gallant officer, nor has any money been paid to the\r\nexecutive of Connecticut on that account.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 25, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 25th of February, requesting information whether the title of the\r\nUnited Brethren for Propagating the Gospel among the Heathen to certain\r\nsections of land in Ohio has been purchased for the United States, and,\r\nif so, to cause a copy of the contract and of the papers relating\r\nthereto to be laid before the House, I transmit herewith all the\r\ndocuments required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 25, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving seen with regret that occasional errors have been made in\r\nnominations to the Senate, sometimes by the omission of a letter in\r\nthe name, proceeding from casualties in the Departments and in my own\r\noffice, it would be satisfactory to me if an arrangement could be made\r\nwhereby such errors might be corrected without the formality of a\r\nspecial message. Where there is an accord as to the person there seems\r\nto be no reason for resorting to a renomination for the correction of\r\nsuch trivial errors. Any mode which the Senate may adopt will be\r\nsatisfactory to me.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 25, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving stated to Congress on the 7th of December last that Daniel D.\r\nTompkins, late governor of New York, was entitled to a larger sum than\r\nthat reported in his favor by the accounting officers of the Government,\r\nand that in the execution of the law of the last session I had the\r\nsubject still under consideration, I now communicate to you the result.\r\n\r\nOn full consideration of the law by which this duty was enjoined on me\r\nand of the report of the committee on the basis of which the law was\r\nfounded, I have thought that I was authorized to adopt the principles\r\nlaid down in that report in deciding on the sum which should be allowed\r\nto him for his services. With this view and on a comparison of his\r\nservices with those which were rendered by other disbursing officers,\r\ntaking into consideration also his aid in obtaining loans, I had decided\r\nto allow him 5 per cent for all sums borrowed and disbursed by him, and\r\nof which decision I informed him. Mr. Tompkins has since stated to me\r\nthat this allowance will not indemnify him for his advances, loans,\r\nexpenditures, and losses in rendering those services, nor place him\r\non the footing of those who loaned money to the Government at that\r\ninteresting period. He has also expressed a desire that I would submit\r\nthe subject to the final decision of Congress, which I now do. In\r\nadopting this measure I think proper to add that I concur fully in the\r\nsentiments expressed by the committee in favor of the very patriotic and\r\nvaluable services which were rendered by Mr. Tompkins in the late war.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 28, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a report of the Secretary of War, together with a\r\nreport from the Commissioner of the General Land Office, accompanied\r\nby the necessary documents, communicating the information heretofore\r\nrequested by a resolution of the House in relation to the salt springs,\r\nlead and copper mines, together with the probable value of each of them\r\nand of the reservations attached to each, the extent to which they have\r\nbeen worked, the advantages and proximity of each to navigable waters,\r\nand the origin, nature, and extent of any claim made to them by\r\nindividuals or companies, which reports contain all the information\r\nat present possessed on the subjects of the said resolution.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH 30, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n14th instant, requesting information whether an advance of compensation\r\nhad been made to any of the commissioners who had been appointed for\r\nthe examination of titles and claims to land in Florida, and by what\r\nauthority such advance, if any, had been made, I transmit a report of\r\nthe Secretary of State, which contains the information desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 30, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress certain papers enumerated in a report from the\r\nSecretary of War, relating to the compact between the United States and\r\nthe State of Georgia entered into in 1802, whereby the latter ceded to\r\nthe former a portion of the territory then within its limits on the\r\nconditions therein specified. By the fourth article of that compact\r\nit was stipulated that the United States should at their own expense\r\nextinguish for the use of Georgia the Indian title to all the lands\r\nwithin the State as soon as it might be done _peaceably_ and on\r\n_reasonable_ conditions. These papers show the measures adopted by the\r\nExecutive of the United States in fulfillment of the several conditions\r\nof the compact from its date to the present time, and particularly the\r\nnegotiations and treaties with the Indian tribes for the extinguishment\r\nof their title, with an estimate of the number of acres purchased and\r\nsums paid for lands they acquired. They show also the state in which\r\nthis interesting concern now rests with the Cherokees, one of the tribes\r\nwithin the State, and the inability of the Executive to make any further\r\nmovement with this tribe without the special sanction of Congress.\r\n\r\nI have full confidence that my predecessors exerted their best endeavors\r\nto execute this compact in all its parts, of which, indeed, the sums\r\npaid and the lands acquired during their respective terms in fulfillment\r\nof its several stipulations are a full proof. I have also been animated\r\nsince I came into this office with the same zeal, from an anxious\r\ndesire to meet the wishes of the State, and in the hope that by the\r\nestablishment of these tribes beyond the Mississippi their improvement\r\nin civilization, their security and happiness would be promoted. By the\r\npaper bearing date on the 30th of January last, which was communicated\r\nto the chiefs of the Cherokee Nation in this city, who came to protest\r\nagainst any further appropriations of money for holding treaties with\r\nthem, the obligation imposed on the United States by the compact with\r\nGeorgia to extinguish the Indian title to the right of soil within the\r\nState, and the incompatibility with our system of their existence as\r\na distinct community within any State, were pressed with the utmost\r\nearnestness. It was proposed to them at the same time to procure and\r\nconvey to them territory beyond the Mississippi in exchange for that\r\nwhich they hold within the limits of Georgia, or to pay them for it its\r\nvalue in money. To this proposal their answer, which bears date 11th of\r\nFebruary following, gives an unqualified refusal. By this it is manifest\r\nthat at the present time and in their present temper they can be removed\r\nonly by force, to which, should it be deemed proper, the power of the\r\nExecutive is incompetent.\r\n\r\nI have no hesitation, however, to declare it as my opinion that the\r\nIndian title was not affected in the slightest circumstance by the\r\ncompact with Georgia, and that there is no obligation on the United\r\nStates to remove the Indians by force. The express stipulation of the\r\ncompact that their title should be extinguished at the expense of the\r\nUnited States when it may be done _peaceably_ and on _reasonable_\r\nconditions is a full proof that it was the clear and distinct\r\nunderstanding of both parties to it that the Indians had a right to\r\nthe territory, in the disposal of which they were to be regarded as\r\nfree agents. An attempt to remove them by force would, in my opinion,\r\nbe unjust. In the future measures to be adopted in regard to the Indians\r\nwithin our limits, and, in consequence, within the limits of any State,\r\nthe United States have duties to perform and a character to sustain\r\nto which they ought not to be indifferent. At an early period their\r\nimprovement in the arts of civilized life was made an object with the\r\nGovernment, and that has since been persevered in. This policy was\r\ndictated by motives of humanity to the aborigines of the country, and\r\nunder a firm conviction that the right to adopt and pursue it was\r\nequally applicable to all the tribes within our limits.\r\n\r\nMy impression is equally strong that it would promote essentially the\r\nsecurity and happiness of the tribes within our limits if they could be\r\nprevailed on to retire west and north of our States and Territories on\r\nlands to be procured for them by the United States, in exchange for\r\nthose on which they now reside. Surrounded as they are, and pressed\r\nas they will be, on every side by the white population, it will be\r\ndifficult if not impossible for them, with their kind of government, to\r\nsustain order among them. Their interior will be exposed to frequent\r\ndisturbances, to remedy which the interposition of the United States\r\nwill be indispensable, and thus their government will gradually lose its\r\nauthority until it is annihilated. In this process the moral character\r\nof the tribes will also be lost, since the change will be too rapid to\r\nadmit their improvement in civilization to enable them to institute and\r\nsustain a government founded on our principles, if such a change were\r\ncompatible either with the compact with Georgia or with our general\r\nsystem, or to become members of a State, should any State be willing\r\nto adopt them in such numbers, regarding the good order, peace, and\r\ntranquillity of such State. But all these evils may be avoided if these\r\ntribes will consent to remove beyond the limits of our present States\r\nand Territories. Lands equally good, and perhaps more fertile, may be\r\nprocured for them in those quarters. The relations between the United\r\nStates and such Indians would still be the same.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of humanity and benevolence, which have now great weight,\r\nwould operate in that event with an augmented force, since we should\r\nfeel sensibly the obligation imposed on us by the accommodation which\r\nthey thereby afforded us. Placed at ease, as the United States would\r\nthen be, the improvement of those tribes in civilization and in all\r\nthe arts and usages of civilized life would become the part of a general\r\nsystem which might be adopted on great consideration, and in which every\r\nportion of our Union would then take an equal interest. These views have\r\nsteadily been pursued by the Executive, and the moneys which have\r\nbeen placed at its disposal have been so applied in the manner best\r\ncalculated, according to its judgment, to produce this desirable result,\r\nas will appear by the documents which accompany the report of the\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nI submit this subject to the consideration of Congress under a high\r\nsense of its importance and of the propriety of an early decision on it.\r\nThis compact gives a claim to the State which ought to be executed in\r\nall its conditions with perfect good faith. In doing this, however, it\r\nis the duty of the United States to regard its strict import, and to\r\nmake no sacrifice of their interest not called for by the compact nor\r\ncontemplated by either of the parties when it was entered into, nor\r\nto commit any breach of right or of humanity in regard to the Indians\r\nrepugnant to the judgment and revolting to the feelings of the whole\r\nAmerican people. I submit the subject to your consideration, in full\r\nconfidence that you will duly weigh the obligations of the compact with\r\nGeorgia, its import in all its parts, and the extent to which the United\r\nStates are bound to go under it. I submit it with equal confidence that\r\nyou will also weigh the nature of the Indian title to the territory\r\nwithin the limits of any State, with the stipulations in the several\r\ntreaties with this tribe respecting territory held by it within the\r\nState of Georgia, and decide whether any measure on the part of Congress\r\nis called for at the present time, and what such measure shall be if any\r\nis deemed expedient.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 9, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit the report of the Secretary of War, with the\r\naccompanying documents, containing the information requested by a\r\nresolution of the House of the 10th ultimo, and which communicates\r\nthe accounts of all the generals of the Army, likewise of the\r\nInspector-General, the chiefs of the Engineer and Ordnance Corps, and\r\nSurgeon-General for the two years preceding the 30th of September last;\r\nalso shewing the amount of money paid to each under the different heads\r\nof pay, fuel, straw, quarters, transportation, and all other extra and\r\ncontingent allowances; which report, together with the statements\r\nherewith transmitted, furnishes all the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe executive of Virginia having requested payment of the amount of\r\ninterest paid by the State for moneys borrowed and paid by it for\r\nservices rendered by the militia in the late war, and such claim not\r\nbeing allowable according to the uniform decisions of the accounting\r\nofficers of the Government, I submit the subject to your consideration,\r\nwith a report from the Secretary of War and all the documents connected\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe following are the circumstances on which this claim is founded:\r\nFrom an early stage of the war the squadrons of the enemy entered\r\noccasionally the Chesapeake Bay, and, menacing its shores and those of\r\nthe principal rivers emptying into it, subjected the neighboring militia\r\nto calls from the local authorities for the defense of the parts thus\r\nmenaced. The pressure was most sensibly felt in 1814, after the attack\r\non this city and its capture, when the invading force, retiring to its\r\nsquadron, menaced alike Baltimore, Norfolk, and Richmond. The attack\r\non this city had induced a call by the Department of War for large\r\ndetachments of the militia of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia,\r\nwhich, being collected in this quarter, and the enemy bearing, in the\r\nfirst instance, on Baltimore, were ordered to its defense. As early\r\nas the 31st of August notice was given by the Secretary of War to the\r\ngovernor of Virginia of the position of the enemy and of the danger to\r\nwhich Richmond as well as Norfolk and Baltimore were exposed, and he was\r\nalso authorized and enjoined to be on his guard, prepared at every point\r\nand in every circumstance to meet and repel the invaders. This notice\r\nwas repeated several times afterwards, until the enemy left the bay and\r\nmoved to the south.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the war the State had augmented its taxes to meet the\r\npressure, but the funds being still inadequate, it borrowed money to a\r\nconsiderable amount, which was applied to the payment of the militia for\r\nthe services thus rendered. The calls which had been made, except for\r\nthe brigades in this quarter and at Norfolk, being made by the State,\r\nthe settlement with those corps and the payment for their services were\r\nmade according to the rules and usage of the Department by the State\r\nand not by the United States. On the settlement by the State, after the\r\npeace, with the accounting officers of the Government the reimbursement\r\nof the interest which the State had paid on the sums thus borrowed and\r\npaid to the militia was claimed, but not allowed for the reason above\r\nstated. It is this claim which I now submit to the consideration of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be remarked that where a State advances money for the\r\nuse of the General Government for a purpose authorized by it that the\r\nclaim for the interest on the amount thus advanced, which has been paid\r\nby the State, is reasonable and just. The claim is the stronger under\r\nthe circumstance which existed when those advances were made, it being\r\nat a period of great difficulty, when the United States were compelled\r\nto borrow very large sums for the prosecution of the war. Had the State\r\nnot borrowed this money the militia, whose services have been recognized\r\nsince by the nation, must have been disbanded and the State left without\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\nThe claim is, in my opinion, equally well founded where a State advances\r\nmoney which it has in its treasury, or which it raises by taxes, to meet\r\nthe current demand.\r\n\r\nIn submitting this claim to your consideration it is proper to observe\r\nthat many other States have like claims with those of Virginia, and that\r\nall those similarly circumstanced should be placed on the same footing.\r\n\r\nI invite your attention to a principle which is deemed just, and with a\r\nview that the provision which may be made respecting it may be extended\r\nalike to all the States.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 12, 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 16, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n8th of April, requesting information whether the fifth section of the\r\nact of the 3d March, 1803, relating to a township of land lying within\r\nJohn Cleves Symmes's patent, had been executed, and, if not, what\r\nreasons had prevented it, I transmit a report from the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, which affords the information desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 16, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report of the Secretary of\r\nWar, containing the information requested by a resolution of the House\r\ndated 25th ultimo, shewing the reason why the engineers appointed to\r\nexamine the most suitable site for a national armory on the Western\r\nwaters have not made their report.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 16, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a report from\r\nthe Secretary of War, which contains the information requested by a\r\nresolution of the 8th instant, respecting the proposals that were made\r\nby certain Indians, therein described, of the Cherokee Nation for the\r\ncession of their lands to the United States.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 18, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n13th instant, requesting a detailed account of the disbursement of the\r\nsums appropriated by the acts of the 30th April, 1818, and of the 3d\r\nMarch, 1819, for making certain improvements in the grounds connected\r\nwith the public offices and the President's house, I transmit a report\r\nfrom the Commissioner of the Public Buildings, which contains the\r\ninformation desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 23, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity with a resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nyesterday, I have received a copy of the proceedings of the committee to\r\nwhom was referred a communication from Ninian Edwards, lately appointed\r\na minister plenipotentiary to Mexico, in which it is decided that\r\nhis attendance in this city for the purpose of being examined by the\r\ncommittee on matters contained in the said communication was requisite.\r\nAs soon as I was apprised that such a communication had been made to the\r\nHouse, anticipating that the attendance of Mr. Edwards might be desired\r\nfor the purpose stated, I thought it proper that he should be informed\r\nthereof, and instructed him not to proceed on his mission, but to await\r\nsuch call as might be made on him either by the House or its committee,\r\nand in consequence a letter was addressed to him to that effect by the\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 27, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the resolution of the Senate of the 19th instant,\r\nrequesting information whether the Executive, through the agency of\r\nthe War Department, borrowed any money during the late war, under the\r\ncondition of applying the same to the defense of the State wherein the\r\nsaid loans were made, to what amount, and whether interest was paid by\r\nthe United States for such loans, etc., I herewith transmit a report\r\nfrom the Secretary of War containing all the information in that\r\nDepartment in relation to the resolution.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL, 28, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives having referred back the accounts and\r\nclaims of Daniel D. Tompkins, late governor of New York, to be settled\r\non the principles established by the report of the committee and the law\r\nfounded on it in the last session I have reconsidered the subject, and\r\nnow communicate the result.\r\n\r\nBy the report of the committee, which it was understood was adopted by\r\nthe House, it was decided that his accounts and claims should be settled\r\non the four following principles:\r\n\r\nFirst. That interest should be allowed him on all moneys advanced by\r\nhim for the public from the time of the advance to that of his being\r\nreimbursed.\r\n\r\nSecond. That a reasonable commission should be allowed him on all moneys\r\ndisbursed by him during the late war.\r\n\r\nThird. That an indemnity should be allowed for all losses which he had\r\nsustained by the failure of the Government to fulfill its engagements\r\nto send him money or Treasury notes within the time specified to be\r\ndeposited in certain banks as collateral security for loans procured\r\nby him at the request and on account of the Government.\r\n\r\nFourth. That he should not be held responsible for losses incurred by\r\nthe frauds and failures of subagents to whom moneys were advanced\r\nthrough his hands.\r\n\r\nOn the first, that of interest on his advances for the public, I have\r\nallowed him $14,438.68. This allowance is made on advances admitted by\r\nthe accounting department, and on the declaration of Mr. Tompkins that\r\nthe remittances made to him, after his advances and previous to the\r\n24th of December, 1814, when a very large sum was remitted to him, were\r\napplied to public purposes and not to the reimbursement of his advances.\r\n\r\nOn the second head, that of a reasonable commission for his\r\ndisbursements during the late war, I have allowed him 5 per cent on\r\nthe whole sum disbursed by him, amounting to $92,213.13. I have made\r\nhim this extra allowance in consideration of the aid which he afforded\r\nto the Government at that important epoch in obtaining the loan of a\r\nconsiderable part of the sums thus disbursed.\r\n\r\nOn the third head, that of an indemnity for losses sustained by him in\r\nconsequence of the failure of the Government to fulfill its engagements\r\nto send him money or Treasury notes within the time specified, I have\r\nallowed him $4,411.25, being the amount of the loss sustained on the\r\nsale of Treasury notes, for which he was responsible.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth head, that of losses sustained by him by any frauds or\r\nfailures of subagents, none such having been shewn no allowance whatever\r\nhas been made to him.\r\n\r\nFrom the amount thus allowed to Mr. Tompkins after deducting the sum\r\npaid him under the act of the present session and the moneys charged\r\nto his account there will remain a balance due him of $60,238.46, as\r\nappears by the sketch herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nIn making a final decision on Mr. Tompkins's claims a question arises,\r\nShall interest be allowed him on the amount of the commission on his\r\ndisbursements? The law of the last session grants to the President\r\na power to allow interest on moneys advanced by him to the public,\r\nbut does not authorize it on the commission to be allowed on his\r\ndisbursements. To make such allowance belongs exclusively to Congress.\r\nHad his claims been settled at the end of the last war on the principles\r\nestablished by the law of the last session a commission on disbursements\r\nwould then have been allowed him. This consideration operates with great\r\nforce in favor of the allowance of interest on that commission at this\r\ntime, which I recommend to Congress.\r\n\r\nI think proper to add that the official relation which I bore to\r\nGovernor Tompkins at that very interesting epoch, under the highly\r\ndistinguished and meritorious citizen under whom we both served,\r\nenabling me to feel very sensibly the value of his services, excites a\r\nstrong interest in his favor, which I deem it not improper to express.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 30, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for their constitutional advice with regard\r\nto its ratification, a convention for the suppression of the African\r\nslave trade, signed at London on the 13th ultimo by the minister of the\r\nUnited States residing there on their part, with the plenipotentiaries\r\nof the British Government on the part of that nation, together with\r\nthe correspondence relating thereto, a part of which is included in a\r\ncommunication made to the House of Representatives on the 19th ultimo,\r\na printed copy of which is among the documents herewith sent.\r\n\r\nMotives of accommodation to the wishes of the British Government\r\nrender it desirable that the Senate should act definitively upon\r\nthis convention as speedily as may be found convenient.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 30, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the Senate a treaty entered into with the Cherokee\r\nNation as early as 1804, but which, owing to causes not now understood,\r\nhas never been carried into effect. Of the authenticity of the\r\ntransaction a report from the Secretary of War, with the documents\r\naccompanying it, furnishes the most unquestionable proof. I submit it\r\nto the Senate for its advice and consent as to the ratification.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 7, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith to the Senate a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, with the documents relating to the present state of the\r\ncommercial intercourse between the United States and Portugal,\r\nrequested by the resolution of the Senate of the 13th ultimo.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY 11, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a report of\r\nthe Secretary of War, containing the information called for by the\r\nresolution of the 10th of March, requesting the names of all the\r\nofficers of the Army who have been brevetted, stating their lineal rank\r\nand brevet rank, when brevetted, and the amount of money paid to each\r\nand when paid, which report, with the accompanying documents, contains\r\nthe information desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY 13, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 15th of April, requesting the President to cause to be communicated\r\nto the House a statement of the supplies which have been sent from the\r\nUnited States to any ports of South America for the use of our squadron\r\nin the Pacific Ocean, of the amount paid for such supplies, with the\r\nnames of the owners of the vessels, and other details therein specified,\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of the Navy, which, with\r\nthe documents accompanying it, furnishes the information desired.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY 14, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a report of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, together with the proceedings of a court-martial\r\nlately held at Norfolk for the trial of Lieutenant Beverly Kennon, as\r\nrequested by a resolution of the House bearing date the 25th of April,\r\n1824.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 18, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate to the House a report, with accompanying documents,\r\nreceived from Alexander Hamilton, one of the commissioners of land\r\ntitles in East Florida, deeming the statements therein contained to be\r\nworthy of the particular attention of the House, and of a nature which\r\nmay, perhaps, require their interposition or that of both branches of\r\nthe Legislature.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 21, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nApprehending from the delay in the decision that some difficulty exists\r\nwith the Senate respecting the ratification of the convention lately\r\nconcluded with the British Government for the suppression of the slave\r\ntrade by making it piratical, I deem it proper to communicate for your\r\nconsideration such views as appear to me to merit attention. Charged\r\nas the Executive is, and as I have long been, with maintaining the\r\npolitical relations between the United States and other nations, I\r\nconsider it my duty, in submitting for your advice and consent as to\r\nthe ratification any treaty or convention which has been agreed on\r\nwith another power, to explain, when the occasion requires it, all\r\nthe reasons which induced the measure. It is by such full and frank\r\nexplanation only that the Senate can be enabled to discharge the high\r\ntrust reposed in them with advantage to their country. Having the\r\ninstrument before them, with the views which guided the Executive in\r\nforming it, the Senate will possess all the light necessary to a sound\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nBy an act of Congress of 15th May, 1820, the slave trade, as described\r\nby that act, was made piratical, and all such of our citizens as might\r\nbe found engaged in that trade were subjected, on conviction thereof\r\nby the circuit courts of the United States, to capital punishment. To\r\ncommunicate more distinctly the import of that act, I refer to its\r\nfourth and fifth sections, which are in the following words:\r\n\r\n  SEC. 4. _And be it further enacted_, That if any citizen of the United\r\n  States, being of the crew or ship's company of any foreign ship or\r\n  vessel engaged in the slave trade, or any person whatever, being of the\r\n  crew or ship's company of any ship or vessel owned in the whole or part\r\n  or navigated for or in behalf of any citizen or citizens of the United\r\n  States, shall land from any such ship or vessel, and on any foreign\r\n  shore seize any Negro or Mulatto not held to service or labor by the\r\n  laws of either of the States or Territories of the United States, with\r\n  intent to make such Negro or Mulatto a slave, or shall decoy or forcibly\r\n  bring or carry, or shall receive, such Negro or Mulatto on board any\r\n  such ship or vessel, with intent as aforesaid, such citizen or person\r\n  shall be adjudged a pirate, and on conviction thereof before the circuit\r\n  court of the United States for the district wherein he may be brought or\r\n  found shall suffer death.\r\n\r\n  SEC. 5. _And be it further enacted_, That if any citizen of the United\r\n  States, being of the crew or ship's company of any foreign ship or\r\n  vessel engaged in the slave trade, or any person whatever, being of the\r\n  crew or ship's company of any ship or vessel owned wholly or in part, or\r\n  navigated for or in behalf of, any citizen or citizens of the United\r\n  States, shall forcibly confine or detain, or aid and abet in forcibly\r\n  confining or detaining, on board such ship or vessel any Negro or\r\n  Mulatto not held to service by the laws of either of the States or\r\n  Territories of the United States, with intent to make such Negro or\r\n  Mulatto a slave, or shall on board any such ship or vessel offer or\r\n  attempt to sell as a slave any Negro or Mulatto not held to service as\r\n  aforesaid, or shall on the high seas or anywhere on tide water transfer\r\n  or deliver over to any other ship or vessel any Negro or Mulatto not\r\n  held to service as aforesaid, with intent to make such Negro or mulatto\r\n  a slave, or shall land or deliver on shore from on board any such ship\r\n  or vessel any such Negro or mulatto, with intent to make sale of, or\r\n  having previously sold such Negro or Mulatto as a slave, such citizen or\r\n  person shall be adjudged a pirate, and on conviction thereof before the\r\n  circuit court of the United States for the district wherein he may be\r\n  brought or found shall suffer death.\r\n\r\nAnd on the 28th February, 1823, the House of Representatives, by a\r\nmajority of 131 to 9, passed a resolution to the following effect:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the President of the United States be requested to\r\n  enter upon and prosecute from time to time such negotiations with the\r\n  several maritime powers of Europe and America as he may deem expedient\r\n  for the effectual abolition of the African slave trade and its ultimate\r\n  denunciation as piracy under the law of nations, by the consent of the\r\n  civilized world.\r\n\r\nBy the act of Congress above referred to, whereby the most effectual\r\nmeans that could be devised were adopted for the extirpation of the\r\nslave trade, the wish of the United States was explicitly declared, that\r\nall nations might concur in a similar policy. It could only be by such\r\nconcurrence that the great object could be accomplished, and it was by\r\nnegotiation and treaty alone that such concurrence could be obtained,\r\ncommencing with one power and extending it to others. The course,\r\ntherefore, which the Executive, who had concurred in the act, had to\r\npursue was distinctly marked out for it. Had there, however, been any\r\ndoubt respecting it, the resolution of the House of Representatives,\r\nthe branch which might with strict propriety express its opinion, could\r\nnot fail to have removed it.\r\n\r\nBy the tenth article of the treaty of peace between the United States\r\nand Great Britain, concluded at Ghent, it was stipulated that both\r\nparties should use their best endeavors to accomplish the abolition\r\nof the African slave trade. This object has been accordingly pursued\r\nby both Governments with great earnestness, by separate acts of\r\nlegislation, and by negotiation almost uninterrupted, with the purpose\r\nof establishing a conceit between them in some measure which might\r\nsecure its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain in her negotiations with other powers had concluded\r\ntreaties with Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, in which, without\r\nconstituting the crime as piracy or classing it with crimes of that\r\ndenomination, the parties had conceded to the naval officers of each\r\nother the right of search and capture of the vessels of either that\r\nmight be engaged in the slave trade, and had instituted courts\r\nconsisting of judges, subjects of both parties, for the trial of the\r\nvessels so captured.\r\n\r\nIn the negotiations with the United States Great Britain had earnestly\r\nand repeatedly pressed on them the adoption of similar provisions.\r\nThey had been resisted by the Executive on two grounds: One, that\r\nthe constitution of mixed tribunals was incompatible with their\r\nConstitution; and the other, that the concession of the right of search\r\nin time of peace for an offense not piratical would be repugnant to the\r\nfeelings of the nation and of dangerous tendency. The right of search is\r\nthe right of war of the belligerent toward the neutral. To extend it in\r\ntime of peace to any object whatever might establish a precedent which\r\nmight lead to others with some powers, and which, even if confined to\r\nthe instance specified, might be subject to great abuse.\r\n\r\nAnimated by an ardent desire to suppress this trade, the United States\r\ntook stronger ground by making it, by the act above referred to,\r\npiratical, a measure more adequate to the end and free from many of\r\nthe objections applicable to the plan which had been proposed to them.\r\nIt is this alternative which the Executive, under the sanction and\r\ninjunctions above stated, offered to the British Government, and which\r\nthat Government has accepted. By making the crime piracy the right of\r\nsearch attaches to the crime, and which when adopted by all nations will\r\nbe common to all; and that it will be so adopted may fairly be presumed\r\nif steadily persevered in by the parties to the present convention. In\r\nthe meantime, and with a view to a fair experiment, the obvious course\r\nseems to be to carry into effect with every power such treaty as may be\r\nmade with each in succession.\r\n\r\nIn presenting this alternative to the British Government it was made\r\nan indispensable condition that the trade should be made piratical\r\nby act of Parliament, as it had been by an act of Congress. This was\r\nprovided for in the convention, and has since been complied with. In\r\nthis respect, therefore, the nations rest on the same ground. Suitable\r\nprovisions have also been adopted to protect each party from the abuse\r\nof the power granted to the public ships of the other. Instead of\r\nsubjecting the persons detected in the slave trade to trial by the\r\ncourts of the captors, as would be the case if such trade was piracy by\r\nthe laws of nations, it is stipulated that until that event they shall\r\nbe tried by the courts of their own country only. Hence there could be\r\nno motive for an abuse of the right of search, since such abuse could\r\nnot fail to terminate to the injury of the captor.\r\n\r\nShould this convention be adopted, there is every reason to believe\r\nthat it will be the commencement of a system destined to accomplish the\r\nentire abolition of the slave trade. Great Britain, by making it her\r\nown, confessedly adopted at the suggestion of the United States, and\r\nbeing pledged to propose and urge its adoption by other nations in\r\nconcert with the United States, will find it for her interest to abandon\r\nthe less-effective system of her previous treaties with Spain, Portugal,\r\nand the Netherlands, and to urge on those and other powers their\r\naccession to this. The crime will then be universally proscribed as\r\npiracy, and the traffic be suppressed forever.\r\n\r\nOther considerations of high importance urge the adoption of this\r\nconvention. We have at this moment pending with Great Britain sundry\r\nother negotiations intimately connected with the welfare and even the\r\npeace of our Union. In one of them nearly a third part of the territory\r\nof the State of Maine is in contestation. In another the navigation of\r\nthe St. Lawrence, the admission of consuls into the British islands, and\r\na system of commercial intercourse between the United States and all the\r\nBritish possessions in this hemisphere are subjects of discussion. In a\r\nthird our territorial and other rights upon the northwest coast are to\r\nbe adjusted, while a negotiation on the same interest is opened with\r\nRussia. In a fourth all the most important controvertible points of\r\nmaritime law in time of war are brought under consideration, and in\r\nthe fifth the whole system of South American concerns, connected with\r\na general recognition of South American independence, may again from\r\nhour to hour become, as it has already been, an object of concerted\r\noperations of the highest interest to both nations and to the peace\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nIt can not be disguised that the rejection of this convention can not\r\nfail to have a very injurious influence on the good understanding\r\nbetween the two Governments on all these points. That it would place\r\nthe Executive Administration under embarrassment, and subject it, the\r\nCongress, and the nation to the charge of insincerity respecting the\r\ngreat result of the final suppression of the slave trade, and that\r\nits first and indispensable consequence will be to constrain the\r\nExecutive to suspend all further negotiation with every European and\r\nAmerican power to which overtures have been made in compliance with the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of 28th February, 1823, must\r\nbe obvious. To invite all nations, with the statute of piracy in our\r\nhands, to adopt its principles as the law of nations and yet to deny\r\nto all the common right of search for the pirate, whom it would be\r\nimpossible to detect without entering and searching the vessel, would\r\nexpose us not simply to the charge of inconsistency.\r\n\r\nIt must be obvious that the restriction of search for pirates to the\r\nAfrican coast is incompatible with the idea of such a crime. It is\r\nnot doubted also if the convention is adopted that no example of the\r\ncommission of that crime by the citizens or subjects of either power\r\nwill ever occur again. It is believed, therefore, that this right as\r\napplicable to piracy would not only extirpate the trade, but prove\r\naltogether innocent in its operation.\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of the views of Congress on this subject, I\r\ntransmit to the Senate extracts from two resolutions of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, one of the 9th February, 1821, the other of 12th April,\r\n1822. I transmit also a letter from the chargé d'affaires of the British\r\nGovernment, which shows the deep interest which that Government takes\r\nin the ratification of the treaty.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _May 22, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report of the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy, in compliance with their resolution of the 14th of April last,\r\nrespecting prize agents, which report contains the information\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY 24, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n13th instant, requesting the President to communicate any information\r\nhe may possess in relation to the intercourse and trade now carried on\r\nbetween the people of the United States (and particularly the people\r\nof the State of Missouri) and the Mexican Provinces, how and by what\r\nroute that trade or intercourse is carried on, in what it consists, the\r\ndistances, etc., the nations of Indians through which it passes, their\r\ndispositions, whether pacific or otherwise, the advantages resulting or\r\nlikely to result from that trade or intercourse, I herewith transmit\r\na communication from the Department of State, which contains all the\r\ninformation which has yet been collected in relation to those subjects.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY 24, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the 20th instant, I transmit\r\nherewith to the House of Representatives a report of David Shriver,\r\nsuperintendent of the Cumberland road, stating the manner in which the\r\nappropriation made at the last session for the repair of that road has\r\nbeen expended, and also the present condition of the road.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe view which I have now to present to you of our affairs, foreign and\r\ndomestic, realizes the most sanguine anticipations which have been\r\nentertained of the public prosperity. If we look to the whole, our\r\ngrowth as a nation continues to be rapid beyond example; if to the\r\nStates which compose it, the same gratifying spectacle is exhibited.\r\nOur expansion over the vast territory within our limits has been\r\ngreat, without indicating any decline in those sections from which the\r\nemigration has been most conspicuous. We have daily gained strength by\r\na native population in every quarter--a population devoted to our happy\r\nsystem of government and cherishing the bond of union with fraternal\r\naffection. Experience has already shewn that the difference of climate\r\nand of industry, proceeding from that cause, inseparable from such vast\r\ndomains, and which under other systems might have a repulsive tendency,\r\ncan not fail to produce with us under wise regulations the opposite\r\neffect. What one portion wants the other may supply; and this will be\r\nmost sensibly felt by the parts most distant from each other, forming\r\nthereby a domestic market and an active intercourse between the extremes\r\nand throughout every portion of our Union. Thus by a happy distribution\r\nof power between the National and State Governments, Governments which\r\nrest exclusively on the sovereignty of the people and are fully adequate\r\nto the great purposes for which they were respectively instituted,\r\ncauses which might otherwise lead to dismemberment operate powerfully\r\nto draw us closer together. In every other circumstance a correct view\r\nof the actual state of our Union must be equally gratifying to our\r\nconstituents. Our relations with foreign powers are of a friendly\r\ncharacter, although certain interesting differences remain unsettled\r\nwith some. Our revenue under the mild system of impost and tonnage\r\ncontinues to be adequate to all the purposes of the Government Our\r\nagriculture, commerce, manufactures, and navigation flourish. Our\r\nfortifications are advancing in the degree authorized by existing\r\nappropriations to maturity, and due progress is made in the augmentation\r\nof the Navy to the limit prescribed for it by law. For these blessings\r\nwe owe to Almighty God, from whom we derive them, and with profound\r\nreverence, our most grateful and unceasing acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nIn adverting to our relations with foreign powers, which are always\r\nan object of the highest importance, I have to remark that of the\r\nsubjects which have been brought into discussion with them during the\r\npresent Administration some have been satisfactorily terminated, others\r\nhave been suspended, to be resumed hereafter under circumstances more\r\nfavorable to success, and others are still in negotiation, with the hope\r\nthat they may be adjusted with mutual accommodation to the interests\r\nand to the satisfaction of the respective parties. It has been the\r\ninvariable object of this Government to cherish the most friendly\r\nrelations with every power, and on principles and conditions which might\r\nmake them permanent. A systematic effort has been made to place our\r\ncommerce with each power on a footing of perfect reciprocity, to settle\r\nwith each in a spirit of candor and liberality all existing differences,\r\nand to anticipate and remove so far as it might be practicable all\r\ncauses of future variance.\r\n\r\nIt having been stipulated by the seventh article of the convention of\r\nnavigation and commerce which was concluded on the 24th of June, 1822,\r\nbetween the United States and France, that the said convention should\r\ncontinue in force for two years from the 1st of October of that year,\r\nand for an indefinite term afterwards, unless one of the parties should\r\ndeclare its intention to renounce it, in which event it should cease\r\nto operate at the end of six months from such declaration, and no\r\nsuch intention having been announced, the convention having been\r\nfound advantageous to both parties, it has since remained, and still\r\nremains, in force. At the time when that convention was concluded many\r\ninteresting subjects were left unsettled, and particularly our claim to\r\nindemnity for spoliations which were committed on our commerce in the\r\nlate wars. For these interests and claims it was in the contemplation\r\nof the parties to make provision at a subsequent day by a more\r\ncomprehensive and definitive treaty. The object has been duly attended\r\nto since by the Executive, but as yet it has not been accomplished. It\r\nis hoped that a favorable opportunity will present itself for opening\r\na negotiation which may embrace and arrange all existing differences\r\nand every other concern in which they have a common interest upon the\r\naccession of the present King of France, an event which has occurred\r\nsince the close of the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nWith Great Britain our commercial intercourse rests on the same footing\r\nthat it did at the last session. By the convention of 1815 the commerce\r\nbetween the United States and the British dominions in Europe and the\r\nEast Indies was arranged on a principle of reciprocity. That convention\r\nwas confirmed and continued in force, with slight exceptions, by a\r\nsubsequent treaty for the term of ten years from the 20th of October,\r\n1818, the date of the latter. The trade with the British colonies in the\r\nWest Indies has not as yet been arranged, by treaty or otherwise, to our\r\nsatisfaction. An approach to that result has been made by legislative\r\nacts, whereby many serious impediments which had been raised by the\r\nparties in defense of their respective claims were removed. An earnest\r\ndesire exists, and has been manifested on the part of this Government,\r\nto place the commerce with the colonies, likewise, on a footing of\r\nreciprocal advantage, and it is hoped that the British Government,\r\nseeing the justice of the proposal and its importance to the colonies,\r\nwill ere long accede to it.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners who were appointed for the adjustment of the boundary\r\nbetween the territories of the United States and those of Great Britain,\r\nspecified in the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent, having disagreed\r\nin their decision, and both Governments having agreed to establish that\r\nboundary by amicable negotiation between them, it is hoped that it may\r\nbe satisfactorily adjusted in that mode. The boundary specified by the\r\nsixth article has been established by the decision of the commissioners.\r\nFrom the progress made in that provided for by the seventh, according to\r\na report recently received, there is good cause to presume that it will\r\nbe settled in the course of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nIt is a cause of serious regret that no arrangement has yet been finally\r\nconcluded between the two Governments to secure by joint cooperation\r\nthe suppression of the slave trade. It was the object of the British\r\nGovernment in the early stages of the negotiation to adopt a plan for\r\nthe suppression which should include the concession of the mutual right\r\nof search by the ships of war of each party of the vessels of the other\r\nfor suspected offenders. This was objected to by this Government on\r\nthe principle that as the right of search was a right of war of a\r\nbelligerent toward a neutral power it might have an ill effect to extend\r\nit by treaty, to an offense which had been made comparatively mild, to\r\na time of peace. Anxious however, for the suppression of this trade,\r\nit was thought advisable, in compliance with a resolution of the House\r\nof Representatives, founded on an act of Congress, to propose to the\r\nBritish Government an expedient which should be free from that objection\r\nand more effectual for the object, by making it piratical. In that\r\nmode the enormity of tho crime would place the offenders out of the\r\nprotection of their Government, and involve no question of search or\r\nother question between the parties touching their respective rights.\r\nIt was believed, also, that it would completely suppress the trade\r\nin the vessels of both parties, and by their respective citizens and\r\nsubjects in those of other powers, with whom it was hoped that the odium\r\nwhich would thereby be attached to it would produce a corresponding\r\narrangement, and by means thereof its entire extirpation forever. A\r\nconvention to this effect was concluded and signed in London on the\r\n13th day of March, 1824, by plenipotentiaries duly authorized by both\r\nGovernments, to the ratification of which certain obstacles have arisen\r\nwhich are not yet entirely removed. The difference between the parties\r\nstill remaining has been reduced to a point not of sufficient magnitude,\r\nas is presumed, to be permitted to defeat an object so near to the heart\r\nof both nations and so desirable to the friends of humanity throughout\r\nthe world. As objections, however, to the principle recommended by the\r\nHouse of Representatives, or at least to the consequences inseparable\r\nfrom it, and which are understood to apply to the law, have been raised,\r\nwhich may deserve a reconsideration of the whole subject, I have thought\r\nit proper to suspend the conclusion of a new convention until the\r\ndefinitive sentiments of Congress may be ascertained. These documents\r\nrelating to the negotiation are with that intent submitted to your\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nOur commerce with Sweden has been placed on a footing of perfect\r\nreciprocity by treaty, and with Russia, the Netherlands, Prussia,\r\nthe free Hanseatic cities, the Dukedom of Oldenburg, and Sardinia by\r\ninternal regulations on each side, founded on mutual agreement between\r\nthe respective Governments.\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which the commercial policy of the United States\r\nis founded are to be traced to an early period. They are essentially\r\nconnected with those upon which their independence was declared, and\r\nowe their origin to the enlightened men who took the lead in our\r\naffairs at that important epoch. They are developed in their first\r\ntreaty of commerce with France of 6th February, 1778, and by a formal\r\ncommission which was instituted immediately after the conclusion of\r\ntheir Revolutionary struggle, for the purpose of negotiating treaties\r\nof commerce with every European power. The first treaty of the United\r\nStates with Prussia, which was negotiated by that commission, affords\r\na signal illustration of those principles. The act of Congress of the\r\n3d March. 1815. adopted immediately after the return of a general peace,\r\nwas a new overture to foreign nations to establish our commercial\r\nrelations with them on the basis of free and equal reciprocity. That\r\nprinciple has pervaded all the acts of Congress and all the negotiations\r\nof the Executive on the subject since.\r\n\r\nA convention for the settlement of important questions in relation\r\nto the northwest coast of this continent and its adjoining seas was\r\nconcluded and signed at St. Petersburg on the 5th day of April last by\r\nthe minister plenipotentiary of the United States and plenipotentiaries\r\nof the Imperial Government of Russia. It will immediately be laid before\r\nthe Senate for the exercise of the constitutional authority of that body\r\nwith reference to its ratification. It is proper to add that the manner\r\nin which this negotiation was invited and conducted on the part of the\r\nEmperor has been very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe great and extraordinary changes which have happened in the\r\nGovernments of Spain and Portugal within the last two years, without\r\nseriously affecting the friendly relations which under all of them\r\nhave been maintained with those powers by the United States, have been\r\nobstacles to the adjustment of the particular subjects of discussion\r\nwhich have arisen with each. A resolution of the Senate adopted at their\r\nlast session called for information as to the effect produced upon our\r\nrelations with Spain by the recognition on the part of the United States\r\nof the independent South American Governments. The papers containing\r\nthat information are now communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nA chargé d'affaires has been received from the independent Government of\r\nBrazil. That country, heretofore a colonial possession of Portugal, had\r\nsome years since been proclaimed by the Sovereign of Portugal himself an\r\nindependent Kingdom. Since his return to Lisbon a revolution in Brazil\r\nhas established a new Government there with an imperial title, at the\r\nhead of which is placed a prince, in whom the regency had been vested by\r\nthe King at the time of his departure. There is reason to expect that by\r\namicable negotiation the independence of Brazil will ere long be\r\nrecognized by Portugal herself.\r\n\r\nWith the remaining powers of Europe, with those on the coast of Barbary,\r\nand with all the new South American States our relations are of a\r\nfriendly character. We have ministers plenipotentiary residing with the\r\nRepublics of Colombia and Chile, and have received ministers of the same\r\nrank from Colombia, Guatemala, Buenos Ayres, and Mexico. Our commercial\r\nrelations with all those States are mutually beneficial and increasing.\r\nWith the Republic of Colombia a treaty of commerce has been formed, of\r\nwhich a copy is received and the original daily expected. A negotiation\r\nfor a like treaty would have been commenced with Buenos Ayres had it not\r\nbeen prevented by the indisposition and lamented decease of Mr. Rodney,\r\nour minister there, and to whose memory the most respectful attention\r\nhas been shewn by the Government of that Republic. An advantageous\r\nalteration in our treaty with Tunis has been obtained by our consular\r\nagent residing there, the official document of which when received will\r\nbe laid before the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Government has been drawn with great solicitude\r\nto other subjects, and particularly to that relating to a state of\r\nmaritime war, involving the relative rights of neutral and belligerent\r\nin such wars. Most of the difficulties which we have experienced and of\r\nthe losses which we have sustained since the establishment of our\r\nindependence have proceeded from the unsettled state of those rights and\r\nthe extent to which the belligerent claim has been carried against the\r\nneutral party. It is impossible to look back on the occurrences of the\r\nlate wars in Europe, and to behold the disregard which was paid to our\r\nrights as a neutral power, and the waste which was made of our commerce\r\nby the parties to those wars by various acts of their respective\r\nGovernments, and under the pretext by each that the other had set the\r\nexample, without great mortification and a fixed purpose never to submit\r\nto the like in future. An attempt to remove those causes of possible\r\nvariance by friendly negotiation and on just principles which should\r\nbe applicable to all parties could, it was presumed, be viewed by none\r\nother than as a proof of an earnest desire to preserve those relations\r\nwith every power. In the late war between France and Spain a crisis\r\noccurred in which it seemed probable that all the controvertible\r\nprinciples involved in such wars might be brought into discussion and\r\nsettled to the satisfaction of all parties. Propositions having this\r\nobject in view have been made to the Governments of Great Britain,\r\nFrance, Russia, and of other powers, which have been received in a\r\nfriendly manner by all, but as yet no treaty has been formed with either\r\nfor its accomplishment. The policy will, it is presumed, be persevered\r\nin, and in the hope that it may be successful.\r\n\r\nIt will always be recollected that with one of the parties to those\r\nwars, and from whom we received those injuries, we sought redress by\r\nwar. From the other, by whose then reigning Government our vessels\r\nwere seized in port as well as at sea and their cargoes confiscated,\r\nindemnity has been expected, but has not yet been tendered. It was under\r\nthe influence of the latter that our vessels were likewise seized by\r\nthe Governments of Spain, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, and Naples, and\r\nfrom whom indemnity has been claimed and is still expected, with the\r\nexception of Spain, by whom it has been rendered. With both parties we\r\nhad abundant cause of war, but we had no alternative but to resist that\r\nwhich was most powerful at sea and pressed us nearest at home. With this\r\nall differences were settled by a treaty, founded on conditions fair and\r\nhonorable to both, and which has been so far executed with perfect good\r\nfaith. It has been earnestly hoped that the other would of its own\r\naccord, and from a sentiment of justice and conciliation, make to our\r\ncitizens the indemnity to which they are entitled, and thereby remove\r\nfrom our relations any just cause of discontent on our side.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury during the current\r\nyear, exclusive of loans, will exceed $18,500,000, which, with the sum\r\nremaining in the Treasury at the end of the last year, amounting to\r\n$9.463,922.81, will, after discharging the current disbursements of the\r\nyear, the interest on the public debt, and upward of $11,633,011.52 of\r\nthe principal, leave a balance of more than $3,000,000 in the Treasury\r\non the 1st day of January next.\r\n\r\nA larger amount of the debt contracted during the late war, bearing an\r\ninterest of 6 per cent, becoming redeemable in the course of the ensuing\r\nyear than could be discharged by the ordinary revenue, the act of the\r\n26th of May authorized a loan of $5,000,000 at 4-1/2 per cent to meet\r\nthe same. By this arrangement an annual saving will accrue to the public\r\nof $75,000.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of the 24th of May last a loan of $5,000,000 was\r\nauthorized, in order to meet the awards under the Florida treaty,\r\nwhich was negotiated at par with the Bank of the United States at 4-1/2\r\npercent, the limit of interest fixed by the act. By this provision the\r\nclaims of our citizens who had sustained so great a loss by spoliations,\r\nand from whom indemnity had been so long withheld, were promptly paid.\r\nFor these advances the public will be amply repaid at no distant day by\r\nthe sale of the lands in Florida. Of the great advantages resulting from\r\nthe acquisition of the Territory in other respects too high an estimate\r\ncan not be formed.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the receipts into the Treasury during the year\r\n1825 will be sufficient to meet the disbursements of the year,\r\nincluding the sum of $10,000,000, which is annually appropriated by\r\nthe act constituting the sinking fund to the payment of the principal\r\nand interest of the public debt.\r\n\r\nThe whole amount of the public debt on the 1st of January next may be\r\nestimated at $86,000,000, inclusive of $2,500,000 of the loan authorized\r\nby the act of the 26th of May last. In this estimate is included a stock\r\nof $7,000,000, issued for the purchase of that amount of the capital\r\nstock of the Bank of the United States, and which, as the stock of the\r\nbank still held by the Government will at least be fully equal to its\r\nreimbursement, ought not to be considered as constituting a part of the\r\npublic debt. Estimating, then, the whole amount of the public debt at\r\n$79,000,000 and regarding the annual receipts and expenditures of the\r\nGovernment, a well-founded hope may be entertained that, should no\r\nunexpected event occur, the whole of the public debt may be discharged\r\nin the course of ten years, and the Government be left at liberty\r\nthereafter to apply such portion of the revenue as may not be necessary\r\nfor current expenses to such other objects as may be most conducive\r\nto the public security and welfare. That the sums applicable to these\r\nobjects will be very considerable may be fairly concluded when it is\r\nrecollected that a large amount of the public revenue has been applied\r\nsince the late war to the construction of the public buildings in this\r\ncity; to the erection of fortifications along the coast and of arsenals\r\nin different parts of the Union; to the augmentation of the Navy; to the\r\nextinguishment of the Indian title to large tracts of fertile territory;\r\nto the acquisition of Florida; to pensions to Revolutionary officers and\r\nsoldiers, and to invalids of the late war. On many of these objects the\r\nexpense will annually be diminished and cease at no distant period on\r\nmost of them. On the 1st of January, 1817, the public debt amounted\r\nto $123,491,965.16, and, notwithstanding the large sums which have\r\nbeen applied to these objects, it has been reduced since that period\r\n$37,446,961.78. The last portion of the public debt will be redeemable\r\non the 1st of January, 1835, and while there is the best reason to\r\nbelieve that the resources of the Government will be continually\r\nadequate to such portions of it as may become due in the interval, it\r\nis recommended to Congress to seize every opportunity which may present\r\nitself to reduce the rate of interest on every part thereof. The high\r\nstate of the public credit and the great abundance of money are at this\r\ntime very favorable to such a result. It must be very gratifying to our\r\nfellow-citizens to witness this flourishing state of the public finances\r\nwhen it is recollected that no burthen whatever has been imposed upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe military establishment in all its branches, in the performance of\r\nthe various duties assigned to each, justifies the favorable view which\r\nwas presented of the efficiency of its organization at the last session.\r\nAll the appropriations have been regularly applied to the objects\r\nintended by Congress, and so far as the disbursements have been made the\r\naccounts have been rendered and settled without loss to the public.\r\nThe condition of the Army itself, as relates to the officers and men,\r\nin science and discipline is highly respectable. The Military Academy,\r\non which the Army essentially rests, and to which it is much indebted\r\nfor this state of improvement, has attained, in comparison with any\r\nother institution of a like kind, a high degree of perfection.\r\nExperience, however, has shewn that the dispersed condition of the corps\r\nof artillery is unfavorable to the discipline of that important branch\r\nof the military establishment. To remedy this inconvenience, eleven\r\ncompanies have been assembled at the fortification erected at Old Point\r\nComfort as a school for artillery instruction, with intention as they\r\nshall be perfected in the various duties of that service to order them\r\nto other posts, and to supply their places with other companies for\r\ninstruction in like manner. In this mode a complete knowledge of the\r\nscience and duties of this arm will be extended throughout the whole\r\ncorps of artillery.-But to carry this object fully into effect will\r\nrequire the aid of Congress, to obtain which the subject is now\r\nsubmitted to your consideration.\r\n\r\nOf the progress which has been made in the construction of\r\nfortifications for the permanent defense of our maritime frontier,\r\naccording to the plan decided on and to the extent of the existing\r\nappropriations, the report of the Secretary of War, which is herewith\r\ncommunicated, will give a detailed account. Their final completion can\r\nnot fail to give great additional security to that frontier, and to\r\ndiminish proportionably the expense of defending it in the event of war.\r\n\r\nThe provisions in the several acts of Congress of the last session for\r\nthe improvement of the navigation of the Mississippi and the Ohio, of\r\nthe harbor of Presqu'isle, on Lake Erie, and the repair of the Plymouth\r\nbeach are in a course of regular execution; and there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the appropriation in each instance will be adequate\r\nto the object. To carry these improvements fully into effect, the\r\nsuperintendence of them has been assigned to officers of the Corps\r\nof Engineers.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of 30th April last, authorizing the President to cause a\r\nsurvey to be made, with the necessary plans and estimates, of such roads\r\nand canals as he might deem of national importance in a commercial or\r\nmilitary point of view, or for the transportation of the mail, a board\r\nhas been instituted, consisting of two distinguished officers of the\r\nCorps of Engineers and a distinguished civil engineer, with assistants,\r\nwho have been actively employed in carrying into effect the object of\r\nthe act. They have carefully examined the route between the Potomac and\r\nthe Ohio rivers; between the latter and Lake Erie; between the Alleghany\r\nand the Susquehannah; and the routes between the Delaware and the\r\nRaritan, Barnstable and Buzzards Bay, and between Boston Harbor and\r\nNarraganset Bay. Such portion of the Corps of Topographical Engineers\r\nas could be spared from the survey of the coast has been employed in\r\nsurveying the very important route between the Potomac and the Ohio.\r\nConsiderable progress has been made in it, but the survey can not be\r\ncompleted until the next season. It is gratifying to add, from the view\r\nalready taken, that there is good cause to believe that this great\r\nnational object may be fully accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt is contemplated to commence early in the next season the execution of\r\nthe other branch of the act--that which relates to roads--and with the\r\nsurvey of a route from this city, through the Southern States, to New\r\nOrleans, the importance of which can not be too highly estimated. All\r\nthe officers of both the corps of engineers who could be spared from\r\nother services have been employed in exploring and surveying the routes\r\nfor canals. To digest a plan for both objects for the great purposes\r\nspecified will require a thorough knowledge of every part of our Union\r\nand of the relation of each part to the others and of all to the seat of\r\nthe General Government. For such a digest it will be necessary that the\r\ninformation be full, minute, and precise. With a view to these important\r\nobjects, I submit to the consideration of the Congress the propriety of\r\nenlarging both the corps of engineers--the military and topographical.\r\nIt need scarcely be remarked that the more extensively these corps are\r\nengaged in the improvement of their country, in the execution of the\r\npowers of Congress, and in aid of the States in such improvements as lie\r\nbeyond that limit, when such aid is desired, the happier the effect will\r\nbe in many views of which the subject is susceptible. By profiting of\r\ntheir science the works will always be well executed, and by giving to\r\nthe officers such employment our Union will derive all the advantage, in\r\npeace as well as in war, from their talents and services which they can\r\nafford. In this mode, also, the military will be incorporated with the\r\ncivil, and unfounded and injurious distinctions and prejudices of every\r\nkind be done away. To the corps themselves this service can not fail to\r\nbe equally useful, since by the knowledge they would thus acquire they\r\nwould be eminently better qualified in the event of war for the great\r\npurposes for which they were instituted.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Indian tribes within our limits have not been\r\nmaterially changed during the year. The hostile disposition evinced by\r\ncertain tribes on the Missouri during the last year still continues,\r\nand has extended in some degree to those on the Upper Mississippi and\r\nthe Upper Lakes. Several parties of our citizens have been plundered\r\nand murdered by those tribes. In order to establish relations of\r\nfriendship with them, Congress at the last session made an appropriation\r\nfor treaties with them and for the employment of a suitable military\r\nescort to accompany and attend the commissioners at the places appointed\r\nfor the negotiations. This object has not been effected. The season\r\nwas too far advanced when the appropriation was made and the distance\r\ntoo great to permit it, but measures have been taken, and all the\r\npreparations will be completed to accomplish it at an early period\r\nin the next season.\r\n\r\nBelieving that the hostility of the tribes, particularly on the Upper\r\nMississippi and the Lakes, is in no small degree owing to the wars which\r\nare carried on between the tribes residing in that quarter, measures\r\nhave been taken to bring about a general peace among them, which, if\r\nsuccessful, will not only tend to the security of our citizens, but\r\nbe of great advantage to the Indians themselves.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the tribes referred to, our relations with all\r\nthe others are on the same friendly footing, and it affords me great\r\nsatisfaction to add that they are making steady advances in civilization\r\nand the improvement of their condition. Many of the tribes have already\r\nmade great progress in the arts of civilized life. This desirable result\r\nhas been brought about by the humane and persevering policy of the\r\nGovernment, and particularly by means of the appropriation for the\r\ncivilization of the Indians. There have been established under the\r\nprovisions of this act 32 schools, containing 916 scholars, who are\r\nwell instructed in several branches of literature, and likewise in\r\nagriculture and the ordinary arts of life.\r\n\r\nUnder the appropriation to authorize treaties with the Creeks and\r\nQuaupaw Indians commissioners have been appointed and negotiations\r\nare now pending, but the result is not yet known.\r\n\r\nFor more full information respecting the principle which has been\r\nadopted for carrying into effect the act of Congress authorizing\r\nsurveys, with plans and estimates for canals and roads, and on every\r\nother branch of duty incident to the Department of War. I refer you\r\nto the report of the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe squadron in the Mediterranean has been maintained in the extent\r\nwhich was proposed in the report of the Secretary of the Navy of the\r\nlast year, and has afforded to our commerce the necessary protection\r\nin that sea. Apprehending, however, that the unfriendly relations which\r\nhave existed between Algiers and some of the powers of Europe might\r\nbe extended to us, it has been thought expedient to augment the force\r\nthere, and in consequence the _North Carolina_, a ship of the line,\r\nhas been prepared, and will sail in a few days to join it.\r\n\r\nThe force employed in the Gulf of Mexico and in the neighboring seas\r\nfor the suppression of piracy has likewise been preserved essentially in\r\nthe state in which it was during the last year. A persevering effort has\r\nbeen made for the accomplishment of that object, and much protection has\r\nthereby been afforded to our commerce, but still the practice is far\r\nfrom being suppressed. From every view which has been taken of the\r\nsubject it is thought that it will be necessary rather to augment than\r\nto diminish our force in that quarter. There is reason to believe that\r\nthe piracies now complained of are committed by bands of robbers who\r\ninhabit the land, and who, by preserving good intelligence with the\r\ntowns and seizing favorable opportunities, rush forth and fall on\r\nunprotected merchant vessels, of which they make an easy prey. The\r\npillage thus taken they carry to their lurking places, and dispose of\r\nafterwards at prices tending to seduce the neighboring population. This\r\ncombination is understood to be of great extent, and is the more to be\r\ndeprecated because the crime of piracy is often attended with the murder\r\nof the crews, these robbers knowing if any survived their lurking places\r\nwould be exposed and they be caught and punished. That this atrocious\r\npractice should be carried to such extent is cause of equal surprise and\r\nregret. It is presumed that it must be attributed to the relaxed and\r\nfeeble state of the local governments, since it is not doubted, from\r\nthe high character of the governor of Cuba, who is well known and much\r\nrespected here, that if he had the power he would promptly suppress\r\nit. Whether those robbers should be pursued on the land, the local\r\nauthorities be made responsible for these atrocities, or any other\r\nmeasure be resorted to to suppress them, is submitted to the\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn execution of the laws for the suppression of the slave trade a vessel\r\nhas been occasionally sent from that squadron to the coast of Africa\r\nwith orders to return thence by the usual track of the slave ships, and\r\nto seize any of our vessels which might be engaged in that trade. None\r\nhave been found, and it is believed that none are thus employed. It is\r\nwell known, however, that the trade still exists under other flags.\r\n\r\nThe health of our squadron while at Thompsons Island has been much\r\nbetter during the present than it was the last season. Some improvements\r\nhave been made and others are contemplated there which, it is believed,\r\nwill have a very salutary effect.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific our commerce has much increased, and on that coast, as\r\nwell as on that seas the United States have many important interests\r\nwhich require attention and protection. It is thought that all the\r\nconsiderations which suggested the expediency of placing a squadron\r\non that sea operate with augmented force for maintaining it there, at\r\nleast in equal extent.\r\n\r\nFor detailed information respecting the state of our maritime force\r\non each sea, the improvement necessary to be made on either in the\r\norganization of the naval establishment generally, and of the laws for\r\nits better government I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, which is herewith communicated.\r\n\r\nThe revenue of the Post-Office Department has received a considerable\r\naugmentation in the present year. The current receipts will exceed the\r\nexpenditures, although the transportation of the mail within the year\r\nhas been much increased. A report of the Postmaster-General, which is\r\ntransmitted, will furnish in detail the necessary information respecting\r\nthe administration and present state of this Department.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with a resolution of Congress of the last session, an\r\ninvitation was given to General Lafayette to visit the United States,\r\nwith an assurance that a ship of war should attend at any port of France\r\nwhich he might designate, to receive and convey him across the Atlantic,\r\nwhenever it might be convenient for him to sail. He declined the offer\r\nof the public ship from motives of delicacy, but assured me that he\r\nhad long intended and would certainly visit our Union in the course of\r\nthe present year. In August last he arrived at New York, where he was\r\nreceived with the warmth of affection and gratitude to which his very\r\nimportant and disinterested services and sacrifices in our Revolutionary\r\nstruggle so eminently entitled him. A corresponding sentiment has since\r\nbeen manifested in his favor throughout every portion of our Union, and\r\naffectionate invitations have been given him to extend his visits to\r\nthem. To these he has yielded all the accommodation in his power.\r\nAt every designated point of rendezvous the whole population of the\r\nneighboring country has been assembled to greet him, among whom it\r\nhas excited in a peculiar manner the sensibility of all to behold the\r\nsurviving members of our Revolutionary contest, civil and military, who\r\nhad shared with him in the toils and dangers of the war, many of them\r\nin a decrepit state. A more interesting spectacle, it is believed, was\r\nnever witnessed, because none could be founded on purer principles, none\r\nproceed from higher or more disinterested motives. That the feelings\r\nof those who had fought and bled with him in a common cause should\r\nhave been much excited was natural. There are, however, circumstances\r\nattending these interviews which pervaded the whole community and\r\ntouched the breasts of every age, even the youngest among us. There\r\nwas not an individual present who had not some relative who had not\r\npartaken in those scenes, nor an infant who had not heard the relation\r\nof them. But the circumstance which was most sensibly felt, and which\r\nhis presence brought forcibly to the recollection of all, was the great\r\ncause in which we were engaged and the blessings which we have derived\r\nfrom our success in it. The struggle was for independence and liberty,\r\npublic and personal, and in this we succeeded. The meeting with one who\r\nhad borne so distinguished a part in that great struggle, and from such\r\nlofty and disinterested motives, could not fail to affect profoundly\r\nevery individual and of every age. It is natural that we should all take\r\na deep interest in his future welfare, as we do. His high claims on our\r\nUnion are felt, and the sentiment universal that they should be met in\r\na generous spirit. Under these impressions I invite your attention to\r\nthe subject, with a view that, regarding his very important services,\r\nlosses, and sacrifices, a provision may be made and tendered to him\r\nwhich shall correspond with the sentiments and be worthy the character\r\nof the American people.\r\n\r\nIn turning our attention to the condition of the civilized world,\r\nin which the United States have always taken a deep interest, it is\r\ngratifying to see how large a portion of it is blessed with peace.\r\nThe only wars which now exist within that limit are those between\r\nTurkey and Greece, in Europe, and between Spain and the new Governments,\r\nour neighbors, in this hemisphere. In both these wars the cause of\r\nindependence, of liberty and humanity, continues to prevail. The success\r\nof Greece, when the relative population of the contending parties is\r\nconsidered, commands our admiration and applause, and that it has had a\r\nsimilar effect with the neighboring powers is obvious. The feeling of\r\nthe whole civilized world is excited in a high degree in their favor.\r\nMay we not hope that these sentiments, winning on the hearts of their\r\nrespective Governments, may lead to a more decisive result; that they\r\nmay produce an accord among them to replace Greece on the ground which\r\nshe formerly held, and to which her heroic exertions at this day so\r\neminently entitle her?\r\n\r\nWith respect to the contest to which our neighbors are a party, it is\r\nevident that Spain as a power is scarcely felt in it. These new States\r\nhad completely achieved their independence before it was acknowledged by\r\nthe United States, and they have since maintained it with little foreign\r\npressure. The disturbances which have appeared in certain portions of\r\nthat vast territory have proceeded from internal causes, which had their\r\norigin in their former Governments and have not yet been thoroughly\r\nremoved. It is manifest that these causes are daily losing their effect,\r\nand that these new States are settling down under Governments elective\r\nand representative in every branch, similar to our own. In this course\r\nwe ardently wish them to persevere, under a firm conviction that it will\r\npromote their happiness. In this, their career, however, we have not\r\ninterfered, believing that every people have a right to institute for\r\nthemselves the government which, in their judgment, may suit them best.\r\nOur example is before them, of the good effect of which, being our\r\nneighbors, they are competent judges, and to their judgment we leave\r\nit, in the expectation that other powers will pursue the same policy.\r\nThe deep interest which we take in their independence, which we have\r\nacknowledged, and in their enjoyment of all the rights incident\r\nthereto, especially in the very important one of instituting their own\r\nGovernments, has been declared, and is known to the world. Separated as\r\nwe are from Europe by the great Atlantic Ocean, we can have no concern\r\nin the wars of the European Governments nor in the causes which produce\r\nthem. The balance of power between them, into whichever scale it may\r\nturn in its various vibrations, can not affect us. It is the interest\r\nof the United States to preserve the most friendly relations with every\r\npower and on conditions fair, equal, arid applicable to all. But in\r\nregard to our neighbors our situation is different. It is impossible\r\nfor the European Governments to interfere in their concerns, especially\r\nin those alluded to, which are vital, without affecting us; indeed, the\r\nmotive which might induce such interference in the present state of the\r\nwar between the parties, if a war it may be called, would appear to be\r\nequally applicable to us. It is gratifying to know that some of the\r\npowers with whom we enjoy a very friendly intercourse, and to whom\r\nthese views have been communicated, have appeared to acquiesce in them.\r\n\r\nThe augmentation of our population with the expansion of our Union and\r\nincreased number of States have produced effects in certain branches\r\nof our system which merit the attention of Congress. Some of our\r\narrangements, and particularly the judiciary establishment, were made\r\nwith a view to the original thirteen States only. Since then the United\r\nStates have acquired a vast extent of territory; eleven new States have\r\nbeen admitted into the Union, and Territories have been laid off for\r\nthree others, which will likewise be admitted at no distant day. An\r\norganization of the Supreme Court which assigns to the judges any\r\nportion of the duties which belong to the inferior, requiring their\r\npassage over so vast a space under any distribution of the States that\r\nmay now be made, if not impracticable in the execution, must render\r\nit impossible for them to discharge the duties of either branch with\r\nadvantage to the Union. The duties of the Supreme Court would be of\r\ngreat importance if its decisions were confined to the ordinary limits\r\nof other tribunals, but when it is considered that this court decides,\r\nand in the last resort, on all the great questions which arise under our\r\nConstitution, involving those between the United States individually,\r\nbetween the States and the United States, and between the latter and\r\nforeign powers, too high an estimate of their importance can not be\r\nformed. The great interests of the nation seem to require that the\r\njudges of the Supreme Court should be exempted from every other duty\r\nthan those which are incident to that high trust. The organization of\r\nthe inferior courts would of course be adapted to circumstances. It is\r\npresumed that such an one might be formed as would secure an able and\r\nfaithful discharge of their duties, and without any material\r\naugmentation of expense.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the aborigines within our limits, and especially\r\nthose who are within the limits of any of the States, merits likewise\r\nparticular attention. Experience has shown that unless the tribes be\r\ncivilized they can never be incorporated into our system in any form\r\nwhatever. It has likewise shown that in the regular augmentation of\r\nour population with the extension of our settlements their situation\r\nwill become deplorable, if their extinction is not menaced. Some\r\nwell-digested plan which will rescue them from such calamities is due\r\nto their rights, to the rights of humanity, and to the honor of the\r\nnation. Their civilization is indispensable to their safety, and this\r\ncan be accomplished only by degrees. The process must commence with the\r\ninfant state, through whom some effect may be wrought on the parental.\r\nDifficulties of the most serious character present themselves to the\r\nattainment of this very desirable result on the territory on which they\r\nnow reside. To remove them from it by force, even with a view to their\r\nown security and happiness, would be revolting to humanity and utterly\r\nunjustifiable. Between the limits of our present States and Territories\r\nand the Rocky Mountains and Mexico there is a vast territory to which\r\nthey might be invited with inducements which might be successful. It is\r\nthought if that territory should be divided into districts by previous\r\nagreement with the tribes now residing there and civil governments be\r\nestablished in each, with schools for every branch of instruction in\r\nliterature and the arts of civilized life, that all the tribes now\r\nwithin our limits might gradually be drawn there. The execution of\r\nthis plan would necessarily be attended with expense, and that not\r\ninconsiderable, but it is doubted whether any other can be devised\r\nwhich would be less liable to that objection or more likely to succeed.\r\n\r\nIn looking to the interests which the United States have on the\r\nPacific Ocean and on the western coast of this continent, the propriety\r\nof establishing a military post at the mouth of Columbia River, or at\r\nsome other point in that quarter within our acknowledged limits, is\r\nsubmitted to the consideration of Congress. Our commerce and fisheries\r\non that sea and along the coast have much increased and are increasing.\r\nIt is thought that a military post, to which our ships of war might\r\nresort, would afford protection to every interest, and have a tendency\r\nto conciliate the tribes to the northwest, with whom our trade is\r\nextensive. It is thought also that by the establishment of such a post\r\nthe intercourse between our Western States and Territories and the\r\nPacific and our trade with the tribes residing in the interior on each\r\nside of the Rocky Mountains would be essentially promoted. To carry this\r\nobject into effect the appropriation of an adequate sum to authorize the\r\nemployment of a frigate, with an officer of the Corps of Engineers,\r\nto explore the mouth of the Columbia River and the coast contiguous\r\nthereto, to enable the Executive to make such establishment at the most\r\nsuitable point, is recommended to Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that attention is also due to the improvement of this\r\ncity. The communication between the public buildings and in various\r\nother parts and the grounds around those buildings require it. It is\r\npresumed also that the completion of the canal from the Tiber to the\r\nEastern Branch would have a very salutary effect. Great exertions have\r\nbeen made and expenses incurred by the citizens in improvements of\r\nvarious kinds; but those which are suggested belong exclusively to the\r\nGovernment, or are of a nature to require expenditures beyond their\r\nresources. The public lots which are still for sale would, it is not\r\ndoubted, be more than adequate to these purposes.\r\n\r\nFrom the view above presented it is manifest that the situation of the\r\nUnited States is in the highest degree prosperous and happy. There is no\r\nobject which as a people we can desire which we do not possess or which\r\nis not within our reach. Blessed with governments the happiest which the\r\nworld ever knew, with no distinct orders in society or divided interests\r\nin any portion of the vast territory over which their dominion extends,\r\nwe have every motive to cling together which can animate a virtuous and\r\nenlightened people. The great object is to preserve these blessings,\r\nand to hand them down to the latest posterity. Our experience ought to\r\nsatisfy us that our progress under the most correct and provident policy\r\nwill not be exempt from danger. Our institutions form an important epoch\r\nin the history of the civilized world. On their preservation and in\r\ntheir utmost purity everything will depend. Extending as our interests\r\ndo to every part of the inhabited globe and to every sea to which our\r\ncitizens are carried by their industry and enterprise, to which they are\r\ninvited by the wants of others, and have a right to go, we must either\r\nprotect them in the enjoyment of their rights or abandon them in certain\r\nevents to waste and desolation. Our attitude is highly interesting as\r\nrelates to other powers, and particularly to our southern neighbors. We\r\nhave duties to perform with respect to all to which we must be faithful.\r\nTo every kind of danger we should pay the most vigilant and unceasing\r\nattention, remove the cause where it may be practicable, and be prepared\r\nto meet it when inevitable.\r\n\r\nAgainst foreign danger the policy of the Government seems to be already\r\nsettled. The events of the late war admonished us to make our maritime\r\nfrontier impregnable by a well-digested chain of fortifications, and\r\nto give efficient protection to our commerce by augmenting our Navy\r\nto a certain extent, which has been steadily pursued, and which it is\r\nincumbent upon us to complete as soon as circumstances will permit.\r\nIn the event of war it is on the maritime frontier that we shall be\r\nassailed. It is in that quarter, therefore, that we should be prepared\r\nto meet the attack. It is there that our whole force will be called\r\ninto action to prevent the destruction of our towns and the desolation\r\nand pillage of the interior. To give full effect to this policy great\r\nimprovements will be indispensable. Access to those works by every\r\npracticable communication should be made easy and in every direction.\r\nThe intercourse between every part of our Union should also be promoted\r\nand facilitated by the exercise of those powers which may comport with\r\na faithful regard to the great principles of our Constitution. With\r\nrespect to internal causes, those great principles point out with\r\nequal certainty the policy to be pursued. Resting on the people as\r\nour Governments do, State and National, with well-defined powers,\r\nit is of the highest importance that they severally keep within the\r\nlimits prescribed to them. Fulfilling that sacred duty, it is of equal\r\nimportance that the movement between them be harmonious, and in case\r\nof any disagreement, should any such occur, a calm appeal be made to\r\nthe people, and that their voice be heard and promptly obeyed. Both\r\nGovernments being instituted for the common good, we can not fail to\r\nprosper while those who made them are attentive to the conduct of their\r\nrepresentatives and control their measures. In the pursuit of these\r\ngreat objects let a generous spirit and national views and feelings be\r\nindulged, and let every part recollect that by cherishing that spirit\r\nand improving the condition of the others in what relates to their\r\nwelfare the general interest will not only be promoted, but the local\r\nadvantage be reciprocated by all.\r\n\r\nI can not conclude this communication, the last of the kind which I\r\nshall have to make, without recollecting with great sensibility and\r\nheartfelt gratitude the many instances of the public confidence and the\r\ngenerous support which I have received from my fellow-citizens in the\r\nvarious trusts with which I have been honored. Having commenced my\r\nservice in early youth, and continued it since with few and short\r\nintervals, I have witnessed the great difficulties to which our Union\r\nhas been exposed, and admired the virtue and intelligence with which\r\nthey have been surmounted. From the present prosperous and happy state\r\nI derive a gratification which I can not express. That these blessings\r\nmay be preserved and perpetuated will be the object of my fervent and\r\nunceasing prayers to the Supreme Ruler of the Universe.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 6, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to a resolution of the House of Representatives of the 13th of\r\nMay last, requesting the President to cause to be made and submitted to\r\nthe House on the first day of the next [present] session of Congress a\r\nfull and complete statement of the exact number of lots belonging to\r\nthe United States in the city of Washington which have been sold by the\r\npublic agents for that purpose; when sold, by whom, to whom, and for\r\nwhat price each lot was purchased; what part of the purchase money has\r\nbeen paid, the amount due, and by whom due, and when payable; whether\r\nthe debts are well secured, and whether the money received has been\r\napplied, to what purposes, and by whom, I herewith transmit a report and\r\nstatements from the Commissioner of Public Buildings, which will afford\r\nthe information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 13, 1824.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with an act of Congress which originated in the House\r\nof Representatives, passed the 26th of May, 1824, \"to authorize the\r\nPresident of the United States to enter into certain negotiations\r\nrelative to lands located under Virginia military land warrants, lying\r\nbetween Ludlow's and Roberts's lines, in the State of Ohio,\" I herewith\r\ntransmit a report, with accompanying documents, from the Commissioner\r\nof the General Land Office, shewing the measures which have been taken\r\nunder the provisions of the aforesaid act.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 13, 1824_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE PRO TEMPORE:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a convention, negotiated and signed by Samuel\r\nD.

Mr. Gallatin arrived with his family\r\nat New York on the 24th of that month.\r\n\r\nI inclose herewith copies of the recent correspondence between the\r\nCount de Menou, the chargé d'affaires of France, and this Department\r\non various subjects highly interesting to the relations between the\r\ntwo countries.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Count's note of the 11th of July, the President\r\nreceived with great satisfaction the testimonial of the Viscount de\r\nChateaubriand to the candor and ability with which Mr. Gallatin has\r\nperformed the duties of his official station in France. The proposal\r\nto renew the negotiation in behalf of the well-founded claims of our\r\ncitizens upon the French Government in _connection_ with a claim on\r\nthe part of France to special privileges in the ports of Louisiana,\r\nwhich, after a very full discussion, had in the views of this Government\r\nbeen proved utterly groundless, could neither be accepted nor considered\r\nas evidence of the same conciliatory spirit. The claims of our citizens\r\nare for mere justice; they are for reparation of unquestionable\r\nwrongs--for indemnity or restitution of property taken from them or\r\ndestroyed without shadow or color of right. The claim under the eighth\r\narticle of the Louisiana convention has nothing to rest upon but a\r\nforced construction of the terms of the stipulation, which the American\r\nGovernment considered, and have invariably considered, as totally\r\nwithout foundation. These are elements not to be coupled together in the\r\nsame negotiation, and while we yet trust to the final sense of justice\r\nof France for the adjustment of the righteous claims of our citizens, we\r\nstill hope that their unquestionable character will ultimately secure\r\nto them a consideration unencumbered with other discussions. You will\r\nrespectfully make this representation to the Viscount de Chateaubriand,\r\nwith the assurance of the readiness of this Government to discuss the\r\nquestion upon the Louisiana convention further if desired by France,\r\nbut of our final conviction that it is not to be blended with the claims\r\nof our citizens for mere justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Count de Menou to Mr. Adams_.\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\nLEGATION OF FRANCE TO THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_Washington, July 11, 1823_.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable SECRETARY OF STATE:\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Viscount de Chateaubriand, in announcing to me that\r\nMr. Gallatin was about to leave France, expresses his regret at his\r\ndeparture in such terms that I should do him injustice were I not to use\r\nhis own expressions. \"My correspondence with this minister,\" he remarks\r\nto me, \"has caused me to appreciate his talents, his ability, and his\r\nattachment to the system of friendship that unites the two powers. It\r\nis with regret that I suspend my communications with him.\"\r\n\r\nI esteem myself happy, sir, in conveying to you such sentiments toward\r\nthe representative of the United States in France, and I should have\r\nthought that I had but imperfectly apprehended the design of the\r\nViscount de Chateaubriand had I neglected to communicate them to the\r\nFederal Government.\r\n\r\nThe minister for foreign affairs reminds me also on this occasion that\r\nMr. Gallatin having frequently laid before him claims of Americans\r\nagainst the French Government, he had shown himself disposed to enter\r\nupon a general negotiation, in which they should be comprehended with\r\nclaims of French citizens against the Federal Government at the same\r\ntime with the arrangement relative to the execution of the eighth\r\narticle of the treaty of Louisiana, The object of his excellency was to\r\narrive at a speedy and friendly disposition of all difficulties that\r\nmight subsist between the two powers, well assured that France and the\r\nUnited States would be found to have the same views of justice and\r\nconciliation.\r\n\r\nHis excellency regrets that Mr. Gallatin, who, he says, \"has convinced\r\nhim how pleasing and advantageous it is to negotiate with a statesman\r\nwho exhibits candor and ability in his discussions,\" did not receive\r\nfrom his Government during his stay in France the necessary powers for\r\nthis double negotiation. But he informs me that the Government of His\r\nMajesty remains always disposed to open it, either with Mr. Gallatin\r\nshould he return with these powers, or with Mr. Sheldon if the Federal\r\nGovernment should think proper to confer them on him.\r\n\r\nI greatly desire, sir, to see these propositions acceded to by the\r\nFederal Government and to be able to reply to his excellency, as he\r\nexpresses his wish that an arrangement putting an end to every subject\r\nof discussion might soon be expected.\r\n\r\nI pray the Secretary of State to receive the renewed assurance of my\r\nhigh consideration.\r\n\r\nThe chargé d'affaires of France near the United States,\r\n\r\nMENOU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Adams to Count de Menou_.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, August 12, 1823_.\r\n\r\nThe COUNT DE MENOU,\r\n\r\n_Chargé d'Affaires from France_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Your letter of the 11th of last month has been submitted to the\r\nconsideration of the President of the United States, by whom I am\r\ndirected to express the high satisfaction that he has felt at the manner\r\nin which His Excellency the Viscount de Chateaubriand has noticed in\r\nhis correspondence with you the temporary absence of Mr. Gallatin from\r\nFrance and the terms of regard and esteem with which he notices the\r\ncharacter and conduct of that minister. The anxious desire of the\r\nPresident for the promotion of the good understanding between the United\r\nStates and France could not be more gratified than by the testimonial of\r\nHis Most Christian Majesty's Government to the good faith and ability\r\nwith which the minister of the United States at his Court has performed\r\nhis official duties.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the assurance of His Excellency the Viscount de\r\nChateaubriand's disposition to enter upon a negotiation with Mr.\r\nGallatin in the event of his return to France, or with Mr. Sheldon\r\nduring his absence, concerning the claims of citizens of the United\r\nStates on the Government of France in connection with an arrangement\r\nconcerning the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty, I am directed to\r\nobserve that those subjects rest upon grounds so totally different that\r\nthe Government of the United States can not consent to connect them\r\ntogether in negotiation.\r\n\r\nThe claims of the citizens of the United States upon the French\r\nGovernment have been of many years' standing, often represented by\r\nsuccessive ministers of the United States, and particularly by Mr.\r\nGallatin during a residence of seven years, with a perspicuity of\r\nstatement and a force of evidence which could leave to the Government\r\nof the United States no desire but that they should have been received\r\nwith friendly attention and no regret but that they should have proved\r\nineffectual. The justice of these claims has never been denied by\r\nFrance, and while the United States are still compelled to wait for\r\ntheir adjustment, similar and less forceful claims of the subjects of\r\nother nations have been freely admitted and liquidated.\r\n\r\nA long and protracted discussion has already taken place between the\r\ntwo Governments in relation to the claim of France under the eighth\r\narticle of the Louisiana convention, the result of which has been a\r\nthorough conviction on the part of the American Government that the\r\nclaim has no foundation in the treaty whatever. The reasons for this\r\nconviction have been so fully set forth in the discussion that it was\r\nnot anticipated a further examination of it would be thought desirable.\r\nAs a subject of discussion, however, the American Government is willing\r\nto resume it whenever it may suit the views of France to present further\r\nconsiderations relating to it; but while convinced that the claim is\r\nentirely without foundation, they can not place it on a footing of\r\nconcurrent negotiation with claims of their citizens, the justice of\r\nwhich is so unequivocal that they have not even been made the subject\r\nof denial.\r\n\r\nFrom the attention which His Excellency the Viscount de Chateaubriand\r\nhas intimated his willingness to give to the consideration of these\r\nclaims the President indulges the hope that they will be taken into view\r\nupon their own merits, and in that hope the representative of the United\r\nStates at Paris will at an early day be instructed to present them again\r\nto the undivided and unconditional sense of the justice of France.\r\n\r\nI pray you, sir, to accept the renewed assurance of my distinguished\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Extract of a letter from Mr, Sheldon (No. 2) to Mr, Adams, dated\r\nParis, October 16, 1823.]\r\n\r\nI took an early occasion after the receipt of your dispatch No. 1, of\r\nthe 10th August, to communicate the subjects of it in a conversation\r\nI had with Viscount de Chateaubriand. His observations in relation to\r\nthat of the claims, as connected with the pretensions of France under\r\nthe Louisiana treaty, were of a very general nature and amounted to\r\nlittle more than a repetition of his readiness to enter upon the\r\nconsideration of whatever subjects of discussion might exist between the\r\ntwo countries and the expression of his satisfaction at the prospect of\r\nbeing soon relieved from the labor which the affairs of Spain had thrown\r\nupon him, and having thus more time to devote to those of the United\r\nStates and others not of the same pressing nature. He avoided any\r\nintimation of a disposition to take up the claims by themselves, and\r\nit can hardly be expected that the French Government will at this time\r\nrelax from the ground they have so lately taken upon that point. I\r\ninformed him that I should communicate in writing an answer to the\r\noverture made by Count de Menou at Washington for uniting in a new\r\nnegotiation this subject with that of the Louisiana treaty, in substance\r\nthe same as that gentleman had already received there, and should again\r\npress upon the French Government the consideration of the claims by\r\nthemselves; to which he replied that any communication I might make\r\nwould be received and treated with all the attention to which it was\r\nentitled on his part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Sheldon to the Viscount de Chateaubriand_.\r\n\r\nPARIS, _October 11, 1823_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Mr. Gallatin, during his residence as minister of the United\r\nStates in France, had upon various occasions called the attention\r\nof His Majesty's Government to the claims of our citizens for the\r\nreparation of wrongs sustained by them from the unjust seizure,\r\ndetention, and confiscation of their property by officers and agents\r\nacting under authority of the Government of France. During the past\r\nyear His Majesty's ministers had consented to enter upon the\r\nconsideration of these claims, but they proposed to couple with it\r\nanother subject having no connection with those claims, either in its\r\nnature, its origin, or the principles on which it depended--a question\r\nof the disputed construction of one of the articles of the treaty of\r\ncession of Louisiana, by virtue of which France claimed certain\r\ncommercial privileges in the ports of that Province. Mr. Gallatin had\r\nnot received from his Government any authority to connect these two\r\ndissimilar subjects in the same negotiation, or, indeed, to treat upon\r\nthe latter, which had already been very amply discussed at Washington\r\nbetween the Secretary of State of the United States and His Majesty's\r\nminister at that place, without producing any result except a conviction\r\non the part of the Government of the United States that the privileges\r\nfor French vessels, as claimed by the minister of France, never could\r\nhave been, and were not in fact, conceded by the treaty in question.\r\nA stop was then put to the negotiations already commenced in relation\r\nto the claims, and with which had been united, on the proposition of\r\nthe French Government, and as being naturally connected with it, the\r\nconsideration of certain claims of French citizens on the Government\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe chargé d'affaires of France at Washington has lately, on behalf\r\nof his Government, expressed to that of the United States a wish that\r\nthis double negotiation might be resumed and that a definitive\r\narrangement might be made as well in relation to the disputed article of\r\nthe Louisiana treaty as of the subject of the claims upon the one side\r\nand upon the other. The Government of the United States has nothing\r\nmore at heart than to remove by friendly arrangements every subject of\r\ndifference which may exist between the two countries, and to examine\r\nwith the greatest impartiality and good faith as well the nature and\r\nextent of the stipulations into which they have entered as the appeals\r\nto their justice made by individuals claiming reparation for wrongs\r\nsupposed to have been sustained at their hands.\r\n\r\nBut these two subjects are essentially dissimilar; there are no points\r\nof connection between them; the principles upon which they depend are\r\ntotally different; they have no bearing upon each other; and the justice\r\nwhich is due to individuals ought not to be delayed or made dependent\r\nupon the right or the wrong interpretation by one or the other party of\r\na treaty having for its object the regulation of entirely distinct and\r\ndifferent interests.\r\n\r\nThe reclamations of American citizens upon the Government of France\r\nare for mere justice--for the reparation of unquestionable wrongs,\r\nindemnity or restitution of property taken from them or destroyed\r\nforcibly and without right. They are of ancient date, and justice has\r\nbeen long and anxiously waited for. They have been often represented to\r\nthe Government of France, and their validity is not disputed. Similar\r\nreclamations without greater merit or stronger titles to admission\r\npresented by citizens of other nations have been favorably received,\r\nexamined, and liquidated, and it seems to have been hitherto reserved\r\nto those of the United States alone to meet with impediments at every\r\njuncture and to seek in vain the moment in which the Government of\r\nFrance could consent to enter upon their consideration. Although the\r\nquestion arising under the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty has\r\nalready been fully examined, the Government of the United States is\r\nready, if it is desired by France, and if it is thought that any new\r\nlight can be thrown upon it, to discuss the subject further whenever it\r\nshall be presented anew by France to their consideration. But they are\r\nconvinced that by blending it with the claims not only will no progress\r\nbe made toward its solution, but that these last, standing upon their\r\nown unquestionable character, ought not to be trammeled with a subject\r\nto which they are wholly foreign.\r\n\r\nI am instructed to bring them anew before your excellency, and to\r\nexpress the hope of the President that His Majesty's Government will not\r\ncontinue to insist upon connecting together two subjects of so different\r\na nature, but that the claims may be taken up on their own merits and\r\nreceive the consideration which they deserve, unencumbered with other\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nI request your excellency to accept the assurance, etc,\r\n\r\nD. SHELDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Extracts of a letter from the Secretary of State to Mr. Brown, dated\r\nWashington, December 23, 1823.]\r\n\r\nYou will immediately after your reception earnestly call the attention\r\nof the French Government to the claims of our citizens for indemnity.\r\n\r\nYou will at the same time explicitly make known that this Government\r\ncan not consent to connect this discussion with that of the pretension\r\nraised by France on the construction given by her to the eighth article\r\nof the Louisiana cession treaty. The difference in the nature and\r\ncharacter of the two interests is such that they can not with propriety\r\nbe blended together. The claims are of reparation to individuals for\r\ntheir property taken from them by manifest and undisputed wrong. The\r\nquestion upon the Louisiana treaty is a question of _right_ upon the\r\nmeaning of a contract. It has been fully, deliberately, and thoroughly\r\ninvestigated, and the Government of the United States is under the\r\nentire and solemn conviction that the pretension of France is utterly\r\nunfounded. We are, nevertheless, willing to resume the discussion if\r\ndesired by France; but to refuse justice to individuals unless the\r\nUnited States will accede to the construction of an article in a treaty\r\ncontrary to what they believe to be its real meaning would be not only\r\nincompatible with the principles of equity, but submitting to a species\r\nof compulsion derogatory to the honor of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Extract of a letter (No. 2) from James Brown, envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary of the United States, dated April 28, 1824.]\r\n\r\nI have in a letter to M. de Chateaubriand, copy of which I have now the\r\nhonor to send, made an effort to separate the claims of our citizens\r\nfrom the Louisiana question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Brown to M. de Chateaubriand_.\r\n\r\nPARIS, _April 28, 1824_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency VISCOUNT DE CHATEAUBRIAND,\r\n\r\n_Minister of Foreign Affairs, etc_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In the conference with which your excellency honored me a few\r\ndays ago I mentioned a subject deeply interesting to many citizens\r\nof the United States, on which I have been instructed to address your\r\nexcellency, and to which I earnestly wish to call your immediate\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to your excellency that my predecessor, Mr. Gallatin,\r\nduring several years made repeated and urgent applications to His\r\nMajesty's Government for the adjustment of claims to a very large\r\namount, affecting the interests of American citizens and originating in\r\ngross violations of the law of nations and of the rights of the United\r\nStates, and that he never could obtain from France either a settlement\r\nof those claims or even an examination and discussion of their validity.\r\nTo numerous letters addressed by him to His Majesty's ministers on that\r\nsubject either no answers were given or answers which had for their only\r\nobject to postpone the investigation of the subject. Whilst, however,\r\nhe indulged the hope that these delays would be abandoned, and that the\r\nrights of our citizens, which had been urged for so many years, would at\r\nlength be taken up for examination, he learned with surprise and regret\r\nthat His Majesty's Government had determined to insist that they should\r\nbe discussed in connection with the question of the construction of\r\nthe eighth article of the Louisiana treaty of cession. Against this\r\ndetermination he strongly but ineffectually remonstrated in a letter\r\nto Mr. De Villele, dated the 12th November, 1822.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that the Government of the United States, whenever\r\nrequested by that of His Majesty, have uniformly agreed to discuss any\r\nsubject presented for their consideration, whether the object has been\r\nto obtain the redress of public or private injuries. Acting upon this\r\nprinciple, the question of the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty\r\nwas, upon the suggestion of the minister of France, made the subject of\r\na voluminous correspondence, in the course of which all the arguments\r\nof the parties respectively were fully made known to each other and\r\nexamined. The result of this discussion has been a thorough conviction\r\non the part of the Government of the United States that the construction\r\nof that article of the treaty contended for by France is destitute of\r\nany solid foundation and wholly inadmissible. After a discussion so\r\nfull as to exhaust every argument on that question, the attempt to\r\nrenew it in connection with the question of the claims of our citizens\r\nappeared to the Government of the United States to be a measure so\r\ncontrary to the fair and regular course of examining controverted\r\npoints between nations that they instructed Mr, Sheldon, their chargé\r\nd'affaires, to prepare and present a note explaining their views of the\r\nproceeding, which he delivered on the 11th of October, 1823. To this\r\nnote no answer has ever been received.\r\n\r\nI have the express instructions of the Government again to call the\r\nattention of that of His Majesty to this subject, and to insist that\r\nthe claims of our citizens may continue to be discussed as a distinct\r\nquestion, without connecting it in any way with the construction of the\r\nLouisiana treaty. The two subjects are in every respect dissimilar. The\r\ndifference in the nature and character of the two interests is such as\r\nto prevent them from being blended in the same discussion. The claims\r\nagainst France are of reparation to individuals for their property taken\r\nfrom them by undisputed wrong and injustice; the claim of France under\r\nthe treaty is that of a right founded on a contract. In the examination\r\nof these questions the one can impart no light to the other; they are\r\nwholly unconnected, and ought on every principle to undergo a distinct\r\nand separate examination. To involve in the same investigation the\r\nindisputable rights of American citizens to indemnity for losses and\r\nthe doubtful construction of a treaty can have no other effect than to\r\noccasion an indefinite postponement of the reparation due to individuals\r\nor a sacrifice on the part of the Government of the United States of a\r\ntreaty stipulation in order to obtain that reparation. The United States\r\nwould hope that such an alternative will not be pressed upon them by the\r\nGovernment of His Majesty.\r\n\r\nWhilst I indulge a hope that the course to which I have objected will no\r\nlonger be insisted on by His Majesty's ministers, permit me to renew to\r\nyour excellency the sincere assurance that the United States earnestly\r\ndesire that every subject of difference between the two countries should\r\nbe amicably adjusted and all their relations placed upon the most\r\nfriendly footing. Although they believe that any further discussion of\r\nthe eighth article of the Louisiana treaty would be wholly unprofitable,\r\nthey will be at all times ready to renew the discussion of that article\r\nor to examine any question which may remain to be adjusted between them\r\nand France.\r\n\r\nI request your excellency to accept, etc.\r\n\r\nJAMES BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Extract of a letter (No. 3) from James Brown to the Secretary of State,\r\ndated Paris, May 11, 1824.]\r\n\r\nI have the honor to inclose a copy of the answer of the minister of\r\nforeign affairs to the letter which I addressed to him on the 27th\r\nultimo, upon the subject of the claims of our citizens against the\r\nFrench Government. You will perceive that no change has been made in\r\nthe determination expressed to Mr. Gallatin of connecting in the same\r\ndiscussion the question on the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty\r\nof cession and the claims of the citizens of the United States against\r\nFrance. In expressing this resolution it has not been considered\r\nnecessary even to notice the arguments made use of to induce them\r\nto adopt a different opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Viscount Chateaubriand to Mr. Brown_.\r\n\r\n[Translation.]\r\n\r\nPARIS, _May 7, 1824_.\r\n\r\nSIR: The object of the letter which you did me the honor to address to\r\nme on the 28th of April is to recall the affair of American claims,\r\nalready repeatedly called up by your predecessors, that they may be\r\nregulated by an arrangement between the two powers, and that in this\r\nnegotiation the examination of the difficulties which were raised about\r\nthe execution of the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty should not\r\nbe included.\r\n\r\nAlthough the claims made by France upon this last point be of a\r\ndifferent nature from those of the Americans, yet no less attention\r\nought to be paid to arrange both in a just and amicable manner.\r\n\r\nOur claims upon the eighth article had already been laid before the\r\nFederal Government by His Majesty's plenipotentiary when he was\r\nnegotiating the commercial convention of 24th June, 1822.\r\n\r\nThe negotiators not agreeing upon a subject so important, the King's\r\nGovernment did not wish this difficulty to suspend any longer the\r\nconclusion of an arrangement which might give more activity to commerce\r\nand multiply relations equally useful to the two powers. It reserves to\r\nitself the power of comprehending this object in another negotiation,\r\nand it does not renounce in any manner the claim which it urged.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason, sir, that my predecessors and myself have\r\nconstantly insisted that the arrangements to be made upon the eighth\r\narticle of the Louisiana treaty should be made a part of those which\r\nyour Government were desirous of making upon other questions still at\r\nissue.\r\n\r\nIt is the intention of His Majesty not to leave unsettled any subject\r\nof grave discussion between the two States, and the King is too well\r\nconvinced of the friendly sentiments of your Government not to believe\r\nthat the United States will be disposed to agree with France on all the\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty authorizes me, sir, to declare to you that a negotiation\r\nwill be opened with you upon the American claims if this negotiation\r\nshould also include the French claims, and particularly the arrangements\r\nto be concluded concerning the execution of the eighth article of the\r\nLouisiana treaty.\r\n\r\nAccept, sir, the assurances of the very distinguished consideration with\r\nwhich I have the honor to be, etc.,\r\n\r\nCHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Extracts of a letter (No. 4) from the Secretary of State to Mr. Brown,\r\ndated Department of State, Washington, August 14, 1824.]\r\n\r\nThe subject which has first claimed the attention of the President\r\nhas been the result of your correspondence with the Viscount de\r\nChateaubriand in relation to the claims of numerous citizens of\r\nthe United States upon the justice of the French Government.\r\n\r\nI inclose herewith a copy of the report of the Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations of the House of Representatives upon several petitions\r\naddressed to that body at their last session by some of those claimants\r\nand a resolution of the House adopted thereupon.\r\n\r\nThe President has deliberately considered the purport of M. de\r\nChateaubriand's answer to your note of the 28th of April upon this\r\nsubject, and he desires that you will renew with earnestness the\r\napplication for indemnity to our citizens for claims notoriously just\r\nand resting upon the same principle with others which have been admitted\r\nand adjusted by the Government of France.\r\n\r\nIn the note of the Viscount de Chateaubriand to you of 7th May it is\r\nsaid that he is authorized to declare a negotiation will be opened with\r\nyou upon the American claims if this negotiation should also include\r\nFrench claims, and particularly the arrangements to be concluded\r\nconcerning the execution of the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty.\r\n\r\nYou are authorized in reply to declare that any just claims which\r\nsubjects of France may have upon the Government of the United States\r\nwill readily be included in the negotiation, and to stipulate any\r\nsuitable provision for the examination, adjustment, and satisfaction\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nBut the question relating to the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty\r\nis not only of a different character--it can not be blended with that of\r\nindemnity for individual claims without a sacrifice on the part of the\r\nUnited States of a principle of right. The negotiation for indemnity\r\npresupposes that wrong has been done, that indemnity ought to be made,\r\nand the object of any treaty stipulation concerning it can only be to\r\nascertain what is justly due and to make provision for the payment of\r\nit. By consenting to connect with such a negotiation that relating to\r\nthe eighth article of the Louisiana convention the United States would\r\nabandon the _principle_ upon which the whole discussion concerning\r\nit depends. The situation of the parties to the negotiation would be\r\nunequal. The United States, asking reparation for admitted wrong, are\r\ntold that France will not discuss it with them unless they will first\r\nrenounce their own sense of right to admit and discuss with it a claim\r\nthe _justice_ of which they have constantly denied.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States is prepared to renew the discussion\r\nwith that of France relating to the eighth article of the Louisiana\r\ntreaty in any manner which may be desired and by which they shall not\r\nbe understood to admit that France has _any_ claim under it whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Brown to Mr. Adams_ (_No. 12_).\r\n\r\nPARIS, _August 12, 1824_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Some very unimportant changes have taken place in the composition\r\nof the ministry. The Baron de Damas, late minister of war, is now\r\nminister of foreign affairs; the Marquis de Clermont Tonnese is\r\nappointed to the department of war, and the Count Chabrol de Crousal\r\nto that of the marine.\r\n\r\nThese appointments are believed to correspond with the wishes of the\r\npresident of the Council of Ministers, and do not inspire a hope that\r\nour claims will be more favorably attended to than they have been under\r\nthe former administrations. The interpretation of the eighth article\r\nof the Louisiana treaty contended for by France will, I apprehend,\r\nbe persisted in and all indemnity refused until it shall have been\r\ndiscussed and decided. After the correspondence which has already passed\r\nupon that article, it would appear that any further discussion upon it\r\nwould be wholly unprofitable. With a view, however, of ascertaining the\r\nopinions of the minister of foreign affairs, I shall at an early day\r\nsolicit a conference with him, and inform you of the result.\r\n\r\nI have had the honor of receiving your letter recommending the claim of\r\nMr. Kingston to my attention. The difficulties which that claim must\r\nexperience, from its antiquity and from the operation of the treaty of\r\n1803, can not have escaped your observation. It has also to encounter,\r\nin common with all our claims, the obstacle presented by the eighth\r\narticle, which is found broad enough to be used as a shield to protect\r\nFrance, in the opinion of ministers, from the examination and adjustment\r\nof any claim which we can present.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, sir, your most obedient and\r\nhumble servant,\r\n\r\nJAMES BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Brown to Mr. Adams_ (_No. 14_).\r\n\r\nPARIS, _September 28, 1824_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Little has occurred of importance during the present month, except\r\nthe death of the King. This event had been anticipated for nearly a\r\nyear; he had declined gradually, and the affairs of the Government\r\nhave been for some time almost wholly directed by Monsieur, who on his\r\naccession to the throne has declared that his reign would be only a\r\ncontinuation of that of the late King. No change in the policy of the\r\nGovernment is expected, and probably none in the composition of the\r\nministry. The present King is satisfied with Mr. De Villele, who is at\r\nits head; and if any of its members should be changed the spirit in\r\nwhich public affairs are directed will not, it is believed, be affected\r\nby that circumstance.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies attending the change of the Crown have principally\r\noccupied the public attention for the last fortnight. It will, I\r\npresume, be officially announced by the French minister at Washington,\r\nand, according to the forms observed here, will, I understand, require\r\nfresh letters of credence for all foreign ministers at this Court,\r\naddressed to the new King.\r\n\r\nMy health has not permitted me (having been confined for some weeks to\r\nthe bed by a rheumatic affection) to confer with the Baron de Damas on\r\nour affairs since his appointment as minister of the foreign department.\r\nI should regret this the more if I were not satisfied that the same\r\nimpulse will direct the decisions of the Government upon these points\r\nnow as before he had this department in charge, and that no favorable\r\nchange in those decisions can be expected from any personal influence\r\nwhich might be exerted by the new minister. I shall, however, take the\r\nearliest opportunity that my health will allow to mention the subject\r\nto him and ascertain what his views of it are.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, sir, your most obedient and\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\nJAMES BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Extracts of a letter from Mr. James Brown to Mr, Adams (No. 16).]\r\n\r\nPARIS, _October 23, 1824_.\r\n\r\nThe packet ship which sailed from New York on the 1st of September\r\nbrought me the letter which you did me the honor to address to me on\r\nthe 14th of August.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the instructions contained in that letter, I have\r\naddressed one to the Baron de Damas, minister of foreign affairs, a copy\r\nof which I now inclose. I expect to receive his answer in time to be\r\nsent by the packet which will sail from Havre on the 1st of next month,\r\nin which event it may probably reach Washington about the 15th of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nThe recent changes which have been made in the ministry, of which I have\r\nalready informed you, do not justify any very strong expectation that a\r\nchange of measures in relation to our affairs at this Court will follow.\r\nThe same individuals fill different places in the ministry from those\r\nwhich they formerly held, but in all probability adhere to their former\r\nopinions in relation to the subjects of discussion between the United\r\nStates and France. On the point to which my letter to the Baron de\r\nDamas particularly relates the Count de Villele has already given his\r\ndeliberate views in his letters to Mr. Gallatin dated 6th and 15th\r\nNovember, 1822, and I have every reason to believe that they remain\r\nunchanged. Having bestowed much attention on the subject, it is probable\r\nhis opinion will be in a great measure decisive as to the answer which\r\nshall be given to my letter. It is the opinion of many well-informed men\r\nthat in the course of a few months important changes will be made in the\r\ncomposition of the ministry. As these changes, however, will proceed\r\nfrom causes wholly unconnected with foreign affairs, I am by no means\r\nsanguine in my expectations that under any new composition of the\r\nministry we may hope for a change of policy as it relates to our claims.\r\nThe eighth article of the Louisiana treaty will be continually put\r\nforward as a bar to our claims and its adjustment urged as often as\r\nwe renew our claim for indemnity.\r\n\r\nThe Journal des Débats of this morning states that at a superior council\r\nof commerce and of the colonies at which His Majesty yesterday presided\r\nMr. De St. Cricq, president of the bureau de commerce, made a report on\r\nthe commercial convention of the 24th June, 1822, between the United\r\nStates and France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Brown to Baron de Damas_.\r\n\r\nPARIS, _October 22, 1824_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency BARON DE DAMAS,\r\n\r\n_Minister of Foreign Affairs, etc_.\r\n\r\nSIR: I availed myself of the earliest opportunity to transmit to my\r\nGovernment a copy of the letter which I had the honor to address to the\r\nViscount de Chateaubriand on the 28th day of April last, together with\r\na copy of his answer to that letter, dated 7th of May.\r\n\r\nAfter a candid and deliberate consideration of the subject of that\r\ncorrespondence, my Government has sent me recent instructions to\r\nrenew with earnestness the application, already so frequently and so\r\nineffectually made, for indemnity to our citizens for claims notoriously\r\njust, and resting on the same principles with others which have been\r\nadmitted and adjusted by the Government of France.\r\n\r\nIn reply to that part of the Viscount de Chateaubriand's letter in\r\nwhich he offers to open with me a negotiation upon American claims if\r\nthat negotiation should also include French claims, and particularly\r\nthe arrangements to be concluded concerning the eighth article of the\r\nLouisiana treaty, I have been instructed to declare that any just claims\r\nwhich the subjects of France may have upon the Government of the United\r\nStates will readily be embraced in the negotiation, and that I am\r\nauthorized to stipulate any suitable provision for the examination,\r\nadjustment, and satisfaction of them.\r\n\r\nThe question relating to the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty is\r\nviewed by my Government as one of a very different character. It can\r\nnot be blended with that of indemnity for individual claims without\r\na sacrifice on the part of the United States of a principle of right.\r\nEvery negotiation for indemnity necessarily presupposes that some wrong\r\nhas been done, and that indemnity ought to be made; and the object of\r\nevery treaty stipulation respecting it can only be to ascertain the\r\nextent of the injury, and to make provision for its adequate reparation.\r\nThis is precisely the nature of the negotiation for American claims\r\nwhich has been for so many years the subject of discussion between\r\nthe Governments of the United States and of France. The wrongs done to\r\nour citizens have never been denied, whilst their right to indemnity\r\nhas been established by acts done by the French Government in cases\r\ndepending upon the same principles under which they derive their claim.\r\nBy consenting to connect with such a negotiation that relating to the\r\neighth article of the Louisiana treaty the United States would abandon\r\nthe principle upon which the whole discussion depends. When asking for\r\nreparation for acknowledged wrong the United States have been told that\r\nFrance will not discuss it with them unless they will first renounce\r\ntheir own sense of right and admit and discuss in connection with it a\r\nclaim the justice of which they have hitherto constantly denied. In any\r\nnegotiation commenced under such circumstances the situation of the\r\nparties would be unequal. By consenting to connect the pretensions of\r\nFrance under the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty with claims for\r\nindemnity for acknowledged injustice and injury the United States would\r\nbe understood as admitting that those pretensions were well founded;\r\nthat wrong had been done to France for which reparation ought to be\r\nmade. The Government of the United States, not having yet been convinced\r\nthat this is the case, can not consent to any arrangement which shall\r\nimply an admission so contrary to their deliberate sense of right.\r\n\r\nI am authorized and prepared on behalf of the United States to enter\r\nupon a further discussion of the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty\r\nin any manner which may be desired, and by which they shall not be\r\nunderstood previously to admit that the construction of that article\r\nclaimed by France is well founded; and also to renew the separate\r\nnegotiation for American claims, embracing at the same time all just\r\nclaims winch French subjects may have upon the Government of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe change which has lately taken place in His Majesty's department of\r\nforeign affairs encourages the hope that this important subject will\r\nbe candidly reconsidered; that the obstacles which have arrested the\r\nprogress of the negotiation may be removed, and that the subjects of\r\ncontestation between the two Governments may be ultimately adjusted upon\r\nsuch principles as may perpetuate the good understanding and harmony\r\nwhich have so long subsisted between the United States and France.\r\n\r\nShould I, however, be disappointed in the result of this application,\r\nit is to be seriously apprehended that as the United States have not\r\nhitherto seen in the course of the discussion any just claim of France\r\narising from the eighth article of the Louisiana treaty, so in the\r\npersevering refusal of the French Government to discuss and adjust\r\nthe well-founded claims of citizens of the United States to indemnity\r\nfor wrongs unless in connection with one which they are satisfied\r\nis unfounded the United States will ultimately perceive only a\r\ndetermination to deny justice to the claimants.\r\n\r\nPermit me respectfully to request that at as early a day as your\r\nconvenience will allow your excellency will favor me with an answer\r\nto this letter.\r\n\r\nI embrace with pleasure this occasion to offer to your excellency the\r\nrenewed assurance, etc.,\r\n\r\nJAMES BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 24, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n23d December, 1823, requesting that a negotiation should be opened with\r\nthe British Government \"for the cession of so much land on the island of\r\nAbaco at or near the Hole-in-the-Wall, and on such other places within\r\nthe acknowledged dominions of that power on the islands, keys, or shoals\r\nof the Bahama Banks as may be necessary for the erection and support of\r\nlight-houses, beacons, buoys, or floating lights for the security of\r\nnavigation over or near the said banks, and to be used solely for that\r\npurpose,\" directions were given to the minister of the United States at\r\nLondon on the 1st of January, 1824, to communicate the purport of that\r\nresolution to the Government of Great Britain with a view to their\r\nacceding to the wish of this; and I transmit to the House copies of Mr.\r\nRush's correspondence upon this subject, communicating the result of\r\nhis application to the British Government.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 28, 1824_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 27th instant, requesting information explanatory of the character\r\nand objects of the visit of the naval officer of the United States\r\ncommanding in the West Indies to the town of Faxyardo, in the island\r\nof Porto Rico, on the ---- day of November last, I herewith transmit\r\na report of the Secretary of the Navy, with a letter from Commodore\r\nPorter, which contains all the information in possession of the\r\nExecutive on the subject.\r\n\r\nDeeming the transactions adverted to of high importance, an order has\r\nbeen sent to Commodore Porter to repair hither without delay, that all\r\nthe circumstances connected therewith may be fully investigated.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAs the term of my service in this high trust will expire at the end\r\nof the present session of Congress, I think it proper to invite your\r\nattention to an object very interesting to me, and which in the movement\r\nof our Government is deemed on principle equally interesting to the\r\npublic. I have been long in the service of my country and in its most\r\ndifficult conjunctures, as well abroad as at home, in the course of\r\nwhich I have had a control over the public moneys to a vast amount.\r\nIf in the course of my service it shall appear on the most severe\r\nscrutiny, which I invite, that the public have sustained any loss by\r\nany act of mine, or of others for which I ought to be held responsible,\r\nI am willing to bear it. If, on the other hand, it shall appear on a\r\nview of the law and of precedents in other cases that justice has been\r\nwithheld from me in any instance, as I have believed it to be in many,\r\nand greatly to my injury, it is submitted whether it ought not to be\r\nrendered. It is my wish that all matters of account and claims between\r\nmy country and myself be settled with that strict regard to justice\r\nwhich is observed in settlements between individuals in private life.\r\nIt would be gratifying to me, and it appears to be just, that the\r\nsubject should be now examined in both respects with a view to a\r\ndecision hereafter. No bill would, it is presumed, be presented for my\r\nsignature which would operate either for or against me, and I would\r\ncertainly sanction none in my favor. While here I can furnish testimony,\r\napplicable to any case, in both views, which a full investigation may\r\nrequire, and the committee to whom the subject may be referred, by\r\nreporting facts now with a view to a decision after my retirement, will\r\nallow time for further information and due consideration of all matters\r\nrelating thereto. Settlements with a person in this trust, which could\r\nnot be made with the accounting officers of the Government, should\r\nalways be made by Congress and before the public. The cause of the delay\r\nin presenting these claims will be explained to the committee to whom\r\nthe subject may be referred. It will, I presume, be made apparent that\r\nit was inevitable; that from the peculiar circumstances attending each\r\ncase Congress alone could decide on it, and that from considerations of\r\ndelicacy it would have been highly improper for me to have sought it\r\nfrom Congress at an earlier period than that which is now proposed--the\r\nexpiration of my term in this high trust.\r\n\r\nOther considerations appear to me to operate with great force in\r\nfavor of the measure which I now propose. A citizen who has long served\r\nhis country in its highest trusts has a right, if he has served with\r\nfidelity, to enjoy undisturbed tranquillity and peace in his retirement.\r\nThis he can not expect to do unless his conduct in all pecuniary\r\nconcerns shall be placed by severe scrutiny on a basis not to be shaken.\r\nThis, therefore, forms a strong motive with me for the inquiry which I\r\nnow invite. The public may also derive considerable advantage from the\r\nprecedent in the future movement of the Government. It being known that\r\nsuch scrutiny was made in my case, it may form a new and strong barrier\r\nagainst the abuse of the public confidence in future.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 10, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI should hasten to communicate to you the documents called for by the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of the 4th instant, relating\r\nto the conduct of the officers of the Navy of the United States on the\r\nPacific Ocean and of other public agents in South America, if such a\r\ncommunication might now be made consistently with the public interest or\r\nwith justice to the parties concerned. In consequence of several charges\r\nwhich have been alleged against Commodore Stewart, touching his conduct\r\nwhile commanding the squadron of the United States on that sea, it has\r\nbeen deemed proper to suspend him from duty and to subject him to trial\r\non these charges. It appearing also that some of those charges have been\r\ncommunicated to the Department by Mr. Prevost, political agent at this\r\ntime of the United States at Peru, and heretofore at Buenos Ayres and\r\nChile, and apparently with his sanction, and that charges have likewise\r\nbeen made against him by citizens of the United States engaged in\r\ncommerce in that quarter, it has been thought equally just and proper\r\nthat he should attend here, as well to furnish the evidence in his\r\npossession applicable to the charges exhibited against Commodore\r\nStewart as to answer such as have been exhibited against himself.\r\n\r\nIn this stage the publication of those documents might tend to excite\r\nprejudices which might operate to the injury of both. It is important\r\nthat the public servants in every station should perform their duty with\r\nfidelity, according to the injunctions of the law and the orders of the\r\nExecutive in fulfillment thereof. It is peculiarly so that this should\r\nbe done by the commanders of our squadrons, especially on distant seas,\r\nand by political agents who represent the United States with foreign\r\npowers, for reasons that are obvious in both instances. It is due to\r\ntheir rights and to the character of the Government that they be not\r\ncensured without just cause, which can not be ascertained until, on\r\na view of tho charges, they are heard in their defense, and after a\r\nthorough and impartial investigation of their conduct. Under these\r\ncircumstances it is thought that a communication at this time of those\r\ndocuments would not comport with the public interest nor with what is\r\ndue to the parties concerned.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 13, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with two resolutions of the Senate, the first of the\r\n21st and the second of the 23d December last, requesting information\r\nrespecting the injuries which have been sustained by our citizens by\r\npiratical depredations, and other details connected therewith, and\r\nrequesting also information of the measures which have been adopted for\r\nthe suppression of piracy, and whether in the opinion of the Executive\r\nit will not be necessary to adopt other means for the accomplishment\r\nof the object, and, in that event, what other means it will be most\r\nadvisable to recur to, I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, and likewise a report from the Secretary of the Navy, with\r\nthe documents referred to in each.\r\n\r\nOn the very important question submitted to the Executive as to the\r\nnecessity of recurring to other more effectual means for the suppression\r\nof a practice so destructive of the lives and property of our citizens,\r\nI have to observe that three expedients occur--one by the pursuit of the\r\noffenders to the settled as well as the unsettled parts of the island\r\nfrom whence they issue, another by reprisal on the property of the\r\ninhabitants, and a third by the blockade of the ports of those islands.\r\nIt will be obvious that neither of these measures can be resorted to\r\nin a spirit of amity with Spain otherwise than in a firm belief that\r\nneither the Government of Spain nor the government of either of the\r\nislands has the power to suppress that atrocious practice, and that the\r\nUnited States interposed their aid for the accomplishment of an object\r\nwhich is of equal importance to them as well as to us. Acting on this\r\nprinciple, the facts which justify the proceeding being universally\r\nknown and felt by all engaged in commerce in that sea, it may fairly be\r\npresumed that neither will the Government of Spain nor the government\r\nof either of those islands complain of a resort to either of those\r\nmeasures, or to all of them, should such resort be necessary. It is\r\ntherefore suggested that a power commensurate with either resource be\r\ngranted to the Executive, to be exercised according to his discretion\r\nand as circumstances may imperiously require. It is hoped that the\r\nmanifestation of a policy so decisive will produce the happiest result;\r\nthat it will rid these seas and this hemisphere of this practice. This\r\nhope is strengthened by the belief that the Government of Spain and the\r\ngovernments of the islands, particularly of Cuba, whose chief is known\r\nhere, will faithfully cooperate in such measures as may be necessary\r\nfor the accomplishment of this very important object. To secure such\r\ncooperation will be the earnest desire and, of course, the zealous\r\nand persevering effort of the Executive.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 17, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its advice and consent as to the\r\nratification, a treaty which has been concluded by a commissioner duly\r\nauthorized for the purpose with the Quapaw Indians in Arkansas for the\r\ncession of their claim to the lands in that Territory. I transmit also\r\na report from the Secretary of War, with other documents, relating to\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 17, 1825.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the resolution of the Senate of 19th May last, requesting\r\nthe President to cause to be laid before the Senate a report \"shewing\r\nthe amount of duties which shall have accrued on importations into the\r\nUnited States for the three quarters of a year ending June 30, 1824;\r\nalso the amount of duties which would have accrued on the same\r\nimportations at such higher rates of duty as may be imposed by any act\r\nof the present session of Congress,\" I herewith transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, which contains the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 18, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith to both Houses of Congress copies of the\r\nconvention between the United States and His Majesty the Emperor of\r\nall the Russias, concluded at St. Petersburg on the 5th (17th) of April\r\nlast, which has been duly ratified on both sides, and the ratifications\r\nof which were exchanged on the 11th instant.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 20, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n19th of December, 1822, requesting the President to communicate \"what\r\nprogress has been made in the execution of the act of the last session\r\nentitled 'An act to abolish the Indian trading establishments,' with\r\na report from the factories, respectively, as the same may be made to\r\nhim,\" I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nwith documents, which contains the information requested.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 27, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nBeing deeply impressed with the opinion that the removal of the Indian\r\ntribes from the lands which they now occupy within the limits of the\r\nseveral States and Territories to the country lying westward and\r\nnorthward thereof, within our acknowledged boundaries, is of very\r\nhigh importance to our Union, and may be accomplished on conditions and\r\nin a manner to promote the interest and happiness of those tribes, the\r\nattention of the Government has been long drawn with great solicitude\r\nto the object. For the removal of the tribes within the limits of the\r\nState of Georgia the motive has been peculiarly strong, arising from\r\nthe compact with that State whereby the United States are bound to\r\nextinguish the Indian title to the lands within it whenever it may\r\nbe done peaceably and on reasonable conditions. In the fulfillment of\r\nthis compact, I have thought that the United States should act with a\r\ngenerous spirit; that they should omit nothing which should comport with\r\na liberal construction of the instrument and likewise be in accordance\r\nwith the just rights of those tribes. From the view which I have taken\r\nof the subject I am satisfied that in the discharge of these important\r\nduties in regard to both the parties alluded to the United States will\r\nhave to encounter no conflicting interests with either. On the contrary,\r\nthat the removal of the tribes from the territory which they now inhabit\r\nto that which was designated in the message at the commencement of\r\nthe session, which would accomplish the object for Georgia, under a\r\nwell-digested plan for their government and civilization, which should\r\nbe agreeable to themselves, would not only shield them from impending\r\nruin, but promote their welfare and happiness. Experience has clearly\r\ndemonstrated that in their present state it is impossible to incorporate\r\nthem in such masses, in any form whatever, into our system. It has also\r\ndemonstrated with equal certainty that without a timely anticipation\r\nof and provision against the dangers to which they are exposed, under\r\ncauses which it will be difficult, if not impossible, to control, their\r\ndegradation and extermination will be inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe great object to be accomplished is the removal of these tribes to\r\nthe territory designated on conditions which shall be satisfactory to\r\nthemselves and honorable to the United States. This can be done only by\r\nconveying to each tribe a good title to an adequate portion of land to\r\nwhich it may consent to remove, and by providing for it there a system\r\nof internal government which shall protect their property from invasion,\r\nand, by the regular progress of improvement and civilization, prevent\r\nthat degeneracy which has generally marked the transition from the one\r\nto the other state.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, which presents\r\nthe best estimate which can be formed, from the documents in that\r\nDepartment, of the number of Indians within our States and Territories\r\nand of the amount of lands held by the several tribes within each; of\r\nthe state of the country lying northward and westward thereof, within\r\nour acknowledged boundaries; of the parts to which the Indian title has\r\nalready been extinguished, and of the conditions on which other parts,\r\nin an amount which may be adequate to the object contemplated, may be\r\nobtained. By this report it appears that the Indian title has already\r\nbeen extinguished to extensive tracts in that quarter, and that other\r\nportions maybe acquired to the extent desired on very moderate\r\nconditions. Satisfied I also am that the removal proposed is not only\r\npracticable, but that the advantages attending it to the Indians may be\r\nmade so apparent to them that all the tribes, even those most opposed,\r\nmay be induced to accede to it at no very distant day.\r\n\r\nThe digest of such a government, with the consent of the Indians,\r\nwhich should be endowed with sufficient power to meet all the objects\r\ncontemplated--to connect the several tribes together in a bond of amity\r\nand preserve order in each; to prevent intrusions on their property;\r\nto teach them by regular instruction the arts of civilized life and make\r\nthem a civilized people--is an object of very high importance. It is\r\nthe powerful consideration which we have to offer to these tribes as\r\nan inducement to relinquish the lands on which they now reside and\r\nto remove to those which are designated. It is not doubted that this\r\narrangement will present considerations of sufficient force to surmount\r\nall their prejudices in favor of the soil of their nativity, however\r\nstrong they may be. Their elders have sufficient intelligence to discern\r\nthe certain progress of events in the present train, and sufficient\r\nvirtue, by yielding to momentary sacrifices, to protect their families\r\nand posterity from inevitable destruction. They will also perceive that\r\nthey may thus attain an elevation to which as communities they could not\r\notherwise aspire.\r\n\r\nTo the United States the proposed arrangement offers many important\r\nadvantages in addition to those which have been already enumerated.\r\nBy the establishment of such a government over these tribes with\r\ntheir consent we become in reality their benefactors. The relation of\r\nconflicting interests which has heretofore existed between them and our\r\nfrontier settlements will cease. There will be no more wars between them\r\nand the United States. Adopting such a government, their movement will\r\nbe in harmony with us, and its good effect be felt throughout the whole\r\nextent of our territory to the Pacific. It may fairly be presumed that,\r\nthrough the agency of such a government, the condition of all the tribes\r\ninhabiting that vast region may be essentially improved; that permanent\r\npeace may be preserved with them, and our commerce be much extended.\r\n\r\nWith a view to this important object I recommend it to Congress to\r\nadopt, by solemn declaration, certain fundamental principles in accord\r\nwith those above suggested, as the basis of such arrangements as may\r\nbe entered into with the several tribes, to the strict observance of\r\nwhich the faith of the nation shall be pledged, I recommend it also to\r\nCongress to provide by law for the appointment of a suitable number\r\nof commissioners who shall, under the direction of the President, be\r\nauthorized to visit and explain to the several tribes the objects of\r\nthe Government, and to make with them, according to their instructions,\r\nsuch arrangements as shall be best calculated to carry those objects\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nA negotiation is now depending with the Creek Nation for the cession of\r\nlands held by it within the limits of Georgia, and with a reasonable\r\nprospect of success. It is presumed, however, that the result will not\r\nbe known during the present session of Congress. To give effect to this\r\nnegotiation and to the negotiations which it is proposed to hold with\r\nall the other tribes within the limits of the several States and\r\nTerritories on the principles and for the purposes stated, it is\r\nrecommended that an adequate appropriation be now made by Congress.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 27, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a treaty concluded in this city with a\r\ndeputation from the Choctaw Indians, accompanied with the report from\r\nthe Secretary of War, with a copy of the correspondence connected with\r\nthe negotiations, for the advice and consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 2, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith to both Houses of Congress copies of the\r\nalterations in the treaty of peace and friendship of August, 1797,\r\nbetween the United States and the Bashaw Bey of Tunis, concluded at\r\nthe Palace of Bardo, near Tunis, on the 24th of February last, and\r\nof treaties between the United States and the Sock and Fox tribes of\r\nIndians and the Ioway tribe of Indians, concluded at the city of\r\nWashington on the 4th of August last, which have been duly ratified.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 4, 1825_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE:\r\n\r\nIt appearing by certain provisions contained in a late act of the\r\ngeneral assembly of Virginia, entitled \"An act incorporating the\r\nChesapeake and Ohio Canal Company,\" that the assent of Congress will\r\nbe necessary to carry the said act into effect, I herewith transmit\r\na copy thereof, that it may be considered with a view to the object\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n[The same message was sent to the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 7, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the House a report from the Secretary of State,\r\nwith copies of the correspondence relating to the claims of the citizens\r\nof the United States upon the Government of the Netherlands, requested\r\nby a resolution of the House of the 18th of January last.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 11, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nJanuary 5, I herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nwith copies of the proceedings of the courts-martial in the cases of\r\nLieutenants Weaver and Conner.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 14, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of War, with a report\r\nto him by the Chief Engineer, of the examination which has been made by\r\nthe Board of Engineers for Internal Improvement, in obedience to their\r\ninstructions, of the country between the Potomac and Ohio rivers,\r\nbetween the latter and Lake Erie, between the Allegheny and Schuylkill\r\nrivers, the Delaware and the Raritan, between Buzzards and Barnstable\r\nbays, and the Narraganset roads and Boston Harbor, with explanatory\r\nobservations on each route. From the view which I have taken of these\r\nreports I contemplate results of incalculable advantage to our Union,\r\nbecause I see in them the most satisfactory proof that certain\r\nimpediments which had a tendency to embarrass the intercourse between\r\nsome of its most important sections may be removed without serious\r\ndifficulty, and that facilities may be afforded in other quarters which\r\nwill have the happiest effect. Of the right in Congress to promote these\r\ngreat results by the appropriation of the public money, in harmony\r\nwith the States to be affected by them, having already communicated\r\nmy sentiments fully and on mature consideration, I deem it unnecessary\r\nto enlarge at this time.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 16, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the Secretary\r\nof State, containing the information called for by their resolution of\r\nthe 1st of this month, touching the capture and detention of American\r\nfishermen during the last season.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 17, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House a report from the Secretary of State,\r\nwith copies of the correspondence with the Government of France,\r\nrequested by the resolution of the House of the 25th of January last.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 17, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI invite the attention of Congress to the peculiar situation of this\r\nDistrict in regard to the exposure of its inhabitants to contagious\r\ndiseases from abroad, against which it is thought that adequate\r\nprovision should now be made. The exposure being common to the whole\r\nDistrict, the regulation should apply to the whole, to make which\r\nCongress alone possesses the adequate power. That the regulation should\r\nbe made by Congress is the more necessary from the consideration that\r\nthis being the seat of the Government, its protection against such\r\ndiseases must form one of its principal objects.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, with a report\r\nto him from the Third Auditor, of the settlement in the amount stated\r\nof the claims of the State of Massachusetts for services rendered by\r\nthe militia of that State in the late war, the payment of which has\r\nhitherto been prevented by causes which are well known to Congress.\r\nHaving communicated my sentiments on this subject fully in a message\r\nbearing date on the 23d of February, 1824, it is unnecessary to repeat\r\nin detail here what I there advanced. By recurring to that message and\r\nto the documents referred to in it it will be seen that the conduct of\r\nthe executive of that State in refusing to place the militia thereof at\r\nthat difficult conjuncture under the direction of the Executive of the\r\nUnited States, as it was bound to do by a fair construction of the\r\nConstitution, and as the other States did, is the great cause to which\r\nthe difficulty adverted to is to be ascribed. It will also be seen on a\r\nview of those documents that the executive of the State was warned at\r\nthe time if it persevered in the refusal that the consequences which\r\nhave followed would be inevitable; that the attitude assumed by the\r\nState formed a case which was not contemplated by the existing laws\r\nof the United States relating to militia services; that the payment\r\nof the claims of the State for such services could be provided for by\r\nCongress only and by a special law for the purpose. Having made this\r\ncommunication while acting in the Department of War to the governor\r\nof Massachusetts, with the sanction and under the direction of my\r\nenlightened and virtuous predecessor, it would be improper in any view\r\nwhich may be taken of the subject for me to change the ground then\r\nassumed, to withdraw this great question from the consideration of\r\nCongress, and to act on it myself. Had the Executive been in error,\r\nit is entitled to censure, making a just allowance for the motive which\r\nguided it. If its conduct was correct, the ground then assumed ought\r\nto be maintained by it. It belongs to Congress alone to terminate this\r\ndistressing incident on just principles, with a view to the highest\r\ninterests of our Union.\r\n\r\nFrom the view which I have taken of the subject I am confirmed in the\r\nopinion that Congress should now decide on the claim and allow to the\r\nState such portions thereof as are founded on the principles laid down\r\nin the former message. If those principles are correct, as on great\r\nconsideration I am satisfied they are, it appears to me to be just\r\nin itself and of high importance that the sums which may be due in\r\nconformity therewith should no longer be withheld from the State.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1825_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE PRO TEMPORE:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a convention, signed by the plenipotentiaries\r\nof the United States and of the Republic of Colombia at Bogota on the\r\n10th of December, 1824, together with the documents appertaining to the\r\nnegotiation of the same, for the constitutional consideration of the\r\nSenate with regard to its ratification,\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1825_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE PRO TEMPORE:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a convention of general peace, amity,\r\nnavigation, and commerce, signed by the plenipotentiaries of the United\r\nStates and of the Republic of Colombia at Bogota on the 3d of October,\r\n1824, together with the documents appertaining to the negotiation of the\r\nsame, for the constitutional consideration of the Senate with regard to\r\nits ratification.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the House of Representatives a further report from the\r\nSecretary of State, in pursuance of their resolution of the 1st instant,\r\nwith the papers to which it refers, upon the subject of the capture and\r\ndetention of American fishermen the past season in the Bay of Fundy.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 25, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith to both Houses of Congress copies of the treaties\r\nbetween the United States and the Quapaw Nation of Indians, concluded at\r\nHarringtons, in the Territory of Arkansas, on the 15th day of November\r\nlast, and between the United States and the Choctaw Nation of Indians,\r\nconcluded at the city of Washington on the 20th day of January last,\r\nwhich have been duly ratified.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 26, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nJust before the termination of the last session an act entitled \"An\r\nact concerning wrecks on the coast of Florida,\" which then passed,\r\nwas presented to me with many others and approved, and, as I thought,\r\nsigned. A report to that effect was then made to Congress. It appeared,\r\nhowever, after the adjournment that the evidence of such approbation\r\nhad not been attached to it. Whether the act may be considered in\r\nforce under such circumstances is a point on which it belongs not\r\nto me to decide. To remove all doubt on the subject, I submit to the\r\nconsideration of Congress the propriety of passing a declaratory act\r\nto that effect.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 28, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for the exercise of its constitutional power,\r\na treaty lately concluded at the Indian Springs, by commissioners of\r\nthe United States duly authorized, with the chiefs of the Creek Nation,\r\nassembled there in council, with the documents connected therewith.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Senate Journal, Eighteenth Congress, second session, p. 269.]\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 19, 1825_.\r\n\r\n_The President of the United States to ------, Senator for the State\r\nof ------_:\r\n\r\nCertain matters touching the public good requiring that the Senate of\r\nthe United States should be convened on Friday, the 4th day of March\r\nnext, you are desired to attend at the Senate Chamber, in the city of\r\nWashington, on that day, then and there to receive and deliberate on\r\nsuch communications as shall be made to you.\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE.",
