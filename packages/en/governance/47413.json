For, as in generall the great actions of\r\nKings are done as vpon a stage, obuious to the publike gazing of euery\r\nman; so are Wee most willing, that the trueth of this particular,\r\nconcerning Our owne honour, and the satisfaction of Our Subjects,\r\nshould bee represented vnto all men without vaile or couering, being\r\nassured that the most plainnesse and freedome will most aduantage Vs,\r\nhauing in this, and all Our Actions euer affected such sinceritie and\r\nvprightnes of heart, as were Wee all transparent, and that men might\r\nreadily passe to Our inward thoughts, they should there perceiue the\r\nselfe–same affections which Wee haue euer professed in Our outward\r\nwords and Actions.\r\n\r\nHauing anticipated the time of reassembling Our Parliament to the\r\ntwentieth day of _Nouember_ last, (which Wee formerly appointed to\r\nhaue met vpon the eighth of _February_ next,) vpon the confidence\r\nthat their noble and generous declaration at their parting the fourth\r\nof _Iune_ put vs in, of their free and liberall assistance to the\r\nrecouery of Our Childrens ancient inheritance, and hauing declared to\r\nthem Our resolution of taking vpon Vs the defence of Our childrens\r\npatrimonie by way of Armes, the Commons very heartily and dutifully\r\nfell immediatly after their reassembling, to treat of a necessary\r\nsupplie, and concluded, for the present, to grant a Subsidie to be paid\r\nin _February_ next, (the last paiment of the latter Subsidie granted\r\nby them being not to come in vntill _May_ following) whereby Wee were\r\nwell and cleerly satisfied of the good intenti[=o] of the Commons in\r\ngenerall, by whose vniforme vote & assent that Subsidy was resolued\r\non, not without intimation of a more ample supplie to be yeelded in\r\nconuenient time.\r\n\r\nBut before this their resolution was reduced into a formall Acte or\r\nBill, some discontented persons that were the cause of all that euill\r\nwhich succeeded, endeauouring to clog the good will of the Commons with\r\ntheir owne vnreasonable ends, fell to dispute in the House of Our high\r\nPrerogatiues, namely of the match of Our dearest sonne the Prince, of\r\nthe making warre with forreigne Princes Our Allies, betweene whom and\r\nVs there was a firme peace religiously made and obserued hitherunto:\r\nAll which they couered with the cloake of Religion, and with the\r\nfaire pretence of a duetifull Petition to bee preferred to Vs. Wee\r\nvnderstanding right well, that those points were not disputable in\r\nParliament, without Our owne Royall direction, being of Our highest\r\nPrerogatiues, the very Characters of Souereignty; & thinking, that\r\nwhen euery Subiect by nature, and the Lawes of the Realme, had the\r\npower of matching their children according to their owne best liking,\r\nnone should denie Vs the like; especially Wee hauing at the beginning\r\nof the Parliament declared Our purpose concerning the matching of Our\r\nSonne, the Prince, were fully perswaded, that those specious outsides\r\nof Religion and humble petitioning, were added onely to gaine passage\r\nvnto those things, which being propounded in their true colours, must\r\nneeds haue appeared vniust and vnreasonable, as matters wherewith\r\nneuer any Parliament had presumed to meddle before, except they had\r\nbene thereunto required by their King; nay, not befitting Our Priuie\r\nCouncell to meddle with, without Our speciall command and allowance;\r\nsince the very consulting vpon such matters (though in neuer so priuate\r\na maner) being discouered abroad, might at some time produce as ill\r\neffects, as if they were publikely resolued vpon. For as concerning the\r\npoint of Religion, We aswell in the beginning of the Parliament, by a\r\npublike and open Declaration made to both Houses in the higher House of\r\nParliament, as also shortly after, by a gracious answere vnto a former\r\nPetition of theirs, expressed to the full Our immutable resolution to\r\nmaintaine true Religion, besides the vntainted practise of Our whole\r\nlife in that point. And howsoeuer an humble Petition beare a faire shew\r\nof respect; yet if vnder colour of concluding on a Petition, a way\r\nshould bee opened to treat in Parliament of the mysteries of State,\r\nwithout Our Royall allowance, it were a great and vnusuall breach vpon\r\nthe Royall power: Besides, who knoweth not that the preferring of a\r\nPetition, includes an expectation to haue it graunted? and therefore to\r\nnippe this springing euill in the beginning, Wee directed Our Letters\r\nto the Speaker of that House, the tenour of which Letters followeth.\r\n\r\nMaster Speaker, _Wee haue heard by diuers reports to Our great griefe,\r\nThat the farre distance of Our Person at this time from Our high\r\nCourt of Parliament, caused by Our want of health, hath emboldened\r\nsome fiery and popular spirits in Our House of Commons, to debate and\r\nargue publikely, in matters farre beyond their reach or capacitie,\r\nand so tending to Our high dishonour, and to the trenching vpon Our\r\nPrerogatiue Royall. You shall therefore acquaint that House with Our\r\nPleasure, That none therein shall henceforth presume to meddle with any\r\nthing concerning Our gouernment, or mysteries of State; namely, not\r\nto speake of Our dearest Sonnes match with the Daughter of_ Spaine,\r\n_nor to touch the Honour of that King, or any other Our friends or\r\nConfederates: And also not to meddle with any mens particulars, which\r\nhaue their due motion in Our ordinarie Courts of Justice. And whereas\r\nWe heare that they haue sent a message to_ S^[ir] Edwin Sandys, _to\r\nknow the reasons of his late restraint, you shall in Our name resolue\r\nthem, That it was not for any misdemeanour of his in Parliament: But\r\nto put them out of doubt of any question of that nature that may arise\r\namong them hereafter, you shall resolue them in Our name, That We\r\nthinke our Selfe very free and able to punish any mans misdemeanours\r\nin Parliament, as well during their sitting, as after; which We\r\nmeane not to spare hereafter, vpon any occasion of any mans insolent\r\nbehauiour there, that shall be ministred vnto Us. And if they haue\r\nalready touched any of these points which Wee haue here forbidden, in\r\nany Petition of theirs which is to be sent vnto Vs, it is Our pleasure\r\nthat you shall tell them, That except they reforme it before it come\r\nto Our hands, Wee will not deigne the hearing nor answering of it. And\r\nwhereas Wee heare that they are desirous, that We should make this a\r\nSeßion of Parliament before Christmas, You may tell them, It shall be\r\nin their default if they want it: For if they will make ready betweene\r\nthis and that time, some such Lawes as shall be really good for the\r\nCommon–wealth, Wee will very willingly giue Our Royall assent vnto\r\nthem: And so it shall thereby appeare, That if good Lawes be not made\r\nat this time for the weale of the people, the blame shall onely and\r\nmost iustly lie vpon such turbulent spirits, as shall preferre their\r\nparticular ends to the weale of this Kingdome and Common–wealth. And so\r\nWe bid you farewell. Giuen at Our Court at Newmarket, the third day of\r\nDecember, 1621._\r\n\r\n  To Our trustie and welbeloued,\r\n  _The Speaker of Our Commons_\r\n  House of Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhich Letters being publikely read in the House, they were so farre\r\neither from reforming their intended Petition, which conteined those\r\npoints by Vs forbidden, or yet from going on cheerefully in propounding\r\nof good Lawes, for which they were called, and to which purpose Wee\r\ngranted them in the end of Our said Letter to the Speaker, to make it\r\na Session before Christmas, whereof Wee vnderstood them to bee very\r\ndesirous, that they resolued to send the same vnto vs together with\r\nanother Petition iustifying the former, notwithstanding Our forbidding\r\nthem in Our said Letter to send the former Petition vnto Vs, as also\r\nsate euer silent thereafter, till they were dissolued, as shall\r\nhereafter more largely be expressed.\r\n\r\nThose petitions being sent from the Commons by a select number of that\r\nHouse vnto Vs then being at _Newmarket_ for Our health, the House\r\nforbare to proceed in any businesse of importance, purposing, as\r\nwas apparently discerned, and as the euent prooued, so to continue\r\nvntill the returne of their Messengers with Our Answere, which wee\r\nvnderstanding, and being desirous to haue the time better husbanded, as\r\nwas fit (the shortnesse thereof, by reason of the approach of Christmas\r\nbeing respected) required Our Secretarie to deliuer a Message vnto them\r\nfor this purpose, which he did, first by word of mouth, and after by\r\nappointment of the House set it downe in writing in these words, viz.\r\n\r\n_His Majestie, remembring that this House was desirous to haue a Seßion\r\nbetweene this and Christmasse, whereupon it pleased Him to signifie\r\nvnto vs, that wee should haue contentment therein, and that there\r\nshould be a Seßion, if wee our selues were not in fault, taking now\r\nnotice that the House forbeares to proceede with any Billes vntill\r\nthe returne of the Messengers, lately sent vnto his Majestie, hath\r\nenioyned mee to commaund the House in his Name not to lose time in\r\ntheir proceeding for preparing of good Lawes in the meane while, in\r\nconsideration of this so neere approach of Christmaße; And that his\r\nMajestie hopes they will not take vpon them to make a Recesse in\r\neffect, though not in shew without his warrant._\r\n\r\nBvt this Message being deliuered, was so farre from working that good\r\neffect, which Wee did most iustly expect, that contrariwise some\r\ncaptious and curious heads tooke exception thereat, as tending to the\r\nbreach of their Priuiledges, by commanding them to proceede with Bills,\r\nthough We thereby, neither designed any particular Billes for them to\r\nproceed with, nor yet forbade any other Parliamentary proceedings; And\r\nwith those, and such other vndutifull straines of wit, they spunne out\r\nthe time vntill the returne of their Messengers, who being come to\r\n_Newmarket_, presented both the Petitions vnto vs, who well knowing\r\nbefore hand the effect of the former, and then obseruing the contents\r\nof the latter, and finding, that from both did reflect vpon Our Person\r\nand gouernment sundry causelesse aspersions, and that thereby Our\r\nRoyall Prerogatiues were inuaded and assailed, after an admonition to\r\nbeware of medling therewith, Wee returned vnto them Our Answere in\r\nwriting, as followeth.\r\n\r\n  HIS MAJESTIES ANSWERE\r\n  to the Apologetike\r\n  Petition of the House of\r\n  COMMONS,\r\n  _Presented to his Majesty by a dozen_\r\n  of the Members of that House,\r\n  _by their directions_.\r\n\r\n_We must heere begin in the same fashion that We would haue done if\r\nyour first Petition had come to Our hands before We had made stay\r\nthereof, which is to repeat the first words of the late_ Queene _of\r\nfamous memory, vsed by her in Answer to an insolent proposition, made\r\nby a_ Polonian _Ambassadour vnto her, That is_, Legatum expectabamus,\r\nHeraldum accepimus. _For We had great reason to expect that the first\r\nMeßage from your House should haue beene a Message of thankesgiuing\r\nfor Our continued gracious behauior towards Our people since your\r\nlast Recesse, not onely by Our Proclamation of grace, wherein were\r\nconteined sixe or seuen and thirty Articles, all of seuerall points\r\nof grace to the people; but also by the labour We tooke for the\r\nsatisfaction of both Houses in those three Articles recommended vnto\r\nVs in both their names by the right Reuerend Father in God, the\r\nArchbishop of_ Canterbury, _And likewise for the good gouernement of_\r\nIreland _We are now in hand with at your request. But not onely haue\r\nWee heard no newes of all this, but contrary great complaints of the\r\ndanger of Religion within this Kingdome tacitely implying Our ill\r\ngouernment in this point. And We leaue to you to iudge, whether it\r\nbe your duties that are the Representatiue body of Our people, so to\r\ndistast them with Our gouernment, whereas by the contrary it is your\r\nduty with all your endeauours to kindle more and more a dutifull and\r\nthankefull loue in the peoples hearts towards Vs for Our iust and\r\ngracious gouernment. Now, whereas in the very beginning of this your\r\nApologie, you taxe Vs in faire termes of trusting vncertaine reports,\r\nand partiall informations concerning your proceedings, We wish you to\r\nremember, that We are an old and experienced King, needing no such\r\nleßons, being in Our conscience freest of any King aliue from hearing\r\nor trusting idle reports, which so many of your House as are neerest Vs\r\ncan beare witnesse vnto you, if you would giue as good eare to them,\r\nas you doe to some Tribunitiall Orators amongst you. And for proofe\r\nin this particular, Wee haue made your owne Meßengers conferre your\r\nother Petition, sent by you with the copie thereof, which was sent Vs\r\nbefore, betweene which there is no difference at all, but that since\r\nOur receiuing the first Copy you added a conclusion vnto it, which\r\ncould not come to Our hands till it was done by you, and your Meßengers\r\nsent, which was all at one time. And if that We had had no Copie of\r\nit before hand, We must haue receiued your first Petition to Our\r\ngreat dishonour, before Wee had knowen what it conteined, which would\r\nhaue enforced Vs to haue returned you a farre worse answer then now\r\nWe doe. For then your Meßengers had returned with nothing; but that\r\nWee haue iudged your petition vnlawfull and vnworthy of an Answere.\r\nFor as to your Conclusion thereof, it is nothing, but_ Protestatio\r\ncontraria facto. _For in the body of your petition you vsurpe vpon Our\r\nPrerogatiue Royall, and meddle with things farre aboue your reach:\r\nAnd then in the conclusion you protest the contrary, as if a Robber\r\nwould take a mans purse, and then protest he meant not to rob him.\r\nFor first, you presume to giue Vs your aduice concerning the match\r\nof Our dearest Son with some Protestant, We cannot say Princeße (for\r\nWee know none of these fit for him,) and disswade Vs from his match\r\nwith_ Spaine, _vrging Vs to a present warre with that King: And yet\r\nin the conclusion, forsooth, ye protest ye intend not to preße vpon\r\nOur most vndoubted and regall Prerogatiue as if the Petitioning of\r\nVs in matters that your selues confeße yee ought not to meddle with,\r\nwere not a medling with them. And whereas yee pretend, that you were\r\ninuited to this course by the speeches of three Honourable Lords;\r\nYet by so much as your selues repeat of their speeches, nothing can\r\nbee concluded, but that Wee were resolued by warre to regaine the_\r\nPalatinate, _if otherwise VVee could not attaine vnto it; and you were\r\ninuited to aduise forthwith vpon a supplie for keeping the forces in\r\nthe_ Palatinate _from disbanding, and to foresee the meanes for the\r\nraysing and maintaining of the body of an Armie for that warre against\r\nthe Spring. Now what inference can be made vpon this, That therefore\r\nVVe must presently denounce warre against the King of_ Spaine, _breake\r\nOur dearest Sonnes match, and match him to one of Our Religion, let\r\nthe world iudge. The difference is no greater, then as if We would\r\ntell a Merchant, that Wee had great neede to borrow money from him\r\nfor raysing an Armie, that thereupon it should follow, that VVe were\r\nbound to follow his aduice in the directions of the warre, and all\r\nthings depending thereupon. But yet not contenting your selues with\r\nthis excuse of yours, which indeed cannot hold water, ye come after\r\nto a direct contradiction to the conclusion of your former Petition,\r\nsaying, That the Honour and safety of Vs and Our Posterity, and the_\r\nPatrimony _of Our Children, inuaded and poßessed by their enemies,\r\nthe welfare of Religion, and State of Our Kingdome are matter at any\r\ntime not vnfit for your deepest considerations in Parliament. To this\r\ngenerality We answere with the_ Logicians, _That where all things\r\nare contained, nothing is omitted. So as this plenipotencie of yours\r\ninuests you in all power vpon Earth, lacking nothing but the Popes\r\nto haue the keyes also both of Heauen and Purgatory. And to this\r\nvast generality of yours, VVe can giue no other answer, for it will\r\ntrouble all the best Lawyers in the House to make a good Commentary\r\nvpon it: For so did the Puritan Ministers in Scotland bring all kinde\r\nof causes within the compasse of their iurisdiction, saying, That\r\nit was the Churches office to iudge of slander, and there could no\r\nkinde of crime or fault bee committed, but there was a slander in it,\r\neither against God, the King, or their Neighbour. And by this meanes\r\nthey hooked in to themselues the cognisance of all causes, or like_\r\nBellarmines _distinction of the Popes power ouer all Kings_, in ordine\r\nad Spiritualia, _whereby he giues him all temporall iurisdiction ouer\r\nthem. But to giue you a direct Answer to the matter of warre, for which\r\nyou are so earnest, VVe confeße VVee rather expected that you should\r\nhaue giuen Vs great and hartie thanks for the so long maintaining a\r\nsetled peace in all Our Dominions, when as all Our Neighbours about\r\nare in a miserable combustion of warre; but_ Dulce bellum inexpertis;\r\n_and We indeed find by experience, that a number of Our Subiects are so\r\npampered with peace, as they are desirous of change, though they know\r\nnot what. It is true that We haue euer professed, and in that minde,\r\nwith Gods grace, Wee meane to liue and die, That We will labour by all\r\nmeanes poßible, either by treaty, or by force to restore Our Children\r\nto their ancient Dignities and Inheritances; and whatsoeuer Christian\r\nPrinces or Potentates will set themselues against it, Wee will not\r\nspare any lawfull meanes to bring Our so iust and Honourable purpose to\r\na good end; neither shall the Match of Our Sonne, or any other worldly\r\nrespect be preferred to this Our Resolution: For by Our credit, and\r\ninteruention with the King of Spaine, and the Arch–dutcheße, and her\r\nHusband now with God, Wee preserued the lower_ Palatinat _one whole\r\nyeere from any further conquering in it, which within any eight dayes\r\nspace in that time might haue easily been swallowed vp by_ Spinolaes\r\n_Armie, without any resistance; and in no better case was it now, at\r\nOur Ambassadour, the Lord_ Digbies _comming through_ Heydleberg, _if\r\nhe had not extraordinarily succoured it. But because Wee perceiue that\r\nye couple this warre of the_ Palatinate _with the cause of Religion,\r\nWe must a little vnfold your eyes herein. The beginning of this\r\nmiserable warre, which hath set all Christendome on fire, was not for\r\nReligion; but onely caused by Our Sonne in law his hastie and rash\r\nResolution, following euill counsell, to take to himselfe the Crowne\r\nof_ Bohemia: _And that this is true, himselfe wrote Letters vnto Vs\r\nat that time, desiring Vs to giue aßurance, both to the French King,\r\nand State of_ Venice, _that his accepting of the Crowne of_ Bohemia\r\n_had no reference to the cause of Religion, but onely by reason of\r\nhis right by Election (as hee called it:) And we would be sorrie that\r\nthat aspersion should come vpon Our Religion, as to make it a good\r\npretext for dethroning of Kings, and vsurping their Crownes. And Wee\r\nwould bee loath that Our people here should be taught that doctrine:\r\nNo, let vs not so farre wrong the Iesuits, as to rob them of their\r\nsweet Positions and practise in that point. And vpon the other part, We\r\naßure Our selfe so farre of your charitable thoughts of Vs, that Wee\r\nwould neuer haue constantly denyed Our Sonne in law, both the title and\r\naßistance in that point, if Wee had beene well perswaded of the iustice\r\nof his quarrell. But to conclude this point, This vniust vsurpation\r\nof the Crownes of_ Bohemia _and_ Hungaria _from the Emperour, hath\r\ngiuen the Pope, and all that partie, too faire a ground, and opened\r\nthem too wide a gate for the curbing and oppreßing of many thousands\r\nof Our Religion, in diuers parts of Christendome. And whereas yee\r\nexcuse your touching vpon the King of_ Spaine _vpon the occasion of\r\nthe incidents by you repeated in that place, and yet affirme that it\r\nis without any touch to his honor, We cannot wonder ynough, that ye\r\nare so forgetfull, both of your words and writs. For in your former\r\nPetition ye plainely affirme, that hee affects the Temporall Monarchie\r\nof the whole earth, then which there can be no more malice vttered\r\nagainst any great King, to make all other Princes and Potentates,\r\nboth enuie and hate him. But, if ye list, it may be easily tryed,\r\nwhether that speech touched him in honour or not, if We shall aske\r\nhim the question, whether hee meanes to aßume to himselfe that title\r\nor no; For euery King can best iudge of his owne honour. Wee omit the\r\nparticular eiaculations of some foule mouthed Orators in your House,\r\nagainst the honour of his Crowne and State. And touching your excuse of\r\nnot determining any thing concerning the Match of Our dearest Sonne,\r\nbut onely to tell your opinions, and lay it downe at Our feet; First,\r\nWe desire to know how you could haue presumed to determine in that\r\npoint, without committing of high Treason. And next, you cannot deny,\r\nbut your talking of his Match after that manner was a direct breach\r\nof Our commandement & Declaration out of Our own mouth, at the first\r\nsitting downe of this Parliament; where We plainely professed, that\r\nWe were in treatie of his Match with_ Spaine, _and wished you to haue\r\nthat confidence in Our Religion and Wisedome, that We would so manage\r\nit, as our Religion should receiue no preiudice by it. And the same We\r\nnow repeat vnto you, professing, that We are so farre ingaged in that\r\nMatch, as We cannot in honour goe backe, except the King of_ Spaine\r\n_performe not such things as We expect at his hands. And therefore We\r\nare sorrie, that ye should shew to haue so great distrust in Vs, or to\r\nconceiue that We should be cold in our Religion: Otherwise We cannot\r\nimagine how Our former publike Declaration should not haue stopped\r\nyour mouthes in this point. And as to your request, that We would now\r\nreceiue your former Petition, We wonder what could make you presume\r\nthat Wee would now receiue it; whereas in Our former Letter We plainely\r\ndeclared the contrarie vnto you; and therefore Wee haue iustly reiected\r\nthat suit of yours: For what haue you left vnattempted in the highest\r\npoints of Soueraigntie in that Petition of yours, except the striking\r\nof Coine; For it containes the violation of Leagues, the particular\r\nway how to gouerne a warre, and the Marriage of Our dearest Sonne,\r\nboth negatiue with_ Spaine, _nay with any other Popish Princesse; and\r\nalso affirmatiue, as to the matching with one of Our Religion, which\r\nWee confesse is a straine beyond any prouidence or wisedome God hath\r\ngiuen Vs, as things now stand. These are vnfit things to be handled\r\nin Parliament, except your King should require it of you; For who can\r\nhaue wisedome to iudge of things of that nature, but such as are daily\r\nacquainted with the particulars of Treaties, and of the variable or\r\nfixed connexion of affaires of State, together with the knowledge of\r\nthe secret wayes, ends, and intentions of Princes in their seuerall\r\nnegotiations; otherwise a small mistaking in matters of this nature,\r\nmay produce more effects then can be imagined: And therefore_, Ne sutor\r\nvltra crepidam. _And besides, the intermedling in Parliament with\r\nmatters of Peace or Warre, and Marriage of Our dearest Sonne, would\r\nbe such a diminution to Vs and to Our Crowne in forreine Countreys,\r\nas would make any Prince neglect to treat with Vs, either in matters\r\nof Peace or Marriage, except they might be assured by the assent of\r\nParliament. And so it prooued long agoe with a King of_ France, _who\r\nvpon a tricke procuring his States to dissent from some treaty, which\r\nbefore he had made, was after refused treating with by other Princes,\r\nto his great reproach, vnlesse hee Would first procure the assent of\r\nthe three Estates to their proposition. And will you cast your eyes\r\nvpon the late times, you shall finde, that the late Queene of famous\r\nmemorie was humbly petitioned by a Parliament to be pleased to Marrie;\r\nBut her answere was, That shee liked their Petition well, because it\r\nwas simple, not limiting her to place or person, as not befitting her\r\nliking to their fancies; and if they had done otherwise, shee would\r\nhaue thought it a high presumption in them. Iudge then what Wee may doe\r\nin such a case, hauing made Our publique Declaration alreadie, as VVee\r\nsaid before, directly contrary to that which you haue now petitioned.\r\nNow to those points in your Petition, whereof you desire an answere,\r\nas properly belonging to a Parliament; The first and greatest point is\r\nthat of Religion, concerning which at this time Wee can giue you no\r\nother answere then in the generall, which is, That you may rest secure,\r\nthat Wee will neuer be wearie to doe all Wee can for the propagation\r\nof Our Religion, and repreßing of Poperie; but the maner and forme you\r\nmust remit to Our care and prouidence, who can best consider of times\r\nand seasons, not by vndertakng a publique warre of Religion through\r\nall the world at once, which how hard and dangerous a taske it would\r\nprooue, you may iudge. But this puts vs in mind, how all the world\r\ncomplained the last yeere of plentie of Corne, and God hath sent vs a\r\ncooling card this yeere for that heat; And so We pray God, that this\r\ndesire amongst you of kindling warres, shewing your wearinesse of Peace\r\nand Plentie, may not make God permit vs to fall in the miseries of\r\nboth. But as Wee alreadie said, Our care of Religion must be such, as\r\non the one part We must not by the hote prosecution of Our Recusants\r\nat home irritate forreine Princes of contrary Religion, and teach them\r\nthe way to plague the Protestants in their Dominions, whom with Wee\r\ndaily intercede, and at this time principally, for ease to them of\r\nOur profeßion that liue vnder them; yet vpon the other part, We neuer\r\nmeane to spare from due and seuere punishment any Papist that will grow\r\ninsolent for liuing vnder Our so milde Gouernment. And you may also be\r\nassured, We will leaue no care vntaken, as well for the good education\r\nof the youth at home, especially the children of Papists, as also for\r\npreseruing at all times hereafter the youth that are, or shall be\r\nabroad, from being bred in dangerous places, and so poisoned in Popish\r\nSeminaries. And as in this point, namely concerning the good education\r\nof the Popish youth at home, We haue alreadie giuen some good proofe,\r\nboth in this Kingdome and in_ Ireland: _So will We be well pleased to\r\npasse any good Lawes that shall be made, either now, or at any time\r\nhereafter to this purpose. And as to your request, of making this a\r\nSeßion, and granting a generall Pardon, it shall be in your defaults if\r\nWee make not this a Seßion before Christmas, as in Our former Letter\r\nWe notified vnto you. But for the Pardon, yee craue such particulars\r\nin it as Wee must be well aduised vpon, lest otherwise Wee giue you\r\nbacke the double or triple of that Wee are to receiue by your entire\r\nSubsidie without Fifteens. But the ordinarie course Wee hold fittest\r\nto bee vsed still in this case, which is, that Wee should of Our free\r\ngrace send you downe a Pardon from the Higher House, containing such\r\npoints as We shall thinke fittest, wherein We hope ye shall receiue\r\ngood satisfaction. But We cannot omit to shew you how strange We thinke\r\nit, that ye should make so bad and vniust a Commentarie vpon some\r\nwords of Our former Letter, as if We meant to restraine you thereby\r\nof your ancient priuiledges and liberties in Parliament. Truly a\r\nscholler would bee ashamed so to misplace and misiudge any sentences\r\nin another mans booke. For whereas in the fore–end of Our former\r\nLetter We discharge you to meddle with matters of gouernment, or\r\nmysteries of State, namely matters of Warre or Peace, or Our dearest\r\nSonnes Match with_ Spaine; _by which particular denominations We\r\ninterpret and restraine Our former words; and then towards the end\r\nof Our Letter We forbid you to meddle with such things as haue their\r\nordinarie course in Courts of Justice: Yee couple together those two\r\nsentences, lying farre asunder, and plainly leaue out these words, of\r\nmysteries of State; So as ye erre_ à bene diuisis ad male coniuncta.\r\n_For of the former part, concerning mysteries of State, Wee plainelie\r\nrestrained Our meaning to the particulars that were after mentioned:\r\nand in the latter We confeße We meant it by_ S^[ir] Edward Cokes\r\n_foolish busineße, because these heades he is accused of were before\r\nyour meeting presented vnto Vs, and We had setled a legall course of\r\nproceeding therein. And therefore it had well become him, especiallie\r\nbeing Our Seruant, and one of Our Councell, if hee had had any thing\r\nagainst it, to haue complained vnto Vs, which he neuer did, though he\r\nwas ordinarilie at Our Court, since that time, and neuer had acceße\r\nrefused vnto him. And although We cannot allow of the stile, calling it\r\nyour ancient and vndoubted right and inheritance, but could rather haue\r\nwished, that ye had said that your priuiledges were deriued from the\r\ngrace and permißion of Our Ancestours and Vs; For most of them grow\r\nfrom precedents, which shewes rather a toleration then inheritance.\r\nYet Wee are pleased to giue you Our Royall assurance, That as long as\r\nyou shall continue to containe your selues within the limits of your\r\ndutie and respect to Vs (as Wee aßure Our selfe you will doe) Wee\r\nwill bee as carefull to maintaine and preserue your lawfull liberties\r\nand priuiledges as euer any Our Predeceßours were, nay as to preserue\r\nOur owne Royall Prerogatiue. So as your House shall onelie haue neede\r\nto beware to trench vpon the Prerogatiue of the Crowne, which would\r\nenforce Vs, or any iust King to retrench them of their priuiledges,\r\nthat would pare his Prerogatiue and flowers of the Crowne. But of\r\nthis We hope there shall neuer be cause giuen. And to conclude, since\r\nWee haue now so largely expressed the sinceritie of Our meaning vnto\r\nyou, We require you to goe on cheerefullie, and to vse all conuenient\r\ndiligence for preparing such good Lawes for Vs to paße at this time, as\r\nthe people may see the care, that both Wee and you haue for the good\r\ngouernement of the Kingdome; ending as We did in Our former Letter;\r\nIf there be not a happie Seßion made at this time, it shall bee in\r\nyour default. And aboue all, beware by your waywardneße at this time,\r\nto giue Our Childrens Aduersaries cause to insult vpon them, vpon the\r\nrumour that shall be spred abroad of a distraction betweene Vs and\r\nOur people, wherof ye are the representatiue bodie._ At Our Court at\r\nNewmarket the 11. day of December, 1621.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Answere being giuen at _Newmarket_, on Tuesday, the eighth of\r\n_December_, and returned to the house on Friday, the fourteenth of\r\n_December_, some carping wits that were more inclinable to peruert and\r\nwrest Our words vnto a sence contrary to our meaning, then to doe any\r\ngood office betweene Vs and Our people, began to take exception at some\r\nwords concerning their priuiledges toward the end of Our sayd Answere,\r\nthat thereby their Priuiledges were denied and infringed; And by their\r\nexample others of more moderate and better temper were drawen into some\r\ndoubts and iealousies, which occasioned much discontentment in the\r\nHouse, which comming to Our eares, and being willing to omit nothing\r\non Our part, that might aßure the Commons that Wee meant nothing lesse\r\nthen to violate their Priuiledges, for explanation of Our true intent\r\nin the former, We wrote Our Letters directed to Our Secretary, which\r\nfollowe in these words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Right trusty and Welbeloued Councellour, Wee greet you well. Wee\r\nare sorrie to heare, that, notwithstanding Our reiterated Meßages to\r\nOur House of Commons, for going on in their businesses in regard of\r\nthe shortneße of time, betwixt this and Christmas, and of their owne\r\nearnest desire, that Wee should now conclude a Seßion, by making of\r\ngood and profitable Lawes, they continue to loose time; And now of\r\nlate, vpon Our gracious Answer sent vnto them, haue taken occasion to\r\nmake more delay, in appointing a Committee to morrow, to consider vpon\r\nthe points of Our Answer; and especially concerning that point in it\r\nwhich maketh mention of their priuiledges. Our pleasure therefore is,\r\nthat you shall in Our name tell them, that We are so loath to haue time\r\nmis–spent, which is so pretious a thing, in the well vsing whereof Our\r\npeople may receiue so great a benefit, as We are thus farre contented\r\nto discend from Our Royall dignity, by explaining at this time Our\r\nmeaning in Our sayd Answer, touching that point, That all Our good\r\nSubiects in that House, that intend nothing but Our Honour, and the\r\nweale of the Common–wealth, may cleerely see Our intention. Whereas in\r\nOur sayd Answere We told them, that Wee could not allow of the stile,\r\ncalling it their ancient and vndoubted right and inheritance; but\r\ncould rather haue wished, that they had sayd their priuiledges were\r\nderiued from the grace and permißion of Our Ancestors and Vs: (for\r\nmost of them grow from presidents, which shewes rather a toleration\r\nthen inheritance) the plaine truth is, That Wee cannot with patience\r\nendure Our Subiects to vse such Antimonarchicall words to Vs concerning\r\ntheir Liberties, except they had subioyned, that they were granted\r\nvnto them by the grace and fauour of Our Predecessours. But as for Our\r\nintention herein, God knowes Wee neuer meant to deny them any lawfull\r\nPriuiledges that euer that House enioyed in Our Predecessours times,\r\nas We expected Our said Answere should haue sufficiently cleered them;\r\nneither in Justice what euer they haue vndoubted right vnto; nor in\r\nGrace what euer Our Predeceßours or We haue graciously permitted vnto\r\nthem: And therefore We made that distinction of_ the most part; _For\r\nwhatsoeuer Priuiledges or Liberties they enioy by any Law or Statute,\r\nshall be euer inuiolably preserued by Vs; And Wee hope Our Posteritie\r\nwill imitate Our footsteps therein. And whatsoeuer Priuiledges they\r\nenioy by long Custome, and vncontrolled and lawfull Presidents, Wee\r\nwill likewise be as carefull to preserue them, and transmit the care\r\nthereof to Our Posteritie; neither was it any way in Our minde to\r\nthinke of any particular point wherein Wee meant to disallow of their\r\nLiberties. So as in Iustice We confesse Our selues to be bound to\r\nmaintaine them in their rights; and in Grace We are rather minded to\r\nencrease, then infringe any of them, if they shall so deserue at Our\r\nhands. To end therefore as Wee began, let them goe on cheerefully in\r\ntheir businesses, reiecting the curious wrangling of Lawyers vpon words\r\nand syllables; otherwise (which God forbid) the world shall see how\r\noften and how earnestly Wee haue pressed them to goe on, according to\r\ntheir calling, with those things that are fit to be done for the weale\r\nof Our Crowne and Kingdome; And how many curious shifts haue beene\r\nfrom time to time maliciously found out, to frustrate Vs of Our good\r\npurpose, and hinder them from the performance of that Seruice, which\r\nthey ought to Vs and to Our whole Kingdome; whereof when the Countrey\r\nshall come to be truely enformed, they will giue the Authours thereof\r\nlittle thankes._\r\n\r\n Giuen at Our Court at Royston, the sixteenth day of December, 1621.\r\n\r\n\r\n To Our right trustie and welbeloued Councellor, Sir _George Caluert_,\r\n Knight, one of Our principall Secretaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd finding, that notwithstanding all this care taken by Vs for\r\ntheir satisfaction, & that Our thrice reiterated pressing them to\r\nhusband well the shortnesse of time, in doing good businesse fit for\r\na Parliament, Wee were so farre from preuailing with them, as to\r\nall those three admonitions of Ours, which are here related, First,\r\nby Our message deliuered by Our Secretary; Next, by Our conclusion\r\nof Our Answere to their Petition; And lastly, by the conclusion of\r\nOur explanation sent to Our Secretarie, We neither got answere, nor\r\nobedience; Yet the continuall care Wee had that this meeting should not\r\ndissolue without some fruit for the publike good of Our Subiects, made\r\nVs addresse another Letter to the Speaker in these words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaster Speaker, _Whereas at the humble suit of Our house of Commons\r\nWee condescended to make this meeting a Seßion before Christmas, to\r\nwhich purpose We gaue them time vntill Saturday next, in case they\r\nwould seriously applie themselues to that end; & likewise since, out\r\nof Our Grace, and to take away al mistakings, by Our Letters directed\r\nto Our Secretarie, Wee were pleased so fully and clearely to explane\r\nOur selues in the point of maintaining all lawfull Priuiledges to\r\nOur said House, which since Wee cannot heare hath had the wished\r\neffect, in making them spend this short time in preparing things most\r\nnecessary for a Seßion, Wee haue thought good once more clearely by\r\nthis to impart Our minde vnto them; which is, that in respect of the\r\nexpectation after this so long a meeting in Parliament, as also that\r\nthe generalitie, for the most part, rather iudge things by the outward\r\neffects then enter into the causes of them, Wee haue an earnest desire\r\nto make this a Seßion, to the end that our good and louing Subjects\r\nmay haue some taste, aswell of Our Grace and goodnesse towards them by\r\nour free Pardon, and good Lawes to be passed, as they haue had, both\r\nby the great, and vnusuall examples of Iustice since this meeting, and\r\nthe so many eases and comforts giuen vnto them by Proclamatiō: And\r\ntherfore calling to minde, that the paßing of the Subsidie, an Acte for\r\ncontinuance of Statutes, and the Pardon, are the three most preßing\r\nbusinesses to be effected before the end of the Seßion, Wee wish\r\nthem, that, as Wee haue giuen order for the Pardon to goe on with all\r\nexpedition, so they presently goe in hand with the Acte for continuance\r\nof Statutes. As for the Subsidie, though time presseth much, yet if\r\nthey finde it may not now conueniently be done, we will not make that\r\nany way an impediment to the good which Wee desire our people should\r\nfeele by making this a Seßion. Thus much We thought good to giue them\r\nto vnderstand, and withall to assure them, that if they shall not\r\napplie themselues instantly to prepare the aforesaid things for Our\r\nRoyall Assent against Saturday next, Wee will without expecting any\r\nfurther answere from them, construe by their slackenesse, that they\r\ndesire not a Session; and in such case We must giue a larger time for\r\ntheir returning homeward, to such of both Houses as are to goe into\r\ntheir Countreys to keepe hospitalitie among their neighbours in this\r\ntime of Recesse._\r\n\r\n Giuen at our Court at _Theobalds_, the 17. day of _December_, 1621.\r\n\r\n\r\n To Our trustie and welbeloued, Sir _Thomas Richardson_, Knight, Speaker\r\n of Our Commons House of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd hauing at last (as Wee hoped) by these meanes scattered and\r\ndispersed those mistes and vapours, which had beene thus raised about\r\ntheir Priuiledges, the House hauing resolued on Tuesday, the eighteenth\r\nof _December_, to returne thankes vnto Vs, and therewith an excuse for\r\nnot making a Sessi[=o], and passing Bills, both conteined in a Petition\r\nin writing, and dispatched the same vnto Vs, being by that time come to\r\n_Theobalds_, the tenour whereof followeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n May it please your most Excellent MAIESTIE,\r\n\r\n_We your most loyall and humble Subiects, the Knights, Citizens and\r\nBurgeßes of your Commons House of Parliament, hauing this Morning, to\r\nour great comfort, heard your Maiesties Letter sent to our Speaker,\r\nfull of Grace and Goodneße to vs and all your people, haue thought it\r\nour duetie foorthwith, to returne our most humble and heartie thankes\r\nto your Sacred Maiestie, for so Royall a fauour vouchsafed vnto vs; And\r\nwe doe humbly beseech your Maiestie to be truely informed from vs, that\r\nalthough we haue beene very desirous in our duetie to your Maiestie,\r\nwho called vs to this seruice, and to our Countrey for whom we serue,\r\nto haue some good Lawes now to haue beene paßed; and that there might\r\nhaue beene a Seßion before Christmaße, to which your Maiestie vpon our\r\nhumble Petition, was heretofore Graciously pleased to giue way: yet\r\nentring now into a serious consideration of the nature of those things,\r\nwhich must of neceßitie be prepared for the finishing of a Seßion, and\r\nthe strait of time whereunto we are driuen, by some vnhappy diuersions\r\nwhich haue fallen vpon vs, to our great griefe, wee are enforced once\r\nagaine to fly to your Maiesties Grace and fauour, humbly submitting\r\nour selues to your Royall wisedome, what time will be fittest for our\r\ndeparture, and for our reacceße, to perfect those beginnings which are\r\nin preparation with vs; which time by Gods grace we resolue to spend\r\nwith that diligence and care, as shall giue good satisfaction to your\r\nMaiestie, to our Countrey, and to our owne consciences, that we shall\r\nmake good vse thereof._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Wee accepted graciously, and returned them an answere by their\r\nowne Messengers in these words.\r\n\r\n\r\n_That We were sorrie this could not bee made a Seßion, according to\r\ntheir owne desire expressed in their late Petition preferred vnto Vs,\r\nto which Wee had most willingly aßented; that they knew there was\r\nno fault in Vs, who obseruing the needleße impediments, vpon which\r\nthey tooke occasion to stay their proceedings, had often admonished\r\nthem, not to lose time; first, by Secretary_ Caluert, _and afterwards\r\nby three Sundry Letters and Answers. But since they conceiued the\r\nstraitnesse of time (which they had drawne vpon themselues) was such,\r\nthat it would permit nothing to bee done at this time, Wee had giuen\r\norder to adiourne the Parliament till the eighth of February next,\r\nwhich was the first day Wee had formerly appointed for Our meeting\r\ntogether._\r\n\r\n_Wee were likewise pleased to say, that Wee could not omit to tell\r\nthem, that we expected other thankes from them, then they had sent\r\nVs at this time, namely for Our gracious promises to maintaine their\r\nPriuiledges, as Our owne Soueraigne Prerogatiue: First contained in\r\nOur Answere to their Petition, and afterwards as clearely explaned and\r\nenlarged by Our next Letter to Secretarie_ Caluert, _as Our wits, for\r\ntheir safetie, satisfaction and aduantage, could poßibly deuise; but\r\nof this We heard nothing, being slipt by, and wholly omitted by them._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich message was accordingly deliuered the next morning in the House\r\nof Commons. But while We were busied at _Theobalds_ in receiuing\r\ntheir Petition, and returning this answere agreeable to Our Grace and\r\ngood intention towards them, these mutinous and discontented spirits,\r\nneuer giuing ouer their wicked purpose, began anew to stirre the\r\ncoles of discontentment amongst them; and making them beleeue, that\r\ntheir Priuiledges were yet in danger (upon what ground God knowes,\r\nWee cannot imagine nor guesse) procured a Committee to be made for\r\ntaking their Liberties into consideration; where a Protection was\r\nmade, to whom Wee know not, concerning their Priuiledges, which they\r\npretended to bee violated by Our Letters and messages, and thereupon in\r\nan vnseasonable houre, being sixe of the clocke at night, and a very\r\nthinne House, scarcely comming to the third part of the full number,\r\ncontrary to their owne custome in all matters of weight, they conclude\r\nand enter a Protestation for their Liberties, in such ambiguous and\r\ngenerall words, as might serue for future times to inuade most of\r\nthose Rights and Prerogatiues annexed to Our Imperiall Crowne, as bee\r\nthe very markes and Characters of Monarchie and Souereigntie, and\r\nwhereof Wee found Our Crowne vndoubtedly possessed. For founding the\r\nclaime of their Priuiledges vpon the words of Our Writt for assembling\r\na Parliament, the contriuers of that Protestation craftily mentioned\r\nsome words, _viz._ _Super arduis Regni negotijs_, but of purpose left\r\nout _quibusdam_, which restraines that generalitie to such particular\r\nCases, as Wee are to consult with them vpon. And the very vncontrolled\r\nCustome of all times doeth manifestly prooue, that the King Himselfe,\r\nor His Chancellour in his name, doeth at the very beginning of the\r\nParliament declare vnto them what things these _quibusdam_ are, wherein\r\nhee craueth their aduice and assistance; And vse is euer the best\r\ninterpreter of words in a case of this nature: Vpon which vnduetifull\r\nProtestation Wee were iustly occasioned to publish Our pleasure for\r\ndissolution of the Parliament, as appeares by Our Proclamation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  Imprinted at London by BONHAM NORTON and IOHN BILL, Printers to the\r\n               Kings most Excellent Maiestie.
