While thus striving to be accurate, fair,\r\nand just, he has not thought it his duty to mince words, nor to refrain\r\nfrom \"calling things by their right names;\" neither has he sought to\r\ncurry favor, in any quarter, by fulsome adulation on the one side, nor\r\nundue denunciation on the other, either of the living, or of the dead.\r\nBut, while tracing the history of the Great Conspiracy, from its obscure\r\nbirth in the brooding brains of a few ambitious men of the earliest days\r\nof our Republic, through the subsequent years of its devolution, down to\r\nthe evil days of Nullification, and to the bitter and bloody period of\r\narmed Rebellion, or contemplating it in its still more recent and,\r\nperhaps, more sinister development, of to-day, he has conscientiously\r\ndealt with it, throughout, in the clear and penetrating light of the\r\nvoluminous records so readily accessible at the seat of our National\r\nGovernment.  So far as was practicable, he has endeavored to allow the\r\nchief characters in that Conspiracy-as well as the Union leaders, who,\r\nwhether in Executive, Legislative, or Military service, devoted their\r\nbest abilities and energies to its suppression--to speak for themselves,\r\nand thus while securing their own proper places in history, by a process\r\nof self-adjustment as it were, themselves to write down that history in\r\ntheir own language.  If then there be found within these covers aught\r\nwhich may seem harsh to those directly or indirectly, nearly or\r\nremotely, connected with that Conspiracy, he may not unfairly exclaim:\r\n\"Thou canst not say I did it.\"  If he knows his own heart, the writer\r\ncan truly declare, with his hand upon it, that it bears neither hatred,\r\nmalice, nor uncharitableness, to those who, misled by the cunning\r\nsecrecy of the Conspirators, and without an inkling or even a suspicion\r\nof their fell purposes, went manfully into the field, with a courage\r\nworthy of a better cause, and for four years of bloody conflict,\r\nbelieving that their cause was just, fought the armies of the Union, in\r\na mad effort to destroy the best government yet devised by man upon this\r\nplanet.  And, perhaps, none can better understand than he, how hard, how\r\nvery hard, it must be for men of strong nature and intense feeling,\r\nafter taking a mistaken stand, and especially after carrying their\r\nconviction to the cannon's mouth, to acknowledge their error before the\r\nworld.  Hence, while he has endeavored truly to depict--or to let those\r\nwho made history at the time help him to depict--the enormity of the\r\noffence of the armed Rebellion and of the heresies and plottings of\r\ncertain Southern leaders precipitating it, yet not one word will be\r\nfound, herein, condemnatory of those who, with manly candor, soldierly\r\ncourage, and true patriotism, acknowledged that error when the ultimate\r\narbitrament of the sword had decided against them.  On the contrary, to\r\nall such as accept, in good faith, the results of the war of the\r\nRebellion, the writer heartily holds out the hand of forgiveness for the\r\npast, and good fellowship for the future.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.

WIGFALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                       A PRELIMINARY RETROSPECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo properly understand the condition of things preceding the great war\r\nof the Rebellion, and the causes underlying that condition and the war\r\nitself, we must glance backward through the history of the Country to,\r\nand even beyond, that memorable 30th of November, 1782, when the\r\nIndependence of the United States of America was at last conceded by\r\nGreat Britain.  At that time the population of the United States was\r\nabout 2,500,000 free whites and some 500,000 black slaves.  We had\r\ngained our Independence of the Mother Country, but she had left fastened\r\nupon us the curse of Slavery.  Indeed African Slavery had already in\r\n1620 been implanted on the soil of Virginia before Plymouth Rock was\r\npressed by the feet of the Pilgrim Fathers, and had spread, prior to the\r\nRevolution, with greater or less rapidity, according to the surrounding\r\nadaptations of soil, production and climate, to every one of the\r\nthirteen Colonies.\r\n\r\nBut while it had thus spread more or less throughout all the original\r\nColonies, and was, as it were, recognized and acquiesced in by all, as\r\nan existing and established institution, yet there were many, both in\r\nthe South and North, who looked upon it as an evil--an inherited evil\r\n--and were anxious to prevent the increase of that evil.  Hence it was\r\nthat even as far back as 1699, a controversy sprang up between the\r\nColonies and the Home Government, upon the African Slavery question\r\n--a controversy continuing with more or less vehemence down to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence itself.\r\n\r\nIt was this conviction that it was not alone an evil but a dangerous\r\nevil, that induced Jefferson to embody in his original draft of that\r\nDeclaration a clause strongly condemnatory of the African Slave Trade--a\r\nclause afterward omitted from it solely, he tells us, \"in complaisance\r\nto South Carolina and Georgia, who had never* attempted to restrain the\r\nimportation of slaves, and who, on the contrary, still wished to\r\ncontinue it,\" as well as in deference to the sensitiveness of Northern\r\npeople, who, though having few slaves themselves, \"had been pretty\r\nconsiderable carriers of them to others\" a clause of the great\r\nindictment of King George III., which, since it was not omitted for any\r\nother reason than that just given, shows pretty conclusively that where\r\nthe fathers in that Declaration affirmed that \"all men are created\r\nequal,\" they included in the term \"men,\" black as well as white, bond as\r\nwell as free; for the clause ran thus: \"Determined to keep open a market\r\nwhere MEN should be bought and sold, he has prostituted his negative for\r\nsuppressing every Legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this\r\nexecrable commerce.  And that this assemblage of horrors might want no\r\nfact of distinguished dye, he is now exciting those very people to rise\r\nin arms among us, and purchase that liberty of which he has deprived\r\nthem, by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded them; thus paying\r\nof former crimes committed against the LIBERTIES of our people with\r\ncrimes which he urges them to commit against the LIVES of another.\"\r\n\r\n     [Prior to 1752, when Georgia surrendered her charter and became a\r\n     Royal Colony, the holding of slaves within its limits was expressly\r\n     prohibited by law; and the Darien (Ga.) resolutions of 1775\r\n     declared not only a \"disapprobation and abhorrence of the unnatural\r\n     practice of Slavery in America\" as \"a practice founded in injustice\r\n     and cruelty, and highly dangerous to our Liberties (as well as\r\n     lives) but a determination to use our utmost efforts for the\r\n     manumission of our slaves in this colony upon the most safe and\r\n     equitable footing for the masters and themselves.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the war of the Revolution following the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, the half a million of slaves, nearly all of them in the\r\nSouthern States, were found to be not only a source of weakness, but,\r\nthrough the incitements of British emissaries, a standing menace of\r\nperil to the Slaveholders.  Thus it was that the South was overrun by\r\nhostile British armies, while in the North-comparatively free of this\r\nelement of weakness--disaster after disaster met them.  At last,\r\nhowever, in 1782, came the recognition of our Independence, and peace,\r\nfollowed by the evacuation of New York at the close of 1783.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of the war, touching Slavery, had not been lost upon our\r\nstatesmen.  Early in 1784 Virginia ceded to the United States her claims\r\nof jurisdiction and otherwise over the vast territory north-west of the\r\nOhio; and upon its acceptance, Jefferson, as chairman of a Select\r\nCommittee appointed at his instance to consider a plan of government\r\ntherefor, reported to the ninth Continental Congress an Ordinance to\r\ngovern the territory ceded already, or to be ceded, by individual States\r\nto the United States, extending from the 31st to the 47th degree of\r\nnorth latitude, which provided as \"fundamental conditions between the\r\nthirteen original States and those newly described\" as embryo States\r\nthereafter--to be carved out of such territory ceded or to be ceded to\r\nthe United States, not only that \"they shall forever remain a part of\r\nthe United States of America,\" but also that \"after the year 1800 of the\r\nChristian era, there shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude\r\nin any of the said States\"--and that those fundamental conditions were\r\n\"unalterable but by the joint consent of the United States in Congress\r\nassembled, and of the particular State within which such alteration\r\nis proposed to be made.\"\r\n\r\nBut now a signal misfortune befell.  Upon a motion to strike out the\r\nclause prohibiting Slavery, six States: New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania, voted to retain\r\nthe prohibitive clause, while three States, Maryland, Virginia and South\r\nCarolina, voted not to retain it.  The vote of North Carolina was\r\nequally divided; and while one of the Delegates from New Jersey voted to\r\nretain it, yet as there was no other delegate present from that State,\r\nand the Articles of Confederation required the presence of \"two or more\"\r\ndelegates to cast the vote of a State, the vote of New Jersey was lost;\r\nand, as the same Articles required an affirmative vote of a majority of\r\nall the States--and not simply of those present--the retention of the\r\nclause prohibiting Slavery was also lost.  Thus was lost the great\r\nopportunity of restricting Slavery to the then existing Slave States,\r\nand of settling the question peaceably for all time.  Three years\r\nafterward a similar Ordinance, since become famous as \"the Ordinance of\r\n'87,\" for the government of the North-west Territory (from which the\r\nFree States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin have\r\nsince been carved and admitted to the Union) was adopted in Congress by\r\nthe unanimous vote of all the eight States present.  And the sixth\r\narticle of this Ordinance, or \"Articles of Compact,\" which it was\r\nstipulated should \"forever remain unalterable, unless by common\r\nconsent,\" was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Art. 6.  There shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude in\r\nthe said Territory, otherwise than in punishment of crimes, whereof the\r\nparty shall have been duly convicted; provided always that any person\r\nescaping into the same from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in\r\nany one of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed,\r\nand conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor, or service, as\r\naforesaid.\"\r\n\r\nBut this Ordinance of '87, adopted almost simultaneously with the\r\nframing of our present Federal Constitution, was essentially different\r\nfrom the Ordinance of three years previous, in this: that while the\r\nlatter included the territory south of the Ohio River as well as that\r\nnorth-west of it, this did not; and as a direct consequence of this\r\nfailure to include in it the territory south of that river, the States\r\nof Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, which were taken out of it, were\r\nsubsequently admitted to the Union as Slave States, and thus greatly\r\naugmented their political power.  And at a later period it was this\r\nincreased political power that secured the admission of still other\r\nSlave States--as Florida, Louisiana and Texas--which enabled the Slave\r\nStates to hold the balance of such power as against the original States\r\nthat had become Free, and the new Free States of the North-west.\r\n\r\nHence, while in a measure quieting the great question of Slavery for the\r\ntime being, the Ordinance of '87 in reality laid the ground-work for the\r\nlong series of irritations and agitations touching its restrictions and\r\nextension, which eventually culminated in the clash of arms that shook\r\nthe Union from its centre to its circumference.  Meanwhile, as we have\r\nseen--while the Ordinance of 1787 was being enacted in the last Congress\r\nof the old Confederation at New York--the Convention to frame the\r\npresent Constitution was sitting at Philadelphia under the Presidency of\r\nGeorge Washington himself.  The old Confederation had proved itself to\r\nbe \"a rope of sand.\"  A new and stronger form of government had become a\r\nnecessity for National existence.\r\n\r\nTo create it out of the discordant elements whose harmony was essential\r\nto success, was an herculean task, requiring the utmost forbearance,\r\nunselfishness, and wisdom.  And of all the great questions, dividing the\r\nframers of that Constitution, perhaps none of them required a higher\r\ndegree of self abnegation and patriotism than those touching human\r\nSlavery.\r\n\r\nThe situation was one of extreme delicacy.  The necessity for a closer\r\nand stronger Union of all the States was apparently absolute, yet this\r\nvery necessity seemed to place a whip in the hands of a few States, with\r\nwhich to coerce the greater number of States to do their bidding.  It\r\nseemed that the majority must yield to a small minority on even vital\r\nquestions, or lose everything.\r\n\r\nThus it was, that instead of an immediate interdiction of the African\r\nSlave Trade, Congress was empowered to prohibit it after the lapse of\r\ntwenty years; that instead of the basis of Congressional Representation\r\nbeing the total population of each State, and that of direct taxation\r\nthe total property of each State, a middle ground was conceded, which\r\nregarded the Slaves as both persons and property, and the basis both of\r\nRepresentation and of Direct Taxation was fixed as being the total Free\r\npopulation \"plus three-fifths of all other persons\" in each State; and\r\nthat there was inserted in the Constitution a similar clause to that\r\nwhich we have seen was almost simultaneously incorporated in the\r\nOrdinance of '87, touching the reclamation and return to their owners of\r\nFugitive Slaves from the Free States into which they may have escaped.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is, that the Convention that framed our\r\nConstitution lacked the courage of its convictions, and was \"bulldozed\"\r\nby the few extreme Southern Slave-holding States--South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia especially.  It actually paltered with those convictions and\r\nwith the truth itself.  Its convictions--those at least of a great\r\nmajority of its delegates--were against not only the spread, but the\r\nvery existence of Slavery; yet we have seen what they unwillingly agreed\r\nto in spite of those convictions; and they were guilty moreover of the\r\nsubterfuge of using the terms \"persons\" and \"service or labor\" when they\r\nreally meant \"Slaves\" and \"Slavery.\"  \"They did this latter,\" Mr.\r\nMadison says, \"because they did not choose to admit the right of\r\nproperty in man,\" and yet in fixing the basis of Direct Taxation as well\r\nas Congressional Representation at the total Free population of each\r\nState with \"three-fifths of all other persons,\" they did admit the right\r\nof property in man!  As was stated by Mr. Iredell to the North Carolina\r\nRatification Convention, when explaining the Fugitive Slave clause:\r\n\"Though the word 'Slave' is not mentioned, this is the meaning of it.\"\r\nAnd he added: \"The Northern delegates, owing to their peculiar scruples\r\non the subject of Slavery, did not choose the word 'Slave' to be\r\nmentioned.\"\r\n\r\nIn March, 1789, the first Federal Congress met at New York.  It at once\r\nenacted a law in accordance with the terms of the Ordinance of '87\r\n--adapting it to the changed order of things under the new Federal\r\nConstitution--prohibiting Slavery in the Territories of the North-west;\r\nand the succeeding Congress enacted a Fugitive-Slave law.\r\n\r\nIn the same year (1789) North Carolina ceded her western territory (now\r\nTennessee) south of the Ohio, to the United States, providing as one of\r\nthe conditions of that cession, \"that no regulation made, or to be made,\r\nby Congress, shall tend to emancipate Slaves.\"  Georgia, also, in 1802,\r\nceded her superfluous territorial domain (south of the Ohio, and now\r\nknown as Alabama and Mississippi), making as a condition of its\r\nacceptance that the Ordinance of '87 \"shall, in all its parts, extend to\r\nthe territory contained in the present act of cession, the article only\r\nexcepted which forbids Slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThus while the road was open and had been taken advantage of, at the\r\nearliest moment, by the Federal Congress to prohibit Slavery in all the\r\nterritory north-west of the Ohio River by Congressional enactment,\r\nCongress considered itself barred by the very conditions of cession from\r\ninhibiting Slavery in the territory lying south of that river.  Hence it\r\nwas that while the spread of Slavery was prevented in the one Section of\r\nour outlying territories by Congressional legislation, it was stimulated\r\nin the other Section by the enforced absence of such legislation.  As a\r\nnecessary sequence, out of the Territories of the one Section grew more\r\nFree States and out of the other more Slave States, and this condition\r\nof things had a tendency to array the Free and the Slave States in\r\nopposition to each other and to Sectionalize the flames of that Slavery\r\nagitation which were thus continually fed.\r\n\r\nUpon the admission of Ohio to Statehood in 1803, the remainder of the\r\nNorth-west territory became the Territory of Indiana.  The inhabitants\r\nof this Territory (now known as the States of Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMichigan and Wisconsin), consisting largely of settlers from the Slave\r\nStates, but chiefly from Virginia and Kentucky, very persistently (in\r\n1803, 1806 and 1807) petitioned Congress for permission to employ Slave\r\nLabor, but--although their petitions were favorably reported in most\r\ncases by the Committees to which they were referred--without avail,\r\nCongress evidently being of opinion that a temporary suspension in this\r\nrespect of the sixth article of the Ordinance of '87 was \"not\r\nexpedient.\"  These frequent rebuffs by Congress, together with the\r\nconstantly increasing emigration from the Free States, prevented the\r\ntaking of any further steps to implant Slavery on the soil of that\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the vast territory included within the Valley of the\r\nMississippi and known at that day as the \"Colony of Louisiana,\" was, in\r\n1803, acquired to the United States by purchase from the French--to whom\r\nit had but lately been retroceded by Spain.  Both under Spanish and\r\nFrench rule, Slavery had existed throughout this vast yet sparsely\r\npopulated region.  When we acquired it by purchase, it was already\r\nthere, as an established \"institution;\" and the Treaty of acquisition\r\nnot only provided that it should be \"incorporated into the Union of the\r\nUnited States, and admitted as soon as possible, according to the\r\nprinciples of the Federal Constitution,\" but that its inhabitants in the\r\nmeantime \"should be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of\r\ntheir liberty, property, and the religion which they professed\"--and,\r\nas \"the right of property in man\" had really been admitted in practice,\r\nif not in theory, by the framers of that Constitution itself--that\r\ninstitution was allowed to remain there.  Indeed the sparseness of its\r\npopulation at the time of purchase and the amazing fertility of its soil\r\nand adaptability of its climate to Slave Labor, together with the then\r\nrecent invention by Eli Whitney, of Massachusetts, of that wonderful\r\nimprovement in the separation of cotton-fibre from its seed, known as\r\nthe \"cotton-gin\"--which with the almost simultaneous inventions of\r\nHargreaves, and Arkwright's cotton-spinning machines, and Watt's\r\napplication of his steam engine, etc., to them, marvelously increased\r\nboth the cotton supply and demand and completely revolutionized the\r\ncotton industry--contributed to rapidly and thickly populate the whole\r\nregion with white Slave-holders and black Slaves, and to greatly enrich\r\nand increase the power of the former.\r\n\r\nWhen Jefferson succeeded in negotiating the cession of that vast and\r\nrich domain to the United States, it is not to be supposed that either\r\nthe allurements of territorial aggrandizement on the one hand, or the\r\nimpending danger to the continued ascendency of the political party\r\nwhich had elevated him to the Presidency, threatening it from all the\r\nirritations with republican France likely to grow out of such near\r\nproximity to her Colony, on the other, could have blinded his eyes to\r\nthe fact that its acquisition must inevitably tend to the spread of that\r\nvery evil, the contemplation of which, at a later day, wrung from his\r\nlips the prophetic words, \"I tremble for my Country when I reflect that\r\nGod is just.\"  It is more reasonable to suppose that, as he believed the\r\nascendency of the Republican party of that day essential to the\r\nperpetuity of the Republic itself, and revolted against being driven\r\ninto an armed alliance with Monarchical England against what he termed\r\n\"our natural friend,\" Republican France, he reached the conclusion that\r\nthe preservation of his Republican principles was of more immediate\r\nmoment than the question of the perpetuation and increase of human\r\nSlavery.  Be that as it may, it none the less remains a curious fact\r\nthat it was to Jefferson, the far-seeing statesman and hater of African\r\nSlavery and the author of the Ordinance of 1784--which sought to exclude\r\nSlavery from all the Territories of the United States south of, as well\r\nas north-west of the Ohio River--that we also owe the acquisition of the\r\nvast territory of the Mississippi Valley burdened with Slavery in such\r\nshape that only a War, which nearly wrecked our Republic, could get rid\r\nof!\r\n\r\nOut of that vast and fertile, but Slave-ridden old French Colony of\r\n\"Louisiana\" were developed in due time the rich and flourishing Slave\r\nStates of Louisiana, Missouri and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nIt will have been observed that this acquisition of the Colony of\r\nLouisiana and the contemporaneous inventions of the cotton-gin, improved\r\ncotton-spinning machinery, and the application to it of steam power, had\r\nalready completely neutralized the wisdom of the Fathers in securing, as\r\nthey thought, the gradual but certain extinction of Slavery in the\r\nUnited States, by that provision in the Constitution which enabled\r\nCongress, after an interval of twenty years, to prohibit the African\r\nSlave Trade; and which led the Congress, on March 22, 1794, to pass an\r\nAct prohibiting it; to supplement it in 1800 with another Act in the\r\nsame direction; and on March 2, 1807, to pass another supplemental Act\r\n--to take effect January 1, 1808--still more stringent, and covering any\r\nsuch illicit traffic, whether to the United States or with other\r\ncountries.  Never was the adage that, \"The best laid schemes o' mice an'\r\nmen gang aft agley,\" more painfully apparent.  Slaves increased and\r\nmultiplied within the land, and enriched their white owners to such a\r\ndegree that, as the years rolled by, instead of compunctions of\r\nconscience on the subject of African Slavery in America, the Southern\r\nleaders ultimately persuaded themselves to the belief that it was not\r\nonly moral, and sanctioned by Divine Law, but that to perpetuate it was\r\na philanthropic duty, beneficial to both races!  In fact one of them\r\ndeclared it to be \"the highest type of civilization.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1812, the State of Louisiana, organized from the purchased Colony of\r\nthe same name, was admitted to the Union, and the balance of the\r\nLouisiana purchase was thereafter known as the Territory of Missouri.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 commenced the heated and protracted struggle in Congress over\r\nthe admission of the State of Missouri--created from the Territory of\r\nthat name--as a Slave State, which finally culminated in 1820 in the\r\nsettlement known thereafter as the \"Missouri Compromise.\"\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, that struggle may be said to have consisted in the\r\nefforts of the House on the one side, to restrict Slavery in the State\r\nof Missouri, and the efforts of the Senate on the other, to give it free\r\nrein.  The House insisted on a clause in the Act of admission providing,\r\n\"That the introduction of Slavery or involuntary servitude be\r\nprohibited, except for the punishment of crimes whereof the party has\r\nbeen duly convicted; and that all children born within the said State,\r\nafter the admission thereof into the Union, shall be declared Free at\r\nthe age of twenty-five years.\"  The Senate resisted it--and the Bill\r\nfell.  In the meantime, however, a Bill passed both Houses forming the\r\nTerritory of Arkansas out of that portion of the Territory of Missouri\r\nnot included in the proposed State of Missouri, without any such\r\nrestriction upon Slavery.  Subsequently, the House having passed a Bill\r\nto admit the State of Maine to the Union, the Senate amended it by\r\ntacking on a provision authorizing the people of Missouri to organize a\r\nState Government, without restriction as to Slavery.  The House\r\ndecidedly refused to accede to the Senate proposition, and the result of\r\nthe disagreement was a Committee of Conference between the two Houses,\r\nand the celebrated \"Missouri Compromise,\" which, in the language of\r\nanother--[Hon.  John Holmes of Massachusetts, of said Committee on\r\nConference, March 2, 1820.]--, was: \"that the Senate should give up its\r\ncombination of Missouri with Maine; that the House should abandon its\r\nattempt to restrict Slavery in Missouri; and that both Houses should\r\nconcur in passing the Bill to admit Missouri as a State, with\" a\r\n\"restriction or proviso, excluding Slavery from all territory north and\r\nwest of the new State\"--that \"restriction or proviso\" being in these\r\nwords: \"That in all that territory ceded by France to the United States\r\nunder the name of Louisiana, which lies north of thirty-six degrees,\r\nthirty minutes north latitude, excepting only such part thereof as is\r\nincluded within the limits of the State contemplated by this act,\r\nSlavery and involuntary servitude, otherwise than in the punishment of\r\ncrime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall be and is\r\nhereby forever prohibited; Provided always, that any person escaping\r\ninto the same, from whom labor and service is lawfully claimed in any\r\nState or Territory of the United States, such Fugitive may be lawfully\r\nreclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or\r\nservice, as aforesaid.\"  At a subsequent session of Congress, at which\r\nMissouri asked admission as a State with a Constitution prohibiting her\r\nLegislature from passing emancipation laws, or such as would prevent the\r\nimmigration of Slaves, while requiring it to enact such as would\r\nabsolutely prevent the immigration of Free Negroes or Mulattoes, a\r\nfurther Compromise was agreed to by Congress under the inspiration of\r\nMr. Clay, by which it was laid down as a condition precedent to her\r\nadmission as a State--a condition subsequently complied with--that\r\nMissouri must pledge herself that her Legislature should pass no act \"by\r\nwhich any of the citizens of either of the States should be excluded\r\nfrom the enjoyment of the privileges and immunities to which they are\r\nentitled under the Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThis, in a nut-shell, was the memorable Missouri Struggle, and the\r\n\"Compromise\" or Compromises which settled and ended it.  But during that\r\nstruggle--as during the formation of the Federal Constitution and at\r\nvarious times in the interval when exciting questions had arisen--the\r\nbands of National Union were more than once rudely strained, and this\r\ntime to such a degree as even to shake the faith of some of the firmest\r\nbelievers in the perpetuity of that Union.  It was during this bitter\r\nstruggle that John Adams wrote to Jefferson: \"I am sometimes Cassandra\r\nenough to dream that another Hamilton, another Burr, may rend this\r\nmighty fabric in twain, or perhaps into a leash, and a few more choice\r\nspirits of the same stamp might produce as many Nations in North America\r\nas there are in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that we had \"sown the wind,\" but we had not yet \"reaped the\r\nwhirlwind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                       PROTECTION AND FREE TRADE.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the first Federal Congress met at New York in March,\r\n1789.  It organized April 6th.  None knew better than its members that\r\nthe war of the Americana Revolution chiefly grew out of the efforts of\r\nGreat Britain to cripple and destroy our Colonial industries to the\r\nbenefit of the British trader, and that the Independence conquered, was\r\nan Industrial as well as Political Independence; and none knew better\r\nthan they, that the failure of the subsequent political Confederation of\r\nStates was due mainly to its failure to encourage and protect the\r\nbudding domestic manufactures of those States.  Hence they hastened,\r\nunder the leadership of James Madison, to pass \"An Act laying a duty on\r\ngoods, wares and merchandize imported into the United States,\" with a\r\npreamble, declaring it to be \"necessary\" for the \"discharge of the debt\r\nof the United States and the encouragement and protection of\r\nmanufactures.\"  It was approved by President Washington July 4, 1789--a\r\ndate not without its significance--and levied imports both specific and\r\nad valorem.  It was not only our first Tariff Act, but, next to that\r\nprescribing the oath used in organizing the Government, the first Act of\r\nthe first Federal Congress; and was passed in pursuance of the\r\ndeclaration of President Washington in his first Message, that \"The\r\nsafety and interest of the People\" required it.  Under the inspiration\r\nof Alexander Hamilton the Tariff of 1790 was enacted at the second\r\nsession of the same Congress, confirming the previous Act and increasing\r\nsome of the protective duties thereby imposed.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the vote in the House of Representatives on this Tariff\r\nBill discloses the fact that of the 39 votes for it, 21 were from\r\nSouthern States, 13 from the Middle States, and 5 from New England\r\nStates; while of the 13 votes against it, 9 were from New England\r\nStates, 3 from Southern States, and 1 from Middle States.  In other\r\nwords, while the Southern States were for the Bill in the proportion of\r\n21 to 3, and the Middle States by 13 to 1, New England was against it by\r\n9 to 5; or again, while 10 of the 13 votes against it were from the New\r\nEngland and Middle States, 21 (or more than half) of the 39 votes for it\r\nwere from Southern States.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen-singularly enough in view of subsequent events\r\n--that we not only mainly owe our first steps in Protective Tariff\r\nlegislation to the almost solid Southern vote, but that it was thus\r\nsecured for us despite the opposition of New England.  Nor did our\r\nindebtedness to Southern statesmen and Southern votes for the\r\ninstitution of the now fully established American System of Protection\r\ncease here, as we shall presently see.\r\n\r\nThat Jefferson, as well as Washington and Madison, agreed with the views\r\nof Alexander Hamilton on Protection to our domestic manufactures as\r\nagainst those of foreign Nations, is evident in his Annual Message of\r\nDecember 14, 1806, wherein-discussing an anticipated surplus of Federal\r\nrevenue above the expenditures, and enumerating the purposes of\r\neducation and internal improvement to which he thinks the \"whole surplus\r\nof impost\" should during times of peace be applied; by which application\r\nof such surplus he prognosticates that \"new channels of communication\r\nwill be opened between the States; the lines of separation will\r\ndisappear; their interests will be identified, and their Union cemented\r\nby new and indissoluble ties\"--he says: \"Shall we suppress the impost\r\nand give that advantage to foreign over domestic manufactures.  On a few\r\narticles of more general and necessary use, the suppression in due\r\nseason, will doubtless be right; but the great mass of the articles on\r\nwhich impost is paid is foreign luxuries, purchased by those only who\r\nare rich enough to afford themselves the use of them.\"  But his embargo\r\nand other retaliatory measures, put in force in 1807 and 1808, and the\r\nWar of 1812-15 with Great Britain, which closely followed, furnished\r\nProtection in another manner, by shutting the door to foreign imports\r\nand throwing our people upon their own resources, and contributed\r\ngreatly to the encouragement and increase of our home manufactures\r\n--especially those of wool, cotton, and hemp.\r\n\r\nAt the close of that War the traders of Great Britain determined, even\r\nat a temporary loss to themselves, to glut our market with their goods\r\nand thus break down forever, as they hoped, our infant manufactures.\r\nTheir purpose and object were boldly announced in the House of Commons\r\nby Mr. Brougham, when he said: \"Is it worth while to incur a loss upon\r\nthe first importation, in order by the glut to stifle in the cradle\r\nthose rising manufactures in the United States which the War had forced\r\ninto existence contrary to the natural course of things.\"  Against this\r\nthreatened ruin, our manufacturers all over the United States--the sugar\r\nplanters of Louisiana among them--clamored for Protection, and Congress\r\nat once responded with the Tariff Act of 1816.\r\n\r\nThis law greatly extended and increased specific duties on, and\r\ndiminished the application of the ad valorem principle to, foreign\r\nimports; and it has been well described as \"the practical foundation of\r\nthe American policy of encouragement of home manufactures--the practical\r\nestablishment of the great industrial system upon which rests our\r\npresent National wealth, and the power and the prosperity and happiness\r\nof our whole people.\"  While Henry Clay of Kentucky, William Loundes of\r\nSouth Carolina, and Henry St. George Tucker of Virginia supported the\r\nBill most effectively, no man labored harder and did more effective\r\nservice in securing its passage than John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.\r\nThe contention on their part was not for a mere \"incidental protection\"\r\n--much less a \"Tariff for revenue only\"--but for \"Protection\" in its\r\nbroadest sense, and especially the protection of their cotton\r\nmanufactures.  Indeed Calhoun's defense of Protection, from the assaults\r\nof those from New England and elsewhere who assailed it on the narrow\r\nground that it was inimical to commerce and navigation, was a notable\r\none.  He declared that:\r\n\r\n\"It (the encouragement of manufactures) produced a system strictly\r\nAmerican, as much so as agriculture, in which it had the decided\r\nadvantage of commerce and navigation.  The country will from this derive\r\nmuch advantage.  Again it is calculated to bind together more closely\r\nour wide-spread Republic.  It will greatly increase our mutual\r\ndependence and intercourse, and will, as a necessary consequence, excite\r\nan increased attention to internal improvements--a subject every way so\r\nintimately connected with the ultimate attainment of national strength\r\nand the perfection of our political institutions.\"\r\n\r\nHe regarded the fact that it would make the parts adhere more closely;\r\nthat it would form a new and most powerful cement far outweighing any\r\npolitical objections that might be urged against the system.  In his\r\nopinion \"the liberty and the union of the country were inseparably\r\nunited; that as the destruction of the latter would most certainly\r\ninvolve the former, so its maintenance will with equal certainty\r\npreserve it;\" and he closed with an impressive warning to the Nation of\r\na \"new and terrible danger\" which threatened it, to wit: \"disunion.\"\r\nNobly as he stood up then--during the last term of his service in the\r\nHouse of Representatives--for the great principles of, the American\r\nSystem of Protection to manufactures, for the perpetuity of the Union,\r\nand for the increase of \"National strength,\" it seems like the very\r\nirony of fate that a few years later should find him battling against\r\nProtection as \"unconstitutional,\" upholding Nullification as a \"reserved\r\nright\" of his State, and championing at the risk of his neck that very\r\n\"danger\" to the \"liberties\" and life of his Country against which his\r\nprophetic words had already given solemn warning.\r\n\r\nStrange was it also, in view of the subsequent attitudes of the South\r\nand New England, that this essentially Protective Tariff Act of 1816\r\nshould have been vigorously protested and voted against by New England,\r\nwhile it was ably advocated and voted for by the South--the 25 votes of\r\nthe latter which secured its passage being more than sufficient to have\r\nsecured its defeat had they been so inclined.\r\n\r\nThe Tariff Acts of 1824 and 1828 followed the great American principle\r\nof Protection laid down and supported by the South in the Act of 1816,\r\nwhile widening, increasing, and strengthening it.  Under their\r\noperation-especially under that of 1828, with its high duties on wool,\r\nhemp, iron, lead, and other staples--great prosperity smiled upon the\r\nland, and particularly upon the Free States.\r\n\r\nIn the cotton-growing belt of the South, however, where the prosperity\r\nwas relatively less, owing to the blight of Slavery, the very contrast\r\nbred discontent; and, instead of attributing it to the real cause, the\r\nadvocates of Free Trade within that region insisted that the Protective\r\nTariff was responsible for the condition of things existing there.\r\n\r\nA few restless and discontented spirits in the South had indeed agitated\r\nthe subject of Free Trade as against Protected manufactures as early as\r\n1797, and, hand in hand with it, the doctrine of States Rights.  And\r\nJefferson himself, although, as we have already seen, attached to the\r\nAmerican System of Protection and believing in its Constitutionality,\r\nunwittingly played into the hands of these Free Traders by drawing up\r\nthe famous Kentucky Resolutions of '98 touching States Rights, which\r\nwere closely followed by the Virginia Resolutions of 1799 in the same\r\nvein by Madison, also an out-and-out Protectionist.  It was mainly in\r\ncondemnation of the Alien and Sedition Laws, then so unpopular\r\neverywhere, that these resolutions were professedly fulminated, but they\r\ngave to the agitating Free Traders a States-Rights-Secession-weapon of\r\nwhich they quickly availed themselves.\r\n\r\nTheir drift may be gathered from the first of the Kentucky Resolutions\r\nof '98, which was in these words: \"Resolved, That the several States\r\ncomposing the United States of America are not united on the principle\r\nof unlimited submission to their General Government, but that, by a\r\ncompact under the style and title of a Constitution for the United\r\nStates, and of amendments thereto, they constituted a General Government\r\nfor special purposes--delegated to that Government certain definite\r\npowers, reserving, each State to itself, the residuary mass of right to\r\ntheir own self-government; and that whensoever the General Government\r\nassumes undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of\r\nno force; that to this compact each State acceded as a State, and as an\r\nintegral party, its co-States forming, as to itself, the other party;\r\nthat the Government created by this compact was not made the exclusive\r\nor final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since\r\nthat would have made its discretion, and not the Constitution, the\r\nmeasure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among\r\npowers having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge\r\nfor itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of\r\nredress.\"\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions, after enumerating the Alien and Sedition and certain\r\nother laws as in point, conclude by calling upon the other States to\r\njoin Kentucky in her opposition to such Federal usurpations of power as\r\nthus embodied, and express confidence: \"That they will concur with this\r\nCommonwealth in considering the said Acts as so palpably against the\r\nConstitution as to amount to an undisguised declaration that that\r\ncompact is not meant to be the measure of the powers of the General\r\nGovernment, but that it will proceed in the exercise over these States,\r\nof all powers whatsoever; that they will view this as seizing the rights\r\nof the States, and consolidating them in the hands of the General\r\nGovernment, with the power assumed to bind the States (not merely as to\r\nthe cases made federal (casus foederis) but) in all cases whatsoever, by\r\nlaws made, not with their consent, but by others against their consent;\r\nthat this would be to surrender the form of government we have chosen,\r\nand live under one deriving its powers from its own will, and not from\r\nour authority; and that the co-States, returning to their natural rights\r\nin cases not made federal, will concur in declaring these Acts void and\r\nof no force, and will each take measures of its own in providing that\r\nneither these Acts, nor any others of the General Government, not\r\nplainly and intentionally authorized by the Constitution, shall be\r\nexercised within their respective territories.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of States Rights as formulated in these Resolutions,\r\nincluding the assumed right of a State to nullify laws of the General\r\nGovernment, naturally led up, as we shall see, not only to threats of\r\ndisunion, but ultimately to a dreadful sectional War waged in the effort\r\nto secure it.  That Jefferson, when he penned them, foresaw the terrible\r\nresults to flow from these specious and pernicious doctrines, is not to\r\nbe supposed for an instant; but that his conscience troubled him may be\r\nfairly inferred from the fact that he withheld from the World for twenty\r\nyears afterward the knowledge that he was their author.  It is probable\r\nthat in this case, as in others, he was a victim of that casuistry which\r\nteaches that \"the end justifies the means;\" that he hoped and believed\r\nthat the assertion of these baleful doctrines would act solely as a\r\ncheck upon any tendency to further centralization of power in the\r\nGeneral Government and insure that strict construction of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThough afterward violated by himself at the same time that he for the\r\nmoment threw aside his scruples touching African slavery, when he added\r\nto our domain the great French Slave Colony of Louisiana--was none the\r\nless the great aim of his commanding intellect; and that he fortuitously\r\nbelieved in the \"saving common sense\" of his race and country as capable\r\nof correcting an existing evil when it shall have developed into ill\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n     [Mr. Jefferson takes this very ground, in almost the same words, in\r\n     his letter, 1803, to Wilson C.  Nichols in the Louisiana Colony\r\n     purchase case, when, after proving by his own strict construction\r\n     of the Constitution that there was no power in that instrument to\r\n     make such purchase, and confessing the importance in that very case\r\n     of setting \"an example against broad construction,\" he concludes:\r\n     \"If, however, our friends shall think differently, certainly I\r\n     shall acquiesce with satisfaction; confiding that the good sense of\r\n     the country will correct the evil of construction when it shall\r\n     produce ill ejects.\"]\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, however, the fact remains that the seeds thus sown by\r\nthe hands of Jefferson on the \"sacred soil\" of Virginia and Kentucky,\r\nwere dragon's teeth, destined in after years to spring up as legions of\r\narmed men battling for the subversion of that Constitution and the\r\ndestruction of that Union which he so reverenced, and which he was so\r\nlargely instrumental in founding--and which even came back in his own\r\nlife to plague him and Madison during his embargo, and Madison's war of\r\n1812-15, in the utterances and attitude of some of the New England\r\nFederalists.\r\n\r\nThe few Free Traders of the South--the Giles's and John Taylor's and men\r\nof that ilk--made up for their paucity in numbers by their unscrupulous\r\ningenuity and active zeal.  They put forth the idea that the American\r\nProtective Policy was a policy of fostering combinations by Federal\r\nlaws, the effect of which was to transfer a considerable portion of the\r\nprofits of slave labor from the Slave States to other parts of the Union\r\nwhere it was massed in the hands of a few individuals, and thus created\r\na moneyed interest which avariciously influenced the General Government\r\nto the detriment of the entire community of people, who, made restive by\r\nthe exactions of this power working through the Federal Government, were\r\nas a consequence driven to consider a possible dissolution of the Union,\r\nand make \"estimates of resources and means of defense.\"  As a means also\r\nof inflaming both the poor whites and Southern slave-holders by arousing\r\nthe apprehensions of the latter concerning the \"peculiar institution\" of\r\nSlavery, they craftily declared that \"If the maxim advanced by the\r\nadvocates of the protecting duty system will justify Congress in\r\nassuming, or rather in empowering a few capitalists to assume, the\r\ndirection of manufacturing labor, it also invests that body with a power\r\nof legislating for the direction of every other species of labor and\r\nassigning all occupations whatsoever to the care of the intelligence of\r\nmercenary combinations\"--and hence untold misery to labor.\r\n\r\nThey charged as a further means of firing the Southern heart, that this\r\nmoneyed power, born of Protection, \"works upon the passion of the States\r\nit has been able to delude by computations of their physical strength\r\nand their naval superiority; and by boasting of an ability to use the\r\nweakening circumstance of negro slavery to coerce the defrauded and\r\ndiscontented States into submission.\"  And they declared as fundamental\r\ntruths upon which they rested that \"The Federal is not a National\r\nGovernment; it is a league between nations.  By this league, a limited\r\npower only over persons and property was given to the representatives of\r\nthe united nations.  This power cannot be further extended, under the\r\npretext of national good, because the league does not create a national\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the passage of the Tariff of 1824 that gave these crafty Free\r\nTraders their first great success in spreading their doctrine of Free\r\nTrade by coupling it with questions of slave labor, States Rights, and\r\nnullification, as laid down in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions.\r\nThese arguments created great excitement throughout the South\r\n--especially in South Carolina and Georgia--which was still further\r\nincreased by the passage of the Tariff of 1828, since declared by\r\neminent authority to have been \"the highest and most protective ever\r\nadopted in this country.\"\r\n\r\n     [Mr. Greeley, in his \"History of the American Conflict,\" 1864.]\r\n\r\nPrior to the passage of this Tariff Act, excited assemblages met in some\r\nof the Southern States, and protested against it as an outrage upon\r\ntheir rights--arraying the South in seditious and treasonable attitude\r\nagainst not only the North but the Union, with threats of Secession.  At\r\none of these meetings in South Carolina, in 1827, one of their leaders\r\n--[Dr. Thomas Cooper, President of South Carolina College.]--declared that\r\n\"a drilled and managed majority\" in the House of Representatives had\r\ndetermined \"at all hazards to support the claims of the Northern\r\nmanufacturers, and to offer up the planting interest on the altar of\r\nmonopoly.\"  He denounced the American system of Protection exemplified\r\nin that Tariff measure as \"a system by which the earnings of the South\r\nare to be transferred to the North--by which the many are to be\r\nsacrificed to the few--under which powers are usurped that were never\r\nconceded--by which inequality of rights, inequality of burthens,\r\ninequality of protection, unequal laws, and unequal taxes are to be\r\nenacted and rendered permanent--that the planter and the farmer under\r\nthis system are to be considered as inferior beings to the spinner, the\r\nbleacher, and the dyer--that we of the South hold our plantations under\r\nthis system, as the serfs and operatives of the North, subject to the\r\norders and laboring for the benefit of the master-minds of\r\nMassachusetts, the lords of the spinning jenny and peers of the\r\npower-loom, who have a right to tax our earnings for their emolument,\r\nand to burthen our poverty and to swell their riches;\" and after\r\ncharacterizing Protection as \"a system of fraud, robbery and\r\nusurpation,\" he continued \"I have said that we shall ere long be\r\ncompelled to calculate the value of our Union; and to enquire of what\r\nuse to us is this most unequal alliance, by which the South has always\r\nbeen the loser and the North always the gainer.  Is it worth our while\r\nto continue this union of States, where the North demands to be our\r\nmasters and we are required to be their tributaries? who with the most\r\ninsulting mockery call the yoke they put upon our necks the 'American\r\nsystem!'  The question, however, is fast approaching the alternative of\r\nsubmission or separation.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a few days after this inflammatory speech at Columbus, S. C.,\r\ninciting South Carolinians to resist the pending Protective Tariff even\r\nto the lengths of Secession, during a grand banquet at Richmond, Va.,\r\nWilliam B. Giles--another Free Trade leader--proposed, and those present\r\ndrank a toast to the \"Tariff Schemer\" in which was embodied a\r\ndeclaration that \"The Southerners will not long pay tribute.\"  Despite\r\nthese turbulent and treasonable mutterings, however, the \"Jacksonian\r\nCongress\" passed the Act--a majority of members from the Cotton and New\r\nEngland States voting against, while the vote of the Middle and Western\r\nFree States was almost solidly for, it.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting held soon after the enactment of the Tariff of 1828, at\r\nWalterborough Court House, S. C., an address was adopted and issued\r\nwhich, after reciting the steps that had been taken by South Carolina\r\nduring the previous year to oppose it, by memorials and otherwise, and\r\nstating that, despite their \"remonstrances and implorations,\" a Tariff\r\nBill had passed, not indeed, such as they apprehended, but \"ten-fold\r\nworse in all its oppressive features,\" proceeded thus:\r\n\r\n\"From the rapid step of usurpation, whether we now act or not, the day\r\nof open opposition to the pretended powers of the Constitution cannot be\r\nfar off, and it is that it may not go down in blood that we now call\r\nupon you to resist.  We feel ourselves standing underneath its mighty\r\nprotection, and declaring forth its free and recorded spirit, when we\r\nsay we must resist.  By all the great principles of liberty--by the\r\nglorious achievements of our fathers in defending them--by their noble\r\nblood poured forth like water in maintaining them--by their lives in\r\nsuffering, and their death in honor and in glory;--our countrymen! we\r\nmust resist.  Not secretly, as timid thieves or skulking smugglers--not\r\nin companies and associations, like money chafferers or stock jobbers\r\n--not separately and individually, as if this was ours and not our\r\ncountry's cause--but openly, fairly, fearlessly, and unitedly, as\r\nbecomes a free, sovereign and independent people.  Does timidity ask\r\nWHEN?  We answer NOW!\"\r\n\r\nThese inflammatory utterances, in South Carolina especially, stirred the\r\nSouthern heart more or less throughout the whole cotton belt; and the\r\npernicious principles which they embodied found ardent advocates even in\r\nthe Halls of Congress.  In the Senate, Mr. Hayne, of South Carolina, was\r\ntheir chief and most vehement spokesman, and in 1830 occurred that\r\nmemorable debate between him and Daniel Webster, which forever put an\r\nend to all reasonable justification of the doctrine of Nullification,\r\nand which furnished the ground upon which President Jackson afterward\r\nstood in denouncing and crushing it out with the strong arm of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn that great debate Mr. Hayne's propositions were that the Constitution\r\nis a \"compact between the States,\" that \"in case of a plain, palpable\r\nviolation of the Constitution by the General Government, a State may\r\ninterpose; and that this interposition is constitutional\"--a proposition\r\nwith which Mr. Webster took direct issue, in these words: \"I say, the\r\nright of a State to annul a law of Congress cannot be maintained, but on\r\nthe ground of the inalienable right of man to resist oppression; that is\r\nto say, upon the ground of revolution.  I admit that there is an\r\nultimate violent remedy, above the Constitution and in defiance of the\r\nConstitution, which may be resorted to when a revolution is to be\r\njustified.  But I do not admit that, under the Constitution, and in\r\nconformity with it, there is any mode in which a State Government, as a\r\nmember of the Union, can interfere and stop the progress of the general\r\nmovement by force of her own laws under any circumstances whatever.\"\r\nMr. Webster insisted that \"one of two things is true: either the laws of\r\nthe Union are beyond the discretion and beyond the control of the\r\nStates, or else we have no Constitution of General Government, and are\r\nthrust back again to the days of the Confederation;\" and, in concluding\r\nhis powerful argument, he declared that \"even supposing the Constitution\r\nto be a compact between the States,\" Mr. Hayne's doctrine was \"not\r\nmaintainable, because, first, the General Government is not a party to\r\nthe compact, but a Government established by it, and vested by it with\r\nthe powers of trying and deciding doubtful questions; and secondly,\r\nbecause, if the Constitution be regarded as a compact, not one State\r\nonly, but all the States are parties to that compact, and one can have\r\nno right to fix upon it her own peculiar construction.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the comparatively miserable condition of the cotton-growing States\r\nof the South was attributed by most of the Southern Free Traders solely\r\nto the Protective Tariff of 1828, yet there were some Southerners\r\nwilling to concede--as did Mr. Hayne, in the Senate (1832)--that there\r\nwere \"other causes besides the Tariff\" underlying that condition, and to\r\nadmit that \"Slaves are too improvident, too incapable of that minute,\r\nconstant, delicate attention, and that persevering industry which are\r\nessential to manufacturing establishments,\" the existence of which would\r\nhave made those States prosperous.  But such admissions were unwilling\r\nones, and the Cotton-lords held only with the more tenacity to the view\r\nthat the Tariff was the chief cause of their condition.\r\n\r\nThe Tariff Act of 1832, essentially modifying that of 1828, was passed\r\nwith a view, in part, to quiet Southern clamor.  But the Southern Cotton\r\nStates refused to be mollified.  On the contrary, the Free Traders of\r\nSouth Carolina proceeded to extreme measures, putting in action that\r\nwhich they had before but threatened.  On November 19, 1832, the leading\r\nmen of South Carolina met in Convention, and a few days thereafter\r\n--[November 24,1882]--unanimously passed an Ordinance of Nullification\r\nwhich declared the Tariff Acts of 1828 and 1832 \"Unauthorized by the\r\nConstitution,\" and \"null, void, and no law, nor binding on this State,\r\nits officers, or citizens.\"  The people of the State were forbidden by\r\nit to pay, after the ensuing February 1st, the import-duties therein\r\nimposed.  Under the provisions of the Ordinance, the State Legislature\r\nwas to pass an act nullifying these Tariff laws, and any appeal to the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court against the validity of such nullifying act\r\nwas prohibited.  Furthermore, in the event of the Federal Government\r\nattempting to enforce these Tariff laws, the people of South Carolina\r\nwould thenceforth consider themselves out of the Union, and will\r\n\"forthwith proceed to organize a separate Government, and do all other\r\nacts and things which sovereign and independent States may of right do.\"\r\n\r\nAt the subsequent meeting of the Legislature, Mr. Hayne, who had been a\r\nmember of the Convention, having resigned his seat in the United States\r\nSenate, was elected Governor of the State.  He declared in his message\r\nthat he recognized \"No allegiance as paramount to that which the\r\ncitizens of South Carolina owe to the State of their birth or their\r\nadoption\"--that doctrine of \"paramount allegiance to the State\" which in\r\nafter-years gave so much trouble to the Union and to Union-loving\r\nSoutherners--and declared that he held himself \"bound by the highest of\r\nall obligations to carry into effect, not only the Ordinance of the\r\nConvention, but every act of the Legislature, and every judgment of our\r\nown Courts, the enforcement of which may devolve upon the Executive,\"\r\nand \"if,\" continued he, \"the sacred soil of Carolina should be polluted\r\nby the footsteps of an invader, or be stained with the blood of her\r\ncitizens, shed in her defense, I trust in Almighty God * * * even should\r\nshe stand alone in this great struggle for constitutional liberty,\r\nencompassed by her enemies, that there will not be found, in the wide\r\nlimits of the State, one recreant son who will not fly to the rescue,\r\nand be ready to lay down his life in her defense.\"  In support of the\r\ncontemplated treason, he even went to the length of calling for an\r\nenrolling of volunteer forces and of holding them ready for service.\r\n\r\nBut while South Carolina stood in this treasonable and defiant attitude,\r\narming for war against the Union, there happened to be in the\r\nPresidential chair one of her own sons--General Jackson.  Foreseeing\r\nwhat was coming, he had, prior to the meeting of the Convention that\r\nframed the Nullification Ordinance, ordered General Scott to Charleston\r\nto look after \"the safety of the ports of the United States\"\r\nthereabouts, and had sent to the Collector of that port precise\r\ninstructions as to his duty to resist in all ways any and all attempts\r\nmade under such Ordinance to defeat the operation of the Tariff laws\r\naforesaid.  Having thus quietly prepared the arm of the General\r\nGovernment for the exercise of its power, he issued in December a\r\nProclamation declaring his unalterable resolution to treat Nullification\r\nas Treason--and to crush it.\r\n\r\nIn that famous document President Jackson said of Nullification: \"If\r\nthis doctrine had been established at an earlier day, the Union would\r\nhave been dissolved in its infancy.  The Excise law in Pennsylvania, the\r\nEmbargo and Non-intercourse law in the Eastern States, the Carriage-tax\r\nin Virginia, were all deemed unconstitutional, and were more unequal in\r\ntheir operation than any of the laws now complained of; but fortunately,\r\nnone of those States discovered that they had the right now claimed by\r\nSouth Carolina.  * * * The discovery of this important feature in our\r\nConstitution was reserved for the present day.  To the statesmen of\r\nSouth Carolina belongs the invention, and upon the citizens of that\r\nState will unfortunately fall the evils of reducing it to practice.  * *\r\n* I consider, then, the power to annul a law of the United States,\r\nassumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union,\r\ncontradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized\r\nby its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded\r\nand destructive of the great object for which it was formed.  * * * To\r\nsay that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union, is to say that\r\nthe United States are not a Nation, because it would be a solecism to\r\ncontend that any part of a Nation might dissolve its connection with the\r\nother parts, to their injury or ruin, without committing any, offense.\"\r\n\r\nFarther on, in his moving appeal to the South Carolinians, he bids them\r\nbeware of their leaders: \"Their object is disunion; be not deceived by\r\nnames.  Disunion, by armed force, is Treason.\"  And then, reminding them\r\nof the deeds of their fathers in the Revolution, he proceeds: \"I adjure\r\nyou, as you honor their memory, as you love the cause of freedom to\r\nwhich they dedicated their lives, as you prize the peace of your\r\ncountry, the lives of its best citizens, and your own fair fame, to\r\nretrace your steps.  Snatch from the archives of your State the\r\ndisorganizing edict of its Convention--bid its members to reassemble and\r\npromulgate the decided expression of your will to remain in the path\r\nwhich alone can conduct you to safety, prosperity, and honor--tell them\r\nthat, compared to disunion, all other evils are light, because that\r\nbrings with it an accumulation of all--declare that you will never take\r\nthe field unless the Star-spangled banner of your country shall float\r\nover you--that you will not be stigmatized when dead, and dishonored and\r\nscorned while you live, as the authors of the first attack on the\r\nConstitution of your country!  Its destroyers you cannot be.\"\r\n\r\nAfter asserting his firm \"determination to execute the laws-to preserve\r\nthe Union by all constitutional means\"--he concludes with the prayer,\r\n\"May the great Ruler of Nations grant, that the signal blessings with\r\nwhich He has favored, ours may not, by the madness of party, or personal\r\nambition be disregarded and lost; and may His wise providence bring\r\nthose who have produced this crisis to see the folly before they feel\r\nthe misery, of civil strife; and inspire a returning veneration for that\r\nUnion, which, if we may dare to penetrate His designs, He has chosen as\r\nthe only means of attaining the high destinies to which we may\r\nreasonably aspire.\"\r\n\r\nThe firm attitude of General Jackson, together with the wise\r\nprecautionary measures he had already taken, and the practical unanimity\r\nwith which his declaration to crush out the Treason was hailed in most\r\nof the Southern as well as the Northern States, almost at once broke the\r\nback of Nullification.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [In this connection the following letter, written at that time by\r\n     the great Chief Justice Marshall, to a cousin of his, on the\r\n     subject of State Sovereignty, is of interest, as showing how\r\n     clearly his penetrating intellect perceived the dangers to the\r\n     Union hidden in the plausible doctrine of State Rights:\r\n\r\n     RICHMOND, May 7, 1833.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n     \"I am much indebted to you for your pamphlet on Federal Relations,\r\n     which I have read with much satisfaction.  No subject, as it seems\r\n     to me, is more misunderstood or more perverted.  You have brought\r\n     into view numerous important historical facts which, in my\r\n     judgment, remove the foundation on which the Nullifiers and\r\n     Seceders have erected that superstructure which overshadows our\r\n     Union.  You have, I think, shown satisfactorily that we never have\r\n     been perfectly distinct, independent societies, sovereign in the\r\n     sense in which the Nullifiers use the term.  When colonies we\r\n     certainly were not.  We were parts of the British empire, and\r\n     although not directly connected with each other so far as respected\r\n     government, we were connected in many respects, and were united to\r\n     the same stock.  The steps we took to effect separation were, as\r\n     you have fully shown, not only revolutionary in their nature, but\r\n     they were taken conjointly.  Then, as now, we acted in many\r\n     respects as one people.  The representatives of each colony acted\r\n     for all.  Their resolutions proceeded from a common source, and\r\n     operated on the whole mass.  The army was a continental army\r\n     commanded by a continental general, and supported from a\r\n     continental treasury.  The Declaration of Independence was made by\r\n     a common government, and was made for all the States.\r\n\r\n     \"Everything has been mixed.  Treaties made by Congress have been\r\n     considered as binding all the States.  Some powers have been\r\n     exercised by Congress, some by the States separately.  The lines\r\n     were not strictly drawn.  The inability of Congress to carry its\r\n     legitimate powers into execution has gradually annulled those\r\n     powers practically, but they always existed in theory.\r\n     Independence was declared `in the name and by the authority of the\r\n     good people of these colonies.' In fact we have always been united\r\n     in some respects, separate in others.  We have acted as one people\r\n     for some purposes, as distinct societies for others.  I think you\r\n     have shown this clearly, and in so doing have demonstrated the\r\n     fallacy of the principle on which either nullification or the right\r\n     of peaceful, constitutional secession is asserted.\r\n\r\n     \"The time is arrived when these truths must be more generally\r\n     spoken, or our Union is at an end.  The idea of complete\r\n     sovereignty of the State converts our government into a league,\r\n     and, if carried into practice, dissolves the Union.\r\n\r\n     \"I am, dear sir,\r\n\r\n     \"Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n     \"J. MARSHALL.\r\n\r\n     \"HUMPHREY MARSHALL, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n     \"FRANKFORT, KY.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nullifiers hailed with pretended satisfaction the report from the\r\nHouse Committee on Ways and Means of a Bill making great reductions and\r\nequalizations of Tariff duties, as a measure complying with their\r\ndemands, and postponed the execution of the Ordinance of Nullification\r\nuntil the adjournment of Congress; and almost immediately afterward Mr.\r\nClay's Compromise Tariff Act of 1833 \"whereby  one tenth of the excess\r\nover twenty per cent. of each and every existing impost was to be taken\r\noff at the close of that year; another tenth two years thereafter; so\r\nproceeding until the 30th of June, 1842, when all duties should be\r\nreduced to a maximum of twenty per cent.\"--[Says Mr. Greeley, in his\r\nHistory aforesaid.]--agreed to by Calhoun and other Nullifiers, was\r\npassed, became a law without the signature of President Jackson, and\r\nSouth Carolina once more became to all appearances a contented,\r\nlaw-abiding State of the Union.\r\n\r\nBut after-events proved conclusively that the enactment of this\r\nCompromise Tariff was a terrible blunder, if not a crime.  Jackson had\r\nfully intended to hang Calhoun and his nullifying coadjutors if they\r\npersisted in their Treason.  He knew that they had only seized upon the\r\nTariff laws as a pretext with which to justify Disunion, and prophesied\r\nthat \"the next will be the Slavery or Negro question.\"  Jackson's\r\nforecast was correct.  Free Trade, Slavery and Secession were from that\r\ntime forward sworn allies; and the ruin wrought to our industries by the\r\ndisasters of 1840, plainly traceable to that Compromise Tariff measure\r\nof 1833, was only to be supplemented by much greater ruin and disasters\r\ncaused by the Free Trade Tariff of 1846--and to be followed by the armed\r\nRebellion of the Free Trade and Pro-Slavery States of the South in 1861,\r\nin a mad attempt to destroy the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n                    GROWTH OF THE SLAVERY QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that during the period of the Missouri Struggle,\r\n1818-1820, the Territory of Arkansas was formed by an Act of Congress\r\nout of that part of the Missouri Territory not included in the proposed\r\nState of Missouri, and that the Act so creating the Territory of\r\nArkansas contained no provision restricting Slavery.  Early in 1836, the\r\npeople of Arkansas Territory met in Convention and formed a Constitution\r\nunder which, \"and by virtue of the treaty of cession by France to the\r\nUnited States, of the Province of Louisiana,\" they asked admission to\r\nthe Union as a State.  Among other provisions of that Constitution was a\r\nsection rendering the State Legislature powerless to pass laws for the\r\nemancipation of slaves without the consent of the owners, or to prevent\r\nemigrants to that State from bringing with them slaves.  On June 15th of\r\nthe same year, Arkansas was, under that Constitution, admitted to the\r\nUnion as a Slave State, with the sole reservation, that nothing in the\r\nAct of admission should be \"construed as an assent by Congress to all or\r\nany of the propositions contained\" in the said Constitution.\r\n \r\nLong ere this, all the Northern and Middle States had made provision for\r\nthe emancipation of such slaves as remained within their borders, and\r\nonly a few years previous (in 1829 and 1831-32) Virginia had made strong\r\nbut insufficient efforts toward the same end.  The failure to free\r\nVirginia of Slavery--the effort to accomplish which had been made by\r\nsome of the greatest of her statesmen--only served to rivet the chains\r\nof human bondage more securely throughout all the Slave States, and from\r\nthat time on, no serious agitation occurred in any one of them, looking\r\ntoward even the most gradual emancipation.  On the other hand, the\r\nadvocates of the extension of the Slave-Power by the expansion of\r\nSlave-territory, were ever on the alert, they considered it of the last\r\nimportance to maintain the balance of power between the Slave States and\r\nthe Free States.  Hence, while they had secured in 1819 the cession from\r\nSpain to the United States of the Slave-holding Floridas, and the\r\norganization of the Slave Territory of Florida in 1822--which\r\nsubsequently came in as a Slave State under the same Act (1845) that\r\nadmitted the Free State of Iowa--their greedy eyes were now cast upon\r\nthe adjoining rich territories of Mexico.\r\n\r\nEfforts had (in 1827-1829) been made to purchase from Mexico the domain\r\nwhich was known as Texas.  They had failed.  But already a part of Texas\r\nhad been settled by adventurous Americans under Mexican grants and\r\notherwise; and General Sam Houston, an adherent of the Slave Power,\r\nhaving become a leading spirit among them, fomented a revolution.  In\r\nMarch, 1836, Texas, under his guidance, proclaimed herself a Republic\r\nindependent of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe War that ensued between Texas and Mexico ended in the flight of the\r\nMexican Army and the capture of Santa Anna at San Jacinto, and a treaty\r\nrecognizing Texan independence.  In October, 1836, General Houston was\r\ninaugurated President of the Republic of Texas.  Close upon this\r\nfollowed (in August, 1837) a proposition to our Government from the\r\nTexan envoy for the annexation of Texas to the United States.  President\r\nVan Buren declined the offer.  The Northern friends of Freedom were as\r\nmuch opposed to this annexation project as the advocates of Slavery were\r\nanxious for it.  Even such conservative Northern Statesmen as Daniel\r\nWebster strongly opposed the project.  In a speech delivered in New York\r\n[1837], after showing that the chief aim of our Government in the\r\nacquisition of the Territory of Louisiana was to gain command of the\r\nmouths of the great rivers to the sea, and that in the acquisition of\r\nthe Floridas our policy was based on similar considerations, Mr. Webster\r\ndeclared that \"no such necessity, no such policy, requires the\r\nannexation of Texas,\" and that we ought \"for numerous and powerful\r\nreasons to be content with our present boundaries.\"  He recognized that\r\nSlavery already existed under the guarantees of the Constitution and\r\nthose guarantees must be fulfilled; that \"Slavery, as it exists in the\r\nStates, is beyond the power of Congress.  It is a concern of the States\r\nthemselves,\" but \"when we come to speak of admitting new States, the\r\nsubject assumes an entirely different aspect.  Our rights and our duties\r\nare then both different.  The Free States, and all the States, are then\r\nat liberty to accept or to reject;\" and he added, \"In my opinion the\r\npeople of the United States will not consent to bring into the Union a\r\nnew, vastly extensive and Slaveholding country, large enough for a half\r\na dozen or a dozen States.  In my opinion, they ought not to consent to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nFarther on, in the same speech--after alluding to the strong feeling in\r\nthe Northern States against the extension of Slavery, not only as a\r\nquestion of politics, but of conscience and religious conviction as\r\nwell-he deems him a rash man indeed \"who supposes that a feeling of this\r\nkind is to be trifled with or despised.\"  Said he: \"It will assuredly\r\ncause itself to be respected.  It may be reasoned with; it may be made\r\nwilling--I believe it is entirely willing--to fulfill all existing\r\nengagements and all existing duties--to uphold and defend the\r\nConstitution as it is established, with whatever regrets about some\r\nprovisions which it does actually contain.  But to coerce it into\r\nsilence, to endeavor to restrain its free expression, to seek to\r\ncompress and confine it, warm as it is, and more heated as such\r\nendeavors would inevitably render it,--should this be attempted, I know\r\nnothing, even in the Constitution or in the Union itself, which would\r\nnot be endangered by the explosion which might follow.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1840, General Harrison, the Whig candidate, was elected to the\r\nPresidency, but died within a few weeks after his inauguration in 1841,\r\nand was succeeded by John Tyler.  The latter favored the Slave Power;\r\nand on April 12th, 1844, John C.  Calhoun, his Secretary of State,\r\nconcluded with Texas a treaty of annexation--which was, however,\r\nrejected by the Senate.  Meanwhile the public mind was greatly agitated\r\nover the annexation and other, questions.\r\n\r\n     [In the London Index, a journal established there by Jefferson\r\n     Davis's agents to support the cause of the rebellious States, a\r\n     communication appeared during the early part of the war, Dec.  4,\r\n     1861, supposed to have been written by Mr. Mason, of Virginia, in\r\n     which he said: \"To tell the Norths, the Butes, the Wedderburns of\r\n     the present day, that previous to the year 1839 the sovereign\r\n     States of the South had unalterably resolved on the specific ground\r\n     of the violation of the Federal Constitution by the tariff of\r\n     spoliation which the New England States had imposed upon them--to\r\n     secede from the Union; to tell them that in that year the leader of\r\n     the South, Calhoun, urged an English gentleman, to whom he had\r\n     fully explained the position of the South, and the intolerable\r\n     tyranny which the North inflicted upon it, to be the bearer of\r\n     credentials from the chief persons of the South, in order to invite\r\n     the attention of the British Government to the coming event; that\r\n     on his death-bed (Washington, March 31, 1850), he called around him\r\n     his political friends--one of whom is now in England--warned them\r\n     that in no event could the Union survive the Presidential election\r\n     of 1860, though it might possibly break up before that urged them\r\n     to be prepared; leaving with his dying words the sacred cause of\r\n     Southern secession a solemn legacy in their hands--to have told\r\n     this to the Norths and Dartmouths of the present day, with more and\r\n     even stronger evidence of the coming events of November, 1860,\r\n     would have been like speaking to the stones of the street.  In\r\n     November, 1860, they were thoroughly ignorant of all the momentous\r\n     antecedents of secession--of their nature, their character, their\r\n     bearing, import, and consequences.\"\r\n\r\n     In the same correspondence the distinguished Rebel emissary\r\n     substantially let out the fact that Calhoun was indirectly, through\r\n     himself (Mason), in secret communication with the British\r\n     Government as far back as 1841, with a view to securing its\r\n     powerful aid in his aforesaid unalterable resolve to Secede from\r\n     the Union; and then Mr. Mason pleads--but pleads in vain--for the\r\n     armed intervention of England at this later day.  Said he:\r\n\r\n     \"In the year 1841 the late Sir William Napier sent in two plans for\r\n     subduing the Union, to the War Office, in the first of which the\r\n     South was to be treated as an enemy, in the second as a friend and\r\n     ally.  I was much consulted by him as to the second plan and was\r\n     referred to by name in it, as he showed by the acknowledgment of\r\n     this in Lord Fitzroy Somerset's letter of reply.  This plan fully\r\n     provided for the contingency of an invasion of Canada, and its\r\n     application would, in eighteen or twenty months, have reduced the\r\n     North to a much more impotent condition than it exhibits at\r\n     present.  At this very moment the most difficult portion of that\r\n     plan has been perfectly accomplished by the South itself; and the\r\n     North, in accordance with Sir William Napier's expectations, now\r\n     lies helpless before England, and at our absolute mercy.  Nor is\r\n     there any doubt of this, and if Lord Palmerston is not aware of it\r\n     Mr. Seward certainly is.  We have nothing remaining to do but to\r\n     stretch out our arm in the way Sir William Napier proposed, and the\r\n     Northern power--power as we ignorantly call it--must come to an\r\n     end.  Sir William knew and well estimated the elements of which\r\n     that quasi power consisted; and he knew how to apply the\r\n     substantive power of England to dissolve it.  In the best interest\r\n     of humanity, I venture to say that it is the duty of England to\r\n     apply this power without further delay--its duty to itself, to its\r\n     starving operatives, to France, to Europe, and to humanity.  And in\r\n     the discharge of this great duty to the world at large there will\r\n     not even be the dignity of sacrifice or danger.\"]\r\n\r\nThreats and counter-threats of Disunion were made on either hand by the\r\nopponents and advocates of Slavery-extension through annexation; nor was\r\nit less agitated on the subject of a Protective Tariff.\r\n\r\nThe Compromise Tariff of 1833, together with President Jackson's\r\nupheaval of our financial system, produced, as has already been hinted,\r\nterrible commercial disasters. \"In 1840,\" says competent authority, \"all\r\nprices had ruinously fallen; production had greatly diminished, and in\r\nmany departments of industry had practically ceased; thousands of\r\nworking men were idle, with no hope of employment, and their families\r\nsuffering from want.  Our farmers were without markets, their products\r\nrotted in their barns, and their lands, teeming with rich harvests, were\r\nsold by the sheriff for debts and taxes.  The Tariff, which robbed our\r\nindustries of Protection failed to supply Government with its necessary\r\nrevenues.  The National Treasury in consequence was bankrupt, and the\r\ncredit of the Nation had sunk very low.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Clay himself stated \"the average depression in the value of property\r\nunder that state of things which existed before the Tariff of 1842 came\r\nto the rescue of the country, at fifty per cent.\"  And hence it was that\r\nProtection was made the chief issue of the Presidential campaign of\r\n1840, which eventuated in the election of Harrison and Tyler, and in the\r\nTariff Act of August 30, 1842, which revived our trade and industries,\r\nand brought back to the land a full measure of prosperity.  With those\r\ndisasters fresh in the minds of the people, Protection continued to be a\r\nleading issue in the succeeding Presidential campaign of 1844--but\r\ncoupled with the Texas-annexation issue.  In that campaign Henry Clay\r\nwas the candidate of the Whig party and James K. Polk of the Democratic\r\nparty.  Polk was an ardent believer in the annexation policy and stood\r\nupon a platform declaring for the \"re-occupation of Oregon and the\r\nre-annexation of Texas at the earliest practicable moment\"--as if the\r\nprefix \"re\" legitimatized the claim in either case; Clay, on the other\r\nhand, held that we had \"fairly alienated our title to Texas by solemn\r\nNational compacts, to the fulfilment of which we stand bound by good\r\nfaith and National honor;\" that \"Annexation and War with Mexico are\r\nidentical,\" and that he was \"not willing to involve this country in a\r\nforeign War for the object of acquiring Texas.\"\r\n\r\n     [In his letter of April 17, 1844, published in the National\r\n     Intelligencer.]\r\n\r\nAs to the Tariff issue also, Clay was the acknowledged champion of the\r\nAmerican system of Protection, while Polk was opposed to it, and was\r\nsupported by the entire Free-trade sentiment, whether North or South.\r\n\r\nAs the campaign progressed, it became evident that Clay would be\r\nelected.  Then occurred some of those fatalities which have more than\r\nonce, in the history of Presidential campaigns, overturned the most\r\nreasonable expectations and defeated the popular will.  Mr. Clay\r\ncommitted a blunder and Mr. Polk an equivocation--to use the mildest\r\npossible term.  Mr. Clay was induced by Southern friends to write a\r\nletter--[Published in the North Alabamian, Aug.  16, 1844.]--in which,\r\nafter stating that \"far from having any personal objection to the\r\nannexation of Texas, I should be glad to see it--without dishonor,\r\nwithout War, with the common consent of the Union, and upon just and\r\nfair terms,\" he added: \"I do not think that the subject of Slavery ought\r\nto affect the question, one way or the other.\"  Mr. Polk, on the other\r\nhand, wrote a letter in which he declared it to be \"the duty of the\r\nGovernment to extend, as far as it may be practicable to do so, by its\r\nrevenue laws and all other means within its power, fair and just\r\nProtection to all the great interests of the whole Union, embracing\r\nAgriculture, Manufactures, the Mechanic Arts, Commerce and Navigation.\"\r\nThis was supplemented by a letter (August 8, 1844) from Judge Wilson\r\nMcCandless of Pennsylvania, strongly upholding the Protective principle,\r\nclaiming that Clay in his Compromise Tariff Bill had abandoned it, and\r\nthat Polk and Dallas had \"at heart the true interests of Pennsylvania.\"\r\nClay, thus betrayed by the treachery of Southern friends, was greatly\r\nweakened, while Polk, by his beguiling letter, backed by the false\r\ninterpretation put upon it by powerful friends in the North, made the\r\nNorth believe him a better Protectionist than Clay.\r\n\r\nPolk was elected, and rewarded the misplaced confidence by making Robert\r\nJ.  Walker his Secretary of the Treasury, and, largely through that\r\ngreat Free Trader's exertions, secured a repeal by Congress of the\r\nProtective Tariff of 1842 and the enactment of the ruinous Free Trade\r\nTariff of 1846.  Had Clay carried New York, his election was secure.  As\r\nit happened, Polk had a plurality in New York of but 5,106 in an immense\r\nvote, and that slim plurality was given to him by the Abolitionists\r\nthrowing away some 15,000 on Birney.  And thus also it curiously\r\nhappened that it was the Abolition vote which secured the election of\r\nthe candidate who favored immediate annexation and the extension of the\r\nSlave Power!\r\n\r\nEmboldened and apparently sustained by the result of the election, the\r\nSlave Power could not await the inauguration of Mr. Polk, but proceeded\r\nat once, under whip and spur, to drive the Texas annexation scheme\r\nthrough Congress; and two days before the 4th of March, 1845, an Act\r\nconsenting to the admission of the Republic of Texas as a State of the\r\nUnion was approved by President Tyler.\r\n\r\nIn that Act it was provided that \"New States of convenient size, not\r\nexceeding four in number, in addition to the said State of Texas, and\r\nhaving sufficient population, may hereafter, by the consent of said\r\nState, be formed out of the territory thereof, which shall be entitled\r\nto admission under the provisions of the Federal Constitution; and such\r\nStates as may be formed out of that portion of said territory lying\r\nsouth of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude, commonly\r\nknown as the Missouri Compromise line, shall be admitted into the Union\r\nwith or without Slavery, as the people of each State asking admission\r\nmay desire.  And in such State or States as shall be formed out of said\r\nterritory north of said Missouri Compromise line, Slavery or involuntary\r\nservitude (except for crime) shall be prohibited.\"  As has been lucidly\r\nstated by another,--[Greeley's History]--\"while seeming to curtail and\r\ncircumscribe Slavery north of the above parallel (that of 36  30' north\r\nlatitude), this measure really extended it northward to that parallel,\r\nwhich it had not yet approached, under the flag of Texas, within\r\nhundreds of miles.  But the chief end of this sham Compromise was the\r\ninvolving of Congress in an indirect indorsement of the claim of Texas\r\nto the entire left bank of the Rio Grande, from its mouth to its source;\r\nand this was effected.\"\r\n\r\nTexas quickly consented to the Act of annexation, and in December, 1845,\r\na Joint Resolution formally admitting her as a State of the Union,\r\nreported by Stephen A.  Douglas, was duly passed.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1846, the American forces under General Taylor, which had been\r\ndispatched to protect Texas from threatened assault, were attacked by\r\nthe Mexican army, which at Palo Alto was badly defeated and at Resaca de\r\nla Palma driven back across the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nCongress immediately declared that by this invasion a state of War\r\nexisted between Mexico and the United States.  Thus commenced the War\r\nwith Mexico--destined to end in the triumph of the American Army, and\r\nthe acquisition of large areas of territory to the United States.  In\r\nanticipation of such triumph, President Polk lost little time in asking\r\nan appropriation of over two million dollars by Congress to facilitate\r\nnegotiations for peace with, and territorial cession from, Mexico.  And\r\na Bill making such appropriation was quickly passed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives--but with the following significant proviso attached,\r\nwhich had been offered by Mr. Wilmot: \"Provided.  That as an express and\r\nfundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory from the\r\nRepublic of Mexico by the United States, by virtue of any treaty that\r\nmay be negotiated between them, and to the use by the Executive of the\r\nmoneys herein appropriated, neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude\r\nshall ever exist in any part of said territory, except for crime,\r\nwhereof the party shall first be duly convicted.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate in the Senate upon the Wilmot proviso, which immediately\r\nensued, was cut short by the expiration of the Session of Congress--and\r\nthe Bill accordingly failed of passage.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1848, the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was made between\r\nMexico and the United States, and Peace reigned once more.  About the\r\nsame time a Bill was passed by the Senate providing Territorial\r\nGovernments for Oregon, California and New Mexico, which provided for\r\nthe reference of all questions touching Slavery in such Territories to\r\nthe United States Supreme Court, for arbitration.  The Bill, however,\r\nfailed in the House.  The ensuing Presidential campaign resulted in the\r\nelection of General Taylor, the Whig candidate, who was succeeded upon\r\nhis death, July 10, 1850, by Fillmore.  Meanwhile, on the Oregon\r\nTerritory Bill, in 1848, a strong effort had been made by Mr. Douglas\r\nand others to incorporate a provision extending to the Pacific Ocean the\r\nMissouri Compromise line of 36  30' of north latitude and extending to\r\nall future organizations of Territories of the United States the\r\nprinciples of said Compromise.  This provision was adopted by the\r\nSenate, but the House struck it from the Bill; the Senate receded, and\r\nOregon was admitted as a Free Territory.  But the conflict in Congress\r\nbetween those who would extend and those who would restrict Slavery\r\nstill continued, and indeed gathered vehemence with time.  In 1850,\r\nCalifornia was clamoring for admission as a Free State to the Union, and\r\nNew Mexico and Utah sought to be organized under Territorial\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nIn the heated discussions upon questions growing out of bills for these\r\npurposes, and to rectify the boundaries of Texas, it was no easy matter\r\nto reach an agreement of any sort.  Finally, however, the Compromise of\r\n1850, offered by Mr. Clay, was practically agreed to and carried out,\r\nand under it: California was admitted as a Free State; New Mexico and\r\nUtah were admitted to Territorial organization without a word pro or con\r\non the subject of Slavery; the State of Texas was awarded a pecuniary\r\ncompensation for the rectification of her boundaries; the Slave Trade in\r\nthe District of Columbia was abolished; and a more effectual Fugitive\r\nSlave Act passed.\r\n\r\nBy both North and South, this Compromise of 1850, and the measures\r\ngrowing out of it, were very generally acquiesced in, and for a while it\r\nseemed as though a permanent settlement of the Slavery question had been\r\nreached.  But in the Fugitive Slave law, thus hastily enacted, lay\r\nembedded the seed for further differences and excitements, speedily to\r\ngerminate.  In its operation it proved not only unnecessarily cruel and\r\nharsh, in the manner of the return to bondage of escaped slaves, but\r\nalso afforded a shield and support to the kidnapping of Free Negroes\r\nfrom Northern States.  The frequency of arrests in the Northern States,\r\nand the accompanying circumstances of cruelty and brutality in the\r\nexecution of the law, soon made it especially odious throughout the\r\nNorth, and created an active feeling of commiseration for the unhappy\r\nvictims of the Slave Power, which greatly intensified and increased the\r\ngrowing Anti-Slavery sentiment in the Free States.\r\n\r\nIn 1852-53, an attempt was made in Congress to organize into the\r\nTerritory of Nebraska, the region of country lying west of Iowa and\r\nMissouri.  Owing to the opposition of the South the Bill was defeated.\r\nIn 1853-4 a similar Bill was reported to the Senate by Mr. Douglas, but\r\nafterward at his own instance recommitted to the Committee on\r\nTerritories, and reported back by him again in such shape as to create,\r\ninstead of one, two Territories, that portion directly west of Missouri\r\nto be called Kansas, and the balance to be known as Nebraska--one of the\r\nsections of the Bill enacting:\r\n\r\n\"That in order to avoid all misconstruction it is hereby declared to be\r\nthe true intent and meaning of this Act, so far as the question of\r\nSlavery is concerned, to carry into practical operation the following\r\npropositions and principles, established by the Compromise measures of\r\n1850, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"First, That all questions pertaining to Slavery in the Territories, and\r\nthe new States to be formed therefrom, are to be left to the decision of\r\nthe people residing therein through their appropriate representatives.\r\n\r\n\"Second, That 'all cases involving title to slaves,' and 'questions of\r\npersonal freedom,' are referred to the adjudication of the local\r\ntribunals with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\"Third, That the provisions of the Constitution and laws of the United\r\nStates, in respect to fugitives from service, are to be carried into\r\nfaithful execution in all the `organized Territories,' the same as in\r\nthe States.\"\r\n\r\nThe sections authorizing Kansas and Nebraska to elect and send delegates\r\nto Congress also prescribed:\r\n\r\n\"That the Constitution, and all laws of the United States which are not\r\nlocally inapplicable, shall have the same force and effect within the\r\nsaid Territory, as elsewhere in the United States, except the section of\r\nthe Act preparatory to the admission of Missouri into the Union,\r\napproved March 6th, 1820, which was superseded by the principles of the\r\nLegislation of 1850, commonly called the Compromise Measures, and is\r\ndeclared inoperative.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when \"explaining this Kansas-Nebraska Bill\" Mr. Douglas announced\r\nthat, in reporting it, \"The object of the Committee was neither to\r\nlegislate Slavery in or out of the Territories; neither to introduce nor\r\nexclude it; but to remove whatever obstacle Congress had put there, and\r\napply the doctrine of Congressional Non-intervention in accordance with\r\nthe principles of the Compromise Measures of 1850, and allow the people\r\nto do as they pleased upon this as well as all other matters affecting\r\ntheir interests.\"\r\n\r\nA vigorous and able debate ensued.  A motion by Mr. Chase to strike out\r\nthe words \"which was superseded by the principles of the legislation of\r\n1850, commonly called the Compromise Measures,\" was defeated decisively.\r\nSubsequently Mr. Douglas moved to strike out the same words and insert\r\nin place of them, these: \"which being inconsistent with the principles\r\nof Non-intervention by Congress with Slavery in the States and\r\nTerritories, as recognized by the legislation of 1850 (commonly called\r\nthe Compromise Measures), is hereby declared inoperative and void; it\r\nbeing the true intent and meaning of this Act not to legislate Slavery\r\ninto any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave\r\nthe people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic\r\ninstitutions in their own way, subject only to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States\"--and the motion was agreed to by a vote of 35 yeas to 10\r\nnays.  Mr. Chase immediately moved to add to the amendment just adopted\r\nthese words: \"Under which, the people of the Territory, through their\r\nappropriate representatives, may, if they see fit, prohibit the\r\nexistence of Slavery therein;\" but this motion was voted down by 36 nays\r\nto 10 yeas.  This developed the rat in the meal-tub.  The people were to\r\nbe \"perfectly free\" to act either way on the subject of Slavery, so long\r\nas they did not prohibit Slavery!  In this shape the Bill passed the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nPublic sentiment in the North was greatly stirred by this direct attempt\r\nto repeal the Missouri Compromise.  But by the superior parliamentary\r\ntactics of Southern Representatives in the House, whereby the radical\r\nfriends of Freedom were shut out from the opportunity of amendment, a\r\nHouse Bill essentially the same as the Senate Bill was subsequently\r\npassed by the House, under the previous question, and afterward rapidly\r\npassed the Senate, and was approved by the President.  At once commenced\r\nthat long and terrible struggle between the friends of Free-Soil and the\r\nfriends of Slavery, for the possession of Kansas, which convulsed the\r\nwhole Country for years, and moistened the soil of that Territory with\r\nstreams of blood, shed in numerous \"border-ruffian\" conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe Territorial Government of Kansas was organized late in 1854, and an\r\n\"election\" for Delegate held, at which the Pro-Slavery candidate\r\n(Whitfield) was fraudulently elected.  On March 30, 1855, a Territorial\r\nLegislature was similarly chosen by Pro-Slavery voters \"colonized\" from\r\nMissouri.  That Legislature, upon its meeting, proceeded at once to\r\nenact most outrageous Pro-Slavery laws, which being vetoed by the\r\nFree-Soil Governor (Reeder), were passed over the veto, and the Free-Soil\r\nGovernor had to give place to one who favored Slavery in Kansas.  But\r\nthe Free-Soil settlers of Kansas, in Mass Convention at Big Springs,\r\nutterly repudiated the bogus Legislature and all its acts, to which they\r\nrefused submission.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these radical differences, two separate elections for\r\nDelegate in Congress were held by the opposing factions, at one of which\r\nwas elected the Pro-Slavery Whitfield, and at the other the Free-Soiler\r\nReeder.  Furthermore, under a call issued by the Big Springs Convention,\r\na Free-State Constitutional Convention was held in October, 1855, at\r\nTopeka, which framed a Free-State Constitution, and asked admission\r\nunder it to the Union.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, the House of Representatives--which, after a protracted\r\nstruggle, had elected N. P. Banks Speaker--passed a Bill, by a bare\r\nmajority, admitting Kansas under her Topeka Constitution; but the Senate\r\ndefeated it.  July 4, 1856, by order of President Pierce, the Free-State\r\nLegislature, chosen under the Topeka Constitution to meet at Topeka, was\r\ndispersed by United States Troops.  Yet, despite all oppositions,\r\ndiscouragements, and outrages, the Free-State population of\r\nKansas continued to increase from immigration.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, the Pro-Slavery Legislature elected by the Pro-Slavery voters\r\nat their own special election--the Free-State voters declining to\r\nparticipate--called a Constitutional Convention at Lecompton, which\r\nformed a Pro-Slavery Constitution.  This was submitted to the people in\r\nsuch dexterous manner that they could only vote \"For the Constitution\r\nwith Slavery\" or \"For the Constitution without Slavery\"--and, as the\r\nConstitution prescribed that \"the rights of property in Slaves now in\r\nthe Territory, shall in no manner be interfered with,\" to vote \"for the\r\nConstitution Without Slavery\" was an absurdity only paralleled by the\r\ncourse of the United States Senate in refusing to permit the people of\r\nKansas \"to prohibit Slavery\" while at the same time declaring them\r\n\"perfectly free to act\" as they chose in the matter.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, with Slavery, was thus adopted by a vote of over\r\n6,000.  But in the meanwhile, at another general election held for the\r\npurpose, and despite all the frauds perpetrated by the Pro-Slavery men,\r\na Free-State Legislature, and Free-State Delegate to Congress had been\r\nelected; and this Legislature submitted the Lecompton Pro-Slavery\r\nConstitution to the people, January 4, 1858, so that they could vote:\r\n\"For the Lecompton Constitution with Slavery,\" \"For the Lecompton\r\nConstitution without Slavery,\" or \"Against the Lecompton Constitution.\"\r\nThe consequence was that the Lecompton Constitution was defeated by a\r\nmajority of over 10,000 votes--the Missouri Pro-Slavery colonists\r\ndeclining to recognize the validity of any further election on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in part upon the issues growing out of this Kansas conflict,\r\nthe political parties of the Nation had passed through another\r\nPresidential campaign (1856), in which the Democratic candidate Buchanan\r\nhad been elected over Fremont the \"Republican,\" and Fillmore the\r\n\"American,\" candidates.  Both Houses of Congress being now Democratic,\r\nMr. Buchanan recommended them to accept and ratify the Lecompton\r\nPro-Slavery Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1858, the Senate passed a Bill--against the efforts of Stephen\r\nA.  Douglas--accepting it.  In the House, however, a substitute offered\r\nby Mr. Montgomery (Douglas Democrat) known as the Crittenden-Montgomery\r\nCompromise, was adopted.  The Senate refused to concur, and the report\r\nof a Committee of Conference--providing for submitting to the Kansas\r\npeople a proposition placing limitations upon certain public land\r\nadvantages stipulated for in the Lecompton Constitution, and in case\r\nthey rejected the proposition that another Constitutional Convention\r\nshould be held--was adopted by both Houses; and the proposition being\r\nrejected by the people of Kansas, the Pro-Slavery Lecompton Constitution\r\nfell with it.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 a Convention, called by the Territorial Legislature for the\r\npurpose, met at Wyandot, and framed a Free State Constitution which was\r\nadopted by the people in October of that year, and at the ensuing State\r\nelection in December the State went Republican.  In April, 1860, the\r\nHouse of Representatives passed a Bill admitting Kansas as a State under\r\nthat Constitution, but the Democratic Senate adjourned without action on\r\nthe Bill; and it was not until early in 1861 that Kansas was at last\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Free Trade Tariff of 1846 had produced the train of\r\nbusiness and financial disasters that its opponents predicted.  Instead\r\nof prosperity everywhere in the land, there was misery and ruin.  Even\r\nthe discovery and working of the rich placer mines of California and the\r\nconsequent flow, in enormous volume, of her golden treasure into the\r\nEastern States, could not stay-the wide-spread flood of disaster.\r\nPresident Fillmore, who had succeeded General Taylor on the latter's\r\ndeath, frequently called the attention of Congress to the evils produced\r\nby this Free Trade, and to the necessity of protecting our manufactures\r\n\"from ruinous competition from abroad.\"  So also with his successor,\r\nPresident Buchanan, who, in his Message of 1857, declared that \"In the\r\nmidst of unsurpassed plenty in all the productions and in all the\r\nelements of national wealth, we find our manufactures suspended, our\r\npublic works retarded, our private enterprises of different kinds\r\nabandoned, and thousands of useful laborers thrown out of employment and\r\nreduced to want.\"  Further than this, the financial credit of the Nation\r\nwas at zero.  It was financially bankrupt before the close of Buchanan's\r\nPresidential term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                          POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY.\r\n\r\nBut now occurred the great Presidential struggle of 1860--which\r\ninvolved not alone the principles of Protection, but those of human\r\nFreedom, and the preservation of the Union itself--between Abraham\r\nLincoln of Illinois, the candidate of the Republican party, as against\r\nStephen A. Douglas of Illinois, the National or Douglas-Democratic\r\ncandidate, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, the Administration or\r\nBreckinridge-Democratic candidate, and John Bell of Tennessee, the\r\ncandidate of the Bell-Union party.  The great preliminary struggle which\r\nlargely influenced the determination of the Presidential political\r\nconflict of 1860, had, however, taken place in the State of Illinois,\r\ntwo years previously.  To that preliminary political contest of 1858,\r\ntherefore, we will now turn our eyes--and, in order to fully understand\r\nit, it may be well to glance back over a few years.  In 1851 the\r\nLegislature of Illinois had adopted--[The vote in the House being 65\r\nyeas to 4 nays.]--the following resolution: \"Resolved, That our Liberty\r\nand Independence are based upon the right of the people to form for\r\nthemselves such a government as they may choose; that this great\r\nprinciple, the birthright of freemen, the gift of Heaven, secured to us\r\nby the blood of our ancestors, ought to be secured to future\r\ngenerations, and no limitation ought to be applied to this power in the\r\norganization of any Territory of the United States, of either\r\nTerritorial Government or State Constitution, provided the government so\r\nestablished shall be Republican and in conformity with the Constitution\r\nof the United States.\"  This resolution was a practical endorsement of\r\nthe course of Stephen A. Douglas in supporting the Compromise measures\r\nof 1850, which he had defended as being \"all founded upon the great\r\nprinciple that every people ought to possess the right to form and\r\nregulate their own domestic institutions in their own way,\" and that\r\n\"the same principle\" should be \"extended to all of the Territories of\r\nthe United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with his views and the resolution aforesaid, Mr. Douglas\r\nin 1854, as we have already seen, incorporated in the Kansas-Nebraska\r\nBill a clause declaring it to be \"the true intent and meaning of the Act\r\nnot to legislate Slavery into any State or Territory, or to exclude it\r\ntherefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and\r\nregulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nHis position, as stated by himself, was, substantially that the\r\nLecompton Pro-Slavery Constitution was a fraud upon the people of\r\nKansas, in that it did not embody the will of that people; and he denied\r\nthe right of Congress to force a Constitution upon an unwilling people\r\n--without regard, on his part, to whether that Constitution allowed or\r\nprohibited Slavery or any other thing, whether good or bad.  He held\r\nthat the people themselves were the sole judges of whether it is good or\r\nbad, and whether desirable or not.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States had in the meantime made a\r\ndecision in a case afterward known as the \"Dred Scott case,\" which was\r\nheld back until after the Presidential election of 1856 had taken place,\r\nand added fuel to the political fire already raging.  Dred Scott was a\r\nNegro Slave.  His owner voluntarily took him first into a Free State,\r\nand afterward into a Territory which came within the Congressional\r\nprohibitive legislation aforesaid.  That decision in brief was\r\nsubstantially that no Negro Slave imported from Africa, nor his\r\ndescendant, can be a citizen of any State within the meaning of the\r\nConstitution; that neither the Congress nor any Territorial Legislature\r\nhas under the Constitution of the United States, the power to exclude\r\nSlavery from any Territory of the United States; and that it is for the\r\nState Courts of the Slave State, into which the negro has been conveyed\r\nby his master, and not for the United States Courts, to decide whether\r\nthat Negro, having been held to actual Slavery in a Free State, has, by\r\nvirtue of residence in such State, himself become Free.\r\n\r\nNow it was, that the meaning of the words, \"subject only to the\r\nConstitution,\" as used in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, began to be\r\ndiscerned.  For if the people of a Territory were to be \"perfectly\r\nfree,\" to deal with Slavery as they chose, \"subject only to the\r\nConstitution\" they were by this Judicial interpretation of that\r\ninstrument \"perfectly free\" to deal with Slavery in any way so long as\r\nthey did not attempt \"to exclude\" it!  The thing was all one-sided.\r\nMr. Douglas's attitude in inventing the peculiar phraseology in the\r\nKansas-Nebraska Act--which to some seemed as if expressly \"made to\r\norder\" for the Dred Scott decision--was criticized with asperity; the\r\npopularity, however, of his courageous stand against President Buchanan\r\non the Lecompton fraud, seemed to make it certain that, his term in the\r\nUnited States Senate being about to expire, he would be overwhelmingly\r\nre-elected to that body.\r\n\r\nBut at this juncture occurred something, which for a long time held the\r\nresult in doubt, and drew the excited attention of the whole Nation to\r\nIllinois as the great battle-ground.  In 1858 a Republican State\r\nConvention was held at Springfield, Ill., which nominated Abraham\r\nLincoln as the Republican candidate for United States Senator to succeed\r\nSenator Douglas in the National Legislature.  On June 16th--after such\r\nnomination--Mr. Lincoln made to the Convention a speech--in which, with\r\ngreat and incisive power, he assailed Mr. Douglas's position as well as\r\nthat of the whole Democratic Pro-Slavery Party, and announced in compact\r\nand cogent phrase, from his own point of view, the attitude, upon the\r\nSlavery question, of the Republican Party.\r\n\r\nIn that remarkable speech--which at once attracted the attention of the\r\nCountry--Mr. Lincoln said: \"We are now far into the fifth year, since a\r\npolicy was initiated with the avowed object, and confident promise, of\r\nputting an end to Slavery agitation.  Under the operation of that\r\npolicy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly\r\naugmented.  In my opinion it will not cease, until a crisis shall have\r\nbeen reached and passed.  'A House divided against itself cannot stand.'\r\nI believe this Government cannot endure permanently half Slave and half\r\nFree.  I do not expect the Union to be dissolved--I do not expect the\r\nHouse to fall--but I do expect it will cease to be divided.  It will\r\nbecome all one thing, or all the other.  Either the opponents of Slavery\r\nwill arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind\r\nshall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction; or its advocates will push it forward, till it shall become\r\nalike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as\r\nSouth.\"\r\n\r\n     [Governor Seward's announcement of an \"irrepressible conflict\" was\r\n     made four months later.]\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to lay bare and closely analyze the history of all\r\nthat had been done, during the four years preceding, to produce the\r\nprevailing condition of things touching human Slavery; describing it as\r\nresulting from that, \"now almost complete legal combination-piece of\r\nmachinery, so to speak--compounded of the Nebraska doctrine and the Dred\r\nScott decision.\"  After stating the several points of that decision, and\r\nthat the doctrine of the \"Sacred right of self-government\" had been\r\nperverted by the Nebraska \"Squatter Sovereignty,\" argument to mean that,\r\n\"if any one man chose to enslave another, no third man shall be allowed\r\nto object,\" he proceeded to show the grounds upon which he charged\r\n\"pre-concert\" among the builders of that machinery.  Said he: \"The people\r\nwere to be left perfectly free, 'subject only to the Constitution.'\r\nWhat the Constitution had to do with it, outsiders could not see.\r\nPlainly enough now, it was an exactly fitted niche for the Dred Scott\r\ndecision to afterward come in and declare the perfect freedom of the\r\npeople to be just no freedom at all.  Why was the amendment, expressly\r\ndeclaring the right of the people, voted down?  Plainly enough now, the\r\nadoption of it would have spoiled the niche for the Dred Scott decision.\r\nWhy was the Court decision held up?  Why even a Senator's individual\r\nopinion withheld, till after the Presidential election?  Plainly enough\r\nnow: the speaking out then would have damaged the 'perfectly free'\r\nargument upon which the election was to be carried.  Why the outgoing\r\nPresident's felicitation on the indorsement?  Why the delay of a\r\nre-argument?  Why the incoming President's advance exhortation in favor of\r\nthe decision?  These things look like the cautious patting and petting\r\nof a spirited horse, preparatory to mounting him, when it is dreaded\r\nthat he may give the rider a fall.  And why the hasty after-indorsement\r\nof the decision, by the President and others?  We cannot absolutely know\r\nthat all these exact adaptations are the result of pre-concert.  But\r\nwhen we see a lot of framed timbers, different portions of which we know\r\nhave been gotten out at different times and places and by different\r\nworkmen--Stephen, Franklin, Roger, and James--[Douglas, Pierce, Taney\r\nand Buchanan.]--for instance--and when we see these timbers joined\r\ntogether, and see they exactly make the frame of a house or a mill, all\r\nthe tenons and mortices exactly fitting, and all the lengths and\r\nproportions of the different pieces exactly adapted to their respective\r\nplaces, and not a piece too many or too few--not omitting even the\r\nscaffolding, or, if a single piece be lacking, we see the place in the\r\nframe exactly fitted and prepared yet to bring such piece in--in such a\r\ncase, we find it impossible not to believe that Stephen and Franklin and\r\nRoger and James all understood one another from the beginning, and all\r\nworked upon a common plan or draft drawn up before the first blow was\r\nstruck.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew attention also to the fact that by the Nebraska Bill the people\r\nof a State, as well as a Territory, were to be left \"perfectly free,\"\r\n\"subject only to the Constitution,\" and that the object of lugging a\r\n\"State\" into this merely Territorial law was to enable the United States\r\nSupreme Court in some subsequent decision to declare, when the public\r\nmind had been sufficiently imbued with Judge Douglas's notion of not\r\ncaring \"whether Slavery be voted up or voted down,\" that \"the\r\nConstitution of the United States does not permit a State to exclude\r\nSlavery from its limits\"--which would make Slavery \"alike lawful in all\r\nthe States.\"  That, he declared to be Judge Douglas's present mission:\r\n--\"His avowed mission is impressing the 'public heart' to care nothing\r\nabout it.\"  Hence Mr. Lincoln urged Republicans to stand by their cause,\r\nwhich must be placed in the hands of its friends, \"Whose hands are free,\r\nwhose hearts are in the work--who do care for the result;\" for he held\r\nthat \"a living dog is better than a dead lion.\"\r\n\r\nOn the evening of July 9, 1858, at Chicago, Mr. Douglas (Mr. Lincoln\r\nbeing present) spoke to an enthusiastic assemblage, which he fitly\r\ndescribed as a \"vast sea of human faces,\" and, after stating that he\r\nregarded \"the Lecompton battle as having been fought and the victory\r\nwon, because the arrogant demand for the admission of Kansas under the\r\nLecompton Constitution unconditionally, whether her people wanted it or\r\nnot, has been abandoned, and the principle which recognizes the right of\r\nthe people to decide for themselves has been submitted in its place,\" he\r\nproceeded to vindicate his position throughout; declared that he opposed\r\n\"the Lecompton monstrosity solely on the ground than it was a violation\r\nof the fundamental principles of free government; on the ground that it\r\nwas not the act and deed of the people of Kansas; that it did not embody\r\ntheir will; that they were averse to it;\" and hence he \"denied the right\r\nof Congress to force it upon them, either as a Free State or a Slave\r\nState.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"I deny the right of Congress to force a Slaveholding State\r\nupon an unwilling people.  I deny their right to force a Free State upon\r\nan unwilling people.  I deny their right to force a good thing upon a\r\npeople who are unwilling to receive it.  The great principle is the\r\nright of every community to judge and decide for itself, whether a thing\r\nis right or wrong, whether it would be good or evil for them to adopt\r\nit; and the right of free action, the right of free thought, the right\r\nof free judgment upon the question is dearer to every true American than\r\nany other under a free Government.  * * *  It is no answer to this\r\nargument to say that Slavery is an evil, and hence should not be\r\ntolerated.  You must allow the people to decide for themselves whether\r\nit is good or evil.\"  He then adverted to the arraignment of himself by\r\nMr. Lincoln, and took direct issue with that gentleman on his\r\nproposition that, as to Freedom and Slavery, \"the Union will become all\r\none thing or all the other;\" and maintained on the contrary, that \"it is\r\nneither desirable nor possible that there should be uniformity in the\r\nlocal institutions and domestic regulations of the different States of\r\nthis Union.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the further proposition of Mr. Lincoln, which Mr. Douglas described\r\nas \"a crusade against the Supreme Court of the United States on account\r\nof the Dred Scott decision,\" and as \"an appeal from the decision\" of\r\nthat Court \"upon this high Constitutional question to a Republican\r\ncaucus sitting in the country,\" he also took \"direct and distinct issue\r\nwith him.\"  To \"the reason assigned by Mr. Lincoln for resisting the\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case * * * because it\r\ndeprives the Negro of the privileges, immunities and rights of\r\ncitizenship which pertain, according to that decision, only to the White\r\nman,\" Mr. Douglas also took exception thus: \"I am free to say to you\r\nthat in my opinion this Government of ours is founded on the White\r\nbasis.  It was made by the White man for the benefit of the White man,\r\nto be administered by White men, in such manner as they should\r\ndetermine.  It is also true that a Negro, an Indian, or any other man of\r\ninferior race to a White man, should be permitted to enjoy, and humanity\r\nrequires that he should have, all the rights, privileges, and immunities\r\nwhich he is capable of exercising consistent with the safety of society.\r\n* * *  But you may ask me what are these rights and these privileges?\r\nMy answer is, that each State must decide for itself the nature and\r\nextent of these rights. * * *  Without indorsing the wisdom of that\r\ndecision, I assert that Virginia has the same power by virtue of her\r\nsovereignty to protect Slavery within her limits, as Illinois has to\r\nbanish it forever from our own borders.  I assert the right of each\r\nState to decide for itself on all these questions, and I do not\r\nsubscribe to the doctrine of my friend, Mr. Lincoln, that uniformity is\r\neither desirable or possible.  I do not acknowledge that the States must\r\nall be Free or must all be Slave.  I do not acknowledge that the Negro\r\nmust have civil and political rights everywhere or nowhere.  * * *  I do\r\nnot acknowledge any of these doctrines of uniformity in the local and\r\ndomestic regulations in the different States.  * * *  Mr. Lincoln goes\r\nfor a warfare upon the Supreme Court of the United States because of\r\ntheir judicial decision in the Dred Scott case.  I yield obedience to\r\nthe decisions in that Court--to the final determination of the highest\r\njudicial tribunal known to our Constitution.  He objects to the Dred\r\nScott decision because it does not put the Negro in the possession of\r\nthe rights of citizenship on an equality with the White man.  I am\r\nopposed to Negro equality.  * * *  I would extend to the Negro, and the\r\nIndian, and to all dependent races every right, every privilege, and\r\nevery immunity consistent with the safety and welfare of the White\r\nraces; but equality they never should have, either political or social,\r\nor in any other respect whatever. * * *  My friends, you see that the\r\nissues are distinctly drawn.\"\r\n\r\nOn the following evening (July 10th) at Chicago, Mr. Lincoln addressed\r\nanother enthusiastic assemblage, in reply to Mr. Douglas; and, after\r\nprotesting against a charge that had been made the previous night by the\r\nlatter, of an \"unnatural and unholy\" alliance between Administration\r\nDemocrats and Republicans to defeat him, as being beyond his own\r\nknowledge and belief, proceeded: \"Popular Sovereignty!  Everlasting\r\nPopular Sovereignty!  Let us for a moment inquire into this vast matter\r\nof Popular Sovereignty.  What is Popular Sovereignty?  We recollect at\r\nan early period in the history of this struggle there was another name\r\nfor the same thing--Squatter Sovereignty.  It was not exactly Popular\r\nSovereignty, but Squatter Sovereignty.  What do those terms mean?  What\r\ndo those terms mean when used now?  And vast credit is taken by our\r\nfriend, the Judge, in regard to his support of it, when he declares the\r\nlast years of his life have been, and all the future years of his life\r\nshall be, devoted to this matter of Popular Sovereignty.  What is it?\r\nWhy it is the Sovereignty of the People!  What was Squatter Sovereignty?\r\nI suppose if it had any significance at all, it was the right of the\r\npeople to govern themselves, to be sovereign in their own affairs while\r\nthey were squatted down in a country not their own--while they had\r\nsquatted on a territory that did not belong to them in the sense that a\r\nState belongs to the people who inhabit it--when it belonged to the\r\nNation--such right to govern themselves was called 'Squatter\r\nSovereignty.'\r\n\r\n\"Now I wish you to mark.  What has become of that Squatter Sovereignty?\r\nWhat has become of it?  Can you get anybody to tell you now that the\r\npeople of a Territory have any authority to govern themselves, in regard\r\nto this mooted question of Slavery, before they form a State\r\nConstitution?  No such thing at all, although there is a general running\r\nfire and although there has been a hurrah made in every speech on that\r\nside, assuming that that policy had given the people of a Territory the\r\nright to govern themselves upon this question; yet the point is dodged.\r\nTo-day it has been decided--no more than a year ago it was decided by\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, and is insisted upon to-day,\r\nthat the people of a Territory have no right to exclude Slavery from a\r\nTerritory, that if any one man chooses to take Slaves into a Territory,\r\nall the rest of the people have no right to keep them out.  This being\r\nso, and this decision being made one of the points that the Judge\r\n(Douglas) approved, * * *  he says he is in favor of it, and sticks to\r\nit, and expects to win his battle on that decision, which says there is\r\nno such thing as Squatter Sovereignty; but that any man may take Slaves\r\ninto a Territory and all the other men in the Territory may be opposed\r\nto it, and yet by reason of the Constitution they cannot prohibit it;\r\nwhen that is so, how much is left of this vast matter of Squatter\r\nSovereignty, I should like to know?  Again, when we get to the question\r\nof the right of the people to form a State Constitution as they please,\r\nto form it with Slavery or without Slavery--if that is anything new, I\r\nconfess I don't know it * * *.\r\n\r\n\"We do not remember that, in that old Declaration of Independence, it is\r\nsaid that 'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are\r\ncreated equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain\r\ninalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit\r\nof happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted\r\namong men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.'\r\nThere, is the origin of Popular Sovereignty.  Who, then, shall come in\r\nat this day and claim that he invented it?  The Lecompton Constitution\r\nconnects itself with this question, for it is in this matter of the\r\nLecompton Constitution that our friend, Judge Douglas, claims such vast\r\ncredit.  I agree that in opposing the Lecompton Constitution, so far as\r\nI can perceive, he was right.  * * *  All the Republicans in the Nation\r\nopposed it, and they would have opposed it just as much without Judge\r\nDouglas's aid as with it.  They had all taken ground against it long\r\nbefore he did.  Why, the reason that he urges against that Constitution,\r\nI urged against him a year before.  I have the printed speech in my hand\r\nnow.  The argument that he makes, why that Constitution should not be\r\nadopted, that the people were not fairly represented nor allowed to\r\nvote, I pointed out in a speech a year ago which I hold in my hand now,\r\nthat no fair chance was to be given to the people.  * * *  The Lecompton\r\nConstitution, as the Judge tells us, was defeated.  The defeat of it was\r\na good thing or it was not.  He thinks the defeat of it was a good\r\nthing, and so do I, and we agree in that.  Who defeated it?  [A voice\r\n--'Judge Douglas.']  Yes, he furnished himself, and if you suppose he\r\ncontrolled the other Democrats that went with him, he furnished three\r\nvotes, while the Republicans furnished twenty.  That is what he did to\r\ndefeat it.  In the House of Representatives he and his friends furnished\r\nsome twenty votes, and the Republicans furnished ninety odd.  Now, who\r\nwas it that did the work?  * * *  Ground was taken against it by the\r\nRepublicans long before Douglas did it.  The proportion of opposition to\r\nthat measure is about five to one.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln then proceeded to take up the issues which Mr. Douglas had\r\njoined with him the previous evening.  He denied that he had said, or\r\nthat it could be fairly inferred from what he had said, in his\r\nSpringfield speech, that he was in favor of making War by the North upon\r\nthe South for the extinction of Slavery, \"or, in favor of inviting the\r\nSouth to a War upon the North, for the purpose of nationalizing\r\nSlavery.\"  Said he: \"I did not even say that I desired that Slavery\r\nshould be put in course of ultimate extinction.  I do say so now,\r\nhowever; so there need be no longer any difficulty about that.  * * *  I\r\nam tolerably well acquainted with the history of the Country and I know\r\nthat it has endured eighty-two years half Slave and half Free.  I\r\nbelieve--and that is what I meant to allude to there--I believe it has\r\nendured, because during all that time, until the introduction of the\r\nNebraska Bill, the public mind did rest all the time in the belief that\r\nSlavery was in course of ultimate extinction.  That was what gave us the\r\nrest that we had through that period of eighty-two years; at least, so I\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\n\"I have always hated Slavery, I think, as much as any Abolitionist--I\r\nhave been an Old Line Whig--I have always hated it, but I have always\r\nbeen quiet about it until this new era of the introduction of the\r\nNebraska Bill began.  I always believed that everybody was against it,\r\nand that it was in course of ultimate extinction.  * * *  The great mass\r\nof the Nation have rested in the belief that Slavery was in course of\r\nultimate extinction.  They had reason so to believe.  The adoption of\r\nthe Constitution and its attendant history led the People to believe so,\r\nand that such was the belief of the framers of the Constitution itself.\r\nWhy did those old men about the time of the adoption of the Constitution\r\ndecree that Slavery should not go into the new territory, where it had\r\nnot already gone?  Why declare that within twenty years the African\r\nSlave Trade, by which Slaves are supplied, might be cut off by Congress?\r\nWhy were all these acts?  I might enumerate more of these acts--but\r\nenough.  What were they but a clear indication that the framers of the\r\nConstitution intended and expected the ultimate extinction of that\r\ninstitution?\r\n\r\n\"And now, when I say, as I said in my speech that Judge Douglas has\r\nquoted from, when I say that I think the opponents of Slavery will\r\nresist the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind\r\nshall rest with the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction,\r\nI only mean to say, that they will place it where the founders of this\r\nGovernment originally placed it.  I have said a hundred times, and I\r\nhave now no inclination to take it back, that I believe there is no\r\nright, and ought to be no inclination in the people of the Free States,\r\nto enter into the Slave States, and interfere with the question of\r\nSlavery at all.  I have said that always; Judge Douglas has heard me say\r\nit--if not quite a hundred times, at least as good as a hundred times;\r\nand when it is said that I am in favor of interfering with Slavery where\r\nit exists, I know that it is unwarranted by anything I have ever\r\nintended, and as I believe, by anything I have ever said.  If, by any\r\nmeans, I have ever used language which could fairly be so construe (as,\r\nhowever, I believe I never have) I now correct it.  So much, then, for\r\nthe inference that Judge Douglas draws, that I am in favor of setting\r\nthe Sections at War with one another.\r\n\r\n\"Now in relation to his inference that I am in favor of a general\r\nconsolidation of all the local institutions of the various States * * *\r\nI have said, very many times in Judge Douglas's hearing, that no man\r\nbelieved more than I in the principle of self-government from beginning\r\nto end.  I have denied that his use of that term applies properly.  But\r\nfor the thing itself, I deny that any man has ever gone ahead of me in\r\nhis devotion to the principle, whatever he may have done in efficiency\r\nin advocating it.  I think that I have said it in your hearing--that I\r\nbelieve each individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with\r\nhimself and the fruit of his labor, so far as it in no wise interferes\r\nwith any other man's rights--that each community, as a State, has a\r\nright to do exactly as it pleases with all the concerns within that\r\nState that interfere with the rights of no other State, and that the\r\nGeneral Government, upon principle, has no right to interfere with\r\nanything other than that general class of things that does concern the\r\nwhole.  I have said that at all times.\r\n\r\n\"I have said, as illustrations, that I do not believe in the right of\r\nIllinois to interfere with the cranberry laws of Indiana, the oyster\r\nlaws of Virginia, or the liquor laws of Maine.  I have said these things\r\nover and over again, and I repeat them here as my sentiments.  * *   *\r\nWhat can authorize him to draw any such inference?  I suppose there\r\nmight be one thing that at least enabled him to draw such an inference\r\nthat would not be true with me or many others, that is, because he looks\r\nupon all this matter of Slavery as an exceedingly little thing--this\r\nmatter of keeping one-sixth of the population of the whole Nation in a\r\nstate of oppression and tyranny unequaled in the World.\r\n\r\n\"He looks upon it as being an exceedingly little thing only equal to the\r\ncranberry laws of Indiana--as something having no moral question in it\r\n--as something on a par with the question of whether a man shall pasture\r\nhis land with cattle, or plant it with tobacco--so little and so small a\r\nthing, that he concludes, if I could desire that anything should be done\r\nto bring about the ultimate extinction of that little thing, I must be\r\nin favor of bringing about an amalgamation of all the other little\r\nthings in the Union.\r\n\r\n\"Now it so happens--and there, I presume, is the foundation of this\r\nmistake--that the Judge thinks thus; and it so happens that there is a\r\nvast portion of the American People that do not look upon that matter as\r\nbeing this very little thing.  They look upon it as a vast moral evil;\r\nthey can prove it as such by the writings of those who gave us the\r\nblessings of Liberty which we enjoy, and that they so looked upon it,\r\nand not as an evil merely confining itself to the States where it is\r\nsituated; while we agree that, by the Constitution we assented to, in\r\nthe States where it exists we have no right to interfere with it,\r\nbecause it is in the Constitution; and we are by both duty and\r\ninclination to stick by that Constitution in all its letter and spirit,\r\nfrom beginning to end.  * * *  The Judge can have no issue with me on a\r\nquestion of establishing uniformity in the domestic regulations of the\r\nStates.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"Another of the issues he says that is to be made with me, is upon his\r\ndevotion to the Dred Scott decision, and my opposition to it.  I have\r\nexpressed heretofore, and I now repeat, my opposition to the Dred Scott\r\ndecision; but I should be allowed to state the nature of that\r\nopposition.  * * *  What is fairly implied by the term Judge Douglas has\r\nused, 'resistance to the decision?'  I do not resist it.  If I wanted to\r\ntake Dred Scott from his master, I would be interfering with property\r\nand that terrible difficulty that Judge Douglas speaks of, of\r\ninterfering with property, would arise.  But I am doing no such thing as\r\nthat, but all that I am doing is refusing to obey it, as a political\r\nrule.  If I were in Congress, and a vote should come up on a question\r\nwhether Slavery should be prohibited in a new Territory, in spite of the\r\nDred Scott decision, I would vote that it should.  That is what I would\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Douglas said last night, that before the decision he might\r\nadvance his opinion, and it might be contrary to the decision when it\r\nwas made; but after it was made, he would abide by it until it was\r\nreversed.  Just so!  We let this property abide by the decision, but we\r\nwill try to reverse that decision.  We will try to put it where Judge\r\nDouglas would not object, for he says he will obey it until it is\r\nreversed.  Somebody has to reverse that decision, since it is made, and\r\nwe mean to reverse it, and we mean to do it peaceably.\r\n\r\n\"What are the uses of decisions of Courts?  They have two uses.  As\r\nrules of property they have two uses.  First, they decide upon the\r\nquestion before the Court.  They decide in this case that Dred Scott is\r\na Slave.  Nobody resists that.  Not only that, but they say to everybody\r\nelse, that persons standing just as Dred Scott stands, are as he is.\r\nThat is, they say that when a question comes up upon another person, it\r\nwill be so decided again, unless the Court decides in another way\r\n--unless the Court overrules its decision.--Well, we mean to do what we\r\ncan to have the Court decide the other way.  That is one thing we mean\r\nto try to do.\r\n\r\n\"The sacredness that Judge Douglas throws around this decision is a\r\ndegree of sacredness that has never before been thrown around any other\r\ndecision.  I have never heard of such a thing.  Why, decisions\r\napparently contrary to that decision, or that good lawyers thought were\r\ncontrary to that decision, have been made by that very Court before.  It\r\nis the first of its kind; it is an astonisher in legal history.  It is a\r\nnew wonder of the world.  It is based upon falsehood in the main as to\r\nthe facts--allegations of facts upon which it stands are not facts at\r\nall in many instances; and no decision made on any question--the first\r\ninstance of a decision made under so many unfavorable circumstances\r\n--thus placed, has ever been held by the profession as law, and it has\r\nalways needed confirmation before the lawyers regarded it as settled\r\nlaw.  But Judge Douglas will have it that all hands must take this\r\nextraordinary decision, made under these extraordinary circumstances,\r\nand give their vote in Congress in accordance with it, yield to it and\r\nobey it in every possible sense.\r\n\r\n\"Circumstances alter cases.  Do not gentlemen remember the case of that\r\nsame Supreme Court, some twenty-five or thirty years ago, deciding that\r\na National Bank was Constitutional?  * * *  The Bank charter ran out,\r\nand a recharter was granted by Congress.  That re-charter was laid\r\nbefore General Jackson.  It was urged upon him, when he denied the\r\nConstitutionality of the Bank, that the Supreme Court had decided that\r\nit was Constitutional; and General Jackson then said that the Supreme\r\nCourt had no right to lay down a rule to govern a co-ordinate branch of\r\nthe Government, the members of which had sworn to support the\r\nConstitution--that each member had sworn to support that Constitution as\r\nhe understood it.  I will venture here to say, that I have heard Judge\r\nDouglas say that he approved of General Jackson for that act.  What has\r\nnow become of all his tirade about 'resistance to the Supreme Court?'\"\r\n\r\nAfter adverting to Judge Douglas's warfare on \"the leaders\" of the\r\nRepublican party, and his desire to have \"it understood that the mass of\r\nthe Republican party are really his friends,\" Mr. Lincoln said: \"If you\r\nindorse him, you tell him you do not care whether Slavery be voted up or\r\ndown, and he will close, or try to close, your mouths with his\r\ndeclaration repeated by the day, the week, the month, and the year.  Is\r\nthat what you mean?  * * *  Now I could ask the Republican party, after\r\nall the hard names that Judge Douglas has called them by, all his\r\nrepeated charges of their inclination to marry with and hug negroes--all\r\nhis declarations of Black Republicanism--by the way, we are improving,\r\nthe black has got rubbed off--but with all that, if he be indorsed by\r\nRepublican votes, where do you stand?  Plainly, you stand ready saddled,\r\nbridled, and harnessed, and waiting to be driven over to the\r\nSlavery-extension camp of the Nation--just ready to be driven over, tied\r\ntogether in a lot--to be driven over, every man with a rope around his\r\nneck, that halter being held by Judge Douglas.  That is the question.\r\nIf Republican men have been in earnest in what they have done, I think\r\nthat they has better not do it.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"We were often--more than once at least--in the course of Judge\r\nDouglas's speech last night, reminded that this Government was made for\r\nWhite men--that he believed it was made for White men.  Well, that is\r\nputting it in a shape in which no one wants to deny it; but the Judge\r\nthen goes into his passion for drawing inferences that are not\r\nwarranted.  I protest, now and forever, against that counterfeit logic\r\nwhich presumes that because I do not want a Negro woman for a Slave I do\r\nnecessarily want her for a wife.  My understanding is that I need not\r\nhave her for either; but, as God has made us separate, we can leave one\r\nanother alone, and do one another much good thereby.  There are White\r\nmen enough to marry all the White women, and enough Black men to marry\r\nall the Black women, and in God's name let them be so married.  The\r\nJudge regales us with the terrible enormities that take place by the\r\nmixture of races; that the inferior race bears the superior down.  Why,\r\nJudge, if we do not let them get together in the Territories, they won't\r\nmix there.\r\n\r\n\" * * * Those arguments that are made, that the inferior race are to be\r\ntreated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying; that as\r\nmuch is to be done for them as their condition will allow--what are\r\nthese arguments?  They are the arguments that Kings have made for\r\nenslaving the People in all ages of the World.  You will find that all\r\nthe arguments in favor of king-craft were of this class; they always\r\nbestrode the necks of the People, not that they wanted to do it, but\r\nbecause the People were better off for being ridden!  That is their\r\nargument, and this argument of the Judge is the same old Serpent that\r\nsays: you work, and I eat; you toil, and I will enjoy the fruits of it.\r\n\r\n\"Turn it whatever way you will--whether it come from the mouth of a\r\nKing, an excuse for enslaving the People of his Country, or from the\r\nmouth of men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another\r\nrace, it is all the same old Serpent; and I hold, if that course of\r\nargumentation that is made for the purpose of convincing the public mind\r\nthat we should not care about this, should be granted, it does not stop\r\nwith the Negro.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to know, taking this old Declaration of Independence,\r\nwhich declares that all men are equal upon principle, and making\r\nexceptions to it, where will it stop?  If one man says it does not mean\r\na Negro, why not say it does not mean some other man?  If that\r\nDeclaration is not the truth, let us get the Statute Book, in which we\r\nfind it, and tear it out!  Who is so bold as to do it?  If it is not\r\ntrue, let us tear it out!\"  [Cries of \"No, no.\"]  \"Let us stick to it\r\nthen; let us stand firmly by it, then.  * * *\r\n\r\n\" * * * The Saviour, I suppose, did not expect that any human creature\r\ncould be perfect as the Father in Heaven; but He said, 'As your Father\r\nin Heaven is perfect, be ye also perfect.'  He set that up as a\r\nstandard, and he who did most toward reaching that standard, attained\r\nthe highest degree of moral perfection.  So I say, in relation to the\r\nprinciple that all men are created equal--let it be as nearly reached as\r\nwe can.  If we cannot give Freedom to every creature, let us do nothing\r\nthat will impose Slavery upon any other creature.  Let us then turn this\r\nGovernment back into the channel in which the framers of the\r\nConstitution originally placed it.  Let us stand firmly by each other.\r\n* * *  Let us discard all this quibbling * * *  and unite as one People\r\nthroughout this Land, until we shall once more stand up declaring that\r\nall men are created equal.\"\r\n\r\nAt Bloomington, July 16th (Mr. Lincoln being present), Judge Douglas\r\nmade another great speech of vindication and attack.  After sketching\r\nthe history of the Kansas-Nebraska struggle, from the introduction by\r\nhimself of the Nebraska Bill in the United States Senate, in 1854, down\r\nto the passage of the \"English\" Bill--which prescribed substantially\r\nthat if the people of Kansas would come in as a Slave-holding State,\r\nthey should be admitted with but 35,000 inhabitants; but if they would\r\ncome in as a Free State, they must have 93,420 inhabitants; which unfair\r\nrestriction was opposed by Judge Douglas, but to which after it became\r\nlaw he \"bowed in deference,\" because whatever decision the people of\r\nKansas might make on the coming third of August would be \"final and\r\nconclusive of the whole question\"--he proceeded to compliment the\r\nRepublicans in Congress, for supporting the Crittenden-Montgomery Bill\r\n--for coming \"to the Douglas platform, abandoning their own, believing\r\n(in the language of the New York Tribune), that under the peculiar\r\ncircumstances they would in that mode best subserve the interests of the\r\nCountry;\" and then again attacked Mr. Lincoln for his \"unholy and\r\nunnatural alliance\" with the Lecompton-Democrats to defeat him, because\r\nof which, said he: \"You will find he does not say a word against the\r\nLecompton Constitution or its supporters.  He is as silent as the grave\r\nupon that subject.  Behold Mr. Lincoln courting Lecompton votes, in\r\norder that he may go to the Senate as the representative of Republican\r\nprinciples!  You know that the alliance exists.  I think you will find\r\nthat it will ooze out before the contest is over.\"  Then with many\r\nhandsome compliments to the personal character of Mr. Lincoln, and\r\ndeclaring that the question for decision was \"whether his principles are\r\nmore in accordance with the genius of our free institutions, the peace\r\nand harmony of the Republic\" than those advocated by himself, Judge\r\nDouglas proceeded to discuss what he described as \"the two points at\r\nissue between Mr. Lincoln and myself.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"Although the Republic has existed from 1789 to this day,\r\ndivided into Free States and Slave States, yet we are told that in the\r\nfuture it cannot endure unless they shall become all Free or all Slave.\r\n* * *  He wishes to go to the Senate of the United States in order to\r\ncarry out that line of public policy which will compel all the States in\r\nthe South to become Free.  How is he going to do it?  Has Congress any\r\npower over the subject of Slavery in Kentucky or Virginia or any other\r\nState of this Union?  How, then, is Mr. Lincoln going to carry out that\r\nprinciple which he says is essential to the existence of this Union, to\r\nwit: That Slavery must be abolished in all the States of the Union or\r\nmust be established in them all?  You convince the South that they must\r\neither establish Slavery in Illinois and in every other Free State, or\r\nsubmit to its abolition in every Southern State and you invite them to\r\nmake a warfare upon the Northern States in order to establish Slavery\r\nfor the sake of perpetuating it at home.  Thus, Mr. Lincoln invites, by\r\nhis proposition, a War of Sections, a War between Illinois and Kentucky,\r\na War between the Free States and the Slave States, a War between the\r\nNorth and South, for the purpose of either exterminating Slavery in\r\nevery Southern State or planting it in every Northern State.  He tells\r\nyou that the safety of the Republic, that the existence of this Union,\r\ndepends upon that warfare being carried on until one Section or the\r\nother shall be entirely subdued.  The States must all be Free or Slave,\r\nfor a house divided against itself cannot stand.  That is Mr. Lincoln's\r\nargument upon that question.  My friends, is it possible to preserve\r\nPeace between the North and the South if such a doctrine shall prevail\r\nin either Section of the Union?\r\n\r\n\"Will you ever submit to a warfare waged by the Southern States to\r\nestablish Slavery in Illinois?  What man in Illinois would not lose the\r\nlast drop of his heart's blood before lie would submit to the\r\ninstitution of Slavery being forced upon us by the other States against\r\nour will?  And if that be true of us, what Southern man would not shed\r\nthe last drop of his heart's blood to prevent Illinois, or any other\r\nNorthern State, from interfering to abolish Slavery in his State?  Each\r\nof these States is sovereign under the Constitution; and if we wish to\r\npreserve our liberties, the reserved rights and sovereignty of each and\r\nevery State must be maintained.  * * *  The difference between Mr.\r\nLincoln and myself upon this point is, that he goes for a combination of\r\nthe Northern States, or the organization of a sectional political party\r\nin the Free States, to make War on the domestic institutions of the\r\nSouthern States, and to prosecute that War until they all shall be\r\nsubdued, and made to conform to such rules as the North shall dictate to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"I am aware that Mr. Lincoln, on Saturday night last, made a speech at\r\nChicago for the purpose, as he said, of explaining his position on this\r\nquestion.  * * *  His answer to this point which I have been arguing,\r\nis, that he never did mean, and that I ought to know that he never\r\nintended to convey the idea, that he wished the people of\r\nthe Free States to enter into the Southern States and interfere with\r\nSlavery.  Well, I never did suppose that he ever dreamed of entering\r\ninto Kentucky, to make War upon her institutions, nor will any\r\nAbolitionist ever enter into Kentucky to wage such War.  Their mode of\r\nmaking War is not to enter into those States where Slavery exists, and\r\nthere interfere, and render themselves responsible for the consequences.\r\nOh, no!  They stand on this side of the Ohio River and shoot across.\r\nThey stand in Bloomington and shake their fists at the people of\r\nLexington; they threaten South Carolina from Chicago.  And they call\r\nthat bravery!  But they are very particular, as Mr. Lincoln says, not to\r\nenter into those States for the purpose of interfering with the\r\ninstitution of Slavery there.  I am not only opposed to entering into\r\nthe Slave States, for the purpose of interfering with their\r\ninstitutions, but I am opposed to a sectional agitation to control the\r\ninstitutions of other States.  I am opposed to organizing a sectional\r\nparty, which appeals to Northern pride, and Northern passion and\r\nprejudice, against Southern institutions, thus stirring up ill feeling\r\nand hot blood between brethren of the same Republic.  I am opposed to\r\nthat whole system of sectional agitation, which can produce nothing but\r\nstrife, but discord, but hostility, and finally disunion.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"I ask Mr. Lincoln how it is that he purposes ultimately to bring about\r\nthis uniformity in each and all the States of the Union?  There is but\r\none possible mode which I can see, and perhaps Mr. Lincoln intends to\r\npursue it; that is, to introduce a proposition into the Senate to change\r\nthe Constitution of the United States in order that all the State\r\nLegislatures may be abolished, State Sovereignty blotted out, and the\r\npower conferred upon Congress to make local laws and establish the\r\ndomestic institutions and police regulations uniformly throughout the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"Are you prepared for such a change in the institutions of your country?\r\nWhenever you shall have blotted out the State Sovereignties, abolished\r\nthe State Legislatures, and consolidated all the power in the Federal\r\nGovernment, you will have established a Consolidated Empire as\r\ndestructive to the Liberties of the People and the Rights of the Citizen\r\nas that of Austria, or Russia, or any other despotism that rests upon\r\nthe neck of the People.  * * *  There is but one possible way in which\r\nSlavery can be abolished, and that is by leaving a State, according to\r\nthe principle of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, perfectly free to form and\r\nregulate its institutions in its own way.  That was the principle upon\r\nwhich this Republic was founded, and it is under the operation of that\r\nprinciple that we have been able to preserve the Union thus far under\r\nits operation.  Slavery disappeared from New Hampshire, from Rhode\r\nIsland, from Connecticut, from New York, from New Jersey, from\r\nPennsylvania, from six of the twelve original Slave-holding States; and\r\nthis gradual system of emancipation went on quietly, peacefully, and\r\nsteadily, so long as we in the Free States minded our own business, and\r\nleft our neighbors alone.\r\n\r\n\"But the moment the Abolition Societies were organized throughout the\r\nNorth, preaching a violent crusade against Slavery in the Southern\r\nStates, this combination necessarily caused a counter-combination in the\r\nSouth, and a sectional line was drawn which was a barrier to any further\r\nemancipation.  Bear in mind that emancipation has not taken place in any\r\none State since the Free Soil Party was organized as a political party\r\nin this country.  Emancipation went on gradually, in State after State,\r\nso long as the Free States were content with managing their own affairs\r\nand leaving the South perfectly free to do as they pleased; but the\r\nmoment the North said we are powerful enough to control you of the\r\nSouth, the moment the North proclaimed itself the determined master of\r\nthe South, that moment the South combined to resist the attack, and thus\r\nsectional parties were formed and gradual emancipation ceased in all the\r\nSlave-holding States.\r\n\r\n\"And yet Mr. Lincoln, in view of these historical facts, proposes to\r\nkeep up this sectional agitation, band all the Northern States together\r\nin one political Party, elect a President by Northern votes alone, and\r\nthen, of course, make a Cabinet composed of Northern men, and administer\r\nthe Government by Northern men only, denying all the Southern States of\r\nthis Union any participation in the administration of affairs\r\nwhatsoever.  I submit to you, my fellow-citizens, whether such a line of\r\npolicy is consistent with the peace and harmony of the Country?  Can the\r\nUnion endure under such a system of policy?  He has taken his position\r\nin favor of sectional agitation and sectional warfare.  I have taken\r\nmine in favor of securing peace, harmony, and good-will among all the\r\nStates, by permitting each to mind its own business, and\r\ndiscountenancing any attempt at interference on the part of one State\r\nwith the domestic concerns of the others.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln tells you that he is opposed to the decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt in the Dred Scott case.  Well, suppose he is; what is he going to\r\ndo about it?  * * * Why, he says he is going to appeal to Congress.  Let\r\nus see how he will appeal to Congress.  He tells us that on the 8th of\r\nMarch, 1820, Congress passed a law called the Missouri Compromise,\r\nprohibiting Slavery forever in all the territory west of the Mississippi\r\nand north of the Missouri line of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes;\r\nthat Dred Scott, a slave in Missouri, was taken by his master to Fort\r\nSnelling, in the present State of Minnesota, situated on the west branch\r\nof the Mississippi River, and consequently in the Territory where\r\nSlavery was prohibited by the Act of 1820; and that when Dred Scott\r\nappealed for his Freedom in consequence of having been taken into that\r\nTerritory, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that Dred\r\nScott did not become Free by being taken into that Territory, but that\r\nhaving been carried back to Missouri, was yet a Slave.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln is going to appeal from that decision and reverse it.  He\r\ndoes not intend to reverse it as to Dred Scott.  Oh, no!  But he will\r\nreverse it so that it shall not stand as a rule in the future.  How will\r\nhe do it?  He says that if he is elected to the Senate he will introduce\r\nand pass a law just like the Missouri Compromise, prohibiting Slavery\r\nagain in all the Territories.  Suppose he does re-enact the same law\r\nwhich the Court has pronounced unconstitutional, will that make it\r\nConstitutional?  * * *  Will it be any more valid?  Will he be able to\r\nconvince the Court that the second Act is valid, when the first is\r\ninvalid and void?  What good does it do to pass a second Act?  Why, it\r\nwill have the effect to arraign the Supreme Court before the People, and\r\nto bring them into all the political discussions of the Country.  Will\r\nthat do any good?  * * *\r\n\r\n\"The functions of Congress are to enact the Statutes, the province of\r\nthe Court is to pronounce upon their validity, and the duty of the\r\nExecutive is to carry the decision into effect when rendered by the\r\nCourt.  And yet, notwithstanding the Constitution makes the decision of\r\nthe Court final in regard to the validity of an Act of Congress, Mr.\r\nLincoln is going to reverse that decision by passing another Act of\r\nCongress.  When he has become convinced of the Folly of the proposition,\r\nperhaps he will resort to the same subterfuge that I have found others\r\nof his Party resort to, which is to agitate and agitate until he can\r\nchange the Supreme Court and put other men in the places of the present\r\nincumbents.\"\r\n\r\nAfter ridiculing this proposition at some length, he proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln is alarmed for fear that, under the Dred Scott decision,\r\nSlavery will go into all the Territories of the United States.  All I\r\nhave to say is that, with or without this decision, Slavery will go just\r\nwhere the People want it, and not an inch further.  * * *  Hence, if the\r\nPeople of a Territory want Slavery, they will encourage it by passing\r\naffirmatory laws, and the necessary police regulations, patrol laws and\r\nSlave Code; if they do not want it, they will withhold that legislation,\r\nand, by withholding it, Slavery is as dead as if it was prohibited by a\r\nConstitutional prohibition, especially if, in addition, their\r\nlegislation is unfriendly, as it would be if they were opposed to it.\"\r\n\r\nThen, taking up what he said was \"Mr. Lincoln's main objection to the\r\nDred Scott decision,\" to wit: \"that that decision deprives the Negro of\r\nthe benefits of that clause of the Constitution of the United States\r\nwhich entitles the citizens of each State to all the privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens of the several States,\" and admitting that such\r\nwould be its effect, Mr. Douglas contended at some length that this\r\nGovernment was \"founded on the White basis\" for the benefit of the\r\nWhites and their posterity.  He did \"not believe that it was the design\r\nor intention of the signers of the Declaration of Independence or the\r\nframes of the Constitution to include Negroes, Indians, or other\r\ninferior races, with White men as citizens;\" nor that the former \"had\r\nany reference to Negroes, when they used the expression that all men\r\nwere created equal,\" nor to \"any other inferior race.\"  He held that,\r\n\"They were speaking only of the White race, and never dreamed that their\r\nlanguage would be construed to apply to the Negro;\" and after ridiculing\r\nthe contrary view, insisted that, \"The history of the Country shows that\r\nneither the signers of the Declaration, nor the Framers of the\r\nConstitution, ever supposed it possible that their language would be\r\nused in an attempt to make this Nation a mixed Nation of Indians,\r\nNegroes, Whites, and Mongrels.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Fathers proceeded on the White basis, making the White people the\r\ngoverning race, but conceding to the Indian and Negro, and all inferior\r\nraces, all the rights and all the privileges they could enjoy consistent\r\nwith the safety of the society in which they lived.  That,\" said he, \"is\r\nmy opinion now.  I told you that humanity, philanthropy, justice, and\r\nsound policy required that we should give the Negro every right, every\r\nprivilege, every immunity consistent with the safety and welfare of the\r\nState.  The question, then, naturally arises, what are those rights and\r\nprivileges, and what is the nature and extent of them?  My answer is,\r\nthat that is a question which each State and each Territory must decide\r\nfor itself.  * * *  I am content with that position.  My friend Lincoln\r\nis not.  * * *  He thinks that the Almighty made the Negro his equal and\r\nhis brother.  For my part I do not consider the Negro any kin to me, nor\r\nto any other White man; but I would still carry my humanity and my\r\nphilanthropy to the extent of giving him every privilege and every\r\nimmunity that he could enjoy, consistent with our own good.\"\r\n\r\nAfter again referring to the principles connected with non-interference\r\nin the domestic institutions of the States and Territories, and to the\r\ndevotion of all his energies to them \"since 1850, when,\" said he, \"I\r\nacted side by side with the immortal Clay and the god-like Webster, in\r\nthat memorable struggle in which Whigs and Democrats united upon a\r\ncommon platform of patriotism and the Constitution, throwing aside\r\npartisan feelings in order to restore peace and harmony to a distracted\r\nCountry\"--he alluded to the death-bed of Clay, and the pledges made by\r\nhimself to both Clay and Webster to devote his own life to the\r\nvindication of the principles of that Compromise of 1850 as a means of\r\npreserving the Union; and concluded with this appeal: \"This Union can\r\nonly be preserved by maintaining the fraternal feeling between the North\r\nand the South, the East and the West.  If that good feeling can be\r\npreserved, the Union will be as perpetual as the fame of its great\r\nfounders.  It can be maintained by preserving the sovereignty of the\r\nStates, the right of each State and each Territory to settle its\r\ndomestic concerns for itself, and the duty of each to refrain from\r\ninterfering with the other in any of its local or domestic institutions.\r\nLet that be done, and the Union will be perpetual; let that be done, and\r\nthis Republic, which began with thirteen States and which now numbers\r\nthirty-two, which when it began, only extended from the Atlantic to the\r\nMississippi, but now reaches to the Pacific, may yet expand, North and\r\nSouth, until it covers the whole Continent, and becomes one vast\r\nocean-bound Confederacy.  Then, my friends, the path of duty, of honor,\r\nof patriotism, is plain.  There are a few simple principles to be\r\npreserved.  Bear in mind the dividing line between State rights and\r\nFederal authority; let us maintain the great principles of Popular\r\nSovereignty, of State rights and of the Federal Union as the\r\nConstitution has made it, and this Republic will endure forever.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next evening, July 17th, at Springfield, both Douglas and Lincoln\r\naddressed separate meetings.\r\n\r\nAfter covering much the same ground with regard to the history of the\r\nKansas-Nebraska struggle and his own attitude upon it, as he did in his\r\nprevious speech, Mr. Douglas declined to comment upon Mr. Lincoln's\r\nintimation of a Conspiracy between Douglas, Pierce, Buchanan, and Taney\r\nfor the passage of the Nebraska Bill, the rendition of the Dred Scott\r\ndecision, and the extension of Slavery, but proceeded to dilate on the\r\n\"uniformity\" issue between himself and Mr. Lincoln, in much the same\r\nstrain as before, tersely summing up with the statement that \"there is a\r\ndistinct issue of principles--principles irreconcilable--between Mr.\r\nLincoln and myself.  He goes for consolidation and uniformity in our\r\nGovernment.  I go for maintaining the Confederation of the Sovereign\r\nStates under the Constitution, as our fathers made it, leaving each\r\nState at liberty to manage its own affairs and own internal\r\ninstitutions.\"\r\n\r\nHe then ridiculed, at considerable length, Mr. Lincoln's proposed\r\nmethods of securing a reversal by the United States Supreme Court of the\r\nDred Scott decision--especially that of an \"appeal to the People to\r\nelect a President who will appoint judges who will reverse the Dred\r\nScott decision,\" which he characterized as \"a proposition to make that\r\nCourt the corrupt, unscrupulous tool of a political party,\" and asked,\r\n\"when we refuse to abide by Judicial decisions, what protection is there\r\nleft for life and property?  To whom shall you appeal?  To mob law, to\r\npartisan caucuses, to town meetings, to revolution?  Where is the remedy\r\nwhen you refuse obedience to the constituted authorities?\"  In other\r\nrespects the speech was largely a repetition of his Bloomington speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln in his speech, the same night, at Springfield, opened by\r\ncontrasting the disadvantages under which, by reason of an unfair\r\napportionment of State Legislative representation and otherwise, the\r\nRepublicans of Illinois labored in this fight.  Among other\r\ndisadvantages--whereby he said the Republicans were forced \"to fight\r\nthis battle upon principle and upon principle alone\"--were those which\r\nhe said arose \"out of the relative positions of the two persons who\r\nstand before the State as candidates for the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"Senator Douglas is of world-wide renown.  All the anxious\r\npoliticians of his Party, or who have been of his Party for years past,\r\nhave been looking upon him as certainly, at no distant day, to be the\r\nPresident of the United States.  They have seen in his round, jolly,\r\nfruitful face, Post-offices, Land-offices, Marshalships, and Cabinet\r\nappointments, Chargeships and Foreign Missions, bursting and sprouting\r\nout in wonderful exuberance, ready to be laid hold of by their greedy\r\nhands.  And as they have been gazing upon this attractive picture so\r\nlong, they cannot, in the little distraction that has taken place in the\r\nparty, bring themselves to give up the charming hope; but with greedier\r\nanxiety they rush about him, sustain him, and give him marches,\r\ntriumphal entries, and receptions, beyond what even in the days of his\r\nhighest prosperity they could have brought about in his favor.  On the\r\ncontrary, nobody has ever expected me to be President.  In my poor,\r\nlean, lank face, nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nThen he described the main points of Senator Douglas's plan of campaign\r\nas being not very numerous.  \"The first,\" he said, \"is Popular\r\nSovereignty.  The second and third are attacks upon my speech made on\r\nthe 16th of June.  Out of these three points-drawing within the range of\r\nPopular Sovereignty the question of the Lecompton Constitution--he makes\r\nhis principal assault.  Upon these his successive speeches are\r\nsubstantially one and the same.\"  Touching the first point, \"Popular\r\nSovereignty\"--\"the great staple\" of Mr. Douglas's campaign--Mr. Lincoln\r\naffirmed that it was \"the most arrant Quixotism that was ever enacted\r\nbefore a community.\"\r\n\r\nHe said that everybody understood that \"we have not been in a\r\ncontroversy about the right of a People to govern themselves in the\r\nordinary matters of domestic concern in the States and Territories;\"\r\nthat, \"in this controversy, whatever has been said has had reference to\r\nthe question of Negro Slavery;\" and \"hence,\" said he, \"when hereafter I\r\nspeak of Popular Sovereignty, I wish to be understood as applying what I\r\nsay to the question of Slavery only; not to other minor domestic matters\r\nof a Territory or a State.\"\r\n\r\nHaving cleared away the cobwebs, Mr. Lincoln proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Does Judge Douglas, when he says that several of the past years of his\r\nlife have been devoted to the question of 'Popular Sovereignty' * * *\r\nmean to say that he has been devoting his life to securing the People of\r\nthe Territories the right to exclude Slavery from the Territories?  If\r\nhe means so to say, he means to deceive; because he and every one knows\r\nthat the decision of the Supreme Court, which he approves, and makes\r\nspecial ground of attack upon me for disapproving, forbids the People of\r\na Territory to exclude Slavery.\r\n\r\n\"This covers the whole ground from the settlement of a Territory till it\r\nreaches the degree of maturity entitling it to form a State\r\nConstitution.  * * *  This being so, the period of time from the first\r\nsettlement of a Territory till it reaches the point of forming a State\r\nConstitution, is not the thing that the Judge has fought for, or is\r\nfighting for; but, on the contrary, he has fought for, and is fighting\r\nfor, the thing that annihilates and crushes out that same Popular\r\nSovereignty.  Well, so much being disposed of, what is left?  Why, he is\r\ncontending for the right of the People, when they come to make a State\r\nConstitution, to make it for themselves, and precisely as best suits\r\nthemselves.  I say again, that is Quixotic.  I defy contradiction when I\r\ndeclare that the Judge can find no one to oppose him on that\r\nproposition.  I repeat, there is nobody opposing that proposition on\r\nprinciple.  * * *  Nobody is opposing, or has opposed, the right of the\r\nPeople when they form a State Constitution, to form it for themselves.\r\nMr. Buchanan and his friends have not done it; they, too, as well as the\r\nRepublicans and the Anti-Lecompton Democrats, have not done it; but on\r\nthe contrary, they together have insisted on the right of the People to\r\nform a Constitution for themselves.  The difference between the Buchanan\r\nmen, on the one hand, and the Douglas men and the Republicans, on the\r\nother, has not been on a question of principle, but on a question of\r\nfact * * * whether the Lecompton Constitution had been fairly formed by\r\nthe People or not.  * * *  As to the principle, all were agreed.\r\n\r\n\"Judge Douglas voted with the Republicans upon that matter of fact.  He\r\nand they, by their voices and votes, denied that it was a fair emanation\r\nof the People.  The Administration affirmed that it was.  * * *  This\r\nbeing so, what is Judge Douglas going to spend his life for?  Is he\r\ngoing to spend his life in maintaining a principle that no body on earth\r\nopposes?  Does he expect to stand up in majestic dignity and go through\r\nhis apotheosis and become a god, in the maintaining of a principle which\r\nneither man nor mouse in all God's creation is opposing?\"\r\n\r\nAfter ridiculing the assumption that Judge Douglas was entitled to all\r\nthe credit for the defeat of the Lecompton Constitution in the House of\r\nRepresentatives--when the defeating vote numbered 120, of which 6 were\r\nAmericans, 20 Douglas (or Anti-Lecompton) Democrats, and 94 Republicans\r\n--and hinting that perhaps he placed \"his superior claim to credit, on\r\nthe ground that he performed a good act which was never expected of\r\nhim,\" or \"upon the ground of the parable of the lost sheep,\" of which it\r\nhad been said, \"that there was more rejoicing over the one sheep that\r\nwas lost and had been found, than over the ninety and nine in the fold\r\n--\" he added: \"The application is made by the Saviour in this parable,\r\nthus: 'Verily, I say unto you, there is more rejoicing in Heaven over\r\none sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just persons that\r\nneed no repentance.'  And now if the Judge claims the benefit of this\r\nparable, let him repent.  Let him not come up here and say: 'I am the\r\nonly just person; and you are the ninety-nine sinners!'  Repentance\r\nbefore forgiveness is a provision of the Christian system, and on that\r\ncondition alone will the Republicans grant his forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\nAfter complaining that Judge Douglas misrepresented his attitude as\r\nindicated in his 16th of June speech at Springfield, in charging that he\r\ninvited \"a War of Sections;\"--that he proposed that \"all the local\r\ninstitutions of the different States shall become consolidated and\r\nuniform,\" Mr. Lincoln denied that that speech could fairly bear such\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nIn that speech he (Mr. L.) had simply expressed an expectation that\r\n\"either the opponents of Slavery will arrest the further spread of it,\r\nand place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is\r\nin the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it\r\nforward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well\r\nas new, North as well as South.\"  Since then, at Chicago, he had also\r\nexpressed a \"wish to see the spread of Slavery arrested, and to see it\r\nplaced where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the\r\ncourse of ultimate extinction\"--and, said he: \"I said that, because I\r\nsupposed, when the public mind shall rest in that belief, we shall have\r\nPeace on the Slavery question.  I have believed--and now believe--the\r\npublic mind did rest on that belief up to the introduction of the\r\nNebraska Bill.  Although I have ever been opposed to Slavery, so far I\r\nrested in the hope and belief that it was in the course of ultimate\r\nextinction.  For that reason, it had been a minor question with me.  I\r\nmight have been mistaken; but I had believed, and now believe, that the\r\nwhole public mind, that is, the mind of the great majority, had rested\r\nin that belief up to the Repeal of the Missouri Compromise.  But upon\r\nthat event, I became convinced that either I had been resting in a\r\ndelusion, or the institution was being placed on a new basis--a basis\r\nfor making it Perpetual, National, and Universal.  Subsequent events\r\nhave greatly confirmed me in that belief.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that Bill to be the beginning of a Conspiracy for that\r\npurpose.  So believing, I have since then considered that question a\r\nparamount one.  So believing, I thought the public mind would never rest\r\ntill the power of Congress to restrict the spread of it shall again be\r\nacknowledged and exercised on the one hand, or, on the other, all\r\nresistance be entirely crushed out.  I have expressed that opinion and I\r\nentertain it to-night.\"\r\n\r\nHaving given some pieces of evidence in proof of the  \"tendency,\" he had\r\ndiscovered, to the Nationalization of Slavery in these States, Mr.\r\nLincoln continued: \"And now, as to the Judge's inference, that because I\r\nwish to see Slavery placed in the course of ultimate extinction--placed\r\nwhere our fathers originally placed it--I wish to annihilate the State\r\nLegislatures--to force cotton to grow upon the tops of the Green\r\nMountains--to freeze ice in Florida--to cut lumber on the broad Illinois\r\nprairies--that I am in favor of all these ridiculous and impossible\r\nthings!  It seems to me it is a complete answer to all this, to ask if,\r\nwhen Congress did have the fashion of restricting Slavery from Free\r\nTerritory; when Courts did have the fashion of deciding that taking a\r\nSlave into a Free, Country made him Free--I say it is a sufficient\r\nanswer to ask, if any of this ridiculous nonsense, about consolidation\r\nand uniformity, did actually follow?  Who heard of any such thing,\r\nbecause of the Ordinance of '87? because of the Missouri Restriction\r\nbecause of the numerous Court decisions of that character?\r\n\r\n\"Now, as to the Dred Scott decision; for upon that he makes his last\r\npoint at me.  He boldly takes ground in favor of that decision.  This is\r\none-half the onslaught and one-third of the entire plan of the campaign.\r\nI am opposed to that decision in a certain sense, but not in the sense\r\nwhich he puts on it.  I say that in so far as it decided in favor of\r\nDred Scott's master, and against Dred Scott and his family, I do not\r\npropose to disturb or resist the decision.  I never have proposed to do\r\nany such thing.  I think, that in respect for judicial authority, my\r\nhumble history would not suffer in comparison with that of Judge\r\nDouglas.  He would have the citizen conform his vote to that decision;\r\nthe member of Congress, his; the President, his use of the veto power.\r\nHe would make it a rule of political action for the People and all the\r\ndepartments of the Government.  I would not.  By resisting it as a\r\npolitical rule, I disturb no right of property, create no disorder,\r\nexcite no mobs.\"\r\n\r\nAfter quoting from a letter of Mr. Jefferson (vol. vii., p. 177, of his\r\nCorrespondence,) in which he held that \"to consider the judges as the\r\nultimate arbiters of all Constitutional questions,\" is \"a very dangerous\r\ndoctrine indeed; and one which would place us under the despotism of an\r\nOligarchy,\" Mr. Lincoln continued: \"Let us go a little further.  You\r\nremember we once had a National Bank.  Some one owed the Bank a debt; he\r\nwas sued, and sought to avoid payment on the ground that the Bank was\r\nunconstitutional.  The case went to the Supreme Court, and therein it\r\nwas decided that the Bank was Constitutional.  The whole Democratic\r\nparty revolted against that decision.  General Jackson himself asserted\r\nthat he, as President, would not be bound to hold a National Bank to be\r\nConstitutional, even though the Court had decided it to be so.  He fell\r\nin, precisely, with the view of Mr. Jefferson, and acted upon it under\r\nhis official oath, in vetoing a charter for a National Bank.\r\n\r\n\"The declaration that Congress does not possess this Constitutional\r\npower to charter a Bank, has gone into the Democratic platform, at their\r\nNational Conventions, and was brought forward and reaffirmed in their\r\nlast Convention at Cincinnati.  They have contended for that\r\ndeclaration, in the very teeth of the Supreme Court, for more than a\r\nquarter of a century.  In fact, they have reduced the decision to an\r\nabsolute nullity.  That decision, I repeat, is repudiated in the\r\nCincinnati platform; and still, as if to show that effrontery can go no\r\nfurther, Judge Douglas vaunts in the very speeches in which he denounces\r\nme for opposing the Dred Scott decision, that he stands on the\r\nCincinnati platform.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I wish to know what the Judge can charge upon me, with respect to\r\ndecisions of the Supreme Court, which does not lie in all its length,\r\nbreadth, and proportions, at his own door?  The plain truth is simply\r\nthis: Judge Douglas is for Supreme Court decisions when he likes, and\r\nagainst them when he does not like them.  He is for the Dred Scott\r\ndecision because it tends to Nationalize Slavery--because it is a part\r\nof the original combination for that object.  It so happens, singularly\r\nenough, that I never stood opposed to a decision of the Supreme Court\r\ntill this.  On the contrary, I have no recollection that he was ever\r\nparticularly in favor of one till this.  He never was in favor of any,\r\nnor (I) opposed to any, till the present one, which helps to Nationalize\r\nSlavery.  Free men of Sangamon--Free men of Illinois, Free men\r\neverywhere--judge ye between him and me, upon this issue!\r\n\r\n\"He says this Dred Scott case is a very small matter at\r\nmost--that it has no practical effect; that at best, or rather I suppose\r\nat worst, it is but an abstraction.  * * *  How has the planting of\r\nSlavery in new countries always been effected?  It has now been decided\r\nthat Slavery cannot be kept out of our new Territories by any legal\r\nmeans.  In what do our new Territories now differ in this respect from\r\nthe old Colonies when Slavery was first planted within them?\r\n\r\n\"It was planted, as Mr. Clay once declared, and as history proves true,\r\nby individual men in spite of the wishes of the people; the\r\nMother-Government refusing to prohibit it, and withholding from the\r\nPeople of the Colonies the authority to prohibit it for themselves.  Mr.\r\nClay says this was one of the great and just causes of complaint against\r\nGreat Britain by the Colonies, and the best apology we can now make for\r\nhaving the institution amongst us.  In that precise condition our\r\nNebraska politicians have at last succeeded in placing our own new\r\nTerritories; the Government will not prohibit Slavery within them, nor\r\nallow the People to prohibit it.\"\r\n\r\nAlluding to that part of Mr. Douglas's speech the previous night\r\ntouching the death-bed scene of Mr. Clay, with Mr. Douglas's promise to\r\ndevote the remainder of his life to \"Popular Sovereignty\"--and to his\r\nrelations with Mr. Webster--Mr. Lincoln said: \"It would be amusing, if\r\nit were not disgusting, to see how quick these Compromise breakers\r\nadminister on the political effects of their dead adversaries.  If I\r\nshould be found dead to-morrow morning, nothing but my insignificance\r\ncould prevent a speech being made on my authority, before the end of\r\nnext week.  It so happens that in that 'Popular Sovereignty' with which\r\nMr. Clay was identified, the Missouri Compromise was expressly reserved;\r\nand it was a little singular if Mr. Clay cast his mantle upon Judge\r\nDouglas on purpose to have that Compromise repealed.  Again, the Judge\r\ndid not keep faith with Mr. Clay when he first brought in the Nebraska\r\nBill.  He left the Missouri Compromise unrepealed, and in his report\r\naccompanying the Bill, he told the World he did it on purpose.  The\r\nmanes of Mr. Clay must have been in great agony, till thirty days later,\r\nwhen 'Popular Sovereignty' stood forth in all its glory.\"\r\n\r\nTouching Mr. Douglas's allegations of Mr. Lincoln's disposition to make\r\nNegroes equal with the Whites, socially and politically, the latter\r\nsaid: \"My declarations upon this subject of Negro Slavery may be\r\nmisrepresented, but cannot be misunderstood.  I have said that I do not\r\nunderstand the Declaration (of Independence) to mean that all men were\r\ncreated equal in all respects.  They are not equal in color; but I\r\nsuppose that it does mean to declare that all men are equal in some\r\nrespects; they are equal in their right to 'Life, Liberty, and the\r\npursuit of Happiness.'  Certainly the Negro is not our equal in color\r\n--perhaps not in many other respects; still, in the right to put into his\r\nmouth the bread that his own hands have earned, he is the equal of every\r\nother man, White or Black.  In pointing out that more has been given\r\nyou, you cannot be justified in taking away the little which has been\r\ngiven him.  All I ask for the Negro is that if you do not like him, let\r\nhim alone.  If God gave him but little, that little let him enjoy.\r\n\r\n\"The framers of the Constitution,\" continued Mr. Lincoln, \"found the\r\ninstitution of Slavery amongst their other institutions at the time.\r\nThey found that by an effort to eradicate it, they might lose much of\r\nwhat they had already gained.  They were obliged to bow to the\r\nnecessity.  They gave Congress power to abolish the Slave Trade at the\r\nend of twenty years.  They also prohibited it in the Territories where\r\nit did not exist.  They did what they could, and yielded to the\r\nnecessity for the rest.  I also yield to all which follows from that\r\nnecessity.  What I would most desire would be the separation of the\r\nWhite and Black races.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln closed his speech by referring to the \"New Departure\" of\r\nthe Democracy--to the charge he had made, in his 16th of June speech,\r\ntouching \"the existence of a Conspiracy to Perpetuate and Nationalize\r\nSlavery\"--which Mr. Douglas had not contradicted--and, said he, \"on his\r\nown tacit admission I renew that charge.  I charge him with having been\r\na party to that Conspiracy, and to that deception, for the sole purpose\r\nof Nationalizing Slavery.\"\r\n\r\nThis closed the series of preliminary speeches in the canvass.  But they\r\nonly served to whet the moral and intellectual and political appetite of\r\nthe public for more.  It was generally conceded that, at last, in the\r\nperson of Mr. Lincoln, the \"Little Giant\" had met his match.\r\n\r\nOn July 24, Mr. Lincoln opened a correspondence with Mr. Douglas,\r\nwhich eventuated in an agreement between them, July 31st, for\r\njoint-discussions, to take place at Ottawa, Freeport, Jonesboro,\r\nCharleston, Galesburgh, Quincy, and Alton, on fixed dates in August,\r\nSeptember and October--at Ottawa, Mr. Douglas to open and speak one\r\nhour, Mr. Lincoln to have an hour and a half in reply, and Mr. Douglas\r\nto close in a half hour's speech; at Freeport, Mr. Lincoln to open and\r\nspeak for one hour, Mr. Douglas to take the next hour and a half in\r\nreply, and Mr. Lincoln to have the next half hour to close; and so on,\r\nalternating at each successive place, making twenty-one hours of joint\r\npolitical debate.\r\n\r\nTo these absorbingly interesting discussions, vast assemblages listened\r\nwith breathless attention; and to the credit of all parties be it said,\r\nwith unparalleled decorum.  The People evidently felt that the greatest\r\nof all political principles--that of Human Liberty--was hanging on the\r\nissue of this great political contest between intellectual giants, thus\r\nopenly waged before the World--and they accordingly rose to the dignity\r\nand solemnity of the occasion, vindicating by their very example the\r\nsacredness with which the Right of Free Speech should be regarded at all\r\ntimes and everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                   THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST OF 1860\r\n                        THE CRISIS APPROACHING.\r\n\r\nThe immediate outcome of the remarkable joint-debate between the two\r\nintellectual giants of Illinois was, that while the popular vote stood\r\n124,698 for Lincoln, to 121,130 for Douglas--showing a victory for\r\nLincoln among the People--yet, enough Douglas-Democrats were elected to\r\nthe Legislature, when added to those of his friends in the Illinois\r\nSenate, who had been elected two years before, and \"held over,\" to give\r\nhim, in all, 54 members of both branches of the Legislature on joint\r\nballot, against 46 for Mr. Lincoln.  Lincoln had carried the people, but\r\nDouglas had secured the Senatorial prize for which they had striven--and\r\nby that Legislative vote was elected to succeed himself in the United\r\nStates Senate.  This result was trumpeted throughout the Union as a\r\ngreat Douglas victory.\r\n\r\nDuring the canvass of Illinois, Douglas's friends had seen to it that\r\nnothing on their part should be wanting to secure success.  What with\r\nspecial car trains, and weighty deputations, and imposing processions,\r\nand flag raisings, the inspiration of music, the booming of cannon, and\r\nthe eager shouts of an enthusiastic populace, his political journey\r\nthrough Illinois had been more like a Royal Progress than anything the\r\nCountry had yet seen; and now that his reelection was accomplished, they\r\nproposed to make the most of it--to extend, as it were, the sphere of\r\nhis triumph, or vindication, so that it would include not the State\r\nalone, but the Nation--and thus so accentuate and enhance his\r\navailability as a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination\r\nof 1860, as to make his nomination and election to the Presidency of the\r\nUnited States an almost foregone conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe programme was to raise so great a popular tidal-wave in his\r\ninterest, as would bear him irresistibly upon its crest to the White\r\nHouse.  Accordingly, as the idol of the Democratic popular heart,\r\nDouglas, upon his return to the National Capital, was triumphantly\r\nreceived by the chief cities of the Mississippi and the Atlantic\r\nsea-board.  Hailed as victor in the great political contest in Illinois\r\n--upon the extended newspaper reports of which, the absorbed eyes of the\r\nentire nation, for months, had greedily fed--Douglas was received with\r\nmuch ostentation and immense enthusiasm at St. Louis, Memphis, New\r\nOrleans, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington.  Like the\r\n\"Triumphs\" decreed by Rome, in her grandest days, to the greatest of her\r\nvictorious heroes, Douglas's return was a series of magnificent popular\r\novations.\r\n\r\nIn a speech made two years before this period, Mr. Lincoln, while\r\ncontrasting his own political career with that of Douglas, and modestly\r\ndescribing his own as \"a flat failure\" had said: \"With him it has been\r\none of splendid success.  His name fills the Nation, and is not unknown\r\neven in foreign lands.  I affect no contempt for the high eminence he\r\nhas reached.  So reached, that the oppressed of my species might have\r\nshared with me in the elevation, I would rather stand on that eminence\r\nthan wear the richest crown that ever pressed a monarch's brow.\"  And\r\nnow the star of Douglas had reached a higher altitude, nearing its\r\nmeridian splendor.  He had become the popular idol of the day.\r\n\r\nBut Douglas's partial victory--if such it was--so far from settling the\r\npublic mind and public conscience, had the contrary effect.  It added to\r\nthe ferment which the Pro-Slavery Oligarchists of the South--and\r\nespecially those of South Carolina--were intent upon increasing, until\r\nso grave and serious a crisis should arrive as would, in their opinion,\r\nfurnish a justifiable pretext in the eyes of the World for the\r\ncontemplated Secession of the Slave States from the Union.\r\n\r\nUnder the inspiration of the Slave Power, and in the direct line of the\r\nDred Scott decision, and of the \"victorious\" doctrine of Senator\r\nDouglas, which he held not inconsistent therewith, that the people of\r\nany Territory of the United States could do as they pleased as to the\r\ninstitution of Slavery within their own limits, and if they desired the\r\ninstitution, they had the right by local legislation to \"protect and\r\nencourage it,\" the Legislature of the Territory of New Mexico at once\r\n(1859) proceeded to enact a law \"for the protection of property in\r\nSlaves,\" and other measures similar to the prevailing Slave Codes in the\r\nSouthern States.\r\n\r\nThe aggressive attitude of the South--as thus evidenced anew--naturally\r\nstirred, to their very core, the Abolition elements of the North; on the\r\nother hand, the publication of Hinton Rowan Helper's \"Impending Crisis,\"\r\nwhich handled the Slavery question without gloves, and supported its\r\nviews with statistics which startled the Northern mind, together with\r\nits alleged indorsement by the leading Republicans of the North,\r\nexasperated the fiery Southrons to an intense degree.  Nor was the\r\ncapture, in October, 1859, of Harper's Ferry, Virginia, by John Brown\r\nand his handful of Northern Abolitionist followers, and his subsequent\r\nexecution in Virginia, calculated to allay the rapidly intensifying\r\nfeeling between the Freedom-loving North and the Slaveholding South.\r\nWhen, therefore, the Congress met, in December, 1859, the sectional\r\nwrath of the Country was reflected in the proceedings of both branches\r\nof that body, and these again reacted upon the People of both the\r\nNorthern and Southern States, until the fires of Slavery Agitation were\r\nstirred to a white heat.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of feeling in the House at this time, was shown, in part,\r\nby the fact that not until the 1st of February, 1860, was it able, upon\r\na forty-fourth ballot, to organize by the election of a Speaker, and\r\nthat from the day of its meeting on the 5th of December, 1859, up to\r\nsuch organization, it was involved in an incessant and stormy wrangle\r\nupon the Slavery question.\r\n\r\nSo also in the Democratic Senate, the split in the Democratic Party,\r\nbetween the Lecompton and Anti-Lecompton Democracy, was widened, at the\r\nsame time that the Republicans of the North were further irritated, by\r\nthe significantly decisive passage of a series of resolutions proposed\r\nby Jefferson Davis, which, on the one hand, purposely and deliberately\r\nknifed Douglas's \"Popular Sovereignty\" doctrine and read out of the\r\nParty all who believed in it, by declaring \"That neither Congress nor a\r\nTerritorial Legislature, whether by direct legislation, or legislation\r\nof an indirect and unfriendly character, possesses power to annul or\r\nimpair the Constitutional right of any citizen of the United States to\r\ntake his Slave-property into the common Territories, and there hold and\r\nenjoy the same while the Territorial condition remains,\" and, on the\r\nother, purposely and deliberately slapped in the face the Republicans of\r\nthe North, by declaring-among other things \"That in the adoption of the\r\nFederal Constitution, the States adopting the same, acted severally as\r\nFree and Independent sovereignties, delegating a portion of their powers\r\nto be exercised by the Federal Government for the increased security of\r\neach against dangers, domestic as well as foreign; and that any\r\nintermeddling by any one or more States or by a combination of their\r\ncitizens, with the domestic institutions of the others, on any pretext\r\nwhatever, political, moral, or religious, with a view to their\r\ndisturbance or subversion, is in violation of the Constitution,\r\ninsulting to the States so interfered with, endangers their domestic\r\npeace and tranquillity--objects for which the Constitution was formed\r\n--and, by necessary consequence, tends to weaken and destroy the Union\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of these resolutions declared Negro Slavery to be recognized in\r\nthe Constitution, and that all \"open or covert attacks thereon with a\r\nview to its overthrow,\" made either by the Non-Slave-holding States or\r\ntheir citizens, violated the pledges of the Constitution, \"are a\r\nmanifest breach of faith, and a violation of the most solemn\r\nobligations.\"\r\n\r\nThis last was intended as a blow at the Freedom of Speech and of the\r\nPress in the North; and only served, as was doubtless intended, to still\r\nmore inflame Northern public feeling, while at the same time endeavoring\r\nto place the arrogant and aggressive Slave Power in an attitude of\r\ninjured innocence.  In short, the time of both Houses of Congress was\r\nalmost entirely consumed during the Session of 1859-60 in the heated,\r\nand sometimes even furious, discussion of the Slavery question; and\r\neverywhere, North and South, the public mind was not alone deeply\r\nagitated, but apprehensive that the Union was founded not upon a rock,\r\nbut upon the crater of a volcano, whose long-smouldering energies might\r\nat any moment burst their confines, and reduce it to ruin and\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of April, 1860, the Democratic National Convention met at\r\nCharleston, South Carolina.  It was several days after the permanent\r\norganization of the Convention before the Committee on Resolutions\r\nreported to the main body, and not until the 30th of April did it reach\r\na vote upon the various reports, which had in the meantime been\r\nmodified.  The propositions voted upon were three:\r\n\r\nFirst, The Majority Report of the Committee, which reaffirmed the\r\nCincinnati platform of 1856--with certain \"explanatory\" resolutions\r\nadded, which boldly proclaimed: \"That the Government of a Territory\r\norganized by an Act of Congress, is provisional and temporary; and,\r\nduring its existence, all citizens of the United States have an equal\r\nright to settle with their property in the Territory, without their\r\nrights, either of person or property, being destroyed or impaired by\r\nCongressional or Territorial Legislation;\" that \"it is the duty of the\r\nFederal Government, in all its departments, to protect, when necessary,\r\nthe rights of persons and property in the Territories, and wherever else\r\nits Constitutional authority extends;\" that \"when the settlers in a\r\nTerritory, having an adequate population, form a State Constitution, the\r\nright of Sovereignty commences, and, being consummated by admission into\r\nthe Union, they stand on an equal footing with the people of other\r\nStates, and the State thus organized ought to be admitted into the\r\nFederal Union, whether its Constitution prohibits or recognizes the\r\ninstitution of Slavery;\" and that \"the enactments of State Legislatures\r\nto defeat the faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Law, are hostile\r\nin character, subversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in\r\neffect.\"  The resolutions also included a declaration in favor of the\r\nacquisition of Cuba, and other comparatively minor matters.\r\n\r\nSecond, The Minority Report of the Committee, which, after re-affirming\r\nthe Cincinnati platform, declared that \"Inasmuch as differences of\r\nopinion exist in the Democratic party as to the nature and extent of the\r\npowers of a Territorial Legislature, and as to the powers and duties of\r\nCongress, under the Constitution of the United States, over the\r\ninstitution of Slavery within the Territories * * * the Democratic Party\r\nwill abide by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States on\r\nthe questions of Constitutional law.\"\r\n\r\nThird, The recommendation of Benjamin F. Butler, that the platform\r\nshould consist simply of a re-affirmation of the Cincinnati platform,\r\nand not another word.\r\n\r\nThe last proposition was first voted on, and lost, by 105 yeas to 198\r\nnays.  The Minority platform was then adopted by 165 yeas to 138 nays.\r\n\r\nThe aggressive Slave-holders (Majority) platform, and the Butler\r\nCompromise do-nothing proposition, being both defeated, and the Douglas\r\n(Minority) platform adopted, the Alabama delegation, under instructions\r\nfrom their State Convention to withdraw in case the National Convention\r\nrefused to adopt radical Territorial Pro-Slavery resolutions, at once\r\npresented a written protest and withdrew from the Convention, and were\r\nfollowed, in rapid succession, by; the delegates from Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana (all but two), South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Arkansas (in\r\npart), Delaware (mostly), and Georgia (mostly)--the seceding delegates\r\nafterwards organizing in another Hall, adopting the above Majority\r\nplatform, and after a four days' sitting, adjourning to meet at\r\nRichmond, Virginia, on the 11th of June.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Regular Democratic National Convention had proceeded to\r\nballot for President--after adopting the two-thirds rule.  Thirty-seven\r\nballots having been cast, that for Stephen A. Douglas being, on the\r\nthirty-seventh, 151, the Convention, on the 3d of May, adjourned to meet\r\nagain at Baltimore, June 18th.\r\n\r\nAfter re-assembling, and settling contested election cases, the\r\ndelegates (in whole or in part) from Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nTennessee, California, Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland and Massachusetts,\r\nwithdrew from the Convention, the latter upon the ground mainly that\r\nthere had been \"a withdrawal, in part, of a majority of the States,\"\r\nwhile Butler, who had voted steadily for Jefferson Davis throughout all\r\nthe balloting at Charleston, gave as an additional ground personal to\r\nhimself, that \"I will not sit in a convention where the African Slave\r\nTrade--which is piracy by the laws of my Country--is approvingly\r\nadvocated\"--referring thereby to a speech, that had been much applauded\r\nby the Convention at Charleston, made by a Georgia delegate (Gaulden),\r\nin which that delegate had said: \"I would ask my friends of the South to\r\ncome up in a proper spirit; ask our Northern friends to give us all our\r\nrights, and take off the ruthless restrictions which cut off the supply\r\nof Slaves from foreign lands.  * * *  I tell you, fellow Democrats, that\r\nthe African Slave Trader is the true Union man (cheers and laughter).  I\r\ntell you that the Slave Trading of Virginia is more immoral, more\r\nunchristian in every possible point of view, than that African Slave\r\nTrade which goes to Africa and brings a heathen and worthless man here,\r\nmakes him a useful man, Christianizes him, and sends him and his\r\nposterity down the stream of Time, to enjoy the blessings of\r\ncivilization.  (Cheers and laughter.) * * *  I come from the first\r\nCongressional District of Georgia.  I represent the African Slave Trade\r\ninterest of that Section.  (Applause.) I am proud of the position I\r\noccupy in that respect.  I believe that the African Slave Trader is a\r\ntrue missionary, and a true Christian.  (Applause.) * * *  Are you\r\nprepared to go back to first principles, and take off your\r\nunconstitutional restrictions, and leave this question to be settled by\r\neach State?  Now, do this, fellow citizens, and you will have Peace in\r\nthe Country.  * * *  I advocate the repeal of the laws prohibiting the\r\nAfrican Slave Trade, because I believe it to be the true Union movement.\r\n* * *  I believe that by re-opening this Trade and giving us Negroes to\r\npopulate the Territories, the equilibrium of the two Sections will be\r\nmaintained.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the withdrawal of the bolting delegates at Baltimore, the\r\nConvention proceeded to ballot for President, and at the end of the\r\nsecond ballot, Mr. Douglas having received \"two-thirds of all votes\r\ngiven in the Convention\" (183) was declared the \"regular nominee of the\r\nDemocratic Party, for the office of President of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAn additional resolution was subsequently adopted as a part of the\r\nplatform, declaring that \"it is in accordance with the true\r\ninterpretation of the Cincinnati platform, that, during the existence of\r\nthe Territorial Governments, the measure of restriction, whatever it may\r\nbe, imposed by the Federal Constitution on the power of the Territorial\r\nLegislatures over the subject of the domestic relations, as the same has\r\nbeen, or shall hereafter be, finally determined by the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States, should be respected by all good citizens, and\r\nenforced with promptness and fidelity by every branch of the General\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of June, pursuant to adjournment, the Democratic Bolters'\r\nConvention met at Richmond, and, after adjourning to meet at Baltimore,\r\nfinally met there on the 28th of that month--twenty-one States being, in\r\nwhole or in part, represented.  This Convention unanimously readopted\r\nthe Southern-wing platform it had previously adopted at Charleston, and,\r\nupon the first ballot, chose, without dissent, John C. Breckinridge of\r\nKentucky, as its candidate for the Presidential office.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, the National Conventions of other Parties had\r\nbeen held, viz.: that of the Republican Party at Chicago, which, with a\r\nsession of three days, May 16-18, had nominated Abraham Lincoln of\r\nIllinois and Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, for President and Vice-President\r\nrespectively; and that of the \"Constitutional Union\" (or Native\r\nAmerican) Party which had severally nominated (May 19) for such\r\npositions, John Bell of Tennessee, and Edward Everett of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe material portion of the Republican National platform, adopted with\r\nentire unanimity by their Convention, was, so far as the Slavery and\r\nDisunion questions were concerned, comprised in these declarations:\r\n\r\nFirst, That the history of the nation, during the last four years, has\r\nfully established the propriety and necessity of the organization and\r\nperpetuation of the Republican Party; and that the causes which called\r\nit into existence are permanent in their nature, and now, more than ever\r\nbefore, demand its peaceful and Constitutional triumph.\r\n\r\nSecond, That the maintenance of the principle, promulgated in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and embodied in the Federal Constitution,\r\n\"that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator\r\nwith certain inalienable rights; that among these are Life, Liberty and\r\nthe pursuit of Happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are\r\ninstituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned,\" is essential to the preservation of our Republican\r\ninstitutions; and that the Federal Constitution, the Rights of the\r\nStates, and the Union of the States must and shall be preserved.\r\n\r\nThird, That to the Union of the States, this Nation owes its\r\nunprecedented increase in population, its surprising development of\r\nmaterial resources, its rapid augmentation of wealth, its happiness at\r\nhome, and its honor abroad; and we hold in abhorrence all schemes for\r\nDisunion, come from whatever source they may: And we congratulate the\r\nCountry that no Republican member of Congress has uttered or\r\ncountenanced the threats of Disunion, so often made by Democratic\r\nmembers, without rebuke, and with applause, from their political\r\nassociates; and we denounce those threats of Disunion, in case of a\r\npopular overthrow of their ascendancy, as denying the vital principles\r\nof a free Government, and as an avowal of contemplated Treason, which it\r\nis the imperative duty of an indignant People, sternly to rebuke and\r\nforever silence.\r\n\r\nFourth, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and\r\nespecially the right of each State, to order and control its own\r\ndomestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is\r\nessential to that balance of powers on which the perfection and\r\nendurance of our political fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless\r\ninvasion, by armed force, of any State or Territory, no matter under\r\nwhat pretext, as among the gravest of crimes.\r\n\r\nFifth, That the present Democratic Administration has far exceeded our\r\nworst apprehensions, in its measureless subserviency to the exactions of\r\na Sectional interest, as especially evinced in its desperate exertions\r\nto force the infamous Lecompton Constitution upon the protesting people\r\nof Kansas; in construing the personal relation between master and\r\nservant to involve an unqualified property in persons; in its attempted\r\nenforcement, everywhere, on land and sea, through the intervention of\r\nCongress and of the Federal Courts, of the extreme pretensions of a\r\npurely local interest; and in its general and unvarying abuse of the\r\npower intrusted to it by a confiding People.\r\n\r\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\nSeventh, That the new dogma that the Constitution, of its own force,\r\ncarries Slavery into any or all of the Territories of the United States,\r\nis a dangerous political heresy, at variance with the explicit\r\nprovisions of that instrument itself, with contemporaneous exposition,\r\nand with legislation and judicial precedent; is revolutionary in its\r\ntendency and subversive of the peace and harmony of the Country.\r\n\r\nEighth, That the normal condition of all the territory of the United\r\nStates is that of Freedom; that as our Republican fathers, when they had\r\nabolished Slavery in all our National Territory, ordained that \"No\r\nperson should be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due\r\nprocess of law,\" it becomes our duty, by legislation, whenever such\r\nlegislation is necessary, to maintain this provision of the Constitution\r\nagainst all attempts to violate it; and we deny the authority of\r\nCongress, of a Territorial Legislature, or of any individuals, to give\r\nlegal existence to Slavery in any Territory of the United States.\r\n\r\nNinth, That we brand the recent re-opening of the African Slave-trade\r\nunder the cover of our National flag, aided by perversions of judicial\r\npower, as a crime against humanity and a burning shame to our Country\r\nand Age; and we call upon Congress to take prompt and efficient measures\r\nfor the total and final suppression of that execrable traffic.\r\n\r\nTenth, That in the recent vetoes, by their Federal Governors, of the\r\nacts of the Legislatures of Kansas and Nebraska, prohibiting Slavery in\r\nthose Territories, we find a practical illustration of the boasted\r\nDemocratic principle of Non-Intervention and Popular Sovereignty\r\nembodied in the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, and a demonstration of the\r\ndeception and fraud involved therein.\r\n\r\nEleventh, That Kansas should, of right, be immediately admitted as a\r\nState, under the Constitution recently formed and adopted by the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\n               *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n\r\nThe National platform of the \"Constitutional Union\" Party, was adopted,\r\nunanimously, in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, experience has demonstrated that platforms adopted by the\r\npartisan Conventions of the Country have had the effect to mislead and\r\ndeceive the People, and at the same time to widen the political\r\ndivisions of the Country, by the creation and encouragement of\r\ngeographical and Sectional parties; therefore,\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That it is both the part of patriotism and of\r\nduty to recognize no political principle other than the Constitution of\r\nthe Country, the Union of the States, and the Enforcement of the Laws,\r\nand that, as representatives of the Constitutional Union men of the\r\nCountry, in National Convention assembled, we hereby pledge ourselves to\r\nmaintain, protect, and defend, separately and unitedly, these great\r\nprinciples of public liberty and national safety, against all enemies,\r\nat home and abroad; believing that thereby peace may once more be\r\nrestored to the Country, the rights of the people and of the States\r\nre-established, and the Government again placed in that condition of\r\njustice, fraternity, and equality which, under the example and\r\nConstitution of our fathers, has solemnly bound every citizen of the\r\nUnited States to maintain a more perfect Union, establish justice,\r\ninsure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote\r\nthe general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves\r\nand our posterity.\"\r\n\r\nThus, by the last of June, 1860, the four National Parties with their\r\nplatforms and candidates were all in the political field prepared for\r\nthe onset.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the attitude of the standard-bearers representing the\r\nplatform-principles of their several Parties, was this:\r\n\r\nLincoln, representing the Republicans, held that Slavery is a wrong, to\r\nbe tolerated in the States where it exists, but which must be excluded\r\nfrom the Territories, which are all normally Free and must be kept Free\r\nby Congressional legislation, if necessary; and that neither Congress,\r\nnor the Territorial Legislature, nor any individual, has power to give\r\nto it legal existence in such Territories.\r\n\r\nBreckinridge, representing the Pro-Slavery wing of the Democracy, held\r\nthat Slavery is a right, which, when transplanted from the Slave-States\r\ninto the Territories, neither Congressional nor Territorial legislation\r\ncan destroy or impair, but which, on the contrary, must, when necessary,\r\nbe protected everywhere by Congress and all other departments of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nDouglas, representing the Anti-Lecompton wing of Democracy, held that\r\nwhether Slavery be right or wrong, the white inhabitants of the\r\nTerritories have the sole right to determine whether it shall or shall\r\nnot exist within their respective limits, subject to the Constitution\r\nand Supreme Court decisions thereon; and that neither Congress nor any\r\nState, nor any outside persons, must interfere with that right.\r\n\r\nBell, representing the remaining political elements, held that it was\r\nall wrong to have any principles at all, except \"the Constitution of the\r\nCountry, the Union of the States, and the Enforcement of the Laws\"--a\r\nplatform which Horace Greeley well described as \"meaning anything in\r\ngeneral, and nothing in particular.\"\r\n\r\nThe canvass that ensued was terribly exciting--Douglas alone, of all the\r\nPresidential candidates, bravely taking the field, both North and South,\r\nin person, in the hope that the magnetism of his personal presence and\r\npowerful intellect might win what, from the start--owing to the adverse\r\nmachinations, in the Northern States, of the Administration or\r\nBreckinridge-Democratic wing--seemed an almost hopeless fight.  In the\r\nSouth, the Democracy was almost a unit in opposition to Douglas,\r\nholding, as they did, that \"Douglas Free-Soilism\" was \"far more\r\ndangerous to the South than the election of Lincoln; because it seeks to\r\ncreate a Free-Soil Party there; while, if Lincoln triumphs, the result\r\ncannot fail to be a South united in her own defense;\" while the old Whig\r\nelement of the South was as unitedly for Bell.  In the North, the\r\nDemocracy were split in twain, three-fourths of them upholding Douglas,\r\nand the balance, powerful beyond their numbers in the possession of\r\nFederal Offices, bitterly hostile to him, and anxious to beat him, even\r\nat the expense of securing the election of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nDouglas's fight was that the candidacy and platform of Bell were\r\nmeaningless, those of both Lincoln and Breckinridge, Sectional, and that\r\nhe alone bore aloft the standard of the entire Union; while, on the\r\nother hand, the supporters of Lincoln, his chief antagonist, claimed\r\nthat--as the burden of the song from the lips of Douglas men, Bell men,\r\nand Breckinridge men alike, was the expression of a \"fear that,\" in the\r\nlanguage of Mr. Seward, \"if the people elected Mr. Lincoln to the\r\nPresidency, they would wake up and find that they had no Country for him\r\nto preside over\"--\"therefore, all three of the parties opposing Mr.\r\nLincoln were in the same boat, and hence the only true Union party, was\r\nthe party which made no threats of Disunion, to wit, the Republican\r\nparty.\"\r\n\r\nThe October elections of 1860 made it plain that Mr. Lincoln would be\r\nelected.  South Carolina began to \"feel good\" over the almost certainty\r\nthat the pretext for Secession for which her leaders had been hoping in\r\nvain for thirty years, was at hand.  On the 25th of October, at Augusta,\r\nSouth Carolina, the Governor, the Congressional delegation, and other\r\nleading South Carolinians, met, and decided that in the event of Mr.\r\nLincoln's election, that State would secede.  Similar meetings, to the\r\nsame end, were also held about the same time, in others of the Southern\r\nStates.  On the 5th of November--the day before the Presidential\r\nelection--the Legislature of South Carolina met at the special call of\r\nGovernor Gist, and, having organized, received a Message from the\r\nGovernor, in which, after stating that he had convened that Body in\r\norder that they might on the morrow \"appoint the number of electors of\r\nPresident and Vice-President to which this State is entitled,\" he\r\nproceeded to suggest \"that the Legislature remain in session, and take\r\nsuch action as will prepare the State for any emergency that may arise.\"\r\nHe went on to \"earnestly recommend that, in the event of Abraham\r\nLincoln's election to the Presidency, a Convention of the people of this\r\nState be immediately called, to consider and determine for themselves\r\nthe mode and measure of redress,\" and, he continued: \"I am constrained\r\nto say that the only alternative left, in my judgment, is the Secession\r\nof South Carolina from the Federal Union.  The indications from many of\r\nthe Southern States justify the conclusion that the Secession of South\r\nCarolina will be immediately followed, if not adopted simultaneously, by\r\nthem, and ultimately by the entire South.  The long-desired cooperation\r\nof the other States having similar institutions, for which so many of\r\nour citizens have been waiting, seems to be near at hand; and, if we are\r\ntrue to ourselves, will soon be realized.  The State has, with great\r\nunanimity declared that she has the right peaceably to Secede, and no\r\npower on earth can rightfully prevent it.\"\r\n\r\n     [Referring to the Ordinance of Nullification adopted by the people\r\n     of South Carolina, November 24, 1832, growing out of the Tariff Act\r\n     of 1832--wherein it was declared that, in the event of the Federal\r\n     Government undertaking to enforce the provisions of that Act: \"The\r\n     people of this State will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from\r\n     all further obligation to maintain or preserve their political\r\n     connection with the people of the other States, and will forthwith\r\n     proceed to organize a separate government, and do all other acts\r\n     and things which Sovereign and independent States may of right\r\n     do.\"]\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to say that \"If, in the exercise of arbitrary power, and\r\nforgetful of the lessons of history, the Government of the United States\r\nshould attempt coercion, it will become our solemn duty to meet force by\r\nforce\"--and promised that the decision of the aforesaid Convention\r\n\"representing the Sovereignty of the State, and amenable to no earthly\r\ntribunal,\" should be, by him, \"carried out to the letter.\"  He\r\nrecommended the thorough reorganization of the Militia; the arming of\r\nevery man in the State between the ages of eighteen and forty-five; and\r\nthe immediate enrollment of ten thousand volunteers officered by\r\nthemselves; and concluded with a confident \"appeal to the Disposer of\r\nall human events,\" in whose keeping the \"Cause\" was to be entrusted.\r\n\r\nThat same evening (November 5), being the eve of the election, at\r\nAugusta, South Carolina, in response to a serenade, United States\r\nSenator Chestnut made a speech of like import, in which, after\r\npredicting the election of Mr. Lincoln, he said: \"Would the South submit\r\nto a Black Republican President, and a Black Republican Congress, which\r\nwill claim the right to construe the Constitution of the Country, and\r\nadminister the Government in their own hands, not by the law of the\r\ninstrument itself, nor by that of the fathers of the Country, nor by the\r\npractices of those who administered seventy years ago, but by rules\r\ndrawn from their own blind consciences and crazy brains?  * * *  The\r\nPeople now must choose whether they would be governed by enemies, or\r\ngovern themselves.\"\r\n\r\nHe declared that the Secession of South Carolina was an \"undoubted\r\nright,\" a \"duty,\" and their \"only safety\" and as to himself, he would\r\n\"unfurl the Palmetto flag, fling it to the breeze, and, with the spirit\r\nof a brave man, live and die as became\" his \"glorious ancestors, and\r\nring the clarion notes of defiance in the ears of an insolent foe!\"\r\n\r\nSo also, in Columbia, South Carolina, Representative Boyce of that\r\nState, and other prominent politicians, harangued an enthusiastic crowd\r\nthat night--Mr. Boyce declaring: \"I think the only policy for us is to\r\narm, as soon as we receive authentic intelligence of the election of\r\nLincoln.  It is for South Carolina, in the quickest manner, and by the\r\nmost direct means, to withdraw from the Union.  Then we will not submit,\r\nwhether the other Southern States will act with us or with our enemies.\r\nThey cannot take sides with our enemies; they must take sides with us.\r\nWhen an ancient philosopher wished to inaugurate a great revolution, his\r\nmotto was to dare! to dare!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                     THE GREAT CONSPIRACY MATURING.\r\n\r\nTHE 6th of November, 1860, came and passed; on the 7th, the prevailing\r\nconviction that Lincoln would be elected had become a certainty, and\r\nbefore the close of that day, the fact had been heralded throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of the Republic.  The excitement of the People was\r\nunparalleled.  The Republicans of the North rejoiced that at last the\r\ngreat wrong of Slavery was to be placed \"where the People could rest in\r\nthe belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction!\"  The\r\nDouglas Democracy, naturally chagrined at the defeat of their great\r\nleader, were filled with gloomy forebodings touching the future of their\r\nCountry; and the Southern Democracy, or at least a large portion of it,\r\nopenly exulted that at last the long-wished-for opportunity for a revolt\r\nof the Slave Power, and a separation of the Slave from the Free States,\r\nwas at hand.  Especially in South Carolina were the \"Fire-eating\"\r\nSouthrons jubilant over the event.\r\n\r\n     [\"South Carolina rejoiced over the election of Lincoln, with\r\n     bonfires and processions.\"  p. 172, Arnold's \"Life of Abraham\r\n     Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\n     \"There was great joy in Charleston, and wherever 'Fire Eaters' most\r\n     did congregate, on the morning of November 7th.  Men rushed to\r\n     shake hands and congratulate each other on the glad tidings of\r\n     Lincoln's election.  * * *  Men thronged the streets, talking,\r\n     laughing, cheering, like mariners long becalmed on a hateful,\r\n     treacherous sea, whom a sudden breeze had swiftly wafted within\r\n     sight of their longed-for haven.\"  p. 332, vol. i., Greeley's\r\n     American Conflict.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile any number of joint resolutions looking to the calling of a\r\nSecession Convention, were introduced in the South Carolina Legislature,\r\nsitting at Columbia, having in view Secession contingent upon the\r\n\"cooperation\" of the other Slave States, or looking to immediate and\r\n\"unconditional\" Secession.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of November 7th, Edmund Ruffin of Virginia--a Secession\r\nfanatic who had come from thence in hot haste--in response to a\r\nserenade, declared to the people of Columbia that: \"The defense of the\r\nSouth, he verily believed, was only to be secured through the lead of\r\nSouth Carolina;\" that, \"old as he was, he had come here to join them in\r\nthat lead;\" and that \"every day delayed, was a day lost to the Cause.\"\r\nHe acknowledged that Virginia was \"not as ready as South Carolina;\" but\r\ndeclared that \"The first drop of blood spilled on the soil of South\r\nCarolina would bring Virginia, and every Southern State, with them.\"  He\r\nthought \"it was perhaps better that Virginia, and all other border\r\nStates, remain quiescent for a time, to serve as a guard against the\r\nNorth.  * * *  By remaining in the Union for a time, she would not only\r\nprevent coercive legislation in Congress, but any attempt for our\r\nsubjugation.\"\r\n\r\nThat same evening came news that, at Charleston, the Grand Jury of the\r\nUnited States District Court had refused to make any presentments,\r\nbecause of the Presidential vote just cast, which, they said, had \"swept\r\naway the last hope for the permanence, for the stability, of the Federal\r\nGovernment of these Sovereign States;\" and that United States District\r\nJudge Magrath had resigned his office, saying to the Grand Jury, as he\r\ndid so: \"In the political history of the United States, an event has\r\nhappened of ominous import to fifteen Slave-holding States.  The State\r\nof which we are citizens has been always understood to have deliberately\r\nfixed its purpose whenever that event should happen.  Feeling an\r\nassurance of what will be the action of the State, I consider it my\r\nduty, without delay, to prepare to obey its wishes.  That preparation is\r\nmade by the resignation of the office I have held.\"\r\n\r\nThe news of the resignations of the Federal Collector and District\r\nAttorney at Charleston, followed, with an intimation that that of the\r\nSub-Treasurer would soon be forthcoming.  On November 9th, a joint\r\nresolution calling an unconditional Secession Convention to meet at\r\nColumbia December 17th, was passed by the Senate, and on the 12th of\r\nNovember went through the House; and both of the United States Senators\r\nfrom South Carolina had now resigned their seats in the United States\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nBesides all these and many other incitements to Secession was the fact\r\nthat at Milledgeville, Georgia, Governor Brown had, November 12th,\r\naddressed a Georgian Military Convention, affirming \"the right of\r\nSecession, and the duty of other Southern States to sustain South\r\nCarolina in the step she was then taking,\" and declaring that he \"would\r\nlike to see Federal troops dare attempt the coercion of a seceding\r\nSouthern State!  For every Georgian who fell in a conflict thus incited,\r\nthe lives of two Federal Soldiers should expiate the outrage on State\r\nSovereignty\"--and that the Convention aforesaid had most decisively\r\ngiven its voice for Secession.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, however, that Alexander H.  Stephens vainly\r\nsought to stem the tide of Secession in his own State, in a speech\r\n(November 14) before the Georgia Legislature, in which he declared that\r\nMr. Lincoln \"can do nothing unless he is backed by power in Congress.\r\nThe House of Representatives is largely in the majority against him.  In\r\nthe Senate he will also be powerless.  There will be a majority of four\r\nagainst him.\"  He also cogently said: \"Many of us have sworn to support\r\nit (the Constitution).  Can we, therefore, for the mere election of a\r\nman to the Presidency--and that too, in accordance with the prescribed\r\nforms of the Constitution--make a point of resistance to the Government,\r\nand, without becoming the breakers of that sacred instrument ourselves,\r\nwithdraw ourselves from it?  Would we not be in the wrong?\"\r\n\r\nBut the occasional words of wisdom that fell from the lips of the few\r\nfar-seeing statesmen of the South, were as chaff before the storm of\r\nDisunion raised by the turbulent Fire-eaters, and were blown far from\r\nthe South, where they might have done some good for the Union cause,\r\naway up to the North, where they contributed to aid the success of the\r\ncontemplated Treason and Rebellion, by lulling many of the people there,\r\ninto a false sense of security.  Unfortunately, also, even the ablest of\r\nthe Southern Union men were so tainted with the heretical doctrine of\r\nStates-Rights, which taught the \"paramount allegiance\" of the citizen to\r\nthe State, that their otherwise powerful appeals for the preservation of\r\nthe Union were almost invariably handicapped by the added protestation\r\nthat in any event--and however they might deplore the necessity--they\r\nwould, if need be, go with their State, against their own convictions of\r\nduty to the National Union.\r\n\r\nHence in this same speech we find that Mr. Stephens destroyed the whole\r\neffect of his weighty and logical appeal against Secession from the\r\nUnion, by adding to it, that, \"Should Georgia determine to go out of the\r\nUnion I shall bow to the will of her people.  Their cause is my cause,\r\nand their destiny is my destiny; and I trust this will be the ultimate\r\ncourse of all.\"--and by further advising the calling of a Convention of\r\nthe people to decide the matter; thus, in advance, as it were, binding\r\nhimself hand and foot, despite his previous Union utterances, to do the\r\nfell bidding of the most rampant Disunionists.  And thus, in due time,\r\nit befell, as we shall see, that this \"saving clause\" in his \"Union\r\nspeech,\" brought him at the end, not to that posture of patriotic\r\nheroism to which he aspired when he adjured his Georgian auditors to\r\n\"let us be found to the last moment standing on the deck (of the\r\nRepublic), with the Constitution of the United States waving over our\r\nheads,\" but to that of an imprisoned traitor and defeated rebel against\r\nthe very Republic and Constitution which he had sworn to uphold and\r\ndefend!\r\n\r\nThe action of the South Carolina Legislature in calling an Unconditional\r\nSecession Convention, acted among the Southern States like a spark in a\r\ntrain of gunpowder.  Long accustomed to incendiary resolutions of\r\nPro-Slavery political platforms, as embodying the creed of Southern men;\r\ncommitted by those declarations to the most extreme action when, in\r\ntheir judgment, the necessity should arise; and worked up during the\r\nPresidential campaign by swarming Federal officials inspired by the\r\nfanatical Secession leaders; the entire South only needed the spark from\r\nthe treasonable torch of South Carolina, to find itself ablaze, almost\r\nfrom one end to the other, with the flames of revolt.\r\n\r\nGovernor after Governor, in State after State, issued proclamation after\r\nproclamation, calling together their respective Legislatures, to\r\nconsider the situation and whether their respective States should join\r\nSouth Carolina in seceding from the Union.  Kentucky alone, of them all,\r\nseemed for a time to keep cool, and look calmly and reasonably through\r\nthe Southern ferment to the horrors beyond.  In an address issued by\r\nGovernor Magoffin of that State, to the people, he said:\r\n\r\n\"To South Carolina and such other States as may wish to secede from the\r\nUnion, I would say: The geography of this Country will not admit of a\r\ndivision; the mouth and sources of the Mississippi River cannot be\r\nseparated without the horrors of Civil War.  We cannot sustain you in\r\nthis movement merely on account of the election of Mr. Lincoln.  Do not\r\nprecipitate by premature action into a revolution or Civil War, the\r\nconsequences of which will be most frightful to all of us.  It may yet\r\nbe avoided.  There is still hope, faint though it be.  Kentucky is a\r\nBorder State, and has suffered more than all of you.  * * *  She has a\r\nright to claim that her voice, and the voice of reason, and moderation\r\nand patriotism shall be heard and heeded by you.  If you secede, your\r\nrepresentatives will go out of Congress and leave us at the mercy of a\r\nBlack Republican Government.  Mr. Lincoln will have no check.  He can\r\nappoint his Cabinet, and have it confirmed.  The Congress will then be\r\nRepublican, and he will be able to pass such laws as he may suggest.\r\nThe Supreme Court will be powerless to protect us.  We implore you to\r\nstand by us, and by our friends in the Free States; and let us all, the\r\nbold, the true, and just men in the Free and Slave States, with a united\r\nfront, stand by each other, by our principles, by our rights, our\r\nequality, our honor, and by the Union under the Constitution.  I believe\r\nthis is the only way to save it; and we can do it.\"\r\n\r\nBut this \"still small voice\" of conscience and of reason, heard like a\r\nwhisper from the mouths of Stephens in Georgia, and Magoffin in\r\nKentucky, was drowned in the clamor and tumult of impassioned harangues\r\nand addresses, and the drumming and tramp of the \"minute men\" of South\r\nCarolina, and other military organizations, as they excitedly prepared\r\nthroughout the South for the dread conflict at arms which they\r\nrecklessly invited, and savagely welcomed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how President Andrew Jackson some thirty years before, had\r\nstamped out Nullification and Disunion in South Carolina, with an iron\r\nheel.\r\n\r\nBut a weak and feeble old man--still suffering from the effects of the\r\nmysterious National Hotel poisoning--was now in the Executive Chair at\r\nthe White House.  Well-meaning, doubtless, and a Union man at heart, his\r\nenfeebled intellect was unable to see, and hold firm to, the only true\r\ncourse.  He lacked clearness of perception, decision of character, and\r\nnerve.  He knew Secession was wrong, but allowed himself to be persuaded\r\nthat he had no Constitutional power to prevent it.  He had surrounded\r\nhimself in the Cabinet with such unbending adherents and tools of the\r\nSlave-Power, as Howell Cobb of Georgia, his Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nJohn B. Floyd of Virginia, as Secretary of War, Jacob Thompson of\r\nMississippi, as Secretary of the Interior, and Isaac Toucy of\r\nConnecticut, as Secretary of the Navy, before whose malign influence the\r\ncouncils of Lewis Cass of Michigan, the Secretary of State, and other\r\nUnion men, in and out of the Cabinet, were quite powerless.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the Congress met (December 3, 1860) and he transmitted\r\nto it his last Annual Message, it was found that, instead of treating\r\nSecession from the Jacksonian standpoint, President Buchanan feebly\r\nwailed over the threatened destruction of the Union, weakly apologized\r\nfor the contemplated Treason, garrulously scolded the North as being to\r\nblame for it, and, while praying to God to \"preserve the Constitution\r\nand the Union throughout all generations,\" wrung his nerveless hands in\r\ndespair over his own powerlessness--as he construed the Constitution--to\r\nprevent Secession!  Before writing his pitifully imbecile Message,\r\nPresident Buchanan had secured from his Attorney-General (Jeremiah S.\r\nBlack of Pennsylvania) an opinion, in which the latter, after touching\r\nupon certain cases in which he believed the President would be justified\r\nin using force to sustain the Federal Laws, supposed the case of a State\r\nwhere all the Federal Officers had resigned and where there were neither\r\nFederal Courts to issue, nor officers to execute judicial process, and\r\ncontinued: \"In that event, troops would certainly be out of place, and\r\ntheir use wholly illegal.  If they are sent to aid the Courts and\r\nMarshals there must be Courts and Marshals to be aided.  Without the\r\nexercise of these functions, which belong exclusively to the civil\r\nservice, the laws cannot be executed in any event, no matter what may be\r\nthe physical strength which the Government has at its command.  Under\r\nsuch circumstances, to send a military force into any State, with orders\r\nto act against the people, would be simply making War upon them.\"\r\n\r\nResting upon that opinion of Attorney-General Black, President Buchanan,\r\nin his Message, after referring to the solemn oath taken by the\r\nExecutive \"to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" and\r\nstating that there were now no longer any Federal Officers in South\r\nCarolina, through whose agency he could keep that oath, took up the laws\r\nof February 28, 1795, and March 3, 1807, as \"the only Acts of Congress\r\non the Statute-book bearing upon the subject,\" which \"authorize the\r\nPresident, after he shall have ascertained that the Marshal, with his\r\nposse comitatus, is unable to execute civil or criminal process in any\r\nparticular case, to call out the Militia and employ the Army and Navy to\r\naid him in performing this service, having first, by Proclamation,\r\ncommanded the insurgents to 'disperse and retire peaceably to their\r\nrespective abodes, within a limited time'\"--and thereupon held that\r\n\"This duty cannot, by possibility, be performed in a State where no\r\njudicial authority exists to issue process, and where there is no\r\nMarshal to execute it; and where even if there were such an officer, the\r\nentire population would constitute one solid combination to resist him.\"\r\nAnd, not satisfied with attempting to show as clearly as he seemed to\r\nknow how, his own inability under the laws to stamp out Treason, he\r\nproceeded to consider what he thought Congress also could not do under\r\nthe Constitution.  Said he: \"The question fairly stated, is: Has the\r\nConstitution delegated to Congress the power to coerce into submission a\r\nState which is attempting to withdraw, or has actually withdrawn, from\r\nthe Confederacy?  If answered in the affirmative, it must be on the\r\nprinciple that the power has been conferred upon Congress to declare and\r\nmake War against a State.  After much serious reflection, I have arrived\r\nat the conclusion that no such power has been delegated to Congress or\r\nto any other department of the Federal Government.\"  And further:\r\n\"Congress possesses many means of preserving it (the Union) by\r\nconciliation; but the sword was not placed in their hands to preserve it\r\nby force.\"\r\n\r\nThus, in President Buchanan's judgment, while, in another part of his\r\nMessage, he had declared that no State had any right, Constitutional or\r\notherwise, to Secede from that Union, which was designed for all time\r\n--yet, if any State concluded thus wrongfully to Secede, there existed no\r\npower in the Union, by the exercise of force, to preserve itself from\r\ninstant dissolution!  How imbecile the reasoning, how impotent the\r\nconclusion, compared with that of President Jackson, thirty years\r\nbefore, in his Proclamation against Nullification and Secession, wherein\r\nthat sturdy patriot declared to the South Carolinians that \"compared\r\nto Disunion, all other evils are light, because that brings with it an\r\naccumulation of all;\" that \"Disunion by armed force, is Treason;\" and\r\nthat he was determined \"to execute the Laws,\" and \"to preserve the\r\nUnion!\"\r\n\r\nPresident Buchanan's extraordinary Message--or so much of it as related\r\nto the perilous condition of the Union--was referred, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, to a Select Committee of Thirty-three, comprising one\r\nmember from each State, in which there was a very large preponderance of\r\nsuch as favored Conciliation without dishonor.  But the debates in both\r\nHouses, in which the most violent language was indulged by the Southern\r\nFire-eaters, as well as other events, soon proved that there was a\r\nsettled purpose on the part of the Slave-Power and its adherents to\r\nresist and spit upon all attempts at placation.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate also (December 5), a Select Committee of Thirteen was\r\nappointed, to consider the impending dangers to the Union, comprising\r\nSenators Powell of Kentucky, Hunter of Virginia, Crittenden of Kentucky,\r\nSeward of New York, Toombs of Georgia, Douglas of Illinois, Collamer of\r\nVermont, Davis of Mississippi, Wade of Ohio, Bigler of Pennsylvania,\r\nRice of Minnesota, Doolittle of Wisconsin, and Grimes of Iowa.  Their\r\nlabors were alike without practical result, owing to the irreconcilable\r\nattitude of the Southrons, who would accept nothing less than a total\r\nrepudiation by the Republicans of the very principles upon which the\r\nrecent Presidential contest had by them been fought and won.  Nor would\r\nthey even accept such a repudiation unless carried by vote of the\r\nmajority of the Republicans.  The dose that they insisted upon the\r\nRepublican Party swallowing must not only be as noxious as possible, but\r\nmust absolutely be mixed by that Party itself, and in addition, that\r\nParty must also go down on its knees, and beg the privilege of so mixing\r\nand swallowing the dose!  That was the impossible attitude into which,\r\nby their bullying and threats, the Slave Power hoped to force the\r\nRepublican Party--either that or \"War.\"\r\n\r\nProject after project in both Houses of Congress looking to Conciliation\r\nwas introduced, referred, reported, discussed, and voted on or not, as\r\nthe case might be, in vain.  And in the meantime, in New York, in\r\nPhiladelphia, and elsewhere in the North, the timidity of Capital showed\r\nitself in great Conciliation meetings, where speeches were applauded and\r\nresolutions adopted of the most abject character, in behalf of \"Peace,\r\nat any price,\" regardless of the sacrifice of honor and principles and\r\neven decency.  In fact the Commercial North, with supplicating hands and\r\nbeseeching face, sank on its knees in a vain attempt to propitiate its\r\nfurious creditor, the South, by asking it not only to pull its nose, but\r\nto spit in its face, both of which it humbly and even anxiously offered\r\nfor the purpose!*\r\n\r\n     [Thus, in Philadelphia, December 13, 1860, at a great meeting held\r\n     at the call of the Mayor, in Independence Square, Mayor Henry led\r\n     off the speaking--which was nearly all in the same line-by saying:\r\n     \"I tell you that if in any portion of our Confederacy, sentiments\r\n     have been entertained and cherished which are inimical to the civil\r\n     rights and social institutions of any other portion, those\r\n     sentiments should be relinquished.\"  Another speaker, Judge George\r\n     W. Woodward, sneeringly asked: \"Whence came these excessive\r\n     sensibilities that cannot bear a few slaves in a remote Territory\r\n     until the white people establish a Constitution?\"  Another, Mr.\r\n     Charles E. Lex (a Republican), speaking of the Southern People,\r\n     said: \"What, then, can we say to them? what more than we have\r\n     expressed in the resolutions we have offered?  If they are really\r\n     aggrieved by any laws upon our Statute-books opposed to their\r\n     rights--if upon examination any such are found to be in conflict\r\n     with the Constitution of these United States--nay, further, if they\r\n     but serve to irritate our brethren of the South, whether\r\n     Constitutional or not, I, for one, have no objection that they\r\n     should instantly be repealed.\"  Another said, \"Let us repeal our\r\n     obnoxious Personal Liberty bills * * *; let us receive our brother\r\n     of the South, if he will come among us for a little time, attended\r\n     by his servant, and permit him thus to come.\"  And the resolutions\r\n     adopted were even still more abject in tone than the speeches.]\r\n\r\nBut the South at present was too busy in perfecting its long-cherished\r\nplans for the disruption of the Union, to more than grimly smile at this\r\nevidence of what it chose to consider \"a divided sentiment\" in the\r\nNorth.  While it weakened the North, it strengthened the South, and\r\ninstead of mollifying the Conspirators against the Union, it inspired\r\nthem with fresh energy in their fell purpose to destroy it.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the Republican press, too, while more dignified, was\r\nthoroughly conciliatory.  The Albany Evening Journal,--[November 30,\r\n1860]--the organ of Governor Seward, recognizing that the South, blinded\r\nby passion, was in dead earnest, but also recognizing the existence of\r\n\"a Union sentiment there, worth cherishing,\" suggested \"a Convention of\r\nthe People, consisting of delegates appointed by the States, in which it\r\nwould not be found unprofitable for the North and South, bringing their\r\nrespective griefs, claims, and proposed reforms, to a common\r\narbitrament, to meet, discuss, and determine upon a future\"--before a\r\nfinal appeal to arms.  So, too, Horace Greeley, in the New York\r\nTribune,--[November 9, 1860.]--after weakly conceding, on his own part,\r\nthe right of peaceable Secession, said: \"But while we thus uphold the\r\npractical liberty, if not the abstract right, of Secession, we must\r\ninsist that the step be taken, if it ever shall be, with the\r\ndeliberation and gravity befitting so momentous an issue.  Let ample\r\ntime be given for reflection; let the subject be fully canvassed before\r\nthe People; and let a popular vote be taken in every case, before\r\nSecession is decreed.\"  Other leading papers of the Northern press, took\r\nsimilar ground for free discussion and conciliatory action.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, as well as the House of Representatives--as also was\r\nshown by the appointment, heretofore mentioned, of Select Committees to\r\nconsider the gravity of the situation, and suggest a remedy--the same\r\nspirit of Conciliation and Concession, and desire for free and frank\r\ndiscussion, was apparent among most of the Northern and Border-State\r\nmembers of those Bodies.  But these were only met by sneers and threats\r\non the part of the Fire-eating Secession members of the South.  In the\r\nSenate, Senator Clingman of North Carolina, sneeringly said: \"They want\r\nto get up a free debate, as the Senator (Mr. Seward) from New York\r\nexpressed it, in one of his speeches.  But a Senator from Texas told me\r\nthe other day that a great many of these free debaters were hanging from\r\nthe trees of that country;\" and Senator Iverson, of Georgia, said:\r\n\"Gentlemen speak of Concession, of the repeal of the Personal Liberty\r\nbills.  Repeal them all to-morrow, and you cannot stop this revolution.\"\r\nAfter declaring his belief that \"Before the 4th of March, five States\r\nwill have declared their independence\" and that \"three other States will\r\nfollow as soon as the action of the people can be had;\" he proceeded to\r\nallude to the refusal of Governor Houston of Texas to call together the\r\nTexas Legislature for action in accord with the Secession sentiment, and\r\ndeclared that \"if he will not yield to that public sentiment, some Texan\r\nBrutus will arise to rid his country of this hoary-headed incubus that\r\nstands between the people and their sovereign will!\"  Then, sneering at\r\nthe presumed cowardice of the North, he continued: \"Men talk about their\r\neighteen millions (of Northern population); but we hear a few days\r\nafterwards of these same men being switched in the face, and they\r\ntremble like sheep-stealing dogs!  There will be no War.  The North,\r\ngoverned by such far-seeing Statesmen as the Senator (Mr. Seward) from\r\nNew York, will see the futility of this.  In less than twelve months, a\r\nSouthern Confederacy will be formed; and it will be the most successful\r\nGovernment on Earth.  The Southern States, thus banded together, will be\r\nable to resist any force in the World.  We do not expect War; but we\r\nwill be prepared for it--and we are not a feeble race of Mexicans\r\neither.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were Republicans in that Body who sturdily met\r\nthe bluster of the Southern Fire-eaters with frank and courageous words\r\nexpressing their full convictions on the situation and their belief that\r\nConcessions could not be made and that Compromises were mere waste\r\npaper.  Thus, Senator Ben Wade of Ohio, among the bravest and manliest\r\nof them all, in a speech in the Senate, December 17, the very day on\r\nwhich the South Carolina Secession Convention was to assemble, said to\r\nthe Fire-eaters: \"I tell you frankly that we did lay down the principle\r\nin our platform, that we would prohibit, if we had the power, Slavery\r\nfrom invading another inch of the Free Soil of this Government.  I stand\r\nto that principle to-day.  I have argued it to half a million of people,\r\nand they stand by it; they have commissioned me to stand by it; and, so\r\nhelp me God, I will! * * *  On the other hand, our platform repudiates\r\nthe idea that we have any right, or harbor any ultimate intention to\r\ninvade or interfere with your institutions in your own States.  * * *\r\nIt is not, by your own confessions, that Mr. Lincoln is expected to\r\ncommit any overt act by which you may be injured.  You will not even\r\nwait for any, you say; but, by anticipating that the Government may do\r\nyou an injury, you will put an end to it--which means, simply and\r\nsquarely, that you intend to rule or ruin this Government.  * * *  As to\r\nCompromises, I supposed that we had agreed that the Day of Compromises\r\nwas at an end.  The most solemn we have made have been violated, and are\r\nno more.  * * *  We beat you on the plainest and most palpable issue\r\never presented to the American people, and one which every man\r\nunderstood; and now, when we come to the Capital, we tell you that our\r\ncandidates must and shall be inaugurated--must and shall administer this\r\nGovernment precisely as the Constitution prescribes.  * * *  I tell you\r\nthat, with that verdict of the people in my pocket, and standing on the\r\nplatform on which these candidates were elected, I would suffer anything\r\nbefore I would Compromise in any way.\"\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, on December 10, 1860, a number of\r\npropositions looking to a peaceful settlement of the threatened danger,\r\nwere offered and referred to the Select Committee of Thirty-three.  On\r\nthe following Monday, December 17, by 154 yeas to 14 nays, the House\r\nadopted a resolution, offered by Mr. Adrian of New Jersey, in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we deprecate the spirit of disobedience to the\r\nConstitution, wherever manifested; and that we earnestly recommend the\r\nrepeal of all Statutes by the State Legislatures in conflict with, and\r\nin violation of, that sacred instrument, and the laws of Congress passed\r\nin pursuance thereof.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day, the House adopted, by 135 yeas to no nays, a resolution\r\noffered by Mr. Lovejoy of Illinois, in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, The Constitution of the United States is the Supreme law of\r\nthe Land, and ready and faithful obedience to it a duty of all good and\r\nlaw-abiding citizens; Therefore:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we deprecate the spirit of disobedience to the\r\nConstitution, wherever manifested; and that we earnestly recommend the\r\nrepeal of all Nullification laws; and that it is the duty of the\r\nPresident of the United States to protect and defend the property of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\n     [This resolution, before adoption, was modified by declaring it to\r\n     be the duty of all citizens, whether \"good and law abiding\" or not,\r\n     to yield obedience to the Constitution, as will be seen by\r\n     referring to the proceedings in the Globe of that date, where the\r\n     following appears:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. LOGAN.  I hope there will be no objection on this side of the\r\n     House to the introduction of the [Lovejoy] resolution.  I can see\r\n     no difference myself, between this resolution and the one\r\n     [Adrian's] just passed, except in regard to verbiage.  I can find\r\n     but one objection to the resolution, and that is in the use of the\r\n     words declaring that all' law abiding' citizens should obey the\r\n     Constitution.  I think that all men should do so.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. LOVEJOY.  I accept the amendment suggested by my Colleague.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. LOGAN.  It certainly should include members of Congress; but\r\n     if it is allowed to remain all 'good and law abiding' citizens, I\r\n     do not think it will include them.  [Laughter.]\r\n\r\n     \"The resolution was modified by the omission of those words.\"]\r\n\r\nIt also adopted, by 115 yeas to 44 nays, a resolution offered by Mr.\r\nMorris of Illinois, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved by the House of Representatives: That we properly estimate the\r\nimmense value of our National Union to our collective and individual\r\nhappiness; that we cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment\r\nto it; that we will speak of it as the palladium of our political safety\r\nand prosperity; that we will watch its preservation with jealous\r\nanxiety; that we will discountenance whatever may suggest even a\r\nsuspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned, and indignantly frown\r\nupon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our\r\nCountry from the rest, or enfeeble the sacred ties which now link\r\ntogether the various parts; that we regard it as a main pillar in the\r\nedifice of our real independence, the support of tranquillity at home,\r\nour peace abroad, our safety, our prosperity, and that very liberty\r\nwhich we so highly prize; that we have seen nothing in the past, nor do\r\nwe see anything in the present, either in the election of Abraham\r\nLincoln to the Presidency of the United States, or from any other\r\nexisting cause, to justify its dissolution; that we regard its\r\nperpetuity as of more value than the temporary triumph of any Party or\r\nany man; that whatever evils or abuses exist under it ought to be\r\ncorrected within the Union, in a peaceful and Constitutional way; that\r\nwe believe it has sufficient power to redress every wrong and enforce\r\nevery right growing out of its organization, or pertaining to its proper\r\nfunctions; and that it is a patriotic duty to stand by it as our hope in\r\nPeace and our defense in War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                           SECESSION ARMING.\r\n\r\nWhile Congress was encouraging devotion to the Union, and its Committees\r\nstriving for some mode by which the impending perils might be averted\r\nwithout a wholesale surrender of all just principles, the South Carolina\r\nConvention met (December 17, 1860) at Columbia, and after listening to\r\ninflammatory addresses by commissioners from the States of Alabama and\r\nMississippi, urging immediate and unconditional Secession, unanimously\r\nand with \"tremendous cheering\" adopted a resolution: \"That it is the\r\nopinion of the Convention that the State of South Carolina should\r\nforthwith Secede from the Federal Union, known as the United States of\r\nAmerica,\"--and then adjourned to meet at Charleston, South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe next day, and following days, it met there, at \"Secession Hall,\"\r\nlistening to stimulating addresses, while a committee of seven worked\r\nupon the Ordinance of Secession.  Among the statements made by orators,\r\nwere several clear admissions that the rebellious Conspiracy had existed\r\nfor very many years, and that Mr. Lincoln's election was simply the\r\nlong-sought-for pretext for Rebellion.  Mr. Parker said: \"It is no\r\nspasmodic effort that has come suddenly upon us; it has been gradually\r\nculminating for a long period of thirty years.  At last it has come to\r\nthat point where we may say, the matter is entirely right.\"  Mr. Inglis\r\nsaid: \"Most of us have had this matter under consideration for the last\r\ntwenty years; and I presume that we have by this time arrived at a\r\ndecision upon the subject.\"  Mr. Keitt said: \"I have been engaged in\r\nthis movement ever since I entered political life; * * *  we have\r\ncarried the body of this Union to its last resting place, and now we\r\nwill drop the flag over its grave.\"  Mr. Barnwell Rhett said: \"The\r\nSecession of South Carolina is not an event of a day.  It is not\r\nanything produced by Mr. Lincoln's election, or by the non-execution of\r\nthe Fugitive Slave Law.  It has been a matter which has been gathering\r\nhead for thirty years.\"  Mr. Gregg said: \"If we undertake to set forth\r\nall the causes, do we not dishonor the memory of all the statesmen of\r\nSouth Carolina, now departed, who commenced forty years ago a war\r\nagainst the tariff and against internal improvement, saying nothing of\r\nthe United States Bank, and other measures which may now be regarded as\r\nobsolete.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of December, 1860--the fourth day of the sittings--the\r\nOrdinance of Secession was reported by the Committee, and was at once\r\nunanimously passed, as also was a resolution that \"the passage of the\r\nOrdinance be proclaimed by the firing of artillery and ringing of the\r\nbells of the city, and such other demonstrations as the people may deem\r\nappropriate on the passage of the great Act of Deliverance and Liberty;\"\r\nafter which the Convention jubilantly adjourned to meet, and ratify,\r\nthat evening.  At the evening session of this memorable Convention, the\r\nGovernor and Legislature attending, the famous Ordinance was read as\r\nengrossed, signed by all the delegates, and, after announcement by the\r\nPresident that \"the State of South Carolina is now and henceforth a Free\r\nand Independent Commonwealth;\" amid tremendous cheering, the Convention\r\nadjourned.  This, the first Ordinance of Secession passed by any of the\r\nRevolting States, was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"An Ordinance to dissolve the Union between the State of South Carolina\r\nand other States united with her, under the compact entitled the\r\n'Constitution of the United States of America.'\r\n\r\n\"We the people of the State of South Carolina in Convention assembled,\r\ndo declare and ordain, and it is hereby declared and ordained, that the\r\nOrdinance adopted by us in Convention on the 23rd day of May, in the\r\nyear of our Lord 1788, whereby the Constitution of the United States of\r\nAmerica was ratified, and also all Acts and parts of Acts of the General\r\nAssembly of this State ratifying the amendments of the said\r\nConstitution, are hereby repealed; and that the Union now subsisting\r\nbetween South Carolina and other States, under the name of the United\r\nStates of America, is hereby dissolved.\"\r\n\r\nThus, and in these words, was joyously adopted and ratified, that solemn\r\nAct of Separation which was doomed to draw in its fateful train so many\r\nother Southern States, in the end only to be blotted out with the blood\r\nof hundreds of thousands of their own brave sons, and their equally\r\ncourageous Northern brothers.\r\n\r\nState after State followed South Carolina in the mad course of Secession\r\nfrom the Union.  Mississippi passed a Secession Ordinance, January 9,\r\n1861.  Florida followed, January 10th; Alabama, January 11th; Georgia,\r\nJanuary 18th; Louisiana, January 26th; and Texas, February 1st;\r\nArkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia held back until a later period;\r\nwhile Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, and Delaware, abstained\r\naltogether from taking the fatal step, despite all attempts to bring\r\nthem to it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, South Carolina had put on all the dignity of\r\na Sovereign and Independent State.  Her Governor had a \"cabinet\"\r\ncomprising Secretaries of State, War, Treasury, the Interior, and a\r\nPostmaster General. She had appointed Commissioners, to proceed to the\r\nother Slave-holding States, through whom a Southern Congress was\r\nproposed, to meet at Montgomery, Alabama; and had appointed seven\r\ndelegates to meet the delegates from such other States in that proposed\r\nSouthern Congress.  On the 21st of December, 1860, three Commissioners\r\n(Messrs.  Barnwell, Adams, and Orr) were also appointed to proceed to\r\nWashington, and treat for the cession by the United States to South\r\nCarolina, of all Federal property within the limits of the latter.  On\r\nthe 24th, Governor Pickens issued a Proclamation announcing the adoption\r\nof the Ordinance of Secession, declaring \"that the State of South\r\nCarolina is, as she has a right to be, a separate sovereign, free and\r\nindependent State, and as such, has a right to levy war, conclude peace,\r\nnegotiate treaties, leagues or covenants, and to do all acts whatsoever\r\nthat rightfully appertain to a free and independent State;\" the which\r\nproclamation was announced as \"Done in the eighty-fifth year of the\r\nSovereignty and Independence of South Carolina.\"  On the same day (the\r\nSenators from that State in the United States Senate having long since,\r\nas we have seen, withdrawn from that body) the Representatives of South\r\nCarolina in the United States House of Representatives withdrew.\r\n\r\nSerious dissensions in the Cabinet of President Buchanan, were now\r\nrapidly disintegrating the \"official family\" of the President.  Lewis\r\nCass, the Secretary of State, disgusted with the President's cowardice\r\nand weakness, and declining to be held responsible for Mr. Buchanan's\r\npromise not to reinforce the garrisons of the National Forts, under\r\nMajor Anderson, in Charleston harbor, retired from the Cabinet December\r\n12th--Howell Cobb having already, \"because his duty to Georgia required\r\nit,\" resigned the Secretaryship of the Treasury, and left it bankrupt\r\nand the credit of the Nation almost utterly destroyed.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of December, Major Anderson evacuated Fort Moultrie,\r\nremoving all his troops and munitions of war to Fort Sumter--whereupon a\r\ncry went up from Charleston that this was in violation of the\r\nPresident's promise to take no step looking to hostilities, provided the\r\nSecessionists committed no overt act of Rebellion, up to the close of\r\nhis fast expiring Administration.  On the 29th, John B. Floyd, Secretary\r\nof War, having failed to secure the consent of the Administration to an\r\nentire withdrawal of the Federal garrison from the harbor of Charleston,\r\nalso resigned, and the next day--he having in the meantime escaped in\r\nsafety to Virginia--was indicted by the Grand Jury at Washington, for\r\nmalfeasance and conspiracy to defraud the Government in the theft of\r\n$870,000 of Indian Trust Bonds from the Interior Department, and the\r\nsubstitution therefor of Floyd's acceptances of worthless\r\narmy-transportation drafts on the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\nJacob Thompson, Secretary of the Interior, also resigned, January 8th,\r\n1861, on the pretext that \"additional troops, he had heard, have been\r\nordered to Charleston\" in the \"Star of the West.\"--[McPherson's History\r\nof the Rebellion, p. 28.]\r\n\r\nSeveral changes were thus necessitated in Mr. Buchanan's cabinet, by\r\nthese and other resignations, so that by the 18th of January, 1861,\r\nJeremiah S. Black was Secretary of State; General John A. Dix, Secretary\r\nof the Treasury; Joseph Holt, Secretary of War; Edwin M. Stanton,\r\nAttorney General; and Horatio King, Postmaster General.  But before\r\nleaving the Cabinet, the conspiring Southern members of it, and their\r\nfriends, had managed to hamstring the National Government, by scattering\r\nthe Navy in other quarters of the World; by sending the few troops of\r\nthe United States to remote points; by robbing the arsenals in the\r\nNorthern States of arms and munitions of war, so as to abundantly supply\r\nthe Southern States at the critical moment; by bankrupting the Treasury\r\nand shattering the public credit of the Nation; and by other means no\r\nless nefarious.  Thus swindled, betrayed, and ruined, by its degenerate\r\nand perfidious sons, the imbecile Administration stood with dejected\r\nmien and folded hands helplessly awaiting the coming catastrophe.\r\n\r\nOn December 28th, 1860, the three Commissioners of South Carolina having\r\nreached Washington, addressed to the President a communication, in\r\nwhich--after reciting their powers and duties, under the Ordinance of\r\nSecession, and stating that they had hoped to have been ready to proceed\r\nto negotiate amicably and without \"hostile collision,\" but that \"the\r\nevents--[The removal, to Fort Sumter, of Major Anderson's command, and\r\nwhat followed.]--of the last twenty-four hours render such an assurance\r\nimpossible\"--they declared that the troops must be withdrawn from\r\nCharleston harbor, as \"they are a standing menace which render\r\nnegotiation impossible,\" threatening speedily to bring the questions\r\ninvolved, to \"a bloody issue.\"\r\n\r\nTo this communication Mr. Buchanan replied at considerable length,\r\nDecember 30th, in an apologetic, self-defensive strain, declaring that\r\nthe removal by Major Anderson of the Federal troops under his command,\r\nfrom Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter was done \"upon his own responsibility,\r\nand without authority,\" and that he (the President) \"had intended to\r\ncommand him to return to his former position,\" but that events had so\r\nrapidly transpired as to preclude the giving of any such command;\r\n\r\n     [The seizure by the Secessionists, under the Palmetto Flag, of\r\n     Castle Pinckney and Fort Moultrie; the simultaneous raising of that\r\n     flag over the Federal Custom House and Post Office at Charleston;\r\n     the resignation of the Federal Collector, Naval Officer and\r\n     Surveyor of that Port--all of which occurred December 27th; and the\r\n     seizure \"by force of arms,\" December 30th, of the United States\r\n     Arsenal at that point.]\r\n\r\nand concluding, with a very slight stiffening of backbone, by saying:\r\n\"After this information, I have only to add that, whilst it is my duty\r\nto defend Fort Sumter as a portion of the public property of the United\r\nStates against hostile attacks, from whatever quarter they may come, by\r\nsuch means as I may possess for this purpose, I do not perceive how such\r\na defense can be construed into a menace against the city of\r\nCharleston.\"  To this reply of the President, the Commissioners made\r\nrejoinder on the 1st of January, 1861; but the President \"declined to\r\nreceive\" the communication.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, until the end of President Buchanan's term of office,\r\nand the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln as President, March 4th, 1861,\r\nevents crowded each other so hurriedly, that the flames of Rebellion in\r\nthe South were continually fanned, while the public mind in the North\r\nwas staggered and bewildered, by them.\r\n\r\nOn January 2nd, prior to the Secession of Georgia, Forts Pulaski and\r\nJackson, commanding Savannah, and the Federal Arsenal at Augusta,\r\nGeorgia, with two 12 pound howitzers, two cannon, 22,000 muskets and\r\nrifles, and ammunition in quantity, were seized by Rebel militia.  About\r\nthe same date, although North Carolina had not seceded, her Governor\r\n(Ellis) seized the Federal Arsenal at Fayetteville, Fort Macon, and\r\nother fortifications in that State, \"to preserve them\" from mob-seizure.\r\n\r\nJanuary 4th, anticipating Secession, Alabama State troops seized Fort\r\nMorgan, with 5,000 shot and shell, and Mount Vernon Arsenal at Mobile,\r\nwith 2,000 stand of arms, 150, 000 pounds of powder, some pieces of\r\ncannon, and a large quantity of other munitions of war.  The United\r\nStates Revenue cutter, \"Lewis Cass,\" was also surrendered to Alabama.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th, the Federal steamer \"Star of the West,\" with reinforcements\r\nand supplies for Fort Sumter, left New York in the night--and Secretary\r\nJacob Thompson notified the South Carolina Rebels of the fact.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th, the \"Star of the West\" appeared off Charleston bar, and\r\nwhile steaming toward Fort Sumter, was fired upon by Rebel batteries at\r\nFort Moultrie and Morris Island, and struck by a shot, whereupon she\r\nreturned to New York without accomplishing her mission.  That day the\r\nState of Mississippi seceded from the Union.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th, the Federal storeship \"Texas,\" with Federal guns and\r\nstores, was seized by Texans.  On the same day Florida seceded.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th, Forts Jackson and St. Philip, commanding the mouth of the\r\nMississippi River, and Fort Pike, dominating Lake Pontchartrain, were\r\nseized by Louisiana troops; also the Federal Arsenal at Baton Rouge,\r\nwith 50,000 small arms, 4 howitzers, 20 heavy pieces of ordnance, 2\r\nbatteries, 300 barrels of powder, and other stores.  The State of\r\nAlabama also seceded the same day.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th--Fort Marion, the coast surveying schooner \"Dana,\" the\r\nArsenal at St. Augustine, and that on the Chattahoochee, with 500,000\r\nmusket cartridges, 300,000 rifle cartridges and 50,000 pounds of powder,\r\nhaving previously been seized--Forts Barrancas and McRae, and the Navy\r\nYard at Pensacola, were taken by Rebel troops of Florida, Alabama and\r\nMississippi.  On the same day, Colonel Hayne, of South Carolina, arrived\r\nat Washington as Agent or Commissioner to the National Government from\r\nGovernor Pickens of that State.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, the South Carolina Legislature resolved \"that any attempt\r\nby the Federal Government to reinforce Fort Sumter will be regarded as\r\nan act of open hostility, and a Declaration of War.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 16th, Colonel Hayne, of South Carolina, developed his mission,\r\nwhich was to demand of the President the surrender of Fort Sumter to the\r\nSouth Carolina authorities--a demand that had already been made upon,\r\nand refused by, Major Anderson.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence concerning this demand, between Colonel Hayne and ten\r\nSouthern United States Senators;--[Senators Wigfall, Hemphill, Yulee,\r\nMallory, Jeff.  Davis, C. C. Clay, Fitzgerald, Iverson, Slidell, and\r\nBenjamin.]--the reply of the President, by Secretary Holt, to those\r\nSenators; Governor Pickens's review of the same; and the final demand;\r\nconsumed the balance of the month of January; and ended, February 6th,\r\nin a further reply, through the Secretary of War, from the President,\r\nasserting the title of the United States to that Fort, and declining the\r\ndemand, as \"he has no Constitutional power to cede or surrender it.\"\r\nSecretary Holt's letter concluded by saying: \"If, with all the\r\nmultiplied proofs which exist of the President's anxiety for Peace, and\r\nof the earnestness with which he has pursued it, the authorities of that\r\nState shall assault Fort Sumter, and peril the lives of the handful of\r\nbrave and loyal men shut up within its walls, and thus plunge our Common\r\nCountry into the horrors of Civil War, then upon them and those they\r\nrepresent, must rest the responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nBut to return from this momentary diversion: On the 18th of January,\r\nGeorgia seceded; and on the 20th, the Federal Fort at Ship Island,\r\nMississippi, and the United States Hospital on the Mississippi River\r\nwere seized by Mississippi troops.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th, Louisiana seceded.  On the 28th, Louisiana troops seized\r\nall the quartermaster's and commissary stores held by Federal officials;\r\nand the United States Revenue cutter \"McClelland\" surrendered to the\r\nRebels.\r\n\r\nOn February 1st, the Louisiana Rebels seized the National Mint and\r\nCustom House at New Orleans, with $599,303 in gold and silver.  On the\r\nsame day the State of Texas seceded.\r\n\r\nOn February 8th, the National Arsenal at Little Rock, Arkansas, with\r\n9,000 small arms, 40 cannon, and quantities of ammunition, was seized;\r\nand the same day the Governor of Georgia ordered the National Collector\r\nof the Port of Savannah to retain all collections and make no further\r\npayments to the United States Government.*\r\n\r\n\r\n     [It was during this eventful month that, certain United States\r\n     troops having assembled at the National Capital, and the House of\r\n     Representatives having asked the reason therefor, reply was made by\r\n     the Secretary of War as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"WAR DEPARTMENT, February 18, 1861.\r\n          [Congressional Globe, August 8, 1861, pp.  457,458]\r\n     \"SIR: On the 11th February, the House of Representatives adopted a\r\n     resolution requesting the President, if not incompatible with the\r\n     public interests, to communicate 'the reasons that had induced him\r\n     to assemble so large a number of troops in this city, and why they\r\n     are kept here; and whether he has any information of a Conspiracy\r\n     upon the part of any portion of the citizens of this Country to\r\n     seize upon the Capital and prevent the Inauguration of the\r\n     President elect.'\r\n\r\n     \"This resolution having been submitted to this Department for\r\n     consideration and report, I have the honor to state, that the body\r\n     of troops temporarily transferred to this city is not as large as\r\n     is assumed by the resolution, though it is a well-appointed corps\r\n     and admirably adapted for the preservation of the public peace.\r\n     The reasons which led to their being assembled here will now be\r\n     briefly stated.\r\n\r\n     \"I shall make no comment upon the origin of the Revolution which,\r\n     for the last three months, has been in progress in several of the\r\n     Southern States, nor shall I enumerate the causes which have\r\n     hastened its advancement or exasperated its temper.  The scope of\r\n     the questions submitted by the House will be sufficiently met by\r\n     dealing with the facts as they exist, irrespective of the cause\r\n     from which they have proceeded.  That Revolution has been\r\n     distinguished by a boldness and completeness of success rarely\r\n     equaled in the history of Civil Commotions.  Its overthrow of the\r\n     Federal authority has not only been sudden and wide-spread, but has\r\n     been marked by excesses which have alarmed all and been sources of\r\n     profound humiliation to a large portion of the American People.\r\n     Its history is a history of surprises and treacheries and ruthless\r\n     spoliations.  The Forts of the United States have been captured and\r\n     garrisoned, and hostile flags unfurled upon their ramparts.  Its\r\n     arsenals have been seized, and the vast amount of public arms they\r\n     contained appropriated to the use of the captors; while more than\r\n     half a million dollars, found in the Mint at New Orleans, has been\r\n     unscrupulously applied to replenish the coffers of Louisiana.\r\n     Officers in command of revenue cutters of the United States have\r\n     been prevailed on to violate their trusts and surrender the\r\n     property in their charge; and instead of being branded for their\r\n     crimes, they, and the vessels they betrayed, have been cordially\r\n     received into the service of the Seceded States.  These movements\r\n     were attended by yet more discouraging indications of immorality.\r\n     It was generally believed that this Revolution was guided and urged\r\n     on by men occupying the highest positions in the public service,\r\n     and who, with the responsibilities of an oath to support the\r\n     Constitution still resting upon their consciences, did not hesitate\r\n     secretly to plan and openly to labor for, the dismemberment of the\r\n     Republic whose honors they enjoyed and upon whose Treasury they\r\n     were living.  As examples of evil are always more potent than those\r\n     of good, this spectacle of demoralization on the part of States and\r\n     statesmen could not fail to produce the most deplorable\r\n     consequences.  The discontented and the disloyal everywhere took\r\n     courage.  In other States, adjacent to and supposed to sympathize\r\n     in sense of political wrong with those referred to, Revolutionary\r\n     schemes were set on foot, and Forts and arms of the United States\r\n     seized.  The unchecked prevalence of the Revolution, and the\r\n     intoxication which its triumphs inspired, naturally suggested\r\n     wilder and yet more desperate enterprises than the conquest of\r\n     ungarrisoned Forts, or the plunder of an unguarded Mint.  At what\r\n     time the armed occupation of Washington City became a part of the\r\n     Revolutionary Programme, is not certainly known.  More than six\r\n     weeks ago, the impression had already extensively obtained that a\r\n     Conspiracy for the accomplishment of this guilty purpose was in\r\n     process of formation, if not fully matured.  The earnest endeavors\r\n     made by men known to be devoted to the Revolution, to hurry\r\n     Virginia and Maryland out of the Union, were regarded as\r\n     preparatory steps for the subjugation of Washington.  This plan was\r\n     in entire harmony with the aim and spirit of those seeking the\r\n     subversion of the Government, since no more fatal blow at its\r\n     existence could be struck than the permanent and hostile possession\r\n     of the seat of its power.  It was in harmony, too, with the avowed\r\n     designs of the Revolutionists, which looked to the formation of a\r\n     Confederacy of all the Slave States, and necessarily to the\r\n     Conquest of the Capital within their limits.  It seemed not very\r\n     indistinctly prefigured in a Proclamation made upon the floor of\r\n     the Senate, without qualification, if not exultingly, that the\r\n     Union was already dissolved--a Proclamation which, however\r\n     intended, was certainly calculated to invite, on the part of men of\r\n     desperate fortunes or of Revolutionary States, a raid upon the\r\n     Capital.  In view of the violence and turbulent disorders already\r\n     exhibited in the South, the public mind could not reject such a\r\n     scheme as at all improbable.  That a belief in its existence was\r\n     entertained by multitudes, there can be no doubt, and this belief I\r\n     fully shared.  My conviction rested not only on the facts already\r\n     alluded to, but upon information, some of which was of a most\r\n     conclusive character, that reached the Government from many parts\r\n     of the Country, not merely expressing the prevalence of the opinion\r\n     that such an organization had been formed, but also often\r\n     furnishing the plausible grounds on which the opinion was based.\r\n     Superadded to these proofs, were the oft-repeated declarations of\r\n     men in high political positions here, and who were known to have\r\n     intimate affiliations with the Revolution--if indeed they did not\r\n     hold its reins in their hands--to the effect that Mr. Lincoln would\r\n     not, or should not be inaugurated at Washington.  Such\r\n     declarations, from such men, could not be treated as empty bluster.\r\n     They were the solemn utterances of those who well understood the\r\n     import of their words, and who, in the exultation of the temporary\r\n     victories gained over their Country's flag in the South, felt\r\n     assured that events would soon give them the power to verify their\r\n     predictions.  Simultaneously with these prophetic warnings, a\r\n     Southern journal of large circulation and influence, and which is\r\n     published near the city of Washington, advocated its seizure as a\r\n     possible political necessity.\r\n\r\n     \"The nature and power of the testimony thus accumulated may be best\r\n     estimated by the effect produced upon the popular mind.\r\n     Apprehensions for the safety of the Capital were communicated from\r\n     points near and remote, by men unquestionably reliable and loyal.\r\n     The resident population became disquieted, and the repose of many\r\n     families in the city was known to be disturbed by painful\r\n     anxieties.  Members of Congress, too-men of calm and comprehensive\r\n     views, and of undoubted fidelity to their Country--frankly\r\n     expressed their solicitude to the President and to this Department,\r\n     and formally insisted that the defenses of the Capital should be\r\n     strengthened.  With such warnings, it could not be forgotten that,\r\n     had the late Secretary of War heeded the anonymous letter which he\r\n     received, the tragedy at Harper's Ferry would have been avoided;\r\n     nor could I fail to remember that, had the early admonitions which\r\n     reached here in regard to the designs of lawless men upon the Forts\r\n     of Charleston Harbor been acted on by sending forward adequate\r\n     reinforcements before the Revolution began, the disastrous\r\n     political complications that ensued might not have occurred.\r\n\r\n     \"Impressed by these circumstances and considerations, I earnestly\r\n     besought you to allow the concentration, at this city, of a\r\n     sufficient military force to preserve the public peace from all the\r\n     dangers that seemed to threaten it.  An open manifestation, on the\r\n     part of the Administration, of a determination, as well as of the\r\n     ability, to maintain the laws, would, I was convinced, prove the\r\n     surest, as also the most pacific, means of baffling and dissolving\r\n     any Conspiracy that might have been organized.  It was believed too\r\n     that the highest and most solemn responsibility resting upon a\r\n     President withdrawing from the Government, was to secure to his\r\n     successor a peaceful Inauguration.  So deeply, in my judgment, did\r\n     this duty concern the whole Country and the fair fame of our\r\n     Institutions, that, to guarantee its faithful discharge, I was\r\n     persuaded no preparation could be too determined or too complete.\r\n     The presence of the troops alluded to in the resolution is the\r\n     result of the conclusion arrived at by yourself and Cabinet, on the\r\n     proposition submitted to you by this Department.  Already this\r\n     display of life and loyalty on the part of your Administration, has\r\n     produced the happiest effects.  Public confidence has been\r\n     restored, and the feverish apprehension which it was so mortifying\r\n     to contemplate has been banished.  Whatever may have been the\r\n     machinations of deluded, lawless men, the execution of their\r\n     purpose has been suspended, if not altogether abandoned in view of\r\n     preparations which announce more impressively than words that this\r\n     Administration is alike able and resolved to transfer in peace, to\r\n     the President elect, the authority that, under the Constitution,\r\n     belongs to him.  To those, if such there be, who desire the\r\n     destruction of the Republic, the presence of these troops is\r\n     necessarily offensive; but those who sincerely love our\r\n     Institutions cannot fail to rejoice that, by this timely precaution\r\n     they have possibly escaped the deep dishonor which they must have\r\n     suffered had the Capital, like the Forts and Arsenals of the South,\r\n     fallen into the hands of the Revolutionists, who have found this\r\n     great Government weak only because, in the exhaustless beneficence\r\n     of its spirit, it has refused to strike, even in its own defense,\r\n     lest it should wound the aggressor.\r\n\r\n     \"I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                              \"J. HOLT.\r\n                         \"Secretary of War,\r\n\r\n     \"THE PRESIDENT.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 20th, Forts Chadbourne and Belknap were seized by the Texan\r\nRebels; and on the 22nd, the Federal General Twiggs basely surrendered\r\nto them all the fortifications under his control, his little Army, and\r\nall the Government stores in his possession--comprising $55,000 in\r\nspecie, 35,000 stand of arms, 26 pieces of mounted artillery, 44\r\ndismounted guns, and ammunition, horses, wagons, forage, etc., valued at\r\nnearly $2,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of March, the Texan Rebels seized the United States Revenue\r\ncutter \"Dodge\" at Galveston; and on the 6th, Fort Brown was surrendered\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThus, with surrender after surrender, and seizure after\r\nseizure, of its revenue vessels and fortifications and troops and arms\r\nand munitions of war in the Southern States--with Fort Sumter invested\r\nand at the mercy of any attack, and Fortress Monroe alone of all the\r\nNational strongholds yet safe--with State after State seceding--what\r\nwonder that, while these events gave all encouragement to the Southern\r\nRebels, the Patriots of the North stood aghast at the appalling\r\nspectacle of a crumbling and dissolving Union!\r\n\r\nDuring this period of National peril, the debates in both branches of\r\nCongress upon propositions for adjustment of the unfortunate differences\r\nbetween the Southern Seceders and the Union, as has been already hinted,\r\ncontributed still further to agitate the public mind.  Speech after\r\nspeech by the ablest and most brilliant Americans in public life, for or\r\nagainst such propositions, and discussing the rightfulness or\r\nwrongfulness of Secession, were made in Congress day after day, and, by\r\nmeans of the telegraph and the press, alternately swayed the Northern\r\nheart with feelings of hope, chagrin, elation or despair.\r\n\r\nThe Great Debate was opened in the Senate on almost the very first day\r\nof its session (December 4th, 1860), by Mr. Clingman, of North Carolina,\r\nwho, referring to South Carolina, declared that \"Instead of being\r\nprecipitate, she and the whole South have been wonderfully patient.\"  A\r\nportion of that speech is interesting even at this time, as showing how\r\ncertain phases of the Tariff and Internal Improvement questions entered\r\ninto the consideration of some of the Southern Secession leaders.  Said\r\nhe, \"I know there are intimations that suffering will fall upon us of\r\nthe South, if we secede.  My people are not terrified by any such\r\nconsiderations.  * * *  They have no fears of the future if driven to\r\nrely on themselves.  The Southern States have more territory than all\r\nthe Colonies had when they Seceded from Great Britain, and a better\r\nterritory.  Taking its position, climate, and fertility into\r\nconsideration, there is not upon Earth a body of territory superior to\r\nit.  * * *  The Southern States have, too, at this day, four times the\r\npopulation the Colonies had when they Seceded from Great Britain.  Their\r\nexports to the North and to Foreign Countries were, last year, more than\r\n$300,000,000; and a duty of ten per cent. upon the same amount of\r\nimports would give $30,000,000 of revenue--twice as much as General\r\nJackson's administration spent in its first year.  Everybody can see,\r\ntoo, how the bringing in of $300,000,000 of imports into Southern ports\r\nwould enliven business in our seaboard towns.  I have seen with some\r\nsatisfaction, also, Mr. President, that the war made upon us has\r\nbenefitted certain branches of industry in my State.  There are\r\nmanufacturing establishments in North Carolina, the proprietors of which\r\ntell me that they are making fifty per cent. annually on their whole\r\ncapital, and yet cannot supply one tenth of the demand for their\r\nproduction.  The result of only ten per cent. duties in excluding\r\nproducts from abroad, would give life and impetus to mechanical and\r\nmanufacturing industry, throughout the entire South.  Our people\r\nunderstand these things, and they are not afraid of results, if forced\r\nto declare Independence.  Indeed I do not see why Northern Republicans\r\nshould wish to continue a connection with us upon any terms.  * * *\r\nThey want High Tariff likewise.  They may put on five hundred per cent.\r\nif they choose, upon their own imports, and nobody on our side will\r\ncomplain.  They may spend all the money they raise on railroads, or\r\nopening harbors, or anything on earth they desire, without interference\r\nfrom us; and it does seem to me that if they are sincere in their views\r\nthey ought to welcome a separation.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the very commencement of this long three-months debate, it was the\r\npolicy of the Southern leaders to make it appear that the Southern\r\nStates were in an attitude of injured innocence and defensiveness\r\nagainst Northern aggression.  Hence, it was that, as early as December\r\n5th, on the floor of the Senate, through Mr. Brown, of Mississippi, they\r\ndeclared: \"All we ask is to be allowed to depart in Peace.  Submit we\r\nwill not; and if, because we will not submit to your domination, you\r\nchoose to make War upon us, let God defend the Right!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time it was esteemed necessary to try and frighten the North\r\ninto acquiescence with this demand to be \"let alone.\"  Hence such\r\nutterances as those of Clingman and Iverson, to which reference has\r\nalready been made, and the especially defiant close of the latter's\r\nspeech, when--replying to the temperate but firm Union utterances of Mr.\r\nHale--the Georgia Senator said: \"Sir, I do not believe there will be any\r\nWar; but if War is to come, let it come; we will meet the Senator from\r\nNew Hampshire and all the myrmidons of Abolitionism and Black\r\nRepublicanism everywhere upon our own soil; and, in the language of a\r\ndistinguished member from Ohio in relation to the Mexican War, we will\r\n'welcome you with bloody hands to hospitable graves.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in order to encourage the revolting States to the\r\nspeedy commission of overt acts of Rebellion and violence, that would\r\nprecipitate War without a peradventure, utterances fell from Southern\r\nlips, in the National Senate Chamber, like those of Mr. Wigfall, when he\r\nsaid, during this first day of the debate: \"Frederick the Great, on one\r\noccasion, when he had trumped up an old title to some of the adjacent\r\nterritory, quietly put himself in possession and then offered to treat.\r\nWere I a South Carolinian, as I am a Texan, and I knew that my State was\r\ngoing out of the Union, and that this Government would attempt to use\r\nforce, I would, at the first moment that that fact became manifest,\r\nseize upon the Forts and the arms and the munitions of war, and raise\r\nthe cry 'To your tents, O Israel, and to the God of battles be this\r\nissue!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as we have already seen, the Rebels of the South were not slow in\r\nfollowing the baleful advice to the letter.  But it was not many days\r\nafter this utterance when the Conspirators against the Union evidently\r\nbegan to fear that the ground for Rebellion, upon which they had planted\r\nthemselves, would be taken from under their feet by the impulse of\r\nCompromise and Concession which stirred so strongly the fraternal spirit\r\nof the North.  That peaceful impulse must be checked and exasperated by\r\nsneers and impossible demands.  Hence, on December 12th we find one of\r\nthe most active and favorite mouthpieces of Treason, Mr. Wigfall,\r\nputting forth such demands, in his most offensive manner.\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"If the two Senators from New York (Seward and King), the\r\nSenator from Ohio (Wade), the two Senators from Illinois (Douglas and\r\nTrumbull), the Senator from New Hampshire (Hale), the Senator from\r\nMaine, and others who are regarded as representative men, who have\r\ndenied that by the Constitution of the United States, Slaves are\r\nrecognized as Property; who have urged and advocated those acts which we\r\nregard as aggressive on the part of the People--if they will rise here,\r\nand say in their places, that they desire to propose amendments to the\r\nConstitution, and beg that we will vote for them; that they will, in\r\ngood faith, go to their respective constituencies and urge the\r\nratification; that they believe, if these Gulf States will suspend their\r\naction, that those amendments will be ratified and carried out in good\r\nfaith; that they will cease preaching this 'irrepressible conflict'; and\r\nif, in those amendments, it is declared that Slaves are Property, that\r\nthey shall be delivered up upon demand; and that they will assure us\r\nthat Abolition societies shall be abolished; that Abolition speeches\r\nshall no longer be made; that we shall have peace and quiet; that we\r\nshall not be called cut-throats and pirates and murderers; that our\r\nwomen shall not be slandered--these things being said in good faith, the\r\nSenators begging that we will stay our hand until an honest effort can\r\nbe made, I believe that there is a prospect of giving them a fair\r\nconsideration!\"\r\n\r\nSmall wonder is it, that this labored and ridiculous piece of\r\nimpertinence was received with ironical laughter on the Republican side\r\nof the Senate Chamber.  And it was in reference to these threats, and\r\nthese preposterous demands--including the suppression of the right of\r\nFree Discussion and Liberty of the Press--that, in the same chamber\r\n(January 7, 1861) the gallant and eloquent Baker said:\r\n\r\n\"Your Fathers had fought for that right, and more than that, they had\r\ndeclared that the violation of that right was one of the great causes\r\nwhich impelled them to the Separation.  * * *  Sir, the Liberty of the\r\nPress is the highest safeguard to all Free Government.  Ours could not\r\nexist without it.  It is with us, nay, with all men, like a great\r\nexulting and abounding river, It is fed by the dews of Heaven, which\r\ndistil their sweetest drops to form it.  It gushes from the rill, as it\r\nbreaks from the deep caverns of the Earth.  It is fed by a thousand\r\naffluents, that dash from the mountaintop to separate again into a\r\nthousand bounteous and irrigating rills around.  On its broad bosom it\r\nbears a thousand barks.  There, Genius spreads its purpling sail.\r\nThere, Poetry dips its silver oar.  There, Art, Invention, Discovery,\r\nScience, Morality, Religion, may safely and securely float.  It wanders\r\nthrough every land.  It is a genial, cordial source of thought and\r\ninspiration, wherever it touches, whatever it surrounds.  Sir, upon its\r\nborders, there grows every flower of Grace and every fruit of Truth.  I\r\nam not here to deny that that Stream sometimes becomes a dangerous\r\nTorrent, and destroys towns and cities upon its bank; but I am here to\r\nsay that without it, Civilization, Humanity, Government, all that makes\r\nSociety itself, would disappear, and the World would return to its\r\nancient Barbarism.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if that were to be possible, or so thought for a moment, the fine\r\nconception of the great Poet would be realized.  If that were to be\r\npossible, though but for a moment, Civilization itself would roll the\r\nwheels of its car backward for two thousand years.  Sir, if that were\r\nso, it would be true that:\r\n\r\n          'As one by one in dread Medea's train,\r\n          Star after Star fades off th' ethereal plain,\r\n          Thus at her fell approach and secret might,\r\n          Art after art goes out, and all is night.\r\n          Philosophy, that leaned on Heaven before,\r\n          Sinks to her second cause, and is no more.\r\n          Religion, blushing, veils her sacred fires,\r\n          And, unawares, Morality expires.'\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we will not risk these consequences, even for Slavery; we will not\r\nrisk these consequences even for Union; we will not risk these\r\nconsequences to avoid that Civil War with which you threaten us; that\r\nWar which, you announce so deadly, and which you declare to be\r\ninevitable.  * * *  I will never yield to the idea that the great\r\nGovernment of this Country shall protect Slavery in any Territory now\r\nours, or hereafter to be acquired.  It is, in my opinion, a great\r\nprinciple of Free Government, not, to be surrendered.\r\n\r\n\"It is in my judgment, the object of the great battle which we have\r\nfought, and which we have won.  It is, in my poor opinion, the point\r\nupon which there is concord and agreement between the great masses of\r\nthe North, who may agree in no other political opinion whatever.  Be he\r\nRepublican, or Democrat, or Douglas man, or Lincoln man; be he from the\r\nNorth, or the West, from Oregon, or from Maine, in my judgment\r\nnine-tenths of the entire population of the North and West are devoted,\r\nin the very depths of their hearts, to the great Constitutional idea\r\nthat Freedom is the rule, that Slavery is the exception, that it ought\r\nnot to be extended by virtue of the powers of the Government of the\r\nUnited States; and, come weal, come woe, it never shall be.\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, I add one other thing.  When you talk to me about Compromise\r\nor Concession, I am not sure that I always understand you.  Do you mean\r\nthat I am to give up my convictions of right?  Armies cannot compel that\r\nin the breast of a Free People.  Do you mean that I am to concede the\r\nbenefits of the political struggle through which we have passed,\r\nconsidered politically, only?  You are too just and too generous to ask\r\nthat.  Do you mean that we are to deny the great principle upon which\r\nour political action has been based?  You know we cannot.  But if you\r\nmean by Compromise and Concession to ask us to see whether we have not\r\nbeen hasty, angry, passionate, excited, and in many respects violated\r\nyour feelings, your character, your right of property, we will look;\r\nand, as I said yesterday, if we have, we will undo it.  Allow me to say\r\nagain, if there be any lawyer or any Court that will advise us that our\r\nlaws are unconstitutional, we will repeal them.\r\n\r\n\"Now as to territory.  I will not yield one inch to Secession; but there\r\nare things that I will yield, and there are things to which I will\r\nyield.  It is somewhere told that when Harold of England received a\r\nmessenger from a brother with whom he was at variance, to inquire on\r\nwhat terms reconciliation and peace could be effected between brothers,\r\nhe replied in a gallant and generous spirit in a few words, 'the terms\r\nI offer are the affection of a brother; and the Earldom of\r\nNorthumberland.'  And, said the Envoy, as he marched up the Hall amid\r\nthe warriors that graced the state of the King, 'if Tosti, thy brother,\r\nagree to this, what terms will you allow to his ally and friend,\r\nHadrada, the giant.'  'We will allow,' said Harold, 'to Hadrada, the\r\ngiant, seven feet of English ground, and if he be, as they say, a giant,\r\nsome few inches more!' and, as he spake, the Hall rang with acclamation.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, in that spirit I speak.  I follow, at a humble distance, the ideas\r\nand the words of Clay, illustrious, to be venerated, and honored, and\r\nremembered, forever.  * * *  He said--I say: that I will yield no inch,\r\nno word, to the threat of Secession, unconstitutional, revolutionary,\r\ndangerous, unwise, at variance with the heart and the hope of all\r\nmankind save themselves.  To that I yield nothing; but if States loyal\r\nto the Constitution, if people magnanimous and just, desiring a return\r\nof fraternal feeling, shall come to us and ask for Peace, for permanent,\r\nenduring peace and affection, and say, 'What will you grant?  I say to\r\nthem, 'Ask all that a gentleman ought to propose, and I will yield all\r\nthat a gentleman ought to offer.'  Nay, more: if you are galled because\r\nwe claim the right to prohibit Slavery in territory now Free, or in any\r\nTerritory which acknowledges our jurisdiction, we will evade--I speak\r\nbut for myself--I will aid in evading that question; I will agree to\r\nmake it all States, and let the People decide at once.  I will agree to\r\nplace them in that condition where the prohibition of Slavery will never\r\nbe necessary to justify ourselves to our consciences or to our\r\nconstituents.  I will agree to anything which is not to force upon me\r\nthe necessity of protecting Slavery in the name of Freedom.  To that I\r\nnever can and never will yield.\"\r\n\r\nThe speeches of Seward, of Douglas, of Crittenden, of Andrew Johnson, of\r\nBaker, and others, in behalf of the Union, and those of Benjamin, Davis,\r\nWigfall, Lane, and others, in behalf of Secession, did much toward\r\nfixing the responsibility for the approaching bloody conflict where it\r\nbelonged.  The speeches of Andrew Johnson of Tennessee--who, if he at a\r\nsubsequent period of the Nation's history, proved himself not the\r\nworthiest son of the Republic, at this critical time, at all events, did\r\ngrand service in the National Senate--especially had great and good\r\neffect on the public mind in the Northern and Border States.  They were,\r\ntherefore, gall and wormwood to the Secession leaders, who hoped to drag\r\nthe Border States into the great Southern Confederacy of States already\r\nin process of formation.\r\n\r\nTheir irritation was shown in threats of personal violence to Mr.\r\nJohnson, as when Wigfall--replying February 7th, 1861, to the latter's\r\nspeech, said, \"Now if the Senator wishes to denounce Secession and\r\nNullification eo nomine, let him go back and denounce Jefferson; let him\r\ndenounce Jackson, if he dare, and go back and look that Tennessee\r\nDemocracy in the face, and see whether they will content themselves with\r\nriddling his effigy!\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem also, from another part of Wigfall's reply, that the\r\nspeeches of Union Senators had been so effective that a necessity was\r\nfelt on the part of the Southern Conspirators to still further attempt\r\nto justify Secession by shifting the blame to Northern shoulders, for,\r\nwhile referring to the Presidential canvass of 1860--and the attitude of\r\nthe Southern Secession leaders during that exciting period--he said:\r\n\"We (Breckinridge-Democrats) gave notice, both North and South, that if\r\nAbraham Lincoln was elected, this Union was dissolved.  I never made a\r\nspeech during the canvass without asserting that fact.  * * *  Then, I\r\nsay, that our purpose was not to dissolve the Union; but the dire\r\nnecessity has been put upon us.  The question is, whether we shall live\r\nlonger in a Union in which a Party, hostile to us in every respect, has\r\nthe power in Congress, in the Executive department, and in the Electoral\r\nColleges--a Party who will have the power even in the Judiciary.  We\r\nthink it is not safe.  We say that each State has the clear indisputable\r\nright to withdraw if she sees fit; and six of the States have already\r\nwithdrawn, and one other State is upon the eve of withdrawing, if she\r\nhas not already done so.  How far this will spread no man can tell!\"\r\n\r\nAs tending to show the peculiar mixture of brag, cajolery, and threats,\r\ninvolved in the attitude of the South, as expressed by the same favorite\r\nSouthern mouthpiece, toward the Border-States on the one hand, and the\r\nMiddle and New England States on the other, a further extract from this\r\n(February 7th) speech of the Texan Senator may be of interest.  Said he:\r\n\r\n\"With exports to the amount of hundreds of millions of dollars, our\r\nimports must be the same.  With a lighter Tariff than any people ever\r\nundertook to live under, we could have larger revenue.  We would be able\r\nto stand Direct Taxation to a greater extent than any people ever could\r\nbefore, since the creation of the World.  We feel perfectly competent to\r\nmeet all issues that may be presented, either by hostility from abroad\r\nor treason at home.  So far as the Border-States are concerned, it is a\r\nmatter that concerns them alone.  Should they confederate with us,\r\nbeyond all doubt New England machinery will be worked with the water\r\npower of Tennessee, of Kentucky, of Virginia and of Maryland; the Tariff\r\nlaws that now give New England the monopoly in the thirty-three States,\r\nwill give to these Border States a monopoly in the Slave-holding States.\r\nShould the non-Slave-holding States choose to side against us in\r\norganizing their Governments, and cling to their New England brethren,\r\nthe only result will be, that the meat, the horses, the hemp, and the\r\ngrain, which we now buy in Pennsylvania, in Ohio, in Indiana and\r\nIllinois, will be purchased in Kentucky and in Western Virginia and in\r\nMissouri.  Should Pennsylvania stand out, the only result will be, that\r\nthe iron which is now dug in Pennsylvania, will be dug in the mountains\r\nof Tennessee and of Virginia and of Kentucky and of North Carolina.\r\nThese things we know.\r\n\r\n\"We feel no anxiety at all, so far as money or men are concerned.  We\r\ndesire War with nobody; we intend to make no War; but we intend to live\r\nunder just such a Government as we see fit.  Six States have left this\r\nUnion, and others are going to leave it simply because they choose to do\r\nit; that is all.  We do not ask your consent; we do not wish it.  We\r\nhave revoked our ratification of the Treaty commonly known as the\r\nConstitution of the United States; a treaty for common defense and\r\ngeneral welfare; and we shall be perfectly willing to enter into another\r\nTreaty with you, of peace and amity.  Reject the olive branch and offer\r\nus the sword, and we accept it; we have not the slightest objection.\r\nUpon that subject we feel as the great William Lowndes felt upon another\r\nimportant subject, the Presidency, which he said was neither to be\r\nsought nor declined.  When you invade our soil, look to your own\r\nborders.  You say that you have too many people, too many towns, too\r\ndense a population, for us to invade you.  I say to you Senators, that\r\nthere is nothing that ever stops the march of an invading force, except\r\na desert.  The more populous a country, the more easy it is to subsist\r\nan army.\"\r\n\r\nAfter declaring that--\"Not only are our non-Slaveholders loyal, but even\r\nour Negroes are.  We have no apprehensions whatever of insurrection--not\r\nthe slightest.  We can arm our negroes, and leave them at home, when we\r\nare temporarily absent\"--Mr. Wigfall proceeded to say: \"We may as well\r\ntalk plainly about this matter.  This is probably the last time I shall\r\nhave an opportunity of addressing you.  There is another thing that an\r\ninvading army cannot do.  It cannot burn up plantations.  You can pull\r\ndown fences, but the Negroes will put them up the next morning.  The\r\nworst fuel that ever a man undertook to make fire with, is dirt; it will\r\nnot burn.  Now I have told you what an invading army cannot do.  Suppose\r\nI reverse the picture and tell you what it can do.  An invading army in\r\nan enemy's country, where there is a dense population, can subsist\r\nitself at a very little cost; it does not always pay for what it gets.\r\nAn invading army can burn down towns; an invading army can burn down\r\nmanufactories; and it can starve operatives.  It can do all these\r\nthings.  But an Invading army, and an army to defend a Country, both\r\nrequire a military chest.  You may bankrupt every man south of North\r\nCarolina, so that his credit is reduced to such a point that he could\r\nnot discount a note for thirty dollars, at thirty days; but the next\r\nautumn those Cotton States will have just as much money and as much\r\ncredit as they had before.  They pick money off the cotton plant.  Every\r\ntime that a Negro touches a cotton-pod with his hand, he pulls a piece\r\nof silver out of it, and he drops it into the basket in which it is\r\ncarried to the gin-house.  It is carried to the packing screw.  A bale\r\nof cotton rolls out-in other words, five ten-dollar pieces roll out\r\n--covered with canvas.  We shall never again make less than five million\r\nbales of cotton.  * * *  We can produce five million bales of cotton,\r\nevery bale worth fifty dollars, which is the lowest market price it has\r\nbeen for years past.  We shall import a bale of something else, for\r\nevery bale of cotton that we export, and that bale will be worth fifty\r\ndollars.  We shall find no difficulty under a War-Tariff in raising an\r\nabundance of money.  We have been at Peace for a very long time, We are\r\nvery prosperous.  Our planters use their cotton, not to buy the\r\nnecessaries of life, but for the superfluities, which they can do\r\nwithout.  The States themselves have a mine of wealth in the loyalty and\r\nthe wealth of their citizens.  Georgia, Mississippi, any one of those\r\nStates can issue its six per cent. bonds tomorrow, and receive cotton in\r\npayment to the extent almost of the entire crop.  They can first borrow\r\nfrom their own citizens; they can tax them to an almost unlimited\r\nextent; and they can raise revenue from a Tariff to an almost unlimited\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\"How will it be with New England?  where will their revenue come from?\r\nFrom your Custom-houses?  what do you export?  You have been telling us\r\nhere for the last quarter of a century, that you cannot manufacture,\r\neven for the home market, under the Tariffs which we have given you.\r\nWhen this Tariff ceases to operate in your favor, and you have to pay\r\nfor coming into our markets, what will you export?  When your machinery\r\nceases to move, and your operatives are turned out, will you tax your\r\nbroken capitalist or your starving operative?  When the navigation laws\r\ncease to operate, what will become of your shipping interest?  You are\r\ngoing to blockade our ports, you say.  That is a very innocent game; and\r\nyou suppose we shall sit quietly down and submit to a blockade.  I speak\r\nnot of foreign interference, for we look not for it.  We are just as\r\ncompetent to take Queen Victoria and Louis Napoleon under our\r\nprotection, as they are to take us; and they are a great deal more\r\ninterested to-day in receiving cotton from our ports than we are in\r\nshipping it.  You may lock up every bale of cotton within the limits of\r\nthe eight Cotton States, and not allow us to export one for three years,\r\nand we shall not feel it further than our military resources are\r\nconcerned.  Exhaust the supply of cotton in Europe for one week, and all\r\nEurope is in revolution.\r\n\r\n\"These are facts.  You will blockade us!  Do you suppose we shall do\r\nnothing, even upon the sea?  How many letters of marque and reprisal\r\nwould it take to put the whole of your ships up at your wharves to rot?\r\nWill any merchant at Havre, or Liverpool, or any other portion of the\r\nhabitable globe, ship a cargo upon a New England, or New York, or\r\nPhiladelphia clipper, or other ship, when he knows that the seas are\r\nswarming with letters of marque and reprisal?  Why the mere apprehension\r\nof such a thing will cut you out of the Carrying Trade of the civilized\r\nWorld.  * * *  I speak not of the absurdity of the position that you can\r\nblockade our ports, admitting at the same time that we are in the Union.\r\nBlockade is a remedy, as all writers on International law say, against a\r\nForeign Power with whom you are at War.  You cannot use a blockade\r\nagainst your own people.  An embargo even, you cannot use.  That is a\r\nremedy against a Foreign Nation with whom you expect to be at War.  You\r\nmust treat us as in the Union, or out of it.  We have gone out.  We are\r\nwilling to live at peace with you; but, as sure as fate, whenever any\r\nflag comes into one of our ports, that has thirty-three stars upon it,\r\nthat flag will be fired at.  Displaying a flag with stars which we have\r\nplucked from that bright galaxy, is an insult to the State within whose\r\nwaters that flag is displayed.  You cannot enforce the laws without\r\nCoercion, and you cannot Coerce without War.\r\n\r\n\"These matters, then, can be settled.  How?  By withdrawing your troops;\r\nadmitting our right to Self-government clearly, unqualifiedly.  Do this,\r\nand there is no difficulty about it.  You say that you will not do it.\r\nVery well; we have no objection--none whatever.  That is Coercion.  When\r\nyou have attempted it, you will find that you have made War.  These,\r\nSenators, are facts.  I come here to plead for Peace; but I have seen so\r\nmuch and felt so much, that I am becoming at last, to tell the plain\r\ntruth of the matter, rather indifferent as to which way the thing turns.\r\nIf you want War, you can have it.  If you want Peace, you can get it;\r\nbut I plead not for Peace.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Seceding States of the South were strengthening their\r\nattitude by Confederation.  On February 4, 1861, the Convention of\r\nSeceding States, called by the South Carolina Convention at the time of\r\nher Secession, met, in pursuance of that call, at Montgomery, Alabama,\r\nand on the 9th adopted a Provisional Constitution and organized a\r\nProvisional Government by the election of Jefferson Davis of\r\nMississippi, as President, and Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia, as\r\nVice-President; to serve until a Presidential election could be held by\r\nthe people of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n     [At a later day, March 11, 1861, a permanent Constitution for the\r\n     \"Confederate States\" was adopted, and, in the Fall of the same\r\n     year, Messrs.  Davis and Stephens were elected by popular vote, for\r\n     the term of six years ensuing, as President and Vice-President,\r\n     respectively, of the Confederacy.]\r\n\r\nMr. Davis almost at once left Jackson, Mississippi, for Montgomery,\r\nwhere he arrived and delivered his Inaugural, February 17, having\r\nreceived on his road thither a succession of ovations from the\r\nenthusiastic Rebels, to which he had responded with no less than\r\ntwenty-five speeches, very similar in tone to those made in the United\r\nStates Senate by Mr. Wigfall and others of that ilk--breathing at once\r\ndefiance and hopefulness, while admitting the difficulties in the way\r\nof the new Confederacy.\r\n\r\n\"It may be,\" said he, at Jackson, \"that we will be confronted by War;\r\nthat the attempt will be made to blockade our ports, to starve us out;\r\nbut they (the Union men of the North) know little of the Southern heart,\r\nof Southern endurance.  No amount of privation could force us to remain\r\nin a Union on unequal terms.  England and France would not allow our\r\ngreat staple to be dammed up within our present limits; the starving\r\nthousands in their midst would not allow it.  We have nothing to\r\napprehend from Blockade.  But if they attempt invasion by land, we must\r\ntake the War out of our territory.  If War must come, it must be upon\r\nNorthern, and not upon Southern soil.  In the meantime, if they were\r\nprepared to grant us Peace, to recognize our equality, all is well.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in his speech at Stevenson, Alabama, said he \"Your Border States\r\nwill gladly come into the Southern Confederacy within sixty days, as we\r\nwill be their only friends.  England will recognize us, and a glorious\r\nfuture is before us.  The grass will grow in the Northern cities, where\r\nthe pavements have been worn off by the tread of Commerce.  We will\r\ncarry War where it is easy to advance--where food for the sword and\r\ntorch await our Armies in the densely populated cities; and though they\r\nmay come and spoil our crops, we can raise them as before; while they\r\ncannot rear the cities which took years of industry and millions of\r\nmoney to build.\"\r\n\r\nVery different in tone to these, were the kindly and sensible utterances\r\nof Mr. Lincoln on his journey from Springfield to Washington, about the\r\nsame time, for Inauguration as President of the United States.  Leaving\r\nSpringfield, Illinois, February 11th, he had pathetically said:\r\n\r\n\"My friends: No one, not in my position, can realize the sadness I feel\r\nat this parting.  To this people I owe all that I am.  Here I have lived\r\nmore than a quarter of a century.  Here my children were born, and here\r\none of them lies buried.  I know not how soon I shall see you again.  I\r\ngo to assume a task more difficult than that which has devolved upon any\r\nother man since the days of Washington.  He never would have succeeded\r\nexcept for the aid of Divine Providence, upon which he at all times\r\nrelied.  I feel that I cannot succeed without the same Divine blessing\r\nwhich sustained him; and on the same Almighty Being I place my reliance\r\nfor support.  And I hope you, my friends, will all pray that I may\r\nreceive that Divine assistance, without which I cannot succeed, but with\r\nwhich success is certain.  Again I bid you an affectionate farewell.\"\r\n\r\nAt Indianapolis, that evening, the eve of his birthday anniversary,\r\nafter thanking the assembled thousands for their \"magnificent welcome,\"\r\nand defining the words \"Coercion\" and \"Invasion\"--at that time so\r\nloosely used--he continued: \"But if the United States should merely hold\r\nand retake her own Forts and other property, and collect the duties on\r\nforeign importation, or even withhold the mails from places where they\r\nwere habitually violated, would any or all of these things be 'Invasion'\r\nor 'Coercion'?  Do our professed lovers of the Union, who spitefully\r\nresolve that they will resist Coercion and Invasion, understand that\r\nsuch things as these on the part of the United States would be\r\n'Coercion' or 'Invasion' of a State?  If so, their idea of means to\r\npreserve the object of their great affection would seem to be\r\nexceedingly thin and airy.\"\r\n\r\nAt Columbus, Ohio, he spoke in a like calm, conservative, reasoning way\r\n--with the evident purpose of throwing oil on the troubled waters--when\r\nhe said: \"I have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety.\r\nIt is a good thing that there is no more than anxiety; for there is\r\nnothing going wrong.  It is a consoling circumstance that, when we look\r\nout, there is nothing that really hurts anybody.  We entertain different\r\nviews upon political questions; but nobody is suffering anything.  This\r\nis a consoling circumstance; and from it we may conclude that all we\r\nwant is time, patience, and a reliance on that God who has never\r\nforsaken this People.\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, at Pittsburg, Pa., February 15th, he said, of \"our friends,\" as\r\nhe termed them, the Secessionists: \"Take even their own views of the\r\nquestions involved, and there is nothing to justify the course they are\r\npursuing.  I repeat, then, there is no crisis, except such an one as may\r\nbe gotten up at any time by turbulent men, aided by designing\r\npoliticians.  My advice to them, under the circumstances, is to keep\r\ncool.  If the great American People only keep their temper both sides of\r\nthe line, the trouble will come to an end, and the question which now\r\ndistracts the Country be settled, just as surely as all other\r\ndifficulties, of a like character, which have been originated in this\r\nGovernment, have been adjusted.  Let the people on both sides keep their\r\nself-possession, and, just as other clouds have cleared away in due\r\ntime, so will this great Nation continue to prosper as heretofore.\"\r\n\r\nAnd toward the end of that journey, on the 22nd of February\r\n--Washington's Birthday--in the Independence Hall at Philadelphia, after\r\neloquently affirming his belief that \"the great principle or idea that\r\nkept this Confederacy so long together was * * * that sentiment in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence which gave Liberty not alone to the People\r\nof this Country, but\" he hoped \"to the World, for all future time * * *\r\nwhich gave promise that, in due time, the weight would be lifted from\r\nthe shoulders of all men\"--he added, in the same firm, yet temperate and\r\nreassuring vein: \"Now, my friends, can this Country be saved on that\r\nbasis?  If it can, I will consider myself one of the happiest men in the\r\nworld, if I can help to save it.  If it cannot be saved on that basis,\r\nit will be truly awful.  But, if this Country cannot be saved without\r\ngiving up that principle, I was about to say I would rather be\r\nassassinated on this spot than surrender it.  Now in my view of the\r\npresent aspect of affairs, there need be no bloodshed or War.  There is\r\nno necessity for it.  I am not in favor of such a course; and I may say,\r\nin advance, that there will be no bloodshed, unless it be forced upon\r\nthe Government, and then it will be compelled to act in self-defense.  *\r\n* * I have said nothing but what I am willing to live by, and, if it be\r\nthe pleasure of Almighty God, to die by.\"\r\n\r\nThus, as he progressed on that memorable journey from his home in\r\nIllinois, through Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Columbus, Pittsburgh,\r\nCleveland, Erie, Buffalo, Albany, New York, Trenton, Newark,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Harrisburg-amid the prayers and blessings and\r\nacclamations of an enthusiastic and patriotic people--he uttered words\r\nof wise conciliation and firm moderation such as beseemed the high\r\nfunctions and tremendous responsibilities to which the voice of that\r\nliberty--and-union-loving people had called him, and this too, with a\r\nfull knowledge, when he made the Philadelphia speech, that the enemies\r\nof the Republic had already planned to assassinate him before he could\r\nreach Washington.\r\n\r\nThe prudence of his immediate friends, fortunately defeated the\r\nmurderous purpose--and by the simple device of taking the regular night\r\nexpress from Philadelphia instead of a special train next day--to\r\nWashington, he reached the National Capital without molestation early on\r\nthe morning of the 23rd of February.\r\n\r\nThat morning, after Mr. Lincoln's arrival, in company with Mr. Lovejoy,\r\nthe writer visited him at Willard's Hotel.  During the interview both\r\nurged him to \"Go right along, protect the property of the Country, and\r\nput down the Rebellion, no matter at what cost in men and money.\"  He\r\nlistened with grave attention, and said little, but very clearly\r\nindicated his approval of all the sentiments thus expressed--and then,\r\nwith the same firm and manly and cheerful faith in the outcome, he\r\nadded: \"As the Country has placed me at the helm of the Ship, I'll try\r\nto steer her through.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit in which he proposed to accomplish this superhuman task, was\r\nshown when he told the Southern people through the Civic authorities of\r\nWashington on the 27th of February--When the latter called upon him\r\n--that he had no desire or intention to interfere with any of their\r\nConstitutional rights--that they should have all their rights under the\r\nConstitution, \"not grudgingly, but fully and fairly.\"  And what was the\r\nresponse of the South to this generous and conciliatory message?\r\nPersonal sneers--imputations of Northern cowardice--boasts of Southern\r\nprowess--scornful rejection of all compromise--and an insolent challenge\r\nto the bloody issue of arms!\r\n\r\nSaid Mr. Wigfall, in the United States Senate, on March 2d, alluding to\r\nMr. Lincoln, \"I do not think that a man who disguises himself in a\r\nsoldier's cloak and a Scotch cap (a more thorough disguise could not be\r\nassumed by such a man) and makes his entry between day and day, into the\r\nCapital of the Country that he is to govern--I hardly think that he is\r\ngoing to look War sternly in the face.\r\n\r\n     [Had Mr. Wigfall been able at this time to look four years into the\r\n     future and behold the downfall of the Southern Rebellion, the\r\n     flight of its Chieftains, and the capture of Jefferson Davis while\r\n     endeavoring to escape, with his body enclosed in a wrapper and a\r\n     woman's shawl over his head, as stated by Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart\r\n     of Jefferson Davis's Staff, p. 756, vol. ii., Greeley's American\r\n     Conflict--he would hardly have retailed this slander.]\r\n\r\n\"I look for nothing else than that the Commissioners from the\r\nConfederated States will be received here and recognized by Abraham\r\nLincoln.  I will now predict that this Republican Party that is going to\r\nenforce the Laws, preserve the Union, and collect Revenue, will never\r\nattempt anything so silly; and that instead of taking Forts, the troops\r\nwill be withdrawn from those which we now have.  See if this does not\r\nturn out to be so, in less than a week or ten days.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same insulting diatribe, he said: \"It is very easy for men to\r\nbluster who know there is going to be no danger.  Four or five million\r\npeople living in a territory that extends from North Carolina down to\r\nthe Rio Grande, who have exports to above three hundred million dollars,\r\nwhose ports cannot be blockaded, but who can issue letters of marque and\r\nreprisal, and sweep your commerce from the seas, and who will do it, are\r\nnot going to be trifled with by that sensible Yankee nation.  Mark my\r\nwords.  I did think, at one time, there was going to be War; I do not\r\nthink so now.  * * *  The Star of the West swaggered into Charleston\r\nharbor, received a blow planted full in the face, and staggered out.\r\nYour flag has been insulted; redress it if you dare!  You have submitted\r\nto it for two months, and you will submit to it for ever.  * * *  We\r\nhave dissolved the Union; mend it if you can; cement it with blood; try\r\nthe experiment! we do not desire War; we wish to avoid it.  * * *  This\r\nwe say; and if you choose to settle this question by the Sword, we feel,\r\nwe know, that we have the Right.  We interfere with you in no way.  We\r\nask simply that you will not interfere with us.  * * *  You tell us you\r\nwill keep us in the Union.  Try the experiment!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, with brutal frankness, he continued: \"Now, whether what are\r\ncalled The Crittenden Resolutions will produce satisfaction in some of\r\nthese Border States, or not, I am unaware; but I feel perfectly sure\r\nthey would not be entertained upon the Gulf.  As to the Resolutions\r\nwhich the Peace Congress has offered us, we might as well make a clean\r\nbreast of it.  If those Resolutions were adopted, and ratified by three\r\nfourths of the States of this Union, and no other cause ever existed, I\r\nmake the assertion that the seven States now out of the Union, would go\r\nout upon that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                       THE REJECTED OLIVE BRANCH.\r\n\r\nWhile instructive, it will also not be devoid of interest, to pause\r\nhere, and examine the nature of the Crittenden Resolutions, and also the\r\nResolutions of the Peace Congress, which, we have seen, were spurned by\r\nthe Secession leaders, through their chief mouthpiece in the United\r\nStates Senate.\r\n\r\nThe Crittenden Compromise Resolutions * were in these words:\r\n\r\n\"A Joint Resolution proposing certain Amendments to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, serious and alarming dissensions have arisen between the\r\nNorthern and the Southern States, concerning the Rights and security of\r\nthe Rights of the Slaveholding States, and especially their Rights in\r\nthe common territory of the United States; and whereas, it is eminently\r\ndesirable and proper that these dissensions, which now threaten the very\r\nexistence of this Union, should be permanently quieted and settled by\r\nConstitutional provisions which shall do equal justice to all Sections,\r\nand thereby restore to the People that peace and good-will which ought\r\nto prevail between all the citizens of the United States; Therefore:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America, in Congress assembled, (two thirds of both Houses\r\nconcurring), the following articles be, and are hereby proposed and\r\nsubmitted as amendments to the Constitution of the United States, which\r\nshall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of said\r\nConstitution, when ratified by Conventions of three-fourths of the\r\nseveral States:\r\n\r\n\"Article I.  In all the territory of the United States now held, or\r\nhereafter to be acquired, situate north of latitude 36  30', Slavery or\r\ninvoluntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, is prohibited,\r\nwhile such territory shall remain under Territorial government.  In all\r\nthe territory south of said line of latitude, Slavery of the African\r\nrace is hereby recognized as existing, and shall not be interfered with\r\nby Congress, but shall be protected as Property by all the departments\r\nof the Territorial government during its continuance.  And when any\r\nTerritory, north or south of said line, within such boundaries as\r\nCongress may prescribe, shall contain the population requisite for a\r\nmember of Congress, according to the then Federal ratio of\r\nrepresentation of the People of the United States, it shall, if its own\r\nform of government be republican, be admitted into the Union, on an\r\nequal footing with the original States; with or without Slavery, as the\r\nConstitution of such new State may provide.\r\n\r\n\"Article II.  Congress shall have no power to abolish Slavery in places\r\nunder its exclusive jurisdiction, and situate within the limits of\r\nStates that permit the holding of Slaves.\r\n\r\n\"Article III.  Congress shall have no power to abolish Slavery within\r\nthe District of Columbia; so long as it exists in the adjoining States\r\nof Virginia and Maryland, or either, nor without the consent of the\r\ninhabitants, nor without just compensation first made to such owners of\r\nSlaves as do not consent to such abolishment.  Nor shall Congress, at\r\nany time, prohibit officers of the Federal government, or members of\r\nCongress whose duties require them to be in said District, from bringing\r\nwith them their Slaves, and holding them as such during the time their\r\nduties may require them to remain there, and afterward taking them from\r\nthe District.\r\n\r\n\"Article IV.  Congress shall have no power to prohibit or hinder the\r\nTransportation of Slaves from one State to another, or to a Territory in\r\nwhich Slaves are, by law, permitted to be held, whether that\r\ntransportation be by land, navigable rivers, or by the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Article V.  That in addition to the provisions of the third paragraph\r\nof the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, Congress shall have power to provide by law, and it shall\r\nbe its duty to provide, that the United States shall pay to the owner\r\nwho shall apply for it, the full value of his Fugitive Slaves in all\r\ncases where the Marshal, or other officer whose duty it was to arrest\r\nsaid Fugitive, was prevented from so doing by violence or intimidation,\r\nor where, after arrest, said Fugitive was rescued by force, and the\r\nowner thereby prevented and obstructed in the pursuit of his remedy for\r\nthe recovery of his Fugitive Slave under the said clause of the\r\nConstitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof.\r\n\r\n     [\"No Person held to Service or Labour in one State, under the Laws\r\n     thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any Law or\r\n     Regulation therein, be discharged from such Service or Labour, but\r\n     shall be delivered up on claim of the Party to whom such Service or\r\n     Labour may be due.\"--Art.  IV., Sec.  2, P 3, U. S. Constitution.]\r\n\r\n\"And in all such cases, when the United States shall pay for such\r\nFugitive, they shall have the Right, in their own name, to sue the\r\ncounty in which said violence, intimidation, or rescue, was committed,\r\nand recover from it, with interest and damages, the amount paid by them\r\nfor said Fugitive Slave.  And the said county, after it has paid said\r\namount to the United States, may, for its indemnity, sue and recover\r\nfrom the wrong-doers or rescuers by whom the owner was prevented from\r\nthe recovery of his Fugitive Slave, in like manner as the owner himself\r\nmight have sued and recovered.\r\n\r\n\"Article VI.  No future amendment of the Constitution shall affect the\r\nfive preceding articles; nor the third paragraph of the second section\r\nof the first article of the Constitution, nor the third paragraph  of\r\nthe second section of the fourth article of said Constitution; and no\r\namendment shall be made to the Constitution which shall authorize or\r\ngive to Congress any power to abolish or interfere with Slavery in any\r\nof the States by whose laws it is or may be, allowed or permitted.\r\n\r\n     [\"Representatives and Direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the\r\n     several States which may be included within this Union, according\r\n     to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to\r\n     the whole Number of Free Persons, including those bound to Service\r\n     for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not Taxed, three-fifths\r\n     of all Other Persons,\" etc.--Art. 1., Sec.  2, P 3, U. S.\r\n     Constitution.]\r\n\r\n\"And whereas, also, besides those causes of dissension embraced in the\r\nforegoing amendments proposed to the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthere are others which come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and may\r\nbe remedied by its legislative power; And whereas it is the desire of\r\nCongress, as far as its power will extend, to remove all just cause for\r\nthe popular discontent and agitation which now disturb the peace of the\r\nCountry and threaten the stability of its Institutions; Therefore:\r\n\r\n\"1.  Resolved by the Senate and house of Representatives in Congress\r\nassembled, that the laws now in force for the recovery of Fugitive\r\nSlaves are in strict pursuance of the plain and mandatory provisions of\r\nthe Constitution, and have been sanctioned as valid and Constitutional\r\nby the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States; that the\r\nSlaveholding States are entitled to the faithful observance and\r\nexecution of those laws; and that they ought not to be repealed, or so\r\nmodified or changed as to impair their efficiency; and that laws ought\r\nto be made for the punishment of those who attempt, by rescue of the\r\nSlave, or other illegal means, to hinder or defeat the due execution of\r\nsaid laws.\r\n\r\n\"2.  That all State laws which conflict with the Fugitive Slave Acts of\r\nCongress, or any other Constitutional Acts of Congress, or which, in\r\ntheir operation, impede, hinder, or delay, the free course and due\r\nexecution of any of said Acts, are null and void by the plain provisions\r\nof the Constitution of the United States; yet those State laws, void as\r\nthey are, have given color to practices, and led to consequences, which\r\nhave obstructed the due administration and execution of Acts of\r\nCongress, and especially the Acts for the delivery of Fugitive Slaves;\r\nand have thereby contributed much to the discord and commotion now\r\nprevailing.  Congress, therefore, in the present perilous juncture, does\r\nnot deem it improper, respectfully and earnestly, to recommend the\r\nrepeal of those laws to the several States which have enacted them, or\r\nsuch legislative corrections or explanations of them as may prevent\r\ntheir being used or perverted to such mischievous purposes.\r\n\r\n\"3.  That the Act of the 18th of September, 1850, commonly called the\r\nFugitive Slave Law, ought to be so amended as to make the fee of the\r\nCommissioner, mentioned in the eighth section of the Act, equal in\r\namount in the cases decided by him, whether his decision be in favor of,\r\nor against the claimant.  And, to avoid misconstruction, the last clause\r\nof the fifth section of said Act, which authorizes the person holding a\r\nwarrant for the arrest or detention of a Fugitive Slave to summon to his\r\naid the posse comitatus, and which declares it to be the duty of all\r\ngood citizens to assist him in its execution, ought to be so amended as\r\nto expressly limit the authority and duty to cases in which there shall\r\nbe resistance, or danger of resistance or rescue.\r\n\r\n\"4.  That the laws for the suppression of the African Slave Trade, and\r\nespecially those prohibiting the importation of Slaves into the United\r\nStates, ought to be more effectual, and ought to be thoroughly executed;\r\nand all further enactments necessary to those ends ought to be promptly\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peace Conference, or \"Congress,\" it may here be mentioned, was\r\ncalled, by action of the Legislature of Virginia, to meet at Washington,\r\nFebruary 4, 1861.  The invitation was extended to all of such \"States of\r\nthis Confederacy * * *  whether Slaveholding or Non-Slaveholding, as are\r\nwilling to unite with Virginia in an earnest effort to adjust the\r\npresent unhappy controversies in the spirit in which the Constitution\r\nwas originally formed, and consistently with its principles, so as to\r\nafford to the people of the Slaveholding States adequate guarantees for\r\nthe security of their rights\"--such States to be represented by\r\nCommissioners \"to consider, and, if practicable, agree upon some\r\nsuitable adjustment.\"\r\n\r\nThe Conference, or \"Congress,\" duly convened, at that place and time,\r\nand organized by electing ex-President John Tyler, of Virginia, its\r\nPresident.  This Peace Congress--which comprised 133 Commissioners,\r\nrepresenting the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Kansas--remained in session until\r\nFebruary 27, 1861--and then submitted the result of its labors to\r\nCongress, with the request that Congress \"will submit it to Conventions\r\nin the States, as Article Thirteen of the Amendments to the Constitution\r\nof the United States, in the following shape:\r\n\r\n\"Section 1.  In all the present territory of the United States, north of\r\nthe parallel of 36  30' of north latitude, Involuntary Servitude, except\r\nin punishment of crime, is prohibited.  In all the present territory\r\nsouth of that line, the status of Persons held to Involuntary Service or\r\nLabor, as it now exists, shall not be changed; nor shall any law be\r\npassed by Congress or the Territorial Legislature to hinder or prevent\r\nthe taking of such Persons from any of the States of this Union to said\r\nTerritory, nor to impair the Rights arising from said relation; but the\r\nsame shall be subject to judicial cognizance in the Federal Courts,\r\naccording to the course of the common law.  When any Territory north or\r\nsouth of said line, within such boundary as Congress may prescribe,\r\nshall contain a population equal to that required for a member of\r\nCongress, it shall, if its form of government be republican, be admitted\r\ninto the Union on an equal footing with the original States, with or\r\nwithout Involuntary Servitude, as the Constitution of such State may\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\n\"Section 2.  No territory shall be acquired by the United States, except\r\nby discovery and for naval and commercial stations, depots, and transit\r\nroutes, without the concurrence of a majority of all the Senators from\r\nStates which allow Involuntary Servitude, and a majority of all the\r\nSenators from States which prohibit that relation; nor shall Territory\r\nbe acquired by treaty, unless the votes of a majority of the Senators\r\nfrom each class of States hereinbefore mentioned be cast as a part of\r\nthe two-thirds majority necessary to the ratification of such treaty.\r\n\r\n\"Section 3.  Neither the Constitution, nor any amendment thereof, shall\r\nbe construed to give Congress power to regulate, abolish, or control,\r\nwithin any State, the relation established or recognized by the laws\r\nthereof touching Persons held to Labor or Involuntary Service therein,\r\nnor to interfere with or abolish Involuntary Service in the District of\r\nColumbia without the consent of Maryland, and without the consent of the\r\nowners, or making the owners who do not consent just compensation; nor\r\nthe power to interfere with or prohibit Representatives and others from\r\nbringing with them to the District of Columbia, retaining, and taking\r\naway, Persons so held to Labor or Service; nor the power to interfere\r\nwith or abolish Involuntary Service in places under the exclusive\r\njurisdiction of the United States within those States and Territories\r\nwhere the same is established or recognized; nor the power to prohibit\r\nthe removal or transportation of Persons held to Labor or Involuntary\r\nService in any State or Territory of the United States to any other\r\nState or Territory thereof where it is established or recognized by law\r\nor usage; and the right during transportation, by sea or river, of\r\ntouching at ports, shores, and landings, and of landing in case of\r\ndistress, shall exist; but not the right of transit in or through any\r\nState or Territory, or of sale or traffic, against the laws thereof.\r\nNor shall Congress have power to authorize any higher rate of taxation\r\non Persons held to Labor or Service than on land.  The bringing into the\r\nDistrict of Columbia of Persons held to Labor or Service, for sale, or\r\nplacing them in depots to be afterwards transferred to other places for\r\nsale as merchandize, is prohibited.\r\n\r\n\"Section 4.  The third paragraph of the second section of the fourth\r\narticle of the Constitution shall not be construed to prevent any of the\r\nStates, by appropriate legislation, and through the action of their\r\njudicial and ministerial officers, from enforcing the delivery of\r\nFugitives from Labor to the person to whom such Service or Labor is due.\r\n\r\n\"Section 5.  The Foreign Slave Trade is hereby forever prohibited; and\r\nit shall be the duty of Congress to pass laws to prevent the importation\r\nof Slaves, Coolies, or Persons held to Service or Labor, into the United\r\nStates and the Territories from places beyond the limits thereof.\r\n\r\n\"Section 6.  The first, third, and fifth sections, together with this\r\nsection of these amendments, and the third paragraph of the second\r\nsection of the first article of the Constitution, and the third\r\nparagraph of the second section of the fourth article thereof, shall not\r\nbe amended or abolished without the consent of all the States.\r\n\r\n\"Section 7.  Congress shall provide by law that the United States shall\r\npay to the owner the full value of the Fugitive from Labor, in all cases\r\nwhere the Marshal, or other officer, whose duty it was to arrest such\r\nFugitive, was prevented from so doing by violence or intimidation from\r\nmobs or riotous assemblages, or when, after arrest, such Fugitive was\r\nrescued by like violence or intimidation, and the owner thereby deprived\r\nof the same; and the acceptance of such payment shall preclude the owner\r\nfrom further claim to such Fugitive.  Congress shall provide by law for\r\nsecuring to the citizens of each State the privileges and immunities of\r\ncitizens in the several States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo spurn such propositions as these--with all the concessions to the\r\nSlave Power therein contained--was equivalent to spurning any and all\r\npropositions that could possibly be made; and by doing this, the\r\nSeceding States placed themselves--as they perhaps desired--in an\r\nutterly irreconcilable attitude, and hence, to a certain extent, which\r\nhad not entered into their calculations, weakened their \"Cause\" in the\r\neyes of many of their friends in the North, in the Border States, and in\r\nthe World.  They had become Implacables.  Practically considered, this\r\nwas their great mistake.  The Crittenden Compromise Resolutions covered\r\nand yielded to the Slaveholders of the South all and even more than they\r\nhad ever dared seriously to ask or hope for, and had they been open to\r\nConciliation, they could have undoubtedly carried that measure through\r\nboth Houses of Congress and three-fourths of the States.\r\n\r\n     [\"Its advocates, with good reason, claimed a large majority of the\r\n     People in its favor, and clamored for its submission to a direct\r\n     popular vote.  Had such a submission been accorded, it is very\r\n     likely that the greater number of those who voted at all would have\r\n     voted to ratify it.  * * *  The 'Conservatives,' so called, were\r\n     still able to establish this Crittenden Compromise by their own\r\n     proper strength, had they been disposed so to do.  The President\r\n     was theirs; the Senate strongly theirs; in the House, they had a\r\n     small majority, as was evidenced in their defeat of John Sherman\r\n     for Speaker.  Had they now come forward and said, with authority:\r\n     'Enable us to pass the Crittenden Compromise, and all shall be\r\n     peace and harmony,' they would have succeeded without difficulty.\r\n     It was only through the withdrawal of pro-slavery members that the\r\n     Republicans had achieved an unexpected majority in either House.\r\n     Had those members chosen to return to the seats still awaiting\r\n     them, and to support Mr. Crittenden's proposition, they could have\r\n     carried it without difficulty.\"--Vol. 360, Greeley's Am. Conflict.]\r\n\r\nBut no, they wilfully withdrew their Congressional membership, State by\r\nState, as each Seceded, and refused all terms save those which involved\r\nan absolute surrender to them on all points, including the impossible\r\nclaim of the \"Right of Secession.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly trace the history of the Compromise measures in the\r\ntwo Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Crittenden-Compromise Joint-Resolution had been introduced in the\r\nSenate at the opening of its session and referred to a Select Committee\r\nof Thirteen, and subsequently, January 16th, 1861, having been reported\r\nback, came up in that body for action.  On that day it was amended by\r\ninserting the words \"now held or hereafter to be acquired\" after the\r\nwords \"In all the territory of the United States,\" in the first line of\r\nArticle I., so that it would read as given above.  This amendment--by\r\nwhich not only in all territory then belonging to the United States, but\r\nalso by implication in all that might thereafter be acquired, Slavery\r\nSouth of 36 30' was to be recognized--was agreed to by 29 yeas to 21\r\nnays, as follows:\r\n\r\nYEAS.--Messrs.  Baker, Bayard, Benjamin, Bigler, Bragg, Bright,\r\nClingman, Crittenden, Douglas, Fitch, Green, Gwin, Hemphill, Hunter,\r\nIverson, Johnson of Tennessee, Kennedy, Lane, Mason, Nicholson, Pearce,\r\nPolk, Powell, Pugh, Rice, Saulsbury, Sebastian, Slidell and Wigfall--29.\r\n\r\nNAYS.--Messrs.  Anthony, Bingham, Cameron, Chandler, Clark, Collamer,\r\nDixon, Doolittle, Durkee, Fessenden, Foot, Foster, Grimes, Hale, Harlan,\r\nKing, Latham, Seward, Simmons, Sumner, Ten Eyck, Trumbull, Wade and\r\nWilson--24.\r\n\r\nThe question now recurred upon an amendment, in the nature of a\r\nsubstitute, offered by Mr. Clark, to strike out the preamble of the\r\nCrittenden proposition and all of the resolutions after the word\r\n\"resolved,\" and insert:\r\n\r\n\"That the provisions of the Constitution are ample for the preservation\r\nof the Union, and the protection of all the material interests of the\r\nCountry; that it needs to be obeyed rather than amended; and that an\r\nextrication from our present dangers is to be looked for in strenuous\r\nefforts to preserve the peace, protect the public property, and enforce\r\nthe laws, rather than in new Guarantees for particular interests,\r\nCompromises for particular difficulties, or Concessions to unreasonable\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That all attempts to dissolve the present Union, or overthrow\r\nor abandon the present Constitution, with the hope or expectation of\r\nconstructing a new one, are dangerous, illusory, and destructive; that\r\nin the opinion of the Senate of the United States no such Reconstruction\r\nis practicable; and, therefore, to the maintenance of the existing Union\r\nand Constitution should be directed all the energies of all the\r\ndepartments of the Government, and the efforts of all good citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore reaching a vote on this amendment, Mr. Anthony, (January 16th)\r\nmade a most conciliatory speech, pointing out such practical objections\r\nto the Crittenden proposition as occurred to his mind, and then,\r\ncontinuing, said: \"I believe, Mr. President, that if the danger which\r\nmenaces us is to be avoided at all, it must be by Legislation; which is\r\nmore ready, more certain, and more likely to be satisfactory, than\r\nConstitutional Amendment.  The main difficulty is the Territorial\r\nquestion.  The demand of the Senators on the other side of the Chamber,\r\nand of those whom they represent, is that the territory south of the\r\nline of the Missouri Compromise shall be open to their peculiar\r\nProperty.  All this territory, except the Indian Reservation, is within\r\nthe limits of New Mexico; which, for a part of its northern boundary,\r\nruns up two degrees above that line.  This is now a Slave Territory;\r\nmade so by Territorial Legislation; and Slavery exists there, recognized\r\nand protected.  Now, I am willing, as soon as Kansas can be admitted, to\r\nvote for the admission of New Mexico as a State, with such Constitution\r\nas the People may adopt.  This disposes of all the territory that is\r\nadapted to Slave Labor or that is claimed by the South.  It ought to\r\nsettle the whole question.  Surely if we can dispose of all the\r\nterritory that we have, we ought not to quarrel over that which we have\r\nnot, and which we have no very honest way of acquiring.  Let us settle\r\nthe difficulties that threaten us now, and not anticipate those which\r\nmay never come.  Let the public mind have time to cool * * *.  In\r\noffering to settle this question by the admission of New Mexico, we of\r\nthe North who assent to it propose a great Sacrifice, and offer a large\r\nConcession.\r\n\r\n\"* * *  But we make the offer in a spirit of Compromise and good\r\nfeeling, which we hope will be reciprocated.  * * *  I appeal to\r\nSenators on the other side, when we thus offer to bridge over full\r\nseven-eighths of the frightful chasm that separates us, will you not\r\nbuild the other eighth?  When, with outstretched arms, we approach you\r\nso near that, by reaching out your hands you can clasp ours in the\r\nfraternal grasp from which they should never be separated, will you,\r\nwith folded arms and closed eyes, stand upon extreme demands which you\r\nknow we cannot accept, and for which, if we did, we could not carry our\r\nconstituents?  * * * Together our Fathers achieved the Independence of\r\ntheir Country; together they laid the foundations of its greatness and\r\nits glory; together they constructed this beautiful system under which\r\nit is our privilege to live, which it is our duty to preserve and to\r\ntransmit.  Together we enjoy that privilege; together we must perform\r\nthat duty.  I will not believe that, in the madness of popular folly and\r\ndelusion, the most benignant Government that ever blessed humanity is to\r\nbe broken up.  I will not believe that this great Power which is\r\nmarching with giant steps toward the first place among the Nations of\r\nthe Earth, is to be turned 'backward on its mighty track.'  There are no\r\ngrievances, fancied or real, that cannot be redressed within the Union\r\nand under the Constitution.  There are no differences between us that\r\nmay not be settled if we will take them up in the spirit of those to\r\nwhose places we have succeeded, and the fruits of whose labors we have\r\ninherited.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to this more than fair proposition to the Southerners--to this\r\ntouching appeal in behalf of Peace--what was the response?  Not a word!\r\nIt seemed but to harden their hearts.\r\n\r\n     [Immediately after Mr. Anthony's appeal to the Southern Senators, a\r\n     motion was made by Mr. Collamer to postpone the Crittenden\r\n     Resolutions and take up the Kansas Admission Bill.  Here was the\r\n     chance at once offered to them to respond to that appeal--to make a\r\n     first step, as it were.  They would not make it.  The motion was\r\n     defeated by 25 yeas to 30 nays--Messrs. Benjamin and Slidell of\r\n     Louisiana, Hemphill and Wigfall of Texas, Iverson of Georgia, and\r\n     Johnson of Arkansas, voting \"nay.\"  The question at once recurred\r\n     on the amendment of Mr. Clark--being a substitute for the\r\n     Crittenden Resolutions, declaring in effect all Compromise\r\n     unnecessary.  To let that substitute be adopted, was to insure the\r\n     failure of the Crittenden proposition.  Yet these same six Southern\r\n     Senators though present, refused to vote, and permitted the\r\n     substitute to be adopted by 25 yeas to 23 nays.  The vote of Mr.\r\n     Douglas, who had been \"called out for an instant into the\r\n     ante-room, and deprived of the opportunity of voting \"--as he\r\n     afterwards stated when vainly asking unanimous consent to have his\r\n     vote recorded among the nays-would have made it 25 yeas to 24 nays,\r\n     had he been present and voting, while the votes of the six Southern\r\n     Senators aforesaid, had they voted, would have defeated the\r\n     substitute by 25 yeas to 30 nays.  Then upon a direct vote on the\r\n     Crittenden Compromise there would not only have been the 30 in its\r\n     favor, but the vote of at least one Republican (Baker) in addition,\r\n     to carry it, and, although that would not have given the necessary\r\n     two-thirds, yet it would have been a majority handsome enough to\r\n     have ultimately turned the scales, in both Houses, for a peaceful\r\n     adjustment of the trouble, and have avoided all the sad\r\n     consequences which so speedily befell the Nation.  But this would\r\n     not have suited the Treasonable purposes of the Conspirators.  Ten\r\n     days before this they had probably arranged the Programme in this,\r\n     as well as other matters.  Very certain it is that no time was lost\r\n     by them and their friends in making the best use for their Cause of\r\n     this vote, in the doubtful States of Missouri and North Carolina\r\n     especially.  In the St. Louis journals a Washington dispatch,\r\n     purporting (untruly however) to come from Senators Polk and Green,\r\n     was published to this effect.\r\n\r\n     \"The Crittenden Resolutions were lost by a vote of 25 to 23.  A\r\n     motion of Mr. Cameron to reconsider was lost; and thus ends all\r\n     hope of reconciliation.  Civil War is now considered inevitable,\r\n     and late accounts declare that Fort Sumter will be attacked without\r\n     delay.  The Missouri delegation recommend immediate Secession.\"\r\n\r\n     This is but a sample of other similar dispatches sent elsewhere.\r\n     And the following dispatch, signed by Mr. Crittenden, and published\r\n     in the Raleigh, N.  C., Register, to quiet the excitement raised by\r\n     the telegrams of the Conspirators, serves also to indicate that the\r\n     friends of Compromise were not disheartened by their defeat:\r\n\r\n                    \"WASHINGTON, Jan.  17th, 9 P. M.\r\n\r\n     \"In reply the vote against my resolutions will be reconsidered.\r\n     Their failure was the result of the refusal of six Southern\r\n     Senators to vote.  There is yet good hope of success.\r\n\r\n                    \"JOHN J. CRITTENDEN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     There is instruction also to be drawn from the speeches of Senators\r\n     Saulsbury, and Johnson of Tennessee, made fully a year afterward\r\n     (Jan. 29-31, 1862) in the Senate, touching the defeat of the\r\n     Crittenden Compromise by the Clark substitute at this time.\r\n     Speaking of the second session of the Thirty-sixth Congress, Mr.\r\n     Saulsbury said:\r\n\r\n     \"At that session, while vainly striving with others for the\r\n     adoption of those measures, I remarked in my place in the Senate\r\n     that--\r\n\r\n     \"'If any Gibbon should hereafter write the Decline and Fall of the\r\n     American Republic, he would date its fall from the rejection by the\r\n     Senate of the propositions submitted by the Senator from Kentucky.'\r\n\r\n     \"I believed so then, and I believe so now.  I never shall forget,\r\n     Mr. President, how my heart bounded for joy when I thought I saw a\r\n     ray of hope for their adoption in the fact that a Republican\r\n     Senator now on this floor came to me and requested that I should\r\n     inquire of Mr. Toombs, who was on the eve of his departure for\r\n     Georgia to take a seat in the Convention of that State which was to\r\n     determine the momentous question whether she should continue a\r\n     member of the Union or withdraw from it, whether, if the Crittenden\r\n     propositions were adopted, Georgia would remain in the Union.\r\n\r\n     \"Said Mr. Toombs:\r\n\r\n     \"'Tell him frankly for me that if those resolutions are adopted by\r\n     the vote of any respectable number of Republican Senators,\r\n     evidencing their good faith to advocate their ratification by their\r\n     people, Georgia will not Secede.  This is the position I assumed\r\n     before the people of Georgia.  I told them that if the party in\r\n     power gave evidence of an intention to preserve our rights in the\r\n     Union, we were bound to wait until their people could act.'\r\n\r\n     \"I communicated the answer.  The Substitute of the Senator from New\r\n     Hampshire [Mr. Clark] was subsequently adopted, and from that day\r\n     to this the darkness and the tempest and the storm have thickened,\r\n     until thousands like myself, as good and as true Union men as you,\r\n     Sir, though you may question our motives, have not only despaired\r\n     but are without hope in the future.\"\r\n\r\n     To this speech, Mr. Johnson of Tennessee subsequently replied as\r\n     follows in the United States Senate (Jan.  31, 1862)\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, it has been said by the distinguished Senator from Delaware\r\n     [Mr. Saulsbury] that the questions of controversy might all have\r\n     been settled by Compromise.  He dealt rather extensively in the\r\n     Party aspect of the case, and seemingly desired to throw the onus\r\n     of the present condition of affairs entirely on one side.  He told\r\n     us that, if so and so had been done, these questions could have\r\n     been settled, and that now there would have been no War.  He\r\n     referred particularly to the resolution offered during the last\r\n     Congress by the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Clark], and upon\r\n     the vote on that he based his argument.  * * *  The Senator told us\r\n     that the adoption of the Clark amendment to the Crittenden\r\n     Resolutions defeated the settlement of the questions of\r\n     controversy; and that, but for that vote, all could have been peace\r\n     and prosperity now.  We were told that the Clark amendment defeated\r\n     the Crittenden Compromise, and prevented a settlement of the\r\n     controversy.  On this point I will read a portion of the speech of\r\n     my worthy and talented friend from California [Mr. Latham]; and\r\n     when I speak of him thus, I do it in no unmeaning sense I intend\r\n     that he, not I, shall answer the Senator from Delaware.  * * *  As\r\n     I have said, the Senator from Delaware told us that the Clark\r\n     amendment was the turning point in the whole matter; that from it\r\n     had flowed Rebellion, Revolution, War, the shooting and\r\n     imprisonment of people in different States--perhaps he meant to\r\n     include my own.  This was the Pandora's box that has been opened,\r\n     out of which all the evils that now afflict the Land have flown.  *\r\n     * *  My worthy friend from California [Mr. Latham], during the last\r\n     session of Congress, made one of the best speeches he ever made.  *\r\n     * * In the course of that speech, upon this very point he made use\r\n     of these remarks:\r\n\r\n     \"'Mr. President, being last winter a careful eye-witness of all\r\n     that occurred, I soon became satisfied that it was a deliberate,\r\n     wilful design, on the part of some representatives of Southern\r\n     States, to seize upon the election of Mr. Lincoln merely as an\r\n     excuse to precipitate this revolution upon the Country.  One\r\n     evidence, to my mind, is the fact that South Carolina never sent\r\n     her Senators here.'\r\n\r\n     \"Then they certainly were not influenced by the Clark amendment.\r\n\r\n     \"'An additional evidence is, that when gentlemen on this floor, by\r\n     their votes, could have controlled legislation, they refused to\r\n     cast them for fear that the very Propositions submitted to this\r\n     body might have an influence in changing the opinions of their\r\n     constituencies.  Why, Sir, when the resolutions submitted by the\r\n     Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Clark], were offered as an\r\n     amendment to the Crittenden Propositions, for the manifest purpose\r\n     of embarrassing the latter, and the vote taken on the 16th of\r\n     January, 1861, I ask, what did we see?  There were fifty-five\r\n     Senators at that time upon this floor, in person.  The Globe of the\r\n     second Session, Thirty-Sixth Congress, Part I., page 409, shows\r\n     that upon the call of the yeas and nays immediately preceding the\r\n     vote on the substituting of Mr. Clark's amendment, there were\r\n     fifty-five votes cast.  I will read the vote from the Globe:\r\n\r\n     \"'YEAS--Messrs.

Why not save this\r\n     Proposition, and see if we cannot bring the Country to it?'  He\r\n     gave me rather an abrupt answer, and said he would control his own\r\n     action without consulting me or anybody else.  Said I: 'Vote, and\r\n     show yourself an honest man.'  As soon as the vote was taken, he\r\n     and others telegraphed South, 'We cannot get any Compromise.'  Here\r\n     were six Southern men refusing to vote, when the amendment would\r\n     have been rejected by four majority if they had voted.  Who, then,\r\n     has brought these evils on the Country?  Was it Mr. Clark?  He was\r\n     acting out his own policy; but with the help we had from the other\r\n     side of the chamber, if all those on this side had been true to the\r\n     Constitution and faithful to their constituents, and had acted with\r\n     fidelity to the Country, the amendment of the Senator from New\r\n     Hampshire could have been voted down, the defeat of which the\r\n     Senator from Delaware says would have saved the Country.  Whose\r\n     fault was it?  Who is responsible for it?  * * *  Who did it?\r\n     SOUTHERN TRAITORS, as was said in the speech of the Senator from\r\n     California.  They did it.  They wanted no Compromise.  They\r\n     accomplished their object by withholding their votes; and hence the\r\n     Country has been involved in the present difficulty.  Let me read\r\n     another extract from this speech of the Senator from California\r\n\r\n     \"'I recollect full well the joy that pervaded the faces of some of\r\n     those gentlemen at the result, and the sorrow manifested by the\r\n     venerable Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Crittenden].  The record shows\r\n     that Mr. Pugh, from Ohio, despairing of any Compromise between the\r\n     extremes of ultra Republicanism and Disunionists, working\r\n     manifestly for the same end, moved, immediately after the vote was\r\n     announced, to lay the whole subject on the table.  If you will turn\r\n     to page 443, same volume, you will find, when, at a late period,\r\n     Mr. Cameron, from Pennsylvania, moved to reconsider the vote,\r\n     appeals having been made to sustain those who were struggling to\r\n     preserve the Peace of the Country, that the vote was reconsidered;\r\n     and when, at last, the Crittenden Propositions were submitted on\r\n     the 2d day of March, these Southern States having 'nearly all\r\n     Seceded, they were then lost but by one vote.

The Crittenden Proposition\r\n     would have been indorsed by a majority vote, the subject finally\r\n     going before the People, who have never yet, after consideration,\r\n     refused Justice, for any length of time, to any portion of the\r\n     Country.\r\n\r\n     \"'I believe more, Mr. President, that these gentlemen were acting\r\n     in pursuance of a settled and fixed plan to break up and destroy\r\n     this Government.'\r\n\r\n     \"When we had it in our power to vote down the amendment of the\r\n     Senator from New Hampshire, and adopt the Crittenden Resolutions,\r\n     certain Southern Senators prevented it; and yet, even at a late day\r\n     of the session, after they had Seceded, the Crittenden Proposition\r\n     was only lost by one vote.  If Rebellion and bloodshed and murder\r\n     have followed, to whose skirts does the responsibility attach?\r\n\r\n     \"What else was done at the very same session?  The House of\r\n     Representatives passed, and sent to this body, a Proposition to\r\n     amend the Constitution of the United States, so as to prohibit\r\n     Congress from ever hereafter interfering with the Institution of\r\n     Slavery in the States, making that restriction a part of the\r\n     Organic law of the Land.  That Constitutional Amendment came here\r\n     after the Senators from seven States had Seceded; and yet it was\r\n     passed by a two-third vote in the Senate.  Have you ever heard of\r\n     any one of the States which had then Seceded, or which has since\r\n     Seceded, taking up that Amendment to the Constitution, and saying\r\n     they would ratify it, and make it a part of that instrument?  No.\r\n     Does not the whole history of this Rebellion tell you that it was\r\n     Revolution that the Leaders wanted, that they started for, that\r\n     they intended to have?  The facts to which I have referred show how\r\n     the Crittenden Proposition might have been carried; and when the\r\n     Senators from the Slave States were reduced to one-fourth of the\r\n     members of this body, the two Houses passed a Proposition to Amend\r\n     the Constitution, so as to guarantee to the States perfect security\r\n     in regard to the Institution of Slavery in all future time, and\r\n     prohibiting Congress from legislating on the subject.\r\n\r\n     \"But what more was done?  After Southern Senators had treacherously\r\n     abandoned the Constitution and deserted their posts here, Congress\r\n     passed Bills for the Organization of three new Territories: Dakota,\r\n     Nevada, and Colorado; and in the sixth section of each of those\r\n     Bills, after conferring, affirmatively, power on the Territorial\r\n     Legislature, it went on to exclude certain powers by using a\r\n     negative form of expression; and it provided, among other things,\r\n     that the Legislature should have no power to legislate so as to\r\n     impair the right to private property; that it should lay no tax\r\n     discriminating against one description of Property in favor of\r\n     another; leaving the power on all these questions, not in the\r\n     Territorial Legislature, but in the People when they should come to\r\n     form a State Constitution.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, I ask, taking the Amendment to the Constitution, and taking\r\n     the three Territorial Bills, embracing every square inch of\r\n     territory in the possession of the United States, how much of the\r\n     Slavery question was left?  What better Compromise could have been\r\n     made?  Still we are told that matters might have been Compromised,\r\n     and that if we had agreed to Compromise, bloody Rebellion would not\r\n     now be abroad in the Land.  Sir, Southern Senators are responsible\r\n     for it.  They stood here with power to accomplish the result, and\r\n     yet treacherously, and, I may say, tauntingly they left this\r\n     chamber, and announced that they had dissolved their connection\r\n     with the Government.  Then, when we were left in the hands of those\r\n     whom we had been taught to believe would encroach upon our Rights,\r\n     they gave us, in the Constitutional Amendment and in the three\r\n     Territorial Bills, all that had ever been asked; and yet gentlemen\r\n     talked Compromise!\r\n\r\n     \"Why was not this taken and accepted?  No; it was not Compromise\r\n     that the Leaders wanted; they wanted Power; they wanted to Destroy\r\n     this Government, so that they might have place and emolument for\r\n     themselves.  They had lost confidence in the intelligence and\r\n     virtue and integrity of the People, and their capacity to govern\r\n     themselves; and they intended to separate and form a government,\r\n     the chief corner-stone of which should be Slavery, disfranchising\r\n     the great mass of the People, of which we have seen constant\r\n     evidence, and merging the Powers of Government in the hands of the\r\n     Few.  I know what I say.  I know their feelings and their\r\n     sentiments.  I served in the Senate here with them.  I know they\r\n     were a Close Corporation, that had no more confidence in or respect\r\n     for the People than has the Dey of Algiers.  I fought that Close\r\n     Corporation here.  I knew that they were no friends of the People.\r\n     I knew that Slidell and Mason and Benjamin and Iverson and Toombs\r\n     were the enemies of Free Government, and I know so now.  I\r\n     commenced the war upon them before a State Seceded; and I intend to\r\n     keep on fighting this great battle before the Country, for the\r\n     perpetuity of Free Government.  They seek to overthrow it, and to\r\n     establish a Despotism in its place.  That is the great battle which\r\n     is upon our hands.  * * *  Now, the Senator from Delaware tells us\r\n     that if that (Crittenden) Compromise had been made, all these\r\n     consequences would have been avoided.  It is a mere pretense; it is\r\n     false.  Their object was to overturn the Government.  If they could\r\n     not get the Control of this Government, they were willing to divide\r\n     the Country and govern part of it.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clark substitute was then agreed to, by 25 (Republican) yeas to 23\r\nDemocratic and Conservative (Bell-Everett) nays--6 Pro-Slavery Senators\r\nnot voting, although present; and then, without division, the Crittenden\r\nResolutions were tabled--Mr. Cameron, however, entering a motion to\r\nreconsider.  Subsequently the action of the Senate, both on the\r\nResolutions and Substitute, was reconsidered, and March 2d the matter\r\ncame up again, as will hereafter appear.\r\n\r\nTwo days prior to this action in the Senate, Mr. Corwin, Chairman of the\r\nSelect Committee of Thirty-three, reported to the House (January 14th),\r\nfrom a majority of that Committee, the following Joint Resolution:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, That all attempts on the parts\r\nof the Legislatures of any of the States to obstruct or hinder the\r\nrecovery and surrender of Fugitives from Service or Labor, are in\r\nderogation of the Constitution of the United States, inconsistent with\r\nthe comity and good neighborhood that should prevail among the several\r\nStates, and dangerous to the Peace of the Union.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the several States be respectfully requested to cause\r\ntheir Statutes to be revised, with a view to ascertain if any of them\r\nare in conflict with or tend to embarrass or hinder the execution of the\r\nLaws of the United States, made in pursuance of the second section of\r\nthe Fourth Article of the Constitution of the United States for the\r\ndelivery up of Persons held to Labor by the laws of any State and\r\nescaping therefrom; and the Senate and House of Representatives\r\nearnestly request that all enactments having such tendency be forthwith\r\nrepealed, as required by a just sense of Constitutional obligations, and\r\nby a due regard for the Peace of the Republic; and the President of the\r\nUnited States is requested to communicate these resolutions to the\r\nGovernors of the several States, with a request that they will lay the\r\nsame before the Legislatures thereof respectively.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we recognize Slavery as now existing in fifteen of the\r\nUnited States by the usages and laws of those States; and we recognize\r\nno authority, legally or otherwise, outside of a State where it so\r\nexists, to interfere with Slaves or Slavery in such States, in disregard\r\nof the Rights of their owners or the Peace of society.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we recognize the justice and propriety of a faithful\r\nexecution of the Constitution, and laws made in pursuance thereof, on\r\nthe subject of Fugitive Slaves, or Fugitives from Service or Labor, and\r\ndiscountenance all mobs or hindrances to the execution of such laws, and\r\nthat citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens in the several States.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That we recognize no such conflicting elements in its\r\ncomposition, or sufficient cause from any source, for a dissolution of\r\nthis Government; that we were not sent here to destroy, but to sustain\r\nand harmonize the Institutions of the Country, and to see that equal\r\njustice is done to all parts of the same; and finally, to perpetuate its\r\nexistence on terms of equality and justice to all the States.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That a faithful observance, on the part of all the States, of\r\nall their Constitutional obligations to each other and to the Federal\r\nGovernment, is essential to the Peace of the Country.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That it is the duty of the Federal Government to enforce the\r\nFederal Laws, protect the Federal property, and preserve the Union of\r\nthese States.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That each State be requested to revise its Statutes, and, if\r\nnecessary, so to amend the same as to secure, without Legislation by\r\nCongress, to citizens of other States traveling therein, the same\r\nprotection as citizens of such States enjoy; and also to protect the\r\ncitizens of other States traveling or sojourning therein against popular\r\nviolence or illegal summary punishment, without trial in due form of\r\nlaw, for imputed crimes.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That each State be also respectfully requested to enact such\r\nlaws as will prevent and punish any attempt whatever in such State to\r\nrecognize or set on foot the lawless invasion of any other State or\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the President be requested to transmit copies of the\r\nforegoing resolutions to the Governors of the several States, with a\r\nrequest that they be communicated to their respective Legislatures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Joint Resolution, with amendments proposed to the same, came up in\r\nthe House for action, on the 27th of February, 1861--the same day upon\r\nwhich the Peace Congress or Conference concluded its labors at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe Proposition of Mr. Burch, of California, was the first acted upon.\r\nIt was to amend the Select Committee's resolutions, as above given, by\r\nadding to them another resolution at the end thereof, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, etc., That it be, and is hereby, recommended to the several\r\nStates of the Union that they, through their respective Legislatures,\r\nrequest the Congress of the United States to call a Convention of all\r\nthe States, in accordance with Article Fifth of the Constitution, for\r\nthe purpose of amending said Constitution in such manner and with regard\r\nto such subjects as will more adequately respond to the wants, and\r\nafford more sufficient Guarantees to the diversified and growing\r\nInterests of the Government and of the People composing the same.\"\r\n\r\nThis (Burch) amendment, however, was defeated by 14 yeas to 109 nays.\r\n\r\nA Proposition of Mr. Kellogg, of Illinois, came up next for action.  It\r\nwas a motion to strike out all after the first word \"That\" in the\r\nCrittenden Proposition--which had been offered by Mr. Clemens as a\r\nsubstitute for the Committee Resolutions--and insert the following:\r\n\r\n\"The following articles be, and are hereby, proposed and submitted as\r\nAmendments to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be\r\nvalid, to all intents and purposes as part of said Constitution, when\r\nratified by Conventions of three-fourths of the several States.\r\n\r\n\"Article XIII.  That in all the territory now held by the United States\r\nsituate north of latitude 36  30' Involuntary Servitude, except in the\r\npunishment for crime, is prohibited while such territory shall remain\r\nunder a Territorial government; that in all the territory now held south\r\nof said line, neither Congress nor any Territorial Legislature shall\r\nhinder or prevent the emigration to said territory of Persons; held to\r\nService from any State of this Union, when that relation exists by\r\nvirtue of any law or usage of such State, while it shall remain in a\r\nTerritorial condition; and when any Territory north or south of said\r\nline, within such boundaries as Congress may prescribe, shall contain\r\nthe population requisite for a member of Congress, according to the then\r\nFederal ratio of representation of the People of the United States, it\r\nmay, if its form of government be Republican, be admitted into the Union\r\non an equal footing with the original States, with or without the\r\nrelation of Persons held to Service and Labor, as the Constitution of\r\nsuch new State may provide.\r\n\r\n\"Article XIV.  That nothing in the Constitution of the United States, or\r\nany amendment thereto, shall be so construed as to authorize any\r\nDepartment of the Government to in any manner interfere with the\r\nrelation of Persons held to Service in any State where that relation\r\nexists, nor in any manner to establish or sustain that relation in any\r\nState where it is prohibited by the Laws or Constitution of such State.\r\nAnd that this Article shall not be altered or amended without the\r\nconsent of every State in the Union.\r\n\r\n\"Article XV.  The third paragraph of the second section of the Fourth\r\nArticle of the Constitution shall be taken and construed to authorize\r\nand empower Congress to pass laws necessary to secure the return of\r\nPersons held to Service or Labor under the laws of any State, who may\r\nhave escaped therefrom, to the party to whom such Service or Labor may\r\nbe due.\r\n\r\n\"Article XVI.  The migration or importation of Persons held to Service\r\nor Involuntary Servitude, into any State, Territory, or place within the\r\nUnited States, from any place or country beyond the limits of the United\r\nStates or Territories thereof, is forever prohibited.\r\n\r\n\"Article XVII.  No territory beyond the present limits of the United\r\nStates and the Territories thereof, shall be annexed to or be acquired\r\nby the United States, unless by treaty, which treaty shall be ratified\r\nby a vote of two-thirds of the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kellogg Proposition was defeated by 33 yeas to 158\r\nnays.\r\n\r\nThe Clemens Substitute was next voted on.  This embraced the whole of\r\nthe Crittenden Compromise Proposition, as amended in the Senate by\r\ninserting the provision as to all territory \"hereafter acquired,\" with\r\nthe addition of another proposed Article of Amendment to the\r\nConstitution, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Article VII.  Section I.  The elective franchise and the Right to hold\r\noffice, whether Federal, State, Territorial, or Municipal, shall not be\r\nexercised by Persons who are, in whole or in part, of the African Race.\r\n\r\n\"Section II.  The United States shall have power to acquire from time to\r\ntime districts of country in Africa and South America, for the\r\ncolonization, at expense of the Federal Treasury, of such Free Negroes\r\nand Mulattoes as the several States may wish to have removed from their\r\nlimits, and from the District of Columbia, and such other places as may\r\nbe under the jurisdiction of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThe Clemens Substitute (or Crittenden Measure, with the addition of said\r\nproposed Article VII.), was defeated by 80 yeas to 113 nays, and then\r\nthe Joint Resolution of the Select Committee as heretofore given--after\r\na vain attempt to table it--was passed by 136 yeas to 53 nays.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this action, a Joint Resolution to amend the\r\nConstitution of the United States, which had also been previously\r\nreported by the Select Committee of Thirty-three, came before the House,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"Be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, (two-thirds of both Houses\r\nconcurring), That the following Article be proposed to the Legislatures\r\nof the several States as an Amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, which, when ratified by three-fourths of said Legislatures,\r\nshall be valid, to all intents and purposes, as a part of the said\r\nConstitution, namely:\r\n\r\n\"Article XII.  No amendment of this Constitution having for its object\r\nany interference within the States with the relation between their\r\ncitizens and those described in Section II. of the First Article of the\r\nConstitution as 'all other persons,' shall originate with any State that\r\ndoes not recognize that relation within its own limits, or shall be\r\nvalid without the assent of every one of the States composing the\r\nUnion.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Corwin submitted an Amendment striking out all the words after\r\n\"namely;\" and inserting the following:\r\n\r\n\"Article XII.  No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will\r\nauthorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within\r\nany State, with the Domestic Institutions thereof, including that of\r\nPersons held to Labor or Service by the laws of said State.\"\r\n\r\nAmid scenes of great disorder, the Corwin Amendment was adopted by 120\r\nyeas to 61 nays, and then the Joint Resolution as amended, was defeated\r\n(two-thirds not voting in the affirmative) by 123 yeas to 71 nays.  On\r\nthe following day (February 28th), amid still greater confusion and\r\ndisorder, which the Speaker, despite frequent efforts, was unable to\r\nquell, that vote was reconsidered, and the Joint Resolution passed by\r\n133 yeas to 65 nays--a result which, when announced was received with\r\n\"loud and prolonged applause, both on the floor, and in the galleries.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of March, the House Joint Resolution just given, proposing an\r\nAmendment to the Constitution, prohibiting Congress from touching\r\nSlavery within any State where it exists, came up in the Senate for\r\naction.\r\n\r\nMr. Pugh moved to substitute for it the Crittenden Proposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle moved to amend the proposed substitute (the Crittenden\r\nProposition), by the insertion of the following, as an additional\r\nArticle:\r\n\r\n\"Under this Constitution, as originally adopted, and as it now exists,\r\nno State has power to withdraw from the jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates; but this Constitution, and all laws passed in pursuance of its\r\ndelegated powers, are the Supreme Law of the Land, anything contained in\r\nany Constitution, Ordinance, or Act of any State, to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Doolittle's amendment was lost by 18 yeas to 28 nays.\r\n\r\nMr. Pugh's substitute (the Crittenden Proposition), was lost by 14 yeas\r\nto 25 nays.\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham moved to amend the House Joint Resolution, by striking out\r\nall after the word \"resolved,\" and inserting the words of the Clark\r\nProposition as heretofore given, but the amendment was rejected by 13\r\nyeas to 25 nays.\r\n\r\nMr. Grimes moved to strike out all after the word \"whereas\" in the\r\npreamble of the House Joint Resolution, and insert the following:\r\n\r\n\"The Legislatures of the States of Kentucky, New Jersey, and Illinois\r\nhave applied to Congress to call a Convention for proposing Amendments\r\nto the Constitution of the United States: Therefore,\r\n\r\n\"Be it Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, That the Legislatures of the\r\nother States be invited to take the subject of such a Convention into\r\nconsideration, and to express their will on that subject to Congress, in\r\npursuance of the Fifth Article of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment was also rejected, by 14 yeas to 25 nays.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson, of Arkansas, offered, as an amendment to the House Joint\r\nResolution, the propositions submitted by the Peace Congress or\r\nConference, but the amendment was disagreed to by 3 yeas to 34 nays.\r\n\r\nThe House Joint Resolution was then adopted by 24 yeas to 12 nays.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the Crittenden Proposition came up again as a separate\r\norder, with the Clark substitute to it (once carried, but reconsidered),\r\npending.  The Clark substitute was then rejected by 14 yeas to 22 nays.\r\n\r\nMr. Crittenden then offered the Propositions of the Peace\r\nCongress, as a substitute for his own-and they were rejected by 7 yeas\r\nto 28 nays.\r\n\r\nThe Crittenden Proposition itself was then rejected, by\r\n19 yeas to 20 nays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                 SLAVERY'S SETTING, AND FREEDOM'S DAWN.\r\n\r\nOn that long last night of the 36th Congress--and of the Democratic\r\nAdministration--to the proceedings of which reference was made in the\r\npreceding Chapter, several notable speeches were made, but there was\r\nsubstantially nothing done, in the line of Compromise.  The only thing\r\nthat had been accomplished was the passage, as we have seen, by\r\ntwo-thirds majority in both Houses, of the Joint Resolution proposing a\r\nConstitutional Amendment prohibiting Congress from meddling with Slavery\r\nin Slave States.  There was no Concession nor Compromise in this,\r\nbecause Republicans, as well as Democrats, had always held that Congress\r\nhad no such power.  It is true that the Pro-slavery men had charged the\r\nRepublicans with ultimate designs, through Congress, upon Slavery in the\r\nSlave States; and Mr. Crittenden pleaded for its passage as exhibiting a\r\nspirit, on their part, of reconciliation; that was all.\r\n\r\nIn his speech that night--that memorable and anxious night preceding the\r\nInauguration of President Lincoln--the venerable Mr. Crittenden,\r\nspeaking before the Resolution was agreed to, well sketched the\r\nsituation when he said in the Senate: \"It is an admitted fact that our\r\nUnion, to some extent, has already been dismembered; and that further\r\ndismemberment is impending and threatened.  It is a fact that the\r\nCountry is in danger.  This is admitted on all hands.  It is our duty,\r\nif we can, to provide a remedy for this.  We are, under the Constitution\r\nand by the election of the People, the great guardians, as well as the\r\nadministrators of this Government.  To our wisdom they have trusted this\r\ngreat chart.  Remedies have been proposed; resolutions have been\r\noffered, proposing for adoption measures which it was thought would\r\nsatisfy the Country, and preserve as much of the Union as remained to us\r\nat least, if they were not enough at once to recall the Seceding States\r\nto the Union.  We have passed none of these measures.  The differences\r\nof opinion among Senators have been such that we have not been able to\r\nconcur in any of the measures which have been proposed, even by bare\r\nmajorities, much less by that two-thirds majority which is necessary to\r\ncarry into effect some of the pacific measures which have been proposed.\r\nWe are about to adjourn.  We have done nothing.  Even the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, beholding this great ruin around them, beholding\r\nDismemberment and Revolution going on, and Civil War threatened as the\r\nresult, have been able to do nothing; we have absolutely done nothing.\r\nSir, is not this a remarkable spectacle?  * * * How does it happen that\r\nnot even a bare majority here, when the Country trusted to our hands is\r\ngoing to ruin, have been competent to devise any measure of public\r\nsafety?  How does it happen that we have not had unanimity enough to\r\nagree on any measure of that kind?  Can we account for it to ourselves,\r\ngentlemen?  We see the danger; we acknowledge our duty, and yet, with\r\nall this before us, we are acknowledging before the world that we can do\r\nnothing; acknowledging before the world, or appearing to all the world,\r\nas men who do nothing!  Sir, this will make a strange record in the\r\nhistory of Governments and in the history of the world.  Some are for\r\nCoercion; yet no army has been raised, no navy has been equipped.  Some\r\nare for pacification; yet they have been able to do nothing; the dissent\r\nof their colleagues prevents them; and here we are in the midst of a\r\nfalling Country, in the midst of a falling State, presenting to the eyes\r\nof the World the saddest spectacle it has ever seen.  Cato is\r\nrepresented by Addison as a worthy spectacle, 'a great man falling with\r\na falling State,' but he fell struggling.  We fall with the ignominy on\r\nour heads of doing nothing, like the man who stands by and sees his\r\nhouse in flames, and says to himself, 'perhaps the fire will stop before\r\nit consumes all.'\"\r\n\r\nOne of the strong pleas made in the Senate that night, was by Mr.\r\nDouglas, when he said: \"The great issue with the South has been that\r\nthey would not submit to the Wilmot proviso.  The Republican Party\r\naffirmed the doctrine that Congress must and could prohibit Slavery in\r\nthe Territories.  The issue for ten years was between Non-intervention\r\non the part of Congress, and prohibition by Congress.  Up to two years\r\nago, neither the Senator (Mason) from Virginia, nor any other Southern\r\nSenator, desired affirmative legislation to protect Slavery.  Even up to\r\nthis day, not one of them has proposed affirmative legislation to\r\nprotect it.  Whenever the question has come up, they have decided that\r\naffirmative legislation to protect it was unnecessary; and hence, all\r\nthat the South required on the Territorial question was 'hands off;\r\nSlavery shall not be prohibited by Act of Congress.' Now, what do we\r\nfind?  This very session, in view of the perils which surround the\r\nCountry, the Republican Party, in both Houses of Congress, by a\r\nunanimous vote, have backed down from their platform and abandoned the\r\ndoctrine of Congressional prohibition.  This very week three Territorial\r\nBills have been passed through both Houses of Congress without the\r\nWilmot proviso, and no man proposed to enact it; not even one man on the\r\nother side of the Chamber would rise and propose the Wilmot proviso.\"\r\n\r\n\"In organizing three Territories,\" continued he, \"two of them South of\r\nthe very line where they imposed the Wilmot proviso twelve years ago, no\r\none on the other side of the Chamber proposed it.  They have abandoned\r\nthe doctrine of the President-elect upon that point.  He said, and it is\r\non record, that he had voted for the Wilmot proviso forty-two times, and\r\nwould do it forty-two times more if he ever had a chance.  Not one of\r\nhis followers this year voted for it once.  The Senator from New York\r\n(Mr. Seward) the embodiment of the Party, sat quietly and did not\r\npropose it.  What more?  Last year we were told that the Slave Code of\r\nNew Mexico was to be repealed.  I denounced the attempted interference.\r\nThe House of Representatives passed the Bill, but the Bill remains on\r\nyour table; no one Republican member has proposed to take it up and pass\r\nit.  Practically, therefore, the Chicago platform is abandoned; the\r\nPhiladelphia platform is abandoned; the whole doctrine for which the\r\nRepublican Party contended, as to the Territories, is abandoned,\r\nsurrendered, given up.  Non-intervention is substituted in its place.\r\nThen, when we find that, on the Territorial question, the Republican\r\nParty, by a unanimous vote, have surrendered to the South all they ask,\r\nthe Territorial question ought to be considered pretty well settled.\r\nThe only question left was that of the States; and after having\r\nabandoned their aggressive policy as to the Territories, a portion of\r\nthem are willing to unite with us, and deprive themselves of the power\r\nto do it in the States.\"\r\n\r\n\"I submit,\" said he, \"that these two great facts--these startling,\r\ntremendous facts--that they have abandoned their aggressive policy in\r\nthe Territories, and are willing to give guarantees in the States, ought\r\nto be accepted as an evidence of a salutary change in Public Opinion at\r\nthe North.  All I would ask now of the Republican Party is, that they\r\nwould insert in the Constitution the same principle that they have\r\ncarried out practically in the Territorial Bills for Colorado, Dakota,\r\nand Nevada, by depriving Congress of the power hereafter to do what\r\nthere cannot be a man of them found willing to do this year; but we\r\ncannot ask them to back down too much.  I think they have done quite as\r\nmuch within one year, within three months after they have elected a\r\nPresident, as could be expected.\"\r\n\r\nThat Douglas and his followers were also patriotically willing to\r\nsacrifice a favorite theory in the face of a National peril, was brought\r\nout, at the same time, by Mr. Baker, when he said to Mr. Douglas: \"I\r\ndesire to suggest (and being a little of a Popular Sovereignty man, it\r\ncomes gracefully from me) that others of us have backed down too, from\r\nthe idea that Congress has not the power to prohibit Slavery in the\r\nTerritories; and we are proposing some of us in the Crittenden\r\nproposition, and some in the Amendment now before the Senate--to\r\nprohibit Slavery by the Constitution itself, in the Territories;\"--and\r\nby Mr. Douglas, when he replied: \"I think as circumstances change, the\r\naction of public men ought to change in a corresponding degree.  * * * I\r\nam willing to depart from my cherished theory, by an Amendment to the\r\nConstitution by which we shall settle this question on the principles\r\nprescribed in the Resolutions of the Senator from Kentucky.\"\r\n\r\n     In the House, Mr. Logan, had, on the 5th of February, 1861, said:\r\n\r\n     \"Men, Sir, North and South, who love themselves far better than\r\n     their Country, have brought us to this unhappy condition.  * * *\r\n     Let me say to gentlemen, that I will go as far as any man in the\r\n     performance of a Constitutional duty to put down Rebellion, to\r\n     suppress Insurrection, and to enforce the laws; but when we\r\n     undertake the performance of these duties, let us act in such a\r\n     manner as will be best calculated to preserve and not destroy the\r\n     Government, and keep ourselves within the bounds of the\r\n     Constitution.  * * *  Sir, I have always denied, and do yet deny,\r\n     the Right of Secession.  There is no warrant for it in the\r\n     Constitution.  It is wrong, it is unlawful, unconstitutional, and\r\n     should be called by the right name, Revolution.  No good, Sir, can\r\n     result from it, but much mischief may.  It is no remedy for any\r\n     grievance.\r\n\r\n     \"I hold that all grievances can be much easier redressed inside the\r\n     Union than out of it.  * * *  If a collision must ensue between\r\n     this Government and any of our own people, let it come when every\r\n     other means of settlement has been tried and exhausted; and not\r\n     then, except when the Government shall be compelled to repel\r\n     assaults for the protection of its property, flag, and the honor of\r\n     the Country.  * * *\r\n\r\n     \"I have been taught to believe that the preservation of this\r\n     glorious Union, with its broad flag waving over us, as the shield\r\n     for our protection on land and on sea, is paramount to all the\r\n     Parties and platforms that ever have existed, or ever can exist.  I\r\n     would, to-day, if I had the power, sink my own Party, and every\r\n     other one, with all their platforms, into the vortex of ruin,\r\n     without heaving a sigh or shedding a tear, to save the Union, or\r\n     even stop the Revolution where it is.\"\r\n\r\n     After enumerating the various propositions for adjustment, then\r\n     pending in the House, to wit: that of Senator Crittenden; that of\r\n     Senator Douglas; that of the Committee of Thirty-three; that of the\r\n     Border States; and those of Representatives McClernand, Kellogg,\r\n     and Morris, of Illinois, Mr. Logan took occasion to declare that\r\n     \"in a crisis like this\" he was \"willing to give his support to any\r\n     of them,\" but his preference was for that of Mr. Morris.\r\n\r\n     Said he: \"He (Morris) proposes that neither Congress nor a\r\n     Territorial Legislature shall interfere with Slavery in the\r\n     Territories at all; but leaves the people, when they come to form\r\n     their State Constitution, to determine the question for themselves.\r\n     I think this is the best proposition, because it is a fair\r\n     concession on all sides.  The Republicans give up their\r\n     Congressional intervention; those who are styled 'Squatter\r\n     Sovereigns' give up their Territorial legislative policy; and the\r\n     Southern (Slave) protectionists give up their protection-\r\n     intervention policy; thus every Party yields something.  With this\r\n     proposition as an Article in the Constitution, it would satisfy\r\n     every conservative man in this Union, both North and South, I do\r\n     seriously and honestly believe.\r\n\r\n     \"Having indicated my preference of these propositions, and my\r\n     reasons for that preference, I have said all I desire to say on the\r\n     point, except to repeat again, that I will willingly vote for any\r\n     of them, or make any other sacrifice necessary to save the Union.\r\n     It makes no kind of difference to me what the sacrifice; if it will\r\n     save my Country, I am ready to make it.\"  * * *\r\n\r\n     \"There are some in this Hall,\" said he, \"that are almost ready to\r\n     strike the Party fetters from their limbs, and assist in measures\r\n     of Peace.  Halt not; take the step; be independent and free at\r\n     once!  Let us overcome Party passion and error; allow virtue and\r\n     good sense in this fateful hour to be triumphant; let us invoke\r\n     Deity to interpose and prepare the way for our Country's escape\r\n     from the perils by which we are now surrounded; and in view of our\r\n     present greatness and future prospects, our magnificent and growing\r\n     cities, our many institutions of learning, our once happy and\r\n     prosperous People, our fruitful fields and golden forests, our\r\n     enjoyment of all civil and religious blessings--let Parties die\r\n     that these be preserved.  Such noble acts of patriotism and\r\n     concession, on your part, would cause posterity to render them\r\n     illustrious, and pause to contemplate the magnitude of the events\r\n     with which they were connected.  * * * In the name of the patriotic\r\n     sires who breasted the storms and vicissitudes of the Revolution;\r\n     by all the kindred ties of this Country; in the name of the many\r\n     battles fought for your Freedom; in behalf of the young and the\r\n     old; in behalf of the Arts and Sciences, Civilization, Peace,\r\n     Order, Christianity, and Humanity, I appeal to you to strike from\r\n     your limbs the chains that bind them!  Come forth from that\r\n     loathsome prison, Party Caucus; and in this hour--the most gloomy\r\n     and disheartening to the lovers of Free Institutions that has ever\r\n     existed during our Country's history--arouse the drooping spirits\r\n     of our countrymen, by putting forth your good strong arms to assist\r\n     in steadying the rocking pillars of the mightiest Republic that has\r\n     ever had an existence.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Speaker,\" continued he, \"a word or two more, and I am done.\r\n     Revolution stalks over the Land.  States have rebelled against the\r\n     constituted authorities of the Union, and now stand, sword in hand,\r\n     prepared to vindicate their new nationality.  Others are preparing\r\n     to take a similar position.  Rapidly transpiring events are\r\n     crowding on us with fearful velocity.  Soon, circumstances may\r\n     force us into an unnatural strife, in which the hand of brother\r\n     shall be uplifted against brother, and father against son.  My God,\r\n     what a spectacle!  If all the evils and calamities that have ever\r\n     happened since the World began, could be gathered in one great\r\n     Catastrophe, its horrors could not eclipse, in their frightful\r\n     proportions, the Drama that impends over us.  Whether this black\r\n     cloud that drapes in mourning the whole political heavens, shall\r\n     break forth in all the frightful intensity of War, and make\r\n     Christendom weep at the terrible atrocities that will be enacted\r\n     --or, whether it will disappear, and the sky resume its wonted\r\n     serenity, and the whole Earth be irradiated by the genial sunshine\r\n     of Peace once more--are the alternatives which this Congress, in my\r\n     judgment, has the power to select between.\"\r\n\r\nIn this same broad spirit, Mr. Seward, in his great speech of January\r\n12th, had said: \"Republicanism is subordinate to Union, as everything\r\nelse is and ought to be--Republicanism, Democracy, every other political\r\nname and thing; all are subordinate-and they ought to disappear in the\r\npresence of the great question of Union.\"  In another part of it, he had\r\neven more emphatically said: \"I therefore * * * avow my adherence to the\r\nUnion in its integrity and with all its parts, with my friends, with my\r\nParty, with my State, with my Country, or without either, as they may\r\ndetermine, in every event, whether of Peace or War, with every\r\nconsequence of honor or dishonor, of life or death.  Although I lament\r\nthe occasion, I hail with cheerfulness the duty of lifting up my voice\r\namong distracted debates, for my whole Country and its inestimable\r\nUnion.\"  And as showing still more clearly the kindly and conciliatory\r\nattitude of the great Republican leader, when speaking of those others\r\nwho seemed to be about to invoke revolutionary action to oppose--and\r\noverthrow the Government--he said: \"In such a case I can afford to meet\r\nprejudice with Conciliation, exaction with Concession which surrenders\r\nno principle, and violence with the right hand of Peace.\"\r\n\r\nIn the House of Representatives, too, the voice of patriotism was often\r\nheard through the loud clamor and disorder of that most disorderly and\r\nTreason-uttering session--was heard from the lips of statesmen, who rose\r\nhigh above Party, in their devotion to the Union.  The calm,\r\ndispassionate recital by Henry Winter Davis (of Maryland), of the\r\nsuccessive steps by which the Southern leaders had themselves created\r\nthat very \"North\" of whose antagonism they complained, was one of the\r\nbest of these, in some respects.  He was one of the great Select\r\nCommittee of Thirty-three, and it was (February 5th) after the\r\nResolutions, heretofore quoted, had been reported by it, that he\r\ncondensed the history of the situation into a nutshell, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"We are at the end of the insane revel of partisan license which, for\r\nthirty years, has, in the United States, worn the mask of Government.\r\nWe are about to close the masquerade by the dance of death.  The Nations\r\nof the World look anxiously to see if the People, ere they tread that\r\nmeasure, will come to themselves.\r\n\r\n         *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"Southern politicians have created a North.  Let us trace the process\r\nand draw the moral.\r\n\r\n\"The laws of 1850 calmed and closed the Slavery agitation; and President\r\nPierce, elected by the almost unanimous voice of the States, did not\r\nmention Slavery in his first two Messages.  In 1854, the repeal of the\r\nMissouri Compromise, at the instance of the South, reopened the\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\"Northern men, deserted by Southern Whigs, were left to unite for\r\nself-defense.\r\n\r\n\"The invasion of Kansas, in 1855 and 1856, from Missouri; the making a\r\nLegislature and laws for that Territory, by the invaders; still further\r\nunited the Northern people.  The election of 1856 measured its extent.\r\n\r\n\"The election of Mr. Buchanan and his opening policy in Kansas, soothed\r\nthe irritation, and was rapidly demoralizing the new Party, when the\r\nPro-Slavery Party in Kansas perpetrated, and the President and the South\r\naccepted, the Lecompton fraud, and again united the North more\r\nresolutely in resistance to that invasion of the rights of\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\n\"The South for the first time failed to dictate terms; and the People\r\nvindicated by their votes the refusal of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Ere this result was attained, the opinions of certain Judges of the\r\nSupreme Court scattered doubts over the law of Slavery in the\r\nTerritories; the South, while repudiating other decisions, instantly\r\nmade these opinions the criterion of faithfulness to the Constitution;\r\nwhile the North was agitated by this new sanction of the extremest\r\npretensions of their opponents.\r\n\r\n\"The South did not rest satisfied with their Judicial triumph.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately the claim was pressed for protection by Congress to\r\nSlavery, declared by the Supreme Court, they said, to exist in all the\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\n\"This completed the union of the Free States in one great defensive\r\nleague; and the result was registered in November.  That result is now\r\nitself become the starting point of new agitation--the demand of new\r\nrights and new guarantees.  The claim to access to the Territories was\r\nfollowed by the claim to Congressional protection, and that is now\r\nfollowed by the hitherto unheard of claim to a Constitutional Amendment\r\nestablishing Slavery, not merely in territory now held, but in all\r\nhereafter held from the line of 36  30' to Cape Horn, while the debate\r\nforeshadows in the distance the claim of the right of transit and the\r\nplacing of property in Slaves in all respects on the footing of other\r\nproperty--the topics of future agitation.  How long the prohibition of\r\nthe importation of Slaves will be exempted from the doctrine of\r\nequality, it needs no prophet to tell.\r\n\r\n\"In the face of this recital, let the imputation of autocratic and\r\ntyrannical aspirations cease to be cast on the people of the Free\r\nStates; let the Southern people dismiss their fears, return to their\r\nfriendly confidence in their fellow-citizens of the North, and accept,\r\nas pledges of returning Peace, the salutary amendments of the law and\r\nthe Constitution offered as the first fruits of Reconciliation.\"\r\n\r\nBut calmness, kindness, and courtesy were alike thrown away in both\r\nHouses upon the implacable Southern leaders.  As the last day of that\r\nmemorable session, which closed in the failure of all peaceful measures\r\nto restore the Union, slowly dawned--with but a few hours lacking of the\r\ntime when Mr. Lincoln would be inaugurated President of the United\r\nStates--Mr. Wigfall thought proper, in the United States Senate, to\r\nsneer at him as \"an ex-rail-splitter, an ex-grocery keeper, an\r\nex-flatboat captain, and an ex-Abolition lecturer\"--and proceeded\r\nto scold and rant at the North with furious volubility.\r\n\r\n\"Then, briefly,\" said he, \"a Party has come into power that represents\r\nthe antagonism to my own Section of the Country.  It represents two\r\nmillion men who hate us, and who, by their votes for such a man as they\r\nhave elected, have committed an overt act of hostility.  That they have\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have won the Presidency,\" said he, to the Republicans, \"and you are\r\nnow in the situation of the man who had won the elephant at a raffle.\r\nYou do not know what to do with the beast now that you have it; and\r\none-half of you to-day would give your right arms if you had been\r\ndefeated. But you succeeded, and you have to deal with facts.  Our\r\nobjection to living in this Union, and therefore the difficulty of\r\nreconstructing it, is not your Personal Liberty bills, not the\r\nTerritorial question, but that you utterly and wholly misapprehend\r\nthe Form of Government.\"\r\n\r\n\"You deny,\" continued he, \"the Sovereignty of the States; you deny the\r\nright of self-government in the People; you insist upon Negro Equality;\r\nyour people interfere impertinently with our Institutions and attempt to\r\nsubvert them; you publish newspapers; you deliver lectures; you print\r\npamphlets, and you send them among us, first, to excite our Slaves to\r\ninsurrection against their masters, and next, to array one class of\r\ncitizens against the other; and I say to you, that we cannot live in\r\npeace, either in the Union or out of it, until you have abolished your\r\nAbolition societies; not, as I have been misquoted, abolish or destroy\r\nyour school-houses; but until you have ceased in your schoolhouses\r\nteaching your children to hate us; until you have ceased to convert your\r\npulpits into hustings; until you content yourselves with preaching\r\nChrist, and Him crucified, and not delivering political harangues on the\r\nSabbath; until you have ceased inciting your own citizens to make raids\r\nand commit robberies; until you have done these things we cannot live in\r\nthe same Union with you.  Until you do these things, we cannot live out\r\nof the Union at Peace.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the words--the spiteful, bitter words--with which this chosen\r\nspokesman of the South saluted the cold and cloudy dawn of that day\r\nwhich was to see the sceptre depart from the hands of the Slave Power\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nA few hours later, under the shadow of the main Pastern Portico of the\r\nCapitol at Washington--with the retiring President and Cabinet, the\r\nSupreme Court Justices, the Foreign Diplomatic Corps, and hundreds of\r\nSenators, Representatives and other distinguished persons filling the\r\ngreat platform on either side and behind them--Abraham Lincoln stood\r\nbareheaded before full thirty thousand people, upon whose uplifted faces\r\nthe unveiled glory of the mild Spring sun now shone--stood reverently\r\nbefore that far greater and mightier Presence termed by himself, \"My\r\nrightful masters, the American People\"--and pleaded in a manly, earnest,\r\nand affectionate strain with \"such as were dissatisfied,\" to listen to\r\nthe \"better angels\" of their nature.\r\n\r\nTemperate, reasonable, kindly, persuasive--it seems strange that Mr.\r\nLincoln's Inaugural Address did not disarm at least the personal\r\nresentment of the South toward him, and sufficiently strengthen the\r\nUnion-loving people there, against the red-hot Secessionists, to put the\r\n\"brakes\" down on Rebellion.  Said he:\r\n\r\n\"Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States,\r\nthat by the accession of a Republican Administration, their Property and\r\ntheir Peace and personal security are to be endangered.  There has never\r\nbeen any reasonable cause for such apprehension.  Indeed, the most ample\r\nevidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to\r\ntheir inspection.  It is found in nearly all the published speeches of\r\nhim who now addresses you.  I do but quote from one of those speeches,\r\nwhen I declare that 'I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to\r\ninterfere with the Institution of Slavery in the States where it\r\nexists.'  I believe I have no lawful right to do so; and I have no\r\ninclination to do so.  Those who nominated and elected me, did so with\r\nthe full knowledge that I had made this, and many similar declarations,\r\nand had never recanted them.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"I now reiterate these sentiments; and in doing so, I only press upon\r\nthe public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is\r\nsusceptible, that the Property, Peace, and Security of no Section are to\r\nbe in any wise endangered by the now incoming Administration.  I add,\r\ntoo, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution\r\nand the laws, can be given, will be cheerfully given to all the States,\r\nwhen lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one Section\r\nas to another.\r\n\r\n\"I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations, and with\r\nno purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical\r\nrules.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now\r\nformidably attempted.  I hold that, in contemplation of Universal Law,\r\nand of the Constitution, the Union of these States is perpetual.\r\nPerpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all\r\nNational Governments.  It is safe to assert that no Government proper\r\never had a provision in its organic law for its own termination.\r\nContinue to execute all the express provisions of our National\r\nConstitution, and the Union will endure forever--it being impossible to\r\ndestroy it, except by some action not provided for in the instrument\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"Again, if the United States be not a Government proper, but an\r\nAssociation of States in the nature of a contract merely, can it, as a\r\ncontract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\r\nOne party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak; but does\r\nit not require all, to lawfully rescind it?\r\n\r\n\"Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that,\r\nin legal contemplation, the Union is perpetual, confirmed by the history\r\nof the Union itself.  The Union is much older than the Constitution.  It\r\nwas formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774.  It was\r\nmatured and continued in the Declaration of Independence in 1776.  It\r\nwas further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States\r\nexpressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the\r\nArticles of Confederation, in 1778; and, finally, in 1787, one of the\r\ndeclared objects, for ordaining and establishing the Constitution, was\r\n'to form a more perfect Union.'  But, if destruction of the Union by\r\none, or by a part only, of the States, be lawfully possible, the Union\r\nis less perfect than before, the Constitution having lost the vital\r\nelement of perpetuity.\r\n\r\n\"It follows, from these views, that no State, upon its own mere motion,\r\ncan lawfully get out of the Union; that Resolves and Ordinances to that\r\neffect, are legally void; and that acts of violence within any State or\r\nStates against the authority of the United States, are insurrectionary\r\nor revolutionary, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"I therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws,\r\nthe Union is unbroken, and, to the extent of my ability, I shall take\r\ncare, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the\r\nlaws of the Union shall be faithfully executed in all the States.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared\r\npurpose of the Union, that it will Constitutionally defend and maintain\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"In doing this, there need be no bloodshed or violence, and there shall\r\nbe none, unless it is forced upon the National Authority.\r\n\r\n\"The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the\r\nproperty and places belonging to the Government, and to collect the\r\nduties and imposts; but, beyond what may be necessary for these objects,\r\nthere will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the People\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n\"The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\n                   *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose\r\na new Union, as to produce harmony only, and prevent renewed Secession?\r\nPlainly, the central idea of Secession is the essence of anarchy.  A\r\nmajority, held in restraint by Constitutional checks and limitations and\r\nalways changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and\r\nsentiments, is the only true sovereign of a Free People.  Whoever\r\nrejects it, does, of necessity, fly to anarchy, or to despotism.\r\nUnanimity is impossible; the rule of a minority, as a permanent\r\narrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority\r\nprinciple, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.\r\n\r\n                    *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our\r\nrespective Sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\r\nbetween them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the\r\npresence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of\r\nour Country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain face to face; and\r\nintercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them.  Is\r\nit possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more\r\nsatisfactory after separation than before?  Can aliens make treaties,\r\neasier than friends can make laws?  Can treaties be more faithfully\r\nenforced between aliens, than laws can among friends?  Suppose you go to\r\nWar, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides,\r\nand no gain on either you cease fighting, the identical old questions,\r\nas to terms of intercourse, are again upon you.\r\n\r\n\"This Country, with its Institutions, belongs to the People who inhabit\r\nit.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can\r\nexercise their Constitutional right of amending it, or their\r\nRevolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it.  I cannot be ignorant\r\nof the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of\r\nhaving the National Constitution amended.  While I make no\r\nrecommendations of Amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority\r\nof the People over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the\r\nmodes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing\r\ncircumstances, favor, rather than oppose, a fair opportunity being\r\nafforded the People to act upon it.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"The Chief Magistrate derives all his authority from the People, and\r\nthey have conferred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the\r\nStates.  The People themselves can do this also, if they choose; but the\r\nExecutive, as such, has nothing to do with it.  His duty is to\r\nadminister the present Government, as it came to his hands, and to\r\ntransmit it, unimpaired by him, to his successor.\r\n\r\n                  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\" * * * While the People retain their virtue and vigilance, no\r\nAdministration, by any extreme of weakness or folly, can very seriously\r\ninjure the Government in the short space of four years.\r\n\r\n\"My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole\r\nsubject.  Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.  If there be an\r\nobject to hurry any of you, in hot haste, to a step which you would\r\nnever take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time;\r\nbut no good object can be frustrated by it.  Such of you as are now\r\ndissatisfied, still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the\r\nsensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new\r\nAdministration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change\r\neither.  If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied, hold the\r\nright side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for\r\nprecipitate action.  Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm\r\nreliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored Land, are still\r\ncompetent to adjust, in the best way, all our present difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is\r\nthe momentous issue of Civil War.  The Government will not assault you.\r\nYou can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.  You\r\nhave no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the Government, while I\r\nshall have the most solemn one to 'preserve, protect, and defend it'.\r\n\r\n\"I am loath to close.  We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not be\r\nenemies.  Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds\r\nof affection.  The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every\r\nbattle-field and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone,\r\nall over this broad Land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when\r\nagain touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our\r\nnature.\"\r\n\r\nStrange, indeed, must have been the thoughts that crowded through the\r\nbrain and oppressed the heart of Abraham Lincoln that night--his first\r\nat the White House!\r\n\r\nThe city of Washington swarmed with Rebels and Rebel sympathizers, and\r\nall the departments of Government were honey-combed with Treason and\r\nshadowed with treachery and espionage.  Every step proposed or\r\ncontemplated by the Government would be known to the so-called\r\nGovernment of the Confederate States almost as soon as thought of.  All\r\nmeans, to thwart and delay the carrying out of the Government's\r\npurposes, that the excuses of routine and red-tape admitted of, would be\r\nused by the Traitors within the camp, to aid the Traitors without.\r\n\r\nNo one knew all this, better than Mr. Lincoln.  With no Army, no Navy,\r\nnot even a Revenue cutter left--with forts and arsenals, ammunition and\r\narms in possession of the Rebels, with no money in the National\r\nTreasury, and the National credit blasted--the position must, even to\r\nhis hopeful nature, have seemed at this time desperate.  To be sure,\r\ndespite threats, neither few nor secret, which had been made, that he\r\nshould not live to be inaugurated, he had passed the first critical\r\npoint--had taken the inaugural oath--and was now duly installed in the\r\nWhite House.  That was something, of course, to be profoundly thankful\r\nfor.  But the matter regarded by him of larger moment--the safety of the\r\nUnion--how about that?\r\n\r\nHow that great, and just, and kindly brain, in the dim shadows of that\r\nawful first night at the White House, must have searched up and down and\r\nalong the labyrinths of history and \"corridors of time,\" everywhere in\r\nthe Past, for any analogy or excuse for the madness of this Secession\r\nmovement--and searched in vain!\r\n\r\nWith his grand and abounding faith in God, how Abraham Lincoln must have\r\nstormed the very gates of Heaven that night with prayer that he might be\r\nthe means of securing Peace and Union to his beloved but distracted\r\nCountry!  How his great heart must have been racked with the\r\nalternations of hope and foreboding--of trustfulness and doubt!\r\nAnxiously he must have looked for the light of the morrow, that he might\r\ngather from the Press, the manner in which his Inaugural had been\r\nreceived.  Not that he feared the North--but the South; how would the\r\nwayward, wilful, passionate South, receive his proffered olive-branch?\r\n\r\nSurely, surely,--thus ran his thoughts--when the brave, and gallant, and\r\ngenerous people of that Section came to read his message of Peace and\r\nGood-will, they must see the suicidal folly of their course!  Surely\r\ntheir hearts must be touched and the mists of prejudice dissolved, so\r\nthat reason would resume her sway, and Reconciliation follow!  A little\r\nmore time for reflection would yet make all things right.  The young men\r\nof the South, fired by the Southern leaders' false appeals, must soon\r\nreturn to reason.  The prairie fire is terrible while it sweeps along,\r\nbut it soon burns out.  When the young men face the emblem of their\r\nNation's glory--the flag of the land of their birth--then will come the\r\nreaction and their false leaders will be hurled from place and power,\r\nand all will again be right.  Yea, when it comes to firing on the old,\r\nold flag, they will not, cannot, do it!  Between the Compromise within\r\ntheir reach, and such Sacrilege as this, they cannot waver long.\r\n\r\nSo, doubtless, all the long night, whether waking or sleeping, the mind\r\nof this true-hearted son of the West, throbbed with the mighty weight of\r\nthe problem entrusted to him for solution, and the vast responsibilities\r\nwhich he had just assumed toward his fellow-men, his Nation, and his\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nAnd when, at last, the long lean frame was thrown upon the couch, and\r\n\"tired Nature's sweet restorer\" held him briefly in her arms, the smile\r\nof hopefulness on the wan cheek told that, despite all the terrible\r\ndifficulties of the situation, the sleeper was sustained by a strong and\r\ncheerful belief in the Providence of God, the Patriotism of the People,\r\nand the efficacy of his Inaugural Peace-offering to the South. But alas,\r\nand alas, for the fallibility of human judgment and human hopes!\r\nInstead of a message of Peace, the South chose to regard it as a message\r\nof Menace;* and it was not received in a much better spirit by some of\r\nthe Northern papers, which could see no good in it--\"no Union spirit in\r\nit\"--but declared that it breathed the spirit of Sectionalism and\r\nmischief, and \"is the knell and requiem of the Union, and the death of\r\nhope.\"\r\n\r\n     [\"Mr. Lincoln fondly regarded his Inaugural as a resistless\r\n     proffering of the olive branch to the South; the Conspirators\r\n     everywhere interpreted it as a challenge to War.\"--Greeley's Am.\r\n     Conflict, vol. i., p. 428.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBitter indeed must have been President Lincoln's disappointment and\r\nsorrow at the reception of his Inaugural.  With the heartiest\r\nforgiveness, in the noblest spirit of paternal kindness, he had\r\ngenerously held out his arms, as far as they could reach, to clasp to\r\nhis heart--to the great heart of the Union--the rash children of the\r\nSouth, if they would but let him.  It was more with sorrow, than in\r\nanger, that he looked upon their contemptuous repulsion of his advances;\r\nand his soul still reproachfully yearned toward these his Southern\r\nbrethren, as did that of a higher than he toward His misguided brethren,\r\nwhen He cried: \"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets,\r\nand stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have\r\ngathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens\r\nunder her wings, and ye would not!\"\r\n\r\nOn the day following his Inauguration, President Lincoln sent to the\r\nUnited States Senate the names of those whom he had chosen to constitute\r\nhis Cabinet, as follows: William H. Seward, of New York, Secretary of\r\nState; Salmon P. Chase, of Ohio, Secretary of the Treasury; Simon\r\nCameron, of Pennsylvania, Secretary of War; Gideon Welles, of\r\nConnecticut, Secretary of the Navy; Caleb B.  Smith, of Indiana,\r\nSecretary of the Interior; Edward Bates, of Missouri, Attorney General;\r\nand Montgomery Blair, of Maryland, Postmaster General.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the President of the rebellious Confederacy,\r\nJefferson Davis, had partly constituted his Cabinet already, as follows:\r\nRobert Toombs, of Georgia, Secretary of State; Charles G.  Memminger, of\r\nSouth Carolina, Secretary of the Treasury; Leroy Pope Walker, of\r\nAlabama, Secretary of War; to whom he afterwards added: Stephen R.\r\nMallory, of Florida, Secretary of the Navy; and John H. Reagan, of\r\nTexas, Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                    THE WAR-DRUM \"ON TO WASHINGTON\"\r\n\r\nScarcely one week had elapsed after the Administration of Mr. Lincoln\r\nbegan, when (March 11th) certain \"Commissioners of the Southern\r\nConfederacy\" (John Forsyth, of Alabama, and Martin J. Crawford, of\r\nGeorgia), appeared at Washington and served a written request upon\r\nthe State Department to appoint an early day when they might present to\r\nthe President of the United States their credentials \"from the\r\nGovernment of the Confederate States of America\" to the Government of\r\nthe United States, and open \"the objects of the mission with which they\r\nare charged.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary Seward, with the President's sanction, declined official\r\nintercourse with Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford, in a \"Memorandum\" (March\r\n15th) reciting their request, etc., in which, after referring to\r\nPresident Lincoln's Inaugural Address--forwarded to them with the\r\n\"Memorandum\" he says: \"A simple reference will be sufficient to satisfy\r\nthose gentlemen that the Secretary of State, guided by the principles\r\ntherein announced, is prevented altogether from admitting or assuming\r\nthat the States referred to by them have, in law or in fact, withdrawn\r\nfrom the Federal Union, or that they could do so in the manner described\r\nby Messrs. Forsyth and Crawford, or in any other manner than with the\r\nconsent and concert of the People of the United States, to be given\r\nthrough a National Convention, to be assembled in conformity with the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution of the United States.  Of course, the\r\nSecretary of State cannot act upon the assumption, or in any way admit,\r\nthat the so-called Confederate States constitute a Foreign Power, with\r\nwhom diplomatic relations ought to be established.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of April, Messrs. Forsyth, Crawford and Roman--as\r\n\"Commissioners of the Southern Confederacy\"--addressed to Secretary\r\nSeward a reply to the \"Memorandum\" aforesaid, in which the following\r\npassage occurs:\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, like the Secretary of State, have no purpose to\r\n'invite or engage in discussion' of the subject on which their two\r\nGovernments are so irreconcilably at variance.  It is this variance that\r\nhas broken up the old Union, the disintegration of which has only begun.\r\n\r\n\"It is proper, however, to advise you that it were well to dismiss the\r\nhopes you seem to entertain that, by any of the modes indicated, the\r\npeople of the Confederate States will ever be brought to submit to the\r\nauthority of the Government of the United States.  You are dealing with\r\ndelusions, too, when you seek to separate our people from our\r\nGovernment, and to characterize the deliberate, Sovereign act of that\r\npeople as a 'perversion of a temporary and partisan excitement.'  If you\r\ncherish these dreams, you will be awakened from them, and find them as\r\nunreal and unsubstantial as others in which you have recently indulged.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned would omit the performance of an obvious duty were they\r\nto fail to make known to the Government of the United States that the\r\npeople of the Confederate States have declared their independence with a\r\nfull knowledge of all the responsibilities of that act, and with as firm\r\na determination to maintain it by all the means with which nature has\r\nendowed them as that which sustained their fathers when they threw off\r\nthe authority of the British Crown.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned clearly understand that you have declined to appoint a\r\nday to enable them to lay the objects of the mission with which they are\r\ncharged, before the President of the United States, because so to do\r\nwould be to recognize the independence and separate nationality of the\r\nConfederate States.  This is the vein of thought that pervades the\r\nmemorandum before us.\r\n\r\n\"The truth of history requires that it should distinctly appear upon the\r\nrecord, that the undersigned did not ask the Government of the United\r\nStates to recognize the independence of the Confederate States.  They\r\nonly asked audience to adjust, in a spirit of amity and peace, the new\r\nrelations springing from a manifest and accomplished revolution in the\r\nGovernment of the late Federal Union.\r\n\r\n\"Your refusal to entertain these overtures for a peaceful solution, the\r\nactive naval and military preparation of this Government, and a formal\r\nnotice to the Commanding General of the Confederate forces in the harbor\r\nof Charleston that the President intends to provision Fort Sumter by\r\nforcible means, if necessary, are viewed by the undersigned, and can\r\nonly be received by the World, as a Declaration of War against the\r\nConfederate States; for the President of the United States knows that\r\nFort Sumter cannot be provisioned without the effusion of blood.\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, in behalf of their Government and people, accept the\r\ngage of battle thus thrown down to them, and, appealing to God and the\r\njudgment of mankind for the righteousness of their Cause, the people of\r\nthe Confederate States will defend their liberties to the last, against\r\nthis flagrant and open attempt at their subjugation to Sectional power.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now, for a moment, glance at the condition of Fort Sumter, and of\r\nthe Government with regard to it:\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of March, the day after President Lincoln had taken his oath\r\nof office, there was placed in his hands a letter of Major Anderson,\r\ncommanding at Fort Sumter, in which that officer, under date of the 28th\r\nof February, expressed the opinion that \"reinforcements could not be\r\nthrown into that fort within the time for his relief rendered necessary\r\nby the limited supply of provisions, and with a view of holding\r\npossession of the same, with a force of less than twenty thousand good\r\nand well-disciplined men.\"\r\n\r\n     [President Lincoln's first Message, July 4, 1861.]\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General Winfield Scott concurred in that opinion, and as the\r\nprovisions in the Fort would be exhausted before any such force could be\r\nraised and brought to the ground, evacuation and safe withdrawal of the\r\nFederal garrison from the Fort became a Military necessity, and was so\r\nregarded by the Administration.\r\n\r\n\"It was believed, however\"--in the language of Mr. Lincoln himself, in\r\nhis first Message to Congress--\"that to so abandon that position, under\r\nthe circumstances, would be utterly ruinous: that the necessity under\r\nwhich it was to be done would not be fully understood; that by many it\r\nwould be construed as a part of a voluntary policy; that at home it\r\nwould discourage the friends of the Union, embolden its adversaries, and\r\ngo far to insure to the latter a recognition abroad; that in fact it\r\nwould be our National destruction consummated.  This could not be\r\nallowed.  Starvation was not yet upon the garrison; and ere it would be\r\nreached, Fort Pickens might be reinforced.  This last would be a clear\r\nindication of policy, and would better enable the country to accept the\r\nevacuation of Fort Sumter as a Military necessity.\"\r\n\r\nOwing to misconception or otherwise, an order to reinforce Fort Pickens\r\nwas not carried out, and an expedition to relieve Fort Sumter was then\r\nordered to be dispatched.  On the 8th of April President Lincoln, by\r\nmessenger, notified Governor Pickens of South Carolina, \"that he might\r\nexpect an attempt would be made to provision the fort; and that if the\r\nattempt should not be resisted there would be no effort to throw in men,\r\narms, or ammunition, without further notice, or in case of an attack\r\nupon the fort.\"\r\n\r\nA crisis was evidently approaching, and public feeling all over the\r\nCountry was wrought up to the highest degree of tension and stood\r\ntip-toe with intense expectancy.  The test of the doctrine of Secession\r\nwas about to be made there, in the harbor of Charleston, upon which the\r\neyes of Patriot and Rebel were alike feverishly bent.\r\n\r\nThere, in Charleston harbor, grimly erect, stood the octagon-shaped Fort\r\nSumter, mid-way of the harbor entrance, the Stars and Stripes proudly\r\nwaving from its lofty central flagstaff, its guns bristling on every\r\nside through the casemates and embrasures, as if with a knowledge of\r\ntheir defensive power.\r\n\r\nAbout equidistant from Fort Sumter on either side of the\r\nharbor-entrance, were the Rebel works at Fort Moultrie and Battery Bee\r\non Sullivan's Island, on the one side, and Cummings Point Battery, on\r\nMorris Island, on the other-besides a number of other batteries facing\r\nseaward along the sea-coast line of Morris Island.  Further in, on the\r\nsame side of the harbor, and but little further off from Fort Sumter,\r\nstood Fort Johnson on James Island, while Castle Pinckney and a Floating\r\nBattery were between the beleagured Fort and the city of Charleston.\r\n\r\nThus, the Federal Fort was threatened with the concentrated fire of\r\nthese well-manned Rebel fortifications on all sides, and in its then\r\ncondition was plainly doomed; for, while the swarming Rebels, unmolested\r\nby Fort Sumter, had been permitted to surround that Fort with frowning\r\nbatteries, whose guns outnumbered those of the Fort, as ten to one, and\r\nwhose caliber was also superior, its own condition was anything but that\r\nof readiness for the inevitable coming encounter.\r\n\r\nThat the officers' quarters, barracks, and other frame-work wooden\r\nbuildings should have been permitted to remain as a standing invitation\r\nto conflagration from bombardment, can only be accounted for on the\r\nsupposition that the gallant officer in command, himself a Southerner,\r\nwould not believe it possible that the thousands of armed Americans by\r\nwhom he was threatened and encircled, could fire upon the flag of their\r\nown native Country.  He and his garrison of seventy men, were soon to\r\nlearn the bitter truth, amid a tempest of bursting shot and shell, the\r\nfurnace-heat of crackling walls, and suffocating volumes of dense smoke\r\nproduced by an uncontrollable conflagration.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel leaders at Washington had prevented an attack in January upon\r\nthe forts in the harbor of Charleston, and at Pensacola.--[McPherson's\r\nHistory of the Rebellion, p.  112.]--In consequence of which failure to\r\nproceed to the last extremity at once, the energies of the Rebellion had\r\nperceptibly diminished.\r\n\r\nSaid the Mobile Mercury: \"The country is sinking into a fatal apathy,\r\nand the spirit and even the patriotism of the people is oozing out,\r\nunder this do-nothing policy.  If something is not done pretty soon,\r\ndecisive, either evacuation or expulsion, the whole country will become\r\nso disgusted with the sham of Southern independence that the first\r\nchance the people get at a popular election they will turn the whole\r\nmovement topsy-turvy so bad that it never on Earth can be righted\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln, however, the Rebel authorities at\r\nMontgomery lost no time, but strained every nerve to precipitate War.\r\nThey felt that there was danger to the cause of Secession in delay; that\r\nthere were wavering States outside the Confederacy, like Virginia, that\r\nmight be dragged into the Confederacy by prompt and bloody work; and\r\nwavering States within, like Alabama, that must be kept in by similar\r\nmeans.  Their emissaries were busy everywhere in the South, early in\r\nApril, preaching an instant crusade against the old flag--inciting the\r\npeople to demand instant hostilities against Fort Sumter--and to cross a\r\nRubicon of blood, over which there could be no return.\r\n\r\nMany of the Rebel leaders seemed to be haunted by the fear (no doubt\r\nwell founded) that unless blood was shed--unless an impassable barrier,\r\ncrimsoned with human gore, was raised between the new Confederacy and\r\nthe old Union--there would surely be an ever-present danger of that\r\nConfederacy falling to pieces.  Hence they were now active in working\r\nthe people up to the required point of frenzy.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of their speeches, may be quoted that of Roger A. Pryor,\r\nof Virginia, who, at Charleston, April 10, 1861, replying to a serenade,\r\nsaid:--[Charleston Mercury's report.]\r\n\r\n'Gentlemen, I thank you, especially that you have at last annihilated\r\nthis accursed Union [Applause] reeking with corruption, and insolent\r\nwith excess of tyranny.  Thank God, it is at last blasted and riven by\r\nthe lightning wrath of an outraged and indignant people.  [Loud\r\napplause.]  Not only is it gone, but gone forever.  [Cries of, 'You're\r\nright,' and applause.] In the expressive language of Scripture, it is\r\nwater spilt upon the ground, which cannot be gathered up.  [Applause.]\r\nLike Lucifer, son of the morning, it has fallen, never to rise again.\r\n[Continued applause.]\r\n\r\n\"For my part, gentlemen,\" he continued, as soon as he could be heard,\r\n\"if Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin to-morrow were to abdicate their\r\noffices and were to give me a blank sheet of paper to write the\r\ncondition of re-annexation to the defunct Union, I would scornfully\r\nspurn the overture.  * * *  I invoke you, and I make it in some sort a\r\npersonal appeal--personal so far as it tends to our assistance in\r\nVirginia--I do invoke you, in your demonstrations of popular opinion, in\r\nyour exhibitions of official intent, to give no countenance to this idea\r\nof reconstruction.  [Many voices, emphatically, 'never,' and applause.]\r\n\r\n\"In Virginia,\" resumed he, \"they all say, if reduced to the dread\r\ndilemma of this memorable alternative, they will espouse the cause of\r\nthe South as against the interest of the Northern Confederacy, but they\r\nwhisper of reconstruction, and they say Virginia must abide in the\r\nUnion, with the idea of reconstructing the Union which you have\r\nannihilated.  I pray you, gentlemen, rob them of that idea.  Proclaim to\r\nthe World that upon no condition, and under no circumstances, will South\r\nCarolina ever again enter into political association with the\r\nAbolitionists of New England.  [Cries of 'never,' and applause.]\r\n\r\n\"Do not distrust Virginia,\" he continued; \"as sure as tomorrow's sun\r\nwill rise upon us, just so sure will Virginia be a member of this\r\nSouthern Confederation.  [Applause.]  And I will tell you, gentlemen,\r\nwhat will put her in the Southern Confederacy in less than an hour by\r\nShrewsbury clock--STRIKE A BLOW!  [Tremendous applause.]  The very\r\nmoment that blood is shed, old Virginia will make common cause with her\r\nsisters of the South.  [Applause.]  It is impossible she should do\r\notherwise.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of the necessity of \"Striking a Blow\"--of the immediate\r\n\"shedding of blood\"--was not only discussed before the Southern people\r\nfor the purpose of inflaming their rebellious zeal, but was also the\r\nsubject of excited agitation in the Confederate Cabinet at this time.\r\n\r\nIn a speech made by ex-United States Senator Clemens of Alabama, at\r\nHuntsville, Alabama, at the close of the Rebellion, he told the\r\nAlabamians how their State, which, as we have seen, was becoming\r\ndecidedly shaky in its allegiance to the \"Sham of Southern\r\nIndependence,\" was kept in the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"In 1861, shortly after the Confederate Government was put in\r\noperation, I was in the city of Montgomery.  One day (April 11, 1861) I\r\nstepped into the office of the Secretary of War, General Walker, and\r\nfound there, engaged in a very excited discussion, Mr. Jefferson Davis\r\n(the President), Mr. Memminger (Secretary of the Treasury), Mr. Benjamin\r\n(Attorney-General), Mr. Gilchrist, a member of our Legislature from\r\nLoundes county, and a number of other prominent gentlemen.  They were\r\ndiscussing the propriety of immediately opening fire on Fort Sumter, to\r\nwhich General Walker, the Secretary of War, appeared to be opposed.  Mr.\r\nGilchrist said to him, 'Sir, unless you sprinkle blood in the face of\r\nthe people of Alabama, they will be back in the old Union in less than\r\nten days!'  THE NEXT DAY GENERAL BEAUREGARD OPENED HIS BATTERIES ON\r\nSUMTER, AND ALABAMA WAS SAVED TO THE CONFEDERACY.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of April, G. T. Beauregard, \"Brigadier General Commanding\"\r\nthe \"Provisional Army C. S. A.\"  at Charleston, S. C., notified the\r\nConfederate Secretary of War (Walker) at Montgomery, Ala., that \"An\r\nauthorized messenger from President Lincoln has just informed Gov.\r\nPickens and myself that provisions will be sent to Fort Sumter\r\npeaceably, or otherwise by force.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th, Confederate Secretary Walker telegraphed to Beauregard: \"If\r\nyou have no doubt of the authorized character of the agent who\r\ncommunicated to, you the intention of the Washington Government to\r\nsupply Fort Sumter by force, you will at once demand its evacuation,\r\nand, if this is refused, proceed, in such manner as you may determine,\r\nto reduce it.\"  To this Beauregard at once replied: \"The demand will be\r\nmade to-morrow at 12 o'clock.\"  Thereupon the Confederate Secretary\r\ntelegraphed again: \"Unless there are special reasons connected with your\r\nown condition, it is considered proper that you should make the demand\r\nat an earlier hour.\"  And Beauregard answered: \"The reasons are special\r\nfor 12 o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 11th General Beauregard notified Secretary Walker: \"The demand\r\nwas sent at 2 P. M., and until 6 was allowed for the answer.\"  The\r\nSecretary desiring to have the reply of Major Anderson, General\r\nBeauregard telegraphed: \"Major Anderson replies: 'I have the honor to\r\nacknowledge the receipt of your communication demanding the evacuation\r\nof this Fort, and to say in reply thereto that it is a demand with which\r\nI regret that my sense of honor and of my obligation to my Government\r\nprevent my compliance.'  He adds, verbally, 'I will await the first\r\nshot, and, if you do not batter us to pieces, we will be starved out in\r\na few days.'\"\r\n\r\nTo this, the Confederate Secretary at once responded with: \"Do not\r\ndesire needlessly to bombard Fort Sumter.  If Major Anderson will state\r\nthe time at which, as indicated by himself, he will evacuate, and agree\r\nthat, in the mean time, he will not use his guns against us unless ours\r\nshould be employed against Fort Sumter, you are authorized thus to avoid\r\nthe effusion of blood.  If this or its equivalent be refused, reduce the\r\nFort, as your judgment decides to be the most practicable.\"\r\n\r\nAt 11 o'clock that night (April 11) General Beauregard sent to Major\r\nAnderson, by the hands of his aides-de-camp, Messrs. Chesnut and Lee, a\r\nfurther communication, in which, after alluding to the Major's verbal\r\nobservation, the General said: \"If you will state the time at which you\r\nwill evacuate Fort Sumter, and agree that in the mean time you will not\r\nuse your guns against us unless ours shall be employed against Fort\r\nSumter, we shall abstain from opening fire upon you.  Col. Chesnut and\r\nCapt. Lee are authorized by me to enter into such an agreement with you.\r\nYou are therefore requested to communicate to them an open answer.\"\r\n\r\nTo this, Major Robert Anderson, at 2.30 A.M. of the 12th, replied \"that,\r\ncordially uniting with you in the desire to avoid the useless effusion\r\nof blood, I will, if provided with the necessary means of\r\ntransportation, evacuate Fort Sumter by noon on the 15th inst., should I\r\nnot receive prior to that time, controlling instructions from my\r\nGovernment, or additional supplies, and that I will not in the mean time\r\nopen my fire upon your forces unless compelled to do so by some hostile\r\nact against this Fort or the flag of my Government, by the forces under\r\nyour command, or by some portion of them, or by the perpetration of some\r\nact showing a hostile intention on your part against this Fort or the\r\nflag it bears.\"  Thereupon General Beauregard telegraphed Secretary\r\nWalker: \"He would not consent.  I write to-day.\"\r\n\r\nAt 3.20 A.M., Major Anderson received from Messrs.  Chesnut and Lee a\r\nnotification to this effect: \"By authority of Brigadier General\r\nBeauregard, commanding the Provisional Forces of the Confederate States,\r\nwe have the honor to notify you that he will open the fire of his\r\nbatteries on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time.\"  And a later\r\ndispatch from General Beauregard to Secretary Walker, April 12,\r\nlaconically stated: \"WE OPENED FIRE AT 4.30.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the hour and the minute had come, for which the Slave Power of\r\nthe South had for thirty years so impatiently longed.  At last the\r\nmoment had come, when all the long-treasured vengeance of the South\r\n--outgrown from questions of Tariff, of Slavery, and of Secession--was to\r\nbe poured out in blood and battle; when the panoplied powers and forces\r\nof rebellious confederated States, standing face to face with the\r\nresolute patriotism of an outraged Union, would belch forth flame and\r\nfury and hurtling missiles upon the Federal Fort and the old flag\r\nfloating o'er it.\r\n\r\nAnd whose the sacrilegious hand that dared be first raised against his\r\nCountry and his Country's flag?  Stevens's mortar battery at Sullivan's\r\nIsland is ready to open, when a lean, long-haired old man, with eyes\r\nblazing in their deep fanatical sockets, totters hastily forward and\r\nravenously seizing in his bony hands a lanyard, pulls the string, and,\r\nwith a flash and roar, away speeds the shrieking shell on its mission of\r\ndestruction; and, while shell after shell, and shot after shot, from\r\nbattery after battery, screams a savage accompaniment to the boom and\r\nflash and bellow of the guns, that lean old man works his clutched\r\nfingers in an ecstasy of fiendish pleasure, and chuckles: \"Aye, I told\r\nthem at Columbia that night, that the defense of the South is only to be\r\nsecured through the lead of South Carolina; and, old as I am, I had come\r\nhere to join them in that lead--and I have done it.\"\r\n\r\n     [Edmund Ruffin, see p.  100.  This theory of the necessity of South\r\n     Carolina leading, had long been held, as in the following, first\r\n     published in the New York Tribune, July 3, 1862, which, among other\r\n     letters, was found in the house of William H.  Trescot, on\r\n     Barnwell's Island, South Carolina, when re-occupied by United\r\n     States troops:\r\n\r\n     \"VIRGINIA CONVENTION, May 3, 1851\r\n\r\n     \"My DEAR, SIR:--You misunderstood my last letter, if you supposed\r\n     that I intended to visit South Carolina this Spring.  I am\r\n     exceedingly obliged to you for your kind invitations, and it would\r\n     afford me the highest pleasure to interchange in person, sentiments\r\n     with a friend whose manner of thinking so closely agrees with my\r\n     own.  But my engagements here closely confine me to this city, and\r\n     deny me such a gratification.\r\n\r\n     \"I would be especially glad to be in Charleston next week, and\r\n     witness the proceedings of your Convention of Delegates from the\r\n     Southern Rights Associations.  The condition of things in your\r\n     State deeply interests me.  Her wise foresight and manly\r\n     independence have placed her, as the head of the South, to whom\r\n     alone true-hearted men can look with any hope or pleasure.\r\n\r\n     \"Momentous are the consequences which depend upon your action.\r\n     Which party will prevail?  The immediate Secessionists, or those\r\n     who are opposed to separate State action at this time?  For my part\r\n     I forbear to form a wish.  Were I a Carolinian, it would be very\r\n     different; but when I consider the serious effects the decision may\r\n     have on your future weal or woe, I feel that a citizen of a State\r\n     which has acted as Virginia, has no right to interfere, even by a\r\n     wish.\r\n\r\n     \"If the General Government allows you peaceably and freely to\r\n     Secede, neither Virginia, nor any other Southern State, would, in\r\n     my opinion, follow you at present.  But what would be the effect\r\n     upon South Carolina?  Some of our best friends have supposed that\r\n     it would cut off Charleston from the great Western trade, which she\r\n     is now striking for, and would retard very greatly the progress of\r\n     your State.  I confess that I think differently.  I believe\r\n     thoroughly in our own theories, and that, even if Charleston did\r\n     not grow quite as fast in her trade with other States, yet the\r\n     relief from Federal taxation would vastly stimulate your\r\n     prosperity.  If so, the prestige of the Union would be destroyed,\r\n     and you would be the nucleus for a Southern Confederation at no\r\n     distant day.\r\n\r\n     \"But I do not doubt, from all I have been able toe to learn that the\r\n     Federal Government would use force, beginning with the form most\r\n     embarrassing to you, and least calculated to excite sympathy.  I\r\n     mean a naval blockade.  In that event, could you stand the reaction\r\n     feeling which the suffering commerce of Charleston would probably\r\n     manifest?  Would you not lose that in which your strength consists,\r\n     the union of your people?  I do not mean to imply an opinion, I\r\n     only ask the question.\r\n\r\n     \"If you could force this blockade, and bring the Government to\r\n     direct force, the feeling in Virginia would be very great.  I trust\r\n     in God it would bring her to your aid.  But it would be wrong in me\r\n     to deceive you by speaking certainly.  I cannot express the deep\r\n     mortification I have felt at her course this Winter.  But I do not\r\n     believe that the course of the Legislature is a fair expression of\r\n     popular feeling.  In the East, at least, the great majority\r\n     believes in the right of Secession, and feels the deepest sympathy\r\n     with Carolina in her opposition to measures which they regard as\r\n     she does.  But the West--Western Virginia--there is the rub!  Only\r\n     60,000 slaves to 494,000 whites!  When I consider this fact, and\r\n     the kind of argument which has been heard in this body, I cannot\r\n     but regard with the greatest fear the question whether Virginia\r\n     would assist Carolina in such an issue.\r\n\r\n     \"I must acknowledge, my dear sir, that I look to the future with\r\n     almost as much apprehension as hope.  You well object to the term\r\n     Democrat.  Democracy, in its original philosophical sense, is\r\n     indeed incompatible with Slavery and the whole system of Southern\r\n     society.  Yet, if you look back, what change will you find made in\r\n     any of your State Constitutions, or in our legislation--that is, in\r\n     its general course--for the last fifty years, which was not in the\r\n     direction of this Democracy?  Do not its principles and theories\r\n     become daily more fixed in our practice?  (I had almost said in the\r\n     opinions of our people, did I not remember with pleasure the great\r\n     improvement of opinion in regard to the abstract question of\r\n     Slavery).  And if such is the case, what are we to hope in the\r\n     future?  I do not hesitate to say that if the question is raised\r\n     between Carolina and the Federal Government, and the latter\r\n     prevails, the last hope of republican government, and, I fear, of\r\n     Southern civilization, is gone.  Russia will then be a better\r\n     government than ours.\r\n\r\n     \"I fear that the confusion and interruptions amid which I write\r\n     have made this rather a rambling letter.

TRESCOT, ESQ.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning's New York herald, in its Charleston dispatch of April 12,\r\nannounced to the World that \"The first shot [fired at Fort Sumter] from\r\nStevens's battery was fired by the venerable Edmund Ruffin, of\r\nVirginia,\" and added, \"That ball will do more for the cause of\r\nSecession, in Virginia, than volumes of stump speeches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Soon,\" says Greeley in his History, \"the thunder of fifty heavy\r\nbreaching cannon, in one grand volley, followed by the crashing and\r\ncrumbling of brick, stone, and mortar around and above them, apprized\r\nthe little garrison that their stay must necessarily be short.\"\r\n\r\nSays an eye-witness of the bombardment: \"Shells burst with the greatest\r\nrapidity in every portion of the work, hurling the loose brick and stone\r\nin all directions, breaking the windows and setting fire to whatever\r\nwoodwork they burst against.  * * *  The firing from the batteries on\r\nCumming's Point was scattered over the whole of the gorge or rear of the\r\nFort, till it looked like a sieve.  The explosion of shells, and the\r\nquantity of deadly missiles that were hurled in every direction and at\r\nevery instant of time, made it almost certain death to go out of the\r\nlower tier of casemates, and also made the working of the barbette or\r\nupper (uncovered) guns, which contained all our heaviest metal, and by\r\nwhich alone we could throw shells, quite impossible.\r\n\r\n\"During the first day there was hardly an instant of time that there was\r\na cessation of the whizzing of balls, which were sometimes coming half a\r\ndozen at once.  There was not a portion of the work which was not taken\r\nin reverse from mortars.  * * *  During Friday, the officers' barracks\r\nwere three times set on fire by the shells and three times put out under\r\nthe most galling and destructive cannonade.\r\n\r\n\"For the fourth time, the barracks were set on fire early on Saturday\r\nmorning, and attempts were made to extinguish the flames; but it was\r\nsoon discovered that red-hot shot were being thrown into the Fort with\r\nfearful rapidity, and it became evident that it would be impossible to\r\nput out the conflagration.  The whole garrison was then set to work, or\r\nas many as could be spared, to remove the powder from the magazines,\r\nwhich was desperate work, rolling barrels of powder through the fire.  *\r\n* *  After the barracks were well on fire, the batteries directed upon\r\nFort Sumter increased their cannonading to a rapidity greater than had\r\nbeen attained before.\"\r\n\r\n\"About this time, the shells and ammunition in the upper\r\nservice-magazines exploded, scattering the tower and upper portions of\r\nthe building in every direction.  The crash of the beams, the roar of\r\nthe flames, and the shower of fragments of the Fort, with the blackness\r\nof the smoke, made the scene indescribably terrific and grand.  This\r\ncontinued for several hours.  * * * \"\r\n\r\n\"There was not a portion of the Fort where a breath of air could be got\r\nfor hours, except through a wet cloth.  The fire spread to the men's\r\nquarters on the right hand and on the left, and endangered the powder\r\nwhich had been taken out of the magazines.  The men went through the\r\nfire, and covered the barrels with wet cloths, but the danger of the\r\nFort's blowing up became so imminent that they were obliged to heave the\r\nbarrels out of the embrasures.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Anderson's official report tells the whole story briefly and well,\r\nin these words:\r\n\r\n               \"STEAMSHIP BALTIC, OFF SANDY HOOK\r\n\r\n               \"April 18, 1861, 10.30 A.M., VIA NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\"Having defended Fort Sumter for thirty-four hours, until the quarters\r\nwere entirely burnt, the main gates destroyed by fire, the gorge walls\r\nseriously injured, the magazine surrounded by flames, and its door\r\nclosed from the effects of heat; four barrels and three cartridges of\r\npowder only being available, and no provisions remaining but pork, I\r\naccepted terms of evacuation offered by General Beauregard--being the\r\nsame offered by him on the 11th inst., prior to the commencement of\r\nhostilities--and marched out of the Fort on Sunday afternoon, the 14th\r\ninstant, with colors flying and drums beating, bringing away company and\r\nprivate property, and saluting my flag with fifty guns.\r\n\r\n                         \"ROBERT ANDERSON,\r\n                    \"Major 1st Artillery, Commanding.\r\n\r\n\"HON. SIMON CAMERON,\r\n\"Secretary of War, Washington.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring all this thirty-four hours of bombardment, the South rejoiced\r\nwith exceeding great joy that the time had come for the vindication of\r\nits peculiar ideas of State and other rights, even though it be with\r\nflames and the sword.  At Charleston, the people were crazy with\r\nexultation and wine-feasting and drinking being the order of the day and\r\nnight.  But for the surrender, Fort Sumter would have been stormed that\r\nSunday night.  As it was, Sunday was turned into a day of general\r\njubilation, and while the people cheered and filled the streets, all the\r\nChurches of Charleston celebrated, with more or less devotional fervor\r\nand ceremony, the bloodless victory.\r\n\r\nAt Montgomery, the Chiefs of the Confederate Government were serenaded.\r\n\"Salvos of artillery were fired, and the whole population seemed to be\r\nin an ecstasy of triumph.\"--[McPherson's History of the Rebellion, p.\r\n114]\r\n\r\nThe Confederate Secretary of War, flushed with the success, predicted\r\nthat the Confederate flag \"will, before the first of May, float over the\r\ndome of the old Capitol at Washington\" and \"will eventually float over\r\nFaneuil Hall, in Boston.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Maryland to Mexico, the protests of Union men of the South were\r\nunheard in the fierce clamor of \"On to Washington!\"\r\n\r\nThe Richmond Examiner said: \"There never was half the unanimity among\r\nthe people before, nor a tithe of the zeal upon any subject, that is now\r\nmanifested to take Washington.  From the mountain tops and valleys to\r\nthe shores of the sea, there is one wild shout of fierce resolve to\r\ncapture Washington City at all and every human hazard.\"\r\n\r\nSo also, the Mobile Advertiser enthusiastically exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"We are prepared to fight, and the enemy is not.  Now is the time for\r\naction, while he is yet unprepared.  Let the fife sound 'Gray Jackets\r\nover the Border,' and let a hundred thousand men, with such arms as they\r\ncan snatch, get over the border as quickly as they can.  Let a division\r\nenter every Northern border State, destroy railroad connection to\r\nprevent concentration of the enemy, and the desperate strait of these\r\nStates, the body of Lincoln's country, will compel him to a peace--or\r\ncompel his successor, should Virginia not suffer him to escape from his\r\ndoomed capital.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on Friday morning, the 12th of April, as we have seen, that the\r\nfirst Rebel shot was fired at Fort Sumter.  It was on Saturday afternoon\r\nand evening that the terms of surrender were agreed to, and on Sunday\r\nafternoon that the Federal flag was saluted and hauled down, and the\r\nsurrender completed.  On Monday morning, being the 15th of April, in all\r\nthe great Northern Journals of the day appeared the following:\r\n\r\n\"PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\"WHEREAS, the laws of the United States have been for some time past,\r\nand now are, opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, in the\r\nStates of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi,\r\nLouisiana, and Texas, by Combinations too powerful to be suppressed by\r\nthe ordinary course of Judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in\r\nthe Marshals by law; now, therefore I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the\r\nUnited States, in virtue of the power in me vested by the Constitution\r\nand the laws, have thought fit to call forth, and hereby do call forth,\r\nthe Militia of the several States of the Union to the aggregate number\r\nof 75,000, in order to suppress said Combinations, and to cause the laws\r\nto be duly executed.\r\n\r\n\"The details for this object will be immediately communicated to the\r\nState authorities through the War Department.  I appeal to all loyal\r\ncitizens to favor, facilitate, and aid this effort to maintain the\r\nhonor, the integrity, and existence of our National Union, and the\r\nperpetuity of popular government, and to redress wrongs already long\r\nenough endured.  I deem it proper to say that the first service assigned\r\nto the forces hereby called forth, will probably be to repossess the\r\nforts, places, and property which have been seized from the Union; and\r\nin every event the utmost care will be observed, consistently with the\r\nobjects aforesaid, to avoid any devastation, any destruction of, or\r\ninterference with, property, or any disturbance of peaceful citizens of\r\nany part of the Country; and I hereby command the persons composing the\r\nCombinations aforesaid, to disperse and retire peaceably to their\r\nrespective abodes, within twenty days from this date.\r\n\r\n\"Deeming that the present condition of public affairs presents an\r\nextraordinary occasion, I do hereby, in virtue of the power in me vested\r\nby the Constitution, convene both Houses of Congress.  The Senators and\r\nRepresentatives are, therefore, summoned to assemble at their respective\r\nchambers at twelve o'clock, noon, on Thursday, the 4th day of July next,\r\nthen and there to consider and determine such measures as, in their\r\nwisdom, the public safety and interest may seem to demand.\r\n\r\n\"In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n\"Done at the city of Washington, this fifteenth day of April, in the\r\nyear of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-one, and of the\r\nindependence of the United States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\n\"By the President:  ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\"WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in the North the official responses to this Call for troops were\r\nprompt and patriotic, in the Border and Slave States, not yet in\r\nRebellion, they were anything but encouraging.\r\n\r\nThe reply of Governor Burton, of Delaware, was by the issue of a\r\nproclamation \"recommending the formation of volunteer companies for the\r\nprotection of the lives and property of the people of Delaware against\r\nviolence of any sort to which they may be exposed; the companies not\r\nbeing subject to be ordered by the Executive into the United States\r\nservice--the law not vesting him with such authority--but having the\r\noption of offering their services to the General Government for the\r\ndefense of its capital and the support of the Constitution and laws of\r\nthe Country.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Hicks, of Maryland, in like manner, issued a proclamation for\r\nMaryland's quota of the troops, but stated that her four regiments would\r\nbe detailed to serve within the limits of Maryland--or, for the defense\r\nof the National Capital.\r\n\r\nGovernor Letcher, of Virginia, replied: \"The militia of Virginia will\r\nnot be furnished to the powers at Washington for any such use or purpose\r\nas they have in view.  Your object is to subjugate the Southern States,\r\nand a requisition made upon me for such an object--an object, in my\r\njudgment, not within the purview of the Constitution or the Act of 1795\r\n--will not be complied with.  You have chosen to inaugurate Civil War,\r\nand having done so, we will meet it in a spirit as determined as the\r\nAdministration has exhibited toward the South.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Ellis, of North Carolina, replied to Secretary Cameron: \"Your\r\ndispatch is received, and, if genuine--which its extraordinary character\r\nleads me to doubt--I have to say in reply that I regard the levy of\r\ntroops made by the Administration, for the purpose of subjugating the\r\nStates of the South, as in violation of the Constitution and a\r\nusurpation of power.  I can be no party to this wicked violation of the\r\nlaws of the country, and to this War upon the liberties of a free\r\npeople.  You can get no troops from North Carolina.  I will reply more\r\nin detail when your Call is received by mail.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Magoffin, of Kentucky, replied: \"Your dispatch is received.  In\r\nanswer I say emphatically, Kentucky will furnish no troops for the\r\nwicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern States.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Harris, of Tennessee, replied: \"Tennessee will not furnish a\r\nsingle man for Coercion, but fifty thousand, if necessary, for the\r\nDefense of our rights or those of our Southern brethren.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Jackson, of Missouri, replied: \"Your requisition is illegal,\r\nunconstitutional, revolutionary, inhuman, diabolical and cannot be\r\ncomplied with.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Rector, of Arkansas, replied: \"None will be furnished.  The\r\ndemand is only adding insult to injury.\"\r\n\r\nDiscouraging and even insulting as were most of these replies, the\r\nresponses of the Governors of the Free States were, on the other hand,\r\nfull of the ring of true martial Patriotism evoked by the fall of Sumter\r\nand the President's first call for troops.  Twenty millions of Northern\r\nhearts were stirred by that Call, as they had never before been stirred.\r\nParty and faction became for the moment, a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nThe Governors of the Free States made instant proclamation for\r\nvolunteers, and the People responded not by thousands but by hundreds of\r\nthousands.  New York, the Empire State, by her Governor and her\r\nLegislature placed all her tremendous resources at the service of the\r\nUnion; and the great State of Pennsylvania, through Governor Curtin, did\r\nthe same.  Nor were the other States at all behind.\r\n\r\nThe Loyal North felt that Law, Order, Liberty, the existence of the\r\nNation itself was in peril, and must be both saved and vindicated.  Over\r\nhalf a million of men--from the prairies of the West and the hills and\r\ncities of the East--from farms and counting houses, from factories and\r\nmines and workshops--sprang to arms at the Call, and begged to be\r\nenrolled.  The merchants and capitalists throughout the North proffered\r\nto the Government their wealth and influence and best services.  The\r\npress and the people responded as only the press and people of a Free\r\nland can respond--with all their heart and soul.  \"Fort Sumter,\" said\r\none of the journals, \"is lost, but Freedom is saved.  Henceforth, the\r\nLoyal States are a unit in uncompromising hostility to Treason, wherever\r\nplotted, however justified.  Fort Sumter is temporarily lost, but the\r\nCountry is saved.  Live the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nThis, in a nutshell, was the feeling everywhere expressed, whether by\r\nthe great crowds that marched through the streets of Northern cities\r\nwith drums beating and banners flying--cheering wildly for the Union,\r\nsinging Union songs, and compelling those of doubtful loyalty to throw\r\nout to the breeze from their homes the glorified Stars and Stripes--by\r\nthe great majority of newspapers--by the pulpit, by the rostrum, by the\r\nbench, by all of whatever profession or calling in Northern life.  For\r\nthe moment, the voice of the Rebel-sympathizer was hushed in the land,\r\nor so tremendously overborne that it seemed as if there was an absolute\r\nunanimity of love for the Union.\r\n\r\nOf course, in Border-States, bound to the South by ties of lineage and\r\nintermarriage and politics and business association, the feeling could\r\nnot be the same as elsewhere.  There, they were, so to speak, drawn both\r\nways at once, by the beckoning hands of kindred on the one side, and\r\nCountry on the other!  Thus they long waited and hesitated, praying that\r\nsomething might yet happen to save the Union of their fathers, and\r\nprevent the shedding of brothers' blood, by brothers-hoping against\r\nhope-waited, in the belief that a position of armed neutrality might be\r\npermitted to them; and grieved, when they found this could not be.\r\n\r\nEach side to the great Conflict-at-arms naturally enough believed itself\r\nright, and that the other side was the first aggressor; but the judgment\r\nof Mankind has placed the blame where it properly belonged--on the\r\nshoulders of the Rebels.  The calm, clear statement of President\r\nLincoln, in his July Message to Congress, touching the assault and its\r\npreceding history--together with his conclusions--states the whole\r\nmatter in such authentic and convincing manner that it may be said to\r\nhave settled the point beyond further controversy.  After stating that\r\nit \"was resolved to notify the Governor of South Carolina that he might\r\nexpect an attempt would be made to provision the Fort; and that if the\r\nattempt should not be resisted there would be no effort to throw in men,\r\narms, or ammunition, without further notice, or in case of an attack on\r\nthe Fort,\" Mr. Lincoln continues: \"This notice was accordingly given;\r\nwhereupon the Fort was attacked and bombarded to its fall, without even\r\nawaiting the arrival of the provisioning expedition.\"\r\n\r\nThe President then proceeds: \"It is thus seen that the assault upon and\r\nreduction of Fort Sumter was, in no sense, a matter of self-defense on\r\nthe part of the assailants.  They well knew that the garrison in the\r\nFort could, by no possibility, commit aggression upon them.  They knew\r\n--they were expressly notified--that the giving of bread to the few brave\r\nand hungry men of the garrison was all which would on that occasion be\r\nattempted, unless themselves, by resisting so much, should provoke more.\r\nThey knew that this Government desired to keep the garrison in the Fort\r\n--not to assail them--but merely to maintain visible possession, and\r\nthus to preserve the Union from actual and immediate dissolution\r\n--trusting, as hereinbefore stated, to time, discussion, and the\r\nballot-box for final adjustment; and they assailed and reduced the Fort\r\nfor precisely the reverse object--to drive out the visible authority of\r\nthe Federal Union, and thus force it to immediate dissolution.\r\n\r\n\"That this was their object, the Executive well understood; and, having\r\nsaid to them, in the Inaugural Address, 'you can have no conflict\r\nwithout being yourselves the aggressors,' he took pains not only to keep\r\nthis declaration good, but also to keep the case so free from the power\r\nof ingenious sophistry as that the World should not be able to\r\nmisunderstand it.\r\n\r\n\"By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding circumstances, that\r\npoint was reached.  Then and thereby the assailants of the Government\r\nbegan the Conflict of arms, without a gun in sight or in expectancy to\r\nreturn their fire, save only the few in the Fort sent to that harbor\r\nyears before for their own protection, and still ready to give that\r\nprotection in whatever was lawful.  In this act, discarding all else,\r\nthey have forced upon the Country, the distinct issue: 'Immediate\r\ndissolution or blood.'\r\n\r\n\"And this issue embraces more than the fate of these United States.  It\r\npresents to the whole family of Man the question whether a\r\nConstitutional Republic or Democracy--a government of the People by the\r\nsame People--can or cannot maintain its territorial integrity against\r\nits own domestic foes.  It presents the question whether discontented\r\nindividuals, too few in numbers to control administration according to\r\norganic law in any case, can always, upon the pretences made in this\r\ncase, or on any other pretences, or arbitrarily without any pretence,\r\nbreak up their Government, and thus practically put an end to free\r\ngovernment upon the earth.  It forces us to ask: 'Is there in all\r\nrepublics, this inherent and fatal weakness?'  'Must a Government of\r\nnecessity be too strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak\r\nto maintain its own existence?'\r\n\r\n\"So viewing the issue, no choice was left but to call out the War power\r\nof the Government; and so to resist force, employed for its destruction,\r\nby force, for its preservation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Call for Troops was made, as we have seen, on the 15th day of April.\r\nOn the evening of the following day several companies of a Pennsylvania\r\nRegiment reported for duty in Washington.  On the 18th, more\r\nPennsylvania Volunteers, including a company of Artillery, arrived\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of April, the Sixth Massachusetts Regiment--whose progress\r\nthrough New York city had been triumphal-was suddenly and unexpectedly\r\nassailed, in its passage through Baltimore, to the defense of the\r\nNational Capital, by a howling mob of Maryland Secessionists--worked up\r\nto a pitch of States-rights frenzy by Confederate emissaries and\r\ninfluential Baltimore Secession-sympathizers, by news of the sudden\r\nevacuation of the Federal Arsenal at Harper's Ferry, and other exciting\r\ntidings--and had to fight its way through, leaving three soldiers of\r\nthat regiment dead, and a number wounded, behind it.\r\n\r\n     [At a meeting of the \"National Volunteer Association,\" at Monument\r\n     Square, Baltimore, the previous evening, says Greeley's History of\r\n     the American Conflict, page 462, \"None of the speakers directly\r\n     advocated attacks on the Northern troops about to pass through the\r\n     city; but each was open in his hostility to 'Coercion,' and\r\n     ardently exhorted his hearers to organize, arm and drill, for the\r\n     Conflict now inevitable.  Carr (Wilson C. N. Carr) said: 'I do not\r\n     care how many Federal troops are sent to Washington; they will soon\r\n     find themselves surrounded by such an army from Virginia and\r\n     Maryland, that escape to their homes will be impossible; and when\r\n     the 75,000 who are intended to invade the South shall have polluted\r\n     that soil with their touch, the South will exterminate and sweep\r\n     them from the Earth.' (Frantic cheering and yelling).  The meeting\r\n     broke up with stentorian cheers for 'the South' and for 'President\r\n     Davis.\"']\r\n\r\nTen companies of Philadelphia troops, reaching Baltimore at the same\r\ntime, unarmed, were also violently assailed by the crazy mob, and, after\r\na two hours' fight, reached the cars and returned to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWashington City--already, by the Secession of Virginia, cut off from the\r\nSouth--was thus practically cut off from the North as well; and to\r\nisolate it more completely, the telegraph wires were cut down and the\r\nrailroad bridges burned.  A mere handful of regulars, the few volunteers\r\nthat had got through before the outbreak in Baltimore, and a small\r\nnumber of Union residents and Government department clerks--these, under\r\nGeneral Winfield Scott, constituted the paltry force that, for ten days\r\nafter the Call for troops, held the National Capital.\r\n\r\nInformed, as the Rebels must have been, by their swarming spies, of the\r\nweakness of the Federal metropolis, it seems absolutely marvelous that\r\ninstant advantage was not taken of it.\r\n\r\nThe Richmond Examiner, of April 23d, said: \"The capture of Washington\r\nCity is perfectly within the power of Virginia and Maryland, if Virginia\r\nwill only make the effort with her constituted authorities; nor is there\r\na single moment to lose.  * * *  The fanatical yell for the immediate\r\nsubjugation of the whole South is going up hourly from the united voices\r\nof all the North; and, for the purpose of making their work sure, they\r\nhave determined to hold Washington City as the point whence to carry on\r\ntheir brutal warfare.  Our people can take it--they will take it--and\r\nScott, the arch-traitor, and Lincoln, the Beast, combined, cannot\r\nprevent it.  The just indignation of an outraged and deeply injured\r\npeople will teach the Illinois Ape to repeat his race and retrace his\r\njourney across the borders of the Free Negro States still more rapidly\r\nthan he came.  * * *  Great cleansing and purification are needed and\r\nwill be given to that festering sink of iniquity, that wallow of Lincoln\r\nand Scott--the desecrated city of Washington; and many indeed will be\r\nthe carcasses of dogs and caitiff that will blacken the air upon the\r\ngallows before the great work is accomplished.  So let it be!\"\r\n\r\nBut despite all this fanfaronade of brutal bluster, and various\r\nmovements that looked somewhat threatening, and this complete isolation\r\nfor more than a week from the rest of the World, the city of Washington\r\nwas not seized by the Rebels, after all.\r\n\r\nThis nervous condition of affairs, however, existed until the 25th--and\r\nto General Benjamin F. Butler is due the chief credit of putting an end\r\nto it.  It seems he had reached the Susquehanna river at Perryville,\r\nwith his Eighth Massachusetts Regiment on the 20th--the day after the\r\nSixth Massachusetts had been mobbed at Baltimore--and, finding his\r\nfurther progress to Washington via Baltimore, barred by the destruction\r\nof the bridge across the Susquehanna, etc., he at once seized a large\r\nferry steamer, embarked his men on her, steamed down the river and\r\nChesapeake Bay to Annapolis, the capital of Maryland, took possession of\r\nthe frigate Constitution, the Naval Academy, and the city itself,\r\ngathered supplies, and being reinforced by the arrival by water of the\r\nfamous New York Seventh, and other regiments, repaired the branch\r\nrailroad to Annapolis Junction (on the main line of railroad between\r\nBaltimore and Washington), and transferred his column from thence, by\r\ncars, on the 25th, to the National Capital--soon thereafter also taking\r\nmilitary possession of Baltimore, which gave no further trouble to the\r\nUnion Cause.  In the meantime, however, other untoward events to that\r\nCause had happened.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the Call for troops, the Virginia Convention (April 17th)\r\nsecretly voted to Secede from the Union.  An expedition of Virginia\r\ntroops was almost at once started to capture the Federal Arsenal at\r\nHarper's Ferry, which, as has already been intimated, was evacuated\r\nhastily on the night of the 18th, by the handful of Union regulars\r\ngarrisoning it, after a futile effort to destroy the public property and\r\nstores it held.  Another expedition was started to seize the Federal\r\nNavy Yard at Norfolk--a rich prize, containing as it did, between 2,000\r\nand 3,000 pieces of heavy ordnance (300 of them Dahlgrens), three old\r\nline-of-battle ships and a number of frigates, including the Cumberland\r\nand the fine forty-gun steam frigate Merrimac, together with thousands\r\nof kegs of powder and immense stores of other munitions of war, and\r\nsupplies--that had cost in all some $10,000,000.  Without an enemy in\r\nsight, however, this fine Navy Yard was shamefully evacuated, after\r\npartly scuttling and setting fire to the vessels--the Cumberland alone\r\nbeing towed away--and spiking the guns, and doing other not very\r\nmaterial damage.\r\n\r\nSo also, in North Carolina, Rebel influence was equally active.  On the\r\n20th of April Governor Ellis seized the Federal Branch Mint at,\r\nCharlotte, and on the 22d the Federal Arsenal at Fayetteville.  A few\r\ndays thereafter his Legislature authorized him to tender to Virginia\r\n--which had already joined the Confederacy--or to the Government of the\r\nConfederate States itself, the volunteer forces of North Carolina.  And,\r\nalthough at the end of January the people of that State had decided at\r\nthe polls that no Secession Convention be held, yet the subservient\r\nLegislature did not hesitate, on demand, to call one together which met\r\nin May and ordained such Secession.\r\n\r\nThus, by the end of May, 1861, the Confederacy had grown to comprise\r\nnine instead of seven States, and the Confederate troops were\r\nconcentrating on Richmond--whither the Rebel Government was soon to\r\nremove, from Montgomery.\r\n\r\nBy this time also not only had the ranks of the regular Union Army been\r\nfilled and largely added to, but 42,000 additional volunteers had been\r\ncalled out by President Lincoln; and the blockade of the Southern ports\r\n(including those of Virginia and North Carolina) that had been\r\nproclaimed by him, was, despite all obstacles, now becoming effectual\r\nand respected.\r\n\r\nWashington City and its suburbs, by the influx of Union volunteers, had\r\nduring this month become a vast armed camp; the Potomac river had been\r\ncrossed and the Virginia hills (including Arlington heights) which\r\noverlooked the Federal Capital, had been occupied and fortified by Union\r\ntroops; the young and gallant Colonel Ellsworth had been killed by a\r\nVirginia Rebel while pulling down a Rebel flag in Alexandria; and\r\nGeneral Benjamin F. Butler, in command at Fortress Monroe, had by an\r\ninspiration, solved one of the knottiest points confronting our armies,\r\nby declaring of three Negroes who had fled from their master so as to\r\nescape working on Rebel fortifications, that they should not be returned\r\nto that master--under the Fugitive Slave Law, as demanded by a Rebel\r\nofficer with a flag of truce--but were confiscated \"property,\" and would\r\nbe retained, as \"contraband of war.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, too, that the New Orleans Picayune fell into\r\nline with other unscrupulous Rebel sheets, by gravely declaring that:\r\n\"All the Massachusetts troops now in Washington are Negroes, with the\r\nexception of two or three drummer boys.  General Butler, in command, is\r\na native of Liberia.  Our readers may recollect old Ben, the barber, who\r\nkept a shop in Poydras street, and emigrated to Liberia with a small\r\ncompetence.  General Butler is his son.\"  Little did the writer of that\r\nparagraph dream how soon New Orleans would crouch at the very feet of\r\nthat same General!\r\n\r\nAnd now, while the armed hosts on either side are assembling in hostile\r\narray, or resting on their arms, preliminary to the approaching fray of\r\nbattle, let us glance at the alleged causes underlying this great\r\nRebellion against the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                        THE CAUSES OF SECESSION.\r\n\r\nIn preceding Chapters of this work, it has been briefly shown, that from\r\nthe very hour in which the Republic of the United States was born, there\r\nhave not been wanting, among its own citizens, those who hated it, and\r\nwhen they could not rule, were always ready to do what they could, by\r\nConspiracy, Sedition, Mutiny, Nullification, Secession, or otherwise, to\r\nweaken and destroy it.  This fact, and the processes by which the\r\nConspirators worked, is very well stated, in his documentary \"History of\r\nthe Rebellion,\" by Edward McPherson, when he says: \"In the Slaveholding\r\nStates, a considerable body of men have always been disaffected to the\r\nUnion.  They resisted the adoption of the National Constitution, then\r\nsought to refine away the rights and powers of the General Government,\r\nand by artful expedients, in a series of years, using the excitements\r\ngrowing out of passing questions, finally perverted the sentiments of\r\nlarge masses of men, and prepared them for Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nBefore giving further incontestable proofs establishing this fact, and\r\nbefore endeavoring to sift out the true cause or causes of Secession,\r\nlet us first examine such evidences as are submitted by him in support\r\nof his proposition.\r\n\r\nThe first piece of testimony, is an extract from an unpublished journal\r\nof U. S. Senator Maclay of Pennsylvania, from March 4, 1789, to March 3,\r\n1791--the period of the First Congress under the Federal Constitution.\r\nIt runs thus:\r\n\r\n\"1789, June 9.--In relation to the Tariff Bill, the affair of confining\r\nthe East India Trade to the citizens of America had been negatived, and\r\na committee had been appointed to report on this business.  The report\r\ncame in with very high duties, amounting to a prohibition.  But a new\r\nphenomenon had made its appearance in the House (meaning the Senate)\r\nsince Friday.\r\n\r\n\"Pierce Butler, from South Carolina, had taken his seat, and flamed like\r\na meteor.  He arraigned the whole Impost law, and then charged\r\n(indirectly) the whole Congress with a design of oppressing South\r\nCarolina.  He cried out for encouraging the Danes and Swedes, and\r\nforeigners of every kind, to come and take away our produce.  In fact he\r\nwas for a Navigation Act reversed.\r\n\r\n\"June 11.--Attended at the hall as usual.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ralph Izard and Mr. Butler opposed the whole of the drawbacks in\r\nevery shape whatever.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. (William) Grayson, of Virginia, warm on this subject, said we were\r\nnot ripe for such a thing.  We were a new Nation, and had no business\r\nfor any such regulations--a Nation /sui generis/.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. (Richard Henry) Lee (of Virginia) said drawbacks were right, but\r\nwould be so much abused, he could not think of admitting them.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. (Oliver) Ellsworth (of Connecticut) said New England rum would be\r\nexported, instead of West India, to obtain the drawback.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it best to say a few words in reply to each.  We were a new\r\nNation, it was true, but we were not a new People.  We were composed of\r\nindividuals of like manners, habits, and customs with the European\r\nNations.  What, therefore, had been found useful among them, came well\r\nrecommended by experience to us.  Drawbacks stand as an example in this\r\npoint of view to us.  If the thing was right in itself, there could be\r\nno just argument drawn against the use of a thing from the abuse of it.\r\nIt would be the duty of Government to guard against abuses, by prudent\r\nappointments and watchful attention to officers.  That as to changing\r\nthe kind of rum, I thought the collection Bill would provide for this,\r\nby limiting the exportation to the original casks and packages.  I said\r\na great deal more, but really did not feel much interest either way.\r\nBut the debates were very lengthy.\r\n\r\n\"Butler flamed away, and THREATENED A DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION, with\r\nregard to his State, as sure as God was in the firmament.  He scattered\r\nhis remarks over the whole Impost bill, calling it partial, oppressive,\r\netc., and solely calculated to oppress South Carolina, and yet ever and\r\nanon declaring how clear of local views and how candid and dispassionate\r\nhe was.  He degenerates into mere declamation.  His State would live\r\nfree, or die glorious.\"\r\n\r\nThe next piece of evidence is General Jackson's letter to Rev. A. J.\r\nCrawford, as follows:\r\n\r\n[\"Private.\"]\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON, May 1, 1833.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR: * * * I have had a laborious task here, but Nullification\r\nis dead; and its actors and courtiers will only be remembered by the\r\nPeople to be execrated for their wicked designs to sever and destroy the\r\nonly good Government on the globe, and that prosperity and happiness we\r\nenjoy over every other portion of the World.  Haman's gallows ought to\r\nbe the fate of all such ambitious men who would involve their Country in\r\nCivil War, and all the evils in its train, that they might reign and\r\nride on its whirlwinds and direct the storm.  The Free People of these\r\nUnited States have spoken, and consigned these wicked demagogues to\r\ntheir proper doom.  Take care of your Nullifiers; you have them among\r\nyou; let them meet with the indignant frowns of every man who loves his\r\nCountry.  The Tariff, it is now known, was a mere pretext--its burden\r\nwas on your coarse woolens.  By the law of July, 1832, coarse woolen was\r\nreduced to five per cent., for the benefit of the South.  Mr. Clay's\r\nBill takes it up and classes it with woolens at fifty per cent., reduces\r\nit gradually down to twenty per cent., and there it is to remain, and\r\nMr. Calhoun and all the Nullifiers agree to the principle.  The cash\r\nduties and home valuation will be equal to fifteen per cent. more, and\r\nafter the year 1842, you pay on coarse woolens thirty-five per cent.  If\r\nthis is not Protection, I cannot understand; therefore the Tariff was\r\nonly the pretext, and Disunion and a Southern Confederacy the real\r\nobject.  The next pretext will be the Negro or Slavery question.\r\n\r\n\"My health is not good, but is improving a little.  Present me kindly to\r\nyour lady and family, and believe me to be your friend.  I will always\r\nbe happy to hear from you.\r\n                         \"ANDREW JACKSON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother evidence is given in the following extract from Benton's \"Thirty\r\nYears in the Senate,\" vol. ii., as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The regular inauguration of this Slavery agitation dates from the year\r\n1835; but it had commenced two years before, and in this way:\r\nNullification and Disunion had commenced in 1830, upon complaint against\r\nProtective Tariff.  That, being put down in 1833 under President\r\nJackson's proclamation and energetic measures, was immediately\r\nsubstituted by the Slavery agitation.  Mr. Calhoun, when he went home\r\nfrom Congress in the spring of that year, told his friends that 'the\r\nSouth could never be united against the North on the Tariff question\r\n--that the sugar interest of Louisiana would keep her out--and that the\r\nbasis of Southern Union must be shifted to the Slave question.'  Then\r\nall the papers in his interest, and especially the one at Washington,\r\npublished by Mr. Duff Green, dropped Tariff agitation, and commenced\r\nupon Slavery, and in two years had the agitation ripe for inauguration,\r\non the Slavery question.  And in tracing this agitation to its present\r\nstage, and to comprehend its rationale, it is not to be forgotten that\r\nit is a mere continuation of old Tariff Disunion, and preferred because\r\nmore available.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, from p. 490 of his private correspondence, Mr. Clay's words to an\r\nAlabamian, in 1844, are thus given:\r\n\r\n\"From the developments now being made in South Carolina, it is perfectly\r\nmanifest that a Party exists in that State seeking a Dissolution of the\r\nUnion, and for that purpose employ the pretext of the rejection of Mr.\r\nTyler's abominable treaty.  South Carolina, being surrounded by Slave\r\nStates, would, in the event of a Dissolution of the Union, suffer only\r\ncomparative evils; but it is otherwise with Kentucky.  She has the\r\nboundary of the Ohio extending four hundred miles on three Free States.\r\nWhat would our condition be in the event of the greatest calamity that\r\ncould befall this Nation?\"\r\n\r\nAllusion is also made to a letter written by Representative Nathan\r\nAppleton, of Boston, December 15, 1860, in which that gentleman said\r\nthat when he was in Congress--in 1832-33--he had \"made up his mind that\r\nMessrs. Calhoun, Hayne, McDuffie, etc., were desirous of a separation of\r\nthe Slave States into a separate Confederacy, as more favorable to the\r\nsecurity of Slave Property.\"\r\n\r\nAfter mentioning that \"About 1835, some South Carolinians attempted a\r\nDisunion demonstration,\" our authority says: It is thus described by\r\nex-Governor Francis Thomas of Maryland, in his speech in Baltimore,\r\nOctober 29, 1861:\r\n\r\n\"Full twenty years ago, when occupying my seat in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, I was surprised one morning, after the assembling of\r\nthe House, to observe that all the members from the Slaveholding States\r\nwere absent.  Whilst reflecting on this strange occurrence, I was asked\r\nwhy I was not in attendance on the Southern Caucus assembled in the room\r\nof the Committee on Claims.  I replied that I had received no\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\n\"I then proposed to go to the Committee-room to see what was being done.\r\nWhen I entered, I found that little cock-sparrow, Governor Pickens, of\r\nSouth Carolina, addressing the meeting, and strutting about like a\r\nrooster around a barn-yard coop, discussing the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"' Resolved, That no member of Congress, representing a Southern\r\nconstituency, shall again take his seat until a resolution is passed\r\nsatisfactory to the South on the subject of Slavery.'\r\n\r\n\"I listened to his language, and when he had finished, I obtained the\r\nfloor, asking to be permitted to take part in the discussion.  I\r\ndetermined at once to kill the Treasonable plot hatched by John C.\r\nCalhoun, the Catiline of America, by asking questions.  I said to Mr.\r\nPickens, 'What next do you propose we shall do? are we to tell the\r\nPeople that Republicanism is a failure?  If you are for that, I am not.\r\nI came here to sustain and uphold American institutions; to defend the\r\nrights of the North as well as the South; to secure harmony and good\r\nfellowship between all Sections of our common Country.' They dared not\r\nanswer these questions.  The Southern temper had not then been gotten\r\nup.  As my questions were not answered, I moved an adjournment of the\r\nCaucus /sine die/.  Mr. Craig, of Virginia, seconded the motion, and the\r\ncompany was broken up.  We returned to the House, and Mr. Ingersoll, of\r\nPennsylvania, a glorious patriot then as now, introduced a resolution\r\nwhich temporarily calmed the excitement.\"\r\n\r\nThe remarks upon this statement, made November 4, 1861, by the National\r\nIntelligencer, were as follows:\r\n\r\n\"However busy Mr. Pickens may have been in the Caucus after it met, the\r\nmost active man in getting it up and pressing the Southern members to go\r\ninto it, was Mr. R.  B. Rhett, also a member from South Carolina.  The\r\noccasion, or alleged cause of this withdrawal from the House into secret\r\ndeliberation was an anti-Slavery speech of Mr. Slade, of Vermont, which\r\nMr. Rhett violently denounced, and proposed to the Southern members to\r\nleave the House and go into Conclave in one of the Committee-rooms,\r\nwhich they generally did, if not all of them.  We are able to state,\r\nhowever, what may not have been known to Governor Thomas, that at least\r\nthree besides himself, of those who did attend it, went there with a\r\npurpose very different from an intention to consent to any Treasonable\r\nmeasure.  These three men were Henry A.  Wise, Balie Peyton, and William\r\nCost Johnson.  Neither of them opened his lips in the Caucus; they went\r\nto observe; and we can assure Governor Thomas, that if Mr. Pickens or\r\nMr. Calhoun, (whom he names) or any one else had presented a distinct\r\nproposition looking to Disunion, or Revolt, or Secession, he would have\r\nwitnessed a scene not soon to be forgotten.  The three whom we have\r\nmentioned were as brave as they were determined.  Fortunately, perhaps,\r\nthe man whom they went particularly to watch, remained silent and\r\npassive.\"\r\n\r\nLet us, however, pursue the inquiry a little further.  On the 14th of\r\nNovember, 1860, Alexander H. Stephens addressed the Legislature of\r\nGeorgia, and in a portion of that address--replying to a speech made\r\nbefore the same Body the previous evening by Mr. Toombs, in which the\r\nlatter had \"recounted the evils of this Government\"--said:\r\n\r\n\"The first [of these evils] was the Fishing Bounties, paid mostly to the\r\nsailors of New England.  Our friend stated that forty-eight years of our\r\nGovernment was under the administration of Southern Presidents.  Well,\r\nthese Fishing Bounties began under the rule of a Southern President, I\r\nbelieve.  No one of them, during the whole forty-eight years, ever set\r\nhis Administration against the principle or policy of them.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"The next evil which my friend complained of, was the Tariff.  Well, let\r\nus look at that for a moment.  About the time I commenced noticing\r\npublic matters, this question was agitating the Country almost as\r\nfearfully as the Slave question now is.  In 1832, when I was in college,\r\nSouth Carolina was ready to Nullify or Secede from the Union on this\r\naccount.  And what have we seen?  The Tariff no longer distracts the\r\npublic counsels.  Reason has triumphed!  The present Tariff was voted\r\nfor by Massachusetts and South Carolina.  The lion and the lamb lay down\r\ntogether--every man in the Senate and House from Massachusetts and South\r\nCarolina, I think, voted for it, as did my honorable friend himself.\r\nAnd if it be true, to use the figure of speech of my honorable friend,\r\nthat every man in the North that works in iron, and brass and wood, has\r\nhis muscle strengthened by the protection of the Government, that\r\nstimulant was given by his vote and I believe (that of) every other\r\nSouthern man.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. TOOMBS--The Tariff lessened the duties.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. STEPHENS--Yes, and Massachusetts with unanimity voted with the\r\nSouth to lessen them, and they were made just as low as Southern men\r\nasked them to be, and that is the rate they are now at.  If reason and\r\nargument, with experience, produced such changes in the sentiments of\r\nMassachusetts from 1832 to 1857, on the subject of the Tariff, may not\r\nlike changes be effected there by the same means--reason and argument,\r\nand appeals to patriotism on the present vexed question?  And who can\r\nsay that by 1875 or 1890, Massachusetts may not vote with South Carolina\r\nand Georgia upon all those questions that now distract the Country and\r\nthreaten its peace and existence.\r\n\r\n\"Another matter of grievance alluded to by my honorable friend was the\r\nNavigation Laws.  This policy was also commenced under the\r\nAdministration of one of these Southern Presidents who ruled so well,\r\nand has been continued through all of them since. * * * One of the\r\nobjects (of these) was to build up a commercial American marine by\r\ngiving American bottoms the exclusive Carrying Trade between our own\r\nports.  This is a great arm of national power.  This object was\r\naccomplished.  We have now an amount of shipping, not only coastwise,\r\nbut to foreign countries, which puts us in the front rank of the Nations\r\nof the World.  England can no longer be styled the Mistress of the Seas.\r\nWhat American is not proud of the result?  Whether those laws should be\r\ncontinued is another question.  But one thing is certain; no President,\r\nNorthern or Southern, has ever yet recommended their repeal. * * *\r\n\r\n\"These then were the true main grievances or grounds of complaint\r\nagainst the general system of our Government and its workings--I mean\r\nthe administration of the Federal Government.  As to the acts of the\r\nfederal States I shall speak presently: but these three were the main\r\nones used against the common head.  Now, suppose it be admitted that all\r\nof these are evils in the system; do they overbalance and outweigh the\r\nadvantages and great good which this same Government affords in a\r\nthousand innumerable ways that cannot be estimated?  Have we not at the\r\nSouth, as well as the North, grown great, prosperous, and happy under\r\nits operations?  Has any part of the World ever shown such rapid\r\nprogress in the development of wealth, and all the material resources of\r\nnational power and greatness, as the Southern States have under the\r\nGeneral Government, notwithstanding all its defects?\r\n\r\n\"Mr. TOOMBS--In spite of it.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. STEPHENS--My honorable friend says we have, in spite of the General\r\nGovernment; that without it, I suppose he thinks, we might have done as\r\nwell, or perhaps better, than we have done in spite of it.  * * *\r\nWhether we of the South would have been better off without the\r\nGovernment, is, to say the least, problematical.  On the one side we can\r\nonly put the fact, against speculation and conjecture on the other.  * *\r\n*  The influence of the Government on us is like that of the atmosphere\r\naround us.  Its benefits are so silent and unseen that they are seldom\r\nthought of or appreciated.\r\n\r\n\"We seldom think of the single element of oxygen in the air we breathe,\r\nand yet let this simple, unseen and unfelt agent be withdrawn, this\r\nlife-giving element be taken away from this all-pervading fluid around\r\nus, and what instant and appalling changes would take place in all\r\norganic creation.\r\n\r\n\"It may be that we are all that we are 'in spite of the General\r\nGovernment,' but it may be that without it we should have been far\r\ndifferent from what we are now.  It is true that there is no equal part\r\nof the Earth with natural resources superior perhaps to ours.  That\r\nportion of this Country known as the Southern States, stretching from\r\nthe Chesapeake to the Rio Grande, is fully equal to the picture drawn by\r\nthe honorable and eloquent Senator last night, in all natural\r\ncapacities.  But how many ages and centuries passed before these\r\ncapacities were developed to reach this advanced age of civilization.\r\nThere these same hills, rich in ore, same rivers, same valleys and\r\nplains, are as they have been since they came from the hand of the\r\nCreator; uneducated and uncivilized man roamed over them for how long no\r\nhistory informs us.\r\n\r\n\"It was only under our institutions that they could be developed.  Their\r\ndevelopment is the result of the enterprise of our people, under\r\noperations of the Government and institutions under which we have lived.\r\nEven our people, without these, never would have done it.  The\r\norganization of society has much to do with the development of the\r\nnatural resources of any Country or any Land.  The institutions of a\r\nPeople, political and moral, are the matrix in which the germ of their\r\norganic structure quickens into life--takes root, and develops in form,\r\nnature, and character.  Our institutions constitute the basis, the\r\nmatrix, from which spring all our characteristics of development and\r\ngreatness.  Look at Greece.  There is the same fertile soil, the same\r\nblue sky, the same inlets and harbors, the same AEgean, the same\r\nOlympus; there is the same land where Homer sung, where Pericles spoke;\r\nit is in nature the same old Greece--but it is living Greece no more.\r\n\r\n\"Descendants of the same people inhabit the country; yet what is the\r\nreason of this vast difference?  In the midst of present degradation we\r\nsee the glorious fragments of ancient works of art-temples, with\r\nornaments and inscriptions that excite wonder and admiration--the\r\nremains of a once high order of civilization, which have outlived the\r\nlanguage they spoke--upon them all, Ichabod is written--their glory has\r\ndeparted.  Why is this so?  I answer, their institutions have been\r\ndestroyed.  These were but the fruits of their forms of government, the\r\nmatrix from which their great development sprang; and when once the\r\ninstitutions of a People have been destroyed, there is no earthly power\r\nthat can bring back the Promethean spark to kindle them here again, any\r\nmore than in that ancient land of eloquence, poetry and song.\r\n\r\n\"The same may be said of Italy.  Where is Rome, once the mistress of the\r\nWorld?  There are the same seven hills now, the same soil, the same\r\nnatural resources; the nature is the same, but what a ruin of human\r\ngreatness meets the eye of the traveler throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of that most down-trodden land! why have not the People of that\r\nHeaven-favored clime, the spirit that animated their fathers?  Why this\r\nsad difference?\r\n\r\n\"It is the destruction of their institutions that has caused it; and, my\r\ncountrymen, if we shall in an evil hour rashly pull down and destroy\r\nthose institutions which the patriotic hand of our fathers labored so\r\nlong and so hard to build up, and which have done so much for us and the\r\nWorld, who can venture the prediction that similar results will not\r\nensue?  Let us avoid it if we can.  I trust the spirit is among us that\r\nwill enable us to do it.  Let us not rashly try the experiment, for, if\r\nit fails, as it did in Greece and Italy, and in the South American\r\nRepublics, and in every other place wherever liberty is once destroyed,\r\nit may never be restored to us again.\r\n\r\n\"There are defects in our government, errors in administration, and\r\nshort-comings of many kinds; but in spite of these defects and errors,\r\nGeorgia has grown to be a great State.  Let us pause here a moment.\r\n\r\n\"When I look around and see our prosperity in everything, agriculture,\r\ncommerce, art, science, and every department of education, physical and\r\nmental, as well as moral advancement--and our colleges--I think, in the\r\nface of such an exhibition, if we can, without the loss of power, or any\r\nessential right or interest, remain in the Union, it is our duty to\r\nourselves and to posterity--let us not too readily yield to this\r\ntemptation--to do so.  Our first parents, the great progenitors of the\r\nhuman race, were not without a like temptation, when in the Garden of\r\nEden.  They were led to believe that their condition would be bettered\r\n--that their eyes would be opened--and that they would become as gods.\r\nThey in an evil hour yielded--instead of becoming gods they only saw\r\ntheir own nakedness.\r\n\r\n\"I look upon this Country, with our institutions, as the Eden of the\r\nWorld, the Paradise of the Universe.  It may be that out of it we may\r\nbecome greater and more prosperous, but I am candid and sincere in\r\ntelling you that I fear if we rashly evince passion, and without\r\nsufficient cause shall take that step, that instead of becoming greater\r\nor more peaceful, prosperous, and happy--instead of becoming gods, we\r\nwill become demons, and at no distant day commence cutting one another's\r\nthroats.  This is my apprehension.\r\n\r\n\"Let us, therefore, whatever we do, meet those difficulties, great as\r\nthey are, like wise and sensible men, and consider them in the light of\r\nall the consequences which may attend our action.  Let us see first\r\nclearly where the path of duty leads, and then we may not fear to tread\r\ntherein.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSaid Senator Wigfall, of Texas, March 4, 1861, in the United States\r\nSenate, only a few hours before Mr. Lincoln's Inauguration:\r\n\r\n\"I desire to pour oil on the waters, to produce harmony, peace and quiet\r\nhere.  It is early in the morning, and I hope I shall not say anything\r\nthat may be construed as offensive.  I rise merely that we may have an\r\nunderstanding of this question.\r\n\r\n\"It is not Slavery in the Territories, it is not expansion, which is the\r\ndifficulty.  If the resolution which the Senator from Wisconsin\r\nintroduced here, denying the right of Secession, had been adopted by\r\ntwo-thirds of each branch of this department of the Government, and had\r\nbeen ratified by three-fourths of the States, I have no hesitation in\r\nsaying that, so far as the State in which I live and to which I owe my\r\nallegiance is concerned, if she had no other cause for a disruption of\r\nthe Union taking place, she would undoubtedly have gone out.\r\n\r\n     [To insert as an additional article of amendment to the\r\n     Constitution, the following: \"Under this Constitution, as\r\n     originally adopted, and as it now exists, no State has power to\r\n     withdraw from the jurisdiction of the United States: but this\r\n     Constitution, and all laws passed in pursuance of its delegated\r\n     powers, are the Supreme Law of the Land, anything contained in any\r\n     constitution, ordinance, or act of any State, to the contrary\r\n     notwithstanding.\"]\r\n\r\n\"The moment you deny the right of self-government to the free White men\r\nof the South, they will leave the Government.  They believe in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.  They believe that:\r\n\r\n\"'Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from\r\nthe consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of government\r\nbecomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the People to\r\nalter or to abolish it, and to institute a new Government, laying its\r\nfoundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as\r\nto them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.'\r\n\r\n\"That principle of the Declaration of Independence is the one upon which\r\nthe free White men of the South predicated their devotion to the present\r\nConstitution of the United States; and it was the denial of that, as\r\nmuch as anything else, that has created the dissatisfaction in that\r\nSection of the Country.\r\n\r\n\"There is no instrument of writing that has ever been written that has\r\nbeen more misapprehended and misunderstood and misrepresented than this\r\nsame unfortunate Declaration of Independence, and no set of gentlemen\r\nhave ever been so slandered as the fathers who drew and signed that\r\nDeclaration.\r\n\r\n\"If there was a thing on earth that they did not intend to assert, it\r\nwas that a Negro was a White man.  As I said here, a short time ago, one\r\nof the greatest charges they made against the British Government was,\r\nthat old King George was attempting to establish the fact practically\r\nthat all men were created Free and Equal.  They charged him in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence with inciting their Slaves to insurrection.\r\nThat is one of the grounds upon which they threw off their allegiance to\r\nthe British Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"Another great misapprehension is, that the men who drafted that\r\nDeclaration of Independence had any peculiar fancy for one form of\r\ngovernment rather than another.  They were not fighting to establish a\r\nDemocracy in this country; they were not fighting to establish a\r\nRepublican form of government in this Country.  Nothing was further from\r\ntheir intention.\r\n\r\n\"Alexander Hamilton, after he had fought for seven years, declared that\r\nthe British form of government was the best that the ingenuity of man\r\nhad ever devised; and when John Adams said to him, 'without its\r\ncorruptions;'  'Why,' said he, 'its corruptions are its greatest\r\nexcellence; without the corruptions, it would be nothing.'\r\n\r\n\"In the Declaration of Independence, they speak of George III., after\r\nthis fashion.  They say:\r\n\r\n\"'A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define\r\na tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free People.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, I ask any plain common-sense man what was the meaning of that?\r\nWas it that they were opposed to a Monarchical form of government?  Was\r\nit that they believed a Monarchical form of government was incompatible\r\nwith civil liberty?  No, sir; they entertained no such absurd idea.\r\nNone of them entertained it; but they say that George III, was a prince\r\nwhose character was 'marked by every act which may define a tyrant' and\r\nthat therefore he was 'unfit to be the ruler of a free People.'  Had his\r\ncharacter not been so marked by every quality which would define a\r\ntyrant, he might have been the fit ruler of a free People; ergo, a\r\nmonarchical form of Government was not incompatible with civil liberty.\r\n\r\n\"That was clearly the opinion of those men.  I do not advocate it now;\r\nfor I have said frequently that we are wiser than our fathers, and our\r\nchildren will be wiser than we are.  One hundred years hence, men will\r\nunderstand their own affairs much better than we do.  We understand our\r\naffairs better than those who preceded us one hundred years.  But what I\r\nassert is, that the men of the Revolution did not believe that a\r\nMonarchical form of Government was incompatible with civil liberty.\r\n\r\n\"What I assert is, that when they spoke of 'all men being created\r\nequal,' they were speaking of the White men who then had unsheathed\r\ntheir swords--for what purpose?  To establish the right of\r\nself-government in themselves; and when they had achieved that, they\r\nestablished, not Democracies, but Republican forms of Government in\r\nthe thirteen sovereign, separate and independent Colonies.  Yet the\r\nDeclaration of Independence is constantly quoted to prove Negro\r\nequality.  It proves no such thing; it was intended to prove no such\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\"The 'glittering generalities' which a distinguished former Senator from\r\nMassachusetts (Mr. Choate) spoke of, as contained in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, one of them at least, about all men being created equal\r\n--was not original with Mr. Jefferson.  I recollect seeing a pamphlet\r\ncalled the Principles of the Whigs and Jacobites, published about the\r\nyear 1745, when the last of the Stuarts, called 'the Pretender,' was\r\nstriking a blow that was fatal to himself, but a blow for his crown, in\r\nwhich pamphlet the very phraseology is used, word for word and letter\r\nfor letter.  I have not got it here to-night.  I sent the other day to\r\nthe Library to try and find it, but could not find it; it was burnt, I\r\nbelieve, with the pamphlets that were burnt some time ago.\r\n\r\n\"That Mr. Jefferson copied it or plagiarized it, is not true, I suppose,\r\nany more than the charge that the distinguished Senator from New York\r\nplagiarized from the Federalist in preparing his celebrated compromising\r\nspeech which was made here a short time ago.  It was the cant phrase of\r\nthe day in 1745, which was only about thirty years previous to the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.  This particular pamphlet, which I have\r\nread, was published; others were published at the same time.  That sort\r\nof phraseology was used.\r\n\r\n\"There was a war of classes in England; there were men who were\r\ncontending for legitimacy; who were contending for the right of the\r\nCrown being inherent and depending on the will of God, 'the divine right\r\nof Kings,' for maintaining an hereditary landed-aristocracy; there was\r\nanother Party who were contending against this doctrine of legitimacy,\r\nand the right of primogeniture.  These were called the Whigs; they\r\nestablished this general phraseology in denouncing the divine right and\r\nthe doctrine of legitimacy, and it became the common phraseology of the\r\nCountry; so that in the obscure county of Mecklenburg, in North\r\nCarolina, a declaration containing the same assertions was found as in\r\nthis celebrated Declaration of Independence, written by the immortal\r\nJefferson.\r\n\r\n\"Which of us, I ask, is there upon this floor who has not read and\r\nre-read whatever was written within the last twenty-five or thirty years\r\nby the distinguished men of this country?  But enough of that.\r\n\r\n\"As I said before, there ought not have been, and there did not\r\nnecessarily result from our form of Government, any irrepressible\r\nconflict between the Slaveholding and the non-Slaveholding States.\r\nNothing of the sort was necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Strike out a single clause in the Constitution of the United States,\r\nthat which secures to each State a Republican form of Government, and\r\nthere is no reason why, under precisely such a Constitution as we have,\r\nStates that are Monarchical and States that are Republican, could not\r\nlive in peace and quiet.  They confederate together for common defense\r\nand general welfare, each State regulating its domestic concerns in its\r\nown way; those which preferred a Republican form of Government\r\nmaintaining it, and those which preferred a Monarchical form of\r\nGovernment maintaining it.\r\n\r\n\"But how long could small States, with different forms of Government,\r\nlive together, confederated for common defense and general welfare, if\r\nthe people of one Section were to come to the conclusion that their\r\ninstitutions were better than those of the other, and thereupon\r\nstraightway set about subverting the institutions of the other?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the reply of the Rebel \"Commissioners of the Southern Confederacy\"\r\nto Mr. Seward, April 9, 1861, they speak of our Government as being\r\n\"persistently wedded to those fatal theories of construction of the\r\nFederal Constitution always rejected by the statesmen of the South, and\r\nadhered to by those of the Administration school, until they have\r\nproduced their natural and often-predicted result of the destruction of\r\nthe Union, under which we might have continued to live happily and\r\ngloriously together, had the spirit of the ancestry who framed the\r\ncommon Constitution animated the hearts of all their sons.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Address of the people of South Carolina, assembled in\r\nConvention, to the people of the Slaveholding States of the United\r\nStates,\" by which the attempt was made to justify the passage of the\r\nSouth Carolina Secession Ordinance of 1860, it is declared that:\r\n\r\n\"Discontent and contention have moved in the bosom of the Confederacy,\r\nfor the last thirty-five years.  During this time South Carolina has\r\ntwice called her people together in solemn Convention, to take into\r\nconsideration, the aggressions and unconstitutional wrongs, perpetrated\r\nby the people of the North on the people of the South.  These wrongs\r\nwere submitted to by the people of the South, under the hope and\r\nexpectation that they would be final.  But such hope and expectation\r\nhave proved to be vain.  Instead of producing forbearance, our\r\nacquiescence has only instigated to new forms of aggressions and\r\noutrage; and South Carolina, having again assembled her people in\r\nConvention, has this day dissolved her connection with the States\r\nconstituting the United States.\r\n\r\n\"The one great evil from which all other evils have flowed, is the\r\noverthrow of the Constitution of the United States.  The Government of\r\nthe United States, is no longer the Government of Confederated\r\nRepublics, but of a consolidated Democracy.  It is no longer a free\r\nGovernment, but a Despotism.  It is, in fact, such a Government as Great\r\nBritain attempted to set over our Fathers; and which was resisted and\r\ndefeated by a seven years struggle for Independence.\r\n\r\n\"The Revolution of 1776, turned upon one great principle,\r\nself-government,--and self-taxation, the criterion of self-government.\r\n\r\n\"The Southern States now stand exactly in the same position towards the\r\nNorthern States, that the Colonies did towards Great Britain.  The\r\nNorthern States, having the majority in Congress, claim the same power\r\nof omnipotence in legislation as the British Parliament.  'The General\r\nWelfare' is the only limit to the legislation of either; and the\r\nmajority in Congress, as in the British Parliament, are the sole judges\r\nof the expediency of the legislation this 'General Welfare' requires.\r\nThus the Government of the United States has become a consolidated\r\nGovernment; and the people of the Southern States are compelled to meet\r\nthe very despotism their fathers threw off in the Revolution of 1776.\r\n\r\n\"The consolidation of the Government of Great Britain over the Colonies,\r\nwas attempted to be carried out by the taxes.  The British Parliament\r\nundertook to tax the Colonies to promote British interests.  Our fathers\r\nresisted this pretension.  They claimed the right of self-taxation\r\nthrough their Colonial Legislatures.  They were not represented in the\r\nBritish Parliament, and, therefore, could not rightly be taxed by its\r\nlegislation.  The British Government, however, offered them a\r\nrepresentation in Parliament; but it was not sufficient to enable them\r\nto protect themselves from the majority, and they refused the offer.\r\nBetween taxation without any representation, and taxation without a\r\nrepresentation adequate to protection, there was no difference.  In\r\nneither case would the Colonies tax themselves.  Hence, they refused to\r\npay the taxes laid by the British Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"And so with the Southern States, towards the Northern States, in the\r\nvital matter of taxation.  They are in a minority in Congress.  Their\r\nrepresentation in Congress is useless to protect them against unjust\r\ntaxation; and they are taxed by the people of the North for their\r\nbenefit, exactly as the people of Great Britain taxed our ancestors in\r\nthe British Parliament for their benefit.  For the last forty years, the\r\ntaxes laid by the Congress of the United States have been laid with a\r\nview of subserving the interests of the North.  The people of the South\r\nhave been taxed by duties on imports, not for revenue, but for an object\r\ninconsistent with revenue--to promote, by prohibitions, Northern\r\ninterests in the productions of their mines and manufactures.\r\n\r\n\"There is another evil, in the condition of the Southern towards the\r\nNorthern States, which our ancestors refused to bear towards Great\r\nBritain.  Our ancestors not only taxed themselves, but all the taxes\r\ncollected from them were expended amongst them.  Had they submitted to\r\nthe pretensions of the British Government, the taxes collected from\r\nthem, would have been expended in other parts of the British Empire.\r\nThey were fully aware of the effect of such a policy in impoverishing\r\nthe people from whom taxes are collected, and in enriching those who\r\nreceive the benefit of their expenditure.\r\n\r\n\"To prevent the evils of such a policy, was one of the motives which\r\ndrove them on to Revolution, yet this British policy has been fully\r\nrealized towards the Southern States, by the Northern States.  The\r\npeople of the Southern States are not only taxed for the benefit of the\r\nNorthern States, but after the taxes are collected, three fourths of\r\nthem are expended at the North.  This cause, with others, connected with\r\nthe operation of the General Government, has made the cities of the\r\nSouth provincial.  Their growth is paralyzed; they are mere suburbs of\r\nNorthern cities.  The agricultural productions of the South are the\r\nbasis of the foreign commerce of the United States; yet Southern cities\r\ndo not carry it on.  Our foreign trade is almost annihilated.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"No man can for a moment believe, that our ancestors intended to\r\nestablish over their posterity, exactly the same sort of Government they\r\nhad overthrown.  * * *  Yet by gradual and steady encroachments on the\r\npart of the people of the North, and acquiescence on the part of the\r\nSouth, the limitations in the Constitution have been swept away; and the\r\nGovernment of the United States has become consolidated, with a claim of\r\nlimitless powers in its operations.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"A majority in Congress, according to their interested and perverted\r\nviews, is omnipotent.  * * *  Numbers with them, is the great element of\r\nfree Government.  A majority is infallible and omnipotent.  'The right\r\ndivine to rule in Kings,' is only transferred to their majority.  The\r\nvery object of all Constitutions, in free popular Government, is to\r\nrestrain the majority.  Constitutions, therefore, according to their\r\ntheory, must be most unrighteous inventions, restricting liberty.  None\r\nought to exist; but the body politic ought simply to have a political\r\norganization, to bring out and enforce the will of the majority.  This\r\ntheory is a remorseless despotism.  In resisting it, as applicable to\r\nourselves, we are vindicating the great cause of free Government, more\r\nimportant, perhaps, to the World, than the existence of all the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his Special Message to the Confederate Congress at Montgomery, April\r\n29, 1861, Mr. Jefferson Davis said:\r\n\r\n\"From a period as early as 1798, there had existed in all the States a\r\nParty, almost uninterruptedly in the majority, based upon the creed that\r\neach State was, in the last resort, the sole judge, as well of its\r\nwrongs as of the mode and measure of redress.  * * *  The Democratic\r\nParty of the United States repeated, in its successful canvas of 1836,\r\nthe declaration, made in numerous previous political contests, that it\r\nwould faithfully abide by and uphold the principles laid down in the\r\nKentucky and Virginia Legislatures of [1798 and] 1799, and that it\r\nadopts those principles as constituting one of the main foundations of\r\nits political creed.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed by the Rebel Commissioners in London (Yancey, Rost\r\nand Mann), August 14, 1861, to Lord John Russell, Secretary of Foreign\r\nAffairs, it appears that they said: \"It was from no fear that the Slaves\r\nwould be liberated, that Secession took place.  The very Party in power\r\nhas proposed to guarantee Slavery forever in the States, if the South\r\nwould but remain in the Union.\"  On the 4th of May preceding, Lord John\r\nhad received these Commissioners at his house; and in a letter of\r\nMay 11, 1861, wrote, from the Foreign Office, to Lord Lyons, the British\r\nMinister at Washington, a letter, in which, alluding to his informal\r\ncommunication with them, he said: \"One of these gentlemen, speaking for\r\nthe others, dilated on the causes which had induced the Southern States\r\nto Secede from the Northern.  The principal of these causes, he said,\r\nwas not Slavery, but the very high price which, for the sake of\r\nProtecting the Northern manufacturers, the South were obliged to pay for\r\nthe manufactured goods which they required.  One of the first acts of\r\nthe Southern Congress was to reduce these duties, and to prove their\r\nsincerity he gave as an instance that Louisiana had given up altogether\r\nthat Protection on her sugar which she enjoyed by the legislation of the\r\nUnited States.  As a proof of the riches of the South.  He stated that\r\nof $350,000,000 of exports of produce to foreign countries $270,000,000\r\nwere furnished by the Southern States.\"  * * *  They pointed to the new\r\nTariff of the United States as a proof that British manufactures would\r\nbe nearly excluded from the North, and freely admitted in the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis may be as good a place as any other to say a few words touching\r\nanother alleged \"cause\" of Secession.  During the exciting period just\r\nprior to the breaking out of the great War of the Rebellion, the\r\nSlave-holding and Secession-nursing States of the South, made a terrible\r\nhubbub over the Personal Liberty Bills of the Northern States.  And when\r\nSecession came, many people of the North supposed these Bills to be the\r\nprime, if not the only real cause of it.  Not so.  They constituted, as\r\nwe now know, only a part of the mere pretext.  But, none the less, they\r\nconstituted a portion of the history of that eventful time, and cannot\r\nbe altogether ignored.\r\n\r\nIn order then, that the reader may quickly grasp, not only the general\r\nnature, but also the most important details of the Personal Liberty\r\nBills (in force, in 1860, in many of the Free States) so frequently\r\nalluded to in the Debates of Congress, in speeches on the stump, and in\r\nthe fulminations of Seceding States and their authorized agents,\r\ncommissioners, and representatives, it may be well now, briefly to refer\r\nto them, and to state that no such laws existed in California, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, Ohio and Oregon.\r\n\r\nThose of Maine provided that no officer of the State should in any way\r\nassist in the arrest or detention of a Fugitive Slave, and made it the\r\nduty of county attorneys to defend the Fugitive Slave against the claim\r\nof his master.  A Bill to repeal these laws passed the Maine Senate, but\r\nfailed in the House.\r\n\r\nThat of Massachusetts provided for commissioners in each county to\r\ndefend alleged Fugitives from Service or Labor; for payment by the\r\nCommonwealth of all expenses of defense; prohibited the issue or service\r\nof process by State officers for arrest of alleged Fugitives, or the use\r\nof any prisons in the State for their detention, or that of any person\r\naiding their escape; prohibited the kidnapping or removal of alleged\r\nFugitive Slaves by any person; prohibited all officers within the State,\r\ndown to Town officers, from arresting, imprisoning, detaining or\r\nreturning to Service \"any Person for the reason that he is claimed or\r\nadjudged to be a Fugitive from Service or Labor\"--all such prohibitions\r\nbeing enforced by heavy fines and imprisonment.  The Act of March 25,\r\n1861, materially modified and softened the above provisions.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire's law, provided that all Slaves entering the State with\r\nconsent of the master shall be Free, and made the attempt to hold any\r\nperson as a Slave within the State a felony.\r\n\r\nVermont's, prescribed that no process under the Fugitive Slave Law\r\nshould be recognized by any of her Courts, officers, or citizens; nor\r\nany aid given in arresting or removing from the State any Person claimed\r\nas a Fugitive Slave; provided counsel for alleged Fugitives; for the\r\nissue of habeas corpus and trial by jury of issues of fact between the\r\nparties; ordained Freedom to all within the State who may have been held\r\nas Slaves before coming into it, and prescribed heavy penalties for any\r\nattempt to return any such to Slavery.  A bill to repeal these laws,\r\nproposed November, 1860, in the Vermont House of Representatives, was\r\nbeaten by two to one.\r\n\r\nConnecticut's, provided that there must be two witnesses to prove that a\r\nPerson is a Slave; that depositions are not evidence; that false\r\ntestifying in Fugitive Slave cases shall be punishable by fine of $5,000\r\nand five years in State prison.\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey, the only laws touching the subject, permitted persons\r\ntemporarily sojourning in the State to bring and hold their Slaves, and\r\nmade it the duty of all State officers to aid in the recovery of\r\nFugitives from Service.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania, barring an old dead-letter Statute, they simply\r\nprohibited any interference by any of the Courts, Aldermen, or Justices\r\nof the Peace, of the Commonwealth, with the functions of the\r\nCommissioner appointed under the United States Statute in Fugitive Slave\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan, the law required States' attorneys to defend Fugitive\r\nSlaves; prescribed the privileges of habeas corpus and jury trial for\r\nall such arrested; prohibited the use of prisons of the State for their\r\ndetention; required evidence of two credible witnesses as to identity;\r\nand provided heavy penalties of fine and imprisonment for the seizure of\r\nany Free Person, with intent to have such Person held in Slavery.  A\r\nBill to repeal the Michigan law was defeated in the House by about two\r\nto one.\r\n\r\nWisconsin's Personal Liberty law was similar to that of Michigan, but\r\nwith this addition, that no judgment recovered against any person in\r\nthat State for violating the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 should be\r\nenforced by sale or execution of any real or personal property in that\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThat of Rhode Island, forbade the carrying away of any Person by force\r\nout of the State; forbade the official aiding in the arrest or detention\r\nof a Fugitive Slave; and denied her jails to the United States for any\r\nsuch detention.\r\n\r\nApropos of this subject, and before leaving it, it may be well to quote\r\nremarks of Mr. Simons of Rhode Island, in the United States Senate.\r\nSaid he: \"Complaint has been made of Personal Liberty Bills.  Now, the\r\nMassachusetts Personal Liberty Bill was passed by a Democratic House, a\r\nDemocratic Senate, and signed by a Democratic Governor, a man who was\r\nafterwards nominated by Mr. Polk for the very best office in New\r\nEngland, and was unanimously confirmed by a Democratic United States\r\nSenate.  Further than this, the very first time the attention of the\r\nMassachusetts Legislature was called to the propriety of a repeal of\r\nthis law was by a Republican Governor.  Now, on the other hand, South\r\nCarolina had repealed a law imprisoning British colored sailors, but\r\nretained the one imprisoning those coming from States inhabited by her\r\nown brethren!\"\r\n\r\nThese Personal Liberty Bills were undoubtedly largely responsible for\r\nsome of the irritation on the Slavery question preceding open\r\nhostilities between the Sections.  But President Lincoln sounded the\r\nreal depths of the Rebellion when he declared it to be a War upon the\r\nrights of the People.  In his First Annual Message, December 3, 1861, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not\r\nexclusively, a War upon the first principle of popular government--the\r\nrights of the People.  Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most\r\ngrave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the\r\ngeneral tone of the insurgents.  In those documents we find the\r\nabridgment of the existing right of suffrage, and the denial to the\r\nPeople of all right to participate in the selection of public officers,\r\nexcept the legislative, boldly advocated, with labored arguments to\r\nprove that large control of the People in government is the source of\r\nall political evil.  Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a\r\npossible refuge from the power of the People.\r\n\r\n\"In my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to omit\r\nraising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism.\r\n\r\n\"It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a general argument should be\r\nmade in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point, with its\r\nconnections, not so hackneyed as most others, to which I ask brief\r\nattention.  It is the effort to place Capital on an equal footing with,\r\nif not above Labor, in the structure of the Government.\r\n\r\n\"It is assumed that Labor is available only in connection with Capital;\r\nthat nobody labors unless somebody else, owning Capital, somehow by the\r\nuse of it induces him to labor.  This assumed, it is next considered\r\nwhether it is best that Capital shall hire laborers, and thus induce\r\nthem to work by their own consent, or buy them, and drive them to it\r\nwithout their consent.  Having proceeded so far, it is naturally\r\nconcluded that all laborers are either hired laborers, or what we call\r\nSlaves.  And further, it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer\r\nis fixed in that condition for life.\r\n\r\n\"Now, there is no such relation between Capital and Labor as assumed;\r\nnor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life, in the\r\ncondition of a hired laborer.  Both these assumptions are false, and all\r\ninferences from them are groundless.\r\n\r\n\"Labor is prior to, and independent of Capital.  Capital is only the\r\nfruit of Labor, and could never have existed if Labor had not first\r\nexisted.  Labor is the superior of Capital, and deserves much the higher\r\nconsideration.  Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of\r\nprotection as any other rights.  Nor is it denied that there is, and\r\nprobably always will be, a relation between Labor and Capital, producing\r\nmutual benefits.  The error is in assuming that the whole Labor of the\r\ncommunity exists within that relation.\r\n\r\n\"A few men own Capital, and that few, avoid labor themselves, and with\r\ntheir Capital hire or buy another few to labor for them.  A large\r\nmajority belong to neither class--neither work for others, nor have\r\nothers working for them.\r\n\r\n\"In most of the Southern States, a majority of the whole people of all\r\ncolors are neither Slaves nor masters; while in the Northern, a large\r\nmajority are neither hirers nor hired.  Men with their families--wives,\r\nsons, and daughters--work for themselves, on their farms, in their\r\nhouses, and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and\r\nasking no favors of Capital on the one hand, nor of hired laborers or\r\nSlaves on the other.\r\n\r\n\"It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingle their\r\nown Labor with Capital--that is they labor with their own hands, and\r\nalso buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed, and\r\nnot a distinct class.  No principle stated is disturbed by the existence\r\nof this mixed class.\r\n\r\n\"Again, as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such\r\nthing as the free hired-laborer being fixed to that condition for life.\r\nMany independent men everywhere in these States, a few years back in\r\ntheir lives, were hired laborers.\r\n\r\n\"The prudent, penniless beginner in the World, labors for wages awhile,\r\nsaves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors\r\non his own account another while, and at length hires another new\r\nbeginner to help him.  This is the just and generous and prosperous\r\nsystem, which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and consequent\r\nenergy and progress, and improvement of condition to all.\r\n\r\n\"No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from\r\npoverty--none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not\r\nhonestly earned.  Let them beware of surrendering a political power\r\nwhich they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be\r\nused to close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix\r\nnew disabilities and burdens upon them, till all of Liberty shall be\r\nlost.  * * *  The struggle of to-day is not altogether for to-day-it is\r\na vast future also.  * * * \"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo too, Andrew Johnson, in his speech before the Senate, January 31,\r\n1862, spake well and truly when he said that \"there has been a\r\ndeliberate design for years to change the nature and character and\r\ngenius of this Government.\"  And he added: \"Do we not know that these\r\nschemers have been deliberately at work, and that there is a Party in\r\nthe South, with some associates in the North, and even in the West, that\r\nhave become tired of Free Government, in which they have lost\r\nconfidence.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"They raise an outcry against 'Coercion,' that they may\r\nparalyze the Government, cripple the exercise of the great powers with\r\nwhich it was invested, finally to change its form and subject us to a\r\nSouthern despotism.  Do we not know it to be so?  Why disguise this\r\ngreat truth?  Do we not know that they have been anxious for a change of\r\nGovernment for years?  Since this Rebellion commenced it has manifested\r\nitself in many quarters.\r\n\r\n\"How long is it since the organ of the Government at Richmond, the\r\nRichmond Whig, declared that rather than live under the Government of\r\nthe United States, they preferred to take the Constitutional Queen of\r\nGreat Britain as their protector; that they would make an alliance with\r\nGreat Britain for the purpose of preventing the enforcement of the Laws\r\nof the United States.  Do we not know this?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen A. Douglas also, in his great Union speech at Chicago, May 1,\r\n1861--only a few days before his lamented death-said:\r\n\r\n\"The election of Mr. Lincoln is a mere pretext.  The present Secession\r\nmovement is the result of an enormous Conspiracy formed more than a year\r\nsince formed by leaders in the Southern Confederacy more than twelve\r\nmonths ago.  They use the Slavery question as a means to aid the\r\naccomplishment of their ends.  They desired the election of a Northern\r\ncandidate by a Sectional vote, in order to show that the two Sections\r\ncannot live together.\r\n\r\n\"When the history of the two years from the Lecompton question down to\r\nthe Presidential election shall be written, it will be shown that the\r\nscheme was deliberately made to break up this Union.\r\n\r\n\"They desired a Northern Republican to be elected by a purely Northern\r\nvote, and then assign this fact as a reason why the Sections cannot live\r\ntogether.  If the Disunion candidate--(Breckinridge) in the late\r\nPresidential contest had carried the united South, their scheme was, the\r\nNorthern candidate successful, to seize the Capital last Spring, and by\r\na united South and divided North, hold it.\r\n\r\n\"Their scheme was defeated, in the defeat of the Disunion candidates in\r\nseveral of the Southern States.\r\n\r\n\"But this is no time for a detail of causes.  The Conspiracy is now\r\nknown; Armies have been raised.  War is levied to accomplish it.  There\r\nare only two sides to the question.\r\n\r\n\"Every man must be for the United States, or against it.  There can be\r\nno Neutrals in this War; only Patriots or Traitors!  [Cheer after\r\nCheer].\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a speech made in the United States Senate, January 31, 1862, Senator\r\nMcDougall of California--conceded to be intellectually the peer of any\r\nman in that Body--said:\r\n\r\n\"We are at War.  How long have we been at War?  We have been engaged in\r\na war of opinion, according to my historical recollection, since 1838.\r\nThere has been a Systematic organized war against the Institutions\r\nestablished by our fathers, since 1832.  This is known of all men who\r\nhave read carefully the history of our Country.  If I had the leisure,\r\nor had consulted the authorities, I would give it year by year, and date\r\nby date, from that time until the present, how men adversary to our\r\nRepublican Institutions have been organizing War against us, because\r\nthey did not approve of our Republican Institutions.\r\n\r\n\"Before the Mexican War, it is well known that General Quitman, then\r\nGovernor of Mississippi, was organizing to produce the same condition of\r\nthings (and he hoped a better condition of things, for he hoped a\r\nsuccessful Secession), to produce this same revolution that is now\r\ndisturbing our whole Land.  The War with Mexico, fighting for a Southern\r\nproposition, for which I fought myself, made the Nation a unit until\r\n1849; and then again they undertook an Organization to produce\r\nRevolution.  These things are history.  This statement is true, and\r\ncannot be denied among intelligent men anywhere, and cannot be denied in\r\nthis Senate.\r\n\r\n\"The great men who sat in Council in this Hall, the great men of the\r\nNation, men whose equals are not, and I fear will not be for many years,\r\nuniting their judgments, settled the controversy in 1850.  They did not\r\nsettle it for the Conspirators of the South, for they were not parties\r\nto the compact.  Clay and Webster, and the great men who united with\r\nthem, had no relation with the extremes of either extreme faction.  The\r\nCompromise was made, and immediately after it had been effected, again\r\ncommenced the work of organization.  I had the honor to come from my\r\nState on the Pacific into the other branch of the Federal Congress, and\r\nthere I learned as early as 1853, that the work of Treason was as\r\nindustriously pursued as it is being pursued to-day.  I saw it; I felt\r\nit; I knew it.  I went home to the shores of the Pacific instructed\r\nsomewhat on this subject.\r\n\r\n\"Years passed by.  I engaged in my duties as a simple professional man,\r\nnot connected with public affairs.  The question of the last\r\nPresidential election arose before the Country--one of those great\r\nquestions that are not appreciated, I regret from my heart, by the\r\nAmerican Nation, when we elect a President, a man who has more power for\r\nhis time than any enthroned Monarch in Europe.  We organize a Government\r\nand place him in front as the head and the Chief of the Government.\r\nThat question came before the American People.\r\n\r\n\"At that time I was advised of this state of feeling--and I will state\r\nit in as exact form of words as I can state it, that it may be\r\nunderstood by Senators: Mr. Douglas is a man acceptable to the South.\r\nMr. Douglas is a man to whom no one has just cause of exception\r\nthroughout the South.  Mr. Douglas is more acceptable to Mississippi and\r\nLouisiana than Mr. Breckinridge.  Mr. Breckinridge is not acceptable to\r\nthe South; or at least, if he is so, he is not in the same degree with\r\nMr. Douglas.  Mr. Douglas is the accepted man of a great National Party,\r\nand if he is brought into the field he will be triumphantly elected.\r\nTHAT MUST NOT BE DONE, because THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECESSION IS\r\nMATURED.  EVERYTHING IS PREPARED, and the election of Mr. Douglas would\r\nonly postpone it for four years; and Now when we are PREPARED to carry\r\nout these things WE MUST INDULGE IN STRATAGEM, and the nomination of Mr.\r\nBreckinridge is a mere strategic movement to divide the great\r\nconservative Party of the Nation into two, so as to elect a Republican\r\ncandidate AND CONSOLIDATE THE SOUTH BY THE CRY OF 'ABOLITIONIST!'\r\n\r\n\"That is a mere simple statement of the truth, and it cannot be\r\ncontradicted.  Now, in that scheme all the men of counsel of that Party\r\nwere engaged.  * * *  I, on the far shores of the Pacific understood\r\nthose things as long ago as a year last September (1860).  I was advised\r\nabout this policy and well informed of it.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"I was at war, in California, in January (1861) last; in the maintenance\r\nof the opinions that I am now maintaining, I had to go armed to protect\r\nmyself from violence.  The country, whenever there was controversy, was\r\nagitated to its deepest foundations.  That is known, perhaps, not to\r\ngentlemen who live up in Maine or Massachusetts, or where you are\r\nforeign to all this agitation; but known to all people where disturbance\r\nmight have been effective in consequences.  I felt it, and had to carry\r\nmy life in my hand by the month, as did my friends surrounding me.\r\n\r\n\"I say that all through last winter (that of 1860-61) War had been\r\ninaugurated in all those parts of the Country where disturbed elements\r\ncould have efficient result.  In January (1861), a year ago, I stood in\r\nthe hall of the House of Representatives of my State, and there was War\r\nthen, and angry faces and hostile men were gathered; and we knew then\r\nwell that the Southern States had determined to withdraw themselves from\r\nthe Federal Union.\r\n\r\n\"I happened to be one of those men who said, 'they shall not do it;' and\r\nit appears to me that the whole argument is between that class of men\r\nand the class of men who said they would let them do it.  * * *  When\r\nthis doctrine was started here of disintegrating the Cotton States from\r\nthe rest of the Confederacy, I opposed it at once.  I saw immediately\r\nthat War was to be invoked.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"I will not say these things were understood by gentlemen of the\r\nRepublican Party * * * but I, having been accepted and received as a\r\nDemocrat of the old school from the olden time, and HAVING FAST SOUTHERN\r\nSYMPATHIES, I DID KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM. * * * I KNOW THAT SECESSION WAS A\r\nTHING DETERMINED UPON.  * * * I was advised of and understood the whole\r\nprogramme, KNEW HOW IT WAS TO BE DONE IN ITS DETAILS; and I being\r\nadvised, made war against it.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"War had been, in fact, inaugurated.  What is War?  Was it the firing on\r\nour flag at Sumter?  Was that the first adversary passage?  To say so,\r\nis trifling with men's judgments and information.  No, sir; when they\r\norganized a Government, and set us at defiance, they commenced War; and\r\nthe various steps they took afterwards, by organizing their troops, and\r\nforming their armies, and advancing upon Sumter; all these were merely\r\nacts of War; but War was inaugurated whenever they undertook to say they\r\nwould maintain themselves as a separate and independent government; and,\r\nafter that time, every man who gave his assistance to them was a\r\nTraitor, according to the highest Law.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter, written by one of the most active of the Southern\r\nconspirators in 1858, during the great Douglas and Lincoln Debate of\r\nthat year, to which extended reference has already been made, is of\r\ninterest in this connection, not only as corroborative evidence of the\r\nfact that the Rebellion of the Cotton States had been determined on long\r\nbefore Mr. Lincoln was elected President, but as showing also that the\r\nmachinery for \"firing the Southern heart\" and for making a \"solid South\"\r\nwas being perfected even then.  The subsequent split in the Democratic\r\nParty, and nomination of Breckinridge by the Southern wing of it, was\r\nmanaged by this same Yancey, simply as parts of the deliberate programme\r\nof Secession and Rebellion long before determined on by the Cotton Lords\r\nof the Cotton States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         \"MONTGOMERY, June 15, 1858.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR SIR:--Your kind favor of the 13th is received.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly agree with you that a general movement can be made that will\r\nclean out the Augean Stable.  If the Democracy were overthrown it would\r\nresult in giving place to a greedier and hungrier swarm of flies.\r\n\r\n\"The remedy of the South is not in such a process.  It is in a diligent\r\norganization of her true men for prompt resistance to the next\r\naggression.  It must come in the nature of things.  No National Party\r\ncan save us.  No Sectional Party can ever do it.  But if we could do as\r\nour fathers did--organize 'Committees of Safety' all over the Cotton\r\nStates (and it is only in them that we can hope for any effective\r\nmovement), we shall fire the Southern heart, instruct the Southern mind,\r\ngive courage to each other, and at the proper moment, by one organized,\r\nconcerted action, we can precipitate the Cotton States into a\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\"The idea has been shadowed forth in the South by Mr. Ruffin; has been\r\ntaken up and recommended in the Advertiser under the name of 'League of\r\nUnited Southerners,' who, keeping up their old relations on all other\r\nquestions, will hold the Southern issues paramount, and influence\r\nparties, legislatures and statesmen.  I have no time to enlarge, but to\r\nsuggest merely.\r\n\r\n\"In haste, yours, etc.\r\n                         \"W. L. YANCEY.\r\n\r\n\"To JAMES S. SLAUGHTER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Jackson, Mississippi, in the fall of the same year (1858) just after\r\nthe great Debate between Douglas and Lincoln had closed, Jefferson Davis\r\nhad already raised the standard of Revolution, Secession and Disunion,\r\nduring the course of a speech, in which he said: \"If an Abolitionist be\r\nchosen President of the United States, you will have presented to you\r\nthe question of whether you will permit the Government to pass into the\r\nhands of your avowed and implacable enemies?  Without pausing for an\r\nanswer, I will state my own position to be, that such a result would be\r\na species of revolution by which the purposes of the Government would be\r\ndestroyed, and the observance of its mere forms entitled to no respect.\r\nIn that event, in such a manner as should be most expedient, I should\r\ndeem it your duty to provide for your safety, outside of the Union with\r\nthose who have already shown the will, and would have acquired the power\r\nto deprive you of your birthright, and to reduce you to worse than the\r\nColonial dependence of your fathers.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"birthright\" thus referred to was of course, the alleged right to\r\nhave Slaves; but what was this \"worse than Colonial dependence\" to\r\nwhich, in addition to the peril supposed to threaten the Southern\r\n\"birthright,\" the Cotton States of Mississippi were reduced?\r\n\"Dependence\" upon whom, and with regard to what?  Plainly upon the\r\nNorth; and with regard, not to Slavery alone--for Jefferson Davis held,\r\ndown to the very close of the War, that the South fought \"not for\r\nSlavery\"--but as to Tariff Legislation also.  There was the rub! These\r\nCotton Lords believed, or pretended to believe, that the High Tariff\r\nLegislation, advocated and insisted upon both by the Whigs and\r\nRepublicans for the Protection of the American Manufacturer and working\r\nman, built up and made prosperous the North, and elevated Northern\r\nlaborers; at the expense of the South, and especially themselves, the\r\nCotton Lords aforesaid.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen from the utterances of leading men in the South\r\nCarolina, Secession Convention, \"that\"--as Governor Hicks, himself a\r\nSouthern man, said in his address to the people of Maryland, after\r\nthe War broke out \"neither the election of Mr. Lincoln, nor the\r\nnon-execution of the Fugitive Slave Law, nor both combined, constitute\r\ntheir grievances.  They declare that THE REAL CAUSE of their discontent\r\nDATES AS FAR BACK AS 1833.\"\r\n\r\nAnd what was the chief cause or pretext for discontent at that time?\r\nNothing less than the Tariff.  They wanted Free Trade, as well as\r\nSlavery.  The balance of the Union wanted Protection, as well as\r\nFreedom.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent War, then, was not a War waged for Slavery alone, but for\r\nIndependence with a view to Free Trade, as set forth in the \"Confederate\r\nConstitution,\" as soon as that Independence could be achieved.  And the\r\nWar on our part, while for the integrity of the Union in all its parts\r\n--for the life of the Nation itself, and for the freedom of man, should\r\nalso have brought the triumph of the American idea of a Protective\r\nTariff, whose chief object is the building up of American manufactures\r\nand the Protection of the Free working-man, in the essential matters of\r\neducation, food, clothing, rents, wages, and work.\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned in McPherson's History of the Rebellion, p. 392, that in\r\na letter making public his reasons for going to Washington and taking\r\nhis seat in Congress, Mr. James L. Pugh, a Representative from Alabama,\r\nNovember 24, 1860, said: \"The sole object of my visit is to promote the\r\ncause of Secession.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the manner in which they acted after reaching Washington, it is not\r\nunreasonable to suppose that most of those persons representing, in both\r\nbranches of Congress, the Southern States which afterwards seceded, came\r\nto the National Capital with a similar object in view--taking their\r\nsalaries and mileages for services supposed to be performed for the\r\nbenefit of the very Government they were conspiring to injure, and\r\nswearing anew the sacred oath to support and defend the very\r\nConstitution which they were moving heaven and earth to undermine and\r\ndestroy!\r\n\r\n     [As a part of the history of those times, the following letter is\r\n     not without interest:\r\n\r\n     \"OXFORD, December 24, 1860.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR:--I regretted having to leave Washington without\r\n     having with you a full conference as to the great events whose\r\n     shadows are upon us.

The\r\n     friends of Southern Independence, of firm and bona fide resistance,\r\n     won an overwhelming victory; but I doubt whether there is any\r\n     precise plan.\r\n\r\n     \"No doubt a large majority of the Convention will be for separate\r\n     Secession.

Our friends in Pontotoc, Tippah,\r\n     De Soto and Pauola took grounds which fell far short of that idea,\r\n     though their resolutions were very firm in regard to Disunion and\r\n     an ultimate result.\r\n\r\n     \"In the meantime the Disunion sentiment among the people is growing\r\n     every day more intense.\r\n\r\n     \"Upon the whole, you have great cause for gratification in the\r\n     action of your State.\r\n\r\n     \"The submissionists are routed, horse, foot, and dragoons, and any\r\n     concession by the North will fail to restore that sacred attachment\r\n     to the Union which was once so deeply radicated in the hearts of\r\n     our people.

It was a secret\r\nconference, but the programme resolved on, soon leaked out.\r\n\r\nThe following, which appeared in the Washington National Intelligencer\r\non Friday, January 11, 1861, tells the story of this stage of the Great\r\nConspiracy pretty clearly:\r\n\r\n\"The subjoined communication, disclosing the designs of those who have\r\nundertaken to lead the movement now threatening a permanent dissolution\r\nof the Union, comes to us from a distinguished citizen of the South\r\n[understood to be Honorable Lemuel D.

It was then and\r\nthere resolved in effect to assume to themselves the political power of\r\nthe South, and, to control all political and military operations for the\r\npresent, they telegraphed to complete the plan of seizing forts,\r\narsenals, and custom-houses, and advised the Conventions now in session,\r\nand soon to assemble, to pass Ordinances for immediate Secession; but,\r\nin order to thwart any operations of the Government here, the\r\nConventions of the Seceding States are to retain their representations\r\nin the Senate and the House.\r\n\r\n\"'They also advised, ordered, or directed the assembling of a Convention\r\nof delegates from the Seceding States at Montgomery on the 13th of\r\nFebruary.  This can of course only be done by the revolutionary\r\nConventions usurping the powers of the people, and sending delegates\r\nover whom they will lose all control in the establishment of a\r\nProvisional Government, which is the plan of the dictators.\r\n\r\n\"'This Caucus also resolved to take the most effectual means to dragoon\r\nthe Legislatures of Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, and\r\nVirginia into following the Seceding States.  Maryland is also to be\r\ninfluenced by such appeals to popular passion as have led to the\r\nrevolutionary steps which promise a conflict with the State and Federal\r\nGovernments in Texas.\r\n\r\n\"'They have possessed themselves of all the avenues of information in\r\nthe South--the telegraph, the press, and the general control of the\r\npostmasters.

Senators\r\nentrusted with the representative sovereignty of the States, and sworn\r\nto support the Constitution of the United States, while yet acting as\r\nthe privy councillors of the President, and anxiously looked to by their\r\nconstituents to effect some practical plan of adjustment, deliberately\r\nconceive a Conspiracy for the overthrow of the Government through the\r\nmilitary organizations, the dangerous secret order, the 'Knights of the\r\nGolden Circle,' 'Committees of Safety,' Southern leagues, and other\r\nagencies at their command; they have instituted as thorough a military\r\nand civil despotism as ever cursed a maddened Country.\r\n\r\n\"'It is not difficult to foresee the form of government which a\r\nConvention thus hurriedly thrown together at Montgomery will irrevocably\r\nfasten upon a deluded and unsuspecting people.  It must essentially be\r\n'a Monarchy founded upon military principles,' or it cannot endure.\r\nThose who usurp power never fail to forge strong chains.\r\n\r\n\"'It may be too late to sound the alarm.  Nothing may be able to arrest\r\nthe action of revolutionary tribunals whose decrees are principally in\r\n'secret sessions.'  But I call upon the people to pause and reflect\r\nbefore they are forced to surrender every principle of liberty, or to\r\nfight those who are becoming their masters rather than their servants.\r\n                                   \"'EATON\"\r\n\r\n\"As confirming the intelligence furnished by our informant we may cite\r\nthe following extract from the Washington correspondence of yesterday's\r\nBaltimore Sun:\r\n\r\n\"'The leaders of the Southern movement are consulting as to the best\r\nmode of consolidating their interests into a Confederacy under a\r\nProvisional Government.

Colonel Davis is a graduate of West Point, was\r\ndistinguished for gallantry at Buena Vista, and served as Secretary of\r\nWar under President Pierce, and is not second to General Scott in\r\nmilitary science or courage.'\r\n\r\n\"As further confirmatory of the above, the following telegraphic\r\ndispatch in the Charleston Mercury of January 7, 1861, is given:\r\n\r\n\"'[From our Own Correspondent.]\r\n\r\n\"'WASHINGTON, January 6.--The Senators from those of the Southern States\r\nwhich have called Conventions of their people, met in caucus last night,\r\nand adopted the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved, That we recommend to our respective States immediate\r\nSecession.\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved, That we recommend the holding of a General Convention of the\r\nsaid States, to be holden in the city of Montgomery, Alabama, at some\r\nperiod not later than the 15th day of February, 1861.'\r\n\r\n\"These resolutions were telegraphed this evening to the Conventions of\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, and Florida.  A third resolution is also known to\r\nhave been adopted, but it is of a confidential character, not to be\r\ndivulged at present.  There was a good deal of discussion in the caucus\r\non the question of whether the Seceding States ought to continue their\r\ndelegations in Congress till the 4th of March, to prevent unfriendly\r\nlegislation, or whether the Representatives of the Seceding States\r\nshould all resign together, and leave a clear field for the opposition\r\nto pass such bills, looking to Coercion, as they may see fit.  It is\r\nbelieved that the opinion that they should remain prevailed.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, upon the capture of Fernandina, Florida, in 1862, the\r\nfollowing letter was found and published.  Senator Yulee, the writer,\r\nwas present and participated as one of the Florida Senators, in the\r\ntraitorous \"Consultation\" therein referred to--and hence its especial\r\nvalue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON, January 7, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"My DEAR SIR:--On the other side is a copy of resolutions adopted at a\r\nconsultation of the Senators from the Seceding States--in which Georgia,\r\nAlabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi, and Florida were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\"The idea of the meeting was that the States should go out at once, and\r\nprovide for the early organization of a Confederate Government, not\r\nlater than 15th February.

It seemed to be the opinion that if we left here,\r\nforce, loan, and volunteer Bills might be passed, which would put Mr.\r\nLincoln in immediate condition for hostilities; whereas, by remaining in\r\nour places until the 4th of March, it is thought we can keep the hands\r\nof Mr. Buchanan tied, and disable the Republicans from effecting any\r\nlegislation which will strengthen the hands of the incoming\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\n\"The resolutions will be sent by the delegation to the President of the\r\nConvention.  I have not been able to find Mr. Mallory (his Senatorial\r\ncolleague) this morning.  Hawkins (Representative from Florida) is in\r\nConnecticut.  I have therefore thought it best to send you this copy of\r\nthe resolutions.\r\n\r\n               \"In haste, yours truly\r\n                                   \"D. L. YULEE.\r\n\r\n\"JOSEPH FINEGAN, Esq.,\r\n\"'Sovereignty Convention,' Tallahassee, Fla.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolutions \"on the other side\" of this letter, to which he refers,\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, 1--That in our opinion each of the Southern States should, as\r\nsoon as may be, Secede from the Union.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, 2--That provision should be made for a Convention to organize\r\na Confederacy of the Seceding States, the Convention to meet not later\r\nthan the 15th of February, at the city of Montgomery, in the State of\r\nAlabama.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That in view of the hostile legislation that is threatened\r\nagainst the Seceding States, and which may be consummated before the 4th\r\nof March, we ask instructions whether the delegations are to remain in\r\nCongress until that date for the purpose of defeating such legislation.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That a committee be and are hereby appointed, consisting of\r\nMessrs. Davis, Slidell, and Mallory, to carry out the objects of this\r\nmeeting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn giving this letter to the World--from its correspondent accompanying\r\nthe expedition--the New York Times of March 15, 1862, made these\r\nforcible and clear-headed comments:\r\n\r\n\"The telegraphic columns of the Times of January 7, 1861, contained the\r\nfollowing Washington dispatch: 'The Southern Senators last night\r\n(January 5th) held a conference, and telegraphed to the Conventions of\r\ntheir respective States to advise immediate Secession.'  Now, the\r\npresent letter is a report by Mr. Yulee, who was present at this\r\n'consultation' as he calls it, of the resolutions adopted on this\r\noccasion, transmitted to the said Finegan, who by the way, was a member\r\nof the 'Sovereign Convention' of Florida, then sitting in the town of\r\nTallahassee.\r\n\r\n\"It will thus be seen that this remarkable letter, which breathes\r\nthroughout the spirit of the Conspirator, in reality lets us into one of\r\nthe most important of the numerous Secret Conclaves which the Plotters\r\nof Treason then held in the Capital.  It was then, as it appears, that\r\nthey determined to strike the blow and precipitate their States into\r\nSecession.  But at the same time they resolved that it would be\r\nimprudent for them openly to withdraw, as in that case Congress might\r\npass 'force, loan, and volunteer bills,' which would put Mr. Lincoln in\r\nimmediate condition for hostilities.  No, no!  that would not do.  (So\r\nmuch patriotic virtue they half suspected, half feared, was left in the\r\nCountry.)  On the contrary, 'by remaining in our places until the 4th of\r\nMarch it is thought we can keep the hands of Mr. Buchanan tied, and\r\ndisable the Republicans from effecting any legislation which will\r\nstrengthen the hands of the incoming Administration.'  Ah what a tragic\r\nback-ground, full of things unutterable, is there!\r\n\r\n\"It appears, however, that events were faster than they, and instead of\r\nbeing able to retain their seats up to the 4th of March, they were able\r\nto remain but a very few weeks.  Mr. Davis withdrew on the 21st of\r\nJanuary, just a fortnight after this 'consultation.'  But for the rest,\r\nmark how faithfully the programme here drawn up by this knot of Traitors\r\nin secret session was realized.  Each of the named States represented by\r\nthis Cabal did, 'as soon as may be, Secede from the Union'--the\r\nMississippi Convention passing its Ordinance on the heels of the receipt\r\nof these resolutions, on the 9th of January; Florida and Alabama on the\r\n11th; Louisiana on the 26th, and Texas on the 1st of February; while the\r\n'organization of the Confederate Government' took place at the very time\r\nappointed, Davis being inaugurated on the 18th of February.\r\n\r\n\"And here is another Plot of the Traitors brought to light.  These very\r\nmen, on withdrawing from the Senate, urged that they were doing so in\r\nobedience to the command of their respective States.  As Mr. Davis put\r\nit, in his parting speech, 'the Ordinance of Secession having passed the\r\nConvention of his State, he felt obliged to obey the summons, and retire\r\nfrom all official connection with the Federal Government.'  This letter\r\nof Mr. Yulee's clearly reveals that they had themselves pushed their\r\nState Conventions to the adoption of the very measure which they had the\r\nhardihood to put forward as an imperious 'summons' which they could not\r\ndisobey.  It is thus that Treason did its Work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                  COPPERHEADISM  VS. UNION DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that it was on the night of the 5th of January, 1861,\r\nthat the Rebel Conspirators in the United States Senate met and plotted\r\ntheir confederated Treason, as shown in the Yulee letter, given in the\r\npreceding Chapter of this work, and that on the very next day, January\r\n6, 1861, Fernando Wood, then Mayor of the great city of New York, sent\r\nin to the Common Council of that metropolis, his recommendation that New\r\nYork city should Secede from its own State, as well as the United\r\nStates, and become \"a Free City,\" which, said he, \"may shed the only\r\nlight and hope of a future reconstruction of our once blessed\r\nConfederacy,\" it is impossible to resist the conviction that this\r\nextraordinary movement of his, was inspired and prompted, if not\r\nabsolutely directed, by the secret Rebel Conclave at Washington.  It\r\nbears within itself internal evidences of such prompting.\r\n\r\nThus, when Mayor Wood states the case in the following words, he seems\r\nto be almost quoting word for word an instruction received by him from\r\nthese Rebel leaders--in connection with their plausible argument,\r\nupholding it.  Says he:\r\n\r\n\"Much, no doubt, can be said in favor of the justice and policy of a\r\nseparation.  It may be said that Secession or revolution in any of the\r\nUnited States would be subversive of all Federal authority, and, so far\r\nas the central Government is concerned, the resolving of the community\r\ninto its original elements--that, if part of the States form new\r\ncombinations and, Governments, other States may do the same.  Then it\r\nmay be said, why should not New York city, instead of supporting by her\r\ncontributions in revenue two-thirds of the expenses of the United\r\nStates, become also equally independent?  As a Free City, with but\r\nnominal duty on imports, her local Government could be supported without\r\ntaxation upon her people.  Thus we could live free from taxes, and have\r\ncheap goods nearly duty free.  In this she would have the whole and\r\nunited support of the Southern States, as well as all the other States\r\nto whose interests and rights under the Constitution she has always been\r\ntrue.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the persuasive casuistry peculiar to the minds of the Southern\r\nSecession leaders.  It is naturally followed by a touch of that\r\nself-confident bluster, also at that time peculiar to Southern lips\r\n--as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is well for individuals or communities to look every danger square\r\nin the face, and to meet it calmly and bravely.  As dreadful as the\r\nsevering of the bonds that have hitherto united the States has been in\r\ncontemplation, it is now apparently a stern and inevitable fact.  We\r\nhave now to meet it, with all the consequences, whatever they may be.\r\nIf the Confederacy is broken up the Government is dissolved, and it\r\nbehooves every distinct community, as well as every individual, to take\r\ncare of themselves.\r\n\r\n\"When Disunion has become a fixed and certain fact, why may not New York\r\ndisrupt the bands which bind her to a venal and corrupt master--to a\r\npeople and a Party that have plundered her revenues, attempted to ruin\r\nher commerce, taken away the power of self-government, and destroyed the\r\nConfederacy of which she was the proud Empire City? * * *\"\r\n\r\nAfter thus restating, as it were, the views and \"arguments\" of the Rebel\r\nJunta, as we may presume them to have been pressed on him, he becomes\r\nsuddenly startled at the Conclave's idea of meeting \"all the\r\nconsequences, whatever they may be,\" and, turning completely around,\r\nwith blanching pen, concludes:\r\n\r\n\"But I am not prepared to recommend the violence implied in these views.\r\nIn stating this argument in favor of freedom, 'peaceably if we can,\r\nforcibly if we must,' let me not be misunderstood.  The redress can be\r\nfound only in appeals to the magnanimity of the people of the whole\r\nState.\" * * *\r\n\r\nIf \"these views\" were his own, and not those of the Rebel Conclave, he\r\nwould either have been \"prepared to recommend the violence implied in\r\nthem,\" or else he would have suppressed them altogether.  But his\r\nutterance is that of one who has certain views for the first time placed\r\nbefore him, and shrinks from the consequences of their advocacy--shrinks\r\nfrom \"the violence implied\" in them--although for some reason he dares\r\nnot refuse to place those views before the people.\r\n\r\nAnd, in carrying out his promise to do so--\"In stating this argument,\"\r\npresumably of the Rebel Conclave, \"in favor of freedom, 'peaceably if we\r\ncan, forcibly if we must'\"--the language used is an admission that the\r\nargument is not his own.  Were it his own, would he not have said in\r\n\"making\" it, instead of in \"stating\" it?  Furthermore, had he been\r\n\"making\" it of his own accord, he would hardly have involved himself in\r\nsuch singular contradictions and explanations as are here apparent.  He\r\nwas plainly \"stating\" the Rebel Conclave's argument, not making one\r\nhimself.  He was obeying orders, under the protest of his fears.  And\r\nthose fears forced his trembling pen to write the saving-clause which\r\n\"qualifies\" the Conclave's second-hand bluster preceding it.\r\n\r\nThat the Rebels hoped for Northern assistance in case of Secession, is\r\nvery clear from many speeches made prior to and soon after the election\r\nof Mr. Lincoln to the Presidency--and from other sources of information.\r\nThus we find in a speech made by Representative L. M. Keitt, of South\r\nCarolina, in Charleston, November, 1860, the following language,\r\nreported by the Mercury:\r\n\r\n\"But we have been threatened.  Mr. Amos Kendall wrote a letter, in which\r\nhe said to Colonel Orr, that if the State went out, three hundred\r\nthousand volunteers were ready to march against her.  I know little\r\nabout Kendall--and the less the better.  He was under General Jackson;\r\nbut for him the Federal treasury seemed to have a magnetic attraction.\r\n\r\n\"Jackson was a pure man, but he had too many around him who made\r\nfortunes far transcending their salaries.  [Applause.]  And this Amos\r\nKendall had the same good fortune under Van Buren.  He (Kendall)\r\nthreatened us on the one side, and John Hickman on the other.  John\r\nHickman said, defiantly, that if we went out of the Union, eighteen\r\nmillions of Northern men would bring us back.\r\n\r\n\"Let me tell you, there are a million of Democrats in the North who,\r\nwhen the Black Republicans attempt to march upon the South, will be\r\nfound a wall of fire in the front.  [Cries of 'that's so,' and\r\napplause.]\"\r\n\r\nHarper's Weekly of May 28, 1864, commenting on certain letters of M. F.\r\nMaury and others, then just come to light, said:\r\n\r\n\"How far Maury and his fellow-conspirators were justified in their hopes\r\nof seducing New Jersey into the Rebellion, may be gathered from the\r\ncorrespondence that took place, in the spring of 1861, between\r\nEx-Governor Price, of New Jersey, who was one of the representatives from\r\nthat State in the Peace Congress, and L. W. Burnet, Esq., of Newark.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Price, in answering the question what ought New Jersey to do, says:\r\n'I believe the Southern confederation permanent.  The proceeding has\r\nbeen taken with forethought and deliberation--it is no hurried impulse,\r\nbut an irrevocable act, based upon the sacred, as was supposed, equality\r\nof the States; and in my opinion every Slave State will in a short\r\nperiod of time be found united in one Confederacy.  * * *  Before that\r\nevent happens, we cannot act, however much we may suffer in our material\r\ninterests.  It is in that contingency, then, that I answer the second\r\npart of your question:--What position for New Jersey will best accord\r\nwith her interests, honor, and the patriotic instincts of her people?  I\r\nsay emphatically she would go with the South from every wise,\r\nprudential, and patriotic reason.'\r\n\r\n\"Ex-Governor Price proceeds to say that he is confident the States of\r\nPennsylvania and New York will 'choose also to cast their lot with the\r\nSouth, and after them, the Western and Northwestern States.'\"\r\n\r\nThe following resolution,* was adopted with others, by a meeting of\r\nDemocrats held January 16, 1861, at National Hall, Philadelphia, and has\r\nbeen supposed to disclose \"a plan, of which ex-Governor Price was likely\r\naware:\"\r\n\r\n\"Twelfth--That in the deliberate judgment of the Democracy of\r\nPhiladelphia, and, so far as we know it, of Pennsylvania, the\r\ndissolution of the Union by the separation of the whole South, a result\r\nwe shall most sincerely lament, may release this Commonwealth to a large\r\nextent from the bonds which now connect her with the Confederacy, except\r\nso far as for temporary convenience she chooses to submit to them, and\r\nwould authorize and require her citizens, through a Convention, to be\r\nassembled for that purpose, to determine with whom her lot should be\r\ncast, whether with the North and the East, whose fanaticism has\r\nprecipitated this misery upon us, or with our brethren of the South,\r\nwhose wrongs we feel as our own; or whether Pennsylvania should stand by\r\nherself, as a distinct community, ready when occasion offers, to bind\r\ntogether the broken Union, and resume her place of loyalty and\r\ndevotion.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Lane of Oregon, replying to Senator Johnson of Tennessee,\r\nDecember 19, 1860, in the United States Senate, and speaking of and for\r\nthe Northern Democracy, said:\r\n\r\n\"They will not march with him under his bloody banner, or Mr. Lincoln's,\r\nto invade the soil of the gallant State of South Carolina, when she may\r\nwithdraw from a Confederacy that has refused her that equality to which\r\nshe is entitled, as a member of the Union, under the Constitution.  On\r\nthe contrary, when he or any other gentleman raises that banner and\r\nattempts to subjugate that gallant people, instead of marching with him,\r\nwe will meet him there, ready to repel him and his forces.  He shall not\r\nbring with him the Northern Democracy to strike down a people contending\r\nfor rights that have been refused them in a Union that ought to\r\nrecognize the equality of every member of the Confederacy.  * * *  I now\r\nserve notice that, when War is made upon that gallant South for\r\nwithdrawing from a Union which refuses them their rights, the Northern\r\nDemocracy will not join in the crusade.  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL HAVE\r\nWAR ENOUGH AT HOME.  THE DEMOCRACY OF THE NORTH NEED NOT CROSS THE\r\nBORDER TO FIND AN ENEMY.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Ex-President Pierce is in the same misleading\r\nstrain:\r\n\r\n\"CLARENDON HOTEL, January 6, 1860.--[This letter was captured, at Jeff.\r\nDavis's house in Mississippi, by the Union troops.]\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR FRIEND:--I wrote you an unsatisfactory note a day or two since.\r\nI have just had a pleasant interview with Mr. Shepley, whose courage and\r\nfidelity are equal to his learning and talents.  He says he would rather\r\nfight the battle with you as the standard-bearer in 1860, than under the\r\nauspices of any other leader.  The feeling and judgment of Mr. S. in\r\nthis relation is, I am confident, rapidly gaining ground in New England.\r\nOur people are looking for 'the coming man,' one who is raised by all\r\nthe elements of his character above the atmosphere ordinarily breathed\r\nby politicians, a man really fitted for this exigency by his ability,\r\ncourage, broad statesmanship, and patriotism.  Colonel Seymour (Thomas\r\nH.) arrived here this morning, and expressed his views in this relation\r\nin almost the identical language used by Mr. Shepley.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that, in the present state of things at Washington and\r\nthroughout the country, no man can predict what changes two or three\r\nmonths may bring forth.  Let me suggest that, in the running debates in\r\nCongress, full justice seems to me not to have been done to the\r\nDemocracy of the North.  I do not believe that our friends at the South\r\nhave any just idea of the state of feeling, hurrying at this moment to\r\nthe pitch of intense exasperation, between those who respect their\r\npolitical obligations and those who have apparently no impelling power\r\nbut that which fanatical passion on the subject of Domestic Slavery\r\nimparts.\r\n\r\n\"Without discussing the question of right, of abstract power to Secede,\r\nI have never believed that actual disruption of the Union can occur\r\nwithout blood; and if, through the madness of Northern Abolitionism,\r\nthat dire calamity must come, THE FIGHTING WILL NOT BE ALONG MASON'S AND\r\nDIXON'S LINE MERELY.  IT [WILL] BE WITHIN OUR OWN BORDERS, IN OUR OWN\r\nSTREETS, BETWEEN THE TWO CLASSES OF CITIZENS TO WHOM I HAVE REFERRED.\r\nThose who defy law and scout Constitutional obligations will, if we ever\r\nreach the arbitrament of arms, FIND OCCUPATION ENOUGH AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but the state of Mrs. Pierce's health would induce me to leave\r\nthe Country now, although it is quite likely that my presence at home\r\nwould be of little service.\r\n\r\n\"I have tried to impress upon our people, especially in New Hampshire\r\nand Connecticut, where the only elections are to take place during the\r\ncoming spring, that while our Union meetings are all in the right\r\ndirection, and well enough for the present, they will not be worth the\r\npaper upon which their resolutions are written unless we can overthrow\r\npolitical Abolitionism at the polls and repeal the Unconstitutional and\r\nobnoxious laws which, in the cause of 'personal liberty,' have been\r\nplaced upon our statute-books.  I shall look with deep interest, and not\r\nwithout hope, for a decided change in this relation.\r\n\r\n                    \"Ever and truly your friend,\r\n                                        \"FRANKLIN PIERCE.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. JEFF. DAVIS,\r\n\"Washington, D. C.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut let us turn from contemplating the encouragements to Southern\r\nTreason and Rebellion, held out by Northern Democratic Copperheads, to\r\nthe more pleasing spectacle of Loyalty and Patriotism exhibited by the\r\nDouglas wing of Democracy.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Sumter, and while the President was formulating his\r\nMessage, calling for 75,000 volunteers, Douglas called upon him at the\r\nWhite House, regretted that Mr. Lincoln did not propose to call for\r\nthrice as many; and on the 18th of April, having again visited the White\r\nHouse, wrote, and gave the following dispatch to the Associated Press,\r\nfor circulation throughout the Country:\r\n\r\n\"April 18, 1861, Senator Douglas called on the President, and had an\r\ninteresting conversation on the present condition of the Country.  The\r\nsubstance of it was, on the part of Mr. Douglas, that while he was\r\nunalterably opposed to the administration in all its political issues,\r\nhe was prepared to fully sustain the President in the exercise of all\r\nhis Constitutional functions, to preserve the Union, maintain the\r\nGovernment, and defend the Federal Capital.  A firm policy and prompt\r\naction was necessary.  The Capital was in danger and must be defended at\r\nall hazards, and at any expense of men and money.  He spoke of the\r\npresent and future without any reference to the past.\"\r\n\r\nIt is stated of this meeting and its immediate results: \"The President\r\nwas deeply gratified by the interview.  To the West, Douglas\r\ntelegraphed, 'I am for my Country and against all its assailants.'  The\r\nfire of his patriotism spread to the masses of the North, and Democrat\r\nand Republican rallied to the support of the flag.  In Illinois the\r\nDemocratic and Republican presses vied with each other in the utterance\r\nof patriotic sentiments.  * * *  Large and numerously attended Mass\r\nmeetings met, as it were with one accord, irrespective of parties, and\r\nthe people of all shades of political opinions buried their party\r\nhatchets.  Glowing and eloquent orators exhorted the people to ignore\r\npolitical differences in the present crisis, join in the common cause,\r\nand rally to the flag of the Union and the Constitution.  It was a noble\r\ntruce.  From the many resolutions of that great outpouring of patriotic\r\nsentiment, which ignored all previous party ties, we subjoin the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved, that it is the duty of all patriotic citizens of Illinois,\r\nwithout distinction of party or sect, to sustain the Government through\r\nthe peril which now threatens the existence of the Union; and of our\r\nLegislature to grant such aid of men and money as the exigency of the\r\nhour and the patriotism of our people shall demand.'\r\n\r\n\"Governor Yates promptly issued his proclamation, dated the 15th of\r\nApril, convening the Legislature for the 23rd inst. in Extraordinary\r\nSession.\r\n\r\n                     *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"On the evening of the 25th of April, Mr. Douglas, who had arrived at\r\nthe Capital the day before, addressed the General Assembly and a densely\r\npacked audience, in the Hall of Representatives, in that masterly\r\neffort, which must live and be enshrined in the hearts of his countrymen\r\nso long as our Government shall endure.  Douglas had ever delighted in\r\nthe mental conflicts of Party strife; but now, when his Country was\r\nassailed by the red hand of Treason, he was instantly divested of his\r\nParty armor and stood forth panoplied only in the pure garb of a true\r\nPatriot.\r\n\r\n\"He taught his auditory--he taught his Country, for his speeches were\r\ntelegraphed all over it--the duty of patriotism at that perilous hour of\r\nthe Nation's Life.  He implored both Democrats and Republicans to lay\r\naside their Party creeds and Platforms; to dispense with Party\r\nOrganizations and Party Appeals; to forget that they were ever divided\r\nuntil they had first rescued the Government from its assailants.  His\r\narguments were clear, convincing, and unanswerable; his appeals for the\r\nSalvation of his Country, irresistible.  It was the last speech, but\r\none, he ever made.\"\r\n\r\nAmong other pithy and patriotic points made by him in that great speech\r\n--[July 9, 1861.]--were these: \"So long as there was a hope of a\r\npeaceful solution, I prayed and implored for Compromise.  I have spared\r\nno effort for a peaceful solution of these troubles; I have failed, and\r\nthere is but one thing to do--to rally under the flag.\"   \"The South has\r\nno cause of complaint.\"  \"Shall we obey the laws or adopt the Mexican\r\nsystem of War, on every election.\"  \"Forget Party--all remember only\r\nyour Country.\"  \"The shortest road to Peace is the most tremendous\r\npreparation for War.\"  \"It is with a sad heart and with a grief I have\r\nnever before experienced, that I have to contemplate this fearful\r\nStruggle.  * * *  But it is our duty to protect the Government and the\r\nflag from every assailant, be he who he may.\"\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, Douglas repeated his patriotic appeal for the preservation\r\nof the Union, and tersely declared that \"There can be no Neutrals in\r\nthis War--only Patriots and Traitors.\"  In that city he was taken with a\r\nmortal illness, and expired at the Tremont House, June 3, 1861--just one\r\nmonth prior to the meeting of the called Session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful influence wielded by Douglas throughout the North, was\r\nwell described afterward by his colleague, Judge Trumbull, in the\r\nSenate, when he said: \"His course had much to do in producing that\r\nunanimity in support of the Government which is now seen throughout the\r\nLoyal States.  The sublime spectacle of twenty million people rising as\r\none man in vindication of Constitutional Liberty and Free Government,\r\nwhen assailed by misguided Rebels and plotting Traitors, is, to a\r\nconsiderable extent due to his efforts.  His magnanimous and patriotic\r\ncourse in this trying hour of his Country's destiny was the crowning act\r\nof his life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Senator McDougall of California--his life-long friend--in describing\r\nthe shock of the first intelligence that reached him, of his friend's\r\nsudden death, with words of even greater power, continued: \"But, as,\r\npowerless for the moment to resist the tide of emotions, I bowed my head\r\nin silent grief, it came to me that the Senator had lived to witness the\r\nopening of the present unholy War upon our Government; that, witnessing\r\nit, from the Capital of his State, as his highest and best position, he\r\nhad sent forth a War-cry worthy of that Douglass, who, as ancient\r\nlegends tell, with the welcome of the knightly Andalusian King, was\r\ntold,\r\n\r\n               '\"Take thou the leading of the van,\r\n               And charge the Moors amain;\r\n               There is not such a lance as thine\r\n               In all the hosts of Spain.'\r\n\r\n\"Those trumpet notes, with a continuous swell, are sounding still\r\nthroughout all the borders of our Land.  I heard them upon the mountains\r\nand in the valleys of the far State whence I come.  They have\r\ncommunicated faith and strength to millions.  * * *  I ceased to grieve\r\nfor Douglas.  The last voice of the dead Douglas I felt to be stronger\r\nthan the voice of multitudes of living men.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here it may not be considered out of place for a brief reference to\r\nthe writer's own position at this time; especially as it has been much\r\nmisapprehended and misstated.  One of the fairest of these statements*\r\nruns thus:\r\n\r\n     [Lusk's History of the Politics of Illinois from 1856 to 1884, p.\r\n     175.]\r\n\r\n\"It is said that Logan did not approve the great speech made by Senator\r\nDouglas, at Springfield, in April, 1861, wherein he took the bold ground\r\nthat in the contest which was then clearly imminent to him, between the\r\nNorth and the South, that there could be but two parties, Patriots and\r\nTraitors.  But granting that there was a difference between Douglas and\r\nLogan at that time, it did not relate to their adhesion to the Cause of\r\ntheir Country Logan had fought for the Union upon the plains of Mexico,\r\nand again stood ready to give his life, if need be, for his Country,\r\neven amid the cowardly slanders that were then following his pathway.\r\n\r\n\"The difference between Douglas and Logan was this: Mr. Douglas was\r\nfresh from an extended campaign in the dissatisfied Sections of the\r\nSouthern States, and he was fully apprised of their intention to attempt\r\nthe overthrow of the Union, and was therefore in favor of the most\r\nstupendous preparations for War.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Logan, on the other hand, believed in exhausting all peaceable\r\nmeans before a resort to Arms, and in this he was like President\r\nLincoln; but when he saw there was no alternative but to fight, he was\r\nready and willing for armed resistance, and, resigning his seat in\r\nCongress, entered the Army, as Colonel of the Thirty-first Illinois\r\nInfantry, and remained in the field in active service until Peace was\r\ndeclared.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement is, in the main, both fair and correct.\r\n\r\nIt is no more correct, however, in intimating that \"Logan did not\r\napprove the great speech made by Senator Douglas, at Springfield, in\r\nApril, 1861, wherein he took the bold ground that in the contest which\r\nwas then clearly imminent to him, between the North and the South, that\r\nthere could be but two parties, Patriots and Traitors,\" than others have\r\nbeen in intimating that he was disloyal to the Union, prior to the\r\nbreaking out of hostilities--a charge which was laid out flat in the\r\nSenate Chamber, April 19, 1881.\r\n\r\n     [In Dawson's Life of Logan, pp. 348-353, this matter is thus\r\n     alluded to:\r\n\r\n     \"In an early part of this work the base charge that Logan was not\r\n     loyal before the War has been briefly touched on.  It may be well\r\n     here to touch on it more fully.  As was then remarked, the only man\r\n     that ever dared insinuate to Logan's face that he was a Secession\r\n     sympathizer before the War, was Senator Ben Hill of Georgia, in the\r\n     United States Senate Chamber, March 30, 1881; and Logan instantly\r\n     retorted: 'Any man who insinuates that I sympathized with it at\r\n     that time insinuates what is false,' and Senator Hill at once\r\n     retracted the insinuation.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Subsequently, April 19, 1881, Senator Logan, in a speech,\r\n     fortified with indisputable record and documentary evidence,\r\n     forever set at rest the atrocious calumny.  From that record it\r\n     appears that on the 17th December, 1860, while still a Douglas\r\n     Democrat, immediately after Lincoln's election, and long before his\r\n     inauguration, and before even the first gun of the war was fired,\r\n     Mr. Logan, then a Representative in the House, voted affirmatively\r\n     on a resolution, offered by Morris of Illinois, which declared an\r\n     'immovable attachment' to 'our National Union,' and 'that it is our\r\n     patriotic duty to stand by it as our hope in peace and our defense\r\n     in war;' that on the 7th January, 1861, Mr. Adrian having offered\r\n     the following 'Resolved, That we fully approve of the bold and\r\n     patriotic act of Major Anderson in withdrawing from Fort Moultrie\r\n     to Fort Sumter, and of the determination of the President to\r\n     maintain that fearless officer in his present position; and that we\r\n     will support the President in all constitutional measures to\r\n     enforce the laws and preserve the Union'--Mr. Logan, in casting his\r\n     vote, said: 'As the resolution receives my unqualified approval, I\r\n     vote Aye;' and that further on the 5th of February, 1861, before\r\n     the inauguration of President Lincoln, in a speech made by Logan in\r\n     the House in favor of the Crittenden Compromise measures, he used\r\n     the following language touching Secession:\r\n\r\n     \"'Sir, I have always denied, and do yet deny, the right of\r\n     Secession.  There is no warrant for it in the Constitution.  It is\r\n     wrong, it is unlawful, unconstitutional, and should be called by\r\n     the right name--revolution.  No good, sir, can result from it, but\r\n     much mischief may.  It is no remedy for any grievances.  I hold\r\n     that all grievances can be much easier redressed inside the Union\r\n     than out of it.'\r\n\r\n     \"In that same speech he also * * * said:\r\n\r\n     \"'I have been taught that the preservation of this glorious Union,\r\n     with its broad flag waving over us as the shield for our protection\r\n     on land and on sea, is paramount to all the parties and platforms\r\n     that ever have existed or ever can exist.  I would, to day, if I\r\n     had the power, sink my own party and every other one, with all\r\n     their platforms, into the vortex of ruin, without heaving a sigh or\r\n     shedding a tear, to save the Union, or even stop the revolution\r\n     where it is.'\r\n\r\n     \"In this most complete speech of vindication--which Senator Logan\r\n     said he put upon record, 'First, that my children, after me, may\r\n     not have these slanders thrown in their faces without the power of\r\n     dispelling or refuting them; and second, that they may endure in\r\n     this Senate Chamber, so that it may be a notice to Senators of all\r\n     parties and all creeds that hereafter, while I am here in the\r\n     Senate, no insinuation of that kind will be submitted to by me,'\r\n     --the proofs of the falsity of the charge were piled mountain-high,\r\n     and among them the following voluntary statements from two\r\n     Democratic Senators, who were with him before the War, in the House\r\n     of Representatives:\r\n\r\n                    \"'United States Senate Chamber,\r\n                         WASHINGTON, April 14, 1881.\r\n\r\n     \"'DEAR SIR: In a discussion in the Senate a few weeks since you\r\n     referred to the fact that a Southern Senator, who had served with\r\n     you in Congress before the War, could testify that during your term\r\n     of service there you gave no encouragement to the Secession of the\r\n     Southern States, adding, however, that you did not ask such\r\n     testimony.

We had occasion to feel his\r\n     power, and we learned to respect him.'\r\n\r\n     \"Senator Beck, of Kentucky (Democrat), referring to the fact that\r\n     he was kept out of the House at one time, and a great many\r\n     suggestions had been made to him as to General Logan, continued:\r\n\r\n     \"'As I said the other day, I never proposed to go into such things,\r\n     and never have done so; but at that time General Frank Blair was\r\n     here, and I submitted many of the papers I received to him,--I\r\n     never thought of using any of them,--and I remember the remark that\r\n     he made to me: Beck, John Logan was one of the hardest fighters of\r\n     the war; and when many men who were seeking to whistle him down the\r\n     wind because of his politics when the war began, were snugly fixed\r\n     in safe places, he was taking his life in his hand wherever the\r\n     danger was greatest--and I tore up every paper I got, and burnt it\r\n     in the fire before his eyes.'\r\n\r\n     \"Senator Dawes of Massachusetts (Republican), also took occasion to\r\n     say:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. President, I do not know that anything which can be said on\r\n     this side would be of any consequence to the Senator from Illinois\r\n     in this matter.  But I came into the House of Representatives at\r\n     the same session that the Senator did.\r\n\r\n     \"'He was at that time one of the most intense of Democrats, and I\r\n     was there with him when the Rebellion first took root and\r\n     manifested itself in open and flagrant war; and I wish to say as a\r\n     Republican of that day, when the Senator from Illinois was a\r\n     Democrat, that at the earliest possible moment when the Republican\r\n     Party was in anxiety as to the position of the Northern Democracy\r\n     on the question of forcible assault on the Union, nothing did they\r\n     hail with more delight than the early stand which the Senator from\r\n     Illinois, from the Democratic side of the House, took upon the\r\n     question of resistance to the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"I feel that it is right that I should state that he was among the\r\n     first, if not the very first, of the Northern Democrats who came\r\n     out openly and declared, whatever may have been their opinion about\r\n     the doctrines of the Republican Party, that when it came to a\r\n     question of forcible resistance, they should be counted on the side\r\n     of the Government, and in co-operation with the Republican Party in\r\n     the attempt to maintain its authority.'\r\n\r\n     \"'I am very glad, whether it be of any service or not, to bear this\r\n     testimony to the early stand the Senator from Illinois took while\r\n     he was still a Democrat, and the large influence he exerted upon\r\n     the Northern Democracy, which kept it from being involved in the\r\n     condition and in the work of the Southern Democracy at that\r\n     time.'\"]\r\n\r\nSo far from this being the case, the fact is--and it is here mentioned\r\nin part to bring out the interesting point that, had he lived, Douglas\r\nwould have been no idle spectator of the great War that was about to be\r\nwaged--that when Douglas visited Springfield, Illinois, to make that\r\ngreat speech in the latter part of April, 1861, the writer went there\r\nalso, to see and talk over with him the grave situation of affairs, not\r\nonly in the Nation generally, but particularly in Illinois.  And on that\r\noccasion Mr. Douglas said to him, substantially: \"The time has now\r\narrived when a man must be either for or against his Country.  Indeed so\r\nstrongly do I feel this, and that further dalliance with this question\r\nis useless, that I shall myself take steps to join the Array, and fight\r\nfor the maintenance of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the writer replied that he was \"equally well convinced that each\r\nand every man must take his stand,\" and that he also \"purposed at an\r\nearly day to raise a Regiment and draw the sword in that Union's\r\ndefense.\"\r\n\r\nThis was after Sumter, and only seventy days before Congress was to meet\r\nin Called Session.  When that session met, Douglas had, weeks before,\r\ngone down to the grave amid the tears of a distracted Nation, with the\r\nsolemn injunction upon his dying lips: \"Obey the Laws and Defend the\r\nConstitution\"--and the writer had returned to Washington, to take his\r\nseat in Congress, with that determination still alive in his heart.\r\n\r\nIn fact there had been all along, substantial accord between Mr. Douglas\r\nand the writer.  There really was no \"difference between Douglas and\r\nLogan\" as to \"preparations for War,\" or in \"exhausting all Peaceable\r\nmeans before a resort to Arms,\" and both were in full accord with\r\nPresident Lincoln on these points.\r\n\r\nLet us see if this is not of record: Take the writer's speech in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, February 5, 1861, and it will be seen that he\r\nsaid: \"I will go as far as any man in the performance of a\r\nConstitutional duty to put down Rebellion, to suppress Insurrection, and\r\nto enforce the Laws.\"  Again, he said, \"If all the evils and calamities\r\nthat have ever happened since the World began, could be gathered in one\r\nGreat Catastrophe, its horrors could not eclipse, in their frightful\r\nproportions, the Drama that impends over us.\"\r\n\r\nFrom these extracts it is plain enough that even at this very early day\r\nthe writer fully understood the \"frightful proportions\" of the impending\r\nstruggle, and would \"go as far as\"--not only Mr. Douglas, but--\"any man,\r\nto put down Rebellion\"--which necessarily involved War, and\r\n\"preparations for War.\"  But none the less, but rather the more, because\r\nof the horrors which he foresaw must be inseparable from so terrible a\r\nWar, was he anxious by timely mutual Concessions--\"by any sacrifice,\" as\r\nhe termed it--if possible, to avert it.\r\n\r\nHe was ready to sink Party, self, and to accept any of the Propositions\r\nto that end--Mr. Douglas's among them.\r\n\r\n     [See his speech of February 5, 1861, Congressional Globe]\r\n\r\nIn this attitude also he was in accord with Mr. Douglas, who, as well as\r\nthe writer, was ready to make any sacrifice, of Party or self; to\r\n\"exhaust every effort at peaceful adjustment,\" before resorting to War.\r\nThe fact is they were much of the time in consultation, and always in\r\nsubstantial accord.\r\n\r\nIn a speech made in the Senate, March 15, 1861, Mr. Douglas had reduced\r\nthe situation to the following three alternative points:\r\n\r\n\"1. THE RESTORATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE UNION by such Amendments to\r\nthe Constitution as will insure the domestic tranquillity, safety, and\r\nequality of all the States, and thus restore peace, unity, and\r\nfraternity, to the whole Country.\r\n\r\n\"2. A PEACEFUL DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION by recognizing the Independence\r\nof such States as refuse to remain in the Union without such\r\nConstitutional Amendments, and the establishment of a liberal system of\r\ncommercial and social intercourse with them by treaties of commerce and\r\namity.\r\n\r\n\"3. WAR, with a view to the subjugation and military occupation of those\r\nStates which have Seceded or may Secede from the Union.\"\r\n\r\nAs a thorough Union man, he could never have agreed to a \"Peaceful\r\nDissolution of the Union.\"  On the other hand he was equally averse to\r\nWar, because he held that \"War is Disunion.  War is final, eternal\r\nSeparation.\"  Hence, all his energies and talents were given to carrying\r\nout his first-stated line of policy, and to persuading the Seceders to\r\naccept what in that line was offered to them by the dominant party.\r\n\r\nHis speech in the Senate, March 25, 1861, was a remarkable effort in\r\nthat respect.  Mr. Breckinridge had previously spoken, and had declared\r\nthat: \"Whatever settlement may be made of other questions, this must be\r\nsettled upon terms that will give them [the Southern States] either a\r\nright, in common with others, to emigrate into all the territory, or\r\nwill secure to them their rights on a principle of equitable division.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas replied: \"Now, under the laws as they stand, in every\r\nTerritory of the United States, without any exception, a Southern man\r\ncan go with his Slave-property on equal terms with all other property.\r\n* * *  Every man, either from the North or South, may go into the\r\nTerritories with his property on terms of exact equality, subject to the\r\nlocal law; and Slave-property stands on an equal footing with all other\r\nkinds of property in the Territories of the United States.  It now\r\nstands on an equal footing in all the Territories for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"I have shown you that, up to 1859, little more than a year ago, it was\r\nprohibited in part of the Territories.  It is not prohibited anywhere\r\nnow.  For the first time, under Republican rule, the Southern States\r\nhave secured that equality of rights in the Territories for their\r\nSlave-property which they have been demanding so long.\"\r\n\r\nHe held that the doctrine of Congressional prohibition in all the\r\nTerritories, as incorporated in the Wilmot proviso, had now been\r\nrepudiated by the Republicans of both Houses of Congress, who had \"all\r\ncome over to Non-intervention and Popular Sovereignty;\" that the \"Wilmot\r\nproviso is given up; that Congressional prohibition is given up; that\r\nthe aggressive policy is repudiated; and hereafter the Southern man and\r\nthe Northern man may move into the Territories with their Property on\r\nterms of entire equality, without excepting Slaves or any other kind of\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\nContinuing, he said: \"What more do the Southern States want?  What more\r\ncan any man demand?  Non-intervention is all you asked.  Will it be said\r\nthe South required in addition to this, laws of Congress to protect\r\nSlavery in the Territories?  That cannot be said; for only last May, the\r\nSenate, by a nearly unanimous vote--a unanimous vote of the Southern\r\nmen, with one or two exceptions--declared that affirmative legislation\r\nwas not needed at this time.  * * * What cause is there for further\r\nalarm in the Southern States, so far as the Territories are concerned?\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\"I repeat, the South has got all they ever claimed in all the\r\nTerritories.  * * *  Then, sir, according to law, the Slaveholding\r\nStates have got equality in the Territories.  How is it in fact.  * * *\r\nNow, I propose to show that they have got the actual equitable\r\npartition, giving them more than they were disposed to demand.\r\n\r\n\"The Senator from Kentucky, * * *  Mr. Crittenden, introduced a\r\nproposition for an equitable partition.  That proposition was, that\r\nnorth of 36  30' Slavery should be prohibited, and South of it should be\r\nprotected, by Territorial law.  * * *  What is now the case?  It is true\r\nthe Crittenden proposition has not yet become part of the Constitution;\r\nbut it is also true that an equitable partition has been made by the\r\nvote of the people themselves, establishing, maintaining, and protecting\r\nSlavery in every inch of territory South of the thirty-seventh parallel,\r\ngiving the South half a degree more than the Crittenden Proposition.\r\n\r\n\"There stands your Slave-code in New Mexico protecting Slavery up to the\r\nthirty-seventh degree as effectually as laws can be made to protect it.\r\nThere it stands the Law of the Land.  Therefore the South has all below\r\nthe thirty-seventh parallel, while Congress has not prohibited Slavery\r\neven North of it.\r\n\r\n                    *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"What more, then, is demanded?  Simply that a Constitutional Amendment\r\nshall be adopted, affirming--what?  Precisely what every Republican in\r\nboth Houses of Congress has voted for within a month.  Just do, by\r\nConstitutional Amendment, what you have voted in the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, that is all.  You are not even required to do that, but\r\nmerely to vote for a proposition submitting the question to the People\r\nof the States whether they will make a Constitutional Amendment\r\naffirming the equitable partition of the Territories which the People\r\nhave already made.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"You may ask, why does the South want us to do it by Constitutional\r\nAmendment, when we have just done it voluntarily by Law?  The President\r\nof the United States, in his Inaugural, has told you the reason.  He has\r\ninformed you that all of these troubles grow out of the absence of a\r\nConstitutional provision defining the power of Congress over the subject\r\nof Slavery.  * * *  He thinks that the trouble has arisen from the\r\nabsence of such a Constitutional Provision, and suggests a National\r\nConvention to enable the People to supply the defect, leaving the People\r\nto say what it is, instead of dictating to them what it shall be.\"\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked that while Mr. Douglas held that \"So far as the\r\ndoctrine of Popular Sovereignty and Nonintervention is concerned, the\r\nColorado Bill, the Nevada Bill, and the Dakota Bill, are identically the\r\nsame with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, and in its precise language\"--these\r\nformer Bills having been passed at the last Session of the 36th\r\nCongress--the Republicans, on the contrary, held that neither in these\r\nnor other measures had they abandoned any distinctive Republican\r\nprinciple; while Breckinridge declared that they had passed those\r\nTerritorial Bills, without the Wilmot proviso, because they felt\r\nperfectly secure in those Territories, with all the Federal patronage in\r\nRepublican hands.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, we have here, brought out in strong contrast, the\r\nconciliatory feeling which inspired such Union men as Douglas, and the\r\nstrong and persistent efforts they made in behalf of Concession and\r\nPeace up to a period only a few weeks before the bombardment of Sumter;\r\nand the almost total revulsion in their sentiments after that event, as\r\nto the only proper means to preserve the Union.  For it was only then\r\nthat the truth, as it fell from Douglas's lips at Springfield, was fully\r\nrecognized, to wit: that there was no half-way ground betwixt Patriotism\r\nand Treason; that War was an existing fact; and that Patriots must arm\r\nto defend and preserve the Union against the armed Traitors assailing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAt last, July 4, 1861, the Congress met, and proceeded at once with\r\ncommendable alacrity and patriotism, to the consideration and enactment\r\nof measures sufficient to meet the extraordinary exigency, whether as\r\nregards the raising and equipment of the vast bodies of Union volunteers\r\nneeded to put down Rebellion, or in the raising of those enormous\r\namounts of money which the Government was now, or might thereafter be,\r\ncalled upon to spend like water in preserving the Union.\r\n\r\nIt was at this memorable Session, of little over one month, that the\r\nchief of the great \"War Measures\" as they were termed, were enacted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                          THE STORM OF BATTLE\r\n\r\nWe have seen how Fort Sumter fell; how the patriotic North responded to\r\nPresident Lincoln's Call, for 75,000 three-months volunteers, with such\r\nenthusiasm that, had there been a sufficiency of arms and accoutrements,\r\nhe might have had, within three months of that Call, an Army of 500,000\r\nmen in the field; how he had called for 42,000 three-years volunteers\r\nearly in May, besides swelling what little there was of a regular Army\r\nby ten full regiments; and how a strict blockade of the entire Southern\r\nCoast-line had not only been declared, but was now enforced and\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler, promoted Major-General for his Military successes at\r\nAnnapolis and Baltimore, was now in command of Fortress Monroe and\r\nvicinity, with some 12,000 volunteers under him, confronted, on the\r\nPeninsula, by a nearly equal number of Rebel troops, under Generals\r\nHuger and Magruder--General Banks, with less than 10,000 Union troops,\r\noccupying Baltimore, and its vicinage.\r\n\r\nGeneral Patterson, with some 20,000 Union troops--mostly Pennsylvania\r\nmilitia--was at Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, with about an equal number\r\nof the Enemy, under General Joseph E. Johnston, at Harper's Ferry, on\r\nthe Potomac, watching him.\r\n\r\nSome 50,000 Union troops were in camp, in and about Washington, on the\r\nVirginia side, under the immediate command of Generals McDowell and\r\nMansfield--Lieutenant General Scott, at Washington, being in\r\nChief-command of the Union Armies--and, confronting these Union forces,\r\nin Virginia, near the National Capital, were some 30,000 Rebel troops\r\nunder the command of General Beauregard, whose success in securing the\r\nevacuation of Fort Sumter by its little garrison of half-starved Union\r\nsoldiers, had magnified him, in the eyes of the rebellious South, into\r\nthe proportions of a Military genius of the first order.\r\n\r\nThere had been no fighting, nor movements, worthy of special note, until\r\nJune 7th, when General Patterson advanced from Chambersburg,\r\nPennsylvania, to Hagerstown, Maryland.  General Johnston at once\r\nevacuated Harper's Ferry, and retreated upon Winchester, Virginia.\r\n\r\nGeneral McClellan, in command of the Department of the Ohio, had,\r\nhowever, crossed the Ohio river, and by the 4th of July, being at\r\nGrafton, West Virginia, with his small Army of Union troops, to which a\r\ngreatly inferior Rebel force was opposed, commenced that successful\r\nadvance against it, which led, after Bull Run, to his being placed at\r\nthe head of all the Armies of the United States.\r\n\r\nSubsequently Patterson crossed the Potomac, and after trifling away over\r\none month's time, at last, on the 15th of July, got within nine miles of\r\nWinchester and Johnston's Army.  Barring a spiritless reconnaissance,\r\nPatterson--who was a fervent Breckinridge-Democrat in politics, and\r\nwhose Military judgment, as we shall see, was greatly influenced, if not\r\nentirely controlled, by his Chief of staff, Fitz John Porter--never got\r\nany nearer to the Enemy!\r\n\r\nInstead of attacking the Rebel force, under Johnston, or at least\r\nkeeping it \"employed,\" as he was ordered to do by General Scott; instead\r\nof getting nearer, and attempting to get between Winchester and the\r\nShenandoah River, as was suggested to him by his second in command,\r\nGeneral Sanford; and instead of permitting Sanford to go ahead, as that\r\nGeneral desired to, with his own 8,000 men, and do it himself; General\r\nPatterson ordered him off to Charlestown--twelve miles to the Union left\r\nand rear,--and then took the balance of his Army, with himself, to the\r\nsame place!\r\n\r\nIn other words, while he had the most positive and definite orders, from\r\nGeneral Scott, if not to attack and whip Johnston, to at least keep him\r\nbusy and prevent that Rebel General from forming a junction, via the\r\nManassas Gap railroad or otherwise, with Beauregard, Patterson\r\ndeliberately moved his Army further away from Winchester and gave to the\r\nEnemy the very chance of escaping and forming that junction which was\r\nessential to Rebel success in the vicinity of Manassas.\r\n\r\nBut for this disobedience of orders, Bull Run would doubtless have been\r\na great victory to the Union Arms, instead of a reverse, and the War,\r\nwhich afterward lasted four years, might have been over in as many\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIt is foreign to the design of this work, to present in it detailed\r\ndescriptions of the battles waged during the great War of the Rebellion\r\n--it being the present intention of the writer, at some later day, to\r\nprepare and publish another work devoted to such stirring Military\r\nscenes.  Yet, as it might seem strange and unaccountable for him to pass\r\nby, at this time, without any description or comment, the first pitched\r\nbattle of the Rebellion, he is constrained to pause and view that\r\nmemorable contest.  And first, it may be well to say a word of the\r\ngeneral topography of the country about the battle-field.\r\n\r\nThe Alleghany Mountains, or that part of them with which we have now to\r\ndo, stretch in three almost equidistant parallel ridges, from North-East\r\nto South-West, through the heart of Old Virginia.  An occasional pass,\r\nor \"Gap,\" through these ridges, affords communication, by good roads,\r\nbetween the enclosed parallel valleys and the Eastern part of that\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe Western of these Alleghany ridges bears the name of \"Alleghany\r\nMountains\" proper; the Eastern is called the \"Blue Ridge;\" while the\r\nMiddle Ridge, at its Northern end--which rests upon the Potomac, where\r\nthat river sweeps through three parallel ridges almost at right angles\r\nto their own line of direction--is called the \"Great North Mountain.\"\r\n\r\nThe valley, between the Middle Ridge and the Blue Ridge, is known as the\r\nShenandoah Valley, taking its name from the Shenandoah River, which, for\r\nmore than one hundred miles, flows along the Western foot of the Blue\r\nRidge, toward the North-East, until it empties into the Potomac, at\r\nHarper's Ferry.\r\n\r\nThe Orange and Alexandria railroad runs from Alexandria,--on the\r\nopposite bank of the Potomac from Washington, and a few miles below\r\nthe Capital,--in a general Southeasterly direction, to Culpepper\r\nCourt-House; thence Southerly to Gordonsville, where it joins the\r\nVirginia Central--the Western branch of which runs thence through\r\nCharlotteville, Staunton, and Covington, across the ridges and valleys\r\nof the Alleghanies, while its Eastern branch, taking a general\r\nSouth-easterly direction, crosses the Richmond and Fredricksburg\r\nrailroad at Hanover Junction, some twenty miles North of Richmond,\r\nand thence sweeps Southerly to the Rebel capital.\r\n\r\nIt is along this Easterly branch of the Virginia Central that Rebel\r\nre-enforcements will be hurried to Beauregard, from Richmond to\r\nGordonsville, and thence, by the Orange and Alexandria railroad, to\r\nManassas Junction.\r\n\r\nSome twenty-five miles from Alexandria, a short railroad-feeder--which\r\nruns from Strasburg, in the Shenandoah Valley, through the Blue Ridge,\r\nat Manassas Gap, in an East-South-easterly direction--strikes the\r\nAlexandria and Orange railroad.  The point of contact is Manassas\r\nJunction; and it is along this Manassas-Gap feeder that Johnston, with\r\nhis Army at Winchester--some twenty miles North-North-East of Strasburg\r\n--expects, in case of attack by Patterson, to be re-enforced by\r\nBeauregard; or, in case the latter is assailed, to go to his assistance,\r\nafter shaking off Patterson.\r\n\r\nThis little link of railroad, known as the Manassas Gap railroad, is\r\ntherefore an important factor in the game of War, now commencing in\r\nearnest; and it had, as we shall see, very much to do, not only with the\r\nadvance of McDowell's Union Army upon Bull Run, but also with the result\r\nof the first pitched battle thereabout fought.\r\n\r\nFrom Alexandria, some twelve miles to the Westward, runs a fine turnpike\r\nroad to Fairfax Court-House; thence, continuing Westward, but gradually\r\nand slightly dipping award the South, it passes through Germantown,\r\nCentreville, and Groveton, to Warrenton.\r\n\r\nThis \"Warrenton Pike\"--as it is termed--also plays a somewhat\r\nconspicuous part, before, during, and after the Battle of Bull Run.  For\r\nmost of its length, from Fairfax Court-House to Warrenton, the Warrenton\r\nPike pursues a course almost parallel with the Orange and Alexandria\r\nrailroad aforesaid, while the stream of Bull Run, pursuing a\r\nSouth-easterly course, has a general direction almost parallel with\r\nthat of the Manassas Gap railroad.\r\n\r\nWe shall find that it is the diamond-shaped parallelogram, formed by the\r\nobtuse angle junction of the two railroads on the South, and the\r\nsimilarly obtuse-angled crossing of the stream of Bull Run by the\r\nWarrenton Pike on the North, that is destined to become the historic\r\nbattle-field of the first \"Bull Run,\" or \"Manassas;\" and it is in the\r\nNorthern obtuse-angle of this parallelogram that the main fighting is\r\ndone, upon a spot not much more than one mile square, three sides of the\r\nsame being bounded respectively by the Bull Run stream, the Warrenton\r\nPike, which crosses it on a stone bridge, and the Sudley Springs road,\r\nwhich crosses the Pike, at right-angles to it, near a stone house.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of June, 1861, General McDowell, in command of the Department\r\nof North-Eastern Virginia, with head-quarters at Arlington, near\r\nWashington, receives from Colonel Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General\r\nwith Lieutenant-General Scott--who is in Chief command of all the Union\r\nForces, with Headquarters at Washington--a brief but pregnant\r\ncommunication, the body of which runs thus: \"General Scott desires you\r\nto submit an estimate of the number and composition of a column to be\r\npushed toward Manassas Junction, and perhaps the Gap, say in four or\r\nfive days, to favor Patterson's attack on Harper's Ferry.  The rumor is\r\nthat Arlington Heights will be attacked to-night.\"\r\n\r\nIn response to this request, General McDowell submits, on the day\r\nfollowing, an estimate that \"the actual entire force at the head of the\r\ncolumn should, for the purpose of carrying the position at Manassas and\r\nof occupying both the road to Culpepper, and the one to the Gap, be as\r\nmuch as 12,000 Infantry, two batteries of regular Artillery, and from\r\nsix to eight companies of Cavalry, with an available reserve, ready to\r\nmove forward from Alexandria by rail, of 5,000 Infantry and one heavy\r\nfield battery, rifled if possible; these numbers to be increased or\r\ndiminished as events may indicate.\"  This force of raw troops he\r\nproposes to organize into field brigades under the command of \"active\r\nand experienced colonels\" of the regular Army.  And while giving this\r\nestimate as to the number of troops necessary, he suggestively adds that\r\n\"in proportion to the numbers used will be the lives saved; and as we\r\nhave such numbers pressing to be allowed to serve, might it not be well\r\nto overwhelm and conquer as much by the show of force as by the use of\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently McDowell presents to General Scott, and Mr. Lincoln's\r\nCabinet, a project of advance and attack, which is duly approved and\r\nordered to be put in execution.  In that project or plan of operations,\r\nsubmitted by verbal request of General Scott, near the end of June,--the\r\nsuccess of which is made contingent upon Patterson's holding Johnston\r\nengaged at Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley, and also upon Butler's\r\nholding the Rebel force near Fortress Monroe from coming to Beauregard's\r\naid at Manassas Junction,--McDowell estimates Beauregard's strength at\r\n25,000, with a possible increase, bringing it up to 35,000 men.  The\r\nobjective point in McDowell's plan, is Manassas Junction, and he\r\nproposes \"to move against Manassas with a force of 30,000 of all arms,\r\norganized into three columns, with a reserve of 10,000.\"\r\n\r\nMcDowell is fully aware that the Enemy has \"batteries in position at\r\nseveral places in his front, and defensive works on Bull Run, and\r\nManassas Junction.\"  These batteries he proposes to turn.  He believes\r\nBull Run to be \"fordable at almost anyplace,\"--an error which ultimately\r\nrenders his plan abortive,--and his proposition is, after uniting his\r\ncolumns on the Eastern side of Bull Run, \"to attack the main position by\r\nturning it, if possible, so as to cut off communications by rail with\r\nthe South, or threaten to do so sufficiently to force the Enemy to leave\r\nhis intrenchments to guard them.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, assuming the Enemy driven back, by minor flanking\r\nmovements, or otherwise, upon his intrenched position at Bull Run, or\r\nManassas, the plan is to turn his right, destroy the Orange and\r\nAlexandria railroad leading South, and the bridge at Bristol, so as to\r\ncut off his supplies.  This done, the Enemy--if nothing worse ensues for\r\nhim--will be in a \"bad box.\"\r\n\r\nMcDowell, however, has no idea that the Enemy will stand still to let\r\nthis thing be done.  On the contrary, he is well satisfied that\r\nBeauregard will accept battle on some chosen ground between Manassas\r\nJunction and Washington.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of Tuesday, the 16th of July, the advance of McDowell's\r\nArmy commences.  That Army is organized into five divisions--four of\r\nwhich accompany McDowell, while a fifth is left to protect the defensive\r\nworks of Washington, on the South bank of the Potomac.  This latter, the\r\nFourth Division, commanded by Brigadier-General Theodore Runyon,\r\ncomprises eight unbrigaded New Jersey regiments of (three months, and\r\nthree years) volunteers--none of which take part in the ensuing\r\nconflicts-at-arms.\r\n\r\nThe moving column consists of the First Division, commanded by\r\nBrigadier-General Daniel Tyler, comprising four brigades, respectively\r\nunder Brigadier-General R.  C. Schenck, and Colonels E. D. Keyes, W. T.\r\nSherman, and I. B. Richardson; the Second Division, commanded by Colonel\r\nDavid Hunter, comprising two brigades, under Colonels Andrew Porter and\r\nA. E. Burnside respectively; the Third Division, commanded by Colonel S.\r\nP. Heintzelman, comprising three brigades, under Colonels W. B.\r\nFranklin, O. B. Wilcox, and O. O. Howard, respectively; and the Fifth\r\nDivision, commanded by Colonel Dixon S. Miles, comprising two brigades,\r\nunder Colonels Lewis Blenker, and Thomas A.  Davies, respectively.\r\n\r\nTyler's Division leads the advance, moving along the Leesburg road to\r\nVienna, on our right, with orders to cross sharply to its left, upon\r\nFairfax Court House, the following (Wednesday) morning.  Miles's\r\nDivision follows the turnpike road to Annandale, and then moves, by the\r\nBraddock road,--along which Braddock, a century before, had marched his\r\ndoomed army to disaster,--upon Fairfax Court House, then known to be\r\nheld by Bonham's Rebel Brigade of South Carolinians.  Hunter follows\r\nMiles, to Annandale, and thence advances direct upon Fairfax, by the\r\nturnpike road--McDowell's idea being to bag Bonham's Brigade, if\r\npossible, by a simultaneous attack on the front and both flanks.  But\r\nthe advance is too slow, and the Enemy's outposts, both there and\r\nelsewhere, have ample opportunity of falling safely back upon their main\r\nposition, behind the stream of Bull Run.\r\n\r\n     [McDowell in his testimony before the \"Committee on the Conduct of\r\n     the War,\" said: \"At Fairfax Court House was the South Carolina\r\n     Brigade.  And I do not suppose anything would have had a greater\r\n     cheering effect upon the troops, and perhaps upon the Country, than\r\n     the capture of that brigade.  And if General Tyler could have got\r\n     down there any time in the forenoon instead of in the afternoon,\r\n     the capture of that brigade was beyond question.  It was about\r\n     5,000 or 6,000 men, and Tyler had 12,000, at the same time that we\r\n     were pressing on in front.  He did not get down there until in the\r\n     afternoon; none of us got forward in time.\"]\r\n\r\nThis slowness is due to various causes.  There is a pretty general\r\ndread, for example, among our troops, of threatened ambuscades, and\r\nhence the advance is more cautious than it otherwise would be.  It is\r\nthought the part of wisdom, as it were, to \"feel the way.\"  The\r\nmarching, moreover, is new to our troops.  General Scott had checked\r\nMcDowell when the latter undertook to handle eight regiments together,\r\nnear Washington, by intimating that he was \"trying to make a show.\"\r\nThus the very essential knowledge of how to manoeuvre troops in large\r\nbodies, has been withheld from our Union generals, while the volunteer\r\nregiments have either rusted in camp from inaction, or have been denied\r\nthe opportunity of acquiring that endurance and hardiness and discipline\r\nwhich frequent movement of troops confers.  Hence, all unused to the\r\ndiscipline of the march, every moment some one falls out of line to\r\n\"pick blackberries, or to get water.\"  Says McDowell, in afterward\r\nreporting this march: \"They would not keep in the ranks, order as much\r\nas you pleased.  When they came where water was fresh, they would pour\r\nthe old water out of their canteens and fill them with fresh water; they\r\nwere not used to denying themselves much.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, Heintzelman's Division is also advancing, by cross-roads, more\r\nto the left and South of the railroad line,--in accordance with\r\nMcDowell's plan, which comprehends not only the bagging of Bonham, but\r\nan immediate subsequent demonstration, by Tyler, upon Centreville and\r\nbeyond, while Heintzelman, supported by Hunter and Miles, shall swoop\r\nacross Bull Run, at Wolf Run Shoals, some distance below Union Mills,\r\nturn the Enemy's right, and cut off his Southern line of railroad\r\ncommunications.  Thus, by the evening of Wednesday, the 17th,\r\nHeintzelman is at Sangster's Station, while Tyler, Miles, and Hunter,\r\nare at Fairfax.\r\n\r\nIt is a rather rough experience that now befalls the Grand Army of the\r\nUnion.  All unused, as we have seen, to the fatigues and other hardships\r\nof the march, the raw levies, of which it almost wholly consists, which\r\nstarted bright and fresh, strong and hopeful, full of the buoyant ardor\r\nof enthusiastic patriotism, on that hot July afternoon, only some thirty\r\nhours back, are now dust-begrimed, footsore, broken down, exhausted by\r\nthe scorching sun, hungry, and without food,--for they have wasted the\r\nrations with which they started, and the supply-trains have not yet\r\narrived.  Thus, hungry and physically prostrated, \"utterly played out,\"\r\nas many of them confess, and demoralized also by straggling and loss of\r\norganization, they bivouac that night in the woods, and dream uneasy\r\ndreams beneath the comfortless stars.\r\n\r\nA mile beyond Fairfax Court House, on the Warrenton Turnpike, is\r\nGermantown.  It is here that Tyler's Division has rested, on the night\r\nof the 17th.  At 7 o'clock on the morning of Thursday, the 18th, in\r\nobedience to written orders from McDowell, it presses forward, on that\r\n\"Pike,\" to Centreville, five miles nearer to the Enemy's position behind\r\nBull Run--Richardson's Brigade in advance--and, at 9 o'clock, occupies\r\nit.  Here McDowell has intended Tyler to remain, in accordance with the\r\nplan, which he has imparted to him in conversation, and in obedience to\r\nthe written instructions to: \"Observe well the roads to Bull Run and to\r\nWarrenton.  Do not bring on an engagement, but keep up the impression\r\nthat we are moving on Manassas,\"--this advance, by way of Centreville,\r\nbeing intended solely as a \"demonstration\" to mask the real movement,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, is to be made by the other divisions across Wolf\r\nRun Shoals, a point on Bull Run, some five or six miles below Union\r\nMills, and some seven miles below Blackburn's Ford.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of Richardson's Brigade, Thursday morning, at\r\nCentreville, it is found that, under cover of the darkness of the\r\nprevious night, the Enemy has retreated, in two bodies, upon Bull Run,\r\nthe one along the Warrenton Pike, the other (the largest) down the\r\nridge-road from Centreville to Blackburn's Ford.  Richardson's Brigade\r\nat once turns down the latter road and halts about a mile beyond\r\nCentreville, at a point convenient to some springs of water.  Tyler soon\r\nafterward rides up, and, taking from that brigade two companies of light\r\nInfantry and a squadron of Cavalry, proceeds, with Colonel Richardson,\r\nto reconnoitre the Enemy, finding him in a strong position on the\r\nopposite bank of Bull Run, at Blackburn's Ford.\r\n\r\nWhile this is going on, McDowell has ridden in a Southerly direction\r\ndown to Heintzelman's Division, at Sangster's Station, \"to make\r\narrangements to turn the Enemy's right, and intercept his communications\r\nwith the South,\" but has found, owing to the narrowness and crookedness\r\nof the roads, and the great distance that must be traversed in making\r\nthe necessary detour, that his contemplated movement is too risky to be\r\nventured.  Hence he at once abandons his original plan of turning the\r\nEnemy's right, and determines on \"going around his left, where the\r\ncountry is more open, and the roads broad and good.\"\r\n\r\nMcDowell now orders a concentration, for that night, of the four\r\ndivisions, with two days cooked rations in their haversacks, upon and\r\nabout Centreville,--the movement to commence as soon as they shall\r\nreceive expected commissariat supplies.  But, later on the 18th,\r\n--learning that his advance, under Tyler, has, against orders, become\r\nengaged with the Enemy--he directs the concentration to be made at once.\r\n\r\nLet us examine, for a moment, how this premature engagement comes about.\r\nWe left Tyler, accompanied by Richardson, with a squadron of Cavalry and\r\na battalion of light Infantry making a reconnaissance, on Thursday\r\nmorning the 18th, toward Blackburn's Ford.  They approach within a mile\r\nof the ford, when they discover a Rebel battery on the farther bank of\r\nBull Run--so placed as to enfilade the road descending from their own\r\nposition of observation down to the ford,--strong Rebel infantry pickets\r\nand skirmishing parties being in front.\r\n\r\nTyler at once orders up his two rifled guns, Ayres' Battery, and\r\nRichardson's entire Brigade--and later, Sherman's Brigade as a reserve.\r\nAs soon as they come up,--about noon-he orders the rifled guns into\r\nbattery on the crest of the hill, about one mile from, and looking down\r\nupon, the Rebel battery aforesaid, and opens upon the Enemy; giving him\r\na dozen shells,--one of them making it lively for a body of Rebel\r\nCavalry which appears between the ford and Manassas.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel battery responds with half a dozen shots, and then ceases.\r\nTyler now orders Richardson to advance his brigade and throw out\r\nskirmishers to scour the thick woods which cover the Bull Run\r\nbottom-land.  Richardson at once rapidly deploys the battalion of light\r\nInfantry as skirmishers in advance of his brigade, pushes them forward\r\nto the edge of the woods, drives in the skirmishers of the Enemy in fine\r\nstyle, and supports their further advance into the woods, with the 1st\r\nMassachusetts Regiment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tyler, discovering a favorable opening in the woods, \"low down\r\non the bottom of the stream,\" for a couple of howitzers in battery,\r\nsends Captain Ayres of the 5th U. S. Artillery, and a detached section\r\n(two 12-pound howitzers) of his battery, with orders to post it himself\r\non that spot, and sends Brackett's squadron of the 2d Cavalry to his\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nNo sooner does Ayres open fire on the Enemy, than he awakens a Rebel\r\nhornet's-nest.  Volley after volley of musketry shows that the Bull Run\r\nbottom fairly swarms with Rebel troops, while another Rebel battery,\r\nmore to the Rebel right, opens, with that already mentioned, a\r\nconcentrated cross-fire upon him.\r\n\r\nAnd now Richardson orders up the 12th New York, Colonel Walrath, to the\r\nleft of our battery.  Forming it into line-of-battle, Richardson orders\r\nit to charge through the woods upon the Enemy.  Gallantly the regiment\r\nmoves forward, after the skirmishers, into the woods, but, being met by\r\na very heavy fire of musketry and artillery along the whole line of the\r\nEnemy's position, is, for the most part, thrown back in confusion--a\r\nmere fragment* remaining in line, and retreating,--while the howitzers,\r\nand Cavalry also, are withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, Richardson has ordered up, and placed in\r\nline-of-battle, on the right of our battery, the 1st Massachusetts, the\r\n2d Michigan (his own), and the 3d Michigan.  The skirmishers in the\r\nwoods still bravely hold their ground, undercover, and these three\r\nregiments are plucky, and anxious to assault the Enemy.  Richardson\r\nproposes to lead them in a charge upon the Enemy's position, and drive\r\nhim out of it; but Tyler declines to give permission, on the ground that\r\nthis being \"merely a reconnaissance,\" the object of which--ascertaining\r\nthe strength and position of the Enemy--having been attained, a further\r\nattack is unnecessary.  He therefore orders Richardson to \"fall back in\r\ngood order to our batteries on the hill,\"--which he does.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching these batteries, Richardson forms his 2d Michigan, in\r\n\"close column by division,\" on their right, and the 1st Massachusetts\r\nand 3d Michigan, in \"line of battle,\" on their left--the 12th New York\r\nre-forming, under cover of the woods at the rear, later on.  Then, with\r\nour skirmishers thrown into the woods in front, their scattering fire,\r\nand the musketry responses of the Rebels, are drowned in the volume of\r\nsound produced by the deafening contest which ensues between our\r\nArtillery, and that of the Enemy from his batteries behind Bull Run.\r\n\r\nThis artillery-duel continues about one hour; and then seems to cease by\r\nmutual consent, about dusk--after 415 shots have been fired on the Union\r\nside, and have been responded to by an equal number from the Rebel\r\nbatteries, \"gun for gun\"--the total loss in the engagement, on the Union\r\nside, being 83, to a total loss among the Enemy, of Thursday night,\r\nRichardson retires his brigade upon Centreville, in order to secure\r\nrations and water for his hungry and thirsty troops,--as no water has\r\nyet been found in the vicinity of the Union batteries aforesaid.  On the\r\nmorrow, however, when his brigade re-occupies that position, water is\r\nfound in abundance, by digging for it.\r\n\r\nThis premature attack, at Blackburn's Ford, by Tyler, against orders,\r\nhaving failed, throws a wet blanket upon the martial spirit of\r\nMcDowell's Army.  In like degree is the morale of the Rebel Army\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Longstreet, in command of the Rebel troops at\r\nBlackburn's Ford, has not had things all his own way; that some of his\r\nartillery had to be \"withdrawn;\" that, as he acknowledges in his report,\r\nhis brigade of three Virginia regiments (the 1st, 11th, and 17th) had\r\n\"with some difficulty repelled\" the Union assault upon his position;\r\nthat he had to call upon General Early for re-enforcements; that Early\r\nre-enforced him with two Infantry regiments (the 7th Louisiana and 7th\r\nVirginia) at first; that one of these (the 7th Virginia) was \"thrown\r\ninto confusion;\" that Early then brought up his own regiment (the 24th\r\nVirginia) under Lieutenant Colonel Hairston, and the entire seven guns\r\nof the \"Washington Artillery;\" and that but for the active \"personal\r\nexertions\" of Longstreet, in \"encouraging the men under his command,\"\r\nand the great numerical superiority of the Rebels, there might have been\r\nno Union \"repulse\" at all.  Yet still the attack has failed, and that\r\nfailure, while it dispirits the Patriot Army, inspires the Rebel Army\r\nwith renewed courage.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Friday, the 19th of July, is devoted to\r\nreconnaissances by the Engineer officers of the Union Army; to the\r\ncooking of the supplies, which have at last arrived; and to resting the\r\nweary and road-worn soldiers of the Union.\r\n\r\nLet us take advantage of this halt in the advance of McDowell's \"Grand\r\nArmy of the United States\"--as it was termed--to view the Rebel position\r\nat, and about Manassas, and to note certain other matters having an\r\nimportant and even determining bearing upon the issue of the impending\r\nshock-at-arms.\r\n\r\nBeauregard has received early information of McDowell's advance from\r\nArlington, and of his plans.\r\n\r\n     [This he admits, in his report, when he says; \"Opportunely informed\r\n     of the determination of the Enemy to advance on Manassas, my\r\n     advanced brigades, on the night of the 16th of July, were made\r\n     aware, from these headquarters, of the impending movement,\"]\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday the 16th, he notifies his advanced brigades.  On Wednesday,\r\nhe sends a dispatch from Manassas, to Jefferson Davis, at Richmond,\r\nannouncing that the Union troops have assailed his outposts in heavy\r\nforce; that he has fallen back before them, on the line of Bull Run; and\r\nthat he intends to make a stand at Mitchell's Ford (close to Blackburn's\r\nFord) on that stream,--adding: if his (McDowell's) force is\r\noverwhelming, \"I shall retire to the Rappahannock railroad bridge,\r\nsaving my command for defense there, and future operations.  Please\r\ninform Johnston of this, via Staunton, and also Holmes.  Send forward\r\nany re-enforcements at the earliest possible instant, and by every\r\npossible means.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, Beauregard loses no time in advantageously\r\nposting his troops.  On the morning of the 18th of July, when the Union\r\nadvance enters Centreville, he has withdrawn all his advanced brigades\r\nwithin the Rebel lines of Bull Run, resting them on the South side of\r\nthat stream, from Union Mills Ford, near the Orange and Alexandria\r\nrailroad bridge, up to the stone bridge over which the Warrenton Pike\r\ncrosses the Run,--a distance of some six to eight miles.\r\n\r\nBetween the Rebel left, at Stone Bridge, and the Rebel right, at Union\r\nMills Ford, are several fords across Bull Run--the general course of the\r\nstream being from the North-West to South-East, to its confluence with\r\nthe Occoquan River, some twelve miles from the Potomac River.\r\n\r\nMitchell's Ford, the Rebel center, is about three miles to the\r\nSouth-West of, and about the same distance North-East from, Manassas\r\nJunction. But it may be well, right here, to locate all these fordable\r\ncrossings of the rocky, precipitous, and well-wooded Bull Run stream,\r\nbetween the Stone Bridge and Union Mills Ford.  Thus, half a mile below\r\nthe Stone Bridge is Lewis's Ford; half a mile below that, Ball's Ford;\r\nhalf a mile below that, Island Ford; one and one-half miles below that,\r\nMitchell's Ford--one mile below that.\r\n\r\nBlackburn's Ford; three-quarters of a mile farther down, McLean's Ford;\r\nand nearly two miles lower down the stream, Union Mills Ford.\r\n\r\nBy Thursday morning, the 18th of July, Beauregard has advantageously\r\nposted the seven brigades into which he has organized his forces, at\r\nthese various positions along his extended front, as follows:\r\n\r\nAt the Stone Bridge, Brigadier-General N. G. Evans's Seventh Brigade, of\r\none regiment and one battalion of Infantry, two companies of Cavalry,\r\nand a battery of four six-pounders.\r\n\r\nAt Lewis's, Balls, and Island Fords--Colonel P. St. George Cocke's\r\nFifth Brigade, of three regiments of Infantry, one battery of Artillery,\r\nand one company of Cavalry.\r\n\r\nAt Mitchell's Ford, Brigadier-General M. L. Bonham's First Brigade, of\r\nfour Infantry regiments, two batteries, and six companies of Cavalry.\r\n\r\nAt Blackburn's Ford, Brigadier-General J. Longstreet's Fourth Brigade,\r\nof four Infantry regiments, with two 6-pounders.\r\n\r\nAt McLean's Ford, Brigadier-General D. R. Jones's Third Brigade of three\r\nInfantry regiments, one Cavalry company, and two 6-pounders.\r\n\r\nAt Union Mills Ford, Brigadier-General R. S. Ewell's Second Brigade, of\r\nthree Infantry regiments, three Cavalry companies, and four 12-powder\r\nhowitzers--Colonel Jubal A. Early's Sixth Brigade, of three Infantry\r\nregiments and three rifled pieces of Walton's Battery, being posted in\r\nthe rear of, and as a support to, Ewell's Brigade.\r\n\r\n     [Johnston also found, on the 20th, the Reserve Brigade of Brig.\r\n     Gen. T. H. Holmes--comprising two regiments of Infantry, Walker's\r\n     Battery of Artillery, and Scott's Cavalry-with Early's Brigade, \"in\r\n     reserve, in rear of the right.\"]\r\n\r\nThe disposition and strength of Beauregard's forces at these various\r\npoints along his line of defense on Bull Run stream, plainly shows his\r\nexpectation of an attack on his right; but he is evidently suspicious\r\nthat it may come upon his centre; for, as far back as July 8th, he had\r\nissued special orders to the effect that:\r\n\r\n\"Should the Enemy march to the attack of Mitchell's Ford, via\r\nCentreville, the following movements will be made with celerity:\r\n\r\n\"I. The Fourth Brigade will march from Blackburn's Ford to attack him on\r\nthe flank and centre.\r\n\r\n\"II. The Third Brigade will be thrown to the attack of his centre and\r\nrear toward Centreville.\r\n\r\n\"III.  The Second and Sixth Brigades united will also push forward and\r\nattack him in the rear by way of Centreville, protecting their own right\r\nflanks and rear from the direction of Fairfax Station and Court House.\r\n\r\n\"IV.  In the event of the defeat of the Enemy, the troops at Mitchell's\r\nFord and Stone Bridge, especially the Cavalry and Artillery, will join\r\nin the pursuit, which will be conducted with vigor but unceasing\r\nprudence, and continued until he shall have been driven beyond the\r\nPotomac.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it is not without interest to note Beauregard's subsequent\r\nindorsement on the back of these Special Orders, that: \"The plan of\r\nattack prescribed within would have been executed, with modifications\r\naffecting First and Fifth Brigades, to meet the attack upon Blackburn's\r\nFord, but for the expected coming of General Johnston's command, which\r\nwas known to be en route to join me on [Thursday] the 18th of July.\"\r\n\r\nThe knowledge thus possessed on Thursday, the 18th, by Beauregard, that\r\nJohnston's Army is on its way to join him, is of infinite advantage to\r\nthe former.  On the other hand, the complete ignorance, at this time, of\r\nMcDowell on this point,--and the further fact that he has been lulled\r\ninto a feeling of security on the subject, by General Scott's emphatic\r\nassurance to him that \"if Johnston joins Beauregard, he shall have\r\nPatterson on his heels\"--is a great disadvantage to the Union general.\r\n\r\nWere McDowell now aware of the real Military situation, he would\r\nunquestionably make an immediate attack, with the object of crushing\r\nBeauregard before Johnston can effect a junction with him.  It would\r\nthen be a mere matter of detail for the armies of McDowell, McClellan,\r\nand Patterson, to bag Johnston, and bring the armed Rebellion to an\r\ninglorious and speedy end.  But Providence--through the plottings of\r\nindividuals within our own lines--wills it otherwise.\r\n\r\nLong before this, Patterson has been informed by General Winfield Scott\r\nof the proposed movement by McDowell upon Manassas,--and of its date.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, July 13th, General Scott telegraphed to Patterson: \"I\r\ntelegraphed to you yesterday, if not strong enough to beat the Enemy\r\nearly next week, make demonstrations so as to detain him in the Valley\r\nof Winchester; but if he retreats in force toward Manassas, and it be\r\ntoo hazardous to follow him, then consider the route via Keys Ferry,\r\nLeesburg, etc.\"\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 17th, Scott telegraphs to Patterson: \"I have nothing\r\nofficial from you since Sunday (14th), but am glad to learn, through\r\nPhiladelphia papers, that you have advanced.  Do not let the Enemy amuse\r\nand delay you with a small force in front whilst he re-enforces the\r\nJunction with his main body.  McDowell's first day's work has driven the\r\nEnemy beyond Fairfax Court House.  The Junction will probably be carried\r\nby to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 18th, Patterson replies that to attack \"the greatly\r\nsuperior force at Winchester when the three months volunteers' time was\r\nabout up, and they were threatening to leave him--would be \"most\r\nhazardous\" and then he asks: \"Shall I attack?\"\r\n\r\nScott answers the same day: \"I have certainly been expecting you to beat\r\nthe Enemy.  If not, to hear that you had felt him strongly, or, at\r\nleast, had occupied him by threats and demonstrations.  You have been at\r\nleast his equal, and, I suppose, superior in numbers.  Has he not stolen\r\na march and sent re-enforcements toward Manassas Junction?  A week is\r\nenough to win victories,\" etc.\r\n\r\nPatterson retorts, on the same day: \"The Enemy has stolen no march upon\r\nme.  I have kept him actively employed, and by threats, and\r\nreconnaissances in force, caused him to be re-enforced.  I have\r\naccomplished in this respect more than the General-in-Chief asked, or\r\ncould well be expected, in face of an Enemy far superior in numbers,\r\nwith no line of communication to protect.\"\r\n\r\nIn another dispatch, to Assistant Adjutant-General Townsend (with\r\nGeneral Scott), he says, that same afternoon of Thursday, the 18th: \"I\r\nhave succeeded, in accordance with the wishes of the General-in-Chief,\r\nin keeping General Johnston's Force at Winchester.  A reconnaissance in\r\nforce, on Tuesday, caused him to be largely re-enforced from Strasburg.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, on Friday, the 19th, he informs Colonel Townsend that: \"The\r\nEnemy, from last information, are still at Winchester, and being\r\nre-enforced every night.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not until Saturday, the 20th of July, that he telegraphs to\r\nTownsend: \"With a portion of his force, Johnston left Winchester, by the\r\nroad to Millwood, on the afternoon of the 18th.\"  And he adds the\r\nridiculous statement: \"His whole force was about 35,200.\"\r\n\r\nThus, despite all the anxious care of General Scott, to have Johnston's\r\nArmy detained in the Shenandoah Valley, it has escaped Patterson so\r\nsuccessfully, and entirely, that the latter does not even suspect its\r\ndisappearance until the day before the pitched Battle of Bull Run is\r\nfought!  Its main body has actually reached Manassas twenty-four hours\r\nbefore Patterson is aware that it has left Winchester!\r\n\r\nAnd how is it, that Johnston gets away from Patterson so neatly?  And\r\nwhen does he do it?\r\n\r\n     [The extraordinary conduct of General Patterson at this critical\r\n     period, when everything seemed to depend upon his exertions, was\r\n     afterward the subject of inquiry by the Joint-Committee on the\r\n     Conduct of the War.  The testimony taken by that Committee makes it\r\n     clear, to any unprejudiced mind, that while Patterson himself may\r\n     have been loyal to the Union, he was weak enough to be swayed from\r\n     the path of duty by some of the faithless and unpatriotic officers\r\n     with whom he had partly surrounded himself--and especially by Fitz\r\n     John Porter, his Chief-of-staff.  Let us examine the sworn\r\n     testimony of two or three witnesses on this point.\r\n\r\n     General CHARLES W. SANFORD, who was second in command under\r\n     Patterson, and in command of Patterson's Left Wing, testified [see\r\n     pages 54-66, Report on Conduct of the War, Vol. 3, Part 2,] that he\r\n     was at a Council of War held at the White House, June 29th, when\r\n     the propriety of an attack on the Rebel lines at Manassas was\r\n     discussed; that he objected to any such movement until Patterson\r\n     was in such a position as to prevent the junction between General\r\n     Johnston's Army and the troops at Manassas; that on the 6th of\r\n     July, he was sent by General Scott, with four picked New York\r\n     regiments, to Patterson, and (waiving his own seniority rank)\r\n     reported to that General, at Williamsport; that Patterson gave him\r\n     command of a division of 8,000 men (and two batteries) out of a\r\n     total in his Army of 22,000; that he \"delivered orders from General\r\n     Scott to General Patterson, and urged a forward movement as soon as\r\n     possible;\" that there was \"Some delay at Martinsburg,\r\n     notwithstanding the urgency of our matter,\" but they \"left there on\r\n     [Monday] the 15th of July, and went in the direction of\r\n     Winchester,\"--down to Bunker Hill,--Patterson with two divisions\r\n     going down the turnpike, and Sanford taking his division a little\r\n     in advance and more easterly on the side roads so as to be in a\r\n     position to flank Johnston's right; that on that afternoon (Monday,\r\n     July 15) General Patterson rode up to where Sanford was locating\r\n     his camp.\r\n\r\n     Continuing his testimony, General Sanford said: \"I was then within\r\n     about nine miles of Johnston's fortified camp at Winchester.\r\n     Patterson was complimenting me upon the manner in which my\r\n     regiments were located, and inquiring about my pickets, which I had\r\n     informed him I had sent down about three miles to a stream below.\r\n     I had driven out the Enemy's skirmishers ahead of us.  They had\r\n     some cavalry there.  In answer to his compliments about the\r\n     comfortable location I had made, I said: 'Very comfortable,\r\n     General, when shall we move on?' * * *  He hesitated a moment or\r\n     two, and then said: 'I don't know yet when we shall move.  And if I\r\n     did I would not tell my own father.' I thought that was rather a\r\n     queer speech to make to me under the circumstances.  But I smiled\r\n     and said: 'General, I am only anxious that we shall get forward,\r\n     that the Enemy shall not escape us.'  He replied: 'There is no\r\n     danger of that.  I will have a reconnaissance to-morrow, and we\r\n     will arrange about moving at a very early period.'  He then took\r\n     his leave.\r\n\r\n     \"The next day [Tuesday, July 16th], there was a reconnaissance on\r\n     the Winchester turnpike, about four or five miles below the\r\n     General's camp.  He sent forward a section of artillery and some\r\n     cavalry, and they found a post-and-log fence across the Winchester\r\n     turnpike, and some of the Enemy's cavalry on the other side of it.\r\n     They gave them a round of grape.  The cavalry scattered off, and\r\n     the reconnaissance returned.  That was the only reconnaissance I\r\n     heard of while we were there.  My own pickets went further than\r\n     that.  But it was understood, the next afternoon, that we were to\r\n     march forward at daylight.  I sent down Col. Morell, with 40 men,\r\n     to open a road down to Opequan Creek, within five miles of the camp\r\n     at Winchester, on the side-roads I was upon, which would enable me,\r\n     in the course of three hours, to get between Johnston and the\r\n     Shenandoah River, and effectually bar his way to Manassas.  I had\r\n     my ammunition all distributed, and ordered my men to have 24 hours'\r\n     rations in their haversacks, independent of their breakfast.  We\r\n     were to march at 4 o'clock the next morning.  I had this road to\r\n     the Opequan completed that night.  I had then with me, in addition\r\n     to my eight regiments amounting to about 8,000 men and a few\r\n     cavalry, Doubleday's heavy United States battery of 20 and 30\r\n     pounders, and a very good Rhode Island battery.  And I was willing\r\n     to take the risk, whether Gen. Patterson followed me up or not, of\r\n     placing myself between Johnston and the Shenandoah River, rather\r\n     than let Johnston escape.  And, at 4 o'clock [July 17th] I should\r\n     have moved over that road for that purpose, if I had had no further\r\n     orders.  But, a little after 12 o'clock at night [July 16th-17th,]\r\n     I received a long order of three pages from Gen. Patterson,\r\n     instructing me to move on to Charlestown, which is nearly at right\r\n     angles to the road I was going to move on, and twenty-two miles\r\n     from Winchester.  This was after I had given my orders for the\r\n     other movement.\"\r\n\r\n               *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     'Question [by the Chairman].--And that left Johnston free?\r\n     \"Answer--Yes, Sir; left him free to make his escape, which he did.\r\n     * * *\"\r\n\r\n     'Question.--In what direction would Johnston have had to move to\r\n     get by you?\r\n     \"Answer--Right out to the Shenandoah River, which he forded.  He\r\n     found out from his cavalry, who were watching us, that we were\r\n     actually leaving, and he started at 1 o'clock that same day, with\r\n     8,000 men, forded the Shenandoah where it was so deep that he\r\n     ordered his men to put their cartridge-boxes on their bayonets, got\r\n     out on the Leesburg road, and went down to Manassas.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by the Chairman].--Did he [Patterson] assign any reason\r\n     for that movement?\r\n     \"Answer.--I was, of course, very indignant about it, and so were\r\n     all my officers and men; so much so that when, subsequently, at\r\n     Harper's Ferry, Patterson came by my camp, there was a universal\r\n     groan--against all discipline, of course, and we suppressed it as\r\n     soon as possible.  The excuse given by Gen. Patterson was this:\r\n     that he had received intelligence that he could rely upon, that\r\n     Gen. Johnston had been re-enforced by 20,000 men from Manassas,\r\n     and was going to make an attack upon him; and in the order which I\r\n     received that night--a long order of three pages--I was ordered to\r\n     occupy all the communicating roads, turning off a regiment here,\r\n     and two or three regiments there, and a battery at another place,\r\n     to occupy all the roads from Winchester to the neighborhood of\r\n     Charlestown, and all the cross-roads, and hold them all that day,\r\n     until Gen. Patterson's whole army went by me to Charlestown; and I\r\n     sat seven hours in the saddle near a place called Smithfield, while\r\n     Patterson, with his whole army, went by me on their way to\r\n     Charlestown, he being apprehensive, as he said, of an attack from\r\n     Johnston's forces.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by Mr. Odell].--You covered his movement?\r\n     \"Answer--Yes, Sir.  Now the statement that he made, which came to\r\n     me through Colonel Abercrombie, who was Patterson's brother-in-law,\r\n     and commanded one division in that army, was, that Johnston had\r\n     been re-enforced; and Gen. Fitz-John Porter reported the same thing\r\n     to my officers.  Gen. Porter was then the chief of Patterson's\r\n     staff, and was a very excellent officer, and an accomplished\r\n     soldier.  They all had got this story, which was without the\r\n     slightest shadow of foundation; for there had not a single man\r\n     arrived at the camp since we had got full information that their\r\n     force consisted of 20,000 men, of whom 1,800 were sick with the\r\n     measles.  The story was, however, that they had ascertained, by\r\n     reliable information, of this re-enforcement.  Where they got their\r\n     information, I do not know.  None such reached me; and I picked up\r\n     deserters and other persons to get all the information I could; and\r\n     we since have learned, as a matter of certainty, that Johnston's\r\n     forces never did exceed 20,000 men there.  But the excuse Patterson\r\n     gave was, that Johnson had been re-enforced by 20,000 men from\r\n     Manassas, and was going to attack him.  That was the reason he gave\r\n     then for this movement.  But in this paper he has lately published,\r\n     he hints at another reason--another excuse--which was that it was\r\n     by order of Gen. Scott.  Now, I know that the peremptory order of\r\n     Gen. Scott to Gen. Patterson, repeated over and over again, was\r\n     this--I was present on several occasions when telegraphic\r\n     communications went from Gen. Scott to Gen. Patterson: Gen. Scott's\r\n     orders to Gen. Patterson were that, if he were strong enough, he\r\n     was to attack and beat Johnston.  But if not, then he was to place\r\n     himself in such a position as to keep Johnston employed, and\r\n     prevent him from making a junction with Beauregard at Manassas.\r\n     That was the repeated direction of Gen. Scott to Gen. Patterson;\r\n     and it was because of Patterson's hesitancy, and his hanging back,\r\n     and keeping so far beyond the reach of Johnston's camp, that I was\r\n     ordered to go up there and re-enforce him, and assist him in any\r\n     operations necessary to effect that object.  The excuse of Gen.\r\n     Patterson now is, that he had orders from Gen. Scott to move to\r\n     Charlestown.  Now, that is not so.  But this state of things\r\n     existed: Before the movement was made from Martinsburg, General\r\n     Patterson suggested to General Scott that Charlestown would be a\r\n     better base of operations than Martinsburg and suggested that he\r\n     had better move on Charlestown, and thence make his approaches to\r\n     Winchester; that it would be better to do that than to move\r\n     directly to Winchester from Martinsburg; and General Scott wrote\r\n     back to say that, if he found that movement a better one, he was at\r\n     liberty to make it.  But Gen. Patterson had already commenced his\r\n     movement on Winchester direct from Martinsburg, and had got as far\r\n     as Bunker Hill; so that the movement which he had formerly\r\n     suggested, to Charlestown, was suppressed by his own act.  But that\r\n     is the pretence now given in his published speech for making the\r\n     movement from Bunker Hill to Charlestown, which was a retreat,\r\n     instead of the advance which the movement to Charlestown he first\r\n     proposed to Gen. Scott was intended to be.\"\r\n\r\n                   *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by the Chairman].--Was not that change of direction and\r\n     movement to Charlestown a total abandonment of the object which you\r\n     were pursuing?\r\n     \"Answer.--Entirely an abandonment of the main principles of the\r\n     orders he was acting under.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--And of course an abandonment of the purpose for which\r\n     you were there?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by Mr. Odell].-Was it not your understanding in leaving\r\n     here, and was it not the understanding also of Gen. Scott, that\r\n     your purpose in going there was to check Johnston with direct\r\n     reference to the movement here?\r\n     \"Answer--Undoubtedly.  It was in consequence of the suggestion made\r\n     by me at the Council at the President's house.  * * *  And upon the\r\n     suggestion of General Scott they wanted me to go up there and\r\n     assist Patterson in this movement against Johnston, so as to carry\r\n     out the point I had suggested of first checkmating Johnston before\r\n     the movement against Manassas was made here.\"\r\n\r\n                    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     Question [by the Chairman].--Would there have been any difficulty\r\n     in preventing Johnston from going to Manassas?\r\n     \"Answer.--None whatever.\"\r\n\r\n                    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by the Chairman.]--I have heard it suggested that he\r\n     (Patterson) undertook to excuse this movement on the ground that\r\n     the time of many of his troops had expired, and they refused to\r\n     accompany him.\r\n     \"Answer.--That to my knowledge, is untrue.  The time of none of\r\n     them had expired when this movement was made.  All the troops that\r\n     were there were in the highest condition for the service.  These\r\n     three-months' men, it may be well to state to you who are not\r\n     Military men, were superior to any other volunteer troops that we\r\n     had, in point of discipline.  They were the disciplined troops of\r\n     the Country.  The three-months' men were generally the organized\r\n     troops of the different States--New York, Pennsylvania, etc.  We\r\n     had, for instance, from Patterson's own city, Philadelphia, one of\r\n     the finest regiments in the service, which was turned over to me,\r\n     at their own request; and the most of my regiments were disciplined\r\n     and organized troops.  They were all in fine condition, anxious,\r\n     zealous, and earnest for a fight.  They thought they were going to\r\n     attack Johnston's camp at Winchester.  Although I had suggested to\r\n     Gen. Patterson that there was no necessity for that, the camp being\r\n     admirably fortified with many of their heavy guns from Norfolk, I\r\n     proposed to him to place ourselves between Johnston and the\r\n     Shenandoah, which would have compelled him to fight us there, or to\r\n     remain in his camp, either of which would have effected General\r\n     Scott's object.  If I had got into a fight, it was very easy, over\r\n     this road I had just been opening, for Patterson to have\r\n     re-enforced me and to have come up to the fight in time.  The\r\n     proposition was to place ourselves between Johnston's fortified\r\n     camp and the Shenandoah, where his fortified camp would have been\r\n     of no use to him.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--Even if you had received a check there, it would have\r\n     prevented his junction with the forces at Manassas?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir; I would have risked a battle with my own\r\n     division rather than Johnston should have escaped.  If he had\r\n     attacked me, I could have taken a position where I could have held\r\n     it, while Patterson could have fallen upon him and repulsed him.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by Mr. Odell].--Had you any such understanding with\r\n     Patterson?\r\n     \"Answer.--I told him I would move down on this side-road in\r\n     advance, leaving Gen. Patterson to sustain me if I got into a\r\n     fight.  So, on the other hand, if he should attack Patterson, I was\r\n     near enough to fall upon Johnston's flank and to support Patterson.\r\n     By using this communication of mine to pass Opequan Creek--where, I\r\n     had informed Patterson, I had already pushed forward my pickets,\r\n     [200 men in the day and 400 more at night,] to prevent the Enemy\r\n     from burning the bridge--it would have enabled me to get between\r\n     Johnston and the Shenandoah River.  On the morning [Wednesday, July\r\n     17th] of our march to Charlestown, Stuart's cavalry, which figured\r\n     so vigorously at Bull Run, was upon my flank all day.  They were\r\n     apparently about 800 strong.  I saw them constantly on my flank for\r\n     a number of miles.  I could distinguish them, with my glass, with\r\n     great ease.  Finally, they came within about a mile of the line of\r\n     march I was pursuing and I sent a battery around to head them off,\r\n     and the 12th Regiment across the fields in double-quick time to\r\n     take them in the rear.  I thought I had got them hemmed in.  But\r\n     they broke down the fences, and went across the country to\r\n     Winchester, and I saw nothing more of them.  They were then about\r\n     eight miles from Winchester, and must have got there in the course\r\n     of a couple of hours.  That day [Wednesday, the 17th] at 10\r\n     o'clock--as was ascertained from those who saw him crossing the\r\n     Shenandoah--Johnston started from Winchester with 8,000 men, forded\r\n     the Shenandoah, and got to Manassas on Friday night; and his second\r\n     in command started the next day with all the rest of the available\r\n     troops--something like 9,000 men; leaving only the sick, and a few\r\n     to guard them, in the camp at Winchester--and they arrived at the\r\n     battle-field in the midst of the fight, got out of the cars, rushed\r\n     on the battle-field, and turned the scale.  I have no doubt that,\r\n     if we had intercepted Johnston, as we ought to have done, the\r\n     battle of Bull Run would have been a victory for us instead of a\r\n     defeat.  Johnston was undoubtedly the ablest general they had in\r\n     their army.\"\r\n\r\n     Colonel CRAIG BIDDLE, testified that he was General Patterson's\r\n     aide-de-camp at the time.  In answer to a question by the Chairman,\r\n     he continued:\r\n\r\n     \"Answer.--I was present, of course, at all the discussions.  The\r\n     discussion at Martinsburg was as to whether or not General\r\n     Patterson should go on to Winchester.  General Patterson was very\r\n     full of that himself.  He was determined to go to Winchester; but\r\n     the opinions of all the regular officers who were with him, were\r\n     against it.  The opinions of all the men in whose judgment I had\r\n     any confidence, were against it.  They seemed to have the notion\r\n     that General Patterson had got his Irish blood up by the fight we\r\n     had had at Falling Waters, and was bound to go ahead.  He decided\r\n     upon going ahead, against the remonstrances of General [Fitz John]\r\n     Porter, who advised against it.  He told me he considered he had\r\n     done his duty, and said no more.  The movement was delayed in\r\n     consequence of General Stone's command not being able to move right\r\n     away.  It was then evident that there was so much opposition to it\r\n     that the General was induced to call a council of the general\r\n     officers in his command, at which I was present.  They were\r\n     unanimously opposed to the advance.  That was at Martinsburg.\"\r\n\r\n                   *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--While at Bunker Hill, the night before you left there,\r\n     were any orders issued to march in the evening?\r\n     \"Answer.--I think there were such orders.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--Did not General Patterson issue orders at Bunker Hill,\r\n     the night before you marched to Charlestown, for an attack on the\r\n     Enemy?\r\n     \"Answer.-I think such orders were written.  I do not think they\r\n     were issued.  I think General Patterson was again persuaded not to\r\n     make an advance.\"\r\n\r\n     Colonel R. BUTLER PRICE, Senior aide to Patterson, testified as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n                    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     \"Question [by Mr. Gooch].--Was it not the intention to move from\r\n     Bunker Hill to Winchester?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir.  At one time General Patterson had given an\r\n     order to move from Bunker Hill to Winchester.  He was very\r\n     unwilling to leave Johnston even at Winchester without attacking\r\n     him; and on the afternoon before we left Bunker Hill he decided to\r\n     attack him, notwithstanding his strong force.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--Behind his intrenchments?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir; it went so far that his order was written by\r\n     his adjutant, General [Fitz John] Porter.  It was very much against\r\n     the wishes of General [Fitz John] Porter; and he asked General\r\n     Patterson if he would send for Colonel Abercrombie and Colonel\r\n     Thomas and consult them on the movement.  General Patterson\r\n     replied: No, Sir; for I know they will attempt to dissuade me from\r\n     it, and I have made up my mind to fight Johnston under all\r\n     circumstances.  That was the day before we left Bunker Hill.  Then\r\n     Colonel [Fitz John] Porter asked to have Colonel Abercrombie and\r\n     Colonel Thomas sent for and consulted as to the best manner to\r\n     carry out his wishes.  He consented, and they came, and after half\r\n     an hour they dissuaded him from it.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--At that time General Patterson felt it was so important\r\n     to attack Johnston that he had determined to do it?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir; the order was not published, but it was\r\n     written.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--You understood General Patterson to be influenced to\r\n     make that attempt because he felt there was a necessity for\r\n     detaining Johnston?\r\n     \"Answer.--Yes, Sir; to detain him as long as he possibly could.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Question.--That order was not countermanded until late on Tuesday,\r\n     the 16th, was it?\r\n     \"Answer.--That order never was published.  It was written; but, at\r\n     the earnest solicitation of Colonel [Fitz John] Porter, it was\r\n     withheld until he could have a consultation with Colonel\r\n     Abercrombie and Colonel Thomas.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is about 1 o'clock on the morning of Thursday, July 18th,--that same\r\nday which witnesses the preliminary Battle of Blackburn's Ford--that\r\nJohnston, being at Winchester, and knowing of Patterson's peculiarly\r\ninoffensive and timid movement to his own left and rear, on Charlestown,\r\nreceives from the Rebel Government at Richmond, a telegraphic dispatch,\r\nof July 17th, in these words: \"General Beauregard is attacked.  To\r\nstrike the Enemy a decisive blow, a junction of all your effective force\r\nwill be needed.  If practicable, make the movement.  * * *  In all the\r\narrangements exercise your discretion.\"\r\n\r\nJohnston loses no time in deciding that it is his duty to prevent, if\r\npossible, disaster to Beauregard's Army; that to do this he must effect\r\na junction with him; and that this necessitates either an immediate\r\nfight with, and defeat of, Patterson,--which may occasion a fatal\r\ndelay--or else, that Union general must be eluded.  Johnston determines\r\non the latter course.\r\n\r\nLeaving his sick, with some militia to make a pretense of defending the\r\ntown in case of attack, Johnston secretly and rapidly marches his Army,\r\nof 9,000 effective men, Southeasterly from Winchester, at noon of\r\nThursday, the 18th; across by a short cut, wading the Shenandoah River,\r\nand then on through Asby's Gap, in the Blue Ridge, that same night;\r\nstill on, in the same direction, to a station on the Manassas Gap\r\nrailroad, known as Piedmont, which is reached by the next (Friday)\r\nmorning,--the erratic movements of Stuart's Cavalry entirely concealing\r\nthe manoeuvre from the knowledge of Patterson.\r\n\r\nFrom Piedmont, the Artillery and Cavalry proceed to march the remaining\r\ntwenty-five miles, or so, to Manassas Junction, by the roads.  The 7th\r\nand 8th Georgia Regiments of Bartow's Brigade, with Jackson's Brigade,\r\n--comprising the 2d, 4th, 5th, 27th and 33d Virginia Regiments--are\r\nembarked on the cars, and hurriedly sent in advance, by rail, to\r\nManassas, reaching there on that same (Friday) afternoon and evening.\r\nThese are followed by General Johnston, with Bee's Brigade--comprising\r\nthe 4th Alabama, 2d Mississippi, and a battalion of the 11th\r\nMississippi--which arrive at Manassas about noon of Saturday, the 20th\r\nof July, the balance of Johnston's Infantry being billed for arrival\r\nthat same day, or night.\r\n\r\nUpon Johnston's own arrival at Manassas, Saturday noon,--the very day\r\nthat Patterson ascertains that \"the bird has flown,\"--after assuming\r\ncommand, by virtue of seniority, he proceeds to examine Beauregard's\r\nposition.  This he finds \"too extensive, and the ground too densely\r\nwooded and intricate,\" to be learned quickly, and hence he is impelled\r\nto rely largely upon Beauregard for information touching the strength\r\nand positions of both the Rebel and Union Armies.\r\n\r\nBeauregard has now 21,833 men, and 29 pieces of artillery of his own\r\n\"Army of the Potomac.\"  Johnston's and Holmes's junction with him has\r\nraised the Rebel total to 32,000 effectives, and 55 guns.  McDowell, on\r\nthe other hand, who started with 30,000 effectives, finds himself on the\r\n19th--owing to the departure of one of his regiments and a battery of\r\nArtillery, because of the expiration of their term of enlistment,--with\r\nbut \"28,000 men at the utmost.\"--[Comte de Paris.]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Saturday, the 20th of July, Johnston and Beauregard\r\nhold an important consultation.  The former feels certain that\r\nPatterson, with his more than 20,000 effectives, will now lose no time\r\nin essaying a junction with McDowell's Army, and that such junction will\r\nprobably be effected by July 22nd.  Hence he perceives the necessity of\r\nattacking McDowell, and if possible, with the combined Rebel Forces,\r\nwhipping him before Patterson can come up to his assistance.\r\n\r\nAt this consultation it is agreed by the two Rebel generals to assume\r\nthe offensive, at once.  Beauregard proposes a plan of battle--which is\r\nan immediate general advance of the Rebel centre and left,\r\nconcentrating, from all the fords of Bull Run, upon Centreville, while\r\nthe Rebel right advances toward Sangster's cross-roads, ready to fall\r\neither on Centreville, or upon Fairfax Court House, in its rear,\r\naccording to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed, is accepted at once by Johnston.  The necessary order\r\nis drawn up by Beauregard that night; and at half past four o'clock on\r\nSunday morning, July 21st, Johnston signs the written order.  Nothing\r\nnow remains, apparently, but the delivery of the order to the Rebel\r\nbrigade commanders, a hurried preparation for the forward movement, and\r\nthen the grand attack upon McDowell, at Centreville.\r\n\r\nAlready, no doubt, the fevered brain of Beauregard pictures, in his\r\nvivid imagination, the invincible thunders of his Artillery, the\r\nimpetuous advance of his Infantry, the glorious onset of his Cavalry,\r\nthe flight and rout of the Union forces, his triumphal entry into\r\nWashington--Lincoln and Scott and the Congress crouching at his feet\r\n--and the victorious South and conquered North acclaiming him Dictator!\r\nThe plan is Beauregard's own, and Beauregard is to have command.  Hence\r\nall the glory of capturing the National Capital, must be Beauregard's.\r\nWhy not?  But \"man proposes, and God disposes.\"  The advance and attack,\r\nare, in that shape, never to be made.\r\n\r\nMcDowell, in the meantime, all unconscious of what has transpired in the\r\nShenandoah Valley, and between there and Manassas; never dreaming for an\r\ninstant that Patterson has failed to keep Johnson there--even if he has\r\nnot attacked and defeated him; utterly unsuspicious that his own\r\nlessened Union Army has now to deal with the Forces of Johnston and\r\nBeauregard combined--with a superior instead of an inferior force; is\r\nexecuting a plan of battle which he has decided upon, and announced to\r\nhis general officers, on that same Saturday evening, at his Headquarters\r\nin Centreville.\r\n\r\nInstead of attempting to turn the Enemy's right, and cut off his\r\ncommunications with Richmond and the South, McDowell has now determined\r\nto attack the Enemy's left, cut his communication, via the Manassas Gap\r\nrailroad, with Johnston's Army,--still supposed by him to be in the\r\nValley of the Shenandoah--and, taking him in the left flank and rear,\r\nroll him upon Manassas, in disorder and defeat--with whatever might\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nThat is the plan--in its general features.  In executing it, Blenker's\r\nBrigade of Miles's Division is to remain at Centreville as a reserve,\r\nthrowing up intrenchments about its Heights, upon which to fall back, in\r\ncase of necessity; Davies's Brigade of the same Division, with\r\nRichardson's Brigade of Tyler's Division--as the Left Wing--are to\r\ndemonstrate at Blackburn's Ford, toward the Enemy's right; Tyler's other\r\nthree brigades, under Keyes, Schenck, and Sherman, are to feign an\r\nattack on the Enemy's left, posted behind the strongly-defended Stone\r\nBridge over which the Warrenton turnpike, running Westward, on its way\r\nfrom Centreville to Warrenton, crosses Bull Run stream; while the strong\r\ndivisions under Hunter and Heintzelman--forming McDowell's Right Wing\r\n--are to follow Tyler's Division Westward down the turnpike to a point\r\nwithin one mile and a half of the Stone Bridge, thence, by cross-road,\r\ndiverge several miles to the North, then sweep around gradually to the\r\nWest, and then Southwardly over Bull Run at Sudley Springs Ford,\r\nswooping down the Sudley road upon the Enemy's left flank and rear, near\r\nStone Bridge, rolling it back toward his center, while Tyler's remaining\r\nthree brigades cross the bridge and join in the assault.  That is the\r\nwhole plan in a nutshell.\r\n\r\nIt has been McDowell's intention to push forward, from Centreville along\r\nthe Warrenton Pike a few miles, on the evening of this Military\r\nconference; but he makes his first mistake, in allowing himself to be\r\ndissuaded from that, by those, who, in his own words, \"have the greatest\r\ndistance to go,\" and who prefer \"starting early in the morning and\r\nmaking but one move.\"\r\n\r\nThe attacking divisions now have orders to march at 2:30 A. M., in order\r\n\"to avoid the heat,\" which is excessive.  Tyler's three immediate\r\nbrigades--or some of them--are slow in starting Westward, along the\r\nWarrenton Pike, to the Stone Bridge; and this leads to a two or three\r\nhours delay of the divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman, before they can\r\nfollow that Pike beyond Centreville, and commence the secret detour to\r\ntheir right, along the cross-road leading to Sudley Springs.\r\n\r\nAt 6:30 A.M., Tyler's Artillery gets into position, to cannonade the\r\nEnemy's batteries, on the West Bank of Bull Run, commanding the Stone\r\nBridge, and opens fire.  Half an hour before this, (at 6 A.M.), the\r\nRebel artillerists, posted on a hill South of the Pike, and 600 yards\r\nWest of the bridge, have caught sight of Tyler's Union blue-jackets.\r\nThose of the Rebel gunners whose eyes are directed to the North-East,\r\nsoon see, nearly a mile away, up the gradual slope, a puff of blue\r\nsmoke.  Immediately the bang of a solitary rifle cannon is heard, and\r\nthe scream of a rifled shot as it passes over their heads.  At\r\nintervals, until past 9 A.M., that piece and others in the same\r\nposition, keep hammering away at the Rebel left, under Evans, at Stone\r\nBridge.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel response to this cannonade, is very feeble.  McDowell observes\r\nthis.  He suspects there has been a weakening of the Enemy's force at\r\nthe bridge, in order to strengthen his right for some purpose.  And what\r\ncan that purpose be, but to throw his augmented right upon our left, at\r\nBlackburn's Ford, and so, along the ridge-road, upon Centreville?  Thus\r\nMcDowell guesses, and guesses well.  To be in readiness to protect his\r\nown left and rear, by reenforcing Miles's Division, at Centreville and\r\nalong the ridge to Blackburn's Ford, he temporarily holds back Howard's\r\nBrigade of Heintzelman's Division at the point where the cross-road to\r\nSudley Springs Ford-along which Hunter's Division, followed by the\r\nBrigades of Franklin and Wilcox, of Heintzelman's Division, have already\r\ngone-intersects the Warrenton Pike.\r\n\r\nIt is 9 o'clock.  Beauregard, as yet unaware of McDowell's new plan,\r\nsends an order to Ewell, on his right, to hold himself ready \"to take\r\nthe offensive, at a moment's notice,\"--and directing that Ewell be\r\nsupported in his advance, toward Sangster's cross-roads and the rear of\r\nCentreville, by Holmes's Brigade.  In accordance with that order, Ewell,\r\nwho is \"at Union Mills and its neighborhood,\" gets his brigade ready,\r\nand Holmes moves up to his support.  After waiting two hours, Ewell\r\nreceives another order, for both Ewell and Holmes \"to resume their\r\nplaces.\"  Something must have occurred since 9 o'clock, to defeat\r\nBeauregard's plan of attack on Centreville--with all its glorious\r\nconsequences!  What can it be?  We shall see.\r\n\r\nWhile Tyler's Artillery has been cannonading the Rebel left, under\r\nEvans, at Stone Bridge,--fully impressed with the prevailing Union\r\nbelief that the bridge is not only protected by strong masked batteries,\r\nheavy supports of Infantry, and by abatis as well as other defenses, but\r\nis also mined and ready to be blown up at the approach of our troops,\r\nwhen in reality the bridge is not mined, and the Rebel force in men and\r\nguns at that point has been greatly weakened in anticipation of\r\nBeauregard's projected advance upon Centreville,--the Union column,\r\nunder Hunter and Heintzelman, is advancing from Centreville, in the\r\nscorching heat and suffocating dust of this tropical July morning,\r\nslowly, but surely, along the Warrenton Pike and the cross-road to\r\nSudley Springs Ford--a distance of some eight miles of weary and\r\ntoilsome marching for raw troops in such a temperature--in this order:\r\nBurnside's Brigade, followed by Andrew Porter's Brigade,--both of\r\nHunter's Division; then Franklin's Brigade, followed by Willcox's\r\nBrigade,--both of Heintzelman's Division.\r\n\r\nIt is half past 9 o'clock; before Burnside's Brigade has crossed the\r\nBull Run stream, at Sudley's Ford, and the head of Andrew Porter's\r\nBrigade commences to ford it.  The troops are somewhat slow in crossing.\r\nThey are warm, tired, thirsty, and as to dust,--their hair and eyes and\r\nnostrils and mouths are full of it, while most of the uniforms, once\r\nblue, have become a dirty gray.  The sky is clear.  The sun already is\r\nfiercely hot.  The men stop to drink and fill their canteens.  It is\r\nwell they do.\r\n\r\nMcDowell, who has been waiting two or three hours at the turn, impatient\r\nat the delay, has ridden over to the front of the Flanking column, and\r\nnow reaches Sudley's Ford.  He feels that much valuable time is already\r\nlost.  His plan has, in a measure, been frustrated by delay.  He had\r\ncalculated on crossing Bull Run, at Sudley's Ford, and getting to the\r\nrear of the Enemy's position, at Stone Bridge, before a sufficient Rebel\r\nforce could be assembled to contest the Union advance.  He sends back an\r\naide with orders to the regimental commanders in the rear, to \"break\r\nfrom column, and hurry forward separately, as fast as possible.\"\r\nAnother aide he sends, with orders to Howard to bring his brigade\r\nacross-fields.  To Tyler he also sends orders to \"press forward his\r\nattack, as large bodies of the Enemy are passing in front of him to\r\nattack the division (Hunter's) which has passed over.\"\r\n\r\nIt may here be explained, that the Sudley road, running about six miles\r\nSouth-Southeasterly from Sudley Springs Ford to Manassas Junction, is\r\ncrossed at right angles, about two miles South of the Springs, by the\r\nWarrenton Pike, at a point about one mile and a half West of the Stone\r\nBridge.  For nearly a mile South of Sudley Ford, the Sudley road passes\r\nthrough thick woods on the left, and alternate patches of wooded and\r\ncleared lands on the right.  The country farther South, opens into\r\nrolling fields, occasionally cut by transverse gullies, and patched with\r\nwoods.  This is what Burnside's Brigade beholds, as it marches\r\nSouthward, along the Sudley road, this eventful morning.\r\n\r\nThus far, the cannonade of Tyler's batteries, and the weak return-fire\r\nof the Rebel Artillery, at Stone Bridge, over two miles South-East of\r\nSudley Ford, is about the only music by which the Union march has kept\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBut now, as Burnside's foremost regiment emerges from the woods, at half\r\npast 10 o'clock, the Artillery of the Enemy opens upon it.\r\n\r\nLet us see how this happens.  Evans's Brigade, defending the Stone\r\nBridge, and constituting the Enemy's extreme left, comprises, as has\r\nalready been mentioned, Sloan's 4th South Carolina Regiment, Wheat's\r\nLouisiana battalion, Terry's squadron of Virginia Cavalry, and\r\nDavidson's section of Latham's Battery of six-pounders.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the morning Evans has supposed, from the cannonade of Tyler's\r\nbatteries among the pines on the hills obliquely opposite the Enemy's\r\nleft, as well as from the sound of the cannonade of the Union batteries\r\naway down the stream on the Enemy's right, near Blackburn's Ford, that\r\nMcDowell is about to make an attack upon the whole front of the Rebel\r\nline of defense along Bull Run-by way of the Stone Bridge, and the\r\nvarious fords below it, which cross that stream.  But by 10 o'clock,\r\nthat Rebel general begins to feel doubtful, suspicious, and uneasy.\r\nDespite the booming of Tyler's guns, he has caught in the distance the\r\nrumbling sounds of Hunter's Artillery wheels.\r\n\r\nEvans finds himself pondering the meaning of those long lines of dust,\r\naway to his left; and then, like a flash, it bursts upon him, that all\r\nthis Military hubbub in his front, and far away to his right, is but a\r\nfeint; that the real danger is somehow connected with that mysterious\r\nfar-away rumble, and those lines of yellow dust; that the main attack is\r\nto be on the unprepared left and rear of the Rebel position!\r\n\r\nNo sooner has the Rebel brigade-commander thus divined the Union plan of\r\nattack, than he prepares, with the limited force at his command, to\r\nthwart it.  Burnside and he are about equidistant, by this time, from\r\nthe intersection of the Sudley road, running South, with the Warrenton\r\nPike, running West.  Much depends upon which of them shall be the first\r\nto reach it,--and the instinctive, intuitive knowledge of this, spurs\r\nEvans to his utmost energy.  He leaves four of his fifteen companies,\r\nand Rogers's section of the Loudoun Artillery,--which has come up from\r\nCocke's Brigade, at the ford below--to defend the approaches to the\r\nStone Bridge, from the East side of Bull Run,--and, with the other\r\neleven companies, and Latham's half-battery, he hurries Westward, along\r\nthe Warrenton Pike, toward the Sudley road-crossing, to resist the\r\nimpending Union attack.\r\n\r\nIt is now 10:30 o'clock, and, as he hurries along, with anxious eyes,\r\nscanning the woods at the North, he suddenly catches the glitter of\r\nBurnside's bayonets coming down through them, East of the Sudley road,\r\nin \"column of regiments\" toward Young's Branch--a small stream turning,\r\nin a Northern and Southern loop, respectively above and below the\r\nWarrenton Pike, much as the S of a prostrate dollar-mark twines above\r\nand below its horizontal line, the vicinity of which is destined to be\r\nhotly-contested ground ere night-fall.\r\n\r\n     [Says Captain D.  P.  Woodbury, U.  S.  corps of engineers, and\r\n     who, with Captain Wright, guided the divisions of Hunter and\r\n     Heintzelman in making the detour to the upper part of Bull Run: \"At\r\n     Sudley's Mills we lingered about an hour to give the men and horses\r\n     water and a little rest before going into action, our advance guard\r\n     in the mean time going ahead about three quarters of a mile.\r\n     Resuming our march, we emerged from the woods about one mile South\r\n     of the ford, and came upon a beautiful open valley about one and a\r\n     quarter miles square, bounded on the right or West by a wooded\r\n     ridge, on the Fast by the rough spurs or bluffs of Bull Run, on the\r\n     North by an open plain and ridge, on which our troops began to\r\n     form, and on the South by another ridge, on which the Enemy was\r\n     strongly posted, with woods behind their backs.  The Enemy was also\r\n     in possession of the bluffs of Bull Run on our left.\"]\r\n\r\nSending word to Headquarters, Evans pushes forward and gaining Buck\r\nRidge, to the North of the Northern loop of Young's Branch, forms his\r\nline-of-battle upon that elevation--which somewhat compensates him for\r\nthe inferiority of his numbers--nearly at right angles to the Bull Run\r\nline; rapidly puts his Artillery in position; the Rebel guns open on\r\nBurnside's advance--their hoarse roar soon supplemented by the rattle of\r\nRebel musketry, and the answering roar and rattle of the Union onset;\r\nand the Battle of Bull Run has commenced!\r\n\r\nIt is after 10:30 A.M., and Beauregard and Johnston are upon an eminence\r\nin the rear of the centre of the Enemy's Bull Run line.  They have been\r\nthere since 8 o'clock.  An hour ago, or more, their Signal Officer has\r\nreported a large body of Union troops crossing the Bull Run Valley, some\r\ntwo or three miles above the Stone Bridge; upon the strength of which,\r\nJohnston has ordered Bee's Brigade from near Cocke's position, with\r\nHampton's Legion and Stonewall Jackson's Brigade from near Bonham's\r\nleft, to move to the Rebel left, at Stone Bridge; and these troops are\r\nnow hastening thither, guided by the sound of the guns.\r\n\r\nThe artillery-firing is also heard by Johnston and Beauregard, but\r\nintervening wooded slopes prevent them from determining precisely whence\r\nit comes.  Beauregard, with a badly-organized staff, is chaffing over\r\nthe delay that has occurred in carrying out his own plan of battle.  He\r\nis waiting to hear of the progress of the attack which he has ordered\r\nupon the Union Army,--supposed by him to be at Centreville,--and\r\nespecially as to the advance of his right toward Sangster's Station.  In\r\nthe meantime also,--from early morning,--the Rebel commanders have heard\r\nheavy firing in the direction of Blackburn's Ford, toward their right,\r\nwhere the Artillery attached to the brigades of Davies and Richardson,\r\nconstituting McDowell's Left Wing, is demonstrating in a lively manner,\r\nin accordance with McDowell's plan.\r\n\r\nIt is 11 o'clock.  Beauregard has become satisfied that his orders for\r\nthe Rebel advance and attack on Centreville, have failed or miscarried.\r\nHis plan is abandoned, and the orders countermanded.  At the same time\r\nthe growing volume of artillery-detonations upon the left of the Bull\r\nRun line of defense--together with the clouds of dust which indicate the\r\nroute of march of Hunter's and Heintzelman's Divisions from near\r\nCentreville to the point of conflict, satisfies both Johnston and\r\nBeauregard, that a serious attack is imperilling the Rebel left.\r\n\r\nBeauregard at once proposes to Johnston \"a modification of the abandoned\r\nplan,\" viz.: \"to attack with the\" Rebel \"right, while the left stands on\r\nthe defensive.\"  But rapidly transpiring events conspire to make even\r\nthe modified plan impracticable.\r\n\r\nJohnston, convinced by the still growing volume of battle-sounds on the\r\nRebel left, that the main attack of McDowell is being made there, urges\r\nBeauregard to strengthen the left, as much as possible; and, after that\r\ngeneral has sent orders to this end,--to Holmes and Early to come up\r\nwith their Brigades from Union Mills Ford, moving \"with all speed to the\r\nsound of the firing,\" and to Bonham to promptly send up, from Mitchell's\r\nFord, a battery and two of his regiments--both he and Beauregard put\r\nspurs to their horses, and gallop at full speed toward the firing, four\r\nmiles away on their left,--stopping on the way only long enough for\r\nJohnston to order his Chief-of-artillery, Colonel Pendleton, to \"follow,\r\nwith his own, and Alburtis's Batteries.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile let us return and witness the progress of the battle, on the\r\nRebel left,--where we were looking on, at 10:30 o'clock.  Evans had then\r\njust posted his eleven companies of Infantry on Buck Ridge, with one of\r\nhis two guns on his left, near the Sudley road, and the other not far\r\nfrom the Robinson House, upon the Northern spur of the elevated plateau\r\njust South of Young's Branch, and nearly midway between the Sudley road\r\nand Stone Bridge.\r\n\r\nThe battle, as we have seen, has opened.  As Burnside's Brigade appears\r\non the slope, to the North of Buck Ridge (or Hill), it is received by a\r\nrapid, well-sustained, and uncomfortable, but not very destructive fire,\r\nfrom Evans's Artillery, and, as the Union regiments press forward, in\r\ncolumn, full of impulsive ardor, the Enemy welcomes the head of the\r\ncolumn with a hot musketry-fire also, delivered from the crest of the\r\nelevation behind which the Rebel Infantry lie flat upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThis defense by Evan's demi-Brigade still continues, although half an\r\nhour, or more, has elapsed.  Burnside has not yet been able to dislodge\r\nthe Enemy from the position.  Emboldened to temerity by this fact, Major\r\nWheat's Louisiana battalion advances through the woods in front, upon\r\nBurnside, but is hurled back by a galling fire, which throws it into\r\ndisorder and flight.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, however, the brigades of Bee and Bartow--comprising the\r\n7th and 8th Georgia, 2nd Mississippi, 4th Alabama, 6th North Carolina,\r\nand two companies of the 11th Mississippi, with Imboden's Battery of\r\nfour pieces--recently arrived with Johnston from Winchester, come up,\r\nform on the right of Sloan's 4th South Carolina Regiment, while Wheat\r\nrallies his remnant on Sloan's left, now resting on the Sudley road, and\r\nthe whole new Rebel line opens a hot fire upon Burnside's Brigade.\r\n\r\nHunter, for the purpose of better directing the Union attack, is at this\r\nmoment rapidly riding to the left of the Union line,--which is advancing\r\nSouthwardly, at right angles to Bull Run stream and the old line of\r\nRebel defense thereon.  He is struck by the fragment of a shell, and\r\ncarried to the rear.\r\n\r\nColonel John S. Slocum's, 2nd Rhode Island, Regiment, with Reynold's\r\nRhode Island Battery (six 13-pounders), having been sent to the front of\r\nBurnside's left, and being closely pressed by the Enemy, Burnside's own\r\nregiment the 1st Rhode Island, is gallantly led by Major Balch to the\r\nsupport of the 2nd, and together they handsomely repulse the Rebel\r\nonset.  Burnside now sends forward Martin's 71st New York, with its two\r\nhowitzers, and Marston's 2nd New Hampshire,--his whole Brigade, of four\r\nregiments and a light artillery battery, being engaged with the heavy\r\nmasked battery (Imboden's and two other pieces), and nearly seven full\r\nregiments of the Enemy.\r\n\r\nThe regiments of Burnside's Brigade are getting considerably cut up.\r\nColonels Slocum and Marston, and Major Balch, are wounded.  There is\r\nsome confusion in the ranks, and the Rhode Island Battery is in danger\r\nof capture, when General Andrew Porter--whose own brigade has just\r\nreached the field and is deploying to the right of Burnside's--succeeds\r\nHunter in command of the division, and rides over to his left.  Burnside\r\nasks him for Sykes's battalion of regulars, which is accordingly\r\ndetached from the extreme right of Andrew Porter's Division, rapidly\r\nforms on the left, in support of the Rhode Island Battery, and opens a\r\nhot and effective fire which, in connection with the renewed fire of\r\nBurnside's rallied regiments, and the opening artillery practice of\r\nGriffin's Battery--that has just come up at a gallop and gone into a\r\ngood position upon an eminence to the right of Porter's Division, and to\r\nthe right of the Sudley road looking South--fairly staggers the Enemy.\r\n\r\nAnd now the brigades of Sherman and Keyes, having been ordered across\r\nBull Run by General Tyler, are seen advancing from Poplar Ford, at the\r\nrear of our left,--Sherman's Brigade, headed by Corcoran's 69th New York\r\nRegiment, coming up on Burnside's left, while Keves's Brigade is\r\nfollowing, to the left again of, Sherman.\r\n\r\n     [Sherman, in his Official Report, after mentioning the receipt by\r\n     him of Tyler's order to \"cross over with the whole brigade to the\r\n     assistance of Colonel Hunter\"--which he did, so far as the Infantry\r\n     was concerned, but left his battery under Ayres behind, on account\r\n     of the impassability of the bluff on the Western bank of Bull Run\r\n     --says: \"Early in the day, when reconnoitering the ground, I had seen\r\n     a horseman descend from a bluff in our front, cross the stream, and\r\n     show himself in the open field, and, inferring we could cross over\r\n     at the same point, I sent forward a company as skirmishers, and\r\n     followed with the whole brigade, the New York Sixty-ninth leading.\"\r\n\r\n     This is evidently the ford at the elbow of Bull Run, to the right\r\n     of Sherman's front, which is laid down on the Army-maps as \"Poplar\r\n     Ford,\" and which McDowell's engineers had previously discovered and\r\n     mapped; and to which Major Barnard of the U. S.  Engineer Corps\r\n     alludes when, in his Official Report, he says: \"Midway between the\r\n     Stone Bridge and Sudley Spring our maps indicated another ford,\r\n     which was said to be good.\"\r\n\r\n     The Comte de Paris, at page 241, vol. I. of his admirable \"History\r\n     of the Civil War in America,\" and perhaps other Military\r\n     historians, having assumed and stated--upon the strength of this\r\n     passage in Sherman's Report--that \"the Military instinct\" of that\r\n     successful soldier had \"discovered\" this ford; and the impression\r\n     being thus conveyed, however undesignedly, to their readers, that\r\n     McDowell's Engineer corps, after spending two or three days in\r\n     reconnaissances, had failed to find the ford which Sherman had in a\r\n     few minutes \"discovered\" by \"Military instinct;\" it is surely due\r\n     to the truth of Military history, that the Engineers be fairly\r\n     credited with the discovery and mapping of that ford, the existence\r\n     of which should also have been known to McDowell's brigade\r\n     commanders.\r\n\r\n     If, on the other hand, the Report of the Rebel Captain Arthur L.\r\n     Rogers, of the Loudoun Artillery, to General Philip St. George\r\n     Cocke, be correct, it would seem that Sherman attempted to cross\r\n     Bull Run lower down than Poplar Ford, which is \"about one mile\r\n     above the Stone Bridge,\" but was driven back by the fire of\r\n     Rogers's guns to cross at that particular ford; for Rogers, in that\r\n     Report, says that about 11 o'clock A. M., the first section of the\r\n     Loudoun Artillery, under his command, \"proceeded to the crest of\r\n     the hill on the West Side of Bull Run, commanding Stone Bridge.  *\r\n     * * Here.\"  continues he, \"I posted my section of Artillery, and\r\n     opened a brisk fire upon a column of the Enemy's Infantry, supposed\r\n     to be two regiments, advancing towards me, and supported by his\r\n     battery of rifled cannon on the hills opposite.  These poured into\r\n     my section a steady fire of shot and shell.  After giving them some\r\n     fifty rounds, I succeeded in heading his column, and turned it up\r\n     Bull Run to a ford about one mile above Stone Bridge, where, with\r\n     the regiments which followed, they crossed, and proceeded to join\r\n     the rest of the Enemy's forces in front of the main body of our\r\n     Army.\"]\r\n\r\nBefore this developing, expanding, and advancing attack of the Union\r\nforces, the Rebel General Bee, who--since his coming up to support\r\nEvans, with his own and Bartow's Brigades, to which had since been added\r\nHampton's Legion,--has been in command of this new Rebel line of defense\r\nupon the left of the Bull Run line, concludes that that attack is\r\ngetting too strong for him, and orders his forces to retreat to the\r\nSouthward, and re-form on a second line, parallel to their present line,\r\nand behind the rising ground at their rear.  They do so, somewhat faster\r\nthan he desires.  The whole line of the Rebel centre gives way, followed\r\nby the wings, as far as the victorious Union troops can see.\r\n\r\nWe must be blind if we cannot perceive that thus far, the outlook, from\r\nthe Union point of view,--despite numberless mistakes of detail, and\r\nsome, perhaps, more general in their character--is very good.  The \"Boys\r\nin Blue\" are irresistibly advancing, driving the \"Rebel Gray\" back and\r\nback, without let or hindrance, over the Buck Hill ridge, over Young's\r\nBranch, back to, and even over, the Warrenton Pike.  Time, to be sure,\r\nis flying--valuable time; but the Enemy also is retiring.--There is some\r\nslight confusion in parts of our own ranks; but there is much more in\r\nhis.  At present, we have decidedly the best of it.  McDowell's plan has\r\nbeen, thus far, successful.  Will that success continue?  We shall see.\r\n\r\nHeintzelman's Division is coming, up from the rear, to the Union right\r\n--Franklin's Brigade, made up of the 5th and 11th Massachusetts, and 1st\r\nMinnesota, with Ricketts's splendid battery of six 10-pounder Parrotts,\r\nforming on the right of Andrew Porter's Brigade and Division; while\r\nWillcox's demi-Brigade, with its 11th (\"Fire Zouaves\") and 38th New\r\nYork--having left Arnold's Battery of four pieces, with the 1st Michigan\r\nas its support, posted on a hill commanding Sudley's Ford--comes in, on\r\nthe right of Franklin, thus forming the extreme right of the advancing\r\nUnion line of attack.\r\n\r\nAs our re-enforcing brigades come up, on our right, and on our left, the\r\nEnemy falls back, more and more discouraged and dismayed.  It seems to\r\nhim, as it does to us, \"as though nothing can stop us.\"  Jackson,\r\nhowever, is now hurrying up to the relief of the flying and disordered\r\nremnants of Bee's, Bartow's, and Evans's Brigades; and these\r\nsubsequently rally, with Hampton's Legion, upon Jackson's strong brigade\r\nof fresh troops, so that, on a third new line, to which they have been\r\ndriven back, they soon have--6,500 Infantry, 13 pieces of Artillery, and\r\nStuart's cavalry-posted in a belt of pines which fringes the Southern\r\nskirt of the Henry House plateau--in a line-of-battle which, with its\r\nleft resting upon the Sudley road, three-quarters of a mile South of its\r\nintersection with the Warrenton Pike, is the irregular hypothenuse of a\r\nright-angled triangle, formed by itself and those two intersecting\r\nroads, to the South-East of such intersection.  It is within this\r\nright-angled triangular space that the battle, now proceeding, bids\r\nfair to rage most fiercely.\r\n\r\nJohnston and Beauregard, riding up from their rear, reach this new\r\n(third) line to which the Rebel troops have been driven, about noon.\r\nThey find the brigades of Bee, Bartow, and Evans, falling back in great\r\ndisorder, and taking shelter in a wooded ravine, South of the Robinson\r\nHouse and of the Warrenton Pike.  Hampton's Legion, which has just been\r\ndriven backward over the Pike, with great loss, still holds the Robinson\r\nHouse.  Jackson, however, has reached the front of this line of defense,\r\nwith his brigade of the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 27th, and 33rd Virginia Infantry,\r\nand Pendleton's Battery--all of which have been well rested, since their\r\narrival, with other brigades of Johnston's Army of the Shenandoah, from\r\nWinchester, a day or two back.\r\n\r\nAs Jackson comes up, on the left of \"the ravine and woods occupied by\r\nthe mingled remnants of Bee's, Bartow's and Evans's commands,\" he posts\r\nImboden's, Stanard's, and Pendleton's Batteries in line, \"below the brim\r\nof the Henry House plateau,\" perhaps one-eighth of a mile to the\r\nEast-Southeastward of the Henry House, at his centre; Preston's 4th\r\nVirginia, and Echol's 27th Virginia, at the rear of the battery-line;\r\nHarper's 5th Virginia, with Radford's Cavalry, at its right; and, on its\r\nleft, Allen's 2nd Virginia; with Cumming's 33rd Virginia to the left of\r\nthat again, and Stuart's Cavalry covering the Rebel left flank.\r\n\r\nIt is about this time that the chief Rebel generals find their position\r\nso desperate, as to necessitate extraordinary measures, and personal\r\nexposure, on their part.  Now it is, that Jackson earns the famous\r\nsobriquet which sticks to him until he dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Bee approaches Jackson--so goes the story, according to Swinton;\r\n     he points to the disordered remnants of his own brigade mingled\r\n     with those of the brigades of Bartow and Evans huddled together in\r\n     the woods, and exclaims: \"General, they are beating us back!\"\r\n     \"Sir,\" responds Jackson, drawing himself up, severely, \"We'll give\r\n     them the bayonet!\" And Bee, rushing back among his confused troops,\r\n     rallies them with the cry: \"There is Jackson, standing like a Stone\r\n     wall!  Let us determine to die here, and we will conquer.\"]\r\n\r\nNow it is, that Johnston and Beauregard, accompanied by their staffs,\r\nride backward and forward among the Rebel ranks, rallying and\r\nencouraging them.  Now it is, that, Bee and Bartow and Hampton being\r\nwounded, and the Lieutenant-Colonel of the Hampton Legion killed,\r\nBeauregard leads a gallant charge of that legion in person.  And now it\r\nis, that Johnston himself, finding all the field-officers of the 4th\r\nAlabama disabled, \"impressively and gallantly charges to the front\" with\r\nthe colors of that regiment at his side!\r\n\r\nThese conspicuous examples of bravery, inspire the Rebel troops with\r\nfresh courage, at this admittedly \"critical\" moment.\r\n\r\nJohnston now assigns to Beauregard the chief \"command of the left\" of\r\nthe Bull Run line,--that is to say, the chief command of the Enemy's new\r\nline of defense, which, as we have seen, is on the left of, and at right\r\nangles to, the old Bull Run line--while he himself, riding back to the\r\nLewis House, resumes \"the command of the whole field.\"\r\n\r\nOn his way to his rear, Johnston orders Cocke to send reenforcements to\r\nBeauregard.  He also dispatches orders to hurry up to that Rebel\r\ngeneral's support, the brigades of Holmes and Early from near the Union\r\nMills Ford, and that of Bonham  from Mitchell's Ford,--Ewell with his\r\nbrigade,  being also directed to \"follow with all speed\" from Union\r\nMills Ford-making a total of over 10,000 fresh troops.\r\n\r\nFrom the \"commanding elevation\" of the Lewis House, Johnston can observe\r\nthe position of the Union forces beyond Bull Run, at Blackburn's Ford\r\nand Stone Bridge; the coming of his own re-enforcing brigades from far\r\ndown the valley, toward Manassas; and the manoeuvres of our advancing\r\ncolumns under McDowell.\r\n\r\nAs the battle proceeds, the Enemy's strength on the third new line of\r\ndefense increases, until he has 22 guns, 260 Cavalry, and 12 regiments\r\nof Infantry, now engaged.  It is interesting to observe also, that, of\r\nthese, 16 of the guns, 9 of the regiments, and all of the Cavalry\r\n(Stuart's), belong to Johnston's Army of the Shenandoah, while only 6\r\nguns and 3 Infantry regiments thus engaged, belong to Beauregard's Army\r\nof the Potomac.  Thus the burden of the battle has been, and is being,\r\nborne by Johnston's, and not Beauregard's troops--in the proportion of\r\nabout three of the former, to one of the latter,--which, for over two\r\nhours, maintain their position despite many successive assaults we make\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nIt is after 2 o'clock P.M., when Howard's Brigade, of Heintzelman's\r\nDivision, reaches the battle-field, almost broken down with exhaustion.\r\nBy order of Heintzelman it has moved at double-quick for a mile of the\r\nway, until, under the broiling heat, it can do so no longer.  The last\r\ntwo miles of the weary tramp, while the head of the brigade has moved at\r\nquick time, the rear, having lost distances, moves, much of the time, at\r\na double-quick.  As a consequence, many of Howard's men drop out, and\r\nabsolutely faint from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAs Howard's Brigade approaches the field, besides the ambulances and\r\nlitters, conveying to the rear the wounded and dying, crowds of\r\nretreating stragglers meet and tell it to hurry along; that the Enemy\r\nhas been driven back a mile; but, as it marches along, its regiments do\r\nnot feel particularly encouraged by the disorganization so prevalent;\r\nand the fact that as they come into action, the thunders of the Rebel\r\nArtillery do not seem to meet an adequately voluminous response--from\r\nthe Union side, seems to them, a portent of evil.  Weary and fagged out,\r\nthey are permitted to rest, for a while, under cover.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, our line, increased, as it has been, by the brigades of\r\nSherman and Keyes, on the left of Burnside, and of Franklin and Wilcox,\r\non the right of Porter, has continued to advance victoriously.  Our\r\ntroops are, to be sure, considerably scattered, having been \"moved from\r\npoint to point\" a good deal.  On our left, the Enemy has been driven\r\nback nearly a mile, and Keyes's Brigade is pushing down Bull Run, under\r\nshelter of the bluffs, trying to turn the right of the Enemy's new line,\r\nand give Schenck's Brigade a better chance for crossing the Stone\r\nBridge, still commanded by some of the Rebel guns.\r\n\r\nHaving \"nothing to do\" there, \"several of the Union regiments\" are\r\ncoming over, from our left toward our right, with a view of overlapping,\r\nand turning, the Enemy's left.\r\n\r\nIt is about half past 2 o'clock.  The batteries of Griffin and Ricketts\r\nhave already been advanced as far as the eminence, upon our right, upon\r\nwhich stands the Dogan House.  Supported by Lyons's gallant 14th New\r\nYork Chasseurs, Griffin's and Ricketts's Batteries are still pouring a\r\nterribly destructive fire into the batteries and columns of the Enemy,\r\nnow behind the brow of the Henry House hill, wherever exposed, while\r\nPalmer's seven companies of Union Cavalry are feeling the Enemy's left\r\nflank, which McDowell proposes to turn.  The flags of eight Union\r\nregiments, though \"borne somewhat wearily\" now point toward the hilly\r\nHenry House plateau, beyond which \"disordered masses of Rebels\" have\r\nbeen seen \"hastily retiring.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a lull in the battle.  The terrible heat is exhausting to the\r\ncombatants on both sides.  Griffin and Ricketts have wrought such havoc\r\nwith their guns, that \"nothing remains to be fired at.\"  Victory seems\r\nmost surely to be ours.\r\n\r\nAway down at his headquarters at the Lewis House, the Rebel General\r\nJohnston stands watching the progress of the battle, as it goes against\r\nhim.  Nervously he glances, every now and then, over his left shoulder,\r\nas if expecting something.  An officer is galloping toward him, from\r\nManassas.  He comes from the office of Beauregard's Adjutant-General, at\r\nthat point.  He rides up and salutes.  \"General,\" says he, breathlessly,\r\n\"a United States Army has reached the line of the Manassas Gap railroad,\r\nand is now but three or four miles from our left flank!\"\r\n\r\nJohnston clenches his teeth nervously.  Thick beads of perspiration\r\nstart from his forehead.  He believes it is Patterson's Army that has\r\nfollowed \"upon his heels\" from before Winchester, faster than has been\r\nanticipated; and, as he thinks of Kirby Smith, who should long since\r\nhave arrived with Elzey's Brigade--all, of his own \"Army of the\r\nShenandoah,\" that has not yet followed him to Manassas,--the exclamation\r\ninvoluntarily bursts from his lips: \"Oh, for four regiments!\"\r\n\r\n     [Says a correspondent and eye-witness of the battle, writing to the\r\n     Richmond Dispatch, from the battle-field, July 23d: \"Between two\r\n     and three o'clock large numbers of men were leaving the field, some\r\n     of them wounded, others exhausted by the long struggle, who gave us\r\n     gloomy reports; but, as the firing on both sides continued\r\n     steadily, we felt sure that our brave Southerners had not been\r\n     conquered by the overwhelming hordes of the North.  It is, however,\r\n     due to truth to say that the result at this hour hung trembling in\r\n     the balance.  We had lost numbers of our most distinguished\r\n     officers.  Gens. Barlow and Bee had been stricken down; Lieut; Col.\r\n     Johnson of the Hampton Legion had been killed; Col. Hampton had\r\n     been wounded.  But there was at hand a fearless general whose\r\n     reputation was staked on this battle: Gen. Beauregard promptly\r\n     offered to lead the Hampton Legion into action, which he executed\r\n     in a style unsurpassed and unsurpassable.  Gen. Beauregard rode up\r\n     and down our lines, between the Enemy and his own men, regardless\r\n     of the heavy fire, cheering and encouraging our troops.  About this\r\n     time, a shell struck his horse, taking its head off, and killing\r\n     the horses of his aides, Messrs. Ferguson and Hayward.  * * *  Gen.\r\n     Johnston also threw himself into the thickest of the fight, seizing\r\n     the colors of a Georgia (Alabama) regiment, and rallying then to\r\n     the charge.  * * *  Your correspondent heard Gen. Johnston exclaim\r\n     to Gen. Cocke, just at the critical moment, 'Oh, for four\r\n     regiments!'  His wish was answered; for in the distance our\r\n     re-enforcements appeared.  The tide of battle was turned in our favor\r\n     by the arrival of Gen. Kirby Smith, from Winchester, with 4,000 men\r\n     of Gen. Johnston's Division.  Gen. Smith heard, while on the\r\n     Manassas Railroad cars, the roar of battle.  He stopped the train,\r\n     and hurried his troops across the fields to the point just where he\r\n     was most needed.  They were at first supposed to be the Enemy,\r\n     their arrival at that point of the field being entirely unexpected.\r\n     The Enemy fell back, and a panic seized them.  Cheer after cheer\r\n     from our men went up, and we knew the battle had been won.\"\r\n\r\n     Another Rebel correspondent who, as an officer of the Kentucky\r\n     battalion of General Johnston's Division of the Rebel Army,\r\n     participated in the battle, wrote to the Louisville Courier from\r\n     Manassas, July 22, an account of it, in which, after mentioning\r\n     that the Rebel Army had been forced back for two miles, he\r\n     continues; \"The fortunes of the day were evidently against us.\r\n     Some of our best officers had been slain, and the flower of our\r\n     Army lay strewn upon the field, ghastly in death or gaping with\r\n     wounds.  At noon, the cannonading is described as terrific.  It was\r\n     an incessant roar for more than two hours, the havoc and\r\n     devastation at this time being fear ful.  McDowell * * * had nearly\r\n     outflanked us, and they were just in the act of possessing\r\n     themselves of the Railway to Richmond.  Then all would have been\r\n     lost.  But most opportunely--I may say Providentially--at this\r\n     juncture, Gen. Johnston, [Kirby Smith it should be] with the\r\n     remnant of Johnston's Division--our Army, as we fondly call it, for\r\n     we have been friends and brothers in camp and field for three\r\n     months--reappeared, and made one other desperate struggle to obtain\r\n     the vantage-ground.  Elzey's Brigade of Marylanders and Virginians\r\n     led the charge; and right manfully did they execute the work,\"]\r\n\r\n\"The prayer of the wicked availeth not,\" 'tis said; yet never was the\r\nprayer of the righteous more quickly answered than is that of the Rebel\r\nGeneral-in-chief!  Johnston himself, alluding to this exigent moment,\r\nafterward remarks, in his report: \"The expected reenforcements appeared\r\nsoon after.\"  Instead of Patterson's Union Army, it is Kirby Smith,\r\ncoming up, with Elzey's Brigade, from Winchester!\r\n\r\nSatisfied of the safe arrival of Kirby Smith, and ordering him up, with\r\nElzey's Brigade, Johnston directs Kershaw's 2nd and Cash's 8th South\r\nCarolina Regiments, which have just come up, with Kemper's Battery, from\r\nBonham's Brigade, to strengthen the Rebel left, against the attempt\r\nwhich we are still making to reach around it, about the Sudley road, to\r\ntake it in reverse.  Fisher's 6th North Carolina Regiment arriving about\r\nthe same time, is also hurried along to help Beauregard.\r\n\r\nBut during the victorious lull, heretofore alluded to, something is\r\nhappening on our side, that is of very serious moment.  Let us see what\r\nit is:\r\n\r\nThe batteries of Griffin and Ricketts, at the Dogan House, having\r\nnothing to fire at, as we have seen, are resting, pleased with the\r\nconsciousness of their brilliant and victorious service against the\r\nRebel batteries and Infantry columns, when they are ordered by McDowell\r\n--who, with his staff, is upon elevated ground to the rear of our\r\nright,--to advance 1,000 yards further to the front, \"upon a hill near\r\nthe Henry House.\"\r\n\r\nRicketts considers this a perilous job--but proceeds to execute the\r\norder as to his own battery.  A small ravine is in his front.  With\r\nRicketts gallantly leading, the battery dashes across the ravine at full\r\ngallop, breaking one wheel as it goes, which is at once replaced.  A\r\nfence lies across the way.  The cannoniers demolish it.  The battery\r\nascends the hill near the Henry House, which is full of the Enemy's\r\nsharpshooters.\r\n\r\n     [For this, and what immediately follows, see the testimony of\r\n     Ricketts and others, before the Committee on the Conduct of the\r\n     War.]\r\n\r\nSoon as Ricketts gets his guns in battery, his men and horses begin to\r\nfall, under the fire of these sharpshooters.  He turns his guns upon the\r\nHenry House,--and \"literally riddles it.\"  Amid the moans of the\r\nwounded, the death scream of a woman is heard!  The Enemy had permitted\r\nher to remain in her doomed house!\r\n\r\nBut the execution is not all on one side, by any means.  Ricketts is in\r\na very hot place--the hottest, he afterward declares, that he has ever\r\nseen in his life--and he has seen fighting before this.\r\n\r\nThe Enemy is behind the woods, at the front and right of Ricketts's\r\nBattery.  This, with the added advantage of the natural slope of the\r\nground, enables him to deliver upon the brave Union artillerists a\r\nconcentrated fire, which is terribly destructive, and disables so many\r\nof Rickett's horses that he cannot move, if he would.  Rickett's own\r\nguns, however, are so admirably served, that a smooth-bore battery of\r\nthe Enemy, which has been stubbornly opposing him, is driven back,\r\ndespite its heavy supports.\r\n\r\nAnd Griffin's Battery now comes rapidly up into position on the left of,\r\nand in line with, Ricketts.  For Griffin also has been ordered from the\r\nDogan House hill, to this new, and dangerously exposed, position.\r\n\r\nBut when Major Barry, General McDowell's Chief of Artillery, brings him\r\nthe order, Griffin hesitates--for he has no Infantry support.\r\n\r\n\"The Fire Zouaves--[The 11th New York]--will support you,\" says Barry,\r\n\"They are just ready to follow you at the double-quick!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why not let them go and get in position on the hill,\" says\r\nGriffin; \"then, let Ricketts's and my batteries come into battery\r\nbehind; and then, let them (the Zouaves) fall back?\"\r\n\r\nGriffin advises, also, as a better position for his own battery, a hill\r\n500 yards in the rear of the Henry House hill.  But advice is thrown\r\naway.  His artillery-chief is inflexible.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you,\" says Griffin again, \"the Fire Zouaves won't support us.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will,\" replies Barry.  \"At any rate it is General McDowell's order\r\nto go there!\"\r\n\r\nThat settles the business.  \"I will go,\" responds Griffin; \"but mark my\r\nwords, they will not support us!\"\r\n\r\nGriffin's Battery, indeed, starts first, but, owing to the mistake of\r\none of his officers, it has to be countermarched, so that Ricketts's is\r\nthrown to the front, and, as we have seen, first reaches the crest of\r\nthe Henry House hill.\r\n\r\nGriffin, as he comes up with his guns, goes into battery on the left of\r\nRicketts, and at once opens briskly on the Enemy.  One of Griffin's guns\r\nhas a ball lodged in the bore, which cannot be got in or out.  His other\r\nfive guns, with the six guns of Ricketts, make eleven pieces, which are\r\nnow side by side-all of them driving away at the Enemy's (Stonewall\r\nJackson's) strong batteries, not more than 300 yards away.\r\n\r\nThey have been at it half an hour perhaps, when Griffin moves two of his\r\npieces to the right of Ricketts, and commences firing with them.  He has\r\nhardly been there five minutes, when a Rebel regiment coming out of the\r\nwoods at Griffin's right front, gets over a rail fence, its Colonel\r\nsteps out between his regiment (now standing up to the knees in rank\r\ngrass) and the battery, and commences a speech to his men!\r\n\r\nGriffin orders one of his officers to load with canister, and let\r\ndrive at them.  The guns are loaded, and ready to fire, when up gallops\r\nBarry, exclaiming: \"Captain, don't fire there; those are your\r\nbattery-supports!\"\r\n\r\nAt this supreme moment, Reynolds's gorgeous looking Marines are sitting\r\ndown in close column, on the ground, to the left of the Union batteries.\r\nThe showy 11th New York \"Fire Zouaves\" are a little to the rear of the\r\nright of the guns.  The gallant 14th New York Chasseurs, in their\r\ndust-covered red uniforms, who had followed Griffin's Battery, at some\r\ndistance, have, only a little while since, pushed finely up, from the\r\nravine at the rear of our batteries, into the woods, to the right of\r\nGriffin and Ricketts, at a double-quick.  To the left of the batteries,\r\nclose to the battalion of Marines, Heintzelman bestrides his horse, near\r\nsome of his own Division.\r\n\r\nTo Major Barry's startling declaration, Captain Griffin excitedly\r\nshouts: \"They are Confederates!  Sure as the world, they are\r\nConfederates!\"\r\n\r\nBut Barry thinks he knows better, and hastily responds: \"I know they are\r\nyour battery-support.\"\r\n\r\nGriffin spurs toward his pieces, countermands his previous order,\r\nand firing is resumed in the old direction.\r\n\r\nAndrew Porter, has just ridden up to Heintzelman's side, and now catches\r\nsight of the Rebel regiment.  \"What troops are those?\" he asks of\r\nGeneral Hientzelman, pointing in their direction.\r\n\r\nWhile Heintzelman is replying, and just as Averell drops his reins and\r\nlevels his field-glass at them, \"down come their pieces-rifles and\r\nmuskets,--and probably,\" as Averell afterward said, \"there never was\r\nsuch a destructive fire for a few minutes.  It seemed as though every\r\nman and horse of that battery just laid right down, and died right off!\"\r\n\r\nIt is a dreadful mistake that has been made.  And there seems to have\r\nbeen no excuse for it either.  The deliberateness of the Rebel colonel\r\nhas given Barry abundant time to have discovered his error.  For Griffin\r\nsubsequently declared, under oath, that, \"After the officer who had been\r\ntalking to the regiment had got through, he faced them to the left,\r\nmarched them about fifty yards to the woods, then faced them to the\r\nright again, marched them about forty yards toward us, then opened fire\r\nupon us--and that was the last of us!\"\r\n\r\nIt is a terrible blunder.  For, up to this moment, the battle is\r\nundeniably ours.  And, while the Rebel colonel has been haranguing his\r\nbrave men, there has been plenty of time to have \"passed the word\" along\r\nthe line of our batteries, and poured canister into the Rebel regiment\r\nfrom the whole line of eleven guns, at point-blank range, which must\r\ninevitably have cut it all to pieces.  The fate of the day hung balanced\r\nright there and then--with all the chances in favor of McDowell.  But\r\nthose chances are now reversed.  Such are the fickle changes in the\r\nfortunes of battle!\r\n\r\nInstead of our batteries cutting to pieces the Rebel Infantry regiment,\r\nthe Rebel Infantry regiment has mowed down the gallant artillerists of\r\nour batteries.  Hardly a man of them escapes.  Death and destruction\r\nreap a wondrous and instant harvest.  Wounded, dying, or dead, lie the\r\nbrave cannoniers at their guns, officers and men alike hors du combat,\r\nwhile wounded horses gallop wildly back, with bounding caissons, down\r\nthe gentle declivity, carrying disorder, and further danger, in their\r\nmad flight.\r\n\r\nThe supporting Fire Zouaves and Marines, on the right and left of our\r\nline of guns, stand, with staring eyes and dumb open-mouths, at the\r\nsudden turn of affairs.  They are absolutely paralyzed with\r\nastonishment.  They do not run at first.  They stand, quaking and\r\npanic-stricken.  They are urged to advance upon the Rebel regiment\r\n--\"to give them a volley, and then try the bayonet.\"  In vain!  They\r\nfire perhaps 100 scattering shots; and receive in return, as they break\r\nand run down the hill to the rear, volley after volley, of deadly lead,\r\nfrom the Rebel muskets.\r\n\r\nBut, as this Rebel regiment (Cummings's 33rd Virginia) advances to seize\r\nthe crippled and defenceless guns, it is checked, and driven back, by\r\nthe 1st Michigan Regiment of Willcox's Brigade, which has pushed forward\r\nin the woods at our extreme right.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, having been ordered by McDowell to support Ricketts's\r\nBattery, Howard has formed his four tired regiments into two lines\r\n--Berry's 4th Maine, and Whitney's 2nd Vermont, on the right and left of\r\nthe first; and Dunnell's 5th, and his own 3rd Maine, under Staples, in\r\nthe second line.  Howard himself leads his first line up the elevated\r\nplateau of the Henry House.  Reaching the crest, the line delivers its\r\nfire, volley after volley, despite the concentrated hail of the Enemy's\r\nArtillery and muskets.  As the second line advances, a Rebel\r\ncannon-ball, and an unfortunate charge of our own Cavalry, scatters most\r\nof the 5th Maine.  The 2nd Vermont, which has advanced 200 yards beyond\r\nthe crest, rapidly firing, while the Enemy retires, is now, in turn,\r\nforced back by the Enemy's hot fire, and is replaced by the 3rd Maine,\r\nwhile the remnant of the 5th moves up to the extreme right of Howard's\r\nnow single line.  But the Rebel fire grows hotter and hotter, and owing\r\nto this, and a misunderstood order, Howard's line begins to dissolve,\r\nand then retires in confusion,--Howard and others vainly striving to\r\nrally his own utterly exhausted men.\r\n\r\nSherman's Brigade, too, has come over from our left, and now advances\r\nupon the deadly plateau, where lie the disabled Union batteries--the\r\nprizes, in full sight of both Armies, for which each seems now to be so\r\ndesperately striving.\r\n\r\nQuinby's 13th New York Rifles, in column of companies, leads the\r\nbrigade, followed by Lieutenant-Colonel Peck's 2d Wisconsin, Cameron's\r\n79th New York (Highlanders), and Corcoran's 69th New York (Irish), \"in\r\nline of battle.\"  Down the slope, across the ravine, and up, on the\r\nother side, steadily presses Quinby, till he reaches the crest.  He\r\nopens fire.  An advancing Rebel regiment retires, as he pushes up to\r\nwhere the Union batteries and cannoniers lie wounded and dying--the\r\nother three regiments following in line-of-battle until near the crest,\r\nwhen the fire of the Enemy's rifles and musketry, added to his heavy\r\ncannonading, grows so severe that the brigade is forced back to shelter\r\nin a roadway leading up the plateau.\r\n\r\nPeck's 2nd Wisconsin, now emerges from this sheltered roadway, and\r\nsteadily mounts the elevation, in the face of the Enemy's severe fire\r\n--returning it, with spirit, as it advances.  But the Rebel fire becomes\r\ntoo galling.  The gray-clad Wisconsin boys return to the sheltered road\r\nagain, while the cry goes up from Sherman's ranks: \"Our own men are\r\nfiring at them!\"  Rallying at the road, the 2nd Wisconsin again returns,\r\nwith desperate courage, to the crest of the hill, delivers its fire, and\r\nthen, unable to withstand the dreadful carnage, falls back once more, in\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nAt this, the 79th (Highland) Regiment springs forward, to mount the brow\r\nof the fatal hill, swept as it is, with this storm of shot and shell and\r\nmusket-balls.  Up, through the lowering smoke, lit with the Enemy's\r\nincessant discharges in the woods beyond, the brave Highlanders jauntily\r\nmarch, and, with Cameron and their colors at their head, charge\r\nimpetuously across the bloody hill-crest, and still farther, to the\r\nfront.  But it is not in human nature to continue that advance in the\r\nteeth of the withering fire from Jackson's batteries, strengthened, as\r\nthey are, by Pelham's and Kemper's.  The gallant fellows fall back,\r\nrally again, advance once more, retire again, and at last,--the heroic\r\nCameron being mortally wounded,--fall back, in confusion, under the\r\ncover of the hill.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while Quinby's Regiment, on another ridge, more to the left, is\r\nalso again engaging the Enemy, the 69th New York, led by the fearless\r\nCorcoran, dashes forward, up the Henry House hill, over the forbidding\r\nbrow, and beyond.  As the brave Irishmen reach the abandoned batteries,\r\nthe hoarse roar of cannon, the sharp rattle of musketry-volleys, the\r\nscream of shot and shell, and the whistling of bullets, is at once\r\ndeafening and appalling, while the air seems filled with the iron and\r\nleaden sleet which sweeps across the scorched and blasted plateau of the\r\nHenry House.  Nobly the Irish Regiment holds its ground for a time; but,\r\nat last, it too falls back, before the hurtling tempest.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the day are plainly turning against us.  Time is also\r\nagainst us--as it has been all along--while it is with the Enemy.  It is\r\npast 3 o'clock.\r\n\r\nSince we last looked at Beauregard's third new defensive line, there\r\nhave been material accessions to it.  The remains of the brigades of\r\nBee, Evans, and Bartow, have been reformed on the right of Jackson's\r\nBrigade--Bee on his immediate right, Evans to the right of Bee, and\r\nBartow to the right of Evans, with a battery which has been engaging\r\nSchenck's Brigade on the other side of Bull Run near the Stone Bridge;\r\nwhile Cocke's Brigade watches Bull Run to the rear of Bartow.  On the\r\nleft of Jackson's.  Brigade, is now to be seen a part of Bonham's\r\nBrigade (Kershaw's 2nd South Carolina, and Cash's 8th South Carolina)\r\nwith Kemper's Battery on its left.  Kirby Smith has reached the front,\r\nfrom Manassas, and--in advancing from his position on the left of\r\nBonham's demi-Brigade, just West of the Sudley road, with Elzey's\r\nBrigade, in a counter-attack upon our right-is wounded, and carried to\r\nthe rear, leaving his command to Elzey.  Stuart's Cavalry are in the\r\nwoods, still farther to the Enemy's left, supporting Beckham's Battery.\r\nEarly's Brigade is also coming up, from Union Mills Ford, not far to the\r\nrear of the Enemy's left, with the design of coming into line between\r\nElzey's Brigade and Beckham's Battery, and out-flanking and attacking\r\nour right.  But let us bring our eyes back to the bloody contest, still\r\ngoing on, for the possession of the batteries of Griffin and Ricketts.\r\n\r\nArnold's Battery has raced up on our right, and is delivering shot,\r\nshell, spherical case, and canister, with effect, although exposed to a\r\nsevere and accurate fire from the Enemy.  Wilcox, with what is left of\r\nthe 1st Michigan, after once retaking the batteries on the plateau, from\r\nthe 7th Georgia, has got around the Enemy's left flank and is actually\r\nengaged with the Enemy's rear, while that Enemy's front is engaged with\r\nFranklin and Sherman!  But Hobart Ward's 38th New York, which Wilcox has\r\nordered up to support the 1st Michigan, on our extreme right, in this\r\nflanking movement, has been misdirected, and is now attacking the\r\nEnemy's centre, instead of his left; and Preston's 28th Virginia--which,\r\nwith Withers's 18th Virginia, has come up to the Rebel left, from\r\nCocke's Brigade, on the Enemy's right--finding the 1st Michigan broken,\r\nin the woods, attacks it, and wounds and captures Wilcox.  Withers's\r\nRegiment has, with a yell--the old \"Rebel yell,\" now rising everywhere\r\nfrom Rebel throats, and so often heard afterward,--charged the 14th New\r\nYork Chasseurs, in the woods; and the Chasseurs, though retiring, have\r\nfired upon it with such precision as to throw some of their assailants\r\ninto disorder.\r\n\r\n     [Says General Keyes, who had kept on down the Run, \"on the extreme\r\n     left of our advance--having separated from Sherman on his right:--I\r\n     thought the day was won about 2 o'clock; but about half past 3\r\n     o'clock a sudden change in the firing took place, which, to my ear,\r\n     was very ominous.  I knew that the moment the shout went up from\r\n     the other side, there appeared to be an instantaneous change in the\r\n     whole sound of the battle.  * * *  That, as far as I can learn, was\r\n     the shout that went up from the Enemy's line when they found out\r\n     for certain that it was Johnston [Kirby Smith] and not Patterson,\r\n     that had come.\"]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile McDowell is making one more effort to retrieve the misfortunes\r\nof the day.  Lawrence's 5th, and Clark's 11th Massachusetts, with\r\nGorman's 1st Minnesota,--all belonging to Franklin's Brigade--together\r\nwith Corcoran's 69th New York, of Sherman's Brigade, have been brought\r\ninto line-of-battle, by the united efforts of Franklin, Averell, and\r\nother officers, at our centre, and with the remnants of two or three\r\nother regiments, are moving against the Enemy's centre, to support the\r\nattack of the Chasseurs-rallied and led forward again by Heintzelman\r\nupon the Rebel left, and that of the 38th New York upon the Rebel left\r\ncentre,--in another effort to recapture the abandoned batteries.\r\n\r\nCharge after charge, is made by our gallant regiments, and\r\ncounter-charge after counter-charge, is made by the fresh troops of the\r\nEnemy. For almost half an hour, has the contest over the batteries\r\nrolled backward and forward.  Three several times have the batteries\r\nbeen taken, and re-taken,--much of the determined and desperate struggle\r\ngoing on, over the prostrate and bleeding bodies of the brave Union\r\nartillerists,--but without avail.  Regiment after regiment, has been\r\nthrown back, by the deadly fusillade of the Enemy's musketry from the\r\nskirt of woods at his front and left, and the canister, case, and\r\nbursting shells, of his rapidly-served Artillery.\r\n\r\nIt is now near upon 4 o'clock.  Our last effort to recapture the\r\nbatteries has failed.  The Union line of advance has been seriously\r\nchecked.  Some of our own guns in those batteries are turned on us.  The\r\nEnemy's Infantry make a rush over the blood-soaked brow of the fatal\r\nplateau, pouring into our men a deadly fire, as they advance,--while\r\nover to our right and rear, at the same moment, are seen the fresh\r\nregiments of Early's Brigade coming out of the woods--deploying rapidly\r\nin several lines--with Stuart's handful of Rebel Cavalry, while\r\nBeckham's guns, in the same quarter, open an oblique enfilading reverse\r\nfire upon us, in a lively manner.\r\n\r\nAt once the minds of the fagged-out Union troops become filled with the\r\ndispiriting idea that the exhausting fight which they have made all day\r\nlong, has been simply with Beauregard's Army of the Potomac, and that\r\nthese fresh Rebel troops, on the Union right and rear, are the vanguard\r\nof Johnston's Army of the Shenandoah!  After all the hard marching and\r\nfighting they have done during the last thirteen hours,--with empty\r\nstomachs, and parched lips, under a scorching sun that still, as it\r\ndescends in the West, glowers down upon them, through the murky air,\r\nlike a great, red, glaring eye,--the very thought is terrible!\r\n\r\nWithout fear, yet equally without hope, the Union troops crumble to\r\ngroups, and then to individuals.  The attempt of McDowell to turn the\r\nleft of the Enemy's Bull Run line, has failed.\r\n\r\nMcDowell and his officers heroically but vainly strive, at great\r\npersonal risk to themselves, to stem the tide of confusion, and\r\ndisorder.  Sykes's battalion of regulars, which has been at our left,\r\nnow steadily moves obliquely across the field of battle toward our\r\nright, to a hill in the midground, which it occupies, and, with the aid\r\nof Arnold's Battery and Palmer's Cavalry, holds, while the exhausted and\r\ndisorganized troops of the Union Army doggedly and slowly retire toward\r\nSudley Ford, their rear covered by an irregular square of Infantry,\r\nwhich, mainly by the exertions of Colonel Corcoran, has been formed to\r\nresist a threatened charge of Stuart's Cavalry.\r\n\r\n     [At the rate of \"not more than two, or two and a half, miles an\r\n     hour,\" and not \"helter-skelter,\" as some narrators state.]\r\n\r\nIt is not fear, that has got the better of our Union troops.  It is\r\nphysical exhaustion for one thing; it is thirst for another.  Men must\r\ndrink,--even if they have foolishly thrown away their canteens,--and\r\nmany have retired to get water.  It is the moral effect also--the\r\nterrible disappointment--of seeing what they suppose are Johnston's\r\nfresh troops from the Shenandoah Valley, without Patterson \"on their\r\nheels,\" suddenly appear on their flank and rear.  It is not fear; though\r\nsome of them are panic-stricken, and, as they catch sight of Stuart's\r\nmounted men,--no black horse or uniform among them,--raise the cry of\r\n\"The Black Horse Cavalry!--The Black Horse Cavalry!\"\r\n\r\nThe Union attack has been repulsed, it is true; but the Union soldiers,\r\nthough disorganized, discouraged, and disappointed, are not dismayed.\r\nTheir officers not yet having learned how to fight, and themselves\r\nlacking the cohesion of discipline, the men have lost their regimental\r\norganizations, and owing to the causes mentioned, slowly retire across\r\nSudley Ford of Bull Run, in a condition of disintegration, their retreat\r\nbeing bravely covered by the 27th and 69th New York, (which have rallied\r\nand formed there), Sykes's Infantry battalion, Arnold's Battery, and\r\nPalmer's Cavalry.\r\n\r\n     [In his report to Major Barnard, Capt. D. P.  Woodbury, of the\r\n     corps of Engineers, says: \"It is not for me to give a history of\r\n     the battle.  The Enemy was driven on our left, from cover to cover,\r\n     a mile and a half.  Our position for renewing the action the next\r\n     morning was excellent; whence, then, our failure?  It will not be\r\n     out of place, I hope, for me to give my own opinion of the cause of\r\n     this failure.  An old soldier feels safe in the ranks, unsafe out\r\n     of the ranks, and the greater the danger the more pertinaciously he\r\n     clings to his place.  The volunteer of three months never attains\r\n     this instinct of discipline.  Under danger, and even under mere\r\n     excitement, he flies away from his ranks, and looks for safety in\r\n     dispersion.  At four o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st, there\r\n     were more than twelve thousand volunteers on the battle-field of\r\n     Bull Run, who had entirely lost their regimental organizations.\r\n     They could no longer be handled as troops, for the officers and men\r\n     were not together.  Men and officers mingled together\r\n     promiscuously; and it is worthy of remark that this disorganization\r\n     did not result from defeat or fear, for up to four o'clock we had\r\n     been uniformly successful.  The instinct of discipline, which keeps\r\n     every man in his place, had not been acquired.  We cannot suppose\r\n     that the troops of the Enemy had attained a higher degree of\r\n     discipline than our own, but they acted on the defensive, and were\r\n     not equally exposed to disorganization.\"]\r\n\r\nWhile the divisions of Hunter and Heintzelman, which came down in the\r\nmorning across Sudley Ford, are now, with one brigade (Sherman's) of\r\nTyler's Division, retiring again, in this disordered condition, by that\r\nford; two other brigades of Tyler's Division, viz., that of Schenck\r\n--which, at 4 o'clock, was just in the act of advancing upon, and across,\r\nthe Stone Bridge, to join in the Union attack, and of Keyes, which was,\r\nat the same time, just succeeding in its effort to turn the right flank\r\nof the Enemy's third new line,--are withdrawing from the field, across\r\nBull Run stream, by the Warrenton Pike, and other roads leading them\r\ndirectly toward Centreville.  The brigades of both Keyes and Schenck are\r\nretiring in good order; that of Keyes, at \"an ordinary pace,\" following\r\nclose after McDowell, who, with his staff, has ridden across the\r\nbattlefield and Bull Run; while part of that of Schenck, united with the\r\n2nd Maine (of Keyes' Brigade) and Ayres's Battery, \"promptly and\r\neffectively\" repulses a charge of the Enemy's Cavalry, and covers the\r\nrear of Tyler's Division.  Both of these brigades reach Centreville,\r\nhungry and weary, but otherwise, for the most part, in good shape.\r\n\r\nBut during this grand all-day attack, by two of McDowell's divisions,\r\ndirectly aided by part of a third, upon the left of the Enemy's original\r\nBull Run line of defense--which attack, while it has failed in its\r\npurpose, has also utterly upset and defeated the Enemy's purpose to\r\ncarry out Beauregard's plan of attacking Centreville that same morning\r\n--what has the Left Wing of McDowell's Army been doing?  Let us go back\r\nto Sunday morning, and ascertain:\r\n\r\nAll the Army of McDowell, save his Left Wing--which, comprising the two\r\nbrigades (Blenker's and Davies's) of Miles's Division, and Richardson's\r\nBrigade of Tyler's Division that fought the preliminary battle of\r\nBlackburn's Ford, is now under the command of Miles,--moved away from\r\nCentreville, down the Warrenton Pike, as we have seen, very early in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nBlenker remains with his brigade as a reserve, on the heights a little\r\nEast of Centreville, to throw up intrenchments; which, however, he does\r\nnot do, for lack of trenching implements.  Richardson and Davies are to\r\nmake a feint, at Blackburn's Ford, so as to draw the Enemy's troops\r\nthere, while the heavy blow of McDowell's Right Wing and Centre falls\r\nupon the left flank and rear of the Enemy's Bull Run line.\r\n\r\nRichardson's Brigade is already down the ridge, in his old position at\r\nBlackburn's Ford, when Davies with his brigade reaches it, from\r\nCentreville, and, by virtue of seniority, takes command of the two\r\nbrigades.  Leaving Richardson's Brigade and Greene's Battery exactly on\r\nthe battle-ground of the 18th July, Davies posts two regiments (the 18th\r\nand 32nd New York) of his own brigade, with Hunt's Battery, on the brow\r\nof a hill, in an open wheat field, some eighty yards to the\r\nSouth-Eastward of Richardson, distant some 1,500 yards from Longstreet's\r\nbatteries on the Western side of Bull Run,--and commences a rapid fire,\r\nupon the Enemy's position at Blackburn's Ford, from both of the Union\r\nbatteries.\r\n\r\nAt 10 o'clock, there is a lull in this Union fire.  The Artillery\r\nammunition is running short.  The demonstration, however, seems, thus\r\nfar, to be successful--judging by the movement of Rebel troops toward\r\nBlackburn's Ford.  The lull continues until 11 o'clock.  At that time\r\nMiles arrives at his front, in a towering rage.\r\n\r\nOn his way down the ridge, that morning, early, Davies had made a\r\ndiscovery.  While passing a roadway, his guide had casually remarked:\r\n\"There is a road that leads around to the Enemy's camp, direct.\"  \"Ah!\"\r\n--said Davies--\"and can they get through that road?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" replied\r\nthe guide.  Davies had at once halted, and, after posting his 16th and\r\n31st New York Regiments, with two guns of Hunt's Battery, near this\r\nroad, at its junction with the ridge road running up to Centreville and\r\nBlack burn's Ford, had proceeded, with the rest of his regiments and\r\nguns, to the position where Miles finds him.\r\n\r\nBut Miles has discovered what Davies has done, in this matter of the\r\nflanking roadway; and--without knowing, or apparently caring to know,\r\nthe reason underlying the posting of the two regiments and two guns in\r\nits vicinity,--flies into \"a terrible passion\" because of it; in \"no\r\nvery measured language,\" gives Davies \"a severe dressing down;\" and\r\norders him to bring both regiments and guns down to the front.  Davies\r\ncomplies, and says nothing.  Miles also orders him to continue the\r\nfiring from his batteries, without regard to the quantity of ammunition.\r\nThis order, also, Davies obeys--and the firing proceeds, for two solid\r\nhours, until another order comes, about 1 o'clock P.M., to stop firing.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that Miles is not at all himself--but is suffering under\r\nsuch a strain of mental excitement, he afterward claims, that he is not\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nMiles, however, returns to Centreville about noon; and no sooner is he\r\ngone, than Davies at once sends back pioneers to obstruct that road\r\nwhich would bring the Enemy around his left flank and rear, to\r\nCentreville.  These, work so industriously, that they cut down a quarter\r\nof a mile of trees, and block the road up completely.  Davies also posts\r\na few pickets there, in case of accidents.  It is well he does so.  It\r\nis not long before the Enemy makes an attempt to get around to his rear,\r\nby that road; but, finding it both obstructed and picketed, retires\r\nagain.  Davies does not see the Rebels making that attempt, but catches\r\nsight of them on their return, and gives them a severe shelling for\r\ntheir pains.\r\n\r\nDavies keeps up his firing, more or less-according to the condition of\r\nthe Enemy and of his own ammunition--until 4 o'clock, when the firing\r\noccasioned by the Union flanking movement, six miles to his right,\r\nceases.  Then there reaches him a note from Richardson, so badly\r\npenciled that he can only make out the one word \"beaten,\"--but cannot,\r\nfor the life of him, make out, whether the beaten one is our Right Wing,\r\nor the Enemy!\r\n\r\nOf what followed, he tells the story himself,--under oath, before the\r\nCommittee on the Conduct of the War--so graphically, that the temptation\r\nto give it, in his own words, is irresistible.  \"I saw unmistakable\r\nevidence,\" said he, \"that we were going to be attacked on our Left Wing.\r\nI got all ready for the attack, but did not change my front.\r\n\r\n\"About 5 o'clock, I think, the Rebels made their appearance back upon\r\nthis very road up which they had gone before; but instead of keeping up\r\nthe road, they turned past a farm-house, went through the farm-yard, and\r\ncame down and formed right in front of me, in a hollow, out of my sight.\r\nWell, I let them all come down there, keeping a watch upon their\r\nmovements.  I told the Artillery not to fire any shot at them until they\r\nsaw the rear column go down, so as to get them all down in the little\r\nhollow or basin, there.  There was a little basin there, probably a\r\nquarter of a mile every way.  I should think that, maybe, 3,000 men\r\nfiled down, before I changed front.\r\n\r\n\"We lay there, with two regiments back, and the Artillery in front,\r\nfacing Bull Run.  As soon as about 3,000 of the Enemy got down in this\r\nbasin, I changed the front of the Artillery around to the left, in face\r\nof the Enemy, and put a company of Infantry between each of the pieces\r\nof Artillery, and then deployed the balance of the regiments right and\r\nleft, and made my line-of-battle.\r\n\r\n\"I gave directions to the Infantry not to fire a shot, under any\r\ncircumstances, until they got the word of command from me.  I\r\nfurthermore said I would shoot the first man that fired a shot before I\r\ngave the command to do so.\r\n\r\n\"I gave them orders all to lie down on their faces.  They, (the Rebels)\r\nwere just over the brow of the hill, so that, if they came up in front\r\nof us, they could not hit a man.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I saw the rear column, I told * * * Lieutenant Benjamin to\r\nfire.  * * *  He fired the first shot when the rear column presented\r\nitself.  It just went over their heads, and hit a horse and rider in\r\ntheir rear.  As soon as the first shot was fired, I gave the order for\r\nthe whole six pieces of Artillery to open with grape and canister.  The\r\neffect was terrible.  They were all there, right before us, about 450\r\nyards off, and had not suspected that we were going to fire at all,\r\nthough they did not know what the reason was.  Hunt's Battery (belonging\r\nto Richardson--who had by mistake got Greene's) performed so well, that,\r\nin thirty minutes, we dispersed every one of them!\r\n\r\n\"I do not know how many were killed, but we so crippled their entire\r\nforce that they never came after us an inch.  A man, who saw the effect\r\nof the firing, in the valley, said it was just like firing into a wheat\r\nfield; the column gave way at once, before the grape and canister; they\r\nwere just within available distance.  I knew very well that if they but\r\ngot into that basin, the first fire would cut them all to pieces; and it\r\ndid.  We continued to fire for thirty minutes, when there was nothing\r\nmore to fire at, and no more shots were returned.\"\r\n\r\nAt a later hour--while remaining victorious at their well defended\r\nposition, with the Enemy at their front, dispersed and silenced,--these\r\ntwo brigades of the Left Wing, receive orders to fall back on\r\nCentreville, and encamp.  With the brigade of Richardson, and Greene's\r\nBattery in advance, Davies's own brigade and Hunt's Battery following,\r\nthey fall back on the heights of Centreville \"without the least\r\nconfusion and in perfect order\"--reaching them at 7 P.M.\r\n\r\nMeantime Miles has been relieved from command, and McDowell has ordered\r\nBlenker's Brigade to take position a mile or more in advance of\r\nCentreville, toward Bull Run, on both sides of the Warrenton Pike, to\r\nprotect the retreat, now being made, in \"a few collected bodies,\" but\r\nmainly in great disorder--owing partly to the baggage-wagons choking the\r\nroad, along which both venturesome civilians and fagged-out troops are\r\nretreating upon Centreville.  This confused retreat passes through\r\nBlenker's lines until 9 o'clock P.M.--and then, all is secure.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, McDowell has decided to make no stand at Centreville, but\r\nto retire upon the defensive works at Washington.  The order to retreat,\r\nis given, and, with the rear well guarded by Richardson's and Blenker's\r\nBrigades, is carried out, the van of the retreat, with no Enemy\r\npursuing, degenerating finally into a \"mob,\" which carries more or less\r\npanic into Washington itself, as well as terrible disappointment and\r\nchagrin to all the Loyal States of the Union.\r\n\r\nKnowing what we now do, concerning the Battle of Bull Run, it is\r\nsomewhat surprising, at this day, to read the dispatches sent by\r\nMcDowell to General Scott's headquarters at Washington, immediately\r\nafter it.  They are in these words:\r\n\r\n               \"CENTREVILLE, July 21, 1861--5:45 P.M.\r\n\r\n\"We passed Bull Run, engaged the Enemy, who, it seems, had just been\r\nre-enforced by General Johnston.  We drove them for several hours, and\r\nfinally routed them.\"\r\n\r\n     [\"No one who did not share in the sad experience will be able to\r\n     realize the consternation which the news of this discomfiture\r\n     --grossly exaggerated--diffused over the loyal portion of our\r\n     Country.  Only the tidings which had reached Washington up to four\r\n     o'clock--all presaging certain and decisive victory--were permitted\r\n     to go North by telegraph that day and evening; so that, on Monday\r\n     morning, when the crowd of fugitives from our grand Army was\r\n     pouring into Washington, a heedless, harmless, worthless mob, the\r\n     Loyal States were exulting over accounts of a decisive triumph.\r\n     But a few hours brought different advices; and these were as much\r\n     worse than the truth as the former had been better: our Army had\r\n     been utterly destroyed-cut to pieces, with a loss of twenty-five to\r\n     thirty thousand men, besides all its artillery and munitions, and\r\n     Washington lay at the mercy of the Enemy, who were soon to advance\r\n     to the capture and sack of our great commercial cities.  Never\r\n     before had so black a day as that black Monday lowered upon the\r\n     loyal hearts of the North; and the leaden, weeping skies reflected\r\n     and heightened, while they seemed to sympathize with, the general\r\n     gloom.  It would have been easy, with ordinary effort and care, to\r\n     have gathered and remanded to their camps or forts around\r\n     Alexandria or Arlington, all the wretched stragglers to whom fear\r\n     had lent wings, and who, throwing away their arms and equipments,\r\n     and abandoning all semblance of Military order or discipline, had\r\n     rushed to the Capital to hide therein their shame, behind a cloud\r\n     of exaggerations and falsehoods.  The still effective batteries,\r\n     the solid battalions, that were then wending their way slowly back\r\n     to their old encampments along the South bank of the Potomac,\r\n     depressed but unshaken, dauntless and utterly unassailed, were\r\n     unseen and unheard from; while the panic-stricken racers filled and\r\n     distended the general ear with their tales of impregnable\r\n     intrenchments and masked batteries, of regiments slaughtered,\r\n     brigades utterly cut to pieces, etc., making out their miserable\r\n     selves to be about all that was left of the Army.  That these men\r\n     were allowed thus to straggle into Washington, instead of being\r\n     peremptorily stopped at the bridges and sent back to the\r\n     encampments of their several regiments, is only to be accounted for\r\n     on the hypothesis that the reason of our Military magnates had been\r\n     temporarily dethroned, so as to divest them of all moral\r\n     responsibility,\" Greeley's Am. Conflict, pp.  552-53., vol. I.]\r\n\r\n\"They rallied and repulsed us, but only to give us again the victory,\r\nwhich seemed complete.  But our men, exhausted with fatigue and thirst,\r\nand confused by firing into each other, were attacked by the Enemy's\r\nreserves, and driven from the position we had gained, overlooking\r\nManassas.  After this, the men could not be rallied, but slowly left the\r\nfield.  In the meantime the Enemy outflanked Richardson at Blackburn's\r\nFord, and we have now to hold Centreville till our men can get behind\r\nit.  Miles's Division is holding the town.  It is reported that Colonel\r\nCameron is killed, Hunter and Heintzelman wounded, neither dangerously.\r\n                         \"IRWIN MCDOWELL,\r\n                    \"Brigadier-General, Commanding.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant-Colonel TOWNSEND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"FAIRFAX COURT HOUSE, July 21, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"The men having thrown away their haversacks in the battle, and left\r\nthem behind, they are without food; have eaten nothing since breakfast.\r\nWe are without artillery ammunition.  The larger part of the men are a\r\nconfused mob, entirely demoralized.  It was the opinion of all the\r\ncommanders that no stand could be made this side of the Potomac.  We\r\nwill, however, make the attempt at Fairfax Court House.  From a prisoner\r\nwe learn that 20,000 from Johnston joined last night, and they march on\r\nus to-night.\r\n                              \"IRWIN MCDOWELL.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel TOWNSEND\"\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"FAIRFAX COURT HOUSE, [July] 22, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"Many of the volunteers did not wait for authority to proceed to the\r\nPotomac, but left on their own decision.  They are now pouring through\r\nthis place in a state of utter disorganization.  They could not be\r\nprepared for action by to-morrow morning even were they willing.  I\r\nlearn from prisoners that we are to be pressed here to-night and\r\ntomorrow morning, as the Enemy's force is very large, and they are\r\nelated.  I think we heard cannon on our rear-guard.  I think now, as all\r\nof my commanders thought at Centreville, there is no alternative but to\r\nfall back to the Potomac, and I shall proceed to do so with as much\r\nregularity as possible.\r\n                                   \"IRWIN MCDOWELL.\r\n\r\n\"Colonel TOWNSEND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"ARLINGTON, July 22, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"I avail myself of the re-establishing of telegraph to report my\r\narrival.

Had not been\r\nattacked.  I am now trying to get matters a little organized over here.\r\n                         \"IRWIN MCDOWELL.\r\n                         \"Brigadier-General.\r\n\"E. D. TOWNSEND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMcDowell had unquestionably been repulsed, in his main attack, with his\r\nRight Wing, and much of his Army was badly demoralized; but, on the\r\nother hand, it may be well to repeat that the Enemy's plan of attack\r\nthat same morning had been frustrated, and most of his forces so badly\r\nshattered and demoralized that he dared not follow up the advantage\r\nwhich, more by our own blunders than by his prowess, he had gained.\r\n\r\nIf the Union forces--or at least the Right Wing of them--were whipped,\r\nthe Enemy also was whipped.  Jackson himself confesses that while he\r\nhad, at the last moment, broken our centre, our forces had turned both\r\nof his flanks.  The Enemy was, in fact, so badly used up, that he not\r\nonly dared not pursue us to Washington--as he would have down had he\r\nbeen able--but he was absolutely afraid McDowell would resume the\r\nattack, on the right of the original Bull Run line, that very night!\r\nFor, in a letter to General Beauregard; dated Richmond, Virginia, August\r\n4, 1861, Jefferson Davis,--who was on the ground at Bull Run, July\r\n21st,--alluding to the Battle of Bull Run, and Beauregard's excuses for\r\nnot pursuing the Union troops, says:\r\n\r\n\"I think you are unjust to yourself in putting your failure to pursue\r\nthe Enemy to Washington, to the account of short supplies of subsistence\r\nand transportation.  Under the circumstances of our Army, and in the\r\nabsence of the knowledge since acquired--if, indeed, the statements be\r\ntrue--it would have been extremely hazardous to have done more than was\r\nperformed.  You will not fail to remember that, so far from knowing that\r\nthe Enemy was routed, a large part of our forces was moved by you, in\r\nthe night of the 21st, to repel a supposed attack upon our right, and\r\nthe next day's operations did not fully reveal what has since been\r\nreported of the Enemy's panic.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jefferson Davis's statement is corroborated by the Report of Colonel\r\nWithers, of the 18th Virginia, who, after starting with other regiments,\r\nin an attempt to cut off the Union retreat, was recalled to the Stone\r\nBridge,--and who says: \"Before reaching the point we designed to occupy\r\n(near the Stone Bridge) we were met by another order to march\r\nimmediately to Manassas Junction, as an attack was apprehended that\r\nnight.  Although it was now after sunset, and my men had had no food all\r\nday, when the command to march to Manassas was given, they cheerfully\r\ntook the route to that place.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Davies, who, as we have seen, commanded McDowell's stubborn Left\r\nWing, was after all, not far wrong, when, in his testimony before the\r\nCommittee on the Conduct of the War, he declared, touching the story of\r\nthe Bull Run Battle: \"It ought to have read that we were victorious with\r\nthe 13,000 troops of the Left Wing, and defeated in the 18,000 of the\r\nRight Wing.  That is all that Bull Run amounts to.\"\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, the Battle of Bull Run--the first pitched battle of\r\nthe War--was a drawn battle.\r\n\r\nWar was now fully inaugurated--Civil War--a stupendous War between two\r\ngreat Sections of one common Country; those of our People, on the one\r\nside, fighting for the dissolution of the Union--and incidentally for\r\nFree Trade, and for Slavery; those on the other side, fighting for the\r\npreservation of the Union--and incidentally for Protection to our Free\r\nIndustries, and for the Freedom of the Slave.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Republican Party controlled both Houses of Congress it\r\nprovided Protection to our Free Industries, and to the Free Labor\r\nengaged in them, by the Morill Tariff Act of 1860--the foundation Act of\r\nall subsequent enactments on the subject.  In subsequent pages of this\r\nwork we shall see how the Freedom of the Slave was also accomplished by\r\nthe same great Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                        THE COLORED CONTRABAND.\r\n\r\nWhen the first gun was fired at Fort Sumter, its sullen echoes sounded\r\nthe funeral knell of Slavery.  Years before, it had been foretold, and\r\nnow it was to happen. Years before, it had been declared, by competent\r\nauthority, that among the implications of the Constitution was that of\r\nthe power of the General Government to Emancipate the Slaves, as a War\r\nmeasure.  Hence, in thus commencing the War of the Rebellion, the South\r\nmarched with open eyes upon this, as among other of the legitimate and\r\nlogical results of such a War.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry, in opposing the ratification by Virginia of the Federal\r\nConstitution, had declared to the Slaveholders of that State that \"Among\r\nten thousand implied powers\" which Congress may assume, \"they may, if we\r\nbe engaged in War, liberate every one of your Slaves, if they please, *\r\n* * Have they not power to provide for the General Defense and Welfare?\r\nMay they not think that these call for the abolition of Slavery?  May\r\nthey not pronounce all Slaves Free? and will they not be warranted by\r\nthat power?  * * *  They have the power, in clear, unequivocal terms,\r\nand will clearly and certainly exercise it.\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, in his great speech of May 25, 1836, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, John Quincy Adams had declared that in \"the last great\r\nconflict which must be fought between Slavery and Emancipation,\"\r\nCongress \"must and will interfere\" with Slavery, \"and they will not only\r\npossess the Constitutional power so to interfere, but they will be bound\r\nin duty to do it, by the express provisions of the Constitution itself.\"\r\nAnd he followed this declaration with the equally emphatic words: \"From\r\nthe instant that your Slave-holding States become the theatre of War\r\n--civil, servile, or foreign--from that instant, the War powers of\r\nCongress extend to interference with the Institution of Slavery in every\r\nWay by which it can be interfered with.\"\r\n\r\nThe position thus announced by these expounders of the Constitution--the\r\none from Virginia, the other from Massachusetts--was not to be shaken\r\neven by the unanimous adoption, February 11, 1861, by the House of\r\nRepresentatives on roll call, of the resolution of Mr. Sherman, of Ohio,\r\nin these words:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That neither the Congress of the United States nor the people\r\nor governments of the non-Slaveholding States have the Constitutional\r\nright to legislate upon or interfere with Slavery in any of the\r\nSlaveholding States in the Union.\"\r\n\r\nEx-President J. Q. Adams's cogent exposition of the Constitution,\r\ntwenty-five years before, in that same House, demonstrating not only\r\nthat Congress had the right but the Constitutional power to so\r\ninterfere--and his further demonstration April 15, 1842, of his\r\nstatement that under the laws of War, \"when a Country is invaded, and\r\ntwo hostile armies are set in martial array, the Commanders of both\r\nArmies have power to Emancipate all the Slaves in the invaded\r\nterritory\"--as not to be overcome by a mere vote of one House, however\r\nunanimous.  For the time being, however, it contributed, with other\r\ncircumstances, to confuse the public mind and conscience.  Indeed as\r\nearly as May of 1861, the attitude of our Government and its troops\r\ntoward Negro Slaves owned or used by Rebels in rebellious States, began\r\nto perturb the public, bother the Administration, and worry the Military\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in Major-General McClellan's proclamation to the Union men\r\nof West Virginia, issued May 26, 1861, he said:\r\n\r\n\"The General Government cannot close its ears to the demand you have\r\nmade for assistance.  I have ordered troops to cross the river.  They\r\ncome as your friends and brothers--as enemies only to armed Rebels, who\r\nare preying upon you; your homes, your families, and your property are\r\nsafe under our protection.  All your rights shall be religiously\r\nrespected, notwithstanding all that has been said by the Traitors to\r\ninduce you to believe our advent among you will be signalized by an\r\ninterference with your Slaves.  Understand one thing clearly: not only\r\nwill we abstain from all such interference, but we will, on the\r\ncontrary, with an iron hand crush any attempt at insurrection on their\r\npart.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the very next day, May 27, 1861, Major-General\r\nButler, in command of the \"Department of  A Virginia,\" wrote to\r\nLieutenant-General Scott as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Since I wrote my last dispatch the question in regard to Slave property\r\nis becoming one of very serious magnitude.  The inhabitants of Virginia\r\nare using their Negroes in the batteries, and are preparing to send the\r\nwomen and children South.  The escapes from them are very numerous, and\r\na squad has come in this morning to my pickets bringing their women and\r\nchildren.  Of course these cannot be dealt with upon the theory on which\r\nI designed to treat the services of able-bodied men and women who might\r\ncome within my lines, and of which I gave you a detailed account in my\r\nlast dispatch.  I am in the utmost doubt what to do with this species of\r\nProperty.\r\n\r\n\"Up to this time I have had come within my lines men and women with\r\ntheir children, entire families, each family belonging to the same\r\nowner.  I have, therefore, determined to employ, as I can do very\r\nprofitably, the able-bodied persons in the party, issuing proper food\r\nfor the support of all, and charging against their services the expense\r\nof care and sustenance of the non-laborers, keeping a strict and\r\naccurate account as well of the services as of the expenditure, having\r\nthe worth of the services, and the cost of the expenditure, determined\r\nby a Board of Survey, to be hereafter detailed.  I know of no other\r\nmanner in which to dispose of this subject and the questions connected\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of Property to the Insurgents, it will be of very great\r\nmoment, the number that I now have amounting, as I am informed, to what,\r\nin good times, would be of the value of sixty thousand dollars.  Twelve\r\nof these Negroes, I am informed, have escaped from the batteries on\r\nSewall's Point, which, this morning, fired upon my expedition as it\r\npassed by out of range.  As a means of offense, therefore, in the\r\nEnemy's hands, these Negroes, when able-bodied, are of the last\r\nimportance.  Without them the batteries could not have been erected, at\r\nleast for many weeks.\r\n\r\n\"As a Military question it would seem to be a measure of necessity to\r\ndeprive their masters of their services.  How can this be done?  As a\r\npolitical question and a question of humanity, can I receive the\r\nservices of a father and mother, and not take the children?  Of the\r\nhumanitarian aspect I have no doubt.  Of the political one I have no\r\nright to judge.  I therefore submit all this to your better judgment,\r\nand as the questions have a political aspect, I have ventured, and I\r\ntrust I am not wrong in so doing, to duplicate the parts of my dispatch\r\nrelating to this subject, and forward them to the Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to the duplicate copy of this letter received by him, Secretary\r\nCameron thus answered:\r\n\r\n                         \"WASHINGTON, May 30, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"SIR: Your action in respect to the Negroes who came within your lines\r\nfrom the service of the Rebels is approved.  The Department is sensible\r\nof the embarrassments which must surround officers conducting Military\r\noperations in a State by the laws of which Slavery is sanctioned.\r\n\r\n\"The Government cannot recognize the rejection by any State of the\r\nFederal obligations, nor can it refuse the performance of the Federal\r\nobligations resting upon itself.  Among these Federal obligations,\r\nhowever, none can be more important than that of suppressing and\r\ndispersing armed combinations formed for the purpose of overthrowing its\r\nwhole Constitutional authority.\r\n\r\n\"While, therefore, you will permit no interference by the persons under\r\nyour command, with the relations of Persons held to Service under the\r\nlaws of any State, you will, on the other hand, so long as any State,\r\nwithin which your Military operations are conducted, is under the\r\ncontrol of such armed combinations, refrain from surrendering to alleged\r\nmasters any Person who may come within your lines.\r\n\r\n\"You will employ such Persons in the services to which they may be best\r\nadapted, keeping an account of the labor by them performed, of the value\r\nof it, and the expenses of their maintenance.  The question of their\r\nfinal disposition will be reserved for future determination.\r\n\r\n                              \"SIMON CAMERON,\r\n                              \"Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\"To Major General BUTLER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat tenderness, however, was exhibited by many of the Union Generals\r\nfor the doomed Institution.  On June 3, 1861, from Chambersburg, Pa., a\r\nproclamation signed \"By order of Major General Patterson, F. J. Porter,\r\nAsst.  Adj. General,\" was issued from \"Headquarters Department of\r\nPennsylvania,\" \"To the United States troops of this Department,\" in\r\nwhich they are admonished \"that, in the coming campaign in Virginia,\r\nwhile it is your duty to punish Sedition, you must protect the Loyal,\r\nand, should the occasion offer, at once suppress Servile Insurrection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"General Orders No. 33,\" issued from \"Headquarters Department of\r\nWashington,\" July 17, 1861, \"By command of Brigadier General Mansfield,\r\nTheo. Talbot, Assistant Adjutant General,\" were to this effect:\r\n\"Fugitive Slaves will under no pretext whatever, be permitted to reside,\r\nor be in any way harbored, in the quarters or camps of the troops\r\nserving in this Department.  Neither will such Slaves be allowed to\r\naccompany troops on the march.  Commanders of troops will be held\r\nresponsible for a strict observance of this order.\"  And early in August\r\na Military order was issued at Washington \"that no Negroes, without\r\nsufficient evidence of their being Free or of their right to travel, are\r\npermitted to leave the city upon the cars.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bull Run did much to settle the Military as well as public mind in\r\nproper grooves on this subject.\r\n\r\nBesides employing Negro Slaves to aid Rebellion, by the digging of\r\nditches, the throwing up of intrenchments, and the erection of\r\nbatteries, their Rebel masters placed in their hands arms with which to\r\nshoot down Union soldiers at the Battle of Bull Run, which, as we have\r\nseen, occurred on Sunday, July 21, 1861--and resulted in a check to the\r\nUnion Cause.\r\n\r\nThe terror and confusion and excitement already referred to, that\r\nprevailed in Washington all that night and the next day, as the\r\npanic-stricken crowd of soldiers and civilians poured over the Long\r\nBridge, footsore with running, faint with weariness, weak with hunger,\r\nand parched with thirst and the dust of the rout, can hardly be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nBut, however panicky the general condition of the inhabitants of the\r\nNational Capital, the Congress bravely maintained its equanimity.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, on the day following the disaster, a bill  touching the\r\nConfiscation of Property used for insurrectionary purposes being up for\r\nconsideration, the following amendment was offered to it:\r\n\r\n\"And be it further enacted, That whenever any person claiming to be\r\nentitled to the Service or Labor of any other Person under the laws of\r\nany State, shall employ such Person in aiding or promoting any\r\nInsurrection, or in resisting the Laws of the United States, or shall\r\npermit him to be so employed, he shall forfeit all right to such Service\r\nor Labor, and the Person whose Labor or Service is thus claimed shall be\r\nthenceforth discharged therefrom, any law to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment, emancipating Slaves employed by their masters to aid\r\nRebellion, was adopted by 33 yeas to 6 nays.\r\n\r\nAs showing the feeling expressed right upon the very heels of what\r\nseemed to be a great disaster, and when rumor, at any rate, placed the\r\nvictorious Enemy at the very gates of the Capital City, a few lines from\r\nthe debate may be interesting.\r\n\r\nMr. Trumbull said: \"I am glad the yeas and nays have been called to let\r\nus see who is willing to vote that the Traitorous owner of a Negro shall\r\nemploy him to shoot down the Union men of the Country, and yet insist\r\nupon restoring him to the Traitor that owns him.  I understand that\r\nNegroes were in the fight which has recently occurred.  I take it that\r\nNegroes who are used to destroy the Union, and to shoot down the Union\r\nmen by the consent of Traitorous masters, ought not to be restored to\r\nthem.  If the Senator from Kentucky is in favor of restoring them, let\r\nhim vote against the amendment.\"\r\n\r\nSenator Wilson, of Massachusetts, said: \"I shall vote with more heart\r\nthan I vote for ordinary measures, for this proposition.  I hope the\r\nSenate and the House of Representatives will sustain it, and that this\r\nGovernment will carry it out with an inflexibility that knows no change.\r\nThe idea that men who are in arms destroying their Country shall be\r\npermitted to use others for that purpose, and that we shall stand by and\r\nissue orders to our Commanders, that we should disgrace our Cause and\r\nour Country, by returning such men to their Traitorous masters, ought\r\nnot longer to be entertained.  The time has come for that to cease; and,\r\nby the blessing of God, so far as I am concerned, I mean it shall cease.\r\n\r\n\"If there is anybody in this Chamber that chooses to take the other\r\npath, let him do it; let him know what our purpose is.  Our purpose is\r\nto save this Government and save this Country, and to put down Treason;\r\nand if Traitors use bondsmen to destroy this Country, my doctrine is\r\nthat the Government shall at once convert these bondsmen into men that\r\ncannot be used to destroy our Country.  I have no apologies to make for\r\nthis position, I take it proudly.\r\n\r\n\"I think the time has come when this Government, and the men who are in\r\narms under the Government, should cease to return to Traitors their\r\nFugitive Slaves, whom they are using to erect batteries to murder brave\r\nmen who are fighting under the flag of their Country.  The time has come\r\nwhen we should deal with the men who are organizing Negro companies, and\r\nteaching them to shoot down loyal men for the only offence of upholding\r\nthe flag of their Country.\r\n\r\n\"I hope further, Sir, that there is a public sentiment in this Country\r\nthat will blast men who will rise, in the Senate or out it, to make\r\napologies for Treason, or to defend or to maintain the doctrine that\r\nthis Government is bound to protect Traitors in converting their Slaves\r\ninto tools for the destruction of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\nSenator McDougall, of California, said: \"I regard this as a Confiscation\r\nfor Treason, and I am for the proposition.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ten Eyck, said: \"No longer ago than Saturday last I voted in the\r\nJudiciary Committee against this amendment, for two reasons: First, I\r\ndid not believe that persons in Rebellion against this Government would\r\nmake use of such means as the employment of Persons held to Labor or\r\nService, in their Armies; secondly, because I did not know what was to\r\nbecome of these poor wretches if they were discharged.  God knows we do\r\nnot want them in our Section of the Union.  But, Sir, having learned and\r\nbelieving that these persons have been employed with arms in their hands\r\nto shed the blood of the Union-loving men of this Country, I shall now\r\nvote in favor of that amendment with less regard to what may become of\r\nthese people than I had on Saturday.  I will merely instance that there\r\nis a precedent for this.  If I recollect history aright, General\r\nJackson, in the Seminole War, declared that every Slave who was taken in\r\narms against the United States should be set Free.\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, in the House of Representatives, the retrograde of a badly\r\ndemoralized Army, its routed fragments still coming in with alarming\r\nstories of a pursuing Enemy almost at the gates of the city, had no\r\nterrors for our legislators; and there was something of Roman dignity,\r\npatriotism, and courage, in the adoption, on that painfully memorable\r\nBlue Monday, (the first--[Offered by Mr. Crittenden, of Kentucky]--with\r\nonly two dissenting votes, on a yea and nay vote; and, the second\r\n--[Offered by Mr. Vandever, of Iowa.]--with entire unanimity) of the\r\nfollowing Resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United\r\nStates, That the present deplorable Civil War has been forced upon the\r\nCountry by the Disunionists of the Southern States, now in arms against\r\nthe Constitutional Government, and in arms around the Capital; that in\r\nthis National emergency, Congress, banishing all feelings of mere\r\npassion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to the whole\r\nCountry; that this War is not waged on their part in any spirit of\r\noppression, or for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, or purpose of\r\noverthrowing or interfering with the rights or established Institutions\r\nof those States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the\r\nConstitution, and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality,\r\nand rights of the several States unimpaired; and that as soon as these\r\nobjects are accomplished, the War ought to cease.\"\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the maintenance of the Constitution, the preservation of\r\nthe Union, and the enforcement of the Laws, are sacred trusts which must\r\nbe executed; that no disaster shall discourage us from the most ample\r\nperformance of this high duty; and that we pledge to the Country and the\r\nWorld, the employment of every resource, National and individual, for\r\nthe suppression, overthrow, and punishment of Rebels in arms.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of these Resolutions was intended to calm the fears of the\r\nBorder States--excited by Rebel emissaries; the second, to restore\r\nconfidence and courage to the patriot hearts of Union-men, everywhere.\r\nBoth were effectual.\r\n\r\nAnd here it will hardly be amiss to glance, for an instant, toward the\r\nSenate Chamber; and especially at one characteristic incident.  It was\r\nthe afternoon of August the 1st, 1861,--scarce ten days since the check\r\nto the Union arms at Bull Run; and Breckinridge, of Kentucky, not yet\r\nexpelled from the United States Senate, was making in that Body his\r\ngreat speech against the \"Insurrection and Sedition Bill,\" and upon \"the\r\nsanctity of the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nBaker, of Oregon,--who, as Sumner afterward said: \"with a zeal that\r\nnever tired, after recruiting men drawn by the attraction of his name,\r\nin New York and Philadelphia and elsewhere, held his Brigade in camp,\r\nnear the Capitol, so that he passed easily from one to the other, and\r\nthus alternated the duties of a Senator and a General,\" having reached\r\nthe Capitol, direct from his Brigade-camp, entered the Senate Chamber,\r\nin his uniform, while Breckinridge was speaking.\r\n\r\nWhen the Kentucky Senator \"with Treason in his heart, if not on his\r\nlips,\" resumed his seat, the gray-haired soldier-Senator at once rose to\r\nreply.  \"He began,\"--said Charles Sumner, in alluding to the incident\r\n--\"simply and calmly; but as he proceeded, his fervid soul broke forth in\r\nwords of surpassing power.  As on a former occasion he had presented the\r\nwell-ripened fruits of study, so now he spoke with the spontaneous\r\nutterance of his own mature and exuberant eloquence--meeting the\r\npolished Traitor at every point with weapons keener and brighter than\r\nhis own.\"\r\n\r\nAfter demolishing Breckinridge's position touching the alleged\r\nUnconstitutionality of the measure, and characterizing his other\r\nutterances as \"reproof, malediction, and prediction combined,\" the\r\nPatriot from the Far-West turned with rising voice and flashing eye upon\r\nthe gloomy Kentuckian:\r\n\r\n\"I would ask him,\" said he, \"what would you have us do now--a\r\nConfederate Army within twenty miles of us, advancing, or threatening to\r\nadvance, to overwhelm your Government; to shake the pillars of the\r\nUnion, to bring it around your head, if you stay here, in ruins?  Are we\r\nto stop and talk about an uprising sentiment in the North against the\r\nWar?  Are we to predict evil, and retire from what we predict?  Is it\r\nnot the manly part to go on as we have begun, to raise money, and levy\r\nArmies, to organize them, to prepare to advance; when we do advance, to\r\nregulate that advance by all the laws and regulations that civilization\r\nand humanity will allow in time of battle?  Can we do anything more?  To\r\ntalk to us about stopping, is idle; we will never stop.  Will the\r\nSenator yield to Rebellion?  Will he shrink from armed Insurrection?\r\nWill his State justify it?  Will its better public opinion allow it?\r\nShall we send a flag of Truce?  What would he have?  Or would he conduct\r\nthis War so feebly, that the whole World would smile at us in derision?\"\r\n\r\nAnd then cried the orator-his voice rising to a higher key, penetrating,\r\nyet musical as the blast from a silver trumpet: \"What would he have?\r\nThese speeches of his, sown broadcast over the Land, what clear distinct\r\nmeaning have they?  Are they not intended for disorganization in our\r\nvery midst?  Are they not intended to dull our weapons?  Are they not\r\nintended to destroy our zeal?  Are they not intended to animate our\r\nenemies?  Sir, are they not words of brilliant, polished Treason, even\r\nin the very Capitol of the Nation?\r\n\r\n\"What would have been thought, if, in another Capitol, in another\r\nRepublic, in a yet more martial age, a Senator as grave, not more\r\neloquent or dignified than the Senator from Kentucky, yet with the Roman\r\npurple flowing over his shoulder, had risen in his place, surrounded by\r\nall the illustrations of Roman glory, and declared that the cause of\r\nadvancing Hannibal was just, and that Carthage ought to be dealt with in\r\nterms of peace?  What would have been thought if, after the battle of\r\nCannae, a Senator there had risen in his place and denounced every levy\r\nof the Roman People, every expenditure of its treasure, and every appeal\r\nto the old recollections and the old glories?\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker paused.  The sudden and intent silence was broken by another\r\nvoice: \"He would have been hurled from the Tarpeian rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" continued the soldier-orator, \"a Senator, himself learned far\r\nmore than myself in such lore, [Mr. Fessenden,] tells me, in a voice\r\nthat I am glad is audible, that he would have been hurled from the\r\nTarpeian Rock!  It is a grand commentary upon the American Constitution\r\nthat we permit these words [Senator Breckinridge's] to be uttered.\r\n\r\n\"I ask the Senator to recollect, too, what, save to send aid and comfort\r\nto the Enemy, do these predictions of his amount to?  Every word thus\r\nuttered falls as a note of inspiration upon every Confederate ear.\r\nEvery sound thus uttered is a word, (and, falling from his lips, a\r\nmighty word) of kindling and triumph to a Foe that determines to\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\n\"For me, I have no such word as a Senator, to utter.  For me\"--and here\r\nhis eyes flashed again while his martial voice rang like a clarion-call\r\nto battle--\"amid temporary defeat, disaster, disgrace, it seems that my\r\nduty calls me to utter another word, and that word is, bold, sudden,\r\nforward, determined, WAR, according to the laws of War, by Armies, by\r\nMilitary Commanders clothed with full power, advancing with all the past\r\nglories of the Republic urging them on to conquest!\r\n\r\n                     *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"I tell the Senator,\" continued the inspired Patriot, \"that his\r\npredictions, sometimes for the South, sometimes for the Middle States,\r\nsometimes for the North-East, and then wandering away in airy visions\r\nout to the Far Pacific, about the dread of our people, as for loss of\r\nblood and treasure, provoking them to Disloyalty, are false in\r\nsentiment, false in fact, and false in Loyalty.  The Senator from\r\nKentucky is mistaken in them all.\r\n\r\n\"Five hundred million dollars!  What then?  Great Britain gave more than\r\ntwo thousand million in the great Battle for Constitutional Liberty\r\nwhich she led at one time almost single-handed against the World.  Five\r\nhundred thousand men!  What then?  We have them; they are ours; they are\r\nthe children of the Country; they belong to the whole Country; they are\r\nour sons; our kinsmen; and there are many of us who will give them all\r\nup before we will abate one word of our just demand, or will retreat one\r\ninch from the line which divides right from wrong.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, it is not a question of men or of money in that sense.  All the\r\nmoney, all the men, are, in our judgment, well bestowed in such a cause.\r\nWhen we give them, we know their value.  Knowing their value well, we\r\ngive them with the more pride and the, more joy.  Sir, how can we\r\nretreat?  Sir, how can we make Peace?  Who shall treat?  What\r\nCommissioners?  Who would go?  Upon what terms?  Where is to be your\r\nboundary line?  Where the end of the principles we shall have to give\r\nup?  What will become of Constitutional Government?  What will become of\r\npublic Liberty?  What of past glories?  What of future hopes?\r\n\r\n\"Shall we sink into the insignificance of the grave--a degraded,\r\ndefeated, emasculated People, frightened by the results of one battle,\r\nand scared at the visions raised by the imagination of the Senator from\r\nKentucky on this floor?  No, Sir! a thousand times, no, Sir!  We will\r\nrally--if, indeed, our words be necessary--we will rally the People, the\r\nLoyal People, of the whole Country.  They will pour forth their\r\ntreasure, their money, their men, without stint, without measure.  The\r\nmost peaceable man in this body may stamp his foot upon this Senate\r\nChamber floor, as of old a warrior and a Senator did, and from that\r\nsingle tramp there will spring forth armed Legions.\r\n\r\n\"Shall one battle determine the fate of empire, or a dozen?--the loss of\r\none thousand men, or twenty thousand?  or one hundred million or five\r\nhundred million dollars?  In a year's Peace--in ten years, at most, of\r\npeaceful progress--we can restore them all.  There will be some graves\r\nreeking with blood, watered by the tears of affection.  There will be\r\nsome privation; there will be some loss of luxury; there will be\r\nsomewhat more need for labor to procure the necessaries of life.  When\r\nthat is said, all is said.  If we have the Country, the whole Country,\r\nthe Union, the Constitution, Free Government--with these there will\r\nreturn all the blessings of well-ordered civilization; the path of the\r\nCountry will be a career of greatness and of glory such as, in the olden\r\ntime, our Fathers saw in the dim visions of years yet to come, and such\r\nas would have been ours now, to-day, if it had not been for the Treason\r\nfor which the Senator too often seeks to apologize.\"\r\n\r\nThis remarkable speech was the last utterance of that glorious and\r\ncourageous soul, in the National Senate.  Within three months, his\r\nlifeless body, riddled by Rebel rifle balls, was borne away from the\r\nfatal field of Ball's Bluff--away, amid the lamentations of a Nation\r\n--away, across land and ocean--to lie beside his brave friend Broderick,\r\non that Lone Mountain whose solemn front looks out upon the calm\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nHe had not lived in vain.  In his great speech at the American Theatre\r\nin San Francisco, after his election by Oregon (1860) to represent her\r\nin the United States Senate, he had aroused the people to a sense of\r\nshame, that, as he said: \"Here, in a land of written Constitutional\r\nLiberty it is reserved for us to teach the World that, under the\r\nAmerican Stars and Stripes, Slavery marches in solemn procession; that,\r\nunder the American flag, Slavery is protected to the utmost verge of\r\nacquired territory; that under the American banner, the name of Freedom\r\nis to be faintly heard, the songs of Freedom faintly sung; that, while\r\nGaribaldi, Victor Emanuel, every great and good man in the World,\r\nstrives, struggles, fights, prays, suffers and dies, sometimes on the\r\nscaffold, sometimes in the dungeon, often on the field of battle,\r\nrendered immortal by his blood and his valor; that, while this triumphal\r\nprocession marches on through the arches of Freedom--we, in this land,\r\nof all the World, shrink back trembling when Freedom is but mentioned!\"\r\n\r\nAnd never was a shamed people more suddenly lifted up from that shame\r\ninto a grand frenzy of patriotic devotion than were his auditors, when,\r\nwith the inspiration of his matchless genius, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"As for me, I dare not, will not, be false to Freedom.  Where the feet\r\nof my youth were planted, there, by Freedom, my feet shall ever stand.\r\nI will walk beneath her banner.  I will glory in her strength.  I have\r\nwatched her in history struck down on an hundred chosen fields of\r\nbattle.  I have seen her friends fly from her; her foes gather around\r\nher.  I have seen her bound to the stake; I have seen them give her\r\nashes to the winds.  But when they turned to exult, I have seen her\r\nagain meet them face to face, resplendent in complete steel, brandishing\r\nin her strong right hand a flaming sword, red with Insufferable light!\r\nI take courage.  The People gather around her.  The genius of America\r\nwill, at last, lead her sons to Freedom.\"\r\n\r\nNever were grander utterances delivered by man in all the ages; never\r\nwas there exhibited a more sublime faith; never a truer spirit of\r\nprophecy; never a more heroic spirit.\r\n\r\nHe was then on his way to Washington; on his way to perform the last\r\nacts in the drama of his own career--on his way to death.  He knew the\r\ntime had come, of which, ten years before, he had prophetically spoken\r\nin the House of Representatives, when he said: \"I have only to say that,\r\nif the time should come when Disunion rules the hour, and discord is to\r\nreign supreme, I shall again be ready to give the best blood in my veins\r\nto my Country's Cause.  I shall be prepared to meet all antagonists with\r\nlance in rest, to do battle in every land, in defense of the\r\nConstitution of the Country which I have sworn to support, to the last\r\nextremity, against Disunionists, and all its Enemies, whether of the\r\nSouth or North; to meet them everywhere, at all times, with speech or\r\nhand, with word or blow, until thought and being shall be no longer\r\nmine.\"  And right nobly did he fulfil in all respects his promise; so\r\nthat at the end--as was afterward well said of him by Mr. Colfax--he had\r\nmounted so high, that, \"doubly crowned, as statesman, and as warrior--\r\n\r\n     'From the top of Fame's ladder he stepped to the Sky!'\"\r\n\r\n     [This orator and hero was a naturalized Englishman, and commanded\r\n     an American regiment in the Mexican War.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                         FREEDOM'S EARLY DAWN.\r\n\r\nOn the day following Baker's great reply to Breckinridge, another\r\nnotable speech was made, in the House of Representatives--notable,\r\nespecially, in that it foreshadowed Emancipation, and, coming so soon\r\nafter Bull Run, seemed to accentuate a new departure in political\r\nthought as an outgrowth of that Military reverse.  It was upon the\r\nConfiscation Act, and it was Thaddeus Stevens who made it.  Said he:\r\n\r\n\"If we are justified in taking property from the Enemy in War, when you\r\nhave rescued an oppressed People from the oppression of that Enemy, by\r\nwhat principle of the Law of Nations, by what principle of philanthropy,\r\ncan you return them to the bondage from which you have delivered them,\r\nand again rivet the chains you have once broken?  It is a disgrace to\r\nthe Party which advocates it.  It is against the principle of the Law of\r\nNations.  It is against every principle of philanthropy.  I for one,\r\nshall never shrink from saying when these Slaves are once conquered by\r\nus, 'Go and be Free.'  God forbid that I should ever agree that they\r\nshould be returned again to their masters!  I do not say that this War\r\nis made for that purpose.  Ask those who made the War, what is its\r\nobject.  Do not ask us.  * * *  Our object is to subdue the Rebels.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued he, \"it is said that if we hold out this thing, they\r\nwill never submit--that we cannot conquer them--that they will suffer\r\nthemselves to be slaughtered, and their whole country to be laid waste.\r\nSir, War is a grievous thing at best, and Civil War more than any other;\r\nbut if they hold this language, and the means which they have suggested\r\nmust be resorted to; if their whole country must be laid waste, and made\r\na desert, in order to save this Union from destruction, so let it be.  I\r\nwould rather, Sir, reduce them to a condition where their whole country\r\nis to be re-peopled by a band of freemen than to see them perpetrate the\r\ndestruction of this People through our agency.  I do not say that it is\r\ntime to resort to such means, and I do not know when the time will come;\r\nbut I never fear to express my sentiments.  It is not a question with me\r\nof policy, but a question of principle.\r\n\r\n\"If this War is continued long, and is bloody, I do not believe that the\r\nfree people of the North will stand by and see their sons and brothers\r\nand neighbors slaughtered by thousands and tens of thousands by Rebels,\r\nwith arms in their hands, and forbear to call upon their enemies to be\r\nour friends, and to help us in subduing them; I for one, if it continues\r\nlong, and has the consequences mentioned, shall be ready to go for it,\r\nlet it horrify the gentleman from New York (Mr. Diven) or anybody else.\r\nThat is my doctrine, and that will be the doctrine of the whole free\r\npeople of the North before two years roll round, if this War continues.\r\n\r\n\"As to the end of the War, until the Rebels are subdued, no man in the\r\nNorth thinks of it.  If the Government are equal to the People, and I\r\nbelieve they are, there will be no bargaining, there will be no\r\nnegotiation, there will be no truces with the Rebels, except to bury the\r\ndead, until every man shall have laid down his arms, disbanded his\r\norganization, submitted himself to the Government, and sued for mercy.\r\nAnd, Sir, if those who have the control of the Government are not fit\r\nfor this task and have not the nerve and mind for it, the People will\r\ntake care that there are others who are--although, Sir, I have not a bit\r\nof fear of the present Administration, or of the present Executive.\r\n\r\n\"I have spoken more freely, perhaps, than gentlemen within my hearing\r\nmight think politic, but I have spoken just what I felt.  I have spoken\r\nwhat I believe will be the result; and I warn Southern gentlemen, that\r\nif this War is to continue, there will be a time when my friend from New\r\nYork (Mr. Diven) will see it declared by this free Nation, that every\r\nbondman in the South--belonging to a Rebel, recollect; I confine it to\r\nthem--shall be called upon to aid us in War against their masters, and\r\nto restore this Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter of instruction from Secretary Cameron, touching the\r\nFugitive Slave question, dated seven days after Thaddeus Stevens'\r\nspeech, had also an interesting bearing on the subject:\r\n\r\n                         \"WASHINGTON, August 8, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: The important question of the proper disposition to be made of\r\nFugitives from Service in States in Insurrection against the Federal\r\nGovernment, to which you have again directed my attention in your letter\r\nof July 30, has received my most attentive consideration.\r\n\r\n\"It is the desire of the President that all existing rights, in all the\r\nStates, be fully respected and maintained.  The War now prosecuted on\r\nthe part of the Federal Government is a War for the Union, and for the\r\npreservation of all Constitutional rights of States, and the citizens of\r\nthe States, in the Union.  Hence, no question can arise as to Fugitives\r\nfrom Service within the States and Territories in which the authority of\r\nthe Union is fully acknowledged.  The ordinary forms of Judicial\r\nproceeding, which must be respected by Military and Civil authorities\r\nalike, will suffice for the enforcement of all legal claims.\r\n\r\n\"But in States wholly or partially under Insurrectionary control, where\r\nthe Laws of the United States are so far opposed and resisted that they\r\ncannot be effectually enforced, it is obvious that rights dependent on\r\nthe execution of those laws must, temporarily, fail; and it is equally\r\nobvious that rights dependent on the laws of the States within which\r\nMilitary operations are conducted must be necessarily subordinated to\r\nthe Military exigences created by the Insurrection, if not wholly\r\nforfeited by the Treasonable conduct of parties claiming them.  To this\r\ngeneral rule, rights to Services can form no exception.\r\n\r\n\"The Act of Congress, approved August 6, 1861, declares that if Persons\r\nheld to Service shall be employed in hostility to the United States, the\r\nright to their services shall be forfeited, and such Persons shall be\r\ndischarged therefrom.  It follows, of necessity, that no claim can be\r\nrecognized by the Military authorities of the Union to the services of\r\nsuch Persons when fugitives.\r\n\r\n\"A more difficult question is presented in respect to Persons escaping\r\nfrom the Service of Loyal masters.  It is quite apparent that the laws\r\nof the State, under which only the services of such fugitives can be\r\nclaimed, must needs be wholly, or almost wholly, suspended, as to\r\nremedies, by the Insurrection and the Military measures necessitated by\r\nit.  And it is equally apparent that the substitution of Military for\r\nJudicial measures for the enforcement of such claims must be attended by\r\ngreat inconveniences, embarrassments, and injuries.\r\n\r\n\"Under these circumstances it seems quite clear that the substantial\r\nrights of Loyal masters will be best protected by receiving such\r\nfugitives, as well as fugitives from Disloyal masters, into the service\r\nof the United States, and employing them under such organizations and in\r\nsuch occupations as circumstances may suggest or require.\r\n\r\n\"Of course a record should be kept showing the name and description of\r\nthe fugitives, the name and the character, as Loyal or Disloyal, of the\r\nmaster, and such facts as may be necessary to a correct understanding of\r\nthe circumstances of each case after tranquillity shall have been\r\nrestored.  Upon the return of Peace, Congress will, doubtless, properly\r\nprovide for all the persons thus received into the service of the Union,\r\nand for just compensation to Loyal masters.  In this way only, it would\r\nseem, can the duty and safety of the Government and the just rights of\r\nall be fully reconciled and harmonized.\r\n\r\n\"You will therefore consider yourself as instructed to govern your\r\nfuture action, in respect to Fugitives from Service, by the principles\r\nhere stated, and will report from time to time, and at least twice in\r\neach month, your action in the premises to this Department.\r\n\r\n\"You will, however, neither authorize, nor permit any interference, by\r\nthe troops under your command, with the servants of peaceful citizens in\r\nhouse or field; nor will you, in any way, encourage such servants to\r\nleave the lawful Service of their masters; nor will you, except in cases\r\nwhere the Public Safety may seem to require, prevent the voluntary\r\nreturn of any Fugitive, to the Service from which he may have escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, General, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                              \"SIMON CAMERON,\r\n                              \"Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\"Major-General B. F. BUTLER,\r\n\"Commanding Department of Virginia,\r\n\"Fortress Monroe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether or not inspired by the prophetic speech of Thaddeus Stevens,\r\naforesaid, the month of August was hardly out before its prophecy seemed\r\nin a fair way of immediate fulfilment.  Major-General John Charles\r\nFremont at that time commanded the Eastern Department--comprising the\r\nStates of Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, and Kentucky-and he startled the\r\nCountry by issuing the following Emancipation proclamation:\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"HEADQUARTERS OF THE WESTERN DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n                    \"St. Louis, August 30, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"Circumstances, in my judgment, of sufficient urgency, render it\r\nnecessary that the commanding general of this Department should assume\r\nthe administrative powers of the State.  Its disorganized condition, the\r\nhelplessness of the civil authority, the total insecurity of life, and\r\nthe devastation of property by bands of murderers and marauders, who\r\ninfest nearly every county of the State, and avail themselves of the\r\npublic misfortunes and the vicinity of a hostile force to gratify\r\nprivate and neighborhood vengeance, and who find an enemy wherever they\r\nfind plunder, finally demand the severest measures to repress the daily\r\nincreasing crimes and outrages which are driving off the inhabitants and\r\nruining the State.\r\n\r\n\"In this condition, the public safety and the success of our arms\r\nrequire unity of purpose, without let or hinderance, to the prompt\r\nadministration of affairs.\r\n\r\n\"In order, therefore, to suppress disorder, to maintain as far as now\r\npracticable the public peace, and to give security and protection to the\r\npersons and property of loyal citizens, I do hereby extend and declare\r\nestablished Martial Law throughout the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\n\"The lines of the Army of Occupation in this State are for the present\r\ndeclared to extend from Leavenworth by way of the posts of Jefferson\r\nCity, Rolla, and Ironton, to Cape Girardeau, on the Mississippi river.\r\n\r\n\"All persons who shall betaken with arms in their hands within these\r\nlines shall be tried by Court-Martial, and if found guilty will be shot.\r\n\r\n\"The property, real and personal, of all persons, in the State of\r\nMissouri, who shall take up arms against the United States, or who shall\r\nbe directly proven to have taken an active part with their Enemies in\r\nthe field, is declared to be confiscated to the public use, and their\r\nSlaves, if any they have, are hereby declared Free men.\r\n\r\n\"All persons who shall be proven to have destroyed, after the\r\npublication of this order, railroad tracks, bridges, or telegraphs,\r\nshall suffer the extreme penalty of the law.\r\n\r\n\"All persons engaged in Treasonable correspondence, in giving or\r\nprocuring aid to the Enemies of the United States, in fomenting tumults,\r\nin disturbing the public tranquillity by creating and circulating false\r\nreports or incendiary documents, are in their own interests warned that\r\nthey are exposing themselves to sudden and severe punishment.\r\n\r\n\"All persons who have been led away from their allegiance, are required\r\nto return to their homes forthwith; any such absence, without sufficient\r\ncause, will be held to be presumptive evidence against them.\r\n\r\n\"The object of this declaration is to place in the hands of the Military\r\nauthorities the power to give instantaneous effect to existing laws, and\r\nto supply such deficiencies as the conditions of War demand.  But this\r\nis not intended to suspend the ordinary Tribunals of the Country, where\r\nthe Law will be administered by the Civil officers in the usual manner,\r\nand with their customary authority, while the same can be peaceably\r\nexercised.\r\n\r\n\"The commanding general will labor vigilantly for the public Welfare,\r\nand in his efforts for their safety hopes to obtain not only the\r\nacquiescence, but the active support of the Loyal People of the Country.\r\n\r\n                              \"J. C. FREMONT,\r\n                         \"Major-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFremont's Proclamation of Confiscation and Emancipation, was hailed with\r\njoy by some Patriots in the North, but was by others looked upon as rash\r\nand premature and inexpedient; while it bitterly stirred the anger of\r\nthe Rebels everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel Jeff. Thompson, then in command of the Rebel forces about St.\r\nLouis, at once issued the following savage proclamation of retaliation:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"HEADQUARTERS FIRST MILITARY DISTRICT, M. S. G.\r\n\r\n               'St. Louis, August 31, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"To all whom it may concern:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas Major-General John C.  Fremont, commanding the minions of\r\nAbraham Lincoln in the State of Missouri, has seen fit to declare\r\nMartial Law throughout the whole State, and has threatened to shoot any\r\ncitizen-soldier found in arms within certain limits; also, to Confiscate\r\nthe property and Free the Negroes belonging to the members of the\r\nMissouri State Guard:\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, know ye, that I, M. Jeff.  Thompson, Brigadier-General of\r\nthe First Military District of Missouri, having not only the Military\r\nauthority of Brigadier-General, but certain police powers granted by\r\nActing-Governor Thomas C. Reynolds, and confirmed afterward by Governor\r\nJackson, do most solemnly promise that for every member of the Missouri\r\nState Guard, or soldier of our allies, the Armies of the Confederate\r\nStates, who shall be put to death in pursuance of the said order of\r\nGeneral Fremont, I will hang, draw, and quarter a minion of said Abraham\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\n\"While I am anxious that this unfortunate War shall be conducted, if\r\npossible, upon the most liberal principles of civilized warfare--and\r\nevery order that I have issued has been with that object--yet, if this\r\nrule is to be adopted (and it must first be done by our Enemies) I\r\nintend to exceed General Fremont in his excesses, and will make all\r\ntories that come within my reach rue the day that a different policy was\r\nadopted by their leaders.\r\n\r\n\"Already mills, barns, warehouses, and other private property have been\r\nwastefully and wantonly destroyed by the Enemy in this district, while\r\nwe have taken nothing except articles strictly contraband or absolutely\r\nnecessary.

THOMPSON,\r\n                    \"Brigadier-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"President Lincoln, greatly embarrassed by the precipitate action of his\r\nsubordinate, lost no time in suggesting to General Fremont certain\r\nmodifications of his Emancipation proclamation-as follows:\r\n\r\n\"[PRIVATE.]\r\n               \"WASHINGTON, D.  C., September 2, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR: Two points in your proclamation of August 30th give me\r\nsome anxiety:\r\n\r\n\"First.  Should you shoot a man according to the proclamation, the\r\nConfederates would very certainly shoot our best man in their hands, in\r\nretaliation; and so, man for man, indefinitely.  It is, therefore, my\r\norder that you allow no man to be shot under the proclamation without\r\nfirst having my approbation or consent.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  I think there is great danger that the closing paragraph, in\r\nrelation to the Confiscation of Property, and the liberating Slaves of\r\nTraitorous owners, will alarm our Southern Union friends, and turn them\r\nagainst us; perhaps ruin our rather fair prospect for Kentucky.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me, therefore, to ask that you will, as of your own motion,\r\nmodify that paragraph so as to conform to the first and fourth sections\r\nof the Act of Congress entitled, 'An Act to Confiscate Property used for\r\nInsurrectionary purposes,' approved August 6, 1861, a copy of which Act\r\nI herewith send you.\r\n\r\n\"This letter is written in a spirit of caution, and not of censure.\r\n\r\n\"I send it by a special messenger, in that it may certainly and speedily\r\nreach you.\r\n                              \"Yours very truly,\r\n                              \"A. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\"Major-General FREMONT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Fremont replied to President Lincoln's suggestions, as follows:\r\n\r\n                    \"HEADQUARTERS WESTERN DEPARTMENT,\r\n                    \"St.  Louis, September 8, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR: Your letter of the second, by special\r\nmessenger, I know to have been written before you had received my\r\nletter, and before my telegraphic dispatches and the rapid developments\r\nof critical conditions here had informed you of affairs in this quarter.\r\nI had not written to you fully and frequently, first, because in the\r\nincessant change of affairs I would be exposed to give you contradictory\r\naccounts; and secondly, because the amount of the subjects to be laid\r\nbefore you would demand too much of your time.\r\n\r\n\"Trusting to have your confidence, I have been leaving it to events\r\nthemselves to show you whether or not I was shaping affairs here\r\naccording to your ideas.  The shortest communication between Washington\r\nand St. Louis generally involves two days, and the employment of two\r\ndays, in time of War, goes largely toward success or disaster.  I\r\ntherefore went along according to my own judgment, leaving the result of\r\nmy movement to justify me with you.\r\n\r\n\"And so in regard to my proclamation of the thirtieth.  Between the\r\nRebel Armies, the Provisional Government, and the home Traitors, I felt\r\nthe position bad, and saw danger.  In the night I decided upon the\r\nproclamation and the form of it--I wrote it the next morning and printed\r\nit the same day.  I did it without consultation or advice with any one,\r\nacting solely with my best judgment to serve the Country and yourself,\r\nand perfectly willing to receive the amount of censure which should be\r\nthought due, if I had made a false movement.\r\n\r\n\"This is as much a movement in the War, as a battle, and, in going into\r\nthese, I shall have to act according to my judgment of the ground before\r\nme, as I did on this occasion.  If upon reflection, your better judgment\r\nstill decides that I am wrong in the article respecting the Liberation\r\nof Slaves, I have to ask that you will openly direct me to make the\r\ncorrection.  The implied censure will be received as a soldier always\r\nshould the reprimand of his chief.\r\n\r\n\"If I were to retract of my own accord, it would imply that I myself\r\nthought it wrong, and that I had acted without the reflection which the\r\ngravity of the point demanded.  But I did not.  I acted with full\r\ndeliberation, and upon the certain conviction that it was a measure\r\nright and necessary, and I think so still.\r\n\r\n\"In regard to the other point of the proclamation to which you refer, I\r\ndesire to say that I do not think the Enemy can either misconstrue or\r\nurge anything against it, or undertake to make unusual retaliation.  The\r\nshooting of men who shall rise in arms against an Army in the Military\r\noccupation of a Country, is merely a necessary measure of defense, and\r\nentirely according to the usages of civilized warfare.  The article does\r\nnot at all refer to prisoners of war, and certainly our Enemies have no\r\ngrounds for requiring that we should waive in their benefit any of the\r\nordinary advantages which the usages of War allow to us.\r\n\r\n\"As promptitude is itself an advantage in War, I have also to ask that\r\nyou will permit me to carry out upon the spot the provisions of the\r\nproclamation in this respect.\r\n\r\n\"Looking at affairs from this point of view, I am satisfied that strong\r\nand vigorous measures have now become necessary to the success of our\r\nArms; and hoping that my views may have the honor to meet your approval,\r\n\r\n     \"I am, with respect and regard, very truly yours,\r\n                         \"J. C. FREMONT.\r\n\r\n\"THE PRESIDENT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln subsequently rejoined, ordering a modification of the\r\nproclamation.  His letter ran thus:\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON, September 11, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"SIR: Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2d instant, is just\r\nreceived.  Assuming that you, upon the ground, could better judge of the\r\nnecessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing\r\nyour Proclamation of August 30th, I perceived no general objection to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"The particular clause, however, in relation to the Confiscation of\r\nProperty and the Liberation of Slaves, appeared to me to be\r\nobjectionable in its non-conformity to the Act of Congress, passed the\r\n6th of last August, upon the same subjects; and hence I wrote you\r\nexpressing my wish that that clause should be modified accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"Your answer, just received, expresses the preference, on your part,\r\nthat I should make an open order for the modification, which I very\r\ncheerfully do.\r\n\r\n\"It is therefore Ordered, that the said clause of said proclamation be\r\nso modified, held, and construed as to conform to, and not to transcend,\r\nthe provisions on the same subject contained in the Act of Congress\r\nentitled, 'An Act to Confiscate Property used for Insurrectionary\r\nPurposes,' approved August 6, 1861, and that said Act be published at\r\nlength with this Order.\r\n\r\n                         \"Your obedient servant,\r\n                                   \"A.

The dictates of a duty which, under these circumstances, I owe\r\nto a great sovereign State, and to a proud and hospitable people, among\r\nwhom I have passed some of the pleasantest days of my life, prompt me to\r\nproclaim that we have come amongst you with no feelings of personal\r\nanimosity, no desire to harm your citizens, destroy your property, or\r\ninterfere with any of your lawful rights or your social or local\r\nInstitutions, beyond what the causes herein alluded to may render\r\nunavoidable.\"\r\n\r\nMajor-General Wool, at Fortress Monroe, where he had succeeded General\r\nButler, likewise issued a Special Order on the subject of Contrabands,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,\r\n\"FORT MONROE, October 14, 1861.\r\n\"[Special Orders No. 72.]\r\n\r\n\"All Colored Persons called Contrabands, employed as servants by\r\nofficers and others residing within Fort Monroe, or outside of the Fort\r\nat Camp Hamilton and Camp Butler, will be furnished with their\r\nsubsistence and at least eight dollars per month for males, and four\r\ndollars per month for females, by the officers or others thus employing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"So much of the above-named sums, as may be necessary to furnish\r\nclothing, to be decided by the Chief Quartermaster of the Department,\r\nwill be applied to that purpose, and the remainder will be paid into his\r\nhands to create a fund for the support of those Contrabands who are\r\nunable to work for their own support.\r\n\r\n\"All able-bodied Colored Persons who are under the protection of the\r\ntroops of this Department, and who are not employed as servants, will be\r\nimmediately put to work in either the Engineer's or Quartermaster's\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\"By command of Major-General Wool:\r\n\r\n\"[Signed]  WILLIAM D.

The remainder of the money valuation\r\nof their Labor, will be turned over to the Quartermaster, who will\r\ndeduct from it the cost of the clothing issued to them; the balance will\r\nconstitute a fund to be expended by the Quartermaster under the\r\ndirection of the Commanding officer of the Department of Virginia for\r\nthe support of the women and children and those that are unable to work.\r\n\r\n\"For any unusual amount of Labor performed, they may receive extra pay,\r\nvarying in amount from fifty cents to one dollar, this to be paid by the\r\ndepartments employing them, to the men themselves, and to be for their\r\nown use.\r\n\r\n\"Should any man be prevented from working, on account of sickness, for\r\nsix consecutive days, or ten days in any one month, one-half of the\r\nmoney value will be paid.

It has been represented that important information respecting the\r\nnumber and condition of our Forces, is conveyed to the Enemy by means of\r\nFugitive Slaves who are admitted within our lines.  In order to remedy\r\nthis evil, it is directed that no such Persons be hereafter permitted to\r\nenter the lines of any camp, or of any forces on the march; and that any\r\nnow within such lines be immediately excluded therefrom.\"\r\n\r\nThis Order was subsequently explained in a letter, of December 8, 1861,\r\nfrom General Halleck to Hon. F. P.  Blair, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\" * * * Order No. 3 was in my mind, clearly a Military necessity.\r\nUnauthorized persons, black or white, Free or Slaves, must be kept out\r\nof our camps, unless we are willing to publish to the Enemy everything\r\nwe do or intend to do.  It was a Military and not a political order.  I\r\nam ready to carry out any lawful instructions in regard to Fugitive\r\nSlaves which my superiors may give me, and to enforce any law which\r\nCongress may pass.  But I cannot make law, and will not violate it.  You\r\nknow my private opinion on the policy of Confiscating the Slave Property\r\nof Rebels in Arms.  If Congress shall pass it, you may be certain that I\r\nshall enforce it.  Perhaps my policy as to the treatment of Rebels and\r\ntheir property is as well set out in Order No. 13, issued the day\r\n(December 4, 1861), your letter was written, as I could now describe\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be well also to add here, as belonging to this period of\r\ndoubtfulness touching the status of escaped Slaves, the following\r\ncommunication sent by Secretary Seward to General McClellan, touching\r\n\"Contrabands\" in the District of Columbia:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DEPARTMENT OF STATE,\r\n\"WASHINGTON, December 4, 1861.\r\n\r\n\"To Major-General GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, Washington:\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: I am directed by the President to call your attention to the\r\nfollowing subject:\r\n\r\n\"Persons claimed to be held to Service or Labor under the laws of the\r\nState of Virginia, and actually employed in hostile service against the\r\nGovernment of the United States, frequently escape from the lines of the\r\nEnemy's Forces and are received within the lines of the Army of the\r\nPotomac.\r\n\r\n\"This Department understands that such Persons afterward coming into the\r\ncity of Washington are liable to be arrested by the city police, upon\r\nthe presumption, arising from color, that they are Fugitives from\r\nService or Labor.\r\n\r\n\"By the 4th section of the Act of Congress approved August 6, 1861,\r\nentitled, 'An Act to Confiscate Property used for Insurrectionary\r\npurposes,' such hostile employment is made a full and sufficient answer\r\nto any further claim to Service or Labor.  Persons thus employed and\r\nescaping are received into the Military protection of the United States,\r\nand their arrest as Fugitives from Service or Labor should be\r\nimmediately followed by the Military arrest of the parties making the\r\nseizure.\r\n\r\n\"Copies of this communication will be sent to the Mayor of the city of\r\nWashington and to the Marshal of the District of Columbia, that any\r\ncollision between the Civil and Military authorities may be avoided.\r\n\r\n\"I am, General, your very obedient,\r\n\r\n                              \"WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n                  \"COMPENSATED GRADUAL EMANCIPATION.\"\r\n\r\nThus far the reader's eye has been able to review in their successive\r\norder some of the many difficulties and perplexities which beset the\r\npathway of President Lincoln as he felt his way in the dark, as it were,\r\ntoward Emancipation.  It must seem pretty evident now, however, that his\r\nchief concern was for the preservation of the Union, even though all\r\nother things--Emancipation with them--had to be temporarily sacrificed.\r\n\r\nSomething definite, however, had been already gained.  Congress had\r\nasserted its right under the War powers of the Constitution, to release\r\nfrom all claim to Service or Labor those Slaves whose Service or Labor\r\nhad been used in hostility to the Union.  And while some of the Union\r\nGenerals obstructed the execution of the Act enforcing that right, by\r\nrepelling and even as we have seen, expelling, from the Union lines all\r\nFugitive Slaves--whether such as had or had not been used in hostility\r\nto us--yet still the cause of Freedom to all, was slowly and silently\r\nperhaps, yet surely and irresistibly, marching on until the time when,\r\nbecoming a chief factor in the determination of the question of \"whether\r\nwe should have a Country at all,\" it should triumph coincidently with\r\nthe preservation of the Republic.\r\n\r\nBut now a new phase of the Slave question arose--a question not\r\ninvolving what to do with Fugitive Slaves of any sort, whether engaged\r\nor not engaged in performing services hostile to the Union cause, but\r\nwhat to do with Slaves whom their panic-stricken owners had, for the\r\ntime being, abandoned in the presence of our Armies.\r\n\r\nThis question was well discussed in the original draft of the report of\r\nthe Secretary of War, December 1, 1861 in which Secretary Cameron said:\r\n\r\n\"It has become a grave question for determination what shall be done\r\nwith the Slaves abandoned by their owners on the advance of our troops\r\ninto Southern territory, as in the Beaufort district of South Carolina.\r\nThe whole White population therein is six thousand, while the number of\r\nNegroes exceeds thirty-two thousand.  The panic which drove their\r\nmasters in wild confusion from their homes, leaves them in undisputed\r\npossession of the soil.  Shall they, armed by their masters, be placed\r\nin the field to fight against us, or shall their labor be continually\r\nemployed in reproducing the means for supporting the Armies of\r\nRebellion?\r\n\r\n\"The War into which this Government has been forced by rebellious\r\nTraitors is carried on for the purpose of repossessing the property\r\nviolently and treacherously seized upon by the Enemies of the\r\nGovernment, and to re-establish the authority and Laws of the United\r\nStates in the places where it is opposed or overthrown by armed\r\nInsurrection and Rebellion.  Its purpose is to recover and defend what\r\nis justly its own.\r\n\r\n\"War, even between Independent Nations, is made to subdue the Enemy, and\r\nall that belongs to that Enemy, by occupying the hostile country, and\r\nexercising dominion over all the men and things within its territory.\r\nThis being true in respect to Independent Nations at war with each\r\nother, it follows that Rebels who are laboring by force of arms to\r\noverthrow a Government, justly bring upon themselves all the\r\nconsequences of War, and provoke the destruction merited by the worst of\r\ncrimes.  That Government would be false to National trust, and would\r\njustly excite the ridicule of the civilized World, that would abstain\r\nfrom the use of any efficient means to preserve its own existence, or to\r\novercome a rebellious and traitorous Enemy, by sparing or protecting the\r\nproperty of those who are waging War against it.\r\n\r\n\"The principal wealth and power of the Rebel States is a peculiar\r\nspecies of Property, consisting of the service or labor of African\r\nSlaves, or the descendants of Africans.  This Property has been\r\nvariously estimated at the value of from seven hundred million to one\r\nthousand million dollars.\r\n\r\n\"Why should this Property be exempt from the hazards and consequences of\r\na rebellious War?\r\n\r\n\"It was the boast of the leader of the Rebellion, while he yet had a\r\nseat in the Senate of the United States, that the Southern States would\r\nbe comparatively safe and free from the burdens of War, if it should be\r\nbrought on by the contemplated Rebellion, and that boast was accompanied\r\nby the savage threat that 'Northern towns and cities would become the\r\nvictims of rapine and Military spoil,' and that 'Northern men should\r\nsmell Southern gunpowder and feel Southern steel.'\r\n\r\n\"No one doubts the disposition of the Rebels to carry that threat into\r\nexecution.  The wealth of Northern towns and cities, the produce of\r\nNorthern farms, Northern workshops and manufactories would certainly be\r\nseized, destroyed, or appropriated as Military spoil.  No property in\r\nthe North would be spared from the hands of the Rebels, and their rapine\r\nwould be defended under the laws of War.  While the Loyal States thus\r\nhave all their property and possessions at stake, are the insurgent\r\nRebels to carry on warfare against the Government in peace and security\r\nto their own property?\r\n\r\n\"Reason and justice and self-preservation forbid that such should be;\r\nthe policy of this Government, but demand, on the contrary, that, being\r\nforced by Traitors and Rebels to the extremity of war, all the rights\r\nand powers of war should be exercised to bring it to a speedy end.\r\n\r\n\"Those who war against the Government justly forfeit all rights of\r\nproperty, privilege, or security, derived from the Constitution and\r\nLaws, against which they are in armed Rebellion; and as the labor and\r\nservice of their Slaves constitute the chief Property of the Rebels,\r\nsuch Property should share the common fate of War to which they have\r\ndevoted the property of Loyal citizens.\r\n\r\n\"While it is plain that the Slave Property of the South is justly\r\nsubjected to all the consequences of this Rebellious War, and that the\r\nGovernment would be untrue to its trust in not employing all the rights\r\nand powers of War to bring it to a speedy close, the details of the plan\r\nfor doing so, like all other Military measures, must, in a great degree,\r\nbe left to be determined by particular exigencies.  The disposition of\r\nother property belonging to the Rebels that becomes subject to our arms\r\nis governed by the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n\"The Government has no power to hold Slaves, none to restrain a Slave of\r\nhis Liberty, or to exact his service.  It has a right, however, to use\r\nthe voluntary service of Slaves liberated by War from their Rebel\r\nmasters, like any other property of the Rebels, in whatever mode may be\r\nmost efficient for the defense of the Government, the prosecution of the\r\nWar, and the suppression of Rebellion.  It is clearly a right of the\r\nGovernment to arm Slaves when it may become necessary, as it is to take\r\ngunpowder from the Enemy; whether it is expedient to do so, is purely a\r\nMilitary question.  The right is unquestionable by the laws of War.  The\r\nexpediency must be determined by circumstances, keeping in view the\r\ngreat object of overcoming the Rebels, reestablishing the Laws, and\r\nrestoring Peace to the Nation.\r\n\r\n\"It is vain and idle for the Government to carry on this War, or hope to\r\nmaintain its existence against rebellious force, without employing all\r\nthe rights and powers of War.  As has been said, the right to deprive\r\nthe Rebels of their Property in Slaves and Slave Labor is as clear and\r\nabsolute as the right to take forage from the field, or cotton from the\r\nwarehouse, or powder and arms from the magazine.  To leave the Enemy in\r\nthe possession of such property as forage and cotton and military\r\nstores, and the means of constantly reproducing them, would be madness.\r\nIt is, therefore, equal madness to leave them in peaceful and secure\r\npossession of Slave Property, more valuable and efficient to them for\r\nwar than forage, cotton, military stores.  Such policy would be National\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n\"What to do with that species of Property is a question that time and\r\ncircumstances will solve, and need not be anticipated further than to\r\nrepeat that they cannot be held by the Government as Slaves.  It would\r\nbe useless to keep them as prisoners of War; and self-preservation, the\r\nhighest duty of a Government, or of individuals, demands that they\r\nshould be disposed of or employed in the most effective manner that will\r\ntend most speedily to suppress the Insurrection and restore the\r\nauthority of the Government.  If it shall be found that the men who have\r\nbeen held by the Rebels as Slaves, are capable of bearing arms and\r\nperforming efficient Military service, it is the right, and may become\r\nthe duty, of this Government to arm and equip them, and employ their\r\nservices against the Rebels, under proper Military regulations,\r\ndiscipline, and command.\r\n\r\n\"But in whatever manner they may be used by the Government, it is plain\r\nthat, once liberated by the rebellious act of their masters they should\r\nnever again be restored to bondage.  By the master's Treason and\r\nRebellion he forfeits all right to the labor and service of his Slave;\r\nand the Slave of the rebellious master, by his service to the\r\nGovernment, becomes justly entitled to Freedom and protection.\r\n\r\n\"The disposition to be made of the Slaves of Rebels, after the close of\r\nthe War, can be safely left to the wisdom and patriotism of Congress.\r\nThe Representatives of the People will unquestionably secure to the\r\nLoyal Slaveholders every right to which they are entitled under the\r\nConstitution of the Country.\"\r\n\r\nThis original draft of the report was modified, at the instance of\r\nPresident Lincoln, to the following--and thus appeared in Secretary\r\nCameron's report of that date, as printed:\r\n\r\n\"It is already a grave question what shall be done with those Slaves who\r\nwere abandoned by their owners on the advance of our troops into\r\nSouthern territory, as at Beaufort district, in South Carolina.  The\r\nnumber left within our control at that point is very considerable, and\r\nsimilar cases will probably occur.  What should be done with them?  Can\r\nwe afford to send them forward to their masters, to be by them armed\r\nagainst us, or used in producing supplies to sustain the Rebellion?\r\n\r\n\"Their labor may be useful to us; withheld from the Enemy it lessens his\r\nMilitary resources, and withholding them has no tendency to induce the\r\nhorrors of Insurrection, even in the Rebel communities.  They constitute\r\na Military resource, and, being such, that they should not be turned\r\nover to the Enemy is too plain to discuss.  Why deprive him of supplies\r\nby a blockade, and voluntarily give him men to produce them?\r\n\r\n\"The disposition to be made of the Slaves of Rebels, after the close of\r\nthe War, can be safely left to the wisdom and patriotism of Congress.\r\nThe Representatives of the People will unquestionably secure to the\r\nLoyal Slaveholders every right to which they are entitled under the\r\nConstitution of the Country.\r\n\r\nSIMON CAMERON.\r\n\"Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe language of this modification is given to show that the President,\r\nat the close of the year 1861, had already reached a further step\r\nforward toward Emancipation--and the sound reasoning upon which he made\r\nthat advance.  He was satisfying his own mind and conscience as he\r\nproceeded, and thus, while justifying himself to himself, was also\r\nsimultaneously carrying conviction to the minds and consciences of the\r\nPeople, whose servant and agent he was.\r\n\r\nThat these abandoned Slaves would \"constitute a Military resource\" and\r\n\"should not be turned over to the Enemy\" and that \"their labor may be\r\nuseful to us\" were propositions which could not be gainsaid.  But to\r\nquiet uncalled-for apprehensions, and to encourage Southern loyalty, he\r\nadded, in substance, that at the close of this War--waged solely for the\r\npreservation of the Union--Congress would decide the doubtful status of\r\nthe Slaves of Rebels, while the rights of Union Slave-holders would be\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nThe Contraband-Slave question, however, continued to agitate the public\r\nmind for many months--owing to the various ways in which it was treated\r\nby the various Military commanders, to whose discretion its treatment,\r\nin their several commands, was left--a discretion which almost\r\ninvariably leaned toward the political bias of the commander.  Thus, in\r\na proclamation, dated St. Louis, February 23, 1862, Halleck, commanding\r\nthe Department of Missouri, said:\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers! let no excess on your part tarnish the glory of our arms!\r\n\r\n\"The order heretofore issued in this department, in regard to pillaging\r\nand marauding, the destruction of private property, and the stealing or\r\nconcealment of Slaves, must be strictly enforced.  It does not belong to\r\nthe Military to decide upon the relation of Master and Slave.  Such\r\nquestions must be settled by the civil Courts.  No Fugitive Slaves will\r\ntherefore be admitted within our lines or camps, except when especially\r\nordered by the General Commanding.  * * * \"\r\n\r\nAnd Buell, commanding the Department of the Ohio, in response to a\r\ncommunication on the subject from the Chairman of the Military Committee\r\nof the Kentucky Legislature, wrote, March 6, 1862:\r\n\r\n\"It has come to my knowledge that Slaves sometimes make their way\r\nimproperly into our lines, and in some instances they may be enticed\r\nthere, but I think the number has been magnified by report.  Several\r\napplications have been made to me by persons whose servants have been\r\nfound in our camps, and in every instance that I know of the master has\r\nrecovered his servant and taken him away.\"\r\n\r\nThus, while some of our Commanders, like Dix and Halleck, repelled or\r\neven expelled the Fugitive Slave from their lines; and others, like\r\nBuell and Hooker, facilitated the search for, and restoration to his\r\nmaster, of the black Fugitive found within our lines; on the other hand,\r\nFremont, as we have seen, and Doubleday and Hunter, as we shall yet see,\r\ntook totally different ground on this question.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, however, harassed as he was by the extremists on both\r\nsides of the Slavery question, still maintained that calm statesman-like\r\nmiddle-course from which the best results were likely to flow.  But he\r\nnow thought the time had come to broach the question of a compensated,\r\ngradual Emancipation.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on March 6, 1862, he sent to Congress the following\r\nmessage:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\n\"I recommend the adoption of a joint Resolution by your honorable\r\nbodies, which shall be substantially as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State\r\nwhich may adopt gradual abolishment of Slavery, giving to such State\r\npecuniary aid, to be used by such State in its discretion, to compensate\r\nfor the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such change of\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\"If the proposition contained in the Resolution does not meet the\r\napproval of Congress and the Country, there is the end; but if it does\r\ncommand such approval, I deem it of importance that the States and\r\npeople immediately interested should be at once distinctly notified of\r\nthe fact, so that they may begin to consider whether to accept or reject\r\nit, The Federal Government would find its highest interest in such a\r\nmeasure, as one of the most efficient means of self preservation.\r\n\r\n\"The leaders of the existing Insurrection entertain the hope that this\r\nGovernment will ultimately be forced to acknowledge the Independence of\r\nsome part of the disaffected region, and that all the Slave States North\r\nof such part will then say, 'the Union for which we have struggled being\r\nalready gone, we now choose to go with the Southern Section.'\r\n\r\n\"To deprive them of this hope, substantially ends the Rebellion; and the\r\ninitiation of Emancipation completely deprives them of it, as to all the\r\nStates initiating it.  The point is not that all the States tolerating\r\nSlavery would very soon, if at all, initiate Emancipation; but that,\r\nwhile the offer is equally made to all, the more Northern shall, by such\r\ninitiation, make it certain to the more Southern that in no event will\r\nthe former ever join the latter in their proposed Confederacy.  I say,\r\n'initiation,' because in my judgment, gradual, and not sudden\r\nEmancipation, is better for all.\r\n\r\n\"In the mere financial or pecuniary view, any member of Congress, with\r\nthe census tables and Treasury reports before him, can readily see for\r\nhimself how very soon the current expenditures of this War would\r\npurchase, at fair valuation, all the Slaves in any named State.\r\n\r\n\"Such a proposition on the part of the General Government sets up no\r\nclaim of a right by Federal authority to interfere with Slavery within\r\nState limits, referring, as it does, the absolute control of the subject\r\nin each case to the State and its people immediately interested.  It is\r\nproposed as a matter of perfectly free choice with them.\r\n\r\n\"In the Annual Message last December, I thought fit to say, 'the Union\r\nmust be preserved; and hence all indispensable means must be employed.'\r\nI said this, not hastily, but deliberately.  War has been made, and\r\ncontinues to be an indispensable means to this end.  A practical\r\nreacknowledgment of the National authority would render the War\r\nunnecessary, and it would at once cease.  If, however, resistance\r\ncontinues, the War must also continue; and it is impossible to foresee\r\nall the incidents which may attend, and all the ruin which may follow\r\nit.  Such as may seem indispensable, or may obviously promise great\r\nefficiency toward ending the struggle, must and will come.\r\n\r\n\"The proposition now made, though an offer only, I hope it may be\r\nesteemed no offense to ask whether the pecuniary consideration tendered\r\nwould not be of more value to the States and private persons concerned,\r\nthan are the Institution, and Property in it, in the present aspect of\r\naffairs?\r\n\r\n\"While it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would be\r\nmerely initiatory, and not within itself a practical measure, it is\r\nrecommended in the hope that it would soon lead to important practical\r\nresults.  In full view of my great responsibility to my God and to my\r\nCountry, I earnestly beg the attention of Congress and the People to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"March 6, 1862.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the above suggestion from the President, a Joint\r\nResolution, in the precise words suggested, was introduced into the\r\nHouse, March 10, by Roscoe Conkling, and on the following day was\r\nadopted in the House by 97 yeas to 36 nays.\r\n\r\nOf the 36 members of the House who voted against this Resolution, were\r\n34 Democrats, and among them were Messrs. Crisfield of Maryland, and\r\nMessrs. Crittenden, Mallory, and Menzies of Kentucky.  These gentleman\r\nafterward made public a report, drawn by themselves, of an interesting\r\ninterview they had held with President Lincoln on this important\r\nsubject, in the words following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MEMORANDUM OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND SOME BORDER\r\nSLAVE-STATE REPRESENTATIVES MARCH 10, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"'DEAR SIR:--I called, at the request of the President, to ask you to\r\ncome to the White House to-morrow morning, at nine o'clock, and bring\r\nsuch of your colleagues as are in town.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"'WASHINGTON, March 10, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday on my return from church I found Mr. Postmaster General Blair\r\nin my room, writing the above note, which he immediately suspended, and\r\nverbally communicated the President's invitation; and stated that the\r\nPresident's purpose was to have some conversation with the delegations\r\nof Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware, in explanation\r\nof his Message of the 6th inst.\r\n\r\n\"This morning these delegations, or such of them as were in town,\r\nassembled at the White House at the appointed time, and after some\r\nlittle delay were admitted to an audience.\r\n\r\n\"After the usual salutations and we were seated, the President said, in\r\nsubstance, that he had invited us to meet him to have some conversation\r\nwith us in explanation of his Message of the 6th; that since he had sent\r\nit in, several of the gentlemen then present had visited him, but had\r\navoided any allusion to the Message, and he therefore inferred that the\r\nimport of the Message had been misunderstood, and was regarded as\r\ninimical to the interests we represented; and he had resolved he would\r\ntalk with us, and disabuse our minds of that erroneous opinion.\r\n\r\n\"The President then disclaimed any intent to injure the interests or\r\nwound the sensibilities of the Slave States.  On the contrary, his\r\npurpose was to protect the one and respect the other; that we were\r\nengaged in a terrible, wasting, and tedious War; immense Armies were in\r\nthe field, and must continue in the field as long as the War lasts; that\r\nthese Armies must, of necessity, be brought into contact with Slaves in\r\nthe States we represented and in other States as they advanced; that\r\nSlaves would come to the camps, and continual irritation was kept up;\r\nthat he was constantly annoyed by conflicting and antagonistic\r\ncomplaints; on the one side, a certain class complained if the Slave was\r\nnot protected by the Army; persons were frequently found who,\r\nparticipating in these views, acted in a way unfriendly to the\r\nSlaveholder; on the other hand, Slaveholders complained that their\r\nrights were interfered with, their Slaves induced to abscond, and\r\nprotected within the lines, these complaints were numerous, loud, and\r\ndeep; were a serious annoyance to him and embarrassing to the progress\r\nof the War; that it kept alive a spirit hostile to the Government in the\r\nStates we represented; strengthened the hopes of the Confederates that\r\nat some day the Border States would unite with them, and thus tend to\r\nprolong the War; and he was of opinion, if this Resolution should be\r\nadopted by Congress and accepted by our States, these causes of\r\nirritation and these hopes would be removed, and more would be\r\naccomplished towards shortening the War than could be hoped from the\r\ngreatest victory achieved by Union Armies; that he made this proposition\r\nin good faith, and desired it to be accepted, if at all, voluntarily,\r\nand in the same patriotic spirit in which it was made; that Emancipation\r\nwas a subject exclusively under the control of the States, and must be\r\nadopted or rejected by each for itself; that he did not claim nor had\r\nthis Government any right to coerce them for that purpose; that such was\r\nno part of his purpose in making this proposition, and he wished it to\r\nbe clearly understood; that he did not expect us there to be prepared to\r\ngive him an answer, but he hoped we would take the subject into serious\r\nconsideration; confer with one another, and then take such course as we\r\nfelt our duty and the interests of our constituents required of us.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Noell, of Missouri, said that in his State, Slavery was not\r\nconsidered a permanent Institution; that natural causes were there in\r\noperation which would, at no distant day, extinguish it, and he did not\r\nthink that this proposition was necessary for that; and, besides that,\r\nhe and his friends felt solicitous as to the Message on account of the\r\ndifferent constructions which the Resolution and Message had received.\r\nThe New York Tribune was for it, and understood it to mean that we must\r\naccept gradual Emancipation according to the plan suggested, or get\r\nsomething worse.\r\n\r\n\"The President replied, he must not be expected to quarrel with the New\r\nYork Tribune before the right time; he hoped never to have to do it; he\r\nwould not anticipate events.  In respect to Emancipation in Missouri, he\r\nsaid that what had been observed by Mr. Noell was probably true, but the\r\noperation of these natural causes had not prevented the irritating\r\nconduct to which he had referred, or destroyed the hopes of the\r\nConfederates that Missouri would at some time range herself alongside of\r\nthem, which, in his judgment, the passage of this Resolution by\r\nCongress, and its acceptance by Missouri, would accomplish.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Crisfield, of Maryland, asked what would be the effect of the\r\nrefusal of the State to accept this proposal, and desired to know if the\r\nPresident looked to any policy beyond the acceptance or rejection of\r\nthis scheme.\r\n\r\n\"The President replied that he had no designs beyond the action of the\r\nStates on this particular subject.  He should lament their refusal to\r\naccept it, but he had no designs beyond their refusal of it.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Menzies, of Kentucky, inquired if the President thought there was\r\nany power, except in the States themselves, to carry out his scheme of\r\nEmancipation?\r\n\r\n\"The President replied, he thought there could not be.  He then went off\r\ninto a course of remark not qualifying the foregoing declaration, nor\r\nmaterial to be repeated to a just understanding of his meaning.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Crisfield said he did not think the people of Maryland looked upon\r\nSlavery as a permanent Institution; and he did not know that they would\r\nbe very reluctant to give it up if provision was made to meet the loss,\r\nand they could be rid of the race; but they did not like to be coerced\r\ninto Emancipation, either by the direct action of the Government or by\r\nindirection, as through the Emancipation of Slaves in this District, or\r\nthe Confiscation of Southern Property as now threatened; and he thought\r\nbefore they would consent to consider this proposition they would\r\nrequire to be informed on these points.\r\n\r\n\"The President replied that 'unless he was expelled by the act of God or\r\nthe Confederate Armies, he should occupy that house for three years, and\r\nas long as he remained there, Maryland had nothing to fear, either for\r\nher Institutions or her interests, on the points referred to.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Crisfield immediately added: 'Mr. President, what you now say could\r\nbe heard by the people of Maryland, they would consider your proposition\r\nwith a much better feeling than I fear without it they will be inclined\r\nto do.'\r\n\r\n\"The President: 'That (meaning a publication of what he said), will not\r\ndo; it would force me into a quarrel before the proper time;' and again\r\nintimating, as he had before done, that a quarrel with the 'Greeley\r\nfaction' was impending, he said, 'he did not wish to encounter it before\r\nthe proper time, nor at all if it could be avoided.'\r\n\r\n\"Governor Wickliffe, of Kentucky, then asked him respecting the\r\nConstitutionality of his scheme.\r\n\r\n\"The President replied: 'As you may suppose, I have considered that; and\r\nthe proposition now submitted does not encounter any Constitutional\r\ndifficulty.  It proposes simply to co-operate with any State by giving\r\nsuch State pecuniary aid;' and he thought that the Resolution, as\r\nproposed by him, would be considered rather as the expression of a\r\nsentiment than as involving any Constitutional question.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hall, of Missouri, thought that if this proposition was adopted at\r\nall, it should be by the votes of the Free States, and come as a\r\nproposition from them to the Slave States, affording them an inducement\r\nto put aside this subject of discord; that it ought not to be expected\r\nthat members representing Slaveholding Constituencies should declare at\r\nonce, and in advance of any proposition to them, for the Emancipation of\r\nSlaves.\r\n\r\n\"The President said he saw and felt the force of the objection; it was a\r\nfearful responsibility, and every gentleman must do as he thought best;\r\nthat he did not know how this scheme was received by the Members from\r\nthe Free States; some of them had spoken to him and received it kindly;\r\nbut for the most part they were as reserved and chary as we had been,\r\nand he could not tell how they would vote.\r\n\r\n\"And, in reply to some expression of Mr. Hall as to his own opinion\r\nregarding Slavery, he said he did not pretend to disguise his\r\nAnti-Slavery feeling; that he thought it was wrong and should continue\r\nto think so; but that was not the question we had to deal with now.\r\nSlavery existed, and that, too, as well by the act of the North, as of\r\nthe South; and in any scheme to get rid of it, the North, as well as the\r\nSouth, was morally bound to do its full and equal share.  He thought the\r\nInstitution, wrong, and ought never to have existed; but yet he\r\nrecognized the rights of Property which had grown out of it, and would\r\nrespect those rights as fully as similar rights in any other property;\r\nthat Property can exist, and does legally exist.  He thought such a law,\r\nwrong, but the rights of Property resulting must be respected; he would\r\nget rid of the odious law, not by violating the right, but by\r\nencouraging the proposition, and offering inducements to give it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here the interview, so far as this subject is concerned, terminated by\r\nMr. Crittenden's assuring the President that whatever might be our final\r\naction, we all thought him solely moved by a high patriotism and sincere\r\ndevotion to the happiness and glory of his Country; and with that\r\nconviction we should consider respectfully the important suggestions he\r\nhad made.\r\n\r\n\"After some conversation on the current war news we retired, and I\r\nimmediately proceeded to my room and wrote out this paper.\r\n                              \"J. W. CRISFIELD.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were present at the interview described in the foregoing paper of\r\nMr. Crisfield, and we certify that the substance of what passed on the\r\noccasion is in this paper, faithfully and fully given.\r\n\r\n\"J.

Cobb, Haight, Lehman, and Sheffield) voted in the\r\naffirmative, and but two Republicans (Francis Thomas, and Leary) in the\r\nnegative.  On the 2nd of April, it passed the Senate by a vote of 32\r\nyeas--all Republicans save Messrs. Davis and Thomson--to 10 nays, all\r\nDemocrats.\r\n\r\nMeantime the question of the treatment of the \"Contraband\" in our\r\nMilitary camps, continued to grow in importance.\r\n\r\nOn March 26, 1862, General Hooker issued the following order touching\r\ncertain Fugitive Slaves and their alleged owners:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS, HOOKER'S DIVISION, CAMP BAKER,\r\n\"LOWER POTOMAC, March 26, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"To BRIGADE AND REGIMENTAL COMMANDERS OF THIS DIVISION:\r\n\r\n\"Messrs.  Nally, Gray, Dummington, Dent, Adams, Speake, Price, Posey,\r\nand Cobey, citizens of Maryland, have Negroes supposed to be with some\r\nof the regiments of this Division; the Brigadier General commanding\r\ndirects that they be permitted to visit all the camps of his command, in\r\nsearch of their Property, and if found, that they be allowed to take\r\npossession of the same, without any interference whatever.  Should any\r\nobstacle be thrown in their way by any officer or soldier in the\r\nDivision, they will be at once reported by the regimental commanders to\r\nthese headquarters.\r\n\r\n\"By command of Brigadier General Hooker;\r\n\r\n\"JOSEPH DICKINSON,\r\n\"Assistant Adjutant General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day, by direction of General Sickles, the following\r\nsignificant report was made touching the above order:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS, SECOND REGIMENT, EXCELSIOR BRIGADE.\r\n\"CAMP HALL, March 27, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"LIEUTENANT:--In compliance with verbal directions from Brigadier\r\nGeneral D. E. Sickles, to report as to the occurrence at this camp on\r\nthe afternoon of the 26th instant, I beg leave to submit the following:\r\n\r\n\"At about 3:30 o'clock P. M., March 26, 1862, admission within our lines\r\nwas demanded by a party of horsemen (civilians), numbering, perhaps,\r\nfifteen.  They presented the lieutenant commanding the guard, with an\r\norder of entrance from Brigadier General Joseph Hooker, Commanding\r\nDivision (copy appended), the order stating that nine men should be\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n\"I ordered that the balance of the party should remain without the\r\nlines; which was done.  Upon the appearance of the others, there was\r\nvisible dissatisfaction and considerable murmuring among the soldiers,\r\nto so great an extent that I almost feared for the safety of the\r\nSlaveholders.  At this time General Sickles opportunely arrived, and\r\ninstructed me to order them outside the camp, which I did, amidst the\r\nloud cheers of our soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"It is proper to add, that before entering our lines, and within about\r\nseventy-five or one hundred yards of our camp, one of their number\r\ndischarged two pistol shots at a Negro, who was running past them, with\r\nan evident intention of taking his life.  This justly enraged our men.\r\n\r\n          \"All of which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n                    \"Your obedient servant,\r\n                    \"JOHN TOLEN.\r\n               \"Major Commanding Second Regiment, E.

The General is of the opinion that\r\nthey bring much valuable information, which cannot be obtained from any\r\nother source.  They are acquainted with all the roads, paths, fords, and\r\nother natural features of the country, and they make excellent guides.\r\nThey also know and frequently have exposed the haunts of Secession spies\r\nand Traitors and the existence of Rebel organizations.  They will not,\r\ntherefore, be excluded.\r\n\r\n\"The General also directs me to say that civil process cannot be served\r\ndirectly in the camps or forts of his command, without full authority be\r\nobtained from the Commanding Officer for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"I am very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"E.

The vote on its passage in the Senate was\r\n29 yeas to 14 nays--all the yeas being Republican, and all but two of\r\nthe nays Democratic.\r\n\r\nApril 11th, the Bill passed the House by 92 yeas to 39 nays--all the\r\nyeas save 5 being Republican, and all the nays, save three, being\r\nDemocratic.\r\n\r\nApril 7, 1862, the House adopted a resolution, by 67 yeas to 52 nays\r\n--all the yeas, save one, Republican, and all the nays, save 12,\r\nDemocratic--for the appointment of a Select Committee of nine, to\r\nconsider and report whether any plan could be proposed and recommended\r\nfor the gradual Emancipation of all the African Slaves, and the\r\nextinction of Slavery in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, and Missouri, by the people or local authorities thereof, and\r\nhow far and in what way the Government of the United States could and\r\nought equitably to aid in facilitating either of those objects.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th President Lincoln sent the following Message to Congress:\r\n\r\n\"Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\n\"The Act entitled 'An Act for the release of certain Persons held to\r\nService or Labor in the District of Columbia,' has this day been\r\napproved and signed.\r\n\r\n\"I have never doubted the Constitutional authority of Congress to\r\nabolish Slavery in this District; and I have ever desired to see the\r\nNational Capital freed from the Institution in some satisfactory way.\r\nHence there has never been in my mind any question upon the subject\r\nexcept the one of expediency, arising in view of all the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"If there be matters within and about this Act which might have taken a\r\ncourse or shape more satisfactory to my judgment, I do not attempt to\r\nspecify them.  I am gratified that the two principles of compensation\r\nand colonization are both recognized and practically applied in the Act.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of compensation, it is provided that claims may be\r\npresented within ninety days from the passage of the Act, 'but not\r\nthereafter;' and there is no saving for minors, femmes covert, insane,\r\nor absent persons.  I presume this is an omission by mere oversight, and\r\nI recommend that it be supplied by an amendatory or Supplemental Act.\r\n\r\n\"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\"April 16, 1862.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in order to meet the President's views, such an amendatory\r\nor Supplemental Act was passed and approved.\r\n\r\nBut now, Major General Hunter having taken upon himself to issue an\r\nEmancipation proclamation, May 9, 1862, the President, May 19, 1862,\r\nissued a proclamation rescinding it as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas there appears in the public prints what purports to be a\r\nproclamation of Major General Hunter, in the words and figures\r\nfollowing, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"'HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,\r\n'HILTON HEAD, S. C., May 9, 1862.\r\n'[General Orders No.  11.]\r\n\r\n'The three States of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, comprising\r\nthe Military Department of the South, having deliberately declared\r\nthemselves no longer under the protection of the United States of\r\nAmerica, and having taken up arms against the said United States, it\r\nbecomes a Military necessity to declare them under Martial Law.  This\r\nwas accordingly done on the 25th day of April, 1862.  Slavery and\r\nMartial Law, in a Free Country, are altogether incompatible; the Persons\r\nin these three States--Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina-heretofore\r\nheld as Slaves, are therefore declared forever Free.\r\n\r\n'DAVID HUNTER,\r\n'Major-General Commanding.\r\n\r\n'Official:\r\nED.

And further, that neither General Hunter, nor\r\nany other Commander, or person, has been authorized by the Government of\r\nthe United States to make proclamations declaring the Slaves of any\r\nState Free; and that the supposed proclamation, now in question, whether\r\ngenuine or false, is altogether void, so far as respects such\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\n\"I further make known that whether it be competent for me, as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, to declare the Slaves of any\r\nState or States free, and whether, at any time, in any case, it shall\r\nhave become a necessity indispensable to the maintenance of the\r\nGovernment, to exercise such supposed power, are questions which, under\r\nmy responsibility, I reserve to myself, and which I cannot feel\r\njustified in leaving to the decision of Commanders in the field.  These\r\nare totally different questions from those of police regulations in\r\narmies and camps.\r\n\r\n\"On the sixth day of March last, by a Special Message, I recommended to\r\nCongress the adoption of a Joint Resolution to be substantially as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"' Resolved, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State\r\nwhich may adopt a gradual abolishment of Slavery, giving to such State\r\npecuniary aid, to be used by such State, in its discretion, to\r\ncompensate for the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such\r\nchange of system.'\r\n\r\n\"The Resolution, in the language above quoted, was adopted by large\r\nmajorities in both branches of Congress, and now stands an authentic,\r\ndefinite, and solemn proposal of the Nation to the States and people\r\nmost immediately interested in the subject-matter.  To the people of\r\nthose States I now earnestly appeal--I do not argue--I beseech you to\r\nmake the argument for yourselves--you cannot, if you would, be blind to\r\nthe signs of the times--I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration\r\nof them, ranging, if it may be, far above personal and partisan\r\npolitics.  This proposal makes common cause for a common object, casting\r\nno reproaches upon any.  It acts not the Pharisee.  The changes it\r\ncontemplates would come gently as the dews of Heaven, not rending or\r\nwrecking anything.  Will you not embrace it?  So much good has not been\r\ndone, by one effort, in all past time, as, in the providence of God, it\r\nis now your high privilege to do.  May the vast future not have to\r\nlament that you have neglected it.\r\n\r\n\"In witness thereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n\"Done at the city of Washington this nineteenth day of May, in the year\r\nof our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of the\r\nIndependence of the United States the eighty-sixth.\r\n\r\n\"By the President.

Let neither Military disaster, political faction, nor\r\nForeign War shake your settled purpose to enforce the equal operation of\r\nthe Laws of the United States upon the people of every State.\r\n\r\n\"The time has come when the Government must determine upon a Civil and\r\nMilitary policy, covering the whole ground of our National trouble.\r\n\r\n\"The responsibility of determining, declaring, and supporting such Civil\r\nand Military policy, and of directing the whole course of National\r\naffairs in regard to the Rebellion, must now be assumed and exercised by\r\nyou, or our Cause will be lost.  The Constitution gives you power, even\r\nfor the present terrible exigency.\r\n\r\n\"This Rebellion has assumed the character of a War; as such it should be\r\nregarded, and it should be conducted upon the highest principles known\r\nto Christian civilization.  It should not be a War looking to the\r\nsubjugation of the people of any State, in any event.  It should not be\r\nat all a war upon population, but against armed forces and political\r\norganizations.  Neither Confiscation of property, political executions\r\nof persons, territorial organizations of States, or forcible Abolition\r\nof Slavery, should be contemplated for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"In prosecuting the War, all private property and unarmed persons should\r\nbe strictly protected, subject only to the necessity of Military\r\noperations; all private property taken for Military use should be paid\r\nor receipted for; pillage and waste should be treated as high crimes;\r\nall unnecessary trespass sternly prohibited and offensive demeanor by\r\nthe military towards citizens promptly rebuked.\r\n\r\n\"Military arrests should not be tolerated, except in places where active\r\nhostilities exist; and oaths, not required by enactments,\r\nConstitutionally made, should be neither demanded nor received.\r\n\r\n\"Military Government should be confined to the preservation of public\r\norder and the protection of political right.  Military power should not\r\nbe allowed to interfere with the relations of Servitude, either by\r\nsupporting or impairing the authority of the master, except for\r\nrepressing disorder, as in other cases.  Slaves, contraband under the\r\nAct of Congress, seeking Military protection, should receive it.\r\n\r\n\"The right of the Government to appropriate permanently to its own\r\nservice claims to Slave-labor should be asserted, and the right of the\r\nowner to compensation therefor should be recognized.\r\n\r\n\"This principle might be extended, upon grounds of Military necessity\r\nand security, to all the Slaves of a particular State, thus working\r\nmanumission in such State; and in Missouri, perhaps in Western Virginia\r\nalso, and possibly even in Maryland, the expediency of such a measure is\r\nonly a question of time.\r\n\r\n\"A system of policy thus Constitutional, and pervaded by the influences\r\nof Christianity and Freedom, would receive the support of almost all\r\ntruly Loyal men, would deeply impress the Rebel masses and all foreign\r\nnations, and it might be humbly hoped that it would commend itself to\r\nthe favor of the Almighty.\r\n\r\n\"Unless the principles governing the future conduct of our Struggle\r\nshall be made known and approved, the effort to obtain requisite forces\r\nwill be almost hopeless.  A declaration of radical views, especially\r\nupon Slavery, will rapidly disintegrate our present Armies.\r\n\r\n\"The policy of the Government must be supported by concentrations of\r\nMilitary power.  The National Forces should not be dispersed in\r\nexpeditions, posts of occupation, and numerous armies, but should be\r\nmainly collected into masses, and brought to bear upon the Armies of the\r\nConfederate States.  Those Armies thoroughly defeated, the political\r\nstructure which they support would soon cease to exist,\r\n\r\n\"In carrying out any system of policy which you may form, you will\r\nrequire a Commander-in-chief of the Army, one who possesses your\r\nconfidence, understands your views, and who is competent to execute your\r\norders, by directing the Military Forces of the Nation to the\r\naccomplishment of the objects by you proposed.  I do not ask that place\r\nfor myself, I am willing to serve you in such position as you may assign\r\nme, and I will do so as faithfully as ever subordinate served superior.\r\n\r\n\"I may be on the brink of Eternity; and as I hope forgiveness from my\r\nMaker, I have written this letter with sincerity towards you and from\r\nlove for my Country.\r\n\r\n\"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN,\r\n\"Major-General Commanding.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency A. LINCOLN, President.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 12, 1862, Senators and Representatives of the Border Slave-holding\r\nStates, having been specially invited to the White House for the\r\npurpose, were addressed by President Lincoln, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN:--After the adjournment of Congress, now near, I shall have\r\nno opportunity of seeing you for several months.  Believing that you of\r\nthe Border States hold more power for good than any other equal number\r\nof members, I feel it a duty which I cannot justifiably waive, to make\r\nthis appeal to you.\r\n\r\n\"I intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you that, in my\r\nopinion, if you all had voted for the Resolution in the Gradual\r\nEmancipation Message of last March, the War would now be substantially\r\nended.  And the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most potent and\r\nswift means of ending it.  Let the States which are in Rebellion see\r\ndefinitely and certainly that in no event will the States you represent\r\never join their proposed Confederacy, and they cannot much longer\r\nmaintain the contest.\r\n\r\n\"But you cannot divest them of their hope to ultimately have you with\r\nthem so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the Institution\r\nwithin your own States.  Beat them at elections, as you have\r\noverwhelmingly done, and nothing daunted, they still claim you as their\r\nown.  You and I know what the lever of their power is.  Break that lever\r\nbefore their faces, and they can shake you no more forever.\r\n\r\n\"Most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration, and I\r\ntrust you will not now think I improperly touch what is exclusively your\r\nown, when, for the sake of the whole Country, I ask, 'Can you, for your\r\nStates, do better than to take the course I urge?' Discarding punctilio\r\nand maxims adapted to more manageable times, and looking only to the\r\nunprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do better in any\r\npossible event?\r\n\r\n\"You prefer that the Constitutional relations of the States to the\r\nNation shall be practically restored without disturbance of the\r\nInstitution; and, if this were done, my whole duty, in this respect,\r\nunder the Constitution and my oath of office, would be performed.  But\r\nit is not done, and we are trying to accomplish it by War.\r\n\r\n\"The incidents of the War cannot be avoided.  If the War continues long,\r\nas it must, if the object be not sooner attained, the Institution in\r\nyour States will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion--by the\r\nmere incidents of the War.  It will be gone, and you will have nothing\r\nvaluable in lieu of it.  Much of its value is gone already.\r\n\r\n\"How much better for you and for your people to take the step which at\r\nonce shortens the War and secures substantial compensation for that\r\nwhich is sure to be wholly lost in any other event!  How much better to\r\nthus save the money which else we sink forever in the War!  How: much\r\nbetter to do it while we can, lest the War ere long render us\r\npecuniarily unable to do it!  How much better for you, as seller, and\r\nthe Nation, as buyer, to sell out and buy out that without which the War\r\ncould never have been, than to sink both the thing to be sold and the\r\nprice of it in cutting one another's throats!\r\n\r\n\"I do not speak of Emancipation at once, but of a decision at once to\r\nEmancipate gradually.  Room in South America for colonization can be\r\nobtained cheaply and in abundance, and when numbers shall be large\r\nenough to be company and encouragement for one another, the freed people\r\nwill not be so reluctant to go.\r\n\r\n\"I am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned; one which threatens\r\ndivision among those who, united, are none too strong.  An instance of\r\nit is known to you.  General Hunter is an honest man.  He was, and I\r\nhope still is, my friend.  I value him none the less for his agreeing\r\nwith me in the general wish that all men everywhere could be freed.  He\r\nproclaimed all men Free within certain States, and I repudiated the\r\nproclamation.  He expected more good and less harm from the measure than\r\nI could believe would follow.\r\n\r\n\"Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not offense, to many\r\nwhose support the Country cannot afford to lose.  And this is not the\r\nend of it.  The pressure in this direction is still upon me, and is\r\nincreasing.  By conceding what I now ask, you can relieve me, and, much\r\nmore, can relieve the Country in this important point.\r\n\r\n\"Upon these considerations I have again begged your attention to the\r\nMessage of March last.  Before leaving the Capitol, consider and discuss\r\nit among yourselves.  You are Patriots and Statesmen, and as such I pray\r\nyou consider this proposition; and, at the least, commend it to the\r\nconsideration of your States and people.  As you would perpetuate\r\npopular Government for the best people in the World, I beseech you that\r\nyou do in nowise omit this.\r\n\r\n\"Our common Country is in great peril, demanding the loftiest views and\r\nboldest action to bring a speedy relief.  Once relieved, its form of\r\nGovernment is saved to the World, its beloved history and cherished\r\nmemories are vindicated, and its happy future fully assured and rendered\r\ninconceivable grand.  To you, more than to any others, the privilege is\r\ngiven to assure that happiness and swell that grandeur, and to link your\r\nown names therewith forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen representing in Congress the Border-States, to whom this\r\naddress was made, subsequently met and discussed its subject matter, and\r\nmade written reply in the shape of majority and minority replies, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nTHE MAJORITY REPLY:\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON, July 14, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"TO THE PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned, Representatives of Kentucky, Virginia, Missouri, and\r\nMaryland, in the two Houses of Congress, have listened to your address\r\nwith the profound sensibility naturally inspired by the high source from\r\nwhich it emanates, the earnestness which marked its delivery, and the\r\noverwhelming importance of the subject of which it treats.  We have\r\ngiven it a most respectful consideration, and now lay before you our\r\nresponse.  We regret that want of time has not permitted us to make it\r\nmore perfect.\r\n\r\n\"We have not been wanting, Mr. President, in respect to you, and in\r\ndevotion to the Constitution and the Union.  We have not been\r\nindifferent to the great difficulties surrounding you, compared with\r\nwhich all former National troubles have been but as the summer cloud;\r\nand we have freely given you our sympathy and support.  Repudiating the\r\ndangerous heresies of the Secessionists, we believed, with you, that the\r\nWar on their part is aggressive and wicked, and the objects for which it\r\nwas to be prosecuted on ours, defined by your Message at the opening of\r\nthe present Congress, to be such as all good men should approve.\r\n\r\n\"We have not hesitated to vote all supplies necessary to carry it on\r\nvigorously.  We have voted all the men and money you have asked for, and\r\neven more; we have imposed onerous taxes on our people, and they are\r\npaying them with cheerfulness and alacrity; we have encouraged\r\nenlistments, and sent to the field many of our best men; and some of our\r\nnumber have offered their persons to the enemy as pledges of their\r\nsincerity and devotion to the Country.\r\n\r\n\"We have done all this under the most discouraging circumstances, and in\r\nthe face of measures most distasteful to us and injurious to the\r\ninterests we represent, and in the hearing of doctrines avowed by those\r\nwho claim to be your friends, must be abhorrent to us and our\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n\"But, for all this, we have never faltered, nor shall we as long as we\r\nhave a Constitution to defend and a Government which protects us.  And\r\nwe are ready for renewed efforts, and even greater sacrifices, yea, any\r\nsacrifice, when we are satisfied it is required to preserve our\r\nadmirable form of Government and the priceless blessings of\r\nConstitutional Liberty.\r\n\r\n\"A few of our number voted for the Resolution recommended by your\r\nMessage of the 6th of March last, the greater portion of us did not, and\r\nwe will briefly state the prominent reasons which influenced our action.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, it proposed a radical change of our social system,\r\nand was hurried through both Houses with undue haste, without reasonable\r\ntime for consideration and debate, and with no time at all for\r\nconsultation with our constituents, whose interests it deeply involved.\r\nIt seemed like an interference by this Government with a question which\r\npeculiarly and exclusively belonged to our respective States, on which\r\nthey had not sought advice or solicited aid.\r\n\r\n\"Many of us doubted the Constitutional power of this Government to make\r\nappropriations of money for the object designated, and all of us thought\r\nour finances were in no condition to bear the immense outlay which its\r\nadoption and faithful execution would impose upon the National Treasury.\r\nIf we pause but a moment to think of the debt its acceptance would have\r\nentailed, we are appalled by its magnitude.  The proposition was\r\naddressed to all the States, and embraced the whole number of Slaves.\r\n\r\n\"According to the census of 1860 there were then nearly four million\r\nSlaves in the Country; from natural increase they exceed that number\r\nnow.  At even the low average of $300, the price fixed by the\r\nEmancipation Act for the Slaves of this District, and greatly below\r\ntheir real worth, their value runs up to the enormous sum of\r\n$1,200,000,000; and if to that we add the cost of deportation and\r\ncolonization, at $100 each, which is but a fraction more than is\r\nactually paid--by the Maryland Colonization Society, we have\r\n$400,000,000 more.\r\n\r\n\"We were not willing to impose a tax on our people sufficient to pay the\r\ninterest on that sum, in addition to the vast and daily increasing debt\r\nalready fixed upon them by exigencies of the War, and if we had been\r\nwilling, the Country could not bear it.  Stated in this form the\r\nproposition is nothing less than the deportation from the Country of\r\n$1,600,000,000 worth of producing labor, and the substitution, in its\r\nplace, of an interest-bearing debt of the same amount.\r\n\r\n\"But, if we are told that it was expected that only the States we\r\nrepresent would accept the proposition, we respectfully submit that even\r\nthen it involves a sum too great for the financial ability of this\r\nGovernment at this time.  According to the census of 1860:\r\n\r\n                                   Slaves\r\n          Kentucky had ........... 225,490\r\n          Maryland ...............  87,188\r\n          Virginia ............... 490,887\r\n          Delaware ...............   1,798\r\n          Missouri ............... 114,965\r\n          Tennessee .............. 275,784\r\n\r\n          Making in the whole .. 1,196,112\r\n\r\n          At the same rate of valuation these would\r\n          amount to ......... $358,933,500\r\n\r\n          Add for deportation and colonization $100\r\n          each ............... 118,244,533\r\n\r\n          And we have the\r\n          enormous sum of ... $478,038,133\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We did not feel that we should be justified in voting for a measure\r\nwhich, if carried out, would add this vast amount to our public debt at\r\na moment when the Treasury was reeling under the enormous expenditure of\r\nthe War.\r\n\r\n\"Again, it seemed to us that this Resolution was but the annunciation of\r\na sentiment which could not or was not likely to be reduced to an actual\r\ntangible proposition.  No movement was then made to provide and\r\nappropriate the funds required to carry it into effect; and we were not\r\nencouraged to believe that funds would be provided.  And our belief has\r\nbeen fully justified by subsequent events.\r\n\r\n\"Not to mention other circumstances, it is quite sufficient for our\r\npurpose to bring to your notice the fact that, while this resolution was\r\nunder consideration in the Senate, our colleague, the Senator from\r\nKentucky, moved an amendment appropriating $500,000 to the object\r\ntherein designated, and it was voted down with great unanimity.\r\n\r\n\"What confidence, then, could we reasonably feel that if we committed\r\nourselves to the policy it proposed, our constituents would reap the\r\nfruits of the promise held out; and on what ground could we, as fair\r\nmen, approach them and challenge their support?\r\n\r\n\"The right to hold Slaves, is a right appertaining to all the States of\r\nthis Union.  They have the right to cherish or abolish the Institution,\r\nas their tastes or their interests may prompt, and no one is authorized\r\nto question the right or limit the enjoyment.  And no one has more\r\nclearly affirmed that right than you have.  Your Inaugural Address does\r\nyou great honor in this respect, and inspired the Country with\r\nconfidence in your fairness and respect for the Law.  Our States are in\r\nthe enjoyment of that right.\r\n\r\n\"We do not feel called on to defend the Institution or to affirm it is\r\none which ought to be cherished; perhaps, if we were to make the\r\nattempt, we might find that we differ even among ourselves.  It is\r\nenough for our purpose to know that it is a right; and, so knowing, we\r\ndid not see why we should now be expected to yield it.\r\n\r\n\"We had contributed our full share to relieve the Country at this\r\nterrible crisis; we had done as much as had been required of others in\r\nlike circumstances; and we did not see why sacrifices should be expected\r\nof us from which others, no more loyal, were exempt.  Nor could we see\r\nwhat good the Nation would derive from it.\r\n\r\n\"Such a sacrifice submitted to by us would not have strengthened the arm\r\nof this Government or weakened that of the Enemy.  It was not necessary\r\nas a pledge of our Loyalty, for that had been manifested beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt, in every form, and at every place possible.  There was\r\nnot the remotest probability that the States we represent would join in\r\nthe Rebellion, nor is there now, or of their electing to go with the\r\nSouthern Section in the event of a recognition of the Independence of\r\nany part of the disaffected region.\r\n\r\n\"Our States are fixed unalterably in their resolution to adhere to and\r\nsupport the Union.  They see no safety for themselves, and no hope for\r\nConstitutional Liberty, but by its preservation.  They will, under no\r\ncircumstances, consent to its dissolution; and we do them no more than\r\njustice when we assure you that, while the War is conducted to prevent\r\nthat deplorable catastrophe, they will sustain it as long as they can\r\nmuster a man, or command a dollar.\r\n\r\n\"Nor will they ever consent, in any event, to unite with the Southern\r\nConfederacy.  The bitter fruits of the peculiar doctrines of that region\r\nwill forever prevent them from placing their security and happiness in\r\nthe custody of an association which has incorporated in its Organic Law\r\nthe seeds of its own destruction.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot admit, Mr. President, that if we had voted for the Resolution\r\nin the Emancipation Message of March last, the War would now be\r\nsubstantially ended.  We are unable to see how our action in this\r\nparticular has given, or could give, encouragement to the Rebellion.\r\nThe Resolution has passed; and if there be virtue in it, it will be\r\nquite as efficacious as if we had voted for it.\r\n\r\n\"We have no power to bind our States in this respect by our votes here;\r\nand, whether we had voted the one way or the other, they are in the same\r\ncondition of freedom to accept or reject its provisions.\r\n\r\n\"No, Sir, the War has not been prolonged or hindered by our action on\r\nthis or any other measure.  We must look for other causes for that\r\nlamented fact.  We think there is not much difficulty, not much\r\nuncertainty, in pointing out others far more probable and potent in\r\ntheir agencies to that end.\r\n\r\n\"The Rebellion derives its strength from the Union of all classes in the\r\nInsurgent States; and while that Union lasts the War will never end\r\nuntil they are utterly exhausted.  We know that, at the inception of\r\nthese troubles, Southern society was divided, and that a large portion,\r\nperhaps a majority, were opposed to Secession.  Now the great mass of\r\nSouthern people are united.\r\n\r\n\"To discover why they are so, we must glance at Southern society, and\r\nnotice the classes into which it has been divided, and which still\r\ndistinguish it.  They are in arms, but not for the same objects; they\r\nare moved to a common end, but by different and even inconsistent\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\"The leaders, which comprehend what was previously known as the State\r\nRights Party, and is much the lesser class, seek to break down National\r\nIndependence and set up State domination.  With them it is a War against\r\nNationality.\r\n\r\n\"The other class is fighting, as it supposes, to maintain and preserve\r\nits rights of Property and domestic safety, which it has been made to\r\nbelieve are assailed by this Government.  This latter class are not\r\nDisunionists per se; they are so only because they have been made to\r\nbelieve that this Administration is inimical to their rights, and is\r\nmaking War on their domestic Institutions.  As long as these two classes\r\nact together they will never assent to a Peace.\r\n\r\n\"The policy, then, to be pursued, is obvious.  The former class will\r\nnever be reconciled, but the latter may be.  Remove their apprehensions;\r\nsatisfy them that no harm is intended to them and their Institutions;\r\nthat this Government is not making War on their rights of Property, but\r\nis simply defending its legitimate authority, and they will gladly\r\nreturn to their allegiance as soon as the pressure of Military dominion\r\nimposed by the Confederate authority is removed from them.\r\n\r\n\"Twelve months ago, both Houses of Congress, adopting the spirit of your\r\nMessage, then but recently sent in, declared with singular unanimity the\r\nobjects of the War, and the Country instantly bounded to your side to\r\nassist you in carrying it on.  If the spirit of that Resolution had been\r\nadhered to, we are confident that we should before now have seen the end\r\nof this deplorable conflict.  But what have we seen?\r\n\r\n\"In both Houses of Congress we have heard doctrines subversive of the\r\nprinciples of the Constitution, and seen measure after measure, founded\r\nin substance on those doctrines, proposed and carried through, which can\r\nhave no other effect than to distract and divide loyal men, and\r\nexasperate and drive still further from us and their duty the people of\r\nthe rebellious States.\r\n\r\n\"Military officers, following these bad examples, have stepped beyond\r\nthe just limits of their authority in the same direction, until in\r\nseveral instances you have felt the necessity of interfering to arrest\r\nthem.  And even the passage of the Resolution to which you refer has\r\nbeen ostentatiously proclaimed as the triumph of a principle which the\r\npeople of the Southern States regard as ruinous to them.  The effect of\r\nthese measures was foretold, and may now be seen in the indurated state\r\nof Southern feeling.\r\n\r\n\"To these causes, Mr. President, and not to our omission to vote for the\r\nResolution recommended by you, we solemnly believe we are to attribute\r\nthe terrible earnestness of those in arms against the Government, and\r\nthe continuance of the War.  Nor do we (permit us to say, Mr. President,\r\nwith all respect to you) agree that the Institution of Slavery is 'the\r\nlever of their power,' but we are of the opinion that 'the lever of\r\ntheir power' is the apprehension that the powers of a common Government,\r\ncreated for common and equal protection to the interests of all, will be\r\nwielded against the Institutions of the Southern States.\r\n\r\n\"There is one other idea in your address we feel called on to notice.\r\nAfter stating the fact of your repudiation of General Hunter's\r\nProclamation, you add:\r\n\r\n\"'Yet, in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not offense, to\r\nmany whose support the Country cannot afford to lose.  And this is not\r\nthe end of it.  The pressure in this direction is still upon me and is\r\nincreasing.  By conceding what I now ask, you can relieve me, and, much\r\nmore, can relieve the Country, in this important point,'\r\n\r\n\"We have anxiously looked into this passage to discover its true import,\r\nbut we are yet in painful uncertainty.  How can we, by conceding what\r\nyou now ask, relieve you and the Country from the increasing pressure to\r\nwhich you refer?  We will not allow ourselves to think that the\r\nproposition is, that we consent to give up Slavery, to the end that the\r\nHunter proclamation may be let loose on the Southern people, for it is\r\ntoo well known that we would not be parties to any such measure, and we\r\nhave too much respect for you to imagine you would propose it.\r\n\r\n\"Can it mean that by sacrificing our interest in Slavery we appease the\r\nspirit that controls that pressure, cause it to be withdrawn, and rid\r\nthe Country of the pestilent agitation of the Slavery question?  We are\r\nforbidden so to think, for that spirit would not be satisfied with the\r\nliberation of 100,000 Slaves, and cease its agitation while 3,000,000\r\nremain in bondage.  Can it mean that by abandoning Slavery in our States\r\nwe are removing the pressure from you and the Country, by preparing for\r\na separation on the line of the Cotton States?\r\n\r\n\"We are forbidden so to think, because it is known that we are, and we\r\nbelieve that you are, unalterably opposed to any division at all.  We\r\nwould prefer to think that you desire this concession as a pledge of our\r\nsupport, and thus enable you to withstand a pressure which weighs\r\nheavily on you and the Country.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, no such sacrifice is necessary to secure our support.\r\nConfine yourself to your Constitutional authority; confine your\r\nsubordinates within the same limits; conduct this War solely for the\r\npurpose of restoring the Constitution to its legitimate authority;\r\nconcede to each State and its loyal citizens their just rights, and we\r\nare wedded to you by indissoluble ties.  Do this, Mr. President, and you\r\ntouch the American heart, and invigorate it with new hope.  You will, as\r\nwe solemnly believe, in due time restore Peace to your Country, lift it\r\nfrom despondency to a future of glory, and preserve to your countrymen,\r\ntheir posterity, and man, the inestimable treasure of a Constitutional\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. President, we have stated with frankness and candor the reasons on\r\nwhich we forbore to vote for the Resolution you have mentioned; but you\r\nhave again presented this proposition, and appealed to us with an\r\nearnestness and eloquence which have not failed to impress us, to\r\n'consider it, and at the least to commend it to the consideration of our\r\nStates and people.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus appealed to by the Chief Magistrate of our beloved Country, in the\r\nhour of its greatest peril, we cannot wholly decline.  We are willing to\r\ntrust every question relating to their interest and happiness to the\r\nconsideration and ultimate judgment of our own people.\r\n\r\n\"While differing from you as to the necessity of Emancipating the Slaves\r\nof our States as a means of putting down the Rebellion, and while\r\nprotesting against the propriety of any extra-territorial interference\r\nto induce the people of our States to adopt any particular line of\r\npolicy on a subject which peculiarly and exclusively belongs to them,\r\nyet, when you and our brethren of the Loyal States sincerely believe\r\nthat the retention of Slavery by us is an obstacle to Peace and National\r\nharmony, and are willing to contribute pecuniary aid to compensate our\r\nStates and people for the inconveniences produced by such a change of\r\nsystem, we are not unwilling that our people shall consider the\r\npropriety of putting it aside.\r\n\r\n\"But we have already said that we regard this Resolution as the\r\nutterance of a sentiment, and we had no confidence that it would assume\r\nthe shape of a tangible practical proposition, which would yield the\r\nfruits of the sacrifice it required.  Our people are influenced by the\r\nsame want of confidence, and will not consider the proposition in its\r\npresent impalpable form.  The interest they are asked to give up is, to\r\nthem, of immense importance, and they ought not to be expected even to\r\nentertain the proposal until they are assured that when they accept it\r\ntheir just expectations will not be frustrated.\r\n\r\n\"We regard your plan as a proposition from the Nation to the States to\r\nexercise an admitted Constitutional right in a particular manner, and\r\nyield up a valuable interest.  Before they ought to consider the\r\nproposition, it should be presented in such a tangible, practical,\r\nefficient shape, as to command their confidence that its fruits are\r\ncontingent only upon their acceptance.  We cannot trust anything to the\r\ncontingencies of future legislation.\r\n\r\n\"If Congress, by proper and necessary legislation, shall provide\r\nsufficient funds and place them at your disposal to be applied by you to\r\nthe payment of any of our States, or the citizens thereof, who shall\r\nadopt the Abolishment of Slavery, either gradual or immediate, as they\r\nmay determine, and the expense of deportation and colonization of the\r\nliberated Slaves, then will our States and people take this proposition\r\ninto careful consideration, for such decision as in their judgment is\r\ndemanded by their interest, their honor, and their duty to the whole\r\nCountry.  We have the honor to be, with great respect,\r\n\r\n\"C. A. WICKLIFFE, Ch'man,\r\nCHAS. B. CALVERT,\r\nGARRETT DAVIS,\r\nC. L. L. LEARY,\r\nR. WILSON,\r\nEDWIN H. WEBSTER,\r\nJ. J. CRITTENDEN,\r\nR.

PRESIDENT:--The undersigned, members of Congress from the Border\r\nStates, in response to your address of Saturday last, beg leave to say\r\nthat they attended a meeting, on the same day the address was delivered,\r\nfor the purpose of considering the same.  The meeting appointed a\r\nCommittee to report a response to your address.  That report was made on\r\nyesterday, and the action of the majority indicated clearly that the\r\nresponse, or one in substance the same, would be adopted and presented\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n\"Inasmuch as we cannot, consistently with our own sense of duty to the\r\nCountry, under the existing perils which surround us, concur in that\r\nresponse, we feel it to be due to you and to ourselves to make to you a\r\nbrief and candid answer over our own signatures.\r\n\r\n\"We believe that the whole power of the Government, upheld and sustained\r\nby all the influences and means of all loyal men in all Sections, and of\r\nall Parties, is essentially necessary to put down the Rebellion and\r\npreserve the Union and the Constitution.  We understand your appeal to\r\nus to have been made for the purpose of securing this result.\r\n\r\n\"A very large portion of the People in the Northern States believe that\r\nSlavery is the 'lever-power of the Rebellion.'  It matters not whether\r\nthis belief be well-founded or not.  The belief does exist, and we have\r\nto deal with things as they are, and not as we would have them be.\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of the existence of this belief, we understand that an\r\nimmense pressure is brought to bear for the purpose of striking down\r\nthis Institution through the exercise of Military authority.  The\r\nGovernment cannot maintain this great struggle if the support and\r\ninfluence of the men who entertain these opinions be withdrawn.  Neither\r\ncan the Government hope for early success if the support of that element\r\ncalled \"Conservative\" be withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\"Such being the condition of things, the President appeals to the\r\nBorder-State men to step forward and prove their patriotism by making\r\nthe first sacrifice.  No doubt, like appeals have been made to extreme\r\nmen in the North to meet us half-way, in order that the whole moral,\r\npolitical, pecuniary, and physical force of the Nation may be firmly and\r\nearnestly united in one grand effort to save the Union and the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\"Believing that such were the motives that prompted your Address, and\r\nsuch the results to which it looked, we cannot reconcile it to our sense\r\nof duty, in this trying hour, to respond in a spirit of fault-finding or\r\nquerulousness over the things that are past.\r\n\r\n\"We are not disposed to seek for the cause of present misfortunes in the\r\nerrors and wrongs of others who now propose to unite with us in a common\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\"But, on the other hand, we meet your address in the spirit in which it\r\nwas made, and, as loyal Americans, declare to you and to the World that\r\nthere is no sacrifice that we are not ready to make to save the\r\nGovernment and institutions of our fathers.  That we, few of us though\r\nthere may be, will permit no man, from the North or from the South, to\r\ngo further than we in the accomplishment of the great work before us.\r\nThat, in order to carry out these views, we will, so far as may be in\r\nour power, ask the people of the Border States calmly, deliberately, and\r\nfairly to consider your recommendations.\r\n\r\n\"We are the more emboldened to assume this position from the fact, now\r\nbecome history, that the leaders of the Southern Rebellion have offered\r\nto abolish Slavery among them as a condition to foreign intervention in\r\nfavor of their Independence as a Nation.\r\n\r\n\"If they can give up Slavery to destroy the Union, we can surely ask our\r\npeople to consider the question of Emancipation to save the Union.\r\n\r\n\"With great respect, your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n\"JOHN W. NOELL,\r\n\"SAMUEL L. CASEY,\r\n\"GEORGE P. FISHER,\r\n\"A. J. CLEMENTS,\r\n\"WILLIAM G. BROWN,\r\n\"JACOB B. BLAIR,\r\n\"W. T. WILLEY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     [The following separate replies, subsequently made, by\r\n     Representative Maynard of Tennessee, and Senator Henderson of\r\n     Missouri, are necessarily given to complete this part of the Border\r\n     State record.]\r\n\r\n                           MR. MAYNARD'S REPLY.\r\n\r\n\"HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, July 16, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"SIR:--The magnitude and gravity of the proposition submitted by you to\r\nRepresentatives from the Slave States would naturally occasion\r\ndiversity, if not contrariety, of opinion.  You will not, therefore, be\r\nsurprised that I have not been able to concur in view with the majority\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\"This is attributable, possibly, to the fact that my State is not a\r\nBorder State, properly so called, and that my immediate constituents are\r\nnot yet disenthralled from the hostile arms of the Rebellion.  This fact\r\nis a physical obstacle in the way of my now submitting to their\r\nconsideration this, or any other proposition looking to political\r\naction, especially such as, in this case, would require a change in the\r\nOrganic Law of the State.\r\n\r\n\"But do not infer that I am insensible to your appeal.  I am not; you\r\nare surrounded with difficulties far greater than have embarrassed any\r\nof your predecessors.  You need the support of every American citizen,\r\nand you ought to have it--active, zealous and honest.  The union of all\r\nUnion men to aid you in preserving the Union, is the duty of the time.\r\nDifferences as to policy and methods must be subordinated to the common\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\"In looking for the cause of this Rebellion, it is natural that each\r\nSection and each Party should ascribe as little blame as possible to\r\nitself, and as much as possible to its opponent Section and Party.\r\nPossibly you and I might not agree on a comparison of our views.  That\r\nthere should be differences of opinion as to the best mode of conducting\r\nour Military operations, and the best men to lead our Armies, is equally\r\nnatural.  Contests on such questions weaken ourselves and strengthen our\r\nenemies.  They are unprofitable, and possibly unpatriotic.  Somebody\r\nmust yield, or we waste our strength in a contemptible struggle among\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\"You appeal to the loyal men of the Slave States to sacrifice something\r\nof feeling and a great deal of interest.  The sacrifices they have\r\nalready made and the sufferings they have endured give the best\r\nassurance that the appeal will not have been made in vain.  He who is\r\nnot ready to yield all his material interests, and to forego his most\r\ncherished sentiments and opinions for the preservation of his Country,\r\nalthough he may have periled his life on the battle-field in her\r\ndefense, is but half a Patriot.  Among the loyal people that I\r\nrepresent, there are no half-patriots.\r\n\r\n\"Already the Rebellion has cost us much, even to our undoing; we are\r\ncontent, if need be, to give up the rest, to suppress it.  We have stood\r\nby you from the beginning of this struggle, and we mean to stand by you,\r\nGod willing, till the end of it.\r\n\r\n\"I did not vote for the Resolution to which you allude, solely for the\r\nreason that I was absent at the Capital of my own State.  It is right.\r\n\r\n\"Should any of the Slave States think proper to terminate that\r\nInstitution, as several of them, I understand, or at least some of their\r\ncitizens propose, justice and a generous comity require that the Country\r\nshould interpose to aid in lessening the burden, public and private,\r\noccasioned by so radical a change in its social and industrial\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\"I will not now speculate upon the effect, at home or abroad, of the\r\nadoption of your policy, nor inquire what action of the Rebel leaders\r\nhas rendered something of the kind important.  Your whole administration\r\ngives the highest assurance that you are moved, not so much from a\r\ndesire to see all men everywhere made free, as from a higher desire to\r\npreserve free institutions for the benefit of men already free; not to\r\nmake Slaves, Freemen, but to prevent Freemen from being made Slaves; not\r\nto destroy an Institution, which a portion of us only consider bad, but\r\nto save institutions which we all alike consider good.  I am satisfied\r\nyou would not ask from any of your fellow-citizens a sacrifice not, in\r\nyour judgment, imperatively required by the safety of the Country.\r\n\r\n\"This is the spirit of your appeal, and I respond to it in the same\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\"I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                              \"HORACE MAYNARD.\r\n\r\n\"To the PRESIDENT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SENATOR HENDERSON'S REPLY.\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON CITY, July 21, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"MR. PRESIDENT:--The pressure of business in the Senate during the last\r\nfew days of the session prevented my attendance at the meeting of the\r\nBorder-State members, called to consider your proposition in reference\r\nto gradual emancipation in our States.\r\n\r\n\"It is for this reason only, and not because I fail to appreciate their\r\nimportance or properly respect your suggestions, that my name does not\r\nappear to any of the several papers submitted in response.  I may also\r\nadd that it was my intention, when the subject came up practically for\r\nconsideration in the Senate, to express fully my views in regard to it.\r\nThis of course would have rendered any other response unnecessary.  But\r\nthe want of time to consider the matter deprived me of that opportunity,\r\nand, lest now my silence be misconstrued, I deem it proper to say to you\r\nthat I am by no means indifferent to the great questions so earnestly,\r\nand as I believe so honestly, urged by you upon our consideration.\r\n\r\n\"The Border States, so far, are the chief sufferers by this War, and the\r\ntrue Union men of those States have made the greatest sacrifices for the\r\npreservation of the Government.  This fact does not proceed from\r\nmismanagement on the part of the Union authorities, or a want of regard\r\nfor our people, but it is the necessary result of the War that is upon\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"Our States are the battle-fields.  Our people, divided among\r\nthemselves, maddened by the struggle, and blinded by the smoke of\r\nbattle, invited upon our soil contending armies--the one to destroy the\r\nGovernment, the other to maintain it.  The consequence to us is plain.\r\nThe shock of the contest upturns Society and desolates the Land.  We\r\nhave made sacrifices, but at last they were only the sacrifices demanded\r\nby duty, and unless we are willing to make others, indeed any that the\r\ngood of the Country, involved in the overthrow of Treason, may expect at\r\nour hands, our title to patriotism is not complete.\r\n\r\n\"When you submitted your proposition to Congress, in March last, 'that\r\nthe United States ought to co-operate with any State which may adopt a\r\ngradual abolishment of Slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to\r\nbe used by such State in its discretion, to compensate for the\r\ninconveniences, public and private, produced by such change of system,'\r\nI gave it a most cheerful support, and I am satisfied it would have\r\nreceived the approbation of a large majority of the Border States\r\ndelegations in both Branches of Congress, if, in the first place, they\r\nhad believed the War, with its continued evils--the most prominent of\r\nwhich, in a material point of view, is its injurious effect on the\r\nInstitution of Slavery in our States--could possibly have been\r\nprotracted for another twelve months; and if, in the second place, they\r\nhad felt assured that the party having the majority in Congress would,\r\nlike yourself, be equally prompt in practical action as in the\r\nexpression of a sentiment.\r\n\r\n\"While scarcely any one doubted your own sincerity in the premises, and\r\nyour earnest wish speedily to terminate the War, you can readily\r\nconceive the grounds for difference of opinion where conclusions could\r\nonly be based on conjecture.\r\n\r\n\"Believing, as I did, that the War was not so near its termination as\r\nsome supposed, and feeling disposed to accord to others the same\r\nsincerity of purpose that I should claim for myself under similar\r\ncircumstances, I voted for the proposition.  I will suppose that others\r\nwere actuated by no sinister motives.\r\n\r\n\"In doing so, Mr. President, I desire to be distinctly understood by you\r\nand by my constituents.  I did not suppose at the time that I was\r\npersonally making any sacrifice by supporting the Resolution, nor that\r\nthe people of my State were called upon to make any sacrifices, either\r\nin considering or accepting the proposition, if they saw fit.\r\n\r\n\"I agreed with you in the remarks contained in the Message accompanying\r\nthe Resolution, that 'the Union must be preserved, and hence all\r\nindispensable means must be employed.  * * * War has been and continues\r\nto be an indispensable means to this end.  A practical reacknowledgment\r\nof the National authority would render the War unnecessary, and it would\r\nat once cease.  If, however, resistance continues, the War must also\r\ncontinue; and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may\r\nattend and all the ruin which may follow it.'\r\n\r\n\"It is truly 'impossible' to foresee all the evils resulting from a War\r\nso stupendous as the present.  I shall be much rejoiced if something\r\nmore dreadful than the sale of Freedom to a few Slaves in the Border\r\nStates shall not result from it.\r\n\r\n\"If it closes with the Government of our Fathers secure, and\r\nConstitutional Liberty in all its purity guaranteed to the White man,\r\nthe result will be better than that having a place in the fears of many\r\ngood men at present, and much better than the past history of such\r\nrevolutions can justify us in expecting.\r\n\r\n\"In this period of the Nation's distress, I know of no human institution\r\ntoo sacred for discussion; no material interest belonging to the citizen\r\nthat he should not willingly place upon the altar of his Country, if\r\ndemanded by the public good.\r\n\r\n\"The man who cannot now sacrifice Party and put aside selfish\r\nconsiderations is more than half disloyal.  Such a man does not deserve\r\nthe blessings of good government.  Pride of opinion, based upon\r\nSectional jealousies, should not be permitted to control the decision of\r\nany political question.  These remarks are general, but apply with\r\npeculiar force to the People of the Border States at present.\r\n\r\n\"Let us look at our condition.  A desolating War is upon us.  We cannot\r\nescape it if we would.  If the Union Armies were to-day withdrawn from\r\nthe Border States without first crushing the Rebellion in the South, no\r\nrational man can doubt for a moment that the adherents of the Union\r\nCause in those States would soon be driven in exile from their homes by\r\nthe exultant Rebels, who have so long hoped to return and take vengeance\r\nupon us.\r\n\r\n\"The People of the Border States understand very well the unfriendly and\r\nselfish spirit exercised toward them by the leaders of this Cotton-State\r\nRebellion, beginning some time previous to its outbreak.  They will not\r\nfail to remember their insolent refusal to counsel with us, and their\r\nhaughty assumption of responsibility upon themselves for their misguided\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\"Our people will not soon forget that, while declaiming against\r\nCoercion, they closed their doors against the exportation of Slaves from\r\nthe Border States into the South, with the avowed purpose of forcing us\r\ninto Rebellion through fears of losing that species of Property.  They\r\nknew very well the effect to be produced on Slavery by a Civil War,\r\nespecially in those States into which hostile Armies might penetrate,\r\nand upon the soil of which the great contests for the success of\r\nRepublican Government were to be decided.\r\n\r\n\"They wanted some intermediate ground for the conflict of arms-territory\r\nwhere the population would be divided.  They knew, also, that by keeping\r\nSlavery in the Border States the mere 'friction and abrasion' to which\r\nyou so appropriately allude, would keep up a constant irritation,\r\nresulting necessarily from the frequent losses to which the owners would\r\nbe subjected.\r\n\r\n\"They also calculated largely, and not without reason, upon the\r\nrepugnance of Non-Slaveholders in those States to a Free Negro\r\npopulation.  In the meantime they intended persistently to charge the\r\noverthrow of Slavery to be the object of the Government, and hostility\r\nto this Institution the origin of the War.  By this means the\r\nunavoidable incidents of the strife might easily he charged as the\r\nsettled purposes of the Government.\r\n\r\n\"Again, it was well understood, by these men, that exemplary conduct on\r\nthe part of every officer and soldier employed by the Government could\r\nnot in the nature of things be expected, and the hope was entertained,\r\nupon the most reasonable grounds, that every commission of wrong and\r\nevery omission of duty would produce a new cause for excitement and a\r\nnew incentive to Rebellion.\r\n\r\n\"By these means the War was to be kept in the Border States, regardless\r\nof our interests, until an exhausted Treasury should render it necessary\r\nto send the tax-gatherer among our people, to take the little that might\r\nbe left them from the devastations of War.\r\n\r\n\"They then expected a clamor for Peace by us, resulting in the\r\ninterference of France and England, whose operatives in the meantime\r\nwould be driven to want, and whose aristocracy have ever been ready to\r\nwelcome a dissolution of the American Union.\r\n\r\n\"This cunningly-devised plan for securing a Gulf-Confederacy, commanding\r\nthe mouths of the great Western rivers, the Gulf of Mexico, and the\r\nSouthern Atlantic ocean, with their own territory unscathed by the\r\nhorrors of war, and surrounded by the Border States, half of whose\r\npopulation would be left in sympathy with them, for many years to come,\r\nowing to the irritations to which I have alluded, has, so far, succeeded\r\ntoo well.\r\n\r\n\"In Missouri they have already caused us to lose a third or more of the\r\nSlaves owned at the time of the last census.  In addition to this, I can\r\nmake no estimate of the vast amount of property of every character that\r\nhas been destroyed by Military operations in the State.  The loss from\r\ngeneral depreciation of values, and the utter prostration of every\r\nbusiness-interest of our people, is wholly beyond calculation.\r\n\r\n\"The experience of Missouri is but the experience of other Sections of\r\nthe Country similarly situated.  The question is therefore forced upon\r\nus, 'How long is this War to continue; and, if continued, as it has\r\nbeen, on our soil, aided by the Treason and folly of our own citizens,\r\nacting in concert with the Confederates, how long can Slavery, or, if\r\nyou please, any other property-interest, survive in our States?'\r\n\r\n\"As things now are, the people of the Border-States yet divided, we\r\ncannot expect an immediate termination of the struggle, except upon\r\ncondition of Southern Independence, losing thereby control of the lower\r\nMississippi.  For this, we in Missouri are not prepared, nor are we\r\nprepared to become one of the Confederate States, should the terrible\r\ncalamity of Dissolution occur.\r\n\r\n\"This, I presume, the Union men of Missouri would resist to the death.\r\nAnd whether they should do so or not, I will not suppose for an instant,\r\nthat the Government of the United States would, upon any condition,\r\nsubmit to the loss of territory so essential to its future commercial\r\ngreatness as is the State of Missouri.\r\n\r\n\"But should all other reasons fail to prevent such a misfortune to our\r\npeople of Missouri, there is one that cannot fail.  The Confederates\r\nnever wanted us, and would not have us.  I assume, therefore, that the\r\nWar will not cease, but will be continued until the Rebellion shall be\r\novercome.  It cannot and will not cease, so far as the people of\r\nMissouri are concerned, except upon condition of our remaining in the\r\nUnion, and the whole West will demand the entire control of the\r\nMississippi river to the Gulf.\r\n\r\n\"Our interest is therefore bound up with the interests of those States\r\nmaintaining the Union, and especially with the great States of the West\r\nthat must be consulted in regard to the terms of any Peace that may be\r\nsuggested, even by the Nations of Europe, should they at any time\r\nunfortunately depart from their former pacific policy and determine to\r\nintervene in our affairs.\r\n\r\n\"The War, then, will have to be continued until the Union shall be\r\npractically restored.  In this alone consists the future safety of the\r\nBorder-States themselves.  A separation of the Union is ruinous to them.\r\nThe preservation of the Union can only be secured by a continuation of\r\nthe War.  The consequences of that continuation may be judged of by the\r\nexperience of the last twelve months.  The people of my State are as\r\ncompetent to pass judgment in the premises as I am.  I have every\r\nconfidence in their intelligence, their honesty, and their patriotism.\r\n\r\n\"In your own language, the proposition you make 'sets up no claim of a\r\nright by Federal authority to interfere with Slavery within State\r\nlimits,' referring, as it does, the absolute control of the subject in\r\neach case to the State and its people immediately interested.  It is\r\nproposed as a matter of perfectly free choice with them.\r\n\r\n\"In this view of the subject I can frankly say to you that, personally,\r\nI never could appreciate the objections so frequently urged against the\r\nproposition.  If I understood you properly, it was your opinion, not\r\nthat Slavery should be removed in order to secure our loyalty to the\r\nGovernment, for every personal act of your administration precludes such\r\nan inference, but you believe that the peculiar species of Property was\r\nin imminent danger from the War in which we were engaged, and that\r\ncommon justice demanded remuneration for the loss of it.\r\n\r\n\"You then believe, and again express the opinion, that the peculiar\r\nnature of the contest is such that its loss is almost inevitable, and\r\nlest any pretext for a charge of injustice against the Government be\r\ngiven to its enemies, you propose to extend to the people of those\r\nStates standing by the Union, the choice of payment for their Slaves or\r\nthe responsibility of loss, should it occur, without complaint against\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n\"Placing the matter in this light, (a mere remuneration for losses\r\nrendered inevitable by the casualties of War), the objection of a\r\nConstitutional character may be rendered much less formidable in the\r\nminds of Northern Representatives whose constituents will have to share\r\nin the payment of the money; and, so far as the Border States are\r\nconcerned, this objection should be most sparingly urged, for it being a\r\nmatter entirely of their 'own free choice,' in case of a desire to\r\naccept, no serious argument will likely be urged against the receipt of\r\nthe money, or a fund for Colonization.\r\n\r\n\"But, aside from the power derived from the operations of war, there may\r\nbe found numerous precedents in the legislation of the past, such as\r\ngrants of land and money to the several States for specified objects\r\ndeemed worthy by the Federal Congress.  And in addition to this may be\r\ncited a deliberate opinion of Mr. Webster upon this very subject, in one\r\nof the ablest arguments of his life.\r\n\r\n\"I allude to this question of power merely in vindication of the\r\nposition assumed by me in my vote for the Resolution of March last.\r\n\r\n\"In your last communication to us, you beg of us 'to commend this\r\nsubject to the consideration of our States and people.'  While I\r\nentirely differ with you in the opinion expressed, that had the members\r\nfrom the Border States approved of your Resolution of March last 'the\r\nWar would now be substantially ended,' and while I do not regard the\r\nsuggestion 'as one of the most potent and swift means of ending' the\r\nWar, I am yet free to say that I have the most unbounded confidence in\r\nyour sincerity of purpose in calling our attention to the dangers\r\nsurrounding us.\r\n\r\n\"I am satisfied that you appreciate the troubles of the Border States,\r\nand that your suggestions are intended for our good.  I feel the force\r\nof your urgent appeal, and the logic of surrounding circumstances brings\r\nconviction even to an unwilling believer.\r\n\r\n\"Having said that, in my judgment, you attached too much importance to\r\nthis measure as a means for suppressing the Rebellion, it is due to you\r\nthat I shall explain.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be the status of the Border States in this respect, the\r\nWar cannot be ended until the power of the Government is made manifest\r\nin the seceded States.  They appealed to the sword; give them the sword.\r\nThey asked for War; let them see its evils on their own soil.\r\n\r\n\"They have erected a Government, and they force obedience to its\r\nbehests.  This structure must be destroyed; this image, before which an\r\nunwilling People have been compelled to bow, must be broken.  The\r\nauthority of the Federal Government must be felt in the heart of the\r\nrebellious district.  To do this, let armies be marched upon them at\r\nonce, and let them feel what they have inflicted on us in the Border.\r\nDo not fear our States; we will stand by the Government in this work.\r\n\r\n\"I ought not to disguise from you or the people of my State, that\r\npersonally I have fixed and unalterable opinions on the subject of your\r\ncommunication.  Those opinions I shall communicate to the people in that\r\nspirit of frankness that should characterize the intercourse of the\r\nRepresentative with his constituents.\r\n\r\n\"If I were to-day the owner of the lands and Slaves of Missouri, your\r\nproposition, so far as that State is concerned, would be immediately\r\naccepted.  Not a day would be lost.  Aside from public considerations,\r\nwhich you suppose to be involved in the proposition, and which no\r\nPatriot, I agree, should disregard at present, my own personal interest\r\nwould prompt favorable and immediate action.\r\n\r\n\"But having said this, it is proper that I say something more.  The\r\nRepresentative is the servant and not the master of the People.  He has\r\nno authority to bind them to any course of action, or even to indicate\r\nwhat they will, or will not, do when the subject is exclusively theirs\r\nand not his.\r\n\r\n\"I shall take occasion, I hope honestly, to give my views of existing\r\ntroubles and impending dangers, and shall leave the rest to them,\r\ndisposed, as I am, rather to trust their judgment upon the case stated\r\nthan my own, and at the same time most cheerfully to acquiesce in their\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\"For you, personally, Mr. President, I think I can pledge the kindest\r\nconsiderations of the people of Missouri, and I shall not hesitate to\r\nexpress the belief that your recommendation will be considered by them\r\nin the same spirit of kindness manifested by you in its presentation to\r\nus, and that their decision will be such as is demanded 'by their\r\ninterests, their honor, and their duty to the whole Country.'\r\n\r\n\"I am very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                              \"J. B. HENDERSON.\r\n\r\n\"To his Excellency,\r\n\"A. LINCOLN, PRESIDENT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n                       FREEDOM PROCLAIMED TO ALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile mentally revolving the question of Emancipation--now, evidently\r\n\"coming to a head,\"--no inconsiderable portion of Mr. Lincoln's thoughts\r\ncentered upon, and his perplexities grew out of, his assumption that the\r\n\"physical difference\" between the Black and White--the  African and\r\nCaucasian races, precluded the idea of their living together in the one\r\nland as Free men and equals.\r\n\r\nIn his speeches during the great Lincoln-Douglas debate we have seen\r\nthis idea frequently advanced, and so, in his later public utterances as\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nAs in his appeal to the Congressional delegations from the Border-States\r\non the 12th of July, 1862, he had held out to them the hope that \"the\r\nFreed people will not be so reluctant to go\" to his projected colony in\r\nSouth America, when their \"numbers shall be large enough to be company\r\nand encouragement for one another,\" so, at a later date--on the 14th of\r\nAugust following--he appealed to the Colored Free men themselves to help\r\nhim found a proposed Negro colony in New Granada, and thus aid in the\r\nsolution of this part of the knotty problem, by the disenthrallment of\r\nthe new race from its unhappy environments here.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the President's interesting address, at the White\r\nHouse, to the delegation of Colored men, for whom he had sent, was thus\r\nreported at the time:\r\n\r\n\"Having all been seated, the President, after a few preliminary\r\nobservations, informed them that a sum of money had been appropriated by\r\nCongress, and placed at his disposition, for the purpose of aiding the\r\ncolonization in some country of the people, or a portion of them, of\r\nAfrican descent, thereby making it his duty, as it had for a long time\r\nbeen his inclination, to favor that cause; and why, he asked, should the\r\npeople of your race be colonized, and where?\r\n\r\n\"Why should they leave this Country?  This is perhaps the first question\r\nfor proper consideration.  You and we are different races.  We have\r\nbetween us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two\r\nraces.  Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss; but this\r\nphysical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I think.\r\nYour race suffers very greatly, many of them by living among us, while\r\nours suffers from your presence.  In a word we suffer on each side.  If\r\nthis is admitted, it affords a reason, at least, why we should be\r\nseparated.  You here are Freemen, I suppose?\r\n\r\n\"A VOICE--Yes, Sir.\r\n\r\n\"THE PRESIDENT--Perhaps you have long been free, or all your lives.\r\nYour race are suffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on\r\nany people.  But even when you cease to be Slaves, you are yet far\r\nremoved from being placed on an equality with the White race.  You are\r\ncut off from many of the advantages which the other race enjoys.  The\r\naspiration of men is to enjoy equality with the best when free; but on\r\nthis broad continent not a single man of your race is made the equal of\r\na single man of ours.  Go where you are treated the best, and the ban is\r\nstill upon you.  I do not propose to discuss this, but to present it as\r\na fact, with which we have to deal.  I cannot alter it if I would.  It\r\nis a fact about which we all think and feel alike, I and you.  We look\r\nto our condition.\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the existence of the two races on this continent, I need not\r\nrecount to you the effects upon White men, growing out of the\r\ninstitution of Slavery.  I believe in its general evil effects on the\r\nWhite race.  See our present condition--the Country engaged in War!  our\r\nwhite men cutting one another's throats--none knowing how far it will\r\nextend--and then consider what we know to be the truth.  But for your\r\nrace among us there could not be War, although many men engaged on\r\neither side do not care for you one way or the other.  Nevertheless, I\r\nrepeat, without the institution of Slavery, and the Colored race as a\r\nbasis, the War could not have an existence.  It is better for us both,\r\ntherefore, to be separated.\r\n\r\n\"I know that there are Free men among you who, even if they could better\r\ntheir condition, are not as much inclined to go out of the Country as\r\nthose who, being Slaves, could obtain their Freedom on this condition.\r\nI suppose one of the principal difficulties in the way of colonization\r\nis that the free colored man cannot see that his comfort would be\r\nadvanced by it.  You may believe that you can live in Washington, or\r\nelsewhere in the United States, the remainder of your life; perhaps more\r\nso than you can in any foreign country, and hence you may come to the\r\nconclusion that you have nothing to do with the idea of going to a\r\nforeign country.\r\n\r\n\"This is, (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selfish view of the\r\ncase.  But you ought to do something to help those who are not so\r\nfortunate as yourselves.  There is an unwillingness on the part of our\r\nPeople, harsh as it may be, for you free Colored people to remain with\r\nus.  Now if you could give a start to the White people you would open a\r\nwide door for many to be made free.  If we deal with those who are not\r\nfree at the beginning, and whose intellects are clouded by Slavery, we\r\nhave very poor material to start with.\r\n\r\n\"If intelligent Colored men, such as are before me, could move in this\r\nmatter, much might be accomplished.  It is exceedingly important that we\r\nhave men at the beginning capable of thinking as White men, and not\r\nthose who have been systematically oppressed.  There is much to\r\nencourage you.\r\n\r\n\"For the sake of your race you should sacrifice something of your\r\npresent comfort for the purpose of being as grand in that respect as the\r\nWhite people.  It is a cheering thought throughout life, that something\r\ncan be done to ameliorate the condition of those who have been subject\r\nto the hard usages of the World.  It is difficult to make a man\r\nmiserable while he feels he is worthy of himself and claims kindred to\r\nthe great God who made him.\r\n\r\n\"In the American Revolutionary War, sacrifices were made by men engaged\r\nin it, but they were cheered by the future.  General Washington himself\r\nendured greater physical hardships than if he had remained a British\r\nsubject, yet he was a happy man, because he was engaged in benefiting\r\nhis race, in doing something for the children of his neighbors, having\r\nnone of his own.\r\n\r\n\"The Colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time.  In a certain\r\nsense it is a success.  The old President of Liberia, Roberts, has just\r\nbeen with me the first time I ever saw him.  He says they have, within\r\nthe bounds of that Colony, between three and four hundred thousand\r\npeople, or more than in some of our old States, such as Rhode Island, or\r\nDelaware, or in some of our newer States, and less than in some of our\r\nlarger ones.  They are not all American colonists or their descendants.\r\nSomething less than 12,000 have been sent thither from this Country.\r\nMany of the original settlers have died, yet, like people elsewhere,\r\ntheir offspring outnumber those deceased.\r\n\r\n\"The question is, if the Colored people are persuaded to go anywhere,\r\nwhy not there?  One reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of\r\nyou would rather remain within reach of the country of your nativity.  I\r\ndo not know how much attachment you may have toward our race.  It does\r\nnot strike me that you have the greatest reason to love them.  But still\r\nyou are attached to them at all events.\r\n\r\n\"The place I am thinking about having for a colony, is in Central\r\nAmerica.  It is nearer to us than Liberia--not much more than one-fourth\r\nas far as Liberia, and within seven days' run by steamers.  Unlike\r\nLiberia, it is a great line of travel--it is a highway.  The country is\r\na very excellent one for any people, and with great natural resources\r\nand advantages, and especially because of the similarity of climate with\r\nyour native soil, thus being suited to your physical condition.\r\n\r\n\"The particular place I have in view, is to be a great highway from the\r\nAtlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and this particular\r\nplace has all the advantages for a colony.  On both sides there are\r\nharbors among the finest in the World.  Again, there is evidence of very\r\nrich coal mines.  A certain amount of coal is valuable in any country.\r\nWhy I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford an\r\nopportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get\r\nready to settle permanently in their homes.\r\n\r\n\"If you take colonists where there is no good landing, there is a bad\r\nshow; and so, where there is nothing to cultivate, and of which to make\r\na farm.  But if something is started so that you can get your daily\r\nbread as soon as you reach there, it is a great advantage.  Coal land is\r\nthe best thing I know of, with which to commence an enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"To return--you have been talked to upon this subject, and told that a\r\nspeculation is intended by gentlemen who have an interest in the\r\ncountry, including the coal mines.  We have been mistaken all our\r\nlives if we do not know Whites, as well as Blacks, look to their\r\nself-interest.  Unless among those deficient of intellect, everybody you\r\ntrade with makes something.  You meet with these things here and\r\neverywhere.  If such persons have what will be an advantage to them, the\r\nquestion is, whether it cannot be made of advantage to you?\r\n\r\n\"You are intelligent, and know that success does not as much depend on\r\nexternal help, as on self-reliance.  Much, therefore, depends upon\r\nyourselves.  As to the coal mines, I think I see the means available for\r\nyour self-reliance.  I shall, if I get a sufficient number of you\r\nengaged, have provision made that you shall not be wronged.  If you will\r\nengage in the enterprise, I will spend some of the money intrusted to\r\nme.  I am not sure you will succeed.  The Government may lose the money,\r\nbut we cannot succeed unless we try; but we think, with care, we can\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n\"The political affairs in Central America are not in quite as\r\nsatisfactory condition as I wish.  There are contending factions in that\r\nquarter; but it is true, all the factions are agreed alike on the\r\nsubject of colonization, and want it; and are more generous than we are\r\nhere.  To your Colored race they have no objection.  Besides, I would\r\nendeavor to have you made equals, and have the best assurance that you\r\nshould be the equals of the best.\r\n\r\n\"The practical thing I want to ascertain is, whether I can get a number\r\nof able-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to\r\ngo, when I present evidence of encouragement and protection.  Could I\r\nget a hundred tolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children,\r\nand able to 'cut their own fodder' so to speak?  Can I have fifty?  If I\r\ncould find twenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and\r\nchildren--good things in the family relation, I think I could make a\r\nsuccessful commencement.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to let me know whether this can be done or not.  This is the\r\npractical part of my wish to see you.  These are subjects of very great\r\nimportance--worthy of a month's study, of a speech delivered in an hour.\r\nI ask you, then, to consider seriously, not as pertaining to yourselves\r\nmerely, nor for your race, and ours, for the present time, but as one of\r\nthe things, if successfully managed, for the good of mankind--not\r\nconfined to the present generation, but as:\r\n\r\n              \"From age to age descends the lay\r\n               To millions yet to be,\r\n               Till far its echoes roll away\r\n               Into eternity.\"'\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln's well-meant colored colonization project, however,\r\nfell through, owing partly to opposition to it in Central America, and\r\npartly to the very natural and deeply-rooted disinclination of the\r\nColored free men to leave the land of their birth.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, limited Military Emancipation of Slaves was announced and\r\nregulated, on the 22d July, 1862, by the following Executive\r\nInstructions, which were issued from the War Department by order of the\r\nPresident--the issue of which was assigned by Jefferson Davis as one\r\nreason for his Order of August 1, 1862, directing \"that the commissioned\r\nofficers of Pope's and Steinwehr's commands be not entitled, when\r\ncaptured, to be treated as soldiers and entitled to the benefit of the\r\ncartel of exchange:\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\"WASHINGTON, D.C., July 22, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"First.  Ordered that Military Commanders within the States of Virginia,\r\nNorth Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,\r\nTexas, and Arkansas, in an orderly manner seize and use any property,\r\nreal or personal, which may be necessary or convenient for their several\r\ncommands, for supplies, or for other Military purposes; and that while\r\nproperty may be destroyed for proper Military objects, none shall be\r\ndestroyed in wantonness or malice.\r\n\r\n\"Second.  That Military and Naval Commanders shall employ as laborers,\r\nwithin and from said States, so many Persons of African descent as can\r\nbe advantageously used for Military or Naval purposes, giving them\r\nreasonable wages for their labor.\r\n\r\n\"Third.  That, as to both property, and Persons of African descent,\r\naccounts shall be kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show\r\nquantities and amounts, and from whom both property and such Persons\r\nshall have come, as a basis upon which compensation can be made in\r\nproper cases; and the several departments of this Government shall\r\nattend to and perform their appropriate parts towards the execution of\r\nthese orders.\r\n\r\n\"By Order of the President:\r\n\r\n                         \"EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n                         \"Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of August, 1862, Major General McClellan promulgated the\r\nExecutive Order of July 22, 1862, from his Headquarters at Harrison's\r\nLanding, Va., with certain directions of his own, among which were the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"Inhabitants, especially women and children, remaining peaceably at\r\ntheir homes, must not be molested; and wherever commanding officers find\r\nfamilies peculiarly exposed in their persons or property to marauding\r\nfrom this Army, they will, as heretofore, so far as they can do with\r\nsafety and without detriment to the service, post guards for their\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\"In protecting private property, no reference is intended to Persons\r\nheld to service or labor by reason of African Descent.  Such Persons\r\nwill be regarded by this Army, as they heretofore have been, as\r\noccupying simply a peculiar legal status under State laws, which\r\ncondition the Military authorities of the United States are not required\r\nto regard at all in districts where Military operations are made\r\nnecessary by the rebellious action of the State governments.\r\n\r\n\"Persons subject to suspicion of hostile purposes, residing or being\r\nnear our Forces, will be, as heretofore, subject to arrest and\r\ndetention, until the cause or necessity is removed.  All such arrested\r\nparties will be sent, as usual, to the Provost-Marshal General, with a\r\nstatement of the facts in each case.\r\n\r\n\"The General Commanding takes this occasion to remind the officers and\r\nsoldiers of this Army that we are engaged in supporting the Constitution\r\nand the Laws of the United States and suppressing Rebellion against\r\ntheir authority; that we are not engaged in a War of rapine, revenge, or\r\nsubjugation; that this is not a contest against populations, but against\r\narmed forces and political organizations; that it is a struggle carried\r\non with the United States, and should be conducted by us upon the\r\nhighest principles known to Christian civilization.\r\n\r\n\"Since this Army commenced active operations, Persons of African\r\ndescent, including those held to service or labor under State laws, have\r\nalways been received, protected, and employed as laborers at wages.\r\nHereafter it shall be the duty of the Provost-Marshal General to cause\r\nlists to be made of all persons of African descent employed in this Army\r\nas laborers for Military purposes--such lists being made sufficiently\r\naccurate and in detail to show from whom such persons shall have come.\r\n\r\n\"Persons so subject and so employed have always understood that after\r\nbeing received into the Military service of the United States, in any\r\ncapacity, they could never be reclaimed by their former holders.  Except\r\nupon such understanding on their part, the order of the President, as to\r\nthis class of Persons, would be inoperative.  The General Commanding\r\ntherefore feels authorized to declare to all such employees, that they\r\nwill receive permanent Military protection against any compulsory return\r\nto a condition of servitude.\"\r\n\r\nPublic opinion was now rapidly advancing, under the pressure of Military\r\nnecessity, and the energetic efforts of the immediate Emancipationists,\r\nto a belief that Emancipation by Presidential Proclamation would be wise\r\nand efficacious as an instrumentality toward subduing the Rebellion;\r\nthat it must come, sooner or later--and the sooner, the better.\r\n\r\nIndeed, great fault was found, by some of these, with what they\r\ncharacterized as President Lincoln's \"obstinate slowness\" to come up to\r\ntheir advanced ideas on the subject.  He was even accused of failing to\r\nexecute existing laws touching confiscation of Slaves of Rebels coming\r\nwithin the lines of the Union Armies.  On the 19th of August, 1862, a\r\nletter was addressed to him by Horace Greeley which concluded thus:\r\n\r\n\"On the face of this wide Earth, Mr. President, there is not one\r\ndisinterested, determined, intelligent champion of the Union Cause who\r\ndoes not feel that all attempts to put down the Rebellion, and at the\r\nsame time uphold its inciting cause, are preposterous and futile--that\r\nthe Rebellion, if crushed out to-morrow, would be renewed within a year\r\nif Slavery were left in full vigor--that Army officers, who remain to\r\nthis day devoted to Slavery, can at best be but half-way loyal to the\r\nUnion--and that every hour of deference to Slavery is an hour of added\r\nand deepened peril to the Union.\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to the testimony of your embassadors in Europe.  It is freely\r\nat your service, not mine.  Ask them to tell you candidly whether\r\nthe seeming subserviency of your policy to the Slaveholding,\r\nSlavery-upholding interest, is not the perplexity, the despair,\r\nof Statesmen of all parties; and be admonished by the general answer.\r\n\r\n\"I close, as I began, with the statement that what an immense majority\r\nof the loyal millions of your countrymen require of you, is a frank,\r\ndeclared, unqualified, ungrudging execution of the Laws of the Land,\r\nmore especially of the Confiscation Act.  That Act gives Freedom to the\r\nSlaves of Rebels coming within our lines, or whom those lines may at any\r\ntime inclose.  We ask you to render it due obedience by publicly\r\nrequiring all your subordinates to recognize and obey it.\r\n\r\n\"The Rebels are everywhere using the late Anti-Negro riots in the North\r\n--as they have long used your officers' treatment of Negroes in the\r\nSouth--to convince the Slaves that they have nothing to hope from a\r\nUnion success--that we mean in that case to sell them into a bitter\r\nBondage to defray the cost of the War.\r\n\r\n\"Let them impress this as a truth on the great mass of their ignorant\r\nand credulous Bondmen, and the Union will never be restored--never.  We\r\ncan not conquer ten millions of people united in solid phalanx against\r\nus, powerfully aided by Northern sympathizers and European allies.\r\n\r\n\"We must have scouts, guides, spies, cooks, teamsters, diggers, and\r\nchoppers, from the Blacks of the South--whether we allow them to fight\r\nfor us or not--or we shall be baffled and repelled.\r\n\r\n\"As one of the Millions who would gladly have avoided this struggle, at\r\nany sacrifice but that of principle and honor, but who now feel that the\r\ntriumph of the Union is indispensable not only to the existence of our\r\nCountry, but to the well-being of mankind, I entreat you to render a\r\nhearty and unequivocal obedience to the Law of the Land.\r\n                         \"Yours,\r\n                              \"HORACE GREELEY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this letter, President Lincoln at once made the following memorable\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n                         \"EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n               \"WASHINGTON, Friday, August 22, 1862.\r\n\r\n\"HON.

I would save the Union.  I would save it in\r\nthe shortest way under the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"The sooner the National authority can be restored, the nearer the Union\r\nwill be--the Union as it was.\r\n\r\n\"If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the\r\nsame time save Slavery, I do not agree with them.\r\n\r\n\"If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the\r\nsame time destroy Slavery, I do not agree, with them.\r\n\r\n\"My paramount object is to save the Union and not either to save or\r\ndestroy Slavery.\r\n\r\n\"If I could save the Union without freeing any Slave, I would do it--and\r\nif I could save it by freeing all the Slaves, I would do it--and if I\r\ncould save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"What I do about Slavery and the Colored race, I do because I believe it\r\nhelps to save the Union, and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not\r\nbelieve it would help to save the Union.\r\n\r\n\"I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the\r\ncause, and shall do more whenever I believe doing more will help the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\"I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors, and I shall\r\nadopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.\r\n\r\n\"I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty,\r\nand I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all\r\nmen everywhere could be free.\r\n                         \"Yours,\r\n                                   \"A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of September, 1862, a deputation from all the religious\r\ndenominations of Chicago presented to President Lincoln a memorial for\r\nthe immediate issue of a Proclamation of Emancipation, to which, and the\r\nChairman's remarks, he thus replied:\r\n\r\n\"The subject presented in the Memorial is one upon which I have thought\r\nmuch for weeks past, and I may even say, for months.  I am approached\r\nwith the most opposite opinions, and advice, and that by religious men,\r\nwho are equally certain that they represent the Divine will.  I am sure\r\nthat either the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief, and\r\nperhaps, in some respects, both.  I hope it will not be irreverent for\r\nme to say that if it is probable that God would reveal His will to\r\nothers, on a point so connected with my duty, it might be supposed He\r\nwould reveal it directly to me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself\r\nthan I often am, it is my earnest desire to know the will of Providence\r\nin this matter.  And if I can learn what it is, I will do it!\r\n\r\n\"These are not, however, the days of miracles, and I suppose it will be\r\ngranted that I am not to expect a direct Revelation; I must study the\r\nplain physical aspects of the case, ascertain what is possible, and\r\nlearn what appears to be wise and right!\r\n\r\n\"The subject is difficult, and good men do not agree.  For instance, the\r\nother day, four gentlemen, of standing and intelligence, from New York,\r\ncalled, as a delegation, on business connected with the War; but, before\r\nleaving, two of them earnestly besought me to proclaim general\r\nEmancipation, upon which the other two at once attacked them.\r\n\r\n\"You know also that the last Session of Congress had a decided majority\r\nof Anti-Slavery men, yet they could not unite on this policy.  And the\r\nsame is true of the religious people; why the Rebel soldiers are praying\r\nwith a great deal more earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and\r\nexpecting God to favor their side; for one of our soldiers, who had been\r\ntaken prisoner, told Senator Wilson, a few days since, that he met\r\nnothing so discouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among\r\nin their prayers.  But we will talk over the merits of the case.\r\n\r\n\"What good would a Proclamation of Emancipation from me do, especially\r\nas we are now situated?  I do not want to issue a document that the\r\nwhole World will see must necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope's\r\nBull against the Comet!  Would my word free the Slaves, when I cannot\r\neven enforce the Constitution in the Rebel States?  Is there a single\r\nCourt or Magistrate, or individual that would be influenced by it there?\r\nAnd what reason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon\r\nthe Slaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved and which\r\noffers protection and Freedom to the Slaves of Rebel masters who came\r\nwithin our lines?  Yet I cannot learn that that law has caused a single\r\nSlave to come over to us.\r\n\r\n\"And suppose they could be induced by a Proclamation of Freedom from me\r\nto throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them?  How can we\r\nfeed and care for such a multitude?  General Butler wrote me a few days\r\nsince that he was issuing more rations to the Slaves who have rushed to\r\nhim, than to all the White troops under his command.  They eat, and that\r\nis all; though it is true General Butler is feeding the Whites also, by\r\nthe thousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there.\r\n\r\n\"If, now, the pressure of the War should call off our forces from New\r\nOrleans to defend some other point, what is to prevent the masters from\r\nreducing the Blacks to Slavery again; for I am told that whenever the\r\nRebels take any Black prisoners, Free or Slave, they immediately auction\r\nthem off!  They did so with those they took from a boat that was aground\r\nin the Tennessee river a few days ago.\r\n\r\n\"And then I am very ungenerously attacked for it!  For instance, when,\r\nafter the late battles at and near Bull Run, an expedition went out from\r\nWashington, under a flag of truce, to bury the dead and bring in the\r\nwounded, and the Rebels seized the Blacks who went along to help, and\r\nsent them into Slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the\r\nGovernment would probably do nothing about it.  What could I do?\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would\r\nfollow the issuing of such a Proclamation as you desire?  Understand, I\r\nraise no objections against it on legal or Constitutional grounds, for,\r\nas Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, in time of War, I suppose I\r\nhave a right to take any measure which may best subdue the Enemy, nor do\r\nI urge objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of\r\ninsurrection and massacre at the South.  I view this matter as a\r\npractical War measure, to be decided on according to the advantages or\r\ndisadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the Rebellion.\r\n\r\n                *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"I admit that Slavery is at the root of the Rebellion, or, at least, its\r\nsine qua non.  The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to\r\nact, but they would have been impotent without Slavery as their\r\ninstrument.  I will also concede that Emancipation would help us in\r\nEurope, and convince them that we are incited by something more than\r\nambition.  I grant, further, that it would help somewhat at the North,\r\nthough not so much, I fear, as you and those you represent imagine.\r\n\r\n\"Still, some additional strength would be added in that way to the War,\r\nand then, unquestionably, it would weaken the Rebels by drawing off\r\ntheir laborers, which is of great importance; but I am not so sure we\r\ncould do much with the Blacks.  If we were to arm them, I fear that in\r\na few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the Rebels; and, indeed,\r\nthus far, we have not had arms enough to equip our White troops.\r\n\r\n\"I will mention another thing, though it meet only your scorn and\r\ncontempt.  There are 50,000 bayonets in the Union Army from the Border\r\nSlave States.  It would be a serious matter if, in consequence of a\r\nProclamation such as you desire, they should go over to the Rebels.  I\r\ndo not think they all would--not so many, indeed, as a year ago, or as\r\nsix months ago--not so many to-day, as yesterday.  Every day increases\r\ntheir Union feeling.  They are also getting their pride enlisted, and\r\nwant to beat the Rebels.\r\n\r\n\"Let me say one thing more: I think you should admit that we already\r\nhave an important principle to rally and unite the People, in the fact\r\nthat Constitutional Government is at stake.  This is a fundamental idea\r\ngoing down about as deep as anything!\r\n\r\n               *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n\"Do not misunderstand me because I have mentioned these objections.\r\nThey indicate the difficulties that have thus far prevented my action in\r\nsome such way as you desire.\r\n\r\n\"I have not decided against a Proclamation of Liberty to the Slaves, but\r\nhold the matter under advisement.  And I can assure you that the subject\r\nis on my mind, by day and night, more than any other.  Whatever shall\r\nappear to be God's will I will do.\r\n\r\n\"I trust that in the freedom with which I have canvassed your views I\r\nhave not in any respect injured your feelings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 22d day of September, 1862, not only the Nation, but the whole\r\nWorld, was electrified by the publication--close upon the heels of the\r\nUnion victory of Antietam--of the Proclamation of Emancipation--weighted\r\nwith consequences so wide and far-reaching that even at this late day\r\nthey cannot all be discerned.  It was in these words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States of America, and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, do hereby proclaim and\r\ndeclare that hereafter, as heretofore, the War will be prosecuted for\r\nthe object of practically restoring the Constitutional relation between\r\nthe United States and each of the States and the people thereof, in\r\nwhich States that relation is or may be suspended or disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"That it is my purpose, upon the next meeting of Congress, to again\r\nrecommend the adoption of a practical measure tendering pecuniary aid to\r\nthe free acceptance or rejection of all Slave States, so called, the\r\npeople whereof may not then be in Rebellion against the United States,\r\nand which States may then have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may\r\nvoluntarily adopt, immediate or gradual abolishment of Slavery within\r\ntheir respective limits; and that the effort to colonize Persons of\r\nAfrican descent with their consent upon this continent or elsewhere,\r\nwith the previously obtained consent of the Governments existing there,\r\nwill be continued.\r\n\r\n\"That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand\r\neight hundred and sixty-three, all Persons held as Slaves within any\r\nState or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in\r\nRebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and\r\nforever Free; and the Executive Government of the United States,\r\nincluding the Military and Naval authority thereof, will recognize and\r\nmaintain the Freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to\r\nrepress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for\r\ntheir actual Freedom.\r\n\r\n\"That the Executive will, on the first day of January aforesaid, by\r\nProclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which\r\nthe people thereof respectively, shall then be in Rebellion against the\r\nUnited States; and the fact that any State, or the people thereof, shall\r\non that day be, in good faith, represented in the Congress of the United\r\nStates by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the\r\nqualified voters of such States shall have participated, shall, in the\r\nabsence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive\r\nevidence that such State, and the people thereof, are not in Rebellion\r\nagainst the United States.\r\n\r\n\"That attention is hereby called to an Act of Congress entitled 'An Act\r\nto make an additional Article of War,' approved March 31, 1862, and\r\nwhich Act is in the words and figures following:\r\n\r\n\"'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America in Congress assembled, That hereafter the following\r\nshall be promulgated as an additional Article of War, for the government\r\nof the Army of the United States, and shall be obeyed and observed as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\n\"ARTICLE--All officers or persons in the Military or Naval service of\r\nthe United States are prohibited from employing any of the forces under\r\ntheir respective commands for the purpose of returning Fugitives from\r\nservice or labor who may have escaped from any persons to whom such\r\nservice or labor is claimed to be due, and any officer who shall be\r\nfound guilty by a court-martial of violating this article shall be\r\ndismissed from the service.\r\n\r\n\"'SECTION 2.--And be it further enacted, That this Act shall take effect\r\nfrom and after its passage.'\r\n\r\n\"Also to the ninth and tenth sections of an Act entitled 'An Act to\r\nsuppress Insurrection, to punish Treason and Rebellion, to seize and\r\nconfiscate property of Rebels, and for other purposes,' approved July\r\n17, 1862, and which sections are in the words and figures following:\r\n\r\n\"'SEC. 9.--And be it further enacted, That all Slaves of persons who\r\nshall hereafter be engaged in Rebellion against the Government of the\r\nUnited States or who shall in any way give aid or comfort thereto,\r\nescaping from such persons and taking refuge within the lines of the\r\nArmy; and all Slaves captured from such persons or deserted by them, and\r\ncoming under the control of the Government of the United States; and all\r\nSlaves of such persons found on [or] being within any place occupied by\r\nRebel forces and afterward occupied by the forces of the United States,\r\nshall be deemed captives of war, and shall be forever Free of their\r\nservitude, and not again held as Slaves.\r\n\r\n\"'SEC. 10.--And be it further enacted, That no Slave escaping into any\r\nState, Territory, or the District of Columbia, from any other State,\r\nshall be delivered up, or in any way impeded or hindered of his liberty,\r\nexcept for crime, or some offense against the laws, unless the person\r\nclaiming said Fugitive shall first make oath that the person to whom the\r\nlabor or service of such Fugitive is alleged to be due is his lawful\r\nowner, and has not borne arms against the United States in the present\r\nRebellion, nor in any way given aid and comfort thereto; and no person\r\nengaged in the Military or Naval service of the United States shall,\r\nunder any pretense whatever, assume to decide on the validity of the\r\nclaim of any person to the service or labor of any other person, or\r\nsurrender up any such Person to the claimant, on pain of being dismissed\r\nfrom the service.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons engaged in the\r\nMilitary and Naval service of the United States to observe, obey, and\r\nenforce, within their respective spheres of service, the Act and\r\nsections above recited.\r\n\r\n\"And the Executive will in due time recommend that all\r\ncitizens of the United States who shall have remained loyal thereto\r\nthroughout the Rebellion shall (upon the restoration of the\r\nConstitutional relation between the United States and their respective\r\nStates and people, if that relation shall have been suspended or\r\ndisturbed) be compensated for all losses by acts of the United States,\r\nincluding the loss of Slaves.\r\n\r\n\"In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed.\r\n\r\n\"Done at the city of Washington this twenty-second day of September, in\r\nthe year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States the eighty-seventh.\r\n\r\n\"By the President:\r\n\"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n\"WILLIAM H.  SEWARD, Secretary of State.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Proclamation, promising Freedom to an Enslaved race, was hailed\r\nwith acclamations everywhere save in the rebellious Southern-Slave\r\nStates, and in the Border-Slave States.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of Governors of Loyal States, held at Altoona,\r\nPennsylvania, to take measures for the more active support of the\r\nGovernment, an Address was adopted, on the very day that the\r\nProclamation was promulgated, which well expressed the general feeling\r\nprevailing throughout the Northern States, at this time.  It was in\r\nthese patriotic words:\r\n\r\n\"After nearly one year and a half spent in contest with an armed and\r\ngigantic Rebellion against the National Government of the United States,\r\nthe duty and purpose of the Loyal States and people continue, and must\r\nalways remain as they were at its origin--namely to restore and\r\nperpetuate the authority of this Government and the life of the Nation.\r\nNo matter what consequences are involved in our fidelity, this work of\r\nrestoring the Republic, preserving the institutions of democratic\r\nLiberty, and justifying the hopes and toils of our Fathers, shall not\r\nfail to be performed.\r\n\r\n\"And we pledge, without hesitation, to the President of the United\r\nStates, the most loyal and cordial support, hereto as heretofore, in\r\nthe exercise of the functions of his great office.  We recognize in him\r\nthe chief Executive magistrate of the Nation, the Commander-in-Chief of\r\nthe Army and Navy of the United States, their responsible and\r\nconstitutional head, whose rightful authority and power, as well as the\r\nConstitutional powers of Congress, must be rigorously and religiously\r\nguarded and preserved, as the condition on which alone our form of\r\nGovernment and the constitutional rights and liberties of the People\r\nthemselves can be saved from the wreck of anarchy or from the gulf\r\n'despotism.\r\n\r\n\"In submission to the laws which may have been or which may be duly\r\nenacted, and to the lawful orders of the President, cooperating always\r\nin our own spheres with the National Government, we mean to continue in\r\nthe most rigorous exercise of all our lawful and proper powers,\r\ncontending against Treason, Rebellion, and the public Enemies, and,\r\nwhether in public life or in private station, supporting the arms of the\r\nUnion, until its Cause shall conquer, until final victory shall perch\r\nupon its standard, or the Rebel foe will yield a dutiful, rightful, and\r\nunconditional submission.  And, impressed with the conviction that an\r\nArmy of reserve ought, until the War shall end, to be constantly kept on\r\nfoot, to be raised, armed, equipped, and trained at home, and ready for\r\nemergencies, we respectfully ask the President to call such a force of\r\nvolunteers for one year's service, of not less than one hundred thousand\r\nin the aggregate, the quota of each State to be raised after it shall\r\nhave led its quota of the requisitions already made, both for volunteers\r\nand militia.  We believe that this would be a Leasure of Military\r\nprudence, while it would greatly promote the Military education of the\r\nPeople.\r\n\r\n\"We hail with heartfelt gratitude and encouraged hope the Proclamation\r\nof the President, issued on the 22nd instant, declaring Emancipated from\r\ntheir bondage all Persons held to Service or Labor as Slaves in the\r\nRebel States, whose Rebellion shall last until the first day of January\r\nnext ensuing.\r\n\r\n\"The right of any person to retain authority to compel any portion of\r\nthe subjects of the National Government to rebel against it, or to\r\nmaintain its Enemies, implies in those who are allowed possession of\r\nsuch authority the right to rebel themselves; and therefore, the right\r\nto establish Martial Law or Military Government in a State or Territory\r\nin Rebellion implies the right and the duty of the Government to\r\nliberate the minds of all men living therein by appropriate\r\nProclamations and assurances of protection, in order that all who are\r\ncapable, intellectually and morally, of loyalty and obedience, may not\r\nbe forced into Treason as the unwilling tools of rebellious Traitors.\r\n\r\n\"To have continued indefinitely the most efficient cause, support, and\r\nstay of the Rebellion, would have been, in our judgment, unjust to the\r\nLoyal people whose treasure and lives are made a willing sacrifice on\r\nthe altar of patriotism--would have discriminated against the wife who\r\nis compelled to surrender her husband, against the parent who is to\r\nsurrender his child, to the hardships of the camp and the perils of\r\nbattle, in favor of Rebel masters permitted to retain their Slaves.  It\r\nwould have been a final decision alike against humanity, justice, the\r\nrights and dignity of the Government, and against sound and wise\r\nNational policy.\r\n\r\n\"The decision of the President to strike at the root of the Rebellion\r\nwill lend new vigor to efforts, and new life and hope to the hearts of\r\nthe People.  Cordially tendering to the President our respectful\r\nassurances of personal and official confidence, we trust and believe\r\nthat the policy now inaugurated will be crowned with success, will give\r\nspeedy and triumphant victories over our enemies, and secure to this\r\nNation and this People the blessing and favor of Almighty God.\r\n\r\n\"We believe that the blood of the heroes who have already fallen, and\r\nthose who may yet give their lives to their Country, will not have been\r\nshed in vain.\r\n\r\n\"The splendid valor of our soldiers, their patient endurance, their\r\nmanly patriotism, and their devotion to duty, demand from us and from\r\nall their countrymen the homage of the sincerest gratitude and the\r\npledge of our constant reinforcement and support.  A just regard for\r\nthese brave men, whom we have contributed to place in the field, and for\r\nthe importance of the duties which may lawfully pertain to us hereafter,\r\nhas called us into friendly conference.\r\n\r\n\"And now, presenting to our National Chief Magistrate this conclusion of\r\nour deliberations, we devote ourselves to our Country's service, and we\r\nwill surround the President with our constant support, trusting that the\r\nfidelity and zeal of the Loyal States and People will always assure him\r\nthat he will be constantly maintained in pursuing, with the utmost\r\nvigor, this War for the preservation of the National life and hope of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n\"A.

SPRAGUE,\r\n\"F. H. PEIRPOINT,\r\n\"DAVID TOD,\r\n\"N. S. BERRY,\r\n\"AUSTIN BLAIR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome two months after the issue of his great Proclamation of Liberty,\r\nPresident Lincoln (in his Second Annual Message to Congress, December 1,\r\n1862), took occasion again to refer to compensated Emancipation, and,\r\nindeed, to the entire matter of Slavery and Freedom, in most instructive\r\nand convincing manner, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"On the 22d day of September last, a Proclamation was issued by the\r\nExecutive, a copy of which is herewith  submitted.\r\n\r\n\"In accordance with the purpose in the second paragraph of that paper, I\r\nnow respectfully recall your attention to what may be called\r\n'compensated Emancipation.'\r\n\r\n\"A Nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its\r\nlaws.  The territory is the only part which is of certain durability.\r\n'One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh, but the\r\nEarth abideth forever.'  It is of the first importance to duly consider\r\nand estimate this ever-enduring part.\r\n\r\n\"That portion of the Earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the\r\nPeople of the United States, is well adapted to be the home of one\r\nNational family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more.  Its vast\r\nextent, and its variety of climate and productions, are of advantage, in\r\nthis age, for one People, whatever they might have been in former ages.\r\nSteam, telegraphs, and intelligence, have brought these to be an\r\nadvantageous combination for one united People.\r\n\r\n\"In the Inaugural Address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of\r\nDisunion, as a remedy for the differences between the people of the two\r\nSections.  I did so in language which I cannot improve, and which,\r\ntherefore, I beg to repeat:\r\n\r\n\"'One Section of our Country believes Slavery is right, and ought to be\r\nextended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be\r\nextended.  This is the only substantial dispute.  The Fugitive Slave\r\nclause of the Constitution, and the law for the suppression of the\r\nforeign Slave Trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can\r\never be in a community where the moral sense of the People imperfectly\r\nsupports the law itself.\r\n\r\n\"The great body of the People abide by the dry legal obligation in both\r\ncases, and a few break over in each.  This, I think, cannot be perfectly\r\ncured; and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the\r\nSections, than before.  The foreign Slave Trade, now imperfectly\r\nsuppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one\r\nSection; while Fugitive Slaves, now only partially surrendered, would\r\nnot be surrendered at all by the other.\r\n\r\n\"Physically speaking, we cannot separate.  We cannot remove our\r\nrespective Sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall\r\nbetween them.  A husband and wife may be divorced, and each go out of\r\nthe presence and beyond the reach of the other; but the different parts\r\nof our Country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain face to face; and\r\nintercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them.\r\n\r\n\"'Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or\r\nmore satisfactory after separation than before?  Can aliens make\r\ntreaties easier than friends can make laws?  Can treaties be more\r\nfaithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? suppose\r\nyou go to War, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss on\r\nboth sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old\r\nquestions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you.'\r\n\r\n\"There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a National boundary\r\nupon which to divide.  Trace through, from East to West, upon the line\r\nbetween the Free and Slave Country, and we shall find a little more than\r\none third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated,\r\nor soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its\r\nremaining length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk\r\nback and forth without any consciousness of their presence.\r\n\r\n\"No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass, by writing\r\nit down on paper or parchment as a National boundary.  The fact of\r\nseparation, if it comes, gives up, on the part of the seceding Section,\r\nthe Fugitive Slave clause, along with all other Constitutional\r\nobligations upon the Section seceded from, while I should expect no\r\ntreaty stipulations would ever be made to take its place.\r\n\r\n\"But there is another difficulty.  The great interior region, bounded\r\nEast by the Alleghanies, North by the British dominions, West by the\r\nRocky Mountains, and South by the line along which the culture of corn\r\nand cotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of\r\nTennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin,\r\nIllinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, and the Territories of\r\nDakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above ten million\r\npeople, and will have fifty millions within fifty years, if not\r\nprevented by any political folly or mistake.\r\n\r\n\"It contains more than one-third of the country owned by the United\r\nStates-certainly more than one million square miles.  Once half as\r\npopulous as Massachusetts already is, it would have more than\r\nseventy-five million people.  A glance at the map shows that,\r\nterritorially speaking, it is the great body of the Republic.  The other\r\nparts are but marginal borders to it, the magnificent region sloping\r\nWest, from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, being the deepest and\r\nalso the richest in undeveloped resources.  In the production of\r\nprovisions, grains, grasses, and all which proceed from them, this great\r\ninterior region is naturally one of the most important in the World.\r\n\r\n\"Ascertain from the statistics the small proportion of the region which\r\nhas, as yet, been brought into cultivation, and also the large and\r\nrapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed\r\nwith the magnitude of the prospect presented.  And yet this region has\r\nno sea coast, touches no ocean anywhere.  As part of one Nation, its\r\npeople now find, and may forever find, their way to Europe by New York,\r\nto South America and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\n\"But separate our common Country into two nations, as designed by the\r\npresent Rebellion, and every man of this great interior region is\r\nthereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets, not, perhaps, by\r\na physical barrier, but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations.\r\n\r\n\"And this is true, wherever a dividing or boundary line may be fixed.\r\nPlace it between the now Free and Slave country, or place it South of\r\nKentucky, or North of Ohio, and still the truth remains, that none South\r\nof it can trade to any port or place North of it, and none North of it\r\ncan trade to any port or place South of it except upon terms dictated by\r\na Government foreign to them.\r\n\r\n\"These outlets, East, West, and South, are indispensable to the\r\nwell-being of the people inhabiting, and to inhabit, this vast interior\r\nregion.  Which of the three may be the best, is no proper question.\r\nAll, are better than either; and all, of right belong to that People,\r\nand to their successors forever.  True to themselves, they will not ask\r\nwhere a line of separation shall be, but will vow rather that there\r\nshall be no such line.\r\n\r\n\"Nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to\r\nand through them, to the great outside World.  They too, and each of\r\nthem, must have access to this Egypt of the West without paying toll at\r\nthe crossing of any National boundary.\r\n\r\n\"Our National strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the\r\nLand we inhabit; not from our National homestead.  There is no possible\r\nsevering of this, but would multiply, and not mitigate, evils among us.\r\nIn all its adaptations and aptitudes it demands Union, and abhors\r\nseparation.  In fact it would, ere long, force reunion, however much of\r\nblood and treasure the separation might have cost.\r\n\r\n\"Our strife pertains to ourselves--to the passing generations of men;\r\nand it can, without convulsion, be hushed forever--with the passing of\r\none generation.\r\n\r\n\"In this view I recommend the adoption of the following Resolution and\r\nArticles Amendatory of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"'Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates of America, in Congress assembled, (two-thirds of both Houses\r\nconcurring).  That the following Articles be proposed to the\r\nLegislatures (or Conventions) of the several States, as Amendments to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States, all or any of which Articles when\r\nratified by three-fourths of the said Legislatures (or Conventions) to\r\nbe valid as part or parts of the said Constitution, namely:\r\n\r\n\"'ARTICLE--Every State wherein Slavery now exists, which shall abolish\r\nthe same therein, at any time, or times, before the first day of\r\nJanuary, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred, shall\r\nreceive compensation from the United States, as follows, to wit;\r\n\r\n\"'The President of the United States shall deliver to every such State,\r\nbonds of the United States, bearing interest at the rate of per cent.\r\nper annum, to an amount equal to the aggregate sum of for each Slave\r\nshown to have been therein by the eighth census of the United States,\r\nsaid bonds to be delivered to such States by installments, or in one\r\nparcel, at the completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same\r\nshall have been gradual, or at one time, within such State; and interest\r\nshall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its\r\ndelivery as aforesaid.  Any State having received bonds as aforesaid,\r\nand afterward reintroducing or tolerating Slavery therein, shall refund\r\nto the United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and\r\nall interest paid thereon.\r\n\r\n\"'ARTICLE--All Slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the\r\nchances of the War at any time before the end of the Rebellion, shall be\r\nforever Free; but all owners of such, who shall not have been disloyal,\r\nshall be compensated for them, at the same rates as is provided for\r\nStates adopting abolishment of Slavery, but in such way that no Slave\r\nshall be twice accounted for.\r\n\r\n\"'ARTICLE--Congress may appropriate money, and otherwise provide for\r\ncolonizing Free Colored Persons, with their own consent, at any place or\r\nplaces within the United States.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I beg indulgence to discuss these proposed Articles at some length.\r\nWithout Slavery the Rebellion could never have existed; without Slavery\r\nit could not continue.\r\n\r\n\"Among the friends of the Union there is great diversity of sentiment\r\nand of policy in regard to Slavery, and the African race among us.  Some\r\nwould perpetuate Slavery; some would abolish it suddenly, without\r\ncompensation; some would abolish it gradually, and with compensation;\r\nsome would remove the Freed people from us; and some would retain them\r\nwith us; and there are yet other minor diversities.  Because of these\r\ndiversities, we waste much strength in struggles among ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"By mutual Concession we should harmonize and act together.  This would\r\nbe Compromise; but it would be Compromise among the friends, and not\r\nwith the enemies of the Union.  These Articles are intended to embody a\r\nplan of such mutual concessions.  If the plan shall be adopted, it is\r\nassumed that Emancipation will follow, at least, in several of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\"As to the first Article, the main points are: first, the Emancipation;\r\nsecondly, the length of time for consummating it--thirty-seven years;\r\nand, thirdly, the compensation.\r\n\r\n\"The Emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual\r\nSlavery; but the length of time should greatly mitigate their\r\ndissatisfaction.  The time spares both races from the evils of sudden\r\nderangement--in fact from the necessity of any derangement--while most\r\nof those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the\r\nmeasure will have passed away before its consummation.  They will never\r\nsee it.\r\n\r\n\"Another class will hail the prospect of Emancipation, but will\r\ndeprecate the length of time.  They will feel that it gives too little\r\nto the now living Slaves.  But it really gives them much.  It saves them\r\nfrom the vagrant destitution which must largely attend immediate\r\nEmancipation in localities where their numbers are very great; and it\r\ngives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be Free\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\"The plan leaves to each State, choosing to act under it, to abolish\r\nSlavery now, or at the end of the century, or at any intermediate time,\r\nor by degrees, extending over the whole or any part of the period; and\r\nit obliges no two States to proceed alike.  It also provides for\r\ncompensation,--and generally, the mode of making it.  This, it would\r\nseem, must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor\r\nperpetual Slavery, and especially of those who are to receive the\r\ncompensation.  Doubtless some of those who are to pay, and not to\r\nreceive, will object.  Yet the measure is both just and economical.\r\n\r\n\"In a certain sense, the liberation of Slaves is the destruction of\r\nProperty--Property acquired by descent, or by purchase, the same as any\r\nother property.  It is no less true for having been often said, that the\r\npeople of the South are not more responsible for the original\r\nintroduction of this Property than are the people of the North; and when\r\nit is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar, and\r\nshare the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say\r\nthat the South has been more responsible than the North for its\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\n\"If, then, for a common object, this Property is to be sacrificed, is it\r\nnot just that it be done at a common charge?\r\n\r\n\"And if, with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the\r\nbenefits of the Union by this means than we can by the War alone, is it\r\nnot also economical to do it?  Let us consider it then.  Let us\r\nascertain the sum we have expended in the War since compensated\r\nEmancipation was proposed last March, and consider whether, if that\r\nmeasure had been promptly accepted, by even some of the Slave States,\r\nthe same sum would not have done more to close the War than has been\r\notherwise done.  If so, the measure would save money, and, in that view,\r\nwould be a prudent and economical measure.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing;\r\nbut it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one.  And\r\nit is easier to pay any sum when we are able, than it is to pay it\r\nbefore we are able.  The War requires large sums, and requires them at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\"The aggregate sum necessary for compensated Emancipation of course\r\nwould be large.  But it would require no ready cash, nor the bonds,\r\neven, any faster than the Emancipation progresses.  This might not, and\r\nprobably would not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years.  At\r\nthat time we shall probably have a hundred million people to share the\r\nburden, instead of thirty-one millions, as now.  And not only so, but\r\nthe increase of our population may be expected to continue, for a long\r\ntime after that period, as rapidly as before; because our territory will\r\nnot have become full.\r\n\r\n\"I do not state this inconsiderately.  At the same ratio of increase\r\nwhich we have maintained, on an average, from our first National census\r\nin 1790, until that of 1860, we should, in 1900, have a population of\r\n103,208,415.  And why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that\r\nperiod?\r\n\r\n\"Our abundant room--our broad National homestead--is our ample resource.\r\nWere our territory as limited as are the British Isles, very certainly\r\nour population could not expand as stated.  Instead of receiving the\r\nforeign born, as now, we should be compelled to send part of the\r\nNative-born away.\r\n\r\n\"But such is not our condition.  We have two million nine hundred and\r\nsixty-three thousand square miles.  Europe has three million and eight\r\nhundred thousand, with a population averaging seventy-three and\r\none-third persons to the square mile.  Why may not our Country at some\r\ntime, average as many?  Is it less fertile?  Has it more waste surface\r\nby mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other causes?  Is it inferior\r\nto Europe in any natural advantage?\r\n\r\n\"If, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe, how soon?\r\nAs to when this may be, we can judge by the past and the present; as to\r\nwhen it will be, if ever, depends much on whether we maintain the Union.\r\n\r\n\"Several of our States are already above the average of Europe\r\n--seventy-three and a third to the square mile.  Massachusetts has 157;\r\nRhode Island, 133; Connecticut, 99; New York and New Jersey, each, 80.\r\nAlso two other great States, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are not far below,\r\nthe former having 63, and the latter 59.  The States already above the\r\nEuropean average, except New York, have increased in as rapid a ratio,\r\nsince passing that point, as ever before; while no one of them is equal\r\nto some other parts of our Country in natural capacity for sustaining a\r\ndense population.\r\n\r\n\"Taking the Nation in the aggregate, and we find its population and\r\nratio of increase, for the several decennial periods, to be as follows:\r\n\r\nYEAR.  POPULATION. RATIO OF INCREASE\r\n\r\n1790   3,929,827\r\n\r\n1800   5,305,937   35.02 Per Cent.\r\n\r\n1810   7,239,814   36.45\r\n\r\n1820   9,638,131   33.13\r\n\r\n1830  12,866,020   33.49\r\n\r\n1840  17,069,453   32.67\r\n\r\n1850  23,191,876   35.87\r\n\r\n1860  31,443,790   35.58\r\n\r\n\"This shows an average Decennial Increase of 34.69 per cent. in\r\npopulation through the seventy years from our first to our last census\r\nyet taken.  It is seen that the ratio of increase, at no one of these\r\nseven periods, is either two per cent. below or two per cent. above the\r\naverage; thus showing how inflexible, and, consequently, how reliable,\r\nthe law of Increase, in our case, is.\r\n\r\n\"Assuming that it will continue, gives the following results:\r\n\r\nYEAR.  POPULATION.\r\n\r\n1870   42,323,041\r\n\r\n1880   56,967,216\r\n\r\n1890   76,677,872\r\n\r\n1900  103,208,415\r\n\r\n1910  138,918,526\r\n\r\n1920  186,984,335\r\n\r\n1930  251,680,914\r\n\r\n\"These figures show that our Country may be as populous as Europe now is\r\nat some point between 1920 and 1930--say about 1925--our territory, at\r\nseventy-three and a third persons to the square mile, being of capacity\r\nto contain 217,186,000.\r\n\r\n\"And we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the\r\nchance by the folly and evils of Disunion or by long and exhausting War\r\nspringing from the only great element of National discord among us.\r\nWhile it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of\r\nSecession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population,\r\ncivilization and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it\r\nwould be very great and injurious.\r\n\r\n\"The proposed Emancipation would shorten the War, perpetuate Peace,\r\ninsure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of\r\nthe Country.  With these, we should pay all the Emancipation would cost,\r\ntogether with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\n\"If we had allowed our old National debt to run at six per cent. per\r\nannum, simple interest, from the end of our Revolutionary Struggle until\r\nto-day, without paying anything on either principal or interest, each\r\nman of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon it\r\nthen; and this because our increase of men through the whole period has\r\nbeen greater than six per cent.; has run faster than the interest upon\r\nthe debt.  Thus, time alone, relieves a debtor Nation, so long as its\r\npopulation increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\n\"This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly\r\ndue, but it shows the great importance of time in this connection--the\r\ngreat advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we\r\nnumber a hundred millions, what, by a different policy, we would have to\r\npay now, when we number but thirty-one millions.  In a word, it shows\r\nthat a dollar will be much harder to pay for the War, than will be a\r\ndollar for Emancipation on the proposed plan.  And then the latter will\r\ncost no blood, no precious life.  It will be a saving of both.\r\n\r\n\"As to the Second Article, I think it would be impracticable to return\r\nto Bondage the class of Persons therein contemplated.  Some of them,\r\ndoubtless, in the property sense, belong to loyal owners and hence\r\nprovision is made in this Article for compensating such.\r\n\r\n\"The Third Article relates to the future of the Freed people.  It does\r\nnot oblige, but merely authorizes, Congress to aid in colonizing such as\r\nmay consent.  This ought not to be regarded as objectionable on the one\r\nhand or on the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing, unless by the\r\nmutual consent of the people to be deported, and the American voters,\r\nthrough their Representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot make it better known than it already is, that I strongly favor\r\ncolonization.  And yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against\r\nfree Colored persons remaining in the Country which is largely\r\nimaginary, if not sometimes malicious.\r\n\r\n\"It is insisted that their presence would injure and displace White\r\nlabor and White laborers.  If there ever could be a proper time for mere\r\ncatch arguments, that time surely is not now.  In times like the present\r\nmen should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be\r\nresponsible through Time and in Eternity.\r\n\r\n\"Is it true, then, that Colored people can displace any more White labor\r\nby being Free, than by remaining Slaves?  If they stay in their old\r\nplaces, they jostle no White laborers; if they leave their old places,\r\nthey leave them open to White laborers.  Logically, there is neither\r\nmore nor less of it.\r\n\r\n\"Emancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance the\r\nwages of White labor, and, very surely would not reduce them.  Thus, the\r\ncustomary amount of labor would still have to be performed; the freed\r\npeople would surely not do more than their old proportion of it and,\r\nvery probably, for a time would do less, leaving an increased part to\r\nWhite laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and\r\nconsequently enhancing the wages of it.\r\n\r\n\"With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to White\r\nlabor is mathematically certain.  Labor is like any other commodity in\r\nthe market-increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it.\r\nReduce the supply of Black labor by colonizing the Black laborer out of\r\nthe Country, and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and\r\nwages of White labor.\r\n\r\n\"But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the\r\nwhole Land!  Are they not already in the Land?  Will liberation make\r\nthem any more numerous?  Equally distributed among the Whites of the\r\nwhole Country, there would be but one Colored, in seven Whites.  Could\r\nthe one, in any way, greatly disturb the seven?\r\n\r\n\"There are many communities now, having more than one free Colored\r\nperson to seven Whites; and this, without any apparent consciousness of\r\nevil from it.  The District of Columbia, and the States of Maryland and\r\nDelaware, are all in this condition.  The District has more than one\r\nfree Colored to six Whites; and yet, in its frequent petitions to\r\nCongress I believe it has never presented the presence of free Colored\r\npersons as one of its grievances.\r\n\r\n\"But why should Emancipation South, send the freed people North? people\r\nof any color, seldom run, unless there be something to run from.\r\nHeretofore, Colored people, to some extent, have fled North from\r\nbondage, and now, perhaps, from both bondage and destitution.  But if\r\ngradual Emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neither\r\nto flee from.\r\n\r\n\"Their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can\r\nbe procured; and the freed men, in turn, will gladly give their labor\r\nfor the wages, till new homes can be found for them, in congenial\r\nclimes, and with people of their own blood and race.\r\n\r\n\"This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved.  And,\r\nin any event, cannot the North decide for itself, whether to receive\r\nthem?\r\n\r\n\"Again, as practice proves more than theory, in any case, has there been\r\nany irruption of Colored people Northward because of the abolishment of\r\nSlavery in this District last Spring?  What I have said of the\r\nproportion of free Colored persons to the Whites in the District is from\r\nthe census of 1860, having no reference to persons called Contrabands,\r\nnor to those made free by the Act of Congress abolishing Slavery here.\r\n\r\n\"The plan consisting of these Articles is recommended, not but that a\r\nrestoration of the National authority would be accepted without its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\n\"Nor will the War, nor proceedings under the Proclamation of September\r\n22, 1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan.  Its\r\ntimely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\"And, notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress\r\nprovides by law for compensating any State which may adopt Emancipation\r\nbefore this plan shall have been acted upon, is hereby earnestly\r\nrenewed.  Such would be only an advance part of the plan, and the same\r\narguments apply to both.\r\n\r\n\"This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but\r\nadditional to, all others, for restoring and preserving the National\r\nauthority throughout the Union.  The subject is presented exclusively in\r\nits economical aspect.\r\n\r\n\"The plan would, I am confident, secure Peace more speedily, and\r\nmaintain it more permanently, than can be done by force alone; while all\r\nit would cost, considering amounts, and manner of payment, and times of\r\npayment, would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the\r\nWar, if we rely solely upon force.  It is much, very much, that it would\r\ncost no blood at all.\r\n\r\n\"The plan is proposed as permanent Constitutional Law.  It cannot become\r\nsuch without the concurrence of, first, two-thirds of Congress, and\r\nafterward, three-fourths of the Slave States.  The requisite\r\nthree-fourths of the States will necessarily include seven of the Slave\r\nStates.  Their concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their\r\nseverally adopting Emancipation at no very distant day upon the new\r\nConstitutional terms.  This assurance would end the struggle now and\r\nsave the Union forever.\r\n\r\n\"I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed\r\nto the Congress of the Nation by the Chief Magistrate of the Nation.\r\nNor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you\r\nhave more experience than I in the conduct of public affairs.  Yet I\r\ntrust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me, you will\r\nperceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may\r\nseem to display.\r\n\r\n\"Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten\r\nthe War, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood?  Is it\r\ndoubted that it would restore the National authority and National\r\nprosperity, and perpetuate both indefinitely?  Is it doubted that we\r\nhere--Congress and Executive--can secure its adoption; will not the good\r\npeople respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?  Can we, can\r\nthey, by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital\r\nobjects; we can succeed only by concert.\r\n\r\n\"It is not, 'Can any of us imagine better?' but,'Can we all do better?'\r\nObject whatsoever is possible, still the question recurs, 'Can we do\r\nbetter?  The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy\r\npresent.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise\r\nwith the occasion.  As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act\r\nanew.  We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\n\"Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history.  We, of this Congress and\r\nthis Administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves.  No\r\npersonal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of\r\nus.  The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor\r\nor dishonor, to the latest generation.\r\n\r\n\"We say we are for the Union.  The World will not forget that we say\r\nthis.  We know how to save the Union.\r\n\r\n\"The World knows we do know how to save it.  We even we here--hold the\r\npower, and bear the responsibility.\r\n\r\n\"In giving Freedom to the Slave, we assure Freedom to the Free-Honorable\r\nalike in what we give and what we preserve.  We shall nobly save, or\r\nmeanly lose, the last, best hope of Earth.  Other means may succeed;\r\nthis could not fail.  The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way\r\nwhich, if followed, the World would forever applaud, and God must\r\nforever bless.\r\n\r\n                              \"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe popular Branch of Congress responded with heartiness to what Mr.\r\nLincoln had done.  On December 11, 1862, resolutions were offered by Mr.\r\nYeaman in the House of Representatives, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate Concurring), That\r\nthe Proclamation of the President of the United States, of date the 22d\r\nof September, 1862, is not warranted by the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the policy of Emancipation as indicated in that\r\nProclamation, is not calculated to hasten the restoration of Peace, was\r\nnot well chosen as a War measure, and is an assumption of power\r\ndangerous to the rights of citizens and to the perpetuity of a Free\r\nPeople.\"\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were laid on the table by 95 yeas to 47 nays--the yeas\r\nall Republicans, save three, and the nays all Democrats save five.\r\n\r\nOn December 15, 1862, Mr. S. C. Fessenden, of Maine, offered resolutions\r\nto the House, in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Proclamation of the President of the United States,\r\nof the date of 22d September, 1862, is warranted by the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the policy of Emancipation, as indicated in that\r\nProclamation, is well adapted to hasten the restoration of Peace, was\r\nwell chosen as a War measure, and is an exercise of power with proper\r\nregard for the rights of the States, and the perpetuity of Free\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were adopted by 78 yeas to 52 nays--the yeas all\r\nRepublicans, save two, and the nays all Democrats, save seven.\r\n\r\nThe Proclamation of September 22d, 1862, was very generally endorsed and\r\nupheld by the People at large; and, in accordance with its promise, it\r\nwas followed at the appointed time, January 1st, 1863, by the\r\nsupplemental Proclamation specifically Emancipating the Slaves in the\r\nrebellious parts of the United States--in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"WHEREAS, On the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord\r\none thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a Proclamation was issued by\r\nthe President of the United States, containing, among other things, the\r\nfollowing, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"'That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand\r\neight hundred and sixty-three, all Persons held as Slaves within any\r\nState, or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be\r\nin Rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward,\r\nand forever Free;

It seemed as though they considered the most\r\nsacred promises and covenants of no account, and made only to be\r\ntrampled upon, when in the way of their Moloch.\r\n\r\nWe remember the bitter Slavery agitation in Congress over the admission\r\nof the State of Missouri, and how it eventuated in the Missouri\r\nCompromise.  That compromise, we have seen, they afterward trod upon,\r\nand broke, with as little compunction as they would have stepped upon\r\nand crushed a toad.\r\n\r\nThey felt their own growing power, and gloried in their strength and\r\narrogance; and Northern timidity became a scoff and by-word in their\r\nmouths.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that from its very conception, as well as birth, they hated\r\nand opposed the Union, because they disliked a Republican and preferred\r\na Monarchical form of Government.  Their very inability to prevent the\r\nconsummation of that Union, imbittered them.  Hence their determination\r\nto seize every possible occasion and pretext afterward to destroy it,\r\nbelieving, as they doubtless did, that upon the crumbled and mouldering\r\nruins of a dissevered Union and ruptured Republic, Monarchical ideas\r\nmight the more easily take root and grow.  But experience had already\r\ntaught them that it would be long before their real object could even be\r\ncovertly hinted at, and that in the meantime it must be kept out of\r\nsight by the agitation of other political issues.  The formulation and\r\npromulgation therefore, by Jefferson, in the Kentucky Resolutions of\r\n1798, and by Madison, in the Virginia Resolutions of 1799, of the\r\ndoctrine of States Rights already referred to, was a perfect \"God-send\"\r\nto these men.  For it not only enabled them to keep from public view and\r\nknowledge their ultimate aim and purpose, but constituted the whip which\r\nthey thenceforth everlastingly flourished and cracked over the shrinking\r\nheads of other and more patriotic people--the whip with which, through\r\nthe litter of their broken promises, they ruthlessly rode into, and, for\r\nso long a period of years held on to, supreme power and place in the\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nIncluding within the scope of States Rights, the threats of\r\nNullification, Disunion and Secession--ideas abhorrent to the Patriot's\r\nmind--small wonder is it that, in those days, every fresh demand made by\r\nthese political autocrats was tremblingly acceded to, until patience and\r\nconcession almost utterly exhausted themselves.\r\n\r\nOriginally disturbing only South Carolina and Georgia to any extent,\r\nthese ambitious men, who believed in anything rather than a Republic,\r\nand who were determined to destroy the Union, gradually spread the\r\nspirit of jealousy and discontent into other States of the South; their\r\nimmediate object being to bring the Southern States into the closest\r\npossible relations the one with the other; to inspire them all with\r\ncommon sympathies and purposes; to compact and solidify them, so that in\r\nall coming movements against the other States of the Union, they might\r\nmove with proportionately increased power, and force, and effect,\r\nbecause of such unity of aim and strength.\r\n\r\nThis spirit of Southern discontent, and jealousy of the Northern States,\r\nwas, as we have seen, artfully fanned by the Conspirators, in heated\r\ndiscussions over the Tariff Acts of 1824, and 1828, and 1832, until, by\r\nthe latter date, the people of the Cotton-States were almost frantic,\r\nand ready to fight over their imaginary grievances.  Then it was that\r\nthe Conspirators thought the time had come, for which they had so long\r\nand so earnestly prayed and worked, when the cotton Sampson should wind\r\nhis strong arms around the pillars of the Constitution and pull down the\r\ngreat Temple of our Union--that they might rear upon its site another\r\nand a stronger edifice, dedicated not to Freedom, but to Free-Trade and\r\nto other false gods.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina was to lead off, and the other Cotton States would\r\nfollow.  South Carolina did lead off--but the other Cotton-States did\r\nnot follow.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in these pages how South Carolina declared the Tariff\r\nActs aforesaid, null and void, armed herself to resist force, and\r\ndeclared that any attempt of the general Government to enforce those\r\nActs would cause her to withdraw from the Union.  But Jackson as we know\r\nthrottled the treason with so firm a grip that Nullification and\r\nSecession and Disunion were at once paralyzed.\r\n\r\nThe concessions to the domineering South, in Clay's Compromise Tariff of\r\n1833, let the Conspirators down easily, so to speak; and they pretended\r\nto be satisfied.  But they were satisfied only as are the thirsty sands\r\nof Africa with the passing shower.\r\n\r\nThe Conspirators had, however, after all, made substantial gains.  They\r\nhad established a precedent for an attempt to secede.  That was\r\nsomething.  They had demonstrated that a single Southern State could\r\nstand up, armed and threatening, strutting, blustering, and bullying,\r\nand at least make faces at the general Government without suffering any\r\nvery dreadful consequences.  That was still more.\r\n\r\nThey had also ascertained that, by adopting such a course, a single\r\nSouthern State could force concessions from the fears of the rest of the\r\nUnited States.  That was worth knowing, because the time might come,\r\nwhen it might be desirable not only for one but for all the Southern\r\nStates to secede upon some other pretext, and when it would be awkward,\r\nand would interfere with the Disunion programme, to have the other\r\nStates either offer or make concessions.\r\n\r\nThey had also learned the valuable lesson that the single issue of\r\nFree-Trade was not sufficiently strong of itself to unite all the\r\nSouthern States in a determination to secede, and thus dissolve the\r\nUnion.  They saw they must agitate some other issue to unify the South\r\nmore thoroughly and justify Disunion.  On looking over the whole field\r\nthey concluded that the Slavery question would best answer their\r\npurpose, and they adopted it.\r\n\r\nIt was doubtless a full knowledge of the fact that they had adopted it,\r\nthat led Jackson to make the declaration, heretofore in these pages\r\ngiven, which has been termed \"prophetic.\"  At any rate, thenceforth the\r\nprogramme of the Conspirators was to agitate the Slavery question in all\r\nways possible, so as to increase, extend and solidify the influence and\r\nstrength of the Slave power; strain the bonds uniting them with the Free\r\nStates; and weaken the Free States by dividing them upon the question.\r\nAt the same time the Free-Trade question was to be pressed forward to a\r\ntriumphal issue, so that the South might be enriched and strengthened,\r\nand the North impoverished and weakened, by the result.\r\n\r\nThat was their programme, in the rough, and it was relentlessly adhered\r\nto.  Free-Trade and Slavery by turns, if not together, from that time\r\nonward, were ever at the front, agitating our People both North and\r\nSouth, and not only consolidating the Southern States on those lines, as\r\nthe Conspirators designed, but also serving ultimately to consolidate,\r\nto some extent--in a manner quite unlooked for by the Conspirators\r\n--Northern sentiment, on the opposite lines of Protection and Freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Compromise Tariff Act of 1833--which Clay was weak enough to\r\nconcede, and even stout old Jackson to permit to become law without his\r\nsignature--gave to the Conspirators great joy for years afterward, as\r\nthey witnessed the distress and disaster brought by it to Northern homes\r\nand incomes--not distress and disaster alone, but absolute and\r\napparently irreparable ruin.\r\n\r\nThe reaction occasioned by this widespread ruin having brought the Whigs\r\ninto power, led to the enactment of the Protective-Tariff of 1842 and\r\n--to the chagrin of the Conspirators--industrial prosperity and plenty to\r\nthe Free North again ensued.\r\n\r\nEven as Cain hated his brother Abel because his sacrifices were\r\nacceptable in the sight of God, while his own were not, so the Southern\r\nConspirators, and other Slave-owners also, had, by this time, come to\r\nhate the Northern free-thinking, free-acting, freedom-loving mechanic\r\nand laboring man, because the very fact and existence of his Godgiven\r\nFreedom and higher-resulting civilization was a powerful and perpetual\r\nprotest against the--abounding iniquities and degradations of Slavery as\r\npracticed by themselves.\r\n\r\nHence, by trickery, by cajoling the People With his, and their own,\r\nassurances that he was in favor of Protection--they secured the election\r\nin 1844 of a Free-Trade President, the consequent repeal of the\r\nProtective-Tariff of 1842--which had repaired the dreadful mischief\r\nwrought by the Compromise Act of 1833--and the enactment of the infamous\r\nFree-Trade Tariff of 1846, which blasted the manufacturing and farming\r\nand trade industries of the Country again, as with fire.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the great gold fields of California, and the enormous\r\namount of the precious metal poured by her for many succeeding years\r\ninto the lap of the Nation, alone averted what otherwise would\r\ninevitably have been total ruin.  As it was, in 1860, the National\r\ncredit had sunk to a lower point than ever before in all its history.\r\nIt was confessedly bankrupt, and ruin stalked abroad throughout the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nBut while, with rapid pen, the carrying out of that part of the Southern\r\nConspirators' Disunion programme which related to Free-Trade, is thus\r\nbrought again to mind, the other part of that programme, which related\r\nto Slavery, must not be neglected or overlooked.  On this question they\r\nhad determined, as we have seen, to agitate without ceasing--having in\r\nview, primarily, as already hinted, the extension of Slave territory and\r\nthe resulting increase of Slave power in the Land; and, ulteriorly, the\r\nsolidifying of that power, and Disunion of the Republic, with a view to\r\nits conversion into an Oligarchy, if not a Monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of the struggle over the admission of Missouri as a Slave\r\nState in 1820, under the Missouri Compromise, was to be revived by the\r\nConspirators, at the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\nAccordingly in 1836--only three years after the failure of Nullification\r\nin South Carolina, the Territory, of Arkansas was forced in as a Slave\r\nState, and simultaneously the Slave-owning henchmen of the Conspirators,\r\npreviously settled there for the purpose, proclaimed the secession from\r\nMexico, and independence, of Texas.  This was quickly followed, in 1844,\r\nby Calhoun's hastily negotiated treaty of annexation with Texas; its\r\nmiscarriage in the Senate; and the Act of March 2, 1845--with its sham\r\ncompromise--consenting to the admission of Texas to the Union of States.\r\n\r\nThen came the War with Mexico; the attempt by means of the Wilmot\r\nproviso to check the growing territorial-greed and rapacity of the\r\nSlave-power; and the acquisition by the United States, of California and\r\nNew Mexico, under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which brought\r\nPeace.\r\n\r\nThen occurred the agitation over the organization of  Territorial\r\ngovernments for Oregon, California, and New Mexico, and the strong\r\neffort to extend to the Pacific Ocean the Missouri-Compromise line of\r\n36  30', and to extend to all future Territorial organizations the\r\nprinciples of that compromise.\r\n\r\nThen came the struggle in 1850, over the admission of California as a\r\nState, and New Mexico and Utah to Territorial organization--ending in\r\nthe passage of Clay's Compromise measures of 1850.\r\n\r\nYet still the Southern Conspirators--whose forces, both in Congress and\r\nout, were now well-disciplined, compacted, solidified, experienced, and\r\nbigotedly enthusiastic and overbearing--were not satisfied.  It was not\r\ntheir intention to be satisfied with anything less than the destruction\r\nof the Union and of our Republican form of Government.  The trouble was\r\nonly beginning, and, so far, almost everything had progressed to their\r\nliking.  The work must proceed.\r\n\r\nIn 1852-3 they commenced the Kansas-Nebraska agitation; and, what with\r\ntheir incessant political and colonizing movements in those Territories;\r\nthe frequent and dreadful atrocities committed by their tools, the\r\nBorder-ruffians; the incessant turmoil created by cruelties to their\r\nFugitive-slaves; their persistent efforts to change the Supreme Court to\r\ntheir notions; these-with the decision and opinion of the Supreme Court\r\nin the Dred Scott case--together worked the Slavery question up to a\r\ndangerous degree of heat, by the year 1858.\r\n\r\nAnd, by 1860--when the people of the Free States, grown sick unto death\r\nof the rule of the Slave-power in the General Government, arose in their\r\npolitical might, and shook off this \"Old Man of the Sea,\" electing,\r\nbeyond cavil and by the Constitutional mode, to the Presidential office,\r\na man who thoroughly represented in himself their conscience, on the one\r\nhand, which instinctively revolted against human Slavery as a wrong\r\ncommitted against the laws of God, and their sense of justice and equity\r\non the other, which would not lightly overlook, or interfere with vested\r\nrights under the Constitution and the laws of man--the Conspirators had\r\nreached the point at which they had been aiming ever since that failure\r\nin 1832 of their first attempt at Disunion, in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThey had now succeeded in irritating both the Free and the Slave-holding\r\nSections of our Country against each other, to an almost unbearable\r\npoint; had solidified the Southern States on the Slavery and Free-Trade\r\nquestions; and at last--the machinations of these same Conspirators\r\nhaving resulted in a split in the Democratic Party, and the election of\r\nthe Republican candidate to the Presidency, as the embodiment of the\r\npreponderating National belief in Freedom and equality to all before the\r\nLaw, with Protection to both Labor and Capital--they also had the\r\npretext for which they had both been praying and scheming and preparing\r\nall those long, long years--they, and some of their fathers before them.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too often repeated that to secure a Monarchy, or at least\r\nan Oligarchy, over which the leading Conspirators should rule for life\r\n--whether that Monarchy or that Oligarchy should comprise the States of\r\nthe South by themselves, or all the States on a new basis of Union--was\r\nthe great ultimate aim of the Conspirators; and this could be secured\r\nonly by first disrupting the then existing Republican Union of\r\nRepublican States.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the right of Secession had now long been taught, and had\r\nbecome a part of the Southern Slave-holders' Democratic creed, as fully\r\nas had the desirability of Slavery and Free-Trade--and even many of the\r\nNorthern Democrats, and some Republicans as well, were not much inclined\r\nto dispute, although they cared not to canvass, the point.\r\n\r\nThe programme of action was therefore much the same as had been laid\r\ndown in the first attempt in 1832:--first South Carolina would secede\r\nand declare her independence; then the other Slave States in quick\r\nsuccession would do likewise; then a new Constitution for a solid\r\nSouthern Union; then, if necessary, a brief War to cement it--which\r\nwould end, of course, in the independence of the South at least, but\r\nmore probably in the utter subjugation and humiliation of the Free\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWhen the time should come, during or after this War--as come, in their\r\nbelief, it would--for a change in the form of Government, then they\r\ncould seize the first favorable occasion and change it.  At present,\r\nhowever, the cry must be for \"independence.\"  That accomplished, the\r\nrest would be easy.  And until that independence was accomplished, no\r\nterms of any sort, no settlement of any kind, were either to be proposed\r\nor accepted by them.\r\n\r\nThese were their dreams, their ambitions, their plans; and the tenacious\r\ncourage with which they stuck to them \"through thick and thin,\" through\r\nvictory and disaster, were worthy of a better cause.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the pretexts for Secession were \"Slavery\" and\r\n\"Free-Trade\"--both of which were alleged to be jeopardized in the\r\nelection and inauguration of Abraham Lincoln--yet, no sooner had\r\nhostilities commenced between the seceding States and the Union, than\r\nthey declared to the World that their fight was not for Slavery, but for\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nThey dared not acknowledge to the World that they fought for Slavery,\r\nlest the sympathies of the World should be against them.  But it was\r\nwell understood by the Southern masses, as well as the other people of\r\nthe Union, that both Slavery and Free-Trade were involved in the fight\r\n--as much as independence, and the consequent downfall of the Union.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln, however, had made up his mind to do all he properly\r\ncould to placate the South.  None knew better than he, the history of\r\nthis Secession movement, as herein described.  None knew better than he,\r\nthe fell purpose and spirit of the Conspirators.  Yet still, his kindly\r\nheart refused to believe that the madness of the Southern leaders was so\r\nfrenzied, and their hatred of Free men, Free labor, and Free\r\ninstitutions, so implacable, that they would wilfully refuse to listen\r\nto reason and ever insist on absolutely inadmissible terms of\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of his Administration, he did all that was\r\npossible to mollify their resentment and calm their real or pretended\r\nfears.  Nor was this from any dread or doubt as to what the outcome of\r\nan armed Conflict would be; for, in his speech at Cincinnati, in the\r\nAutumn of 1859, he had said, while addressing himself to Kentuckians and\r\nother Southern men: \"Why, gentlemen, I think you are as gallant and as\r\nbrave men as live; that you can fight as bravely in a good cause, man\r\nfor man, as any other people living; that you have shown yourselves\r\ncapable of this upon various occasions; but man for man, you are not\r\nbetter than we are, and there are not so many of you as there are of us.\r\nYou will never make much of a hand at whipping us.  If we were fewer in\r\nnumbers than you, I think that you could whip us; if we were equal it\r\nwould likely be a drawn battle; but being inferior in numbers, you will\r\nmake nothing by attempting to master us.\"\r\n\r\nAnd early in 1860, in his famous New York Cooper Institute speech he had\r\nsaid \"Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let\r\nus, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.\"  He plainly\r\nbelieved to the end, that \"right makes might;\" and he believed in the\r\npower of numbers--as also did Napoleon, if we may judge from his famous\r\ndeclaration that \"The God of battles is always on the side of the\r\nheaviest battalions.\"  Yet, so believing, President Lincoln exerted\r\nhimself in all possible ways to mollify the South. His assurances,\r\nhowever, were far from satisfying the Conspirators.  They never had been\r\nsatisfied with anything in the shape of concession.  They never would\r\nbe.  They had been dissatisfied with and had broken all the compacts and\r\ncompromises, and had spit upon all the concessions, of the past; and\r\nnothing would now satisfy them, short of the impossible.\r\n\r\nThey were not satisfied now with Lincoln's promise that the Government\r\nwould not assail them--organized as, by this time, they were into a\r\nso-called Southern \"Confederacy\" of States--and they proceeded accordingly\r\nto assail that Government which would not assail them.  They opened fire\r\non Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\nThis was done, as has duly appeared, in the hope that the shedding of\r\nblood would not only draw the States of the Southern Confederacy more\r\nclosely together in their common cause, and prevent the return of any of\r\nthem to their old allegiance, but also to so influence the wavering\r\nallegiance to the Union, of the Border States, as to strengthen that\r\nConfederacy and equivalently weaken that Union, by their Secession.\r\n\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas, of the Border States\r\nthat were wavering, were thus gathered into the Confederate fold, by\r\nthis policy of blood-spilling--carried bodily thither, by a desperate\r\nand frenzied minority, against the wishes of a patriotic majority.\r\n\r\nVirginia, especially, was a great accession to the Rebel cause.  She\r\nbrought to it the prestige of her great name.  To secure the active\r\ncooperation of \"staid old Virginia,\" \"the Mother of Statesmen,\" in the\r\nstruggle, was, in the estimation of the Rebels, an assurance of victory\r\nto their cause.  And the Secession of Virginia for a time had a\r\ndepressing influence upon the friends of the Union everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of West Virginia to go with the rest of the State into\r\nRebellion, was, to be sure, some consolation; and the checkmating of the\r\nConspirators' designs to secure to the Confederacy the States of\r\nMaryland, Kentucky and Missouri, helped the confidence of Union men.  In\r\nfact, as long as the National Capital was secure, it was felt that the\r\nUnion was still safe.\r\n\r\nBut while the Confederacy, by the firing upon Fort Sumter, and thus\r\nassailing that Government which Lincoln had promised would not assail\r\nthe Rebels, had gained much in securing the aid of the States mentioned,\r\nyet the Union Cause, by that very act, had gained more.  For the echoes\r\nof the Rebel guns of Fort Moultrie were the signal for such an uprising\r\nof the Patriots of the North and West and Middle States, as, for the\r\nmoment, struck awe to the hearts of Traitors and inspired with courage\r\nand hopefulness the hearts of Union men throughout the Land.\r\n\r\nMoreover it put the Rebels in their proper attitude, in the eyes of the\r\nWorld--as the first aggressors--and thus deprived them, to a certain\r\nextent, of that moral support from the outside which flows from\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nThose echoes were the signal, not only of that call to arms which led to\r\nsuch an uprising, but for the simultaneous calling together of the\r\nThirty-seventh Congress of the United States in Extra Session--the\r\nCongress whose measures ultimately enabled President Lincoln and the\r\nUnion Armies to subdue the Rebellion and save the Union--the Congress\r\nwhose wise and patriotic deliberations resulted in the raising of those\r\ngigantic Armies and Navies, and in supplying the unlimited means,\r\nthrough the Tariff and National Bank Systems and otherwise, by which\r\nthose tremendous Forces could be both created and effectively operated\r\n--the Congress which cooperated with President Lincoln and those Forces in\r\npreparing the way for the destruction of the very corner-stone of the\r\nConfederacy, Slavery itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n                  LINCOLN'S TROUBLES AND TEMPTATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Rebels themselves, as has already been noted, by the employment of\r\ntheir Slaves in the construction of earthworks and other fortifications,\r\nand even in battle, at Bull Run and elsewhere, against the Union Forces,\r\nbrought the Thirty-seventh Congress, as well as the Military Commanders,\r\nand the President, to an early consideration of the Slavery question.\r\nBut it was none the less a question to be treated with the utmost\r\ndelicacy.\r\n\r\nThe Union men, as well as the Secession-sympathizers, of Kentucky and\r\nTennessee and Missouri and Maryland, largely believed in Slavery, or at\r\nleast were averse to any interference with it.  These, would not see\r\nthat the right to destroy that unholy Institution could pertain to any\r\nauthority, or be justified by any exigency; much less that, as held by\r\nsome authorities, its existence ceased at the moment when its hands, or\r\nthose of the State in which it had existed, were used to assail the\r\nGeneral Government.\r\n\r\nThey looked with especial suspicion and distrust upon the guarded\r\nutterances of the President upon all questions touching the future of\r\nthe Colored Race.\r\n\r\n     [At Faneuil Hall, Edward Everett is reported to have said, in\r\n     October of 1864:\r\n\r\n     \"It is very doubtful whether any act of the Government of the\r\n     United States was necessary to liberate the Slaves in a State which\r\n     is in Rebellion.  There is much reason for the opinion that, by the\r\n     simple act of levying War against the United States, the relation\r\n     of Slavery was terminated; certainly, so far as concerns the duty\r\n     of the United States to recognize it, or to refrain from\r\n     interfering with it.\r\n\r\n     \"Not being founded on the Law of Nature, and resting solely on\r\n     positive Local Law--and that, not of the United States--as soon as\r\n     it becomes either the motive or pretext of an unjust War against\r\n     the Union--an efficient instrument in the hands of the Rebels for\r\n     carrying on the War--source of Military strength to the Rebellion,\r\n     and of danger to the Government at home and abroad, with the\r\n     additional certainty that, in any event but its abandonment, it\r\n     will continue, in all future time to work these mischiefs, who can\r\n     suppose it is the duty of the United States to continue to\r\n     recognize it.\r\n\r\n     \"To maintain this would be a contradiction in terms.  It would be\r\n     two recognize a right in a Rebel master to employ his Slave in acts\r\n     of Rebellion and Treason, and the duty of the Slave to aid and abet\r\n     his master in the commission of the greatest crime known to the\r\n     Law.  No such absurdity can be admitted; and any citizen of the\r\n     United States, from thee President down, who should, by any overt\r\n     act, recognize the duty of a Slave to obey a Rebel master in a\r\n     hostile operation, would himself be giving aid and comfort to the\r\n     Enemy.\"]\r\n\r\nThey believed that when Fremont issued the General Order-heretofore\r\ngiven in full--in which that General declared that \"The property, real\r\nand personal, of all persons, in the State of Missouri, who shall take\r\nup arms against the United States, or who shall be directly proven to\r\nhave taken an active part with their enemies in the field, is declared\r\nto be confiscated to the public use, and their Slaves, if any they have,\r\nare hereby declared Free men,\" it must have been with the concurrence,\r\nif not at the suggestion, of the President; and, when the President\r\nsubsequently, September 11,1861, made an open Order directing that this\r\nclause of Fremont's General Order, or proclamation, should be \"so\r\nmodified, held, and construed, as to conform to, and not to transcend,\r\nthe provisions on the same subject contained in the Act of Congress\r\nentitled 'An Act to Confiscate Property used for Insurrectionary\r\nPurposes,' approved August 6, 1861,\" they still were not satisfied.\r\n\r\n     [The sections of the above Act, bearing upon the matter, are the\r\n     first and fourth, which are in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"That if, during the present or any future insurrection against the\r\n     Government of the United States, after the President of the United\r\n     States shall have declared, by proclamation, that the laws of the\r\n     United States are opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed, by\r\n     combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course\r\n     of judicial proceedings, or by the power vested in the marshals by\r\n     law, any person or persons, his, her, or their agent, attorney, or\r\n     employee, shall purchase or acquire, sell or give, any property of\r\n     whatsoever kind or description, with intent to use or employ the\r\n     same, or suffer the same to be used or employed, in aiding,\r\n     abetting, or promoting such insurrection or resistance to the laws,\r\n     or any persons engaged therein; or if any person or persons, being\r\n     the owner or owners of any such property, shall knowingly use or\r\n     employ, or consent to the use or employment of the same as\r\n     aforesaid, all such property is hereby declared to be lawful\r\n     subject of prize and capture wherever found; and it shall be the\r\n     duty of the President of the United States to cause the same to be\r\n     seized, confiscated and condemned.\"\r\n\r\n                     *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4.

It did not satisfy them.\r\n\r\nNeither had they been satisfied, when, within one year and four days\r\nafter \"Slavery opened its batteries of Treason, upon Fort Sumter,\" that\r\nNational curse and shame was banished from the Nation's Capital by\r\nCongressional enactment.\r\n\r\nThey were not satisfied even with Mr. Lincoln's conservative suggestions\r\nembodied in the Supplemental Act.\r\n\r\nNor were they satisfied with the General Instructions, of October 14,\r\n1861, from the War Department to its Generals, touching the employment\r\nof Fugitive Slaves within the Union Lines, and the assurance of just\r\ncompensation to loyal masters, therein contained, although all avoidable\r\ninterference with the Institution was therein reprobated.\r\n\r\nNothing satisfied them.  It was indeed one of the most curious of the\r\nmany phenomena of the War of the Rebellion, that when--as at the end of\r\n1861--it had become evident, as Secretary Cameron held, that it \"would\r\nbe National suicide\" to leave the Rebels in \"peaceful and secure\r\npossession of Slave Property, more valuable and efficient to them for\r\nWar, than forage, cotton, and Military stores,\" and that the Slaves\r\ncoming within our lines could not \"be held by the Government as Slaves,\"\r\nand should not be held as prisoners of War--still the loyal people of\r\nthese Border-States, could not bring themselves to save that Union,\r\nwhich they professed to love, by legislation on this tender subject.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, they opposed all legislation looking to any\r\ninterference with such Slave property.  Nothing that was proposed by Mr.\r\nLincoln, or any other, on this subject, could satisfy them.\r\n\r\nCongress enacted a law, approved March 13, 1862, embracing an additional\r\nArticle of War, which prohibited all officers \"from employing any of the\r\nforces under their respective Commands for the purpose of returning\r\nFugitives from Service or Labor who may have escaped from\r\nany persons to whom such Service or Labor is claimed to be due,\" and\r\nprescribed that \"Any officer who shall be found guilty by Court-Martial\r\nof violating this Article shall be dismissed from the Service.\" In both\r\nHouses, the loyal Border-State Representatives spoke and voted against\r\nits passage.\r\n\r\nOne week previously (March 6, 1862), President Lincoln, in an admirable\r\nMessage, hitherto herein given at length, found himself driven to broach\r\nto Congress the subject of Emancipation.  He had, in his First Annual\r\nMessage (December, 1861), declared that \"the Union must be preserved;\r\nand hence all indispensable means must be employed;\" but now, as a part\r\nof the War Policy, he proposed to Congress the adoption of a Joint\r\nResolution declaring \"That the United States ought to cooperate with any\r\nState which may adopt gradual abolishment of Slavery, giving to such\r\nState, pecuniary aid, to be used by such State in its discretion, to\r\ncompensate for the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such\r\nchange of System.\"\r\n\r\nIt was high time, he thought, that the idea of a gradual, compensated\r\nEmancipation, should begin to occupy the minds of those interested, \"so\r\nthat,\" to use his own words, \"they may begin to consider whether to\r\naccept or reject it,\" should Congress approve the suggestion.\r\n\r\nCongress did approve, and adopt, the Joint-Resolution, as we know\r\n--despite the opposition from the loyal element of the Border States--an\r\nopposition made in the teeth of their concession that Mr. Lincoln, in\r\nrecommending its adoption, was \"solely moved by a high patriotism and\r\nsincere devotion to the glory of his Country.\"\r\n\r\nBut, consistently with their usual course, they went to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, fresh from the Presidential presence, and, with their\r\nears still ringing with the common-sense utterances of the President,\r\nhalf of them voted against the Resolution, while the other half\r\nrefrained from voting at all.  And their opposition to this wise and\r\nmoderate proposition was mainly based upon the idea that it carried with\r\nit a threat--a covert threat.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was a warning, taking it in connection with the balance of\r\nthe Message, but a very wise and timely one.\r\n\r\nThese loyal Border-State men, however, could not see its wisdom, and at\r\na full meeting held upon the subject decided to oppose it, as they\r\nafterward did.  Its conciliatory spirit they could not comprehend; the\r\nkindly, temperate warning, they would not heed.  The most moderate of\r\nthem all,--[Mr. Crittenden of Kentucky.]--in the most moderate of his\r\nutterances, could not bring himself to the belief that this Resolution\r\nwas \"a measure exactly suited to the times.\"\r\n\r\n     [And such was the fatuity existing among the Slave-holders of the\r\n     Border States, that not one of those Slave States had wisdom enough\r\n     to take the liberal offer thus made by the General Government, of\r\n     compensation.  They afterward found their Slaves freed without\r\n     compensation.]\r\n\r\nSo, also, one month later, (April 11, 1862), when the Senate Bill\r\nproposing Emancipation in the District of Columbia, was before the\r\nHouse, the same spokesman and leader of the loyal Border-State men\r\nopposed it strenuously as not being suited to the times.  For, he\r\npersuasively protested: \"I do not say that you have not the power; but\r\nwould not that power be, at such a time as this, most unwisely and\r\nindiscreetly exercised.  That is the point.  Of all the times when an\r\nattempt was ever made to carry this measure, is not this the most\r\ninauspicious?  Is it not a time when the measure is most likely to\r\nproduce danger and mischief to the Country at large?  So it seems to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not now, nor would it ever be, the time, to pass this, or any\r\nother measure, touching the Institution of Slavery, likely to benefit\r\nthat Union to which these men professed such love and loyalty.\r\n\r\nTheir opposition, however, to the march of events, was of little avail\r\n--even when backed, as was almost invariably the case, by the other\r\nDemocratic votes from the Free States.  The opposition was obstructive,\r\nbut not effectual.  For this reason it was perhaps the more irritating\r\nto the Republicans, who were anxious to put Slavery where their great\r\nleader, Mr. Lincoln, had long before said it should be placed--\"in\r\ncourse of ultimate extinction.\"\r\n\r\nThis very irritation, however, only served to press such Anti-Slavery\r\nMeasures more rapidly forward.  By the 19th of June, 1862, a Bill \"to\r\nsecure Freedom to all persons within the Territories of the United\r\nStates\"--after a more strenuous fight against it than ever, on the part\r\nof Loyal and Copperhead Democrats, both from the Border and Free\r\nStates,--had passed Congress, and been approved by President Lincoln.\r\nIt provided, in just so many words, \"That, from and after the passage of\r\nthis Act, there shall be neither Slavery nor involuntary servitude in\r\nany of the Territories of the United States now existing, or which may\r\nat any time hereafter be formed or acquired by the United States,\r\notherwise than in punishment of crime, whereof the party shall have been\r\nduly convicted.\"\r\n\r\nHere, then, at last, was the great end and aim, with which Mr. Lincoln\r\nand the Republican Party started out, accomplished.  To repeat his\r\nphrase, Slavery was certainly now in course of ultimate extinction.\r\n\r\nBut since that doctrine had been first enunciated by Mr. Lincoln, events\r\nhad changed the aspect of things.  War had broken out, and the Slaves of\r\nthose engaged in armed Rebellion against the authority of the United\r\nStates Government, had been actually employed, as we have seen, on Rebel\r\nworks and fortifications whose guns were trailed upon the Armies of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the question of Slavery had ceased to be simply whether it\r\nshould be put in course of ultimate extinction, but whether, as a War\r\nMeasure--as a means of weakening the Enemy and strengthening the Union\r\n--the time had not already come to extinguish it, so far, at least, as the\r\nSlaves of those participating in the Rebellion, were concerned.\r\n\r\nCongress, as has been heretofore noted, had already long and heatedly\r\ndebated various propositions referring to Slavery and African\r\nColonization, and had enacted such of them as, in its wisdom, were\r\nconsidered necessary; and was now entering a further stormy period of\r\ncontention upon various other projects touching the Abolition of the\r\nFugitive Slave Laws, the Confiscation of Rebel Property, and the\r\nEmancipation of Slaves--all of which, of course, had been, and would be,\r\nvehemently assailed by the loyal Border-States men and their Free-State\r\nDemocratic allies.\r\n\r\nThis contention proceeded largely upon the lines of construction of that\r\nclause in the Constitution of the United States and its Amendments,\r\nwhich provides that no person shall be deprived of Life, Liberty, or\r\nProperty, without due process of Law, etc.  The one side holding that,\r\nsince the beginning of our Government, Slaves had been, under this\r\nclause, Unconstitutionally deprived of their Liberty; the other side\r\nholding that Slaves being \"property,\" it would be Unconstitutional under\r\nthe same clause, to deprive the Slave-owner of his Slave property.\r\n\r\nMr. Crittenden, the leader of the loyal Border-States men in Congress,\r\nwas at this time especially eloquent on this latter view of the\r\nConstitution.  In his speech of April 23, 1862, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, he even undertook to defend American Slavery under the\r\nshield of English Liberty!\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"It is necessary for the prosperity of any Government, for\r\npeace and harmony, that every man who acquires property shall feel that\r\nhe shall be protected in the enjoyment of it, and in his right to hold\r\nit.  It elevates the man; it gives him a feeling of dignity.  It is the\r\ngreat old English doctrine of Liberty.  Said Lord Mansfield, the rain\r\nmay beat against the cabin of an Englishman, the snow may penetrate it,\r\nbut the King dare not enter it without the consent of its owner.  That\r\nis the true English spirit.  It is the source of England's power.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again: \"The idea of property is deeply seated in our minds.  By the\r\nEnglish Law and by the American Law you have the right to take the life\r\nof any man who attempts, by violence, to take your property from you.\r\nSo far does the Spirit of these Laws go.  Let us not break down this\r\nidea of property.  It is the animating spirit of the Country.  Indeed it\r\nis the Spirit of Liberty and Freedom.\"\r\n\r\nThere was at this time, a growing belief in the minds of these loyal\r\nBorder-States men, that this question of Slavery-abolition was reaching\r\na crisis.  They saw \"the handwriting on the wall,\" but left no stone\r\nunturned to prevent, or at least to avert for a time, the coming\r\ncatastrophe.  They egged Congress, in the language of the distinguished\r\nKentuckian, to \"Let these unnecessary measures alone, for the present;\"\r\nand, as to the President, they now, not only volunteered in his defense,\r\nagainst the attacks of others, but strove also to capture him by their\r\narch flatteries.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\"--said Mr. Crittenden, in one of his most eloquent bursts, in the\r\nHouse of Representatives,--\"it is not my duty, perhaps, to defend the\r\nPresident of the United States.  * * * I voted against Mr. Lincoln, and\r\nopposed him honestly and sincerely; but Mr. Lincoln has won me to his\r\nside.  There is a niche in the Temple of Fame, a niche near to\r\nWashington, which should be occupied by the statue of him who shall,\r\nsave this Country.  Mr. Lincoln has a mighty destiny.  It is for him, if\r\nhe will, to step into that niche.  It is for him to be but President of\r\nthe People of the United States, and there will his statue be.  But, if\r\nhe choose to be, in these times, a mere sectarian and a party man, that\r\nniche will be reserved for some future and better Patriot.  It is in his\r\npower to occupy a place next Washington,--the Founder, and the\r\nPreserver, side by side.  Sir, Mr. Lincoln is no coward.  His not doing\r\nwhat the Constitution forbade him to do, is no proof of his cowardice.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Owen Lovejoy, the fiery Abolitionist, the very next\r\nday after the above remarks of Mr. Crittenden were delivered in the\r\nHouse, made a great speech in reply, taking the position that \"either\r\nSlavery, or the Republic, must perish; and the question for us to decide\r\nis, which shall it be?\"\r\n\r\nHe declared to the House: \"You cannot put down the rebellion and restore\r\nthe Union, without destroying Slavery.\"  He quoted the sublime language\r\nof Curran touching the Spirit of the British Law, which consecrates the\r\nsoil of Britain to the genius of Universal Emancipation,\r\n\r\n     [In these words:\r\n\r\n     \"I speak in the Spirit of the British law, which makes Liberty\r\n     commensurate with, and inseparable from, the British soil; which\r\n     proclaims even to the stranger and the sojourner the moment he sets\r\n     his foot upon British earth, that the ground on which he treads is\r\n     holy, and consecrated by the genius Of UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\n     \"No matter in what language his doom may have been pronounced; no\r\n     matter what complexion incompatible with Freedom, an Indian or an\r\n     African sun may have burnt upon him; no matter in what disastrous\r\n     battle his Liberty may have been cloven down; no matter with what\r\n     solemnities he may have been devoted upon the altar of Slavery; the\r\n     first moment he touches the sacred soil of Britain, the altar and\r\n     the god sink together in the dust; his Soul walks abroad in her own\r\n     majesty; his Body swells beyond the measure of his chains, that\r\n     burst from around him, and he stands redeemed, regenerated, and\r\n     disenthralled by the irresistible genius of UNIVERSAL\r\n     EMANCIPATION.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd Cowper's verse, wherein the poet says:\r\n\r\n     \"Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs\r\n     Receive our air, that moment they are Free,\"\r\n\r\n--and, after expressing his solicitude to have this true of America, as\r\nit already was true of the District of Columbia, he proceeded to say:\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman from Kentucky says he has a niche for Abraham Lincoln.\r\nWhere is it?  He pointed upward!  But, Sir, should the President follow\r\nthe counsels of that gentleman, and become the defender and perpetuator\r\nof human Slavery, he should point downward to some dungeon in the Temple\r\nof Moloch, who feeds on human blood and is surrounded with fires, where\r\nare forged manacles and chains for human limbs--in the crypts and\r\nrecesses of whose Temple, woman is scourged, and man tortured, and\r\noutside whose walls are lying dogs, gorged with human flesh, as Byron\r\ndescribes them stretched around Stamboul.  That is a suitable place for\r\nthe statue of one who would defend and perpetuate human Slavery.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then--after saying that \"the friends of American Slavery need not\r\nbeslime the President with their praise.  He is an Anti-Slavery man.  He\r\nhates human Bondage \"--the orator added these glowing words:\r\n\r\n\"I, too, have a niche for Abraham Lincoln; but it is in Freedom's Holy\r\nFane, and not in the blood-besmeared Temple of human Bondage; not\r\nsurrounded by Slaves, fetters and chains, but with the symbols of\r\nFreedom; not dark with Bondage, but radiant with the light of Liberty.\r\nIn that niche he shall stand proudly, nobly, gloriously, with shattered\r\nfetters and broken chains and slave-whips beneath his feet.  If Abraham\r\nLincoln pursues the path, evidently pointed out for him in the\r\nprovidence of God, as I believe he will, then he will occupy the proud\r\nposition I have indicated.  That is a fame worth living for; ay, more,\r\nthat is a fame worth dying for, though that death led through the blood\r\nof Gethsemane and the agony of the Accursed Tree.  That is a fame which\r\nhas glory and honor and immortality and Eternal Life.  Let Abraham\r\nLincoln make himself, as I trust he will, the Emancipator, the\r\nLiberator, as he has the opportunity of doing, and his name shall not\r\nonly be enrolled in this Earthly Temple, but it will be traced on the\r\nliving stones of that Temple which rears itself amid the Thrones and\r\nHierarchies of Heaven, whose top-stone is to be brought in with shouting\r\nof 'Grace, grace unto it!'\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the loyal Border-State men, through their chosen\r\nRepresentative--finding that their steady and unfaltering opposition to\r\nall Mr. Lincoln's propositions, while quite ineffectual, did not serve\r\nby any means to increase his respect for their peculiar kind of loyalty\r\n--offered him posthumous honors and worship if he would but do as they\r\ndesired.  Had they possessed the power, no doubt they would have taken\r\nhim up into an exceeding high mountain and have offered to him all the\r\nKingdoms of the Earth to do their bidding.  But their temptations were\r\nof no avail.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln's duty, and inclination alike--no less than the\r\nearnest importunities of the Abolitionists--carried him in the opposite\r\ndirection; but carried him no farther than he thought it safe, and wise,\r\nto go.  For, in whatever he might do on this burning question of\r\nEmancipation, he was determined to secure that adequate support from the\r\nPeople without which even Presidential Proclamations are waste paper.\r\n\r\nBut now, May 9, 1862, was suddenly issued by General Hunter, commanding\r\nthe \"Department of the South,\" comprising Georgia, Florida and South\r\nCarolina, his celebrated Order announcing Martial Law, in those States,\r\nas a Military Necessity, and--as \"Slavery and Martial Law in a Free\r\nCountry are altogether incompatible\"--declaring all Slaves therein,\r\n\"forever Free.\"\r\n\r\nThis second edition, as it were, of Fremont's performance, at once threw\r\nthe loyal Border-State men into a terrible ferment.  Again, they, and\r\ntheir Copperhead and other Democratic friends of the North, meanly\r\nprofessed belief that this was but a part of Mr. Lincoln's programme,\r\nand that his apparent backwardness was the cloak to hide his\r\nAnti-Slavery aggressiveness and insincerity.\r\n\r\nHow hurtful the insinuations, and even direct charges, of the day, made\r\nby these men against President Lincoln, must have been to his honest,\r\nsincere, and sensitive nature, can scarcely be conceived by those who\r\ndid not know him; while, on the other hand, the reckless impatience of\r\nsome of his friends for \"immediate and universal Emancipation,\" and\r\ntheir complaints at his slow progress toward that goal of their hopes,\r\nmust have been equally trying.\r\n\r\nTrue to himself, however, and to the wise conservative course which he\r\nhad marked out, and, thus far, followed, President Lincoln hastened to\r\ndisavow Hunter's action in the premises, by a Proclamation, heretofore\r\ngiven, declaring that no person had been authorized by the United States\r\nGovernment to declare the Slaves of any State, Free; that Hunter's\r\naction in this respect was void; that, as Commander-in-chief he reserved\r\nsolely to himself, the questions, first, as to whether he had the power\r\nto declare the Slaves of any State or States, Free, and, second, whether\r\nthe time and necessity for the exercise of such supposed power had\r\narrived.  And then, as we may remember, he proceeded to cite the\r\nadoption, by overwhelming majorities in Congress, of the Joint\r\nResolution offering pecuniary aid from the National Government to \"any\r\nState which may adopt a gradual abolishment of Slavery;\" and to make a\r\nmost earnest appeal, for support, to the Border-States and to their\r\npeople, as being \"the most interested in the subject matter.\"\r\n\r\nIn his Special Message to Congress,--[Of March 6, 1862.]--recommending\r\nthe passage of that Joint Resolution, he had plainly and emphatically\r\ndeclared himself against sudden Emancipation of Slaves.  He had therein\r\ndistinctly said: \"In my judgment, gradual, and not immediate,\r\nEmancipation, is better for all.\"  And now, in this second appeal of his\r\nto the Border-States men, to patriotically close with the proposal\r\nembraced in that.  Resolution, he said: \"The changes it contemplates\r\nwould come gently as the dews of Heaven, not rending or wrecking\r\nanything.  Will you not embrace it?  So much good has not been done, by\r\none effort, in all past time, as, in the providence of God, it is now\r\nyour high privilege to do!  May the vast future not have to lament that\r\nyou have neglected it!\"\r\n\r\n     [The following letter, from Sumner, shows the impatience of some of\r\n     the President's friends, the confidence he inspired in others\r\n     nearer in his counsels, and how entirely, at this time, his mind\r\n     was absorbed in his project for gradual and compensated\r\n     Emancipation.]\r\n\r\n                         \"SENATE CHAMBER, June 5, 1862.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR.--Your criticism of the President is hasty.  I am\r\n     confident that, if you knew him as I do, you would not make it.  Of\r\n     course the President cannot be held responsible for the\r\n     misfeasances of subordinates, unless adopted or at least tolerated\r\n     by him.  And I am sure that nothing unjust or ungenerous will be\r\n     tolerated, much less adopted, by him.\r\n\r\n     \"I am happy to let you know that he has no sympathy with Stanly in\r\n     his absurd wickedness, closing the schools, nor again in his other\r\n     act of turning our camp into a hunting ground for Slaves.  He\r\n     repudiates both--positively.  The latter point has occupied much of\r\n     his thought; and the newspapers have not gone too far in recording\r\n     his repeated declarations, which I have often heard from his own\r\n     lips, that Slaves finding their way into the National lines are\r\n     never to be Re-enslaved--This is his conviction, expressed without\r\n     reserve.\r\n\r\n     \"Could you have seen the President--as it was my privilege often\r\n     --while he was considering the great questions on which he has\r\n     already acted--the invitation to Emancipation in the States,\r\n     Emancipation in the District of Columbia, and the acknowledgment of\r\n     the Independence of Hayti and Liberia--even your zeal would have\r\n     been satisfied, for you would have felt the sincerity of his\r\n     purpose to do what he could to carry forward the principles of the\r\n     Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\n     \"His whole soul was occupied, especially by the first proposition,\r\n     which was peculiarly his own.  In familiar intercourse with him, I\r\n     remember nothing more touching than the earnestness and\r\n     completeness with which he embraced this idea.  To his mind, it was\r\n     just and beneficent, while it promised the sure end of Slavery.  Of\r\n     course, to me, who had already proposed a bridge of gold for the\r\n     retreating fiend, it was most welcome.  Proceeding from the\r\n     President, it must take its place among the great events of\r\n     history.\r\n\r\n     \"If you are disposed to be impatient at any seeming\r\n     shortcomings, think, I pray you, of what has been done in a brief\r\n     period, and from the past discern the sure promise of the future.\r\n     Knowing something of my convictions and of the ardor with which I\r\n     maintain them, you may, perhaps, derive some assurance from my\r\n     confidence; I may say to you, therefore, stand by the\r\n     Administration.  If need be, help it by word and act, but stand by\r\n     it and have faith in it.\r\n\r\n     \"I wish that you really knew the President, and had heard the\r\n     artless expression of his convictions on those questions which\r\n     concern you so deeply.  You might, perhaps, wish that he were less\r\n     cautious, but you would be grateful that he is so true to all that\r\n     you have at heart.  Believe me, therefore, you are wrong, and I\r\n     regret it the more because of my desire to see all our friends\r\n     stand firmly together.\r\n\r\n     \"If I write strongly it is because I feel strongly; for my constant\r\n     and intimate intercourse with the President, beginning with the 4th\r\n     of March, not only binds me peculiarly to his Administration, but\r\n     gives me a personal as well as a political interest in seeing that\r\n     justice is done him.\r\n\r\n     \"Believe me, my dear Sir, with much regard, ever faithfully yours,\r\n                              \"CHARLES SUMNER.\"\r\n\r\nBut stones are not more deaf to entreaty than were the ears of the loyal\r\nBorder-State men and their allies to President Lincoln's renewed appeal.\r\n\"Ephraim\" was \"wedded to his idols.\"\r\n\r\nMcClellan too--immediately after his retreat from the Chickahominy to\r\nthe James River--seized the opportunity afforded by the disasters to our\r\narms, for which he was responsible, to write to President Lincoln a\r\nletter (dated July 7, 1862) in which he admonished him that owing to the\r\n\"critical\" condition of the Army of the Potomac, and the danger of its\r\nbeing \"overwhelmed\" by the Enemy in front, the President must now\r\nsubstantially assume and exercise the powers of a Dictator, or all would\r\nbe lost; that \"neither Confiscation of property * * * nor forcible\r\nAbolition of Slavery, should be contemplated for a moment;\" and that \"A\r\ndeclaration of Radical views, especially upon Slavery, will rapidly\r\ndisintegrate our present Armies.\"\r\n\r\nHarried, and worried, on all sides,--threatened even by the Commander of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac,--it is not surprising, in view of the\r\napparently irreconcilable attitude of the loyal Border-State men to\r\ngradual and compensated Emancipation, that the tension of President\r\nLincoln's mind began to feel a measure of relief in contemplating\r\nMilitary Emancipation in the teeth of all such threats.\r\n\r\nHe had long since made up his mind that the existence of Slavery was not\r\ncompatible with the preservation of the Union.  The only question now\r\nwas, how to get rid of it?  If the worst should come to the worst\r\n--despite McClellan's threat--he would have to risk everything on the turn\r\nof the die--would have to \"play his last card;\" and that \"last card\" was\r\nMilitary Emancipation.  Yet still he disliked to play it.  The time and\r\nnecessity for it had not yet arrived--although he thought he saw them\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\n     [In the course of an article in the New York Tribune, August, 1885,\r\n     Hon.  George S.  Boutwell tells of an interview in \"July or early\r\n     in August\" of 1862, with President Lincoln, at which the latter\r\n     read two letters: one from a Louisiana man \"who claimed to be a\r\n     Union man,\" but sought to impress the President with \"the dangers\r\n     and evils of Emancipation;\" the other, Mr. Lincoln's reply to him,\r\n     in which, says Mr. B., \"he used this expression: 'you must not\r\n     expect me to give up this Government without playing my last card.'\r\n     Emancipation was his last card.\"]\r\n\r\nThings were certainly, at this time, sufficiently unpromising to chill\r\nthe sturdiest Patriot's heart.  It is true, we had scored some important\r\nvictories in the West; but in the East, our arms seemed fated to\r\ndisaster after disaster.  Belmont, Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, and\r\nPittsburg Landing, were names whose mention made the blood of Patriots\r\nto surge in their veins; and Corinth, too, had fallen.  But in the East,\r\nMcClellan's profitless campaign against Richmond, and especially his\r\ndisastrous \"change of base\" by a \"masterly\" seven days' retreat,\r\ninvolving as many bloody battles, had greatly dispirited all Union men,\r\nand encouraged the Rebels and Rebel-sympathizers to renewed hopes and\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nAnd, as reverses came to the Union Arms, so seemed to grow\r\nproportionately the efforts, on all sides, to force forward, or to stave\r\noff, as the case might be, the great question of the liberation and\r\narming of the Slaves, as a War Measure, under the War powers of the\r\nConstitution.  It was about this time (July 12, 1862) that President\r\nLincoln determined to make a third, and last, attempt to avert the\r\nnecessity for thus emancipating and arming the Slaves.  He invited all\r\nthe Senators and Representatives in Congress from the Border-States, to\r\nan interview at the White House, and made to them the appeal, heretofore\r\nin these pages given at length.\r\n\r\nIt was an earnest, eloquent, wise, kindly, patriotic, fatherly appeal in\r\nbehalf of his old proposition, for a gradual, compensated Emancipation,\r\nby the Slave States, aided by the resources of the National Government.\r\n\r\nAt the very time of making it, he probably had, in his drawer, the rough\r\ndraft of the Proclamation which was soon to give Liberty to all the\r\nColored millions of the Land.\r\n\r\n     [McPherson gives a letter, written from Washington, by Owen Lovejoy\r\n     (Feb. 22, 1864), to Wm. Lloyd Garrison, in which the following\r\n     passage occurs:\r\n\r\n     \"Recurring to the President, there are a great many reports\r\n     concerning him which seem to be reliable and authentic, which,\r\n     after all, are not so.  It was currently reported among the\r\n     Anti-Slavery men of Illinois that the Emancipation Proclamation was\r\n     extorted from him by the outward pressure, and particularly by the\r\n     Delegation from the Christian Convention that met at Chicago.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, the fact is this, as I had it from his own lips: He had\r\n     written the Proclamation in the Summer, as early as June, I think\r\n     --but will not be certain as to the precise time--and called his\r\n     Cabinet together, and informed them he had written it and meant to\r\n     make it, but wanted to read it to them for any criticism or remarks\r\n     as to its features or details.\r\n\r\n     \"After having done so, Mr. Seward suggested whether it would not be\r\n     well for him to withhold its publication until after we had gained\r\n     some substantial advantage in the Field, as at that time we had met\r\n     with many reverses, and it might be considered a cry of despair.\r\n     He told me he thought the suggestion a wise one, and so held on to\r\n     the Proclamation until after the Battle of Antietam.\"]\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, however, sufficient evidences exist, to prove that he\r\nmust have been fully aware, at the time of making that appeal to the\r\nsupposed patriotism of these Border-State men, how much, how very much,\r\ndepended on the manner of their reception of it.\r\n\r\nTo him, that meeting was a very solemn and portentous one.  He had\r\nstudied the question long and deeply--not from the standpoint of his own\r\nmere individual feelings and judgment, but from that of fair\r\nConstitutional construction, as interpreted by the light of Natural or\r\nGeneral Law and right reason.  What he sought to impress upon them was,\r\nthat an immediate decision by the Border-States to adopt, and in due\r\ntime carry out, with the financial help of the General Government, a\r\npolicy of gradual Emancipation, would simultaneously solve the two\r\nintimately-blended problems of Slavery-destruction and\r\nUnion-preservation, in the best possible manner for the pockets and\r\nfeelings of the Border-State Slave-holder, and for the other interests\r\nof both Border-State Slave-holder and Slave.\r\n\r\nHis great anxiety was to \"perpetuate,\" as well as to save, to the People\r\nof the World, the imperiled form of Popular Government, and assure to it\r\na happy and a grand future.\r\n\r\nHe begged these Congressmen from the Border-States, to help him carry\r\nout this, his beneficent plan, in the way that was best for all, and\r\nthus at the same time utterly deprive the Rebel Confederacy of that\r\nhope, which still possessed them, of ultimately gathering these States\r\ninto their rebellious fold.  And he very plainly, at the same time,\r\nconfessed that he desired this relief from the Abolition pressure upon\r\nhim, which had been growing more intense ever since he had repudiated\r\nthe Hunter proclamation.\r\n\r\nBut the President's earnest appeal to these loyal Representatives in\r\nCongress from the Border-States, was, as we have seen, in vain.  It\r\nmight as well have been made to actual Rebels, for all the good it did.\r\nFor, a few days afterward, they sent to him a reply signed by more than\r\ntwo-thirds of those present, hitherto given at length in these pages, in\r\nwhich-after loftily sneering at the proposition as \"an interference by\r\nthis Government with a question which peculiarly and exclusively\r\nbelonged to\" their \"respective States, on which they had not sought\r\nadvice or solicited aid,\" throwing doubts upon the Constitutional power\r\nof the General Government to give the financial aid, and undertaking by\r\nstatistics to prove that it would absolutely bankrupt the Government to\r\ngive such aid,--they insultingly declared, in substance, that they could\r\nnot \"trust anything to the contingencies of future legislation,\" and\r\nthat Congress must \"provide sufficient funds\" and place those funds in\r\nthe President's hands for the purpose, before the Border-States and\r\ntheir people would condescend even to \"take this proposition into\r\ncareful consideration, for such decision as in their judgment is\r\ndemanded by their interest, their honor, and their duty to the whole\r\nCountry.\"\r\n\r\nVery different in tone, to be sure, was the minority reply, which, after\r\nstating that \"the leaders of the Southern Rebellion have offered to\r\nabolish Slavery among them as a condition to Foreign Intervention in\r\nfavor of their Independence as a Nation,\" concluded with the terse and\r\nloyal deduction: \"If they can give up Slavery to destroy the Union, we\r\ncan surely ask our people to consider the question of Emancipation to\r\nsave the Union.\"\r\n\r\nBut those who signed this latter reply were few, among the many.\r\nPractically, the Border-State men were a unit against Mr. Lincoln's\r\nproposition, and against its fair consideration by their people.  He\r\nasked for meat, and they gave him a stone.\r\n\r\nOnly a few days before this interview, President Lincoln--alarmed by the\r\nreport of McClellan, that the magnificent Army of the Potomac under his\r\ncommand, which, only three months before, had boasted 161,000 men, had\r\ndwindled down to not more than \"50,000 men left with their colors\"--had\r\nbeen to the front, at Harrison's Landing, on the James river, and,\r\nalthough he had not found things quite so disheartening as he had been\r\nled to believe, yet they were bad enough, for only 86,000 men were found\r\nby him on duty, while 75,000 were unaccounted for--of which number\r\n34,4172 were afterward reported as \"absent by authority.\"\r\n\r\nThis condition of affairs, in connection with the fact that McClellan\r\nwas always calling for more troops, undoubtedly had its influence in\r\nbringing Mr. Lincoln's mind to the conviction, hitherto mentioned, of\r\nthe fast-approaching Military necessity for Freeing and Arming the\r\nSlaves.\r\n\r\nIt was to ward this off, if possible, that he had met and appealed to\r\nthe Border-State Representatives.  They had answered him with sneers and\r\ninsults; and nothing was left him but the extreme course of almost\r\nimmediate Emancipation.\r\n\r\nLong and anxiously he had thought over the matter, but the time for\r\naction was at hand.\r\n\r\nAnd now, it cannot be better told, than in President Lincoln's own\r\nwords, as given to the portrait-painter Carpenter, and recorded in the\r\nlatter's, \"Six months in the White House,\" what followed:\r\n\r\n\"It had got to be,\" said he, \"midsummer, 1862.  Things had gone on from\r\nbad to worse, until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on\r\nthe plan of operations we had been pursuing; that we had about played\r\nour last card, and must change our tactics, or lose the game!\r\n\r\n\"I now determined upon the adoption of the Emancipation Policy; and,\r\nwithout consultation with, or the knowledge of, the Cabinet, I prepared\r\nthe original draft of the Proclamation, and, after much anxious thought,\r\ncalled a Cabinet meeting upon the subject.  This was the last of July,\r\nor the first part of the month of August, 1862.\"  (The exact date he did\r\nnot remember.)\r\n\r\n\"This Cabinet meeting took place, I think, upon a Saturday.  All were\r\npresent, excepting Mr. Blair, the Postmaster-General, who was absent at\r\nthe opening of the discussion, but came in subsequently.  I said to the\r\nCabinet, that I had resolved upon this step, and had not called them\r\ntogether to ask their advice, but to lay the subject-matter of a\r\nProclamation before them; suggestions as to which would be in order,\r\nafter they had heard it read.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lovejoy was in error\" when he stated \"that it excited no comment,\r\nexcepting on the part of Secretary Seward.  Various suggestions were\r\noffered.  Secretary Chase wished the language stronger, in reference to\r\nthe arming of the Blacks.  Mr. Blair, after he came in, deprecated the\r\npolicy, on the ground that it would cost the Administration the fall\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, however, was offered, that I had not already\r\nfully anticipated and settled in my own mind, until Secretary Seward\r\nspoke.  He said in substance: 'Mr. President, I approve of the\r\nProclamation, but I question the expediency of its issue at this\r\njuncture.  The depression of the public mind, consequent upon our\r\nrepeated reverses, is so great that I fear the effect of so important a\r\nstep.  It may be viewed as the last Measure of an exhausted Government,\r\na cry for help, the Government stretching forth its hands to Ethiopia,\r\ninstead of Ethiopia stretching forth her hands to the Government.'\r\n\r\n\"His idea,\" said the President \"was that it would be considered our last\r\nshriek, on the retreat.\" (This was his precise expression.)  \"' Now,'\r\ncontinued Mr. Seward, 'while I approve the Measure, I suggest, Sir, that\r\nyou postpone its issue, until you can give it to the Country supported\r\nby Military success, instead of issuing it, as would be the case now,\r\nupon the greatest disasters of the War!'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln continued: \"The wisdom of the view of the Secretary of\r\nState, struck me with very great force.  It was an aspect of the case\r\nthat, in all my thought upon the subject, I had entirely overlooked.\r\nThe result was that I put the draft of the Proclamation aside, as you do\r\nyour sketch for a picture, waiting for a victory.\"\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to interrupt the President's narration to Mr.\r\nCarpenter, at this point, with a few words touching \"the Military\r\nSituation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter McClellan's inexplicable retreat from before the Rebel Capital\r\n--when, having gained a great victory at Malvern Hills, Richmond would\r\nundoubtedly have been ours, had he but followed it up, instead of\r\nordering his victorious troops to retreat like \"a whipped Army\"--[See\r\nGeneral Hooker's testimony before the Committee on the Conduct of the\r\nWar.]--his recommendation, in the extraordinary letter (of July 7th) to\r\nthe President, for the creation of the office of General-in-Chief, was\r\nadopted, and Halleck, then at Corinth, was ordered East, to fill it.\r\n\r\nPope had previously been called from the West, to take\r\ncommand of the troops covering Washington, comprising some 40,000 men,\r\nknown as the Army of Virginia; and, finding cordial cooperation with\r\nMcClellan impossible, had made a similar suggestion.\r\n\r\nSoon after Halleck's arrival, that General ordered the transfer of the\r\nArmy of the Potomac, from Harrison's Landing to Acquia creek--on the\r\nPotomac--with a view to a new advance upon Richmond, from the\r\nRappahannock river.\r\n\r\nWhile this was being slowly accomplished, Lee, relieved from fears for\r\nRichmond, decided to advance upon Washington, and speedily commenced the\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of August, 1862, Stonewall Jackson, leading the Rebel\r\nadvance, had crossed the Rapidan; on the 9th the bloody Battle of Cedar\r\nMountain had been fought with part of Pope's Army; and on the 11th,\r\nJackson had retreated across the Rapidan again.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Pope having retired across the Rappahannock, Lee's Forces,\r\nby flanking Pope's Army, again resumed their Northern advance.  August\r\n28th and 29th witnessed the bloody Battles of Groveton and Gainesville,\r\nVirginia; the 30th saw the defeat of Pope, by Lee, at the second great\r\nBattle of Bull Run, and the falling back of Pope's Army toward\r\nWashington; and the succeeding Battle of Chantilly took place September\r\n1, 1862.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary at this time to even touch upon the causes and\r\nagencies which brought such misfortune to the Union Arms, under Pope.\r\nIt is sufficient to say here, that the disaster of the second Bull Run\r\nwas a dreadful blow to the Union Cause, and correspondingly elated the\r\nRebels.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, in transmitting to the Rebel Congress at Richmond,\r\nLee's victorious announcements, said, in his message: \"From these\r\ndispatches it will be seen that God has again extended His shield over\r\nour patriotic Army, and has blessed the cause of the Confederacy with a\r\nsecond signal victory, on the field already memorable by the gallant\r\nachievement of our troops.\"\r\n\r\nFlushed with victory, but wisely avoiding the fortifications of the\r\nNational Capital, Lee's Forces now swept past Washington; crossed the\r\nPotomac, near Point of Rocks, at its rear; and menaced both the National\r\nCapital and Baltimore.\r\n\r\nYielding to the apparent necessity of the moment, the President again\r\nplaced.  McClellan in command of the Armies about Washington, to wit:\r\nthe Army of the Potomac; Burnside's troops that had come up from North\r\nCarolina; what remained of Pope's Army of Virginia; and the large\r\nreinforcements from fresh levies, constantly and rapidly pouring in.\r\n\r\n     [This was probably about the time of the occurrence of an amusing\r\n     incident, touching Lincoln, McClellan, and the fortifications\r\n     around Washington, afterward told by General J. G. Barnard, then\r\n     Chief of Engineers on the staff of General George B.  McClellan.\r\n     --See New York Tribune, October 21, 1885.  It seems that the\r\n     fortifications having been completed, McClellan invited Mr. Lincoln\r\n     and his Cabinet to inspect them.  \"On the day appointed,\" said\r\n     Barnard, \"the Inspection commenced at Arlington, to the Southwest\r\n     of Washington, and in front of the Enemy.  We followed the line of\r\n     the works southerly, and recrossed the Potomac to the easterly side\r\n     of the river, and continued along the line easterly of Washington\r\n     and into the heaviest of all the fortifications on the northerly\r\n     side of Washington.  When we reached this point the President asked\r\n     General McClellan to explain the necessity of so strong a\r\n     fortification between Washington and the North.\r\n\r\n     \"General McClellan replied: 'Why, Mr. President, according to\r\n     Military Science it is our duty to guard against every possible or\r\n     supposable contingency that may arise.  For example, if under any\r\n     circumstances, however fortuitous, the Enemy, by any chance or\r\n     freak, should, in a last resort, get in behind Washington, in his\r\n     efforts to capture the city, why, there the fort is to defend it.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Yes, that's so General,' said the President; 'the precaution is\r\n     doubtless a wise one, and I'm glad to get so clear an explanation,\r\n     for it reminds me of an interesting question once discussed for\r\n     several weeks in our Lyceum, or Moot Court, at Springfield, Ill.,\r\n     soon after I began reading law.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Ah!' says General McClellan.  'What question was that, Mr.\r\n     President?'\r\n\r\n     \"'The question,' Mr. Lincoln replied, 'was, \"Why does man have\r\n     breasts?\"' and he added that after many evenings' debate, the\r\n     question was submitted to the presiding Judge, who wisely decided\r\n     'That if under any circumstances, however fortuitous, or by any\r\n     chance or freak, no matter of what nature or by what cause, a man\r\n     should have a baby, there would be the breasts to nurse it.'\"]\r\n\r\nYet, it was not until the 17th of September that the Battle of Antietam\r\nwas fought, and Lee defeated--and then only to be allowed to slip back,\r\nacross the Potomac, on the 18th--McClellan leisurely following him,\r\nacross that river, on the 2nd of November!\r\n\r\n     [Arnold, in his \"Life of Abraham Lincoln,\" says that President\r\n     Lincoln said of him: \"With all his failings as a soldier, McClellan\r\n     is a pleasant and scholarly gentleman.  He is an admirable\r\n     Engineer, but\" he added, \"he seems to have a special talent for a\r\n     stationary Engine.\"]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th, McClellan was relieved,--Burnside taking the command,--and\r\nUnion men breathed more freely again.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the subject of Emancipation.  President Lincoln's own\r\nwords have already been given--in conversation with Carpenter--down to\r\nthe reading of the Proclamation to his Cabinet, and Seward's suggestion\r\nto \"wait for a victory\" before issuing it, and how, adopting that\r\nadvice, he laid the Proclamation aside, waiting for a victory.\r\n\r\n\"From time to time,\" said Mr. Lincoln, continuing his narration, \"I\r\nadded or changed a line, touching it up here and there, anxiously\r\nwaiting the progress of events.  Well, the next news we had was of\r\nPope's disaster at Bull Run.  Things looked darker than ever.  Finally,\r\ncame the week of the Battle of Antietam.  I determined to wait no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\"The news came, I think, on Wednesday, that the advantage was on our\r\nside.  I was then staying at the Soldiers' Home (three miles out of\r\nWashington.)  Here I finished writing the second draft of the\r\npreliminary Proclamation; came up on Saturday; called the Cabinet\r\ntogether to hear it; and it was published the following Monday.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not uninteresting to note, in this connection, upon the same\r\nauthority, that at the final meeting of the Cabinet prior to this issue\r\nof the Proclamation, when the third paragraph was read, and the words of\r\nthe draft \"will recognize the Freedom of such Persons,\" were reached,\r\nMr. Seward suggested the insertion of the words \"and maintain\" after the\r\nword \"recognize;\" and upon his insistence, the President said, \"the\r\nwords finally went in.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, then, had gone forth the Fiat--telegraphed and read throughout\r\nthe Land, on that memorable 22d of September, 1862--which, with the\r\nsupplemental Proclamation of January 1, 1863, was to bring joy and\r\nFreedom to the millions of Black Bondsmen of the South.\r\n\r\nJust one month before its issue, in answer to Horace Greeley's Open\r\nletter berating him for \"the seeming subserviency\" of his \"policy to the\r\nSlave-holding, Slave up-holding interest,\" etc., President Lincoln had\r\nwritten his famous \"Union letter\" in which he had conservatively said:\r\n\"My paramount object is to save the Union, and not either to save or\r\ndestroy Slavery.  If I could save the Union without freeing any Slave, I\r\nwould do it--and if I could save it by freeing all the Slaves, I would\r\ndo it--and if I could save it by freeing some, and leaving others alone,\r\nI would also do that.\"\r\n\r\nNo one outside of his Cabinet dreamed, at the time he made that answer,\r\nthat the Proclamation of Emancipation was already written, and simply\r\nawaited a turn in the tide of battle for its issue!\r\n\r\nStill less could it have been supposed, when, on the 13th of September\r\n--only two days before Stonewall Jackson had invested, attacked, and\r\ncaptured Harper's Ferry with nearly 12,000 prisoners, 73 cannon, and\r\n13,000 small arms, besides other spoils of War--Mr. Lincoln received the\r\ndeputation from the religious bodies of Chicago, bearing a Memorial for\r\nthe immediate issue of such a Proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe very language of his reply,--where he said to them: \"It is my\r\nearnest desire to know the will of Providence in this matter.  And if I\r\ncan learn what it is, I will do it!  These are not, however, the days of\r\nmiracles, and I suppose it will be granted that I am not to expect a\r\ndirect revelation.  I must study the plain physical aspects of the case,\r\nascertain what is possible, and learn what appears to be wise and\r\nright\"--when taken in connection with the very strong argument with\r\nwhich he followed it up, against the policy of Emancipation advocated in\r\nthe Memorial, and his intimation that a Proclamation of Emancipation\r\nissued by him \"must necessarily be inoperative, like the Pope's Bull\r\nagainst the Comet!\"--would almost seem to have been adopted with the\r\nvery object of veiling his real purpose from the public eye, and leaving\r\nthe public mind in doubt.  At all events, it had that effect.\r\n\r\nArnold, in his \"Life of Lincoln,\" says of this time, when General Lee\r\nwas marching Northward toward Pennsylvania, that \"now, the President,\r\nwith that tinge of superstition which ran through his character, 'made,'\r\nas he said, 'a solemn vow to God, that, if Lee was driven back, he would\r\nissue the Proclamation;'\" and, in the light of that statement, the\r\nconcluding words of Mr. Lincoln's reply to the deputation aforesaid:--\"I\r\ncan assure you that the subject is on my mind, by day and night, more\r\nthan any other.  Whatever shall appear to be God's will, I will do,\"\r\n--have a new meaning.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation, when issued, was a great surprise, but\r\nwas none the less generally well-received by the Union Armies, and\r\nthroughout the Loyal States of the Union, while, in some of them, its\r\nreception was most enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nIt happened, too, as we have seen, that the Convention of the Governors\r\nof the Loyal States met at Altoona, Penn., on the very day of its\r\npromulgation, and in an address to the President adopted by these loyal\r\nGovernors, they publicly hailed it \"with heartfelt gratitude and\r\nencouraged hope,\" and declared that \"the decision of the President to\r\nstrike at the root of the Rebellion will lend new vigor to efforts, and\r\nnew life and hope to the hearts, of the People.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the loyal Border-States men were dreadfully exercised\r\non the subject; and those of them in the House of Representatives\r\nemphasized their disapproval by their votes, when, on the 11th and 15th\r\nof the following December, Resolutions, respectively denouncing, and\r\nendorsing, \"the policy of Emancipation, as indicated in that\r\nProclamation,\" of September 22, 1862, were offered and voted on.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the loyal Border-States men's bitter opposition, however,\r\nthe Resolution endorsing that policy as a War Measure, and declaring the\r\nProclamation to be \"an exercise of power with proper regard for the\r\nrights of the States and the perpetuity of Free Government,\" as we have\r\nseen, passed the House.\r\n\r\nOf course the Rebels themselves, against whom it was aimed, gnashed\r\ntheir teeth in impotent rage over the Proclamation.  But they lost no\r\ntime in declaring that it was only a proof of what they had always\r\nannounced: that the War was not for the preservation of the American\r\nUnion, but for the destruction of African Slavery, and the spoilation of\r\nthe Southern States.\r\n\r\nThrough their friends and emissaries, in the Border and other Loyal\r\nStates of the Union,--the \"Knights of the Golden Circle,\"--\r\n\r\n     [The \"Knights of the Golden Circle\" was the most extensive of these\r\n     Rebel organizations.  It was \"an auxiliary force to the Rebel\r\n     Army.\"  Its members took an obligation of the most binding\r\n     character, the violation of which was punishable by death, which\r\n     obligation, in the language of another, \"pledged them to use every\r\n     possible means in their power to aid the Rebels to gain their\r\n     Independence; to aid and assist Rebel prisoners to escape; to vote\r\n     for no one for Office who was not opposed to the further\r\n     prosecution of the War; to encourage desertions from the Union\r\n     Army; to protect the Rebels in all things necessary to carry out\r\n     their designs, even to the burning and destroying of towns and\r\n     cities, if necessary to produce the desired result; to give such\r\n     information as they had, at all times, of the movements of our\r\n     Armies, and of the return of soldiers to their homes; and to try\r\n     and prevent their going back to their regiments at the front.\"\r\n\r\n     In other words the duty of the Organization and of its members, was\r\n     to hamper, oppose, and prevent all things possible that were being\r\n     done at any time for the Union Cause, and to encourage, forward,\r\n     and help all things possible in behalf of the Rebel Cause.\r\n\r\n     It was to be a flanking force of the Enemy--a reverse fire--a fire\r\n     in the rear of the Union Army, by Northern men; a powerful\r\n     cooperating force--all the more powerful because secret--operating\r\n     safely because secretly and in silence--and breeding discontent,\r\n     envy, hatred, and other ill feelings wherever possible, in and out\r\n     of Army circles, from the highest to the lowest, at all possible\r\n     times, and on all possible occasions.]\r\n\r\n--the \"Order of American Knights\" or \"Sons of Liberty,\" and other\r\nCopperhead organizations, tainted with more or less of Treason--they\r\nstirred up all the old dregs of Pro-Slavery feeling that could possibly\r\nhe reached; but while the venomous acts and utterances of such\r\norganizations, and the increased and vindictive energy of the armed\r\nRebels themselves, had a tendency to disquiet the public mind with\r\napprehensions as to the result of the Proclamation, and whether, indeed,\r\nMr. Lincoln himself would be able to resist the pressure, and stand up\r\nto his promise of that Supplemental Proclamation which would give\r\ndefiniteness and practical effect to the preliminary one, the masses of\r\nthe people of the Loyal States had faith in him.\r\n\r\nThere was also another element, in chains, at the South, which at this\r\ntime must have been trembling with that mysterious hope of coming\r\nEmancipation for their Race, conveyed so well in Whittier's lines,\r\ncommencing: \"We pray de Lord; he gib us signs, dat some day we be Free\"\r\n--a hope which had long animated them, as of something almost too good\r\nfor them to live to enjoy, but which, as the War progressed, appeared to\r\ngrow nearer and nearer, until now they seemed to see the promised Land,\r\nflowing with milk and honey, its beautiful hills and vales smiling under\r\nthe quickening beams of Freedom's glorious sun.  But ah! should they\r\nenter there?--or must they turn away again into the old wilderness of\r\ntheir Slavery, and this blessed Liberty, almost within their grasp,\r\nmockingly elude them?\r\n\r\nThey had not long to wait for an answer.  The 1st of January, 1863,\r\narrived, and with it--as a precious New Year's Gift--came the\r\nSupplemental Proclamation, bearing the sacred boon of Liberty to the\r\nEmancipated millions.\r\n\r\nAt last, at last, no American need blush to stand up and proclaim his\r\nland indeed, and in truth, \"the Land of Freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n                            THE ARMED-NEGRO.\r\n\r\nLittle over five months had passed, since the occurrence of the great\r\nevent in the history of the American Nation mentioned in the preceding\r\nChapter, before the Freed Negro, now bearing arms in defense of the\r\nUnion and of his own Freedom, demonstrated at the first attack on Port\r\nHudson the wisdom of emancipating and arming the Slave, as a War\r\nmeasure.  He seemed thoroughly to appreciate and enter into the spirit\r\nof the words; \"who would be Free, himself must strike the blow.\"\r\n\r\nAt the attack (of May 27th, 1863), on Port Hudson, where it held the\r\nright, the \"Black Brigade\" covered itself with glory.\r\n\r\n     At Baton Rouge, before starting for Port Hudson, the color-guard of\r\n     the First Louisiana Regiment--of the Black Brigade--received the\r\n     Regimental flags from their white colonel, (Col. Stafford,) then\r\n     under arrest, in a speech which ended with the injunction:\r\n     \"Color-guard, protect, defend, die for, but do not surrender these\r\n     flags;\" to which Sergeant Planciancois replied: \"Colonel, I will\r\n     bring these colors to you in honor, or report to God the reason\r\n     why!\"  He fell, mortally wounded, in one of the many desperate\r\n     charges at Port Hudson, with his face to the Enemy, and the colors\r\n     in his hand.\r\n\r\nBanks, in his Report, speaking of the Colored regiments, said: \"Their\r\nconduct was heroic.  No troops could be more determined or more daring.\r\nThey made, during the day, three charges upon the batteries of the\r\nEnemy, suffering very heavy losses, and holding their positions at\r\nnightfall with the other troops on the right of our line.  The highest\r\ncommendation is bestowed upon them by all the officers in command on the\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York Times' correspondent said:--\"The deeds of heroism performed\r\nby these Colored men were such as the proudest White men might emulate.\r\nTheir colors are torn to pieces by shot, and literally bespattered by\r\nblood and brains.  The color-sergeant of the 1st Louisiana, on being\r\nmortally wounded (the top of his head taken off by a sixpounder), hugged\r\nthe colors to his breast, when a struggle ensued between the two\r\ncolor-corporals on each side of him, as to who should have the honor of\r\nbearing the sacred standard, and during this generous contention one was\r\nseriously wounded.\"\r\n\r\nSo again, on Sunday the 6th of June following, at Milliken's Bend, where\r\nan African brigade, with 160 men of the 23rd Iowa, although surprised in\r\ncamp by a largely superior force of the Enemy, repulsed him gallantly\r\n--of which action General Grant, in his official Report, said: \"In this\r\nbattle, most of the troops engaged were Africans, who had but little\r\nexperience in the use of fire-arms.  Their conduct is said, however, to\r\nhave been most gallant.\"\r\n\r\nSo, also, in the bloody assault of July 18th, on Fort Wagner, which was\r\nled by the 54th Massachusetts (Colored) Regiment with intrepidity, and\r\nwhere they planted, and for some time maintained, their Country's flag\r\non the parapet, until they \"melted away before the Enemy's fire, their\r\nbodies falling down the slope and into the ditch.\"\r\n\r\nAnd from that time on, through the War--at Wilson's Wharf, in the many\r\nbloody charges at Petersburg, at Deep Bottom, at Chapin's Farm, Fair\r\nOaks, and numerous other battle-fields, in Virginia and elsewhere, right\r\ndown to Appomattox--the African soldier fought courageously, fully\r\nvindicating the War-wisdom of Abraham Lincoln in emancipating and arming\r\nthe Race.\r\n\r\nThe promulgation of this New Year's Proclamation of Freedom\r\nunquestionably had a wonderful effect in various ways, upon the outcome\r\nof the War.\r\n\r\nIt cleared away the cobwebs which the arguments of the loyal\r\nBorder-State men, and of the Northern Copperheads and other Disunion\r\nand Pro-Slavery allies of the Rebels were forever weaving for the\r\ndiscouragement, perplexity and ensnarement, of the thoroughly loyal\r\nout-and-out Union men of the Land.  It largely increased our strength in\r\nfighting material.  It brought to us the moral support of the World,\r\nwith the active sympathy of philanthropy's various forces.  And besides,\r\nit correspondingly weakened the Rebels.  Every man thus freed from his\r\nBondage, and mustered into the Union Armies, was not only a gain of one\r\nman on the Union side, but a loss of one man to the Enemy.  It is not,\r\ntherefore, surprising that the Disunion Conspirators--whether at the\r\nSouth or at the North--were furious.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Conspirator, Jefferson Davis, had already, (December 23,\r\n1862,) issued a proclamation of outlawry against General B. F. Butler,\r\nfor arming certain Slaves that had become Free upon entering his lines\r\n--the two last clauses of which provided: \"That all Negro Slaves captured\r\nin arms, be at once delivered over to the Executive authorities of the\r\nrespective States to which they belong, to be dealt with according to\r\nthe laws of said States,\" and \"That the like orders be executed in all\r\ncases with respect to all commissioned Officers of the United States,\r\nwhen found serving in company with said Slaves in insurrection against\r\nthe authorities of the different States of this Confederacy.\"\r\n\r\nHe now called the attention of the Rebel Congress to President Lincoln's\r\ntwo Proclamations of Emancipation, early in January of 1863; and that\r\nBody responded by adopting, on the 1st of May of that year, a\r\nResolution, the character of which was so cold-bloodedly atrocious, that\r\nmodern Civilization might well wonder and Christianity shudder at its\r\npurport.\r\n\r\n     [It was in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"Resolved, by the Congress of the Confederate States of America, In\r\n     response to the Message of the President, transmitted to Congress\r\n     at the commencement of the present session, That, in the opinion of\r\n     Congress, the commissioned officers of the Enemy ought not to be\r\n     delivered to the authorities of the respective States, as suggested\r\n     in the said Message, but all captives taken by the Confederate\r\n     forces ought to be dealt with and disposed of by the Confederate\r\n     Government.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2.--That, in the judgment of Congress, the proclamations of\r\n     the President of the United States, dated respectively September\r\n     22, 1862, and January 1, 1863, and the other measures of the\r\n     Government of the United States and of its authorities, commanders,\r\n     and forces, designed or tending to emancipate slaves in the\r\n     Confederate States, or to abduct such slaves, or to incite them to\r\n     insurrection, or to employ negroes in war against the Confederate\r\n     States, or to overthrow the institution of African Slavery, and\r\n     bring on a servile war in these States, would, if successful,\r\n     produce atrocious consequences, and they are inconsistent with the\r\n     spirit of those usages which, in modern warfare, prevail among\r\n     civilized nations; they may, therefore, be properly and lawfully\r\n     repressed by retaliation.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3.--That in every case wherein, during the present war, any\r\n     violation of the laws or usages of war among civilized nations\r\n     shall be, or has been, done and perpetrated by those acting under\r\n     authority of the Government of the United States, on persons or\r\n     property of citizens of the Confederate States, or of those under\r\n     the protection or in the land or naval service of the Confederate\r\n     States, or of any State of the Confederacy, the President of the\r\n     Confederate States is hereby authorized to cause full and ample\r\n     retaliation to be made for every such violation, in such manner and\r\n     to such extent as he may think proper.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4.--That every white person, being a commissioned officer, or\r\n     acting as such, who, during the present war, shall command negroes\r\n     or mulattoes in arms against the Confederate States, or who shall\r\n     arm, train, organize, or prepare negroes or mulattoes for military\r\n     service against the Confederate States, or who shall voluntarily\r\n     aid negroes or mulattoes in any military enterprise, attack, or\r\n     conflict in such service, shall be deemed as inciting servile\r\n     insurrection, and shall, if captured, be put to death, or be\r\n     otherwise punished at the discretion of the Court.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5.--Every person, being a commissioned officer, or acting as\r\n     such in the service of the Enemy, who shall, during the present\r\n     war, excite, attempt to excite, or cause to be excited, a servile\r\n     insurrection, or who shall incite, or cause to be incited, a slave\r\n     to rebel, shall, if captured, be put to death, or be otherwise\r\n     punished at the discretion of the court.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 6.--Every person charged with an offense punishable under the\r\n     preceding resolutions shall, during the present war, be tried\r\n     before the military court attached to the army or corps by the\r\n     troops of which he shall have been captured, or by such other\r\n     military court as the President may direct, and in such manner and\r\n     under such regulations as the President shall prescribe;

and for every one Enslaved by the Enemy or sold\r\n     into Slavery, a Rebel soldier shall be placed at hard work on the\r\n     public works, and continued at such labor until the other shall be\r\n     released and receive the treatment due to a prisoner of War.\r\n\r\n     \"By order of the Secretary of War.  ABRAHAM LINCOLN.  E. D.\r\n     TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.\"]\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that the mere announcement of the decision of our\r\nGovernment to retaliate, would put an instant stop to the barbarous\r\nconduct of the Rebels toward the captured Colored Union troops, but the\r\nhope was vain.  The atrocities continued, and their climax was capped by\r\nthe cold-blooded massacres perpetrated by Forrest's 5,000 Cavalry, after\r\ncapturing Fort Pillow, a short distance above Memphis, on the\r\nMississippi river.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of that Fort comprised less than 600 Union soldiers, about\r\none-half of whom were White, and the balance Black.  These brave fellows\r\ngallantly defended the Fort against eight times their number, from\r\nbefore sunrise until the afternoon, when--having failed to win by fair\r\nmeans, under the Laws of War,--the Enemy treacherously crept up the\r\nravines on either side of the Fort, under cover of flags of truce, and\r\nthen, with a sudden rush, carried it, butchering both Blacks and Whites\r\n--who had thrown away their arms, and were striving to escape--until\r\nnight temporarily put an end to the sanguinary tragedy.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning the massacre was completed by the butchery and\r\ntorture of wounded remnants of these brave Union defenders--some being\r\nburied alive, and others nailed to boards, and burned to death.\r\n\r\n     [For full account of these hideous atrocities, see testimony of\r\n     survivors before the Committee on Conduct and Expenditures of the\r\n     War.  (H. R.  Report, No. 65, 1st S.  38th Cong.)]\r\n\r\nAnd all this murderous malignity, for what?--Simply, and only, because\r\none-half of the Patriot victims had Black skins, while the other half\r\nhad dared to fight by the side of the Blacks!\r\n\r\nIn the after-days of the War, the cry with which our Union Black\r\nregiments went into battle:--\"Remember Fort Pillow!\"--inspired them to\r\ndeeds of valor, and struck with terror the hearts of the Enemy.  On many\r\na bloody field, Fort Pillow was avenged.\r\n\r\nIt is a common error to suppose that the first arming of the Black man\r\nwas on the Union side.  The first Black volunteer company was a Rebel\r\none, raised  early in May, 1861, in the city of Memphis, Tenn.; and at\r\nCharleston, S. C., Lynchburg, Va., and Norfolk, Va., large bodies of\r\nFree Negroes volunteered, and were engaged, earlier than that, to do\r\nwork on the Rebel batteries.\r\n\r\nOn June 28th of the same year, the Rebel Legislature of Tennessee passed\r\nan Act not only authorizing the Governor \"to receive into the Military\r\nservice of the State all male Free persons of Color between the ages of\r\nfifteen and fifty, or such number as may be necessary, who may be sound\r\nin mind and body, and capable of actual service,\" but also prescribing\r\n\"That in the event a sufficient number of Free persons of Color to meet\r\nthe wants of the State shall not tender their services, the Governor is\r\nempowered, through the Sheriffs of the different counties, to press such\r\npersons until the requisite number is obtained.\"\r\n\r\nAt a review of Rebel troops, at New Orleans, November 23, 1861, \"One\r\nregiment comprised 1,400 Free Colored men.\"  Vast numbers of both Free\r\nNegroes and Slaves were employed to construct Rebel fortifications\r\nthroughout the War, in all the Rebel States.  And on the 17th of\r\nFebruary, 1864, the Rebel Congress passed an Act which provides in its\r\nfirst section \"That all male Free Negroes * * * resident in the\r\nConfederate States, between the ages of eighteen and fifty years, shall\r\nbe held liable to perform such duties with the Army, or in connection\r\nwith the Military defenses of the Country, in the way of work upon the\r\nfortifications, or in Government works for the production or preparation\r\nof materials of War, or in Military hospitals, as the Secretary of War\r\nor the Commanding General of the Trans-Mississippi Department may, from\r\ntime to time, prescribe:\" while the third section provides that when the\r\nSecretary of War shall \"be unable to procure the service of Slaves in\r\nany Military Department, then he is authorized to impress the services\r\nof as many male Slaves, not to exceed twenty thousand, as may be\r\nrequired, from time to time, to discharge the duties indicated in the\r\nfirst section of the Act.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this Act of, the Rebel Congress was passed only forty days before\r\nthe fiendish massacre of the Union Whites and Blacks who together, at\r\nFort Pillow, were performing for the Union, \"such duties with the Army,\"\r\nand \"in connection with the Military defenses of the Country,\" as had\r\nbeen prescribed for them by their Commanding General!\r\n\r\nUnder any circumstances--and especially under this state of facts\r\n--nothing could excuse or palliate that shocking and disgraceful and\r\nbarbarous crime against humanity; and the human mind is incapable of\r\nunderstanding how such savagery can be accounted for, except upon the\r\ntheory that \"He that nameth Rebellion nameth not a singular, or one only\r\nsin, as is theft, robbery, murder, and such like; but he nameth the\r\nwhole puddle and sink of all sins against God and man; against his\r\ncountry, his countrymen, his children, his kinsfolk, his friends, and\r\nagainst all men universally; all sins against God and all men heaped\r\ntogether, nameth he that nameth Rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nThe inconsistency of the Rebels, in getting insanely and murderously\r\nfurious over the arming of Negroes for the defense of the imperiled\r\nUnion and the newly gained liberties of the Black Race, when they had\r\nthemselves already armed some of them and made them fight to uphold the\r\nSlave-holders' Rebellion and the continued Enslavement of their race, is\r\nalready plain enough.\r\n\r\n     [The writer is indebted to the courtesy of a prominent South\r\n     Carolinian, for calling his attention to the \"Singular coincidence,\r\n     that a South Carolinian should have proposed in 1778, what was\r\n     executed in 1863-64--the arming of Negroes for achieving their\r\n     Freedom\"--as shown in the following very curious and interesting\r\n     letters written by the brave and gifted Colonel John Laurens, of\r\n     Washington's staff, to his distinguished father:\r\n\r\n                         HEAD QUARTERS, 14th Jan., 1778.\r\n\r\n     I barely hinted to you, my dearest father, my desire to augment the\r\n     Continental forces from an untried source.  I wish I had any\r\n     foundation to ask for an extraordinary addition to those favours\r\n     which I have already received from you.  I would solicit you to\r\n     cede me a number of your able bodied men slaves, instead of leaving\r\n     me a fortune.\r\n\r\n     I would bring about a two-fold good; first I would advance those\r\n     who are unjustly deprived of the rights of mankind to a state which\r\n     would be a proper gradation between abject slavery and perfect\r\n     liberty, and besides I would reinforce the defenders of liberty\r\n     with a number of gallant soldiers.  Men, who have the habit of\r\n     subordination almost indelibly impressed on them, would have one\r\n     very essential qualification of soldiers.  I am persuaded that if I\r\n     could obtain authority for the purpose, I would have a corps of\r\n     such men trained, uniformly clad, equip'd and ready in every\r\n     respect to act at the opening of the next campaign.  The ridicule\r\n     that may be thrown on the color, I despise, because I am sure of\r\n     rendering essential service to my country.\r\n\r\n     I am tired of the languor with which so sacred a war as this is\r\n     carried on.  My circumstances prevent me from writing so long a\r\n     letter as I expected and wish'd to have done on a subject which I\r\n     have much at heart.  I entreat you to give a favorable answer to\r\n                    Your most affectionate\r\n                                   JOHN LAURENS.\r\n\r\n     The Honble Henry Laurens Esq.\r\n     President of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HEAD QUARTERS, 2nd Feb., 1778.\r\n\r\n     My Dear Father:\r\n\r\n     The more I reflect upon the difficulties and delays which are\r\n     likely to attend the completing our Continental regiments, the more\r\n     anxiously is my mind bent upon the scheme, which I lately\r\n     communicated to you.  The obstacles to the execution of it had\r\n     presented themselves to me, but by no means appeared\r\n     insurmountable.  I was aware of having that monstrous popular\r\n     prejudice, open-mouthed against me, of undertaking to transform\r\n     beings almost irrational, into well disciplined soldiers, of being\r\n     obliged to combat the arguments, and perhaps the intrigues, of\r\n     interested persons.  But zeal for the public service, and an ardent\r\n     desire to assert the rights of humanity, determined me to engage in\r\n     this arduous business, with the sanction of your consent.  My own\r\n     perseverance, aided by the countenance of a few virtuous men, will,\r\n     I hope, enable me to accomplish it.\r\n\r\n     You seem to think, my dear father, that men reconciled by long\r\n     habit to the miseries of their condition, would prefer their\r\n     ignominious bonds to the untasted sweets of liberty, especially\r\n     when offer'd upon the terms which I propose.\r\n\r\n     I confess, indeed, that the minds of this unhappy species must be\r\n     debased by a servitude, from which they can hope for no relief but\r\n     death, and that every motive to action but fear, must be nearly\r\n     extinguished in them.  But do you think they are so perfectly\r\n     moulded to their state as to be insensible that a better exists?\r\n     Will the galling comparison between themselves and their masters\r\n     leave them unenlightened in this respect?  Can their self love be\r\n     so totally annihilated as not frequently to induce ardent wishes\r\n     for a change?\r\n\r\n     You will accuse me, perhaps, my dearest friend, of consulting my\r\n     own feelings too much; but I am tempted to believe that this\r\n     trampled people have so much human left in them, as to be capable\r\n     of aspiring to the rights of men by noble exertions, if some friend\r\n     to mankind would point the road, and give them a prospect of\r\n     success.  If I am mistaken in this, I would avail myself, even of\r\n     their weakness, and, conquering one fear by another, produce equal\r\n     good to the public.  You will ask in this view, how do you consult\r\n     the benefit of the slaves?  I answer, that like other men, they are\r\n     creatures of habit.  Their cowardly ideas will be gradually\r\n     effaced, and they will be modified anew.  Their being rescued from\r\n     a state of perpetual humiliation, and being advanced as it were, in\r\n     the scale of being, will compensate the dangers incident to their\r\n     new state.\r\n\r\n     The hope that will spring in each man's mind, respecting his own\r\n     escape, will prevent his being miserable.  Those who fall in battle\r\n     will not lose much; those who survive will obtain their reward.\r\n     Habits of subordination, patience under fatigues, sufferings and\r\n     privations of every kind, are soldierly qualifications, which these\r\n     men possess in an eminent degree.\r\n\r\n     Upon the whole, my dearest friend and father, I hope that my plan\r\n     for serving my country and the oppressed negro race will not appear\r\n     to you the chimera of a young mind, deceived by a false appearance\r\n     of moral beauty, but a laudable sacrifice of private interest, to\r\n     justice and the public good.\r\n\r\n     You say, that my resources would be small, on account of the\r\n     proportion of women and children.  I do not know whether I am\r\n     right, for I speak from impulse, and have not reasoned upon the\r\n     matter.  I say, altho' my plan is at once to give freedom to the\r\n     negroes, and gain soldiers to the states; in case of concurrence, I\r\n     should sacrifice the former interest, and therefore we change the\r\n     women and children for able-bodied men.  The more of these I could\r\n     obtain, the better; but forty might be a good foundation to begin\r\n     upon.\r\n\r\n     It is a pity that some such plan as I propose could not be more\r\n     extensively executed by public authority.  A well-chosen body of\r\n     5,000 black men, properly officer'd, to act as light troops, in\r\n     addition to our present establishment, might give us decisive\r\n     success in the next campaign.\r\n\r\n     I have long deplored the wretched state of these men, and\r\n     considered in their history, the bloody wars excited in Africa, to\r\n     furnish America with slaves--the groans of despairing multitudes,\r\n     toiling for the luxuries of merciless tyrants.\r\n\r\n     I have had the pleasure of conversing with you, sometimes, upon the\r\n     means of restoring them to their rights.  When can it be better\r\n     done, than when their enfranchisement may be made conducive to the\r\n     public good, and be modified, as not to overpower their weak minds?\r\n\r\n     You ask, what is the general's opinion, upon this subject?  He is\r\n     convinced, that the numerous tribes of blacks in the southern parts\r\n     of the continent, offer a resource to us that should not be\r\n     neglected.  With respect to my particular plan, he only objects to\r\n     it, with the arguments of pity for a man who would be less rich\r\n     than he might be.\r\n\r\n     I am obliged, my dearest friend and father, to take my leave for\r\n     the present; you will excuse whatever exceptionable may have\r\n     escaped in the course of my letter, and accept the assurance of\r\n     filial love, and respect of\r\n                         Your\r\n                              JOHN LAURENS]\r\n\r\nIf, however, it be objected that the arming of Negroes by the Rebels was\r\nexceptional and local, and, that otherwise, the Rebels always used their\r\nvolunteer or impressed Negro forces in work upon fortifications and\r\nother unarmed Military Works, and never proposed using them in the clash\r\nof arms, as armed soldiers against armed White men, the contrary is\r\neasily proven.\r\n\r\nIn a message to the Rebel Congress, November 7, 1864, Jefferson Davis\r\nhimself, while dissenting at that time from the policy, advanced by\r\nmany, of \"a general levy and arming of the Slaves, for the duty of\r\nsoldiers,\" none the less declared that \"should the alternative ever be\r\npresented of subjugation, or of the employment of the Slave as a\r\nsoldier, there seems no reason to doubt what should then be our\r\ndecision.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, he recommended the employment of forty\r\nthousand Slaves as pioneer and engineer laborers, on the ground that\r\n\"even this limited number, by their preparatory training in intermediate\r\nduties Would form a more valuable reserve force in case of urgency, than\r\nthreefold their number suddenly called from field labor; while a fresh\r\nlevy could, to a certain extent, supply their places in the special\r\nservice\" of pioneer and engineer work; and he undertook to justify the\r\ninconsistency between his present recommendation, and his past attitude,\r\nby declaring that \"A broad, moral distinction exists between the use of\r\nSlaves as soldiers in defense of their homes, and the incitement of the\r\nsame persons to insurrection against their masters, for,\" said he, \"the\r\none is justifiable, if necessary; the other is iniquitous and unworthy\r\nof a civilized people.\"\r\n\r\nSo also, while a Bill for the arming of Slaves was pending before the\r\nRebel Congress early in 1865, General Robert E. Lee wrote, February\r\n18th, from the Headquarters of the Rebel Armies, to Hon. E. Barksdale,\r\nof the Rebel House of Representatives, a communication, in which, after\r\nacknowledging the receipt of a letter from him of February 12th, \"with\r\nreference to the employment of Negroes as soldiers,\" he said: \"I think\r\nthe Measure not only expedient but necessary * * * in my opinion, the\r\nNegroes, under proper circumstances, will make efficient soldiers.  * *\r\n*  I think those who are employed, should be freed.  It would be neither\r\njust nor wise, in my opinion, to require them to remain as Slaves\"\r\n--thus, not only approving the employment of Black Slaves as soldiers, to\r\nfight White Union men, but justifying their Emancipation as a reward for\r\nMilitary service.  And, a few days afterward, that Rebel Congress passed\r\na Bill authorizing Jefferson Davis to take into the Rebel Army as many\r\nNegro Slaves \"as he may deem expedient, for and during the War, to\r\nperform Military service in whatever capacity he may direct,\" and at the\r\nsame time authorizing General Lee to organize them as other \"troops\" are\r\norganized.\r\n\r\n     [This Negro soldier Bill, according to McPherson's Appendix, p.\r\n     611-612, passed both Houses, and was in these words:\r\n\r\n     A Bill to increase the Military Forces of the Confederate States.\r\n\r\n     \"The Congress of the Confederate States of America do Enact, That\r\n     in order to provide additional forces to repel invasion, maintain\r\n     the rightful possession of the Confederate States, secure their\r\n     Independence and preserve their Institutions, the President be and\r\n     he is hereby authorized to ask for and accept from the owners of\r\n     Slaves the services of such number of able-bodied Negro men as he\r\n     may deem expedient for and during the War, to perform Military\r\n     service in whatever capacity he may direct.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 2.--That the General-in-Chief be authorized to organize the\r\n     said Slaves into companies, battalions, regiments, and brigades,\r\n     under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of War may\r\n     prescribe, and to be commanded by such officers as the President\r\n     may appoint.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 3.--That, while employed in the Service, the said troops\r\n     shall receive the same rations, clothing, and compensation as are\r\n     allowed to other troops in the same branch of the Service.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 4.--That if, under the previous sections of this Act, the\r\n     President shall not be able to raise a sufficient number of troops\r\n     to prosecute the War successfully and maintain the Sovereignty of\r\n     the States, and the Independence of the Confederate States, then he\r\n     is hereby authorized to call on each State, whenever he thinks it\r\n     expedient, for her quota of 300,000 troops, in addition to those\r\n     subject to Military service, under existing laws, or so many\r\n     thereof as the President may deem necessary, to be raised from such\r\n     classes of the population, irrespective of color, in each State, as\r\n     the proper authorities thereof may determine: Provided, that not\r\n     more than 25 per cent. of the male Slaves, between the ages of 18\r\n     and 45, in any State, shall be called for under the provisions of\r\n     this Act.\r\n\r\n     \"SEC. 5.--That nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize\r\n     a change in the relation of said Slaves.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n                      FREEDOM'S SUN STILL RISING.\r\n\r\nAfter President Lincoln had issued his Proclamation of Emancipation, the\r\nfriends of Freedom clearly perceived--and none of them more clearly than\r\nhimself that until the incorporation of that great Act into the\r\nConstitution of the United States itself, there could be no real\r\nassurance of safety to the liberties of the emancipated; that unless\r\nthis were done there would be left, even after the suppression of the\r\nRebellion, a living spark of dissension which might at any time again be\r\nfanned into the flames of Civil War.\r\n\r\nHence, at all proper times, Mr. Lincoln favored and even\r\nurged Congressional action upon the subject.  It was not, however, until\r\nthe following year that definite action may be said to have commenced in\r\nCongress toward that end; and, as Congress was slow, he found it\r\nnecessary to say in his third Annual Message: \"while I remain in my\r\npresent position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation; nor shall I return to Slavery any person who\r\nis Free by the terms of that Proclamation, or by any of the Acts of\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, occurred the series of glorious\r\nUnion victories in the West, ending with the surrender to Grant's\r\ntriumphant Forces on the 4th of July, 1863, of Vicksburg--\"the Gibraltar\r\nof the West\"--with its Garrison, Army, and enormous quantities of arms\r\nand munitions of war; thus closing a brilliant and successful Campaign\r\nwith a blow which literally \"broke the back\" of the Rebellion; while,\r\nalmost simultaneously, July 1-3, the Union Forces of the East, under\r\nMeade, gained the great victory of Gettysburg, and, driving the hosts of\r\nLee from Pennsylvania, put a second and final end to Rebel invasion of\r\nNorthern soil; gaining it, on ground dedicated by President Lincoln,\r\nbefore that year had closed--as a place of sepulture for the\r\nPatriot-soldiers who there had fallen in a brief, touching and immortal\r\nAddress, which every American child should learn by heart, and every\r\nAmerican adult ponder deeply, as embodying the very essence of true\r\nRepublicanism.\r\n\r\n     [President Lincoln's Address, when the National Cemetery at\r\n     Gettysburg, Pa., was dedicated Nov.  19, 1863, was in these\r\n     memorable words:\r\n\r\n     \"Fourscore and seven years ago, our Fathers brought forth upon this\r\n     continent a new Nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the\r\n     proposition that all men are created equal.\r\n\r\n     \"Now we are engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether that\r\n     Nation, or any Nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long\r\n     endure.\r\n\r\n     \"We are met on a great battlefield of that War.  We have come here\r\n     to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for\r\n     those who here gave their lives that that Nation might live.\r\n\r\n     \"It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.\r\n\r\n     \"But in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate,\r\n     we can not hallow, this ground.  The brave men, living and dead,\r\n     who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our power to add\r\n     or detract.\r\n\r\n     \"The World will little note, nor long remember, what we say here;\r\n     but it can never forget what they did here.\r\n\r\n     \"It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the\r\n     unfinished work which they who fought here have, thus far, so nobly\r\n     advanced.\r\n\r\n     \"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task\r\n     remaining before us; that from these honored dead we take increased\r\n     devotion to that Cause for which they gave the last full measure of\r\n     devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not\r\n     have died in vain; that this Nation, under God, shall have a new\r\n     birth of Freedom; and that Government of the People, by the People,\r\n     and for the People, shall not perish front the Earth.\"]\r\n\r\nThat season of victory for the Union arms, coming, as it did, upon a\r\nseason of depression and doubtfulness, was doubly grateful to the loyal\r\nheart of the Nation.  Daylight seemed to be breaking at last.\r\nGettysburg had hurled back the Southern invader from our soil; and\r\nVicksburg, with the immediately resulting surrender of Port Hudson, had\r\nopened the Mississippi river from Cairo to the Gulf, and split the\r\nConfederacy in twain.\r\n\r\nBut it happened just about this time that, the enrollment of the whole\r\nMilitia of the United States (under the Act of March, 1863), having been\r\ncompleted, and a Draft for 300,000 men ordered to be made and executed,\r\nif by a subsequent time the quotas of the various States should not be\r\nfilled by volunteering, certain malcontents and Copperheads, inspired by\r\nagents and other friends of the Southern Conspirators, started and\r\nfomented, in the city of New York, a spirit of unreasoning opposition\r\nboth to voluntary enlistment, and conscription under the Draft, that\r\nfinally culminated, July 13th, in a terrible Riot, lasting several days,\r\nduring which that great metropolis was in the hands, and completely at\r\nthe mercy, of a brutal mob of Secession sympathizers, who made day and\r\nnight hideous with their drunken bellowings, terrorized everybody even\r\nsuspected of love for the Union, plundered and burned dwellings,\r\nincluding a Colored Orphan Asylum, and added to the crime of arson, that\r\nof murdering the mob-chased, terror-stricken Negroes, by hanging them to\r\nthe lamp-posts.\r\n\r\nThese Riots constituted a part of that \"Fire in the Rear\" with which the\r\nRebels and their Northern Democratic sympathizers had so frequently\r\nmenaced the Armies of the Union.\r\n\r\nAlluding to them, the N. Y.  Tribune on July 15th, while its office was\r\ninvested and threatened with attack and demolition, bravely said: \"They\r\nare, in purpose and in essence, a Diversion in favor of Jefferson Davis\r\nand Lee.  Listen to the yells of the mob and the harangues of its\r\nfavorite orators, and you will find them surcharged with 'Nigger,'\r\n'Abolition,' 'Black Republican,' denunciation of prominent Republicans,\r\nThe Tribune, etc. etc.--all very wide of the Draft and the exemption.\r\nHad the Abolitionists, instead of the Slaveholders, revolted, and\r\nundertaken to upset the Government and dissolve the Union, nine-tenths\r\nof these rioters would have eagerly volunteered to put them down.  It is\r\nthe fear, stimulated by the recent and glorious triumphs of the Union\r\nArms, that Slavery and the Rebellion must suffer, which is at the bottom\r\nof all this arson, devastation, robbery, and murder.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Governor, Seymour, by promising to \"have this Draft\r\nsuspended and stopped,\" did something toward quieting the Riots, but it\r\nwas not until the Army of the Potomac, now following Lee's retreat, was\r\nweakened by the sending of several regiments to New York that the\r\nDraft-rioting spirit, in that city, and to a less extent in other\r\ncities, was thoroughly cowed.\r\n\r\n     [In reply to Gov. Seymour's appeal for delay in the execution of\r\n     the Draft Law, in order to test its Constitutionality, Mr. Lincoln,\r\n     on the 7th of August, said he could not consent to lose the time\r\n     that would be involved in obtaining a decision from the U. S.\r\n     Supreme Court on that point, and proceeded: \"We are contending with\r\n     an Enemy who, as I understand, drives every able-bodied man he can\r\n     reach into his ranks, very much as a butcher drives bullocks into a\r\n     slaughter-pen.  No time is wasted, no argument is used.\r\n\r\n     \"This system produces an Army which will soon turn upon our now\r\n     victorious soldiers already in the field, if they shall not be\r\n     sustained by recruits as they should be.\r\n\r\n     It produces an Army with a rapidity not to be matched on our side,\r\n     if we first waste time to re-experiment with the Volunteer system,\r\n     already deemed by Congress, and palpably, in fact, so far exhausted\r\n     as to be inadequate; and then more time to obtain a Court decision\r\n     as to whether a law is Constitutional which requires a part of\r\n     those not now in the Service to go to those who are already in it,\r\n     and still more time to determine with absolute certainty that we\r\n     get those who are to go, in the precisely legal proportion to those\r\n     who are not to go.\r\n\r\n     \"My purpose is to be in my action Just and Constitutional, and yet\r\n     Practical, in performing the important duty with which I am\r\n     charged, of maintaining the Unity and the Free principles of our\r\n     common Country.\"]\r\n\r\nWorried and weakened by this Democratic opposition to the Draft, and the\r\nthreatened consequent delays and dangers to the success of the Union\r\nCause, and depressed moreover by the defeat of the National forces under\r\nRosecrans at Chickamauga; yet, the favorable determination of the Fall\r\nelections on the side of Union and Freedom, and the immense majorities\r\nupholding those issues, together with Grant's great victory (November,\r\n1863) of Chattanooga--where the three days of fighting in the\r\nChattanooga Valley and up among the clouds of Lookout Mountain and\r\nMission Ridge, not only effaced the memory of Rosecrans's previous\r\ndisaster, but brought fresh and imperishable laurels to the Union Arms\r\n--stiffened the President's backbone, and that of Union men everywhere.\r\n\r\nNot that Mr. Lincoln had shown any signs of weakness or wavering, or any\r\nloss of hope in the ultimate result of this War for the preservation of\r\nthe Union--which now also involved Freedom to all beneath its banner.\r\nOn the contrary, a letter of his written late in August shows\r\nconclusively enough that he even then began to see clearly the coming\r\nfinal triumph--not perhaps as \"speedy,\" as he would like, in its coming,\r\nbut none the less sure to come in God's \"own good time,\" and furthermore\r\nnot appearing \"to be so distant as it did\" before Gettysburg, and\r\nespecially Vicksburg, was won; for, said he: \"The signs look better.\r\nThe Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the Sea\".\r\n\r\n     [This admirable letter, reviewing \"the situation\" and his policy,\r\n     was in these words\r\n\r\n                         EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n                    WASHINGTON, August 26.  1863.\r\n\r\n     HON. JAMES C. CONKLING\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR; Your letter inviting me to attend a Mass Meeting of\r\n     unconditional Union men to be held at the Capital of Illinois, on\r\n     the 3rd day of September, has been received.  It would be very\r\n     agreeable for me thus to meet my old friends at my own home; but I\r\n     cannot just now be absent from here so long a time as a visit there\r\n     would require.\r\n\r\n     The meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional\r\n     devotion to the Union; and I am sure that my old political friends\r\n     will thank me for tendering, as I do, the Nation's gratitude to\r\n     those other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope can\r\n     make false to the Nation's life.\r\n\r\n     There are those who are dissatisfied with me.  To such I would say:\r\n     you desire Peace, and you blame me that we do not have it.  But how\r\n     can we attain it?  There are but three conceivable ways: First, to\r\n     suppress the Rebellion by force of Arms.  This I am trying to do.\r\n     Are you for it?  If you are, so far we are agreed.  If you are not\r\n     for it, a second way is to give up the Union.  I am against this.\r\n     Are you for it?  If you are, you should say so plainly.  If you are\r\n     not for Force, nor yet for Dissolution, there only remains some\r\n     imaginable Compromise.\r\n\r\n     I do not believe that any Compromise embracing the maintenance of\r\n     the Union is now possible.  All that I learn leads to a directly\r\n     opposite belief.  The strength of the Rebellion is its Military,\r\n     its Army.  That Army dominates all the Country, and all the people,\r\n     within its range.  Any offer of terms made by any man or men within\r\n     that range, in opposition to that Army, is simply nothing for the\r\n     present: because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce\r\n     their side of a Compromise, if one were made with them.\r\n\r\n     To illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South, and Peace men of\r\n     the North, get together in Convention, and frame and proclaim a\r\n     Compromise embracing a restoration of the Union.  In what way can\r\n     that Compromise be used to keep Lee's Army out of Pennsylvania?\r\n     Meade's Army can keep Lee's Army out of Pennsylvania, and, I think,\r\n     can ultimately drive it out of existence.  But no paper Compromise\r\n     to which the controllers of Lee's Army are not agreed, can at all\r\n     affect that Army.  In an effort at such Compromise we would waste\r\n     time, which the Enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and that\r\n     would be all.\r\n\r\n     A Compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who\r\n     control the Rebel Army, or with the people, first liberated from\r\n     the domination of that Army, by the success of our own Army.  Now,\r\n     allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that Rebel\r\n     Army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any\r\n     Peace Compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief.  All\r\n     charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and\r\n     groundless.  And I promise you that if any such proposition shall\r\n     hereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from\r\n     you.  I freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the People,\r\n     according to the bond of service, the United States Constitution;\r\n     and that, as such, I am responsible to them.\r\n\r\n     But, to be plain.  You are dissatisfied with me about the Negro.\r\n     Quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and\r\n     myself upon that subject.  I certainly wish that all men could be\r\n     Free, while you, I suppose, do not.  Yet I have neither adopted nor\r\n     proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your view,\r\n     provided that you are for the Union.  I suggested compensated\r\n     Emancipation; to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to\r\n     buy Negroes.  But I had not asked you to be taxed to buy Negroes,\r\n     except in such a way as to save you from greater taxation to save\r\n     the Union, exclusively by other means.\r\n\r\n     You dislike the Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps would have\r\n     it retracted.  You say it is Unconstitutional.  I think\r\n     differently.  I think the Constitution invests the\r\n     Commander-in-Chief with the Law of War in Time of War.  The most\r\n     that can be said, if so much, is, that Slaves are property.  Is\r\n     there, has there ever been, any question that, by the Law of War,\r\n     property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?\r\n     And is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the Enemy?\r\n     Armies, the World over, destroy enemies' property when they cannot\r\n     use it; and even destroy their own to keep it from the Enemy.\r\n     Civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or\r\n     hurt the Enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel.\r\n     Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and\r\n     non-combatants, male and female.\r\n\r\n     But the Proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not valid.  If\r\n     it is not valid, it needs no retraction.  If it is valid it cannot\r\n     be retracted, any more than the dead can be brought to life.  Some\r\n     of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably for\r\n     the Union.  Why better after the retraction than before the issue?\r\n     There was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the\r\n     Rebellion before the Proclamation was issued, the last one hundred\r\n     days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming,\r\n     unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance.\r\n     The War has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the\r\n     issue of the Proclamation as before.\r\n\r\n     I know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of\r\n     the Commanders of our Armies in the field, who have given us our\r\n     most important victories, believe the Emancipation policy and the\r\n     use of Colored troops constitute the heaviest blows yet dealt to\r\n     the Rebellion, and that at least one of those important successes\r\n     could not have been achieved when it was, but for the aid of Black\r\n     soldiers.\r\n\r\n     Among the Commanders who hold these views are some who have never\r\n     had an affinity with what is called \"Abolitionism,\" or with\r\n     \"Republican party politics,\" but who hold them purely as Military\r\n     opinions.  I submit their opinions as entitled to some weight\r\n     against the objections often urged that Emancipation and arming the\r\n     Blacks are unwise as Military measures, and were not adopted as\r\n     such, in good faith.\r\n\r\n     You say that you will not fight to Free Negroes.  Some of them seem\r\n     willing to fight for you; but no matter.  Fight you, then,\r\n     exclusively to save the Union.  I issued the Proclamation on\r\n     purpose to aid you in saving the Union.  Whenever you shall have\r\n     conquered all resistance to the Union, if I shall urge you to\r\n     continue fighting, it will be an apt time then for you to declare\r\n     you will not fight to Free Negroes.  I thought that in your\r\n     struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the Negroes should cease\r\n     helping the Enemy, to that extent it weakened the Enemy in his\r\n     resistance to you.  Do you think differently?  I thought whatever\r\n     Negroes can be got to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for\r\n     White soldiers to do in saving the Union.  Does it appear otherwise\r\n     to you?  But Negroes, like other people, act upon motives.  Why\r\n     should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them?  If\r\n     they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the\r\n     strongest motives, even the promise of Freedom.  And the promise,\r\n     being made, must be kept.\r\n\r\n     The signs look better.  The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to\r\n     the Sea.  Thanks to the great Northwest for it; nor yet wholly to\r\n     them.  Three hundred miles up, they met New England, Empire,\r\n     Keystone, and Jersey, hewing their way right and left.  The Sunny\r\n     South, too, in more colors than one, also lent a helping hand.  On\r\n     the spot, their part of the history was jotted down in Black and\r\n     White.  The job was a great National one, and let none be slighted\r\n     who bore an honorable part in it.  And while those who have cleared\r\n     the Great River may well be proud, even that is not all.  It is\r\n     hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than\r\n     at Antietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on many fields of less\r\n     note.  Nor must Uncle Sam's web-feet be forgotten.  At all the\r\n     watery margins they have been present, not only on the deep Sea,\r\n     the broad Bay, and the rapid River, but also up the narrow, muddy\r\n     Bayou, and wherever the ground was a little damp they had been, and\r\n     made their tracks.  Thanks to all.  For the Great Republic--for the\r\n     principle it lives by, and keeps alive--for Man's vast future\r\n     --thanks to all.\r\n\r\n     Peace does not appear so distant as it did.  I hope it will come\r\n     soon, and come to stay; and so come as to be worth the keeping in\r\n     all future time.  It will then have been proved that among Freemen\r\n     there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet,\r\n     and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose their case and\r\n     pay the cost.  And there will be some Black men who can remember\r\n     that, with silent tongue, and clinched teeth, and steady eye, and\r\n     well poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great\r\n     consummation, while I fear there will be some White ones unable to\r\n     forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they have\r\n     striven to hinder it.\r\n\r\n     Still, let us not be over sanguine of a speedy, final triumph.  Let\r\n     us be quite sober.  Let us diligently apply the means, never\r\n     doubting that a just God, in his own good time, will give us the\r\n     rightful result.\r\n\r\n                    Yours very truly,\r\n                                   A. LINCOLN.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Chattanooga, and the grand majorities in all the Fall\r\nState-elections, save that of New Jersey,--and especially the manner\r\nin which loyal Ohio sat down upon the chief Copperhead-Democrat and\r\nTreason-breeder of the North, Vallandigham--came most auspiciously to\r\nstrengthen the President's hands.\r\n\r\n     [The head of the Knights of the Golden Circle, and the Democratic\r\n     candidate for Governor of Ohio]\r\n\r\nAnd now he saw, more clearly still, the approach of that time when the\r\nsolemn promise and declaration of Emancipation might be recorded upon\r\nthe sacred roll of the Constitution, and thus be made safe for all time.\r\n\r\nIn his Annual Message of December, 1863, therefore, President Lincoln,\r\nafter adverting to the fact that \"a year ago the War had already lasted\r\nnearly twenty months,\" without much ground for hopefulness, proceeded to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\"The preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, issued in September, was\r\nrunning its assigned period to the beginning of the New Year.  A month\r\nlater the final Proclamation came, including the announcement that\r\nColored men of suitable condition would be received into the War\r\nservice.  The policy of Emancipation, and of employing Black soldiers,\r\ngave to the future a new aspect, about which hope, and fear, and doubt,\r\ncontended in uncertain conflict.\r\n\r\n\"According to our political system, as a matter of Civil Administration,\r\nthe General Government had no lawful power to effect Emancipation in any\r\nState, and for a long time it had been hoped that the Rebellion could be\r\nsuppressed without resorting to it as a Military measure.  It was all\r\nthe while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, and that\r\nif it should, the crisis of the contest would then be presented.  It\r\ncame, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and doubtful\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take another view\r\n* * * Of those who were Slaves at the beginning of the Rebellion, full\r\none hundred thousand are now in the United States Military service,\r\nabout one half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks; thus\r\ngiving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the Insurgent\r\ncause, and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so\r\nmany White men.  So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not\r\nas good soldiers as any.\r\n\r\n\"No servile insurrection, or tendency to violence or cruelty, has marked\r\nthe measures of Emancipation and arming the Blacks.  These measures have\r\nbeen much discussed in Foreign Countries, and contemporary with such\r\ndiscussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved.  At\r\nhome, the same measures have been fully discussed, supported,\r\ncriticised, and denounced, and the annual elections following are highly\r\nencouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the Country\r\nthrough this great trial.  Thus we have the new reckoning.  The crisis\r\nwhich threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past.\"\r\n\r\nAfter alluding to his Proclamation of Amnesty, issued simultaneously\r\nwith this Message, to all repentant Rebels who would take an oath\r\ntherein prescribed, and contending that such an oath should be (as he\r\nhad drawn it) to uphold not alone the Constitution and the Union, but\r\nthe Laws and Proclamations touching Slavery as well, President Lincoln\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment they have aided and will further aid, the Cause for\r\nwhich they were intended.  To now abandon them, would be not only to\r\nrelinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding\r\nbreach of faith.\"  And, toward the close of the Message, he added:\r\n\r\n\"The movements by State action, for Emancipation, in several of the\r\nStates not included in the Emancipation Proclamation, are matters of\r\nprofound gratulation.  And while I do not repeat in detail what I have\r\nheretofore so earnestly urged upon the subject, my general views remain\r\nunchanged; and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of\r\nAIDING THESE IMPORTANT STEPS TO A GREAT CONSUMMATION.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln's patient but persistent solicitude, his earnest and\r\nunintermitted efforts--exercised publicly through his Messages and\r\nspeeches, and privately upon Members of Congress who called upon, or\r\nwhose presence was requested by him at the White House--in behalf of\r\nincorporating Emancipation in the Constitution, were now to give\r\npromise, at least, of bearing good fruit.\r\n\r\nMeasures looking to this end were submitted in both Houses of Congress\r\nsoon after its meeting, and were referred to the respective Judiciary\r\nCommittees of the same, and on the 10th of February, 1864, Mr. Trumbull\r\nreported to the Senate, from the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which he\r\nwas Chairman, a substitute Joint Resolution providing for the submission\r\nto the States of an Amendment to the United States Constitution in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n\"ART. XIII., SEC. I.  Neither Slavery nor Involuntary Servitude, except\r\nas a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly\r\nconvicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to\r\ntheir jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\"SEC. II.  Congress shall have power to enforce this Article by\r\nappropriate legislation.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposed Amendment came up for consideration in the Senate, on the\r\n28th of March, and a notable debate ensued.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, in the House of Representatives, Thaddeus Stevens--with\r\nthe object perhaps of ascertaining the strength, in that Body, of the\r\nfriends of out-and-out Emancipation--offered a Resolution proposing to\r\nthe States the following Amendments to the United States Constitution:\r\n\r\n\"ART. I.  Slavery and Involuntary Servitude, except for the punishment\r\nof crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, is forever\r\nprohibited in the United States and all its Territories.\r\n\r\n\"ART. II.  So much of Article four, Section two, as refers to the\r\ndelivery up of Persons held to Service or Labor, escaping into another\r\nState, is annulled.\"\r\n\r\nThe test was made upon a motion to table the Resolution, which motion\r\nwas defeated by 38 yeas to 69 nays, and showed the necessity for\r\nconverting three members from the Opposition.  Subsequently, at the\r\ninstance of Mr. Stevens himself, the second Article of the Resolution\r\nwas struck out by 72 yeas to 26 nays.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings in both Houses of Congress upon these propositions to\r\nengraft upon the National Constitution a provision guaranteeing Freedom\r\nto all men upon our soil, were now interrupted by the death of one who\r\nwould almost have been willing to die twice over, if, by doing so, he\r\ncould have hastened their adoption.\r\n\r\nOwen Lovejoy, the life-long apostle of Abolitionism, the fervid\r\ngospeller of Emancipation, was dead; and it seemed almost the irony of\r\nFate that, at such a time, when Emancipation most needed all its friends\r\nto make it secure, its doughtiest champion should fall.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the eloquent tributes paid to his memory, in the Halls of\r\nCongress, helped the Cause no less.  They at least brought back to the\r\npublic mind the old and abhorrent tyrannies of the Southern Slave power;\r\nhow it had sought not not only to destroy freedom of Action, but freedom\r\nof Speech, and hesitated not to destroy human Life with these; reminded\r\nthe Loyal People of the Union of much that was hateful, from which they\r\nhad escaped; and strengthened the purpose of Patriots to fix in the\r\nchief corner-stone of the Constitution, imperishable muniments of human\r\nLiberty.\r\n\r\nLovejoy's brother had been murdered at Alton, Illinois, while\r\nvindicating freedom of Speech and of the Press; and the blood of that\r\nmartyr truly became \"the seed of the Church.\"  Arnold--recalling a\r\nspeech of Owen Lovejoy's at Chicago, and a passage in it, descriptive of\r\nthe martyrdom,--said to the House, on this sad occasion: \"I remember\r\nthat, after describing the scene of that death, in words--which stirred\r\nevery heart, he said he went a pilgrim to his brother's grave, and,\r\nkneeling upon the sod beneath which sleeps that brother, he swore, by\r\nthe everlasting God, eternal hostility to African Slavery.\"  And,\r\ncontinued Arnold, \"Well and nobly has he kept that oath.\"\r\n\r\nWashburne, too, reminded the House of the memorable episode in that very\r\nHall when, (April 5, 1860), the adherents of Slavery crowding around\r\nLovejoy with fierce imprecations and threats, seeking then and there to\r\nprevent Free Speech, \"he displayed that undaunted courage and matchless\r\nbearing which extorted the admiration of even his most deadly foes.\"\r\n\"His\"--continued the same speaker--\"was the eloquence of Mirabeau, which\r\nin the Tiers Etat and in the National Assembly made to totter the throne\r\nof France; it was the eloquence of Danton, who made all France to\r\ntremble from his tempestuous utterances in the National Convention.\r\nLike those apostles of the French Revolution, his eloquence could stir\r\nfrom the lowest depths all the passions of Man; but unlike them, he was\r\nas good and as pure as he was eloquent and brave, a noble minded\r\nChristian man, a lover of the whole human Race, and of universal Liberty\r\nregulated by Law.\"\r\n\r\nGrinnell, in his turn, told also with real pathos, of his having\r\nrecently seen Lovejoy in the chamber of sickness.  \"When,\" said\r\nGrinnell, \"I expressed fears for his recovery, I saw the tears course\r\ndown his manly cheek, as he said 'Ah! God's will be done, but I have\r\nbeen laboring, voting, and praying for twenty years that I might see the\r\ngreat day of Freedom which is so near and which I hope God will let me\r\nlive to rejoice in.  I want a vote on my Bill for the destruction of\r\nSlavery, root and branch.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Sumner, afterward speaking of Lovejoy and this Measure, said: \"On\r\n     the 14th of December, 1863, he introduced a Bill, whose title\r\n     discloses its character: 'A Bill to give effect to the Declaration\r\n     of Independence, and also to certain Provisions of the Constitution\r\n     of the United States.'  It proceeds to recite that All Men were\r\n     Created Equal, and were Endowed by the Creator with the Inalienable\r\n     Right to Life, Liberty and the Fruits of honest Toil; that the\r\n     Government of the United States was Instituted to Secure those\r\n     Rights; that the Constitution declares that No Person shall be\r\n     Deprived of Liberty without due Process of Law, and also provides\r\n     --article five, clause two--that this Constitution, and the Laws of\r\n     the United States made in pursuance thereof, shall be the Supreme\r\n     Law of the Land, and the Judges in each State shall be bound\r\n     thereby, anything in the Constitution and Laws of any State to the\r\n     contrary notwithstanding; that it is now demonstrated by the\r\n     Rebellion that Slavery is absolutely incompatible with the Union,\r\n     Peace, and General Welfare for which Congress is to Provide; and it\r\n     therefore Enacts that All Persons heretofore held in Slavery in any\r\n     of the States or Territories of the United States are declared\r\n     Freedmen, and are Forever Released from Slavery or Involuntary\r\n     Servitude except as Punishment for Crime on due conviction.  On the\r\n     same day he introduced another Bill to Protect Freedmen and to\r\n     Punish any one for Enslaving them.  These were among his last\r\n     Public acts,\"--Cong. Globe, 1st S., 38th C., Pt. 2, p.  1334]\r\n\r\nAnd staunch old Thaddeus Stevens said: \"The change to him, is great\r\ngain.  The only regret we can feel is that he did not live to see the\r\nsalvation of his Country; to see Peace and Union restored, and universal\r\nEmancipation given to his native land.  But such are the ways of\r\nProvidence.  Moses was not permitted to enter the Promised Land with\r\nthose he had led out of Bondage; he beheld it from afar off, and slept\r\nwith his fathers.\"  \"The deceased,\" he impressively added, \"needs no\r\nperishable monuments of brass or marble to perpetuate his name.  So long\r\nas the English language shall be spoken or deciphered, so long as\r\nLiberty shall have a worshipper, his name will be known!\"\r\n\r\nWhat influence the death of Owen Lovejoy may have had on the subsequent\r\nproceedings touching Emancipation interrupted as we have seen by his\r\ndemise--cannot be known; but among all the eloquent tributes to his\r\nmemory called forth by the mournful incident, perhaps none, could he\r\nhave heard it, would have better pleased him than those two opening\r\nsentences of Charles Summer's oration in the Senate--where he said of\r\nOwen Lovejoy: \"Could his wishes prevail, he would prefer much that\r\nSenators should continue in their seats and help to enact into Law some\r\none of the several Measures now pending to secure the obliteration of\r\nSlavery.  Such an Act would be more acceptable to him than any personal\r\ntribute,--\" unless it might be these other words, which followed from\r\nthe same lips: \"How his enfranchised Soul would be elevated even in\r\nthose Abodes to which he has been removed, to know that his voice was\r\nstill heard on Earth encouraging, exhorting, insisting that there should\r\nbe no hesitation anywhere in striking at Slavery; that this unpardonable\r\nwrong, from which alone the Rebellion draws its wicked life, must be\r\nblasted by Presidential proclamation, blasted by Act of Congress,\r\nblasted by Constitutional prohibition, blasted in every possible way, by\r\nevery available agency, and at every occurring opportunity, so that no\r\ntrace of the outrage may continue in the institutions of the Land, and\r\nespecially that its accursed foot-prints may no longer defile the\r\nNational Statute-book.  Sir, it will be in vain that you pass\r\nResolutions in tribute to him, if you neglect that Cause for which he\r\nlived, and do not hearken to his voice!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n                 \"THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT\" IN THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nDuring the great debate, which now opened in the Senate, upon the\r\nJudiciary Committee's substitute resolution for the Amendment of the\r\nConstitution, so as forever to prohibit Slavery within the United\r\nStates, and to empower Congress to pass such laws as would make that\r\nprohibition effective--participated in by Messrs. Trumbull, Wilson,\r\nSaulsbury, Davis, Harlan, Powell, Sherman, Clark, Hale, Hendricks,\r\nHenderson, Sumner, McDougall and others--the whole history of Slavery\r\nwas enquired into and laid bare.\r\n\r\nTrumbull insisted that Slavery was at the bottom of all the internal\r\ntroubles with which the Nation had from its birth been afflicted, down\r\nto this wicked Rebellion, with all the resulting \"distress, desolation,\r\nand death;\" and that by 1860, it had grown to such power and arrogance\r\nthat \"its advocates demanded the control of the Nation in\r\nits interests, failing in which, they attempted its overthrow.\"  He\r\nreviewed, at some length, what had been done by our Government with\r\nregard to Slavery, since the breaking out of hostilities against us in\r\nthat mad attempt against the National life; how, \"in the earlier stages\r\nof the War, there was an indisposition on the part of the Executive\r\nAuthority to interfere with Slavery at all;\" how, for a long time,\r\nSlaves, escaping to our lines, were driven back to their Rebel masters;\r\nhow the Act of Congress of July, 1861, which gave Freedom to all Slaves\r\nallowed by their Rebel masters to assist in the erection of Rebel works\r\nand fortifications, had \"not been executed,\" and, said Mr. Trumbull, \"so\r\nfar as I am advised, not a single Slave has been set at liberty under\r\nit;\" how, \"it was more than a year after its enactment before any\r\nconsiderable number of Persons of African descent were organized and\r\narmed\" under the subsequent law of December, 1861, which not only gave\r\nFreedom to all Slaves entering our Military lines, or who, belonging to\r\nRebel masters, were deserted by them, or were found in regions once\r\noccupied by Rebel forces and later by those of the Union, but also\r\nempowered the President to organize and arm them to aid in the\r\nsuppression of the Rebellion; how, it was not until this law had been\r\nenacted that Union officers ceased to expel Slaves coming within our\r\nlines--and then only when dismissal from the public service was made the\r\npenalty for such expulsion; how, by his Proclamations of Emancipation,\r\nof September, 1862, and January, 1863, the President undertook to\r\nsupplement Congressional action--which had, theretofore, been confined\r\nto freeing the Slaves of Rebels, and of such of these only as had come\r\nwithin the lines of our Military power-by also declaring, Free, the\r\nSlaves \"who were in regions of country from which the authority of the\r\nUnited States was expelled;\" and how, the \"force and effect\" of these\r\nProclamations were variously understood by the enemies and friends of\r\nthose measures--it being insisted on the one side that Emancipation as a\r\nWar-stroke was within the Constitutional War-power of the President as\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and that, by virtue of those Proclamations, \"all\r\nSlaves within the localities designated become ipso facto Free,\" and on\r\nthe other, that the Proclamations were \"issued without competent\r\nauthority,\" and had not effected and could not effect, \"the Emancipation\r\nof a single Slave,\" nor indeed could at any time, without additional\r\nlegislation, go farther than to liberate Slaves coming within the Union\r\nArmy lines.\r\n\r\nAfter demonstrating that \"any and all these laws and Proclamations,\r\ngiving to each the largest effect claimed by its friends, are\r\nineffectual to the destruction of Slavery,\" and protesting that some\r\nmore effectual method of getting rid of that Institution must be\r\nadopted, he declared, as his judgment, that \"the only effectual way of\r\nridding the Country of Slavery, so that it cannot be resuscitated, is by\r\nan Amendment of the Constitution forever prohibiting it within the\r\njurisdiction of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nHe then canvassed the chances of adoption of such an Amendment by an\r\naffirmative vote of two thirds in each House of Congress, and of its\r\nsubsequent ratification by three-fourths of the States of the Union, and\r\ndeclared that \"it is reasonable to suppose that if this proposed\r\nAmendment passes Congress, it will, within a year, receive the\r\nratification of the requisite number of States to make it a part of the\r\nConstitution.\"  His prediction proved correct--but only after a\r\nprotracted struggle.\r\n\r\nHenry Wilson also made a strong speech, but on different grounds.  He\r\nheld that the Emancipation Proclamations formed, together, a \"complete,\r\nabsolute, and final decree of Emancipation in Rebel States,\" and, being\r\n\"born of Military necessity\" and \"proclaimed by the Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the Army and Navy, is the settled and irrepealable Law of the\r\nRepublic, to be observed, obeyed, and enforced, by Army and Navy, and is\r\nthe irreversible voice of the Nation.\"\r\n\r\nHe also reviewed what had been done since the outbreak of the Rebellion,\r\nby Congress and the President, by Laws and Proclamations; and, while\r\nstanding by the Emancipation Proclamations, declared that \"the crowning\r\nAct, in this series of Acts, for the restriction and extinction of\r\nSlavery in America, is this proposed Amendment to the Constitution\r\nprohibiting the existence of Slavery in the Republic of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation, according to his view, only needed\r\nenforcement, to give \"Peace and Order, Freedom and Unity, to a now\r\ndistracted Country;\" but the \"crowning act\" of incorporating this\r\nAmendment into the Constitution would do even more than all this, in\r\nthat it would \"obliterate the last lingering vestiges of the Slave\r\nSystem; its chattelizing, degrading, and bloody codes; its malignant,\r\nbarbarizing spirit; all it was, and is; everything connected with it or\r\npertaining to it, from the face of the Nation it has scarred with moral\r\ndesolation, from the bosom of the Country it has reddened with the blood\r\nand strewn with the graves of patriotism.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the debate proceeded, President Lincoln watched it with careful\r\ninterest.  Other matters, however, had, since the Battle of Chattanooga,\r\nlargely engrossed his attention.\r\n\r\nThe right man had at last been found--it was believed--to control as\r\nwell as to lead our Armies.  That man was Ulysses S. Grant.  The grade\r\nof Lieutenant General of the Army of the United States--in desuetude\r\nsince the days of Washington, except by brevet, in the case of Winfield\r\nScott,--having been especially revived by Congress for and filled by the\r\nappointment and confirmation of Grant, March 2, 1864, that great soldier\r\nimmediately came on to Washington, received his commission at the hands\r\nof President Lincoln, in the cabinet chamber of the White House, on the\r\n9th, paid a flying visit to the Army of the Potomac, on the 10th, and at\r\nonce returned to Nashville to plan future movements.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, a General Order of the War Department (No.  98) was issued,\r\nrelieving Major-General Halleck, \"at his own request,\" from duty as\r\n\"General-in-Chief\" of the Army, and assigning Lieutenant-General U. S.\r\nGrant to \"the command of the Armies of the United States,\" \"the\r\nHeadquarters of the Army\" to be in Washington, and also with\r\nLieutenant-General Grant in the Field, Halleck being assigned to \"duty,\r\nin Washington, as Chief-of-staff of the Army, under the direction of the\r\nSecretary of War and the Lieutenant-General commanding.\"\r\n\r\nBy the same order, Sherman was assigned to the command of the \"Military\r\nDivision of the Mississippi,\" composed of the Departments of the Ohio,\r\nthe Cumberland, the Tennessee, and the Arkansas; and McPherson to that\r\nof the Department and Army of the Tennessee.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of March, Grant was back again at Washington, and at once\r\nproceeded to Culpepper Court-house, Virginia, where his Headquarters in\r\nthe field were, for a time, to be.\r\n\r\nHere he completed his plans, and reorganized his Forces, for the coming\r\nconflicts, in the South-west and South-east, which were to result in a\r\nfull triumph to the Union Arms, and Peace to a preserved Union.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the utterances of Mr. Lincoln when Vicksburg fell,\r\nthat he had then become pretty well satisfied that Grant was \"the coming\r\nman,\" to whom it would be safe to confide the management and chief\r\nleadership of our Armies.  Chattanooga merely confirmed that belief--as\r\nindeed it did that of Union men generally.  But the concurrent judgment\r\nof Congress and the President had now, as we have seen, placed Grant in\r\nthat chief command; and the consequent relief to Mr. Lincoln, in thus\r\nhaving the heavy responsibility of Army-control, long unwillingly\r\nexercised by him, taken from his own shoulders and placed upon those of\r\nthe one great soldier in whom he had learned to have implicit faith,--a\r\nfaith earned by steady and unvaryingly successful achievements in the\r\nField--must have been most grateful.\r\n\r\nOther responsibilities would still press heavily enough upon the\r\nPresident's time and attention.  Questions touching the Military and\r\nCivil government of regions of the Enemy's country, conquered by the\r\nUnion arms; of the rehabilitation or reconstruction of the Rebel States;\r\nof a thousand and one other matters, of greater or lesser perplexity,\r\ngrowing out of these and other questions; besides the ever pressing and\r\ngigantic problems involved in the raising of enormous levies of troops,\r\nand prodigious sums of money, needed in securing, moving, and supplying\r\nthem, and defraying the extraordinary expenses growing out of the\r\nnecessary blockade of thousands of miles of Southern Coast, and other\r\nNaval movements; not to speak of those expenditures belonging to the\r\nmore ordinary business transactions of the Government.\r\n\r\nBut chief of all things claiming his especial solicitude, as we have\r\nseen, was this question of Emancipation by Constitutional enactment, the\r\ndebate upon which was now proceeding in the Senate.  That solicitude was\r\nnecessarily increased by the bitter opposition to it of Northern\r\nCopperheads, and by the attitude of the Border-State men, upon whose\r\nfinal action, the triumph or defeat of this great measure must\r\nultimately depend.\r\n\r\nMany of the latter, were, as has already been shown in these pages,\r\nloyal men; but the loyalty of some of these to their Country, was still\r\nso questionably and so thoroughly tainted with their worshipful devotion\r\nto Slavery--although they must have been blind indeed not to have\r\ndiscovered, long ere this, that it was a \"slowly-dying cause\"--that they\r\nwere ever on the alert to delay, hamper, and defeat, any action, whether\r\nExecutive or Legislative, and however necessary for the preservation of\r\nthe Union and the overthrow of its mortal enemies, which, never so\r\nlightly, impinged upon their \"sacred Institution.\"\r\n\r\nThis fact was well set forth, in this very debate, by a Senator from New\r\nEngland--[Wilson of Massachusetts]--when, after adjuring the\r\nanti-Slavery men of the age, not to forget the long list of Slavery's\r\ncrimes, he eloquently proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Let them remember, too, that hundreds of thousands of our countrymen in\r\nLoyal States--since Slavery raised the banners of Insurrection, and sent\r\ndeath, wounds, sickness, and sorrow, into the homes of the People--have\r\nresisted, and still continue to resist, any measure for the defense of\r\nthe Nation, if that measure tended to impair the vital and animating\r\npowers of Slavery.  They resisted the Act making Free the Slaves used by\r\nRebels for Military purposes; the Confiscation of Rebel property and the\r\nFreedom of the Slaves of Rebel masters; the Abolition of Slavery in the\r\nCapital of the Nation, and the consecration of the Territories to Free\r\nLabor and Free laboring men; the Proclamation of Emancipation; the\r\nenlistment of Colored men to fight the battles of the Country; the\r\nFreedom of the Black soldier, who is fighting, bleeding, dying for the\r\nCountry; and the Freedom of his wife and children.  And now, when War\r\nhas for nearly three years menaced the life of the Nation, bathed the\r\nLand in blood, and filled two hundred thousand graves with our slain\r\nsons, these men of the Loyal States still cling to the falling fortunes\r\nof the relentless and unappeasable Enemy of their Country and its\r\ndemocratic institutions; they mourn, and will not be comforted, over the\r\nexpiring System, in the Border Slave-States; and, in tones of\r\nindignation or of anguish, they utter lamentations over the Proclamation\r\nof Emancipation, and the policy that is bringing Rebel States back again\r\nradiant with Freedom.\"\r\n\r\nAmong these \"loyal\" Democratic opponents of Emancipation, in any shape,\r\nor any where, were not wanting men--whether from Loyal Northern or\r\nBorder States--who still openly avowed that Slavery was right; that\r\nRebellion, to preserve its continuance, was justifiable; and that there\r\nwas no Constitutional method of uprooting it.\r\n\r\nSaulsbury of Delaware, was representative and spokesman of this class,\r\nand he took occasion during this very debate--[In the Senate, March 31,\r\n1864.]--to defend Slavery as a Divine Institution, which had the\r\nsanction both of the Mosaic and Christian Dispensations!\r\n\r\n     [Said he: \"Slavery had existed under some form or other from the\r\n     first period of recorded history.  It dates back even beyond the\r\n     period of Abraham, the Father of the Faithful, in whose seed all\r\n     the Nations of the Earth were to be blessed.  We find that,\r\n     immediately after the Flood, the Almighty, for purposes inscrutable\r\n     to us, condemned a whole race to Servitude: 'Vayomer Orur Knoan\r\n     Efet Afoatim Yeahio Le-echot:' 'And he said, Cursed be Canaan;\r\n     Slave of Slaves he shall be to his brethren.'  It continued among\r\n     all people until the advent of the Christian era.  It was\r\n     recognized in that New Dispensation, which was to supersede the\r\n     Old.  It has the sanction of God's own Apostle; for when Paul sent\r\n     back Onesimus to Philemon, whom did he send?  A Freeman?  No, Sir.\r\n     He sent his (doulos,) a Slave, born as such, not even his\r\n     andrapodon, who was such by captivity in War.  Among all people,\r\n     and in all ages, has this Institution, if such it is to be called,\r\n     existed, and had the countenance of wise and good men, and even of\r\n     the Christian Church itself, until these modern times, up at least\r\n     to the Nineteenth Century.  It exists in this Country, and has\r\n     existed from the beginning.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Harlan's reply to the position of Mr. Saulsbury that Slavery is\r\n     right, is a Divine Institution, etc., was very able and\r\n     interesting.  He piled up authority after authority, English as\r\n     well as American, to show that there is no support of Slavery--and\r\n     especially of the title to services of the adult offspring of a\r\n     Slave--at Common Law; and, after also proving, by the mouth of a\r\n     favorite son of Virginia, that it has no legal existence by virtue\r\n     of any Municipal or Statutory Law, he declared that the only\r\n     remaining Law that can be cited for its support is the Levitical\r\n     Code\"--as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"'Both thy Bondmen, and thy Bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall\r\n     be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy\r\n     Bondmen and Bondmaids.\r\n\r\n     \"'Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among\r\n     you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,\r\n     which they begat in your land; and they shall be your possession.\r\n\r\n     \"'And ye shall take them as an Inheritance for your children after\r\n     you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your Bondmen\r\n     forever.\"'\r\n\r\n     \"I remark,\" said he, \"in this connection, that the Levitical Code,\r\n     or the Hebrew Law, contains a provision for the Naturalization of\r\n     Foreigners, whether captives of War, or voluntary emigrants.  By\r\n     compliance with the requirements of this law they became citizens,\r\n     entitled to all the rights and privileges and immunities of native\r\n     Hebrews.  The Hebrew Slave Code, applicable to Enslaved Hebrews, is\r\n     in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"'And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold\r\n     unto thee, and serve thee six years, then in the seventh year thou\r\n     shalt let him go Free from thee.'\r\n\r\n     \"Here I request the attention of those who claim compensation for\r\n     Emancipated Slaves to the text:\r\n\r\n     \"'And when thou sendest him out Free from thee, thou shalt not let\r\n     him go away empty:\r\n\r\n     \"'Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy floor'--\r\n\r\n     \"Which means granaries--\r\n\r\n     \"'and out of thy wine-press: of that wherewith the Lord thy God\r\n     hath blessed thee, thou shalt give unto him.'\r\n\r\n     \"'It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away Free\r\n     from thee, for he hath been worth a double-hired servant to thee,\r\n     in serving thee six years.'\r\n\r\n     \"These Hebrew Statutes provide that the heathen might be purchased\r\n     and held as Slaves, and their posterity after them; that under\r\n     their Naturalization Laws all strangers and sojourners, Bond and\r\n     Free, have the privilege of acquiring the rights of citizenship;\r\n     that all Hebrews, natives or naturalized, might assert and maintain\r\n     their right to Freedom.\r\n\r\n     \"At the end of six years a Hebrew Slave thus demanding his Liberty,\r\n     was not to be sent away empty; the owner, so far from claiming\r\n     compensation from his neighbors or from the Public Treasury for\r\n     setting him Free, was bound to divide with the Freedman, of his own\r\n     possessions: to give him of his flocks, of his herds, of his\r\n     granary, and of his winepress, of everything with which the Lord\r\n     Almighty had blessed the master during the years of his Servitude;\r\n     and then the owner was admonished that he was not to regard it as a\r\n     hardship to be required to Liberate the Slave, and to divide with\r\n     him of his substance.\r\n\r\n     \"The Almighty places the Liberated Slave's claim to a division of\r\n     his former master's property on the eternal principles of Justice,\r\n     the duty to render an equivalent for an equivalent.  The Slave\r\n     having served six years must be paid for his Service, must be paid\r\n     liberally because he had been worth even more than a hired servant\r\n     during the period of his enslavement.\r\n\r\n     \"If, then,\" continued Mr. Harlan, \"the justice of this claim cannot\r\n     be found either in Reason, Natural Justice, or the principles of\r\n     the Common Law, or in any positive Municipal or Statute regulation\r\n     of any State, or in the Hebrew Code written by the Finger of God\r\n     protruded from the flame of fire on the summit of Sinai, I ask\r\n     whence the origin of the title to the services of the adult\r\n     offspring of the Slave mother?  or is it not manifest that there is\r\n     no just title?  Is it not a mere usurpation without any known mode\r\n     of justification, under any existing Code of Laws, human or\r\n     Divine?\"]\r\n\r\nHe also undertook to justify Secession on the singular ground that \"we\r\nare sprung from a Race of Secessionists,\" the proof of which he held to\r\nbe in the fact that, while the preamble to, as well as the body of the\r\nConvention of Ratification of, the old Articles of Confederation between\r\nthe States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and\r\nProvidence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia, declared that Confederation to be a \"Perpetual Union,\" yet,\r\nwithin nine years thereafter, all the other States Seceded from New\r\nYork, Virginia, North Carolina, and Rhode Island by ratifying the new\r\nConstitution for \"a more perfect Union.\"\r\n\r\nHe also endeavored to maintain the extraordinary proposition that \"if\r\nthe Senate of the United States were to adopt this Joint-resolution, and\r\nwere to submit it to all the States of this Union, and if three-fourths\r\nof the States should ratify the Amendment, it would not be binding on\r\nany State whose interest was affected by it, if that State protested\r\nagainst it!\"  And beyond all this, he re-echoed the old, old cry of the\r\nBorder-state men, that \"the time is unpropitious for such a measure as\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nReverdy Johnson, of Maryland, however, by his great speech, of April\r\n5th, in the Senate, did much to clear the tangle in the minds of some\r\nfaltering Union statesmen on this important subject.\r\n\r\nHe reviewed the question of human Slavery from the time when the\r\nConstitutional Convention was held; showed that at that period, as well\r\nas at the time of the Declaration of our Independence \"there was but one\r\nsentiment upon the subject among enlightened Southern statesmen\"--and\r\nthat was, that Slavery \"is a great affliction to any Country where it\r\nprevails;\" and declared that \"a prosperous and permanent Peace can never\r\nbe secured if the Institution is permitted to survive.\"\r\n\r\nHe then traversed the various methods by which statesmen were seeking to\r\nprevent that survival of Slavery, addressing himself by turns to the\r\narguments of those who, with John Sherman, \"seemed,\" said he, \"to\r\nconsider it as within the power of Congress by virtue of its Legislative\r\nauthority;\" to those of the \"many well-judging men, with the President\r\nat their head, who,\" to again use his own words, \"seem to suppose that\r\nit is within the reach of the Executive;\" and lastly, to those \"who\r\nexpress the opinion that it is not within the scope of either Executive\r\nor Legislative authority, or of Constitutional Amendment;\" and after\r\ndemolishing the arguments of those who held the two former of these\r\npositions, he proceeded to rebut the assumption that Slavery could not\r\nbe abolished at all because it was not originally abolished by the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nContinuing, he said: \"Remember, now, the question is, can that\r\nInstitution, which deals with Humanity as Property, which claims to\r\nshackle the mind, the soul, and the body, which brings to the level of\r\nthe brute a portion of the race of Man, cease to be within the reach of\r\nthe political power of the People of the United States, not because it\r\nwas not at one time within their power, but because at that time they\r\ndid not exert the power?\r\n\r\n\"What says the Preamble to the Constitution?  How pregnant with a\r\nconclusive answer is the Preamble, to the proposition that Slavery\r\ncannot be abolished!  What does that Preamble state to have been the\r\nchief objects that the great and wise and good men had at heart, in\r\nrecommending the Constitution, with that Preamble, to the adoption of\r\nthe American People?  That Justice might be established; that\r\nTranquillity might be preserved; that the common Defense and general\r\nWelfare might be maintained; and, last and chief of all, that Liberty\r\nmight be secured.\r\n\r\n\"Is there no Justice in putting an end to human Slavery?  Is there no\r\ndanger to the Tranquillity of the Country in its existence?  May it not\r\ninterfere with the common Defense and general Welfare?  And, above all,\r\nis it consistent with any notion, which the mind of man can conceive, of\r\nhuman Liberty?\"\r\n\r\nHe held that the very Amendatory clause of the Constitution under which\r\nit was proposed to make this Amendment, was probably inserted there from\r\na conviction of that coming time \"when Justice would call so loudly for\r\nthe extinction of the Institution that her call could not be disobeyed,\"\r\nand, when \"the Peace and Tranquillity of the Land would demand, in\r\nthunder tones,\" its destruction, \"as inconsistent with such Peace and\r\nTranquillity.\"\r\n\r\nTo the atrocious pretence that \"there was a right to make a Slave of any\r\nhuman being\"--which he said would have shocked every one of the framers\r\nof the Constitution had they heard it; and, what he termed, the nauseous\r\ndeclaration that \"Slavery of the Black race is of Divine origin,\" and\r\nwas intended to be perpetual; he said:\r\n\r\n\"The Saviour of Mankind did not put an end to it by physical power, or\r\nby the declaration of any existing illegality, in word.  His mission\r\nupon Earth was not to propagate His doctrines by force.  He came to\r\nsave, not to conquer.  His purpose was not to march armed legions\r\nthroughout the habitable Globe, securing the allegiance of those for\r\nwhose safety He was striving.  He warred by other influences.  He aimed\r\nat the heart, principally.  He inculcated his doctrines, more ennobling\r\nthan any that the World, enlightened as it was before His advent upon\r\nEarth, had been able to discover.  He taught to Man the obligation of\r\nbrotherhood.  He announced that the true duty of Man was to do to others\r\nas he would have others do to him--to all men, the World over; and\r\nunless some convert to the modern doctrine that Slavery itself finds not\r\nonly a guarantee for its existence, but for its legal existence, in the\r\nScripture, excepts from the operation of the influences which His\r\nmorality brought to bear on the mind of the Christian world, the Black\r\nman, and shows that it was not intended to apply to Black men, then it\r\nis not true, it cannot be true, that He designed His doctrine not to be\r\nequally applicable to the Black and to the White, to the Race of Man as\r\nhe then existed, or as he might exist in all after-time.\"\r\n\r\nTo the assumption that the African Slaves were too utterly deficient and\r\ndegraded, mentally and morally, to appreciate the blessings of Freedom,\r\nhe opposed the eloquent fact that \"wherever the flag of the United\r\nStates, the symbol of human Liberty, now goes; under it, from their\r\nhereditary bondage, are to be found men and women and children\r\nassembling and craving its protection 'fleeing from' the iron of\r\noppression that had pierced their souls, to the protection of that flag\r\nwhere they are 'gladdened by the light of Liberty.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It is idle to deny,\" said he--\"we feel it in our own persons--how, with\r\nreference to that sentiment, all men are brethren.  Look to the\r\nillustrations which the times now afford, how, in the illustration of\r\nthat sentiment, do we differ from the Black man?  He is willing to incur\r\nevery personal danger which promises to result in throwing down his\r\nshackles, and making him tread the Earth, which God has created for all,\r\nas a man, and not as a Slave.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"It is an instinct of the Soul.  Tyranny may oppress it for\r\nages and centuries; the pall of despotism may hang over it; but the\r\nsentiment is ever there; it kindles into a flame in the very furnace of\r\naffliction, and it avails itself of the first opportunity that offers,\r\npromising the least chance of escape, and wades through blood and\r\nslaughter to achieve it, and, whether it succeeds or fails,\r\ndemonstrates, vindicates in the very effort, the inextinguishable right\r\nto Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought that mischiefs might result from this measure, owing to the\r\nuneducated condition of the Slave, but they would be but temporary.  At\r\nall events to \"suffer those Africans,\" said he, \"whom we are calling\r\naround our standard, and asking to aid us in restoring the Constitution\r\nand the power of the Government to its rightful authority, to be reduced\r\nto bondage again,\" would be \"a disgrace to the Nation.\"  The\r\n\"Institution\" must be terminated.\r\n\r\n\"Terminate it,\" continued he, \"and the wit of man will, as I think, be\r\nunable to devise any other topic upon which we can be involved in a\r\nfratricidal strife.  God and nature, judging by the history of the past,\r\nintend us to be one.  Our unity is written in the mountains and the\r\nrivers, in which we all have an interest.  The very differences of\r\nclimate render each important to the other, and alike important.\r\n\r\n\"That mighty horde which, from time to time, have gone from the\r\nAtlantic, imbued with all the principles of human Freedom which animated\r\ntheir fathers in running the perils of the mighty Deep and seeking\r\nLiberty here, are now there; and as they have said, they will continue\r\nto say, until time shall be no more: 'We mean that the Government in\r\nfuture shall be, as it has been in the past--Once an exemplar of human\r\nFreedom, for the light and example of the World; illustrating in the\r\nblessings and the happiness it confers, the truth of the principles\r\nincorporated into the Declaration of Independence, that Life and Liberty\r\nare Man's inalienable right.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately the Democratic opposition, in the Senate, to\r\nthis measure, was too small in numbers to beat the proposed Amendment,\r\nbut by offering amendments to it, its enemies succeeded in delaying its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the 5th of April, an amendment, offered by Garrett Davis,\r\nwas acted upon.  It was to strike out all after the preamble of the\r\nXIIIth Article of Amendment to the Constitution, proposed by the\r\nJudiciary Committee, and insert the words:\r\n\r\n\"No Negro, or Person whose mother or grandmother is or was a Negro,\r\nshall be a citizen of the United States and be eligible to any Civil or\r\nMilitary office, or to any place of trust or profit under the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis's amendment was rejected by a vote of 5 yeas to 32 nays; when\r\nhe immediately moved to amend, by adding precisely the same words at the\r\nend of Section 1 of the proposed Article.  It was again rejected.  He\r\nthen moved to amend by adding to the said Section these words:\r\n\r\n\"But no Slave shall be entitled to his or her Freedom under this\r\nAmendment if resident at the time it takes effect in any State, the laws\r\nof which forbid Free Negroes to reside therein, until removed from such\r\nState by the Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThis also was rejected.  Whereupon Mr. Powell moved to add, at the end\r\nof the first Section, the words:\r\n\r\n\"No Slave shall be Emancipated by this Article unless the owner thereof\r\nshall be first paid the value of the Slave or Slaves so Emancipated.\"\r\n\r\nThis likewise was rejected, on a yea and nay vote, by 2 yeas (Davis and\r\nPowell) to 34 nays; when Mr. Davis moved another amendment, viz.: to add\r\nat the end of Section 2 of the proposed Article, the following:\r\n\r\n\"And when this Amendment of the Constitution shall have taken effect by\r\nFreeing the Slaves, Congress shall provide for the distribution and\r\nsettlement of all the population of African descent in the United States\r\namong the several States and Territories thereof, in proportion to the\r\nWhite population of each State and Territory to the aggregate population\r\nof those of African descent.\"\r\n\r\nThis met a like fate; whereupon the Senate adjourned, but, on the\r\nfollowing day, the matter came up again for consideration:\r\n\r\nHale, of New Hampshire, jubilantly declared that \"this is a day that I\r\nand many others have long wished for, long hoped for, long striven for.\r\n* * *  A day when the Nation is to commence its real life; or, if it is\r\nnot the day, it is the dawning of the day; the day is near at hand * * *\r\nwhen the American People are to wake up to the meaning of the sublime\r\ntruths which their fathers uttered years ago, and which have slumbered,\r\ndead-letters, upon the pages of our Constitution, of our Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and of our history.\"\r\n\r\nMcDougall, of California, on the other hand,--utterly regardless of the\r\ngrandly patriotic resolutions of the Legislature of his State, which had\r\njust been presented to the Senate by his colleague--lugubriously\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n\"In my judgment, it may well be said of us:\r\n\r\n               'Let the Heavens be hung in black\r\n               And let the Earth put mourning on,'\r\n\r\nfor in the history of no Free People, since the time the Persians came\r\ndown upon Athens, have I known as melancholy a period as this day and\r\nyear of Our Lord in our history; and if we can, by the blessing of God\r\nand by His favor, rise above it, it will be by His special providence,\r\nand by no act of ours.\"\r\n\r\nThe obstructive tactics were now resumed, Mr. Powell leading off by a\r\nmotion to amend, by adding to the Judiciary Committee's proposed\r\nThirteenth Article of the Constitution, the following:\r\n\r\n\"ART. 14.--The President and Vice-President shall hold their Offices for\r\nthe term of four--[Which he subsequently modified to: 'six years']\r\n--years.  The person who has filled the Office of President shall not be\r\nreeligible.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment was rejected by 12 yeas to 32 nays; whereupon Mr. Powell\r\nmoved to add to the Committee's Proposition another new Article, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"ART. 14.--The principal Officer in each of the Executive Departments,\r\nand all persons connected with the Diplomatic Service, may be removed\r\nfrom office at the pleasure of the President.  All other officers of the\r\nExecutive Departments may be removed at any time by the President or\r\nother appointing power when their services are unnecessary, or for\r\ndishonesty, incapacity, inefficiency, misconduct, or neglect of duty,\r\nand when so removed, the removal shall be reported to the Senate,\r\ntogether with the reasons therefor.\"\r\n\r\nThis amendment also being rejected, Mr. Powell offered another, which\r\nwas to add a separate Article as follows:\r\n\r\n\"ART. 14.--Every law, or Resolution having the force of law, shall\r\nrelate to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in its title.\"\r\n\r\nThis also being rejected--the negative vote being, as in other cases,\r\nwithout reference to the merits of the proposition--and Mr. Powell\r\nhaving now apparently exhausted his obstructive amendatory talents, Mr.\r\nDavis came to the aid of his Kentucky colleague by moving an amendment,\r\nto come in as an additional Article, being a new plan of Presidential\r\nelection designed to do away with the quadrennial Presidential campaign\r\nbefore the People by giving to each State the right to nominate one\r\ncandidate, and leaving it to a Convention of both Houses of Congress\r\n--and, in case of disagreement, to the Supreme Court of the United States\r\n--to elect a President and a Vice-President.\r\n\r\nThe rejection of this proposition apparently exhausted the stock of\r\npossible amendments possessed by the Democratic opposition, and the\r\nJoint Resolution, precisely as it came from the Judiciary Committee,\r\nhaving been agreed to by that body, \"as in Committee of the Whole,\" was\r\nnow, April 6th, reported to the Senate for its concurrence.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, Mr. Hendricks uttered a lengthy jeremiad on the\r\nWar, and its lamentable results; intimated that along the Mississippi,\r\nthe Negroes, freed by the advance of our invading Armies and Navies,\r\ninstead of being happy and industrious, were without protection or\r\nprovision and almost without clothing, while at least 200,000 of them\r\nhad prematurely perished, and that such was the fate reserved for the\r\n4,000,000 Negroes if liberated; and declared he would not vote for the\r\nResolution, \"because,\" said he, \"the times are not auspicious.\"\r\n\r\nVery different indeed was the attitude of Mr. Henderson, of Missouri,\r\nBorder-State man though he was.  In the course of a speech, of much\r\npower, which he opened with an allusion to the 115,000 Slaves owned in\r\nhis State in 1860--as showing how deeply interested Missouri \"must be in\r\nthe pending proposition\"--the Senator announced that: \"Our great\r\ninterest, as lovers of the Union, is in the preservation and\r\nperpetuation of the Union.\"  He declared himself a Slaveholder, yet none\r\nthe less desired the adoption of this Thirteenth Article of Amendment,\r\nfor, said he: \"We cannot save the Institution if we would.  We ought not\r\nif we could.  * * *  If it were a blessing, I, for one, would be\r\ndefending it to the last.  It is a curse, and not a blessing.  Therefore\r\nlet it go.  * * * Let the iniquity be cast away!\"\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that a remarkable letter written by Mr. Lincoln\r\nto a Kentuckian, on the subject of Emancipation, appeared in print.  It\r\nis interesting as being not alone the President's own statement of his\r\nviews, from the beginning, as to Slavery, and how he came to be \"driven\"\r\nto issue the Proclamation of Emancipation, and as showing how the Union\r\nCause had gained by its issue, but also in disclosing, indirectly, how\r\nincessantly the subject was revolved in his own mind, and urged by him\r\nupon the minds of others.  The publication of the letter, moreover, was\r\nnot without its effect on the ultimate action of the Congress and the\r\nStates in adopting the Thirteenth Amendment.  It ran thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"EXECUTIVE MANSION.\r\n                    \"WASHINGTON, April 4, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"A. G. HODGES, Esq., Frankfort, Ky.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR: You ask me to put in writing the substance of--what I\r\nverbally said the other day, in your presence, to Governor Bramlette and\r\nSenator Dixon.  It was about as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am naturally anti-Slavery.  If Slavery is not wrong, nothing is\r\nwrong.  I cannot remember when I did not so think and feel, and yet I\r\nhave never understood that the 'Presidency conferred upon me an\r\nunrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling.\r\n\r\n\"It was in the oath I took, that I would to the best of my ability\r\npreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.  I\r\ncould not take the Office without taking the oath.  Nor was it my view\r\nthat I might take an oath to get power, and break the oath in using the\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\"I understood, too, that in ordinary and Civil Administration this oath\r\neven forbade me to practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on\r\nthe moral question of Slavery.  I had publicly declared this many times,\r\nand in many ways.\r\n\r\n\"And I aver that, to this day, I have done no Official act in mere\r\ndeference to my abstract judgment and feeling on Slavery.\r\n\r\n\"I did understand, however, that my oath to preserve the Constitution to\r\nthe best of my ability, imposed upon me the duty of preserving by every\r\nindispensable means, that Government--that Nation, of which that\r\nConstitution was the Organic Law.\r\n\r\n\"Was it possible to lose the Nation and yet preserve the Constitution?\r\n\r\n\"By General Law, life and limb must be protected; yet often a limb must\r\nbe amputated to save a life; but a life is never wisely given to save a\r\nlimb.  I felt that measures, otherwise Unconstitutional, might become\r\nlawful, by becoming Indispensable to the Constitution through the\r\npreservation of the Nation.\r\n\r\n\"Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and now avow it.  I could not\r\nfeel that, to the best of my ability, I have even tried to preserve the\r\nConstitution, if, to save Slavery, or any minor matter, I should permit\r\nthe wreck of Government, Country, and Constitution, altogether.\r\n\r\n\"When, early in the War, General Fremont attempted Military\r\nEmancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then think it an\r\nIndispensable Necessity.\r\n\r\n\"When, a little later, General Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested\r\nthe Arming of the Blacks, I objected, because I did not yet think it an\r\nIndispensable Necessity.\r\n\r\n\"When, still later, General Hunter attempted Military Emancipation, I\r\nagain forbade it, because I did not yet think the Indispensable\r\nNecessity had come.\r\n\r\n\"When in March, and May, and July, 1862, I made earnest and successive\r\nappeals to the Border-States to favor compensated Emancipation, I\r\nbelieved the Indispensable Necessity for Military Emancipation and\r\narming the Blacks would come, unless averted by that measure.\r\n\r\n\"They declined the proposition, and I was, in my best judgment, driven\r\nto the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it, the\r\nConstitution, or of laying strong hand upon the Colored element.  I\r\nchose the latter.  In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss,\r\nbut of this I was not entirely confident.\r\n\r\n\"More than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our Foreign\r\nRelations, none in our home popular sentiment, none in our white\r\nMilitary force, no loss by it anyhow, or anywhere.  On the contrary, it\r\nshows a gain of quite a hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen,\r\nand laborers.\r\n\r\n\"These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be no\r\ncavilling.  We have the men; and we could not have had them without the\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n\"And now let any Union man who complains of this measure, test himself\r\nby writing down in one line, that he is for subduing the Rebellion by\r\nforce of arms; and in the next, that he is for taking one hundred and\r\nthirty thousand men from the Union side, and placing them where they\r\nwould be best for the measure he condemns.  If he cannot face his case\r\nso stated, it is only because he cannot face the truth.\r\n\r\n\"I add a word which was not in the verbal conversation.  In telling this\r\ntale, I attempt no compliment to my own sagacity.  I claim not to have\r\ncontrolled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me.\r\nNow at the end of three years' struggle, the Nation's condition is not\r\nwhat either Party, or any man, devised or expected.  God alone can claim\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Whither it is tending seems plain.  If God now wills the removal of a\r\ngreat wrong, and wills also that we of the North, as well as you of the\r\nSouth, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial\r\nhistory will find therein new causes to attest and revere the Justice\r\nand goodness of God.\r\n                    \"Yours truly,\r\n                              \"A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 8th of April (1864) turned out to be the decisive field-day in the\r\nSenate.  Sumner endeavored to close the debate on that day in a speech\r\nremarkable no less for its power and eloquence of statement, its\r\nstrength of Constitutional exposition, and its abounding evidences of\r\nextensive historical research and varied learning, than for its\r\npatriotic fervor and devotion to human Freedom.\r\n\r\nToward the end of that great speech, however, he somewhat weakened its\r\nforce by suggesting a change in the phraseology of the proposed\r\nThirteenth Amendment, so that, instead of almost precisely following the\r\nlanguage of the Jeffersonian Ordinance of 1787, as recommended by the\r\nJudiciary Committee of the Senate, it should read thus:\r\n\r\n\"All Persons are Equal before the Law, so that no person can hold\r\nanother as a Slave; and the Congress may make all laws necessary and\r\nproper to carry this Article into effect everywhere within the United\r\nStates and the jurisdiction thereof.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner's idea in antagonizing the Judiciary Committee's proposition\r\nwith this, was to introduce into our Organic Act, distinctive words\r\nasserting the \"Equality before the Law\" of all persons, as expressed in\r\nthe Constitutional Charters of Belgium, Italy and Greece, as well as in\r\nthe various Constitutions of France--beginning with that of September,\r\n1791, which declared (Art. 1) that \"Men are born and continue Free and\r\nEqual in Rights;\" continuing in that of June, 1793, which declares that\r\n\"All Men are Equal by Nature and before the Law:\" in that of June, 1814,\r\nwhich declares that \"Frenchmen are Equal before the Law, whatever may be\r\notherwise their title and ranks;\" and in the Constitutional Charter of\r\nAugust, 1830 in similar terms to the last.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said he, \"while desirous of seeing the great rule of Freedom\r\nwhich we are about to ordain, embodied in a text which shall be like the\r\nprecious casket to the more precious treasure, yet * * * I am consoled\r\nby the thought that the most homely text containing such a rule will be\r\nmore beautiful far than any words of poetry or eloquence, and that it\r\nwill endure to be read with gratitude when the rising dome of this\r\nCapitol, with the Statue of Liberty which surmounts it, has crumbled to\r\ndust.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner's great speech, however, by no means ended the debate.  It\r\nbrought Mr. Powell to his feet with a long and elaborate contention\r\nagainst the general proposition, in the course of which he took occasion\r\nto sneer at Sumner's \"most remarkable effort,\" as one of his \"long\r\nillogical rhapsodies on Slavery, like:\r\n\r\n                              '--a Tale\r\n               Told by an Idiot, full of sound and fury,\r\n               Signifying nothing.'\"\r\n\r\nHe professed that he wanted \"the Union to be restored with the\r\nConstitution as it is;\" that he verily believed the passage of this\r\nAmendment would be \"the most effective Disunion measure that could be\r\npassed by Congress\"--and, said he, \"As a lover of the Union I oppose\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n     [This phrase slightly altered, in words, but not in meaning, to\r\n     \"The Union as it was, and the Constitution as it is,\" afterward\r\n     became the Shibboleth under which the Democratic Party in the\r\n     Presidential Campaign of 1864, marched to defeat.]\r\n\r\nHe endeavored to impute the blame for the War, to the northern\r\nAbolitionists, for, said he: \"Had there been no Abolitionists, North,\r\nthere never would have been a Fire-eater, South,\"--apparently ignoring\r\nthe palpable fact that had there been no Slavery in the South, there\r\ncould have been no \"Abolitionists, North.\"\r\n\r\nHe heatedly denounced the \"fanatical gentlemen\" who desired the passage\r\nof this measure; declared they intended by its passage \"to destroy the\r\nInstitution of Slavery or to destroy the Union,\" and exclaimed: \"Pass\r\nthis Amendment and you make an impassable chasm, as if you were to put a\r\nlake of burning fire, between the adhering States and those who are out.\r\nYou will then have to make it a War of conquest and extermination before\r\nyou can ever bring them back under the flag of the Government.  There is\r\nno doubt about that proposition.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sumner, at this point, withdrew his proposed amendment, at the\r\nsuggestion of Mr. Howard, who expressed a preference \"to dismiss all\r\nreference to French Constitutions and French Codes, and go back to the\r\ngood old Anglo-Saxon language employed by our Fathers, in the Ordinance\r\nof 1787, (in) an expression adjudicated upon repeatedly, which is\r\nperfectly well understood both by the public and by Judicial Tribunals\r\n--a phrase, which is peculiarly near and dear to the people of the\r\nNorthwestern Territory, from whose soil Slavery was excluded by it.\"\r\n\r\n     [The following is the language of \"the Ordinance of 1787\" thus\r\n     referred to:\r\n\r\n     \"ART. 6.--There shall be neither Slavery nor Involuntary Servitude\r\n     in the said Territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes,\r\n     whereof the party shall have been duly convicted: * * *.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. Davis thereupon made another opposition speech and, at its\r\nconclusion, Mr. Saulsbury offered, as a substitute, an Article,\r\ncomprising no less than twenty sections--that, he said, \"embodied in\r\nthem some things\" which \"did not meet his personal approbation,\" but he\r\nhad consented to offer them to the Senate as \"a Compromise\"--as \"a Peace\r\noffering.\"\r\n\r\nThe Saulsbury substitute being voted down, the debate closed with a\r\nspeech by Mr. McDougall--an eloquent protest from his standpoint, in\r\nwhich, after endorsing the wild statement of Mr. Hendricks that 250,000\r\nof the people of African descent had been prematurely destroyed on the\r\nMississippi, he continued.\r\n\r\n\"This policy will ingulf them.  It is as simple a truth as has ever been\r\ntaught by any history.  The Slaves of ancient time were not the Slaves\r\nof a different Race.  The Romans compelled the Gaul and the Celt,\r\nbrought them to their own Country, and some of them became great poets,\r\nand some eloquent orators, and some accomplished wits, and they became\r\ncitizens of the Republic of Greece, and of the Republic of Rome, and of\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\n\"This is not the condition of these persons with whom we are now\r\nassociated, and about whose affairs we undertake to establish\r\nadministration.  They can never commingle with us.  It may not be within\r\nthe reading of some learned Senators, and yet it belongs to demonstrated\r\nScience, that the African race and the European are different; and I\r\nhere now say it as a fact established by science, that the eighth\r\ngeneration of the Mixed race formed by the union of the African and\r\nEuropean, cannot continue their species.  Quadroons have few children;\r\nwith Octoroons reproduction is impossible.\r\n\r\n\"It establishes as a law of nature that the African has no proper\r\nrelation to the European, Caucasian, blood.  I would have them kindly\r\ntreated.  * * *  Against all such policy and all such conduct I shall\r\nprotest as a man, in the name of humanity, and of law, and of truth, and\r\nof religion.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendment made, as in Committee of the Whole, having been concurred\r\nin, etc., the Joint Resolution, as originally reported by the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, was at last passed, (April 8th)--by a vote of 38 yeas to 6\r\nnays--Messrs.  Hendricks and McDougall having the unenviable distinction\r\nof being the only two Senators, (mis-)representing Free States, who\r\nvoted against this definitive Charter of American Liberty.\r\n\r\n     [The full Senate vote, on passing the Thirteenth Amendment, was:\r\n\r\n     YEAS-Messrs.  Anthony, Brown, Chandler, Clark, Collamer, Conness,\r\n     Cowan, Dixon, Doolittle, Fessenden, Foot, Foster, Grimes, Hale,\r\n     Harding, Harlan, Harris, Henderson, Howard, Howe, Johnson, Lane of\r\n     Indiana, Lane of Kansas, Morgan, Morrill, Nesmith, Pomeroy, Ramsey,\r\n     Sherman, Sprague, Sumner, Ten Eyck, Trumbull, Van Winkle, Wade,\r\n     Wilkinson, Willey, and Wilson--38.\r\n\r\n     NAYs--Messrs.  Davis, Hendricks, McDougall, Powell, Riddle, and\r\n     Saulsbury.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n                     TREASON IN THE NORTHERN CAMPS.\r\n\r\nThe immortal Charter of Freedom had, as we have seen, with comparative\r\nease, after a ten days' debate, by the power of numbers, run the\r\ngauntlet of the Senate; but now it was to be subjected to the much more\r\ntrying and doubtful ordeal of the House.  What would be its fate there?\r\nThis was a question which gave to Mr. Lincoln, and the other friends of\r\nLiberty and Union, great concern.\r\n\r\nIt is true that various votes had recently been taken in that body, upon\r\npropositions which had an indirect bearing upon the subject of\r\nEmancipation, as, for instance, that of the 1st of February, 1864, when,\r\nby a vote of 80 yeas to 46 nays, it had adopted a Resolution declaring\r\n\"That a more vigorous policy to enlist, at an early day, and in larger\r\nnumbers, in our Army, persons of African descent, would meet the\r\napprobation of the House;\" and that vote, although indirect, being so\r\nvery nearly a two-thirds vote, was most encouraging.  But, on the other\r\nhand, a subsequent Resolution, squarely testing the sense of the House\r\nupon the subject, had been carried by much less than a two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\nThis latter Resolution, offered by Mr. Arnold, after conference with Mr.\r\nLincoln, with the very purpose of making a test, was in these direct\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Constitution shall be so amended as to Abolish\r\nSlavery in the United States wherever it now exists, and to prohibit its\r\nexistence in every part thereof forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe vote, adopting it, was but 78 yeas to 62 nays.  * This vote,\r\ntherefore, upon the Arnold Resolution, being nowhere near the two-thirds\r\naffirmative vote necessary to secure the passage through the House of\r\nthe Senate Joint Resolution on this subject amendatory of the\r\nConstitution, was most discouraging.\r\n\r\nIt was definite enough, however, to show the necessity of a change from\r\nthe negative to the affirmative side of at least fifteen votes.  While\r\ntherefore the outlook was discouraging it was far from hopeless.  The\r\ndebate in the Senate had already had its effect upon the public mind.\r\nThat, and the utterances of Mr. Lincoln--and further discussion in the\r\nHouse, it was thought, might produce such a pressure from the loyal\r\nconstituencies both in the Free and Border Slave-States as to compel\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBut from the very beginning of the year 1864, as if instinctively aware\r\nthat their Rebel friends were approaching the crisis of their fate, and\r\nneeded now all the help that their allies of the North could give them,\r\nthe Anti-War Democrats, in Congress, and out, had been stirring\r\nthemselves with unusual activity.\r\n\r\nIn both Houses of Congress, upon all possible occasions, they\r\nhad been striving, as they still strove, with the venom of their\r\nwidely-circulated speeches, to poison the loyal Northern and\r\nBorder-State mind, in the hope that the renomination of Mr. Lincoln\r\nmight be defeated, the chance for Democratic success at the coming\r\nPresidential election be thereby increased, and, if nothing else came\r\nof it, the Union Cause be weakened and the Rebel Cause correspondingly\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, evidently under secret instructions from their\r\nfriends, the Conspirators in arms, they endeavored to create\r\nheart-burnings and jealousies and ill-feeling between the Eastern\r\n(especially the New England) States and the Western States, and\r\nunceasingly attacked the Protective-Tariff, Internal Revenue, the\r\nGreenback, the Draft, and every other measure or thing upon which the\r\nlife of the Union depended.\r\n\r\nMost of these Northern-Democratic agitators, \"Stealing the livery of\r\nHeaven to serve the Devil in,\" endeavored to conceal their treacherous\r\ndesigns under a veneer of gushing lip-loyalty, but that disguise was\r\n\"too thin\" to deceive either their contemporaries or those who come\r\nafter them.  Some of their language too, as well as their blustering\r\nmanner, strangely brought back to recollection the old days of Slavery\r\nwhen the plantation-whip was cracked in the House, and the air was blue\r\nwith execration of New England.\r\n\r\nSaid Voorhees, of Indiana, (January 11, 1864) when the House was\r\nconsidering a Bill \"to increase the Internal Revenue and for other\r\npurposes:\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to know whether the West has any friends upon the floor of this\r\nHouse?  We pay every dollar that is to be levied by this Tax Bill.  * *\r\n*  The Manufacturing Interest pays not a dollar into the public Treasury\r\nthat stays there.  And yet airs of patriotism are put on here by men\r\nrepresenting that interest.  I visited New England last Summer, * * *\r\nwhen I heard the swelling hum of her Manufactories, and saw those who\r\nonly a short time ago worked but a few hands, now working their\r\nthousands, and rolling up their countless wealth, I felt that it was an\r\nunhealthy prosperity.  To my mind it presented a wealth wrung from the\r\nlabor, the sinews, the bone and muscle of the men who till the soil,\r\ntaxed to an illegitimate extent to foster and support that great System\r\nof local wealth.  * * *  I do not intend to stand idly by and see one\r\nportion of the Country robbed and oppressed for the benefit of another.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the same day, replying to Mr. Morrill of Vermont, he exclaimed: \"Let\r\nhim show me that the plethoric, bloated Manufacturers of New England are\r\npaying anything to support the Government, and I will recognize it.\"\r\n\r\nWashburne, of Illinois got back at this part of Mr. Voorhees's speech\r\nrather neatly, by defending the North-west as being \"not only willing to\r\nstand taxation\" which had been \"already imposed, but * * * any\r\nadditional taxation which,\" said he, \"may be necessary to crush out this\r\nRebellion, and to hang the Rebels in the South, and the Rebel\r\nsympathizers in the North.\"  And, he pointedly added: \"Complaint has\r\nbeen made against New England.  I know that kind of talk.  I have heard\r\ntoo often that kind of slang about New England.  I heard it here for ten\r\nyears, when your Barksdales, and your Keitts's, and your other Traitors,\r\nnow in arms against the Government, filled these Halls with their\r\npestilential assaults not only upon New England, but on the Free North\r\ngenerally.\"\r\n\r\nKelley of Pennsylvania, however, more fitly characterized the speech of\r\nVoorhees, when he termed it \"a pretty, indeed a somewhat striking,\r\nparaphrase of the argument of Mr. Lamar, the Rebel Agent,--[in 1886,\r\nSecretary of the Interior]--to his confreres in Treason, as we find it\r\nin the recently published correspondence: 'Drive gold coin out of the\r\nCountry, and induce undue Importation of Foreign products so as to\r\nstrike down the Financial System.  You can have no further hope for\r\nForeign recognition.  It is evident the weight of arms is against us;\r\nand it is clear that we can only succeed by striking down the Financial\r\nSystem of the Country.' It was an admirable paraphrase of the\r\nInstructions of Mr. Lamar to the Rebel Agents in the North.\"\r\n\r\nThe impression was at this time abroad, and there were not wanting\r\nelements of proof, that certain members of Congress were trusted\r\nLieutenants of the Arch-copperhead and Outlaw, Vallandigham.  Certain it\r\nis, that many of these leaders, six months before, attended and\r\naddressed the great gathering from various parts of the Country, of\r\nnearly one hundred thousand Vallandigham-Anti-War Peace-Democrats, at\r\nSpringfield, Illinois--the very home of Abraham Lincoln--which adopted,\r\nduring a lull, when they were not yelling themselves hoarse for\r\nVallandigham, a resolution declaring against \"the further offensive\r\nprosecution of the War\" as being subversive of the Constitution and\r\nGovernment, and proposing a National Peace Convention, and, as a\r\nconsequence, Peace, \"the Union as it was,\" and, substantially such\r\nConstitutional guarantees as the Rebels might choose to demand!  And\r\nthis too, at a time (June 13, 1863), when Grant, after many recent\r\nglorious victories, had been laying siege to Vicksburg, and its Rebel\r\nArmy of 37,000 men, for nearly a month, with every reason to hope for\r\nits speedy fall.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that under such circumstances, the news of such a gathering of\r\nthe Northern Democratic sympathizers with Treason, and of their adoption\r\nof such treasonable Resolutions, should encourage the Rebels in the same\r\ndegree that Union men were disheartened!  No wonder that Lee, elated by\r\nthis and other evidences of Northern sympathy with Rebellion, at once\r\ndetermined to commence a second grand invasion of the North, and on the\r\nvery next day (June 14th,) moved Northward with all his Rebel hosts to\r\nbe welcomed, he fondly hoped, by his Northern friends of Maryland and\r\nelsewhere!  As we have seen, it took the bloody Battle of Gettysburg to\r\nundeceive him as to the character of that welcome.\r\n\r\nFurther than this, Mr. Cox had stumped Ohio, in the succeeding election,\r\nin a desperate effort to make the banished Traitor, Vallandigham--the\r\nChief Northern commander of the \"Knights of the Golden Circle\"\r\n(otherwise known as the \"Order of the Sons of Liberty,\" and \"O. A. K.\"\r\nor \"Order of American Knights\")--Governor of that great State.\r\n\r\n     [The Rebel General Sterling Price being the chief Southern\r\n     commander of this many-named treasonable organization, which in the\r\n     North alone numbered over 500,000 men.\r\n\r\n     August, 1864.--See Report of Judge Advocate Holt on certain \"Secret\r\n     Associations,\" in Appendix,]\r\n\r\nAnd it only lacked a few months of the time when quantities of copies of\r\nthe treasonable Ritual of the \"Order of American Knights\"--as well as\r\ncorrespondence touching the purchase of thousands of Garibaldi rifles\r\nfor transportation to the West--were found in the offices of leading\r\nDemocrats then in Congress.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, it is said, and repeated, that there were not wanting\r\nelements of proof, outside of Congressional utterances and actions, that\r\nleading Democrats in Congress were trusted Lieutenants of the Supreme\r\nCommander of over half a million of Northern Rebel-sympathizers bound\r\ntogether, and to secrecy, by oaths, which were declared to be paramount\r\nto all other oaths, the violation of which subjected the offender to a\r\nshameful death somewhat like that, of being \"hung, drawn, and\r\nquartered,\" which was inflicted in the middle ages for the crime of\r\nTreason to the Crown--it will be seen that the statement is supported by\r\ncircumstantial, if not by positive and direct, evidence.\r\n\r\nWhether the Coxes, the Garret Davises, the Saulsburys, the Fernando\r\nWoods, the Alexander Longs, the Allens, the Holmans, and many other\r\nprominent Congressmen of that sort,--were merely in close communion with\r\nthese banded \"Knights,\" or were actual members of their secret\r\norganizations, may be an open question.  But it is very certain that if\r\nthey all were not oath-bound members, they generally pursued the precise\r\nmethods of those who were; and that, as a rule, while they often loudly\r\nproclaimed loyalty and love for the Union, they were always ready to act\r\nas if their loyalty and love were for the so-called Confederacy.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was one of these other \"loyal\" Democrats, who even preceded\r\nVoorhees, in raising the Sectional cry of: The West, against New\r\nEngland.  It was on this same Internal Revenue Bill, that Holman of\r\nIndiana had, the day before Voorhees's attack, said:\r\n\r\n\"If the Manufacture of the Northwest is to be taxed so heavily, a\r\ncorresponding rate of increase must be imposed on the Manufactures of\r\nNew England and Pennsylvania, or, will gentlemen tax us without limit\r\nfor the benefit of their own Section?  * * * I protest against what I\r\nbelieve is intended to be a discrimination against one Section of the\r\nCountry, by increasing the tax three-fold, without a corresponding\r\nincrease upon the burdens of other Sections.\"\r\n\r\nBut these dreadfully \"loyal\" Democrats--who did the bidding of\r\ntraitorous masters in their Treason to the Union, and thus, while\r\nposturing as \"Patriots,\" \"fired upon the rear\" of our hard-pressed\r\nArmies--were super-sensitive on this point.  And, when they could get\r\nhold of a quiet sort of a man, inclined to peaceful methods of\r\ndiscussion, how they would, terrier-like, pounce upon him, and extract\r\nfrom him, if they could, some sort of negative satisfaction!\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, on the 22nd of January, when one of these quiet men\r\n--Morris of New York--was in the midst of an inoffensive speech, Mr. Cox\r\n\"bristled up,\" and blusteringly asked whether he meant to say that he\r\n(Cox) had \"ever been the apologist or the defender of a Traitor?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Morris not having said so, mildly replied that he did \"not so\r\ncharge\"--all of which little bit of by-play hugely pleased the touchy\r\nMr. Cox, and his clansmen.\r\n\r\nBut on the day following, their smiles vanished under the words of\r\nSpalding or Ohio, who, after referring to the crocodile-tears shed by\r\nDemocratic Congressmen over the Confiscation Resolution--on the pretense\r\nthat it would hunt down \"innocent women and children\" of the Rebels,\r\nwhen they had never a word of sympathy for the widows and children of\r\nthe two hundred thousand dead soldiers of the Union-continued:\r\n\r\n\"They can see our poor soldiers return, minus an arm, minus a leg, as\r\nthey pass through these lobbies, but their only care is to protect the\r\nproperty of Rebels.  And we are asked by one of my colleagues, (Mr. Cox)\r\ndoes the gentleman from New York intend to call us Traitors?  My friend,\r\nMr. Morris, modestly answered no!  If he had asked that question of me,\r\nhe knows what my answer would have been!  I have seen Rebel officers at\r\nJohnson's Island, and I have taken them by the hand because they have\r\nfought us fairly in the field and did not seek to break down the\r\nGovernment while living under its protection.  Yes, Sir, that gentleman\r\nknows that I would have said to him that I have more respect for an open\r\nand avowed Traitor in the field, than for a sympathizer in this Hall.\r\nFour months have scarcely gone by since that gentleman and his political\r\nfriends were advocating the election of a man for the Gubernatorial\r\noffice in my State, who was an open and avowed advocate of Secession--AN\r\nOUTLAW AT THAT!\"\r\n\r\nAnd old Thaddeus Stevens--the clear-sighted and courageous \"Old\r\nCommoner\"--followed up Spalding, and struck very close to the root and\r\nanimus of the Democratic opposition, when he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"All this struggle by calm and dignified and moderate 'Patriots;' all\r\nthis clamor against 'Radicals;' all this cry of 'the Union as it Was,\r\nand the Constitution as it Is;' is but a persistent effort to\r\nreestablish Slavery, and to rivet anew and forever the chains of Bondage\r\non the limbs of Immortal beings.  May the God of Justice thwart their\r\ndesigns and paralyze their wicked efforts!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n                        \"THE FIRE IN THE REAR.\"\r\n\r\nThe treacherous purposes of professedly-loyal Copperheads being seen\r\nthrough, and promptly and emphatically denounced to the Country by Union\r\nstatesmen, the Copperheads aforesaid concluded that the profuse\r\ncirculation of their own Treason-breeding speeches--through the medium\r\nof the treasonable organizations before referred to, permeating the\r\nNorthern States,--would more than counteract all that Union men could\r\nsay or do.  Besides, the fiat had gone forth, from their Rebel masters\r\nat Richmond, to Agitate the North.\r\n\r\nHence, day after day, Democrat after Democrat, in the one House or the\r\nother, continued to air his disloyal opinions, and to utter more or less\r\nvirulent denunciations of the Government which guarded and protected\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThus, Brooks, of New York, on the 25th of January (1864), sneeringly\r\nexclaimed: \"Why, what absurdity it is to talk at this Capitol of\r\nprosecuting the War by the liberation of Slaves, when from the dome of\r\nthis building there can be heard at this hour the booming of cannon in\r\nthe distance!\"\r\n\r\nThus, also, on the day following, Fernando Wood--the same man who,\r\nwhile Mayor of New York at the outbreak of the Rebellion, had, under\r\nRebel-guidance, proposed the Secession from the Union, and the\r\nIndependence, of that great Metropolis,--declared to the House that: \"No\r\nGovernment has pursued a foe with such unrelenting, vindictive malignity\r\nas we are now pursuing those who came into the Union with us, whose\r\nblood has been freely shed on every battle-field of the Country until\r\nnow, with our own; who fought by our side in the American Revolution,\r\nand in the War of 1812 with Great Britain; who bore our banners bravest\r\nand highest in our victorious march from Vera Cruz to the City of\r\nMexico, and who but yesterday sat in these Halls contributing toward the\r\nmaintenance of our glorious institutions.\"\r\n\r\nThen he went on, in the spirit of prophecy, to declare that: \"No purely\r\nagricultural people, fighting for the protection of their own Domestic\r\nInstitutions upon their own soil, have ever yet been conquered.  I say\r\nfurther, that no revolted people have ever been subdued after they have\r\nbeen able to maintain an Independent government for three years.\"  And\r\nthen, warming up to an imperative mood, he made this explicit\r\nannouncement: \"We are at War.  * * *  Whether it be a Civil War,\r\nRebellion, Revolution, or Foreign War, it matters little.  IT MUST\r\nCEASE; and I want this Administration to tell the American People WHEN\r\nit will cease!\"  Again, only two days afterward, he took occasion to\r\ncharacterize a Bill, amendatory of the enrollment Act, as \"this\r\ninfamous, Unconstitutional conscription Act!\"\r\n\r\nC. A. White, of Ohio, was another of the malcontents who undertook, with\r\nothers of the same Copperhead faith, to \"maintain, that,\" as he\r\nexpressed it, \"the War in which we are at present engaged is wrong in\r\nitself; that the policy adopted by the Party in power for its\r\nprosecution is wrong; that the Union cannot be restored, or, if\r\nrestored, maintained, by the exercise of the coercive power of the\r\nGovernment, by War; that the War is opposed to the restoration of the\r\nUnion, destructive of the rights of the States and the liberties of the\r\nPeople.  It ought, therefore, to be brought to a speedy and immediate\r\nclose.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about this time also that, emboldened by immunity from punishment\r\nfor these utterances in the interest of armed Rebels, Edgerton of\r\nIndiana, was put forward to offer resolutions \"for Peace, upon the basis\r\nof a restoration of the Federal Union under the Constitution as it is,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThereafter, in both Senate and House, such speeches by\r\nRebel-sympathizers, the aiders and abettors of Treason, grew more\r\nfrequent and more virulent than ever.  As was well said to the House,\r\nby one of the Union members from Ohio (Mr. Eckley):\r\n\r\n\"A stranger, if he listened to the debates here, would think himself in\r\nthe Confederate Congress.  I do not believe that if these Halls were\r\noccupied to-day by Davis, Toombs, Wigfall, Rhett, and Pryor, they could\r\nadd anything to the violence of assault, the falsity of accusation, or\r\nthe malignity of attack, with which the Government has been assailed,\r\nand the able, patriotic, and devoted men who are charged with its\r\nAdministration have been maligned, in both ends of the Capitol.  The\r\nclosing scenes of the Thirty-Sixth Congress, the treasonable\r\ndeclarations there made, contain nothing that we cannot hear, in the\r\nfreedom of debate, without going to Richmond or to the camps of Treason,\r\nwhere most of the actors in those scenes are now in arms against us.\"\r\n\r\nWith such a condition of things in Congress, it is not surprising that\r\nthe Richmond Enquirer announced that the North was \"distracted,\r\nexhausted, and impoverished,\" and would, \"through the agency of a strong\r\nconservative element in the Free States,\" soon treat with the Rebels \"on\r\nacceptable terms.\"\r\n\r\nThings indeed had reached such a pass, in the House of Representatives\r\nespecially, that it was felt they could not much longer go on in this\r\nmanner; that an example must be made of some one or other of these\r\nCopperheads.  But the very knowledge of the existence of such a feeling\r\nof just and patriotic irritation against the continued free utterance of\r\nsuch sentiments in the Halls of Congress, seemed only to make some of\r\nthem still more defiant.  And, when the 8th of April dawned, it was\r\nknown among all the Democrats in Congress, that Alexander Long proposed\r\nthat day to make a speech which would \"go a bow-shot beyond them all\" in\r\nuttered Treason.  He would speak right out, what the other Conspirators\r\nthought and meant, but dared not utter, before the World.\r\n\r\nA crowded floor, and packed galleries, were on hand to listen to the\r\nwritten, deliberate Treason, as it fell from his lips in the House.  His\r\nspeech began with an arraignment of the Government for treachery,\r\nincompetence, failure, tyranny, and all sorts of barbarous actions and\r\nharsh intentions, toward the Rebels--which led him to the indignant\r\nexclamation:\r\n\r\n\"Will they throw down their arms and submit to the terms?  Who shall\r\nbelieve that the free, proud American blood, which courses with as quick\r\npulsation through their veins as our own, will not be spilled to the\r\nlast drop in resistance?\"\r\n\r\nWarming up, he proceeded to say: \"Can the Union be restored by War?  I\r\nanswer most unhesitatingly and deliberately, No, never; 'War is final,\r\neternal separation.'\"\r\n\r\nHe claimed that the War was \"wrong;\" that it was waged \"in violation of\r\nthe Constitution,\" and would \"if continued, result speedily in the\r\ndestruction of the Government and the loss of Civil Liberty, and ought\r\ntherefore, to immediately cease.\"\r\n\r\nHe held also \"that the Confederate States are out of the Union,\r\noccupying the position of an Independent Power de facto; have been\r\nacknowledged as a belligerent both by Foreign Nations and our own\r\nGovernment; maintained their Declaration of Independence, for three\r\nyears, by force of arms; and the War has cut asunder all the obligations\r\nthat bound them under the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Much better,\" said he, \"would it have been for us in the beginning,\r\nmuch better would it be for us now, to consent to a division of our\r\nmagnificent Empire, and cultivate amicable relations with our estranged\r\nbrethren, than to seek to hold them to us by the power of the sword.  *\r\n* * I am reluctantly and despondingly forced to the conclusion that the\r\nUnion is lost, never to be restored.  * * * I see neither North nor\r\nSouth, any sentiment on which it is possible to build a Union.  * * * in\r\nattempting to preserve our Jurisdiction over the Southern States we have\r\nlost our Constitutional Form of Government over the Northern.  * * * The\r\nvery idea upon which this War is founded, coercion of States, leads to\r\ndespotism.  * * * I now believe that there are but two alternatives, and\r\nthey are either an acknowledgment of the Independence of the South as an\r\nindependent Nation, or their complete subjugation and extermination as a\r\nPeople; and of these alternatives I prefer the former.\"\r\n\r\nAs Long took his seat, amid the congratulations of his Democratic\r\nfriends, Garfield arose, and, to compliments upon the former's peculiar\r\ncandor and honesty, added denunciation for his Treason.  After drawing\r\nan effective parallel between Lord Fairfax and Robert E. Lee, both of\r\nwhom had cast their lots unwillingly with the enemies of this Land, when\r\nthe Wars of the Revolution and of the Rebellion respectively opened,\r\nGarfield proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"But now, when hundreds of thousands of brave souls have gone up to God\r\nunder the shadow of the Flag, and when thousands more, maimed and\r\nshattered in the Contest, are sadly awaiting the deliverance of death;\r\nnow, when three years of terrific warfare have raged over us, when our\r\nArmies have pushed the Rebellion back over mountains and rivers and\r\ncrowded it back into narrow limits, until a wall of fire girds it; now,\r\nwhen the uplifted hand of a majestic People is about to let fall the\r\nlightning of its conquering power upon the Rebellion; now, in the quiet\r\nof this Hall, hatched in the lowest depths of a similar dark Treason,\r\nthere rises a Benedict Arnold and proposes to surrender us all up, body\r\nand spirit, the Nation and the Flag, its genius and its honor, now and\r\nforever, to the accursed Traitors to our Country.  And that proposition\r\ncomes--God forgive and pity my beloved State!--it comes from a citizen\r\nof the honored and loyal Commonwealth of Ohio!  I implore you, brethren\r\nin this House, not to believe that many such births ever gave pangs to\r\nmy mother-State such as she suffered when that Traitor was born!\"\r\n\r\nAs he uttered these sturdy words, the House and galleries were agitated\r\nwith that peculiar rustling movement and low murmuring sound known as a\r\n\"sensation,\" while the Republican side with difficulty restrained the\r\napplause they felt like giving, until he sadly proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"I beg you not to believe that on the soil of that State another such\r\ngrowth has ever deformed the face of Nature and darkened the light of\r\nGod's day.\"\r\n\r\nThe hush that followed was broken by the suggestive whisper:\r\n\"Vallandigham!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, ah,\" continued the Speaker--as his voice grew sadder still--\"I am\r\nreminded that there are other such.  My zeal and love for Ohio have\r\ncarried me too far.  I retract.  I remember that only a few days since,\r\na political Convention met at the Capital of my State, and almost\r\ndecided, to select from just such material, a representative for the\r\nDemocratic Party in the coming contest; and today, what claims to be a\r\nmajority of the Democracy of that State say that they have been cheated\r\nor they would have made that choice!\"\r\n\r\n     [This refers to Horatio Seymour, the Democratic Governor of New\r\n     York.]\r\n\r\nAfter referring to the \"insidious work\" of the \"Knights of the Golden\r\nCircle\" in seeking \"to corrupt the Army and destroy its efficiency;\" the\r\n\"riots and murders which,\" said he, \"their agents are committing\r\nthroughout the Loyal North, under the lead and guidance of the Party\r\nwhose Representatives sit yonder across the aisle;\" he continued: \"and\r\nnow, just as the time is coming on when we are to select a President for\r\nthe next four years, one rises among them and fires the Beacon, throws\r\nup the blue-light--which will be seen, and rejoiced over, at the Rebel\r\nCapital in Richmond--as the signal that the Traitors in our camp are\r\norganized and ready for their hellish work!  I believe the utterance of\r\nto-day is the uplifted banner of revolt.  I ask you to mark the signal\r\nthat blazes here, and see if there will not soon appear the answering\r\nsignals of Traitors all over the Land.  * * * If these men do mean to\r\nlight the torch of War in all our homes; if they have resolved to begin\r\nthe fearful work which will redden our streets, and this Capitol, with\r\nblood, the American People should know it at once, and prepare to meet\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of Mr. Garfield's patriotic and eloquent remarks, Mr. Long\r\nagain got the floor, declared that what he had said, he believed to be\r\nright, and he would \"stand by it,\" though he had to \"stand solitary and\r\nalone,\" and \"even if it were necessary to brave bayonets, and prisons,\r\nand all the tyranny which may be imposed by the whole power and force of\r\nthe Administration.\"\r\n\r\nSaid he: \"I have deliberately uttered my sentiments in that speech, and\r\nI will not retract one syllable of it.\"  And, to \"rub it in\" a little\r\nstronger, he exclaimed, as he took his seat, just before adjournment:\r\n\"Give me Liberty, even if confined to an Island of Greece, or a Canton\r\nof Switzerland, rather than an Empire and a Despotism as we have here\r\nto-day!\"\r\n\r\nThis treasonable speech naturally created much excitement throughout the\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nOn the following day (Saturday, April 9, 1864), immediately after\r\nprayer, the reading of the Journal being dispensed with, the Speaker of\r\nthe House (Colfax) came down from the Speaker's Chair, and, from the\r\nfloor, offered a Preamble and Resolution, which ended thus:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Alexander Long, a Representative from the second\r\ndistrict of Ohio, having, on the 8th day of April, 1864, declared\r\nhimself in favor of recognizing the Independence and Nationality of the\r\nso-called Confederacy now in arms against the Union, and thereby 'given\r\naid, Countenance and encouragement to persons engaged in armed hostility\r\nto the United States,' is hereby expelled.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate which ensued consumed nearly a week, and every member of\r\nprominence, on both the Republican and Democratic sides, took part in\r\nit--the Democrats almost invariably being careful to protest their own\r\nloyalty, and yet attempting to justify the braver and more candid\r\nutterances of the accused member.\r\n\r\nMr. Cox led off, April 9th, in the defense, by counterattack.  He quoted\r\nremarks made to the House (March 18, 1864) by Mr. Julian, of Indiana, to\r\nthe effect that \"Our Country, united and Free, must be saved, at\r\nwhatever hazard or cost; and nothing, not even the Constitution, must be\r\nallowed to hold back the uplifted arm of the Government in blasting the\r\npower of the Rebels forever;\"--and upon this, adopting the language of\r\nanother--[Judge Thomas, of Massachusetts.]--Mr. Cox declared that \"to\r\nmake this a War, with the sword in one hand to defend the Constitution,\r\nand a hammer in the other to break it to pieces, is no less treasonable\r\nthan Secession itself; and that, outside the pale of the Constitution,\r\nthe whole struggle is revolutionary.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought, for such words as he had just quoted, Julian ought to have\r\nbeen expelled, if those of Long justified expulsion!\r\n\r\nFinally, being pressed by Julian to define his own position, as between\r\nthe Life of the Nation, and the Infraction of the United States\r\nConstitution, Mr. Cox said: \"I will say this, that UNDER NO\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES CONCEIVABLE BY THE HUMAN MIND WOULD I EVER VIOLATE THAT\r\nCONSTITUTION FOR ANY PURPOSE!\"\r\n\r\nThis sentiment was loudly applauded, and received with cries of \"THAT IS\r\nIT!\"  \"THAT'S IT!\" by the Democratic side of the House, apparently in\r\nutter contempt for the express and emphatic declaration of Jefferson\r\nthat: \"A strict observance of the written laws is doubtless one of the\r\nhighest duties of a good citizen, but it is not the highest.  The laws\r\nof Necessity, of Self-preservation, of SAVING OUR COUNTRY WHEN IN\r\nDANGER, are of higher obligation.  To LOSE OUR COUNTRY by a scrupulous\r\nadherence to written law WOULD BE TO LOSE THE LAW ITSELF, with Life,\r\nLiberty, Property, and all those who are enjoying them with us; thus\r\nabsolutely SACRIFICING THE END TO THE MEANS.\"\r\n\r\n     [In a letter to J.  B.  Colvin, Sept.  20, 1810, quoted at the time\r\n     for their information, and which may be found at page 542 of vol.\r\n     v., of Jefferson's Works.]\r\n\r\nIndeed these extreme sticklers for the letter of the Constitution, who\r\nwould have sacrificed Country, kindred, friends, honesty, truth, and all\r\nambitions on Earth and hopes for Heaven, rather than violate it--for\r\nthat is what Mr. Cox's announcement and the Democratic endorsement of it\r\nmeant, if they meant anything--were of the same stripe as those\r\nquerulous Ancients, for the benefit of whom the Apostle wrote: \"For THE\r\nLETTER KILLETH, but the Spirit giveth life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, inspired apparently by the reckless utterances\r\nof Long, if not by the more cautious diatribe of Cox, Harris of\r\nMaryland, determining if possible to outdo them all, not only declared\r\nthat he was willing to go with his friend Long wherever the House chose\r\nto send him, but added: \"I am a peace man, a radical peace man; and I am\r\nfor Peace by the recognition of the South, for the recognition of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy; and I am for acquiescence in the doctrine of\r\nSecession.\"  And, said he, in the midst of the laughter which followed\r\nthe sensation his treasonable words occasioned, \"Laugh as you may, you\r\nhave got to come to it!\"  And then, with that singular obfuscation of\r\nideas engendered, in the heads of their followers, by the astute\r\nRebel-sympathizing leaders, he went on:\r\n\r\n\"I am for Peace, and I am for Union too.  I am as good a Union man as\r\nany of you.  [Laughter.] I am a better Union man than any of you!\r\n[Great Laughter.] * * * I look upon War as Disunion.\"\r\n\r\nAfter declaring that, if the principle of the expulsion Resolution was\r\nto be carried out, his \"friend,\" Mr. Long, \"would be a martyr in a\r\nglorious cause\"--he proceeded to announce his own candidacy for\r\nexpulsion, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Speaker, in the early part of this Secession movement, there was a\r\nResolution offered, pledging men and money to carry on the War.  My\r\nprinciples were then, and are now, against the War.  I stood, solitary\r\nand alone, in voting against that Resolution, and whenever a similar\r\nproposition is brought here it will meet with my opposition.  Not one\r\ndollar, nor one man, I swear, by the Eternal, will I vote for this\r\ninfernal, this stupendous folly, more stupendous than ever disgraced any\r\ncivilized People on the face of God's Earth.  If that be Treason, make\r\nthe most of it!\r\n\r\n\"The South asked you to let them go in peace.  But no, you said you\r\nwould bring them into subjugation.  That is not done yet, and God\r\nAlmighty grant that it never may be.  I hope that you will never\r\nsubjugate the South.  If she is to be ever again in the Union, I hope it\r\nwill be with her own consent; and I hope that that consent will be\r\nobtained by some other mode than by the sword.  'If this be Treason,\r\nmake the most of it!'\"\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary scene at once occurred--Mr. Tracy desiring \"to know\r\nwhether, in these Halls, the gentleman from Maryland invoked Almighty\r\nGod that the American Arms should not prevail?\"  \"Whether such language\r\nis not Treason?\" and \"whether it is in order to talk Treason in this\r\nHall?\"--his patriotic queries being almost drowned in the incessant\r\ncries of \"Order!\"  \"Order!\"  and great disorder, and confusion, on the\r\nDemocratic side of the House.\r\n\r\nFinally the treasonable language was taken down by the Clerk, and, while\r\na Resolution for the expulsion of Mr. Harris was being written out, Mr.\r\nFernando Wood--coming, as he said, from a bed of \"severe sickness,\"\r\nquoted the language used by Mr. Long, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"I now believe there are but two alternatives, and they are either the\r\nacknowledgment of the Independence of the South as an independent\r\nNation, or their complete subjugation and extermination as a People; and\r\nof these alternatives I prefer the former\"--and declared that \"if he is\r\nto be expelled for the utterance of that sentiment, you may include me\r\nin it, because I concur fully in that sentiment.\"\r\n\r\n     [He afterwards (April 11,) said he did not agree with Mr. Long's\r\n     opinions.]\r\n\r\nEvery effort was unavailingly made by the Democrats, under the lead of\r\nMessrs. Cox--[In 1886 American Minister at Constantinople.]--and\r\nPendleton,--[In 1886 American Minister at Berlin.]--to prevent action\r\nupon the new Resolution of expulsion, which was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, Hon. Benjamin G. Harris, a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States from the State of Maryland, has on\r\nthis day used the following language, to wit: 'The South asked you to\r\nlet them go in peace.  But no; you said you would bring them into\r\nsubjection.  That is not done yet, and God Almighty grant that it never\r\nmay be.  I hope that you will never subjugate the South.'  And whereas,\r\nsuch language is treasonable, and is a gross disrespect of this House:\r\nTherefore, 'Be it Resolved, That the said Benjamin G. Harris be expelled\r\nfrom this House.'\"\r\n\r\nUpon reaching a vote, however, the Resolution was lost, there being only\r\n81 yeas, to 58 (Democratic) nays--two-thirds not having voted\r\naffirmatively.  Subsequently, despite Democratic efforts to obstruct, a\r\nResolution, declaring Harris to be \"an unworthy Member\" of the House,\r\nand \"severely\" censuring him, was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe debate upon the Long-expulsion Resolution now proceeded, and its\r\nmover, in view of the hopelessness of securing a two-thirds affirmative\r\nvote, having accepted an amendment comprising other two Resolutions and\r\na Preamble, the question upon adopting these was submitted on the 14th\r\nof April.  They were in the words following:\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, ALEXANDER LONG, a Representative from the second district of\r\nOhio, by his open declarations in the National Capitol, and publications\r\nin the City of New York, has shown himself to be in favor of a\r\nrecognition of the so-called Confederacy now trying to establish itself\r\nupon the ruins of our Country, thereby giving aid and comfort to the\r\nEnemy in that destructive purpose--aid to avowed Traitors, in creating\r\nan illegal Government within our borders, comfort to them by assurances\r\nof their success and affirmations of the justice of their Cause; and\r\nwhereas, such conduct is at the same time evidence of disloyalty, and\r\ninconsistent with his oath of office, and his duty as a Member of this\r\nBody: Therefore,\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the said Alexander Long, a Representative from the\r\nsecond district of Ohio, be, and he is hereby declared to be an unworthy\r\nMember of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Speaker shall read these Resolutions to the said\r\nAlexander Long during the session of the House.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of these Resolutions was adopted, by 80 yeas to 69 nays; the\r\nsecond was tabled, by 71 yeas to 69 nays; and the Preamble was agreed\r\nto, by 78 yeas to 63 nays.\r\n\r\nAnd, among the 63 Democrats, who were not only unwilling to declare\r\nAlexander Long \"an unworthy Member,\" or to have the Speaker read such a\r\ndeclaration to him in a session of the House, but also refused by their\r\nvotes even to intimate that his conduct evidenced disloyalty, or gave\r\naid and comfort to the Enemy, were the names of such democrats as Cox,\r\nEldridge, Holman, Kernan, Morrisson, Pendleton, Samuel J. Randall,\r\nVoorhees, and Fernando Wood.\r\n\r\nHence Mr. Long not only escaped expulsion for his treasonable\r\nutterances, but did not even receive the \"severe censure\" which, in\r\naddition to being declared (like himself) \"an unworthy Member,\" had been\r\nvoted to Mr. Harris for recklessly rushing into the breach to help him!\r\n\r\n     [The Northern Democracy comprised two well-recognized classes: The\r\n     Anti-War (or Peace) Democrats, commonly called \"Copperheads,\" who\r\n     sympathized with the Rebellion, and opposed the War for the Union;\r\n     and the War (or Union) Democrats, who favored a vigorous\r\n     prosecution of the War for the preservation of the Union.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n             \"THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT\" DEFEATED IN THE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the House of Representatives, upon the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution--interrupted by the treasonable episode\r\nreferred to in the last Chapter--was subsequently resumed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Fort Pillow had been stormed, and its garrison of\r\nWhites and Blacks, massacred.\r\n\r\nAnd now commenced the beginning of the end-so far as the Military aspect\r\nof the Rebellion was concerned.  Early in May, Sherman's Atlanta\r\nCampaign commenced, and, simultaneously, General Grant began his\r\nmovement toward Richmond.  In quick succession came the news of the\r\nbloody battles of the Wilderness, and those around Spottsylvania, Va.;\r\nat Buzzard Roost Gap, Snake Creek Gap, and Dalton, Ga.; Drury's Bluff,\r\nVa.; Resaca, Ga.; the battles of the North Anna, Va.; those around\r\nDallas, and New Hope church, Ga; the crossing of Grant's forces to the\r\nSouth side of the James and the assault on Petersburg.  While the Union\r\nArmies were thus valiantly attacking and beating those of the Rebels, on\r\nmany a sanguinary field the loyal men of the North, both in and out of\r\nCongress, pressed for favorable action upon the Thirteenth Amendment.\r\n\"Friends of the wounded in Fredericksburg from the Battle of the\r\nWilderness\"--exclaimed Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune, of May\r\n31st,--\"friends and relatives of the soldiers of Grant's Army beyond the\r\nWilderness, let us all join hands and swear upon our Country's altar\r\nthat we will never cease this War until African Slavery in the United\r\nStates is dead forever, and forever buried!\"\r\n\r\nPeace Democrats, however, were deaf to all such entreaties.  On the very\r\nsame day, Mr. Holman, in the House, objected even to the second reading\r\nof the Joint Resolution Amendatory of the Constitution, and there were\r\nso many \"Peace Democrats\" to back him, that the vote was: 55 yeas to 76\r\nnays, on the question \"shall the Joint Resolution be rejected!\"\r\n\r\nThe old cry, that had been repeated by Hendricks and others, in the\r\nSenate and House, time and again, was still used--threadbare though it\r\nwas--\"this is not the right time for it!\"  On this very day, for\r\ninstance, Mr. Herrick said: \"I ask if this is the proper time for our\r\nPeople to consider so grave a measure as the Amendment of the\r\nConstitution in so vital a point?  * * * this is no fitting time for\r\nsuch work.\"\r\n\r\nVery different was the attitude of Kellogg, of New York, and well did he\r\nshow up the depths to which the Democracy--the Peace Democracy--had now\r\nfallen.  \"We are told,\" said he, \"of a War Democracy, and such there\r\nare--their name is legion--good men and true; they are found in the\r\nUnion ranks bearing arms in support of the Government and the\r\nAdministration that wields it.  At the ballot-box, whether at home or in\r\nthe camp, they are Union men, and vote as they fight, and hold little in\r\ncommon with the political leaders of the Democratic Party in or out of\r\nthis Hall--the Seymours, the Woods, the Vallandighams, the Woodwards,\r\nand their indorsers, who hold and control the Democratic Party here, and\r\ntaint it with Treason, till it is a stench in the nostrils of all\r\npatriotic men.\"\r\n\r\nAfter referring to the fact that the leaders of the Rebellion had from\r\nthe start relied confidently upon assistance from the Northern\r\nDemocracy, he proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"The Peace Democracy, and mere Party-hacks in the North, are fulfilling\r\ntheir masters' expectations industriously, unceasingly, and as far as in\r\nthem lies.  Not even the shouts for victory, in these Halls, can divert\r\ntheir Southern allies here.  A sullen gloom at the defeat and\r\ndiscomfiture of their Southern brethren settles down on their disastrous\r\ncountenances, from which no ray of joy can be reflected.  * * *  They\r\neven vote solid against a law to punish guerrillas.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" continued he, \"in my judgment, many of those who withhold from\r\ntheir Country the support they would otherwise give, find allegiance to\r\nParty too strong for their patriotism.  * * *  Rejecting the example and\r\ncounsels of Stanton and Dickinson and Butler and Douglas and Dix and\r\nHolt and Andrew Johnson and Logan and Rosecrans and Grant and a host of\r\nothers, all Democrats of the straightest sect, to forget all other ties,\r\nand cleave only to their Country for their Country's sake, and rejecting\r\nthe overtures and example of the Republican Party to drop and forget\r\ntheir Party name, that all might unite and band together for their\r\nCountry's salvation as Union men, they turn a deaf ear and cold\r\nshoulder, and sullenly pass by on the other side, thanking God they are\r\nnot as other men are, and lend, if at all, a calculating, qualified, and\r\nconditional and halting support, under protest, to their Country's\r\ncause; thus justifying the only hope of the Rebellion to-day, that Party\r\nspirit at the North will distract its counsels, divide and discourage\r\nand palsy its efforts, and ultimately make way for the Traitor and the\r\nparricide to do their worst.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the set speeches made against the proposed\r\nConstitutional amendment in the House, Peace-Democrats of the Senate\r\ncontinued to keep up a running fire at it in that Chamber, on every\r\npossible occasion.  Garrett Davis was especially garrulous on the\r\nsubject, and also launched the thunders of his wrath at the President\r\nquite frequently and even vindictively.  For instance, speaking in the\r\nSenate--[May 31,1864,]--of the right of Property in Slaves; said he:\r\n\r\n\"This new-born heresy 'Military Necessity,' as President Lincoln claims,\r\nand exercises it, is the sum of all political and Military villainies\r\n* * * and it is no less absurd than it is villainous.  * * * The man\r\nhas never spoken or lived who can prove by any provision of the\r\nConstitution, or by any principle, or by any argument to be deduced\r\nlogically and fairly from it, that he has any such power as this vast,\r\ngigantic, all-conquering and all-crushing power of Military Necessity\r\nwhich he has the audacity to claim.\r\n\r\n\"This modern Emperor, this Tiberius, a sort of a Tiberius, and his\r\nSejanus, a sort of a Sejanus, the head of the War Department, are\r\norganizing daily their Military Courts to try civilians.  * * *\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I want one labor of love before I die.  I want the President of\r\nthe United States, I want his Secretary of War, I want some of his high\r\nofficers in Military command to bring a civilian to a Military\r\nexecution, and me to have the proud privilege of prosecuting them for\r\nmurder.  * * * I want the law and its just retribution to be visited\r\nupon these great delinquents.\r\n\r\n\"I would sooner, if I had the power, bring about such an atonement as\r\nthat, than I would even put down the Rebellion.  It would be a greater\r\nvictory in favor of Freedom and Constitutional Liberty, a thousand-fold,\r\nof all the People of America besides, than the subjugation of the Rebel\r\nStates could possibly be.\"\r\n\r\nBut there seemed to be no end to the' attacks upon the Administration,\r\nmade, in both Houses, by these peculiar Peace-Democrats.  Union blood\r\nmight flow in torrents on the fields of the rebellious South, atrocities\r\ninnumerable might be committed by the Rebels, cold-blooded massacres of\r\nBlacks and Whites, as at Fort Pillow, might occur without rebuke from\r\nthem; but let the Administration even dare to sneeze, and--woe to the\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nIt was not the Thirteenth Amendment only, that they assailed, but\r\neverything else which the Administration thought might help it in its\r\neffort to put down the Rebellion.  Nor was it so much their malignant\r\nactivity in opposition to any one measure intended to strengthen the\r\nhands of the Union, but to all such measures; and superadded to this was\r\nthe incessant bringing forward, in both Houses of Congress, by these\r\nrestless Rebel-sympathizers, of Peace-Resolutions, the mere presentation\r\nof which would be, and were, construed by the Rebel authorities at\r\nRichmond, as evidences of a weakening.\r\n\r\nEven some of the best of the Peace-Democrats, like S. S.  Cox, for\r\ninstance, not only assailed the Tariff--under which the Union Republican\r\nParty sought to protect and build up American Industry, as well as to\r\nraise as much revenue as possible to help meet the enormous current\r\nexpenditures of the Government--but also denounced our great paper-money\r\nsystem, which alone enabled us to secure means to meet all deficiencies\r\nin the revenues otherwise obtained, and thus to ultimately conquer the\r\nhosts of Rebellion.\r\n\r\nHe declared (June 2, 1864) that \"The People are the victims of the\r\njoint-robbery of a system of bounties under the guise of duties, and of\r\nan inconvertible and depreciated paper currency under the guise of\r\nmoney,\" and added: \"No man is now so wise and gifted that he can save\r\nthis Nation from bankruptcy.  * * *  No borrowing system can save us.\r\nThe scheme of making greenbacks a legal tender, which enabled the debtor\r\nto cheat his creditor, thereby playing the old game of kingcraft, to\r\ndebase the currency in order to aid the designs of despotism, may float\r\nus for a while amidst the fluctuations and bubbles of the day; but as no\r\none possesses the power to repeal the Law of the Almighty, which decrees\r\n(and as our Constitution has established) that gold and silver shall be\r\nthe standard of value in the World, so they will ever thus remain,\r\nnotwithstanding the legislation of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with this sort of \"fire in the rear,\" it was attempted by\r\nmeans of Democratic Free-Trade and antipaper-currency sophistries, to\r\narouse jealousies, heart-burnings and resentful feelings in the breasts\r\nof those living in different parts of the Union--to implant bitter\r\nSectional antagonisms and implacable resentments between the Eastern\r\nStates, on the one hand, and the Western States, on the other--and thus,\r\nby dividing, to weaken the Loyal Union States.\r\n\r\nThat this was the cold-blooded purpose of all who pursued this course,\r\nwould no doubt be warmly denied by some of them; but the fact remains no\r\nless clear, that the effect of that course, whether so intended or not,\r\nwas to give aid and comfort to the Enemy at that critical time when the\r\nNation most needed all the men, money, and moral as well as material\r\nsupport, it was possible to get, to put an end to the bloody Rebellion,\r\nnow--under the continuous poundings of Grant's Army upon that of Lee in\r\nVirginia, and the advance of Sherman's Army upon that of Johnston in\r\nGeorgia--tottering to its overthrow. Thus this same speaker (S. S. Cox),\r\nin his untimely speech, undertook to divide the Union-loving States\r\n\"into two great classes: the Protected States and the Unprotected\r\nStates;\" and--having declared that \"The Manufacturing States, mainly the\r\nNew England States and Pennsylvania, are the Protected States,\" and \"The\r\nAgricultural States,\" mainly the eleven Western States, which he named,\r\n\"are the Unprotected States\"--proceeded to intemperately and violently\r\narraign New England, and especially Massachusetts, in the same way that\r\nhad years before been adopted by the old Conspirators of the South when\r\nthey sought--alas, too successfully!--to inflame the minds of Southern\r\ncitizens to a condition of unreasoning frenzy which made attempted\r\nNullification and subsequent armed Rebellion and Secession possible.\r\n\r\nWell might the thoroughly loyal Grinnell, of Iowa--after exposing what\r\nhe termed the \"sophistry of figures\" by which Mr. Cox had seen fit \"to\r\nmisrepresent and traduce\" the Western States-exclaim: \"Sir, I have no\r\nwords which I can use to execrate sufficiently such language, in\r\narraying the Sections in opposition during a time of War; as if we were\r\nnot one People, descended from one stock, having one interest, and bound\r\nup in one destiny!\"\r\n\r\nThe damage that might have been done to the Union Cause by such\r\nmalignant Democratic attacks upon the National unity and strength, may\r\nbe imagined when we reflect that at this very time the annual expenses\r\nof our Government were over $600,000,000, and growing still larger; and\r\nthat $1.90 in legal tender notes of the United States was worth but\r\n$1.00 in gold, with a downward tendency.  Said stern old Thaddeus\r\nStevens, alluding on this occasion, to Statesmanship of the peculiar\r\nstamp of the Coxes and Fernando Woods: \"He who in this time will pursue\r\nsuch a course of argument for the mere sake of party, can never hope to\r\nbe ranked among Statesmen; nay, Sir, he will not even rise to the\r\ndignity of a respectable Demagogue!\"\r\n\r\nWithin a week after this, (June 9, 1864), we find in the Senate also,\r\nsimilarly insidious attacks upon the strength of the Government, made by\r\ncertain Northern Democrats, who never tired of undermining Loyalty, and\r\ncreating and spreading discontent among the People.  The Bill then up,\r\nfor consideration, was one \"to prohibit the discharge of persons from\r\nliability to Military duty, by reason of the payment of money.\"\r\n\r\nIn the terribly bloody Campaign that had now been entered upon by Grant\r\n--in the West, under Sherman, and in the East, under his own personal\r\neye--it was essential to send to the front, every man possible.  Hence\r\nthe necessity for a Bill of this sort, which moreover provided, in order\r\nas far as possible to popularize conscription, that all calls for drafts\r\ntheretofore made under the Enrolling Act of March 3, 1863, should be for\r\nnot over one year's service, etc.\r\n\r\nThis furnished the occasion for Mr. Hendricks, among other Peace\r\nDemocrats, to make opposing speeches.  He, it seems, had all along been\r\nopposed to drafting Union soldiers; and because, during the previous\r\nWinter, the Senate had been unwilling to abolish the clause permitting a\r\ndrafted man to pay a commutation of $300 (with which money a substitute\r\ncould be procured) instead of himself going, at a time when men were not\r\nquite so badly needed as now, therefore Mr. Hendricks pretended to think\r\nit very strange and unjustifiable that now, when everything depended on\r\ngetting every possible man in the field, the Senate should think of\r\n\"abandoning that which it thought right last Winter!\"\r\n\r\nHe opposed drafting; but if drafting must be resorted to, then he\r\nthought that what he termed \"the Horror of the Draft\" should be felt by\r\nas many of the Union people as possible!--or, in his own words: \"the\r\nHorror of the Draft ought to be divided among the People.\"  As if this\r\nwere not sufficient to conjure dreadful imaginings, he added: \"if one\r\nset of men are drafted this year to serve twelve months, and they have\r\nto go because the power of the Government makes them go, whether they\r\ncan go well or not, then at the end of the year their neighbors should\r\nbe subjected to the same Horror, and let this dreadful demand upon the\r\nservice, upon the blood, and upon the life of the People be distributed\r\nupon all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in order apparently to still further intensify public feeling\r\nagainst all drafting, and sow the seeds of dissatisfaction in the hearts\r\nof those drafted at this critical time, when the fate of the Union and\r\nof Republican Government palpably depended upon conscription, he added:\r\n\"It is not so right to say to twenty men in a neighborhood: 'You shall\r\ngo; you shall leave your families whether you can or not; you shall go\r\nwithout the privilege of commutation whether you leave starving wives\r\nand children behind you or not,' and then say to every other man of the\r\nneighborhood: 'Because we have taken these twenty men for three years,\r\nyou shall remain with your wives and children safely and comfortably at\r\nhome for these three years.'  I like this feature of the amendment,\r\nbecause it distributes the Horror of the Draft more equally and justly\r\nover the whole People.\"\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with rolling the \"Horror of the Draft\" so often and\r\ntrippingly over his tongue, he also essayed the role of Prophet in the\r\ninterest of the tottering god of Slavery.  \"The People,\" said he,\r\n\"expect great results from this Campaign; and when another year comes\r\nrolling around, and it is found that this War is not closed, and that\r\nthere is no reasonable probability of its early close, my colleague\r\n(Lane) and other Senators who agree with him will find that the People\r\nwill say that this effusion of blood must stop; that THERE MUST BE SOME\r\nADJUSTMENT.  I PROPHESY THIS.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as a further declaration likely to give aid and comfort to the\r\nRebel leaders, he said: \"I do not believe many men are going to be\r\nobtained by a draft; I do not believe a very good Army will be got by a\r\ndraft; I do not believe an Army will be put in the field, by a draft,\r\nthat will whip General Lee.\"\r\n\r\nBut while all such statements were, no doubt, intended to help the foes\r\nof the Union, and dishearten or dismay its friends, the really loyal\r\nPeople, understanding their fell object, paid little heed to them.  The\r\npredictions of these Prophets of evil fell flat upon the ears of lovers\r\nof their Country.  Conspirators, however much they might masquerade in\r\nthe raiment of Loyalty, could not wholly conceal the ear-marks of\r\nTreason.  The hand might be the hand of Esau, but the voice was the\r\nvoice of Jacob.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of June--after a month of terrific and bloody fighting\r\nbetween the immediate forces of Grant and Lee--a dispatch from Sherman,\r\njust received at Washington, was read to the House of Representatives,\r\nwhich said: \"The Enemy is not in our immediate front, but his signals\r\nare seen at Lost Mountain, and Kenesaw.\"  So, at the same time, at the\r\nNational Capital, while the friends of the Union there, were not\r\nimmediately confronted with an armed Enemy, yet the signals of his\r\nAllies could be seen, and their fire upon our rear could be heard, daily\r\nand almost hourly, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThe fight in the House, upon the Thirteenth Amendment, now seemed\r\nindeed, to be reaching a climax.  During the whole of June 14th, until\r\nmidnight, speech after speech on the subject, followed each other in\r\nrapid succession.  Among the opposition speeches, perhaps those of\r\nFernando Wood and Holman were most notable for extravagant and\r\nunreasoning denunciation of the Administration and Party in power--whose\r\nevery effort was put forth, and strained at this very time to the\r\nutmost, to save the Union.\r\n\r\nHolman, for instance, declared that, \"Of all the measures of this\r\ndisastrous Administration, each in its turn producing new calamities,\r\nthis attempt to tamper with the Constitution threatens the most\r\npermanent injury.\"  He enumerated the chief measures of the\r\nAdministration during its three and a half years of power-among them the\r\nEmancipation Proclamation, the arming of the Blacks, and what he\r\nsneeringly termed \"their pet system of finance\" which was to \"sustain\r\nthe public credit for infinite years,\" but which \"even now,\" said he,\r\n\"totters to its fall!\"  And then, having succeeded in convincing himself\r\nof Republican failure, he exultingly exclaimed: \"But why enumerate?\r\nWhat measure of this Administration has failed to be fatal!  Every step\r\nin your progress has been a mistake.  I use the mildest terms of\r\ncensure!\"\r\n\r\nFernando Wood, in his turn also, \"mildly\" remarked upon Republican\r\npolicy as \"the bloody and brutal policy of the Administration Party.\"\r\nHe considered this \"the crisis of the fate of the Union;\" declared that\r\nSlavery was \"the best possible condition to insure the happiness of the\r\nNegro race\"--a position which, on the following day, he \"reaffirmed\"\r\n--and characterized those members of the Democratic Party who saw Treason\r\nin the ways and methods and expressions of Peace Democrats of his own\r\nstamp, as a \"pack of political jackals known as War Democrats.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of June, Farnsworth made a reply to Ross--who had claimed to\r\nbe friendly to the Union soldier--in which the former handled the\r\nDemocratic Party without gloves.  \"What,\" said he, referring to Mr.\r\nRoss, \"has been the course of that gentleman and his Party on this floor\r\nin regard to voting supplies to the Army?  What has been their course in\r\nregard to raising money to pay the Army?  His vote will be found\r\nrecorded in almost every instance against the Appropriation Bills,\r\nagainst ways and means for raising money to pay the Army.  It is only a\r\nweek ago last Monday, that a Bill was introduced here to punish\r\nguerrillas * * *  and how did my colleague vote?  Against the Bill.* * *\r\nOn the subject of arming Slaves, of putting Negroes into the Army, how\r\nhas my colleague and his Party voted?  Universally against it.  They\r\nwould strip from the backs of these Black soldiers, now in the service\r\nof the Country, their uniforms, and would send them back to Slavery with\r\nchains and manacles.  And yet they are the friends of the soldier!\"* * *\r\n\"On the vote to repeal the Fugitive Slave Law, how did that (Democratic)\r\nside of the House vote?  Does not the Fugitive Slave Law affect the\r\nBlack soldier in the Army who was a Slave?  That side of the House are\r\nin favor of continuing the Fugitive Slave Law, and of disbanding Colored\r\ntroops.  How did that side of the House vote on the question of arming\r\nSlaves and paying them as soldiers?  They voted against it.  They are in\r\nfavor of disbanding the Colored regiments, and, armed with the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law, sending them back to their masters!\"\r\n\r\nHe took occasion also to meet various Democratic arguments against the\r\nResolution,--among them, one, hinging on the alleged right of Property\r\nin Slaves.  This was a favorite idea with the Border-State men\r\nespecially, that Slaves were Property--mere chattels as it were,--and,\r\nonly the day before, a Northern man, Coffroth of Pennsylvania, had said:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we should pause before proceeding any further in this\r\nUnconstitutional and censurable legislation.  The mere abolition of\r\nSlavery is not my cause of complaint.  I care not whether Slavery is\r\nretained or abolished by the people of the States in which it exists\r\n--the only rightful authority.  The question to me is, has Congress a\r\nright to take from the people of the South their Property; or, in other\r\nwords, having no pecuniary interest therein, are we justified in freeing\r\nthe Slave-property of others?  Can we Abolish Slavery in the Loyal State\r\nof Kentucky against her will?  If this Resolution should pass, and be\r\nratified by three-fourths of the States--States already Free--and\r\nKentucky refuses to ratify it, upon what principle of right or law would\r\nwe be justified in taking this Slave-property of the people of Kentucky?\r\nWould it be less than stealing?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Farnsworth met this idea--which had also been advanced by Messrs.\r\nRoss, Fernando Wood, and Pruyn--by saying: \"What constitutes property?\r\nI know it is said by some gentlemen on the other side, that what the\r\nstatute makes property, is property.  I deny it.  What 'vested right'\r\nhas any man or State in Property in Man?  We of the North hold property,\r\nnot by virtue of statute law, not by virtue of enactments.  Our property\r\nconsists in lands, in chattels, in things.  Our property was made\r\nproperty by Jehovah when He gave Man dominion over it.  But nowhere did\r\nHe give dominion of Man over Man.  Our title extends back to the\r\nfoundation of the World.  That constitutes property.  There is where we\r\nget our title.  There is where we get our 'vested rights' to property.\"\r\n\r\nTouching the ethics of Slavery, Mr. Arnold's speech on the same occasion\r\nwas also able, and in parts eloquent, as where he said: 'Slavery is\r\nto-day an open enemy striking at the heart of the Republic.  It is the\r\nsoul and body, the spirit and motive of the Rebellion.  It is Slavery\r\nwhich marshals yonder Rebel hosts, which confront the patriot Armies\r\nof Grant and Sherman.  It is the savage spirit of this barbarous\r\nInstitution which starves the Union prisoners at Richmond, which\r\nassassinates them at Fort Pillow, which murders the wounded on the field\r\nof battle, and which fills up the catalogue of wrong and outrage which\r\nmark the conduct of the Rebels during all this War.\r\n\r\n\"In view of all the long catalogue of wrongs which Slavery has inflicted\r\nupon the Country, I demand to-day, of the Congress of the United States,\r\nthe death of African Slavery.  We can have no permanent Peace, while\r\nSlavery lives.  It now reels and staggers toward its last death-struggle.\r\nLet us strike the monster this last decisive blow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, after appealing to both Border-State men, and Democrats of the Free\r\nStates, not to stay the passage of this Resolution which \"will strike\r\nthe Rebellion at the heart,\" he continued: \"Gentlemen may flatter\r\nthemselves with a restoration of the Slave-power in this Country.  'The\r\nUnion as it was!'  It is a dream, never again to be realized.  The\r\nAmerica of the past, has gone forever.  A new Nation is to be born from\r\nthe agony through which the People are now passing.  This new Nation is\r\nto be wholly Free.  Liberty, Equality before the Law, is to be the great\r\nCorner-stone.\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, Mr. Ingersoll eloquently said--among many other good things:\r\n--\"It is well to eradicate an evil.  That Slavery is an evil, no sane,\r\nhonest man will deny.  It has been the great curse of this Country from\r\nits infancy to the present hour, And now that the States in Rebellion\r\nhave given the Loyal States the opportunity to take off that curse, to\r\nwipe away the foul stain, I say let it be done.  We owe it to ourselves;\r\nwe owe it to posterity; we owe it to the Slaves themselves to\r\nexterminate Slavery forever by the adoption of the proposed Amendment to\r\nthe Constitution.  * * *  I believe Slavery is the mother of this\r\nRebellion, that this Rebellion can be attributed to no other cause but\r\nSlavery; from that it derived its life, and gathers its strength to-day.\r\nDestroy the mother, and the child dies.  Destroy the cause, and the\r\neffect will disappear.\r\n\r\n\"Slavery has ever been the enemy of liberal principles.  It has ever\r\nbeen the friend of ignorance, prejudice, and all the unlawful, savage,\r\nand detestable passions which proceed therefrom.  It has ever been\r\ndomineering, arrogant, exacting, and overbearing.  It has claimed to be\r\na polished aristocrat, when in reality it has only been a coarse,\r\nswaggering, and brutal boor.  It has ever claimed to be a gentleman,\r\nwhen in reality it has ever been a villain.  I think it is high time to\r\nclip its overgrown pretensions, strip it of its mask, and expose it, in\r\nall its hideous deformity, to the detestation of all honest and\r\npatriotic men.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Samuel J.  Randall had, at a somewhat later hour, pathetically\r\nand poetically invoked the House, in its collective unity, as a\r\n\"Woodman,\" to \"spare that tree\" of the Constitution, and to \"touch not a\r\nsingle bough,\" because, among other reasons, \"in youth it sheltered\"\r\nhim; and furthermore, because \"the time\" was \"most inopportune;\" and,\r\nafter Mr. Rollins, of Missouri, had made a speech, which he afterward\r\nsuppressed; Mr. Pendleton closed the debate in an able effort, from his\r\npoint of view, in which he objected to the passage of the Joint\r\nResolution because \"the time is not auspicious;\" because, said he, \"it\r\nis impossible that the Amendment proposed, should be ratified without a\r\nfraudulent use of the power to admit new States, or a fraudulent use of\r\nthe Military power of the Federal Government in the Seceded States,\"\r\n--and, said he, \"if you should attempt to amend the Constitution by such\r\nmeans, what binding obligation would it have?\"\r\n\r\nHe objected, also, because \"the States cannot, under the pretense of\r\namending the Constitution, subvert the structure, spirit, and theory of\r\nthis Government.\"  \"But,\" said he, \"if this Amendment were within the\r\nConstitutional power of amendment; if this were a proper time to\r\nconsider it; if three-fourths of the States were willing to ratify it;\r\nand if it did not require the fraudulent use of power, either in this\r\nHouse or in the Executive Department, to secure its adoption, I would\r\nstill resist the passage of this Resolution.  It is another step toward\r\nconsolidation, and consolidation is Despotism; confederation is\r\nLiberty.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon of June 15th, that the House\r\ncame to a vote, on the passage of the Joint Resolution.  At first the\r\nstrain of anxiety on both sides was great, but, as the roll proceeded,\r\nit soon became evident that the Resolution was doomed to defeat.  And so\r\nit transpired.  The vote stood 93 yeas, to 65 nays--Mr. Ashley having\r\nchanged his vote, from the affirmative to the negative, for the purpose\r\nof submitting, at the proper time, a motion to reconsider.\r\n\r\nThat same evening, Mr. Ashley made the motion to reconsider the vote by\r\nwhich the proposed Constitutional Amendment was rejected; and the motion\r\nwas duly entered in the Journal, despite the persistent efforts of\r\nMessrs.  Cox, Holman, and others, to prevent it.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of June, just prior to the Congressional Recess, Mr. Ashley\r\nannounced that he had been disappointed in the hope of securing enough\r\nvotes from the Democratic side of the House to carry the Amendment.\r\n\"Those,\" said he, \"who ought to have been the champions of this great\r\nproposition are unfortunately its strongest opponents.  They have\r\npermitted the golden opportunity to pass.  The record is made up, and we\r\nmust go to the Country on this issue thus presented.\"  And then he gave\r\nnotice that he would call the matter up, at the earliest possible moment\r\nafter the opening of the December Session of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n                      SLAVERY DOOMED AT THE POLLS.\r\n\r\nThe record was indeed made up, and the issue thus made, between Slavery\r\nand Freedom, would be the chief one before the People.  Already the\r\nRepublican National Convention, which met at Baltimore, June 7, 1864,\r\nhad not only with \"enthusiastic unanimity,\" renominated Mr. Lincoln for\r\nthe Presidency, but amid \"tremendous applause,\" the delegates rising and\r\nwaving their hats--had adopted a platform which declared, in behalf of\r\nthat great Party: \"That, as Slavery was the cause, and now constitutes\r\nthe strength, of this Rebellion, and as it must be, always and\r\neverywhere, hostile to the principles of Republican government, Justice\r\nand the National safety demand its utter and complete extirpation from\r\nthe soil of the Republic; and that while we uphold and maintain the Acts\r\nand Proclamations by which the Government, in its own defense, has aimed\r\na death-blow at this gigantic evil, we are in favor, furthermore, of\r\nsuch an Amendment to the Constitution, to be made by the People in\r\nconformity with its provisions, as shall terminate and forever prohibit\r\nthe existence of Slavery within the limits or the jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, with vociferous plaudits, had they received and adopted another\r\nResolution, wherein they declared \"That we approve and applaud the\r\npractical wisdom, the unselfish patriotism and the unswerving fidelity\r\nto the Constitution and the principles of American Liberty, with which\r\nAbraham Lincoln has discharged, under circumstances of unparalleled\r\ndifficulty, the great duties and responsibilities of the Presidential\r\nOffice; that we approve and endorse, as demanded by the emergency, and\r\nessential to the preservation of the Nation, and as within the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution; the Measures and Acts which he has\r\nadopted to defend the Nation against its open and secret foes; that we\r\napprove, especially, the Proclamation of Emancipation, and the\r\nemployment, as Union soldiers, of men heretofore held in Slavery; and\r\nthat we have full confidence in his determination to carry these and all\r\nother Constitutional Measures essential to the salvation of the Country,\r\ninto full and complete effect.\"\r\n\r\nThus heartily, thoroughly and unreservedly, endorsed in all the great\r\nacts of his Administration--and even more emphatically, if possible, in\r\nhis Emancipation policy--by the unanimous vote of his Party, Mr.\r\nLincoln, although necessarily \"chagrined and disappointed\" by the\r\nHouse-vote which had defeated the Thirteenth Amendment, might well feel\r\nundismayed.  He always had implicit faith in the People; he felt sure\r\nthat they would sustain him; and this done, why could not the votes of a\r\ndozen, out of the seventy Congressional Representatives opposing that\r\nAmendment, be changed?  Even failing in this, it must be but a question\r\nof time.  He thought he could afford to bide that time.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of August, the Democratic National Convention met at\r\nChicago.  Horatio Seymour was its permanent President; that same\r\nGovernor of New York whom the 4th of July, 1863, almost at the moment\r\nwhen Vicksburg and Gettysburg had brought great encouragement to the\r\nUnion cause, and when public necessity demanded the enforcement of the\r\nDraft in order to drive the Rebel invader from Northern soil and bring\r\nthe Rebellion speedily to an end--had threateningly said to the\r\nRepublicans, in the course of a public speech, during the Draft-riots at\r\nNew York City: \"Remember this, that the bloody, and treasonable, and\r\nrevolutionary doctrine of public necessity can be proclaimed by a mob as\r\nwell as by a Government.  * * * When men accept despotism, they may have\r\na choice as to who the despot shall be!\"\r\n\r\nIn his speech to this Democratic-Copperhead National Convention,\r\ntherefore, it is not surprising that he should, at this time, declare\r\nthat \"this Administration cannot now save this Union, if it would.\"\r\nThat the body which elected such a presiding officer,--after the bloody\r\nseries of glorious Union victories about Atlanta, Ga., then fast leading\r\nup to the fall of that great Rebel stronghold, (which event actually\r\noccurred long before most of these Democratic delegates, on their\r\nreturn, could even reach their homes)--should adopt a Resolution\r\ndeclaring that the War was a \"failure,\" was not surprising either.\r\n\r\nThat Resolution--\"the material resolution of the Chicago platform,\" as\r\nVallandigham afterward characters it, was written and \"carried through\r\nboth the Subcommittee and the General Committee\" by that Arch-Copperhead\r\nand Conspirator himself.--[See his letter of October 22, 1864, to the\r\neditor of the New York News,]\r\n\r\nIt was in these words: \"Resolved, That this Convention does explicitly\r\ndeclare as the sense of the American People, that after four years of\r\nfailure to restore the Union by the experiment of War, during which,\r\nunder the pretense of a military necessity, or War-power higher than the\r\nConstitution, the Constitution itself has been disregarded in every\r\npart, and public Liberty and private right alike trodden down and the\r\nmaterial prosperity of the Country essentially impaired--Justice,\r\nHumanity, Liberty, and the public welfare demand that immediate efforts\r\nbe made for a cessation of hostilities, with a view to an ultimate\r\nConvention of the States, or other peaceable means, to the end that at\r\nthe earliest practicable moment Peace may be restored on the basis of\r\nthe Federal Union of the States.\"\r\n\r\nWith a Copperhead platform, this Democratic Convention thought it\r\npolitic to have a Union candidate for the Presidency.  Hence, the\r\nnomination of General McClellan; but to propitiate the out-and-out\r\nVallandigham Peace men, Mr. Pendleton was nominated to the second place\r\non the ticket.\r\n\r\nThis combination was almost as great a blunder as was the platform--than\r\nwhich nothing could have been worse.  Farragut's Naval victory at\r\nMobile, and Sherman's capture of Atlanta, followed so closely upon the\r\nadjournment of the Convention as to make its platform and candidates the\r\nlaughing stock of the Nation; and all the efforts of Democratic orators,\r\nand of McClellan himself, in his letter of acceptance, could not prevent\r\nthe rise of that great tidal-wave of Unionism which was soon to engulf\r\nthe hosts of Copperhead-Democracy.\r\n\r\nThe Thanksgiving-services in the churches, and the thundering salutes of\r\n100 guns from every Military and Naval post in the United States, which\r\n--during the week succeeding that Convention's sitting--betokened the\r\nNation's especial joy and gratitude to the victorious Union Forces of\r\nSherman and Farragut for their fortuitously-timed demonstration that the\r\n\"experiment of War\" for the restoration of the Union was anything but a\r\n\"Failure\" all helped to add to the proportions of that rapidly-swelling\r\nvolume of loyal public feeling.\r\n\r\nThe withdrawal from the canvass, of General Fremont, nominated for the\r\nPresidency by the \"radical men of the Nation,\" at Cleveland, also\r\ncontributed to it.  In his letter of withdrawal, September 17th, he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"The Presidential contest has, in effect, been entered upon in such a\r\nway that the union of the Republican Party has become a paramount\r\nnecessity.  The policy of the Democratic Party signifies either\r\nseparation, or reestablishment with Slavery.  The Chicago platform is\r\nsimply separation.  General McClellan's letter of acceptance is\r\nreestablishment, with Slavery.  The Republican candidate is, on the\r\ncontrary, pledged to the reestablishment of the Union without Slavery;\r\nand, however hesitating his policy may be, the pressure of his Party\r\nwill, we may hope, force him to it.  Between these issues, I think no\r\nman of the Liberal Party can remain in doubt.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, following the fall of Atlanta before Sherman's Forces, Grant\r\nhad stormed \"Fort Hell,\" in front of Petersburg; Sheridan had routed the\r\nRebels, under Early, at Winchester, and had again defeated Early at\r\nFisher's Hill; Lee had been repulsed in his attack on Grant's works at\r\nPetersburg; and Allatoona had been made famous, by Corse and his 2,000\r\nUnion men gallantly repulsing the 5,000 men of Hood's Rebel Army, who\r\nhad completely surrounded and attacked them in front, flank, and rear.\r\n\r\nAll these Military successes for the Union Cause helped the Union\r\npolitical campaign considerably, and, when supplemented by the\r\nremarkable results of the October elections in Pennsylvania, Indiana,\r\nand Maryland, made the election of Lincoln and Johnson a foregone\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe sudden death of Chief-Justice Taney, too, happening, by a strange\r\ncoincidence, simultaneously with the triumph of the Union Party of\r\nMaryland in carrying the new Constitution of that State, which\r\nprohibited Slavery within her borders, seemed to have a significance*\r\nnot without its effect upon the public mind, now fast settling down to\r\nthe belief that Slavery everywhere upon the soil of the United States\r\nmust die.\r\n\r\n     [Greeley well said of it: \"His death, at this moment, seemed to\r\n     mark the transition from the Era of Slavery to that of Universal\r\n     Freedom.\"]\r\n\r\nThen came, October 19th, the Battle of Cedar Creek, Va. where the Rebel\r\nGeneral Early, during Sheridan's absence, surprised and defeated the\r\nlatter's forces, until Sheridan, riding down from Winchester, turned\r\ndefeat into victory for the Union Arms, and chased the armed Rebels out\r\nof the Shenandoah Valley forever; and the fights of October 27th and\r\n28th, to the left of Grant's position, at Petersburg, by which the\r\nrailroad communications of Lee's Army at Richmond were broken up.\r\n\r\nAt last, November 8, 1864, dawned the eventful day of election.  By\r\nmidnight of that date it was generally believed, all over the Union,\r\nthat Lincoln and Johnson were overwhelmingly elected, and that the Life\r\nas well as Freedom of the Nation had thus been saved by the People.\r\n\r\nLate that very night, President Lincoln was serenaded by a Pennsylvania\r\npolitical club, and, in responding to the compliment, modestly said:\r\n\r\n\"I earnestly believe that the consequences of this day's work (if it be\r\nas you assure, and as now seems probable) will be to the lasting\r\nadvantage, if not to the very salvation, of the Country.  I cannot at\r\nthis hour say what has been the result of the election.  But whatever it\r\nmay be, I have no desire to modify this opinion, that all who have\r\nlabored to-day in behalf of the Union organization have wrought for the\r\nbest interests of their Country and the World, not only for the present\r\nbut for all future ages.\r\n\r\n\"I am thankful to God,\" continued he, \"for this approval of the People;\r\nbut, while deeply gratified for this mark of their confidence in me, if\r\nI know my heart, my gratitude is free from any taint of personal\r\ntriumph.  I do not impugn the motives of any one opposed to me.  It is\r\nno pleasure to me to triumph over any one; but I give thanks to the\r\nAlmighty for this evidence of the People's resolution to stand by Free\r\nGovernment and the rights of Humanity.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November, in response to another serenade given at the\r\nWhite House, in the presence of an immense and jubilantly enthusiastic\r\ngathering of Union men, by the Republican clubs of the District of\r\nColumbia, Mr. Lincoln said:\r\n\r\n\"It has long been a grave question whether any Government, not too\r\nstrong for the Liberties of its People, can be strong enough to maintain\r\nits existence in great emergencies.  On this point the present\r\nRebellion has brought our Republic to a severe test, and a\r\nPresidential election, occurring in regular course during the Rebellion,\r\nhas added not a little to the strain.  * * *  But the election, along\r\nwith its incidental and undesired strife, has done good, too.  It has\r\ndemonstrated that a People's Government can sustain a National election\r\nin the midst of a great Civil War, until now it has not been known to\r\nthe World that this was a possibility.  It shows, also, how sound and\r\nhow strong we still are.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said he, \"the Rebellion continues; and now that the election is\r\nover, may not all having a common interest reunite in a common effort to\r\nsave our common Country?\r\n\r\n\"For my own part,\" continued he--as the cheering, elicited by this\r\nforcible appeal, ceased--\"I have striven, and shall strive, to avoid\r\nplacing any obstacle in the way.  So long as I have been here I have not\r\nwillingly planted a thorn in any man's bosom.  While I am deeply\r\nsensible to the high compliment of a reelection, and duly grateful, as I\r\ntrust, to Almighty God for having directed my countrymen to a right\r\nconclusion, as I think, for their own good, it adds nothing to my\r\nsatisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or pained by the\r\nresult.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as the renewed cheering evoked by this kindly, Christian utterance\r\ndied away again, he impressively added: \"May I ask those who have not\r\ndiffered with me, to join with me in this same spirit, towards those who\r\nhave?\"\r\n\r\nSo, too, on the 17th of November, in his response to the complimentary\r\naddress of a delegation of Union men from Maryland.\r\n\r\n     [W. H. Purnell, Esq., in behalf of the Committee, delivered an\r\n     address, in which he said they rejoiced that the People, by such an\r\n     overwhelming and unprecedented majority, had again reelected Mr.\r\n     Lincoln to the Presidency and endorsed his course--elevating him to\r\n     the proudest and most honorable position on Earth.  They felt under\r\n     deep obligation to him because he had appreciated their condition\r\n     as a Slave-State.  It was not too much to say that by the exercise\r\n     of rare discretion on his part, Maryland to-day occupies her\r\n     position in favor of Freedom.  Slavery has been abolished therefrom\r\n     by the Sovereign Decree of the People.  With deep and lasting\r\n     gratitude they desired that his Administration, as it had been\r\n     approved in the past, might also be successful in the future, and\r\n     result in the Restoration of the Union, with Freedom as its\r\n     immutable basis.  They trusted that, on retiring from his high and\r\n     honorable position, the universal verdict might be that he deserved\r\n     well of mankind, and that favoring Heaven might 'Crown his days\r\n     with loving kindness and tender mercies.']\r\n\r\nThe same kindly anxiety to soften and dispel the feeling of\r\nbitterness that had been engendered in the malignant bosoms of the\r\nCopperhead-Democracy by their defeat, was apparent when he said with\r\nemphasis and feeling:\r\n\r\n\"I have said before, and now repeat, that I indulge in no feeling of\r\ntriumph over any man who has thought or acted differently from myself.\r\nI have no such feeling toward any living man;\" and again, after\r\ncomplimenting Maryland for doing \"more than double her share\" in the\r\nelections, in that she had not only carried the Republican ticket, but\r\nalso the Free Constitution, he added: \"Those who have differed with us\r\nand opposed us will yet see that the result of the Presidential election\r\nis better for their own good than if they had been successful.\"\r\n\r\nThe victory of the Union-Republican Party at this election was an\r\namazing one, and in the words of General Grant's dispatch of\r\ncongratulation to the President, the fact of its \"having passed off\r\nquietly\" was, in itself, \"a victory worth more to the Country than a\r\nbattle won,\"--for the Copperheads had left no stone unturned in their\r\nefforts to create the utmost possible rancor, in the minds of their\r\npartisans, against the Administration and its Party.\r\n\r\nOf twenty-five States voting, Lincoln and Johnson had carried the\r\nelectoral votes of twenty-two of them, viz.: Maine, New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New York,\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan,\r\nIowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California, Oregon, Kansas, West Virginia,\r\nand Nevada; while McClellan and Pendleton had carried the twenty-one\r\nelectoral votes of the remaining three, viz.: New Jersey, Delaware, and\r\nKentucky--the popular vote reaching the enormous number of 2,216,067 for\r\nLincoln, to 1,808,725 for McClellan--making Lincoln's popular majority\r\n407,342, and his electoral majority 191!\r\n\r\nBut if the figures upon the Presidential candidacy were so gratifying\r\nand surprising to all who held the cause of Union above all others, no\r\nless gratifying and surprising were those of the Congressional\r\nelections, which indicated an entire revulsion of popular feeling on the\r\nsubject of the Administration's policy.  For, while in the current\r\nCongress (the 38th), there were only 106 Republican-Union to 77\r\nDemocratic Representatives, in that for which the elections had just\r\nbeen held, (the 39th), there would be 143 Republican-Union to 41\r\nDemocratic Representatives.\r\n\r\nIt was at once seen, therefore, that, should the existing House of\r\nRepresentatives fail to adopt the Thirteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution, there would be much more than the requisite two-thirds\r\nmajority for such a Measure in both Houses of the succeeding Congress;\r\nand moreover that in the event of its failure at the coming Session, it\r\nwas more than probable that President Lincoln would consider himself\r\njustified in calling an Extra Session of the Thirty-ninth Congress for\r\nthe especial purpose of taking such action.  So far then, as the\r\nprospects of the Thirteenth Amendment were concerned, they looked\r\ndecidedly more encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n                        FREEDOM AT LAST ASSURED.\r\n\r\nAs to the Military situation, a few words are, at this time, necessary:\r\nHood had now marched Northward, with some 50,000 men, toward Nashville,\r\nTenn., while Sherman, leaving Thomas and some 35,000 men behind, to\r\nthwart him, had abandoned his base, and was marching Southward from\r\nAtlanta, through Georgia, toward the Sea.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of November, 1864, General Schofield, in command of the 4th\r\nand 23rd Corps of Thomas's Army, decided to make a stand against Hood's\r\nArmy, at Franklin, in the angle of the Harpeth river, in order to give\r\ntime for the Union supply-trains to cross the river.  Here, with less\r\nthan 20,000 Union troops, behind some hastily constructed works, he had\r\nreceived the impetuous and overwhelming assault of the Enemy--at first\r\nso successful as to threaten a bloody and disastrous rout to the Union\r\ntroops--and, by a brilliant counter-charge, and subsequent obstinate\r\ndefensive-fighting, had repulsed the Rebel forces, with nearly three\r\ntimes the Union losses, and withdrew the next day in safety to the\r\ndefenses of Nashville.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Hood, with his diminished Rebel Army, sat down before\r\nthe lines of Thomas's somewhat augmented Army, which stretched from bank\r\nto bank of the bight of the Cumberland river upon which Nashville is\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\nAnd now a season of intense cold set in, lasting a week or ten days.\r\nDuring this period of apparent inaction on both sides--which aroused\r\npublic apprehension in the North, and greatly disturbed General Grant--I\r\nwas ordered to City Point, by the General-in-Chief, with a view to his\r\ndetailing me to Thomas's Command, at Nashville.\r\n\r\nOn the way, I called on President Lincoln, at the White House.  I found\r\nhim not very well, and with his feet considerably swollen.  He was\r\nsitting on a chair, with his feet resting on a table, while a barber was\r\nshaving him.  Shaking him by the hand, and asking after his health, he\r\nanswered, with a humorous twinkle of the eye, that he would illustrate\r\nhis condition by telling me a story.  Said he: \"Two of my neighbors, on\r\na certain occasion, swapped horses.  One of these horses was large, but\r\nquite thin.  A few days after, on inquiry being made of the man who had\r\nthe big boney horse, how the animal was getting along?--whether\r\nimproving or not?--the owner said he was doing finely; that he had\r\nfattened almost up to the knees already!\"\r\n\r\nAfterward--when, the process of shaving had been completed, we passed to\r\nanother room--our conversation naturally turned upon the War; and his\r\nideas upon all subjects connected with it were as clear as those of any\r\nother person with whom I ever talked.  He had an absolute conviction as\r\nto the ultimate outcome of the War--the final triumph of the Union Arms;\r\nand I well remember, with what an air of complete relief and perfect\r\nsatisfaction he said to me, referring to Grant--\"We have now at the head\r\nof the Armies, a man in whom all the People can have confidence.\"\r\n\r\nBut to return to Military operations: On December 10th? Sherman reached\r\nthe sea-board and commenced the siege of Savannah, Georgia; on the 13th,\r\nFort McAllister was stormed and Sherman's communications opened with the\r\nSea; on the 15th and 16th, the great Battle of Nashville was fought,\r\nbetween the Armies of Thomas and Hood, and a glorious victory gained by\r\nthe Union Arms--Hood's Rebel forces being routed, pursued for days, and\r\npractically dispersed; and, before the year ended, Savannah surrendered,\r\nand was presented to the Nation, as \"a Christmas gift,\" by Sherman.\r\n\r\nAnd now the last Session of the Thirty-eighth Congress having commenced,\r\nthe Thirteenth Amendment might at any time come up again in the House.\r\nIn his fourth and last Annual Message, just sent in to that Body,\r\nPresident Lincoln had said:\r\n\r\n\"At the last Session of Congress a proposed Amendment of the\r\nConstitution abolishing Slavery throughout the United States, passed the\r\nSenate, but failed for lack of the requisite two-thirds vote in the\r\nHouse of Representatives.  Although the present is the same Congress,\r\nand nearly the same members, and without questioning the wisdom or\r\npatriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the\r\nreconsideration and passage of the measure at the present Session.  Of\r\ncourse the abstract question is not changed; but an intervening election\r\nshows, almost certainly, that the next Congress will pass the measure if\r\nthis does not.  Hence there is only a question of time as to when the\r\nproposed Amendment will go to, the States for their action.  And as it\r\nis to so go, at all, events, may we not agree that the sooner the\r\nbetter?  It is not claimed that the election has imposed a duty on\r\nmembers to change their views or their votes, any farther than, as an\r\nadditional element to be considered, their judgment may be affected by\r\nit.  It is the voice of the People now, for the first time, heard upon\r\nthe question.  In a great National crisis like ours, unanimity of action\r\namong those seeking a common end is very desirable--almost\r\nindispensable.  And yet no approach to such unanimity is attainable\r\nunless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority simply\r\nbecause it is the will of the majority.  In this case the common end is\r\nthe maintenance of the Union; and, among the means to secure that end,\r\nsuch will, through the election, is most clearly declared in favor of\r\nsuch Constitutional Amendment.\"\r\n\r\nAfter affirming that, on the subject of the preservation of the Union,\r\nthe recent elections had shown the existence of \"no diversity among the\r\nPeople;\" that \"we have more men now than we had when the War began;\"\r\nthat \"we are gaining strength\" in all ways; and that, after the\r\nevidences given by Jefferson Davis of his unchangeable opposition to\r\naccept anything short of severance from the Union, \"no attempt at\r\nnegotiation with the Insurgent leader could result in any good,\" he\r\nappealed to the other Insurgents to come back to the fold--the door of\r\namnesty and pardon, being still \"open to all.\"  But, he continued:\r\n\r\n\"In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the National\r\nAuthority, on the part of the Insurgents, as the only indispensable\r\ncondition to ending the War, on the part of the Government, I retract\r\nnothing heretofore said as to Slavery.  I repeat the declaration made a\r\nyear ago, that 'while I remain in my present position I shall not\r\nattempt to retract or modify the Emancipation Proclamation, nor shall I\r\nreturn to Slavery any Person who is Free by the terms of that\r\nProclamation, or by any of the Acts of Congress.'  If the People should,\r\nby whatever mode or means, make it an Executive duty to Reenslave such\r\nPersons, another, and not I, must be their instrument to perform it.  In\r\nstating a single condition of Peace I mean simply to say that the War\r\nwill cease on the part of the Government, whenever it shall have ceased\r\non the part of those who began it.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of December, 1864, in accordance with the terms of a\r\nConcurrent Resolution that had passed both Houses, Congress adjourned\r\nuntil January 5, 1865.  During the Congressional Recess, however, Mr.\r\nLincoln, anxious for the fate of the Thirteenth Amendment, exerted\r\nhimself, as it afterward appeared, to some purpose, in its behalf, by\r\ninviting private conferences with him, at the White House, of such of\r\nthe Border-State and other War-Democratic Representatives as had before\r\nvoted against the measure, but whose general character gave him ground\r\nfor hoping that they might not be altogether deaf to the voice of reason\r\nand patriotism.\r\n\r\n     [Among those for whom he sent was Mr. Rollins, of\r\n     Missouri, who afterward gave the following interesting account of\r\n     the interview:\r\n\r\n     \"The President had several times in my presence expressed his deep\r\n     anxiety in favor of the passage of this great measure.  He and\r\n     others had repeatedly counted votes in order to ascertain, as far\r\n     as they could, the strength of the measure upon a second trial in\r\n     the House.  He was doubtful about its passage, and some ten days or\r\n     two weeks before it came up for consideration in the House, I\r\n     received a note from him, written in pencil on a card, while\r\n     sitting at my desk in the House, stating that he wished to see me,\r\n     and asking that I call on him at the White House.  I responded that\r\n     I would be there the next morning at nine o'clock.\r\n\r\n     \"I was prompt in calling upon him and found him alone in his\r\n     office.  He received me in the most cordial manner, and said in his\r\n     usual familiar way: 'Rollins, I have been wanting to talk to you\r\n     for some time about the Thirteenth Amendment proposed to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, which will have to be voted on\r\n     now, before a great while.'\r\n\r\n     \"I said: 'Well, I am here, and ready to talk upon that subject.\r\n\r\n     \"He said: 'You and I were old Whigs, both of us followers of that\r\n     great statesman, Henry Clay, and I tell you I never had an opinion\r\n     upon the subject of Slavery in my life that I did not get from him.\r\n     I am very anxious that the War should be brought to a close at the\r\n     earliest possible date, and I don't believe this can be\r\n     accomplished as long as those fellows down South can rely upon\r\n     the Border-States to help them; but if the Members from the\r\n     Border-States would unite, at least enough of them to pass the\r\n     Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, they would soon see that\r\n     they could not expect much help from that quarter, and be willing\r\n     to give up their opposition and quit their War upon the Government;\r\n     that is my chief hope and main reliance to bring the War to a\r\n     speedy close, and I have sent for you as an old Whig friend to come\r\n     and see me, that I might make an appeal to you to vote for this\r\n     Amendment.  It is going to be very close; a few votes one way or\r\n     the other will decide it.'\r\n\r\n     \"To this, I responded: 'Mr. President, so far as I am concerned,\r\n     you need not have sent for me to ascertain my views on this\r\n     subject, for although I represent perhaps the strongest\r\n     Slave-district in Missouri, and have the misfortune to be one of the\r\n     largest Slave-owners in the country where I reside, I had already\r\n     determined to vote for the Amendment.\r\n\r\n     \"He arose from his chair, and grasping me by the hand, gave it a\r\n     hearty shake, and said: 'I am most delighted to hear that.'\r\n\r\n     \"He asked me how many more of the Missouri delegates in the House\r\n     would vote for it.\r\n\r\n     \"I said I could not tell; the Republicans of course would; General\r\n     Loan, Mr. Blow, Mr. Boyd, and Colonel McClurg.\r\n\r\n     \"He said, 'Won't General Price vote for it?  He is a good Union\r\n     man.' I said I could not answer.\r\n\r\n     \"'Well, what about General King?'\r\n\r\n     \"I told him I did not know.\r\n\r\n     \"He then asked about Judges Hall and Norton.\r\n\r\n     \"I said they would both vote against it, I thought.\r\n\r\n     \"'Well,' he said, 'are you on good terms with Price and King?'\r\n\r\n     \"I responded in the affirmative, and that I was on easy terms with\r\n     the entire delegation.\r\n\r\n     \"He then asked me if I would not talk with those who might be\r\n     persuaded to vote for the amendment, and report to him as soon as I\r\n     could find out what the prospect was.'\r\n\r\n     \"I answered that I would do so with pleasure, and remarked at the\r\n     same time, that when I was a young man, in 1848, I was the Whig\r\n     competitor of King for Governor of Missouri, and, as he beat me\r\n     very badly, I thought now he should pay me back by voting as I\r\n     desired him on this important question.\r\n\r\n     \"I promised the President I would talk to this gentleman upon the\r\n     subject.\r\n\r\n     \"He said: 'I would like you to talk to all the Border-State men\r\n     whom you can approach properly, and tell them of my anxiety to have\r\n     the measure pass; and let me know the prospect of the Border-State\r\n     vote,' which I promised to do.\r\n\r\n     \"He again said: 'The passage of this Amendment will clinch the\r\n     whole subject; it will bring the War, I have no doubt, rapidly to a\r\n     close.'\"--Arnold's Life of Lincoln, pp. 358-359,]\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of January, 1865, the Christmas Recess having expired,\r\nCongress re-assembled.  The motion to reconsider the vote-by which the\r\nJoint Resolution, to amend the Constitution by the abolition of Slavery,\r\nhad been defeated--was not called up, on that day, as its friends had\r\nnot all returned; but the time was mainly consumed in able speeches, by\r\nMr. Creswell of Maryland, and Stevens of Pennsylvania, in which the\r\nformer declared that \"whether we would or not, we must establish Freedom\r\nif we would exterminate Treason.  Events have left us no choice.  The\r\nPeople have learned their duty and have instructed us accordingly.\"  And\r\nMr. Thaddeus Stevens solemnly said: \"We are about to ascertain the\r\nNational will, by another vote to amend the Constitution.  If gentlemen\r\nopposite will yield to the voice of God and Humanity, and vote for it, I\r\nverily believe the sword of the Destroying Angel will be stayed, and\r\nthis People be reunited.  If we still harden our hearts, and blood must\r\nstill flow, may the ghosts of the slaughtered victims sit heavily upon\r\nthe souls of those who cause it!\"\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of January, Mr. Ashley called up his motion to reconsider the\r\nvote defeating the Thirteenth Amendment, and opened the debate with a\r\nlengthy and able speech in favor of that measure, in concluding which he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"The genius of history, with iron pen, is waiting to record our verdict\r\nwhere it will remain forever for all the coming generations of men to\r\napprove or condemn.  God grant that this verdict may be one over which\r\nthe friends of Liberty, impartial and universal, in this Country and\r\nEurope, and in every Land beneath the sun, may rejoice; a verdict which\r\nshall declare that America is Free; a verdict which shall add another\r\nday of jubilee, and the brightest of all, to our National calendar.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate was participated in by nearly all the prominent men, on both\r\nsides of the House--the speeches of Messrs. Cox, Brooks, Voorhees,\r\nMallory, Holman, Woods and Pendleton being the most notable, in\r\nopposition to, and those of Scofield, Rollins, Garfield and Stevens,\r\nin favor of, the Amendment.  That of Scofield probably stirred up \"the\r\nadversary\" more thoroughly than any other; that of Rollins was more\r\ncalculated to conciliate and capture the votes of hesitating, or\r\nBorder-State men; that of Garfield was perhaps the most scholarly and\r\neloquent; while that of Stevens was remarkable for its sledge-hammer\r\npungency and characteristic brevity.\r\n\r\nMr. Pendleton, toward the end of his speech, had said of Mr. Stevens:\r\n\"Let him be careful, lest when the passions of these times be passed\r\naway, and the historian shall go back to discover where was the original\r\ninfraction of the Constitution, he may find that sin lies at the door of\r\nothers than the people now in arms.\"  And it was this that brought the\r\nsterling old Patriot again to his feet, in vindication of the acts of\r\nhis liberty-inspired life, and in defense of the power to amend the\r\nConstitution, which had been assailed.\r\n\r\nThe personal antithesis with which he concluded his remarks was in\r\nitself most dramatically effective, Said he:\r\n\r\n\"So far as the appeals of the learned gentleman (Mr. Pendleton) are\r\nconcerned, in his pathetic winding up, I will be willing to take my\r\nchance, when we all moulder in the dust.  He may have his epitaph\r\nwritten, if it be truly written, 'Here rests the ablest and most\r\npertinacious defender of Slavery, and opponent of Liberty;' and I will\r\nbe satisfied if my epitaph shall be written thus: 'Here lies one who\r\nnever rose to any eminence, and who only courted the low ambition to\r\nhave it said that he had striven to ameliorate the condition of the\r\npoor, the lowly, the downtrodden, of every race, and language, and\r\ncolor.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said these words, the crowded floors and galleries broke out into\r\ninvoluntary applause for the grand \"Old Commoner\"--who only awaited its\r\ncessation, to caustically add: \"I shall be content, with such a eulogy\r\non his lofty tomb and such an inscription on my humble grave, to trust\r\nour memories to the judgment of after ages.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate, frequently interrupted by Appropriation Bills, and other\r\nimportant and importunate measures, lasted until the 31st of January,\r\nwhen Mr. Ashley called the previous question on his motion to\r\nreconsider.\r\n\r\nMr. Stiles at once moved to table the motion to reconsider.  Mr.\r\nStiles's motion was lost by 57 yeas to 111 nays.  This was in the nature\r\nof a test-vote, and the result, when announced, was listened to, with\r\nbreathless attention, by the crowded House and galleries.  It was too\r\nclose for either side to be satisfied; but it showed a gain to the\r\nfriends of the Amendment; that was something.  How the final vote would\r\nbe, none could tell.  Meanwhile it was known, from the announcements on\r\nthe floor, that Rogers was absent through his own illness and Voorhees\r\nthrough illness in his family.\r\n\r\nThe previous question being seconded and the main question ordered, the\r\nyeas and nays were called on the motion to reconsider--and the intense\r\nsilence succeeding the monotonous calling of the names was broken by the\r\nvoice of the Speaker declaring the motion to reconsider, carried, by 112\r\nyeas to 57 nays.\r\n\r\nThis vote created a slight sensation.  There was a gain of one,\r\n(English), at any rate, from among those not voting on the previous\r\nmotion.  Now, if there should be but the change of a single vote, from\r\nthe nays to the yeas, the Amendment would be carried!\r\n\r\nThe most intensely anxious solicitude was on nearly every face, as Mr.\r\nMallory, at this critical moment, made the point of order that \"a vote\r\nto reconsider the vote by which the subject now before the House was\r\ndisposed of, in June last, requires two-thirds of this Body,\" and\r\nemphatically added: \"that two-thirds vote has not been obtained.\"\r\n\r\nA sigh of relief swept across the galleries, as the Speaker overruled\r\nthe point of order.  Other attempted interruptions being resolutely met\r\nand defeated by Mr. Ashley, in charge of the Resolution, the \"previous\r\nquestion\" was demanded, seconded, and the main question ordered--which\r\nwas on the passage of the Resolution.\r\n\r\nAnd now, amid the hush of a breathless and intent anxiety--so absolute\r\nthat the scratch of the recording pencil could be heard--the Clerk\r\ncommenced to call the roll!\r\n\r\nSo consuming was the solicitude, on all sides, for the fate of this\r\nportentous measure, that fully one-half the Representatives kept tally\r\nat their desks as the vote proceeded, while the heads of the gathered\r\nthousands of both sexes, in the galleries, craned forward, as though\r\nfearing to lose the startlingly clear responses, while the roll-call\r\nprogressed.\r\n\r\nWhen it reached the name of English--Governor English, a Connecticut\r\nDemocrat, who had not voted on the first motion, to table the motion to\r\nreconsider, but had voted \"yea\" on the motion to reconsider,--and he\r\nresponded with a clear-cut \"aye\" on the passage of the Resolution--it\r\nlooked as though light were coming at last, and applause involuntarily\r\nbroke forth from the Republican side of the floor, spreading instantly\r\nto the galleries, despite the efforts of the Speaker to preserve order.\r\n\r\nSo, when Ganson of New York, and other Democrats, voted \"aye,\" the\r\napplause was renewed again and again, and still louder again, when, with\r\nsmiling face--which corroborated the thrilling, fast-spreading, whisper,\r\nthat \"the Amendment is safe!\"--Speaker Colfax directed the Clerk to call\r\nhis name, as a member of the House, and, in response to that call, voted\r\n\"aye!\"\r\n\r\nThen came dead silence, as the Clerk passed the result to the Speaker\r\n--during which a pin might have been heard to drop,--broken at last by the\r\nSpeaker's ringing voice: \"The Constitutional majority of two-thirds\r\nhaving voted in the affirmative, the Joint Resolution is passed.\"\r\n\r\n     [The enrolled Resolution received the approval and signature of the\r\n     President, Feb. 1, 1865,]\r\n\r\nThe words had scarcely left the Speaker's lips, when House and galleries\r\nsprang to their feet, clapping their hands, stamping their feet, waving\r\nhats and handkerchiefs, and cheering so loudly and so long that it\r\nseemed as if this great outburst of enthusiasm--indulged in, in defiance\r\nof all parliamentary rules--would never cease!\r\n\r\nIn his efforts to control it, Speaker Colfax hammered the desk until he\r\nnearly broke his mallet.  Finally, by 4 o'clock, P.M., after several\r\nminutes of useless effort--during which the pounding of the mallet was\r\nutterly lost in the noisy enthusiasm and excitement, in which both the\r\nFreedom-loving men and women of the Land, there present, participated\r\n--the Speaker at last succeeded in securing a lull.\r\n\r\nAdvantage was instantly taken of it, by the successor of the dead Owen\r\nLovejoy, Mr. Ingersoll of Illinois, his young face flushing with the\r\nglow of patriotism, as he cried: \"Mr. Speaker!  In honor of this\r\nImmortal and Sublime Event I move that the House do now adjourn.\"  The\r\nSpeaker declared the motion carried, amid renewed demonstrations of\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nDuring all these uncontrollable ebullitions of popular feeling in behalf\r\nof personal Liberty and National Freedom and strength, the Democratic\r\nmembers of the House had sat, many of them moving uneasily in their\r\nseats, with chagrin painted in deep lines upon their faces, while others\r\nwere bolt upright, as if riveted to their chairs, looking straight\r\nbefore them at the Speaker, in a vain attempt, belied by the pallid\r\nanger of their set countenances, to appear unconscious of the storm of\r\npopular feeling breaking around them, which they now doggedly perceived\r\nmight be but a forecast of the joyful enthusiasm which on that day, and\r\non the morrow, would spread from one end of the Land to the other.\r\n\r\nHarris, of Maryland, made a sort of \"Last Ditch\" protest against\r\nadjournment, by demanding the \"yeas and nays\" on the motion to adjourn.\r\nThe motion was, however, carried, by 121 yeas to 24 nays; and, as the\r\nmembers left their places in the Hall--many of them to hurry with their\r\nhearty congratulations to President Lincoln at the White House--the\r\ntriumph, in the Halls of our National Congress, of Freedom and Justice\r\nand Civilization, over Slavery and Tyranny and Barbarism, was already\r\nbeing saluted by the booming of one hundred guns on Capitol Hill.\r\n\r\nHow large a share was Mr. Lincoln's, in that triumph, these pages have\r\nalready sufficiently indicated.  Sweet indeed must have been the joy\r\nthat thrilled his whole being, when, sitting in the White House, he\r\nheard the bellowing artillery attest the success of his labors in behalf\r\nof Emancipation.  Proud indeed must he have felt when, the following\r\nnight, in response to the loud and jubilant cries of \"Lincoln!\"\r\n\"Lincoln!\" \"Abe Lincoln!\" \"Uncle Abe!\" and other affectionate calls,\r\nfrom a great concourse of people who, with music, had assembled outside\r\nthe White House to give him a grand serenade and popular ovation, he\r\nappeared at an open window, bowed to the tumult of their acclamations,\r\nand declared that \"The great Job is ended!\"--adding, among other things,\r\nthat the occasion was one fit for congratulation, and, said he, \"I\r\ncannot but congratulate all present--myself, the Country, and the whole\r\nWorld--upon this great moral victory. * * * This ends the Job!\"\r\n\r\nSubstantially the job was ended.  There was little doubt, after such a\r\nsend off, by the President and by Congress, in view of the character of\r\nthe State Legislatures, as well as the temper of the People, that the\r\nrequisite number of States would be secured to ratify the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment.  Already, on the 1st of February, that is to say, on the very\r\nday of this popular demonstration at the Executive Mansion, the\r\nPresident's own State, Illinois, had ratified it--and this circumstance\r\nadded to the satisfaction and happiness which beamed from, and almost\r\nmade beautiful, his homely face.\r\n\r\nOther States quickly followed; Maryland, on February 1st and 3rd; Rhode\r\nIsland and Michigan, on February 2nd; New York, February 2nd and 3rd;\r\nWest Virginia, February 3rd; Maine and Kansas, February 7th;\r\nMassachusetts and Pennsylvania, February 8th; Virginia, February 9th;\r\nOhio and Missouri, February 10th; Nevada and Indiana, February 16th;\r\nLouisiana, February 17th; Minnesota, February 8th and 23rd; Wisconsin,\r\nMarch 1st; Vermont, March 9th; Tennessee, April 5th and 7th; Arkansas,\r\nApril 20th; Connecticut, May 5th; New Hampshire, July 1st; South\r\nCarolina, November 13th; Alabama, December 2nd; North Carolina, December\r\n4th; Georgia, December 9th; Oregon, December 11th; California, December\r\n20th; and Florida, December 28th;--all in 1865; with New Jersey, closely\r\nfollowing, on January 23rd; and Iowa, January 24th;--in 1866.\r\n\r\nLong ere this last date, however, the Secretary of State (Mr. Seward)\r\nhad been able to, and did, announce (November 18, 1865) the ratification\r\nof the Amendment by the requisite number of States, and certified that\r\nthe same had \"become, to all intents and purposes, valid as a part of\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nNot until then, was \"the job\" absolutely ended; but, as has been already\r\nmentioned, it was, at the time Mr. Lincoln spoke, as good as ended.  It\r\nwas a foregone conclusion, that the great end for which he, and so many\r\nother great and good men of the Republic had for so many years been\r\nearnestly striving, would be an accomplished fact.  They had not failed;\r\nthey had stood firm; the victory which he had predicted six years before\r\nhad come!\r\n\r\n     [He had said in his Springfield speech, of 1858: \"We\r\n     shall not fail; if we stand firm we shall not fail; wise counsels\r\n     may accelerate, or mistakes delay, but sooner or later the Victory\r\n     is sure to come.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n                     LINCOLN'S SECOND INAUGURATION.\r\n\r\nWhile the death of Slavery in America was decreed, as we have seen; yet,\r\nthe sanguine anticipations of Mr. Lincoln, and other friends of Freedom,\r\nthat such a decree, imperishably grafted into the Constitution, must at\r\nonce end the Rebellion, and bring Peace with a restored Union, were not\r\nrealized.  The War went on.  Grant was still holding Lee, at Petersburg,\r\nnear Richmond, while Sherman's victorious Army was about entering upon a\r\ncampaign from Savannah, up through the Carolinas.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous Summer, efforts had been made, by Horace Greeley,\r\nand certain parties supposed to represent the Rebel authorities, to lay\r\nthe ground-work for an early Peace and adjustment of the differences\r\nbetween the Government of the United States and the Rebels, but they\r\nmiscarried.  They led, however, to the publication of the following\r\nimportant conciliatory Presidential announcement:\r\n\r\n                              \"EXECUTIVE MANSION,\r\n                              \"WASHINGTON, July 18, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"To whom it may concern:\r\n\r\n\"Any proposition which embraces the restoration of Peace, the integrity\r\nof the whole Union, and the abandonment of Slavery, and which comes by\r\nand with an authority that can control the Armies now at War against the\r\nUnited States, will be received and considered by the Executive\r\nGovernment of the United States, and will be met by liberal terms on\r\nsubstantial and collateral points; and the bearer or bearers thereof\r\nshall have safe conduct both ways.\r\n\r\n\"(Signed) ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, other efforts were being made, with a similar\r\nobject in view, but which came to naught.  The visit of Messrs. Jacques\r\nand Gilmore to the Rebel Capital on an informal Peace-errand was, at\r\nleast, valuable in this, that it secured from the head and front of the\r\narmed Conspiracy, Jefferson Davis himself, the following definite\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\"I desire Peace as much as you do; I deplore bloodshed as much as you\r\ndo; but I feel that not one drop of the blood shed in this War is on my\r\nhands.  I can look up to my God and say this.  I tried all in my power\r\nto avert this War.  I saw it coming, and for twelve years I worked night\r\nand day to prevent it; but I could not.  The North was mad and blind; it\r\nwould not let us govern ourselves; and so the War came: and now it must\r\ngo on till the last man of this generation falls in his tracks, and his\r\nchildren seize his musket and fight our battle, unless you acknowledge\r\nour right to self-government.  We are not fighting for Slavery.  We are\r\nfighting for INDEPENDENCE; and that, or EXTERMINATION, we WILL have.\"\r\n\r\n     [The Nation, July 2, 1885, contained the following\r\n     remarks, which may be pertinently quoted in support of this\r\n     authoritative statement that the South was \"not fighting for\r\n     Slavery,\" but for Independence--that is to say: for Power, and what\r\n     would flow from it.]\r\n\r\n     [\"The Charleston News and Courier a fortnight ago remarked that\r\n     'not more than one Southern soldier in ten or fifteen was a\r\n     Slaveholder, or had any interest in Slave Property.'  The\r\n     Laurensville Herald disputed the statement, and declared that 'the\r\n     Southern Army was really an Army of Slaveholders and the sons of\r\n     Slaveholders.'  The Charleston paper stands by its original\r\n     position, and cites figures which are conclusive.  The Military\r\n     population of the eleven States which seceded, according to the\r\n     census of 1860, was 1,064,193.  The entire number of Slaveholders\r\n     in the Country at the same time was 383,637, but of these 77,335\r\n     lived in the Border States, so that the number in the Seceding\r\n     States was only 306,302.  Most of the small Slaveholders, however,\r\n     were not Slave-owners, but Slave hirers, and Mr. De Bow, the\r\n     statistician who supervised the census of 1850, estimated that but\r\n     little over half the holders were actually owners.  The proportion\r\n     of owners diminished between 1850 and 1860, and the News and\r\n     Courier thinks that there were not more than 150,000 Slave-owners\r\n     in the Confederate States when the War broke out.  This would be\r\n     one owner to every seven White males between eighteen and\r\n     forty-five; but as many of the owners were women, and many of the\r\n     men were relieved from Military service, the Charleston paper is\r\n     confirmed in its original opinion that there were ten men in the\r\n     Southern Army who were not Slave-owners for every soldier who had\r\n     Slaves of his own.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd when these self-constituted Peace-delegates had fulfilled the duty\r\nwhich their zeal had impelled them to perform, and were taking their\r\nleave of the Rebel chieftain, Jefferson Davis added:\r\n\r\n\"Say to Mr. Lincoln, from me, that I shall at any time be pleased to\r\nreceive proposals for PEACE on the basis of our INDEPENDENCE.  It will\r\nbe useless to approach me with any other.\"\r\n\r\nThus the lines had been definitely and distinctly drawn, on both sides.\r\nThe issue of Slavery became admittedly, as between the Government and\r\nthe Rebels, a dead one.  The great cardinal issue was now clearly seen\r\nand authoritatively admitted to be, \"the integrity of the whole Union\"\r\non the one side, and on the other, \"Independence of a part of it.\"\r\nThese precise declarations did great good to the Union Cause in the\r\nNorth, and not only helped the triumphant re-election of Mr. Lincoln,\r\nbut also contributed to weaken the position of the Northern advocates of\r\nSlavery, and to bring about, as we have seen, the extinction of that\r\ninherited National curse, by Constitutional Amendment.\r\n\r\nDuring January, of 1865, Francis P. Blair having been permitted to pass\r\nboth the Union and Rebel Army lines, showed to Mr. Lincoln a letter,\r\nwritten to the former, by Jefferson Davis--and which the latter had\r\nauthorized him to read to the President--stating that he had always\r\nbeen, and was still, ready to send or to receive Commissioners \"to enter\r\ninto a Conference, with a view to secure Peace to the two Countries.\"\r\nOn the 18th of that month, purposing to having it shown to Jefferson\r\nDavis, Mr. Lincoln wrote to Mr. Blair a letter in which, after referring\r\nto Mr. Davis, he said: \"You may say to him that I have constantly been,\r\nam now, and shall continue, ready to receive any agent whom he, or any\r\nother influential person now resisting the National Authority, may\r\ninformally send to me, with the view of securing Peace to the People of\r\nour common Country.\"  On the 21st of January, Mr. Blair was again in\r\nRichmond; and Mr. Davis had read and retained Mr. Lincoln's letter to\r\nBlair, who specifically drew the Rebel chieftain's attention to the fact\r\nthat \"the part about 'our common Country' related to the part of Mr.\r\nDavis's letter about 'the two Countries,' to which Mr. Davis replied\r\nthat he so understood it.\"  Yet subsequently, he sent Messrs.  Alexander\r\nH.  Stephens, R. M. T.  Hunter, and John A.  Campbell as Commissioners,\r\nwith instructions, (January 28, 1865,) which, after setting forth the\r\nlanguage of Mr. Lincoln's letter, proceeded strangely enough to say: \"In\r\nconformity with the letter of Mr. Lincoln, of which the foregoing is a\r\ncopy, you are to proceed to Washington city for informal Conference with\r\nhim upon the issues involved in the existing War, and for the purpose of\r\nsecuring Peace to the two Countries!\"  The Commissioners themselves\r\nstated in writing that \"The substantial object to be obtained by the\r\ninformal Conference is, to ascertain upon what terms the existing War\r\ncan be terminated honorably.  * * * Our earnest desire is, that a just\r\nand honorable Peace may be agreed upon, and we are prepared to receive\r\nor to submit propositions which may, possibly, lead to the attainment of\r\nthat end.\"  In consequence of this peculiarly \"mixed\" overture, the\r\nPresident sent Secretary Seward to Fortress Monroe, to informally confer\r\nwith the parties, specifically instructing him to \"make known to them\r\nthat three things are indispensable, to wit:\r\n\r\n\"1.  The restoration of the National Authority throughout all the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\"2.  No receding, by the Executive of the United States, on the Slavery\r\nquestion, from the position assumed thereon in the late Annual Message\r\nto Congress, and in preceding documents.\r\n\r\n\"3.  No cessation of hostilities short of an end of the War and the\r\ndisbanding of all forces hostile to the Government.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln also instructed the Secretary to \"inform them that all\r\npropositions of theirs, not inconsistent with the above, will be\r\nconsidered and passed upon in a spirit of sincere liberality;\" to \"hear\r\nall they may choose to say, and report it\" to him, and not to \"assume to\r\ndefinitely consummate anything.\"  Subsequently, the President, in\r\nconsequence of a dispatch from General Grant to Secretary Stanton,\r\ndecided to go himself to Fortress Monroe.\r\n\r\n     Following is the dispatch:\r\n\r\n     [In Cipher]\r\n\r\n     OFFICE UNITED STATES MILITARY TELEGRAPH.  WAR DEPARTMENT.\r\n\r\n     \"The following telegram received at Washington, 4.35 A.M., February\r\n     2, 1865.  From City Point, Va., February 1, 10.30 P.M., 1865\r\n\r\n     \"Now that the interview between Major Eckert, under his written\r\n     instructions, and Mr. Stephens and party has ended, I will state\r\n     confidentially, but not officially, to become a matter of record,\r\n     that I am convinced, upon conversation with Messrs. Stephens and\r\n     Hunter, that their intentions are good and their desire sincere to\r\n     restore Peace and Union.  I have not felt myself at liberty to\r\n     express, even, views of my own, or to account for my reticency.\r\n     This has placed me in an awkward position, which I could have\r\n     avoided by not seeing them in the first instance.  I fear now their\r\n     going back without any expression from any one in authority will\r\n     have a bad influence.  At the same time I recognize the\r\n     difficulties in the way of receiving these informal Commissioners\r\n     at this time, and do not know what to recommend.  I am sorry,\r\n     however, that Mr. Lincoln cannot have an interview with the two\r\n     named in this dispatch, if not all three now within our lines.\r\n     Their letter to me was all that the President's instructions\r\n     contemplated to secure their safe conduct, if they had used the\r\n     same language to Major Eckert.\r\n\r\n                                   \"U. S. GRANT,\r\n                                   \"Lieutenant General.\r\n\r\n     \"Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n     \"Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Stephens is stated by a Georgia paper to have repeated the\r\n     following characteristic anecdote of what occurred during the\r\n     interview.  \"The three Southern gentlemen met Mr. Lincoln and Mr.\r\n     Seward, and after some preliminary remarks, the subject of Peace\r\n     was opened.  Mr. Stephens, well aware that one who asks much may\r\n     get more than he who confesses to humble wishes at the outset,\r\n     urged the claims of his Section with that skill and address for\r\n     which the Northern papers have given him credit.  Mr. Lincoln,\r\n     holding the vantage ground of conscious power, was, however,\r\n     perfectly frank, and submitted his views almost in the form of an\r\n     argument.  * * * Davis had, on this occasion, as on that of Mr.\r\n     Stephens's visit to Washington, made it a condition that no\r\n     Conference should be had unless his rank as Commander or President\r\n     should first be recognized.  Mr. Lincoln declared that the only\r\n     ground on which he could rest the justice of War--either with his\r\n     own people, or with foreign powers--was that it was not a War for\r\n     conquest, for that the States had never been separated from the\r\n     Union.  Consequently, he could not recognize another Government\r\n     inside of the one of which he alone was President; nor admit the\r\n     separate Independence of States that were yet a part of the Union.\r\n     'That' said he 'would be doing what you have so long asked Europe\r\n     to do in vain, and be resigning the only thing the Armies of the\r\n     Union have been fighting for.'  Mr. Hunter made a long reply to\r\n     this, insisting that the recognition of Davis's power to make a\r\n     Treaty was the first and indispensable step to Peace, and referred\r\n     to the correspondence between King Charles I., and his Parliament,\r\n     as a trustworthy precedent of a Constitutional ruler treating with\r\n     Rebels.  Mr. Lincoln's face then wore that indescribable expression\r\n     which generally preceded his hardest hits, and he remarked: 'Upon\r\n     questions of history I must refer you to Mr. Seward, for he is\r\n     posted in such things, and I don't pretend to be bright.  My only\r\n     distinct recollection of the matter is that Charles lost his head,'\r\n     That settled Mr. Hunter for a while.\" Arnold's Lincoln, p. 400.\r\n\r\nOn the night of February 2nd, Mr. Lincoln reached Hampton Roads, and\r\njoined Secretary Seward on board a steamer anchored off the shore.  The\r\nnext morning, from another steamer, similarly anchored, Messrs.\r\nStephens, Hunter, and Campbell were brought aboard the President's\r\nsteamer and a Conference with the President and Secretary of several\r\nhours' duration was the result.  Mr. Lincoln's own statement of what\r\ntranspired was in these words:\r\n\r\n\"No question of preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or\r\nmentioned.  No other person was present; no papers were exchanged or\r\nproduced; and it was, in advance, agreed that the conversation was to be\r\ninformal and verbal merely.  On our part, the whole substance of the\r\ninstructions to the Secretary of State, hereinbefore recited, was stated\r\nand insisted upon, and nothing was said inconsistent therewith; while,\r\nby the other party, it was not said that in any event or on any\r\ncondition, they ever would consent to Re-union; and yet they equally\r\nomitted to declare that they never would so consent.  They seemed to\r\ndesire a postponement of that question, and the adoption of some other\r\ncourse first, which, as some of them seemed to argue, might or might not\r\nlead to Reunion; but which course, we thought, would amount to an\r\nindefinite postponement.  The Conference ended without result.\"\r\n\r\nIn his communication to the Rebel Congress at Richmond, February 6.\r\n1865, Jefferson Davis, after mentioning his appointment of Messrs.\r\nStephens, Hunter and Campbell, for the purpose stated, proceeded to say:\r\n\r\n\"I herewith transmit, for the information of Congress, the report of the\r\neminent citizens above named, showing that the Enemy refused to enter\r\ninto negotiations with the Confederate States, or any one of them\r\nseparately, or to give to our people any other terms or guarantees than\r\nthose which the conqueror may grant, or to permit us to have Peace on\r\nany other basis than our unconditional submission to their rule, coupled\r\nwith the acceptance of their recent legislation on the subject of the\r\nrelations between the White and Black population of each State.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th and 9th of February, public meetings were held at Richmond,\r\nin connection with these Peace negotiations.  At the first, Jefferson\r\nDavis made a speech in which the Richmond Dispatch reported him as\r\nemphatically asserting that no conditions of Peace \"save the\r\nIndependence of the Confederacy could ever receive his sanction.  He\r\ndoubted not that victory would yet crown our labors, * * * and sooner\r\nthan we should ever be united again he would be willing to yield up\r\neverything he had on Earth, and if it were possible would sacrifice a\r\nthousand lives before he would succumb.\"  Thereupon the meeting of\r\nRebels passed resolutions \"spurning\" Mr. Lincoln's terms \"with the\r\nindignation due to so gross an insult;\" declared that the circumstances\r\nconnected with his offer could only \"add to the outrage and stamp it as\r\na designed and premeditated indignity\" offered to them; and invoking\r\n\"the aid of Almighty God\" to carry out their \"resolve to maintain\" their\r\n\"Liberties and Independence\"--to which, said they, \"we mutually pledge\r\nour lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\"  So too, at the second\r\nof these meetings, presided over by R. M. T. Hunter, and addressed by\r\nthe Rebel Secretary Judah P. Benjamin, resolutions were adopted amid\r\n\"wild and long continued cheering,\" one of which stated that they would\r\n\"never lay down\" their \"arms until\" their \"Independence\" had \"been won,\"\r\nwhile another declared a full confidence in the sufficiency of their\r\nresources to \"conduct the War successfully and to that issue,\" and\r\ninvoked \"the People, in the name of the holiest of all causes, to spare\r\nneither their blood nor their treasure in its maintenance and support.\"\r\n\r\nAs during these Peace negotiations, General Grant, by express direction\r\nof President Lincoln, had not changed, hindered, nor delayed, any of his\r\n\"Military movements or plans,\" so, now that the negotiations had failed,\r\nthose Military movements were pressed more strenuously than ever.\r\n\r\n     [The main object of this Conference on the part of the Rebels was\r\n     to secure an immediate truce, or breathing spell, during which they\r\n     could get themselves in better condition for continuing the War.\r\n     Indeed a portion of Mr. Seward's letter of Feb. 7, 1865, to Mr.\r\n     Adams, our Minister at the Court of St. James, giving him an\r\n     account of the Conference with the party of Insurgent\r\n     Commissioners, would not alone indicate this, but also that it was\r\n     proposed by that \"Insurgent party,\" that both sides, during the\r\n     time they would thus cease to fight one another, might profitably\r\n     combine their forces to drive the French invaders out of Mexico and\r\n     annex that valuable country.  At least, the following passage in\r\n     that letter will bear that construction:\r\n\r\n     \"What the Insurgent party seemed chiefly to favor was a\r\n     postponement of the question of separation, upon which the War is\r\n     waged, and a mutual direction of efforts of the Government, as well\r\n     as those of the Insurgents, to some extrinsic policy or scheme for\r\n     a season, during which passions might be expected to subside, and\r\n     the Armies be reduced, and trade and intercourse between the People\r\n     of both Sections resumed.  It was suggested by them that through\r\n     such postponements we might now have immediate Peace, with some not\r\n     very certain prospect of an ultimate satisfactory adjustment of\r\n     political relations between this Government, and the States,\r\n     Section, or People, now engaged in conflict with it.\"\r\n\r\n     For the whole of this letter see McPherson's History of the\r\n     Rebellion, p.  570.]\r\n\r\nFort Fisher, North Carolina, had already been captured by a combined\r\nMilitary and Naval attack of the Union forces under General Terry and\r\nAdmiral Porter; and Sherman's Army was now victoriously advancing from\r\nSavannah, Georgia, Northwardly through South Carolina.  On the 17th of\r\nFebruary, Columbia, the capital of the latter State, surrendered, and,\r\nthe day following, Charleston was evacuated, and its defenses, including\r\nhistoric Fort Sumter, were once more under that glorious old flag of the\r\nUnion which four years before had been driven away, by shot and shell\r\nand flame, amid the frantic exultations of the temporarily successful\r\narmed Conspirators of South Carolina.  On the 22nd of February, General\r\nSchofield, who had been sent by Grant with his 23rd Corps, by water, to\r\nform a junction with Terry's troops about Fort Fisher, and capture\r\nWilmington, North Carolina, had also accomplished his purpose\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel Cause now began to look pretty desperate, even to Rebel eyes.\r\n\r\n     [Hundreds of Rebels were now deserting from Lee's Armies about\r\n     Richmond, every night, owing partly to despondency.  \"These\r\n     desertions,\" wrote Lee, on the 24th February, \"have a very bad\r\n     effect upon the troops who remain, and give rise to painful\r\n     apprehensions.\"  Another cause was the lack of food and clothing.\r\n     Says Badeau (Military History of Ulysses S. Grant, vol.  iii., p.\r\n     399): \"On the 8th of January, Lee wrote to the Rebel Government\r\n     that the entire Right Wing of his Army had been in line for three\r\n     days and nights, in the most inclement weather of the season.\r\n     'Under these circumstances,' he said, 'heightened by assaults and\r\n     fire of the Enemy, some of the men had been without meat for three\r\n     days, and all were suffering from reduced rations and scant\r\n     clothing.  Colonel Cole, chief commissary, reports that he has not\r\n     a pound of meat at his disposal.  If some change is not made, and\r\n     the commissary department reorganized, I apprehend dire results.\r\n     The physical strength of the men, if their courage survives, must\r\n     fail under this treatment.  Our Cavalry has to be dispersed for\r\n     want of forage.  Fitz Lee's and Lomax's Divisions are scattered\r\n     because supplies cannot be transported where their services are\r\n     required.  I had to bring Fitz Lee's Division sixty miles Sunday\r\n     night, to get them in position.  Taking these facts in connection\r\n     with the paucity of our numbers, you must not be surprised if\r\n     calamity befalls us.'\" Badeau's (Grant, vol.  iii., p. 401,)]\r\n\r\nToward the end of February, the Rebel General Longstreet having\r\nrequested an interview with General Ord \"to arrange for the exchange of\r\ncitizen prisoners, and prisoners of war, improperly captured,\" General\r\nGrant authorized General Ord to hold such interview t and \"to arrange\r\ndefinitely for such as were confined in his department, arrangements for\r\nall others to be submitted for approval.\"  In the course of that\r\ninterview \"a general conversation ensued on the subject of the War,\"\r\nwhen it would seem that Longstreet suggested the idea of a composition\r\nof the questions at issue, and Peace between the United States and the\r\nRebels, by means of a Military Convention.  It is quite probable that\r\nthis idea originated with Jefferson Davis, as a /dernier resort/; for\r\nLongstreet appears to have communicated directly with Davis concerning\r\nhis interview or \"interviews\" with Ord.  On the 28th of February, 1865\r\nthe Rebel Chief wrote to Lee, as follows:\r\n\r\n                         \"RICHMOND, VA., February 28.\r\n\r\n\"Gen. R. E. LEE, Commanding, etc.,\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: You will learn by the letter of General Longstreet the result\r\nof his second interview with General Ord.  The points as to whether\r\nyourself or General Grant should invite the other to a Conference is not\r\nworth discussing.  If you think the statements of General Ord render it\r\nprobably useful that the Conference suggested should be had, you will\r\nproceed as you may prefer, and are clothed with all the supplemental\r\nauthority you may need in the consideration of any proposition for a\r\nMilitary Convention, or the appointment of a Commissioner to enter into\r\nsuch an arrangement as will cause at least temporary suspension of\r\nhostilities.\r\n                         \"Very truly yours\r\n                                   \"JEFFERSON DAVIS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThereupon General Lee wrote, and sent to General Grant, the following\r\ncommunication:\r\n\r\n               \"HEADQUARTERS C. S. ARMIES, March 2, 1865.\r\n\"Lieut. Gen. U. S. GRANT,\r\n\"Commanding United States Armies:\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: Lieut.-Gen.

Sincerely desirous to leave\r\nnothing untried which may put an end to the calamities of War, I propose\r\nto meet you at such convenient time and place as you may designate, with\r\nthe hope that, upon an interchange of views, it may be found practicable\r\nto submit the subjects of controversy between the belligerents to a\r\nConvention of the kind mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"In such event, I am authorized to do whatever the result of the\r\nproposed interview may render necessary or advisable.  Should you accede\r\nto this proposition, I would suggest that, if agreeable to you, we meet\r\nat the place selected by Generals Ord and Longstreet, for the interview,\r\nat 11 A.M., on Monday next.\r\n\r\n               \"Very respectfully your obedient servant,\r\n                              \"R. E. LEE, General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of this letter, General Grant sent a telegraphic dispatch\r\nto Secretary Stanton, informing him of Lee's proposition.  It reached\r\nthe Secretary of War just before midnight of March 3rd.  He, and the\r\nother members of the Cabinet were with the President, in the latter's\r\nroom at the Capitol, whither they had gone on this, the last, night of\r\nthe last Session of the Thirty-Eighth Congress, the Cabinet to advise,\r\nand the President to act, upon bills submitted to him for approval.  The\r\nSecretary, after reading the dispatch, handed it to Mr. Lincoln.  The\r\nlatter read and thought over it briefly, and then himself  wrote the\r\nfollowing reply:\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON, March, 3, 1865, 12 P.M.\r\n\r\n\"LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT: The President directs me to say to you that\r\nhe wishes you to have no Conference with General Lee, unless it be for\r\nthe capitulation of General Lee's Army, or on some other minor and\r\npurely Military matter.  He instructs me to say to you that you are not\r\nto decide, discuss, or confer upon any political question.  Such\r\nquestions the President holds in his own hands, and will submit them to\r\nno Military Conferences or Conventions.  Meanwhile you are to press to\r\nthe utmost your Military advantages.\r\n                              \"EDWIN M. STANTON,\r\n                              \"Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant received this dispatch, on the day following, and at once\r\nwrote and sent to General Lee a communication in which, after referring\r\nto the subject of the exchange of prisoners, he said: \"In regard to\r\nmeeting you on the 6th inst., I would state that--I have no authority to\r\naccede to your proposition for a Conference on the subject proposed.\r\nSuch authority is vested in the President of the United States alone.\r\nGeneral Ord could only have meant that I would not refuse an interview\r\non any subject on which I have a right to act; which, of course, would\r\nbe such as are purely of a Military character, and on the subject of\r\nexchange, which has been entrusted to me.\"\r\n\r\nThus perished the last reasonable hope entertained by the Rebel\r\nChieftains to ward off the inevitable and mortal blow that was about to\r\nsmite their Cause.\r\n\r\nThe 4th of March, 1865, had come.  The Thirty-Eighth Congress was no\r\nmore.  Mr. Lincoln was about to be inaugurated, for a second term, as\r\nPresident of the United States.  The previous night had been vexed with\r\na stormy snow-fall.  The morning had also been stormy and rainy.  By\r\nmid-day, however, as if to mark the event auspiciously, the skies\r\ncleared and the sun shone gloriously upon the thousands and tens of\r\nthousands who had come to Washington, to witness the second Inauguration\r\nof him whom the people had now, long since, learned to affectionately\r\nterm \"Father Abraham\"--of him who had become the veritable Father of his\r\nPeople.  As the President left the White House, to join the grand\r\nprocession to the Capitol, a brilliant meteor shot athwart the heavens,\r\nabove his head.  At the time, the superstitious thought it an Omen of\r\ntriumph--of coming Peace--but in the sad after-days when armed Rebellion\r\nhad ceased and Peace had come, it was remembered, with a shudder, as a\r\nportent of ill.  When, at last, Mr. Lincoln stood, with bared head, upon\r\nthe platform at the eastern portico of the Capitol, where four years\r\nbefore, he had made his vows before the People, under such very\r\ndifferent circumstances and surroundings, the contrast between that time\r\nand this--and all the terrible and eventful history of the interim\r\n--could not fail to present itself to every mind of all those congregated,\r\nwhether upon the platform among the gorgeously costumed foreign\r\ndiplomats, the full-uniformed Military and Naval officers of the United\r\nStates, and the more soberly-clad statesmen and Civic and Judicial\r\nfunctionaries of the Land, or in the vast and indiscriminate mass of the\r\nenthusiastic people in front and on both sides of it.  As Chief Justice\r\nChase administered the oath, and Abraham Lincoln, in view of all the\r\npeople, reverently bowed his head and kissed the open Bible, at a\r\npassage in Isaiah (27th and 28th verses of the 5th Chapter) which it was\r\nthought \"admonished him to be on his guard, and not to relax at all, in\r\nhis efforts,\" the people, whose first cheers of welcome had been stayed\r\nby the President's uplifted hand, broke forth in a tumult of cheering,\r\nuntil again hushed by the clear, strong, even voice of the President, as\r\nhe delivered that second Inaugural Address, whose touching tenderness,\r\nreligious resignation, and Christian charity, were clad in these\r\nimperishable words:\r\n\r\n\"FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: At this second appearing to take the Oath of the\r\nPresidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than\r\nthere was at the first.  Then, a statement, somewhat in detail, of a\r\ncourse to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.  Now, at the expiration\r\nof four years, during which public declarations have been constantly\r\ncalled forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still\r\nabsorbs the attention and engrosses the energy of the Nation, little\r\nthat is new could be presented.  The progress of our Arms, upon which\r\nall else depends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and it\r\nis, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all.  With high\r\nhope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\r\n\r\n\"On the occasion corresponding to this, four years ago, all thoughts\r\nwere anxiously directed to an impending Civil War.  All dreaded it--all\r\nsought to avert it.  While the Inaugural Address was being delivered\r\nfrom this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without War,\r\nInsurgent agents were in the city, seeking to destroy it without War\r\n--seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide the effects, by negotiation.\r\nBoth parties deprecated War; but one of them would make War rather than\r\nlet the Nation survive; and the other would accept War rather than let\r\nit perish--and the War came.\r\n\r\n\"One-eighth of the whole population were colored Slaves, not distributed\r\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it.\r\nThese Slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew\r\nthat this interest was, somehow, the cause of the War.  To strengthen,\r\nperpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the\r\nInsurgents would rend the Union, even by War; while the Government\r\nclaimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement\r\nof it.  Neither Party expected for the War the magnitude or the duration\r\nwhich it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause of\r\nthe conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself\r\nshould cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less\r\nfundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray to the\r\nsame God; and each invokes His aid against the other.  It may seem\r\nstrange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in\r\nwringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us\r\njudge not, that we be not judged.  The prayers of both could not be\r\nanswered--that of neither has been answered fully.  The Almighty has His\r\nown purposes.  'Woe unto the World because of offences! for it must\r\nneeds be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence\r\ncometh.'  If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those\r\noffences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which,\r\nhaving continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and\r\nthat He gives to both North and South this terrible War, as the woe due\r\nto those by Whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any\r\ndeparture from those divine attributes which the believers in a living\r\nGod always ascribe to Him?  Fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray\r\n--that this mighty scourge of War may speedily pass away.  Yet, if God\r\nwills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two\r\nhundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until\r\nevery drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn\r\nwith the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must\r\nbe said, 'The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.'\r\n\r\n\"With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the\r\nright, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the\r\nwork we are in; to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for him who\r\nshall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan--to do\r\nall which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting Peace among\r\nourselves, and with all Nations.\"\r\n\r\nWith utterances so just and fair, so firm and hopeful, so penitent and\r\nhumble, so benignant and charitable, so mournfully tender and sweetly\r\nsolemn, so full of the fervor of true piety and the very pathos of\r\npatriotism, small wonder is it that among those numberless thousands\r\nwho, on this memorable occasion, gazed upon the tall, gaunt form of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, and heard his clear, sad voice, were some who almost\r\nimagined they saw the form and heard the voice of one of the great\r\nprophets and leaders of Israel; while others were more reminded of one\r\nof the Holy Apostles of the later Dispensation who preached the glorious\r\nGospel \"On Earth, Peace, good will toward Men,\" and received in the end\r\nthe crown of Christian martyrdom.  But not one soul of those present\r\n--unless his own felt such presentiment--dreamed for a moment that, all\r\ntoo soon, the light of those brave and kindly eyes was fated to go out\r\nin darkness, that sad voice to be hushed forever, that form to lie\r\nbleeding and dead, a martyred sacrifice indeed, upon the altar of his\r\nCountry!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n                   COLLAPSE OF THE ARMED CONSPIRACY.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Sherman's Armies were pressing along upward, toward Raleigh,\r\nfrom Columbia, marching through swamps and over quicksands and across\r\nswollen streams--cold, wet, hungry, tired--often up to their armpits in\r\nwater, yet keeping their powder dry, and silencing opposing batteries or\r\ndriving the Enemy, who doggedly retired before them, through the\r\ndrenching rains which poured down unceasingly for days, and even weeks,\r\nat a time.  On the 16th of March, 1865, a part of Sherman's Forces met\r\nthe Enemy, under General Joe Johnston, at Averysboro, N.  C., and forced\r\nhim to retire.  On the 19th and 20th of March, occurred the series of\r\nengagements, about Mill Creek and the Bentonville and Smithfield\r\ncross-roads, which culminated in the attack upon the Enemy, of the 21st\r\nof March, and his evacuation, that night, of his entire line of works,\r\nand retreat upon Smithfield.  This was known as the Battle of\r\nBentonville, and was the last battle fought between the rival Forces\r\nunder Sherman and Johnston.  The Armies of Sherman, now swollen by\r\nhaving formed a junction with the troops under Schofield and Terry,\r\nwhich had come from Newbern and Wilmington, went into camp at Goldsboro,\r\nNorth Carolina, to await the rebuilding of the railroads from those two\r\npoints on the coast, and the arrival of badly needed clothing,\r\nprovision, and other supplies, after which the march would be resumed to\r\nBurksville, Virginia.  By the 25th of March, the railroad from Newbern\r\nwas in running order, and General Sherman, leaving General Schofield in\r\ncommand of his eighty thousand troops, went to Newbern and Morehead\r\nCity, and thence by steamer to City Point, for a personal interview with\r\nGeneral Grant.  On the same day, Lee made a desperate but useless\r\nassault, with twenty thousand (of his seventy thousand) men upon Fort\r\nStedman--a portion of Grant's works in front of Petersburg.  On the\r\n27th, President Lincoln reached City Point, on the James River, in the\r\nsteamer \"Ocean Queen.\"  Sherman reached City Point the same day, and,\r\nafter meeting the General-in-Chief, Grant took him on board the \"Ocean\r\nQueen\" to see the President.  Together they explained to Mr. Lincoln the\r\nMilitary situation, during the \"hour or more\" they were with him.  Of\r\nthis interview with Mr. Lincoln, General Sherman afterwards wrote:\r\n\"General Grant and I explained to him that my next move from Goldsboro\r\nwould bring my Army, increased to eighty thousand men by Schofield's and\r\nTerry's reinforcements, in close communication with General Grant's\r\nArmy, then investing Lee in Richmond, and that unless Lee could effect\r\nhis escape, and make junction with Johnston in North Carolina, he would\r\nsoon be shut up in Richmond with no possibility of supplies, and would\r\nhave to surrender.  Mr. Lincoln was extremely interested in this view of\r\nthe case, and when we explained that Lee's only chance was to escape,\r\njoin Johnston, and, being then between me in North Carolina, and Grant\r\nin Virginia, could choose which to fight.  Mr. Lincoln seemed unusually\r\nimpressed with this; but General Grant explained that, at the very\r\nmoment of our conversation, General Sheridan was passing his Cavalry\r\nacross James River, from the North to the South; that he would, with\r\nthis Cavalry, so extend his left below Petersburg as to meet the South\r\nShore Road; and that if Lee should 'let go' his fortified lines, he\r\n(Grant) would follow him so close that he could not possibly fall on me\r\nalone in North Carolina.  I, in like manner, expressed the fullest\r\nconfidence that my Army in North Carolina was willing to cope with Lee\r\nand Johnston combined, till Grant could come up.  But we both agreed\r\nthat one more bloody battle was likely to occur before the close of the\r\nWar.  Mr. Lincoln * * * more than once exclaimed: 'Must more blood be\r\nshed?  Cannot this last bloody battle be avoided?'  We explained that we\r\nhad to presume that General Lee was a real general; that he must see\r\nthat Johnston alone was no barrier to my progress; and that if my Army\r\nof eighty thousand veterans should reach Burksville, he was lost in\r\nRichmond; and that we were forced to believe he would not await that\r\ninevitable conclusion, but make one more desperate effort.\"\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln's intense anxiety caused him to remain at City Point,\r\nfrom this time forth, almost until the end--receiving from General\r\nGrant, when absent, at the immediate front, frequent dispatches, which,\r\nas fast as received and read, he transmitted to the Secretary of War,\r\nat Washington.  Grant had already given general instructions to\r\nMajor-Generals Meade, Ord, and Sheridan, for the closing movements of his\r\nimmediate Forces, against Lee and his lines of supply and possible\r\nretreat.  He saw that the time had come for which he had so long waited,\r\nand he now felt \"like ending the matter.\"  On the morning of the 29th of\r\nMarch--preliminary dispositions having been executed--the movements\r\nbegan.  That night, Grant wrote to Sheridan, who was at Dinwiddie Court\r\nHouse, with his ten thousand Cavalry: \"Our line is now unbroken from the\r\nAppomattox to Dinwiddie.  * * *  I feel now like ending the matter, if\r\nit is possible to do so, before going back.  * * *  In the morning, push\r\naround the Enemy, if you can, and get on his right rear.  * * * We will\r\nall act together as one Army, until it is seen what can be done with the\r\nEnemy.\"  The rain fell all that night in torrents.  The face of the\r\ncountry, where forests, swamps, and quicksands alternated in presenting\r\napparently insuperable obstacles to immediate advance, was very\r\ndiscouraging next morning, but Sheridan's heart was gladdened by orders\r\nto seize Five Forks.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st, the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House occurred--the Enemy\r\nattacking Sheridan and Warren with a largely superior force.  During the\r\nnight, Sheridan was reinforced with the Fifth Corps, and other troops.\r\nOn April 1st, Sheridan fought, and won, the glorious Battle of Five\r\nForks, against this detached Rebel force, and, besides capturing 6,000\r\nprisoners and six pieces of artillery, dispersed the rest to the North\r\nand West, away from the balance of Lee's Army.  That night, after Grant\r\nreceived the news of this victory, he went into his tent, wrote a\r\ndispatch, sent it by an orderly, and returning to the fire outside his\r\ntent, calmly said: \"I have ordered an immediate assault along the\r\nlines.\"  This was afterward modified to an attack at three points, on\r\nthe Petersburg works, at 4 o'clock in the morning--a terrific\r\nbombardment, however, to be kept up all night.  Grant also sent more\r\nreinforcements to Sheridan.  On the morning of April 2nd, the assault\r\nwas made, and the Enemy's works were gallantly carried, while Sheridan\r\nwas coming up to the West of Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe Rebel Chieftain Lee, when his works were stormed and carried, is\r\nsaid to have exclaimed: \"It has happened as I thought; the lines have\r\nbeen stretched until they broke.\"  At 10.30 A. M. he telegraphed to\r\nJefferson Davis: \"My lines are broken in three places.  Richmond must be\r\nevacuated this evening.\"  This dispatch of Parke, Ord on Wright's left,\r\nHumphreys on Ord's left and Warren on Humphrey's left-Sheridan being to\r\nthe rear and left of Warren, reached Davis, while at church.  All\r\npresent felt, as he retired, that the end of the Rebellion had come.  At\r\n10.40 A. M. Lee reported further: \"I see no prospect of doing more than\r\nholding our position here till night.  I am not certain that I can do\r\nthat.  If I can, I shall withdraw tonight, North of the Appomattox, and\r\nif possible, it will be better to withdraw the whole line to-night from\r\nJames river.  * * *  Our only chance of concentrating our Forces is to\r\ndo so near Danville railroad, which I shall endeavor to do at once.\r\nI advise that all preparations be made for leaving Richmond to-night.\r\nI will advise you later, according to circumstances.  \"At 7 o'clock P. M.\r\nLee again communicated to the Rebel Secretary of War this information:\r\n\"It is absolutely necessary that we should abandon our position\r\nto-night, or run the risk of being cut off in the morning.  I have given\r\nall the orders to officers on both sides of the river, and have taken\r\nevery precaution that I can to make the movement successful.  It will be\r\na difficult operation, but I hope not impracticable.  Please give all\r\norders that you find necessary, in and about Richmond.  The troops will\r\nall be directed to Amelia Court House.\"  This was the last dispatch sent\r\nby Lee to the Rebel Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of April, Petersburg and Richmond were evacuated, and again\r\nunder the Union flag, while Grant's immediate Forces were pressing\r\nforward to cut off the retreat of Lee, upon Amelia Court House and\r\nDanville, in an effort to form a junction with Johnston.  On the 6th,\r\nthe important Battle of Sailor's Creek, Va., was fought and won by\r\nSheridan.  On the evening of the 7th, at the Farmville hotel, where Lee\r\nhad slept the night before, Grant, after sending dispatches to Sheridan\r\nat Prospect Station, Ord at Prince Edward's Court House, and Mead at\r\nRice Station, wrote the following letter to Lee:\r\n\r\n                         \"FARMVILLE, April 7th, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: The results of the last week must convince you of the\r\nhopelessness of further resistance, on the part of the Army of Northern\r\nVirginia, in this struggle.  I feel that it is so, and regard it as my\r\nduty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion of\r\nblood, by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate\r\nStates' army known as the Army of Northern Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT,\r\n\"Lieutenant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLee, however, in replying to this demand, and in subsequent\r\ncorrespondence, seemed to be unable to see \"the hopelessness of further\r\nresistance.\"  He thought \"the emergency had not yet come.\"  Hence, Grant\r\ndecided to so press and harass him, as to bring the emergency along\r\nquickly.  Accordingly, by the night of the 8th of April, Sheridan with\r\nhis Cavalry had completely headed Lee off, at Appomattox Court House.\r\nBy morning, Ord's forces had reached Sheridan, and were in line behind\r\nhim.  Two Corps of the Army of the Potomac, under Meade, were also, by\r\nthis time, close on the Enemy's rear.  And now the harassed Enemy,\r\nconscious that his rear was threatened, and seeing only Cavalry in his\r\nfront, through which to fight his way, advanced to the attack.  The\r\ndismounted Cavalry of Sheridan contested the advance, in order to give\r\nOrd and Griffin as much time as possible to form, then, mounting and\r\nmoving rapidly aside, they suddenly uncovered, to the charging Rebels,\r\nOrd's impenetrable barrier of Infantry, advancing upon them at a\r\ndouble-quick!  At the same time that this appalling sight staggered\r\nthem, and rolled them back in despair, they became aware that Sheridan's\r\nimpetuous Cavalry, now mounted, were hovering on their left flank,\r\nevidently about to charge!\r\n\r\nLee at once concluded that the emergency \"had now come,\" and sent, both\r\nto Sheridan and Meade, a flag of truce, asking that hostilities cease,\r\npending negotiations for a surrender--having also requested of Grant an\r\naudience with a view to such surrender.  That afternoon the two great\r\nrival Military Chieftains met by appointment in the plain little\r\nfarm-house of one McLean--Lee dressed in his best full-dress uniform and\r\nsword, Grant in a uniform soiled and dusty, and without any sword--and,\r\nafter a few preliminary words, as to the terms proposed by Grant, the\r\nlatter sat down to the table, and wrote the following:\r\n\r\n                         \"APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE,\r\n                         \"VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the\r\n8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of Northern\r\nVirginia on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the officers and\r\nmen to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an officer to be\r\ndesignated by me, the other to be retained by such officer or officers\r\nas you may designate.  The officers to give their individual paroles not\r\nto take up arms against the Government of the United States, until\r\nproperly exchanged; and each company or regimental commander to sign a\r\nlike parole for the men of their commands.  The arms, artillery, and\r\npublic property to be parked and stacked, and turned over to the\r\nofficers appointed by me to receive them.  This will not embrace the\r\nside-arms of the officers nor their private horses or baggage.  This\r\ndone, each officer and man will be allowed to return to his home, not to\r\nbe disturbed by United States authority so long as they observe their\r\nparoles and the laws in force where they may reside.\r\n\r\n                                   \"U. S. GRANT,\r\n                              \"Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\"General R. E. LEE.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some further conversation, in which Grant intimated that his\r\nofficers receiving paroles would be instructed to \"allow the Cavalry and\r\nArtillery men to retain their horses, and take them home to work their\r\nlittle farms\"--a kindness which Lee said, would \"have the best possible\r\neffect,\" the latter wrote his surrender in the following words:\r\n\r\n               \"HEAD-QUARTERS, ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,\r\n                              April 9, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: I received your letter of this date containing the terms of\r\nthe surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, as proposed by you.  As\r\nthey are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the\r\n8th instant, they are accepted.  I will proceed to designate the proper\r\nofficers to carry the stipulations into effect.\r\n                              \"R. E. LEE, General.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant-General U. S. GRANT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore parting, Lee told Grant that his men were starving; and Grant at\r\nonce ordered 25,000 rations to be issued to the surrendered Rebels--and\r\nthen the Rebel Chieftain, shaking hands with the Victor, rode away to\r\nhis conquered legions.  It was 4.30 P.M. when Grant, on his way to his\r\nown headquarters, now with Sheridan's command, dismounted from his\r\nhorse, and sitting on a stone by the roadside, wrote the following\r\ndispatch:\r\n\r\n                              \"Hon. E. M. STANTON,\r\n                         Secretary of War, Washington.\r\n\r\n\"General Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia this afternoon on\r\nterms proposed by myself.  The accompanying additional correspondence\r\nwill show the conditions fully.\r\n                    \"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on the 5th of April, Grant, who had kept Sherman, as well as\r\nSheridan, advised of his main movements, had also ordered the former to\r\npress Johnston's Army as he was pressing Lee, so as, between them, they\r\nmight \"push on, and finish the job.\"  In accordance with this order,\r\nSherman's Forces advanced toward Smithfield, and, Johnston having\r\nrapidly retreated before them, entered Raleigh, North Carolina, on the\r\n13th.  The 14th of April, brought the news of the surrender of Lee to\r\nGrant, and the same day a correspondence was opened between Sherman and\r\nJohnston, looking to the surrender of the latter's Army--terms for which\r\nwere actually agreed upon, subject, however, to approval of Sherman's\r\nsuperiors.  Those terms, however, being considered unsatisfactory, were\r\npromptly disapproved, and similar terms to those allowed to Lee's Army,\r\nwere substituted, and agreed to, the actual surrender taking place April\r\n26th, near Durham, North Carolina.  On the 21st, Macon, Georgia, with\r\n12,000 Rebel Militia, and sixty guns, was surrendered to Wilson's\r\nCavalry-command, by General Howell Cobb.  On the 4th of May, General\r\nRichard Taylor surrendered all the armed Rebel troops, East of the\r\nMississippi river; and on the 26th of May, General Kirby Smith\r\nsurrendered all of them, West of that river.\r\n\r\nOn that day, organized, armed Rebellion against the United States\r\nceased, and became a thing of the past.  It had been conquered, stamped\r\nout, and extinguished, while its civic head, Jefferson Davis, captured\r\nMay 11th, at Irwinsville, Georgia, while attempting to escape, was, with\r\nother leading Rebels, a prisoner in a Union fort.  Four years of armed\r\nRebellion had been enough for them.  They were absolutely sick of it.\r\nAnd the magnanimity of the terms given them by Grant, completed their\r\nsubjugation.  \"The wisdom of his course,\" says Badeau,  \"was proved by\r\nthe haste which the Rebels made to yield everything they had fought for.\r\nThey were ready not only to give up their arms, but literally to implore\r\nforgiveness of the Government.  They acquiesced in the abolition of\r\nSlavery.  They abandoned the heresy of Secession, and waited to learn\r\nwhat else their conquerors would dictate.  They dreamed not of political\r\npower.  They only asked to be let live quietly under the flag they had\r\noutraged, and attempt in some degree to rebuild their shattered\r\nfortunes.  The greatest General of the Rebellion asked for pardon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n                             ASSASSINATION!\r\n\r\nBut while some of the great Military events alluded to in the preceding\r\nChapter, had been transpiring at the theatre of War, something else had\r\nhappened at the National Capital, so momentous, so atrocious, so\r\nexecrable, that it was with difficulty the victorious soldiers of the\r\nUnion, when they first heard the news, could be restrained from turning\r\nupon the then remaining armed Rebels, and annihilating them in their\r\nrighteous fury.\r\n\r\nLet us go back, for a moment, to President Lincoln, whom we left on\r\nboard the Ocean Queen, at City Point, toward the end of March and the\r\nbeginning of April, receiving dispatches from Grant, who was\r\nvictoriously engaged at the front.  On the very day that Richmond fell\r\n--April 4th--President Lincoln, with his little son \"Tad,\" Admiral Porter,\r\nand others, visited the burning city, and held a reception in the\r\nparlors of the Mansion which had now, for so many years, been occupied\r\nby the Chief Conspirator, Jefferson Davis, and which had been\r\nprecipitately abandoned when the flight of that Arch-Rebel and his\r\n\"Cabinet\" commenced.  On the 6th, the President, accompanied by his\r\nwife, Vice-President Johnson, and others from Washington, again visited\r\nRichmond, and received distinguished Virginians, to whom he addressed\r\nwords of wisdom and patriotism.\r\n\r\n     [\"On this occasion,\" says Arnold, \"he was called upon by several\r\n     prominent citizens of Virginia, anxious to learn what the policy of\r\n     the Government towards them would be.  Without committing himself\r\n     to specific details, he satisfied them that his policy would be\r\n     magnanimous, forgiving, and generous.  He told these Virginians\r\n     they must learn loyalty and devotion to the Nation.  They need not\r\n     love Virginia less, but they must love the Republic more.\"]\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of April, he returned to Washington, and the same day--his\r\nlast Sunday on Earth--came the grand and glorious news of Lee's\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nOn the Wednesday evening following, he made a lengthy speech, at the\r\nWhite House, to the great crowd that had assembled about it, to\r\ncongratulate him, and the Nation, upon the downfall of Rebellion.  His\r\nfirst thought in that speech, was of gratitude to God.  His second, to\r\nput himself in the background, and to give all the credit of Union\r\nMilitary success, to those who, under God, had achieved it.  Said he:\r\n\"We meet this evening, not in sorrow, but in gladness of heart.  The\r\nevacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of the\r\nprincipal Insurgent Army, give hope of a righteous and speedy Peace,\r\nwhose joyous expression cannot be restrained.  In the midst of this,\r\nhowever, He from whom all blessings flow, must not be forgotten.  A Call\r\nfor a National Thanksgiving is being prepared, and will be duly\r\npromulgated.  Nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of\r\nrejoicing, be overlooked.  Their honors must not be parcelled out with\r\nothers.  I myself was near the front, and had the high pleasure of\r\ntransmitting much of the good news to you; but no part of the honor, for\r\nplan or execution, is mine.  To General Grant, his skilful officers and\r\nbrave men, all belongs.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was almost entirely devoted to the subject of reconstruction\r\nof the States lately in Rebellion, and to an argument in favor of the\r\nReconstruction policy, under which a new and loyal government had been\r\nformed for the State of Louisiana.  \"Some twelve thousand voters in the\r\nheretofore Slave State of Louisiana,\" said he, \"have sworn allegiance to\r\nthe Union, assumed to be the rightful political power of the State, held\r\nelections, organized a State government, adopted a Free State\r\nConstitution, giving the benefit of public schools equally to Black and\r\nWhite, and empowering the Legislature to confer the elective franchise\r\nupon the colored man.  Their Legislature has already voted to ratify the\r\nConstitutional Amendment recently passed by Congress, abolishing Slavery\r\nthroughout the Nation.  These twelve thousand persons are thus fully\r\ncommitted to the Union, and to perpetual Freedom in the State; committed\r\nto the very things, and nearly all the things, the Nation wants; and\r\nthey ask the Nation's recognition and its assistance to make good that\r\ncommittal.  Now, if we reject and spurn them, we do our utmost to\r\ndisorganize and disperse them.  We, in effect, say to the White men,\r\n'You are worthless, or worse; we will neither help you, nor be helped by\r\nyou.'  To the Blacks we say, 'This cup of Liberty which these, your old\r\nmasters, hold to your lips, we will dash from you and leave you to the\r\nchances of gathering the spilled and scattered contents in some vague\r\nand undefined when, where, and how.'  If this course, discouraging and\r\nparalyzing both White and Black, has any tendency to bring Louisiana\r\ninto proper practical relations with the Union, I have, so far, been\r\nunable to perceive it.  If, on the contrary, we recognize and sustain\r\nthe new government of Louisiana, the converse of all this is made true.\"\r\n\r\nWhile, however, Mr. Lincoln thus upheld and defended this Louisiana plan\r\nof reconstruction, yet he conceded that in applying it to other States,\r\nwith their varying conditions, \"no exclusive and inflexible plan can\r\nsafely be prescribed as to details and collaterals.\"  The entire speech\r\nshows the greatest solicitude to make no mistake necessitating backward\r\nsteps, and consequent delay in reconstructing the Rebel States into\r\nLoyal ones; and especially anxious was he, in this, his last public\r\nutterance, touching the outcome of his great life-work, Emancipation.\r\n\"If,\" said he, \"we reject Louisiana, we also reject one vote in favor of\r\nthe proposed Amendment to the National Constitution.  To meet this\r\nproposition it has been argued that no more than three-fourths of those\r\nStates which have not attempted Secession are necessary to validly\r\nratify the Amendment.  I do not commit myself against this further than\r\nto say that such a ratification would be questionable, and sure to be\r\npersistently questioned; whilst a ratification by three-fourths of all\r\nthe States would be unquestioned and unquestionable.\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, by the President's direction, a War Department Order was\r\ndrawn up and issued, putting an end to drafting and recruiting, and the\r\npurchase of Military supplies, and removing all restrictions which\r\nMilitary necessity had imposed upon the trade and commerce and\r\nintercourse of any one part of the Union with the other.  On Friday, the\r\n14th of April, there was a meeting of the Cabinet at noon, to receive a\r\nreport from General Grant, in person--he having just arrived from the\r\nscene of Lee's surrender.  Later, the President rode out with Mrs.\r\nLincoln, and talked of the hard time they had had since coming to\r\nWashington; \"but,\" continued he, \"the War is over, and, with God's\r\nblessing, we may hope for four years of Peace and happiness, and then we\r\nwill go back to Illinois, and pass the rest of our lives in quiet.\"  At\r\nFord's Theatre, that evening, was played \"The American Cousin,\" and it\r\nhad been announced that both the President and General Grant would be\r\npresent.  Grant, however, was prevented from attending.  President\r\nLincoln attended with reluctance--possibly because of a presentiment\r\nwhich he had that day had, that \"something serious is going to happen,\"\r\nof which he made mention at the Cabinet meeting aforesaid.\r\n\r\nIt was about 9 o-clock P.M., that the President, with Mrs. Lincoln,\r\nMajor Rathbone, and Miss Harris, entered the Theatre, and, after\r\nacknowledging with a bow the patriotic acclamations with which the\r\naudience saluted him, entered the door of the private box, reserved for\r\nhis party, which was draped with the folds of the American flag.  At\r\nhalf past 10 o'clock, while all were absorbed in the play, a pistol-shot\r\nwas heard, and a man, brandishing a bloody dagger, was seen to leap to\r\nthe stage from the President's box, crying \"Sic Semper Tyrannis!\" His\r\nspurred boot, catching in the bunting, tripped him, so that he half fell\r\nand injured one leg, but instantly recovered himself, and, shouting \"The\r\nSouth is avenged!\" rushed across the stage, and disappeared.  It was an\r\nactor, John Wilkes Booth by name, who--inspired with all the mad,\r\nunreasoning, malignant hatred of everything representing Freedom and\r\nUnion, which was purposely instilled into the minds and hearts of their\r\nfollowers and sympathizers by the Rebel leaders and their chief\r\naccomplices in the North--had basely skulked into the box, behind Mr.\r\nLincoln, mortally wounded him with a pistol-bullet, and escaped--after\r\nstabbing Major Rathbone for vainly striving to arrest the vile\r\nassassin's flight.\r\n\r\nThus this great and good Ruler of our reunited People was foully\r\nstricken down in the very moment of his triumph; when the Union troops\r\nwere everywhere victorious; when Lee had surrendered the chief Army of\r\nthe downfallen Confederacy; when Johnston was on the point of\r\nsurrendering the only remaining Rebel force which could be termed an\r\nArmy; on the self-same day too, which saw the identical flag of the\r\nUnion, that four years before had been sadly hauled down from the\r\nflagstaff of Fort Sumter, triumphantly raised again over that historic\r\nfort; when, the War being at an end, everything in the future looked\r\nhopeful; at the very time when his merciful and kindly mind was\r\ndoubtless far away from the mimic scenes upon which he looked, revolving\r\nbeneficent plans for reconstructing and rebuilding the waste and\r\ndesolate places in the South which War had made; at this time, of all\r\ntimes, when his clear and just perceptions and firm patriotism were most\r\nneeded,\r\n\r\n     [For his last public words, two nights before, had been: \"In the\r\n     present 'situation,' as the phrase goes, it may be my duty to make\r\n     some new announcement to the people of the South.  I am\r\n     CONSIDERING, and shall not fail to act when satisfied that action\r\n     will be proper.\"]\r\n\r\nalike by conquerors and conquered, to guide and aid the Nation in the\r\ndifficult task of reconstruction, and of the new departure, looming up\r\nbefore it, with newer and broader and better political issues upon which\r\nall Patriot might safely divide, while all the old issues of\r\nStates-rights, Secession, Free-Trade, and Slavery, and all the mental\r\nand moral leprosy growing out of them, should lie buried far out of\r\nsight as dead-and-gone relics of the cruel and devastating War which\r\nthey alone had brought on!  Abraham Lincoln never spoke again.  The\r\nearly beams of the tomorrow's sun touched, but failed to warm, the\r\nlifeless remain of the great War-President and Liberator, as they were\r\nborne, in mournful silence, back to the White House, mute and ghastly\r\nwitness of the sheer desperation of those who, although armed Rebellion,\r\nin the open field, by the fair and legitimate modes of Military warfare,\r\nhad ceased, were determined still to keep up that cowardly \"fire in the\r\nrear\" which had been promised to the Rebel leaders by their Northern\r\nhenchmen and sympathizers.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of President Lincoln was but a part of the plot of\r\nBooth and his murderous Rebel-sympathizing fellow conspirators.  It was\r\ntheir purpose also to kill Grant, and Seward, and other prominent\r\nmembers of the Cabinet, simultaneously, in the wild hope that anarchy\r\nmight follow, and Treason find its opportunity.  In this they almost\r\nmiraculously failed, although Seward was badly wounded by one of the\r\nassassins.\r\n\r\nThat the Rebel authorities were cognizant of, and encouraged, this\r\ndastardly plot, cannot be distinctly proven.  But, while they naturally\r\nwould be likely, especially in the face of the storm of public\r\nexasperation which it raised throughout the Union, to disavow all\r\nknowledge of, or complicity in, the vengeful murder of President\r\nLincoln, and to destroy all evidences possible of any such guilty\r\nknowledge or complicity, yet there will ever be a strong suspicion that\r\nthey were not innocent.  From the time when it was first known that Mr.\r\nLincoln had been elected President, the air was full of threats that he\r\nshould not live to be inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThat the assassination, consummated in April, 1865, would\r\nhave taken place in February of 1861, had it not been for the timely\r\nefforts of Lieutenant-General Scott, Brigadier-General Stone, Hon.\r\nWilliam H. Seward, Frederick W. Seward, Esq., and David S. Bookstaver of\r\nthe Metropolitan Police of New York--is abundantly shown by\r\nSuperintendent John A.  Kennedy, in a letter of August 13, 1866, to be\r\nfound in vol. ii., of Lossing's \"Civil War in America,\" pages 147-149,\r\ncontaining also an extract from a letter of General Stone, in which the\r\nlatter--after mentioning that General Scott and himself considered it\r\n\"almost a certainty that Mr. Lincoln could not pass Baltimore alive by\r\nthe train on the day fixed\"--proceeds to say: \"I recommended that Mr.\r\nLincoln should be officially warned; and suggested that it would be\r\naltogether best that he should take the train of that evening from\r\nPhiladelphia, and so reach Washington early the next day.\"  * * *\r\nGeneral Scott, after asking me how the details could be arranged in so\r\nshort a time, and receiving my suggestion that Mr. Lincoln should be\r\nadvised quietly to take the evening train, and that it would do him no\r\nharm to have the telegraph wires cut for a few hours, he directed me to\r\nseek Mr. W. H. Seward, to whom he wrote a few lines, which he handed to\r\nme.  It was already ten o'clock, and when I reached Mr. Seward's house\r\nhe had left; I followed him to the Capitol, but did not succeed in\r\nfinding him until after 12 M. I handed him the General's note; he\r\nlistened attentively to what I said, and asked me to write down my\r\ninformation and suggestions, and then, taking the paper I had written,\r\nhe hastily left.  The note I wrote was what Mr. Frederick Seward carried\r\nto Mr. Lincoln in Philadelphia.  Mr. Lincoln has stated that it was this\r\nnote which induced him to change his journey as he did.  The stories of\r\ndisguise are all nonsense; Mr. Lincoln merely took the sleeping-car in\r\nthe night train.\r\n\r\nEqually certain also, is it, that the Rebel authorities were utterly\r\nindifferent to the means that might be availed of to secure success to\r\nRebellion.  Riots and arson, were among the mildest methods proposed to\r\nbe used in the Northern cities, to make the War for the Union a\r\n\"failure\"--as their Northern Democratic allies termed it--while,\r\namong other more devilish projects, was that of introducing cholera\r\nand yellow fever into the North, by importing infected rags!  Another\r\nmuch-talked-of scheme throughout the War, was that of kidnapping\r\nPresident Lincoln, and other high officials of the Union Government.\r\nThere is also evidence, that the Rebel chiefs not only received, but\r\nconsidered, the plans of desperadoes and cut-throats looking to the\r\nsuccess of the Rebellion by means of assassination.  Thus, in a footnote\r\nto page 448, vol. ii., of his \"Civil War in America,\" Lossing does not\r\nhesitate to characterize Jefferson Davis as \"the crafty and malignant\r\nChief Conspirator, who seems to have been ready at all times to\r\nentertain propositions to assassinate, by the hand of secret murder, the\r\nofficers of the Government at Washington;\" and, after fortifying that\r\nstatement by a reference to page 523 of the first volume of his work,\r\nproceeds to say: \"About the time (July, 1862) we are now considering, a\r\nGeorgian, named Burnham, wrote to Jefferson Davis, proposing to organize\r\na corps of five hundred assassins, to be distributed over the North, and\r\nsworn to murder President Lincoln, members of his Cabinet, and leading\r\nRepublican Senators, and other supporters of the Government.  This\r\nproposition was made in writing, and was regularly filed in the\r\n'Confederate War Department,' indorsed 'Respectfully referred to the\r\nSecretary of War, by order of the President,' and signed 'J. C  Ives.'\r\nOther communications of similar tenor, 'respectfully referred' by\r\nJefferson Davis, were placed on file in that 'War Department.'\"  All the\r\ndenials, therefore, of the Rebel chieftains, as to their complicity in\r\nthe various attempts to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, ending with his\r\ndastardly murder in April, 1865, will not clear their skirts of the\r\nodium of that unparalleled infamy.  It will cling to them, living or\r\ndead, until that great Day of Judgment when the exact truth shall be\r\nmade known, and \"their sin shall find them out.\"\r\n\r\n     [The New York Tribune, August 16, 1885, under the heading \"A NARROW\r\n     ESCAPE OF LINCOLN,\" quotes an interesting \"Omaha Letter, to the St.\r\n     Paul Pioneer Press,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"That more than one attempt was made to assassinate Abraham Lincoln\r\n     is a fact known to John W. Nichols, ex-president of the Omaha Fire\r\n     Department.  Mr. Nichols was one of the body-guard of President\r\n     Lincoln from the Summer of 1862 until 1865.  The following\r\n     narrative, related to your correspondent by Mr. Nichols, is\r\n     strictly true, and the incident is not generally known:\r\n\r\n     'One night about the middle of August, 1864, I was doing sentinel\r\n     duty at the large gate through which entrance was had to the\r\n     grounds of the Soldiers' Home.  The grounds are situated about a\r\n     quarter of a mile off the Bladensburg road, and are reached by\r\n     devious driveways.  About 11 o'clock I heard a rifle shot in the\r\n     direction of the city, and shortly afterwards I heard approaching\r\n     hoof-beats.  In two or three minutes a horse came dashing-up, and I\r\n     recognized the belated President.  The horse was very spirited, and\r\n     belonged to Mr. Lamon, marshal of the District of Columbia.  This\r\n     horse was Mr. Lincoln's favorite, and when he was in the White\r\n     House stables he always chose him.  As horse and rider approached\r\n     the gate, I noticed that the President was bareheaded.  After\r\n     assisting him in checking his steed, the President said to me: 'He\r\n     came pretty near getting away with me, didn't he?  He got the bit\r\n     in his teeth before I could draw the rein.'  I then asked him where\r\n     his hat was, and he replied that somebody had fired a gun off down\r\n     at the foot of the hill, and that his horse had become scared and\r\n     jerked his hat off.  I led the animal to the Executive Cottage, and\r\n     the President dismounted and entered.  Thinking the affair rather\r\n     strange, a corporal and myself started in the direction of the\r\n     place from where the sound of the rifle report had proceeded, to\r\n     investigate the occurrence.  When we reached the spot where the\r\n     driveway intersects with the main road we found the President's\r\n     hat--a plain silk hat-and upon examining it we discovered a bullet\r\n     hole through the crown.  The shot had been fired upwards, and it\r\n     was evident that the person who fired the shot had secreted himself\r\n     close to the roadside.  We listened and searched the locality\r\n     thoroughly, but to no avail.  The next day I gave Mr. Lincoln his\r\n     hat and called his attention to the bullet hole.  He rather\r\n     unconcernedly remarked that it was put there by some foolish\r\n     gunner, and was not intended for him.  He said, however, that he\r\n     wanted the matter kept quiet, and admonished us to say nothing\r\n     about it.  We all felt confident that it was an attempt to kill\r\n     him, and a well-nigh successful one, too.  The affair was kept\r\n     quiet, in accordance with his request.  After that, the President\r\n     never rode alone.'\"]\r\n\r\nThat this dark and wicked and bloody Rebellion, waged by the upholders\r\nand advocates of Slavery, Free Trade, and Secession, had descended so\r\nlow as to culminate in murder--deliberate, cold-blooded, cowardly\r\nmurder--at a time when the Southern Conspirators would apparently be the\r\nleast benefitted by it, was regarded at first as evidencing their mad\r\nfatuity; and the public mind was dreadfully incensed.\r\n\r\nThe successor of the murdered President-Andrew Johnson-lost little time\r\nin offering (May the 2d) rewards, ranging from $25,000 to $100,000, for\r\nthe arrest of Jefferson Davis, Jacob Thompson,\r\n\r\n     [The same individual at whose death, in 1885, the Secretary of the\r\n     Interior, ordered the National flag of the Union--which he had\r\n     swindled, betrayed, fought, spit upon, and conspired against--to be\r\n     lowered at halfmast over the Interior Departmental Building, at\r\n     Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\nClement C. Clay, Beverly Tucker, George N.  Sanders, and W. C. Cleary,\r\nin a Proclamation which directly charged that they, \"and other Rebels\r\nand Traitors against the Government of the United States, harbored in\r\nCanada,\" had \"incited, concerted, and procured\" the perpetration of the\r\nappalling crime.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of May, one of them, Jacob Thompson, from his place of\r\nsecurity, in Canada, published a letter claiming to be innocent;\r\ncharacterized himself as \"a persecuted man;\" arrayed certain suspicious\r\nfacts in support of an intimation that Johnson himself was the only one\r\nman in the Republic who would be benefited by President Lincoln's death;\r\nand, as he was found \"asleep\" at the \"unusual hour\" of nine o'clock\r\nP.M., of the 14th of April, and had made haste to take the oath of\r\noffice as President of the United States as soon as the breath had left\r\nthe body of his predecessor, insinuated that he (Johnson) might with\r\nmore reason be suspected of \"complicity\" in \"the foul work\" than the\r\n\"Rebels and Traitors\" charged with it, in his Proclamation; so charged,\r\nfor the very purpose--Thompson insinuated--of shielding himself from\r\ndiscovery, and conviction!\r\n\r\nBut while, for a moment, perhaps, there flitted across the public mind a\r\nhalf suspicion of the possibility of what this Rebel intimated as true,\r\nyet another moment saw it dissipated.  For the People remembered that\r\nbetween \"Andrew Johnson,\" one of the \"poor white trash\" of Tennessee,\r\nand the \"aristocratic Slave-owners\" of the South, who headed the\r\nRebellion, there could be neither sympathy nor cooperation--nothing, but\r\nhatred; and that this same Andrew Johnson, who, by power of an\r\nindomitable will, self-education, and natural ability, had, despite the\r\nefforts of that \"aristocracy,\" forced himself upward, step by step, from\r\nthe tailor's bench, to the successful honors of alderman and Mayor, and\r\nthen still upward through both branches of his State Legislature, into\r\nthe House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States--and,\r\nin the latter Body, had so gallantly met, and worsted in debate, the\r\nchosen representatives of that class upon whose treasonable heads he\r\npoured forth in invective, the gathered hatred of a life-time--would\r\nprobably be the very last man whom these same \"aristocratic\"\r\nConspirators, \"Rebels, and Traitors,\" would prefer as arbiter of their\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThe popular feeling responded heartily, at this time, to the\r\ndenunciations which, in his righteous indignation, he had, in the\r\nSenate, and since, heaped upon Rebellion, and especially his declaration\r\nthat \"Treason must be made odious!\"--utterances now substantially\r\nreiterated by him more vehemently than ever, and multiplied in posters\r\nand transparencies and newspapers all over the Land.  Thus the public\r\nmind rapidly grew to believe it impossible that the Rebel leaders could\r\ngain, by the substitution, in the Executive chair, of this harsh,\r\ndetermined, despotic nature, for the mild, kindly, merciful,\r\neven-tempered, Abraham Lincoln.  With Andrew Johnson for President, the\r\nPeople felt that justice would fall upon the heads of the guilty, and\r\nthat the Country was safe.  And so it happened that, while the mere\r\ninstruments of the assassination conspiracy were hurried to an\r\nignominious death, in the lull that followed, Jefferson Davis and others\r\nof the Rebel chiefs, who had been captured and imprisoned, were allowed\r\nto go \"Scott-free, without even the semblance of a trial for their\r\nTreason!\"\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this work to deal with the history of the\r\nReconstruction or rehabilitation of the Rebel States; to look too\r\nclosely into the devious ways and subtle methods through and by which\r\nthe Rebel leaders succeeded in flattering the vanity, and worming\r\nthemselves into the confidence and control, of Andrew Johnson--by\r\npretending to believe that his occupation of the Presidential Office had\r\nnow, at last, brought him to their \"aristocratic\" altitude, and to a\r\nhearty recognition by them of his \"social equality;\" or to follow,\r\neither in or out of Congress, the great political conflict, between\r\ntheir unsuspecting Presidential dupe and the Congress, which led to the\r\nimpeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, for high crimes and\r\nmisdemeanors in office, his narrow escape from conviction and\r\ndeposition, and to much consequent excitement and turmoil among the\r\nPeople, which, but for wise counsels and prudent forethought of the\r\nRepublican leaders, in both Civil and Military life, might have\r\neventuated in the outbreak of serious civil commotions.  Suffice it to\r\nsay, that in due time; long after the Thirteenth Amendment to the United\r\nStates Constitution had been ratified by three-fourths of all the\r\nStates; after Johnson had vexed the White House, with his noisy\r\npresence, for the nearly four years succeeding the death of the great\r\nand good Lincoln; and after the People, with almost unexampled\r\nunanimity, had called their great Military hero, Grant, to the helm of\r\nState; the difficult and perplexing problems involved in the\r\nReconstruction of the Union were, at last, successfully solved by the\r\nRepublican Party, and every State that had been in armed Rebellion\r\nagainst that Union, was not only back again, with a Loyal State\r\nConstitution, but was represented in both branches of Congress, and in\r\nother Departments of the National Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n                        TURNING BACK THE HANDS!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, the War having ended in the defeat, conquest, and capture, of\r\nthose who, inspired by the false teachings of Southern leaders, had\r\narrayed themselves in arms beneath the standard of Rebellion, and fought\r\nfor Sectional Independence against National Union, for Slavery against\r\nFreedom, and for Free Trade against a benignant Tariff protective alike\r\nto manufacturer, mechanic, and laborer, it might naturally be supposed\r\nthat, with the collapse of this Rebellion, all the issues which made up\r\n\"the Cause\"--the \"Lost Cause,\" as those leaders well termed it--would be\r\nlost with it, and disappear from political sight; that we would never\r\nagain hear of a Section of the Nation, and last of all the Southern\r\nSection, organized, banded together, solidified in the line of its own\r\nSectional ideas as against the National ideas prevailing elsewhere\r\nthrough the Union; that Free Trade, conscious of the ruin and desolation\r\nwhich it had often wrought, and of the awful sacrifices, in blood and\r\ntreasure, that had been made in its behalf by the conquered South, would\r\nslink from sight and hide its famine-breeding front forever; and that\r\nSlavery, in all its various disguises, was banished, never more to\r\nobtrude its hateful form upon our Liberty-loving Land.  That was indeed\r\nthe supposition and belief which everywhere pervaded the Nation, when\r\nRebellion was conquered by the legions of the Union--and which\r\nespecially pervaded the South.  Never were Rebels more thoroughly\r\nexhausted and sick of Rebellion and of everything that led to it, than\r\nthese.  As Badeau said, they made haste \"to yield everything they had\r\nfought for,\" and \"dreamed not of political power.\"  They had been\r\nbrought to their knees, suing for forgiveness, and thankful that their\r\nforfeit lives were spared.\r\n\r\nFor awhile, with chastened spirit, the reconstructed South seemed to\r\nreconcile itself in good faith to the legitimate results of the War, and\r\nall went well.  But Time and Peace soon obliterate the lessons and the\r\nmemories of War.  And it was not very long after the Rebellion had\r\nceased, and the old issues upon which it was fought had disappeared from\r\nthe arena of National politics, when its old leaders and their\r\nsuccessors began slowly, carefully, and systematically, to relay the\r\ntumbled-down, ruined foundations and walls of the Lost Cause--a work in\r\nwhich, unfortunately, they were too well aided by the mistaken clemency\r\nand magnanimity of the Republican Party, in hastily removing the\r\npolitical disabilities of those leaders.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding farther, it is necessary to remark here, that, after\r\nthe suppression of the Rebellion and adoption of the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States, which prohibits\r\nSlavery and Involuntary Servitude within the United States, it soon\r\nbecame apparent that it was necessary to the protection of the Freedmen,\r\nin the civil and political rights and privileges which it was considered\r\ndesirable to secure to them, as well as to the creation and fostering of\r\na wholesome loyal sentiment in, and real reconstruction of, the States\r\nthen lately insurgent, and for certain other reasons, that other\r\nsafeguards, in the shape of further Amendments to the Constitution,\r\nshould be adopted.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments were, on the 16th of\r\nJune, 1866, and 27th of February, 1869, respectively, proposed by\r\nCongress to the Legislatures of the several States, and were declared\r\nduly ratified, and a part of the Constitution, respectively on the 28th\r\nof July, 1868, and March 30, 1870.  Those Amendments were in these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \"ARTICLE XIV.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 1.--All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and\r\nsubject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States\r\nand of the State wherein they reside.  No State shall make or enforce\r\nany law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of\r\nthe United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,\r\nliberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person\r\nwithin its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 2.--Representatives shall be apportioned among the several\r\nStates according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number\r\nof persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.  But when the\r\nright to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President\r\nand Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress,\r\nthe Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the\r\nLegislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such\r\nState, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States,\r\nor in any way abridged, except for participation in Rebellion, or other\r\ncrime, the basis of Representation therein shall be reduced in the\r\nproportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the\r\nwhole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 3.--No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress,\r\nor Elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or\r\nmilitary, under the United States, or under any State, who, having\r\npreviously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of\r\nthe United States, or as a member of any State Legislature, or as an\r\nexecutive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution\r\nof the United States, shall have engaged in Insurrection or Rebellion\r\nagainst the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.  But\r\nCongress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such\r\ndisability.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 4.--The validity of the public debt of the United States,\r\nauthorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and\r\nbounties for services in suppressing Insurrection or Rebellion, shall\r\nnot be questioned.  But neither the United States nor any State shall\r\nassume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of Insurrection or\r\nRebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or\r\nEmancipation of any Slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims\r\nshall be held illegal and void.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 5.--The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate\r\nlegislation, the provisions of this article.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \"ARTICLE XV.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 1.--The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall\r\nnot be denied or abridged by, the United States or by any State on\r\naccount of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\n\"SECTION 2.--The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by\r\nappropriate legislation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, from the provisions of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth,\r\nand Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution, and the Congressional\r\nlegislation subsequently enacted for the purpose of enforcing them, that\r\nnot only the absolute personal Freedom of every man, woman, and child in\r\nthe United States was thus irrevocably decreed; that United States\r\ncitizenship was clearly defined; that the life, liberty, property,\r\nprivileges and immunities of all were secured by throwing around them\r\nthe \"equal protection of the laws;\" that the right of the United States\r\ncitizen to vote, was placed beyond denial or abridgment, on \"account of\r\nrace, color, or previous condition of servitude;\" but, to make this more\r\ncertain, the basis of Congressional Representative-apportionment was\r\nchanged from its former mixed relation, comprehending both persons and\r\n\"property,\" so-called, to one of personal numbers--the Black man now\r\ncounting quite as much as the White man, instead of only three-fifths as\r\nmuch; and it was decreed, that, except for crime, any denial to United\r\nStates citizens, whether Black or White, of the right to vote at any\r\nelection of Presidential electors, Congressional Representatives, State\r\nGovernors, Judges, or Legislative members, \"shall\" work a reduction,\r\nproportioned to the extent of such denial, in the Congressional\r\nRepresentation of the State, or States, guilty of it.  As a further\r\nsafeguard, in the process of reconstruction, none of the insurgent\r\nStates were rehabilitated in the Union except upon acceptance of those\r\nthree Amendments as an integral part of the United States Constitution,\r\nto be binding upon it; and it was this Constitution as it is, and not\r\nthe Constitution as it was, that all the Representatives, in both Houses\r\nof Congress, from those insurgent States--as well as all their State\r\nofficers--swore to obey as the supreme law of the Land, when taking\r\ntheir respective oaths of office.\r\n\r\nBiding their time, and pretending to act in good faith, as the\r\nyears rolled by, the distrust and suspicion with which the old\r\nRebel-conspirators had naturally been regarded, gradually lessened in\r\nthe public mind.  With a glad heart, the Congress, year after year,\r\nremoved the political disabilities from class after class of those who\r\nhad incurred them, until at last all, so desiring, had been reinstated\r\nin the full privileges of citizenship, save the very few unrepentant\r\ninstigators and leaders of the Rebellion, who, in the depths of that\r\noblivion to which they seemingly had been consigned, continued to nurse\r\nthe bitterness of their downfall into an implacable hatred of that\r\nRepublic which had paralyzed the bloody hands of Rebellion, and\r\nshattered all their ambitious dreams of Oligarchic rule, if not of\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nBut, while the chieftains of the great Conspiracy--and of the armed\r\nRebellion itself--remained at their homes unpunished, through the\r\nclemency of the American People; the active and malignant minds of some\r\nof them were plotting a future triumph for the \"Lost Cause,\" in the\r\noverthrow, in consecutive detail, of the Loyal governments of the\r\nSouthern States, by any and all means which might be by them considered\r\nmost desirable, judicious, expedient, and effectual; the solidifying of\r\nthese Southern States into a new Confederation, or league, in fact--with\r\nan unwritten but well understood Constitution of its own--to be known\r\nunder the apparently harmless title of the \"Solid South,\" whose mission\r\nit would be to build up, and strengthen, and populate, and enrich itself\r\nwithin the Union, for a time, greater or less, according to\r\ncircumstances, and in the meanwhile to work up, with untiring devotion\r\nand energy, not only to this practical autonomy and Sectional\r\nIndependence within the Union, but also to a practical re-enslavement of\r\nthe Blacks, and to the vigorous reassertion and triumph, by the aid of\r\nBritish gold, of those pernicious doctrines of Free-Trade which, while\r\nbeneficial to the Cotton-lords of the South, would again check and drag\r\ndown the robust expansion of manufactures and commerce in all other\r\nparts of the Land, and destroy the glorious prosperity of farmers,\r\nmechanics, and laborers, while at the same time crippling Capital, in\r\nthe North and West.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish these results--after whatever of suspicion and\r\ndistrust that might have still remained in Northern minds had been\r\nremoved by the public declaration in 1874, by one of the ablest and most\r\npersuasively eloquent of Southern statesmen, that \"The South--prostrate,\r\nexhausted, drained of her life-blood as well as of her material\r\nresources, yet still honorable and true--accepts the bitter award of the\r\nbloody arbitrament without reservation, resolutely determined to abide\r\nthe result with chivalrous fidelity\"--these old Rebel leaders commenced\r\nin good earnest to carry out their well organized programme, which they\r\nhad already experimentally tested, to their own satisfaction, in certain\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nThe plan was this: By the use of shot-guns and rifles, and cavalcades of\r\narmed white Democrats, in red shirts, riding around the country at dead\r\nof night, whipping prominent Republican Whites and Negroes to death, or\r\nshooting or hanging them if thought advisable, such terror would fall\r\nupon the colored Republican voters that they would keep away from the\r\npolls, and consequently the white Democrats, undeterred by such\r\ninfluences, and on the contrary, eager to take advantage of them, would\r\npoll not only a full vote, but a majority vote, on all questions,\r\nwhether involving the mere election of Democratic officials, or\r\notherwise; and where intimidation of this, or any other kind, should\r\nfail, then a resort to be had to whatever devices might be found\r\nnecessary to make a fraudulent count and return, and thus secure\r\nDemocratic triumph; and furthermore, when evidences of these\r\nintimidations and frauds should be presented to those people of the\r\nUnion who believe in every citizen of this free Republic having one free\r\nvote, and that vote fairly counted, then to laugh the complainants out\r\nof Court with the cry that such stories are not true; are \"campaign\r\nlies\" devised solely for political effect; and are merely the product of\r\nRepublican \"outrage mills,\" ground out, to order.\r\n\r\nThis plan was first thoroughly tried in Mississippi, and has hence been\r\ncalled the \"Mississippi plan.\"  So magically effectual was it, that,\r\nwith variations adapted to locality and circumstances, this \"Mississippi\r\nplan\" soon enveloped the entire South in its mesh-work of fraud,\r\nbarbarity, and blood.  The massacres, and other outrages, while\r\nmethodical, were remittent, wave-like, sometimes in one Southern State,\r\nsometimes another, and occurring only in years of hot political\r\nconflict, until one after another of those States had, by these crimes,\r\nbeen again brought under the absolute control of the old Rebel leaders.\r\nBy 1876, they had almost succeeded in their entire programme.  They had\r\ncaptured all, save three, of the Southern States, and strained every\r\nnerve and every resource of unprincipled ingenuity, of bribery and\r\nperjury, after the Presidential election of that year had taken place,\r\nin the effort to defeat the will of the People and \"count in,\" the\r\nPresidential candidate of the Democratic Party.\r\n\r\n     [The shameful history of the \"Tilden barrel\" and the \"Cipher\r\n     Dispatches\" is too fresh in the public mind to be entirely\r\n     forgotten,]\r\n\r\nFailing in this effort, the very failure became a grievance.  On the\r\nprinciple of a fleeing thief diverting pursuit by shouting \"Stop thief,\"\r\nthe cry of \"fraud\" was raised by the Democratic leaders, North and\r\nSouth, against the Republican Party, and was iterated and reiterated so\r\nlong and loudly, that soon they actually began, themselves, to believe,\r\nthat President Hayes had been \"counted in,\" by improper methods!  At all\r\nevents, under cover of the hue and cry thus raised, the Southern leaders\r\nhurried up their work of Southern solidification, by multiplied outrages\r\non the \"Mississippi plan,\" so that, by 1880, they were ready to dictate,\r\nand did dictate, the Democratic Presidential nominations.\r\n\r\n     [Senator Wallace, of Pennsylvania, telegraphed from Cincinnati his\r\n     congratulations to General Hancock, and added: \"General Buell tells\r\n     me that Murat Halsted says Hancock's nomination by the Confederate\r\n     Brigadiers sets the old Rebel yell to the music of the Union.\"  In\r\n     the Convention which nominated Hancock, Wade Hampton made a speech,\r\n     saying; \"On behalf of the 'Solid South,' that South which once was\r\n     arrayed against the great soldier of Pennsylvania, I stand here to\r\n     pledge you its solid vote.  [cheers] * * * There is no name which\r\n     is held in higher respect among the people of the South, than that\r\n     of the man you have given to us as our standard-bearer.\"  And\r\n     afterward, in a speech at Staunton, Virginia, the same Southern\r\n     leader, in referring to the action of the Democratic Convention at\r\n     Cincinnati, said: \"There was but one feeling among the Southern\r\n     delegates.  That feeling was expressed when we said to our Northern\r\n     Democratic brethren 'Give us an available man.'  They gave us that\r\n     man.\"]\r\n\r\nWhile these old Rebel leaders of the South had insisted upon, and had\r\nsucceeded in, nominating a man whose record as a Union soldier would\r\nmake him popular in the North and West, and while their knowledge of his\r\navailability for Southern purposes would help them in their work of\r\nabsolutely solidifying the South, they took very good care also to press\r\nforward their pet Free-Trade issue--that principle so dear to the hearts\r\nof the Rebel Cotton-lords that, as has already been hinted, they\r\nincorporated it into their Constitution of Confederation in these words:\r\n\r\n\"SEC. 8.--Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties,\r\nimposts and excises for revenue necessary to pay the debts, provide for\r\nthe common defense, and carry on the Government of the Confederate\r\nStates; but no bounty shall be granted from the Treasury, nor shall any\r\nduty or tax on importation from Foreign Nations be laid to promote or\r\nfoster any branch of industry.\"\r\n\r\nIt may also be remarked that, under the inspiration of those Southern\r\nleaders who afterward rebelled, it had been laid down as Democratic\r\ndoctrine, in the National Democratic platform of 1856--and \"reaffirmed\"\r\nas such, in 1860--that \"The time has come for the People of the United\r\nStates to declare themselves in favor of * * * progressive Free-Trade.\r\n* * *  That justice and sound policy forbid the Federal Government to\r\nfoster one branch of industry to the detriment of another.\"  But, by\r\n1864, the Republican Protective-Tariff of 1860, had so abundantly\r\ndemonstrated, to all our people engaged in industrial occupations, the\r\nbeneficence of the great principle of home industrial Protection, that\r\nTariff-agitation actually ceased, and the National Democratic platform\r\nof that year had nothing to say in behalf of Free-Trade!\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the War, however, at the very first National\r\nDemocratic Convention, in 1868, at which there were delegations from the\r\nlately rebellious States, the question was at once brought to the front,\r\nand, under the inspiration of the old Rebel leaders aforesaid, the\r\nDemocratic platform again raised the banner of Free-Trade by declaring\r\nfor a Tariff for revenue.  But the mass of the People, at that time\r\nstill freshly remembered the terrible commercial disasters and\r\nindustrial depressions which had befallen the Land, through the\r\npractical operation of that baleful Democratic Free-Trade doctrine,\r\nbefore the Rebellion broke out, and sharply contrasted the misery and\r\npoverty and despair of those dark days of ruin and desolation, with the\r\ncomfort and prosperity and hopefulness which had since come to them\r\nthrough the Republican Protective-Tariff Accordingly, the Republican\r\nPresidential candidate, representing the great principle of Protection\r\nto American Industries, was elected over the Democratic Free-Trade\r\ncandidate, by 214 to 71 electoral votes-or nearly three to one!\r\n\r\nTaught, by this lesson, that the People were not yet sufficiently\r\nprepared for a successful appeal in behalf of anything like Free-Trade,\r\nthe next National Democratic Convention, (that of 1872), under the same\r\nSouthern inspiration, more cautiously declared, in its platform, that\r\n\"Recognizing that there are in our midst, honest but irreconcilable\r\ndifferences of opinion, with regard to the respective systems of\r\nProtection and Free-Trade, we remit the discussion of the subject to the\r\nPeople in their Congressional districts, and to the decision of the\r\nCongress thereon, wholly free from Executive interference or dictation.\"\r\nThe People, however, rebuked the moral cowardice thus exhibited by the\r\nDemocracy--in avoiding a direct issue on the doctrine which Democracy\r\nitself had galvanized at least into simulated life,--by giving 286\r\nelectoral votes to the Republican candidate, to 63 for the Democratic,\r\n--or in the proportion of nearly five to one.\r\n\r\nWarned, by this overwhelming defeat, not to flinch from, or avoid, or\r\ntry to convert the great National question of Tariff, into a merely\r\nlocal one, the National Democratic platform of 1876, at the instigation\r\nof the old Rebel leaders of the now fast solidifying South, came out\r\nflat-footedly again with the \"demand that all Custom-house taxation\r\nshall be only for revenue.\"  This time, the electoral vote stood almost\r\nevenly divided, viz.: for the Republican candidate, 185; for the\r\nDemocratic candidate, 184;--a result so extremely close, as to lead to\r\nthe attempted perpetration of great frauds against the successful\r\ncandidate; the necessary settlement of the questions growing out of\r\nthem, by an Electoral commission--created by Congress at the instance of\r\nthe Democratic Party; great irritation, among the defeated Democracy,\r\nover the just findings of that august Tribunal; and to the birth of the\r\nalleged Democratic \"grievance,\" aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThe closeness of this vote--their almost triumph, in 1876,--encouraged\r\nthe Solid South to press upon the National Democratic Convention of\r\n1880, the expediency of adopting a Free-Trade \"plank\" similar to that\r\nwith which, in 1876, they had so nearly succeeded.  Hence the Democratic\r\nplatform of 1880, also declared decidedly for \"A Tariff for revenue\r\nonly.\"\r\n\r\nThe old Rebel leaders, at last in full control of the entire Democratic\r\nParty, had now got things pretty much as they wanted them.  They had\r\ncreated that close corporation within the Union--that /imperium in\r\nimperio/ that oligarchically--governed league of States (within the\r\nRepublic of the United States) which they termed the \"Solid South,\" and\r\nwhich would vote as a unit, on all questions, as they directed; they had\r\ndictated the nomination, by the Democratic Party, of a Presidential\r\ncandidate who would not dare to act counter to their wishes; and their\r\npet doctrine of Free-Trade was held up, to the whole Democratic front,\r\nunder the attractive disguise of a Tariff for revenue only.\r\n\r\n     [As Ex-Senator Toombs, of Georgia, wrote: \"The old boys of the\r\n     South will see that 'Hancock' does the fair thing by them.  In\r\n     other words, he will run the machine to suit them, or they will run\r\n     the thing themselves.  They are not going to be played with any\r\n     longer.\"]\r\n\r\nIn other words, they had already secured a \"Solid South,\" an \"available\"\r\ncandidate, and an \"expedient\" Free-Trade platform.  All that remained\r\nfor them, at this stage, to do, was to elect the candidate, and enact\r\ntheir Free-Trade doctrine into legislation.  This was their current\r\nwork, so to speak--to be first attended to--but not all their work; for\r\none of the most brilliant and candid of their coadjutors had said, only\r\na few months before: \"We do not intend to stop until we have stricken\r\nthe last vestige of your War measures from the Statute-book.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, for their plans, an attempt made by them, under\r\nthe lead of Mr. Morrison of Illinois, in 1876, to meddle with the\r\nRepublican Protective-Tariff, had caused considerable public alarm, and\r\nhad been credited with having much to do with a succeeding monetary\r\npanic, and industrial depression.  Another and more determined effort,\r\nmade by them in 1878, under the lead of their old Copperhead ally,\r\nFernando Wood, to cut down the wise Protective duties imposed by the\r\nTariff Act, about 15 per cent.,--together with the cold-blooded\r\nFree-Trade declaration of Mr. Wood, touching his ruinous Bill, that \"Its\r\nreductions are trifling as compared with what they should be.  * * *  If\r\nI had the power to commence de novo, I should reduce the duties 50 per\r\ncent., instead of less than 15 per cent., upon an average\r\nas now proposed,\"--an effort which was narrowly, and with great\r\ndifficulty, defeated by the Republicans, aided by a mere handful of\r\nothers,--had also occasioned great excitement throughout the Country,\r\nthe suspension and failure of thousands of business firms, the\r\ndestruction of confidence in the stability and profitableness of\r\nAmerican industries, and great consequent suffering, and enforced\r\nidleness, to the working men and working women of the Land.\r\n\r\nThe sad recollection of these facts--made more poignant by the airy\r\ndeclaration of the Democratic Presidential candidate, that the great\r\nNational question of the Tariff is a mere \"local issue,\"--was largely\r\ninstrumental, in connection with the insolent aggressiveness of the\r\nSouthern leaders, in Congress, in occasioning their defeat in the\r\nPresidential contest of 1880, the Republican candidate receiving 214\r\nelectoral votes, while the Democratic candidate received but 155\r\nelectoral votes.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, the House of Representatives was under Republican control, and,\r\ndespite determined Democratic resistance, created a Tariff-commission,\r\nwhose duty it was \"to take into consideration, and to thoroughly\r\ninvestigate, all the various questions relating to the agricultural,\r\ncommercial, mercantile, manufacturing, mining, and (other) industrial\r\ninterests of the United States, so far as the same may be necessary to\r\nthe establishment of a judicious Tariff, or a revision of the existing\r\nTariff, upon a scale of justice to all interests.\"\r\n\r\nThat same year, in the face of most protracted and persistent opposition\r\nby the great bulk of Democratic members, both of the Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, and an effort to substitute for it the utterly ruinous\r\nDemocratic Free-Trade Tariff of 1846, the Bill recommended by this\r\nRepublican Tariff-commission, was enacted; and, in 1883, a modified\r\nTariff-measure, comprehending a large annual reduction of import duties,\r\nwhile also carefully preserving the great Republican American principle\r\nof Protection, was placed by the Republicans on the Statute-book,\r\ndespite the renewed and bitter opposition of the Democrats, who, as\r\nusual, fought it desperately in both branches of Congress.  But\r\nRepublican efforts failed in 1884, in the interest of the wool-growers\r\nof the country, to restore the Protective-duties on wool, which had been\r\nsacrificed, in 1883, to an exigency created by Democratic opposition to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnother Democratic effort, in the direction of Free-Trade, known as \"the\r\nMorrison Tariff-Bill of 1884,\" was made in the latter year, which,\r\nbesides increasing the free-list, by adding to it salt, coal, timber,\r\nand wood unmanufactured, as well as many manufactures thereof, decreased\r\nthe import duties \"horizontally\" on everything else to the extent of\r\ntwenty per cent.  The Republicans, aided by a few Democrats, killed this\r\nundigested and indigestible Democratic Bill, by striking out its\r\nenacting clause.\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, by dint of the incessant special-pleading in\r\nbehalf of the obnoxious and un-American doctrine of Free-Trade,--or the\r\nnearest possible approach to it, consistent with the absolutely\r\nessential collection of revenues for the mere support of the Government\r\n--indulged in (by some of the professors) in our colleges of learning;\r\nthrough a portion of the press; upon the stump; and in Congress;\r\ntogether with the liberal use of British gold in the wide distribution\r\nof printed British arguments in its favor,--this pernicious but favorite\r\nidea of the Solid South had taken such firm root in the minds of the\r\ngreater part of the Democratic Party in the North and West, as well as\r\nthe South, that a declaration in the National Democratic platform in its\r\nfavor was now looked for, as a matter of course.  The \"little leaven\" of\r\nthis monstrous un-American heresy seemed likely to leaven \"the whole\r\nmass\" of the Democracy.\r\n\r\nBut, as in spite of the tremendous advantage given to that Party by the\r\nunited vote of the Solid South, the Presidential contest of 1884 was\r\nlikely to be so close that, to give Democracy any chance to win, the few\r\nDemocrats opposed to Free-Trade must be quieted, the utterances of the\r\nDemocratic National Platform of that year, on the subject, were so\r\nwonderfully pieced, and ludicrously intermixed, that they could be\r\nconstrued to mean \"all things to all men.\"\r\n\r\nAt last, after an exciting campaign, the Presidential election of 1884\r\nwas held, and for the first time since 1856, the old Free-Trade\r\nDemocracy of the South could rejoice over the triumph of their\r\nPresidential candidate.\r\n\r\nGreat was the joy of the Solid South!  At last, its numberless crimes\r\nagainst personal Freedom, and political Liberty, would reap a generous\r\nharvest.  At last, participation in Rebellion would no more be regarded\r\nas a blot upon the political escutcheon.  At last, commensurate rewards\r\nfor all the long years of disconsolate waiting, and of hard work in\r\nnight ridings, and house-burnings, and \"nigger\"-whippings, and\r\n\"nigger\"-shootings, and \"nigger\"-hangings, and ballot-box stuffings, and\r\nall the other dreadful doings to which these old leaders were impelled\r\nby a sense of Solid-Southern patriotism, and pride of race, and lust for\r\npower, would come, and come in profusion.\r\n\r\nGrand places in the Cabinet, and foreign Missions, for the old Rebels of\r\ndistinction, now Chiefs of the \"Solid-Southern\" Conspiracy, and for\r\nthose other able Northern Democrats who had helped them, during or since\r\nthe Rebellion; fat consulates abroad, for others of less degree;\r\npost-offices, without stint, for the lesser lights; all this, and more,\r\nmust now come.  The long-hidden light of a glorious day was about to\r\nbreak. The \"restoration of the Government to the principles and\r\npractices of the earlier period,\" predicted by the unreconstructed\r\n\"Rebel chieftains\" those \"same principles for which they fought for four\r\nyears\" the principles of Southern Independence, Slavery, Free Trade and\r\nOligarchic rule--were now plainly in sight, and within reach!\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the Free-Trade Democracy, if continued to another\r\nPresidential election, would make Free-Trade a certainty.  The old forms\r\nof Slavery, to be sure, were dead beyond reanimation--perhaps; but, in\r\ntheir place, were other forms of Slavery, which attracted less attention\r\nand reprobation from the World at large, and yet were quite as effectual\r\nfor all Southern purposes.  The system of Peonage and contracted\r\nconvict-labor, growing out of the codes of Black laws, were\r\nall-sufficient to keep the bulk of the Negro race in practical subjection\r\nand bondage.  The solidifying of the South had already made the South\r\nnot only practically independent within the Union, but the overshadowing\r\npower, potential enough to make, and unmake, the rulers and policies of\r\nthe Democratic Party, and of that Union.\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, was a grand outcome for the tireless efforts of the once\r\ndefeated Conspirators!  And as to Oligarchal rule--the rule of the few\r\n(and those the Southern chiefs) over the many,--was not that already\r\naccomplished?  For these old Rebel leaders and oligarchs who had secured\r\nthe supreme rule over the Solid South, had also, through their ability\r\nto wield the power of that Solid South within the Union, actually\r\nsecured the power of practically governing the entire Union!\r\n\r\nThat Union, then, which we have been wont to look upon as the grandest,\r\nnoblest, freest, greatest Republic upon Earth,--is it really such, in\r\nall respects, at the present?  Does the Free Republic of the United\r\nStates exist, in fact, to-day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n                               WHAT NEXT?\r\n\r\nAnd what next?  Aye, what next?  Do the patriotic, innocent-minded\r\nlovers of a Republican form of Government imagine, for an instant, that\r\nall danger to its continued existence and well-being has ceased to\r\nthreaten?--that all the crises perilous to that beneficent popular\r\ngovernmental form have vanished?--that the climacteric came, and went,\r\nwith the breaking out, and suppression, of the Rebellion?--and that\r\nthere is nothing alarming in the outlook?  Quite likely.  The public\r\nmind has not yet been aroused to a sense of the actual revolution\r\nagainst Republican form of government that has already taken place in\r\nmany of the Southern States, much less as to the likelihood of things to\r\ncome.  The people of any one of the Western, or Northern States,--take\r\nNew York, for example,--feel prosperous and happy under the beneficent\r\nworkings of the Republican Protective-Tariff system.  Business, of all\r\nsorts, recovering from the numerous attacks made upon that prime bulwark\r\nof our American industries, if only let alone, will fairly hum, and look\r\nbright, so far as \"the Almighty dollar\" is concerned.  They know they\r\nhave their primaries and conventions, in their wards and counties\r\nthroughout their State, and their State Conventions, and their\r\nelections.  They know that the voice of the majority of their own\r\npeople, uttered through the sacred ballot-box, is practically the Vox\r\nDei--and that all bow to it.  They know also, that this State government\r\nof theirs, with all its ramifications--whether as to its Executive, its\r\nLegislative, its Judicial, and other officials, either elective or\r\nappointed--is a Republican form of government, in the American sense--in\r\nthe sense contemplated by the Fathers, when they incorporated into the\r\nrevered Constitution of our Country the vital words: \"The United States\r\nshall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of\r\ngovernment.\"  But they do not realize the vastly different condition of\r\nthings in many States of the Solid South, nor how it affects themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd what is this \"republican\" form of government, thus pledged?  It is\r\ntrue that there are not wanting respectable authorities whose\r\ndefinitions of the words \"republic,\" and \"republican,\" are strongly\r\ninharmonious with their true meaning, as correctly understood by the\r\ngreat bulk of Americans.  Thus, Brande asserts that \"A republic may be\r\neither a democracy or an aristocracy!\"--and proceeds to say: \"In the\r\nformer, the supreme power is vested in the whole body of the people, or\r\nin representatives elected by the people; in the latter, it is vested in\r\na nobility, or a privileged class of comparatively a small number of\r\npersons.\"  John Adams also wrote: \"The customary meanings of the words\r\nrepublic and commonwealth have been infinite.  They have been applied to\r\nevery Government under heaven; that of Turkey and that of Spain, as well\r\nas that of Athens and of Rome, of Geneva and San Marino.\"  But the true\r\nmeaning of the word \"republican\" as applied to a \"form of government,\"\r\nand as commonly and almost invariably understood by those who, above all\r\nothers in the wide World, should best understand and appreciate its\r\nblessings--to wit: the American People has none of the looseness and\r\nindefiniteness which these authorities throw about it.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing and correct American idea is that \"Republican\" means: of,\r\nor pertaining to, a Republic; that \"Republic\" means a thing, affair, or\r\nmatter, closely related to, and touching the \"public;\" and that the\r\n\"public\" are the \"people\"--not a small proportion of them, but \"the\r\npeople at large,\" the whole community, the Nation, the commonalty, the\r\ngenerality.  Hence, \"a Republican form of government\" is, in their\r\nopinion, plainly that form which is most closely identified with, and\r\nrepresentative of, the generality or majority of the people; or, in the\r\nlanguage of Dr. J. E. Worcester, it is \"That form of government or of a\r\nState, in which the supreme power is vested in the people, or in\r\nrepresentatives elected by the people.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that there can be no such thing as \"a republic,\" which is,\r\nat the same time, \"an aristocracy;\" for the moment that which was \"a\r\nrepublic\" becomes \"an aristocracy,\" that moment it ceases to be \"a\r\nrepublic.\"  So also can there be no such thing as \"a republic\" which is\r\n\"an oligarchy,\" for, as \"a republic\" is a government of the many, or, as\r\nPresident Lincoln well termed it, \"a government of the people, by the\r\npeople, for the people\"--so it must cease to be \"a republic,\" when the\r\nsupreme power is in the hands of the oligarchic few.\r\n\r\nThere can be but two kinds of republics proper--one a democratic\r\nrepublic, which is impossible for a great and populous Nation like ours,\r\nbut which may have answered for some of the small republics of ancient\r\nGreece; the other, a representative republic, such as is boasted by the\r\nUnited States.  And this is the kind palpably meant by the Fathers,\r\nwhen, for the very purpose of nipping in the bud any anti-republican\r\nConspiracy likely to germinate from Slavery, they inserted in the Great\r\nCharter of American Liberties the solemn and irrevocable mandate: \"The\r\nUnited States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican\r\nForm of Government.\"  That they meant this majority rule--this\r\ngovernment by the many, instead of the few--this rule of the People, as\r\nagainst any possible minority rule, by, or through, oligarchs or\r\naristocrats, is susceptible of proof in other ways.\r\n\r\nIt is a safe guide, in attempting to correctly expound the Constitution\r\nof the United States, to be careful that the construction insisted on,\r\nis compatible and harmonious with the spirit of that great instrument;\r\nso that--as was said by an eloquent and distinguished Massachusetts\r\nstatesman of twenty years ago, in discussing this very point--\"the\r\nguarantee of a Republican form of government must have a meaning\r\ncongenial with the purposes of the Constitution.\"  Those purposes, of\r\ncourse, are expressed in its preamble, or in the body of the instrument,\r\nor in both.  The preamble itself, in this case, is sufficient to show\r\nthem.  It commences with the significant words: \"We THE PEOPLE of the\r\nUnited States\"--words, instinct with the very consciousness of the\r\npossession of that supreme power by the People or public, which made\r\nthis not only a Nation, but a Republic; and, after stating the purposes\r\nor objects sought by the People in thus instituting this Republic,\r\nproceeds to use that supreme political power vested in them, by\r\nordaining and establishing \"this CONSTITUTION for the United States of\r\nAmerica.\"  And, from the very first article, down to the last, of that\r\n\"Constitution,\" or \"structure,\" or \"frame,\" or \"form\" of government,\r\nalready self-evidently and self-consciously and avowedly Republican,\r\nthat form is fashioned into a distinctively representative Republican\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe purposes themselves, as declared in the preamble, for which the\r\nPeople of the United States thus spake this representative Republic into\r\nbeing, are also full of light.  Those purposes were \"to form a more\r\nperfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquillity, provide\r\nfor the common defense, promote the General Welfare, and secure the\r\nBlessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.\"\r\n\r\nHow is it possible, for instance, that \"the Blessings\r\nof Liberty\" are to be secured to \"ourselves and our Posterity,\" if\r\ncitizens of the United States, despite the XVth Amendment of that\r\nConstitution, find-through the machinations of political organizations\r\n--their right to vote, both abridged and denied, in many of the States,\r\n\"on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude?\"  How,\r\nif, in such States, \"the right of the people to be secure in their\r\npersons, houses, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\r\nseizures,\" is habitually violated, despite the IVth Amendment of that\r\nConstitution?  How, if, in such States, persons are notoriously and\r\nfrequently \"deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process\r\nof law,\" in violation of the Vth Amendment of that Constitution?  Yet\r\nsuch is the state of affairs generally prevalent in many States of the\r\nSolid South.\r\n\r\nThese provisions in the Constitution were, with others, placed there for\r\nthe very purpose of securing \"the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and\r\nour Posterity,\" of promoting the \"General Welfare,\" of establishing\r\n\"Justice,\" of insuring \"domestic Tranquillity\" and making \"a more\r\nperfect Union\"--and the violation of those provisions, or any one of\r\nthem, in any part of our Land, by any part of our People, in any one of\r\nthe States, is not only subversive of the Constitution, and\r\nrevolutionary, but constitutes a demand, in itself, upon the National\r\nGovernment, to obey that imperative mandate of the Constitution (Sec. 4,\r\narticle IV.) comprehended in the words: \"The United States SHALL\r\nguarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.\"\r\n\r\n     [The meaning of these words is correctly given in an opinion of\r\n     Justice Bronson of New York (4 Hill's Reports, 146) in these words:\r\n\r\n     \"The meaning of the section then seems to be, that no member of the\r\n     State shall be disfranchised or deprived of any of his rights or\r\n     privileges unless the matter shall be adjudged against him upon\r\n     trial had according to the course of common law.  The words 'due\r\n     process of law' cannot mean less than a prosecution or suit\r\n     instituted and conducted according to the prescribed forms and\r\n     solemnities for ascertaining guilt or determining the title to\r\n     property.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is well that the truth should be spoken out, and known of all men.\r\nThe blame for this condition of things belongs partly to the Republican\r\nParty.  The question is sometimes asked: \"If these outrages against\r\ncitizenship, against the purity of the ballot, against humanity, against\r\nboth the letter and spirit of the Constitution of our Republic, are\r\nperpetrated, why is it that the Republican Party--so long in power\r\nduring their alleged perpetration--did not put a stop to them?\"  The\r\nanswer is: that while there are remedial measures, and measures of\r\nprevention, fully warranted by the Constitution--while there are\r\nConstitutional ways and means for the suppression of such outrages--yet,\r\nout of exceeding tenderness of heart, which prompted the hope and belief\r\nthat the folly of continuing them must ere long come home to the\r\nSouthern mind and conscience, the Republican Party has been loath to put\r\nthem in force.  The--best remedy of all, and the best manner of\r\nadministering it, lies with the people themselves, of those States where\r\nthese outrages are perpetrated.  Let them stop it.  The People of the\r\nUnited States may be long-suffering, and slow to wrath; but they will\r\nnot permit such things to continue forever.\r\n\r\nWhen the Rebellion was quelled, the evil spirit which brought it about\r\nshould have been utterly crushed out, and none of the questions involved\r\nin it should have been permitted to be raised again.  But the Republican\r\nParty acted from its heart, instead of its head.  It was merciful,\r\nforgiving, and magnanimous.  In the magnificent sweep of its generosity\r\nto the erring son, it perhaps failed to insure the exact justice to the\r\nother sons which was their right.  For, as has already been shown in\r\nthese pages, Free-Trade, imbedded in the Rebel Constitution, as well as\r\nSlavery, entered into and became a part, and an essential part, of the\r\nRebellion against the Union--to triumph with Slavery, if the Rebellion\r\nsucceeded--to fall with Slavery, if the Rebellion failed.  And, while\r\nSlavery and Free-Trade, were two leading ideas inspiring the Southern\r\nConspirators and leaders in their Rebellion; Freedom to Man, and\r\nProtection to Labor, were the nobler ideas inspiring those who fought\r\nfor the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Morrill-Tariff of 1860, with modifications to it subsequently made\r\nby its Republican friends, secured to the Nation, through the triumph of\r\nthe Union arms, great and manifold blessings and abundant prosperity\r\nflowing from the American Protective policy; while the Emancipation\r\nproclamations, together with the Constitutional amendments, and\r\nCongressional legislation, through the same triumph, and the acceptance\r\nof the legitimate results of the War, gave Freedom to all within the\r\nNation's bound aries.  This, at least, was the logical outcome of the\r\nfailure of the Rebellion.  Such was the general understanding, on all\r\nsides, at the conclusion of the War.  Yet the Republican Party, in\r\nfailing to stigmatize the heresy of Free Trade--which had so large an\r\nagency in bringing about the equally heretical doctrines of State\r\nSovereignty and the right of Secession, and Rebellion itself,--as an\r\nissue or question settled by the War, as a part and parcel of the\r\nRebellion, was guilty of a grave fault of omission, some of the\r\nill-effects of which have already been felt, while others are yet to\r\ncome. For, quickly after the War of the Rebellion closed,--as has been\r\nalready mentioned--the defeated Rebel leaders, casting in their lot with\r\ntheir Democratic friends and allies, openly and without special rebuke,\r\nprevailed upon the National Democracy to adopt the Rebel Free-Trade\r\nShibboleth of \"a Tariff for revenue;\" and that same Democracy, obtaining\r\npower and place, through violence and fraud and falsehood at the\r\nso-called \"elections\" in the Solid Southern States, now threatens the\r\nCountry once more with iniquitous Free-Trade legislation, and all its\r\nattendant train of commercial disasters and general industrial ruin.\r\n\r\nWere Abraham Lincoln able bodily to revisit the United States to-day,\r\nhow his keen gray eyes would open in amazement, to find that many\r\nlegitimate fruits of our Union victories had been filched from us; that\r\n--save the honorable few, who, accepting the legitimate results of the\r\nWar, were still honestly striving for the success of principles\r\nharmonizing with such results, and inuring to the general welfare--they\r\nwho strove with all their might to wreck the Government,--were now,\r\n--through the fraudulent and forcible restriction of voters in their right\r\nto vote--at the helm of State; that these, who sought to ruin the\r\nNation, had thus wrongfully usurped its rule; that Free-Trade--after\r\n\"running-a-muck\" of panic and disaster, from the birth of the Republic,\r\nto the outbreak of the Rebellion, with whose failure it should naturally\r\nhave expired--was now reanimated, and stood, defiantly threatening all\r\nthe great industries of our Land; that all his own painstaking efforts,\r\nand those of the band of devoted Patriots who stood by him to free the\r\nSouthern Slaves, had mainly resulted in hiding from sight the repulsive\r\nchains of enforced servitude, under the outward garb of Freedom; that\r\nthe old Black codes had simply been replaced by enactments adapted to\r\nthe new conditions; that the old system of African Slavery had merely\r\nbeen succeeded by the heartless and galling system of African Peonage;\r\nthat the sacrifices made by him--including that of his martyrdom--had,\r\nto a certain extent, been made in vain; that all the sacrifices, the\r\nsorrows, the sufferings, of this Nation, made in blood, in tears, and in\r\nvast expenditures of time and treasure, had, in some degree, and in a\r\ncertain sense, been useless; that the Union, to be sure, was saved--but\r\nsaved to be measurably perverted from its grand purpose; that the power\r\nwhich animated Rebellion and which was supposed to have expired in the\r\n\"last ditch\" with the \"Lost Cause\" had, by political legerdemain and\r\njugglery and violence, been regained; that the time had actually come\r\nfor Patriots to take back seats, while unrepentant Rebels came to the\r\nfront; that the Republic still lived, but only by sufferance, with the\r\nhands of Southern oligarchs about its palpitating throat--a Republic,\r\nnot such as he expected, where all men are equal before the law, and\r\nprotected in their rights, but where the rights of a certain class are\r\npersistently trampled under foot; that the people of the Northern,\r\nMiddle, and Western States, observing nothing beyond their own vicinage,\r\nso to speak, and finding that each of their own States is still\r\nRepublican in its form of government, persistently, and perversely, shut\r\ntheir eyes to the election terrorism practiced in the Solid South by,\r\nwhich the 16 solid, Southern States were, and are, solidified by these\r\nconspiring oligarchs into one compact, and powerful, political mass,\r\never ready to be hurled, in and out of Congress, against the best\r\ninterests of the Nation--16 States, not all \"Republican\" in form, but\r\nmany of them Despotisms, in substance,--16 States, misnamed\r\n\"Democratic,\" many of them ruled not by a majority, but by an\r\nOligarch-ridden minority--16 States, leagued, banded, bound solidly\r\ntogether, as one great controlling Oligarchy, to hold, in its merciless\r\nand selfish hands, the balance of power within this Republican Union;\r\nand that these confederated Southern States are now actually able to\r\ndictate to all the other States of the Union, the particular man, or\r\nmen, to whose rule the Nation must submit, and the particular policy, or\r\npolicies, which the Nation must adopt and follow:\r\n\r\n\"What next?\"--you ask--\"What next?\"  Alas, it is not difficult to\r\npredict!  Power, lawlessly gained, is always mercilessly used.  Power,\r\nusurped, is never tamely surrendered.  The old French proverb, that\r\n\"revolutions never go backward,\" is as true to-day, as when it was\r\nwritten.  Already we see the signs of great preparations throughout the\r\nSolid South.  Already we hear the shout of partisan hosts marshalled\r\nbehind the leaders of the disarmed Rebellion, in order that the same old\r\npolitical organization which brought distress upon this Land shall again\r\ncontrol the Government.  Already the spirit of the former aggressiveness\r\nis defiantly bestirring itself.  The old chieftains intend to take no\r\nmore chances.  They feel that their Great Conspiracy is now assured of\r\nsuccess, inside the Union.  They hesitate not to declare that the power\r\nonce held by them, and temporarily lost, is regained.  Like the Old Man\r\nof the Sea, they are now on top, and they:\r\n\r\n                     MEAN TO KEEP THERE--IF THEY CAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL ADDENDUM: As few readers 150 years later know of John Logan\r\nit seemed appropriate to the eBook editor to append this short biography\r\ntaken from the Encyclopedia Britanica of 1911:\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGAN, JOHN ALEXANDER (1826-1886),\r\nAmerican soldier and political leader, was born in what is now\r\nMurphysborough, Jackson county, Illinois, on the 9th of February 1826.\r\nHe had no schooling until he was fourteen; he then studied for three\r\nyears in Shiloh College, served in the Mexican War as a lieutenant of\r\nvolunteers, studied law in the office of an uncle, graduated from the\r\nLaw Department of Louisville University in 1851, and practised law with\r\nsuccess.  He entered politics as a Douglas Democrat, was elected county\r\nclerk in 1849, served in the State House of Representatives in 1853-1854\r\nand in 1857, and for a time, during the interval, was prosecuting\r\nattorney of the Third Judicial District of Illinois.  In 1858 and 1860\r\nhe was elected as a Democrat to the National House of Representatives.\r\nThough unattached and unenlisted, he fought at Bull Run, and then\r\nreturned to Washington, resigned his seat, and entered the Union army as\r\ncolonel of the 31st Illinois Volunteers, which he organized.  He was\r\nregarded as one of the ablest officers who entered the army from civil\r\nlife.  In Grant's campaigns terminating in the capture of Vicksburg,\r\nwhich city Logan's division was the first to enter and of which he was\r\nmilitary governor, he rose to the rank of major-general of volunteers;\r\nin November 1863 he succeeded Sherman in command of the XV. Army Corps;\r\nand after the death of McPherson he was in command of the Army of the\r\nTennessee at the battle of Atlanta.  When the war closed, Logan resumed\r\nhis political career as a Republican, and was a member of the National\r\nHouse of Representatives from 1867 to 1871, and of the United States\r\nSenate from 1871 until 1877 and again from 1879 until his death, which\r\ntook place at Washington, D.C., on the 26th of December 1886.  In 1868\r\nhe was one of the managers in the impeachment of President Johnson.  His\r\nwar record and his great personal following, especially in the Grand\r\nArmy of the Republic, contributed to his nomination for Vice-President\r\nin 1884 on the ticket with James G. Blaine, but he was not elected.\r\nHis impetuous oratory was popular on the platform.  He was\r\ncommander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic from 1868 to 1871,\r\nand in this position successfully urged the observance of Memorial or\r\nDecoration Day, an idea which probably originated with him.  He was the\r\nauthor of \"The Great Conspiracy: Its Origin and History\" (1886), an\r\naccount of the Civil War, and of \"The Volunteer Soldier of America\"\r\n(1887).  There is a fine statue of him by St. Gaudens in Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe best biography is that by George F. Dawson, The Life and Services\r\nof Gen. John A.  Logan, as Soldier and Statesman (Chicago and New York,\r\n1887).",
